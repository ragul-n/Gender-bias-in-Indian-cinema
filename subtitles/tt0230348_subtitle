3
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,753
- Who's come?
- Sunder's mother is here.

4
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,056
Who's Sunder?

5
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,860
Your mother had fixed your
marriage with him, in childhood.

6
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,295
Yes. Come on, hurry!

7
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:07,670
What's the problem? You can
have Sunder meet Nisha any time.

8
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:10,907
- It will be of no use.
- Why? Because he has no wealth?

9
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:14,477
And because he has no wealth,
you want to break his heart!

10
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,780
- I'm not breaking his heart?!
- You most certainly are!

11
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:22,018
As a child, I have drilled into
his head that he'd marry Nisha.

12
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:27,023
He's not met Nisha but she
is the queen of his dreams.

13
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:31,227
Now, should I go
and tell him that...

14
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:35,265
the one he'd worship in his
dreams will never enter his life?

15
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:39,035
Look! These useless talks
will have no effect on me!

16
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,271
I have told you,
it is impossible!

17
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,776
Many years ago, some man had
said the same words to you.

18
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:52,081
The father of your wife, Kamla,
was also a rich man.

19
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,084
And you were poor then.

20
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,087
But victory was yours, not his.

21
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:03,993
Kamla had left everything for you
but you have forgotten that.

22
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,698
Do bear in mind that
your wealth will never triumph!

23
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:13,036
The promise that Kamla and I
made to each other will triumph!

24
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,424
A penny for your thoughts!

25
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:42,298
Is it true that my mother had
fixed my marriage with her son?

26
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:43,789
Yes.

27
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,835
Then, why is father refusing?

28
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,138
What do you want?

29
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,341
Me? ...
 have never
even thought about it.

30
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,145
- But...
- But what?

31
00:03:55,736 --> 00:04:00,583
If a boy enters my life someday,
and I fall in love with him...

32
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:04,721
will father
reject him also then?

33
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,389
- Certainly.
- Why?

34
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:10,260
Because he has already
fixed your marriage.

35
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,362
- With whom?
- With him.

36
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,755
Well-done! You are amazing!

37
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:42,959
I have personally supervised all
the work since the last few days.

38
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,494
Please sit.

39
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,234
Sohan, I often think, if not for
you, it'd have been impossible...

40
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,004
for me to manage
my business in this age.

41
00:04:57,064 --> 00:05:01,077
Your father Mohanlal and I used
to study together in college.

42
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,146
If he were alive today...

43
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,782
I'd have spoken about Nisha
to him, not to you.

44
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,486
I will be indebted
to you forever.

45
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,721
Bless you.

46
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,324
I called you now
because Nisha and I...

47
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,327
will be leaving for
Darjeeling by today's train.

48
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,363
Nisha and her college friends
will be holding a show...

49
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,600
for the Bengal relief fund.
And even I have some work there.

50
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:26,169
- But you have to go to the farm.
- Why?

51
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,805
We've got to finalise the
disputed land dealing tomorrow.

52
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,839
- Tomorrow itself?
- Yes.

53
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,175
Do you have some
urgent work in Darjeeling?

54
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,112
Yes... What do I hide from you?

55
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,183
20 years ago, I had bought
some land on lease...

56
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,585
from Mr. Mafatlal of Calcutta.

57
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,556
The lease will expire in another
6 months. Mafatlal is no more.

58
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,425
His son, Popatlal, who has
just returned from abroad...

59
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,995
refuses to rent it
on lease again.

60
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,231
- So, did you meet Popatlal?
- No. I haven't even seen him.

61
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,469
But I believe
he is in Darjeeling now.

62
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:02,839
I'm planning to go there,
meet him and bring him here.

63
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:06,776
I'll shower my hospitality
on him and convince him.

64
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,846
Not a bad idea. But it's
important, you remain here too.

65
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:17,353
Don't worry. I will lock Popatlal
in a cage and bring him here!

66
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,956
Hear, hear!

67
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,774
I've written so many letters to
him but received no replies.

68
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,397
And she is going to lock Popatlal
in a cage and bring him!

69
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,432
- Leave that to me.
- All right, I will!

70
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,435
Go talk to him
and bring him here.

71
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,105
Once he is here,
I will handle him accordingly.

72
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,304
I will go and make the
arrangements right away!

73
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:43,947
Crazy!

74
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:47,250
Mother, it's better
that you forget about this.

75
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:48,875
About what?

76
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,287
That my marriage with Nisha
was ever fixed.

77
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,160
- Why should I forget?!
- Because I have put it behind me.

78
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,494
I've even forgotten her dad...

79
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:00,997
whom I'd met for the
first time in Calcutta last year.

80
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:04,901
I gathered then that
this was just not right.

81
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,519
And I immediately stopped
fostering any love for Nisha.

82
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,407
You are lying!

83
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:15,211
You're dejected but pretend to
be indifferent to make me happy!

84
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:18,915
But nothing is the matter!
Nisha is not the only girl!

85
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:22,085
There are thousands of other
beautiful girls in this world.

86
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,221
No! You will marry only Nisha!

87
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:27,957
H ow?

88
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,860
I will pray to God.

89
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:32,885
Pray?

90
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:36,266
Yes. Do you know, I dreamt
about my friend Kamla?

91
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:42,305
Seeing me disheartened,
she asked me not to worry.

92
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,508
As nobody could
breach our promise.

93
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:51,014
She told me that nobody else but
my son, Sunder, would wed Nisha!

94
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:55,318
Did she actually say so?
Did you thank her on my behalf?

95
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:59,556
Forget it. Let me
get to the point now.

96
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,453
I'm going by train to Neelgaon
tomorrow or the day after that.

97
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,861
No. I have found a job.

98
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,464
A big landlord requires
a qualified engineer.

99
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,099
He's constructing roads on the
hills. It will be a year's job.

100
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,683
I'll be getting 500 per month and
a bungalow and helper for free.

101
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,270
Here's the letter.

102
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,140
This is called
the miracle of God!

103
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:18,598
Meaning?

104
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:21,978
Mother!

105
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,019
What is it?

106
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:33,523
You've been at home all along!
Now, come with me!

107
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:34,981
Where?

108
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,488
A fantastic song & dance program
for the Bengal relief fund...

109
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,329
will be held today.

110
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,332
I have a free pass, so I
thought I'd take you along too.

111
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:43,823
Go alone.

112
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,370
The lovely maidens of Darjeeling
will be dancing...

113
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,573
who have driven half of the
city's boys into becoming poets!

114
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:54,377
The remaining have been dejected
and are wandering in the jungles!

115
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,579
Here, take a look.

116
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,290
Where are you lost!

117
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,816
What are you doing?!
Somebody will see us!

118
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:49,242
Quiet.

119
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,863
What's your program
for tomorrow?

120
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,487
I will be returning to Neelgaon
by train tomorrow night.

121
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,969
We know that. But what will you
be doing the entire day tomorrow?

122
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,972
- I have some important work.
- To hell with that!

123
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,108
- Let's go for a picnic tomorrow.
- Yes, let's go!

124
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,777
Father has asked me
to meet somebody.

125
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,915
So, will you be meeting him
the entire day?

126
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:21,584
Father had leased some land...
from a businessman Mr. Mafatlal...

127
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,621
in Calcutta, 20 years ago.

128
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:28,792
He is no more, and his son
refuses to extend the lease.

129
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:33,363
His name is Popatlal, and he
is in Darjeeling these days.

130
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,366
Fantastic!
How does Popatlal look?

131
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,868
I haven't even see him.

132
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,504
I phoned his hotel today
but he was not available.

133
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:44,475
I've left a message asking him
to meet me at 9 a.m. tomorrow...

134
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,075
.or phone me.

135
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:49,879
- But what will you talk to him?
- I don't want to talk to him!

136
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:52,482
Father had asked me to
bring him to Neelgaon somehow.

137
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:55,685
Once he reaches there,
father will somehow convince him.

138
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,321
But why should he want
to get convinced?

139
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:03,293
Once I ask a man to come along,
it's difficult for him to refuse!

140
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,794
_ Really?
_ Yes!

141
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,497
If you don't believe me, then
come and see tomorrow morning.

142
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,399
How he will swoon over me!

143
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:12,635
We'll come to the hotel tomorrow.

144
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,389
At 9 a.m.

145
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,764
Good morning, Ms. Nisha. There's
a gentleman here to meet you.

146
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:51,608
He's here!
Yes? ls his name Mr. Popatlal?

147
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,676
Is your name Mr. Popatlal?

148
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,746
Yes, it is Mr. Popatlal.

149
00:14:05,813 --> 00:14:09,859
You can well imagine how a boy
whose name is Popatlal looks!

150
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,317
H ow?

151
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:14,497
Dark, short, with his stomach
coming out of his shirt!

152
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:18,958
Hide!

153
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,168
Popatlal has
just one 'po' in it!

154
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:54,404
- What?
- Yes!

155
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:56,806
However, my friends
in London call me Monto.

156
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:01,678
May I come in?

157
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:13,423
Let's sit?

158
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:23,399
- Are you alone here?
- Yes.

159
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:24,968
- Tell me.
- Pardon?

160
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:28,471
- Well, you called me here.
- What... Oh yes!

161
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:32,542
I did call you. You do know that
I am Mr. Roop Singh's daughter.

162
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,478
It's obvious, looking at you!

163
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,215
So, why did you want to meet me?

164
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,687
I didn't want to meet you. My
father had asked me to meet you.

165
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,023
Well, your father
is quite sensible!

166
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:48,525
- What!
- Yes.

167
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:51,528
- That's for me.
- For you?

168
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:56,134
I mentioned at the reception that
I was expecting a phone call.

169
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:02,939
Hello. This is
Popatlal speaking.

170
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:06,743
Congratulations!!

171
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:13,116
Not congratulations but Popatlal!
I want to speak to Ms. Nisha.

172
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:16,719
- She doesn't want to talk to you.
- What! Who are you?

173
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,491
I now know what a despicable
and wretched person you are!

174
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,128
Stop saying what!
I could break your head!

175
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,340
Do you know the outcome
of being so impertinent?!

176
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:31,034
If you are her bodyguard,
then I can have you sacked!

177
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,625
Really?

178
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,574
Mr. Sardar writes letters,
appeasing me all the time.

179
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:38,241
And you, his servant,
dares to talk to me so rudely!

180
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,044
Absolutely! Our policies differ.

181
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:44,848
I know how to deal with crooked
men like you! I'll whip you now!

182
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,718
Stop that!
I'll make mincemeat of you!

183
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:51,654
I'll teach you a lesson!

184
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:55,928
Were you fighting with somebody?

185
00:16:56,483 --> 00:17:00,497
Fight? He was an old friend from
Calcutta. This is how we talk.

186
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:01,998
I was afraid.

187
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,435
Yes. Villagers get
frightened very easily.

188
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:07,133
What do you mean by villagers?!

189
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:09,506
You're from Neelgaon, right?

190
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:10,963
So what?

191
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:14,010
I've always been in Darjeeling
and done my B.A. also from here.

192
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:18,615
Yes! Even the villages
have progressed quite a bit.

193
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,684
Your father asked you
to meet me, huh?

194
00:17:22,443 --> 00:17:26,856
Yes. He'll be very happy if you
come to Neelgaon with me tonight.

195
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,060
- With you?
- Yes.

196
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:35,098
It's a beautiful place having
lovely gardens, lovely animals...

197
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:39,102
Look! These gardens, flowers,
animals do not fascinate me.

198
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:43,106
Don't mind but I'm from the city.
I've lived in metropolises.

199
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:47,110
Gardens, flowers and animals
cannot draw me there.

200
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:51,114
But yes! If there's something
that can lure me, it is your...

201
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:53,650
beautiful eyes!

202
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,523
So, will you be coming with me?

203
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,150
No.

204
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:06,452
Why?

205
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:10,033
Your father and me are not of the
same age. Whom will I talk to?

206
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,569
To me.

207
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:16,873
- Whom will I go out with?
- With me.

208
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:22,512
I admit your eyes are lovely
but eyes don't mean everything.

209
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,080
- No?
- No.

210
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:27,117
A man tries to get to the heart.

211
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,820
But if there is the love of
an animal in that heart...

212
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:32,922
then you can
well imagine the outcome!

213
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:36,126
- I don't quite understand.
- I'll explain.

214
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:40,663
I'll speak about the moon and
stars, you'll talk of vegetables!

215
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:45,168
I'll speak of couplets, you'll
talk of your buffalo milking...

216
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:48,171
What are you saying?! Do I
look that rustic to you?!

217
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,509
Villagers start fighting
for no rhyme or reason!

218
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:52,308
You're the one fighting!

219
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:55,178
Do you know I can discuss any
issue of the world with you?!

220
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:59,182
I am well versed with all types
of songs and dance!

221
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:03,553
You may be speaking the truth but
I wonder why I'm not convinced!

222
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,890
Can you actually sing and dance?

223
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,593
Please don't start now!
I have absolutely no time.

224
00:19:11,118 --> 00:19:13,930
I have to go to Darjeeling club
to watch Ms. Pony's dance program.

225
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:15,899
Do you know Ms. Pony?

226
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,134
So, did you have him
swoon over you?!

227
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:21,938
Just you wait! I'll make him
come to his senses right away!

228
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,529
H ow?

229
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:27,143
If I don't make Ms. Donkey of
Ms. Pony, then I'll be damned!

230
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,646
Sit here, while I go
and get ready!

231
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,288
Good Lord!
She's like lightning!

232
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:44,016
We certainly won't come, Nisha!

233
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,189
No problem. I'll go.

234
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:26,656
- Why did you do that?!
- Quiet!

235
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:50,213
- I am badly wounded.
- Where?

236
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,517
Where have you got hurt?

237
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:56,719
On my knee.

238
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,426
Arrogant lad! He thinks
I'm crazy about him!

239
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,429
I could make you go crazy!

240
00:28:07,054 --> 00:28:12,168
I admit you are quite smart but
I don't give a damn about you!

241
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:15,672
The flames have erupted.
It's difficult to douse them!

242
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:18,675
Father has asked me
to bring you along...

243
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:21,177
or I wouldn't be with you
for even a minute!

244
00:28:21,635 --> 00:28:25,515
However, if you speak to me
properly, I could like you.

245
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:28,351
But love? ...lmpossible!

246
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:31,721
- Love? Impossible?
- Absolutely!

247
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,725
No... I remembered a dialogue
from a drama.

248
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,727
From the drama of life?

249
00:28:38,252 --> 00:28:39,863
No! Certainly not!

250
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:44,534
- Why doesn't the truck stop?
- It stops for two reasons.

251
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:48,271
One, if the engine fails and two,
if it collides with an ox!

252
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:49,939
You talk so strangely!

253
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:51,917
In London, the girls
wouldn't think so.

254
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:53,843
But the girls back home
deem it strange!

255
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:57,580
Where have I got myself trapped!

256
00:28:58,172 --> 00:29:01,651
Do you think I am
very pleased to be with you?!

257
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:04,736
Even if you are, how can you say
so? You want your type of a man!

258
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:06,790
What do you mean by my type?!

259
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:08,458
Do you want to argue with me?

260
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:13,229
You're the one who wants to! Ever
since I've met you, you... you...

261
00:29:15,723 --> 00:29:19,235
Keep your arms around me this
way... Say that you are angry.

262
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:30,747
Friend, this is amazing!
Where have you brought us?

263
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:32,205
Pardon?

264
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:34,026
We were in a rush.
Your truck was before us.

265
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:36,252
But we've
come elsewhere... Right?

266
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:39,956
- How far are we from the city?
- 25-30 miles.

267
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:43,293
25-30 miles! Good Lord!
I say, buddy...

268
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,830
repair this and take us back.
I'll give you Rs.20.

269
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:49,833
- We don't have any time.
- Come on now! Take Rs.30.

270
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:53,837
Here are some crisp notes!
Come on, agree!

271
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:58,641
Take this.

272
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,645
You look like a
newly married couple.

273
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:05,381
No, we are not yet married.

274
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:08,485
- You will be, soon?
- Something like that!

275
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:11,397
Repair it. I'll go with her.

276
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,093
Check out his wallet.
There must be around Rs.500.

277
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:18,695
I was thinking the same.

278
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,565
- Do you have some 'ladoo'?
- A box full! I'll feed them.

279
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:26,736
That moustached man
is a strange fool!

280
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,939
"You look like a
newly married couple!"

281
00:30:30,397 --> 00:30:32,542
Do you look like my wife
in any respect?!

282
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,240
Well, neither do you look like
my husband in any respect!

283
00:30:35,402 --> 00:30:36,913
- Exactly!
- That's what I'm saying too!

284
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:39,949
Sir, these are my engagement
sweets. Please have them.

285
00:30:40,574 --> 00:30:43,653
Fantastic! I'm hungry too!
Please have, madam.

286
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:45,791
- I don't want it!
- Please don't say that.

287
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:48,291
- You'll break a poor man's heart.
- Yes, you will.

288
00:31:11,305 --> 00:31:12,505
The sky is spinning, isn't it?

289
00:31:12,906 --> 00:31:14,017
Yes, very swiftly.

290
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:18,054
It's not the sky
but our heads spinning!

291
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:21,491
- They've added something to this.
- What?

292
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:23,760
- Some narcotic.
- Narcotic?

293
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:27,363
They have very
dangerous intentions.

294
00:31:27,855 --> 00:31:29,299
What will they do?

295
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,568
I don't know
what they feel about you.

296
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:35,171
But I think they found my wallet
more appealing than you.

297
00:31:35,662 --> 00:31:36,662
Meaning?

298
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,742
My senses are totally numbed.

299
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:42,512
And they will vanish with
my wallet with great ease.

300
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:52,722
What's so funny?

301
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,825
You were being very smart, huh?
It will be fun now!

302
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:59,729
And suppose they take you also
away with my wallet, then?

303
00:32:00,354 --> 00:32:01,965
Why would they do that?

304
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:05,735
They would know why.
But it is possible.

305
00:32:10,364 --> 00:32:11,975
- Then do something.
- What?

306
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:15,779
Those men will abduct me,
and you won't react?!

307
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:20,984
I'm helpless. If we were in love,
I'd have staked my life.

308
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:22,685
But that's not the case.

309
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:26,823
It isn't so.
I like you very much.

310
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:31,227
How does just liking me help?

311
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:37,834
I... I... I even love you.

312
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:39,792
Really?

313
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:41,461
Yes.

314
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:42,962
How much?

315
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,741
This much!

316
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:47,077
Are you trying to fool me?

317
00:32:47,868 --> 00:32:52,082
What? ...No way!
I really love you.

318
00:32:52,573 --> 00:32:56,619
My heart holds many a
desires and wishes for you.

319
00:32:57,077 --> 00:32:59,122
I mean I...

320
00:33:02,383 --> 00:33:04,794
You cannot look into the eyes
of a person when you are lying.

321
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,599
Even if you didn't feign to be in
love with me, I'd risk my life.

322
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:16,306
They're coming.

323
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:19,776
- Now do as told.
- Okay.

324
00:33:20,234 --> 00:33:23,046
- Laugh like a madman.
- Okay.

325
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:21,104
But how much money did
you lose, trying to save me?

326
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:23,306
- Not a penny.
- Meaning?

327
00:34:24,131 --> 00:34:25,308
I mean.

328
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,500
Hey!

329
00:34:28,102 --> 00:34:29,646
Do you appreciate me now?

330
00:34:44,551 --> 00:34:46,162
Let's scoot from here.

331
00:35:28,562 --> 00:35:30,373
I can't run anymore.

332
00:35:31,065 --> 00:35:35,679
No problem.
They can't catch us now.

333
00:35:49,617 --> 00:35:50,737
Are you feeling intoxicated?

334
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:55,031
- What about you?
- Yes. Twice as intoxicated.

335
00:35:55,856 --> 00:35:59,035
One, due to the 'ladoo' I ate,
and the other, due to these eyes.

336
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:03,873
They are indeed very beautiful!

337
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:05,942
Goodness gracious!

338
00:42:11,165 --> 00:42:13,276
When you wake up, I'll be gone.

339
00:42:13,734 --> 00:42:16,379
Whatever transpired with me,
has never happened before.

340
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:19,582
And I suppose, it's never
happened with you either.

341
00:42:20,074 --> 00:42:21,684
I know it was
the effect of the drug.

342
00:42:22,142 --> 00:42:26,056
But had it been the effect of
love, imagine the outcome then!

343
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:30,593
It's simple. If you wish to test,
then call out Monto thrice.

344
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:32,629
I'll be there.

345
00:42:50,804 --> 00:42:51,881
HE'S left?!

346
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:09,599
You said you'd be leaving
tomorrow or the day after that.

347
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,410
And now, you're leaving suddenly?

348
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:14,637
It's the question of my job.
I have to go soon.

349
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:17,440
- Shall I come along too?
- No, mother, not as yet.

350
00:43:18,032 --> 00:43:21,077
Let me settle things
in the cottage first.

351
00:43:21,535 --> 00:43:24,280
I wanted Nisha
to meet you just once.

352
00:43:25,306 --> 00:43:28,651
Once she agrees, then her father
will never be able to refuse her.

353
00:43:29,143 --> 00:43:30,143
I see.

354
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,688
I believe
he loves her very much.

355
00:43:32,146 --> 00:43:33,146
I see.

356
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:36,693
Hey! Are you listening to me
or just saying, I see?

357
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:38,151
I see.

358
00:43:38,786 --> 00:43:41,932
Mother, don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

359
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:46,736
- I'll leave now.
- Wait. Let me kiss you.

360
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:54,544
Porter!

361
00:44:20,094 --> 00:44:21,204
Hurry up!

362
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,761
Hey you! What is it?!

363
00:44:45,419 --> 00:44:46,763
The matter is very dangerous.

364
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:50,567
What's wrong?

365
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:53,303
There's somebody else here
other than the two of us.

366
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:54,761
Who?

367
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:57,107
- A girl.
- A girl?!

368
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:00,199
- She's inside.
- Inside!

369
00:45:02,803 --> 00:45:05,181
- She's very beautiful.
- Beautiful!

370
00:45:05,673 --> 00:45:07,017
But absolutely insane!

371
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:45,488
A song! I'll sing a song!

372
00:46:00,394 --> 00:46:02,539
You rascal! I'll teach you
a lesson right away!

373
00:47:50,304 --> 00:47:53,917
But had it been the effect of
love, imagine the outcome then!

374
00:47:54,408 --> 00:47:59,889
It's simple. If you wish to test,
then call out Monto thrice.

375
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,625
I'll be there.

376
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:25,682
I knew you were going
to be in a bad shape.

377
00:48:26,307 --> 00:48:27,917
- Really?
- Don't worry.

378
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:30,420
One endures
great distress in love!

379
00:48:30,878 --> 00:48:33,356
It's not your fault, for fire
rages in your heart too...

380
00:48:33,814 --> 00:48:35,425
.as it does, in mine.

381
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,965
You are wrong. There's no
such thing happening here.

382
00:48:42,423 --> 00:48:44,134
- Pardon?
- No fire rages in my heart.

383
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:46,102
- No?
- Absolutely not!

384
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,737
Then, why did you call me?

385
00:48:48,362 --> 00:48:50,774
To prove to you
that I know you're here!

386
00:48:51,365 --> 00:48:52,976
- You don't need me at all?
- No!

387
00:48:53,434 --> 00:48:55,434
- Me going away won't affect you?
- Absolutely not!

388
00:48:55,502 --> 00:48:57,480
- You won't mind?
- Not even a bit!

389
00:48:57,938 --> 00:48:59,482
- Believe me, I'll go!
- Go ahead!

390
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:01,851
I shall jump
from a moving train!

391
00:49:02,342 --> 00:49:03,342
Go on!

392
00:49:03,577 --> 00:49:05,522
You will run and hold me back.

393
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,458
If you say, shall I
open the door for you?

394
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:10,894
- Is that so?
- Yes, it is.

395
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:15,098
Watch how a life is taken!

396
00:49:19,827 --> 00:49:22,939
"0' picturesque landscape,
0' twinkling stars and moon!"

397
00:49:23,397 --> 00:49:24,741
"Be witness to my death!"

398
00:49:25,332 --> 00:49:29,746
Madam, your love is going to
die for you! My final salute!

399
00:53:41,922 --> 00:53:44,067
- So, when will we meet?
- What do you mean?

400
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:46,937
I mean you will go home,
and I will search for a hotel.

401
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:51,141
Don't you know there's no hotel
here? This is a remote place.

402
00:53:51,732 --> 00:53:54,144
And anyway, father has
invited you. Come home with me.

403
00:53:54,735 --> 00:53:55,735
But...

404
00:53:55,803 --> 00:53:58,515
You think you shouldn't go since
he's not here to receive you?

405
00:53:58,972 --> 00:54:00,950
Well, father is not
at home right now.

406
00:54:01,442 --> 00:54:03,242
He has gone to settle
a disputed land dealing.

407
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:04,954
He'll be back in a day or two.

408
00:54:05,446 --> 00:54:08,758
This means, it's just
you and me at home!

409
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,261
My aunt is also there.

410
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:19,803
Move aside!
Impertinent man!

411
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:24,808
Take the luggage and go out.
I'll fetch a newspaper.

412
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,610
Porter, pick the bags.

413
00:54:38,746 --> 00:54:40,190
I told you,
she is absolutely crazy.

414
00:54:40,748 --> 00:54:43,493
She must have taken away
my luggage. Go and check.

415
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:44,951
Porter!

416
00:54:51,992 --> 00:54:53,170
Bring it out.

417
00:54:54,795 --> 00:54:56,406
Get my umbrella.

418
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,080
Excuse me, are you Mr. Popatlal?

419
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:04,080
- Damn! This is bad!
- Why? What happened?

420
00:55:04,672 --> 00:55:07,283
Sir, I am
Mr. Roop Singh's accountant.

421
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,719
When he heard that
you were in Darjeeling...

422
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:11,821
he left to meet you there.

423
00:55:13,714 --> 00:55:15,325
He's taken a
lot of money with him.

424
00:55:15,783 --> 00:55:17,327
- Do we have to return?
- Most certainly.

425
00:55:17,351 --> 00:55:19,829
- When is the next train?
- This will go after 10 minutes.

426
00:55:20,287 --> 00:55:22,132
Secretary, put the bags inside.

427
00:55:28,762 --> 00:55:30,106
Sorry, I got a bit delayed.

428
00:55:44,411 --> 00:55:48,591
Mr. Sohan, you told Mr. Roop Singh
that you were meeting Banwari.

429
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:52,429
But you have come here instead.
What's all this?

430
00:56:23,784 --> 00:56:25,395
- How much is this?
- 3,000.

431
00:56:25,986 --> 00:56:27,664
You had promised 10,000.

432
00:56:28,155 --> 00:56:30,400
How can I arrange for money
every second or third month?

433
00:56:30,891 --> 00:56:33,436
If Mr. Roop Singh suspects,
my job will be at stake, and...

434
00:56:33,961 --> 00:56:36,940
And if you try my patience too
much, your life will be at stake!

435
00:56:37,564 --> 00:56:40,110
But what can I do? From where
do I arrange for so much money?

436
00:56:40,835 --> 00:56:44,247
I believe, Roop Singh never
keeps his money in the bank.

437
00:56:44,838 --> 00:56:47,450
His lifetime earnings
are kept in his safe at home.

438
00:56:47,941 --> 00:56:50,381
It's no difficult task for you
to make the safe key disappear.

439
00:56:50,878 --> 00:56:53,289
- But...
- I give you just 3 months time!

440
00:56:53,881 --> 00:56:58,295
If I don't get the money by then,
the cops will know your secret.

441
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:31,895
Sir, if you don't mind,
then may I ask you something?

442
00:57:31,919 --> 00:57:32,962
What?

443
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:38,067
Who is Khanna, and how did you
get trapped in his clutches?

444
00:57:39,093 --> 00:57:41,037
This dates to
a year and a half back.

445
00:57:41,495 --> 00:57:45,308
Remember Nisha's friend, Shanti,
had come to stay at her place?

446
00:57:45,899 --> 00:57:47,010
I remember very well.

447
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:50,513
In fact, I even remember one
night, when Ms. Nisha fell ill...

448
00:57:50,971 --> 00:57:53,516
you had taken
Ms. Shanti out in your jeep.

449
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:58,354
After that night, we kept meeting
clandestinely every night.

450
00:57:58,946 --> 00:58:02,726
Then one night,
she started sobbing.

451
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:06,429
What's the matter?
Why don't you say something?

452
00:58:07,855 --> 00:58:09,633
I can't hide it any longer.

453
00:58:10,123 --> 00:58:11,267
Hide what?

454
00:58:12,126 --> 00:58:14,838
That we will be
soon facing trouble.

455
00:58:15,362 --> 00:58:16,473
- Trouble?
- Yes.

456
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:18,475
We've got to get married soon.

457
00:58:18,932 --> 00:58:23,480
I know Mr. Roop Singh wants
Nisha to get married to you.

458
00:58:23,938 --> 00:58:26,917
But Nisha is my friend.
I will tell her the truth.

459
00:58:27,374 --> 00:58:28,485
Don't mention it to her!

460
00:58:28,976 --> 00:58:31,087
Why? Do you want to
get married to Nisha?

461
00:58:31,578 --> 00:58:33,290
No, this isn't so.

462
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:38,294
I managed to convince her,
and sent her to Calcutta.

463
00:58:38,919 --> 00:58:41,331
After some days,
I went to Calcutta.

464
00:58:41,955 --> 00:58:44,334
Shanti was staying
at Hotel Imperial.

465
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:47,070
I went to her room at night.

466
00:58:47,961 --> 00:58:52,375
I knew we'd get married
the next day after you arrived.

467
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:56,379
But for how long would
I keep it a secret?

468
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:58,782
I wrote a letter
to Nisha today itself.

469
00:58:59,974 --> 00:59:00,974
- To Nisha?
- Yes.

470
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:05,055
I gave it to the manager a while
back and asked him to post it.

471
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:12,095
- How long back?
- Around an hour back.

472
00:59:14,922 --> 00:59:16,362
- What have you written?
- The truth.

473
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:18,535
She is my friend. How can
I hide anything from her?

474
00:59:19,092 --> 00:59:22,305
I've written about you coming
here, and us getting married.

475
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:28,711
Sohan, what are you doing?!

476
00:59:51,225 --> 00:59:53,637
You're wondering that I arrived
today and am already leaving.

477
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:55,438
I received an urgent telegram.

478
00:59:56,029 --> 01:00:00,143
"What you try and hide,
blood will reveal"

479
01:00:02,035 --> 01:00:03,647
It will be better
if you come inside.

480
01:00:20,521 --> 01:00:21,521
Please sit.

481
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:27,170
Do sit. Don't worry, the police
won't know until morning.

482
01:00:27,628 --> 01:00:29,739
And by then, you will
have returned to Neelgaon.

483
01:00:30,397 --> 01:00:31,875
How do you know I'm from there?

484
01:00:32,332 --> 01:00:35,412
Well, I know
everything about you.

485
01:00:36,136 --> 01:00:40,550
I have the letter which
Ms. Shanti had written to Nisha.

486
01:00:41,141 --> 01:00:44,287
- You do?
- Yes. I forgot to have it posted.

487
01:00:46,347 --> 01:00:50,227
You can give me the letter
and remain silent about it too.

488
01:00:50,684 --> 01:00:52,004
Name your price and I'll give it!

489
01:00:52,686 --> 01:00:55,031
Your wish is my command, sir.

490
01:00:55,522 --> 01:00:56,800
Then, give me the letter.

491
01:00:57,291 --> 01:00:58,835
Its price - Rs.50,000.

492
01:00:59,293 --> 01:01:02,706
- 50,000?
- Yes. Give it in instalments.

493
01:01:03,163 --> 01:01:05,842
Once the payment is done,
I'll give you the letter.

494
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,711
How much do you have right now?

495
01:01:08,302 --> 01:01:09,446
5,000.

496
01:01:10,104 --> 01:01:12,515
No problem. 5,000 will do.

497
01:01:14,441 --> 01:01:15,552
Take this.

498
01:01:16,644 --> 01:01:20,156
But how will I be assured that
the police will never suspect me?

499
01:01:21,148 --> 01:01:22,759
Don't you worry.

500
01:01:23,217 --> 01:01:25,829
You will be relaxing
far away, in your village.

501
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:28,565
And the police will be
tracing some madman!

502
01:01:30,191 --> 01:01:34,604
Since then, Khanna has me trapped
as he has Shanti's letter.

503
01:01:35,195 --> 01:01:38,808
And I am sure he won't give the
letter even after getting 50,000.

504
01:01:39,466 --> 01:01:43,079
Since he knows, I'll be marrying
Nisha and inheriting millions.

505
01:01:43,737 --> 01:01:47,817
It will be better to forget him
for the moment, handle him later.

506
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:50,353
First tell me, when will
you be getting married?

507
01:01:51,245 --> 01:01:54,824
Mr. Singh wants us to get married
next month on her birthday.

508
01:01:55,316 --> 01:01:56,476
I asked him to talk to Nisha.

509
01:01:56,817 --> 01:01:58,862
Forget about talking, sir.
Just get married!

510
01:01:59,319 --> 01:02:01,331
One never knows when
the old man will back out.

511
01:02:02,156 --> 01:02:05,335
The old man won't back out.
It's the girl I'm afraid of.

512
01:02:07,328 --> 01:02:09,773
You're here? You took
so long to change?

513
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:11,374
But where do we have to go?

514
01:02:11,865 --> 01:02:14,778
Just come with me.
You'll forget London and Paris!

515
01:02:15,236 --> 01:02:16,236
Let's go.

516
01:02:17,171 --> 01:02:18,582
Let's go.

517
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:34,898
If people disapprove
of us meeting...

518
01:02:35,456 --> 01:02:38,235
and if I yet want to meet you,
do you know what I'll do?

519
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:39,869
What will you do?

520
01:02:40,327 --> 01:02:41,327
I...

521
01:02:42,997 --> 01:02:46,376
I'll be near this tree and beckon
you. And you come to me then.

522
01:02:47,268 --> 01:02:48,878
You will come to me, won't you?

523
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,653
Tell me, have you seen something
more beautiful than this?

524
01:03:30,277 --> 01:03:31,388
Yes, I have.

525
01:03:31,845 --> 01:03:33,389
You lie! Where have you seen it?

526
01:03:33,847 --> 01:03:35,458
If I turn my face, I can see it.

527
01:03:37,951 --> 01:03:40,071
People who have travelled
overseas are very deceptive.

528
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:44,100
Such beautiful maidens
are even more deceptive.

529
01:03:45,326 --> 01:03:46,770
How have I deceived you?

530
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:48,571
I haven't given you a chance.

531
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:51,207
So, you think I'm
being deceptive towards you?

532
01:03:51,665 --> 01:03:53,076
Why would you bring me here then?

533
01:03:53,534 --> 01:03:54,744
What is your implication?

534
01:03:55,336 --> 01:03:56,856
That your eyes and talks
are deceptive.

535
01:03:57,337 --> 01:03:59,449
And your courtesy is going
to last only for a while.

536
01:03:59,973 --> 01:04:02,493
And I've brought you here because
father wants your signature...

537
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:04,421
on the agreement
of some rotten land?!

538
01:04:04,878 --> 01:04:06,998
0' God! I didn't know,
you thought me to be so amoral!

539
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:13,063
Listen to me, baby.

540
01:04:35,342 --> 01:04:37,721
What's wrong? Have you
sprained your foot?

541
01:04:38,546 --> 01:04:40,357
Don't you touch me!

542
01:04:40,848 --> 01:04:43,159
- It may get swollen.
- It's not your foot!

543
01:04:43,617 --> 01:04:46,563
It certainly isn't but I don't
like anybody's foot swollen.

544
01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:49,466
Who cares what you like
and what you don't!

545
01:04:50,124 --> 01:04:54,537
I swear when you fight,
you look just like a...

546
01:04:55,129 --> 01:04:56,272
A what?

547
01:04:56,797 --> 01:04:58,007
A villager!

548
01:04:58,465 --> 01:05:00,877
Don't you call me a villager!
You are a villager!

549
01:05:14,315 --> 01:05:17,594
What's happened to you? I didn't
know there was a ditch behind.

550
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,931
Please come to your senses!

551
01:05:21,422 --> 01:05:24,367
I promise I will never fight
with you, I'll do as told...

552
01:05:24,859 --> 01:05:26,139
I'll heed everything you say!

553
01:10:14,014 --> 01:10:16,493
I'll serve dinner.
In the meantime, freshen up.

554
01:10:17,685 --> 01:10:20,497
I'll freshen up in a jiffy.

555
01:11:12,706 --> 01:11:14,117
Yes? What is it?

556
01:11:15,009 --> 01:11:17,087
- Is he the one?
- Yes.

557
01:11:17,545 --> 01:11:20,757
Last evening, Ms. Shanti came to
ask for change worth Rs.5,000...

558
01:11:21,248 --> 01:11:23,326
at the reception counter.
I said I didn't have any.

559
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:25,562
This gentleman was seen
near the counter then.

560
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:28,198
He told Ms. Shanti that he
would give her the change.

561
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:31,167
I then saw him go to her room.

562
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:32,903
What's happening?

563
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,571
Do you know her?

564
01:11:35,796 --> 01:11:36,906
No.

565
01:11:37,798 --> 01:11:38,909
Is this your picture?

566
01:11:40,801 --> 01:11:43,213
It was found in
Ms. Shanti's suitcase.

567
01:11:43,804 --> 01:11:46,049
Who is Ms. Shanti? I don't
know any Ms. Shanti...

568
01:11:46,507 --> 01:11:47,918
How much money do you have now?

569
01:11:49,844 --> 01:11:50,987
Money?

570
01:11:52,046 --> 01:11:54,658
I suppose around Rs.200-300.

571
01:11:55,115 --> 01:11:56,660
Can you show it to me?

572
01:12:55,909 --> 01:12:58,522
The testimonies of the accused,
Sundernath, and the witnesses...

573
01:12:58,979 --> 01:13:01,391
proves that on the 15th
night, the accused, Sunder...

574
01:13:01,849 --> 01:13:05,395
was attending his friend
Subodh Mukherjee's marriage...

575
01:13:05,853 --> 01:13:07,831
and was at his friend's
house the entire night.

576
01:13:08,288 --> 01:13:12,435
The court is convinced that he
had no hand in Shanti's murder.

577
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:15,438
And so the court
acquits him-not guilty.

578
01:13:36,317 --> 01:13:38,128
- Don't you want to eat dinner?
- Pardon?

579
01:13:45,926 --> 01:13:47,304
Where did you find this?

580
01:13:47,928 --> 01:13:49,339
In the cupboard.

581
01:14:07,848 --> 01:14:09,593
Whose picture is it?

582
01:14:10,351 --> 01:14:11,461
My sister's.

583
01:14:13,988 --> 01:14:14,988
Sister!

584
01:14:21,095 --> 01:14:23,006
She was my friend.

585
01:14:23,464 --> 01:14:27,310
But we were in the same class
from school until college.

586
01:14:31,105 --> 01:14:35,252
And then? ...
 mean,
how did you get separated?

587
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:37,854
Somebody murdered her.

588
01:14:40,381 --> 01:14:42,359
Murdered her? ...Who?

589
01:14:45,953 --> 01:14:48,565
The incident
occurred in Calcutta.

590
01:14:49,056 --> 01:14:53,603
When I learnt of it, I was
so shocked that I took ill.

591
01:14:54,195 --> 01:14:57,607
The doctor told everybody
not to speak about it.

592
01:14:58,199 --> 01:15:01,611
Even after I improved, everything
was kept a secret from me.

593
01:15:02,069 --> 01:15:04,281
Yet, I learnt of
quite a few things.

594
01:15:05,372 --> 01:15:06,372
What?

595
01:15:06,874 --> 01:15:11,488
That some wretched man
killed Shanti for Rs.5,000.

596
01:15:12,913 --> 01:15:14,691
He was arrested too.

597
01:15:15,182 --> 01:15:17,527
But on the basis
of false testimonies...

598
01:15:17,985 --> 01:15:20,063
the charge was
proved to be untrue.

599
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:24,534
How can that be? ...
 mean
someone else could be the killer.

600
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:26,025
Impossible!

601
01:15:26,961 --> 01:15:31,374
The police report said the killer
had trapped Shanti in his love.

602
01:15:31,966 --> 01:15:34,577
That's why his picture was
found in Shanti's suitcase.

603
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:38,582
And when he was arrested, the
police found the Rs.5,000 too.

604
01:15:39,139 --> 01:15:42,152
And then, there is also the
testimony of the hotel manager.

605
01:15:46,013 --> 01:15:47,624
How could the court
be misled then?

606
01:15:48,082 --> 01:15:49,793
Fake witnesses
and false testimonies!

607
01:15:50,284 --> 01:15:53,363
But the whole world is convinced
that he is the real killer.

608
01:15:53,821 --> 01:15:56,066
The police are investigating
the case again.

609
01:15:56,557 --> 01:16:00,036
I am sure that they will
arrest him again someday.

610
01:16:00,928 --> 01:16:02,688
And this time, he will
not be able to escape.

611
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:05,542
Maybe, the police will apprehend
the real murderer this time.

612
01:16:06,066 --> 01:16:08,545
You talk of the real murderer
again! He is the actual killer!

613
01:16:09,003 --> 01:16:11,548
Neither me nor anybody else
have any doubts about that!

614
01:16:13,941 --> 01:16:15,585
Do you know his name?

615
01:16:16,977 --> 01:16:20,390
If I knew his name and address,
I'd have strangled him to death!

616
01:16:21,982 --> 01:16:24,594
Father is here.
I will go and inform him.

617
01:16:25,052 --> 01:16:28,398
I had promised him that
I'd bring Mr. Popatlal here.

618
01:16:51,078 --> 01:16:52,456
Mr. Roop Singh?

619
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,200
- Yes.
- My name is Popatlal.

620
01:16:54,582 --> 01:16:55,692
- Secretary, say yes.
- Yes.

621
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:57,794
- Secretary said yes.
- Oh! Mr. Popatlal!

622
01:16:58,285 --> 01:16:59,725
- Sohan, he is Mr. Popatlal.
- Hello.

623
01:17:00,754 --> 01:17:03,400
It's good you're here.
I had asked my daughter to...

624
01:17:07,294 --> 01:17:09,406
Nisha, meet Mr. Popatlal.

625
01:17:09,997 --> 01:17:10,997
What!

626
01:17:11,065 --> 01:17:13,109
Mr. Popatlal-the one
whose land we have.

627
01:17:13,801 --> 01:17:15,812
Hoodlum! Hooligan!
I'll break your head!

628
01:17:17,004 --> 01:17:19,116
He's a real cheat!

629
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:24,621
Don't worry. I don't get
offended by what she says.

630
01:17:25,112 --> 01:17:26,723
But you should show her
to a good doctor.

631
01:17:27,181 --> 01:17:28,425
Yes... What!

632
01:17:29,049 --> 01:17:31,661
The doctors in Agra can cure
the worst of mentally ill people.

633
01:17:32,353 --> 01:17:33,463
Get lost!

634
01:17:34,054 --> 01:17:35,254
What's wrong with you, Nisha?!

635
01:17:35,656 --> 01:17:39,135
He is not Popatlal. Mr. Popatlal
has come with me from Darjeeling.

636
01:17:39,593 --> 01:17:40,593
- With you?
- Yes.

637
01:17:40,961 --> 01:17:43,481
Come with me. You'll know who is
genuine and who is an impostor!

638
01:18:03,017 --> 01:18:04,428
Mr. Popatlal.

639
01:18:11,459 --> 01:18:12,469
Mr. Popatlal.

640
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,171
Go on, call him!

641
01:18:16,263 --> 01:18:17,903
Do you believe me now?
Secretary, say yes.

642
01:18:18,332 --> 01:18:19,943
- Yes.
- Secretary said yes.

643
01:19:03,077 --> 01:19:04,187
Hey! Who is it?!

644
01:19:04,645 --> 01:19:06,223
Secretary, behave properly!

645
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,040
Secretary, indeed! People are
waiting downstairs for dinner.

646
01:19:09,283 --> 01:19:10,283
Dinner!

647
01:19:13,087 --> 01:19:14,698
I'll eat chicken!

648
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:18,535
Charlie, we have to
be very cautious.

649
01:19:19,126 --> 01:19:22,539
Chintu, don't worry. I'll
trap the old man in no time!

650
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:25,450
And if you don't, you will
spend your entire youth in jail!

651
01:19:26,133 --> 01:19:27,244
In jail!

652
01:19:27,701 --> 01:19:29,546
If we succeed,
then we'll own millions!

653
01:19:30,404 --> 01:19:31,481
Millions!

654
01:19:32,139 --> 01:19:33,379
And then, we'll share the loot.

655
01:19:34,141 --> 01:19:36,021
I work hard, and you want
me to share the gains!

656
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:44,810
- Secretary, say yes.
- Yes. - Secretary said yes.

657
01:20:07,241 --> 01:20:09,052
You have not taken anything.

658
01:20:10,477 --> 01:20:13,356
Don't worry. I will
surely trace that hoodlum!

659
01:20:13,881 --> 01:20:16,893
And when you find him, bring him
to me. I'll shoot him to pieces!

660
01:20:22,523 --> 01:20:25,902
Mr. Popatlal, how long
do you plan to stay here?

661
01:20:26,827 --> 01:20:29,372
You see... my land
which you possess now

662
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:31,241
You're here to extend its lease?

663
01:20:33,334 --> 01:20:35,645
I want to sell it...
Secretary, say yes.

664
01:20:36,103 --> 01:20:37,447
- Yes.
- Secretary said yes.

665
01:20:37,905 --> 01:20:41,151
Do you want to sell the land?

666
01:20:44,678 --> 01:20:47,958
There's an offer worth 100,000.
Secretary, say yes.

667
01:20:48,449 --> 01:20:49,449
Yes.

668
01:20:49,517 --> 01:20:52,562
But I have the foremost right
over those lands.

669
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,798
You certainly cannot
sell it anybody else.

670
01:20:55,422 --> 01:20:57,342
But I have already given
my word to that planter.

671
01:20:59,426 --> 01:21:01,438
- But I want to give it to him!
- But...

672
01:21:02,296 --> 01:21:04,207
The land belongs to you!

673
01:21:05,299 --> 01:21:06,619
Give 100,000 by tomorrow morning.

674
01:21:06,867 --> 01:21:10,347
Tomorrow morning? ...Well, my
attorney has gone to Darjeeling.

675
01:21:10,938 --> 01:21:14,417
Once he returns after 15 days,
I will have the deeds prepared.

676
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:16,520
How can I wait for a fortnight?!

677
01:21:17,845 --> 01:21:20,924
Come on, Mr. Popatlal!
This is a beautiful place!

678
01:21:21,415 --> 01:21:22,759
You will be taken around.

679
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:25,137
And then, Nisha's birthday
also falls this month.

680
01:21:25,419 --> 01:21:27,464
Oh! Her birthday?
Happy birthday!

681
01:21:28,522 --> 01:21:31,002
It's not just her birthday on
that day but her wedding as well.

682
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:33,003
- Wedding?
- Yes.

683
01:21:33,461 --> 01:21:36,406
She is marrying my friend's son
Mr. Sohan who is also my manager.

684
01:21:36,864 --> 01:21:39,676
I'll have such a grand wedding;
it'll leave everyone spellbound!

685
01:21:43,404 --> 01:21:46,816
She's upset with today's events.
Nothing seems to fascinate her.

686
01:22:08,863 --> 01:22:13,243
Fantastic! The work has begun
again after such a long time.

687
01:22:14,368 --> 01:22:16,479
If you have any problem,
then tell me.

688
01:22:16,937 --> 01:22:17,981
Thank you very much.

689
01:22:18,439 --> 01:22:21,785
Do your work. I'll just
look around and come.

690
01:22:53,674 --> 01:22:57,087
My dear, you have never
hid anything from me.

691
01:22:57,578 --> 01:23:00,690
But today, I feel that you are
hiding something from me.

692
01:23:03,584 --> 01:23:05,795
You don't object
to this marriage, do you?

693
01:23:08,889 --> 01:23:12,035
You are strange, brother. ls
this a question for you to ask?

694
01:23:13,027 --> 01:23:15,038
Fine. You ask her,
and then tell me.

695
01:23:17,431 --> 01:23:22,045
And yes! The Arab businessman
is hosting a party tonight.

696
01:23:22,503 --> 01:23:24,180
He has invited all of us.

697
01:23:24,638 --> 01:23:28,051
Popatlal is a strange character.
He just refuses to come.

698
01:23:28,542 --> 01:23:30,153
And I can't
leave him alone either.

699
01:23:30,611 --> 01:23:33,857
Go with Sohan.
The Arab will be pleased.

700
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:36,293
- I don't want to anywhere today.
- Why not?

701
01:23:36,751 --> 01:23:38,094
I don't feel like.

702
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:40,597
You'll feel better going there.

703
01:23:41,055 --> 01:23:45,635
The Arab's girls sing & dance
well. It will be a grand program.

704
01:23:46,093 --> 01:23:48,305
I said, I don't
want to go anywhere!

705
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:51,942
Fine! Don't go.

706
01:23:58,038 --> 01:23:59,318
Were you madly in love with him?

707
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,819
Love?

708
01:24:05,446 --> 01:24:07,057
Then, why are you mourning?

709
01:24:07,514 --> 01:24:10,560
Mourning? I just
don't care about him!

710
01:24:11,018 --> 01:24:15,499
And whom should I care about?
A cheat, a fraud?!

711
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:18,101
After all, what does
he mean to me?

712
01:24:19,493 --> 01:24:21,638
Are you explaining this
to yourself or to me?

713
01:24:22,129 --> 01:24:23,129
To you!

714
01:24:23,564 --> 01:24:26,109
- I have understood.
- You haven't understood a thing!

715
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:29,112
I haven't gone out all day,
I am not going for the party...

716
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:31,181
so you think that I...

717
01:24:33,774 --> 01:24:37,921
Fine! Tell father that I will
surely go for the party!

718
01:24:38,546 --> 01:24:40,924
I am not feeling sad at all!

719
01:27:13,801 --> 01:27:15,211
Come on, it's your turn now.

720
01:27:32,053 --> 01:27:33,330
I'll recite a verse.

721
01:27:33,788 --> 01:27:37,067
It's not about any particular
person but about the world.

722
01:27:39,693 --> 01:27:44,808
"In this world
of want and craving"

723
01:27:45,266 --> 01:27:50,113
"I've witnessed
many a desires change"

724
01:27:51,706 --> 01:27:57,320
"There's deceit here,
and greed too"

725
01:27:58,746 --> 01:28:03,193
"I've witnessed
one's integrity change"

726
01:28:04,351 --> 01:28:06,029
Fantastic!

727
01:28:08,022 --> 01:28:13,236
"Wealth casts
a spell so enchanting"

728
01:28:13,961 --> 01:28:18,275
"Good it is,
to let this spell torment you"

729
01:28:19,867 --> 01:28:24,781
"The silver coins tinkle"

730
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,084
"Because of it,
I've witnessed people change"

731
01:31:25,953 --> 01:31:27,564
He sang so well.

732
01:32:01,789 --> 01:32:04,935
Excuse me... you know that
we are going to get married.

733
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:07,904
We should try and
understand each other.

734
01:32:08,462 --> 01:32:10,073
Come, let's talk.

735
01:32:10,531 --> 01:32:12,175
This is no time to talk.

736
01:32:27,014 --> 01:32:28,124
Go away!

737
01:32:36,023 --> 01:32:38,668
- I want to talk to you.
- But I don't!

738
01:32:39,193 --> 01:32:41,753
If you didn't want to talk, you
wouldn't have kept the door open.

739
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:46,209
Before you tell me that you hate
me, I want to say two things.

740
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:53,483
You are angry with me because you
think I'm a cheat or a bandit.

741
01:32:54,075 --> 01:32:56,486
Who impersonated Popatlal
to loot your father.

742
01:32:57,111 --> 01:32:58,722
But this is not true.

743
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:03,693
Your father has met me before
and he knows very well who I am.

744
01:33:05,553 --> 01:33:06,863
You are absolutely correct.

745
01:33:07,321 --> 01:33:10,400
I know you,
and that too, very well!

746
01:33:14,028 --> 01:33:18,375
If not for your aged mother,
I'd have had you behind bars now!

747
01:33:21,302 --> 01:33:25,649
Stop staring! If you wish good,
then quietly leave!

748
01:33:30,578 --> 01:33:33,657
The one who is here to stake his
life, will not fear such threats!

749
01:33:35,082 --> 01:33:36,693
I'm here to listen
to your decision.

750
01:33:37,151 --> 01:33:40,197
And only then will I leave.

751
01:33:41,655 --> 01:33:43,700
- What decision?
- About Nisha's life and mine.

752
01:33:44,325 --> 01:33:46,202
How are you concerned
with her life?!

753
01:33:46,694 --> 01:33:49,739
I'm concerned with her life
just the way she is, with mine.

754
01:33:50,197 --> 01:33:52,542
And this dates back to
before Nisha and I were born.

755
01:33:53,133 --> 01:33:55,245
I have already answered
your mother regarding this.

756
01:33:55,703 --> 01:33:58,315
Your answer alone cannot decide
Nisha's life and mine.

757
01:33:58,773 --> 01:33:59,883
- No?
- No.

758
01:34:02,176 --> 01:34:05,355
I can shred you to pieces
for this impertinence.

759
01:34:05,846 --> 01:34:09,660
But I won't because you are not
in your senses, you are crazy!

760
01:34:10,251 --> 01:34:14,164
Just once in a lifetime does
every man feel that he is crazy.

761
01:34:15,055 --> 01:34:17,455
Try and remember that even you
had experienced such a moment.

762
01:34:19,093 --> 01:34:22,706
Even you had fallen in love
with the daughter of a rich man.

763
01:34:23,397 --> 01:34:26,209
Even her father had thought you
were mad, and had threatened you.

764
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:28,712
Yet, both of you had got married.

765
01:34:31,105 --> 01:34:34,718
Believe me, when you were
unemployed at that time...

766
01:34:35,175 --> 01:34:37,521
my mother provided you
shelter, not because you would...

767
01:34:38,145 --> 01:34:40,524
become rich someday but
because your wife was her friend!

768
01:34:41,148 --> 01:34:43,760
If she fixed her son's marriage
with your future daughter...

769
01:34:44,218 --> 01:34:46,830
it wasn't because you would
roll in luxury someday...

770
01:34:47,288 --> 01:34:50,167
but because your wife
meant more than a sister to her!

771
01:34:50,758 --> 01:34:52,569
What do you want to prove
by saying all this?

772
01:34:53,194 --> 01:34:57,140
Even we are going through the
same phase as you once did.

773
01:34:57,698 --> 01:34:59,776
Even we should have the right to
live our lives as per our wish.

774
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:01,760
Just the way you had
once asked somebody the same.

775
01:35:02,269 --> 01:35:05,682
It shouldn't happen only because
two friends had made a promise...

776
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:11,855
but because
Nisha and I love each other.

777
01:35:21,388 --> 01:35:24,234
Perhaps you don't believe me,
but it is the truth.

778
01:35:25,159 --> 01:35:27,337
If it weren't the truth,
Nisha wouldn't remain silent.

779
01:35:29,363 --> 01:35:32,576
We've made our decision.
It's your turn now.

780
01:35:37,838 --> 01:35:42,585
Nisha! If he is speaking the
truth, then I'll never stop you.

781
01:35:44,211 --> 01:35:46,990
You may leave this place
with him right away.

782
01:35:47,514 --> 01:35:52,362
But after that, the doors of this
home will always be shut for you!

783
01:35:53,387 --> 01:35:55,832
I will not see your face
till my last breath!

784
01:36:01,128 --> 01:36:03,373
Come on, smear my face!

785
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:14,140
Come, Nisha.

786
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:21,180
Come on.

787
01:36:25,986 --> 01:36:26,986
Come, Nisha!

788
01:36:40,234 --> 01:36:43,380
You have got your answer.
She will never come with you.

789
01:36:48,008 --> 01:36:52,656
I will never
call you again... never!

790
01:37:24,745 --> 01:37:28,325
Perhaps you're
in a rush, huh? ...Go on.

791
01:37:42,296 --> 01:37:43,707
This will suffice for today.

792
01:39:13,287 --> 01:39:15,687
Nisha has no inkling that I
have invited you from the city...

793
01:39:16,056 --> 01:39:18,602
for her wedding. She will
be very glad to see you. Come on.

794
01:39:26,333 --> 01:39:27,945
Mother! No letter or telegram?

795
01:39:28,402 --> 01:39:30,447
Or I'd have come to
receive you at the station.

796
01:39:30,905 --> 01:39:33,750
You aren't sitting idle,
you are a working man now.

797
01:39:34,342 --> 01:39:35,952
Anyway, I'm glad you're here.

798
01:39:36,444 --> 01:39:37,754
The place seems good.

799
01:41:17,945 --> 01:41:22,726
Do one thing.
Send Sunder to my office.

800
01:41:23,217 --> 01:41:26,796
I'll ask him in private.
He may answer me.

801
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:34,705
Good bye.

802
01:42:07,761 --> 01:42:08,939
A wedding?

803
01:42:13,734 --> 01:42:14,978
This is Nisha's wedding card!

804
01:42:17,071 --> 01:42:18,311
She's getting married tomorrow!

805
01:42:33,621 --> 01:42:36,233
I now know why you are dejected.

806
01:42:36,724 --> 01:42:39,269
Why you suffer from
a loss of appetite!

807
01:42:39,727 --> 01:42:42,038
Why you wake up in the nights!

808
01:42:44,665 --> 01:42:49,079
Luckily, I found out. I'll see
how this marriage takes place!

809
01:42:49,670 --> 01:42:51,110
I'll go to
Mr. Roop Singh right away!

810
01:42:51,672 --> 01:42:55,085
Mother! ...You will
certainly not go there.

811
01:42:55,676 --> 01:42:57,554
- Why not?
- Because I'm asking you not to.

812
01:42:58,045 --> 01:43:01,591
I can't bear to see you hurt.
This time, I'll meet Nisha!

813
01:43:02,149 --> 01:43:04,194
Will you beg her love for me?

814
01:43:04,652 --> 01:43:07,898
And is your son so wretched
that he'll accept her alms?!

815
01:43:08,589 --> 01:43:10,229
I won't ask her for alms
but for my right!

816
01:43:10,691 --> 01:43:12,335
I'll remind her of
her mother's promise!

817
01:43:12,826 --> 01:43:14,871
How will a girl who can't
keep her own promise...

818
01:43:15,329 --> 01:43:17,440
ever bother about her mother's?!

819
01:43:18,632 --> 01:43:19,743
What are you saying!

820
01:43:26,641 --> 01:43:28,451
Have you already met Nisha?

821
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:33,790
And did she also refuse?

822
01:43:37,685 --> 01:43:41,098
I wish she had rejected me
the moment we had met.

823
01:43:42,690 --> 01:43:44,300
But it wasn't so.

824
01:43:44,925 --> 01:43:48,104
I was shown colourful dreams.

825
01:43:49,330 --> 01:43:53,143
And I blindly began to walk on
a path which had no destination.

826
01:43:56,737 --> 01:43:59,550
When I opened my eyes,
I was all alone.

827
01:44:00,607 --> 01:44:03,019
She was gone.

828
01:44:04,645 --> 01:44:08,224
And my love, of which
I was so proud, had perished.

829
01:44:11,652 --> 01:44:17,667
Then... then I realised how
deceptive that innocent face was!

830
01:44:18,692 --> 01:44:22,072
How misleading those
smiling eyes were!

831
01:44:23,264 --> 01:44:26,109
How much venom there was in
that melodious voice of hers!

832
01:44:27,702 --> 01:44:29,813
So many injustices have
been inflicted on you...

833
01:44:30,271 --> 01:44:32,115
and should I yet remain quiet?

834
01:44:32,706 --> 01:44:37,054
This can never be, Sunder!
I will go to Nisha right away!

835
01:44:37,545 --> 01:44:39,022
For what?!

836
01:44:39,513 --> 01:44:42,125
I can't bear to see you
getting torn apart from within!

837
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:44,795
I will ask her to return
your happiness and peace.

838
01:44:45,253 --> 01:44:48,331
That's not in her hands, mother!
It is not!!

839
01:44:49,757 --> 01:44:52,402
This heart has endured
being letdown.

840
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:55,105
It fosters no desire
for anybody now.

841
01:44:55,596 --> 01:44:58,775
All it holds now is hatred!

842
01:45:00,668 --> 01:45:03,108
In spite of all this, if you
still go to that house, then I...

843
01:45:03,804 --> 01:45:05,415
.
 will leave you also!

844
01:45:30,965 --> 01:45:31,965
Excuse me.

845
01:45:40,274 --> 01:45:41,952
I want to tell you something.

846
01:50:49,383 --> 01:50:51,795
Mother was not there. Perhaps
she's gone to the temple.

847
01:50:55,189 --> 01:50:56,800
Your bridal attire.

848
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:02,505
It will be
testing time tomorrow.

849
01:51:03,097 --> 01:51:06,510
On one hand will be Sohan,
on the other will be me.

850
01:51:07,101 --> 01:51:09,712
If you doubt your decision even
for a while, then tell me now.

851
01:51:11,305 --> 01:51:13,149
I will never compel you.

852
01:51:13,607 --> 01:51:15,527
I will not speak about
my broken heart and tears.

853
01:51:16,110 --> 01:51:18,388
Nisha, even if you become mine,
out of pity...

854
01:51:18,879 --> 01:51:21,491
it will not be a victory
for our love but a defeat.

855
01:51:21,949 --> 01:51:23,560
And I will never be
able to bear this.

856
01:51:30,157 --> 01:51:34,571
No. I need no answer
or promise from you.

857
01:51:38,199 --> 01:51:39,810
- Yes.
- Come with me.

858
01:51:40,267 --> 01:51:41,267
Let's go.

859
01:51:46,207 --> 01:51:47,317
Thief!

860
01:51:48,208 --> 01:51:49,319
Popatlal is here!

861
01:51:49,777 --> 01:51:51,321
He's here?!
Where are my clothes?

862
01:54:04,445 --> 01:54:05,622
Let's go.

863
01:54:25,299 --> 01:54:27,711
The poor man
is a very nice person.

864
01:54:29,804 --> 01:54:31,714
Just like
my brother... understand?

865
01:54:34,308 --> 01:54:35,419
What's the matter?

866
01:54:35,876 --> 01:54:38,422
The real Popatlal is here. You
impersonated Popatlal for a girl.

867
01:54:38,913 --> 01:54:40,957
And we did the same,
for money... understand?

868
01:54:43,350 --> 01:54:44,561
What's your program now?

869
01:54:46,353 --> 01:54:47,964
I have no clothes or money.

870
01:54:48,422 --> 01:54:51,769
Help your younger brother so that
he can return to Darjeeling.

871
01:54:52,393 --> 01:54:54,553
I'll be indebted to you forever,
brother... understand?

872
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:00,443
- Do one thing.
- What?

873
01:55:00,901 --> 01:55:05,081
Leave the place instantly or I'll
remove the remaining clothes too.

874
01:55:06,274 --> 01:55:07,384
Understand, brother?

875
01:55:11,578 --> 01:55:12,689
Come with me.

876
01:55:18,318 --> 01:55:20,478
I don't have a penny!
Where do I bring the money from?!

877
01:55:20,755 --> 01:55:24,534
Mr. Khanna and you know that. My
duty was to give you this letter.

878
01:55:35,369 --> 01:55:37,981
Don't worry.
This is a hollow threat.

879
01:55:38,439 --> 01:55:41,585
If the law will get to you,
then even Khanna cannot escape.

880
01:55:42,143 --> 01:55:44,988
Because he has falsely testified
and hidden your letter as well.

881
01:55:45,546 --> 01:55:49,659
I know. But I'll be sentenced to
death, and he, for only 2 years!

882
01:55:50,251 --> 01:55:52,796
Just forget him. He'll certainly
not come during the wedding.

883
01:55:53,554 --> 01:55:56,032
Yet, this marriage will not
take place so easily.

884
01:55:56,490 --> 01:55:58,130
If he won't come,
then somebody else will.

885
01:56:00,027 --> 01:56:03,106
Just let him come.
I have my men ready for him.

886
01:56:03,630 --> 01:56:07,344
If I don't make mincemeat
of him, I'll be damned!

887
01:56:08,002 --> 01:56:09,246
And what did Nisha say?

888
01:56:10,338 --> 01:56:13,150
She didn't say a word
but her eyes said it all.

889
01:56:13,941 --> 01:56:16,953
Mother, wait for us
at the hermitage.

890
01:56:18,178 --> 01:56:20,790
When the sun rises tomorrow,
everything will be crystal clear.

891
01:56:22,382 --> 01:56:25,662
Either, I'll have Nisha's
hand in mine, or...

892
01:56:26,387 --> 01:56:28,131
Don't say a word more!

893
01:56:28,589 --> 01:56:32,669
Stop being stubborn. There's
still time. Stop the wedding.

894
01:56:33,427 --> 01:56:35,806
Or you will be disgraced
in front of everybody tomorrow.

895
01:56:36,463 --> 01:56:41,044
You want me to salvage my honour
and ruin my naive girl's life?!

896
01:56:41,502 --> 01:56:43,180
But I am Nisha's father!

897
01:56:43,638 --> 01:56:45,549
You are destroying
your child's happiness...

898
01:56:46,006 --> 01:56:49,653
and yet call yourself
a father! You are an executioner!

899
01:56:50,177 --> 01:56:53,790
If fleeting moments of sorrow
can turn into a lifetime joy...

900
01:56:54,282 --> 01:56:55,962
then I am prepared
to be an executioner!

901
01:56:56,484 --> 01:56:59,095
Listen to me carefully.
Go and tell Nisha that...

902
01:56:59,553 --> 01:57:02,966
the guests and the groom's
people will be here tomorrow.

903
01:57:03,424 --> 01:57:05,034
And she will marry only Sohan.

904
01:57:05,526 --> 01:57:10,407
If that rascal, Sunder, comes
here, then he will be dead meat!

905
01:57:41,895 --> 01:57:45,709
What's this! Why is the bridal
attire and jewellery lying here?

906
01:57:48,102 --> 01:57:49,847
What are all of you doing?!

907
01:57:50,905 --> 01:57:55,319
Pick this platter
and deck her up.

908
01:57:56,911 --> 01:57:58,021
Did you hear me?!

909
01:57:58,612 --> 01:58:00,412
I will certainly not
take this platter to her!

910
01:58:29,877 --> 01:58:34,491
There's no henna applied on your
hands nor is your hair done up.

911
01:58:34,982 --> 01:58:37,293
And neither has
anybody decked you.

912
01:58:43,924 --> 01:58:46,570
If your mother
were alive today...

913
01:58:47,028 --> 01:58:51,141

 wouldn't have felt
so lonely and helpless.

914
01:58:51,966 --> 01:58:56,579
The world would turn upside down
but she wouldn't have left me.

915
01:58:58,973 --> 01:59:04,654
And she, herself, would have
dressed you in the bridal attire.

916
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:06,856
A bridal attire or a shroud?

917
01:59:11,886 --> 01:59:14,297
You are right, my dear.

918
01:59:15,222 --> 01:59:20,337
If you wear this and come down,
it will remain a bridal attire.

919
01:59:21,162 --> 01:59:26,209
If you return it, I'll think that
I stitched a shroud for myself!

920
01:59:45,486 --> 01:59:51,935
If you return it, I'll think that
I stitched a shroud for myself!

921
02:00:10,043 --> 02:00:14,458
The honour of my love lies
in your hands, don't malign it.

922
02:00:17,084 --> 02:00:18,194
Don't malign my love.

923
02:00:20,087 --> 02:00:23,700
Don't malign my love.

924
02:00:25,626 --> 02:00:30,240
- I stitched a shroud!
- Don't malign my love.

925
02:00:50,184 --> 02:00:52,429
Stop! If you move ahead,
I'll shoot you!

926
02:00:55,189 --> 02:00:56,599
Wait! ...
 said, wait!

927
02:01:17,311 --> 02:01:19,222
What's wrong, uncle?
Who is this man?

928
02:01:19,713 --> 02:01:23,159
He won't heed this way! If you
permit, then I'll tackle him!

929
02:01:25,152 --> 02:01:29,566
Sunder! One gesture from me,
and you can be blown to pieces!

930
02:01:30,157 --> 02:01:33,303
But I don't want blood to flow
on this auspicious day.

931
02:01:33,761 --> 02:01:36,506
It's in your good
to return right away!

932
02:01:38,699 --> 02:01:39,699
Did you hear me?!

933
02:01:41,435 --> 02:01:44,814
I'm not proud of
stepping at your doorstep.

934
02:01:45,272 --> 02:01:47,584
If it wasn't a custom for the boy
to come to the bride's place...

935
02:01:47,608 --> 02:01:49,219

 would have never stepped here.

936
02:01:50,211 --> 02:01:53,390
Shameless man! Perhaps you
don't value your life!

937
02:01:53,914 --> 02:01:56,560
If I didn't value my life, I
wouldn't be here to face death.

938
02:01:57,051 --> 02:01:59,029
Don't try my patience,
I'll kill you!

939
02:01:59,486 --> 02:02:02,732
You may fire bullets at me, your
friends may shred me into pieces!

940
02:02:03,324 --> 02:02:06,236
These vile dogs, living off you,
may tear me apart! Right?!

941
02:02:07,661 --> 02:02:10,273
Don't threaten me!
Look carefully!

942
02:02:10,731 --> 02:02:13,210
This rifle will not
reflect my death.

943
02:02:13,667 --> 02:02:17,581
Instead, you will see your
arrogance and vanity in it!

944
02:02:19,173 --> 02:02:21,533
It's not a combat between your
strength and my helplessness!

945
02:02:22,042 --> 02:02:25,589
It's a test of truth, principles
and of love that will never die.

946
02:02:26,214 --> 02:02:27,494
The love that you want to crush!

947
02:02:28,215 --> 02:02:32,295
It's a duel to decide whether
we have the right...

948
02:02:32,786 --> 02:02:35,132
to make or break our lives
or if people like you do!

949
02:02:37,024 --> 02:02:40,036
You are vain about your strength,
and we have faith in our love.

950
02:02:40,528 --> 02:02:41,838
Pick your rifle and shoot me.

951
02:02:42,330 --> 02:02:45,875
But do remember that if the love
between two people is true...

952
02:02:46,333 --> 02:02:48,078
if two hearts crave to meet...

953
02:02:48,535 --> 02:02:51,682
then, let alone you, even God
cannot be a barrier between them.

954
02:02:57,778 --> 02:03:01,925
You've made similar challenges
of love before but were beaten.

955
02:03:02,483 --> 02:03:05,762
But that was the
first step to success.

956
02:03:06,987 --> 02:03:08,799
The first victory of love.

957
02:03:09,256 --> 02:03:13,136
And today... today,
my destination lies before me.

958
02:04:31,305 --> 02:04:34,918
Catch Nisha
and thrash that rascal!

959
02:04:37,044 --> 02:04:38,044
Beware!

960
02:05:32,499 --> 02:05:33,577
Wait!

961
02:05:35,369 --> 02:05:38,348
Before you get them married...

962
02:05:38,806 --> 02:05:40,650

 want to tell
this naive girl something.

963
02:05:45,412 --> 02:05:48,192
My dear, I am
a stranger for you.

964
02:05:48,682 --> 02:05:51,027
And I have no right
to advise you.

965
02:05:51,485 --> 02:05:55,032
But before bestowing your
happiness on him, do realise...

966
02:05:55,490 --> 02:05:58,235
that you are not his
first wife but his second!

967
02:06:01,328 --> 02:06:03,528
Nisha, please don't heed him.
This is an outrageous lie!

968
02:06:03,898 --> 02:06:08,145
It is as true as the fact that
we are looking at each other now!

969
02:06:09,336 --> 02:06:12,682
She too had become a bride just
like you, wearing a white sari.

970
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:14,751
And that sari became
a shroud for her!

971
02:06:16,344 --> 02:06:18,555
And do you know what that
unfortunate girl's name was?

972
02:06:19,046 --> 02:06:20,390
Her name was Shanti.

973
02:06:22,383 --> 02:06:25,329
You are lying!
What proof do you have?

974
02:06:25,886 --> 02:06:27,798
Come with me, I'll show it
to you right away.

975
02:06:36,630 --> 02:06:38,542
If you haven't
seen it, then look!

976
02:06:46,173 --> 02:06:50,053
He is the one who had
stabbed Shanti to death.

977
02:06:50,511 --> 02:06:52,155
For a mere Rs.5,000!

978
02:06:53,681 --> 02:06:56,059
He is the criminal who
produced fake witnesses...

979
02:06:56,551 --> 02:06:59,830
and false testimonies,
and deceived the court!

980
02:07:00,354 --> 02:07:02,766
But the murder of an innocent
person does not go a waste.

981
02:07:03,357 --> 02:07:06,002
The long arm of the law encircles
every criminal's neck!

982
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:08,772
And this is the outcome
of Shanti's killer too!

983
02:07:12,399 --> 02:07:15,812
This man is an enemy. Please
do not believe a word he says!

984
02:07:16,437 --> 02:07:19,816
The court has acquitted me, since
I had nothing to do with Shanti.

985
02:07:20,408 --> 02:07:21,685
I had never ever met her!

986
02:07:22,409 --> 02:07:24,454
I wish you had never met her!

987
02:07:24,945 --> 02:07:28,025
I wish you had never cast
your evil shadow on her!

988
02:07:28,516 --> 02:07:30,676
I wish she'd seen the vicious
and deadly side of you...

989
02:07:30,951 --> 02:07:32,562
under the facade
of your good looks!

990
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:34,498
But no.

991
02:07:34,956 --> 02:07:38,068
It wasn't so, my dear.
She had to die young.

992
02:07:39,493 --> 02:07:42,539
She is no more.

993
02:07:42,997 --> 02:07:46,309
And today, when you
have become a bride...

994
02:07:46,767 --> 02:07:50,113
the soul of the dead watches
you with a shroud wrapped around.

995
02:07:50,571 --> 02:07:52,115
And pleads before you.

996
02:07:52,573 --> 02:07:57,921
Celebrate, get married and
forget your friend's pleas!

997
02:07:58,545 --> 02:08:00,790
Because a person
becomes blind in love!

998
02:08:01,415 --> 02:08:04,027
But the Lord above is not
blind, deaf or mute.

999
02:08:04,485 --> 02:08:07,831
He will surely provide justice!

1000
02:08:13,460 --> 02:08:14,571
Where are you going, Nisha?

1001
02:08:21,469 --> 02:08:26,083
Believe me, I'm innocent...
I am innocent, Nisha!

1002
02:08:35,516 --> 02:08:36,894
He'll remember it all his life!

1003
02:08:39,921 --> 02:08:41,531
But what proof do you have?

1004
02:08:41,989 --> 02:08:44,134
When I throttle
the hotel manager...

1005
02:08:44,592 --> 02:08:47,192
he'll have to speak the truth
and say who the actual killer is!

1006
02:08:47,761 --> 02:08:51,975
Or I'll surely commit a murder
although I haven't done so, yet!

1007
02:08:52,566 --> 02:08:54,978
- Please listen to me.
- Let go of me.

1008
02:08:55,569 --> 02:08:59,182
Please listen to me.
At least, take an injection.

1009
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:01,618
And then go if you must.
Doctor, please come here.

1010
02:09:15,489 --> 02:09:18,902
Mr. Sardar will go to reach Khanna
to the station tomorrow at 7 a.m.

1011
02:09:19,527 --> 02:09:21,238
There will be just
four men in the jeep.

1012
02:09:21,729 --> 02:09:23,729
Mr. Roop Singh, Khanna and
Khanna's two bodyguards.

1013
02:09:23,831 --> 02:09:26,643
You will be waiting on the way,
armed with your rifles.

1014
02:09:27,101 --> 02:09:30,147
The moment they reach there,
finish off all of them.

1015
02:09:30,604 --> 02:09:32,764
But, Mr. Sohan, the police
will conduct an inquiry too.

1016
02:09:33,474 --> 02:09:37,153
Yes. But they'll have their
suspicions on Sunder, not me.

1017
02:09:37,745 --> 02:09:41,591
Everybody witnessed today
how Khanna dashed Sunder's hopes.

1018
02:09:42,082 --> 02:09:43,322
And Nisha went out of his hand.

1019
02:09:43,650 --> 02:09:47,197
Who else but Sunder can be after
Sardar and Khanna's blood now?

1020
02:09:47,655 --> 02:09:48,865
I understand.

1021
02:11:28,756 --> 02:11:32,402
Please forgive me.

1022
02:11:34,996 --> 02:11:38,408
Sunder, we ought to inform
the police immediately.

1023
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:41,560
Go to the police station
with Mr. Roop Singh.

1024
02:11:41,869 --> 02:11:42,869
And you?

1025
02:11:43,304 --> 02:11:45,616
I have to
settle scores with Sohan.

1026
02:11:53,047 --> 02:11:55,225
- Bad news, Mr. Sohan.
- What happened?

1027
02:11:55,850 --> 02:11:57,970
Sunder reached there with
the Arab and his companions.

1028
02:11:58,486 --> 02:12:00,806
- I did shoot Khanna's men.
- What about Khanna and Sardar?

1029
02:12:00,955 --> 02:12:04,334
Even they are badly injured but
Khanna may have revealed it all.

1030
02:12:04,892 --> 02:12:07,971
Scoot from here. Sunder must
be on his way with the police.

1031
02:12:09,763 --> 02:12:12,375
You wait here... Tiger, get the
jeep... The others, come with me.

1032
02:12:17,271 --> 02:12:18,581
Lock her in the bathroom.

1033
02:12:19,039 --> 02:12:20,039
Leave me!

1034
02:12:20,774 --> 02:12:21,885
Let go of her!

1035
02:12:25,279 --> 02:12:26,279
Come on!

1036
02:12:52,873 --> 02:12:55,385
If we go from the rear side,
they wouldn't know.

1037
02:12:55,876 --> 02:12:57,487
And you can easily
arrest Sohan then.

1038
02:12:57,945 --> 02:12:58,945
Okay.

1039
02:12:59,914 --> 02:13:01,158
Let go of me!

1040
02:14:03,811 --> 02:14:05,656
Wait or I'll shoot you!

1041
02:14:07,348 --> 02:14:09,893
Shooting an unarmed person
is not an act of bravery!

1042
02:14:10,351 --> 02:14:12,151
If you are a man,
then throw this and face me!

1043
02:16:36,030 --> 02:16:38,175
This is enough for today.
