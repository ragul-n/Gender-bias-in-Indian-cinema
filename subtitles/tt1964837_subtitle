1
00:02:38,244 --> 00:02:39,336
Move aside!

2
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,826
calm down. No one can see boss now.

3
00:02:54,894 --> 00:02:56,156
He's being treated.

4
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:58,220
We want to see him!

5
00:02:58,297 --> 00:03:01,130
He must know we are here.
Else, he'll be upset.

6
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,930
Give your name, I will tell him.

7
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:05,195
Kalki from Yeshwantpuram!

8
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:06,363
Manja from Marathhalli!

9
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:10,708
Hello? Matka
chandrappa from Hubli speaking.

10
00:03:10,977 --> 00:03:14,708
How is he? Don't forget
to tell him I'd called.

11
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:25,382
This is our chance. We
must kill him today itself.

12
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,853
He thinks we must obey him.

13
00:03:26,926 --> 00:03:29,793
Entire Bangalore
must Dharma from now on.

14
00:03:29,862 --> 00:03:31,727
Korag Seena. Acid Raja.

15
00:03:32,064 --> 00:03:34,760
Blade Manja.
- Has Dharma from Mysore come?

16
00:03:35,668 --> 00:03:38,068
Has Dharma from Mysore come?
- No, boss.

17
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:43,969
I knew it. That's why I
faked this heart attack.

18
00:03:44,143 --> 00:03:45,235
We don't understand.

19
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:46,938
I always doubted him.

20
00:03:47,747 --> 00:03:53,708
He is an amateur criminal.
He thinks he can challenge me.

21
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:59,917
Our brain will never
function properly if we eat a lot.

22
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:01,317
Take it away.

23
00:04:01,727 --> 00:04:05,094
Boss, I learnt that Dharma's
gang is waiting to avenge us.

24
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:12,102
I knew it. He'll
surely come here tonight.

25
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:16,670
Why?
- To get killed by me.

26
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:23,810
Where is he?

27
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:28,183
Fight me! come on!

28
00:04:28,254 --> 00:04:29,721
I'm here to see you.

29
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:32,155
You planned to kill
me when I'm asleep?

30
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:34,857
Yes! I'm here to kill you.

31
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:48,635
Armugam, a rowdy who
controls the entire Bangalore.

32
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:52,901
He'll kill his enemies first.

33
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:57,948
His men will surrender to
the police on behalf of him.

34
00:04:58,117 --> 00:05:00,711
The cops will be
satisfied their job is done.

35
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:03,782
Big Indian government!

36
00:05:03,856 --> 00:05:05,346
Small Karnataka government!

37
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,058
Mini Bangalore government!

38
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,824
Over here,
it is Armugam's government!

39
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:26,034
He'll take a lease on a land
beside a computer company.

40
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:29,809
He'll get a stay order from
court and interrupt their work..

41
00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:31,984
..and he'll threaten them for money.

42
00:05:32,618 --> 00:05:34,347
He's well versed with the law.

43
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,684
..even if the government
changes in the future..

44
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:37,882
..he's too smart to be caught.

45
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:50,201
Greetings!
- Greetings!

46
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:52,269
I don't think you
belong to this village.

47
00:05:52,338 --> 00:05:55,364
We have been praying to this God
for the last three generations.

48
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:58,243
We came to cook and
serve the people.

49
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:05,947
We need the
jewelleries to decorate the idol.

50
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:07,110
What jewelleries do you want?

51
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:08,312
The crown..

52
00:06:10,856 --> 00:06:12,016
come on!

53
00:06:16,662 --> 00:06:19,995
Who are you guys? It is a sin.
You will never prosper.

54
00:06:42,188 --> 00:06:43,280
Take a u-tune.

55
00:06:58,237 --> 00:07:00,205
Whose bike is it? I don't see anyone?

56
00:07:36,142 --> 00:07:38,702
Hail Lord Shiva!

57
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:43,306
Hail Lord Shiva!

58
00:07:43,682 --> 00:07:47,277
Hail Lord Shiva!

59
00:08:20,052 --> 00:08:23,078
Kempe Gowda! Kempe Gowda!

60
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:31,687
Kempe Gowda! Kempe Gowda!

61
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:50,005
Kempe Gowda! Kempe Gowda!

62
00:08:55,387 --> 00:08:58,754
Kempe Gowda! Kempe Gowda!

63
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:21,874
Kempe Gowda! Kempe Gowda!

64
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:23,380
Kempe Gowda! Kempe Gowda!

65
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:25,743
Kempe Gowda! Kempe Gowda!

66
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:30,049
Kempe Gowda! Kempe Gowda!

67
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:45,930
We can forgive those
who steal for hunger..

68
00:09:46,238 --> 00:09:48,206
..but thieves like you
should not be forgiven.

69
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:51,004
Do you know how many fathers
would have committed suicide?

70
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:53,675
How many people would have suffered?

71
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,375
This village has the
protection of God.

72
00:09:57,883 --> 00:10:02,115
Will lord Anjeneya spare you
if steal Goddess's jewelleries?

73
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:04,655
Please don't!
- People like you must die.

74
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:07,654
I'm sorry.

75
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:11,389
Sir! Stop!

76
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:16,262
Sir, it's urgent. Please
drop me to the main road.

77
00:10:17,703 --> 00:10:20,194
Shut up. You think I'll not
make out seeing you coming..

78
00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:25,073
..running towards me and
stopping S.I Pashupathi's vehicle?

79
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:27,806
Are you S.I (sub inspector)? - Not
S.I, I'm a P.c (police constable).

80
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:30,041
My father's name is S. Indrajeet.

81
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:34,848
So used my father's name as my
initial and named myself as S.I.

82
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:37,045
First tell me why
did you come running?

83
00:10:37,323 --> 00:10:38,688
Sir, I'm a thief.

84
00:10:39,258 --> 00:10:42,421
I stole this from the village.
The villagers are after me.

85
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:45,755
So, if you give me a ride to
the main road, I will escape.

86
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:47,961
How dare you?

87
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:51,964
How dare you tell a
policeman that you're a thief?

88
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:54,295
I will thrash you.

89
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:58,366
And drag you to the police
station taking off your clothes.

90
00:10:58,444 --> 00:11:00,878
If I don't get you
beaten up by the villagers..

91
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:04,007
..I don't deserve to
be called Pashupathi.

92
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:07,978
You're scared now?
- I'm not scared.

93
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:10,886
Then why are you crying?
- Sir, until today, I've never..

94
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:12,981
.. taken off my shirt.

95
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:16,355
I don't know how to
take off the shirt.

96
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:18,988
Don't cry. I will teach you.

97
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:20,258
Look here.

98
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:23,259
Now, you take it off.

99
00:11:24,036 --> 00:11:25,833
You taught me how to
take off the shirt.

100
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:29,099
Sir, I don't know how
to take off the pant.

101
00:11:29,174 --> 00:11:34,043
Idiot. Then how do
you go to the bathroom?

102
00:11:36,915 --> 00:11:39,213
Such a painful story.

103
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:42,284
It is very simple. I will teach you.

104
00:11:44,823 --> 00:11:45,915
Now, you take off your pant.

105
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:48,284
Why are you still crying?

106
00:11:50,729 --> 00:11:52,754
Don't tell me you don't know
how to take off the underwear.

107
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:54,856
Sir, you're my savior.

108
00:11:55,034 --> 00:11:56,296
You stole my heart.

109
00:11:57,302 --> 00:11:59,862
I have to present you something.
What do I..?

110
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:07,201
I will teach you how to escape
from people the next time you burgle.

111
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,179
I will teach you how to escape
from people the next time you burgle.

112
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:10,681
Nab him!

113
00:12:10,716 --> 00:12:13,082
You must hide yourself
into the bushes. understand?

114
00:12:13,118 --> 00:12:14,176
Nab him!

115
00:12:14,286 --> 00:12:15,810
You open and close.

116
00:12:16,055 --> 00:12:18,114
You open and close.

117
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:19,381
You open..

118
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,787
You're mistaken, people.

119
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:28,392
I now got it.

120
00:12:29,068 --> 00:12:32,970
Oh, my God. You will not
understand though I explain to you.

121
00:12:33,205 --> 00:12:34,365
Fulfill your wish.

122
00:12:35,941 --> 00:12:37,033
Good morning, sir.

123
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:38,201
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

124
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,638
Why are you hurt?

125
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:41,936
Stop playing the background
music and acting like a fool.

126
00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:43,140
What do I tell you, sir?

127
00:12:43,215 --> 00:12:46,946
As I become emotional the background
music gets started. I can't help.

128
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:48,245
Who are they?

129
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,652
It's a small
misunderstanding between them.

130
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,781
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings, sir.

131
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:57,317
He hit me yesterday. I want to
lodge a complaint against him.

132
00:12:58,163 --> 00:13:02,327
Why did you hit him? - He spoke
ill of my wife when he was drunk.

133
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:04,191
That doesn't mean
you can hit me, right?

134
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:06,794
I will take him to the court.

135
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:08,733
I want to lodge a
complaint against him.

136
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:12,732
You will lodge case anybody?
Now, lodge a complaint against me.

137
00:13:13,145 --> 00:13:14,203
come on.

138
00:13:15,114 --> 00:13:17,173
You will simply lodge a complaint..

139
00:13:17,282 --> 00:13:19,011
..and expect us to take action.

140
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:22,048
You expect me to waste
my time and court's time?

141
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:25,922
You expect him to keep quiet
while you speak ill of his wife!

142
00:13:26,658 --> 00:13:28,751
Sir.. - If it was me, I would
have chopped off your tongue.

143
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,361
I shake hands you both.
- Sir? - Do it.

144
00:13:37,202 --> 00:13:38,294
Okay, sir.
- Hug each other.

145
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,695
Sir?
- Sir? - Do it.

146
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:45,638
Make sure there are no more problems,
be like this forever.

147
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:48,009
Go from here holding each other's
hands. - Okay, sir. - Okay, sir.

148
00:13:50,616 --> 00:13:53,107
Sir, shall I distribute the
F.I.R books in the school?

149
00:13:53,318 --> 00:13:55,286
They will practice maths.
- But why?

150
00:13:55,354 --> 00:13:58,255
If you keep settling
the problems this way..

151
00:13:58,323 --> 00:14:00,655
..what's the use of a police station?

152
00:14:02,761 --> 00:14:08,893
How can I take action against
my own people? - You're right.

153
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:11,796
How will I achieve my goal if
the government decides to close..

154
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,636
..down this police station
since there are very few cases.

155
00:14:15,908 --> 00:14:18,900
But my dream is something else.
- Sir, what's your dream?

156
00:14:19,378 --> 00:14:21,676
My dream was to own a grocery shop.

157
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,278
I joined the police
force because of my father.

158
00:14:24,316 --> 00:14:26,375
I'll expand my shop if
what you say comes true..

159
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:28,945
..I will shut down
father's Mahalaxmi stores..

160
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:31,888
..and reopen it as
Mahalaxmi Grocery store.

161
00:14:32,057 --> 00:14:34,924
You will open a store,
but what will I do?

162
00:14:35,227 --> 00:14:38,856
You will work as a
helper in my store. - Helper?

163
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:42,330
Hail Lord!
- Do it fast. - Yes, sir.

164
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:47,062
Here are you, madam?
- This is not what I asked for.

165
00:14:47,673 --> 00:14:49,868
Never. Sir, wait a minute.

166
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:53,202
Saying you'll change the grocery store
you changed your outfit instead.

167
00:14:53,946 --> 00:14:55,436
Well, my team is
playing a football match..

168
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:56,841
..against the neighboring village.

169
00:14:57,115 --> 00:14:58,343
You look after this station.

170
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,317
Sir, you are neglecting your duties.

171
00:15:00,385 --> 00:15:01,613
We don't have fix working hours.

172
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:03,086
We have to be available at all times.

173
00:15:04,356 --> 00:15:05,948
We have to handle every problem.

174
00:15:06,024 --> 00:15:07,719
All other government
departments have got a day off.

175
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,121
Does a police station close for a
day like government office? - No!

176
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:14,825
So play whenever you can.
- In that case, I will come along.

177
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:16,633
You already had a
football match in the morning.

178
00:15:20,806 --> 00:15:23,104
come o. Darn it.
- Darn it.

179
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:26,001
Where is Kempe Gowda?
- I don't know.

180
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:29,305
Here he comes.

181
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,710
Only ten minutes left.
The scores are equal.

182
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:34,911
What do we do now?

183
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:36,687
I've come. Don't worry.
- Yes.

184
00:15:40,926 --> 00:15:43,292
''Lord Rama.''

185
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:46,361
''Lord Rama.''

186
00:15:46,798 --> 00:15:49,733
''Lord Rama.''

187
00:15:50,002 --> 00:15:53,096
''Lord Rama.''

188
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:54,929
''Lord Rama.''

189
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:56,838
''The fun now begins.''

190
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:01,169
''Lord Rama.''

191
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,975
''The fun now begins.''

192
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:11,951
''You're the incarnation of God.''

193
00:16:12,024 --> 00:16:15,858
''You write your own fate.''

194
00:16:15,927 --> 00:16:18,259
''It is you.''

195
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,788
''Whatever may happen never give in.''

196
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:24,859
''Do not spare the evil.''

197
00:16:24,936 --> 00:16:26,369
''Never back out.''

198
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:28,038
''Don't go back from your words.''

199
00:16:28,106 --> 00:16:31,132
''You're bravo.''

200
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:32,699
''Lord Rama.''

201
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:36,612
''The fun now begins.''

202
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:38,974
''Lord Rama.''

203
00:16:39,084 --> 00:16:41,177
''The fun now begins.''

204
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:53,227
''You're the incarnation of God.''

205
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:59,328
''Lord Rama.''

206
00:16:59,738 --> 00:17:05,734
''Lord Rama.''

207
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,178
''Let's befriend.''

208
00:17:11,249 --> 00:17:12,682
''Lord Rama.''

209
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,983
''Let's give up fight
and live with unity.''

210
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:24,786
''God created us.''

211
00:17:24,863 --> 00:17:27,957
''Face all difficulties.''

212
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:31,059
''Achieve something before you die.''

213
00:17:31,136 --> 00:17:34,299
''You're a bravo.''

214
00:17:34,373 --> 00:17:37,399
''Move in your body.
Shake in your body, Kempa.''

215
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:42,177
''Move in your body.
Rock in your body.''

216
00:17:42,214 --> 00:17:43,875
''Shake in your body, Kempa.''

217
00:17:46,918 --> 00:17:49,910
''Stop rapping and
play the Indian music.''

218
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:51,717
''Lord Rama.''

219
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,348
''The fun now begins.''

''The one who tries to attain
victory is a true warrior.''

227
00:18:56,321 --> 00:18:59,654
''Write your own fate.''

228
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:02,625
''Lord Rama.''

229
00:19:02,694 --> 00:19:04,161
''Lord Rama.''

230
00:19:04,229 --> 00:19:05,924
''The fun now begins.''

231
00:19:05,997 --> 00:19:08,557
''The fun now begins.''

232
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:10,601
''Lord Rama.''

233
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:12,603
''The fun now begins.''

''Lord Rama.''

238
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:37,026
''Lord Rama.''

239
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:56,203
Madam Kavya!
- Hi.

240
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:57,771
Hi.
- chalapathi!

241
00:19:57,816 --> 00:19:58,908
No.

242
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:00,781
Raghupathi.
- No.

243
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:02,984
Janapathi.
- No.

244
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:05,420
Seetapathi.
- Tirupathi.

245
00:20:05,657 --> 00:20:07,181
Oh. Tirupathi.
- Tirupathi.

246
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:09,750
Where is sir?
- Hello. Tirupathi.

247
00:20:09,828 --> 00:20:11,227
Hello, sir.
- Mr. Mahadev.

248
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,022
Well, how are you? Fine.

249
00:20:13,098 --> 00:20:14,360
I'm fine thank you.
- What brings you here?

250
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:16,127
My children wanted to be..

251
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:18,362
..with their
grandparents for sometime.

252
00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:20,364
Kavya, did you bring the language?

253
00:20:20,438 --> 00:20:21,871
Not yet, I'll bring now.

254
00:20:24,042 --> 00:20:26,101
Watch out!
- Why don't you apply brakes?

255
00:20:26,177 --> 00:20:27,303
There is no brake.

256
00:20:27,345 --> 00:20:28,835
I'm riding with great difficulty.
- Bye, mother.

257
00:20:29,748 --> 00:20:31,613
Aren't they going to school anymore?
- What?

258
00:20:31,716 --> 00:20:33,115
Why are they carrying sacks instead?

259
00:20:33,318 --> 00:20:34,876
Do you have potatoes in the sack?
- Are you blind?

260
00:20:34,953 --> 00:20:36,784
It is school bag.
- You carry on. Bye.

261
00:20:36,855 --> 00:20:37,947
Bye.
- Bye, mom.

262
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:39,752
People don't have respect policemen.

263
00:20:39,824 --> 00:20:42,122
Even children as well.
- Pashupathi?

264
00:20:42,193 --> 00:20:43,421
I was right. What is it?

265
00:20:43,662 --> 00:20:46,153
Where did you go the last 2 days?
- None of your business.

266
00:20:46,231 --> 00:20:47,858
I need the accounts by morning.
- Okay, sir.

267
00:20:49,401 --> 00:20:50,868
What happened?
- Hey.

268
00:20:51,102 --> 00:20:52,160
Idiot.

269
00:20:52,804 --> 00:20:53,930
I will kill you.

270
00:20:54,472 --> 00:20:56,337
I wonder why they let
her inside the house.

271
00:20:57,042 --> 00:21:02,173
Sir, are you both planning
to down grade your shop?

272
00:21:02,414 --> 00:21:04,974
May you be ruined.
- Oh no.

273
00:21:05,016 --> 00:21:06,881
How long are you going to
remain a head constable?

274
00:21:07,018 --> 00:21:10,749
What do I say? 8 years and
I'm still a head constable..

275
00:21:10,822 --> 00:21:12,380
..your son became an S.I in 2 years.

276
00:21:12,624 --> 00:21:15,058
My salary is only Rs. 10,000
and your son's salary is 20,000.

277
00:21:15,126 --> 00:21:16,354
He won't even allow us to take bribe.

278
00:21:18,063 --> 00:21:21,260
Why does she always stare at me?

279
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,267
I heard you.
- I see.

280
00:21:23,335 --> 00:21:25,929
I you ill talk about my son..

281
00:21:26,004 --> 00:21:27,972
..I will spike your coffee. Beware.

282
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,768
It is always spikes even
if you don't.

283
00:21:29,841 --> 00:21:31,706
Shut up. - You offer me
milk and you say coffee.

284
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:35,041
Pashupathi, you want to know
why you remain a head constable?

285
00:21:35,113 --> 00:21:37,946
Yes. - call the shop and
ask if the goods had arrived.

286
00:21:41,052 --> 00:21:44,920
I will know if I call. Simple.

287
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:48,753
Hello. Has the goods arrived?
- Yes.

288
00:21:49,928 --> 00:21:51,896
It already arrived.
- What time it arrived?

289
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,359
What time it arrived?
- At 3.30am.

290
00:21:59,337 --> 00:22:00,395
At 3.30am.

291
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:01,936
How many items he received?

292
00:22:04,342 --> 00:22:05,639
This is too much.

293
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,707
How many items?
- Wheat.

294
00:22:07,812 --> 00:22:08,801
Wheat? Rice? Lentil?

295
00:22:14,052 --> 00:22:15,917
Why can't you ask him
everything at one go? - Sister?

296
00:22:15,987 --> 00:22:17,079
Kempu.
- Father?

297
00:22:17,155 --> 00:22:19,749
call the shop and ask if the
goods have arrived! - Take it.

298
00:22:20,191 --> 00:22:21,317
Keep it on the table.

299
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,260
The items arrived in
S.R.S truck in the morning.

300
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:29,826
Lentils, 8 sacks, rice, 22 sacks..

301
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:33,268
..red chilli, 2 sacks,
jaggery, 6 sacks and wheat, 9 sacks.

302
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:38,203
He said you can come to
the shop after your lunch.

303
00:22:38,743 --> 00:22:41,234
I asked you one question
and you made twenty calls.

304
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:43,705
He only made 1 call
and got all the details.

305
00:22:44,249 --> 00:22:48,083
That's why you are
still not promoted.

306
00:22:49,154 --> 00:22:50,746
But there's something missing.

307
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:52,015
Pashupati.
- Sir?

308
00:22:52,157 --> 00:22:53,215
Bring out the accused
from the room..

309
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,349
..must take him to the court.
- Okay, sir.

310
00:22:54,426 --> 00:22:57,190
He has got a prison at home itself.

311
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,597
come out.

312
00:23:00,865 --> 00:23:03,390
You eat and sleep in
a police's house..

313
00:23:03,768 --> 00:23:04,894
..no wonder you are
not afraid of police.

314
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:06,766
Why are you keeping
a criminal at home!

315
00:23:07,372 --> 00:23:09,602
Our police station is not safe
because it's an old building.

316
00:23:10,175 --> 00:23:12,075
That's why I bring
home important cases.

317
00:23:13,078 --> 00:23:16,775
He is a witness for 10 cases
so must be extra cautious.

318
00:23:17,215 --> 00:23:18,375
I'm leaving, dad.
- Okay!

319
00:23:20,118 --> 00:23:23,747
Run!
- Which tiger are they talking about?

320
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:25,221
Are they talking about real tiger?
- Hey.

321
00:23:26,091 --> 00:23:28,025
Seems like a real tiger.
- Real tiger?

322
00:23:28,093 --> 00:23:29,321
Stop. Sir, let's run away.

323
00:23:29,694 --> 00:23:30,786
How can a tiger enter the village?

324
00:23:30,862 --> 00:23:32,989
Probably, here to promote its film.

325
00:23:33,064 --> 00:23:35,328
People are running with fear.

326
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,662
Don't you still believe?

327
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,831
Sir, I saw the tiger.

328
00:23:41,873 --> 00:23:43,238
Tiger! Tiger!

329
00:23:43,308 --> 00:23:45,173
Where did you see the tiger?
- It went this way.

330
00:23:45,844 --> 00:23:46,902
It's gone.

331
00:23:54,252 --> 00:23:57,278
If the tiger's tail is this long..

332
00:23:58,823 --> 00:24:00,814
..wonder how big is it's teeth.

333
00:24:13,071 --> 00:24:16,199
Girl, why are you in this disguise?
- Well..

334
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:19,610
Where are you from?
- I'm from this very same village.

335
00:24:19,778 --> 00:24:20,904
I'm Dorai Swamy's grand daughter.

336
00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:23,004
Does it mean you can do as you like?

337
00:24:23,114 --> 00:24:27,676
I wanted to scare my
cousin sister Mallika..

338
00:24:27,752 --> 00:24:29,845
..but everyone..
- Have you lost it?

339
00:24:30,388 --> 00:24:31,980
What if they had harmed you
thinking it's a real tiger?

340
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:34,115
What would you have
done if I'd shot you?

341
00:24:34,993 --> 00:24:37,928
Idiot. Go back home.

342
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,222
Take out your costume.

343
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:43,926
Go.

344
00:24:45,804 --> 00:24:46,862
Idiot.

345
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:48,735
Why are you upset?

346
00:24:48,807 --> 00:24:51,275
He scolded me so badly.

347
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,409
He slapped me on my right cheek.

348
00:24:53,845 --> 00:24:56,040
I must take avenge him
slapping his left cheek.

349
00:24:56,447 --> 00:24:59,814
What's the matter with you? You
say you want to slap the inspector.

350
00:24:59,851 --> 00:25:01,045
What happened to you?

351
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,384
Tell him.
- He's arrogant because he's a male.

352
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:07,682
I'll teach him a lesson.

353
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:08,915
Where can I find him?

354
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:10,392
Tomorrow is Friday.

355
00:25:10,628 --> 00:25:12,289
And he'll come to
the temple for sure.

356
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:15,592
Madam, there he is.

357
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:19,630
Anyone would close their
eyes while praying to God.

358
00:25:19,804 --> 00:25:21,066
And I will slap him
when he closes his eyes.

359
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,608
Hail Lord Vittala!

360
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,703
Boss?
- Hail Lord Vittala!

361
00:25:28,813 --> 00:25:30,371
Boss?
- What is it?

362
00:25:30,715 --> 00:25:31,875
Are you here to perform prayers?

363
00:25:31,983 --> 00:25:35,316
No. I'm standing in the
queue line to buy popcorn.

364
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:37,013
Is this a theater?

365
00:25:37,088 --> 00:25:39,022
Hail Lord Vittala!

366
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,284
Hail Lord Vittala!

367
00:25:40,358 --> 00:25:41,985
Hail Lord Vittala!

368
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,887
Madam, he has closed
his eyes. Slap him.

369
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,860
Oh God!

370
00:25:49,934 --> 00:25:50,992
Lord Vittala!

371
00:25:52,871 --> 00:25:56,432
Are you slapping yourself?
- Don't you see?

372
00:25:56,674 --> 00:25:58,437
It's unfair.

373
00:25:58,676 --> 00:26:00,268
If you've done wrong slap yourself.

374
00:26:00,311 --> 00:26:02,575
Why did you slap me? It's painful.

375
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:05,241
Have you lost it?
- You didn't slap me?

376
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,352
Madam, it is the right time.

377
00:26:09,587 --> 00:26:13,148
Break his head with this coconut.

378
00:26:13,591 --> 00:26:14,717
charge!

379
00:26:20,832 --> 00:26:22,231
Sir, someone hit me!

380
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,927
Someone is trying to attack me.
- You've mistaken.

381
00:26:24,002 --> 00:26:25,094
Believe me.

382
00:26:26,371 --> 00:26:28,771
Sir, coconut.

383
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,102
I got it for free.

384
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:31,833
Getting impressed with my prayers..

385
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,400
..lord Tirupathi granted this to me.

386
00:26:33,611 --> 00:26:34,908
I will inform the media about it.

387
00:26:35,013 --> 00:26:36,207
I will become popular.

388
00:26:36,314 --> 00:26:37,975
'Believe it or not.'

389
00:26:38,016 --> 00:26:40,007
'coconut granted by God.'

390
00:26:40,084 --> 00:26:42,075
This title will be suitable for film.

391
00:26:42,153 --> 00:26:45,179
The film will become a hit. Producer!

392
00:26:46,624 --> 00:26:48,216
Hey you.

393
00:26:49,627 --> 00:26:50,924
come here.
- Sister.

394
00:26:50,995 --> 00:26:52,860
Go. He's calling you.

395
00:26:56,968 --> 00:26:58,333
I was thinking the whole night.

396
00:26:59,003 --> 00:27:01,904
I felt so bad for hitting a woman.

397
00:27:02,307 --> 00:27:03,569
I thought you were a thief.
I wouldn't have hit..

398
00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:05,666
..if I knew you Were a girl.
I'm sure even your parents..

399
00:27:05,743 --> 00:27:09,042
..have never hit you. So,
I called you here to apologise.

400
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:10,973
I'm sorry.

401
00:27:11,249 --> 00:27:14,309
You can hit me if you
are still mad at me.

402
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:16,386
But don't do it in public,
it's embarrassing..

403
00:27:16,921 --> 00:27:18,149
..for a cop to get hit.

404
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,282
Bye!

405
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,798
Madam, there's only one thing left.

406
00:27:27,865 --> 00:27:29,924
Lord Hanuman's mace.
Shall I bring it?

407
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:31,997
Shut up.
- Did he learn about it?

408
00:27:32,704 --> 00:27:34,831
No, he's a very good guy.

409
00:27:34,906 --> 00:27:36,305
I behaved childishly.

410
00:27:36,741 --> 00:27:38,265
He's responsible for all this.

411
00:27:38,776 --> 00:27:40,710
I'm responsible for it?

412
00:27:41,112 --> 00:27:43,205
come on!

413
00:27:43,314 --> 00:27:44,372
Pass it on!

414
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:49,150
Boss, I'm at the spot.

415
00:27:49,387 --> 00:27:50,820
It will take
half-an-hour for the game to finish.

416
00:27:50,888 --> 00:27:51,980
The boy is still playing.

417
00:27:52,357 --> 00:27:54,257
Hello?
- Is this Venkata Rao?

418
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:56,422
Yes! Who are you!

419
00:27:56,661 --> 00:27:59,858
That's not important. We
are going to kidnap your son.

420
00:28:00,198 --> 00:28:03,690
What are you saying?
- We have not kidnapped him yet.

421
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:05,061
Your so is playing here.

422
00:28:05,136 --> 00:28:06,569
You have 24 hours.

423
00:28:06,771 --> 00:28:08,739
Arrange 45 lakhs immediately.

424
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:11,902
Wait a minute. Don't get tensed.

425
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:15,745
Hello. We only took away his phone.

426
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,245
Don't make us kill your son.

427
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:19,545
Boss, Matka chandrappa had called?
- What did he say?

428
00:28:19,784 --> 00:28:22,184
Near Hubli..
- Hey!

429
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,854
They are building a
big cement factory.

430
00:28:27,925 --> 00:28:30,393
We can get a huge
amount if we interfere.

431
00:28:30,795 --> 00:28:32,319
We can't even manage locally..

432
00:28:32,397 --> 00:28:33,830
..and you want to go out station.

433
00:28:33,898 --> 00:28:35,729
Boss..
- I'll give you Rs. 10 lakhs.

434
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,334
Rs. 10 lakhs?
- Pass the phone to me.

435
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,895
Idiot! Listen to me.

436
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,803
Is money more important
for you than your son?

437
00:28:46,144 --> 00:28:48,305
I know you took a
bribe of Rs. 1 crore..

438
00:28:48,379 --> 00:28:51,678
..singing the document worth 60
lakhs in Rajajingar registrar office.

439
00:28:51,783 --> 00:28:54,809
I'll kill your son if you
don't give me the money I want.

440
00:28:54,886 --> 00:28:57,912
Hang up. This is how
to deal with someone.

441
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:02,082
Hey. - Don't let the
deal go from out hands.

442
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,219
What did Matka chandrappa say?

443
00:29:04,295 --> 00:29:05,557
It's regarding the cement factory.

444
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,621
Have they started the construction?
- No, just the foundation.

445
00:29:07,698 --> 00:29:10,189
Fool. Let them raise
the building first.

446
00:29:10,268 --> 00:29:12,828
If we interfere now, they
will close the foundation..

447
00:29:12,904 --> 00:29:14,166
..and secretly sell the land.

448
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,704
Let the basement become strong first.

449
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:20,069
Then, we will go and
weaken the building.

450
00:29:20,678 --> 00:29:22,043
Where is the place?
- Rona!

451
00:29:22,747 --> 00:29:23,839
Rona?

452
00:29:30,588 --> 00:29:32,146
The deal is over. Leave the place.
- Okay!

453
00:29:35,326 --> 00:29:37,317
Why did you use a gun in public?

454
00:29:37,662 --> 00:29:38,890
I've handled so many deals.

455
00:29:38,963 --> 00:29:41,227
Even my wife doesn't
know what I'm doing.

456
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:43,031
No one will help us in kidnapping..

457
00:29:43,101 --> 00:29:47,162
..as how they help in other matters.
- Brother!

458
00:29:47,238 --> 00:29:50,230
I only target rich families so
that they'll pay the ransom.

459
00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:53,600
Wait until the hen lay the eggs.

460
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:57,613
Don't force it. Else, it
will die. Remember that.

461
00:29:59,817 --> 00:30:01,182
Push! come on!

462
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:02,681
Wait a minute!

463
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:08,349
Seeing the bush shaking..

464
00:30:08,426 --> 00:30:10,894
..I guess there are
two wild fighting inside.

465
00:30:10,962 --> 00:30:14,659
I think I will get promotion
only if I capture a wild animal.

466
00:30:14,732 --> 00:30:16,859
Sir, don't. It is dangerous.

467
00:30:17,301 --> 00:30:19,428
I will do anything for promotion.

468
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,069
I will capture it.

469
00:30:21,706 --> 00:30:23,936
I hear a song.

470
00:30:24,775 --> 00:30:27,403
''come closer, darling.''

471
00:30:27,745 --> 00:30:28,837
come on!

472
00:30:28,946 --> 00:30:30,641
Get inside!

473
00:30:31,349 --> 00:30:33,840
I will teach you now.
- Sir, What happened?

474
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:36,682
Shut up. It is the
matter of my dignity.

475
00:30:36,754 --> 00:30:37,982
No one interfere.

476
00:30:38,055 --> 00:30:39,420
It is sir's order.
- Yes.

477
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:42,949
Sir? - I will wear my
uniform and teach you.

478
00:30:43,127 --> 00:30:44,890
How dare they commit
such an offense?

479
00:30:44,962 --> 00:30:47,089
They don't fear the police.

480
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:54,002
Hey. What hare you doing?
- Wait a minute, sir.

481
00:30:54,205 --> 00:30:56,264
What? Idiot. Get up.

482
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,035
Who closed the door? Open it.

483
00:30:58,109 --> 00:31:00,202
come here. Why didn't you stop them?

484
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:01,973
Sir, you who told us
not to interfere.

485
00:31:02,113 --> 00:31:04,172
Hey. come out!
- Wait a minute, sir.

486
00:31:04,382 --> 00:31:05,576
You want more time?

487
00:31:06,784 --> 00:31:08,376
come out! come out!

488
00:31:08,953 --> 00:31:10,386
What were you doing inside? Tell me!

489
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:11,952
Don't you know, sir?

490
00:31:12,023 --> 00:31:14,287
Is he out of his mind?

491
00:31:14,358 --> 00:31:17,623
Sir, the song was fantastic.
I fell asleep.

492
00:31:18,296 --> 00:31:19,320
Take the money.

493
00:31:19,397 --> 00:31:21,058
Had I booked for a room it
would've cost me Rs. 1000.

494
00:31:21,732 --> 00:31:23,324
And if there was a police
raid we had to pay Rs. 2000.

495
00:31:23,668 --> 00:31:25,966
Thank you so much
for cooperating, sir.

496
00:31:27,138 --> 00:31:29,368
S.I would've killed me had
he come to know about it.

497
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,135
Hey. Leave before I get angry.

498
00:31:31,242 --> 00:31:34,837
Get away!
- Madam, can we visit again?

499
00:31:42,286 --> 00:31:44,117
Grandma, my chain is missing.
- What?

500
00:31:44,188 --> 00:31:46,179
Don't worry. It's only a silver chain.

501
00:31:47,258 --> 00:31:49,783
It's not silver, but platinum.

502
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,021
It'd diamond a pendant.

503
00:31:52,096 --> 00:31:53,757
It was worth 4 lakhs.

504
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:56,356
You were using a chain worth
4 acres of coconut plantation!

505
00:31:56,434 --> 00:31:59,062
Be quiet.
- Listen. - Sir?

506
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:05,268
Ask our men to search
everywhere for the chain.

507
00:32:06,744 --> 00:32:09,713
Please come.
- What's the matter, Tiru?

508
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,906
This is his house.
- Greetings.

509
00:32:10,982 --> 00:32:13,177
Who is she?
- My boss's granddaughters.

510
00:32:13,284 --> 00:32:15,309
She wanted to meet Mr. Kenpe Gowda.

511
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:17,616
So, I brought her here.

512
00:32:17,688 --> 00:32:20,156
Is she the ones from town!
- Yes!

513
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:21,817
Kempu!
- Yes?

514
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:24,190
Someone is here to see you.

515
00:32:25,796 --> 00:32:28,128
What brings you here?

516
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:30,258
You want to hit me in my house?

517
00:32:30,334 --> 00:32:32,325
No. I came to lodge a complaint.

518
00:32:32,403 --> 00:32:33,870
The girl is very beautiful.

519
00:32:33,938 --> 00:32:36,634
It'll be nice if we
get her married to Kempu.

520
00:32:37,141 --> 00:32:39,735
How did it go missing?
- I don't know.

521
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:41,411
When was the last you saw it?

522
00:32:41,746 --> 00:32:43,213
Yesterday night before dinner.

523
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:44,706
How do you remember it?

524
00:32:44,815 --> 00:32:47,875
It might sound cheap if I tell you.
- cheap?

525
00:32:47,952 --> 00:32:53,390
We've a habit of looking
at our face in the plate.

526
00:32:53,658 --> 00:32:56,889
That's how I remember.

527
00:32:57,762 --> 00:33:02,096
Do you suffer from sleepwalk?
- Are you kidding?

528
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:04,897
You must answer if a
police questions you.

529
00:33:05,336 --> 00:33:06,598
It's nothing like that.

530
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:09,162
What did you wear last night?
- Nightgown.

531
00:33:09,307 --> 00:33:13,300
Do you take it off
like a shirt or a T-shirt?

532
00:33:13,377 --> 00:33:16,073
Why do you ask all this?
- Just answer me.

533
00:33:16,781 --> 00:33:17,907
Like this.

534
00:33:17,982 --> 00:33:20,177
It must be stuck in the
hook of your nightgown.

535
00:33:20,217 --> 00:33:21,616
Go and check.

536
00:33:23,854 --> 00:33:26,880
He sounded vulgar questioning
you about your nightgown.

537
00:33:26,957 --> 00:33:28,288
And you answered him without shame.

538
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:31,260
It says it could be stuck
in the hook.

539
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:33,263
He wants to prove he's smart.

540
00:33:33,331 --> 00:33:34,730
Let's go and check.

541
00:33:48,012 --> 00:33:50,913
My phone is missing.
I want to lodge a complaint.

542
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:53,242
Why do you keep
losing your belongings?

543
00:33:53,651 --> 00:33:54,811
Where did you leave it?

544
00:33:55,219 --> 00:33:57,084
I spoke to my mom before sleeping.

545
00:33:57,154 --> 00:33:58,644
Today morning it's missing.

546
00:33:59,223 --> 00:34:01,919
Do you have a habit of
throwing things in sleep?

547
00:34:01,992 --> 00:34:03,220
Nothing like that.

548
00:34:03,294 --> 00:34:05,319
Sir?
- Who was sleeping beside you?

549
00:34:05,763 --> 00:34:07,128
She's the one.

550
00:34:07,365 --> 00:34:09,265
Are you suspecting me?

551
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,801
I have my latest cute phone.

552
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:17,099
Where did you leave it?

553
00:34:17,174 --> 00:34:18,903
At the table beside the bed.

554
00:34:19,677 --> 00:34:21,975
How far is the table from the window?
- I idea.

555
00:34:22,012 --> 00:34:23,673
Was the window opened or closed?

556
00:34:23,714 --> 00:34:25,705
It's an air conditioned room.
Of course, it'll be closed.

557
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:27,648
You're right. It is summer days.

558
00:34:28,886 --> 00:34:30,217
The window was closed in the night.

559
00:34:30,287 --> 00:34:31,652
You kept it on the table.

560
00:34:31,722 --> 00:34:33,383
And you used it before sleeping.
Morning it goes missing.

561
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,753
Definitely you put it somewhere.
- What do you mean?

562
00:34:37,395 --> 00:34:39,761
May be you misplaced it.

563
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,889
It might be in silent
mode as well. Search again.

564
00:34:42,366 --> 00:34:43,958
If you give me your number..

565
00:34:44,034 --> 00:34:46,628
..I'll let you know
whether or not I found the phone.

566
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:48,739
call 100 and they'll
connect you to the station.

567
00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:51,639
Sister, it was an
old phone. Let it be.

568
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:52,971
Hello, Tigress.

569
00:34:54,145 --> 00:34:57,114
Do you want sir's number?
- No.

570
00:34:58,015 --> 00:35:01,610
What's her problem?
- You! - I want it.

571
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:04,582
I knew it.

572
00:35:04,655 --> 00:35:07,317
100 please.
- He said the same.

573
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:10,753
Both are different from each other.

574
00:35:10,995 --> 00:35:12,053
You didn't understand?

575
00:35:12,129 --> 00:35:14,620
Give me. Thank you.

576
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:17,794
Only Rs. 50?
- 50 percent discount.

577
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:19,665
You're very smart. Note it down.

578
00:35:19,737 --> 00:35:23,798
Tell me.
- 98457. Bye.

579
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:26,035
What about the rest?
- 50 percent discount.

580
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,271
That's all.
- Wait.

581
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:32,073
Thank you. 77726.
Don't you want my number?

582
00:35:32,116 --> 00:35:33,310
Nonsense.

583
00:35:36,387 --> 00:35:39,618
Why don't you cut your hair?
Idiot. What is it?

584
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,215
Someone stole my
earrings while I was bathing.

585
00:35:42,293 --> 00:35:44,056
Your earrings are missing?

586
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:45,618
I will use sir's idea.

587
00:35:45,696 --> 00:35:52,693
Do you take off your
nightgown like a T-shirt or a shirt?

588
00:35:52,937 --> 00:35:55,735
This way. Is this how
you talk to a woman?

589
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:58,340
I will thrash you. Idiot.

590
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,176
Sir asked the same
question and it did work..

591
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:03,570
..but I got thrashed. Why?

592
00:36:03,647 --> 00:36:05,740
Who would hide their own phone?

593
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,841
He's talking nonsense.

594
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:11,854
He's right, but I'm wrong.
- What are you saying?

595
00:36:12,356 --> 00:36:16,224
I gave my phone to
Titupathi to hide it.- Why?

596
00:36:17,027 --> 00:36:19,018
You've heard the tale of the
lion capturing the tiger's tail..

597
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:20,154
..it did not capture the tail.

598
00:36:20,231 --> 00:36:23,166
Then! Did he capture the leg?
- No.

599
00:36:23,634 --> 00:36:26,364
I developed feeling for him
when he embraced me the other day.

600
00:36:26,637 --> 00:36:28,764
Sister, you have fallen for him.

601
00:36:34,612 --> 00:36:36,011
Sir, coffee.

602
00:36:41,685 --> 00:36:43,152
Greetings, sir.

603
00:36:43,354 --> 00:36:45,322
You are..
- I stay nearby.

604
00:36:45,823 --> 00:36:47,222
You are building a big house..

605
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:49,054
..is there anything
that I can help you!

606
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:51,024
Please sit.
- Thank you.

607
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,189
There are good people staying nearby.

608
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,130
Where are you from?
- Mysore.

609
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:01,066
But I migrated to America.

610
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:04,230
My children wanted to build
a house in their motherland.

611
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:07,641
So, I'm getting one built for them.

612
00:37:08,078 --> 00:37:12,242
It is half acre. You
must've paid Rs. 50 lakhs.

613
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:18,049
Are you joking? Its 2Y, acres,
Y, acre costs Rs. 1.5 crores.

614
00:37:18,122 --> 00:37:19,851
I paid Rs. 7.5 crores to get it.

615
00:37:19,924 --> 00:37:22,222
That's great.

616
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:28,355
call me if you have
any problems.- Problems?

617
00:37:28,632 --> 00:37:30,031
You will face problem.

618
00:37:30,234 --> 00:37:33,328
Someone might come and
threaten you for money.

619
00:37:33,637 --> 00:37:35,662
How is it possible?

620
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:38,938
He'll definitely come.

621
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,605
Who will come?

622
00:37:43,614 --> 00:37:45,809
He'll definitely come.
- Who will come?

623
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:48,113
Armugam.

624
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,983
I'll ask you for money.

625
00:37:53,757 --> 00:37:55,384
Why are you talking like this?

626
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:59,962
Give me Rs. 50 lakhs.

627
00:38:00,264 --> 00:38:04,894
I'll not come to you.
Nor I will trouble you.

628
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:07,802
I'll report to the police.

629
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:12,697
I will call the Revenue
and Income tax department.

630
00:38:12,776 --> 00:38:16,268
I've recorded
whatever you said earlier.

631
00:38:16,947 --> 00:38:19,279
This document shows that
you bought this place..

632
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,677
..for just Rs 2 crores.

633
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:24,217
Your name and image
will be tarnished if the..

634
00:38:24,288 --> 00:38:27,121
..Revenue department
finds out this matter.

635
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:29,955
The news about you will be
published in the newspaper.

636
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,597
You'll end up in jail even
after paying a fine of 20 percent.

637
00:38:35,032 --> 00:38:37,592
If you insist on going to
jail rather than paying us..

638
00:38:37,668 --> 00:38:39,192
..there will be two murders..

639
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:41,999
..a girl will run out naked
shouting you molested her.

640
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:44,199
Do you need all this at this age?

641
00:38:44,274 --> 00:38:47,004
Before you drink hot
coffee in the morning..

642
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:48,203
..read the newspaper.

643
00:39:00,691 --> 00:39:05,185
My dear son, a person
named Armugam is troubling me.

644
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:08,129
So, I'm forced to take this decision.

645
00:39:12,169 --> 00:39:15,195
The last I came here
was 30 years back..

646
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:18,764
..with your grandmother to
watch film 'Bangarada Manushya'.

647
00:39:18,842 --> 00:39:21,140
You all wait here,
I will buy the tickets.

648
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:24,937
Weighing machine.
Give me 1 rupee coin.

649
00:39:25,149 --> 00:39:28,915
You need to remove your footwear.
- Okay.

650
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:35,022
Darling, It'll be better
if you remove your clothes.

651
00:39:35,726 --> 00:39:40,595
Idiot! Is that how you talk to women?

652
00:39:40,731 --> 00:39:45,100
Old man! How dare you hold my collar?

653
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:47,260
You want to fight me? Get away!

654
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:50,606
How dare you push him?

655
00:39:50,674 --> 00:39:52,904
How dare you hold my collar?

656
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:57,604
My men will chop you off if
they find out what happened.

657
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,176
How dare you touch her?

658
00:40:00,217 --> 00:40:03,345
Bring your men. Let's go.

659
00:40:05,823 --> 00:40:09,725
Aren't you ashamed
sparing the one who..

660
00:40:09,793 --> 00:40:12,853
..misbehaved with my granddaughter?

661
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,330
I will not let go of this.

662
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:18,267
Who are you calling?
- Your father.

663
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:20,132
Let him come and kill them.

664
00:40:20,204 --> 00:40:23,640
Father will never send us
here again if he finds out.

665
00:40:23,707 --> 00:40:27,837
Then, tell me what do I do?
- Please don't.

666
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:30,809
Tell me what happened?

667
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:32,705
Why are you crying?

668
00:40:32,816 --> 00:40:34,909
I took my
granddaughters to the theatre.

669
00:40:36,053 --> 00:40:38,783
Goons there harassed my granddaughter.

670
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:50,657
Has the movie finished?
- It'll finish in 10 minutes.

671
00:40:50,734 --> 00:40:52,429
close the gates. No one
should leave this place.

672
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:04,578
Who's the culprit who
misbehaved with her?

673
00:41:05,616 --> 00:41:11,145
Who's the culprit?
come forward if you dare.

674
00:41:11,321 --> 00:41:12,618
come to Shankar theatre.
- come on!

675
00:41:12,689 --> 00:41:14,156
Why stop us for your personal problem?

676
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:16,658
Why can't you wait? Tell me?

677
00:41:16,994 --> 00:41:20,225
Will you do the same
if it was your sister?

678
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:21,628
You could watch
movie for three hours..

679
00:41:21,698 --> 00:41:22,858
..but can't wait for three minutes.

680
00:41:22,933 --> 00:41:25,231
You're shouting because
you are a cop and own a gun.

681
00:41:25,302 --> 00:41:27,668
Leave it aside, then
we'll show you who we are.

682
00:41:27,771 --> 00:41:28,999
Who's that?

683
00:41:30,174 --> 00:41:31,903
Who's that?

684
00:41:39,116 --> 00:41:43,212
I'm not a cop now.
I took off my uniform.

685
00:41:43,887 --> 00:41:45,650
come out!

686
00:42:16,687 --> 00:42:18,211
Kempe Gowda!

687
00:42:18,722 --> 00:42:20,690
Kempe Gowda!

688
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:26,723
Kempe Gowda!

689
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,793
Kempe Gowda!

690
00:43:12,776 --> 00:43:14,107
Run!

691
00:43:19,816 --> 00:43:21,249
Kempe Gowda!

692
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:23,084
Kempe Gowda!

693
00:43:23,387 --> 00:43:25,287
Kempe Gowda!

694
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:28,881
Kempe Gowda!

695
00:43:29,226 --> 00:43:30,887
Kempe Gowda!

696
00:43:31,228 --> 00:43:33,253
Kempe Gowda!

697
00:44:05,796 --> 00:44:07,730
How dare you touch a girl?

698
00:44:07,798 --> 00:44:09,993
Sir, please spare me!

699
00:44:26,183 --> 00:44:29,346
Will a cop keep quiet if
someone harasses his wife?

700
00:44:47,137 --> 00:44:51,801
''I'm 18 years old now.''

701
00:44:52,242 --> 00:44:56,645
''A kind sweet feeling
has developed in me.''

702
00:44:56,847 --> 00:44:58,405
''My man.''

703
00:44:58,648 --> 00:45:01,310
''You stole my heart
without my knowledge.''

704
00:45:01,818 --> 00:45:03,683
''My man.''

705
00:45:03,754 --> 00:45:06,951
''You stole my heart
without my knowledge.''

706
00:45:09,693 --> 00:45:10,887
What can we do?

707
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:14,328
He e-mailed his son in
uS and committed suicide.

708
00:45:14,598 --> 00:45:17,226
The commissioner is
pressured by the embassy..

709
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,858
..that's why we had to open F.I.R.

710
00:45:18,935 --> 00:45:21,768
What are you all for then?
- Don't get tensed up.

711
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:23,328
You are only being accused..

712
00:45:23,607 --> 00:45:25,973
..you'll definitely get bail.
- Shut up!

713
00:45:26,176 --> 00:45:27,768
call the minister.

714
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:30,075
Why are you making it a big issue?

715
00:45:30,113 --> 00:45:31,774
We've prepared so
that no one will know..

716
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:33,282
..that you have been arrested.

717
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:35,682
What are you..?
- This is N.R.I matter.

718
00:45:35,752 --> 00:45:38,277
If this become an issue the central
get involved and there will c.B.I.

719
00:45:38,622 --> 00:45:40,385
If that happens, we'll
not be able to do anything.

720
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:42,648
I've never been
arrested in the past 12 years.

721
00:45:42,726 --> 00:45:44,717
Please..
- This is just a formality.

722
00:45:44,795 --> 00:45:49,664
We'll get you bail before
you are remanded. Trust us.

723
00:45:51,635 --> 00:45:52,761
Darn it.

724
00:45:54,871 --> 00:45:57,635
It's done but only on condition bail.

725
00:45:57,808 --> 00:46:00,743
You've to sign your
attendance for 15 days..

726
00:46:00,777 --> 00:46:01,869
..in Rona police station.

727
00:46:01,978 --> 00:46:05,573
Take it. - Rona?
It is in Andhra Pradesh, right?

728
00:46:05,649 --> 00:46:08,641
Vaikunta. Dhronachala
is in Andhra Pradesh.

729
00:46:08,952 --> 00:46:10,317
Rona is in Hubli.

730
00:46:10,587 --> 00:46:13,579
Hubli? I'll ask Matka
chandrappa to sign the attendance.

731
00:46:13,657 --> 00:46:16,785
Don't worry.
I'll send my men to sign.

732
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,589
Fax me his signature.

733
00:46:18,662 --> 00:46:19,686
Rona!

734
00:46:28,238 --> 00:46:30,206
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings. Please sit!

735
00:46:30,273 --> 00:46:33,106
You're a police, how
to sit in front of you?

736
00:46:33,176 --> 00:46:35,974
You are like my family. Please sit.

737
00:46:36,012 --> 00:46:40,073
He came there because he loves
your daughter, right? - Yes.

738
00:46:40,117 --> 00:46:42,608
I gave him water to drink.

739
00:46:42,686 --> 00:46:45,086
He stands at the
opposite coffee shop..

740
00:46:45,155 --> 00:46:47,214
..and watches towards our house.

741
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:49,121
I agree with what you say.

742
00:46:49,192 --> 00:46:51,990
Our village girls stay
at home all the time.

743
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:54,087
He came as he loves your daughter.

744
00:46:54,164 --> 00:46:55,995
If you encourage violence yourself..

745
00:46:56,066 --> 00:46:57,897
..who'll advise the youths?

746
00:46:58,034 --> 00:47:00,867
Your son is superb.

747
00:47:01,204 --> 00:47:04,071
After all, he's a police officer.

748
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:06,701
This problem is between two families,
not between two villages.

749
00:47:06,776 --> 00:47:09,267
If they love each other,
get them married.

750
00:47:09,346 --> 00:47:10,836
Else..

751
00:47:14,885 --> 00:47:16,819
If they love each other,
get them married.

752
00:47:16,887 --> 00:47:18,878
No one else should interfere.
understand? - Yes, sir.

753
00:47:18,955 --> 00:47:20,582
You get it?
- Yes.

754
00:47:20,657 --> 00:47:21,885
Everybody?
- Yes, sir.

755
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:24,085
And you. If I see you
at the house again..

756
00:47:24,194 --> 00:47:25,320
..I'll thrash you.
- I won't go.

757
00:47:25,595 --> 00:47:27,119
Both of you. come and shake hands.

758
00:47:27,197 --> 00:47:28,721
Hug each other.

759
00:47:30,634 --> 00:47:31,794
understand, everybody?
- Yes, sir. - All can go now.

760
00:47:31,868 --> 00:47:33,358
We will take your leave.

761
00:47:33,637 --> 00:47:35,798
Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

762
00:47:36,907 --> 00:47:41,367
You made them hug each other
because they are both males.

763
00:47:41,611 --> 00:47:44,580
What would you do if
it's a male and female?

764
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:47,081
I need to check if the
gun is perfect. come on.

765
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:52,319
You might've escaped from him.

766
00:47:52,389 --> 00:47:56,655
One day you will get caught by me.

767
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:58,761
What did you say?

768
00:47:59,696 --> 00:48:01,288
Government encourages to plant trees..

769
00:48:01,565 --> 00:48:03,157
..but you're focused
on growing mustache.

770
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,595
I like the noise that you guys make.

771
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:10,631
Sir, we get tea for free
in that stop.

772
00:48:10,707 --> 00:48:12,072
It is very good.

773
00:48:12,676 --> 00:48:14,667
I said it is good,
I didn't tell you to stop.

774
00:48:14,744 --> 00:48:16,678
I'm not lucky enough
to have free tea.

775
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,748
Sir! Stop!

776
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:20,741
What's the matter?

777
00:48:20,817 --> 00:48:22,808
A thief snatched my bag.

778
00:48:22,886 --> 00:48:25,286
Snatched your bag?
- Yes. Look here.

779
00:48:25,789 --> 00:48:27,279
Hey Mallika, do you know who that is?

780
00:48:27,624 --> 00:48:28,852
I'm severely wounded.

781
00:48:28,925 --> 00:48:31,120
I was not with her. I
met her after she was hurt.

782
00:48:31,962 --> 00:48:35,295
Ask your grandpa to come.
You go home. - Well..

783
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:38,630
You are a grown girl right!

784
00:48:38,835 --> 00:48:41,303
Why are you always hanging out?

785
00:48:42,038 --> 00:48:43,130
Go home.

786
00:48:43,206 --> 00:48:45,037
Stop staring. Go home.
- Go.

787
00:48:47,677 --> 00:48:52,080
Why are you so tensed?
- She's lying.

788
00:48:52,816 --> 00:48:57,219
Lie?
- This was not a thief.

789
00:48:57,921 --> 00:49:00,321
It's scratched with
a thorn, not a knife.

790
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:02,683
She's a good girl..

791
00:49:02,759 --> 00:49:04,920
..wonder why is she doing all this.

792
00:49:05,795 --> 00:49:07,956
Do you have the
number of her lost mobile?

793
00:49:08,265 --> 00:49:09,892
call that number.
- I've saved the number.

794
00:49:12,035 --> 00:49:14,936
''Woman is trouble.''

795
00:49:15,005 --> 00:49:17,997
''It is better..

796
00:49:18,074 --> 00:49:20,565
..to remain as bachelor.''

797
00:49:20,677 --> 00:49:26,240
Hello. The person you have
called is not reachable.

798
00:49:26,349 --> 00:49:29,750
It's not reachable.
- Try again.

799
00:49:29,819 --> 00:49:31,013
Okay, sir.

800
00:49:32,789 --> 00:49:34,950
For this song..

801
00:49:35,025 --> 00:49:38,654
..press star along with red button.

802
00:49:41,931 --> 00:49:43,990
Sir, someone is fooling us.

803
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:46,133
Give me the phone.

804
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,198
Subscriber is busy in Sri Lanka.

805
00:49:54,911 --> 00:49:57,209
This is Tirupathi's voice.
- Is it?

806
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,104
I know where we can find him.

807
00:50:01,851 --> 00:50:03,079
Trying to fool us?

808
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:08,020
Hello? I liked the song very much.

809
00:50:08,091 --> 00:50:09,888
As you pressed star button..

810
00:50:09,959 --> 00:50:12,621
..double star officer and
no star Pc have arrived.

811
00:50:12,696 --> 00:50:15,096
Idiot. You steal in your boss' house.

812
00:50:15,165 --> 00:50:17,030
I will skin you.

813
00:50:20,937 --> 00:50:22,234
Sir, I'm not a thief.

814
00:50:22,305 --> 00:50:29,837
Madam Kavya asked me to keep
it and pass it to her later.

815
00:50:29,913 --> 00:50:32,245
I'm innocent.

816
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:34,144
Hurry up.

817
00:50:34,217 --> 00:50:35,878
Yes. Hurry up.

818
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,844
Put them into the basket.

819
00:50:38,922 --> 00:50:41,049
Are cops fools?

820
00:50:41,224 --> 00:50:42,384
You gave all your
belongings to Tirupathi..

821
00:50:42,659 --> 00:50:44,024
..and but lodged a complaint.

822
00:50:44,094 --> 00:50:45,220
I respected you so much.

823
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:47,923
Like in Bangalore you think
you can fool around here as well?

824
00:50:47,997 --> 00:50:51,797
You said there must be a
reason to see someone.

825
00:50:51,868 --> 00:50:53,893
How can I meet you
without any reasons!

826
00:50:54,738 --> 00:50:56,035
Why must you meet me?

827
00:50:56,106 --> 00:51:02,011
Don't you know what it means
when a girl keeps following you?

828
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:06,774
What does it mean!
- It means she likes him.

829
00:51:06,816 --> 00:51:09,307
It means she loves him.
I never felt like this before.

830
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,386
Guys are so egoistic..

831
00:51:13,656 --> 00:51:18,616
..but you, without any ego,
told me to hit you.

832
00:51:18,695 --> 00:51:20,686
That's what impressed me.

833
00:51:20,764 --> 00:51:24,200
I have never seen a cop like you.

834
00:51:24,634 --> 00:51:28,832
Your intelligence and
responsibility made me fall for you.

835
00:51:29,906 --> 00:51:30,964
I love you!

836
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:53,128
''I'm 18 years old now.''

837
00:51:53,663 --> 00:51:57,827
''A kind sweet feeling
has developed in me.''

838
00:51:57,967 --> 00:51:59,696
''My man.''

839
00:51:59,769 --> 00:52:02,761
''You stole my heart
without my knowledge.''

840
00:52:03,006 --> 00:52:04,837
''My man.''

841
00:52:04,908 --> 00:52:08,002
''You stole my heart
without my knowledge.''

842
00:52:08,812 --> 00:52:13,806
''I'm 18 years old now.''

843
00:52:13,983 --> 00:52:18,386
''A kind sweet feeling
has developed in me.''

844
00:52:18,621 --> 00:52:20,350
''Gradually.''

845
00:52:20,623 --> 00:52:23,683
''Gradually..

846
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,252
..fell in love gradually.''

847
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:29,389
Rs. 300, 400, 500.

848
00:52:29,632 --> 00:52:30,894
Aunt.
- Give the money.

849
00:52:31,634 --> 00:52:32,862
How are you?

850
00:52:33,303 --> 00:52:35,134
Well..
- Is he at home?

851
00:52:35,205 --> 00:52:36,797
He's inside. Go.

852
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:41,940
You really don't understand?

853
00:52:42,145 --> 00:52:43,806
You are a typical village boy.
- What?

854
00:52:43,913 --> 00:52:46,905
You can even get close
to marrying another girl..

855
00:52:46,983 --> 00:52:51,317
..but I'll insist you to
tie the nuptial chain to me.

856
00:52:51,754 --> 00:52:54,245
For love, I lied I lost my bag.

857
00:52:54,657 --> 00:52:57,319
I'll even lie you molested
me to marry you. - You..

858
00:52:57,393 --> 00:53:00,988
I'll lie that you took me to a
hotel in Hubli and molested me.

859
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:02,324
What are you saying?
- Good bye!

860
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:03,759
Kavya, drink some water.

861
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:07,633
No, thanks, sister.
- Sister?

862
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:13,599
''Girl, I didn't tell myself
that I'm in love with you.''

863
00:53:13,676 --> 00:53:18,170
''I'm so glad.''

864
00:53:18,781 --> 00:53:24,014
''There's so much
brightness in my life.''

865
00:53:24,287 --> 00:53:28,621
''I the school of love.''

866
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:34,296
''Together, let's learn..

867
00:53:34,664 --> 00:53:39,363
..the lesson of love.''

868
00:53:39,702 --> 00:53:44,071
''Love is our Guru.''

869
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,767
''My man.''

870
00:53:45,909 --> 00:53:48,901
''You stole my heart
without my knowledge.''

871
00:53:49,145 --> 00:53:50,908
''My man.''

872
00:53:51,014 --> 00:53:54,415
''You stole my heart
without my knowledge.''

873
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:16,070
''Like a mustache to the sun.''

874
00:54:16,139 --> 00:54:20,803
''I have this doubt when I see you.''

875
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:25,904
''I feel the same..

876
00:54:25,982 --> 00:54:31,386
..when I see you smile.''

877
00:54:31,654 --> 00:54:36,682
''All I want is you.''

878
00:54:36,893 --> 00:54:41,626
''When did we fall for each other?''

879
00:54:41,764 --> 00:54:46,030
''It happened just moments ago.''

880
00:54:46,102 --> 00:54:50,300
''I too..

881
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,142
..fell in love gradually.''

882
00:54:56,245 --> 00:54:58,110
''My man.''

883
00:54:58,214 --> 00:55:01,581
''You stole my heart
without my knowledge.''

884
00:55:01,651 --> 00:55:03,243
''I too..

885
00:55:03,319 --> 00:55:06,311
..fell in love gradually.''

886
00:55:26,376 --> 00:55:28,810
Our work will be done if we sign..

887
00:55:28,911 --> 00:55:30,105
..the attendance for 14 days more.
- I see.

888
00:55:30,179 --> 00:55:32,113
Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

889
00:55:33,016 --> 00:55:35,883
Who are they?- They were
here to sign the condition bail.

890
00:55:35,952 --> 00:55:37,078
Good morning, sir.

891
00:55:37,153 --> 00:55:38,711
Where are they from!
- Bangalore.

892
00:55:39,689 --> 00:55:43,284
Bangalore?
- But they are speaking Hubli Kannada.

893
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,621
call them.

894
00:55:44,694 --> 00:55:46,753
Go and call them.
- Okay, sir.

895
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:49,658
Armugam, sir wants to meet you.

896
00:55:53,036 --> 00:55:54,731
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings, sir.

897
00:55:54,804 --> 00:55:56,362
What is your name?
- Armugam.

898
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:00,006
What is your father's name?
- Name? Well..

899
00:56:01,177 --> 00:56:02,769
Why are you hesitating!

900
00:56:02,879 --> 00:56:04,847
Your mother never told you his name?

901
00:56:05,982 --> 00:56:08,280
Show me the ID card.
- Actually..

902
00:56:08,851 --> 00:56:10,716
We are Matka chandrappa's men.

903
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:12,721
Boss chandrappa sent us to sign..

904
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:15,587
..as Armugam couldn't come.

905
00:56:16,726 --> 00:56:18,216
Who is Matka chandrappa?

906
00:56:20,229 --> 00:56:23,596
Please don't mistake me.

907
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,995
I should've personally come here..

908
00:56:26,235 --> 00:56:30,968
..but I was busy with work
at in Sri Lanka harbour.

909
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,270
Where is Armugam? -He's in Bangalore.

910
00:56:33,776 --> 00:56:36,870
My men will sign the attendance.

911
00:56:37,013 --> 00:56:38,275
Give it to me.

912
00:56:40,216 --> 00:56:42,275
Keep this for your expenses.

913
00:56:42,351 --> 00:56:44,649
If you want more..
- Get up!

914
00:56:45,121 --> 00:56:46,850
How dare you bribe me?

915
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:51,024
It is 9:30 now. I want
him here in 4 hours.

916
00:56:51,094 --> 00:56:52,322
How is it possible?

917
00:56:52,395 --> 00:56:54,795
There's a flight at
10:45 from Bangalore.

918
00:56:54,864 --> 00:56:58,356
It'll reach at 12:30. I
want him here in one hour.

919
00:56:58,634 --> 00:57:03,333
Else I'll get an arrest
warrant and arrest him in Bangalore.

920
00:57:03,573 --> 00:57:06,565
If you give me an excuse..

921
00:57:06,642 --> 00:57:09,042
..that the pilot cannot fly
the plain due to bad weather..

922
00:57:09,078 --> 00:57:11,876
..or if the driver gives
reasons not to drive..

923
00:57:11,948 --> 00:57:14,610
..I'll thrash you along with
Armugam and put you behind the bars.

924
00:57:14,684 --> 00:57:15,912
Get away!

925
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:42,907
Where is the S.I?

926
00:57:43,212 --> 00:57:46,079
Where is he?
- He went out.

927
00:57:46,115 --> 00:57:48,811
To hell with him. Ask him to come.

928
00:57:49,152 --> 00:57:50,710
I'll teach him today.

929
00:57:54,056 --> 00:57:57,287
Sir! - Why so many vehicles
are parked outside?

930
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,124
Armugam is here.
- Boss, he's the S.I.

931
00:58:00,196 --> 00:58:02,562
He's been waiting for you.

932
00:58:02,665 --> 00:58:04,326
Why didn't you take his
signature and send him?

933
00:58:05,034 --> 00:58:07,662
How dare you ignore me?

934
00:58:07,737 --> 00:58:08,897
Do you know who I am?

935
00:58:08,971 --> 00:58:11,872
Do you know my range?
- Who are you?

936
00:58:12,175 --> 00:58:14,666
You're a murderer. I read your file.

937
00:58:14,977 --> 00:58:17,036
You threatened a man
until he committed suicide.

938
00:58:20,316 --> 00:58:22,784
What's the proof you are Armugam?
Show me your ID!

939
00:58:23,586 --> 00:58:26,111
Is this all your influence in Hubli?

940
00:58:26,656 --> 00:58:28,749
What's the matter? Why is he yelling?

941
00:58:28,825 --> 00:58:30,224
Nothing. It's an ordinary case.

942
00:58:30,293 --> 00:58:33,285
You're saying nothing,
but they came with knives.

943
00:58:33,362 --> 00:58:34,795
They are also threatening you.

944
00:58:34,864 --> 00:58:36,923
You shouldn't interfere. Please leave.

945
00:58:36,999 --> 00:58:41,936
We won't come in, but we'll not
spare them if they create problem.

946
00:58:42,004 --> 00:58:43,062
Let's go.

947
00:58:43,739 --> 00:58:47,368
They are complimenting each other.

948
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:49,703
No one except the
accused should be here.

949
00:58:49,779 --> 00:58:51,269
Send them out.
- Get out.

950
00:58:51,314 --> 00:58:52,713
Accused?

951
00:58:53,115 --> 00:58:58,018
I can destroy you and
this station if I want to.

952
00:58:58,187 --> 00:59:00,587
I will destroy everything.

953
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,861
Stop! Why are you
breaking the glasses?

954
00:59:10,933 --> 00:59:12,628
Stop it!

955
00:59:12,702 --> 00:59:16,570
No one should leave this place
alive after going against you.

956
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:18,266
He's right.
- calm down.

957
00:59:18,341 --> 00:59:22,937
Are you threatening me
with your men? I'll kill you..

958
00:59:24,247 --> 00:59:26,272
They are very angry, don't say a word.

959
00:59:26,549 --> 00:59:27,607
Mada!
- It's better we leave.

960
00:59:27,683 --> 00:59:28,707
Mada, get down from the vehicle.

961
00:59:28,784 --> 00:59:30,877
You can arrest us for
destroying this vehicle..

962
00:59:30,953 --> 00:59:32,614
..but if anyone talk against you..

963
00:59:32,688 --> 00:59:33,780
..I'll kill him with this weapon.

964
00:59:33,856 --> 00:59:35,585
We'll sacrifice our
lives for brother Kempe.

965
00:59:35,658 --> 00:59:37,091
We'll tear you apart
if you mess with him.

966
00:59:38,094 --> 00:59:39,652
calm down.

967
00:59:41,931 --> 00:59:45,162
Did you understand? I
don't know who he is.

968
00:59:45,601 --> 00:59:49,002
Do you know what will
happen if I raise my voice!

969
00:59:49,138 --> 00:59:52,073
Don't show your power to me.

970
00:59:52,241 --> 00:59:54,971
You thought you can take me easily!

971
00:59:55,011 --> 00:59:59,880
This is my place. They
are like my family members.

972
01:00:00,016 --> 01:00:01,950
They'll kill you if you..

973
01:00:02,018 --> 01:00:04,248
..touch even one strand of my eyebrow.

974
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,653
Make sure you sign and
leave this place quietly.

975
01:00:14,931 --> 01:00:16,956
For the rest of the 14
days I want you to quietly..

976
01:00:17,033 --> 01:00:19,729
..come sign your
attendance and leave this place.

977
01:00:20,102 --> 01:00:23,128
Get going. Get going!

978
01:00:33,349 --> 01:00:35,817
Boss, listen to me. calm down.

979
01:00:35,885 --> 01:00:37,409
Sit for sometime.

980
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,252
Why is this alone not broken?

981
01:00:46,429 --> 01:00:48,659
check if they've
forgot something else.

982
01:00:49,298 --> 01:00:51,732
He got posting in his own village.

983
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:54,269
And it is Hubli M.L.A
Nagaraj Katwe who posted him.

984
01:00:54,337 --> 01:00:57,135
What's the relationship between them?
- It's just a recommendation.

985
01:00:58,274 --> 01:01:02,301
He messed with me.

986
01:01:03,312 --> 01:01:05,906
He will pay a price for it.

987
01:01:09,285 --> 01:01:11,776
Kavya, you must visit us every year.
- Okay.

988
01:01:11,854 --> 01:01:13,082
understand?

989
01:01:13,155 --> 01:01:15,214
Be careful of the 4
acre coconut plantation.

990
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:17,225
What is it about?
- Nothing.

991
01:01:17,293 --> 01:01:19,022
Let it be.

992
01:01:19,228 --> 01:01:23,631
Go to the temple on
your way back home.

993
01:01:23,799 --> 01:01:26,029
Mahadeva, you must come
every year with children.- Okay.

994
01:01:26,102 --> 01:01:27,763
Grandfather, grandmother, bye.

995
01:01:27,837 --> 01:01:29,828
Take care.
- Take care.

996
01:01:29,905 --> 01:01:31,395
Greetings, sir. Where is your family?

997
01:01:31,674 --> 01:01:34,040
Greetings, Mahadeva.
- Greetings.

998
01:01:34,343 --> 01:01:36,937
You hardly stay here.
- I don't find time.

999
01:01:37,013 --> 01:01:38,207
Greetings, sir.

1000
01:01:38,314 --> 01:01:40,714
You must attend my
daughter's wedding next month.

1001
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:43,284
Please come and bless her.

1002
01:01:43,352 --> 01:01:45,411
I'll definitely attend.
- Where does the groom hail from?

1003
01:01:45,688 --> 01:01:46,882
He hails from same village.

1004
01:01:46,956 --> 01:01:49,220
What is the groom doing?
- He's a cop in Mandhya.

1005
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:52,124
Don't get her married to a cop.
- Why!

1006
01:01:52,294 --> 01:01:54,728
Only useless people
will become a police.

1007
01:01:54,797 --> 01:01:56,094
What are you talking?

1008
01:01:56,165 --> 01:01:59,259
Only people who are
loyal become police.

1009
01:01:59,335 --> 01:02:00,597
You better watch your words.

1010
01:02:00,669 --> 01:02:03,604
I did not refer to anyone.
- Why say it publicly?

1011
01:02:03,672 --> 01:02:05,003
Which cop is loyal?

1012
01:02:05,074 --> 01:02:07,065
My son is also a cop. And he's loyal.

1013
01:02:07,109 --> 01:02:09,100
Only wrong doers will hate the police.

1014
01:02:09,178 --> 01:02:10,668
You must be doing illicit business.

1015
01:02:10,713 --> 01:02:12,078
Do you know who you're talking to?

1016
01:02:12,114 --> 01:02:14,207
One of your daughters
will definitely marry a cop.

1017
01:02:14,316 --> 01:02:16,841
A good man will only see good things.

1018
01:02:17,019 --> 01:02:19,214
Only a bad man will see things badly.

1019
01:02:19,288 --> 01:02:21,347
It all depends on how one sees it.

1020
01:02:21,624 --> 01:02:22,989
You need to change
your attitude.. Quiet.

1021
01:02:23,059 --> 01:02:25,323
..and then come and talk to me.

1022
01:02:25,394 --> 01:02:27,726
We'd a small dream..

1023
01:02:27,797 --> 01:02:30,231
But he shattered it.

1024
01:02:33,169 --> 01:02:34,966
Sister, look there.

1025
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:43,701
You said you'll create
havoc and stop my wedding.

1026
01:02:44,613 --> 01:02:45,910
Will you stop it?
- I'll stop it.

1027
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,880
I can do it and I will do it.

1028
01:02:49,085 --> 01:02:50,643
You can't do it.
- Yes I can.

1029
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:52,311
Divya, tell him about me.

1030
01:02:52,388 --> 01:02:55,084
If my marriage stops, so will yours.
- What?

1031
01:02:56,058 --> 01:02:58,720
If the bride herself creates
havoc her marriage won't take place.

1032
01:03:00,162 --> 01:03:02,062
Sister, he has fallen for you.

1033
01:03:02,131 --> 01:03:04,258
He said you're the bride.

1034
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:07,761
Listen. You are my wife.

1035
01:03:08,637 --> 01:03:12,300
No matter what happens,
I'll only marry you.

1036
01:03:15,111 --> 01:03:17,079
Divya, I'm so happy.

1037
01:03:17,179 --> 01:03:19,113
I'm so happy.
- Sister.

1038
01:03:21,617 --> 01:03:22,709
Who is he?

1039
01:03:22,785 --> 01:03:25,185
The son of the man you
fought with you inside.

1040
01:03:28,691 --> 01:03:30,955
If you're a real man,
don't step on my land.

1041
01:03:31,026 --> 01:03:32,220
What's going on there?

1042
01:03:32,294 --> 01:03:33,886
They are quarrelling.

1043
01:03:34,029 --> 01:03:35,656
Guarantee?
- Yes, sir.

1044
01:03:36,632 --> 01:03:38,327
Hold it.
- Don't mess with me.

1045
01:03:38,701 --> 01:03:40,032
Why are you going against a woman?

1046
01:03:40,102 --> 01:03:41,626
You should be ashamed.

1047
01:03:41,704 --> 01:03:42,898
Is this the way you
behave being a woman?

1048
01:03:42,972 --> 01:03:44,633
I'll put you both behind the bars.

1049
01:03:44,707 --> 01:03:46,937
Forgive us, sir.
- Forgive us, sir.

1050
01:03:47,009 --> 01:03:48,738
Will you both compromise?
- Yes, we will.

1051
01:03:48,844 --> 01:03:52,803
I'll deal this case
like S.I Kempe Gowda.

1052
01:03:52,848 --> 01:03:54,338
Shake hands.
- Sir, no!

1053
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:56,043
Do it.

1054
01:03:56,285 --> 01:03:57,377
Very good.

1055
01:03:57,653 --> 01:03:59,848
Now, hug each other.

1056
01:04:00,089 --> 01:04:02,614
Sir..
- Do as I say. come on.

1057
01:04:04,593 --> 01:04:06,083
I will surely be promoted.

1058
01:04:06,362 --> 01:04:09,126
I guess they're
crossing their limits. - Yes.

1059
01:04:09,198 --> 01:04:12,167
If everyone can be like them..

1060
01:04:12,234 --> 01:04:13,758
..then we can easily
combine the rivers.

1061
01:04:13,836 --> 01:04:15,736
Am I right? Let's go.
- Okay, sir.

1062
01:04:16,305 --> 01:04:18,830
Bhima is taking away Rama's wife.

1063
01:04:18,908 --> 01:04:21,900
That police constable is
responsible for it. Get him.

1064
01:04:22,178 --> 01:04:24,078
Why are they after us?

1065
01:04:24,113 --> 01:04:26,172
Probably, to thrash us.

1066
01:04:26,215 --> 01:04:28,376
Run!

1067
01:04:32,221 --> 01:04:33,711
Did you have food?

1068
01:04:36,992 --> 01:04:38,755
Why is everyone quiet?

1069
01:04:40,863 --> 01:04:42,387
What's this?

1070
01:04:43,732 --> 01:04:46,667
Kempu, you've been
promoted as inspector.

1071
01:04:46,735 --> 01:04:48,293
It has been 4 days since
you received this letter.

1072
01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:50,361
Why didn't you inform us?

1073
01:04:50,806 --> 01:04:53,639
You don't want us to know..

1074
01:04:53,709 --> 01:04:56,644
..or you decided to
leave without informing us.

1075
01:04:56,845 --> 01:04:58,904
I didn't want to
accept this promotion.

1076
01:04:59,014 --> 01:05:01,778
What's the reason?

1077
01:05:01,984 --> 01:05:04,214
The posting is in Bangalore.
I don't like to go there.

1078
01:05:05,154 --> 01:05:07,645
Why?
- I belong to this village.

1079
01:05:08,357 --> 01:05:12,020
I cannot stay away from you all.

1080
01:05:12,094 --> 01:05:16,963
Father will be proud
if you get promoted.

1081
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:21,727
It's a mistake to raise
him within us.

1082
01:05:22,071 --> 01:05:23,299
Mother..

1083
01:05:25,841 --> 01:05:32,303
I was very proud when you spoke
to the villagers the other day.

1084
01:05:32,681 --> 01:05:36,947
This post is what
made all that happen.

1085
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:39,611
Its okay if you don't..
- Father.

1086
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:43,951
I'll go to Bangalore.

1087
01:05:55,704 --> 01:05:57,831
Hello.
- Hi. - What is the lion doing?

1088
01:05:57,906 --> 01:05:58,998
Wondering on the street.

1089
01:05:59,074 --> 01:06:03,067
Take a flight and come
have dinner with me.

1090
01:06:03,145 --> 01:06:05,136
Okay. Give me your address.

1091
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:08,638
Serve her energy drink.
She's always studying.

1092
01:06:08,884 --> 01:06:11,751
You want black tea or black label?
- What?

1093
01:06:12,821 --> 01:06:14,254
Both are of same color.

1094
01:06:14,323 --> 01:06:15,847
Do you want black tea
or black coffee?

1095
01:06:15,924 --> 01:06:18,154
What rubbish are you talking?

1096
01:06:18,327 --> 01:06:20,693
come out to the
balcony immediately. - Why?

1097
01:06:20,763 --> 01:06:23,197
Didn't you watch the news
about earthquake in Bangalore?

1098
01:06:23,265 --> 01:06:25,825
Where? There's no earthquake here.

1099
01:06:25,901 --> 01:06:27,698
Watch properly.

1100
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:31,330
Where?
- Look straight. Hi.

1101
01:06:32,074 --> 01:06:33,371
Oh my, God.

1102
01:06:34,109 --> 01:06:35,804
Hi.
- Did you feel the earthquake?

1103
01:06:35,911 --> 01:06:37,811
How come you are here
in uniform and jeep?

1104
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:43,885
Now, I'm inspector of police,
Magadi Road.

1105
01:06:43,952 --> 01:06:45,613
Inspector, Magadi Road.

1106
01:06:45,688 --> 01:06:47,747
Oh my God. I'm so happy.

1107
01:06:47,823 --> 01:06:49,222
Tell them to let us know the estimate.

1108
01:06:49,291 --> 01:06:51,623
Police jeep in front of our house?

1109
01:06:57,833 --> 01:06:59,391
I don't know
anything about it, father.

1110
01:06:59,768 --> 01:07:01,133
Why never inform me earlier?

1111
01:07:01,203 --> 01:07:04,661
I wouldn't be able to
see your reaction then.

1112
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:06,571
I'm so excited.

1113
01:07:07,142 --> 01:07:10,168
What's going on here?
Who are you talking to?

1114
01:07:10,279 --> 01:07:13,180
Don't forget you are my daughter.
Don't ruin the family's reputation.

1115
01:07:13,248 --> 01:07:16,615
Delete his number first.
- Okay.

1116
01:07:17,286 --> 01:07:18,981
Right away.
- Okay.

1117
01:07:19,755 --> 01:07:22,019
Why are you getting upset with me?

1118
01:07:22,091 --> 01:07:23,683
I didn't tell her to call him?

1119
01:07:23,859 --> 01:07:26,589
Kavya, Divya said
he's from our village.

1120
01:07:26,662 --> 01:07:27,890
What is the family doing?

1121
01:07:27,963 --> 01:07:30,727
They own a provision store.
- That's great.

1122
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,130
We only have to give the list..

1123
01:07:32,201 --> 01:07:33,759
..and we'll get all the groceries.
- Mother.

1124
01:07:33,836 --> 01:07:35,804
If a thief enters our house..

1125
01:07:35,871 --> 01:07:37,771
..we don't have to go
to the police station.

1126
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,206
Son-in-law will nab him.
- Bharti!

1127
01:07:40,275 --> 01:07:41,606
Oh my God.

1128
01:07:41,677 --> 01:07:42,974
Mother, don't get tensed.

1129
01:07:43,011 --> 01:07:44,308
Why'll I get tensed?

1130
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:46,571
Are you going to Delete his number?

1131
01:07:46,682 --> 01:07:48,377
I will.- You'll Delete
brother-in-law's number.

1132
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:50,311
No. Your dad's number.

1133
01:08:05,768 --> 01:08:08,100
Don't use the same
section all the time..

1134
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:11,071
..if the new inspector comes..
- Here he comes.

1135
01:08:11,707 --> 01:08:13,572
Sir, I'm S.I. Bose, from crime branch.

1136
01:08:13,742 --> 01:08:15,175
Welcome, sir.
- Kempe Gowda.

1137
01:08:15,244 --> 01:08:16,677
Sir, he's sub inspector.
- Sir.

1138
01:08:16,779 --> 01:08:18,144
He's constable.
- Sir.

1139
01:08:18,247 --> 01:08:19,839
This is our staff.
- Sir.

1140
01:08:19,948 --> 01:08:22,940
That is law and order inspector's
room. And that's your room, sir.

1141
01:08:23,018 --> 01:08:25,043
There are 12 areas under our control..

1142
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,588
..but only Mandipet is critical.

1143
01:08:27,756 --> 01:08:29,724
Bose, how are you?

1144
01:08:29,792 --> 01:08:31,259
Where is inspector Murthy?

1145
01:08:31,326 --> 01:08:33,760
Is he the new Inspector?
- Get out!

1146
01:08:33,829 --> 01:08:36,059
Why are you fierce all the time?

1147
01:08:36,131 --> 01:08:40,067
He'll torture others by being honest.
- Sorry, sir.

1148
01:08:53,916 --> 01:08:56,817
What are you looking at?
Are you shocked?

1149
01:08:57,052 --> 01:09:01,216
That's why l brought you here.

1150
01:09:03,959 --> 01:09:07,986
..but I got you posted
to Magadi Road.

1151
01:09:08,664 --> 01:09:11,326
You tortured me
by making me come to..

1152
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,125
..your district and
village that's not on the map.

1153
01:09:14,203 --> 01:09:18,264
What can you do now?
This is my place.

1154
01:09:18,607 --> 01:09:23,772
My area. I can do
whatever I want from here.

1155
01:09:23,979 --> 01:09:26,846
I run the real estate mafia business.

1156
01:09:26,915 --> 01:09:28,849
This is Armugam's fort.

1157
01:09:29,785 --> 01:09:34,051
You were so arrogant
because you're a cop..

1158
01:09:34,122 --> 01:09:36,283
..I'll make sure you leave this job.

1159
01:09:37,793 --> 01:09:40,626
My men will keep
causing you problems.

1160
01:09:41,163 --> 01:09:44,599
They will mentally harass you.

1161
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,700
You'll regret being in this job..

1162
01:09:47,769 --> 01:09:52,968
..and also for going against Armugam.

1163
01:09:53,308 --> 01:09:55,276
You'll suffer every
moment of your life hereafter.

1164
01:10:11,193 --> 01:10:13,991
Inspector! Where are you?

1165
01:10:14,062 --> 01:10:16,724
Inspector! Arrest us!

1166
01:10:16,798 --> 01:10:18,231
Who are you guys?
- We're Armugam's men.

1167
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:19,733
We want to have criminal records.

1168
01:10:19,801 --> 01:10:21,200
I only can arrest you if
you've done anything wrong.

1169
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:23,636
In that case, I'll create it now!

1170
01:10:23,739 --> 01:10:25,366
How dare you slap a policeman?

1171
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:29,236
How dare you?
- Hit me! Thrash me!

1172
01:10:29,645 --> 01:10:31,613
come on! Hit me here,
hit me everywhere.

1173
01:10:31,747 --> 01:10:34,978
I very well know you'll hit me.

1174
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:37,951
I can come out from
lock up within one hour.

1175
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,282
Sir, Assistant
commissioner in the line.

1176
01:10:39,354 --> 01:10:42,755
Our friend in the line now.

1177
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:46,725
Sir.
- Why did you arrest Armugam's men?

1178
01:10:46,795 --> 01:10:49,389
I didn't arrest them yet.
- You'll not do that.

1179
01:10:50,198 --> 01:10:51,790
You'll not.

1180
01:10:51,867 --> 01:10:53,664
But, sir..
- Do what I say.

1181
01:10:53,735 --> 01:10:55,293
understand?
- Yes, sir.

1182
01:11:05,314 --> 01:11:10,217
Who pelted stone at his house?
- It's me.

1183
01:11:10,285 --> 01:11:12,776
I would've broke his head,
but he stopped me.

1184
01:11:12,854 --> 01:11:15,846
He will run in one day then.

1185
01:11:22,998 --> 01:11:25,990
Play well. My turn. Give it me.

1186
01:11:26,702 --> 01:11:28,693
We received a call saying that
murder took place in this area?

1187
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:31,261
Greeting, sir. He is the one, sir.

1188
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:34,309
Everyday he is
killing goats and chickens.

1189
01:11:34,343 --> 01:11:36,038
That's why my men called the police.

1190
01:11:36,111 --> 01:11:38,102
Everyday he commits murders.

1191
01:11:38,213 --> 01:11:40,147
Arrest him, sir.

1192
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:52,116
Hi.
- I want to meet up you immediately.

1193
01:11:53,662 --> 01:11:55,425
So?
- I want to resign my job.

1194
01:11:55,697 --> 01:11:56,959
You are a man always
fight for justice..

1195
01:11:57,032 --> 01:11:58,192
..so you can't simply resign.

1196
01:11:58,266 --> 01:12:01,099
If I go for justice I
have to shoot everyone.

1197
01:12:01,169 --> 01:12:03,933
Shoot them! That's why the
government gave you gun!

1198
01:12:04,006 --> 01:12:06,338
I have to kill 100s.

1199
01:12:06,608 --> 01:12:09,270
You can kill 1000s.

1200
01:12:09,311 --> 01:12:11,609
You're not going to
kill good people, right?

1201
01:12:11,913 --> 01:12:15,178
Will the villagers
respect you if you go back?

1202
01:12:15,384 --> 01:12:17,375
Will your parents feel happy?

1203
01:12:17,619 --> 01:12:20,281
Or, will you be able
to sleep in peace?

1204
01:12:21,023 --> 01:12:25,050
If you avoid,
people will mistake you.

1205
01:12:25,894 --> 01:12:27,725
I'm from respective family.

1206
01:12:28,296 --> 01:12:30,321
I was brought up by
those who fought for justice.

1207
01:12:30,399 --> 01:12:33,095
Have work with good people,
but here, totally different.

1208
01:12:33,402 --> 01:12:35,233
Feel so disgusted here.

1209
01:12:35,303 --> 01:12:37,203
Then, who will bring justice?

1210
01:12:37,272 --> 01:12:38,933
Be brave.

1211
01:12:39,007 --> 01:12:40,099
Don't give in.

1212
01:12:40,175 --> 01:12:42,234
What will be my answer
if my father asked..

1213
01:12:42,344 --> 01:12:45,905
..whether I'm going marry a coward ?

1214
01:12:46,248 --> 01:12:48,944
The other day in the theatre..

1215
01:12:49,117 --> 01:12:52,143
..you fought with
the goons like a lion.

1216
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:53,812
Where's that anger gone?

1217
01:12:54,056 --> 01:12:56,957
Because that goon abused me..

1218
01:12:57,025 --> 01:12:58,754
..your thrashed him
throwing away your revolver..

1219
01:12:58,827 --> 01:13:00,294
..where did that braveness go?

1220
01:13:00,328 --> 01:13:05,891
A wife will hope that her husband..

1221
01:13:06,735 --> 01:13:09,761
..doesn't fall in trouble.

1222
01:13:09,838 --> 01:13:12,602
But not the lover.

1223
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:14,801
Not lover would
tolerate her man losing.

1224
01:13:16,111 --> 01:13:17,578
Look, he's there.

1225
01:13:19,614 --> 01:13:23,141
Having good time
with your girlfriend?

1226
01:13:24,219 --> 01:13:27,052
Wonderful dress. Did
you buy it for her?

1227
01:13:47,142 --> 01:13:49,406
To hell with this signal.

1228
01:14:05,127 --> 01:14:06,185
Get him!

1229
01:14:43,999 --> 01:14:48,060
You said you'll be released
in one hour if I arrested you.

1230
01:14:48,203 --> 01:14:50,637
come on. Now, I'm giving you time.

1231
01:14:50,705 --> 01:14:54,197
call your boss and tell him
to save before I kill you.

1232
01:14:54,242 --> 01:14:56,107
Put us down.
- come on!

1233
01:14:56,945 --> 01:14:58,003
Put them down.

1234
01:16:20,262 --> 01:16:23,823
I will deal with him.
- Boss, calm down.

1235
01:16:23,899 --> 01:16:25,867
I will deal with him. Let's go.

1236
01:16:31,673 --> 01:16:33,664
Give me the file.
- Here you're, madam.

1237
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:35,903
Sir, madam told me
to give this to you.

1238
01:16:44,819 --> 01:16:47,720
Sir, here's the file.
- Greetings, inspector.

1239
01:16:47,989 --> 01:16:51,117
I heard you are in anger.

1240
01:16:51,192 --> 01:16:53,752
I came here to make you calm down.

1241
01:16:53,828 --> 01:16:55,318
Is there any
personal matter between us?

1242
01:16:55,397 --> 01:16:57,092
Let's put an end to our fight.

1243
01:16:57,165 --> 01:16:58,359
Let bygones be bygones.

1244
01:16:58,633 --> 01:17:00,999
Boss asked me to
compromise with you.

1245
01:17:01,069 --> 01:17:04,971
Boss has decided to let
you go freely in this city.

1246
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,771
So?
- Release our men.

1247
01:17:08,843 --> 01:17:11,539
The case has been filed in.
- Just tear it off.

1248
01:17:11,646 --> 01:17:14,308
We will print more books for you.

1249
01:17:27,195 --> 01:17:28,685
Very good.

1250
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,033
Why did you tear the FIR?

1251
01:17:34,669 --> 01:17:36,364
Why did you tear the FIR?

1252
01:17:36,638 --> 01:17:38,196
He's kidding me.

1253
01:17:44,779 --> 01:17:47,304
Why did you tear the FIR?

1254
01:17:48,783 --> 01:17:51,047
Why did you tear the FIR?

1255
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,184
How dare you hit me though
you know whose brother I am?

1256
01:18:00,261 --> 01:18:02,729
You're not Lord
Rama's brother Lakshmana.

1257
01:18:02,797 --> 01:18:04,731
Or Dharmaraya's brother Arjana.

1258
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:06,790
Your brother is a evil.

1259
01:18:06,868 --> 01:18:08,961
Everyone is aware of it.

1260
01:18:09,037 --> 01:18:11,335
The way you entered this
police station is wrong.

1261
01:18:11,606 --> 01:18:14,769
You should not sit
here without permission.

1262
01:18:14,876 --> 01:18:19,074
Tearing off government
stuff is very wrong.

1263
01:18:19,547 --> 01:18:22,983
You and your brother
will never reform.

1264
01:18:23,051 --> 01:18:25,986
You two need to be taught a lesson.

1265
01:18:26,054 --> 01:18:30,081
You mess with Kenpe Gowda?

1266
01:18:30,759 --> 01:18:34,251
To hell with you and your brother.

1267
01:18:36,931 --> 01:18:38,694
Arrest them for
smuggling illegal alcohol

1268
01:18:38,767 --> 01:18:40,166
Seize the vehicle and
summon the photographer.

1269
01:18:40,235 --> 01:18:42,066
Okay, sir. click their snaps.

1270
01:18:44,339 --> 01:18:45,863
What do you think you're doing?

1271
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:49,376
Why are you simply filing cases?

1272
01:18:49,611 --> 01:18:51,169
Tear off the FIR.

1273
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:54,009
close Vaikunta's
case and release them.

1274
01:18:54,082 --> 01:18:56,642
Give me in writing
what you just said.

1275
01:18:56,818 --> 01:18:58,649
I will release them.
- Me?

1276
01:18:58,787 --> 01:19:02,086
This is not village to
smuggle illegal alcohol.

1277
01:19:02,157 --> 01:19:04,284
What you mean? Village is not
the only place for smuggling.

1278
01:19:04,559 --> 01:19:06,550
They can do smuggling at any place.

1279
01:19:06,628 --> 01:19:10,189
Then how did the alcohol
boxes get seized in the city?

1280
01:19:10,265 --> 01:19:14,793
Otherwise, are you
running alcohol business?

1281
01:19:14,869 --> 01:19:17,064
Do you know with whom you're
talking to? - Yes, I know.

1282
01:19:17,338 --> 01:19:20,774
You're not qualified
to claim yourself as Ac.

1283
01:19:20,875 --> 01:19:24,936
We just need willpower to
arrest criminals not position.

1284
01:19:25,046 --> 01:19:28,106
You came from a small
village in Dharwad..

1285
01:19:28,183 --> 01:19:31,346
..how dare you argue with me?

1286
01:19:31,586 --> 01:19:35,022
Maybe I belong to a
small village in Dharwad.

1287
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:38,856
And you maybe from
well developed city.

1288
01:19:38,927 --> 01:19:40,189
But both are policemen.

1289
01:19:40,261 --> 01:19:42,729
People carry money
with lion symbol on it.

1290
01:19:42,797 --> 01:19:45,322
But this Kempe Gowda
carries his lion in his heart.

1291
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,364
You've air-condition in
your cabin and I don't.

1292
01:19:48,636 --> 01:19:51,332
That's the only
difference between you and me.

1293
01:19:51,606 --> 01:19:53,198
Mind your tongue.

1294
01:19:53,274 --> 01:19:56,072
Else, I will suspend you.
- I don't care.

1295
01:19:56,611 --> 01:20:02,811
I will rather run
a grocery business.

1296
01:20:02,884 --> 01:20:06,217
But I will not stoop
like you for mere money.

1297
01:20:06,287 --> 01:20:07,948
Get away!
- Darn it.

1298
01:20:08,022 --> 01:20:10,047
This is one of police
station under my control.

1299
01:20:10,125 --> 01:20:12,753
It might under one of
your police station..

1300
01:20:12,827 --> 01:20:15,921
..but this is the only police
station under Kempe Gowda's control.

1301
01:20:15,997 --> 01:20:21,025
I'll not spare the one who
stop me from doing my duty.

1302
01:20:21,336 --> 01:20:22,701
Bring the vehicle.

1303
01:20:44,092 --> 01:20:46,060
What are you looking at?

1304
01:20:46,361 --> 01:20:48,329
You didn't expect me, right?

1305
01:20:48,396 --> 01:20:50,864
You didn't expect I'll
revolt against you, right?

1306
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:55,999
I came down to your place. come on.

1307
01:20:56,070 --> 01:21:00,029
Because you arrested my
men you think you're great?

1308
01:21:00,341 --> 01:21:02,901
I can summon thousands..

1309
01:21:03,011 --> 01:21:06,674
..of gangsters here within no time.

1310
01:21:06,714 --> 01:21:10,616
You want to challenge me?

1311
01:21:10,952 --> 01:21:15,616
You need to summon, but
with the snap of my fingers..

1312
01:21:16,124 --> 01:21:18,922
..there will be people
from all over Karnataka.

1313
01:21:18,993 --> 01:21:20,858
They will arrive within seconds.

1314
01:21:20,929 --> 01:21:22,226
Do you have the courage
to fight them?

1315
01:21:22,297 --> 01:21:24,356
Or you want fight one by one.

1316
01:21:24,632 --> 01:21:26,190
You decide. I'm ready.

1317
01:21:26,634 --> 01:21:30,798
Good people never boast
themselves though they are stronger.

1318
01:21:31,072 --> 01:21:34,303
Only cowards like you do that.

1319
01:21:34,342 --> 01:21:37,402
You're just an ordinary inspector.

1320
01:21:37,645 --> 01:21:40,341
I can make you lose your
job within 10 minutes.

1321
01:21:40,415 --> 01:21:42,679
come on! Do it! I want that.

1322
01:21:42,984 --> 01:21:49,412
If you do that it
means you got scared of me.

1323
01:21:49,691 --> 01:21:51,420
And if you get scared it mean I won.

1324
01:21:51,659 --> 01:21:54,389
You may have seen
lion in photos, on TV..

1325
01:21:54,662 --> 01:21:56,129
..or maybe in the zoo.

1326
01:21:56,197 --> 01:21:59,166
Have you ever seen it
walk in jungle bravely!

1327
01:21:59,701 --> 01:22:02,795
Have you ever seen
hunting its prey with rage?

1328
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:06,362
You will collapse if I slap you.

1329
01:22:06,608 --> 01:22:07,700
Do you want to see?

1330
01:22:07,809 --> 01:22:09,208
Do you want to see?

1331
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:15,841
These are the hands which
used to carry heavy sacks.

1332
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:19,918
I never bow down to anyone.

1333
01:22:22,023 --> 01:22:25,220
You may have seen
policeman wearing uniform..

1334
01:22:25,660 --> 01:22:27,958
..but you may have not
seen his anger.

1335
01:22:28,029 --> 01:22:32,261
God never fails to save
the one who is in trouble.

1336
01:22:32,967 --> 01:22:35,834
And the one who trouble others
Kempe Gowda will not spare him.

1337
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:42,398
I'm in Banaswadi.
- You're in Madiwala.

1338
01:22:45,613 --> 01:22:48,844
He have humiliated
me at my place itself.

1339
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:51,849
Other than real estate business..

1340
01:22:51,919 --> 01:22:53,682
..I guess he also run
other illicit business as well.

1341
01:22:53,755 --> 01:22:56,087
He put me to shame
coming into my area.

1342
01:22:56,724 --> 01:22:57,816
Even my wife will
not respect me anymore.

1343
01:22:57,892 --> 01:23:00,292
I think he's doing other
illicit business as well.

1344
01:23:00,328 --> 01:23:02,694
I'd taken him for granted.

1345
01:23:02,964 --> 01:23:04,090
But he's dangerous.

1346
01:23:04,165 --> 01:23:05,894
When is the case coming
to hearing? - Next week.

1347
01:23:05,967 --> 01:23:07,229
Once the case is over..

1348
01:23:07,302 --> 01:23:09,827
..I'll chop him inside
the police station itself.

1349
01:23:09,904 --> 01:23:11,804
I will teach him.

1350
01:23:14,809 --> 01:23:16,071
Yes, Kavya?
- Where are you?

1351
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:17,270
Hossur Road.

1352
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:18,703
What are you doing?

1353
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:21,271
Going to resort with
family since it is weekend.

1354
01:23:21,349 --> 01:23:22,611
I will catch you later.
- Okay.

1355
01:23:22,684 --> 01:23:23,708
Bye.
- Bye.

1356
01:23:23,785 --> 01:23:24,979
Father, there will be
plenty of traffic in Sarjapur.

1357
01:23:25,053 --> 01:23:26,680
Why don't we take Hossur Road?
- Right.

1358
01:23:26,754 --> 01:23:29,245
Right.
- Stop! Stop!

1359
01:23:29,624 --> 01:23:32,855
What's going on?
- Sir, a routine check up.

1360
01:23:33,094 --> 01:23:35,392
Okay.
- Give me your Rc book and license.

1361
01:23:35,663 --> 01:23:39,099
Kavya, where are you?
- Turn to your left.

1362
01:23:40,401 --> 01:23:41,959
Why did you bring them here?

1363
01:23:42,036 --> 01:23:43,765
Sorry, I forgot my license.

1364
01:23:43,838 --> 01:23:46,363
Sir, he has Rc book
but forgot license.

1365
01:23:46,741 --> 01:23:48,140
I know them well. Let them go.

1366
01:23:48,209 --> 01:23:51,804
You want license,
right? I will show to you.

1367
01:23:53,314 --> 01:23:56,249
Why is your father being stubborn?

1368
01:23:57,685 --> 01:23:59,016
Give me the phone.

1369
01:23:59,087 --> 01:24:01,851
Give it to me.
- My mother wants to talk to you.

1370
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:03,989
How are you?
- Greetings, aunt.

1371
01:24:04,058 --> 01:24:06,583
I'm very sorry. We're so near,
but can't talk to each other.

1372
01:24:06,661 --> 01:24:11,360
I would've come, but
your husband is very angry.

1373
01:24:11,966 --> 01:24:15,299
Don't bother him.
- Give it to me. - Wait a minute.

1374
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:17,998
Bring your parents home someday.
- Okay.

1375
01:24:18,072 --> 01:24:19,369
Give it to me.

1376
01:24:21,109 --> 01:24:24,601
Why so excited over the phone?
- We're talking to our relative.

1377
01:24:24,679 --> 01:24:27,705
I'm standing in heat. And you
all are enjoying in the car.

1378
01:24:27,782 --> 01:24:29,249
You too come and sit inside.

1379
01:24:29,317 --> 01:24:31,911
Don't argue. And stop laughing.

1380
01:24:33,688 --> 01:24:35,121
Why so long?
- Sorry, sir.

1381
01:24:35,189 --> 01:24:37,180
Show it to him.
- Sir, license.

1382
01:24:37,859 --> 01:24:39,053
Let them go.
- Okay, sir.

1383
01:24:39,127 --> 01:24:40,219
Here you're.

1384
01:24:40,862 --> 01:24:43,023
I don't need anyone's help.

1385
01:25:07,288 --> 01:25:12,248
''You're deep inside me.''

1386
01:25:12,693 --> 01:25:17,255
''I dream during the day as well.''

1387
01:25:17,331 --> 01:25:20,061
''My heart dancing with joy.''

1388
01:25:20,134 --> 01:25:22,364
''It is unstoppable.''

1389
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:25,238
''I think of you all the time.''

1390
01:25:25,306 --> 01:25:28,002
''That I all I do.''

1391
01:25:48,396 --> 01:25:54,426
''You're deep inside me.''

1392
01:25:54,669 --> 01:25:59,663
''I dream during the day as well.''

1393
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:32,606
''You're like the moon.''

1394
01:26:32,673 --> 01:26:36,370
''For the first time I'm
seeing a deer which can talk.''

1395
01:26:36,611 --> 01:26:41,241
''I always belong to you.''

1396
01:26:41,315 --> 01:26:46,343
''You brought sweetness in me.''

1397
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:51,858
''You're my girl in all births.''

1398
01:26:51,926 --> 01:26:56,363
''You're lucky for me.''

1399
01:26:57,064 --> 01:26:59,624
''My heart dancing with joy.''

1400
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:02,168
''It is unstoppable.''

1401
01:27:02,236 --> 01:27:04,761
''I think of you all the time.''

1402
01:27:04,839 --> 01:27:07,569
''That I all I do.''

1403
01:27:31,299 --> 01:27:36,396
''Day by day..

1404
01:27:36,637 --> 01:27:41,597
..I'm getting closer to you.''

1405
01:27:41,809 --> 01:27:44,277
''Tell me why.''

1406
01:27:44,378 --> 01:27:47,006
''Quietly chant my name..

1407
01:27:47,081 --> 01:27:51,609
..and think about me all the time.''

1408
01:27:51,686 --> 01:27:56,714
''I'm fallen in love.''

1409
01:27:56,791 --> 01:28:02,195
''I'm being lenient to you.''

1410
01:28:07,301 --> 01:28:10,361
''I feel so good being with you.''

1411
01:28:31,592 --> 01:28:36,325
''You're deep inside me.''

1412
01:28:36,797 --> 01:28:42,030
''I dream during the day as well.''

1413
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,166
When did you reach?
- A while ago.

1414
01:29:15,369 --> 01:29:17,599
You realized how sincere
my father is.

1415
01:29:17,672 --> 01:29:19,833
He made sure he showed the license.

1416
01:29:19,907 --> 01:29:21,966
It would've been better
if he'd not shown it. - Why?

1417
01:29:22,076 --> 01:29:23,566
It expired three months ago.

1418
01:29:23,644 --> 01:29:25,839
One may need to pay a fine of Rs.
5000 and sentenced for one month.

1419
01:29:26,681 --> 01:29:28,342
What happened?
- Who's on the line?

1420
01:29:29,183 --> 01:29:30,309
Inspector, right?

1421
01:29:31,252 --> 01:29:32,617
He wants to know
what time we're leaving.

1422
01:29:33,354 --> 01:29:34,719
Which route we'll be passing by.

1423
01:29:35,256 --> 01:29:36,587
The place where he has to wait.

1424
01:29:36,924 --> 01:29:38,016
He wants to know everything,
isn't it?

1425
01:29:38,659 --> 01:29:41,822
He said you need to go to
the RTO tomorrow morning.

1426
01:29:42,029 --> 01:29:43,121
Why?

1427
01:29:43,764 --> 01:29:46,892
And also to carry your license
along with three passport size photos.

1428
01:29:47,068 --> 01:29:49,798
Your license expired three months ago.

1429
01:29:50,037 --> 01:29:54,906
One may need to pay a fine of Rs.
5000 and sentenced for one month.

1430
01:29:55,676 --> 01:30:00,875
He said he let you go
because you're my father.

1431
01:30:00,948 --> 01:30:02,779
I see. Okay.

1432
01:30:03,651 --> 01:30:05,118
You don't have to smile. Okay?

1433
01:30:07,188 --> 01:30:09,816
What are you doing here?
- Oh God.

1434
01:30:14,095 --> 01:30:15,187
This should be the place.

1435
01:30:15,429 --> 01:30:17,158
I've come to the right address.

1436
01:30:18,833 --> 01:30:19,925
Sir, you?

1437
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,662
I got suspended by
new S.I for 2 months.

1438
01:30:22,737 --> 01:30:25,968
Get me posted here. I
want to be with you.

1439
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,200
Why you got suspended?

1440
01:30:27,241 --> 01:30:28,333
Flashback, first shot.

1441
01:30:28,409 --> 01:30:30,707
A truck carrying smuggled goods..

1442
01:30:30,811 --> 01:30:32,904
..he heading towards
check post. Stop it!

1443
01:30:33,948 --> 01:30:36,348
I'll stop the truck even
at the cost of my life.

1444
01:30:36,417 --> 01:30:38,749
Don't let it go. I will
divorce a wife like yours..

1445
01:30:38,819 --> 01:30:40,252
..but I will not let the truck go.

1446
01:30:40,321 --> 01:30:43,848
Stop! Stop!
- Stop!

1447
01:30:44,024 --> 01:30:45,116
Get down. come on.

1448
01:30:45,326 --> 01:30:46,384
Greetings, sir.

1449
01:30:46,727 --> 01:30:47,921
I got information that you're
carrying One may need..

1450
01:30:47,995 --> 01:30:50,054
..to pay a fine of Rs. 5000
and sentenced for one month.

1451
01:30:50,131 --> 01:30:51,359
Search!
- Okay, yes.

1452
01:30:53,434 --> 01:30:55,026
Sir, the lorry contains nothing.

1453
01:30:55,102 --> 01:30:58,265
The new S.I embarrassed us
giving wrong information. Darn it.

1454
01:30:58,339 --> 01:31:00,899
We shouldn't have
suspected our friend here.

1455
01:31:01,308 --> 01:31:03,003
I'm, sorry. I'm extremely sorry.
- Thank you, sir.

1456
01:31:03,677 --> 01:31:05,076
come here.
- What is it?

1457
01:31:05,813 --> 01:31:08,008
Bring my moped by your truck..

1458
01:31:08,082 --> 01:31:09,879
..and fill two liters of
petrol at the gas station.

1459
01:31:10,317 --> 01:31:11,909
I will surely do that.

1460
01:31:16,624 --> 01:31:17,750
What are you doing?

1461
01:31:17,825 --> 01:31:19,087
Sir.
- Where is the truck?

1462
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:21,321
We didn't find any
smuggled goods in the truck.

1463
01:31:21,395 --> 01:31:24,364
Idiot. He smuggled the truck itself.

1464
01:31:24,431 --> 01:31:26,194
And you're suspended for two months.

1465
01:31:26,634 --> 01:31:28,363
Nonsense.

1466
01:31:36,343 --> 01:31:38,903
You may go.
- The one who is coming.

1467
01:31:39,246 --> 01:31:40,372
Hi.

1468
01:31:40,714 --> 01:31:41,908
Meet my friends.
- Hi. - Hi.

1469
01:31:41,982 --> 01:31:44,007
Girls, Mr. Kempe Gowda.
- Hello. - Hello.

1470
01:31:44,285 --> 01:31:46,651
Why everyone wearing in same color?

1471
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,779
This is our get together look.

1472
01:31:49,757 --> 01:31:51,281
Kempu has arrived, boss.

1473
01:31:51,358 --> 01:31:54,191
Did you invite them in last minute?
- No. Why?

1474
01:31:54,995 --> 01:31:57,691
They've come without
even combing their hair.

1475
01:31:57,765 --> 01:32:00,325
In my village, this
is how a woman looks..

1476
01:32:00,367 --> 01:32:01,698
..when she's possessed.

1477
01:32:02,703 --> 01:32:07,970
Why hiding your beauty
covering by your hair?

1478
01:32:09,677 --> 01:32:10,803
Happy?
- Yes.

1479
01:32:10,878 --> 01:32:11,970
I'll be right back.

1480
01:32:12,313 --> 01:32:13,575
Kavya..

1481
01:32:18,419 --> 01:32:20,751
Kempe Gowda is in the restaurant.
- What are you saying?

1482
01:32:20,821 --> 01:32:22,311
I saw him.
- Keep a watch on him.

1483
01:32:22,389 --> 01:32:23,788
I'll call you in a while.
- Okay, boss.

1484
01:32:32,266 --> 01:32:33,756
Why did Kempe Gowda come there?

1485
01:32:33,834 --> 01:32:35,859
Do one thing. Kidnap his daughter.

1486
01:32:35,936 --> 01:32:39,303
He interfered again.
I'll not spare him.

1487
01:32:44,345 --> 01:32:46,939
How dare you bring the police along?

1488
01:32:47,014 --> 01:32:50,973
Police? Believe me. I
didn't bring the police.

1489
01:32:51,385 --> 01:32:53,853
The ransom you asked for
is just my one week earning.

1490
01:32:54,021 --> 01:32:56,683
Why will I..?
- Be on the line.

1491
01:32:56,757 --> 01:32:59,248
I'm suspecting him unnecessarily.
I think nothing has happened.

1492
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:01,621
My men kidnapped your
daughter due to some confusion.

1493
01:33:01,695 --> 01:33:04,391
I told you I'll give the money,
right? Stopping worrying.

1494
01:33:04,632 --> 01:33:08,068
Go to hotel Blue
Lagoon exactly at 2 p.m.

1495
01:33:08,135 --> 01:33:09,602
Give them money and
take your daughter back.

1496
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:10,967
My daughter..
- Don't worry.

1497
01:33:11,038 --> 01:33:12,096
Please..
- Wait a minute.

1498
01:33:12,172 --> 01:33:13,799
Is anybody around?
- No one is here.

1499
01:33:13,908 --> 01:33:16,001
Drop your phone down
and staring running.

1500
01:33:16,076 --> 01:33:17,907
What?
- Do it now.

1501
01:33:18,579 --> 01:33:20,012
Did he drop the phone down?
- Yes, boss.

1502
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:21,647
check his phone.
- Okay.

1503
01:33:21,715 --> 01:33:22,943
check the call details.

1504
01:33:23,217 --> 01:33:24,946
He didn't make any calls
for that last one hour.

1505
01:33:25,786 --> 01:33:27,253
It's just a coincident.

1506
01:33:27,321 --> 01:33:29,221
You guys created
unnecessary tensions.

1507
01:33:29,290 --> 01:33:30,848
Had he come..

1508
01:33:31,625 --> 01:33:32,751
Overtake his car.

1509
01:33:34,828 --> 01:33:37,228
Where are you going?
- I'm going back home after work.

1510
01:33:37,364 --> 01:33:39,764
Your house is not around here.
- I don't really need to lie to you.

1511
01:33:39,967 --> 01:33:43,733
I've come following you doubting
your acts. Where are you going?

1512
01:33:43,804 --> 01:33:46,272
What's wrong with you?
I've a status in this society.

1513
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:48,035
What if..?
- What happened?

1514
01:33:48,108 --> 01:33:49,735
Kavya, your father is
hiding something from me.

1515
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:52,845
Sir, what's in the dickey? - These
are my personal belongings. You..

1516
01:33:52,913 --> 01:33:54,005
You're lying to me.

1517
01:33:54,081 --> 01:33:56,015
Please give him some respect.
- Tell your father to open the dickey.

1518
01:33:56,083 --> 01:33:57,448
What's the matter with you?
- Will you open or not?

1519
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:03,888
They have kidnapped my
second daughter Divya.

1520
01:34:08,095 --> 01:34:10,086
They've kidnapped her for money.
Nothing will happen to Divya. come.

1521
01:34:10,264 --> 01:34:12,824
I don't really need police help.

1522
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:14,060
Nothing will happen. Get in.

1523
01:34:14,234 --> 01:34:15,701
Give your phone. They
shouldn't know you've phone.

1524
01:34:18,951 --> 01:34:20,043
Bose!

1525
01:34:36,468 --> 01:34:38,959
Nothing should happen to Divya.
- Don't worry.

1526
01:34:43,609 --> 01:34:44,701
Sir, they're taking the money.

1527
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:46,402
Accused is more important than money.

1528
01:34:57,022 --> 01:34:58,182
Let Divya go to her father first.

1529
01:34:58,991 --> 01:35:00,083
Divya!

1530
01:35:00,158 --> 01:35:01,386
Father!

1531
01:35:26,018 --> 01:35:27,610
Bose! call the ambulance.

1532
01:35:27,819 --> 01:35:29,787
Tell me.
- Boss, Kempe Gowda nabbed our men.

1533
01:35:32,925 --> 01:35:36,122
The owner of the stolen phone is here.

1534
01:35:36,562 --> 01:35:37,893
Hello, sir.
- Where did you lose your phone?

1535
01:35:37,963 --> 01:35:39,897
I lost it in a coffee shop.

1536
01:35:39,965 --> 01:35:41,125
Why didn't you deactivate the number?

1537
01:35:41,366 --> 01:35:43,664
Someone answered the call
when I called yesterday.

1538
01:35:43,802 --> 01:35:45,429
When I told him I was in Jainagar..

1539
01:35:45,504 --> 01:35:46,698
..he told me he was
in Vidyaranyapuram..

1540
01:35:46,772 --> 01:35:47,864
..and asked me to come to
Malleshwaram in the evening..

1541
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:49,965
..to take back the phone.
That's why I didn't deactivate..

1542
01:35:50,008 --> 01:35:51,100
..nor lodge a police complaint.
- You may go

1543
01:35:51,376 --> 01:35:52,468
Thank you, sir.

1544
01:35:52,911 --> 01:35:55,379
One and half year ago a boy
went missing from Sadashivanagar.

1545
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:56,742
And the only clue we had was phone.

1546
01:35:56,815 --> 01:35:59,750
When the owner of the
phone was interrogated..

1547
01:35:59,818 --> 01:36:02,480
..he happened to give as
similar kind of statement.

1548
01:36:04,523 --> 01:36:06,753
I feel like both have some connection.

1549
01:36:06,825 --> 01:36:08,725
Peenya, Madiwala, J.P Nagar.

1550
01:36:08,927 --> 01:36:10,622
Banaswadi. Something fishy.

1551
01:36:19,871 --> 01:36:21,668
Hello, Sir. What brings
you here at this hour?

1552
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:24,573
I've heard you saying' Madiwala,
Banaswadi'.

1553
01:36:24,676 --> 01:36:25,734
Do you remember the place?

1554
01:36:25,777 --> 01:36:28,371
'I'm Banaswadi.'
- 'You're in Madiwala, not banaswadi.'

1555
01:36:28,447 --> 01:36:30,540
I heard a guy talking over the phone..

1556
01:36:30,616 --> 01:36:31,878
..when we'd been to Armugam's house.

1557
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:33,412
correct.

1558
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:35,948
Those from the
Patients' side, please go out.

1559
01:36:36,021 --> 01:36:37,386
Go out. come on.

1560
01:36:38,156 --> 01:36:39,418
You're such a fool.

1561
01:36:39,691 --> 01:36:41,090
Why didn't you tell me
you were Armugam's aide?

1562
01:36:41,727 --> 01:36:42,819
Even I'm Armugam's aide.

1563
01:36:43,595 --> 01:36:45,119
Had you told me earlier
I wouldn't have shot you.

1564
01:36:45,797 --> 01:36:47,458
Boss is upset with me.

1565
01:36:47,733 --> 01:36:50,361
I really didn't know
you're Boss's aide.

1566
01:36:52,137 --> 01:36:54,970
I've never seen you with Boss before.

1567
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,132
I'm from Kolar.

1568
01:36:56,375 --> 01:36:59,708
I come here, kidnap and
send the money to him often.

1569
01:37:02,481 --> 01:37:04,813
Armugam? I don't know him.

1570
01:37:06,418 --> 01:37:09,012
I'm disrupted by medicine.

1571
01:37:10,689 --> 01:37:11,781
It's okay.

1572
01:37:13,659 --> 01:37:14,751
Take care of yourself.

1573
01:37:17,963 --> 01:37:19,021
come. You may go inside.

1574
01:37:19,097 --> 01:37:20,394
It is Armugam's men
who kidnapped the girl.

1575
01:37:20,465 --> 01:37:21,864
He might've kidnapped many people.

1576
01:37:21,933 --> 01:37:23,594
I was indeed suspicious about him.

1577
01:37:23,669 --> 01:37:25,398
There's no official
complaint against him.

1578
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:27,768
We should make the victim to
lodge complaint. I will do it.

1579
01:37:27,973 --> 01:37:29,600
Are you telling the truth, sir?

1580
01:37:29,675 --> 01:37:32,041
They've admitted that they
kidnapped 15 people till now.

1581
01:37:32,077 --> 01:37:34,568
They've gained 40-50 lakhs from each.

1582
01:37:34,646 --> 01:37:36,807
If the victims willing to
come and lodge a complaint..

1583
01:37:36,882 --> 01:37:38,747
..we will return their money as well.

1584
01:37:38,817 --> 01:37:40,717
They would never tell the truth.

1585
01:37:40,786 --> 01:37:42,754
Kempe Gowda is playing trick.

1586
01:37:43,155 --> 01:37:46,056
We put ourselves into trouble.

1587
01:37:46,391 --> 01:37:49,792
channel and media have
highlighted our department.

1588
01:37:49,861 --> 01:37:52,386
How will I face the chief
Minister and home minister?

1589
01:37:52,464 --> 01:37:57,026
This is just a strategy to
know the number of victims.

1590
01:37:57,102 --> 01:38:01,732
We expected 15 families,
but 40 have turned up.

1591
01:38:03,575 --> 01:38:05,509
We are outside police
commissioner's office.

1592
01:38:05,577 --> 01:38:07,511
Parents of those kidnapped
children are present here.

1593
01:38:07,579 --> 01:38:08,705
Let's hear what they have to say.

1594
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:10,907
Only those who are involved in
illicit business didn't turn up.

1595
01:38:11,717 --> 01:38:14,618
The new boy simply giving interviews.

1596
01:38:14,686 --> 01:38:15,744
I want to meet him.

1597
01:38:15,821 --> 01:38:17,118
Sir, why you need to see him?

1598
01:38:17,556 --> 01:38:18,648
Just do what I say.

1599
01:38:21,727 --> 01:38:24,127
Sir.
- Sir. Where have you been so far?

1600
01:38:25,097 --> 01:38:27,463
I'm looking for an officer like you.

1601
01:38:27,933 --> 01:38:31,835
coming from a small village
you're creating havoc in the city.

1602
01:38:31,903 --> 01:38:36,772
Good.- Take action
against those who're involved.

1603
01:38:37,042 --> 01:38:38,873
Arrest them without hesitation.

1604
01:38:39,478 --> 01:38:41,070
You have my support.

1605
01:38:41,446 --> 01:38:44,415
I'm appointing you as
Kidnap Special Officer.

1606
01:38:45,450 --> 01:38:48,783
I'm promoting you as
Assistant commissioner.

1607
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,012
Sir.

1608
01:38:50,589 --> 01:38:53,649
Assistant commissioner of
police with immediate effect.

1609
01:38:55,627 --> 01:38:58,357
As assistant commissioner of
police with immediate effect.

1610
01:39:06,905 --> 01:39:07,997
All the best.

1611
01:39:08,406 --> 01:39:12,809
''Kempe Gowda with a
terrific mustache.''

1612
01:39:16,648 --> 01:39:21,085
''Set the evil of
fire with your anger.''

1613
01:39:24,990 --> 01:39:29,359
''Everyone fears when lion comes.''

1614
01:39:29,427 --> 01:39:31,088
''Everyone praise him.''

1615
01:39:31,329 --> 01:39:33,354
''You're the protector.''

1616
01:39:33,431 --> 01:39:36,923
''You're the king.''

1617
01:39:37,002 --> 01:39:41,598
''You're the king.''

1618
01:39:52,384 --> 01:39:54,750
Boss, I guess he's
coming arrest warrant.

1619
01:39:56,788 --> 01:39:59,348
Did you get scared
seeing the envelope?

1620
01:40:00,058 --> 01:40:01,355
This is my promotion order.

1621
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:04,485
You asked what I can do as
ordinary police officer.

1622
01:40:04,563 --> 01:40:07,123
Now I'm a Assistant
commissioner of Police.

1623
01:40:07,499 --> 01:40:09,091
Anti-kidnapping force.

1624
01:40:09,835 --> 01:40:11,735
That day, 1 magazine, 12 bullets.

1625
01:40:11,803 --> 01:40:14,033
Today, 3 magazines, 36 bullets.

1626
01:40:15,106 --> 01:40:19,736
I thought you only
commit ordinary crimes..

1627
01:40:19,811 --> 01:40:22,746
..but you also kidnap
children for ransom.

1628
01:40:22,948 --> 01:40:27,009
You kidnapped 40 people
until now. What do I do with you?

1629
01:40:27,085 --> 01:40:29,645
Not 40, I've kidnapped 55 people.

1630
01:40:29,721 --> 01:40:33,122
Gather witness if possible. Get away.

1631
01:40:33,959 --> 01:40:36,427
I will go. I will put an end..

1632
01:40:36,494 --> 01:40:39,054
..to all your illegal activities.
I will teach you.

1633
01:40:39,564 --> 01:40:40,622
You decide whether..

1634
01:40:40,699 --> 01:40:42,428
..I should use
arrest warrant or my gun.

1635
01:40:51,576 --> 01:40:55,842
''Kempe Gowda with a
terrific mustache.''

1636
01:40:55,947 --> 01:40:59,849
''Hail Lord Shiva!''

1637
01:40:59,918 --> 01:41:04,514
''Set the evil on
fire with your anger.''

1638
01:41:17,602 --> 01:41:18,899
Kempe Gowda!

1639
01:41:19,604 --> 01:41:20,901
Kempe Gowda!

1640
01:41:21,706 --> 01:41:23,037
Kempe Gowda!

1641
01:41:23,742 --> 01:41:25,039
Kempe Gowda!

1642
01:41:25,310 --> 01:41:27,642
You all carry on with our
construction work without any fear.

1643
01:41:27,946 --> 01:41:30,710
You don't have to
fear nor give him money.

1644
01:41:31,049 --> 01:41:32,311
Police is always with you.

1645
01:41:32,384 --> 01:41:38,584
''I'll not the one who
goes against the law.''

1646
01:41:38,657 --> 01:41:44,823
''I'll do anything to save my people.''

1647
01:41:44,896 --> 01:41:46,864
''You're a bravo.''

1648
01:41:46,932 --> 01:41:48,991
''You know no fear.''

1649
01:41:49,067 --> 01:41:51,001
''You're cunning like a jackal.''

1650
01:41:51,069 --> 01:41:53,333
''You're the protector.''

1651
01:41:53,405 --> 01:41:56,670
''You're the king.''

1652
01:41:56,741 --> 01:42:00,438
''You're the king.''

1653
01:42:01,346 --> 01:42:02,574
chain Baskar, Acid Raja..

1654
01:42:02,647 --> 01:42:03,773
..Koli Manja, Bullet Ravi.

1655
01:42:03,848 --> 01:42:06,510
These titles have
nothing to do with what you do.

1656
01:42:06,584 --> 01:42:09,553
Stop working or Armugam.

1657
01:42:09,621 --> 01:42:10,747
Stop working for him indirectly.

1658
01:42:10,822 --> 01:42:13,052
Else I've shooting order.

1659
01:42:13,124 --> 01:42:16,150
If you continue to do the same..

1660
01:42:16,394 --> 01:42:18,487
..you will be killed.

1661
01:42:19,331 --> 01:42:23,700
''Kempe Gowda with a
terrific mustache.''

1662
01:42:27,605 --> 01:42:31,939
''Set the evil of
fire with your anger.''

1663
01:42:53,331 --> 01:42:55,492
Hello, sir.
- The guy whom you got transfer to..

1664
01:42:55,567 --> 01:42:57,535
..Magadi Road police station..

1665
01:42:57,802 --> 01:43:01,363
..I've promoted him as
assistant commissioner of police.

1666
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:05,376
Thank you, sir.
- Is he related to you very closely?

1667
01:43:05,477 --> 01:43:07,035
He's like my bother-in-law.

1668
01:43:07,078 --> 01:43:08,545
Pashupathi speaking.

1669
01:43:08,646 --> 01:43:11,410
Remember the man who took
away your uniform? - Yes.

1670
01:43:11,483 --> 01:43:14,350
He's playing carom in Indranagar.
- Playing?

1671
01:43:15,787 --> 01:43:17,345
He's reformed now.
- Move away.

1672
01:43:17,422 --> 01:43:20,858
I will provoke his anger.

1673
01:43:20,925 --> 01:43:24,088
And then, he will try to attack me.

1674
01:43:24,329 --> 01:43:25,421
Meanwhile, you shoot the video.

1675
01:43:25,497 --> 01:43:26,589
It will be our evidence.

1676
01:43:27,565 --> 01:43:28,657
Greetings.

1677
01:43:30,835 --> 01:43:33,565
I guess sir didn't
like us playing carom.

1678
01:43:33,638 --> 01:43:35,105
Let's play other game.

1679
01:43:39,511 --> 01:43:43,003
I guess sir doesn't like
us playing with tomato.

1680
01:43:43,048 --> 01:43:44,743
Let's play with eggplant.
- Eggplant?

1681
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:47,479
It wasn't an ordinary eggplant.
- Then?

1682
01:43:47,552 --> 01:43:48,849
Eggplant bomb.

1683
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:50,979
If you move your leg,
the bomb will explode.

1684
01:43:51,823 --> 01:43:54,018
Let's go.
- Please help me.

1685
01:43:54,359 --> 01:43:57,089
He says it will explode.
- I'll take a look.

1686
01:43:57,328 --> 01:43:58,920
Hurry up.
- It is just an ordinary eggplant.

1687
01:43:58,997 --> 01:44:00,931
Let's go.
- Ordinary eggplant?

1688
01:44:02,067 --> 01:44:03,398
I see.

1689
01:44:03,468 --> 01:44:06,437
Down to eggplant!

1690
01:44:06,504 --> 01:44:08,802
Down to eggplant!

1691
01:44:12,977 --> 01:44:14,376
Hello, Kempu.

1692
01:44:14,546 --> 01:44:15,740
When did you come?
- A while ago.

1693
01:44:16,448 --> 01:44:18,075
Hi, uncle.
- Hi, uncle.

1694
01:44:19,484 --> 01:44:21,008
Where is father?
- He's having a look at the house.

1695
01:44:22,754 --> 01:44:25,484
Everyone knows about your promotion.

1696
01:44:25,557 --> 01:44:29,357
Only I know about the risk.

1697
01:44:29,561 --> 01:44:32,962
Get yourself
transferred back to our village.

1698
01:44:33,031 --> 01:44:34,123
No, father.

1699
01:44:34,499 --> 01:44:37,400
I don't want to return to
village fearing ordinary goons.

1700
01:44:37,469 --> 01:44:40,905
Mr. Lion.
- Kavya, surprised to see you here.

1701
01:44:41,539 --> 01:44:43,404
I heard you'll were coming.

1702
01:44:43,575 --> 01:44:44,974
So I decided to pay a visit.

1703
01:44:45,009 --> 01:44:48,069
Who told you that we are coming?
- Your son.

1704
01:44:48,113 --> 01:44:50,104
He also didn't know
that we are coming.

1705
01:44:50,515 --> 01:44:51,846
How did you know?

1706
01:44:53,785 --> 01:44:57,653
I didn't mean when I
told you to come back.

1707
01:44:58,523 --> 01:45:01,151
You will surely attain victory.

1708
01:45:02,727 --> 01:45:04,922
until then, don't come to the village.

1709
01:45:05,663 --> 01:45:08,029
No, father. - Mom, I've work
at commissioner's office..

1710
01:45:08,099 --> 01:45:09,566
You're leaving?

1711
01:45:09,701 --> 01:45:11,032
Why don't you have food and leave?

1712
01:45:11,703 --> 01:45:13,568
Mom, I've work to do..
- Have food.

1713
01:45:13,638 --> 01:45:15,037
Pashupathi, let's go.
- I'm coming, sir.

1714
01:45:15,106 --> 01:45:16,164
Where do you live?

1715
01:45:18,076 --> 01:45:19,338
Please come.

1716
01:45:20,078 --> 01:45:21,875
come.
- Why did you bring them here?

1717
01:45:21,946 --> 01:45:23,106
I happened to go to their house.

1718
01:45:23,348 --> 01:45:25,441
They said they want to visit us.
I didn't know how to avoid them.

1719
01:45:25,517 --> 01:45:26,609
Why did he come here?

1720
01:45:27,118 --> 01:45:29,643
Do they think I'll get my
daughter married to their son?

1721
01:45:29,721 --> 01:45:31,848
Please. At least
talk to Sister Manyatha.

1722
01:45:32,056 --> 01:45:33,546
What's your name?
- Divya.

1723
01:45:33,625 --> 01:45:34,956
What do you do?
- I'm studying.

1724
01:45:35,126 --> 01:45:36,388
She's my second daughter.

1725
01:45:37,095 --> 01:45:38,357
Hello, Mahadev.

1726
01:45:38,696 --> 01:45:40,561

We arrived in the morning.

1729
01:45:49,641 --> 01:45:51,404
We are so fortunate.

1730
01:45:51,809 --> 01:45:53,003
Your daughter had come home.

1731
01:45:53,711 --> 01:45:55,474
We came with her in the car.

1732
01:45:56,948 --> 01:46:04,377
I'm very sad about the
incident at temple that day.

1733
01:46:04,822 --> 01:46:06,585
You hardly come to village.

1734
01:46:07,525 --> 01:46:10,119
He shouldn't have been rude to you.

1735
01:46:10,195 --> 01:46:13,028
After all, I'm a businessman.

1736
01:46:13,631 --> 01:46:14,928
I cannot control my anger.

1737
01:46:15,166 --> 01:46:18,101
I feel very happy to see you.

1738
01:46:20,471 --> 01:46:23,440
Are you looking for a
groom for your elder daughter?

1739
01:46:24,375 --> 01:46:27,742
You must look for very rich person.

1740
01:46:29,914 --> 01:46:31,040

1741
01:46:32,116 --> 01:46:36,849
Please.
- The groom should not only be rich.

1742
01:46:37,555 --> 01:46:40,956
But also should be well mannered.

1743
01:46:41,626 --> 01:46:49,590
Everyday we're watching rich
people attitude in medias.

1744
01:46:50,902 --> 01:46:53,769
You're aware of everything.

1745
01:46:55,006 --> 01:46:56,098
We will take your leave.
- Okay.

1746
01:46:56,174 --> 01:46:58,108
I'm also looking a bride for my son.

1747
01:46:58,610 --> 01:47:02,410
If you have any brides equal to
our status please let us know.

1748
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,445

Jignesh, drop them.
- Okay, madam.

1751
01:47:11,089 --> 01:47:13,922
Aren't they aware of
your affair with their son?

1752
01:47:14,425 --> 01:47:15,551
No, father.

1753
01:47:17,528 --> 01:47:18,859
I made a mistake.

1754
01:47:20,398 --> 01:47:23,561
I misunderstood a man who is so good.

1755
01:47:23,801 --> 01:47:25,735
I'm impressed by what he said.

1756
01:47:26,537 --> 01:47:31,133
Kavya, I promise I'll get
you married to Kempe Gowda.

1757
01:47:31,476 --> 01:47:35,640
''Turn on the radio.''

1758
01:47:35,747 --> 01:47:37,908

store is going to ours.

01:47:54,899 --> 01:47:59,359

01:49:26,524 --> 01:49:28,788
''The window is broken.''

1781
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,951
''I'll not watch you stealthily.''

1782
01:49:31,028 --> 01:49:33,519
''I will get drunk.''

1783
01:49:33,598 --> 01:49:36,431
''You're my Paro and I'm your Devdas.''

1784

Now their romance comes to and end.

1798

That's all for now. Bye.

1799
01:51:12,363 --> 01:51:13,990
Sir, she's here to meet you.

1800
01:51:14,599 --> 01:51:16,533
Tell me.
- My name is Sumathi.

1801
01:51:16,868 --> 01:51:19,701
I'm staying alone in a rented house.

1802
01:51:20,071 --> 01:51:23,598
The goons in the area are
troubling me for the two months.

1803
01:51:23,641 --> 01:51:25,108
Why didn't you lodge a
complaint at a nearby police station?

1804
01:51:25,343 --> 01:51:28,710
I'm not local. Moreover, I live alone.

1805
01:51:28,813 --> 01:51:32,078
I'm afraid of being in trouble
if I complain to the police.

1806
01:51:32,316 --> 01:51:36,116
Today, some goons got
drunk and barged into my house.

1807
01:51:36,354 --> 01:51:38,584
So, I came running to you
even without locking the door.

1808
01:51:38,656 --> 01:51:39,782
Instead of coming here..

1809
01:51:39,857 --> 01:51:41,449
..you should've report to the
police station in your area.

1810
01:51:41,526 --> 01:51:43,551
I heard that you're very nice person.

1811
01:51:43,628 --> 01:51:46,722
Women like me suffer so much.

1812
01:51:46,797 --> 01:51:48,992
People like you need to protect us.

1813
01:51:49,066 --> 01:51:51,660
Please solve my problem.

1814
01:51:53,838 --> 01:51:55,772
Please come to my house for once.

1815
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,432
Your home town?
- Mangalore.

1816
01:51:59,043 --> 01:52:00,943
Which area in Mangalore?
- Near Hampankatte.

1817
01:52:02,747 --> 01:52:04,942
Where do you work?
- Microtech Solutions.

1818
01:52:06,751 --> 01:52:08,719
Your rented house address?

1819
01:52:08,786 --> 01:52:10,913
No.12, Nruthya Grama Road, Hesargatta.

1820
01:52:10,988 --> 01:52:13,354
Don't worry. I'll come with you.
- Thank you, sir.

1821
01:52:13,991 --> 01:52:16,687
Bose, call Microteach
company and collect her details.

1822
01:52:16,761 --> 01:52:18,422
Microteach..
- I can't arrest her right away..

1823
01:52:18,496 --> 01:52:21,329
..but I want to know
who else with her.

1824
01:52:21,399 --> 01:52:23,867
Does anyone by the name
Sumathi work as a program assistant?

1825
01:52:23,935 --> 01:52:25,334
Such a person is not
working here, sir.

1826
01:52:25,403 --> 01:52:26,563
Hampankatte patrol come in.

1827
01:52:26,637 --> 01:52:28,332
No.
- No one by that name lives here.

1828
01:52:30,741 --> 01:52:32,038
She sent message saying 'on the way'.

1829
01:52:34,011 --> 01:52:35,501
Yes, Santosh?
- Sir, Bose here.

1830
01:52:35,613 --> 01:52:37,513
She has given false information.

1831
01:52:37,582 --> 01:52:38,708
Okay, Santosh. Bye.

1832
01:52:38,783 --> 01:52:40,910
Kavya, your husband to be.

1833
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:43,412
Who's the lady with him?

1834
01:52:56,534 --> 01:52:57,626
Hey. Darn it.

1835
01:53:01,072 --> 01:53:03,939
Yes, Narayan?
- Sir, I'm constable Madesh speaking.

1836
01:53:03,975 --> 01:53:06,443
There's no such girl staying
at the address you gave. - Yes.

1837
01:53:06,477 --> 01:53:08,468
The house has been
locked for sometime.

1838
01:53:08,546 --> 01:53:10,946
Five to six men came to
that house in the morning.

1839
01:53:11,015 --> 01:53:13,677
Okay, I'll meet you next year.

1840
01:53:13,918 --> 01:53:15,078
Sir, where are you taking me?

1841
01:53:15,152 --> 01:53:16,449
This is not the way to my house.

1842
01:53:22,593 --> 01:53:24,788
Stop! Don't try to escape!

1843
01:53:25,863 --> 01:53:29,822
Don't think that you
are smarter then us.

1844
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:32,801
The story you have told me..

1845
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:34,667
..is not relevant to you at all.

1846
01:53:34,739 --> 01:53:36,434
She has sent six messages until now.

1847
01:53:36,941 --> 01:53:39,739
This has nothing to do
with you. Who sent you?

1848
01:53:39,810 --> 01:53:41,004
Sir, please.
- Who sent you?

1849
01:53:41,112 --> 01:53:42,340
I don't know.
- Tell me the truth.

1850
01:53:42,513 --> 01:53:43,673
come on.

1851
01:53:43,848 --> 01:53:45,679
Are you brave enough to do it?
- Yes, sir.

1852
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:48,082
Somehow bring him there.
- Okay.

1853
01:53:48,319 --> 01:53:51,083
Our men will be ready to
shoot once he reaches the house.

1854
01:53:51,322 --> 01:53:53,085
He will die today for sure.

1855
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:10,932
This is not the girl we sent.

1856
01:54:10,975 --> 01:54:12,374
Start to shoot.
- Okay, boss.

1857
01:54:23,487 --> 01:54:24,545
Fire!

1858
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:03,952
Sir, only one.

1859
01:55:04,028 --> 01:55:05,154
Approximately, twelve feet.

1860
01:55:20,444 --> 01:55:22,139
He stole my clothes. Look for him.

1861
01:55:22,847 --> 01:55:23,939
Hey!

1862
01:55:25,449 --> 01:55:26,643
When did you come to the city?

1863
01:55:26,717 --> 01:55:29,413
I've lost something
and need to make report.

1864
01:55:29,487 --> 01:55:31,079
What you have lost?
- A pail.

1865
01:55:31,522 --> 01:55:32,716
Pail?

1866
01:55:33,124 --> 01:55:34,591
You ignored me when you're going..

1867
01:55:34,658 --> 01:55:38,389
..with a woman in your jeep.

1868
01:55:39,764 --> 01:55:42,790
I saw you following
me taking a u-turn.

1869
01:55:43,033 --> 01:55:44,796
I never stopped at the traffic light..

1870
01:55:45,069 --> 01:55:46,127
..but you had to.

1871
01:55:46,370 --> 01:55:47,928
So, you intentionally avoided me.

1872
01:55:48,405 --> 01:55:49,463
You were a very good
guy back in village..

1873
01:55:49,540 --> 01:55:51,007
..and here you're being
totally opposite. How dare you?

1874
01:55:51,108 --> 01:55:52,370
Yes.
- Thank you, sir.

1875
01:55:52,810 --> 01:55:53,868
The news has been published.

1876
01:55:53,978 --> 01:55:55,070
Give it to her. Let
she read it herself.

1877
01:55:55,379 --> 01:55:57,643
The news about the pail..
- Pashu.. - Okay, sir.

1878
01:55:58,048 --> 01:55:59,140
Take it.

1879
01:56:02,453 --> 01:56:04,011
There was a big gun
fight with a wanted..

1880
01:56:04,088 --> 01:56:05,180
..group in the morning.

1881
01:56:05,422 --> 01:56:06,650
Read it.
- Out!

1882
01:56:06,957 --> 01:56:08,049
About turn.

1883
01:56:08,659 --> 01:56:09,717
I went there because of a problem..

1884
01:56:10,461 --> 01:56:11,951
..and you were following me.

1885
01:56:12,763 --> 01:56:16,563
How'll I protect you if
you keep following me?

1886
01:56:16,767 --> 01:56:18,064
Stop suspecting.

1887
01:56:18,135 --> 01:56:23,630
I don't suspect you. It's
all because of my friend.

1888
01:56:25,442 --> 01:56:26,932
You try avoid her first.

1889
01:56:27,845 --> 01:56:29,779
And now, stand away from me.

1890
01:56:29,847 --> 01:56:31,075
Why should I?

1891
01:56:31,949 --> 01:56:33,780
Father has given his
consent for our marriage.

1892
01:56:33,851 --> 01:56:39,380
The staff will get to
watch things happening inside.

1893
01:56:41,425 --> 01:56:42,551
Did everyone get
killed in the encounter?

1894
01:56:42,626 --> 01:56:43,923
One has been hospitalized.

1895
01:56:43,994 --> 01:56:45,621
He has agreed to
become approver. Okay?

1896
01:56:47,064 --> 01:56:49,498
Brother, Manohar is
ready to give statement.

1897
01:56:49,567 --> 01:56:52,434
He is concern about his life now.

1898
01:56:52,837 --> 01:56:54,361
He's more like a brother to me.

1899
01:56:54,538 --> 01:56:56,802
He was like your brother,
but I'm your real brother.

1900
01:56:56,874 --> 01:56:58,705
I cannot tolerate to see you tensed.

1901
01:56:58,809 --> 01:56:59,969
I will deal with him.

1902
01:57:13,557 --> 01:57:15,548
How many times you kill
the one who's already dead?

1903
01:57:15,626 --> 01:57:16,786
He died twelve hours ago.

1904
01:57:18,329 --> 01:57:21,321
This is 9 mm caliber
gun and 3 mm bullet.

1905
01:57:21,465 --> 01:57:23,330
I'm very sure that..

1906
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:24,799
..he died before the
fourth bullet hit him.

1907
01:57:24,869 --> 01:57:27,463
Only few will help
criminals like you.

1908
01:57:27,972 --> 01:57:32,875
Others will always help..

1909
01:57:32,977 --> 01:57:35,537
..police to carry their task.

1910
01:57:35,746 --> 01:57:40,149
You wanted to kill through a woman.

1911
01:57:40,751 --> 01:57:42,116
Now, I will kill you.

1912
01:57:42,353 --> 01:57:44,082
He's trapped now. Am I right?

1913
01:57:45,155 --> 01:57:46,383
Don't kill me.

1914
01:57:46,457 --> 01:57:47,583
You were here to kill him, right?

1915
01:57:47,658 --> 01:57:49,785
Kill him.
- Let me go.- Kill him.

1916
01:57:50,127 --> 01:57:51,355
Kill him!

1917
01:57:53,530 --> 01:57:54,724
Why did you change your mind?

1918
01:57:54,798 --> 01:57:55,890
Bose.
- Sir.

1919
01:57:55,966 --> 01:57:57,024
You kill him.

1920
01:58:00,938 --> 01:58:02,735
How do you do that?

1921
01:58:02,806 --> 01:58:04,398
I used to scare
students in the college..

1922
01:58:04,575 --> 01:58:05,803
..before joining the police force.

1923
01:58:06,710 --> 01:58:07,870
It's your brother.

1924
01:58:07,912 --> 01:58:08,970
What is it?

1925
01:58:09,079 --> 01:58:10,546
Don't do anything to my brother.

1926
01:58:10,614 --> 01:58:11,706
I'll ask him to surrender.

1927
01:58:11,782 --> 01:58:13,841
You want me to arrest him
and offer food for free?

1928
01:58:13,918 --> 01:58:16,386
I'm not a fool to do that.

1929
01:58:16,453 --> 01:58:19,513
Don't do anything to him. Then
admit that you kidnapped 55 people.

1930
01:58:19,590 --> 01:58:20,921
Are you kidding?
- You can't do that, right?

1931
01:58:21,358 --> 01:58:22,757
Then, listen to what I say.

1932
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:26,123
Get your brother's corpse
released from the hospital.

1933
01:58:26,997 --> 01:58:29,761
He attacked the police
when they tried to..

1934
01:58:29,833 --> 01:58:32,097
..stop him from killing the witness.

1935
01:58:32,336 --> 01:58:33,428
Don't kill him.

1936
01:58:33,504 --> 01:58:36,530
They had to shoot him in
order to protect themselves.

1937
01:58:36,573 --> 01:58:38,370
Don't kill him. He
has wife and children.

1938
01:58:38,475 --> 01:58:40,443
Don't other men in
Karnataka have wife and children?

1939
01:59:08,472 --> 01:59:09,734
I didn't run over him.

1940
01:59:09,807 --> 01:59:11,968
What happened?
- Darling!

1941
01:59:14,511 --> 01:59:16,103
catch her!

1942
01:59:36,033 --> 01:59:39,730
Yes, Kavya?
- Hello. Goons are after me.

1943
01:59:39,803 --> 01:59:42,033
Kavya?
- I've locked the shutter.

1944
01:59:42,106 --> 01:59:43,869
Break the shutter.

1945
01:59:44,475 --> 01:59:46,136
Faster.
- I'm very scared.

1946
01:59:46,377 --> 01:59:47,435
Bring the petrol.

1947
01:59:48,779 --> 01:59:49,871
They're pouring petrol.

1948
01:59:49,947 --> 01:59:52,848
Don't cry.
- I don't know what to do.

1949
01:59:52,916 --> 01:59:54,543
Is there a car inside?
- Yes.

1950
01:59:54,785 --> 01:59:56,582
On the lighter.

1951
01:59:58,589 --> 01:59:59,749
Look if there's is a paper.

1952
02:00:00,057 --> 02:00:01,115
Light it up.

1953
02:00:01,658 --> 02:00:03,626
It's not burning.-Blow it, it will.

1954
02:00:05,829 --> 02:00:07,558
It's burning now.-Throw
it towards the petrol.

1955
02:00:10,467 --> 02:00:12,128
Break the shutter.

1956
02:00:12,369 --> 02:00:14,098
Don't be afraid. Sit in the car.

1957
02:00:14,171 --> 02:00:15,638
Don't take a left turn..

1958
02:00:15,706 --> 02:00:17,640
..but take a right turn as
soon as you come out of the gate.

1959
02:00:19,943 --> 02:00:21,638
Kav..

1960
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:24,342
Faster.

1961
02:00:31,422 --> 02:00:33,686
Kavya! Ambulance!

1962
02:00:33,857 --> 02:00:35,916
Where is the doctor?
- We will take care of her.

1963
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:44,533
No matter what happens..

1964
02:00:46,937 --> 02:00:47,995
..don't spare him.

1965
02:00:48,472 --> 02:00:49,700
We're with you.

1966
02:00:50,074 --> 02:00:52,941
You must do what you got to do.

1967
02:01:05,389 --> 02:01:07,084
Bring his phone.
- Okay.

1968
02:01:07,591 --> 02:01:08,717
Yes, Bose?
- Not Bose.

1969
02:01:08,792 --> 02:01:10,384
I took this phone from road side.

1970
02:01:10,661 --> 02:01:12,424
Where did you find the phone?
- Banaswadi, sir.

1971
02:01:12,496 --> 02:01:13,622
No, no, no.

1972
02:01:13,697 --> 02:01:14,755
Madiwala.

1973
02:01:15,699 --> 02:01:16,688
Malleshwaram, sir.

1974
02:01:16,767 --> 02:01:18,632
If I tell you I'm in Banaswadi,
Madiwala..

1975
02:01:18,702 --> 02:01:20,727
..Malleshwaram, will
you be able to find me?

1976
02:01:20,804 --> 02:01:22,362
You will destroy my kingdom?

1977
02:01:23,507 --> 02:01:26,840
Your Bose is lying
dead in Gandhi Nagar.

1978
02:01:26,910 --> 02:01:29,879
Go and collect his body.

1979
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:39,989
I'll finish everyone
who related to you.

1980
02:01:40,057 --> 02:01:41,615
Keep collecting their dead bodies.

1981
02:01:41,692 --> 02:01:42,886
You won't even have time to cry.

1982
02:01:45,362 --> 02:01:46,852
Tell Pashupathi to go to the
village and be with my parents.

1983
02:01:46,930 --> 02:01:48,090
Inform father not to go to
the store until I tell him.

1984
02:01:48,432 --> 02:01:49,558
Leave.
- Okay, sir.

1985
02:01:50,367 --> 02:01:51,664
D.I.G and commissioner are coming

1986
02:01:51,735 --> 02:01:52,895
constables please be outside.

1987
02:01:55,706 --> 02:01:56,764
What's happening, Mr. Kempe Gowda.

1988
02:01:58,342 --> 02:01:59,673
You're the chief of
anti-kidnap force.

1989
02:01:59,843 --> 02:02:00,935
What were you doing so long?

1990
02:02:01,979 --> 02:02:04,573
We were preventing
any further kidnaps.

1991
02:02:04,648 --> 02:02:06,673
Do you know who the culprit is?
- Yes, sir.

1992
02:02:06,750 --> 02:02:07,842
Then why didn't you take action?

1993
02:02:07,918 --> 02:02:09,909
Who's he?
- Armugam, sir.

1994
02:02:09,987 --> 02:02:13,388
Who told you?
- Within any hesitation he told me..

1995
02:02:13,891 --> 02:02:16,621
..it was he who
kidnapped all the 55 people.

1996
02:02:16,793 --> 02:02:17,953
Then why didn't you arrest him?

1997
02:02:18,028 --> 02:02:19,552
He doesn't get
directly involved I any crime.

1998
02:02:20,664 --> 02:02:25,966
There are many to take
charge for any crime..

1999
02:02:26,036 --> 02:02:28,800
..he does for mere money.

2000
02:02:29,106 --> 02:02:30,630
Armugam is a notorious goon.

2001
02:02:30,741 --> 02:02:32,732
He's doing some harsh
real activities.

2002
02:02:32,943 --> 02:02:34,604
But kidnapping, I doubt.

2003
02:02:34,645 --> 02:02:36,977
He has been getting away
because of this trust.

2004
02:02:37,447 --> 02:02:38,539
Bose!

2005
02:02:41,652 --> 02:02:42,744
One second, sir.

2006
02:02:45,856 --> 02:02:47,050
Here's the full
information of this case.

2007
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:49,915
He's related to every
detail in this file.

2008
02:02:50,460 --> 02:02:51,859
But there no evidence.
- So, what do we do now?

2009
02:02:52,029 --> 02:02:53,360
Encounter, sir.

2010
02:02:53,964 --> 02:02:55,056
What you are saying?

2011
02:02:55,132 --> 02:02:58,033
He has stopped his illegal
business due to my torture so far.

2012
02:02:58,569 --> 02:03:00,764
We must finish him before
his fear towards us fades.

2013
02:03:00,938 --> 02:03:03,099
Mr. Kempe Gowda, talk
like a police officer.

2014
02:03:03,340 --> 02:03:07,333
Just give me your signal,
I'll finish him off.

2015
02:03:07,544 --> 02:03:09,876
I will personally face
all the case after that.

2016
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:12,014
Lot of parent's will be happy then.

2017
02:03:12,482 --> 02:03:13,779
I feel very sad.

2018
02:03:13,984 --> 02:03:15,542
I feel so
embarrassed for not able to..

2019
02:03:15,886 --> 02:03:18,650
..detain the criminal
even after I know him.

2020
02:03:18,722 --> 02:03:20,451
Don't be emotional.

2021
02:03:20,624 --> 02:03:21,784
Get ready with the evidence.

2022
02:03:21,858 --> 02:03:24,691
It is impossible until we have
officers like him in our department.

2023
02:03:27,564 --> 02:03:29,429
Give me your phone.
- Why you asking his phone?

2024
02:03:29,499 --> 02:03:32,935
The evidence you're
looking for is inside it.

2025
02:03:33,003 --> 02:03:34,493
Mr. Shankar, give him your phone.

2026
02:03:34,972 --> 02:03:36,064
Phone, please.

2027
02:03:37,741 --> 02:03:38,833
Take a look, sir.

2028
02:03:38,942 --> 02:03:40,500
The call has been
disconnected just 20 seconds back.

2029
02:03:40,611 --> 02:03:44,047
Armugam was listening to our
conversation for the past 30 minutes.

2030
02:03:44,381 --> 02:03:46,747
He'd called me a while ago.

2031
02:03:47,317 --> 02:03:48,978
I forgot to disconnect the call.

2032
02:03:51,922 --> 02:03:54,117
This is the billing detail of his
number for the past three months.

2033
02:03:54,791 --> 02:03:57,692
He calls Armugam twenty times a day.

2034
02:03:58,428 --> 02:04:00,419
We need to enquire him in
order to solve this case.

2035
02:04:00,497 --> 02:04:01,555
Take him to your custody.

2036
02:04:06,069 --> 02:04:07,559
Please go out.
- Yes, sir.

2037
02:04:13,744 --> 02:04:16,611
Take this, sir. This is
the file related to you.

2038
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:17,972
Your phone.

2039
02:04:18,415 --> 02:04:21,543
There's no complaint or
enquiry commission on you.

2040
02:04:22,386 --> 02:04:25,378
It's like humiliating the entire
police department if I enquire you.

2041
02:04:26,490 --> 02:04:28,014
I'm sure you got this
job with great effort.

2042
02:04:28,492 --> 02:04:29,891
You would've taken this
job to achieve something.

2043
02:04:30,694 --> 02:04:33,595
You're placed here
like any other criminals.

2044
02:04:35,599 --> 02:04:36,725
It really painful.

2045
02:04:37,167 --> 02:04:41,900
Your family will be very upset..

2046
02:04:42,739 --> 02:04:43,899
..if they learn that
you were working..

2047
02:04:44,174 --> 02:04:50,841
..for Armugam and if
you're put to shame in public.

2048
02:04:54,418 --> 02:04:56,045
Never.

2049
02:04:56,753 --> 02:05:00,189
Will you spare Armugam if
he kidnapped your daughter?

2050
02:05:01,558 --> 02:05:06,188
For sure you will shoot him.

2051
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:13,858
There's no history of
anyone lived in peace..

2052
02:05:14,471 --> 02:05:16,063
..doing illegal business.

2053
02:05:16,940 --> 02:05:18,771
Dignity is more important than money.

2054
02:05:18,842 --> 02:05:23,472
Not everyone is fortunate
to get what you received.

2055
02:05:26,083 --> 02:05:29,814
I know how to deal with Armugam.
You may go, sir.

2056
02:05:29,886 --> 02:05:33,686
Kempe Gowda. Please forgive me.

2057
02:05:33,757 --> 02:05:34,917
I've have a family.

2058
02:05:35,125 --> 02:05:39,118
I helped him for the greed of money.

2059
02:05:39,830 --> 02:05:42,958
Give me the gun, I will kill him.

2060
02:05:44,701 --> 02:05:48,637
No, sir.
- I want to do something.

2061
02:05:49,373 --> 02:05:50,499
Please, Kempe Gowda.

2062
02:05:53,076 --> 02:05:54,373
Just tell a lie.

2063
02:05:57,147 --> 02:05:59,172
Armugam kidnapped my daughter.

2064
02:05:59,549 --> 02:06:01,847
What are you saying? - There has
been four crank calls from him.

2065
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:04,682
Hello.
- Well, sir..

2066
02:06:04,755 --> 02:06:06,052
Please believe me.

2067
02:06:06,123 --> 02:06:09,923
What are you saying?
- I didn't kidnap this girl.

2068
02:06:09,993 --> 02:06:11,824
That means you were the
one who kidnapped others?

2069
02:06:11,895 --> 02:06:14,159
Yes, I'm the one who
kidnapped 55 people.

2070
02:06:14,398 --> 02:06:17,561
I used the ransom to
fund your political party.

2071
02:06:17,634 --> 02:06:20,398
Are all your party members honest?

2072
02:06:20,470 --> 02:06:22,131
How dare you talk to me like that?

2073
02:06:22,372 --> 02:06:25,864
Please save me.
- Stay on the line.

2074
02:06:27,677 --> 02:06:29,975
Sir.
- Armugam is on the line.

2075
02:06:31,047 --> 02:06:32,480
This is what you going to do.

2076
02:06:32,783 --> 02:06:34,080
Arrest him within 24 hours..

2077
02:06:34,518 --> 02:06:38,386
..and bring him in front of me.

2078
02:06:38,622 --> 02:06:39,714
understand?
- Sir.

2079
02:06:40,724 --> 02:06:41,816
Are you out of your mind?

2080
02:06:42,058 --> 02:06:47,086
I can't help you any more.
- Don't mess with me.

2081
02:06:47,164 --> 02:06:48,392
Disconnect the call.

2082
02:06:56,072 --> 02:06:58,404
Are you happy that she's alive?

2083
02:06:58,475 --> 02:07:01,103
You and the home minister
are trying to finish me?

2084
02:07:01,878 --> 02:07:05,439
I'll kidnap home
minister's daughter at 10 a.m.

2085
02:07:05,515 --> 02:07:07,881
Hey..
- I will create disaster.

2086
02:07:11,455 --> 02:07:12,547
Sir.
- Sir.

2087
02:07:12,789 --> 02:07:14,848
We've tighten the
security at all the check posts.

2088
02:07:14,925 --> 02:07:16,825
Sir.
- His family is under our protection.

2089
02:07:16,893 --> 02:07:17,985
But I think he's fooling us.

2090
02:07:19,796 --> 02:07:22,424
You think everything
is in your control?

2091
02:07:22,499 --> 02:07:25,127
Just watch how I will
kidnap the girl at 10 a.m.

2092
02:07:27,337 --> 02:07:30,465
You think its impossible
if the girl is with you?

2093
02:07:30,674 --> 02:07:33,643
I've placed my people over there.

2094
02:07:36,446 --> 02:07:37,572
Mouli!
- Sir?

2095
02:07:37,647 --> 02:07:38,909
He's insane. He can do anything.

2096
02:07:38,982 --> 02:07:40,142
Arrange security to
all the ministers.

2097
02:07:40,383 --> 02:07:41,475
come in control.

2098
02:07:42,419 --> 02:07:45,513
It's time to show who I am.

2099
02:07:45,589 --> 02:07:47,454
All squad in position!

2100
02:07:47,524 --> 02:07:49,082
I have kidnapped the girl.

2101
02:07:50,627 --> 02:07:54,085
You're in Karnataka home
minister c. Ashoka Kumar's house.

2102
02:07:54,164 --> 02:07:57,133
I've kidnapped Tamilnadu
home minister's daughter.

2103
02:07:57,667 --> 02:07:59,532
She's studying
engineering in Bangalore.

2104
02:07:59,603 --> 02:08:01,503
I kidnap her from the college.

2105
02:08:01,571 --> 02:08:02,833
How is it?

2106
02:08:02,906 --> 02:08:04,601
Listen to me carefully.

2107
02:08:04,875 --> 02:08:08,777
I want to go to
Mangalore without any obstacles.

2108
02:08:08,812 --> 02:08:11,975
I want your policemen to protect me.

2109
02:08:12,582 --> 02:08:16,074
Also get ready for me
a boat at Mangalore.

2110
02:08:16,152 --> 02:08:17,847
This girl will be with me..

2111
02:08:17,921 --> 02:08:19,320
..until I reach Dubai in that boat.

2112
02:08:19,656 --> 02:08:22,784
I'm sure you're aware
of the consequences..

2113
02:08:22,859 --> 02:08:24,349
..if something happens to this girl.

2114
02:08:24,427 --> 02:08:27,453
Take care of my safety if
you want her to be alive.

2115
02:08:27,531 --> 02:08:28,623
understand?

2116
02:08:29,432 --> 02:08:31,024
This is Tamilnadu
D.I.G Nithyavel speaking.

2117
02:08:31,101 --> 02:08:32,830
We are trying our best.

2118
02:08:34,771 --> 02:08:36,568
Over.
- Alert the coastguards. Over.

2119
02:08:37,674 --> 02:08:39,642
Follow Armugam
without any disturbance.

2120
02:08:41,578 --> 02:08:42,875
Kempe Gowda is following our car.

2121
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:47,338
Kempe Gowda, I know
you are following me.

2122
02:08:47,417 --> 02:08:49,009
You want her to be killed?

2123
02:08:49,853 --> 02:08:50,911
Turn right.

2124
02:08:56,159 --> 02:08:57,524
Sir.
- Yes?

2125
02:08:57,594 --> 02:08:59,027
As expected, we were
unable to follow his car.

2126
02:08:59,095 --> 02:09:00,653
So, I will get to
Mangalore by helicopter.

2127
02:09:00,730 --> 02:09:03,130
Armugam has to cross a bridge
before getting to Panamboor.

2128
02:09:03,366 --> 02:09:04,799
There are road humps
before getting to the bridge.

2129
02:09:05,001 --> 02:09:06,559
As our first security car passes by..

2130
02:09:06,636 --> 02:09:08,126
..we'll puncture Armugam's car.

2131
02:09:08,371 --> 02:09:10,396
As they get down from the car..

2132
02:09:10,507 --> 02:09:12,407
..our standby squad can fire
at them and save the girl.

2133
02:09:12,609 --> 02:09:13,701
What is something happens
to the girl?

2134
02:09:13,777 --> 02:09:15,802
He'll not release the girl
once he gets onto the boat.

2135
02:09:15,879 --> 02:09:17,642
So, we're taking the risk. But,
we will save the girl.

2136
02:09:17,814 --> 02:09:19,475
Send the commanders to
the bridge. Over. - Over.

2137
02:09:19,783 --> 02:09:21,512
What if Armugam doesn't
get down from his car?

2138
02:09:21,585 --> 02:09:22,552
Sir, just a second. Hello?

2139
02:09:22,619 --> 02:09:24,746
Kavya wants to talk to you.
- Okay.

2140
02:09:25,021 --> 02:09:26,113
Take it.

2141
02:09:26,723 --> 02:09:27,815
Hello.
- Yes, Kavya?

2142
02:09:27,891 --> 02:09:28,949
You be brave.

2143
02:09:29,459 --> 02:09:31,791
I should've listened to you.

2144
02:09:31,861 --> 02:09:33,920
It's my mistake.

2145
02:09:34,698 --> 02:09:36,996
I followed your
instructions correctly.

2146
02:09:37,601 --> 02:09:42,971
You asked me to turn right,
but I turned left.

2147
02:09:43,373 --> 02:09:45,364
What are you saying?
- That's why I got shot.

2148
02:09:46,343 --> 02:09:47,970
Nothing to worry about it.
You take care of yourself.

2149
02:09:48,745 --> 02:09:49,769
Bye.

2150
02:09:50,013 --> 02:09:51,378
You asked me what if he's doesn't..

2151
02:09:51,448 --> 02:09:52,540
..get down from the car, right?
- Yes, sir.

2152
02:09:52,616 --> 02:09:54,083
Did anyone see him inside the car?
- No.

2153
02:09:54,150 --> 02:09:55,708
Darn it. call his personal number.
- Yes, sir.

2154
02:09:56,052 --> 02:09:57,417
It says non reachable in Telugu.

2155
02:09:57,487 --> 02:09:58,818
How it's possible to hear
customer care voice in Telugu?

2156
02:09:58,888 --> 02:10:00,480
call the customer care and
collect the details of that number.

2157
02:10:00,557 --> 02:10:02,354
Make it fast.
- Hello. Good morning, sir.

2158
02:10:02,425 --> 02:10:03,983
Inform immediately.
- Yes, sir. Armugam's number ..

2159
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:05,493
..is detected
traveling near chitoor, Andhra.

2160
02:10:05,562 --> 02:10:06,756
Half an hour before
it was in Bangarpet.

2161
02:10:06,830 --> 02:10:08,092
And left Whitefield one hour ago.

2162
02:10:08,164 --> 02:10:09,688
I will call and try
to trace the number.

2163
02:10:09,766 --> 02:10:11,028
We are leaving in five minutes.
- Yes, sir.

2164
02:10:11,835 --> 02:10:12,927
Hello, sir.

2165
02:10:14,070 --> 02:10:15,162
Trace the call.
- Yes, sir.

2166
02:10:16,906 --> 02:10:19,306
Tell me. - I never
followed you as per you order.

2167
02:10:19,342 --> 02:10:22,106
The girl is important to us.
- You are nothing now.

2168
02:10:22,312 --> 02:10:24,439
Don't talk much. Hand up.

2169
02:10:24,514 --> 02:10:25,606
Just play is voice only.

2170
02:10:25,682 --> 02:10:29,345
'You are nothing now.
Don't talk much.'

2171
02:10:29,419 --> 02:10:31,011
'Hand up.'
- Sounds like a train.

2172
02:10:31,454 --> 02:10:32,785
So, he's traveling by train.

2173
02:10:42,332 --> 02:10:44,061
I'm sure he..
- Okay.

2174
02:10:44,134 --> 02:10:49,333
Someone stopped the train
which left from Bangalore station.

2175
02:10:49,406 --> 02:10:50,634
The train is late by five minutes.

2176
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:52,137
It's should be them.

2177
02:10:52,375 --> 02:10:53,672
Inform Andhra police.
- Yes, sir.

2178
02:10:53,743 --> 02:10:55,472
Tell them to search the train.
- Okay, sir.

2179
02:10:55,545 --> 02:10:57,775
Sir, I will take your leave.
- All the best.

2180
02:10:57,847 --> 02:10:58,939
Start the chopper.
- Okay, sir.

2181
02:11:00,417 --> 02:11:02,476
E-mail the picture of the girl
and Armugam to Andhra police.

2182
02:11:02,552 --> 02:11:04,110
call me after the confirmation. Go.

2183
02:11:13,530 --> 02:11:14,622
Quick! Move!

2184
02:11:18,702 --> 02:11:20,567
Should I supply lunch?
- No.

2185
02:11:20,637 --> 02:11:21,968
I will come again in Nelloor.
- Okay.

2186
02:11:26,609 --> 02:11:27,906
That's the train we have to follow.
- Sir.

2187
02:11:29,012 --> 02:11:30,036
Sir, have a look.

2188
02:11:30,547 --> 02:11:31,639
It is confirmed.

2189
02:11:32,916 --> 02:11:34,645
Sheshadri express
next station chitoor.

2190
02:11:39,556 --> 02:11:40,955
Five minutes left for
the train to arrive.

2191
02:12:00,076 --> 02:12:01,338
When we can start it?

2192
02:12:01,444 --> 02:12:02,468
He is under our surveillance.

2193
02:12:02,545 --> 02:12:03,978
We'll start it once we
know his destination.

2194
02:12:07,784 --> 02:12:09,012
The train is slowing down.

2195
02:12:11,354 --> 02:12:13,447
How far is Nellur from here?
- About 5-6 kms.

2196
02:12:15,391 --> 02:12:16,449
Let's go.

2197
02:12:19,362 --> 02:12:21,830
come on.

2198
02:12:24,901 --> 02:12:25,993
Please let go off me!

2199
02:12:35,845 --> 02:12:37,540
Is everything ready?
- Yes.

2200
02:12:37,614 --> 02:12:38,672
Greetings, boss.
- No one here.

2201
02:12:38,748 --> 02:12:40,045
This area is controlled
by Peddaraidu.

2202
02:12:40,116 --> 02:12:41,378
We drove everyone away.

2203
02:12:42,485 --> 02:12:43,918
The plan which we were
supposed to execute in Mangalore..

2204
02:12:43,987 --> 02:12:45,113
..will probably be executed here.

2205
02:12:45,522 --> 02:12:46,648
Both of you stay here three of
us will go into the village.

2206
02:12:46,723 --> 02:12:48,452
They are more in number. I know.

2207
02:12:48,892 --> 02:12:50,860
But I want someone to be
alive to save the girl.

2208
02:12:53,963 --> 02:12:56,864
No phone signal here. You see
the three tube lights there?

2209
02:12:56,933 --> 02:12:59,026
Yes, sir. If any problem,
I will shoot at it.

2210
02:12:59,435 --> 02:13:00,527
Immediately come in.
- Okay, sir.

2211
02:13:00,603 --> 02:13:02,332
Don't worry, boss.

2212
02:13:02,772 --> 02:13:04,364
I don't know how many
of us will return alive.

2213
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:05,737
Make sure the one who
survives will save the girl.

2214
02:13:05,775 --> 02:13:06,833
Yes, sir.
- Don't let the villagers see us.

2215
02:13:06,943 --> 02:13:09,434
Fire only if necessary.
- Okay, sir.

2216
02:14:38,768 --> 02:14:39,860
Get him!

2217
02:15:07,764 --> 02:15:08,924
Don't kill me, sir.

2218
02:15:08,998 --> 02:15:12,126
Don't kill me.
- I did tell you. You didn't reform.

2219
02:15:12,201 --> 02:15:13,429
Don't kill me, sir.

2220
02:15:24,714 --> 02:15:25,772
Hey!
- Let go!

2221
02:15:26,449 --> 02:15:27,507
Let go!

2222
02:15:28,451 --> 02:15:29,509
Where are you?

2223
02:15:31,054 --> 02:15:32,112
Where are you?

2224
02:15:32,922 --> 02:15:34,014
come on.

2225
02:15:36,592 --> 02:15:37,650
come on.

2226
02:15:50,974 --> 02:15:53,067
Let go!
- Shut up!

2227
02:16:11,661 --> 02:16:12,753
come on!

2228
02:16:15,898 --> 02:16:17,889
You followed me until here.

2229
02:16:17,967 --> 02:16:20,629
Are you counting how
many bullets I shot?

2230
02:16:20,870 --> 02:16:22,667
This magazine contains 12 bullets.

2231
02:16:22,739 --> 02:16:24,468
There's one more left.

2232
02:16:24,540 --> 02:16:27,134
Don't make me as a beast.

2233
02:16:27,443 --> 02:16:29,775
come out! come out!

2234
02:16:29,979 --> 02:16:31,640
I know you're around.

2235
02:16:33,549 --> 02:16:34,607
come out!

2236
02:16:45,161 --> 02:16:47,789
Let me go. You better go back.

2237
02:16:47,864 --> 02:16:50,560
I'll let her go. - You're
telling the same thing out of fear.

2238
02:16:50,633 --> 02:16:54,865
Tell something else. She's
not my relative to rescue her.

2239
02:16:55,405 --> 02:16:58,602
I came here to kill you,
not to rescue her.

2240
02:16:59,008 --> 02:17:00,908
Why I need to wait
until you shoot her.

2241
02:17:00,977 --> 02:17:02,467
I will shoot her myself.

2242
02:17:15,825 --> 02:17:17,053
Don't be afraid. You'll be okay.

2243
02:17:17,427 --> 02:17:18,860
What happened, sir?
- It was I who shot her.

2244
02:17:18,928 --> 02:17:20,623
Take her to the hospital immediately.

2245
02:17:20,997 --> 02:17:22,965
Shoot anyone who comes across. Go.

2246
02:18:22,959 --> 02:18:25,519

2247
02:18:26,462 --> 02:18:28,555

2248
02:19:44,574 --> 02:19:46,974

2250
02:19:49,779 --> 02:19:53,681
It's always been my dream to
open a grocery store I my village.

2251
02:19:54,350 --> 02:19:55,977
Please don't get me wrong.

2252
02:19:56,819 --> 02:19:57,877
