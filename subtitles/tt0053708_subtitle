1
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:37,053
Here comes India, our India!

2
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,931
We endured a lot of
troubles to see you...

3
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,534
so that, we could live
for this very moment!

4
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,604
- Whom do you have here?
- Everyone!

5
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:58,149
My mother father,
brother live here.

6
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,555
- And he...
- Who?..Your husband?

7
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,620
When did you get married?

8
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:10,627
Thousands of years back,
in my last birth.

9
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,625
We were not strangers
in our own country then.

10
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:20,965
In the year 1947, when the human
race had not turned into monsters...

11
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,643
and everyone led the same life.

12
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,705
My anklets ring with
a chime of anxiety...

13
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:43,050
wonder whom my heart is awaiting?

14
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:46,854
This is called
the spring of youth

15
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,437
The spring is here
with it's adornments...

16
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,787
this radiance has brought
happiness in our lives

17
00:04:54,995 --> 00:05:00,058
The excited breeze kisses
the flower laden trees

18
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:03,464
The branches of flowers
bow down with love

19
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:54,177
Wait there mister,
what is the hurry?

20
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:02,785
Why do you wish to fly
like a gust of wind?

21
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:11,198
My anklets ring with
a chime of anxiety...

22
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:15,206
wonder whom my heart is awaiting?

23
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,869
This is called
the spring of youth

24
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:26,875
Oh, God!

25
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,231
Brute!...Impudent...Beast!!

26
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:48,503
Everyone praises their own things
but yet brother, I'd like to say...

27
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,901
my Shanti is very docile.

28
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,247
You are back, my child?
Greet him.

29
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,921
Please have this cake, Rai Sahab.
Why hasn't Keval yet come?

30
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,251
He must be on his way...

31
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,189
you know Lalaji, this is Lahore...

32
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,922
there are various obstacles
on the way, in this town.

33
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:15,260
He has come to see you! Rai Sahab
is a very rich man from Lahore.

34
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:18,269
And why are you dressed like this?
Come on, change your dress quickly!

35
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,269
Mother, I met a beast on the way.

36
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,866
Wonder when these men
in Lahore will improve?

37
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,217
- Hello.
- God bless you, son.

38
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,285
Why were you so late, Keval?

39
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:41,292
Father, I met a crazy girl
on the way.

40
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,889
God save us from
these girls in Lahore.

41
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,962
One of them almost
stifled me today.

42
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,900
He is very outspoken.

43
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:53,965
Have tea, son....Rai Sahab, I heard
you've got a bungalow in Model Town?

44
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,300
Right, I want Keval to shift
there after marriage.

45
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,572
He will be settled there and
I will be free in my own house.

46
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,974
But Lalaji, my friends say
that the times are changing...

47
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,313
wonder what may happen tomorrow?
- What can happen, Rai Sahab?

48
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,349
Why are you standing,
sit down, child.

49
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,293
Come Rai Sahab, let us go outside.

50
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,970
Alright, let's go.

51
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,299
Sister, come,
let me show you my house.

52
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,988
You stopped so soon? We have
a long journey together.

53
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:22,394
Listen...before you go, I want
you to answer one question.

54
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,430
Hey! You crushed
something under your feet!

55
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,035
- What?
- A poor man's heart!

56
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,443
You finally did smile
under some pretext.

57
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,713
Tonight is our nuptial night...

58
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,452
and to solemnize this night,
I got this ring...

59
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,251
What happened to the light?

60
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:32,125
It will be back...Anyway, this room
is alight with your radiance.

61
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,788
The light is back.

62
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,738
No, the light will
never come back again!

63
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,739
And this light will bring
darkness in our life.

64
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:52,477
Man has turned into beast! Half
of Lahore is burning today!

65
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,083
- I am scared!
- Don't be afraid!

66
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:01,157
Don't worry, I am with you.
Look, what I have got for you!

67
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,416
Show me your hand.

68
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,423
I will always protect you.

69
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,162
But when the time came
to protect me...

70
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:17,101
he had left for Delhi,
with his father's gold...

71
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:23,509
I don't know if you've remembered
me even once in the past 5 years.

72
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,113
I don't know if I am alive
or dead for you!

73
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,519
No, my heart says that she is alive!

74
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,786
And one day, she will
surely come here!

75
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:39,188
Forget it Keval, since past 5 years,
you are saying the same thing.

76
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,323
I am fed up of hearing
the same thing, son.

77
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,192
Has anyone risen from the dead?

78
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,197
Only God knows what the poor girl
must have endured in past 5 years.

79
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,541
What must she be thinking about me?

80
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:56,546
I loved her...I made
a promise to her...

81
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,479
I promised to protect her.

82
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,548
Forget your love and promise!

83
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,817
A wedding of one month
cannot be called a marriage.

84
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,483
I suggest you forget about her,
nothing is yet lost.

85
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:08,888
People come with
new proposals everyday.

86
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,823
Father, how can you
think like that?

87
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,167
Keval, I am a human being, not God!

88
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,161
Rai Bahadur Dinanath spoke regarding
this matter in the club, yesterday...

89
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,506
he has earned a lot of money
in his business...

90
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,843
he has only one daughter
and will give a hefty dowry.

91
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,573
Enough father,
I cannot hear further!

92
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,595
Hello Rai Sahab, tell me?

93
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:49,862
Some girls have come from Pakistan
and their names are published...

94
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,865
and one of the names is
of your daughter in law.

95
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,599
My daughter in law?
Isn't she your daughter?

96
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:03,614
My relation ended the day l
got her married in your family!

97
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,279
She is the honor of your family now.

98
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:12,619
It's your choice whether you
accept her or reject her!

99
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,558
You cannot change my decision
with your tears.

100
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:23,567
I cannot get her home!
My heart is crying out too!

101
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:29,298
- But, I am helpless!
- I am her mother!

102
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:33,902
But, I meet people outside,
how will I be able to face them?

103
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,646
Father is right, mother...

104
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,774
to keep our honor intact, we've been
telling people since 5 years...

105
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:39,909
that, Shanti is dead.

106
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:43,654
- But, she is alive! - The one
who is alive is not my sister!

107
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,253
Can't I see her just once?

108
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,265
You can see her!

109
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,662
But, you have to give me a promise.

110
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,291
I beg of you, please
don't let me stay here!

111
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,966
No, I will not go back.

112
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,709
He must be not knowing or
he would surely come here!

113
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:43,310
He will surely come,
so will my father!

114
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,977
My mother will come,
my brother will come.

115
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,314
He will never say that
I am not related to him.

116
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,535
Child, there is a girl called
Shanti here, where is she?

117
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,007
- She is inside.
- Oh! She is inside.

118
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,678
Come, Kamla.

119
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,699
- Father!
- My child.

120
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,371
I was sure you would come!

121
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:47,774
You are making a mistake child,
I am not your father!

122
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:55,784
- Father?? - Child, I think
you are under a big shock!

123
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,381
Or, the girl whom I have
never seen in my life...

124
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,719
why would she call me father?

125
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:07,464
- You mean...?
- Yes, I am not your father.

126
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:23,472
You tell me, don't you
also recognize me?

127
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:28,410
You endured grief
and raised me up...

128
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,413
you kept me in your womb
for nine months...

129
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,422
aren't you my mother?

130
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,830
- Mother...what happened?
- Come on father, let's go.

131
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,492
- Brother...!! - Don't call me
brother, I don't know you!

132
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:49,096
You too??...Even you don't know me?

133
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:55,505
See the scars on your face? I had
scratched you when we were small.

134
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,445
How could you forget all that?
I am your...

135
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,110
Why have you come here to disgrace
our honor after so many years?

136
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:06,448
My sister is dead! To save her
and our honor, she killed herself!.

137
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,477
Mother, let's go home.

138
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,886
Come on!

139
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,160
Mother!!

140
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,222
Don't do that, Shanti!

141
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,293
I should be apologizing to you.

142
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,099
I can forgive you for
any offense at this moment!

143
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,971
For me it is enough
that you recognized me!

144
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:04,969
How would I not
recognize my own life?

145
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:12,976
- I have cursed myself a lot...
- Don't say any further!

146
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,590
Let me look at your face
to my heart's content!

147
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:23,995
I lost everything in life,
my life had come to a standstill!

148
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:28,658
My life changed but,
you have not changed at all!

149
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:33,330
Let's go, I hope your father
will not mind my presence?

150
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:37,803
Forget about him,
we will not stay with him.

151
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:43,346
Why?...Will you leave
your parents for my sake?

152
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,948
I will not leave them,
I have already left them!

153
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,282
You and I will stay together
and make our own world.

154
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:56,022
- Come along. - I will...
you wait here for a minute.

155
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,629
I want to show you something.

156
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,691
Please wait here for my sake!

157
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,636
Look here, Keval.

158
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:20,650
This is your son!

159
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:24,054
I have kept him close to my heart
for the past five years.

160
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:35,665
My son!!

161
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,405
Son, what is your name?

162
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:55,085
Don't get me wrong, his name
is Anwar but, he is your son!

163
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:58,748
Let me explain to you
why his name is Anwar!

164
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,689
I don't wish to hear anything!
Come here, Anwar!

165
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:09,095
Anwar, what is your father's name?

166
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:15,104
- Do you yet want to say something?
- Yes, I want to say a lot!

167
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,699
The child is saying
what he has heard.

168
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:18,775
Perhaps he is saying the truth!

169
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:23,705
Keval, you should have atleast
asked me who Abdul Rehman is?

170
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:29,247
- Who is he?
- Abdul Rehman is the man...

171
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,781
who will not know who I am even
if he comes in front of me.

172
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,387
He will not know me by my looks.

173
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:39,788
He can identify me only
by my feet or my voice.

174
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,726
- Just as Laxman recognized Sita.
- I don't believe that!

175
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:48,740
If God could has incarnated himself,
he is in form of Abdul Rehman!

176
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,405
It's because of him that
I could reach to you...

177
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,136
and get your son to you!

178
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,406
- Abdul Rehman is like my brother!
- Enough!!

179
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,147
I cannot hear further!

180
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,151
For five years I considered you
as a Goddess and worshiped you!

181
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,816
And today, you are narrating
the story of Ram and Laxman?

182
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,091
I was a fool to go against
my parents wishes and come here.

183
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,428
- I never knew you would cheat me!
- Go away from here!

184
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,758
Go away!!

185
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:39,447
You are crying, mother?...
Why are you crying?

186
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:44,191
I am feeling very sad, my son!

187
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:50,199
Mother, remember, when I used to
wake up from sleep, I used to cry...

188
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:52,133
father used to wake up
and come to me...

189
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:55,136
you also say the same
what father used to say...

190
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,132
say after me, alright?

191
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,896
Life and this world are
both very beautiful...

192
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,490
but today, I am spurning both
and going to end my life...

193
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,837
many a times, death seems
to be an easier option...

194
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,495
and life seems difficult...

195
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,175
and today, life seems to be
very difficult for me...

196
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,243
by the time someone
gets this letter...

197
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,246
till then...
- Mother!

198
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,572
Coming, son.

199
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:52,395
Mother, I am not feeling sleepy,
please sit with me.

200
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,265
- Go to sleep, son.
- No mother, tell me a story.

201
00:23:56,402 --> 00:24:00,065
- How can l? Everyone is asleep.
- So what? Say it softly.

202
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:08,205
- Which story do you want to hear?
- Let me think....

203
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:13,545
father's story!
- It's a modern times story.

204
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,218
A brother had become
a brother's enemy.

205
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:22,622
The value of water
was more than blood.

206
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,295
My in laws had left the house...

207
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:33,231
they said that they would
come back to fetch me.

208
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,907
They lied to me, I was all alone.

209
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:44,906
And on all sides there was...

210
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,970
Is anyone at home?

211
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:01,983
If someone was there, I'd kill
him myself, I'd use my rifle!

212
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,655
Oh! It's you, we are sorry!

213
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,002
Sister, cover your face.

214
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:32,020
I am a true Pathan, I will never
raise my eyes and look at your face!

215
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:36,085
I am not a very nice man...

216
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:41,689
but, I had a sister called Sakina,
who is now in lndia...

217
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:48,699
I help the helpless women here...

218
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:56,045
with the hope that God will help her
with the Hindus and Sikhs there!

219
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:03,637
-What are you thinking? -How could
a saint like me get into this?

220
00:27:04,507 --> 00:27:12,380
- You're not a saint. - People
pretend to be but, I was born one!

221
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:15,707
- How is that?
- How?

222
00:27:18,588 --> 00:27:20,317
When a person becomes a saint...

223
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:27,328
he forgets the class, caste,
creed discrimination...

224
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,995
I am a saint because,
I don't know who I am!

225
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:35,064
I don't even know whether
I am a Hindu or a Muslim...

226
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:37,339
or a Christian!

227
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,008
Now tell me, am I not a saint?

228
00:27:40,343 --> 00:27:42,675
- You are right!
- Press hard on my back.

229
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,348
That's fine chief but, if you
don't work, what will you eat?

230
00:27:48,484 --> 00:27:49,678
How will you live?

231
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:55,354
He has a point after all,
the saints also have to live.

232
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,891
Alright then, let's go!

233
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:05,427
Stop crying! You have
irritated me since morning!

234
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:18,573
Hey, what happened? Come here!

235
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:23,716
Stop crying!...Did she hit you?

236
00:28:24,587 --> 00:28:31,390
Don't cry because, if you cry, the
world will make you cry even more!

237
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:36,728
Who are you?

238
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,989
I??

239
00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:00,753
Chalia is my name...

240
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:09,492
Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and
Christian accept my salutations

241
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:49,662
O everyone, just give it
a thought...

242
00:29:50,006 --> 00:29:53,134
somewhere there is joy and
somewhere there is grief...

243
00:29:54,477 --> 00:30:00,814
Why do such things occur?

244
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:06,211
O great Almighty, somewhere there's
light and somewhere there's dark...

245
00:30:06,822 --> 00:30:10,815
Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and
Christian accept my salutations

246
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:15,156
Chalia is my name

247
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:50,256
These beautiful eyes
obstruct my path...

248
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:58,938
I am just a sweet-talker,
I never learnt the art of love

249
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:08,614
I agree to do
whatever work I get...

250
00:31:08,884 --> 00:31:12,945
Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian,
accept my salutations

251
00:31:18,561 --> 00:31:19,550
Chalia is my name

252
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:44,252
I am the prince of the poor...

253
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:47,987
I can offer whatever I have

254
00:31:48,858 --> 00:31:56,663
The princes play with swords,
I wipe other's tears

255
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:06,607
My deed is hard work,
the rest is left to Him

256
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:11,006
Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian,
accept my salutations

257
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:16,015
My name is Chalia

258
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:36,695
- You want something?
- No, read this letter for me.

259
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:42,041
' Life and this world
are both very beautiful...

260
00:32:43,312 --> 00:32:47,305
but today, I am spurning both
of them and going to die

261
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:51,042
- What? - 'Many a times,
death seems a simple option...

262
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,712
and life seems to be difficult...

263
00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:57,054
and today, I think my life has
become very difficult to live...

264
00:32:58,661 --> 00:33:02,722
by the time someone receives this
letter, I would have been...

265
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,328
- Read further.
- Whose letter is this?

266
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:11,002
Won't you have something?

267
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,205
- Don't you have anyone of
your own in this world? - No!

268
00:33:18,347 --> 00:33:20,679
- Your parents, siblings
or your husband? - No!

269
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:22,680
I have nobody in this world
to live for!

270
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:32,418
You have nobody??...Come with me.

271
00:33:32,695 --> 00:33:36,096
Leave me!...Leave me alone!

272
00:33:44,974 --> 00:33:51,903
Why did I say I have
nobody?...My son!

273
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,715
I have a son!

274
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:05,720
Sister, your son was crying a lot
and left this place in the morning.

275
00:34:05,928 --> 00:34:08,920
- Where did he go? - I don't know
but, he has yet not come back.

276
00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:57,177
The door of my house
is yet open to you.

277
00:34:57,913 --> 00:35:00,177
I am not a very nice human being.

278
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:09,448
But I promise, I'll never misuse
your weakness and helplessness!

279
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:17,126
You assume that you have committed
suicide and you are born again.

280
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:22,536
And I promise not to ask you
anything about your past.

281
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:31,540
If you wish you can
come along with me.

282
00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:29,267
Wait...you wait here,
I'll be right back.

283
00:37:10,913 --> 00:37:11,902
You can come now.

284
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:31,660
It's a small hut but, I'll try my
best that you have no problems here.

285
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:51,350
How can we both live
in such a small place?

286
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:56,954
Don't worry, that place is for you
and I will sleep outside.

287
00:37:57,493 --> 00:38:00,018
- Out in the cold?
- I don't feel cold!

288
00:38:00,496 --> 00:38:02,020
I am a strong man, I exercise a lot.

289
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:10,037
But the only problem is that I enjoy
talking to the stars in the night.

290
00:38:16,245 --> 00:38:17,974
Lock the door from inside.

291
00:40:11,226 --> 00:40:13,490
For a minute I thought that l
have come to someone else's house.

292
00:40:15,097 --> 00:40:16,155
This house looks so different!

293
00:40:17,232 --> 00:40:19,427
A woman's presence in the house
makes a lot of difference!

294
00:40:19,568 --> 00:40:21,502
A small hut also looks like a home.

295
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:32,780
Don't mind my words,
what I meant was...

296
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:35,446
I do not know what a home means.

297
00:40:35,784 --> 00:40:39,515
I spent my life out on roads
and considered this also as one!

298
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:41,520
Have tea.

299
00:40:44,126 --> 00:40:46,117
Careful..it's hot.

300
00:40:57,806 --> 00:41:00,138
Mother!...Mother!!

301
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:19,559
Every artist desires that his
work should get famous after him...

302
00:41:19,695 --> 00:41:23,893
his name should be famous and
for that, one needs to have a son...

303
00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:26,233
and to have a son,
one needs to have a wife...

304
00:41:26,969 --> 00:41:31,235
so I have decided that I will
get married if I find a nice girl.

305
00:41:32,174 --> 00:41:35,905
It's not a bad idea but, you always
said that you'd remain a bachelor.

306
00:41:36,178 --> 00:41:39,579
Right but, along with being a
bachelor, I am a great artist too.

307
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:44,185
and I fear that if I don't marry
then my present will die with me!

308
00:41:45,254 --> 00:41:48,246
That's a great thought, chief!.

309
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:54,923
Listen...where are you going?

310
00:41:56,198 --> 00:41:57,187
Are you going to the bazaar?

311
00:41:59,201 --> 00:42:00,725
Wait...take this.

312
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:03,533
Get some vegetables.

313
00:42:13,749 --> 00:42:16,547
- Sister, I know where
your child is. - Really??

314
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:17,880
- Where is he?
- In Young Boy's school.

315
00:42:36,571 --> 00:42:37,560
Sit down, children.

316
00:43:33,295 --> 00:43:34,284
There he is!

317
00:43:44,306 --> 00:43:45,295
Come here!

318
00:43:49,978 --> 00:43:54,312
- What is your name?
- My name is...Anwar!

319
00:44:00,122 --> 00:44:01,111
Come here!

320
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:38,758
I remember the day when Rai Sahab
got you to school for the first time.

321
00:44:39,027 --> 00:44:41,757
You could not even
button your own shirt.

322
00:44:59,047 --> 00:45:04,383
Every great artist desires that his
work should get famous after him...

323
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:08,455
his name should be known and for
that, one needs to have a son.

324
00:45:14,463 --> 00:45:18,058
No!...I think my son is fine here.

325
00:45:41,424 --> 00:45:42,413
You didn't go out?

326
00:45:46,162 --> 00:45:51,429
I was waiting for you...for a moment
I thought you would not come back.

327
00:45:53,503 --> 00:45:56,438
- I am going now.
- When will you come back?

328
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,843
- Why?
- I will wait to eat with you.

329
00:46:33,876 --> 00:46:35,468
When will you come back?

330
00:46:39,215 --> 00:46:41,479
I will wait for you.

331
00:46:45,888 --> 00:46:47,150
She will wait for me!

332
00:46:58,501 --> 00:47:00,162
Wait for me??

333
00:47:05,908 --> 00:47:07,500
Wait for me!!

334
00:47:40,743 --> 00:47:42,540
You will wait for me?

335
00:48:21,784 --> 00:48:25,777
Dum dum diga diga,
it's a wet wet day...

336
00:48:29,992 --> 00:48:33,985
I slip without being drunk...

337
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:37,998
I swear by God, it's
for your lovely face

338
00:49:22,712 --> 00:49:25,977
I like your style...

339
00:49:33,189 --> 00:49:36,989
your subdued eyes and
those unsaid words...

340
00:49:40,796 --> 00:49:44,323
someone has fallen for you today

341
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:23,435
I agree that I am poor...

342
00:50:30,246 --> 00:50:34,046
I may not have a great luck
and may not be rich...

343
00:50:38,053 --> 00:50:41,113
but, my heart is rich with love

344
00:50:41,257 --> 00:50:49,460
I swear it by God, I've fallen
for your beautiful face

345
00:50:50,065 --> 00:50:53,466
Dum dum diga diga,
it's a wet, wet day...

346
00:50:54,136 --> 00:50:57,731
I slip without being drunk...

347
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:02,270
I swear it by God,
it's for you lovely face

348
00:51:03,779 --> 00:51:07,112
- Tell me what is in my fist?
- There must be something.

349
00:51:07,783 --> 00:51:09,774
No, you tell me what is in it?

350
00:51:10,986 --> 00:51:11,975
I don't know.

351
00:51:22,798 --> 00:51:23,787
A watch??

352
00:51:29,004 --> 00:51:30,801
It's very pretty.

353
00:51:33,809 --> 00:51:35,868
But the one for whom I have got,
is even more prettier.

354
00:51:36,278 --> 00:51:40,214
When she wears this, she will look
like an embellished ornament.

355
00:51:40,616 --> 00:51:44,484
- Where did you get it from?
- From the market.

356
00:51:45,821 --> 00:51:46,810
Did you buy it?

357
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:50,825
- Really?
- Yes.

358
00:51:52,828 --> 00:51:57,822
Show me your hand, let me see
how it looks on your wrist.

359
00:51:57,967 --> 00:51:58,956
My wrist?

360
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:10,239
It looks very nice.

361
00:52:12,181 --> 00:52:14,240
Wonder how it will
look on her wrist?

362
00:52:14,917 --> 00:52:18,580
- On whose?
- For whom I got this.

363
00:52:18,988 --> 00:52:26,520
She is very beautiful, so pretty
that when you see her...

364
00:52:26,862 --> 00:52:27,920
that you will be embarrassed
by her beauty.

365
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,190
- Where is she?
- She is here but...

366
00:52:32,868 --> 00:52:34,529
I will introduce you
to her some day.

367
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:40,866
- Listen... - What's this?
- Until then, you wear this.

368
00:52:41,944 --> 00:52:44,879
You give it to her yourself
when you meet her.

369
00:53:10,306 --> 00:53:13,639
Seeing his father,
the son called out...

370
00:53:13,909 --> 00:53:14,898
'father!'
- Sit down.

371
00:53:18,981 --> 00:53:22,917
The child looks at his father...

372
00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:24,308
the father...

373
00:53:28,991 --> 00:53:31,585
Why did you stop Anwar,
read further.

374
00:53:32,995 --> 00:53:37,932
I am sorry sir, I am missing
my mother a lot!

375
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:58,349
Anwar, are you missing
your mother a lot?

376
00:53:59,021 --> 00:54:04,357
- Yes, master. - Anwar,
don't call me master.

377
00:54:04,493 --> 00:54:08,623
- Then what do I call you?
- Call me father.

378
00:54:09,031 --> 00:54:12,626
I too will call you Kuwar,
isn't that a nice name?

379
00:54:18,974 --> 00:54:20,373
No, I like my name Anwar.

380
00:54:20,509 --> 00:54:23,967
- Why? - My mother
also called me Anwar...

381
00:54:24,113 --> 00:54:25,102
so did my father.

382
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:34,380
Aunty, please read and tell me
what is written on this?

383
00:54:34,723 --> 00:54:38,181
- It's written ' naughty'.
- Naughty!

384
00:54:38,994 --> 00:54:42,987
- You are upto some mischief?
- No, please send her here everyday.

385
00:54:43,132 --> 00:54:44,121
I will teach her.

386
00:54:49,903 --> 00:54:53,896
Buy rakhis!!

387
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:17,860
Sister, since the time Shanti...

388
00:55:22,201 --> 00:55:25,193
I am sorry, I was just blabbering.

389
00:55:25,538 --> 00:55:28,530
- Hello.
- Come, doctor.

390
00:55:46,626 --> 00:55:48,560
Won't you give her
an injection today, doctor?

391
00:55:48,761 --> 00:55:51,628
No Ramesh, I will not even
visit her from tomorrow.

392
00:55:52,565 --> 00:55:54,556
How long can we keep
cheating ourselves?

393
00:55:54,701 --> 00:55:58,762
- What are you saying, doctor?
- Let me say one thing clearly.

394
00:55:58,972 --> 00:56:00,564
She is not suffering
from any sickness...

395
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,969
she is suffering from a deep shock.

396
00:56:03,843 --> 00:56:06,971
She cannot recognize
anyone she sees.

397
00:56:07,313 --> 00:56:10,646
But doctor, is there
a cure for her shock?

398
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,982
Her sickness is her cure!

399
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,583
Whatever has been snatched
from her, get it back to her!

400
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:20,918
- I will go now.
- Okay, doctor.

401
00:56:55,628 --> 00:56:58,028
- How is your mother?
- Go and see her yourself.

402
00:56:59,365 --> 00:57:03,631
- Where are you going, Ramesh?
- To get Shanti here.

403
00:57:03,703 --> 00:57:07,969
- Have you gone mad? - Today
I know why my mother is sick!

404
00:57:08,107 --> 00:57:11,042
We told mother not to
recognize Shanti!

405
00:57:12,645 --> 00:57:15,045
Since that day, she has lost
her power of recognizing anyone!

406
00:57:16,315 --> 00:57:22,720
I think this is right perhaps,
mother is also paying for her sin...

407
00:57:22,855 --> 00:57:25,653
or why would my mother suffer?
- Shut up!

408
00:57:26,259 --> 00:57:33,062
She's suffering for bearing a girl
like Shanti and a rude son like you!

409
00:57:33,733 --> 00:57:37,726
Listen to me Ramesh, she cannot
come here till I am alive!

410
00:57:48,748 --> 00:57:49,806
Mother!

411
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:14,706
- Ramesh, whose ' rakhi' is this?
- Where did you find it?

412
00:58:14,841 --> 00:58:15,830
It was inside, on the windowsill.

413
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:21,369
On the window? Only Shanti used to
tie such a ' rakhi' on my wrist.

414
00:58:21,714 --> 00:58:26,378
She used to make it with her own
hands...but, how did it come here?

415
00:58:29,789 --> 00:58:34,123
Gardner...did you see
a girl coming here?

416
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:38,720
A girl was standing near the window
and she left crying.

417
00:58:43,936 --> 00:58:45,062
I think it was Shanti.

418
00:59:29,782 --> 00:59:35,516
I am standing in your path
with a hope in my heart...

419
00:59:35,788 --> 00:59:38,188
I am madly in love with you...

420
00:59:49,135 --> 00:59:53,799
O my beloved,
the light of my eyes...

421
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:58,809
you may stay away from me but,
I will get you some day

422
01:00:30,843 --> 01:00:34,904
Everyone can see
the clouds pouring...

423
01:00:47,927 --> 01:00:52,864
but, nobody can see
the tears in my eyes...

424
01:00:53,532 --> 01:00:57,263
only one heart can understand
the agony of another

425
01:01:46,252 --> 01:01:50,245
I fell in love with a impostor...

426
01:01:50,589 --> 01:01:52,318
my heart of glass crashed
against a rock...

427
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:56,918
neither is he mine nor does
he belong to anyone else

428
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:02,333
I am standing in your path
with a hope in my heart...

429
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:06,336
I am madly in love with you...

430
01:02:07,006 --> 01:02:11,340
O my beloved,
the light of my life...

431
01:02:12,011 --> 01:02:16,345
you may stay away from me but,
I will get you some day

432
01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:47,979
What are you doing?

433
01:02:48,314 --> 01:02:49,645
- I am studying.
- Is it?

434
01:02:50,983 --> 01:02:55,716
- I want to write my letters
one day. - Really?

435
01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:00,390
You know that I love one girl...

436
01:03:01,193 --> 01:03:04,060
I cannot tell her anything
when she comes in front of me...

437
01:03:04,196 --> 01:03:06,664
so I thought that I should
write about my feelings...

438
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:09,393
and I cannot make others write my
letter that is why I am studying!

439
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:13,995
- How much can you read so far?
- A little, I can read alphabets.

440
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:17,667
- I have problems in big words.
- Alright, read this.

441
01:03:34,026 --> 01:03:37,359
' It is wrong to steal'

442
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:40,430
Rubbish! I've got admitted
in a wrong school!

443
01:03:41,033 --> 01:03:44,025
If you keep throwing your books
then how will you study?

444
01:03:44,103 --> 01:03:46,094
And if you don't study,
how will you write the letter?

445
01:03:46,238 --> 01:03:47,432
I will ask someone to write it.

446
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:51,100
If someone else has to write it
then give it to me, I'll write it.

447
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,042
What shall I write?

448
01:04:03,389 --> 01:04:13,060
Write...my...my dear...Hey, No!!

449
01:04:13,732 --> 01:04:17,133
don't write dear,
write, only mine...

450
01:04:18,137 --> 01:04:20,731
That's it? No name?

451
01:04:23,075 --> 01:04:29,071
That's the problem! When I think
of her name, my heart beats faster!

452
01:04:30,149 --> 01:04:32,140
Okay, what do I write further?

453
01:04:33,152 --> 01:04:42,083
Write...you are so close to me
that I can touch you...

454
01:04:46,098 --> 01:04:50,501
but yet, you are so much away
that the stars seem closer to me...

455
01:04:51,704 --> 01:04:54,104
and I feel I cannot reach you.

456
01:04:56,108 --> 01:04:58,838
- And?
- That's all for today.

457
01:04:59,378 --> 01:05:04,179
Below you write, yours...

458
01:05:05,518 --> 01:05:07,110
only yours.

459
01:05:10,189 --> 01:05:12,521
- What address shall I write?
- Don't write any address.

460
01:05:12,725 --> 01:05:15,785
I will deliver it personally,
I don't trust the postman.

461
01:05:16,462 --> 01:05:17,451
Alright.

462
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:54,489
O my love...O my love,
you may do what you like...

463
01:05:54,633 --> 01:05:58,228
you may take my life...

464
01:06:05,177 --> 01:06:11,844
but, give your heart only to me

465
01:06:12,184 --> 01:06:18,851
Think of me sometimes,
take my name sometimes...

466
01:06:25,931 --> 01:06:32,734
do come in my dreams

467
01:06:46,885 --> 01:06:53,552
Talk to me for a while,
let me see your pretty face...

468
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:59,959
if you wish, I can get the stars
and the moon on earth for you

469
01:07:00,966 --> 01:07:06,905
But promise me that you
will never leave me and go

470
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:41,268
What do I do if your
memories torture me?

471
01:07:42,007 --> 01:07:47,673
What do I do if I don't get
any support from you?

472
01:07:48,347 --> 01:07:54,343
What do I do when the moonlight
also scorches me like heat?

473
01:08:22,381 --> 01:08:28,911
Come close to me and tell me
if I am bad, O pretty face

474
01:08:29,121 --> 01:08:34,991
If you are pretty as the moon,
I am no less

475
01:08:35,394 --> 01:08:41,856
Think of me sometimes,
take my name sometimes...

476
01:08:42,067 --> 01:08:48,529
do come in my dreams

477
01:08:48,674 --> 01:08:55,011
My love, you may do what you like,
you may take away my life...

478
01:08:55,347 --> 01:09:01,684
but, give your heart only to me

479
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:17,394
I can't find my spectacles, Keval,
read whose Ietter is this?

480
01:09:20,338 --> 01:09:23,865
'Aba (father), Marfat Khuda,
Pakistan'

481
01:09:24,675 --> 01:09:26,336
Read the contents.

482
01:09:37,422 --> 01:09:40,755
'My dear father,
greetings to you...

483
01:09:44,495 --> 01:09:47,020
you are there and I am here...

484
01:09:47,765 --> 01:09:49,027
but, where is mother?'

485
01:09:51,769 --> 01:09:54,704
'I don't Iike it here...

486
01:09:55,106 --> 01:09:58,098
consider this Ietter as a
telegram and come here quickly...

487
01:09:58,443 --> 01:10:00,775
your son, Anwar'

488
01:10:05,049 --> 01:10:06,710
Whose Ietter is this, Keval?

489
01:10:08,586 --> 01:10:10,053
Keval, whose Ietter is this?

490
01:10:13,391 --> 01:10:16,121
- It's Anwar's Ietter.
- Do you know him?

491
01:10:16,394 --> 01:10:19,386
Yes, he studies in my class.

492
01:10:20,932 --> 01:10:23,059
Send Anwar here from class one.

493
01:10:24,669 --> 01:10:27,069
I feel very sorry for this kid...

494
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:32,398
how could his mother
Ieave him and go away?

495
01:10:33,478 --> 01:10:37,471
How could his father abandon
such an innocent child?

496
01:10:37,615 --> 01:10:40,743
If we tell this boy that his
Ietter did not reach his father...

497
01:10:41,752 --> 01:10:43,811
then his heart will break.

498
01:10:44,422 --> 01:10:48,085
We have to tell him that his
father has sent him a Ietter.

499
01:10:48,226 --> 01:10:52,162
- May I come in?
- Come in, son.

500
01:10:55,433 --> 01:10:56,764
- Greetings, sir.
- Hello.

501
01:10:57,034 --> 01:10:59,764
Anwar, there is a Ietter
from your father.

502
01:10:59,904 --> 01:11:02,099
- Letter!
- Yes, he will come.

503
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,435
- Will he really come?
- Of course, he will.

504
01:11:04,575 --> 01:11:07,100
- My father will come...
- Anwar, come here!

505
01:11:10,515 --> 01:11:17,785
Listen Anwar, your father has...

506
01:11:17,922 --> 01:11:20,117
- Whom are you talking about?
- The infamous goon of Amritsar.

507
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:23,450
If he passes from here, the door
of the safe open by themselves!

508
01:11:23,594 --> 01:11:24,583
CIose the shop quickly!

509
01:11:24,795 --> 01:11:26,456
Lala, why are you clinging
to your safe?

510
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:30,463
Abdul Rehman!!

511
01:11:43,548 --> 01:11:44,879
There comes Chalia!

512
01:11:50,488 --> 01:11:54,481
- What will happen now? - Two super
powers will attack each other!

513
01:11:54,692 --> 01:11:57,160
Two swords will clash
against each other!

514
01:11:58,095 --> 01:12:02,498
One will bleed and the other
will quench his thirst!

515
01:12:07,505 --> 01:12:09,029
Khan, you have finally
reached Hindustan?

516
01:12:09,707 --> 01:12:13,507
I have and I am sure
even you can see that!

517
01:12:14,712 --> 01:12:18,512
I can see that, Khan!
But, I am not alone.

518
01:12:19,517 --> 01:12:23,044
I am alone and so is my AImighty!

519
01:12:24,522 --> 01:12:29,721
Then remember Khan,
I am also a true man!

520
01:12:30,061 --> 01:12:31,528
I will deal with you alone!

521
01:12:32,797 --> 01:12:36,927
If you are a true man Chalia then
don't forget, I am also a Pathan!

522
01:12:37,535 --> 01:12:40,197
I promise I will not Ieave
this place until...

523
01:12:40,605 --> 01:12:43,540
I don't settle my scores with you!

524
01:13:19,043 --> 01:13:20,567
Now that you have seen
this girl, Khan...

525
01:13:21,245 --> 01:13:25,648
you can avenge for Sakina
and abduct this girl.

526
01:13:26,651 --> 01:13:28,243
You will not find your Sakina here.

527
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:33,588
But atleast you can douse the fire
of revenge burning in your heart!

528
01:13:50,675 --> 01:13:52,939
Hey! Won't you eat?

529
01:13:53,077 --> 01:13:56,137
- I will eat Iater.
- Why?

530
01:13:56,814 --> 01:14:01,012
Just Iike that...I am fasting today.

531
01:14:01,218 --> 01:14:06,155
Fast??....I too will not eat.

532
01:14:06,624 --> 01:14:10,617
- I will also fast.
- You cannot keep this fast.

533
01:14:11,629 --> 01:14:14,621
Why, which is this fast that
you can keep and I cannot?

534
01:14:18,703 --> 01:14:20,295
You are being obstinate.

535
01:14:20,705 --> 01:14:23,640
Whatever but, I will eat
only when you eat!

536
01:14:31,649 --> 01:14:36,643
How can I explain him that
I am fasting for my husband.

537
01:14:38,723 --> 01:14:40,714
My husband has spurned me...

538
01:14:42,326 --> 01:14:45,056
but, I am praying
for his Iong Iife.

539
01:14:54,672 --> 01:14:57,072
What marvel is this, O Lord?

540
01:14:57,808 --> 01:15:03,212
I am a married woman but, I cannot
abide to a married woman's rituals.

541
01:15:04,281 --> 01:15:08,081
I am a mother but,
bereft of my child.

542
01:15:09,153 --> 01:15:12,088
There is darkness all around me...

543
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:18,089
there is so much darkness that I
cannot see Iight in your temple too!

544
01:15:38,716 --> 01:15:41,116
Listen friend, whether you
Iike it or not...

545
01:15:41,719 --> 01:15:43,380
I will address you as my friend.

546
01:15:44,722 --> 01:15:48,453
Listen, my friend,
I am in a great trouble.

547
01:15:49,393 --> 01:15:51,384
I have fallen in Iove
with one girl...

548
01:15:51,929 --> 01:15:54,397
but, my problem is that
she is not aware of it...

549
01:15:54,532 --> 01:15:56,056
and I cannot tell her.

550
01:15:56,801 --> 01:15:59,395
You know, I can fight
the toughest goons...

551
01:15:59,737 --> 01:16:04,401
I don't get scared but, this chit of
a girl, when I go close to her...

552
01:16:04,809 --> 01:16:06,140
I become speechless.

553
01:16:06,811 --> 01:16:09,336
I get tongue tied and my hands
and Iegs start shivering.

554
01:16:18,756 --> 01:16:25,423
- What are you doing here?
- Why, you think God belongs to you?

555
01:16:25,763 --> 01:16:28,493
- Can't I ask him for anything?
- Of course you can.

556
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:30,095
What did you come to ask for?

557
01:16:35,506 --> 01:16:38,441
- A Iittle courage.
- Courage?!

558
01:16:39,176 --> 01:16:41,770
Aren't you courageous enough?

559
01:16:43,514 --> 01:16:46,847
It's not Iike that,
the fact is that...

560
01:16:47,785 --> 01:16:51,778
I've not been able to express
myself to the girl I Iove.

561
01:16:52,923 --> 01:16:54,117
Then tell her.

562
01:16:56,861 --> 01:16:59,455
- Shall I?
- Yes.

563
01:17:01,866 --> 01:17:05,802
- Really? - Or introduce me
to her, I will tell her.

564
01:17:06,003 --> 01:17:11,464
- No, I will tell her myself.
- AIright then, you tell her.

565
01:17:17,081 --> 01:17:24,214
- Shanti,...I... - May God
keep you happy as a couple!

566
01:17:24,355 --> 01:17:26,482
No!!

567
01:17:29,827 --> 01:17:31,158
Listen to me...

568
01:17:43,574 --> 01:17:48,238
Did you see that, people Iike me
are born with such a fate!

569
01:17:49,914 --> 01:17:55,910
Before I could say something,
she refused and ran away!

570
01:17:59,924 --> 01:18:00,913
It's alright.

571
01:18:44,034 --> 01:18:51,497
Someone ask my broken heart...

572
01:18:51,976 --> 01:18:57,972
what I am going through?

573
01:19:12,262 --> 01:19:18,326
O fate, you have strange ways...

574
01:19:30,014 --> 01:19:36,146
you have deceived me
in many ways...

575
01:19:37,021 --> 01:19:43,358
when the flower bloomed,
the branch withered away

576
01:19:44,228 --> 01:19:47,959
The one I thought was Iove...

577
01:19:48,165 --> 01:19:51,498
was a mere illusion...

578
01:19:51,635 --> 01:19:58,040
it is nobody's fault

579
01:20:29,206 --> 01:20:35,338
I asked for Iove but,
I acquired separation...

580
01:20:47,091 --> 01:20:53,360
this world did not
give me anything...

581
01:20:54,031 --> 01:21:00,436
I was spurned at my first step

582
01:21:01,105 --> 01:21:08,443
I was detached,
I had no idea that...

583
01:21:08,579 --> 01:21:15,109
Iove is such a sweet poison

584
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:22,454
Someone ask my broken heart...

585
01:21:22,726 --> 01:21:29,063
what I am going through?

586
01:22:54,751 --> 01:22:57,219
- What are you doing?
- I am Ieaving!

587
01:22:58,155 --> 01:22:59,486
Where are you going?

588
01:22:59,623 --> 01:23:02,148
I don't know but,
I cannot Iive here now!

589
01:23:03,961 --> 01:23:05,826
- Why not?
- Don't ask me that!

590
01:23:06,163 --> 01:23:09,894
Why not? Have I done something
because of which you are Ieaving?

591
01:23:11,235 --> 01:23:14,830
No, you have done
a Iot of favors on me.

592
01:23:15,239 --> 01:23:16,501
PIease do me one more favor.

593
01:23:17,174 --> 01:23:18,835
Don't ask me why I am Ieaving.

594
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:26,240
But tell me where
will you go all alone?

595
01:23:27,184 --> 01:23:31,177
I am not alone, my unfortunate
destiny is with me!

596
01:23:32,256 --> 01:23:44,600
Listen...before you go, won't
you meet the girl I Iove?

597
01:23:55,012 --> 01:24:00,279
I will...where does she Iive?

598
01:24:05,289 --> 01:24:07,223
Come with me.

599
01:24:23,307 --> 01:24:26,902
Where is that girl? You are
taking me towards the temple?

600
01:24:28,312 --> 01:24:30,246
- She is here!
- Where?

601
01:24:31,248 --> 01:24:33,580
You will meet her now, come with me.

602
01:24:38,989 --> 01:24:42,652
Listen, you shut your eyes.

603
01:24:46,596 --> 01:24:47,585
Come ahead.

604
01:24:51,935 --> 01:24:52,924
Now open your eyes.

605
01:24:56,006 --> 01:24:58,668
- Look here!
- No!!

606
01:25:01,278 --> 01:25:04,270
- No!
- This is the truth, Shanti.

607
01:25:04,681 --> 01:25:08,879
- I Iove you a Iot!
- No!!

608
01:25:09,353 --> 01:25:12,811
Don't say that, it's a sin
for me to even hear such words!

609
01:25:13,290 --> 01:25:21,026
Sin?...You have forgotten that
one day, you were singing here...

610
01:25:21,431 --> 01:25:26,630
that you fell in Iove with a Chalia
and when I admit, you say it's a sin?

611
01:25:27,437 --> 01:25:30,964
Hatred is sin, Iove can
never be a sin, Shanti!

612
01:25:32,442 --> 01:25:34,637
Love is the most
beautiful truth of Iife!

613
01:25:36,646 --> 01:25:37,635
But, this too is a truth of my Iife!

614
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:49,655
- Who is he?
- My husband.

615
01:25:52,329 --> 01:25:53,318
Your husband?!

616
01:25:56,333 --> 01:26:00,064
- When did you get married?
- In my Iast birth.

617
01:26:05,409 --> 01:26:07,343
Why didn't you tell me before?

618
01:26:08,345 --> 01:26:14,409
You said yourself that you don't
wish to know anything about my past!

619
01:26:15,685 --> 01:26:17,346
That is why I didn't say.

620
01:26:19,356 --> 01:26:24,760
Besides, what else could I do,
you gave me a new Iife...

621
01:26:25,762 --> 01:26:28,754
and till date, I Iived
with the hope that...

622
01:26:30,367 --> 01:26:35,361
if not me, he should
atleast accept his son!

623
01:26:38,442 --> 01:26:42,776
- Your son?!
- Yes.

624
01:26:44,448 --> 01:26:50,387
Like his unfortunate mother, he too
Iongs for his father's Iove!

625
01:26:55,459 --> 01:26:58,724
- Where does he Iive?
- Here, in Delhi.

626
01:27:00,063 --> 01:27:03,396
He Iives close by but yet,
he is so much away!

627
01:27:09,739 --> 01:27:11,400
It's such a small world...

628
01:27:12,209 --> 01:27:15,144
but, the distance between
two people are so vast...

629
01:27:16,947 --> 01:27:21,475
they are so deadly and intense!

630
01:27:28,425 --> 01:27:29,414
Well done, Chalia!

631
01:28:22,879 --> 01:28:27,475
You keep it till then and when
you meet her, you give it to her.

632
01:28:33,557 --> 01:28:37,152
Are you Ieaving
without meeting Chalia?

633
01:28:37,594 --> 01:28:41,155
He saved you from dying,
gave you a new Iife...

634
01:28:41,565 --> 01:28:43,829
did everything to make you happy...

635
01:28:43,967 --> 01:28:47,835
but, never tried to take advantage
of your helpless situation.

636
01:28:48,572 --> 01:28:51,234
You may not Iove him...

637
01:28:51,575 --> 01:28:53,907
and he does not deserve your Iove...

638
01:28:54,511 --> 01:28:58,914
but before Ieaving, atleast thank
him for the favors he has done!

639
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:01,175
Doesn't he deserve even this?

640
01:29:32,949 --> 01:29:34,746
I will take Sakina's revenge
from any woman!

641
01:29:34,951 --> 01:29:37,545
You will take revenge from a woman?

642
01:33:02,959 --> 01:33:05,154
Khan, I am yet alive!

643
01:33:08,097 --> 01:33:09,758
Brother!

644
01:33:22,779 --> 01:33:26,840
- Sister! - Take this, Khan!
- No!!

645
01:33:26,983 --> 01:33:29,451
Don't kill my brother,
I plead to you!

646
01:33:30,186 --> 01:33:33,451
- Khan is your brother?!
- Yes!

647
01:33:33,857 --> 01:33:38,191
He is the one who endangered his
own Iife and gave me refuge.

648
01:33:38,328 --> 01:33:40,853
I can never forget the good
things he has done for me!

649
01:33:41,798 --> 01:33:46,462
Sister, pierce this knife
in my eyes...

650
01:33:46,936 --> 01:33:50,201
these eyes have cast
an evil eyes on you.

651
01:33:50,807 --> 01:33:55,801
And Chalia, you come ahead
and cut off my hands.

652
01:33:56,145 --> 01:33:58,807
These hands were going
to harm a helpless woman!

653
01:34:12,896 --> 01:34:14,158
You are going, Khan?

654
01:34:16,833 --> 01:34:19,233
Won't you avenge for Sakina?

655
01:34:20,236 --> 01:34:25,833
Khan is dead, Chalia!
Khan died the day...

656
01:34:26,376 --> 01:34:30,244
he thought of avenging for
one sister from another sister.

657
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:33,171
You have not found
anything about Sakina?

658
01:34:33,516 --> 01:34:37,509
No but now I am sure that...

659
01:34:38,187 --> 01:34:44,524
nobody else but a bad brother
Iike me must have abducted Sakina...

660
01:34:45,595 --> 01:34:51,864
I just pray to God that...

661
01:34:52,535 --> 01:34:55,265
he should pardon my sin!

662
01:34:56,539 --> 01:35:01,875
May God bless you!
Chalia, take care of my sister.

663
01:35:24,501 --> 01:35:26,298
Hey, blind man! Can't you see?

664
01:35:37,915 --> 01:35:40,975
Ice cream!!

665
01:35:58,068 --> 01:35:59,057
Father!

666
01:35:59,269 --> 01:36:02,670
It was because of me
that Sakina was abducted.

667
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:12,006
Father, forgive me, don't Ieave me
and go, I will stay with you.

668
01:36:12,149 --> 01:36:14,947
Don't Ieave me, father!!

669
01:36:17,621 --> 01:36:23,355
Father, I am sorry, I will
never stone anyone again!

670
01:36:25,295 --> 01:36:27,024
Anwar, come on,
it's time for our class.

671
01:36:27,965 --> 01:36:32,368
Father, I will never
stone anyone again!

672
01:36:32,503 --> 01:36:34,971
PIease sit here.

673
01:36:35,973 --> 01:36:41,639
Sit here...don't go anywhere,
I will be right back!

674
01:36:41,779 --> 01:36:47,376
For my sake, father...
don't go anywhere!

675
01:36:49,319 --> 01:36:51,981
It was because of me
that Sakina went away!

676
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:56,652
It was because of me...

677
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:01,725
Khan, you are here? I was
Iooking for you everywhere...

678
01:37:01,999 --> 01:37:03,990
Iook, your wallet
had fallen down...

679
01:37:04,334 --> 01:37:07,394
and there is a permit in this,
your permit to come to this country.

680
01:37:07,604 --> 01:37:11,802
Your permit expires today, you
will have to Ieave for Pakistan!

681
01:37:17,014 --> 01:37:23,419
- Where is Pakistan? - Pakistan
is the country not in Hindustan!

682
01:37:25,422 --> 01:37:30,689
- And where is Hindustan?
- Let it be where it is.

683
01:37:30,828 --> 01:37:33,353
You come with me, Iet me
board you in the train.

684
01:37:49,379 --> 01:37:51,370
- Where is my father?
- What are you talking about?

685
01:37:51,515 --> 01:37:54,040
- You mean that crazy Pathan?
- Yes, he is my father.

686
01:37:54,184 --> 01:37:56,049
- He Ieft.
- Where?

687
01:37:56,253 --> 01:37:57,015
To the railway station.

688
01:38:11,268 --> 01:38:13,463
I am also not a very
good human being...

689
01:38:16,073 --> 01:38:17,062
but, I promise you.

690
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:26,413
- Good bye, Chalia!
- Good bye.

691
01:38:35,492 --> 01:38:36,481
Father!!

692
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:47,433
Father!!

693
01:38:48,105 --> 01:38:50,437
- Father!
- Hey! Whose kid is he?

694
01:38:50,641 --> 01:38:54,771
Father!!

695
01:38:55,112 --> 01:38:57,103
Leave me, I want to go
with my father.

696
01:38:59,116 --> 01:39:02,108
Are you blind, kid? What if
you would fall under the train?

697
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:05,452
- Father!
- Where is your father?

698
01:39:05,789 --> 01:39:09,190
He went in the train, Ieave me,
I want to go to him!

699
01:39:09,326 --> 01:39:10,793
- Father!
- Don't you have a mother?

700
01:39:11,128 --> 01:39:13,790
I have but, she has Ieft me.

701
01:39:14,264 --> 01:39:16,459
Leave me, I want to go to my father!

702
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:20,463
Listen, where do you Iive?

703
01:39:20,671 --> 01:39:22,536
I study in Young Boy's school.

704
01:39:22,673 --> 01:39:25,801
Leave me, I want to go to my father!

705
01:39:47,564 --> 01:39:49,156
Are you going to Pakistan?

706
01:39:54,171 --> 01:39:58,232
Do me a favor, someone's daughter
is with me since many years...

707
01:39:59,176 --> 01:40:01,167
I have treated her Iike
my own daughter...

708
01:40:01,311 --> 01:40:05,179
I am growing old, if I don't hand
her over to her family now...

709
01:40:05,315 --> 01:40:07,579
then how will I face God?

710
01:40:07,918 --> 01:40:08,907
You can help me!

711
01:40:11,722 --> 01:40:15,385
Yes, this girl's brother
is in Pakistan...

712
01:40:15,525 --> 01:40:17,584
just unite her with her brother...

713
01:40:17,861 --> 01:40:19,522
you will earn good deeds.

714
01:40:20,197 --> 01:40:21,528
Come here, child.

715
01:40:30,941 --> 01:40:31,930
Brother Khan!

716
01:40:37,881 --> 01:40:38,870
Don't you recognize me?

717
01:40:43,887 --> 01:40:44,876
I am Sakina.

718
01:40:48,492 --> 01:40:51,893
I have Iost my Sakina.

719
01:40:52,963 --> 01:40:55,625
It's because of me that
Sakina has gone away!

720
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:58,564
Sakina is in front of you, brother!

721
01:41:22,259 --> 01:41:25,660
- Does this child study here?
- Yes.

722
01:41:26,396 --> 01:41:29,263
- Where did you find him?
- At the station.

723
01:41:29,466 --> 01:41:31,263
He was trying to board
a running train.

724
01:41:31,601 --> 01:41:33,660
Doesn't he have parents
who can take care of him?

725
01:41:33,937 --> 01:41:35,598
What if he would
fall under the train?

726
01:41:36,273 --> 01:41:38,605
Son, you please go out.

727
01:41:39,276 --> 01:41:43,269
Thank you very much for saving
the Iife of this child.

728
01:41:43,413 --> 01:41:47,349
- Who is this boy?
- He is a very ill fated boy.

729
01:41:48,018 --> 01:41:52,614
His mother has Ieft him and his
father is not willing to accept him.

730
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:57,622
Do you know who is his father?

731
01:41:58,295 --> 01:42:01,025
Yes, he teaches in my school.

732
01:42:01,498 --> 01:42:06,697
He has never admitted it himself
but, I can read his eyes.

733
01:42:07,371 --> 01:42:10,363
I know that Keval
is Anwar's father.

734
01:42:10,507 --> 01:42:15,501
- And his mother? - The poor Iady
came here after five years.

735
01:42:16,313 --> 01:42:19,305
But, her parents refused
to recognize her.

736
01:42:20,450 --> 01:42:22,384
Her husband spurned her...

737
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:28,324
the society vents out their
frustration on such innocent women...

738
01:42:28,458 --> 01:42:30,050
or on such small children.

739
01:42:31,461 --> 01:42:35,397
I have tried several times
to make Keval understand.

740
01:42:35,532 --> 01:42:40,936
You have tried several times
now once, Iet me try!

741
01:42:42,339 --> 01:42:43,738
And I will use my method!

742
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:56,747
Who are you?..Where
are you going inside?

743
01:42:57,354 --> 01:42:58,685
I want to know who are you?

744
01:43:00,424 --> 01:43:04,758
I have many names,
call me whatever you Iike.

745
01:43:06,363 --> 01:43:07,887
And if you wish, you can
call me Chalia too!

746
01:43:08,098 --> 01:43:10,828
Why have you come here and
why did you get him along?

747
01:43:14,037 --> 01:43:17,029
I have come to meet you,
to hug you...

748
01:43:17,174 --> 01:43:20,371
to kiss your hand
that is why, I got him along.

749
01:43:20,577 --> 01:43:23,102
He must have also never
seen a brave man Iike you.

750
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:24,846
I don't understand what
you are trying to say.

751
01:43:25,715 --> 01:43:30,379
I mean it, I have seen
many brave men...

752
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:32,385
I've seen courageous men
and macho too...

753
01:43:32,522 --> 01:43:34,786
but, I have never seen
a brave man Iike you!

754
01:43:37,394 --> 01:43:40,124
When there was a fight between
Hindustan and Pakistan...

755
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:42,455
millions of people were
displaced from their homes...

756
01:43:42,599 --> 01:43:44,794
thousands of children
were orphaned...

757
01:43:45,135 --> 01:43:46,727
thousands of women
Iost their husbands...

758
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:48,995
both the religions were at a Ioss.

759
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:53,405
You are a brave man who is avenging
that incident from a small child!

760
01:43:54,211 --> 01:43:57,806
You want to avenge the enmity of
two religions from this child?

761
01:43:58,081 --> 01:44:02,484
And that too from a kid
who is your own son?

762
01:44:02,619 --> 01:44:04,416
What is the proof that he is my son?

763
01:44:04,554 --> 01:44:05,748
Proof?

764
01:44:18,969 --> 01:44:24,430
- What have you kept here?
- It's an idol of God.

765
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:26,771
Do you have proof that He is God?

766
01:44:26,977 --> 01:44:28,842
My heart believes that He is God!

767
01:44:29,646 --> 01:44:32,513
Okay, Iet me ask your heart,
whose photograph is that?

768
01:44:36,186 --> 01:44:37,448
He is my father.

769
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:42,788
What proof do you have
that he is your father...

770
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:44,449
and you are his son?

771
01:45:03,547 --> 01:45:04,878
You still want a proof?

772
01:45:06,483 --> 01:45:07,472
Come with me!

773
01:45:09,686 --> 01:45:14,680
Look into his eyes,keep a hand on
your heart and say he's not your son!

774
01:45:37,647 --> 01:45:41,242
He has the same features,
the same eyes...

775
01:45:42,185 --> 01:45:44,847
and one day, I had spurned him.

776
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:48,524
My son!!

777
01:45:49,659 --> 01:45:52,924
Come close to me, Iet me Iook
at you at my heart's content!

778
01:45:57,067 --> 01:45:59,194
- Okay, I will go now.
- Where?

779
01:45:59,603 --> 01:46:00,865
Where I stay.

780
01:46:11,948 --> 01:46:16,544
- Anwar, now you stay with me.
- But...

781
01:46:16,686 --> 01:46:21,214
Yes son, stay with me, I will
take you to the Dashera fair.

782
01:46:21,358 --> 01:46:23,553
There, we will buy
Iot of things for you...

783
01:46:23,693 --> 01:46:25,558
good shoes and a Iot more.

784
01:46:34,838 --> 01:46:36,635
A father has met
his estranged son...

785
01:46:37,574 --> 01:46:38,973
and the son has united
with his father...

786
01:46:39,709 --> 01:46:41,973
the husband should
find his Iost wife...

787
01:46:42,112 --> 01:46:45,639
and the wife should get back
her happiness and family...

788
01:46:46,583 --> 01:46:47,914
but, what will I get in return?

789
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:49,641
I??.

790
01:46:58,728 --> 01:47:00,593
I will attain peace.

791
01:47:00,730 --> 01:47:02,994
How will you feel
when Shanti goes away?

792
01:47:22,619 --> 01:47:26,817
Well done Chalia, is this why you
came to Delhi from Amritsar?

793
01:47:27,757 --> 01:47:31,022
And in Delhi I Iost
my heart to a married woman...

794
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:34,619
never mind.

795
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:40,636
Get ready quickly, we are
going to see the Dashera fair.

796
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:46,302
What will I do in the fair?

797
01:47:46,910 --> 01:47:49,310
Why don't you want to go?

798
01:47:50,714 --> 01:47:53,979
Don't you know it's
'Vijay Dashmi' today?

799
01:48:54,110 --> 01:48:56,908
- Which one do you Iike?
- I don't want.

800
01:48:57,781 --> 01:49:00,716
Why? What's the problem?

801
01:49:00,850 --> 01:49:08,916
Look, what's written there,
Shanti ornament shop.

802
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:13,388
Besides, bangles are worn
by all married women.

803
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:17,789
Show me your hand.

804
01:49:32,081 --> 01:49:33,070
Hey! How to put them on?

805
01:50:35,545 --> 01:50:48,481
Everyone here, Iisten to the
story of a hapless woman

806
01:50:51,561 --> 01:50:58,228
you must have heard
several stories but...

807
01:50:58,902 --> 01:51:05,239
Iisten to the tale I narrate

808
01:51:12,649 --> 01:51:17,177
Even today Sita
cries in my country...

809
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:22,053
I have seen Ram and Sita
of this age

810
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:53,882
Teacher... Father!!

811
01:51:54,691 --> 01:51:59,287
The one you have heard about,
I have seen her...

812
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:08,564
O brothers and sisters of my
country, I have a new grievance

813
01:52:14,243 --> 01:52:18,577
She is the helpless, mother and
a wife, whom everyone can see

814
01:52:18,915 --> 01:52:22,976
She pleads for her Iost Iove
from her angry husband

815
01:52:50,013 --> 01:52:51,947
- There was a kid here,
where is he? - He has gone.

816
01:52:55,018 --> 01:53:00,285
Everyone has seen His marvels but,
nobody knows what she endured...

817
01:53:04,627 --> 01:53:09,030
her Iove is here, beloved is here
but, he refuses to acknowledge her

818
01:53:14,303 --> 01:53:18,637
Go ahead O my friend, you are
the only man in her Iife

819
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:23,035
Tear open her heart, you will
find your name etched on it

820
01:53:28,051 --> 01:53:32,385
Even today Sita cries
in my country...

821
01:53:32,588 --> 01:53:37,321
I have seen Ram and Sita
of today's age

822
01:53:49,005 --> 01:53:53,408
Even today Sita cries
in my country...

823
01:53:54,077 --> 01:53:58,343
I have seen Ram and Sita
of today's age

824
01:54:12,829 --> 01:54:17,562
She is the sister of a brother
who is upset with her...

825
01:54:22,238 --> 01:54:26,766
she is the mother of a son
who is separated from her

826
01:54:31,781 --> 01:54:36,377
If the father abandons his
daughter, where will she go?

827
01:54:36,519 --> 01:54:40,717
Mother recognizes her daughter
but cannot admit it

828
01:54:45,061 --> 01:54:50,055
Even today Sita cries
in my country...

829
01:54:50,266 --> 01:54:55,067
I have seen Ram and Sita
of today's age

830
01:55:13,356 --> 01:55:18,089
Why you cannot trust her,
is her Iove not true?

831
01:55:20,496 --> 01:55:24,762
Answer me, are her tears fake?

832
01:55:27,770 --> 01:55:31,638
If her grief is fake then
this world is also phony

833
01:56:03,139 --> 01:56:04,128
Mother!!

834
01:56:07,143 --> 01:56:09,873
Mother, help me!!

835
01:56:10,813 --> 01:56:13,805
Mother, help me!!

836
01:56:15,218 --> 01:56:20,815
Mother!!

837
01:56:22,225 --> 01:56:23,487
Mother!

838
01:56:28,231 --> 01:56:31,166
Mother!!

839
01:56:42,511 --> 01:56:43,842
