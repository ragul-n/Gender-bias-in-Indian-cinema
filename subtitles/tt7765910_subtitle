Sir, I'm sleeping for three days

4
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,040
Just when he caresses

5
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,780
Who knocked on the door
It's like breaking the door

6
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,290
That's the only sound, sir

7
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Are you ghosted, sir?

8
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,830
They're more dangerous than people
where are you

9
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,140
Sudarshan sir ....

10
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,990
Mr Sudharsan is scared of haunting
I'll see what I can do

11
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,990
This building is haunted
About your fear of losing ...

12
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,210
Tell me one story?

13
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,110
Kommadp

14

Nallakuḍi

15
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,670
There are about 10,000 people in this village

Narahenkody came under the control of Basheeradi

19
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,450
Because of the clash between the two
Both villages were not ravaged

20
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,270
Communion 30 years ago
5 Rupees

21
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,420
The locale changed the darkest area

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,050
The Cyclades are in the Cyclades
There was a bit of argument over playing cards

23
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,120
It's not enough that Beryable did not lose 5 rupees
Give it back

24
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,850
If you play a good family
You need to win or you must pay the local identity

25
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,260
What are you saying?

26
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,910
Do you know what to do first?

27
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,790
That's why it costs Rs

28
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,980
It will be for the rider, Narappadevi

29
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,380
Padeur's men were killed by the men of Pasadur

30

Anna killed.

32
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,910
Stay in Nallukud and leave the other

33
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,500
Nalparageddy with it

34
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,150
Pasuregedi's father killed Laxma Reddy

35
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,880
Leave me like your father

36
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,120
Go and talk to my dad

37
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,290
It's like putting on new clothes
Everyday such things happen

38
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,990
Paseurdee earned a lot of coal

39
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,800
I went to politics

40
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,740
For 30 years, keep control

41
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,420
For the first time, compete against him

42
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,280
Submit from the opposition
It seems only Narappadeddi

43
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,000
Just like him
US political leaders

44
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,920
He came to the house talking

45
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,410
This time it's like Narpparadde's side

46
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:42,460
It's better to write them here, Commaddup
Let's make a New Day for the Kondakale

47
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,260
Will It Happen?

48
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,120
I went to London to study

49
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,550
25 years later, Nalaparadevi's son comes to the village

50
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,500

In the election period these two months
We need to be careful

137
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,840
Plus, Paseurvedi has the power

138
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,620
Paduredee's power is only for the party
People have our power to let you go

170
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,670
Hands off, man

171
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,910
Just tell yöu mother

172
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,650
He was gripping you with love

173
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,220

The little man is in the line, sir

178
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,570
Sorry, sir, what's happening to the ghosts

179
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,580
All of us are still in shock

180
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,300
Daddy is gone for one party
It's a big loss

181
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,050
You have to eliminate it

182
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,880
After the works are over here
I'll meet you

183
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,260
Hold on, sir

184
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,750
This is the dark time, little gentleman
Let's finish the assassin's son

185
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,280
This is the whole country that needs to be our control

186
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,820
Even after this, we do
Do we need to wait?

187
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,820
Let's do it ourselves

188
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,340
Hey ....

189
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:10,180
Are not the houses in the village?
Do not the people in the houses need it?

190
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,650
Is your father retaliated for retaliation?

191
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,710
Should he kill his nephew in Bangalore?

192
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,510
Going on

193
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,290
After dad's marriage

194
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,210
He was a very responsible person

195
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,390
My sweetheart ... is my Sugana

196
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:41,750
From the morning when he got up, it's OK

197
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,590
After you're born

198
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,070
Your mother felt like a world champion

199
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,260
He's left alone

200
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,750
Collecting the company

201
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,270
He left the village to win

202
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,290
He'll come home again

203
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,570
Your mother is waiting all day long

204
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
From then on

205
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,860
There was no comfort

206
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:16,310
Your thirty years ago
Grandpa says taking his sword

207
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,950
That's a need

208
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,860
You're going to tell your father that he's going to get that murder
 Because of that condition

209
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,620
Many things have been destroyed

210
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,870
You kill that knife

211
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,210
That's great

212
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,140
Will you have that knife for your children?

213
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,210
Feeling frustrating

214
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,160
From the time you took the sword

215
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,900
It's for your own hands, generations
That it was received

216
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,510
Our people are starting to think

217
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,260
It's gonna be fine now

218
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,410
The ones that happened

219
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,280
Now, stop this, son

220
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,980
Who are you?
- Little sister Nagagalli

221
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
The one who joined the cook

222
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,590
This afternoon came to come tomorrow morning

223
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,810
Because my daughter was so excited:
It's so far in a situation

224
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,230
I tried to kill you

225
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,300
The police are my husband
He was in charge

226
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,440
He'll come home

227
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,380
I talked to the lawyer
I'll get him a bail

228
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,530
You go home

229
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,690
No, please, little gentleman

230
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,640
Do not bail him

231
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,310
Ram, take the bam away

232
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:00,420
Our little ones heard out in the office

233
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,850
He is trying to kill Bassurabedi's son

234
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,630
Now my man will come out

235
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,970
He goes to Nallukudi with a sword

236
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,400
He's waiting to kill him there

237
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:16,210
If so, what happens to my son ...

238
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,470
Do not kid him, please do not bail him

239
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,660
If he's in jail

240
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,150
At least wire out of the wire
Show son

241
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,180
If he comes out anyway
The knife is taking this husband

242
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,060
He's the only one he is alive

243
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,710
We'll trouble you, little gentleman

244
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,760
Do not get him out, man

245
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,070
Do not get out

246
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,540
Everybody wins here
Just looking at it

247
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,050
After all is over

248
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,250
No one else is working

249
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,920
Kenneth was defeated by defeating Kenneth

250
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,360
But one day

251
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,270
Anyone win

252
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,960
But, Vera

253
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,490
War will stop without coming

254
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,050
That's awesome

255
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,410
That's awesome

256
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,020
My brother ... my brother
Hey, you gotta talk

257
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:44,070
Not over there, again
You can not see my face

258
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,810
enough

259
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:52,350
God is more important than a son
If there is a sacrifice, there is a fine

260
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,170
What makes the daughter think to keep the thrill?

261
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,260
Who's in the house
It's in the dungeon

262
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:05,180
Go god to the treasure

263
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,280
Vera

264
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:29,080
Your dad went away now
Are you going around like this?

265
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,920
I'm sorry if he's gone

266
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,510
Except the sorrows of killing him

267
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,480
There is no other thing, Mom

268
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:43,890
Why?

269
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,220
Sword swallowed 500 rupees

270
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,410
That's 500 rupees for the sword

271
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,700
Go

272
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,190
Vera

273
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,460
Do you have a camera in the morning?

274
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,600
Get married
The children are in their own hands

275
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,870
It was said to be good first

276
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,900
What record books did you finish?
I do not know what to do

277
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,280
It's training you're off to the side

278
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,940
Are you speaking to Mom?
- Shame is not it?

279
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,510
Mother my father told me Koviffi
How many are there?

280
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,790
Not mine, Mom's one coffee
I said exactly

281
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,210
Hey, he's getting ready for coffee

282
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,960
Can you?

283
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,150
We need six people in the audience

284
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,250
Can all of them cricket?

285
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,760
At least he'll see even the other
You were born a year later

286
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,800
You're more than one year older than me

287
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,110
What are you talking about?

288
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,430
What are you talking about?

289
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,930
Tell me exactly

290
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,440
Our situation is showing a threat

291
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,500
Radhika is an aunt in America
Let's go

292
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,850
What? Do you like Pastry?

293
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,840
They do not make anything here

294
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,840
Tell me who did your homicide?

295
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,660
Make a video on this

296
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,530
All my private office is my office
Not matching

297
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,850
Close the cover

298
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,390
My eldest daughter Aravinda
- Welcome

299
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:31,370
What is the case?
- Trying to murder, sir

300
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,970
Tell me how to do it

301
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,070
How did you ask?
And who did it?

302
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,990
Then he does not care

303
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,110
Sir, he's our brother sir, he orders
This is why he busted the bow

304
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,710
Then he does not care

305
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,210
Brother's name is in the police, sir
- Then you do not care

306
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,660
Sir I took care of all the transactions, sir

307
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,920
I did not say if you were the only one
You two get up and go out

308
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,900
He says who needs to be

309
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,970
Everyone says it

310
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,550
Do you think you should say something?

311
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Eat betel

312
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,550
To Betel Betty?
Betel

313
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,550
Dad, I'm going to college
- Where are you going to?

314
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,780
Kokar willow sir

315
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:24,280
My daughter is going to Jubly Hills
By the same token

316
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,240
Immediately Damsmi Lassabanda
Where is it?

317
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,380
Yes, Brother Villu is this side

318
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,010
Jubilee Hills on that side

319
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,230
We have your case

320
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,470
To make the wardrobe?

321
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:51,340
No matter

322
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,250
Ma'am, give me the AC?

323
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,450
Or b ...

324
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,690
Do you consume betel nut?

325
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,970
Betel betel ...

326
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,950
Not a habit

327
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,990
Eat breast milk ... Awakening

328
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,860
Areca
- Give it

329
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,590
Ladies' seat
- The seat is OK

330
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,100
AC is available

331
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,240
Give a drop

332
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Thanks

333
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,770
When you come to college with college
Who comes to give you a line

334
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,290
Papa's what my dad did

335
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,770
That's talking

336
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,220
Greetings sir
- Welcome

337
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,720
The family of Nerpa Reddy is now in trouble

338
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,730
His mother does not care much

339
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,580
His wife does not know anything

340
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,940
His son does not like politics

341
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,850
Her home is his sister
Warlakshmi, ma'am sir

342
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,790
Tell her this time

343
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,610
Sympathy is coming

344
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,490
Sir, Ragawaraddi sir

345
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,040
When a question arises about who is being presented

346
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,320
Do not take new political decisions

347
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,200
I will tell you what is the solution

348
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,740
If you do not interfere

349
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,800
The sword of Besoureddi neck
They're all going to hell Mr. Sudhardan Reddy

350
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,160
Select

351
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,900
Why did not you come in this three miles?

352
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,520
Vehicle number one and brother
What is your guarantee?

353
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,840
Sorry, this car

354
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I'm going to buy

355
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,220
No, please

356
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,090
There's a carpet in this car's fuel tank

357
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:23,070
The light bonnet is the last time
The seat is new too

358
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,280
It came from the company
Only logos

359
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,340
What is this?

360
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,570
If a salesman likes someone who likes it,
Who are you from the middle?

361
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,610
Who are you, gentleman?

362
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,420
Who are you?

363
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,490
Hello ... call.
- Hello

364
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,510
Whatever it did, sir
If you do not arrive 10 minutes late
My 20 million charge will be taken, sir

365
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,730
Sir sir, here's my car
Come and get tea

366
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,650
Okay
- Sir, for my sake, sir

367
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,310
Come on

368
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,890
Oh, sir, bring good tea

369
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,920
Fucking brother

370
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:02,210
I checked my copywriter at night
But I could not find it

371
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,390
How did you tell me then?

372
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,530
Our car broke up two weeks ago in a brawl

373
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,240
I can not think of a fight

374
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,390
All of us are fighting
It was inside

375
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,660
Oh, I thought

376
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,300
It does not look good when looking at it

377
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Stuck to the side

378
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,480
The petrol tank was damaged
It means a big deal

379
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,650
Sent the rocks
Sir, how big is this?

380
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,270
The bombs did so

381
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,260
Busters?

382
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,590
You did not hit anything

383
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,850
My father did not

384
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Sorry, sir

385
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:43,070
I want this speech to be done to the election commission
I voted for a year

386
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,070
What are you doing now?

387
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,400
Put the water out of milk

388
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,740
What do you want to do right now?

389
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,690
Ah ... I need to see

390
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,740
I do the same

391
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,570
Look

392
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,050
Listen to yourself so far
You forgot

393
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,410
Veer ...

394
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
Raghavan

395
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,110
Brother tea

396
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,410
Nilambarē

397
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,400
Most of them were born because that name was kept

398
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,420
My name changed, sir

399
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,750
Some times I've heard some cases
Do you know how amazing?

400
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,390
That's just one small thing

401
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,820
What are you saying?

402
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,650
Your case

403
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,420
went to

404
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,250
Tomorrow's verdict

405
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,810
At least in 3 years

406
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:50,470
3 years 3 years
What's the time?

407
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,540
Now, think a little

408
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,360
Two Christmas and 3rd Festival ceremonies

409
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,540
That's the two of them, sir

410
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,710
There are three people at the same time

411
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,990
It's not for those good people, sir

412
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,090
Why is Bun thinking so great?

413
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,540
Sorry, sir
- Now

414
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:13,100
He's in there behavior is good
First we can get out

415
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:19,610
Then he catches his periphery and breaks the kidneys
I can get a petition from him

416
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,320
Then he is

417
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,130
He does not need to depend on anyone

418
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,590
He has the capability to come out himself

419
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,030
Happy?
- Dad

420
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,990
I need to go to the Parc

421
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,500
where is?
Banjara Hills

422
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,680
Yes, Banjara Hills

423
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,960
We're on our way

424
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,210
Get out?

425
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,050
No, do not

426
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,470
He goes to his car

427
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,950
You're leaving

428
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
Madam

429
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,210
Hi

430
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,950
Hey, hold on
- Stay

431
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,700
Where did you go now?

432
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,720
There are six

433
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,450
Why Fight Fear?

434
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,500
Like them as to who they are
You can hit it

435
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,040
But let's not argue
If you can prevent ...

436
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,880
That's awesome

437
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,320
So what's wrong with backing up?

438
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,920
Biphers Archeonoux in one hand
How many kill you?

439
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,060
They are all the same hydrogens

440
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,030
Krishan

441
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,700
Hold your weapon in your hand
Have you seen a photo?

442
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,620
But he has enough people

443
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:05,660
Got it?
I like whom I like

444
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,740
Mǣm

445
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:26,830
Hi
(Subtitle Uploaded by Nepali Guy)

446
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,650
Sorry

447
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,950
Sorry, sorry

448
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,600
I will apologize for not taking my father

449
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,650
Please ... Well, betel

450
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,390
Let's finish it here from here

451
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:42,970
Please nut ...

452
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,060
What is betel nut ... your father

453
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:50,380
We were gimmick for three weeks
Use it as a cleaner

454
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:53,710
Life in jail
Your dad says it

455
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,970
If we left the case, we could see Kartun

456
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,010
These are not needed

457
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,540
Hello

458
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,180
Relax

459
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,950
I'll finish the job

460
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:06,980
Look at this

461
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,520
Listen, we do not have time to go to court in the morning

462
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,350
I have to go to Tint night too
I do not have time

463
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,320
No matter what, I do not mind

464
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,860
But if they do not understand

465
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,750
Get angry

466
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,820
If you try to take half the film

467
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,650
Kill in the seat

468
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,520
Let me explain

469
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,280
Unless you understand, you can look after them

470
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,990
Stay alone

471
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,120
One girl

472
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,660
Great night

473
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,700
They left the car garage and fled

474
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:21,740
At the same time

475
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:23,980
Finding that girl

476
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,750
Six of you guys came in

477
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,380
What are you doing, brother?

478
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,820
Six of you came
To fix this for six

479
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,460
Six keys

480
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,290
Six keys have been taken

481
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,230
When the story's over
Brother doubt if there were six keys

482
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:42,880
That's not such a big story

483
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,770
I'll tell you six big men

484
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:47,850
Why came?

485
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,510
They earned a donkey

486
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,100
What are you doing now for the earring?

487
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:05,120
This girl is there
This girl came to leave

488
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,860
Is that all?

489
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,050
It's so hard

490
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:11,900
Betel Betel

491
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:16,080
A betel nut

492
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:22,020
He does not have bad habits
So let's go and eat cheese on our own

493
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,790
There's a saying in English, right?

494
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:32,010
Even if you say something, you do not say anything

495
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,960
Thank you, huh?

496
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,560
I'm not saying

497
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,930
Actually, you need to tell me

498
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,980
I will not let you down

499
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,110
It could have been a fight

500
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:46,730
your name

501
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:50,620
Or the address?
Is it also necessary?

502
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,310
I'm just asking

503
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,350
I'm not just saying no

504
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,120
Wait a minute? I need some space

505
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,580
Little

506
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,070
Use all of this

507
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:10,730
In the morning, Hyderabad came by the evening
Going to Mumbai

508
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,230
I could have stayed for one week

509
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:17,310
First of all, we want to hide our guys
Bangalore later on Hyderabad is not good here

510
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:21,790
Stop

511
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,240
Sir, sir?
- Beala's drives are checking

512
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,530
So you see we get drunk all the time?

513
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:29,810
So, get up, sir

514
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,900
Have you said that your children need to wake up?
- Nylon

515
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:34,690
Why, please
Wake up

516
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:38,450
Sir, this is a competition
Check it out

517
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,390
See how he tastes
We do not know what will happen

518
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,430
It's law

519
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:47,160
This is a small thing to you, who are you?
- Who?

520
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,600
Vera Raga Reddy
- So

521
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,570
You give 50% to finish your job

522
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,510
They care about these people
Not worth Rs. 100

523
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:55,060
Read the sir
- Sir, I'll awaken

524
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,340
Nilambar

525
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:00,490
Now if I'm awake, will I be sorry if I'm not drunk?

526
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:02,060
Will you get a train if you miss the train?

527
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,970
Tomorrow there will be an eniment with Amitabhachchan
Will you lose somebody again?

528
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:07,070
Nilambar
Sir, do not stop me ... do not stop me

529
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,730
Tell me, have fun?

530
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:13,380
Or the ID card Passport
these

531
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,260
Send it to me. Send them away

532
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,680
I just can not say hello, sir
Do not know bottles in the bag

533
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,810
If you go home at night, take a bottle of water

534
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,270
Check it once
Somewhere good

535
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:31,080
Sir, he's like a big criminal, sir

536
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,440
This is because in the morning you angry overpowered me

537
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,760
I was arrested and arrested for arresting you

538
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,210
There is no argument for everything, Nilembe

539
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,880
That is why our adults found a name for the karma

540
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:51,210
How can they be so sir?
Do not give me a break if you put me in jail, you will have to bear

541
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,460
Who is your relative and your relative?

542
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,780
not

543
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:00,430
Friend?

544
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,010
In the morning I was arrested and arrested in the night

545
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,100
B ... what?

546
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,240
In his bag, there was a gun

547
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,460
That's why you're sad

548
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,520
That bag is mine

549
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,340
So why not tell this story to the police?

550
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:15,860
Because there was a gun there

551
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:19,240
So, anyway, she's got it
What can you give up?

552
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:23,320
I'm not used to relieving someone who believes

553
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:26,950
He needs to get out somehow

554
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:30,070
You're famous for criminal cases
I found out that I was a lawyer

555
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:32,620
So you've been handed over to the boys

556
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:38,860
I'm out loud, sir
And take it out

557
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:43,040
This is a little complicated case
Take care of the information carefully

558
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:44,070
Well, sir

559
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,690
What happened, daughter?

560
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,180
Father ...
Because it's so fast.

561
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:57,980
To bring a water?

562
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:00,930
Drink coffee ... Drink coffee

563
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,710
What's wrong, why is it hurry?

564
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,350
Dear
- I'll be right back, sir

565
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:11,530
Baby, it's coughing ... not coughing
What are they saying?

566
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,080
just wait
Hiccups

567
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:16,260
OK, sir

568
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,880
Baalu ​​..
- Yes, sir. Wait a minute

569
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:26,510
Yes

570
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:29,910
We can get about a million of that spoil
He definitely gives

571
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:33,280
Claiming to be his friend
No need to pay

572
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,510
That's one condition
- have?

573
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:39,990
At home, children
You have to take care of yourself as a Guardian

574
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,880
Hey, what's that name for?

575
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,760
I've been told to be a man at home

576
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,350
Macro
Do not get angry

577
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,400
If you talk with the speaker, this will happen

578
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:51,190
How?

579
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:00,250
Now whoever comes in charge of a case, what do you take?

580
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:02,970
Fee
- But our guy is helping everyone

581
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:06,370
The same guys you came in before
You know her daughter goes to college

582
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,480
His wife brought her to his wife
Go with your school boy

583
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,270
During the whole period, I used it

584
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:13,580
So many things, they've lost a registered case

585
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,020
They will just go to another lawyer

586
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,560
Applying bail

587
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:22,810
Go to court and get their family
Take photos in the pocket

588
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,870
Now that you do not have a way out
- Me

589
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:32,000
I was playing with big keys yesterday yesterday
I told you like a story from a baby

590
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,840
Just ask for anything
The opportunity is not coming again

591
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:36,250
So your girl's name is

592
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,300
Eccayida?
- I did not answer

593
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:40,360
What's the name of the girl name on the bank card number?

594
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,830
The girl's name is Aurudha

595
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:45,930
MS Andra College, MS
Collecting people

596
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:46,710
Cast

597
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:51,140
No, that one drags each one and takes one of them together
- Fucking

598
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:53,120
That's why it's happening ..

599
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:57,410
It's trying to figure it out
Tell me what

600
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,340
What is it?

601
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,890
I like
- Do you still have coffee?

602
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:23,210
Coffee
- Thank you

603
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,270
If you give a little support, we'll give you the same

604
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,580
You
- Sunanda

605
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,050
Sister

606
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:53,970
He caught the coffee cup, handing it off

607
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:55,710
Then the problem was solved

608
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:04,430
It's learning a little distance from boys

609
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,800
Definitely

610
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,870
Did Our Balak hear anything?
- No, please

611
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:17,520
Did you ever say something?

612
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:19,820
What did you like then?

613
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:24,910
What I like is that no one is a driver
It's not going to be a defender

614
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,660
Then tell me your name

615
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,500
So
Tell me if you do it

616
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:34,460
Aravinda nona liked it

617
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,260
Wait a minute? I need space

618
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,020
Space

619
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:03,580
The sandwiches there are good

620
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,770
Put it in sauce

621
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,990
It's scarce

622
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,340
Right?

623
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,390
This is not enough

624
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,180
Aravindā ...

625
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,190
Hey, you were talking to yourself

626
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:32,980
Hang on, do not wait anywhere you can see
Like a ghost

627
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,700
People like this like animals

628
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,990
He has been in love for a year and a half

629
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,850
Whenever it comes to talking
Want space

630
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,110
Tomorrow's time for me
You smack your name in the letter

631
00:54:58,070 --> 00:54:59,150
Why are you so angry?

632
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:03,450
Why?

633
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:07,720
I'm laughing, you're so angry

634
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,720
You're angry

635
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:13,030
I can see

636
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,340
Aravinda nona

637
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:18,220
I'm quiet about Shanty
You scream like yöu and sunyka

638
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,760
You're just happy

639
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,960
What happened? Why so angry

640
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:29,580
How can I get angry?

641
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:33,800
I'm not angry. You're upset. I'm fine

642
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,580
That's why?

643
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,050
I'm in a state of laughter, but I'm angry
How do you know?

644
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,700
Out of the question

645
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,720
That's not us

646
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,150
Sandwich, okay?

647
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:10,030
He asks what a seemingly insane person is saying

648
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,300
Okay

649
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,420
Keep this copy yours

650
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,570
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much

651
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:25,850
You're not safe for this
You got work there

652
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,790
The son of Bassurabedi's son Nallakudi is released

653
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:44,670
There is no mum

654
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:47,760
And take care of Balarendi
Gentleman needs to be

655
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:53,610
You killed two people in that village
You think your little husband is coming?

656
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:58,310
Ma'am, that's what we say in Hyderabad
I will meet Sudarshan Ruddy

657
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,580
So what can I tell you, little gentleman?

658
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:06,150
I was always on bail
I'm gonna hit you sir

659
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,360
When my father is gone

660
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,040
One to kill

661
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,390
The dolphin here

662
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,990
That pain did not kill people

663
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,570
No wonder the car did not stop

664
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,340
When I left my village, I did not stop

665
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:31,020
But the first time the girl was met

666
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:36,050
After a long time I laughed and then lost

667
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:39,740
Wonder what?

668
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:42,260
That girl is studying the subject
Both my clubs are the same

669
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,300
That's why I am

670
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,960
What he talked about was normal
I found a solution

671
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:56,180
Say to Ina a man

672
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:00,060
It's a different kind of thing that can be seen in the champagne

673
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,910
This is the time I needed to understand

674
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:08,220
The one who understands Arahindah

675
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:13,280
This is not yours
Not you

676
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,160
Court
Are you in court?

677
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,350
You see? You see?
What happened now

678
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:21,400
You got the money on your lucky number
Hey, Ba

679
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:24,510
What is that fight?
- It's none of that

680
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:31,070
That coat is inside the Inner's name Ahnalla
The one who is wearing a sherwa is the name of Suban and his brothers

681
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:32,670
They have a bungalow in Annapolis

682
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:34,520
It's a bit of a problem to share it

683
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:37,590
This is my cable, which is my
That's it

684
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:40,950
Are you fighting for Lidak?
Come and go and settle down for what?

685
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:44,040
Our husband is one of the reasons for that
It was such a big palace built

686
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:46,010
This is the very first civilian case he accepted

687
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:47,850
Now it will not be solved for years

688
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:49,680
Why did you come here?

689
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:55,280
Do not give it to anyone after the case is closed
I came to order the court to order that order

690
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,770
Where are you without a house?

691
01:02:57,790 --> 01:03:02,560
Oh, do not worry about that. It's a bungalow in the pavement
A good tent was prepared

692
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,020
A tent?

693
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:11,430
Pins They're nothing like that old car
All apart from the Kamal Scrub

694
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,290
Everything is done for the money

695
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:19,590
It's one of my husband's specials until he retires
That's right, they're going to empty the purse

696
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:22,470
Amanulla to leave the government

697
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:23,680
Go go
- OK OK

698
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:27,360
Chia .... They do not change

699
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:47,580
Aaron, do not look at you strange
Seems to be wrong

700
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:49,980
Normally, you see the normal way

701
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:53,060
I want to go out

702
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:56,110
Coming?
Or do you have anything else to pull?

703
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:04,530
He's been this guy from childhood
If anyone talks to me, he shouts

704
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,200
Raghavan

705
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,390
Go or eat me

706
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:11,850
Over?
- Go, go

707
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:13,810
Let's go right

708
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,160
We need to go left

709
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:17,460
No, there's a lot of traffic here

710
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:20,110
Let's go right

711
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:25,860
Hey, little mummy

712
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:30,670
Little mister

713
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:43,230
I have a little work to drive
I'll be right back

714
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:46,910
Do not work like this
I do not like things

715
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,920
Only this road will boil

716
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:50,810
All right

717
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:59,920
Sinhala subtitles are downloaded from www.zoom.lk.

718
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,730
Sir, what do you want?

719
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,080
They did not eat

720
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:32,380
I do not like

721
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,280
Bring something to you

722
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:38,630
In the village, you think you're afraid of escaping

723
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:40,450
Just give it a try

724
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,910
When a tiger saw a tiger and a dog, he lost the tiger

725
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,120
B

726
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:47,970
What's wrong with getting off?

727
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:49,550
His son Baladeddy

728
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:52,240
You're going to kill the ground
He's waiting, mister

729
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:54,930
Reddy

730
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:58,650
When we say anything, we're not the only ones

731
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,240
Hey, do not you see the dog
- Sorry, sir

732
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,820
Baladerry is not afraid of anger

733
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,710
Tell your family not to do so

734
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,930
I'm going to kill me

735
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:30,110
Love for any enemy
A person needs Rama Reddy ... that's why

736
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:32,360
That's why I did not look

737
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:35,140
How long have you been to fight the village without a enemy?

738
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:41,020
My grandmother is giggling
He asked what was good

739
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,700
There's nothing good

740
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:45,890
Do you want to do that?

741
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:48,720
It's about changing it

742
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:51,750
Children with your family want you to live

743
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:55,750
Home and mother came out of hand

744
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,700
You do not understand that again
What if it's gonna kill you, what's up, lady?

745
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:14,670
Osānā
Little mister

746
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:19,940
Sorry, brother

747
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:24,260
Everybody has an image

748
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:26,930
Do not harm that

749
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,280
to wake up

750
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:37,070
It's not that good to be here
All of you go back

751
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:47,310
How are you mom

752
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,610
Grandma's good enough

753
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:54,400
Have a heartache

754
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,820
Osānā
- Mister

755
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,660
Do not get beaten up with people who have the length of the road

756
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,960
Be careful

757
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:10,790
Withholding our power, creating confidence for some people, sir

758
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:16,050
No matter how powerful they are, at any moment
A little mistake is Mr. Sudharsan

759
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:19,170
Raga Reddit did something like that

760
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:24,450
Mom, tell me my school class is a good story

761
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,670
Where are I talking?
- Oh ...

762
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:30,670
Your father is in court every day
Judge good speeches

763
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:33,190
How much a call was made from the muffler, mister

764
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:38,040
Just when you hear that
How do I know how my secretary knows them?
Eve's talking ..

765
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,530
Holiday in the college
Your father's listening

766
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,780
It's near the forgotten class, Daddy

767
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:49,210
It's in the middle of it. Is not it someone who knows me like that?
Go and tell your sisters to listen to both of you

768
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:53,390
I need to go together
Asked if you would give me your clothes

769
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:59,360
My nephew forgot where he was left
Look at that real word, go ask him

770
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:03,510
Tell someone in the open to say goodbye

771
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:07,930
No one walks around in our home.

772
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:10,180
Raghavan

773
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:15,040
My brother, the school's magazine
Would you tell me a story?

774
01:09:15,730 --> 01:09:17,230
Tell me?
- Me?

775
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,360
Please ....

776
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,440
One beautiful family

777
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,930
Mother is my sister

778
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:30,140
This one fell in love with one boy

779
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:33,230
But that boy and girl
Kemetry did not work

780
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:38,110
Now that girl is with whom
Mental involvement

781
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,680
Can I talk without chemistry without phyzis?

782
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,260
Whatever story tells us
It must be our own

783
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,240
our own...

784
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:55,600
Tell me the podda story

785
01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:58,630
The name of this story is a bony sword

786
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:01,330
One at a time

787
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:06,200
There was a state in Kosala

788
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:09,210
That kingdom was king Naga Arjun

789
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:11,850
There was another kingdom in that

790
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,200
That state's name is a petty country

791
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:16,420
That kingdom

792
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,100
Basureḍḍi

793
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:23,740
A king named Bhavavasa

794
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:26,080
For both states

795
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:29,630
It's been a war for many years

796
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:33,910
King Nagarjuna studied at school
He came to bring his son

797
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,620
In the middle of the two states

798
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:41,420
There is a pavement

799
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:44,330
The soldiers were fighting for these two kingdoms

800
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,180
From that battle

801
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,560
Ragaw's father, Napgarge, was lost

802
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,420
But it's funny

803
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:59,980
He's got his fallen sword

804
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:03,180
The sword crossed the river

805
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:08,930
That's the basement of the street
The cockroaches

806
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:12,970
blood

807
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:17,230
Grave ... everywhere

808
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:20,800
These are the consequences of the war

809
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,740
And then it's not good to be these things
Raguru

810
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:27,820
Big people

811
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:30,090
That's it

812
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:32,720
He talked to his countryman

813
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:36,140
We were able to leave the state weapons and go away

814
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:37,410
No ... no ... no

815
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:41,930
Stop the war in the opposite country
You have to talk to the CEO?

816
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:47,750
We do not want to like those we like

817
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:50,820
Fight with us
Their will is not useful

818
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:54,400
So this man is his hero
I want to love people

819
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,040
It is necessary to push people in the opposition

820
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:05,210
Are you taking out an asshole?

821
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:07,260
The police in the check post
Mister is also looking for a job

822
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:11,600
Do I get so easily?
I know how to take care of her

823
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:16,870
Hey, stop it stop

824
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,970
Where are you?
I could not get it today

825
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,400
What do you have?

826
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,200
Can I give you a jailbreak?

827
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:35,460
Going

828
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,520
Bālareḍḍi

829
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:30,330
Mr. Mahatay

830
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:34,020
Bālareḍḍi

831
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,060
What happened, mister?

832
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:39,190
What happened, Dad?

833
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:41,810
From that time on, I was with myself

834
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,420
Cinnappā

835
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:49,210
From childhood I cut off Subwo's hand

836
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,630
The confidant was Jalkeya

837
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,950
Can they save the lost ones alive?

838
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:01,420
These are for what, Dad?

839
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:05,660
The lad is Reddy's boyfriend
It's where he wants to die

840
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,470
Who said dad?

841
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:10,940
He wants this

842
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:16,050
Mm, I know everything

843
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:20,430
He knows that Narappa Reddy's son is there

844
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:27,700
He'll get the man out if he comes out Baleraddy

845
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:30,230
Why are not we?

846
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:33,670
There were 100 people in that day

847
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,700
Did you have something?

848
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:41,800
He did not spare any cuts
There was no bloodstained man

849
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:45,920
If you want to eliminate it ...

850
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:49,400
He did not even know the shadow he had

851
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:50,970
That's why

852
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,740
That's why he has not seen him

853
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:57,660
Make it up, check it

854
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,690
They want to finish

855
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,770
Anthropology thought it was easy

856
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:22,760
No, this is the father of Biologiy

857
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,590
Son of Cycology

858
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:27,320
What to do with your son?
His father needs to catch up

859
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:31,940
I'll laugh at evening

860
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,520
Ragawa, my special degree

861
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:42,480
Do not get it, right?

862
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:44,020
Listen

863
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,260
I do not look at you crazy

864
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,700
Have you heard about Frasinase?

865
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,140
Can be ruined

866
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:54,880
It has to go to a village with similar cases

867
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:57,360
People need to question him there

868
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:59,880
We need to build a record program

869
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:03,850
All this one is to be delivered in a month

870
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:06,170
I have a solution

871
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:08,730
Pomadōru

872
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,240
Pomadōru

873
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:12,500
Do not get it, right?

874
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:15,290
I do not look at you crazy

875
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:16,420
it...

876
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,170
Pomadōru

877
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,110
Italian tomatoes

878
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:23,650
It's a time management technology

879
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,010
25 minutes

880
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:30,430
Think good

881
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:33,230
This is 25 minutes

882
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:37,790
Do not look in here without the complete warning

883
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,250
What do you learn to learn

884
01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:44,800
Where to do this documentary
You need to plan

885
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:49,760
Designed and done not just to write it

886
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:05,500
We worked hard

887
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:08,400
What did you learn?

888
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:10,630
Not Anthropology

889
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:18,060
Your father is very strong
Seeing someone to see you

890
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:23,200
You know what my father is shy about
- Really

891
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:26,750
Every time she gets angry, she cooks with her mother

892
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,010
Next day out

893
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,070
When your hands were like that, someone asked

894
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:35,440
Yesterday we cut down the cultivation with the villagers

895
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,440
That is why the following is a hand:

896
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,490
They lie that way

897
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:43,650
What are you, Reddy, in the village?

898
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,280
Not in this village

899
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:50,840
It's a thief ... lost

900
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:57,370
When the college finishes, I'll meet again tomorrow

901
01:17:58,530 --> 01:17:59,530
Swearing

902
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:02,210
But like this

903
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:17,480
Why did you stop here?

904
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,850
Sir College is here for school
Future kids may be born

905
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:24,640
It has to be first love before that
Nilemberam has to flower it

906
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,910
Why are you going over here?

907
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:56,920
Where is 6th C?
- Former block

908
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,830
Why was it here? gets up

909
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:07,360
Today you were swept

910
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:42,850
Target failed

911
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:44,920
Serves

912
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:09,850
Come back if you come

913
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:12,380
It's left

914
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:15,080
If you escape

915
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:17,600
Finishing

916
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,890
Come

917
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:29,760
Come

918
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:45,930
Sir, sir, he will die, sir

919
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:56,040
Sir, he can not breathe, sir.

920
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:18,410
Do not hold that vengeance

921
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:21,460
You can live on that

922
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:26,510
He has seen destruction to this day

923
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:32,070
The sword that raised the sword did not even save children

924
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:37,220
Press

925
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:39,770
Son of Berylidadi

926
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:40,970
not

927
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,930
Basireḍḍi

928
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:41,180
Five minutes

929
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:45,820
Tell me why there is no reason to admit it

930
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:50,700
There was a lot of traffic

931
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:53,540
Like a friend in danger
Do not lie to me

932
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,100
You do not understand the truth, Auri

933
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:01,170
You know something

934
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:06,630
Before telling someone you need
Girls think a lot

935
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:11,070
He was not this one
 Ten people have been rejected

936
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:13,200
One is staying

937
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:19,160
Reminded him and closed his eyes
The whole world is forgetting

938
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:22,050
But you are not

939
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,140
The first girl to see her

940
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:28,110
He says that if he does not love, he will die

941
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:31,380
The name of the hand will be dropped

942
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:35,340
He bothered 24 hours until he likes

943
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:40,690
She likes not counting the girl

944
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,520
On the other side of the world

945
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,670
Yesterday I found my eyes right

946
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:51,110
Turned away today

947
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:57,070
Miss Cole and 20 minutes 40 minutes late

948
01:25:57,490 --> 01:26:00,930
That's not late. And you've forgotten me for 40 minutes

949
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:04,920
A more important matter left me for you

950
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:10,660
You're not the first person in the world
I do not like it

951
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:12,040
Auré, what I'm saying

952
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:18,490
There is only one thing that one likes

953
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:20,980
Like yesterday

954
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:23,360
That's it

955
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:25,550
Like today

956
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:18,450
Take it

957
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:22,280
Bālareḍḍi

958
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:26,420
Have you seen that Raga Reddy?

959
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:28,610
Men sent Dad

960
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:30,920
What sent me?

961
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,850
Our car was sent by Dad

962
01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:35,450
What's the number?

963
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:38,470
In 2222

964
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:40,290
In both cases, it's Dad

965
01:27:41,190 --> 01:27:43,330
Two of them are four

966
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,180
Which people have been sent

967
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:47,770
That was said then

968
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:51,520
Meera Basha vali

969
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,400
This is why I'm buzzing

970
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:57,240
Call that Perandi

971
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:59,220
All right, Dad

972
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:10,170
Hello

973
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:13,220
Dad

974
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:19,420
Is your husband at home?

975
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:23,950
No, sir, Chyninia is your business
What happened to Mr. Mahendra Hyderabad?

976
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:26,470
There is nothing to worry about
She did not have anything, dear

977
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:31,360
Ugly, Reddy

978
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:34,410
Hussein Pear get a call

979
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:48,010
Switch off cell phone, Dad

980
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,380
Waiting for a cold ice inside the head
Do you know how to feel?

981
01:29:03,950 --> 01:29:06,680
Before a tiger tricks
How do you know?

982
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:10,580
When a storm rattles inside your ears
How do you know?

983
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:14,780
It's like the cut-line that's the way it is

984
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:19,580
Cell phone when asked to talk about it
Let me turn off that one

985
01:29:20,590 --> 01:29:23,200
Not my genes

986
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:25,470
Is not it my son?

987
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:37,010
This is where the office is out there
It's all over

988
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:41,940
I will go
- Dad

989
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:47,340
If he can not kill him, he can not
My sword shook the blood of his neck

990
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:50,420
Stop daddy's dad ... Daddy, stop

991
01:29:50,450 --> 01:29:51,450
Dad, stay

992
01:29:51,470 --> 01:29:54,600
Hey today I will die or it will die

993
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:57,390
Daddy, why are you leaving?
I will go

994
01:29:57,420 --> 01:30:01,470
Hey, give me a break
- I'm leaving .... I'm leaving

995
01:30:01,490 --> 01:30:02,970
I will go

996
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,140
Go

997
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,780
I'm looking for Widener

998
01:30:06,910 --> 01:30:10,380
Found
I will kill myself at the place where it is found

999
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:14,210
Kill

1000
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:28,270
No, sir

1001
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:31,080
Basuraendi is where you are
Knowing

1002
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:34,070
You will not be better in this village again

1003
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:37,010
I left but did not open the bed

1004
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:40,500
Coming to school today, I will come home tomorrow

1005
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:44,800
You think about those in this house
I'm worried about those people in that house

1006
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:54,220
If they need it, it's Lamborghini
Trying to escape

1007
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:56,040
Kill

1008
01:30:57,230 --> 01:30:58,750
But these are

1009
01:30:59,570 --> 01:31:01,430
Girls ... little kids

1010
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:08,270
If anything happens to him, then whoever will kill him
How many people will be killed without suffering

1011
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:11,780
And I'd like to stay in this house

1012
01:31:12,690 --> 01:31:13,690
Anyway

1013
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:16,240
need to

1014
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:22,560
Ragaa Greetings, you do not have to be here now
That betel punishment was punished

1015
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:27,060
Yes Sir, it shouted the lawyer very much and we talked
Two years now and I've been in five years

1016
01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:29,720
What time is it?

1017
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:33,660
I did not agree because you were scared

1018
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:36,250
Because I like it here

1019
01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:38,670
I will not leave at your address

1020
01:31:38,730 --> 01:31:40,850
I'm just hanging around when I think

1021
01:31:41,950 --> 01:31:43,310
Got it?

1022
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:45,100
It

1023
01:31:45,310 --> 01:31:46,310
It

1024
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:47,970
This is what this is saying

1025
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,260
So what happened to us?

1026
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:52,680
Mr.

1027
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,890
Come in early tomorrow, mister

1028
01:31:57,830 --> 01:31:59,970
Let's talk Rama's at home

1029
01:32:00,570 --> 01:32:01,390
Why?

1030
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:02,810
It's her birthday

1031
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:07,820
I was the one for her birthday
 I am trying to sow biryani I do not understand it

1032
01:32:08,210 --> 01:32:10,570
He likes me to make Miri Biriyani

1033
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:13,400
It's a great choice

1034
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:19,550
He tried to give Elves pork
He's on our head

1035
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,350
As soon as Dad's talking
The machine was removed

1036
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:26,020
We're all free to each other
That's what Raghava wants

1037
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,740
Do not cheat us

1038
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:30,370
Do not really dare

1039
01:32:30,490 --> 01:32:32,660
Should not be ... do not ...

1040
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:35,560
I'll go to college alone

1041
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:39,890
Who is going to let you go alone?
I'll take care of this

1042
01:32:43,790 --> 01:32:45,400
He's got a big deal, Dad

1043
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:48,550
It's not normal, it's dope
Generally high

1044
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:01,080
Where is your name?

1045
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:04,400
He was put away

1046
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:06,280
Her
- Yes

1047
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:07,590
Good daughter

1048
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:11,340
He's always dropping you to the college
He's dropping him in the garage

1049
01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:16,140
He helps this old man
I have to tell him here

1050
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:18,320
We have to respect the grown-ups

1051
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:20,680
Whenever you're listening to Dad

1052
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:32,100
Is Narpan Reddy's son come here?

1053
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:37,080
Call me
- Right, sir

1054
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:41,880
Sir
- Come on, sir

1055
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:52,960
Prateek

1056
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:54,850
Prateek

1057
01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:57,650
Tell me how can I help you?

1058
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:02,250
I need a meeting with Balerendi

1059
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:06,650
We need a solution to these conflicts

1060
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:09,490
Everyone needs peace

1061
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:13,110
Excuse me. Did you see a schoolboy?
She was from school uniforms

1062
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:15,090
peace

1063
01:34:17,290 --> 01:34:19,900
In some villages the tea is on edge
Brings it

1064
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:22,310
But he gives it a glass saucer here

1065
01:34:22,610 --> 01:34:24,200
We're drinking a cup of coffee here

1066
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,140
But it's easy to peel

1067
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:31,370
Even if your village needs peace as well
I do not agree to meet you either

1068
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:34,660
Raghavan

1069
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:43,590
For thirty years, your province
As a politician, I'm working

1070
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:47,010
Think about how to bring peace
To get tired

1071
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,340
They put my hand in my arms and bomb them

1072
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:51,320
Raga Reddy

1073
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:54,880
Preparation is in your DNA

1074
01:34:55,710 --> 01:34:56,710
Does not change

1075
01:34:59,350 --> 01:35:00,830
It's ok not talking

1076
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:02,480
Sorry, sir

1077
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:04,380
Hello

1078
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:07,720
Hello, this time, the phone
Why did not you take it?

1079
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:09,750
Tell me about the meeting

1080
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:13,090
Take Mallie's uniform for school
You do not see him at the mill

1081
01:35:13,210 --> 01:35:15,740
Sister, Sister ...

1082
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:19,770
Let's get this guy

1083
01:35:22,730 --> 01:35:24,630
Hey, it's noisy
- Let's go

1084
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:32,970
I was missing or killed
Quickly go

1085
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:33,850
Aravindā

1086
01:35:33,890 --> 01:35:35,680
We're going to the city quickly
We need to pass

1087
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:37,240
I understand what's going on

1088
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,110
Listen to me without you talking

1089
01:35:40,370 --> 01:35:43,280
Does not your guy have one arm?
Or say Hmm

1090
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:47,100
After that, Reddy

1091
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:48,710
Go

1092
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:53,370
Go to your habit of killing yourself

1093
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:56,390
We are politicians with the rest
We'll need it

1094
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:03,220
Please bring more tea, sir

1095
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,230
Aue, listen carefully to what I say

1096
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:18,540
I'm scared, too
Now he's scared

1097
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:21,360
I will put you on this car
They do not say that they will be saved

1098
01:36:21,430 --> 01:36:23,660
Because it's a lie
You're in danger now

1099
01:36:24,850 --> 01:36:25,920
That's true

1100
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:27,770
They can threaten you

1101
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:29,810
You can hit it

1102
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:32,380
Can even kill you.

1103
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:36,410
If that happens

1104
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:40,530
All right, I'm crying for you

1105
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:43,370
Only cry is alive

1106
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,520
Turn speaker

1107
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:53,200
He's talking to whom he's calling

1108
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,300
I do not know who your people are

1109
01:37:01,710 --> 01:37:04,260
But I find it is not a hard task

1110
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,870
You hijacked me

1111
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:10,490
You can do what he wants today

1112
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:13,210
But tomorrow

1113
01:37:14,330 --> 01:37:15,330
my

1114
01:37:17,410 --> 01:37:21,050
You're still a man from now on
Just listen to what's said

1115
01:37:22,410 --> 01:37:26,560
But you are now one male
Show me how to feel guilty

1116
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:32,850
From now on, in which village you are hiding

1117
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:36,300
With how many emails you are

1118
01:37:37,070 --> 01:37:39,860
If that girl is touched

1119
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:45,490
Mahendra Veera is waiting for Reddy's sword
It's a promise to let you down

1120
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:52,570
Remember

1121
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:55,390
Not one of you

1122
01:37:56,450 --> 01:38:00,950
I will grab my leg and torture me to kill me

1123
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:06,810
At this point, you showed only fear of death

1124
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:09,630
You're hunting

1125
01:38:10,790 --> 01:38:14,120
At least I am you
The hopeful death is brought

1126
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:22,310
When the death is spoken

1127
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:26,150
This sounds like this

1128
01:38:56,990 --> 01:38:58,100
Bali Reddy

1129
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,140
Do you know me

1130
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:04,260
If you kill your child, kill him

1131
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:08,840
Before you go to the village, I will come and kill you

1132
01:39:12,650 --> 01:39:14,390
Bangloor is near me here

1133
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:15,950
First go there

1134
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,760
Teach you there, kill your son

1135
01:39:20,950 --> 01:39:23,560
You're gonna lose everything to ask

1136
01:39:24,590 --> 01:39:27,450
You will not be allowed to cough well, Junior Reddy

1137
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:31,700
It's like a dark cloud covering the sky
Hold Nashuddy

1138
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:34,520
or

1139
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:37,320
If you think of this wars

1140
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:40,390
You're giving away the kid to his sister

1141
01:39:41,530 --> 01:39:43,850
Let me show you how to stay calm

1142
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:46,140
Tell me you like

1143
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:49,450
I'll show you pretty

1144
01:40:09,190 --> 01:40:11,510
I'll be there for you

1145
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,440
Not only our own people, but sir

1146
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:16,620
Our enemies are always listening

1147
01:40:17,290 --> 01:40:18,820
You saw yourself

1148
01:40:21,230 --> 01:40:22,880
Fighting is not my DNA, sir

1149
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:27,380
Something I got with a kid

1150
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:38,760
A guy who gets 100 feet in the well is getting water
What do you mean, dig up to 99 feet and stop?

1151
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:40,700
You believe and open your hand

1152
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:43,530
These are the same with 100, sir

1153
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:44,960
Think about it

1154
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:17,870
Dear
You did not have anything, did you?

1155
01:41:18,050 --> 01:41:19,050
I'm fine

1156
01:41:19,530 --> 01:41:20,390
I'm fine

1157
01:41:20,490 --> 01:41:21,360
Here
- Anxi

1158
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:22,830
I'm fine, Mom
- Aynda

1159
01:41:24,270 --> 01:41:25,870
How can i say goodbye
- What happened to him?

1160
01:41:25,890 --> 01:41:27,140
After so many things

1161
01:41:27,620 --> 01:41:30,680
Hey ..
- Hey, stop ... Stop ...

1162
01:41:30,930 --> 01:41:32,390
What kind of mistake he is attacking

1163
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:34,270
Because you can not hit

1164
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:37,110
Hey there ... stop ...

1165
01:41:37,740 --> 01:41:41,560
30000 rupees for his handsome business
That's why he got home

1166
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:43,560
It's my fault?
- Yes

1167
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:47,640
Talk to us about saving us

1168
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:49,730
It's time for you to escape
We're on our way

1169
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:53,630
Go ... go inside

1170
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:55,240
Raghavan

1171
01:41:56,230 --> 01:41:57,900
I asked you to come from you

1172
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:01,600
I do not have to go anywhere else
Please tell me to do it

1173
01:42:04,690 --> 01:42:06,590
I told you
- Going, sir

1174
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,730
But there's a treasure in there

1175
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:14,870
Now I'm going to see

1176
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:17,420
Then come pick up

1177
01:42:51,630 --> 01:42:53,480
We got you the first time

1178
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:57,820
I thought I had a solution to my problem

1179
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,500
But a few days ago

1180
01:43:03,950 --> 01:43:06,650
I realized that you are the solution

1181
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:10,660
No ... it's wrong

1182
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:13,090
You say it

1183
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:16,020
After a girl and a lad

1184
01:43:17,550 --> 01:43:20,590
A boy on the side of a girl
I'm seeing the world

1185
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,060
That's wrong too

1186
01:43:28,330 --> 01:43:31,570
Because win every male in the world
You can leave aside

1187
01:43:32,690 --> 01:43:33,690
as me

1188
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,440
On a trip you get a girl like yourself

1189
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:41,530
If that girl is gone now

1190
01:43:41,830 --> 01:43:43,660
Fear of seeing me again

1191
01:43:44,630 --> 01:43:45,980
He gives him the first place

1192
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:48,840
I think all the rest afterwards

1193
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:51,080
Then you

1194
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:55,140
Once again I won
It's supposed to win the world

1195
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,260
I can not do it

1196
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:04,860
You're coming to my war after the war

1197
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:07,710
That day

1198
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:11,870
Before you last me before one o'clock

1199
01:44:12,450 --> 01:44:14,020
I'm covering my eyes

1200
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:18,110
That guy will introduce you to that guy

1201
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:32,330
A woman's happy for a man
Make money to earn

1202
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:35,230
Comfort if you give the gold
I think if you give it

1203
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:38,870
Do not miss them ... if you give me some time

1204
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:44,220
With my father and my mother
The time has not passed

1205
01:44:46,650 --> 01:44:48,110
25 years

1206
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:51,690
The door is set

1207
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,520
I put my head on his lap

1208
01:44:57,250 --> 01:45:00,400
Saying a song is waiting all night without sleep

1209
01:45:02,470 --> 01:45:04,580
I thought it was a pleasure to say

1210
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:08,820
Now understand ....

1211
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:12,790
It's my father's pain

1212
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:26,510
Nagapapa Reddy made such a big mistake

1213
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:30,130
So much for your wife

1214
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:34,810
Did you hear the song that my mother once called or heard?

1215
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:37,920
Wherever he is, he's coming back

1216
01:49:46,810 --> 01:49:48,410
I'm Chrisha Redd

1217
01:49:48,770 --> 01:49:50,480
The biggest trouble

1218
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:52,650
Baladandry liked it

1219
01:49:53,390 --> 01:49:55,220
Sudarshana Reddith is coming to this discussion

1220
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:56,680
So

1221
01:49:57,450 --> 01:49:58,750
The meeting has been organized

1222
01:49:58,770 --> 01:49:59,700
Thank you, sir

1223
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:01,340
Mr. Rageau Reddy

1224
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,580
I am the only thing you said
It's like this

1225
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:08,270
Let's see if it will work for us advantageously

1226
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:10,150
Or else the other side will work

1227
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:12,540
best wishes

1228
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:19,160
What war is he to win?

1229
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:22,380
Where did he get a big win over that day?

1230
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:29,180
Oh ... without saying what his fight is
When I go to dispute with him ...

1231
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:30,810
Will you open your hand?

1232
01:50:31,430 --> 01:50:34,380
Because I was a little man, I came to the garage

1233
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:38,590
I'm from him because he is rational
He demanded the same

1234
01:50:42,180 --> 01:50:45,450
Is there anything you did already in the way?
 That girl must understand

1235
01:50:45,470 --> 01:50:47,520
Why are you suffering for them?

1236
01:50:55,060 --> 01:50:56,060
Why?

1237
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:01,300
Kiddie's going to the left to the left

1238
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:03,010
Let's go south today

1239
01:51:05,130 --> 01:51:06,900
Then I saw people in my village

1240
01:51:08,230 --> 01:51:12,660
If they did not see them, they would not
I was worried about what happened

1241
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:14,720
Envelops

1242
01:51:16,930 --> 01:51:19,870
Because his brother told him to talk
I learned that Breese survived

1243
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:21,680
That's why

1244
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:28,720
We have to speak for the sake of gratitude
Not with our people but with our enemies

1245
01:51:29,970 --> 01:51:32,760
I met the Opposition Leader and spoke

1246
01:51:33,410 --> 01:51:34,410
Too

1247
01:51:36,610 --> 01:51:41,360
We went to hide from the people of Besarbeddi
A house of his dad's client

1248
01:51:43,510 --> 01:51:45,020
Do you need more reasons?

1249
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:49,270
Many good things came from him

1250
01:51:50,510 --> 01:51:52,160
If something bad happens

1251
01:51:52,810 --> 01:51:54,120
That's because of us, Dolphin

1252
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:57,170
I kidnapped her myself

1253
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:03,870
When one girl gets out of trouble
It's a big thing, a guy

1254
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:08,110
But he saved himself again
If you get into trouble

1255
01:52:09,630 --> 01:52:11,370
Feeling embarrassed

1256
01:52:13,250 --> 01:52:15,270
If I'm here, to your life
Detection is Novembre

1257
01:52:20,590 --> 01:52:22,120
Why are the men?

1258
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:25,840
All the others without us
Talking with

1259
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:28,840
We do not even think we can do anything
I think

1260
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:32,140
Who has allowed such things

1261
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:33,500
Are you me?

1262
01:52:33,590 --> 01:52:34,860
No doubt you are

1263
01:52:35,050 --> 01:52:36,050
Is not it?

1264
01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:41,970
Where is Ragama's whereabouts?

1265
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:49,650
To make a documentary program bags
Get ready and do not work

1266
01:52:49,670 --> 01:52:54,850
Mike sleep sleeping
 Ready to cook a tent

1267
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:59,280
What's the secret number?

1268
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:00,950
You know

1269
01:53:01,530 --> 01:53:02,720
Your card

1270
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:16,830
Sorry

1271
01:53:16,970 --> 01:53:17,970
Which way goes to Kommandy?

1272
01:53:17,990 --> 01:53:19,750
straight away
- OK, thank you

1273
01:53:19,950 --> 01:53:22,050
This too is just like us

1274
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:24,750
That means
- Why do not you ask her about this dispute

1275
01:53:25,510 --> 01:53:26,510
Right

1276
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:31,690
Pay Rs. 5 for playing cards and losing it
Busy Reddie cut his head off from a bit of bitterness

1277
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:33,810
His head is Corporal Kommandi
Brought to the police

1278
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:37,650
Name Siddy Reddy ..
He's a good card player

1279
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:40,450
Trust me if the cards are
Get him in his hands

1280
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,660
This is how the conflict started

1281
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:44,590
It is also a question of Rs. 500 argument

1282
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:46,260
And what about Raga Reddy?

1283
01:53:46,450 --> 01:53:49,660
Forget it, the maid is his first
Ask Dad what he did

1284
01:53:49,950 --> 01:53:53,730
One of our Pasadurdy's dead
We're going to kill two of them

1285
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:55,780
Why should another Panchayat get this?

1286
01:53:56,080 --> 01:54:01,020
Dad ... Dad look at his eyes so much
People are kidding, they do not care

1287
01:54:01,070 --> 01:54:03,680
Why are you staring at me?

1288
01:54:03,710 --> 01:54:07,350
Tell your son
Dad, you do not know

1289
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:10,820
Five of you are locked up in darkness, Siva Reddy

1290
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:14,360
It's not normal, it's dark

1291
01:54:14,830 --> 01:54:16,660
Badr
- Get out

1292
01:54:17,690 --> 01:54:20,910
That's angry Thima Redady, Bashediddi

1293
01:54:21,310 --> 01:54:22,890
He was kissing the daylight

1294
01:54:27,910 --> 01:54:29,420
So did not they file a complaint?

1295
01:54:29,630 --> 01:54:32,240
What kind of case, ma'am, is here

1296
01:54:32,270 --> 01:54:34,210
This lady does not know what works here

1297
01:54:34,530 --> 01:54:36,970
She killed her father, Reddy

1298
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,900
Therefore, it's the Red River's father
Nagappa Reddy was killed

1299
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:42,050
And what else was the same?

1300
01:54:43,530 --> 01:54:45,030
do not Cry

1301
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:47,510
It's time out

1302
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:51,260
Where is Reddy? Where is Subaru?

1303
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:55,030
Komedadne must shift to the death of his father

1304
01:54:55,050 --> 01:54:57,350
The whole election was going on

1305
01:54:57,500 --> 01:55:01,870
But when I got in, I knocked down Reddy
They were killed because they were claiming to come forward

1306
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:10,040
Reddy lost it
I did not

1307
01:55:10,130 --> 01:55:11,930
He's Trim Reddy's grandson

1308
01:55:12,010 --> 01:55:15,550
He has the strength of Grandma
They cut everything off

1309
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:18,450
That's great
Getting the bodies in the car

1310
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:20,900
Everywhere a village was wet with tears

1311
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:21,960
After that

1312
01:55:21,990 --> 01:55:25,650
What do you know ...
For the last six months, she was not seen

1313
01:55:36,250 --> 01:55:37,730
Hey, sorry ...

1314
01:55:38,310 --> 01:55:40,000
I'm sorry to stop

1315
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:41,840
Please stop

1316
01:55:43,030 --> 01:55:45,650
When he told me, Reddy went away
Why are you leaving?

1317
01:55:47,180 --> 01:55:49,100
That's when I said things

1318
01:55:49,790 --> 01:55:51,460
Chinaman has gone from here

1319
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:53,360
Is not this the fight?

1320
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:55,750
There's no one here to hear that word

1321
01:55:56,230 --> 01:55:58,590
That all of this was a meeting

1322
01:55:59,010 --> 01:56:03,030
The people of Narpanza Reddy's are Anantapuram
He was killed in the lounge

1323
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:06,090
His name's also little
This is Raga Reddy

1324
01:56:06,730 --> 01:56:09,950
Seven years ago in peace
We fought that they should live

1325
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:13,570
He killed a man under a lorry

1326
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:22,330
Come on, let's go
- What happened?

1327
01:56:22,660 --> 01:56:25,080
Let me tell you later, let's go from here first
- Speaking

1328
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:27,750
What are you talking about?

1329
01:56:28,410 --> 01:56:31,830
Today, our Rage Reddit came with Reddy's son
And this is for a meeting

1330
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:34,030
When
- today

1331
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:42,920
Sudharshan Reddy
- Welcome

1332
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:44,240
Come on

1333
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:02,290
It's not Signal

1334
01:57:25,170 --> 01:57:26,760
Come on, Ragda, Reddy

1335
01:57:28,110 --> 01:57:30,720
Hey ... hey ... he's going out

1336
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:39,350
Why are Ragda Reddy these meetings?

1337
01:57:39,430 --> 01:57:41,620
From your father's time, it's Kandah
The advantage is on your side

1338
01:57:41,870 --> 01:57:43,600
Why should I have peace with them?

1339
01:57:43,630 --> 01:57:46,440
Sudarshan Reddy not about losing this matter

1340
01:57:47,550 --> 01:57:48,760
About living

1341
01:57:49,540 --> 01:57:52,070
This is even worse for this generation
How can I stop?

1342
01:57:56,830 --> 01:58:00,020
He made a decision that we did not give him a hand

1343
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:02,440
This meeting is not going to work

1344
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:09,790
Do you know about this meeting Pasredure?

1345
01:58:09,870 --> 01:58:12,630
I still do not know when the two first arrive at an agreement

1346
01:58:13,580 --> 01:58:15,680
Come to agreement with the man
Come with me, Krishna Reddy

1347
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:21,710
He tried to kill my dad

1348
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,570
He told me to kill my kids
- Balaradiddi

1349
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:27,950
The guy will be killed here

1350
01:58:28,410 --> 01:58:29,410
Going to jail

1351
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:31,760
My father was a minister

1352
01:58:32,610 --> 01:58:34,840
Bail out and come out

1353
01:58:35,530 --> 01:58:37,500
Sarabā
- Brother

1354
01:58:37,550 --> 01:58:39,060
Give me a knife

1355
02:00:04,570 --> 02:00:06,390
You and I will go to jail

1356
02:00:07,610 --> 02:00:10,320
My aunt's minister
I'm also getting bail out

1357
02:00:11,210 --> 02:00:12,580
That's not just for you

1358
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:14,670
I have

1359
02:00:21,930 --> 02:00:23,600
Tell you a story?

1360
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:26,740
Two acres of land

1361
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:30,490
You can not go on your own

1362
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:33,780
He took his wife to work

1363
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:36,880
His six year old daughter

1364
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:39,220
I was at home

1365
02:00:39,950 --> 02:00:42,530
Waiting for a full month brother

1366
02:00:43,170 --> 02:00:44,360
To cry

1367
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:46,700
She came out with him

1368
02:00:47,220 --> 02:00:49,340
I got the girls

1369
02:00:51,230 --> 02:00:53,980
Politics fight a bomb
In a village like this

1370
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,430
Find a bus somewhere, Reddy

1371
02:00:59,810 --> 02:01:02,040
10 km away in the hospital

1372
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:05,310
When I take Cymes to the hospital

1373
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:07,840
Doctor said that it was too late

1374
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:11,360
His brother cried

1375
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:15,200
Tell me this story again?

1376
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:18,250
Two acres are farmers

1377
02:01:19,450 --> 02:01:21,380
Currant water is in need

1378
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:24,470
Wives are left alone alone

1379
02:01:25,190 --> 02:01:27,650
Cultivate going to Ubudu

1380
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:31,320
Mom keeps things home from home

1381
02:01:32,610 --> 02:01:34,110
My daughter went to school

1382
02:01:35,210 --> 02:01:36,780
He's playing in the sun on the sun
There can be

1383
02:01:37,630 --> 02:01:39,230
He got to himself

1384
02:01:40,570 --> 02:01:42,980
This village has no politics
Not a fight or a separate fight

1385
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:45,780
There are so many buses

1386
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:48,920
I took the kid with the hospital

1387
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:51,990
He was provided with Doctor Salon

1388
02:01:52,810 --> 02:01:54,250
I was sent home

1389
02:01:55,210 --> 02:01:56,570
The next morning ...

1390
02:01:57,170 --> 02:01:58,400
The child went to study

1391
02:01:59,580 --> 02:02:00,830
Mom too laughing

1392
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:04,990
Your father wrote the first story

1393
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:07,680
The second one

1394
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:09,560
I'm trying to write

1395
02:02:10,830 --> 02:02:12,280
What do you want to do Baladradi?

1396
02:02:12,990 --> 02:02:14,300
Tell yourself

1397
02:02:17,730 --> 02:02:19,990
Yeah ... what my father did wrong

1398
02:02:21,230 --> 02:02:23,130
He killed a man for Rs. 500

1399
02:02:24,380 --> 02:02:25,800
And what did your dad do?

1400
02:02:26,350 --> 02:02:28,270
They killed two men who did not have anything to do with it

1401
02:02:29,060 --> 02:02:30,250
What do they say?

1402
02:02:30,730 --> 02:02:32,020
We started right

1403
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:33,790
Have you stopped?

1404
02:02:34,410 --> 02:02:35,730
We've been killed and accepted

1405
02:02:36,140 --> 02:02:37,530
Are you out of your mind?

1406
02:02:37,970 --> 02:02:39,560
He hit again, did not he?

1407
02:02:40,030 --> 02:02:41,330
Why Rage Reddy?

1408
02:02:41,970 --> 02:02:43,890
Why not talk?

1409
02:02:46,460 --> 02:02:47,460
I'm very sorry

1410
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:57,500
I'm no longer my dad anymore

1411
02:02:58,190 --> 02:03:00,490
Even if you do not come here
And apologize to my father

1412
02:03:07,150 --> 02:03:10,850
Your dad followed that murder case
My dad sat on it and talked to him

1413
02:03:11,470 --> 02:03:13,730
These people live in 20 villages
Life could have changed

1414
02:03:15,180 --> 02:03:17,610
At least give our children even that opportunity

1415
02:03:21,330 --> 02:03:22,580
The value of this peace

1416
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:24,700
Five years

1417
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:26,400
Member of Parliament

1418
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:27,670
A minister

1419
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:29,160
I like

1420
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:31,490
I'm not competing

1421
02:03:32,030 --> 02:03:33,030
You win

1422
02:03:33,060 --> 02:03:35,190
This is not what it was before. Why do not you read it, Reddy

1423
02:03:35,610 --> 02:03:37,740
You've been here for the past
I got a couple of vehicles, and I'm a little Reddy

1424
02:03:38,050 --> 02:03:39,320
I talked

1425
02:03:39,820 --> 02:03:43,470
This is why this road took 4 vehicles this time
Talk like this

1426
02:03:44,780 --> 02:03:46,620
To the one who seeks the war

1427
02:03:47,220 --> 02:03:48,920
There is no right to call for peace

1428
02:03:52,530 --> 02:03:54,020
He has my phone number

1429
02:03:55,170 --> 02:03:56,400
Put a mask

1430
02:03:57,540 --> 02:03:59,040
If yes, yes

1431
02:03:59,790 --> 02:04:02,800
After you leave MLA this right
Let's go meet your father

1432
02:04:03,570 --> 02:04:04,570
If you do not answer

1433
02:04:05,450 --> 02:04:09,030
From the pillow, in the case of tougher cuts
Until Collie Reddy's circling

1434
02:04:09,340 --> 02:04:13,020
From Kanda Reddy colony of Karna
 Ananda Pumble Chab tower

1435
02:04:13,580 --> 02:04:17,170
They are hiding in the battles but in Belagampalan
Not even a handful in the middle

1436
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:19,560
Hunting

1437
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:21,840
The neck is broken first

1438
02:04:34,730 --> 02:04:39,020
Krisna Reddy all this time
In my political life

1439
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:42,690
No one from the area

1440
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:45,720
I did not see him taking revenge

1441
02:04:46,790 --> 02:04:47,790
For the first time

1442
02:04:49,550 --> 02:04:51,100
This is the first time

1443
02:04:54,790 --> 02:04:58,030
At one time
The goal is changing

1444
02:04:59,370 --> 02:05:02,670
The trump says in the film field
The business is in style

1445
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:07,680
Politicians say that it's a clan ..
Generations say

1446
02:05:08,430 --> 02:05:13,000
But it was new to each generation
To take an objective in the past ..

1447
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:14,860
One is coming

1448
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:17,370
His best player is

1449
02:05:18,450 --> 02:05:20,820
You see, Baleraddy

1450
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:22,540
This

1451
02:05:23,350 --> 02:05:24,820
That's the best player

1452
02:05:34,410 --> 02:05:37,630
The sword of your province and powerful peace are powerful

1453
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:40,750
He decides

1454
02:05:41,510 --> 02:05:44,300
Still not normal, Baleraddy

1455
02:05:45,230 --> 02:05:47,300
Milk it is not a cat

1456
02:05:48,140 --> 02:05:49,410
Tiger

1457
02:05:50,060 --> 02:05:51,580
Blood

1458
02:05:53,120 --> 02:05:54,800
And then your will

1459
02:06:02,230 --> 02:06:03,350
Hello ..
- Raga

1460
02:06:03,450 --> 02:06:04,450
Yes, yes.
How are you?

1461
02:06:04,730 --> 02:06:05,980
Why am I alright?

1462
02:06:07,060 --> 02:06:09,310
How is she?
- All right

1463
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:10,800
She's not been through anything

1464
02:06:10,820 --> 02:06:14,940
You have a meeting with Bassurabedi's son
We were scared here, we were

1465
02:06:16,470 --> 02:06:17,470
That's not where are you?

1466
02:06:17,660 --> 02:06:18,660
Comanche came

1467
02:06:21,660 --> 02:06:22,890
Why did you go there?

1468
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:25,830
Can my mother-in-law's village come for me?

1469
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:29,020
Awi, this is not normal
Listen carefully to what I say

1470
02:06:29,730 --> 02:06:32,440
You'll first come to our house in the morning

1471
02:06:32,680 --> 02:06:35,220
There my men are there
Tell them to call me

1472
02:06:35,690 --> 02:06:36,690
Got it?

1473
02:06:36,990 --> 02:06:38,130
Raghavan

1474
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:39,620
Abe, I'm just saying ....
- You understand ...

1475
02:10:32,970 --> 02:10:36,320
The village is so beautiful
People like to be peaceful

1476
02:10:36,940 --> 02:10:39,610
Is this a fight like this?

1477
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:42,900
Is not it that you are very sad?

1478
02:10:46,710 --> 02:10:49,130
Start ... Where ... Start

1479
02:10:49,450 --> 02:10:50,720
Why Breakaway Failed

1480
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:53,790
Come on, daughter
- Thank you very much

1481
02:10:55,450 --> 02:10:56,450
It needs to be built

1482
02:10:57,070 --> 02:10:58,650
Are you eating?

1483
02:11:02,130 --> 02:11:05,090
Eat here ... A lot of food here is delicious
Listen, listen

1484
02:11:09,620 --> 02:11:12,070
The car is broken

1485
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:14,910
It came with a bit of fixing it

1486
02:11:18,900 --> 02:11:19,900
Who is it?

1487
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:25,220
Do not you even know the name? Sin

1488
02:11:25,420 --> 02:11:26,550
Please, town girl

1489
02:11:26,780 --> 02:11:29,130
Not knowing your name here
Do not talk about your husband's name

1490
02:11:29,700 --> 02:11:33,450
Tomorrow you'll marry Veera Raga Reddy
Do not say ... it's not right

1491
02:11:34,110 --> 02:11:35,450
My husband

1492
02:11:36,160 --> 02:11:37,160
My interest

1493
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:39,480
Talk to me

1494
02:11:39,730 --> 02:11:42,650
Because somebody is yours
Is the fight over?

1495
02:11:48,580 --> 02:11:49,940
I was trembling to see

1496
02:11:49,970 --> 02:11:52,020
Oh, drink time

1497
02:11:57,380 --> 02:11:59,490
Do not cry

1498
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:08,060
Is that the voice of A Bunny?

1499
02:12:08,090 --> 02:12:09,220
Hey now

1500
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:11,100
Like it?

1501
02:12:15,810 --> 02:12:16,810
That's Ragavaddee

1502
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:17,990
Hey

1503
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:20,610
Do not scare me anymore

1504
02:12:22,420 --> 02:12:24,900
Just scared
A man needs some

1505
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:26,210
is it?

1506
02:12:26,860 --> 02:12:28,590
is it? is it?

1507
02:12:28,620 --> 02:12:29,870
Subbā

1508
02:12:29,910 --> 02:12:31,060
That's enough

1509
02:12:32,110 --> 02:12:35,770
Yes, that's all. That's it. That's all

1510
02:12:49,070 --> 02:12:50,300
What happened?

1511
02:12:50,710 --> 02:12:52,510
It's awkward

1512
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:54,400
Want money?

1513
02:12:56,580 --> 02:12:57,580
You can not endure big brother

1514
02:12:58,380 --> 02:13:00,150
Can not look at the eyes

1515
02:13:03,510 --> 02:13:04,510
What happened?

1516
02:13:05,670 --> 02:13:10,160
Ganderkeda are the people of Obedeli
I'm killing myself, my husband

1517
02:13:10,180 --> 02:13:11,600
No, who said Bun?

1518
02:13:12,290 --> 02:13:13,540
That Subo's Evvo

1519
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:19,130
why?
- We are kidding on the day we returned from the city when they ran away

1520
02:13:19,150 --> 02:13:21,790
Better not dead
- why?

1521
02:13:21,820 --> 02:13:24,990
Listen to her voice
- Whose voice

1522
02:13:26,760 --> 02:13:30,000
When you hear that Ragawa Reddy's voice
I'm shaking hands

1523
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:34,700
But is the launch finished?

1524
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:39,830
He's afraid to marry him
It's true that the girl got off

1525
02:13:40,190 --> 02:13:42,490
But these are also what's really great

1526
02:13:42,660 --> 02:13:45,890
Not even in the car
Did not have a stiffness to stop anyone?

1527
02:13:46,840 --> 02:13:47,840
Your son
- Hey

1528
02:13:49,160 --> 02:13:52,140
That rude did not make it, Reddy
Lied

1529
02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:55,720
The man did not open his hand
What is your son doing?

1530
02:13:55,750 --> 02:13:57,820
What are you talking about?

1531
02:14:02,250 --> 02:14:07,040
Your son, without your knowledge, with him
Talk to everyone

1532
02:14:07,370 --> 02:14:09,070
I'm not a traitor

1533
02:14:10,030 --> 02:14:11,660
Am I just wrong?

1534
02:14:14,180 --> 02:14:16,140
Bothellay, done at night, sir

1535
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:19,830
He attacked his head with crazy stuff

1536
02:14:20,990 --> 02:14:23,320
They're not really sure of me, mister

1537
02:14:23,980 --> 02:14:27,350
It will be removed from them
I want to lose my life

1538
02:14:29,870 --> 02:14:30,990
That's why

1539
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:33,880
You thought to get rid of you first

1540
02:14:37,780 --> 02:14:39,860
I'm sorry, gentleman

1541
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:42,540
I'm sorry, gentleman

1542
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:48,640
You did not have honor, Dad

1543
02:14:49,900 --> 02:14:51,840
Nobody to contest from this village

1544
02:14:52,230 --> 02:14:56,220
The leader of the party said that he could be MLA

1545
02:14:57,780 --> 02:14:59,760
It will not happen, Dad

1546
02:15:00,170 --> 02:15:03,950
Otherwise, that one
Redhouse Reddy told you to kill you

1547
02:15:06,790 --> 02:15:07,790
Fucking dad

1548
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:20,440
Kill

1549
02:15:21,870 --> 02:15:23,160
Dead

1550
02:15:25,280 --> 02:15:27,710
Does it feel like dying?
- Dad

1551
02:15:27,920 --> 02:15:29,220
Shortly thereafter

1552
02:15:30,170 --> 02:15:32,120
There is not a single feeling

1553
02:15:34,420 --> 02:15:35,860
But Baladradi

1554
02:15:37,510 --> 02:15:42,340
When I kill you, I would die.

1555
02:15:43,230 --> 02:15:45,520
You need to be dead

1556
02:15:48,680 --> 02:15:50,990
It's better to die Baladradi

1557
02:15:51,480 --> 02:15:54,430
But it's a shame to be afraid

1558
02:15:54,780 --> 02:15:57,600
It's a terrible disgrace

1559
02:16:01,820 --> 02:16:04,390
How did Baladridi deal with him?

1560
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:08,800
You should be a minister
But it's a god

1561
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:11,120
You have the power

1562
02:16:11,410 --> 02:16:13,340
But it's prestigious to go

1563
02:16:14,670 --> 02:16:15,870
Bālareḍḍi

1564
02:16:16,730 --> 02:16:21,450
Not everything has changed. Everything
There must be old stuff

1565
02:16:21,890 --> 02:16:24,590
Even if the kids revenge

1566
02:16:25,130 --> 02:16:27,040
Marion ... Marion ...

1567
02:16:43,010 --> 02:16:47,460
Because I'm sorry about her voice
I'm afraid to be scared

1568
02:16:48,150 --> 02:16:50,820
Now, I have not seen anything

1569
02:16:57,120 --> 02:16:59,500
Hey Baleraddy

1570
02:17:00,310 --> 02:17:02,480
Hey Paseurddi

1571
02:17:03,540 --> 02:17:06,150
He killed my son but the sinner

1572
02:17:06,270 --> 02:17:10,430
Do not you get up
Do not be so good at all

1573
02:17:10,610 --> 02:17:14,280
You had to die without killing my son

1574
02:17:14,550 --> 02:17:16,920
I've lost my life

1575
02:17:17,080 --> 02:17:18,660
Hey, get out

1576
02:17:21,590 --> 02:17:25,000
How many more are going to kill?

1577
02:17:27,010 --> 02:17:30,400
Please, my son ... son ... son ...

1578
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:05,640
Hello, Ariel

1579
02:18:06,090 --> 02:18:07,710
Raga Reddy

1580
02:18:12,590 --> 02:18:14,660
Going bumblebee?

1581
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:17,240
Do you commit my son?

1582
02:18:17,740 --> 02:18:19,450
Hiṭiyotnē

1583
02:18:21,530 --> 02:18:24,750
Because you killed my son

1584
02:18:25,690 --> 02:18:28,170
My village is home to your village

1585
02:18:28,400 --> 02:18:31,300
Honey is burning

1586
02:18:42,460 --> 02:18:44,390
Are you telling the truth?

1587
02:18:45,720 --> 02:18:47,580
I killed my son

1588
02:18:51,010 --> 02:18:53,580
There was a rumor to stop this fight

1589
02:18:54,280 --> 02:18:56,350
That peace does not come back

1590
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:04,800
Another change is what the bun ... go

1591
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:07,550
Change Pasuredee

1592
02:19:09,690 --> 02:19:11,650
How wonderful?

1593
02:19:12,750 --> 02:19:16,070
30 years ago, you
This is where it started

1594
02:19:20,680 --> 02:19:21,960
Let's change where we are

1595
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:24,890
Then there you are

1596
02:19:25,210 --> 02:19:28,390
What are you doing?
I'll take care of it

1597
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:55,900
Changed

1598
02:19:56,270 --> 02:19:57,540
What's changed?

1599
02:19:57,640 --> 02:19:59,150
Where have you changed?

1600
02:19:59,670 --> 02:20:01,230
When my father is gone

1601
02:20:01,960 --> 02:20:03,710
I did not kill myself
I do not know

1602
02:20:04,210 --> 02:20:05,910
I did not die

1603
02:20:06,370 --> 02:20:08,900
Your neck cut
I did not know that I was so angry

1604
02:20:09,620 --> 02:20:10,620
Do not you?

1605
02:20:12,220 --> 02:20:15,430
Because my grandmother was listening, I got my knife into the ground
I did not know myself

1606
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:17,240
Open your hand

1607
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:20,360
You're behind your back, girl

1608
02:20:21,090 --> 02:20:23,620
A fight can be stopped by discussing
I did not know when she called me

1609
02:20:24,360 --> 02:20:26,090
These days are not stopping

1610
02:20:28,480 --> 02:20:30,010
You're just changing

1611
02:20:30,680 --> 02:20:32,910
I do not know how that is. I do not know why Reddy

1612
02:20:33,690 --> 02:20:34,760
But I will

1613
02:20:35,420 --> 02:20:36,610
It's definite

1614
02:20:49,440 --> 02:20:51,980
At the hospital, on the hospital
From here are two miles

1615
02:20:52,340 --> 02:20:54,930
Two lives
Take us to death

1616
02:20:55,500 --> 02:20:58,280
Remember, you cut off the backpack

1617
02:20:58,410 --> 02:21:00,630
You heard your voice muddy trousers moist

1618
02:21:01,630 --> 02:21:04,000
This is the Biryadi who killed you

1619
02:21:04,370 --> 02:21:06,030
All three were added

1620
02:21:06,150 --> 02:21:06,840
Come

1621
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Kill

1622
02:21:10,180 --> 02:21:12,080
But before the kill

1623
02:21:12,390 --> 02:21:15,150
This is not the old Raga Reddy

1624
02:21:15,750 --> 02:21:17,520
Prasaddi's son was killed

1625
02:21:17,710 --> 02:21:21,380
The Rev. Rev.

1626
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:25,060
This is more than this
There will be a massive struggle

1627
02:21:25,560 --> 02:21:27,660
How's that gonna change, Reddy

1628
02:21:29,690 --> 02:21:33,120
But I've lost more time
Get off soon

1629
02:21:33,330 --> 02:21:35,370
This Subwoo's boyfriend, Patriot

1630
02:21:35,550 --> 02:21:37,410
When you grow older, who did this to you
Knowing

1631
02:21:37,670 --> 02:21:41,700
Everything came together after years
He starts bombing again

1632
02:21:41,820 --> 02:21:44,990
If you stop it, you're done

1633
02:21:45,230 --> 02:21:47,270
How's that gonna change?

1634
02:21:52,300 --> 02:21:56,040
500 rupees was not watered
Or righty, Reddy

1635
02:21:56,270 --> 02:22:00,440
The way it started 30 years ago
It's still here

1636
02:22:00,770 --> 02:22:03,900
This house is at home somewhere
It's operational

1637
02:22:04,120 --> 02:22:05,460
How's that gonna change?

1638
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:07,240
How can you change Reddy?

1639
02:22:08,360 --> 02:22:09,360
Come

1640
02:22:23,640 --> 02:22:26,550
The knife is also marketed here
Take it

1641
02:22:27,760 --> 02:22:28,760
Bitch

1642
02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:30,760
Bitch

1643
02:22:37,530 --> 02:22:38,530
Raghavan

1644
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,520
Not like the old road

1645
02:22:42,110 --> 02:22:44,050
This time you are near

1646
02:22:44,780 --> 02:22:46,360
I'm here

1647
02:22:46,790 --> 02:22:49,030
But you do not have to save

1648
02:22:49,630 --> 02:22:52,060
Everything about you happened

1649
02:22:54,280 --> 02:22:56,990
But just what you need to do
You yourself have to write

1650
02:22:57,870 --> 02:23:00,130
Write anything else

1651
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:04,770
What can I write?

1652
02:23:05,570 --> 02:23:09,490
When one man died, the ceremony
This is a village

1653
02:23:10,410 --> 02:23:11,980
What's New What?

1654
02:23:13,690 --> 02:23:16,420
Will their children live in the future?
He is also determined not to

1655
02:23:17,850 --> 02:23:21,250
We need to go to jail
He needs to live on bail

1656
02:23:21,880 --> 02:23:23,870
If the bomb explodes in his own hand

1657
02:23:25,850 --> 02:23:28,720
Submarine does not have any hands
There will be someone left Zubu

1658
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:33,320
What else can you write about me?

1659
02:23:35,650 --> 02:23:37,330
The eyes of the eyes are full of dust

1660
02:23:38,310 --> 02:23:40,400
Houses that are not even eaten

1661
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:42,620
This is a scorching village

1662
02:23:42,650 --> 02:23:45,130
This is an animal that dwells in its blood

1663
02:23:47,210 --> 02:23:48,590
What's new about Ari

1664
02:23:50,740 --> 02:23:52,940
It's me, I think, to make this plentiful land in this village

1665
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:54,820
But this knife is about to be used for this purpose

1666
02:23:57,100 --> 02:23:58,550
What else is left to write

1667
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:01,950
I do not know who this is

1668
02:24:02,840 --> 02:24:03,840
Change

1669
02:24:04,910 --> 02:24:06,090
To kill them?

1670
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:09,210
To save two men
Three men to kill?

1671
02:24:10,970 --> 02:24:12,280
This is the war I do not want

1672
02:24:13,110 --> 02:24:15,100
Here only the sounds of death are heard

1673
02:24:16,060 --> 02:24:17,320
What can I write?

1674
02:24:20,230 --> 02:24:21,230
Hey, Karappa

1675
02:24:23,490 --> 02:24:25,260
What are you waiting for?

1676
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:28,170
He killed his father

1677
02:24:29,940 --> 02:24:32,440
He's dancing tears for me

1678
02:24:33,820 --> 02:24:37,530
If she goes on her way, we will
Life can survive

1679
02:24:38,440 --> 02:24:39,440
Get it

1680
02:25:02,740 --> 02:25:03,740
Day mara

1681
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:08,140
They thought my kids were you
Do you oppose me all?

1682
02:25:09,260 --> 02:25:11,150
You are a son who has been killed without a heart

1683
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:13,080
I'm talking like a son

1684
02:25:14,110 --> 02:25:15,110
Am I a bastard?

1685
02:25:20,340 --> 02:25:21,560
ELT

1686
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:40,330
Little mister

1687
02:25:40,570 --> 02:25:41,930
Nothing happens to your people

1688
02:25:42,350 --> 02:25:43,750
That's what I promise

1689
02:25:44,250 --> 02:25:46,770
Give this a good word
Like protecting it, it protects it

1690
02:25:47,220 --> 02:25:48,610
See if you want to see it

1691
02:26:03,310 --> 02:26:04,310
Hey Suba

1692
02:26:04,970 --> 02:26:09,040
For 30 years, I looked after my son
How are you doing?

1693
02:26:09,410 --> 02:26:11,070
How?
Basureḍḍi

1694
02:26:12,770 --> 02:26:14,210
How did you know how to change it?

1695
02:26:15,260 --> 02:26:16,260
Says

1696
02:26:17,590 --> 02:26:18,590
Says

1697
02:26:19,930 --> 02:26:22,320
Listen to what you say and change
I'm not Balaradevi

1698
02:26:22,980 --> 02:26:25,130
Cry tears of the eyes
I'm not sweet

1699
02:26:25,630 --> 02:26:28,480
Stay thirsty for the Bessuredi bun

1700
02:26:28,510 --> 02:26:32,480
How to change

1701
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:40,070
Says

1702
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Bottled

1703
02:26:45,270 --> 02:26:48,760
Talk to your son
There was a desire to make a difference here

1704
02:26:50,410 --> 02:26:51,960
You killed her

1705
02:26:53,820 --> 02:26:57,270
Against the back of one hand
Seeing them had the same desire

1706
02:26:59,230 --> 02:27:01,220
Do not let him kill Busteradei

1707
02:27:03,020 --> 02:27:05,100
That's why you're killing yourself

1708
02:27:06,180 --> 02:27:08,380
You were living here
No peace will come

1709
02:27:09,820 --> 02:27:12,250
You know that you are dead

1710
02:27:14,330 --> 02:27:15,670
You have to live

1711
02:27:16,510 --> 02:27:17,780
And also need to die

1712
02:27:18,340 --> 02:27:22,910
That's why you live in death
Do not tell anyone

1713
02:27:27,890 --> 02:27:31,400
Take revenge on my father's death
You did not kill yourself, Paseurbedi

1714
02:27:33,380 --> 02:27:35,540
Your son is killed because he was killed.

1715
02:27:37,450 --> 02:27:41,170
Will others have their sons killed?
They're frightened

1716
02:29:38,770 --> 02:29:39,770
Hey

1717
02:29:41,540 --> 02:29:44,080
Come with only those who believe

1718
02:29:57,370 --> 02:29:59,780
My husband killed my son and ran away

1719
02:30:03,650 --> 02:30:05,850
This is the record to write

1720
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:09,710
Come on, Mom
- to where?

1721
02:30:11,140 --> 02:30:12,140
Give nominations

1722
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:17,990
Do not make decisions from Ragawaddy Gama

1723
02:30:18,090 --> 02:30:20,220
But what does he know?

1724
02:30:21,850 --> 02:30:24,300
What we do know, Sir, over there with him

1725
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:26,000
My grandmother

1726
02:30:27,010 --> 02:30:29,740
His brothers died, but his own son died

1727
02:30:30,030 --> 02:30:33,280
It is not for such a god to worship God

1728
02:30:34,060 --> 02:30:36,300
I did not wish to have Brasurevedy, sir

1729
02:30:38,250 --> 02:30:39,250
My mother

1730
02:30:40,090 --> 02:30:42,210
Daddy was raped, not crying

1731
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:45,800
PAZEUREDDI: Think about taking revenge
Not at all

1732
02:30:47,640 --> 02:30:48,640
My aunt

1733
02:30:49,880 --> 02:30:52,180
Somebody's at home

1734
02:30:53,060 --> 02:30:55,030
To destroy the food
Not at all

1735
02:30:57,550 --> 02:30:59,010
Now this is mom

1736
02:31:00,130 --> 02:31:04,040
They killed my son and my husband
Come here and fight to stop

1737
02:31:04,590 --> 02:31:07,360
Whatever the village is for me
I did not miss it

1738
02:31:08,190 --> 02:31:09,950
You and the police know that sir

1739
02:31:10,760 --> 02:31:13,200
It's wrong to create an incorrect post

1740
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:16,780
A mother who gave her blood, sir

1741
02:31:18,190 --> 02:31:19,590
What can not be

1742
02:31:23,860 --> 02:31:25,130
This is where the MLA is here

1743
02:31:27,230 --> 02:31:31,140
No one has my family in my village
Do not stand out

1744
02:31:32,990 --> 02:31:34,610
Anybody there?

And the ghost story

1749
02:32:15,090 --> 02:32:16,650
Are the people who were sent to the school in Brasuradue?

1750
02:32:17,250 --> 02:32:19,910
They have a door that can be pulled

1751
02:32:20,320 --> 02:32:22,390
Another door locker

1752
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:24,720
Eat foods for weeks

1753
02:32:24,970 --> 02:32:28,840
Get out of there, too
Their eyes were forever

1754
02:32:33,980 --> 02:32:36,230
Today they see how to solve it

1755
02:32:36,500 --> 02:32:37,500
That's why it came

1756
02:32:56,910 --> 02:32:58,610
Now they come out with something, Coreot

1757
02:32:58,730 --> 02:33:01,210
The person who survived is back
I'm not going to sink

1758
02:33:01,940 --> 02:33:02,940
This is not me

1759
02:33:03,730 --> 02:33:04,730
He said

1760
02:33:26,710 --> 02:33:27,930
For revenge

1761
02:33:29,290 --> 02:33:31,710
You take the knife again to this address
