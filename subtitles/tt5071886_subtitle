1
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,043
The reason why
we are here today is...

2
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,811
...this man, Kabali

3
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,087
He influenced the society
to oppose the Govt

4
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,606
He was also accused of
instigating a ruthless massacre...

5
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,763
...in a palm oil estate
during a Hindu temple festival

6
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,649
For this offense...

7
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,969
...he was sentenced to
25 years of imprisonment

8
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,401
And he is being
released this Wednesday

9
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,127
Kabali's family was killed
in the same massacre

10
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,489
By the leader of
the gang 43, Tony Lee

11
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,930
'Tony Lee has invested...'

12
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,401
'...in many industries'

13
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,965
'Such as hotels'

14
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,770
'Import and export'

15
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,481
'Prostitution'

16
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,085
'Criminal activities'

17
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,730
'And drug trafficking'

18
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,689
'Veerasekaran is a pillar
of strength to Tony Lee'

19
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,840
'Many places are under his control
including Petaling street'

20
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,600
'With these 2 men
working for him...'

21
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,526
'...Veerasekaran's criminal activities
in Malaysia spread like the plague'

22
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,489
'One of them is Loga'

23
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,360
'He is the one who controls
drug trafficking for gang 43'

24
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,649
'Loga fixes the market price
for drugs in Malaysia'

25
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,165
'Another is Cheeni'

26
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,089
'He is involved in gangsterism'

27
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,363
'Loan shark activities,
leasing of parking space illegally'

28
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,887
'Recruiting school students
to join gang 43'

29
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,601
'A few years ago
the activities of these gangs...'

30
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,490
'...spread like wild fire
beyond the control of the Govt'

31
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,527
'To have an upper hand, the Govt and
Police planned a special Operation'

32
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,808
'In a clash between the Police and
the gangsters, Veerasekaran escaped'

33
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,851
'And Tony Lee died in a car crash'

34
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,762
This is the death certificate given by
the Police endorsing Tony Lee's death

35
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,043
We don't have to talk
about gang 43...understand?

36
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,683
Can we concentrate on
more important issues now?

37
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,168
Do you really think Kabali will
be quiet when he gets out of prison?

38
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,208
No...no...no
Though he is in prison...

39
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,567
...he uses his influence
to help Indian people

40
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,041
Specially the youngsters
who drop out of schools

41
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,565
And join gangsterism

42
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,007
He does all these things
with the help of his friend Amir

43
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,407
And an organization called
Free Life Foundation

44
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,244
'His thoughts and
vision have changed'

45
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,647
Furthermore
the problem is for him

46
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,451
They have tried to kill him
13 times inside the prison

47
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,369
Let's release him

48
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,651
Why waste time
talking about an old man?

49
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,210
Might as well release him

50
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,084
The Govt will take other measures

51
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,207
If needed

52
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,887
Hello...?

53
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,091
(song from 'Adutha Varisu')

54
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,686
Hello?

55
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,005
Hey! Ask him to stop

56
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,046
Hello?

57
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,366
Yes, huh?

58
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,289
Kabali is coming out tomorrow?

59
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,442
Confirmed?

60
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,760
Whaaat!
Kabali, huh?

61
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,046
Okay, bro

62
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,640
Fantastic!

63
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,125
Is he coming out tomorrow?

64
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,486
Heavyweight, bro

65
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,526
Yes, bro?

66
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,961
He is out tomorrow

67
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,082
Let us close his chapter a.s.a.p

68
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,162
We can show him
the power of 43!

69
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,610
My: bro?

70
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,682
Okay, bro

71
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,608
Fine!

72
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,481
Brow?

73
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,881
Just 2 months

74
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,007
I'll be out

75
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,963
I'll stick out
my head for you

76
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,970
Definitely I'll be there for you

77
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,326
Just a matter of time

78
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,961
'Quiet!'

79
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,686
Here

80
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,482
Should have been holed up here
till your last breath

81
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,324
You are really fortunate
to get out so soon

82
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,880
Recently 40 thugs were
killed in an encounter

83
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,803
More than 30 were Tamilians

84
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,087
Any Tamilian is being
branded a villain now

85
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,725
Though I am a police officer...

86
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,041
...sometimes they look
at me suspiciously too

87
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,202
This is an earnest request from me

88
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,567
Don't go back to
your old ways again

89
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,568
I'm saying this
only for your own good

90
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,446
(cool chuckle)

91
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,681
Cheers...!

92
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,683
You're being targeted
by the 43 gan-

93
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,841
Ssshhhh!

94
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,487
'Anna...?'

95
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,482
Amir

96
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,050
Good to have you back

97
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,201
Allah's will!

98
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,281
(happy laughter)

99
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,646
Can I hug you
just once?

100
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,165
By all means hug me

101
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,811
You are back, anna
This is enough for me

102
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,121
Thank God

103
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,049
Ravi, your hair has turned grey!

104
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,282
- How are you?
- You guys rock!

105
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,529
All your blessings, anna
We are good, thanks to you

106
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,961
They are all our boys
Totally trustworthy

107
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,121
Good...good

108
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,163
He teaches in our school

109
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,045
- Good afternoon, sir
- He wanted to meet you

110
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,651
You feel good, anna?

111
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,046
What do you think?

112
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,685
Awesome, anna

113
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,091
- My car, right?
- Yes, anna

114
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,761
Just like you, perfect condition
Your favorite lovebird

115
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,245
Sooopefl

116
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,768
'Everybody is waiting to see you
Our area is in a festive mood'

117
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,207
'Even representatives
from all the gangs'

118
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,969
Anna, look over there

119
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,287
Where Murugan's saloon used to be

120
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,765
'Chettiar gardens'

121
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,162
Look over here

122
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,442
This was our Tamilnesan sir's area

123
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,568
KL has changed so much, right?

124
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,890
Anna, look there

125
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,764
Peddling drugs
in broad daylight

126
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,411
Even kids are into this

127
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,330
'Doomsday is nearing
They belong to 43 gang'

128
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,569
Such is life now!

129
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,130
'Students in our Free Life school are
junkies from gangs we have rehabilitated'

130
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,124
'Anna, look at that'

131
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,960
If interest for a loan
is not repaid in time...

132
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,162
...that red paint is awarning

133
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,850
If he defaults payment even then
you bet his chapter will be closed

134
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,291
Courtesy 43

135
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,881
Tony Lee
Veerasekaran

136
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,805
Besides them
ring leader Cheeni

137
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,167
You can find him
in the pet shop now

138
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,449
Where is that pet shop?

139
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,490
'That's his hangout'

140
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,925
'The pet shop is a mask'

141
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,082
'All illegal activities inside
including smuggling'

142
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,091
- Let him go
- Take your hands off

143
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,810
Check what's happening...go

144
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,531
Imagine imprisoning birds
that were flying free

145
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,329
No punishment is good enough

146
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,448
Know how tough it is
to be caged?

147
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,489
A door with small bars

148
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,449
If opened, vast blue skies

149
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,123
They will die if freed, anna
Other birds will peck them to death

150
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,766
A bird's nature is to fly
Let it go, free it

151
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,491
Let the bird decide
whether to fly or fall dead

152
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,002
Your compassion
is worse than its death!

153
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,651
'All is 1 package'

154
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,281
'Orangutan special price, okay?'

155
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,926
Don't worry

156
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,286
'I will take care'

157
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,051
Ah! Look!

158
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,843
Lamb for the slaughter is here

159
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,322
- Would you like something to drink?
- Can we get hot tea?

160
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,084
With just 1 teaspoon sugar

161
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,686
Don't want, anna?

162
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,883
We changed our mind, no need

163
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,121
Looks like you came
straight to my den?

164
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,965
What can I do for you?

165
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,725
(lamb bleating)

166
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,763
Then you bloody well die!

167
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,083
(smug laughter)

168
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,520
Atypical thug in Tamil films, with wart,
twirling his moustache, 'lungi' clad

169
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,047
As soon as villain Nambiyar
calls out, 'Hey! Kabali!'

170
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,010
...that thug will grovel and say
'At your service, master'

171
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,202
You thought I was 'that' Kabali!

172
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,970
I am KABALI, I say

173
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,246
Inform your boss, Kabali has returned
ditto as he left 25 years ago

174
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,160
"Like fire blazing fiercely"

175
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,369
Whichever nook or corner
Tony Lee and Veerasekaran are...

176
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,289
...they have to bow before me!

177
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,200
"Gather"

178
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,881
Lamb, huh?

179
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,525
"Garner"

180
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,124
"Comrade!"

181
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,490
"ls world for a handful
or masses who toil?"

182
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,210
"Reply will be
from the lips of Kabali!"

183
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,284
"Revolt and raise hell
0ppressor's rule he'll quell"

184
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,205
"ls the world for one
Or those who sweat in the sun?"

185
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,964
"Answer will be
from the heart of Kabali!"

186
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,884
"With a mutiny he designs
the overlord's death he signs"

187
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,609
"Like a towering inferno
you blazed aglow"

188
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,851
"Even if eyes close
dreams don't doze"

189
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,562
"As a flower appeasing"

190
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,041
"As a flute mesmerizing"

191
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,130
"Show the world who you are
Don't be a lamb for the slaughter"

192
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,563
"Like a tree dwelling in a seed
we carry stories to repeat"

193
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,565
"Tomorrow's dawn is ours to revel
Revolt, break rules to rebel"

194
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,882
"The sky is yours to hold sway"

195
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,604
"A bird won't forget to fly half way"

196
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,287
"Up his sleeve, many a scheme
Here comes Kabali, greet him"

197
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,121
"Like a spinning top nonstop
beat the drum, sing a song"

198
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,081
"So many years in prison
He's back now in action"

199
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,322
"In fear
his foes shiver"

200
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,641
"Our blood boils to sever"

201
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,683
"Kabali"

202
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,644
"Super star's the name
This is his game"

203
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,122
"Kabali the visionary!"

204
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,403
"King of our time
In the concrete jungle"

205
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,567
"Watching over my pride"

206
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,967
"How does it matter to you
which place I belong to?"

207
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,321
"He lent a hand as a Tamilian
to his clan in this land"

208
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,323
"I am stalking my prey
Won't let them get away"

209
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,528
"Vtflth the things that they do
Bad moves that they make"

210
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,523
"We let others live
We gladly gave in"

211
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,046
"Now I'll live life to the fullest
Zip your lips and focus"

212
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,769
"Dressed to kill"

213
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,081
"Call it Kabali swag
Come and get some"

214
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,167
"Like the K-town clan"

215
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,288
"It ain't about the size
of the dog in the fight"

216
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,761
"But the spirit of the fight
in the dog that's right"

217
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,683
"Root and flower
Don't differ"

218
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,286
"Though grey of the clouds somber
pure drops of rain shower"

219
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,762
"Will waves be kept at bay
by a repressive force anyway?"

220
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,366
"Water current forever powerful"

221
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,046
"To swim past you is impossible"

222
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,205
"Can a snowflake small
snuff a volcano tall?"

223
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,684
"The elite order's furor
won't be heard here anymore"

224
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,845
"Tamil race and its identity
will now become reality"

225
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,364
"Rich men's cry of power
won't be heard in future"

226
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,445
"Tamil clan's address
will now spell success"

227
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,281
"Within a seed's womb
like a flower we bloom"

228
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,768
"History from the tomb"

229
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,726
"Tomorrow's dawn is ours to revel
Surge, break rules to rebel"

230
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,441
"The sky is your ground to play"

231
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,241
"A bird won't forget to fly half way"

232
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,566
Dance with me

233
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,400
How dare you!

234
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,402
Don't!

235
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,561
Move out of the way

236
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,205
It was most unexpected

237
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,243
He had the gall to
attack our Cheeni bro!

238
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,322
We must show him our power

239
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,083
I caught an Eel

240
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,649
Trying your tricks with me?

241
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,490
It isn't easy, you know

242
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,967
Only if the bait fish
is alive it is do-able

243
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,283
It will be very protective
towards its many young ones

244
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,366
VWII try to survive
till the very last second

245
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,650
Deli-cious!

246
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,041
To feast on such a tasty fish
we should know its innate nature

247
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,249
Only then it can be caught
And its flavor appreciated

248
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,851
Kabali is just like this fish

249
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,046
He is ready to be caught

250
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,645
But not right now

251
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,484
Tony Lee is out of the country

252
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,805
Just 1 sure shot

253
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,360
It should be a point
of no return for him

254
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,124
Not miss the bull's eye

255
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,601
Let us wait

256
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,050
Enjoy the fish gravy

257
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,246
- What is this?
- Mutton

258
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,049
- Enjoy
- Serve some more

259
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,686
Wow!

260
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,208
Fathima
Sooooper!

261
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,725
Finger-licking good!

262
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,211
Just like my wife's cooking

263
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,805
'Thanks a lot, anna'

264
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,843
Really?
You think it's so-

265
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,611
Tell me the truth, anna
I won't get angry

266
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,044
My wife's culinary skill
is truly awesome, right?

267
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,451
Listen, my dear

268
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,643
If I praise your cooking
your husband doesn't believe me

269
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,960
Look into it

270
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,051
How will taste buds talk
when he has no tongue!

271
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,691
I don't have atongue?!
Isn't this proof enough?

272
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,966
(dismissive laughter)

273
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,681
I'm enjoying ayummy dinner
after many years, let me eat in peace

274
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,841
Just kidding, anna

275
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,522
- Eat
- Don't want, ma

276
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,681
'Enjoy yourself, anna'

277
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,285
What do you want?

278
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,366
Don't cry

279
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,810
'Will you ignore
your poor pregnant wife?'

280
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,089
'- What do you want?
- I want to hug you tight and sleep'

281
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,842
'Come, why are you so late?'

282
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,729
'Everybody is waiting for you'

283
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,367
'Come inside.

284
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,481
'Good morning, sir'

285
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,761
'Come'

286
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,804
'I have discussed everything
No problem at all'

287
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,490
'You can go in'.

288
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,369
'My legs are all swollen'

289
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,170
'I can't even walk'

290
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,806
'Go...get me some water'

291
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,441
'Enough...enough'

292
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,926
'Let us eat'

293
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,849
'Everybody is waiting, right?'

294
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,005
'What are you doing?'

295
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,127
<i>'Come soon'</i>

296
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,846
'Where did you disappear?
We were starving'

297
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,247
'Come and eat with us'

298
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,209
'Come and eat, anna'

299
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,329
(nostalgic sigh)

300
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,367
Anna...?

301
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,249
Don't get stuck in the past now

302
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,129
We are all here for you

303
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,211
You can go now, Amir

304
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,240
Please go home, I want
to be alone for a while

305
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,441
Okay

306
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,690
'Your wife has also been
laid to rest here'

307
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,361
There were no family members
<i>So</i> the policemen went ahead with-

308
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,525
Hey Banu!
Good to see you

309
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,331
What brings you here?
Thought of me suddenly?

310
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,886
Think you're in your 20s?
I came to see uncle

311
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,928
Uncle, how are you?
You forgot me?

312
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,087
I'm Banu, uncle

313
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,088
You educated me in Klang
I stood first in the state

314
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,731
Oh! Is that you, Banu dear?

315
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,087
Are you married?
Where does your husband work?

316
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,764
All done and dusted!

317
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,485
What to do?

318
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,444
Don't yell at me
I was dealing in drugs

319
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,006
I was good at academics
I dreamt a lot

320
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,570
Didn't know whom to trust

321
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,091
He said he loved me

322
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,525
He said caste was no barrier

323
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,648
He quoted Mani Ratnam's films

324
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,210
And finally gave me a baby!

325
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,762
During land redistribution, he said
he was leaving for Tamil Nadu

326
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,171
I told him not to

327
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,968
That was the last I saw of him
I haven't set eyes on him again

328
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,485
What to do?

329
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,886
I have only 1 son

330
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,531
Jeeva, come here

331
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,124
I've wasted my life

332
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,124
He is refusing to study

333
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,168
If I get him a job
he beats up everyone

334
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,685
He saw you somewhere

335
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,047
He is so adamant
he wants to work for you

336
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,731
I know you will make
a man out of him

337
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,040
Take him, uncle

338
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,447
Why are you crying?
He is in safe hands

339
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,363
Go home, I'll keep you posted

340
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,566
Anna, you had sent for him

341
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,563
Banu's son Jeeva is here

342
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,407
Anna

343
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,607
Stop the car

344
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,250
Jaya, call that boy

345
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,524
Bro, come here

346
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,491
Get into the car

347
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,086
Hold...hold

348
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,167
Wait

349
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,647
Move

350
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,810
Hahn...Fathima!

351
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,770
Fathima handles everything here

352
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,047
- Welcome, anna
- Good...good...good

353
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,402
Move...move

354
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,927
70 Tamil students graduate
from our school every year

355
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,843
They are 16 to 20 years old

356
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,524
All are school dropouts

357
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,523
These kids were all in the gang

358
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,607
Please come

359
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,764
Come this way, anna

360
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,408
When our students were with
the gang, they used all this

361
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,528
<i>So</i> we have confiscated their stuff

362
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,204
Please come this way

363
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,129
We seized these accessories...

364
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,807
...reflecting the symbols
and colors of their gangs

365
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,609
We should be disciplined, right?

366
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,846
I appreciate it

367
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,286
Let's go

368
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,525
This way

369
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,651
All of you, relax

370
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,080
Please come

371
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,680
Get that chair

372
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,281
Please sit

373
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,522
Tiger

374
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,651
Do you know who this is?

375
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,006
- We do
- Mr Kabali

376
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,971
He donated this building for our school
He helps us to run it too

377
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,771
How about a special
'Free Life' salute for him?

378
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,169
Free Life salute

379
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,363
- What's up?
- Hey, wait

380
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,930
Why did VOL! get up?

381
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,531
Won't you sit in one place?

382
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,170
I am sitting quiet, right?

383
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,083
He's like that
Quite restless

384
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,003
He is hyperactive normally

385
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,764
- Ask him his name
- Why?

386
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,921
Just ask him

387
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,565
What is your name?

388
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,325
Hey! Get up

389
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,564
Tell him your name

390
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,689
Otherwise you know
the punishment?

391
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,411
Run around our ground
a whole day through

392
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,929
- Tiger...!
- Tiger...?

393
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,206
(indulgent chuckle)

394
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,289
Which gang are you from?

395
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,081
43."!

396
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,446
Do you know our anna?

397
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,488
- Heard he heads the 00 gang
- Shut up!

398
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,403
What will you do
after graduating?

399
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,045
Join the gang!

400
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,770
Would you like
to join anna's gang?

401
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,565
My team is the best

402
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,570
Smart Alec he is!

403
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,687
Idiot! Sit down

404
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,411
Meena, why did you smile at him?

405
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,885
I didn't smile at all

406
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,203
I was only watching Tiger

407
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,964
Didn't she flash her teeth?

408
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,321
Of course she did
She's lying now

409
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,806
No chance

410
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,042
I swearl didn't smile, akka

411
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,964
- Please believe me
- Hey! Meena

412
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,891
They lie to get me into trouble

413
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,603
Sir, you resemble my dad so much

414
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,891
'Dad, you be fair
Did I laugh?'

415
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,325
'I was just looking at Tiger-'

416
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,721
She must have had a puff or two

417
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,044
'Pa, tell them I didn't'

418
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,841
Tick them off
before you walk away

419
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,644
'That girl's name is Meena'

420
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,802
'She lives in my place
Sunway flats'

421
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,083
'In high school, she fell in love
with a pusher next door'

422
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,651
'He was older than her'

423
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,531
'Cheated this young girl
and made her pregnant'

424
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,322
'He ditched this girl
half way through'

425
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,607
'She became a mother
at a very young age'

426
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,004
'Claiming she wasn't fit to be a mother,
'Child care' authorities took her baby'

427
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,010
'She lost everything in life'

428
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,529
'It was Marthandam
who brought her to our school'

429
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,530
'Too depressed
she started taking drugs'

430
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,570
'She will do anything
if you promise her drugs'

431
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,642
That girl called me 'dad', right?

432
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,242
Poor thing!

433
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,168
If my child had lived, I would have
a daughter or son her age, huh?

434
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,325
We should be on our guard

435
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,247
Don't know what
will happen and when!

436
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,931
Situation then and today
aren't the same

437
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,011
43 gang is in a different level then

438
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,250
Even without Tony Lee,
Veerasekaran is ruling the roost

439
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,608
How can we think of taking Cheeni-

440
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,611
Amazing fish!

441
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,244
Well cooked, chef

442
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,486
Serve him

443
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,130
Eat well, Marthandam

444
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,889
- Seafood doesn't agree with me
- You'll be fine, enjoy

445
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,526
We are hounded by them

446
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,001
They wait to pounce
on us for commission

447
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,242
They control all the areas

448
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,687
Ampang, Bukit Bintang, Kajang

449
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,603
How can we do any
business then?

450
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,205
I'll handle it
No worries

451
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,040
Hey! I told them
we are gangsters too

452
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,810
But no one is respecting me

453
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,050
Like the comedian Vadivelu, go around
proclaiming 'I am also a rowdy'

454
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,925
Looks like I must adopt
only that kind of ploy!

455
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,765
If you ask me...

456
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,604
...people with talent
can live here

457
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,929
If we want to live
we should turn a blind eye

458
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,725
Money...power

459
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,643
If we need to bend a little...

460
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,290
...then why don't we?

461
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,566
But you know what?

462
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,641
Both 43 and our gang are one and the same
to the policeman's palm that is greased

463
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,803
They won't spare us
because we are in the right

464
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,484
Noticing our good deeds...

465
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,211
...people should respect us
Not be petrified

466
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,884
Wherever we go in this country...

467
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,770
...the locals and Chinese
aren't our enemies

468
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,841
Only Tamilians!!

469
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,764
If this is our plight
how will people trust us?

470
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,884
Our men also get
their hands dirty like gang 43

471
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,007
Why?

472
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,208
Aren't people here
peddling drugs?

473
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,566
Those are all rumors

474
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,440
I follow the same taboo on
hookers or drugs that anna did

475
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,570
When I am here,
will I let anyone else in?

476
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,211
In this gang then
are you the drug lord?

477
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,731
Mocking me?

478
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,610
Kabali'na, all I want is
for you to believe me

479
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,761
That's enough

480
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,928
I'll never disobey you

481
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,044
Eat well, Marthandam

482
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,605
Enjoy your dinner

483
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,042
Why did you stop?
Go on...eat

484
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,442
Is it enough?
Please sit

485
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,971
Please sit down!

486
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,444
Take care of your health

487
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,450
I'll take care

488
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,646
No problem

489
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,206
You take care of yourself

490
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,520
(tickled pink-laughter)

491
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,170
I always do

492
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,086
I'm glad we met

493
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,127
I'll take leave

494
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,046
Times are changing

495
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,690
Problems stay the same

496
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,886
But unity...?

497
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,809
It's like Marthandam!

498
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,922
When I look at the kids
in Free Life, my blood-

499
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,845
What are we doing?

500
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,206
What is our job?

501
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,728
Did we suffer
to end up like this?

502
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,371
Look at those kids

503
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,601
I know

504
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,523
My days are numbered

505
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,004
Before they take the lead
we have our hands full

506
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,402
We must put an end to the atrocities by
Tony Lee and his gang in this country today

507
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,687
Especially the injustice
to Tamilians

508
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,764
We must stop the power
they are in cahoots with

509
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,649
For all their bias...

510
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,121
...the time has come
to put a full stop

511
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,688
It is the beginning of his end

512
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,806
Cheers...!

513
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,724
Someone has snitched about us

514
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,007
- Definitely
- <i>So</i> evident when he talks

515
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,481
True, why would
Kabali anna talk like that?

516
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,049
<i>'Wm
“mvvemaw
mm.?</i>

517
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,725
'Just a piece of land I want'

518
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,610
'Goddess Shakthi
a mere piece of land'

519
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,848
Marthandam is peeing in his pants

520
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,526
Now we must break
the power of gang 43

521
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,762
You want, huh?

522
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,923
If we tap on drugs, it is
as good as hitting Tony Lee

523
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,008
Because your mother
deals with drugs?

524
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,721
'Nowadays people mint money
only in gambling and prostitution'

525
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,968
- Let's control it
- How can you say this?

526
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,930
For a 50 paise cola we buy
in the market for 2.5 ringgit

527
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,082
Manufacturing, advertising, paying tax

528
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,686
Different rates by
wholesaler and retailer

529
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,489
Extra price for theatre and mall

530
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,251
Price of drugs depends on
who the buyer is

531
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,924
1 ringgit can fetch 100 MYR

532
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,287
It changes hands
through a big chain link

533
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,522
'Hit the head,
entire network will collapse'

534
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,325
In 43, Loga is Tony Lee's drug lord

535
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,450
'Ship breaking yard
Port Klang is his drug factory'

536
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,568
'He employs youngsters,
mostly Tamilians'

537
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,165
<i>'School dropouts'</i>

538
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,967
'Entire Malaysia
is supplied by him'

539
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,247
'He is the supplier
to this school too'

540
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,921
'That boy Tiger...'

541
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,684
'...was a pusher in Loga's gang'

542
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,847
'Hey! Keep quiet'

543
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,928
Loga is next on my list

544
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,168
Schedule a meeting
with him immediately

545
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,487
No

546
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,091
Let's go directly

547
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,965
Stop the car

548
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,651
Please come

549
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,762
Hey...boys...boys

550
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,131
2 minutes

551
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,965
I need to talk to you

552
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,441
So...Loga
How is business?

553
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,562
What do you want?
Come to the point

554
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,641
Don't waste my time

555
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,642
<i>exam?</i>

556
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,563
Oh! Is that right?

557
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,565
What is your source?

558
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,721
Why?

559
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,571
Do you want some?

560
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,170
Potent to the core

561
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,447
No one can give you my quality

562
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,204
Your gang members...

563
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,203
...won't deal with drugs, right?

564
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,170
You're the good-deeds gang

565
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,207
What?

566
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,130
Are you pulling a fast one?

567
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,602
You can't deal with drugs hereafter
Put a full stop to everything

568
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,761
That's it

569
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,367
Impossible

570
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,646
Clear out now

571
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,924
Otherwise you'll be a corpse

572
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,206
Hey boys!

573
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,009
Ask this chap to clear out

574
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,764
He's simply playing the fool

575
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,246
Super...!

576
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,604
Oh! This is the 'point', huh?

577
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,124
This fellow is 'yours truly'

578
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,770
I look really young, right?

579
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,763
I don't have a copy of this

580
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,330
Let me take a snap

581
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,927
Let's get to the point

582
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,530
I was very young then

583
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,728
They needed a hand
I went, that's all

584
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,564
I didn't do anything there

585
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,766
Leave this place now

586
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,808
Hey! Escort him to his car

587
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,000
Listen

588
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,490
I'll tell you something

589
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,720
The chap who killed your wife
was that scumbag Velu!

590
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,689
Try to find him and
finish him off

591
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,285
Otherwise let me know

592
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,805
I'll slice him to pieces

593
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,724
He took away my drug supply

594
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,246
You know how much cash
he stole from me?

595
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,086
If your wife had survived
he would've sold her for a good rate!

596
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,089
He's very partial to women

597
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,641
He won't let go
of even the plain Janes

598
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,730
Then imagine...!

599
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,810
Cheers...!

600
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,881
(revving up the engine)

601
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,286
"Fire in all its fury
Try confronting me"

602
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,767
"if you do
we will char you"

603
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,366
"To thrash and trample"

604
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,046
"Even in your dreams is it possible?"

605
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,851
"if pushed around
will you bow down?"

606
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,321
"To bullying will you buckle?"

607
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,880
"Will you heed any hurdle?"

608
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,930
"Dawn's new identity
Our very own Kabali"

609
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,688
'One of the renowned industrialists
in Malaysia Loga alias Loganathan...'

610
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,843
'...was killed yesterday
in a police encounter'

611
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,405
'This has created afuror-'

612
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,370
They've locked
the entire drug supply

613
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,851
'Can't do anything now'

614
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,048
Nowadays there's no business

615
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,009
Very bad condition

616
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,565
'KABA Ll'

617
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,449
'I don't think we
can 'cook' now, Ia'

618
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,204
Unless we take him out

619
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,767
'Yes, our business
has come to a standstill'

620
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,330
'We got no other choice'

621
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,366
Yogi is the right person

622
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,165
No one will suspect her
She is adept at this

623
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,886
I'll ask her to come

624
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,489
Let's start with
an invocation to God

625
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,090
Our men are shell shocked

626
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,323
'Police force hasjoined Kabali
and is taking us for a ride'

627
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,207
Call her

628
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,482
(offering to Goddess Kali)

629
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,763
'Praise be to the one
who dwells and rules the graveyard'

630
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,686
Hello, Yogi

631
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,802
Govt has a plan

632
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,564
We can't do anything now

633
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,964
Totally unexpected move from
someone least suspicious is ideal

634
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,884
You are the right choice

635
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,170
Only you can pull it off

636
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,844
He will be with you

637
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,969
He'll get everything ready for you

638
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,207
Hey!

639
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,365
My face is right here!

640
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,767
Okay

641
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,446
Consider it done

642
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,364
Anna, guess what?

643
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,649
Veerasekaran has moved his pawn
with offerings to Kali yesterday

644
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,725
'If your wife had survived
he would've sold her for a good rate!'

645
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,208
Something has been nagging me

646
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,204
In case Kumudha...

647
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,604
...is alive

648
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,290
...where will she be?

649
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,409
How will she be?

650
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,366
In my head in circles
random thoughts run

651
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,411
I must meet Velu

652
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,409
'Got this photo
from police records'

653
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,606
'Watch out!'

654
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,600
In Batu caves...

655
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,047
...there's a Tamil restaurant

656
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,601
Called Mama Meru

657
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,648
If you go there
you can catch him

658
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,850
"This world is like a river flowing"

659
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,641
"Time is like the boat floating"

660
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,845
"Once colorful memories
now cherished souvenirs"

661
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,924
(recollections overlapping)

662
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:16,286
"When I am caressed by the wind
wonder what hue is painted in my mind"

663
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,609
- Where is Velu?
- He's inside

664
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,682
- Velum?
- What can I do for you'?

665
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,807
He isn't the one
we are looking for

666
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,120
Let's go

667
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,480
Are you brainless or what?

668
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,040
They both had too many problems

669
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,851
He asked for a share
Veerasekaran tried to kill him

670
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,450
He kidnaps women

671
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,847
And uploads
their videos online

672
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,491
And forces them
to become hookers

673
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,244
If Velu catches you, that's it

674
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,324
"My heartbeafs melody"

675
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,283
"She was my harmony"

676
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,889
"My beautiful Mrs"

677
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,966
"Wonder now where she is"

678
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,406
Tiger, 9°

679
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,327
speak UP

680
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,811
I don't know where he is

681
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,325
'But the chap in Ampang will know'

682
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,448
'He is the watchman there'

683
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,565
'He would know Velu's whereabouts'

684
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,484
'Come...park here'

685
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,771
Kabali anna

686
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,089
Please forgive me

687
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,124
I've reformed

688
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,481
Turned over a new leaf

689
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,087
Please let go of me
Don't hurt me

690
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,969
Please don't kill me

691
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,561
Where is Velu?

692
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,569
I really have no clue

693
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,887
I came here long ago

694
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,486
They said your wife was dead

695
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,040
'And took her to the mortuary'

696
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,522
'The worker over there rushed out'

697
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,001
'And shouted saying she was still alive'

698
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,128
'Velu and Logawent in'

699
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,568
'Don't know what happened after that'

700
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,522
Amir, stop the car

701
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,882
"In each and every direction"

702
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,924
"I saw your reflection"

703
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,841
"In dreams and memories of mine"

704
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,647
"She floats; in my heart and mind"

705
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:58,969
"Won't she now appear
for real here?"

706
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,366
<i>'Sit down'</i>

707
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,362
'Don't you know where I am?'

708
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,049
'How long should I wait?'

709
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,001
'You are really troubling
a pregnant woman way too much'

710
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,722
'Why is your collar so dirty?'

711
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,962
'What will people think if they see it?'

712
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,450
Nab him, don't let him go

713
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,562
Stan the car
Let's not do anything now

714
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,051
Fast
Move!

715
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,289
Hey! Let go
Who the hell are you?

716
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,486
Take it off

717
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,489
Kumara...?
What is this?

718
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,286
He is Tamilmaran's son

719
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,720
Kumaran

720
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,526
Why did you do this?

721
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,965
Can't you hear me?

722
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,764
Didn't you kill my father?

723
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,128
My family was ruined
because of you

724
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,123
- Hey Kumara
- I'll kill you for sure

725
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,804
Is he Tamilmaran's son?

726
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,203
Actually...he wanted a job

727
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,446
If you got to know-

728
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,409
You might feel bad
if I told you

729
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,250
He's a good fellow
but why-

730
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,565
Sorry, anna

731
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,530
But I wasn't aware
he would want to kill you

732
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,051
(skeptical chuckle)

733
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,886
Tamilmaran's son has
really grown up

734
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,491
He wanted to kill me
Right before my eyes-

735
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,726
I wonder what else is in store
to wrench my heart?

736
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,206
Whatever problems we dream about
we come out of it in a second

737
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,648
If my life had been the same
how good it would have been!

738
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,969
'Jeeva has gone to fetch him'

739
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,880
Hey Amir

740
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,202
Are you ready?
Shall we go?

741
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,280
Graduation function

742
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,080
One batch is completing
the course today

743
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,207
They are leaving

744
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,607
They want to talk to you
before they leave

745
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,205
How will I be of any help?

746
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,850
Come and ask them yourself

747
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,570
Please come, pa

748
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,441
Let's g0, Pa

749
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,726
Okay

750
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,286
Sit over here

751
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,810
Free Life salute

752
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,569
Greetings to everyone here

753
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:52,562
Mr Kabali will be sharing
his life's experience with us

754
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,529
First generation graduate

755
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,330
How did he become like this?

756
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,448
What lessons did life teach him?

757
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,726
And what did he lose?

758
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,290
He will share a slice of his life

759
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,129
You can ask him
any question you want

760
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,929
Is that okay, Pa?

761
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,283
But before that...er...uh-

762
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,768
An alumnus of our school
Sivanesan anna who is working now

763
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,922
- ...will share his experience
- Go and talk

764
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,889
He graduated last year

765
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,161
Hello, anna

766
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,088
A warm hello to all of you
I am Sivanesan

767
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,447
I am also like you
A school dropout

768
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,966
I handled drugs and guns
even as a teenager

769
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,281
My life changed after I came here

770
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,489
Fathima akka, Amir anna
Kumaran sir took good care of me

771
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,648
I work in a pet shop
I am very happy

772
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,603
You study well too
And be happy like me

773
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,966
Thank you for everything

774
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,962
See you

775
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,166
Anyone can ask
any question to dad

776
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,645
Go ahead

777
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,722
Why are you wearing coolers
and a coat all the time?

778
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,604
It's summer now, sir

779
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,886
(amused laughter)

780
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,201
What kind of question
is this, sit down!

781
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,322
Sir, which gang
do you belong to?

782
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,090
You were a big wig it seems

783
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,242
Hey! Is this very important now?

784
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,762
Let them ask whatever they want
I have no problem at all

785
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,171
Are you handy with a gun?

786
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,969
Sir, he has handled a gun

787
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,769
Yes, it was really cool

788
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,126
A chap in gang 0 gave me

789
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,487
Like a hero I went bang bang bang

790
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,210
It was simply smashing, sir

791
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,731
You're just a kiddo

792
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,808
And you fired a gun

793
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,606
Sir, which part of India are you from?

794
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,208
We are originally
from Dindivanam

795
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,004
We worked for many years
as slaves to landlords here

796
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,491
After that...

797
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:36,327
...after my father's time, I studied and
worked in estates owned by the British

798
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,523
Started slaving for this countr-

799
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,886
(self conscious laughter)

800
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,882
<i>So</i> well educated

801
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,849
Why did you become a gangster?

802
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,282
Hit him
Don't spare him

803
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,282
Do you think you are equal
to them, the Chinese, Kabali?

804
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,322
Of course

805
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,124
We are not equal
to the Chinese

806
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,489
Because my forefathers fell prey to
snake bites, wild beasts, land slides

807
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,721
...this land is fertile

808
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,484
We aren't inferior to the Chinese

809
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,289
We work 10 times harder

810
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,840
We are not demanding
more wages than them

811
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,446
All we want is equal wages

812
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,241
Even if you pay us 1 ringgit less
not one of us will step into your land

813
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,169
We are not slaves
We are employees

814
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,287
You are an employer!

815
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,124
You should treat everybody equally

816
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,201
That is your duty

817
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,247
Try to understand it

818
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,209
Otherwise you will face
the consequences

819
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,442
I am not threatening you
I am warning you!

820
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,171
If you think I'm threatening
I will...yes!

821
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,808
(loud cheering)

822
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,808
'That was when Mr Tamilnesan
heard about it and sent for me'

823
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,729
'Amir and I went to meet him'

824
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:26,087
'As soon as he saw me,
he shook hands and hugged me'

825
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,161
'He praised me sky high
to his friends'

826
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,006
You must come, Kabali

827
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,326
You should come

828
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,561
You too

829
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,564
Everyone should support each other

830
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,325
Was he so fearless, sir?

831
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,570
Fear...huh?!

832
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,371
Tamilnesan sir used to say

833
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,845
My beloved people!

834
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,445
What is Dharma?

835
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,081
Describe justice to me

836
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,482
What we need is Dharma
That is justice

837
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,887
We have to ask
what is rightfully ours

838
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,811
It is our duty
Our birthright

839
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,685
As soon as palm oil proved
more profitable than rubber...

840
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,689
...in 1 second
A single second

841
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,243
people's hard work was squeezed,
their blood, sweat and tears extracted

842
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,449
They have been trashed
on the streets as waste

843
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,725
What are we asking for our people
who are helpless and homeless?

844
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,922
Supposing someone slaps you real hard

845
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,884
You feel like asking why
Then why bottle it?

846
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,043
Cry, lament aloud, scream
in the middle of the road

847
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,565
Let the neighbors hear

848
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,290
But he will pretend he didn't

849
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,646
Shout till your throat is hoarse

850
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,290
Or die if need be

851
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,929
At one point he has to hear
and react to our cries

852
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,207
This protest is not for one man

853
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,247
Not for 1 family

854
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,291
It is a voice of dissent for people
belonging to an entire race

855
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,130
Kabali, you achieved the impossible
singlehanded in that small estate?

856
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,765
Does your world stop with that?

857
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,446
Come with me
to Kuala Lumpur town

858
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,523
There are 10,000 heart broken people

859
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,365
Support the oppressed
Lend a hand, revolt

860
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,011
I want Kabali

861
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,523
(thrilled laughter)

862
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,406
Aiyo! Baby

863
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,288
Sorry...sorry

864
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,011
Guess what? I met my leader
Tamilnesan sir today

865
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,366
Wowwww!

866
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,280
'I was talking to my wife
the whole night about my idol'

867
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,886
Are you very fond of your wife?

868
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,922
Yes

869
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,922
This much!

870
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,326
Love, huh?

871
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,563
You'll be on dot
about all this!

872
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,801
(bashful chuckle)

873
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,166
Let me tell you

874
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,366
Can I, anna?

875
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,761
Love marriage

876
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,207
Not the ordinary love
you and I go through

877
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,406
Soooooper love!

878
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,720
(sheepish laughter)

879
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,604
Made for each other

880
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,205
Her family did not agree

881
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,682
Indians wherever they go,
whatever they take or not...

882
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,286
...they will latch on to
caste, religion, status!

883
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,407
That's the problem

884
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,405
But our sister-in-law dumped everything
and came with full faith in anna

885
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,006
Then what?
I got them married

886
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,161
(appreciative laughter)

887
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,050
Yes, only this VIP
presided over our wedding

888
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,611
She left all her belongings
and bond behind

889
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,801
How does she look?
Is she beautiful?

890
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,211
What is her name?

891
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,370
Her name is Kumudhavalli

892
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,204
Isn't it a beautiful name?

893
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,170
Just like her name
she is really beautiful

894
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,606
'When she laughs,
her whole face lights up'

895
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,166
Poetry, bro

896
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,720
He has also written
a beautiful poem, bro

897
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,928
- Poetry?
- About laughter

898
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,570
Get up and recite

899
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,120
'I drown in your laughter'

900
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,727
'When I gasp for breath
I will ask for more'

901
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,205
'Save some for me for an encore'

902
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,367
superb!

903
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,847
This applies to Kumudhavalli also

904
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,763
That's it, I fell for
that tinkle of laughter

905
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,208
<i>So</i> beautiful, huh?
Then how did she fall for you?

906
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,930
Mocking me, huh?

907
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,890
Power of my dark complexion
She fell for me at once

908
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,764
She fell for you!

909
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,564
You expect us to believe this?

910
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,324
Sarcasm?!

911
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,170
This is what everyone asked

912
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,969
I asked her too

913
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,486
'This was what she said'

914
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,767
I looked into your eyes
for just 2 minutes

915
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,285
I fell for you, head to toe

916
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,931
I want to be floating
in that spell bound feeling

917
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,084
Even after I breathe my last

918
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,927
I want your dark skin tone
smeared all over my body

919
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,964
I love you that much!

920
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,526
(relishing laughter)

921
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,810
Today, if I realize my worth
so powerfully...

922
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,290
...she is the reason

923
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,282
She will be forever
motivating me

924
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,728
Even in the smallest issue

925
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,007
He hit you, right?
You should retaliate

926
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,320
Don't get confused

927
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,562
Don't think or plan
when you are angry

928
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,687
Breathe!

929
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,207
Go

930
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,369
Even those who are up to no good
are so goddamn gutsy

931
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,245
You are doing a good deed
Go for it bravely

932
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,600
Understand?

933
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,765
'She is my spine'

934
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,850
I was so depressed
after Mr Tamilnesan was killed

935
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,606
She revived me

936
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,966
'What do you mean, sir?'

937
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,128
'Who killed such a big shot?'

938
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,641
Only a Tamilian

939
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,366
Who else?!

940
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,402
Do you know
this story of the crab?

941
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,448
It is a fable
all of us know in Malaysia

942
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,969
If you stuff crabs into a pot...

943
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,045
...they will try to come out

944
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,526
The crab at the back
struggling to come out...

945
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,007
...will pull down
the crab in front

946
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,481
It will send that crab
back into the pot

947
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,642
Taking turns pulling and pushing...

948
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,722
...no crab will come out it seems

949
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,649
Same story applies to our people

950
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,281
Dog in the manger
Won't let us progress

951
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,803
The crab in this fable
is Veerasekaran

952
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,850
'Sir was very strict'

953
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,967
'Foremost condition in the gang is
not to indulge in flesh trade'

954
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,281
'No drugs or alcohol at all'

955
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,127
'That was when drugs entered the nation'

956
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,925
'The Chinese wanted to
get rich in this way'

957
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,207
'Tamilnesan sir opposed it strongly'

958
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,043
Even if we lose everything we have...

959
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,447
...we shouldn't let drugs
gain afoothold into our gang

960
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,482
Okay

961
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,641
Gawd! Come here

962
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,450
Sir...sir!

963
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,685
SIR!

964
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,206
<i>Kw“!</i>

965
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,123
'Some wretched fellow
has killed him'

966
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,725
What the-l

967
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,369
The Chinese killed him using the Tamilian
whose cause he was fighting!

968
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,726
For mere money!

969
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,086
I decided only then

970
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,640
After Tamilnesan

971
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,200
Now Veerawill take over

972
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,807
- They are demolishing our temple
- Be calm

973
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,360
- We're going to demolish this temple
- You have permission?

974
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,930
You don't create
any problem here

975
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:31,887
Get lost!

976
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,527
To demolish that temple
you have to finish me off first

977
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,687
Tamilnesan sir
is alive in you!

978
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,125
Don't put me on a pedestal

979
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,322
I'll handle it
You leave now

980
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,608
"Herald of the braves
Savior of the slaves"

981
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,963
"Bravest of the braves
Shielder of the slaves"

982
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,170
"This new-age Warrior's power
The world is clueless altogether"

983
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,323
Some stranger from nowhere
They hail him as the next Tamilnesan

984
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,243
It should be either you or me

985
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,971
"When the good hearted wept
When slaves claimed respect"

986
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,605
"You elevated them from neglect"

987
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,682
You visit places
You meet people

988
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,689
Your dress speaks for you

989
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,842
(carefree laughter)

990
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,445
Who decides a style?

991
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,724
They should be the only ones
to wear a suit

992
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:22,842
We will change it

993
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,802
"Kabali coming"

994
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,882
"Can you feel the ground shake
Like an earthquake"

995
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,768
"Nowhere to run"

996
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,080
"It's too late
Real gangstaz"

997
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,606
"From the city to the estate
Real gangstaz"

998
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,045
"Separate good from the great"

999
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,565
"Keeping it straight 0G"

1000
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,688
"Since the 80's untouchable"

1001
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,926
"A.K.A Kabali".

1002
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,367
"Fighting for what's right
Standing up for the weak"

1003
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,886
"Looking fly kicking ass
In a suit and hockey stick"

1004
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,407
"Dum dum dum...enmity explosion"

1005
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,881
"Lion in the arena, den is forsaken"

1006
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,247
"Guardian angel with you
Walking all the way through"

1007
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,806
"From pain flutters duly
Liberty's flag carefree"

1008
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,962
"Your force makes foes flee"

1009
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,247
"Land may alter
V\fill your words ever falter?"

1010
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,721
"Can mountain peaks tall
tower over you at all?"

1011
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:03,164
"Our leader defender
V\fill justice sleep hereafter?"

1012
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:13,208
"Galahad, the gallant knight
Our ruler with wisdom and might"

1013
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,808
"Lend me your ears
I'll slice 'em all off"

1014
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,241
"With the same pair of scissors
My mama uses to cut cloth"

1015
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,482
"Every man gotta right
to decide his destiny"

1016
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,001
"I'd rather die standing up
than living life on my knees"

1017
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,560
"Beat the war drums hard
Don't let the music stop!"

1018
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,722
"Magizhchi muthalvaz
Coz this jam rocks!"

1019
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,320
"Beat the war drums hard
Don't let the music stop!"

1020
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,767
"Magizhchi muthalvaz
Coz this jam rocks!"

1021
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,127
"Lute of rights he played
He honed his sword-"

1022
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,403
You substituted oil palm for rubber
for your gain, satisfaction and power

1023
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,443
"His true self to the world he displayed"

1024
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,524
"0' valiant one
Our hearts he won"

1025
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,085
We will revolt
What's wrong?

1026
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,527
"Breaking barriers aside
Holding heads high in pride"

1027
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,807
"The rearguard as warlord qualified"

1028
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,562
"Courageous warrior
Our eternal ruler"

1029
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,491
Now you know why

1030
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,923
This dressing style

1031
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:05,369
Otherwise in this heat
why would I be dressed like this?

1032
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,169
This is just cloth, I agree

1033
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,129
For being dressed like this

1034
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,166
For people hailing me
as the next Tamilnesan

1035
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,767
For Tony Lee and Veerasekaran
using my friend Tamilmaran...

1036
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,649
...to destroy my family and me-

1037
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,281
<i>' Aug Lee'</i>

1038
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,001
'Most respected don'

1039
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,851
'A very good man
amongst the Chinese'

1040
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,921
'He hosted a dinner
for all the gangs'

1041
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,650
'We attended the feast too'

1042
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,246
'Tony Lee and his gang were also present'

1043
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,363
I am so happy

1044
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,167
All of you gathered here tonight

1045
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:55,004
This meeting is purely to
strengthen our friendship

1046
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:00,810
Let us forget all the problems
and stay connected always

1047
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,964
We should be proud that
at this very young age...

1048
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:08,563
...Kabali has been chosen
to be the people's leader

1049
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:14,124
He will fulfill Tamilnesan's place
in everybody's heart

1050
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,726
Kabalimbottoms up!

1051
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,724
In all fairness...

1052
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,689
...you should have got
the laurels he is receiving now

1053
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,927
You should have succeeded Tamilnesan

1054
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,361
Isn't that usual gang culture?

1055
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,044
You'll get angry if I say this

1056
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,441
Tony Lee is taking over
from Ang Lee

1057
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,040
Even I wanted to
take Tamilnesan's place

1058
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,730
Did they let me?

1059
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,685
You are a good man

1060
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,205
You give up everything

1061
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,890
Drink...enjoy

1062
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,851
Hello, partner

1063
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,001
Excuse me

1064
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,567
You spend all your money
on your clothes, huh?

1065
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,880
Of course, Mara

1066
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,083
If we don't dress well, who will?

1067
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,322
You don't listen to me
when I tell you to

1068
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,641
This is also a symbol of protest

1069
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,730
If Gandhi went shirtless
and Ambedkar wore a coat...

1070
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,325
...they had their own agenda

1071
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,362
Politics!

1072
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,487
I'll tell you later

1073
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,125
Go slow on your drinks

1074
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,087
Control yourself

1075
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,201
Amir, come

1076
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,806
But you really look super smart!

1077
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,922
Hello, gentlemen

1078
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,881
Escort him

1079
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,889
Come inside
We can drink there

1080
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,165
Our bro is here

1081
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,887
Bro, we want to meet Kabali anna

1082
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:48,922
Why?

1083
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,488
We can tell only him

1084
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,850
First tell me
Only then you can meet him

1085
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,689
We are coming from Penang estate

1086
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,081
We can tell only him
about our problem

1087
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,441
Kabali anna is here
Let's meet him

1088
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,204
Add some ice cubes

1089
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,847
Do it

1090
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,285
Hey! Tamilmaran

1091
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,407
Ice cube, huh?

1092
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,324
I am Tamilnesan's son

1093
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,330
Listen to me

1094
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,891
You're picking a bottle

1095
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,525
Are you planning to kill him?

1096
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,570
Please disperse

1097
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,329
<i>50"'!</i>

1098
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,966
Will everyone ask
only for you, huh'?

1099
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,568
Don't forget your humble beginnings

1100
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,446
You shouldn't have been
allowed into my house

1101
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,965
Tamilnesan is my father

1102
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,884
I should take his place
How dare you usurp it?

1103
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,201
Listen! Hereafter
what I say goes

1104
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,371
You must address
your problems to me

1105
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,562
You humiliated me
in front of everyone

1106
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,607
- Nothing...nothing
- I am disassociating myself from you

1107
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,522
Okay

1108
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,251
Tamilmaran anna
Listen to me, wait

1109
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,722
- Listen to me, wait
- Move aside

1110
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,726
Look who is here

1111
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,409
Hey! What a surprise
Come, my friend

1112
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,766
I was thinking about you

1113
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,722
Sorry, anna

1114
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,768
He drank too much
and spoke out of turn

1115
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,889
Don't hold it against him
He didn't sleep last night

1116
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,486
I thought he may feel better
if he meets you

1117
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,648
Good thinking
Sit down

1118
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,207
'Eat, bro'

1119
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,444
Be on your guard, friend

1120
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,010
Enemies have increased

1121
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,485
Eat...please eat

1122
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,047
All said and done, I shouldn't
have behaved like that

1123
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,730
In front of so many people...

1124
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,047
...I fought, brought the roof down

1125
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,441
I was so upset

1126
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,244
Stop obsessing about it

1127
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,721
I'm not being myself at all

1128
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,046
That's why-

1129
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:02,443
If I visit Maduraiveeran temple
things will get ironed out it seems

1130
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,881
Plan to go with my family
You come along

1131
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,643
I'll join you
You come too, dear

1132
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,247
<i>'Prime he m Goddess Shawn?</i>

1133
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,887

1137
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,010
Stop the music

1138
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,645
Hold the sword

1139
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,121
Hold it

1140
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:41,891
Kabali...!

1141
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,371
You will rule this country, okay?

1142
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,244
You'll govern this nation

1143
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,561
Till your wife is with you...

1144
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,888
...no one can harm you in anyway

1145
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,567
You don't need
companions or friends

1146
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,050
You will lead a good life

1147
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,169
(Uproar)

1148
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,281
Oh my dear!

1149
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,965
Watch out!

1150
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,611
Hey Kumara!

1151
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,042
Come away from here

1152
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,245
Hey! Kabali...!

1153
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,685
Drop the knife

1154
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,964
Bloody tramp of a mongrel!

1155
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,485
Look at your dress?

1156
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,006
You won't take off your coat
even in a temple festival?

1157
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,521
Were you born with that coat?

1158
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,531
Take off your damn coat

1159
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,085
Don't

1160
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,965
You and your damn coolers!

1161
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,608
- Remove his coat
- Don't let them

1162
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,284
Don't let them take it off

1163
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,086
Kumudhaaaa!

1164
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,885
My dearest"!

1165
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,042
I'm the next Tamilnesan!

1166
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,361
Die now

1167
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,362
Police...police

1168
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,487
Letjiés go

1169
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,362
Shameless!
You too?

1170
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,641
Police arrested our anna

1171
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,249
They claimed he had influenced
the Tamils against the state

1172
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:30,001
Because he questioned the demolition
of the temple and demanded land

1173
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,526
Assembled the Tamilians and revolted

1174
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,967
Their anger mounted
due to all these reasons

1175
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,242
They ensured he would
be put away forever

1176
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,561
They framed a case
and sentenced him

1177
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,329
- Where are you going?
- I'll wait outside

1178
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,765
He is well educated

1179
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:47,682
To serve the people
he joined the gang

1180
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,161
But...

1181
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,124
...his situation today

1182
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,202
Instead of studying at this age...

1183
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,886
...resorting to guns and drugs

1184
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:05,409
At least when you graduate
take the right decision

1185
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,170
Each bird...

1186
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,010
...carries a seed

1187
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,361
In every seed there is aforest

1188
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:14,569
We believe that quality
is embedded in you too

1189
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,483
You share the same belief please

1190
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:17,682
All the best!

1191
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,285
Cheers...!

1192
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,329
Sir, I'll come with you

1193
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,771
Let us shoot them all down

1194
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,410
Accept me in your gang

1195
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:43,761
I'll do it for you, sir

1196
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,729
No one should be spared

1197
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,886
Wear your coat even when you sleep!
I'll handle them, huh?

1198
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,930
How are you?

1199
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,168
- Fine?
- I'm okay

1200
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:01,481
I never even dreamt
he would think this way

1201
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,562
- Please forgive him
- It's okay

1202
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,523
Of course he's bound to be angry

1203
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,883
Even if he was in the wrong,
he was your friend

1204
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,240
How the hell could you-

1205
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,321
Jeeva!
Respect

1206
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,410
How could you kill him?

1207
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,126
Even my mother defends you

1208
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,730
But how can I-

1209
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,407
<i>'NM you keep gum';?</i>

1210
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,965
Right before my eyes...

1211
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,969
...you killed my father!

1212
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,531
I saw him

1213
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,324
Collapsing to the ground

1214
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,930
Son, I'm sorry

1215
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,122
I'll assume this to be
an apology to your father

1216
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,684
'Why did you behave like this?'

1217
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,285
Daaaaad...!

1218
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,129
Why did you let go
of your Kumudha?

1219
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,247
What's wrong with you?

1220
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,810
- Amir!
- Let go of me

1221
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,405
- Get lost!
- Hey Jeeva

1222
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,130
You call yourself a rowdy

1223
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,726
But you let a pregnant woman die

1224
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,371
Poor woman!
She was pregnant

1225
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,570
Why didn't you save her?

1226
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:22,801
Why-n

1227
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,929
Get lost...lunatic!

1228
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:25,922
Useless!

1229
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,207
Let go of me

1230
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,611
Move...go...go

1231
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,651
'But you let a pregnant woman die'

1232
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,246
'Poor woman!
She was pregnant'

1233
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,611
I know where Velu is

1234
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,722
In Thailand
I'll show you

1235
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,726
'Velu brainwashed my father'

1236
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,280
'He instigated my father
to shoot you'

1237
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,044
'He is the cause of all problems'

1238
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,690
'We shouldn't spare him'

1239
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,447
Amir...?

1240
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,961
Tell me, anna

1241
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,363
I want to adopt Meena

1242
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,686
Amazing, anna

1243
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,286
We will do it
in a grand way

1244
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,846
That girl is also an orphan

1245
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,331
It will be good for both of you

1246
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:32,889
When I see that girl, I have some
kind of unexplained affinity

1247
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,801
Maybe...

1248
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,731
...that girl was my-

1249
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,165
(embarrassed chuckle)

1250
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,691
I have weird thoughts
swirling in my head!

1251
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,768
Amir'na, go past that store

1252
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,250
That way

1253
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,446
Hi handsome

1254
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,250
He'll be up there

1255
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,450
Hey! Where are you going?

1256
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,565
He is here

1257
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,361
You are the reason
for my father's death

1258
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,923
'I will kill you'

1259
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,883
It wasn't my fault

1260
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,486
I am now-

1261
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:07,929
I am now reaping
for my sins, Kabali

1262
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,969
What did you do
to my Kumudha?

1263
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,407
I didn't...l didn't do anything

1264
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:38,170
I swear I don't know
what happened to your wife

1265
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,891
Your daughter is alive

1266
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,405
What did you say?

1267
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,170
Hey Velu...hey...!

1268
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:15,760
Look at that!

1269
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,441
<i>Hey Chem</i>

1270
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,210
This isn't good for you

1271
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,566
Hey! Just shut up!

1272
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,364
VWII you die now?

1273
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,007
APPaaaaaa!

1274
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,688
Dad...watch out

1275
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,967
Let's get out of here, pa

1276
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,850
Dad, come with me

1277
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:13,891
Move...move

1278
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,123
- Let's go
- Jeeva, take care

1279
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,446
Come inside

1280
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,326
Stan the car

1281
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,445
Pa...

1282
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,321

1285
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:20,926
Only now...

1286
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,561
...I know why I am alive

1287
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,846
Stop the car

1288
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,007
Why, pa?

1289
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,288
Why is Meena standing here?

1290
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,767
- Who is that girl?
- She is from Free Life

1291
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,089
(whimpering)

1292
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,442
- Why are you here?
- Don't come, pa

1293
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,488
- Go away
- Why are you crying?

1294
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,486
Appa

1295
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,280

Don't let them go scot free

1299

Come fast

1300
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,207
Welcome Tony, welcome

Good to see you!

'Kabali who was released after 25 years
from Malacca prison last month...'

1303
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:04,367
- '...was shot by unknown assassins'
- Is he back? Really?

1304
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:08,729
'Popular with both Malaysian and Tamils
Kabali, the leader of 00 gang...'

1305
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:12,526
'...when he was returning from Thailand,
was shot on Persiaran KLCC road'

1306
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,211
Marthandam told me to do this

1307
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,045
Otherwise he threatened
to kill my child

1308
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,930
He made me wait enroute
when Kabali'pawas going home

1309
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,008
- And shot him
- Stop crying

1310
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:37,606
Bro, look at him

1311
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,842
His parents and sister

1312
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,570
I can't...bear it

1313
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,521
Bro, somehow
take revenge

1314
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,209
Only I could do it

1315
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:10,765
5 bullets pierced him

1316
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,730
He didn't die that easily

1317
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,089
He is certainly the God of death!

1318
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,690
I already asked the police

1319
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:18,842
They confirm that he's dead

1320
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,525
No body found!

1321
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:21,761
Corpse not found

1322
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,491
Even after so many days,
no news in the papers

1323
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,091
I am really bugged

1324
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:29,289
Only after I cremate his body
I will rest in peace!

1325
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,089
This reporter has
to be killed

1326
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,400
'You know how media is!'

1327
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,686
Calm down

1328
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:35,366
Calm down

1329
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,964

1331
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,965

Nobody can f*** with us!

1333
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,841
Nobody

01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:55,970
(phone ringing)

1335
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,290
Why is Yogi calling now?

1336
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,409
'Welcome back Mr Tony Lee'

1337
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:15,045
(renewed laughter)

1338
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,043
I'm really happy

1339
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,481

01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,404
(sarcastic laughter)

1341
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,288
Horrrrible fellow, this Kabali!

1342
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,170
My daughter is with me today

1343
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,481
We will meet soon

"Like fire blazing fiercely"

1345
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,720
'Definitely'

Something

1354
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:59,931
Tell me he's dead

1355
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,161
That's enough

1356
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,208
Finish him off
when he's still hiding

1357
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,884
Don't know what I'll do

1358
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,485
They won't spare me

01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:08,847

at me in dazed wonder?

1364
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,848
Pa, please tell me

1365
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,041
Weren't you aware
of all this earlier?

1366
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:50,766
Yes, pa

1367
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,371
Not too long ago

1368
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:53,766
Only recently

1369
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:58,489
When I was assigned
the contract to k-kill you...

1370
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,324
'...that's when Velu'pa told me'

1371
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,169
'You are my biological father'

1372
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,884
They assigned me
to kill my own dad!

1373
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,010
I also took the gun

1374
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,571
And stalked you

1375
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,125
Just to protect you!

1376
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,287
'I desperately
tried to talk to you'

1377
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,127
'But-'

1378
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,444
Yogi has admitted Velu
in this hospital

1379
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:46,329
Why did you do this?

1380
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:52,084
In the police van dead bodies
were brought to the hospital

1381
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,210
'We had gone thereto claim
our gangster Murugan's body'

1382
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,966
'At that time I saw
Kabali's wife's lifeless body'

1383
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,602
'Few minutes after she was taken to
the mortuary, aworker yelled out'

1384
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:04,523
Bro, that girl is alive

1385
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,842
Let's go check...quick

1386
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,171
Take a look

1387
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,051
'Kabali's wife was fighting for her life'

1388
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,327
Hey! Come...come

1389
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,360
'I went and brought
a Malay midwife'

1390
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,330
'She delivered her baby'

1391
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,682
'A beautiful girl baby was born'

1392
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,001
'I didn't have anyone in my life'

1393
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,401
'Thinking I could adopt her as my own'

1394
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:30,371
'I brought up Kabali's daughter as my own'

1395
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,568
'Because of the problems
I had with Loga...'

1396
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,688
'...I came and settled in Thailand'

1397
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,925
'Only after she arrived...'

1398
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,361
'...my life changed for the better'

1399
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:42,684
'But that happiness
was short lived too'

1400
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,202
'Some drug pusher stabbed me'

1401
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:53,806
'From then on my whole world
revolved around my daughter'

1402
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:00,360
'She hunted down people
responsible for my plight'

1403
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,204
'And shot them all dead'

1404
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:09,289
'And then she became a mercenary
to keep the money flowing in'

1405
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,285
'Until today...'

1406
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:19,365
'...my daughter Yogi even after
reuniting with Kabali'

1407
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,887
'...takes care of me
like her own father'

1408
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,044
Where is Kabali's wife?

1409
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:29,486
Right there...

1410
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,971
...she passed away

1411
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,610
She died

1412
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,171
My mother isn't dead, pa

1413
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,650
She is alive

1414
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:49,247
Velu'pa told me about Hassima grandma
who took care of her delivery

1415
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,721
'When I was following you...'

1416
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:55,209
'...I was also looking for
Hassima grandma who knew my mother'

1417
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:59,086
'I spoke to the hospital staff
who took care of her'

1418
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,731
'And finally traced Hassima grandma'

1419
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:05,367
'She told me about the doctor
who treated mother'

1420
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:10,651
Then admitted her for a few months
in a mental health institution

1421
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,888
Valli...we knew nothing about her

1422
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,803
Who, what or why?

1423
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:18,561
'She got her memory back gradually
due to her head injury'

1424
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:22,167
'All of a sudden, she'll start crying
thinking of her husband and child'

1425
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:24,447
'I want to see my baby'

1426
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,210
'After she got a little better...'

1427
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,044
'...I took her to my house'

1428
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,531
'She'll keep working'

1429
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,761
'And suddenly freeze'

1430
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,604
'Tears will well up
and she will cry'

1431
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:35,524
'Hoping her husband will come for her'

1432
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:37,210
'She will wait at the porch'

1433
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:40,090
'Knowing she is expecting
the impossible...'

1434
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:42,447
'...I would feel very sorry for her'

1435
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:45,643
Then my cousin was also expecting a baby

1436
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,330
She needed a companion

1437
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:48,447
In Chennai

1438
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,403
I sent her to Tamil Nadu

1439
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,005
At least a change of place...

1440
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,650
...would make her feel better

1441
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:18,561
Pa...

1442
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,527
Anna

1443
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,005
Are you okay?

1444
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,282
Why are you crying, Pa?

1445
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,888
<i>AWE“?</i>

1446
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:31,881
Dad

1447
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,210
Get ready, dear
Right now

1448
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,527
Let's fetch your mother right away

1449
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,125
Amir, did you hear that?

1450
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,202
My Kumudha is still waiting for me

1451
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,009
But I thought she was dead

1452
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,128
God has willed it so

1453
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,126
- Hey Jeeva
- Anna?

1454
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,282
- I'll bring back my wife
- Okay, anna

1455
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:51,486
Bring her right now

1456
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:54,609
Tell Tony Lee and Veerasekaran
in the loudest voice possible

1457
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:57,160
'You can't do anything to us'

1458
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:00,528
Mallika, time has come
for our pain to be relieved

1459
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,290
Fortune favors us now

1460
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,131
Get ready now
Why are you dillydallying?

1461
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,326
How will we go now?

1462
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,526
By flight of course

1463
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,601
Hight?

1464
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,330
- Don't you know to fly?
- No, I don't

1465
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:11,885
(playful laughter)

1466
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:13,121
What is this, dear?

1467
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,481
Kabali's daughter
doesn't know to fly!

1468
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,403
Hey! Get ready

1469
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:20,723
My daughter and I are leaving
for Tamil Nadu to see my wife

1470
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,087
Get the passport
and tickets ready

1471
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:24,400
Come on

1472
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,520
Have a safe journey

1473
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:11,210
Love, huh?

1474
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:14,447
Take care

1475
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,130
Have a safe flight

1476
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:51,691
My grandfather left India long ago

1477
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,565
In that lineage,
I am the only one returning

1478
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,645
Just me

1479
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,569
Things are going as per plan

1480
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:00,721
Shouldn't miss

1481
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,251
We'll get them, okay?

1482
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,362
- Bro...?
- Is this you?

1483
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,283
- Yogi
- I'll talk to you later

1484
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,402
Did Amir send you?

1485
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,130
That's why I'm holding this

1486
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:11,770
So...are you yogi?

1487
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:14,726
Come here

1488
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:17,041
My name is Jai

1489
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,360
You know Amir, right?

1490
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,647
He spoke to my boss
and sent us here

1491
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,165
My boss is Anbu'na

1492
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:24,601
He had some work
<i>So</i> he couldn't come

1493
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,682
Don't worry
I'll take care of you

1494
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,603
Won't let down surely
those who trust in me!

1495
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:29,846
I am a Madrasi, sir

1496
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,046
Follow me

1497
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,281
Hold it

1498
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,010
Hey! Get the vehicle

1499
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,566
Come fast

1500
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,171
Come, sir

1501
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,365
Sir, you must be hungry

1502
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:47,289
- Shall we stop to eat?
- No need

1503
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,811
Go straight to the hotel

1504
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,803
You heard her
Drive straight to the hotel

1505
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,085
Daya, call the manager

1506
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,361
Hurry LIP

1507
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,606
Please come, sir

1508
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,570
- Welcome to Chennai
- Thank you

1509
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,130
It's a pleasure to have you here, sir

1510
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:20,202
- Please this way, sir
- Give it to me, sir

1511
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:39,721
Do you need anything else?

1512
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,968
- What happened, dear?
- No worries, pa

1513
01:31:58,040 --> 01:31:59,485
Just like that

1514
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:01,769
Dad, I'll get it

1515
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,164
(doorbell rings)

1516
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:14,006
This is my brother's card
My number is at the back

1517
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:16,208
If you need any help,
call me any time

1518
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:19,449
If someone knocks on the door,
check before you open

1519
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,567
<i>exam?</i>

1520
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,842
Our men are here
Don't be scared

1521
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:23,967
100% safe

1522
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,651
Adjacent room is ours
Shall I take leave?

1523
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:28,807
<i>'Tell me, bro'</i>

1524
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,087
'Room 806'

1525
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:32,208
'Father and daughter
just the 2 of them'

1526
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:33,731
'Consider it done'

1527
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:34,926
'Okay, bro'

1528
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,561
Kabali

1529
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,610
Can a single man...

1530
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:43,842
...eliminate the whole empire?

1531
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,241
No

1532
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,648
Because I'm fming here

1533
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,603
We will take control of everything

1534
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,330
Anyone who disagrees...?

1535
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,687
Well, they will disappear

1536
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,442
And we will march ahead!

1537
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,125
Enjoy your soup

1538
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,004
Taste our delicious soup

1539
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:04,605
Kabali is around

1540
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,449
Is it possible?

1541
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,409
He can't even sneak in

1542
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,403
You guys must do that first

1543
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:15,802
Then we can talk about
doing business in peace

1544
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,161
Sorry, Tony
I need to go

1545
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,808
Let us leave

1546
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,682
He seems a good chap to me

1547
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:41,331
“My jump to conclusions
looking at his face?

1548
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:46,004
But why are you so jumpy?
Very unusual of you

1549
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:48,122
First don't show them
you are scared

1550
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:51,249
We will be easy prey
if they know about our fear

1551
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:53,767
What, dad?

1552
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,729
How could you think
I'll be scared?

1553
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,887
Fean"?

1554
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,490
Me, Yogi...scared?

1555
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,364
Selling salt to the sea, huh?

1556
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,002
(scornful laughter)

1557
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,170
(doorbell ringing)

1558
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,165
(door bell, continues to ring)

1559
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:15,890
Wait, dear
I'll come

1560
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:17,405
Pa, don't know who it is

1561
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:18,447
Four-

1562
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,488
- There are 4 men
- Wait...wait

1563
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:24,606
Hello, sir

1564
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,051
I'm Anbu

1565
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:29,403
- Amir sent me
- Anbu, come on in

1566
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:31,244
Amir has briefed me

1567
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:32,446
No problem at all

1568
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,249
We can take care

1569
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,924
- Please sit
- Thank you

1570
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:39,089
Is everything okay?

1571
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,128
Everything is fine, thank you

1572
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:43,208
Only thing is, your hand
got stuck on the bell

1573
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:45,169
- Turned out to be a joke
- Sorry, sir

1574
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:46,685
Only because you didn't open

1575
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,001
Let's check that address, sir

1576
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,370
I listened to your story

1577
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:54,530
If I was piss drunk
I would have certainly cried

1578
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,405
Shall we have a drink, sir?

1579
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:57,641
It can be served downstairs

1580
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:00,121
- All under our control
- I don't drink

1581
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:02,288
Such a big shot
and you don't drink?

1582
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,931
You are pulling afast one, sir

1583
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,725
In Malaysia 'sarakku' means hooker!

1584
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,847
It means alcohol here, my dear

1585
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,843
Whiskey
Brandy

1586
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,325
Sir, this is the address

1587
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,288
Check this address

1588
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:20,925
Chettiar bungalow, MRC Nagar

1589
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,126
Ambedkar memorial

1590
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:23,440
Chettiar bungalow?

1591
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,371
We'll take care of it

1592
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,010
Get that gun

1593
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,046
Keep this with you
Not a problem

1594
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:34,088
I'm leaving 2 of my men here

1595
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,207
They'll take care

1596
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,281
Cheers...!

1597
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,328
Sir, your 'magizchi'
sounds so cool

1598
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:40,044
(gleeful laughter)

1599
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:03,960
'Whoever opposes 43...'

1600
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,969
'...death is a foregone conclusion'

1601
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:07,725
'Stan your work'

1602
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,362
Nayim, you must take care

1603
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,926
Hereafter it is only 43

1604
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:14,161
Go

1605
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:15,969
Let's go

1606
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:34,524
Sir, I have fixed everything
No problem whatsoever

1607
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,444
In search of Kumudha?

1608
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:02,042
That lunatic wandering here

1609
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,366
Kumudhavalli

1610
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:07,365
Valli, such a smart cookie

1611
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:10,081
My daughter sent her somewhere

1612
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:11,850
She doesn't live here now

1613
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:16,488
Her husband and newborn baby
were killed in front of her eyes it seems

1614
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:19,371
It affected her mentally

1615
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:20,641
Who are you?

1616
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:23,121
I am her husband
This is my daughter

1617
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:26,009
<i>So</i> you are not dead, huh?

1618
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,246
Oh! I see

1619
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:30,362
Hey! Give me the phone

1620
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:32,449
It will be night in USA now

1621
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:34,205
Let me try my luck

1622
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,250
My daughter isn't picking the call

1623
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:47,129
I'll let you know
after I speak to her

1624
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:49,242
You come back
the same time tomorrow

1625
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:51,004
She's on the line
Talk to her

1626
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:52,047
Hello

1627
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:53,610
How are you, dear?

1628
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:54,886
Children are fine?

1629
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:55,961
<i>'Yes, pa'</i>

1630
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,610
Someone is here
in search of Valli

1631
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,011
'The lady from Malaysia'

1632
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,281
Yes, that lady

1633
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:01,930
'She is at Penelope's, pa'

1634
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:04,327
At Penelope's house?
In France?

1635
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:06,566
Oho! Okay

1636
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:10,403
Her husband in a coat and suit
Looks like superstar!

1637
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:13,370
His daughter is also here
They look awesome

1638
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,240
Okay, will do

1639
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:18,646
Very good

1640
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:21,491
My daughter's friend
Penelope, she's French

1641
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,807
She has taken Valli
She's from France

1642
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:25,530
But settled in Pondicherry

1643
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:28,484
Might have gone to
France too, can't be sure

1644
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:31,166
I'll give you
all the contact details

1645
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,281
Thank you very much

1646
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:34,647
I believe your wife
used to keep saying

1647
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:37,206
'My husband will come for me'

1648
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,044
She has been waiting for you

1649
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:40,884
Hurry up
Go, find her

1650
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,691
You wait here
Come with me, sir

1651
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:13,091
Sir, that house over there

1652
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,486
Let's go inside and ask

1653
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,040
Aren't you Penelope?

1654
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:30,208
Who is he?
What does he want?

1655
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:31,964
Isn't this Penelope's house?

1656
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,371
'Isn't Kumudhavalli here?'

1657
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:34,646
Get out

1658
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:35,807
'Where is Penelope?'

1659
01:39:35,921 --> 01:39:37,252
Get out

1660
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,203
Shut up!
Don't act smart

1661
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:40,884
- Wretched female!
- Do you know him?

1662
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:43,088
'Your wife isn't here
She doesn't know either'

1663
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:44,650
'Let us enquire
in the neighborhood'

1664
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,046
'She must be here'

1665
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:47,971
Sir...sir

1666
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,289
Sir, I mean you

1667
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:52,280
Wait, sir

1668
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:56,008
Did you come looking for Valli?

1669
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:58,204
She was staying here

1670
01:39:58,321 --> 01:40:02,212
Penelope akka took her to
French colony in Auroville

1671
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:03,884
You can find her there

1672
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:13,883
- Who is it?
- Open the door, bro

1673
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:16,088
- Can't open now
- Your madam called us

1674
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:18,208
- Can't see her now
- Visitors from Malaysia

1675
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:19,606
Call and let your owner know

1676
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,887
- Open the gate
- I don't let anyone in after 6'0 clock

1677
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:23,405
I'm telling you they are VIPs

1678
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:25,369
- I can't let them in
- Tell them, boss

1679
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,681
'I can't call her now
Come back tomorrow'

1680
01:40:28,721 --> 01:40:30,132
Private property, sir

1681
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:31,690
Only foreigners stay here

1682
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,649
That's why they won't let us in

1683
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:35,324
Don't take it to heart, sir

1684
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:38,370
We will somehow find
your wife tomorrow, okay, sir?

1685
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,689
You go up
You wait at the rear

1686
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,246
Be alert, everyone
Ruben, be near the pool

1687
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:50,600
Sanjay, start the car

1688
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:52,449
Be on guard
You come with me

1689
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:54,249
Call if there's any emergency

1690
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:00,410
Dad, I'll get it

1691
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:06,483
He has come back again
What does he think of himself?

1692
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:07,846
- What?
- Where is sir?

1693
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,843
- Whatever it is, tell me
- I want to meet sir

1694
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:10,921
Move

1695
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,047
SIR...!

1696
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:13,970
I found your Kumudhavalli

1697
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:15,280
I saw her

1698
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:17,806
'They didn't let us in, right?
I jumped over the wall'

1699
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:20,724
Be ready tomorrow
We'll all go together, okay?

1700
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:23,280
'I spoke to Penelope
She's very happy'

1701
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:24,805
We are going tomorrow

1702
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:26,160
See you

1703
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:28,881
Dad!

1704
01:41:42,641 --> 01:41:45,963
Appa, it's 4'0 clock
and you are still awake?

1705
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,567
What is it, pa?
Go to bed please

1706
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,451
All these years she was
somewhere far away

1707
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,968
She is here close by

1708
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:56,601
What will she be thinking
while asleep?

1709
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:59,764
How will she react seeing me?
What will she think?

1710
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:02,889
Thinking of all this
my heart is beating fast, dear

1711
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,809
I feel kind of weird

1712
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:07,287
I can hear my own heartbeat

1713
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:11,089
You go to bed
Don't stay awake

1714
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,604
Sooooper, sir

1715
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:45,402
- You look totally different, pa
- I'll be seeing my Kumudhavalli

1716
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:46,720
(joyful laughter)

1717
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:48,604
- Shall we?
- Yes, sir

1718
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,523
She is in that house, sir

1719
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,206
Come, sir

1720
01:43:21,201 --> 01:43:23,203
- Hello, madam
- Oh! Hi

1721
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:25,004
I was waiting for you

1722
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:27,560
This is Kumudhavalli's husband

1723
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:30,326
- I'm happy to meet you
- Her daughter

1724
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:32,488
Come, follow me

1725
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:33,925
We can go in, sir

1726
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:35,761
Come

1727
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,530
Come

1728
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:39,846
Follow me

1729
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,570
Don't hesitate

1730
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:47,723
Valli's husband is here

1731
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:06,281
I'm going to make you wait here

1732
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,925
I'm going to fetch her

1733
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:10,242
She doesn't know
you are coming

1734
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:24,565
'Tell me who the visitor is'

1735
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:26,523
'Come, it's a surprise'

1736
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:27,886
'Just tell me'

1737
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:29,407
'Come'

1738
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:33,441
Go now

1739
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:20,766
Yogi

1740
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:22,526
Come

1741
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:27,565
Our daughter

1742
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:34,731
<i>Amman}.!</i>

1743
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:03,011
"My heart's chambers
Kaleidoscope of colors"

1744
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:09,847
"Eyes well up with tears
Rivulets of happiness"

1745
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:17,247
"Till I set eyes on you again
I was in a state forlorn"

1746
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:20,929
"I staggered across nations"

1747
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,765
"Alone, all alone in vain"

1748
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:31,131
"Million times, everyday
at death's door I stood"

1749
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:37,249
"Lonely, lost in dismay
In hope I resurrected"

1750
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,765
Everyone told me you were dea-

1751
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,205
True, I was dead

1752
01:46:41,201 --> 01:46:42,726
Until you came and saw me

1753
01:46:42,801 --> 01:46:48,649
"The river of illusion blessed
meanders down my chest"

1754
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:55,806
"Though ageing gracefully
love still blooms graciously"

1755
01:46:56,120 --> 01:47:02,321
"The magical river at my behest
weaves down my chest"

1756
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:09,166
"Though ageing years grey
love blossoms as a bouquet"

1757
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:10,930
Let's celebrate them

1758
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,001
Tonight

1759
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:13,923
Champagne!

1760
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,362
'Would we have lived in
a house like this for 2 years?'

1761
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:27,681
2 years

1762
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:29,848
2 months and 18 days

1763
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:31,884
All these 25 years...

1764
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:34,851
...I survived thinking
only of our time together

1765
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:54,530
"Adrift in the sea like a fish
I lost the love I cherished"

1766
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:59,606
"Though you are right here
I chose solitude, my dear"

1767
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:01,927
Why do you raise your tone?
Speak calmly

1768
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:08,246
"My dear night that delivers dawn!
My life only you can adorn"

1769
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:15,169
"Your pain can I share
with my tender loving care?"

1770
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:25,046
"The river of illusion blessed
meanders down my chest"

1771
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:31,363
"Though ageing grey
love blooms as a bouquet"

1772
01:48:32,241 --> 01:48:38,931
"You and I are now a strong 'we'
Equal to an elephantry"

1773
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:45,605
"Life has come afull circle
VWth its magic and miracle"

1774
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,731
Kill Kabali and his family

1775
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:56,362
- Shall we go?
- Yes, okay

1776
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:03,046
Leave the room

1777
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:06,881
Go out and wait

1778
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:08,564
(doting laughter)

1779
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:52,601
Hey! Athiya

- Hi Durai

1794
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:26,121
Meet my wife

1795
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:28,043
We'll go through
the waiting lounge, sir

1796
01:51:33,361 --> 01:51:34,522
Anna...!

1797
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:38,567
What is happening here?

1798
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:40,160
Where is Amir?

1799
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:41,406
Where is Jeeva?

1800
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:44,320
- Why were their phones unreachable?
- Don't get tense

1801
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,606
It's a different situation now

1802
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:47,091
Let's not react in haste

1803
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:48,730
What has happened?

1804
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,404
Tell me for heaven's sake

1805
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:53,811
Kabali sir, they have
attacked our school

1806
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:56,042
Amir anna has been
hospitalized, sir

1807
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,491
We shouldn't spare them

1808
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:01,288
'Don't act in haste now, sir
Listen to m-'

1809
01:52:39,601 --> 01:52:41,444
Tiger...!
Do your work

1810
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:43,767
- Tell me, Kumaran
- Amir'na, where are you?

1811
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:44,887
'At the bakery'

1812
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,962
Tony's men are planning
to demolish our school

1813
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:48,883
- Whaaaat?
- Come here immediately

1814
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:51,361
- Keep an eye here
- What happened...hey?

1815
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:58,007
Hey Jeeva

1816
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,320
'I am trapped by Tony's men'

1817
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:00,447
What are you saying?

1818
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:02,210
'I've escaped, I'll call you'

1819
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:04,721
Jeeva-

1820
01:53:21,201 --> 01:53:22,612
I'm okay

1821
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:24,810
You'll be fine

1822
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:26,729
Everything will be fine

1823
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:29,089
- Kumudha
- Sister-in-law'?

1824
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:31,242
You'll be fine
Don't worry

1825
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:32,845
Jeeva was-

1826
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:34,285
Dad...!!

1827
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:36,486
Jeeva, pa

1828
01:53:50,321 --> 01:53:51,288
You...

1829
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:53,330
...come over to my side

1830
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:55,323
All you got to do
is fix the place

1831
01:53:55,441 --> 01:53:56,966
If you do this...

1832
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:58,849
...whatever you want

1833
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:00,765
Cheeni isn't here either

1834
01:54:00,881 --> 01:54:02,690
You take full control of KL

1835
01:54:02,801 --> 01:54:04,565
Entire Kuala Lumpur?

1836
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:08,842
Sounds awesome
just hearing you say so

1837
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:13,880
We can do it

1838
01:54:14,961 --> 01:54:16,486
You're super, Jeeva

1839
01:54:16,561 --> 01:54:17,687
Simply super!

1840
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,241
Go

1841
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:21,209
Meet Tony, he's in the car

1842
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:22,645
Tony Lee...?

1843
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:31,925
- Tony Lee
- Jeeva, right?

1844
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:33,246
Good to see you

1845
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:34,441
Go...!

1846
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:44,410
Go...go...get him

1847
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:54,401
- Amir anna
- Hey! Jeeva

1848
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,926
'I am trapped by Tony's men
I've escaped, I'll call you'

1849
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:58,485
I'll call you back

1850
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:08,441
- Tell me, ma
- Where are you?

1851
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:18,447
Maaa!

1852
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:19,806
Mother?

1853
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:27,241
Ma...

1854
01:55:45,521 --> 01:55:47,046
Did you hit me?

1855
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:48,764
No, I didn't, bro

1856
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:50,330
Who is it?
Tell me

1857
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:52,046
'I will kill you'

1858
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:54,409
'Slice you into two'

1859
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,848
'Butcher you'

1860
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:03,006
<i>“wag.!</i>

1861
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:24,050
Your father should have
become a big shot you know

1862
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:27,846
Even before Kabali's entry,
your father and I were thick friends

1863
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:31,487
We were the right hand of
your grandfather Tamilnesan

1864
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:35,930
When we assumed your father
would succeed...

1865
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:41,206
...with effortless ease, Kabali pushed
your father down and usurped his place

1866
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:43,807
Your father Tamilmaran has struggled

1867
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:45,450
He has worked hard

1868
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:48,410
When a gang leader dies,
his son is the natural heir

1869
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,642
This is gang culture
And this is what your father asked

1870
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:52,603
Why did he kill your father?

1871
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:55,004
He was responsible
for his wife's death?

1872
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:56,445
But Kabali's wife now-

1873
01:58:56,561 --> 01:58:57,801
His daughter.

1874
01:58:58,360 --> 01:59:00,283
But you...your father?

1875
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:01,725
What is your situation?

1876
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:03,490
Today you are with him

1877
01:59:03,601 --> 01:59:06,127
What a wonderful way
to repay your father!

1878
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:07,321
Traitor

1879
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:09,971
It's about time

1880
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:12,202
To put everything to an end

1881
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:14,169
And you can make that happen

1882
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:16,044
If you want to be Tamilnesan...

1883
01:59:16,120 --> 01:59:17,804
...do what I say

1884
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:28,607
Tonight isAng Lee's 100th birthday

1885
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:30,210
Everyone will assemble

1886
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:31,805
You've also been invited

1887
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:34,042
If we go, we can
find them under one roof

1888
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:35,605
We can easily close their chapter

1889
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:37,523
Can't get a chance like this later

1890
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:40,524
Shut up!
His men are everywhere

1891
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:43,691
Not now, postpone this
for a few days

1892
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:45,131
What's wrong with you?

1893
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:46,725
Jeeva, Amir anna

1894
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:47,807
Next...?

1895
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:48,961
They won't stop

1896
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:50,366
This is our only chance

1897
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:52,044
If we miss this-

1898
01:59:57,160 --> 01:59:58,844
- Yogi...?
- Yes, pa

1899
01:59:58,961 --> 02:00:00,565
Ask your mother to get ready

1900
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:03,283
We are attending this party

1901
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:09,566
Kabali is coming tonight

1902
02:00:09,640 --> 02:00:10,766
Be ready

1903
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:26,489
This is the right time

1904
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:28,449
We have taken the decision

1905
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:30,244
Everyone can leave

1906
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:13,210
We are all set, come

1907
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:14,566
We'll go?

1908
02:01:18,600 --> 02:01:20,682
- Congratulations
- Thanks

1909
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:22,171
Thank you

1910
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:24,288
Thank you...thank you

1911
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:27,810
Thank you...thank you

1912
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:30,604
Very glad

1913
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:34,966
I extend a warm welcome
to this gathering

1914
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:39,610
Ang Lee is a mentor
to me and my family

1915
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:43,044
Today is his 100th birthday

1916
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:46,841
He has led a healthy life so far

1917
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:50,925
We feel proud and happy
to celebrate his 100th birthday

1918
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,525
Let's all take our glasses

1919
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:54,170
Cheers to Ang Lee's 100th birthday

1920
02:01:54,240 --> 02:01:55,241
Bottom's up

1921
02:01:57,681 --> 02:01:58,967
Lend me a hand

1922
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:00,481
"Kabali coming"

1923
02:02:00,561 --> 02:02:02,643
"Can you feel the ground shake
Like an earthquake"

1924
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:03,801
"Nowhere to run"

1925
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:05,120
"It's too late
Real gangstaz"

1926
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:07,282
"From the city to the estate
Real gangstaz"

1927
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:08,965
"Separate good from the great"

1928
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:10,530
"Keeping it straight 0G"

1929
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:12,568
"Since the 80's untouchable"

1930
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:13,926
"A.K.A Kabali".

1931
02:02:14,001 --> 02:02:16,129
"Fighting for what's right
Standing up for the weak"

1932
02:02:16,241 --> 02:02:18,926
"Looking fly kicking ass
In a suit and hockey stick"

1933
02:02:19,441 --> 02:02:20,852
Happy birthday, master

1934
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:22,410
Please sit down

1935
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:24,929
This is my wife
My daughter

1936
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,923
- You're welcome
- Happy birthday!

1937
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:31,324
Wow! Shou-Lao
God of longevity

1938
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:32,771
Humble gift

1939
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:34,285
Thank you

1940
02:02:36,081 --> 02:02:37,970
I will be there, thank you

1941
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:48,844
Let's take a selfie

1942
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:50,604
Say 'Cheese'

1943
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:00,840
Tony Lee

1944
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,490
Veerasekaran

1945
02:03:06,801 --> 02:03:08,565
How are you doing?

1946
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:11,365
Ages since we met, huh?

1947
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:13,488
(self assured laughter)

1948
02:03:14,440 --> 02:03:17,125
Looks like you're leading
a lavish lifestyle!

1949
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:18,931
No worries

1950
02:03:20,241 --> 02:03:21,891
Just wanted to touch base

1951
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:24,521
Kumudha, I guess
you recognize them?

1952
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:27,324
How can she forget?

1953
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:28,925
I will never forget

1954
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:31,165
This is me

1955
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,490
Kabali's wife

1956
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:36,364
She's my daughter

1957
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:37,806
Yogi

1958
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:41,210
Take a good look

1959
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:44,170
Let's go, dear

1960
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:47,766
At least, for 1 day

1961
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:51,403
Spend time with your family

1962
02:03:51,601 --> 02:03:53,808
Without a care in the world...

1963
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:56,491
...sleep peacefully

1964
02:03:57,720 --> 02:03:58,687
What's that?

1965
02:03:58,760 --> 02:03:59,727
Ma...

1966
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:00,767
'Magizhchi!'

1967
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:02,001
Yeah...!

1968
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:03,765
Cheers...!

1969
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:06,411
Only tonight I will sleep peacefully

1970
02:04:06,720 --> 02:04:08,290
But you?

1971
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:10,482
(arrogant laughter)

1972
02:04:11,441 --> 02:04:12,931
Cheers...!

1973
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:24,921
'Hello, Tony'

1974
02:05:25,041 --> 02:05:26,645
'Kabali is attacking us, Ia!'

1975
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:42,486
'They barged into our factory
and everything has been ruined'

1976
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:44,170
'We are finished'

1977
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:02,323
Get down...get down

1978
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:03,487
Fast

1979
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:04,647
Move

1980
02:06:04,721 --> 02:06:06,689
Drop your weapons

1981
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:09,170
Get back

1982
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:21,050
Check the containers

1983
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:23,282
'The Police have entered
our container yard'

1984
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:25,328
'They have seized all our stock'

1985
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,240
'House is on fire'

1986
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:37,890
'We don't know
what's going on'

1987
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:50,370
'Shares are going down'

1988
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:57,043
'I mean this is a disaster'

1989
02:07:05,841 --> 02:07:07,127
Veera-

1990
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:10,206
(gunshot)

1991
02:07:10,321 --> 02:07:11,527
(screams of panic)

1992
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:56,886
'Cheers...!'

1993
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:04,607
Stop him

1994
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:06,170
Are you the ruling family?

1995
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:07,327
Stop it!

1996
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:09,050
Yearning to come into power?

1997
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:10,406
You stop that-

1998
02:08:10,481 --> 02:08:13,132
Did you own 1 cent
of land in this country?

1999
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:14,571
'What's happening?'

2000
02:08:14,641 --> 02:08:17,121
You want to rule
the whole of Malaysia?

2001
02:08:19,320 --> 02:08:22,847
You didn't get a morsel of rice to eat
when you came to Tamilnesan

2002
02:08:23,640 --> 02:08:26,211
Why didn't you just eat and leave?

2003
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:27,890
If you dress like him...

2004
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:29,803
...can you become Tamilnesan?

2005
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:32,369
It has to be in your genes, man

2006
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:34,442
Who and what you are!

2007
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:35,567
Stop...!

2008
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:38,450
I knocked off Tamilnesan
who was such a big wig

2009
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:40,130
Don't be so rude

2010
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:41,167
Stop...!

2011
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:47,241
As long as I am alive
you cannot fulfill your dreams

2012
02:09:00,721 --> 02:09:02,246
I am not from a ruling family

2013
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:03,850
But I am born to rule!

2014
02:09:03,921 --> 02:09:05,411
KABALI, I say

2015
02:09:17,200 --> 02:09:18,725
Master, are you okay?

2016
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:25,080
Go...go...go

2017
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:40,088
Calm down, Tony

2018
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:41,771
Tony, calm down please

2019
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:42,802
I am sorry

2020
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:45,400
How the hell
did he pull this, huh?

2021
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:47,921
No

2022
02:09:48,240 --> 02:09:50,811
Kabali and his men
must die tonight

2023
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:53,611
Only 1 man can walk out
from here breathing

2024
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:55,245
This has to happen

2025
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,446
Hey! Kabali has to die

2026
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:00,921
Search for Kumaran

2027
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:04,565
Quick!

2028
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:12,767
Kabali's daughter
In our hands now!

2029
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:15,409
Come to the store
in the east wing

2030
02:10:16,241 --> 02:10:17,686
Let us kill Kabali
in our den

2031
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:19,928
He has to answer
for my father's death

2032
02:10:24,040 --> 02:10:26,771
'Kabali's daughter
In our hands now!'

2033
02:10:27,121 --> 02:10:29,010
'Come to the store
in the east wing'

2034
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:45,481
'bfilait...wait

2035
02:10:45,600 --> 02:10:46,840
Something is wrong

2036
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:49,205
Doesn't feel right

2037
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:53,443
He shouldn't decide the place

2038
02:10:54,001 --> 02:10:55,651
Ask him to come to us

2039
02:10:56,760 --> 02:10:58,171
Send for him

2040
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:28,327
Good!

2041
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:32,123
Tony, they are here

2042
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:41,088
Call her father now
He will show up

2043
02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:51,967
Tony Lee and Veerasekaran spoke to me
They wanted me to betray you

2044
02:11:52,040 --> 02:11:56,170
If I bring you to their den, they will
make me the next Tamilnesan then

2045
02:11:57,320 --> 02:11:59,971
They tried to provoke me
like they did to my father

2046
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:01,811
Shouldn't let them win

2047
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:03,206
I am Tamilnesan's grandson

2048
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:06,124
I'll come forward and give up
even my life for Kabali sir

2049
02:12:38,680 --> 02:12:40,921
Hey Kabali!

2050
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:44,006
You thought you could
get away with this

2051
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:46,127
Come

2052
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:48,609
I was waiting for you

2053
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:51,641
Trying to play your games with me!

2054
02:12:52,680 --> 02:12:55,365
You've come in
at the right moment

2055
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:03,881
Yes...Tony

2056
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:06,847
You bet I've come
at the right moment

2057
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:10,243
I've also been waiting for
this moment for a very long time

2058
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:13,211
Looking good

2059
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:15,086
The suit...

2060
02:13:15,240 --> 02:13:16,844
...fits perfectly for you

2061
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:18,086
(confident laughter)

2062
02:13:18,280 --> 02:13:19,202
Thank you

2063
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:20,526
Cheers!

2064
02:13:20,640 --> 02:13:22,563
That is the speciality
of this material

2065
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:27,004
No caste attached to it whether
a millionaire or a poor man wears it

2066
02:13:27,120 --> 02:13:30,249
But man's mind
I must say...bah!

2067
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:32,924
If at all I have another birth...

2068
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,048
...I must never be born a human

2069
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:37,003
Yes, for sure

2070
02:13:37,880 --> 02:13:41,123
Men like you should not
be born as a human being again!

2071
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:43,769
You are not qualified

2072
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:45,681
After all...

2073
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:49,251
...you are a Tamil Kling, right?

2074
02:13:49,361 --> 02:13:50,647
I have an idea

2075
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:53,365
You should be a dog

2076
02:13:53,880 --> 02:13:55,041
My dog

2077
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,365
(mimicking a dog's bark)

2078
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:04,364
(brazen laughter)

2079
02:14:06,001 --> 02:14:07,127
Listen, man

2080
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:11,245
Leaving behind our kith and kin,
our motherland and settling here...

2081
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:13,966
...we made forests
into fertile fields

2082
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:15,969
We are trampled by the Malaysians

2083
02:14:16,040 --> 02:14:18,850
You Chinese do the same
Plus the Tamilians

2084
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:22,001
Should Tamilians only be slaves?

2085
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:23,884
Should never progress in life?

2086
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,968
If someone comes
to the forefront...

2087
02:14:26,080 --> 02:14:27,605
...into a powerful position

2088
02:14:27,761 --> 02:14:30,412
...dresses in a suit and
sits crosslegged before you

2089
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:31,931
...you can't digest it

2090
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:34,003
I agree, I am a man
of humble beginnings

2091
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:36,560
I'll go back to cutting trees
and plucking fruits

2092
02:14:36,640 --> 02:14:39,041
I will continue slogging
I have nothing to lose

2093
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:42,403
If you think I should not climb up
the ladder, I swear I will!

2094
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:44,250
You bet I'll wear a coat

2095
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:47,683
I'll cross my legs and sit
in style, showing attitude

2096
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:50,966
If you can't handle it
then go to your grave!

2097
02:14:58,280 --> 02:15:00,408
"Like fire blazing fiercely"

2098
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:07,971
"Fire in all its fury
Try confronting me"

2099
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:10,327
"if you do
we will char you"

2100
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:12,966
"To thrash and trample"

2101
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:15,686
"Even in your dreams is it possible?"

2102
02:15:28,480 --> 02:15:31,086
"if pushed around
will you bow down?"

2103
02:15:31,160 --> 02:15:33,527
"To bullying will you buckle?"

2104
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:36,081
"Will you heed any hurdle?"

2105
02:15:36,200 --> 02:15:39,204
"Dawn's new identity
Our very own Kabali"

2106
02:16:14,720 --> 02:16:17,326
"Defer mercy
Sever worry"

2107
02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:19,886
"Be patient, just a bit
Your heart can beat it"

2108
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,048
"Everything here is magical illusion"

2109
02:16:22,160 --> 02:16:24,686
"Your bravery will start a revolution"

2110
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:27,007
"Righteous rage all the way through"

2111
02:16:27,200 --> 02:16:30,602
"Just one word from you
the world will change anew"

2112
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:42,964
"Kabali the revolutionary"

2113
02:16:43,880 --> 02:16:45,484
"Kabali the visionary"

2114
02:16:46,360 --> 02:16:48,089
"Kabali super-vigilante"

2115
02:16:48,881 --> 02:16:50,042
Kabali!!

2116
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:02,611
Kabali!!

2117
02:18:02,801 --> 02:18:04,087
Forgive me

2118
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:05,965
Let's start fresh

2119
02:18:06,321 --> 02:18:08,403
KL, Malaysia

2120
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:10,762
Is all yours

2121
02:18:10,880 --> 02:18:12,644
I'll support V°u

2122
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:14,644
Hereafter you are the king

2123
02:18:14,760 --> 02:18:16,091
You are the king

2124
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:17,042
Cheers...!!

2125
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:19,401
No, please
Kabali...no!

2126
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:17,807
- Congratulations
- Thank you very much

2127
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:20,050
Welcome, sir
Hello, pa

2128
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:28,048
Meena, put it in a plastic bag

2129
02:19:29,480 --> 02:19:31,084
Good...good...good

2130
02:19:32,440 --> 02:19:33,771
Meena takes care of our schoo-

2131
02:19:33,880 --> 02:19:36,724
She is very responsible
Does a great job

2132
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:38,171
That's true, pa

2133
02:19:38,280 --> 02:19:39,725
I don't cry nowadays

2134
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:41,205
Very good

2135
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:52,488
Kumudha, hereafter
we have 1 more daughter

2136
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:53,961
Meena, right?

2137
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:55,810
Even I thought so

2138
02:19:56,880 --> 02:19:58,166
Thank you

2139
02:20:09,560 --> 02:20:11,210
We've just finished 12th grade

2140
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:13,004
We'll get our results
after 2 months

2141
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:16,249
- Then do what?
- She excels in her studies

2142
02:20:16,560 --> 02:20:18,483
There's no chance
in hell I will pass

2143
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:21,041
But we are more or less
sailing in the same boat

2144
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:23,680
You're angry we are
being misused

2145
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:27,168
But however well we study
opportunities are less here for us

2146
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:30,642
We will get admission for
some unheard of course

2147
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:34,162
We'll end up borrowing money
to study in a private college

2148
02:20:34,280 --> 02:20:35,770
Why are you telling me all this?

2149
02:20:35,880 --> 02:20:39,043
We think only you can
solve our problems, anna

2150
02:20:40,720 --> 02:20:42,051
I am a rowdy

2151
02:20:42,320 --> 02:20:43,526
General opinion

2152
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:45,365
Fine, I accept
I am a rowdy

2153
02:20:45,560 --> 02:20:47,085
I've studied a little bit
