3
00:03:59,836 --> 00:04:03,252
Hello! Where's your boss?

4
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:07,734
Why don't you answer me? Insolent!

5
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,223
Listen! It's futile
to get angry at him.

6
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:14,130
He's deaf and dumb. What do you want?

7
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:17,665
I want to meet Mr. Shrinath.

8
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:21,152
He's in that room.
But why do you want to meet him?

9
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,641
I'll tell only to him.

10
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:34,782
Misappropriation of Rs.10000!

11
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:37,082
If it's not rectified
within three days..

12
00:04:37,123 --> 00:04:39,018
Then I'll not only sack you..

13
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,840
- But also put you in prison.
- But sir..

14
00:04:43,203 --> 00:04:45,231
Who are you?
Why are you coming inside?

15
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:50,584
Today, you didn't even recognize
your elder brother, Shrinath.

16
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:53,539
Brother Dinanath!

17
00:04:54,355 --> 00:04:58,646
You're stunned as
if you've seen a ghost!

18
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:02,688
- I had heard that you..
- That I am dead.

19
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:09,922
There's just a small gap of only four
fingers between the eyes and ears.

20
00:05:10,634 --> 00:05:14,005
What's heard is a lie..

21
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,695
And what's seen is the truth.

22
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:21,422
Why are you still
standing here? Go on!

23
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:26,229
How long have you been having this?

24
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:30,255
This has been my condition
for the past two years.

25
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:34,619
Why have you come here?

26
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:38,536
Its not necessary that
an elder brother should..

27
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:42,369
Have a reason for visiting
his younger brother.

28
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,675
I don't think you have
come here without any reason.

29
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,785
Monetary reasons
have brought you here.

30
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:51,494
That day you fought
with father and left home.

31
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:55,056
Landlords are evil.
They exploit poor people!

32
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:57,933
It's a sin to even live
in the house of such a cruel man.

33
00:05:58,028 --> 00:06:00,494
Why, isn't it a sin
to return to this house?

34
00:06:01,715 --> 00:06:04,869
Helplessness makes you forget
virtues and sins, Shrinath.

35
00:06:05,985 --> 00:06:09,160
When a man fails to
find a place in the world..

36
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,619
He takes shelter in his own house.

37
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:14,751
His own house?!

38
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:21,709
Brother Dinanath, don't forget that
you have no right over this house.

39
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:24,294
Father has even disinherited Pitambar!

40
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,446
Because he got married in
a low class family against his wish.

41
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:31,126
Now this house belongs only to me.
This inheritance is mine.

42
00:06:31,713 --> 00:06:33,626
Father has made me
the sole heir in his will.

43
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:36,459
But I had heard..

44
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,741
That in the final moments..

45
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:44,584
Father had prepared a
new will to atone his mistakes.

46
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:47,001
- New will deed?
- Yes.

47
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:51,770
In that, Pitambar and
I were equally entitled..

48
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,645
To inherit the wealth and not you.

49
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,270
So, you have come
here to claim your right.

50
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:03,145
Where is that will? Who has seen it?

51
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,895
Who are the witnesses?

52
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:08,145
I don't know all that.

53
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:10,811
So, you're just making empty threats!

54
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:13,954
If you want your right, then
go to the court! It's always open!

55
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,478
Shrinath!

56
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,645
Why are you saying this, Shrinath?

57
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:25,573
I'm a sick man.

58
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,308
I might die at any time.

59
00:07:29,134 --> 00:07:31,503
Old and handicapped.

60
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:34,190
My only desire..

61
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:39,532
Is to get a square
meal for the rest of my days.

62
00:07:41,014 --> 00:07:46,230
It won't hurt you,
if I live in some corner..

63
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:48,980
Of this huge house.

64
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:51,271
Now, you've come to the point!

65
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:57,105
But giving shelter to a man
like you is nonetheless dangerous.

66
00:07:57,676 --> 00:08:00,438
What are you saying, Shrinath?

67
00:08:01,468 --> 00:08:02,744
Don't you remember?

68
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:05,762
During childhood, you took advantage
of the fact that we were identical..

69
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,520
And constantly humiliated me.

70
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,103
Why are you digging up the past?

71
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,770
What if you get greedy
for inheritance?

72
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:19,603
No, no, Shrinath!

73
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:23,895
I wasn't interested
in the wealth then..

74
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:25,728
And I'm not interested in it now.

75
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:30,145
Alright, you can stay here.

76
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:34,395
But remember..

77
00:08:34,606 --> 00:08:39,353
I kill the enemy before he can strike!

78
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:43,873
Manager!

79
00:08:47,184 --> 00:08:48,395
Manager!

80
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:52,932
- Yes, sir.
- Look, my brother will stay here.

81
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:54,591
Make arrangement
for his accommodation..

82
00:08:54,615 --> 00:08:55,736
In the room adjacent to mine.

83
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,906
Okay.

84
00:08:58,395 --> 00:09:00,853
And, listen,
I'm going to the city in the evening.

85
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:03,620
- Tell the driver to keep the car ready.
- Alright.

86
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:52,311
"Where are you going,
taking my heart?"

87
00:09:52,562 --> 00:09:56,521
"Where are you going,
taking my heart?"

88
00:09:57,161 --> 00:10:00,779
"Decision of your and
my heart is still to be taken."

89
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:05,021
"Taking my heart.."

90
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:15,562
"After loving you,
the illusion broke."

91
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:20,521
"Not to love people who flatter you."

92
00:10:22,341 --> 00:10:26,312
"After loving you,
the illusion broke."

93
00:10:26,562 --> 00:10:30,854
"Not to love people who flatter you."

94
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:35,396
"The heart won't hurt.
This heart is better off alone."

95
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:39,979
"Where are you going,
taking my heart?"

96
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:44,312
"Where are you going,
taking my heart?"

97
00:10:44,973 --> 00:10:48,646
"Decision of your and
my heart is still to be taken."

98
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:53,062
"Taking my heart.."

99
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:06,768
"Don't sigh, it doesn't affect me."

100
00:11:06,848 --> 00:11:11,396
"I understand the glance.
Don't make fake promises."

101
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:17,521
"Don't sigh, it doesn't affect me."

102
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:22,465
"I understand the glance.
Don't make fake promises."

103
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:26,396
"The heart won't hurt.
Cast spell on others."

104
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:30,896
"Where are you going,
taking my heart?"

105
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:35,583
"Where are you going,
taking my heart?"

106
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:39,562
"Decision of your and
my heart is still to be taken."

107
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:44,146
"Taking my heart.."

108
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:03,304
"Don't be fervent. It's my heart."

109
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,739
"You can change. It's your heart."

110
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,997
"Don't be fervent. It's my heart."

111
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:19,285
"You can change. It's your heart."

112
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:23,098
"Oh, heartbroken,
don't break my heart."

113
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:27,982
"Where are you going,
taking my heart?"

114
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:32,338
"Where are you going,
taking my heart?"

115
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:36,271
"Decision of your and
my heart is still to be taken."

116
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:41,521
"Taking my heart.."

117
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,937
Shrinath, you? Did you call me here?

118
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:02,283
Yes.

119
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:04,342
What's the matter that
you called me here this way..

120
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,685
Through Lily rather
than coming home?

121
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:09,246
Method should be adopted to
suit the situation, Mr. Rai Bahadur.

122
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:13,699
I want the will that
father gave you before dying.

123
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:16,960
Why do you suddenly need that will?

124
00:13:18,158 --> 00:13:21,574
I should get the thing
I've already paid for.

125
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:24,158
I think, you no longer trust me.

126
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:28,658
Maybe you are scared because
Dinanath has suddenly returned.

127
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:30,647
No need to get scared.

128
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:33,649
Tell me.
How much can you pay me for that?

129
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,274
Why? Isn't the 20,000 I paid, enough?

130
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:42,607
That was merely my
fees to keep silent.

131
00:13:43,693 --> 00:13:48,899
Now that Dinanath has returned,
the will's price has increased.

132
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:51,929
To acquire an inheritance
worth two million..

133
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:54,478
Dinanath can pay
a few thousands himself.

134
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:57,270
You are betraying me!
You are cheating me!

135
00:13:57,943 --> 00:14:00,520
Do you know what will
be the outcome of your deceit?

136
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:02,029
For me or for you?

137
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:05,229
I'll teach you a lesson
that you'll never forget!

138
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,832
Shrinath!
No need to lose your control.

139
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:11,466
If I want, I can make you a pauper!

140
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:13,629
You're threatening me!
Who do you think you are!

141
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:14,613
- Let's decide right away!
- Beware!

142
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:17,111
What is this? What are you doing?

143
00:14:17,226 --> 00:14:19,910
- Lily, you don't know!
- You don't know!

144
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:22,851
Right now, Mr.
Rai Bahadur is my guest.

145
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:24,310
I have invited him.

146
00:14:25,162 --> 00:14:26,364
Its okay, Lily.

147
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:32,958
- I, Jankinath, swear to avenge my humiliation!
- Rai Bahadur!

148
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,101
Please! Listen to me!

149
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:39,076
He's gone!

150
00:14:40,607 --> 00:14:44,101
You didn't do the right thing!
Now, you won't get the will.

151
00:14:44,943 --> 00:14:47,601
I'll get it by any means necessary.

152
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:49,851
But how? How?

153
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:51,857
Leave that to me.

154
00:14:52,838 --> 00:14:55,642
But, darling, you'll have to help me.

155
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:57,934
- Sure.
- Let's go.

156
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:31,846
Honestly, I've had enough.
I feel as if I'll faint.

157
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:35,241
Is that so? You rest, darling.

158
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:36,578
I'll leave.

159
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:40,953
You've just arrived.
You've hardly sit or had anything.

160
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:44,203
- What's the hurry to leave?
- I'm leaving today.

161
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:46,869
- I'll come back tomorrow.
- Will you surely come?

162
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:48,161
Sure.

163
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,411
Goodnight! I'm leaving.

164
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:57,453
- Close the door.
- Listen!

165
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:03,411
Gone!

166
00:16:04,157 --> 00:16:05,703
As you wish!

167
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:07,786
Goodnight!

168
00:16:12,782 --> 00:16:16,679
- It took you so long!
- The job took long that's why I got late.

169
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:21,554
This is the key to the safe.
The back door is open.

170
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,262
What about him? What's his condition?

171
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:26,877
First, he was intoxicated.
Now, he's unconsciousness.

172
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,846
But take care. Be careful!

173
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,096
- I know.
- Good luck!

174
00:18:57,306 --> 00:18:58,390
Who is it?

175
00:18:59,725 --> 00:19:01,460
- Shrinath, you!
- Yes!

176
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,257
It's me, Shrinath!

177
00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:09,117
Give me the will, immediately!

178
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:11,335
Give me the key.

179
00:19:12,678 --> 00:19:13,871
Give me.

180
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:08,906
Manager!

181
00:20:10,518 --> 00:20:11,697
- Where were you?
- Yes, sir!

182
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:13,901
- Were you asleep?
- Yes, sir!

183
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:15,901
- It's quite late.
- What's the time?

184
00:20:16,796 --> 00:20:18,901
- 2:30am!
- Its 2:30am!

185
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,039
- Call the nurse!
- She took leave and has gone to the city.

186
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:26,924
- She'll return tomorrow.
- Why are you staring at me?

187
00:20:26,948 --> 00:20:27,948
Where's the doctor?

188
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:31,940
Doctor!

189
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:34,607
I'm feeling very nervous!

190
00:20:34,821 --> 00:20:37,405
- I'm feeling a strange terror!
- Terror?

191
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,292
Yes. As I was returning
from the city..

192
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:41,165
I felt as if somebody
was following me.

193
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:43,161
- Somebody wants to kill me.
- No, no.

194
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:44,285
It must be your delusion.

195
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,577
I'm troubled and you're
talking about delusions!

196
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,828
No need to worry.
I'll just give you the injection.

197
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,743
Injection!

198
00:20:52,488 --> 00:20:53,761
For the past two years, you've been..

199
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,585
Giving me injections
and weakening my body!

200
00:20:55,702 --> 00:20:57,484
You stand around talking
about an injection..

201
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:58,925
While someone comes and stab me!

202
00:20:59,702 --> 00:21:00,702
Manager..

203
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,553
I've heard about a private
detective named Rajesh in the city.

204
00:21:03,577 --> 00:21:04,992
- Wire him to come over immediately.
- Okay.

205
00:21:05,016 --> 00:21:07,827
- I'll pay him handsomely.
- Okay, sir.

206
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:11,892
Murder!

207
00:21:12,143 --> 00:21:16,590
Rai Bahadur Jankinath
has been murdered!

208
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:20,493
What a strange world!
Murder for every trivial matter.

209
00:21:20,818 --> 00:21:23,732
People's life is no longer precious.

210
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:24,861
Amazing!

211
00:21:45,942 --> 00:21:48,392
Excuse me,
ma'am, whoever you are, come in.

212
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:03,180
I want to meet Mr. Rajesh Kumar.

213
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,920
That's obvious. If you didn't
want to meet him, why would you come?

214
00:22:07,303 --> 00:22:08,731
Are you Mr. Rajesh Kumar?

215
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:11,390
What's it to you.
Tell me what do you want?

216
00:22:13,163 --> 00:22:16,914
- Was there a robbery, theft or a murder?
- Murder!

217
00:22:17,156 --> 00:22:18,666
I think it's a murder case.

218
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:20,417
Now look what happened last night.

219
00:22:20,497 --> 00:22:22,656
Rai Bahadur Jankinath was murdered.

220
00:22:23,562 --> 00:22:24,753
The police are searching
for the culprit.

221
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:28,364
But think what will the
police do till we send them help?

222
00:22:28,544 --> 00:22:32,197
Do you have any name and
whereabouts of your murderer?

223
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:33,682
- My murderer?
- Yes, yours!

224
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:34,992
Tell me. Go on.

225
00:22:35,352 --> 00:22:36,756
- I think, I've come to the wrong place.
- No!

226
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,992
It's the right place.

227
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:43,822
- Then maybe you are not in your senses!
- That's not it.

228
00:22:44,174 --> 00:22:48,694
- I think it's not a murder case. It's a love affair.
- Love!

229
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,951
Yes! You've been unsuccessful in love!

230
00:22:50,992 --> 00:22:56,031
- And your lover is blackmailing you.
- Stop your ranting!

231
00:22:56,721 --> 00:22:58,031
Claims to be a detective!

232
00:22:58,172 --> 00:22:59,337
You published the advertisement
in the newspaper..

233
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:00,521
And you opened the office!

234
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,398
If I had known this is the detective
work that you learnt abroad..

235
00:23:03,422 --> 00:23:05,156
Then I would've never come here!

236
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:13,865
Good morning, sir!
Sir, she's come to meet you.

237
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,858
Tell me. What has brought you here?

238
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,316
And you are?

239
00:23:20,612 --> 00:23:22,418
He's my boss.

240
00:23:23,012 --> 00:23:25,514
And I'm his slave,
helper, employee and a servant.

241
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:26,850
Meaning his assistant.

242
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:28,627
But you just said that you are..

243
00:23:28,806 --> 00:23:31,542
You misunderstood.

244
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,151
- Did she make a mistake or you didn't tell her?
- Yes, sir!

245
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:35,672
Fool! Get out!

246
00:23:35,752 --> 00:23:37,774
Forgive me! Forgive me, ma'am!

247
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:42,233
- I'm sorry for Balram's behaviour.
- It's okay.

248
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:47,067
- Mr. Rajesh, I've some urgent work with you.
- Sit.

249
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,510
Excuse me.

250
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,780
Hello!

251
00:23:57,154 --> 00:23:58,858
This is Rajesh speaking.

252
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:01,733
Tell me, inspector.

253
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,100
Fingerprint report.

254
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:06,417
But whose?

255
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:08,566
Fine.

256
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,802
Send the file immediately
along with the Superintendent.

257
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:14,420
I'll be there in half an hour.
Is that fine?

258
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:16,316
Thank you.

259
00:24:21,615 --> 00:24:22,774
Tell me.

260
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:24,691
My name is Shobha.

261
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:30,358
- I've come to make a request.
- Tell me, how can I help you?

262
00:24:30,691 --> 00:24:32,108
You'll have to come with me.

263
00:24:32,494 --> 00:24:33,774
Where? Jeetpur?

264
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,774
How did you know?

265
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,898
You're forgetting
that I'm a detective.

266
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:43,732
My boss is not just a detective.
He is also a psychic.

267
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:47,098
Yes. Even if you don't tell him,
still he can tell you..

268
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:49,773
About your past, present and future.

269
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:52,773
- Idiot! - Yes, sir!
- Get out! - Sorry.

270
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:57,231
So what business
do you have in Jeetpur?

271
00:24:58,425 --> 00:24:59,773
I'll tell you when we get there.

272
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:02,008
No, you'll have to tell me here.

273
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:05,208
Else, how will I know whether
I can or can't do this work?

274
00:25:05,327 --> 00:25:06,699
You can surely do it.

275
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,825
Look, there's a rule in my work.
There's a method.

276
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,895
If you don't want to tell me,
then it will be very difficult for me.

277
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:16,201
Listen! I'll tell you.

278
00:25:17,447 --> 00:25:20,769
Actually the thing is that
I want to acquire something.

279
00:25:22,343 --> 00:25:23,727
You want to acquire something?

280
00:25:24,227 --> 00:25:26,019
Means, I want to seize something.

281
00:25:27,394 --> 00:25:28,477
You didn't understand?

282
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,878
Say that I want to steal something.

283
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:35,227
What?

284
00:25:36,191 --> 00:25:39,532
- Yes.
- Then you have come to the wrong person.

285
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:43,226
Wrong person? Aren't you Mr. Rajesh?

286
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,323
I'm Rajesh. But I don't steal.

287
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:47,888
I nab the thief.

288
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:51,115
To steal something,
you will have to go to a thief's den.

289
00:25:51,723 --> 00:25:55,306
- This is a detective's office.
- Why are you distorting facts?

290
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,948
Say clearly that you
want more fees for this work.

291
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,990
I'm not like the kind people who
do everything for the sake of money.

292
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:05,907
Don't waste my time.
I've some urgent work.

293
00:26:06,657 --> 00:26:09,115
- Think once more.
- I've decided.

294
00:26:12,617 --> 00:26:13,779
Fine.

295
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,198
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

296
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:21,657
Sorry, boss. But you had
a tiff early in the morning too.

297
00:26:22,428 --> 00:26:23,532
What a strange girl!

298
00:26:24,474 --> 00:26:26,532
She's asking a detective
to help her to steal.

299
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:30,407
No matter, boss. The case was
very interesting and beautiful too.

300
00:26:30,516 --> 00:26:33,141
If you had taken up the case,
it would have been good, but you..

301
00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:34,532
Sir,

302
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,865
Jeetpur's affluent man
Shrinath's life is in danger.

303
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,823
He has called me immediately.

304
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:54,532
Strange! That girl
too had come from Jeetpur.

305
00:26:55,953 --> 00:26:57,157
I should go there.

306
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:01,725
But the policemen said they saw..

307
00:27:01,766 --> 00:27:06,050
A man with a girl,
wearing our dress.

308
00:27:06,717 --> 00:27:09,175
But how did the police came
here on the basis of the dress?

309
00:27:09,385 --> 00:27:10,592
Forget it!

310
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:17,008
The police did not find
out that I was there with you.

311
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,570
But how did this get published
in the evening newspaper?

312
00:27:19,627 --> 00:27:20,960
That the police have found a clue.

313
00:27:20,984 --> 00:27:22,624
And the murderer will
be nabbed very soon.

314
00:27:23,456 --> 00:27:25,383
Must be the police's ruse.

315
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:29,133
I think you've left your clue there.

316
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,258
Anyway. Whatever happened was bad.

317
00:27:32,871 --> 00:27:33,871
Very bad!

318
00:27:35,508 --> 00:27:37,592
Had I known that you
would commit murder..

319
00:27:37,717 --> 00:27:39,717
I would have never helped you.

320
00:27:40,508 --> 00:27:42,908
Believe me, darling. I didn't
commit the murder deliberately.

321
00:27:43,758 --> 00:27:45,717
Because of nervousness, anxiety..

322
00:27:46,071 --> 00:27:47,671
Fear, something happened that..

323
00:27:48,017 --> 00:27:49,425
Now, don't talk about it.

324
00:27:50,129 --> 00:27:53,925
Even the walls have ears. Stay alert!

325
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:57,217
Don't come to meet me for a few days.

326
00:27:58,441 --> 00:27:59,508
Alright, darling.

327
00:28:00,465 --> 00:28:03,425
But if you receive any news
from the police, call me immediately.

328
00:28:03,758 --> 00:28:04,842
I'll surely inform you.

329
00:28:07,383 --> 00:28:09,342
- Goodnight, darling!
- Goodnight!

330
00:28:19,108 --> 00:28:20,191
I got late.

331
00:28:21,358 --> 00:28:23,483
You people have still not started.

332
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:25,233
Carry on!

333
00:28:32,716 --> 00:28:36,424
Brother you can't use
your right hand at all?

334
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,737
No, Shrinath.

335
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:43,450
Doctor did you check him?

336
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:45,154
Yes. It's an old ailment.

337
00:28:45,573 --> 00:28:46,779
Seems to be incurable.

338
00:28:47,822 --> 00:28:51,570
Nonsense! Being a doctor,
you are sounding so bleak.

339
00:28:51,821 --> 00:28:53,154
Research it!

340
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:57,653
I've opened a laboratory for you.
I've given you all the equipments.

341
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:02,445
Still if brother can't
be cured then what's the use?

342
00:29:04,124 --> 00:29:05,362
But Mr. Shrinath..

343
00:29:05,653 --> 00:29:09,362
When the aliment is advanced
then medicine doesn't work.

344
00:29:09,951 --> 00:29:11,987
No, no! That's not possible!

345
00:29:12,524 --> 00:29:15,737
Doctor, begin the treatment.
Understand?

346
00:29:16,181 --> 00:29:20,556
Sir, detective Rajesh
Nath has arrived from the city.

347
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:22,785
Fine. Ask him to sit.

348
00:29:31,949 --> 00:29:33,699
Sir!

349
00:29:34,657 --> 00:29:37,490
That statue must be
around 2000 years old!

350
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,319
Its craftsmanship reveals
that the craftsman..

351
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,782
Must be from China or Egypt.

352
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:46,048
Balram..

353
00:29:46,165 --> 00:29:49,407
It would have been better if
you had left your brain at the office.

354
00:29:50,477 --> 00:29:52,490
I think you are Mr. Rajesh.

355
00:29:52,868 --> 00:29:54,524
Yes. Greetings.

356
00:29:54,604 --> 00:29:56,719
Greetings. Who's he?

357
00:29:57,013 --> 00:30:00,472
- He has come with me.
- Please tell him to go out.

358
00:30:00,587 --> 00:30:01,724
Balram.

359
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:04,092
Sorry, but I'm his assistant.

360
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:06,472
- Go out.
- Okay.

361
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:09,555
I came as soon as
I received your telegram.

362
00:30:09,884 --> 00:30:13,688
But the manager didn't tell me about
the precise danger you are facing.

363
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:15,805
I had written that
my life is in danger.

364
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:18,931
- Do you have any enemies?
- Enemies?

365
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:22,641
- No one I know.
- Do you doubt anybody?

366
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,625
In nervousness,
a person doubts everybody.

367
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:28,307
But I don't doubt
any particular person.

368
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:30,651
But what could be
the reason of danger?

369
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:34,443
I don't know.
Why don't you find out, Mr. Rajesh?

370
00:30:34,873 --> 00:30:36,485
I've called you for my safety.

371
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,943
- Sir.
- What happened?

372
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:39,693
- Your medicine.
- Medicine?

373
00:30:42,776 --> 00:30:43,860
You can leave.

374
00:30:54,122 --> 00:30:57,652
Mr. Rajesh, I'm a bit tired.

375
00:30:59,755 --> 00:31:02,944
I'll leave for now.
I'll talk to you in the morning.

376
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:06,985
And, yes, I'll make
arrangement for your stay here.

377
00:31:07,731 --> 00:31:09,360
Thank you. Don't worry. Goodnight.

378
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,078
Mr. Rajesh, come.
I'll show you your room.

379
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,021
I'm sorry.

380
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:39,870
The room is locked.
You go ahead, I'll get the keys.

381
00:32:04,732 --> 00:32:05,818
You?

382
00:32:06,734 --> 00:32:08,442
I ask you the same question too.

383
00:32:09,277 --> 00:32:12,153
- I work here.
- And I have been called here.

384
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,908
- Who has called you?
- Mr. Shrinath.

385
00:32:14,949 --> 00:32:18,364
- Why?
- I think something fishy is going on.

386
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:22,344
Mr. Shrinath's life is in danger.
And you like to rob.

387
00:32:23,237 --> 00:32:23,929
Nurse!

388
00:32:24,056 --> 00:32:25,818
I'll meet you later!

389
00:32:28,931 --> 00:32:31,820
Sorry, Mr. Rajesh. You had to wait.

390
00:32:32,557 --> 00:32:33,563
Come with me.

391
00:32:42,787 --> 00:32:44,162
Which is Mr. Shrinath's room?

392
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,124
- Second room from there.
- What about the nurse?

393
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:52,655
- What?
- I'm a detective.

394
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:54,492
I need to know everything.

395
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,749
Why not?
She lives in the adjacent room.

396
00:32:59,198 --> 00:33:00,436
Go and rest.

397
00:33:00,815 --> 00:33:04,265
And, yes, tell Balram
that I'm staying in this room.

398
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:06,144
Okay.

399
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,593
Beware!

400
00:33:31,447 --> 00:33:33,988
If you move, I'll shoot!

401
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:36,127
Look, I'm not lying!
I have a pistol in my pocket.

402
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:38,229
Tell me, what were
you both scheming about?

403
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:40,202
What? What ice cream?

404
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:41,702
Not an ice cream! Scheme!

405
00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:44,569
I've caught you both red-handed!
Tell me, what's your intention?

406
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:48,200
But, who are you?!
That you are bossing over us!

407
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,830
Is that so? You're very innocent!

408
00:33:50,221 --> 00:33:53,744
Quietly accept your crime!
Else, I'll get both of you hanged!

409
00:33:54,229 --> 00:33:57,744
Don't talk too much!
Don't you know who I am!

410
00:33:58,026 --> 00:33:59,595
I don't know from
where you've come from.

411
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:01,229
Have the nerve to threaten me!
Get lost!

412
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,744
Let it be! Mind your tongue!

413
00:34:02,785 --> 00:34:05,285
Do you know who I am!
I'll teach you both a lesson!

414
00:34:06,371 --> 00:34:08,118
You'll do that later!

415
00:34:08,681 --> 00:34:10,121
First, I'll teach you a lesson!

416
00:34:10,335 --> 00:34:13,139
Champa! What are
you quarrelling about?

417
00:34:13,525 --> 00:34:16,161
Manager, hand them over to the police!

418
00:34:16,202 --> 00:34:18,042
God only knows,
what they were gesturing about.

419
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:21,791
- There's a secret hidden in their gestures.
- They are both servants.

420
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:23,791
She's the guard's daughter, Champa.

421
00:34:24,036 --> 00:34:25,356
And he's a deaf and dumb servant.

422
00:34:25,422 --> 00:34:28,869
Tell him, if I don't use sign
language how will I talk to him!

423
00:34:29,156 --> 00:34:31,215
Why didn't you tell me that before?

424
00:34:31,255 --> 00:34:32,338
Forget it.

425
00:34:32,525 --> 00:34:35,785
Mr. Rajesh is in the upstairs room.
Don't worry.

426
00:34:35,922 --> 00:34:39,244
Why will I worry?
I've been born to worry others.

427
00:34:39,284 --> 00:34:40,617
Don't quarrel.

428
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,452
Sorry, Miss Champa. Forgive me.

429
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,159
I made a mistake.

430
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:49,249
By the way, you are a nice girl.
I'll give you an advice.

431
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:52,119
Henceforth if you want to
talk to anybody using gestures..

432
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:54,244
Then do it with me.

433
00:34:54,327 --> 00:34:57,660
My name is Mr. Balram.
I'm staying in the adjacent room.

434
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:59,215
Get lost!

435
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:04,285
But I praise your hard work, doctor.

436
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:07,923
I've never heard that an
incurable disease like asthma..

437
00:35:07,964 --> 00:35:10,672
Can be treated
with just one injection.

438
00:35:11,356 --> 00:35:13,339
But great, you did it!

439
00:35:14,027 --> 00:35:17,506
I've achieved this
success because of you.

440
00:35:18,506 --> 00:35:22,881
I want that the patent
of your valuable cure..

441
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,661
Must be immediately registered.

442
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:25,872
I don't mind.

443
00:35:26,177 --> 00:35:29,672
But on the condition is that we'll
will be equal partners in the profit.

444
00:35:29,933 --> 00:35:31,922
Partner! You!

445
00:35:32,711 --> 00:35:35,646
You're my servant!
I give you a salary.

446
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:38,674
You give me a salary for
your treatment and well-being.

447
00:35:39,341 --> 00:35:40,424
Not for invention.

448
00:35:41,385 --> 00:35:44,181
Wow! What are you talking about!

449
00:35:44,777 --> 00:35:48,329
You think that I left such a nice
job for this salary and came here?

450
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:50,962
No. You are here because..

451
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,628
I have made you my estate's trustee.

452
00:35:54,222 --> 00:35:59,087
I've opened a big laboratory for
your experiments and splurged money.

453
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,962
What's the use of the
money and laboratory..

454
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:02,628
If I had not used my brain.

455
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,337
I knew that your dedication
and brain will work.

456
00:36:10,912 --> 00:36:13,962
It's good that I got hold
of the duplicate copy of the..

457
00:36:14,045 --> 00:36:15,853
Invention's formula in your absence.

458
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:18,587
You betrayed me!
You've crossed your limits!

459
00:36:19,128 --> 00:36:21,012
- Mind your language, doctor!
- For your best interest..

460
00:36:21,036 --> 00:36:23,065
Return the duplicate copy
of the invention's formula!

461
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:23,971
Otherwise what will you do?

462
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:25,795
It's about my life and death for me.

463
00:36:26,295 --> 00:36:27,962
I'll do anything for it.

464
00:37:20,222 --> 00:37:21,261
Where's Mr. Shrinath?

465
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:23,571
What? Tell me, what do you want?

466
00:37:23,612 --> 00:37:25,042
I have some work with him.
Where is he?

467
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:26,844
He must be in his room. Come.

468
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,802
Mr. Rajesh!

469
00:37:31,027 --> 00:37:32,325
Inspector Sinha!

470
00:37:32,807 --> 00:37:33,618
You! Here?

471
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:36,143
Mr. Shrinath has called
me here for his protection.

472
00:37:36,382 --> 00:37:37,867
Sorry, Mr. Rajesh.

473
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:40,117
I've come to interfere in your work.

474
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,409
- What do you mean?
- I've Mr. Shrinath's arrest warrant.

475
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:46,534
Sir's arrest - For what?

476
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:49,409
He's accused of murdering
Rai Bahadur Jankinath.

477
00:37:49,761 --> 00:37:50,575
Where's his room?

478
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:51,784
- Come!
- Quickly!

479
00:38:11,227 --> 00:38:13,811
Mr. Shrinath! Open the door!

480
00:38:14,683 --> 00:38:17,519
Look! You both go and
guard the backside of the room.

481
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:23,594
Mr. Shrinath! Open the door!

482
00:38:24,143 --> 00:38:27,102
What's going on?

483
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,948
Why have the police come?

484
00:38:30,081 --> 00:38:31,278
Mr. Shrinath!

485
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,110
I say open the door!

486
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,527
There's no answer.
I think we'll have to break the door.

487
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:39,792
As you say.

488
00:38:39,895 --> 00:38:41,058
- Look!
- Wait.

489
00:38:41,138 --> 00:38:42,527
I have the duplicate key.

490
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:46,152
Give it.

491
00:38:51,249 --> 00:38:52,499
You all stay away!

492
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,580
Mr. Shrinath!

493
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,840
Don't try to attack!

494
00:39:05,894 --> 00:39:07,800
Surrender to the police.

495
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:24,154
Corpse!

496
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:28,708
Mr. Shrinath!

497
00:39:30,446 --> 00:39:32,784
- Sir!
- Switch on the lights!

498
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:35,275
My brother!

499
00:39:35,316 --> 00:39:37,524
You all stay outside.
You can't come inside.

500
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:39,107
Let me check him. I'm a doctor.

501
00:39:39,441 --> 00:39:40,941
We'll call you if we need you.

502
00:39:41,066 --> 00:39:43,316
- Constable, nobody should enter the room.
- Okay.

503
00:39:44,058 --> 00:39:46,524
You go out! Get out, you too!

504
00:40:15,782 --> 00:40:17,573
He was already facing
a threat to his life.

505
00:40:18,364 --> 00:40:22,949
- And he had told me that somebody wants to kill him.
- Who?

506
00:40:26,058 --> 00:40:28,753
The few words that
I had with him reveals..

507
00:40:28,951 --> 00:40:31,368
That he neither had any
enemies nor he doubted anybody.

508
00:40:32,675 --> 00:40:36,619
But I didn't know that
everything will happen so soon.

509
00:40:37,316 --> 00:40:41,577
I am dazed about where
the murderer came from?

510
00:40:42,346 --> 00:40:43,708
And where he went.

511
00:40:45,221 --> 00:40:46,221
Let it be.

512
00:40:47,408 --> 00:40:49,744
I'll not rest in peace
till the time I don't hand..

513
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,437
Over the culprit to the law.

514
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,262
I'm warning you all.

515
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,981
No person living in this bungalow..

516
00:41:02,022 --> 00:41:04,095
Can leave without
the police permission.

517
00:41:04,703 --> 00:41:06,637
It means you doubt us?

518
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,595
- I mean to say..
- It is possible that you all are innocent.

519
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:14,720
But it is the police's duty
to investigate the matter thoroughly.

520
00:41:15,479 --> 00:41:17,928
I'll come here tomorrow morning
to take everybody's statement.

521
00:41:18,387 --> 00:41:21,762
But before that,
post mortem of the body is important.

522
00:41:22,573 --> 00:41:25,095
Ram Singh!
Make arrangement to carry the corpse.

523
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:28,393
You all can leave.
I will shut this door.

524
00:41:28,721 --> 00:41:29,721
Inspector Sinha!

525
00:41:36,012 --> 00:41:38,137
- Don't lock the door.
- Why?

526
00:41:38,801 --> 00:41:41,512
It's possible that the
murderer has left behind a clue.

527
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:45,512
- And he will come here again to erase that.
- Well, not a bad idea.

528
00:41:46,834 --> 00:41:48,387
- Fine, Mr. Rajesh.
- Okay.

529
00:42:36,985 --> 00:42:38,089
Who is it!

530
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:40,381
You!

531
00:42:43,396 --> 00:42:45,851
What is the meaning
of you being present here?

532
00:42:46,351 --> 00:42:48,934
To gain the thing
that you have stolen.

533
00:42:50,131 --> 00:42:53,548
Before you are accused of
hiding in a young girl's room..

534
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:55,646
Quietly, leave this place.

535
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:00,478
Thanks for the advice.

536
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:07,353
But stealing from the room
where a murder has been committed..

537
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,170
Is not just a crime
but it amounts to two crimes.

538
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:12,353
Come on. Give me.

539
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:15,478
But what will you do with this?

540
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:18,103
How can I say without
knowing what it is?

541
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:22,936
What if it's an ordinary thing?

542
00:43:23,984 --> 00:43:27,192
So ordinary that you had
come to seek my help in stealing it.

543
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:30,817
And now putting your own
life into danger, you've stolen it.

544
00:43:32,499 --> 00:43:36,817
At times, what's ordinary for
one could be lifesaving for the other.

545
00:43:37,238 --> 00:43:39,872
And it also takes life.
And it happened today.

546
00:43:40,045 --> 00:43:43,338
Believe me, this thing has no..

547
00:43:43,379 --> 00:43:45,541
Connection to Mr. Shrinath's murder!

548
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,622
I will believe that when
I know what has been stolen.

549
00:43:50,402 --> 00:43:52,955
So look.

550
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:00,898
Will!

551
00:44:03,221 --> 00:44:06,096
- Jogeshwar Prasad!
- He was Mr. Shrinath's father.

552
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:10,549
It means you know this family closely.

553
00:44:12,002 --> 00:44:14,705
Then the police will get sufficient
help in nabbing the killer..

554
00:44:14,942 --> 00:44:17,242
- With the aid of your statement.
- No, no!

555
00:44:17,475 --> 00:44:19,076
I won't give any
statement to the police!

556
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,201
But don't consider me as the culprit!

557
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:24,701
I'll you tell you everything.

558
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:26,617
Thanks. Sit.

559
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:35,617
Mr. Jogeshwar was a big landlord.

560
00:44:36,428 --> 00:44:37,826
He had three sons.

561
00:44:38,163 --> 00:44:41,034
Dinanath, Shrinath and Pitambar.

562
00:44:42,193 --> 00:44:43,784
Dinanath was a principled man.

563
00:44:44,321 --> 00:44:46,821
So he opposed the atrocities
undertaken by the landlords.

564
00:44:47,873 --> 00:44:50,165
Pitambar got married
to the girl of his choice.

565
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:54,866
Using this opportunity,
Shrinath instigated Mr. Jogeshwar..

566
00:44:55,785 --> 00:44:57,540
To banish both of them.

567
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,415
And he made Shrinath the sole heir.

568
00:45:01,494 --> 00:45:06,326
Before coming here, what
Dinanath went through nobody knows.

569
00:45:07,236 --> 00:45:12,278
Pitambar left his wife and
a small child behind and disappeared.

570
00:45:12,826 --> 00:45:14,653
There's still no news about him.

571
00:45:15,782 --> 00:45:21,028
Twice his wife came to seek Mr.
Jogeshwar's help.

572
00:45:21,665 --> 00:45:23,861
But Shrinath didn't
even let her meet him.

573
00:45:25,493 --> 00:45:30,653
And after some time.. she died.

574
00:45:32,767 --> 00:45:36,601
Mr. Jogeshwar always used to be sick.
When he found out everything..

575
00:45:36,974 --> 00:45:40,267
He made a new will before dying.

576
00:45:40,891 --> 00:45:44,101
He divided everything equally
between Dinanath and Pitambar..

577
00:45:44,184 --> 00:45:45,976
And he disinherited Shrinath.

578
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:50,140
It's a coincidence that
you got a job at the place..

579
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:52,809
From where you wanted
to steal this will.

580
00:45:53,892 --> 00:45:57,267
- I want to ask you something.
- Yes.

581
00:45:57,347 --> 00:45:59,764
- Where is Mr. Pitambar's daughter?
- What?

582
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:01,351
Who?

583
00:46:29,442 --> 00:46:31,275
What happened? Who was that?

584
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:32,945
I am wondering the same thing.

585
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,336
If there was somebody,
where did he disappear?

586
00:46:35,518 --> 00:46:37,924
There was somebody.
I even followed him.

587
00:46:38,214 --> 00:46:41,127
- But when I reached here, I saw he had disappeared.
- Strange!

588
00:46:42,315 --> 00:46:44,836
I want to meet all the people
living in this bungalow right now.

589
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:47,336
Come, I'll show you the way. Come.

590
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:50,844
This is Mr. Dinanath's room.

591
00:46:54,401 --> 00:46:57,344
Mr. Dinanath!

592
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,885
What's happening in this house?
He's fast asleep!

593
00:47:04,248 --> 00:47:05,248
Mr. Dinanath!

594
00:47:05,643 --> 00:47:08,052
- Who is it?
- It's me! Rajesh.

595
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:09,270
Open the door.

596
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,542
I am sorry for troubling you.

597
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,917
It's okay. Tell me.

598
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:20,292
- Did you see anybody passing by the window?
- Window?

599
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:22,417
I was asleep.

600
00:47:23,589 --> 00:47:28,708
I don't know when I fell
asleep thinking about Shrinath.

601
00:47:29,964 --> 00:47:31,958
What's the matter? Who was it?

602
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,167
I don't know. But somebody was there.

603
00:47:34,612 --> 00:47:37,417
- He had worn a black blanket.
- Black blanket?

604
00:47:37,682 --> 00:47:40,167
Yes. He ran away when he heard me.

605
00:47:40,776 --> 00:47:41,791
I even followed him.

606
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:45,833
But when I reached the east
wing balcony, I saw nobody there.

607
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:48,082
Oh God!

608
00:47:48,925 --> 00:47:52,875
A man has turned evil!

609
00:47:53,518 --> 00:47:56,250
It's a dangerous thing!

610
00:47:56,581 --> 00:47:59,042
- Now what will happen?
- Don't worry.

611
00:47:59,249 --> 00:48:00,833
I had only come to warn you.

612
00:48:03,253 --> 00:48:05,553
But whom to be careful about?

613
00:48:05,862 --> 00:48:08,307
You don't worry.
We will handle what happens.

614
00:48:08,687 --> 00:48:10,890
- I will find out.
- Surely.

615
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:26,682
Constable!

616
00:48:27,432 --> 00:48:30,046
- Yes, sir!
- Did you see anybody entering the bungalow?

617
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,005
- No, sir.
- Did anybody leave from here?

618
00:48:32,128 --> 00:48:33,130
No, sir.

619
00:48:33,638 --> 00:48:34,721
Fine, go.

620
00:48:35,674 --> 00:48:36,674
Come with me.

621
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:54,214
You're still awake? Couldn't sleep?

622
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:56,388
How can I sleep today?

623
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,158
The sorrow of sir's departure..

624
00:48:58,238 --> 00:49:00,828
Manager, Mr. Rajesh wants to know..

625
00:49:00,876 --> 00:49:04,368
If have you seen any strange
incident in this bungalow?

626
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:06,733
What incident could
be greater than this?

627
00:49:06,817 --> 00:49:08,192
That sir has been murdered!

628
00:49:08,344 --> 00:49:12,442
No, no! We mean to say ghosts.

629
00:49:12,522 --> 00:49:14,339
- Ghosts!
- Yes.

630
00:49:14,905 --> 00:49:17,983
This bungalow is also
known as a haunted house.

631
00:49:18,984 --> 00:49:22,733
- But many years ago, once..
- What did you see many years ago?

632
00:49:23,484 --> 00:49:26,695
A strange sight!

633
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,820
I saw an apparition and
it disappeared in a jiffy.

634
00:49:30,237 --> 00:49:31,903
Who used to reside
here during that time?

635
00:49:32,351 --> 00:49:36,601
Sir, I and besides the doctor,
all the servants.

636
00:49:36,878 --> 00:49:40,434
Doctor was there too? Yes, during
that time, the doctor was here too.

637
00:49:41,425 --> 00:49:43,101
Fine. Now you can rest.

638
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:44,870
Let's go, Ms. Shobha.

639
00:49:54,097 --> 00:49:56,359
I'm Rajesh. Please open the door.

640
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:04,287
Sorry for troubling you at this hour.

641
00:50:04,624 --> 00:50:05,707
I had some work with you.

642
00:50:07,063 --> 00:50:08,147
Come in.

643
00:50:09,447 --> 00:50:11,695
It's so late in the night.
You are still awake.

644
00:50:11,956 --> 00:50:12,962
You can see that.

645
00:50:13,393 --> 00:50:14,599
Is this all you wanted to know..

646
00:50:14,623 --> 00:50:16,553
Or did you want
to search the place too?

647
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:20,274
You're misunderstanding me.
I had a bad headache.

648
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:23,021
So I thought you might
give me some medicine.

649
00:50:24,808 --> 00:50:26,876
Headache and stomach
ache occurs willingly.

650
00:50:28,073 --> 00:50:30,036
Doctors have to find out the truth.

651
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:34,204
I'll give you this medicine.
Have it with water.

652
00:50:34,768 --> 00:50:36,737
- Thank you.
- If you have headache, it will be alleviated.

653
00:50:36,761 --> 00:50:39,241
And even if you don't have one,
there won't be any side effect.

654
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:40,792
You also want it?

655
00:50:41,695 --> 00:50:43,367
Me? Why me?

656
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:46,112
At times the patient's
sympathisers too fall ill.

657
00:50:47,284 --> 00:50:50,943
And you got the news of
his aliment before the doctor.

658
00:50:51,043 --> 00:50:54,261
You're wrong. I didn't know your room.

659
00:50:54,668 --> 00:50:56,868
- So she..
- No need for any justifications, Mr. Rajesh.

660
00:50:57,196 --> 00:50:58,279
Goodnight.

661
00:51:11,116 --> 00:51:13,466
So you didn't see or hear anybody?

662
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:15,560
Sir, I was sleeping.

663
00:51:15,848 --> 00:51:17,973
- So..
- People in this house are strange!

664
00:51:18,224 --> 00:51:20,231
- Boss has been murdered and everybody's resting!
- Sorry.

665
00:51:20,255 --> 00:51:22,299
But there is no rest, sir!

666
00:51:22,523 --> 00:51:25,919
This deaf and dumb
man snores the whole night.

667
00:51:26,022 --> 00:51:29,981
Yes, sir. This dumb man snores a lot.

668
00:51:31,614 --> 00:51:33,518
Do you understand? He's abusing!

669
00:51:33,685 --> 00:51:35,518
- Abusing?
- Not you, me!

670
00:51:36,106 --> 00:51:38,408
- You understand his language?
- I am trying.

671
00:51:38,755 --> 00:51:39,755
Fool!

672
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,976
What will you understand?
Go to sleep! Go.

673
00:51:47,926 --> 00:51:49,846
- You too go to sleep, old man.
- What about you?

674
00:51:49,893 --> 00:51:52,351
His snores won't let me sleep!

675
00:51:56,574 --> 00:52:00,150
We met everybody. But we
didn't find anything suspicious.

676
00:52:00,612 --> 00:52:02,348
- I did.
- Where?

677
00:52:02,684 --> 00:52:04,298
- Everywhere.
- What do you mean?

678
00:52:05,675 --> 00:52:10,581
- Why are you so anxious to know?
- I'm not eager. But, I..

679
00:52:10,824 --> 00:52:11,742
We will find out in the morning..

680
00:52:11,783 --> 00:52:13,783
When the police will
take everybody's statement.

681
00:52:14,621 --> 00:52:16,619
But why are you telling me this?

682
00:52:17,355 --> 00:52:19,480
Because it's quite late.

683
00:52:19,714 --> 00:52:21,536
Now you go and rest. I'll leave.

684
00:52:21,851 --> 00:52:25,453
If you feel scared at night,
I'll stay here.

685
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:27,328
I can even guard your door.

686
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,495
Had I been such a coward
then it would have been..

687
00:52:32,536 --> 00:52:34,369
Difficult for me
to stay in this place.

688
00:52:34,643 --> 00:52:38,828
This is what I thought too.
You are very brave.

689
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,579
- Return it to me.
- What?

690
00:52:42,364 --> 00:52:44,988
This stolen stuff?

691
00:52:45,622 --> 00:52:47,598
- Yes.
- Let it remain with me.

692
00:52:47,879 --> 00:52:49,119
But what will you do with this?

693
00:52:49,629 --> 00:52:52,309
- Tomorrow morning, in front of the police..
- You want to frame me?

694
00:52:52,497 --> 00:52:54,264
I only want to help the police.

695
00:52:55,043 --> 00:52:56,043
Goodnight.

696
00:53:07,512 --> 00:53:10,775
Can you tell me whether Mr.
Shrinath had any enemies?

697
00:53:11,394 --> 00:53:13,734
He didn't have any enemies.

698
00:53:13,775 --> 00:53:15,817
- But..
- What?

699
00:53:16,616 --> 00:53:18,324
Nothing special.

700
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:24,145
When I came here at that time
Shrinath was threatening his manager.

701
00:53:24,871 --> 00:53:27,642
If he doesn't rectify the accounts..

702
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:30,005
Then he will land up in the prison.

703
00:53:34,735 --> 00:53:39,102
Last night, when I came how come
you had Mr. Shrinath's room's key?

704
00:53:41,457 --> 00:53:43,923
At times, sir would return home late.

705
00:53:44,153 --> 00:53:47,420
So he himself had
given me one set of keys.

706
00:53:49,917 --> 00:53:54,828
When was the last time
that you saw Mr. Shrinath alive?

707
00:53:56,973 --> 00:53:59,378
At the night of the murder
at around 11 o'clock..

708
00:53:59,754 --> 00:54:02,415
I heard somebody quarrelling
and I ran upstairs.

709
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:07,587
I saw the doctor leaving
sir's room in anger.

710
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:14,117
- So because of this you both had a fight?
- Yes.

711
00:54:14,472 --> 00:54:16,871
The person who had called you here,
he is dead.

712
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:17,973
Now, where will you go?

713
00:54:18,033 --> 00:54:19,553
The question of leaving doesn't arise.

714
00:54:19,629 --> 00:54:22,242
Because Shrinath has made
me the trustee of his estate.

715
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:26,309
Where are the documents
of the trusteeship?

716
00:54:26,653 --> 00:54:28,173
It must be lying
amongst his documents.

717
00:54:28,778 --> 00:54:30,408
Who do you think is the murderer?

718
00:54:30,672 --> 00:54:32,769
Law needs evidence, not conjecture.

719
00:54:33,828 --> 00:54:37,825
But when Shrinath has come,
I had heard both the brothers talking.

720
00:54:38,273 --> 00:54:40,533
It clearly revealed that
they shared a troubled relation.

721
00:54:45,273 --> 00:54:46,918
How long have you been working here?

722
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,918
It has been more than a month.

723
00:54:50,172 --> 00:54:52,793
But late Shrinath was fine.

724
00:54:53,258 --> 00:54:55,012
Still why didn't you leave?

725
00:54:56,708 --> 00:55:01,251
Because, I was not told to leave.

726
00:55:03,723 --> 00:55:04,723
You may go.

727
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:07,059
Wait!

728
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:11,043
Inspector Sinha, if you permit,
I would like to ask some questions.

729
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:12,741
Go ahead.

730
00:55:13,031 --> 00:55:16,459
Ms. Shobha where were you before Mr.
Shrinath was murdered?

731
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:18,819
In my room.

732
00:55:19,655 --> 00:55:21,668
- And after the murder?
- What?

733
00:55:22,288 --> 00:55:24,793
Yes. Where were you after
the murder was committed?

734
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:29,334
In my room. I was in my room.

735
00:55:32,366 --> 00:55:33,366
You may go.

736
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:41,866
I'm still in the dark about
this case as I was last night.

737
00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:45,601
Everybody is trying to blame somebody.

738
00:55:46,726 --> 00:55:51,351
You saw somebody last night.
Found out anything about that?

739
00:55:51,892 --> 00:55:55,976
No, not yet.
But I will be alert tonight.

740
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,934
I am sending my report
to the Superintendent of police.

741
00:56:00,647 --> 00:56:01,809
Will you come to the city?

742
00:56:02,476 --> 00:56:03,920
Yes. I'll have to go to the city too,
to find out..

743
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:06,517
About the identity of this nurse.
You go ahead.

744
00:56:06,638 --> 00:56:08,438
- I'll meet you at the police station.
- Okay.

745
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:14,210
- Can I come in?
- Come.

746
00:56:19,092 --> 00:56:21,502
You didn't say anything
against me in front of the police.

747
00:56:22,684 --> 00:56:24,292
I want to thank you for that.

748
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:28,294
What is there to thank me?

749
00:56:29,694 --> 00:56:31,710
I did what I thought was right.

750
00:56:34,983 --> 00:56:36,002
You're going?

751
00:56:37,377 --> 00:56:39,835
You thought I had come here to stay?

752
00:56:42,044 --> 00:56:46,919
But it's not right to leave
such a big case unfinished.

753
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,145
Now the police are
going to handle this case.

754
00:56:49,169 --> 00:56:52,169
And the person for whose protection
I had come here he is dead.

755
00:56:52,636 --> 00:56:54,919
So why did you keep
a watch on me at night?

756
00:56:56,014 --> 00:56:57,931
Force of habit.

757
00:56:58,728 --> 00:57:04,353
Why don't you think it's necessary
to live here to finish that case?

758
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,556
Because it's beneficial
to you if I leave.

759
00:57:09,795 --> 00:57:11,617
- My benefit?
- Yes.

760
00:57:11,999 --> 00:57:14,700
If I left,
there won't be any hurdles for you.

761
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:17,367
And you can steal whatever you want.

762
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:19,492
Stop joking!

763
00:57:21,253 --> 00:57:25,617
Till we solve the mystery
of the black shadow, stay here.

764
00:57:26,715 --> 00:57:28,992
Why are you so interested in me?

765
00:57:29,694 --> 00:57:32,242
Interested in you.

766
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:36,158
I mean, I don't know.

767
00:57:36,428 --> 00:57:38,325
How much was Mr. Shrinath paying you?

768
00:57:39,053 --> 00:57:40,325
But, I..

769
00:57:41,101 --> 00:57:45,700
I won't refuse to
give you whatever I can.

770
00:57:46,456 --> 00:57:49,539
You know that I don't
work just for money.

771
00:57:52,163 --> 00:57:54,497
If you say, I will stay here.

772
00:57:55,101 --> 00:57:57,789
- As it is, I was not leaving.
- What?

773
00:57:58,539 --> 00:58:01,622
Yes. I was going to the
city regarding this case.

774
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:04,414
I'll return by evening. Bye.

775
00:58:08,358 --> 00:58:11,069
I forgot. Take your will.

776
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:13,022
Keep it carefully.

777
00:58:13,779 --> 00:58:17,111
I'll keep it. But what
if the black shadow comes back?

778
00:58:17,959 --> 00:58:19,694
I want him to come back.

779
00:58:19,902 --> 00:58:21,611
This is a bait to trap the victim.

780
00:58:21,819 --> 00:58:24,069
Meaning, you don't care about my life.

781
00:58:24,861 --> 00:58:27,277
I can even give my
own life to save your life.

782
00:58:28,111 --> 00:58:31,611
But we have to lay a
big trap for a big criminal.

783
00:58:32,584 --> 00:58:36,611
- You're very dangerous.
- I'm not but I have to be.

784
00:58:36,861 --> 00:58:37,944
I'll leave now.

785
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:44,988
- Did you call me, sir?
- Yes.

786
00:58:45,268 --> 00:58:47,526
Look, I am going out.
I'll return by nightfall.

787
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:49,519
- You keep a close watch.
- Pardon me!

788
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,534
In your absence I will work
so well that even you will be dazed.

789
00:58:52,575 --> 00:58:54,697
Fool! Keep a look-out!

790
00:58:54,815 --> 00:58:55,860
I do that.

791
00:59:04,517 --> 00:59:06,138
Miss Champa, here you are!

792
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,587
- I was searching everywhere for you.
- Why?

793
00:59:08,894 --> 00:59:10,140
What work do you have with me?

794
00:59:10,181 --> 00:59:12,994
- You see, my sir has gone to the city.
- Oh God!

795
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,540
It has gone to the city!
Then what is this?

796
00:59:16,277 --> 00:59:17,739
Not my brain!

797
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,100
My sir! My boss!

798
00:59:19,777 --> 00:59:20,820
Forget that!

799
00:59:20,964 --> 00:59:23,940
Champa, I don't know what
spell you have cast on me.

800
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,780
I'm telling the truth, Champa.

801
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,380
I've lost my slumber
ever since I saw you.

802
00:59:30,542 --> 00:59:31,780
What rubbish!

803
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,980
- What if somebody heard you?
- Who will hear us here?

804
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:37,501
And so what if somebody heard?

805
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:41,060
Boss has given me all the
power before leaving for the city.

806
00:59:41,534 --> 00:59:47,566
I can get your lover that
dumb man or anybody else hanged.

807
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:51,393
- Why are you bullying me?
- How can I bully you?

808
00:59:51,837 --> 00:59:54,873
I am your admirer, Ms.
Champa. I am crazy about you.

809
00:59:55,004 --> 00:59:56,673
You are my beloved.

810
01:00:12,653 --> 01:00:15,109
"There are two lovers."

811
01:00:15,636 --> 01:00:18,236
"There are two lovers."

812
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:21,188
"I and you."

813
01:00:21,252 --> 01:00:24,372
"And you too."

814
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,140
"There are two lovers."

815
01:00:27,428 --> 01:00:30,085
"There are two lovers."

816
01:00:30,413 --> 01:00:32,869
"I and you."

817
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:35,790
"And you too."

818
01:00:46,782 --> 01:00:48,668
"I know that you are kind."

819
01:00:48,709 --> 01:00:53,109
"I'm more innocent
and pretty than you."

820
01:00:53,189 --> 01:00:58,589
"Your eyes reveal that
your intentions are bad."

821
01:00:58,852 --> 01:01:00,493
"I know that you are kind."

822
01:01:00,665 --> 01:01:04,977
"I'm more innocent
and pretty than you."

823
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:10,309
"Your eyes reveal that
your intentions are bad."

824
01:01:10,704 --> 01:01:13,309
"I look innocent."

825
01:01:13,727 --> 01:01:16,109
"I look innocent."

826
01:01:16,813 --> 01:01:19,389
"I and you."

827
01:01:19,469 --> 01:01:22,309
"And you too."

828
01:01:22,709 --> 01:01:28,229
"There are two lovers."

829
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:33,509
- "I and you."
- "And you too."

830
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:47,079
"You too are great! I too am great!"

831
01:01:47,267 --> 01:01:49,627
"Then why to quarrel."

832
01:01:49,869 --> 01:01:53,189
"My eyes look at you."

833
01:01:53,269 --> 01:01:55,789
"I don't want anything else."

834
01:01:55,869 --> 01:01:59,109
"You too are great! I too am great!"

835
01:01:59,305 --> 01:02:01,589
"Then why to quarrel."

836
01:02:01,789 --> 01:02:04,821
"My eyes look at you."

837
01:02:04,915 --> 01:02:07,429
"I don't want anything else."

838
01:02:07,923 --> 01:02:13,509
"The man who looks at me."

839
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:16,343
"I and you."

840
01:02:16,548 --> 01:02:19,500
"And you too."

841
01:02:19,954 --> 01:02:25,766
"There are two lovers."

842
01:02:25,807 --> 01:02:28,367
"I and you."

843
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:31,415
"And you too."

844
01:02:42,109 --> 01:02:48,477
"My eyes have weaved many dreams."

845
01:02:48,518 --> 01:02:53,609
"Forget that, fool.
Come back to reality."

846
01:02:54,015 --> 01:03:00,057
"My eyes have weaved many dreams."

847
01:03:00,314 --> 01:03:05,481
"Forget that, fool.
Come back to reality."

848
01:03:05,892 --> 01:03:08,581
"It will take care of love."

849
01:03:08,884 --> 01:03:11,534
"It will take care of love."

850
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:14,399
"I and you."

851
01:03:14,471 --> 01:03:17,192
"And you too."

852
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:20,326
"There are two lovers."

853
01:03:20,628 --> 01:03:23,286
"There are two lovers."

854
01:03:23,587 --> 01:03:26,087
"I and you."

855
01:03:26,183 --> 01:03:28,423
"And you too."

856
01:03:28,682 --> 01:03:29,846
"And you too."

857
01:03:29,887 --> 01:03:32,767
- "And you too."
- "And you too."

858
01:03:32,808 --> 01:03:35,128
- "And you too."
- "And you too."

859
01:03:35,406 --> 01:03:39,125
If you had not found the
other will of Mr. Jogeshwar..

860
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:43,585
Then it would have been difficult
for us to know that Shrinath..

861
01:03:44,322 --> 01:03:49,078
Murdered Rai Bahadur
for this real will, Mr. Rajesh.

862
01:03:51,108 --> 01:03:52,486
Now, there is no doubt in this.

863
01:03:52,999 --> 01:03:54,828
That faking false danger..

864
01:03:55,326 --> 01:03:56,900
It was his ruse to call me..

865
01:03:56,941 --> 01:03:58,661
To Jeetpur in order
to escape the police.

866
01:03:58,827 --> 01:03:59,846
You are right!

867
01:04:01,147 --> 01:04:04,035
But the amazing thing
is that the fake danger..

868
01:04:04,076 --> 01:04:05,686
Turned out to be real for him.

869
01:04:06,806 --> 01:04:10,166
And he was murdered before
you could reach there.

870
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:12,206
And in spite of your
being present in the villa.

871
01:04:12,446 --> 01:04:13,526
This is amazing!

872
01:04:14,612 --> 01:04:19,726
I can think of only one thing.
No matter, what is the reason?

873
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,366
A person living in the
villa has committed the murder.

874
01:04:23,069 --> 01:04:28,071
Doctor, manager,
Dinanath or else the nurse.

875
01:04:28,151 --> 01:04:29,578
- Nurse!
- Yes.

876
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,126
Inspector Sinha, you are forgetting.

877
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:35,618
The force with which he was stabbed..

878
01:04:35,845 --> 01:04:37,766
That weak girl was
not capable of doing that.

879
01:04:38,439 --> 01:04:40,528
If this is so, then we
can even erase old and crippled..

880
01:04:40,552 --> 01:04:42,312
Dinanath's name from
the list of suspects.

881
01:04:42,623 --> 01:04:46,766
Fine. But how can you say
that the culprit lives in that house?

882
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,801
It's possible that some
outsider has committed the murder.

883
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,126
- Outsider?
- Yes.

884
01:04:53,034 --> 01:04:56,686
Nobody knows anything about
the youngest brother Pitambar.

885
01:04:58,330 --> 01:05:03,206
It's possible that to gain the wealth,
under a disguise..

886
01:05:03,573 --> 01:05:06,526
It means everybody is a suspect.

887
01:05:07,049 --> 01:05:08,946
And we don't have
evidence against anybody.

888
01:05:09,026 --> 01:05:12,286
Inspector Sinha, tell me.
Where to begin the work from?

889
01:05:13,572 --> 01:05:14,642
What do you think?

890
01:05:14,885 --> 01:05:17,722
I think we should begin
the work with this handkerchief.

891
01:05:17,763 --> 01:05:19,094
- You mean, Lily?
- Yes.

892
01:05:19,402 --> 01:05:21,162
She is declining everything.

893
01:05:21,203 --> 01:05:22,723
But she'll have to accept it.

894
01:05:23,042 --> 01:05:26,362
Because besides her, we don't
have any other means to proceed.

895
01:05:26,482 --> 01:05:28,642
If this is the case,
then we should arrest her.

896
01:05:28,931 --> 01:05:34,692
No. I think till the time I don't
reach any conclusion about Lily..

897
01:05:35,011 --> 01:05:37,122
The police needs to hold off.

898
01:05:37,407 --> 01:05:39,522
Because it's about a girl.

899
01:05:39,563 --> 01:05:43,163
No. Because it's about the murderer.

900
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:15,886
"It's a serious matter."

901
01:06:15,927 --> 01:06:18,555
"Otherwise why would you come here?"

902
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:21,478
"It's a serious matter."

903
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:24,199
"Otherwise why would you come here?"

904
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:27,246
"Why are you nervous?"

905
01:06:27,568 --> 01:06:30,006
"Why are you ashamed?"

906
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,846
"Why are you nervous?"

907
01:06:33,115 --> 01:06:35,691
"Why are you ashamed?"

908
01:06:36,086 --> 01:06:38,446
"You have come amidst the poor."

909
01:06:38,825 --> 01:06:41,286
"You were so proud."

910
01:06:41,396 --> 01:06:44,006
"It's a serious matter."

911
01:06:44,286 --> 01:06:46,886
"Otherwise why would you come here?"

912
01:06:46,982 --> 01:06:49,693
"It's a serious matter."

913
01:06:49,846 --> 01:06:52,566
"Otherwise why would you come here?"

914
01:07:19,806 --> 01:07:22,566
"I do something and I say something."

915
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,134
"I was never like this before."

916
01:07:25,312 --> 01:07:28,112
"I do something and I say something."

917
01:07:28,406 --> 01:07:30,686
"I was never like this before."

918
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:33,638
"Yes, it was you!"

919
01:07:33,747 --> 01:07:36,247
"In the trance of love."

920
01:07:36,364 --> 01:07:38,959
"It's a serious matter."

921
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:41,686
"Otherwise why would you come here?"

922
01:07:41,832 --> 01:07:44,526
"It's a serious matter."

923
01:07:44,645 --> 01:07:47,351
"Otherwise why would you come here?"

924
01:08:09,332 --> 01:08:12,070
"Somebody wins. Somebody loses."

925
01:08:12,269 --> 01:08:14,669
"This is how the world is."

926
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:17,528
"Somebody wins. Somebody loses."

927
01:08:17,787 --> 01:08:20,215
"This is how the world is."

928
01:08:20,559 --> 01:08:25,894
"Why are you sitting
so far away from me?"

929
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,335
"It's a serious matter."

930
01:08:28,706 --> 01:08:31,151
"Otherwise why would you come here?"

931
01:08:31,419 --> 01:08:33,999
"It's a serious matter."

932
01:08:34,144 --> 01:08:37,384
"Otherwise why would you come here?"

933
01:08:54,336 --> 01:08:55,976
- Thanks for the flowers.
- Okay.

934
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,500
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

935
01:09:11,669 --> 01:09:14,691
Who are you? How did you come in?

936
01:09:20,334 --> 01:09:21,414
Detective!

937
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:27,893
What is the reason
to hide in a woman's room?

938
01:09:28,983 --> 01:09:30,792
First sit and ask me to sit.

939
01:09:31,029 --> 01:09:32,428
Then you will know the meaning too.

940
01:09:32,452 --> 01:09:35,314
I don't have time to waste.
You can leave.

941
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:38,086
If I won't go then maybe
you will call the bouncer..

942
01:09:38,113 --> 01:09:39,433
Pyare, and throw me out.

943
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:42,514
- Cigarette please.
- No, thanks.

944
01:09:42,687 --> 01:09:44,674
But why have you come here?

945
01:09:45,827 --> 01:09:46,954
I've not come willingly.

946
01:09:47,214 --> 01:09:48,734
This handkerchief has brought me here.

947
01:09:48,826 --> 01:09:52,066
Handkerchief?
Whose handkerchief is this?

948
01:09:52,285 --> 01:09:53,554
Must be yours.

949
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:55,858
Yes! Thank you so much.

950
01:09:56,187 --> 01:10:00,912
Sorry. For the moment
I will keep it with me.

951
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:03,215
Why? What is my relation to you?

952
01:10:03,524 --> 01:10:07,306
Not you but I do have
a relation with you.

953
01:10:08,115 --> 01:10:09,202
And you too will form a bond with me..

954
01:10:09,226 --> 01:10:11,311
If you stayed with me for a few days.

955
01:10:11,451 --> 01:10:14,066
Shut up! How dare you say that!

956
01:10:15,182 --> 01:10:16,626
Why will I stay with you?

957
01:10:17,209 --> 01:10:21,506
You don't need to and
maybe you won't be interested.

958
01:10:22,695 --> 01:10:24,466
That leaves the option
of helplessness.

959
01:10:25,295 --> 01:10:28,785
So you will be helpless to
listen to me because the man whom..

960
01:10:29,311 --> 01:10:33,862
You gave this handkerchief,
he was accused of murder.

961
01:10:36,406 --> 01:10:40,425
Don't worry.
I do everything with love.

962
01:10:40,585 --> 01:10:42,025
But what do you want?

963
01:10:42,172 --> 01:10:44,345
I want you to come
with me to Jeetpur..

964
01:10:44,694 --> 01:10:46,421
And live at Mr.
Shrinath's house for a few days.

965
01:10:46,445 --> 01:10:49,635
Why should I go there?
I don't know anything.

966
01:10:49,726 --> 01:10:51,825
I will find out what you don't know.

967
01:10:52,694 --> 01:10:55,305
By the way, it's every person's
duty to cooperate with law.

968
01:10:55,929 --> 01:11:00,145
So it's better that
you cooperate with me.

969
01:11:00,585 --> 01:11:03,185
Because the police have
handed this case to me.

970
01:11:03,874 --> 01:11:04,954
I see!

971
01:11:06,085 --> 01:11:08,185
If this is the case,
then I will come with you.

972
01:11:09,523 --> 01:11:14,465
But please sit for a couple
of minutes. I'll get ready and come.

973
01:11:25,148 --> 01:11:27,185
Till then,
you can glance through the magazine.

974
01:12:14,671 --> 01:12:18,149
- Ma'am, not there! From here!
- Yes!

975
01:12:19,949 --> 01:12:22,709
But why do you want to take me there?

976
01:12:22,789 --> 01:12:23,909
Don't worry.

977
01:12:24,229 --> 01:12:28,152
I just want to know that
the way you knew Mr. Shrinath..

978
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:32,309
Rai Bahadur, maybe you
know one of his other friends too.

979
01:12:32,469 --> 01:12:34,109
I don't know anybody.

980
01:12:34,509 --> 01:12:35,629
No problem.

981
01:12:35,749 --> 01:12:38,189
Maybe on reaching there,
you will know somebody else too.

982
01:12:38,747 --> 01:12:39,909
Let's go!

983
01:12:58,878 --> 01:12:59,878
What happened?

984
01:13:00,265 --> 01:13:01,273
Why are you screaming?

985
01:13:01,483 --> 01:13:02,483
Answer me!

986
01:13:05,195 --> 01:13:06,195
God!

987
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,632
- Ghost!
- Why are you both screaming?

988
01:13:09,163 --> 01:13:11,367
Take your hands off!
Maintain distance.

989
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:12,527
What happened?

990
01:13:12,607 --> 01:13:15,047
- There's a ghost.
- Ghost!

991
01:13:20,527 --> 01:13:21,780
Don't try to run away.

992
01:13:21,866 --> 01:13:23,266
The police are guarding this place.

993
01:13:27,671 --> 01:13:29,784
Sir, come quickly!

994
01:13:30,259 --> 01:13:32,593
What happened?
Why are you all screaming so much?

995
01:13:32,663 --> 01:13:35,727
Sir, there is something
behind the curtain.

996
01:13:42,589 --> 01:13:45,277
Stupid! Is this why
you all are making chaos!

997
01:13:45,489 --> 01:13:48,417
- And he scared me!
- Fool!

998
01:13:50,138 --> 01:13:51,937
Fool! Dumb and deaf!

999
01:13:52,067 --> 01:13:53,257
You got scared unnecessarily!

1000
01:13:54,364 --> 01:13:55,419
Keep quiet!

1001
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:58,431
Okay. I understood! Fine.

1002
01:13:59,005 --> 01:14:00,511
What are you talking about with him?

1003
01:14:01,177 --> 01:14:06,685
Is it your order that I
should talk to everybody loudly?

1004
01:14:06,794 --> 01:14:08,208
No, I mean..

1005
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:10,111
I understand your meaning well.

1006
01:14:10,325 --> 01:14:12,311
Thank God! You understood my meaning.

1007
01:14:12,677 --> 01:14:13,677
Shut up!

1008
01:14:16,257 --> 01:14:17,257
Listen!

1009
01:14:20,288 --> 01:14:21,932
How come you know her so well?

1010
01:14:22,192 --> 01:14:24,332
What? Me?

1011
01:14:25,143 --> 01:14:27,551
She has come here
a few times with sir.

1012
01:14:29,295 --> 01:14:31,031
- What was she saying?
- Nothing.

1013
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:32,430
Nothing?

1014
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:35,431
She was asking whether the
dance records are at home or not.

1015
01:14:37,866 --> 01:14:40,311
- Arrange for her accommodation.
- Fine.

1016
01:14:45,488 --> 01:14:47,088
- Did you call me, sir?
- Yes.

1017
01:14:48,088 --> 01:14:50,888
- What did you do the whole day?
- I did so many things, sir.

1018
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:54,772
So many things? I just
told you to keep a tab on people.

1019
01:14:54,874 --> 01:14:56,123
I kept a watch on them too, sir.

1020
01:14:56,147 --> 01:14:59,248
- What did you find out?
- Nothing as of now.

1021
01:14:59,413 --> 01:15:02,448
But if you and Champa's father
agree then something could happen.

1022
01:15:02,688 --> 01:15:03,625
What can happen?

1023
01:15:03,705 --> 01:15:08,448
- Actually, my marriage with Champa.
- Keep quiet!

1024
01:15:08,739 --> 01:15:10,064
If you continue behaving like this..

1025
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:12,193
Then how will I hand
over any responsible task to you?

1026
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:15,648
Sir! You didn't marry. That
doesn't mean I too shouldn't marry.

1027
01:15:15,896 --> 01:15:17,168
Shameless!

1028
01:15:17,605 --> 01:15:20,877
Now, henceforth,
I will do whatever you say.

1029
01:15:21,677 --> 01:15:24,524
Look, keep a close
watch on the ma'am..

1030
01:15:24,783 --> 01:15:26,477
Who has come with me from the city.

1031
01:15:26,805 --> 01:15:30,132
You don't worry!
I will keep a watch on her, sir.

1032
01:15:30,173 --> 01:15:34,249
Without blinking. But, sir,
what if I cast an evil eye on her?

1033
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:36,091
Again you are being insolent! Go!

1034
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:54,370
Ma'am will read at the balcony.

1035
01:15:55,857 --> 01:15:57,137
In her hand..

1036
01:16:00,977 --> 01:16:05,290
In her left hand, a book..

1037
01:16:09,876 --> 01:16:11,118
She went inside!

1038
01:17:38,049 --> 01:17:40,580
- Mr. Rajesh!
- What happened, Miss Shobha?

1039
01:17:44,137 --> 01:17:45,860
- Mr. Rajesh!
- What happened?

1040
01:17:46,613 --> 01:17:47,853
- The black shadow man!
- Where?

1041
01:17:47,933 --> 01:17:49,194
- In my room!
- Let's go!

1042
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:07,926
What happened?

1043
01:18:09,029 --> 01:18:10,429
Again he escaped!

1044
01:18:10,524 --> 01:18:11,764
There is no way here.

1045
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:13,862
- Where did he disappear?
- Why were the bullets fired?

1046
01:18:13,886 --> 01:18:16,486
- The black shadow man again disappeared.
- What happened?

1047
01:18:16,732 --> 01:18:18,292
I'm sure there is
a secret passage here.

1048
01:18:18,614 --> 01:18:21,611
Else a man can't vanish
into the thin air.

1049
01:18:30,261 --> 01:18:32,116
Mr. Dinanath,
do you know of any secret path..

1050
01:18:32,157 --> 01:18:34,077
In this part of the house?

1051
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:39,637
I'm like a stranger in this house.

1052
01:18:39,951 --> 01:18:42,397
Sir had made many
changes in this bungalow.

1053
01:18:42,523 --> 01:18:45,083
Then you must know which
place has been renovated.

1054
01:18:45,201 --> 01:18:47,501
But this happened before
I started working here.

1055
01:18:47,779 --> 01:18:50,197
Maybe, the doctor..

1056
01:18:50,422 --> 01:18:51,570
How will I know?

1057
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:53,757
I had been brought here
for a scientific research..

1058
01:18:54,003 --> 01:18:55,637
And not to investigate the house.

1059
01:18:56,436 --> 01:19:03,450
But you are the estate's trustee
and you are the manager, you both..

1060
01:19:03,491 --> 01:19:05,052
Should know something.

1061
01:19:05,444 --> 01:19:09,476
Look, if you people force the
detective to doubt the wrong man..

1062
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:11,587
Then he will be misguided.

1063
01:19:12,284 --> 01:19:13,364
No matter what.

1064
01:19:13,524 --> 01:19:18,644
Someday detective Mr.
Rajesh will surely solve the mystery.

1065
01:19:19,444 --> 01:19:23,364
I'm trying. You guys rest now.

1066
01:19:23,704 --> 01:19:26,164
Who can rest in this house now?

1067
01:19:32,915 --> 01:19:35,385
The strange thing is that
today the black shadow man..

1068
01:19:35,426 --> 01:19:37,186
Disappeared again
from the same place.

1069
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:38,804
And I couldn't nab him.

1070
01:19:39,594 --> 01:19:41,404
He has fooled you well.

1071
01:19:41,959 --> 01:19:45,364
Wait and watch whether he's
fooled only me or somebody else too.

1072
01:19:45,895 --> 01:19:48,004
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1073
01:19:53,477 --> 01:19:56,402
Mr. Rajesh!

1074
01:19:56,638 --> 01:19:58,004
What happened, Miss Shobha?

1075
01:19:59,314 --> 01:20:03,084
- What happened now?
- I went to call you and the will disappeared.

1076
01:20:04,462 --> 01:20:07,862
Good! You can't keep
stolen things for long.

1077
01:20:08,697 --> 01:20:10,061
You seem to be very happy.

1078
01:20:10,102 --> 01:20:12,302
Happy? Not at all.
In fact I regret it.

1079
01:20:12,618 --> 01:20:15,742
I thought I'll get
the chance to arrest him.

1080
01:20:15,862 --> 01:20:18,750
You didn't get the
chance and I again lost it.

1081
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:22,302
Do you know how important
that will was for me?

1082
01:20:25,985 --> 01:20:28,865
Even eyes don't stay on your face.

1083
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,172
- What?
- Nothing.

1084
01:20:33,635 --> 01:20:36,373
You look prettier when
you are angry and worried.

1085
01:20:37,676 --> 01:20:39,956
Somebody's in trouble.
And somebody's happy.

1086
01:20:39,997 --> 01:20:41,317
Forget it!

1087
01:20:41,484 --> 01:20:44,244
Why do you feel so dejected
for an ordinary document?

1088
01:20:44,362 --> 01:20:46,383
For you, it was an ordinary document.
But for me

1089
01:20:48,597 --> 01:20:49,783
Why are you upset?

1090
01:20:52,362 --> 01:20:56,703
The documents that the
man mugged were ordinary papers.

1091
01:20:58,263 --> 01:21:00,223
The police have your will.

1092
01:21:00,703 --> 01:21:02,184
And the government lawyer..

1093
01:21:02,264 --> 01:21:05,703
Will come here tomorrow
and state its authenticity.

1094
01:21:06,014 --> 01:21:09,743
This is the case!
Why didn't you tell me before?

1095
01:21:10,314 --> 01:21:13,415
You should not state anything
before its correct time.

1096
01:21:14,393 --> 01:21:19,983
- Like the feelings that I have for you.
- What?

1097
01:21:20,795 --> 01:21:22,063
There are some.

1098
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:25,023
But how can I express
it before the correct time?

1099
01:21:25,423 --> 01:21:30,660
Then go! Even I won't
express my feelings for you!

1100
01:21:36,353 --> 01:21:40,423
At least, I know that
you have some feelings for me.

1101
01:21:42,411 --> 01:21:44,983
Where are you going
so late in the night?

1102
01:21:45,407 --> 01:21:46,623
Won't you rest?

1103
01:21:46,703 --> 01:21:49,866
If I rest,
who will look after you all?

1104
01:21:50,153 --> 01:21:52,303
- I'm going downstairs.
- Shall I also come?

1105
01:21:52,383 --> 01:21:54,583
Why? Do you feel scared alone?

1106
01:21:56,521 --> 01:21:57,983
Then come.

1107
01:22:07,873 --> 01:22:09,444
It's such a nice place.

1108
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:12,901
But there are too many mosquitoes.

1109
01:22:16,318 --> 01:22:22,787
Its co-incidence or else, you and I..

1110
01:22:24,256 --> 01:22:25,427
How we met?

1111
01:22:27,267 --> 01:22:29,347
And how we got into
this complex situation.

1112
01:22:34,224 --> 01:22:36,107
- And now..
- What?

1113
01:22:41,951 --> 01:22:44,867
Though I am far,
still I am so close to you.

1114
01:22:46,107 --> 01:22:47,987
And though I am far,
but still, we are close.

1115
01:22:48,886 --> 01:22:50,067
Don't say that!

1116
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:01,458
I think the black shadow
man is going towards Lily's room.

1117
01:23:02,385 --> 01:23:04,427
I'm going there. You go upstairs.

1118
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:27,459
- Who is there?
- It's me, Rajesh.

1119
01:23:31,348 --> 01:23:32,655
Yes, detective.

1120
01:23:32,831 --> 01:23:35,018
- Who came here just now?
- Nobody.

1121
01:23:35,971 --> 01:23:38,227
But I saw the black shadow
man coming towards this room.

1122
01:23:38,268 --> 01:23:40,565
The black shadow man! My God!

1123
01:23:40,901 --> 01:23:42,698
Tell me the truth.
Where did that man go?

1124
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:46,836
- Believe me! I don't know!
- You are lying!

1125
01:24:10,177 --> 01:24:11,777
What are you doing here at this hour?

1126
01:24:12,473 --> 01:24:14,897
I couldn't sleep.
So I was taking a stroll.

1127
01:24:15,223 --> 01:24:18,177
- Did you see anybody here?
- No.

1128
01:24:23,598 --> 01:24:26,137
Why is the light on in the
doctor's room so late in the night?

1129
01:24:26,848 --> 01:24:30,097
What he does and when,
nobody knows that.

1130
01:24:40,364 --> 01:24:43,217
Doctor! Doctor!

1131
01:24:50,107 --> 01:24:52,434
Mr. Rajesh!

1132
01:24:55,414 --> 01:24:56,067
What happened?

1133
01:24:56,207 --> 01:24:57,793
The black shadow man! Come soon!

1134
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:04,714
Look!

1135
01:25:09,063 --> 01:25:11,776
Shobha, I'll go and
hide where the black..

1136
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:14,391
Shadow man always disappears.

1137
01:25:15,059 --> 01:25:17,222
Go to the hall and call me loudly.

1138
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,535
Hearing that the black
shadow man will come here.

1139
01:25:19,559 --> 01:25:20,702
And I will nab him.

1140
01:25:20,793 --> 01:25:21,902
- Hurry up!
- Okay!

1141
01:25:37,379 --> 01:25:41,215
Mr. Rajesh, come soon!
Black shadow man!

1142
01:27:28,342 --> 01:27:29,448
What has happened!

1143
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:34,448
What should I do now?!

1144
01:27:41,842 --> 01:27:42,842
You?

1145
01:27:43,217 --> 01:27:44,846
Move! Let me check him.

1146
01:27:49,342 --> 01:27:51,926
He has injured his head.
So, he is unconscious.

1147
01:27:53,944 --> 01:27:56,166
- Sir's mouth is bleeding.
- Don't talk rubbish!

1148
01:27:56,428 --> 01:27:57,606
Take him downstairs quickly.

1149
01:27:59,662 --> 01:28:02,942
Mr. Rajesh is a nice man.

1150
01:28:03,905 --> 01:28:08,280
Or else, who risks
his life for somebody else?

1151
01:28:08,352 --> 01:28:09,432
You are right.

1152
01:28:10,741 --> 01:28:13,742
You people can leave now.
Let him rest.

1153
01:28:14,942 --> 01:28:17,982
God willing he'll get well soon.

1154
01:28:19,304 --> 01:28:20,384
Let's go!

1155
01:28:26,413 --> 01:28:27,493
You leave too.

1156
01:28:27,604 --> 01:28:28,764
- Me too?
- Yes.

1157
01:28:47,255 --> 01:28:48,600
Are you giving him the injection?

1158
01:28:48,641 --> 01:28:50,815
- You can see that.
- But what is the need for that?

1159
01:28:50,856 --> 01:28:53,536
I know that better than you.

1160
01:28:53,779 --> 01:28:55,725
I won't let you give him injection.

1161
01:28:57,740 --> 01:29:02,159
- It means you don't trust me?
- I was..

1162
01:29:02,247 --> 01:29:04,934
I didn't know that you are
responsible for his well being.

1163
01:29:05,365 --> 01:29:06,854
Let it be. I am leaving.

1164
01:29:10,881 --> 01:29:12,694
When you start trusting me again..

1165
01:29:12,817 --> 01:29:15,685
And your patient needs me,
then call me.

1166
01:29:58,365 --> 01:30:02,854
What's this? Who drank the milk?

1167
01:30:07,115 --> 01:30:09,237
I see! So this is the matter!

1168
01:30:12,779 --> 01:30:15,557
How long will you
stay like this? Get up!

1169
01:30:16,802 --> 01:30:18,077
Get up!

1170
01:30:35,084 --> 01:30:36,495
Black shadow man!

1171
01:30:36,536 --> 01:30:37,731
What happened? Where?

1172
01:30:39,094 --> 01:30:40,614
You regained consciousness as soon..

1173
01:30:40,655 --> 01:30:42,499
As you heard about
the black shadow man!

1174
01:30:43,579 --> 01:30:44,965
So, you lie too.

1175
01:30:45,045 --> 01:30:49,259
Yes, you played a charade
to trouble everybody.

1176
01:30:50,334 --> 01:30:54,099
And I can't lie to expose
your fake unconsciousness?

1177
01:30:54,779 --> 01:30:56,685
I pretended to be
unconscious as I wanted..

1178
01:30:57,170 --> 01:30:58,939
To hear what others were saying.

1179
01:30:59,154 --> 01:31:02,099
What did you get by doing this?
What did you understood?

1180
01:31:02,499 --> 01:31:04,179
I know who the culprit is.

1181
01:31:07,021 --> 01:31:09,149
- Who is he?
- You.

1182
01:31:09,326 --> 01:31:12,939
- Me! What are you saying?
- I'm telling the truth.

1183
01:31:14,884 --> 01:31:19,699
Then handcuff me and
take me to the police station.

1184
01:31:20,111 --> 01:31:22,711
When you are ready, I won't leave you!

1185
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,832
No!

1186
01:31:25,330 --> 01:31:29,770
"If somebody saw,
they will call you crazy. No!"

1187
01:31:29,811 --> 01:31:31,090
"Leave my hand."

1188
01:31:31,142 --> 01:31:33,850
"Beloved, no, no, no."

1189
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:38,690
"If somebody saw,
they will call you crazy. No!"

1190
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:40,250
"Leave my hand."

1191
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:42,850
"Beloved, no, no, no."

1192
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:04,969
"Look, don't stare like this."

1193
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:09,530
"Let me go. Don't stop my way."

1194
01:32:10,198 --> 01:32:13,770
"Look, don't stare like this."

1195
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:18,330
"Let me go. Don't stop my way."

1196
01:32:19,474 --> 01:32:23,770
"It is midnight. Everybody is asleep."

1197
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:28,090
"And you are harassing me."

1198
01:32:28,314 --> 01:32:32,930
"I might die of shame."

1199
01:32:32,971 --> 01:32:34,450
"Leave my hand."

1200
01:32:34,509 --> 01:32:36,930
"Beloved, no, no, no."

1201
01:32:37,486 --> 01:32:41,930
"If somebody saw,
they will call you crazy. No!"

1202
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:43,530
"Leave my hand."

1203
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:46,170
"Beloved, no, no, no."

1204
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:56,450
"Beloved, listen. Don't use gestures."

1205
01:32:56,610 --> 01:33:01,010
"The moon and the stars
might look from the window."

1206
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:05,530
"Beloved, listen. Don't use gestures."

1207
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:10,010
"The moon and the stars
might look from the window."

1208
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:15,250
"It is midnight. Everybody is asleep."

1209
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:19,330
"And you are harassing me."

1210
01:33:19,708 --> 01:33:24,018
"Somebody might create
a story from this."

1211
01:33:24,237 --> 01:33:28,330
"Leave my hand. Beloved, no, no, no."

1212
01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:33,170
"If somebody saw,
they will call you crazy. No!"

1213
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:34,690
"Leave my hand."

1214
01:33:34,878 --> 01:33:37,770
"Beloved, no, no, no."

1215
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:50,450
"I will come again.
Beloved, I am your hostage."

1216
01:33:50,690 --> 01:33:55,010
"Your eyes are connected to my heart."

1217
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:59,330
"I will come again.
Beloved, I am your hostage."

1218
01:33:59,610 --> 01:34:03,930
"Your eyes are connected to my heart."

1219
01:34:04,909 --> 01:34:09,090
"It is midnight. Everybody is asleep."

1220
01:34:09,330 --> 01:34:13,450
"And you are harassing me."

1221
01:34:13,673 --> 01:34:16,450
"Don't be impatient.
We will meet tomorrow."

1222
01:34:16,491 --> 01:34:17,971
"Beloved, don't worry."

1223
01:34:18,201 --> 01:34:19,720
"Leave my hand."

1224
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:22,250
"Beloved, no, no, no."

1225
01:34:22,610 --> 01:34:27,090
"If somebody saw,
they will call you crazy."

1226
01:34:27,156 --> 01:34:28,516
"Leave my hand."

1227
01:34:28,779 --> 01:34:31,859
"Beloved, no, no, no."

1228
01:34:36,890 --> 01:34:39,050
This is that will of Mr.
Jogeshwar in which..

1229
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:44,369
He had disinherited his eldest
son Dinanath and youngest son..

1230
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:49,570
Pitambar and made his
other son Shrinath the sole heir.

1231
01:34:50,384 --> 01:34:53,304
But there is another will too.

1232
01:34:53,815 --> 01:34:56,174
In this, he had annulled
the previous will..

1233
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:59,188
And gave equal share
to Dinanath and Pitambar..

1234
01:34:59,597 --> 01:35:01,960
And had disinherited Shrinath.

1235
01:35:02,626 --> 01:35:07,606
Mr. Jogeshwar has made this
will a short while before dying..

1236
01:35:08,244 --> 01:35:11,465
In front of late
Rai Bahadur Jankinath.

1237
01:35:11,567 --> 01:35:12,567
I beg your pardon!

1238
01:35:12,682 --> 01:35:16,121
But what about me being
the trustee of the estate..

1239
01:35:16,162 --> 01:35:17,962
As per Mr. Shrinath's will?

1240
01:35:18,335 --> 01:35:20,994
As per Mr.
Jogeshwar's consequent will..

1241
01:35:21,493 --> 01:35:23,575
The first will
proves to be baseless.

1242
01:35:23,776 --> 01:35:26,989
So, Mr. Shrinath's will
that you have mentioned..

1243
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:28,470
That gets automatically annulled.

1244
01:35:28,830 --> 01:35:31,989
The will in which Mr.
Shrinath has been disinherited..

1245
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:34,190
That could have been forged.

1246
01:35:34,644 --> 01:35:37,779
What if I call this as Rai
Bahadur and the other brothers' ruse?

1247
01:35:38,002 --> 01:35:41,629
So you can file an appeal in
the court to prove that it is fake.

1248
01:35:41,763 --> 01:35:44,877
Mr. Dinanath, I congratulate you.

1249
01:35:45,344 --> 01:35:49,344
Now you are the sole heir of Mr.
Jogeshwar's inheritance.

1250
01:35:50,585 --> 01:35:52,145
Its God's divine play!

1251
01:35:52,577 --> 01:35:58,577
How God converts a King into
a pauper and a pauper into a King..

1252
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,360
Nobody knows.

1253
01:36:01,457 --> 01:36:05,577
I'm the sole heir of this vast estate.

1254
01:36:05,738 --> 01:36:06,882
Yes.

1255
01:36:07,378 --> 01:36:11,738
Because, the late Mr. Shrinath
had no children and he didn't marry.

1256
01:36:11,818 --> 01:36:13,738
But, lawyer, that's not true.

1257
01:36:17,136 --> 01:36:18,898
Pitambar's child exists.

1258
01:36:18,978 --> 01:36:20,138
Exists?

1259
01:36:20,276 --> 01:36:21,578
Who's it? Where's the child?

1260
01:36:21,681 --> 01:36:25,001
There, behind you.
Miss Shobha, your niece.

1261
01:36:25,770 --> 01:36:28,770
Shobha! Pitambar's daughter!

1262
01:36:29,929 --> 01:36:31,602
But, how can you say that?

1263
01:36:32,229 --> 01:36:35,120
Though Miss Shobha herself
never told me this..

1264
01:36:35,816 --> 01:36:38,314
But I have investigated
the matter completely.

1265
01:36:38,481 --> 01:36:41,012
- What proof do you have?
- We have the proof.

1266
01:36:41,597 --> 01:36:45,468
Now there is no doubt that Ms.
Shobha is Pitambar's daughter!

1267
01:36:47,082 --> 01:36:49,466
Shobha! My niece!

1268
01:36:49,998 --> 01:36:51,794
Come here, dear. Come near me!

1269
01:36:52,911 --> 01:36:57,229
Am I dreaming? I'm very fortunate.

1270
01:36:58,851 --> 01:37:05,237
Mr. Rajesh you have given
me peace in my old age.

1271
01:37:05,768 --> 01:37:08,947
Not only you,
but everybody is now peaceful.

1272
01:37:09,593 --> 01:37:14,513
Because the will that's the cause
of all the quarrels has been settled.

1273
01:37:15,675 --> 01:37:19,675
I hope now there won't be
any danger of the black shadow man.

1274
01:37:20,613 --> 01:37:22,613
Tonight everybody will
be able to sleep peacefully.

1275
01:37:25,121 --> 01:37:26,153
Can I come in?

1276
01:37:26,194 --> 01:37:27,587
Not now! Wait!

1277
01:37:27,628 --> 01:37:29,327
How long should I wait? I'm in hurry!

1278
01:37:29,591 --> 01:37:31,247
God! You have come!

1279
01:37:31,469 --> 01:37:33,417
I was just going to come!

1280
01:37:33,781 --> 01:37:35,177
Why do you embarrass me?

1281
01:37:36,294 --> 01:37:38,094
There is a huge difference
between you and me.

1282
01:37:39,257 --> 01:37:40,817
Forget coming to meet me

1283
01:37:41,788 --> 01:37:44,330
its against your pride
to even think of meeting me.

1284
01:37:44,745 --> 01:37:47,144
- What has happened to you?
- Nothing.

1285
01:37:47,185 --> 01:37:50,330
I'm an ordinary man and you
are the owner of this vast estate.

1286
01:37:50,823 --> 01:37:53,092
I am not the kind of girl
who will change after becoming..

1287
01:37:53,116 --> 01:37:54,436
The owner of this vast estate.

1288
01:37:56,498 --> 01:38:00,258
I'll always remain the same for you.

1289
01:38:01,483 --> 01:38:03,163
And I'll always remain the same.

1290
01:38:03,763 --> 01:38:05,733
I didn't hope that you would express..

1291
01:38:06,918 --> 01:38:11,004
Your feelings for me so soon.

1292
01:38:11,164 --> 01:38:12,756
So you have come to jest with me?

1293
01:38:14,539 --> 01:38:16,959
Then? What?

1294
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,878
I mean, what I said in front
of everybody that was wrong.

1295
01:38:21,542 --> 01:38:24,518
- Now, what I am saying, is true.
- What is true?

1296
01:38:24,979 --> 01:38:27,273
If the black shadow man
is the one whom I doubt..

1297
01:38:27,598 --> 01:38:31,252
Then he will launch
his last attack today.

1298
01:38:31,596 --> 01:38:33,766
Then why don't you arrest
the person whom you doubt?

1299
01:38:33,885 --> 01:38:36,487
I want to nab him red handed.

1300
01:38:37,556 --> 01:38:41,176
Else, I got so many chances.
I could have caught him anytime.

1301
01:38:41,593 --> 01:38:43,393
Your way of working is strange.

1302
01:38:43,535 --> 01:38:47,310
That's true.
But you will have to be very careful.

1303
01:38:47,945 --> 01:38:52,118
- This time your life is in danger.
- My life?

1304
01:38:52,511 --> 01:38:55,448
But you don't worry.
I've planned everything.

1305
01:38:55,543 --> 01:38:56,623
What?

1306
01:38:58,612 --> 01:39:00,768
I'll sleep in your room tonight.

1307
01:39:00,902 --> 01:39:02,302
And you will sleep in my room.

1308
01:39:02,757 --> 01:39:05,959
- Meaning?
- I'll tell you later.

1309
01:39:30,117 --> 01:39:33,372
Ma'am! Why had you
gone to the doctor's room?

1310
01:39:33,965 --> 01:39:35,098
Just like that.

1311
01:39:35,859 --> 01:39:38,026
Does anybody go to meet
somebody without any reason?

1312
01:39:38,331 --> 01:39:40,531
- What were you talking to him?
- None of your business!

1313
01:39:55,659 --> 01:39:56,739
What's this?

1314
01:39:57,361 --> 01:39:59,356
Today, why are you
sleeping in my place?

1315
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:01,429
Pick up your mattress and leave!

1316
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:05,075
What? Tonight something's
going to happen!

1317
01:40:05,116 --> 01:40:06,649
I'll sleep near the window! It's true!

1318
01:40:06,749 --> 01:40:07,893
Get up!

1319
01:40:09,351 --> 01:40:10,842
You are already dumb and deaf.

1320
01:40:10,937 --> 01:40:13,590
I'll blind you too. Then you can rot!

1321
01:40:13,631 --> 01:40:14,741
Get up! Come on!

1322
01:40:18,129 --> 01:40:20,907
Is that so? Fine.

1323
01:40:33,996 --> 01:40:36,236
Help! Help!

1324
01:40:36,338 --> 01:40:40,401
You are dumb and you can talk!

1325
01:40:42,656 --> 01:40:44,462
You are pretending!

1326
01:40:44,503 --> 01:40:47,031
Forgive me! I beg you!

1327
01:40:48,017 --> 01:40:49,537
Now, you have come on the right track.

1328
01:40:50,034 --> 01:40:52,904
- Balram!
- I forgive you!

1329
01:40:58,148 --> 01:41:01,223
Tell me, why are you
pretending to be deaf and dumb?

1330
01:41:01,477 --> 01:41:02,557
Nothing, nothing.

1331
01:41:02,945 --> 01:41:04,710
Tell me the truth,
or else, I'll call sir.

1332
01:41:04,751 --> 01:41:06,271
I will tell you! I will tell you!

1333
01:41:06,783 --> 01:41:08,227
I came here as deaf and dumb.

1334
01:41:08,319 --> 01:41:10,302
So sir took pity
on me and gave me work.

1335
01:41:10,566 --> 01:41:12,886
- Else I would have starved!
- You are lying.

1336
01:41:12,998 --> 01:41:14,758
I swear, I'm telling the truth.

1337
01:41:15,204 --> 01:41:18,490
If you will tell anybody
then I'll be in trouble.

1338
01:41:18,656 --> 01:41:19,891
Do you think I'll spare you?

1339
01:41:20,065 --> 01:41:21,805
You compete with
me in Champa's matter?

1340
01:41:21,846 --> 01:41:23,344
I'll never look at Champa.

1341
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:25,060
I'll consider her
as my mother or sister.

1342
01:41:25,141 --> 01:41:31,278
And everyday I'll give you
something that will make you soar.

1343
01:41:31,438 --> 01:41:32,579
You will see stars during daylight.

1344
01:41:32,603 --> 01:41:34,511
Is that so? What is that thing?

1345
01:41:34,584 --> 01:41:36,824
But please, let me remain
dumb and deaf before everybody.

1346
01:41:37,009 --> 01:41:38,610
I'll remain your slave.

1347
01:41:38,666 --> 01:41:41,199
- You'll have to be my slave. Think about it.
- Yes.

1348
01:41:43,072 --> 01:41:44,552
Is that so?

1349
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Give me a matchstick!

1350
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:13,388
"Again the same pain.
Again the same heart."

1351
01:42:13,429 --> 01:42:17,354
"Again the same night.
Again the same fear."

1352
01:42:17,577 --> 01:42:21,117
"I thought the pain has left."

1353
01:42:21,213 --> 01:42:23,166
"The door of my heart is open."

1354
01:42:23,335 --> 01:42:27,509
"The elephant left
leaving the tail behind."

1355
01:42:28,102 --> 01:42:32,046
"Again the same pain.
Again the same heart."

1356
01:42:32,281 --> 01:42:36,127
"Again the same night.
Again the same fear."

1357
01:42:36,468 --> 01:42:40,005
"I thought the pain has left."

1358
01:42:40,046 --> 01:42:42,115
"The door of my heart is open."

1359
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:46,781
"The elephant left
leaving the tail behind."

1360
01:42:55,038 --> 01:42:58,958
"I thought the enemy's
hand is chopped off."

1361
01:42:58,999 --> 01:43:03,380
"The hurdle between two
hearts has been removed."

1362
01:43:03,421 --> 01:43:07,101
"I thought the enemy's
hand is chopped off."

1363
01:43:07,327 --> 01:43:11,261
"The hurdle between two
hearts has been removed."

1364
01:43:11,554 --> 01:43:15,140
"The days of sorrow are over."

1365
01:43:15,202 --> 01:43:17,173
"The door of my heart is open."

1366
01:43:17,281 --> 01:43:21,551
"The elephant left
leaving the tail behind."

1367
01:43:22,124 --> 01:43:25,831
"Again the same pain.
Again the same heart."

1368
01:43:26,194 --> 01:43:30,437
"Again the same night.
Again the same fear."

1369
01:43:46,788 --> 01:43:50,870
"You will be my bride.
And the notes will be played."

1370
01:43:55,111 --> 01:43:58,791
"You will be my bride.
And the notes will be played."

1371
01:43:59,132 --> 01:44:03,163
"The twilight of sweet
union has arrived."

1372
01:44:03,304 --> 01:44:07,039
"You will be my bride.
And the notes will be played."

1373
01:44:07,205 --> 01:44:11,285
"The twilight of sweet
union has arrived."

1374
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:14,925
"But there was some dearth."

1375
01:44:14,968 --> 01:44:17,123
"The door of my heart is open."

1376
01:44:17,164 --> 01:44:21,578
"The elephant left
leaving the tail behind."

1377
01:44:21,733 --> 01:44:25,643
"Again the same pain.
Again the same heart."

1378
01:44:25,869 --> 01:44:29,629
"Again the same night.
Again the same fear."

1379
01:44:29,936 --> 01:44:33,414
"The door of my heart is open."

1380
01:44:33,486 --> 01:44:35,406
"The elephant left..

1381
01:44:35,621 --> 01:44:40,101
Leaving the tail behind."

1382
01:45:08,436 --> 01:45:12,381
"I thought I will forget.
Why will I be bad?"

1383
01:45:12,621 --> 01:45:16,781
"But your beauty is so mesmerizing."

1384
01:45:16,822 --> 01:45:20,662
"I thought I will forget.
Why will I be bad?"

1385
01:45:21,035 --> 01:45:24,764
"But your beauty is so mesmerizing."

1386
01:45:25,063 --> 01:45:28,453
"It has a bit of the same effect."

1387
01:45:28,581 --> 01:45:30,541
"The door of my heart is open."

1388
01:45:30,712 --> 01:45:34,893
"The elephant left
leaving the tail behind."

1389
01:45:35,297 --> 01:45:39,141
"Again the same pain.
Again the same heart."

1390
01:45:39,334 --> 01:45:43,334
"Again the same night.
Again the same fear."

1391
01:45:43,611 --> 01:45:47,079
"I thought the pain has left."

1392
01:45:47,181 --> 01:45:49,166
"The door of my heart is open."

1393
01:45:49,207 --> 01:45:57,207
"The elephant left
leaving the tail behind."

1394
01:46:13,164 --> 01:46:14,764
Today you have come so early?

1395
01:46:16,242 --> 01:46:18,911
But, right now, leave from here.

1396
01:46:19,272 --> 01:46:21,871
The detective doubts us. Understand!

1397
01:46:26,509 --> 01:46:29,639
What happened?
Why don't you say something?

1398
01:46:33,778 --> 01:46:38,938
You! Why did you come to
scare me wearing this attire?

1399
01:46:39,807 --> 01:46:41,231
Not to scare you!

1400
01:46:41,364 --> 01:46:43,267
But to find out who
is the black shadow man.

1401
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:45,828
- Tell me.
- I don't know anything.

1402
01:46:46,235 --> 01:46:48,013
- You are lying.
- Lying?

1403
01:46:48,783 --> 01:46:50,670
- What nonsense!
- Keep quiet!

1404
01:46:51,509 --> 01:46:54,429
Yesterday, you declined the presence
of black shadow man in this room.

1405
01:46:55,088 --> 01:46:56,533
But you don't know that..

1406
01:46:56,712 --> 01:46:58,830
The police have sufficient
evidence against you.

1407
01:46:59,291 --> 01:47:01,813
Why should I fear when
I've not done anything?

1408
01:47:02,893 --> 01:47:05,293
Why did you go to Rai Bahadur's
place along with Shrinath?

1409
01:47:05,653 --> 01:47:06,813
I didn't go there.

1410
01:47:07,434 --> 01:47:10,173
- Didn't you serve liquor to Rai Bahadur?
- No.

1411
01:47:10,603 --> 01:47:12,673
You are declining everything.

1412
01:47:12,830 --> 01:47:14,453
But the outcome will be bad.

1413
01:47:15,237 --> 01:47:17,243
The police will arrest you!
You will be sentenced!

1414
01:47:17,284 --> 01:47:18,644
You will be imprisoned and hanged!

1415
01:47:20,489 --> 01:47:22,669
- No!
- Yes!

1416
01:47:23,015 --> 01:47:25,735
Now tell me! Where you
an accomplice in Shrinath's ruse?

1417
01:47:25,776 --> 01:47:27,362
- No!
- No?

1418
01:47:27,403 --> 01:47:28,655
Yes!

1419
01:47:28,813 --> 01:47:32,036
- Shrinath had gone to Rai Bahadur's place to steal the will!
- Yes.

1420
01:47:32,196 --> 01:47:34,705
- And he murdered Rai Bahadur!
- Yes.

1421
01:47:35,073 --> 01:47:37,993
And now after Shrinath's death,
the man who's roaming around as the..

1422
01:47:38,034 --> 01:47:41,009
- Black shadow man and who wants to seize the wealth, you know him.
- No.

1423
01:47:41,466 --> 01:47:43,666
- Tell me the truth!
- Yes!

1424
01:47:43,930 --> 01:47:45,710
Tell me, who is the black shadow man?

1425
01:47:46,561 --> 01:47:48,432
- Black shadow man!
- Yes!

1426
01:47:48,473 --> 01:47:49,614
Answer me!

1427
01:47:49,916 --> 01:47:51,436
Answer me!
Who is the black shadow man!

1428
01:47:51,813 --> 01:47:55,995
I will tell you.
I will tell you, everything.

1429
01:48:03,768 --> 01:48:07,518
Lily! Tell me who is he? Tell me!

1430
01:48:11,312 --> 01:48:13,175
- What happened?
- Somebody fired a shot!

1431
01:48:14,391 --> 01:48:16,235
- What happened, sir?
- You and in this attire?

1432
01:48:16,276 --> 01:48:18,746
Yes! But it was futile.
Lily has been murdered.

1433
01:48:21,703 --> 01:48:24,648
Ram Singh! Go to the city
quickly and inform inspector Sinha.

1434
01:48:24,774 --> 01:48:26,943
- Tell him to come here immediately.
- Okay, sir.

1435
01:48:28,906 --> 01:48:30,816
Now, what has again happened?

1436
01:48:31,266 --> 01:48:34,785
Sorry. A letter for you.

1437
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:37,171
Who opened this?

1438
01:48:37,212 --> 01:48:39,336
I think the post office
forgot to stick it.

1439
01:48:41,174 --> 01:48:42,357
Why are you standing? Leave!

1440
01:48:55,397 --> 01:48:56,828
So, I was right.

1441
01:49:53,416 --> 01:49:54,416
What happened?

1442
01:49:54,451 --> 01:49:57,663
Shobha, today, I shot the
black shadow man on his leg.

1443
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:03,343
A line of blood tickles from
the window of your room and ends here.

1444
01:50:03,891 --> 01:50:06,386
- So, you think..
- I'm sure.

1445
01:50:06,638 --> 01:50:09,023
There's a secret passageway here.

1446
01:50:21,072 --> 01:50:23,050
- Don't go inside.
- Don't stop me, Shobha!

1447
01:50:23,196 --> 01:50:25,352
I can't turn back now
that I am so close to success.

1448
01:50:25,470 --> 01:50:27,353
- Is there any danger?
- Don't worry.

1449
01:50:27,471 --> 01:50:29,711
You go downstairs.
And as soon as inspector Sinha comes..

1450
01:50:29,862 --> 01:50:32,015
Send him to the
backyard of this bungalow.

1451
01:50:32,225 --> 01:50:34,145
I think the secret
passageway ends there.

1452
01:50:34,279 --> 01:50:35,953
- Be careful.
- Don't worry.

1453
01:50:54,781 --> 01:50:56,145
Doctor, you!

1454
01:50:59,826 --> 01:51:02,601
I'm fine.
You follow the evil black shadow man.

1455
01:51:02,695 --> 01:51:03,970
- But you?
- Don't worry about me!

1456
01:51:03,994 --> 01:51:06,101
Quickly go! Otherwise, he will escape!

1457
01:51:31,677 --> 01:51:34,512
Look, keep the search light ready.

1458
01:54:04,589 --> 01:54:07,186
You all must be eager
to know the culprit who's..

1459
01:54:07,719 --> 01:54:10,294
Hiding behind the black mask.

1460
01:54:11,220 --> 01:54:12,989
Wait a bit longer!

1461
01:54:13,649 --> 01:54:17,662
Initially, we doubted Miss Shobha,
doctor, manager..

1462
01:54:18,017 --> 01:54:20,008
Dinanath, everybody.

1463
01:54:20,679 --> 01:54:25,254
Because everybody had
a motive to murder Shrinath.

1464
01:54:25,838 --> 01:54:29,930
Even the youngest brother
Pitambar who's still missing..

1465
01:54:30,055 --> 01:54:31,432
We doubted him too.

1466
01:54:32,220 --> 01:54:36,111
But you all will be amazed to know
that none of them is the murderer.

1467
01:54:39,534 --> 01:54:40,792
Mr. Dinanath!

1468
01:54:41,230 --> 01:54:42,573
This old and crippled man!

1469
01:54:44,543 --> 01:54:49,087
You all maybe be dazed, that
in spite of being old and crippled..

1470
01:54:49,456 --> 01:54:50,766
How he committed the murder?

1471
01:54:51,511 --> 01:54:54,486
And how did he raise so much
commotion as the black shadow man.

1472
01:54:54,772 --> 01:54:55,583
Then?

1473
01:54:55,624 --> 01:54:57,932
Actually, he's not Dinanath.

1474
01:54:58,767 --> 01:55:01,543
In fact, the culprit is somebody
else in the guise of Dinanath.

1475
01:55:04,815 --> 01:55:05,948
Sir!

1476
01:55:06,190 --> 01:55:07,019
Mr. Shrinath!

1477
01:55:07,151 --> 01:55:11,076
Shrinath didn't die. In fact
he killed his elder brother Dinanath.

1478
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:13,524
And he himself became Dinanath.

1479
01:55:15,824 --> 01:55:19,363
Dinanath and Shrinath's
face resembled.

1480
01:55:19,906 --> 01:55:22,685
And he took advantage of this.

1481
01:55:23,214 --> 01:55:25,962
This was done very
carefully and cunningly.

1482
01:55:26,245 --> 01:55:27,962
There were two motives behind this.

1483
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:30,930
Firstly, to escape from the
charge of murdering Rai Bahadur.

1484
01:55:31,244 --> 01:55:34,922
And secondly to gain the inheritance
in the guise of Dinanath.

1485
01:55:35,761 --> 01:55:38,515
And nobody could have thought that..

1486
01:55:38,971 --> 01:55:41,642
Old and crippled Dinanath
is the black shadow man.

1487
01:55:42,321 --> 01:55:45,370
Like me, even the doctor doubted him.

1488
01:55:46,056 --> 01:55:49,178
He received the telegram
of the post mortem report..

1489
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:52,163
That the body belonged
to a crippled man.

1490
01:55:53,141 --> 01:55:56,802
Actually wealth and greed
has made Shrinath blind!

1491
01:55:57,438 --> 01:56:00,266
He murdered Rai Bahadur!
He murdered Lily!

1492
01:56:00,307 --> 01:56:01,437
He murdered Dinanath!

1493
01:56:02,004 --> 01:56:04,178
And he tried to murder Miss Shobha!

1494
01:56:05,906 --> 01:56:10,178
No matter how cunningly the crime
is committed it never can be hidden.

1495
01:56:10,884 --> 01:56:14,709
Inspector Sinha, I hand over
this dangerous culprit to you!

1496
01:56:15,307 --> 01:56:16,526
Bahadur Singh!

1497
01:56:27,087 --> 01:56:29,436
Because my work is over now..

1498
01:56:29,689 --> 01:56:31,828
I take everybody's
permission to leave.

1499
01:56:38,948 --> 01:56:40,137
Listen!

1500
01:56:42,297 --> 01:56:46,537
Am I included in the people
whose permission you take to leave?

1501
01:56:46,578 --> 01:56:49,218
Why? Do you still
have some work with me?

1502
01:56:49,822 --> 01:56:51,287
- Yes.
- What?

1503
01:56:52,775 --> 01:56:54,025
Do I have to tell you that?

1504
01:56:56,550 --> 01:56:57,778
So, will you come with me?

1505
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:01,785
I'm so lucky!

1506
01:57:02,510 --> 01:57:04,297
I had come to arrest the culprit.

1507
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:07,088
And I myself got arrested.

1508
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:10,111
Sorry, sir. What's the order for me?

1509
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,489
You come later along
with the luggage by the train.

1510
01:57:13,519 --> 01:57:14,519
Let's go.
