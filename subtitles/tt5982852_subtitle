'This film is a work of fiction and

00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:18,641
'or dead is merely co-incident
and unintentional.'

4
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:22,801
'All characters and names used
in this film are fictitious.'

5
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:26,361
'This film is for entertainment
purpose and has no intentions'

6
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:30,081
'of disrespecting
any community, city or state.'

7
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:33,721
'This film is a work of fiction and
is not based on nor intended to be'

00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:35,721

00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,201
'All characters, backdrops and

00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:46,921
'and the names used in this film
are fictitious'

13
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:50,401
'and any resemblance to reality,

'This film is for entertainment
purpose and has'

16
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:57,921
'no intentions of disrespecting
any community, city or state.'

17
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:01,441
Got it!

18
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,041
He got the paper!

19
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:06,361
Sir, I have the paper.

20
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:11,081
Attention, children

21
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:13,081
please don't start answering
your question paper yet.

22
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:14,401
Pretty soon

23
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:16,961
we'll be giving out the correct
answers to all the questions.

24
00:03:17,241 --> 00:03:20,921
No child is going to fail
their English exam this year

25
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,081
because I've taken
the responsibility

26
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:24,201
to help you cheat and pass.

27
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:29,361
Oh, Birbal, where's the guy?

28
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:31,401
The paper has been distributed
already, it's getting late.

29
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:35,521
Sir, don't get so restless.
He'll be here soon.

30
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:38,521
This is the English exam.
I hope you called an educated guy.

31
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:42,841
He's a qualified advocate!
B.A.L.L.B.

32
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,841
Where have you been, sir?
- Greetings.

33
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:07,921
The paper has been distributed.

34
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:09,281
It's getting late and the
children are waiting.

35
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:10,641
Hello, sir.

36
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:18,441
Good morning, children.

37
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,441
Question no. 1. Essay!

38
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,121
This means, composition.

39
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:24,961
Those with even roll numbers

40
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:28,281
like 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

41
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,921
will write on 'My Best Friend'.

42
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,601
And those with odd roll
numbers will write on 'The Cow'.

43
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,241
If everyone writes
the same essay

44
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:38,041
the examiner will think
that you've all copied. Right?

45
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,481
So now, write as I say.
'My Best Friend'.

46
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,721
I have many friends.

47
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:45,641
But Brijmohan Arora
is my best friend.

48
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:47,761
Please don't write
the name Brijmohan Arora

49
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:49,561
instead write the
name of your best friend.

50
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:51,281
Now for those writing
an essay on the cow.

51
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:53,361
Cow is a holy animal.

52
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:55,401
H-O-L-Y.

53
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:58,041
Please don't misspell holy,
you rascals.

54
00:04:58,161 --> 00:05:00,441
Otherwise you'll get less marks.

55
00:04:58,161 --> 00:05:00,441
Otherwise you'll get less marks.

56
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:23,761
See, sir, the paper has been
finished before time.

57
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:25,241
He is right.

58
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:27,081
Now pay up,
I must get to the court.

59
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,441
Here you go.
- That's more like it.

60
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:34,521
Rs. 3,000?

61
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:36,841
Wasn't the deal for Rs. 5,000?
- Yes, sir.

62
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,721
You came 15 minutes late, sir.

63
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:41,601
Call it a late fee.

64
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:46,161
I knew you would do
something sneaky like this.

65
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:49,441
I answered the last
four questions wrong!

66
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:51,481
What?
- What is he saying?

67
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:53,481
And only 15 minutes are left now.

68
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,001
You charged them for
1st class results

69
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:56,161
but I doubt they'll even pass.

70
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:57,441
Let's see what you can do now!

71
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:59,601
Give him the money.
- Do something.

72
00:05:59,681 --> 00:06:02,481
Children, don't submit
your answer sheets yet.

73
00:05:59,681 --> 00:06:02,481
Children, don't submit
your answer sheets yet.

74
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:06,081
There's been an error.
The lawyer will rectify it!

75
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:08,721
Here.

76
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:14,721
Please submit your
papers to the examiner.

77
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:15,641
What is he saying?

78
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:18,281
All your answers
are absolutely correct.

79
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:23,361
Even Obama's mom
can't fail you this time!

80
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:24,521
Jai Hind.

81
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:28,521
But you said that the last four
answers were wrong.

82
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:32,081
My name is
Jagdishwar Mishra aka Jolly!

83
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:34,881
Lawyer by profession
and a resident of Kanpur.

84
00:06:36,281 --> 00:06:38,521
If I let an illiterate
like you make a fool of me

85
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:40,841
what good is my law degree?

86
00:06:40,921 --> 00:06:43,441
See you.
If you need anything, do call.

87
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,561
Watch out! Watch out!

88
00:06:58,121 --> 00:06:59,521
Move aside!

89
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:05,001
Hello, sir.
- Hello.. - Hello.

90
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:07,521
Hello! Yes, have a good day!

91
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:13,201
Watch where you're going!

92
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:15,241
Do you want to read
everything in one day?

93
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:26,241
Coming here every day
won't make a difference, Hina.

94
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:29,081
Mr. Rizvi won't
get convinced so easily.

95
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:30,721
I'm a lawyer too.

96
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:33,481
Why don't you tell me
about your case?

97
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:34,921
Have faith in me.

98
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:37,161
No, sir, that's not the point.

99
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:40,241
You see, Mr. Rizvi has defended
such cases before, and so..

100
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:44,721
And anyway no high-profile lawyer
is willing to take up my case.

101
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:48,081
Mr. Rizvi is my only hope.

102
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:51,881
Who knows maybe some day
he'll take pity on my condition.

103
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:55,121
I pity you, even if he doesn't.

104
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:58,121
Take my advice, Hina
and don't come here.

105
00:07:58,241 --> 00:07:59,121
It's no use.

106
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:01,761
He won't defend your case.
Let it go.

107
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:01,761
He won't defend your case.
Let it go.

108
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:05,561
How can I give up so easily, sir?

109
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:08,841
Listen.

110
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:14,361
Can you put in a word for me?

111
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:16,521
Who? With Mr. Rizvi? No..
- Yes..

112
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:19,841
Please.. - No..
- Just put in a word for me once.

113
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:22,961
You're one of his oldest assistants,
he might listen to you.

114
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:24,961
Please try, for my sake.
I'll be grateful.

115
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:27,801
Okay,
let's assume that he agrees.

116
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,641
How will you pay his fee?

117
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:32,761
Do you know how expensive he is?

118
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:34,481
Have you thought about
where you'll get the money from?

119
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:37,321
No, I'll pay him
whatever his fee comes to.

120
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:38,561
Don't worry.

121
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:40,801
I just want him to agree.

122
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:43,521
Fine, I'll talk to him today

123
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:45,081
if he's in a good mood.

124
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:46,601
Because he's flying
to Delhi tomorrow.

125
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:48,681
Thank you very much, sir.

126
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:50,761
Just a minute.
- What now?

127
00:08:55,641 --> 00:08:56,881
Case files.

128
00:08:57,521 --> 00:08:59,761
He'll understand everything
once he reads these.

129
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:02,601
I will wait for your call.

130
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:04,721
Goodbye.
- See you.

131
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:08,961
Ma'am,
should I handle your case?

132
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:10,481
Get lost,
you good-for-nothing lawyer.

133
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:14,401
Take Lord Ram's name.

134
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,961
Take Lord Shyam's name.

135
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:17,481
Take Lord Krishna's name.

136
00:09:17,561 --> 00:09:21,201
Lord Mukund Madhav, Govind..
- Jolly!

137
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:23,801
I can't seem to find the
material for this case.

138
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:24,961
Take Lord Shyam's name.

139
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:27,481
If Mr. Rizvi gets furious,
I'll blame you.

140
00:09:27,561 --> 00:09:28,881
Take Lord Ram's name.

141
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,601
Get some stamp papers as well!
Secretary.

142
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:38,841
Why? Are you going
to write your will

143
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:40,521
or divorce your wife?

144
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:43,161
And my father was the secretary,
Pandey, not me.

145
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:46,961
I'll need a secretary pretty soon.
Remember to send in your resume.

146
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,641
I'll see.
- Why are you getting so furious?

147
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:51,121
I was just joking.

148
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:53,001
You should be thankful
that I'm only furious

149
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:54,161
and not getting violent.

150
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:55,361
Or maybe I should?

151
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:57,241
Jolly, seems like Mr. Rizvi
has arrived.

152
00:09:57,321 --> 00:09:58,481
Sir has arrived.
- Hold this.

153
00:09:58,561 --> 00:09:59,601
You'll get shouted at again!

154
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:05,801
Mr. Rizvi is here.

155
00:10:19,721 --> 00:10:20,961
Greetings.

156
00:10:21,161 --> 00:10:21,961
What's today's schedule?

157
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:24,561
Sir, the minister's statement
is supposed to be recorded today

158
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:25,561
regarding the
LDA land grabbing case.

159
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:27,441
And then the charge-sheet
is supposed to be filed today

160
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:28,601
in the session's court
for the Sitapur murder case.

161
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:29,681
Then..

162
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:31,961
You must get to the High Court
by 2 o'clock, sir

163
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:33,481
for the Ganj blast case.

164
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,721
And then at five..
- Enough.

165
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:38,961
There's only so much
I can do in one day.

166
00:10:39,161 --> 00:10:40,521
I'll only go to
the High Court today.

167
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:41,681
Yes, sir.

168
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:47,441
Did you forget something?
- Betel leaf.

169
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:49,321
Oh, yes.

170
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:55,041
Sorry!

171
00:10:58,361 --> 00:10:59,881
State vs. Kurla.

172
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:07,201
With your permission, may I go on
your behalf to the sessions court?

173
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:09,961
You will be happy to know
that I've studied the entire case.

174
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:11,881
You? Instead of me?

175
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:16,881
Well, there's no one in Lucknow
yet who can fill my shoes.

176
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:19,561
If you don't believe me,
ask your father.

177
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:22,641
First learn court etiquette.

178
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:26,001
You don't have an
ounce of civility in you.

179
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:29,401
I only asked because I was free.

180
00:11:30,281 --> 00:11:31,921
Stick to doing what you know.

181
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:34,961
There's a party at
my house in the evening.

182
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:38,121
My wife will need your help.
Be there.

183
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:46,961
Sir, there's a girl who wants..

184
00:11:58,081 --> 00:11:59,681
Hey, Jolly!

185
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:03,321
Come here.
- Listen!

186
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:04,601
You come here!

187
00:12:06,361 --> 00:12:07,401
I have a case for you.

188
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:10,961
I'm not playing anymore.

189
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:12,681
This isn't right, Jolly,
you were winning.

190
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:14,761
Should I be a loser like you?

191
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,721
Will you take up the case?
- Who's the client? - He is.

192
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:22,081
Him?
Where did you find him?

193
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,801
Looks like I'll have
to pay him instead.

194
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:25,561
He's already paid in advance.

195
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:29,241
But if you don't win,
you'll have to return the fee.

196
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:32,521
A real lawyer never
returns the fee.

197
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:33,521
What is the case?

198
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:35,041
It's interesting.

199
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:36,601
Who is the judge?
- Harbhajan Singh.

200
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:37,561
Come on..
- Let's go.

201
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:38,681
Come, Mr. Sitaram.

202
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:42,521
'Please maintain silence.
A session is on.'

203
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:48,521
Yes, please begin.
- Please.

204
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:53,281
Your Honour,
15 years ago my client's relatives..

205
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:54,881
Is this your first
time in court?

206
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:56,681
Stand up!
Don't you have any manners?

207
00:12:56,961 --> 00:12:57,961
Oh, yes, Your Honour.

208
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:01,321
Sorry!

209
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:05,721
Your Honour, 15 years ago
my client's relatives

210
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:07,321
for the greed of money

211
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:11,321
faked his death certificate
and usurped his entire property.

212
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:16,561
For the last 15 years, he's been
trying to prove that he's alive.

213
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:17,481
How strange!

214
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:21,201
According to my papers your client
has been dead for 15 years.

215
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:22,681
Look,
here's the death certificate

216
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,081
and the letter from
the village council.

217
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:27,441
And a report from
the local counsellor.

218
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:29,241
That's all paper, Your Honour.

219
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:32,881
The dead body is standing in
front of you alive. - So what?

220
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:34,961
You must get me some
kind of legal document

221
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,681
with his name written on it.

222
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:38,881
The Court believes
in documented facts.

223
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:43,001
Bring it in writing and I will
believe that he's Shah Rukh Khan.

224
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:44,841
Please don't do this.

225
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:46,921
Please order an investigation.
We'll be grateful.

226
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:48,681
Your request is denied.

227
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:53,321
Your Honour, I beg you,
please listen to me.

228
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:55,481
You see I finally have a case.

229
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,841
I've even taken an advance,
I can't return the fee. Please.

230
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,361
You don't have any court manners.

231
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,361
You don't have any court manners.

232
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,441
I'll learn everything.
Please, just listen.

233
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:05,241
This lawyer will bless you.

234
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:08,521
I swear by God, you look just
like Manmohan Singh in this turban.

235
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:10,601
Don't you understand?

236
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:13,321
I'll charge you with contempt of
court and you'll be rotting in jail.

237
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:15,921
Your Honour, please have
mercy on this helpless soul.

238
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:19,881
I've been doing rounds of
the court for the last 15 years

239
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:21,961
and now I'm completely ruined!

240
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,161
Poor guy's wailing!
He's completely shattered.

241
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:25,441
Please show him some mercy.

242
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:28,321
Tell your client to stop this
charade, it's not going to work.

243
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,601
Take him away!

244
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:33,961
I'll go, but not
without giving you a gift!

245
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:38,681
Sitaram! No! How dare you
throw a shoe at a judge!

246
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:40,961
No..
- It's what you deserve, you dog!

247
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:43,721
Lock him up!
Court is adjourned!

248
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:46,161
Now there's an FIR
against Sitaram.

249
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:48,281
That poor guy's going
to rot in jail now.

250
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:51,041
And we'll have to
return the money as well.

251
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:53,281
Oh, Jolly
- Bravo, sir!

252
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:57,441
In 15 minutes you achieved
what others couldn't in 15 years.

253
00:14:57,721 --> 00:15:00,841
A police FIR, but at least
my name's on a legal document now.

254
00:14:57,721 --> 00:15:00,841
A police FIR, but at least
my name's on a legal document now.

255
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:03,721
Now show that copy of the
FIR to the administrator, sir.

256
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:06,201
Yes. - Along with the cutting
of the news report

257
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:07,881
which will get published
in tomorrow's newspaper.

258
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:10,321
Late Sitaram is alive.
- Yes.

259
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:13,601
Let's go. - Take care, Sitaram!
- Yes.

260
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:17,641
You're so crafty.

261
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:21,121
But how long will you waste
away at Rizvi's place?

262
00:15:21,281 --> 00:15:22,801
Just a few more days.

263
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:26,721
Once I have my own chamber,
I'll quit.

264
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:28,321
Where to?

265
00:15:28,481 --> 00:15:30,201
To make kebabs at Mr. Rizvi's home.
Coming along?

266
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:33,201
No, you're the multi-talented one.

267
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,081
Pushpa!

268
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:58,721
Pushpa..

269
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:01,121
Pushpa, my sweetheart!

270
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:01,121
Pushpa, my sweetheart!

271
00:16:02,641 --> 00:16:06,241
Open the door, Pushpa!
- Oh, no. Not again.

272
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:07,921
Open the door, Pushpa!

273
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,041
What was the fight
about this time, Jolly?

274
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:16,321
It's nothing, ma'am. It's her
younger brother's wedding.

275
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:18,401
She wanted a Gucci dress.

276
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:21,561
I said no and she
started World War 3.

277
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:25,841
Pushpa! - Munna!
Get up and get the ladder.

278
00:16:26,641 --> 00:16:30,081
Jolly and Pushpa fought again.
Go on. - Come on, Mom.

279
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:32,041
Help your neighbour. Go.

280
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:37,961
Jolly, why don't
you shift someplace else?

281
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:41,961
At least I won't
have to stay up at nights.

282
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:46,081
You're making my life hell.

283
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:47,721
Why don't you shift someplace else?

284
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:05,321
You think I can't come in
if you don't open the door?

285
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:09,401
Pushpa Pandey, MA Sanskrit.

286
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:14,281
I'm talking to you, stop pretending.
I know you're awake.

287
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:18,561
Even wars have
cease fires at night.

288
00:17:18,841 --> 00:17:21,321
Get up, we can get back to
being at loggerheads in the morning.

289
00:17:23,761 --> 00:17:25,481
Mr. Rizvi threw a party.

290
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:29,041
I snuck a bottle for you.

291
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,441
Don't say that I didn't offer you.

292
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,241
Hail the Lord.

293
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:58,121
Don't think this changes anything.

294
00:17:58,881 --> 00:18:01,961
This is only because
you spoke about a cease fire.

295
00:17:58,881 --> 00:18:01,961
This is only because
you spoke about a cease fire.

296
00:18:07,481 --> 00:18:08,961
You didn't get me
the Gucci dress.

297
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:11,161
Now you're pretending to love me?

298
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:14,481
What do you mean by 'pretending'?

299
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,361
Don't I love you?

300
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:20,881
Be honest, don't I love you?

301
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:23,961
Show me one husband in Lucknow

302
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,601
who makes a drink for his wife.

303
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:27,761
I'll concede.

304
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:29,161
If anyone finds out about this

305
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:30,481
we'll be ostracized.

306
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:33,801
And if I ostracise you, imagine
what you won't be getting.

307
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,401
There's no reason
to be so hot-headed.

308
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:39,801
All I need is a Lawyer's chamber.

309
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:43,881
And then I'll buy
the entire Gucci store for you.

310
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,361
Just make do till then.

311
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:49,321
You make do with yourself till then.

312
00:18:55,361 --> 00:18:56,521
And what will you tell Mr. Rizvi

313
00:18:56,561 --> 00:18:57,961
once you get your own chamber?

314
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,761
He doesn't consider me a lawyer.

315
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,961
Always treated me like
his secretary's son.

316
00:19:04,121 --> 00:19:05,521
After all,
he's a blue blood of Lucknow.

317
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:07,481
He assumes I'll be his secretary

318
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,161
for the next 30 years
like my father.

319
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:10,921
But once

320
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:13,641
I have my own chamber..

321
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:17,281
I'll show him what
a secretary's son can do.

322
00:19:18,081 --> 00:19:19,641
Just wait and watch, Pushpa

323
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:21,161
the city of Lucknow

324
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:24,681
will be talking about me.

325
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:27,961
Clients will queue up outside
my office.

326
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:31,601
I'll win many cases
and the world will say, 'There goes'

327
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:35,641
'Jagdish Mishra and his wife Pushpa
Pandey in their Rolls Royce.'

328
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:37,641
Pushpa..

329
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:45,961
Mama, I have to pee.

330
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:47,521
Mom's out cold.

331
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:50,521
I'll take you.

332
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:52,361
Let me unzip your pant.

333
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:55,321
Go on.

334
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:01,121
Aim for the plant.

335
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:01,121
Aim for the plant.

336
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,281
Here you go, Mr. Dubey.

337
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:12,161
Now quickly allot me a chamber.

338
00:20:14,601 --> 00:20:15,641
Only after you pay in full.

339
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,481
There's only Rs. 2 lakh left.

340
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:20,361
I'll pay up.
Give me the allotment letter

341
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:22,041
and I'll pay the rest.
Don't you believe me?

342
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,561
I told you

343
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:26,681
chambers are
only for senior lawyers.

344
00:20:27,401 --> 00:20:29,281
And you're Mr. Rizvi's
15th assistant.

345
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:31,641
You're just an amateur now.

346
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:35,201
Why else would I pay 1.2 million for
a chamber that costs only 8 lakh?

347
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:37,441
But don't underestimate me.

348
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:39,481
I have fought cases independently.

349
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:42,001
I have a visiting card
and an assistant.

350
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:43,921
Him?

351
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:45,641
Birbal?

352
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:49,961
Two days ago, he was selling tickets
illegally outside the movie hall.

353
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:52,041
How much do you make?

354
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:54,721
That's my personal matter.
Why do you care?

355
00:20:54,841 --> 00:20:57,921
Did I ever ask you how much you
earn by selling betel leaves?

356
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,321
Yadav!
- Yes, sir.

357
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:04,321
These are 20 betel leaves.
- Yes, sir.

358
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:06,001
Don't give them to anyone for free.
- Yes, sir.

359
00:21:07,761 --> 00:21:09,601
Listen, mister..
- Just a minute.

360
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:12,041
We are in a precarious situation.

361
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:14,721
Some unemployed lawyer, like you

362
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:18,801
has filed a petition in the High
Court against chamber allotment.

363
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,161
The hearing is after
the Holi festival.

364
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:24,361
If he wins,
you will lose your one million.

365
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:26,081
That's why my advice is

366
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:29,001
get me Rs. 2 lakh by tomorrow
and take your letter.

367
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,441
But, Mr. Dubey, how can we arrange
for so much money by tomorrow?

368
00:21:32,161 --> 00:21:33,121
We need some time.

369
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:35,841
You're a lawyer. Figure it out.

370
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:39,401
Haven't you heard?

371
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:43,121
A politician without his seat,
a superstar without a hit

372
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:45,561
and a lawyer without
a chamber is a nobody.

373
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:49,001
Here, take this free betel leaf.

374
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:54,601
Eat it, boss, it's worth millions.

375
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,321
Don't touch it!

376
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,321
Don't touch it!

377
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,961
Rs. 2 lakh, by tomorrow.

378
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:08,041
We're in trouble, boss.

379
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:11,961
We'll have to think of something.

380
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:14,361
We can't lose this chamber.
- Mr. Jolly!

381
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:16,801
Hina!

382
00:22:17,281 --> 00:22:18,201
How did you get here?

383
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:20,521
I was trying to call you,
but you didn't answer.

384
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:24,961
I was busy in a meeting.
- Any news for me?

385
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:28,161
Did you talk to Mr. Rizvi
about my case?

386
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:29,481
Yes, I talked to him

387
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:33,641
and the good news
is that he agreed.

388
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:35,361
Really?

389
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:39,241
He's agreed to take up my case?
- Of course, he did.

390
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:40,681
He said, 'I'll fight the case.'

391
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:45,001
I told you he would listen to you.

392
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:47,881
So when will my petition be filed?

393
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:50,361
After Holi. Come after Holi.

394
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:55,841
God bless you, sir, thank you.
- No, not at all.

395
00:22:55,881 --> 00:22:57,081
Thank you.

396
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:00,521
Well..

397
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:00,521
Well..

398
00:23:00,561 --> 00:23:03,721
Mr. Rizvi said that I
should tell you about the fee.

399
00:23:04,081 --> 00:23:05,641
Yes, of course.
How much will it be?

400
00:23:06,241 --> 00:23:07,801
He said it'll be Rs. 2 lakh.

401
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,841
That's too much.

402
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:15,521
Like I said, Mr. Rizvi
is a very expensive lawyer.

403
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:19,201
If you can't afford it, let it be.
- No..

404
00:23:19,521 --> 00:23:21,841
Don't worry at all.

405
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:24,441
Just give me some time.

406
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:28,321
Give me time until tomorrow.
I will arrange the money.

407
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:29,721
For sure.
- Great.

408
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:30,681
Then tomorrow..

409
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:32,201
Yes, I'll bring it.
- Don't forget.

410
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:34,441
Thank you.
- Okay.

411
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:41,961
If I don't give him Rs. 2 lakh more

412
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:45,641
I'll lose the one million
which I have already given him.

413
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:48,321
You're right.

414
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:52,481
But what if something
goes wrong later?

415
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,241
We'll return the money.
- How?

416
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:55,961
Once I get the chamber I'll get

417
00:23:55,961 --> 00:23:58,361
a loan against
the chamber's documents.

418
00:23:58,921 --> 00:24:00,201
It's a matter of a couple of days.

419
00:23:58,921 --> 00:24:00,201
It's a matter of a couple of days.

420
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:01,961
You're right.

421
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:02,961
Fine.

422
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:06,081
Jolly, Holi is going
to be fun this year.

423
00:24:06,281 --> 00:24:08,841
Where are you taking me?

424
00:24:08,921 --> 00:24:11,561
Let me see.
- We've reached.

425
00:24:12,841 --> 00:24:15,241
Now look.
- What is it?

426
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:17,681
Mishra Law Firm.

427
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:20,881
Jagdishwar Mishra aka Jolly. Ball..

428
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:23,601
No, Father,
it's not ball its B.A.L.L.B.

429
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:26,401
Oh, yes.

430
00:24:27,721 --> 00:24:30,481
Is this your chamber?

431
00:24:30,841 --> 00:24:33,081
You worked here for 30 years,
didn't you? - Yes.

432
00:24:33,161 --> 00:24:36,721
You wanted your son
to have his own chamber.

433
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:38,121
Wasn't that your dream?
- Yes..

434
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:40,761
I've fulfilled your dream.

435
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:52,321
"You shoot from the revolver
from eyes."

436
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:55,481
"It's Holi.."

437
00:24:55,521 --> 00:25:01,481
"Your poison is such
that kills slowly."

438
00:24:55,521 --> 00:25:01,481
"Your poison is such
that kills slowly."

439
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:02,561
"It's Holi.."

440
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:09,961
"You shoot from the revolver
from eyes. Your poison kills.."

441
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:13,281
"I'll throw colour on you..
I'll splash water on you."

442
00:25:13,321 --> 00:25:17,521
"I'll make you go red.
For its Holi!"

443
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:22,801
"Go crazy!
Go.. Go crazy.."

444
00:25:22,841 --> 00:25:26,201
"Go.. It's Holi.."

445
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:29,881
"Go crazy!
Go.. Go crazy.."

446
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:33,561
"Go.. It's Holi.."

447
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:42,281
"You look lovely when drenched.
The colours suit you. I love you."

448
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:49,321
"Let the cannabis work.
Don't be angry, for its Holi!"

449
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:54,841
"Hey, you mad one.
Put on your goggles."

450
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:56,801
"You won't get any towel."

451
00:25:56,841 --> 00:26:00,521
"The whole group is with me.
Don't act innocent."

452
00:25:56,841 --> 00:26:00,521
"The whole group is with me.
Don't act innocent."

453
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:04,161
"I have opened a liquor bottle
as it's Holi.."

454
00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:09,561
"Go crazy!
Go.. Go crazy.."

455
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,961
"Go.. It's Holi.."

456
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:16,761
"Go crazy!
Go.. Go crazy.."

457
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:20,361
"Go.. It's Holi.."

458
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:25,721
"I'll ruin all your plans."

459
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:29,161
"That's right."

460
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:32,961
"I won't let you have
your way."

461
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:36,321
"That's right."

462
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:43,521
"I'll ruin all your plans.
I won't let you have your way."

463
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:51,521
"Don't tease me, don't follow me.
Stop fluttering around me now."

464
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:56,241
"It's Holi! Go crazy!
Go.. Go crazy."

465
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,801
"Go.. It's Holi.."

466
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:03,561
"Go.. Go crazy.."

467
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:03,561
"Go.. Go crazy.."

468
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:07,161
"Go.. It's Holi.."

469
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:10,721
"Go.. Go crazy.."

470
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:14,361
"Go.. It's Holi.."

471
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:17,961
"Go.. Go crazy.."

472
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:21,561
"Go.. It's Holi.."

473
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:24,361
All your work will be done here.

474
00:27:24,401 --> 00:27:25,961
How is it?
- Great.

475
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:28,921
Advertise all over the city.
- Don't worry.

476
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:33,201
Jolly, where did she come from?

477
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:34,721
Pandey is with her.

478
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:41,641
Why did you do this to me?

479
00:27:48,681 --> 00:27:50,841
Why did you deceive me?

480
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:57,361
You should've taken pity
on my condition before lying to me.

481
00:27:58,761 --> 00:27:59,881
What are you saying, ma'am?

482
00:28:00,321 --> 00:28:02,201
Who deceived who?

483
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:04,241
He did!

484
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:10,441
Is this how you play
with people's lives?

485
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:14,681
Was I the only one you found?

486
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:19,961
They killed my husband.

487
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:23,641
For 8 months, I've been doing
the rounds of the court

488
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:25,801
in this condition! I'm tired.

489
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:31,841
You could've just
said no like others did.

490
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:35,761
I would've gone away.

491
00:28:38,361 --> 00:28:40,441
Look, you're mistaken.

492
00:28:40,641 --> 00:28:42,641
I don't understand
what you're saying.

493
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:45,201
Ask him!
Tell them.

494
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:46,721
Tell them the truth.

495
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:47,961
Tell them!

496
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,081
He took Rs. 2 lakh from
me using Mr. Rizvi's name.

497
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:52,881
And he has no clue.

498
00:28:56,641 --> 00:28:57,841
You want more, here take it.

499
00:28:58,161 --> 00:28:59,041
Take it

500
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:01,561
Take everything!
Everything!

501
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:01,561
Take everything!
Everything!

502
00:29:03,521 --> 00:29:06,801
Jolly! Do you know her?

503
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:09,601
I'm asking you, do you know her?

504
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:12,401
Yes, I do.

505
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:13,801
Did you take money from her?

506
00:29:14,081 --> 00:29:16,121
Yes, I did but I'll
pay her back in two days.

507
00:29:16,161 --> 00:29:17,561
I don't want your money.

508
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:20,881
I want justice!
Can you get me that?

509
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:22,441
Tell me, can you?

510
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:28,601
I never hurt you in any way.

511
00:29:29,441 --> 00:29:32,041
In fact, I never hurt anyone.

512
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:36,801
You took away whatever hope I had.

513
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:40,641
What will I do? Where will I go?

514
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:46,121
What are you all looking at?
Go away!

515
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,881
Come on, go!

516
00:30:20,281 --> 00:30:23,481
Hina, there you are, dear.

517
00:30:24,481 --> 00:30:26,401
I was looking for you downstairs.

518
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:28,841
Come down, dear.

519
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:32,041
I can't keep climbing
these stairs all day.

520
00:30:32,721 --> 00:30:33,841
Come on!

521
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:36,921
Come, dear.

522
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:39,161
Come on!

523
00:30:58,761 --> 00:30:59,601
Hina!

524
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:01,961
Hina!

525
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:08,761
Hina! Hina!

526
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:18,881
I refused to take Hina's
case in the first meeting!

527
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,721
And you kept siphoning
money from her in my name!

528
00:31:21,801 --> 00:31:24,521
You're responsible for
her death! You killed her!

529
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:28,321
Mr. Rizvi, I worked
under you for 30 years.

530
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:31,681
If I'd known that Jolly would..
- Really?

531
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:35,761
How do I believe that you didn't
have any clue about what he did?

532
00:31:35,841 --> 00:31:37,801
Mishra, his salary is
just Rs. 15,000!

533
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:39,641
He gets betel leaf
and kebabs for me.

534
00:31:39,961 --> 00:31:42,441
He even cleans my car.

535
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:45,321
And you thought he's
become a hot shot lawyer?

536
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,441
He'll sit in his own chamber?

537
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:48,361
He dares to match me!

538
00:31:48,561 --> 00:31:52,081
I apologise for his mistake,
Mr. Rizvi.

539
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:53,561
Please forgive him.

540
00:31:55,761 --> 00:31:57,041
I respect you.

541
00:31:57,281 --> 00:32:00,961
Before I call the police
and throw you two in jail

542
00:31:57,281 --> 00:32:00,961
Before I call the police
and throw you two in jail

543
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:02,281
get lost.

544
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:03,441
Out!

545
00:32:04,681 --> 00:32:05,721
Out!

546
00:32:09,121 --> 00:32:10,241
Jolly

547
00:32:12,561 --> 00:32:16,921
I worked here for 30 years.

548
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:18,161
30 years.

549
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:20,281
I couldn't become a lawyer like you.

550
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:23,481
But I had earned a lot of respect.

551
00:32:23,921 --> 00:32:28,201
And now you destroyed that as well.

552
00:32:32,361 --> 00:32:34,641
I made a mistake.
- No, son, I made a mistake.

553
00:32:35,241 --> 00:32:36,561
I made the mistake.

554
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:38,841
Now do me a favour

555
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:43,881
and don't show me
your wretched face again!

556
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:45,161
No, Father
- Don't show me your face again!

557
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:46,961
It was a mistake, Father.

558
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:03,801
Hina!

559
00:34:07,241 --> 00:34:10,521
Jolly?
What's wrong?

560
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:12,841
Did you dream about Hina again?

561
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:16,801
I'll get you water.

562
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:25,041
"I request you.."

563
00:34:25,081 --> 00:34:31,201
"Show me the right path now."

564
00:34:31,281 --> 00:34:35,881
I want justice! - "Roll my
heart and make a wick of it."

565
00:34:36,601 --> 00:34:42,921
"Light your lamp, O my guide."

566
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:54,681
"O remover of my obstacles,
O divine light."

567
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:58,361
"O powerful one."

568
00:34:58,761 --> 00:35:05,081
"O maker of fates, turn
my bad times into good."

569
00:34:58,761 --> 00:35:05,081
"O maker of fates, turn
my bad times into good."

570
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:11,401
"Show me that you
value my prayers."

571
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:18,001
"My life is in a big mess."

572
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:24,481
"Where shall I bow my head?
Show me a way out.."

573
00:35:24,521 --> 00:35:30,121
"O remover of my obstacles,
O divine light."

574
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:34,281
"O powerful one."

575
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:40,961
Sir..

576
00:35:41,601 --> 00:35:43,321
Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind!

577
00:35:44,481 --> 00:35:46,401
Where are you taking him, sir?

578
00:35:48,081 --> 00:35:49,601
Mr. Singh has set him free.

579
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,201
Iqbal! Congratulations, son.

580
00:36:00,761 --> 00:36:02,841
Your special bail has been approved.

581
00:36:03,321 --> 00:36:05,801
Get ready, we leave in a bit.

582
00:36:32,841 --> 00:36:34,521
Hina,
the wedding procession is here!

583
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:39,641
Look..

584
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:54,161
Mr. Iqbal Qasim, do you take

585
00:36:54,201 --> 00:36:56,401
Hina Siddiqui,
daughter of Zahur Ali Siddiqui

586
00:36:56,441 --> 00:37:01,641
as your lawfully wedded wife?

587
00:36:56,441 --> 00:37:01,641
as your lawfully wedded wife?

588
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:04,281
I do!
- Amen!

589
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:05,521
Amen! Amen! Amen!

590
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:07,001
Amen!

591
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:08,561
Do you accept?

592
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:11,441
I do.

593
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:14,161
Congratulations!
- Congratulations.

594
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:15,401
Look here.

595
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:17,161
Look in front.

596
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:28,641
What are you reading?

597
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:31,241
Your bail application.

598
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:34,041
I'll get bail easily,
you just wait and watch.

599
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:36,761
I've been arrested due
to some misunderstanding.

600
00:37:37,481 --> 00:37:39,001
And they are such nice people.

601
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:41,361
Bail for a wedding, who gets that?

602
00:37:42,641 --> 00:37:44,321
But we need to file an application.

603
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:47,401
I can't see you handcuffed anymore.

604
00:37:49,761 --> 00:37:51,361
Where are the handcuffs?
I don't see them.

605
00:37:51,681 --> 00:37:52,681
What's this?

606
00:37:54,161 --> 00:37:55,761
Where? I don't see them.

607
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:00,041
Where are the handcuffs?

608
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:00,041
Where are the handcuffs?

609
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:02,961
Where are they?

610
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:09,561
Trying to be clever? Huh?

611
00:39:00,201 --> 00:39:01,761
Jai Hind, sir.
- Where is he?

612
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,161
Sir, in the van.

613
00:39:03,681 --> 00:39:04,561
Bring him out.

614
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:07,481
Get him out.
- Okay, sir.

615
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:15,681
Sir.

616
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:19,641
Congratulations,
Iqbal Qadri.

617
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:21,241
Qadri?

618
00:39:21,681 --> 00:39:23,321
It's Iqbal Qasim, sir.

619
00:39:23,401 --> 00:39:25,801
Your wedding will be recorded
in the Guinness Book.

620
00:39:26,721 --> 00:39:28,921
Special bail for
marriage with handcuffs.

621
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:32,801
All thanks to you, Mr. Singh.

622
00:39:33,561 --> 00:39:36,801
Please sort this confusion out
and help me get bail.

623
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:38,481
Please, Mr. Singh.

624
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:58,001
Sir, let me congratulate you
in advance for another promotion.

625
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:07,761
What did you do?

626
00:40:08,761 --> 00:40:09,921
Sorry, Bhadoriya.

627
00:40:10,161 --> 00:40:12,041
You're going to retire
this month anyway.

628
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:14,521
You'll have enough time to recover.

629
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,321
And you'll get a fat compensation
for getting injured on duty.

630
00:40:18,361 --> 00:40:21,041
Yes. And even I'll send
something for you.

631
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:22,961
Siraj!
- Yes, sir.

632
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:24,281
Take him to the hospital.

633
00:40:25,681 --> 00:40:27,201
Put him in the van.
- Help me!

634
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:32,561
What is the name of the
lawyer who filed the PIL?

635
00:41:33,121 --> 00:41:35,761
Some Jagdishwar Mishra

636
00:41:35,801 --> 00:41:36,961
they call him Jolly.

637
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:38,481
Do you know him?

638
00:41:38,761 --> 00:41:40,641
No, never heard of him.

639
00:41:41,321 --> 00:41:45,441
What are the chances, Mr. Mathur?
- There's no case, Mr. Singh.

640
00:41:45,721 --> 00:41:48,801
An officer like you
should be awarded.

641
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,961
Instead, he'll make you
stand in the witness box?

642
00:41:51,161 --> 00:41:52,601
What am I here for?

643
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:56,121
Mr. Singh, you're an old friend.

644
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:59,241
Your case, is my case.

645
00:42:00,361 --> 00:42:02,361
Would you like me to
tear up this PIL right now?

646
00:42:02,441 --> 00:42:04,841
And that's exactly what
Justice Tripathi will do on day 1.

647
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:06,601
He'll tear it up and
throw it in the dustbin.

648
00:42:07,081 --> 00:42:10,161
Please excuse me,
I must leave for golf.

649
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:12,321
Mushtaq will explain
the rest to you.

650
00:42:12,361 --> 00:42:14,561
Just remember one thing.

651
00:42:14,641 --> 00:42:19,241
Don't allow any details,
documents or papers

652
00:42:19,321 --> 00:42:21,321
connected to this case to leak out.

653
00:42:21,641 --> 00:42:23,761
Keep the lid tight at your end.

654
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,681
We'll see who gets through.

655
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:28,041
Goodbye.

656
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:29,721
Mushtaq.

657
00:42:35,521 --> 00:42:37,321
Sir, this is the rate card.
- What is this?

658
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:40,881
It's a murder case so these are
all the package options. Look!

659
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:43,281
If you want to drag the case,
it'll be 1.5 million.

660
00:42:43,801 --> 00:42:45,801
To reduce your sentence,
it'll be 2.5 million.

661
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:47,841
And if you want to get acquitted,
it'll be five million.

662
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:49,761
Taxes are extra.

663
00:42:49,921 --> 00:42:52,161
You can select any package you like

664
00:42:52,241 --> 00:42:53,841
and we'll activate
that scheme, sir.

665
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:57,121
Which package did you like, sir?
- Five million.

666
00:42:57,401 --> 00:42:58,321
Thank you, sir.

667
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:02,081
Sir, your bill. Please pay in cash.

668
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:02,081
Sir, your bill. Please pay in cash.

669
00:43:02,801 --> 00:43:05,121
What is this?
- This is for your tea and biscuits.

670
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:08,081
Tea and biscuits as well.

671
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:09,681
There's nothing free
in this office, sir.

672
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,921
You've got a discount
because you're a cop.

673
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:14,241
That's why we haven't charged
you for the AC and fan.

674
00:43:14,641 --> 00:43:15,601
Have a nice day, sir.

675
00:43:30,801 --> 00:43:31,761
Good morning, sir.

676
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:33,641
Good morning.

677
00:43:34,801 --> 00:43:36,161
Good morning.

678
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:57,241
Yes, Om Prakash, show me.

679
00:43:59,441 --> 00:44:00,761
Please get some water.

680
00:43:59,441 --> 00:44:00,761
Please get some water.

681
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:04,401
Let's see.

682
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:44,121
Leave the chair and hold this,
Om Prakash.

683
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:51,961
Jagdishwar Mishra aka Jolly?

684
00:44:53,121 --> 00:44:54,081
Yes.

685
00:44:54,321 --> 00:44:57,721
Do you have
a brother in Delhi?

686
00:44:58,081 --> 00:44:59,201
No, sir. Why?

687
00:44:59,481 --> 00:45:00,401
Forget it.

688
00:44:59,481 --> 00:45:00,401
Forget it.

689
00:45:00,521 --> 00:45:04,321
Nothing. Your name reminded
me of another Jolly.

690
00:45:05,361 --> 00:45:06,801
So who's from defence?

691
00:45:08,001 --> 00:45:09,441
Mr. Pramod Mathur.

692
00:45:09,521 --> 00:45:11,361
He's on his way.
- On his way?

693
00:45:11,561 --> 00:45:12,721
Why didn't he come on time?

694
00:45:12,801 --> 00:45:14,561
I'm not used to coming on time.

695
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:17,281
And Lucknow court is
not known for its punctuality.

696
00:45:17,361 --> 00:45:18,401
So I was sitting in my car.

697
00:45:18,561 --> 00:45:22,361
Things always get done
on time in my court.

698
00:45:22,601 --> 00:45:24,801
Got it?
Don't forget next time.

699
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:29,161
It'll be good for both of us.
Sit.

700
00:45:29,921 --> 00:45:31,761
So, Mr. Jolly, please begin.

701
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:36,121
Sir, on 13th August, 2015, Inspector

702
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:41,281
Suryaveer Singh and his
team shot dead Iqbal Qasim

703
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,481
a resident of Lucknow,
in an encounter.

704
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:46,761
But we believe it's
a fake encounter

705
00:45:46,841 --> 00:45:49,241
and it calls for a
high-level investigation.

706
00:45:49,521 --> 00:45:52,641
Respected sir, the investigation
which he's demanding

707
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:54,281
has already been carried
out by the police department.

708
00:45:54,361 --> 00:45:55,481
And the outcome was

709
00:45:55,521 --> 00:45:59,441
Iqbal snatched constable Bhadoria's
service revolver

710
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:01,361
shot him and tried to escape.

711
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:01,361
shot him and tried to escape.

712
00:46:01,481 --> 00:46:04,401
The police, was forced
to take necessary action.

713
00:46:04,481 --> 00:46:06,921
Sir, there are many
loopholes in this story.

714
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:08,921
And it's not just about Iqbal, sir.

715
00:46:08,961 --> 00:46:12,281
Constable Baldev Singh Bhadoria's
death

716
00:46:12,321 --> 00:46:13,641
in this encounter
is also suspicious.

717
00:46:13,721 --> 00:46:16,321
Stop making such tall claims.

718
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:18,041
What are you trying to say?

719
00:46:18,121 --> 00:46:20,401
That the police shot
one of their own men?

720
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:22,961
No, sir, all I want to say is that

721
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:27,081
this case demands an unbiased
investigation. - Again!

722
00:46:27,401 --> 00:46:30,721
What do you want?
The investigation is already done.

723
00:46:30,801 --> 00:46:32,441
And why should we re-investigate?

724
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:35,241
This is like the story

725
00:46:35,281 --> 00:46:37,241
of the man who had nothing to do

726
00:46:37,281 --> 00:46:39,081
so he ripped his clothes
and stitched them repeatedly.

727
00:46:39,721 --> 00:46:41,161
These people have nothing to do.

728
00:46:41,241 --> 00:46:44,201
They just wake up
one day and file a PIL.

729
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:46,321
Yes, Sangeeta. Just a minute.

730
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:47,841
Yes, sweetheart.

731
00:46:48,201 --> 00:46:50,841
Did you like the dress?
It's nice, isn't it?

732
00:46:52,161 --> 00:46:54,441
Oh, come on,
not your Manish Malhotra again.

733
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:56,881
He's better, he's Harish Malhotra.

734
00:46:57,321 --> 00:46:59,601
Manish is famous in India.
Harish is famous in Lucknow.

735
00:46:59,681 --> 00:47:01,241
He's a top designer of Lucknow.

736
00:46:59,681 --> 00:47:01,241
He's a top designer of Lucknow.

737
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,561
You can make do.

738
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:04,681
Hello, hello.

739
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:13,281
Does anyone know Manish Malhotra?

740
00:47:13,921 --> 00:47:17,081
Mr. Mathur, how much do you
think a Manish Malhotra dress costs?

741
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,721
It's quite cheap around
Rs. 5 to 6 lakh.

742
00:47:18,841 --> 00:47:20,361
Oh, my God!

743
00:47:21,441 --> 00:47:23,961
That's the budget
for a whole wedding.

744
00:47:24,961 --> 00:47:26,721
To buy such an expensive dress

745
00:47:26,921 --> 00:47:29,561
I'll have to be reborn a
lawyer like you, in my next life.

746
00:47:30,321 --> 00:47:32,361
It's just not possible
on a judge's pay.

747
00:47:33,361 --> 00:47:34,321
Sir!

748
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:37,601
Sir, if we're done discussing
the wedding and the dress

749
00:47:37,681 --> 00:47:38,921
can I say something?

750
00:47:39,321 --> 00:47:42,361
Look, Mathur is absolutely right.

751
00:47:42,721 --> 00:47:43,721
You want an investigation

752
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:45,201
don't you?

753
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:46,361
So here's the investigative report.

754
00:47:46,561 --> 00:47:49,481
You can either accept this
or get me new evidence.

755
00:47:49,801 --> 00:47:54,441
Am I wrong? - No.
- Then stop posing like a hero.

756
00:47:54,601 --> 00:47:56,041
Go do your job.

757
00:47:56,401 --> 00:47:57,321
Adjourned!

758
00:48:03,201 --> 00:48:04,921
I didn't know you're a lawyer.

759
00:48:05,641 --> 00:48:08,081
I thought you're
Mr. Rizvi's secretary.

760
00:48:08,161 --> 00:48:09,401
Anyway, it's a good thing.

761
00:48:09,481 --> 00:48:11,081
But why so serious?

762
00:48:12,721 --> 00:48:14,281
Take it easy.

763
00:48:14,721 --> 00:48:16,721
Haven't you seen those
hoardings in Lucknow?

764
00:48:16,801 --> 00:48:17,761
They say..

765
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:20,601
Smile, you're in Lucknow.

766
00:48:20,761 --> 00:48:22,761
I will smile, Mr. Mathur.

767
00:48:23,521 --> 00:48:25,561
After I put your client in jail.

768
00:48:26,201 --> 00:48:27,921
You Kanpur folks.

769
00:48:28,881 --> 00:48:31,121
This is Lucknow.

770
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:34,561
We have a saying in Lucknow.

771
00:48:34,841 --> 00:48:37,081
It takes twenty years
to build a reputation

772
00:48:37,161 --> 00:48:39,721
and five minutes to ruin it.

773
00:48:40,561 --> 00:48:43,481
And I heard, you have even ruined
your father's.

774
00:48:46,441 --> 00:48:48,121
You be careful.

775
00:49:04,321 --> 00:49:07,321
Jolly, did the judge
accept the police report?

776
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,441
Of course.

777
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:12,201
Mr. Mathur is a senior lawyer and
the judge is practically new, so

778
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:13,561
he only listened to him.

779
00:49:13,641 --> 00:49:16,561
When I intervened,
he said stop being so dramatic.

780
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,961
Don't try to be a hero.

781
00:49:19,161 --> 00:49:21,401
Jolly, I think the judge
is involved with them.

782
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:23,561
Even I think so.

783
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:26,841
How's the curry?
- It's very tasty.

784
00:49:27,521 --> 00:49:29,681
I just love your cooking.

785
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:34,121
Tell me something, what
will happen at the next date?

786
00:49:34,521 --> 00:49:35,601
The judge is a grouch.

787
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,361
If I don't present any new evidence,
he will reject the PIL.

788
00:49:42,081 --> 00:49:43,081
Yeah, Birbal.

789
00:49:43,441 --> 00:49:48,441
There is a guy who can help us get
evidence. - Who is he?

790
00:49:48,721 --> 00:49:51,441
His name is Guruji.
Lives in Banaras.

791
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:52,561
Banaras?

792
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:55,361
What does he do there?
- I don't know for sure.

793
00:49:55,921 --> 00:49:59,161
But I heard he's in some
kind of cricket business.

794
00:49:59,521 --> 00:50:02,161
Bookie?
- We'll know when we get there.

795
00:49:59,521 --> 00:50:02,161
Bookie?
- We'll know when we get there.

796
00:50:02,241 --> 00:50:05,481
Shall we go?
- Of course.

797
00:50:05,761 --> 00:50:08,601
We leave in the morning,
okay. See you.

798
00:50:11,081 --> 00:50:13,921
Welcome to Banaras!

799
00:50:14,081 --> 00:50:18,041
Veiled Eleven vs. Burka Eleven.

800
00:50:18,121 --> 00:50:20,041
Indian Ladies League.

801
00:50:20,121 --> 00:50:24,161
Presented by Vishal Saris,
Prayag Pipes

802
00:50:24,281 --> 00:50:27,401
B-Tex ointment and LG Hing.

803
00:50:27,481 --> 00:50:29,841
The stake has been raised
to 2,50,000!

804
00:50:29,881 --> 00:50:32,121
And I request the people of Banaras

805
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:35,361
to bet with all their hearts.

806
00:50:35,561 --> 00:50:38,681
The match is in its final
and decisive moment.

807
00:50:38,761 --> 00:50:42,241
There's pin-drop silence.
- What is this place?

808
00:50:42,601 --> 00:50:45,121
And this guy is going to help us?
- 100 percent.

809
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:47,441
He was a police constable
for 40 years.

810
00:50:47,641 --> 00:50:51,241
He's a very resourceful man.
- Jaya and Hema are in a discussion!

811
00:50:51,321 --> 00:50:52,401
Amazing guy.

812
00:50:52,481 --> 00:50:56,241
Next ball by the priest's daughter.
- At the ladies stump.

813
00:50:56,521 --> 00:51:00,121
Shakeela Bano has hit that from the
middle stump all the way in the air.

814
00:50:56,521 --> 00:51:00,121
Shakeela Bano has hit that from the
middle stump all the way in the air.

815
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:06,081
Superb catch!

816
00:51:06,121 --> 00:51:10,161
And with that Veiled Eleven
has recorded

817
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:12,961
a historic win on this pious land.

818
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:14,601
Don't forget

819
00:51:14,721 --> 00:51:16,601
next Sunday

820
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:19,921
we have a superb match lined up.

821
00:51:20,561 --> 00:51:24,081
Moustache Eleven vs. Bearded Eleven!

822
00:51:24,201 --> 00:51:27,121
Yes, please come in large numbers

823
00:51:27,281 --> 00:51:30,161
and bet your heart out.

824
00:51:30,361 --> 00:51:32,801
Glory to..
- The Lord!

825
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:36,921
I don't get this business about the
Veiled Eleven and the Burka Eleven.

826
00:51:36,961 --> 00:51:39,961
The match is just
an excuse to make money.

827
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:44,361
But actually it's to explain
to the men on both sides

828
00:51:44,721 --> 00:51:47,681
that life without women
is meaningless. Get it?

829
00:51:47,761 --> 00:51:50,441
What brings you here?
- We're here on urgent work, sir.

830
00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:52,561
Come.
- Actually..

831
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:55,961
You see, sir,
it's a cop encounter case

832
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:59,081
and we can't find
a single piece of paper.

833
00:51:59,201 --> 00:52:02,761
Not even the FIR copy.
- It can't disappear.

834
00:51:59,201 --> 00:52:02,761
Not even the FIR copy.
- It can't disappear.

835
00:52:03,361 --> 00:52:05,921
Must be locked away in
one of the constable's cupboard.

836
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:09,841
Exactly, sir. We came here looking
for the key to that cupboard.

837
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:11,521
You came to the right place.

838
00:52:11,961 --> 00:52:14,721
It will require some money

839
00:52:15,281 --> 00:52:19,081
but I will give you the FIR
copy and the charge-sheet.

840
00:52:19,121 --> 00:52:21,361
The thing is we don't
have any money.

841
00:52:22,321 --> 00:52:23,801
Goddess Ganga is my witness.

842
00:52:23,881 --> 00:52:26,841
I don't even sneeze
without getting paid.

843
00:52:26,961 --> 00:52:30,561
Sir, we came to you hoping that..
- Unlike you

844
00:52:30,641 --> 00:52:33,681
I look before I leap.

845
00:52:33,801 --> 00:52:38,361
It takes courage to leap
before you look, sir.

846
00:52:40,481 --> 00:52:43,041
How much?
- Rs. 5 lakh.

847
00:52:44,641 --> 00:52:45,641
You'll get it.

848
00:52:46,201 --> 00:52:47,641
Where from Jolly?

849
00:52:48,161 --> 00:52:51,161
What's he doing?
- Jolly, one second.

850
00:52:53,081 --> 00:52:55,201
We're in Banaras after
a long time, Birbal.

851
00:52:55,801 --> 00:52:57,681
A dip in the Ganga

852
00:52:57,801 --> 00:53:00,161
might just cleanse me
of some of my sins.

853
00:52:57,801 --> 00:53:00,161
might just cleanse me
of some of my sins.

854
00:53:01,601 --> 00:53:04,041
Praise the Lord!

855
00:53:14,081 --> 00:53:15,481
If you could've waited
just a few more days.

856
00:53:15,921 --> 00:53:17,561
I would've got you
a better price.

857
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,881
No, Mr. Dubey, I can't wait anymore.

858
00:53:20,721 --> 00:53:23,321
You're selling the chamber
5 lakh cheaper.

859
00:53:24,241 --> 00:53:26,801
You can be anything, but a lawyer.

860
00:53:30,801 --> 00:53:32,561
I'm trying to be one.

861
00:53:33,801 --> 00:53:38,401
I would first like to question
Mr. Suryaveer Singh.

862
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,521
Mr. Suryaveer Singh.

863
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:42,281
Please come to the witness box.

864
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:55,601
Mr. Singh, please tell me,
why did you arrest Iqbal?

865
00:53:56,281 --> 00:53:57,401
We had information

866
00:53:57,481 --> 00:54:00,361
that he's associated with
some Kashmiri organisations.

867
00:53:57,481 --> 00:54:00,361
that he's associated with
some Kashmiri organisations.

868
00:54:00,561 --> 00:54:03,001
Who? Iqbal Qasim or Iqbal Qadri?

869
00:54:04,281 --> 00:54:06,801
They are the same,
they often operate under aliases.

870
00:54:07,761 --> 00:54:11,961
When you arrested Iqbal,
what did you recover from him?

871
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:13,881
A lot of material.
- What material?

872
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:17,801
A laptop, a pen-drive,
some secret documents

873
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:21,361
and objectionable literature,
like books and CDs.

874
00:54:21,441 --> 00:54:23,441
Do you remember the name
of any book?

875
00:54:26,201 --> 00:54:30,001
Huh? - Not now but there
were lots of books.

876
00:54:30,081 --> 00:54:31,121
Shall I help?

877
00:54:35,081 --> 00:54:36,001
Allow me.

878
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:42,521
Your Honour, the first dangerous
item recovered from Iqbal's home

879
00:54:42,921 --> 00:54:46,281
was the poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz's book.

880
00:54:46,481 --> 00:54:50,321
Along with a CD of
Ghulam Ali's poetry.

881
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:54,921
And the other objectionable
document is this map of India.

882
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:57,601
Your Honour, the third item

883
00:54:57,681 --> 00:55:00,921
which is actually dangerous
and will completely shock you

884
00:54:57,681 --> 00:55:00,921
which is actually dangerous
and will completely shock you

885
00:55:00,961 --> 00:55:05,961
is a book in Arabic, a translation
of another dangerous book

886
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:08,641
called the 'Bhagavad Gita'.

887
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:10,641
What are you saying?

888
00:55:10,961 --> 00:55:14,481
Why will the police call the 'Gita'
objectionable literature?

889
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,881
Mistakes are often committed
in haste, Your Honour.

890
00:55:16,961 --> 00:55:20,081
And he didn't factor that someday
it would be brought up in the court.

891
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:23,041
I would like to know the
source of this information.

892
00:55:23,441 --> 00:55:24,401
This.

893
00:55:25,681 --> 00:55:28,841
This is a copy of
the FIR and the charge-sheet.

894
00:55:29,001 --> 00:55:29,961
Take it.

895
00:55:30,601 --> 00:55:32,961
Along with this a report
that contains the list

896
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:36,601
of all the items
recovered from Iqbal.

897
00:55:36,681 --> 00:55:39,201
Please take a close look at the FIR
and

898
00:55:39,241 --> 00:55:43,961
you'll see how 'Qadri' is written
in front of Iqbal Qasim with 'aka'.

899
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:49,561
But, Jolly,
what does all this prove?

900
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:54,201
Just that the case made
against Iqbal lacks substance.

901
00:55:54,281 --> 00:55:56,201
Sooner or later this
would've been revealed

902
00:55:56,321 --> 00:55:58,841
and would've hampered the
promotion of some high-level people.

903
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,441
Right, Mr. Singh?

904
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,441
Right, Mr. Singh?

905
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:02,641
What do you think?

906
00:56:02,961 --> 00:56:05,681
Meet me outside,
I'll tell you what I think.

907
00:56:06,201 --> 00:56:08,481
Watch it, Mr. Singh.

908
00:56:09,401 --> 00:56:12,961
If I see even a hint of attitude,
I'll thrash you right here.

909
00:56:13,001 --> 00:56:16,441
Jolly. That's no way to talk.

910
00:56:16,681 --> 00:56:20,201
You've gone too far.

911
00:56:20,241 --> 00:56:21,241
Sorry, Your Honour.

912
00:56:22,401 --> 00:56:23,281
Jai Hind, sir.

913
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:25,361
Jai Hind, sir.
- He screamed, and you..

914
00:56:26,721 --> 00:56:27,721
Yes, Singh.

915
00:56:28,561 --> 00:56:30,641
Meet Mr. Basu and Mr. Nair

916
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:33,121
from the Central Bureau
of Investigation, New Delhi.

917
00:56:33,401 --> 00:56:34,601
They have a few questions

918
00:56:34,921 --> 00:56:37,121
about the Iqbal encounter
and constable

919
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:39,401
Baldev Singh Bhadoria's death.

920
00:56:39,801 --> 00:56:43,761
So, Mr. Singh, what information
did you have about Iqbal

921
00:56:43,881 --> 00:56:44,761
please tell us?

922
00:56:45,441 --> 00:56:48,761
Sir, we had intelligence inputs
from Srinagar Police and

923
00:56:48,921 --> 00:56:50,441
I had my own personal information.

924
00:56:50,521 --> 00:56:53,801
The intelligence report from
Srinagar was on Iqbal Qadri.

925
00:56:54,121 --> 00:56:57,161
And the person who was
shot dead was Iqbal Qasim.

926
00:56:57,801 --> 00:56:59,601
Even if we ignore this confusion

927
00:57:00,161 --> 00:57:01,041
still

928
00:57:02,361 --> 00:57:05,641
how do you explain constable
Baldev Singh Bhadoria's death?

929
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:10,161
Look, Mr. Basu, Singh is
one of our best officers.

930
00:57:10,241 --> 00:57:11,121
I'm sure.

931
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:15,321
I personally assure you that I will
conduct an internal inquiry.

932
00:57:15,801 --> 00:57:19,401
Until then, if you can
cooperate with us. Please!

933
00:57:23,281 --> 00:57:24,161
All right, Mr. Paul.

934
00:57:25,521 --> 00:57:27,041
We had different orders.

935
00:57:27,801 --> 00:57:31,521
But since you're insisting,
we'll wait for your report.

936
00:57:32,121 --> 00:57:33,001
Thank you.

937
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:45,721
I don't get it, sir.

938
00:57:46,681 --> 00:57:49,001
We were never questioned
about any of our encounters.

939
00:57:49,521 --> 00:57:50,441
Even by the CBI.

940
00:57:53,441 --> 00:57:54,681
How did this matter
get to Delhi?

941
00:57:55,241 --> 00:57:57,881
Must be someone on the inside
who tipped off the agency.

942
00:57:58,561 --> 00:58:02,601
You're to blame for this too.
You're a star now.

943
00:57:58,561 --> 00:58:02,601
You're to blame for this too.
You're a star now.

944
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:06,481
Your pictures are often in the
papers. What do they call you?

945
00:58:06,881 --> 00:58:08,841
Super-cop. Yeah.

946
00:58:09,921 --> 00:58:11,601
Lucknow's daredevil
who doesn't bother

947
00:58:12,721 --> 00:58:14,201
taking me in confidence either.

948
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:16,481
Everything else is fine

949
00:58:17,241 --> 00:58:19,801
but how will you explain
Bhadoria's death?

950
00:58:20,161 --> 00:58:23,041
Sir, I didn't know that
Bhadoria had heart trouble

951
00:58:23,921 --> 00:58:26,041
and that he was on blood thinners.
- I see.

952
00:58:26,321 --> 00:58:28,041
Otherwise, why would I, I mean..

953
00:58:29,841 --> 00:58:34,561
Anyway, this is not the
first complaint against you.

954
00:58:36,521 --> 00:58:38,921
It's an internal inquiry,
I'll see what I can do.

955
00:58:39,961 --> 00:58:40,881
You may leave.

956
00:58:42,521 --> 00:58:43,401
Sir.

957
00:58:45,081 --> 00:58:46,841
You knew, didn't you

958
00:58:47,201 --> 00:58:48,801
that Iqbal wasn't the
same man you were looking for?

959
00:58:50,521 --> 00:58:53,081
How much were you paid for
letting Iqbal Qadri go?

960
00:58:54,001 --> 00:58:55,161
What are you looking at?

961
00:58:55,881 --> 00:58:59,641
I'm your boss and nothing
is hidden from me.

962
00:59:00,201 --> 00:59:02,441
You're in a big hurry to
get promoted, aren't you?

963
00:59:02,961 --> 00:59:04,401
You don't care about the

964
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:08,601
innocent and the guilty.

965
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:12,681
This time you're
in deep trouble, Singh.

966
00:59:13,921 --> 00:59:18,521
Sir, my life's first
encounter was with you.

967
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:26,601
I learned from you that killing
someone can get me promoted.

968
00:59:30,161 --> 00:59:31,041
I'm like your son.

969
00:59:32,801 --> 00:59:34,041
Don't forget me now.

970
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:39,401
We'll be safe as long
as we're together.

971
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:43,921
Jai Hind.

972
00:59:57,241 --> 01:00:00,561
Mr. Zahur? - Yes?
- Greetings.

973
00:59:57,241 --> 01:00:00,561
Mr. Zahur? - Yes?
- Greetings.

974
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:05,161
I want to get some
clothes stitched.

975
01:00:05,801 --> 01:00:07,041
Come in,
let me take your measurements.

976
01:00:10,561 --> 01:00:12,721
Pardon me,
but the youngsters these days

977
01:00:13,561 --> 01:00:16,721
like to wear readymade clothes.

978
01:00:17,401 --> 01:00:19,401
What brought you
to this old tailor?

979
01:00:20,641 --> 01:00:22,401
I've heard there's
magic in your hands.

980
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:26,361
But my sight doesn't support
my hands anymore.

981
01:00:26,681 --> 01:00:27,801
Turn around.

982
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:32,401
What do you do, son?

983
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:36,761
I'm a lawyer.
My name's Jolly.

984
01:00:46,641 --> 01:00:48,201
Have you no shame?

985
01:00:49,401 --> 01:00:51,681
How dare you show your face
after everything you've done!

986
01:00:52,041 --> 01:00:54,521
Mr. Zahur,
I know you're angry.

987
01:00:56,081 --> 01:00:59,201
But I need your help
with Iqbal's case.

988
01:01:00,481 --> 01:01:03,521
Any information, has anyone
ever tried contacting you?

989
01:01:04,721 --> 01:01:05,641
Or have you heard anything?

990
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:08,961
I know the truth about the case,
sir.

991
01:01:09,921 --> 01:01:12,441
Iqbal's murderers must be punished.

992
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:14,881
And Hina?

993
01:01:16,401 --> 01:01:18,121
Who will punish Hina's murderer?

994
01:01:18,601 --> 01:01:19,881
I'm right here, sir.

995
01:01:21,881 --> 01:01:24,521
I won't try to justify my crime.

996
01:01:47,681 --> 01:01:48,921
A few days ago

997
01:01:49,961 --> 01:01:52,641
a young man came to
meet me from Jhansi.

998
01:01:53,521 --> 01:01:55,881
He said he's the
son of the constable

999
01:01:56,841 --> 01:01:59,001
who died that day with Iqbal.

1000
01:01:59,641 --> 01:02:01,921
He said his name was
Ramkumar Bhadoria.

1001
01:01:59,641 --> 01:02:01,921
He said his name was
Ramkumar Bhadoria.

1002
01:02:03,681 --> 01:02:07,361
He wrote his name and
address on a piece of paper.

1003
01:02:08,761 --> 01:02:09,641
This.

1004
01:02:18,961 --> 01:02:19,921
Thank you very much!

1005
01:02:28,001 --> 01:02:30,161
You're early today.

1006
01:02:31,321 --> 01:02:33,761
Why are you smiling?
Let's go eat.

1007
01:02:33,961 --> 01:02:36,441
Wait, I'll be right back.
- Why?

1008
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:41,281
It's my anniversary dress,
the sexy type. Gucci.

1009
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:42,601
Where did you get the money?

1010
01:02:42,921 --> 01:02:44,161
It's rented.

1011
01:02:45,921 --> 01:02:47,321
Why didn't you wear it at home?

1012
01:02:47,521 --> 01:02:50,041
Then the entire neighbourhood
would've followed me here.

1013
01:02:51,121 --> 01:02:52,681
I'll only take a minute.

1014
01:02:53,441 --> 01:02:55,921
Your eyes will pop out
when you see this dress.

1015
01:02:56,601 --> 01:02:59,081
Hurry up.
I've to leave for Jhansi.

1016
01:02:59,201 --> 01:03:01,321
Jhansi?
- Yes, I'll tell you later.

1017
01:02:59,201 --> 01:03:01,321
Jhansi?
- Yes, I'll tell you later.

1018
01:03:01,641 --> 01:03:03,161
You're always in a foul mood.

1019
01:03:10,481 --> 01:03:12,601
Hello. Birbal

1020
01:03:13,561 --> 01:03:15,001
meet me at the railway station.

1021
01:03:15,801 --> 01:03:17,361
Yes, meet me there,
I'll tell you everything.

1022
01:03:18,641 --> 01:03:23,041
Hello, sir. Have you ever
had our special chocolate?

1023
01:03:24,081 --> 01:03:26,681
Let's offer him some if he hasn't.

1024
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:31,961
Where are you running?

1025
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:37,081
Shoot him!
- Jolly!

1026
01:03:39,241 --> 01:03:41,041
Run! Come on, run!

1027
01:03:47,601 --> 01:03:49,641
Stop!
Stop, you bastard!

1028
01:03:52,921 --> 01:03:53,841
Pushpa!

1029
01:03:53,921 --> 01:03:56,441
Stop, you bastard!
- Pushpa!

1030
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:57,921
Jolly!

1031
01:04:01,521 --> 01:04:02,401
Help!

1032
01:04:03,081 --> 01:04:06,081
Help us! Help!

1033
01:05:34,921 --> 01:05:36,481
Pushpa.

1034
01:05:37,281 --> 01:05:38,321
Jolly!

1035
01:05:39,361 --> 01:05:41,521
What happened to Bhadoria's son?

1036
01:05:41,721 --> 01:05:44,721
Birbal's gone to Jhansi to get him.
- Okay.

1037
01:05:50,761 --> 01:05:53,081
Tomorrow onwards
you will carry this.

1038
01:05:54,681 --> 01:05:56,801
It's not funny,
I had my father send this.

1039
01:05:57,041 --> 01:06:00,081
If anyone threatens you again,
just shoot him.

1040
01:05:57,041 --> 01:06:00,081
If anyone threatens you again,
just shoot him.

1041
01:06:02,081 --> 01:06:03,601
Here's your patient.

1042
01:06:04,481 --> 01:06:05,521
Father-in-law!

1043
01:06:08,321 --> 01:06:09,921
Greetings, Father-in-law.
- Bless you.

1044
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:12,481
I stopped you from coming to see me

1045
01:06:12,521 --> 01:06:13,801
so you landed up in hospital

1046
01:06:14,001 --> 01:06:16,001
so that I would have to
come see you instead?

1047
01:06:16,841 --> 01:06:18,161
Do you know how difficult it is

1048
01:06:18,201 --> 01:06:20,561
to travel from Kanpur
to Lucknow at my age?

1049
01:06:21,201 --> 01:06:23,961
How much more are you
going to trouble me?

1050
01:06:24,561 --> 01:06:26,641
Forgive me, Father.

1051
01:06:43,201 --> 01:06:48,441
"My crazy heart is longing
for you."

1052
01:06:48,601 --> 01:06:53,841
"Even the eyes shower
like heavy rain."

1053
01:06:59,401 --> 01:07:04,641
"My crazy heart is longing
for you."

1054
01:06:59,401 --> 01:07:04,641
"My crazy heart is longing
for you."

1055
01:07:04,841 --> 01:07:09,801
"Even the eyes shower
like heavy rain."

1056
01:07:10,321 --> 01:07:15,681
"My life is incomplete
without you."

1057
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:22,521
"This world seems colourless
without you."

1058
01:07:22,521 --> 01:07:27,841
"My crazy heart is longing
for you."

1059
01:07:27,921 --> 01:07:33,441
"Even the eyes shower
like heavy rain."

1060
01:07:44,721 --> 01:07:50,121
"What kind of happiness is this?
Is it like wax?"

1061
01:07:50,161 --> 01:07:55,521
"It melted and started flowing
through my eyes."

1062
01:07:55,601 --> 01:08:00,881
"I have tied threads
of prayers."

1063
01:07:55,601 --> 01:08:00,881
"I have tied threads
of prayers."

1064
01:08:01,001 --> 01:08:06,321
"So that we never depart."

1065
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:11,161
"So that we never depart.."

1066
01:08:11,241 --> 01:08:16,641
"You took away a hundred troubles
that were over me."

1067
01:08:16,721 --> 01:08:22,561
"Even the eyes shower
like heavy rain."

1068
01:08:27,161 --> 01:08:30,921
'The sensational attack
on advocate Jagdishwar Mishra'

1069
01:08:30,961 --> 01:08:33,841
'has sparked internal conflicts
in the police department.'

1070
01:08:33,921 --> 01:08:37,521
'The police department has
suspended Inspector Suryaveer Singh'

1071
01:08:37,641 --> 01:08:40,201
'and tried to separate
itself from this matter.'

1072
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:43,721
I warned you not to do anything
without telling me.

1073
01:08:43,761 --> 01:08:45,921
So why did you get him shot?

1074
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:48,561
Mr. Singh, this is a court case.

1075
01:08:48,641 --> 01:08:51,081
Lawyers settle matters in court

1076
01:08:51,121 --> 01:08:54,801
not on the streets. - Then do
it! What are you waiting for?

1077
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:57,361
I lost my promotion and
the department suspended me.

1078
01:08:57,441 --> 01:08:59,321
My entire career is ruined.

1079
01:08:59,601 --> 01:09:00,961
And what did you do?

1080
01:08:59,601 --> 01:09:00,961
And what did you do?

1081
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:02,441
Let me tell you, Mr. Mathur

1082
01:09:02,601 --> 01:09:06,681
if I go down,
I'll take everyone with me.

1083
01:09:06,761 --> 01:09:08,961
I'm warning you!
- And who's going to believe you?

1084
01:09:09,841 --> 01:09:12,361
Don't forget that you're
a suspended police officer

1085
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,321
facing murder charges.

1086
01:09:14,561 --> 01:09:18,081
You're not some evangelist
who people will follow blindly.

1087
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:20,241
Now you listen carefully, Singh.

1088
01:09:20,321 --> 01:09:24,081
Neither your department nor
the government's going to save you.

1089
01:09:24,121 --> 01:09:25,521
You have only two choices.

1090
01:09:25,601 --> 01:09:27,961
First, Pramod Mathur and

1091
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:30,361
second, Pramod Mathur.

1092
01:09:30,481 --> 01:09:31,681
What do we do now, sir?

1093
01:09:31,961 --> 01:09:34,921
I'll smack your face!

1094
01:09:34,961 --> 01:09:36,441
You moron! Imbecile!

1095
01:09:36,561 --> 01:09:38,961
'What now?' How long have
you been working for me?

1096
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:40,441
8 years.
- 8 years

1097
01:09:40,521 --> 01:09:43,721
and yet you're nothing more
than a rate card bearing waiter!

1098
01:09:44,401 --> 01:09:45,961
'What do we do now?'

1099
01:09:47,401 --> 01:09:49,801
We'll do exactly what Jolly wants.

1100
01:09:50,401 --> 01:09:51,761
What's the name of that Jhansi guy?

1101
01:09:51,801 --> 01:09:53,401
The constable's son?
- Yeah.

1102
01:09:53,441 --> 01:09:54,521
Ramkumar Bhadoria.

1103
01:09:54,601 --> 01:09:56,281
Ramkumar Bhadoria

1104
01:09:56,681 --> 01:09:58,481
Let him come to court.

1105
01:09:58,521 --> 01:10:01,761
Let all the witnesses
against us come to court.

1106
01:09:58,521 --> 01:10:01,761
Let all the witnesses
against us come to court.

1107
01:10:01,801 --> 01:10:02,961
We'll deal with them.

1108
01:10:03,121 --> 01:10:05,241
What new formula is this,
Mr. Mathur?

1109
01:10:05,281 --> 01:10:08,481
Pepsi and Pramod never
reveal their formula.

1110
01:10:09,441 --> 01:10:11,201
Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

1111
01:10:15,241 --> 01:10:17,321
It's your government.

1112
01:10:17,401 --> 01:10:18,681
Decide carefully.

1113
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,041
See you later.

1114
01:10:21,361 --> 01:10:23,081
Okay, yes.

1115
01:10:24,961 --> 01:10:27,721
Hello, how are you?

1116
01:10:27,761 --> 01:10:28,681
What has the world come to

1117
01:10:28,761 --> 01:10:31,121
when lawyers like you
are getting shot?

1118
01:10:31,201 --> 01:10:34,161
There are rumours spreading
about you that

1119
01:10:34,281 --> 01:10:37,921
you have quit the case, want
to apologise and return to Kanpur.

1120
01:10:38,481 --> 01:10:41,201
Kanpur people never flee
from battle, Mr. Mathur.

1121
01:10:41,281 --> 01:10:42,881
And anyway, as long as
there are lawyers like you

1122
01:10:43,001 --> 01:10:46,921
lawyers like me are needed
to keep the balance.

1123
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:49,241
This is your problem, buddy.

1124
01:10:49,521 --> 01:10:52,961
I told you this is Lucknow,
discourtesy isn't tolerated here.

1125
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:56,841
You must speak with
manners and be civil.

1126
01:10:56,881 --> 01:10:58,681
'After you..'

1127
01:10:58,841 --> 01:10:59,761
Remember that

1128
01:10:59,841 --> 01:11:04,361
otherwise, you'll be tasting more
of Lucknow's special chocolate.

1129
01:10:59,841 --> 01:11:04,361
otherwise, you'll be tasting more
of Lucknow's special chocolate.

1130
01:11:05,001 --> 01:11:07,321
The day I lose my temper

1131
01:11:07,401 --> 01:11:11,881
I'll shove that
courtesy up your backside!

1132
01:11:11,921 --> 01:11:13,361
You won't be able to take
a dump or pass air.

1133
01:11:13,401 --> 01:11:17,881
And you can courteously ask
your assistant to get it out.

1134
01:11:21,161 --> 01:11:22,961
Mushtaq.
- Yes, sir.

1135
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:24,761
That's a good comeback,
note it down.

1136
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,481
It will come handy.

1137
01:11:41,641 --> 01:11:43,241
Jolly.

1138
01:11:44,081 --> 01:11:45,561
How are you?

1139
01:11:46,281 --> 01:11:47,801
Are you fine?

1140
01:11:47,961 --> 01:11:49,561
Yes, absolutely.
- Good!

1141
01:11:49,601 --> 01:11:52,281
Please sit.
Everyone, please take a seat.

1142
01:11:52,361 --> 01:11:54,841
No point showing such
respect for the law.

1143
01:11:54,881 --> 01:11:57,321
Most of you must have jumped
the red-light while coming here.

1144
01:11:58,161 --> 01:12:02,041
Mr. Mathur, your Lucknow is
really dangerous.

1145
01:11:58,161 --> 01:12:02,041
Mr. Mathur, your Lucknow is
really dangerous.

1146
01:12:02,081 --> 01:12:06,121
Isn't it? I mean, people
get shot in broad daylight.

1147
01:12:06,161 --> 01:12:08,601
Even judges aren't spared here.

1148
01:12:08,641 --> 01:12:12,201
One of his clients hurled
a shoe at a judge.

1149
01:12:12,441 --> 01:12:15,001
Mr. Mathur, that's not right!

1150
01:12:15,041 --> 01:12:18,361
I mean, you should have
told me this before.

1151
01:12:18,401 --> 01:12:20,241
I would've arranged
for proper security.

1152
01:12:20,321 --> 01:12:22,641
Om Prakash.
Naik, listen.

1153
01:12:22,761 --> 01:12:24,361
Put up a notice outside

1154
01:12:24,401 --> 01:12:27,481
that no one will wear shoes
inside the courtroom.

1155
01:12:27,521 --> 01:12:28,521
Get it?

1156
01:12:28,641 --> 01:12:30,881
You never know when
someone's in a bad mood

1157
01:12:30,921 --> 01:12:32,201
and might bring
a bomb in his shoes.

1158
01:12:32,201 --> 01:12:33,201
He may have fought with his wife.

1159
01:12:33,241 --> 01:12:35,681
And might hurl it at the judge.
Right?

1160
01:12:35,721 --> 01:12:38,961
Your Honour, we would like to..
- Just a minute, Mr. Jolly.

1161
01:12:39,441 --> 01:12:40,401
Just..

1162
01:12:44,601 --> 01:12:48,521
One, two, three

1163
01:12:48,881 --> 01:12:52,441
four and five.

1164
01:12:53,321 --> 01:12:57,161
You see, the case has now heated up.

1165
01:12:57,481 --> 01:13:01,161
So this is for my self-defence.
Please don't mind.

1166
01:12:57,481 --> 01:13:01,161
So this is for my self-defence.
Please don't mind.

1167
01:13:01,841 --> 01:13:04,481
Yes, Mr. Jolly, please begin.
- Yes.

1168
01:13:04,561 --> 01:13:08,081
Sir, we want to record late police
constable Baldev Bhadoria's son

1169
01:13:08,161 --> 01:13:10,961
Ramkumar Bhadoria's statement.

1170
01:13:11,241 --> 01:13:13,281
We've already submitted
an advance notice, sir.

1171
01:13:14,761 --> 01:13:15,801
Yes.

1172
01:13:18,881 --> 01:13:23,081
Please tell the judge
about your father's death.

1173
01:13:24,561 --> 01:13:25,801
Sir

1174
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:29,721
my family lives in Jhansi.

1175
01:13:29,801 --> 01:13:32,481
But back then I was with my father,
in Lucknow.

1176
01:13:32,561 --> 01:13:34,241
He was on night duty.

1177
01:13:34,721 --> 01:13:35,961
Around 7 in the morning

1178
01:13:35,961 --> 01:13:37,841
I received a call
from the hospital

1179
01:13:38,161 --> 01:13:42,521
informing me that
my father was injured.

1180
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:45,801
I went over. When I arrived

1181
01:13:45,881 --> 01:13:48,761
I learned that
my father had been shot.

1182
01:13:49,401 --> 01:13:51,161
I was really scared.

1183
01:13:51,361 --> 01:13:53,841
It was a tense situation.

1184
01:13:53,961 --> 01:13:55,961
Everyone was pacing around, worried.

1185
01:13:56,121 --> 01:13:57,641
They were whispering
amongst themselves

1186
01:13:57,721 --> 01:13:59,881
but telling me nothing.

1187
01:13:59,961 --> 01:14:01,921
So I couldn't take it anymore.

1188
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:06,961
When I came out,
I met ASI Siraj Alam.

1189
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:11,121
I asked him to tell me what's wrong.

1190
01:14:11,241 --> 01:14:13,521
Mr. Singh accidentally
shot him in the leg.

1191
01:14:13,681 --> 01:14:15,561
He's lost a lot of blood
but he will be fine.

1192
01:14:15,641 --> 01:14:17,041
Your Honour, please note that

1193
01:14:17,081 --> 01:14:19,521
the police investigation claims

1194
01:14:19,681 --> 01:14:22,961
that Iqbal shot
constable Bhadoria.

1195
01:14:23,081 --> 01:14:27,041
But ASI Siraj Alam
personally told Ramkumar

1196
01:14:27,161 --> 01:14:30,241
that Inspector Singh
shot the constable.

1197
01:14:30,681 --> 01:14:31,921
That's all, Your Honour.

1198
01:14:31,961 --> 01:14:34,841
Mr. Mathur, your witness please.

1199
01:14:42,241 --> 01:14:44,681
Your Honour, according to
the police investigation

1200
01:14:44,841 --> 01:14:47,201
Siraj Alam and the
rest of the police team

1201
01:14:47,321 --> 01:14:48,961
never met Ramkumar that day.

1202
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:53,161
That's why this statement
sounds like a movie plot to me.

1203
01:14:53,921 --> 01:14:57,881
But I would like to
take this a little further.

1204
01:14:58,321 --> 01:15:02,281
Ramkumar,
please tell the respected judge

1205
01:14:58,321 --> 01:15:02,281
Ramkumar,
please tell the respected judge

1206
01:15:02,321 --> 01:15:05,241
about the compensation
that your family

1207
01:15:05,401 --> 01:15:06,561
received after your father's death.

1208
01:15:06,681 --> 01:15:08,281
I object, Your Honour!

1209
01:15:09,401 --> 01:15:11,641
Young man,
this is just my first question.

1210
01:15:11,761 --> 01:15:12,801
And you're already objecting.

1211
01:15:12,921 --> 01:15:15,321
I have 20 years of practice.

1212
01:15:15,601 --> 01:15:17,921
I won't beat around
the bush like you.

1213
01:15:17,961 --> 01:15:20,121
I'll be blunt and frank.

1214
01:15:20,161 --> 01:15:22,161
Yes, Ramkumar, how much
compensation did you get?

1215
01:15:22,561 --> 01:15:24,681
Well.. Rs. 5 lakh.

1216
01:15:24,761 --> 01:15:27,121
Rs. 5 lakh. What else?

1217
01:15:27,161 --> 01:15:30,561
A job with UP Roadways
as a conductor.

1218
01:15:30,681 --> 01:15:34,921
Why don't you be clear? You got
this job on police recommendation

1219
01:15:35,041 --> 01:15:39,001
because your father died
in the line of duty!

1220
01:15:39,721 --> 01:15:41,281
Yes, sir.
- Am I right?

1221
01:15:41,441 --> 01:15:45,081
And now you're accusing
that same police department

1222
01:15:45,161 --> 01:15:48,761
of murdering your father.

1223
01:15:49,241 --> 01:15:50,481
Amazing..

1224
01:15:50,561 --> 01:15:53,481
Wasn't the compensation
and job enough for you

1225
01:15:53,561 --> 01:15:55,721
that you're lying to get more?

1226
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,401
Your Honour,
the witness is being pressurised!

1227
01:15:57,521 --> 01:16:01,441
He is not lying.
- Every word is a lie, Your Honour.

1228
01:15:57,521 --> 01:16:01,441
He is not lying.
- Every word is a lie, Your Honour.

1229
01:16:01,601 --> 01:16:03,081
And if he's telling the truth

1230
01:16:03,281 --> 01:16:05,881
tell him to return
the compensation and quit his job.

1231
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:10,281
How long will you live off a gift
given by your father's murderers?

1232
01:16:10,401 --> 01:16:14,321
Sir, the witness is the sole
breadwinner of a family of eight.

1233
01:16:14,481 --> 01:16:17,161
This isn't just a question
of compensation or a job.

1234
01:16:17,401 --> 01:16:19,081
Mr. Mathur has nothing to say

1235
01:16:19,201 --> 01:16:20,881
so he's just making a
mountain out of a molehill.

1236
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:23,921
That's exactly what I get paid for.
- Hear that, sir!

1237
01:16:24,081 --> 01:16:25,801
Making a mountain
out of a molehill

1238
01:16:25,921 --> 01:16:29,081
is how I have become the
best lawyer in Lucknow.

1239
01:16:29,121 --> 01:16:30,921
With hard work and determination.

1240
01:16:30,921 --> 01:16:32,961
I don't come from a legacy
of court secretaries!

1241
01:16:33,041 --> 01:16:36,201
Sir, I won't tolerate
any personal comments.

1242
01:16:36,241 --> 01:16:37,961
Mr. Mathur,
no personal comments please.

1243
01:16:38,081 --> 01:16:39,241
Mr. Mathur..
- What personal comments?

1244
01:16:39,281 --> 01:16:40,881
Everything I'm saying is true!

1245
01:16:40,921 --> 01:16:42,241
Wasn't your father a secretary?

1246
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:43,601
Was he the Chief Justice of India?
- Listen to me.

1247
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:46,601
Sir, please ask him to shut up, or..
- Or what?

1248
01:16:46,681 --> 01:16:50,881
You think you can take me on in
those torn shoes and cheap clothes?

1249
01:16:50,961 --> 01:16:52,241
Please stop him, that's enough!

1250
01:16:52,401 --> 01:16:53,561
I'm trying!

1251
01:16:53,601 --> 01:16:54,801
Mr. Mathur, please be polite.

1252
01:16:54,841 --> 01:16:56,561
Your Honour,
to hell with politeness.

1253
01:16:56,681 --> 01:16:58,161
I want to know what you'll do.

1254
01:16:58,201 --> 01:16:59,961
Sir, stop him or else,
I'll end up doing something.

1255
01:17:00,081 --> 01:17:02,441
Mr. Mathur, Jolly, please don't
do this. - What will you do?

1256
01:17:02,481 --> 01:17:04,081
I've seen this before.

1257
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:05,281
What happened to your enthusiasm?

1258
01:17:05,401 --> 01:17:06,961
Look here..
- You damn secretary!

1259
01:17:07,121 --> 01:17:08,761
What happened to your enthusiasm?

1260
01:17:09,321 --> 01:17:11,681
What are you doing!
- Bloody Mathur!

1261
01:17:11,721 --> 01:17:14,601
How dare you touch me!
You..

1262
01:17:14,681 --> 01:17:16,361
Stop it!

1263
01:17:16,441 --> 01:17:18,521
There will be bloodshed!

1264
01:17:18,641 --> 01:17:20,201
Order! Order!

1265
01:17:20,281 --> 01:17:22,401
Sir..
- Everyone sit down!

1266
01:17:22,521 --> 01:17:25,121
Call the boys.

1267
01:17:25,201 --> 01:17:28,121
He hit Mr. Mathur!
He hit Mr. Mathur!

1268
01:17:28,241 --> 01:17:31,921
I'm trying to speak, let me.
They don't let me speak!

1269
01:17:31,961 --> 01:17:33,841
I'm standing here. Listen!

1270
01:17:34,001 --> 01:17:38,641
He hit Mr. Mathur!
I will not spare him today..

1271
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:40,641
Where are you going with the gun?

1272
01:17:40,881 --> 01:17:42,761
He's got a gun!

1273
01:17:42,921 --> 01:17:44,521
They've got a gun!

1274
01:17:44,561 --> 01:17:45,961
Call the police!

1275
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,201
Take the gavel, sir.
- They've brought a rifle

1276
01:17:48,241 --> 01:17:49,801
and you're handing me the gavel!

1277
01:17:49,881 --> 01:17:51,081
Give it to me!

1278
01:17:51,401 --> 01:17:55,201
Listen here! Order! Order!

1279
01:17:55,361 --> 01:17:57,041
Police!

1280
01:17:57,121 --> 01:17:58,361
Go home?

1281
01:17:58,441 --> 01:18:00,521
SP, I'm not going to step
out of this room

1282
01:17:58,441 --> 01:18:00,521
SP, I'm not going to step
out of this room

1283
01:18:00,641 --> 01:18:02,201
and you're advising
me to go home.

1284
01:18:02,921 --> 01:18:04,721
What do you mean by
nothing happened?

1285
01:18:04,841 --> 01:18:06,721
They brought a double-barrel
gun to my courtroom.

1286
01:18:06,761 --> 01:18:08,441
Should I wait for them
to fire a few rounds?

1287
01:18:08,641 --> 01:18:10,841
Look, sir, please. I request you

1288
01:18:10,921 --> 01:18:13,921
please send some security.
I'm not stepping out of the court.

1289
01:18:13,961 --> 01:18:16,801
Yes.
- Sir, I apologise.

1290
01:18:16,881 --> 01:18:18,201
No!

1291
01:18:18,401 --> 01:18:21,241
I apologise to both of you.

1292
01:18:21,401 --> 01:18:23,281
Forgive me, Jolly,
it was my fault.

1293
01:18:24,561 --> 01:18:26,361
I'm a heart patient.

1294
01:18:26,801 --> 01:18:28,761
My daughter's getting
married next month

1295
01:18:28,841 --> 01:18:32,681
and you two were hurling chairs
at me. - I'm extremely sorry

1296
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,361
but he started it.

1297
01:18:34,401 --> 01:18:37,601
You provoked him first, Mr. Mathur.
Right?

1298
01:18:37,681 --> 01:18:38,961
But, it's okay

1299
01:18:39,041 --> 01:18:40,321
you're senior.

1300
01:18:40,361 --> 01:18:45,161
Jolly, you apologise to him.
- Why should I apologise?

1301
01:18:45,201 --> 01:18:47,801
I didn't do anything wrong.
- You didn't?

1302
01:18:47,881 --> 01:18:49,521
You slapped him in court!

1303
01:18:49,561 --> 01:18:51,521
What's next! A bomb under his seat?

1304
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:54,481
Your Honour,
I don't want any apologies.

1305
01:18:54,561 --> 01:18:56,721
Let's continue with
the court proceedings.

1306
01:18:56,841 --> 01:18:58,561
I haven't finished
my cross-examination yet..

1307
01:18:58,681 --> 01:19:02,601
Look, Mr. Mathur.
I'm not that stupid.

1308
01:18:58,681 --> 01:19:02,601
Look, Mr. Mathur.
I'm not that stupid.

1309
01:19:02,641 --> 01:19:04,641
I may look like, but I'm not.

1310
01:19:04,721 --> 01:19:06,201
I won't start the proceedings yet.

1311
01:19:06,281 --> 01:19:08,801
What if someone brings
a cannon to my courtroom next?

1312
01:19:08,841 --> 01:19:11,481
Fine, sir. Let's continue
with the proceedings right here.

1313
01:19:11,521 --> 01:19:13,041
We have that provision as well, sir.

1314
01:19:13,161 --> 01:19:17,401
I demand Ramkumar's narco test.
- No!

1315
01:19:17,441 --> 01:19:18,881
There will be no narco test.

1316
01:19:18,961 --> 01:19:21,041
No narco test. I mean it!

1317
01:19:21,081 --> 01:19:21,961
This is wrong.

1318
01:19:22,121 --> 01:19:24,681
That boy's telling the truth.
- He's telling the truth, isn't he?

1319
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:26,121
So what's your problem?

1320
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:27,481
Let them do the narco test.

1321
01:19:27,561 --> 01:19:28,441
He's telling the truth, and

1322
01:19:28,521 --> 01:19:29,721
that's what he'll do
in the narco test.

1323
01:19:29,841 --> 01:19:31,961
But..
- No, Jolly, don't interfere.

1324
01:19:32,041 --> 01:19:34,361
Jolly, please, don't interfere now.

1325
01:19:34,401 --> 01:19:37,281
Look, I'm not going to resume
the session anytime soon.

1326
01:19:37,401 --> 01:19:39,401
This is better, let this case
get settled outside the court.

1327
01:19:39,521 --> 01:19:42,001
Take this away, Om Prakash,
it's not a cap.

1328
01:19:42,041 --> 01:19:44,641
Get some ice in it!
- Yes, sir.

1329
01:19:44,721 --> 01:19:48,041
Okay, goodbye.
- Bye.

1330
01:19:48,681 --> 01:19:50,921
Your Honour..
- Goodbye, Jolly. You can leave now.

1331
01:19:50,961 --> 01:19:52,281
Please.

1332
01:19:55,801 --> 01:19:58,361
Did you go to the Himalayas
to get the ice?

1333
01:19:58,561 --> 01:20:00,321
What's your full name?

1334
01:19:58,561 --> 01:20:00,321
What's your full name?

1335
01:20:00,361 --> 01:20:03,961
It's Ramkumar Bhadoria.

1336
01:20:04,121 --> 01:20:05,041
Right.

1337
01:20:05,121 --> 01:20:09,241
What did you see when
you got to the hospital?

1338
01:20:09,361 --> 01:20:10,961
What did you find?

1339
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:15,481
I..
- Don't sleep.

1340
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:18,961
What did you find?
- I saw that

1341
01:20:19,241 --> 01:20:23,161
my father had been shot by Singh.

1342
01:20:24,001 --> 01:20:26,601
Did ASI Siraj Alam tell you

1343
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:29,881
that Mr. Singh shot your father?

1344
01:20:30,161 --> 01:20:32,561
Yes, ma'am. He told me.

1345
01:20:33,281 --> 01:20:35,961
Who asked you to testify in court?

1346
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:38,881
Stop! Stop! Stop! Yes.

1347
01:20:39,041 --> 01:20:40,321
Let's take it from here.

1348
01:20:40,401 --> 01:20:44,481
Who asked you to give a
false testimony in court?

1349
01:20:45,081 --> 01:20:46,921
Yes, sir.
The recording is in progress.

1350
01:20:46,961 --> 01:20:51,081
'Who asked you to give a
false testimony in court?'

1351
01:20:51,481 --> 01:20:52,561
Open your eyes..

1352
01:20:52,721 --> 01:20:54,401
Answer me.

1353
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:56,441
Ma'am..

1354
01:20:57,521 --> 01:21:00,441
'Jagdishwar Mishra. Jolly.'

1355
01:20:57,521 --> 01:21:00,441
'Jagdishwar Mishra. Jolly.'

1356
01:21:00,601 --> 01:21:03,161
'Jolly asked me to..'

1357
01:21:03,281 --> 01:21:05,921
No, Your Honour, this is..

1358
01:21:08,481 --> 01:21:11,001
Sir. They changed the questions!
- Sit down.

1359
01:21:11,081 --> 01:21:13,961
Yes, Jolly, please speak.

1360
01:21:14,081 --> 01:21:17,241
Your Honour, this is a lie.
It's a conspiracy against me.

1361
01:21:17,281 --> 01:21:20,201
Someone's tampered with
the test you just saw, Your Honour.

1362
01:21:20,681 --> 01:21:24,321
The truth can't stay
hidden for long, sir.

1363
01:21:24,361 --> 01:21:26,681
He tried but got exposed.

1364
01:21:26,721 --> 01:21:28,721
I apologise for the interruption.

1365
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:32,121
Sir, please believe me,
I would never do such a thing.

1366
01:21:32,201 --> 01:21:33,881
I know everything.

1367
01:21:33,961 --> 01:21:37,481
'Sunder Lal Tripathi.'
Do you think I'm clueless in court?

1368
01:21:37,521 --> 01:21:38,321
Right, Mr. Mathur?

1369
01:21:38,321 --> 01:21:41,641
I'm sure you know what
the lawyers of Lucknow call me

1370
01:21:41,761 --> 01:21:44,481
outside of court.
Teddy bear, right?

1371
01:21:44,561 --> 01:21:48,601
Because I'm jovial, right?

1372
01:21:48,921 --> 01:21:50,601
You think, I can't see?

1373
01:21:50,641 --> 01:21:53,001
And I'm blind?

1374
01:21:53,161 --> 01:21:55,961
No, sir!
- No. I see everything.

1375
01:21:56,121 --> 01:21:59,081
I'm sorry that you got shot.

1376
01:21:59,161 --> 01:22:00,681
You have my sympathy.

1377
01:21:59,161 --> 01:22:00,681
You have my sympathy.

1378
01:22:00,761 --> 01:22:02,321
But I cannot ignore

1379
01:22:02,361 --> 01:22:06,201
your illegal actions
in the courtroom.

1380
01:22:06,481 --> 01:22:08,961
I sentence Ramkumar Bhadoria to

1381
01:22:09,081 --> 01:22:13,721
three months of judicial
custody for lying in court.

1382
01:22:13,841 --> 01:22:16,841
Sir.. - You want the compensation,
the job

1383
01:22:16,921 --> 01:22:18,921
and you want to lie
in my courtroom?

1384
01:22:19,041 --> 01:22:22,161
No, sir! - Take him away
before I get him flogged.

1385
01:22:22,281 --> 01:22:25,801
Sir, you're
punishing an innocent man!

1386
01:22:25,881 --> 01:22:28,281
You're not innocent either,
Mr. Jolly.

1387
01:22:28,321 --> 01:22:31,201
I've heard a lot about you.

1388
01:22:31,241 --> 01:22:35,041
And so, under CRPC section 340

1389
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:37,201
I order an inquiry against you

1390
01:22:37,321 --> 01:22:40,361
for presenting a
bogus witness in court.

1391
01:22:40,481 --> 01:22:42,481
And I recommend the BAR Council

1392
01:22:42,561 --> 01:22:46,721
that they cancel your license
as soon as they can.

1393
01:22:47,281 --> 01:22:48,481
Adjourned!

1394
01:22:57,721 --> 01:22:58,961
Now

1395
01:23:00,081 --> 01:23:04,881
who shoved courtesy
up whose backside?

1396
01:23:05,881 --> 01:23:07,761
Did you understand?

1397
01:23:11,641 --> 01:23:13,041
Move aside!

1398
01:23:13,761 --> 01:23:15,321
Move aside!

1399
01:23:15,841 --> 01:23:19,521
Give way!

1400
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:25,761
Jolly, there's bad news.

1401
01:23:26,281 --> 01:23:29,841
The chairman of the BAR
Council's Discipline Committee is

1402
01:23:29,881 --> 01:23:31,161
Mr. Rizvi.

1403
01:23:32,481 --> 01:23:34,081
Hello, sir.

1404
01:23:34,201 --> 01:23:36,961
Hello, sir!

1405
01:23:40,881 --> 01:23:42,481
This committee

1406
01:23:42,961 --> 01:23:47,761
finds Jagdishwar Mishra
aka Jolly guilty

1407
01:23:47,761 --> 01:23:49,401
of assaulting a fellow lawyer

1408
01:23:49,481 --> 01:23:54,081
and presenting a
bogus witness in court

1409
01:23:54,281 --> 01:23:58,161
and decides to
cancel his license.

1410
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:07,721
And according to the association's
rules, the committee also

1411
01:24:07,761 --> 01:24:10,841
gives Jolly four days

1412
01:24:11,401 --> 01:24:14,281
to prove his innocence.

1413
01:24:14,361 --> 01:24:16,041
This is wrong, Mr. Rizvi!

1414
01:24:16,081 --> 01:24:19,841
You should cancel his license
immediately! - Listen.

1415
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:22,881
We receive complaints
against many lawyers.

1416
01:24:22,921 --> 01:24:25,601
If we start cancelling
licenses immediately

1417
01:24:25,641 --> 01:24:30,041
pardon me, but only
typewriters will be left in court

1418
01:24:30,161 --> 01:24:31,441
and no lawyers.

1419
01:24:33,521 --> 01:24:34,681
Mr. Rizvi!

1420
01:24:34,721 --> 01:24:36,841
Mr. Rizvi! Mr. Rizvi!

1421
01:24:38,401 --> 01:24:40,441
We'll see you at the chamber.
- Yes, sir.

1422
01:24:41,241 --> 01:24:45,281
Mr. Rizvi, thank you
for giving me the four days.

1423
01:24:45,321 --> 01:24:48,281
What you're doing
takes a lot of courage.

1424
01:24:48,961 --> 01:24:53,161
If I had shown the courage
to take on the system

1425
01:24:54,121 --> 01:24:57,001
maybe Hina would still be alive.

1426
01:25:00,681 --> 01:25:02,361
All the best.

1427
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:15,481
They look so happy.

1428
01:25:16,441 --> 01:25:18,561
This reminds me of our wedding.

1429
01:25:20,521 --> 01:25:24,801
Jolly, will any
of the cops speak in our favour?

1430
01:25:25,881 --> 01:25:29,081
No, they are
all on Mathur's side.

1431
01:25:29,721 --> 01:25:31,281
All five?

1432
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:33,281
Hmm.

1433
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:36,961
There are four, not five.
- Four?

1434
01:25:38,281 --> 01:25:39,681
There are five in this picture.

1435
01:25:41,361 --> 01:25:42,601
Five?

1436
01:25:43,961 --> 01:25:45,441
How can there be five?

1437
01:25:46,081 --> 01:25:47,801
Yes, there are five.

1438
01:25:49,041 --> 01:25:50,961
This guy with the beard.

1439
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:54,881
Who is this guy?

1440
01:25:58,561 --> 01:26:00,641
That's Baldev Singh Bhadoria.

1441
01:25:58,561 --> 01:26:00,641
That's Baldev Singh Bhadoria.

1442
01:26:00,761 --> 01:26:02,121
That's Siraj Alam.

1443
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:04,441
That's Vinod Tiwari.

1444
01:26:04,681 --> 01:26:08,281
And that bald one
is Sanjay Srivastav.

1445
01:26:08,321 --> 01:26:09,961
Bhadoria's dead.

1446
01:26:09,961 --> 01:26:12,561
These three are on their side, so

1447
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:15,641
who is this fifth bearded guy?

1448
01:26:15,961 --> 01:26:20,241
Hold on.
- You know, he looks different.

1449
01:26:20,481 --> 01:26:22,841
Even his uniform is different.

1450
01:26:34,121 --> 01:26:36,481
What's that written
on his shoulder?

1451
01:26:36,561 --> 01:26:38,321
'J&K Police.'

1452
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:41,761
Kashmir Police?
But what was he doing here?

1453
01:26:43,001 --> 01:26:45,801
That intelligence report
was sent from Kashmir, right?

1454
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:53,201
What's his name? Wait a minute.

1455
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:54,601
Hold this..

1456
01:26:56,401 --> 01:26:57,601
Show me.

1457
01:26:59,201 --> 01:27:00,721
'Fahim Butt.'

1458
01:26:59,201 --> 01:27:00,721
'Fahim Butt.'

1459
01:27:01,481 --> 01:27:02,721
Fahim Butt?

1460
01:27:04,641 --> 01:27:06,281
Kashmir Police?

1461
01:27:09,921 --> 01:27:11,641
I must go to Kashmir.

1462
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:18,681
What do we want?
- Justice.

1463
01:27:18,721 --> 01:27:20,961
We want..
- Justice!

1464
01:27:21,041 --> 01:27:23,041
Give us..
- Justice!

1465
01:27:23,121 --> 01:27:25,321
If I'm martyred..
- Justice!

1466
01:27:25,441 --> 01:27:27,401
We want..
- Justice!

1467
01:27:27,481 --> 01:27:29,361
Give us..
- Justice!

1468
01:27:29,401 --> 01:27:31,321
We want..
- Justice!

1469
01:27:31,361 --> 01:27:33,521
This land calls for..
- Justice!

1470
01:27:33,561 --> 01:27:35,601
These mountains call for..
- Justice!

1471
01:27:35,681 --> 01:27:37,561
Say it aloud.
- Justice!

1472
01:27:37,641 --> 01:27:39,241
Raise your hands and say!
- Justice!

1473
01:27:39,321 --> 01:27:43,281
In this land! - Justice!
- In this land! - Justice!

1474
01:27:43,481 --> 01:27:46,721
The time has come for.. - Justice!
- In this land! - Justice!

1475
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,161
In this land!
- Over there, sir.

1476
01:27:48,521 --> 01:27:50,401
Kashmir wants..
- Justice!

1477
01:27:50,441 --> 01:27:52,401
Justice!
- Justice!

1478
01:27:52,681 --> 01:27:54,761
Him?
I don't know him, sir.

1479
01:27:55,001 --> 01:27:57,121
He's from Kashmir Police.
Take a closer look.

1480
01:27:57,201 --> 01:28:00,481
His name is Fahim Butt.
- There's a riot outside.

1481
01:27:57,201 --> 01:28:00,481
His name is Fahim Butt.
- There's a riot outside.

1482
01:28:00,561 --> 01:28:03,481
Please ask someone else.
- But.. - What's the problem?

1483
01:28:03,561 --> 01:28:05,921
Sir, we have a visitor
inquiring about Fahim Butt.

1484
01:28:05,961 --> 01:28:08,361
What trouble are you trying
to create? Get rid of him!

1485
01:28:08,641 --> 01:28:09,521
Sorry, sir!

1486
01:28:09,881 --> 01:28:14,881
Sir, it's very important
that I find this man.

1487
01:28:14,961 --> 01:28:17,321
Look carefully, there's J&K
on his shoulder badge

1488
01:28:17,401 --> 01:28:18,921
and his name is Fahim Butt.

1489
01:28:19,001 --> 01:28:20,441
He's wearing the
Kashmir police uniform.

1490
01:28:20,681 --> 01:28:22,321
Uniforms can be bought
for 200 bucks.

1491
01:28:22,921 --> 01:28:24,401
Please don't waste our time.

1492
01:28:24,561 --> 01:28:25,521
Please leave!

1493
01:28:25,881 --> 01:28:27,361
This is Kashmir,
a curfew can happen at any time.

1494
01:28:27,441 --> 01:28:28,361
Get him out.

1495
01:28:28,521 --> 01:28:30,761
Sir, you'll get me suspended,
please leave!

1496
01:28:30,881 --> 01:28:31,841
Leave!

1497
01:28:38,481 --> 01:28:39,841
Hello, Mr. Singh.

1498
01:28:39,921 --> 01:28:43,161
Your bird has landed in Kashmir.

1499
01:28:49,641 --> 01:28:52,561
Justice!
- This land calls for.. - Justice!

1500
01:28:53,401 --> 01:28:56,121
Justice!
- Sir, just a minute.

1501
01:28:57,001 --> 01:28:59,121
Yes.
- I'm Gul Mohammad.

1502
01:28:59,921 --> 01:29:01,721
I'm a guard at the
police headquarters.

1503
01:28:59,921 --> 01:29:01,721
I'm a guard at the
police headquarters.

1504
01:29:02,561 --> 01:29:04,561
I saw you speaking
to the senior inspector.

1505
01:29:04,761 --> 01:29:07,041
You're looking for Fahim Butt?
- Yes.

1506
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:08,921
Do you know him?
- Yes.

1507
01:29:09,441 --> 01:29:11,201
Where can I find him?
- In jail.

1508
01:29:11,521 --> 01:29:12,801
In jail?

1509
01:29:12,881 --> 01:29:15,881
Everyone knows but
nobody will speak up.

1510
01:29:16,641 --> 01:29:18,121
Fahim Butt is from my hometown.

1511
01:29:18,401 --> 01:29:19,601
He's an innocent man.

1512
01:29:20,361 --> 01:29:22,121
But he's being
treated very unfairly.

1513
01:29:24,361 --> 01:29:26,961
Tell me something.
How did a cop land up in jail?

1514
01:29:27,201 --> 01:29:28,681
This is Kashmir, sir.

1515
01:29:29,081 --> 01:29:31,841
Going to jail is easier
than buying a sim card.

1516
01:29:31,921 --> 01:29:34,241
So, how can I meet him now?

1517
01:29:34,641 --> 01:29:37,281
He has a court appearance
tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock.

1518
01:30:04,401 --> 01:30:05,521
How are you, Mr. Butt?

1519
01:30:10,361 --> 01:30:13,161
What are you doing here?
- Do you know me?

1520
01:30:13,401 --> 01:30:17,401
I read about you in the newspaper.
When you got shot

1521
01:30:17,961 --> 01:30:19,281
I thought you'd back off the case

1522
01:30:20,641 --> 01:30:22,001
but you turned
out to be a brave man.

1523
01:30:23,881 --> 01:30:27,921
Mr. Butt, were you in Lucknow
when Iqbal was shot?

1524
01:30:31,761 --> 01:30:32,801
Yes, I was right there.

1525
01:30:33,081 --> 01:30:36,201
Then you must know everything
about that encounter.

1526
01:30:36,281 --> 01:30:40,241
You're very close to the truth.

1527
01:30:40,481 --> 01:30:42,681
If you testify in court

1528
01:30:42,761 --> 01:30:44,121
we can prove it.

1529
01:30:44,641 --> 01:30:46,721
But that won't help you in any way.

1530
01:30:51,961 --> 01:30:52,881
Why?

1531
01:30:53,681 --> 01:30:56,321
An innocent man was killed
and you know the truth.

1532
01:30:56,481 --> 01:30:57,721
So why won't it help me?

1533
01:30:57,801 --> 01:30:59,881
What about the one who survived?
- Who?

1534
01:31:03,801 --> 01:31:05,121
Run! Run!

1535
01:31:45,441 --> 01:31:48,601
Keep going, sir.
- Thank you.

1536
01:31:52,441 --> 01:31:55,601
Great Goddess Kali..

1537
01:31:56,161 --> 01:31:59,921
Praise Goddess Kali.

1538
01:32:02,921 --> 01:32:04,481
I have two minutes.

1539
01:32:04,681 --> 01:32:05,761
Say what you have to quickly!

1540
01:32:06,801 --> 01:32:08,841
I will only take a minute,
Mr. Paul.

1541
01:32:09,641 --> 01:32:13,161
I want you to help me
with the Iqbal Case.

1542
01:32:13,481 --> 01:32:15,561
And why would I do that?

1543
01:32:16,801 --> 01:32:20,801
Only one case has been filed out of
Singh's 25 encounters.

1544
01:32:21,201 --> 01:32:23,841
Which has shaken up your
entire police department.

1545
01:32:25,121 --> 01:32:26,401
You have 65.

1546
01:32:26,961 --> 01:32:29,841
Your license will
be suspended soon.

1547
01:32:29,921 --> 01:32:31,921
But I still have some time.

1548
01:32:32,921 --> 01:32:35,721
150 petitions are filed
every day in Lucknow Court.

1549
01:32:36,361 --> 01:32:39,001
How long do you think
it will take to file 65?

1550
01:32:39,601 --> 01:32:41,081
Are you threatening me?

1551
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:51,921
No, I'm asking for your help.

1552
01:32:59,521 --> 01:33:05,601
"Having applied the eye kohl,
entangling the hair.."

1553
01:32:59,521 --> 01:33:05,601
"Having applied the eye kohl,
entangling the hair.."

1554
01:33:05,961 --> 01:33:11,401
"I'm standing under your balcony.
I'm stuck here."

1555
01:33:11,481 --> 01:33:14,921
"Hey, darling.."

1556
01:33:14,961 --> 01:33:17,401
"Pour some perfume over."

1557
01:33:22,361 --> 01:33:25,801
"Hey, darling.."

1558
01:33:25,881 --> 01:33:27,921
Stop!
- Okay, stop!

1559
01:33:31,681 --> 01:33:33,081
Careful, Uncle!

1560
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:35,481
You had a bypass six months ago.

1561
01:33:35,601 --> 01:33:36,881
The way I see it..

1562
01:33:37,961 --> 01:33:39,561
I have only one daughter.

1563
01:33:40,041 --> 01:33:43,601
And I promised her mother-in-law
that I'll dance to this song

1564
01:33:43,681 --> 01:33:45,961
and paint the town red.

1565
01:33:46,321 --> 01:33:47,841
Do you like this song a lot?

1566
01:33:48,841 --> 01:33:52,001
I like Alia Bhatt a lot.
- Okay!

1567
01:33:52,081 --> 01:33:55,161
I've watched 'Student Of The Year'
11 times for her sake.

1568
01:33:55,521 --> 01:34:00,721
She's a perfect blend of all
our greatest actresses.

1569
01:33:55,521 --> 01:34:00,721
She's a perfect blend of all
our greatest actresses.

1570
01:34:00,841 --> 01:34:05,081
She is the best thing
to happen to Bollywood.

1571
01:34:06,121 --> 01:34:07,881
After 'Saaransh'. Right?

1572
01:34:30,041 --> 01:34:31,001
Yes, Mr. Jolly.

1573
01:34:31,881 --> 01:34:34,201
Sorry, I'm over burdened

1574
01:34:34,841 --> 01:34:36,561
with my daughter's
wedding preparations.

1575
01:34:36,641 --> 01:34:37,601
That's all right.

1576
01:34:37,761 --> 01:34:38,881
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1577
01:34:39,161 --> 01:34:40,361
Please begin, Mr. Jolly.

1578
01:34:44,201 --> 01:34:48,361
Mr. Fahim,
please tell the judge here

1579
01:34:48,441 --> 01:34:50,801
everything you know
about the Iqbal encounter.

1580
01:34:51,281 --> 01:34:53,161
Your Honour, I'm Fahim Butt.

1581
01:34:53,401 --> 01:34:57,081
I was a head constable
in Kashmir Police, Crime Branch.

1582
01:34:57,961 --> 01:34:58,841
Your Honour..

1583
01:34:59,561 --> 01:35:02,801
Yes.
- Your honour, I'm Hidayat Baig

1584
01:34:59,561 --> 01:35:02,801
Yes.
- Your honour, I'm Hidayat Baig

1585
01:35:02,841 --> 01:35:04,281
from Srinagar Police Station,
Kashmir.

1586
01:35:04,561 --> 01:35:06,881
I have arrest warrants against
Jagdishwar Mishra aka Jolly

1587
01:35:06,961 --> 01:35:08,641
and Fahim Butt.

1588
01:35:08,681 --> 01:35:11,561
The lawyer is accused of helping
Fahim Butt escape from custody.

1589
01:35:11,801 --> 01:35:15,521
What the hell
did you do in Srinagar now?

1590
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:18,241
Lawyers have really outdone
themselves these days.

1591
01:35:18,321 --> 01:35:19,281
Right, Mr. Mathur?

1592
01:35:19,881 --> 01:35:22,161
Yes, Your Honour,
this is really sad.

1593
01:35:22,241 --> 01:35:24,321
When the law is abused
by its upholders

1594
01:35:24,401 --> 01:35:26,361
then it rips apart the
very fabric of our society..

1595
01:35:26,441 --> 01:35:29,401
and turns democracy into a farce!

1596
01:35:29,481 --> 01:35:31,601
I advise you to
surrender immediately.

1597
01:35:31,681 --> 01:35:32,841
As for the case at hand

1598
01:35:32,921 --> 01:35:35,321
you can set any date.
We have no objection.

1599
01:35:35,401 --> 01:35:37,841
Your Honour, we'll surrender
to the police

1600
01:35:37,921 --> 01:35:39,961
right after the court's over.

1601
01:35:40,321 --> 01:35:43,321
But please record
Fahim Butt's statement.

1602
01:35:43,401 --> 01:35:45,481
I'm begging you..

1603
01:35:45,681 --> 01:35:48,081
I think you're expecting
too much from me.

1604
01:35:48,161 --> 01:35:49,121
Please understand!

1605
01:35:49,201 --> 01:35:50,921
No, I've tolerated you enough.
- Please.

1606
01:35:51,001 --> 01:35:55,201
Don't be a drama queen!
Don't make that innocent face.

1607
01:35:55,281 --> 01:35:57,041
Inspector, arrest him.

1608
01:35:57,081 --> 01:35:58,481
Your Honour,
it will take only five minutes.

1609
01:35:58,521 --> 01:36:00,241
Take his statement and later..

1610
01:35:58,521 --> 01:36:00,241
Take his statement and later..

1611
01:36:00,281 --> 01:36:02,041
Come on..
- Jolly.. - Listen to me..

1612
01:36:02,121 --> 01:36:03,281
Take him away..

1613
01:36:03,361 --> 01:36:04,881
Listen!
- Your Honour..

1614
01:36:04,961 --> 01:36:06,321
I asked you to take
the lawyer away

1615
01:36:06,401 --> 01:36:08,521
not him.
Bring him back to the witness box.

1616
01:36:08,881 --> 01:36:10,881
Your Honour,
I've a warrant for both of them.

1617
01:36:10,961 --> 01:36:13,081
I know. I know.

1618
01:36:13,361 --> 01:36:15,841
But Fahim Butt is
a listed witness as well.

1619
01:36:15,961 --> 01:36:17,481
So, let's record his statement.

1620
01:36:17,561 --> 01:36:20,441
You can take them both after
the statement's recorded.

1621
01:36:20,521 --> 01:36:21,521
Right? Go, go!

1622
01:36:21,761 --> 01:36:25,921
But Your Honour, can't we record
his statement on the next date?

1623
01:36:25,961 --> 01:36:29,241
You see, Mr. Mathur, I'm on
leave for two months from tomorrow.

1624
01:36:29,321 --> 01:36:30,961
It's my daughter's wedding,
as you know.

1625
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:34,041
I mean.. I'll send you the card,
you must come.

1626
01:36:34,241 --> 01:36:37,761
I wanted to finish
all pending cases before I go.

1627
01:36:37,841 --> 01:36:39,881
That's why my court's
working even after 6 p.m.

1628
01:36:39,921 --> 01:36:44,961
But, Your Honour, he's escaped
from police custody.

1629
01:36:45,281 --> 01:36:47,041
How can we record his statement?

1630
01:36:47,121 --> 01:36:49,241
He has no credibility.
- No..

1631
01:36:49,521 --> 01:36:51,801
Mr. Mathur,
it will only take a minute. - Yes.

1632
01:36:51,881 --> 01:36:54,761
Let's just record his statement
and get it out of the way.

1633
01:36:54,841 --> 01:36:57,161
Pardon me, but this not right.
What you're doing is wrong, sir.

1634
01:36:57,281 --> 01:36:58,841
No, I'm not wrong!

1635
01:36:59,121 --> 01:37:02,281
Don't teach me what's right
or wrong in my courtroom.

1636
01:36:59,121 --> 01:37:02,281
Don't teach me what's right
or wrong in my courtroom.

1637
01:37:02,361 --> 01:37:05,121
Don't do it.
- Frankly, I apologise

1638
01:37:05,241 --> 01:37:06,481
but what you're doing is wrong.

1639
01:37:06,561 --> 01:37:08,801
I've heard about
your Delhi escapades.

1640
01:37:09,521 --> 01:37:11,201
You wouldn't let anyone speak.

1641
01:37:11,241 --> 01:37:14,641
You would do as you liked
and behaved rashly!

1642
01:37:14,681 --> 01:37:18,401
Stop behaving like a dictator.
This is Lucknow and not Delhi.

1643
01:37:18,481 --> 01:37:19,601
What did you call me?

1644
01:37:20,561 --> 01:37:21,921
You're calling me a dictator!

1645
01:37:22,201 --> 01:37:23,801
So you think I'm crazy.

1646
01:37:24,161 --> 01:37:27,081
Mr. Mathur,
if I wasn't a heart patient

1647
01:37:27,321 --> 01:37:28,841
I would've shown you

1648
01:37:28,921 --> 01:37:31,481
what a dictator is.
- Just a minute, sir! - No..

1649
01:37:31,681 --> 01:37:33,841
You try being a judge.

1650
01:37:33,921 --> 01:37:36,681
I can guarantee that you'll
need a bypass too. Right?

1651
01:37:36,961 --> 01:37:38,201
Don't disrespect me. Take a seat.

1652
01:37:38,281 --> 01:37:40,001
Let's continue with the
proceedings. Yes. - No, sir!

1653
01:37:40,121 --> 01:37:43,041
I won't let this happen.
- What do you mean?

1654
01:37:43,121 --> 01:37:47,081
Sir, this is objectionable.
- It's not objectionable.

1655
01:37:47,161 --> 01:37:50,841
Let's continue. I'm right here.
I'll handle this.

1656
01:37:50,881 --> 01:37:52,401
Don't try to prove me wrong.

1657
01:37:52,441 --> 01:37:55,041
Sir, if you force this

1658
01:37:55,121 --> 01:37:57,801
I'll protest against you
right here in court.

1659
01:37:57,881 --> 01:38:00,041
In fact, I'm protesting!
Here you go.

1660
01:37:57,881 --> 01:38:00,041
In fact, I'm protesting!
Here you go.

1661
01:38:00,121 --> 01:38:03,241
You're unbelievable.

1662
01:38:03,321 --> 01:38:06,601
You're being childish! Get up.
- I won't budge from here.

1663
01:38:06,681 --> 01:38:09,561
Don't sit there, they don't
even clean the floors properly.

1664
01:38:09,641 --> 01:38:12,041
Please get up, Mr. Mathur.
Please get up.

1665
01:38:12,081 --> 01:38:13,761
I'm protesting and
I will keep at it!

1666
01:38:13,801 --> 01:38:14,921
There is media here

1667
01:38:14,961 --> 01:38:18,681
doesn't that bother you?
- Sir, let the media also see

1668
01:38:18,761 --> 01:38:21,961
how you judges treat the court

1669
01:38:22,121 --> 01:38:25,921
like your personal fiefdom.

1670
01:38:25,961 --> 01:38:28,041
I'm not moving!

1671
01:38:28,121 --> 01:38:30,321
They can write what they want.

1672
01:38:31,561 --> 01:38:32,961
So you won't get up?
- No.

1673
01:38:33,121 --> 01:38:37,241
Fine!
I will sit with you too.

1674
01:38:37,321 --> 01:38:40,361
Let the world see what these
lawyers are up to!

1675
01:38:40,561 --> 01:38:42,641
Sir?
- Stay there. Yes.

1676
01:38:43,241 --> 01:38:45,281
Ma'am, please move aside.

1677
01:38:45,641 --> 01:38:46,521
Hold the chair, please.

1678
01:38:46,681 --> 01:38:48,641
Give me a hand.

1679
01:38:50,321 --> 01:38:51,281
Thank you, Jolly.

1680
01:38:52,841 --> 01:38:53,841
Yes, Mr. Mathur.

1681
01:38:54,241 --> 01:38:56,721
Now we'll both sit in protest

1682
01:38:57,121 --> 01:38:59,321
and we'll see
who lasts the longest.

1683
01:39:01,361 --> 01:39:02,361
Okay?

1684
01:39:51,281 --> 01:39:54,641
The events that occurred
in the courtroom today

1685
01:39:54,881 --> 01:39:58,641
maybe one-of-its-kind in
the history of our judiciary.

1686
01:39:59,321 --> 01:40:01,721
There was a heated argument

1687
01:39:59,321 --> 01:40:01,721
There was a heated argument

1688
01:40:02,001 --> 01:40:05,481
between defence lawyer Pramod
Mathur and Judge Sunder Lal Tripathi

1689
01:40:05,521 --> 01:40:06,961
regarding the
statement of a witness.

1690
01:40:07,041 --> 01:40:09,401
And they protested against

1691
01:40:09,441 --> 01:40:11,801
each other in the courtroom.

1692
01:40:12,121 --> 01:40:13,601
Now we have to see

1693
01:40:13,681 --> 01:40:17,241
how long these two keep at it.

1694
01:40:18,761 --> 01:40:21,041
Sir.

1695
01:40:21,561 --> 01:40:23,721
Mr. Mathur is brilliant!

1696
01:40:26,681 --> 01:40:29,921
He's been sitting
there for five hours now.

1697
01:40:30,561 --> 01:40:32,481
And the amazing thing is

1698
01:40:32,521 --> 01:40:35,081
he didn't let Fahim Butt
record his statement.

1699
01:40:37,241 --> 01:40:39,881
Now the judge has to
re-convene on another day.

1700
01:40:40,041 --> 01:40:42,801
By then Jolly will
no longer be a lawyer.

1701
01:41:16,481 --> 01:41:19,201
Sir.

1702
01:41:36,881 --> 01:41:40,121
Should we leave for Kashmir?

1703
01:41:48,961 --> 01:41:50,041
I have to go.

1704
01:41:50,561 --> 01:41:52,841
Take care of yourself.

1705
01:41:57,001 --> 01:42:00,801
The court resumes.
Everyone take your seats.

1706
01:41:57,001 --> 01:42:00,801
The court resumes.
Everyone take your seats.

1707
01:42:01,201 --> 01:42:03,601
And please maintain
silence in court.

1708
01:42:04,761 --> 01:42:07,641
Your Honour, it is midnight, 12.

1709
01:42:07,681 --> 01:42:09,881
You can give us a later date.

1710
01:42:10,361 --> 01:42:13,601
Mr. Mathur,
what was your last date?

1711
01:42:13,681 --> 01:42:15,481
13th August.

1712
01:42:15,561 --> 01:42:17,201
So, now it's 14th August.

1713
01:42:17,241 --> 01:42:21,241
Your next date is 14th August

1714
01:42:21,961 --> 01:42:25,201
12:05 a.m.

1715
01:42:25,281 --> 01:42:29,121
Your Honour, it's midnight. The
proceeding will go on till morning.

1716
01:42:29,161 --> 01:42:32,721
Even the Supreme Court
works till 4 a.m.

1717
01:42:32,761 --> 01:42:34,721
We should follow their example.

1718
01:42:34,801 --> 01:42:36,841
Please, sir..
- No, look, Mr. Mathur

1719
01:42:36,921 --> 01:42:38,321
you wanted to stage a protest

1720
01:42:38,361 --> 01:42:40,561
and you did and I said nothing.

1721
01:42:40,641 --> 01:42:43,561
Right?
You want to walk out, you can.

1722
01:42:43,601 --> 01:42:48,281
But Fahim Butt's statement
will get recorded tonight.

1723
01:42:48,321 --> 01:42:52,241
Right? Jolly, record his statement.
- Yes.

1724
01:42:52,601 --> 01:42:54,481
Fahim.

1725
01:42:57,801 --> 01:43:02,201
Your Honour, thank you.

1726
01:42:57,801 --> 01:43:02,201
Your Honour, thank you.

1727
01:43:03,441 --> 01:43:07,641
Fahim, please tell
the judge what happened.

1728
01:43:07,761 --> 01:43:10,521
Your Honour, a few months prior
to this encounter

1729
01:43:10,841 --> 01:43:14,521
we sent an intelligence report
to Singh's team

1730
01:43:14,601 --> 01:43:17,561
which had the details of Kashmiri
terrorist Iqbal Qadri

1731
01:43:17,641 --> 01:43:18,881
hiding in Lucknow.

1732
01:43:19,321 --> 01:43:21,921
Your Honour,
just one day before this encounter

1733
01:43:21,961 --> 01:43:23,801
I was called here.

1734
01:43:23,841 --> 01:43:27,481
So I could verify whether
the arrested man

1735
01:43:27,521 --> 01:43:28,881
was Iqbal Qadri or not.

1736
01:43:28,921 --> 01:43:31,961
Your Honour, when I got here
that man was getting married.

1737
01:43:31,961 --> 01:43:35,161
I knew right away that he
wasn't the right Iqbal.

1738
01:43:35,201 --> 01:43:38,641
But, Your Honour,
Mr. Singh's team pressurised me

1739
01:43:38,681 --> 01:43:42,361
to say that Iqbal Qasim
was Iqbal Qadri.

1740
01:43:42,521 --> 01:43:45,601
I refused to comply
and returned to Srinagar.

1741
01:43:45,801 --> 01:43:48,961
I was really upset

1742
01:43:49,001 --> 01:43:51,041
when I read the news
about the encounter.

1743
01:43:51,081 --> 01:43:52,961
I told my seniors in Srinagar

1744
01:43:53,001 --> 01:43:54,521
but they advised me
to drop the matter.

1745
01:43:54,561 --> 01:43:57,001
I tried talking to them,
but they didn't listen.

1746
01:43:57,081 --> 01:43:58,041
When they didn't listen

1747
01:43:58,081 --> 01:44:01,801
I complained to the Central Agency
in Delhi about this encounter.

1748
01:43:58,081 --> 01:44:01,801
I complained to the Central Agency
in Delhi about this encounter.

1749
01:44:02,281 --> 01:44:05,401
I was pressurised again
to withdraw my complaint.

1750
01:44:05,401 --> 01:44:06,681
But I didn't agree.

1751
01:44:06,721 --> 01:44:10,561
So they arrested me one day.

1752
01:44:10,801 --> 01:44:14,641
They filed fake charges
against me and threw me in jail.

1753
01:44:14,801 --> 01:44:19,121
They even fired me
from the department.

1754
01:44:19,561 --> 01:44:21,561
Thank you.

1755
01:44:22,321 --> 01:44:23,561
Yes, Mr. Mathur

1756
01:44:23,841 --> 01:44:26,921
would you like to say something,
or are you still angry?

1757
01:44:27,281 --> 01:44:28,601
No, Your Honour.

1758
01:44:28,841 --> 01:44:33,161
I wouldn't want to lock horns with
you and destroy my career.

1759
01:44:33,241 --> 01:44:37,881
But are you still angry?
- No, I'm not angry.

1760
01:44:38,441 --> 01:44:41,521
But don't call me
a dictator next time.

1761
01:44:41,601 --> 01:44:42,841
Right, Mr. Mathur.

1762
01:44:42,881 --> 01:44:45,521
I've grown old serving this court

1763
01:44:45,561 --> 01:44:49,681
and I think I deserve some respect.
- I apologise.

1764
01:44:49,721 --> 01:44:52,161
Fine, continue.

1765
01:44:54,401 --> 01:44:56,001
Fahim Butt?

1766
01:44:56,081 --> 01:44:59,761
Will you inform the honourable
judge what the case is about?

1767
01:44:59,841 --> 01:45:03,321
What truth are we trying to
arrive at here in court?

1768
01:44:59,841 --> 01:45:03,321
What truth are we trying to
arrive at here in court?

1769
01:45:03,401 --> 01:45:08,241
How did constable Bhadoria
and Iqbal die.

1770
01:45:08,281 --> 01:45:13,161
In this long yarn that you've spun

1771
01:45:13,201 --> 01:45:14,841
does the truth about

1772
01:45:14,881 --> 01:45:16,201
who murdered them get revealed?

1773
01:45:16,241 --> 01:45:19,121
Since you weren't there at the
scene of the crime.

1774
01:45:19,161 --> 01:45:20,241
But then..

1775
01:45:20,561 --> 01:45:22,401
What's revealed is..
- No more buts.

1776
01:45:22,441 --> 01:45:25,281
If you want to narrate more fiction,
the judge is free.

1777
01:45:25,361 --> 01:45:26,761
He loves filmy stories.

1778
01:45:26,801 --> 01:45:28,641
I'm absolutely not interested.

1779
01:45:28,681 --> 01:45:31,561
Just give me a straight answer.

1780
01:45:31,601 --> 01:45:34,081
Yes or no?
- No.

1781
01:45:34,121 --> 01:45:36,401
Very good, well done.

1782
01:45:40,081 --> 01:45:43,361
Fahim Butt, in August 2010

1783
01:45:43,401 --> 01:45:46,601
Kashmir Police suspended
you for six months

1784
01:45:46,641 --> 01:45:49,561
for the Kupwara incident.
Why?

1785
01:45:49,601 --> 01:45:53,281
Your Honour, how is this
question related to our case?

1786
01:45:53,321 --> 01:45:57,721
If there's no relation,
I'll stop practicing law.

1787
01:45:57,841 --> 01:45:59,001
I told you

1788
01:45:59,081 --> 01:46:01,161
I won't beat around the bush.
- I know!

1789
01:45:59,081 --> 01:46:01,161
I won't beat around the bush.
- I know!

1790
01:46:01,241 --> 01:46:03,801
You'll be direct, I know.
- And straight!

1791
01:46:03,841 --> 01:46:07,241
May I?
- Yes, or you'll protest again.

1792
01:46:07,881 --> 01:46:10,281
Yes, so why were you suspended?

1793
01:46:10,601 --> 01:46:12,961
I was accused of a custodial death.

1794
01:46:13,001 --> 01:46:14,721
You mean you killed someone?

1795
01:46:14,761 --> 01:46:17,241
No, I arrested him on suspicion.

1796
01:46:17,321 --> 01:46:19,841
We were taking him to the
police station, for questioning.

1797
01:46:19,881 --> 01:46:22,681
He was scared. He jumped
out of the police van

1798
01:46:22,761 --> 01:46:24,361
and a truck crushed him to death.

1799
01:46:24,401 --> 01:46:25,721
So tell me, Fahim Butt

1800
01:46:25,761 --> 01:46:30,521
if fear can make a man jump
out of a speeding van

1801
01:46:30,561 --> 01:46:32,201
isn't it possible that

1802
01:46:32,281 --> 01:46:33,721
the same fear can provoke

1803
01:46:33,761 --> 01:46:37,441
a criminal to snatch a gun

1804
01:46:37,481 --> 01:46:38,561
and try to escape?

1805
01:46:38,601 --> 01:46:40,401
Your Honour,
he's leading the witness.

1806
01:46:40,441 --> 01:46:42,121
Objection overruled.

1807
01:46:42,161 --> 01:46:44,041
Please sit down.

1808
01:46:45,201 --> 01:46:47,481
Yes, it's possible.
- Then say it out loud, buddy.

1809
01:46:47,561 --> 01:46:50,361
We all know it's happened to you.

1810
01:46:50,441 --> 01:46:53,401
So you would know that this
could happen to anyone. Right?

1811
01:46:53,561 --> 01:46:55,761
Yes.
- Very good.

1812
01:46:56,201 --> 01:46:58,801
Just one last question.

1813
01:46:58,841 --> 01:47:01,081
You just said

1814
01:46:58,841 --> 01:47:01,081
You just said

1815
01:47:01,121 --> 01:47:03,961
you were suspended for
a few months.

1816
01:47:03,961 --> 01:47:06,721
What were the charges against you?

1817
01:47:07,201 --> 01:47:11,601
I was accused of sharing confidential
information with the enemy.

1818
01:47:12,361 --> 01:47:13,881
But that's a lie, Your Honour.

1819
01:47:14,321 --> 01:47:15,881
Your Honour, I was put behind bars

1820
01:47:15,921 --> 01:47:18,201
because I complained
about this matter to the CBI.

1821
01:47:18,241 --> 01:47:19,161
You're saying that.

1822
01:47:19,241 --> 01:47:23,281
Your statement won't
prove your innocence.

1823
01:47:23,361 --> 01:47:27,601
Your Honour,
my learned friend forgets

1824
01:47:27,641 --> 01:47:29,801
that the accused is innocent,
until proven guilty.

1825
01:47:30,081 --> 01:47:33,121
That is the point.

1826
01:47:33,481 --> 01:47:35,561
That's the bloody point!

1827
01:47:36,081 --> 01:47:38,721
And, Your Honour,
on the basis of this logic

1828
01:47:38,761 --> 01:47:43,721
Inspector Suryaveer Singh
and his team are innocent.

1829
01:47:45,641 --> 01:47:50,441
But let's read this
newspaper for a minute.

1830
01:47:50,961 --> 01:47:52,961
Switch to any TV channel.

1831
01:47:53,041 --> 01:47:56,561
The media, society and the country

1832
01:47:56,601 --> 01:48:00,521
have already declared

1833
01:47:56,601 --> 01:48:00,521
have already declared

1834
01:48:00,561 --> 01:48:03,201
Suryaveer Singh guilty.

1835
01:48:03,281 --> 01:48:07,801
His reputation,
his career, his future is finished!

1836
01:48:08,641 --> 01:48:11,321
And it's the irony of your court

1837
01:48:11,361 --> 01:48:14,641
that a man charged with treason

1838
01:48:14,681 --> 01:48:17,961
is accusing a man

1839
01:48:18,001 --> 01:48:21,161
who has sworn to
protect his Motherland.

1840
01:48:29,241 --> 01:48:31,081
Your Honour, many years ago

1841
01:48:31,161 --> 01:48:34,881
there was a bomb blast
outside Allahabad High Court

1842
01:48:34,921 --> 01:48:37,561
where nine innocent
lives were lost.

1843
01:48:37,601 --> 01:48:40,881
Amongst the deceased were
my elder brother, sister-in-law

1844
01:48:40,921 --> 01:48:43,681
and my seven year old nephew.

1845
01:48:43,721 --> 01:48:46,601
My beloved father,
Jugal Kishore Mathur

1846
01:48:46,641 --> 01:48:49,281
was injured during the
same terrorist attack.

1847
01:48:49,361 --> 01:48:51,521
Yet he's here.

1848
01:48:51,881 --> 01:48:55,241
In the middle of the night,
he's come here to see

1849
01:48:55,801 --> 01:48:59,681
which side you're on.

1850
01:48:59,841 --> 01:49:01,801
And, Your Honour,
my question is that

1851
01:48:59,841 --> 01:49:01,801
And, Your Honour,
my question is that

1852
01:49:01,841 --> 01:49:06,681
is this court so weak that it's
unable to decide whether the country

1853
01:49:07,001 --> 01:49:10,481
needs brave officers
like Suryaveer Singh

1854
01:49:10,641 --> 01:49:13,481
or murderers like Iqbal Qadri?

1855
01:49:13,761 --> 01:49:18,161
And, Your Honour, I would like
to close by saying

1856
01:49:18,721 --> 01:49:21,401
that we may choose
to be ignorant

1857
01:49:21,441 --> 01:49:24,361
live in our own bubble

1858
01:49:24,441 --> 01:49:29,281
but the truth is, Your Honour,
that we're in a state of war.

1859
01:49:30,481 --> 01:49:33,321
And a learned man once rightly said

1860
01:49:33,521 --> 01:49:38,001
everything is fair in love and war!

1861
01:49:38,041 --> 01:49:41,561
And now, justice is in your hands.

1862
01:49:42,121 --> 01:49:44,921
Thank you.

1863
01:49:54,601 --> 01:49:56,961
So, Mr. Jolly, your turn.

1864
01:49:57,001 --> 01:50:00,281
I would like to question
Mr. Singh first.

1865
01:49:57,001 --> 01:50:00,281
I would like to question
Mr. Singh first.

1866
01:50:00,321 --> 01:50:03,121
Mr. Singh,
please step into the witness box.

1867
01:50:10,241 --> 01:50:12,921
Mr. Singh, will you
please tell the court

1868
01:50:12,961 --> 01:50:15,961
who will win the
next Cricket World Cup?

1869
01:50:16,041 --> 01:50:19,161
What kind of a question is that?

1870
01:50:19,281 --> 01:50:21,641
Fine, I'll ask something else.

1871
01:50:21,681 --> 01:50:24,241
Mr. Singh,
can you please tell the court

1872
01:50:24,281 --> 01:50:28,761
if Aam Aadmi Party will win
in the next elections?

1873
01:50:29,681 --> 01:50:31,201
Are you crazy?

1874
01:50:31,241 --> 01:50:32,881
Have you lost your mind?

1875
01:50:33,361 --> 01:50:34,721
Do you want to be shot again?

1876
01:50:34,761 --> 01:50:37,801
I'm a peace-loving man, Mr. Singh

1877
01:50:37,841 --> 01:50:39,961
but when in law college

1878
01:50:40,041 --> 01:50:43,521
a very tall guy provoked me.

1879
01:50:43,561 --> 01:50:46,761
I punched him right here

1880
01:50:47,721 --> 01:50:49,601
and he was out cold for 22 days!

1881
01:50:49,641 --> 01:50:51,161
If you don't believe me,
you can ask Mathur.

1882
01:50:51,201 --> 01:50:53,721
Take it easy, Jolly.

1883
01:50:53,801 --> 01:50:55,121
Calm down. This is a court!

1884
01:50:55,201 --> 01:50:57,081
Ask questions but don't
create a scene here.

1885
01:50:57,121 --> 01:50:59,961
He's calling me crazy
and being rude.

1886
01:51:00,601 --> 01:51:04,601
Mr. Singh, why are you being rude?
Let it go.

1887
01:51:04,681 --> 01:51:06,521
Calm down.
Continue please.

1888
01:51:06,561 --> 01:51:08,481
Let's try that again, sir.

1889
01:51:08,521 --> 01:51:12,681
Can you tell us when
Salman Khan will get married?

1890
01:51:14,481 --> 01:51:16,321
What are you asking him?

1891
01:51:16,361 --> 01:51:18,281
He's a police officer
not an astrologer.

1892
01:51:18,321 --> 01:51:19,961
If he's not an astrologer

1893
01:51:20,041 --> 01:51:21,721
how did he know

1894
01:51:21,801 --> 01:51:26,161
that Iqbal would want to
pee at precisely 6:45 a.m.?

1895
01:51:26,561 --> 01:51:28,361
How did he know that
when he would want to pee

1896
01:51:28,401 --> 01:51:30,681
the van would be crossing
the Gomti river bridge.

1897
01:51:30,721 --> 01:51:34,561
How did he know that Iqbal would
snatch constable Bhadoria's revolver

1898
01:51:34,601 --> 01:51:36,401
and try to run?

1899
01:51:36,441 --> 01:51:37,681
He wasn't at the wedding.

1900
01:51:37,721 --> 01:51:39,561
Then how did you get to the bridge?

1901
01:51:40,521 --> 01:51:42,161
Here, I'm right here.

1902
01:51:42,201 --> 01:51:44,681
How did you get to the bridge?

1903
01:51:44,761 --> 01:51:47,441
Coincidence.
- Hear that? Coincidence.

1904
01:51:47,521 --> 01:51:50,401
Thankfully I was at the
right place at the right time.

1905
01:51:51,561 --> 01:51:55,601
There are a lot of coincidences
in your story, Mr. Singh.

1906
01:51:58,561 --> 01:52:03,401
Your Honour, I have a list of
all his 25 encounters.

1907
01:51:58,561 --> 01:52:03,401
Your Honour, I have a list of
all his 25 encounters.

1908
01:52:03,441 --> 01:52:06,321
Such coincidences have
often occurred in his life.

1909
01:52:06,401 --> 01:52:08,441
Just when the criminal
is about to shoot

1910
01:52:08,481 --> 01:52:10,401
he arrives out of
nowhere like a superhero!

1911
01:52:10,441 --> 01:52:13,321
And not just in Lucknow,
but in other cities as well.

1912
01:52:13,361 --> 01:52:14,801
Your Honour

1913
01:52:16,961 --> 01:52:18,841
19 out of the 25 families
of the encounter victims

1914
01:52:18,881 --> 01:52:23,081
have lodged complaints against him.

1915
01:52:23,121 --> 01:52:27,081
But not a single unbiased
investigation was ever carried out.

1916
01:52:27,121 --> 01:52:29,641
According to a report from
the Anti-Corruption bureau

1917
01:52:29,681 --> 01:52:32,761
he's believed to
own assets worth 280 million.

1918
01:52:32,841 --> 01:52:35,081
But they couldn't complete
their investigation either.

1919
01:52:35,161 --> 01:52:36,561
It was shut down.

1920
01:52:36,601 --> 01:52:40,281
And Mathur brought his
old father out here on a wheelchair

1921
01:52:40,601 --> 01:52:44,481
to save a man like him.

1922
01:52:44,521 --> 01:52:47,881
I pity him and others like him.

1923
01:52:49,961 --> 01:52:52,561
I bow to you, thank you very much.

1924
01:52:52,601 --> 01:52:54,601
I bow to you and your advocacy.

1925
01:52:54,641 --> 01:52:57,241
Your Honour, he is besmirching

1926
01:52:57,281 --> 01:52:58,521
an honest and brave
officer's character.

1927
01:52:58,601 --> 01:52:59,881
While you're silently watching.

1928
01:53:03,401 --> 01:53:04,841
Brave?

1929
01:53:04,881 --> 01:53:06,601
That's nonsense!

1930
01:53:06,681 --> 01:53:09,961
He shoots a handcuffed man
in the back

1931
01:53:10,081 --> 01:53:12,281
and you call him brave!

1932
01:53:12,321 --> 01:53:16,361
A man who earns a salary
of Rs. 35,000 owns millions

1933
01:53:16,401 --> 01:53:17,481
and you call him honest.

1934
01:53:17,521 --> 01:53:19,641
He's like termite.

1935
01:53:19,681 --> 01:53:23,041
He'll weaken the system,
from the inside.

1936
01:53:23,081 --> 01:53:24,521
Show some respect!

1937
01:53:24,601 --> 01:53:28,001
Mr. Mathur show some
respect for the country!

1938
01:53:42,441 --> 01:53:46,521
I can understand
Jugal Kishore Mathur's pain.

1939
01:53:46,561 --> 01:53:49,041
A woman killed herself
because of me

1940
01:53:49,441 --> 01:53:52,481
and I couldn't sleep for months.

1941
01:53:54,041 --> 01:53:58,161
But Mr. Mathur lost his son,
daughter-in-law and grandson.

1942
01:53:59,921 --> 01:54:03,241
Only one man other than

1943
01:53:59,921 --> 01:54:03,241
Only one man other than

1944
01:54:03,281 --> 01:54:06,721
him can understand his pain.

1945
01:54:08,801 --> 01:54:11,241
Mr. Zahur Siddiqui.

1946
01:54:13,441 --> 01:54:14,961
Even he lost his daughter,
son-in-law

1947
01:54:15,001 --> 01:54:17,481
and unborn grandchild.

1948
01:54:18,481 --> 01:54:22,721
Their pain is similar, Your Honour.

1949
01:54:22,761 --> 01:54:26,481
Whether I call him
Jugal Kishore Siddiqui or call him

1950
01:54:26,521 --> 01:54:30,081
Zahur Kishore Mathur it
won't make a difference.

1951
01:54:30,481 --> 01:54:31,921
Your Honour

1952
01:54:31,961 --> 01:54:35,961
two lives were lost on the
Gomti river bridge that day.

1953
01:54:36,401 --> 01:54:37,401
One

1954
01:54:37,441 --> 01:54:41,961
the newly married Iqbal Qasim

1955
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:44,361
and the other, was constable
Baldev Singh Bhadoria

1956
01:54:44,441 --> 01:54:47,401
who was supposed
to retire in 20 days.

1957
01:54:48,281 --> 01:54:52,321
And, Your Honour,
this is constable Bhadoria's wife

1958
01:54:53,641 --> 01:54:56,121
who has lost her husband

1959
01:54:56,361 --> 01:54:59,601
and is doing the rounds
of the court

1960
01:54:59,681 --> 01:55:02,481
to get bail for her son.

1961
01:54:59,681 --> 01:55:02,481
to get bail for her son.

1962
01:55:03,961 --> 01:55:06,281
What will you tell her, Mr. Mathur?

1963
01:55:06,521 --> 01:55:10,041
'Smile, you're in Lucknow.'

1964
01:55:10,641 --> 01:55:13,081
The truth is bitter, huh?

1965
01:55:13,281 --> 01:55:15,241
Mr. Mathur.

1966
01:55:15,321 --> 01:55:17,961
Mr. Mathur

1967
01:55:20,481 --> 01:55:23,401
Coincidences don't happen
only with you, Singh.

1968
01:55:23,441 --> 01:55:25,601
I've the blessing of God.

1969
01:55:25,681 --> 01:55:29,201
Such a coincidence
has happened to me.

1970
01:55:29,281 --> 01:55:32,401
I promise,
this is going to be interesting.

1971
01:55:33,401 --> 01:55:35,561
Bring him in.

1972
01:55:35,601 --> 01:55:37,841
Hurry up!

1973
01:55:59,561 --> 01:56:03,121
Sir, can I ask what's
going on in this court?

1974
01:55:59,561 --> 01:56:03,121
Sir, can I ask what's
going on in this court?

1975
01:56:03,161 --> 01:56:06,841
And will you please tell me
why you're letting this happen?

1976
01:56:06,881 --> 01:56:08,281
Who is this man?

1977
01:56:08,321 --> 01:56:10,481
How is he related to this case, sir?

1978
01:56:10,521 --> 01:56:12,881
We were given no advance
notice or prior warning.

1979
01:56:12,961 --> 01:56:15,281
What is the relevance?
And you're allowing this?

1980
01:56:15,641 --> 01:56:18,401
Your Honour,
if I had given prior notice

1981
01:56:18,441 --> 01:56:20,441
this witness would have been

1982
01:56:20,481 --> 01:56:22,441
buried in some deep,
dark corner of a morgue.

1983
01:56:22,481 --> 01:56:25,761
I didn't bring this man here,
in fact, the police caught him.

1984
01:56:25,881 --> 01:56:30,561
And, Your Honour, this witness is
directly connected to this case.

1985
01:56:31,001 --> 01:56:33,961
Inspector, did you arrest him?

1986
01:56:34,041 --> 01:56:36,561
Sir, he is absolutely right.

1987
01:56:36,601 --> 01:56:39,241
This man is directly connected
to this case.

1988
01:56:39,281 --> 01:56:41,881
If there's no connection

1989
01:56:42,481 --> 01:56:44,961
I'll have your job.

1990
01:56:44,961 --> 01:56:47,161
But, Your Honour, I'm right.

1991
01:56:49,761 --> 01:56:52,721
Fine, I'll allow the witness.
- No, sir, I object, sir!

1992
01:56:52,761 --> 01:56:55,241
I object..
- Mr. Mathur, listen to me.

1993
01:56:55,281 --> 01:56:57,201
It's almost 3 a.m.

1994
01:56:57,241 --> 01:56:59,521
We won't find public transport
at this hour.

1995
01:56:59,561 --> 01:57:01,401
We have to be here
till 6 a.m. anyway.

1996
01:56:59,561 --> 01:57:01,401
We have to be here
till 6 a.m. anyway.

1997
01:57:01,561 --> 01:57:03,561
Let's hear out this witness.

1998
01:57:03,641 --> 01:57:05,801
I mean, it might be useful.

1999
01:57:05,841 --> 01:57:08,081
Please come to the witness box.

2000
01:57:16,481 --> 01:57:18,881
Hello, how are you?

2001
01:57:19,601 --> 01:57:23,841
You're all dressed up
in your holy attire.

2002
01:57:23,881 --> 01:57:25,881
Fahim Butt, please stand up.

2003
01:57:25,921 --> 01:57:29,161
Please tell the court
this man's name.

2004
01:57:29,441 --> 01:57:32,561
Mohammad Iqbal Qadri.
- Huh! What?

2005
01:57:32,601 --> 01:57:35,441
Mohammad Iqbal?
- Qadri.

2006
01:57:35,481 --> 01:57:37,601
Mohammad Iqbal Qadri!

2007
01:57:37,641 --> 01:57:40,961
Where did you arrest him?
- In Mathura.

2008
01:57:40,961 --> 01:57:43,561
He has been hiding there since
one year disguised as a saint.

2009
01:57:43,601 --> 01:57:48,321
That's amazing.
- Sir, the inspector is lying.

2010
01:57:48,361 --> 01:57:50,161
My name isn't Iqbal Qadri.

2011
01:57:50,521 --> 01:57:53,201
I'm Ramkrishan Saraswat.

2012
01:57:53,281 --> 01:57:56,001
I'm a Brahmin and a monk.

2013
01:57:56,081 --> 01:57:59,641
I'm originally from Jammu which
is why I have a Kashmiri accent.

2014
01:57:59,721 --> 01:58:01,921
But I'm not who they say I am.

2015
01:57:59,721 --> 01:58:01,921
But I'm not who they say I am.

2016
01:58:02,081 --> 01:58:05,521
This is my Aadhar Card
and voter ID.

2017
01:58:05,561 --> 01:58:07,401
Om Prakash, please get those to me.

2018
01:58:07,481 --> 01:58:08,961
Go on, hurry up.

2019
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:11,681
Your Honour, this man is lying.

2020
01:58:11,761 --> 01:58:14,441
He confessed that he's Iqbal Qadri

2021
01:58:14,481 --> 01:58:17,081
in his statement to the police.

2022
01:58:17,121 --> 01:58:20,161
You have two stars on that uniform

2023
01:58:20,201 --> 01:58:23,281
and yet you don't know
that any statement given

2024
01:58:23,321 --> 01:58:24,841
to the police is
not admissible in court!

2025
01:58:24,881 --> 01:58:27,801
This man is a trained militant.

2026
01:58:27,841 --> 01:58:31,761
You're aware that making a fake
identity card is not difficult.

2027
01:58:31,801 --> 01:58:34,641
And Fahim Butt has identified him
as well. - Yes.

2028
01:58:34,681 --> 01:58:37,961
Sir, he's hiding his identity!

2029
01:58:38,001 --> 01:58:39,881
Your Honour,
he's not hiding his identity

2030
01:58:39,921 --> 01:58:41,241
he's stating it.

2031
01:58:41,281 --> 01:58:42,761
How will he tell us his identity?

2032
01:58:42,801 --> 01:58:43,961
How else will he prove it?

2033
01:58:44,041 --> 01:58:45,361
You're Sunder Lal Tripathi.

2034
01:58:45,401 --> 01:58:46,681
I'm Pramod Mathur.

2035
01:58:46,721 --> 01:58:48,961
He's Jolly from Kanpur.
How will we know that?

2036
01:58:49,041 --> 01:58:51,921
Only through identity cards.

2037
01:58:51,961 --> 01:58:53,281
The evidence is right before you,
sir.

2038
01:58:53,361 --> 01:58:54,521
There's no doubt.

2039
01:58:54,561 --> 01:58:57,161
And let me point out to you,
sir, that my

2040
01:58:57,201 --> 01:58:59,441
learned friend here has
already presented a fake witness.

2041
01:58:59,881 --> 01:59:02,081
The Bar association has
cancelled his license.

2042
01:58:59,881 --> 01:59:02,081
The Bar association has
cancelled his license.

2043
01:59:02,121 --> 01:59:04,401
In a few hours he won't
even be a lawyer.

2044
01:59:04,441 --> 01:59:06,121
Please don't take him seriously.

2045
01:59:06,201 --> 01:59:08,401
I have a few hours, don't I?
- You do.

2046
01:59:08,481 --> 01:59:10,601
So I can fight the case till then. I
can fight the case till then, right?

2047
01:59:10,641 --> 01:59:14,841
Jolly, please no
fighting in this courtroom.

2048
01:59:14,881 --> 01:59:16,881
Mathur is right.

2049
01:59:16,921 --> 01:59:19,201
I think the police
have made a mistake.

2050
01:59:19,881 --> 01:59:22,041
Sorry, mister, you may leave.

2051
01:59:22,081 --> 01:59:23,721
Just a minute!
- Jolly!

2052
01:59:23,761 --> 01:59:25,441
Jolly..
- Stay there!

2053
01:59:25,481 --> 01:59:29,881
Just a minute! Sir, I beg of
you to let me question him.

2054
01:59:29,921 --> 01:59:32,321
It wasn't easy for me
to get him here.

2055
01:59:32,361 --> 01:59:35,161
Give me one chance!
- No..

2056
01:59:35,321 --> 01:59:36,561
No.
- What did you just say? Tell me.

2057
01:59:36,641 --> 01:59:38,521
There's no public transport.

2058
01:59:38,561 --> 01:59:41,041
Give me one chance.
- First stop shouting!

2059
01:59:41,081 --> 01:59:42,801
Be quiet for a second!
- Sorry!

2060
01:59:42,841 --> 01:59:44,841
Be quiet for a second.
- Okay.

2061
01:59:57,121 --> 01:59:59,681
Fine, I'll allow the witness.
- Sir!

2062
01:59:59,721 --> 02:00:02,081
What is this?
- Mr. Mathur

2063
01:59:59,721 --> 02:00:02,081
What is this?
- Mr. Mathur

2064
02:00:02,121 --> 02:00:04,641
I think the court has
the right to decide, okay.

2065
02:00:04,961 --> 02:00:06,841
And court has decided, please.

2066
02:00:07,361 --> 02:00:09,361
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

2067
02:00:14,641 --> 02:00:16,961
So you're a Brahmin. A monk.

2068
02:00:19,041 --> 02:00:22,961
You must know a lot about religion.
- Of course, I do.

2069
02:00:23,041 --> 02:00:25,561
Even I'm a 'Kanya-Gupch Brahmin'.

2070
02:00:28,921 --> 02:00:30,161
I have even been anointed.

2071
02:00:30,241 --> 02:00:33,641
So how about a religious discourse
between two Brahmins?

2072
02:00:33,961 --> 02:00:36,081
Please ask what you like.

2073
02:00:36,761 --> 02:00:39,601
Chant the Gayatri Mantra.

2074
02:00:48,161 --> 02:00:50,121
Wonderful,
now tell me your full name.

2075
02:00:50,161 --> 02:00:52,481
Ramkrishan Premkrishan Saraswat.

2076
02:00:52,521 --> 02:00:53,761
Religion?
- Hindu.

2077
02:00:54,321 --> 02:00:55,921
How many Vedas are there
in the Hindu religion?

2078
02:00:56,441 --> 02:00:58,041
Four.

2079
02:00:58,081 --> 02:01:02,281
Tell me their names? - Rigved,
Samaved, Yajurved, Atharvaved.

2080
02:00:58,081 --> 02:01:02,281
Tell me their names? - Rigved,
Samaved, Yajurved, Atharvaved.

2081
02:01:02,441 --> 02:01:04,241
Name the four periods?

2082
02:01:04,281 --> 02:01:07,681
Satyug, Dwapar, Treta, Kalyug.

2083
02:01:07,721 --> 02:01:09,241
How many castes?
- Four.

2084
02:01:09,281 --> 02:01:12,481
Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra.

2085
02:01:12,521 --> 02:01:14,721
What caste are you?
- Brahmin.

2086
02:01:14,801 --> 02:01:17,041
What type of Brahmin?

2087
02:01:17,081 --> 02:01:18,681
Which Gor?

Family deity?

Level? - Vaam. - Sub-Level?
- Allah, there's more?

2095
02:01:29,321 --> 02:01:30,521
What did you say?

2096
02:01:30,561 --> 02:01:32,881
Allah?

2097
02:01:33,561 --> 02:01:35,921
What did you say?
- I don't know the sub-level.

2098
02:01:35,961 --> 02:01:37,081
I don't know.

2099
02:01:37,121 --> 02:01:38,521
What did you say before that?

2100
02:01:38,681 --> 02:01:40,321
What did you say before that,
Iqbal Qadri?

2101
02:01:40,361 --> 02:01:42,721
Shame on you,
Iqbal Qadri, shame on you!

2102
02:01:43,201 --> 02:01:46,081
You've even taken Allah's name.
Speak the truth!

2103
02:01:46,121 --> 02:01:48,041
You can't escape now.

2104
02:01:48,081 --> 02:01:49,721
How long will you
live this deceitful life?

2105
02:01:49,761 --> 02:01:52,281
Shame on you!
At least speak the truth now!

2106
02:01:52,361 --> 02:01:54,641
Don't forget you have to face
Allah on your day of reckoning!

2107
02:01:54,681 --> 02:01:56,761
Allah is witness

2108
02:01:56,801 --> 02:01:58,441
to everything.

2109
02:01:58,481 --> 02:02:00,761
He will ultimately decide
who is right and who is wrong.

2110
02:01:58,481 --> 02:02:00,761
He will ultimately decide
who is right and who is wrong.

2111
02:02:01,041 --> 02:02:03,081
I will have no regrets

2112
02:02:03,481 --> 02:02:05,961
if I don't get justice today.

2113
02:02:06,041 --> 02:02:09,041
Iqbal Qadri, I could've asked
for a DNA test

2114
02:02:09,081 --> 02:02:11,241
to prove who you really are.

2115
02:02:11,361 --> 02:02:13,601
But I wanted to hear it from you.

2116
02:02:13,641 --> 02:02:17,721
Tell the court your real name!

2117
02:02:23,441 --> 02:02:27,841
Your Honour, my name
is Mohammad Iqbal Qadri.

2118
02:02:29,481 --> 02:02:31,601
Mr. Singh arrested me.

2119
02:02:31,641 --> 02:02:36,001
I was in his custody but
he didn't present me in court.

2120
02:02:37,161 --> 02:02:39,801
I knew he was going to kill me.

2121
02:02:39,841 --> 02:02:41,041
One day I got the opportunity
to tell him

2122
02:02:41,121 --> 02:02:44,601
that he'd get paid handsomely
if he let me go.

2123
02:02:45,441 --> 02:02:47,401
And he agreed.

2124
02:02:47,841 --> 02:02:51,481
Where are you taking him?
- Mr. Singh has set him free.

2125
02:02:52,801 --> 02:02:54,001
He's leaving.

2126
02:02:54,361 --> 02:02:56,121
Come on.

2127
02:02:58,201 --> 02:03:00,401
How much did you pay Singh?

2128
02:02:58,201 --> 02:03:00,401
How much did you pay Singh?

2129
02:03:00,721 --> 02:03:02,121
5 million.

2130
02:03:02,401 --> 02:03:06,721
2.5 million advance and the
rest after the encounter.

2131
02:03:06,761 --> 02:03:09,081
I object, Your Honour!

2132
02:03:31,921 --> 02:03:34,441
I've nothing else to say,
Your Honour.

2133
02:03:34,961 --> 02:03:39,681
But I would like to answer
Mr. Mathur's question

2134
02:03:39,721 --> 02:03:43,601
whether we need
Suryaveer Singh or Iqbal Qadri.

2135
02:03:45,561 --> 02:03:48,881
Your Honour, we don't want either.

2136
02:03:49,641 --> 02:03:54,121
We don't want Qadris like him

2137
02:03:54,161 --> 02:03:56,961
who think killing
innocent people is jihad.

2138
02:03:57,041 --> 02:04:00,281
But we also don't
want Suryaveer Singh

2139
02:03:57,041 --> 02:04:00,281
But we also don't
want Suryaveer Singh

2140
02:04:00,401 --> 02:04:05,201
who killed an innocent man
and let a terrorist go free.

2141
02:04:05,841 --> 02:04:10,121
I salute brave and
courageous policemen.

2142
02:04:10,161 --> 02:04:12,401
I bow before them.

2143
02:04:12,441 --> 02:04:16,201
But I'll call someone who's got

2144
02:04:16,561 --> 02:04:19,041
an innocent's blood on his hands

2145
02:04:19,361 --> 02:04:21,241
a murderer.

2146
02:04:21,841 --> 02:04:24,801
And you should be wary
of such demons, Mr. Mathur.

2147
02:04:24,841 --> 02:04:27,201
If someone pays them

2148
02:04:27,241 --> 02:04:30,761
maybe the next coincidence
could be you.

2149
02:04:36,081 --> 02:04:38,241
I would like to close by saying

2150
02:04:38,681 --> 02:04:42,121
the world's biggest idiot said

2151
02:04:42,321 --> 02:04:45,601
all's fair in love and war!

2152
02:04:45,961 --> 02:04:47,721
If that's true

2153
02:04:47,801 --> 02:04:51,641
those who behead our soldiers
at the border are also right

2154
02:04:51,681 --> 02:04:55,161
and so are the jilted lovers
who throw acid on young girls.

2155
02:04:55,241 --> 02:04:58,681
If that's true,
Iqbal Qadri is also right

2156
02:04:58,721 --> 02:05:01,001
and so is Suryaveer Singh.

2157
02:04:58,721 --> 02:05:01,001
and so is Suryaveer Singh.

2158
02:05:01,081 --> 02:05:03,121
Now you decide, Your Honour

2159
02:05:03,641 --> 02:05:08,801
whether they are right or wrong.

2160
02:05:10,681 --> 02:05:13,521
That's all, Your Honour.

2161
02:05:34,121 --> 02:05:36,521
Thank you.

2162
02:05:53,801 --> 02:05:58,441
Once every few years we
get a case like this

2163
02:05:59,641 --> 02:06:03,321
when I don't regret
sitting on this chair.

2164
02:05:59,641 --> 02:06:03,321
when I don't regret
sitting on this chair.

2165
02:06:03,361 --> 02:06:05,201
I come to the court every day.

2166
02:06:06,001 --> 02:06:07,121
I sit looking at my watch.

2167
02:06:07,161 --> 02:06:11,841
Waiting for the clock
to strike six so I can go home.

2168
02:06:12,961 --> 02:06:14,761
What to do?

2169
02:06:14,801 --> 02:06:16,801
It's the sad condition
of the judicial system.

2170
02:06:16,841 --> 02:06:18,401
Take a look around at

2171
02:06:18,441 --> 02:06:22,121
these dark, stinking rooms
that are our courtrooms.

2172
02:06:22,281 --> 02:06:24,841
Even judges like us
don't want to be here

2173
02:06:24,921 --> 02:06:26,321
imagine the plight
of the common people.

2174
02:06:26,361 --> 02:06:27,921
Am I right, Mr. Mathur?

2175
02:06:29,281 --> 02:06:30,881
30 million!

2176
02:06:30,921 --> 02:06:34,161
More than 30 million cases
are pending in this country.

2177
02:06:34,881 --> 02:06:37,601
And there are only 21,000 judges.

2178
02:06:37,881 --> 02:06:42,241
That's one judge for
a million people.

2179
02:06:43,201 --> 02:06:46,201
Dates keep piling up

2180
02:06:46,241 --> 02:06:49,441
and people return disappointed.

2181
02:06:50,321 --> 02:06:52,201
But even then

2182
02:06:52,481 --> 02:06:56,561
when two people fight in India

2183
02:06:57,441 --> 02:07:00,961
what's the first thing
they say to each other?

2184
02:06:57,441 --> 02:07:00,961
what's the first thing
they say to each other?

2185
02:07:01,041 --> 02:07:03,641
'I will see you in court.'

2186
02:07:04,561 --> 02:07:06,601
Why do people do that?

2187
02:07:06,641 --> 02:07:07,841
Tell me?

2188
02:07:07,881 --> 02:07:10,921
Because they still have faith.

2189
02:07:11,561 --> 02:07:14,361
Faith in the judicial system.

2190
02:07:14,881 --> 02:07:18,401
They believe that
if the government

2191
02:07:18,441 --> 02:07:21,801
administration and
police don't listen to them

2192
02:07:21,841 --> 02:07:25,121
the court will hear them out

2193
02:07:25,601 --> 02:07:28,481
and give them justice.

2194
02:07:29,961 --> 02:07:34,841
So every person who
sits on this chair

2195
02:07:35,641 --> 02:07:38,161
has the responsibility
to not break that trust.

2196
02:07:38,801 --> 02:07:43,721
All the witnesses and evidence
presented in this court

2197
02:07:43,921 --> 02:07:46,361
clearly prove one thing.

2198
02:07:46,601 --> 02:07:50,001
Whatever happened on 14th August
on the Gomti river bridge

2199
02:07:50,041 --> 02:07:52,761
was not a coincidental encounter

2200
02:07:53,121 --> 02:07:57,561
but a well-planned,
well-executed murder.

2201
02:07:58,521 --> 02:08:00,241
And so the court

2202
02:07:58,521 --> 02:08:00,241
And so the court

2203
02:08:00,641 --> 02:08:05,161
finds Suryaveer Singh
and his accomplices guilty

2204
02:08:05,601 --> 02:08:09,361
under IPC section 302

2205
02:08:10,001 --> 02:08:13,321
201, 182

2206
02:08:13,761 --> 02:08:17,481
and 340 for murder

2207
02:08:17,801 --> 02:08:19,201
evidence tampering

2208
02:08:19,521 --> 02:08:21,161
misleading the court

2209
02:08:21,201 --> 02:08:25,161
and presenting fake evidence

2210
02:08:25,241 --> 02:08:28,001
and sentences them
to life imprisonment.

2211
02:08:28,801 --> 02:08:32,961
And the court immediately
orders the release

2212
02:08:33,041 --> 02:08:37,521
of late Baldev Singh Bhadoria's son,
Ramkumar Bhadoria.

2213
02:08:37,961 --> 02:08:40,321
The court is adjourned.

2214
02:08:43,801 --> 02:08:45,641
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2215
02:08:47,041 --> 02:08:50,201
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

2216
02:08:50,241 --> 02:08:52,521
Please move!

2217
02:09:35,361 --> 02:09:37,281
Boy, clean the dirt near the
tires as well.

2218
02:09:37,321 --> 02:09:39,201
Scrape it off with your nails.

2219
02:09:39,881 --> 02:09:41,521
Yes, good job.

2220
02:09:43,801 --> 02:09:45,921
Money?
- Oh, yeah.

2221
02:09:46,401 --> 02:09:48,721
Come here.

2222
02:09:53,041 --> 02:09:54,921
What's your name?
- Rubal.

2223
02:09:55,401 --> 02:09:57,481
Rubal!

2224
02:09:58,041 --> 02:09:59,521
We are even now.

2225
02:09:59,561 --> 02:10:02,641
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- Not at all.

2226
02:09:59,561 --> 02:10:02,641
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- Not at all.

2227
02:10:02,721 --> 02:10:03,961
I'm a lawyer.

2228
02:10:04,041 --> 02:10:06,441
See you.

2229
02:10:42,521 --> 02:10:45,641
"Hello, how are you?
My name is Jolly."

2230
02:10:45,681 --> 02:10:49,121
"The gang of friends is out
to celebrate."

2231
02:10:56,321 --> 02:10:58,441
Perfect, cut it!

2232
02:10:58,481 --> 02:10:59,641
Roll, sound!

2233
02:10:59,681 --> 02:11:00,961
Sound rolling!
- Clap.

2234
02:10:59,681 --> 02:11:00,961
Sound rolling!
- Clap.

2235
02:11:01,361 --> 02:11:05,721
Action.
- This Arabic book, based on..

2236
02:11:05,761 --> 02:11:07,961
I forgot my line!

2237
02:11:09,361 --> 02:11:12,881
Which man,
a day after his wedding..

2238
02:11:12,921 --> 02:11:14,601
You say the line.

2239
02:11:15,241 --> 02:11:17,121
You say the line
and I'll repeat it.

2240
02:11:17,961 --> 02:11:20,481
What's that?
What is that?

2241
02:11:20,521 --> 02:11:21,841
"He's a jolly good fellow."

2242
02:11:21,881 --> 02:11:23,641
"He's a jolly good fellow."
- What is that?

2243
02:11:23,681 --> 02:11:26,081
"Hail Lord Krishna.."

2244
02:11:26,121 --> 02:11:29,241
All of Lucknow will talk about me..

2245
02:11:29,281 --> 02:11:31,321
Be it Hazratganj or Kalyan..

2246
02:11:31,361 --> 02:11:34,481
All of Lucknow will talk about me.

2247
02:11:35,241 --> 02:11:37,001
Hazratganj or Kalyan..

2248
02:11:37,601 --> 02:11:39,401
Why am I saying Kalyan?

2249
02:11:49,921 --> 02:11:51,721
Do you see this?

2250
02:11:54,481 --> 02:11:58,281
Massage my legs please.

2251
02:11:58,441 --> 02:12:00,681
Look carefully, this man is alive.

2252
02:11:58,441 --> 02:12:00,681
Look carefully, this man is alive.

2253
02:12:00,721 --> 02:12:02,481
If you don't cut in,
I'll keep rambling.

2254
02:12:02,961 --> 02:12:04,681
It's your dialogue.

2255
02:12:04,761 --> 02:12:06,841
Sir, sign on the petition.

2256
02:12:06,881 --> 02:12:08,281
Sir, please stamp this.
Where did it go?

2257
02:12:08,641 --> 02:12:10,401
Where have you hidden it?

2258
02:12:12,201 --> 02:12:14,401
What's the source of
that information?

2259
02:12:15,241 --> 02:12:17,961
The source is still to be found.

2260
02:12:19,561 --> 02:12:23,841
That day when he planted
the bomb himself

2261
02:12:24,481 --> 02:12:26,161
everyone was blown up.

2262
02:12:27,561 --> 02:12:29,041
What are you doing?

2263
02:12:29,081 --> 02:12:33,121
I will keep protesting regardless
of the media.

2264
02:12:33,441 --> 02:12:35,441
Hey, get up.

2265
02:12:37,161 --> 02:12:38,681
Praise Lord Shiva!

2266
02:12:38,721 --> 02:12:41,841
Praise Lord Shiva!

2267
02:12:44,241 --> 02:12:47,441
Once a tall man.. A very tall man..

2268
02:12:47,481 --> 02:12:50,961
That man hit me here.

2269
02:12:51,681 --> 02:12:53,601
Actually,
I was the one who hit him.

2270
02:12:53,921 --> 02:12:55,481
Pack your bags

2271
02:12:56,321 --> 02:12:57,321
and go to your mother's place.

2272
02:12:57,361 --> 02:13:02,201
"He acts naughty all the time.
- I am an expert."

2273
02:12:57,361 --> 02:13:02,201
"He acts naughty all the time.
- I am an expert."

2274
02:13:02,281 --> 02:13:07,681
"I can fool anyone. If you want,
you can talk to me."

2275
02:13:07,721 --> 02:13:10,641
"He's a jolly good fellow."

2276
02:13:11,081 --> 02:13:14,481
"He's a jolly good fellow."

2277
02:13:18,641 --> 02:13:21,521
Thank you very much
to all the actors. Pack up!

2278
02:13:25,121 --> 02:13:28,601
"He's a jolly good fellow."
