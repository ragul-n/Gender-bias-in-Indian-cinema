1
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:03,547
'Who can conquer the Creator?'

2
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:09,269
'Nobody can harm the
one who is blessed by God.'

3
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:20,004
Be alert.

4
00:01:22,242 --> 00:01:26,108
Be alert.

5
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:30,109
Gudiya will get married to a prince.
- Listen to your brother.

6
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:33,387
My brave son.
- Dad.

7
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:37,149
Look, brother.

8
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:41,309
Who's there?

9
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:44,069
Who is it? Why don't you answer?

10
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,538
Don't shout or else I'll shoot.

11
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,429
I will shoot.
- Shoot me.

12
00:01:54,954 --> 00:01:58,629
If your pain is alleviated
by shooting me..

13
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:59,589
..then go ahead and shoot me.

14
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:02,709
Who is it?
- Nobody, my dear.

15
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,509
A lost brother.

16
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:07,349
Ask him if he's hungry.
I'll serve dinner.

17
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,629
What's there to ask?

18
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,469
I won't let him leave without
having his dinner. - I'll get it.

19
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:19,989
Tell me something.

20
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:22,269
Does your mother know..

21
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:27,349
..that you are badly injured?

22
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:30,349
Brother?

23
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:34,469
The day she finds out,
she'll cry bitterly.

24
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:36,669
So, throw away this weapon.

25
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:43,549
I've taken up this weapon to
defend the rights of our community.

26
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:45,349
For our freedom.

27
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:48,349
Great, my friend.

28
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:52,709
Even Mahatma Gandhi had fought for
our freedom. Did he use any weapon?

29
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:54,029
That..

30
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,029
Stop.

31
00:02:57,589 --> 00:03:00,629
You have invited death.

32
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:03,389
But before dying, eat this bread.

33
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:05,269
Take it. Go.

34
00:03:11,418 --> 00:03:12,709
Villagers..

35
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:17,469
..there is a wounded terrorist.

36
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:21,389
Someone has given him shelter.

37
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,509
Hand him over to us.

38
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:29,389
I will give you ten minutes.

39
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:34,709
If we find him first,
then along with the terrorist..

40
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:37,989
..all the villagers will be punished.
- Inspector.

41
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:40,429
Listen.

42
00:03:41,277 --> 00:03:43,309
I'm the head of this village.

43
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,149
Nobody in this village is
involved in any illegal activities.

44
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:49,233
If you want,
you can search every house.

45
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:53,222
Go away, rascal. Am I your servant?

46
00:03:53,546 --> 00:03:56,422
Why should I search for him?
You'll search for him..

47
00:03:56,606 --> 00:03:59,589
..otherwise, all of you will be killed.
- Why would you kill us?

48
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:01,869
Are there no laws in this village?

49
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:02,909
You are a public servant.

50
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:04,669
So behave like one.
Don't try to rule us like a master.

51
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:08,069
I know the law.
- Scoundrel.

52
00:04:09,914 --> 00:04:11,829
You are teaching me the law?

53
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:14,162
God!

54
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:18,940
Don't make this mistake, inspector..

55
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,549
..or else these villagers will
label you as a terrorist and kill you.

56
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:26,356
They will leave your
body at the police station.

57
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:33,109
Go. Everybody,
go to your houses and go to sleep.

58
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:35,629
Go on.

59
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:40,669
Sir.
- Mahinder.

60
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:44,518
Burn this village.

61
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,109
If he is hiding here,
he'll come out..

62
00:04:49,394 --> 00:04:51,869
..or he'll burn to death.

63
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:55,006
But the innocent villagers
will also be killed.

64
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,330
Let them die.

65
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,989
I don't want to be just
an inspector all my life.

66
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:04,456
I have to become famous.
I have to reach my destination.

67
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:08,867
If I have to kill innocent
people to get there, then I will.

68
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:11,493
Burn this village.

69
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:14,757
If anybody interferes, kill him.

70
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:18,269
Today, I will remind
them about the incident..

71
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:20,629
..at Jalianwala Baug
(A town in Delhi).

72
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:42,749
Run away with the children.
Praise the Lord.

73
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:12,779
Run away with the children! Oh God!

74
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,779
Run, children!

75
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,822
Mummy!

76
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:50,709
No!

77
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:09,095
'According to our information,
this morning at 10am..'

78
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:13,215
'..some terrorists robbed
Faridabad's New City Bank.'

79
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:15,695
Take this. - 'The police have
put up check posts in the city.'

80
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,935
Come, Singha. - Be careful.
If you talk, there will be cheating.

81
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,335
Nitya, serve me tea.

82
00:09:22,538 --> 00:09:24,695
Tea is served. Here.
- Thank you.

83
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,735
Here's your tea.

84
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:28,975
Raj, here's your tea.

85
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:32,135
Brother, I'm scared. I'll fall.
- Bunty.

86
00:09:32,215 --> 00:09:34,895
I don't want to ride it.
- Come. You've been playing all day.

87
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,015
Don't you have any sense?
How many times..

88
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,495
Brother, I will fall.
- No, you won't, Gudiya. I'm holding you.

89
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:45,535
Come home. Come on.

90
00:09:45,966 --> 00:09:48,225
What are you thinking?

91
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:55,036
To discuss this incident, we have
in our studio, D.I.G. Jai Singh Rana.

92
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:01,255
D.I.G., we've heard
that innocent people..

93
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,095
..out of fear of police brutality..

94
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:05,415
..have taken up weapons
and have become terrorists.

95
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:06,895
What is your opinion about that?

96
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,615
It is an absolute lie. It is rubbish.

97
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:12,815
I can't speak about
the entire police force..

98
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:19,455
..but as far as I am concerned,
in a career spanning 23 years..

99
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:23,255
..I have never raised
my hands on an unarmed person.

100
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:29,735
No. Liar. He is lying.

101
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:32,415
No!

102
00:10:32,617 --> 00:10:36,174
This killer is lying. He is lying.

103
00:10:40,336 --> 00:10:42,535
He is lying.

104
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:54,695
Give our ball back to us.

105
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:57,137
Brother, could you
give our ball back to us?

106
00:11:19,335 --> 00:11:20,815
Police.

107
00:11:46,715 --> 00:11:49,775
I know that the terrorists
who robbed the bank yesterday..

108
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:51,535
..are hiding here.

109
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:53,815
I will give you two minutes.

110
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:57,735
Surrender your weapons
or you'll be killed.

111
00:11:57,895 --> 00:12:01,055
You can't.. - There are too many
cops and we don't have enough bullets.

112
00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:02,775
We won't be able to hold
them off for very long.

113
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,295
I'll give you cover from the front.

114
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,215
Escape from the back.
- And you?

115
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:07,975
Don't worry about me.

116
00:12:08,055 --> 00:12:12,815
This is your last warning.
Surrender your weapons.

117
00:12:24,975 --> 00:12:26,055
Fire.

118
00:13:22,771 --> 00:13:27,215
Praise the Lord.

119
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:45,712
Kisan!

120
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:15,535
Raj.

121
00:14:19,883 --> 00:14:22,655
Fire.

122
00:14:58,621 --> 00:15:00,501
Sir.
- Get up.

123
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:03,181
Sir, I am ruined.

124
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:06,941
My four-year-old daughter
perished in this fire.

125
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:09,781
What should I do?
- How did this fire start?

126
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:12,741
How did this fire start?
- Sir, what can we say?

127
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:15,581
Six or seven terrorists
were hiding in this house.

128
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:18,661
In order to get to them,
the police burned down the whole village.

129
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:20,301
The terrorists were killed.

130
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:22,981
And four villagers died as well.

131
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:26,741
What kind of justice is this?
We didn't commit any crime.

132
00:15:26,821 --> 00:15:28,541
There's only one option left.

133
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:31,541
We have to leave our
houses and go somewhere else.

134
00:15:31,621 --> 00:15:33,341
You won't have to go anywhere.

135
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:36,901
This house belongs to you.
This place, this land, belongs to you.

136
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,061
Will you leave your motherland?

137
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:42,941
Stop your speech.

138
00:15:43,021 --> 00:15:45,781
This house belongs to us.
This land belongs to us.

139
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:50,501
If this land belongs to us,
why can't we live here peacefully?

140
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:56,341
Where were you when our
people were being killed?

141
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:00,701
Our children perished in
the fire before our own eyes.

142
00:16:01,141 --> 00:16:05,701
Have you ever seen your
children being burned alive?

143
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:07,501
I have.

144
00:16:07,821 --> 00:16:09,101
I have.

145
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,221
A mother can't see
her child being cremated.

146
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:17,181
And I saw the child..

147
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:22,121
It should have been me instead.
Why didn't I die?

148
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:27,494
Aunt, hit me. Hit me.

149
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:31,861
If hitting me results
in less pain for you..

150
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:33,959
..then I will consider myself lucky.

151
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:38,541
Do you want to alleviate my pain?

152
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:41,381
Then why don't you
explain that to them?

153
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:45,101
They are so young and
they carry weapons with them.

154
00:16:45,181 --> 00:16:50,661
What do they want?
Why are they killing each other?

155
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:52,304
Will you pacify them?

156
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:56,461
I promise you, aunt.
I will go to our loved ones..

157
00:16:56,671 --> 00:16:59,741
..who, for some reason,
are angry with us.

158
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:02,981
I will pacify them.

159
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:05,975
And until they don't
return to their homes..

160
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:08,575
..I will not return
to my house either.

161
00:17:15,655 --> 00:17:18,735
Mr. Satyaprakash, I think it is
futile to talk to these terrorists..

162
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:22,695
..and advice them to give up violence.

163
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,215
They only understand
the language of bullets.

164
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:31,415
Change your decision
about the peace march.

165
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:36,295
I know how to handle them.

166
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,295
It is our task. Let us do it.

167
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:43,175
D.I.G., I've been observing your work.

168
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:45,575
The whole village
perished in the fire.

169
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:48,695
Four innocent people were killed.
Seven policemen were killed as well.

170
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:50,615
Many people became homeless.

171
00:17:50,901 --> 00:17:52,815
There is violence everywhere.

172
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,855
Mr. Satyaprakash,
we killed six terrorists.

173
00:17:57,062 --> 00:17:58,615
Maybe you're not aware.

174
00:17:58,695 --> 00:18:01,815
This incident will give
birth to 50 new terrorists.

175
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:03,041
Maybe you're not aware.

176
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,975
So, why don't you tell
me what we should do?

177
00:18:05,095 --> 00:18:07,095
You won't do anything.

178
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:11,495
Whatever has to be done, I will do it.

179
00:18:11,575 --> 00:18:14,455
This country is mine.
And its people are my people.

180
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:17,135
Is it true that you're going
on a peace march for the country?

181
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,215
Yes.

182
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:19,935
Sir, will it improve the situation?

183
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,495
Somebody has to try.

184
00:18:21,575 --> 00:18:24,135
But, sir,
your life might be in danger.

185
00:18:24,255 --> 00:18:25,169
Nobody knows the future.

186
00:18:25,249 --> 00:18:27,135
Sir, do you believe the terrorists..

187
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:28,895
..will listen to you
and surrender themselves?

188
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:32,295
I have a lot of conviction.

189
00:18:32,672 --> 00:18:35,695
Even if a single
terrorist surrenders..

190
00:18:35,855 --> 00:18:38,135
..I will consider myself lucky.

191
00:19:14,055 --> 00:19:15,695
Raj.

192
00:19:16,976 --> 00:19:18,095
Raj.

193
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:27,255
I thought you were also killed,
along with your friends.

194
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,975
I can't die before Rana does.

195
00:19:35,255 --> 00:19:39,175
Do you know who has killed my friends?

196
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:44,495
That same killer, Jai Singh Rana.

197
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:48,895
Had I known that Rana is
the leader of the police force..

198
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:52,295
..I would have killed him
then and there. Right there.

199
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,735
Everything is over, Raj.

200
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:59,135
You'd better forget about Rana.
- What?

201
00:19:59,646 --> 00:20:01,895
What should I forget?

202
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,095
Should I forget that I had a father?

203
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,335
That he didn't die of natural
causes because Rana killed him.

204
00:20:08,186 --> 00:20:13,375
Should I forget that
I had a mother who raised me?

205
00:20:14,415 --> 00:20:15,535
Should I forget that my sister,..

206
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,375
..while tying me a rakhi (a thread
symbolising sisterly affection)..

207
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:19,775
..thought that I would protect her?

208
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:25,601
Should I forget that when I
should have been playing with toys..

209
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:29,855
..that scoundrel forced
me to take this gun?

210
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:33,815
I can't forget it.
I can't forget anything.

211
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:36,415
If you want me to forget all that..

212
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,415
..take this gun and shoot me.

213
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:46,135
For, as long as I live,
I will seek vengeance.

214
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:48,655
Shoot me.

215
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:54,135
Raj, you're so desperate to kill Rana.

216
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:59,215
Even God is unable to do anything
in the face of such madness.

217
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,695
I'm just a human being.

218
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:09,255
Right now, D.I.G. Rana is in
charge of Mr. Satyaprakash's security.

219
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:13,975
So, he will have
many policemen with him.

220
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:17,455
And many innocent people
will be around him.

221
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:22,655
But as soon as the peace
march reaches Sunder Nagar..

222
00:21:23,175 --> 00:21:26,895
..the police and Rana will relax..

223
00:21:28,215 --> 00:21:30,575
..and your task will become easier.

224
00:21:35,535 --> 00:21:37,415
This is the money which
was stolen from the bank.

225
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:42,455
I'll make arrangements to
deliver the weapons in Sunder Nagar.

226
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,015
And yes..

227
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,895
..I'll also give you
a letter for Daya Shankar.

228
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:50,935
He will arrange for your lodging.

229
00:22:14,895 --> 00:22:16,455
What happened, driver uncle?

230
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:21,055
Baby, the petrol pipe is busted.
- Oh, great. You had it, oldie.

231
00:22:21,135 --> 00:22:22,535
I don't understand.

232
00:22:22,615 --> 00:22:25,095
Get the car repaired and go home.

233
00:22:25,175 --> 00:22:27,015
I'll hitchhike and
make my way home. Okay?

234
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,575
Hitchhike?
- Where there's a will, there's a way.

235
00:22:29,655 --> 00:22:33,855
And here comes the bus. Bye.

236
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:40,575
Stop. Stop the bus, man. Stop.

237
00:22:41,015 --> 00:22:42,695
Sorry.

238
00:22:44,015 --> 00:22:47,655
Excuse me. Can I?

239
00:22:48,215 --> 00:22:49,935
Please.

240
00:22:50,255 --> 00:22:54,255
Will you please make room for me?

241
00:22:55,095 --> 00:22:59,575
I mean, please move aside.
Please. Okay?

242
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,175
Thank you.

243
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:05,575
Thank you.

244
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,855
Looks like you didn't
sleep well last night.

245
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:14,575
Friend, what a girl. She is great.

246
00:23:14,735 --> 00:23:17,975
She is really gorgeous. Oh, God.

247
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:25,295
Friend, today is your lucky day.
Here comes another.

248
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:28,935
You're unlucky. She is pregnant.

249
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,655
Please have my seat.
- She is pregnant.

250
00:23:31,855 --> 00:23:33,455
Thank you. - Great.

251
00:23:33,535 --> 00:23:36,175
I will go sit. - Go on.
- Here I go.

252
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,895
He got up from his seat,
so that she could sit there and you..

253
00:23:39,015 --> 00:23:42,455
Yes, me. Hey, beautiful.
- Shut up, silly.

254
00:23:42,695 --> 00:23:44,215
Don't you have any respect for women?

255
00:23:44,455 --> 00:23:47,756
Don't talk too much
or I'll teach you a lesson.

256
00:23:47,836 --> 00:23:50,655
If you are so concerned,
why don't you sit on my lap?

257
00:23:50,735 --> 00:23:54,695
Let this pregnant woman
sit beside you, right?

258
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:56,495
Am I right?

259
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:14,534
Wow. Great.

260
00:24:14,614 --> 00:24:17,375
He picked them up and punched them.
They went right through the glass.

261
00:24:17,535 --> 00:24:20,375
He punched the next guy and he
went right through the glass as well.

262
00:24:20,455 --> 00:24:23,655
You were fabulous. Hi, I'm Rani.

263
00:24:23,935 --> 00:24:25,415
He is sleeping already.

264
00:24:25,495 --> 00:24:27,535
Whoever wants to eat can do so.

265
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:29,895
The bus will stop here
for ten minutes only.

266
00:24:30,815 --> 00:24:34,495
"Youth."

267
00:24:34,783 --> 00:24:41,375
"Everyone goes through it,
but you are too youthful."

268
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,855
"Crazy girl."

269
00:24:47,095 --> 00:24:55,095
"The whole world becomes crazy, but
you've become crazier than the rest."

270
00:25:12,975 --> 00:25:17,415
"Scarlet skirt."

271
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:33,015
"Scarlet skirt."

272
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:49,855
"Everybody is crazy about it."

273
00:25:54,935 --> 00:26:01,695
"Swaying and swirling.
It has made everyone crazy."

274
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:09,135
"Everybody is floored
by its silver anklets."

275
00:26:10,775 --> 00:26:15,855
"Swaying and swirling.
It has made everyone crazy."

276
00:26:15,935 --> 00:26:21,535
"Everybody is floored
by its silver anklets."

277
00:26:21,615 --> 00:26:26,335
"It kills everybody.
- The skirt."

278
00:26:26,455 --> 00:26:31,443
"Scarlet skirt."

279
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:39,844
"My scarlet skirt."

280
00:27:24,055 --> 00:27:28,895
"Scarlet skirt."

281
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,895
"My heart is beating faster."

282
00:27:31,975 --> 00:27:34,526
"Where did this stranger come from?"

283
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:37,067
"His every glance is striking."

284
00:27:37,147 --> 00:27:38,907
"How do I express my plight?"

285
00:27:38,987 --> 00:27:41,707
"Look at this. She has gone crazy."

286
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:44,387
"Friends, save her."

287
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:50,147
"She is losing control. Restrain her."

288
00:27:50,227 --> 00:27:54,907
"Scarlet skirt."

289
00:27:55,507 --> 00:28:00,707
"Now days pass in agony."

290
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:03,467
"Once the poison of
love spreads inside you.."

291
00:28:03,547 --> 00:28:06,467
"..it is difficult to get rid of it."

292
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:11,107
"It kills everybody. - The skirt."

293
00:28:11,227 --> 00:28:15,987
"Scarlet skirt."

294
00:28:18,787 --> 00:28:24,187
"My scarlet skirt."

295
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:57,947
"Scarlet skirt."

296
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,707
"I have long black hair.
My waist is enticing."

297
00:29:00,787 --> 00:29:03,267
"Millions desire me."

298
00:29:03,387 --> 00:29:05,747
"All of India is crazy about me."

299
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,747
"My mannerisms are appealing."

300
00:29:07,827 --> 00:29:13,107
"You are too young.
You are inexperienced."

301
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:18,907
"Hide yourself.
Everyone has an eye on you."

302
00:29:19,027 --> 00:29:23,747
"Scarlet skirt."

303
00:29:24,307 --> 00:29:29,507
"Look, don't touch it, beloved."

304
00:29:29,587 --> 00:29:35,147
"It emits flames of merriment."

305
00:29:35,227 --> 00:29:39,867
"It kills everybody.
- The skirt."

306
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:44,267
"Scarlet skirt."

307
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:52,225
"My scarlet skirt."

308
00:29:52,305 --> 00:30:03,027
"Everybody is crazy about it."

309
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:07,867
"Scarlet skirt."

310
00:30:08,747 --> 00:30:15,347
"Scarlet skirt."

311
00:30:15,527 --> 00:30:17,447
This is Sunder Nagar. Excuse me.

312
00:30:17,527 --> 00:30:18,927
Do you know where Shahi Theatre is?

313
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:21,607
I don't know. I'm new in this city.

314
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:24,567
I'm from here. I know my way around.

315
00:30:24,847 --> 00:30:27,527
If you do, then why are you asking me?

316
00:30:28,303 --> 00:30:31,207
By the way I'm Rani.
Want to be friends?

317
00:30:32,336 --> 00:30:35,327
Not every person who offers his hand
in friendship turns out to be a friend.

318
00:30:36,887 --> 00:30:39,567
Don't be my friend.
At least tell me your name.

319
00:30:39,752 --> 00:30:41,847
By the way, what's that?

320
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:44,007
That? That's Town Hall.

321
00:30:44,087 --> 00:30:45,727
And behind Town Hall is Mall Road.

322
00:30:45,847 --> 00:30:47,127
There is a KD store in Mall road.

323
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:49,807
KD store is the largest
departmental store of this city.

324
00:30:49,887 --> 00:30:52,567
By the way that is my grand..

325
00:30:54,247 --> 00:30:55,807
He left without telling me his name.

326
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:59,847
"Hail Mother Goddess."

327
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:02,247
Yes. What do you want?

328
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,167
I have come from Sanewal.

329
00:31:05,327 --> 00:31:07,887
You could be from Sanewal or Garhwal.

330
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:10,327
Firstly, tell me who are you.

331
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:11,727
Whom do you want to meet?

332
00:31:11,807 --> 00:31:14,687
I want to meet Daya Shankar.
- Then meet him.

333
00:31:14,887 --> 00:31:19,447
Are you Daya Shankar? - Of course.
Do I look like Sushmita Sen?

334
00:31:19,527 --> 00:31:22,887
No. I mean..
- I told you I'm Daya Shankar.

335
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:25,927
Now do you want the entire
village to testify to that?

336
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:29,127
This letter is for you.
- I don't want to read it.

337
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:31,767
If you don't read the letter,
I'll be in trouble.

338
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:32,447
Trouble.

339
00:31:32,527 --> 00:31:36,407
As long as Daya Shankar
is here nobody can harm Badal.

340
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,087
Do you know me?

341
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:40,927
I don't only know you..

342
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:44,887
I also know what is in your bag.
- How?

343
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:47,607
Mantaveer had called
from Delhi early this morning.

344
00:31:47,687 --> 00:31:50,567
Aren't you the younger
brother-in-law of..

345
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:53,527
..Dharshan's aunt's
sister-in-law's aunt?

346
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:58,487
He even told me you
are a skilled craftsman.

347
00:31:58,854 --> 00:32:04,927
You had me tensed.
- It's an old habit of mine to make jokes.

348
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:09,647
An Indian always lives merrily.
Give me five.

349
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:16,207
Thief. Thief. My purse.

350
00:32:16,287 --> 00:32:19,887
My money.
Somebody nab him. He stole my money.

351
00:32:20,487 --> 00:32:23,127
Thief. Thief. Somebody catch him.

352
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:26,167
Catch him.
He took away my purse. Thief. Thief.

353
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:28,607
You. Stop.
- Stop him.

354
00:32:28,687 --> 00:32:29,927
Stop.

355
00:32:30,007 --> 00:32:31,847
Daya Shankar, stop him.

356
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:34,527
Stop or I'll shoot. - No, Sahab Singh.

357
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:39,487
Get up.

358
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:41,567
You rob people..

359
00:32:46,727 --> 00:32:48,087
..for small sums of money.

360
00:32:48,247 --> 00:32:50,927
Sir, this is my purse. My money.

361
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:52,367
Is it your purse? - Yes, sir.

362
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:53,847
Fine.

363
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:56,007
You can go.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

364
00:32:56,247 --> 00:32:59,927
Tell me.
- I'm not a thief.

365
00:33:00,007 --> 00:33:02,647
That's what every thief
says after being caught.

366
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:05,527
No, sir. Today is the
last date to pay my exams fees.

367
00:33:05,607 --> 00:33:07,807
I had to make the payment.

368
00:33:07,887 --> 00:33:12,367
Sir, if I don't make the payment
today, my future will be ruined.

369
00:33:12,853 --> 00:33:16,527
How much are your fees?
- Rs. 1200.

370
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,739
Sahab Singh, release him.

371
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:25,425
Take this and go straight to college,
understood?

372
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:28,967
Enough. Enough. That's fine. Go.

373
00:33:29,448 --> 00:33:33,134
Listen.
- Yes.

374
00:33:33,372 --> 00:33:36,907
Don't stoop so low in
the bigger examination of life.

375
00:33:36,987 --> 00:33:39,007
Understood? Go on.

376
00:33:40,712 --> 00:33:42,552
Sir, you let him go.

377
00:33:42,632 --> 00:33:45,912
He should have been punished
so that he won't do this again.

378
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:50,072
Punishment will only
brand him as a thief.

379
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:53,192
Soon after that he'll
become a big criminal.

380
00:33:53,552 --> 00:33:58,672
Sahab Singh, our Indian
boys are killed not with bullets..

381
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:01,112
..but with sweet talks.

382
00:34:01,383 --> 00:34:02,872
I'm sorry, sir.

383
00:34:04,183 --> 00:34:05,392
Well done.

384
00:34:05,552 --> 00:34:08,032
Today, you've not only
saved an innocent person..

385
00:34:08,192 --> 00:34:11,392
..but you've also saved a police
officer from committing a crime.

386
00:34:11,771 --> 00:34:13,392
Thank you.

387
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:16,952
I've never seen you before.
- Actually..

388
00:34:17,032 --> 00:34:19,832
..sir, he is one of our own.
He's from our village.

389
00:34:20,152 --> 00:34:21,872
From Sanewal?
- Yes.

390
00:34:22,063 --> 00:34:23,992
Actually, he is my distant relative.

391
00:34:24,072 --> 00:34:26,272
Haddamo's brother-in-law.
- What?

392
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,472
Yes. But since the last ten years
he has been living in our village.

393
00:34:29,772 --> 00:34:32,792
He has grown up.
He has come here in search for a job.

394
00:34:32,972 --> 00:34:34,392
During the day he
will work at the shop.

395
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,672
And he will sleep here.

396
00:34:36,872 --> 00:34:40,712
Very good. Sanewal.
- Yes.

397
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:42,952
Daya Shankar.
- Yes.

398
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:45,912
Where are you from?
- Your village. Sanewal.

399
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:48,712
From where has he come from?
- From Sanewal.

400
00:34:48,832 --> 00:34:52,672
If you can live in my house,
then why can't he?

401
00:34:52,752 --> 00:34:55,872
That's very nice of you, sir.
Give me five.

402
00:34:58,272 --> 00:35:03,592
Grab your luggage and come along.
- I..

403
00:35:03,752 --> 00:35:08,032
What? What is your name?

404
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:10,432
Badal.
- Badal.

405
00:35:10,512 --> 00:35:14,432
You are an adult.
Why should you be shy?

406
00:35:14,552 --> 00:35:16,872
Come on.
- Come.

407
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:18,472
Take your luggage.

408
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:25,472
Mom, save me.
- Preeti.

409
00:35:25,552 --> 00:35:28,112
Mom, save me. - Preeti, I said, "Stop."
- Papa, look at her.

410
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:29,712
What happened?

411
00:35:29,872 --> 00:35:31,952
Papa, I was talking on the
phone and she pulled the wire.

412
00:35:32,032 --> 00:35:33,912
Why?
- No, Papa. It is half-truth and half-lie.

413
00:35:33,992 --> 00:35:35,432
Sister was talking to brother-in-law.

414
00:35:35,512 --> 00:35:36,952
When I told her that I wanted to talk,
she didn't give me the phone.

415
00:35:37,032 --> 00:35:38,512
So I pulled the wire. - Really?

416
00:35:38,592 --> 00:35:39,872
I won't give it back.
- You will pull the wire.

417
00:35:39,952 --> 00:35:41,992
Stop the fighting. Stop. Stop.

418
00:35:42,192 --> 00:35:44,872
And look who has come to our house.

419
00:35:46,683 --> 00:35:49,472
Who is it?
- Have a look.

420
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:53,912
Simran, he is Badal.

421
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:56,912
Hello.
- He will stay with us.

422
00:35:56,992 --> 00:36:01,764
Badal, she is Soni,
my elder daughter. - Hello.

423
00:36:01,844 --> 00:36:03,752
She is studying in her final year.

424
00:36:03,832 --> 00:36:08,618
Very soon she'll get
married and leave us. - Papa!

425
00:36:08,912 --> 00:36:11,352
I am not going to
leave this house so soon.

426
00:36:11,432 --> 00:36:13,352
I'm in the 6th grade.

427
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:16,792
By the way, my name is Manpreet,
but you can call me Preeti.

428
00:36:16,952 --> 00:36:19,312
I study in the Central School.
And I am learning computers.

429
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,420
Do you know computers?

430
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,460
No problem. I will teach you..

431
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:29,140
..but on one condition.
You have to be my friend.

432
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:37,580
That's fine. - Guest's are like God.
Preeti knows that.

433
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,740
He looks like a demon to me.
- Keep quiet.

434
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,380
Come. Welcome.

435
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,900
Welcome.

436
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,980
Did you like the house?

437
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,860
It's good. But..
- What do you mean?

438
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,100
I'd rather stay in the garage.

439
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,140
What's wrong with this house?

440
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,500
It is a nice bungalow.
Delicious meals.

441
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,300
You will live a luxurious life.

442
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,260
And there is no fear of being robbed..

443
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,220
..at such a senior
police officer's house.

444
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,620
Also, the people of
the city will respect you.

445
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,020
There can't be a
better place than this..

446
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,860
..in entire Sunder Nagar.
Give me five.

447
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,280
There is a young girl in the house.

448
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,480
And you have brought a stranger here.

449
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,800
Darling, he is not a stranger.
He is Daya Shankar's relative.

450
00:37:28,196 --> 00:37:33,840
And most importantly, he's from
the same village where I was born.

451
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,760
Really? Bring the entire village here.

452
00:37:36,952 --> 00:37:39,280
I'll go to my mom's with my daughters.

453
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,800
My darling,
you can be condescending if you want.

454
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,760
Demote me from an assistant
commissioner to a constable..

455
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,880
..but don't threaten to
go to your mom's. I feel sad.

456
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,760
Enough of your drama.

457
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,840
Dinner is ready.
Go and fetch your villager. Go.

458
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,240
You are unnecessarily
worried about that guy.

459
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,520
I feel very strange
when I look at him.

460
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,080
Did you see his eyes?
They are so silent.

461
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,000
And did you see my eyes?

462
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,880
There is so much of chaos in them.

463
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,440
Give me a sweet kiss.
- Go away.

464
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,440
Badal.

465
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,000
You're still awake?
- Actually..

466
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,720
..it is cold at night.

467
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,640
Keep the blanket..

468
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,400
..or you'll catch a cold. - Okay.

469
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,320
I'll leave now.

470
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,600
Good night.

471
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,200
Have you gone mad?
You want to pacify the terrorists.

472
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,800
Don't vex yourself uselessly.
Nothing will happen to me.

473
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,720
Terrorists are also human,
like you and me.

474
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,760
Listen to me very carefully.

475
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,040
I won't allow you to
go beyond Sunder Nagar.

476
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,960
That area is very dangerous.

477
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,040
Fine. We will talk when we meet.

478
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,760
Take care, okay?
- Bye.

479
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,480
Merry Christmas, Grandpa. What's this?

480
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,680
You got emotional on the phone.

481
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,640
Who were you talking to?
Your girlfriend?

482
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,920
Fool. - Tell me, grandpa.
Don't change the topic.

483
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,560
If your girlfriend is upset with you,
I'll appease her..

484
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,000
..by bringing up your
age in conversation.

485
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,480
Tell me, grandpa. Tell me.

486
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,960
I'm not talking to
you as my girlfriend.

487
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,160
I am talking to you as somebody
I grew up with, Satyaprakash.

488
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,560
He will meet the terrorists.

489
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,120
He will pacify them.
- Terrorists.

490
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,560
How exciting..

491
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,440
..meeting terrorists, talking to them.

492
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,000
By the way, grandpa.
Have you ever seen a terrorist?

493
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,800
I have.
- Where?

494
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,720
Tell me. When? Where?

495
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,440
She's standing before me.
- Grandpa!

496
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,640
Sahab Singh, so early in the morning?
Is everything fine?

497
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,680
The collector has called
you for an urgent meeting..

498
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,720
..regarding the peace march.
- Papa, what about college?

499
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,240
Sorry, love.
Could you walk to college today?

500
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,040
Badal.
- Yes.

501
00:40:12,421 --> 00:40:15,640
Will you do me a favour?
Will you drop Soni to her college?

502
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,120
Me?
- And why don't you take my bike.

503
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,160
And get the clutch and
break checked on your way back.

504
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,120
I have to open the garage.
I'm leaving.

505
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,360
Go on.

506
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,840
Soni. Is there a shortage
of men in college..

507
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,280
..that you've brought
this fool from the outside?

508
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,160
He's probably one of A.C.P's goons..

509
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,120
..that's serving time.

510
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,840
We are also ready to serve time.

511
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,960
Darling, we are still alive.

512
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,320
Please go home.

513
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,960
But this..
- This is routine stuff.

514
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,320
Girls are used to
hearing such comments.

515
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,000
If this happens everyday, why
didn't you complain to your father?

516
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,280
What's the use?
Father will lock them up.

517
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,040
And they will be
released the next day.

518
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,680
One is a minister's son
and the other is an MLA's son.

519
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,920
My studies would be
stopped unnecessarily.

520
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,080
And why are you so worried?

521
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,000
You won't come to escort me everyday.
- Hi Soni.

522
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,800
Hi Rashmi.

523
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,865
Today these guys
have crossed the limit.

524
00:41:44,945 --> 00:41:46,600
Let's go away from here.

525
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:52,364
This is for my mummy.
This is for my elder brother.

526
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,640
This is for my younger sister.
- And what am I for?

527
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,920
You are here to pay the bill.
- Oh, God.

528
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,240
Oh, God. - What happened?

529
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,480
He bumped into me.
- You bumped into my wife?

530
00:42:04,258 --> 00:42:06,840
Aren't you ashamed?
We are on our honeymoon. Understand?

531
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,280
We just came here today.
You should apologise to her.

532
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,480
Let it be, Guler. He is handsome..

533
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,640
..just like Dharmendra.

534
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,680
Have you come for our honeymoon
or to look at other men?

535
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,040
He's handsome? So am I a goon?

536
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,720
Where did he go? He got scared.

537
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,960
He doesn't know me.

538
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,960
Let it be. I know what you are.
- What do you know?

539
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,480
Yes.
- Is your father an astrologer?

540
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,560
Don't talk about my father.
- Don't lock horns with me.

541
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,000
What will you do?
- You will fight with me?

542
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,920
Yes.
- You want to fight. - Yes.

543
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,840
You want to fight with your husband.
- Fight with my husband.

544
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,120
On the street?
- On the street.

545
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,920
Am I from the streets?
- Yes.

546
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,280
Really? - Yes.
- What will it be?

547
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,600
Arm wrestling.
- Come on. - Come on.

548
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,440
Come on.
- Use your strength.

549
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,520
I lost?
- You lost.

550
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,720
I lost?
- Yes.

551
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
Come to the hotel.
I'll turn my loss into a win.

552
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,280
Carry the luggage.

553
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,800
This is a nice set.

554
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,640
Oh, my God.

555
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,720
Yes, sir.
- Hi, I'm Rani.

556
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,720
Today you'll have
to tell me your name.

557
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,280
What is your name?
- Eveready.

558
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,560
Eveready? - Okay.

559
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,640
Is that your name?
- I want a big Eveready torch.

560
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,000
Look, you'll get everything you want.
It's my shop.

561
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,720
I want a hook and a 30-feet long rope.

562
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,276
It should be able to carry my weight.

563
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,840
You will get a torch,
but you won't get a hook and rope.

564
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,560
I'll get it from another shop.

565
00:43:31,758 --> 00:43:36,800
If you are so adamant,
take the hook and rope as well.

566
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,080
But at least tell me your name.

567
00:43:40,732 --> 00:43:42,880
I should,
at least, know the person's name..

568
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,880
..who is going to use
my rope to commit suicide.

569
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,040
Why? Do you want to marry me?

570
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,447
I want to lodge
a complaint with the police.

571
00:43:52,527 --> 00:43:53,640
Do you want my photograph?

572
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,800
For the time being, pay the bill.

573
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,680
Okay. It will be okay.

574
00:45:02,275 --> 00:45:04,155
Yes, Rashmi,
tell me, how come you're still awake?

575
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:06,881
Not just me, everyone
in the girl's hostel is awake.

576
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:09,395
Do you know what happened
to those four goons..

577
00:45:09,515 --> 00:45:11,195
..who used to tease you every day?

578
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:15,635
What? - Someone came and
thrashed them black and blue.

579
00:45:15,715 --> 00:45:18,595
They've been admitted to the hospital.
- What are you saying?

580
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:21,755
Your dad probably got
those goons beaten up.

581
00:45:21,835 --> 00:45:24,816
Good for you.
They deserved to be thrashed.

582
00:45:25,919 --> 00:45:28,903
Soni, are you there? Hello?

583
00:45:28,983 --> 00:45:30,762
Soni. Hello.

584
00:45:40,676 --> 00:45:43,355
Have you been to the hostel?

585
00:45:44,979 --> 00:45:47,412
Hostel? What hostel?

586
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:52,379
Don't lie to me. I know everything.

587
00:45:52,969 --> 00:45:53,939
What?

588
00:45:54,259 --> 00:45:59,419
You had those guys beaten up
because they were teasing me.

589
00:46:00,786 --> 00:46:03,739
Why would I beat anyone for you?

590
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,579
What is our relation?

591
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:12,179
Your hand is bleeding.

592
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:14,739
Let it be.

593
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,779
It doesn't matter.
Everyone feels the..

594
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:19,099
..pain regardless of
whether they're bleeding.

595
00:46:19,979 --> 00:46:24,099
For those that are close to you,
but not for strangers.

596
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:29,179
I have to nurse your hand.

597
00:46:31,845 --> 00:46:33,939
Today, I am bandaging your hand.

598
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:36,299
Tomorrow I'll tie rakhi (symbol of
sisterly love) on these wrists, brother.

599
00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:54,057
Today on the occasion
of Sunder Nagar's..

600
00:46:54,217 --> 00:46:55,697
..annual skating competition,
the winner..

601
00:46:55,937 --> 00:46:58,657
..will receive a reward
from our respected collector.

602
00:46:58,977 --> 00:47:02,577
We will have to wait in anticipation
to see who that lucky winner is.

603
00:47:09,057 --> 00:47:12,617
Best of luck.
- Thank you.

604
00:47:17,217 --> 00:47:20,977
Girls, take your position.

605
00:47:25,897 --> 00:47:27,937
Yes.

606
00:47:31,377 --> 00:47:34,937
Badal, my sister will win. Watch.

607
00:47:38,377 --> 00:47:41,897
And now the first round begins.

608
00:48:10,817 --> 00:48:12,737
And this is the hurdles round.

609
00:48:12,977 --> 00:48:14,617
Whoever crosses the hurdles..

610
00:48:14,697 --> 00:48:16,937
..will come closer to winning.

611
00:48:33,617 --> 00:48:36,377
And now begins the semi-final round.

612
00:48:36,457 --> 00:48:39,457
That's the ballet round.

613
00:48:51,057 --> 00:48:54,257
Badal, watch.
My sister will win for sure.

614
00:49:17,897 --> 00:49:20,977
And now we begin the final round.

615
00:49:21,097 --> 00:49:23,497
The round that separates
the winners from the loser.

616
00:49:23,617 --> 00:49:27,217
On one hand we have Soni
and on the other is Rani.

617
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:56,576
Best of luck.

618
00:50:21,177 --> 00:50:25,897
Badal, please do something.

619
00:50:27,297 --> 00:50:30,177
Badal, please do something.

620
00:50:30,937 --> 00:50:36,097
Badal, please do something.

621
00:50:56,937 --> 00:50:59,457
Badal deserves half the prize.

622
00:50:59,537 --> 00:51:01,918
That was a nice trick.

623
00:51:01,998 --> 00:51:03,453
Trick? What do you mean?

624
00:51:03,533 --> 00:51:06,217
You were losing.
I told him to assist you.

625
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:09,417
So Badal rolled the coin because
of which she had an accident.

626
00:51:09,497 --> 00:51:11,577
That's really what secured
your victory. - What?

627
00:51:11,983 --> 00:51:13,297
That's shameful.

628
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:16,697
I would prefer to lose
than win like this. - Hey, guys.

629
00:51:16,777 --> 00:51:20,097
It's cool. Don't worry.
I'll definitely win the next tournament.

630
00:51:20,275 --> 00:51:21,875
Don't worry.
- Excuse me.

631
00:51:21,955 --> 00:51:24,177
Yes. Bye.
- Bye.

632
00:51:24,427 --> 00:51:25,897
Hi. - Hi.
- Congratulations.

633
00:51:26,146 --> 00:51:29,054
Thank you.
But you are the real winner.

634
00:51:29,134 --> 00:51:31,076
No. I fell.

635
00:51:31,156 --> 00:51:34,377
You didn't fall.
You were made to fall. - What?

636
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,217
My brother did that.

637
00:51:38,297 --> 00:51:43,097
I see. So he is your brother.

638
00:51:43,616 --> 00:51:46,257
Come here.

639
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,718
Apologise to her.

640
00:51:50,798 --> 00:51:53,137
Everything is fair
in love and war. Come on.

641
00:51:53,217 --> 00:51:56,137
Sister, can I have a cold drink,
please? - Preeti, stop.

642
00:51:59,495 --> 00:52:02,577
I'm sorry.
- I don't mind falling..

643
00:52:02,817 --> 00:52:05,377
..If you'll be there to hold me.

644
00:52:06,177 --> 00:52:09,137
At least, now tell me your name..

645
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:14,017
..or I won't forgive you.
- Badal.

646
00:52:20,572 --> 00:52:22,092
Badal.

647
00:52:25,612 --> 00:52:32,012
"The heart is afraid to meet those
that we might give our consent to."

648
00:52:33,292 --> 00:52:40,332
"The heart is afraid to meet those
that we might give our consent to."

649
00:52:40,892 --> 00:52:45,452
"Don't meet.."

650
00:52:45,932 --> 00:52:51,012
"Don't meet me frequently.
We might fall in love."

651
00:52:51,092 --> 00:52:53,692
"We might fall in love."

652
00:52:53,772 --> 00:52:56,052
"We might fall in love."

653
00:52:58,972 --> 00:53:05,692
"The heart is afraid to meet those
that we might give our consent to."

654
00:53:06,532 --> 00:53:13,532
"The heart is afraid to meet those
that we might give our consent to."

655
00:53:14,052 --> 00:53:18,692
"Don't meet.. "

656
00:53:19,172 --> 00:53:24,292
"Don't meet me frequently.
We might fall in love."

657
00:53:24,372 --> 00:53:26,972
"We might fall in love."

658
00:53:27,052 --> 00:53:30,932
"We might fall in love."

659
00:53:39,652 --> 00:53:47,092
"This fervor, the heart doesn't know."

660
00:53:47,252 --> 00:53:50,492
"This fervor,
the heart doesn't listen."

661
00:53:50,572 --> 00:53:55,212
"Look, don't love me like this.
Oh, darling."

662
00:53:55,572 --> 00:54:00,092
"In the path of love,
there is pain and sorrow."

663
00:54:00,172 --> 00:54:05,132
"We are so near and yet so far."

664
00:54:05,252 --> 00:54:10,052
"Why are we helpless in love?"

665
00:54:13,219 --> 00:54:19,172
"Your glance may strike my heart."

666
00:54:20,852 --> 00:54:25,812
"Don't meet.."

667
00:54:25,932 --> 00:54:31,052
"Don't meet me frequently.
We might fall in love."

668
00:54:31,132 --> 00:54:33,452
"We might fall in love."

669
00:54:33,532 --> 00:54:37,852
"We might fall in love."

670
00:55:19,564 --> 00:55:25,212
"Don't make me crazy."

671
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:30,372
"Craziness says there's
no control over love."

672
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:35,132
"Oh, my love, my darling."

673
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:39,932
"This affection might turn into love."

674
00:55:40,012 --> 00:55:45,092
"What's this angst?
What is this state of being?"

675
00:55:45,172 --> 00:55:50,612
"We are not conscious of anything."

676
00:55:53,172 --> 00:55:59,852
"To live and die
might become difficult."

677
00:56:00,772 --> 00:56:05,532
"Don't meet.."

678
00:56:05,772 --> 00:56:11,012
"Don't meet me frequently.
We might fall in love."

679
00:56:11,092 --> 00:56:13,412
"We might fall in love."

680
00:56:13,492 --> 00:56:16,292
"We might fall in love."

681
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:21,372
"The heart is afraid to meet those
that we might give our consent to."

682
00:56:21,452 --> 00:56:26,412
"Don't meet me frequently.
We might fall in love."

683
00:56:26,492 --> 00:56:29,052
"We might fall in love."

684
00:56:29,132 --> 00:56:32,012
"We might fall in love."

685
00:56:32,092 --> 00:56:37,172
"Like the cloud."

686
00:56:37,252 --> 00:56:42,172
"The star of my heart."

687
00:56:42,252 --> 00:56:47,612
"The twinkle of my eye."

688
00:56:47,692 --> 00:56:52,372
"The lovelorn one is yearning."

689
00:56:52,852 --> 00:56:57,332
"The star of my heart."
- I love you.

690
00:56:58,012 --> 00:57:02,132
"The star of my heart."
- I love you.

691
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:04,471
I love you.

692
00:57:34,676 --> 00:57:38,796
Go on. With the help of the villagers,
bring the goods here.

693
00:57:38,876 --> 00:57:40,436
Yes, sir.

694
00:57:50,276 --> 00:57:52,076
Did you see this?

695
00:57:53,076 --> 00:57:55,836
This is what our neighboring
country is sending us as a gift?

696
00:57:55,916 --> 00:57:57,716
Sir, there are lots
of explosives in this.

697
00:57:57,796 --> 00:58:00,036
It has the ability to kill hundreds.

698
00:58:05,436 --> 00:58:08,036
What are you all looking at?

699
00:58:09,128 --> 00:58:10,796
Run.

700
00:58:30,956 --> 00:58:32,596
Greetings, Rana. Greetings.

701
00:58:32,796 --> 00:58:34,636
Come, Asgar.
- Greetings.

702
00:58:34,716 --> 00:58:38,276
Take your belongings.
- Rafiq, pick it up. Quickly.

703
00:58:38,356 --> 00:58:40,396
Come on.
- Come.

704
00:58:42,236 --> 00:58:44,916
Rana, according to my promise..

705
00:58:45,036 --> 00:58:48,956
..your money will be deposited
in your bank account.

706
00:58:49,036 --> 00:58:50,876
No, Asgar.

707
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:54,716
I have closed all
bank accounts in India.

708
00:58:56,716 --> 00:58:59,716
This is my Swiss bank account number.

709
00:59:00,928 --> 00:59:04,036
Deposit it in this account. - Okay.

710
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:09,636
Rafiq, leave one box behind.

711
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:12,036
I'll have to show something
to the government.

712
00:59:12,676 --> 00:59:16,596
I'll leave now. Goodbye. Come on.

713
00:59:19,156 --> 00:59:22,116
Hello. Control room.
- Yes, sir.

714
00:59:22,724 --> 00:59:25,396
This is D.I.G.
Jai Singh Rana speaking. - Sir.

715
00:59:25,589 --> 00:59:30,036
Listen carefully. I've apprehended
the terrorists' explosives.

716
00:59:30,216 --> 00:59:33,076
Five terrorists were
killed in the encounter.

717
00:59:33,631 --> 00:59:36,796
One officer and a driver
were killed as well.

718
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:39,716
Send the police force..

719
00:59:39,796 --> 00:59:42,116
..and ambulance to Malay
Kotla village immediately. Over.

720
00:59:42,918 --> 00:59:45,170
Study this list carefully.

721
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:49,490
I want all these explosives
before the 15th of August.

722
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:54,850
So many explosives? Do you
want to blow up the entire city?

723
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:01,770
I heard Asgar is only
concerned about his money.

724
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:04,850
He doesn't go into the details.

725
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:08,050
There is certain style in your talk.

726
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:12,050
I don't want the delivery here.
I want it in Sunder Nagar.

727
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:15,930
Sunder Nagar? And the money?

728
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:18,010
You'll get it.

729
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:20,690
As soon as I get the explosives,
I will pay you.

730
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,178
Simran, hurry up.
We are getting late. - Coming.

731
01:00:24,503 --> 01:00:25,925
Soni.
- They must be waiting!

732
01:00:26,005 --> 01:00:27,210
Yes, Mom!

733
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,260
I told you to dry these clothes
on the roof before taking a bath.

734
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,659
Mom, you do it.

735
01:00:31,739 --> 01:00:34,100
We are going to fix the wedding date.

736
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:36,260
When will you grow up? Come.

737
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,940
Beena. Dry these clothes too.

738
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,380
Okay, ma'am.

739
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,060
You?

740
01:00:42,503 --> 01:00:44,500
What are you doing on the roof?

741
01:00:47,465 --> 01:00:51,140
This?
- It's nothing.

742
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:55,420
Simran, are you coming or
should I go by myself? - Coming.

743
01:00:55,983 --> 01:00:58,420
We'll return soon.
- Come on. We're getting late.

744
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,140
Take care.
- Yes, Mom.

745
01:01:06,231 --> 01:01:09,128
Now what are you thinking? Come on.

746
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:11,380
I'm coming.
- Get in.

747
01:01:13,334 --> 01:01:14,820
Okay.

748
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,980
Chhotu? - Yes.
- Where is Badal?

749
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,620
I don't know.
He has not come since morning.

750
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,580
I'm doomed. I'm very troubled.

751
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:27,460
Mister, I'll solve your problem.
Where is your car?

752
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:30,420
My car? I missed my car, brother.

753
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,140
Missed it? - Yes, I just got married.
I'm new to this city.

754
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,540
We are here on our honeymoon.

755
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:38,820
God knows where my wife has gone.
I'm very worried.

756
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,980
Listen, if your wife is lost,
why have you come to my garage?

757
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,340
My wife is very innocent.

758
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:46,420
Someone must've given her
a lift and she must've gone with him.

759
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,900
The car could possibly break down.

760
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:49,380
He might come here to get it fixed.

761
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:51,300
So I came here. I am worried.

762
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:54,380
If your car has broken down,
I'll repair it. - Okay.

763
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,540
But what do I do about your wife?

764
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,980
What's the difference
between a car and a wife?

765
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:02,500
A car breaks down suddenly
and so does the wife.

766
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:05,780
Tell me. What part is damaged?
- All the parts.

767
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,020
What are you talking about?

768
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,500
I'm newly married.
And you are talking about parts.

769
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,540
Are you crazy? I am worried.

770
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,220
And to make matters worse,
you're making me mad!

771
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:16,660
If your wife is lost, go to the
police station and lodge a complaint.

772
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:19,500
They ask so many questions
at the police station.

773
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:22,460
Are you married or not?
Where? And how?

774
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,660
Who does your wife look like?
Is she fair or dark? - Mister.

775
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,140
How does she sit? How does she walk?

776
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,540
They ask countless questions.
And I have only one mind.

777
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:32,144
You just tell me how can I help you.

778
01:02:32,224 --> 01:02:34,740
Write down the address. - Tell me.

779
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:39,248
India's most wanted, Delhi..
- My dear! - Billo's voice!

780
01:02:39,328 --> 01:02:41,340
You are here?
- Billo, where are you?

781
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:43,100
I searched everywhere for you..

782
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:45,340
..the Zoo, the police station.

783
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,420
Police station?
- Then what?

784
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,660
You should've got lost
after our wedding night.

785
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:55,900
I got lost for the first time.
Sorry for the trouble.

786
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,380
I was confused.
- Hold this.

787
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:01,004
What day is today?
- Sunday.

788
01:03:01,084 --> 01:03:03,340
I think there will be a
world war in the hotel. - Come.

789
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,340
Bye.

790
01:03:05,075 --> 01:03:07,555
Today, I'm very delighted, Simran.

791
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:11,075
Our daughter's wedding date is fixed.

792
01:03:11,475 --> 01:03:17,915
But we'll cry a lot when
our Soni goes to her in-laws.

793
01:03:18,555 --> 01:03:22,155
Right, Simran? What happened?

794
01:03:22,315 --> 01:03:25,195
Are you fine?
- I'm very afraid.

795
01:03:25,275 --> 01:03:27,515
Afraid? Why?

796
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:33,075
That guy in our house.
- Yes.

797
01:03:33,475 --> 01:03:36,595
He might do something
to our daughters.

798
01:03:36,755 --> 01:03:39,315
You are unnecessarily
getting worried, Simran.

799
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,795
Badal is one of our own.

800
01:03:41,995 --> 01:03:45,355
He is Daya Shankar's relative.
He must be at the shop.

801
01:03:46,235 --> 01:03:48,955
Hello, sister-in-law. Hello, sir.

802
01:03:49,035 --> 01:03:50,875
Daya Shankar, where is Badal?
- I don't know.

803
01:03:51,075 --> 01:03:53,595
He didn't show up
for work this morning.

804
01:03:53,715 --> 01:03:56,155
Come on. Let's go home quickly.

805
01:03:57,715 --> 01:03:59,035
Okay.

806
01:04:06,915 --> 01:04:08,995
Preeti. Soni.

807
01:04:09,395 --> 01:04:11,115
What happened?
- Soni.

808
01:04:11,315 --> 01:04:12,995
Mom! - Preeti.
- Simran, what happened?

809
01:04:13,075 --> 01:04:16,115
Mom.
- My child. - Preeti!

810
01:04:17,995 --> 01:04:20,115
Soni! So..

811
01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:23,515
Where is my daughter?
What did you do to her?

812
01:04:24,195 --> 01:04:26,915
Where is my Soni?
- Mom. What happened, Mom?

813
01:04:26,995 --> 01:04:29,155
Why are you beating him? Mom.

814
01:04:29,235 --> 01:04:30,555
What's going on, Simran?

815
01:04:31,235 --> 01:04:33,315
Papa, my plan is ruined.

816
01:04:33,395 --> 01:04:34,875
Today is your wedding anniversary.

817
01:04:34,955 --> 01:04:37,035
Badal was decorating
the whole house for the party.

818
01:04:37,115 --> 01:04:40,075
What is this blood?
- Mom, this is the paint.

819
01:04:40,267 --> 01:04:41,875
I was making the wedding
anniversary board.

820
01:04:41,955 --> 01:04:44,035
She was being naughty.
Her shirt got stained in the process.

821
01:04:44,115 --> 01:04:45,915
And that gun shot?

822
01:04:45,995 --> 01:04:48,675
I was watching a movie on T.V., Mom.

823
01:04:48,894 --> 01:04:51,115
And why did you beat Badal?

824
01:05:08,387 --> 01:05:12,995
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

825
01:05:16,075 --> 01:05:18,075
I am not your mother..

826
01:05:19,075 --> 01:05:21,155
..but I am like your mother.

827
01:05:22,235 --> 01:05:24,675
Even a mother can make a mistake,
can't she?

828
01:05:26,035 --> 01:05:28,075
Forgive me, son.

829
01:05:32,155 --> 01:05:36,795
Son, you have decorated
the house with lights.

830
01:05:37,274 --> 01:05:39,395
Will you not show them to my wife?

831
01:06:08,795 --> 01:06:18,315
"The beauty of my
beloved is so radiant."

832
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:28,115
"This moon looks like your face."

833
01:06:38,475 --> 01:06:40,515
"I have lost my sleep and peace."

834
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:42,635
"A craving aroused, a pain awakened."

835
01:06:42,755 --> 01:06:45,915
"The matter proceeded. Who knows?"

836
01:06:45,995 --> 01:06:47,955
"When love happened."

837
01:06:48,035 --> 01:06:52,035
"When love happened."

838
01:06:55,275 --> 01:06:59,395
"Through my eyes,
you entered my heart."

839
01:06:59,475 --> 01:07:03,995
"Through my eyes,
you entered my heart."

840
01:07:04,075 --> 01:07:07,475
"It took away your life."

841
01:07:07,555 --> 01:07:09,275
"Beloved, beloved."

842
01:07:09,475 --> 01:07:12,435
"Beloved, beloved."

843
01:07:12,515 --> 01:07:16,275
"Beloved, beloved."

844
01:07:16,515 --> 01:07:20,635
"Beloved, beloved."

845
01:07:20,755 --> 01:07:24,235
"Beloved, beloved."

846
01:07:25,075 --> 01:07:29,155
"Through my eyes,
you entered my heart."

847
01:07:29,235 --> 01:07:33,555
"Through my eyes,
you entered my heart."

848
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:37,435
"It took away your life."

849
01:07:37,635 --> 01:07:41,715
"Beloved, beloved."

850
01:07:41,835 --> 01:07:45,795
"Beloved, beloved."

851
01:07:46,115 --> 01:07:49,635
"Beloved, beloved."

852
01:07:50,235 --> 01:07:54,195
"Beloved, beloved."

853
01:08:11,395 --> 01:08:14,955
"Beloved, beloved."

854
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:19,315
"Beloved, beloved."

855
01:08:19,955 --> 01:08:24,075
"The one with bindi,
bangles, braids, rosy cheeks.."

856
01:08:24,155 --> 01:08:28,195
"..and dark eyes,
stole my heart away."

857
01:08:28,275 --> 01:08:32,315
"The one wearing the
blue and yellow silky veil.."

858
01:08:32,395 --> 01:08:36,715
"..who sweet talked, stole my heart."

859
01:08:38,275 --> 01:08:40,195
"Those who taste you.."

860
01:08:40,275 --> 01:08:44,035
..they will be as intoxicated.."

861
01:08:44,115 --> 01:08:47,875
..as the inside of
a closed bottle of liquor."

862
01:08:48,679 --> 01:08:50,755
"On your face.."

863
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:54,275
"Looking at the two
black moles on your face.."

864
01:08:54,355 --> 01:08:58,675
"..consumes me with intoxication."

865
01:09:02,435 --> 01:09:06,675
"My beloved, let us meet."

866
01:09:06,755 --> 01:09:10,875
"Even if we have to do this
surreptitiously, let's talk."

867
01:09:10,955 --> 01:09:15,115
"Beloved, let us meet."

868
01:09:15,195 --> 01:09:19,995
"Even if we have to do this
surreptitiously, let's talk."

869
01:09:21,195 --> 01:09:25,235
"Like a lamp on dark nights."

870
01:09:25,315 --> 01:09:29,915
"Like a lamp on dark nights."

871
01:09:29,995 --> 01:09:33,675
"Is his smile."

872
01:09:33,755 --> 01:09:36,875
"Beloved, beloved."

873
01:09:37,675 --> 01:09:42,235
"Beloved, beloved."

874
01:09:42,315 --> 01:09:46,395
"Beloved, beloved."

875
01:09:46,475 --> 01:09:51,115
"Beloved, beloved."

876
01:10:11,641 --> 01:10:15,273
"Beloved, beloved."

877
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:19,475
"Beloved, beloved."

878
01:10:20,155 --> 01:10:22,275
"I am crazy, so are you."

879
01:10:22,355 --> 01:10:24,275
"I am fanatical, and so are you."

880
01:10:24,355 --> 01:10:28,484
"Queen of my dreams,
what craftsmanship."

881
01:10:28,564 --> 01:10:30,506
"You saw it? I saw it too."

882
01:10:30,586 --> 01:10:32,690
"You thought about it, so did I."

883
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:37,195
"You said. I said. You are gorgeous."

884
01:10:38,539 --> 01:10:44,355
"I've lost you. You're handsome."

885
01:10:44,435 --> 01:10:48,315
"This youth is so treacherous."

886
01:10:49,075 --> 01:10:51,155
"Look at this."

887
01:10:51,235 --> 01:10:59,595
"This youth is so treacherous."

888
01:11:02,715 --> 01:11:06,915
"I find solace even in fever."

889
01:11:06,995 --> 01:11:10,961
"If you smile,
the season of spring will arrive."

890
01:11:11,041 --> 01:11:15,177
"I find solace even in fever."

891
01:11:15,257 --> 01:11:20,139
"If you smile,
the season of spring will arrive."

892
01:11:21,307 --> 01:11:25,555
"Your style and your grace.."

893
01:11:25,635 --> 01:11:29,995
"Your style and your grace.."

894
01:11:30,075 --> 01:11:33,395
"..has floored me."

895
01:11:33,475 --> 01:11:38,035
"Beloved, beloved."

896
01:11:38,115 --> 01:11:42,315
"Beloved, beloved."

897
01:11:42,395 --> 01:11:46,355
"Beloved, beloved."

898
01:11:46,626 --> 01:11:51,555
"Beloved, beloved."

899
01:11:54,688 --> 01:11:58,808
"Through my eyes,
you entered my heart."

900
01:11:58,888 --> 01:12:03,128
"Through my eyes,
you entered my heart."

901
01:12:03,208 --> 01:12:07,248
"It took away your life."

902
01:12:07,426 --> 01:12:10,128
"My great brother."

903
01:12:16,528 --> 01:12:19,848
"Beloved, beloved."

904
01:12:19,928 --> 01:12:30,088
"The beauty of my
beloved is so radiant."

905
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:40,768
"This moon looks like your face."

906
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:49,168
I've been waiting since long.
Why hasn't Badal come?

907
01:12:50,488 --> 01:12:54,568
"In this breeze. In these mountains."

908
01:12:54,688 --> 01:12:58,208
"Your beloved calls you."

909
01:12:58,888 --> 01:13:02,648
Oh, God. It is such
a beautiful love point.

910
01:13:02,768 --> 01:13:07,288
This is the point where
Laila and Majnu.. - Oh, God.

911
01:13:07,598 --> 01:13:10,768
..Heer and Ranjah..
- Oh, God.

912
01:13:10,848 --> 01:13:13,648
..Juliet and Romeo..
- Oh, gosh!

913
01:13:13,768 --> 01:13:18,208
..and Titanic's heroine and hero..
- Darling.

914
01:13:18,328 --> 01:13:20,128
..committed suicide.
- What?

915
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:23,848
They committed suicide.
- What's suicide?

916
01:13:24,168 --> 01:13:28,408
People who are not happy
with themselves commit suicide.

917
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:30,488
Really? Suicide?

918
01:13:30,568 --> 01:13:34,608
Some people die in their sleep,
and others don't..

919
01:13:34,728 --> 01:13:36,488
..they are called suicide.

920
01:13:36,568 --> 01:13:38,248
This is my philosophy.

921
01:13:38,368 --> 01:13:41,448
I think you have gone crazy, Guler!

922
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:43,288
I've gone crazy?

923
01:13:43,368 --> 01:13:44,928
Congratulations!

924
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,208
I've heard everybody goes
mad after they get married.

925
01:13:47,328 --> 01:13:49,248
What's the big deal if
I've gone crazy? - Excuse me.

926
01:13:49,368 --> 01:13:51,128
Billo. - Excuse me, Mister.
What's the time?

927
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:54,528
I hope you are not fooling me.
- Mr., excuse me. What's the time?

928
01:13:54,648 --> 01:13:58,248
What's the point?
What's the point of asking the time?

929
01:13:58,328 --> 01:14:00,528
Today you will ask for the time.
I'll tell you the time.

930
01:14:00,648 --> 01:14:03,048
After a while, you'll ask for my name.
I'll give you my name.

931
01:14:03,128 --> 01:14:05,168
Then you'll ask for my address.
I'll give it to you.

932
01:14:05,248 --> 01:14:07,608
I'll ask for your address.
You'll give it to me.

933
01:14:07,688 --> 01:14:10,208
I'll come to your place.
You'll come to my place.

934
01:14:10,288 --> 01:14:12,528
We'll do this often.
Friendship will blossom.

935
01:14:12,608 --> 01:14:15,648
You will come to my house.
My wife will become suspicious.

936
01:14:15,768 --> 01:14:17,648
What's the point?
- But I just want to know the time.

937
01:14:17,768 --> 01:14:22,008
I am coming to that.
Look, we can't be sure about the time.

938
01:14:22,088 --> 01:14:24,848
In these times,
friends are not friends anymore..

939
01:14:24,928 --> 01:14:26,248
..enemies are not enemies.

940
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:29,568
They humiliate us. The times are bad.

941
01:14:29,648 --> 01:14:31,488
Everywhere there are time bombs.

942
01:14:31,568 --> 01:14:33,888
Could we imagine that
the times would be like this?

943
01:14:34,008 --> 01:14:36,608
I'm worried. Please tell me the time.

944
01:14:36,688 --> 01:14:37,848
Look, I will tell you.

945
01:14:37,968 --> 01:14:40,248
I'll tell you what time it will
be tomorrow and what time it is today.

946
01:14:40,328 --> 01:14:43,328
I'll tell you about the future.
The times ahead are very bad.

947
01:14:43,408 --> 01:14:47,448
I'm sorry for you.
This is not a good time for you.

948
01:14:47,528 --> 01:14:50,488
You're asking me for the time.
Who doesn't have time?

949
01:14:50,568 --> 01:14:53,448
I never wear a watch.
What's the point?

950
01:14:53,528 --> 01:14:56,488
If we can't take it with us,
it doesn't make sense to wear one.

951
01:14:56,568 --> 01:14:59,248
This is my philosophy.

952
01:14:59,448 --> 01:15:01,888
Everybody runs away after
listening to my philosophy.

953
01:15:07,888 --> 01:15:09,608
I was waiting over
there like a crazy person.

954
01:15:09,688 --> 01:15:11,528
And you're waiting
comfortably in the car.

955
01:15:11,808 --> 01:15:14,448
I'm not lying. I'm doing my work.

956
01:15:14,528 --> 01:15:17,168
But you had promised to meet me.

957
01:15:17,288 --> 01:15:19,328
You probably dreamt it.

958
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:22,283
Does that mean you
didn't call me last night?

959
01:15:22,483 --> 01:15:24,243
You didn't promise to meet me?

960
01:15:24,483 --> 01:15:27,643
No. Now go home and let me do my work.

961
01:15:27,883 --> 01:15:29,123
That's what I'm here for. Work.

962
01:15:29,323 --> 01:15:31,123
My car has broken down. Repair it.

963
01:15:31,363 --> 01:15:33,603
What's wrong with your car?
- I don't know.

964
01:15:33,763 --> 01:15:35,163
I'm not a mechanic.

965
01:15:35,243 --> 01:15:36,243
Come with me for a drive.

966
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:37,803
You'll find out what's
wrong with the car.

967
01:15:37,883 --> 01:15:41,843
Look, I don't have
time for your nonsense.

968
01:15:42,107 --> 01:15:45,723
When your car really breaks down,
come to me.

969
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,683
Talking big.

970
01:15:50,803 --> 01:15:52,923
Hey.
- Yes.

971
01:15:53,003 --> 01:15:54,523
Come here.

972
01:15:55,068 --> 01:15:56,083
Tell me, ma'am.

973
01:15:56,163 --> 01:15:59,163
The brake,
fuel pump, gearbox and carburetor..

974
01:15:59,243 --> 01:16:00,523
Repair it?

975
01:16:00,603 --> 01:16:04,043
No. Damage it!
- What?

976
01:16:04,549 --> 01:16:06,083
Use your strength.
- Come on.

977
01:16:06,163 --> 01:16:07,203
Use your strength.
- Come on.

978
01:16:07,323 --> 01:16:09,923
Use your strength.
- Come on.

979
01:16:10,376 --> 01:16:12,123
Thanks.
- Hey?

980
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,683
Hey, come here.

981
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:19,041
My car broke down. Repair it.

982
01:16:19,201 --> 01:16:21,481
Look, I don't have the time.

983
01:16:21,681 --> 01:16:23,921
Get it repaired from
somewhere else. - No.

984
01:16:24,281 --> 01:16:26,441
I want to get it repaired by you.

985
01:16:26,641 --> 01:16:28,721
Don't be stubborn.

986
01:16:29,281 --> 01:16:30,921
You're being stubborn.

987
01:16:31,361 --> 01:16:33,441
You're being stubborn.
- You're being stubborn.

988
01:16:33,561 --> 01:16:35,721
You're being stubborn.
- You're being stubborn.

989
01:16:35,961 --> 01:16:37,041
It's you..
- Badal.

990
01:16:37,241 --> 01:16:38,561
Uncle.

991
01:16:38,721 --> 01:16:41,721
What is it? Why are you fighting?

992
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:44,481
Look, uncle. My car has broken down.

993
01:16:44,561 --> 01:16:47,441
I've been telling him to repair it.
But he doesn't listen.

994
01:16:47,521 --> 01:16:50,281
Her car has broken down. Repair it.

995
01:16:51,201 --> 01:16:53,441
She is Kedarnath's grandchild.

996
01:16:53,721 --> 01:16:56,201
You have to repair this car.

997
01:16:57,201 --> 01:16:59,121
Badal, where is Daya Shankar?

998
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,361
Where is he?
- He has gone home.

999
01:17:01,441 --> 01:17:03,081
Here he comes.

1000
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:05,561
Daya Shankar, where are you going?

1001
01:17:05,641 --> 01:17:08,401
My aunt is very sick.
- Really?

1002
01:17:08,481 --> 01:17:10,361
Yes. I received a telegram
to go there immediately.

1003
01:17:10,441 --> 01:17:12,121
God knows what will happen.

1004
01:17:12,201 --> 01:17:16,641
You know my aunt raised
me after my mother's death.

1005
01:17:16,721 --> 01:17:19,561
Have faith in God.
Everything will be fine.

1006
01:17:20,128 --> 01:17:23,321
Come. I'll drop you
to the bus stop. Come on.

1007
01:17:23,401 --> 01:17:24,521
Badal, I am leaving.

1008
01:17:24,601 --> 01:17:26,074
You're responsible
for the shop in my absence.

1009
01:17:26,154 --> 01:17:28,561
Don't worry.
- God knows when I will return.

1010
01:17:28,681 --> 01:17:31,241
Many rituals have to
be performed after her death.

1011
01:17:31,321 --> 01:17:34,441
Why are you being negative? Come on.

1012
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:36,361
Look after the shop.

1013
01:17:36,441 --> 01:17:39,441
Badal, take Rani's car for a test run.

1014
01:17:39,718 --> 01:17:42,241
You can repair the
car later if you want.

1015
01:17:42,401 --> 01:17:46,247
We'll take some other
car for a test run right now.

1016
01:17:55,521 --> 01:17:59,121
I know you love me.
Why don't you say it?

1017
01:17:59,201 --> 01:18:00,721
Look ahead and drive..

1018
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:04,281
..or else there will be an accident.
- Who is afraid of accidents?

1019
01:18:04,841 --> 01:18:07,401
I will die in your arms.

1020
01:18:07,481 --> 01:18:09,401
Now say you love me.

1021
01:18:09,921 --> 01:18:11,521
Say that you love me.

1022
01:18:12,443 --> 01:18:14,641
Say that you love me.

1023
01:18:18,241 --> 01:18:20,161
You won't?

1024
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:23,401
You don't know me.
I will risk my life.

1025
01:18:56,790 --> 01:19:00,281
Don't play with fire. You will burn.

1026
01:19:00,881 --> 01:19:04,281
So be it! I want to burn.

1027
01:19:06,601 --> 01:19:09,601
Are you crazy?
- Cray in love with you.

1028
01:19:10,161 --> 01:19:14,521
My heart is made of stone.

1029
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:17,354
Badal, I have seen
stone-hearted people mellow out.

1030
01:19:17,434 --> 01:19:21,408
You'll be shattered!
- I don't mind.

1031
01:19:21,592 --> 01:19:24,641
Why are you endangering your life?

1032
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:28,721
My life is connected
with your life, Badal.

1033
01:19:29,159 --> 01:19:32,841
If I don't have you,
then what will I do with this life?

1034
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,361
I will die.

1035
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:36,601
I will die.

1036
01:19:54,705 --> 01:19:57,801
Rani.

1037
01:20:01,113 --> 01:20:03,433
I love you.

1038
01:20:03,513 --> 01:20:07,073
"Beloved."

1039
01:20:07,473 --> 01:20:13,513
"My darling."

1040
01:20:45,953 --> 01:20:48,633
"Beloved."

1041
01:20:49,633 --> 01:20:54,273
"My darling."

1042
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:59,873
"My companion, my beloved."

1043
01:20:59,953 --> 01:21:03,233
"You stole my heart, my beloved."

1044
01:21:03,433 --> 01:21:06,873
"My companion, my beloved."

1045
01:21:06,993 --> 01:21:10,153
"You stole my heart, my beloved."

1046
01:21:10,233 --> 01:21:11,953
"I don't want to live without you."

1047
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:13,913
"I don't want to die without you."

1048
01:21:13,993 --> 01:21:17,153
"I swear to God."

1049
01:21:17,233 --> 01:21:20,353
"My companion, my beloved."

1050
01:21:20,993 --> 01:21:24,273
"You stole my heart, my beloved."

1051
01:21:24,353 --> 01:21:27,833
"My companion, my beloved."

1052
01:21:27,953 --> 01:21:31,113
"You stole my heart, my beloved."

1053
01:21:31,193 --> 01:21:32,953
"I don't want to live without you."

1054
01:21:33,033 --> 01:21:34,953
"I don't want to die without you."

1055
01:21:35,033 --> 01:21:38,113
"I swear to God."

1056
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:41,633
"My companion, my beloved."

1057
01:21:41,913 --> 01:21:45,393
"You stole my heart, my beloved."

1058
01:22:19,793 --> 01:22:23,193
"You and I."

1059
01:22:23,273 --> 01:22:27,313
"Wonderful ambiance, my darling."

1060
01:22:27,393 --> 01:22:32,553
"The pain this love has given us."

1061
01:22:34,153 --> 01:22:39,433
"This love has made us mad."

1062
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:46,993
"Stop me. I'm going crazy."

1063
01:22:48,233 --> 01:22:53,753
"The weather's intoxicated.
The clouds have gone wild."

1064
01:22:55,113 --> 01:22:56,753
"I don't want to live without you."

1065
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:58,673
"I don't want to die without you."

1066
01:22:58,753 --> 01:23:01,873
"I swear to God."

1067
01:23:02,153 --> 01:23:05,673
"My companion, my beloved."

1068
01:23:05,753 --> 01:23:09,233
"You stole my heart, my beloved."

1069
01:23:09,313 --> 01:23:12,473
"My companion, my beloved."

1070
01:23:12,553 --> 01:23:16,433
"You stole my heart, my beloved."

1071
01:23:54,153 --> 01:23:57,633
"My love.."

1072
01:23:57,713 --> 01:24:01,473
"..is my life."

1073
01:24:01,713 --> 01:24:06,793
"Why do you love me so much?"

1074
01:24:08,513 --> 01:24:14,033
"I know even you love me immensely."

1075
01:24:15,473 --> 01:24:21,113
"I don't know where I am
and what is going on in the world."

1076
01:24:22,633 --> 01:24:28,233
"It's the effect of my love."

1077
01:24:29,513 --> 01:24:31,233
"I don't want to live without you."

1078
01:24:31,313 --> 01:24:33,067
"I don't want to die without you."

1079
01:24:33,147 --> 01:24:36,311
"I swear to God."

1080
01:24:36,484 --> 01:24:39,873
"My companion, my beloved."

1081
01:24:40,073 --> 01:24:43,433
"You stole my heart, my beloved."

1082
01:24:43,513 --> 01:24:46,993
"My companion, my beloved."

1083
01:24:47,153 --> 01:24:50,673
"You stole my heart, my beloved."

1084
01:25:10,433 --> 01:25:12,633
Excuse me.
- Yes.

1085
01:25:14,105 --> 01:25:15,873
Where is the temple of Goddess Tara?

1086
01:25:16,234 --> 01:25:19,433
On that hill.
- Hail Mother Goddess!

1087
01:25:35,802 --> 01:25:37,113
The explosives have arrived.

1088
01:25:37,233 --> 01:25:39,913
Rana's death is that
much away from him..

1089
01:25:40,193 --> 01:25:42,273
..as much I am away from him.

1090
01:25:44,233 --> 01:25:45,873
No, dear.

1091
01:25:46,473 --> 01:25:51,433
A decision made in
haste ruins everything.

1092
01:25:52,623 --> 01:25:56,713
Don't forget, this is our last chance.

1093
01:25:57,196 --> 01:26:01,153
Hail Mother Goddess!

1094
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:04,433
Hotel Bawa. Room number 102.
Come there with the money.

1095
01:26:19,011 --> 01:26:20,913
Preeti, did you call dad?

1096
01:26:20,993 --> 01:26:24,033
Yes, Mom. But the constable
said dad has gone out.

1097
01:26:24,113 --> 01:26:26,433
He doesn't care about anything
except for his duty. - Badal.

1098
01:26:26,513 --> 01:26:28,753
Badal, where are you going?
- I have some urgent work.

1099
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:31,114
Look how beautiful sister looks.
The groom's family has arrived.

1100
01:26:31,194 --> 01:26:32,393
Preeti, I have to go.

1101
01:26:32,473 --> 01:26:34,553
Can anything be more
important than sisters?

1102
01:26:34,633 --> 01:26:37,913
No, Badal. Come on. Come, Badal!

1103
01:26:39,615 --> 01:26:42,833
Who is this guy?
- He is my brother.

1104
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:46,146
In the absence of the father,
the brother may perform this ritual.

1105
01:26:46,805 --> 01:26:48,393
Come, Badal. Come on.

1106
01:27:10,193 --> 01:27:12,713
"Sing, Tara, ra, ra."

1107
01:27:13,875 --> 01:27:14,953
Excuse me.
- Yes.

1108
01:27:15,033 --> 01:27:16,513
Did you see her?
- Who?

1109
01:27:16,593 --> 01:27:17,753
My wife?

1110
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:20,313
I'm a married man.
Why would I look at your wife?

1111
01:27:20,433 --> 01:27:22,553
I mean, my wife is not in her room.

1112
01:27:22,633 --> 01:27:25,433
Then she must be in some other room.
- What do you mean?

1113
01:27:25,766 --> 01:27:27,713
You're misunderstanding me.

1114
01:27:27,961 --> 01:27:30,433
She must be sitting in the
neighbouring room, passing time.

1115
01:27:30,513 --> 01:27:33,313
In the neighbouring room,
passing time! Am I dead?

1116
01:27:33,393 --> 01:27:35,713
She must be sitting with some woman.

1117
01:27:36,859 --> 01:27:38,606
Must be sitting with some woman.

1118
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:41,793
Fine. When you find her,
send her to my address.

1119
01:27:41,873 --> 01:27:43,753
Fine? - Fine.
- "Sing, tara ra ra."

1120
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:45,793
The room is over here. Here.
- Where? There?

1121
01:27:45,873 --> 01:27:47,633
Here?
- "Sing, tara ra ra."

1122
01:27:47,907 --> 01:27:50,553
Hello.
- Yes.

1123
01:27:50,923 --> 01:27:53,593
Is your wife in the room?
- Yes. Why?

1124
01:27:53,673 --> 01:27:55,553
Who is he?
- My wife must not be here in that case.

1125
01:27:55,766 --> 01:27:57,273
He is a weird character.

1126
01:27:57,626 --> 01:28:01,433
Only women have character.
Men have tractors!

1127
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:04,353
"Oh, God!"

1128
01:28:04,556 --> 01:28:10,913
"My beloved cries out to the Lord.
My Billo is a gorgeous woman."

1129
01:28:12,473 --> 01:28:16,593
"Beautiful. My wife is beautiful."

1130
01:28:16,673 --> 01:28:20,593
"Nobody else. But me."

1131
01:28:21,064 --> 01:28:23,033
Darling!

1132
01:28:23,313 --> 01:28:26,593
You just brag about it.
You don't really celebrate the honeymoon.

1133
01:28:26,673 --> 01:28:28,153
Don't insult me.

1134
01:28:28,273 --> 01:28:31,193
Today, I will do what
nobody else has done.

1135
01:28:31,273 --> 01:28:32,673
With a splash of perfume.

1136
01:28:32,753 --> 01:28:36,833
Perfume. Where is the perfume?

1137
01:28:37,353 --> 01:28:38,353
Darling?

1138
01:28:38,859 --> 01:28:40,553
Yes, I am here.

1139
01:28:42,633 --> 01:28:45,073
Darling, that perfume smells terrible.

1140
01:28:45,193 --> 01:28:47,673
It is so fragrant.
- You must have a cold.

1141
01:28:47,753 --> 01:28:50,153
Sniff it.

1142
01:28:50,513 --> 01:28:51,553
It's fine.

1143
01:28:51,633 --> 01:28:53,833
You put it on. I don't want it.

1144
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:56,073
Did your father ever use perfume?

1145
01:28:56,553 --> 01:28:57,553
Don't bring my father's
name into this.

1146
01:28:57,673 --> 01:28:58,553
Did your mother ever put some on?

1147
01:28:58,633 --> 01:29:00,193
Don't bring my mother's
name into this.

1148
01:29:00,273 --> 01:29:01,713
Then whose name should I bring up?

1149
01:29:01,908 --> 01:29:03,833
You mentioned my mother's name.

1150
01:29:03,913 --> 01:29:06,673
You mentioned my father's name.
- What should I do?

1151
01:29:06,753 --> 01:29:10,153
I will not spare you. - No.

1152
01:29:10,233 --> 01:29:14,233
Will you bring my parents into this?
- No, enough.

1153
01:29:14,313 --> 01:29:17,473
I won't spare you.
Our marriage is over!

1154
01:29:17,553 --> 01:29:20,313
What did you say?

1155
01:29:26,513 --> 01:29:27,793
Why are you barking like a dog?

1156
01:29:27,971 --> 01:29:29,833
You have harassed me.

1157
01:29:30,036 --> 01:29:31,433
Who is harassing you?

1158
01:29:31,593 --> 01:29:32,993
You came in without knocking.

1159
01:29:33,193 --> 01:29:34,753
Should I be worried or should you?

1160
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:37,633
Take this. - She is beating
me like you would beat a dog.

1161
01:29:37,713 --> 01:29:38,993
Who is worried?

1162
01:29:39,113 --> 01:29:42,273
We've been married for seven years,
but we don't have a child.

1163
01:29:42,353 --> 01:29:44,193
Who should be worried, you or I?

1164
01:29:44,273 --> 01:29:46,193
We've been on seven honeymoons.

1165
01:29:46,273 --> 01:29:47,833
But it is futile.

1166
01:29:47,913 --> 01:29:48,993
Who is more worried?

1167
01:29:49,113 --> 01:29:51,353
One time she went to
the roof to dry pickle..

1168
01:29:51,433 --> 01:29:53,313
..and my mother was
cutting cucumber below.

1169
01:29:53,393 --> 01:29:55,993
She slipped. Nothing happened to her..

1170
01:29:56,073 --> 01:29:57,513
..but my mother died.

1171
01:29:57,593 --> 01:29:59,673
My father remarried
in his state of shock.

1172
01:29:59,753 --> 01:30:01,233
He had four children.

1173
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:02,833
But I have no idea when
I'll have any children.

1174
01:30:02,913 --> 01:30:04,473
Who should be worried?

1175
01:30:04,593 --> 01:30:07,113
Come. I will trouble you. - Leave him.

1176
01:30:10,873 --> 01:30:14,553
What has happened to your eye?
- Switch on the light!

1177
01:30:14,633 --> 01:30:16,913
What should I do?
- Switch on the light.

1178
01:30:16,993 --> 01:30:19,073
It's turned on.
- What happened to me?

1179
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:22,393
He beat you up?
- He thrashed me.

1180
01:30:22,473 --> 01:30:23,633
Yes. He thrashed me.

1181
01:30:23,713 --> 01:30:26,073
Call the police.
- He thrashed me.

1182
01:30:26,233 --> 01:30:27,993
Call the fire brigade.

1183
01:30:28,073 --> 01:30:30,593
You locked horns with Guler Rangoli.

1184
01:30:30,673 --> 01:30:32,553
Hello, Gazi Nagar police station.

1185
01:30:34,873 --> 01:30:35,753
Police.

1186
01:30:36,673 --> 01:30:38,593
Hello.
- What is the fight about?

1187
01:30:38,673 --> 01:30:39,993
Upstairs!
- Catch him.

1188
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:45,593
Mister, have you come on
a honeymoon or to cause riots?

1189
01:30:45,673 --> 01:30:50,993
Oh, God. He thrashed my husband!
And you're accusing him of rioting!

1190
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:53,713
Let me make one thing clear, sir.

1191
01:30:53,873 --> 01:30:57,833
The riot you are talking
about happened in 1984.

1192
01:30:57,913 --> 01:31:01,246
Now it will be a lot worse.
Get me the sword. Get..

1193
01:31:01,326 --> 01:31:03,633
How many times have I told
you to carry a sword? - Okay. Okay.

1194
01:31:03,713 --> 01:31:06,153
But you never listen!

1195
01:31:06,233 --> 01:31:07,433
Keep quiet.

1196
01:31:07,513 --> 01:31:10,313
Don't act too smart.
You're crying for nothing.

1197
01:31:10,433 --> 01:31:12,793
Keep quiet. Listen to me.

1198
01:31:13,182 --> 01:31:15,833
Who had a fight with the sardar?

1199
01:31:15,913 --> 01:31:19,913
Sir, they were making a lot of noise.

1200
01:31:20,145 --> 01:31:22,953
He went to stop them.
Sardar started the fight.

1201
01:31:23,033 --> 01:31:25,366
We'll quarrel or create a ruckus.

1202
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:26,609
Who are you to stop us?

1203
01:31:26,769 --> 01:31:28,569
You punched me. Am I a punching bag?

1204
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:30,889
You scoundrel.
- Keep quiet.

1205
01:31:31,009 --> 01:31:33,489
Go out! - Okay, all right.
Let's go. - Come on.

1206
01:31:34,144 --> 01:31:37,009
Where have you come from?
- We've come from Ludhiana.

1207
01:31:37,089 --> 01:31:38,449
What's your business?

1208
01:31:38,529 --> 01:31:41,849
We're into woolen clothes.
We're traders.

1209
01:31:43,571 --> 01:31:45,569
What's in this bag?

1210
01:31:46,468 --> 01:31:49,247
Shawls and sweaters.

1211
01:31:58,529 --> 01:32:00,769
Oh, God.

1212
01:32:01,369 --> 01:32:03,729
You hit him.
- Stop.

1213
01:32:26,275 --> 01:32:27,583
Stop.

1214
01:32:58,329 --> 01:33:00,769
He ran away in fright.

1215
01:33:04,129 --> 01:33:04,889
Rascal.

1216
01:33:04,969 --> 01:33:08,889
He is running away.
Nab him. - Thief! - Nab him!

1217
01:33:10,169 --> 01:33:11,129
It is good that they were killed.

1218
01:33:11,209 --> 01:33:12,526
Yes.
- I think he's a terrorist.

1219
01:33:12,606 --> 01:33:14,039
They were terrorists.
That's why they were killed.

1220
01:33:14,119 --> 01:33:15,228
Have you ever heard of this?

1221
01:33:15,415 --> 01:33:16,415
I've never heard of this.

1222
01:33:16,535 --> 01:33:18,455
I've been staying here since a long
time. But this has never happened.

1223
01:33:18,615 --> 01:33:22,495
Am I right?
- Look! They are taking that man away.

1224
01:33:42,034 --> 01:33:44,594
Soni, just call up the
police station and find out..

1225
01:33:44,794 --> 01:33:45,714
..why your dad hasn't returned yet?

1226
01:33:45,794 --> 01:33:48,473
Right away, Mom.
- Don't worry. I'll make the call.

1227
01:33:48,714 --> 01:33:51,154
If you dial, it will connect
to your brother-in-law's house.

1228
01:33:51,234 --> 01:33:53,034
Very funny, Preeti.

1229
01:33:53,154 --> 01:33:55,594
Hello.
- Gandhi Chawk police station.

1230
01:33:55,674 --> 01:33:57,594
I'm my father's younger
daughter speaking.

1231
01:33:57,674 --> 01:34:00,994
Sir, Preeti...I mean,
your daughter is on the phone.

1232
01:34:02,994 --> 01:34:04,714
Take this.

1233
01:34:05,954 --> 01:34:07,634
Yes, Preeti.

1234
01:34:07,794 --> 01:34:11,194
Hello, Dad. I'm very angry with you.
I will not talk to you.

1235
01:34:11,434 --> 01:34:14,114
But you are talking to me.

1236
01:34:14,314 --> 01:34:17,714
If you don't reach home within
half an hour, I'll never talk to you.

1237
01:34:17,874 --> 01:34:21,354
We have arrested a criminal.

1238
01:34:21,714 --> 01:34:25,594
We are questioning him and
trying to trace his companions.

1239
01:34:25,794 --> 01:34:27,554
Dad, where are his companions hiding?

1240
01:34:27,714 --> 01:34:29,994
Somewhere here.
They must be hiding in the same town.

1241
01:34:30,114 --> 01:34:33,234
Mom, dad's arrested a criminal.

1242
01:34:33,314 --> 01:34:34,914
He has to arrest his companion..

1243
01:34:34,994 --> 01:34:36,314
..who is hiding around here somewhere.

1244
01:34:36,514 --> 01:34:38,834
Give me the phone.
- Hello, Dad.

1245
01:34:38,994 --> 01:34:40,314
It got disconnected.

1246
01:34:40,754 --> 01:34:42,314
He is not bothered about his health.

1247
01:34:42,634 --> 01:34:43,634
He hasn't eaten
anything since morning.

1248
01:34:43,994 --> 01:34:46,234
Shall I take dinner for him?

1249
01:34:46,434 --> 01:34:49,314
Yes, that would be good. Come with me.

1250
01:34:50,914 --> 01:34:52,674
Don't just deliver
the dinner and leave.

1251
01:34:52,905 --> 01:34:55,034
Make sure he finishes
his dinner before you leave.

1252
01:34:55,586 --> 01:34:57,034
Don't worry about it.

1253
01:34:57,640 --> 01:35:01,154
Badal, you never told us
about your family?

1254
01:35:04,386 --> 01:35:05,154
I have nobody.

1255
01:35:05,474 --> 01:35:08,474
I mean, your parents,
brothers and sisters?

1256
01:35:11,748 --> 01:35:14,474
I have nobody.
- Don't say that.

1257
01:35:14,873 --> 01:35:19,434
We're here for you.
- What do you say, my sweet brother?!

1258
01:35:19,514 --> 01:35:23,234
I love my brother. How sweet.

1259
01:35:23,987 --> 01:35:25,594
Sahab Singh.

1260
01:35:26,506 --> 01:35:30,274
The stick can only hurt the body,
not the soul.

1261
01:35:31,252 --> 01:35:33,554
Until their conscience awakens..

1262
01:35:33,923 --> 01:35:37,154
..they will not follow
a righteous path.

1263
01:35:41,145 --> 01:35:43,674
It's your last chance.

1264
01:35:43,977 --> 01:35:47,263
Think again.
Tell me everything clearly.

1265
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:49,914
Did you understand?

1266
01:35:54,463 --> 01:35:56,474
Got you.

1267
01:35:56,874 --> 01:35:59,382
For a moment I thought I was caught.

1268
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:03,620
Look, that guy's face resembles mine.

1269
01:36:04,474 --> 01:36:07,122
If I had a beard and moustache,
you would've locked me up.

1270
01:36:08,917 --> 01:36:11,514
Do you think I'm mad?

1271
01:36:11,706 --> 01:36:13,879
Don't I know the difference..

1272
01:36:13,959 --> 01:36:19,371
..between a terrorist's eyes
and the eyes of an innocent boy?

1273
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:23,122
Why did you come here?
- I have brought food for you.

1274
01:36:25,036 --> 01:36:28,594
I told Simran not to send any food.
In spite of that, you're here.

1275
01:36:28,674 --> 01:36:31,728
Our wives are bigger officers than us.

1276
01:36:31,808 --> 01:36:34,960
They dominate us at home,
and also in the office.

1277
01:36:35,514 --> 01:36:36,394
Speak, you rascal.

1278
01:36:36,514 --> 01:36:39,314
Enough, Sahab Singh. Enough!

1279
01:36:39,394 --> 01:36:41,954
Come have some food.
- Yes, sir.

1280
01:36:48,234 --> 01:36:49,706
Did you give him anything to eat?

1281
01:36:49,786 --> 01:36:53,354
Sir, let it be.
If you keep him hungry, he will talk.

1282
01:36:54,409 --> 01:36:57,457
In my experience, people who
don't respond to physical abuse..

1283
01:36:57,537 --> 01:36:59,514
..will respond to love.

1284
01:37:00,992 --> 01:37:01,874
Mangeyram.

1285
01:37:02,234 --> 01:37:04,634
Why don't you..
- Shall I?

1286
01:37:04,714 --> 01:37:08,314
Yes. Here, give it to him. Go on.

1287
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,754
Have some food.

1288
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:40,354
Don't worry.
I'll rescue you very soon.

1289
01:37:41,923 --> 01:37:43,621
Sahab Singh.
- Yes, sir.

1290
01:37:43,701 --> 01:37:48,994
If he comes clean tonight,
we'll keep him in the lock up.

1291
01:37:50,064 --> 01:37:52,674
If not, we'll get the court
to sanction a 14-day jail sentence.

1292
01:37:52,754 --> 01:37:54,074
Okay.

1293
01:37:58,474 --> 01:38:00,434
Shall I leave?

1294
01:38:01,512 --> 01:38:07,448
Yes. Tell Simran I may
not return home tonight.

1295
01:38:08,410 --> 01:38:12,594
Sir, there is a wedding in your house.
Guests have come over.

1296
01:38:12,842 --> 01:38:14,074
Go home.

1297
01:38:14,258 --> 01:38:15,314
I'm right here.

1298
01:38:15,621 --> 01:38:18,234
He won't try to escape
from the lock up.

1299
01:38:18,314 --> 01:38:19,834
Okay.

1300
01:38:20,485 --> 01:38:22,354
Goodnight.
- Goodnight, sir.

1301
01:38:22,554 --> 01:38:25,114
Badal, today I'll
ride your motorcycle.

1302
01:38:25,194 --> 01:38:29,404
"You've been lucky.
You will be lucky."

1303
01:38:29,631 --> 01:38:31,674
Oh, God.

1304
01:38:31,754 --> 01:38:35,198
"You've been lucky.
You will be lucky."

1305
01:38:35,278 --> 01:38:36,463
Why do you keep doing that?

1306
01:38:36,543 --> 01:38:39,874
Have you come here for
your honeymoon or to get drunk?

1307
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:43,813
What's the fun of a
honeymoon without drinks?

1308
01:38:43,986 --> 01:38:46,764
It's been three days. As soon
as you get to the hotel, go to bed.

1309
01:38:46,844 --> 01:38:50,461
You're not even
enjoying the honeymoon.

1310
01:38:50,624 --> 01:38:52,424
Are you challenging me?

1311
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:54,784
You are challenging Guler Rangoli?

1312
01:38:54,864 --> 01:38:57,584
If I get angry,
I will continue to drink.

1313
01:38:57,744 --> 01:38:59,224
And there will be no
honey or the moon of any kind.

1314
01:38:59,304 --> 01:39:02,824
Enough. If this horse hears it,
it will laugh.

1315
01:39:02,904 --> 01:39:04,744
Do you feed grams to him?

1316
01:39:04,984 --> 01:39:06,824
You're comparing me to a horse.
Am I a horse?

1317
01:39:06,944 --> 01:39:10,024
Be grateful that I compared you
to a horse and not a donkey. - Donkey?

1318
01:39:10,212 --> 01:39:11,584
Am I a donkey?

1319
01:39:11,664 --> 01:39:15,744
This is not done.
She just called her husband a donkey.

1320
01:39:15,919 --> 01:39:20,184
People? Is anybody there?
Did anyone hear this?

1321
01:39:20,264 --> 01:39:23,784
She called me a donkey.
I am not a donkey.

1322
01:39:23,864 --> 01:39:25,504
I will tell you. I..

1323
01:39:25,693 --> 01:39:29,904
Mister, what's the matter?
Why are you creating a ruckus?

1324
01:39:30,064 --> 01:39:32,624
My wife..
- Yes?

1325
01:39:32,795 --> 01:39:36,384
..calls me a donkey and a horse.
Isn't it wrong?

1326
01:39:36,544 --> 01:39:38,264
Yes.
- Isn't that wrong?

1327
01:39:38,344 --> 01:39:43,424
Sister, if you call a blind
person blind, he won't feel bad.

1328
01:39:43,504 --> 01:39:46,304
Yes, you're absolutely right.
- Does that mean I'm blind?

1329
01:39:46,384 --> 01:39:48,904
Yes. - You are the eldest,
so I asked you for your opinion.

1330
01:39:48,984 --> 01:39:50,144
And you are calling me a blind person.

1331
01:39:50,224 --> 01:39:52,584
Listen, this is not right.

1332
01:39:53,423 --> 01:39:56,784
Sister, he is very drunk.
Take him to the hotel.

1333
01:39:57,024 --> 01:39:58,224
Fine. Come to the hotel.

1334
01:39:58,304 --> 01:40:00,817
I'll show you if I'm a donkey,
horse or a blind man! - Come on.

1335
01:40:00,897 --> 01:40:03,184
Let's go.
- Go on!

1336
01:40:15,715 --> 01:40:20,304
Nathuram!
- Welcome! A.C.P.

1337
01:40:20,384 --> 01:40:23,163
I will have to cancel
your bar's license.

1338
01:40:23,336 --> 01:40:24,925
Do you know what time it is?

1339
01:40:26,351 --> 01:40:30,464
Sharma has won the
tournament from Dehradun.

1340
01:40:30,544 --> 01:40:32,513
He has thrown a party
to celebrate his victory.

1341
01:40:32,593 --> 01:40:34,464
Even the collector is here.

1342
01:40:34,584 --> 01:40:37,584
Collector.
- Welcome!

1343
01:40:37,664 --> 01:40:39,344
Join us for a celebration.

1344
01:40:40,968 --> 01:40:42,514
Well done, boys.

1345
01:40:42,594 --> 01:40:45,692
We are proud of you.
- You deserve a drink, Ranjeet.

1346
01:40:45,772 --> 01:40:47,384
You've arrested a terrorist.

1347
01:40:49,055 --> 01:40:52,624
Thanks.
- Thanks is not enough, Nathu.

1348
01:40:52,704 --> 01:40:54,864
Get a drink for the A.C.P.

1349
01:40:55,239 --> 01:40:57,144
Okay.

1350
01:41:01,045 --> 01:41:02,384
Ranjeet.
- Yes.

1351
01:41:02,464 --> 01:41:03,984
Who is this guy?

1352
01:41:04,064 --> 01:41:06,709
He is..
- Your son, he has grown up.

1353
01:41:06,789 --> 01:41:08,808
You didn't tell me.

1354
01:41:08,968 --> 01:41:12,168
No, Suri. He is not my son.

1355
01:41:12,579 --> 01:41:15,808
But he is like a son.

1356
01:41:15,888 --> 01:41:19,568
So he's your son.
- Here you are, sir.

1357
01:41:22,088 --> 01:41:25,568
Come on, young man.
Pick up a glass. Don't be shy.

1358
01:41:25,648 --> 01:41:26,888
I don't drink.

1359
01:41:27,008 --> 01:41:31,928
Ranjeet, unless you don't
tell him he won't touch alcohol.

1360
01:41:32,805 --> 01:41:35,008
Take it. After raising a toast,
you can put it back.

1361
01:41:39,410 --> 01:41:41,648
Cheers.
- Cheers.

1362
01:41:44,888 --> 01:41:46,608
You know, Badal..

1363
01:41:48,048 --> 01:41:50,408
Why did I drink today?

1364
01:41:54,408 --> 01:41:57,808
When the collector
unknowingly thought..

1365
01:41:59,568 --> 01:42:01,528
..that you were my son..

1366
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:05,288
..I felt very good.

1367
01:42:08,447 --> 01:42:10,168
It reminded me of Bablu.

1368
01:42:14,248 --> 01:42:15,368
Bablu?

1369
01:42:16,501 --> 01:42:17,648
Yes.

1370
01:42:17,884 --> 01:42:23,888
My son was four years
old when he died.

1371
01:42:27,432 --> 01:42:29,888
If he had been alive today..

1372
01:42:31,659 --> 01:42:33,648
..he would have been your age.

1373
01:42:40,448 --> 01:42:44,178
I've been doing all the talking.
Why don't you say something?

1374
01:42:47,259 --> 01:42:48,524
Take this.

1375
01:42:50,188 --> 01:42:54,248
Have a glass. Here.
- No, sir. Not me.

1376
01:42:54,408 --> 01:42:57,848
Why are you calling me sir?

1377
01:42:57,928 --> 01:43:00,768
You are my Bablu.

1378
01:43:02,572 --> 01:43:07,808
When a son grows up,
he becomes a friend.

1379
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:13,888
Today have a drink as my friend.
Drink it.

1380
01:43:14,624 --> 01:43:16,527
Drink it.

1381
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:19,728
It's inappropriate for a son
to be drunk in front of his mother.

1382
01:43:23,553 --> 01:43:27,368
You referred to Simran as your mother?
- A mother is a mother.

1383
01:43:30,332 --> 01:43:32,848
Very good, son! Very good.

1384
01:43:35,408 --> 01:43:39,928
Today you've made me really happy.

1385
01:43:59,448 --> 01:44:00,688
Badal..

1386
01:44:03,629 --> 01:44:06,472
..let's go to Circuit House.
- Circuit House?

1387
01:44:06,552 --> 01:44:09,248
Yes. The police have
arrested a terrorist there.

1388
01:44:09,328 --> 01:44:10,883
Let's go see him.

1389
01:44:10,963 --> 01:44:13,368
Badal, I've never seen a terrorist.

1390
01:44:13,448 --> 01:44:14,851
God knows what they look like.

1391
01:44:14,931 --> 01:44:17,288
He probably has a big moustache..

1392
01:44:17,368 --> 01:44:21,128
..long hair, red eyes and bad teeth.

1393
01:44:21,208 --> 01:44:24,968
I'm sure he looks like a demon.

1394
01:44:25,048 --> 01:44:28,569
No one is born a terrorist.

1395
01:44:28,807 --> 01:44:32,968
He is neither a demon, nor a beast.

1396
01:44:33,683 --> 01:44:38,368
In fact, his mind has
been poisoned with hatred.

1397
01:44:38,645 --> 01:44:41,088
You want to see a terrorist?

1398
01:44:41,423 --> 01:44:43,208
A son that's probably
been snatched from his mother..

1399
01:44:43,288 --> 01:44:45,498
..a brother from his sister..

1400
01:44:45,578 --> 01:44:47,228
..and he is orphaned.

1401
01:44:49,791 --> 01:44:52,894
Nobody picks up a weapon
because they want to.

1402
01:44:53,996 --> 01:44:56,872
He's forced into it.

1403
01:44:58,088 --> 01:45:00,732
Go! Go and see him.

1404
01:45:00,812 --> 01:45:04,968
But try to look for
the pain in his eyes.

1405
01:45:05,413 --> 01:45:08,968
That's what keeps
these terrorists alive.

1406
01:45:09,293 --> 01:45:12,888
Want to see a terrorist? Terrorist!

1407
01:45:25,330 --> 01:45:27,330
Your name is not Jeetram..

1408
01:45:28,981 --> 01:45:31,290
..and you're not a cloth merchant.

1409
01:45:33,090 --> 01:45:35,410
You are a terrorist.

1410
01:45:37,330 --> 01:45:41,450
Your friends are hiding in
Sunder Nagar. Tell us who they are.

1411
01:45:42,732 --> 01:45:45,010
Who are you planning to kill?

1412
01:45:45,726 --> 01:45:49,090
You may kill me.

1413
01:45:50,116 --> 01:45:54,170
The truth is that I'm not a terrorist.

1414
01:45:55,716 --> 01:45:57,890
You will die.

1415
01:45:58,333 --> 01:46:01,010
Why are you making it difficult
for yourself? You will die in pain.

1416
01:46:02,290 --> 01:46:03,570
Die!

1417
01:46:04,971 --> 01:46:07,263
Who likes to die, Rana?

1418
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:12,250
Today, it's me.
Tomorrow, it will be you.

1419
01:46:12,330 --> 01:46:14,650
You are very determined.

1420
01:46:18,096 --> 01:46:20,050
But you don't know me.

1421
01:46:22,650 --> 01:46:24,570
No.

1422
01:46:24,730 --> 01:46:30,210
D.I.G., what are you doing?

1423
01:46:30,831 --> 01:46:34,250
He will die like this.
- So what should I do?

1424
01:46:35,545 --> 01:46:37,930
Should I greet him with garlands?

1425
01:46:38,050 --> 01:46:41,770
I mean, he might be a criminal,
but he is still human.

1426
01:46:45,479 --> 01:46:47,530
Thank you.

1427
01:46:47,976 --> 01:46:51,970
Very insightful. My life is blessed!

1428
01:46:52,873 --> 01:46:56,610
Where are your feet?
- What are you doing, sir?

1429
01:46:57,050 --> 01:46:59,130
I am asking for your blessings.

1430
01:46:59,717 --> 01:47:03,970
What is your name?
- A.C.P. Ranjeet Singh.

1431
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:08,610
And who am I?
- D.I.G. Jai Singh Rana.

1432
01:47:08,690 --> 01:47:11,749
What is the difference
between the earth and the sky?

1433
01:47:11,829 --> 01:47:16,650
Do you know or should I tell you?
You crazy junior.

1434
01:47:16,730 --> 01:47:19,327
How dare you interfere in my work?

1435
01:47:19,407 --> 01:47:24,290
D.I.G., I might be your junior..

1436
01:47:24,775 --> 01:47:28,490
..but that does not give you the
right to talk to me in this manner.

1437
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:32,210
Under the law we are not permitted..

1438
01:47:32,290 --> 01:47:34,797
..to treat people like animals.

1439
01:47:34,877 --> 01:47:38,970
I know how to behave with these guys.

1440
01:47:40,203 --> 01:47:42,010
I don't take orders!

1441
01:47:43,565 --> 01:47:45,250
I give orders!

1442
01:47:45,890 --> 01:47:49,479
No go search every the
nook and cranny of this city.

1443
01:47:49,933 --> 01:47:52,970
And find out where
his companions are hiding.

1444
01:47:53,296 --> 01:47:57,545
I want it done fast!
Is that clear? - Yes.

1445
01:47:57,625 --> 01:48:00,850
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1446
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:02,330
Now get lost.

1447
01:48:11,686 --> 01:48:15,370
People who used to
sell the antidote of love..

1448
01:48:16,918 --> 01:48:19,570
..have become prosperous.

1449
01:48:21,534 --> 01:48:24,010
You have answered all my questions.

1450
01:48:25,177 --> 01:48:27,530
Do you have an answer
for this question?

1451
01:48:34,219 --> 01:48:40,539
Rana bought explosives
and gunpowder from me.

1452
01:48:41,770 --> 01:48:45,499
So, you have lost.

1453
01:48:51,499 --> 01:48:55,459
Why did you want the explosives?
Tell me.

1454
01:48:57,272 --> 01:49:01,579
Tell me. For God's sake. Tell me!

1455
01:49:02,548 --> 01:49:05,499
Tell me.

1456
01:49:07,089 --> 01:49:08,939
He lost consciousness.

1457
01:49:10,214 --> 01:49:12,579
He will speak when
he regains consciousness.

1458
01:49:14,592 --> 01:49:16,939
Listen.
- Yes.

1459
01:49:17,566 --> 01:49:19,179
What happened?

1460
01:49:19,868 --> 01:49:22,939
He will die, Simran.
- Who?

1461
01:49:23,523 --> 01:49:26,561
He will die. I will..

1462
01:50:01,379 --> 01:50:08,179
"The days to steal
a heart have arrived."

1463
01:50:08,517 --> 01:50:15,779
"The days to steal
a heart have arrived."

1464
01:50:16,203 --> 01:50:20,379
"The days to go crazy have arrived."

1465
01:50:20,499 --> 01:50:25,019
"The days to get
wounded have arrived."

1466
01:50:33,139 --> 01:50:37,059
"Oh, God. I'm young again."

1467
01:50:37,139 --> 01:50:40,619
"Oh, God! Where is he?"

1468
01:50:41,026 --> 01:50:44,979
"Oh, God! I'm young again."

1469
01:50:45,059 --> 01:50:48,459
"Oh, God! Where is he?"

1470
01:50:48,776 --> 01:50:52,820
"Come, beloved. I am burning up."

1471
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:57,047
"What is this fire that has no smoke?"

1472
01:50:57,127 --> 01:51:01,004
"Oh, God. I'm young again."

1473
01:51:01,084 --> 01:51:04,733
"Oh, God. Where is he?"

1474
01:51:04,813 --> 01:51:09,036
"Oh, God. I'm young again."

1475
01:51:09,116 --> 01:51:14,059
"Oh, God! Where is he?"

1476
01:51:41,276 --> 01:51:44,476
"What kind of pain is this?"

1477
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:49,076
"I like this restlessness."

1478
01:51:49,156 --> 01:51:53,196
"Day and night don't pass easily."

1479
01:51:53,316 --> 01:51:56,116
"Beloved, without you.."

1480
01:51:56,716 --> 01:52:00,716
"..slowly and gradually,
this heart beats."

1481
01:52:00,796 --> 01:52:02,756
"What kind of ecstasy is this?"

1482
01:52:02,836 --> 01:52:04,996
"I like being lonely."

1483
01:52:05,076 --> 01:52:06,996
"My heartbeats are impatient."

1484
01:52:07,076 --> 01:52:09,156
"My desires are getting ahead of me."

1485
01:52:09,276 --> 01:52:13,196
"Oh, God! I'm young again."

1486
01:52:13,356 --> 01:52:16,756
"Oh, God! Where is he?"

1487
01:52:16,972 --> 01:52:21,476
"Oh God! I have become young."

1488
01:52:21,556 --> 01:52:25,316
"Oh God! Where is he?"

1489
01:52:59,316 --> 01:53:02,836
"Ever since you locked eyes with me.."

1490
01:53:03,196 --> 01:53:06,716
"..I have become ignorant."

1491
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:11,236
"It has started affecting me."

1492
01:53:11,396 --> 01:53:14,796
"The poison is spreading."

1493
01:53:14,876 --> 01:53:18,796
"A spell has been cast.
This distance is torturing me."

1494
01:53:18,876 --> 01:53:23,036
"Hold me in your arms.
And do whatever you want."

1495
01:53:23,116 --> 01:53:25,036
"Admire me. Love me."

1496
01:53:25,156 --> 01:53:27,236
"Don't harass me, beloved."

1497
01:53:27,356 --> 01:53:31,436
"Oh, God! I have become young."

1498
01:53:31,516 --> 01:53:34,836
"Oh, God! Where is he?"

1499
01:53:34,956 --> 01:53:39,516
"Oh, God! I'm young again."

1500
01:53:39,596 --> 01:53:43,036
"Oh, God! Where is he?"

1501
01:53:43,116 --> 01:53:47,236
"Come, beloved. I am burning up."

1502
01:53:47,356 --> 01:53:51,276
"What is this fire that has no smoke?"

1503
01:53:51,396 --> 01:53:55,636
"Oh, God! I'm young again."

1504
01:53:55,716 --> 01:53:58,996
"Oh, God! Where is he?"

1505
01:53:59,076 --> 01:54:03,516
"Oh, God! I'm young again."

1506
01:54:03,596 --> 01:54:07,556
"Oh, God! Where is he?"

1507
01:54:11,716 --> 01:54:14,196
"Oh, God!"

1508
01:54:15,556 --> 01:54:18,396
"I have become young."

1509
01:54:19,836 --> 01:54:23,036
"Oh, God!"

1510
01:54:42,156 --> 01:54:43,516
Hey.

1511
01:54:45,077 --> 01:54:46,196
Stop.

1512
01:55:40,316 --> 01:55:41,257
Go.

1513
01:55:59,510 --> 01:56:00,750
Raj.

1514
01:56:03,230 --> 01:56:04,310
Raj.

1515
01:56:05,870 --> 01:56:09,110
I can't run with you.

1516
01:56:09,353 --> 01:56:14,870
I don't have any strength left.

1517
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:18,550
You run away, son.

1518
01:56:18,790 --> 01:56:20,550
Run away.
- No!

1519
01:56:20,630 --> 01:56:22,990
I can't leave you here to die.
Come on.

1520
01:56:23,110 --> 01:56:25,990
Don't be stubborn.

1521
01:56:27,230 --> 01:56:31,950
Life and death don't go hand in hand.

1522
01:56:33,230 --> 01:56:36,590
What lies ahead of me is death.

1523
01:56:37,790 --> 01:56:41,550
What lies ahead of you is your life..

1524
01:56:42,110 --> 01:56:43,670
..your mission!

1525
01:56:45,750 --> 01:56:49,830
You have to kill Rana.

1526
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:52,790
Kill Rana.

1527
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:57,790
Run away.

1528
01:56:58,215 --> 01:57:00,790
Run away.
- Come with me!

1529
01:57:00,870 --> 01:57:02,550
Come on!

1530
01:57:03,830 --> 01:57:09,190
Will you do me a favour?

1531
01:57:15,150 --> 01:57:16,990
Shoot me.

1532
01:57:18,367 --> 01:57:19,870
Yes, son.

1533
01:57:20,292 --> 01:57:24,430
When life becomes
worse than death.. - No.

1534
01:57:24,735 --> 01:57:27,590
..it should be liberated. - No.

1535
01:57:28,021 --> 01:57:32,510
If the police capture me..

1536
01:57:32,713 --> 01:57:36,790
..I won't be able to
endure their torture any more.

1537
01:57:40,790 --> 01:57:42,630
Shoot me.

1538
01:57:43,589 --> 01:57:46,110
Give me salvation.

1539
01:57:59,990 --> 01:58:03,790
Son, God will protect you.

1540
01:58:17,129 --> 01:58:20,809
Great. Your security is great.

1541
01:58:21,876 --> 01:58:26,049
A terrorist rescued his
companion from police custody..

1542
01:58:26,633 --> 01:58:28,849
..and you didn't even know about it.

1543
01:58:30,309 --> 01:58:34,409
D.I.G., it is evident
that I was alert..

1544
01:58:34,809 --> 01:58:37,449
..because I brought
Jeetram's corpse to you.

1545
01:58:37,569 --> 01:58:39,769
Don't talk to me about corpses.

1546
01:58:40,277 --> 01:58:44,369
I want the person who killed him.

1547
01:58:44,882 --> 01:58:47,809
I'm sure his companions
are hiding in this city.

1548
01:58:49,449 --> 01:58:51,089
Find them.

1549
01:58:53,609 --> 01:58:57,169
Or these terrorists will
convert our city into a graveyard.

1550
02:00:59,529 --> 02:01:01,809
Mr. Satyaprakash,
you're making a mistake.

1551
02:01:02,409 --> 02:01:04,609
You should not visit
this village again.

1552
02:01:04,689 --> 02:01:07,809
Why? Isn't this village
a part of my country?

1553
02:01:07,889 --> 02:01:09,769
That's not the point, Mr.
Satyaprakash.

1554
02:01:10,809 --> 02:01:13,849
Dangerous terrorists
live in this village.

1555
02:01:14,332 --> 02:01:17,969
For the last ten days, there
has been a curfew in this village.

1556
02:01:18,609 --> 02:01:21,689
Nobody can enter,
or leave, this village.

1557
02:01:23,089 --> 02:01:26,095
We have cut off the food supply,
electricity and everything else.

1558
02:01:26,175 --> 02:01:28,993
But by cutting the supply
of food and electricity..

1559
02:01:29,073 --> 02:01:30,809
..you've not helped them.

1560
02:01:31,129 --> 02:01:32,969
In fact,
you've made things much worse.

1561
02:01:33,300 --> 02:01:35,180
I agree that they are terrorists.

1562
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:36,780
But why are you punishing
innocent women..

1563
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:38,380
..and children for
crimes they did not commit?

1564
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:39,660
Then what should we do?

1565
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:41,860
Should we let these beasts run loose..

1566
02:01:41,940 --> 02:01:43,740
..and allow them
to kill innocent people?

1567
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:49,420
The people who you call beasts today,
were also innocent once.

1568
02:01:50,180 --> 02:01:51,780
There must have been
some injustice done to them,..

1569
02:01:51,860 --> 02:01:53,460
..which forced them to take up arms.

1570
02:01:55,060 --> 02:01:57,420
An eye for an eye is a good maxim
to follow when you're at the border.

1571
02:01:57,500 --> 02:01:59,100
But it is not something to
follow in the villages of our country.

1572
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:03,500
People live in these villages.

1573
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:07,740
They are not dangerous beasts.

1574
02:02:09,580 --> 02:02:13,100
They will not reform.
- That's what you believe.

1575
02:02:13,768 --> 02:02:17,260
If a robber like Ratnakar
can become Sage Valmiki..

1576
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:19,260
..then why can't these
people change as well?

1577
02:02:20,540 --> 02:02:24,780
One more thing, D.I.G.
Jai Singh Rana..

1578
02:02:26,180 --> 02:02:30,820
..even if these people shoot at me,
your men should not fire.

1579
02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:34,300
Sharma, give it to me.
- Here.

1580
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:35,940
Vande Mataram
(Pledge to the motherland).

1581
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:37,380
Vande Mataram
(Pledge to the motherland).

1582
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:38,660
Vande Mataram
(Pledge to the motherland).

1583
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:40,540
Vande Mataram
(Pledge to the motherland).

1584
02:02:54,825 --> 02:02:59,340
If your children's hunger is satiated
by killing me, then shoot me. Shoot.

1585
02:02:59,420 --> 02:03:02,500
What is that he is carrying?
What if they are explosives?

1586
02:03:16,380 --> 02:03:19,460
Please have some. - Father, have some.
You must be hungry.

1587
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:22,940
Son, if I eat this food..

1588
02:03:23,020 --> 02:03:25,340
..then I'll have to spend
the rest of my life in prison.

1589
02:03:25,420 --> 02:03:27,220
That won't happen.

1590
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:29,620
The government has made me a
promise that that won't happen to you.

1591
02:03:29,846 --> 02:03:32,220
No injustice will be done to you..

1592
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:34,020
..if you surrender yourselves.

1593
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:36,780
Listen to them, brother.

1594
02:03:36,860 --> 02:03:38,540
The children have been
starving for many days.

1595
02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:40,980
We are all hungry and starving.

1596
02:03:47,047 --> 02:03:50,380
I have a message
from my superiors, Rana.

1597
02:03:55,620 --> 02:03:59,020
Lately, your superiors
send too many messages..

1598
02:03:59,980 --> 02:04:01,660
..and not much of a reward.

1599
02:04:02,580 --> 02:04:07,940
This time the reward is enormous.
You will be tired of counting money.

1600
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:10,580
Really? - Yes.

1601
02:04:11,772 --> 02:04:17,300
The I.S.I. has deposited Rs.150
million in your Swiss bank account.

1602
02:04:22,475 --> 02:04:25,140
I'll kill my own mother
for so much money.

1603
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:29,220
Don't kill your mother.
Kill Satyaprakash.

1604
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:33,940
He wants to end terrorism.

1605
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:36,140
When?
- 15th August.

1606
02:04:38,183 --> 02:04:39,660
What if I kill him today?

1607
02:04:39,740 --> 02:04:43,660
Rana, you don't know
how to make people suffer.

1608
02:04:44,366 --> 02:04:49,500
When the entire country
is celebrating Independence Day..

1609
02:04:49,580 --> 02:04:54,620
..it would be great
if an explosion took place.

1610
02:04:56,432 --> 02:04:58,900
I'll be waiting for
the 15th of August.

1611
02:05:32,627 --> 02:05:36,107
"My sweetheart took my heart away."

1612
02:05:36,187 --> 02:05:39,747
"And left me with pain
at such a young age."

1613
02:05:39,827 --> 02:05:43,347
"My sweetheart took my heart away."

1614
02:05:43,467 --> 02:05:46,867
"And left me with pain
at such a young age." "

1615
02:05:50,467 --> 02:05:54,627
"My heart jumps when I see you.
My heartbeats say.."

1616
02:05:57,627 --> 02:06:01,267
"My heart jumps when I see you.
My heartbeats say.."

1617
02:06:01,347 --> 02:06:04,850
"My heart jumps when I see you.
My heartbeats say.."

1618
02:06:04,930 --> 02:06:08,387
"..tomorrow."

1619
02:06:08,507 --> 02:06:13,187
"I'll pass by your lane tomorrow.
You stand by the window, my love."

1620
02:06:15,587 --> 02:06:19,747
"My heart jumps when I see you.
My heartbeats say.."

1621
02:06:22,867 --> 02:06:26,427
"My heart jumps when I see you.
My heartbeats say.."

1622
02:06:26,507 --> 02:06:30,147
"My heart jumps when I see you.
My heartbeats say.."

1623
02:06:30,227 --> 02:06:33,547
"..oh, young guy."

1624
02:06:33,627 --> 02:06:35,507
"I'm a young man from
Punjab (state in India).

1625
02:06:35,587 --> 02:06:38,307
Would you be my Punjabi wife?"

1626
02:06:40,787 --> 02:06:42,627
"I'm a young man from
Punjab (state in India).

1627
02:06:42,707 --> 02:06:44,547
Would you be my Punjabi wife?"

1628
02:06:44,627 --> 02:06:49,187
"I'll pass by your lane tomorrow.
You stand by the window, my love."

1629
02:06:57,387 --> 02:07:00,867
"My love took my heart away."

1630
02:07:00,947 --> 02:07:04,507
"And left me with pain
at such a young age."

1631
02:07:04,587 --> 02:07:08,187
"My love took my heart away."

1632
02:07:08,267 --> 02:07:11,547
"And left me with pain
at such a young age."

1633
02:07:18,547 --> 02:07:21,867
"My sweetheart, hold me in your arms."

1634
02:07:22,227 --> 02:07:25,627
"My sweetheart, hold me in your arms."

1635
02:07:25,707 --> 02:07:29,387
"I beg of you, make me your bride."

1636
02:07:29,507 --> 02:07:32,987
"My sweetheart, hold me in your arms."

1637
02:07:33,107 --> 02:07:36,507
"You said my name so sweetly."

1638
02:07:36,587 --> 02:07:40,107
"I had to come and hold you."

1639
02:07:40,187 --> 02:07:43,787
"Our eyes talked."

1640
02:07:43,867 --> 02:07:47,587
"You called out to me
with your heart and we met."

1641
02:07:47,667 --> 02:07:51,387
"Come quickly with my palanquin."

1642
02:07:54,747 --> 02:07:59,427
"Let the band play at my doorstep too,
sweetheart."

1643
02:08:02,067 --> 02:08:05,667
"I'm a young man from Punjab.
Be my Punjabi wife."

1644
02:08:05,747 --> 02:08:09,827
"I'll pass by your lane tomorrow.
You stand by the window."

1645
02:08:59,107 --> 02:09:02,507
"Let our love grow."

1646
02:09:03,187 --> 02:09:06,227
"Let our love grow."

1647
02:09:07,027 --> 02:09:13,267
"The world is a jealous place,
so let it be."

1648
02:09:13,347 --> 02:09:17,307
"Let our love grow."

1649
02:09:17,707 --> 02:09:21,227
"I don't care about what others say."

1650
02:09:21,307 --> 02:09:24,747
"I love only you."

1651
02:09:24,827 --> 02:09:28,347
"I see you.
I ask for you. I love you."

1652
02:09:28,467 --> 02:09:32,107
"Let me hug you and
show you my consent."

1653
02:09:32,227 --> 02:09:36,507
"I'll shield you in my arms
and I'll always think of you first."

1654
02:09:39,507 --> 02:09:43,667
"Just give me a sign
and I'll take you away."

1655
02:09:46,667 --> 02:09:50,307
"My heart jumps when I see you.
My heartbeats say.."

1656
02:09:50,387 --> 02:09:53,729
"My heart jumps when I see you.
My heartbeats say.."

1657
02:09:53,809 --> 02:09:57,182
"My heart jumps when I see you.
My heartbeats say.."

1658
02:09:57,365 --> 02:10:00,845
"..I'm a young man from Punjab.
Be my Punjabi wife."

1659
02:10:00,965 --> 02:10:04,605
"I'll pass by your lane tomorrow.
You stand by the window."

1660
02:10:04,685 --> 02:10:06,605
Badal, where were you? Come here.

1661
02:10:06,685 --> 02:10:08,285
"My love took away my heart."

1662
02:10:08,365 --> 02:10:11,645
"And he gave me the pain of youth."

1663
02:10:15,785 --> 02:10:17,665
Give me a bottle.
- Here.

1664
02:10:17,825 --> 02:10:19,265
Give me four more.

1665
02:10:20,985 --> 02:10:23,705
Mister, you're not permitted
to drink in the shop.

1666
02:10:23,905 --> 02:10:26,625
Really? We can buy liquor here,
but we can't drink it?

1667
02:10:26,785 --> 02:10:28,705
No problem.

1668
02:10:33,185 --> 02:10:35,385
You made me lose Rs. 250.

1669
02:10:35,585 --> 02:10:37,425
You pushed me.

1670
02:10:37,985 --> 02:10:40,345
I know you.

1671
02:10:40,505 --> 02:10:41,785
You had beaten me up previously.

1672
02:10:41,865 --> 02:10:43,745
It's because of you that
my neck has become crooked.

1673
02:10:43,825 --> 02:10:44,985
It's like one-way traffic.

1674
02:10:45,105 --> 02:10:46,905
You beat me and you ran away.

1675
02:10:46,985 --> 02:10:49,745
Billo. Look, I have caught him.

1676
02:10:49,825 --> 02:10:52,345
Come quickly,
or he'll beat me up again.

1677
02:10:52,425 --> 02:10:54,785
This is the same guy with weapons.

1678
02:10:57,145 --> 02:10:58,665
Oh, God. You wrecked my Guler.

1679
02:10:58,745 --> 02:11:00,705
I hope you rot in hell.

1680
02:11:00,865 --> 02:11:02,665
Grab him. - Keep quiet.

1681
02:11:02,745 --> 02:11:05,545
What happened? My neck feels fine now.

1682
02:11:05,705 --> 02:11:06,905
Really.

1683
02:11:39,905 --> 02:11:42,785
Hey, you. Where are you coming from?

1684
02:11:43,065 --> 02:11:45,385
That alcohol!

1685
02:11:46,065 --> 02:11:50,105
Some day your drinking
will put all of us in harms way.

1686
02:11:58,945 --> 02:12:00,185
Who are you?

1687
02:12:00,305 --> 02:12:02,865
It seems we both were
looking for one another.

1688
02:12:03,421 --> 02:12:05,425
I want the explosives.

1689
02:12:05,505 --> 02:12:08,745
I see. So you are the one.

1690
02:12:09,945 --> 02:12:11,505
Where is the money?

1691
02:12:11,745 --> 02:12:15,745
Where are the goods?
- Money first.

1692
02:12:15,985 --> 02:12:20,585
Fine. I'll meet you here
in a short while with the money.

1693
02:12:20,705 --> 02:12:22,505
I'll be waiting for you.

1694
02:12:39,585 --> 02:12:40,425
What are you doing here?

1695
02:12:40,705 --> 02:12:44,865
I thought you'd get tired
of carrying this heavy load.

1696
02:12:45,145 --> 02:12:47,985
You haven't seen my strength yet.

1697
02:12:48,705 --> 02:12:51,385
Your strength is useless
against this pistol.

1698
02:12:51,465 --> 02:12:52,785
Give me the bag.

1699
02:13:01,825 --> 02:13:03,505
What's going on?

1700
02:13:04,145 --> 02:13:07,465
There has been no arrangement made.
You have been working since morning.

1701
02:13:07,545 --> 02:13:09,985
Sir, don't worry.
Everything will be done punctually.

1702
02:13:10,065 --> 02:13:11,625
Hurry up.

1703
02:13:35,905 --> 02:13:37,465
Be careful, Haldiram.

1704
02:13:37,738 --> 02:13:39,505
These are auspicious sweets.
Don't drop them.

1705
02:13:52,505 --> 02:13:54,825
Badal, what has happened? Badal.

1706
02:13:56,025 --> 02:13:58,465
Shut up.

1707
02:14:00,185 --> 02:14:02,545
No. Leave my mother.

1708
02:14:02,665 --> 02:14:04,425
Jabbar. Take the bag.

1709
02:14:04,505 --> 02:14:06,745
Don't do anything to my mother.
Leave her.

1710
02:14:06,825 --> 02:14:09,585
It won't be good.

1711
02:14:09,905 --> 02:14:11,545
Let go. Let my mother go.

1712
02:14:11,625 --> 02:14:13,865
Let him go or I'll kill her.

1713
02:14:16,665 --> 02:14:19,585
Badal.

1714
02:14:22,585 --> 02:14:23,825
Badal.

1715
02:14:50,269 --> 02:14:52,585
How do you know how to use the weapon?

1716
02:15:00,252 --> 02:15:03,132
My mother's life was in danger. So..

1717
02:15:03,252 --> 02:15:07,132
Who are you?
- You know me.

1718
02:15:07,252 --> 02:15:10,652
I want to know what
you've hidden from me.

1719
02:15:11,036 --> 02:15:12,809
You doubt me unnecessarily.

1720
02:15:15,446 --> 02:15:17,652
This bag is filled with money.

1721
02:15:18,290 --> 02:15:20,532
And the corpses are covered in blood.

1722
02:15:20,732 --> 02:15:25,492
This means that you're
not an innocent man.

1723
02:15:25,812 --> 02:15:28,012
In fact, you are a criminal.

1724
02:15:31,220 --> 02:15:33,492
And you will be punished for this.

1725
02:15:46,388 --> 02:15:48,252
Mangeyram.
- Yes, sir.

1726
02:15:48,332 --> 02:15:51,732
Until I return, keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir.

1727
02:15:52,269 --> 02:15:54,652
And nobody should be allowed to enter.
- Yes, sir.

1728
02:15:58,450 --> 02:16:00,010
Some people have been killed, too.

1729
02:16:00,570 --> 02:16:02,810
Come immediately with
the police and the ambulance.

1730
02:16:03,410 --> 02:16:05,250
I'll tell you the rest later.

1731
02:16:05,410 --> 02:16:07,410
No, aunt.

1732
02:16:09,010 --> 02:16:10,290
Move, Mangey.

1733
02:16:15,530 --> 02:16:18,010
If I had a beard and moustache,
you would've arrested me too.

1734
02:16:25,010 --> 02:16:26,170
No.

1735
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:31,170
You can't be a criminal.

1736
02:16:33,650 --> 02:16:39,850
A mother can never be wrong.

1737
02:16:42,570 --> 02:16:44,170
Tell me, son.

1738
02:16:46,250 --> 02:16:48,650
Tell me. Who are you?

1739
02:16:52,290 --> 02:16:53,410
I..

1740
02:17:30,890 --> 02:17:32,690
Do you realise what you have done?

1741
02:17:32,810 --> 02:17:35,690
I did what any mother
does for her son.

1742
02:17:35,930 --> 02:17:39,050
He is a culprit. A terrorist.

1743
02:17:39,810 --> 02:17:43,010
He is a terrorist.
- Yes, he is a terrorist.

1744
02:17:43,370 --> 02:17:45,690
If you were in his shoes and
went through what he has undergone..

1745
02:17:45,810 --> 02:17:47,730
..even you would have taken up arms.

1746
02:17:47,850 --> 02:17:50,890
You too, would have
been branded as a terrorist.

1747
02:18:29,709 --> 02:18:30,709
Scoundrel!

1748
02:18:30,829 --> 02:18:32,349
..she was my mother!

1749
02:18:32,429 --> 02:18:34,669
The one whom your
brother had targeted..

1750
02:18:34,749 --> 02:18:37,949
She was my mother! My mother!

1751
02:18:45,629 --> 02:18:47,029
A terrorist.

1752
02:18:48,909 --> 02:18:52,509
Under the law,
a terrorist is a notorious criminal.

1753
02:18:53,669 --> 02:18:56,909
And under this same law,
the person who shelters a terrorist..

1754
02:18:57,629 --> 02:18:59,709
..is a greater criminal.

1755
02:19:03,309 --> 02:19:05,829
Now you tell me, A.C.P...

1756
02:19:06,589 --> 02:19:10,309
..what should the law
do with a criminal like you?

1757
02:19:12,589 --> 02:19:13,949
D.I.G...

1758
02:19:15,109 --> 02:19:17,949
..every word of my
statement is as pure..

1759
02:19:18,029 --> 02:19:20,669
..and true, as the holy scriptures..

1760
02:19:22,695 --> 02:19:24,989
..and it is nothing but the truth.

1761
02:19:27,869 --> 02:19:29,669
If this is true..

1762
02:19:30,457 --> 02:19:35,138
..then both you and your
wife belong behind bars.

1763
02:19:39,624 --> 02:19:43,629
A.C.P., I will save you.

1764
02:19:45,069 --> 02:19:48,709
Tell me the truth.
For how much money..

1765
02:19:50,047 --> 02:19:51,749
..did your family
sell their conscience?

1766
02:19:51,928 --> 02:19:53,429
D.I.G.

1767
02:19:55,429 --> 02:19:57,989
My family can't be bought with money.

1768
02:19:58,069 --> 02:20:00,069
It can only be bought with love.

1769
02:20:04,149 --> 02:20:09,429
My wife is sure Badal
is not a born terrorist.

1770
02:20:12,269 --> 02:20:15,749
In 1984, in the Khemkaran
village of Punjab..

1771
02:20:16,789 --> 02:20:19,389
..a police officer had burnt
his mother, father and sister..

1772
02:20:19,469 --> 02:20:22,149
..along with the
rest of the villagers.

1773
02:20:23,349 --> 02:20:26,069
And that boy lost his
way and became a terrorist.

1774
02:20:29,917 --> 02:20:33,229
He didn't come to kill
innocent people of Sunder Nagar.

1775
02:20:33,582 --> 02:20:36,429
He is searching for
that police officer.

1776
02:20:41,349 --> 02:20:45,149
Oh, I see.

1777
02:20:51,869 --> 02:20:53,749
Now what do you intend to do?

1778
02:20:55,949 --> 02:20:59,469
Will you arrest that police officer
or that terrorist?

1779
02:21:00,429 --> 02:21:03,349
God will punish that police officer.

1780
02:21:04,549 --> 02:21:08,589
But I will punish
this terrorist. I will.

1781
02:21:09,109 --> 02:21:11,549
Listen to me very carefully.

1782
02:21:11,709 --> 02:21:15,309
Put up a check post at every bus
stand, railway station and highway.

1783
02:21:15,389 --> 02:21:18,749
That terrorist should not
escape at any cost, understood?

1784
02:21:18,989 --> 02:21:22,909
As soon as you see Badal, shoot him.
Shoot at sight.

1785
02:21:23,909 --> 02:21:25,709
You will kill him?

1786
02:21:26,869 --> 02:21:30,589
After all, you are a police officer.
Kill him.

1787
02:21:30,669 --> 02:21:33,829
He has betrayed me, Simran.

1788
02:21:33,989 --> 02:21:36,149
He has broken my trust.

1789
02:21:37,069 --> 02:21:40,509
Henceforth no one will
reside in my heart. No one.

1790
02:21:41,032 --> 02:21:43,949
Sister, Badal won't marry Rani?

1791
02:21:55,829 --> 02:21:57,229
Badal.

1792
02:21:59,216 --> 02:22:02,749
Not Badal. A terrorist.

1793
02:22:04,925 --> 02:22:07,469
You wanted to see a terrorist,
didn't you?

1794
02:22:09,069 --> 02:22:10,309
Look.

1795
02:22:12,309 --> 02:22:13,909
He is standing in front of you.

1796
02:22:13,989 --> 02:22:17,389
I don't understand.
What are you talking about?

1797
02:22:19,476 --> 02:22:21,909
I'm not what you think I am.

1798
02:22:23,429 --> 02:22:26,709
In the police records, my
name has been registered as Rajveer..

1799
02:22:26,973 --> 02:22:28,469
..a terrorist.

1800
02:22:31,881 --> 02:22:34,469
I came to Sunder Nagar..

1801
02:22:35,492 --> 02:22:39,709
..because I wanted to kill
the person who made me a terrorist.

1802
02:22:41,449 --> 02:22:44,829
Before the police kills me..

1803
02:22:45,860 --> 02:22:47,589
..I will kill him.

1804
02:22:49,439 --> 02:22:51,389
Forever.

1805
02:22:53,125 --> 02:22:55,949
And our love? Our life?

1806
02:22:56,195 --> 02:22:58,469
You didn't think anything about that?

1807
02:22:58,909 --> 02:23:02,709
My thoughts, my love..

1808
02:23:03,276 --> 02:23:06,189
..everything will end with my death.

1809
02:23:06,985 --> 02:23:12,269
The mission of my life is revenge.
Only revenge.

1810
02:23:12,444 --> 02:23:15,469
And what about me?
Don't I mean anything to you?

1811
02:23:15,714 --> 02:23:17,434
Why did we meet?

1812
02:23:17,714 --> 02:23:20,354
Why did we weave
all those dreams? Why?

1813
02:23:21,794 --> 02:23:24,154
This is the beginning of a war.

1814
02:23:24,477 --> 02:23:27,834
I may die anytime.

1815
02:23:29,754 --> 02:23:31,954
Your future is not entwined with mine.

1816
02:23:33,994 --> 02:23:36,234
My end is before me.

1817
02:23:37,794 --> 02:23:39,114
Stay away from me.

1818
02:24:11,274 --> 02:24:13,234
Surrender yourself to me.

1819
02:24:13,314 --> 02:24:14,554
No.

1820
02:24:15,234 --> 02:24:16,674
Not today.

1821
02:24:17,354 --> 02:24:19,314
Move away from my path..

1822
02:24:20,478 --> 02:24:22,754
..or I can do anything.

1823
02:24:22,954 --> 02:24:24,674
You will shoot?

1824
02:24:25,834 --> 02:24:27,674
Go ahead.

1825
02:24:27,954 --> 02:24:29,834
Come on. Shoot me.

1826
02:24:29,914 --> 02:24:34,914
I have no family to mourn my death.
You have a family.

1827
02:24:35,074 --> 02:24:37,255
You are a part of that family as well.

1828
02:24:37,335 --> 02:24:40,714
Don't bind me with
emotional talks, A.C.P.

1829
02:24:41,314 --> 02:24:44,514
I can still see those people burning.

1830
02:24:45,314 --> 02:24:50,954
Until I kill him,
even death can't harm me.

1831
02:25:14,154 --> 02:25:18,154
Yes, Sahab Singh.
A.C.P. has come to Kedarnath's place.

1832
02:25:18,467 --> 02:25:22,474
I don't know. But from here
he'll go directly to Circuit House.

1833
02:25:22,554 --> 02:25:26,714
Yes. D.I.G.
is staying there. Yes, sir.

1834
02:26:18,754 --> 02:26:21,194
You wanted to kill me, didn't you?

1835
02:26:23,787 --> 02:26:25,434
Now look.

1836
02:26:27,614 --> 02:26:29,394
Your life is in danger.

1837
02:26:30,306 --> 02:26:32,634
Do you want to know
why I'm still alive?

1838
02:26:33,452 --> 02:26:37,074
Because I never consider
my enemy as weak.

1839
02:26:37,689 --> 02:26:39,994
Even that day you were helpless.

1840
02:26:41,041 --> 02:26:43,863
The day I burnt your family alive.

1841
02:26:47,268 --> 02:26:49,194
Today, also, you're helpless.

1842
02:26:56,084 --> 02:26:58,834
Shoot me.

1843
02:26:59,122 --> 02:27:00,554
Shoot.

1844
02:27:22,333 --> 02:27:24,234
Brother Badal.

1845
02:27:27,489 --> 02:27:28,994
Brother.

1846
02:27:35,987 --> 02:27:39,868
No, Badal.

1847
02:27:42,430 --> 02:27:45,434
No, brother.

1848
02:27:55,132 --> 02:27:56,994
Badal.

1849
02:28:05,770 --> 02:28:09,114
Simran. Where is Simran?

1850
02:28:09,510 --> 02:28:10,914
Simran.

1851
02:28:11,500 --> 02:28:13,714
What happened?
- Simran.

1852
02:28:14,764 --> 02:28:18,394
Simran.

1853
02:28:19,262 --> 02:28:22,474
Soni. Preeti.

1854
02:28:23,857 --> 02:28:25,594
Preeti.

1855
02:28:28,742 --> 02:28:29,954
Simran.

1856
02:28:30,364 --> 02:28:32,634
What happened, Sirman? What happened?

1857
02:28:33,154 --> 02:28:35,554
Why don't you speak? Where is Soni?

1858
02:28:35,634 --> 02:28:39,634
Soni. We don't know where she is.

1859
02:28:39,714 --> 02:28:42,914
She is been missing
since this evening.

1860
02:28:43,457 --> 02:28:44,834
Scoundrel.

1861
02:28:45,834 --> 02:28:48,594
He is using the girl
to protect himself.

1862
02:28:48,674 --> 02:28:51,434
The same girl he
considered as a sister.

1863
02:28:53,394 --> 02:28:57,874
He will suffer for this.
He will suffer.

1864
02:29:01,674 --> 02:29:02,954
Brother.

1865
02:29:05,354 --> 02:29:07,314
Brother.
- No.

1866
02:29:10,214 --> 02:29:11,794
Let her go.

1867
02:29:12,625 --> 02:29:13,994
Let her go.

1868
02:29:15,685 --> 02:29:17,194
He will.

1869
02:29:18,723 --> 02:29:21,314
Only when you do a job for us.

1870
02:29:24,550 --> 02:29:28,274
Tomorrow morning you'll have to kill..

1871
02:29:30,063 --> 02:29:32,020
..our leader Satyaprakash.

1872
02:29:32,100 --> 02:29:35,554
Before that I will bury you alive.

1873
02:29:42,608 --> 02:29:51,394
If you want your sister to
be alive and get married tomorrow..

1874
02:29:52,956 --> 02:29:55,194
..then you'll do as I say.

1875
02:29:58,954 --> 02:30:01,914
Take her away.
- Brother.

1876
02:30:03,474 --> 02:30:06,354
This is the parade
ground of Sunder Nagar.

1877
02:30:07,896 --> 02:30:12,074
Tomorrow is the 15th of August.
Independence Day.

1878
02:30:12,954 --> 02:30:15,834
Tomorrow, the great leader
of our country, Satyaprakash..

1879
02:30:15,914 --> 02:30:18,874
..is going to hoist the
flag before countless people.

1880
02:30:19,842 --> 02:30:22,285
There will be tight security. But..

1881
02:30:22,365 --> 02:30:25,634
..Sahab Singh will
trick the security men..

1882
02:30:25,714 --> 02:30:28,514
..and escort you to this manhole.

1883
02:30:29,225 --> 02:30:32,354
You will get down,
and through the water tunnel..

1884
02:30:32,674 --> 02:30:34,754
..you will reach this manhole..

1885
02:30:34,987 --> 02:30:37,314
..which opens opposite the dais.

1886
02:30:37,394 --> 02:30:39,754
As soon as Satyaprakash
descends the dais..

1887
02:30:39,834 --> 02:30:42,314
..you will get out of
the manhole and shoot him.

1888
02:30:46,436 --> 02:30:51,154
And yes. Keep one thing in mind.

1889
02:30:52,188 --> 02:30:54,154
Your sister is in my custody.

1890
02:30:55,583 --> 02:31:01,114
If you try to act smart,
then she will be killed.

1891
02:31:03,820 --> 02:31:05,194
Sahab Singh.

1892
02:31:07,463 --> 02:31:10,858
Sir, do you think he
will shoot Satyaprakash?

1893
02:31:10,938 --> 02:31:14,954
Sahab Singh,
people are strange in this country.

1894
02:31:15,377 --> 02:31:19,994
They are ready to sacrifice
their lives to save their sister.

1895
02:31:20,576 --> 02:31:26,314
After he kills Satyaprakash,
we will kill him.

1896
02:31:26,804 --> 02:31:29,053
In the eyes of the government,
a terrorist will be killed.

1897
02:31:30,285 --> 02:31:32,123
And I will get another prize.

1898
02:31:42,980 --> 02:31:46,740
Today is an auspicious
day for Sunder Nagar.

1899
02:31:46,820 --> 02:31:50,900
Check every person carefully.
- Today, 15th of August..

1900
02:31:50,980 --> 02:31:53,071
..a great leader of our country..

1901
02:31:53,151 --> 02:31:56,460
..Mr. Satyaprakash
is going to come here.

1902
02:31:57,352 --> 02:32:01,114
He will unfurl the national flag.

1903
02:32:01,194 --> 02:32:05,254
As you all know, Mr. Satyaprakash..

1904
02:32:05,334 --> 02:32:08,940
..had contributed to
the freedom struggle and..

1905
02:32:09,124 --> 02:32:16,411
..he has greatly contributed
to the fight against terrorism.

1906
02:32:45,411 --> 02:32:47,651
Why did you stop?
Hurry up. We don't have the time.

1907
02:32:48,051 --> 02:32:50,451
I have enough time.

1908
02:32:55,251 --> 02:32:56,691
What do you mean?

1909
02:32:57,091 --> 02:33:00,251
Unless I don't talk to my sister..

1910
02:33:00,607 --> 02:33:04,171
..I won't kill Mr. Satyaprakash.
- Have you gone mad?

1911
02:33:04,251 --> 02:33:05,971
Let me talk to your boss.

1912
02:33:07,491 --> 02:33:09,051
Rana.
- Tell me.

1913
02:33:09,171 --> 02:33:12,091
He says he wants to talk
to his sister before going ahead.

1914
02:33:12,611 --> 02:33:14,251
Talk to your brother.

1915
02:33:16,051 --> 02:33:17,931
Brother.
- Soni.

1916
02:33:18,011 --> 02:33:20,891
Brother, save me.
- Don't worry.

1917
02:33:21,251 --> 02:33:24,811
As long as your brother is alive,
nothing can happen to you.

1918
02:33:25,191 --> 02:33:26,731
Brother.

1919
02:33:48,731 --> 02:33:52,928
Tell me! Tell me,
where have you hidden Soni? Tell me!

1920
02:33:53,008 --> 02:33:55,808
Besides Rana,
nobody knows where he is!

1921
02:33:56,078 --> 02:34:01,248
Believe me! Believe me! Believe me!

1922
02:34:04,911 --> 02:34:08,288
Ram Singh, keep a tight
watch on the north and south zone.

1923
02:34:09,488 --> 02:34:12,608
Vande Mataram
(Pledge to the motherland).

1924
02:34:12,688 --> 02:34:15,848
Vande Mataram
(Pledge to the motherland).

1925
02:34:15,928 --> 02:34:19,008
Vande Mataram
(Pledge to the motherland).

1926
02:34:19,088 --> 02:34:22,248
Vande Mataram
(Pledge to the motherland).

1927
02:34:22,328 --> 02:34:25,328
Vande Mataram
(Pledge to the motherland).

1928
02:34:25,634 --> 02:34:28,448
Vande Mataram
(Pledge to the motherland).

1929
02:34:42,688 --> 02:34:47,448
Friends, India is our country.

1930
02:34:49,288 --> 02:34:53,048
Today on the 15th of August..

1931
02:34:53,328 --> 02:34:55,728
..on our Independence Day, I promise..

1932
02:34:56,288 --> 02:35:00,368
..that I will eradicate
terrorism from this country.

1933
02:35:00,488 --> 02:35:02,248
Keep one thing in mind.

1934
02:35:02,408 --> 02:35:06,368
Terrorists are not strangers.

1935
02:35:07,368 --> 02:35:09,448
They are one of us.

1936
02:35:09,688 --> 02:35:13,728
And we should try and
make them into better people.

1937
02:35:15,768 --> 02:35:19,888
Now repeat after me. Jai Hind.
- Jai Hind (patriotic sentiment).

1938
02:35:19,968 --> 02:35:22,528
Jai Hind.

1939
02:35:22,608 --> 02:35:23,928
Jai Hind.

1940
02:35:26,008 --> 02:35:28,728
Jai Hind.

1941
02:35:28,808 --> 02:35:32,368
"Thou are the ruler of
the minds of all people."

1942
02:35:32,448 --> 02:35:35,528
"Dispenser of India's destiny."

1943
02:35:35,608 --> 02:35:39,608
"The name rises the hearts of Punjab,
Sind, Gujarat, Maratha.."

1944
02:35:39,688 --> 02:35:43,288
"..Dravid, Orissa and Bengal."

1945
02:35:43,368 --> 02:35:46,968
"It echoes in the hills of Vindhyas
and Himalayas, mingles in the.."

1946
02:35:47,048 --> 02:35:50,608
"..music of Yamuna and Ganga and
chanted by the waves of the Indian Sea."

1947
02:35:50,688 --> 02:36:01,528
"They pray for your blessing
and sing thy praise."

1948
02:36:01,728 --> 02:36:05,328
"The salvation of all
people is in thy hand,..

1949
02:36:05,408 --> 02:36:08,768
..thou dispenser of India's destiny."

1950
02:37:19,128 --> 02:37:20,808
Come, sir.

1951
02:37:25,608 --> 02:37:26,641
Move.

1952
02:37:29,712 --> 02:37:32,248
Come, sir.

1953
02:37:34,728 --> 02:37:35,968
Come.

1954
02:37:46,251 --> 02:37:50,171
What is all this?
- Death. Your death.

1955
02:37:50,251 --> 02:37:52,931
If he doesn't kill you, then I will.

1956
02:38:12,131 --> 02:38:15,131
Stop. Nobody will shoot.

1957
02:38:46,721 --> 02:38:49,241
Tell me. Where is Soni?

1958
02:38:49,961 --> 02:38:51,521
Where is my sister?

1959
02:38:53,615 --> 02:38:57,321
Tell me. Where is Soni? Tell me.

1960
02:39:14,281 --> 02:39:17,321
Where is my sister? Tell me.

1961
02:40:50,075 --> 02:40:52,281
Brother.

1962
02:41:52,289 --> 02:41:57,281
Scoundrel.

1963
02:41:59,176 --> 02:42:04,201
Stop, Badal. Stop.

1964
02:42:12,224 --> 02:42:15,161
Surrender yourself.

1965
02:42:16,203 --> 02:42:19,401
He will be punished for his deeds.

1966
02:43:12,966 --> 02:43:14,521
Soni.

1967
02:43:15,701 --> 02:43:17,521
My child.

1968
02:43:28,552 --> 02:43:30,632
Son, you have done..

1969
02:43:30,832 --> 02:43:33,312
..what a soldier of
this country would've done.

1970
02:43:33,632 --> 02:43:35,112
We are proud of you.

1971
02:43:35,392 --> 02:43:40,152
I will request the government not
to treat you as a hardcore criminal.

1972
02:44:13,512 --> 02:44:19,192
"The heart is afraid to meet those
that we might give our consent to."

1973
02:44:21,112 --> 02:44:26,712
"Don't meet me frequently.
We might fall in love."

1974
02:44:26,792 --> 02:44:31,752
"Like the cloud."

1975
02:44:31,872 --> 02:44:36,912
"The star of my heart."

1976
02:44:36,992 --> 02:44:42,312
"The twinkle of my eye."

1977
02:44:42,392 --> 02:44:47,192
"The lovelorn one is yearning."

1978
02:44:48,952 --> 02:44:53,112
"Through the eyes,
she entered your heart."

1979
02:44:53,192 --> 02:44:57,352
"Through the eyes,
she entered your heart."

1980
02:44:57,472 --> 02:45:01,472
"It took away your life."

1981
02:45:01,552 --> 02:45:05,632
"My love, my love."

1982
02:45:05,752 --> 02:45:09,912
"My love, my love."

1983
02:45:09,992 --> 02:45:13,072
"My love, my love."

1984
02:45:13,192 --> 02:45:16,352
"My companion, my sweetheart."

1985
02:45:16,748 --> 02:45:19,792
"You stole my heart, my sweetheart."

1986
02:45:20,283 --> 02:45:23,472
"My companion, my sweetheart"

1987
02:45:23,700 --> 02:45:26,752
"You stole my heart, my sweetheart."

1988
02:45:26,832 --> 02:45:28,552
"I don't want to live without you."

1989
02:45:28,759 --> 02:45:30,472
"I don't want to die without you."

1990
02:45:30,552 --> 02:45:33,432
"I swear to God."

1991
02:45:33,722 --> 02:45:37,192
"My heart sways when I see you.
My heartbeats say.."

1992
02:45:37,272 --> 02:45:40,912
"My heart sways when I see you.
My heartbeats say.."

1993
02:45:40,992 --> 02:45:44,392
"..oh young guy."

1994
02:45:44,472 --> 02:45:48,872
"I'm a young guy from Punjab.
Be my Punjabi wife."

1995
02:45:51,632 --> 02:45:55,192
"I'm a young guy from Punjab.
Be my Punjabi wife."

1996
02:45:55,272 --> 02:46:00,072
"I'll pass by your lane tomorrow.
Stand by the window, oh, love."

1997
02:46:01,312 --> 02:46:04,752
"My sweetheart took away my heart."

1998
02:46:04,945 --> 02:46:08,512
"He gave me the pain of youth."
