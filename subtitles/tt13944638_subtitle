1
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,920
'No animals or birds were harmed
during the making of this film'

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,440
All incidents and characters in this film
are fictitious, bear no resemblance

3
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:20,403
' I'm single too '

4
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,800
Uncle works here.

5
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,040
Dude, does he clean this
big building all by himself?

6
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,960
He is a famous RJ!

7
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,480
RJ is over there.
You can go and see him.

8
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,880
Nice to meet you.

9
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,000
That is him!

10
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,160
Love isn't something we go seeking.

11
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,760
It should happen by itself.

12
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,160
It should attack us...

13
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,800
turn us upside down,
and rattle us!

14
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,680
That is true love.

15
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,040
Greetings to the Tamil people in London.

16
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,240
I am your love.

17
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
Mr. Love.

18
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,600
You are listening to 99.9 Heart FM.

19
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,680
If you have any love problems,
I'll help you clear them.

20
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,600
Dude, if we get into his good books...

21
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,760
he will help us more
than what we hoped for.

22
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,000
They want to meet you.

23
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,240
He is here!

24
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,840
Just watch my performance now!

25
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,920
- Hey, you!
- Hi, Uncle.

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,520
I am Sriramakrishnan Govindanarayanan.

27
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,280
Gopalakrishnan Vishwantha
 Ramamoorthy's son.

28
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,040
How is your father doing?

29
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,920
He is doing really well!

30
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,080
So, you only told me you were coming.
Who are these people?

31
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,160
My friends.

32
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
- Oh, I see.
- Uncle, this is for you.

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,200
We are big fans of yours.

34
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,200
Yes, Uncle. I love your voice.

35
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,040
I never go to sleep at night
without hearing your voice.

36
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,920
I also wanted my voice
to sound like yours.

37
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,680
so I asked the doctor to perform
an operation, but he flatly refused!

38
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,320
You don't have to spend
all that money.

39
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,600
If you get a sore throat,
you will have my voice!

40
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
I really like your sense of humour, Uncle!

41
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,440
I never knew I had fans like you.

42
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,560
There are people in India
who are addicted to your voice.

43
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,240
The Statue of Unity in India
is the tallest statue.

44
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,280
We will erect a taller statue for you.

45
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,200
Sir, don't cry.

46
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,120
Do you love Love so much?

47
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,080
Yes.

48
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,200
I want to help you somehow.

49
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,480
Thank you, Uncle.
Let's eat and talk.

50
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,920
Let's go up and talk.

51
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,600
Love Uncle, how long
have you been in London?

52
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,480
I've been here for 20 years.

53
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,960
I got here with the money
your father gave me.

54
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,160
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.

55
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
His father doesn't give any money
to his own son!

56
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,600
How did he give Love any money?

57
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,760
He probably stole it!

58
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,960
That's a long story.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,160
Let that be. Tell me
the purpose of your visit.

60
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,720
Uncle, it's a matter of love.

61
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,120
A matter of love,
or lust?

62
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,480
Will you help either way?

63
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,720
No lust.

64
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,800
Only...

65
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,000
love.

66
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,480
Your face said otherwise!

67
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,040
It is love! It's love!
It's love.

68
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,000
Love!

69
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,280
You don't have the face
of someone who is in love.

70
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,160
Oh no!
Not me, Uncle.

71
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,440
Oh, that guy?

72
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,520
No wonder he looks like someone
who lost his passport.

73
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,600
I have united so many couples.
I will surely help you.

74
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,000
Tell me your story.

75
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,200
Uncle, drinking so early
in the day?

76
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,760
Son, how would I be able to
tolerate your stories without this?

77
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,760
Why, Uncle?

78
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,680
I'm sure your love stories
are nothing new.

79
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,160
How could you say that, Love?

80
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,080
You might have heard many love stories...

81
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,480
but never anything like ours.

82
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,440
- Who are you people?
- Who are we?

83
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,520
Even if the world opposes us...

84
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,080
even if the world humiliates us...

85
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,360
even if the world spits on our faces...

86
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,920
we would ignore everything
and continue living in style.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,480
We are the great '90s kids'.

88
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,760
The four of us aren't wastrels
like you might have thought.

89
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,200
 - No?
- We are virgin boys.

90
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,720
Our gang leader is Uday.

91
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,640
He is the Head of Singles Union.

92
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,680
We never go and pick quarrels.

93
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,320
But when they come our way,
we pick them apart!

94
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,320
When we have a problem,
Uday comes to our rescue.

95
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,680
We have come to London
only for him.

96
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,560
Only we have the rights to harass
the couples in our hood.

97
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,080
How dare you mess with them?
Take your hands off her, you runt.

98
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,720
- You dared hit our guy?
- Dude, I was just talking!

99
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Dude, beat them up!

100
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,360
What's happening?

101
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,200
A fight.

102
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,000
- I think they are fighting over you?
- Oh yes.

103
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,360
If not Trisha, then Divya!

104
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,640
Wait, I'll tell them.

105
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,560
Hi!

106
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,280
I...

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,880
love you.

108
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
Sorry, I'm already engaged.

109
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,320
Even Google has rejected our love.

110
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,800
After Uday tattooed a Nemo
for Trisha...

111
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,680
he wanted a girl like her.

112
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,840
But since he got
a Billa tattoo for Nayanthara...

113
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,040
he has wanted a girl like her.

114
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,040
Boss, it looks great.

115
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,760
I'm the one who tattooed
The Undertaker and The Rock!

116
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,320
This is nothing!

117
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,560
You are showing off
for such a lame tattoo?

118
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,800
Hit him!

119
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,920
- He should never open his mouth again.
- Guys, don't do it.

120
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,680
Uday runs a tattoo parlour...

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,440
what do you guys do?

122
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,240
Uncle, we work at Facebook.

123
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,120
- At Facebook?
- Yes, Uncle.

124
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,920
You must be big shots!

125
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,000
What do you at Facebook?

126
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,200
If we tell you,
you will slipper us!

127
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,160
I criticize movies and post reviews.

128
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,160
I criticize everything through memes.

129
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,760
I 'like' both their posts.

130
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,080
You call this a profession?

131
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,480
Yuck!

132
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,760
Come on, Uncle.

133
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,840
For engineers like us, social media
is the only source of bread and butter.

134
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Yeah, right.

135
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,160
Fine, continue the story.

136
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,760
I've always wanted to buy
a mobile with fingerprint lock.

137
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,600
Don't buy those things.
They kill the birds!

138
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,240
- You've seen the movie 2.0, right?
- This guy...

139
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,240
What you say is right.
Where is your cellphone?

140
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,560
- In my pocket.
- Careful, your birds would die too!

141
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,440
So funny!

142
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,760
This is the latest model.
Fast moving.

143
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,320
You can buy it blindly.

144
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,320
You are trying to sell us
a duplicate.

145
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,360
None of the features work!

146
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,720
I've sold thousands of phones.
This has never happened.

147
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,200
- Show me your hand.
- Why?

148
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,200
- Just show me your hand.
- Show it, dude.

149
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,160
Are you single?

150
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,400
Proudly single!

151
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,000
Then how would the fingerprint work?

152
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,040
Maybe you can unlock it
with his footprint?

153
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,000
There is a feature called face-lock
specifically for singles like you.

154
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,440
- Try that.
- Buzz off.

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,800
- What if that doesn't work?
- Nothing will!

156
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,720
Bro, step aside.

157
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,720
Sir, I got this phone only yesterday.
The fingerprint doesn't work.

158
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,240
- Show me.
- To hell with your mobile.

159
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,880
- Are you single?
- Yes, bro.

160
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,320
- Then shut it and come with us.
- Join our Union!

161
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,360
Dude, everything was done last week.

162
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll complain to your dad
if you don't stop peeping in!

163
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,320
I did it, dude!

164
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,320
What? Aren't you in 12th grade?

165
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,160
10th grade.

166
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,040
My friends think I'm already late,
and tease me for it!

167
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
Baby, combined studies?
I'm coming there.

168
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,360
Did you just hear what
that little punk said?

169
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,800
I swear...

170
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,920
if we stay single any longer...

171
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,560
They'd cancel our Aadhaar cards?

172
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,960
We have no other option
but to commit suicide.

173
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,240
Dude...

174
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,320
We are the '90s kids' who thought babies
are born when a man hugs a woman!

175
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,080
After we finished college...

176
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,160
compared to the people who humiliated us
by asking, 'Do you have a job?'

177
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
'Are you single'
'Are you still a virgin?'

178
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,040
More people have humiliated us
by asking those questions!

179
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,240
My father is a 60s kid.
Even he got committed!

180
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,680
You were born only because
your father got committed!

181
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,400
Dude, he doesn't even know the basics.
Why is he with us?

182
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,800
Dude, we will all be turning 30 soon.

183
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,320
Even if our parents
find us brides...

184
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,240
do you think they would
call us as 'dear'?

185
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,200
They will call us 'Uncle'.

186
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,400
Uncle?

187
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,800
We should find a hot chick like Nayanthara
and settle down before we hit 30!

188
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,480
Why are you laughing
like an idiot?

189
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,160
We can't even get a chick...

190
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,480
let alone a chick like Nayanthara!
You are so greedy.

191
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,840
He was just joking.

192
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,080
Ignore him.

193
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,080
You thought I was joking?

194
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,440
I am being serious here!

195
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,840
Virgin boys, single boys,
listen up everyone.

196
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,680
That would be just the 4 of us!

197
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,200
Before I turn 30...

198
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,360
I am going to find a girl like Nayanthara,
impress her, and get committed!

199
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,000
You are going to watch
this 90s kid's game!

200
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Shwetha, take off that shawl.

201
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,000
You've got nice ones!

202
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,600
This is my first time.

203
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,440
I really didn't expect you
to agree to this so easily.

204
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,800
I didn't give in.

205
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
You talked and charmed me!

206
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,840
Okay, let's get started?

207
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,040
You go first.

208
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,920
Now it's your turn.

209
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,240
No, no, no.

210
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,520
Shwetha...

211
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,920
why did you stop?

212
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
I'm shy.

213
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,800
This is nothing to be shy about.

214
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,800
Just look at me.

215
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,600
Who are these girls?

216
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,560
You blackmail my friend
with her private photos?

217
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,480
Now, I have your video.

218
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,000
Don't, woman!

219
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,600
Don't mess with me.
Do you know who I am?

220
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,240
I see who you are!

221
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,640
Your video is going to trend
all over social media today!

222
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,800
Don't!

223
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,800
You don't know me.

224
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,480
You will really regret this later.

225
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,720
No, Shwetha.
We might get into trouble.

226
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,200
He did something wrong.

227
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,360
Why should you fear?

228
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,800
Today, one can't even
trust her own husband.

229
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,040
If you trust guys like him
and go to pubs and parties...

230
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,080
they will get your photos
and blackmail you.

231
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,640
Just don't trust guys, okay?

232
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,840
She sounds like a real terror!

233
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,360
When the scene started,
I'm sure you thought otherwise!

234
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,360
Yes!

235
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,800
I was wondering why you were telling an
adult story instead of a love story...

236
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,080
but the climax was bang on!

237
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,080
Terrific!

238
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,160
Dude, all the sites have been blocked.
We are so starved.

239
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,600
I knew this would happen someday,
so I've saved 1 TB since 8th grade!

240
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,640
Start!

241
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,080
You are a 'ghilli'.

242
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,000
Oh God!

243
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,880
You fool!

244
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,760
Come.

245
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,120
Why do I see two of everything!

246
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,160
Boys, come out to eat.

247
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,440
Buddy...

248
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,320
Are you coming out or not?

249
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,760
Oh no!

250
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,200
- What is going on?
- He has a stomach ache.

251
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,360
That's why he is screaming helplessly.

252
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,880
Oh no, Daddy!

253
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,320
Is it a stomach ache
or further below?

254
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,800
I know everything.

255
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,680
I've downloaded stuff too.
I've got 2 TB!

256
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,680
Shut it and come to eat now.

257
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,040
- I'm coming.
- Okay, Uncle.

258
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,400
- That was humiliating.
- What do we do now?

259
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,600
You horny beast!

260
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,200
He is trying to steal the 1 TB.
First I will...

261
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,360
Here is the rent for this month.

262
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,360
Superb, dude.

263
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,280
Sorry, dad!

264
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,280
- Thank you, dad.
- It's okay.

265
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,400
You wanted money to setup the shop.
Now you want us to pay the rent too?

266
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,960
When are you going to become a
breadwinner for the family?

267
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,680
He will give you
after he prints them!

268
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,280
You just need 10 bucks
for bread, right?

269
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,520
No big deal!

270
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,480
Here you go.
It's a crisp new note.

271
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,520
Enjoy!

272
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,640
I'll smack you!
Being cocky?

273
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,400
If I had known you'd be
hanging out with wastrels like these...

274
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,960
I would have you Wastrel Kumar
instead of Uday Kumar!

275
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,400
Superb! Looks like this name
might catch on.

276
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,320
You've started to talk well, Mom!

277
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,960
Give it, I'll serve my son.

278
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,200
- See this?
- You saw it!

279
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,080
What's up, dude?
Idlis are heart shaped?

280
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,240
Looks like you are in a romantic
mood already.

281
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,920
All the young men in our area
are married now.

282
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,920
No one wants to marry their daughters
to you when they hear about your jobs.

283
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,800
I was hoping he would fall in love
and bring some girl home...

284
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,160
but he is adamant that he wants
a girl like Nayanthara...

285
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,400
and is running around with
wild hair like Yogi Babu.

286
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,840
He is so naive
like 'Heart' Murali.

287
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,640
I was hoping these heart shaped idlis
would make him feel some shame.

288
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,640
How was that?

289
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,440
He'd have no shame even
if you feed him a heart!

290
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,720
You guys ruin him!

291
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,400
- Shut it and eat now.
- Be respectful like that!

292
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,600
I feel it.

293
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,800
- Why are you angry?
- I feel it now.

294
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,040
You feel it?

295
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,400
If you don't get married before 30,
you can only get married at 45.

296
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,960
That's what our astrologer said.
Remember that!

297
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,640
Ask him if he has a daughter!

298
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,400
You got married at
the age of 20.

299
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,720
You don't know the pain
of getting slippered by women.

300
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,720
I did get slippered by this chick
before I managed to woo her.

301
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,400
Quit talking and get to work.

302
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,680
You call your wife a chick?

303
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,600
Yeah, I can't call her a tramp
can I? You idiot!

304
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,600
Eat up!

305
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,360
You haven't served me anything!

306
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,560
Tell her it's from the boss.

307
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,040
What's your name?

308
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,880
I'm Uday the playboy.

309
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,920
Looks like you play
games on your phone.

310
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,200
You thought I am the sort of playboy
who wears headphones and plays PUBG?

311
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,520
I pick up girls and after it is done,
I change my number and the girl.

312
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,280
I am the original playboy!

313
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,440
How many times have
you changed your number?

314
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,560
Not even once.

315
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,920
- Hi.
- Hi, I am IAS.

316
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,640
- Indian Administrative Services?
- Oh no, you got it wrong!

317
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,960
I Am Single.

318
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,160
If you are okay with it,
ready to mingle.

319
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,440
Eww!

320
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,360
Hi, XL sized Trisha.

321
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,720
By the by, my name is Neelakantan.

322
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,680
People call be Blue Bell.

323
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,920
- I love you.
- Nice name, Uncle.

324
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,120
Uncle?

325
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,240
Dude...

326
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,080
They call me 'Uncle' even
before I near them.

327
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,560
Hi, I'm Sivaramakrishnan Govindanarayanan.

328
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,640
Will you marry me?

329
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,840
When I propose marriage,
they pepper spray me!

330
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,440
Uday...

331
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,840
your father is poking fun
at us for still being single.

332
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,880
It's been 2 weeks since
we challenged him.

333
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
We are still single.

334
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,440
We've been single for 29 years now.

335
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,280
Dude, I've got an idea.

336
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,640
I'm going to call all the chicks
on my phone book and impress them.

337
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,680
Show me.

338
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,400
Look at this...

339
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,400
Grocery Girl.

340
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,520
Vegetable Woman.

341
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,320
Milk Maid.

342
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
These are the chicks
on his phone book!

343
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,440
Look at his face!

344
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,000
All the girls in our area
know us too well.

345
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,800
We need to change locations.

346
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,000
Dude, let's hit the temple?

347
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,560
And sing devotional songs?

348
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,560
- Why don't we go to the bus stop.
- Girls don't take buses these days.

349
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,320
All of them use Olas and Ubers.

350
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,040
What else can we do?

351
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,040
- How about a pub?
- They don't allow stags.

352
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,240
Dance class?

353
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,360
What for?

354
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,880
That's where we can hug girls
and learn dance, like they show on TV.

355
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,520
"Aye.."

356
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,840
"Mic Check 1... 2..."

357
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,120
"It's the girl LK?"

358
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,880
"She is a desi lady, queen of the house;
A precious woman, worth a million"

359
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,720
"Got a reputation known around the nation;
Pull the trigger, getting off, at another station"

360
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,800
"Sizzling by...
Killin' the time"

361
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,240
"Like a criminal she be
killing 'em with kind smiles"

362
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,680
"She - she be feeling fine;
You - you be outta line"

363
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,240
"Dripping words like honey;
I know ya feeling the vibe"

364
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,800
- She looks so beautiful.
- Stop looking at her that way!

365
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,960
"Signing out..."

366
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,200
When he was a kid,
he made a mistake...

367
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,400
falling from the rooftop hoping
Shakthimaan would save him.

368
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,840
His next mistake was...

369
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,240
falling in love with this girl.

370
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,200
How does love at first sight happen?

371
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,040
Love happens at first sight.
What you feel after meeting often is lust.

372
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,960
Selva sir said that.
Not me.

373
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,920
Oh, I see.

374
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,480
Dude, congratulations.
Her status shows 'single'.

375
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,560
Yay!

376
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,240
Dude, congrats.

377
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,640
Why are you over the moon
because his chick is single?

378
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,200
It is so rare to find a girl
whose status is single.

379
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,040
Even married aunties display
their status as single these days!

380
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,080
Really?

381
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,600
Hey, I'm sorry.
Let's continue!

382
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,280
- This won't work out.
- Why?

383
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,440
Even average looking chicks
have 5000 friends.

384
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,360
But she only has 48 friends.

385
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,560
Part 1 would be just about
you becoming friends with her.

386
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,280
Love and marriage would
be Part 2, Part 3 etc.

387
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,880
- This isn't going out.
- But this will, come on!

388
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,880
How? Look at that.
She only has 4 solo photos.

389
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,480
- The rest are with boys?
- That would still be fine...

390
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,560
She has posed with kids and dogs.

391
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,600
I think she does social service.

392
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,080
You will see her
pose with me now!

393
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,520
I love your optimism.

394
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,000
This isn't going to work out.

395
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,440
She will be here, right?

396
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,720
Dude, her friend put up an Instagram post
an hour ago that they'd be here.

397
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,080
They will surely come.

398
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,040
Only committed women come here.
How can we impress them?

399
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,880
Those are the only women
who would fall for you.

400
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,320
There is a trick to impress such girls.

401
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,240
What trick?

402
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,800
We aren't going to
impress ordinary girls.

403
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,120
Then what? Cheer girls?

404
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,480
We are going to impress..

405
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,240
foodie girls.

406
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,840
- What does that mean?
- You know...

407
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,720
the kind of girls who would
travel across the town for free chow!

408
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,720
Exactly!

409
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,400
When we spend our parents' money
for food, we are called free-loaders.

410
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,520
But when they do it,
they are called foodies.

411
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,880
Dude, so free-loader
means foodie?

412
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,840
Exactly!

413
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,040
Dude, your chick is here.

414
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,440
There are 4 of them,
and 4 of us.

415
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,080
Shall we impress those girls,
like they do in the movies?

416
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,320
What if we slip a fish
in their blouse, like in Veera?

417
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,280
What if they take us
to the police station?

418
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,200
Come on!

419
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,400
What if we let them walk
on our hands, like in Suryavamsam?

420
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,840
Did you see their heels?
If they step on our hands...

421
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,880
we will have a penny sized
hole in our hands.

422
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,960
My Nayanthara is here!

423
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,280
She eats a slice of pizza
and slices my heart into pieces.

424
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,440
I also write the poetry
I am going to buy white kurta

425
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,920
Hi!

426
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,760
What is your name?

427
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,760
Prabhu.

428
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,920
Very nice name.

429
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,320
Are you hungry?

430
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,320
Yes.

431
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,880
- Let's eat some pizza?
- Okay.

432
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,800
Come.

433
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,840
He is very cute, no?

434
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,760
- Is it good?
- Yes.

435
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,240
- Is that enough?
- Yes.

436
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,080
Good.

437
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,040
Wait!

438
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,120
One more...

439
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,360
Happy?

440
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,840
You can guess what happened next.

441
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,320
He did exactly what every hero
in one side love stories do.

442
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,000
That is why we are skipping
to the next interesting scene.

443
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,960
Look at the girl who is lying on
our beach like it's some vacation resort...

444
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,400
you need to tattoo her.

445
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,000
Normally foreigners like getting
tattooed in really odd places.

446
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,360
She will get the tattoo from you,
and I will get...

447
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,560
I meant I'll get
the money from her!

448
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,840
Dude, but you need to pay
me my commission.

449
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,920
[singing love song]

450
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
Hi, darling.

451
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,520
What? Darling?

452
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,080
She doesn't have a problem,
what's yours?

453
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,520
My oldest friend.

454
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,800
Hi!

455
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,640
Hi!

456
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,520
I'm Uday.

457
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,600
Manza.

458
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,560
He is the tattoo artist.
Best in town.

459
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
Take your towel off
and he'd do it.

460
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,560
Stop asking questions all the time.
Hang up now!

461
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,240
Who was that?
Your boyfriend?

462
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,160
Yeah. I am not as happy as I was,
since I got committed.

463
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,480
See!

464
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Atleast now, understand that
single life is happy life.

465
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,320
If we let men get anywhere near us,
they will ruin our lives.

466
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,440
So, why do you really hate men?

467
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,080
Maybe you are...

468
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,000
- I'll smack you!
- Sorry!

469
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,960
What, then?

470
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,800
Can't women live without men?

471
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,320
We can!

472
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,680
Then what?

473
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,160
We only have one life.

474
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,680
We should live it the way
we want to, and be happy.

475
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,720
Yes, when a husband or boyfriend
enters our lives...

476
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,440
they would place
too many restrictions on us...

477
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,000
and tell us to live the way
they think we should.

478
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,840
But they don't really care
about what we think.

479
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,840
Not all men are like that.
There are good men, too.

480
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,240
We need to have some trust.

481
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,240
Why don't you trust anyone?

482
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,480
Let me ask a simple question.

483
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,560
Is there any guarantee that the man
you marry will be with you your whole life?

484
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,120
Then why would you agree
to marry him?

485
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,600
No love.

486
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,800
No relationship.

487
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,840
No marriage.

488
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,280
No tension.

489
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,640
Oh, so a boy who wants
to get committed...

490
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,880
and a girl who wants to remain single.

491
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,680
Seems like a complicated story.

492
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,560
With a head like that,
it will seem that way!

493
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,320
Uncle, have you been in love with anyone?

494
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,920
Son,  I was...

495
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,320
deeply in love with a woman.

496
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,200
But she died.

497
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,760
No wonder she died!

498
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,120
Since her death,
I started helping other lovers.

499
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,640
Who is that woman?

500
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,000
Diana.

501
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,720
No wonder she died!

502
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,800
Sorry, Uncle.
Was I too loud?

503
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,240
Let us continue the story.

504
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,720
So, what kind of tattoo
do you like, Manza?

505
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,720
I already have my design.

506
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,480
- Oh, you have?
- Yeah.

507
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,680
Now it's easy.

508
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,200
- Look, this...
- Get her Instagram ID.

509
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,360
Dude, it is Thala's photo.

510
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,480
Even Hollywood women
like our Thala.

511
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,600
Talk to her in English and ask her
where she wants the tattoo?

512
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
Check this out.

513
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,640
On your body,
where draw?

514
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,600
Dude, you've got her thinking!

515
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,360
- Here.
- Oh, God!

516
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
No, no.

517
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,680
We always hold our Thala
close to our hearts.

518
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,400
So, we will only
tattoo your chest.

519
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,280
You might be a Thala fan.
But I'm a Thalapathy fan.

520
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,200
We hold Thalapathy
close to our hearts too.

521
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,200
Why are we fighting now?

522
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,200
Dude, you draw Thala on one side,
and Thalapathy on the other.

523
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,080
If you do that...

524
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,440
not just their fans,
all the fans will be so happy.

525
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,880
My job is to make everyone happy.

526
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,960
Hi, guys.

527
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,800
Dude, who is he?
Looks like a mixture of Hindi and English.

528
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,720
You tattoo me first,
and then my girlfriend.

529
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,000
Dude...

530
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,240
I think you can tattoo her
only if you tattoo him first.

531
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,280
This is just like those
statutory smoking warning.

532
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,280
Deal with him first,
then we can watch it all.

533
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,480
Who got this customer?

534
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,440
- Him!
- It was me.

535
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,320
- Hold this a second.
- He is good.

536
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,400
You do the tattoo.

537
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,560
- Dude, wait.
- Don't go!

538
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,000
Thought you were a professional!

539
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,680
You get to tattoo the women,
but I need to do the men?

540
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,320
Ask him what tattoo he wants.

541
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,520
What tattoo you want?

542
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,520
Snake.

543
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,560
He wants a snake.

544
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,240
Ask him where he wants it.

545
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,640
Where do you want?

546
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,520
Here!

547
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,760
Why did he strip?

548
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,760
You take care of this customer
I am leaving

549
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,600
- Dude, wait!
- Thank God! He was wearing underwear

550
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,720
A tatoo?
On your thigh?

551
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,240
Dude, he stripped everything.

552
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,960
I escaped just in the nick of time.

553
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,200
He was stripping everyting!
If I had done the tattoo...

554
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,680
he would have been dead!

555
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,600
Wait...

556
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,760
- That is Shwetha.
- Yes.

557
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,320
Dude, normally its the men
who go after the women...

558
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,000
how come they are
doing it today?

559
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,000
I told you, didn't I?
There are love waves connecting us.

560
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,440
Believe me now?

561
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,560
What are you waiting for?
Get her!

562
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,200
Yes, let's do that.

563
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,440
Who are you people?

564
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,480
- Let us go.
- Looks like a problem!

565
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,560
Let go!

566
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,760
Stop!

567
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Darling, my video didn't trend
like you said it would.

568
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,240
How many views?

569
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,480
42k, boss.

570
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,880
Just 42k!

571
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,560
So sad, right?
I expected atleast 50k.

572
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,600
I'll make sure your video...

573
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,800
gets 1 million views.

574
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,440
That is my target, woman.

575
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,800
Start camera.

576
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,080
Rolling, sir.

577
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,040
This would only get 100k views.

578
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,800
I need a million views!

579
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,360
Brother, this isn't how
you treat a girl!

580
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,160
Girls need to be...

581
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,480
treated gently, like a flower.

582
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,480
Who are you?

583
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,400
Me?

584
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,920
The name is Uday. 29 years old.
I want to get married before I turn 30.

585
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,680
- I run a tattoo shop, I'm a 90s kid...
- Stop!

586
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,560
Do you want any more details?

587
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,080
What is she to you?

588
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,240
I mean nothing to her.

589
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,920
But she means a lot to me.

590
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,400
Is it love?

591
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,360
Let me find out.

592
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,720
Yeah?

593
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,920
So it's not love?

594
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,000
Guys behave themselves
only till they get a chance.

595
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,840
He got a great chance last night...

596
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,240
wonder what all he did to you!

597
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,240
She got drenched in the rain.

598
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,080
And she got hurt too.

599
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,840
Maybe that's why he
changed her clothes.

600
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,160
What's wrong with that?

601
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,880
Whatever the circumstances, why would anyone
change the clothes of an unconscious girl?

602
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,040
Don't think everyone
acts like your boyfriend.

603
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,000
He took a big risk for her.

604
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,880
That doesn't mean
he is a good guy.

605
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,960
- Then what?
- I'll put him to the test.

606
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,400
If he passes the test,
we can trust him.

607
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,720
Why are you tensed now?

608
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,560
I thought I'd watch a bit of smut
to relieve the tension...

609
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,400
but I'm tensed because
I don't know what to watch!

610
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,320
Why don't we watch
a bit of everything?

611
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,560
That's a great idea!

612
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,000
Hurry up, let's watch something.
That one...

613
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,160
Why are they here?

614
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,200
- Hi!
- Hi...

615
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,640
I want a tattoo.

616
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,760
Sure!

617
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,840
Dudes, show our catalogues
to the catwalkers.

618
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,240
- Right away!
- Wait...

619
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,240
- They are customers!
- Just wanted to help you.

620
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,320
I already have a design in mind.

621
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,920
I'm a huge fan of Shruti Hassan.

622
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,360
Have you seen the tattoo on
her shoulder with her name?

623
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,080
I want a similar one
with my name.

624
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,160
You look like the voodoo doll
from the movie Annabelle...

625
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,520
and you're a Shruti Hassan fan?

626
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,000
We should get started or he will
impress all the chicks.

627
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,840
- Damn, didn't know it was this heavy.
- Time for me to get started.

628
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,200
Sit on this barrel.
You look like one yourself!

629
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,120
Here, have a look.

630
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,160
Hi, I'm SI.

631
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,440
SI?

632
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,680
I mean, I am single.

633
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,080
Spell your name.

634
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,080
S-U-

635
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,880
N-N-Y

636
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,000
Sunny.

637
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,640
Nice name.

638
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,640
That one?

639
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,280
That girl?

640
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,360
No, the one in pink dress.

641
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,160
That isn't a dress.
It's a body tattoo!

642
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,240
By the by,
whose fan are you?

643
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,920
I'm a fan of Trisha.

644
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,680
- Whose fan are you?
- I'm Khushboo's fan.

645
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,920
Then tattoo yourself!

646
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,800
A fan of Trisha?

647
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,000
Do you know where Trisha
has a tattoo?

648
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,600
I know.

649
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,400
She only has a small fish.

650
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,800
Come with me,
I'll give you a whale.

651
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,440
- No need.
- I can do a whale too.

652
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,000
You'd even do a whale!

653
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,000
You horny beast!

654
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,560
I'm second in command
after Uday here.

655
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,920
So talk to me.

656
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,160
Show me, I'll do it!

657
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,720
- Stupid!
- Are you going to hit me?

658
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,760
Go ahead! Atleast that way
you'd touch me.

659
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,320
So much fun annoying her!

660
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,480
Let's leave, girls.

661
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,320
Dude, we are having a lot of fun.
Come here.

662
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,520
- Wait, don't get angry.
- We do great tattoos!

663
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,280
I'll atleast do an
anchovy for free!

664
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,120
What's up?

665
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,840
I said I'll do it
but they just left.

666
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,640
Dude, they were our first
customers in six months!

667
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,040
They didn't look like they
came here to get tattoos.

668
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,000
They look like ones who steal
hair clips at a fancy store!

669
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,400
They won't get tattoos!

670
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,800
Once I pick up the needle,
I have to tattoo someone!

671
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,880
Whose phone is this?

672
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,040
Hello?

673
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,760
This is Sunny speaking.

674
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,040
When I came to get
a tattoo earlier today...

675
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,000
I forgot my phone.

676
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,360
You can collect it
from the shop.

677
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,640
There is no one else at home.

678
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,600
No one at home?

679
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,400
Can you come here
and drop it off, please?

680
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,120
Share your location on WhatsApp.
I'll be there.

681
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,320
Do you know about
one night stand?

682
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,640
One night stand?

683
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,880
You wretch!

684
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,480
- What are you doing?
- Just wait and see...

685
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,280
He will look it up on Google,
and show up here with a wide grin.

686
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,960
One night stand!

687
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,400
Apparently a man and a woman
get into a relationship for just one night.

688
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,760
They can do anything they want
on that night.

689
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,080
Next day, they go their
own respective ways.

690
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,640
This sounds great!

691
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,880
Wait, where are you going?

692
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,760
Hi, Sunny.

693
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,800
Uday?

694
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,000
Sunny had asked me
to drop off her phone.

695
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,320
I'm Sunny... the one who
spoke to you?

696
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,920
- Oh, that's you?
- There is no one at home.

697
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,880
So...

698
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,280
shall we go?

699
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,480
What?

700
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,200
Shall we go to my bedroom?

701
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,120
Sorry.

702
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,200
Why?

703
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,640
You don't like me?

704
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,200
If you'd called me some days back,
I'd have definitely come in.

705
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,240
But now I'm sincerely
in love with a woman.

706
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,760
So sorry.

707
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,360
Please give this to Sunny.

708
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:32,880
Bye!

709
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,600
When I wasn't in love,
these chances never arose...

710
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,600
but now I'm in love,
and I get these chances!

711
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,240
Why God why?

712
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,760
What happened?

713
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,440
Don't over think this.
He seems to be a good person.

714
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,880
I'm guessing he turned you down?

715
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,120
He is just a kid!

716
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,800
Forget a one night stand...

717
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,320
Just say the word...

718
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,000
I'll be standing every night.

719
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,640
Standing outside her house?

720
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,760
He isn't up for the job.
He is a 90s kid.

721
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,560
- What about you?
- I was born in 91!

722
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,840
One night stand, right?
I can stay up and work hard.

723
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,120
I'm ready.

724
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,960
I'm not greedy like them.

725
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,760
I don't need a night.
One minute is enough.

726
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,640
- Is that how long you last?
- I am ready.

727
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,240
I'm not ready.

728
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,680
After that test, the very girl
who said she hated guys...

729
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,440
became friends with Uday.

730
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,760
Uday hid his feelings
and looked at her as a friend.

731
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,960
What else could he do?

732
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,520
You know how boys are!

733
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,800
That's when that
shocking incident happened.

734
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,240
I'll tell you the occasion
for dinner later.

735
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,680
Okay?

736
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,040
8 pm.

737
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,200
Done!

738
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,320
Bye.

739
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,680
You have invited him for dinner?

740
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,480
But you don't like men at all.

741
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,160
What about your rules?

742
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,800
Uday is a good person.

743
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,920
Unlike other men, who ask you out
on dates once you get friendly...

744
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,240
he is just being
a good friend.

745
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,400
Oh wow!

746
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,560
This is the first time you are
certifying a guy's character!

747
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,720
Surprising!

748
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,000
This is the first time
I met a genuine guy.

749
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,200
He is a good man.

750
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,400
I believe he will always be one.

751
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,080
Do you like him?

752
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,600
I like him as a friend.

753
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,520
Only!

754
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,680
At this point of time,
I want to achieve in my career.

755
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,560
Darn guy, he doesn't have
any perfume.

756
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,240
He's only got empty bottles!

757
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,080
I've opened your new perfume.

758
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,400
Why is he taking so long?

759
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,880
Uday, are you coming out?
What are you doing?

760
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,640
You never use your bathroom.
Atleast let him use it!

761
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,840
There he comes.

762
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,960
Why is he walking backwards?

763
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,920
What is this?

764
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,480
How is it so huge?

765
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,080
Who were your ancestors?

766
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,400
Shut up! It became like this
after I sprayed perfume.

767
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,320
Which perfume?

768
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,360
The one hidden down
under your cupboard.

769
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,000
So you'd just spray it down under?

770
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,920
You fool! That's my father's Viagra spray.

771
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,040
Viagra? I thought it was perfume.

772
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,160
People generally spray perfume
on their shirt. Why did you...

773
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,680
spray it down there?

774
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,960
I made a mistake.
Give me some idea now.

775
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,520
Dude, it is effective for 2 hours.
Careful when you ride your bike.

776
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,280
Dude, I can't even zip my pants.

777
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,040
Shwetha is waiting for me.

778
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,560
Take off your towel.

779
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,920
Just to get an idea!

780
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,920
You get ideas only
if he takes his towel off?

781
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,120
You need to go
see your chick, don't you?

782
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,120
Absolutely!

783
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,200
Then take it off.

784
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,120
'Warning:Children, elderly and the
weak hearted should close their eyes.'

785
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,560
Yes! Yes!

786
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,360
Yes?

787
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,640
You two should take yours off now.

788
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,120
You asked him to strip first,
and now you want us to do the same?

789
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,720
You want to
take a look at all of us?

790
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,920
Don't tire me!

791
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,520
I meant, take your belts off.

792
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,560
I'm only wearing a waist thread.

793
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,760
Dude, you take your belt off.

794
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,080
Let's take our belts off
and use that spray too.

795
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,920
- Give that to me.
- It's a new belt.

796
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,320
We will see
who wins today...

797
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,560
Big brother vs little brother.

798
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,480
He is just diving in!

799
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,560
Deadpool, you are alive.

800
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,880
Uday...

801
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,720
2.0

802
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,160
I need to go.
Bye!

803
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,680
- He is leaving.
- Dude, stop!

804
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,560
Uday, hold on a second.

805
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,400
You forgot the most important weapon.

806
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,040
- What is this for?
- So that you can touch her.

807
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,680
Kiss her on pretext of tattoo

808
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,360
What are you pondering over?

809
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,800
Unlike what you think,
women don't say it blatantly.

810
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,920
They throw hints by inviting you
for lunch, dinner, supper etc.

811
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,760
We need to get the hint.
Get it?

812
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,680
Winner winner, chicken dinner.

813
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,600
- It's about time.
- Take care, dude.

814
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,160
Dude, don't miss the chance
Enjoy

815
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,960
Why did you step on my toes?

816
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,600
- Let's try out that spray.
- Let's go!

817
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:19,800
Hi!

818
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,560
Hi! Come in.

819
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,960
What's with the sudden dinner?
The setup looks great, too.

820
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,640
- What for?
- It's a surprise.

821
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,040
- Surprise?
- I'll tell you.

822
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,440
Wait for 2 minutes.

823
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,480
I'll call you when
it is ready, okay?

824
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,360
Okay.

825
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,920
Dinner in two minutes?
It has to be instant noodles!

826
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,920
This darn spray.

827
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,960
You've got clothes lying around,
like a bachelor house!

828
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,200
Head of Singles Union...

829
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,440
if she has left it lying around,
she is hinting at it.

830
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,760
Make an attempt!

831
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,480
This is her house.

832
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,960
She might leave her clothes lying around.
I shouldn't look at it!

833
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,280
But you are looking!

834
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,360
The spray is starting
 to take full effect.

835
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,360
Control!

836
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,960
Uday, ready.

837
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,360
Yes!

838
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,480
Uday...

839
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,600
Chicken!

840
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,080
Mutton!

841
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,560
This is superb.

842
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,760
It is so hot.

843
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,480
Yes, quite hot indeed.

844
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,160
How about you?

845
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,320
You drink.

846
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,840
This is superb.

847
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,960
Did you cook it?

848
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,000
Yes.

849
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,080
Whoever marries you
is one lucky man.

850
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,200
Dude, what is more important
to you? Chicken or the chick?

851
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,680
Chicken or the chick?

852
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,120
Chicken, of course.

853
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,200
Pass me that leg piece.

854
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,360
She is only changing clothes
in her own house.

855
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,840
I shouldn't look.

856
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,040
Don't look!

857
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,960
- How was the food?
- Don't ponder, pounce on her!

858
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,200
Uday?

859
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,360
How was the food?

860
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,040
I told you, it was superb.
The food was great.

861
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,400
- Why did you--
- One second.

862
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,920
You never told me
what's the occasion for dinner.

863
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,720
Wait, I'll tell you.

864
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,080
Wait?

865
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,520
If I stay here any longer,

866
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,080
it is danger!

867
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,000
That tattoo looks good.

868
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,800
This isn't a tattoo.
It's my birth mark.

869
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,400
Birth mark?

870
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,040
Don't lie.

871
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,640
Can birthmarks look like this?

872
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,560
I'm not lying, Shwetha.
I've tattooed several people...

873
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,600
but I was tattooed
by the Lord.

874
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,680
I've had no love in my life,
but he drew a heart on my hand!

875
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,600
God must be crazy, you know!

876
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,360
Can you make a tattoo on me?

877
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,880
Where have all you guys gone?

878
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,720
- Say something!
- Uday...

879
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,200
Sure!

880
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,480
Every tattoo has a meaning.

881
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,240
Similarly...

882
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,400
where you choose to get it...

883
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,960
has a meaning too.

884
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,320
Oh!

885
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,520
Is that so?

886
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,000
Oh, yes. Tattoo on the hand
means a strong person.

887
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,560
Thigh means a trendy person.

888
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,440
Ankle means a mysterious person.

889
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,000
Chest means love.

890
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,560
My favourite is the back.

891
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,760
Why?

892
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,200
Because it's easy to tattoo
a large area.

893
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,200
I was joking!

894
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,240
Back tattoos are more private because
people generally don't see them, right?

895
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,720
Where do you want your tattoo?

896
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,120
You know me well.

897
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,440
Take a guess.

898
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,600
Your hand?

899
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,520
Because you are a strong woman.

900
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,400
Wow...

901
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,200
it's nice!

902
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,600
Very nice tattoo.

903
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,000
- Son...
- Don't get excited!

904
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,800
What you think didn't happen.

905
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,480
She swore at him so bad,
it got censored out!

906
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,320
Dude, I made a big mistake.

907
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,800
Listen to me carefully.

908
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,640
Don't go near her house
for the next 4 to 5 days.

909
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,000
She might file a case
out of anger.

910
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,960
Dude, what he says is right.

911
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,520
Think and make a decision.

912
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,960
All thanks to your father!

913
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,680
See what has happened because he
left the spray in your bathroom.

914
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,760
We should be a little patient.

915
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,880
I couldn't reach Shwetha's mobile phone.

916
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,320
- She left for the UK.
- What is UK?

917
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,400
London.

918
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,760
- When will she back?
- Maybe 2 to 3 years.

919
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,880
Bye.

920
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,600
Dude...

921
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,080
Why are you sad now?
There are other girls.

922
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,600
We are playboys!

923
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,400
You should have found
another girl by now!

924
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,680
Shut up, Four Eyes!
We are talking, right?

925
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,600
She left the town
because of me.

926
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,240
She must be suffering alone.

927
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,160
Shall I go to London too?

928
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,080
London?

929
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,320
Dude, you are 100 percent right.

930
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,640
In a way, we are responsible
for this mess too.

931
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,640
I'm the only one responsible.

932
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,520
Fine, but this isn't a Gautham Menon movie.
Going abroad isn't easy!

933
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,920
Yeah, you take care of the shop.
The three of us will go.

934
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,280
I want to come too!

935
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,320
We need to arrange money.
We need a plan.

936
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,600
Guys, going to London
isn't complicated.

937
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,760
What are you blabbering?

938
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,720
Two way tickets
cost 50,000 per head.

939
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,000
All of us can go
if we have 2 lakhs.

940
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,920
I just borrowed money
to open this shop.

941
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,920
- How much did you borrow?
- Two lakhs, dude.

942
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,880
Two lakhs?

943
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,080
Two lakhs!

944
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,280
We are going to London!

945
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,600
- To arrange for the tickets...
- I'll be back.

946
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,280
Where is he going?

947
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,280
It's just that...

948
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,680
he set-up this shop with his
father's hard earned money...

949
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,600
so he wants to look at it
one last time.

950
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,240
- He is a good guy.
- He is.

951
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,000
What is he holding?

952
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,760
We have money only for 4 tickets,
why are you taking her along?

953
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,680
Looks like he is leaving
one of us behind.

954
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,880
Dude, wait for me!

955
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,200
This is how we came to London, Love.

956
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,160
Uncle, you need to
unite him with his love.

957
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,240
Son...

958
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,880
Even if James Bond
comes against us...

959
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,160
I will unite you
with your love.

960
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,480
Singles...

961
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,600
take a leak
and be back soon.

962
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,880
You are going to watch
the real game now.

963
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,520
Wow, what a beautiful city!

964
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,240
Very nice.

965
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,120
- Look here.
- What are you looking at?

966
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,200
Dude, everything looks
bigger through this.

967
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,520
I know what you
are looking at...

968
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,120
put it away, you pervert!

969
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,680
I meant the building.

970
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,680
So, he is still the pervert then!

971
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,400
His father is calling.
Put the phone away.

972
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,320
Dude, use this phone.
That one is out of battery.

973
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,120
Superb!

974
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,640
Uncle is here.

975
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,240
- LKB...
- Son.

976
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,440
The company the girl works at
has 12 branches in London.

977
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:10,320
Looks like before you can locate her,
your visas will expire!

978
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,720
This isn't hard!

979
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,440
If we split up and search,
we will locate her in 4 days!

980
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,080
- This isn't new to us.
- Yeah, simple!

981
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,200
How do you hang out
with such guys?

982
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,200
Uncle, they need to
see each other.

983
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,760
Talk to each other.
And get together.

984
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,800
Move away!
You think you are Mani Ratnam?

985
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,840
Uncle, we'd do anything
for his love.

986
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,880
Oh?

987
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,120
Then go and look for her.

988
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,760
Give us some money then!

989
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:18,320
"As the evening rain pours on us;
Thus began a thousand melodies"

990
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:28,160
"The youth always craves beauty;
I need you, to live this life"

991
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:37,000
"Will your heart be considerate,
And accept my love?"

992
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:46,200
"As your hair sways with the wind;
Does it write my name?"

993
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:55,560
"You brought life into my dreary world;
With the colour of your cheeks"

994
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:05,800
"You recited a poem sans language;
without saying a word at all!"

995
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:18,880
"As the evening rain pours on us;
Thus began a thousand melodies"

996
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:28,040
"The youth always craves beauty;
I need you, to live this life"

997
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:42,840
"O lotus, even if you go across the world;
I will travel the seven seas for you."

998
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:51,520
"I don't care who you are in your next birth;
I want to live my seven lives with you!"

999
01:00:51,560 --> 01:01:00,360
"The breeze that surrounds me,
Is getting nice and cold"

1000
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:10,040
"When I inhale, my breath...
It is filled with your scent"

1001
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:19,480
"You brought life into my dreary world;
With the colour of your cheeks"

1002
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:28,880
"You recited a poem sans language;
without saying a word at all!"

1003
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:45,720
"O love, like the endless grapevines;
Our love is intertwined forever"

1004
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:54,480
"Like the lone cloud that just vanishes;
My love is changing, too."

1005
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:03,160
"Before I finish this song;
Give me your answer"

1006
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:13,080
"Many songs in the movies ;
They evoke a lot of sadness"

1007
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:22,400
"You brought life into my dreary world;
With the colour of your cheeks"

1008
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:31,720
"You recited a poem sans language;
without saying a word at all!"

1009
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:45,680
"As the evening rain pours on us;
Thus began a thousand melodies"

1010
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:54,880
"The youth always craves beauty;
I need you, to live this life"

1011
01:02:55,880 --> 01:03:04,240
"Will your heart be considerate,
And accept my love?"

1012
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:13,520
"As your hair sways with the wind;
Does it write my name?"

1013
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,160
Shwetha!

1014
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,320
Here!

1015
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,000
So... new job, new boss...

1016
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,160
how is it?

1017
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,760
New job...

1018
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,520
yes!

1019
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,600
New boss...

1020
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,800
okay!

1021
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,560
Does he torture you?

1022
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,760
A little.

1023
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,200
What happened?

1024
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,440
I got a message
requesting for blood donation.

1025
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,720
So... hey, what are you thinking about?

1026
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,800
My blood group is AB-

1027
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:34,760
Okay...

1028
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,320
And, it's a rare blood group.

1029
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,520
- Fine!
- I think I should donate.

1030
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,640
Okay, my time is up.
I should go.

1031
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,160
- You go ahead, okay?
- Okay.

1032
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,840
See you soon!
You have a really good heart.

1033
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,240
- Thanks!
- Bye.

1034
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,400
Bye.

1035
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,520
Uday?

1036
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,480
You should thank her.

1037
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,040
She is the one who donated
her blood at the right time.

1038
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,040
Thanks a lot, Shwetha.

1039
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,760
He lost a lot of blood
as his blood vessels were cut.

1040
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,880
It is sutured now...

1041
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,880
and, because of your timely blood,
you have saved him.

1042
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,520
Thank God!

1043
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,880
But we need to keep
him in observation...

1044
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,040
to rule out the head injury
as he fell down on his head.

1045
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,000
Only one person
is allowed to be here.

1046
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,560
Others, please leave.

1047
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,120
Sure.

1048
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,720
What are you doing here?

1049
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,200
He came here to see you.

1050
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,960
And look what happened!

1051
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,000
The doctor says he will be okay...

1052
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,920
that's enough for us!

1053
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,240
He came here saying...

1054
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,640
"I did something wrong,
so I have to see her."

1055
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,360
He never took anything
in his life seriously.

1056
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,880
The only thing he was
serious about was you.

1057
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:57,240
My friend loves his parents.

1058
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,800
He would do anything for them.

1059
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,040
But he left his parents...

1060
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:07,120
and came to this strange country
where he didn't know anyone or anything.

1061
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,520
What do you think is the reason?

1062
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,080
His love for you.

1063
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,760
Please understand his love.

1064
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:16,480
What would you have done
if something serious had happened to him?

1065
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,040
Did you even think about his family?

1066
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,520
We are his friends.

1067
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,160
We would give our lives for him.

1068
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,680
Listen...

1069
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,560
take him home safely.

1070
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Please!

1071
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,880
And if you need anything,
please take my number.

1072
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,200
Take care.

1073
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,440
Dude! Uday is okay.

1074
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,800
Come in and see him.

1075
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,120
I'm not coming.
Go away!

1076
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,360
He is better now.

1077
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,880
Why are you crying?

1078
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,560
I swear, he is okay now.

1079
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,360
Dude, just come in and look
at him once.

1080
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,640
As a kid, I used to...

1081
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:07,840
You meatball!

1082
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,240
He is fine now,
and she looks real fine.

1083
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,520
Can't I look at her?

1084
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,760
Hey! Can't I look you?

1085
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:22,680
"Tell your proposal before this song endl"

1086
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:35,400
"Many songs in appear in screening
it will be trouble is to so?"

1087
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,920
What's he doing?

1088
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,200
He is going to propose.

1089
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,600
What is the punishment
for eve teasing in this country?

1090
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,920
They'll make sure you
can't do anything anymore!

1091
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,040
Hi, Shwetha.

1092
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,760
The girl is here!

1093
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,840
I came to apologize to you,
but now I need to thank you.

1094
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,280
Thank you.

1095
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,360
The boys told me you donated your
blood at the right time and saved me.

1096
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,440
Listen, Uday...

1097
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:14,720
...that was an accident.

1098
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,880
I donated my blood
to you by accident.

1099
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,480
You didn't know
it was for me?

1100
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,240
There are love waves connecting us.

1101
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,760
That's why this happened.

1102
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,720
Do you watch too many movies?

1103
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:29,320
You thought if you follow me to
another country and say these dialogues...

1104
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,400
I'll fall in love?

1105
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,560
You won't?

1106
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,640
GVM...

1107
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,120
I watched your movies for nothing?

1108
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,720
Would anyone come like this
to see a girl?

1109
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,560
I'd come for you, Shwetha.

1110
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,560
What if something had
happened to you?

1111
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,080
Did you even think about your parents?

1112
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,360
You are a good hearted woman.

1113
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:51,320
I'd do anything to give them
a good daughter-in-law like you!

1114
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,560
I really trusted you.

1115
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,000
But you broke my trust.

1116
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,360
Then you should have just gone.
I'd have been gone too.

1117
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,600
Why did you save me?

1118
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:07,000
I gave you a treat that day
because I was leaving for London.

1119
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,520
But what did you do?

1120
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,160
This won't work for me, Uday.

1121
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,720
Shwetha, I'm not just fooling around.
I'm serious about you.

1122
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,160
I want you to be with me all the time.
We should be happily married like my parents.

1123
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,760
Those are your feelings.

1124
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,160
And I'm not saying it's wrong.

1125
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,840
But why aren't you trying
to understand my feelings?

1126
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,840
I'm not interested in love or marriage.

1127
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,160
The only thing important
to me is my career.

1128
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,720
Do you know how hard I worked
to get here?

1129
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,760
I'm soon going to
be a Project Leader.

1130
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,040
This is my dream!

1131
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,760
My dream, my love, my life...
everything is you, Shwetha.

1132
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,640
I thought you would
be a good friend.

1133
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,880
But you behaved like
an average man would.

1134
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,360
What would make you
like me?

1135
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,880
I like you.

1136
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,200
But I don't like love.

1137
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,240
So you won't like me
if I say I love you?

1138
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,320
Friends?

1139
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,040
She doesn't like love, Love.

1140
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,240
Me?

1141
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,640
I meant this love.

1142
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,600
Love, is there anyone
who doesn't like love?

1143
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,160
Is she being difficult?

1144
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,280
She only said she doesn't like love.
She never said she doesn't like you!

1145
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,600
Then what's the problem?
Make an attempt.

1146
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,720
Dude, this is just a small problem.

1147
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,320
Don't make a face like
you failed your 12th grades.

1148
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,880
Failure is the...

1149
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:39,680
what is it?

1150
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,760
Doesn't matter if you
get the proverb wrong when drunk.

1151
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,040
You are right!

1152
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,200
These women who talk feminism
are actually weak on the inside.

1153
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:49,080
But they just pretend
to be really tough people!

1154
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,080
Don't fret over it,
she will come around.

1155
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,320
Dude, I'm not saying this because
you got me London booze...

1156
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,920
she really likes you.

1157
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:59,160
But she isn't accepting your love
because she wants to play it cool.

1158
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,440
You need to bring that love
out of her!

1159
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,880
You 90s kids...

1160
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,760
when will you get committed?

1161
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,120
It's not like
we are saying no.

1162
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,640
They are saying 'no'to us!

1163
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,200
90s kids are the ones who
only depend on their own hands.

1164
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,760
We will get committed soon!

1165
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,200
Uday, I say this out of
my personal experience...

1166
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,200
I know how hard it is
to live alone.

1167
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,480
I have money.

1168
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,640
I have all the comforts.

1169
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,280
But I have no life.

1170
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,480
That's why I help lovers like you.

1171
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,040
But Uday, that girl is your life!

1172
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:36,480
Don't give up!

1173
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,320
- Come on, boys.
- Looks superb!

1174
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,520
- How is my home?
- Looks superb!

1175
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,320
- This is your house?
- Yes.

1176
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,280
It is all shiny, like your head.

1177
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,200
Funny guy.

1178
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,240
Who is this really old man
posing in this photo?

1179
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,560
I am Love Guru,
but he is my guru.

1180
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,680
Touch and pray to him.

1181
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:07,080
- Playboy guru.
- Can I touch her?

1182
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,400
Enjoy yourself!

1183
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,720
God, I want to be born
as his son in my next birth.

1184
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,000
You'd still do nothing!

1185
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:16,320
Sir, if this is your house,
what about the other one?

1186
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,280
- That is mine, too.
- What are you saying?

1187
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,760
Are you doing some smuggling
business in London?

1188
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,480
Son, you don't know
how influential I am in London.

1189
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,600
You will get to know eventually!

1190
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:28,400
Did you buy this big house
by working in the radio station?

1191
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,600
You shouldn't ask me.
It's illegal.

1192
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,160
- I'll take a selfie with him.
- Enjoy!

1193
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,600
Do those girls come here?

1194
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,160
Wait and see.

1195
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,520
Feelings, huh?

1196
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:48,720
Uday...

1197
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,640
the most difficult thing on earth
is securing a place in a girl's heart.

1198
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,600
You need to work hard for it!

1199
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,800
Come, I have a surprise for you.

1200
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,760
Come on!

1201
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,160
What, Love?

1202
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,640
Wait and watch.

1203
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,160
Love, this is superb!

1204
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,720
- You are the best!
- Don't drop me!

1205
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,040
Don't kill him
He is only one for our support

1206
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:36,880
Thank you.
Love you!

1207
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:37,760
Dai! What happend?

1208
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,320
Yes!

1209
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,360
This is the right sweater
for this cold!

1210
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:59,280
You haven't just showed him the way.
You thought about us, too!

1211
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,760
You are truly
a love guru.

1212
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,520
This is a surprise for me too!

1213
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,040
She looks like a delicious sweet.

1214
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,840
Careful, the syrup might ooze out.

1215
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,480
Wow, this is great!

1216
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,120
I call dibs on that milkshake!

1217
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,280
Do you know Uday has moved in
to the house across the hall?

1218
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,000
So what?
We are just friends now.

1219
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:25,040
You are friends?

1220
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,280
You two are still friends
after everything that happened?

1221
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:29,760
How?

1222
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,560
Yes we can.
He told me!

1223
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,000
Maybe he told you.
But still...

1224
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,840
Do you think he will let you go?

1225
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,880
Do you think he will just
leave after you become friends?

1226
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,680
I'm telling you, he isn't going to
leave without you.

1227
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,240
Let's see?

1228
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:45,760
Okay, let's see.

1229
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:46,720
Okay!

1230
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,200
- Hi!
- Hi.

1231
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,560
Hello.

1232
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,240
This is Uday.
My friend.

1233
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:24,840
You ordered it?

1234
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,480
Thank you!

1235
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,280
Hi, Mia!

1236
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,480
I am Sivaramakrishnan
Govindanarayanan.

1237
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,280
I come from a very orthodox family.

1238
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,360
My dear Mia...

1239
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,040
try me, we'd make a great pair.

1240
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,480
In your heart,
I'll secure a place.

1241
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,720
In my town,
I'll build you a palace.

1242
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,600
After we marry,
I'll show you...

1243
01:16:58,720 --> 01:16:59,800
how much I care.

1244
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:01,680
My dear Mia...

1245
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,680
If God granted me one wish...

1246
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,360
I'd only ask him for one thing.

1247
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,480
Please turn me into a cat.

1248
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,720
Because, the only word that
would come out of my mouth would be...

1249
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:14,560
Mia! Mia!

1250
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,720
Wow!

1251
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:16,720
This is superb.

1252
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,360
Dude, I need to pick up
some chick before we leave.

1253
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,080
I only want Mia.

1254
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,200
- Mia?
- I need to impress her!

1255
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,200
- Is he thinking the same thing?
- She is mine!

1256
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,560
- Let's see.
- Wait for me.

1257
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,680
Yes?

1258
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,760
Here I come.

1259
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,040
Hi!

1260
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:36,880
Hi.

1261
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,200
- Hi!
- Hi.

1262
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,200
Hi!

1263
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,080
I'm Tamil, too.

1264
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,000
Oh?

1265
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,480
Superb!

1266
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,400
Superb, superb.

1267
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,880
Superb! Superb! Superb!

1268
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,120
Come in.

1269
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,760
Thank you, guys.

1270
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,840
I heard you live across the hall...

1271
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,600
you speak Tamil too.

1272
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,440
So I brought a box of sweets
to start a friendship.

1273
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,800
- I don't want to be friends!
- Just take it, dude.

1274
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,120
Okay!

1275
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,000
See you guys.

1276
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:11,160
Bye, guys.

1277
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,160
Bye, guys.
I'll see you.

1278
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,120
Turn around and leave.
I'll see you!

1279
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,440
She looks like melted butter!

1280
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,520
Oh Mia...

1281
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,240
Bye!

1282
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,600
Cheers!

1283
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,880
Dude, there are 4 of them.
One for each, but two for me. Okay?

1284
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,720
Dude, three of them look hot.

1285
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,720
But one of them
is all covered and quiet!

1286
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,520
What are you hiding from us?

1287
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,520
Son, sit!

1288
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,240
- Sorry, Guru.
- Forgive us!

1289
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:00,120
You kept your word and got all
those girls from the photo?

1290
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,320
I only do what I say.

1291
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,360
And say what I do.

1292
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,880
Just tell us what to do,
we'd do it ourselves.

1293
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,400
- I'll tell you.
- Yes, sir...

1294
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,280
Every morsel of food you eat
after satiating your hunger...

1295
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,560
belongs to someone else.

1296
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,480
- Guru, I have a doubt.
- Ask me.

1297
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,160
Guru, what should we do
for girls to like us?

1298
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,640
Every girl likes something different.

1299
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,520
If we do the things they like
the way they like it...

1300
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,680
they will like us!

1301
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:30,400
Talk without touching them.
We are feeling bitter!

1302
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:33,840
If you can, use your talents
and impress the girls.

1303
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,320
I'll go meet Uday.
Bye.

1304
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,200
What do you like?

1305
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,640
I like dance!

1306
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,200
Oh darn!

1307
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,640
What do you like basically?

1308
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,440
I like acting.

1309
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:48,720
Yeah?

1310
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,440
I'm a professional actor.

1311
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:52,200
I will perform.

1312
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,280
She isn't interested in love.
She only wants to be friends.

1313
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,040
Uday, when you confess
your love to girls...

1314
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,720
...they'd initially turn you down.

1315
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:03,360
Meanwhile, they would test the boy.

1316
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:06,800
The one who passes the test
gets the girl.

1317
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,920
How do I pass the test?

1318
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,320
You need to wait.

1319
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,600
You need to wait?

1320
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,200
- Come, that's enough.
- Let me finish!

1321
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,360
- You are jealous of me.
- Buddy, it's your turn.

1322
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,360
- I don't have any talent!
- Why are you crying?

1323
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,640
Which girl would like
boys like me?

1324
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:25,800
I'm scared of hitting on women.

1325
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,280
It will happen only if
they make the first move!

1326
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,720
Don't cry, dude

1327
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,120
Why is he crying?

1328
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,400
He has cancer.
It was confirmed last night.

1329
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,080
Dude, I told her.

1330
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,120
Hello?

1331
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,240
Hi, sir.

1332
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,320
Yeah.

1333
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,000
Okay...

1334
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,040
Okay... yeah, that's the pass-code.

1335
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:51,920
Got it. Thank you.

1336
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,680
Come on, babe.

1337
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,520
Don't stress out.
It's going to be fine.

1338
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,360
Relax!

1339
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,640
You have no idea!

1340
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,280
I have to get this done
by the end of the day.

1341
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:06,760
The tattoo looks great.
Where did you get it?

1342
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:08,880
What do you care?

1343
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,160
It was Uday, right?

1344
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:12,880
So what?

1345
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:15,680
I've been wanting to get
a tattoo for a while now.

1346
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,120
That's why I asked!

1347
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,200
Where should I get it?

1348
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,280
On my hands?

1349
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,600
Thighs?

1350
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:29,600
Hips?

1351
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,200
On my chest?

1352
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,600
I'm confused.
I'll ask him!

1353
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,520
Don't get a tattoo from him!

1354
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,320
- Why?
- He isn't good.

1355
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:41,600
Your tattoo looks good.

1356
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,280
Mia, listen to me.

1357
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,320
He is a little weird.

1358
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,320
Oh, is he naughty?

1359
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,520
I like naughty boys.
It's okay!

1360
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,640
Hi, Uday.
How are you?

1361
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:00,120
- I'm good. How are you?
- I'm okay. Fine!

1362
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:03,080
You live with Shwetha, right?
You could tell her good things about me!

1363
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,160
Forget Shwetha.
You tell me about yourself.

1364
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,520
Half the film is done,
and you want me to start over?

1365
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:10,520
I'm in London to fulfil my challenge
of falling in love and getting married.

1366
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,880
I'm a true 90s kid!

1367
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,200
Oh okay. 90s kid, huh?

1368
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:15,640
Hey, nice arms.

1369
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,240
You should leave now.

1370
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,560
Leave?

1371
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,720
Uday, just like the tattoo
you did on Shwetha's hand...

1372
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,040
do a tattoo on me,
and I'd leave.

1373
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,680
No way. Leave now.

1374
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:30,360
You tattooed her hand,
where are you going to tattoo me?

1375
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:31,760
On my legs?

1376
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:33,800
Chest?

1377
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,000
Hip?

1378
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,080
I'm not leaving
unless you tattoo me.

1379
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,720
I'm a lover boy, not a playboy.

1380
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:39,720
Listen to me, leave.

1381
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,040
Is that so?

1382
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:45,480
Look here, Uday...

1383
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,800
If you don't tattoo me now...

1384
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,000
I'll tell the police
you molested me.

1385
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,000
Police?

1386
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,440
I've reported several people
to the police.

1387
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,760
Think about it.
The decision is yours.

1388
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,400
At home, I'd get away
with 100 rupees.

1389
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,920
These people will ask
for a 100 pounds!

1390
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,680
Mia, you got a package from Amazon.

1391
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,520
I'm doing something amazing now!

1392
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,760
Hang up now!

1393
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,560
I'm sure he didn't tattoo you.

1394
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,320
How is it?

1395
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,080
Don't miss out on a single video.
We will use this to show off at home!

1396
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:27,880
Shwetha isn't answering my calls.

1397
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,160
Try again!

1398
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,240
I said try to reach her,
but you are taking selfies?

1399
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,200
- Sorry, dude.
- I'll try calling Mia.

1400
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,040
Hello, Shwetha.

1401
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:41,760
Hi, sir.

1402
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,760
- How is it with the project?
- Everything is good.

1403
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:45,680
- So far so good?
- Yes, sir.

1404
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:47,200
- There are no problems?
- No.

1405
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:48,120
That's great.

1406
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,040
Here is the device.
Update the project.

1407
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,040
Keep it with you carefully.

1408
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,840
At 10 am, we need to log in.

1409
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,240
- Alright.
- I will join you guys shortly.

1410
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,440
- Okay, great.
- Thank you.

1411
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,720
- Update the project. Don't forget!
- Yes. Thank you, sir.

1412
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,360
Okay?

1413
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,440
Listen Uday... Shwetha is
super busy today.

1414
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,720
- Superb!
- Busy, right?

1415
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,680
Yes, right.

1416
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:13,280
- She has a project bid at 10 am.
- Wait for me!

1417
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,160
It's very important.

1418
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:18,200
I can't assure you that
she will come out.

1419
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:20,560
But just wait, okay?
I'll try my best.

1420
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:22,720
Okay.

1421
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:23,760
Thank you, sir.

1422
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,480
We only have a few days
left before our visas expire.

1423
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:28,560
You need to impress
her before that.

1424
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,600
Or the whole London trip
would go to a waste.

1425
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,880
I'm talking to you!
Where are you going?

1426
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:33,920
I'll be back.

1427
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,880
Yes, sir.

1428
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,040
Great! Okay, bye.

1429
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:45,640
What happened?

1430
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,800
Don't stress out.
Come on, let's go out for coffee.

1431
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,840
No need!

1432
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,880
I only have half an hour to login.

1433
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,240
Come on, it only takes 5 minutes.
Let's go!

1434
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,120
Please, let's go!

1435
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:57,560
- Come, come, come.
- Okay!

1436
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:10,160
We are going to get the project.
Don't stress yourself, okay?

1437
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,000
What do you want?

1438
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,720
Dude, the girls are here.
Where did he go?

1439
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,800
We are trapped here!
What do we do now?

1440
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,640
All of you hide your faces.

1441
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:18,760
Hide it properly!

1442
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,560
Hi, Shwetha!

1443
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,600
Uday?

1444
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:27,760
- What are you doing here?
- Came here to see you.

1445
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,560
Uday, there is a limit for everything.

1446
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,600
Don't disturb me
at my work place.

1447
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,560
I need to meet my friends often.

1448
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,240
That's why I came to
give you this bouquet...

1449
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,640
...and wish you.

1450
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,560
Do you know how
important today is?

1451
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,160
Come!

1452
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,800
I came for wish only
not proposal

1453
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,000
She is tensed
because of her project.

1454
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,040
Try to understand her, Uday.

1455
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:54,120
See you.

1456
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:03,960
Shwetha, where did you go?

1457
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:05,880
I was just submitting
the final report, sir.

1458
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:07,160
It's okay.

1459
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,040
Just put the device.
We have 10 minutes only.

1460
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:09,880
Yes, sir.

1461
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,160
Shwetha, what happened?
Where is the device?

1462
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,720
- You have the device, right?
- Yes, sir.

1463
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,720
Maybe I left it in my cabin.
Can I go check?

1464
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:19,720
Go, quick!

1465
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,320
Dude, she rejected you and threw
the flowers away. Let's leave.

1466
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,640
I'll tell her I'm leaving.

1467
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:37,080
She threw those flowers
because she wanted you to leave.

1468
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,240
Shwetha, where is the device?

1469
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,000
We have 2 minute to login.

1470
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,280
Sir, it is missing.

1471
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,880
What do you mean it's missing?
We can't bid the project without the device.

1472
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,080
I know sir...
but I can't find it, sir.

1473
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,720
What do you mean it's missing?

1474
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,880
I don't know, sir.
I can't find it.

1475
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:00,480
I'm sorry, sir.

1476
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,480
I'm so sorry.

1477
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:02,880
You idiot!

1478
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,480
Please mind your words, sir.

1479
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,920
How dare you raise your
voice against me?

1480
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:13,440
Get out of my office.

1481
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,200
Oh shit!

1482
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,520
Uday, what are you doing here?

1483
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:19,560
- Uday, leave this place.
- Who are you, man?

1484
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:21,800
Uday, this is my problem.

1485
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,600
- I'll solve this, please leave.
- He is going overboard.

1486
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:24,600
I'm here for you!

1487
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:26,920
Don't interfere in this.
This is my problem.

1488
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,080
Get out of here.

1489
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,600
Shwetha, don't hate Uday.

1490
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,400
He is a poor guy.

1491
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,080
I lost my job, Mia.

1492
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:55,800
Do you understand that?

1493
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,280
I lost my job.

1494
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,320
He ruined my career.

1495
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,600
What did he do?

1496
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,320
You lost the login device!

1497
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:07,280
The device must have fallen out of
my purse when I threw away his flowers

1498
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:08,880
You don't get it.

1499
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:12,200
He cares about you and loves you
more than you love yourself.

1500
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,480
Shwetha, one second.
Look here.

1501
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,280
- Please, Shwetha. Look here.
- What?

1502
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,360
Look.

1503
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:21,560
See...

1504
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,920
He tattooed 'sister' on me.

1505
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:27,040
It doesn't matter.

1506
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:28,720
Okay, look! His friends
told me...

1507
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:31,320
you'd understand him
if we make you feel possessive.

1508
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:32,880
That is why we did this.

1509
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:34,840
Please try to understand, Shwetha.

1510
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:38,120
You won't find a better guy.

1511
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,560
I know that he will definitely
take good care of you.

1512
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,640
I don't care.

1513
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,160
Bye, Mia.

1514
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,520
Shwetha, you are fooling yourself.

1515
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:48,240
That's okay.
Bye!

1516
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,920
I treated you like my own sons.

1517
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,920
He didn't tell us,
but atleast you could have!

1518
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,920
My son must have suffered
a lot in London.

1519
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,520
- It was just--
- Don't say anything!

1520
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,840
He didn't go to the next town.

1521
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,560
He crossed the seas
and went to London!

1522
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,440
The astrologer said water
is dangerous to him!

1523
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:12,520
He meant something else!

1524
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,560
No wonder he met with an accident.

1525
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,280
If something worse had happened,
who would have taken responsibility?

1526
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:18,640
I should fall at his feet!

1527
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,320
She seems furious.
How about you?

1528
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,200
Cool!

1529
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,000
Then let's have a couple of beers?

1530
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,920
If you call all the shots,
what are we here for?

1531
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,160
Why don't you arrange his wedding too?

1532
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,320
Right from our school days,
to getting jobs...

1533
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,760
you two have helped
us with everything.

1534
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:39,440
So we thought we could atleast try to
help him with finding the bride...

1535
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,720
but it didn't work
so we came back.

1536
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,160
You were the one who urged him
to get married before 30.

1537
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,840
So he stopped hanging out with us,
and started hanging out with that girl.

1538
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:50,040
Now you are blaming us!

1539
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,080
Why are you putting the
ball in my court?

1540
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:53,880
Don't play the blame game now!

1541
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,480
Just talk it out
and fix his marriage.

1542
01:31:56,160 --> 01:32:01,000
Like every other parent,
I wish to get my son married too.

1543
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,680
I don't think it's beneath my prestige
to talk to the girl.

1544
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,680
But what do you
guys do these days?

1545
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:08,560
You fall in love through Facebook,
and break up over WhatsApp.

1546
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:10,840
How can I take your word
and go to see her?

1547
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,560
Girls these days place demands like...

1548
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:13,640
"I want a helicopter."

1549
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:14,680
"I want an aeroplane."

1550
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:17,440
"I want a groom with
a monthly salary of 5 lakhs!"

1551
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:19,920
We don't know about this girl.

1552
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,520
Oh no, she is a nice girl.

1553
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:24,560
But because we approached her...

1554
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:27,200
My son is in love with a girl,
and you approached her?

1555
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,920
No, he meant he approached
her friends.

1556
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,680
- Speak clearly!
- Yes...

1557
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:35,880
If you two talk to her, she will
understand Uday's love is serious...

1558
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:37,040
and agree to marry him.

1559
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,000
Yeah, right!

1560
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:40,440
You will get him married anyway.

1561
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:41,600
He will leave us.

1562
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,360
We are going to be alone now.

1563
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:45,520
You are my sons too.

1564
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,840
After he gets engaged,

1565
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,480
we will start bride hunting
for you the very next week, okay?

1566
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:52,760
So let's get Uday married next week!

1567
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:54,240
What is this?

1568
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:55,840
That was your leg?
I'm sorry.

1569
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:00,800
I hoped she'd just feed
these boys and send them away...

1570
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:03,400
but now I need to take care
of the expenses of 4 weddings!

1571
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,440
What?

1572
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,000
- We will do it!
- Nice!

1573
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,400
But sir, that was not my mistake.

1574
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:14,520
Sir please, can you just
give me one chance?

1575
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:16,920
Please!

1576
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:50,120
I am Uday's mother.

1577
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,360
I am Uday's father.

1578
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,240
Isn't she really pretty?

1579
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,240
Yes, she is.

1580
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:59,320
Going to London for her
wasn't wrong at all!

1581
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,320
Thanks!

1582
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:05,200
The boys told me that
my son and you are in love.

1583
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:07,120
Why are you dragging
our names into this?

1584
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,880
We are here to ask your hand in marriage.

1585
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,680
Take this plate.

1586
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,360
I'm in love with your son?

1587
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,400
He is the one who comes
after me like a dog!

1588
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:28,000
I lost my job and peace of mind
due to him.

1589
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:30,680
He destroyed my career and my dream
in a single day.

1590
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,600
You should be ashamed
to have a son like him!

1591
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,080
Get out.

1592
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:58,240
He is here.

1593
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:05,240
- Why did you go there with my parents?
- We thought if they come...

1594
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:07,480
She is already furious with me
because she lost her job.

1595
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,400
- Sorry, dude.
- To hell with your sorry.

1596
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:11,720
Dude!

1597
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:13,360
We didn't do anything wrong.

1598
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:14,840
What you did was wrong, Shwetha.

1599
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:16,520
What did his parents
ever do to you?

1600
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,040
He goes through a lot
for you.

1601
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,920
If you marry him,
he will keep you happy.

1602
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:25,280
There is no place for marriage
or men in my life.

1603
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,800
We aren't going to
be with you forever.

1604
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,200
You need someone, right?

1605
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:30,680
I don't need anyone.

1606
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:32,840
Listen, Shwetha...

1607
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,560
I don't know if Uday
will come back for you.

1608
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,560
Even if he doesn't
someone else will.

1609
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:40,240
If you turn that guy down,
someone else will come up.

1610
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,120
This society won't let you live alone.

1611
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:44,760
And the men here
won't allow you to live alone.

1612
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:48,040
You really love kids!

1613
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:51,360
You can get married, have a
dozen babies, and live happily!

1614
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:52,880
What she says is right.

1615
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:54,640
Think about it.

1616
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:03,160
We aren't going to
be with you forever.

1617
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:04,560
You need someone, right?

1618
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,640
This society won't let you live alone.

1619
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,320
And the men here
won't allow you to live alone.

1620
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:17,360
He is coming after me only because
I am pretty and single, right?

1621
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,720
IVF is the process that enables
women to have babies...

1622
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:36,880
by impregnating them through
artificial insemination.

1623
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:42,920
In this generation, due to several factors
like food, work style, stress etc...

1624
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,720
infertility has become common.

1625
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:50,880
By storing your reproductive cells
in sperm banks and ovary banks...

1626
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:56,800
you can use those stored cells to
have babies even 10 - 15 years later.

1627
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:58,760
Doctor, the report.

1628
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,640
Your uterus and eggs are normal.

1629
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:06,240
You are eligible for IVF.

1630
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:09,320
You are a virgin?

1631
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,040
Yes, doctor.

1632
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:13,240
Have you thought about this decision?

1633
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:14,320
Yes, doctor.

1634
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:15,880
This baby is everything to me.

1635
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:17,120
I'm ready.

1636
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:24,640
Shwetha!

1637
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:27,480
Are you doing this
out of anger?

1638
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:28,680
It's a well thought out decision!

1639
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:31,240
You fear that you will
fall in love with me, right?

1640
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:33,040
Fall in love with you?

1641
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,560
Fine, if you don't like me
I will leave.

1642
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,480
I won't come into your life again
and disturb you.

1643
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,680
But please don't do this.

1644
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,600
Not just you, no man should
ever come into my life again!

1645
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:43,200
Shwetha!

1646
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:09,560
"Is this the quietest the
Milky Way has ever seen?"

1647
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:15,120
"Does the heart ache
spread like wild fire?"

1648
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:20,400
"Is the sky pouring
artificial rain?"

1649
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:25,480
"Where is the
shoulder to lean on?"

1650
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:28,680
"Won't the moons surround me?"

1651
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:31,160
"Won't new sounds break the silence?"

1652
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:36,080
"Won't my heart ever heal?"

1653
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:47,920
Wow!

1654
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:49,640
Congratulations.

1655
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:51,240
Come only if you can.

1656
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:52,920
I'd understand otherwise.

1657
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:56,720
Actually, my family doesn't like
what you have done.

1658
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:09,760
Your mother is waiting at home
to eat with you.

1659
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:10,680
Let's go.

1660
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,240
Don't you have any brains?

1661
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:16,240
Can't you see
she doesn't want you?

1662
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:17,880
Why are you still here?
Are you mad?

1663
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:19,280
- Let's go.
- Come, dude.

1664
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:20,360
Come on!

1665
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,080
Are you coming with us or not?

1666
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:24,360
Why are you talking to him?

1667
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,480
He has gone mad.
He will never listen to us!

1668
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:31,200
How many times have I told you
not to come here?

1669
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:54,840
How are you, dear?

1670
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,080
What do you want?

1671
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,600
I want my son.

1672
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:01,800
All these years,
he really loved us.

1673
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,640
Now is he really mad about you!

1674
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,640
You know the reason?

1675
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:08,720
You didn't lie to him.

1676
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:13,840
Just like you said, you have showed
that you don't need any man in your life.

1677
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,120
Him included.

1678
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:18,480
How could he ever get over
a genuine girl like you?

1679
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:23,680
Even now, his love for you
remains intact.

1680
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:28,600
He feels guilty that you did this
out of anger towards him...

1681
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:30,800
and his love for you
has only increased.

1682
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:33,200
I'm not saying this
because he is my son.

1683
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,760
He is such a good hearted boy...

1684
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:37,880
Don't lose him.

1685
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,440
There is nothing left, Uncle.

1686
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:41,680
You need to make him understand.

1687
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,480
Mom, does it really hurt
during the delivery?

1688
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:47,680
Why do you ask?

1689
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:49,400
Tell me.

1690
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:52,200
Don't feel sad for that girl anymore.

1691
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:54,080
Think about your own life!

1692
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:56,160
Who was by your side
when I was born?

1693
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:58,800
My father, my mother,
your father...

1694
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:02,120
about 15 to 20 of our relatives.

1695
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:04,600
She only has me.

1696
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:06,480
Even she doesn't know that!

1697
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:10,720
Just marry the bride I find you
and move on with your life!

1698
01:42:49,640 --> 01:43:00,240
"These little flowers with sweet smiles;
I send them over to her address"

1699
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:09,760
"As flower petals caress her softly;
I watch happily from a distance"

1700
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:15,240
"There is no tomorrow,
yesterday isn't done."

1701
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:20,560
"Where have all the days gone?"

1702
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:58,640
"I lived by myself, like a lone tree;
But something is happening to my solitude"

1703
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:04,280
"Who is this man?
This man besides me;"

1704
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:08,600
"Like a protecting
garland around me"

1705
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:13,880
"There is no tomorrow,
yesterday isn't done."

1706
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:18,120
"Where have all the days gone?"

1707
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:24,160
"Is this the quietest the
Milky Way has ever seen?"

1708
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:29,840
"Does the heart ache
spread like wild fire?"

1709
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:35,200
"Is the sky pouring artificial rain?"

1710
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:39,800
"Where is the shoulder to lean on?"

1711
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:41,720
"Won't the moons surround me?"

1712
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:44,280
If you bring her
anywhere near this house...

1713
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,360
you will never see me alive again.

1714
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:50,640
"Won't my heart ever heal?"

1715
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:08,720
Ambulance?

1716
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:12,160
It's okay, Shwetha.
Don't be afraid.

1717
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:14,400
I'm here.
It will be okay.

1718
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,440
Nothing to fear.
The baby is doing fine.

1719
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:46,760
They've taken the baby
for a general check-up.

1720
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:01,640
Shwetha, why are you crying now?
I'm here for you.

1721
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:02,840
Don't cry.

1722
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:05,520
I'm here.

1723
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:08,840
You are here now.

1724
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,360
Will you be with me
all my life?

1725
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:13,720
This life is for you.

1726
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:16,760
Do you still love me?

1727
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:18,360
Yes.

1728
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:22,200
Let's get married right away?

1729
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:25,440
I have a baby now.

1730
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:28,200
Shwetha, that isn't just your baby.
It's my baby, too.

1731
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:29,920
Our baby.

1732
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:33,760
Why are you like this?

1733
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:35,560
Do such people even exist?

1734
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:38,840
I'll be there for you.

1735
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:58,040
That's your baby.

1736
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:16,880
Will you take care
of my baby and me?

1737
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:18,120
Definitely!

1738
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:21,040
This is my baby, okay?

1739
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,120
This isn't a tattoo.
It's my birth mark.

1740
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:50,280
Can birthmarks look like this?

1741
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:53,320
I've had no love in my life,
but he drew a heart on my hand!

1742
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:01,880
Tell me the truth.
What did you do?

1743
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:03,640
Uday, how are you?

1744
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:08,600
Uday...

1745
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,760
the girl is doing that
to spite you.

1746
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:14,800
She will understand your
true love and come back to you.

1747
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:17,280
But nothing can be changed
at that time.

1748
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:19,440
So do it right now.

1749
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:21,640
Change the bottles.

1750
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:22,520
Okay?

1751
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:23,280
You rascal!

1752
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:25,800
- Don't get angry, Shwetha...
- Answer me, you scoundrel!

1753
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:28,520
Is that your baby?
Is that why you took care of me?

1754
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:31,080
I thought you were a good guy.
You scoundrel!

1755
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:32,240
You fraud!

1756
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:33,920
- You cheated me!
- Shwetha...

1757
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,560
Who could have given
him this great idea?

1758
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:38,160
It's me!

1759
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:39,560
- Guru, you are here?
- Uncle returns!

1760
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:41,240
Yes, I am back!

1761
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:43,160
- It hurts!
- Where are you going?

1762
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:44,240
- Love!
- Yeah...

1763
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:45,560
Thank you, Love.

1764
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:46,880
You didn't even tell us.

1765
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:48,800
Wait and watch.

1766
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:52,200
- You cheated me!
- What, I gave my life to you.

1767
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:54,680
How could you do something
as irresponsible as this?

1768
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,120
No idea what's going to happen!

1769
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:58,400
How could you say that
after everything you've done?

1770
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:03,360
Why are you hitting him?

1771
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:05,320
Rather than buying seeds
from an unknown shop...

1772
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:07,920
the smart thing is buying seeds
from a familiar shop!

1773
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:09,840
Superb, Love!

1774
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:10,920
Thank you!

1775
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:41,720
Phew! They are together.

1776
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:43,480
Sorry.

1777
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:45,840
Dude, all the best!

1778
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:47,360
Buzz off, single boy.

1779
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:49,880
Careful.

1780
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:52,120
This is more painful than
what I went through to unite them.

1781
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:53,120
Love!

1782
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:55,240
Thank you!
Thank you, Love.

1783
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:57,760
Sorry, dudes!
I'll be back, okay?

1784
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:59,280
God bless you.

1785
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:00,360
Uncle!

1786
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:06,360
Shwetha, not that one.
This is our baby.

1787
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:35,880
Why do all the babies
have heart shaped birth marks?

1788
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:38,240
There were three bottles that day.
I didn't know which one was for you.

1789
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,120
So I filled all three bottles, Shwetha!

1790
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:42,200
Oh!

1791
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:45,120
Looks like the fertilizer worked on
the surrounding fields too!

1792
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,040
- Dude, just escape.
- Listen to me.

1793
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:48,920
Don't, Shwetha!

1794
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:49,920
Mummy!

1795
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:13,200
Uday, the boy looks just like you.
Like a king!

1796
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:15,240
- Thank you, Mr. Love.
- It's okay!

1797
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:17,920
If not for you,
I wouldn't have got Uday.

1798
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:21,760
People have a baby
after consummating their marriage.

1799
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:24,160
But you are going to consummate
your marriage with a baby!

1800
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:27,120
I am so proud of you guys!

1801
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:28,640
Don't bring that up now, Love!

1802
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:30,400
Okay.

1803
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:32,880
Bye!

1804
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:34,080
Where are you going?

1805
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:37,080
Love, I'm still a virgin.
This is my first time.

1806
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:38,040
Let that be.

1807
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:41,160
If you have any doubts
regarding this, ask me.

1808
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:42,520
I'll clear it out.

1809
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:45,480
Love, I saw 2 TB yesterday
and did my revision.

1810
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:48,360
Superb!

1811
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:50,200
- Superb, Love!
- Superb.

1812
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:51,240
Bye!

1813
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:52,880
Bye. Thank you.

1814
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:57,040
No love handled by this Love
has ever become a failure.

1815
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:59,360
You are a great love guru.

1816
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:02,440
If you have any love
problems, ask me.

1817
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,240
I am...

1818
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:04,360
coming...
