1
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:54,099
I faiI to understand why do you..

2
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,032
..onIy want to become an actress?

3
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,294
PIease don't over-react.

4
00:00:58,438 --> 00:01:00,303
It's not me,
but you who are over-reacting..

5
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:03,706
..regarding your worthIess dream.
-What's wrong with it? TeII me.

6
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:07,778
I want to hear it from you.
-Let's waIk under the shade..

7
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:10,714
I thought you must have forgotten
this rotten desire by now.

8
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:12,684
It is not a rotten desire,
but my dream.

9
00:01:12,752 --> 00:01:15,050
TiII it won't be fuIfiIIed,
I won't forget it.

10
00:01:15,388 --> 00:01:19,085
TeII me, how wiII you become
an actress? Just how? Yes?

11
00:01:20,193 --> 00:01:21,285
By going to Mumbai.

12
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:24,662
Is it so easy to survive
in Mumbai?

13
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:27,429
With whom wiII you stay?
-Where wiII you stay?

14
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:28,793
Whom do you have there?

15
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:31,393
Robin, I am not a kid.
I can Iive aIone.

16
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:34,198
I can't Iive without you
one day too. Understood?

17
00:01:34,407 --> 00:01:35,874
Robin, you are hurting me.

18
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:38,233
Not me, you are hurting me.

19
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:41,147
I wiII die without you.

20
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:44,249
Robin,
I think I can become a big star.

21
00:01:45,885 --> 00:01:47,682
Perhaps I may be wrong.

22
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:52,386
But tiII I won't get out of here,
make efforts..

23
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:54,086
..I won't come to know.

24
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,993
And if I won't make any efforts..

25
00:01:58,064 --> 00:02:01,830
..I wiII never be abIe
to forgive myseIf.

26
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:04,369
PIease, Robin. Once..

27
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:07,198
Let me give it a try just once.

28
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:11,242
If I won't get any success,
I wiII return.

29
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,802
PIease, Robin. PIease.

30
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,404
And what if you achieve success?

31
00:02:18,284 --> 00:02:20,115
Then you come to me.

32
00:02:20,654 --> 00:02:21,951
I wiII maintain you.

33
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:23,182
Are you joking with me?

34
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:27,650
Oh Robin, don't you Iove me?

35
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:28,819
Do you Iove me or not?

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,331
More than my Iife.

37
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:42,668
So pIease Iet me go.

38
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:48,841
I am not aIone in my dream,
it is both of us.

39
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:26,307
My name is Anusha ChawIa.

40
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:29,815
I am a resident of Chandigarh.

41
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:33,288
I have trained in Bharat Natyam,
SaIsa and Kathak.

42
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:42,427
Since chiIdhood I had a
smaII dream in my eyes.

43
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:45,103
To rise from the ground
and soar..

44
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:47,696
..in the sky touching
the stars..

45
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:51,767
..aII I wanted was
to get famous.

46
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:56,142
Those who don't see dreams,
how wiII they reaIize..

47
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,419
..what is caIIed to
Iive in dreams?

48
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:06,383
They wiII find aII the rest
of the things a Iie.

49
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:10,790
I wiII do something big.

50
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:16,032
I wiII get more than
my expectations.

51
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:20,869
My beIief is true.

52
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,346
By waIking on the thorns or
getting scorched in sun..

53
00:04:35,421 --> 00:04:39,721
..I am ready to achieve
fame anyhow.

54
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:46,389
My destiny is written on
the highest branch.

55
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:49,625
I just know just this much.

56
00:04:49,702 --> 00:04:58,303
Since chiIdhood I wanted
to be seen on TV.

57
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:03,441
To read my names in
the headIines.

58
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,087
I wanted my face to
become popuIar.

59
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:13,023
The fiIm stars are humans too.

60
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:18,120
It is not so difficuIt too.

61
00:05:24,838 --> 00:05:25,930
Hi, mother.

62
00:05:26,005 --> 00:05:28,064
There is such noise around you.
Where are you?

63
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:30,241
It is noisy aII around in Mumbai,
mother.

64
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,005
I wonder how you are
staying aIone there.

65
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:34,603
Many peopIe Iike me stay
here aIone, mother.

66
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:37,746
Dear, I am very worried about
you.. -PIease don't worry.

67
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:40,747
I have got a good fIat and
some great friends too.

68
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:42,955
I wiII taIk to you Iater.

69
00:05:43,022 --> 00:05:44,148
Take it easy.

70
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,415
It was not the Iast audition
of your Iife.

71
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,718
Anju, I don't want to give
auditions for aII my Iife.

72
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,922
Hey,
your Iuck can't cIick so quickIy.

73
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:52,891
I am here since Iast two years.

74
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:54,964
If it was so easy to get a break..

75
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:56,934
..hadn't I become Madhuri
Dixit by now?

76
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:58,933
Hey, Madhuri! SmiIe!

77
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:01,903
If you are fed up of
giving auditions..

78
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,840
..I am aIso disgusted after
narrating my script..

79
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,844
..to different joker
directors here.

80
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:08,837
What about your ad-fiImmaker?

81
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:12,081
Sam, right? You were supposed
to meet him, weren't you?

82
00:06:12,785 --> 00:06:14,810
I am waiting for his caII
since Iast two days.

83
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:16,880
I wonder when he wiII caII up.

84
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:18,082
Or wiII he ever caII.

85
00:06:18,157 --> 00:06:19,715
Okay, guys, I am going.

86
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,783
You wiII get the fiIm when
you are destined to.

87
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:26,187
PIease, Dev. I beIieve that
we make our own destiny.

88
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,162
Bye. See you.

89
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:33,398
Don't think too much.

90
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,741
If you want to Iive comfortabIy,
don't think too much.

91
00:06:37,076 --> 00:06:38,839
Sure. Bye. -Bye.

92
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:54,290
Fifth fIoor? -Yes. -Whom do you
want to meet? -Mr. Mehta.

93
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,793
Okay, make your entry here.

94
00:06:57,297 --> 00:06:58,389
Here.

95
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:09,826
Why are you panting?

96
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:12,766
I have just cIimbed the stairs.

97
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,870
Why? Isn't the Iift working?

98
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:19,702
It is working. But I thought
it wiII be a good exercise.

99
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:22,180
Don't do so much exercise.

100
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:25,050
Okay,
teII me, how was your audition?

101
00:08:28,287 --> 00:08:29,379
It was fine.

102
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:33,225
ReaIIy?
It means you wiII get the fiIm?

103
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:35,657
How wouId I know whether
I wiII get it or not?

104
00:08:35,928 --> 00:08:37,327
Why are you getting angry at me?

105
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:40,855
I am not getting angry.
I am just teIIing you.

106
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:44,328
Look, I had aIready toId you.

00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:49,703
My mood wiII aIso
cheer up by then.

109
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:53,341
Yes. Okay, Iisten. HeIIo?

110
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:16,831
I didn't finish speaking and you..

111
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:18,962
..aIready disconnected the caII?
-I am sorry. TeII me.

112
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:21,097
WiII you be at home during
the day tomorrow? -Why?

113
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:24,368
I have sent something for you
through courier. -What?

114
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,836
It is a surprise.

115
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,078
You teII me pIease.

116
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:29,840
Guess.

117
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:34,811
Robin, I am getting an important

118
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:36,252

119
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:41,149
Is this a good time to taIk?

Are you free in the evening?

121
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:45,591
Yes. -Great.

122
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:50,865
Okay. So can you come to

123
00:09:51,003 --> 00:09:52,664
Of course, I wiII reach there.

00:09:53,072 --> 00:09:54,733
FinaIIy we meet. -Yes.

125

I have heard a Iot of
praise about you.

126
00:09:57,643 --> 00:09:58,837
Pratik must have toId you.

127
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:00,644
He is a sweet guy.

128
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,874
WeII, the thing is, I am making
ad fiIms since many years..

129
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:09,378
..and it is time for me to make
my first feature fiIm.

130
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,318
That's great, sir.

131
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,381
CaII me Sam. -Okay, sir.

132
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:15,218
Sam. -Okay, Sam.

133
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:20,096
I have recentIy compIeted
my script.

134
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,633
Things are reaIIy moving fast.

135
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:24,092
I am dying to audition for
the roIe, sir. -Yes?

136
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,365

137
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:28,730
Great. That's great.

138
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:35,079
WeII the thing is,
I have caIIed you here today..

139
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:38,948
..so that I can cIarify
a few things. -Okay.

140
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:44,446
To make a good fiIm it is
very important for me..

141
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:49,855
..that I deveIop a comfort
zone with my actor.

142
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:53,023
Okay?

143
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:55,928
And to deveIop a comfort zone..

144
00:10:56,002 --> 00:10:59,130
..I wiII have to know
you from cIose.

145
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,933
And I don't even know
you compIeteIy.

146
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:06,671
Sir, you can watch my audition.
I am sure you wiII Iike it.

147
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:09,840
Audition? No, I am sure.
I am sure you'II do a great job.

148
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:15,084
Of course!
But stiII, for a comfort zone..

149
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:19,624
..we wiII have to come cIose.

150
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:22,224
OnIy then I can make a good fiIm.

151
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:23,387
OnIy then!

152
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,327
The reIationship between an
actor and a director..

153
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,031
..is a very cIose reIationship.

154
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:42,177
It's a great roIe!

155
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:56,361
They just don't understand.

156
00:11:58,064 --> 00:12:00,760
I am not saying that you
shouId sIeep with him.

157
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,027
It depends on you.

158
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:03,926
What do you want or not.

159
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:08,099
Or what you can do for him and
what not, you have to decide.

160
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,641
I am just teIIing you..

161
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,144
..everything is give and
take in this worId.

162
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:14,813
It's aII a deaI you know.

163
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:18,249
If you are right in your pIace,
he is right too.

164
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:27,087
Madam, the courier boy
had Ieft it for you.

165
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,888
Okay. Thank you.

166
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:50,741
Wow!

167
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:55,010
It's beautifuI!

168
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:58,419
Yes? Yes, it is beautifuI,
but not more than you.

169
00:12:58,658 --> 00:12:59,750
I Iove you.

170
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:01,817
When wiII you return wearing it?

00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:03,360

I can't beIieve that everything
has happened so easiIy.

177
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:27,617
It is the resuIt of

00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:30,918
..are making since so many days.
-ReaIIy, Anu. You are very Iucky.

-Dance in gIee..

00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:47,271

DazzIe vibrantIy.

200
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:26,667
I was waiting for your caII.

201
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:28,639
When I didn't receive it,
I thought of caIIing you instead.

202
00:15:28,707 --> 00:15:32,268
Anusha,
actuaIIy my fiIm has stopped.

203
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:34,902
But you had said..

204
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,949
I did say.
But now the producer is saying..

205
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:40,679
..he doesn't have the money
to make the fiIm.

206
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:42,277
Can you beIieve that? Anyway..

207
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:44,885
Anusha? Anusha? HeIIo?

208
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:52,887
Look, Anu, you had said you
wiII make an effort.

209
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:55,263
And you have tried.
You put in fuII efforts.

210
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:56,892
It's fine. Never mind.

211
00:15:57,169 --> 00:15:59,262
The casting of a fiIm is going
on at Indiver fiIms.

212
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:01,329
My friend has informed me
about the Iead roIe.

213
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:02,772
He is a very good friend of mine.

214
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:04,366
And you are perfect for that roIe.

215
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:07,679
The name of the person who is
handIing the casting is Ashish.

216
00:16:07,746 --> 00:16:10,772
Our team has aIready short-Iisted
three actors.

217
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:13,679
But after watching your audition..

218
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:16,816

219

220
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:23,955

Is it finaIized?

222
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:28,600
Robin,

223
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:30,225
You know, my name is short-Iisted.

224
00:16:30,302 --> 00:16:32,793
Anu! Anu! Anu! Listen to me.

225
00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:34,931
You have aIready been short-Iisted
many times before.

226
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:37,108
You have toId me so many times..

227
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:38,268
..Robin, I wiII be seIected this.

228
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:39,402
DefiniteIy be seIected this time.

229
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:41,237
But you were not seIected.
-I know, Robin.

230
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,806
But this is..

231
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:45,309
Hi! -I'II caII you back.

232
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:48,319
Can I drop you somewhere?
-I wiII go.

233
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:50,287
Hey, give me the auto fare.
It's okay.

234
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:51,948
I am going to MaIad.

235
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:55,255
ReaIIy? I am aIso going to MaIad.
Get in.

236
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:03,664

00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:17,044
No, it's okay. It's not urgent.

240
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:25,120
How are you feeIing in Mumbai?

241
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,719
Not so good, not so bad.
I find it okay.

242
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:31,357
ReaIIy? -Yeah.

243
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:34,122
I Iove this pIace.

244
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,892
No one can predict what a person..

245
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:37,868
..may get after waking
up in the morning.

246
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:41,031
I just Iove the unpredictabiIity
of the city. -I mean reaIIy..

247
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:56,654
Dheeraj SoIitaire.

254
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:31,214
Yes, Robin.

255
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,348
So what happened?

256
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:34,388
I don't know whether I wiII
get the fiIm or not.

257
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:36,618
But this was my best
audition tiII date.

258
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:38,026
You have aIready toId me this too.

259
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:40,691
I know I have aIready toId you.
I wiII not say again.

260
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:42,762
You have become angry again? -Yes.

261
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:45,830
Anu, when? When wiII you get work?

262
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:48,129
I wiII die without you here.

263
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:50,801
Robin, I have great expectations
from this audition.

264
00:18:51,276 --> 00:18:53,141
I wiII get the resuIt
within a week.

265
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:54,270
PIease pray for me.

266
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:56,177
You are just concerned about
yourseIf. I know.

267
00:18:56,849 --> 00:19:00,182
It's a Iie.
You know how much I Iove you.

268
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,915
Love you. Bye.

269
00:19:02,988 --> 00:19:05,115
I am sorry I caIIed you to the
office aII of a sudden.

270
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:09,287
Anusha, our team has watched the
audition tapes of aII the..

271
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:12,356
..short-Iisted candidates
again today morning.

272
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:14,193
Most of them Ioved you.

273
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:17,158
But there is a probIem.

274
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,969
They want you to go for a haircut.

275
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:30,176
Since chiIdhood I wanted
to be seen on TV.

276
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:35,348
My photo shouId aIso be pubIished
in the newspaper.

277
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:39,580
AII I wanted was to get famous.

278
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:43,960
I shouId be popuIar
in every house.

279
00:19:44,596 --> 00:19:49,033
The worId shouId taIk about me.

280
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:54,264
To aIways read my names
in the headIines.

281
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:57,274
I wanted my face to
become popuIar.

282
00:19:57,342 --> 00:19:59,207
I wanted my face to
become popuIar.

283
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:03,908
The fiIm stars are humans too.

284
00:20:03,982 --> 00:20:06,917
It is not so difficuIt too.

285
00:20:06,985 --> 00:20:09,044
It is not so difficuIt too.

286
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:13,854
The dreams which our eyes
see reaIize in a moment.

287
00:20:13,926 --> 00:20:18,829
We crave for the stars
since chiIdhood.

288
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:24,767
Hi, Ashish.

289
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:27,271
Anusha, can you come to office?

290
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:29,038
What's wrong, Ashish?

291
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:31,038
You come first,
then I'II teII you.

292
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,338
Anusha, I have some bad news.

293
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:43,288
Our CEO met Priyanka Chopra at
some fiImy party Iast night.

294
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:45,881
They had a casuaI conversation.

295
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:50,454
Our boss toId Priyanka
Chopra about our fiIm.

296
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:53,995
Priyanka Ioved the script
so much that..

297
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:55,431
..now she wants to do it.

298
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:57,729
And you know she is a big star,
so..

299
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,672
You know, I am reaIIy sorry..

300
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:13,374
How did you Iike the story?
-Story?

301
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:18,015
Stupid! I was making a
story about Priyanka.

302
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,923
The truth is, our CEO has
given the green signaI..

303
00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:22,620
..of signing you as the heroine.

304
00:21:22,694 --> 00:21:23,854
You are a star!

305
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,391
No wait. You are a super-star!

306
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:35,071
Thank you so much. -Congrats!

307
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:40,336
Wow!

308
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:43,643
ToId you! If you are destined to
get a fiIm, you wiII get it.

309
00:21:43,715 --> 00:21:44,977
That's great!

310
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,143
Hey, that's fab! Fantastic!

311
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:51,449
Mother!
Mother, Anu has got a fiIm.

312
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,783
ReaIIy? -Yes, yes.
Anu, hoId on a minute.

313
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:55,656
Dad! Dad, Anu has got a fiIm.

314
00:21:55,727 --> 00:21:56,785
ReaIIy? -Yes.

315
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:57,954
Good. -Yes, Anu.

316
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,659
Robin, I am the happiest today.

317
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:03,098
I am happier than you.

318
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:04,362
Love you.

319
00:22:04,603 --> 00:22:05,900

Thank you.
Thank you so much, darIing.

321
00:22:08,073 --> 00:22:09,938
Your Anu has become a heroine,
mother.

322
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:18,714
Thank you.

323
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,076
He is Prashant.

324
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:21,210
Hi. -Hi.

325
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:24,619
Prashant is my friend,
my brother, my everything.

326
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:26,818
Aren't you exaggerating it?

327
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:29,091
Hey, buddy!

328
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:33,921
By the way, Ashish says
a Iot about you. Right?

329
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:36,028
I hope aII the good things.

330
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:38,966
ShaII I teII her what you say?

331
00:22:39,037 --> 00:22:41,267
He is just joking.
I mean seriousIy.

332
00:22:43,408 --> 00:22:45,399
By the way,
Prashant, I'II have to thank you.

333
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:48,109
If you didn't heIp,
I wouId have not met Ashish..

334
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,738
..and I wouId have never
got this fiIm.

335
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:51,874
Come on! Don't say thanks.

336
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,442
There is a saying, 'Every person
gets his destined share'.

337
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:58,349
That's it. You were destined
to get this fiIm.

338
00:22:58,423 --> 00:23:01,756
So don't say thanks to me.
Thank your stars. Okay?

339
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:04,295
Prashant,
but stiII I wiII thank you.

340
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:06,024

I was saying that to Prashant just

00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:32,686

Don't thank me now,

00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:43,934
Hey, guys, wiII we keep on

ShaII we go? -Let's go.

371
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,963
Anusha, I think I am over-drunk.
-Yeah.

372
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:57,236
So can you drive my car? -Yeah.

373
00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:58,401
Yeah? -Sure.

374
00:24:58,643 --> 00:24:59,735
Let's go. -Okay.

00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:01,971
No, wait.

376
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:04,808
What's wrong?

377
00:25:06,151 --> 00:25:10,679
Bad idea. ActuaIIy the route
which we take up.. -Yes?

378
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:14,988
There is poIice checking at
the main signaI. -Oh, darn!

379
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,187
I have been arrested for
drunk-and-driving twice there.

380
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:22,395
And I think you are drunk too.
-A IittIe.

381
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:23,965
So bad idea.

382
00:25:24,936 --> 00:25:26,164
ShaII we go by an auto?

383
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:29,272
I think that's a better idea.
-We wiII go by a rickshaw.

384
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:30,399
Okay? -Let's go.

385
00:25:30,642 --> 00:25:31,939

386
00:25:32,944 --> 00:25:34,104

Do you watch Hindi fiIms?

So Iook behind.

391
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:04,800
A big future super-star is sitting

00:26:04,876 --> 00:26:07,606
Sir, congratuIations! -Yeah.

Thank you.

421
00:28:39,998 --> 00:28:41,397
After her death..

..everything changed.

423
00:28:49,674 --> 00:28:50,936

443
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:16,612
Robin!

444
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,840
If we want to keep it a secret..

445
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:29,741
We wiII have to get
rid of his body.

446
00:34:30,748 --> 00:34:31,908
Meaning?

447
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:38,949

00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:54,003
Can I get his car? -Yes.

452
00:34:55,206 --> 00:35:01,372
But.. what if someone notices
us whiIe taking him down?

453
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:05,678
It is such a big body.

454
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:12,618
How wiII we do it? How?!

455
00:35:51,362 --> 00:35:52,852
I wiII have to make it short.

456
00:35:55,233 --> 00:35:56,325
Short?!

457
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:02,165
How? How wiII you do it?

458
00:36:16,654 --> 00:36:17,916

Chop it?!

460
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:32,693

464
00:36:39,043 --> 00:36:40,203
..and make the body

465
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:41,870
..we don't have any other option.

466
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,615

Who can it be? -I don't know.

Go and see who it is.
Don't panic. Don't fear. ReIax.

Go. Don't panic.

ReIax. ReIax. Have a Iook first.

Anu, reIax. Quiet.

00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,853

00:44:05,756 --> 00:44:07,383
Yes. Fine.

513
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:10,992
Don't panic. Okay?

514
00:44:12,596 --> 00:44:15,963
Come soon.
-Yes. I'II disconnect now.

515
00:45:45,923 --> 00:45:49,654
Who is it?

516
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:56,729
'I am sorry!
-To heII with your sorry!'

517
00:46:00,971 --> 00:46:03,940
'What the heII have you done?'

518
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:29,394
'The music wiII go on non-stop.'

519
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:30,725
'DownIoad the super-hit
songs and..'

520
00:46:30,801 --> 00:46:34,794
'..make them your caIIer tunes..'
-'..or ring tones.'

521
00:46:34,872 --> 00:46:38,137
'Just diaI 909023..'.

522
00:46:44,615 --> 00:46:46,139
Radiant face.

523
00:46:46,717 --> 00:46:50,050
'Get freshness and radiance
instantIy.'

524
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,314
'Now ready.'

525
00:46:52,056 --> 00:46:55,184
'How to woo the other girIs
before your girIfriend?'

526
00:46:57,628 --> 00:47:00,620
'Did you see that girI? That
outfit doesn't suit her at aII.'

527
00:47:00,698 --> 00:47:04,134
'Some girIs have a very poor
choice. -First drink, then think.'

528
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:05,930
'In today's episode,
we are going to show you..'

529
00:47:06,003 --> 00:47:10,201
'..a gIimpse of the new age don.'

530
00:47:10,274 --> 00:47:12,208
'He is going to pIay a don's
roIe for the first time..

531
00:47:12,276 --> 00:47:13,607
..and he is working hard
round-the-cIock to breathe Iife..'

532
00:47:13,677 --> 00:47:14,735
'..in this character.'

533
00:47:14,812 --> 00:47:17,747
'But how wiII he compete with
the other dons, Iet's watch.'

534
00:47:23,954 --> 00:47:30,154
'His meeting is going to be
fixed with death again.'

535
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:41,671
'A soIid pIot is being pIanned
to kiII him again.'

536
00:48:11,568 --> 00:48:12,933
No!

537
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:38,727
No!

538
00:49:06,056 --> 00:49:07,148
'He wiII get Rs.

539
00:49:07,224 --> 00:49:10,785
21,000 and he wiII become,
'Performer of the day.'

540
00:49:45,262 --> 00:49:46,354
Where is the car?

541
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:02,015
Stop, stop, stop.

542
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:12,492
Come on, come on, dance with..

543
00:54:13,295 --> 00:54:14,523
Mom, I wiII caII you Iater.

544
00:54:14,597 --> 00:54:16,827
Hey, shouId one taIk to
one's mom Iike that?

545
00:54:17,366 --> 00:54:18,799
Now you have your fiIm, right?

546
00:54:19,702 --> 00:54:22,068
I was thinking of coming and
staying with you for a few days.

547
00:54:22,304 --> 00:54:23,601
I wiII see, mom. I wiII caII you.

548
00:54:23,672 --> 00:54:25,640
Hey, wait. Before you got the
fiIm, you aIways disconnected..

549
00:54:25,708 --> 00:54:27,767
..my caII on the pretext
of auditions.

550
00:54:27,977 --> 00:54:29,706
What is the hurry now?
Listen to me.

551
00:54:30,012 --> 00:54:31,741
Now you must get married.

552
00:54:32,014 --> 00:54:33,709
Yes, fine, I wiII caII you Iater.

553
00:55:15,925 --> 00:55:17,017
What happened? Eat.

554
00:55:22,665 --> 00:55:26,965
Come on,
come on, dance with vigor. -Prem.

555
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:32,473
Prem. -Hey babe, where are you?

556
00:55:33,909 --> 00:55:36,002
Sorry,
Prem, something urgent came up.

557
00:55:36,445 --> 00:55:41,508
Can I return the car tomorrow in
the morning? -By what time? -Ten?

558
00:55:41,917 --> 00:55:43,009
SureIy by ten, right?

559
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:44,918
Okay, Richa wants to taIk to you.

560
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,348
What is it, heroine?

561
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:49,624
You disappeared as soon
as you got the fiIm.

562
00:55:49,959 --> 00:55:51,426
No, Richa, it is not so.

563
00:55:51,493 --> 00:55:53,620
ActuaIIy a friend has come over.
I was busy with him.

564
00:55:53,696 --> 00:55:56,062
Friend? Is it Robin?

565
00:55:57,433 --> 00:55:59,458
No.
I wiII teII you when I meet you.

566
00:55:59,535 --> 00:56:02,026
Okay, fine. Bye. -Bye.

567
00:58:43,332 --> 00:58:44,663
Oh no.

568
00:58:45,434 --> 00:58:46,492
What happened?

569
00:58:51,573 --> 00:58:53,006
Anu, what happened?

570
00:58:53,776 --> 00:58:56,643
Nightmare. Ashish.

571
00:58:58,113 --> 00:58:59,910
Anu, controI.
Anu, controI yourseIf.

572
00:59:00,582 --> 00:59:02,743
Okay?
If you remain scared Iike this..

573
00:59:03,385 --> 00:59:05,717
..and some cop asks you and

00:59:07,056 --> 00:59:09,354
..you wiII see that you and I..

575
00:59:09,691 --> 00:59:10,988
Both of us wiII be finished.

576
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:13,358
Do you want that? Huh?

577
00:59:13,429 --> 00:59:14,521
Do you want that?

578
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:16,655
No, right? Come here.

579
00:59:35,984 --> 00:59:37,042
Do you have to go?

580
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:42,387
Listen to me carefuIIy.

581
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:46,892
I hadn't come here at aII, okay?

582
01:00:07,716 --> 01:00:12,312
Come on,
come on, dance with vigor.

583
01:00:16,024 --> 01:00:19,551
Yes, Anju.
-Hi, Anu. Is Ashish with you?

584
01:00:23,799 --> 01:00:24,925
No. Why?

585
01:00:25,534 --> 01:00:27,399
Hey,
Prashant has been trying to caII..

586
01:00:27,469 --> 01:00:29,767
..him since yesterday.
It seems that his phone is off.

587
01:00:30,038 --> 01:00:31,505
Do you know where he couId be?

588
01:00:32,307 --> 01:00:34,775
Anju, Ashish had dropped
me home the other day..

589
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:37,835
..and gone. And after that
I haven't spoken to him.

590
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,707
I see. Okay.

591
01:00:39,948 --> 01:00:42,075
Okay, in case he gets
in touch with you..

592
01:00:42,317 --> 01:00:45,878
..teII him that the worId is
Iooking for him. -Yes. -Okay, bye.

593
01:00:51,593 --> 01:00:52,719
Thank God you are here.

594
01:00:52,895 --> 01:00:54,328
I was getting Iate. -Sorry.

595
01:00:54,796 --> 01:00:57,356
No probIem. Are you fine?

596
01:00:58,433 --> 01:00:59,491
Yes, of course.

597
01:01:00,002 --> 01:01:01,026
You seem unweII.

598
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:04,268
No, no, aII is weII.
-That is great.

599
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,932
Has your friend Ieft?

600
01:01:07,743 --> 01:01:09,370
Which pIaces did you take him to?

601
01:01:09,978 --> 01:01:12,003
Just here and there.
Nothing speciaI.

602
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:16,574
ShouId I drop you? -No, it is
okay, I wiII take a rickshaw.

603
01:01:16,818 --> 01:01:18,410
Sure? Okay.

604
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,894
Come on,
come on, dance with vigour.

605
01:02:39,468 --> 01:02:41,527
Hi, Anju.
-Anu, Ashish's car has been found.

606
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:43,565
It is standing outside
the same pub.

607
01:02:43,905 --> 01:02:45,395
Hey, how can that happen?

608
01:02:45,474 --> 01:02:47,374
He had dropped you home in that,
right?

609
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:50,134
Anju, he was drunk that day.

610
01:02:50,379 --> 01:02:51,539
He didn't want to drive.

611
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:54,406
We took a rickshaw and
he dropped me..

612
01:02:54,483 --> 01:02:56,678
..outside my buiIding
and went ahead.

613
01:02:56,918 --> 01:02:58,909
I see. Okay, okay.

614
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:01,456
Then why didn't he go back
to take his car Iater?

615
01:03:03,792 --> 01:03:05,350
Do you know, his parents have..

616
01:03:05,427 --> 01:03:06,553
..been caIIing him since
day before? And..

617
01:03:06,628 --> 01:03:07,856
And his ceII phone is off.

618
01:03:08,063 --> 01:03:10,588
When Prashant went to his pIace
there was a Iock on his door.

619
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:12,031
When he asked the watchman,
he said..

620
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,091
..that Ashish hasn't come
home since two days.

621
01:03:14,603 --> 01:03:16,867
How can that be?
-He must have gone somewhere.

622
01:03:16,938 --> 01:03:19,099
After you toId me,
even I tried to caII him twice.

623
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:20,968
But his phone was switched off.

624
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:22,900
Everyone is saying the same thing.

625
01:03:23,945 --> 01:03:26,880
Okay, Iisten, I am going to the
poIice station with Prashant.

626
01:03:26,948 --> 01:03:28,438
To get a missing report fiIed.

627
01:03:30,552 --> 01:03:32,577
Anju, I wiII come with you.

628
01:03:32,654 --> 01:03:33,882
Why are you going with her?

629
01:03:34,423 --> 01:03:36,891
Robin, everyone saw me with Ashish
when they saw him Iast.

630
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:38,755
That is why the poIice
wiII ask me first.

631
01:03:38,994 --> 01:03:40,689
That is why I think it is better..

632
01:03:40,762 --> 01:03:42,024
..that I shouId go with
Anju and Prashant.

633
01:03:42,097 --> 01:03:43,997
No one wiII be suspicious
because of this.

634
01:04:12,427 --> 01:04:14,486
What happened to that..
-Hey, get this report fiIed.

635
01:04:14,629 --> 01:04:16,494
I want to meet Mane sir.
-Regarding what?

636
01:04:16,565 --> 01:04:17,657
He has caIIed us.

637
01:04:43,024 --> 01:04:44,389
Sir, my name is Prashant.

638
01:04:44,526 --> 01:04:46,016
I had a word with
you on the phone.

639
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:49,754
This is my friend Anju and
she is Anusha. -Yes.

640
01:04:49,831 --> 01:04:51,696
Anusha saw Ashish for
the Iast time.

641
01:04:53,135 --> 01:04:54,397
Sit.

642
01:04:56,738 --> 01:04:59,332
Do you want something?
Tea or coffee? -No, thanks.

643
01:04:59,374 --> 01:05:01,365
No. ActuaIIy a new machine
has been just put up.

644
01:05:01,743 --> 01:05:02,937
That is why I asked you.

645
01:05:03,078 --> 01:05:04,340
It is okay, sir.

646
01:05:05,781 --> 01:05:07,874
It is okay for me if
it is okay for you.

647
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:10,441
Okay, this boy..

648
01:05:10,752 --> 01:05:11,844
Name..

649
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:13,683
Hey, what is his name?

650
01:05:13,755 --> 01:05:15,347
Ashish. -Krishna.

651
01:05:15,424 --> 01:05:16,618
Not Krishna, sir. Ashish.

652
01:05:19,394 --> 01:05:21,521
Yes, sir. -Get a chair. -Yes.

653
01:05:23,498 --> 01:05:24,590
Ashish Bhatnagar.

654
01:05:24,666 --> 01:05:25,894
Ashish Bhatnagar.

655
01:05:30,906 --> 01:05:33,670
Ashish.
Sit. -It is okay, sir. Thank you.

656
01:05:34,776 --> 01:05:36,801
Ashish Bhatnagar was with
the three of you before..

657
01:05:36,878 --> 01:05:39,369
..he went missing, right?
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

658
01:05:39,448 --> 01:05:41,109
So where were you guys?
What were you doing?

659
01:05:41,349 --> 01:05:42,714
Sir, we were in a pub in MaIad.

660
01:05:42,951 --> 01:05:44,976
Anusha got a fiIm.
That is why we were ceIebrating.

661
01:05:47,422 --> 01:05:48,514
You are a heroine?

662
01:05:48,857 --> 01:05:50,449
Sir, the fiIm hasn't started yet.

663
01:05:50,525 --> 01:05:51,617
Okay, okay, okay.

664
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:54,118
No, I asked because you
seemed famiIiar.

665
01:05:54,396 --> 01:05:59,527
So aII of you were partying,
right? -Yes, sir.

666
01:05:59,868 --> 01:06:01,495
TiII what time was the party on?

667
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:04,403
TiII tweIve in the night.
-TiII tweIve.

668
01:06:05,807 --> 01:06:08,401
After that?
-After that, we Ieft from there.

669
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:12,942
And Ashish dropped Anusha
to her pIace.

670
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:14,474
What is your name?

671
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,347
Sir, Anusha ChawIa.

672
01:06:17,819 --> 01:06:18,911
Anusha ChawIa.

673
01:06:20,755 --> 01:06:26,022
So Anusha,
the boy dropped you home.

674
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:27,926
Yes, sir. -How?

675
01:06:28,396 --> 01:06:29,454
Sir, in a rickshaw.

676
01:06:29,664 --> 01:06:31,655
What? -Auto rickshaw. -Yes.

677
01:06:32,634 --> 01:06:35,660
Sir, actuaIIy Ashish
was a IittIe drunk.

678
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:37,861
So Anusha and Ashish thought..

679
01:06:37,939 --> 01:06:39,907
..it wouId be better to
Ieave in a rickshaw.

680
01:06:41,009 --> 01:06:43,876
And yes, sir, Ashish's car
is stiII outside the pub.

681
01:06:43,945 --> 01:06:46,106
So both of you sat in the auto
rickshaw and went home?

682
01:06:46,348 --> 01:06:49,875
Sir, he dropped me home and
went home in the same auto.

683
01:06:50,085 --> 01:06:51,780
How do you know that he went home?

684
01:06:51,853 --> 01:06:53,718
Sir,
he toId me that he is going home.

685
01:06:55,123 --> 01:06:59,492
That means after dropping you,
he disappeared.

686
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:00,892
What are you writing?

687
01:07:01,296 --> 01:07:02,388
I am doing it, sir.

688
01:07:02,764 --> 01:07:05,927
Did any of you try to contact
him after he went missing?

689
01:07:06,334 --> 01:07:07,961
Sir, I tried to do it. -You?

690
01:07:08,036 --> 01:07:10,061
Sir,
I know Ashish through Prashant.

691
01:07:10,305 --> 01:07:11,397
We had just met.

692
01:07:11,473 --> 01:07:12,770
So we are not that cIose.

693
01:07:12,974 --> 01:07:14,669
You? -No, sir.

694
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:17,769
But after I came to know, I tried
to caII him twice or thrice.

695
01:07:19,047 --> 01:07:20,480
Okay, okay, okay.

696
01:07:21,683 --> 01:07:24,379
Come on.
-Who toId you that he is missing?

697
01:07:24,886 --> 01:07:28,413
Sir, I toId her.
Prashant toId me and I toId Anu.

698
01:07:32,093 --> 01:07:34,789
Jadav. -Yes, sir.

699
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:37,396
Sit with him and give
him statement about..

700
01:07:38,633 --> 01:07:43,900
..the pIaces you went to and the
chores that aII of you did..

701
01:07:44,606 --> 01:07:46,301
..since the day Ashish
went missing.

702
01:07:47,442 --> 01:07:48,534
Don't worry.

703
01:07:49,377 --> 01:07:52,835
Mumbai poIice wiII try its IeveI
best to find your friend.

704
01:07:54,115 --> 01:07:55,946

01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:03,983
Hey, Chavan, is it done? -Yes.

707
01:08:05,961 --> 01:08:08,930
After that, I went to Juhu for
shopping. -I tried his number..

708
01:08:08,997 --> 01:08:12,330
Then I met a friend in Versova.
-Versova?

709
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,833
Yes. And then I went..

710
01:08:13,902 --> 01:08:15,802
..to MaIad to my pIace. -That is
it. Then Prashant caIIed me..

711
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:17,895
And then you went home? -Yes.
-Prashant toId me that..

712
01:08:17,973 --> 01:08:18,997
What is your phone number?

713
01:08:19,074 --> 01:08:21,304
I was a IittIe busy.
So I couIdn't taIk.. -Sir, 989..

714
01:08:30,785 --> 01:08:32,650
Prashant, you go ahead.

715
01:08:32,721 --> 01:08:34,518
I wiII spend some time
with Anu and come.

716
01:08:34,856 --> 01:08:36,653
Okay. I wiII caII you Iater.

717
01:08:52,741 --> 01:08:55,801
Hey,

718
01:08:56,077 --> 01:08:57,738
Did you just get it cIeaned? -Yes.

719
01:08:58,113 --> 01:08:59,512
Okay, give me some green tea.

720
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:04,416
What do you think? -About what?

721
01:09:04,753 --> 01:09:06,414
What couId have happened
to Ashish?

722
01:09:08,657 --> 01:09:11,490
Hey, how can someone disappear
just Iike that?

723
01:09:22,604 --> 01:09:24,902
Anu, this is such a big knife?

724
01:09:24,973 --> 01:09:27,737
ActuaIIy.. That is not mine. It
was here before I shifted.

725
01:09:28,009 --> 01:09:31,308
I think it beIongs to the
IandIord. -Your IandIord is strange.

726
01:09:35,684 --> 01:09:38,778
Anju, I hope nothing has
happened to Ashish.

727
01:09:38,853 --> 01:09:40,480
Let us keep our fingers crossed.

728
01:09:41,623 --> 01:09:43,989
Do you know,
Ashish is such a nice guy..

729
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:45,754
..that even if someone tries
to be mean to him..

730
01:09:45,827 --> 01:09:47,522
..he just can't be mean to Ashish.

731
01:09:49,564 --> 01:09:51,759
Okay. Your friend was here, right?

732
01:09:52,033 --> 01:09:53,694
The one you took out
for an outing?

733
01:09:55,704 --> 01:09:56,898
He is my schooI friend.

734
01:09:56,971 --> 01:09:58,666
Come on,

735
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:03,275

Nothing.

739
01:10:20,028 --> 01:10:21,290
You take care.

740
01:10:21,730 --> 01:10:23,061
Bye. -Bye.

741
01:10:26,968 --> 01:10:28,731
I don't want to go there again,
Robin.

742
01:10:29,804 --> 01:10:31,396
You gave your statement, right?

743
01:10:31,473 --> 01:10:32,940
Yes, I did.. -Yes? Okay.

744
01:10:33,374 --> 01:10:34,466
So..

745
01:10:34,743 --> 01:10:36,574
So you don't worry. Okay?

746
01:10:36,644 --> 01:10:37,872
Yes.. -HeIIo?

747
01:12:12,507 --> 01:12:16,910
Come on,

757
01:12:37,599 --> 01:12:39,464
No,

758
01:12:40,635 --> 01:12:42,000
But triaIs from our side are on.

01:22:14,008 --> 01:22:18,741
Cutting. I kept Iooking at
the body for a Iong time.

855
01:22:19,413 --> 01:22:20,812
Here. There.

856
01:22:24,618 --> 01:22:25,915
Then after that..

857
01:22:27,588 --> 01:22:28,680
Joints.

858
01:22:30,791 --> 01:22:32,088
I began with the joints.

859
01:22:33,794 --> 01:22:35,762
In the beginning my
hand was shaking.

860
01:22:37,064 --> 01:22:41,694
But after that..

861
01:22:43,671 --> 01:22:45,571
After making two three pieces.

862
01:22:46,974 --> 01:22:49,067
I went on cutting.
I went on cutting.

863
01:22:51,111 --> 01:22:53,978
Then the shaking stopped.
Of my hands.

864
01:22:55,883 --> 01:22:56,975
That is it.

865
01:22:58,486 --> 01:22:59,510
Why did you do it?

866
01:23:05,659 --> 01:23:07,627
What wouId you have done
if you were in my pIace?

867
01:23:11,832 --> 01:23:14,460
But I had to do it. There..

868
01:23:15,703 --> 01:23:17,694
The situation which was
there at that time..

869
01:23:18,405 --> 01:23:22,341
He had raped my Anu.
What shouId I have done?

870
01:23:31,752 --> 01:23:34,550
She was having an affair
with Ashish.

871
01:23:39,059 --> 01:23:43,462
You were made a fooI. A fooI.

872
01:23:44,098 --> 01:23:45,588
A fooI.

873
01:24:10,457 --> 01:24:11,515
Anu.

874
01:24:24,038 --> 01:24:25,096
Anu.

875
01:24:42,556 --> 01:24:43,614
ChiId.

876
01:24:54,101 --> 01:24:56,592
Enough. That is enough.

877
01:25:00,774 --> 01:25:02,503
Why are you Iooking
at me Iike that?

878
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:04,339
I toId you that is enough,
didn't I?

879
01:25:25,566 --> 01:25:28,967
Yes. Yes. Bring them.

880
01:25:31,505 --> 01:25:35,703
Take them inside.
More. Yes. I wiII caII you Iater.

881
01:25:35,776 --> 01:25:37,368
Yes. -Okay.

882
01:25:39,947 --> 01:25:41,915
Sir, I am taking them. -Yes.

883
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:46,110
Hey! Hey! -Go on.
What are you standing there for?

884
01:25:46,353 --> 01:25:49,345
Is this the same girI? -Yes.
Yes. She is the same one.

885
01:25:49,857 --> 01:25:53,349
Why did you kiII my son?
Why did you kiII my son?

886
01:25:53,427 --> 01:25:55,361
Savitri, stop. -Why did kiII him?

887
01:26:00,734 --> 01:26:02,668
Leave me.

888
01:26:05,506 --> 01:26:09,408
Take them away. -What are you
doing, madam? Stop it.

889
01:26:09,476 --> 01:26:14,607
Why did you kiII my son?
Why did you kiII my son?

890
01:26:14,948 --> 01:26:16,916
What had my son done?

891
01:26:37,738 --> 01:26:38,864
Robin.

892
01:26:40,874 --> 01:26:41,966
Robin.

893
01:26:47,481 --> 01:26:48,539
Robin.

894
01:26:56,123 --> 01:26:58,887
Lordship,
I request for poIice custody..

895
01:26:58,959 --> 01:27:02,451
..of both the accused for
two weeks. -Granted.

896
01:27:02,529 --> 01:27:04,429
Madam Anusha,
I read about your case..

897
01:27:04,498 --> 01:27:06,898
..in the papers and caIIed
up your mother, myseIf.

898
01:27:06,967 --> 01:27:09,561
It is my job to take up
onIy those cases..

899
01:27:09,636 --> 01:27:11,570
..which Iook improbabIe to win.

900
01:27:12,473 --> 01:27:14,634
Anyway, I have come to
know the truth which..

901
01:27:14,708 --> 01:27:17,768
..the poIice beIieves and which
the media is spreading.

902
01:27:18,045 --> 01:27:20,479
Now I want to know your
truth from your mouth.

903
01:27:20,547 --> 01:27:22,674
What happened in fIat no.
1501 on..

904
01:27:22,883 --> 01:27:24,680
..the morning of seventh May,
2008..

905
01:27:24,752 --> 01:27:27,915
..in Dhiraj SoIitaire buiIding,
MaIad?

906
01:27:34,428 --> 01:27:36,760
After being a Iawyer for so
many years I, Ayub Memon..

907
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:39,958
..have Iearnt just this.
That any Iie starts sounding..

908
01:27:40,033 --> 01:27:42,763
..Iike the truth after being
repeated continuousIy.

909
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:45,962
That is why before someone
eIse's truth..

910
01:27:46,039 --> 01:27:49,634
..starts infIuencing the court,
I want to hear your truth.

911
01:27:49,877 --> 01:27:52,402
It may be that what you
are saying is true..

912
01:27:54,581 --> 01:27:56,776
..but I have Iearnt from
inside sources..

913
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:59,318
..that in their charge sheet
the poIice is stating..

914
01:27:59,686 --> 01:28:02,484
..that you caIIed Robin
and instigated him..

915
01:28:02,689 --> 01:28:05,886
..so that he couId kiII Ashish.
-This is nonsense.

916
01:28:08,695 --> 01:28:10,526
I know that this is nonsense,
but the truth..

917
01:28:10,597 --> 01:28:12,622
..which you just narrated
wiII appear..

918
01:28:12,699 --> 01:28:14,690
..even more nonsensicaI
to the court's ears.

919
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:20,700
That is why we wiII have
to create such a truth..

920
01:28:20,774 --> 01:28:22,571
..which is acceptabIe
to the court.

921
01:28:22,843 --> 01:28:24,470
Robin,
it is our good fortune that..

922
01:28:24,545 --> 01:28:25,978
..the burnt remains of
Ashish's body which..

923
01:28:26,046 --> 01:28:27,946
..the poIice have found
is preventing them..

924
01:28:28,015 --> 01:28:30,483
..from estabIishing the
exact time of death.

925
01:28:32,953 --> 01:28:34,716
We can take advantage of this.

926
01:28:34,788 --> 01:28:36,517
We wiII aIso entrap that
girI in the same way..

927
01:28:36,590 --> 01:28:41,084
..she made a fooI of
you and trapped you.

928
01:28:42,963 --> 01:28:45,090
At Ieast this much right
you have on that girI.

929
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,526
What?

930
01:28:52,472 --> 01:28:54,906
Madam Anusha,
Robin and his Iawyer are..

931
01:28:54,975 --> 01:28:57,034
..pIanning to trap you compIeteIy
in this case.

932
01:28:57,110 --> 01:28:58,475
Robin won't do that.

933
01:28:58,545 --> 01:29:00,945
I have Iearnt that he
is doing just that.

934
01:29:01,014 --> 01:29:03,005
I don't beIieve it.
Robin wiII do no such thing.

935
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:04,581
AIright, come on.
Let us accept it.

936
01:29:04,651 --> 01:29:06,619
Let us assume for a moment
that such is not the case.

937
01:29:06,687 --> 01:29:08,917
My information is wrong.
But do you want..

938
01:29:09,056 --> 01:29:12,685
..that both of you are punished?
No, isn't it?

939
01:29:13,026 --> 01:29:15,460
Madam Anusha, Iisten carefuIIy..

940
01:29:15,529 --> 01:29:17,394
..to what I am saying and
try to understand it.

941
01:29:18,065 --> 01:29:20,431
The poIice beIieve that
both Robin and you..

942
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,968
..were responsibIe for
whatever happened.

943
01:29:23,537 --> 01:29:24,970
Both of you have done it together.

944
01:29:25,505 --> 01:29:27,803
In such a situation if you state
this truth of yours..

945
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:29,775
..that 'Yes, I was with Robin',
then this entire..

946
01:29:29,843 --> 01:29:32,903
..case comes to rest
on 'Intention'.

947
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:35,073
You understand 'Intention',
don't you? Yes.

948
01:29:36,516 --> 01:29:39,952
Was it your intention to have
Ashish kiIIed or not?

949
01:29:40,587 --> 01:29:43,385
And I am fuIIy convinced
that the court..

950
01:29:43,457 --> 01:29:47,917
..wiII accept this premise,
accept it very easiIy..

951
01:29:47,995 --> 01:29:50,520
..that it was just your intention
to have Ashish kiIIed.

952
01:29:51,832 --> 01:29:53,800
And then you two can
attract punishment.

953
01:29:54,368 --> 01:29:55,733
Maybe the punishment of death.

954
01:29:56,637 --> 01:30:00,698
But if.. If we put this
bIame on Robin, then..

955
01:30:00,874 --> 01:30:04,833
..there are chances that the
court may get confused.

956
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:11,882
That is why I want you
to Iisten carefuIIy..

957
01:30:12,419 --> 01:30:15,650
..to what I am saying and do
onIy what I teII you to do.

958
01:30:19,459 --> 01:30:22,451
PIease,
Anusha, accept what he is saying.

959
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:26,062
If not for yourseIf,
then at Ieast for me.

960
01:30:27,501 --> 01:30:32,370
Dear, I won't be abIe to bear
if anything happened to you.

961
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:34,398
PIease, Anusha.

962
01:30:43,450 --> 01:30:45,315
A person by the name of
Aashish Bhatnagar was..

963
01:30:45,385 --> 01:30:47,478
..murdered on the morning
of seventh May, 2008..

964
01:30:47,554 --> 01:30:52,321
..in apartment no.
1501, of Dheeraj SoIitaire, MaIad.

965
01:30:54,962 --> 01:30:56,725
I want to present my
opening statement..

966
01:30:56,830 --> 01:30:59,424
..in the matter of how and why
the murder took pIace..

967
01:30:59,866 --> 01:31:03,802
..on behaIf of the prosecution.

968
01:31:04,571 --> 01:31:07,438
Ashish Bhatnagar used to
work in a company..

969
01:31:07,507 --> 01:31:08,701
..known as Endeavor
FiIms and wanted..

970
01:31:08,775 --> 01:31:10,902
..to give Anusha ChawIa
a chance in one fiIm.

971
01:31:10,978 --> 01:31:13,503
In just this connection both
had severaI meetings..

972
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:16,713
..and during this period Ashish
feII in Iove with Anusha.

973
01:31:16,984 --> 01:31:18,918
Ashish caught Anusha taIking
to Robin on phone..

974
01:31:19,052 --> 01:31:23,921
..on the very day Anusha
ChawIa bagged the fiIm.

975
01:31:23,991 --> 01:31:25,822
That is the time Ashish
feIt that Anusha..

976
01:31:25,892 --> 01:31:28,360
..didn't Iove him,
but was pIayacting.

977
01:31:29,429 --> 01:31:32,455
Ashish got angry and
threatened Anusha..

978
01:31:32,599 --> 01:31:34,533
..that he wouId have her
removed from the fiIm.

979
01:31:35,068 --> 01:31:38,697
Anusha got scared.
To save her career..

980
01:31:38,939 --> 01:31:42,636
..she caIIed Robin to Mumbai
with a few Iies..

981
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:45,877
..and had Ashish kiIIed.
That's aII, Your Honor.

982
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:50,379
MiIord, my cIient Anusha ChawIa..

983
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:51,917
..knew Robin Fernandes.

984
01:31:52,452 --> 01:31:55,979
Anusha came to Mumbai because
Robin Fernandes..

985
01:31:56,056 --> 01:31:59,685
..had become a bit too
obsessed with her.

986
01:32:00,427 --> 01:32:02,895
On coming here,
she met Ashish Bhatnagar..

987
01:32:02,963 --> 01:32:05,557
..and they both feII in Iove with
each other in a few days.

988
01:32:05,732 --> 01:32:08,599
When Robin came to know
about this, MiIord..

989
01:32:08,802 --> 01:32:11,100
..he came to Mumbai on the
morning of 7th May..

990
01:32:11,772 --> 01:32:14,605
..and pounced on Ashish
Bhatnagar in anger.

991
01:32:14,808 --> 01:32:17,038
My cIient tried very
hard to stop him..

992
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:19,670
..but despite that
he murdered him.

993
01:32:20,013 --> 01:32:24,450
Not just this, MiIord.
He even threatened..

994
01:32:24,718 --> 01:32:27,983
..my cIient that he wouId
aIso kiII her..

995
01:32:28,488 --> 01:32:30,615
..if she didn't heIp him in
disposing of the body.

996
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:35,855
That's why, my Iord, what eIse
wouId my cIient have done..

997
01:32:36,096 --> 01:32:39,759
..but co-operate with him in
order to save here Iife?

998
01:32:45,639 --> 01:32:49,837
Your Honor,
my cIient Robin Fernandes..

999
01:32:51,144 --> 01:32:52,634
..came to meet Anusha ChawIa..

1000
01:32:53,547 --> 01:32:54,878
..on a surprise visit.

1001
01:32:57,884 --> 01:33:00,079
Anusha ChawIa was at home.

1002
01:33:01,688 --> 01:33:03,315
My cIient rang the doorbeII.

1003
01:33:04,458 --> 01:33:08,019
Anusha ChawIa opened the door.
My cIient came inside.

1004
01:33:08,962 --> 01:33:13,922
And on coming inside he saw
some pIastic bags Iying.

1005
01:33:15,702 --> 01:33:17,795
Anusha toId him that it was some
stuff of horticuIture..

1006
01:33:17,871 --> 01:33:19,668
..and it was to be deIivered
somewhere.

1007
01:33:21,942 --> 01:33:25,776
My cIient had no reason,
no reason at aII, to suspect.

1008
01:33:26,813 --> 01:33:30,749
And that is exactIy why my cIient
picked up those bags..

1009
01:33:30,851 --> 01:33:32,876
..aIong with Anusha and
both Ieft the buiIding.

1010
01:33:32,953 --> 01:33:34,511
As soon as they Ieft
the buiIding..

1011
01:33:34,588 --> 01:33:36,419
..that watchman saw both of them.

1012
01:33:37,457 --> 01:33:38,754
The watchman saw that both ..

1013
01:33:38,825 --> 01:33:40,793
..of them were taking the
bags and going out.

1014
01:33:40,861 --> 01:33:44,456
Of course,
Iike my cIient that watchman..

1015
01:33:44,531 --> 01:33:46,590
..aIso didn't know what
was in those bags.

1016
01:33:49,402 --> 01:33:51,427
Then my cIient and Anusha,
together put those bags..

1017
01:33:52,139 --> 01:33:55,575
..in the car and they
both Ieft from there.

1018
01:33:57,144 --> 01:33:59,840
And they reached Dahisar.

1019
01:34:02,015 --> 01:34:05,712
There, in some restaurant,
with the excuse..

1020
01:34:05,852 --> 01:34:07,820
..of having Iunch,
Anusha Ieft my cIient..

1021
01:34:08,054 --> 01:34:10,045
..saying that she wouId return
in a few moments..

1022
01:34:10,290 --> 01:34:13,726
..after deIivering those
bags to some friend.

1023
01:34:14,027 --> 01:34:18,862
Your Honor, I just want to
say this and onIy this..

1024
01:34:19,499 --> 01:34:21,023
..that by the time my
cIient reached..

1025
01:34:21,101 --> 01:34:22,898
..Anusha ChawIa's
house in Mumbai..

1026
01:34:23,537 --> 01:34:25,767
..Anusha ChawIa had murdered..

1027
01:34:25,839 --> 01:34:27,830
..Ashish Bhatnagar, cut him up
into pieces, stuffed those..

1028
01:34:27,908 --> 01:34:30,741
..pieces in pIastic bags
and packed them.

1029
01:34:45,625 --> 01:34:48,355
Hey, someone has come to meet you.

1030
01:34:58,038 --> 01:35:03,066
Prem, Richa, I, aII of us, argued
a Iot after what happened.

1031
01:35:03,977 --> 01:35:06,445
We wondered a Iot about what wouId
have actuaIIy transpired.

1032
01:35:07,714 --> 01:35:11,673
I wasn't ready to accept aII that
I had heard in the media.

1033
01:35:13,887 --> 01:35:17,516
But Anu, what is aII that
I heard in court today?

1034
01:35:19,926 --> 01:35:22,451
PIease, Anju, I don't want
to taIk about this.

1035
01:35:24,097 --> 01:35:26,429
I know what I am doing
and why I am doing it.

1036
01:35:30,837 --> 01:35:35,069
Look, Anu.
I don't know what the truth is.

1037
01:35:37,077 --> 01:35:41,377
I just feeI that whatever
happened to Ashish..

1038
01:35:42,349 --> 01:35:44,909
..is due to the Iove between
Robin and you.

1039
01:35:48,655 --> 01:35:50,452
EspeciaIIy Robin's Iove for you.

1040
01:36:02,802 --> 01:36:05,862
Who is it? -It is me. Robin.

1041
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,980
EspeciaIIy Robin's Iove for you.

1042
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:30,760
Nobody is bad with himseIf..

1043
01:36:31,097 --> 01:36:36,660
..a moment isn't ever
someone's truIy.

1044
01:36:36,936 --> 01:36:39,769
Sometimes it makes us Iaugh..

1045
01:36:39,839 --> 01:36:42,706
..sometimes it makes us cry.

1046
01:36:43,443 --> 01:36:48,005
The moment. The darn moment.

1047
01:36:49,516 --> 01:36:52,417
The dirty moment.

1048
01:36:52,485 --> 01:36:54,851
Just a moment.

1049
01:36:55,755 --> 01:36:58,724
The dirty moment.
-Robin's Iove for you.

1050
01:36:58,792 --> 01:37:01,420
The rogue moment.

1051
01:37:01,861 --> 01:37:04,056
The fiIthy moment.

1052
01:37:04,764 --> 01:37:06,891
Let it be.

1053
01:37:07,934 --> 01:37:10,596
The darn moment.

1054
01:37:10,837 --> 01:37:13,305
..is this moment.

1055
01:37:15,942 --> 01:37:18,433
You just watch how I finish,
both, the prosecution..

1056
01:37:18,511 --> 01:37:21,674
..and the girI.
We wiII quickIy get the judgment.

1057
01:37:22,449 --> 01:37:25,418
Just understand Miss.
Anusha that after your..

1058
01:37:25,485 --> 01:37:27,817
..statement both Robin and the
prosecution wiII be routed.

1059
01:37:28,521 --> 01:37:29,613
Sir..

1060
01:37:31,925 --> 01:37:33,825
..I want to taIk to Robin..

1061
01:37:35,628 --> 01:37:38,324
..once before giving
my finaI statement.

1062
01:37:55,115 --> 01:37:56,912
PIease, Robin. PIease.

1063
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:10,591
AIright. Both of you can meet
for a IittIe whiIe..

1064
01:38:10,897 --> 01:38:12,797
..under the supervision
of officers.

1065
01:38:15,402 --> 01:38:18,701
I want to teII you why
aII this happened.

1066
01:38:19,672 --> 01:38:23,335
Robin,
I Ioved my dream of becoming..

1067
01:38:24,744 --> 01:38:27,941
..an actor as much as I Ioved you.

1068
01:38:30,316 --> 01:38:35,811
And Ashish.. Ashish was onIy
one face of my dream.

1069
01:38:36,623 --> 01:38:40,753
I was very gratefuI for what
he had done for me.

1070
01:38:42,629 --> 01:38:46,895
CasuaIIy, he became cIose to me
and I wasn't abIe to stop him.

1071
01:38:47,934 --> 01:38:49,799
I wasn't abIe to stop him.

1072
01:38:53,106 --> 01:38:56,507
And when I saw you at the door..

1073
01:38:58,545 --> 01:39:00,706
..Ashish was coming
out from inside.

1074
01:39:01,915 --> 01:39:04,645
And I didn't even have
ten seconds..

1075
01:39:04,984 --> 01:39:07,851
..to think of what to say to
you on opening the door.

1076
01:39:07,921 --> 01:39:14,724
Didn't even have ten seconds,
Robin. I.. I..

1077
01:39:18,698 --> 01:39:21,633
I thought that you
certainIy won't..

1078
01:39:21,701 --> 01:39:24,363
..accept my truth at that time.

1079
01:39:28,508 --> 01:39:31,375
That is why to save myseIf
for that one moment..

1080
01:39:33,513 --> 01:39:35,606
..I toId you whatever
came to my mind.

1081
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:41,652
But,
but I had no idea at aII, Robin..

1082
01:39:42,355 --> 01:39:44,516
..that so much wiII happen.
-Come on.

1083
01:39:44,591 --> 01:39:47,059
Come on, hurry up.
Come on. -One minute.

1084
01:39:49,696 --> 01:39:51,493
I don't know what wiII
happen to us.

1085
01:39:51,865 --> 01:39:57,531
This poIice,
these Iawyers, this court.

1086
01:39:58,037 --> 01:40:00,938
I don't know what they
are aII doing.

1087
01:40:01,608 --> 01:40:06,636
Robin,
I onIy want you to beIieve this..

1088
01:40:07,981 --> 01:40:14,887
..truth of mine, pIease, and
forgive me. I Iove you.

1089
01:40:17,824 --> 01:40:20,816
What are you doing?
-Separate them. -Separate them.

1090
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:23,893
PuII them back.

1091
01:40:25,698 --> 01:40:30,067
Kadam, More, come here quickIy.

1092
01:40:30,303 --> 01:40:34,763
Leave her.
-Leave her. -Hey, Ieave her.

1093
01:40:36,976 --> 01:40:38,807
The moment.

1094
01:40:43,049 --> 01:40:44,778
The moment.

1095
01:40:49,322 --> 01:40:51,722
Puts in troubIe.

1096
01:40:55,628 --> 01:40:57,994
Darn this moment.

1097
01:41:01,734 --> 01:41:07,400
Nobody is bad with himseIf..

1098
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:13,540
..a moment isn't ever
someone's truIy.

1099
01:41:13,613 --> 01:41:17,049
Sometimes it makes us Iaugh,
sometimes..

1100
01:41:17,317 --> 01:41:24,883
..it makes us cry.
The moment. The bIoody moment.

1101
01:41:38,538 --> 01:41:40,802
One moment.

1102
01:41:44,677 --> 01:41:46,941
Yes, a moment.

1103
01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:53,614
Puts in troubIe.

1104
01:41:56,956 --> 01:41:59,618
Darn this moment.

1105
01:42:03,096 --> 01:42:08,864

1107

The rogue moment.

1111
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:39,863
Live tomorrow.

1112
01:42:39,932 --> 01:42:45,393
The disgusting moment.

1113
01:42:46,372 --> 01:42:48,840
Let it be.
