1
00:00:07,513 --> 00:00:09,632
Consumption of alcohol isinjurious to health.

2
00:00:09,712 --> 00:00:12,173
Smoking causes cancerand leads to death.

3
00:00:12,253 --> 00:00:15,308
Cigarette smoking and alcoholconsumption are injurious to health.

4
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:16,843
It causes cancer.

5
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:21,480
Thirty years ago we tried once Vinda...

6
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:22,564
But failed.

7
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:24,980
Now... luck is on our side.

8
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:28,522
Your son... this morning...and now... it's you.

9
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:31,439
It's time for your company's logoto change, Vinda.

10
00:04:32,327 --> 00:04:36,189
Your heirless business empireis now ours.

11
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:44,647
Why is he laughing?

12
00:05:27,272 --> 00:05:29,230
Here are the belongings...

13
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:32,647
Mr. Vinda's... and your son's.

14
00:05:33,272 --> 00:05:35,105
We just got it.

15
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:42,439
I thought...I should hand it over personally.

16
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:44,439
I appreciate it.

17
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:45,814
Thank you.

18
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:21,647
'Thirty years ago we tried once Vinda...'

19
00:06:21,897 --> 00:06:23,105
'But failed.'

20
00:06:24,064 --> 00:06:26,105
'Now... luck is on our side.'

21
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:29,147
'Your son... this morning...and now... it's you.'

22
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:32,605
'It's time for your company's logoto change, Vinda.'

23
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:37,439
'Your heirless business empireis now ours.'

24
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:00,942
Hello.

25
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:02,772
I have two names with me.

26
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,230
Ask him to step out.

27
00:07:06,522 --> 00:07:11,022
Many years ago, on a rainy day like this,Vinda had left him.

28
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:14,147
After all these years,you are calling for him, now.

29
00:07:14,355 --> 00:07:16,730
I'll inform him...certainly I will.

30
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,272
Hello...

31
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:21,064
Hey...

32
00:07:21,314 --> 00:07:22,272
Where is he?

33
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:25,189
Sir went to Thanau yesterday,I'll find out and let you know.

34
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:26,567
Ok, find out quickly.

35
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:27,605
Ok sir.

36
00:07:33,564 --> 00:07:34,772
Chotu!

37
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,272
Chotu!

38
00:07:57,397 --> 00:07:58,689
Hello!

39
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:09,855
Hello... Give him the phone.- Ok mother.

40
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:08,272
Sir... phone.

41
00:13:38,022 --> 00:13:40,772
The leading force in the pharma,steel and infra industries,

42
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:44,314
AB Group Founder and CEOGovinda Bhargav known as Vinda

00:13:44,397 --> 00:13:45,942
Has died at the age of 67.

44
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:48,605
Vinda was found dead outsideLe Fonti Grand Hotel, Siena, Itlay.

45
00:13:48,814 --> 00:13:50,785
Sticking with our breakingnews on the shocking and sudden death

46
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:52,525
of AB Group founder and CEO

47
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:53,647
Mr. Govinda Bhargav

48
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:55,162
Tributes are pouring in from world leaders,

49
00:13:55,242 --> 00:13:56,939
business competitorsand ordinary people alike.

50
00:13:57,022 --> 00:13:59,692
Just moments ago AB Group hasput out a statement saying,

51
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:03,897
Quote "AB Group has lost a great visionary,a loving CEO and an inspiring leader

52
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:06,147
and the world has lost a wonderfulhuman being

53
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:07,554
We shall continue to march forward

54
00:14:07,634 --> 00:14:09,689
on the path laid byour dear leader" Unquote.

55
00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:11,105
Quiet please.

56
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:13,939
Due to the sudden demiseof our beloved CEO

57
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:17,067
The interim CEO will beSmt. Indrani Bhargav

58
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,486
All your questions will be answered...may be later

59
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,022
Thank you, Thank you.

60
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:06,397
'Thirty years ago we tried once Vinda...'

61
00:15:06,564 --> 00:15:07,355
'But failed.'

62
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:09,272
'Now... luck is on our side.'

63
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:11,980
'Your son... this morning...and now... it's you.'

64
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:17,314
The first voice is Sharma's...

65
00:15:17,855 --> 00:15:19,314
The second is Varma's.

66
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:21,980
Must kill them both.

67
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,480
I only doubt them now...

68
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:27,689
I should know it's the truth.

69
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:30,439
I must feel it so strongly that...

70
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:34,314
Even throwing them both fromthe edge of that building

71
00:15:34,564 --> 00:15:36,355
I should feel it's justified.

72
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:51,064
But we must confirm somethingbefore that.

73
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:55,439
That night when they killed my dad,whose phone were they using?

74
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:57,355
Varma's or Sharma's?

75
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:00,022
Whose call list is registeredwith an international call?

76
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,105
If it was Sharma's,this is his office.

77
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:06,730
No wife... no kids... no habits...no illicit affairs...nothing.

78
00:16:07,522 --> 00:16:10,855
His every detail is on his desktop.

79
00:16:11,272 --> 00:16:13,897
If that is hacked, we will find allthe telephone records on his iCloud

80
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:16,268
If there is a single international callin the outgoing list

81
00:16:16,348 --> 00:16:17,980
on 12th March midnight...

82
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:20,064
If so... you will kill him?

83
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:34,730
Look at this chair...

84
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,772
A green, live tree is axed...

85
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:40,564
Sawed into pieces...

86
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,564
Its bark sharpened with a blade...

87
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,480
And a number of nailsare driven into its whole body.

88
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,022
There is a lot of violencebehind the chair we sit in!

89
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:58,230
Behind every little comfortwe seek in life,

90
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,605
There is a mini war.

91
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:09,314
Even I need some comfort.

92
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:12,939
I have to get rid of the anger on thosewho killed my father and younger brother.

93
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:15,564
I should be able to laugh easily.

94
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:19,397
For that comfort, if a war is necessary,

95
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:21,605
We shall wage one.

96
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:25,064
Certainly, we shall.

97
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:38,105
So, our motto is to kill them both...

98
00:17:38,564 --> 00:17:39,814
We must be happy.

99
00:17:41,189 --> 00:17:43,522
Let's kill them, Sir.- They are too young. Don't ruin them.

100
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:45,647
Come on, uncle.

101
00:17:47,147 --> 00:17:49,363
If I need the call datafrom Sharma's computer,

102
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,730
I must enter his office.

103
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:54,855
More than 30 floors...500 exits, exhausts, ducts...

104
00:17:55,022 --> 00:17:56,730
Oh... we can plan.

105
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:58,647
In ten or fifteen days...we can step inside.

106
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:00,689
What do you mean?How can you decide on the time?

107
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:01,647
Won't he be offended?

108
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:03,230
He may have only a week on his mind.

109
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:06,105
How long do you consider, sir?

110
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:08,647
It's 9.30 now, right?- Yes.

111
00:18:08,814 --> 00:18:09,897
By 11 O' clock if it's ready, it's fine.

112
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,272
One and half hour?!

113
00:18:11,352 --> 00:18:12,564
Why, is it too long?

114
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:14,855
Sir... that's enough.- Uncle...

115
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:16,734
To get into someone's house...there should be a wedding...

116
00:18:16,814 --> 00:18:18,314
And to get into someone's office...there should be an interview.

117
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:20,855
Today, there is a interview forPersonal Assistant post

118
00:18:21,228 --> 00:18:22,897
People are standing in a queue...

119
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:25,730
Won't I find someone tohelp me sneak inside.

120
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:28,480
Bring him.

121
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:35,480
You have changed the venue?

122
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:40,105
The candidates will be disturbed by police,who are here for Vinda's death.

123
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,897
But I can't find any sign board?!

124
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:43,522
It's over there.

125
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:45,064
Sorry.

126
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,439
I didn't notice it.

127
00:18:47,355 --> 00:18:49,980
I couldn't find my own interview cardin the first place. Let's go.

128
00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:51,775
Why don't we take these poor guys along?

129
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:54,314
Do we take another boy to the first night?- No!

130
00:18:54,397 --> 00:18:55,480
No way. We go in first.

131
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:56,897
We'll share later. You come alone.

132
00:18:57,105 --> 00:18:58,741
Come. Come.- Just a moment.

133
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:10,980
This is the new venue.

134
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:15,564
Give me your entry cards and certificates.

135
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:17,814
I will get you a placementwithout fail after a month.

136
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:20,314
You will get me a job?- Yes...

137
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:21,897
For me?- Yup.

138
00:19:22,397 --> 00:19:23,022
Fine.

139
00:19:23,272 --> 00:19:24,480
But what do I do this whole month?

140
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,480
You can have a paid holiday.

141
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,314
Or there's another option.- What's that?

142
00:19:28,397 --> 00:19:30,775
I am an old-timer and I caution you...the first option is the best.

143
00:19:30,855 --> 00:19:33,105
I am a new-timer and I request you...don't tell me what is better for me.

144
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:34,105
Let me decide.

145
00:19:34,314 --> 00:19:36,814
I must know what the second option is.I insist. - Your bad luck.

146
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:40,442
I thought a person can wear a tie but nowI know a person can be tied with a tie too!

147
00:19:40,522 --> 00:19:41,480
Isn't it?

148
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:43,564
I think the first option is better.

149
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:44,692
Thanks, bro.

150
00:19:44,772 --> 00:19:46,814
Good. Untie me and I shall go my way.

151
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:49,442
Once you see the second option...your right to choose the first option....

152
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,022
Is automatically lost.

153
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:52,897
But you didn't tell me this earlier...

154
00:19:53,522 --> 00:19:54,605
Uncle...

155
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:56,355
120 people have appeared forthe interview.

156
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,772
Is it? Really?

157
00:19:57,852 --> 00:19:59,109
I have seen them myself.

158
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:01,900
Hello! I ask you something,and you are talking among yourselves!

159
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,939
Answer me first.- That was the answer man!

160
00:20:04,314 --> 00:20:05,147
Hey...

161
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:09,956
Why did we prefer you to 119 others?

162
00:20:10,036 --> 00:20:12,189
Why did you select me?

163
00:20:13,064 --> 00:20:13,900
Oh no.

164
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,855
It's a trap!- Yes bro!

165
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:17,230
Smart idiot!

166
00:20:27,064 --> 00:20:28,105
Bye, bro.

167
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:29,105
Enjoy.

168
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:30,525
What's happening?

169
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:31,855
Not from the ladies...- Ok.

170
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,814
Steal from him.- Ok.

171
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:39,105
Walk fast. It may close.

172
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:42,189
Gadde Varma.- Sir.

173
00:20:42,397 --> 00:20:43,189
Is this yours?

174
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:44,272
Yes, sir.

175
00:20:44,564 --> 00:20:46,272
It's safer around your neck.- Thank you sir.

176
00:20:46,397 --> 00:20:48,775
We can't get in or get out without it,can we?

177
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:50,772
What do you say?- Correct

178
00:20:53,522 --> 00:20:55,022
First floor maintenance.

179
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:57,230
This is a very powerful microphone.

180
00:20:57,355 --> 00:20:58,730
I am placing this in the chocolate.

181
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:01,105
You must carry this tothe interview room. - Sure.

182
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:02,025
Ok?

183
00:21:02,105 --> 00:21:04,605
I will be listening to their questionsthrough this.

184
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,480
Wear this bluetooth.

185
00:21:07,022 --> 00:21:09,855
I will transmit the answersto their questions. You simply repeat.

186
00:21:10,064 --> 00:21:11,230
Clear?- Clear.

187
00:21:27,022 --> 00:21:28,439
Hey, Shivashankar!

188
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,980
What?- See this?

189
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:32,105
What business do I have with it?- You don't... I do.

190
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:39,772
It stopped.

191
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:42,355
Be careful... Be careful...don't worry...

192
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:43,480
Don't drop these applications.

193
00:21:44,022 --> 00:21:45,689
Can anybody help me please?- It's open.

194
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:46,939
Don't panic.

195
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:48,564
Sir, pull me up.

196
00:21:48,647 --> 00:21:50,397
Sir, pull me up first.- Wait... one by one.

197
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:51,105
One by one.

198
00:21:52,147 --> 00:21:53,355
Sir pull me up.- First give me those applications

199
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:54,234
Why have them in your hands?

200
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,775
Please be very careful thoseare interview files.- Hold these.

201
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:57,195
Sir, please pull me up.- I'll help you.

202
00:21:58,397 --> 00:21:59,942
Why are you getting so tensedabout the files.

203
00:22:00,022 --> 00:22:01,730
They are not more important than life.

204
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:03,147
Oh no!

205
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,105
I'm pulling you.

206
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:06,439
Is it done?

207
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:07,939
Job's done.

208
00:22:09,272 --> 00:22:12,189
That's why elders always advise to usethe stairs to go up in life.. not the lift.

209
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:13,439
Thank you, sir.- Ok.

210
00:22:14,355 --> 00:22:16,772
The rabbits are playfully movingThe lion can come happily.

211
00:22:24,814 --> 00:22:27,355
He is seeking a job in his own office!

212
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,227
Absolutely no tension. The job is yours.

213
00:22:59,307 --> 00:23:00,019
Thank you so much, sir.

214
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:02,057
I gave you such sweet news!Not even a sweet for me?

215
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:04,099
Excuse me...- Sure.

216
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,717
He is our --- Sir.

217
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:07,241
Take chocolate sir.

218
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:08,932
You know the formalities.

219
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,807
Along with the check in the evening,don't bring chocolates.

220
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,557
My wife doesn't like them.Bring sweets.

221
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:14,724
I didn't have my breakfast yet.

222
00:23:15,391 --> 00:23:16,099
Sorry, bro.

223
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,724
I thought he would take one.But he took them all.

224
00:23:17,849 --> 00:23:19,141
Worked out for you perfectly, right?- Yes.

225
00:23:19,224 --> 00:23:20,690
Get going.- Thank you, bro.

226
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:23,807
Hey, Toffees are in.

227
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,057
Excuse me, sir. Bluetooth.- Sure.

228
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:33,099
Plan B.

229
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:39,224
What is the effect of GSTon manufacturing states?

230
00:23:43,141 --> 00:23:43,766
Sir...

231
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:47,849
This guy fails to answer one question andthe job should be given to my candidate.

232
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:52,602
Yeah!

233
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:55,391
Because of GST,Sir... actually speaking...

234
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:58,016
They started it in 2012...

235
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:00,224
The UPA government has started it...

236
00:24:00,304 --> 00:24:02,474
The kind of benefits from it are...Most importantly...

237
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,682
One second... one second...

238
00:24:21,016 --> 00:24:24,557
Whatever we ask... why do youlook down and answer?

239
00:24:27,974 --> 00:24:30,557
I am unnerved by the powerin your eyes, Sir.

240
00:24:30,641 --> 00:24:31,932
That's why I am looking down.

241
00:24:33,016 --> 00:24:34,557
How much salary are you expecting?

242
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,266
So, you have already offered the job!Now, what should I tell that fellow?

243
00:24:39,474 --> 00:24:40,932
For now, this chocolate will suffice, sir.

244
00:24:41,432 --> 00:24:42,724
Chocolate?- Chocolate?

245
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,766
This chocolate in enough.

246
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:51,182
Smells like cigarettes.

247
00:25:04,724 --> 00:25:05,682
Excuse me.

248
00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:25,932
Stomach upset?

249
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:30,099
Oh it is heart-ache.

250
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:36,932
Which department do you work in?

251
00:25:41,141 --> 00:25:43,391
Suryakantham... Personal Department.

252
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:45,932
Secretary to Ajay Sharma...

253
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:48,599
In this the first voice is Sharma's

254
00:25:48,888 --> 00:25:50,557
and the second voice is Varma's

255
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:54,807
Hi! Nice meeting you...!

256
00:25:55,016 --> 00:25:55,807
You too.

257
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,682
Did Sharma scold you?

258
00:26:02,224 --> 00:26:02,974
Then?

259
00:26:13,807 --> 00:26:15,807
It's over... Rohit.

260
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:18,349
Oh... your boyfriend dumped you.

261
00:26:21,974 --> 00:26:23,932
Had you not given the half-million,

262
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,349
I wouldn't have started this business.

263
00:26:26,807 --> 00:26:27,849
Half-million?!

264
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,974
Yes.

265
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:30,807
Where did you get it from?

266
00:26:34,412 --> 00:26:38,099
She has stored all of her informationin iPhone and life history in Google.

267
00:26:42,224 --> 00:26:45,141
Sanctioned salary advance...half a million.

268
00:26:46,182 --> 00:26:47,474
Salary advance?

269
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:50,057
Mr. Sharma is like a father to me.

270
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:52,807
I even lied to himto get the loan.

271
00:26:53,224 --> 00:26:55,766
Without any questionshe has given the money.

272
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,766
I am not able to bear this guilt.

273
00:27:03,286 --> 00:27:05,641
What if that cigarette in your handwas Rohit himself?

274
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:09,016
What will you do?

275
00:27:10,307 --> 00:27:12,974
Come on.... Do it... Do it...Good!

276
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:16,182
That and this guy... both areinjurious to your health.

277
00:27:16,391 --> 00:27:17,682
Take my advice and forget him.

278
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:20,557
Leave him. I will tell youwhat will happen next. Come.

279
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,974
With children going hungryor girls crying incessantly,

280
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:24,432
This country will not prosper.

281
00:27:24,641 --> 00:27:25,474
Smile.

282
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:26,599
Over here.

283
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:28,641
Take it.

284
00:27:30,224 --> 00:27:33,516
What could be a more matchinglipstick to a girl, than a smile?

285
00:27:34,641 --> 00:27:36,016
You smile, first.

286
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:37,752
And you are?

287
00:27:37,932 --> 00:27:40,519
Balasubramanyam, Personal Assistant.Newly recruited.

288
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,516
Oh. So you work under me...

289
00:27:42,932 --> 00:27:45,891
You just let me know 'do it this wayor that way Balasubramanyam',

290
00:27:46,182 --> 00:27:48,141
and I will do it for you.

291
00:27:48,682 --> 00:27:49,936
Come. I'll tell you something.

292
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:06,932
Vinda means a man with Plan B.

293
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,141
He is reputed for making the right decisioneven in the most adverse situation.

294
00:28:12,932 --> 00:28:14,266
We need a person like him.

295
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,974
With power in hand,anyone would take a decision.

296
00:28:18,153 --> 00:28:19,016
What do you say Varma?

297
00:28:19,212 --> 00:28:22,474
To spend four cents, we need to buyan application form for eight cents.

298
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:26,352
Vinda would buy the form for a rupeeand attribute 75 paise to charity.

299
00:28:26,432 --> 00:28:27,641
That's the beauty.

300
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:30,016
Vinda is a common man like you.

301
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,016
But his ambition...

302
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:37,641
is much bigger like the evening shadow.

303
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:46,266
That's why even intelligentand strong people like you...

304
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:48,849
preferred standing behind him.

305
00:28:50,016 --> 00:28:53,557
For him to control you, are you dogs?!

306
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:54,807
How dare you--

307
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,186
You are tigers.

308
00:28:58,266 --> 00:28:59,766
Let's not make it personal.

309
00:29:01,926 --> 00:29:06,974
All of you have been with himsince the inception of the AB Group.

310
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:11,099
Of course, Mr. Deenabandhuand Mr. Aditya are no more.

311
00:29:11,655 --> 00:29:13,307
Mr. Deenabandhu's son...

312
00:29:13,688 --> 00:29:15,516
Is never actively involved in all this;

313
00:29:15,974 --> 00:29:18,516
So he is not here for the meeting.

314
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:21,891
It has not even been a month,since Vinda has died.

315
00:29:22,736 --> 00:29:28,099
It's not fair to ask her to call fora General Body Meeting right now.

316
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:30,141
Let's take some time.

317
00:29:30,324 --> 00:29:31,349
How long?

318
00:29:31,891 --> 00:29:33,266
We need some clarity.

319
00:29:33,346 --> 00:29:34,807
Let us say one month.

320
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:38,266
Alright.

321
00:29:38,516 --> 00:29:40,182
By that time, let's elect our new CEO.

322
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:43,807
By then... what is thatDeenabandhu's son's name again?

323
00:29:43,891 --> 00:29:44,849
Seetaram.

324
00:29:44,932 --> 00:29:46,349
Damn...

325
00:29:46,557 --> 00:29:48,349
We can't even abuse him,that's a divine name.

326
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,599
Make arrangements for his coming here.

327
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:52,724
Who knows which part of the worldhe has gotten drunk and passed out in?

328
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,682
Start now, and you will find himin a month.

329
00:29:55,372 --> 00:29:56,594
Kalyani...

330
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,057
Priyanka...!

331
00:30:02,518 --> 00:30:04,932
She has her face towards me?What to do now? - Good morning, sir.

332
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:06,057
Good morning.

333
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:09,766
Pen please.

334
00:30:12,266 --> 00:30:13,849
What does this scumbag do?

335
00:30:13,974 --> 00:30:16,474
He is our Personal Manager,Koteswara Rao.

336
00:30:20,974 --> 00:30:22,807
She is Indrani Ma'am.

337
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:32,099
Mr. Vinda's wife.

338
00:31:15,057 --> 00:31:16,224
Just done.

339
00:31:16,766 --> 00:31:19,766
The General Body Meetingmight be in a month.

340
00:31:20,474 --> 00:31:21,807
Is the time sufficient?

341
00:31:22,932 --> 00:31:25,682
Oh... don't worry at all.Within a month.

342
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,932
Rohit will return your money.

343
00:31:28,141 --> 00:31:29,474
Shh... Ma'am.

344
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,516
Oh sorry.

345
00:31:37,016 --> 00:31:38,432
Sir?- Two coffee.

346
00:31:39,118 --> 00:31:40,682
Skimmed milk... no sugar.

347
00:31:40,891 --> 00:31:41,766
How about you, sir?

348
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:45,807
A clean cup with a saucer underneath.

349
00:31:53,057 --> 00:31:54,057
Have you no sense?

350
00:31:54,182 --> 00:31:55,599
Why do you move it?

351
00:32:02,224 --> 00:32:03,266
This is my problem...

352
00:32:03,391 --> 00:32:05,057
Everything should be alignedin a straight line.

353
00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:06,891
Or I just cannot take it.

354
00:32:07,474 --> 00:32:10,266
That's why even Rohit left me.

355
00:32:11,766 --> 00:32:14,974
He would bend his head to kiss me.

356
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:17,807
I would straighten his head.

357
00:32:18,224 --> 00:32:21,724
He would get annoyed thatI wouldn't even let him kiss.

358
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:24,432
This is my problem.

359
00:32:24,766 --> 00:32:25,974
You call this a problem?

360
00:32:27,307 --> 00:32:28,307
Look at him...

361
00:32:28,766 --> 00:32:30,599
He wants everything in a slant line.

362
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,724
Crooked - craziness.- Yes!

363
00:32:33,057 --> 00:32:35,974
Where as you... want everythingin a straight like a ruler.

364
00:32:36,182 --> 00:32:40,099
For illiterates like me to understand,shall we call it scale - craziness?

365
00:32:41,516 --> 00:32:43,224
Somehow, I am happy now.

366
00:32:44,641 --> 00:32:46,724
Why won't you be?I have set the napkin straight, haven't I?

367
00:32:46,974 --> 00:32:48,724
I thought I lost the habit.

368
00:32:49,182 --> 00:32:51,099
Falling at one's feet does notreduce people's temper,

369
00:32:51,182 --> 00:32:52,974
How can one cure diseasesby holding hands, Kantham?

370
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,099
When are we meeting Rohit?

371
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:00,891
You think I am being commercial?

372
00:33:02,266 --> 00:33:03,099
Let's go tomorrow.

373
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:04,932
Balu...

374
00:33:05,141 --> 00:33:06,557
I'll go to the restroom and come.

375
00:33:10,724 --> 00:33:13,266
Why that cozy talk with that girlafter the interview?

376
00:33:13,557 --> 00:33:17,141
I heard she is like a daughter to Sharma.

377
00:33:17,221 --> 00:33:18,016
That's the reason.

378
00:33:18,182 --> 00:33:21,349
Stop thinking about Sharma's daughterand start thinking about Varma.

379
00:33:23,218 --> 00:33:25,057
Even he has an only daughter.

380
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:28,224
Now...- Sir.

381
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:31,849
If Sharma's call data doesn'treflect that night's call.

382
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,016
What should we do then?

383
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:34,266
If not Sharma... it must be Varma.

384
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:36,182
Catch hold of his phoneand you will get his call data.

385
00:33:36,354 --> 00:33:37,849
Absolutely!- Good job...

386
00:33:38,932 --> 00:33:42,016
Instead of trying to enter his housefor the data at that time...

387
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:43,932
If I befriend his daughter...

388
00:33:44,141 --> 00:33:45,141
I can ask her directly.

389
00:33:45,266 --> 00:33:47,141
As if she will tell youimmediately...

390
00:33:47,221 --> 00:33:49,766
Son, our creative levels are already low.

391
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:50,811
Don't think too much.

392
00:33:50,891 --> 00:33:53,099
Fantastic, uncle!That's why I consider you God.

393
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:56,307
When you can't think of anything new,repeat the old!

394
00:33:56,474 --> 00:33:57,307
What do you say?

395
00:33:59,641 --> 00:34:00,932
Idea is very simple.

396
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,311
Whatever happened in the washroomtoday with Suryakantham...

397
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:05,307
Let us repeat the samewith Varma's daughter.

398
00:34:05,766 --> 00:34:07,516
But there is a small change...

399
00:34:08,094 --> 00:34:11,516
Only, I will replace Suryakantham nowand Varma's daughter will be in my place.

400
00:34:11,857 --> 00:34:12,641
How is it?

401
00:34:12,724 --> 00:34:15,273
Wow... Super... fantastic...marvelous...!!!

402
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:16,641
Thank you.

403
00:34:31,468 --> 00:34:32,599
Greetings ma'am...- Greetings.

404
00:34:32,682 --> 00:34:33,852
Seems to have lost the voicein vocal practice.

405
00:34:33,932 --> 00:34:35,519
So she is having milk with pepper.

406
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,724
Not me... my daughter is learning

407
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,474
My husband would scold me ifit is left over... so I am drinking it up.

408
00:34:40,557 --> 00:34:42,349
Why will kids drink milk with pepper?

409
00:34:42,432 --> 00:34:43,932
Whom are you calling a kid, uncle?

410
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:45,849
She was born when'Gharana Mogudu' movie was released.

411
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:47,766
When...?

412
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:49,932
Oh, she is a grown up.- And the name is...

413
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:51,221
Kumari.

414
00:34:53,516 --> 00:34:54,641
Sukumari.

415
00:34:55,546 --> 00:34:57,432
Let's go...You and your dumb acting...

416
00:34:57,516 --> 00:34:59,307
He can listen even if he is dumb.

417
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:02,102
You found it out easily...Not everyone is as smart as you...

418
00:35:02,182 --> 00:35:04,141
You are too much!- Drink it...

419
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:06,391
Whom does she resemble?

420
00:35:06,682 --> 00:35:08,932
A little chubby like me...

421
00:35:09,136 --> 00:35:09,932
You call this chubby?

422
00:35:10,016 --> 00:35:12,141
Probably you would take twospoonfuls more... you look strong.

423
00:35:12,224 --> 00:35:14,182
I know... see this...

424
00:36:49,516 --> 00:36:52,307
Oh! Please don't control your emotions.- Move.

425
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:31,224
Why are you crying looking at me?

426
00:37:31,414 --> 00:37:33,182
Did I not sing in shruthi (tune)?

427
00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:35,266
You sang like Shruthi.

428
00:37:37,912 --> 00:37:39,307
Who is Shruthi?

429
00:37:40,106 --> 00:37:42,807
Imagine a truck crushing a flowerunder its tyres...

430
00:37:43,557 --> 00:37:45,349
That truck is Shruthi.

431
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:47,016
And the flower....

432
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,682
Is my heart.

433
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:54,391
This is what happens whenyou spread flowers on a highway.

434
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:58,891
Moreover, why cry over someonewho deserted you?

435
00:37:59,134 --> 00:38:02,061
Just wash your face and step out...

436
00:38:02,141 --> 00:38:03,599
You will find many girls...

437
00:38:03,901 --> 00:38:06,599
You are tall... you look good...

438
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:09,474
Especially those eyes...

439
00:38:14,974 --> 00:38:16,849
I am Sukumari.

440
00:38:19,004 --> 00:38:21,391
I know it doesn't suit me.

441
00:38:21,557 --> 00:38:23,266
I am Balasubramanyam.

442
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:27,807
I know... I have no connectionto music.

443
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:31,557
What is this crying inladies' washroom, Mr. Balu?

444
00:38:32,171 --> 00:38:34,682
Why do you kill a dead pigeonagain and again, Madam?

445
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,266
Shouldn't that be a dead snake?

446
00:38:38,557 --> 00:38:40,891
I don't like to compare myselfwith poisonous creatures.

447
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:44,016
Why wouldn't anyone crush if asked?

448
00:38:44,307 --> 00:38:46,141
If you are so cute...

449
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,141
This is my number...Call me tomorrow.

450
00:38:55,682 --> 00:38:58,641
Not in the toilet... but let us sitsomewhere and talk peacefully.

451
00:38:59,945 --> 00:39:00,932
Ok?

452
00:39:02,724 --> 00:39:03,599
Did you hear?

453
00:39:03,891 --> 00:39:04,682
Yes.

454
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:06,641
Will you come?

455
00:39:06,724 --> 00:39:07,557
Yes.

456
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:11,849
This is what you want, right?

457
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,016
I will... I will call you.

458
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:33,849
Who hit him?

459
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:36,724
Who all came to the office yesterday?

460
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:40,391
There were interviews forPersonal Assistant post, Sir.

461
00:39:40,788 --> 00:39:42,891
There were more thana hundred applicants, Sir.

462
00:39:44,203 --> 00:39:45,599
Bring me the applications.

463
00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:50,099
Sir.

464
00:39:57,025 --> 00:39:59,307
One month old application...freshly glued.

465
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:01,224
Interesting.

466
00:40:01,682 --> 00:40:02,474
Who is he?

467
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:04,349
He only got selected, sir.

468
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:05,663
Call him.

469
00:40:15,141 --> 00:40:15,807
Thank you, Mr. Reddy.

470
00:40:15,932 --> 00:40:18,099
I think it's my landlord.To check if I have locked the gate or not?

471
00:40:22,377 --> 00:40:23,182
It's cut.

472
00:40:23,307 --> 00:40:24,349
Switch it off.

473
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:26,141
Try calling him again.

474
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:27,766
It will be switched off.

475
00:40:27,846 --> 00:40:31,597
The number you are calling is eitherunreachable or switched off at the moment.

476
00:40:31,965 --> 00:40:32,769
Please try again.

477
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:34,599
He is the wrong guy.- Sir.

478
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:36,724
Put a tab on him.- Ok sir.

479
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,766
24 hours round the clock.

480
00:40:50,128 --> 00:40:51,393
Two coff--

481
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,586
Two coffee with skimmed milk...no sugar.

482
00:40:55,003 --> 00:40:56,836
Nothing of that sort for me, Mr. Balu.

483
00:40:57,044 --> 00:40:59,503
Bring me with whole milkand lots of sugar.

484
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:04,461
When the candle doesn't fear..why should the incense stick?

485
00:41:04,544 --> 00:41:05,628
Get me the same.

486
00:41:08,169 --> 00:41:08,919
Dad!

487
00:41:09,003 --> 00:41:10,169
Where are you, dear?

488
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:12,503
I am in the coffee shop.- With whom?

489
00:41:13,086 --> 00:41:14,419
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

490
00:41:14,586 --> 00:41:17,128
You tell me a hundred things everyday.How many can I remember?

491
00:41:17,544 --> 00:41:19,253
With Mr. Bathroom Balu.

492
00:41:21,169 --> 00:41:22,086
That guy?

493
00:41:22,253 --> 00:41:24,339
He broke down and so you took himto a coffee shop.

494
00:41:24,419 --> 00:41:26,586
If he is in trouble tomorrow,don't bring him home.

495
00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:29,211
Don't I know, dad?

496
00:41:30,669 --> 00:41:35,378
See... all those who are seatedin the airplane think they are flying.

497
00:41:35,544 --> 00:41:39,544
But actually they remain seatedwhile the plane flies.

498
00:41:39,794 --> 00:41:42,461
Similarly, it feels like you knoweverything at this age.

499
00:41:42,794 --> 00:41:45,086
You don't. You only feel it.

500
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,503
I will restrict him to the other sideof the table, Dad.

501
00:41:47,628 --> 00:41:50,128
Along with him,restrict his story also there. Please.

502
00:41:51,128 --> 00:41:52,086
Ok. Ok.

503
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:55,961
By the way, Mr. Balu,why did Shruthi leave you?

504
00:41:56,128 --> 00:41:58,431
I have OCD, Sukku.

505
00:41:58,753 --> 00:42:03,169
If something is crooked, I just cannotsleep unless I make it straight.

506
00:42:04,878 --> 00:42:07,544
Shruthi was in a romantic mood one day

507
00:42:07,711 --> 00:42:09,544
and asked me for a kiss.

508
00:42:09,669 --> 00:42:11,919
I was just reaching to kiss her...

509
00:42:12,086 --> 00:42:14,669
she bent her face this way.

510
00:42:15,461 --> 00:42:18,503
Because of my OCD, I made it straight.That's it.

511
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:27,673
Hey, Sukku!- Hey! come, come...

512
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:28,753
How are you?- I'm fine.

513
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:29,798
Sit... sit...

514
00:42:29,878 --> 00:42:31,089
Meet Mr. Bathroom Balu

515
00:42:31,169 --> 00:42:32,589
Actually you know...He has OCD. - Oh.

516
00:42:32,669 --> 00:42:34,294
And he has a very interestinglove story.

517
00:42:34,378 --> 00:42:36,378
If anything isn't in a straight linehe can't tolerate it.

518
00:42:36,586 --> 00:42:38,961
Poor guy, because of thathe couldn't kiss his girlfriend.

519
00:42:39,086 --> 00:42:41,128
Can you believe it?she left him for that only...

520
00:42:41,211 --> 00:42:41,961
I don't get it.

521
00:42:42,294 --> 00:42:44,214
As they get richer their clothesbecome shorter.

522
00:42:44,294 --> 00:42:47,211
Hello.- Pull away the third person off my table!

523
00:42:47,644 --> 00:42:49,006
We should do something for Mr.Bathroom Balu

524
00:42:49,086 --> 00:42:50,586
They are demolishing your carin road widening, Sir.

525
00:42:50,711 --> 00:42:51,669
Road widening?- Yes.

526
00:42:51,878 --> 00:42:53,836
They demolish buildings, right?What do you mean by cars?

527
00:42:54,086 --> 00:42:55,544
That's why we've come from the CBI, Sir.

528
00:42:55,628 --> 00:42:56,836
Your windshield is broken.

529
00:42:57,044 --> 00:42:58,169
Broken!?- Yes!

530
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:02,919
Sukku!- Keep his mouth shut!

531
00:43:03,628 --> 00:43:05,086
We are playing a game.

532
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:07,711
So she came to me and said,

533
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,253
'Balu! This is my necessity.'

534
00:43:11,294 --> 00:43:12,669
That's all she said.

535
00:43:13,211 --> 00:43:16,294
Immediately, half a million madam...I wrote her a check for half a million...

536
00:43:16,378 --> 00:43:18,211
That too from my salary advance.

537
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:21,253
Dad!- Yes?

538
00:43:21,336 --> 00:43:23,878
That girl has swindled himfor half a million.

539
00:43:24,086 --> 00:43:26,048
Who knows whether she swindledor scooted knowing him?

540
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:27,211
That's not our problem.

541
00:43:27,294 --> 00:43:29,878
Here... 'I will convince herand I will get the money back.'

542
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:31,503
Don't do these kind of promises, please.

543
00:43:32,169 --> 00:43:33,586
Don't I know, dad?

544
00:43:35,253 --> 00:43:38,048
Read the flight dialogueonce again, dear.

545
00:43:38,128 --> 00:43:41,003
Where can we get so many quotationsfrom, every minute?

546
00:43:43,586 --> 00:43:46,003
This one wouldn't massage...that one wouldn't let her massage.

547
00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:52,086
Take me to Shuthi, once. I will seewhy she wouldn't return the money.

548
00:44:05,878 --> 00:44:06,836
What?

549
00:44:12,169 --> 00:44:13,003
Money.

550
00:44:14,336 --> 00:44:15,086
I won't give.

551
00:44:27,711 --> 00:44:29,503
Oh! Holly Molly!

552
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:31,628
Balu...

553
00:44:32,669 --> 00:44:34,503
What?- Money.

554
00:44:35,211 --> 00:44:36,294
I don't have.

555
00:44:44,669 --> 00:44:45,794
Oh, my God!

556
00:44:46,544 --> 00:44:47,628
What?

557
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:49,086
Money.

558
00:44:50,128 --> 00:44:52,086
I'll return.- When?

559
00:44:53,544 --> 00:44:55,419
Let me see the railway time table once.

560
00:44:55,836 --> 00:44:57,503
Whenever there is no train,I will call you.

561
00:44:58,794 --> 00:45:00,461
I can't take this cruelty...

562
00:45:00,544 --> 00:45:01,711
Please... leave me alone.

563
00:45:07,419 --> 00:45:11,253
Balu knows our men arefollowing him.

564
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:16,169
But we couldn't trace his addresstill now.

565
00:45:17,086 --> 00:45:19,794
Balu knows that we are following him.

566
00:45:19,961 --> 00:45:21,836
But we couldn't trace his address till now.

567
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:23,586
Whoever he is...

568
00:45:24,336 --> 00:45:27,086
I just don't want him in this office.

569
00:45:27,711 --> 00:45:29,003
I don't care who he is...

570
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:31,336
I just don't want him around.

571
00:45:31,794 --> 00:45:34,003
It's hard to make one work.

572
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:35,919
It hardly takes any timeto make one quit.

573
00:45:36,294 --> 00:45:37,211
How long?

574
00:45:37,544 --> 00:45:39,044
Give me 24 hours time...

575
00:45:39,294 --> 00:45:40,961
I'll show him the exit.

576
00:45:42,836 --> 00:45:43,586
Water.

577
00:45:50,961 --> 00:45:53,628
Such a huge office...Where is my boss?

578
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,211
Come. Come.

579
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,503
How did you come?- Just like before.

580
00:45:57,586 --> 00:45:59,169
I snitched someone's card.

581
00:46:00,753 --> 00:46:03,169
Why all this trouble? Why don't yousimply hack the password?

582
00:46:03,419 --> 00:46:05,631
Yeah. As if, you are Bill Gatesand I am Steve Jobs.

583
00:46:05,711 --> 00:46:06,961
Fool! I should thrash you.

584
00:46:07,628 --> 00:46:09,464
By the time they come here...We'll take away their computer...

585
00:46:09,544 --> 00:46:11,669
Replace it with our computer and leave.

586
00:46:12,128 --> 00:46:15,128
Then Sharma will come in a hurryand types the password in a jiffy.

587
00:46:15,294 --> 00:46:16,461
Then what happens?

588
00:46:16,628 --> 00:46:19,003
What happened, Sir? - What is this?Take a look. It's not working.

589
00:46:19,628 --> 00:46:22,711
Do you want me to try, sir?- Oh, You are one great hardware engineer.

590
00:46:22,794 --> 00:46:24,419
You don't do it.You don't let the others do it.

591
00:46:24,503 --> 00:46:25,628
Do something.

592
00:46:31,628 --> 00:46:33,544
So then... what we do is...

593
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:36,211
We'll push back our computer...

594
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:38,836
pull back their computer...

595
00:46:39,003 --> 00:46:40,919
and tell him 'Please try now, Mr. Sharma.'

596
00:46:41,294 --> 00:46:42,044
Sir.

597
00:46:45,086 --> 00:46:48,169
Wow! You are a genius, my boy!- Thank you sir.

598
00:46:48,544 --> 00:46:50,211
Do we give up once it is open?

599
00:46:50,461 --> 00:46:52,711
I will run a check for virus, Sir.

600
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:57,461
I'll take the pendrive from my pocketand connect it.

601
00:46:58,169 --> 00:47:01,169
and extract all the data like juice.

602
00:47:01,294 --> 00:47:04,419
Oh, my... you have all thefocus of a factionist

603
00:47:04,499 --> 00:47:07,003
and the smartness of a terrorist, sir.- Isn't it?

604
00:47:07,128 --> 00:47:10,253
Darling! Neither too muchnor too less...

605
00:47:10,919 --> 00:47:12,836
In rightly boiled milk,

606
00:47:13,044 --> 00:47:16,544
Just add four drops of freshlyfiltered decoction

607
00:47:16,669 --> 00:47:19,003
And bring me an aromatic,heavenly coffee.

608
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,961
A coffee for sir.

609
00:47:22,169 --> 00:47:23,300
Balu...

610
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:25,503
Kantham!

611
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:28,131
He has given you the check.- Yes!

612
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:29,419
Totally.- Totally.

613
00:47:30,419 --> 00:47:31,128
Congrats.

614
00:47:33,086 --> 00:47:35,753
You were the one who beat himthe other day, isn't it?

615
00:47:38,794 --> 00:47:39,878
Why did you beat him?

616
00:47:43,544 --> 00:47:44,669
For you...

617
00:47:45,836 --> 00:47:46,919
What should I do?

618
00:47:48,336 --> 00:47:50,878
What can I do for you?

619
00:49:41,544 --> 00:49:45,461
"12 B route to my homehad a huge road block"

620
00:51:35,503 --> 00:51:36,506
What else?

621
00:51:36,586 --> 00:51:39,753
That's... - What's this gossipingduring office hours.

622
00:51:40,044 --> 00:51:41,961
Forgetting the surroundingsyou're romancing openly.

623
00:51:42,169 --> 00:51:43,253
What's happening?

624
00:51:43,461 --> 00:51:46,048
Don't you even have the mannersto stand up when the manager is here?

625
00:51:46,128 --> 00:51:48,186
Sorry, sir... Sorry, sir...

626
00:51:48,378 --> 00:51:49,211
What man?

627
00:51:49,753 --> 00:51:51,169
Trying to look taller than me?

628
00:51:51,294 --> 00:51:53,294
You wear shoes with heels?- Not at all, sir.

629
00:51:57,753 --> 00:51:59,419
Don't tuck in the shirt.

630
00:51:59,544 --> 00:52:02,173
Tuck your brain into the computer.You will at least learn something.

631
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:03,378
Sorry, sir...

632
00:52:03,878 --> 00:52:05,794
What, Koteswara Rao?What's the problem?

633
00:52:05,878 --> 00:52:08,794
You ask 'what's the problem?'What can be a bigger problem than him?

634
00:52:08,919 --> 00:52:10,798
Sir... for you discipline is life. Right?

635
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,086
Of course.

636
00:52:12,378 --> 00:52:14,711
Go on...- Sir, see for yourself. No shoes.

637
00:52:14,919 --> 00:52:16,878
Sir, actually what happened was --- Don't speak.

638
00:52:17,003 --> 00:52:18,919
I will strangle you.Don't talk.

639
00:52:19,086 --> 00:52:20,461
Look sir... he didn't tuck in his shirt...

640
00:52:20,586 --> 00:52:22,711
And the tie? We better forget it.

641
00:52:22,919 --> 00:52:26,211
Sir! He comes to the officeas if he is going to a park...

642
00:52:26,294 --> 00:52:28,961
What is this lack of discipline, man?

643
00:52:29,378 --> 00:52:30,211
I'm talking to you...

644
00:52:30,294 --> 00:52:32,089
What can he say sir?After all the stupid things he has done.

645
00:52:32,169 --> 00:52:33,086
Calm down, Balu.

646
00:52:33,711 --> 00:52:35,669
Should I wear shoesand appear taller than you

647
00:52:36,044 --> 00:52:37,753
or remove them and be shorter than you...

648
00:52:37,919 --> 00:52:40,211
I choose to be short for a life time, sir.

649
00:52:40,836 --> 00:52:43,711
What did I achieve to be tallerthan him Mr. Koti? Tell me...

650
00:52:43,794 --> 00:52:45,753
Don't believe him at all...- Shut up!

651
00:52:46,003 --> 00:52:47,169
You go on...- Mr. Sharma.

652
00:52:47,753 --> 00:52:51,128
Am I to keep the shirt in my pantsor keep my mind in work....

653
00:52:51,419 --> 00:52:54,169
I will choose the second sir...definitely the second.

654
00:52:55,544 --> 00:52:59,003
If I made a mistake, forgive me.

655
00:52:59,753 --> 00:53:01,586
If I committed a sin...punish me.

656
00:53:02,294 --> 00:53:05,044
But my respect for youand my own self-respect...

657
00:53:05,836 --> 00:53:07,419
Never doubt them, Mr. Sharma.

658
00:53:08,128 --> 00:53:10,378
Never doubt it...- It's ok, dear...

659
00:53:12,378 --> 00:53:13,794
What happened sir?

660
00:53:15,586 --> 00:53:18,961
I never regretted being single so far.

661
00:53:20,419 --> 00:53:24,003
But I regret not having a son like himat this moment.

662
00:53:24,128 --> 00:53:25,003
By god...

663
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:28,169
Don't tell me you will adopt him?!- I don't know...

664
00:53:28,753 --> 00:53:31,586
Take two hundred as increment, son.- Two hundred?

665
00:53:32,211 --> 00:53:34,336
Two hundreds?- Yes, two hundreds. Enjoy.

666
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,294
Two hundred? Oh God!- Two hundred.

667
00:53:39,294 --> 00:53:40,378
Enough display of happiness...

668
00:53:40,503 --> 00:53:41,923
What is this?- What do you mean what?

669
00:53:42,003 --> 00:53:44,544
So much for two hundred.Imagine if you gave him thousand.

670
00:53:45,211 --> 00:53:47,253
Girl! Come aside.

671
00:53:47,419 --> 00:53:48,253
Talking to you...

672
00:53:48,878 --> 00:53:49,794
Come this side.

673
00:53:52,461 --> 00:53:55,919
Actually, I want to hug youlike that, Sir.

674
00:53:56,128 --> 00:53:58,169
Go on then... I'm right here.

675
00:53:59,044 --> 00:54:00,836
But I am timid and I havea lot of respect for you.

676
00:54:01,836 --> 00:54:02,669
Sounds good.

677
00:54:02,753 --> 00:54:06,253
But the next time you feel like kissing,come to my cabin and kiss me.

678
00:54:06,378 --> 00:54:07,836
I wouldn't mind. Ok?

679
00:54:07,919 --> 00:54:08,794
Ok, sir.

680
00:54:09,044 --> 00:54:09,798
Let's go dear...

681
00:54:09,878 --> 00:54:11,211
Ok, come to my cabin Balu.

682
00:54:11,294 --> 00:54:12,086
Come dear...

683
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:14,711
You two don't get along at all..

684
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:16,419
I can clearly see it.

685
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,461
Mr. Koti is obsessed with bribery, sir.

686
00:54:19,836 --> 00:54:23,044
Bribe for a job,bribe for promotion.

687
00:54:23,419 --> 00:54:25,669
Here a bribe...there a bribe...

688
00:54:25,878 --> 00:54:27,794
Everywhere bribe...

689
00:54:28,669 --> 00:54:30,753
Lives are being destroyed.

690
00:54:34,086 --> 00:54:37,211
Balasubramanyam... that's avery serious allegation.

691
00:54:37,294 --> 00:54:39,503
If you fail to prove, heads will roll.

692
00:54:39,586 --> 00:54:41,503
Many heads will roll... I tell you.

693
00:54:42,544 --> 00:54:45,711
Give me a million in cashand an empty suitcase.

694
00:54:45,878 --> 00:54:49,878
By 10.30 tomorrow, I will prove to youthat Mr. Koti is corrupt to the core.

695
00:54:50,794 --> 00:54:52,211
Amazing.

696
00:54:56,169 --> 00:54:57,336
Good afternoon, Mr. Koti.

697
00:55:04,419 --> 00:55:05,128
What's this?

698
00:55:05,211 --> 00:55:06,503
There is a million here andanother nine in there.

699
00:55:06,628 --> 00:55:07,544
Together, it's ten million.

700
00:55:07,628 --> 00:55:08,294
What for?

701
00:55:08,586 --> 00:55:11,794
There are technical interviews tomorrow.25 of my people need jobs.

702
00:55:12,128 --> 00:55:14,878
Four lakhs per head...- I know the calculations.

703
00:55:15,044 --> 00:55:16,964
Wait... wait... I'll tell,you are not an ordinary man.

704
00:55:17,044 --> 00:55:19,628
Do you have any cameras beneaththe collar or behind the belt

705
00:55:19,794 --> 00:55:21,836
Check for yourself...- I have my own doubts.

706
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:23,878
Tell me, now.

707
00:55:24,044 --> 00:55:25,586
I will send you the list in the evening.Confirm it.

708
00:55:26,294 --> 00:55:27,306
Ok?

709
00:55:28,003 --> 00:55:29,294
Why are you taking it back?

710
00:55:30,336 --> 00:55:32,711
You have already pocketed nine million.- Why are you fretting over one?

711
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:34,878
If I pay your subordinates a 100,000 each,they will stay quiet.

712
00:55:35,294 --> 00:55:36,836
You have a point.- Yes

713
00:55:42,919 --> 00:55:44,086
Oh, God!

714
00:55:44,169 --> 00:55:47,544
Nine million,Nine million, Nine million...

715
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:49,003
Whose stick is this?

716
00:55:49,794 --> 00:55:50,336
Move...

717
00:55:50,419 --> 00:55:52,253
I know nothing, sir!Leave me Sir!

718
00:55:52,336 --> 00:55:54,006
I am innocent.I don't know anything...

719
00:55:54,086 --> 00:55:55,919
Sir... sir... tell them, sir.

720
00:55:56,836 --> 00:55:58,378
Why do you look away, sir?

721
00:55:58,878 --> 00:56:02,586
Inspector sir... On the way, please handover the suitcase on the ground floor.

722
00:56:02,669 --> 00:56:05,794
I said I would take it if it's nice.

723
00:56:06,253 --> 00:56:07,753
You mean... there is no money in there?

724
00:56:08,211 --> 00:56:08,923
No.

725
00:56:09,003 --> 00:56:11,878
Oh, my! When there is no money,why are you arresting me?

726
00:56:12,003 --> 00:56:14,669
Hey! Rogue! Crook!I knew you well.

727
00:56:16,919 --> 00:56:20,503
There is no money there but you hadan intention to be corrupt.

728
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:21,544
For that...

729
00:56:22,336 --> 00:56:23,253
Carry on!

730
00:56:23,461 --> 00:56:24,253
Carry on- Koti?

731
00:56:24,461 --> 00:56:26,961
Sir...Sir... at least youvouch for me.

732
00:56:27,086 --> 00:56:28,794
You are funny. Why should I vouch for you?

733
00:56:29,294 --> 00:56:31,753
If you are innocent,the judge himself will vouch for it.

734
00:56:31,836 --> 00:56:33,794
Go happily.- Happily?

735
00:56:33,919 --> 00:56:37,169
You are responsible for all this.- No more talks... Drag him away!

736
00:56:37,253 --> 00:56:38,589
Take him out. Take him away.

737
00:56:38,669 --> 00:56:39,881
I will take care of youafter I am back.

738
00:56:39,961 --> 00:56:44,378
Koteswara Rao! Balasubramanyam....never leaves the guilty unpunished.

739
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:45,669
Remember this.

740
00:56:49,794 --> 00:56:52,836
I will not spare the guilty.

741
00:57:20,014 --> 00:57:21,086
Hey...

742
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:24,003
What?- Unfasten me.

743
00:57:24,203 --> 00:57:25,219
Ok.

744
00:57:28,169 --> 00:57:29,628
Make it quick...

745
00:57:33,919 --> 00:57:35,211
Bro... Bro...

746
00:57:35,878 --> 00:57:37,003
Unfasten me too...

747
00:57:37,878 --> 00:57:38,711
I can...

748
00:57:39,003 --> 00:57:40,544
But if I untie you now,it is just an escape.

749
00:57:41,044 --> 00:57:45,086
If I go to the office alone, complain tothem on these people and bring the police,

750
00:57:46,503 --> 00:57:47,586
It's revenge.

751
00:57:47,919 --> 00:57:48,878
Which one do you want?

752
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:50,503
Undoubtedly the second one.

753
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:52,253
Excellent choice. See you.

754
00:57:53,461 --> 00:57:54,503
I'm free.

755
00:57:54,628 --> 00:57:56,964
Hey! Reddy... He is running away.Catch him.

756
00:57:57,044 --> 00:57:58,294
He is running away...catch him.

757
00:57:58,378 --> 00:57:59,586
Sir, don't leave him.

758
00:57:59,669 --> 00:58:01,669
If he goes inside we'll be in danger- Balu stop!

759
00:58:02,128 --> 00:58:02,753
Greetings sir.

760
00:58:02,836 --> 00:58:04,128
What was that rage?

761
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:06,006
I can't believe it.- Then, what sir?

762
00:58:06,086 --> 00:58:09,381
I get furious when I come across injustice.In fact, I get a headache when I see it.

763
00:58:09,461 --> 00:58:10,169
True.

764
00:58:10,461 --> 00:58:13,544
If my daughter-like Kantham isin appreciation of you,

765
00:58:13,836 --> 00:58:14,961
you are definitely a genius.

766
00:58:20,294 --> 00:58:21,628
Balu stop...

767
00:58:22,628 --> 00:58:23,464
Look into the camera.

768
00:58:23,544 --> 00:58:24,378
Hey Balu...

769
00:58:24,586 --> 00:58:26,461
Hey! Stop. Stop.

770
00:58:30,419 --> 00:58:32,173
Thank you, sir.- Sharma...

771
00:58:32,253 --> 00:58:33,169
Who is he?

772
00:58:33,253 --> 00:58:37,211
Sir... - Nickname for sincerity;code name for discipline, Sir.

773
00:58:37,291 --> 00:58:39,214
What's his actual name?- Actually...

774
00:58:39,294 --> 00:58:40,794
Balasubramanyam.

775
00:58:41,044 --> 00:58:43,753
Oh! Come on Sharma...- It's true Varma.

776
00:58:44,324 --> 00:58:45,503
Sir... Sir... Sharma sir...

777
00:58:45,753 --> 00:58:48,086
I will note down the few wordsyou spoke just now.

778
00:58:48,336 --> 00:58:50,839
If you sign it, I will photo frame it.

779
00:58:50,919 --> 00:58:52,294
Please... please...- Oh...

780
00:58:52,378 --> 00:58:55,548
You are still in autograph days?Let's have a selfie moment.

781
00:58:55,628 --> 00:58:57,003
There you go!- Selfie? Sure sir.

782
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,794
Call him. - He tells me to do the thingthat I'm already doing.

783
00:59:11,253 --> 00:59:12,294
Call him quick.

784
00:59:13,711 --> 00:59:14,961
Talk... it's ok.- Please.

785
00:59:15,211 --> 00:59:16,086
Who is it, dear?

786
00:59:16,461 --> 00:59:17,461
He's cutting the call.

787
00:59:19,503 --> 00:59:20,878
Where is the Personal Manager's office?- That side.

788
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:21,964
Thank you.

789
00:59:22,044 --> 00:59:24,169
Try calling him again...- I'm trying.

790
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:29,211
Did he pick up?- He is cutting my calls.

791
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:30,756
We're all dead,if he doesn't take the call.

792
00:59:30,836 --> 00:59:32,211
Hey Balu...

793
00:59:35,628 --> 00:59:36,753
Ok... come closer.

794
00:59:36,836 --> 00:59:37,878
Smile...

795
00:59:39,086 --> 00:59:40,211
Cheese.

796
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:42,461
Smile.

797
00:59:47,169 --> 00:59:48,673
Sir, I need to speak to the manager.

798
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:49,775
Please.

799
00:59:55,294 --> 00:59:57,211
My name is Balasubramanyam, sir.

800
00:59:57,586 --> 00:59:59,753
I received a call from your Departmentfor an Assistant post.

801
01:00:00,128 --> 01:00:03,461
But a man called Abhi, cheated meand got my job sir.

802
01:00:03,544 --> 01:00:04,253
Sir...

803
01:00:04,336 --> 01:00:05,919
There's a big gang behind him.

804
01:00:06,128 --> 01:00:09,544
Laptops, cell phones, cameras.. what not..everything is in the shed across here sir.

805
01:00:09,753 --> 01:00:12,419
If you accompany me, we will goand capture those culprits.

806
01:00:12,628 --> 01:00:14,419
Sir... I don't have his photo

807
01:00:14,503 --> 01:00:16,253
But if I see him,I will recognize him... for sure.

808
01:00:16,336 --> 01:00:17,753
Are you sure?- Sure sir.

809
01:00:24,503 --> 01:00:26,003
Does he look a little like this?

810
01:00:28,447 --> 01:00:29,809
Oh no!

811
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,294
Aren't you an Assistant?

812
01:00:36,753 --> 01:00:39,211
In the previous scene,for the thrill of the audience,

813
01:00:39,294 --> 01:00:42,169
we have delayed a small dialogue.Let us watch it now.

814
01:00:42,669 --> 01:00:44,086
Balasubramanyam!- Sir.

815
01:00:44,166 --> 01:00:47,336
This very moment, you are promotedto be the Personal Manager.

816
01:00:47,586 --> 01:00:50,461
Go and rock with your work.

817
01:00:51,008 --> 01:00:54,003
So, even as I was in the lift...you got promoted!

818
01:00:54,944 --> 01:00:57,003
My bad luck is on a disco spree sir.

819
01:00:57,419 --> 01:00:58,836
I can't help it.

820
01:00:59,461 --> 01:01:00,794
Oh...- Sir.

821
01:01:01,294 --> 01:01:03,544
You seem worn out.Why don't you sit for a while?

822
01:01:03,628 --> 01:01:05,589
It's ok, sir. Anyway I have to goand continue to sit.

823
01:01:05,669 --> 01:01:06,839
Let me stand for a change...

824
01:01:06,919 --> 01:01:08,753
Ok, when did I say no to you?

825
01:01:09,628 --> 01:01:11,544
You only say so, but youdon't seem so, Sir!

826
01:01:12,003 --> 01:01:13,461
Anyway, I'll leave sir.

827
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:14,544
Ok, let me drop you.

828
01:01:14,794 --> 01:01:15,836
I can go on my own sir.

829
01:01:16,003 --> 01:01:18,003
I will drop you!- What for?

830
01:01:18,086 --> 01:01:19,378
For my satisfaction.

831
01:01:19,711 --> 01:01:20,753
I understood sir.

832
01:01:21,086 --> 01:01:22,211
You don't trust me.

833
01:01:23,836 --> 01:01:25,214
What happened to your hands?

834
01:01:25,294 --> 01:01:28,211
Always resting on the armreststhis is the state.

835
01:01:28,294 --> 01:01:30,503
Look! It doesn't go down.- Oh no!!

836
01:01:30,836 --> 01:01:33,128
Shall I adjust the armrests height?

837
01:01:34,294 --> 01:01:36,336
But you will never saythat you will leave me?

838
01:01:36,628 --> 01:01:39,378
What is this Balu? Don't act like a child.Come. Let's go.

839
01:01:39,794 --> 01:01:41,753
I miss the landlord, sir.

840
01:01:56,253 --> 01:01:57,378
I hope he didn't say anythingto anybody?

841
01:01:57,461 --> 01:01:59,794
I said everything...but only to him.

842
01:02:00,211 --> 01:02:01,419
What are you doing here?Didn't I tell you not to come.

843
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:05,048
Don't you know what would happenif we are found together?

844
01:02:05,128 --> 01:02:06,669
We all have to run awayalong with him.

845
01:02:06,753 --> 01:02:08,923
Like, I was panic strickenhe was running away...

846
01:02:09,003 --> 01:02:09,586
Take him.

847
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:11,881
Sir! Out of curiosity... why shouldn'tyou two be seen together?

848
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,089
Hey! Even with all your ignorance,he tied you up in the chair.

849
01:02:14,169 --> 01:02:16,669
If you find some knowledge,he will kill you, man! Listen to me.

850
01:02:16,753 --> 01:02:17,839
I'm a new timer andI am listening.

851
01:02:17,919 --> 01:02:19,294
Why am I bothered aboutothers' affairs?

852
01:02:19,419 --> 01:02:21,628
Take me and tie me to my chair,I can't stand this AC.

853
01:02:21,711 --> 01:02:22,881
I'm missing my shed.- Uncle.

854
01:02:22,961 --> 01:02:23,714
Coming...

855
01:02:23,794 --> 01:02:25,086
Go that way.

856
01:03:09,191 --> 01:03:11,108
My Dad, Mr. Deenabandhu had started this.- Good.

857
01:03:11,316 --> 01:03:13,278
It's an old establishment.

858
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:15,191
But good money.- Ok.

859
01:03:19,233 --> 01:03:20,617
Here we go.

860
01:03:21,941 --> 01:03:23,858
Have a nice day.- You too.

861
01:03:25,483 --> 01:03:26,736
Sir.

862
01:03:26,816 --> 01:03:28,024
Is the contract signed?

863
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:29,316
Good deal, Sudhee...

864
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:32,566
We got a better deal, sir.3% more.

865
01:03:32,994 --> 01:03:34,066
Still, it's a good deal.

866
01:03:34,369 --> 01:03:36,899
Sir, 3% means 180 crores more.

867
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:41,149
Then, it's a bad deal.

868
01:03:46,774 --> 01:03:48,441
If we convince them,will they return the contract?

869
01:03:48,566 --> 01:03:49,816
Sir it's...

870
01:03:50,233 --> 01:03:52,608
You should have told earlier, Sudhee...

871
01:03:55,941 --> 01:03:56,649
Ok.

872
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:58,358
Take care of it.

873
01:03:59,441 --> 01:04:01,327
3% is actually a big deal...

874
01:04:14,774 --> 01:04:16,899
You don't have silencersor you don't use them?

875
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,649
Where do they bring all these guys from?

876
01:04:31,066 --> 01:04:32,191
Shall we start, sir?

877
01:04:32,691 --> 01:04:33,733
Let it burn completely...

878
01:04:35,024 --> 01:04:36,608
We hardly have any other work...

879
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:44,066
From the Hyderabad office, Sir!- Who?

880
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:45,030
Parag.

881
01:04:49,191 --> 01:04:49,899
Tell me.

882
01:04:50,191 --> 01:04:52,816
I sent you some photographs on Whatsapp.Take a look, sir.

883
01:04:53,191 --> 01:04:54,149
One minute.

884
01:04:56,566 --> 01:04:59,524
This is Vinda's brother-in-law.

885
01:05:00,316 --> 01:05:03,733
Standing so close,I think... he must be related too.

886
01:05:05,524 --> 01:05:07,149
This doesn't look right, Parag.

887
01:05:07,725 --> 01:05:08,983
Shall I finish them off?

888
01:05:10,899 --> 01:05:11,608
Ok.

889
01:05:15,066 --> 01:05:19,691
Death is mysterious. You start with one.Four or five will follow.

890
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:23,149
We think we are responsible for it.

891
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:25,816
But some cosmic energy...

892
01:05:26,483 --> 01:05:28,191
Drives us all.

893
01:05:30,983 --> 01:05:32,233
Let's go...

894
01:05:39,316 --> 01:05:40,441
No, sir.

895
01:05:41,274 --> 01:05:42,649
Are you sure?- Sure.

896
01:05:43,191 --> 01:05:46,899
Son, we went through Sharma'swhole call list on the day Vinda died...

897
01:05:47,316 --> 01:05:49,816
There was no international callthat night.

898
01:05:51,834 --> 01:05:56,024
That's a two headed snake, Uncle.If not this one, it must be the other.

899
01:06:00,941 --> 01:06:01,691
Hi.

900
01:06:13,399 --> 01:06:14,566
When did she give you this?

901
01:06:14,649 --> 01:06:16,608
Would I lose a moment?

902
01:06:16,733 --> 01:06:18,191
She has just given me.I am here with it now.

903
01:06:18,358 --> 01:06:20,774
When you are meeting herdidn't I ask you to take me along?

904
01:06:21,149 --> 01:06:22,903
Actually, I thought of taking you.

905
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:26,274
I was told particularly told by her,'Balu! Don't bring Sukku.'

906
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:27,191
So I didn't take you.

907
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:28,274
Why wouldn't she?

908
01:06:28,358 --> 01:06:30,899
After all, it is easy to sway youwhen you are alone.

909
01:06:31,066 --> 01:06:33,024
Sukku! I don't get swayed by just anybody.

910
01:06:33,108 --> 01:06:35,233
I have my own values and opinions.

911
01:06:35,316 --> 01:06:36,149
Poor thing...

912
01:06:37,191 --> 01:06:39,399
She actually cried.- Where?

913
01:06:39,649 --> 01:06:40,524
In the hall!

914
01:06:41,441 --> 01:06:44,358
I didn't mean which room.I meant which position.

915
01:06:45,149 --> 01:06:48,066
Which position as in...?

916
01:06:48,608 --> 01:06:50,608
We were standing to begin with.

917
01:06:51,149 --> 01:06:51,899
Poor thing...

918
01:06:51,983 --> 01:06:54,444
She clung to me and wailed.

919
01:06:54,524 --> 01:06:55,569
I know.

920
01:06:55,649 --> 01:06:58,649
Why would she refundwithout doing an item number?

921
01:06:59,233 --> 01:07:00,858
Did you hug tight?

922
01:07:01,698 --> 01:07:04,316
Ms. Sukku! You are assuming wrongly.

923
01:07:04,524 --> 01:07:07,608
We were not hugging.We were just holding. That's all

924
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:10,649
Mr. Balasubramanyam! I am not a kid.

925
01:07:10,816 --> 01:07:12,524
How are they different? Tell me.

926
01:07:13,733 --> 01:07:15,816
Get up once...Just get up, please.

927
01:07:16,649 --> 01:07:17,941
Come closer to me.

928
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,649
Holding means....

929
01:07:20,399 --> 01:07:21,608
This.

930
01:07:24,108 --> 01:07:25,899
This is called holding.

931
01:07:26,316 --> 01:07:29,066
Hugging means...Come a little closer...

932
01:07:30,316 --> 01:07:30,983
Closer...

933
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:44,733
This is called hugging.

934
01:07:47,233 --> 01:07:50,191
So, if you kiss her with your lips,it's not a kiss.

935
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,941
It's just touching.

936
01:07:52,149 --> 01:07:53,735
But if she opens her lips

937
01:07:53,815 --> 01:07:57,566
and your tongue reaches forthe breakfast she has in her teeth gaps.

938
01:07:57,816 --> 01:08:00,108
And you search for it,then it's called a kiss.

939
01:08:00,233 --> 01:08:00,941
Right?

940
01:08:01,983 --> 01:08:02,691
Tell me...

941
01:08:02,774 --> 01:08:05,649
Ms. Sukku why do you hurt mewith these satires?

942
01:08:05,774 --> 01:08:06,566
Do I?

943
01:08:06,691 --> 01:08:07,608
Don't you?

944
01:08:08,066 --> 01:08:09,483
Then, I am really sorry, sir.

945
01:08:10,233 --> 01:08:11,191
Ms Sukku...

946
01:08:11,608 --> 01:08:13,858
I feel... I feel like crying.

947
01:08:14,399 --> 01:08:15,983
Wait for a couple of minutes Mr. Balu.

948
01:08:16,108 --> 01:08:18,524
Let me find a nice girl.You can cry holding onto her.

949
01:08:18,816 --> 01:08:19,816
Ms Sukku!

950
01:08:24,858 --> 01:08:26,024
Tell me, Dad.

951
01:08:26,274 --> 01:08:27,316
Hello, dear...

952
01:08:27,515 --> 01:08:30,358
Uncle Naveen will be herefrom the States in a week.

953
01:08:30,483 --> 01:08:32,524
What should I ask him get you?Creams or games?

954
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:34,316
Get me a nice guy.

955
01:08:36,233 --> 01:08:38,941
You seem to be in a foul mood,I'll call you back.

956
01:08:39,191 --> 01:08:41,066
This is not the right time.Oh no.

957
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:52,608
Ms Sukku! What do you gainby hurting a nice person like me?

958
01:08:52,733 --> 01:08:54,149
You will be afflicted by my grief.

959
01:08:54,358 --> 01:08:57,608
May there be great floral fallson your way!

960
01:12:08,024 --> 01:12:10,399
When the Pandavas were in exile,

961
01:12:10,983 --> 01:12:14,108
a few spies of the Kauravasspotted them.

962
01:12:14,483 --> 01:12:18,733
If they were to be killed, the Kauravaswould know where the Pandavas were.

963
01:12:21,524 --> 01:12:25,399
"If left free, they would informthe Kauravas about the Pandavas."

964
01:12:25,858 --> 01:12:28,566
The Kauravas would still knowthe place of their hiding.

965
01:12:29,899 --> 01:12:30,858
What to do then?

966
01:12:31,566 --> 01:12:33,024
Should they kill them and run away?

967
01:12:33,441 --> 01:12:35,108
Or should they get caughtby not killing them.

968
01:12:35,691 --> 01:12:39,899
How to finish the exilewithout getting caught.

969
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:44,024
How to solve this problem?

970
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:46,524
Then, Nakula came up with an idea.

971
01:12:48,608 --> 01:12:50,358
Let us kill the spies.

972
01:12:50,608 --> 01:12:51,483
But...

973
01:12:51,816 --> 01:12:55,441
But without leaving our mark let usmake the deaths look natural.

974
01:13:54,149 --> 01:13:58,191
To kill silently using the surroundings...

975
01:13:58,483 --> 01:13:59,774
Is called the Nakula Dharma.

976
01:14:09,233 --> 01:14:10,441
What happened?

977
01:14:11,779 --> 01:14:14,191
When I was with Varma's daughter,I was attacked, Uncle...

978
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:15,691
That too with guns.

979
01:14:17,316 --> 01:14:19,566
With his daughter around,I don't think Varma would plan an attack.

980
01:14:20,358 --> 01:14:21,899
Even Sharma is not connected.

981
01:14:22,233 --> 01:14:23,649
But we heard their voices, haven't we?

982
01:14:24,066 --> 01:14:25,024
We did hear...

983
01:14:26,108 --> 01:14:28,108
Their voices must have been recordedin the office minutes.

984
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:31,024
Thirty years ago we tried once Vinda...

985
01:14:31,191 --> 01:14:32,066
Thank God.

986
01:14:32,191 --> 01:14:35,149
They said luck was on our side...you were saved.

987
01:14:35,358 --> 01:14:36,566
Your son... this morning...

988
01:14:36,899 --> 01:14:37,733
and now... it's you.

989
01:14:37,941 --> 01:14:38,944
Vinda...

990
01:14:39,024 --> 01:14:40,691
It's time that we changethe company's logo

991
01:14:40,816 --> 01:14:42,648
It's really looking so old and dated.

992
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:45,024
You don't have an heirfor your business empire.

993
01:14:45,108 --> 01:14:46,858
So there was no need fornew vaccines.

994
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:49,524
Editing those voices, they might'vecreated a file.

995
01:14:51,566 --> 01:14:54,316
They transferred it into a phoneand made sure it reached us.

996
01:14:54,941 --> 01:14:57,191
They made us suspect that those twoare behind the murders.

997
01:14:57,399 --> 01:14:58,399
Correct sir.

998
01:15:00,274 --> 01:15:03,274
In Siena, among the belongings of your dad,his phone wasn't there.

999
01:15:03,941 --> 01:15:05,483
Someone added it in India.

1000
01:15:11,274 --> 01:15:12,483
Who?

1001
01:15:13,733 --> 01:15:16,858
Who could be following usfrom the same building we are chasing?

1002
01:15:17,149 --> 01:15:18,733
Vinda is a man with Plan B.

1003
01:15:19,108 --> 01:15:20,024
Why?

1004
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:21,691
Why did Vinda laugh?

1005
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,233
Just before dying.

1006
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:24,649
We need these answers.

1007
01:15:25,024 --> 01:15:27,399
Will he die without an heir?

1008
01:15:27,816 --> 01:15:29,483
Who is his heir apparent?

1009
01:15:29,899 --> 01:15:32,233
How will he come?What should we do to make him come?

1010
01:15:32,441 --> 01:15:33,774
He gave two names.

1011
01:15:34,066 --> 01:15:35,774
Varma... Sharma...

1012
01:15:35,941 --> 01:15:39,691
We came in search of them,first my brother and then my father.

1013
01:15:42,316 --> 01:15:45,233
Earlier today they attacked me...next will be my mother.

1014
01:15:45,524 --> 01:15:48,066
I wanted to give him a quiet death.

1015
01:15:49,104 --> 01:15:52,108
But... along with the colourand odour of blood,

1016
01:15:52,858 --> 01:15:55,358
He wants to hear the sound of death too.

1017
01:15:57,108 --> 01:15:58,441
We will make him listen.

1018
01:15:59,316 --> 01:16:01,441
Till his ears bleed...

1019
01:16:02,191 --> 01:16:03,899
Till his ears bleed...

1020
01:16:33,274 --> 01:16:34,191
Channel 1

1021
01:16:34,566 --> 01:16:35,816
Channel 1 come in.

1022
01:16:38,108 --> 01:16:38,983
Channel 2...

1023
01:16:40,024 --> 01:16:40,899
Channel 2...

1024
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:25,274
Channel 3...

1025
01:17:25,691 --> 01:17:26,733
Channel 3 come in...

1026
01:17:37,108 --> 01:17:38,359
Hands up!

1027
01:18:54,149 --> 01:18:56,358
Channel 3, 4, 5, 6

1028
01:18:59,108 --> 01:19:00,274
Four.

1029
01:19:01,483 --> 01:19:03,149
Through the door one shot.

1030
01:19:05,524 --> 01:19:07,316
and I missed one...

1031
01:19:08,774 --> 01:19:10,899
There's only one bullet left.

1032
01:19:11,191 --> 01:19:13,441
Indrani is two feet away from me.

1033
01:19:14,233 --> 01:19:15,441
I will die.

1034
01:19:16,691 --> 01:19:18,816
But I'll kill her and then die.

1035
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,774
Who sent you?- Seetharam.

1036
01:19:45,729 --> 01:19:48,024
Deenabandhu's son has sent me.

1037
01:20:02,149 --> 01:20:04,483
Your son... this morning...and now... it's you.

1038
01:20:05,524 --> 01:20:08,024
Your business empire has no heirs now.

1039
01:20:37,858 --> 01:20:39,191
Who are you?

1040
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:41,233
Abhishikta Bhargav...

1041
01:20:41,941 --> 01:20:43,649
Indrani Vinda's son.

1042
01:21:10,566 --> 01:21:12,566
To craft a weapon...

1043
01:21:13,358 --> 01:21:14,816
you need a hand...

1044
01:21:16,066 --> 01:21:17,691
You need a thought...

1045
01:21:18,983 --> 01:21:20,524
Need some selfishness.

1046
01:21:21,316 --> 01:21:23,149
But for destruction...

1047
01:21:24,149 --> 01:21:25,774
There should have been some injustice...

1048
01:21:27,524 --> 01:21:29,274
There should be a prayer...

1049
01:21:30,983 --> 01:21:32,941
We need to appeal with anguish...

1050
01:21:35,108 --> 01:21:36,524
That's what I did.

1051
01:21:37,066 --> 01:21:39,691
The murderers of my husbandand my son...

1052
01:21:41,024 --> 01:21:43,483
Will you let them go unpunished?

1053
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:46,399
I questioned Him, raising my head.

1054
01:21:48,441 --> 01:21:51,024
God's reply to me...

1055
01:21:54,691 --> 01:21:56,483
Abhishikta Bhargav...

1056
01:21:58,941 --> 01:22:00,566
Vinda's elder son.

1057
01:22:04,816 --> 01:22:07,483
He is not the Bhargav you know, Appaji.

1058
01:22:08,983 --> 01:22:11,899
He is not your sister's sonthat you brought up.

1059
01:22:13,441 --> 01:22:14,399
I know...

1060
01:22:15,649 --> 01:22:18,274
I didn't call for an ordinary man.

1061
01:22:19,858 --> 01:22:22,941
He is a war like destruction...

1062
01:22:24,524 --> 01:22:26,649
A walking deadly-weapon...

1063
01:22:53,566 --> 01:22:56,524
Slaying recklessly is violence, Appaji.

1064
01:22:57,316 --> 01:23:00,024
Killing with judgment is virtuous dharma...

1065
01:23:01,066 --> 01:23:02,899
They followed the former...

1066
01:23:03,566 --> 01:23:04,608
The second...

1067
01:23:05,149 --> 01:23:06,524
He will do.

1068
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,285
Deenabandhu...

1069
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:29,993
Travelled 25 years with your father...

1070
01:23:32,743 --> 01:23:38,993
He never questioned your father...not once.

1071
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:41,618
When he passed away,

1072
01:23:42,702 --> 01:23:44,785
For the last time.

1073
01:23:45,827 --> 01:23:47,493
I saw his son, Seetaram,

1074
01:23:48,118 --> 01:23:50,660
That young boy is behind all this?

1075
01:23:51,827 --> 01:23:52,702
But why?

1076
01:23:52,993 --> 01:23:54,993
If someone is hungrythey never question 'why'.

1077
01:23:55,118 --> 01:23:57,577
If someone is hungry for powerthey definitely question...

1078
01:23:58,202 --> 01:23:59,285
Why?

1079
01:24:02,535 --> 01:24:03,785
Now...

1080
01:24:04,327 --> 01:24:06,202
I want to become the CEO

1081
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:07,868
But I won't ask for it...

1082
01:24:08,368 --> 01:24:10,410
I removed the people qualifiedfor the post

1083
01:24:11,243 --> 01:24:14,702
Now the board has no other optionexcept Seetaram

1084
01:24:15,827 --> 01:24:18,868
They have to plead me,beg me and cry over it.

1085
01:24:19,410 --> 01:24:20,660
Then...

1086
01:24:21,785 --> 01:24:23,410
Then I'll come and occupy...

1087
01:24:23,952 --> 01:24:25,285
That chair.

1088
01:24:25,743 --> 01:24:28,827
If you really want the CEO position,you should ask for it.

1089
01:24:29,202 --> 01:24:30,243
Plead for it...

1090
01:24:30,618 --> 01:24:32,702
your shirt should creaseand you must sweat...

1091
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:36,910
Bend on both your knees and scream...

1092
01:24:37,702 --> 01:24:39,993
'Why am I not getting the post?'

1093
01:24:42,493 --> 01:24:44,035
Then I'll tell you...

1094
01:24:47,377 --> 01:24:48,618
'No'.

1095
01:24:49,118 --> 01:24:51,788
After his father's death, Seetharamnever stepped into that building.

1096
01:24:51,868 --> 01:24:53,035
Why will he come now?

1097
01:24:53,202 --> 01:24:55,827
He won't. We will make him come.

1098
01:24:58,535 --> 01:25:00,077
I have Plan B.

1099
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:12,618
Sir! They discarded themlike used plastic bottles.

1100
01:25:12,785 --> 01:25:16,243
Three days since the accidentbut no one claimed the bodies so far.

1101
01:25:16,452 --> 01:25:20,618
They didn't die in an accident, Ravi.The accident occurred after they died.

1102
01:25:21,285 --> 01:25:22,743
Are you going to the accident spot, sir?

1103
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,160
Forget about the accident.

1104
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:27,535
We should know what hadhappened before that.

1105
01:25:27,702 --> 01:25:28,910
Come... hold this.- Yes, sir.

1106
01:25:45,202 --> 01:25:47,160
This is confidential...

1107
01:25:47,327 --> 01:25:48,327
Tell me.

1108
01:25:49,827 --> 01:25:52,368
My Secretary. He can stay.

1109
01:25:55,077 --> 01:25:57,368
Your husband Vinda's case isalmost solved.

1110
01:25:57,577 --> 01:25:59,118
It's a clear case of suicide.

1111
01:25:59,410 --> 01:26:02,535
Probably due to family problemsor business problems...

1112
01:26:03,285 --> 01:26:05,285
It could be because of you...

1113
01:26:07,077 --> 01:26:07,952
What?

1114
01:26:13,827 --> 01:26:16,743
And as for your son...it was an accident.

1115
01:26:17,327 --> 01:26:20,160
Nothing much to think about...

1116
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:23,285
Must have been drunk while driving.

1117
01:26:25,243 --> 01:26:28,535
Three days ago there wasa big accident outside, did you know?

1118
01:26:28,743 --> 01:26:29,785
No?!

1119
01:26:30,827 --> 01:26:33,702
There was a loud crash.The car blew up

1120
01:26:34,035 --> 01:26:36,285
Seven of them died.

1121
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,327
I'm sure you would know it.

1122
01:26:39,618 --> 01:26:42,327
Even if a missile goes off outside,this glass wouldn't break inside.

1123
01:26:42,535 --> 01:26:43,910
The house is constructedwith such strength.

1124
01:26:44,368 --> 01:26:46,118
Madam could hear nothing.

1125
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:49,618
I've come to speak to Madam.

1126
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:09,160
Sitting before her, for an ACPis deal big enough.

1127
01:27:10,452 --> 01:27:12,452
Be content with what you get, Officer.

1128
01:27:12,618 --> 01:27:15,118
Do you even know whomyou are speaking to?

1129
01:27:19,202 --> 01:27:21,452
It's been so long since her husbandand son had passed away.

1130
01:27:21,577 --> 01:27:25,452
Not a single call aboutthe investigation.

1131
01:27:25,868 --> 01:27:28,285
Strange, isn't it?

1132
01:27:31,035 --> 01:27:35,035
Affliction or infliction...we do it in silence.

1133
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:39,660
Thanks.

1134
01:27:39,952 --> 01:27:42,910
Police may not catch allthe culprits, Madam.

1135
01:27:43,243 --> 01:27:46,035
But to leave the likely to be guilty,

1136
01:27:46,535 --> 01:27:49,285
is never heard of in my experience.

1137
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:50,827
Right, Ravi?

1138
01:27:50,993 --> 01:27:51,827
Yes, sir.

1139
01:27:52,035 --> 01:27:53,868
What happens all the timeis experience.

1140
01:27:54,077 --> 01:27:56,035
What happens rarely is a miracle.

1141
01:27:56,827 --> 01:27:58,493
You will see a miracle this time.

1142
01:27:59,202 --> 01:28:00,577
I promise you that.

1143
01:28:07,368 --> 01:28:09,702
Sheila, coffee please.

1144
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:13,577
You restrained me andso I controlled myself. Or....

1145
01:28:13,868 --> 01:28:15,993
Who is that guy, sir?He was so rough in his attitude!

1146
01:28:22,202 --> 01:28:23,118
Who?

1147
01:28:24,202 --> 01:28:27,535
Who could make Indrani sitwith a simple gesture?

1148
01:28:29,618 --> 01:28:30,702
Who is he?

1149
01:28:31,827 --> 01:28:35,493
Who could drive us out witha silent stare?

1150
01:28:37,327 --> 01:28:39,493
Did you have proper look at him, Ravi?

1151
01:28:40,702 --> 01:28:42,827
He filled the entire room!

1152
01:28:43,993 --> 01:28:45,785
As soon as he was angry,

1153
01:28:46,452 --> 01:28:49,327
the air stood still in that room.

1154
01:28:50,868 --> 01:28:52,410
We were out of breath.

1155
01:28:56,077 --> 01:28:59,160
Let's go by your question'Who is that guy, sir?'

1156
01:28:59,702 --> 01:29:03,202
But with a slight change...'Who is this guy?'

1157
01:29:05,243 --> 01:29:07,660
Govinda Bhargav... a.k.a Vinda.

1158
01:29:08,327 --> 01:29:11,035
He came from a middle class familywith big dreams.

1159
01:29:11,702 --> 01:29:15,535
Vinda, along with his four friends,started a business.

1160
01:29:16,077 --> 01:29:20,868
He chose the most profitable pharmabusiness in the late seventies...

1161
01:29:21,535 --> 01:29:25,243
In the African countries,TB vaccine had a lot of demand.

1162
01:29:25,743 --> 01:29:29,368
For four million, he bought the patentof the vaccine.

1163
01:29:29,743 --> 01:29:35,077
To set up a factory, he bought a sitein a backward area at throw away price.

1164
01:29:35,410 --> 01:29:39,743
The local MLA threatened Vindafor money.

1165
01:29:40,327 --> 01:29:45,285
It seems your factory emits not smokebut poison.

1166
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:48,077
It seems you are overusing the water.

1167
01:29:48,452 --> 01:29:50,785
It seems your workers are not providedproper amenities.

1168
01:29:51,243 --> 01:29:54,618
We will rake up some issueat every stage.

1169
01:29:55,202 --> 01:29:56,827
Until you back down...

1170
01:29:58,702 --> 01:30:00,952
until you bow down.

1171
01:30:04,243 --> 01:30:05,702
Unnecessarily don't waste your time, Vinda.

1172
01:30:05,785 --> 01:30:06,660
Pay him.

1173
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:09,160
I don't do wrongs.

1174
01:30:10,618 --> 01:30:12,035
I do business.

1175
01:30:13,535 --> 01:30:15,577
I'll send you a card for the opening.

1176
01:30:17,410 --> 01:30:19,243
Please come for breakfast.

1177
01:30:28,616 --> 01:30:31,179
Come on, hurry!

1178
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:33,654
Our fields will be ruined!

1179
01:30:33,734 --> 01:30:34,876
Don't let them get away!

1180
01:30:34,956 --> 01:30:37,914
The smoke from this factory is poisonous!

1181
01:30:37,994 --> 01:30:41,665
We all will die!Break everything down!

1182
01:30:41,745 --> 01:30:45,655
Don't let them get away!Break the gate!

1183
01:30:45,861 --> 01:30:48,452
Catch them!- Hey... come on.

1184
01:30:49,612 --> 01:30:51,764
Catch them!

1185
01:30:54,577 --> 01:30:57,537
Faster... faster... come...come...- Come on... come on...

1186
01:31:02,702 --> 01:31:03,660
Get in. Get in.

1187
01:31:05,743 --> 01:31:06,702
Get in. Get in.

1188
01:31:07,118 --> 01:31:08,493
Vinda! Faster!

1189
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:13,035
Come fast Vinda... come fast...come on!

1190
01:31:15,535 --> 01:31:17,368
Adi! Faster! Adi...

1191
01:31:17,618 --> 01:31:18,785
Don't stop Adi.

1192
01:31:19,013 --> 01:31:21,035
When we spoke last night, you didn't saythat so many people would come...

1193
01:31:33,766 --> 01:31:35,422
Burn everything down!

1194
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:41,160
Come fast, Vinda!

1195
01:31:41,358 --> 01:31:43,483
Come fast!- Listen to me, Vinda.

1196
01:31:44,758 --> 01:31:45,660
Let me explain.

1197
01:31:45,785 --> 01:31:48,955
Come on. Come on. Fast! Get in... get in.- I got you.

1198
01:31:49,035 --> 01:31:51,185
Vinda, don't make a mistake again Vinda.- Come inside.

1199
01:31:51,452 --> 01:31:52,785
They will kill me, Vinda.

1200
01:31:53,202 --> 01:31:54,452
Stop the flight Vinda!

1201
01:31:54,532 --> 01:31:56,327
Stop the flight Vinda!

1202
01:31:57,035 --> 01:31:57,910
Let me in.

1203
01:31:58,035 --> 01:31:59,243
They will kill me Vinda.

1204
01:31:59,327 --> 01:32:00,660
Listen to me, Vinda.

1205
01:32:00,993 --> 01:32:03,118
Vinda! Stop the flight!

1206
01:32:05,702 --> 01:32:07,202
Vinda!

1207
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:10,243
Stop the flight Vinda.

1208
01:32:18,204 --> 01:32:19,618
Vinda!

1209
01:32:27,835 --> 01:32:30,766
It's ok, Vinda...It's ok... Leave him.

1210
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:51,732
Dheena...

1211
01:32:52,868 --> 01:32:54,743
Oh, my God!- Oh no!

1212
01:32:54,827 --> 01:32:55,872
Vinda...

1213
01:32:55,952 --> 01:32:57,202
Vinda! This is broken...

1214
01:32:57,618 --> 01:32:59,128
Damn!

1215
01:33:14,243 --> 01:33:16,452
It's my Plan B.

1216
01:33:18,368 --> 01:33:20,868
At that moment...

1217
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:25,077
There was no difference between Adi,standing down and these seated with me.

1218
01:33:28,085 --> 01:33:30,785
I started seeing their true colours.

1219
01:33:33,618 --> 01:33:36,160
Suddenly... I felt lonely.

1220
01:33:38,952 --> 01:33:40,118
Who is she?

1221
01:33:40,327 --> 01:33:42,368
Vinda's first wife, sir.Krishnaveni.

1222
01:33:44,413 --> 01:33:45,577
Did he ditch her?

1223
01:33:46,715 --> 01:33:47,535
No sir...

1224
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:49,993
They were holidaying in Bali

1225
01:33:50,551 --> 01:33:54,368
when some goons entered the resortand shot her dead.

1226
01:33:56,535 --> 01:33:59,035
It's a very tragic murder, Sir.

1227
01:34:00,410 --> 01:34:03,910
Seven years later, he married Indrani.

1228
01:34:05,229 --> 01:34:08,252
Their only son was Mohan Bhargav.

1229
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:11,091
He is the one who diedin the recent accident, sir.

1230
01:34:12,743 --> 01:34:15,702
So, Vinda has no heirs.

1231
01:34:16,049 --> 01:34:18,827
AB Group of companies is an orphan.

1232
01:34:20,584 --> 01:34:23,285
Then... who is the guy behind Indrani?

1233
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:29,327
This Vinda's life maybe an open book, Ravi.

1234
01:34:30,077 --> 01:34:32,577
But there are many missing pages.

1235
01:34:33,035 --> 01:34:35,368
I guess I'll have to reconstructthis whole story.

1236
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:38,410
Ravi, I need Krishnaveni'sPostmortem Report.

1237
01:34:38,535 --> 01:34:40,410
The body is totally disfigured, sir.

1238
01:34:43,077 --> 01:34:44,285
If I am not wrong,

1239
01:34:44,452 --> 01:34:47,243
By the time they went to Bali,Krishnaveni might've been pregnant.

1240
01:34:48,535 --> 01:34:52,702
That day in the attack at the resort,some other girl must have died.

1241
01:34:55,368 --> 01:34:59,827
Anyway, the face was beyond recognitionas per the postmortem.

1242
01:35:00,077 --> 01:35:04,827
Vinda must have taken advantageand convinced everybody it was Krishnaveni.

1243
01:35:05,243 --> 01:35:08,910
The man who made an empireworth of 50 billions in five years

1244
01:35:09,077 --> 01:35:11,243
I don't think this would have beena big issue for him.

1245
01:35:11,493 --> 01:35:17,118
But will a man of Vinda's stature takethe murder attempt on his wife so easily?

1246
01:35:17,535 --> 01:35:19,577
So, he must have lost his trust in all.

1247
01:35:19,868 --> 01:35:22,952
He was concerned about his wife's safety...and hence must have convinced her

1248
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:25,202
for delivery at some other place.

1249
01:35:25,618 --> 01:35:27,785
Must've been a very tough call.

1250
01:35:28,118 --> 01:35:31,910
She must have died in the labour roomor a little later.

1251
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:35,702
Or we would have knownabout her presence.

1252
01:35:36,118 --> 01:35:39,827
In that case, where wouldhe have brought up his son?

1253
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:43,243
Whom could he have given him to?

1254
01:35:46,077 --> 01:35:50,368
Why are people so greedabout others' money...

1255
01:35:52,410 --> 01:35:57,118
I want to set up a factory and myown friend holds a meeting behind my back.

1256
01:35:57,577 --> 01:35:59,577
As my business prospers...

1257
01:36:00,702 --> 01:36:04,868
and people around me tryto kill me and my family.

1258
01:36:06,202 --> 01:36:07,285
Appaji...

1259
01:36:11,021 --> 01:36:19,368
Bring him up with no desire for moneyand not money as his ambition.

1260
01:36:20,035 --> 01:36:23,660
Once he is stable enough to seemoney as just a colour paper...

1261
01:36:24,535 --> 01:36:26,618
I will bestow him with all my earnings.

1262
01:36:28,035 --> 01:36:29,202
Then...

1263
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:32,452
I will crown him then.

1264
01:36:36,493 --> 01:36:41,702
Who is a better king thanone who can renounce his throne?

1265
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:45,368
Until that day,

1266
01:36:45,952 --> 01:36:51,035
Don't let the world knowVinda has a son.

1267
01:36:52,410 --> 01:36:55,118
So... by the time Vinda married Indrani,

1268
01:36:55,368 --> 01:36:58,118
he was the father of a seven year old son.

1269
01:36:59,915 --> 01:37:01,460
Interesting!

1270
01:37:06,077 --> 01:37:07,918
What are you doing inthe Registrar's office?

1271
01:37:07,998 --> 01:37:09,285
What are you doing?

1272
01:37:11,285 --> 01:37:13,118
I have come to get married.

1273
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:15,160
I have come to see the marriage.

1274
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:17,910
Ok.

1275
01:37:20,785 --> 01:37:21,993
Want some chocolate?

1276
01:37:22,202 --> 01:37:23,702
Yes, but I don't have money.

1277
01:37:26,493 --> 01:37:27,888
Hold them.

1278
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,118
Even I don't have money...Eat quietly.

1279
01:37:38,285 --> 01:37:39,660
Thank you.

1280
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:41,743
Dear...

1281
01:37:44,993 --> 01:37:48,452
Definitely, the wedding took placewith the consent of the boy.

1282
01:37:53,702 --> 01:37:57,160
Such a beautiful relation betweena step mom and the step son...

1283
01:37:57,535 --> 01:37:58,702
It's a wonder, sir!

1284
01:38:01,452 --> 01:38:03,785
Uncle! I want a bicycle.- There!

1285
01:38:04,327 --> 01:38:06,452
I need a bigger one.- I will buy after you grow up.

1286
01:38:06,785 --> 01:38:08,660
It's my birthday today.

1287
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:16,535
Happy Birthday, Abhi!

1288
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:20,993
Happy Birthday, Abhi!

1289
01:38:22,993 --> 01:38:23,952
Thanks, mom.

1290
01:38:27,993 --> 01:38:29,618
Mom, he is getting too skinny...

1291
01:38:29,827 --> 01:38:31,243
Send him to me, I'll take care of him.

1292
01:38:32,077 --> 01:38:34,410
Who is stopping you?Take care of him.

1293
01:38:41,035 --> 01:38:44,202
40% of total property toAbhishikta Bhargav...

1294
01:38:44,827 --> 01:38:47,160
40% to Mohan Bhargav...

1295
01:38:47,577 --> 01:38:50,493
20% to Indrani Bhargav...

1296
01:38:51,077 --> 01:38:51,993
Aren't you happy?

1297
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:53,327
I didn't like it.

1298
01:38:54,327 --> 01:38:56,410
Give my 20% to him.

1299
01:38:57,577 --> 01:38:58,660
To Mohan?

1300
01:39:01,785 --> 01:39:03,035
To Abhi, Vinda.

1301
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:04,785
'A B H I'

1302
01:39:06,077 --> 01:39:08,702
We gave him nothingsince childhood.

1303
01:39:09,243 --> 01:39:10,493
Let me do it now.

1304
01:39:10,868 --> 01:39:12,785
Of course, it's your own earnings.

1305
01:39:13,035 --> 01:39:16,618
I am going to write my 20% in his name.Whether you like it or not...

1306
01:39:23,035 --> 01:39:24,702
If my guess is right...

1307
01:39:24,952 --> 01:39:29,202
she must be fonder of her step sonthan her own.

1308
01:39:29,703 --> 01:39:30,743
So must he.

1309
01:39:30,952 --> 01:39:33,910
When she stood uphe was pulling the chair...

1310
01:39:34,077 --> 01:39:35,410
Then I felt...

1311
01:39:35,785 --> 01:39:39,410
He would give his life for her andalso he would kill anyone for her.

1312
01:39:40,035 --> 01:39:43,368
Vinda...just like hiding the formulain a box unknown to his friends,

1313
01:39:43,702 --> 01:39:47,868
he has hidden a son unknownto the world.

1314
01:39:50,285 --> 01:39:52,035
He is Vinda's son.

1315
01:39:54,732 --> 01:39:56,327
Vinda's son.

1316
01:39:58,577 --> 01:40:00,660
He is my Plan B.

1317
01:40:01,077 --> 01:40:05,920
A wolf once killed an incautious lionalong with its cub

1318
01:40:06,827 --> 01:40:09,035
and declared itself as theking of the jungle.

1319
01:40:10,202 --> 01:40:13,368
But in the cave behind it,in the dark,

1320
01:40:13,910 --> 01:40:17,577
there was another lion cubhungry and waiting.

1321
01:41:27,835 --> 01:41:30,002
Sharma!- Varma!

1322
01:41:30,252 --> 01:41:34,127
Either, I shall be.- Or I shall be.

1323
01:41:34,831 --> 01:41:36,210
CEO.- CEO.

1324
01:41:39,127 --> 01:41:41,710
The CEO is downstairs.Go, greet him.

1325
01:41:43,335 --> 01:41:44,643
Let's go...

1326
01:41:45,877 --> 01:41:48,418
Why do you look at me?Go down and take a look at him.

1327
01:41:48,627 --> 01:41:51,668
Vinda's son is here...your Bathroom Balu.

1328
01:41:53,252 --> 01:41:54,668
Move dear...

1329
01:42:15,335 --> 01:42:16,335
Balu?

1330
01:42:16,668 --> 01:42:19,252
What Balu? As if you are my Godfatherwho christened me!

1331
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:21,710
Abhi.

1332
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:23,835
Abhishikta Bhargav...

1333
01:42:24,127 --> 01:42:26,752
don't say you don't knowyour p's and q's...I will skin you alive.

1334
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:28,252
A random guy walks in...

1335
01:42:28,377 --> 01:42:30,238
Declares Vinda is his father and he,Vinda's son...

1336
01:42:30,318 --> 01:42:32,085
you think we would say 'yes, sir'and offer the seat?

1337
01:42:32,585 --> 01:42:34,668
Hey! No force used, Varma,

1338
01:42:35,293 --> 01:42:38,793
Only those who believe I am Vinda's son,raise your hands.

1339
01:42:38,918 --> 01:42:40,710
What about those who don't?

1340
01:42:41,168 --> 01:42:44,335
Well... those who don't...stretch your hands forward.

1341
01:42:44,543 --> 01:42:47,460
Is this a school to stretch outour palms and be caned?

1342
01:42:47,543 --> 01:42:49,585
What is he talking, Sharma?

1343
01:42:50,043 --> 01:42:51,585
I don't know, Varma.

1344
01:42:57,252 --> 01:42:58,210
Boys...

1345
01:42:58,543 --> 01:43:00,710
Don't be scared,help me with the belt...

1346
01:43:09,543 --> 01:43:10,502
Sharma....

1347
01:43:10,627 --> 01:43:12,960
I think you were hasty, Varma.

1348
01:43:18,675 --> 01:43:20,507
Wait a minute.- Disgusting!

1349
01:43:21,418 --> 01:43:24,918
Uncle, uncle... let us also go downstairs.- We can add a few lashes.

1350
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:26,710
What if he lashes at us?- No need...

1351
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:27,793
Let us be here and enjoy.

1352
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:32,627
Balu...he doesn't acceptand you flog me? Just asking.

1353
01:43:32,835 --> 01:43:35,043
That idiot has at least openedthe dialogue.

1354
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:38,210
What about you? 'I have nothing to dowith this fellow' sort of silence...

1355
01:43:38,377 --> 01:43:39,460
Arrogance?- No...

1356
01:43:41,918 --> 01:43:44,002
Pride?- No, fear.

1357
01:43:46,835 --> 01:43:48,127
Fear?- Yes.

1358
01:43:50,795 --> 01:43:54,127
I find no trace of fearon your face, man!

1359
01:43:54,210 --> 01:43:55,338
Oh, no! Please, don't say that.

1360
01:43:55,418 --> 01:43:58,752
The thing is I never came acrossanything fearsome in my life.

1361
01:43:58,877 --> 01:44:02,062
Probably that is why theexpression is missing. Natural!

1362
01:44:04,418 --> 01:44:06,043
Then, let's do something...

1363
01:44:06,504 --> 01:44:08,002
You will wet your pants...a frightening experience.

1364
01:44:08,127 --> 01:44:11,585
I will give you a frightening experience.Hot... fresh... will be served right now.

1365
01:44:12,002 --> 01:44:13,627
How?- Like this.

1366
01:44:21,668 --> 01:44:24,585
Sharma is running, Sir.Boss is chasing, Sir.

1367
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:27,343
On foot?- No, sir. On the cycle...

1368
01:44:30,002 --> 01:44:33,668
He hasn't lost his crazefor a bicycle since childhood.

1369
01:44:35,043 --> 01:44:36,293
Sharma...

1370
01:44:37,127 --> 01:44:40,377
Stop Sharma!- Crazy fellow...

1371
01:44:41,502 --> 01:44:43,338
Sharma!

1372
01:44:43,418 --> 01:44:45,752
Please... please...- Varma move!

1373
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:47,293
Stop him!

1374
01:44:50,793 --> 01:44:54,335
You can't escape from me Sharma,I won't leave you.

1375
01:44:54,668 --> 01:44:58,127
Sharma... let me catch you...- Oh no!

1376
01:44:58,377 --> 01:45:01,710
You are so dead!Sharma, my belt is very long.

1377
01:45:01,793 --> 01:45:05,335
I'll crush and destroy you Sharma.Stop.

1378
01:45:06,668 --> 01:45:11,043
Hey... where are you going?I'll crush you.

1379
01:45:11,752 --> 01:45:13,418
I'll crush you.

1380
01:45:14,002 --> 01:45:14,918
Sharma!

1381
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:16,502
Sharma!

1382
01:45:16,752 --> 01:45:18,127
Where are you?

1383
01:45:18,627 --> 01:45:20,668
Madam Padmaja! Where is thisbloody fellow Sharma?

1384
01:45:21,085 --> 01:45:22,460
Sharma is dead and gone.

1385
01:45:22,668 --> 01:45:24,377
Mr. Sharma is not here, sir.

1386
01:45:24,918 --> 01:45:26,335
He was damn right here till now?

1387
01:45:26,835 --> 01:45:29,752
Like, Sir. I want to tell yousomething but I am afraid, Sir.

1388
01:45:29,877 --> 01:45:30,835
What is it?

1389
01:45:31,168 --> 01:45:34,043
Like....when you were beating him,he jumped out of the window, Sir.

1390
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:39,752
To jump from the tenth floor,is he a Spider Man or Super Man?

1391
01:45:40,127 --> 01:45:43,085
He is a lonely man, sir...very lonely.

1392
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:47,793
If he is lonely, I am manly.

1393
01:45:48,377 --> 01:45:50,293
Wherever he goes,he will have to come back here.

1394
01:45:50,377 --> 01:45:54,043
I will come after an hour.I will see his end.

1395
01:45:55,377 --> 01:45:59,293
Until then the apple of my eye...my belt...

1396
01:46:00,002 --> 01:46:01,543
I'm going to leave it here.

1397
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:03,627
I'm leaving...

1398
01:46:04,877 --> 01:46:06,252
I'm leaving...

1399
01:46:09,585 --> 01:46:10,585
I left.

1400
01:46:14,543 --> 01:46:16,191
He's gone. Thank God!

1401
01:46:22,585 --> 01:46:24,293
This is fear.

1402
01:46:24,627 --> 01:46:25,627
Understood?

1403
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:27,710
See? You got it right.

1404
01:46:36,668 --> 01:46:39,002
Mom! Dad is here.

1405
01:46:45,918 --> 01:46:47,838
Sharma...- Hey!

1406
01:46:47,918 --> 01:46:50,422
Oh, my! Why were you so scared?

1407
01:46:50,502 --> 01:46:53,610
I belong to the leaf andvegetable batch.

1408
01:46:53,835 --> 01:46:57,168
I am not a meat and egg man like you.Nor did I ever see blows and punches.

1409
01:46:57,664 --> 01:47:01,793
To think of his belt,I feel the shivers, Varma!

1410
01:47:03,023 --> 01:47:06,627
What are you saying, Sharma?- As if I don't have a belt!

1411
01:47:06,835 --> 01:47:09,668
To remove it, I was only wary,the trousers may slip down.

1412
01:47:09,793 --> 01:47:12,210
I'm not scared of him...

1413
01:47:12,627 --> 01:47:15,710
Varma! What happened, Varma?- Dad! What happened, Dad!

1414
01:47:15,790 --> 01:47:16,752
Call the doctor!

1415
01:47:16,832 --> 01:47:18,127
Call the doctor...- Get water...

1416
01:47:18,207 --> 01:47:19,192
What happened, dear?

1417
01:47:25,918 --> 01:47:27,085
Oh, dear God.

1418
01:47:29,668 --> 01:47:32,047
You called at the right time.- What happened, doctor?

1419
01:47:32,127 --> 01:47:35,005
With a twisted mouth and a crooked hand...with legs dead and bed ridden...

1420
01:47:35,085 --> 01:47:36,380
they show in the old films...what was that?

1421
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:37,710
Paralysis, sir.

1422
01:47:37,835 --> 01:47:39,252
You are catching up.

1423
01:47:39,668 --> 01:47:41,752
He has some deep rooted fear.

1424
01:47:42,002 --> 01:47:43,335
Dad and fear?

1425
01:47:43,710 --> 01:47:45,252
I thought so too.

1426
01:47:45,710 --> 01:47:47,710
But your Dad doesn't show fearinstantly like me.

1427
01:47:47,918 --> 01:47:51,552
He is too shy.So, he is bed ridden now.

1428
01:47:51,793 --> 01:47:52,994
Can I see Dad once, Doctor?

1429
01:47:53,074 --> 01:47:55,047
Is he the Taj Mahal to buy a ticket to see?

1430
01:47:55,127 --> 01:47:56,713
Your own Dad. You can see himany time. Go ahead.

1431
01:47:56,793 --> 01:47:58,002
Thank you, Doctor.

1432
01:48:02,043 --> 01:48:03,196
Hello Varma...

1433
01:48:03,563 --> 01:48:05,710
How is it now?- How will it be?

1434
01:48:06,815 --> 01:48:09,502
I used to laugh looking at Gummadiand others in movies.

1435
01:48:09,627 --> 01:48:11,293
Now I know...- Dear how are you feeling?

1436
01:48:11,585 --> 01:48:14,002
With one blow we become very slow.

1437
01:48:15,585 --> 01:48:18,752
Why does even that bathroomlook so far away, Sharma?

1438
01:48:18,918 --> 01:48:20,047
I know, Varma.

1439
01:48:20,127 --> 01:48:23,838
We better buy a few shawlsand play with grandsons.

1440
01:48:23,918 --> 01:48:25,960
Talking of grandsons....

1441
01:48:26,293 --> 01:48:28,918
Please leave that Balu, ok?- Why?

1442
01:48:29,710 --> 01:48:32,255
He is Vinda's own son. That's why.

1443
01:48:32,335 --> 01:48:35,210
In that case... shouldn't leave at all.- Why? Why?

1444
01:48:35,293 --> 01:48:37,043
He is stinking rich. That's why.

1445
01:48:37,127 --> 01:48:39,502
We have discussed everything.Brother has told us everything.

1446
01:48:39,668 --> 01:48:42,255
He lied for his father.What's wrong with it?

1447
01:48:42,335 --> 01:48:43,892
But he is beating upyour Dad and the others.

1448
01:48:43,972 --> 01:48:45,463
You find no fault with it?

1449
01:48:45,543 --> 01:48:48,127
Call a man who beats his wife bad,I agree.

1450
01:48:48,210 --> 01:48:48,668
Correct.

1451
01:48:48,752 --> 01:48:50,335
But he who beats the other menis a hero.

1452
01:48:50,418 --> 01:48:52,335
This is correct. - He who beatshis father-in-law is an idiot.

1453
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:54,543
This is correct!- Forget this.

1454
01:48:54,918 --> 01:48:57,297
If you are already in loveor something...

1455
01:48:57,377 --> 01:48:58,793
just give it up in advance...

1456
01:48:59,877 --> 01:49:02,127
I never thought so much till now.

1457
01:49:02,502 --> 01:49:05,085
Now that you ask me to leave himI am suddenly scared.

1458
01:49:05,835 --> 01:49:07,502
That's what love is.

1459
01:49:09,877 --> 01:49:14,002
They say Saturn enters the second roomor the fourth room.

1460
01:49:14,293 --> 01:49:17,532
Look at my fate, Sharma.He is all over my house.

1461
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:23,002
Men have hundred and one problems.We should not bother.

1462
01:49:23,127 --> 01:49:27,543
Ravana abducted Sita. But didMandodari stop attending to him?

1463
01:49:29,210 --> 01:49:32,418
Too much of Epic knowledge.

1464
01:49:33,127 --> 01:49:35,002
I am still talking andyou are going away?

1465
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:38,877
Varma...- What's wrong?

1466
01:49:41,752 --> 01:49:44,710
First throw the belt aside, sister!He is on the verge of dying.

1467
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:50,585
Thank you, Sharma!- You are welcome, Varma!

1468
01:49:51,627 --> 01:49:53,960
Now... Varma's medical...

1469
01:49:54,710 --> 01:49:57,793
Now I'll tell that to cheat Varma,I lied to Sukku.

1470
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:00,418
Tomorrow I'll tell Kantham thatto cheat Sharma, I lied to her.

1471
01:50:00,502 --> 01:50:02,213
Greetings, son.- Hey, Sharma uncle...

1472
01:50:02,293 --> 01:50:03,212
Greetings.

1473
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:04,359
You said you were takingme to Varma's house.

1474
01:50:04,439 --> 01:50:06,002
But why did we come to Sharma's place.

1475
01:50:06,168 --> 01:50:07,460
You should have checked the address!

1476
01:50:07,710 --> 01:50:09,838
This is Mr. Varma's house, sir.

1477
01:50:09,918 --> 01:50:12,335
Wow! How huge!

1478
01:50:12,418 --> 01:50:13,797
We can happily cyclearound here, you know?

1479
01:50:13,877 --> 01:50:15,793
You are pedaling in the officewhy here, son?

1480
01:50:16,377 --> 01:50:18,918
No... I was just sayingyou would be tired.

1481
01:50:20,085 --> 01:50:24,002
See... he talks all bad!- Don't be disappointed for no reason!

1482
01:50:24,127 --> 01:50:27,002
Here... cycle in the officefrom Monday through Friday.

1483
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:29,210
Use this house at weekends.- Ok.

1484
01:50:29,335 --> 01:50:32,127
So, only the office...we have no holiday?

1485
01:50:32,377 --> 01:50:33,502
It looks good...

1486
01:50:35,377 --> 01:50:36,960
Uncle, Aunty is here...

1487
01:50:41,293 --> 01:50:43,668
How come uncle?They said Mr. Varma is not well.

1488
01:50:43,752 --> 01:50:45,543
But they seem dressed for movie.

1489
01:50:45,752 --> 01:50:47,585
How do we know their family affairs?

1490
01:50:47,668 --> 01:50:48,918
May be the husband and wifedon't see eye to eye.

1491
01:50:49,002 --> 01:50:51,710
Probably they applied for a divorce.May be they already got it!

1492
01:50:51,793 --> 01:50:53,098
Oh, no!

1493
01:50:53,293 --> 01:50:54,418
Nothing of that sort.

1494
01:50:54,543 --> 01:50:57,547
We thought if we are well, he will be well.So we got ready well.

1495
01:50:57,627 --> 01:51:00,877
Moreover... our tears hardlymake him better.

1496
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,793
Only medicines make him better.

1497
01:51:05,668 --> 01:51:07,502
What is the actual problem, doctor?

1498
01:51:07,793 --> 01:51:10,335
Do you know Ravindra Jadejaand Ravichandran Ashwin?

1499
01:51:10,418 --> 01:51:11,377
Spinners!

1500
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:13,755
When they bowl how does their hand turn?-In twists...

1501
01:51:13,835 --> 01:51:14,752
That's what happened to his hand.

1502
01:51:15,002 --> 01:51:17,168
Once the ball is bowled,their hands become normal.

1503
01:51:17,293 --> 01:51:19,747
He needs medicines to bring it to normal.- Oh...

1504
01:51:20,585 --> 01:51:23,835
So, as per your analysis...this is paralysis?

1505
01:51:23,918 --> 01:51:24,960
Exactly.

1506
01:51:25,179 --> 01:51:28,377
Maybe it will work out if we switch himfrom bowling to batting.

1507
01:51:32,002 --> 01:51:34,335
Uncle is using a shawl even in summer!

1508
01:51:34,543 --> 01:51:37,168
Am I not wearing a muffler?Every man has his own passion.

1509
01:51:37,335 --> 01:51:39,918
Only his passion is bigger than mine.That's all.

1510
01:51:40,877 --> 01:51:42,585
Hello, Uncle! How are you?

1511
01:51:44,252 --> 01:51:47,168
People like you steppinginto my house...

1512
01:51:47,335 --> 01:51:49,252
Oho... has become very slow.

1513
01:51:49,418 --> 01:51:52,168
Wasn't the stroke quite big, uncle?- He doesn't listen to me

1514
01:51:52,293 --> 01:51:53,960
Refuses to take medicines.- Listen uncle...

1515
01:51:54,210 --> 01:51:55,168
Kumari aunty...

1516
01:51:55,418 --> 01:51:58,377
I need to talk to Sukku.Can I use your bedroom?

1517
01:51:59,002 --> 01:52:01,335
Of course! Please go.

1518
01:52:01,668 --> 01:52:02,918
Sukku! Take me.

1519
01:52:05,502 --> 01:52:06,543
Uncle...

1520
01:52:09,085 --> 01:52:11,877
My house has turned into a lodge, Sharma.

1521
01:52:12,293 --> 01:52:15,835
Like the tabla complaining to the drums,why are you telling me, Varma?

1522
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:21,389
Out of anger against your dad thinkinghe had killed my dad,

1523
01:52:21,469 --> 01:52:22,960
I lied to you Ms Sukku.

1524
01:52:23,168 --> 01:52:26,543
Out of love for me, you are telling methe truth now. That's enough for me.

1525
01:52:27,168 --> 01:52:30,752
Like.. Ms Sukku.. right from the beginningI wasn't the bathroom Balu...

1526
01:52:30,835 --> 01:52:32,627
That's not me...- You don't need to explain...

1527
01:52:32,793 --> 01:52:35,168
I know you are Abhi in office, Mr. Abhi.

1528
01:52:36,668 --> 01:52:38,835
I don't know how to face you, Ms Sukku.

1529
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:40,110
How?

1530
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:45,168
Why do you have to face me?Just hug me.

1531
01:52:53,793 --> 01:52:56,460
Have I made a mistake, Mr. Abhi?

1532
01:52:57,085 --> 01:52:58,127
Nothing wrong...

1533
01:52:58,502 --> 01:52:59,960
Instead of across the bed,

1534
01:53:00,043 --> 01:53:04,460
Had you come to this side, you would'vebeen more comfortable.

1535
01:53:07,877 --> 01:53:08,752
Dear...

1536
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:10,960
The boy has almost becomeour husband!

1537
01:53:11,085 --> 01:53:14,502
Though by mistake,she said it right, Sharma.

1538
01:53:14,793 --> 01:53:16,543
Not only for my daughter,

1539
01:53:17,085 --> 01:53:18,585
he will be a husband for all of us.

1540
01:53:21,335 --> 01:53:22,168
Come dear...

1541
01:53:23,043 --> 01:53:25,460
Varma Uncle... see you aunty.

1542
01:53:26,168 --> 01:53:28,293
Sharma uncle... you too.- Fine, son.

1543
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:31,002
So you left the girl for good?- Totally...

1544
01:53:31,335 --> 01:53:32,127
Abhi...

1545
01:53:34,502 --> 01:53:36,418
Dear, just see this...

1546
01:53:37,918 --> 01:53:39,210
Good boy.

1547
01:53:39,543 --> 01:53:40,793
Unbridled...

1548
01:53:40,873 --> 01:53:41,895
Bye.

1549
01:53:43,085 --> 01:53:45,168
From my side.- I know, I can see.

1550
01:53:45,293 --> 01:53:46,210
Let's go uncle..- Come on...

1551
01:53:46,377 --> 01:53:48,502
Bye aunty... Bye uncle...- Bye.

1552
01:53:49,002 --> 01:53:50,127
Sharma...

1553
01:53:50,377 --> 01:53:51,418
Varma...

1554
01:53:51,668 --> 01:53:52,627
Karma.

1555
01:53:58,002 --> 01:53:59,543
Sir?- Two coffee...

1556
01:54:01,085 --> 01:54:04,418
I am not angryfor what you've done.

1557
01:54:05,377 --> 01:54:07,627
Actually, I'm happy.

1558
01:54:08,043 --> 01:54:12,252
Among so many in the office,you've selected me.

1559
01:54:12,752 --> 01:54:14,752
That shows how special I am.

1560
01:54:16,502 --> 01:54:20,460
With half million cash in hand,that Rohit turned so rude.

1561
01:54:20,752 --> 01:54:23,877
You own such a huge companyyet you are so simple!

1562
01:54:25,168 --> 01:54:27,293
We'll meet in the office tomorrow... ok?

1563
01:54:35,293 --> 01:54:36,043
Abhi...

1564
01:54:37,627 --> 01:54:38,793
I love you.

1565
01:54:46,025 --> 01:54:47,793
Oh God!

1566
01:54:48,293 --> 01:54:52,321
I'm late by ten minutesbecause of paralysis,

1567
01:54:52,401 --> 01:54:54,127
and he turns off the elevator.

1568
01:54:54,443 --> 01:54:56,668
What does he think of himself, Sharma?

1569
01:54:57,210 --> 01:54:59,460
I saw people climbing up the stairs...

1570
01:54:59,543 --> 01:55:02,543
We are the only people to dieclimbing the stairs, Varma.

1571
01:55:02,877 --> 01:55:04,210
That's the beauty.

1572
01:55:04,293 --> 01:55:07,127
Where is the beauty in this Varma,we are dying!

1573
01:55:12,735 --> 01:55:14,650
Good morning, sir.- Good morning, sir.

1574
01:55:27,627 --> 01:55:28,752
Uncles!

1575
01:55:29,252 --> 01:55:30,877
Looks like you still maintainyesterday's displeasure.

1576
01:55:31,002 --> 01:55:33,339
Oh, no! No displeasure...no anger.

1577
01:55:33,419 --> 01:55:36,005
It's the young blood! Two wordsand a few blows.

1578
01:55:36,085 --> 01:55:37,335
Will you stop talking?

1579
01:55:38,043 --> 01:55:40,377
He thrashes us andthen cries over it!

1580
01:55:40,502 --> 01:55:41,847
What can we say?

1581
01:55:43,668 --> 01:55:48,415
Uncle! Why do you keep beatingthe dead snake again and again?

1582
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:51,002
Balu...

1583
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:52,793
Sir, please drink.

1584
01:55:52,918 --> 01:55:54,543
Dear...you saved us.Give some water.

1585
01:55:59,043 --> 01:56:00,460
I understand something.- What is that?

1586
01:56:00,543 --> 01:56:02,085
You are on a streak.

1587
01:56:02,168 --> 01:56:03,877
You are trampling whoever standsin your way.

1588
01:56:04,043 --> 01:56:05,627
So listen...

1589
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:10,127
keep the belt on your pantand keep us by your side.

1590
01:56:10,252 --> 01:56:13,502
Beat whomever you want...see if we don't clap.

1591
01:56:17,752 --> 01:56:19,002
Hi, Rekha.

1592
01:56:19,710 --> 01:56:21,168
Continuity, thanks.

1593
01:56:21,627 --> 01:56:22,543
He is done.

1594
01:56:22,835 --> 01:56:23,627
Hey...

1595
01:56:24,418 --> 01:56:26,002
You told them to stop the elevator?

1596
01:56:26,543 --> 01:56:27,585
I gave two blows.

1597
01:56:28,252 --> 01:56:29,335
He switched it on again himself.

1598
01:56:29,710 --> 01:56:30,335
Here...

1599
01:56:31,002 --> 01:56:34,002
Here, Board Director Seetaramissued reappointment letter.

1600
01:56:35,002 --> 01:56:37,585
What do you think of this guy, Varma?

1601
01:56:38,585 --> 01:56:43,502
Lion has invited for dinner andthe buck has arrived dressed in jeans.

1602
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:46,460
Look... especially read the fifth line.

1603
01:56:47,002 --> 01:56:51,543
For the four days of my removal he askedyou to compensate with two months salary...

1604
01:56:51,710 --> 01:56:52,630
Ya!

1605
01:56:52,710 --> 01:56:54,253
Tell him.

1606
01:56:55,835 --> 01:56:58,668
Hey! Monster! Villain!I don't even have an extra copy.

1607
01:56:58,835 --> 01:57:00,960
Oh, my! He has ruined me.

1608
01:57:02,335 --> 01:57:04,960
Hey! To destroy people like you,

1609
01:57:05,085 --> 01:57:07,293
God will appear in some form.

1610
01:57:17,502 --> 01:57:18,835
What happened to the pen, Sharma?

1611
01:57:18,918 --> 01:57:21,210
Look for it in the morning.- Oh no!

1612
01:57:39,835 --> 01:57:41,210
You were saying Godwas on the way!

1613
01:57:41,418 --> 01:57:42,877
There is no God. So he won't come.

1614
01:57:43,002 --> 01:57:44,543
Ladies! Belts please.

1615
01:57:49,543 --> 01:57:51,002
Only one belt for you, Sharma.

1616
01:57:51,210 --> 01:57:52,377
Look how many for him!

1617
01:57:52,627 --> 01:57:56,752
Lucky people get everything in bundles.- That's the beauty.

1618
01:57:57,377 --> 01:58:01,335
Until the last belt here snaps,skin him alive.

1619
01:58:01,627 --> 01:58:03,543
Oh no!- Stop!

1620
01:58:06,168 --> 01:58:07,252
Thank God.

1621
01:58:07,668 --> 01:58:09,335
Amongst all the women over here...

1622
01:58:09,627 --> 01:58:11,627
You are the only one with humanity.

1623
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:14,210
You saved me...Thanks Ms Kantham.

1624
01:58:19,293 --> 01:58:20,130
Beat him now!

1625
01:58:20,210 --> 01:58:22,335
This is cheating!- My darling Kantham!

1626
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:24,543
This fellow...- No!

1627
01:58:25,210 --> 01:58:26,963
This fellow should not bebeaten just like that.

1628
01:58:27,043 --> 01:58:28,547
There should be a rhythm.

1629
01:58:28,627 --> 01:58:30,088
There should be a dance and a song.

1630
01:58:30,168 --> 01:58:32,210
In fact it should be rememberedlike a festival.

1631
01:58:50,710 --> 01:58:52,460
Wow... wow... Sharma!

1632
01:58:52,668 --> 01:58:53,960
You haven't lost touch.- Thanks son.

1633
01:58:54,043 --> 01:58:55,418
Continue... continue...

1634
01:59:03,458 --> 01:59:05,127
Darling Tukaram!- Sir!

1635
01:59:05,585 --> 01:59:07,168
One glass of milk with pepper...

1636
01:59:07,469 --> 01:59:09,335
If not expensive add two cardamoms.

1637
01:59:09,418 --> 01:59:10,820
Let's rock it, sir.

1638
01:59:17,418 --> 01:59:19,585
Sharma Sir! What am I singing?What are you playing?

1639
01:59:19,665 --> 01:59:22,085
You just said you liked it...?- It was then... not now.

1640
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:24,710
Sorry Kantham, I can't compromiseon the quality.

1641
01:59:24,835 --> 01:59:26,289
I just can't.

1642
01:59:26,851 --> 01:59:29,918
To match my speed, isn't therea single talented young musician?

1643
01:59:37,002 --> 01:59:38,516
Wow, boy!

1644
02:00:44,842 --> 02:00:49,306
You stupid fellow!

1645
02:01:39,335 --> 02:01:42,252
Padmaja, looks like you didn't haveyour lunch, so you're not singing loudly.

1646
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:48,752
All the sisters in unison!

1647
02:02:01,752 --> 02:02:05,293
You think girls are cakes on displayat the cafeteria to eat immediately?

1648
02:02:05,835 --> 02:02:07,543
Ten minutes of floggingand you scream so much.

1649
02:02:07,835 --> 02:02:10,877
You've been hitting them for ten years...never heard their screams?

1650
02:02:11,835 --> 02:02:14,377
Not you, man... the one whorecommended you for the job?

1651
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:16,085
Him... He should be blamed.

1652
02:02:16,668 --> 02:02:17,505
Who is he?

1653
02:02:17,585 --> 02:02:19,502
Who is he?- Seetaram... Seetaram...

1654
02:02:19,585 --> 02:02:20,918
Seetaram... Seetaram...

1655
02:02:21,668 --> 02:02:23,005
Varma and Sharma...- Son...

1656
02:02:23,085 --> 02:02:24,502
Call for a Board Meeting tomorrow.

1657
02:02:24,627 --> 02:02:27,335
Telephone or exchange...I don't know what you will do...

1658
02:02:27,418 --> 02:02:29,210
But the whole Board must be present.- Ok sir.

1659
02:02:29,335 --> 02:02:31,668
And he should be ousted from the board.That is my resolution.

1660
02:02:31,752 --> 02:02:33,751
Understood!?- Right, sir.

1661
02:02:36,002 --> 02:02:37,523
Get out!

1662
02:03:20,702 --> 02:03:22,868
Is he going to get on tothe bicycle again?

1663
02:03:23,202 --> 02:03:26,577
Let him get on to anythingexcept us.

1664
02:03:27,368 --> 02:03:31,202
His acts are beyond imagination, Varma.- That's the beauty.

1665
02:03:31,785 --> 02:03:34,202
That chair... isn't it over sized?

1666
02:03:35,368 --> 02:03:38,035
I only put down a little,it adds value to the place we occupy.

1667
02:03:38,535 --> 02:03:39,993
So I went on a diet.

1668
02:03:40,368 --> 02:03:41,160
Oh!

1669
02:03:42,577 --> 02:03:44,368
By the way... I am Seetaram

1670
02:03:44,535 --> 02:03:47,202
and I've got something for you.

1671
02:03:59,868 --> 02:04:01,577
I don't need introduction, right?

1672
02:04:03,285 --> 02:04:05,202
Abhishikta Bhargav... AB.

1673
02:04:05,827 --> 02:04:08,452
Vinda's secret Plan B.

1674
02:04:12,493 --> 02:04:14,243
Slowed by arthritis...

1675
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:16,368
Stilled by hyper tension

1676
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:21,160
With no man in the family and fear...some of them might have agreed.

1677
02:04:23,535 --> 02:04:25,788
But what about our shareholders,investors and workers?

1678
02:04:25,868 --> 02:04:27,535
When if they ask...what do we say?

1679
02:04:27,910 --> 02:04:29,785
Whoever raises a voice,do we keep hitting them?

1680
02:04:32,702 --> 02:04:35,327
Violence is not an option.

1681
02:04:35,910 --> 02:04:36,993
What else then?

1682
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:38,368
A piece of paper.

1683
02:04:39,660 --> 02:04:41,285
With a stamp on an A4 sheet.

1684
02:04:41,452 --> 02:04:44,868
If there is a note signed by Vindasaying he is the son...

1685
02:04:45,118 --> 02:04:46,827
Present it in the General Body Meeting.

1686
02:04:47,202 --> 02:04:51,118
If they still ask questions,use the same belt on them.

1687
02:05:09,493 --> 02:05:12,077
Evidence means... Birth Certificate...

1688
02:05:12,327 --> 02:05:15,868
Abhi's school admission formwith Vinda's signature.

1689
02:05:16,577 --> 02:05:23,118
Or for some medical treatmentVinda's authorization to the doctor...

1690
02:05:24,118 --> 02:05:26,618
Anything of that sort will suffice.

1691
02:05:27,118 --> 02:05:31,660
Stating Abhishikta as his elder sonand the share to be allotted....

1692
02:05:32,035 --> 02:05:33,535
There is a will that Vinda had written.

1693
02:05:33,785 --> 02:05:36,118
Being more fond of Abhi thanher own son,

1694
02:05:36,285 --> 02:05:39,910
She added her own sharein the will and got it registered.

1695
02:05:41,243 --> 02:05:42,410
Will that do?

1696
02:05:46,118 --> 02:05:49,618
I've earned a lot of enemiesalong with wealth, Abhi.

1697
02:05:50,202 --> 02:05:52,577
I cannot hide my wealth.

1698
02:05:53,160 --> 02:05:57,077
But the Will ascribing all rightsto you all, I could hide.

1699
02:05:58,577 --> 02:06:01,493
This chain will tell youwhere it is located.

1700
02:06:04,410 --> 02:06:07,577
The key to open thewill is in this watch.

1701
02:06:09,868 --> 02:06:12,952
Unless you two are together,you won't be able to read it.

1702
02:06:13,368 --> 02:06:16,618
I hope such a day would never come.

1703
02:06:17,077 --> 02:06:18,827
If it does,

1704
02:06:19,785 --> 02:06:22,368
It means our family is in danger.

1705
02:08:39,077 --> 02:08:41,702
Hey, how do you know Abhi?

1706
02:08:44,827 --> 02:08:46,202
We are colleagues!

1707
02:08:51,368 --> 02:08:52,410
How do you know him?

1708
02:08:52,743 --> 02:08:55,785
He came looking for meand fell in love.

1709
02:08:56,243 --> 02:08:57,160
Love?

1710
02:08:58,493 --> 02:09:01,327
Just because it's just one syllable,don't use it as you like.

1711
02:09:03,285 --> 02:09:04,952
Mom... Dad...

1712
02:09:05,743 --> 02:09:07,327
These are one syllable words too.

1713
02:09:08,910 --> 02:09:10,077
I will use.

1714
02:09:11,035 --> 02:09:12,993
You talk too much.

1715
02:09:14,368 --> 02:09:18,743
You look like a noodle.I am like the noodle holding fork.

1716
02:09:18,910 --> 02:09:20,160
Really?

1717
02:09:20,452 --> 02:09:21,327
Really?

1718
02:09:23,493 --> 02:09:25,785
How dare you hit me?

1719
02:09:27,493 --> 02:09:28,410
You hit me?

1720
02:09:28,702 --> 02:09:30,035
You bloody hit me?

1721
02:09:31,243 --> 02:09:32,535
Abhi... Abhi...

1722
02:09:32,702 --> 02:09:34,702
Sshhh...

1723
02:09:38,368 --> 02:09:39,827
Oh my God!

1724
02:09:40,702 --> 02:09:43,243
Ok, Ok, my bad... my bad...

1725
02:09:43,327 --> 02:09:44,452
Peace... peace...

1726
02:09:44,577 --> 02:09:45,368
Peace.

1727
02:09:46,535 --> 02:09:48,452
Ok. ok.- Peace!

1728
02:09:50,535 --> 02:09:51,493
You wanna fight?

1729
02:09:51,827 --> 02:09:53,743
Do you want to fight with me?you moron.

1730
02:09:53,993 --> 02:09:54,452
Come.

1731
02:09:57,327 --> 02:09:58,785
I'll kill you.- Hey. Hey.

1732
02:09:58,993 --> 02:10:00,743
What do you think? Huh!

1733
02:10:00,823 --> 02:10:02,830
You...!

1734
02:10:02,910 --> 02:10:06,940
Hey! Hey! Hey!Stop! Stop!

1735
02:10:18,734 --> 02:10:21,004
Stop it! Stop it!

1736
02:12:47,077 --> 02:12:48,243
Abhi!

1737
02:12:50,618 --> 02:12:51,288
Come.

1738
02:12:51,368 --> 02:12:52,702
Come. Come.- Get in fast!

1739
02:12:52,868 --> 02:12:55,077
Let's go! Go! Fast!

1740
02:14:53,868 --> 02:14:55,160
Abhi.- Hmmm?

1741
02:15:02,952 --> 02:15:04,202
I love you.- Abhi...

1742
02:15:05,702 --> 02:15:06,827
I love you more.

1743
02:15:15,035 --> 02:15:16,368
Welcome to The Business News Hour,

To elect their new CEO.

1746
02:15:21,910 --> 02:15:24,285
The entire business world is waitingwith bated breath

1747
02:15:24,368 --> 02:15:27,493
To see who will be the successorof Govinda Bhargav, The Pharma giant.

1748
02:15:27,952 --> 02:15:31,452
The interim CEO, Mrs. Indrani Bhargavwill lead the meeting tomorrow.

1749
02:15:31,618 --> 02:15:33,952
Stay with us for moreinformation on this.

1750
02:15:50,952 --> 02:15:53,202
The will is in your hands.

1751
02:15:53,743 --> 02:15:55,452
Vinda's son is not in the city.

1752
02:15:56,077 --> 02:15:58,035
Tomorrow is the General Body Meeting.

1753
02:15:58,577 --> 02:16:01,910
No one can stop Seetaram.- Why do you need me?

1754
02:16:03,993 --> 02:16:05,368
We're unable to open the box...

1755
02:16:06,827 --> 02:16:08,327
Break it open.

1756
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:11,993
What if there are some sensors inside

1757
02:16:12,452 --> 02:16:15,035
To project the will on the Company websiteas soon as the box is broken?

1758
02:16:17,118 --> 02:16:18,577
We can never trust technology.

1759
02:16:19,577 --> 02:16:22,660
Vinda can never be trusted.

1760
02:16:23,493 --> 02:16:25,452
If you want the password,

1761
02:16:26,660 --> 02:16:28,743
my passbook has to beupdated with cash.

1762
02:16:31,327 --> 02:16:33,118
Why the wasteful expenditure?

1763
02:16:33,493 --> 02:16:35,952
I am buying an elephant.Will I bargain over the tether?

1764
02:16:40,077 --> 02:16:42,202
It's just a tether... but made of gold.

1765
02:16:42,452 --> 02:16:43,618
A bit expensive.

1766
02:16:46,743 --> 02:16:47,743
Quote the price.

1767
02:16:47,993 --> 02:16:49,993
Ten crores. Fresh currency.

1768
02:17:25,410 --> 02:17:28,077
We thought he would kill themthat's why we deceived Abhi...

1769
02:17:28,202 --> 02:17:29,077
Why should you?

1770
02:17:29,368 --> 02:17:31,493
For them to live, you deceived.

1771
02:17:31,702 --> 02:17:34,118
For me to live well, I deceived.

1772
02:17:38,118 --> 02:17:39,035
Shut up!

1773
02:17:39,618 --> 02:17:40,993
Enough! Shut up!

1774
02:17:41,743 --> 02:17:42,868
Not bad, Parag.

1775
02:17:43,493 --> 02:17:44,618
Continue with the same aim.

1776
02:17:45,535 --> 02:17:49,285
Mr. Varma and Mr. Sharma will votefor me as the CEO tomorrow.

1777
02:17:50,993 --> 02:17:53,202
All you need is a gun in handand a head at the other end,

1778
02:17:53,910 --> 02:17:55,327
We can do anything, right?

1779
02:17:56,577 --> 02:17:58,243
That's the beauty.

1780
02:18:12,618 --> 02:18:15,535
Office is surrounded with Seetaram's men.- All that security is to stop you.

1781
02:18:19,243 --> 02:18:21,827
A ten rupee sandwich...I thought it would hardly be a roll.

1782
02:18:21,993 --> 02:18:23,410
But the taste is mind blowing.

1783
02:18:25,393 --> 02:18:27,368
Skimmed milk and no cheese.- Without cheese?!

1784
02:18:27,702 --> 02:18:29,160
You want one?- Yes.

1785
02:18:34,368 --> 02:18:35,202
Brother!

1786
02:18:35,618 --> 02:18:38,118
They said ten rupee a sandwich here.- Do you have change for 500?

1787
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:43,202
His life is going to changeand he says he needs change.

1788
02:18:43,327 --> 02:18:45,618
Stupidity, I tell you!- So true.

1789
02:18:46,660 --> 02:18:48,868
Another chair!- And a rope.

1790
02:18:51,993 --> 02:18:53,660
I imagined something else,when they said it's a special offer, bro.

1791
02:18:53,785 --> 02:18:56,285
We at least have clothes.This guy doesn't even have those.

1792
02:18:56,368 --> 02:18:57,868
That is the special offer, bro.

1793
02:19:07,243 --> 02:19:08,275
Alpha come in.

1794
02:19:34,441 --> 02:19:35,983
Pleasure.- Sir, Parag.

1795
02:19:36,650 --> 02:19:37,400
Excuse me...

1796
02:19:38,400 --> 02:19:38,986
Ya Parag.

1797
02:19:39,066 --> 02:19:41,941
Sir, Abhi is with us,we are taking him to the terrace

1798
02:19:42,021 --> 02:19:45,233
The voting is bloody going to start.Do it fast.

1799
02:20:39,983 --> 02:20:41,150
Oh no...!

1800
02:20:42,608 --> 02:20:44,066
Throw the knife away... throw it!

1801
02:20:44,150 --> 02:20:45,066
Oh dear...

1802
02:20:45,900 --> 02:20:48,858
Hey... like her... don't hand over the gunto him because you are idle.

1803
02:20:52,275 --> 02:20:54,900
That's the beauty.- Sorry, Dad.

1804
02:21:02,458 --> 02:21:04,150
Dad!

1805
02:21:45,809 --> 02:21:46,816
Parag! You there?

1806
02:21:51,316 --> 02:21:52,108
Parag.

1807
02:21:52,608 --> 02:21:53,441
Can you hear me?

1808
02:21:59,108 --> 02:22:02,361
First stop crying and wrap somethingaround my arm, please.

1809
02:22:02,441 --> 02:22:04,400
Oh! There are no clothes here.

1810
02:22:04,733 --> 02:22:08,316
You have a tie!- Oh dear! Don't kill me.

1811
02:22:09,108 --> 02:22:12,861
Hey... you are wearing such a long gown!Tear a piece, please.

1812
02:22:12,941 --> 02:22:14,025
This is a new one, Dad!

1813
02:22:14,150 --> 02:22:17,486
Keep your dad alive and he willbuy you thousands of those.

1814
02:22:17,566 --> 02:22:19,400
Tear it... Tear it dear.

1815
02:22:19,483 --> 02:22:22,650
Hello everybody, I'm pleased to welcomeall of you to the General Body Meeting

1816
02:22:22,775 --> 02:22:24,066
Of the AB Group of industries.

1817
02:22:24,191 --> 02:22:27,108
Now I invite Indrani Bhargav,wife of Govinda Bhargav

1818
02:22:27,191 --> 02:22:30,233
On the stage, to start the votingfor the election of our new CEO.

1819
02:23:20,775 --> 02:23:23,108
To expose me you usedVarma and Sharma,

1820
02:23:23,691 --> 02:23:25,608
To expose you, I used my uncle.

1821
02:23:29,608 --> 02:23:32,108
How did both the girls reach the place,where I was trying to get the Will from.

1822
02:23:32,188 --> 02:23:34,733
How did Seetaram know about the placefor him to send them.

1823
02:23:35,025 --> 02:23:35,941
You must've told him.

1824
02:23:36,066 --> 02:23:38,733
That's why I sent that willwith my uncle.

1825
02:23:39,108 --> 02:23:41,483
You won't show up until the Willis destroyed completely.

1826
02:23:42,358 --> 02:23:44,941
The one that you've seenand burnt yesterday was a fake.

1827
02:23:51,983 --> 02:23:53,233
This is the actual will.

1828
02:23:53,566 --> 02:23:54,858
My plan B.

1829
02:23:55,163 --> 02:23:58,150
Just like your father...- What did my dad do to you?

1830
02:23:59,739 --> 02:24:02,150
He gave you a place on the Boardand a share in our Company.

1831
02:24:02,900 --> 02:24:05,233
But not his hand whenmy elder brother was asking for it.

1832
02:24:05,358 --> 02:24:08,233
They will kill me Vinda,let me come inside.

1833
02:24:08,608 --> 02:24:09,858
Stop!

1834
02:24:11,650 --> 02:24:13,108
Vinda!

1835
02:24:15,566 --> 02:24:23,275
Mercilessly left him to anangry mob hurling stones.

1836
02:24:25,650 --> 02:24:29,275
As they trampled on my brother,he shut the door on his face.

1837
02:24:33,275 --> 02:24:38,441
This is an empire your dad builton a friend's grave.

1838
02:24:38,983 --> 02:24:41,233
It's no better than a burial ground to me.

1839
02:24:41,733 --> 02:24:44,816
It's a recreation chamber of the monsterwho killed my brother.

1840
02:24:49,191 --> 02:24:50,691
Govinda Bhargav...

1841
02:24:51,608 --> 02:24:52,441
Vinda...

1842
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:55,566
Beyond this business empire...

1843
02:24:56,066 --> 02:24:59,983
Far away from these board room relations,what did he hide...

1844
02:25:00,900 --> 02:25:02,316
I need to tell you about that.

1845
02:25:02,733 --> 02:25:05,233
32 calendars of humanity...

1846
02:25:05,816 --> 02:25:08,483
5 feet 10 inches of honesty...

1847
02:25:08,900 --> 02:25:12,025
140 pounds of trust

1848
02:25:12,858 --> 02:25:14,358
His elder son...

1849
02:25:15,775 --> 02:25:17,566
You must know about him.

1850
02:25:20,383 --> 02:25:24,400
All these 25 years, I never thoughtof your Company.

1851
02:25:24,816 --> 02:25:29,483
How to kill your father...that was the only thought.

1852
02:25:30,214 --> 02:25:32,650
You lost your brother and soyou developed grudge on my dad.

1853
02:25:33,483 --> 02:25:36,275
But you tried killing meeven as I was just fetus.

1854
02:25:36,802 --> 02:25:38,150
How should I retaliate?

1855
02:25:39,002 --> 02:25:41,233
Holding a knife, should I search for you?

1856
02:25:43,025 --> 02:25:45,611
If we keep getting harder withevery close death,

1857
02:25:45,691 --> 02:25:47,650
this world would be filled with stones.

1858
02:25:49,608 --> 02:25:53,483
And...is there ever a deathless homeor a tearless family?

1859
02:25:54,233 --> 02:25:58,775
After the mother's death when anotherwoman enters the father's life,

1860
02:25:59,441 --> 02:26:01,525
she is hated for no reason.

1861
02:26:02,941 --> 02:26:08,733
They created a synonymfor step-mother...demon.

1862
02:26:09,358 --> 02:26:11,733
But he never treated me that way.

1863
02:26:12,608 --> 02:26:15,525
My own son might've showedannoyance towards me...

1864
02:26:16,441 --> 02:26:20,233
But he never belittled me.

1865
02:26:20,733 --> 02:26:24,066
Behind the door my dad had closed,you only see your dead brother.

1866
02:26:24,941 --> 02:26:28,483
But not the families he gave life toor the lamps he lighted.

1867
02:26:28,983 --> 02:26:31,191
You didn't! You can't!

1868
02:26:31,650 --> 02:26:32,900
Why should I?

1869
02:26:33,566 --> 02:26:37,108
Expecting to have a son, decidingto name him as Abhishikta Bhargav...

1870
02:26:37,233 --> 02:26:40,566
your Dad had floated the AB Company.

1871
02:26:40,740 --> 02:26:42,691
He was an ordinary businessman.

1872
02:26:43,400 --> 02:26:45,108
Don't make a God of him.

1873
02:26:45,452 --> 02:26:48,316
Vinda is not an ordinary businessman.

1874
02:26:49,154 --> 02:26:50,608
He is a visionary.

1875
02:26:52,191 --> 02:26:54,400
He would always tell me....

1876
02:26:55,025 --> 02:26:58,150
To start a business,you should be intelligent.

1877
02:26:58,733 --> 02:27:01,233
To develop the business,you should be disciplined.

1878
02:27:01,900 --> 02:27:04,733
Once it is developed, you should be kind.

1879
02:27:05,858 --> 02:27:09,483
There may be several people heremore intelligent than my son.

1880
02:27:11,964 --> 02:27:16,691
But kinder than him? Definitely no!

1881
02:27:20,066 --> 02:27:22,316
With 50,000 employees under him,

1882
02:27:22,779 --> 02:27:24,775
How much love should one havefor a human being?

1883
02:27:25,691 --> 02:27:27,400
Only he has it.

1884
02:27:27,816 --> 02:27:30,275
He is a king raised among commoners.

1885
02:27:31,003 --> 02:27:33,316
He is a millionaire moving withthe laborers.

1886
02:27:33,693 --> 02:27:35,775
Govinda Bhargav's elder son.

1887
02:27:36,357 --> 02:27:38,941
Krishnaveni's own son.

1888
02:27:39,973 --> 02:27:41,608
The son I raised.

1889
02:27:42,611 --> 02:27:44,233
Abhishikta Bhargav!

1890
02:27:45,180 --> 02:27:49,025
Nominating him as the CEO,I begin the election process.

1891
02:27:49,483 --> 02:27:52,483
The first vote is mine.- Second vote is mine.

1892
02:28:14,608 --> 02:28:17,066
I've done nothing wrong.I won't face any punishment.

1893
02:28:17,191 --> 02:28:19,025
Parag... Parag...

1894
02:28:19,275 --> 02:28:20,358
So late?

1895
02:28:20,733 --> 02:28:23,150
The voting has alreadystarted downstairs.

1896
02:28:24,941 --> 02:28:26,733
To hell with the voting...

1897
02:28:27,483 --> 02:28:30,066
You becoming the CEO is notimportant to me.

1898
02:29:16,424 --> 02:29:20,275
To occupy the seat after the father...this is not a throne. It's a CEO chair.

1899
02:29:22,691 --> 02:29:24,441
You should have a qualification.

1900
02:29:26,150 --> 02:29:28,191
And what is that? Killing people?

1901
02:29:28,441 --> 02:29:29,191
Ok.

1902
02:29:30,108 --> 02:29:33,400
Hawaii... Panama... Caribbean...spell your interest...

1903
02:29:34,202 --> 02:29:35,858
I'll buy you an island.

1904
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:40,525
30 years you lived unexposed.

1905
02:29:41,483 --> 02:29:44,483
Live the remaining happilywithout any hardwork.

1906
02:29:45,025 --> 02:29:47,233
I will buy you two.You give it up.

1907
02:31:01,983 --> 02:31:04,066
Vinda!

1908
02:31:08,275 --> 02:31:09,441
Vinda...

1909
02:31:09,775 --> 02:31:11,525
That chair belongs to me.

1910
02:31:11,805 --> 02:31:14,275
Give it to me...!

1911
02:31:19,458 --> 02:31:21,733
To gain power neither sizenor age matters....

1912
02:31:23,169 --> 02:31:24,733
This is required.

1913
02:31:26,369 --> 02:31:27,733
He said sorry.

1914
02:31:40,723 --> 02:31:42,941
AB is not the name of Vinda's future son.

1915
02:31:43,439 --> 02:31:45,358
It is the name of his departed friend.

1916
02:31:46,595 --> 02:31:48,066
Your brother's name...

1917
02:31:48,342 --> 02:31:49,816
Aditya Bandaru.

1918
02:31:57,900 --> 02:32:00,233
Vinda!!

1919
02:32:01,307 --> 02:32:03,691
Daya... Daya... Daya... Daya...

1920
02:32:04,550 --> 02:32:07,608
This is not an empire builton a friend's grave...

1921
02:32:07,932 --> 02:32:10,983
This is a memorial commemorating a friend.

1922
02:33:18,161 --> 02:33:20,400
I promised to take care of brother, Mother.

1923
02:33:21,828 --> 02:33:23,108
Forgive me.

1924
02:33:26,032 --> 02:33:28,358
I couldn't keep my word.

1925
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:30,900
I couldn't keep my word.

1926
02:33:53,993 --> 02:33:56,316
From now on, without going anywhere...

1927
02:33:58,308 --> 02:34:00,441
Will you stand by my side?

1928
02:34:04,578 --> 02:34:06,650
Will you look after all these people?

1929
02:34:19,126 --> 02:34:20,941
If you think of it,it means you already asked.

1930
02:34:22,836 --> 02:34:24,150
You ask something,it is already done, Mother.

1931
02:34:59,191 --> 02:35:00,816
I am here, mother...

1932
02:35:01,262 --> 02:35:03,525
I am here for you.You are not alone.

1933
02:35:05,742 --> 02:35:08,025
Don't cry. I am here.

1934
02:35:08,259 --> 02:35:11,858
I am here for you.You are not alone.

1935
02:35:20,098 --> 02:35:22,275
I will be there,Don't be scared.

1936
02:35:25,434 --> 02:35:28,150
Don't worry, I'll take care.

1937
02:35:29,477 --> 02:35:31,727
On the 28th floor, Ms Suryakanthamis waiting for you, sir....

1938
02:35:31,807 --> 02:35:34,477
To offer an apology....In total remorse for turning the gun.

1939
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:35,810
Poor girl...

1940
02:35:38,518 --> 02:35:42,852
On the 24th floor, Ms Sukumari is repentingfor throwing away the gun, sir.

1941
02:35:47,268 --> 02:35:49,268
If you like Sukumari,apologize to Kantham first.

1942
02:35:49,352 --> 02:35:50,310
