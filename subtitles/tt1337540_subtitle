1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:05,468
SMALL VOICES

2
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:24,153
The Khmer Rouge caught him
and forced him to work.

3
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:27,921
He cut the grass to feed the cows.

4
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:32,795
At that Time he was just a small
boy, he didn't know what to do.

5
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:37,098
After the regime was over he was
recaptured again and was forced again

6
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,503
This time to be a soldier

7
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:46,978
and second grade was the last
he ever attended school in his life.

8
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,252
I lived in the countryside.
I didn't have... uh...

9
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:51,126
I left because I didn't have rice to eat.

10
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:56,066
Because rice field is death
if it doesn't rain.

11
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:03,301
Every day I don't have
enough food to eat.

12
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:10,178
The hardest thing is I'm poor
and have no house to live in.

13
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,876
Not enough food to eat.

14
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:23,159
My mom had 10 kids, 6 died, only 4 left.

15
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,160
My mother passed away,
my father has another wife.

16
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,325
This kid's my niece.

17
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,300
My family all died.

18
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,638
Her mom left her since she was small.

19
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,005
Yes, I take care of her
until she grows up.

20
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:44,542
I'm worried that I can't make
money for my mom.

21
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:49,145
That my family has no money
for hospital if they get sick.

22
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,551
I'm worried each time I go out,
people might catch me and sell me.

23
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:58,754
They catch us and take us to work
in a prostitute place.

24
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,866
Afraid that they take us to
sleep with them.

25
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,481
Sometimes I'm afraid to beg.
Foreigners scream at me.

26
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,579
They feel sorry and they give us money.

27
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,949
Sometimes if they don't give money
they would give something to eat.

28
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:07,665
Everyday, I fan tourists to make
money to buy rice to eat.

29
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,333
So I beg for money.

30
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,928
I beg people for money to go to school.

31
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,598
I never steal, I'm a beggar.

32
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,845
Sometimes I can't make money,
sometimes I can.

33
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,911
About $0.50, enough for school.

34
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:28,717
Teacher asks for money at school.
I don't have any.

35
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:32,884
Teacher asks for money for extra
class, I don't have any.

36
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,794
I fan people to get money to
buy rice to eat.

37
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:43,400
If I go to school I wouldn't have
money to buy rice.

38
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,495
I say, "Sir, I beg you for money."

39
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,670
Sometimes if I am lucky
I get $2.50, sometimes nothing.

40
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:55,240
But sometimes when people give us
money, police hit our hands.

41
00:06:55,581 --> 00:07:00,951
If I see police I hide somewhere
until he's gone then I can reappear.

42
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,078
I don't know where to hide.

43
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:09,058
When I get sick, I still beg as usual.

44
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:13,791
When I get sick I don't tell anyone.

45
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:18,565
Even if I tell, they're not going to care.

46
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:23,300
I hope and hope, but never
get what I hope for.

47
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:28,780
Because, I'm destined to be poor,
they're destined to be rich.

48
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,477
It's my destiny to be born poor.

49
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:42,488
If I can study, in the future I can
do anything, I won't have to beg.

50
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,627
I want someone to help me
go to school.

51
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,394
My name is Charam. I am 12.

52
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,381
I was born in Kampong
Cham Province.

53
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:15,123
Nowadays I live right at the
pagoda's fence.

54
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,770
My mom's name is Yorn.

55
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:34,446
When I was born,
a foreigner tried to buy me.

56
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:42,177
She offered my mom $500 and
a house to live in.

57
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:47,991
But my mom didn't sell me.

58
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:59,595
When I was begging in front of
people's houses

59
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:07,511
and at the museum,
my mom got pregnant

60
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:15,214
and a few months later my sister
Linna was born.

61
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:21,887
I helped wash bloody cloth from labor.

62
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:29,062
When I was young, my mom took
good care of me,

63
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:34,869
but as I grew older, she would
blame me for doing wrong.

64
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:40,379
If I was really bad she would
chase me and hit me.

65
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:46,476
If she caught me, she hit me
with a tree branch.

66
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:52,081
She hit me till I bled.

67
00:09:53,292 --> 00:10:01,961
If I didn't make money,
she would blame me and hit me.

68
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:08,437
Everyday, she does nothing
but stay at home.

69
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:18,379
My family was doing so bad,
we didn't have food to eat.

70
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:24,856
So I decided to beg people.

71
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,887
The first time I started to beg
I felt afraid.

72
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:34,626
It's hard to describe the feeling
but I knew I was scared.

73
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:42,732
After a while I felt good and then
it started to be alright.

74
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:52,707
We buy food and pay the debts
with the money.

75
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,440
What is your name?

76
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,978
My name is Charam.

77
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,274
How old are you?

78
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,905
Twelve.

79
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,141
What do you do everyday?

80
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,277
At present, I'm a beggar.

81
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,547
Where do you live?

82
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:16,820
Behind the pagoda.

83
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,115
Which pagoda?

84
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,452
Prolom Pagoda

85
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,258
What is your mother's name?

86
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,389
My mother's name is Yorn.

87
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,059
What is her job?

88
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,325
She doesn't work.

89
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,965
How about your little sister?

90
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,330
I carry my little sister to beg money.

91
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:37,271
Who makes money in your family?

92
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,238
Me and my sister.

93
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,337
Your little sister?

94
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,311
Yes.

95
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:48,013
So do you make enough money
to support the family?

96
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,381
Good enough.

97
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,016
Only for food, not for spending.

98
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:58,587
Are you happy at home or is
there a lot of fighting?

99
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:06,196
If I eat too slow, my mother
kicks my plate.

100
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:13,740
I swear at my mother and she hits me.

101
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:17,540
Do you like to live with a lot of
people or by yourself?

102
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,381
I like living in a group.

103
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,321
Why do you like to live with
a lot of people?

104
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:29,355
Because I have a lot of
kids to play with.

105
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:34,922
If I live alone I don't have anybody
to play with. That's boring.

106
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,265
What do you want to become
when you grow up?

107
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:45,103
Me, if I can read I can be whatever
I want except robbing or stealing.

108
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:48,943
I don't like those things.

109
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,345
Do you have a goal? What do you
want to be when you grow up?

110
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:56,045
Whatever, I don't decide yet.

111
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:59,221
What are you going to do
if you get to live here?

112
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,322
I'm happy, I want to live here.
I can live at any school.

113
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,886
As long as I get to learn.

114
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,227
Will you study hard?

115
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:13,565
Yes, if the adults don't hurt me
I want to study hard.

116
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:19,667
I've gone to school three times before

117
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:25,841
but I quit because the teachers
beat me too much.

118
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,021
Okay, you can wait outside.

119
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,557
Yes.

120
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,897
My name is Chet Leakhena.
I'm 13 years old.

121
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:34,741
My home town is Battambang Province.

122
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:40,651
It was hard living there, So poor.

123
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:47,318
Without money for food and study.

124
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:56,459
My mom is a farmer,
my father is a taxi driver.

125
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:04,532
After my father left, my mother would
hit us whenever we did wrong.

126
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:11,976
When my father left, I knew
he wasn't coming back.

127
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:16,751
So my mother could no longer
raise us and she left us

128
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,121
at the pagoda to live
with my grandmother.

129
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:25,596
Then she went away, somewhere
else, to get a new husband.

130
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:39,068
Long ago, when I still lived with my
family, I had 10 children.

131
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:44,645
Farmers like us, we don't have
our own rice fields,

132
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:49,016
so our lives depended on
people's help.

133
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:53,658
I realized I didn't have enlightenment

134
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:58,162
from my previous life.
That's why I was born so poor.

135
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:03,595
Then I had the bright idea of leaving
my family for religion, let them

136
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:08,106
support themselves.
So I left to live in the pagoda

137
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:11,199
when I was 46 years old.

138
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:16,541
One day my children left me
with my five grandchildren.

139
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,914
Their families were falling apart.

140
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:25,384
I asked the monks to let them stay
since they were already here.

141
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,948
I didn't ask them to come.

142
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:31,689
They came because they
had nothing to eat.

143
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,764
The monk said, "Yes if they're
drowning and we don't rescue them,"

144
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,893
"how can they survive, so let it be."

145
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:42,164
So they live with me since then,
needing everything.

146
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,607
But we had to keep going.

147
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,769
And that is the end, I may conclude.

148
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:56,112
Sometimes, my brothers fought and
cut each other with broken glass.

149
00:20:56,188 --> 00:21:01,182
They would try to drown and
choke each other.

150
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,697
They used to hit me too.

151
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:10,264
I thought if my family keeps
fighting like that,

152
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:13,566
what will our future become.

153
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:20,176
I worried about my future and
how I would be able to study.

154
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:24,942
Even if they hit me, I wasn't
mad because I thought -

155
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:29,545
we have one family and we
depend on each other.

156
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:34,758
If we don't love each other, who will?

157
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,733
When I lived here I
helped grandmother

158
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:19,828
prepare meals for the monks.

159
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:36,119
The people there respect
the monks like gods.

160
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:41,483
They bring food to the monks
for good karma because

161
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:48,432
they were born poor.
They try to do good to

162
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:56,373
be born rich in the next life.

163
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,577
Dish up the rice for your brother.

164
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:37,402
The kids in the pagoda, if they
don't learn to read and write

165
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:43,312
in the future they will wind up
on the streets sniffing glue.

166
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:49,678
I have a lot of close friends
at the pagoda.

167
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:56,626
I never had friends who had parents.

168
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:21,316
When I first started school I thought
that it could give me good future

169
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:25,618
and I will be able to make money
to support myself.

170
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:30,391
In the future... I want to become
a teacher.

171
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,278
Preparing to go.

172
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,784
Why don't you say goodbye first?

173
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,818
Leakhena, you have to say goodbye,
pay your respect to me.

174
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,250
Hear me Leakhena?

175
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:00,848
Yes.

176
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,490
Never forget people that do
favors for you.

177
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,727
Whatever their advice is, obey them.

178
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,669
Make it easy for them to train you.

179
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:20,606
And don't ever steal anything, that's
bad karma, if the thing is not given

180
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:25,378
to you by the person, don't take it.

181
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,407
Understand, Leakhena?

182
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,414
If you obey religious rules,
you can live long,

183
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,782
and in peace until the future comes.

184
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:39,389
See, you weren't born rich, you
were born a poor orphan

185
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:43,059
with no parents to support you.

186
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:44,091
Yes.

187
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,399
Because you didn't do good in
previous life, that's why

188
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,200
you were born with bad karma.

189
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:54,269
Understand? Remember my words.

190
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,964
Play with me.

191
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:19,966
Stop playing, I'm leaving right now.

192
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:26,769
Go, go.

193
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,909
Where is all her stuff?

194
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:37,546
I'm going too.

195
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,687
Don't forget.

196
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,644
Leakhena is gone.

197
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:39,344
My name is Mengly. I'm 15 years old,
and I'm from Kandal Province.

198
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:44,613
My parents live at the farm.
They grow corn.

199
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:51,393
When I was growing up, I thought
my life would be difficult.

200
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:56,423
Because I didn't study and
I couldn't read and write.

201
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:03,832
I'm the first son; it's my job to
take care of my brothers

202
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,741
and advise them to be good
and study hard.

203
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:13,712
I help with farm work, planting corn,
beans and other vegetables

204
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:18,284
I have to help my mother take care
around the house.

205
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:22,315
I help her cook and clean.

206
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:31,434
When my father's not around I
help care for my brothers.

207
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,501
I'm not good with words.

208
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:48,113
Well, farming is hard because
for crops to grow

209
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:54,955
we need fertilizers for good results.
It requires money all the time.

210
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,125
With the money I earn from farming
I spend some on fertilizers

211
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:07,900
and some for eating. If there isn't
enough we have to borrow

212
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:12,534
and then work to pay it off.

213
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:22,442
It's hard. Sometimes we can't
harvest the fields

214
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:28,618
because we don't have the equipment.

215
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:37,758
We need cattle to plow,
but we don't have those.

216
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:45,001
This year we could only
harvest a few corn plants.

217
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:50,412
We never get a lot.
We can't plow our fields

218
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:55,578
like everybody else with
better corn

219
00:30:55,653 --> 00:31:00,488
because we don't have cattle.
We plant on plain fields.

220
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:10,366
I also work for people harvesting beans
and corn when they are in season.

221
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:18,740
There is only that kind of work.
No stable job.

222
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:23,247
We have nothing, no hope of
buying anything.

223
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:28,341
So it's hard, because we
need money to buy cattle or land,

224
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:32,446
that's why we stay poor.

225
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:42,626
If my children are educated,
they will have skills to work.

226
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:50,766
I want them to get higher
education so they can

227
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:56,678
help their poor father.

228
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:02,983
We're pathetic, we're so poor.

229
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:08,220
Fishing is important to my family

230
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:12,992
because it gives us food
and we can sell it.

231
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:17,660
When I can't catch fish I feel
angry and sorry

232
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:21,603
for my parents because they have
nothing to cook with.

233
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,436
No fish to bring back home.

234
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,307
I don't know.

235
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:34,383
Let's fish somewhere else.

236
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:36,243
Over there.

237
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:52,569
When I see people in my village are
very poor I feel sorry for them,

238
00:32:53,338 --> 00:33:01,905
because they're not educated.
So they should let their kids go to

239
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,746
school, to find jobs.

240
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:14,619
My parents have told me that I should
study hard so that I can find a good job.

241
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:24,301
After I attend school, I think in the
future I will become a teacher

242
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:31,467
I worry about my brothers because
they can't read or write.

243
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:39,745
When I become a teacher, I will return
to my village to teach others to read.

244
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:46,753
It's very important because the
educated people can teach

245
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:53,559
the uneducated people,
to help the whole society.

246
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:53,208
My name is Layseng. I'm 13 years old.
I was born in Kandal.

247
00:35:53,284 --> 00:36:02,090
I lived with my parents and
my sisters and brothers.

248
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:10,197
We were so poor in the countryside.
My family made very little money.

249
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:17,432
My sister and I went to live at
Steung Mean Chey with my aunt.

250
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:23,447
When I got there, we had no
money for school,

251
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:29,578
so I started picking garbage.
While I was picking garbage,

252
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:33,715
Scott found me and took me here.

253
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:41,721
When I live in Steung Mean Chey,
my sister and I pick garbage all day.

254
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:47,829
From 5:00 AM to 11:00 AM, have
lunch and pick again until 5:00 PM.

255
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:53,707
We go home to eat and sleep next
morning we pick again.

256
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:59,978
Everyday is like that.

257
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,877
I was scared of the dump in nighttime.

258
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:07,013
Scared that my uncle might beat me,

259
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:10,183
scared of the dangers of
picking garbage at night.

260
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,296
Scared trucks might dump garbage on me.

261
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:19,931
When I picked garbage I felt
terrified that it might harm me,

262
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:24,737
But what can I do? If I don't go
I don't make money.

263
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,014
I lived with my aunt a long time. I had
an uncle who picked garbage

264
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:51,528
at night. We were scared
because he was killed.

265
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:56,498
He got ran over by a truck. It crushed
his skull, his brains leaked out.

266
00:38:56,567 --> 00:39:01,300
Ever since then we didn't pick
garbage at night again.

267
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:10,107
When I lived at the village,
people can't really make money.

268
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:14,481
There are lots of poor people,
even my parents.

269
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:18,511
When I was young and wasn't
able to help them

270
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:22,889
we didn't have enough to eat,
we were so poor.

271
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:30,925
My mom washes the bags everyday
with rain water mixed with garbage.

272
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:36,940
It produces very dirty water for
washing the bags.

273
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:47,009
When my parents are unhappy,
I am unhappy too.

274
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,707
My name is Seuon, my wife is Eng.

275
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:17,777
During Pol Pot time I was a small
child. I studied but couldn't keep up.

276
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:23,218
After the regime I lost my father.
There were 3 of us left.

277
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:26,916
I lived with my mother and big sister.

278
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:30,791
I never finished studying. I grew up
and helped make money.

279
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:34,661
Later I was caught and
forced to serve in the military.

280
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,399
After I left the force, I married my wife.

281
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:45,164
At the countryside, we tried to make
a living like everyone else.

282
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:49,042
It's hard over there.

283
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,742
Sometimes I can make money,
sometimes not.

284
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:58,949
It's so hard! And since I fell sick,
my wife couldn't make money there.

285
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:02,288
So we come here. My wife picks
garbage to support me.

286
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:08,422
No money to treat my disease, just
for foods only, no money for it.

287
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:12,662
It's more than 2 months since
I was diagnosed

288
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:16,536
but I haven't gotten treatment yet.

289
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:21,039
Scott took me to get diagnosed.
It's liver disease.

290
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:23,477
A tumor is growing on my liver.

291
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:29,882
I have nothing. I go to the dump to
get dishes to clean and use here.

292
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:32,923
Neighbors lend us stuff to carry
drinking water.

293
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,658
I lost everything.
I came here with nothing.

294
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,723
Everyday I don't make enough,
I can't buy him medicines

295
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:43,892
because I only make $0.50 to $0.75,
not even enough to eat.

296
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:48,564
It's not even enough for me to eat.

297
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:53,373
Sometimes I'm sick and
every night he screams with pain.

298
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:57,207
The neighbors told me to sell
everything I have to help him.

299
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,340
I don't have anything to sell.

300
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,646
I came from the countryside
with empty hands.

301
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:06,350
Now I'm trying to borrow more
money, I don't know if I will get it.

302
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:10,655
I will never make enough.

303
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:24,130
I saw human's leg, babies
and dead bodies with slit throats.

304
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:27,499
If I see babies, I bury them.
Someone's baby is like ours.

305
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:31,200
I bury them so the trucks
can't run them over.

306
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:36,679
It will be smashed up if the
truck runs it over, so I bury it.

307
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:42,141
The most difficult thing is
when I pick up garbage.

308
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,188
I used the searching metal stick.

309
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,883
To search for plastic, sack or
bag or aluminum.

310
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,858
I made it myself.

311
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:55,659
There's needles, glass pieces,
knives, metal sticks.

312
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,199
This is from a glass piece.

313
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,532
Two or three weeks,
and it hasn't healed yet.

314
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,901
Over here I make money, at the
countryside I couldn't make money.

315
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:13,107
Because my parents are poor, it's
hard, they don't have money or food,

316
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:18,849
So I make money for them to buy rice.
Only a little, I don't have a lot.

317
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:23,522
When I pick up garbage, what I am
afraid of the most are

318
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:27,792
the trucks because they are
very large and when

319
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:31,562
we pick up garbage it could hit us
if we don't pay attention.

320
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,067
If it hits me, it could injure
or even kill me.

321
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:37,569
It could scoop me up
together with trash

322
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:40,439
and dump me down on the trash.

323
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:45,773
I start to pick up garbage from
6:00AM in the morning.

324
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:50,081
I pick garbage at noon too, and in
the evening I pick more garbage.

325
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:55,922
I think it's destiny.
I was destined to be poor.

326
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:00,027
I want to go to school and
meet friends.

327
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,724
I read a little, but I can't write.

328
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:04,632
I want to be a teacher.

329
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,799
I eat one meal a day.

330
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:11,803
They sent me here to pick up garbage,
I made $0.15 or $0.25 a day.

331
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:16,739
I just newly learn to pick up. So after...

332
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:20,415
When I'm well trained, I can make
$0.50 to $0.75.

333
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:26,320
I've lived here 2 or 3 years already,
it was a long time until I knew

334
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,326
what kind of plastic to pick up.

335
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,494
I've lived here for so long.

336
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:38,691
I was 8 years old when I started
to pick up garbage.

337
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:43,963
My name is Hov Nhagn.
I'm 13 years old.

338
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:52,743
I live at Prek Chor Village in
Steung Mean Chey.

339
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:55,781
From my house to the
dump site is close.

340
00:45:55,986 --> 00:46:01,720
The garbage trucks are so noisy
that I can't sleep at night.

341
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:07,362
My mom's name is Pol Sokhoeun,
her job is sewing sacks.

342
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:11,490
My dad's name is Earm Korn,
his job is picking up garbage.

343
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:19,002
Me, I pick up garbage everyday until
evening, leaving this kid home alone.

344
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:25,749
If I stay home I wash dishes, clean up
the house and sew those sacks.

345
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:31,218
Never have free time. If I had free
time I would wash the clothes.

346
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:37,290
We make about $2.50 a day, me
and my husband.

347
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,761
A little more than $2.50.

348
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:49,303
Not enough for rent, electricity, water.
A jug of water is $0.60,

349
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,334
to rent this plot is $5.00 a month,

350
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,177
and food for twice a day.

351
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:00,540
Not enough, but we try hard
for our kids.

352
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:03,882
I want to prevent him from picking
garbage forever and

353
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,013
living a hard life like me.

354
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,187
And in the future he'll find happiness.

355
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:14,228
I don't want him to live like I do.

356
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:18,632
It was hard for me when I was young
so I don't want him to be like me.

357
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:24,172
That's why I try hard for them.
For their future.

358
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:30,109
I rather do hard work myself.
I don't want them to have futures like mine.

359
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:54,661
When my sister got to go to school
and I didn't and I couldn't read,

360
00:47:54,738 --> 00:48:00,404
I let her read for me. I feel sad
that I don't get to study

361
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:06,473
and know how good studying can be.

362
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:12,182
My sister has been in school for 2
years. I hope my time is now.

363
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:18,260
I do miss my family but staying
there was so poor.

364
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:31,701
At CCF I study Khmer, English,
computer, drawing, dancing and acting.

365
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:54,755
Of all my classes, I like computer
and English the most.

366
00:48:56,833 --> 00:49:03,329
Knees and toes, head shoulders
knees and toes knees and toes

367
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:06,205
Ears and eyes and mouth and nose

368
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:10,110
Head and shoulders knees and
toes knees and toes.

369
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:14,874
I'm very worried that I'm the
only one who gets to study

370
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:18,581
and my other siblings stay
at home and work everyday.

371
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:55,857
All finished.

372
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:47,085
If he only studies here and then
comes home, the police will catch us.

373
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:52,227
They come during the day or night.

374
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:56,504
So where does he sleep now?

375
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:04,273
Right now, he sleeps with me, but
the police are trying to catch us.

376
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:08,010
At night I hardly sleep. I watch the
road and tell my kids to run

377
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:11,679
if I see them coming. One time
they caught us and locked us up

378
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:15,213
for a day and night. They watch us
go to the bathroom,

379
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:19,092
and they even beat him with a
wooden baton this long.

380
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:20,453
Beat him.

381
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,339
Okay, thank you for bringing Charam.

382
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:49,578
I want to study. I'm happy
that I can study here.

383
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:54,355
I see people typing on computers,
I see toys, I want to play.

384
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:58,483
In my mind I want to study... and...

385
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,597
And have fun with friends.

386
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,292
Charam.

387
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,033
Charam.

388
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:09,983
This morning my sister woke me up.
I'm so happy I am accepted here.

389
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:16,617
As soon as I woke up, I got dressed
and waited for the Taxi to bring me.

390
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:22,164
I see kids studying -
I'm happy I get to study here.

391
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:31,468
The first time I attend class, I'm not
so good. I just follow along.

392
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:38,913
But after three days I know ABC's
and I can read a little bit.

393
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:49,148
From now on I will study hard.
I won't fight or steal or swear.

394
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:57,463
I will study hard and be kind to
everyone. I'll get educated.

395
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:05,942
And when I grow up I can get a job
and make money for my mom.

396
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:37,825
I wouldn't say that our living has
improved much, but

397
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:42,297
we're not starving either.
Our children go to school.

398
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:47,098
That's why I try hard myself to
make a little more money,

399
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:51,664
as long as my children get to study.

400
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:56,942
I want to see him happy, I want him
to be educated like others and

401
01:01:57,013 --> 01:02:01,245
not so ignorant like I am.
I want my kids to be educated.

402
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:07,756
While I was picking up garbage
I used to think that

403
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:12,420
if I could get to study I would
make my parents happy.

404
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:20,832
I want to study and do well in class.
I will find a job, and my parents

405
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:26,466
will have some money and the
poverty will be ended.

406
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:31,974
I feel excited when I go to school.
I have never felt that before,

407
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:34,380
now I get to have it.

408
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:44,815
When I leave CCF to visit my
parents, I'm happy to see them.

409
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:52,562
But I'm also very happy to get
back to CCF and study more.

410
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:59,905
It's difficult to study when I go back home.

411
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:07,405
I could make money, but it
was dangerous.

412
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:14,787
At school there's no danger and
we can have a future here.

413
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:20,088
When I grow up I want to
become a teacher.

414
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:27,327
I want to become a good teacher,
for kids who don't do well in class.

415
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:33,399
I would explain to them and
help them understand.

416
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:39,540
I would help them to read like me.

417
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:16,710
But I'm afraid. I'm afraid that
if I go back to pick garbage.

418
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:21,120
I will live in misery again.

419
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:30,423
Those kids at the dump, they don't
have anyone to take them to school.

420
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:38,429
Some don't want to study,

421
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:47,575
but others want to and have
no one to help them.

422
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:12,506
Everyday I'm sick most of the time.

423
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:16,367
Sometimes I feel well for an hour or
two and then I get sick again.

424
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:20,574
I'm on IV but I take it off to
go to work and when

425
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:23,778
I come back, I put it back on.
That's because we're poor.

426
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:30,214
I'm not that well either,
but it's nothing specific.

427
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:35,629
I don't have a disease -
we just don't get enough to eat.

428
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:41,159
You can see our house - we're poor
and have a lot of children.

429
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:46,732
What little we make we
feed our children with.

430
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:52,213
If the country had a good leader
then our living would be better.

431
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:58,513
In my generation we didn't get to
study at all.

432
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:02,785
Now there are better schools for kids,
but it's not enough yet because

433
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:06,817
there are too many poor people.

434
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,191
I feel so happy, so excited when I see
my kids get their good education.

435
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:14,794
I feel happy every time I see them
and they know a lot.

436
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:18,704
The other day she told me
she is No.1 in class

437
01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:22,540
I was so happy I was jumping up
and down.

438
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,773
We can help them to get their
education and then

439
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:28,180
later on they can support themselves.

440
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:32,317
Of course it's hard but we have to
struggle on, since our children

441
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:36,620
are in school. If we keep them here
with us, they won't be able to study.

442
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:38,817
I don't think it's destiny.

443
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:44,326
When I grow up I want to help poor
people to go to school.

444
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:48,035
Let them study hard.

445
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:54,069
Kids are poor because their parents
didn't get to study,

446
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:58,204
and they didn't let their children
go to school.

447
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:02,112
When I grow up I want to be a very
good mother.

448
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:07,782
I want to teach my children to
study hard, to love each other

449
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:13,022
between brother and sister
to not fight with each other.

450
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,994
I don't feel like I'm scared
at all anymore.

451
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:21,567
I don't feel like I'm scared because
I have already learned a lot,

452
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:26,131
I have a good education and for that
I can have a good job.

453
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:32,909
When I grow up, if I have a chance
to work in the government,

454
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:35,750
I want to do that kind of work.

455
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,780
Because governmental work is
good work.

456
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,553
The reason why Cambodia
is poor is because

457
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:46,959
there are not enough educated people.

458
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:54,126
When I grow up I want to become
a translator because that job

459
01:07:54,203 --> 01:08:00,142
is good for us, I can get good salary
and I can get to know a lot of people

460
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:04,543
in the society and help them.

461
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:09,412
My name is Layseng,
I am 13 years old.

462
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:13,683
I want to be an English translator
when I grow up.

463
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:53,823
I have four brothers and one sister

464
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:57,497
I think it is hard to live when
everyone is either rich or poor.

465
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:01,462
We're poor because of bad
karma from previous lives.

466
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:09,736
We can change that bad karma by
doing good things - don't steal,

467
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:16,342
don't drink alcohol or kill,
and study hard.

468
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:25,751
When I am educated and grown up
I will help teach kids who don't

469
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:33,860
get to study, I will help
everyone read and write.

470
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:41,272
When I went home to visit and
saw the kids in the pagoda,

471
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:47,942
I want them to study like me so
they can have jobs in the future.

472
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:55,219
They get to live in the pagoda
but they don't get to study.

473
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:32,458
Since I moved from home to CCF,
I have changed a lot.

474
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:43,333
The most important thing is my
future and the future of my family.

475
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:49,036
In the future I want to become
a very good father to my children.

476
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:55,910
I will teach my children and
let them go to school

477
01:10:55,985 --> 01:11:00,752
so they will learn and have
knowledge about traditions,

478
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:03,792
and know about morality.

479
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:16,329
But I'm worried about when I grow
up and have to find a job of my own.

480
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:45,324
It's been so many months!
Since Charam left for school,

481
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:47,801
I don't have money to spend at all.

482
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:50,870
When Charam was here,
he would make money.

483
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:54,340
Foreigners liked and pitied him,
and gave him money.

484
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:59,937
Now that he left, I don't have enough.

485
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:03,542
Wherever I go, I have to take
Linna with me.

486
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:09,717
Sometimes she gets hurt
while I work. I can't look after her.

487
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:13,189
Back then I still had my son to
help me make money.

488
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:16,288
Now I don't have him.
I live off other people.

489
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:19,391
I eat with tears all the time.

490
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:23,369
Someone will steal my daughter
if I leave her alone.

491
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:26,203
That's why I have to always
take her with me.

492
01:12:26,575 --> 01:12:29,203
I think about what
my children's future will be like

493
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:32,475
because I have no money
to help them.

494
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:38,085
So I let him go to school,
no matter how hard it is for me.

495
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:41,520
I still have this little girl left.

496
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:46,426
That's why I have no ability to
raise this new baby.

497
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:50,328
If I had money, I would have had
an abortion already.

498
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:54,597
It's too late now. I don't know
what to do.

499
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:09,640
What I was afraid of the most was
I would grow up and still be poor.

500
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:14,746
Then I got to come to school here.
I'd rather my mom struggles now.

501
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:19,817
And when I grow up, I can get
a job and support her.

502
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:28,297
When I used to beg I thought,
I have to study.

503
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:33,569
If I don't, I will stay poor and
won't have a future.

504
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:39,012
Without education, I might turn
out to be a gangster.

505
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:43,745
Now I get to study as I always wanted.

506
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:51,724
I take photography class for 30
minutes each day.

507
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:57,664
I want to become a
professional photographer.

508
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:01,432
Go to the riverfront or not?

509
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:02,731
Yes.

510
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,408
Are you happy when I
come visit like this?

511
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:09,704
Yes I am.

512
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:15,015
I want my sister to come live
here too, but she's still too small.

513
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:19,713
If she's 6 years old I can ask
Scott to let her come live here,

514
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:24,157
But she's too small so she can't.

515
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:27,794
Who adopted you?

516
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:29,056
No, I live in an organization

517
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,692
Cambodian Children's
Fund organization.

518
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:37,371
I haven't seen you in a while.

519
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:39,897
Yes, because I haven't come
for a while.

520
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:54,215
Let's go to the front of the palace.

521
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:57,520
Your legs are tired yet?

522
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,228
Your legs are tired yet?
Is that why you just fart?

523
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:03,457
Your fart stinks.

524
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:34,354
I want to study and have education

525
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:38,024
so that I can work like others
when I grow up.

526
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:45,231
I'm worried that in the future,
I'll still be poor.

527
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:11,031
I just want to work regular job
to support my life.

528
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:29,445
I want to work to feed my mother,
my siblings, myself, the whole family.

529
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:12,123
I want to have enough - enough to
wear, enough to eat, nothing else.

530
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:43,093
When I first arrived at CCF, I felt like
I was born again.

531
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:51,840
Before I was like a flower that
nobody cared to water,

532
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:58,216
never saw the sun and nobody
cared or paid any attention.

533
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:04,053
But now this same flower is taken to a
place where it is cared for and watered.

534
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:08,858
It can feel the breeze and see the sun.
