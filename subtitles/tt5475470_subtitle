1
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,399
What the hell?

2
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,479
Holdup at the gate.

3
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,540
Looks like we got a welcoming committee.

4
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,779
Hey! This is private property.

5
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,359
Clear the entrance!

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,819
You can't come in and
take what you want anymore!

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,689
Chile is our country,
and this is our gold!

8
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,189
Come on, let's go.

9
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,649
Pablo, back in the truck!

10
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,819
Okay, we're going in.

11
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,569
Can't, because we are
totally ready to go.

12
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,939
Alison's even got her coat on.

13
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,149
But I'll tell you what,
one last thing though.

14
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,439
You know those, um...

15
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,439
oh, gosh, those blueberry-lemon muffins

16
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,069
at Angelina's that I love?

17
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,652
- Do you want a muffin?
- No.

18
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:43,649
All right, just two.
You know what? Get four.

19
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,330
And then whatever you
want, okay? Of course.

20
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,109
You have to ask, not me.

21
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,982
- I will.
- Yes, I did see that.

22
00:01:51,983 --> 00:01:54,710
So, the protests are
in Santiago now, too?

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,439
Okay, I'll come in.

24
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,779
But let's make it really
quick, okay? Thanks, Blake.

25
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,279
Okay, who is excited for

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,649
some college tour action?

27
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,069
Um, maybe you should hang back.

28
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,519
Stevie said she could take me.

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,649
What?

30
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,569
I actually wouldn't mind

31
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,020
a break from studying.

32
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:15,439
And it does sound like
you have your hands full.

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,069
What, that?

34
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,899
That's, uh...

35
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,580
it's a little kerfuffle
at a gold mine in Chile.

36
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,880
Just ten minutes at the
office, that's it. Okay?

37
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,979
It's just...

38
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,519
college is supposed to be my thing,

39
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,609
and if we show up in a motorcade
with diplomatic security

40
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,569
and you and Blake
constantly on the phone...

41
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,649
I know, total bummer.

42
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,609
Which is why I got us down to two cars,

43
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,399
and I asked Blake
specifically to tell the school

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,439
not to make a fuss about anything.

45
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,439
Because I get it, Ali,
you want to be normal,

46
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,479
but that goes for me, too, you know.

47
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,979
And this is a really big deal,

48
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,689
and I don't want to miss out on it,

49
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,790
and I really want to come.

50
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,899
Okay. Let's go.

51
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,900
Okay!

52
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:06,859
Okay, okay. And you know what?

53
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,609
I'll tell you what.

54
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,859
Stevie'll come, too.

55
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,149
It'll be...

56
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,859
Look at that, you already packed a bag.

57
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,460
Yeah, you know, just in case.

58
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,130
So what do we have on this girl?

59
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:21,880
We confirmed the
marriage to Jibral Disah

60
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:23,880
took place in January,
possibly December.

61
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:25,460
Oh, well, that's definitive.

62
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:28,090
You couldn't find a more recent photo?

63
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:29,760
It's a school I.D. photo from 2011.

64
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:31,590
Records are spotty after
the fall of Gaddafi.

65
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:33,630
There's almost nothing online.

66
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:35,840
Yeah, ISR drone's been on
the Al Wahat District 24/7,

67
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,170
but it's pretty hard to
get facial recognition

68
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:39,710
when she's only ever out in a niqab.

69
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:41,554
You said this Hijriyyah
business was the key

70
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,223
to getting Disah before he attacks us

71
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,143
with another dirty bomb.

72
00:03:45,144 --> 00:03:46,933
I'm not hearing any doors opening.

73
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:48,143
It's gonna take time.

74
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,103
Patience and pattern analysis,

75
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,763
building more covert
assets on the ground.

76
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:56,103
This can't be another ten-year
quilting circle like bin Laden.

77
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:57,513
Hizb al-Shahid is ready

78
00:03:57,514 --> 00:03:59,223
to attack us again. They got plenty

79
00:03:59,224 --> 00:04:01,183
of leftover uranium, they're
recruiting our own citizens.

80
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:03,553
We need to find that girl

81
00:04:03,554 --> 00:04:05,053
so we can take them down. Now.

82
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:06,643
We can move faster,

83
00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:07,933
but that means taking bigger risks.

84
00:04:07,934 --> 00:04:10,053
Losing Mimi was a pretty big risk.

85
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:11,244
Not my call.

86
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:14,813
I'm talking about who
to reach out to next.

87
00:04:14,814 --> 00:04:16,933
Disah has dozens of
powerful enemies in Libya,

88
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:19,183
most of them militia
leaders vying for power.

89
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:20,263
They want to take Disah down.

90
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:21,853
That's a motivation we can exploit.

91
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:23,763
We already got burned by someone
we thought we could trust.

92
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,473
These guys, we know we can't trust.

93
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:26,683
You want to get the lowest,

94
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,103
you have to work with the lowest.

95
00:04:28,104 --> 00:04:30,143
It's risky, but I've
seen it yield good Intel.

96
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,103
I have to agree with Henry on this.

97
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:33,973
We might be able to exploit
a common interest now,

98
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,103
but how many times has covert
ops handed a gun to extremists

99
00:04:36,104 --> 00:04:37,433
only to have it turned on us later?

100
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:38,763
Sounds like we don't
have much of a choice.

101
00:04:38,764 --> 00:04:42,183
Well, w... there might be another way.

102
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:46,263
This photograph was taken at
Al-Taria Academy in Tripoli.

103
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:47,893
I checked into the faculty.

104
00:04:47,894 --> 00:04:51,013
There's a teacher living
in Delaware under a visa.

105
00:04:51,014 --> 00:04:53,103
She taught there at the same time.

106
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:55,103
Was she Hijriyyah's teacher?

107
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:57,103
That I don't know, but
it's worth looking into.

108
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:58,313
High risk of exposure

109
00:04:58,314 --> 00:04:59,973
if this woman has any
loyalties back home.

110
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:01,313
Well, we might be able
to use the visa status,

111
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:02,393
get some leverage.

112
00:05:02,394 --> 00:05:04,013
And risk losing our only advantage?

113
00:05:04,014 --> 00:05:05,053
Which is that, so far,

114
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,813
no one knows we're
looking for this girl.

115
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:08,263
All it takes is one word

116
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:09,893
to make her flee our area of interest,

117
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:11,183
and we're screwed.

118
00:05:11,184 --> 00:05:13,183
And talking to warlords is

119
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:14,353
not risking exposure?

120
00:05:14,354 --> 00:05:17,103
All right. Henry, go talk
to this teacher with Jane.

121
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:18,263
Jose,

122
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:21,683
reach out to CIA, see
what assets you can find.

123
00:05:21,684 --> 00:05:26,183
If all we got are two bad
ideas, let's see which one works.

124
00:05:26,184 --> 00:05:27,266
- Good morning.
- Morning.

125
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:28,643
Here's a copy of today's agenda.

126
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:29,933
Thank you. And did you get the...

127
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:32,053
Four lemon-blueberry and a vegan scone,

128
00:05:32,054 --> 00:05:33,393
in case Stevie joined us.

129
00:05:33,394 --> 00:05:34,513
That's just eerie.

130
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:35,683
Mm. Thank you.

131
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:37,723
Uh, also, I took the
liberty of highlighting

132
00:05:37,724 --> 00:05:40,013
various students' online reviews

133
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:42,013
of professors at Rafferty College.

134
00:05:42,014 --> 00:05:45,183
The debate professor is
wonderfully polarizing.

135
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:47,143
Mom, I don't think you pay Blake enough.

136
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:48,393
Oh, I am sure I don't.

137
00:05:48,394 --> 00:05:51,053
Okay.

138
00:05:51,054 --> 00:05:54,223
Not that I don't love seeing your faces,

139
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:57,603
but explain to me again
why I had to be here

140
00:05:57,604 --> 00:06:00,553
to discuss protests at
a gold mine in Chile.

141
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:03,103
The demonstrations are
growing at the mine,

142
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:05,143
as well as in Santiago.

143
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:09,143
Well, it's not surprising
people might object

144
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:11,223
to moving an entire
glacier to dig the gold out.

145
00:06:11,224 --> 00:06:13,433
It's not so much the glacier

146
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:15,313
as the strong whiff of neocolonialism

147
00:06:15,314 --> 00:06:17,013
in a U.S. company coming in to cart off

148
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:20,013
most of a Latin American
country's gold to el norte.

149
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:22,103
Wait. This company, Hercutel,

150
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:23,893
bought the rights from
the Chilean government...

151
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:25,266
- Yes.
- ...fair and square?

152
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:28,053
Yes, the terms of which
were fully agreed upon

153
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,473
with Chile's Minister of Mining.

154
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:30,683
But now, President Contreras

155
00:06:30,684 --> 00:06:33,433
has found that she's
had a change of heart.

156
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,053
It's her incendiary
statements to the press,

157
00:06:36,054 --> 00:06:37,513
accusing Hercutel of negotiating

158
00:06:37,514 --> 00:06:39,393
far more than their
fair share of profit,

159
00:06:39,394 --> 00:06:40,473
that sparked the protest.

160
00:06:40,474 --> 00:06:42,103
Of course, what she doesn't mention

161
00:06:42,104 --> 00:06:44,513
is that the Hercutel deal
follows the same terms

162
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:46,643
as every other mining
contract in the region.

163
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:50,223
So she's spinning the
truth to try to look tough.

164
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:53,836
Still not sure how State figures here.

165
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:55,716
Yesterday, one of Hercutel's employees,

166
00:06:55,717 --> 00:06:57,440
an American, was injured

167
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,440
when a protester hit him with a rock.

168
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:00,954
Hercutel wants assurance

169
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:02,502
of its employees' safety.

170
00:07:02,503 --> 00:07:05,460
And the White House has made it clear

171
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:07,581
that this is a priority.

172
00:07:07,582 --> 00:07:09,501
Ah. Well.

173
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:12,331
Now I understand why I'm here.

174
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:14,331
Okay.

175
00:07:14,332 --> 00:07:16,161
Um, Matt...

176
00:07:16,162 --> 00:07:17,794
- Hmm?
- ...draft a statement

177
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:19,201
to Foreign Minister Torres

178
00:07:19,202 --> 00:07:21,241
reminding him of his
country's responsibility

179
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:23,241
to protect our workers.

180
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,951
Emphasize the impact on Chile's economy

181
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:28,241
should they jeopardize their
trade agreement with us.

182
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:31,581
So threaten to break up with
them if they cheat on us.

183
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:34,201
Or at least stop hitting us with rocks.

184
00:07:34,202 --> 00:07:35,911
Okay. I am off

185
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:37,701
to try and figure out how in the world

186
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:39,831
I'm going to pay for three
liberal arts educations

187
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:41,041
before I retire.

188
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:42,581
French horn.

189
00:07:42,582 --> 00:07:44,201
Huh?

190
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:46,581
It's a guaranteed scholarship.

191
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:48,331
Oh.

192
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:52,201
Well, somehow I don't see
Alison jumping on that.

193
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:55,892
But Jason could be in for a
surprising birthday present.

194
00:07:57,872 --> 00:07:59,331
All right.

195
00:07:59,332 --> 00:08:01,951
First up is the campus tour,

196
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:06,001
featuring the bell
tower completed in 1857.

197
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:08,041
Mom, have you seen this blog
about Chilean protesters?

198
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:09,501
I'm reading it.

199
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:11,371
And we're in a regular
tour group, right?

200
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:12,951
No photo op with the dean or anything?

201
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:14,911
I was personally assured
by the dean's assistant

202
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,331
of total anonymity.

203
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:19,121
Donna. Big Sondheim fan.

204
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:21,331
Okay, will you tell Daisy
the statement's good to go?

205
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:23,584
- We need to get on top of this with the press.
- Yep.

206
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:24,791
We're here, guys!

207
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,451
Everybody ready?

208
00:08:26,452 --> 00:08:27,871
All right.

209
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:30,371
Good-bye, Madam Secretary;

210
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:32,722
hello, just another college mom.

211
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,241
Blake...

212
00:08:44,242 --> 00:08:45,581
I don't understand.

213
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:47,722
We bonded over Sweeney Todd.

214
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:55,331
Dean Pistilli?

215
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:56,332
Blake Moran, hi.

216
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,352
Is Donna here?

217
00:08:57,353 --> 00:08:58,371
Hi. Hi.

218
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,664
- Madam Secretary, it's such an honor.
- Oh.

219
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,331
Welcome to Rafferty College.

220
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:04,581
This is overwhelming.

221
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:06,871
You... shouldn't have.

222
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:08,291
It's really the least we could do.

223
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:10,291
These are my daughters,
Stevie and Alison.

224
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,244
- Hi. It's so nice to meet you.
- Fantastic.

225
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:13,874
- Alison is the reason...
- Group photo, please,

226
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,201
for the, uh, Rafferty Report!

227
00:09:15,202 --> 00:09:16,432
Bring that banner around.

228
00:09:17,332 --> 00:09:18,332
Okay? Good.

229
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,302
Okay.

230
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:27,604
Uh, and to your right,
you will see a display

231
00:09:27,605 --> 00:09:29,893
of what we here at Rafferty

232
00:09:29,894 --> 00:09:33,013
nobly refer to as the Wasting of Time.

233
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:35,553
Wow. That's an important
part of the curriculum,

234
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:36,619
if I recall.

235
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:40,353
You're killing it with
the college crowd, ma'am.

236
00:09:40,354 --> 00:09:43,429
And lest you think we have too much fun,

237
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,344
up ahead is the Science
and Technology Center.

238
00:09:46,345 --> 00:09:48,344
Isn't that where the Fashion
and Design department is?

239
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:49,534
Uh, yeah, temporarily,

240
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:51,344
until they're finished
with their new building.

241
00:09:51,345 --> 00:09:52,405
Are you F&D?

242
00:09:52,406 --> 00:09:53,464
Hoping.

243
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:55,134
I should've guessed from the cool boots.

244
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:56,077
Well, hey,

245
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:57,194
is there any chance that we could

246
00:09:57,195 --> 00:09:58,409
check out some of the classrooms?

247
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,680
Oh, I'm pretty sure you get to go

248
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:01,134
wherever you want to, Madam Secretary.

249
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:03,384
See? Upside.

250
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:04,424
Secretary McCord?

251
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:05,794
Excuse me, Secretary...

252
00:10:05,795 --> 00:10:07,594
I'm just trying to talk to
my government representative.

253
00:10:07,595 --> 00:10:09,594
Are you infringing on my rights?

254
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:11,794
Hey, it's okay, it's...
How can I help you guys?

255
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:14,174
What are you doing to
stop the rapacious plunder

256
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:15,344
of Chile's natural resources

257
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:17,344
by the U.S. corporation Hercutel?

258
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:18,634
I am aware of the situation.

259
00:10:18,635 --> 00:10:21,134
You're "aware," which means
you intend to do nothing.

260
00:10:21,135 --> 00:10:22,924
And meanwhile, Hercutel is destroying

261
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:24,788
one of the few glaciers
we have left, literally

262
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:26,717
- moving mountains to steal gold.
- If I can...

263
00:10:26,718 --> 00:10:28,424
How does it feel to be the puppet

264
00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:30,294
of an imperialist
government, Secretary Cortez?

265
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:31,714
Hey, guys, you know what?

266
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,254
Thank you, but we're
gonna continue on our tour.

267
00:10:33,255 --> 00:10:34,255
Hang on a second.

268
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:36,794
If the situation were as black and white

269
00:10:36,795 --> 00:10:39,134
as some of the coverage
online, I would be

270
00:10:39,135 --> 00:10:41,195
as outraged as all of you.

271
00:10:42,505 --> 00:10:45,344
Can you not violate my
personal space, please?

272
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,964
You haven't answered my question.

273
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:49,634
Do you or do you not plan to respond

274
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:51,754
to the demands of the Chilean people?

275
00:10:51,755 --> 00:10:53,634
Mom. Forget it.

276
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:55,294
They're not listening.

277
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:58,384
I always listen to the voice of protest.

278
00:10:58,385 --> 00:11:03,504
But protest can sometimes,
necessarily, simplify things.

279
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:05,924
The truth is, an agreement was made

280
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:09,344
between an American corporation
and the Chilean government,

281
00:11:09,345 --> 00:11:13,054
a deal that both sides agreed upon.

282
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:16,214
Our government, in particular
the Department of State,

283
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:18,464
does not have the power to interfere

284
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:20,004
on a legitimate contract, even if...

285
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:21,214
Viva Allende!

286
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:24,094
Down! Down on the ground! Now!

287
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:26,504
Yeah!

288
00:11:26,505 --> 00:11:27,714
It's just confetti, man.

289
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:29,815
So much for normal.

290
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:37,767
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com.</b>

291
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:45,807
Well, you can't say
that Rafferty students

292
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:48,101
aren't politically engaged. Hang on.

293
00:11:48,102 --> 00:11:50,261
Well, I-I could do with
a little less engagement.

294
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:51,682
- Ugh.
- You okay?

295
00:11:51,683 --> 00:11:52,682
Yeah. That's the one.

296
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:54,431
Got it. Good. Hey.

297
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:57,431
Who is up for a little room service?

298
00:11:57,432 --> 00:11:59,181
Not hungry.

299
00:11:59,182 --> 00:12:01,431
Hey. Come on.

300
00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:03,561
I know. It's not about me.

301
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:06,391
Are you kidding? It's all about you.

302
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,601
You're the reason why we're here.

303
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,973
Come on. Let's go to that...

304
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:11,735
Wh-What's that thing
they're having tonight?

305
00:12:11,736 --> 00:12:14,255
It's something called the
Husky Dining Hall Experience,

306
00:12:14,256 --> 00:12:16,347
followed by a comedy improv show.

307
00:12:16,348 --> 00:12:17,647
You know we can't leave this room

308
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:19,727
without causing an incident.
Can't we just go home?

309
00:12:19,728 --> 00:12:20,741
Listen to me.

310
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:24,121
If I have learned anything, it
is how fast the news cycle is.

311
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:26,541
This whole thing is probably
gonna be blown over by tomorrow.

312
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:28,847
Just in time for the
breakfast presentation

313
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,846
on the admissions process,

314
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,426
followed by an overview
of clubs and activities.

315
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:35,426
You memorized the schedule?

316
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:37,874
I don't think it's gonna
blow over by tomorrow.

317
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,323
What are you doing to
stop the rapacious plunder

318
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:42,132
of Chile's natural resources by
the U.S. corporation Hercutel?

319
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:44,073
Protest can simplify things.

320
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:45,703
Which means you intend to do nothing.

321
00:12:45,704 --> 00:12:48,152
Our government has no power...

322
00:12:48,153 --> 00:12:50,282
That's completely not what I said. I...

323
00:12:50,283 --> 00:12:52,717
Except it's the Internet, so now it is.

324
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:55,362
Ma'am.

325
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:56,862
Literally moving
mountains to steal gold.

326
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,323
- And the Chilean government...
- How does it feel...

327
00:12:58,324 --> 00:12:59,702
Listen, before you say anything...

328
00:12:59,703 --> 00:13:01,412
You couldn't tell those infants

329
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,152
that the State Department
has no authority over

330
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:05,202
a private business deal?

331
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:07,242
That is exactly what I told them!

332
00:13:07,243 --> 00:13:08,412
They edited that part out!

333
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:11,242
Then you need to find
a way to put it back in!

334
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:12,952
Thanks to your circus act,

335
00:13:12,953 --> 00:13:15,362
not only are more idiot
protests springing up

336
00:13:15,363 --> 00:13:19,362
on college campuses, but now
the Chileans are putting a stay

337
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:21,612
on Hercutel's mining operation.

338
00:13:21,613 --> 00:13:24,202
Chile is shutting down Hercutel

339
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,032
because some college kids yelled at me?

340
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:29,452
No, because you failed
to put this thing to bed,

341
00:13:29,453 --> 00:13:30,553
like I asked!

342
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:36,362
Russell, it has been
a very long morning,

343
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:39,242
so I'm just gonna ask.

344
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:42,822
We've got Hizb al-Shahid
running around with dirty bombs.

345
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:46,822
Why is it that one mine
shutting down in the Andes

346
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:48,822
is a problem for the administration?

347
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:51,822
Every screwup is a problem
for this administration!

348
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:56,702
: Look, Hercutel is
headquartered in Oregon,

349
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,532
home state of Dalton's
congressional ally,

350
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,112
Senator Westrick.

351
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:02,112
The deal Hercutel made with the Chileans

352
00:14:02,113 --> 00:14:03,952
is upward of two billion in revenue.

353
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:06,612
So...

354
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:09,612
we keep Hercutel happy,

355
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:12,032
then Dalton keeps
Westrick in his corner.

356
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:13,072
Which we need.

357
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:15,652
So get that mine back up and running,

358
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:18,347
and then get those
diaper-wearing toddlers

359
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:19,782
on campus to love you.

360
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:23,612
What, apologize for
being misrepresented?

361
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,362
Win them back with your witty tweets.

362
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:27,362
Or do a duet with Colbert.

363
00:14:27,363 --> 00:14:29,362
I don't care what you do.

364
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:31,532
But the youth vote counts.

365
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:34,633
And you just piled it
up and lit it on fire.

366
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,071
Minister Torres, I'll make this brief.

367
00:14:40,072 --> 00:14:43,491
We need Hercutel to resume its
mining operation immediately.

368
00:14:43,492 --> 00:14:46,491
It's only a temporary
suspension, Madam Secretary,

369
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:49,471
to restore order in a
time of civil unrest.

370
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,861
I'm sure you can understand.

371
00:14:50,862 --> 00:14:52,241
That, I understand.

372
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:54,071
But what I don't understand is

373
00:14:54,072 --> 00:14:56,651
why Chile isn't honoring
the mineral rights agreement

374
00:14:56,652 --> 00:14:59,241
you already agreed to with Hercutel.

375
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:02,651
Right now, President Contreras's
greater concern must be

376
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,071
the safety and well-being
of the Chilean people.

377
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:08,151
And my concern is for
the safety and well-being

378
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:09,321
of our U.S. citizens,

379
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,941
who are getting hit
in the head with rocks

380
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:14,941
because your president is out
there whipping up protesters

381
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:17,361
to try to look tough
on... and I quote...

382
00:15:17,362 --> 00:15:18,741
"the plunders of the north."

383
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:22,151
Now, believe me,

384
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:24,901
I understand your president
has an election to win.

385
00:15:24,902 --> 00:15:27,321
If you're implying
that President Contreras

386
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:30,361
is willing to sacrifice
Chile's business relationships

387
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,361
for the sake of her poll numbers...

388
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:34,531
The U.S. Commerce Department
and State Department

389
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:37,441
annually assess the
global investment climate.

390
00:15:37,442 --> 00:15:41,691
If Chile reneges on its
contract with Hercutel

391
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:44,691
and continues to suspend its operations,

392
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:46,651
that could sink your assessment,

393
00:15:46,652 --> 00:15:50,981
basically ending foreign
investment in your economy.

394
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:53,741
And that definitely
won't win any elections.

395
00:15:53,742 --> 00:15:58,441
I will pass your concerns
on to President Contreras.

396
00:15:58,442 --> 00:16:00,542
I look forward to her response.

397
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:08,824
- Ayyad.
- Yes.

398
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:10,571
Immigration's here to see you.

399
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:12,281
Uh, you can take your break early.

400
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:14,212
Okay. Uh, thank you.

401
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:16,744
- Laila Ayyad?
- Yes.

402
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:19,241
Hello. I'm with U.S.
Customs and Immigration.

403
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:21,361
I just need to ask you a few questions.

404
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:22,402
Is there a problem?

405
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:23,441
Not at all.

406
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:25,651
It's part of the new security measures.

407
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,342
Do you mind?

408
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,981
If she thinks she's being
investigated, she'll shut down.

409
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:34,982
Yeah.

410
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:37,441
Hey, keep it friendly, okay?

411
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:39,031
Uh, let's move into work history.

412
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41,031
How long did you teach
Islamic literature

413
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:43,031
at Al-Taria Academy in Tripoli?

414
00:16:43,032 --> 00:16:44,441
Three years.

415
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:46,321
Seven years before that in Misurata.

416
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:49,981
Uh, I put all this
down on my application.

417
00:16:49,982 --> 00:16:53,151
Ask her if she still
has family in Libya.

418
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:56,151
And do you still have family there?

419
00:16:56,152 --> 00:17:00,151
We had no connection to the
Gaddafi regime, none of us.

420
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,191
That's fine.

421
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:04,191
Now, can you tell us...

422
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:07,462
were any of these students yours?

423
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:12,361
What does this have to
do with my application

424
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:13,481
for citizenship?

425
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:15,323
As I said, this is all part

426
00:17:15,324 --> 00:17:16,402
of a routine background check.

427
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,404
- Ask about the father.
- No, it's too soon.

428
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:19,527
Too soon. No, don't ask.

429
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:20,651
Time is running out. Ask.

430
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:25,031
One of your students,
Hijriyyah Al Bouri,

431
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:26,611
was the daughter of Idris Al Bouri.

432
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,962
Do you remember her?

433
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:32,531
I'm sorry, my break is over.

434
00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:34,281
If you could answer the question.

435
00:17:34,282 --> 00:17:36,441
I don't remember.

436
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:38,281
I'm sorry.

437
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:40,821
Damn it.

438
00:17:40,822 --> 00:17:41,822
Well...

439
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:44,821
She clearly has something.

440
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:47,241
Yeah, we'll never get it now.

441
00:17:47,242 --> 00:17:49,712
Okay, we made the wrong approach.

442
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:53,241
Let's go to her openly.

443
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:55,111
We know she was a passionate teacher.

444
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:57,361
Let's see if you can connect
with her as an educator.

445
00:17:57,362 --> 00:17:59,531
That's a pretty big leap of faith.

446
00:17:59,532 --> 00:18:02,582
You're good at those, right?

447
00:18:07,612 --> 00:18:09,191
Ugh!

448
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:10,361
I give up.

449
00:18:10,362 --> 00:18:12,191
Want to watch a crappy pay-per-view?

450
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:16,191
Why can't I just explain it to them?

451
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:19,571
Because they grew up thinking
that all conflict is injustice.

452
00:18:19,572 --> 00:18:21,191
That's what you get

453
00:18:21,192 --> 00:18:22,981
for giving everyone a
trophy for showing up.

454
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:27,981
Well, for someone who got
quite a few of those trophies,

455
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,401
you turned out way cool,

456
00:18:29,402 --> 00:18:31,191
you know that?

457
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:32,571
Thanks, Ma.

458
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,904
- Hi. Sorry to bother you.
- Yes, well,

459
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:37,984
- teeming horde already beat you to it.
- Ah.

460
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:40,151
Are you never not fully groomed?

461
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,462
It's before 10:00 p.m.

462
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:45,481
I just got word from
Minister Torres's office.

463
00:18:45,482 --> 00:18:47,481
It seems that Chile has lifted the stay,

464
00:18:47,482 --> 00:18:50,321
and mining operations
will resume in the morning.

465
00:18:50,322 --> 00:18:53,321
Well, that's great news
for Russell Jackson,

466
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:56,481
not so good for the teeming horde.

467
00:18:56,482 --> 00:18:57,587
Yogurt pretzels, anyone?

468
00:18:57,588 --> 00:18:58,691
Ooh, me!

469
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:00,901
Which brings me to
my second bit of news.

470
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:03,462
Daisy wanted you to
see this immediately.

471
00:19:07,242 --> 00:19:10,241
Hello. I am Hugo.

472
00:19:10,242 --> 00:19:14,241
I am from the Inhawoji Nation
of the Magallanes in Chile.

473
00:19:14,242 --> 00:19:19,071
Inhawoji has lived on this
mountain for 6,000 years.

474
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:20,651
She is our mother.

475
00:19:20,652 --> 00:19:23,651
She gives us food, family, life.

476
00:19:23,652 --> 00:19:27,441
But the government of Chile
sell our home to the Americans.

477
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:29,441
They break our treaty

478
00:19:29,442 --> 00:19:32,861
and let them break our
mother and take her gold.

479
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:36,481
6,000 years of Inhawoji will be finish.

480
00:19:36,482 --> 00:19:39,321
I will not let this happen.

481
00:19:39,322 --> 00:19:42,901
I, Hugo, I will climb this mountain.

482
00:19:42,902 --> 00:19:44,481
I will save my home.

483
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:46,481
Or I will look at her one last time

484
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:48,401
before she is gone forever.

485
00:19:48,402 --> 00:19:50,241
Tell me this isn't real.

486
00:19:50,242 --> 00:19:53,241
It was posted by an indigenous
human rights group in Chile.

487
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:56,821
He made the same video in
Spanish and his native language.

488
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:59,241
It says he'll be doing a live feed

489
00:19:59,242 --> 00:20:01,281
until he reaches the top or dies,

490
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:02,282
whichever comes first.

491
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:03,282
He could die?

492
00:20:03,283 --> 00:20:06,281
Well, temperatures at the
peak at this time of year

493
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:09,321
average negative 40 degrees, so yes.

494
00:20:09,322 --> 00:20:12,481
If he's right,

495
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:17,321
if Chile violated a treaty with
their own indigenous people,

496
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:22,321
then everything that these
kids are yelling could be true.

497
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:25,481
I hate to say it, but if
this thing's up already,

498
00:20:25,482 --> 00:20:27,691
it kind of doesn't matter
whether it's true or not.

499
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:29,691
Not going there yet.

500
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:31,281
No, she's right.

501
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:34,031
Nobody cares about

502
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,031
the legal sale of mineral rights,

503
00:20:36,032 --> 00:20:40,611
but you give 'em an
indigenous James Franco

504
00:20:40,612 --> 00:20:43,611
taking his righteous cause
up the mountain with a GoPro?

505
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:45,241
Hey, what are you guys watching?

506
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:46,611
Is that The Amazing Race?

507
00:20:57,662 --> 00:21:00,744
The Ministry of Indigenous
Peoples is confirming

508
00:21:00,745 --> 00:21:03,333
that the Chilean government
did in fact violate

509
00:21:03,334 --> 00:21:05,243
a treaty with the Inhawoji people

510
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:08,073
when they sold the mineral
rights to their land

511
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:10,163
without their consent.

512
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:13,743
And no one ever thought
this was worth mentioning?

513
00:21:13,744 --> 00:21:16,333
Department of Commerce
admitted they got a report

514
00:21:16,334 --> 00:21:19,333
on the treaty violation
and then never passed it on.

515
00:21:19,334 --> 00:21:20,913
Has the president been informed?

516
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:22,623
Uh, they will be held accountable.

517
00:21:22,624 --> 00:21:24,373
Have we told Hercutel?

518
00:21:24,374 --> 00:21:25,743
I spoke with their PR rep.

519
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,573
They're saying they never knew
the glacier was native land.

520
00:21:28,574 --> 00:21:29,833
Cue the denials.

521
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:30,834
Not from us.

522
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:32,833
I want to be very clear on that.

523
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,993
Because the next time
student protesters yell at me

524
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,413
about letting this happen on my watch,

525
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:40,123
they're gonna be right.

526
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:43,783
Let's tell Hercutel they have
to shut down the operation.

527
00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:44,873
On it.

528
00:21:44,874 --> 00:21:45,953
Thank you, everyone.

529
00:21:45,954 --> 00:21:48,743
Uh, ma'am, there's one other thing.

530
00:21:48,744 --> 00:21:52,163
Uh, one of the students from
the confrontation yesterday

531
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:54,743
has filed a lawsuit against
the State Department.

532
00:21:54,744 --> 00:21:56,203
I'm sorry. Come again?

533
00:21:56,204 --> 00:22:00,703
He feels the DS agent
violated his personal space.

534
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,873
It's the confetti-bomb guy.

535
00:22:01,874 --> 00:22:05,123
They were a little
rough taking him down.

536
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:06,163
Uh, no, no,

537
00:22:06,164 --> 00:22:07,703
it was another one.

538
00:22:07,704 --> 00:22:10,743
The, uh, vocal one.

539
00:22:10,744 --> 00:22:11,464
The guy who was just

540
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:13,833
- standing there yelling at us?
- The screamer feels we violated his...

541
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,968
The government made me yell
and now my throat hurts?

542
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:17,701
Guys, do you know how
fast something like this

543
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:19,242
could turn an election?

544
00:22:19,243 --> 00:22:20,844
I mean, it's just
ridiculous enough to get

545
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:22,283
way more coverage than it deserves.

546
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:24,623
What's the kid's name?

547
00:22:24,624 --> 00:22:27,073
He's choosing not to
reveal that in the suit.

548
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,230
Brian Andrew Lindstrom.

549
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:30,725
He lives in Foster Hall.

550
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:31,923
We'll take care of it.

551
00:22:31,924 --> 00:22:33,913
No, no, no. This one I want.

552
00:22:33,914 --> 00:22:35,993
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
violate his personal space,

553
00:22:35,994 --> 00:22:37,485
much as I would love to.

554
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:39,202
We have the faculty tea in ten minutes.

555
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:40,913
The girls will meet us there.

556
00:22:40,914 --> 00:22:43,073
It's supposed to be by the library.

557
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:46,663
Oh, no, here we go.

558
00:22:50,414 --> 00:22:52,833
U.S. out of Chile! U.S. out of Chile!

559
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:54,493
They're in costume?

560
00:22:54,494 --> 00:22:57,073
Oh, God, I've got...
I've got to get this.

561
00:22:57,074 --> 00:22:58,783
What are you doing? Put that away.

562
00:22:58,784 --> 00:23:00,746
- Let go! Stop! Stop!
- Come on. They're coming.

563
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:02,663
Uh... hey, sorry.

564
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:03,764
It's cool.

565
00:23:05,494 --> 00:23:07,703
Your secret's safe with me.

566
00:23:07,704 --> 00:23:09,833
You know who I am?

567
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:11,330
It's chill.

568
00:23:11,331 --> 00:23:14,330
My dad's on the Chicago City Council.

569
00:23:14,331 --> 00:23:17,330
Actually, I was egged
once by a mob of teachers

570
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:19,960
at a contract negotiation,
so I totally understand

571
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:22,460
the fear of an angry public.

572
00:23:22,461 --> 00:23:23,371
I'm Ken.

573
00:23:23,372 --> 00:23:24,960
Alison.

574
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:26,620
Are you here for Prospective Week or...?

575
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:29,460
Yeah, we're supposed to go
to this faculty tea thing.

576
00:23:29,461 --> 00:23:31,080
Do you know where MacDougall Hall is?

577
00:23:31,081 --> 00:23:36,080
Yeah, it's right by the
library, other side of the quad.

578
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,330
This is my sister Stevie.

579
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:38,461
- Hey.
- Hey.

580
00:23:38,462 --> 00:23:39,461
We should go.

581
00:23:39,462 --> 00:23:41,120
What do you think of Rafferty?

582
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:42,290
It's cool.

583
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:44,040
I actually, I kind of
flamed out in high school,

584
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,870
so this is a pretty
good place to start over.

585
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:47,500
And how's the social life?

586
00:23:47,501 --> 00:23:49,750
Just the usual lame Greek stuff.

587
00:23:49,751 --> 00:23:52,333
- Sorry if you're into that kind of thing.
- No.

588
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:54,920
But there's actually a
party tonight off-campus.

589
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:57,080
My roommate's deejaying.
You should come by.

590
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:58,420
Maybe I will.

591
00:23:58,421 --> 00:24:01,370
Uh, the coast is clear.
But thanks for your help.

592
00:24:01,371 --> 00:24:03,471
Keep your head down.

593
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:09,211
Hey!

594
00:24:09,212 --> 00:24:11,040
The last thing that Mom needs right now

595
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,370
is for you to get busted
for underage drinking.

596
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:14,750
I won't drink.

597
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:17,040
Excuse me, Ms. Ayyad?

598
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,160
Yes?

599
00:24:18,161 --> 00:24:19,460
Hi, my name is Henry McCord.

600
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:20,540
I work for the U.S. government.

601
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,710
You're not in any trouble.

602
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,040
I just... I was just wondering

603
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,870
if I could have a few
minutes of your time?

604
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:26,500
Why do you people keep
showing up at my work?

605
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:27,870
I know you have my phone number.

606
00:24:27,871 --> 00:24:29,080
You can't call me?

607
00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:31,420
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

608
00:24:31,421 --> 00:24:33,250
I am studying for my citizenship.

609
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:35,250
I know I don't have to talk to you.

610
00:24:35,251 --> 00:24:37,790
And I already told the
last one everything I know,

611
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:40,750
which is nothing, so are we done here?

612
00:24:40,751 --> 00:24:45,500
Well, at least let me buy you a
cup of coffee for your trouble.

613
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:47,210
I haven't had lunch.

614
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:49,370
There's a diner around the corner.

615
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:51,431
I'll just have coffee, thanks.

616
00:24:54,331 --> 00:24:57,500
Do you like your job?

617
00:24:57,501 --> 00:25:01,330
Loading ink cartridges and
listening to idiots? Sure.

618
00:25:01,331 --> 00:25:03,141
You must miss teaching.

619
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:07,330
I miss a lot of things.

620
00:25:07,331 --> 00:25:09,080
I'm a teacher, too.

621
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:10,830
Ethics, morality, religious studies.

622
00:25:10,831 --> 00:25:13,460
But only to college
students, never high school.

623
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:16,040
Well, then you're missing something.

624
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:18,830
Lighting them up for the first time.

625
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:21,500
That age where they're so passionate.

626
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:24,710
Falling in love, getting
their hearts broken.

627
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:28,521
That's when poetry
can literally save you.

628
00:25:30,331 --> 00:25:32,250
I have two kids in high school.

629
00:25:32,251 --> 00:25:34,000
One is actually looking
at colleges right now.

630
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:35,120
It's killing me.

631
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:36,620
Lucky kid.

632
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:39,561
Wasn't an option for most of my girls.

633
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:46,330
We're interested in one
of your former students.

634
00:25:46,331 --> 00:25:49,000
Hijriyyah Al Bouri.

635
00:25:49,001 --> 00:25:51,420
We believe she was in your
Islamic literature class

636
00:25:51,421 --> 00:25:53,790
four years ago.

637
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:55,710
I don't remember her.

638
00:25:55,711 --> 00:25:57,710
But it was a very bad time.

639
00:25:57,711 --> 00:26:00,330
Many students disappeared.

640
00:26:00,331 --> 00:26:02,370
Laila, I want you to understand

641
00:26:02,371 --> 00:26:05,710
that nothing you say to me will
have any impact on your brother

642
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:07,710
or his family in Sirte.

643
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:10,561
You have my word, okay?

644
00:26:12,331 --> 00:26:15,290
Thank you.

645
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:19,000
This girl has been used
like a chess piece...

646
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:20,913
denied her freedom, denied an education,

647
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:24,330
forced into a horrible
situation against her will.

648
00:26:24,331 --> 00:26:28,000
And so now you want to use
her to get something you want.

649
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:31,391
So, still a chess piece.

650
00:26:33,331 --> 00:26:35,540
Your homeland is a mess right now.

651
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:37,021
That's why you're here.

652
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:41,160
I can't tell you why we
need to find Hijriyyah.

653
00:26:41,161 --> 00:26:43,160
But we believe that
what we're trying to do

654
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:44,920
could give Libya the chance to become

655
00:26:44,921 --> 00:26:46,420
the country it deserves to be,

656
00:26:46,421 --> 00:26:48,250
the country it should've
been after Gaddafi.

657
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:51,460
And this girl, who's had
so little opportunity,

658
00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:53,460
who's no longer allowed

659
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:56,420
to be educated by people like you,

660
00:26:56,421 --> 00:27:00,120
she could actually
help make that happen.

661
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:02,330
She could be the
beginning of a huge change.

662
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:05,851
For herself, for your country...

663
00:27:07,371 --> 00:27:09,471
...and for your family.

664
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:17,420
She had one foot out of school

665
00:27:17,421 --> 00:27:19,580
before she even
sh-showed up in my class.

666
00:27:19,581 --> 00:27:22,420
I-I barely remember her.

667
00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:24,000
So, you did teach her?

668
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:27,870
I doubt I taught her much.

669
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:29,290
What if I could help you

670
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:31,391
get the rest of your
family out of Libya?

671
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:35,040
Help you become a teacher again.

672
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:38,101
Would you be able to help me?

673
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:42,580
How?

674
00:27:42,581 --> 00:27:44,750
A group e-mail to all
her former students,

675
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:46,620
checking up on them after moving away.

676
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:48,710
Just a concerned teacher reaching out.

677
00:27:48,711 --> 00:27:49,997
No risk of exposure.

678
00:27:49,998 --> 00:27:52,580
And she thinks these old e-mail
addresses are still gonna work?

679
00:27:52,581 --> 00:27:54,830
This country doesn't have
running water right now,

680
00:27:54,831 --> 00:27:56,580
much less Internet access.

681
00:27:56,581 --> 00:27:57,581
Jose's right.

682
00:27:57,582 --> 00:27:58,960
Let's send in Special Ops.

683
00:27:58,961 --> 00:28:00,290
Why bother with an inexpensive,

684
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:02,250
low-risk, nonviolent option
that could yield Intel?

685
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:05,420
The idea being if this girl responds...?

686
00:28:05,421 --> 00:28:06,830
We get an I.P. address,

687
00:28:06,831 --> 00:28:08,870
which gets us that much closer to Disah.

688
00:28:08,871 --> 00:28:11,120
At least get a drone on her and wait.

689
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:12,250
See if he shows up.

690
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:13,710
Hey, at worst, we get some hits

691
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:15,920
from other students we can try to use.

692
00:28:15,921 --> 00:28:17,960
There are some Internet cafes.

693
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:19,370
It's worth a shot.

694
00:28:19,371 --> 00:28:21,540
The e-mail would have to
go through us, obviously.

695
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,370
Everything will be
linked to our servers.

696
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:24,920
Any replies will come straight to us.

697
00:28:24,921 --> 00:28:26,471
Laila already sent me a draft.

698
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:31,370
You got till tomorrow morning
to see if you get any hits.

699
00:28:31,371 --> 00:28:33,960
Then we move on with Jose's plan.

700
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:35,370
Excuse me, guys.

701
00:28:35,371 --> 00:28:37,293
Sorry.

702
00:28:37,294 --> 00:28:39,750
Why are we here? This is embarrassing.

703
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:43,160
It's a teachable moment, and
I want you to be a part of it.

704
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:45,080
At least we're getting a
good look at student housing.

705
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:46,578
- Right.
- Uh, excuse me, fellas?

706
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:47,865
Brian Lindstrom's room?

707
00:28:47,866 --> 00:28:49,716
- Uh, 417.
- Oh.

708
00:28:50,866 --> 00:28:53,655
Hey, Brian, Secretary of
State Elizabeth McCord.

709
00:28:53,656 --> 00:28:55,905
Uh, yeah, I know.

710
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:58,495
I wanted to follow up on
our conversation yesterday.

711
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,390
Uh, look, if this is
about the harassment suit,

712
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:02,507
you'll have to talk to my lawyer.

713
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:03,967
Right, about that.

714
00:29:03,968 --> 00:29:07,967
Um, I understand that you
felt threatened by Matt here.

715
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,216
And he's an intimidating guy,

716
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:11,967
especially when he thinks I'm in danger.

717
00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:14,637
But he was just doing his job.

718
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:17,637
Sorry if I violated
your safe space, Brian.

719
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:19,677
Nice try, guys.

720
00:29:19,678 --> 00:29:22,296
But you can't just show up
to my door and intimidate me

721
00:29:22,297 --> 00:29:24,297
like I'm some developing
nation you can't control.

722
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:25,597
That's right.

723
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:26,927
I can't.

724
00:29:26,928 --> 00:29:29,427
But I-I think I know someone who can.

725
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:31,220
- Blake?
- Yeah.

726
00:29:31,221 --> 00:29:33,217
Hello? Can you hear me?

727
00:29:33,218 --> 00:29:34,427
Mom?

728
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:36,733
Brian, what is going on?

729
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,639
You're suing the Secretary of State

730
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,216
for violating you?

731
00:29:40,217 --> 00:29:42,115
You know what "violating" means?

732
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:44,198
: Do you want to do this inside?

733
00:29:59,384 --> 00:30:01,388
I have a right to a safe
learning environment.

734
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:02,929
That's what you guys are paying for.

735
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,773
We're paying for you
to get an education.

736
00:30:04,774 --> 00:30:06,936
And I'm starting to wonder
if it's money well spent.

737
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:09,055
And a lawsuit against
the U.S. government.

738
00:30:09,056 --> 00:30:10,725
Who's paying for that?

739
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,805
There's a legal aid clinic in town.

740
00:30:12,806 --> 00:30:13,975
They fight against injustice.

741
00:30:13,976 --> 00:30:15,765
Will you listen to this kid?

742
00:30:15,766 --> 00:30:17,435
Some security guy bumping into you

743
00:30:17,436 --> 00:30:18,765
is not an injustice.

744
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:21,269
I was exercising my
right to free speech.

745
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,519
They were trying to silence me!

746
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,804
God, it's like he's two.

747
00:30:24,805 --> 00:30:27,184
You're dropping the lawsuit, Bri.

748
00:30:27,185 --> 00:30:29,014
Or you can pay your own tuition.

749
00:30:29,015 --> 00:30:30,354
If I may, um,

750
00:30:30,355 --> 00:30:33,822
I think the thing getting lost here,

751
00:30:33,823 --> 00:30:37,242
uh, Mr. and Mrs. Lindstrom, is

752
00:30:37,243 --> 00:30:41,782
your son's passionate
commitment to social justice.

753
00:30:41,783 --> 00:30:44,282
Young people rising up against

754
00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:46,902
the abuse of power has been
a force for change many times

755
00:30:46,903 --> 00:30:49,072
in this country, and Brian was right.

756
00:30:49,073 --> 00:30:52,822
Not about the mining
contract... that was legitimate.

757
00:30:52,823 --> 00:30:55,322
But about the larger issue.

758
00:30:55,323 --> 00:30:57,532
The brutal legacy of colonialism

759
00:30:57,533 --> 00:30:59,862
asserting itself once again in Chile.

760
00:30:59,863 --> 00:31:04,072
That... turned out to be true.

761
00:31:04,073 --> 00:31:07,612
And, Brian, without you
guys and the Chilean citizens

762
00:31:07,613 --> 00:31:10,202
rising up against what
you thought was wrong,

763
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:11,902
the Inhawoji people

764
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,952
might not have dared
raise their voices, too,

765
00:31:13,953 --> 00:31:16,662
and found a world ready to listen.

766
00:31:16,663 --> 00:31:18,452
Thanks, Mrs. Secretary.

767
00:31:18,453 --> 00:31:20,383
Madam Secretary.

768
00:31:21,743 --> 00:31:24,572
Don't stop speaking truth to power.

769
00:31:24,573 --> 00:31:26,492
But maybe

770
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:30,112
the best way to call
upon our better selves

771
00:31:30,113 --> 00:31:32,383
is for you to show us yours.

772
00:31:39,073 --> 00:31:41,072
Come on, don't hold back.

773
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:43,402
How'd you get college
baby to drop the lawsuit?

774
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:45,072
Was it a total smack down?

775
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:47,782
Let's just say his parents
helped him see reason.

776
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:49,782
She's being modest. It was a smack down.

777
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,822
Where are we with Hercutel?

778
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:54,072
Well, the head of operations

779
00:31:54,073 --> 00:31:56,742
in Chile was less than thrilled

780
00:31:56,743 --> 00:32:00,452
to be told to suspend operations
only hours after resuming them.

781
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:03,322
Now Chile is demanding to be reimbursed

782
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:06,072
for the loss of royalties
from the sale of the land.

783
00:32:06,073 --> 00:32:08,032
Wait, what?

784
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:12,083
How are they in a
position to demand anything

785
00:32:12,084 --> 00:32:14,202
when they're the ones
who violated the treaty

786
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:16,572
with their own people?

787
00:32:16,573 --> 00:32:19,492
Actually, Chile does have
the right to be compensated.

788
00:32:19,493 --> 00:32:21,202
But we might have a solution.

789
00:32:21,203 --> 00:32:23,612
We consulted with
International Crisis Collective,

790
00:32:23,613 --> 00:32:25,612
an environmental NGO based in Chile.

791
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:28,322
It turns out it's feasible
to move the mining site

792
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:31,902
lower on the glacier,
preserving the Inhawoji's land,

793
00:32:31,903 --> 00:32:34,742
and instead go up inside the
glacier to extract the gold.

794
00:32:34,743 --> 00:32:38,032
That sounds like a move
I tried in high school.

795
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:41,072
What's the catch?

796
00:32:41,073 --> 00:32:43,952
Well, it's expensive, for one thing.

797
00:32:43,953 --> 00:32:45,612
And would require the oversight

798
00:32:45,613 --> 00:32:48,572
of a third party NGO
to ensure the process

799
00:32:48,573 --> 00:32:50,822
preserves the agriculture
of the Inhawoji people.

800
00:32:50,823 --> 00:32:53,952
But if we can figure that part out,

801
00:32:53,953 --> 00:32:55,782
Hercutel gets to keep its gold,

802
00:32:55,783 --> 00:33:00,532
Dalton gets to keep his
favorite congressman happy,

803
00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:05,162
and Hugo can come down from
the mountain and go home.

804
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:08,072
It's like we solved a
Rubik's Cube with our feet.

805
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:10,072
Yeah, well, speaking of which,

806
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:13,282
where is Chile with the
rescue mission for Hugo?

807
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:16,242
It looks like he's
really getting up there.

808
00:33:16,243 --> 00:33:18,112
They were planning a
rescue this afternoon,

809
00:33:18,113 --> 00:33:21,612
but a blizzard started
kicking up near the peak, so...

810
00:33:21,613 --> 00:33:23,843
they're waiting for conditions to clear.

811
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:27,282
We got a hit.

812
00:33:27,283 --> 00:33:28,109
From Hijriyyah?

813
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,075
- Just now.
- What's the I.P.?

814
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:32,282
I don't know yet; we
just... it just came in.

815
00:33:36,073 --> 00:33:38,612
South Korea. They're
covering their tracks.

816
00:33:38,613 --> 00:33:41,112
At least we know she's got Internet.

817
00:33:41,113 --> 00:33:43,213
I'll run this through a translator.

818
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,662
"My dear Miss Ayyad:

819
00:33:46,663 --> 00:33:48,242
"It is strange to hear from you,

820
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:50,112
"like a message from another lifetime.

821
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:53,612
"You'll be surprised to hear
that I think of you often.

822
00:33:53,613 --> 00:33:57,282
"You'll hardly recognize
Tripoli now, or me.

823
00:33:57,283 --> 00:33:59,473
"But I still remember
the afternoon you took us

824
00:33:59,474 --> 00:34:02,112
"to the courtyard to
eat pistachio ice cream

825
00:34:02,113 --> 00:34:03,662
"and read from the Qur'an.

826
00:34:03,663 --> 00:34:06,282
"I think often of a
verse you read that day:

827
00:34:06,283 --> 00:34:08,242
"'Tell he who carries their sorrows

828
00:34:08,243 --> 00:34:11,282
"'that there is no sorrow that endures.

829
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:15,162
"Just as delight perishes,
so too perishes sorrow.'

830
00:34:15,163 --> 00:34:17,572
"I love that verse.

831
00:34:17,573 --> 00:34:20,322
"And I remember the one after.

832
00:34:20,323 --> 00:34:22,282
"I hope you are well in a new country

833
00:34:22,283 --> 00:34:24,902
"and that you still
enjoy pistachio ice cream.

834
00:34:24,903 --> 00:34:28,032
Hijriyyah."

835
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:29,112
That's a good hit.

836
00:34:29,113 --> 00:34:31,242
That verse is not from the Qur'an.

837
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:32,402
No, it's not.

838
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,822
It's from A Thousand
and One Arabian Nights.

839
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,572
What? Oh, of course it is.

840
00:34:36,573 --> 00:34:38,992
Yeah, it's from the
beginning, right before

841
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,227
Scheherazade's father marries
her off to King Shahryar,

842
00:34:41,228 --> 00:34:44,032
who's been marrying and killing
a new virgin every night.

843
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:45,402
It's a pretty obvious reference.

844
00:34:45,403 --> 00:34:49,072
Maybe Laila will remember
what verse they read next.

845
00:34:49,073 --> 00:34:53,282
Or maybe it's just what
comes right after that line.

846
00:34:53,283 --> 00:34:54,402
Okay, listen to this.

847
00:34:54,403 --> 00:34:57,612
"God be upon you, Father,
marry me to this king.

848
00:34:57,613 --> 00:35:00,242
"For either I live or, in dying,
I will rescue the daughters

849
00:35:00,243 --> 00:35:02,202
of the Muslims from his hands."

850
00:35:02,203 --> 00:35:04,322
Sounds like more of the same.

851
00:35:04,323 --> 00:35:06,602
She's bummed her father married
her off to a ruthless terrorist.

852
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:08,523
Or she's ready to be
part of something greater.

853
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:09,435
Yeah, maybe.

854
00:35:09,436 --> 00:35:11,313
Either way, she's sending
up a distress signal.

855
00:35:11,314 --> 00:35:14,353
And it's possible that she's willing

856
00:35:14,354 --> 00:35:15,853
to save more than just herself.

857
00:35:15,854 --> 00:35:17,563
Well, if that's true,

858
00:35:17,564 --> 00:35:19,983
we might have more than
just a way to find Disah.

859
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:22,023
We might have an asset inside his house

860
00:35:22,024 --> 00:35:24,124
ready to take him down.

861
00:35:26,774 --> 00:35:29,353
Ali, people are going crazy

862
00:35:29,354 --> 00:35:32,044
about these protesters
dressing up like natives.

863
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:49,687
_

864
00:35:51,814 --> 00:35:53,693
They can't get the chopper

865
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,066
up there because of the blizzard,

866
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:57,353
so they're gonna have to
wait till tomorrow morning.

867
00:35:57,354 --> 00:35:59,063
It's unbearable.

868
00:35:59,064 --> 00:36:00,813
You got to admire his courage.

869
00:36:00,814 --> 00:36:03,603
Not to mention the genius
use of social media.

870
00:36:03,604 --> 00:36:05,903
That part makes me even more nervous.

871
00:36:05,904 --> 00:36:09,443
If this guy doesn't make it, God forbid,

872
00:36:09,444 --> 00:36:12,483
he's gonna become an easy symbol
for everyone who wants to paint

873
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:14,443
the U.S. as heartless imperialists.

874
00:36:14,444 --> 00:36:17,026
Won't matter that it wasn't our doing.

875
00:36:17,814 --> 00:36:21,853
Hey. Uh, Ali wants to go to this
poetry reading thing on campus.

876
00:36:21,854 --> 00:36:23,273
I told her I'd take her.

877
00:36:23,274 --> 00:36:25,813
Uh, do you mind?

878
00:36:25,814 --> 00:36:27,773
No, not at all.

879
00:36:27,774 --> 00:36:30,103
We'll be back by, like,
11:00 or something.

880
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,353
Um, poetry reading?

881
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:35,233
: I know.

882
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,943
It's like she's this whole other person.

883
00:36:37,944 --> 00:36:42,853
Today, she... wait a minute...
she sat in on this design class,

884
00:36:42,854 --> 00:36:45,233
and she brought back the
most incredible drawings.

885
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:47,844
You cannot believe it. It's...

886
00:36:50,814 --> 00:36:52,443
Babe, are you seeing this?

887
00:36:59,854 --> 00:37:01,954
Henry.

888
00:37:15,553 --> 00:37:17,761
No, no, the witch who
hatched all the dragon eggs.

889
00:37:17,762 --> 00:37:19,511
She's not a witch.

890
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:21,802
She's one of the last survivors
of the House Targaryen,

891
00:37:21,803 --> 00:37:24,641
which you would know
if you read the books.

892
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,622
Thank you for the mansplain, Kenneth.

893
00:37:27,883 --> 00:37:29,743
What are you doing here?

894
00:37:32,552 --> 00:37:34,972
Do you know how much
trouble you would be in

895
00:37:34,973 --> 00:37:36,841
if Mom knew that you were here?

896
00:37:36,842 --> 00:37:40,591
So I wanted to be a
normal person for one hour.

897
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,721
What's the big deal?

898
00:37:41,722 --> 00:37:43,641
You cannot just take
off without telling us.

899
00:37:43,642 --> 00:37:45,641
I'm not you, okay?

900
00:37:45,642 --> 00:37:47,524
I'm not gonna flame out my first year

901
00:37:47,525 --> 00:37:49,514
- because I can't deal.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

902
00:37:49,515 --> 00:37:50,971
And you know why?

903
00:37:50,972 --> 00:37:53,681
Because you make
everything this huge deal.

904
00:37:53,682 --> 00:37:55,681
When was the last time
you did something fun?

905
00:37:55,682 --> 00:37:57,641
I'm fun.

906
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:58,642
No, you're not.

907
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,341
And neither is Mom.

908
00:38:00,342 --> 00:38:03,841
You've both completely lost
your ability to have fun.

909
00:38:03,842 --> 00:38:05,261
Great.

910
00:38:06,302 --> 00:38:07,841
Great. Yeah, okay.

911
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:09,721
Come on, guys, delete the photos.

912
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:10,722
Or what?

913
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:13,641
Your mom and her fascist
goons will hunt me down?

914
00:38:13,642 --> 00:38:16,801
Fascism is the direct opposite
of a representative democracy,

915
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:19,681
which you happen to be
lucky enough to live in

916
00:38:19,682 --> 00:38:22,881
thanks to people like our mother
who defend it every single day.

917
00:38:22,882 --> 00:38:25,971
And by the way, you attacking

918
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:28,091
and trying to silence people
because they don't agree

919
00:38:28,092 --> 00:38:31,822
with what you think kind
of makes you the fascist.

920
00:38:39,722 --> 00:38:42,511
I just wrote a paper on World War Two.

921
00:38:42,512 --> 00:38:44,551
Nice work on Mussolini.

922
00:38:45,682 --> 00:38:48,551
Heavy snowfall and strong winds

923
00:38:48,552 --> 00:38:51,573
triggered the deadly avalanche
that struck earlier tonight...

924
00:38:51,574 --> 00:38:54,591
I have confirmation
the Chilean rescue team

925
00:38:54,592 --> 00:38:55,801
is due within an hour.

926
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:57,841
Let's hope he can hold on.

927
00:38:58,882 --> 00:39:00,641
Hey.

928
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:01,681
Hey.

929
00:39:01,682 --> 00:39:02,592
What's going on?

930
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:03,971
Uh, there was an avalanche.

931
00:39:03,972 --> 00:39:06,072
We lost contact with Hugo.

932
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:10,591
...for mining its glaciers for gold.

933
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,591
A major rescue operation is underway.

934
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:14,668
How could he possibly
survive an avalanche?

935
00:39:15,384 --> 00:39:17,431
It's all about the crucial first minutes

936
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:18,721
before the snow settles.

937
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:20,681
You get an arm up in front of your face,

938
00:39:20,682 --> 00:39:22,761
create an air pocket
so that you can breathe.

939
00:39:22,762 --> 00:39:24,721
Then you spit to see which way is up.

940
00:39:24,722 --> 00:39:26,511
Swim like mad to get to the surface,

941
00:39:26,512 --> 00:39:28,112
hopefully before you suffocate.

942
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:33,652
What? Boy Scouts.

943
00:39:35,592 --> 00:39:37,551
Ma'am, while we're waiting,

944
00:39:37,552 --> 00:39:40,681
would you like an update
on the Hercutel deal?

945
00:39:40,682 --> 00:39:41,552
Might as well.

946
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:44,181
The International Crisis Collective

947
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:46,641
has agreed to supervise
the new mining methods.

948
00:39:46,642 --> 00:39:49,011
The Ministry of Mining
in Chile is drafting

949
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,641
a contract right now.

950
00:39:50,642 --> 00:39:52,801
And Hercutel... they
agreed to the new deal?

951
00:39:52,802 --> 00:39:54,801
The CEO was dodging my calls all day,

952
00:39:54,802 --> 00:39:57,221
but I just got word from his assistant.

953
00:39:57,222 --> 00:39:59,591
After meeting with the board,
Hercutel determined that,

954
00:39:59,592 --> 00:40:01,881
rather than risk the projected
nine percent reduction

955
00:40:01,882 --> 00:40:05,221
in profits in the
alternate extraction method,

956
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:08,681
the company will move the operation

957
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:11,591
to another gold deposit
in the Argentine Andes

958
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:13,181
near Tucumán.

959
00:40:13,182 --> 00:40:14,641
So all that was for nothing?

960
00:40:14,642 --> 00:40:16,721
If I'm not mistaken,

961
00:40:16,722 --> 00:40:19,181
doesn't that still solve
all of our problems?

962
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:22,551
If you mean Hercutel still gets
to rape the land with impunity...

963
00:40:22,552 --> 00:40:24,051
uh, sorry,

964
00:40:24,052 --> 00:40:25,971
extract precious minerals...

965
00:40:25,972 --> 00:40:27,681
then, yeah, it works out for them.

966
00:40:27,682 --> 00:40:28,642
And the White House

967
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:30,641
keeps Senator Westrick happy.

968
00:40:30,642 --> 00:40:32,181
And President Contreras gets to say

969
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:34,511
she effectively stopped the Americans

970
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:36,641
from mining her country's resources.

971
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,841
So, win for her.

972
00:40:37,842 --> 00:40:39,804
- You guys.
- Look.

973
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:43,261
We have confirmed movement,
which appears to be

974
00:40:43,262 --> 00:40:45,181
the Inhawoji man who
was climbing the glacier.

975
00:40:45,182 --> 00:40:46,182
: Whoa. What?

976
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:49,261
We are confirming Hugo is alive.

977
00:40:49,262 --> 00:40:50,431
That's amazing.

978
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,051
He has survived the avalanche.

979
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:53,721
Yeah!

980
00:40:53,722 --> 00:40:55,261
The youth vote is saved.

981
00:40:56,762 --> 00:40:59,381
That, my friends,

982
00:40:59,382 --> 00:41:02,511
is as close as we're going
to get to a happy ending.

983
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:24,011
Mom? Mom?

984
00:41:24,012 --> 00:41:25,721
Hmm?

985
00:41:25,722 --> 00:41:26,881
We need to talk.

986
00:41:26,882 --> 00:41:29,091
Is it protesters? What?

987
00:41:29,092 --> 00:41:31,742
No. It's Alison.

988
00:41:33,682 --> 00:41:36,942
She says we're not fun.

989
00:41:37,882 --> 00:41:39,761
What?

990
00:41:39,762 --> 00:41:42,942
She said that we used to
be fun and now we're not.

991
00:41:44,682 --> 00:41:47,181
Stevie, can we just...

992
00:41:47,182 --> 00:41:51,971
Let's wait till tomorrow when
we're at the breakfast buffet

993
00:41:51,972 --> 00:41:54,551
with those waffles and the weird bacon.

994
00:41:54,552 --> 00:41:57,011
Mom, she's right.

995
00:41:58,592 --> 00:42:00,141
When's the last time we played cards?

996
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:01,341
: What?

997
00:42:01,342 --> 00:42:03,881
We used to play cards all the time.

998
00:42:03,882 --> 00:42:05,931
And you would let me eat
that marshmallow creme

999
00:42:05,932 --> 00:42:07,931
straight out of the jar.

1000
00:42:07,932 --> 00:42:09,841
We never do stuff like that anymore.

1001
00:42:09,842 --> 00:42:12,971
Because the marshmallow
creme, it made you sick.

1002
00:42:12,972 --> 00:42:13,972
No.

1003
00:42:13,973 --> 00:42:17,652
We're so careful all the time.

1004
00:42:25,052 --> 00:42:26,982
You want to play Go Fish?

1005
00:42:28,932 --> 00:42:30,551
No.

1006
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,144
Let's go! Come on, Mom!

1007
00:42:36,145 --> 00:42:39,591
Ma'am, I do need to
advise you against this.

1008
00:42:39,592 --> 00:42:41,301
Advice taken.

1009
00:42:41,302 --> 00:42:42,761
Do you have a tray?

1010
00:42:42,762 --> 00:42:44,862
No, ma'am, I don't.

1011
00:42:47,012 --> 00:42:48,721
You're gonna have a
hard time keeping up.

1012
00:42:48,722 --> 00:42:50,431
Ma'am, I really don't...

1013
00:42:50,432 --> 00:42:51,577
Set?

1014
00:42:51,578 --> 00:42:52,721
Yes.

1015
00:42:52,722 --> 00:42:54,551
And go, go!

1016
00:43:00,222 --> 00:43:01,931
Ma'am!

1017
00:43:07,142 --> 00:43:09,152
Ma'am?

1018
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:16,011
