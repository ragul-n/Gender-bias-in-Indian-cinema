3
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:07,746
- Help me.
- Where will you go now?

4
00:04:07,786 --> 00:04:10,103
I have found you after
such a long time!

5
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:13,120
She shouldn't be able to run away!

6
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:16,192
Who is this?

7
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:32,981
Thank you prince.

8
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,569
If you wouldn't come on time today..

9
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:35,894
I and you would never
be able to meet.

10
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:37,622
You called me and I arrived.

11
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,141
I risked my life and came to you.

12
00:04:39,182 --> 00:04:40,519
My beautiful, my apple of the eye!

13
00:04:40,543 --> 00:04:41,613
Oh! Prince!

14
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,519
You got up!

15
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,762
Raju!

16
00:04:52,022 --> 00:04:53,022
Raju!

17
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:54,277
Raju!

18
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:55,555
Raju!

19
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Raju!

20
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,063
Raju!

21
00:05:01,095 --> 00:05:03,107
- Mr. Director..
- Yes.

22
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:04,838
I have been telling
you since so many..

23
00:05:04,862 --> 00:05:06,262
Years to forget the dream
of being a king or a emperor.

24
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:08,603
This is an orphanage.
This isn't any royal palace.

25
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,277
You act as a king and create
a hullabaloo here.

26
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:15,924
Right now. You are fluttering
your eyelashes like a goat.

27
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:18,279
And you also know that I
will forgive you but..

28
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,922
No, Mr. Director, don't forgive him.

29
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:23,361
He had called me beautiful.

30
00:05:23,401 --> 00:05:26,976
And he had kissed me too!

31
00:05:27,016 --> 00:05:29,254
Mr. Director, he called me a wretch.

32
00:05:30,194 --> 00:05:31,961
I will forgive you today.

33
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:34,303
But tomorrow, on the arrival
of the princess..

34
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:37,020
If you do any such antics,
I won't forgive you ever!

35
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:38,643
What did you say, Mr. Director?

36
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:41,088
Is a princess coming here?

37
00:05:41,362 --> 00:05:43,850
Yes. To distribute clothes and
sweets amongst your orphans.

38
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:46,013
But beware, I repeat.

39
00:05:46,123 --> 00:05:50,065
If you do any madness in her
presence I swear on all..

40
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:53,125
The orphans in India I will
kick you out in a snap!

41
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:57,110
Even I swear on all the
orphans of India..

42
00:05:57,284 --> 00:06:00,196
I won't do anything like that
in the princess's presence.

43
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:01,846
If you say so, I won't
even look at her.

44
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,668
I will just play the
flute and sing songs.

45
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:25,359
Greetings, Princess.

46
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:27,871
He is the prince of Raipur.

47
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:31,571
He was free, therefore
I brought him along.

48
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:33,348
He is more than welcome, Princess..

49
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:41,174
"We search for the gaze
of some one merciful."

50
00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:48,413
"We search for the gaze
of some one merciful."

51
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:55,937
"The one who would support,
we search for that arch."

52
00:06:55,977 --> 00:07:03,289
"The one who would support,
we search for that arch."

53
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:10,713
"We search for the gaze
of some one merciful."

54
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:18,329
"We search for the gaze
of some one merciful."

55
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:47,289
"In your paths, we have
always called out."

56
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:54,409
"In your paths, we have
always called out."

57
00:07:54,546 --> 00:08:01,853
"We have blessed you throughout
your life."

58
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:09,239
"We have blessed you throughout
your life."

59
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:16,631
"We search for the effects
of our blessings."

60
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:23,955
"We search for the effects
of our blessings."

61
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:31,349
"We search for the gaze
of some one merciful."

62
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:38,698
"We search for the gaze
of some one merciful."

63
00:08:52,621 --> 00:09:00,056
"Happiness blooms in the
lucky people's gardens."

64
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:07,194
"Happiness blooms in the
lucky people's gardens."

65
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:14,365
"Sometimes, people get happiness
by searching."

66
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:21,592
"Sometimes, people get happiness
by searching."

67
00:09:21,632 --> 00:09:28,918
"But we search unknowingly."

68
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:36,148
"But we search unknowingly."

69
00:09:36,188 --> 00:09:43,391
"We search for the gaze
of some one merciful."

70
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:50,602
"We search for the gaze
of some one merciful."

71
00:09:50,642 --> 00:09:58,082
"The one who would support,
we search for that arch."

72
00:09:58,123 --> 00:10:05,384
"The one who would support,
we search for that arch."

73
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:12,450
"We search for the gaze
of some one merciful."

74
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:20,546
"We search for the gaze
of some one merciful."

75
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:25,278
Raju, what did you do?

76
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:27,023
Princess, please forgive him!

77
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:29,010
You ask charity for these
insolent children?

78
00:10:29,184 --> 00:10:30,389
He has gone crazy.

79
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,615
If he has gone mad, send
him to an asylum.

80
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,396
You are our only support.
Please forgive him!

81
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,093
Please have mercy on these orphans!
For God's sake!

82
00:11:13,436 --> 00:11:15,960
Here is the tea, drink
it while it's hot.

83
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:18,177
Here, drink it.

84
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:20,975
- I don't want it.
- Why? - I don't have money.

85
00:11:21,353 --> 00:11:23,427
That's it? I will give
you one slap now!

86
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:25,404
Do you talk about money
with a friend?

87
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:27,863
Am I dead, isn't it? Drink it!

88
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,063
Drink it. Come on.

89
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:39,142
Listen..

90
00:11:40,186 --> 00:11:42,762
Even I was chucked out of
the orphanage like you.

91
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,091
Did I starve?

92
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:45,363
Your matter was different.

93
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:48,089
And your matter! Why
don't you understand?

94
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:50,082
Even you have a beard and
moustache on your face.

95
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:52,304
So, what is my mistake if I
got a moustache and beard?

96
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:55,455
Your problem is that you didn't
get brains with the beard.

97
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:58,782
Good that the orphanage people
removed you.

98
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:01,612
You won't dream about being
a king the whole day.

99
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,759
You will do some work at least.
You will earn with your hands.

100
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:07,744
I will just get food to eat
twice if I earn with my ends.

101
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:10,953
- Do you want to eat six times in a day?
- No.

102
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:15,038
I want to become a king.

103
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:17,255
I know that. I know that, my dad!

104
00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:18,594
And may the almighty make you one.

105
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:19,947
But till the time you become one..

106
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:22,252
Won't you work as something
or not to fill you stomach?

107
00:12:22,314 --> 00:12:23,754
What work do I know?

108
00:12:23,794 --> 00:12:25,120
Who will give me any iob?

109
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:27,756
Leave that responsibility to me.

110
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:30,383
I will arrange an excellent
job for you, okay?

111
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:37,562
- How many liters, sir?
- Ten.

112
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:10,082
Hey, hey what are you doing?
Are you sleeping?

113
00:13:10,162 --> 00:13:11,673
You fool, you donkey!

114
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:13,571
Even water isn't pumped
out in Bombay..

115
00:13:13,595 --> 00:13:15,060
Like how you have
squandered my petrol.

116
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:16,684
Take your uniform and
get lost from here.

117
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:19,364
Sir, you well has a lot of petrol.
But if you remove me..

118
00:13:19,658 --> 00:13:22,418
I won't get a iob anywhere else.

119
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,762
And you shouldn't get
another job too!

120
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,455
- Sir..
- I said, get out.

121
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:00,019
I was calling you since when!

122
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:01,571
You weren't listening to me at all.

123
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:03,158
Were you dreaming about something?

124
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:07,206
- Should I tell you?
- Tell me.

125
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:17,804
"Raju has a dream, Raju, the king,
the respected king."

126
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:25,219
"Raju has a dream, Raju, the king,
the respected king."

127
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:27,744
"There isn't any kingdom
or any crown."

128
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,140
"Even then, I am a respected king."

129
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,105
"Raju has a dream, Raju, the king,
the respected king."

130
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:40,374
"Raju has a dream, Raju, the king,
the respected king."

131
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:08,768
"The sad stories which
exist on my lips."

132
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:18,871
"I love them, they are my queens."

133
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:25,339
"They are my queens,
I can't be compared."

134
00:15:25,473 --> 00:15:30,571
"Raju has a dream, Raju, the king,
the respected king."

135
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:35,594
"Raju has a dream, Raju, the king,
the respected king."

136
00:15:55,589 --> 00:16:00,372
"So what if I am on the iourney."

137
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:04,869
"It's okay if I am not
on the destination."

138
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:13,562
"Okay, accepted, it is all right,
not on my heart."

139
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:19,912
"Not on my heart, there
is beauty in my sadness."

140
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:24,862
"Raju has a dream, Raju, the king,
the respected king."

141
00:16:25,023 --> 00:16:29,980
"Raju has a dream, Raju, the king,
the respected king."

142
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:58,400
"Listen. There are sad
fables in my gatherings."

143
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:05,301
"The mischief of helplessness."

144
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,451
"The goblets of pain."

145
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:14,660
"The goblets of pain and
the liquor of tears."

146
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:19,584
"Raju has a dream, Raju, the king,
the respected king."

147
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:24,510
"Raju has a dream, Raju, the king,
the respected king."

148
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:29,476
"There isn't any kingdom
or any crown."

149
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:34,273
"Raju has a dream, Raju, the king,
the respected king."

150
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:39,188
"Raju has a dream, Raju, the king,
the respected king."

151
00:17:58,147 --> 00:18:00,458
I explained to you so many times.

152
00:18:00,499 --> 00:18:02,309
Why don't you understand?

153
00:18:02,384 --> 00:18:05,478
Raju, you were born Raju
and you will stay Raju.

154
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:07,918
Whether you dream about being
a king or an emperor.

155
00:18:08,607 --> 00:18:12,947
See, I will give you
a last chance now.

156
00:18:14,155 --> 00:18:15,908
Yes, really.

157
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:19,717
And if you dream while
your work hours..

158
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:21,165
Then it is you and
your fate after that.

159
00:18:21,189 --> 00:18:23,440
- It is enough for me now.
- Sir, brain fry..

160
00:18:24,324 --> 00:18:26,545
- Bring some brain fry.
- Fry sir's brains.

161
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,895
Mr. D'Mello. This is our Raju.

162
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:31,220
I had talked about a boy yesterday.

163
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,630
Yes, Raju.

164
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:42,958
Do you know how to massage?

165
00:18:44,214 --> 00:18:44,753
Massage.

166
00:18:44,793 --> 00:18:46,695
A body massage.

167
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:49,312
Some boys and girls are needed..

168
00:18:49,352 --> 00:18:52,558
For training as masseurs
where Mr. D'Mello works.

169
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,794
The salary is one fifty
rupees, isn't it?

170
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,311
And tips on top of that.

171
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,944
Nobody gives anything less
that five or ten rupees.

172
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:03,909
The rich, the mill owners,
Britishers, kings...

173
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,444
Yes, kings and emperors.

174
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:14,579
They call us to their homes
and make us massage them.

175
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,705
And on top of that, they
give us big tips.

176
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:18,077
Is that the matter?

177
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:20,970
Even I will become a masseur,
I will surely become one.

178
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:12,296
Greetings, your maiesty..

179
00:20:16,906 --> 00:20:17,834
Are you new?

180
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,918
Yes, D'Mello has sent me.

181
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:25,162
His maiesty is up.

182
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,510
His maiesty is upstairs.

183
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:31,753
And listen, the king likes to
be massaged in his sleep.

184
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:34,567
Have you brought the oils?

185
00:20:34,804 --> 00:20:36,676
Yes? Yes.

186
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,081
- Do you see those stairs?
- Yes.

187
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,226
Go up.

188
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:41,016
Yes?

189
00:20:41,163 --> 00:20:42,811
- Go!
- Yes.

190
00:21:22,832 --> 00:21:23,875
Your maiesty..

191
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,375
Your maiesty..

192
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:31,002
Your maiesty!

193
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,722
Who are you?

194
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,378
Who are you?

195
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:06,976
I am Raju, the masseur.

196
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,966
- Are you a masseur or a polisher?
- Yes? - Yes!

197
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:13,349
Your fingers should
work like you're..

198
00:22:13,613 --> 00:22:15,209
Playing a piano while massaging.

199
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,207
Come on, play it.

200
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,918
- I don't know how to play a piano.
- You don't know?

201
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:20,611
It doesn't matter.

202
00:22:20,721 --> 00:22:22,710
I will play your piano.

203
00:22:22,854 --> 00:22:23,884
You will play it?

204
00:22:23,924 --> 00:22:27,048
What else? Will my late
father play it?

205
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:33,791
- Remove it.
- Yes? - Undress.

206
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,757
Don't move! Don't move!

207
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,577
It's tickling me.

208
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:58,608
Please don't play my piano
more, your majesty.

209
00:24:20,257 --> 00:24:24,230
Hey, where are you going?
You will here from today.

210
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:28,547
- Yes?
- Yes, I have laughed for the first time in my life.

211
00:24:28,651 --> 00:24:30,842
I am very happy with you.
In lieu of this..

212
00:24:30,882 --> 00:24:32,803
I am willing to fulfill
any of your desires.

213
00:24:33,796 --> 00:24:36,249
Will you fulfill my desires?

214
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:39,046
The family of Raghus have
this legacy they may..

215
00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:41,778
Sacrifice their life,
but not break their promise. Ask.

216
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:47,937
Please make me a king.

217
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:50,686
You want to become a king.
I will make you one.

218
00:24:52,146 --> 00:24:54,778
What did you say? You
wish to become a king?

219
00:24:55,067 --> 00:24:58,309
That isn't possible.
Kings are made..

220
00:24:58,349 --> 00:25:02,425
- Kings are born.
- So please borne me too.

221
00:25:03,847 --> 00:25:06,937
You asked me my wish, I told you.

222
00:25:07,597 --> 00:25:10,719
But what do you think? Kings
and emperors are happy?

223
00:25:10,931 --> 00:25:12,785
Never. Look at me.

224
00:25:13,286 --> 00:25:17,517
I have this palace, wealth,
servants, everything but..

225
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,521
But all this has no worth to you.

226
00:25:20,682 --> 00:25:23,586
Because you have all this but..

227
00:25:27,037 --> 00:25:29,211
It's uncle's trunk call
from Rathodgad.

228
00:25:29,284 --> 00:25:30,284
What does he want to say?

229
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:33,425
His grand daughter, the
princess Poonam who had..

230
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:35,433
Acted insolently with you he
is asking forgiveness for that.

231
00:25:35,457 --> 00:25:36,457
She is forgiven.

232
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:42,319
He wants to ask forgiveness
from you.

233
00:25:42,384 --> 00:25:43,576
Okay.

234
00:25:45,094 --> 00:25:47,042
Get up.. wait.. you go.

235
00:25:52,444 --> 00:25:54,715
Let God be merciful, uncle,
I am Pratap Singh here.

236
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:57,312
Let God be merciful.
I came to know..

237
00:25:57,352 --> 00:25:59,973
About your return from Tokyo.
And Poonam told me..

238
00:26:00,013 --> 00:26:02,252
That you wrote her a letter
from Tokyo to Singapore.

239
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:04,309
And the letter that she wrote
to me as an answer..

240
00:26:04,384 --> 00:26:06,591
If she'd written it to you,
you'd die of shame.

241
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,045
I know, son.

242
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:12,643
But the two of you never
met each other.

243
00:26:12,782 --> 00:26:14,411
And I don't want to meet him too.

244
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:16,701
I am not interested in meeting her.

245
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:21,046
I don't want that the decision
made by the elders..

246
00:26:21,086 --> 00:26:23,584
Should be undone because
of your differences.

247
00:26:23,988 --> 00:26:27,810
- I want you to be married now.
- But I..

248
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,100
Listen.. Poonam is mature now.

249
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,449
- And the Prince of Arzpur..
- Has sent a proposal.

250
00:26:33,936 --> 00:26:35,891
Uncle, you just accept his proposal.

251
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:38,131
That insolent girl won't get
another proposal like this.

252
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,070
I wish..

253
00:26:41,478 --> 00:26:43,643
Poonam and you to meet each other..

254
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,395
And stay together for some days.

255
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:46,659
You will understand each other.

256
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:48,726
Maybe the bitterness between
you two will fade away.

257
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,711
- See..
- This is my order.

258
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:52,694
Reach the Oberoi, Srinagar on..

259
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:54,094
The evening of the first
of this coming month.

260
00:26:54,118 --> 00:26:55,333
Poonam will meet you there.

261
00:26:55,373 --> 00:26:56,376
May God be merciful!

262
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,199
Did you see that?

263
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:05,211
The kings and emperors have
to marry on orders too.

264
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:07,583
But I won't let this happen.

265
00:27:07,937 --> 00:27:10,311
I will avenge this
insult with insult.

266
00:27:20,938 --> 00:27:21,938
Listen..

267
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,278
- You want to become a king, isn't it?
- Yes.

268
00:27:24,318 --> 00:27:25,638
I will make you a king.

269
00:27:28,218 --> 00:27:30,209
- You will make me one.
- Surely.

270
00:27:30,421 --> 00:27:32,166
I will train you.

271
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:34,077
And I will send you to Kashmir..

272
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:36,032
As the Prince Pratap
Singh from Chandinagar.

273
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:38,048
- Are you telling the truth?
- Yes.

274
00:27:38,203 --> 00:27:42,419
- I will introduce you to Princess Poonam there.
- You will?

275
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:45,051
Yes. And do you what
you have to do there?

276
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:48,506
Yes. I will fold my hands,
bow my head..

277
00:27:48,546 --> 00:27:50,435
And thank her for meeting me.

278
00:27:50,475 --> 00:27:52,978
No! You won't do anything like that.

279
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:58,239
You will insult her just like how
she insulted me in the letter.

280
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,687
But, your maiesty..

281
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:03,772
How can a poor orphan like
me insult a princess?

282
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:05,875
You won't be a poor
orphan at that time.

283
00:28:05,915 --> 00:28:07,426
You will be His Maiesty
at that time.

284
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:09,248
Your wallet will be full of money.

285
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:10,851
You will have wonderful clothes.

286
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:13,669
You will have exquisite
cars and hero like hair.

287
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:28,918
Your maiesty..

288
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,244
Please look at this for a moment.

289
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:33,636
I am seeing.

290
00:31:33,677 --> 00:31:35,856
Not me, sir. Here.

291
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,719
- Who is this?
- Recognize him.

292
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:49,455
What a change!

293
00:31:56,145 --> 00:31:56,758
Yes, sir..

294
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:59,244
We will go to Srinagar with
Raju tomorrow morning.

295
00:31:59,284 --> 00:31:59,739
Very good, sir.

296
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:02,839
- Arrange for two seats in an aeroplane.
- Yes, sir.

297
00:32:42,025 --> 00:32:43,746
See, the princess will be coming.

298
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:46,375
I am sure, when she sees you.
She will think you to be..

299
00:32:46,718 --> 00:32:51,249
The prince, ask forgivness
and tell you..

300
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:55,012
'Sorry, I didn't think while
writing that letter to you ♪

301
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:56,273

00:32:56,313 --> 00:32:59,741
Letter? Which letter? I
didn't get any letter.

303
00:32:59,975 --> 00:33:01,552
And even if I would
have got any letter..

304
00:33:01,576 --> 00:33:04,150
I must have thrown it into the
rubbish bin without reading it.

305
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,854
Is it okay?
Come on, tell me.

But, when will I tell her all this?

317
00:33:43,182 --> 00:33:45,734
As soon as she arrives,
in the launch.

318
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:48,117
Then, shall we move? She
must he arriving now.

I won't.. I mean you won't be..

There for her welcome,
but that cartoon prince.

322
00:34:01,177 --> 00:34:02,077
The prince?

323
00:34:02,117 --> 00:34:04,869
Yes, he is the prince
of a poor state.

324
00:34:04,991 --> 00:34:07,575
He wishes to marry the princess
and become rich.

325
00:34:07,773 --> 00:34:09,361
And he has come here
for that reason.

326

Please come.

327
00:34:26,175 --> 00:34:28,242

Letter? What letter?
I didn't get any letter..

329
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:34,704
Not now. You have to say
it when she comes.

00:34:35,505 --> 00:34:38,685
- Here, she comes.
- Letter, what letter?

331
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:55,308
Your Maiesty, Pratapsingh
of Chandigarh.

332
00:34:55,414 --> 00:34:57,849
Her Maiesty Poonamdevi
of Rathoregarh.

333
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,684
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

334
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:05,241
Please have a seat.

335
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:11,048
You have a seat too.

336
00:35:11,088 --> 00:35:14,425
- Oh, I am standing still.
- Have a seat.

337
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,022
I never met you before this.

338
00:35:18,623 --> 00:35:21,818
But I think that I have
seen you somewhere.

339
00:35:22,176 --> 00:35:23,885
Yes? My face..

340
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:26,618
Your maiesty, actually..

341
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:30,250
His maiesty's face is similar to
the film actor Shashi Kapoor.

342
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:32,746
It is possible that you
saw some old film of his.

343
00:35:36,414 --> 00:35:38,792
When did you come back from foreign?

344
00:35:39,444 --> 00:35:41,297
Letter? What letter? I
didn't get any letter.

345
00:35:41,337 --> 00:35:43,764
And even if I did get it, I
threw it in the rubbish bin.

346
00:35:46,782 --> 00:35:48,491
Which letter are you talking about?

347
00:35:48,531 --> 00:35:50,255
Letter? What letter?
I didn't get any letter.

348
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:52,479
And even if I did get it, I
threw it in the rubbish bin.

349
00:35:59,543 --> 00:36:01,079
What are you staring at?

350
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:07,205
I am seeing how beautiful you are.

351
00:36:07,975 --> 00:36:09,741
Letter? What letter?
I didn't get any letter.

352
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:11,981
And even if I did get it,
I threw it in the rubbish bin.

353
00:36:15,283 --> 00:36:17,245
All your luggage has
been settled, Poonam.

354
00:36:18,155 --> 00:36:20,535
Your maiesty, His maiesty..

355
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,715
It seems that I have
seen you earlier.

356
00:36:24,755 --> 00:36:26,239
We have met earlier.

357
00:36:26,342 --> 00:36:28,072
Even I used to think the same.

358
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,599
But his face is similar to the
film actor Shashi Kapoor.

359
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,177
I had seen a movie of his.

360
00:36:35,636 --> 00:36:36,739
What was it's name?

361
00:36:39,207 --> 00:36:42,247
You are forgetting it, you
must have seen Hunterwalli.

362
00:36:42,626 --> 00:36:45,345
It is a 'walli', isn't it?

363
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,653
Letter? What letter?
I didn't get any letter.

364
00:36:50,693 --> 00:36:53,680
And if I did get one, I threw it in
the rubbish bin without reading.

365
00:36:54,377 --> 00:36:56,728
Come on!

366
00:36:58,774 --> 00:37:02,374
I clenched my teeth in anger.
I winked from above..

367
00:37:02,546 --> 00:37:05,745
I kicked from below.
But you smiled..

368
00:37:05,785 --> 00:37:07,374
And just stared at that Poonam!

369
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:09,166
Did I bring you to Kashmir for this?

370
00:37:09,206 --> 00:37:11,531
But your maiesty, it is
the same princess..

371
00:37:11,571 --> 00:37:13,577
Whether she is the same
or someone else..

372
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:16,241
Remember, if you don't insult her..

373
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:19,787
At tonight's party,
you will have to pay..

374
00:37:19,827 --> 00:37:22,247
For your traveling,
boarding and food.

375
00:37:22,804 --> 00:37:25,913
But, I won't be able to pay you
for that throughout my life.

376
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,567
Okay, your maiesty.

377
00:37:28,607 --> 00:37:30,606
Tell me what I have to tell her.

378
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:32,865
I will tell it to her
face right away.

379
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:34,239
Very good.

380
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:36,642
Then you tell her in
everyone's presence.

381
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:41,374
That she is ugly. She is fat.
She is cross-eyed.

382
00:37:41,414 --> 00:37:42,745
She has a flat nose.

383
00:37:42,814 --> 00:37:45,908
But this is false.
She is very beautiful.

384
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,797
Whether she is beautiful
or some maiden.

385
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:51,774
- You will say what I told you to.
- Yes.

386
00:37:52,296 --> 00:37:54,749
And listen. I will be
standing ahead of you.

387
00:37:55,283 --> 00:37:58,726
I will be standing afar
and telling you..

388
00:37:58,766 --> 00:38:01,036
When you have to smile,
laugh and show your teeth.

389
00:38:01,076 --> 00:38:04,182
- And when you have to cry. Understood?
- Yes.

390
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:10,462
What I was saying was..

391
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:26,653
Okay.

392
00:38:27,352 --> 00:38:28,420
His maiesty..

393
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,852
His maiesty..

394
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:38,688
Listen, this is the chance
to insult her. Come on.

395
00:39:00,065 --> 00:39:02,485
I apologize, we were
late while arriving.

396
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:08,794
Please have one..

397
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:11,258
Actually, Poonam is telling
you, please take one.

398
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:20,438
That's strange.

399
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,386
You stayed in foreign countries
all your life but..

400
00:39:23,426 --> 00:39:26,450
The director told us to stay
away from intoxication.

401
00:39:26,549 --> 00:39:27,822
The director..

402
00:39:28,149 --> 00:39:29,309
The director?

403
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,306
He was speaking about my father.

404
00:39:32,382 --> 00:39:33,974
His name was Sanchalak Singh.

405
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:36,483
He used to travel with him
in foreign countries.

406
00:39:41,269 --> 00:39:44,172
Please come, we shall
have our dinner.

407
00:39:50,643 --> 00:39:52,291
Bring a large one for His Maiesty.

408
00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:04,972
Your Maiesty..

409
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:09,165
I am speaking to you.

410
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:12,982
A special drink for you.

411
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:25,808
Thank you.

412
00:40:29,015 --> 00:40:30,310
So, I was telling you..

413
00:40:30,572 --> 00:40:33,802
5th May always brings
something in my life.

414
00:40:34,276 --> 00:40:36,419
Either something good,
or something bad.

415
00:40:36,459 --> 00:40:39,539
- Like?
- Like I was born on 5th May.

416
00:40:40,055 --> 00:40:41,981
It is so sad. It is so sad!

417
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:50,876
And the day when I got the news..

418
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,095
Of winning the derby,
the date was 5th May.

419
00:40:54,688 --> 00:40:58,308
I sympathise with you, princess,
I really do.

420
00:41:04,498 --> 00:41:09,648
And my parents expired in the
air crash on the 5th of May.

421
00:41:12,765 --> 00:41:13,975
Is it so?

422
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,832
What letter? I didn't
get any letter.

423
00:41:28,872 --> 00:41:31,539
Even if I did get it, I threw
it in the rubbish bin..

424
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:33,136
Letter.. letter.. letter..

425
00:41:33,598 --> 00:41:34,598
Your Maiesty..

426
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:49,275
Let it be morning.

427
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,025
I will teach you such a lesson.

428
00:41:51,065 --> 00:41:52,988
You will never forget it
throughout your life.

429
00:41:54,285 --> 00:41:55,309
The keys..

430
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,691
Stand straight.

431
00:42:00,356 --> 00:42:02,326
I will get the keys right away.

432
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:51,346
"There was a male bird
and a female bird."

433
00:42:53,582 --> 00:42:57,908
"There was a male bird
and a female bird."

434
00:42:58,036 --> 00:43:02,806
"Both of them existed
in the garden."

435
00:43:17,201 --> 00:43:24,694
"Didn't know why the bird
used to shy like this."

436
00:43:24,734 --> 00:43:27,249
"What did he know.."

437
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,976
Who is it?

438
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:40,984
Who is it?

439
00:43:43,209 --> 00:43:44,246
His maiesty?

440
00:43:45,678 --> 00:43:48,978
Princess? You here?
So late in the night?

441
00:43:49,781 --> 00:43:50,558
What will the people say?

442
00:43:50,598 --> 00:43:52,965
What are you doing here?
This is my room!

443
00:43:53,261 --> 00:43:54,142
Go away from here.

444
00:43:54,182 --> 00:43:55,433
- This is your room?
- Yes!

445
00:43:55,474 --> 00:43:58,225
- I thought that it was my room!
- It's my room, go away!

446
00:44:05,386 --> 00:44:08,535
Thief, catch him! Catch him!

447
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:12,624
Where is he? Where is he?

448
00:44:13,643 --> 00:44:15,380
The thief has run away.

449
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,980
Why did he run away?

450
00:44:17,149 --> 00:44:19,357
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

451
00:44:19,397 --> 00:44:20,708
Go, and catch him.

452
00:44:20,748 --> 00:44:22,042
Bring him and tie him to the wall.

453
00:44:22,066 --> 00:44:23,757
I will shoot him!

454
00:44:25,433 --> 00:44:28,145
- It's surely that thief's..
- Yes, it must be the thief's..

455
00:44:30,661 --> 00:44:33,249
But why will the thief steal
removing his clothes?

456
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:34,622
I am sorry.

457
00:44:34,763 --> 00:44:36,674
This suit doesn't belong
to the thief.

458
00:44:41,249 --> 00:44:43,831
It belongs to his maiesty.
He left it here in haste.

459
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,120
Your gown.

460
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:56,352
It doesn't matter. It does happen.

461
00:45:10,661 --> 00:45:14,312
Get up. Get up!

462
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:18,515
Let me congratulate you!
Get up! Get up!

463
00:45:18,728 --> 00:45:21,367
I just made you his Maiesty.

464
00:45:21,407 --> 00:45:23,479
But you turned out to be the best.

465
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:26,998
You insulted the princess
in such a way..

466
00:45:27,114 --> 00:45:29,275
That she will keep weeping
all through her life.

467
00:45:29,399 --> 00:45:32,155
I insulted her?

468
00:45:32,303 --> 00:45:35,739
- Did you forget it? You were in her bed yesterday.
- Yes!

469
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,901
And when I went to
take your clothes..

470
00:45:37,941 --> 00:45:41,365
And return her gown,
please don't ask!

471
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,496
She was in a proper state
due to embarrassment.

472
00:45:54,884 --> 00:45:59,218
It seems that she hasn't come for
her morning walk in the garden.

473
00:46:02,202 --> 00:46:06,272
She isn't to be seen anywhere,
not by a yard.

474
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:08,711
Hey, who is this?

475
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:12,767
Is it the princess?

476
00:46:12,807 --> 00:46:16,314
It is not your princess,
it my heart's princess.

477
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:21,835
That same face, that same height.

478
00:46:21,931 --> 00:46:25,762
That twirling movement, which I
searched for in Bangkok and Hong Kong..

479
00:46:25,802 --> 00:46:30,525
Here, take this and you look too.

480
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:43,044
I insulted the princess? I did?

481
00:46:53,717 --> 00:46:59,049
Princess, I am very sorry about
yesterday night's incident.

482
00:46:59,236 --> 00:47:01,711
I don't want to hear anything
about yesterday night.

483
00:47:16,884 --> 00:47:17,884
What is it?

484
00:47:18,117 --> 00:47:19,709
Ask me what it isn't.

485
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:23,213
The king of Chandinagar is
standing in your presence.

486
00:47:23,468 --> 00:47:25,070
My bud of Kashmir!

487
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:29,046
My sweet! I will sacrifice the
wealth of the world to you.

488
00:47:29,117 --> 00:47:31,058
I will make myself a garland
around your neck.

489
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,927
Keep your hands to yourself
or I will slap you.

490
00:47:35,114 --> 00:47:36,424
Oh!

491
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,718
What about a slap, my beloved?

492
00:47:38,758 --> 00:47:40,715
My Kashmiri carpet..

493
00:47:40,755 --> 00:47:44,042
Even if you take my heart
away, I won't die.

494
00:47:44,117 --> 00:47:46,377
We lovers are immortal!

495
00:47:46,417 --> 00:47:47,700
Get aside.

496
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:51,010
If my father knows this,
he will kill you.

497
00:47:51,518 --> 00:47:55,040
Father, do you mean my
to be father-in-law..

498
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,975
I am telling you, it is better
if you go away now.

499
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:57,730
Otherwise my father..

500
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:00,782
Father! Is your father
some God of death?

501
00:48:10,575 --> 00:48:11,870
What did you say?

502
00:48:28,154 --> 00:48:29,243
Please listen.

503
00:48:34,672 --> 00:48:35,720
Please..

504
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,141
I don't want to hear anything.

505
00:48:38,189 --> 00:48:39,809
Just look at me once.

506
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:42,715
You will see what
an honest man I am.

507
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:45,989
I understood your sincerity
last night.

508
00:48:47,158 --> 00:48:49,238
Please forget yesterday
night, princess.

509
00:48:49,278 --> 00:48:52,928
For yesterday night's meeting,
for everything.

510
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:17,707
"For yesterday night's meeting,
for everything."

511
00:49:18,006 --> 00:49:21,830
"Please forgive me."

512
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:25,635
"Please forgive me."

513
00:49:25,675 --> 00:49:31,383
"For yesterday night's meeting,
for everything."

514
00:49:31,423 --> 00:49:35,041
"Please forgive me."

515
00:49:35,259 --> 00:49:38,960
"Please forgive me."

516
00:50:02,185 --> 00:50:06,072
"Don't look at the mirror,
look at my face."

517
00:50:06,112 --> 00:50:09,943
"See my simple character and form."

518
00:50:13,645 --> 00:50:17,461
"Am I not a honest and sincere man?"

519
00:50:17,501 --> 00:50:21,330
"Am I not praiseworthy?"

520
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:25,031
"You give me iustice now!"

521
00:50:25,072 --> 00:50:28,778
"You give me iustice now!"

522
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:32,511
"Please forgive me."

523
00:50:32,551 --> 00:50:36,371
"Please forgive me."

524
00:50:55,442 --> 00:50:59,406
"How can I dare to touch you?"

525
00:50:59,446 --> 00:51:03,446
"How can I take your name?"

526
00:51:07,005 --> 00:51:14,519
"That moth, happy go lucky
person was someone else."

527
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,326
"Please accept this
clean hearted one."

528
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:22,110
"Please listen to me, this
is my first mistake."

529
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:25,863
"Please forgive me."

530
00:51:25,903 --> 00:51:29,848
"Please forgive me."

531
00:51:52,461 --> 00:52:00,461
"It is accepted that the first
mistake is always forgiven."

532
00:52:03,971 --> 00:52:07,703
"If you won't be merciful on me.."

533
00:52:07,743 --> 00:52:11,529
"The world will call you
heartless and a torturer."

534
00:52:11,569 --> 00:52:15,297
"What else should I say?
Please forgive me."

535
00:52:15,337 --> 00:52:18,989
"What else should I say?
Please forgive me."

536
00:52:19,029 --> 00:52:22,736
"Please forgive me."

537
00:52:22,776 --> 00:52:26,421
"Please forgive me."

538
00:52:26,461 --> 00:52:32,053
"For yesterday night's meeting,
for everything."

539
00:52:32,093 --> 00:52:35,806
"Please forgive me."

540
00:52:35,961 --> 00:52:39,901
"Please forgive me."

541
00:52:57,893 --> 00:52:59,224
Why not?

542
00:52:59,498 --> 00:53:01,557
Why can't you insult her?

543
00:53:02,601 --> 00:53:04,559
When a person loves someone..

544
00:53:05,028 --> 00:53:08,962
- He respects her, he doesn't insult her.
- What?

545
00:53:10,254 --> 00:53:13,552
I think that I fell
in love with her..

546
00:53:13,885 --> 00:53:16,890
When I saw her for the first time.

547
00:53:19,423 --> 00:53:22,848
Your maiesty, I am grateful to you.

548
00:53:23,893 --> 00:53:25,554
You may even kill me if you so wish.

549
00:53:26,653 --> 00:53:30,891
But please don't ell me to say
anything against the princess.

550
00:53:31,893 --> 00:53:36,057
I won't be able to do that.
I won't be able to hurt her.

551
00:53:41,831 --> 00:53:43,558
You have taught me to smile.

552
00:53:44,156 --> 00:53:49,109
You think that I like seeing
tears in your eyes? No.

553
00:53:49,712 --> 00:53:52,674
I promise you, Poonam will be yours.

554
00:53:56,893 --> 00:53:57,893
But..

555
00:53:59,335 --> 00:54:04,744
She is a princess..
And I am an orphan.

556
00:54:05,497 --> 00:54:09,145
If love can be weighed against
gold and silver..

557
00:54:09,457 --> 00:54:10,924
Would that be termed as love?

558
00:54:10,964 --> 00:54:11,964
Listen..

559
00:54:12,099 --> 00:54:14,170
The princess hasn't forgiven
you till now, isn't it?

560
00:54:14,441 --> 00:54:15,205
No.

561
00:54:15,449 --> 00:54:18,465
But she has invited the Kunwar
for the party tonight.

562
00:54:18,768 --> 00:54:19,687
Doesn't matter.

563
00:54:19,727 --> 00:54:21,749
Do as I tell you.

564
00:54:22,118 --> 00:54:23,006
You'll see..

565
00:54:23,046 --> 00:54:25,759
Not the Kunwar, but his Maiesty..

566
00:54:25,799 --> 00:54:27,681
Will be with Poonam
at tonight's party.

567
00:54:27,721 --> 00:54:29,554
Move, come on, come.

568
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:34,988
Think that I have won
half the battle.

569
00:54:35,419 --> 00:54:39,962
The rest of war, I will
win at tonight's party.

570
00:54:40,002 --> 00:54:43,997
But sir, I think that she
is fooling both of you.

571
00:54:44,037 --> 00:54:44,578
What?

572
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:48,816
I mean that she is trying
to fool the two of you.

573
00:54:51,382 --> 00:54:52,386
She loves me..

574
00:54:53,235 --> 00:54:55,624
See? It's her call already.

575
00:55:04,317 --> 00:55:12,317
May God be merciful, Sir,
I am His majesty here.

576
00:55:13,115 --> 00:55:14,262
Yes, tell me.

577
00:55:14,816 --> 00:55:17,252
- That ADC of mine..
- Yes?

578
00:55:17,387 --> 00:55:19,561
He has left my employ and ran away.

579
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:23,891
If he does come to you, don't
believe in anything that he says.

580
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,883
No, I won't speak to him.

581
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:34,011
- His ADC ran away from him.
- Why?

582
00:55:34,127 --> 00:55:36,257
He must not have paid him,
don't talk rubbish.

583
00:55:36,353 --> 00:55:39,681
That King isn't like me,
who can't pay his ADC.

584
00:55:39,721 --> 00:55:40,721
Right.

585
00:55:42,727 --> 00:55:44,558
Surely, there is something else.

586
00:55:47,388 --> 00:55:48,686
May God be merciful.

587
00:55:51,676 --> 00:55:52,676
Oh.

588
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:03,421
- Oh sir, this worthless man has a request.
- Tell me.

589
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:05,440
Please keep me as your ADC.

590
00:56:06,394 --> 00:56:09,690
Please keep as an ADC to your ADC.

591
00:56:10,491 --> 00:56:11,513
Tell me..

592
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:13,989
Why did the king remove you?

593
00:56:14,029 --> 00:56:16,749
He didn't remove me,
I resigned myself.

594
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,151
He wishes me to be a wall between
you and the princess.

595
00:56:21,474 --> 00:56:22,543
- A wall?
- Yes.

596
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:25,890
The princess that she has seen
the Chinese from China.

597
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:28,660
The Japanese from Japan and
the Africans from Africa.

598
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,281
She even saw the English
from England.

599
00:56:30,321 --> 00:56:34,490
But she never saw a braver
and younger man than you.

600
00:56:37,035 --> 00:56:39,991
Her maiesty, when you
dislike the Kunwar..

601
00:56:40,236 --> 00:56:42,490
Why did you invite him
to the party tonight?

602
00:56:42,951 --> 00:56:45,118
So that his maiesty gets
jealous and goes away.

603
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:47,522
Why don't you tell him
everything clearly?

604
00:56:47,784 --> 00:56:49,446
If I do tell him everything
clearly..

605
00:56:49,486 --> 00:56:52,991
- Uncle will kill me. Understood?
- Yes.

606
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:56,169
Her maiesty..

607
00:57:00,635 --> 00:57:01,635
Tell me?

608
00:57:04,948 --> 00:57:07,399
The person who apologizes
after committing a mistake.

609
00:57:07,587 --> 00:57:09,319
He is considered to be a great man.

610
00:57:09,391 --> 00:57:12,788
But the man who forgives him
is considered greater.

611
00:57:13,527 --> 00:57:20,075
If you accept these flowers,
I'll think that you forgave me.

612
00:57:28,856 --> 00:57:30,573
Why don't you people have a seat?

613
00:57:32,046 --> 00:57:33,046
Please come..

614
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:35,985
And the princess further says that..

615
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:38,699
Eating home cooked rural food..

616
00:57:38,739 --> 00:57:42,600
You have such a
glow on your face..

617
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:44,844
She is burning due to that glow.

618
00:57:46,512 --> 00:57:51,600
But I have never eaten
whatever you just said.

619
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,450
Your father must surely
have eaten it.

620
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:54,870
I have seen it with my own eyes.

621
00:57:58,488 --> 00:58:00,583
But what does this
king want from you?

622
00:58:00,623 --> 00:58:03,652
He wants me to separate
the two of you?

623
00:58:03,724 --> 00:58:05,581
Yes. And do you know?

624
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:07,732
He has arranged for a
fancy dress show in..

625
00:58:07,773 --> 00:58:11,288
The party tonight. He has
called everyone in it.

626
00:58:11,381 --> 00:58:13,627
- Except you.
- I don't have time.

627
00:58:13,743 --> 00:58:16,407
- I am going to the party tonight.
- I know that, sir.

628
00:58:16,604 --> 00:58:18,649
But the show is before the party.

629
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:20,988
And the princess is
invited in that too.

630
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:23,817
And do you know further?

631
00:58:23,857 --> 00:58:25,495
This is the king's trick.

632
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:35,442
I understood.

633
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:44,985
Please have it.

634
00:58:46,963 --> 00:58:49,491
That's what I had come to tell you.

635
00:58:49,558 --> 00:58:51,992
The princess is going there
as Princess Subhadra.

636
00:58:53,324 --> 00:58:58,660
If you listen to me, become
Arjun and reach her room.

637
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:02,485
And just like Ariun had
eloped with Subhadra.

638
00:59:02,794 --> 00:59:05,340
You elope with Poonam too.

639
00:59:05,787 --> 00:59:07,783
And I can tell you surely,
you will..

640
00:59:07,823 --> 00:59:10,760
Get the first, second and
third and the last prize.

641
00:59:12,696 --> 00:59:15,118
But where will I get
Arjun's uniform?

642
00:59:15,158 --> 00:59:18,491
Uniform? There is no dearth
of uniforms in this cold.

643
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:21,038
There are so many iobless
drama companies.

644
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:22,578
You dial just one number.

645
00:59:22,618 --> 00:59:24,988
You will get the uniforms
of the whole Mahabharata.

646
00:59:25,636 --> 00:59:27,986
I will dial it right away now..

647
00:59:28,224 --> 00:59:29,500
You are such a good man..

648
00:59:34,801 --> 00:59:35,985
The soul..

649
00:59:37,236 --> 00:59:38,989
I forgot to place
my hand on myheart.

650
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:43,282
My soul is yearning. Subhadra,
the heart is not at peace.

651
00:59:43,322 --> 00:59:46,715
Come beloved, let us go
where there is privacy.

652
00:59:47,082 --> 00:59:48,098
What insolence is this?

653
00:59:49,651 --> 00:59:52,907
I knew that my Subhadra
will be shy of people..

654
00:59:52,947 --> 00:59:55,343
And society, she'll be scared
and not come to me.

655
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:58,432
But I will take her on my shoulders.

656
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,491
Don't call me Kunwar, call
me the son of Kunti, Arjun.

657
01:00:04,031 --> 01:00:05,412
Please go away.

658
01:00:06,496 --> 01:00:10,765
No! Not liquor, the elixir of gods!

659
01:00:25,074 --> 01:00:27,991
I haven't seen an insolent
or shameless man than you.

660
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:31,726
But all this was done
by his Majesty's ADC.

661
01:00:31,766 --> 01:00:36,991
I had told you not to pay attention
to anything he says.

662
01:00:38,158 --> 01:00:39,989
Where is he? Where is he?

663
01:00:43,158 --> 01:00:45,205
Where are you running?

664
01:00:45,324 --> 01:00:48,157
You sinner, wretch!
You fooled Arjun!

665
01:00:48,224 --> 01:00:50,301
He will show you the mace now!

666
01:00:50,341 --> 01:00:52,010
Be ware!

667
01:00:57,683 --> 01:01:01,000
The arrow from Ariun's
bow is released.

668
01:01:05,512 --> 01:01:07,171
Where are you running?

669
01:01:09,568 --> 01:01:11,176
Save me!

670
01:01:13,388 --> 01:01:14,635
Are you inside?

671
01:01:21,031 --> 01:01:23,102
Come on! Come out!

672
01:01:23,355 --> 01:01:28,406
- Remove the wretch out, or else I will force you!
- What?

673
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,396
You haven't seen Ariun's mace!

674
01:01:32,436 --> 01:01:33,989
And you haven't seen my axe!

675
01:01:34,029 --> 01:01:37,290
No axe works in front
of Arjun's mace.

676
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:42,253
Iniustice! Iniustice!

677
01:01:51,251 --> 01:01:53,339
You were to go to the partyy.

678
01:01:53,511 --> 01:01:55,299
Not were, I am, going.

679
01:01:57,496 --> 01:01:58,989
Come on, your maiesty.

680
01:02:10,988 --> 01:02:12,337
Your maiesty..

681
01:02:17,124 --> 01:02:18,631
Were you dreaming?

682
01:02:21,923 --> 01:02:25,549
- Can I ask you something?
- Please do.

683
01:02:26,704 --> 01:02:28,853
Did you see dreams too, ever?

684
01:02:28,893 --> 01:02:30,756
Yes, I did. In my childhood.

685
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:35,590
Were they fulfilled?

686
01:02:37,768 --> 01:02:41,259
Dreams are that which
can never be reality.

687
01:02:41,482 --> 01:02:42,578
Your maiesty..

688
01:02:44,792 --> 01:02:45,792
Yes.

689
01:02:53,484 --> 01:02:54,826
Did the Kunwar go?

690
01:02:54,866 --> 01:02:57,495
Yes. He drank one and a
half bottle of scotch.

691
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,979
He broke the outside window,
broke a waiter's head.

692
01:03:00,019 --> 01:03:01,588
And then left Kashmir.

693
01:03:02,137 --> 01:03:03,796
I am free of one now.

694
01:03:10,757 --> 01:03:13,445
Let me see.. But what should
I do of his majesty?

695
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:20,060
I will have to think something
to drive him away.

696
01:03:24,418 --> 01:03:27,887
You won't have to think something
to drive me away.

697
01:03:27,927 --> 01:03:30,151
- Your maiesty..
- You were right.

698
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:32,588
Dreams never turn into reality.

699
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:36,582
Then, how could my dream
turn into reality?

700
01:03:37,478 --> 01:03:40,662
If I did commit any mistake
knowingly or..

701
01:03:41,008 --> 01:03:42,918
Unknowingly please
forgive me for that.

702
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:35,717
The person who apologizes after
committing a mistake..

703
01:04:35,857 --> 01:04:37,588
He is thought to be a great man.

704
01:04:37,628 --> 01:04:40,819
But the man who forgives him
is thought to be greater.

705
01:04:43,757 --> 01:04:45,247
You were right.

706
01:04:45,755 --> 01:04:47,717
Dreams are never turned
into reality.

707
01:04:48,325 --> 01:04:51,591
Then, how can my dreams come true?

708
01:04:52,586 --> 01:04:55,590
If I committed any
mistake knowingly..

709
01:04:56,174 --> 01:04:57,974
Or unknowingly, please
forgive me for that.

710
01:06:18,552 --> 01:06:21,043
I will push, you start the car.

711
01:06:21,505 --> 01:06:22,793
Maybe, it will get out.

712
01:06:23,685 --> 01:06:27,457
I am sorry for yesterday
night's incident.

713
01:06:28,972 --> 01:06:30,918
I thought about it all
through the night.

714
01:06:32,757 --> 01:06:34,775
Yes, even I couldn't sleep at night.

715
01:06:35,864 --> 01:06:37,784
I'd made a call to your
place in the morning too.

716
01:06:38,267 --> 01:06:40,251
Yes, it was me who received it.

717
01:06:41,319 --> 01:06:44,586
But, I was told that
you were sleeping.

718
01:06:45,366 --> 01:06:46,366
Yes..

719
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:47,570
Yes.

720
01:06:48,873 --> 01:06:52,090
I was sleeping at that time.
I am awake now.

721
01:06:54,061 --> 01:06:55,813
Take God's name and turn the key.

722
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:57,914
The car will clear in
one single thrust.

723
01:07:45,918 --> 01:07:47,483
Are you hurt?

724
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:49,434
I am all right, princess.

725
01:07:56,867 --> 01:07:58,283
You were being so careful of it.

726
01:07:58,323 --> 01:07:59,963
And it splattered all
over you in the end.

727
01:08:00,337 --> 01:08:01,924
- Who?
- The muck.

728
01:08:06,134 --> 01:08:07,614
What will happen now?

729
01:08:07,815 --> 01:08:09,100
What will happen.

730
01:08:09,331 --> 01:08:11,717
The one who made the muck has
made water to wash it to.

731
01:08:12,101 --> 01:08:14,614
I will just make you dip once and
everything will be all right.

732
01:08:14,654 --> 01:08:15,774
Please come.

733
01:08:39,886 --> 01:08:43,621
The water is too cold. If I take
a dip I will have pneumonia.

734
01:08:43,801 --> 01:08:44,539
See.

735
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:47,509
The one who made the water
made the fire too.

736
01:08:47,549 --> 01:08:49,417
We will sit in it's presence for
some time, all will be all right.

737
01:08:49,441 --> 01:08:52,909
- No!
- See, do what I did.

738
01:09:05,951 --> 01:09:08,100
Do what I did now, come on.

739
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:45,611
- Your maiesty..
- Yes?

740
01:09:46,692 --> 01:09:47,911
Please say something.

741
01:09:51,245 --> 01:09:52,517
What can I tell.

742
01:09:53,528 --> 01:09:55,616
You are the one feeling the chill..

743
01:09:56,037 --> 01:09:57,951
And you have given me the blanket.

744
01:09:58,521 --> 01:10:00,165
- Here, please take this blanket.
- No!

745
01:10:02,892 --> 01:10:05,549
I am not that selfish.

746
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:07,054
Then take half of it.

747
01:10:09,845 --> 01:10:11,093
How can I do that?

748
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,034
Come here, please.

749
01:10:19,913 --> 01:10:21,002
Here..

750
01:10:22,252 --> 01:10:24,920
Not here, here..

751
01:10:59,436 --> 01:11:03,592
I feel how selfish I have been..

752
01:11:04,102 --> 01:11:07,960
You? No, not at all. You
were cold, isn't it?

753
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,617
You were feeling cold too.

754
01:11:13,564 --> 01:11:17,069
But I think that I thought only
about myself before this.

755
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,088
But you..

756
01:11:22,898 --> 01:11:26,807
But I will remember today, forever.

757
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:33,321
What all has happened this day.

758
01:11:33,841 --> 01:11:37,102
Your car sticking in the
mud, my pushing it.

759
01:11:37,142 --> 01:11:39,644
The car moving out, my
falling in the muck.

760
01:11:40,551 --> 01:11:42,305
You supporting me.

761
01:11:42,561 --> 01:11:44,657
Dipping in the cold water.

762
01:11:45,762 --> 01:11:48,235
Sitting in the embrace
of the warm fire.

763
01:11:48,394 --> 01:11:52,343
Hiding from each other
and yet, so close.

764
01:11:54,939 --> 01:11:58,069
Do you know why all
this happened today?

765
01:12:01,615 --> 01:12:02,476
Why?

766
01:12:02,516 --> 01:12:04,941
Because today is 5th May.

767
01:12:05,014 --> 01:12:10,178
And this day brings either
good or bad in your life.

768
01:12:17,297 --> 01:12:18,653
"My beloved."

769
01:12:28,265 --> 01:12:36,265
"From today, I name you this."

770
01:12:36,703 --> 01:12:44,703
"My love.. my love.. my
beloved, my beloved."

771
01:12:46,047 --> 01:12:53,766
"From today, I name you this."

772
01:12:55,032 --> 01:13:03,032
"You gave me a message of
love under this pretext."

773
01:13:03,369 --> 01:13:11,369
"My love.. my love.. my
beloved, my beloved."

774
01:13:30,609 --> 01:13:35,153
"Give me an answer of my message."

775
01:13:35,193 --> 01:13:39,762
"Why are you so silent?'"

776
01:13:39,802 --> 01:13:44,255
"Why are you so silent?'"

777
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:52,295
"I am shying today. While
telling you something."

778
01:13:57,879 --> 01:14:05,879
"I gave my eyes the
task of my lips."

779
01:14:06,961 --> 01:14:14,722
"You gave me a message of
love under this pretext."

780
01:14:15,424 --> 01:14:23,424
"My love.. my love.. my
beloved, my beloved."

781
01:14:42,827 --> 01:14:50,827
"While speaking, you have
started to love me too."

782
01:14:56,564 --> 01:15:04,564
"You have stolen my
sleep and peace."

783
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:18,138
"And you are accusing me silently."

784
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:27,306
"You gave me a message of
love under this pretext."

785
01:15:27,872 --> 01:15:35,872
"My love.. my love.. my
beloved, my beloved."

786
01:15:55,534 --> 01:16:03,534
"You made every ambition
of this heart restless."

787
01:16:09,175 --> 01:16:17,175
"Don't say this, say,
every story of this heart."

788
01:16:22,853 --> 01:16:30,547
"It gave a beautiful
result to this love."

789
01:16:32,053 --> 01:16:40,053
"You gave me a message of
love under this pretext."

790
01:16:40,667 --> 01:16:48,667
- "My love.. my love..
- My beloved, my beloved."

791
01:16:49,721 --> 01:16:57,721
"My love.. my love.. my
beloved, my beloved."

792
01:17:24,227 --> 01:17:27,465
Slowly, if father hears it..

793
01:17:27,508 --> 01:17:30,166
Why, is your father
cooking food inside?

794
01:17:30,207 --> 01:17:33,461
No. He is cutting wood over there.

795
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:37,013
Let him cut the wood,
I will cut him too.

796
01:17:39,162 --> 01:17:42,272
How did you come to know my name?

797
01:17:42,594 --> 01:17:44,782
I asked your name everywhere.

798
01:17:45,078 --> 01:17:47,448
I searched for you everywhere.

799
01:17:47,615 --> 01:17:50,777
I risked my life and came
from the Hotel Oberoi.

800
01:17:51,131 --> 01:17:53,050
I will make you my queen today.

801
01:17:53,765 --> 01:17:56,853
- Sir, can I ask you something?
- Ask.

802
01:17:57,285 --> 01:18:00,761
Are you really a King?

803
01:18:01,618 --> 01:18:04,468
- Do I seem to be..
- Slowly..

804
01:18:04,856 --> 01:18:06,792
You don't believe me? Come with me.

805
01:18:06,889 --> 01:18:08,947
I will show you who I am. Come on.

806
01:18:13,861 --> 01:18:15,149
Tell me.

807
01:18:16,114 --> 01:18:19,738
- Won't you be my queen Victoria?
- What?

808
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:24,634
- Won't you be the queen of my Chandipur?
- Yes.

809
01:18:25,346 --> 01:18:28,881
Won't you be the mother
of my children?

810
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:31,458
Yes.

811
01:18:32,275 --> 01:18:33,711
You are my cuckoo.

812
01:18:35,764 --> 01:18:39,877
You are the first girl
who said yes and yes.

813
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,948
No! No!

814
01:18:43,073 --> 01:18:44,728
Hey, what kind of a girl are you?

815
01:18:45,017 --> 01:18:46,779
You say yes and then you say no.

816
01:18:47,277 --> 01:18:50,187
Did you see some wild hog?

817
01:18:50,631 --> 01:18:52,453
You pig!

818
01:18:52,493 --> 01:18:55,317
Where are you going?!

819
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:04,716
Please, please sit down.

820
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:07,061
We will sit there.

821
01:20:21,223 --> 01:20:22,223
Your maiesty..

822
01:20:23,377 --> 01:20:25,208
Please don't call me by that name.

823
01:20:25,348 --> 01:20:27,709
But I don't like this
Pratap Singh name.

824
01:20:28,377 --> 01:20:29,377
Even I don't like it.

825
01:20:29,404 --> 01:20:31,210
Then, what should I address you as?

826
01:20:39,573 --> 01:20:43,223
Okay, Mr. Raju. Please tell
me something about kingdom.

827
01:20:46,998 --> 01:20:49,205
- My kingdom?
- Yes. Chandipur.

828
01:20:50,198 --> 01:20:52,208
Tell me, what must be
the population there?

829
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:56,937
It must be something like
the whole of India.

830
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:58,313
It shouldn't have been that much.

831
01:21:00,274 --> 01:21:03,003
I was thinking that I'd
visit there some day.

832
01:21:03,423 --> 01:21:05,270
How must be the weather there now?

833
01:21:05,625 --> 01:21:08,584
- The weather?
- It will not be better than Kashmir.

834
01:21:08,624 --> 01:21:11,211
I mean, we will have to wait here.

835
01:21:11,644 --> 01:21:13,534
Come on, let us go to the temple.

836
01:21:16,678 --> 01:21:19,507
Do you want me not to
come to your kingdom?

837
01:21:19,547 --> 01:21:23,778
- No, it is nothing like that.
- Then, what is it?

838
01:21:26,434 --> 01:21:30,206
Tell me the truth,
what is the matter?

839
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:32,996
Why don't you tell me?
Please tell me.

840
01:21:33,324 --> 01:21:34,954
Truth is beautiful!
Truth is beautiful!

841
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,458
It is good that you awoke.

842
01:24:13,797 --> 01:24:16,591
Yes, but I was late in getting up.

843
01:24:20,506 --> 01:24:24,370
I thought about visiting
the Dal lake tonight.

844
01:24:28,442 --> 01:24:30,208
I wish to tell you something.

845
01:24:30,436 --> 01:24:32,276
It seems that I wish to
tell you something too.

846
01:24:33,022 --> 01:24:34,208
Please come then..

847
01:25:00,798 --> 01:25:03,579
Your maiesty, why are you so
silent?

848
01:25:04,633 --> 01:25:06,204
Because I awoke you from sleep?

849
01:25:06,906 --> 01:25:10,301
No. That was very good.

850
01:25:11,147 --> 01:25:12,801
Why are you so glum then?

851
01:25:13,597 --> 01:25:15,580
You should be happy today too.

852
01:25:15,712 --> 01:25:18,944
Why? What is so special today?

853
01:25:20,539 --> 01:25:23,210
Not today. Uncle is coming tomorrow.

854
01:25:34,939 --> 01:25:36,104
Do you know?

855
01:25:36,629 --> 01:25:39,140
When I told him about you over..

856
01:25:39,603 --> 01:25:41,250
The trunk call he was very happy.

857
01:25:41,813 --> 01:25:43,306
What did you tell him about me?

858
01:25:45,599 --> 01:25:50,311
I told him that I liked
my Majesty a lot.

859
01:25:52,758 --> 01:25:54,208
When I have awakened..

860
01:25:55,105 --> 01:25:57,056
- Should I ask you something?
- Please do.

861
01:25:59,099 --> 01:26:02,206
- If I weren't a king..
- Why would you not be one?

862
01:26:02,636 --> 01:26:03,435
No..

863
01:26:03,595 --> 01:26:11,212
Think that I would be a poor
farmer a normal clerk..

864
01:26:11,377 --> 01:26:19,377
Or an orphan, would you talk
about me to your uncle?

865
01:26:22,453 --> 01:26:24,900
Because then, the two of
us would never have met.

866
01:26:25,112 --> 01:26:29,206
And if.. I remembered something.

867
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:33,210
On uncle's saying, we had
gone to an orphanage once.

868
01:26:34,095 --> 01:26:35,936
An orphan had hugged me there.

869
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:39,745
I felt like having him shot down.

870
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:46,205
What's funnier is that,
he looks similar to you.

871
01:26:47,575 --> 01:26:49,616
But so what if he looked similar?

872
01:26:51,094 --> 01:26:53,901
A person should be worth something
to fall in love.

873
01:26:55,009 --> 01:27:01,540
- Isn't it?
- Yes. But please tell me.

874
01:27:02,751 --> 01:27:06,370
What if that orphan would
fall in love with you?

875
01:27:07,395 --> 01:27:09,519
Maybe, he would be forced
to commit suicide.

876
01:27:18,871 --> 01:27:20,021
You know..

877
01:27:20,574 --> 01:27:22,904
You know that a man can't
exist only on love.

878
01:27:23,878 --> 01:27:30,232
Respect, dignity and wealth,
even that is needed, isn't it?

879
01:27:30,852 --> 01:27:32,359
I think you are right.

880
01:27:34,646 --> 01:27:36,225
But how are we concerned
with all this?

881
01:27:37,962 --> 01:27:39,375
How are we concerned with all this?

882
01:28:15,782 --> 01:28:16,936
Your Maiesty..

883
01:28:25,788 --> 01:28:26,788
Uncle..

884
01:28:33,261 --> 01:28:34,285
His Maiesty..

885
01:28:34,804 --> 01:28:37,054
If you are the king, who was he?

886
01:28:37,094 --> 01:28:41,414
He was an orphan, but he
dreamt of being a king.

887
01:28:41,576 --> 01:28:43,754
I took advantage of this madness.

888
01:28:44,143 --> 01:28:47,208
And I brought him here, so that I..

889
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:51,622
Could avenge the insult that
you gave me in that letter.

890
01:28:54,985 --> 01:28:55,985
But..

891
01:28:56,625 --> 01:28:58,341
He couldn't insult you.

892
01:28:58,804 --> 01:29:00,665
Because he fell in love with you.

893
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:05,051
But.. but why did he leave?

894
01:29:05,156 --> 01:29:08,286
Because he was afraid
that after you..

895
01:29:08,326 --> 01:29:10,286
Know the truth, he would
fall in his own eyes..

896
01:29:10,327 --> 01:29:12,764
After looking at the hatred
for him in your eyes.

897
01:29:12,804 --> 01:29:16,698
Before leaving, he told
me to tell the princess..

898
01:29:17,315 --> 01:29:21,015
That he was the same orphan
who'd embraced her once..

899
01:29:21,173 --> 01:29:24,268
And you'd felt like
shooting him down.

900
01:29:24,542 --> 01:29:26,965
He was a conman and in disguise.

901
01:29:27,131 --> 01:29:30,045
He wanted to achieve happiness
y fooling others.

902
01:29:30,218 --> 01:29:32,382
But, when he found out
about uncle arriving..

903
01:29:32,512 --> 01:29:34,322
He thought that leaving
was the best.

904
01:29:34,487 --> 01:29:39,384
He wanted you to hate him
and forget him forever.

905
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:41,170
But..

906
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:45,885
The truth is..

907
01:29:47,248 --> 01:29:51,973
His only fault is that
he was an orphan..

908
01:29:52,225 --> 01:29:54,695
And he fell in love
with a princess.

909
01:29:55,028 --> 01:29:57,563
Whether you can forget him or not..

910
01:29:57,603 --> 01:30:00,267
But please forgive
him for certain.

911
01:30:31,322 --> 01:30:38,785
"The happiness blooms
in the garden of luck."

912
01:30:38,826 --> 01:30:46,211
"The happiness blooms
in the garden of luck."

913
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:53,580
"Some people achieve happiness
by searching."

914
01:30:53,620 --> 01:31:00,740
"Some people achieve happiness
by searching."

915
01:31:00,877 --> 01:31:08,324
"But we search unknowingly."

916
01:31:08,365 --> 01:31:15,636
"But we search unknowingly."

917
01:31:15,676 --> 01:31:23,075
"We look for someone merciful."

918
01:31:23,115 --> 01:31:30,181
"We look for someone merciful."

919
01:31:30,222 --> 01:31:37,771
"The one who'd support us,
w search for that arch!"

920
01:31:37,810 --> 01:31:44,905
"The one who'd support us,
w search for that arch!"

921
01:31:45,164 --> 01:31:52,195
"We look for someone merciful."

922
01:31:52,470 --> 01:32:00,106
"We look for someone merciful."

923
01:33:29,951 --> 01:33:33,217
O beloved!

924
01:33:33,258 --> 01:33:37,679
Without you, o beloved!

925
01:33:38,298 --> 01:33:41,347
O beloved!

926
01:33:41,387 --> 01:33:45,429
Without you, o beloved!

927
01:33:46,358 --> 01:33:50,479
My heart burns, it misses you.

928
01:33:50,519 --> 01:33:54,336
Every flower, every path,
every house.

929
01:33:54,445 --> 01:33:57,213
O beloved!

930
01:33:57,253 --> 01:34:01,346
Without you, o beloved!

931
01:34:18,489 --> 01:34:22,557
My eyes have started yearning.

932
01:34:22,613 --> 01:34:26,422
They have started shedding
tears in your loss.

933
01:34:26,648 --> 01:34:30,549
My eyes have started yearning.

934
01:34:30,677 --> 01:34:34,645
They have started shedding
tears in your loss.

935
01:34:34,685 --> 01:34:38,845
They cry all through the night,
they cry with me.

936
01:34:38,885 --> 01:34:42,480
Every flower, every path,
every house.

937
01:34:42,723 --> 01:34:45,594
O beloved!

938
01:34:45,634 --> 01:34:49,628
Without you, o beloved!

939
01:34:50,838 --> 01:34:54,836
My heart burns, it misses you.

940
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:58,755
Every flower, every path,
every house.

941
01:34:58,795 --> 01:35:01,530
O beloved!

942
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:05,399
Without you, o beloved!

943
01:35:27,029 --> 01:35:30,822
The shadows of your memories
are scattered.

944
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:34,823
The clouds of your dreams
are being settled.

945
01:35:35,074 --> 01:35:39,021
The shadows of your memories
are scattered.

946
01:35:39,061 --> 01:35:42,712
The clouds of your dreams
are being settled.

947
01:35:43,036 --> 01:35:45,198
Where should I go,
me the crazy girl?

948
01:35:45,238 --> 01:35:50,758
Everywhere, people are
talking about you.

949
01:35:51,002 --> 01:35:53,931
O beloved!

950
01:35:53,971 --> 01:35:57,640
Without you, o beloved!

951
01:35:59,113 --> 01:36:03,156
My heart burns, it misses you.

952
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:07,007
Every flower, every path,
every house.

953
01:36:07,117 --> 01:36:09,782
O beloved!

954
01:36:09,822 --> 01:36:13,371
Without you, o beloved!

955
01:36:31,111 --> 01:36:35,089
I won't come, you
came to know that.

956
01:36:35,129 --> 01:36:38,997
I won't leave this whole world.

957
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:43,033
I won't come, you
came to know that.

958
01:36:43,073 --> 01:36:46,845
I won't leave this whole world.

959
01:36:47,043 --> 01:36:49,012
You didn't see me and call me.

960
01:36:49,052 --> 01:36:51,186
I would have walked away
to you, kicking.

961
01:36:51,226 --> 01:36:54,884
Every flower, every
path, every house.

962
01:36:54,924 --> 01:36:57,866
O beloved!

963
01:36:57,906 --> 01:37:01,366
Without you, o beloved!

964
01:37:03,046 --> 01:37:07,057
My heart burns, it misses you.

965
01:37:07,225 --> 01:37:10,959
Every flower, every path,
every house.

966
01:37:11,069 --> 01:37:13,773
O beloved!

967
01:37:13,813 --> 01:37:17,281
Without you, o beloved!

968
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:26,878
I was told over the
trunk call that..

969
01:37:26,918 --> 01:37:29,118
She wanted to marry you, and
you wanted to marry her.

970
01:37:29,187 --> 01:37:30,315
But what do I see when I come here?

971
01:37:30,339 --> 01:37:33,478
She is lying in her room crying.
You are drinking beer here.

972
01:37:33,518 --> 01:37:34,678
What is the matter after all?

973
01:37:37,363 --> 01:37:38,363
Uncle..

974
01:37:38,451 --> 01:37:41,845
This isn't iowar and neither
jowar pancake.

975
01:37:42,299 --> 01:37:46,245
This is called as romance, or love.

976
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:49,477
You didn't understand?

977
01:37:49,593 --> 01:37:52,911
You didn't understand?

978
01:37:52,951 --> 01:37:54,911
What madness is this?

979
01:37:54,951 --> 01:37:57,410
Listen to me, uncle..

980
01:37:57,565 --> 01:38:01,690
Where are you going
o mustached uncle?

981
01:38:01,730 --> 01:38:03,927
Sing, dance and have fun.

982
01:38:03,967 --> 01:38:07,223
Move away, you insolent
crazy donkey.

983
01:38:07,263 --> 01:38:08,687
What will the world say if they see?

984
01:38:08,711 --> 01:38:11,703
They will say that you
son-in-law loves you.

985
01:38:13,544 --> 01:38:17,276
What a way His Maiesty found out
to clear himself from his path.

986
01:38:18,875 --> 01:38:22,370
Princess, are you still thinking
about that crazy man?

987
01:38:22,410 --> 01:38:24,426
Whether she is thinking of
that crazy man or not..

988
01:38:24,466 --> 01:38:26,523
But I won't allow this
marriage to take place.

989
01:38:31,728 --> 01:38:34,761
Not only is he insolent and
stupid, he is crazy too.

990
01:38:35,211 --> 01:38:39,278
He pressed his cigarette
in my breakfast omelet.

991
01:38:39,721 --> 01:38:41,684
I thought that it must
have been his mistake.

992
01:38:41,845 --> 01:38:45,135
But today, he started playing
with my moustaches.

993
01:38:45,426 --> 01:38:47,724
And he put his arm
over my waist and..

994
01:38:47,866 --> 01:38:49,986
Started dancing like I was
a sixteen year old girl.

995
01:38:55,161 --> 01:38:59,024
You simple and cute mustached uncle!

996
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:03,727
No! Never!

997
01:39:03,872 --> 01:39:06,023
This mad man will never
become my son-in-law.

998
01:39:06,093 --> 01:39:08,008
- Did you hear that, Poonam?
- Yes.

999
01:39:36,761 --> 01:39:39,999
Your maiesty, till when you
search for that crazy man?

1000
01:39:41,866 --> 01:39:43,887
Till the time I don't meet him.

1001
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:18,908
Bring two bread and butter.
Bring to hard bread and butter.

1002
01:40:18,948 --> 01:40:21,268
Fry sir's heart. Two coco colas,
quickly, give water there.

1003
01:40:21,767 --> 01:40:24,057
Here you are. Quickly, very good.

1004
01:40:24,207 --> 01:40:26,138
Sir, your tea?

1005
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:33,252
What are you doing?

1006
01:40:33,876 --> 01:40:35,877
I had vowed to Sai Baba that the..

1007
01:40:35,917 --> 01:40:37,727
Day you work for a whole week..

1008
01:40:37,793 --> 01:40:40,728
I will put one and a quarter
rupee on your head.

1009
01:40:42,126 --> 01:40:44,753
You are taking vows
and I'm thinking..

1010
01:40:44,794 --> 01:40:46,785
Of leaving my iob
and going somewhere.

1011
01:40:47,579 --> 01:40:48,661
That same talk again.

1012
01:40:48,701 --> 01:40:52,432
If you don't work, where
you eat and drink from?

1013
01:40:52,472 --> 01:40:53,587
How will you survive?

1014
01:40:53,627 --> 01:40:55,216
Who wants to survive?

1015
01:40:56,043 --> 01:40:58,131
What is such a great apocalypse?

1016
01:40:58,368 --> 01:41:02,359
If you'd ever be kicked in
love, you'd understand.

1017
01:41:02,476 --> 01:41:06,729
Now, for me, eating, drinking,
sleeping, waking and living.

1018
01:41:07,393 --> 01:41:08,987
All of it is useless now.

1019
01:41:10,019 --> 01:41:11,717
I don't understand what
I should do now.

1020
01:41:12,092 --> 01:41:13,212
Should I tell you?

1021
01:41:13,793 --> 01:41:14,875
You go back.

1022
01:41:14,915 --> 01:41:17,856
She is a princess, it won't be
difficult to search for her.

1023
01:41:18,290 --> 01:41:21,522
It won't be difficult to find her.
But with what face should I go?

1024
01:41:22,436 --> 01:41:24,522
She must hate even my name now.

1025
01:41:25,544 --> 01:41:28,369
But it's possible that hearing
your problem she must..

1026
01:41:28,409 --> 01:41:30,841
Be yearning for you. And
as soon as she sees you..

1027
01:41:30,881 --> 01:41:33,643
She marries you and makes
you a king of her kingdom.

1028
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:36,173
I became a king and saw it once.

1029
01:41:36,801 --> 01:41:38,987
I don't have an ambition
to become it once again.

1030
01:41:40,118 --> 01:41:42,795
Yes, if she was a commoner and..

1031
01:41:42,835 --> 01:41:45,888
She'd make me the king
of her heat, I swear..

1032
01:41:49,726 --> 01:41:51,434
But the truth is that..

1033
01:41:51,634 --> 01:41:53,617
That neither is she
a commoner and nor..

1034
01:41:56,171 --> 01:41:59,729
Do I want to become a king
due to someone's alms.

1035
01:42:06,581 --> 01:42:07,581
Hot water.

1036
01:42:09,009 --> 01:42:10,057
Hot water.

1037
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:15,385
- Should I bring cold water?
- I don't want anything.

1038
01:42:16,365 --> 01:42:19,643
I should leave all these perks and..

1039
01:42:19,683 --> 01:42:22,840
- Practice living like a commoner.
- But why?

1040
01:42:23,883 --> 01:42:25,725
Because the person with whom..

1041
01:42:26,465 --> 01:42:28,283
I want to spend my life
with is a commoner.

1042
01:42:29,586 --> 01:42:30,586
What?

1043
01:42:30,699 --> 01:42:33,163
I thought that it was
a joke and it was over.

1044
01:42:35,369 --> 01:42:39,503
This ioke will end with
the end of life now.

1045
01:42:43,945 --> 01:42:45,724
You forgot the challan here.

1046
01:42:57,437 --> 01:42:59,522
- Who is it?
- The gas man.

1047
01:43:02,351 --> 01:43:03,857
You came so late.

1048
01:43:04,089 --> 01:43:06,089
- Where do I have to make the connection?
- Inside.

1049
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:32,242
Hey, have you come for the
connection or to stare at girls?

1050
01:43:32,282 --> 01:43:34,051
Connect it and go.

1051
01:43:39,258 --> 01:43:40,325
Princess..

1052
01:43:41,219 --> 01:43:43,106
I am not a princess.

1053
01:43:44,257 --> 01:43:46,730
Then how did you recognize me?

1054
01:43:47,369 --> 01:43:49,886
I am Poonam, who met you in Kashmir.

1055
01:43:50,313 --> 01:43:51,313
But..

1056
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:54,480
But Poonam and the princess
are one and the same.

1057
01:43:54,615 --> 01:43:56,603
No, I am not a princess.

1058
01:43:57,205 --> 01:43:59,400
Just like you were sent
as a king there..

1059
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,852
Just like that I was sent
there as a princess.

1060
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:04,051
But..

1061
01:44:04,186 --> 01:44:06,525
Poonam's eyes were blue,
that's it, isn't it?

1062
01:44:07,467 --> 01:44:09,898
See. These are the contact
lenses which..

1063
01:44:10,081 --> 01:44:12,455
I wore to become the princess.

1064
01:44:16,206 --> 01:44:17,884
Please believe me, Raju.

1065
01:44:18,268 --> 01:44:20,470
Just like you, even my
life was played with..

1066
01:44:20,875 --> 01:44:22,733
Taking advantage of my poverty.

1067
01:44:22,773 --> 01:44:26,948
I was made a princess for a few
days and was told to fake a drama.

1068
01:44:27,314 --> 01:44:30,856
But that drama and the
game became bondage.

1069
01:44:31,441 --> 01:44:33,441
I fell in love with you, Raju.

1070
01:44:34,027 --> 01:44:35,727
And I couldn't tell you the truth.

1071
01:44:36,163 --> 01:44:39,427
Because I was afraid that
you shouldn't hate me.

1072
01:44:43,764 --> 01:44:46,442
Don't suspect me like this, Raju.

1073
01:44:46,893 --> 01:44:50,722
Even you'd lied to me.
You met me as a king.

1074
01:44:51,297 --> 01:44:55,557
Your faked your false love.
You promised me life together.

1075
01:44:56,046 --> 01:44:58,310
But before I could tell
you everything..

1076
01:44:59,005 --> 01:45:01,025
You disappeared all of a sudden.

1077
01:45:01,617 --> 01:45:03,921
You didn't even turn
back once and see.

1078
01:45:04,365 --> 01:45:07,239
Those promises just
went on as talks.

1079
01:45:08,076 --> 01:45:10,490
And me.. I had gone crazy.

1080
01:45:11,351 --> 01:45:14,057
I searched around everywhere
in Bombay.

1081
01:45:14,415 --> 01:45:15,477
But I couldn't find you.

1082
01:45:16,282 --> 01:45:19,318
And when I met you, your
eyes are accusing me.

1083
01:45:20,536 --> 01:45:22,358
Won't you forget me for this..

1084
01:45:23,146 --> 01:45:25,792
Small lie and this drama?

1085
01:45:31,976 --> 01:45:33,816
There isn't anything
to forgive in this.

1086
01:45:34,069 --> 01:45:37,275
The both of us are equally guilty
for whatever happened.

1087
01:45:37,487 --> 01:45:39,817
We both are equally at fault

1088
01:45:40,081 --> 01:45:42,160
But what occurred, if it hadn't..

1089
01:45:42,366 --> 01:45:46,190
The two of us wouldn't
have met like this.

1090
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:54,641
There isn't any wall
between us today.

1091
01:45:55,132 --> 01:46:01,527
I am a common man and you
are my common queen.

1092
01:46:07,875 --> 01:46:11,483
"You are the peacock
of the jungle I am.."

1093
01:46:11,523 --> 01:46:16,817
"The peacock of the garden,
we play hide and seek."

1094
01:46:16,857 --> 01:46:20,481
"Come, we will talk a bit."

1095
01:46:20,521 --> 01:46:25,444
"We will talk and we will meet."

1096
01:46:25,484 --> 01:46:29,815
"My name is Chandni,
your name is Chakor.."

1097
01:46:29,855 --> 01:46:31,821
"And playing hide and seek."

1098
01:46:32,304 --> 01:46:37,929
"Playing hide and seek,
we will talk a bit."

1099
01:47:07,341 --> 01:47:15,341
"We stay in the Love land."

1100
01:47:22,621 --> 01:47:27,566
"How are we connected
to this world?'"

1101
01:47:32,482 --> 01:47:38,656
"I am the wild cloud."

1102
01:47:40,922 --> 01:47:44,992
"You are the nice breeze."

1103
01:48:27,897 --> 01:48:33,120
"Subtly, you say these
legends of love."

1104
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:38,065
"Like the flowers of spring
speak to the cuckoo."

1105
01:48:49,275 --> 01:48:53,882
"If someone hears it, there
will be a hullabaloo."

1106
01:49:25,804 --> 01:49:33,804
"I will settler in your hair."

1107
01:49:38,613 --> 01:49:41,109
"Breaking all the bondages."

1108
01:49:41,149 --> 01:49:46,156
"I will settle in your eyes
leaving the whole world."

1109
01:49:50,944 --> 01:49:57,116
"If this breath stops."

1110
01:49:57,156 --> 01:50:01,412
"If this breath stops, this
love shouldn't stop."

1111
01:50:55,585 --> 01:50:57,421
Bring two breads and butter.

1112
01:50:57,461 --> 01:51:00,833
Bring two coca
- colas.

1113
01:51:01,148 --> 01:51:02,929
Fry sir's brain here.

1114
01:51:02,969 --> 01:51:05,839
Why do these people put their
fingers in the water?

1115
01:51:06,533 --> 01:51:07,937
Because the tea is very hot.
If they put their fingers..

1116
01:51:07,961 --> 01:51:09,736
In the tea, they will
burn their fingers.

1117
01:51:10,579 --> 01:51:11,689
I meant to say..

1118
01:51:11,729 --> 01:51:13,634
Why are these people so unhygienic?

1119
01:51:13,868 --> 01:51:18,773
See. This cup is broken.
There can be germs in it too.

1120
01:51:19,110 --> 01:51:21,325
Why? Have you become
a princess again?

1121
01:51:22,596 --> 01:51:23,890
I didn't become one.

1122
01:51:23,930 --> 01:51:26,237
But I have acted as one for
so many days, isn't it?

1123
01:51:26,359 --> 01:51:28,472
It is better if you forget
it as soon as possible.

1124
01:51:28,673 --> 01:51:30,873
- Otherwise, if you come to my house and..
- Your house?

1125
01:51:31,018 --> 01:51:32,597
That will be done too.

1126
01:51:33,356 --> 01:51:35,606
Poonam, I was thinking..

1127
01:51:35,858 --> 01:51:37,869
To make a small house quickly.

1128
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:43,579
In which you and I stay together
forever and ever.

1129
01:51:44,743 --> 01:51:46,769
You are thinking where
will I get money..

1130
01:51:46,809 --> 01:51:48,903
From to make a house
from, isn't it?

1131
01:51:49,868 --> 01:51:51,302
- No.
- Liar!

1132
01:51:52,922 --> 01:51:57,047
Crazy girl. Your Raju maybe
poor and illiterate.

1133
01:51:57,376 --> 01:52:00,709
But he certainly knows that
a house is needed to marry.

1134
01:52:01,108 --> 01:52:02,853
And to make a house,
money is needed.

1135
01:52:02,893 --> 01:52:04,627
And to make money, a iob is needed.

1136
01:52:05,337 --> 01:52:08,073
I have decided to work in
three places from tomorrow.

1137
01:52:08,242 --> 01:52:12,692
- Three places?
- Yes, in the day, night and.. - Amrapali.

1138
01:52:14,910 --> 01:52:17,920
- So when will you meet me?
- In the middle.

1139
01:52:23,076 --> 01:52:27,172
- What must be the time now?
- Whatever was yesterday.

1140
01:52:27,775 --> 01:52:29,272
I think that I am late.

1141
01:52:30,354 --> 01:52:32,306
Therefore I am thinking
of making a house.

1142
01:52:32,881 --> 01:52:35,644
There shouldn't be any time
problem or any darkness.

1143
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:40,641
"We will make a beautiful
boat house."

1144
01:52:40,954 --> 01:52:45,263
"In which, our family will stay!"

1145
01:52:45,303 --> 01:52:48,059
"A family.."

1146
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:59,646
Another small flower for you.

1147
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:02,220
Yes?

1148
01:53:02,743 --> 01:53:06,736
Will you father chase
us even after marriage?

1149
01:53:06,809 --> 01:53:10,177
I mean, will he stay
with us forcibly?

1150
01:53:11,461 --> 01:53:14,976
You have spoken to my father
about marriage, isn't it?

1151
01:53:15,395 --> 01:53:18,576
That's it. We can't talk anything.

1152
01:53:19,263 --> 01:53:24,571
My tongue wavers when
I go to your father.

1153
01:53:24,643 --> 01:53:27,578
- Not only tongue..
- Who is it?

1154
01:53:30,826 --> 01:53:35,226
Looking at me, your body
shakes and trembles.

1155
01:53:35,348 --> 01:53:39,238
- What can I do? You look like that.
- What did you say?

1156
01:53:39,716 --> 01:53:42,922
See, if you wish to
marry my daughter..

1157
01:53:42,962 --> 01:53:45,908
You will have to
be strong like me.

1158
01:53:46,022 --> 01:53:49,002
I am very strong from inside.

1159
01:53:49,383 --> 01:53:51,306
I seem to be like this to
you from the outside.

1160
01:53:51,622 --> 01:53:53,695
But I want someone
same outside and..

1161
01:53:53,735 --> 01:53:56,162
Inside for my daughter,
understood?

1162
01:53:57,291 --> 01:53:59,167
Your stance should be like iron.

1163
01:53:59,404 --> 01:54:01,898
Your chest should be like
a mace. Understood?

1164
01:54:01,938 --> 01:54:06,190
- Yes. I did! I will try to be strong! Strong!
- Very good.

1165
01:54:07,397 --> 01:54:12,459
Forty four.. forty five.. very good.

1166
01:54:12,499 --> 01:54:19,431
Forty six.. forty seven..
Wow.. forty eight!

1167
01:54:20,574 --> 01:54:25,189
Forty nine.. sixty..

1168
01:54:28,882 --> 01:54:33,613
- Seventy.. eighty..
- Wait.

1169
01:54:34,103 --> 01:54:36,038
You are doing some mistake.

1170
01:54:36,323 --> 01:54:40,171
There is no mistake, father-in-law,
you see. See

1171
01:54:41,643 --> 01:54:46,417
- Ninety.
- Ninety. - Hundred. - Hundred.

1172
01:54:46,858 --> 01:54:50,528
One hundred and ten. One
hundred and twenty.

1173
01:54:50,568 --> 01:54:52,064
You con man.

1174
01:54:55,778 --> 01:54:57,164
What are you doing?

1175
01:54:57,205 --> 01:55:00,364
- You are doing something wrong in the counting.
- Why?

1176
01:55:00,477 --> 01:55:01,854
You are counting everything wrong.

1177
01:55:01,895 --> 01:55:03,793
- It will be done again.
- What will be done again?

1178
01:55:03,817 --> 01:55:06,986
- You will have to exercise again.
- Again? - Yes.

1179
01:55:08,758 --> 01:55:11,415
- But where has he gone?
- To earn money.

1180
01:55:11,545 --> 01:55:13,905
- He has to make a house, isn't it?
- May such a house burn!

1181
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:17,889
He works all through the day.
What if something happens to him?

1182
01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:20,497
- Someone called Raju..
- What happened to Raju?

1183
01:55:20,656 --> 01:55:21,656
See there.

1184
01:55:31,530 --> 01:55:34,325
- What happened to him?
- Doctor said that he needs some sleep.

1185
01:55:34,510 --> 01:55:37,958
Okay, thank you for
bringing him here.

1186
01:55:38,176 --> 01:55:43,698
Raju, get up. How long
will you sleep now?

1187
01:56:01,035 --> 01:56:03,908
- What must be the time now?
- Whatever it was yesterday at this time.

1188
01:56:04,435 --> 01:56:07,491
- Then I should go to work.
- You aren't working today.

1189
01:56:07,531 --> 01:56:09,571
I don't have to go to work,
I have to see the flat.

1190
01:56:10,105 --> 01:56:12,111
The flat won't run away.
Take it tomorrow.

1191
01:56:12,215 --> 01:56:13,636
No!

1192
01:56:13,967 --> 01:56:17,710
I have go to Shivdasani, the
house agent to see the flat.

1193
01:56:17,971 --> 01:56:18,916
Look at this. Look at this.

1194
01:56:18,956 --> 01:56:23,592
- I have brought so much money.
- So much money?

1195
01:56:23,757 --> 01:56:25,557
- Where did you get them from?
- Yes, come on.

1196
01:56:26,321 --> 01:56:31,138
Sir, did you see the sitting room
there? This is the bedroom.

1197
01:56:31,361 --> 01:56:33,979
- Can we not sleep here?
- It is a big room.

1198
01:56:34,108 --> 01:56:36,398
It is 15 by 12
- What is it of?

1199
01:56:36,557 --> 01:56:38,289
Raju, don't ioke.

1200
01:56:38,534 --> 01:56:41,490
Please come, come.

1201
01:56:42,054 --> 01:56:45,833
And see this. Sir, look at this.
This is the bathroom.

1202
01:56:47,821 --> 01:56:49,093
The water is for twenty
four hours, isn't it?

1203
01:56:49,117 --> 01:56:51,433
Twenty four hours.

1204
01:56:52,938 --> 01:56:54,287
Raju!

1205
01:56:54,809 --> 01:56:57,325
I am sorry. I thought that
this was for some fountain.

1206
01:56:57,643 --> 01:56:59,400
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

1207
01:56:59,475 --> 01:57:02,526
Please come, sister.

1208
01:57:03,385 --> 01:57:05,237
- I am wet.
- What you are wet?

1209
01:57:07,832 --> 01:57:10,709
- Sir, you are taking the flat for yourself, isn't it?
- Yes.

1210
01:57:10,938 --> 01:57:14,130
- Do you like the house?
- It is good. - It is good.

1211
01:57:14,171 --> 01:57:15,330
What will be the rent?

1212
01:57:15,370 --> 01:57:18,275
It is no big deal. Three months
advance rent, one month running.

1213
01:57:18,315 --> 01:57:19,235
And commission for two months.

1214
01:57:19,275 --> 01:57:22,906
All in all one thousand seven
hundred and ninety rupees.

1215
01:57:24,213 --> 01:57:26,347
And you must know the
'turban' charges too.

1216
01:57:26,971 --> 01:57:29,019
But I didn't come here to take any
'turbans'. I came here to take flats.

1217
01:57:29,043 --> 01:57:32,764
One doesn't have to take,
but give turbans in Bombay.

1218
01:57:32,804 --> 01:57:34,707
The rate is sixteen thousand rupees.

1219
01:57:34,747 --> 01:57:37,279
All in one seventeen thousand,
seven hundred and ninety rupees.

1220
01:57:37,902 --> 01:57:39,634
Sir, this isn't the bedroom.

1221
01:57:44,048 --> 01:57:46,211
- Three hundred and eighty rupees.
- Bring it.

1222
01:57:46,370 --> 01:57:48,010
Three hundred and eighty and this.

1223
01:57:48,050 --> 01:57:50,921
All in all, one thousand,
two hundred and seventy.

1224
01:57:51,868 --> 01:57:54,515
But one needs sixteen thousand..

1225
01:57:54,854 --> 01:57:58,026
Seven hundred and ninety rupees.

1226
01:57:59,706 --> 01:58:03,452
I have an idea. There is an
old woman staying next to it.

1227
01:58:03,492 --> 01:58:05,412
She has a room empty there.

1228
01:58:05,452 --> 01:58:09,544
I will tell her, that the two of
you wish to make a room there.

1229
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:12,241
- Room?
- Room.. A hut.

1230
01:58:12,377 --> 01:58:16,986
You call it a bungalow if you wish.
Come on, I'll show you.

1231
01:58:17,911 --> 01:58:20,139
- Father.. O father..
- Yes?

1232
01:58:20,262 --> 01:58:21,827
Please accept this proposal.

1233
01:58:21,867 --> 01:58:24,214
He loves me a lot.

1234
01:58:24,583 --> 01:58:26,061
I love him too.

1235
01:58:26,285 --> 01:58:28,581
I wish him to marry you.

1236
01:58:28,621 --> 01:58:30,251
But I want him to be strong.

1237
01:58:30,366 --> 01:58:33,518
I told him to carry the wood.
He said that he couldn't.

1238
01:58:34,282 --> 01:58:35,681
You are a strange man.

1239
01:58:35,780 --> 01:58:38,413
What is the connection to
the wood to our marriage?

1240
01:58:38,926 --> 01:58:42,640
What can I tell you now? There
is a deep connection.

1241
01:58:42,696 --> 01:58:45,476
The person who can't
carry the wood..

1242
01:58:45,692 --> 01:58:47,832
How will he carry my daughter?

1243
01:58:47,872 --> 01:58:49,916
- He will carry it.
- What happened to your voice?

1244
01:58:50,118 --> 01:58:51,885
Father, see behind.

1245
01:58:55,167 --> 01:58:59,509
I will carry the wood as
well as your daughter.

1246
01:58:59,717 --> 01:59:01,412
- The wood?
- Father!

1247
01:59:03,392 --> 01:59:05,181
Hey, he was here, where
did he run away?

1248
01:59:05,221 --> 01:59:08,242
Hey! You kept the wood by the tree!

1249
02:00:50,150 --> 02:00:51,150
Uncle..

1250
02:00:52,576 --> 02:00:55,080
Hey, girl! Hey, girl.

1251
02:00:56,417 --> 02:00:58,334
- I am calling you.
- But why?

1252
02:00:58,550 --> 02:01:00,344
- Who are you?
- Why do you want to know?

1253
02:01:00,384 --> 02:01:02,393
- Will you come with me?
- Aren't you ashamed?

1254
02:01:02,433 --> 02:01:03,933
You must be having a
daughter of my age.

1255
02:01:03,957 --> 02:01:05,407
And he has come to take me away.

1256
02:01:06,083 --> 02:01:08,142
Listen, daughter. You are wrong.

1257
02:01:08,217 --> 02:01:10,549
I don't have a daughter of your
age, but a grand daughter.

1258
02:01:10,617 --> 02:01:11,784
Come with me.

1259
02:01:11,824 --> 02:01:13,403
I wish to see the two
of you together.

1260
02:01:13,443 --> 02:01:16,750
No! Didn't I tell you?
I won't come with you.

1261
02:01:16,914 --> 02:01:20,340
What will the other people say
if I go in such a huge car?

1262
02:01:20,528 --> 02:01:22,548
Okay, listen. I will
bring a taxi for you.

1263
02:01:23,009 --> 02:01:26,033
Whether you bring a taxi or a
cycle, I won't come with you.

1264
02:01:26,073 --> 02:01:30,151
Okay, show me your house. I will
bring my grand daughter here.

1265
02:01:31,766 --> 02:01:36,081
- Okay, I will come with you.
- Very good. Come on.

1266
02:01:45,665 --> 02:01:50,858
- Sit down. Not here.
- Okay.

1267
02:01:51,833 --> 02:01:54,074
- What is your name?
- Jayshree.

1268
02:01:57,102 --> 02:02:00,592
- Is Malti the name of the prince?
- No.

1269
02:02:03,622 --> 02:02:04,711
Come here.

1270
02:02:07,877 --> 02:02:10,443
- Even you were surprised, isn't it?
- Yes.

1271
02:02:10,483 --> 02:02:12,803
This isn't Poonam, this is Jayshree.

1272
02:02:13,695 --> 02:02:16,139
Even I was thinking how
could that be possible?

1273
02:02:16,179 --> 02:02:18,254
There is a princess upstairs
and downstairs too.

1274
02:02:18,294 --> 02:02:21,084
- Do the two of us look so similar?
- Yes.

1275
02:02:21,704 --> 02:02:23,507
Go, go and bring the
princess downstairs.

1276
02:02:27,415 --> 02:02:29,693
- Where is Poonam?
- She is in her room.

1277
02:02:29,852 --> 02:02:31,541
Go and bring her downstairs.

1278
02:02:32,131 --> 02:02:34,313
Wait, I will come there too.

1279
02:02:35,568 --> 02:02:37,811
Stay here till I come back.

1280
02:02:37,851 --> 02:02:41,168
- If you say, I will stay here forever.
- Okay.

1281
02:02:41,659 --> 02:02:44,079
What? I will think about that later.

1282
02:02:52,013 --> 02:02:52,962
Where is Poonam?

1283
02:02:53,002 --> 02:02:54,851
She is having her bath,
Your Highness.

1284
02:02:54,952 --> 02:02:58,083
But the door is open.

1285
02:02:58,630 --> 02:03:00,970
What about the door?
I will close it.

1286
02:03:01,010 --> 02:03:02,975
But there isn't any
noise from inside.

1287
02:03:03,916 --> 02:03:05,474
I can hear the sound.

1288
02:03:05,514 --> 02:03:07,759
The princess is singing
beneath the shower.

1289
02:03:13,890 --> 02:03:17,418
- She is singing and only you can hear it?
- Yes.

1290
02:03:23,148 --> 02:03:24,928
What has happened to you, uncle?

1291
02:03:25,043 --> 02:03:27,754
You could have knocked.
You could have called me.

1292
02:03:28,310 --> 02:03:30,806
I thought that you
weren't downstairs.

1293
02:03:30,994 --> 02:03:34,175
Anyway, that girl who
resembles you has come.

1294
02:03:36,463 --> 02:03:40,617
Okay, you go downstairs.
I will dress up and come.

1295
02:03:44,949 --> 02:03:48,014
- What will happen now?
- You don't worry.

1296
02:03:49,941 --> 02:03:51,412
Princess, your eyes..

1297
02:03:58,856 --> 02:03:59,856
Where is the girl?

1298
02:04:00,623 --> 02:04:02,611
Sir, she is outside.

1299
02:04:02,777 --> 02:04:03,921
Didn't you stop her?

1300
02:04:04,032 --> 02:04:08,449
I stopped her a lot, but
she didn't listen.

1301
02:04:08,489 --> 02:04:10,306
Why didn't you follow her?

1302
02:04:11,472 --> 02:04:16,463
My father told me when
I was a child..

1303
02:04:16,773 --> 02:04:22,060
That honest boys like
me don't chase girls.

1304
02:04:27,244 --> 02:04:29,509
Can I take this flower?

1305
02:04:29,776 --> 02:04:32,145
Yes, take it. But go inside now.

1306
02:04:32,469 --> 02:04:34,208
Sir, it is Kunwar's call.

1307
02:04:34,709 --> 02:04:36,959
Okay, Kunwar's call.

1308
02:04:43,805 --> 02:04:46,250
- The princess has called her upstairs.
- Okay.

1309
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:47,986
Okay, I will come upstairs too.

1310
02:04:49,062 --> 02:04:50,241
Please come.

1311
02:04:52,976 --> 02:04:55,503
You go to Vile Parle right now.
Raju must have come there.

1312
02:04:55,543 --> 02:04:57,860
- I didn't tell him before coming here.
- But uncle..

1313
02:04:58,090 --> 02:05:00,077
Don't worry about him.
I will change my clothes..

1314
02:05:00,118 --> 02:05:02,828
And tell him that the
girl met me and left.

1315
02:05:08,107 --> 02:05:12,044
Where did that girl go?

1316
02:05:12,340 --> 02:05:14,269
She met me and went away.

1317
02:05:14,730 --> 02:05:18,586
You were right. She actually
looks like me.

1318
02:05:18,626 --> 02:05:20,729
I wanted to see the
two of you together.

1319
02:05:20,887 --> 02:05:23,925
Therefore I brought her here,
and you didn't stop her?

1320
02:05:24,047 --> 02:05:27,280
Meet her some day later. Malti
has gone to leave her.

1321
02:05:27,542 --> 02:05:29,122
She will see where she lives.

1322
02:05:30,748 --> 02:05:32,141
Can I go now?

1323
02:05:32,687 --> 02:05:36,755
- I have a Social welfare Organization meeting.
- Go.

1324
02:05:46,867 --> 02:05:49,561
Did you see any girl go with Malti?

1325
02:05:49,601 --> 02:05:52,247
No, sir. Malti went alone from here.

1326
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:04,569
It's good that uncle didn't
know about this.

1327
02:06:04,929 --> 02:06:07,384
But for how long will
you hide this from him?

1328
02:06:07,536 --> 02:06:11,091
I am thinking till when
will I hide it from Raju?

1329
02:06:11,670 --> 02:06:13,931
I will have to tell him
some day or the other.

1330
02:06:14,043 --> 02:06:15,442
That I am the princess.

1331
02:06:25,963 --> 02:06:29,483
Are you ready to marry her even
after knowing all this?

1332
02:06:29,634 --> 02:06:32,634
Everyone does such
mistakes in youth.

1333
02:06:33,563 --> 02:06:35,539
Then, there is only one way out.

1334
02:06:36,762 --> 02:06:40,915
Poonam shouldn't find out
that we know about her.

1335
02:06:41,698 --> 02:06:44,640
Before any negative word
comes out of her lips..

1336
02:06:45,102 --> 02:06:47,197
I will fix her marriage
proposal with you.

1337
02:06:47,897 --> 02:06:49,578
You are right, uncle.

1338
02:06:55,030 --> 02:06:56,030
Yes?

1339
02:06:56,240 --> 02:06:58,457
- Set this somewhere.
- Just a minute.

1340
02:07:05,782 --> 02:07:11,393
Two bodies and one soul,
Like you and I. Isn't it, Poonam?

1341
02:07:27,849 --> 02:07:29,141
What happened?

1342
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:33,030
- See, look at this.
- So what? It was made of clay.

1343
02:07:33,355 --> 02:07:36,195
We will get a new one. Come with me.

1344
02:07:36,236 --> 02:07:39,893
I will show you something.
Look at this.

1345
02:07:44,025 --> 02:07:46,775
- But these are flowers of plastic.
- They are beautiful, isn't it?

1346
02:07:46,815 --> 02:07:49,602
But they are fake. Poonam, there..

1347
02:07:49,642 --> 02:07:51,833
Is no need of any falsehood
in this house.

1348
02:07:52,136 --> 02:07:55,939
The base of this house has
been put on love and truth.

1349
02:07:56,244 --> 02:07:58,992
And these things are the
pride of this house.

1350
02:07:59,107 --> 02:08:00,677
And beauty.

1351
02:08:02,502 --> 02:08:03,904
Do you remember, Poonam?

1352
02:08:03,944 --> 02:08:07,287
I was scared of listening
the 'Truth is beautiful'..

1353
02:08:07,327 --> 02:08:09,289
Hymn in Kashmir once. But today..

1354
02:08:10,934 --> 02:08:16,580
I am seeing you as the form
of hymn in front of me.

1355
02:08:17,077 --> 02:08:18,077
And I..

1356
02:08:22,033 --> 02:08:23,489
What happened to you?

1357
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:26,489
Nothing. I am late.
I have to go now.

1358
02:08:27,086 --> 02:08:29,898
The house is ready now.
Why don't you come here to stay?

1359
02:08:30,878 --> 02:08:34,421
Women don't stay in the to be
husband's house before marriage.

1360
02:08:34,461 --> 02:08:36,859
So what are we waiting for?
There is a temple nearby.

1361
02:08:36,899 --> 02:08:39,794
- We will go and marry there right away.
- Not today. - Tomorrow?

1362
02:08:39,834 --> 02:08:42,390
- Not tomorrow too.
- Then surely, day after tomorrow.

1363
02:08:42,715 --> 02:08:46,135
The sun will rise there and
I will mount the horse.

1364
02:08:46,826 --> 02:08:49,087
- Okay, I will go now.
- No, wait. I will come too.

1365
02:08:49,127 --> 02:08:51,010
Why? Why don't you stay here?

1366
02:08:52,824 --> 02:08:56,055
No, Poonam. A house is
made by a housewife.

1367
02:08:56,818 --> 02:09:02,046
This house will settle when
you come here as a housewife.

1368
02:09:06,636 --> 02:09:10,003
You will surely have to come
to my marriage party.

1369
02:09:10,263 --> 02:09:13,653
I promise you, I will surely come
to your marriage reception.

1370
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:18,707
Poor people just have a marriage,
no receptions.

1371
02:09:20,123 --> 02:09:21,457
That is just Raju..

1372
02:09:22,632 --> 02:09:28,323
So do you think that I'll stay a
princess, marrying a poor man?

1373
02:09:29,038 --> 02:09:30,038
Then?

1374
02:09:30,496 --> 02:09:33,084
After marriage, just
like how all girls..

1375
02:09:33,124 --> 02:09:36,429
Leave their parent's
house and go..

1376
02:09:37,028 --> 02:09:39,104
To their in-law's house
like that, I will go too.

1377
02:09:39,457 --> 02:09:41,783
We have made a small house too.

1378
02:09:41,892 --> 02:09:43,792
Then, call him tonight too.

1379
02:09:43,908 --> 02:09:45,449
No, I can't call him.

1380
02:09:45,622 --> 02:09:48,640
He doesn't know that I
am a princess till now.

1381
02:09:49,066 --> 02:09:51,435
But till when will you
hide this from him?

1382
02:09:51,475 --> 02:09:54,134
After tonight's party.
I will speak to uncle.

1383
02:09:54,850 --> 02:09:58,460
I don't want this kingdom,
money or wealth.

1384
02:09:59,289 --> 02:10:00,289
And then..

1385
02:10:00,891 --> 02:10:04,700
I will really become a common
woman and go to my Raju.

1386
02:10:04,966 --> 02:10:07,127
May God keep you two happy.

1387
02:10:07,167 --> 02:10:09,261
But be sure to come
to my party tonight.

1388
02:10:09,301 --> 02:10:11,190
Yes, I will surely come.

1389
02:10:12,939 --> 02:10:15,062
Yes, Mr. D'Mello told
me that tonight..

1390
02:10:15,102 --> 02:10:17,389
There is a party of Mr.
D'Mello's wedding.

1391
02:10:17,742 --> 02:10:19,064
Were you not invited?

1392
02:10:19,133 --> 02:10:24,537
No, but I will surely go.
To congratulate him.

1393
02:10:29,166 --> 02:10:31,514
Excuse me. Could you tell
me where Poonam lives?

1394
02:10:31,554 --> 02:10:33,209
- Poonam?
- Yes, the one who lives here.

1395
02:10:33,249 --> 02:10:34,954
Oh! Those artistes!

1396
02:10:35,599 --> 02:10:38,777
They don't live here. They
come here for an hour.

1397
02:10:39,275 --> 02:10:41,330
They don't live here,
just come here?

1398
02:10:41,370 --> 02:10:42,549
Then they go too.

1399
02:10:42,589 --> 02:10:46,104
One comes in a shiny and gaudy
saree and blue eyes.

1400
02:10:46,283 --> 02:10:49,709
And goes in a cheap
saree and black eyes.

1401
02:10:49,817 --> 02:10:52,752
And another comes in young,
and goes out old.

1402
02:11:34,784 --> 02:11:37,466
When all of you are present here.

1403
02:11:37,772 --> 02:11:39,011
Who have our and the princess's..

1404
02:11:39,035 --> 02:11:41,147
Happiness close to their heart.

1405
02:11:41,533 --> 02:11:44,170
I wish to give you this good news.

1406
02:11:44,210 --> 02:11:45,844
I wish to announce the engagement..

1407
02:11:46,031 --> 02:11:47,592
Of my grand daughter, Princess

1408
02:11:47,668 --> 02:11:50,049
Poonam and the Prince Bhadrasing

1409
02:12:07,333 --> 02:12:08,638
Your maiesty..

1410
02:12:16,668 --> 02:12:18,068
Congratulations on your engagement.

1411
02:12:20,908 --> 02:12:24,560
May God keep the house rich and..

1412
02:12:25,205 --> 02:12:29,164
Prosperous in which
you go as a bride.

1413
02:12:30,533 --> 02:12:31,910
I didn't know..

1414
02:12:32,734 --> 02:12:37,646
Or else I would have brought
a few flowers for you.

1415
02:12:38,599 --> 02:12:40,590
You didn't get flowers?
It doesn't matter.

1416
02:12:41,066 --> 02:12:44,001
Just sing us a song as blossoming
like the flowers.

1417
02:12:45,155 --> 02:12:47,775
You sing very well, your maiesty.

1418
02:12:48,460 --> 02:12:51,293
His maiesty was a dream,
which was broken.

1419
02:12:52,183 --> 02:12:55,410
But, if the kings and
queens are happy..

1420
02:12:55,657 --> 02:12:59,732
By ioking about Raju's feelings,
Raju will sing.

1421
02:13:03,259 --> 02:13:07,125
On this auspicious occasion,
our special..

1422
02:13:07,572 --> 02:13:11,816
Guest, Raia will sing
you a song of happiness.

1423
02:13:25,003 --> 02:13:32,088
"The people who have thorns
in their fate."

1424
02:13:32,666 --> 02:13:40,666
"Shouldn't dream
about flower buds."

1425
02:13:43,958 --> 02:13:51,958
"Buds are the glory of palaces and.."

1426
02:13:52,066 --> 02:13:58,995
"Thorns are the glory of
the traveling paths."

1427
02:14:11,735 --> 02:14:17,944
"Raju had a dream, Raju
the king, the emperor."

1428
02:14:23,863 --> 02:14:26,877
"I didn't have a kingdom or a crown."

1429
02:14:26,933 --> 02:14:29,826
"But even then, I was a king."

1430
02:15:05,539 --> 02:15:13,539
"I was immature and illiterate."

1431
02:15:17,333 --> 02:15:25,333
"I saw faces, but I didn't see.." ♪

1432
02:15:26,818 --> 02:15:34,201
"But I didn't see the disguises
of disloyalty."

1433
02:15:58,171 --> 02:16:06,171
"I wouldn't be able to touch
even the dirt at her feet."

1434
02:16:09,984 --> 02:16:17,984
"Why did I love her? I am
just a single flower."

1435
02:16:21,106 --> 02:16:26,924
"I am just a single flower, she
was a rose of the spring."

1436
02:17:01,907 --> 02:17:09,907
"Congratulations to you, procession
come to your house."

1437
02:17:13,570 --> 02:17:21,570
"I talked about sadness by mistake."

1438
02:17:24,659 --> 02:17:30,622
"I talked about sadness,
please forgive me."

1439
02:18:12,807 --> 02:18:15,265
From where have to learnt to walk..

1440
02:18:15,306 --> 02:18:17,433
Away from the guests and
of respected houses?

1441
02:18:17,474 --> 02:18:19,339
Don't you think anything
about their respect?

1442
02:18:19,406 --> 02:18:21,931
I think about your respect
with their respect too.

1443
02:18:22,035 --> 02:18:23,900
Therefore I came away
from there silently.

1444
02:18:23,941 --> 02:18:26,205
Otherwise, how you announced
something..

1445
02:18:26,273 --> 02:18:28,400
Without asking me, even
I would announce something.

1446
02:18:28,734 --> 02:18:30,155
I don't accept this engagement.

1447
02:18:30,196 --> 02:18:32,422
- It is against my wishes.
- This is my decision.

1448
02:18:32,570 --> 02:18:35,233
And you know that my decisions
don't change.

1449
02:18:35,273 --> 02:18:37,207
Then how did you change
your decision..

1450
02:18:37,249 --> 02:18:38,951
- About my marriage to Raia?
- He wasn't worth it.

1451
02:18:38,975 --> 02:18:42,397
And what do you think? Is
this Kunwar worth it?

1452
02:18:44,362 --> 02:18:47,205
He knows that I love Raju.
He wishes to marry me..

1453
02:18:47,246 --> 02:18:50,050
Just because I am the
heir to this kingdom.

1454
02:18:50,504 --> 02:18:51,741
But listen to this.

1455
02:18:51,968 --> 02:18:55,937
I don't have any relation to that
kingdom, will and wealth.

1456
02:18:56,205 --> 02:18:57,525
Do you know what you are saying?

1457
02:18:58,383 --> 02:19:01,206
I am talking about leaving
the love and wealth..

1458
02:19:01,246 --> 02:19:05,578
Of my house and going
to my in-law's house.

1459
02:19:05,781 --> 02:19:07,041
In-law's house?

1460
02:19:07,500 --> 02:19:10,400
Can that orphan's house
be your in-law's house?

1461
02:19:10,441 --> 02:19:13,205
I and Raju have made that house.

1462
02:19:13,875 --> 02:19:17,543
Truth is it's base.
Love are it's walls.

1463
02:19:17,977 --> 02:19:19,734
Sacrifice for each
other is it's roof.

1464
02:19:19,775 --> 02:19:22,175
And peace of mind
is it's decoration.

1465
02:19:22,561 --> 02:19:23,920
You tell me now.

1466
02:19:24,103 --> 02:19:26,585
If that house is not worthy
to be my in-law's place..

1467
02:19:26,776 --> 02:19:28,216
Is his house worthy of being one?

1468
02:19:28,326 --> 02:19:31,464
He doesn't await me,
he awaits my wealth.

1469
02:19:31,540 --> 02:19:33,532
Wealth goes to the rich people.

1470
02:19:34,321 --> 02:19:36,422
And princesses marry kings.

1471
02:19:36,799 --> 02:19:39,233
Just like kings and queens
are history now..

1472
02:19:39,273 --> 02:19:42,834
Just like that, these status
things are just antique.

1473
02:19:43,233 --> 02:19:46,225
Just like the kings of yesterday
can't order anyone..

1474
02:19:46,273 --> 02:19:50,767
Just like that, today, every
man is king of his heart.

1475
02:19:51,109 --> 02:19:55,220
I am not trying to explain
it to you as a king..

1476
02:19:56,028 --> 02:19:59,322
But as an old father at this time.

1477
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:03,209
If a father doesn't
order his daughter..

1478
02:20:03,250 --> 02:20:06,264
And tries to fill happiness
in her life..

1479
02:20:07,167 --> 02:20:10,201
The father's dignity doesn't
fall low in that.

1480
02:20:12,529 --> 02:20:15,225
You aren't grandpa's grand
daughter. You are my fiancé too.

1481
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:17,887
- Let go of my hand.
- Never.

1482
02:20:20,358 --> 02:20:21,300
Wait..

1483
02:20:21,341 --> 02:20:24,333
- Princess. What are you doing?
- I told you.

1484
02:20:25,073 --> 02:20:27,300
This ioke will end with
the end of life now.

1485
02:20:27,341 --> 02:20:29,156
- Princess..
- Malti..

1486
02:20:50,935 --> 02:20:53,687
- You can't do this.
- Go away from here, your highness.

1487
02:20:53,728 --> 02:20:55,714
- No!
- For God's sake, go away from here.

1488
02:20:56,222 --> 02:20:58,489
No, you can't burn this house.

1489
02:20:58,984 --> 02:21:01,296
I have left everything I had for it.

1490
02:21:01,457 --> 02:21:04,119
You wish to make lies
into truth again?

1491
02:21:04,550 --> 02:21:06,337
I hate everything that is lies.

1492
02:21:06,444 --> 02:21:09,678
I hate this house, this
relation, this Raju.

1493
02:21:09,718 --> 02:21:11,969
Who forgot himself in
search of happiness.

1494
02:21:12,075 --> 02:21:14,585
And he became something else.

1495
02:21:15,699 --> 02:21:19,551
Today, let Raju and his
ambitions burn to ashes!

1496
02:21:19,705 --> 02:21:21,895
No. This is my house!

1497
02:21:21,984 --> 02:21:23,269
This is my Raju!

1498
02:21:23,582 --> 02:21:25,056
Raju and me had the same ambition.

1499
02:21:25,164 --> 02:21:28,966
No, Raju was orphan and alone.

1500
02:21:29,307 --> 02:21:32,839
He didn't have any happiness,
love or any house.

1501
02:21:33,193 --> 02:21:36,277
You have a house, you have a fiancé.

1502
02:21:36,343 --> 02:21:38,667
Raju, please try to understand.

1503
02:21:39,146 --> 02:21:42,343
Tonight's party, and your
arrival all of a sudden.

1504
02:21:42,410 --> 02:21:44,742
It played with my life.

1505
02:21:44,810 --> 02:21:47,677
The dreams which I was
trying to save..

1506
02:21:47,717 --> 02:21:50,678
The love for which I
was ready to lie too..

1507
02:21:50,743 --> 02:21:53,268
That was wiped within a moment.

1508
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:56,582
You said everything without
listening to me.

1509
02:21:56,657 --> 02:21:59,695
And before I could speak,
you said everything.

1510
02:21:59,810 --> 02:22:02,404
Raju, look into my heart.

1511
02:22:02,746 --> 02:22:06,584
It isn't a Princess's heart. It
is a human's and a woman's.

1512
02:22:06,625 --> 02:22:10,840
You want fake, princess.
Please go away from here.

1513
02:22:11,210 --> 02:22:12,934
No!

1514
02:22:13,278 --> 02:22:15,839
I have wiped every fake
thing of the princess.

1515
02:22:16,033 --> 02:22:18,836
Just thinking that this
house will be my life.

1516
02:22:19,013 --> 02:22:20,400
A house belongs to a woman.

1517
02:22:20,476 --> 02:22:24,281
And you don't have any right
to blot this house as fake.

1518
02:22:24,396 --> 02:22:26,671
- This house's base was kept on lies.
- No!

1519
02:22:27,195 --> 02:22:30,317
This house is my truth.
This is my support.

1520
02:22:30,581 --> 02:22:34,361
I will burn to ashes with
my husband any my house.

1521
02:22:34,880 --> 02:22:38,113
This is my fire test now.
Let me burn into ashes.

1522
02:22:38,210 --> 02:22:41,407
- Your highness..
- Call me Poonam.. Just Poonam.

1523
02:22:41,789 --> 02:22:44,449
I am your's. Just your's.

1524
02:22:45,099 --> 02:22:47,515
I am the truth of your love.

1525
02:22:48,908 --> 02:22:53,262
I am the decoration of your house.

1526
02:22:53,802 --> 02:22:58,337
Believe me, please believe me.

1527
02:24:24,246 --> 02:24:25,543
Poonam..

1528
02:24:26,926 --> 02:24:28,169
Poonam..

1529
02:24:30,723 --> 02:24:32,278
Poonam..

1530
02:24:36,008 --> 02:24:39,475
Believe me, Raju..

1531
02:24:40,273 --> 02:24:42,935
- Poonam..
- Raju.

1532
02:24:58,573 --> 02:25:02,176
Are you hurt? Are you all right?

1533
02:25:06,251 --> 02:25:07,935
I lost to you two.

1534
02:25:08,370 --> 02:25:10,018
Now, please come with me.

1535
02:25:10,590 --> 02:25:11,590
No.

1536
02:25:14,256 --> 02:25:16,281
We will settle our house here now.

1537
02:25:16,356 --> 02:25:18,756
But, your kingdom and your wealth..

1538
02:25:18,823 --> 02:25:21,257
Distribute it amongst the orphans.

02:25:22,257 --> 02:25:24,820

02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:30,845
Come on, Raju. We will save
our house. Come on.

1541
02:25:31,355 --> 02:25:37,321
"The thread of breaths may break."

1542
02:25:39,711 --> 02:25:43,169
"He thread of love won't break."

1543
02:25:44,284 --> 02:25:49,702
"Come on, we will hide and
speak a bit about love."

1544
02:25:49,909 --> 02:25:54,547
"We will speak about love.
We will meet each other."

1545
02:25:54,695 --> 02:25:58,970

1546
02:25:59,010 --> 02:26:06,383
