Andhra Pradesh is a matter of concern.

188

You need to dissertate on this.

189
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,960
Some of our ministers are
thinking of joining a new party, madam.

190
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,220
About joining that film star's party?

191
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,080
Why isn't our
Chief Minister doing anything?

192

-An other new CM in the north.
-How long will this circus go on?

Let's see.

Three Chief Ministers in just one year.

197
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,870
Kotla in November.

198
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,090
Do they think Telugu people are
spineless or we don't know how to rule?

199
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,620
We are not slaves under their feet.

200
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,480

My Telugu land is a mother
that fed the entire nation once.

217
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,330
But today? She was
begging for an ounce of food grains.

218
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,170
As a son to that
mother, I give you my word.

219
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,970
I promise that I will
provide kilo rice for just two rupees.

220
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,110
Honourable chairperson.

221
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,920
To all the poor people in this state.

222
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,150
We will provide kilo rice
for one rupee ninety paise only.

223
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,280
I feel very happy announcing this.

224
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,500
To all the farmers.

225
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,060
I will provide horse
power current just for fifty rupees.

226
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,970
I promise that on this soil.

227
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,540
Our government decided
to provide horse power current

228
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,350
for only fifty rupees to the farmers.

229
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,640
Congress ministers
are copying your schemes.

230
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,410
And stating them as their own schemes.

231
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,840
How do you react on this?

232
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,210
Telugu Desam's campaigning
itself is bringing such changes.

233
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,370
What if we come into power?

234
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Hail NTR! Hail NTR!

235
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,780
Madam.

236
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,230
According to our committee
report, the winds in Andhra Pradesh..

237
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,100
..started changing directions towards NTR.

238
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,540
We never lost a single
election in Andhra Pradesh till date.

239
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,970
What can just a film star do?

240
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,630
Madam.

241
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,370
He's not just a film star.

242
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,990
The people of Andhra.

243
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,170
They treat him like
he's one of their family members.

244
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,140
And even some believe him as their god.

245
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,770
His films talks on many social issues.

246
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,410
Like dowry system.

247
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,960
United family values.

248
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,640
Struggles of the labour and the farmers.

249
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,850
People don't look at him as a politician.

250
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,010
But as a social reformer.

251
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,850
We better take him seriously.

252
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,640
According to the electoral system.

253
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,290
The elections in Andhra will be..

254
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,030
..in August.

255
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,950
That means we have nine months of time.

256
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,990
What if we move the elections to January?

257
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,660
He will only have one month left.

258
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,470
In such a short time.

259
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,720
Even if the god himself comes
down to fight elections. He can never win.

260
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,810
So does NTR.

261
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,110
-Namasthe.
-Brother...

262
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,280
-He's an Eenadu reporter.
-Hello, sir.

263
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,880
-Tell me.
-The election date is announced, sir.

264
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,480
The elections that were supposed to happen
in August were moved forward by 8 months.

265
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,380
January 5th is the polling date, sir.

266
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,260
So we need to file
the nomination by December 11th.

267
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,410
What can we do in 13 days?

268
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,270
Good days were brought close.

269
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,360
We should thank Indira Gandhi.

270
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,550
I always felt that Indira
Gandhi would do something like this.

271
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,500
That's why...

272
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,970
I already got the candidates ready.

273
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,900
I came out of the same group
right? I know how she thinks.

274
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,700
Brother... I'll call
them if you can meet them once.

275
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,390
These are winning horses.

276
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,480
Ex-MLAs, ex-MPs, ZP chairmen...

277
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,500
There are anti-social people in this list.

278
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,480
Many of them are political thieves.

279
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,960
You don't know politics.

280
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,250
Rama Rao sir, these
people will definitely win.

281
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,730
I too fear the same.

282
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,110
These people will win.

283
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,130
Go and tell your Chalapathi Rao and batch.

284
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,500
Tell him that Rama Rao party
won't even get a deposit in your district.

285
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,390
-Sir. Please check this file.
-What Babu?

286
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,090
You're staying? Or leaving?

287
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,630
What sir?

288
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,280
There's a new party
right? Many of us seem interested.

289
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,530
That's what.

290
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,670
Whether I am in
student union or in politics.

291
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,580
I always work with discipline, sir.

292
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,550
What? If you are so disciplined.

293
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,730
If the party wants you to fight
against your father-in-law. Will you?

294
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,500
I am ready to fight
anyone if the party wants me to.

295
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,870
Even if it's my own father-in-law.

296
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,930
Sir.

297
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,830
As a candidate I may win or lose.

298
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,980
But I will never fail as a party member.

299
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,470

302
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,200
They are saying you are ready
to fight your own father-in-law!

303
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,970
Our party members are looking at me

304
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,920
like I am a
stranger, Reddy. This is not right.

305
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,210
Even if you are a party member. You
are the son-in-law to the opponent right?

306
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,360
Even if I am the son-in-law to the
opponent. I am a party member, right?

Don't know what happened!

340

Even there's no stone struck. But...

341
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,150
It seems like that tractor
is also going to the meeting.

342
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,850
As if you can travel in that tractor!

343

You named her very
nicely. Such a unique name.

346
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,520
You think so highly of my sister?

347
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,000
My brother-in-law named her.

348
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,270
What does your husband do?

349
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,540
-He had a rusted van.
-Ok?

350
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,000
He roams around in it.

351
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,640
-Sister, careful.
-Mom, are you Ok?

352
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,790
The roads are in very bad condition.

353
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,390
But not for long.

354
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,790
Our brother is coming to power.

355
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,220
These villages will shine soon.

356
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,470
Our country.

357
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,500
It had a population of 75 crores.

358
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,760
Means?

359
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,980
The property of our women who
faced death like labour, 75 crores times.

360
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,360
That's our country.

361
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,190
Sister you stay here.

362
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,120
Son-in-law. I'll just come.

363
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,420
Son-in-law.

364
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,670
That's why...

365
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,260
Among properties that can be inherited.

366
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,320
Telugu Desam decided to give
equal rights to the women in the family.

367
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,900
This is not one of my election promises.

368
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,730
All my properties.

369
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,540
I have divided them equally
among my sons and daughters.

370
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,400
I started the change from my own family.

371
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,630
This is for all those who call
me and love me like their brother.

372
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,440
For the women of my Telugu soil.

373
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,820
This is a gift from their
maternal family. My family.

374
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,740
Tarakam.

375
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,370
Oh my god!

376
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,020
Look at this wound!

377
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,920
It's nothing Tarakam.

378
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,290
Should you come all the way for this?

379
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,830
It's nothing?

380
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,890
How are you...

381
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,240
Travelling in this?

382
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,450
Why all this hardship?

383
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,270
For the taste of the
fruit, you have got to work hard.

384
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,840
That's not hardship.

385
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,380
That's duty.

386
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,950
When are you going to Tirupati?

387
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,880
Balakrishna's marriage
is on December 8 midnight.

388
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,910
After mid night, Ramakrishna's.

389
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,210
Can't you make it?

390
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,390
I don't think we can.

391
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,070
We had to plan the campaigning route.

392
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,620
I can't leave father-in-law. So...

393
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,590
How come dad
won't attend his own sons marriages?

394
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,190
He's there for our
marriage right? Leave him for now.

395
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,450
With just one day in between.

396
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,750
Two of our sons are getting married.

397
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,170
It's Ok if you can't attend.

398
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,750
This is public's time.

399
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,550
If I come back, it means I am wasting it.

400
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,490
In these designs, get two necklaces ready.

401
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,270
For both our daughters-in-law.

402
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,120
80 grams of gold for each.

403
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,770
160 grams in total.

404
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,150
This is for Balakrishna's Vasundhara Devi.

405
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,220
This is for Ramakrishna's Jayashri Devi.

406
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,340
How do they look?

407
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,870
They look very royal.

408
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,870
[Helicopter approaching]

409
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,380
Madam.

410
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,790
Whenever you visit our state.

411
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,090
It's like a festival for us.

412
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,620
We are expecting a lakh of crowd today.

413
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,920
That's good.

414
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,410
Today in Tirupati, he will come to know.

415
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,600
That the victory
will finally be Congress's.

416
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,500
Hail Lord Krishna.

417
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,710
Madam, he's our opponent.

418
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,430
But that's a cut out of Lord Krishna.

419
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,660
No madam. He is N.T.Rama Rao.

420
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,070
He also had his
last election rally in Tirupati today.

421
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,460
Sir, there's Prime
Minister's meeting going on in town.

422
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,480
So what?

423
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,210
You shouldn't enter until madam leaves.

424
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,410
This is our constituency.

425
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,840
-We'll get late.
-Yes.

426
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,150
-Today is the last day.
-Sir, please. We had our orders.

427
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,200
Please understand. We will lose our jobs.

428
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,780
Give your names.

429
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,080
After he took his oath,
he will give back your postings.

430
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,150
Sir, please listen to us.

431
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,090
There will be a security problem.

432
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,870
Security problem to this lion? Get lost.

433
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,270
I will stay here. You do your duties.

434
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,630
Father, we need to
stop the campaigning before 5.

435
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,930
-Yes uncle.
-Hari.

436
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,580
Indira Gandhi might be our opponent.

437
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,830
But she's a lady, who visited
our state as an honourable guest.

438
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,230
She's the Prime Minister.

439
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,660
Respecting her is our duty.

440
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,620
It's the culture of our Telugu land.

441
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,070
Brothers.

442
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,070
Sisters.

443
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,590
And all the lovely kids.

444
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,530
If the anniversary is of a human.

445
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,930
Or if it's of a nation.

446
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,080
It will always be an auspicious occasion.

447
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,830
It's a day of joy.

448
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,410
Tell me brothers.

449
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,260
-Whom will you vote for?
-[All at once]: Cycle.

450
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,750
Brother. As the cycle
symbol had no stand on it.

451
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,860
The whole village is arguing about it.

452
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,900
-What's your name?
-Penchalayya, brother.

453
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,140
See Penchalayya sir.

454
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,730
A cycle that stops, need a stand.

455
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,180
Our cycle will only move
forward. Why does it need one?

456
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,080
[People rejoicing]

457
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,990
Andhra Pradesh had always been with us.

458
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,970
Even during the emergency period.

459
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,060
Andhra Pradesh is with us.

460
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,300
I strongly believe that.

461
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,280
Even in this election.

462
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,040
Andhra Pradesh will help us.

463
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:38,830
What?

464
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,780
You started walking a new path.

465
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,530
Please be little careful, brother.

466
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,810
It'll be new, only until you take your
first step. But once you start walking.

467
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,230
Any difficult path
should come under our feet right?

468
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,420
No matter how many
parties come into existence.

469
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,920
Andhra Pradesh will
always be by Congress's side.

470
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,890
-NTR is conducting a meeting.
-Let's go.

471
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,190
Sit down.

472
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,050
Son. You have
turned so black and weak, son.

473
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,540
Forgot to ask. Where
are you voting from, son?

474
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,060
Tomorrow morning.

475
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,840
I'll shave my head
for Lord Venkateswara.

476
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,580
Will go back to Hyderabad with Tarakam.

477
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,210
And vote for our cycle symbol.

478
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,270
[People hailing]:
Long live NTR.

479
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,030
Nothing to worry about him mam.

480
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,380
NTR is not going to get
more than 30 to 40 seats mam.

481
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,940
-You telling the truth?
-Yes, madam.

482
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,420
-It's not a good sign.
-Madam.

483
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,250
-Take care of the polling.
-Yes, madam.

484
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,290
We had to win Andhra Pradesh.

485
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,690
Tarakam.

486
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,350
It's the first time in
India to use electronic voting...

487
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,690
Been with him since 30 years.

488
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,000
Can't understand him even today.

489
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,990
There's counting going on here
and he's playing with kids upstairs.

490
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,730
-Here grandpa.
-Wow. Fantastic!

491
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,060
Thank you.

492
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,460
Congress party candidate, P Sankara Rao...

493
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,760
Won over his next close
candidate, member of Telugu Desam party...

494
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,520
Puttapaaga Radha Krishna,
with a majority of 3003 votes.

495
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,210
Oh god.

496
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,810
-What is this?
-Oh my god!

497
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,670
Hail Pathala Bhairavi.

498
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,860
Dear king, should I
tell you the truth? Or the lie?

499
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,250
Superb. Next.

500
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,810
Grandpa will beat you up if you lie.

501
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,940
Look at me.

502
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,370
When the verdict
changes with each court.

503
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,900
Does it mean there's justice
still alive? Or is it dead, your honour?

504
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,130
Wow. Fantastic!

505
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,550
Rama Rao sir.

506
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,000
What Upendra? Tell me.

507
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,310
The first result is here.

508
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,820
In Shadnagar...

509
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,960
In Shadnagar?

510
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,260
Congress won.

511
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,810
With a difference of 3003 votes.

512
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,200
We lost the first seat.

513
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,260
The first movie that was
released with him as the hero.

514
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,530
Shavukaru. It didn't
do well in the theatres.

515
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,920
After that... From that day to this day.

516
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,810
Blockbusters haven't stopped.

517
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,740
Fans will come out for a movie star.

518
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,840
But not tears, right?

519
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,630
I saw everything from the driving seat.

520
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,200
It's not his fans who came to see him.

521
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,750

Feeling bad about the defeat?

591
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,940
Defeat and victory
are common issues in politics.

592
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,520
We need to analyse it and move
forward. There's no point in feeling bad.

593
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,310
Of course.

594
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,350
But these are not like
the previous elections, right?

595
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,890
Anywhere in this world... The
victor will be the reason for the victory.

596
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,830
And the defeated will
be the reason for the defeat.

597
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,620
But for the first time.

598
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,700
No matter who won or who lost.

599
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,090
The reason was common.

Right, sir.

603
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,110
I worked a lot for my constituency.

604
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,780
But everyone looked at my father-in-law.

605
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,640
And forgot the good I did.

606
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,920
Many great people
faced even bigger defeats.

607
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,130
I'll follow the constitution.

608
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,730
And the law.

609
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,360
To protect all the people and do justice.

610
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,910
So...

611
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,750
What's your position in the opposition?

612
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,890
Position?

613
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,930
I worked for the party. But
they looked at me as an opponent.

614
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,340
I am leaving these politics, sir.

615

622
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,080

624
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,290

our villages and into this assembly.

This assembly...

629
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,860
It's the Lord Brahma's holy slate,
on which our state's future is written.

630
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:45,400
It's a mother's womb that will
conceive our people's tomorrows.

631
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,520
If we waste even a half second here.

632
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,130
It's like throwing out food.

633
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,750
Ruling and opposition
parties, let's both work together.

634
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,890
For sure, CM sir.

635
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,660
-How are you?
-Good.

636
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:03,830
Your health is not good, right? I
panicked when dad called me home.

637
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,310
He called me too.

638
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,430
He called all the daughters.

639
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,900
Definitely not for me.

640
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,900

started from our family.

646

We are applying it over the entire state.

647
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,620
We are providing equal rights to
women, in their parents' properties.

648

Tarakam.

649
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,780
Are you happy?

650
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,130
You all hand it together.

651
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,840
Whatever the right might
be. It starts with the mother.

652
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,090
You had to be the first.

653
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,230
How will the change occur so suddenly?

654
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,630
This scrap was getting
collecting from 36 years.

655
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,950
Will it be so easy to change?

656
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:05,440
Nothing will happen
here. Let's go to Bhaskara Rao sir.

657
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,310
With self-respect.

658
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,770

women should live with pride.

first four rows are reserved for women.

Ok, sir.

-Do as I say.
-Ok, sir.

667

Brother is trying
something new. Let's cooperate.

668
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,580
Everyone talks outside the gate.

669
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,220
No one makes a sound in front of him.

670
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,430
Someone should tell him.

671
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,730
Or else he will be left alone,
with 6 crore people by his side.

672
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:40,980
Tell him?

673
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,060
No one in the party
have that kind of courage.

674
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,150
Leave them out.

675
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,540
A son-in-law can tell him.

676
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,840
My turn is done.

677
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,330
You try now.

678
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,870
Don't wait.

679
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,700
Keep an eye on their movements.

680
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,330
But they are ministers, sir.

681
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,680
So what?

682
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,750
A mistake is a mistake
even if our own people do it.

683
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,070
-Do as I say.
-Ok, sir.

684
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,350
Uncle.

685
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,730
I want to talk to you.

686
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,690
Tell me.

687
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,710
You are a straight forward person.

688
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,420
Great people like
you should be in politics.

689
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:14,000
But in politics, we need to
move forward, pulling everyone in.

690
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:20,640
Until now you might have
heard the pure claps of your fans.

691
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,090
And praises that
had no selfishness in them.

692
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,030
But here, every sound you hear
will have selfish reasons behind it.

693
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,820
You should listen to them.

694
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,630
But should do what you believe in.

695
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,670
As a politician.

696
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,200
I would never dare
to talk to you like this.

697
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,620

00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,710
Father?

701
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,800
Ask my son-in-law to come home.

702
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,250
Now?

703
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,740
Right now.

704
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,960
Tell him to start.

705
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,700
For the sake of SC and ST.

706
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,090
We need to build new wards.

707
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,800
-Bhaskara Rao.
-Yeah.

708
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,960
In every government organization.

709
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,130
There's lot of bribery accumulated.

710
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,920
We have to eradicate that.

711
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,520
We have to fulfil every promise we gave.

712
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,620
Ok, sir.

713
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,130
I have lot of experience.

714
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,450
I will take care of that.

715
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:42,990
You don't worry.

716
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,010
Party needs your
glamour in the coming days.

717
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,750
Act in one or two movies now and then.

718
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,920
Leave all this to me.

719
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,060
Eliminating
unemployment is a very major concern.

720
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,360
Reducing retirement age limit is enough.

721
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,610
Sir, your son-in-law is here.

722
00:40:58,850 --> 00:40:59,990
We are in a meeting here!

723
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,290
Ask him to come in.

724
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,100
You continue.

725
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,630
If you ask me there
is no better way than this.

726
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,850
-Hello, uncle.
-Come in, Babu.

727
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:10,980
Hello.

728
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,540
It seems you have a family meeting.

729
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,300
Talk with your son-in-law.

730
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,260
This day on, Chandrababu
Naidu is not just a family member.

731
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,130
He's a party member too.

732
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:31,980
I thought about it.

733
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,840
You are not with any party right now.

734
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,830
Telugu Desam needs you.

735
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,570
Sit down.

736
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,770
You continue.

737
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,460
To look for a solution
for unemployment problem.

738
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,750
Until Chennareddy government,
retirement age used to be 55 years.

739
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,640
He made it 58 years.

740
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:02,610
That will be beneficial for
people who already have jobs.

741
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,910
It creates 3 years
of postponement for the freshers.

742
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,980
So it's better we follow the old plan.

743
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,030
We can't take this decision so easily.

744
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,180
There will be a huge
backlash from the employees.

745
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,450
It's better we brainstorm on this first.

746
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,400
-That's not the point Naidu.
-We'll give pension to retired employees.

747
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,720
That's a relief.

748
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,580
But what will we give to the unemployed?

749
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,760
We had to give
them a job, but nothing else.

750
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,760
Do as I say.

751
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,850
Ok, sir.

752
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,330
Let's meet again.

753
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,240
Ok Rama Rao sir.

754
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:44,880
All the best, Naidu.

755
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:45,940
Thanks, sir.

756
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:53,940
Our party...

757
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:55,830
It's running dependent on my image.

758
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:59,460
But only when we all are
dependent on the party imagine.

759
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,000
It will continue to exist.

760
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:03,810
Party had to be robust,
down from the village level.

761
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,920
Make it into a strong organization.

762
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,920
From today, I am a
Telugu Desam party member.

763
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,980
I'll work like a servant to the party.

764
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,970
Very good.

765
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,470
From the Srisailam reservoir.

766
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:21,840
Up to Madras.

767
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,630
Through interlinked canals.

768
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,390
We can divert the waters.

769
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,930
Exactly 406 Kms, sir.

770
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,710
Well done Sri Rama Krishnayya.

771
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,580
I don't understand why we are
giving water to the neighbouring state.

772
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,650
How would public take this?

773
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,160
From the Srisailam reservoir.

774
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,250
Through Velugodu.

775
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,100
Somasila.

776
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,110
And Kandaleru reservoirs.

777
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,860
If water reaches Madras.

778
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,720
In Rayalaseema and Nellore.

779
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,620
5,75,000 acres of
barren land will get water supply.

780
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,550
This demands a lot of expenditure.

781
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,420
We don't have that kind of budget.

782
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:03,380
Tamil Nadu should bare
a bigger portion of the cost.

783
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,160
So... Drinking water for Tamil brothers.

784
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,640
And farm water for our people.

785
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,200
This project should
be named 'Telugu Ganga'.

786
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:14,450
Tamil Nadu should
remember our generosity forever.

787
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,270
[Commotion]

788
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,460
Sir. The situation is very serious.

789
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,650
Stop it.

790
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,750
What's all this?

791
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,200
What is happening here?

792
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,170
Sir. They all are very angry.

793
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,630
You please leave, sir.
We'll take care of this.

794
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,380
Officer...

795
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,630
Disperse!

796
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,810
-We will baton charge if you don't leave.
-Stop.

797
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,450
It's the same public who's paying you.

798
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,040
And it's the same public
who gave you that baton.

799
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,010
You should use it to
protect them. Not to punish them.

800
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:56,470
Enough of this, sir.

801
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:57,570
Please stop.

802
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,040
Enough of your acting.

803
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:02,510
We voted, hoping that you will better
our lives. You snatch our jobs instead!

804
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,750
At least let them do their jobs, sir.

805
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,140
-Hit us, sir. Hit us.
-Go on. Hit us.

806
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,540
-Hit us.
-Hit us, sir.

807
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,020
Please listen to me once.

808
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,690
What profit will I get from
reducing your retirement age?

809
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,190
You served the government all these years.

810
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,510
You are feeling bad that you'll
lose your jobs three years earlier.

811
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:23,060
But why don't you understand
that this will help the unemployed?

812
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,460
Moreover.

813
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:26,760
The government will pay all your pensions.

814
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,660
Create new jobs, sir.

815
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,530
Which constitution taught you to fire
existing employees to provide new jobs?

816
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,070
We plan our kids' marriages and
higher educations by the time we retire.

817
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,700
We live with budget sheets
of responsibilities on our heads.

818
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,630
Even for our cremation after death.

819
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,880
We started collecting one rupee at a time.

820
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,500
We are the middle class, sir.

821
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,290
If you take away our jobs at once.

822
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,820
Should we hang ourselves, sir?

823
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,520
What kind of justice is this, sir?

824
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:54,120
-Stop, sir. Don't leave.
-Answer us, sir.

825
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:55,240
Answer us, sir.

826
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,380
Answer us.

827
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,960
-Answer us and then leave, sir.
-Move.

828
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:00,580
Stop, all of you. I'll take care of this.

829
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,610
First you get inside. Leave, sir.

830
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,110
Please.

831
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:19,010
We did not expect
this from employees, sir.

832
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,920
We never thought that people who
loved you so much will insult you, sir.

833
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,100
They have no loyalty, sir.

834
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,470
You are doing a lot for them.

835
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:30,250
Your self-respect is your life.

836
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:31,440
They hit that today!

837
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,210
My self-respect grew with
their love in the first place.

838
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:38,360
If not them, who
else will have rights on it?

839
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,680
Let's think of what we should do now.

840
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:44,210
I'll do something to
get us out of this mess.

841
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:46,440
It's you who did all this right?

842
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,490
This retirement plan. It's your advice.

843
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,280
The thought is mine, I agree.

844
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,060
But the process is not mine right?

845
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:55,280
Even if the thought is great.

846
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,190
The implementation should also be proper.

847
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,290
It's not the right way to
point others for our mistakes.

848
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:02,420
What do you mean?

849
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:03,730
Is this my mistake?

850
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:06,570
We think of our posts as authorities.

851
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,540
If we look at them as
five-year jobs with monthly pay.

852
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:13,110
We would have understood them.

853
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,340
We made a mistake.

854
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,400
Let's take back our
decision on the retirement plan.

855
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:26,410
We should never make
mistakes like this again.

856
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:31,870
People from All India
Employees Union, Delhi are here.

857
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:33,720
I know some of them.

858
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,030
I'll talk to them and deal this smoothly.

859
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,320
Tarakam.

860
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:53,370
Tell me?

861
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:55,960
Happy Ugadi to you, Tarakam.

862
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,820
To you too.

863
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,270
Happy Ugadi.

864
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,940
Come Tarakam.

865
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:06,860
Tarakam.

866
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,600
To know about the
struggles of 6 crore people.

867
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,050
And to make their lives better.

868
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,410
Our constitution gave me just 5 years.

869
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:18,410
Only 1,825 days.

870
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,960
Every second from now on, I
had to be with utmost discipline.

871
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,440
Even what I eat and how much I
sleep should be a part of my purpose.

872
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,050
Even if I look in the mirror.

873
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,160
I should only see my determination

874
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,200
That's why.

875
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:36,510
I want to renounce worldly pleasures.

876
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:41,260
As the only reason to this life.

877
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,740
As a mother to my kids.

878
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,500
As my lawfully wedded wife.

879
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:46,900
I need your permission, Tarakam.

880
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:51,730
Do you like this idea?

881
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,130
For you and me...

882
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,230
Had there ever been two different likes?

883
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:02,580
♪Neither the mother nor the father.♪

884
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,350

904
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,440
-What's the difference?
-The minister sir...

905
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:35,010
-Hey, who are you?
-We are from the ACB.

906
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,500
I am the Labour minister. You know that?

907
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,190
The Chief Minister who sent us do.

908
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,850
Will divide larger
districts into smaller ones.

909
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,500
Every district will have an officer.

910
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,200
Every village will have it's own officer.

911
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,220
We'll expand administration
even to the villages.

912
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,350
This has to happen.

913
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,530
By taking advantage
of innocence and need..

914
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,460
Patel Patwari system which
supports slavery should be banished.

915
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,810
Telangana child should live
respectfully on Telugu land.

916
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:01,150
CS sir, get the papers ready.

917
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,550
Madam, the budget you gave us.

918
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:08,130
It's not enough for us.
Please think of something else.

919
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,120
Whatever I say here.

920
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,250
You all should just listen to that.

921
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:16,320
And that's final.

922
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:19,090
I am not your PA, madam.

923
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,670
To listen to whatever to say.

924
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,670
I am a CM.

925
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,740
I am the voice of 6 crore people.

926
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,510
Rama Rao sir.

927
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,320
You might be the voice of 6 crore people.

928
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:33,040
But me... I am the
voice of 60 crore people.

929
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,870
I am also one among those 60 crore voices.

930
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:38,480
It's not just your job to listen to me.

931
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,360
But it's your rightful duty.

932
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,530
Madam Prime Minister.

933
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:46,790
Everybody in our state calls you 'Mother'.

934
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,440
There is a saying that
even a mother won't feed her kid.

935
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:54,280
Until that kid actually
tells her that he's hungry.

936
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,260
But here, even after I ask you.

937
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,240
You are not going to care about them?

938
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:05,820
States are losing their rights.

939
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,320
And I am just
asking you those rights back.

940
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,430
Rights to the states are being suppressed.

941
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:18,050
If the states don't get back their rights.

942
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,940
This country's integrity
and strength will be lost.

943
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,100
You will have no rights here.

944
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,850
Ok, madam.

945
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,550
Until and unless I get by rights.

946
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,370
I won't keep my calm.

947
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,180
Or I would let Delhi keep it's.

948
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,700
Three Chief Ministers
walked out along with NTR.

949
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,590
For the first time ever, I saw
Jyothi Basu sir follow someone.

950
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,020
We had to stop this NTR.

-Allot special budget for health sector.
-Namasthe.

960
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,470
It may affect our treasury, sir.

961
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,010
A healthy life is everyone's basic right.

962
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:30,830
It's our duty to take care of it.

963
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:34,000
I went to him for a
small favour in Tourism.

964
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:37,420
He stood up kicking
his chair and said, 'Bloody fool'.

965
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,910
Have to answer for everything we do.

966
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,700
We can't even make
a small transfer happen.

967
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,270
I came here from Congress
only because you asked me to.

968
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,860
It's more comfortable there.

969
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:51,470
In politics.

970
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,540
It's not possible to be crystal clear.

971
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:56,460
To save our own selves.

972
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,720
We had to do few things.

973
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,090
He won't understand all that.

974
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,850
Ok... Let's do one thing.

975
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,460
Let's give him a
request letter from our side.

976
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:11,910
All of you, sign on an
empty paper and hand it to me.

977
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,050
I will take care of the remaining.

978
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,460
[Everyone agreeing]

979
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,310
As the 12th Governor of
our state, a Congress leader,

980
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,210
ex-CM of Himachal Pradesh,
Thakur Ramlal was appointed.

981
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,330
-Welcome, Rama Rao sir.
-Happy Independence Day.

982
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,700
And welcome to
Andhra Pradesh Governor sir.

983
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,430
Thank you Chief Minister sir.

984
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,800
Thank you.

985
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,410
Oh nice.

986
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,150
Beautiful.

987
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,390
Mother of Telugu.

988
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,880
Oh, Mother of Telugu?

989
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,460
-Nice.
-Let us work together for her sake.

990
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,600
Sure. Definitely.

991
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:44,850
He is Mr. Bhaskara Rao. My colleague.

992
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:47,680
Yes yes yes.

993
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,490
I know him.

994
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:51,290
-How are you Bhaskara Rao sir?
-Fine, sir.

995
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:52,600
You are the new one here.

996
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,230
But we are here for a long time right?

997
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,760

It's Ok. Tell him. Speak out.

1004
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:45,470
On the minister in your own government.

1005
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,000
You ordered an ACB ride.

1006
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:50,530
Everyone is thinking that you're
performing CM duties like it's a movie.

1007
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:53,480
We are ministers for namesake.

1008
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:55,400
Government schemes and decisions.

1009
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,480
We are knowing about
them from the newspapers.

1010
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,190
Rama Rao sir.

1011
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,110
Among the ruling party members.

1012
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,500
I am witnessing
insecurity feeling for the first time.

1013
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,620
Because of your methods.

1014
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,240
Even MLAs and
ministers are panicking, sir.

1015
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,540
You should think of what's
possible and what's not, right?

1016
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:15,030
Starting a party is possible.

1017
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:17,230
Asking for votes is possible.

1018
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,320
Winning seats is possible.

1019
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,120
But doing good is not possible?

1020
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:29,320
Every promise we did should come true.

1021
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,510
Everything we do should be transparent.

1022
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,270
Every scheme we thought of.

1023
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,310
Should be applied
according to the schematics.

1024
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,400
In time.

1025
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:37,470
On dot.

1026
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,160
Understand?

1027
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:44,790
-Understand?
-Yes, sir.

1028
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,960
-Sir.
-What?

1029
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:01,800
Malignant fibrous
histiocytoma cancer, sir.

1030
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,770
Yes, uncle. Final stages of cancer.

1031
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,700
-I saw all the reports.
-Better we take a second opinion.

1032
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:10,170
-Father!
-Father, what happened?

1033
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,710
Is it paining again?

1034
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,520
-Should I give a sorbitrate tablet?
-No.

1035
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:17,090
Uncle.

1036
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,070
Mom.

1037
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,510
Nothing will happen to you.

1038
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,490
We all are here right?
No matter how much it will cost...

1039
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,510
I too have money.

1040
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,030
But I have no time.

1041
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,780
-It's cancer right?
-Mom.

1042
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,130
Don't tell your dad.

1043
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,280
Your father...

1044
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,030
He has lot of courage.

1045
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,760
But more than that.

1046
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,020
He has love on me.

1047
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,850
Promise me.

1048
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:53,550
Brother-in-law.

1049
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:00,400
Tarakam.

1050
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:02,680
Nothing will happen to you.

1051
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,340
We are here for you.

1052
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:06,110
'We' will live long.

1053
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:09,920
Enquire where's the
best hospital to treat cancer.

1054
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,900
There are no hospitals for advanced
cancer treatment in our country, dad.

1055
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:16,530
What? Not even one hospital!

1056
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:19,960
If this is the situation
of NTR's wife. What about the poor?

1057
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,270
I am doing very fine.

1058
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,170
You please don't get excited.

1059
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:26,630
-Lokeshwari.
-Father?

1060
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,070
Tell us, which country
we need to take our Tarakam to?

1061
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:31,760
It's better you both go to America.

1062
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,270
You need to undergo a open heart surgery.

1063
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,220
Dr. Soma Raju suggested you right?

1064
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,510
That's fine. That's fine.

1065
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,090
We both will go
on a jolly trip to America.

1066
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:45,210
America?

1067
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:48,630
My heart should be healthy.

1068
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,180
Health is wealth.

1069
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,530
You both have a peaceful trip.

1070
00:58:58,090 --> 00:58:59,610
Leave these politics to me.

1071
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,280
I'll take care of the party.

1072
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:04,740
See you, Bhaskara Rao.

1073
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,490
Take care of my people.

1074
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:38,060
-Hello, madam.
-Hello, Rao sir.

1075
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,990
I heard that Sanjay believes in you a lot.

1076
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,340
Yes, madam.

1077
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,540
You too can believe in me.

1078
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,870
It's a good thing.

1079
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:07,750
See mom.

1080
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,860
Harmonium. You like playing it right?

1081
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:12,280
Why did you bring this now?

1082
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:14,020
Dad asked me to bring it, mom.

1083
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,360
Rama Rao sir.

1084
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,600
This is your second attack. Am I right?

1085
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,040
Yes. You are right.

1086
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,900
First attack occurred during
Justice Chowdary shooting time.

1087
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,040
Oh.

1088
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:26,140
Your condition is
very serious, just like madam's.

1089
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,420
Three arteries got
blocked inside your heart.

1090
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:30,950
And we are
astonished, how you have survived.

1091
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:33,990
-Mr. Venkateswara Rao.
-Sir.

1092
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:36,200
-Let's shift him to Texas.
-Sure, sir.

1093
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,850
Dr. Denton Cooley is there.

1094
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,130
-He's the world No.1 cardio surgeon.
-Ok, sir.

1095
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:42,310
Noori sir.

1096
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,220
What's our Tarakam's condition?

1097
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,680
Very advanced stage.

1098
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:50,580
If I should tell you the truth.

1099
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:51,800
Just few more days.

1100
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,660
She always thought that her life's
purpose is just to live for my happiness.

1101
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,750
She made me father for 12 children.

1102
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,810
There's no family
planning in those days right?

1103
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:08,590
More the merrier.

1104
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,700
Even then I told her
after Purandeswari was born.

1105
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,230
I said enough.

1106
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:14,730
She haven't listened.

1107
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:16,660
Our Balayya was born.

1108
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,320
Two years from then, our elder son died.

1109
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,080
She requested me that
we should have more kids.

1110
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,640
In hope that our son will come back to us.

1111
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,890
She's not just my wife.

1112
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,290
She's my mother who conceived me 12 times.

1113
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:34,130
-Dad.
-Uncle.

1114
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:35,250
Cool down.

1115
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,260
Do you know the difference
between then and now, doctor?

1116
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,940
At an age of 16.

1117
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,930
It's the same girl who sat by my
side during our wedding ceremony.

1118
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,840
Is now on the
hospital bed, fighting death.

1119
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:49,600
-Father!
-That's the only difference doctor.

1120
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:51,700
-Dad, please.
-I beg you.

1121
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:52,960
-Uncle.
-Dad, please be strong.

1122
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,920
-Please don't let my mother die.
-Uncle, please.

1123
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,650
-Dad, please be strong.
-Rama Rao sir.

1124
01:01:58,550 --> 01:01:59,700
We'll do our best.

1125
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:01,690
Be strong.

1126
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,540
Ramakrishna?

1127
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,890
You are staying here right?

1128
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:11,820
-Bring some pomegranates if you find any.
-Ok, mom. Will do.

1129
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:13,260
Had to give him it's juice.

1130
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,390
I searched the entire area.

1131
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:16,720
I haven't found any.

1132
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:18,420
See if you can.

1133
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:21,480
-Hello Dorothy.
-Hi.

1134
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:23,650
How is my wife responding to the therapy?

1135
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:25,680
She's did well Mr. Rama Rao.

1136
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,690
What did the doctors say, sister?

1137
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,750
They'll give radiation
treatment to mom, here in New York.

1138
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:38,210
Heart surgery for dad, in Houston

1139
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,970
Me and Ramakrishna will stay here.

1140
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,110
You go with dad.

1141
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:43,880
Ok.

1142
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:45,440
What's happening?

1143
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,830
Won't you be with me?

1144
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:57,040
I'll spend this entire day with you.

1145
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:04,590
A whole day with me!

1146
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:06,850
It's been a really long time.

1147
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:10,360
Worries and wealth.

1148
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,230
Aspirations and anger.

1149
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:14,050
Kids and their marriages.

1150
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:16,280
Now these illnesses and ailments.

1151
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,950
How many days it has been
since we talked about ourselves, Tarakam.

1152
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:24,710
Let's take this as an
opportunity god gave us.

1153
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,860
Among the feelings we
have missed, let's share at least few.

1154
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:31,200
Ah, yes.

1155
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,840
Sing my favourite song
from Chandirani movie.

1156
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:37,540
-Oh Star. Oh Moon?
-Yes.

1157
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,910
You too like this song?

1158
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,960
For you and me, had there
ever been two different likes, Tarakam?

1159
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:50,590
♪ Oh star!♪

1160
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:53,930
♪ Why are you smiling looking at me?♪

1161
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:57,860
♪ Oh star!♪

1162
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,550
♪ Why are you smiling looking at me?♪

1163
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:07,200
♪ You are the moon who sprinkles beauty♪

1164
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:13,330
♪ You are the moon who sprinkles beauty♪

1165
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:16,230
♪ Oh moon! O o..♪

1166
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:22,080
♪ That star! Will smile
by looking at you♪

1167
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:38,370
-The systems here are very good.
-Uncle.

1168
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:39,940
Back at our place.

1169
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:42,810
We had to update the equipment like this.

1170
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,650
Good evening,
Mr. Rama Rao. How are you today?

1171
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:47,130
Fine doctor.

1172
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,900
Are you ready for the surgery?

1173
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,120
Yes. I am ready.

1174
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,710
Relax. Relax.

1175
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,510
Ok, sir. See you later.

1176
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:55,300
With out the Chief Minister.

1177
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:58,270
Ministerial Council Meeting
shouldn't happen. That's not protocol.

1178
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:00,350
Many out of protocol
things are happening here.

1179
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:01,780
-What I am saying..
-Keep quiet, sir.

1180
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:03,780
Bhaskara Rao sir. I need to talk to you.

1181
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:06,530
Just with me?

1182
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,870
Or can my people also stay?

1183
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:09,690
Your people!

1184
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,600
Anyone from party can stay.

1185
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:16,480
Let's go to your chamber?

1186
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:17,950
It's Ok. Tell me.

1187
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:23,460
What's the link between Old City
clashes and the Finance Minister?

1188
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:27,180
We don't understand why you
keep calling for press meets like these.

1189
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,020
I don't understand
why are you asking all this?

1190
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,800
What's the link between
you and this government?

1191
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:35,780
You are not even a counsellor!

1192
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:39,180
I may not be in the
government. But I am in the party right?

1193
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,970
I have the right to ask.
And the need to inquire.

1194
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:43,950
We are also in the party.

1195
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:45,710
We too have rights.

1196
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:48,780
Should we ask your
permission for the press meets?

1197
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:51,320
We are talking about the
system and you taking it personally?

1198
01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:53,450
System? What do you mean by system?

1199
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:54,980
Look at the Congress party.

1200
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,000
Everyone there have their own democracy.

1201
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,520
Do you think regional
parties should follow monopoly?

1202
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:02,420
There will be a
protocol even in democracy.

1203
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:05,530
Don't talk without knowing
difference between discipline & monopoly.

1204
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:07,480
What do you mean?
We don't have any discipline?

1205
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:08,790
Listen to me.

1206
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,780
This Ministerial Council
Meeting will arise many complications.

1207
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,760
Ministerial Council
Meeting with out the CM?

1208
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:15,020
How can you call for that?

1209
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,500
Is Bhaskara Rao the Chief Minister?

1210
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:17,960
Is Bhaskara Rao the Chief Minister?

1211
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,440
Listen.

1212
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:27,560
There's no need to answer you.

1213
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,030
Everyone in the party is unsatisfied.

1214
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:34,070
He might be the glamour of this party.

1215
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,680
But I am the grammar of it.

1216
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:39,550
Even with enough experience
and qualification for the CM post.

1217
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,460
I left everything for the party.

1218
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:43,140
Leave all these aside.

1219
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:45,020
I need to sit and discuss with him.

1220
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:46,490
When is he coming?

1221
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:48,400
It's Ok.

1222
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:49,680
We both will take care of this.

1223
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:51,360
You don't over think.

1224
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,760
Something is happening here.

1225
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,440
Bhaskara Rao visited Delhi.

1226
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,840
PCC Madan Mohan is
meeting the new Governor frequently.

1227
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,070
Intelligence Chief is not here.

1228
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,620
He came to America with you guys.

1229
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:30,110
There's no information here.

1230
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:32,970
I already told Apparao to stay there.

1231
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:35,040
-He hasn't listened.
-I smell something.

1232
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:38,170
I know about Indira Gandhi.

1233
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:42,090
She'll do everything for the sake
of her party and loss of her opponents.

1234
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,210
Uncle shouldn't take
tension in this situation.

1235
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:47,530
But we all should stay alert.

1236
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,920
It's better he come
back as early as possible.

1237
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,260
Ok, Babu.

1238
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:26,660
Yeah, Bhaskara Rao.

1239
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:29,160
Get well soon.

1240
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:30,770
You need rest.

1241
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:33,920
Read it.

1242
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,910
It's the inner feeling of
some ministers, including me.

1243
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,060
I'll take leave.

1244
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:53,840
I am one among the party founders.

1245
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:56,980
You think that this party came
into power only because of you.

1246
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:59,220
But for someone who
had no experience at all.

1247
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:01,030
With what trust did people vote for you?

1248
01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:04,500
With the trust that a matured
politician like me is by your side.

1249
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:07,240
With a person like me...
When fights broke out in the Old City.

1250
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:09,090
To warn me not to
visit the curfew areas.

1251
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:12,400
What right did the General
Secretary have? How dare he?

1252
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:18,450
I don't have the power to
call for the Ministerial Council Meeting.

1253
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:20,370
A junior minister said so.

1254
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,030
Who gave him that courage?

1255
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:25,670
Even my press meets are being judged.

1256
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,680
Isn't it the lenience
you gave your son-in-law?

1257
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:31,590
We believe that we
cannot travel with you anymore.

1258
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:33,990
If you don't change
your dictatorial behaviour.

1259
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,100
We are not
responsible for the outcomes of it.

1260
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:43,770
There's a crocodile
roaming in the skin of a minister.

1261
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,110
This is not a request letter.

1262
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:51,860
An admonition letter, sent by hate.

1263
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:02,140
I am expelling Bhaskara
Rao from the Ministers Council.

1264
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,720
Get the paperwork ready.

1265
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,330
The termination letter
haven't reached me yet.

1266
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:14,380
I am not the kind of
man who will sit and wait for it.

1267
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,000
I'll go against it.

1268
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:19,970
To let him know about
the intolerance in the party.

1269
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,560
I took signatures from the MLAs.

1270
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:31,380
Let's change the topmost page.

1271
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,330
Intolerance will turn into distrust.

1272
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:36,160
Don't know how many members support him.

1273
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,510
Upendra sir. How many are here right now?

1274
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:40,370
Ministers and MLAs combined.

1275
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,660
Can be 90 to 95, easy.

1276
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,000
A need to build a camp occurred.

1277
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,990
Call our MLAs from all
the districts, as early as possible.

1278
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:56,240
The number game starts in few days.

1279
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:59,360
That won't suffice. Another
70 people are coming for dinner.

1280
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:02,020
Rukmangada Rao. How many
rooms do we have in Ramakrishna studios?

1281
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,520
-How many rooms in the studio?
-30. What for?

1282
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:08,320
We need to arrange stay for 180 members.

1283
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,180
-That many!
-Yes.

1284
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:12,610
It will do. We also
have four floors right.

1285
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,020
What's happening?

1286
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:15,300
For nothing to happen.

1287
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:16,650
You make the arrangements.

1288
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,400
Letter of distrust.

1289
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:26,450
Request letter from our
MLAs to CM Rama Rao sir.

1290
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,510
Now it will be the letter of distrust,
that is being sent to the Governor.

1291
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:41,910
Meet me later.

1292
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,640
Madam...

1293
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:48,290
Bhaskar Rao sir has sent
the letter of distrust to the Governor.

1294
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:51,540
This is the correct time to
take the strength into our hands.

1295
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,530
Rajashekar Reddy and Madhan
Mohan sir met the Governor, madam.

1296
01:11:58,210 --> 01:11:59,950
Do whatever is required.

1297
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:20,270
He likes Subhash Chandra Bose a lot.

1298
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:22,690
He like his salute even more.

1299
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:25,780
Don't know what you're feeling.

1300
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:29,010
But for me, it feels like
one flag is saluting another.

1301
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,860
Hello.

1302
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:51,440
92 MLAs of my party are here with me, sir.

1303
01:12:53,150 --> 01:12:54,170
Good.

1304
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:56,390
57 from Congress.

1305
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:02,170
Combining MIM and the independents MLAs...

1306
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:04,500
-It's 158.
-Correct.

1307
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,620
Bhaskara Rao sir,
these numbers seem like magic.

1308
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:10,440
This is the power public gave us.

1309
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,640
People are my rulers.

1310
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:15,210
This second life god gave me.

1311
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,070
Is dedicated to the service of my people.

1312
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:17,980
Again and again.

1313
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:19,700
What's your constituency?

1314
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,540
-What?
-He's asking your constituency. Tell him.

1315
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:25,250
-Oh, consistency...
-Not consistency. It's constituency.

1316
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:27,210
Say properly.

1317
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:31,660
Mine?

1318
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:35,480
I am not here to play politics.

1319
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:39,320
I am here to live at your doorstep
and stop any bad that tries to enter.

1320
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:41,580
Jai hind.

1321
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:48,600
The minute I get the power.

1322
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,620
Every bloody sheep
will come running to me.

1323
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,050
What you said is right.

1324
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,780
Have you practiced your oath?

1325
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:58,880
Governor sir. I can
recite it with my eyes closed.

1326
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:00,660
Just wait a little more.

1327
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:03,510
My order would have
reached the parade ground by now.

1328
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:30,340
The Governor sent a message,
asking the Chief Minister to resign.

1329
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,920
Governor is about
to dissolve our ministers council.

1330
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:53,440
He asked you to resign.

1331
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,740
[People screaming]:
Hail NTR.

1332
01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:27,700
Brothers. Brothers! Listen to me.

1333
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,100
Sorry, sir.
You have no permission to enter.

1334
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:33,790
There's no need of
permission to question a wronging.

1335
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:36,230
I am here to prove
my people's trust in me.

1336
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:38,620
There are 168 MLAs here.

1337
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:42,020
That's people of 168 constituencies.

1338
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:43,650
It's your duty to give us a way in.

1339
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:47,080
We got orders, not to
send you into the Raj Bhavan.

1340
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,850
Until they take back my
resigning order, I am not backing off.

1341
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,740
And I am not leaving Raj Bhavan either.

1342
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:03,240
Ok. They have permitted only 15 members.

1343
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:05,050
That too only MLAs.

1344
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:15,710
Mr. Bhaskara Rao has
submitted a list of 160 MLAs.

1345
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:19,580
And he also has a letter of
support from the Congress party.

1346
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:23,600
So... How will you
rule with only just 15 MLAs?

1347
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,470
You are making a mockery of our democracy.

1348
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:29,970
I have come to Raj Bhavan with 168 MLAs.

1349
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:33,220
But you insisted only
15 of them to come in.

1350
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,690
The truth is standing outside your gate.

1351
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:38,810
Please do the head count.

1352
01:16:41,210 --> 01:16:43,380
If we stay here for
long, the police might arrest us.

1353
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:46,470
Even in the control room, all
the MLAs should be in our control.

1354
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:47,990
Ok, sir.

1355
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:50,920
Take responsibility of the
MLAs in your corresponding districts.

1356
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:52,330
You take care of your MLAs.

1357
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,680
You take care of your MLAs.

1358
01:16:53,730 --> 01:16:55,010
And you take care of your MLAs.

1359
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:56,360
Listen to me very carefully.

1360
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,450
Not even one MLA should go missing.

1361
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,510
Everyone should come
back to Ramakrishna studios.

1362
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:04,580
But I am not here to do
whatever you say, Mr. Rama Rao.

1363
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:06,480
Yes. It is evident.

1364
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,320
You are here to follow some..

1365
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:10,520
..unconstitutional
instructions from Delhi.

1366
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:12,920
I am sorry, Mr. Rama Rao.

1367
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:15,290
I don't have time for this.

1368
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,190
Because I have to go
for new Chief Minister's..

1369
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,800
..Swearing-in ceremony.

1370
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,480
CM?

1371
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:24,700
Who is the CM?

1372
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:26,590
For the people, by the people.

1373
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,640
I was elected as the Chief Minister.

1374
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,080
I am the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.

1375
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:35,720
So you have decided not to resign!

1376
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,080
Then I have to dissolve your cabinet.

1377
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,840
-How can you do that?
-How can you dissolve?

1378
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:42,080
How can you!

1379
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:44,880
There should be some
justice in what you do.

1380
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:46,660
You please talk.

1381
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:48,640
-What you're doing is wrong.
-No.

1382
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:49,990
This is not the right process.

1383
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:52,250
We will not leave this.
We'll fight for the justice.

1384
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:54,360
What nonsense is this?

1385
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:55,660
You can not do this.

1386
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,080
Is this the way you
behave with a Governor!

1387
01:17:58,460 --> 01:17:59,680
I'll get you all arrested.

1388
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:01,150
Marshalls.

1389
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,980
[MLAs shouting in anger]

1390
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,800
You are doing a mistake.

1391
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:06,530
This is not fair, Governor sir.

1392
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,610
This is not fair!

1393
01:18:10,450 --> 01:18:11,870
Down down Governor's autocracy!

1394
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,590
Hail NTR.

1395
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:16,620
Hail NTR.

1396
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:18,290
Hail NTR.

1397
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,480
Hail NTR.

1398
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:24,460
Down down Governor's autocracy!

1399
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,190
Down down Governor's autocracy!

1400
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:27,970
Down down Governor's autocracy!

1401
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:30,060
Down down Governor's autocracy!

1402
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:35,710
Bhaskara Rao sir.

1403
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,040
Are you ready to take oath?

1404
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:44,520
With Raj Bhavan as the witness.

1405
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:46,050
They murdered democracy.

1406
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:50,110
They just rewrote people's decision.

1407
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:54,860
They dissolved our Telugu people's future.

1408
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,590
I, Bhaskara Rao.

1409
01:18:57,010 --> 01:18:58,430
I, Bhaskara Rao.

1410
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:00,500
Solemnly affirm that
I, according to the laws..

1411
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,650
Solemnly affirm that
I, according to the laws..

1412
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:04,580
..shall be
faithful to Indian Constitution.

1413
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,520
..shall be
faithful to Indian Constitution.

1414
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:10,300
Come, sir. Back off.

1415
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:11,630
Hail NTR.

1416
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:12,840
Hail NTR.

1417
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:14,190
-Back off.
-Stop.

1418
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:15,920
Don't give in to the pressure.

1419
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:18,000
We need to keep
going with the same energy.

1420
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,900
The imperialism of India.

1421
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,960
The imperialism of India.

1422
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,480
Hail NTR.

1423
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:29,680
Hail NTR.

1424
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:31,390
Don't give into pressure.

1425
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,890
Down down Governor's autocracy!

1426
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,530
Down down Governor's autocracy!

1427
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:36,950
As the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.

1428
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:39,030
I'll perform my duties with devotion.

1429
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:41,040
I'll perform my duties with devotion.

1430
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:45,830
Don't forget what I said.

1431
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:52,790
I swear, with god as my witness.

1432
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:55,290
I swear, with god as my witness.

1433
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,510
Everybody, come
back to Ramakrishna studios.

1434
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:05,760
Congratulations.

1435
01:20:05,830 --> 01:20:06,880
Thank you, sir.

1436
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:17,790
Sir Bhaskara Rao, took his oath
as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.

1437
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:22,600
NTR and the MLAs
who stood in his support..

1438
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:25,160
..were arrested. And
were shifted to the control room.

1439
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:26,700
In protest of his arrest.

1440
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:29,970
As the party members
broke into a violent agitation.

1441
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:32,210
The police used
baton charge to disperse them.

1442
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:34,310
[All shouting]:
Hail NTR.

1443
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:52,700
Lokeshwari.

1444
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:56,350
You had to be at the Madras
cancer hospital with your mother right?

1445
01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:57,600
Mom's not coming.

1446
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:00,280
She's very stubborn, that
she's won't go without seeing you.

1447
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,740
We are getting late for the flight.

1448
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:06,730
-With help of President's trusted person.
-Mom.

1449
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:09,260
-Dad is here.-Governor Ram Lal.

1450
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:12,570
-Bhaskara Rao have done all this.
-You saw him right? Let's go now.

1451
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:14,040
Many are opposing him.

1452
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:16,940
People's organizations
were protesting strongly against him.

1453
01:21:19,690 --> 01:21:20,720
Tarakam.

1454
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:24,190
Are you worried about me?

1455
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,860
You please start.

1456
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:31,340
If you are good. I would
obviously be good, no matter where I am.

1457
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:33,570
If you are good.

1458
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,550
I will live in you, even after my death.

1459
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,010
Tarakam!

1460
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:41,490
I am hearing things
in the NEWS these days.

1461
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:45,630
I stopped to see you once.
And wanted to tell you something.

1462
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:49,680
Do you remember?

1463
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:52,740
One day, Vijaya Nagi Reddy and you..

1464
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,450
..got into a heated discussion.

1465
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,340
When he tried to pull
you away from the public.

1466
01:21:57,230 --> 01:21:59,620
You even left the movie and walked out.

1467
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:04,240
I said, let's buy some buffaloes.

1468
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:07,310
Everything will be fine if
you get back on your cycle.

1469
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,180
It's the same even now.

1470
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:14,310
No one can take you away from our people.

1471
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:18,910
You get on your cycle again.

1472
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:24,200
This is a great gift the god gave you.

1473
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:25,930
Until this day.

1474
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:29,090
Only Telugu people knew who NTR is.

1475
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:30,940
But now?

1476
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,170
The entire world will know about you.

1477
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:37,430
Son Hari!

1478
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:39,820
-Hari.
-Hari.

1479
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:41,800
Mom.

1480
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,690
Dad is going back into the public.

1481
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:45,850
Go along with him.

1482
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:48,300
Mom.

1483
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:50,280
Dad underwent open heart surgery.

1484
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:51,940
If he goes into the public...

1485
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,620
His people are his greatest
strength. He has to go to them.

1486
01:22:58,220 --> 01:22:59,300
Listen.

1487
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:01,770
I am going to the hospital.

1488
01:23:02,930 --> 01:23:04,370
You go safe.

1489
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,320
And when you come
back, come as a Chief Minister.

1490
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:07,840
Until then.

1491
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:09,270
Even if the death comes to me.

1492
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:10,930
I'll make it stand at the doorstep.

1493
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:45,500
On last August 15th.

1494
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:47,210
There's a new Governor.

1495
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:49,220
On this August 15th.

1496
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,660
They dissolved our government.

1497
01:23:52,530 --> 01:23:54,670
This is a conspiracy
being planed over a year.

1498
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,270
I, Farooq Abdullah.

1499
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,720
Used to be CM of Jammu and Kashmir.

1500
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:01,560
But our great mother..

1501
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,860
..tore my party into pieces.

1502
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,460
And with the help of Congress.

1503
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:09,560
Whatever happened in Kashmir, 45 days ago.

1504
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:11,610
The same got repeated
in Andhra Pradesh today.

1505
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:14,210
Karnataka will face
the same thing tomorrow.

1506
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,800
In our democratic India.

1507
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:18,760
Should every state be
under the hand of Congress party?

1508
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,700
Both the communist parties.

1509
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:22,600
Will stand by NTR sir.

1510
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:24,460
They will see the end of Indira Gandhi.

1511
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:34,050
Not of the same language.

1512
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:35,720
Not from the same state.

1513
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,110
Doesn't even belong to
the same political party.

1514
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:41,760
But today, we all stand
on the same stage. Why?

1515
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:45,450
Because of the evil change that
overpowered your verdict through the vote.

1516
01:24:45,530 --> 01:24:48,250
If at all this state had to
bend its knee and bow its head.

1517
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:51,180
There can be nothing more
shameful about this country.

1518
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:52,690
Here they are.

1519
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,860
Bharathi Devi. Is that you?

1520
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:58,190
Sir. No one brought us here by force.

1521
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,250
Do you want to do that to us? Tell me.

1522
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:04,610
No one here is staying on force.

1523
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:05,840
Enquire if you want to.

1524
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:08,910
MLAs should be in
the secretariat, right? Why are they here?

1525
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:12,460
Rama Rao sir should be in a
studio. But he went to secretariat right?

1526
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:13,800
He's not in the secretariat now.

1527
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:15,030
That's why MLAs are here.

1528
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:16,070
You too sit.

1529
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:17,620
Food blessed by Rama. Have some.

1530
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,700
We need to question
this autocracy, very strongly.

1531
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:21,820
We need to bring down this dictatorship.

1532
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:24,330
My heart might stop, fighting this war.

1533
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:27,130
But I'll even leave
my last breaths for you.

1534
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,050
Until the justice wins.

1535
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,790
Until the people's verdict wins.

1536
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:32,950
Until these vultures descend the throne.

1537
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:34,620
This war won't stop.

1538
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:38,450
[People shouting]
Long live democracy.

1539
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:40,520
The Delhi moved me from my place.

1540
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:42,520
Now it's my turn to shake it by the roots.

1541
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:46,470
On their won lands,
I will prove my majority.

1542
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:48,950
Brother!

1543
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:52,800
I'll make our Telugu courage,
burn like wildfire across the country.

1544
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:55,020
Take this tablet.

1545
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:58,090
Even I want the justice to win.

1546
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:03,160
Naidu sir.

1547
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:04,350
Please be little careful.

1548
01:26:13,150 --> 01:26:15,530
It's not safe to leave
the MLAs here in Hyderabad.

1549
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:17,200
We must shift them at once.

1550
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:22,620
It's not the emotion of a single region.

1551
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:26,530
I'll let them that this is the anger of an
entire nation now and demand our rights.

1552
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:30,170
The slavery, Governor is enforcing on us.

1553
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,660
I'll expose it right
in front of the President.

1554
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:33,700
Brother.

1555
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:38,830
On to... Delhi.

1556
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:40,400
[People repeating]:
On to Delhi

1557
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:42,360
[People repeating]:
On to Delhi

1558
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,180
[People repeating]:
On to Delhi

1559
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:02,800
Yes, sir.

1560
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:06,140
All the MLAs are
coming to Delhi in the AP express.

1561
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,820
Do something to stop
them before they reach you.

1562
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:10,730
Thank you.

1563
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:14,250
Don't you fear the
Chief Minister's orders?

1564
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:17,110
You failed to get
even one MLA out of the studio.

1565
01:27:17,790 --> 01:27:19,910
They all were there at their own will.

1566
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:22,120
Oh, Ok.

1567
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:25,270
Then me too, at my own will.

1568
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:28,180
Transferring you from
here, to the traffic police.

1569
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:29,450
Get out.

1570
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,580

01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:45,290
Let's get it. Let's
show them our strength.

1744
01:37:45,490 --> 01:37:47,460
It's not just the
injustice that happened with me.

1745
01:37:47,490 --> 01:37:50,700
This is the injustice that happened
with the trust of 6 crore Telugu people.

1746
01:37:50,830 --> 01:37:52,910
Let's show them the anger of Telugu blood.

1747
01:37:53,150 --> 01:37:55,390
Let's shake Delhi throne by its roots.

1748
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:58,490
For the Motion of
confidence, of CM Bhaskara Rao.

1749
01:37:58,630 --> 01:38:01,830
The Assembly will
gather on 11th of this month.

1750
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:05,610
The new Governor,
Shankar Dayal Sharma ordered so.

1751
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:09,420
On this note, to
support Mr.Bhaskara Rao once again.

1752
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:11,990
Congress party took a decision.

1753
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:15,730
On the other hand, in the
religious war occurred in Old City.

1754
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:19,680
-Death of 4, had become a political issue.
-Come. Come fast.

1755
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:22,650
They will talk nonsense, to
frustrate and push us out of our limits.

1756
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:25,600
They will create an issue
somehow and try to dismiss the house.

1757
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:28,610
-Be careful.
-We shouldn't answer them back?

1758
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:29,840
No matter what they say.

1759
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:33,300
-It's Ok. These people will keep calm.
-Don't react.

1760
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:35,020
But NTR sir will keep his pride.

1761
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:36,890
Did you ask him to keep calm too?

1762
01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:39,560
No need.

1763
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:42,700
But NTR itself means emotion.

1764
01:38:43,950 --> 01:38:45,180
Let's see what happens.

1765
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:50,570
-Long live...
-NTR...

1766
01:39:20,410 --> 01:39:22,700
-[People demanding]: We need a debate.
-Remember this.

1767
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:24,190
Our target is NTR.

1768
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:26,240
It's his pride, that
brought him to the assembly.

1769
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:29,160
-Use the same pride to kick him out.
-Yes, sir.

1770
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:32,540
One little mistake, and we can kick
him even out of the Motion of confidence.

1771
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:05,200
Naidu sir. I'll tell him.

1772
01:40:06,410 --> 01:40:08,810
Brother. This is
our seat. Please sit here.

1773
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:12,820
[MLAs shouting]:
Hail NTR.

1774
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:17,840
[MLAs shouting]:
Hail Bhaskara Rao.

1775
01:40:46,450 --> 01:40:48,430
Let's go for condolence
deciding debate for today.

1776
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:51,290
Honourable chairperson.

1777
01:40:52,180 --> 01:40:53,230
Today in the house...

1778
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:56,770
Voting on the Motion of
confidence should be the only agenda.

1779
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:00,960
Hello, Speaker sir.

1780
01:41:01,070 --> 01:41:02,960
Under these
situations, at this point of time...

1781
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:04,430
Should we talk about Confidence?

1782
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:08,050
5 innocent people were
killed on the streets of Old City.

1783
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:09,890
And we shouldn't talk on that?

1784
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:11,970
[MLAs demanding]:
We need a debate on that issue.

1785
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:15,530
Debate on that issue

1786
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:17,480
What are you talking? Sit down.

1787
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:19,050
I said, sit down.

1788
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:24,060
Please. Please sit down.

1789
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:25,390
-Honourable chairperson.
-Sit.

1790
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,160
-One minute. Please sit.
-This debate..

1791
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:29,060
..is being diverted with wrong intentions.

1792
01:41:29,230 --> 01:41:32,540
It's not religion that caused deaths
in the Old City, Honourable chairperson.

1793
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,120
It's politics.

1794
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:35,320
Bloody politics.

1795
01:41:35,370 --> 01:41:38,100
[MLAs disapproving]
You're diluting the main issue.

1796
01:41:38,150 --> 01:41:39,590
Please. Please, please.

1797
01:41:39,630 --> 01:41:41,260
Honourable chairperson.

1798
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:44,370
Not just for the Old City.

1799
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,950
If this entire state should get justice.

1800
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:49,040
There should be a
leader sitting in the assembly.

1801
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:50,750
To decide who that leader is.

1802
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:52,510
We need Motion of confidence.

1803
01:41:52,550 --> 01:41:54,660
-That's the only way.
-Please.

1804
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:57,220
[Commotion]
Sit. Please sit.

1805
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,370
We already have a
leader. How can you talk like that?

1806
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:01,240
I said sit down!

1807
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:03,640
Madhavi madam.

1808
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:05,170
This is not the proper way.

1809
01:42:05,190 --> 01:42:07,400
-Please sit down. Sit madam.
-Honourable chairperson.

1810
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:09,180
Is this the way you respect the house?

1811
01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:12,600
Right in front of the
Chief Minister of this state.

1812
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:14,480
You say there's no leader in the house.

1813
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:16,430
It's disrespectful to
the entire house, sir.

1814
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:17,820
Honourable chairperson.

1815
01:42:17,870 --> 01:42:19,970
Call for the Motion of confidence.

1816
01:42:20,070 --> 01:42:22,290
And they will get to
know who the Chief Minister is.

1817
01:42:22,990 --> 01:42:24,160
What more should we know?

1818
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:27,150
[Commotion]

1819
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:29,320
-You are ignoring Old City.
-Owaisi sir. Please sit.

1820
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:31,780
-I said sit down. Don't talk.
-This is not correct.

1821
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:34,290
-Reddy sir. Please sit.
-Chairperson, do we need this motion?

1822
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:38,380
-Please sit down.
-They're wasting house's valuable time.

1823
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:41,510
We need Motion of
confidence, Honourable chairperson.

1824
01:42:41,540 --> 01:42:44,550
Your leader should feel shame
to cry for a post that he's not fit for.

1825
01:42:44,570 --> 01:42:46,650
-Sit. Please sit.
-We need Motion of confidence.

1826
01:42:46,970 --> 01:42:48,910
-Please. Sit down.
-We need Motion of confidence.

1827
01:42:49,070 --> 01:42:51,060
-We need it now.
-Jeevan Reddy sir, please sit.

1828
01:42:51,090 --> 01:42:53,820
Did he even know
the meaning of people's love?

1829
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:56,910
This Rama Rao had no self-respect at all.

1830
01:42:56,940 --> 01:42:58,830
He had no shame too.

1831
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:00,650
His entire life is a huge lie.

1832
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:06,890
-What are you saying?
-What?

1833
01:43:06,910 --> 01:43:08,260
-What are you talking?
-Stop it.

1834
01:43:08,290 --> 01:43:10,280
-Stop your nonsense.
-Who are you talking about?

1835
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:12,550
His heart got operated. Not legs right?

1836
01:43:12,590 --> 01:43:16,060
Tell us. He's cheating
the public. He's cheating them.

1837
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:19,640
A nerve from the leg is used in the
surgery. Shame, a MLA don't know that.

1838
01:43:19,670 --> 01:43:20,720
What are you saying?

1839
01:43:20,990 --> 01:43:22,260
Who are you talking about?

1840
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:24,600
[Commotion]

1841
01:43:26,690 --> 01:43:28,960
You sit down first. Shut up and sit.

1842
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:30,410
-Who are you talking about?
-Sir...

1843
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:32,220
You need to think at least a little!

1844
01:43:32,250 --> 01:43:33,930
It's true what we
said. You sit down first.

1845
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:41,110
No one who knew his duties
will ever support this man, sir.

1846
01:43:41,430 --> 01:43:44,130
Whoever stand in
support of him are all fools.

1847
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:46,350
All his people are fraud.

1848
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:49,040
He's not a sage, but a cheat.

1849
01:43:52,570 --> 01:43:54,120
Please. Sit down.

1850
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:57,610
-Please sit down.
-It's N.T.Rama Rao, you are talking about.

1851
01:43:58,100 --> 01:43:59,950
-Have shame.
-We need Motion of confidence.

1852
01:43:59,970 --> 01:44:02,170
Silence. Please. Silence.

1853
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:04,850
See how cheap they are
talking to a lady in this house, sir.

1854
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:09,770
-Sir, you have to stop.
-We need Motion of confidence.

1855
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:13,050
Why are you keeping calm, when
they are talking so shamelessly, sir?

1856
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:17,260
The house is adjourned for three days.

1857
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:22,510
People are protesting
in support of Sir N.T.Rama Rao.

1858
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:24,510
As law and order is unstable right now.

1859
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:27,220
144 section was imposed in major cities.

1860
01:44:27,570 --> 01:44:30,610
4 died in a firing
that occurred in Ananthapuram.

1861
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:34,180
CM Bhaskara Rao's test to
confidence, that should happen today.

1862
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:37,170
Is postponed by Speaker Bhaga Reddy.

1863
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:39,640
The assembly was adjourned for three days.

1864
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:43,340
More than 30 people died for N.T.Rama
Rao. What would you say about that?

1865
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:44,660
They are just natural deaths.

1866
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:46,790
They are taking
political advantage of them.

1867
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:51,180
There are fights and religious
violence in the city. People think that..

1868
01:44:51,210 --> 01:44:54,000
..you are doing all this to
escape the Motion of confidence.

1869
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:55,440
Why should I escape it?

1870
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:59,090
Along with the public, I also
had the support of the opposition.

1871
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:01,400
I will win the Motion of confidence.

1872
01:45:01,650 --> 01:45:03,500
I called all your
families and talked to them.

1873
01:45:04,030 --> 01:45:05,470
The courage of his presence.

1874
01:45:05,790 --> 01:45:07,030
And the hope for his comeback.

1875
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:08,930
Is there in every house.

1876
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,250
Don't worry about your families.

1877
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:13,390
Why worry? We had our
brother with us in the studio.

1878
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:14,720
Hail NTR.

1879
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:17,450
Babu. I know very well about them.

1880
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:19,040
If I can talk to him once.

1881
01:45:19,150 --> 01:45:20,930
I may get a connect. Will try.

1882
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:23,010
Good. Get to him.

1883
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:24,400
And make him talk to me.

1884
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:28,070
Listen, they have asked for 25kgs
chicken and mutton each. I brought it.

1885
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:30,260
Now they are asking for 25 cases of beer.

1886
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:32,250
-Get that too.
-Alcohol?

1887
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:34,010
If NTR comes to know about this!

1888
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:36,150
He will kiss his fist
before punching us in the face.

1889
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:37,660
Look.

1890
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:40,000
We should take care of our MLAs.

1891
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:42,550
No one should enter without my knowledge.

1892
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:44,150
Or should they leave.

1893
01:45:45,010 --> 01:45:46,570
If you feel like anything is wrong.

1894
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,020
Alert me immediately.

1895
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:52,190
Babu, brother-in-law
will be a CM again, right?

1896
01:45:54,860 --> 01:45:56,370
Let's make a huge ruckus.

1897
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:57,890
That old fellow will react to it.

1898
01:45:58,070 --> 01:46:01,020
Then we can get him suspended in the
name of the misbehaviour with ladies.

1899
01:46:01,270 --> 01:46:02,310
I don't know.

1900
01:46:02,410 --> 01:46:05,360
I should call for Motion of
confidence tomorrow, at any cost.

1901
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:07,320
The Governor is forcing me to.

1902
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:09,580
My BP is raising like anything.

1903
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:11,710
It seems like I'll
have a heart attack, sir.

1904
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:13,810
Aren't you feeling well?

1905
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:25,200
-Who's that?
-Ramoji Rao sir.

1906
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:32,630
-Hello?-The Speaker got admitted to the hospital.

1907
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:34,520
Assembly will be
adjourned for few more days.

1908
01:46:34,670 --> 01:46:37,460
They will try to get to
our MLAs in the meantime. Be careful.

1909
01:46:38,030 --> 01:46:39,640
[All shouting]:
Long live NTR.

1910
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:42,690
They cheated our
brother. They cheated him.

1911
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:55,930
As Speaker Bhaga Reddy is unwell, Alauddin
Owaisi took that position temporarily.

1912
01:46:57,180 --> 01:47:01,070
This great human thinks that ruling a
state is as easy as acting in the movies.

1913
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:04,180
He doesn't care about the people
at all. All he wants is the power to rule.

1914
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:06,960
He doesn't want democracy to
live. He only needs his monarchy back.

1915
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:09,900
-How shameless he is. Doesn't even care.
-Madhavi mam. Please.

1916
01:47:09,930 --> 01:47:11,060
Are you trying to provoke?

1917
01:47:11,090 --> 01:47:12,940
-My state is like a young girl.
-Madhavi mam.

1918
01:47:12,970 --> 01:47:15,350
If a shameless old man is
her husband, he shouldn't live.

1919
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:17,650
-You care about women?
-What's she doing? Speaker sir.

1920
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:20,440
I am taking off my bangles
on behalf of them. You just die.

1921
01:47:20,590 --> 01:47:22,540
-You just die.
-Please die.

1922
01:47:22,690 --> 01:47:24,480
What's the use of your life? Please die.

1923
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:26,890
-Die. Die right now.
-Go die.

1924
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:28,320
Why are you looking like that?

1925
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:30,670
-Do you think I fear for that?
-Speaker sir.

1926
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:32,640
They are behaving very disgustingly.

1927
01:47:32,710 --> 01:47:33,780
[spits]

1928
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:34,890
Please go to your places.

1929
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:36,850
You will get cursed
by the women of this state.

1930
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:39,520
You had to die. I
speak on behalf of them all.

1931
01:47:39,550 --> 01:47:41,380
-Go die.
-Please go back. Sit in your places.

01:48:37,540 --> 01:48:39,650
..September 28, 1984.

1949
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:50,860
Ex Chief Minister sir.

1950
01:48:52,990 --> 01:48:55,260
You still look so weak to me.

1951
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:02,810
You look too weak.

1952
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:07,620
If money is my strength,
it will reflect in my arrogance.

1953
01:49:08,230 --> 01:49:10,280
But this is the strength
that my people gave me.

1954
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:12,240
You'll hear it in one single call.

1955
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:16,140
Why did you remain
silent, in the assembly?

1956
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:19,950
Mr. Bhaskara Rao.

1957
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:22,860
Don't mistake my silence as incapability.

1958
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:26,750
Don't forget that
silence is a deadly weapon.

♪ Is back-stabbing the new rule? ♪

1960

Andhra Pradesh turned into a pit of fire.

1961
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:45,160
People are destroying public
assets, in protest against the new CM.

1962
01:49:45,490 --> 01:49:50,700
From villages to the capital, people
are fighting for NTR to be the CM again.

1963
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:53,610
Common men are turning into rebels.

1964
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:56,430
They are fighting,
risking their lives to police fire.

1965
01:49:56,910 --> 01:50:01,300
Along with the state, this situation
had become a challenge to Central too.

1966
01:50:01,740 --> 01:50:06,550
The entire nation is supporting this
volunteer war declared by the public.

1967
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:11,890
Did you meet the President regarding
the situations of the Andhra, madam?

1968
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:13,350
It was a general meeting.

1969
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:16,690
Is your involvement there in
dissolving NTR's government?

1970
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:19,780
That was a decision of Governor sir.

1971
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:24,040
He took this step by
considering the situations over there.

1972
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:26,000
And what is your stand on NTR madam?

1973
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:34,200
-Hello.
-Hello.

1974
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:37,310
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

1975
01:50:39,030 --> 01:50:40,050
Bhaskara Rao sir.

1976
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:43,770
We got orders from
the head office, to be neutral.

1977
01:50:47,310 --> 01:50:49,550
You may not get
anymore help from Congress.

1978
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:53,810
It's you who encouraged us to do
all this. How can you step back now?

1979
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:55,150
In this situation.

1980
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:57,720
Whoever opposes
NTR's party. No matter who it is.

1981
01:50:58,450 --> 01:50:59,830
Their party will have no future.

1982
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:05,380
Sorry, sir.

1983
01:51:16,490 --> 01:51:18,940
The time Ramlal sir gave you...

1984
01:51:18,970 --> 01:51:20,020
It was up.

1985
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:25,000
You should think
about the resignation now.

1986
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:28,950
But Rama Rao haven't proved
his majority in the assembly, right?

1987
01:51:29,370 --> 01:51:30,920
You too haven't proved your majority!

1988
01:51:32,330 --> 01:51:35,060
You are just stopping
the assembly from happening.

1989
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:39,120
Governor sir.

1990
01:51:39,350 --> 01:51:40,820
Please give me some more time.

1991
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,850
Look. Listen to me carefully.

1992
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:46,580
Now you don't have
support from Congress too.

1993
01:51:46,610 --> 01:51:49,520
The public is coming
onto the streets for NTR.

1994
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:52,400
The whole country is
looking at Andhra Pradesh right now.

1995
01:51:52,810 --> 01:51:53,980
I cannot do anything.

1996
01:51:54,870 --> 01:51:55,880
I am helpless.

1997
01:51:56,410 --> 01:51:57,490
Please resign.

1998
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:00,710
Sometime, even losing..

1999
01:52:01,490 --> 01:52:03,070
is also politicking.

2000
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:06,790
I thought he's just a film star.

2001
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:09,340
He would have no idea of politics.

2002
01:52:12,030 --> 01:52:13,880
But I failed to realize...

2003
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:17,260
That he was born out of people's love.

2004
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:25,840
Mom.

2005
01:52:27,510 --> 01:52:28,640
Call from father.

2006
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:30,660
Hello?

2007
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:32,090
How are you Tarakam?

2008
01:52:34,870 --> 01:52:36,010
I am fine.

2009
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:38,580
How are you?

2010
01:52:42,030 --> 01:52:43,630
What's happening there?

2011
01:52:45,450 --> 01:52:48,420
When will be the day...

2012
01:52:49,470 --> 01:52:52,430
You'll take the oath again.

2013
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:54,070
Now!

2014
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:56,330
I got a call from the Governor sir.

2015
01:52:58,530 --> 01:52:59,960
I have to tell this to you first.

2016
01:53:02,450 --> 01:53:04,000
I already knew.

2017
01:53:06,270 --> 01:53:08,250
Now... Come fast...

2018
01:53:09,590 --> 01:53:10,990

-To the hospital.

In this hospital...

2036
01:54:07,690 --> 01:54:10,040
How many people will be there?

2037
01:54:10,970 --> 01:54:12,300
Almost 300 people, sister.

2038
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:17,590
For everyone...

2039
01:54:18,030 --> 01:54:19,300
Let's gift some clothes.

2040
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:22,510
Make the required arrangements.

This...

Only I have to do this.

I swear in the name of god.

2068
01:56:05,780 --> 01:56:08,940
For the first time, Delhi came
to know the power of Telugu man.

2069

For the very first time...

2070
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:15,680
For the very first
time, Indira Gandhi tasted defeat.

2079

2081
01:56:46,650 --> 01:56:48,070
You are the only one.

2082
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:49,960
You are the God of our hopes.

2083
01:56:50,410 --> 01:56:51,860
The lion of Andhra.

2084
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,320
Come brother. Let's go see your wife.

2085
01:57:02,450 --> 01:57:04,210
Don't worry. Come brother. Let's go.

2086
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:28,400
Mom.

2087
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:29,700
Mom?

2088
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:31,980
Mom, dad is here.

2089
01:57:39,410 --> 01:57:40,430
Tarakam.

2090
01:57:42,790 --> 01:57:43,890
I couldn't...

2091
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:45,750
..see you properly.

2092
01:57:47,830 --> 01:57:49,650
Please come little closer.

2093
01:57:57,240 --> 01:57:58,360
Tarakam.

2094
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:09,480
I...

2095
01:58:09,650 --> 01:58:10,820
Became your wife.

2096
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:13,590
For 12...

2097
01:58:14,690 --> 01:58:15,840
Children...

2098
01:58:17,030 --> 01:58:18,140
I became the mother.

2099
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:21,480
Tarakam!

2100
01:58:31,030 --> 01:58:32,620
Even the God...

2101
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:36,060
Looked at me with jealousy.

2102
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:38,830
Tarakam.

2103
01:58:40,490 --> 01:58:44,510
[crying]

2104
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:45,700
Tarakam.

2105
01:58:48,950 --> 01:58:49,970
I Love you.

2106
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:55,110
-Mom.
-Mom?

2107
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:57,550
-Mom.
-Aunty.

2108
01:58:57,580 --> 01:58:58,590
-Mom.
-Sister!

2109
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,500
Aunty.

2110
01:59:05,820 --> 01:59:06,880
Mom

2111
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:10,530
No one should cry...

2112
01:59:15,370 --> 01:59:16,980
My Tarakam didn't go anywhere.

2113
01:59:19,470 --> 01:59:21,020
She's inside me, like me.

2114
01:59:23,250 --> 01:59:24,970
She's with me, reverberating in my name.
