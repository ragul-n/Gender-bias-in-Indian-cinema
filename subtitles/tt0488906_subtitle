1
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:06,168
They say,
Time is the greatest healer

2
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:09,105
As for me,
Time tormented me

3
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:12,108
l don't know
what time has turned me into

4
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:14,773
For, l was human once

5
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:19,118
Bala... Balajit Roy.
A table for three, please

6
00:02:19,786 --> 00:02:22,277
Sorry, sir. You don't have
a reservation

7
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:26,216
Are you married?
- No

8
00:02:26,392 --> 00:02:29,452
You're not married?
But l am married!

9
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:32,893
And this is our first anniversary
How can a guy who has...

10
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:38,470
Such a beautiful wife, not make a
booking on his first anniversary?

11
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:40,133
Correct, correct. He's correct

12
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:43,798
Joy... that's Joy Fernandes.
My best friend

13
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,269
And this is Nisha,
my sister-in-law

14
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:51,273
l tell you, she's made a huge mistake
by marrying my friend

15
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:55,821
lf not marry her, l'm surely
going to have an affair with her

16
00:02:56,255 --> 00:03:00,157
And don't worry; my friend
is absolutely understanding!

17
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:04,495
See... Mr Bala... may l have
have affair with your woman?

18
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:06,092
Yes!

19
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,824
Sorry, sir, l'll have to
ask the manager

20
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:11,434
Manager? Why ask the manager?

21
00:03:12,438 --> 00:03:14,429
When l got married, did l
ask the manager?

22
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:17,173
So why must l ask the manager
before booking a table?

23
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,846
l know my friend made a reservation

24
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:23,512
Did you make it?
- Excuse me.

25
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,845
lt's your wedding anniversary. Correct?
- Correct

26
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,920
She's presently your wife. Correct?
- Correct

27
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:34,020
So why would l make a reservation?
- Enough of all this

28
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:36,058
Let's go to another place,
or l'm leaving

29
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:39,630
Hey, one minute.
- Wait, we'll do something

30
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:41,524
Please call the manager

31
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:43,859
What seems to be the
problem, gentlemen?

32
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:46,202
They don't have a reservation, sir

33
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:49,468
What reservation does one need
to have an affair in Bangkok...?

34
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:54,370
But you need to reserve a table!
- But l want to have an affair and...

35
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:58,373
Let's... let's ask the manager.
Sir...

36
00:03:58,885 --> 00:04:02,150
Please understand! Please understand!
- Please give them the table

37
00:04:02,388 --> 00:04:04,379
Please... follow me.
- Thank you

38
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:08,957
The ass thought we were really drunk!
- You guys were the limit today!

39
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:14,228
Honey, ask him. l used to be
a terrific actor in school

40
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:16,525
Really?
- Yes, he wanted to become an actor...

41
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:19,895
but became a software engineer by sheer
accident. Shah Rukh Khan is lucky

42
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:22,903
lf this guy were in the movies,
Shah Rukh Khan would've been out!

43
00:04:23,242 --> 00:04:26,507
You jerk, l'm here in Bangkok
and you're returning to Mumbai?

44
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:29,211
But my brother's getting married.
- lt's your brother's wedding, not yours

45
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:30,543
But...
- Hear me out

46
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,982
You can't help having the siblings
you have, but you choose your friends

47
00:04:33,252 --> 00:04:35,447
So who's greater? The one you
can't help, or the one you choose?

48
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:39,915
Hear that? He ought to have been a
writer... instead, he's into software!

49
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,092
Javed Akhtar is lucky. Had this guy
been in films, Mr Javed Akhtar...

50
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:46,587
lf you guys are finished with your
flashback, may we order some food?

51
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,161
l'm very hungry.
- Sure, darling

52
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,599
lndeed. He had to become a chef...
- One moment, hang on

53
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,433
Today's my wedding anniversary.
Let me say something romantic to her

54
00:04:54,974 --> 00:04:57,169
You say the romantic things,
l'll settle for romance

55
00:04:57,376 --> 00:04:58,638
Don't you feel ashamed?

56
00:04:58,945 --> 00:05:01,436
l do, but one look at my face,
and she goes running away

57
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:04,343
A sister-in-law is like
a mother, you know?

58
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:08,383
Don't let my father hear that.
lt'll give him strange ideas

59
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:13,119
l've never been able to figure out
the friendship you guys share

60
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:15,623
We haven't figured out either.
- Explain it to her

61
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:18,420
Open that, will you?
- Hey sorry

62
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:29,630
This is not fair, Bala.
You have such a lovely house...

63
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:35,506
an affectionate friend like me
and a beautiful and caring wife...

64
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:38,312
and what do l have?
- Come closer

65
00:05:39,318 --> 00:05:41,309
You got shit luck

66
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:46,513
l wish my company would let me
develop software in lndia itself

67
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:49,655
Tell me something. ls this software
really going to be...

68
00:05:49,996 --> 00:05:51,725
the end of the postal services?

69
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:54,566
Why else are they investing
so much of money in my project?

70
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:58,434
But their condition is that l operate
only from their office in Bangkok

71
00:06:00,406 --> 00:06:04,103
Will you make a lot of money? As much
as the top industrialists?

72
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,503
Much more.
- How come?

73
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,674
Because the industrialists
don't have a friend like you

74
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:17,011
Pull my leg, go ahead! But no matter
how you blackmail me emotionally..

75
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:20,355
l'm going to have an affair
with your wife

76
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:24,526
Remember that girl in school?

77
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:27,031
l was about to hit on her
when you...

78
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:32,603
Hurry up, your cab has arrived.
You'll miss the flight!

79
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,234
One minute

80
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:37,572
Tell me something, Bala

81
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,671
Why are wives so jealous of the
friendship men share?

82
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:44,647
You'll get to know when you marry

83
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:47,645
l was about to...
when you made away with her

84
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:51,379
See? lsn't she beautiful?

85
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:54,492
lt'll take me four hours
on the flight now...

86
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:57,556
l'll see whether l can
find a nice airhostess

87
00:06:58,064 --> 00:07:00,396
And you can have fun here.
- Have fun?

88
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:03,064
We haven't even a bed
and you talk of fun?

89
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:05,260
You have the floor. Granite-top

90
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,066
Don't we need mattresses? And there's
not even a towel here

91
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,242
From a sofa-set to spoons,
we still have to buy everything

92
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:15,503
lt'll take us a week to shop
and do up the house

93
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:17,839
Haven't you done any shopping yet?
- You were supposed do it

94
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:20,516
Me?
- Had you been here, you'd have done it

95
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,248
And l'd have fun with my wife.
- Oh yes

96
00:07:23,422 --> 00:07:26,084
Yes, make me burn in envy.
Go ahead

97
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:30,494
Looks like even the aircraft
will crash at the way l burn

98
00:07:32,131 --> 00:07:35,225
No aircraft is going to crash because
of a small-time sinner like you

99
00:07:36,802 --> 00:07:38,793
Well, l must leave you now

100
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:42,703
You called me for your anniversary.
Also call me when you divorce

101
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:45,100
Sure.
- Shall we...?

102
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:53,580
Not her...?
Okay, maybe later

103
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,611
Go on... l'll fix you later

104
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:10,128
May l speak to Dr Chadha please?
- Speaking

105
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:12,798
Doctor, this is Nisha Roy here

106
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,639
l was calling regarding
my pregnancy test

107
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:18,804
Hi Nisha! You'll be happy to know
that you've tested positive

108
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:21,679
l'm sure your husband is
going to be delighted too

109
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:23,882
Congratulations.
- Of course, doctor

110
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:27,316
l must go and give him the
news now. Thank you, doctor!

111
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,222
Mister... mister... please!

112
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:44,686
For how long are you going to
keep me locked up here?

113
00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:46,891
lt's already 3 months!

114
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:50,794
Please... at least tell me
what wrong l have done!

115
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:53,831
What have l done?
At least tell me what l've done!

116
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,229
Please, mister... please!

117
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:58,232
Damn you, you bloody swines!
Sister-fuckers!

118
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:00,905
lf you have the balls,
come on inside!

119
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:03,577
You want to fight,
come inside and fight!

120
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,847
l'll take you apart!
l'll tear you to shreds!

121
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:09,580
Mister... please

122
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:13,783
Okay, okay... l'm sorry.
Terribly sorry

123
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:20,555
l'm just a software engineer!
Never got into a fight with anyone

124
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:22,924
Please listen to me, mister... please

125
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,261
What do you want?
At least tell me

126
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:29,267
You want my software?
l'll give it to you!

127
00:10:29,608 --> 00:10:32,839
But please don't lock me up here.
Please, mister... please!

128
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,941
Please open the door!
Please, mister...

129
00:10:39,318 --> 00:10:43,277
Open the door!

130
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:47,649
l don't want any food!

131
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,292
Open the door!
Please open the door!

132
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:58,967
Open the door, please

133
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:08,312
Open the door

134
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:12,913
Had l known they'd hold me captive
in this room for 14 years...

135
00:11:14,086 --> 00:11:17,783
would it have lessened my anguish?
Or increased it?

136
00:11:49,588 --> 00:11:50,919
Fried wantons

137
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,860
Morning and evening, every day, every
single day... the same fried wantons

138
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:10,596
Red Circle

139
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,699
lt's believed in Buddhism that when
two people are destined to meet...

140
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,033
the place they meet at
is called the Red Circle

141
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:23,378
ls that what you're
trying to tell me?

142
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,385
l'm waiting

143
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:40,725
Whenever this tune is played, they
release valium gas into the chamber

144
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:47,067
lt's a gas used to control
dangerously violent criminals

145
00:13:54,113 --> 00:13:55,740
When l've passed out...

146
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:59,573
somebody comes and gives me a haircut,
cleans up the cell...

147
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:02,210
changes my clothes

148
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:19,102
Bala...

149
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:24,268
Bala...

150
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,244
Now for the crimebeat

151
00:15:39,585 --> 00:15:45,251
A woman was murdered in a bungalow
at Sandhurst Road last night

152
00:15:45,924 --> 00:15:47,858
She used to live all alone...

153
00:15:48,026 --> 00:15:50,586
ever since her husband, Balajit Roy,
went missing a year ago

154
00:15:51,096 --> 00:15:53,189
He suddenly returned
home last night

155
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,690
There ensued a quarrel
between the couple...

156
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:58,199
following which Balajit Roy murdered
his wife and escaped

157
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:02,604
Police sources say that the blood stains
found on the victim's clothes...

158
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:04,765
matches Balajit Roy's blood-group

159
00:16:05,277 --> 00:16:09,270
Balajit Roy's fingerprints have also
been found on a glass in the bungalow

160
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:13,611
The Bangkok police have launched
a massive manhunt for Balajit

161
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,429
l'm undergoing punishment.
My crime lives on

162
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:11,258
And l'm being kept alive

163
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:15,665
You're keeping me alive only because
you want to meet me, too

164
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:34,824
But you can't control
the way l think

165
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:38,119
You can't control my memories

166
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,730
l'll think of every person
l ever had anything to do with...

167
00:18:46,838 --> 00:18:49,568
every human being
l must have ever harmed

168
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:51,732
Any harm

169
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,145
And my pain.
You can't control that either

170
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:07,251
Every line l carve on myself will
remind me of every moment l spent here

171
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:10,825
One line for each year

172
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:39,246
Who are you?
And when are we meeting?

173
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:43,759
Now, even l'm waiting to meet you
face to face

174
00:19:44,696 --> 00:19:47,221
And this time, l won'tjust wait

175
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:51,964
l'll develop myself. For you.
Only for you

176
00:19:56,475 --> 00:19:59,933
l have survived. l will escape
and destroy you

177
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:18,719
Princess Diana was given a final farewell
at the Westminister Abbey today

178
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:23,156
Hundreds of thousands of people assembled
to take one last look at her remains

179
00:20:56,801 --> 00:21:00,396
The lndian army is doing its best to
throw out Pakistani infiltrators

180
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:04,807
Air strikes continued for
a fourth day today

181
00:21:26,164 --> 00:21:28,155
lt's raining outside

182
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:36,973
Rainwater!

183
00:21:41,012 --> 00:21:43,003
The sound of freedom!

184
00:21:43,882 --> 00:21:45,816
l will get my freedom!

185
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,601
lt was 8:42 a.m. on Tuesday...

186
00:22:13,778 --> 00:22:18,613
when the collision into the World Trade
Center was captured on camera

187
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,078
The second World Trade tower in
New York was also reduced to rubble

188
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:53,007
People fell over each other
in order to break...

189
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,981
every last remnant of Saddam's regime

190
00:22:57,055 --> 00:22:59,956
Australia set a huge target
of 359 runs

191
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:02,516
Those that escaped, were lucky

192
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:06,854
But those that were swept away
by the waves...

193
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:09,023
were separated from their
loved ones forever

194
00:23:24,616 --> 00:23:28,211
Everything has come to a standstill in
the last 3 years. Absolute standstill

195
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:32,916
Neither was there fog, nor gas,
nor was l made to faint

196
00:23:34,225 --> 00:23:38,218
Nobody even gave me a haircut,
nor did anyone clean my room

197
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:41,565
But l'm ready

198
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:45,968
The day l come face to face with you,
l will destroy you

199
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:53,863
lt's getting difficult to recognise
Bangkok after long 14 years

200
00:25:55,366 --> 00:25:58,927
So how will l recognise him?
Where will l look for him?

201
00:26:00,171 --> 00:26:02,799
And what must he look like?
Who is he?

202
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,492
l haven't come here to save the women
of this city from these thugs

203
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:34,394
All l want to see is whether the
training l received from tv...

204
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:36,607
is any good

205
00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:57,084
You liked the clothes?

206
00:27:57,488 --> 00:28:00,013
Who are you? And why did
you do this to me?

207
00:28:00,491 --> 00:28:03,927
Why did you hold me captive for 14
years and set me free like this?

208
00:28:04,495 --> 00:28:07,828
You've been transferred, not set free.
From a small jail to a bigger one

209
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:12,060
This city is a jail for you, Bala.
Where would you go, if you left it?

210
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:17,507
Who are you? And why did you do this?
Fourteen years...?

211
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:22,169
lt either takes a madman to do
what l did to you...

212
00:28:22,513 --> 00:28:24,242
or a lot of hatred

213
00:28:24,749 --> 00:28:29,516
lf this is how much you hate me,
why did you keep me alive?

214
00:28:30,622 --> 00:28:32,522
Why didn't you kill me?

215
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:35,520
Who are you?

216
00:28:35,693 --> 00:28:38,184
Matt? Paresh Gilani?

217
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:43,191
lmran Hafiz? Sameer Hafiz?
Who are you?

218
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:48,129
l'm doing a research on you. Who l am
should not be as important to you...

219
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:51,531
as much as WHY? Not who, but why

220
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,135
Think, Bala. And think hard

221
00:28:56,981 --> 00:28:58,972
Carefully read the
book of your life

222
00:29:00,351 --> 00:29:03,548
The period at school is over.
And it's time for homework

223
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:06,980
By the way, your steak
is getting cold

224
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,334
486. Sandhurst Road.
- No English

225
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:54,838
Sandhurst Road.
Near the jetty... jetty?

226
00:30:01,979 --> 00:30:04,504
Mister, you're an lndian.
So sit in an lndian's car

227
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:09,580
Don't get into that guy's trap.
He'll take you on a jolly ride...

228
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:11,912
and not even take you
to your destination

229
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:15,582
He'll burn a hole in your pocket too.
So c'mon, l'll take you there

230
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:20,856
Where do you want to go?
- 486, Sandhurst Road

231
00:30:21,032 --> 00:30:23,023
By the jetty

232
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:01,060
By the way, you didn't ask the question
every passenger asks Jenny Singh

233
00:31:02,573 --> 00:31:05,440
''How can a woman drive a cab?
That too, in Bangkok?''

234
00:31:06,277 --> 00:31:09,269
l know Bangkok
like the back of my hand

235
00:31:10,915 --> 00:31:13,179
That's because my father used to be
the driver of tourist buses

236
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:17,221
And l spent more time in the buses
than l spent at home

237
00:31:17,822 --> 00:31:21,280
That's because my Mom died even
before l could say ''Mummy''

238
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,722
My Papa and l were the only ones

239
00:31:27,064 --> 00:31:29,965
Papa resigned from his post at the
bus-service and bought this cab

240
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:34,228
But you know, tragedies and bananas
never come in singles

241
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:37,832
Dad died too.
Maybe to drive God's car

242
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,074
All that is left now is this taxi
and my antique house

243
00:31:43,714 --> 00:31:46,410
Plot number 62.
Belonging to Jenny Singh, sir

244
00:31:47,018 --> 00:31:48,815
The most beautiful one in Chao Thep

245
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:52,651
You appear to be silent types

246
00:33:30,488 --> 00:33:33,685
Where do you want to go now, sir?
- How much do you earn in a day?

247
00:33:35,626 --> 00:33:37,617
You're not a taxman, are you?

248
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:42,096
Without tips, 3000.
On good days, l make 5000

249
00:33:46,203 --> 00:33:49,434
Here's 10,000. l want to go around
the whole of Bangkok today

250
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,678
For so much, l'd take you around
the whole of Thailand

251
00:33:56,113 --> 00:33:59,605
Where'll l get fried wantons?
- China Town. Let's go

252
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,604
''This then, is my story...''

253
00:34:25,142 --> 00:34:28,134
''about a quiet life''

254
00:34:30,581 --> 00:34:34,142
''The silence asks me...''

255
00:34:36,587 --> 00:34:39,488
''why l'm tolerating
the indignities'

256
00:34:42,526 --> 00:34:45,518
''A legend, of days gone by...''

257
00:34:48,299 --> 00:34:51,598
''from the lips of loneliness''

258
00:34:54,271 --> 00:34:58,173
''Every wound seems to speak...''

259
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:02,779
''it seems to say something
to me''

260
00:35:05,516 --> 00:35:08,508
''Agonising thorns of memories...''

261
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:15,690
''l pick from my past''

262
00:35:17,628 --> 00:35:19,926
''ln the refuge of crumbling walls...''

263
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:26,526
''l'm still alive''

264
00:35:29,306 --> 00:35:31,866
''lt's certainly not love,
my rosegarden sees...''

265
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:35,608
''lurking shadows of death''

266
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,208
''My eyes are excited with
everything that is familiar''

267
00:35:39,884 --> 00:35:45,220
''There is no one who can tell me
how much l will have to wait for light''

268
00:35:46,223 --> 00:35:49,681
''There is no one...
neither with me, nor at a distance''

269
00:35:50,227 --> 00:35:52,627
''There is a friend,
my heartbeat...''

270
00:35:52,963 --> 00:35:55,727
''which keeps telling me
what l seek''

271
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,700
''Life, l live...''

272
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,800
''swallowing on my own blood...''

273
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:04,730
''trying to sew life together
with thorns''

274
00:36:20,257 --> 00:36:24,250
''There is no one with me anymore...''

275
00:36:25,763 --> 00:36:30,427
''and yet, there is
the realisation...''

276
00:36:33,671 --> 00:36:36,799
Stop, stop! How many restaurants
are you going to visit?

277
00:36:37,274 --> 00:36:42,610
What on earth are you looking for?
- ''My desire to live''

278
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,649
''My heart, like a jungle
of memories''

279
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:53,615
''My heart, scarred by thorns''

280
00:36:54,058 --> 00:36:56,049
C'mon. Let's go to another restaurant

281
00:36:56,427 --> 00:36:59,828
''Piercing thorns of memories...''

282
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:06,295
''l pick from my past''

283
00:37:38,736 --> 00:37:40,931
l'll wait for you in your cab

284
12:52:27,000 --> 12:52:29,000
Hello, sir! Out! Out!

285
12:52:30,000 --> 12:52:32,000
l don't want to get into problems.
Nor do l want your money!

286
12:52:33,000 --> 12:52:34,000
Find another taxi

287
12:52:35,000 --> 12:52:37,000
Else, Jenny will land in jail
and God will own the cab!

288
12:52:38,000 --> 12:52:39,000
Shut up and drive

289
12:52:42,000 --> 12:52:45,000
Where to?
- Some deserted place

290
12:53:31,000 --> 12:53:33,000
Ask him who he works for and where

291
12:53:50,000 --> 12:53:51,000
Ask him again

292
12:54:21,000 --> 12:54:22,000
Hold it! He's willing to talk

293
12:54:35,000 --> 12:54:36,000
Sit in the car

294
12:54:56,000 --> 12:54:57,000
Cathay View

295
12:55:00,000 --> 12:55:01,000
After that, you may leave

296
12:55:50,000 --> 12:55:51,000
Open.
- Go away

297
12:56:34,000 --> 12:56:38,000
There's always room in my hotel.
No, not the bodyguards

298
12:56:39,000 --> 12:56:41,000
We'll have your guest picked up
from wherever you say...

299
12:56:41,000 --> 12:56:42,000
and keep him here for as long
as you wish

300
12:56:43,000 --> 12:56:46,000
No, no restrictions on the period sir.
We held a man here for 14 years

301
12:56:47,000 --> 12:56:48,000
Additional services will
cost you extra

302
12:56:49,000 --> 12:56:52,000
lf you want us to torture your guest
every day, it'll cost you extra

303
12:56:54,000 --> 12:56:56,000
l'll let you know the dates.
They should be available

304
12:56:57,000 --> 12:57:01,000
As you wish. Pay in installments
or a lump sum... it's okay

305
12:57:08,000 --> 12:57:12,000
Why did you do it?
- Business. Nothing personal

306
12:57:13,000 --> 12:57:14,000
Who asked you to do it?

307
12:57:18,000 --> 12:57:19,000
Confidential

308
12:57:21,000 --> 12:57:24,000
Who makes us do it and why...
we never know anything

309
12:57:26,000 --> 12:57:27,000
We only do ourjob

310
12:58:01,000 --> 12:58:02,000
Will you now squeal?

311
12:58:06,000 --> 12:58:07,000
l don't know him

312
12:58:09,000 --> 12:58:11,000
l've only spoken to him
over the phone

313
12:58:12,000 --> 12:58:14,000
l never could meet him

314
13:02:00,000 --> 13:02:02,000
''Death has been shamed...''

315
13:02:05,000 --> 13:02:08,000
''for, in body...''

316
13:02:10,000 --> 13:02:12,000
''there is still life''

317
13:02:19,000 --> 13:02:22,000
''So much of wind, after all,
my breathing...''

318
13:02:24,000 --> 13:02:26,000
''everything else has been
reduced to dust''

319
13:02:27,000 --> 13:02:30,000
''l live...''

320
13:02:32,000 --> 13:02:34,000
''but whatever for?''

321
13:02:37,000 --> 13:02:40,000
''l'm alive...''

322
13:02:41,000 --> 13:02:42,000
''but what for?''

323
13:02:55,000 --> 13:02:58,000
''The assault was murderous...''

324
13:03:00,000 --> 13:03:02,000
''and yet my fondness for wounds...''

325
13:03:05,000 --> 13:03:07,000
''is still alive''

326
13:03:10,000 --> 13:03:13,000
''My pulse is dipping,
the pain agonises me...''

327
13:03:15,000 --> 13:03:17,000
''everything else is dust''

328
13:03:18,000 --> 13:03:21,000
''l am alive...''

329
13:03:22,000 --> 13:03:23,000
''but whatever for?''

330
13:03:32,000 --> 13:03:33,000
Taxi! Taxi!

331
13:03:48,000 --> 13:03:49,000
Chao Thep. Club no 62

332
13:03:53,000 --> 13:03:54,000
Look after yourself, Bala

333
13:04:42,000 --> 13:04:43,000
You...? You've come back?

334
13:04:44,000 --> 13:04:45,000
Spare me, please!

335
13:04:46,000 --> 13:04:48,000
l don't want your money, okay?
Find yourself another taxi!

336
13:04:49,000 --> 13:04:50,000
Hey ass... you brought him here?

337
13:04:55,000 --> 13:04:56,000
Look, mister... you're trouble, okay?

338
13:04:58,000 --> 13:05:00,000
Trouble in my cab, trouble at China
Town and now trouble in my house!

339
13:05:01,000 --> 13:05:02,000
Go away!

340
13:05:06,000 --> 13:05:09,000
Look, l don't want to die so soon

341
13:05:11,000 --> 13:05:12,000
l want to live

342
13:05:41,000 --> 13:05:43,000
Have you really been
through all this?

343
13:05:47,000 --> 13:05:50,000
You were quite ill last night.
You fainted... and l got worried

344
13:05:51,000 --> 13:05:52,000
l called a doctor...

345
13:05:53,000 --> 13:05:55,000
he put stitches on your back
and gave some medicines for you

346
13:05:57,000 --> 13:05:58,000
Do you have a tape-recorder?

347
13:06:05,000 --> 13:06:08,000
Why don't you have him killed?
- lt's necessary for me that he lives

348
13:06:09,000 --> 13:06:12,000
As you wish, sir. A client's wish
is our command. So we'll keep him alive

349
13:06:13,000 --> 13:06:15,000
But keeping him alive for so long
can even drive him insane

350
13:06:16,000 --> 13:06:18,000
No. He mustn't go insane

351
13:06:19,000 --> 13:06:21,000
Keep giving him medicines and see
that he remains in his senses

352
13:06:21,000 --> 13:06:22,000
How long do we hold him here?

353
13:06:24,000 --> 13:06:26,000
We hold him for 14 years.
- 14 years?

354
13:06:27,000 --> 13:06:29,000
We haven't held anyone captive
for so long

355
13:06:30,000 --> 13:06:32,000
May l ask you a question, if it
does not offend you sir?

356
13:06:33,000 --> 13:06:34,000
What's his fault?

357
13:06:34,000 --> 13:06:36,000
Balajit's fault is that he has
no control over his tongue

358
13:06:38,000 --> 13:06:40,000
Neither will he live, nor die

359
13:06:42,000 --> 13:06:44,000
He'll be fed twice a day.
ln a fully monitored room

360
13:06:45,000 --> 13:06:47,000
l want him alive

361
13:06:48,000 --> 13:06:49,000
Okay, sir

362
13:06:57,000 --> 13:06:58,000
We share very old relations, Bala

363
13:07:00,000 --> 13:07:02,000
The moment you and l have spent
14 years waiting for...

364
13:07:04,000 --> 13:07:06,000
is now very close.
But it hasn't yet arrived

365
13:07:08,000 --> 13:07:10,000
Anyway, let me give you another clue
to get closer to me

366
13:07:12,000 --> 13:07:13,000
To Sea Runset

367
13:07:20,000 --> 13:07:21,000
Where is To Sea Runset?

368
13:07:22,000 --> 13:07:24,000
That's the old name of a club

369
13:07:25,000 --> 13:07:26,000
But you can get there
only by boat

370
13:09:47,000 --> 13:09:48,000
Bala...?

371
13:10:03,000 --> 13:10:06,000
Balajit is a special guest of mine.
Do not bother about money

372
13:10:09,000 --> 13:10:11,000
Such guests do not come calling
on me every other day

373
13:10:11,000 --> 13:10:14,000
He must get VlP treatment.
Lace his drink...

374
13:10:16,000 --> 13:10:18,000
so that he neither dies,
nor goes mad

375
13:10:20,000 --> 13:10:23,000
l want Balajit Roy alive

376
13:10:25,000 --> 13:10:28,000
Neither do l have the time to tell you
my story, nor even time to shed tears

377
13:10:29,000 --> 13:10:32,000
l want this man.
You recognise this voice?

378
13:10:37,000 --> 13:10:37,000
No

379
13:10:40,000 --> 13:10:41,000
But who could hate you so much?

380
13:10:43,000 --> 13:10:46,000
The question is how did he
get to know where you live?

381
13:10:49,000 --> 13:10:50,000
Only he can tell

382
13:10:59,000 --> 13:11:01,000
How's the reunion of friends
after 14 years, Joy Fernandes?

383
13:11:05,000 --> 13:11:07,000
How did you get to know my whereabouts?

384
13:11:09,000 --> 13:11:13,000
Whereabouts is no big thing, Joy.
Your blood group, your DNA...

385
13:11:13,000 --> 13:11:15,000
and the number of snooker games
you've won in the last 14 years...

386
13:11:17,000 --> 13:11:18,000
l know everything
- Listen, you...

387
13:11:24,000 --> 13:11:27,000
l can trace this number.
- How? lt's a private number

388
13:11:28,000 --> 13:11:29,000
l have my contacts

389
13:11:32,000 --> 13:11:34,000
Before that, l need to
talk to the cabbie

390
13:11:40,000 --> 13:11:42,000
Don't except mercy
because you're a woman

391
13:11:43,000 --> 13:11:45,000
Tell me... who is he?
- l don't know anything

392
13:11:46,000 --> 13:11:48,000
His name. Where does he live?

393
13:11:49,000 --> 13:11:51,000
l don't know anyone!
- lf you don't...

394
13:11:51,000 --> 13:11:55,000
how did he get to know where you live?
How could he send the cabbie here?

395
13:11:56,000 --> 13:11:58,000
Why don't you ask him?
You have his number!

396
13:12:04,000 --> 13:12:07,000
Bala, l've traced him. He lives
in the house opposite Jenny's

397
13:12:42,000 --> 13:12:43,000
So here we are

398
13:12:49,000 --> 13:12:51,000
Face to face

399
13:12:53,000 --> 13:12:55,000
You and l have waited 14 years
for this moment

400
13:12:58,000 --> 13:13:00,000
That's because before l kill you...

401
13:13:03,000 --> 13:13:04,000
or perhaps before you kill me...

402
13:13:05,000 --> 13:13:08,000
we must enjoy this moment to
the fullest. Am l right?

403
13:13:11,000 --> 13:13:12,000
Who the hell are you?

404
13:13:13,000 --> 13:13:16,000
What is know is that
you made me, Bala

405
13:13:17,000 --> 13:13:18,000
And l made you

406
13:13:20,000 --> 13:13:22,000
By the way, l also created a huge
business empire in these 14 years

407
13:13:24,000 --> 13:13:27,000
But more than that, l'm proud
of the monster l have created. You

408
13:13:30,000 --> 13:13:33,000
You make me proud, Bala.
To make money is easy

409
13:13:34,000 --> 13:13:37,000
But to make a monster
is the work of a genius

410
13:13:38,000 --> 13:13:39,000
Damn you...

411
13:13:40,000 --> 13:13:44,000
Manners, boys. That's not
the way to treat guests

412
13:13:48,000 --> 13:13:50,000
Especially when a guest has
just a short time to live

413
13:13:52,000 --> 13:13:53,000
And you have no time at all

414
13:13:54,000 --> 13:13:56,000
C'mon, Bala.
Can you really kill me?

415
13:14:00,000 --> 13:14:04,000
Until you get to know why l held you
captive for 14 years?

416
13:14:05,000 --> 13:14:07,000
Until you get to know why
l released you after that?

417
13:14:12,000 --> 13:14:14,000
You have time till July 5th
to find the answers

418
13:14:15,000 --> 13:14:18,000
Which means... only 4 days

419
13:14:22,000 --> 13:14:23,000
Give me a chair

420
13:14:30,000 --> 13:14:33,000
l'll first destroy every lovely thing
you like... and finally, you

421
13:14:36,000 --> 13:14:38,000
When revenge is the meaning
of one's existence...

422
13:14:38,000 --> 13:14:40,000
the meaning is lost,
when one has had his revenge

423
13:14:42,000 --> 13:14:46,000
Man finds himself lonely.
That is why l kept you alive

424
13:14:49,000 --> 13:14:52,000
And revenge for what?
What did l do to you?

425
13:14:55,000 --> 13:14:57,000
You want to get to know everything
in the very first meeting?

426
13:14:58,000 --> 13:15:00,000
Patience. All in good time

427
13:15:02,000 --> 13:15:04,000
You'll get to hear the story
as well as its climax

428
13:15:05,000 --> 13:15:09,000
l don't know how and why you and l
came into each other's life story

429
13:15:10,000 --> 13:15:14,000
What l do know is that l will script
the ending of your story

430
13:15:16,000 --> 13:15:18,000
And l have scripted
every thing in your life

431
13:15:20,000 --> 13:15:26,000
You meet your friend and your
friend brings you here...

432
13:15:27,000 --> 13:15:30,000
every little thing in your life
has been scripted by me

433
13:15:33,000 --> 13:15:35,000
l'm the one who brought you
to Bangkok

434
13:15:36,000 --> 13:15:37,000
The software company
you worked for...

435
13:15:40,000 --> 13:15:42,000
happened to be one of
the many companies l owned

436
13:15:43,000 --> 13:15:45,000
l have so much of money,
such a huge business...

437
13:15:47,000 --> 13:15:49,000
and yet, l'm just like you.
Lonely

438
13:15:53,000 --> 13:15:57,000
But l never felt the loneliness.
Because you were with me

439
13:15:59,000 --> 13:16:02,000
All 24 hours of the day,
writhing in agony

440
13:16:05,000 --> 13:16:09,000
lt's your pain that kept me alive.
Your pain was my cure

441
13:16:12,000 --> 13:16:13,000
And now, your pain will be my cure

442
13:16:16,000 --> 13:16:20,000
That's the spirit!
You are my pain and l am your pain

443
13:16:21,000 --> 13:16:24,000
Let the worse pain win!
Pain it is that erases pain

444
13:16:25,000 --> 13:16:27,000
He who suffers the worse pain
will win

445
13:16:35,000 --> 13:16:38,000
By the way, you're quite careless
when it comes to women

446
13:16:40,000 --> 13:16:44,000
You couldn't save your wife. And you've
even left Jenny all alone at home

447
13:16:50,000 --> 13:16:55,000
You forgot to even shut the door.
Go and see if she's okay

448
13:17:15,000 --> 13:17:16,000
Bad manners!

449
13:17:16,000 --> 13:17:19,000
Haven't you been taught to knock
before you enter somebody's home?

450
13:17:21,000 --> 13:17:23,000
Go down on your knees and
ask for forgiveness

451
13:17:27,000 --> 13:17:31,000
Apologise!
Or the girl's going to die

452
13:17:32,000 --> 13:17:34,000
Makes no difference to me.
- Really...?

453
13:17:36,000 --> 13:17:39,000
Then why did you rush here
like a regular Romeo?

454
13:17:47,000 --> 13:17:48,000
Good boy

455
13:17:49,000 --> 13:17:52,000
You had my business closed down.
Now watch the fun

456
13:17:54,000 --> 13:17:58,000
Keep these dentures.
You're going to need them

457
13:18:03,000 --> 13:18:06,000
Good job. lt's going to be fun

458
13:18:07,000 --> 13:18:08,000
Because it's my turn to
yank out your teeth

459
13:18:10,000 --> 13:18:11,000
But l won't do it

460
13:18:15,000 --> 13:18:17,000
You will yourself pluck out
your own teeth

461
13:18:18,000 --> 13:18:19,000
Love it? Take it!

462
13:18:48,000 --> 13:18:49,000
Stop

463
13:18:57,000 --> 13:19:01,000
You're knocking out his teeth?
- Of course, sir. With pleasure!

464
13:19:03,000 --> 13:19:06,000
You'll do nothing of the sort.
- Are you kidding, sir?

465
13:19:08,000 --> 13:19:10,000
He'll have to pay a price
for my teeth

466
13:19:10,000 --> 13:19:12,000
The price for your teeth
is lying in that bag

467
13:19:19,000 --> 13:19:22,000
You know my weakness, sir.
Thank you

468
13:19:31,000 --> 13:19:32,000
You're a fortunate man

469
13:19:35,000 --> 13:19:36,000
He loves you so much

470
13:19:38,000 --> 13:19:39,000
Let's end this episode right here

471
13:19:40,000 --> 13:19:44,000
Else, l'm going to hack the hand
you touch the girl with

472
13:19:46,000 --> 13:19:48,000
ln that case, you'll have to
cut off my tongue too

473
13:20:23,000 --> 13:20:26,000
Do you believe me now?
Or do you still need proof?

474
13:20:46,000 --> 13:20:49,000
Steel is up 14 points, pharma is up
23 points. What else is happening?

475
13:20:51,000 --> 13:20:52,000
l need 2 million pharma

476
13:20:54,000 --> 13:20:55,000
With competition, prices will fall

477
13:20:57,000 --> 13:21:03,000
Get me lT, infocomm, airlines,
life insurance, hotels...

478
13:21:05,000 --> 13:21:08,000
No, l'm not available for any
meeting. l'm busy with a guest

479
13:21:11,000 --> 13:21:13,000
There are things in life
that mean more than profits

480
13:21:14,000 --> 13:21:15,000
l'm neither greedy for money,
nor afraid of losses

481
13:21:17,000 --> 13:21:18,000
Even if l lose a million
every day...

482
13:21:19,000 --> 13:21:22,000
it'll take no less than 60 years
for me to go bankrupt

483
13:21:24,000 --> 13:21:29,000
Sixty years. That means, l'll be
ninety-five. And broke

484
13:21:33,000 --> 13:21:33,000
See you

485
13:21:42,000 --> 13:21:43,000
Why outside the city?

486
13:21:45,000 --> 13:21:47,000
Because you've been
sucked into this mess

487
13:21:48,000 --> 13:21:52,000
He escaped because of you today
and l had to go down on my knees

488
13:21:54,000 --> 13:21:56,000
You're making me a weak man

489
13:21:57,000 --> 13:21:58,000
So l must keep you away from this

490
13:22:19,000 --> 13:22:20,000
Sir, the two of them have left

491
13:22:21,000 --> 13:22:23,000
They packed their bags
and left in a car

492
13:22:24,000 --> 13:22:27,000
Keep an eye on them and
keep me informed

493
13:23:16,000 --> 13:23:18,000
l hope you are not uncomfortable?

494
13:23:20,000 --> 13:23:24,000
lf l'm causing you inconvenience,
l can take another room

495
13:23:25,000 --> 13:23:29,000
l have no problems. You are the one
who looks hassled

496
13:23:31,000 --> 13:23:34,000
For fourteen years you haven't been
with a woman

497
13:23:36,000 --> 13:23:40,000
lf you find Gulfam, will you
really cut his hands off?

498
13:23:42,000 --> 13:23:42,000
Yes

499
13:23:43,000 --> 13:23:44,000
Because he hit me?

500
13:23:47,000 --> 13:23:52,000
Scholar said he'd kill me too...
will he really?

501
13:23:56,000 --> 13:23:57,000
Because you like me?

502
13:23:58,000 --> 13:23:59,000
That's what he thinks

503
13:24:02,000 --> 13:24:03,000
And you?

504
13:24:26,000 --> 13:24:29,000
l have always lost the things
that l loved

505
13:24:32,000 --> 13:24:34,000
l don't want to lose more

506
13:25:02,000 --> 13:25:05,000
''l'm breathing...''

507
13:25:06,000 --> 13:25:08,000
''blood still flows...''

508
13:25:09,000 --> 13:25:11,000
''yet why don't l feel...''

509
13:25:12,000 --> 13:25:15,000
''that l'm alive?''

510
13:25:16,000 --> 13:25:18,000
''Am l alive?''

511
13:25:35,000 --> 13:25:37,000
''Why is my heart on fire?''

512
13:25:39,000 --> 13:25:41,000
''Why is my soul restless?''

513
13:25:42,000 --> 13:25:45,000
''My heart beats to question...''

514
13:25:46,000 --> 13:25:49,000
''if l am alive''

515
13:25:50,000 --> 13:25:52,000
''Am l alive?''

516
13:26:09,000 --> 13:26:12,000
''ln unspoken words,
in friendly loneliness...''

517
13:26:13,000 --> 13:26:15,000
''l feel lonely in a crowd''

518
13:26:16,000 --> 13:26:18,000
''Am l alive?''

519
13:26:23,000 --> 13:26:26,000
''This desolate and dark...''

520
13:26:27,000 --> 13:26:29,000
''restlessness...''

521
13:26:31,000 --> 13:26:34,000
''looks for a familiar face... why?''

522
13:26:37,000 --> 13:26:42,000
''My own lost existence questions...''

523
13:26:44,000 --> 13:26:45,000
''am l alive?''

524
13:26:47,000 --> 13:26:49,000
''Am l alive?''

525
13:29:05,000 --> 13:29:08,000
You must use all your time
and energy to reach me

526
13:29:10,000 --> 13:29:11,000
Because l'm your destination, Bala

527
13:29:14,000 --> 13:29:15,000
l've got a present for you

528
13:29:17,000 --> 13:29:19,000
l have done what you wanted to do

529
13:29:21,000 --> 13:29:24,000
Just because l don't want you to
waste your time on such minor tasks

530
13:29:26,000 --> 13:29:29,000
Every step you take must be
towards me, you don't have much time

531
13:29:34,000 --> 13:29:37,000
Just four days.
Every moment is precious, Bala

532
13:29:39,000 --> 13:29:40,000
The task isn't easier either

533
13:29:41,000 --> 13:29:44,000
But ''labor omnia vincit''
Labour conquers all

534
13:29:45,000 --> 13:29:47,000
Labour conquers all problems, Bala

535
13:29:55,000 --> 13:29:56,000
God! My head is splitting

536
13:29:58,000 --> 13:29:59,000
Feels like a bad hangover

537
13:30:01,000 --> 13:30:03,000
Valium.
- What?

538
13:30:05,000 --> 13:30:06,000
Effects of Valium gas

539
13:30:09,000 --> 13:30:11,000
Which means...?
- He was here

540
13:30:12,000 --> 13:30:13,000
Last night

541
13:30:16,000 --> 13:30:18,000
He has also left something

542
13:30:38,000 --> 13:30:40,000
l have done what you wanted to do

543
13:30:41,000 --> 13:30:43,000
Just because l don't want you to
waste your time on such minor tasks

544
13:30:45,000 --> 13:30:49,000
Every step you take must be
towards me, you don't have much time

545
13:30:49,000 --> 13:30:51,000
Just four days.
Labor omnia vincit

546
13:30:52,000 --> 13:30:55,000
Bala, this man is sick.
He's psychotic

547
13:30:58,000 --> 13:31:00,000
We must get out of here

548
13:31:00,000 --> 13:31:02,000
What about my fourteen years?
- And after you've taken your revenge?

549
13:31:05,000 --> 13:31:06,000
l might become a human being again

550
13:31:07,000 --> 13:31:11,000
But how does he know about all this?
My house, this hotel...

551
13:31:12,000 --> 13:31:15,000
how does he know?
- l know. C'mon

552
13:31:43,000 --> 13:31:44,000
What can l do for you?

553
13:31:53,000 --> 13:31:54,000
''l have been bugged.
Find it''

554
13:32:46,000 --> 13:32:48,000
lt was written ''Labor omnia vincit''
What does that mean?

555
13:32:49,000 --> 13:32:51,000
Labour conquers all.
- What language is that?

556
13:32:52,000 --> 13:32:53,000
Latin. And that's my school's motto

557
13:32:55,000 --> 13:32:56,000
School!

558
13:32:58,000 --> 13:32:59,000
l need a cyber cafe

559
13:33:18,000 --> 13:33:21,000
To reach one's destination,
to achieve one's aim...

560
13:33:22,000 --> 13:33:24,000
one has to sometimes wait for years...

561
13:33:24,000 --> 13:33:26,000
track the rise and fall
of the bourses...

562
13:33:27,000 --> 13:33:29,000
must be careful with stocks
you trade in...

563
13:33:30,000 --> 13:33:31,000
who is collaborating with whom...

564
13:33:32,000 --> 13:33:34,000
and who is faking collaboration
to raise his market value...

565
13:33:36,000 --> 13:33:37,000
must watch everything

566
13:33:38,000 --> 13:33:41,000
Unguarded territories
and competitive fronts...

567
13:33:44,000 --> 13:33:46,000
must consider all that before
you attack

568
13:33:48,000 --> 13:33:52,000
When you set a trap for the prey,
he mustn't get a hint

569
13:33:54,000 --> 13:33:58,000
And when the prey is at your mercy,
attack

570
13:34:01,000 --> 13:34:02,000
Kill

571
13:34:04,000 --> 13:34:07,000
Labor omnia vincit

572
13:34:09,000 --> 13:34:10,000
Labour conquers all

573
13:34:12,000 --> 13:34:13,000
Labour conquers all problems

574
13:34:26,000 --> 13:34:27,000
Yes, Bala?

575
13:34:27,000 --> 13:34:29,000
Joy, did we have one Rohit Chopra
in school?

576
13:34:30,000 --> 13:34:34,000
Yes, he was in our school.
Eight years junior

577
13:34:37,000 --> 13:34:40,000
His sister was in our class.
Reema Chopra

578
13:34:41,000 --> 13:34:43,000
Reema?
- Swine, you forgot Reema?

579
13:34:45,000 --> 13:34:46,000
You ought to know Reema better

580
13:34:48,000 --> 13:34:49,000
Remember your last day in school?

581
13:34:59,000 --> 13:35:02,000
Guys, look! Reema Chopra!
The one in the centre

582
13:35:05,000 --> 13:35:08,000
Take a good look at her, Bala.
lt's your last day in school

583
13:35:09,000 --> 13:35:10,000
You are leaving tomorrow

584
13:35:13,000 --> 13:35:13,000
Look

585
13:35:17,000 --> 13:35:20,000
l'll miss her the most, really

586
13:35:21,000 --> 13:35:23,000
You will miss her,
not us, eh?

587
13:35:27,000 --> 13:35:31,000
Bala l tell you, he'll be the luckiest
who lays Reema first

588
13:35:32,000 --> 13:35:33,000
You guys will just keep dreaming

589
13:35:35,000 --> 13:35:38,000
And l will lay her, Joy

590
13:35:39,000 --> 13:35:41,000
You will do it to her?
- l will

591
13:35:42,000 --> 13:35:47,000
Bala, l'm the scoundrel,
the most shameless lad in school

592
13:35:48,000 --> 13:35:50,000
l couldn't lay her,
you think you will do it?

593
13:35:51,000 --> 13:35:53,000
Joy, what if l do it?
- Point

594
13:35:54,000 --> 13:35:56,000
lf you lay her, Bala,
l'll lose 15 bucks

595
13:35:57,000 --> 13:35:58,000
Bet?
- Done

596
13:36:00,000 --> 13:36:02,000
Hurry up, no time

597
13:36:14,000 --> 13:36:16,000
You...? Who are you?
- Hi. Reema Chopra?

598
13:36:17,000 --> 13:36:19,000
Yeah.
- Hi. Bala

599
13:36:21,000 --> 13:36:24,000
Balajeet Roy.
- Hi. What are you doing here?

600
13:36:24,000 --> 13:36:26,000
Boys aren't allowed here!
- l know, but...

601
13:36:26,000 --> 13:36:29,000
l wanted to meet you in private.
- Me? Why in private?

602
13:36:31,000 --> 13:36:34,000
l wanted to give you a gift.
- Gift? Listen...

603
13:36:34,000 --> 13:36:38,000
we have never met before, l didn't
even know your name. So why this gift?

604
13:36:39,000 --> 13:36:41,000
Reema, accept this as a token
of our friendship

605
13:36:42,000 --> 13:36:45,000
Friendship? l'm not so sure.
- C'mon Reema, it's just a simple gift

606
13:36:46,000 --> 13:36:48,000
Take it.
- l'm getting late, l've got to go

607
13:36:49,000 --> 13:36:52,000
Reema please... this is for you
with love, please take it

608
13:36:53,000 --> 13:36:55,000
l don't need it.
- Please Reema. Please

609
13:36:57,000 --> 13:36:59,000
Okay.
- Thanks. Won't you open it?

610
13:37:01,000 --> 13:37:04,000
What? Aren't you acting strange?
- You won't imagine how happy l will be

611
13:37:05,000 --> 13:37:06,000
Open it.
- l told you, l've got to go

612
13:37:07,000 --> 13:37:09,000
Please open it, Reema. Please.
- God!

613
13:37:19,000 --> 13:37:20,000
Damn the wrappings

614
13:37:25,000 --> 13:37:27,000
What the hell is this?
- You like it? lt's for you

615
13:37:28,000 --> 13:37:31,000
And now, wear that for me.
- How dare you?

616
13:37:33,000 --> 13:37:34,000
Now just go from here!
- Fine, l'm going

617
13:37:35,000 --> 13:37:37,000
l'll start shouting. Go!
- Going... relax. Going

618
13:37:39,000 --> 13:37:41,000
And listen! Take this shit with you

619
13:37:43,000 --> 13:37:44,000
Fine, l'm going.
- Go!

620
13:37:51,000 --> 13:37:52,000
What happened?
- Wait

621
13:37:57,000 --> 13:37:57,000
Done

622
13:38:01,000 --> 13:38:02,000
Done, done!

623
13:38:07,000 --> 13:38:08,000
l'm next!

624
13:38:08,000 --> 13:38:09,000
Remember now?

625
13:38:11,000 --> 13:38:16,000
Now you remember... Reema Chopra,
you, the auditorium and that panty?

626
13:38:18,000 --> 13:38:23,000
After you were through,
the entire school had fun with her

627
13:38:26,000 --> 13:38:28,000
That Reema Chopra
was a bloody whore!

628
13:38:34,000 --> 13:38:36,000
Reema Chopra was not a whore

629
13:38:49,000 --> 13:38:50,000
Hello?

630
13:38:56,000 --> 13:38:57,000
Say she was not a whore

631
13:39:02,000 --> 13:39:03,000
She was not a whore!

632
13:39:04,000 --> 13:39:05,000
Who is that, Joy?

633
13:39:05,000 --> 13:39:06,000
Say she was not a whore

634
13:39:09,000 --> 13:39:10,000
My sister was not a whore

635
13:39:11,000 --> 13:39:12,000
Joy, please talk to me

636
13:39:12,000 --> 13:39:16,000
My sister was not a whore!

637
13:39:28,000 --> 13:39:29,000
Yes, Bala

638
13:39:31,000 --> 13:39:33,000
The story is about to end

639
13:39:33,000 --> 13:39:34,000
Spring Towers, penthouse

640
13:40:13,000 --> 13:40:17,000
l didn't intend to kill Joy Fernandez.
He invited his own death

641
13:40:21,000 --> 13:40:22,000
l'm sorry, Bala

642
13:40:25,000 --> 13:40:28,000
Keep him busy, while l clean myself
of his friend's blood

643
13:41:23,000 --> 13:41:25,000
Bangkok always reminds me of Mumbai

644
13:41:27,000 --> 13:41:29,000
The same traffic din,
the same heat...

645
13:41:31,000 --> 13:41:32,000
conspiracies soaked in sweat...

646
13:41:34,000 --> 13:41:35,000
some secrets...

647
13:41:37,000 --> 13:41:38,000
and some bloody stories

648
13:41:39,000 --> 13:41:41,000
You called me over to
tell the end of the story

649
13:41:42,000 --> 13:41:47,000
You must've noticed that not one blow
from my men struck your head, Bala

650
13:41:51,000 --> 13:41:52,000
Not because you are a better fighter

651
13:41:53,000 --> 13:41:55,000
But because l forbid them

652
13:41:58,000 --> 13:42:00,000
l didn't want you to lose memory

653
13:42:01,000 --> 13:42:05,000
lt was all a lie, only to serve
my ego before my friends...

654
13:42:07,000 --> 13:42:09,000
to win a bet. But it was a lie

655
13:42:11,000 --> 13:42:14,000
For one small mistake in childhood,
you shoved me into hell for 14 years

656
13:42:15,000 --> 13:42:15,000
14 years!

657
13:42:16,000 --> 13:42:19,000
The story goes far beyond your memory
can travel, Balajeet Roy!

658
13:42:25,000 --> 13:42:27,000
How's Reema, Rohit?
- Fine. Must be in her class

659
13:42:28,000 --> 13:42:30,000
Will you do me a favour?
- What?

660
13:42:30,000 --> 13:42:32,000
Go and ask your sister if she's
willing to get laid for 15 bucks

661
13:42:37,000 --> 13:42:38,000
Wait, Rohit

662
13:42:41,000 --> 13:42:45,000
Joy, won't you return
what Bala took from her?

663
13:42:49,000 --> 13:42:52,000
So what do we get for 15 bucks?
- Reema Chopra!

664
13:43:00,000 --> 13:43:01,000
Sister!
- What happened?

665
13:43:01,000 --> 13:43:02,000
See how much we've earned

666
13:43:03,000 --> 13:43:06,000
Wonder what you give for 15 bucks
that every boy wants

667
13:43:10,000 --> 13:43:10,000
Kaka

668
13:43:12,000 --> 13:43:13,000
Hang on

669
13:43:15,000 --> 13:43:16,000
Go on

670
13:43:22,000 --> 13:43:23,000
''My sister gets laid
for 15 bucks''

671
13:43:24,000 --> 13:43:26,000
Open the door, Reema

672
13:43:27,000 --> 13:43:30,000
Open the door, Reema! You'll die
- Sister!

673
13:43:30,000 --> 13:43:32,000
Open the door

674
13:43:47,000 --> 13:43:52,000
Before l could reach her,
my sister was completely burnt

675
13:43:55,000 --> 13:43:57,000
lt took 14 years to make
a monster out of you

676
13:43:59,000 --> 13:44:01,000
Butjust that one night
turned me into one

677
13:44:03,000 --> 13:44:05,000
l kept extracting my revenge from you

678
13:44:07,000 --> 13:44:11,000
But deep within, an eight-year old boy
still screams for his sister

679
13:44:14,000 --> 13:44:15,000
l never knew...

680
13:44:17,000 --> 13:44:21,000
just a careless word from my mouth
would lead to such a horrible end

681
13:44:22,000 --> 13:44:24,000
Just a careless word?
lt took my sister's life...

682
13:44:25,000 --> 13:44:28,000
and sent you to hell
for 14 years

683
13:44:31,000 --> 13:44:33,000
Was it worth it, Bala?

684
13:44:35,000 --> 13:44:36,000
Tell me!

685
13:44:38,000 --> 13:44:41,000
Now l realise that
it was not worth it

686
13:44:44,000 --> 13:44:48,000
But Rohit, whatever l did,
l did it unknowingly. Now l ask you

687
13:44:50,000 --> 13:44:54,000
Such a grave punishment for my folly
in childhood... did l deserve it?

688
13:44:54,000 --> 13:44:56,000
Wrong question, Balajeet Roy

689
13:44:58,000 --> 13:45:00,000
You should ask me why
l set you free

690
13:45:02,000 --> 13:45:06,000
You were held captive, and it was
the justice of an eight-year old child

691
13:45:08,000 --> 13:45:12,000
Now you are released, and it is
the vengeance of a monster

692
13:45:16,000 --> 13:45:16,000
Come

693
13:45:18,000 --> 13:45:19,000
Bangkok has an interesting game

694
13:45:25,000 --> 13:45:27,000
The girl in the centre...

695
13:45:28,000 --> 13:45:30,000
is an innocent kid

696
13:45:35,000 --> 13:45:38,000
And this crowd is bidding
for her virginity

697
13:45:45,000 --> 13:45:47,000
he one who bids the highest
gets to take her...

698
13:45:50,000 --> 13:45:51,000
to the bedroom

699
13:45:54,000 --> 13:45:56,000
And he will snatch her innocence

700
13:46:03,000 --> 13:46:04,000
l'm not interested in the game

701
13:46:07,000 --> 13:46:09,000
No? You must take interest then.
- Why?

702
13:46:15,000 --> 13:46:16,000
Another gift for you

703
13:46:34,000 --> 13:46:36,000
Mr and Mrs Balajeet Roy's
happy family

704
13:46:39,000 --> 13:46:42,000
Then a storm raged, and
swept away Balajeet Roy

705
13:46:44,000 --> 13:46:48,000
The poor wife couldn't even tell
her husband that she was pregnant

706
13:46:51,000 --> 13:46:55,000
Then l walked into her life posing
as your childhood friend

707
13:46:57,000 --> 13:47:00,000
From the pregnancy to the delivery,
l took great care of your wife

708
13:47:01,000 --> 13:47:02,000
l never let anyone meet her

709
13:47:04,000 --> 13:47:06,000
Not even your family friend
Joy Fernandez

710
13:47:08,000 --> 13:47:12,000
On your daughter's first birthday,
l got your wife killed

711
13:47:15,000 --> 13:47:17,000
l heaped the blame on you

712
13:47:18,000 --> 13:47:21,000
Afterwards, l raised your daughter

713
13:47:23,000 --> 13:47:26,000
And now she's a fourteen-year old
young girl

714
13:47:49,000 --> 13:47:50,000
ls she my daughter?

715
13:47:53,000 --> 13:47:54,000
ls she my daughter?

716
13:47:55,000 --> 13:47:57,000
ls she my daughter, Rohit?

717
13:47:59,000 --> 13:48:01,000
ls she my daughter, dammit?

718
13:48:03,000 --> 13:48:04,000
ls she my daughter?

719
13:48:11,000 --> 13:48:12,000
My daughter?

720
13:48:13,000 --> 13:48:15,000
Rohit please tell me,
is she my daughter?

721
13:48:42,000 --> 13:48:44,000
My daughter... my child

722
13:49:02,000 --> 13:49:03,000
My daughter

723
13:49:15,000 --> 13:49:16,000
Yes, Balajeet Roy

724
13:49:17,000 --> 13:49:21,000
Your daughter is of the same age as
my sister when she set herself ablaze

725
13:49:23,000 --> 13:49:25,000
Your daughter too will go through
a test of fire now

726
13:49:26,000 --> 13:49:30,000
The one who bids most,
will make a woman out of the kid

727
13:49:57,000 --> 13:49:59,000
He was with me for 18 years,
like a shadow

728
13:50:02,000 --> 13:50:05,000
l killed him too,
just to keep you alive

729
13:50:08,000 --> 13:50:11,000
You won't watch your
daughter's circus alone...

730
13:50:12,000 --> 13:50:13,000
the entire world will watch it!

731
13:50:15,000 --> 13:50:16,000
On the internet

732
13:50:19,000 --> 13:50:21,000
My daughter won't pay for my sins

733
13:50:24,000 --> 13:50:25,000
On DVDs

734
13:50:28,000 --> 13:50:29,000
On cellphones

735
13:51:07,000 --> 13:51:09,000
Why did you stop? Hit me

736
13:51:10,000 --> 13:51:11,000
Hit me

737
13:51:14,000 --> 13:51:15,000
But it won't save your daughter

738
13:51:22,000 --> 13:51:23,000
Hit me!

739
13:51:24,000 --> 13:51:26,000
Don't punish my daughter
for my sins, Rohit

740
13:51:29,000 --> 13:51:31,000
Save my daughter, please

741
13:51:33,000 --> 13:51:35,000
Please! l beg of you

742
13:51:36,000 --> 13:51:37,000
Please save my daughter

743
13:51:40,000 --> 13:51:42,000
l shall be your slave forever

744
13:51:42,000 --> 13:51:45,000
l'll do your bidding,
l'll be your dog

745
13:51:47,000 --> 13:51:49,000
Please save my daughter

746
13:51:51,000 --> 13:51:54,000
l'll cut my hands off!
My tongue committed a mistake

747
13:51:55,000 --> 13:52:00,000
l'll cut my tongue off!
Please Rohit, save my daughter

748
13:52:07,000 --> 13:52:10,000
My hands were too small
to save my sister

749
13:52:11,000 --> 13:52:13,000
But you can save your daughter.
Not fair!

750
13:52:14,000 --> 13:52:16,000
Please! Please

751
13:52:17,000 --> 13:52:20,000
Rohit, please tell me her whereabouts

752
13:52:22,000 --> 13:52:23,000
Please!

753
13:52:28,000 --> 13:52:33,000
Even if l tell you, you won't reach.
Because you have only 30 minutes

754
13:52:34,000 --> 13:52:36,000
l will try

755
13:52:37,000 --> 13:52:37,000
Try?

756
13:52:40,000 --> 13:52:43,000
l forgot it

757
13:52:50,000 --> 13:52:51,000
l'll kill you, Rohit

758
13:52:53,000 --> 13:52:57,000
lf you kill me, who will tell you
your daughter's whereabouts?

759
13:52:59,000 --> 13:53:00,000
Tell me her whereabouts, Rohit

760
13:53:07,000 --> 13:53:09,000
Your daughter is being plundered
in this very whorehouse

761
13:53:12,000 --> 13:53:14,000
She is getting fucked!

762
13:54:04,000 --> 13:54:07,000
l can save your life
for my daughter's sake, Rohit

763
13:54:13,000 --> 13:54:16,000
l have achieved my purpose in life.
- No, Rohit

764
13:54:17,000 --> 13:54:20,000
Just one word!
Give it to me in alms, please

765
13:54:21,000 --> 13:54:24,000
l got one last shot left.
- Please Rohit

766
13:54:24,000 --> 13:54:25,000
Last and final blow

767
13:54:28,000 --> 13:54:31,000
Don't let go, Rohit. Please.
- l'll wait for you in hell

768
13:54:34,000 --> 13:54:35,000
See you in hell.
- Rohit, please

769
13:55:06,000 --> 13:55:08,000
Bala! What happened?

770
13:55:13,000 --> 13:55:14,000
He...
- What?

771
13:55:22,000 --> 13:55:23,000
My daughter

772
13:55:24,000 --> 13:55:25,000
What...?

773
13:55:42,000 --> 13:55:43,000
l know that place, Bala

774
13:56:37,000 --> 13:56:38,000
Where's my daughter?

775
13:56:39,000 --> 13:56:40,000
l don't know

776
13:56:44,000 --> 13:56:45,000
Upstairs

777
13:58:43,000 --> 13:58:44,000
Hello?
- Papa

778
13:58:52,000 --> 13:58:53,000
Where are you?
- At home

779
14:00:02,000 --> 14:00:05,000
Rohit spared my daughter.
And that was his last blow

780
14:00:08,000 --> 14:00:09,000
Perhaps he too had a heart

781
14:00:11,000 --> 14:00:13,000
Perhaps he saw his sister
in my daughter

782
14:00:14,000 --> 14:00:18,000
That's probably why he
named her Reema
