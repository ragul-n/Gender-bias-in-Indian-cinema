00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,960
"After reaching the shore"

2
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,920
"I love the sea."

3
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,560
"After the hair greys"

4
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,760
"I understand the world."

5
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,960
"Yesterday's joys come together"

6
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,400
"Today, at this moment,"
they find meaning."

7
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,200
"Today's joys will come together"

8
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,640
"To find their
meaning tomorrow."

9
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:48,040
"To live my life
that I never lived."

10
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,520
"Unable to bear this, upwards I go"

11
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,200
"To kindle my never ending passion."

12
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,560
"Here and now, I am coming out of it"

13
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,760
"Here and now,
I immerse into the depths"

14
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,080
"I look at myself
as someone else."

15
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,640
"Not with any reason,
just naturally."

16
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,760
"With clarity, like
that of a sunray!"

17
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,560
"I dont belong to these depths,
but I dwell in them."

18
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,160
"As a mirror I am born"

19
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,360
"I become everything I see."

20
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,400
"The joy of a kitten's
caress on my feet"

21
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,800
"Is a life enough for me."

22
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,240
"I want to stroke, everything I
come across, beautifully!"

23
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,960
"I will always be myself."

24
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,840
"Every day I will
live to the fullest"

25
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,760
"Will object, a life
of conventions."

26
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,400
"I will live a life
of supreme essence!!!"

27
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,280
"I will become as
pure as possible."

28
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,000
"With the wind flies the Hawk."

29
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,440
"Beautifully, without a path."

30
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,600
"It being its own reality."

31
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,320
"Like the rock that goes to
the depth of the waters"

32
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,120
"With a renouncing of sound"

33
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,960
"I drown in the sights I see."

34
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,080
"Like the bird that rides
on the bull's hump"

35
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,520
"I will live upon the Earth."

36
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,960
"I would join hands,
and walk along with the Earth."

37
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,960
"Some kind of ecstasy is flowing"

38
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,560
"That provides depth!!!"

39
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,160
"This moment envelops like a mother"

40
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,560
"Singing a lullaby"

41
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,840

"After the hair greys"

44
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,560
"I understand the world."

45
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,880
"Yesterday's joys come together"

46
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,360
"Today, at this moment
they find meaning."

47
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,080
"Today's joys will
come together"

48
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,880
"To find their meaning tomorrow."

49
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,760
(Priest's chants)

50
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,760
Come.

51
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,880
Come, all of you.

52
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,960
Good morning

53
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,160
Greetings.

54
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,040
Greetings sir.

55
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,520
What's the time?

56
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,120
8:59 am.

57
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,920
9 to 6, in 36 frames, we are going to
click photographs in your digital camera.

58
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,000
No preview.
No deleting, if you find a mistake.

59
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,760
We need to know
what's your mistake.

60
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,640
9 to 6, no one should to talk to each
other, no chatting, no whatsapping.

61
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,600
Okay, sir

62
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,800
Every frame that you capture
should be one that you admired...

63
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,640
and not what you took
to impress others.

64
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,000
- Hey ! call out!
- Focus!

65
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,160
I got it sir, I got it.

66
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,520
Sir...

67
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,360
Good

68
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,120
Only photography, possess
the quality to freeze time.

69
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,800
Prabha, in that photo of
mine which you clicked...

70
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,280
whenever I see it,
I will be 37 only.

71
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,040
So make it count

72
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,280
Leave the moment

73
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,000
Sir, one selfie with you

74
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,280
A selfie with me itself is it?

75
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,720
Hey! Don't overlap.

76
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,040
Does anyone know how to drive?
I have not had enough sleep.

77
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,360
 Sir, I know

78
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,000
I can drive.

79
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,720
Are you sure?

80
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,120
Okay be ready tomorrow morning.

81
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,400
Okay, sir

82
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,520
Hey!

83
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,960
I will wake up in the
middle and check

84
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,240
If you cross 100km, you had it!

85
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,760
- Okay, sir.
- Got it?

86
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,760
Listen! If you feel sleepy, do tell.

87
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,520
Don't just go bang it. Okay!

88
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,200
Thanks

89
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,800
Thanjavur sir.

90
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,920
You were fast asleep sir.

91
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,280
That's why I did
not wake you up.

92
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,640
Some problem in Kollidam bridge.

93
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,440
That's why we have to go through
Thanjavur and then Trichy.

94
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,520
Google maps are on.

95
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,680
Go straight.

96
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,880
Google says left.

97
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
Don't listen to that.
Listen to me.

98
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,360
Go straight.

99
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,680
Okay, sir

100
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,480
Roll the window down.

101
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,960
Now just smell the air outside.

102
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,480
So, how is it,
the air of my native?

103
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,760
This is your native sir?

104
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,400
This is where I was
born and brought up.

105
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,040
My native!

106
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,720
See that's the old bus stand.

107
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,080
After my parents got married, this is
where, they first came and got down.

108
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,960
Look there.
That's the government hospital.

109
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,280
That's where I was born.

110
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,760
Look there, can you see that?
That's Oriental towers.

111
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,600
The first shopping
complex in our town.

112
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,640
Here on the right side.
Raju's bakery.

113
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,640
Even after you have eaten well,
your mouth will water

114
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,240
Egg puff!!!

115
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,520
Can you see a hospital there?

116
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,360
Next to that, was
where my house used to be.

117
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,920
I myself, am not able
to recognize the place.

118
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,760
Should I stop here, sir?

119
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,520
No...no, If someone sees me,
I will have to talk.

120
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,440
Do you know what that is?

121
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,880
- The Big Temple.
- Yes, who built it?

122
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,600
Raja Raja Cholan.

123
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,760
Hey, that...

124
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,200
What happened sir?

125
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,800
Can you go in full speed, and stop
in front of him and scare him?

126
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,840
Can you go in full speed, and stop
in front of him and scare him?

127
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,680
Now watch.

128
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,560
Go

129
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,800
Go...go

130
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,000
Go...go

131
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,280
Enough...enough.

132
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,240
Good morning, officer

133
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,360
K.Ramachandran.

134
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,760
Hey! Little one!!!
It's you is it!

135
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,480
No wonder!

136
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,440
I was thinking, who has so much guts
to come and run the car over me.

137
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,280
Are you fine?

138
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,080
What is this,
you started off well no

139
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,440
Why you suddenly
giving me respect?

140
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,800
You better go back to
calling me like old times!

141
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,000
You still haven't stopped charming
people with your laughter!

142
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,560
Come let's go drink tea.

143
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,360
How come your here?

144
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,240
Because...

145
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,720
I am going on asking you,
and your looking elsewhere.

146
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,360
Uncle! Shall I just go and
take a look around school?

147
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,360
Oh! no! that's very difficult!

148
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,480
That's not possible.

149
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,280
First you have to get the
principal's permission.

150
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,440
Then you have to get the
signature of your parents.

151
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,200
Are you serious?

152
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,440
Hey! What is this unusual question?

153
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,800
This is your school.
Go and see it.

154
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,920
K.Ramachandran.

155
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,480
That's me!

156
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,160
When did you come?

157
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,480
Just now.

158
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,600
Just take that stone little one.

159
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,080
I just, got carried away
by the old memories.

160
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,760
I took out,
without breaking it.

161
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,560
Thank you

162
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,520
You remember,
your friend, who stuck to you.

163
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,560
From philomina nagar

164
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,000
- Are you still in touch with him?
- No

165
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,880
Because of work

166
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,440
There's just no time.

167
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,920
This is a photograph
of the school , is it?

168
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,360
Hello!

169
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,200
I am All Saint's School,
watchman speaking.

170
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,360
Oh! Protector!
How are you?

171
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,160

172
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,480
Murali, how are you?
I am your protector only speaking!

173
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,200
I am fine

174
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,080
We were just talking about you.

175
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,240
Ram just dialed your
number.

176
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,960
What about you?

177
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,280
Am fine darling.
How are you?

178
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,960
Everything will happen only
according to one's fate .

179
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,840
Just concentrate on your work.

180
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,280
Little one, Murali wants
to talk to you.

181
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,400
Hey! Savage!

182
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,960
What are you doing there?

183
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,640
Actually, I don't know.

184
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,640
What sort of answer is this.

185
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,560
How's school?

186
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,080
Dude...!

187
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,680
Is it still the same or
have they rebuilt it?

188
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,120
Dude! It's just like before.

189
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,400
Same building, same table,
same chair, same protector!

190
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,520
Hey! Let's do a video call!

191
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,120
What rubbish!
what's keeping you so busy?

192
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,760
Come here and see it.

193
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,000
Hey! call please!

194
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,960
Dude! This is a feeling.
Come and see it live!

195
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,760
Isn't it around 10 to 15
years since we passed out?

196
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,120
- Excuse me!
- School is exactly the

197
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,680
 What you saying 10 to 15 years?

198
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,280
Fat hopes, one whack,
I will give you.

199
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,080
You and me completed
school in'96

200
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,680
Now it's 2016.

201
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,960
Do you know subtraction,
or should I do it?

202
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,400
Hey! Twenty years,
has gone by is it?

203
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Holy smokes!

204
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,560
Didn't even realize it.

205
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,120
Yes, dude! We have grown older.

206
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,200
Now why you reminding me about that.

207
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,840
At least who have seen
a lot of places

208
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,000
I haven't stepped
outside Tamil Nadu.

209
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,600
Okay, let that be, we have a
lot left to experience, dude!

210
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,720
I will prepare the list,
when are you coming to Chennai?

211
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,480
Okay listen to me carefully.

212
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,520
I am coming from Thanjavur.

213
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,520
After I reach, I will
come and see you.

214
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,560
I have to write it in water,
your empty promises.

215
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,240
Okay, what's with the
sudden visit to Thanjavur?

216
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,680
I will come and tell
you about that.

217
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,480
Do you have any of
our friends numbers?

218
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,800
I want to call and talk to them.

219
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,440
Hey! Crazy brother!

220
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,880
It will take ages, to get
everyone's numbers and talk to them

221
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,840
Then?

222
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:21,640
Why you worried, we have the
useless, school whatsapp group!

223
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,280
Who do you think is
the admin for that?

224
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,080
Who else! It's you dude.

225
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,040
Even in school you were the one.

226
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,120
Now, no one can beat you to it.

227
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,240
- Hey! say that when you among people.
- Okay dude.

228
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,680
Now I will add you to the group.

229
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,160
Thanks, dude.

230
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,560
Welcome back to school
Mr. K.Ramachandran.

231
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,120
May I come in, please?

232
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,000
Hi, you late comer.

233
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,360
Hi, friends

234
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,600
Dude!!!

235
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,440
Hi, Ram

236
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,880
Hello! Photographer

237
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,840
The Lion has entered the arena!

238
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,640
Oh! look who has joined!

239
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,000
Hey Savage, where were
you all these days?

240
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,960
No matter what, a hero is
a hero, a comedian is a comedian!

241
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,720
No one bothered
when I was added to the group.

242
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,560
You're not on any social network

243
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,520
How come you came onto the group?

244
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,840
I had gone to our
school this morning

245
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,600
After I saw our classroom and our playground
I just felt like talking to all of you.

246
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,160
Now I feel like
seeing all of you.

247
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,600
Hey! Ram! Even feel
like seeing you.

248
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,920
The groom himself has spoken.
We are definitely meeting.

249
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,960
As a Ram say
we all should meet our sometimes

250
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Hey! now you want to see all of us

251
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,960
Is it not?

252
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,320
Here, take a look !

253
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,880
Hey Ram

254
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,200
Post a current photo of yours

255
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,640
Let's see how you look.

256
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Hey! handsome!

257
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,440
Cannot recognize you at all.

258
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,880
As though we are all
growing younger

259
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,400
That's why he wants
to see everyone.

260
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,880
Admin is typing

261
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,760
Then definitely there will
be some important message.

262
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,120
I'm waiting

263
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,000
We are the'96'batch

264
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,720
It's been 20 years
since we passed out

265
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,520
I feel it would be great
if we have a reunion.

266
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,320
Everyone will get an opportunity
to see each other as well.

267
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,040
Super idea

268
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,960
I vote

269
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,520
Awesome dude!

270
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,200
After all I am the class leader!!!

271
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,640
Superb idea!

272
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,000
Oh! now I have to say something!

273
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Hey Murali!

274
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,400
You're too cool!

275
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,240
Hey!

276
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,600
Since all of us are online,
let's fix the place also now!

277
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,040
Thanjavur?

278
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,640
Then why not at Thiruvarur

279
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,280
Nonsense

280
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,040
Are we conducting
a classical music concert!

281
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,920
Look, just a few of you are in Thanjavur

282
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,520
Most of us are in Chennai

283
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,880
The rest have ran away
to US, UK, Australia

284
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,560
Then is Chennai, fine?

285
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,440
Super

286
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,960
Chennai is fine.

287
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,800
That will be easy for everyone.

288
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,320
Then, when?

289
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,600
That's what matters

290
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,800
Carefully plan that.

291
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,160
Half the people will promise
to come, later on ditch us.

292
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,160
Definitely keep it
during a weekend.

293
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,560
We can also try during the holidays.

294
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,720
What's the date today?

295
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,400
Jan 7th.

296
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,800
Two months from today
is our reunion!!!

297
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,320
That would be March 7th!
In Chennai!

298
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,280
All of you better be there.

299
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,840
Double okay

300
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,080
Those who don't come
will die puking blood

301
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,080
You rocked it dude!

302
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,880
Ram we should thank
you for this!

303
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,440
Long live K. Ramachandran.

304
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,360
So, cool, everything
got fixed so fast!

305
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,640
Hey! someone tell my wife.

306
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,720
If I ask, she won't let me come.

307
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,160
Can we bring the kids?

308
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,480
It would be very difficult
to leave them and come.

309
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,600
Please come us family

310
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,440
This is the first time you guys have done
something meaningful after starting the group

311
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,680
'Two months later'

312
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,280
I don't think
I can make it

313
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,360
I really miss you

314
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,920
Hi, what's app dude
how are you doing?

315
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,920
Hello my friends,

316
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,000
I know you will be annoyed
if I speak in English like this.

317
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,440
That's Vinoth.

318
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,440
Hi!

319
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,080
- Hi!
- Hi!

320
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,920
How are you?

321
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,560
- It's been a long time.
- I'm fine.

322
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,240
How are you?

323
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,040
Idiot.

324
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,800
I told you, take the left at the
temple and then the second right,...

325
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,400
you have done the opposite.

326
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Hey! I don't know all that

327
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,640
Come back to the temple,
I can only direct from there.

328
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,160
 Hang up! hang up!

329
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,520
Dude!!!!!

330
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,240
Are you fine?

331
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,600
Come! Come!

332
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,960
Hey! why hasn't he come yet?

333
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,360
Trusting he would come,
I have ordered extra food.

334
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,200
 I had called him thrice.

335
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,520
The third time I called him, he
said he will come and hit me...

336
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
if I call him again and hung up.

337
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,640
In spite of that I
called him again

338
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,200
Wonder what he is going
to come and do to me.

339
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,680
Hey is this Gulab Jamun?

340
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,480
No, red bricks,
you want to eat?

341
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,360
He has posted a poetry
about that girl on Facebook!

342
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,280
- Is that so?
- What had he posted?

343
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,640
Geetha

344
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,440
Tell me...tell me

345
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,360
Tell me...tell me

346
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,520
Hey! hold his hand.

347
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,440
Geetha, give me the key to
open the door to your heart?

348
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,520
Hey!

349
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,640
Dude!!!

350
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,920
Wait...wait

351
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,200
Hey carry him!

352
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,720
Hey! leave me
I've grown old!

353
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,920
"If my friend asks for my life,
I will say take it!!"

354
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,400
Hey! with whose
permission did you kiss me?

355
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
Okay

356
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,680
Now go meet your darling sister,
before she gets wild.

357
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,280
I can sense someone boiling

358
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,760
Yeah right

359
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,760
You promised to come and see
me the next day itself!

360
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,640
My dear niece, your uncle has come!

361
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,440
Niece?

362
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,200
What if this one's also a boy?
Won't you accept it?

363
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,040
No way! I want a girl.

364
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,080
I have named her Iniyaval.
It's a done deal.

365
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,000
Okay, my darling!

366
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,240
Even she agrees!

367
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,840
Okay it's going to be a girl.
Now you eat the sweet.

368
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,080
Hi Sathish, how are you?

369
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,960
Now come and talk properly

370
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,760
After you are married and have kids.

371
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,600
When I used to come then and talk,
all of you, would ignore me.

372
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,000
Sir, you don't worry
she is very good girl

373
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,320
She's a very helpful girl.

374
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,880
During exams, she used to
help us copy.

375
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,960
Is it not guys?

376
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,200
Yes! Yes!

377
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,320
- Do you know where Saravanan is now?
- Where?

378
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,800
What kind of photographs are these?

379
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,600
Can hardly see the faces,
in the dim light.

380
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,440
Horrible!

381
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,480
And you call yourself a photographer!

382
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,160
Hey! has everyone come?

383
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,000
We have to order food.

384
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,120
Four of them are yet to come.

385
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,880
Three of them
have been given directions.

386
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,840
Then, what about the fourth?

387
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,120
Huh?

388
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,760
Who is the fourth?

389
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,520
Why you blinking?

390
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,120
Huh!

391
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,320
Hello!

392
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,480
Huh!

393
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,240
Come on say it!

394
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,640
Why is he acting so weird?

395
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,680
Janu!

396
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:32,080
"The fragrance of a flower
is that a melody?"

397
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:39,760
"What blossoms in a young woman's heart
is that a rhythm?"

398
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:47,440
"Heart's desires are like
the varieties in flowers."

399
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,520
"A bird's song and it's vibes"

400
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,680
"Is the dawn's welcome."

401
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,440
'For us Janu always meant singing,'

402
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,880
'But for her, singing was everything!'

403
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,800
'She used to either sing
or talk about that song.'

404
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,120
'Like the pitch, rhythm, tempo, etc'

405
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,440
'We never understood anything.'

406
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,560
Hey! wait even I am coming.

407
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,240
'Apparently, when Janu was in
her mother's womb itself'

408
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,280
'They had decided to name the
baby, after famous singers,'

409
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,320
'SP. Balasubramaniam if a
boy and S.Janaki if a girl.'

410
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,040
'Such was their family's affinity
towards music.'

411
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,040
'Wonder, what it was about that day,
they named her Janaki Devi'

412
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,600
'She never sang any other
songs, other than that of S.Janaki.'

413
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,560
'Except one!!!'

414
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,960
In all directions,

415
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,080
echoed the tamilian pride!!!

416
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,600
Hail!!! The Tamilian!!!

417
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,920
'Sometimes while listening
to certain songs on the radio'

418
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
'It sounded like Janu's
songs being sung.'

419
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,200
'Her voice her face is what,
used to come to my mind.'

420
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,600
'So it wasn't just her singing'

421
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,520
'I was fond of Janu, herself!'

422
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,280
'Even she knew that.'

423
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,560
'That was the only reason why
my attendance was a 90%'

424
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,160
'She was the reason.'

425
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,960
'We have literally been studying
together from our kindergarten days.'

426
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,920
'From then till today, I always
listen to whatever she says!'

427
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,040
'Even she used to ask only me,
if she wanted anything.'

428
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,320
'There were days I used
to be sad,...'

429
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,320
'mulling over my poor marks
and other things.'

430
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,400
'No one else would have noticed,
but Janu would come to me,'

431
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,080
'and just ask, what happened?'

432
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,400
'That was enough!'

433
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,400
'That one word had
the power of ten elephants.'

434
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,440
'It set my heartbeat racing!!!'

435
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,360
'Spirited enough to go bash up
a bunch of harmless guys.'

436
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,960
'I really can't explain
what Janu meant to me'

437
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,520
'The only thing I would pray for,
when I go to the temple is'

438
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,600
'God!'

439
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,160
'Always keep Janu
within my eyesight!'

Cell means small

456
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,120
It can basically,
functionally, biologically

457
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,440
Also known as,
living organisms

458
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,240
Why, you are looking so grumpy?

459
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,920
Mr.

460
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,280
Hello, Mr...

461
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,400
I am asking you only.

462
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,240
Janu has not come.

463
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,560
Don't know why.

464
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,440

Call her.

485
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,320
Hey! hey

486
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,280
Today we are going to see
respiratory system

487
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,880
Respiratory system is...

488
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,360
Hey! call Subha.

489
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,880
(Indistinct chatter)

490
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,120
Your brother is calling you.

491
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,120
What?

492
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,640
Where is Janu?

493
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,680
I don't know.

494
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,240
I will kick you.

495
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,480
Kick me? You think my hands
will be plucking flowers is it?

496
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,840
You're the one who is always
with her, don't you know?!

497
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,520
I don't know.
How will only I know?!

498
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,480
Even I am always
with you, is it not?

499
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,560
I don't even know
where her house is.

500
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,200
Okay, you pay attention to the class.

501
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,160
If she catches us,
she will yell!

502
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,920
OH! MY! GOD!

503
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,440
He knows where Janu's house is.

504
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,800
It is somewhere close by,
near Kaveri super market.

505
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,280
It seems there will be a name
board 'Sukumar', outside her house.

506
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,760
Somewhere here only

507
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,320
Brother! Shall we leave now?

508
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,720
It's getting dark

509
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,680
If we get later than this,
mom will kill me.

510
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,680
Anyway she will definitely
come to school on Monday.

511
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,360
What happened?

512
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:36,840
Hmm

513
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,000
Why so late?

514
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,560
Special class.

515
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,880
"Oh! Darling"

516
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,720
"I will never let you go!"

517
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:55,440
"Whatever happens I won't
let my shyness go."

518
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,480
"It can rain nonstop."

519
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,040
'SATURDAY'

520
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,240
'SUNDAY'

521
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,800
I told you
It was enough.

522
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,320
'MONDAY'

523
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,280
Hey!!!

524
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,440
Go inside
You rascal!

525
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,040
Hey! Janu has come.

526
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,400
'I was seeing Janu after 4 to 5 days
and she was sick too.'

527
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,320
'If I was the same person
as I used to be'

528
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,000
'I would have run up to her and would
have enquired about her health.'

529
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,000
What happened Janu?

530
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,320
'That day I just couldn't move'

531
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,080
'Something stopped me!'

532
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,360
Now you alright?

533
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,000
'Everyone was enquiring about
her health, except me.'

534
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,720
All of you go your place

535
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,800
'I wanted to run towards her,
hold her hand and ask,'

536
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,600
'why did you not come
all these days,'

537
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,720
'and how I suffered in your absence.'

538
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,000
'But I somehow couldn't.'

539
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,360
You are having high fever.

540
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,360
Why did you come to school?

541
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,600
'Miss, I am better now.'

542
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,720
You should have taken rest at home.

543
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,320
- Subha take care of her.
- Yes Miss

544
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,240
All of you take you class work

545
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,200
'At that time I did not know how
to explain what that meant.'

546
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,280
'But as far I could understand,'

547
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,680
'that was the first love
of our class!!!'

548
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,440
'I could not figure out
what was happening within me.'

549
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,840
'But I was over flowing
with happiness inside me.'

550
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,120
'My heart was jumping with joy!!!'

551
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,400
'It made me twist my
invisible moustache.'

552
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,800
'After that I could never
converse normally with, Janu.'

553
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,880
'I felt shy and awkward.'

554
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,760
'The minute I saw her,
I began to hide.'

555
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
'I couldn't stop myself from
telling Subha about this.'

556
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,880
'Then onwards it was all about,
just eye contact.'

557
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,520
'I thought no one would find out.'

558
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,120
'But somehow Sathish found out.'

559
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,680
 Hey ! from when is this going on?

560
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,400
'If Sathish has come to know
Murali will also get to know it.'

561
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,440
You guys have hidden it from me.

562
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,600
What?

563
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,640
With your thoughts elsewhere,
don't neglect your studies.

564
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,080
You should study well, okay?

565
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,000
Do you want to ask me anything?

566
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,240
Are you scared?

567
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,760
Okay, shall I leave now.

568
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,520
What happened?
Did he say something?

569
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,880
- Did you say something?
- No.

570
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,480
Why are all of you
making so much of noise?

571
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,200
Janu, you come here.

572
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,080
Ask her to sing
'By the banks of the river Yamuna'.

573
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,360
Janu.

574
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,400
He is requesting you to sing
'By the banks of the river Yamuna'.

575
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,000
"I am a small girl, I am a flower."

576
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:05,360
"I am a lotus,
I am a new honey bowl."

577
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,480
"I am jaggery, I am a silver chariot."

578
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,000
"I am a calf,
I am the fresh rainy season."

579
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,400
Hey! I told her. She's
doing this on purpose.

580
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,200
He's asking you to sing
'By the banks of the river Yamuna'.

581
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,600
Sister, he has taken my geometry box and
wants you to sing some song.

582
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,800
I don't understand what is
so special about that song.

583
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,800
He's asking you so many times
to sing that song,

584
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,720
what are you going to lose?

585
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,120
Janu, a fan request?

586
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,040
By the banks of the river Yamuna
from the film 'Thalapathy'.

587
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,440
Please sing, the song

588
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,040
Mr Messenger

589
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,920
Please go tell Mr Fan, that
even on 'All India Radio',

590
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,360
songs are played,
only when directly requested by the fan.

591
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,480
Okay!

592
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,120
Murali!

593
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,720
Is it okay?

594
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,040
Now watch the fun!

595
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,080
"The eyes that spill
poetry, shut !"

596
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,880
"The feet sing a colourful song!"

597
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,720
"In Lord Kannan's chariot with desire!"

598
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,560
"Yearning drowns in blissful toddy!"

599
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,160
"In love"

600
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,920
"Inside the love nest"

601
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,080
"the love bird caresses!"

602
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,760
'After that,
I tried so many different methods,'

603
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,360
'asking her,
but she never sang that song.'

604
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,040
'Stubborn donkey!'

605
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,640
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

606
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,000
Have some chocolates.

607
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,200
Did you go to the temple?

608
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,560
Yes, I went in the morning itself.

609
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,360
Where is your brother?

610
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:42,920
Wait! wait!

611
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,560
Where did you buy your dress?
Maharaja stores?

612
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,360
No, from Kurunji stores.
Dad's choice.

613
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,440
Okay

614
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,800
Now turn.

615
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,320
Have a chocolate.

616
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,040
Take another one.

617
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,520
No, it's okay.

618
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,040
 You have grown like a buffalo

619
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,040
How will one be enough for you?

620
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,000
Take another one.

621
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,840
Hey! don't let him go.
He will hit me!!!

622
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,360
Thank you.

623
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,800
Thank you, is that it?

624
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,560
What is the occasion today?

625
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,520
Won't you wish me?

626
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,200
Happy...happy

627
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,080
Happy what?

628
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,520
Happy Diwali is it?

629
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,120
Happy birthday

630
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,960
Thanks

631
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,800
Why you sweating so much?
What did anyone do to you now?

632
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,440
Leave me.

633
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,320
Hey! my brother's a sportsman,
that's why he's sweating.

634
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,520
Is it not?

635
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,600
What happened?

636
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,040
Hey! why is your heart
beating so fast?

637
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,000
What happened?

638
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,800
Just keep your hands
and check for yourself.

639
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,560
Hey! brother!

640
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,040
Hold him! hold him!

641
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,040
You go get water.

642
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,360
Hey! get up!

643
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,800
'Subha couldn't understand, why I was so
fascinated by Janu, that I fainted.'

644
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,400
Shame on you, to faint
in front of a girl.

645
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,280
Disgraceful!
Get up!

646
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,240
'Janu couldn't understand,
what she had done,'

647
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,680
'for someone, to be so
madly in love with her!!!'

648
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,200
'But, I K.Ramachandran
of the 10th standard,'

649
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,680
'had no such confusion, even
in that exhausted state.'

650
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,800
'Like a straight line
drawn with a scale,'

651
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,600
'my focus was only on Janu.'

652
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,000
'If I get married to Janu, you
know what her name will be?'

653
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,960
'Janaki. Ramachandran.'

654
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,280
Janu

655
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,040
'Everything was moving
along smoothly.'

656
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,120
- Miss...Please...don't do this.
- Come here.

657
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,240
Please don't do this...

658
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,920
How dare you copy!

659
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,720
Sorry, Miss

660
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,120
Mr. Ramachandran, so our
holidays start from tomorrow.

661
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,840
I wonder, how you're going to
stay without seeing me for two months.

662
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,920
- Hey Janu ! come fast!
- What is this Subha...

663
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,640
Still addressing her by her name

664
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,520
You have all the rights to address her
as your sister-in-law!!!

665
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,240
Okay! I know what is what.
Now you come and take your cycle out.

666
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,400
Come fast.

667
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,480
Okay then, I will leave now.

668
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,760
Don't forget me.

669
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,080
Happy holidays

670
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,560
How do you know she's coming?

671
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,280
I have been incessantly messaging and
calling her for the past one week.

672
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,640
Not a single reply from her.

673
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,600
I got annoyed and
stopped calling her.

674
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,560
Then?

675
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,320
Suddenly she texted this
morning, saying, she's coming.

676
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,080
- You didn't even tell me this
- Hey...

677
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,960
It's not like I did
not want to tell you

678
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,520
She's got to come all
the way from Singapore.

679
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,480
Thought I'd just wait
till she reaches here.

680
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,320
Come here.

681
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,520
Look at him,
still behaving like a 10th standard kid.

682
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,600
Only thing missing is the school uniform.

683
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,440
Come here, or else I
will break your hand.

684
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,120
Dude, like you're a saint.

685
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,920
Hey! Janu has come.

686
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,160
Hey Janu, how are you?

687
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,280
Here take this and share
it with everyone.

688
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,520
Yeah, say thank you

689
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,000
Thank you

690
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,920
Hey! Subha has come, go see her.

691
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,720
What dude?

692
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,560
 Sorry got a little delayed.

693
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,680
Thank God!
You at least came now.

694
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,280
This itself is a relief.
Come.

695
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,760
Finally I've come,
you happy now.

696
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,040
How are you?

697
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:26,880
I am fine.

698
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,120
- How are you?
- Come, sit.

699
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,480
I am fine.

700
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,720
How many months now?

701
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,960
7 months.

702
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,720
This is my second one.

703
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,960
I never expected so
many of them to come.

704
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,320
All your doing is it?

705
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,240
Everyone did their bit.

706
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,320
Don't even ask.

707
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,640
Even I never expected.

708
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,400
I thought they would just nod in
agreement, and then ditch us.

709
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,480
Thank God, I had organized
some extra food.

710
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,920
Everyone has come.

711
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,280
He has had so many
ice creams from the time we came.

712
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,360
Hey! just ask him how many...

713
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,440
Go

714
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,480
I never thought you would come.

715
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,200
Hey! buffalo!

716
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,200
Hey! why you behaving like a kid?
Standing here with a balloon.

717
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,280
Come.

718
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,360
You go.

719
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,760
You come.

720
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,760
You go.

721
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,840
Janu has come.
You come now.

722
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,800
You go.
Go.

723
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,040
- Hey! shut up and come.
- Hey! you go.

724
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,480
Hey! I have grown older!

725
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,240
And you're hitting me like,
you used to in school.

726
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,000
Leave now or...just leave.

727
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,280
Get lost, you savage!

728
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,280
Get lost!

729
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,080
Last summer we were in Singapore,
my husband and son.

730
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,200
If I had known you were there, I would
have definitely come and met you.

731
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,680
Do you have a photograph
of your daughter?

732
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,920
Show me...

733
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,000
Hey! where is he?

734
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,040
If I call him, he's hitting me,
you go call him, yourself.

735
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,280
Hey! what is this..

736
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,640
What happened?

737
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,240
Hmm...

738
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,400
Ram has come.

739
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,080
He is hiding over there.

740
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,640
Hey, Janu

741
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,480
- Hi
- Hi

742
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,160
How are you?

743
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,520
- I am fine.
- How are you?

744
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,960
- Hi, Janu
- Hi, Janu

745
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,880
You didn't respond to my greeting

746
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,120
Sorry...sorry

747
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,960
How was the Vaitheeswaran temple?

748
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,560
It was nice.

749
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,640

772
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,400
Miss, you never called out
K.Ramachandran's name.

773
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,880
His name is not in the register.

774
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,960
Maybe he is in some other department.

775
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,160
 Check it during the interval.

776
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,200
He's not here also.

777
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,040
I thought he would
be in your class.

778
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,680
K.Ramachandran

779
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,440
He has taken his
Transfer Certificate.

780
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,960
Did you not know?

781
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,160
Why would he have taken the
Transfer Certificate?

782
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,080
Hey! you call him your
brother, don't you know?

783
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,840
I promise I don't know anything.

784
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,360
I came back from Kumbakonam
only this morning.

785
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,720
Why, without telling us?
Just can't understand

786
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,400
Hey! nothing to worry!
Let's go to his house in the evening,

787
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,000
Then everything will be clear.

788
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,280
Brother!

789
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,720
What you doing there? It's locked.

790
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,360
Ram?

791
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,280
What?

792
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,800
Krishnamoorthy uncle!

793
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,800
 Isn't there anyone in the house?

794
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,200
Krishnamoorthy is it?

795
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,600
How do I tell you that!

796
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,600
Apparently his dad was
in a lot of debt and...

797
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,200
wasn't able to return the money.
So they had to sell the house.

798
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,880
It was built by his grandfather.

799
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,880
So, they did not
want anyone to know.

800
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,760
That's why, they packed their bags
over night and left to Chennai.

801
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,840
 No one knows anything else.

802
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:09,960
Really sad, even he and his mother came
to know about it only that night.

803
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,560
"Why..."

804
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:23,080
"Did he leave without
saying anything?"

805
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,120
"Why..."

806
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:33,600
"Did he not close
yesterday's chapter?"

807
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:38,520
"In the Grey skies..."

808
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:44,360
"I search for my clouds."

809
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:49,240
"The time is like a riddle,"

810
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,880
"My path is filled with tears."

811
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,440
"Far away it has gone..."

812
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,680
"The music of love."

813
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:11,080
"Every tear that drops,"

814
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:17,200
"Is my prayer in search."

815
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:22,480
"He left the town I heard"

816
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:27,800
"My eyes looked here and there."

817
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:33,200
"He left my very roots I realized"

818
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:37,640
"That truth caused mayhem within!"

819
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:42,360
"The music was over."

820
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:48,200
"Where is your silence?"

821
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:58,760
"The burden of tears are becoming
my eternal companion."

822
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:03,800
"Tomorrow seems to burn."

823
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:09,360
"Where is my morning?"

824
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,320
"Wings are filled with rocks."

825
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:20,120
"Till I die on the ground."

826
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,960
Ram

827
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,240
Hi

828
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,560
You recognize me?

829
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,640
Janu.

830
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,440
How are you Ram?

831
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,920
I am fine.
How are you?

832
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,920
This is unbelievable, right?

833
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,720
That we would meet like this.

834
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,840
It's been 20 years.

835
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,760
No actually 22 years.

836
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:39,120
I can't recognize you at all.

837
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,800
When we saw each other
the last time,

838
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,720
you did not even
have a moustache.

839
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,440
What are you doing now Ram?

840
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,560
Travel...

841
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,000
Travel photographer

842
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,080
- What happen?
- I am ok.

843
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,040
You keep quiet.

844
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,040
Hey! I left the kid
with you for 5 minutes,

845
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,120
and look what you did.

846
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,000
Thanks

847
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,440
You want anything else?

848
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,240
You sit down.

849
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,520
- First you drink the water.
- Ok I will drink.

850
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,600
You're ok?

851
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,760
She's come after so many years
and this is what you do!

852
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,680
I slipped and fell.

853
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,360
Did he say anything to you
or the minute he saw you...

854
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,320
Sorry

855
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,120
She has come all the
way from Singapore.

856
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,720
Can't you enquire about her?

857
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,280
Instead of behaving like a kid.

858
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,920
She's married and has a daughter.
Did you ask her about all that?

859
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,440
You're a real moron!

860
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,880
Have you all eaten?

861
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,480
Why have you not eaten?

862
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,440
Normally I don't eat
anything on flights.

863
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,040
Is it?

864
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,360
Hey nutcase! Go run and
touch that tree and get back.

865
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,600
- Go!
- Why?

866
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,560
Okay.

867
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,120
Hello! Is it Dubai?

868
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,040
If you come back fast, run again.

869
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:28,960
Okay

870
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,280
Hey! What is this?

871
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,760
This is not right
am warning you

872
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:45,720
My dear sister in law,
is this a bribe for me or is it for...

873
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,200
My man's sister, take a walk slowly and
go touch that tree and come back.

874
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,440
Go.

875
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,000
Thank you

876
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,600
- You, not eating?
- No, you eat.

877
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,560
Phone

878
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,240
Hey! Answer the call.

879
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,760
Sir, yes, tell me sir.

880
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,960
Hey! What is this?
They seem to be heading somewhere else.

881
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,480
Yes sir.

882
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,520
Even I noticed sir.

883
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,840
Looks like they have picked up,
from where they left, at school.

884
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,360
Yes sir, even I feel the same sir.

885
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,520
Hope it doesn't
cause any problem.

886
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,480
We come imagining one thing
and something else happens.

887
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,440
 Nothing like that will happen sir.

888
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,640
You don't worry.

889
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,200
You haven't eaten.

890
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,480
Finish this.

891
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,280
Thanks

892
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,440
- Hey!
- Hmm...

893
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,880
What is happening there!

894
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,120
How would I know?

895
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,360
Nothing wrong will happen, no?

896
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,960
- I am not thinking about that.
- Then?

897
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,160
If something, happens
between these two here,

898
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,360
and her husband back in
Singapore get's to know...

899
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,440
If both of us being
the organizers, get caught

900
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:13,160
Then it will be a real
celebration for us!

901
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:14,880
You shut up!

902
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,760
I thank all of you,
who have come.

903
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,960
I have something to say,
to those who have not come,

904
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,760
you have missed a
beautiful opportunity in life.

905
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:32,000
We don't know when and where, something
like this will happen again.

906
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:35,920
Finally on behalf of 'The All
Saint's School', batch of'96,

907
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,160
I invite our class favourite, Janu,

908
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:42,040
on to the stage to say a few words.

909
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,320
Our golden girl!

910
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,760
Our kind hearted lioness!

911
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,280
Our Singapore, Princess!

912
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,400
Thanjavur's dancing doll!

913
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,360
We are all slaves to your songs!

914
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,080
Your walk is like a
chariot in procession!

915
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,760
When you talk it's poetry!

916
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,360
Janu, you speak my darling!

917
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,080
Hey! You keep quiet!

918
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,680
I'm so happy

919
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,600
I feel I have
become half my age.

920
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:11,440
I came thinking everything
and everyone would have changed.

921
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,960
But nothing has changed.

922
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:22,320
I feel like wearing my
blue and white uniform,

923
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,880
and go to school with
all of you again.

924
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,200
Thanks

925
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,080
Hey Janu!

926
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,720
Sing a song
before you leave.

927
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,560
I just had an ice cream.

928
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,600
That's okay.
Just sing, no one's giving you a prize.

929
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,480
Hey Murali!

930
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,600
Ask her to sing
'By the Banks of the river Yamuna...'

931
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:49,880
How can I?

932
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:50,760
Please...Please...

933
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,160
Ask her to sing,
'By the Banks of the river Yamuna'

934
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:06,920
"Without anyone saying anything
Flowers still emit fragrance."

935
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:15,520
"Without any bond
Two hearts are speaking."

936
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:23,840
"Without anyone saying anything
The bird's song oozes honey."

937
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:32,160
"Without anything
The heart tastes, as sweet as ever!"

938
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:40,240
"The water cascades through
And the world moves similarly."

939
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:48,280
"Everything runs by
Similarly time passes by."

940
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:57,360
"What doesn't stay still
Are the colours of the mind!"

941
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,120
One

942
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,440
Two

943
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,880
Three

944
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,920
Hey! Anyone's got a handkerchief?

945
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,160
Here it

946
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,040
Okay, ready

947
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,360
Hey! look here.

948
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,080
Did you see our protector?

949
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:57,400
Hey! I am asking you,
did you see our protector?

950
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,160
When are you coming back
again from Singapore?

951
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,720
It will take some time.

952
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,000
- Have you been there?
- No I haven't.

953
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,040
I like your hair

954
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,400
I like yours too

955
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:23,480
You know, with what great difficulty,
I got permission for this place?

956
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,280
It's really expensive!

957
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,320
These Chinese bulbs are expensive
too, you get them only in China.

958
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,400
These caterers...

959
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,760
My head is aching.

960
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,520
Get me a coffee on the way.

961
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,360
Shall we leave,
the car has come.

962
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,520
Let's go.

963
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,000
How long you staying in India?

964
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,680
Not staying, tomorrow early
morning is my flight.

965
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,000
What's the hurry?

966
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,440
In the last minute I did
not even get a ticket.

967
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,280
Only got a connecting flight.

968
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,560
Have to go to Trichy and board.

969
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,960
You could have planned
to stay for 4 or 5 days.

970
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:24,760
Even I feel the same now.

971
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,200
Then what, stay and go.

972
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,280
I have left my daughter and come.
She won't be without me.

973
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,520
- What's her name?
- Meera.

974
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,680
Here take a look.

975
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,400
 Hey! show me.

976
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,800
She looks very cute.

977
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,160
Hey! show me.

978
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,480
It was taken there is it?

979
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,240
Should visit these places
at least once before I die.

980
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,240
Here.

981
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,200
Hey Janu! he's checking out your
daughter, in front of you.

982
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,160
Does she look like me,
during our school days?

983
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,880
Everyone says that.

984
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,600
This is why brother,

985
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,280
you should get married
at the right time.

986
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,480
That's why you're still
looking at school kids.

987
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:17,880
He still is not married?

988
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,040
Nope

989
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,800
Who will give their daughter's
hand to a wanderer!

990
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,880
Why you still not married?

991
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:30,640
That is...

992
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,120
Because...

993
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:41,480
Dad's looking for a girl for me.

994
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,320
Hey Ram! Take the car out.
We will come.

995
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,960
Okay! Okay!

996
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,440
Finish your coffee.
I'll wait in the car.

997
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,320
Hey! You finished your coffee?

998
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,720
Your headache has gone?

999
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:54,680
Then get up.

1000
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,320
It's getting late. Give that.

1001
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,040
Come

1002
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,360
I am asking you...

1003
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,480
What's his problem?

1004
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,120
Hey!

1005
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:06,280
- All of you are with him, is it not?
- Hey! I messed up is it!

1006
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,120
I am going on asking all of you.

1007
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,520
One by one you guys are just
getting up and leaving.

1008
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,200
You're always with
him, is it not?

1009
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,320
- Dad...
- What dad?

1010
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,320
Sathish, am asking you

1011
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,400
Why is he not married yet?

1012
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,600
Since you're going with them

1013
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,320
You drop her first
and then you get dropped.

1014
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,160
What are you seeing there?

1015
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,680
Don't think too much.

1016
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,880
Go.

1017
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,400
'Intermission'

1018
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,200
Hey!
Which route are you taking?

1019
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,000
Don't you have to drop Janu, first?

1020
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,720
No, first I will drop you.

1021
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:01,560
- Hey! That's a very long route.
- No, who told you, that's only shorter.

1022
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,040
Yeah right! Adayar is closer
to Valasarawakkam and...

1023
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,400
far from St Thomas Mount is it?

1024
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:07,600
Nonsense!

1025
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,880
Shall I check Google
maps and tell you.

1026
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:10,640
No use,

1027
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:13,120
the routes he takes never
appear on the maps.

1028
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,360
Hey! Were you serious
or were you joking!

1029
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,080
I was serious only.

1030
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:27,760
Careful.

1031
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,520
Okay, bye

1032
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:34,400
Am warning you, go drop
her right now, and get home!

1033
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,400
- Understood?
- Don't have unnecessary thoughts.

1034
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,960
Just a few words,
till I drop her, that's it.

1035
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,200
Don't you know me.

1036
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:40,800
Get lost!

1037
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,520
Look at you and your white teeth.
Stop grinning like an idiot.

1038
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,880
Bye

1039
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,200
See you

1040
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,080
Be careful.

1041
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,120
Will let you know once
the baby is born.

1042
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,720
Sure, do let me know.
Keep in touch.

1043
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:54,280
Okay.

1044
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,920
- Bye, take care
- Bye

1045
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:02,720
Hey!

1046
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,320
Will kill you, you rascal!!!

1047
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:18,400
So you will talk to me, only
if Subha is not around?

1048
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,240
Ram.

1049
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,040
Why are you
still not married?

1050
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,200
What's the hurry! I'll, slowly...

1051
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,200
Ram

1052
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,760
Am seriously asking you.
Why haven't you married as yet?

1053
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,560
Let's say no one came forward.

1054
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:48,000
I am begging you Ram, please tell me.

1055
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,240
Even if it's because of me
it's okay,

1056
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,080
just tell me.
I need to know.

1057
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,000
Tell me, why haven't
you married as yet?

1058
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,760
Ram.

1059
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,360
Are you going to
tell me now or no?

1060
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,840
Janu, we have
reached your hotel.

1061
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,040
Ram, are you going
to drop me now?

1062
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:25,960
No...no...

1063
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,720
Subha told me to...

1064
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,720
Don't you feel like
talking to me at all ?

1065
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,000
No... no..nothing like that.

1066
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:36,720
I will pick you up in the morning
and drop you at the airport.

1067
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,600
Take my number.

1068
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,240
Janu, am not purposely...

1069
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:11,240
"Beautiful memories are becoming bitter."

1070
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:17,200
"Won't my distances ever vanish?"

1071
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:24,360
"Yearnings of my soul
are tearing me apart!"

1072
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:30,680
"Won't the past ever return?"

1073
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:37,400
"Looking and yet not looking"

1074
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:44,280
"Will my heart, forever live like that?"

1075
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:50,640
"The cowardice of words are like..."

1076
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:57,120
"The harp without a melody."

1077
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:03,840
"Beautiful memories are becoming bitter."

1078
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:10,520
"Won't my distances ever vanish?"

1079
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,040
"Within the principles of love..."

1080
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:12,760
"The rules are changing..."

1081
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,880
"Emotions are taking over!!!"

1082
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:22,600
"My burdens are
disappearing into thin air."

1083
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:25,840
"The destination seems to
have a hundred paths..."

1084
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,000
"To become one with you!!!"

1085
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:36,000
"Shall I bask as the
moon of your love?"

1086
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:42,680
"To be cheated in the break of dawn?"

1087
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:48,920
"In this glorious night, come and live..."

1088
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:55,920
"Hoping the dawn that
breaks is ours my love!!!"

1089
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,160
What is it, Janu?

1090
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,240
Ram...

1091
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,280
Have you left?

1092
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,000
Tell me Janu, you need anything?

1093
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:20,200
No, where are you?

1094
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,920
Janu?

1095
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,280
Have you gone too far?...

1096
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,840
Have you gone too far, Ram?

1097
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:33,200
I've been standing right
where I left you!!!

1098
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:22,480
Is it wrong, that I
wanted to talk to you?

1099
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,680
Sorry

1100
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:25,680
22 years!!!...

1101
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,440
Hey!

1102
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:43,720
Thanks

1103
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:47,440
Janu...

1104
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,680
Now tell me, where
do you want to go?

1105
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,560
- Yes Subha?
- Where are you?

1106
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,960
- Near Guindy.
- Have you dropped her?

1107
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,840
Yes. Dropped her
and am on my way.

1108
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,320
Did she say anything?

1109
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,480
Not really, as she was just
enquiring about my parents,

1110
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:10,480
we reached the hotel,
I dropped her and left.

1111
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:11,800
Oh! Okay.

1112
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,680
Alright! you don't keep thinking about
anything, go sleep.

1113
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,360
I'll call you in the morning.

1114
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,200
Hello

1115
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,320
Where you?

1116
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:33,160
I... I am in my room.

1117
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,040
What time is your flight
tomorrow morning?

1118
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,040
5.50 am.

1119
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,880
You're going to Trichy and
leaving from there, is it?

1120
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,200
Yes, from here to Trichy,
there to Singapore.

1121
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:44,280
Okay, call me after you reach.

1122
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,480
- At least text me.
- Okay, sure.

1123
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:47,760
Okay, bye

1124
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:57,320
Now tell me, where shall we go?

1125
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,160
Let's go somewhere.

1126
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,280
Somewhere...?

1127
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,480
I really don't know,
you suggest.

1128
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,840
Why you asking me?

1129
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:08,000
How will I know?
Go, anywhere.

1130
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,520
In moment of bravado, I asked you out.

1131
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,960
Honestly, I've never been anywhere.

1132
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,680
You better suggest,
where to go.

1133
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,560
Shall we go to a salon?

1134
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:22,840
Salon?

1135
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,320
"If you go inside the Nesapakam market,
the road will curve towards the left,"

1136
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,680
then it divides into a fork,

1137
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,160
take the right there.

1138
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,520
Stop intruding,

1139
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,320
then how can you hear
what I am saying.

1140
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:38,000
So, after you take the right at the
fork, take the second right,

1141
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,800
you will hit a corporation bank.

1142
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:42,000
On the same road,
it's the third house.

1143
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,320
If you go ring the bell,

1144
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,520
a nice, plump woman, will
come and open the door.

1145
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,680
That's the owner's wife.

1146
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:48,840
Yes.

1147
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,000
Oh! the water is it?

1148
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:54,440
It will be red in colour.

1149
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,680
In Nesapakam, that's how the
colour of the water will be.

1150
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,000
If you want crystal clear water,

1151
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,960
you have tolook in places like
KK nagar and Valasarawakkam.

1152
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,880
- Did you cut your hair anywhere else?
- No!

1153
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,520
Okay, I'll talk to you later.
I have an serious issue to deal with now.

1154
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:04,640
- I know him from long back.
- I'll speak later

1155
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:05,800
I know him from long back?

1156
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:06,880
Is that how you would say it!

1157
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,320
Shouldn't you say, you know me,

1158
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:09,920
even before your beard blended
with your moustache?

1159
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,760
His father used to bring
him here, as a little boy,

1160
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,040
and tell me to
cut it really short,

1161
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,560
and this one, used to tell
me to keep it long.

1162
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:15,800
When he was new to Madras,

1163
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,320
whenever he saw a Thanjavur bus,

1164
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,440
he used to come here
and sit with a long face.

1165
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:20,440
Brother!

1166
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:22,480
Crazy boy!

1167
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,400
Okay, tell me, how
should I cut his hair?

1168
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,160
Like actors, Rajini or Kamal?

1169
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,280
Or like Vijay or Ajith or like Surya?

1170
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,400
That's why I am asking?

1171
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,920
Uncle, cut his hair,
like a 10th standard boy.

1172
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,200
I am gone.

1173
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:47,800
Which year?

1174
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,400
'94.

1175
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:51,920
Oh! okay!

1176
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,520
Oh! '94 is it?

1177
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,440
Should I really have to shave my beard?

1178
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:07,960
Where you coming?

1179
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:09,960
It's like a bear, it will
take time to sculpt.

1180
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,400
Sit and watch the fun.

1181
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:13,800
- You sit down.
- You turn this side.

1182
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,360
You have lost half your weight.

1183
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,080
Don't close your eyes.

1184
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:08,400
Okay?

1185
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:09,440
Double okay

1186
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:11,440
Okay you sit.
Let's put two plaits for you.

1187
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:12,600
Oh no! I don't want.

1188
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,280
Okay, now leave the shop
I need to close it.

1189
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,720
Okay you wait , I'll come now.

1190
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,640
- Who did you think she is?
- I am wise enough.

1191
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:22,560
I can understand everything.

1192
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,400
- What do you understand?
- I can understand.

1193
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:26,040
That's what, what
do you understand?

1194
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,360
Shall we go?

1195
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:57,440
Remove your shirt.

1196
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,400
After all you're wearing
a T Shirt inside.

1197
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,080
It has sleeves, right?

1198
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:05,600
Then remove it.

1199
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:06,800
No...hmm...

1200
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:08,280
Hey! Just remove it!

1201
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:24,120
See how this looks!

1202
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,600
You and your beard and
the worn out shirt!

1203
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,440
What?

1204
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,360
What Janu?

1205
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:47,440
Hey! hey! hey!

1206
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,480
What?!!!

1207
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:50,000
Hey! hey! Janu.

1208
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:51,120
What is it?

1209
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:54,600
Ram

1210
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:57,800
Are you a virgin?

1211
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:01,840
Are you a virgin?

1212
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:04,600
Yuck, is this way to ask, though?

1213
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:05,920
Is it true?

1214
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:09,960
After going to Singapore,
you have become spoilt...

1215
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,000
- Let's go now.
- That's alright.

1216
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,640
You answer my question.

1217
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,160
It's getting late, first
let us leave from here.

1218
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,720
- Are you going to tell me or not?
- Hey! hey! hey!

1219
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,160
My shirt is getting crushed.

1220
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:22,840
Then answer me.

1221
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,840
Thought you can evade all
my questions and escape?

1222
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,360
Now what do you want to know?

1223
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:27,400
Whether...

1224
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:34,640
Whatever be it, let's go
talk about it in the car.

1225
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:36,840
Please Janu

1226
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:40,120
Go.

1227
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:55,720
Come, stand here.

1228
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:58,600
Now, tell me.

1229
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:02,920
Okay! Let me spit this out!

1230
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,440
First swear on God, and tell the truth.

1231
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,200
Janu, one shouldn't swear
about such things.

1232
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:08,080
Liar!

1233
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:09,440
Don't I know about you.

1234
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:12,720
You would have cooked up a story,
by the time you came from there to here.

1235
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:14,800
Swear on me.

1236
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:16,240
Okay, now tell.

1237
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:38,920
Yes! I am a virgin only, Janu.

1238
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,240
Holy! Smokes!

1239
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:43,320
You insisted, so I told.
Now just leave it at that.

1240
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,560
But why?

1241
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:47,000
Because I have committed to Lord Hanuman.
Now get into the car.

1242
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:48,000
But how...

1243
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,760
Now what do you want...

1244
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,040
Oh! Now your ego is
getting hurt is it?

1245
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:54,480
Buffalo! Do you know
how old you are?

1246
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,800
Please change the topic.
I am feeling very shy.

1247
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:04,840
Okay, leave that.

1248
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,600
In all these years, have you
not fallen in love with anyone?

1249
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,280
Can't really say that.

1250
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,480
I was expecting this.

1251
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:15,840
Finally the truth is coming out.

1252
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:16,840
What?

1253
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:20,720
Girls, will really like guys like you.

1254
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,160
How did they miss out?

1255
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,520
- Guys, like, me?
- Yes!

1256
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,280
What do you mean
by guys, like, me?

1257
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,400
Hey! You're this raw, oozing
manhood, kinda guy!

1258
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:32,760
Why? Hasn't anyone told you this?

1259
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:40,640
Okay, enough of smiling,
come to the story.

1260
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,000
- There was a girl called Charu.
- Full name?

1261
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:47,040
Charumathi.

1262
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:50,000
She was my junior in college.

1263
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:52,320
Nice girl. Beautiful to look at.

1264
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,480
While studying in college, I had
no idea about her feelings.

1265
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:56,760
After college got over,
one day she called on my landline,

1266
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,160
and wanted to talk to me.

1267
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:00,600
She said, her parents were
looking out for a groom for her.

1268
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,120
I congratulated her on that.

1269
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,440
She got angry.

1270
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,880
After that she bluntly asked
if I was interested,

1271
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,240
so she could talk to her parents.

1272
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:09,320
What did you say?

1273
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:10,760
What to say?

1274
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:13,040
For me to understand what she
was saying itself was...

1275
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,480
Okay. What did you say?

1276
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,440
What do you expect me to say?

1277
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,320
I told her, that am
jobless, penniless, etc.

1278
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,920
- Then? Then?
- She was stubborn.

1279
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:22,520
I had no options left.

1280
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:23,960
Finally I told her the truth.

1281
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,040
What is that?

1282
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:27,320
I told her about you.

1283
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,120
She was silent for a while.

1284
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:34,120
Then she took a deep
breath and left.

1285
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,880
After three months, she sent
me her wedding invitation.

1286
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,160
Then she called me.

1287
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:41,480
She told, forget what
happened and come for the wedding.

1288
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,440
She said she will be
expecting me.

1289
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:45,960
Did you go?

1290
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:49,120
Whatever said and done, I am
someone she liked.

1291
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:50,120
Poor thing.

1292
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:52,080
I did not want to make her feel awkward.

1293
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:53,320
So I did not go.

1294
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:06,800
Back then,

1295
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,160
why you left without telling?

1296
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:13,360
Why did you not come to see me again?

1297
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,160
Nothing made sense to me.

1298
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:18,760
I couldn't even ask anyone.

1299
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,520
Neither could I forget you.

1300
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,280
I completely neglected
my studies.

1301
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,120
It was a miracle, that
I even passed my 12th.

1302
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:33,280
I got scared my parents
would get me married,

1303
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,080
so I completed my degree properly.

1304
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:38,800
Even then, every time I met
any of our school friends...

1305
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:40,840
I used to wait eagerly to see if,

1306
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,720
they would say something about you.

1307
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:47,200
If someone like you,
tall and dark passed by,

1308
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:50,720
I would hope, it would be you
and follow them many times,

1309
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:51,880
but in vain.

1310
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:55,760
To add to all this..

1311
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:58,720
my sister eloped
and got married.

1312
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:03,720
Two months after that,
my marriage was fixed.

1313
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:08,400
With the hatred my father was
harboring for my sister.

1314
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,840
I could not even, go and
speak to him about anything.

1315
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:13,400
Even if I had spoken,
what could have I told him?

1316
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,600
That I was in love with a
guy till the 10th standard,

1317
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,040
but I don't know where he is now?

1318
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:27,240
Even on my wedding day...

1319
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:30,960
Something within told me,
you will come for me.

1320
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:35,040
Now if I say all this, it
would sound very dramatic.

1321
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,840
Even while I was seated as a bride,

1322
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:40,080
I felt your presence
in the wedding hall.

1323
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,320
I thought, just like how
it happens in films.

1324
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:43,920
You would stop the wedding,

1325
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:47,560
and ask for your Janu.

1326
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:50,160
I was hoping you would take me with you.

1327
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,080
But, nothing like that happened.

1328
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:57,760
Only my wedding took place.

1329
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:07,280
After that I was heartbroken.

1330
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,320
Till date...

1331
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:14,000
whenever heart is heavy...

1332
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,000
my only refuge...

1333
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:18,960
is my 10th standard
K.Ramachandran's face.

1334
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,240
What happened?

1335
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:28,520
Sir,

1336
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:30,600
it's getting late,
I have to close the gates.

1337
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:37,120
If you take the car out,
I'll close the gates.

1338
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:42,120
Sit down.

1339
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:12,760
Sorry Ram.

1340
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:16,400
These are things I wanted to tell you,

1341
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,480
someday when I meet you.

1342
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:22,240
Who else can I share these things with.

1343
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,080
That's why I poured
my heart out.

1344
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:27,720
Please don't think I am trying
to make you feel guilty.

1345
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:28,480
Okay?

1346
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,120
No...

1347
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:43,520
The fact that I came to your college...

1348
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:46,040
and sent a message, saying that
I wanted to see you,

1349
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:48,240
don't you know any of that?

1350
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,720
When did you come?

1351
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:55,040
Don't tell lies, Ram.

1352
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,040
I came, Janu.

1353
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,240
Don't play the fool, Ram.

1354
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:06,320
Really, did you come?

1355
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:31,080
One minute.

1356
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:32,640
Ask her.

1357
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:36,800
Please could you call Janaki Devi,
second year Bsc computer science.

1358
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:38,360
I need to talk to her.

1359
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,840
Is it anything to do with love?

1360
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,480
No sister, it's not what you think.

1361
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,720
They both have been in
love, ever since school.

1362
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,560
There happened to be a
break in the middle...

1363
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:49,360
It's a ladies college, otherwise
we ourselves would have...

1364
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:51,040
We have come all the
way from Madras.

1365
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:52,320
Just inform her, that would do.

1366
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:54,600
Just for this, have come
all the way from Madras?

1367
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:55,600
Yes sister.

1368
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:57,200
We both are classmates.

1369
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,920
I feel bad for you guys.

1370
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,760
I will help you.

1371
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:04,560
Are you sure there
won't be any trouble?

1372
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:06,200
No nothing will happen sister.

1373
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:08,760
We just want to see her and
talk to her once. That's all.

1374
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:09,560
Please.

1375
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,120
What did you say her name was?

1376
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,520
S. Janaki.

1377
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:13,520
One minute.

1378
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:16,560
- Do you know her?
- I don't know.

1379
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:19,400
Hey! Just write her
dad's name as well...

1380
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,600
Our bad luck,
there could be two Janaki Devis.

1381
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:28,320
You leave.
What did you say your name was?

1382
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:29,480
K. Ramachandran.

1383
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,240
Hey! Where are you going?

1384
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:56,160
Janaki Devi?

1385
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,080
That's me.

1386
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,440
His name...

1387
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:04,560
There is one boy, waiting
outside, to meet you.

1388
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:12,760
What? Are you a
messenger for love?

1389
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,240
Are you coming to
college for this?

1390
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:17,520
If you're not interested
in studying, tell me.

1391
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:19,080
I will take you to
the principal and get you,

1392
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:20,520
your Transfer Certificate.

1393
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:23,200
Hey!

1394
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:26,880
Next time you come to me,
carrying such messages...

1395
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,840
I will give you one tight slap.

1396
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:41,840
She saw you from there,
and yelled at me badly.

1397
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:48,440
Don't know what the problem is.

1398
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:50,920
Maybe...

1399
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:53,400
If you had spoken to her directly,

1400
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,440
things would have
been better, I suppose.

1401
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:09,160
Just do me one more
favour, please.

1402
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:13,560
Just tell her, I will
never trouble her again.

1403
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:14,720
- Let's go.
- Hey!

1404
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:16,040
Why you being hasty?

1405
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:17,560
Let her come out,
we will talk to her directly.

1406
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,400
No need.

1407
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:20,080
No, anything could have
happened in these three years.

1408
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:21,600
The least we can do is, to
not trouble her.

1409
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:23,440
Hey, did we come so far,
just for this?

1410
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,120
Sorry, I did not
ask you, for your name?

1411
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:34,120
Vasanthi.

1412
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:35,040
Thanks

1413
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:35,840
Get on.

1414
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,360
Sir, come this side

1415
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,960
- Which room?
- 318, third floor.

1416
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:36,840
Don't come inside.

1417
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:39,440
No...no...no... I won't ...am
standing outside the bedroom.

1418
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:44,240
- Janu are you okay?
- Ram, I did not see you that day.

1419
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:48,200
I...did not see you...

1420
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:57,240
Okay...Okay...

1421
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:03,040
I swear that day, I never saw you.

1422
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:07,840
I never saw you.

1423
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:16,400
I never saw you.

1424
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:17,560
Never saw...

1425
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,800
Never saw...

1426
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:28,000
- Janaki Devi?
- That's me.

1427
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,400
Hmm...his name?

1428
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:34,200
One boy is waiting
outside to see you.

1429
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:07,360
What are you?
A messenger for love?

1430
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:09,760
Are you coming to
college for this?

1431
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:13,720
Once more, you come with
any such messages...

1432
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:16,040
I will give you one tight slap!

1433
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:43,640
If we were not meant
to be together...

1434
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:45,240
then why...

1435
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:49,680
And look at you,

1436
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,880
because of me, you're
also in this state...

1437
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:56,560
First of all, how
could I believe,

1438
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:59,040
that you would hate me.

1439
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:03,880
Whatever it was, I should have,

1440
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:05,400
waited and seen you.
I was hasty.

1441
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:08,040
That day, if only that girl had
mentioned your name...

1442
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:11,600
Everything would
have been different!

1443
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,120
It's all my fate.

1444
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:21,880
Why should we get to
know the truth now?

1445
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:25,960
What we believed to be the truth,
could have remained the actual truth.

1446
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,720
You have also been thinking about me.

1447
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,600
I would have never known
that you came to see me.

1448
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:37,160
In this pain, that is soothing.

1449
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:51,240
How come you never said
anything when you were with me,

1450
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:54,520
but out of the blue, decided to
come after three years to say it?

1451
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:57,760
Actually, every day I
used to think of it.

1452
01:46:58,360 --> 01:46:59,960
But something will stop me.

1453
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:02,560
That I am not fair skinned like Janu.

1454
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:05,120
I can't sing like Janu.

1455
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:07,680
I used to keep
thinking like that.

1456
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,640
That particular day,
I don't know what happened.

1457
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:12,520
I felt like I would die
if I don't tell you.

1458
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,200
Some courage within me that
day, like never before.

1459
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:18,800
I travelled, all the way to your college
and was standing there, for you.

1460
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:20,400
I wanted to ask you.

1461
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:23,760
How did you know I was
studying in that college?

1462
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,360
What kind of question is this?

1463
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:26,840
Somehow I know.

1464
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:28,520
But how?

1465
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:30,680
After all you were in Madras.

1466
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,200
I had different people
for everything.

1467
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,600
I used to come to know everything,
that happens to you.

1468
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:41,000
If I felt like seeing you,
I would come to Thanjavur.

1469
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:44,960
I would follow you,
from college back home,

1470
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:47,600
and if I came too close,
I would go hide.

1471
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:52,080
The only thing, that I did not know,

1472
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:55,400
was that you saw someone else and
not me that day and got angry.

1473
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:57,600
Apart from that I know
everything about you.

1474
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:00,080
What do you know?
Let me hear it.

1475
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,800
If you say anything wrong...

1476
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:05,000
Your 10th standard marks were 836.
Your 12th standard marks were 990.

1477
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:06,160
Your b'day dress you would
wear it on my b'day!

1478
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:07,120
Your favourite deity is lord Muruga!

1479
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:08,320
You stop singing after I left town.

1480
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:09,400
You wanted to study Tamil Literature,

1481
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:11,120
but your father paid up
for Bsc Computer Science.

1482
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:12,880
You did not eat
for two days because of that.

1483
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,800
Your father was never aware of that.

1484
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:18,400
I meant to say, your father
did not know, but I knew.

1485
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:22,160
In 1998 you had typhoid and,

1486
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:23,320
in 2000 you had jaundice.

1487
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,560
The timing was so bad, both the,
times was when you had exams.

1488
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,160
Remember, when you were in college,

1489
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:28,880
one curly haired loafer was stalking you.

1490
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:29,960
He who was beaten up by someone,

1491
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,880
and admitted in hospital,
which also became a police case?

1492
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:33,280
It was me, who had hit him.

1493
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:35,760
I only hit him.

1494
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:46,000
Around that time, apart from me, three
other guys were in love with you.

1495
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:47,840
Then, for your
college annual day,

1496
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:50,600
for the first time you
wore a saree and came.

1497
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,480
Dark blue in colour.

1498
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:56,400
You were scared that your
saree may come out and,

1499
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:58,040
at the same time you were blushing,

1500
01:48:58,080 --> 01:48:59,880
as though everyone was looking at you.

1501
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,440
Do you know how you looked...

1502
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:12,680
Do it once more.

1503
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:36,920
After that I saw you in a
saree only at your wedding.

1504
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:41,200
Deep purple in colour.

1505
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:50,760
Just like you had thought, I had
come for your wedding, Janu!

1506
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:00,520
I was standing in a
corner amidst the crowd.

1507
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:12,480
I just couldn't wait till
the knot was tied.

1508
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:22,720
I ran as far away as possible,

1509
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:28,120
from the wedding hall
and all that noise.

1510
01:50:58,960 --> 01:50:59,880
Coffee?

1511
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:10,280
- Come
- Hello, sir

1512
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,160
Sorry sir, is it too late?

1513
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:12,880
No, you are right on time.
Leave it.

1514
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,280
- Shall I pour, sir?
- No, no, I'll do it.

1515
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:19,600
- Okay sir
- Thanks

1516
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:39,320
Okay Janu, I'll leave.

1517
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:40,440
After you drink, get some sleep.

1518
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,800
I'll come at 3.30, you get ready
and come down. Okay.

1519
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:47,080
I want to speak to you about
something, come here.

1520
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:49,640
No...no... whatever it is, you
say it from there.

1521
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:51,240
Nonsense, come and sit down.

1522
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:01,400
It's taken me 22 years to
see this idiotic face.

1523
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:03,760
That too, just for a night.

1524
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,480
I should really
thank God for this.

1525
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,320
I will do that tomorrow.

1526
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:13,040
Don't tell me to sleep tonight.

1527
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:16,880
I want to be with you.

1528
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:18,400
I want to talk to you.

1529
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,000
That's all.

1530
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:20,920
Okay

1531
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:24,240
What?

1532
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:55,360
"Yearnings take shape and touch me..."

1533
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:57,960
"Burning the beauty..."

1534
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:03,000
"Cradling me like a mother!"

1535
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:08,360
"The language of the eyes, follow
a path which leads to the story."

1536
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:15,720
"Yearnings take shape and touch me..."

1537
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:18,080
"Burning the beauty..."

1538
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:23,480
"Cradling me like a mother!"

1539
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:25,080
"The language of the eyes,"

1540
01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:28,440
"and the language
of the lips form a never ending story."

1541
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:33,240
"Won't time become a horse at night?"

1542
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:38,880
"Same dream! Same question!"

1543
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:43,160
"Won't the skies caress
and embrace and dance?"

1544
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:49,360
"The same moon, is coming closer."

1545
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:56,720
"Yearnings take shape and touch me..."

1546
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:59,200
"Burning the beauty..."

1547
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:04,400
"Cradling me like a mother!"

1548
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:06,440
"The language of the eyes,"

1549
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:10,000
"and the language of the lips
form a never ending story."

1550
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:16,920
"Am I the fire that gets wet?"

1551
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:21,680
"Are you the raining moon?"

1552
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:27,040
"Will I be extinguished?"

1553
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:31,000
"Am I the waning musical note?"

1554
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:36,400
"Is love just a never ending dream?"

1555
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:42,760
"Is the never ending
journey not enough?"

1556
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:47,360
"Is time a question alone?"

1557
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:48,680
"That is enough."

1558
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:53,600
"My heart melts in longing to come
closer to you."

1559
01:55:54,160 --> 01:56:00,920
"Yearnings take shape
and touch me..."

1560
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,760
"Burning the beauty..."

1561
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:08,560
"Cradling me like a mother!"

1562
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:10,600
"The language of the eyes,"

1563
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:14,320
"and the language of the lips
form a never ending story."

1564
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:34,520
Oh God!

1565
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:36,720
- What happened?
- My students.

1566
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:42,720
Okay.
So, what?

1567
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:43,720
What?

1568
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,560
If they see us together...

1569
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,720
Okay, just check if they
are looking this side.

1570
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:52,720
They aren't looking, but
they are leaving now.

1571
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:56,400
But, don't they have to go out this way?

1572
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:57,480
Oh! Yeah!

1573
01:56:58,040 --> 01:56:59,640
Okay, I will go and
hide in the bathroom,

1574
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:01,320
will you call me,
after they leave?

1575
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:02,280
Please

1576
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:03,560
Thanks

1577
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:09,960
Sir this is the kitchen.

1578
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,880
- Bathroom
- Washroom is there.

1579
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:24,760
Hi, sir

1580
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:27,760
This look, is stunning!

1581
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,800
I couldn't recognize
you from there.

1582
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:31,840
I thought it was some young guy.

1583
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:33,160
What are you doing
here at this hour?

1584
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:34,480
Sir it's Abhi's b'day,

1585
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:36,880
so we came to cut cake.

1586
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:38,560
Learn everything properly.

1587
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:39,560
Okay?

1588
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:42,640
Won't your parents, say anything,
you being out at this hour?

1589
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:44,960
All of you have come
alone at this hour?

1590
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,240
Go reach home safely.

1591
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:48,000
Sir, is that your wife?

1592
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:57,800
Hey! I never said anything...
I never said anything.

1593
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:00,240
We are Ram sir's students.

1594
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:04,160
I know, he just told me.

1595
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:06,840
Actually, we had no clue
that sir is married.

1596
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:08,080
He never told us.

1597
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:11,400
I never said anything.

1598
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:14,320
Nothing like that.

1599
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:17,000
Because it was a love marriage,
we did not tell anyone.

1600
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:18,520
Love marriage!!! Is it?

1601
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:19,680
Why?
What happened?

1602
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:22,320
We can't believe that he is married even.

1603
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:24,680
And now you're saying
it was a love marriage.

1604
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,680
So mean! Why you saying this?

1605
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:30,160
Since, he is so
strict in class.

1606
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:33,360
We can't talk, we can't look at each
other, and we can't even laugh.

1607
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:36,240
Hey! That's enough!

1608
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:38,520
You will go on talking...
Leave...leave...leave now...

1609
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:40,080
- Why you threatening them?
- It's getting late.

1610
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:41,640
Come, all of you come and sit.

1611
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:57,840
Look at him ma'am, even
in front of you...

1612
01:58:57,920 --> 01:58:59,640
I will take care of
that, you continue.

1613
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:01,560
- Where did I stop?
- Shouldn't laugh.

1614
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:03,440
Oh yes, we shouldn't laugh...

1615
01:59:03,560 --> 01:59:05,200
we shouldn't even wear sleeveless...

1616
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:07,560
Even my father is better than this, ma'am.

1617
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:10,200
Okay, okay...he's like that only.

1618
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:13,080
I will tell him to be more
gentle with girls, okay?

1619
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:15,440
That's alright ma'am, but
how did sir fall in love?

1620
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:20,080
Our love started, way back
from our school days,

1621
01:59:20,240 --> 01:59:21,480
from the 10th standard.

1622
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:22,800
School days is it?

1623
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:27,400
Who proposed first, ma'am?

1624
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:34,920
Sir, you're feeling shy?

1625
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:41,840
Ma'am, when did you
accept, the proposal?

1626
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:44,080
The same day, at that
very moment...

1627
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:45,360
at once!!!

1628
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:46,680
What is this ma'am!

1629
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:49,200
For your beauty, you should have
made him, chase you for a week.

1630
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:52,760
That too sir, you could have
kept him waiting for a month.

1631
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:58,640
At that time he meant
everything to me.

1632
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:00,640
Even now!

1633
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:05,720
Please ma'am, tell us
how sir proposed?

1634
02:00:06,280 --> 02:00:08,680
We won't ask you anything else,
we will leave.

1635
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:12,040
Birthday wish, please

1636
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,960
Tenth standard, went
by very merrily.

1637
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:19,400
I was always smiling.

1638
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:23,400
After that, Ram left to Madras suddenly.

1639
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:24,920
Without even telling me.

1640
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:27,280
All the smiles turned to tears.

1641
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:30,680
Even after I joined college,
I could never forget him.

1642
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,320
It used to be very painful.

1643
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:35,320
But something within kept telling me,

1644
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:38,040
my Ram, will come one day.

1645
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:39,800
He will definitely come for me.

1646
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:44,000
Sometimes though nothing
happens around you,

1647
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:47,480
you will still have a gut feeling
that something is going to happen.

1648
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:49,040
That's how I was feeling that day!

1649
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:05,240
Excuse me, just a minute.

1650
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:08,000
2nd year Bsc Computer Science,
S. Janaki Devi,

1651
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:09,600
can you please call her.
I need to talk to her.

1652
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:10,600
Is it about love?

1653
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:11,920
Yes.

1654
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:14,240
Are you sure there
won't be any trouble?

1655
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:15,400
What's your name?

1656
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:16,440
Vasanthi.

1657
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:17,880
Vasanthi, you don't get scared.

1658
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:20,480
Just go tell S. Janaki Devi
of 2nd year Bsc Computer Science,

1659
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,720
that K. Ramachandran has come.

1660
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:25,360
Vasanthi, thanks

1661
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:34,600
S.Janaki Devi?

1662
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:40,080
Someone called K.Ramachandran
is waiting for you.

1663
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:42,680
What happened after
that, is something,

1664
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:47,040
which I yearned, that it would happen
in my dreams atleast.

1665
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:50,160
My Ram, had come in search of me.

1666
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:52,960
In one second my
world had changed.

1667
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:56,040
The minute I heard
K.Ramachandran's name,

1668
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:58,600
my entire being shook!

1669
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:01,040
I couldn't even walk,

1670
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:03,000
but, I was running.

1671
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:08,200
"Come to me my entirety!!!"

1672
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:13,000
"You ..."

1673
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:19,560
"Are my seven musical notes..."

1674
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:25,800
"My Five great elements..."

1675
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:30,640
"My heart is brimming!!!"

1676
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:35,680
"Whatever I see..."

1677
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:42,760
"Is love..."

1678
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:48,320
I was seeing him
after three years.

1679
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:50,760
The school boy face had gone.

1680
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:54,800
A Lion of a man, with a beard
and a moustache, was at the gates!!!

1681
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:56,280
For me.

1682
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:57,640
For Janu.

1683
02:03:11,080 --> 02:03:13,040
But, I had by hearted
certain questions,

1684
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:16,440
which I desperately wanted to
ask the day I see him.

1685
02:03:18,160 --> 02:03:19,360
But...

1686
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:24,280
Janu!

1687
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:48,400
"Love... Love..."

1688
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:50,760
"Is the biggest lonely companion!"

1689
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:53,240
"Come with me...
Come with me..."

1690
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:55,720
"That is more than enough."

1691
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:58,160
"Love... Love..."

1692
02:03:58,200 --> 02:04:00,560
"Till the end of life..."

1693
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:06,000
"Lets travel...
Come with me.!!!"

1694
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:08,840
Okay, enough of listening to stories.
It's getting late.

1695
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:10,920
You people should leave.
Leave...leave...leave...

1696
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:16,880
Hey! come here.

1697
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:20,880
Can't you be happy cutting a cake
at 10pm back at home?

1698
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:22,800
Is it a must to come
out and cut at 12pm?

1699
02:04:23,320 --> 02:04:25,320
Okay, leave now. Go reach
safely and text me.

1700
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:27,880
- You both look made for each other, sir.
- Shut up! Leave!

1701
02:04:28,680 --> 02:04:29,640
Chatter box!

1702
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:32,680
- Hey!
- I will take care. You leave.

1703
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,200
You want a special
invitation is it?

1704
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:34,960
Leave!

1705
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:37,040
Good night, Ma'am

1706
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:43,200
Good night, sir

1707
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:44,560
Good night

1708
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:46,080
Leave.

1709
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:05,040
Where next?

1710
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:09,720
If you won't mistake me,
I want to ask you something?

1711
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:12,520
Oooooh! What is it?

1712
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:17,000
Your hotel is far off from here.

1713
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:18,600
Okay.

1714
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:22,320
No, it's alright, let's go.

1715
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:23,880
Stop it, and just say it.

1716
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:28,440
It's just that, the
hotel is far from here,

1717
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:30,520
where as my house is close by.

1718
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:35,880
What did you think about me, Ram?

1719
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:38,520
No...no... sorry...sorry..

1720
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:40,360
I did not mean it
that sense, Janu.

1721
02:05:40,720 --> 02:05:41,760
I promise.

1722
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:43,400
That's why I was hesitant
to ask earlier.

1723
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:45,760
Okay let's go to the hotel.
Shall I book a cab?

1724
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:47,840
I promise...

1725
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:50,240
There is this woman who
tries to entice sage Vishwamitra...

1726
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:51,520
What's her name?

1727
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:53,920
Menaka.

1728
02:05:54,320 --> 02:05:56,960
Yeah, and with her there
will two more women...

1729
02:05:57,240 --> 02:05:58,480
What are their names?

1730
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:01,320
Ramba and Urvashi.

1731
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:02,360
Yeah.

1732
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:04,840
Well, we can entrust you with
those three women,

1733
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:06,720
in those same minimalistic outfits,
for a night!!!

1734
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:08,000
You won't do anything majorly,

1735
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:10,080
in fact, you will take
care of them safely.

1736
02:06:16,840 --> 02:06:19,320
That's because I've shaved off
my beard and moustache,

1737
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:20,440
you're feeling that way.

1738
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:22,160
Oh! really... and if
you hadn't shaved?

1739
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:24,240
Even then you will
feel the same.

1740
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:26,640
Okay, let's walk.

1741
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:28,360
How do we go to your house?

1742
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:36,600
Come let's go.

1743
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:45,000
That side. That one.

1744
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,760
Hey!
Any girls as neighbours?

1745
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:56,000
Yes there are.

1746
02:06:57,160 --> 02:06:58,600
Come in with your right foot.

1747
02:06:58,680 --> 02:07:00,120
You're something...

1748
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,880
K.Ramachandran's house, is it?

1749
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:32,040
- Oh no! It's become wet.
- That's alright.

1750
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:35,600
The house is nice.

1751
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:37,440
Where is the bathroom?

1752
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:39,120
Go straight and the bedroom is on the left.

1753
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:40,920
You go, I will get a
towel and come.

1754
02:08:06,680 --> 02:08:10,200
Janu, shall I leave the soap and
towel here, at a reachable distance?

1755
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,880
Why? There is one here.

1756
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:13,840
Oh! no! I have used that one.

1757
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:15,640
Do you have psoriasis
or something?

1758
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:17,200
No...no... nothing like that.

1759
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:21,680
Just dry these.

1760
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:09,360
Ram, I have to
tell you something.

1761
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:10,440
You have to listen.

1762
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:13,320
You shouldn't stay like this.

1763
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:15,000
You should get married.

1764
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:17,200
You should have a
family of your own.

1765
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:19,880
I want see your children.

1766
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:21,280
I want to pet and pamper them.

1767
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:24,080
I want to see if their
eyes have your semblance...

1768
02:09:24,120 --> 02:09:25,720
Whether their nose has
your semblance...

1769
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,160
I want to see and enjoy all that.

1770
02:09:29,160 --> 02:09:30,400
I want to see your wife.

1771
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:33,600
I want to know who your
wife is going to be.

1772
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:35,680
I want to tell her something,

1773
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:39,080
That no women will get
a gem of a guy like you!

1774
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:41,520
So she better take great care of you.

1775
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:43,400
I literally want to warn her.

1776
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:48,280
I definitely will!

1777
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,000
You want to eat?

1778
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:06,120
Shall I order something?

1779
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:09,280
Even in the hotel, you
did not eat anything.

1780
02:10:09,320 --> 02:10:10,320
Not hungry.

1781
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:13,840
I am hungry.

1782
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:30,320
Is it okay?

1783
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:34,400
It's like my mother's cooking.

1784
02:10:46,680 --> 02:10:48,080
Janu, are you happy?

1785
02:10:48,520 --> 02:10:49,480
Hmm...

1786
02:10:50,080 --> 02:10:51,280
After many years.

1787
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,080
Idiot!

1788
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:54,160
I did not mean now.

1789
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:56,680
I was asking, whether you're
generally happy in life?

1790
02:10:57,280 --> 02:10:59,520
What is this? You're asking me,
like my mother would.

1791
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:01,880
I just felt like asking.

1792
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:03,680
If you don't want to tell,
don't tell.

1793
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:10,840
It was difficult
in the beginning.

1794
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:14,960
I got caught alone in Singapore.

1795
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:17,240
I won't know what to do,

1796
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:19,760
every day I used to stand
in front of God and cry.

1797
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:23,200
But he's a very nice person.

1798
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:25,200
A very good father
to my daughter.

1799
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:29,200
Without me saying much,
he understands me.

1800
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:32,200
No problem as such.

1801
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,920
If you're asking me
if I am happy...

1802
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:40,680
I would say I am peaceful.

1803
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:49,200
But, at this moment
I feel like saying something,

1804
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:50,960
but I won't.

1805
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:03,640
Janu, you don't get up.
Just stay there.

1806
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,360
You may stumble upon something.

1807
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:07,000
Just stay there.
I will just come now.

1808
02:12:15,120 --> 02:12:19,120
"On the banks of the river Yamuna,
as the cool breeze blows..."

1809
02:12:19,200 --> 02:12:22,960
"I dance with Lord Kannan..."

1810
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:26,800
"The eyes blossom, looking at the path..."

1811
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:30,720
"Young Radha wilts."

1812
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:34,520
"The night has gone by,
the day has gone by..."

1813
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:38,120
"The King is not with me."

1814
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:42,040
"The young girl's
unblinking eyes..."

1815
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:45,880
"Search, here and there..."

1816
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:52,320
"Lord Kannan is not to be seen
in the cow herding grounds ."

1817
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:59,800
"Falling in love,
is a painful joy."

1818
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:05,240
"Lord Kannan is not to be seen
in the cow herding grounds ."

1819
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:09,120
"Falling in love , is a painful joy."

1820
02:13:09,160 --> 02:13:13,360
"Poor Radha!"

1821
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:30,040
What's all this?

1822
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:31,120
Memories!

1823
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:34,120
Wow! That old aroma!

1824
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,720
How come you have, kept all
this safely, for so long?

1825
02:13:56,280 --> 02:13:57,200
Your's.

1826
02:13:57,800 --> 02:13:58,760
Mine?

1827
02:14:00,200 --> 02:14:02,040
How did this come to you?

1828
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:04,160
Yeah, it grew legs and came!

1829
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:06,840
I flicked it.
So I can keep it as memory of you.

1830
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:08,360
But how?

1831
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:12,360
You would leave your shawl in class,
when you go for the P.T period.

1832
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:14,720
So, I kept following, planned it...

1833
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:16,120
and one day, flicked it.

1834
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:27,720
This is what I got.

1835
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:30,320
Careful...careful...careful...

1836
02:14:37,200 --> 02:14:38,360
Hey!

1837
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:40,640
- Nothing...nothing...nothing...
- Then why you snatching it?

1838
02:14:40,680 --> 02:14:41,760
Love letter is it?

1839
02:14:41,800 --> 02:14:42,520
No.

1840
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:45,160
Are you kidding me!
Poetry is it?

1841
02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:47,080
About me, is it?

1842
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:49,400
Give it to me.

1843
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:50,720
No, Janu...

1844
02:14:50,840 --> 02:14:53,000
If you read it,
you will start laughing.

1845
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:54,400
I am feeling shy.

1846
02:14:55,120 --> 02:14:56,280
Hey! hey!

1847
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:58,400
Who is going to write
poetry about me?

1848
02:14:58,440 --> 02:14:59,840
Only you will write about me.

1849
02:15:00,240 --> 02:15:01,440
Okay! You read it yourself.

1850
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:03,200
Read.

1851
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:14,600
Girl, are you a sea full of waves?

1852
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:17,160
My heart yearns, for your next wave!

1853
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:21,720
Does a fish basket and a flower
shop require an advertisement?

1854
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:24,760
Is an attendance register
required to know your arrival?

1855
02:15:25,280 --> 02:15:27,920
Apparently we will lose our
eyesight if we see the lightening.

1856
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:31,320
We lose our eyesight
if we see the lightening.

1857
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:34,840
But when I see your eyes
lightning enters me!

1858
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:38,960
But when I see your eyes
lightning enters me!

1859
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:42,160
If you belong to your mother who
carried you for ten months...

1860
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:45,440
If you belong to your mother who
carried you for ten months...

1861
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:49,360
Then you also belong to me, for I have
carried you in my heart for ages!

1862
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:04,720
Ram!

1863
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:09,120
Haven't you slept?

1864
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:13,240
Okay, come up.

1865
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:17,800
Up?

1866
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:19,600
No I always sleep on the floor.
I am comfortable...

1867
02:17:19,640 --> 02:17:20,880
Just come up.

1868
02:17:58,480 --> 02:17:59,280
Hey!

1869
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:00,920
Tell me your email id...

1870
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:02,600
your height, weight...etc

1871
02:18:02,760 --> 02:18:03,520
Why?

1872
02:18:03,960 --> 02:18:06,280
- Let's fix a girl, for you today.
- No, don't want.

1873
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:07,480
Why not?

1874
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:09,080
Look here,

1875
02:18:09,480 --> 02:18:11,360
after being in love with
a girl like S.Janaki,

1876
02:18:11,400 --> 02:18:12,720
I can't marry any other girl.

1877
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:16,240
Why not? I was also in
love with K.Ramachandran,

1878
02:18:16,280 --> 02:18:17,840
and did I not marry M.Saravanan.

1879
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,480
Everything is possible.
Tell me.

1880
02:18:21,320 --> 02:18:23,680
Postbox78@gmail.com

1881
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:29,440
Is it time?

1882
02:18:29,880 --> 02:18:31,040
Another 15 minutes to go.

1883
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:38,480
That girl told me something
at the restaurant.

1884
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:40,000
Yes, even I wanted to ask you.

1885
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:42,120
She was whispering
into your ears.

1886
02:18:42,320 --> 02:18:43,120
What is it?

1887
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:45,400
She said, sir is a very nice person,

1888
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:47,560
and to take care of him well.

1889
02:18:49,720 --> 02:18:51,720
I know very well that
sir's a nice person.

1890
02:18:52,680 --> 02:18:54,440
But, she told me to
take care of him well.

1891
02:18:55,960 --> 02:18:57,800
I don't know what
to do for that.

1892
02:19:02,880 --> 02:19:04,120
Shall we leave?

1893
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:44,280
"The night, like an island..."

1894
02:19:44,320 --> 02:19:47,400
"Is circling us..."

1895
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:52,440
"Even the break of dawn
seems like darkness..."

1896
02:19:53,360 --> 02:19:58,720
"Memories like fire
are burning inside..."

1897
02:19:59,080 --> 02:20:03,920
"The body cries, like it is death!"

1898
02:20:04,400 --> 02:20:09,840
"Separation is my bond and I melt in it!"

1899
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:15,920
"I am separating from what
breathes life into me!"

1900
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:18,840
"Like the rivers that
flow from the mountains,"

1901
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:21,760
"You flowed into my heart!"

1902
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:23,960
"In the barren land..."

1903
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:27,200
"You gave birth to a million seas!"

1904
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:33,120
"Let the dream be my only companion!"

1905
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:37,400
"The night, like an island..."

1906
02:20:37,440 --> 02:20:40,360
"Is circling us..."

1907
02:20:40,960 --> 02:20:45,360
"Even the break of dawn
seems like darkness..."

1908
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:26,640
"This lotus, in spite of being
in the pond , is lonely."

1909
02:21:26,680 --> 02:21:32,400
"The sun basks in the warmth
even when it's not day."

1910
02:21:32,480 --> 02:21:38,120
"In one path...two souls are
searching for their soul mates..."

1911
02:21:38,200 --> 02:21:43,640
"Time is again and again
placing obstacles!"

1912
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:49,000
"Living a life without you,
is that a life at all!"

1913
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:55,160
"Come my life! Life is to live!
you are the life within me...!"

1914
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:59,640
"Shall I come! Shall I come!"

1915
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:12,360
Thank you Ma'am

1916
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:22,840
Hope you have a pleasant stay

1917
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:30,760
"Every single day my
heart comes alive..."

1918
02:22:30,800 --> 02:22:33,600
"And dies that very day!"

1919
02:22:33,640 --> 02:22:36,240
"Till the end of my life..."

1920
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:39,280
"My heart will celebrate you!"

1921
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:42,440
"Even when trees fall
and nests shatter..."

1922
02:22:42,480 --> 02:22:45,280
"Birds still sing
their melody!"

1923
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:48,080
"Even when the night is over
And almost done with..."

1924
02:22:48,120 --> 02:22:50,800
"The moon still waits patiently!"

1925
02:22:50,840 --> 02:22:53,680
"The rain drops reach the sea!"

1926
02:22:53,720 --> 02:22:56,560
"The immortal love will reach Earth!"

1927
02:22:56,600 --> 02:22:59,240
"Even when by body is away from you..."

1928
02:22:59,320 --> 02:23:03,440
"My love will live with you forever!"

1929
02:23:03,480 --> 02:23:09,080
"You take leave..."

1930
02:23:52,840 --> 02:23:53,760
What?

1931
02:23:54,920 --> 02:23:57,000
Let, me stay with you for
a little more time.

1932
02:23:57,600 --> 02:23:59,160
It's already late, Janu.

1933
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:00,680
Please, Ram

1934
02:24:16,600 --> 02:24:17,960
Don't look like that.

1935
02:24:27,160 --> 02:24:28,040
Okay, hold this.

1936
02:24:28,080 --> 02:24:29,160
Where you going?

1937
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:31,280
Okay, wait, will
come and tell you.

1938
02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:48,360
I've taken a ticket for myself
on the same flight as yours.

1939
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:50,320
Till you board the flight
I will be with you.

1940
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:51,360
Okay.

1941
02:25:02,080 --> 02:25:03,520
If you cry for this...

1942
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:05,600
Wipe your tears.

1943
02:25:06,040 --> 02:25:06,880
Walk.

1944
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:14,440
Show me.

1945
02:25:17,080 --> 02:25:17,840
