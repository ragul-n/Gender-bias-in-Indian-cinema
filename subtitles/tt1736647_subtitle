00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,868
Egypt.

3
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:59,082
an unsolved mystery since man evolved,

4
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:05,515
still they've a fascination for sorcery.

5
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:12,554
keeping their dead for thousands
of years as Mummies,

6
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,198
to bring them back to life someday,

7
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:19,697
and to get hold of a wonderful
divine power in lndia.

8
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,203
a tribe in Egypt is trying to achieve it,

9
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,138
did they achieve that divine power?

10
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:30,880
total destruction of lndia and
universe in their control.

11
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:42,558
Mother! Where is father?
- He'll come, son.

12
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,849
Caesar,

13
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:47,429
my husband Mukhtar will be
coming with the pride of victory,

14
00:01:47,598 --> 00:01:48,895
go and welcome him.

15
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:20,820
Brother!

16
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:28,996
Where is my husband Mukhtar, brother?

17
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:32,502
Did he get the all powerful Trident?

18
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:36,977
Did he destroy the secret divine power?

19
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:40,016
Why don't you answer me?

20
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,684
Brother! What happened?

21
00:02:53,664 --> 00:02:56,292
Brother! Why don't you answer me?

22
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:02,594
Why don't you answer me?
Where is Mukhtar?

23
00:03:32,803 --> 00:03:38,298
My husband went to India to achieve
great power, who did this to him?

24
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:14,941
My husbands eyes would see
someday the destruction of lndia.

25
00:04:16,247 --> 00:04:20,741
From that day Fakhtooni spent
a year in darkness.

26
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,251
She was burning with to avenge
her husband's killing.

27
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:28,116
She made a plan with the help
of Egyptian sorcery.

28
00:04:28,593 --> 00:04:33,257
She did what no mother would
do on her eldest son.

29
00:04:49,614 --> 00:04:58,113
Mother...mother...

30
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:38,428
Mahadevaraya, the baby girl is
blessed by Goddess Mother.

31
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:42,999
She's born with your father's gene,
so the diamond is shining.

32
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:45,067
The future depends on her.

33
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:47,761
Swamy! Where is her saviour?

34
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:53,001
Protect her till she's 21 and
the great solar eclipse day,

35
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:57,170
in the coming future,
she'll herself bring the saviour.

36
00:05:57,882 --> 00:06:00,077
Hail Goddess Mother!

37
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,416
She placed her husband's eyes to her son.

38
00:07:08,753 --> 00:07:11,813
To make him a human weapon,

39
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:17,291
Fakhtooni raised him with black magic,
sorcery and severe training.

40
00:07:21,932 --> 00:07:28,269
The marme of this 25 year developed
human weapon is Rakha.

41
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:11,200
Swamy!

42
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,073
I've brought the Jwalamukhi diamond.

43
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:21,880
I'll visit 8 seats of divine power and
reach Haridwar for the great Kumbhmela.

44
00:09:22,052 --> 00:09:25,385
You come to Haridwar with
this Jwalamukhi diamond.

45
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:29,048
Cleanse it with the holy water of river Ganges,

46
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:35,688
and then tell your daughter
all the secrets.

47
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:11,424
Hail Goddess Mother!

48
00:10:20,577 --> 00:10:25,207
Protect Aishwarya and
Jwalamukhi diamond safely.

49
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:26,610
As you say, Swamy.

50
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,124
Did you see brother Jaffer?

51
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:45,133
My son is getting ready to go
to lndia in few days.

52
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:51,764
Now all we need is Rudra Trident
and the Jwalamukhi diamond.

53
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,635
The diamond is now with Mahadevaraya.

54
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:59,111
It's impossible to take it from him.
- Why?

55
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,683
Mahadevaraya is a Central Minister of India.

56
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:02,986
Then how?

57
00:11:03,153 --> 00:11:04,484
There's only one way.

58
00:11:04,655 --> 00:11:08,352
Mahadevaraya has a 22 year old
daughter who is his life,

59
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:12,325
to achieve what we want, she must also be in
our custody along with the diamond.

60
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:16,023
Let's inform our people in Hyderabad
and get her kidnapped.

61
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,565
What's her name?

62
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:51,257
Junior madam !

63
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,103
What are you doing here?

64
00:11:59,276 --> 00:12:01,301
You see us since your childhood,
why are you asking it again?

65
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:05,639
We are doing our duty,
I'm always perfect in my duty.

66
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,014
Bloody! Security here too?

67
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:12,121
Whether it's 5-star chocolate you eat
or 5-star hotel you stay.

68
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,303
Is it? Which hotel?

69
00:13:02,473 --> 00:13:04,600
Sir, Home Minister's daughter!

70
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,477
Why is this gang trying to kidnap
Home Minister's daughter?

71
00:13:09,813 --> 00:13:11,144
Hi dad.
- Hi dear.

72
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:13,143
It seems you're going abroad.

73
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:16,779
I'm also planning to go to
Araku Valley with my friends.

74
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:19,783
We're leaving tomorrow morning.
- No, you're not.

75
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:22,815
She'll not leave home for next two months.

76
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,625
I'll go dad.
- No way,

77
00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:28,822
after the recent incident
in the swimming pool,

78
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,828
IG uncle has told me specifically
that your life is in danger,

79
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:33,659
and not to let her move out of home.

80
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:38,698
She'll be in home only, double the security.

81
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:40,343
Secure her properly.

82
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:43,302
I'm getting late to my flight, bye.

83
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:49,479
Always there's security man
around me like l'm in a jail.

84
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:51,883
From my childhood, not a minute
of freedom to live on my own.

85
00:13:52,222 --> 00:13:53,519
Your life is better.

86
00:14:00,497 --> 00:14:02,590
Our Araku trip is planned,
and our gang is ready to leave.

87
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:05,792
We're not going to Araku.
Dad said no.

88
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:06,932
Why?

89
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:09,865
We're going on the trip secretly.

90
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,910
Exactly after an hour be ready
near my house compound wall.

91
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:17,873
We're leaving silently.
- Okay, we'll be there right now.

92
00:14:48,812 --> 00:14:53,943
We must protect madam like our eyes,
additional men are joining duty tomorrow.

93
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:58,914
I mean double security.
I must hear even if an ant is crushed.

94
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:03,250
From that wall to this wall,
from this wall to that wall,

95
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:06,362
whatever may happen, it must be
brought to my notice immediately.

96
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:14,437
Parrot must feel happy about
security of Doberman like me.

97
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:16,334
Minister must be astonished.

98
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:18,770
Onlookers must go crazy.

99
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:20,740
You planned it?

100
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:25,942
I'll close my eyes and put my finger on
the map, we're going wherever I touch.

101
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,778
Take your finger...Jaipur!

102
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:39,924
We're free from restrictions,
security and that Subba Rao.

103
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:43,256
Welcome....welcome...

104
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,025
Okay.
- Welcome to Jaipur!

105
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:46,461
Welcome to Jaipur!

106
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:48,764
Welcome to Jaipur!

107
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:53,436
Can't you ask that in Telugu?
Problem?

108
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:56,437
You've come with so many girls,
there are many rogues here,

109
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:59,639
you'll be in trouble.
I know Hindi.

110
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,676
Make arrangements for the trip.

111
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:02,944
You move aside, I'll talk to her.

112
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:05,847
Greetings madam, our's is A to Z

00:16:10,027 --> 00:16:11,051
We'll take you in this van.

115
00:16:12,796 --> 00:16:13,854
God!

116
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:19,061
Your name?

117
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:27,332
I'm bored going in Mercedes and BMW's,
let's travel in this van.

118
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:29,479
It's be variety.
- Come.

119
00:16:32,582 --> 00:16:33,742
It's releasing today.

120
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:36,010
I must see first day first show.
- You must see!

121
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:42,890
Junior madam is sleeping, madam.
Would've watched TV all the night.

122
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:46,723
Get up!

123
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,697
Mother, I'm going on a trip with my friends,

124
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:54,837
Subba, you can't catch me,

125
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,731
What have you done, junior madam?

126
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:01,811
Parrot has flown!

127
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:13,981
Just see the posters and
decorations for now,

128
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,485
let's try for matinee show.

129
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,989
I must watch Sallu's film first day first show.

130
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,991
Tommy, try in black. No end for it.

131
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,424
I'll try.

132
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:27,365
It seems the heroine's role
is shattering in the film.

133
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:03,905
Who is he looking like 'Adavi Ramudu'?

134
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:08,600
Grand entry on elephant is shattering.

135
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,088
His speed reminds like Andhrawala.

136
00:18:19,423 --> 00:18:22,915
Wherever he may be he's their own,
he belongs to everyone,

137
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:43,811
he's a big Salman Khan fan, but he
himself has many fans, including me.

138
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,244
Though he's dirty, he's dynamic.

139
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,646
Off late he's rocking girls.

140
00:19:04,568 --> 00:19:06,229
Rs.100 ticket for Rs.500.
- Give me 6 tickets.

141
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,559
Go away.

142
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:11,571
Rs.100 ticket for Rs.500.
Did you give him the tickets?

143
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:14,539
Rs.100 ticket for Rs.500
....come...come...

144
00:19:14,711 --> 00:19:16,770
Hey, he seems to be carrying lot of money.

145
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:20,678
Hey you!
- What?

146
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:23,081
My ticket, it's in my hands now.
I paid you, right?

147
00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:24,447
If you want to watch the film,
shell out money?

148
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:25,944
I gave you.

149
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:27,247
You seem to have lot of money.

150
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:29,024
If I do, should I've to give?
- Take out money.

151
00:19:30,694 --> 00:19:35,131
You've lot of money, if you want to
watch the film, shell out money again.

152
00:19:37,701 --> 00:19:38,895
Who are you?

153
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:44,702
God is up there, the film's hero is Salman,

154
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,275
and the man before you is Shakthiman.

155
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:49,977
Hey fool! What's your problem?

156
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:52,738
There are many problems,

157
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,749
the country where Ganges flows,
there's no water,

158
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,285
the theatre where the film is on show,
there no tickets.

159
00:19:59,723 --> 00:20:02,886
if the tickets are available in black market,
no money to buy them,

160
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,619
agreed if ticket is bought in black market.

161
00:20:05,795 --> 00:20:11,131
and after that to fight with rogues,
wastrels, and rascals like you,

162
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:13,269
and to save justice from unjust
and protect good from evil,

163
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:15,833
God has chosen only one man,

164
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,167
it means...me!

165
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,770
Claps!

166
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:21,303
Dialogue delivery was great!

167
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,027
The bell has rung!

168
00:20:58,214 --> 00:20:59,841
Bell has rung again!

169
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:02,951
Let's finish it quickly boys,
I must watch the film.

170
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:42,951
You're a one man army against
any number of people,

171
00:22:43,186 --> 00:22:45,279
you'r our saviour man of the era,

172
00:22:45,422 --> 00:22:47,390
you'r forest Ramma and driyver Rama...

173
00:22:48,258 --> 00:22:48,917
Shell out money?

174
00:22:49,092 --> 00:22:49,786
What?
- Money?

175
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,426
Stop praising me and
take out the money.

176
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:54,127
Money in hands, I'm like this always.

177
00:22:54,297 --> 00:22:55,389
Is it?

178
00:22:55,732 --> 00:22:57,791
I paid them Rs.3000 for six tickets
at Rs.500 each.

179
00:22:57,967 --> 00:23:00,367
Mine is not for the tickets but for the fight.

180
00:23:00,704 --> 00:23:03,138
Rs.1000 per head, take out Rs.10000.

181
00:23:03,306 --> 00:23:04,830
Did we ask you to fight them?

182
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,135
Low class guys are like that only,
they hit at our weak points.

183
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,505
I beat them to save your man.

184
00:23:11,314 --> 00:23:13,111
Want or don't want?

185
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:16,846
Let's go.
- Pay him.

186
00:23:17,954 --> 00:23:20,354
Take it, we don't take anybody's help.

187
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,180
Stop ragging and take out money.

188
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:24,986
Come on clap...

189
00:24:26,456 --> 00:24:30,449
Here I am...

190
00:24:43,306 --> 00:24:48,801
Wherever I'm it's festival, boisterous fun
and earth will shatter...

191
00:24:48,978 --> 00:24:54,314
Pride is my property, I'm all powerful
and don't take chances with me...

192
00:24:54,484 --> 00:24:59,945
I'm ready for any challenge,
if you've guts try to catch me...

193
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:06,221
I'm a bullet with speed like a rocket,
nobody can follow me...

194
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:50,431
I don't care if anyone says
I'm from low class...

195
00:25:50,607 --> 00:25:55,840
I'm a favourite with front benchers
and my heart is of high class...

196
00:25:56,012 --> 00:26:01,575
I may appear like a kid
but I'll attack like a lion...

197
00:26:01,818 --> 00:26:07,222
I swear on mother...

198
00:26:07,323 --> 00:26:09,723
I'll hack anyone who dares
stop me on my way...

199
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,494
I was born as a boon
from Goddess Durga...

200
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:15,324
I grew up in the protection of Lord Rama...

201
00:26:15,498 --> 00:26:18,160
I must become one in the world...

202
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:21,030
Future must look up to me as
a role model...

203
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,570
If you think you can
achieve anything, brother...

204
00:26:23,907 --> 00:26:27,070
Where there is a will,
there's a way, brother...

205
00:27:34,377 --> 00:27:40,077
If I concentrate all my energy and hit,
it'll rock and shatter anything...

206
00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:45,380
If I go after anything,
the world will be mine...

207
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:51,221
If I challenge with the power of my youth,
battlefields will shudder...

208
00:27:51,394 --> 00:27:53,157
No man...

209
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:59,361
No man worth his moustache has
ever dared to take on me and win...

210
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:04,996
My life is progressing towards top
signing off every step of success...

211
00:28:05,174 --> 00:28:07,665
Guts and courage are my support...

212
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:10,571
Self belief is my character...

213
00:28:10,747 --> 00:28:16,811
I'm my own boss,
I'm the boss, follow me...

214
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,178
Prachanda, call him.

215
00:28:50,386 --> 00:28:54,618
Jackie, Mahadevaraya is here without
security as you'd asked him to come.

216
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,658
When are we meeting?

217
00:28:59,295 --> 00:29:01,525
I'll inform the place later.
- You said we're meeting today, right?

218
00:29:01,998 --> 00:29:04,592
What you direcly need is with me,

219
00:29:07,103 --> 00:29:08,263
everything will be mine.

220
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:10,762
He says he'll meet day after tomorrow.

221
00:29:11,741 --> 00:29:12,537
What's this?

222
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:16,576
He's not Janaki Verma who once used
to work in your palace,

223
00:29:16,746 --> 00:29:20,876
He's now Jackie who has made billions
with underworld dealings.

224
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,318
He owns half of these buildings.

225
00:29:23,486 --> 00:29:25,886
The need is ours.

226
00:29:31,094 --> 00:29:35,463
Hubby, Aishwarya has escaped from
home and went on a trip with friends.

227
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:37,892
When?
- The night you left.

228
00:29:39,435 --> 00:29:43,303
You don't worry, but please keep
this matter secret.

229
00:29:43,473 --> 00:29:45,600
I'll talk to DIG.

230
00:29:51,514 --> 00:29:54,915
Home Minister's daughter gone
a secret trip with friends,

231
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,908
trace her.

232
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,453
Her photo and other details are in this cover.

233
00:30:00,623 --> 00:30:03,683
We've come to know she's in Jaipur,
inquire confidentially.

234
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,694
The girl belongs to a wealthy family,
keep it secret.

235
00:30:07,864 --> 00:30:08,922
That's what you want, sir?

236
00:30:21,544 --> 00:30:24,809
Sister, the eclipse is just 40 days away.

237
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:28,183
We must get that Jwalamukhi diamond
at any cost.

238
00:30:28,351 --> 00:30:31,320
Our men haven't yet been able to
kidnap Mahadevaraya's daughter.

239
00:30:31,521 --> 00:30:34,649
My younger son will take care of it.

240
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:39,357
Look there!

241
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:41,156
This is Mehrangarh fort.

242
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:44,231
If it's mount a fort, is it your home?
Tell the history correctly.

243
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,662
I can tell your history perfectly,

244
00:30:45,835 --> 00:30:50,363
To know the history, geography and
other details, our guide must come.

245
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,667
Who is he?
- Brother!

246
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:04,651
Guide?
- Did you mistake him for book? lt's him !

247
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,787
Is he a guide?

248
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:08,154
I'm a tour guide for living,

249
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,484
I'll make as much money
as possible from side.

250
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,650
I know you make money from side business.

251
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:14,625
Tell me the history of this fort.
First know his charges.

252
00:31:14,797 --> 00:31:18,824
King's fort and Queen's garden,
total tour Rs.2000.

253
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,831
Those who brood about cost
don't have any taste.

254
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,333
I'll go that children's group.
- Wait a minute brother.

255
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:29,968
Madam, please think over it again.
- I must give him a shock.

256
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,343
Okay, he must explain everything
which we can understand.- Okay.

257
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:37,509
Rates change with languages.
- Let's use Telugu.

258
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,847
He chose the most expensive.

259
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,513
Which type of Telugu you want?
Are there different types of Telugu?

260
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:45,684
There are many!
You want Nellore slang or Godavari slang,

261
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:48,523
you want Rayalaseema mass or Krishna class,

262
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,360
you want Guntur slang or Warangal slang,

263
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,695
you want East Godavari slang or Nizam slang.

264
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:58,200
Your man is no ordinary,
he's a master of all arts.

265
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:03,903
He's a very talkative man, if you delay,
he'll be picked up foreign tourists.

266
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:06,738
He has great demand.
- You start!

267
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:12,751
King watches from up there!
Queen dances down there!

268
00:32:15,424 --> 00:32:17,289
What do the soldiers do?
- Eat and sleep.

269
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,623
Your man knows many tricks.

270
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:25,263
Cannon.

271
00:32:25,468 --> 00:32:29,871
It was made in 1863.
King brought it in 1904.

272
00:32:30,273 --> 00:32:32,434
There are 150 cannons here.
- What's that place?

273
00:32:32,608 --> 00:32:35,270
What did we agree for?
- For this fort.

274
00:32:35,444 --> 00:32:37,605
Ask about this fort only,
it'll cost extra if you ask about that.

275
00:32:38,648 --> 00:32:39,444
Will this work?

276
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:41,276
Is yours working?
- What?

277
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,542
Your brain, take photo.

278
00:32:42,718 --> 00:32:45,949
You gave us a good tour with
your sweet talk, I'll pay you.

279
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:48,613
What?
- You needn't have to pay him .

280
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:52,292
He must pay us Rs.8000.
- Me? What?

281
00:32:52,628 --> 00:32:56,462
I'll tell if you want to hear it.
You took Rs.10000 in the theatre,

282
00:32:56,632 --> 00:33:00,466
if we cut Rs.2000 from it,
you still owe us Rs.8000.

283
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,537
That's a tip.

284
00:33:10,713 --> 00:33:14,479
We've side tracked your man, it's good
join us or we'll side track you also.

285
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,708
Here's your guide's hat.

286
00:33:21,057 --> 00:33:22,684
You've cheated him nicely.

287
00:33:33,002 --> 00:33:37,336
There's nothing here other than sand,
it's hot all over the place.

288
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,903
Stop here, need to drink something cool.

289
00:33:50,353 --> 00:33:52,685
We're not here to drink this.
- Then?

290
00:33:52,855 --> 00:33:55,517
To have hot tea.
- Hot tea?

291
00:33:55,691 --> 00:33:57,022
Tea in this hot sun!

292
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,698
No stove here,
where is he taking the kettle?

293
00:34:13,008 --> 00:34:15,340
Hot tea in hot desert!

294
00:34:30,393 --> 00:34:32,827
Won't he stop following us?

295
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:42,532
His way...I think it's the desert.

296
00:34:48,844 --> 00:34:49,742
One tea please.

297
00:34:51,814 --> 00:34:53,042
We must be very careful with him.

298
00:34:54,817 --> 00:34:57,047
He's stranger than you,
he's having tea in hot sun.

299
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,547
Money!
- Take from her.

300
00:34:59,855 --> 00:35:01,550
Why should I pay?

301
00:35:01,757 --> 00:35:04,590
Rs.2000 you cheated me yesterday,
not only this tea

302
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,993
But pay for the cart,
tent, my bed and fodder for the camel.

303
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:13,761
I forgot to tell you, you made
fun of me yesterday, I'm hurt.

304
00:35:13,936 --> 00:35:15,426
Rs.1000 extra for it.

305
00:35:16,172 --> 00:35:20,438
I think he's here for revenge.
- Revenge is mine not his.

306
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,941
I think he's not satisfied with
what I gave him.

307
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:25,943
I'll get him thrashed.

308
00:35:28,951 --> 00:35:29,975
You've a job!

309
00:35:30,152 --> 00:35:32,780
Powerfully! You've to beat...
thrash someone.

310
00:35:32,955 --> 00:35:34,946
I'll pay you for it. A lot of money.

311
00:35:35,124 --> 00:35:37,615
We'll do it.
- Leave me.

312
00:35:37,827 --> 00:35:42,025
You must beat him .
- Please save her.

313
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:46,798
She asked them to beat and
do something, they're on the job.

314
00:35:48,804 --> 00:35:50,032
Please take money and save her.

315
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:54,472
I'm a cheat, how dare you cheat me
Rs.2000 and then make fun of me also?

316
00:35:54,643 --> 00:35:55,166
I'll not come.

317
00:35:55,644 --> 00:35:56,133
Leave my hand.

318
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:59,812
I'll pay you for saving her
and the old due too.

319
00:36:02,585 --> 00:36:03,449
Leave me.

320
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,734
What happened, brother?

321
00:36:19,902 --> 00:36:23,463
The girl would've been raped by now.
Just miss!

322
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,937
Tomorrow means rape?
How is the girl now?

323
00:36:26,108 --> 00:36:28,872
If he hadn't come on time,
she would be gone.

324
00:36:29,144 --> 00:36:32,807
I got it, they would've squeezed
out life from her.

325
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:36,816
If this continues, my bag will go empty
and his box will get filled.

326
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,613
Not a box but ATM.

327
00:36:38,787 --> 00:36:42,154
People go to ATM for money,
but my ATM always travels with me.

328
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,755
Money only comes in, never goes out.

329
00:36:45,127 --> 00:36:47,960
I want your man.
- Are you that type?

330
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:51,627
I'm worried about girls and their safety.

331
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,496
If your man comes with us for
the entire tour, we'll be safe.

332
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,638
Please tell him.
- That's okay.but will cost you more.

333
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,997
Let it cost anything.
- Get approval from your madam.

334
00:36:59,174 --> 00:37:01,005
By then I'll convince him.
- Okay.

335
00:37:08,717 --> 00:37:11,550
Please try to understand why I'm
insisting him to join us.

336
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:18,553
Okay, but she...
- I'll pay but he mustn't refuse to do anything.

337
00:37:18,928 --> 00:37:21,055
Call him .
- Go.

338
00:37:22,898 --> 00:37:23,887
I'll take you to task.

339
00:37:24,066 --> 00:37:25,090
Your man has been fixed.

340
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:27,665
Shall we go?

341
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:29,563
It means?

342
00:37:30,005 --> 00:37:33,065
One night in the desert.
Arrange with him .

343
00:37:34,577 --> 00:37:35,271
Sir...

344
00:37:37,279 --> 00:37:38,769
What's this so long?

345
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:42,016
Must walk for an hour.

346
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,251
I think he's damn tired.

347
00:37:53,362 --> 00:37:56,593
We can pitch a tent anywhere
in the desert, right?

348
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:58,926
Why did he then made us walk for
a kilometre and pitched tents here?

349
00:37:59,101 --> 00:38:00,090
Anything special here?

350
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:02,999
To offer morning prayers earIy
in the morning.

351
00:38:04,974 --> 00:38:07,101
Be careful! Don't waste water.

352
00:38:08,143 --> 00:38:10,611
You've to walk a mile for a glass of water.

353
00:38:10,779 --> 00:38:12,679
You'll get burnt in the hot sun.

354
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,142
I'm going to sleep.

355
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:19,284
You need a companion.
- No need.

356
00:38:20,122 --> 00:38:23,956
I want two buckets of cold water
by tomorrow morning for my bath.

357
00:38:25,294 --> 00:38:29,788
It's difficult to get water to drink here,
how can he arrange two buckets for bath?

358
00:38:29,965 --> 00:38:33,128
That's his problem
tell him to accept he can't,

359
00:38:33,302 --> 00:38:34,030
Let's leave him.

360
00:38:34,203 --> 00:38:38,299
There's nothing impossible to him,
there's nothing he can't do.

361
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:40,199
But it'll cost you more.

362
00:38:40,376 --> 00:38:43,971
A bucket of water will...
- Rs.500?

363
00:38:44,146 --> 00:38:44,976
Rs.5000!

364
00:38:45,714 --> 00:38:48,148
What? Rs.5000 for a bucket full of water?

365
00:38:48,317 --> 00:38:52,219
This is broad dayhight robbery.
Use perfume, that's cheaper.

366
00:38:53,155 --> 00:38:54,144
Pay him.

367
00:38:54,823 --> 00:38:57,383
Let me see how he'll arrange water
by tomorrow morning.

368
00:38:58,327 --> 00:39:01,888
Earlier tickets now buckets,
he's making money!

369
00:39:02,064 --> 00:39:04,123
Look, if he says like that I'll feel hurt.

370
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:04,958
No need sir.

371
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,125
If you get hurt, we'll lose money.

372
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,757
He brought it!

373
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:38,163
This man will do anything for money.

374
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:42,429
Poor man! He would've walked all the
night to get two buckets of water.

375
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,100
Though he took Rs.10000,
he did a great job.

376
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,842
What happened?
What happened?

377
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,855
You...you...

378
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,029
I'll kill you.

379
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,797
I think they're hurt.

380
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,698
Will you charge us Rs.10000 for
getting water from here?

381
00:40:19,174 --> 00:40:20,368
What's there to cheat you?

382
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:23,375
It's your innocence not to know
there's a oasis near by.

383
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,373
It's my intelligence not to
tell you though I knew it.

384
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:29,150
Now that you now, why just take bath?
Jump in and swim too!

385
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,346
He'll completely rob us our money.

386
00:40:33,388 --> 00:40:34,719
I don't like this place.

387
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:36,858
Get the bags.

388
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,523
I think you're hurt.
- Very much.

389
00:40:41,864 --> 00:40:44,731
Pay Rs.1000!
- Should we pay you if we are hurt?

390
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,368
Hurt will cost Rs.1000, whether it's you
or me doesn't matter, pay.

391
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,167
Don't scold me, it'll double.

392
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,734
He's different.

393
00:41:05,788 --> 00:41:06,846
I got married just 3 days ago,

394
00:41:07,022 --> 00:41:08,853
I must be on a honeymoon with my wife,

395
00:41:09,024 --> 00:41:11,458
you've brought me to Jaipur
as if this is Madhapur.

396
00:41:11,794 --> 00:41:13,159
Tell me sir, why are we here?

397
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:17,123
30 years in department,
can't leak out top secret.

398
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:18,960
Can't you at least tell me sir?

399
00:41:19,334 --> 00:41:20,801
I'm very sincere in my duty.

400
00:41:20,969 --> 00:41:24,803
I divorced my wife,
I know when to leak and how.

401
00:41:24,973 --> 00:41:27,134
I want to know what that top secret...
- Will you shut your mouth?

402
00:41:27,309 --> 00:41:28,139
Okay.

403
00:41:32,981 --> 00:41:34,505
That's Pakistan, keep little this side.

404
00:42:18,493 --> 00:42:19,289
What's this?

405
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,001
Give me the Rudra Trident.

406
00:42:41,516 --> 00:42:43,006
You know why he's here...

407
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,348
He's here for the Rudra Trident.

408
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,956
I'm not Karna to give in charity
whatever the seeker asks.

409
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,526
I'm a businessman.

410
00:42:56,265 --> 00:42:57,197
What do you want?

411
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:02,030
My property, my jewels, diamonds and
gems I got from my ancestors,

412
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,330
I'll give you everything,

413
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,904
please return the Rudra Trident to me.

414
00:43:06,341 --> 00:43:10,175
I know it's value to you.

415
00:43:11,013 --> 00:43:16,076
I don't think your offer isn't the
right deal for the Trident.

416
00:43:17,953 --> 00:43:21,582
For all the injustice and
betrayals you did to me,

417
00:43:21,924 --> 00:43:25,189
I'm humbly begging you
with folded hands,

418
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:29,592
Infact making a servent please,
please give me the Rudra Trident.

419
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:33,258
lf you want take my life for it.

420
00:43:34,703 --> 00:43:40,608
Life is the only thing that is worthless.
No use in taking it.

421
00:43:41,109 --> 00:43:44,601
Already my accounts of sin
has too many lives.

422
00:43:53,322 --> 00:43:54,949
I'll think and tell you.

423
00:43:56,558 --> 00:44:01,257
I've many offers, I'll think and decide.

424
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,626
What's this?

425
00:44:20,482 --> 00:44:22,712
What's this rickety old bus?

426
00:44:22,985 --> 00:44:24,475
Change it right now.
- Okay.

427
00:44:24,653 --> 00:44:26,644
Did you hear it? Change the bus.

428
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:29,480
This is the only Telugu hotel in Srinagar.

429
00:44:29,658 --> 00:44:34,391
Owner will look like Charlie Chaplin,
he'll overact, that's him.

430
00:44:34,563 --> 00:44:37,862
Welcome to Kashmir Andhra Vilas!

431
00:44:38,533 --> 00:44:39,192
Do you know Telugu?

432
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:40,392
Yes.
- What's your name?

433
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:46,563
Hey you! Tell me your real name!

434
00:44:46,742 --> 00:44:50,735
My name is Sathibabu,
back home people call me as Sathi.

435
00:44:51,013 --> 00:44:53,345
Stop shivering first.
How come you're settled here?

436
00:44:53,515 --> 00:44:56,416
Mine is a best and worst love story,
please come.

437
00:44:56,585 --> 00:44:57,711
You're right.

438
00:44:59,354 --> 00:45:00,719
I came here as a lorry cleaner,

439
00:45:01,023 --> 00:45:02,752
came to know this hotel owner
has only daughter,

440
00:45:02,924 --> 00:45:05,256
I fell in love with her and
she too reciprocated,

441
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,988
and his father died hearing this,

442
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:09,756
I married her and conducted her
father's funeral at a time,

443
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,295
and became owner of this hotel.

444
00:45:11,767 --> 00:45:12,426
Sir.

445
00:45:12,634 --> 00:45:14,499
He's not Sathibabu but a big bore.

446
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,494
She too calls me like that only.
- Shut up.

447
00:45:17,672 --> 00:45:20,163
He trapped the girl and robe
the property in the name of love.

448
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,004
Love is not just blind but also short.
He's an example.

449
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,776
Arranged cottages for all of you,
please come.

450
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,777
People with children sleep
in the cottages,

451
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,005
people without children play out here.

452
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,675
Don't you've children to play with?
- We're working on that.

453
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,352
We're leaving.
- Is it?

454
00:45:35,624 --> 00:45:39,185
Thayaru, be ready,
I'm coming immediately.

455
00:45:40,462 --> 00:45:41,360
Tell me Sanyasi Rao.

456
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,021
Got information that they've left to Srinagar.

457
00:45:44,499 --> 00:45:46,023
You too go to Srinagar.
- Okay sir.

458
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,362
Trace them quickly.
- Hold on the line for a second.

459
00:45:49,337 --> 00:45:52,465
Aren't we going back to Hyderabad, sir?
- We're going to Kashmir.

460
00:45:57,179 --> 00:46:00,706
No use in offering prayers here
coming from Egypt.

461
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:03,483
Came to know the girl has gone
to Srinagar from Jaipur.

462
00:46:04,086 --> 00:46:07,249
This information is enough for
the Rs.1 crore you paid.

463
00:46:08,256 --> 00:46:12,249
We'll know further details later,
if you want to know more details,

464
00:46:12,627 --> 00:46:15,755
I want Rs.2 crores.
Why are you surprised?

465
00:46:16,431 --> 00:46:18,831
Is the girl's father a school headmaster?

466
00:46:20,769 --> 00:46:23,101
Pay money, don't stare at me.

467
00:46:38,787 --> 00:46:43,486
No man who knows about us mustn't live.

468
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:45,683
Let's go to Srinagar and search for her.

469
00:46:55,303 --> 00:46:57,294
He would be sleeping after a heavy meal,

470
00:46:57,472 --> 00:47:02,341
Let's open his ATM and take back
all the money he took from us.

471
00:47:02,511 --> 00:47:04,775
Not only our money,
let's steal his money also.

472
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,448
Slowly...

473
00:47:12,754 --> 00:47:14,221
He didn't even lock it.

474
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,454
Open it!

475
00:47:35,944 --> 00:47:37,912
Backs would've got burnt!

476
00:47:38,813 --> 00:47:40,280
Are your fuses broken?

477
00:47:40,448 --> 00:47:43,417
I think he touched it first, he's dazed.

478
00:47:46,588 --> 00:47:50,490
It's ATM, right?
I use current for night safety.

479
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:56,495
Next time I'll use high voltage,
if you touch you'll get burnt.

480
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,963
They've had an experience,
they'll not dare touch again.

481
00:47:59,301 --> 00:48:02,395
It's cold, right? Let's go now.

482
00:48:03,138 --> 00:48:03,695
What sir?

483
00:48:03,872 --> 00:48:07,706
Who will pay fine of Rs.10000
for opening my ATM? Your dad?

484
00:48:07,876 --> 00:48:10,743
We got electrocuted, right?
- That's punishment.

485
00:48:10,979 --> 00:48:12,469
Cash is penalty.

486
00:48:12,647 --> 00:48:16,310
Pay Rs.1000 extra for battery charging. Got it?

487
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:19,209
Pay him.
- Okay.

488
00:48:19,387 --> 00:48:19,876
Come.

489
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:23,924
It's inside, I'll get it.

490
00:48:26,761 --> 00:48:29,821
He's always overacts,
that's had a greater shock.

491
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:41,903
It's cool Kashmir, but my bad he's
with me instead of you.

492
00:48:42,077 --> 00:48:43,908
He'll die in that cold, bloody fool.

493
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:46,410
Did you see this girl?
- No.

494
00:48:46,581 --> 00:48:47,240
No?

495
00:48:47,415 --> 00:48:49,747
I promised to name out child after him also.

496
00:48:49,918 --> 00:48:51,579
How nasty it would be calling him Sanyasi?

497
00:48:51,686 --> 00:48:54,211
But he doesn't care. What to do?
- Are you Telugu?

498
00:48:54,422 --> 00:48:55,582
I'll call you later.
Are you Telugu people?

499
00:48:56,925 --> 00:48:58,449
Are you here for sightseeing?
- Yes.

500
00:48:58,627 --> 00:49:01,289
No, we're here to buy sites. Who are you?

501
00:49:01,763 --> 00:49:03,924
Don't feel for it, he's different.

502
00:49:04,165 --> 00:49:05,496
He speaks like that only.

503
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,927
What's that matter?
- We're on a trip.

504
00:49:08,637 --> 00:49:12,471
You're lucky sir, I'm married newly.
- Are you here on honeymoon?

505
00:49:12,841 --> 00:49:15,674
He literally dragged me from
the marriage.

506
00:49:19,447 --> 00:49:20,004
Take it.

507
00:49:22,617 --> 00:49:26,485
You got good thing in these bad times.
- Come and take photos.

508
00:49:28,857 --> 00:49:32,793
Not a girl looks docile to marry
the choice of parents.

509
00:49:32,961 --> 00:49:34,292
Everyone of them is eloping type.

510
00:49:34,462 --> 00:49:38,455
Bloody silly group, look at their faces,
their dresses and make up style,

511
00:49:38,633 --> 00:49:41,625
I told you they're useless group,
and leave me alone.

512
00:49:41,703 --> 00:49:43,000
Aishu, come here.

513
00:49:43,638 --> 00:49:44,798
And then that Tommy with them.

514
00:49:44,973 --> 00:49:48,465
Tommy? He looks like a street vendor.

515
00:49:49,544 --> 00:49:52,877
You wash your face with Zalim lotion.
- I don't use things used by others.

516
00:49:54,549 --> 00:49:56,483
Why are you so hot and angry
in this chill weather?

517
00:49:56,651 --> 00:49:59,848
I must give him a little shock.
- We must.

518
00:50:00,322 --> 00:50:02,051
Let's go to the snow,
- Come.

519
00:50:17,572 --> 00:50:20,006
How much ice here?

520
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:22,009
Won't you get down to show us around?

521
00:50:22,344 --> 00:50:23,834
There's nothing much to show
in snow mountains.

522
00:50:24,012 --> 00:50:26,071
lt's same everywhere, take photos.

523
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:30,680
Be careful, this is very dangerous place.

524
00:50:30,919 --> 00:50:32,682
Its snow cracks all over that place.

525
00:50:34,589 --> 00:50:37,683
Don't go beyond this pole,
there are many traps.

526
00:50:37,926 --> 00:50:39,018
Very dangerous.

527
00:50:39,527 --> 00:50:42,360
Why would we go after seeing this board?
Are we mad?

528
00:50:44,032 --> 00:50:46,023
Please don't do it.
- It seems it's very dangerous here.

529
00:50:46,368 --> 00:50:47,027
Let's go back.

530
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,029
What?

531
00:50:53,274 --> 00:50:56,038
I've a plan to trap Shakti.
- What's your plan?

532
00:50:57,612 --> 00:51:03,050
I'll hide there, you go anxiously
and tell him I'm missing.

533
00:51:03,785 --> 00:51:05,719
He'll come searching for me.

534
00:51:06,654 --> 00:51:09,350
He'll see my scarf there.

535
00:51:10,658 --> 00:51:14,788
He'll go to that spot.
He'll fall into the trap.

536
00:51:15,663 --> 00:51:16,687
Got it!
- You got it?

537
00:51:16,998 --> 00:51:21,697
He's robbing us like a dacoit,
we must steal it from him .

538
00:51:29,477 --> 00:51:31,377
No, please listen to me.

539
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:32,805
He'll come...

540
00:51:33,181 --> 00:51:34,045
He'll search...

541
00:51:34,916 --> 00:51:36,008
He'll slip...

542
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,382
He'll then roll down...

543
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,051
And falls into a trap...

544
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,553
Shakti, Ais is missing.
- Ice is all over the place.

545
00:51:50,598 --> 00:51:53,567
I'm telling you about Aishwarya.
I think she's stuck in ice.

546
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,704
I'm not joking, it's true.
Please save her.

547
00:51:59,674 --> 00:52:00,572
Look there!

548
00:52:13,121 --> 00:52:17,148
She said she'll hide for fun,
but she's missing really.

549
00:52:35,477 --> 00:52:38,640
Slowly...slowly...

550
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,051
Check her.

551
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:16,881
O beautiful baby, something has
happened to you...

552
00:53:17,886 --> 00:53:26,157
How do you feel now?

553
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:30,988
He said he's king...

554
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:36,000
He said it's unjust...

555
00:53:36,804 --> 00:53:41,173
He's man with sharp eyes...
He pinched me with eyes...

556
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,670
He's a magician...

557
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,676
He's hot like Sun...
He made me see stars...

558
00:53:55,857 --> 00:54:00,521
Come my sweet...
found her because of you...

559
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:05,064
It's sweet all the way...

560
00:54:05,233 --> 00:54:09,897
I'm free like air, I met you...

561
00:54:10,071 --> 00:54:15,236
Today I'm not myself anymore...

562
00:54:34,095 --> 00:54:39,123
Towards the way of Cupid...

563
00:54:43,605 --> 00:54:48,372
Oh I lost my sleep...

564
00:55:26,047 --> 00:55:34,216
Don't touch me, take everything
lock, stock and barrel...Play on it...

565
00:55:34,856 --> 00:55:43,560
I'll take on you and
fulfill all your desires...Hold on...

566
00:55:44,999 --> 00:55:53,668
Make me squeal with pain of pleasure...

567
00:55:54,842 --> 00:56:03,978
I'll have your sweet cheeks...
There will be no marks on it...

568
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:13,117
Let's unite our hearts, souls and bodies...
Is your youth voting for me?

569
00:57:01,542 --> 00:57:10,575
Take me to some place
on the flying horse...

570
00:57:10,985 --> 00:57:19,620
Can't I touch your
waist while riding it?

571
00:57:20,161 --> 00:57:29,934
Please do something without
getting any bad name...

572
00:57:30,338 --> 00:57:39,610
Oh dear, control your speed...
don't push me...

573
00:57:39,781 --> 00:57:44,150
I'm a rogue and a man of great power...

574
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:48,655
Would I say no to you...

575
00:58:18,085 --> 00:58:20,451
What happened?
- You know how we were worried.

576
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,551
With god's grace you got saved.

577
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:27,955
You said he's bad boy
but he saved your life.

578
00:58:34,268 --> 00:58:35,132
How nice it is!

579
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,134
This is one of the 8 temples of
Goddess Mother in Kashmir.

580
00:58:47,448 --> 00:58:49,143
Why are they tying it, Sathibabu?

581
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:52,912
This Goddess is very powerful,
a mother who fulfills our wishes,

582
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:56,988
when I was a bearer in their hotel
cleaning tables and glasses,

583
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:59,088
I wanted to love her and
then marry her,

584
00:58:59,293 --> 00:59:02,091
Made a vow and tied it here,
and my wish got fulfilled.

585
00:59:02,296 --> 00:59:03,957
I too tied without his knowledge.

586
00:59:40,902 --> 00:59:42,392
Are you making a vow?

587
00:59:44,906 --> 00:59:46,396
For whom?

588
00:59:48,109 --> 00:59:51,510
What did you wish from Goddess? For whom?
We must know the answer.

589
00:59:53,347 --> 00:59:58,250
Tell me...tell me...isn't it for Shakti?
- Isn't it for the guide?

590
00:59:58,419 --> 01:00:05,621
Tell me Aishu!
Tell me!

591
01:00:08,095 --> 01:00:10,586
Tell me...did you fall in snow or love?

592
01:00:11,098 --> 01:00:12,429
Stop...

593
01:00:16,537 --> 01:00:17,936
Found the girl.

594
01:00:20,274 --> 01:00:21,263
Tell me...

595
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:30,417
Who are you?

596
01:00:33,621 --> 01:00:34,610
Go quickly!

597
01:00:44,231 --> 01:00:47,462
Shakti, few people kidnapped Aishwarya.
- Where?

598
01:00:47,635 --> 01:00:50,297
They came in two cars and
kidnapped Aishwarya.

599
01:00:50,972 --> 01:00:51,961
You go quickly!

600
01:03:52,553 --> 01:03:55,852
Which side did he go?
- That side.

601
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:08,226
We missed the girl.

602
01:04:08,402 --> 01:04:12,600
Who saved the girl from us?

603
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:18,476
It's my habit to take photos with
guests and hang it in reception,

604
01:04:19,813 --> 01:04:22,646
Moreover I like you all,
please one photo with you sir.

605
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:29,812
What?

606
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:32,148
You'll go to that hotel and
inquire showing a photo,

607
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:33,918
why don't you tell me whose photo is that?

608
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:37,627
I will, shut up.

609
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,158
You want room ?
I want a girl.

610
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:44,270
You don't get here.
- Have you seen this girl?

611
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:49,499
Are you a Telugu man?
- Yes.

612
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,941
They were my guests for two days.
With you ?

613
01:04:52,313 --> 01:04:53,837
Where are they now?
- They went just now.

614
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,478
Where?
- They went that side.

615
01:04:55,649 --> 01:04:56,673
What do you mean by went this side?

616
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:59,182
They went in a white tempo
of A to Z travels.

617
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:01,184
If you go quickly, you can catch them.

618
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:03,846
But it's a valley, right after a left turn,
there's a mountain,

619
01:05:04,158 --> 01:05:05,216
go around the mountain...

620
01:05:06,994 --> 01:05:10,225
Who are you? Bloody fool!

621
01:05:10,731 --> 01:05:12,722
We're leaving.
- Thayaru, I'm coming.

622
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,390
Not to Hyderabad but chasing them.

623
01:05:14,568 --> 01:05:15,899
Come.
- Okay.

624
01:05:16,437 --> 01:05:18,234
Now says chase, changing every other minute.

625
01:05:18,405 --> 01:05:19,337
What do you want me to do?

626
01:05:19,506 --> 01:05:22,407
Aishu, keep your finger here.

627
01:05:22,576 --> 01:05:25,568
He always asks her to put finger.
Come on do it.

628
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,407
Not finger, I'll say with my heart.

629
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,578
Haridwar?

630
01:05:44,865 --> 01:05:46,264
Jackie is not responding to our phone calls.

631
01:05:46,433 --> 01:05:50,426
I feel Egyptians are also trying
severely for the Rudra Trident.

632
01:05:50,604 --> 01:05:52,435
I must go to Haridwar
and meet Swamy.

633
01:05:52,773 --> 01:05:54,934
I must cleanse the Jwalamukhi
in the holy river Ganges.

634
01:05:55,976 --> 01:05:57,705
Aishwarya hasn't yet been traced.

635
01:05:57,878 --> 01:06:02,042
I'll take care of Jackie,
you're getting late, go back to lndia.

636
01:06:05,819 --> 01:06:07,446
Isn't it adding beauty to
our reception area?- Yes.

637
01:06:07,621 --> 01:06:10,454
Isn't it very good?
Go and do your work.

638
01:06:23,804 --> 01:06:28,468
No vacancy here,
please find another hotel. Please go.

639
01:06:29,643 --> 01:06:30,974
Have you seen this girl?

640
01:06:40,387 --> 01:06:43,584
What's that snake tattoo on hand?
Why is it having wings?

641
01:06:43,824 --> 01:06:48,488
Bloody dirty face!
What's that lousy hairstyle?

642
01:06:48,996 --> 01:06:53,330
Go...go away! Go away!

643
01:07:16,457 --> 01:07:18,948
Sathibabu! Unable to live without us.

644
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:22,655
Where are you heading, Devudu?

645
01:07:27,368 --> 01:07:28,995
Line got cut.

646
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:42,679
No...no...

647
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:13,945
What?
- Where's the Jwalamukhi diamond?

648
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:20,750
May be Aishwarya took it along with money.

649
01:08:24,658 --> 01:08:27,786
Jwalamukhi must be cleansed in river Ganges.
What to do now?

650
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:12,435
Get down!

651
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:34,090
I'll get a priest to offer prayers.

652
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:36,789
No need to go, I'm here already.

653
01:09:41,034 --> 01:09:42,058
Where are you coming from?

654
01:09:42,236 --> 01:09:46,605
Please don't ask, they don't know where
they came from and where they are going.

655
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:50,800
Very strange group, and Tom my
is too much. Bloody overacts.

656
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:52,138
That's him.
Did he ask you?

657
01:09:52,613 --> 01:09:54,274
Told him just for information.

658
01:09:55,115 --> 01:09:56,139
I think you're also from our side.

659
01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:58,974
Yes, Vaishnavaite, my name is Narayana.

660
01:09:59,152 --> 01:10:03,646
Let's get to business,
you must first offer Rs.1116.

661
01:10:04,124 --> 01:10:06,490
How much can it hold?
- Let's see that after the prayers.

662
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,491
Another robber has joined the thief.

663
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:11,153
I think you both belong to the same caste.
- Yes.

664
01:10:11,965 --> 01:10:15,162
Change your clothes, let's start.
- Come.

665
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:31,814
What?

666
01:10:32,152 --> 01:10:39,684
Jaipur, Kashmir and now Haridwar,
I fear I may also end up as a mendicant.

667
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:44,524
I'll not let you become a mendicant or
unite with wife till I find the person I want.

668
01:10:44,965 --> 01:10:48,196
Where's Goddess Mother's temple here?
Where is it?

669
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:50,526
That's Goddess Manasa Devi's temple.

670
01:10:51,538 --> 01:10:58,706
Goddess Mother's eight...
It's not eight but eighteen.

671
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:04,511
How dare you teach me how many parts
to a Vedic scholar like me!

672
01:11:04,751 --> 01:11:05,581
Don't get angry sir.

673
01:11:05,752 --> 01:11:07,777
There are eighteen precincts of
Goddess Mother's temples.

674
01:11:07,955 --> 01:11:10,753
Along with Siddha precincts of power,
it's 108!

675
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:14,918
You're blabbering 18 and 108,
what the hell you know about it?

676
01:11:15,095 --> 01:11:18,087
Do you at least know one name of a precinct?

677
01:11:18,265 --> 01:11:21,098
Do you know where are they?
- Do you at least know it?

678
01:11:24,605 --> 01:11:26,766
Goddess Shankari Devi in Srilanka.

679
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:32,139
Visalakshi in Kanchi
somewhere near Chennai...

680
01:12:04,311 --> 01:12:08,145
18 temples of Goddess Mother!
The count is tallied.

681
01:12:09,716 --> 01:12:12,378
You're elder, I'm not so great
to teach you, sir.

682
01:12:13,053 --> 01:12:16,648
Please accept your limitations sir,
tell what you know very well.

683
01:12:20,661 --> 01:12:24,324
There's some power in him
there's an unknown power in him.

684
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:49,909
Jwalamukhi has been cleansed!

685
01:14:34,027 --> 01:14:36,154
She's here only!

686
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:40,496
Don't know where did he vanish?

687
01:14:41,034 --> 01:14:42,831
Did you see this girl?

688
01:14:45,138 --> 01:14:45,797
This girl!

689
01:14:45,972 --> 01:14:47,997
You inquired about her and
brought me to this place.

690
01:14:48,175 --> 01:14:50,143
I met her in Kashmir itself.

691
01:14:52,813 --> 01:14:55,304
I saw this girl.
- He's claiming it for money.

692
01:14:55,482 --> 01:14:56,972
You keep quiet.
- She's a Telugu girl, right?

693
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:59,311
Just now I offered prayers for her.
- Where?

694
01:14:59,486 --> 01:15:05,789
She's there only,
hey girl! Someone is searching for you!

695
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:06,789
That's the girl sir!

696
01:15:08,128 --> 01:15:10,392
Police!
- lt seems police!

697
01:15:18,104 --> 01:15:19,799
Why is it so crowded?
- More than a crore people are here.

698
01:15:20,106 --> 01:15:21,801
Let's leave the place immmediately.
Just now we...

699
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:21,064
A big mistake has happened!
I came here empty handed.

700
01:16:22,335 --> 01:16:27,329
Yes Swamy, Jwalamukhi is missing
from my house safe.

701
01:16:27,507 --> 01:16:31,102
I don't know how it got lost!
May be it's with Aishwarya.

702
01:16:32,112 --> 01:16:33,511
I don't know where is she now.

703
01:16:34,347 --> 01:16:38,579
I failed to get it cleansed in the
holy river Ganges. What to do now?

704
01:16:38,919 --> 01:16:40,580
Don't feel sad, Mahadevaraya.

705
01:16:42,188 --> 01:16:48,093
God has decided that our endeavour
must be accomplished.

706
01:16:50,096 --> 01:16:57,264
That's why on the decided day at the auspicious
time, Jwalamukhi got cleansed.

707
01:16:57,437 --> 01:16:58,267
What are you saying, Swamy?

708
01:16:58,438 --> 01:17:00,599
I'm sure Jwalamukhi is cleansed in Ganges.

709
01:17:01,942 --> 01:17:07,278
Not only that my soul tells me
the protector too has arrived.

710
01:17:07,948 --> 01:17:10,007
It's all the blessings of Goddess Mother.

711
01:17:10,183 --> 01:17:16,520
Jackie didn't give the Rudra Trident,
though I offered him all my wealth.

712
01:17:18,959 --> 01:17:20,119
We're police!

713
01:17:24,197 --> 01:17:25,528
Your daughter Aishwarya is here only sir.

714
01:17:25,699 --> 01:17:26,529
Really?
- Yes sir.

715
01:17:26,633 --> 01:17:28,498
Where?
- She ran away seeing us.

716
01:17:29,302 --> 01:17:37,368
Aishwarya is here, it means Jwalamukhi
has been cleansed as you said.

717
01:17:38,578 --> 01:17:40,671
Jwalamukhi must have been
with Aishwarya.

718
01:17:42,248 --> 01:17:43,545
Where is Aishwarya?

719
01:17:54,594 --> 01:17:56,357
I'll tell him today.

720
01:17:57,330 --> 01:17:58,524
Have you decided?

721
01:17:59,566 --> 01:18:02,399
Whatever it is, your man is very lucky.

722
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,164
I fell head over heals
in love with you...

723
01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:42,172
Hitting the heart, I'll create chaos...

724
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:46,676
Go boy! Did you get me so easily?

725
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:51,006
I was free like wind...
I got you now...

726
01:18:51,184 --> 01:19:00,024
Coming after me! My dream lover!
Handsome hero! Stop fighting!

727
01:19:54,514 --> 01:19:58,610
Young maiden! Golden beauty!

728
01:19:58,785 --> 01:20:04,155
I'm your man,
you're my love...

729
01:20:04,324 --> 01:20:08,454
Hey man! Do what you've been
asked to do...

730
01:20:08,628 --> 01:20:12,621
This is mistake, very great
and it's right...

731
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:17,133
Beauty with no waist...
bewitching damsel...

732
01:20:17,303 --> 01:20:22,798
Though there are many beauties,
my heart is after you only...

733
01:21:27,507 --> 01:21:36,347
You're an astonishing guy!
You're a great dam lier!

734
01:21:37,183 --> 01:21:45,352
You're a damsel! Giving and
taking between us is great romance...

735
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:49,689
He appeared and took away my heart...

736
01:21:49,862 --> 01:21:55,698
He swept my feet away from ground...

737
01:22:21,427 --> 01:22:22,257
What's this?

738
01:22:22,428 --> 01:22:23,861
He got so many letters like this.

739
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:26,260
He'll not care even it's written in blood.

740
01:22:37,443 --> 01:22:38,637
What?
- What happened?

741
01:22:38,811 --> 01:22:40,278
I think accident.
- Okay get down.

742
01:22:52,792 --> 01:22:55,454
Bhai, he's that boy!

743
01:22:56,296 --> 01:22:57,991
Bloody, the one who took on me.

744
01:23:38,838 --> 01:23:40,738
Okay, kill him!

745
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:41,649
Who is he?

746
01:25:41,828 --> 01:25:46,856
Secret agent of NSA Shakthiswaroop.

747
01:28:31,631 --> 01:28:35,123
Sister! Janaki Verma is coming
with Rudra Trident.

748
01:28:40,039 --> 01:28:42,132
He'll not back from Egypt.

749
01:28:52,985 --> 01:28:54,816
How do you do, Janaki Verma?

750
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:05,324
Don't forget you've come to this
position because of our help.

751
01:29:05,598 --> 01:29:11,059
27 years ago I gave you a secret
you wanted desperately.

752
01:29:12,905 --> 01:29:15,635
You paid for it as much as I wished.

753
01:29:17,309 --> 01:29:18,640
It was not alms.

754
01:29:21,647 --> 01:29:23,137
Where's the Rudra Trident?

755
01:29:28,988 --> 01:29:33,357
My only wish now is to become
the richest man in the world,

756
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:38,460
If you fulfill it,
I'll give this Trident to you,

757
01:29:39,031 --> 01:29:43,365
If not I'll give this to anyone
who fulfills my wish.

758
01:29:51,043 --> 01:29:57,972
I'm a snake myself, I've reached this position
betraying people who raised me,

759
01:29:58,184 --> 01:30:00,118
you can't scare me.

760
01:30:02,688 --> 01:30:03,780
Didn't you bring it?

761
01:30:04,990 --> 01:30:06,355
It's in Dubai only.

762
01:30:07,026 --> 01:30:11,360
I'm not a joker to bring it to
your place on your request.

763
01:30:11,664 --> 01:30:13,222
I'm Jackie!

764
01:30:13,799 --> 01:30:17,462
Come to my castle,
transfer money to my account,

765
01:30:17,803 --> 01:30:19,532
and take the Trident, Jaffer.

766
01:30:21,707 --> 01:30:25,700
Fakhtooni, the eclipse is not far away.

767
01:30:26,178 --> 01:30:28,669
The rate will shoot up as you delay.

768
01:30:28,881 --> 01:30:31,042
Your wish will remain unfulfilled.

769
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:38,222
Sister, we've to follow his orders,
no other choice.

770
01:30:59,044 --> 01:31:00,341
Sorry mom.

771
01:31:02,081 --> 01:31:03,173
Sorry dad.

772
01:31:06,285 --> 01:31:07,809
Where's the Jwalamukhi?

773
01:31:10,156 --> 01:31:11,088
Jwalamukhi?

774
01:31:11,257 --> 01:31:13,191
It was in the locker with money.

775
01:31:13,359 --> 01:31:17,159
You may have taken it by mistake,
please try to remember.

776
01:31:19,298 --> 01:31:21,493
Try to remember, it's a round box.

777
01:31:21,834 --> 01:31:24,098
With marks of sacred mono syllable
and Swastika.

778
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:25,498
What box?

779
01:31:27,173 --> 01:31:28,504
I don't know...
I don't remember anything, dad.

780
01:31:28,841 --> 01:31:34,302
Your daughter is safe from danger,
why are you upset instead of happy?

781
01:31:35,347 --> 01:31:36,939
That is more important than my daughter.

782
01:31:38,184 --> 01:31:40,482
Search everyone who went with Aishwarya.

783
01:32:08,147 --> 01:32:10,308
Who gave you the permission
for undercover operations?

784
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:14,278
While joining the duty in this department,

785
01:32:14,787 --> 01:32:18,587
we had taken a oath to sacrifice even
our lives to protect this country.

786
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:21,324
I did that to keep that oath.

787
01:32:21,894 --> 01:32:25,625
We attacked the terrorist group in the
hotel according to information we got,

788
01:32:26,232 --> 01:32:30,635
Thought I can know the reason why they were
targetting home Minister's daughter

789
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:34,462
so I went to the girl's home
to monitor security personally,

790
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:37,268
I saw her jumping the wall then, sir,

791
01:32:37,443 --> 01:32:41,436
I was sure they would follow the girl
who escaped from the house,

792
01:32:41,614 --> 01:32:45,983
I thought I could catch them and
followed her as a guide,

793
01:32:46,151 --> 01:32:47,448
result of my plan,

794
01:32:51,957 --> 01:32:55,188
I got the group's head Bashim .

795
01:32:57,529 --> 01:32:58,496
Did he tell anything?

796
01:32:58,664 --> 01:33:01,132
I'm sure he's responsible
for ACP Banerjee's murder.

797
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:03,461
But he's not talking.

798
01:33:04,303 --> 01:33:07,761
Leave him to me for an hour.

799
01:33:10,409 --> 01:33:12,104
Ravi will take care of it.

800
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:20,718
Bashim has been arrested by NSA.

801
01:33:22,922 --> 01:33:24,719
He's under tight security.

802
01:33:26,292 --> 01:33:28,590
Time is fast approaching,
what should we do now?

803
01:33:28,928 --> 01:33:34,127
My elder son Rakha is the answer
to all your questions.

804
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:36,427
Come let's go to India.

805
01:33:45,311 --> 01:33:48,246
Why are you so tired
for 10 minutes only?

806
01:33:48,314 --> 01:33:50,282
Have this to regain energy.

807
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:57,080
If Shakti comes, I'm confused
If I must dismiss or suspend him .

808
01:33:57,256 --> 01:34:00,089
I'm the Chief and
he brushes me aside cheaply.

809
01:34:00,259 --> 01:34:02,318
Who are you talking about?

810
01:34:02,494 --> 01:34:03,756
You're too much!

811
01:34:07,032 --> 01:34:08,363
Thanks dad!

812
01:34:08,567 --> 01:34:10,535
At last you've agreed I'm great!

813
01:34:10,703 --> 01:34:12,637
Did you see? He's having the drink
you brought for me, Barging!

814
01:34:12,972 --> 01:34:14,200
Why do you need this, dad?

815
01:34:14,373 --> 01:34:17,672
You look ugly with that pot belly,
reduce it.- Yes.

816
01:34:18,043 --> 01:34:19,977
He did IPS but has
criminal intelligence.

817
01:34:20,145 --> 01:34:22,670
You left for undercover operation
without informing me.

818
01:34:23,015 --> 01:34:25,245
Going without information
is known as undercover.

819
01:34:25,417 --> 01:34:28,215
Is it any function to inform
everyone and then go.

820
01:34:28,387 --> 01:34:30,082
As a chief, won't you inform me also?

821
01:34:30,255 --> 01:34:33,247
I know everything you did with Home Minister's
daughter in the name of undercover.

822
01:34:33,425 --> 01:34:34,756
I've the entire file.

823
01:34:36,328 --> 01:34:40,321
If you interfere in my personal matters...
- Okay son....cool down.

824
01:34:40,499 --> 01:34:44,560
Today is his birthday, instead of blessing
or wishing him, what's this?

825
01:34:44,737 --> 01:34:46,329
Am I new to this?

826
01:34:46,505 --> 01:34:50,066
His irritation is blessing to me,
his scoldings are wishes.

827
01:34:50,275 --> 01:34:52,743
Okay, get ready,
let's go to the temple.

828
01:35:02,621 --> 01:35:04,350
Very beautiful!

829
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:08,756
Madam, Home Minister's daughter!

830
01:35:09,094 --> 01:35:11,995
Our Shakthi and this girl...

831
01:35:12,164 --> 01:35:13,597
Greetings aunty.

832
01:35:13,766 --> 01:35:17,167
She's like an angel,
take good care of her, David.

833
01:35:17,336 --> 01:35:22,330
Just like you Shakti sir too felt and
looked after her very well for 20 days.

834
01:35:22,508 --> 01:35:25,636
She too took good care of Shakthi.

835
01:35:25,811 --> 01:35:27,210
I took care of both of them.

836
01:35:27,379 --> 01:35:30,348
Then, they know each other well.

837
01:35:30,516 --> 01:35:31,778
Nothing like that aunty.

838
01:35:32,117 --> 01:35:34,711
So, the matter is very clear
to you, right?

839
01:35:35,054 --> 01:35:35,816
You keep quiet.

840
01:35:36,155 --> 01:35:40,819
I came to see if I've missed
anything and left with Shakti.

841
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,718
I think there will be,
it's in the bedroom only.

842
01:35:43,062 --> 01:35:44,290
Marry him.

843
01:35:45,798 --> 01:35:48,130
She said go and see.

844
01:35:52,204 --> 01:35:54,195
She heard it differently.

845
01:36:38,150 --> 01:36:42,519
Princess of Kingdom of love...
young maiden...

846
01:36:42,688 --> 01:36:47,284
You've selected and chose
the gardener Ramu...

847
01:36:57,169 --> 01:37:01,606
Mischievous young man...
fell for you...

848
01:37:01,707 --> 01:37:06,235
You've charmed my heart
with your magic...

849
01:37:06,445 --> 01:37:11,007
You're my dream and my reality...

850
01:37:11,283 --> 01:37:16,778
My heart and soul is
enchanted by you...

851
01:38:05,804 --> 01:38:10,400
Come to me my dear and
let me hold your thin waist...

852
01:38:10,576 --> 01:38:15,673
O my dear, light the fire of
pleasure in me...

853
01:38:15,847 --> 01:38:18,008
Spread the bed of lightning...

854
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:19,977
Desires are overflowing...

855
01:38:20,319 --> 01:38:25,222
Let the passions of love get eased...

856
01:38:25,390 --> 01:38:29,520
Spread your magic and
win over my and my heart...

857
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:35,725
Come and take on me...

858
01:39:24,449 --> 01:39:28,977
How much your beauty and youth
would've waited for this day?

859
01:39:29,321 --> 01:39:34,020
How much the separation
from you had affected me?

860
01:39:34,359 --> 01:39:43,631
I thought my life is all yours...

861
01:39:43,869 --> 01:39:48,806
Me, my heart and my youth
is all yours...

862
01:40:49,101 --> 01:40:50,125
Why are you here?

863
01:40:50,969 --> 01:40:52,095
What are you doing here?

864
01:40:52,437 --> 01:40:55,429
I'm also asking you the same question,
what's this?

865
01:40:55,607 --> 01:40:58,940
Hiding so many memories and
love in your heart,

866
01:40:59,111 --> 01:41:03,047
when I sent I love you message,
will you say I don't love you, Shakti?

867
01:41:03,382 --> 01:41:05,043
I didn't say that.
- Then?

868
01:41:05,384 --> 01:41:08,012
It was a money-minded avaricious guide.

869
01:41:08,553 --> 01:41:10,953
Then, who is this officer Shakti?

870
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:14,022
You've seen it, right?
You need any answer now.

871
01:41:14,693 --> 01:41:15,853
Hello!

872
01:41:17,796 --> 01:41:19,696
You came searching for something,
did you find it or not?

873
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:22,629
Everything is here only.
Search properly.

874
01:41:25,170 --> 01:41:27,900
I found it and got your son too.

875
01:41:28,807 --> 01:41:32,174
You too come to the temple with us.
Today is my son's birthday.

876
01:41:34,846 --> 01:41:37,713
I didn't know so no gift.

877
01:41:37,883 --> 01:41:42,479
I know it. You're his biggest gift, Come.

878
01:41:50,729 --> 01:41:53,220
Greetings Jackie!
- Tell me Jaffer.

879
01:41:54,566 --> 01:41:58,832
My sister is ready to offer you
more than all other offers.

880
01:41:59,004 --> 01:42:03,839
I'll decide the rate and date
and inform you.

881
01:42:10,816 --> 01:42:14,149
Our new security specialist Avatar is here.

882
01:42:23,028 --> 01:42:24,154
Why?

883
01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:29,523
I never let even a fly to sit on
the Kohinoor diamond for 20 years.

884
01:42:29,701 --> 01:42:36,766
But by 21st century a fly sat on it
and my ego was hurt terribly.

885
01:42:36,942 --> 01:42:38,136
I resigned immediately.

886
01:42:38,477 --> 01:42:41,810
If you fail here,
you needn't have to resign.

887
01:42:44,115 --> 01:42:45,946
I'll gun you down.

888
01:42:48,019 --> 01:42:49,646
Will you see the arrangements?

889
01:43:06,571 --> 01:43:08,937
I don't see any arrangements, what?

890
01:43:17,816 --> 01:43:18,976
Use this!

891
01:43:32,664 --> 01:43:36,964
I've arranged invisible high voltage laser
beams and infra-red rays around it.

892
01:43:37,135 --> 01:43:38,261
If you touch...

893
01:43:45,844 --> 01:43:46,776
Money!

894
01:43:52,951 --> 01:43:56,011
Fakhtooni from Egypt has
agreed to my offer.

895
01:44:19,077 --> 01:44:21,375
Jackie is refusing to give the Rudra Trident.

896
01:44:22,247 --> 01:44:24,078
No matter how much I offer
he's refusing.

897
01:44:25,350 --> 01:44:28,376
I think he has settled a deal
with Egyptians.

898
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:32,679
What to do now?
I'm also confused.

899
01:44:39,598 --> 01:44:43,864
Swamy, Jwalamukhi is not
with Aishwarya too.

900
01:44:44,035 --> 01:44:46,765
Janaki Verma is refusing to give
the Rudra Trident.

901
01:44:46,938 --> 01:44:49,930
He's planning to sell it to Fakhtooni.

902
01:44:50,108 --> 01:44:51,735
What shall we do now, Swamy?

903
01:44:53,645 --> 01:44:56,978
Godess Mother will arrange it herself!

904
01:45:10,795 --> 01:45:12,353
Please offer special prayers
for my son Shaktiswaroop.

905
01:45:12,697 --> 01:45:13,391
Okay madam.

906
01:45:56,041 --> 01:45:58,373
This is the diamond box
her father was asking.

907
01:46:00,912 --> 01:46:03,176
I got this box in Haridwar.

908
01:46:29,808 --> 01:46:32,003
Found the Jwalamukhi diamond.

909
01:46:36,014 --> 01:46:37,276
Found Jwalamukhi!

910
01:46:40,952 --> 01:46:44,115
Come immediately to Hampi with Jwalamukhi
and my daughter Aishwarya.

911
01:46:44,222 --> 01:46:45,519
We'll leave immediately.

912
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:14,279
Found the Jwalamukhi diamond,
I'm leaving to Hampi with Chief.

913
01:47:36,107 --> 01:47:36,971
What?

914
01:48:14,279 --> 01:48:19,342
Brother, officer is going to Hampi
with the Jwalamukhi, let's go.

915
01:48:44,209 --> 01:48:48,407
They're after the diamond,
they know Chief is going to Hampi with it.

916
01:48:48,580 --> 01:48:49,877
They're attacking him.

917
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:52,983
You go.
You go and save them .

918
01:51:39,350 --> 01:51:42,513
Leave the place immediately with
Aishwarya and the diamond.

919
01:51:43,588 --> 01:51:44,577
Come.

920
01:52:01,305 --> 01:52:02,465
Leave him !

921
01:53:52,683 --> 01:53:54,947
The protector has arrived! Come!

922
01:54:23,447 --> 01:54:24,436
He has arrived!

923
01:54:26,817 --> 01:54:28,648
Protector has arrived!

924
01:54:31,455 --> 01:54:35,448
I know Goddess Mother has
brought him here!

925
01:54:39,163 --> 01:54:41,825
Are you surprized we're saying
as if we know you?

926
01:54:42,166 --> 01:54:43,463
You don't know who we are!

927
01:54:43,634 --> 01:54:46,432
But we've been waiting for your arrival!

928
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:49,963
For me?

929
01:54:50,308 --> 01:54:52,435
If you want to understand this,

930
01:54:52,610 --> 01:54:55,670
you must know what had
happened 27 years ago.

931
01:54:57,181 --> 01:55:00,673
Mahadevaraya's ancestors belonged
to the Royal kings.

932
01:55:01,185 --> 01:55:05,622
His father Vijayakrishna Rayalu was
blessed by Goddess Mother.

933
01:55:05,790 --> 01:55:09,021
A great God fearing and
benevolent man.

934
01:55:16,367 --> 01:55:20,269
Minister! Please arrange for
free food distribution.

935
01:55:20,438 --> 01:55:21,769
Yes my lord!

936
01:55:26,010 --> 01:55:28,035
God bless you with long life!

937
01:55:29,747 --> 01:55:33,945
Why did you ask me to come
without fail for this festival?

938
01:55:36,854 --> 01:55:42,053
The time has come to tell you
the most guarded secret.

939
01:55:44,528 --> 01:55:48,020
There are 18 temples dedicated
to Goddess Mother.

940
01:55:48,366 --> 01:55:51,802
Everyone know all are
famous pilgrim centres.

941
01:55:52,870 --> 01:56:02,802
But only we know the secret temple from
where all other 18 temples are controlled.

942
01:56:10,354 --> 01:56:14,347
With the help of this plan leaf,
the temple located secretly in Hampi,

943
01:56:14,525 --> 01:56:17,722
can be reached with Jwalamukhi diamond
and Rudra Trident.

944
01:56:17,795 --> 01:56:22,027
Our country India is prospering because
of that secret temple only,

945
01:56:22,366 --> 01:56:26,564
If that temple is destroyed,
the country would also get destroyed,

946
01:56:26,737 --> 01:56:33,666
some tribes and people of alien
nations knew about this secret,

947
01:56:33,844 --> 01:56:36,642
and attacked the place,

948
01:56:36,881 --> 01:56:39,714
unable to locate the secret temple,
they destroyed every temple they saw,

949
01:56:39,884 --> 01:56:42,717
but our clan has been protecting the
temple for centuries and offering prayers.

950
01:56:44,555 --> 01:56:48,685
An eclipse happens for every 27 years,

951
01:56:48,859 --> 01:56:56,823
only after the eclipse, one can enter
the temple and offer prayers,

952
01:56:57,001 --> 01:57:01,734
nobody can enter the temple
without the Jwalamukhi diamond.

953
01:57:16,354 --> 01:57:19,084
It shines only when in the hands
of the blessed ones.

954
01:57:19,423 --> 01:57:23,587
After your father only your progeny
will be the blessed one.

955
01:57:25,529 --> 01:57:30,660
Eclipse is approaching fast, we must
reach the temple before it elapses.

956
01:57:33,704 --> 01:57:39,165
Like the clan of Rayalu is here to
protect the divinity of the temple,

957
01:57:39,343 --> 01:57:46,772
there's a fiend in Egypt who wants to destroy
the divinity and prosperity of this nation.

958
01:57:53,023 --> 01:57:58,689
Minister Janaki Verma sold our country's
secret to the Egyptians for money.

959
01:57:58,863 --> 01:58:01,058
Got it!

960
01:58:01,399 --> 01:58:03,867
I got it!

961
01:58:04,034 --> 01:58:09,597
I found the secret which was
unknown to the world till now.

962
01:58:09,774 --> 01:58:13,938
I got an opportunity to destroy
that country.

963
01:58:14,111 --> 01:58:20,448
I'll find the Rudra Trident and
destroy that secret temple.

964
01:58:20,618 --> 01:58:23,815
Mukhtar, it's easier said than done.

965
01:58:23,988 --> 01:58:28,789
Brother! Don't you know about
my husband's bravery?

966
01:58:28,959 --> 01:58:34,761
It seems the temple is protected by divine
forces which no warrior can touch.

967
01:58:34,932 --> 01:58:37,127
Who protects it? Their God?

968
01:58:37,468 --> 01:58:39,936
Protector who secures God!

969
01:58:43,507 --> 01:58:47,910
One who protects the temple from a clan which
has been protecting since time immemorial.

970
01:58:50,948 --> 01:58:55,976
Great warrior Rudra! Maharudra!

971
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:18,563
Stop that nonsense!

972
02:00:18,736 --> 02:00:22,570
I'll not only destroy the secret temple,

973
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:26,176
the protector you said about,
I'll defeat him,

974
02:00:26,510 --> 02:00:30,310
and present his head
at my wife Fakhtooni's feet.

975
02:00:31,749 --> 02:00:38,018
My dear, my eyes will see you
again after victory only!

976
02:01:10,888 --> 02:01:13,049
Eclipse is over, come out.

977
02:01:24,101 --> 02:01:25,625
Will it be son or daughter, Swamy?

978
02:01:25,803 --> 02:01:29,068
With the blessings of Goddess Mother,
you'll have a son.

979
02:01:30,307 --> 02:01:35,267
With courage not to fear anyone,
with the bravery to oppose anyone,

980
02:01:35,613 --> 02:01:39,811
to protect the temple,
he'll be ready to sacrifice his life too.

981
02:03:53,517 --> 02:03:56,042
This is the entrance to the
secret temple.

982
02:03:56,553 --> 02:03:58,885
How much ever one may be powerful,
no weapon on earth,

983
02:03:59,156 --> 02:04:01,886
sorcery or black magic,

984
02:04:02,059 --> 02:04:06,428
nobody can open this entrance,
except this Rudra Trident.

985
02:04:07,197 --> 02:04:12,567
It's impossible to enter the temple
without this Rudra Trident.

986
02:05:51,301 --> 02:05:59,504
Hail Goddess Mother!

987
02:06:17,394 --> 02:06:21,353
Holy Ganges which flowed from
the tresses of Lord Shiva,

988
02:06:21,531 --> 02:06:25,695
the protector of the temple must
get cleansed in that holy water,

989
02:06:48,125 --> 02:06:52,585
after cleansed by the holy Ganges,
no fire can harm the protector,

990
02:06:55,132 --> 02:06:58,124
Trident is epitome of power
of Triumvirates,

991
02:07:01,471 --> 02:07:05,305
it's another form of power that
runs this universe,

992
02:07:05,475 --> 02:07:12,711
so many evil men had tried to take the
Trident and got themselves destroyed,

993
02:07:27,531 --> 02:07:33,128
these 18 pillars represent the 18 temples
of Goddess Mother all over the country.

994
02:07:37,074 --> 02:07:40,635
Daughter of Daksha,
consort of Lord Shiva,

995
02:07:40,978 --> 02:07:45,074
all these places are where the
18 pieces of Dakshyani's body fell,

996
02:07:45,248 --> 02:07:51,653
they became 18 temples dedicated to Goddess
Mother and became holy pilgrim centres.

997
02:07:51,989 --> 02:07:58,986
Each pillar represents
Goddess Mother's body parts.

998
02:07:59,162 --> 02:08:01,653
When protector touches it with
the Trident,

999
02:08:01,999 --> 02:08:03,694
as prayers are offered during
the eclipse,

1000
02:08:04,034 --> 02:08:06,764
this idol of Goddess Mother
will shine brightly,

1001
02:08:07,104 --> 02:08:13,475
with the divine touch of the Trident,

1002
02:09:19,309 --> 02:09:23,143
18 temples will aquire more powers.
18 temples will get activated.

1003
02:09:23,313 --> 02:09:28,774
As Trident is decorated to the Goddess,
with the divine touch to the Trident,

1004
02:09:29,119 --> 02:09:30,552
18 temples will aquire more powers.

1005
02:09:30,720 --> 02:09:34,315
As sunsets, the entrance will close.

1006
02:09:34,491 --> 02:09:40,896
Prayers must be offered as usually
during next eclipse after 27 years.

1007
02:10:26,877 --> 02:10:30,313
Mukhtar! That's Rudra's wife!

1008
02:10:36,386 --> 02:10:37,853
You please go inside.

1009
02:10:38,188 --> 02:10:41,214
I beg you, please go inside.
Don't go there.

1010
02:10:42,192 --> 02:10:43,659
Take madam away.

1011
02:10:56,306 --> 02:10:57,295
Where is Rudra?

1012
02:10:57,474 --> 02:11:02,411
Death comes to everyone, but you came
from far way searching for your death.

1013
02:11:02,579 --> 02:11:06,845
You will die!
Your death's name is Rudra!

1014
02:11:09,386 --> 02:11:11,752
Hey Rudra! Where are you?

1015
02:11:13,623 --> 02:11:16,285
Come out!
It seems you're a great warrior!

1016
02:11:16,459 --> 02:11:18,654
It seems you protect this secret temple.

1017
02:11:19,429 --> 02:11:19,952
Come out!

1018
02:11:20,297 --> 02:11:24,927
I'll cut your wife and
your forthcoming child into pieces.

1019
02:11:25,268 --> 02:11:27,259
You complete the prayers and come.

1020
02:11:28,171 --> 02:11:31,231
Come and save her!
Let me see what your power is!

1021
02:11:31,408 --> 02:11:32,602
Come on.

1022
02:12:13,016 --> 02:12:15,917
You invited him, right? Look there!

1023
02:12:16,253 --> 02:12:18,380
Your death is standing before you!

1024
02:12:18,588 --> 02:12:20,351
Is he my death?

1025
02:12:21,291 --> 02:12:24,260
Death means me and my men.

1026
02:12:24,427 --> 02:12:26,918
What can this alone man do?

1027
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:31,428
Except fear me!
- Fear? Me?

1028
02:12:33,436 --> 02:12:35,631
Fear fears me!

1029
02:12:35,805 --> 02:12:38,433
I don't need an army to maul you.

1030
02:12:38,608 --> 02:12:40,872
I'm alone is more than enough.

1031
02:12:41,044 --> 02:12:44,946
I'm an army, my blood is my weapon,
my people's blessings are my armour,

1032
02:12:45,282 --> 02:12:47,580
protecting temple of Goddess Mother
is my power.

1033
02:12:47,751 --> 02:12:55,419
I'll destroy this temple and
take the Trident,

1034
02:12:55,659 --> 02:12:58,594
and bring back to live
my ancestors' mummies,

1035
02:12:58,728 --> 02:13:00,821
and rule over this universe.

1036
02:13:02,432 --> 02:13:05,799
I'll present your head as gift to my wife.

1037
02:13:06,303 --> 02:13:11,468
The moment you step into the temple
and see Goddess Mother,

1038
02:13:12,042 --> 02:13:13,703
I swear on Goddess,

1039
02:13:13,877 --> 02:13:17,472
I'll behead you and consecrate
Goddess Mother with your blood.

1040
02:13:18,315 --> 02:13:23,753
The main temple of all the 18 temples
is the avtar for your sacrifice.

1041
02:14:53,676 --> 02:14:55,200
Mother...mother...

1042
02:16:01,010 --> 02:16:02,170
You leave the place!

1043
02:19:28,284 --> 02:19:29,751
You weren't born to cry!

1044
02:19:29,919 --> 02:19:36,154
You're the son of protector of this temple
who protected it till his last breath.

1045
02:19:38,161 --> 02:19:40,425
Goddess Mother will protect you!

1046
02:19:44,667 --> 02:19:45,656
Take care!

1047
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:05,218
Betrayer!

1048
02:20:54,237 --> 02:21:02,042
A great warrior who protected
the temple ended like that.

1049
02:21:03,246 --> 02:21:11,449
As the protector's son, Goddess Mother has
brought you here to save this temple.

1050
02:21:15,458 --> 02:21:16,857
It's true, Shakti.

1051
02:21:17,126 --> 02:21:20,152
We became your parents by raising you
with love and care,

1052
02:21:21,364 --> 02:21:23,298
we're not your real parents.

1053
02:21:23,533 --> 02:21:27,299
Yes, this same day 27 years ago,

1054
02:21:27,470 --> 02:21:29,802
we didn't have children and
were offering prayers for child,

1055
02:21:30,006 --> 02:21:31,337
we found you in the river Thungabhadra.

1056
02:21:31,808 --> 02:21:35,005
Am idst lamps, in the temple
of Goddess Durga,

1057
02:21:35,344 --> 02:21:37,005
we got you as a boon,

1058
02:22:02,071 --> 02:22:04,539
Basava! He lost sanity after losing you.

1059
02:22:06,542 --> 02:22:10,376
Have you understood now?
You were born for a reason.

1060
02:22:10,546 --> 02:22:16,280
You were destined to achieve a great thing,
so you were found by this couple.

1061
02:22:16,485 --> 02:22:19,477
Courage as heart beat
and adventure as breath,

1062
02:22:19,822 --> 02:22:22,382
and made you join in
the service of nation.

1063
02:22:22,825 --> 02:22:23,814
What should I do now?

1064
02:22:23,993 --> 02:22:29,932
Eclipse is approaching, Egyptians are planning
to destroy the temple again.

1065
02:22:30,099 --> 02:22:32,090
We found the Jwalamukhi
because of you.

1066
02:22:32,301 --> 02:22:35,964
You must bring back Rudra Trident too.
- Where is it now?

1067
02:22:36,138 --> 02:22:40,131
After killing your father from behind,
now settled as Jackie in Dubai,

1068
02:22:40,576 --> 02:22:41,838
It is with Minister.

1069
02:22:42,445 --> 02:22:48,850
He has kept the Trident safely
among tight security.

1070
02:22:55,358 --> 02:23:01,194
Son Rakha!

1071
02:23:25,521 --> 02:23:30,424
No Jwalamukhi can hurt him anymore.

1072
02:23:47,576 --> 02:23:49,271
Where has Jackie hidden the Trident?

1073
02:23:49,445 --> 02:23:50,605
He changed many places.

1074
02:23:50,947 --> 02:23:53,609
But now it is in beach building
among high security.

1075
02:23:54,283 --> 02:23:58,117
It is impossible to touch.
But there's a way.

1076
02:23:58,554 --> 02:24:02,149
Security incharge Avatar stays
in that building only.

1077
02:24:04,660 --> 02:24:06,457
Is Avatar there?

1078
02:24:08,664 --> 02:24:12,623
Leave me, you fools! I'm here to
join as assistant to Avatar.

1079
02:24:12,969 --> 02:24:13,628
Leave me.

1080
02:24:14,971 --> 02:24:16,029
Who the hell are you man?

1081
02:24:16,205 --> 02:24:18,332
My name is Rama Rao from Nimmakur.

1082
02:24:19,175 --> 02:24:21,336
really great that you've come
all the way from Nimmakur.

1083
02:24:21,510 --> 02:24:25,139
Not only you, entire state feels great
about Nimmakur Rama Rao.

1084
02:24:25,314 --> 02:24:26,372
Just a minute.

1085
02:24:28,150 --> 02:24:29,139
Lemon form my village.

1086
02:24:29,318 --> 02:24:32,151
If you rub it on head,
your brain will work sharply.

1087
02:24:32,321 --> 02:24:33,481
You need it.

1088
02:24:34,991 --> 02:24:36,982
You brought a lemon from Nimmakur,

1089
02:24:37,159 --> 02:24:39,491
would you bring a pumpkin
had you come from Guntur?

1090
02:24:41,998 --> 02:24:43,329
Liked it so much?
- Very much sir.

1091
02:24:43,499 --> 02:24:44,727
Boss is calling you.

1092
02:24:46,168 --> 02:24:46,725
Boss?

1093
02:24:47,103 --> 02:24:50,004
You're my God and
do you've a boss here?

1094
02:24:50,172 --> 02:24:51,161
How can he be my boss?

1095
02:24:52,742 --> 02:24:56,007
He wanted some security and was
ready to pay handsomely, so I'm here.

1096
02:24:56,178 --> 02:24:58,510
What are you securing sir?
- Securing what?

1097
02:24:58,681 --> 02:25:01,343
An antique item Jackie has,
I'm giving scientific security.

1098
02:25:02,018 --> 02:25:04,179
What a great security
you would've given!

1099
02:25:05,755 --> 02:25:07,746
How can I not show you?

1100
02:25:12,328 --> 02:25:13,659
Is he Jackie?

1101
02:25:13,996 --> 02:25:17,659
He's Jackie, very bad man.
Always roams with girls.

1102
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,662
What is he using? Snuff powder?
- No!

1103
02:25:21,170 --> 02:25:25,664
I don't want to see him, please show
the item you're protecting.

1104
02:25:26,008 --> 02:25:28,670
How can I not show when
you're so interested!

1105
02:25:29,011 --> 02:25:32,174
Look here! See! See!

1106
02:25:33,015 --> 02:25:34,346
Hold this sir!

1107
02:25:35,017 --> 02:25:39,181
Enough of learning for today,
I must join as your disciple.

1108
02:25:39,355 --> 02:25:41,186
As fee I've brought Rs.1 crore,
please accept it.

1109
02:25:41,357 --> 02:25:43,348
Rs.1 crore?
- Yes, Rs.1 crore!

1110
02:25:43,526 --> 02:25:45,687
I don't want.
- You must take it.

1111
02:25:46,028 --> 02:25:48,519
Then, let's go.
Come sir...come.

1112
02:25:49,365 --> 02:25:50,024
Where's the money?

1113
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:51,698
It's here!

1114
02:25:52,334 --> 02:25:53,130
Take it.

1115
02:25:54,503 --> 02:25:56,698
Rs.1 crore.
- Yes, Rs.1 crore! Rs.1 crore!

1116
02:26:01,544 --> 02:26:02,670
Open it sir.

1117
02:26:02,845 --> 02:26:04,540
I'll open it!

1118
02:26:08,050 --> 02:26:09,642
With great devotion and respect!

1119
02:26:13,089 --> 02:26:14,784
Lemons!

1120
02:26:19,261 --> 02:26:21,092
You gave full details to someone.

1121
02:26:21,430 --> 02:26:22,590
You allowed him to enter my place.

1122
02:26:23,432 --> 02:26:24,763
What was his offer?
What did he gave you?

1123
02:26:25,234 --> 02:26:27,725
He gave sir...lemon from Nimmakur!

1124
02:26:28,437 --> 02:26:29,267
What for?

1125
02:26:29,438 --> 02:26:31,338
To rub our head for good sharp brain.

1126
02:26:31,507 --> 02:26:32,769
Use it, sir.
- Lemon!

1127
02:26:43,319 --> 02:26:44,513
Somebody has trapped us!

1128
02:26:50,526 --> 02:26:53,689
Money is ready, we're coming to you.

1129
02:26:53,863 --> 02:26:57,799
I'm coming to Marina with Rudra Trident.
- Okay Jackie!

1130
02:28:15,377 --> 02:28:17,709
See! See properly!

1131
02:28:18,714 --> 02:28:20,181
Your death!

1132
02:28:20,382 --> 02:28:22,873
the man you stabbed from behind
unable to face him,

1133
02:28:23,552 --> 02:28:26,385
the man whose power will
make death too shudder,

1134
02:28:26,555 --> 02:28:31,891
Rudra! I'm Rudra's son!

1135
02:28:32,528 --> 02:28:37,591
You thought history is over!
But his blood is still alive in my form .

1136
02:28:38,267 --> 02:28:43,398
I swear in his name,
I'll not let you live.

1137
02:28:45,241 --> 02:28:47,232
Only if you're alive!

1138
02:29:15,271 --> 02:29:16,602
Rudra Trident is in my hands.

1139
02:29:16,839 --> 02:29:18,773
I'm leaving now, tell your father.

1140
02:29:19,608 --> 02:29:20,233
Come fast!

1141
02:29:21,844 --> 02:29:23,277
I'll be in your thoughts till you come.

1142
02:29:54,877 --> 02:30:02,010
Your beauty is like eight wonder...
It's forcing me to go for you...

1143
02:30:02,484 --> 02:30:09,014
You're majestic like young tiger...
You're out to steal my heart...

1144
02:30:09,558 --> 02:30:18,398
O my dear, my temperature
shoots up on seeing you...

1145
02:30:18,834 --> 02:30:22,736
If you come near, I'm cool like moon...

1146
02:30:22,905 --> 02:30:26,500
I like you, my maiden...
watch out I'm coming for you...

1147
02:30:26,675 --> 02:30:30,338
I like your power...
you're the A-1 star...

1148
02:31:25,667 --> 02:31:31,037
You're everything to me, my darling...
I've trapped you...

1149
02:31:31,373 --> 02:31:35,366
You flattered me with gestures...

1150
02:31:35,711 --> 02:31:39,374
You're my wife, my life and
mother of my kids...

1151
02:31:39,548 --> 02:31:41,379
I'll share everything with you...

1152
02:31:41,550 --> 02:31:45,543
Without saving anything,
I've given myself fully to you...

1153
02:31:45,854 --> 02:31:49,381
You were just a bud till yesterday...

1154
02:31:49,558 --> 02:31:52,857
I've bloomed with your arrival...

1155
02:31:53,028 --> 02:32:01,902
My dear, come to me...

1156
02:32:02,404 --> 02:32:06,067
I've given you my heart, take it...

1157
02:32:52,488 --> 02:32:57,892
You must be very fortunate to get me...
You must have a range...

1158
02:32:58,060 --> 02:33:01,996
As your eyes fall on me,
my drapes slip down...

1159
02:33:02,664 --> 02:33:08,000
O my dear, youth and beauty is short lived,
saved it for the best day...

1160
02:33:08,170 --> 02:33:12,231
It's com motion and passions
have taken over me...

1161
02:33:12,808 --> 02:33:16,141
You've given everything you ever
wanted to give...

1162
02:33:16,478 --> 02:33:19,777
You've come true as my dream boy...

1163
02:33:19,948 --> 02:33:28,947
O my dear, your waist is
younger sister of rainbow...

1164
02:33:29,124 --> 02:33:33,151
Take on me and
switch on the love game...

1165
02:34:07,529 --> 02:34:14,935
Eclipse is over, prayers must be
offered before the sunset.

1166
02:34:35,857 --> 02:34:36,949
Die!

1167
02:35:11,693 --> 02:35:12,284
Where is Shakti, uncle?

1168
02:35:12,628 --> 02:35:15,119
Somebody was following us,
so he's coming the other way.

1169
02:35:15,731 --> 02:35:17,358
He asked you to start the prayers.

1170
02:35:17,799 --> 02:35:20,359
Shakti will come,
you start offering the prayers, Swamy.

1171
02:36:16,091 --> 02:36:19,822
Hey Sadhu! You can't offer prayers!
We'll destroy it!

1172
02:36:19,995 --> 02:36:25,365
To see that destruction, I've placed
my son's eyes with my husband's.

1173
02:36:27,302 --> 02:36:29,827
Let me see who will protect
the temple now!

1174
02:36:30,005 --> 02:36:31,836
The protector will not come!

1175
02:36:35,143 --> 02:36:38,635
Fakhtooni has bought
