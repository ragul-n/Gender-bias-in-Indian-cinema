Hello
Tell me brother!

3
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,442
Can I dare talk about rate
with you, brother?

4
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:34,317
You're calling me after long time,
I had my training with you.

5
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,318
Okay brother, I'll do it for you.

6
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,387
You sleep peacefully.
Okay, no problem.

7
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,796
He has come so far crossing
the border of Tamil Nadu.

8
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,737
Matter serious.
Come on boys!

9
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:07,620
Have you got him?

10
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,515
We've locked the check post.

11
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,849
Nobody can get out of this area.

12
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:12,649
He'll be caught.

13
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,053
Tell me after you've caught him.

14
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,319
Don't get tensed, brother.

15
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,657
He'll wag tail like a dog
before me in 10 minutes.

16
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,299
You come here, brother.

17
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,171

Are you the man brother
told me about?

Call brother, tell him we got him.

21
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,384
Are you a Tamil?

22
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,956
That's why you're hot headed!
You're very brave!

23
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:34,404
What shall we take first
from him, hand or leg?

24
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,904
Ask brother.

25
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,639
If you cross brother's path,
you can never escape.

26
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:07,662
Don't touch him!

27
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:31,029
What the hell is happening?

28
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,130
Brother, he managed to escape.
We're after him.

00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,312
Before joining as the physical trainer,

32
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,676
get the signature from physical
HOD Mr. Varun Sandesh.

33
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:58,509
Thank you sir.

00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,651
- Sound?
- Sir exercising.

36
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,088
Breathing effect.

37
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,590
Looks like exercises heavily.

38
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,229
My right hand biceps is ready!

39
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:25,142

- Varun Sandesh sir.
- What?

43
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,261
I'm coming from Madras.

44
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,433
I'm in Kolkata, please tell me.

45
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,395
Your...

46
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,568
He's wedging me as soon he has come.

47
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,932
- I'll wedge you.
- No sir, new appointment, signature.

48
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,130
Signature? Why?

49
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,773
Why is he saying kiss for signature?

50
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,409
- Are you a Tamil?
- How did you find it?

51
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,445
Your Hindi too is broken like mine.

52
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,546
Tell me.

53
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,080
I've joined here as the
new physical trainer.

54
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,548
Principal asked me to get
your signature.

55
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:12,190
If you want me to sign, your biceps
must be minimum 7 inches.

56
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,358
Show!

57
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,964
- Why?
- Looks like original.

58
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,463
But smaller than yours, sir.

59
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,294
I like your humbleness.

60
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,866
How many hours do you
exercise every day?

61
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,302
- 25 hours!
- 25 hours?

62
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,976
I'll take one hour loan from
next day to exercise.

63
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,939
Don't touch me, I'll go burst.

64
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,808
In anger! Got shocked for this?

65
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,313
Look at them!

66
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,976
That's how they looked before
coming to me for training.

67
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:49,061
I turned lanky fellows into such men!

68
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,899
I hear some sound!

69
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,699
I'm feeling sultry.

70
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,170
- Just one sign.
- No, I must exercise now.

71
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:02,841
Just one sign.

72
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,703
Look, you want the job or not.

73
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,776
Listen to me, don't spoil my mood,
go... go... out!

74
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,674
Get lost... get lost!

75
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,610
Looks like one of the balloon is weak.

76
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,546
- No way that side sir.
- If there's no way, go this side.

77
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,654
Walk in air, giving me tension
as balloon is deflating.

78
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,494
Excuse me

79
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,896
- Aren't you Aishwarya?
- Yes.

80
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,004
I've joined this college as
the physical trainer.

81
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,071
I heard there's a portion
for rent in your house.

82
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:40,109
Sorry, I've let it out to someone.

83
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,573
I'm a paying guest with my friend,
a portion is vacant in their house.

84
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,247
I'll ask and let you know.

85
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,350
Okay.

86
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:51,582

You clapped your hands
at night in my eyes...

103
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,750
If you use your tresses as fishing rods,
droves of men would get trapped easily...

104
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:07,790
Don't bite the hearts with
your snake like eyes...

105

Speed of lute and ivory...
You're my beginning and end...

silvery diamond like teeth...

Each flower has a distinct colour,
but you've all seven colours...

My hands are itching to pinch you...
Don't go away from me...

Don't worry.
Be careful!

You don't worry.

132
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,527
I don't think you'll get the house.

133
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,060
Why?

134
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,566
Vacant portion is in her house only.

00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,703
Looks like someone is here.
I'm exposing!

140
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,439
This is body, head and legs!

141

Come, Malaiyur Mambattiyan.

142
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,520
What are you doing here master?

143
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:28,988
I'm taking moon bath.

144
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,321
- Moon bath?
- Yes.

145
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:37,093
Normally master takes sun bath,
today I'm taking moon bath under cover.

146
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,602
Master, please remove the cover
and show your biceps.

147
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,832
If I show my body while
taking moon bath,

148
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:50,607
it'll affect the old lady
frying vada on moon.

149
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:56,076
Sir, someone is sleeping there carelessly
while you're taking moon bath here.

150
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,812
- I will...
- No!

151
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,954
He tried to disturb me while
taking moon bath,

152
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,324
I pinned him down with power
and he's dead.

153
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,396
- You come to the position.
- Okay sir.

154
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,157
What's this sir?

155
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,328
Oh bad smell!

156
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,167
Don't which bloody fool kept it here?

157
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,538
What sort of a stuff is this,
very bad smell!

158
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:24,773
Useless! Instead of drinking this,
it's better to have a bottle of phenol.

159
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,651
Useless man!

160
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,747
Man who drinks this stuff would
definitely be a dummy!

161
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:39,525
Man drinking this stinking stuff
wouldn't be from a good family.

162
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,458
Disgraceful man!

163
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,168
Why are you crying, master?

164
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,965
Tears will drop down as moon bath
crosses three fourths.

165
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,300
Why did you all come here?

166
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,145
What's all this?

167
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,976
New comer Balu insulted me today.

168
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,812
We're here to cool it.

169
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,788
Take it, Paru.

170
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,657
Why are you trying this new habit, Paru?

171
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,054
Gulp?!

172
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:14,596
Hey Balu! Do you know about me?

173
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,564
Chilly! I'm a chilly!

174
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,828
Lt'll burn!

175
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,238
I'll rape you!

176
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,706
You'll cry falling at my feet!

177
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,238
He'll not cry but ask you once more.

178
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:33,016
Paru, you're going overboard.

179
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,412
Go home.

180
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,821
Why have I become
like Vishal of 'Avan'?

181
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,028
Aishwarya told me,
I'll come to the point.

182
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,253
Please sit down.

183
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,426
I don't have any problem in
letting the house on rent.

184
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,295
- But I've few conditions.
- Tell me sir.

185
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:51,935
Mustn't have drinking habit.

186
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,703
I hate if anyone dances on
road like modern youth.

187
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,884
Escpecially my daughter hates it.

188
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,748
That's how I've raised her.
I'm very strict.

189
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,049
What's it?

190
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,825
I'll inform my daughter for safer side.

191
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:15,959
Okay sir.

192
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,254
- She's offering prayers.
- I can hear sir.

193
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,899
She's Meera in devotion.

194
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,091
Yes sir.

195
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,328
- Would you like to have coffee?
- No thanks, sir.

196
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,836
Have it, home made coffee
will be excellent.

197
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,305
Padma, get one coffee.

198
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,678
- No need sir.
- Nothing to fear.

199
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,076
What's that sound, Padma?
Get one coffee.

200
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,417
My wife hates to make any guest wait.

201
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,591
That's why tumbler has come first.
I'll get the coffee.

202
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,924
Your college coach,
he's here for vacant house.

203
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,895
Greetings.

204
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,402
Acting docile in home but
dare and bare outside.

205
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:05,043
Father, a bachelor with young
unmarried girl in home...

206
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,472
You're right.

207
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,804
I'm here with recommendation.

208
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,503
Is it college seat to oblige
recommendation?

209
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,047
It's a home, it's a disciplined home.

210
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,618
You're right again,
if my daughter says, no appeal.

211
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,920
- Sir, coffee for the guest.
- He too is right.

212
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,863
I want you to get dismissed from college,
how dare you come to my house.

213
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,625
- Go away!
- Strong recommendation.

214
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,235
No recommendation.

215
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,804
Burning chilly... hot chilly...

216
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,375
I've recorded your act
after a drinking binge.

217
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,039
Yes recommendation.

218
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,912
Father, you can give the house on rent.

219
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,383
Young unmarried girl, bachelor,
your point was correct.

220
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,024
He's a Tamil, we should give
him the house, father.

221
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,251
You're right!
You're from Tamil Nadu, right?

222
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,123
Yes, she too is a Tamil girl! See!

223
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,731
It's indecent to see others' phone.

224
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,198
Tamil? From our state!

225
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,995
Wait, I'll get you breakfast.

226
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,499
Have it!

227
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,979
Tuticorin

228
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,617
Sudden turn in the case against
Industrialist Easwaramurthy,

229
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,847
VIP of Tuticorin and
industrialist Easwaramurthy,

230
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,855
who is facing charges of running
kangaroo courts, land grabbing,

231
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,029
kidnappings, murders and
many other criminal charges,

232
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,289
the case is coming up in court.

233
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:37,491
Amidst many advocates withdrawing
from taking up this case,

234
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,671
acclaimed advocate Raghavaiah has taken
charge as the Public Prosecutor,

235
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:43,272
he has argued many cases against
anti-socials and sent them to jail...

236
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,500
I consider it as my duty that
a criminal must get punished.

237
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,943
General expectation is Easwaramurthy
would be sentenced.

238
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,112
Who are you?

239
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,187
- I'm Easwaramurthy's son.
- Are you the accused's son?

240
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,619
If you think my father will be free.

241
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,053
Get down.

242
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,320
You're a nuisance, get down
or else I'll call police.

243
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,053
My father is innocent, sir.

244
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,631
- Nothing is true.
- Let the court decide it.

245
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,234
I've complete evidence of your
father's wrong doings.

246
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,701
- He can't escape.
- I beg you sir.

247
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,466
Sentiments will not work,
only punishments will.

248
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,840
Sir, this boy met with an accident,
he's fighting for life sir.

249
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,041
My son!

250
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,386
Bring him in, please be careful.

251
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,216
My dear son!
What has happened to you?

252
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,448
You went to school normally.

253
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,321
Driver, go fast to the hospital.

254
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,497
What's this sir?
You said sentiment will not work.

255
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:44,828
Always only sentiments work out
in this world.

256
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:50,598
You've another daughter, right?
She too studies in the same school, right?

257
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:52,775
Be careful!

258
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:15,231
Why are you playing cricket like football?
Come here.

259
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,526
There are rules to play cricket.
Go.

260
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,897
Watch my play and use it
while playing matches.

261
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,098
Why are you staring at me?
Go and bowl!

262
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,774
Go back.

263
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,137
Bowl!

264
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,704
Stop!

265
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,810
Strong balloon!

267
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,538
- Master!
- Why can't you bowl on the bat?

268
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,179
- I did aim at the bat only.
- What do you think of yourself?

269
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,178
I'll not spare you, I'll beat you.

270
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,381
I'll rip you off.

271
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,644
Rascal, you'll lose job if I don't sign.

272
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,550
Varun master is the perfect man
to take him to task.

273
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,783
Are you playing with my life?
What if anything happens?

274
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,756
Must draw a sketch for him.

275
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,607
I forgot to keep a balloon there!

276
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,212
Can't bear it!

277
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:39,709
Master!

278
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,217
Master, I don't love you!

279
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,788
I don't like you!

280
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,096
I don't think you're handsome.

281
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:57,195
But I fear all this may happen.

282
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,301
The new comer Balu...

283
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:09,910
You carry on.

284
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:15,148
Master, your assistant is torturing...

285
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,487
You must take him to task...

00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,143
Wow master! You're just great!

288

- Do you want me to knock off his head?
- No master.

289
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,151
- Leg?
- No!

290
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:54,848
- Hand?
- No!

291
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:55,822
Then?

292
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,858
I want his cell phone, master.

293
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,860
Do you like his cell phone so much?

294
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,930
He's blackmailing me with a video.

295
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,624
Oh! Cyber crime!

296
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,933
Don't cry, I'll get you a balloon.

297
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,469
You don't worry, I'll take care of him.

298
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,143
I found the balloon, I'll get it for you.

299
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:13,868
Balloon!

300
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,240
Don't worry, you'll get the phone.

301
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,144
Will it happen really sir?
I've lost my peace of mind.

302
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,342
- Lost the balloon!
- What balloon?

303
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,215
I said your worries will
fly away like balloon.

304
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,390
I'm trusting you only sir.

305
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,991
He has many balloons.

306
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:32,060
- Get something to eat for me.
- Now?

307
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,025
Yes, I'm losing protein from my body.

308
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:36,791
Get it fast.

309
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:37,593
What do you want sir?

310
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,498
Get some peas or baked beans. Go quickly.

311
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:44,903
Go quickly and come back leisurely.

312
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,080
Take it.

313
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,151
I must fill air now.

314
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,845
This is helium gas balloon!

315
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,285
Give me the pump.

316
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:04,087
No pump in the helium gas balloons.

317
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,689

Where did he go away?

320
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,290
He told me get something to eat
and vanished.

321
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,253
Must've gone to steal the phone.

322
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,958
Did I fill helium gas in the balloons?

323
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:54,370
Balu, 6 pack is not enough for you,
I'll prepare 10 pack for you.

324
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:57,807
It's him!

00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,508
Master, I'm Balu here.

326
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,913
I'm balloon here, go ahead.

327
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,520
- You wanted to meet me?
- Yes, where are you?

00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,190
- Here!
- Here?

329
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,552
Where?

330
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,853
- In library.
- Library?

331
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,996
You asked me to come, right?
Where should I come?

332
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,496
Come to the godown next to the library.

333
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,438
Welcome to fight location.

334
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,265
Fight?

335
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,465
Did you expect to ogle at girls?

336
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:28,043
- Once in a village a farmer lived.
- It means?

337
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,113
Only one lion can roar from a cave.

338
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,214
Have you insured your life?

339
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:38,149
Are you an insurance agent?
Then, I need a policy...

340
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,324
Hello! Making fun of me?

341
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:45,360
If you had insured,
it'll help your family after your death.

342
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,554
- But I'm alive.
- That's till this moment.

343
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:51,133
In few moments, I'll break your ribs!

344
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,466
Break your sides!

345
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,039
Smack your stomach!

346
00:27:58,043 --> 00:27:59,476
Rip open your liver!

347
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,645
Do you run a mutton stall too?
Then, give me 250 grams of...

348
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,043
Stop it!

349
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:10,051
I've been watching you,
you're very arrogant.

350
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,847
No fear, right?

351
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:17,495
Just do what I say,
shut down the shutter, go!

352
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:20,897
Master is terrific!

353
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,327
Master is chanceless and excellent!

354
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,992
Keep the shutter open little!

355
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,503
- Only then it'll help to escape.
- Okay.

356
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,141
Don't miss this action episode.

357
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,143
Where is your cell phone?

358
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,745
Why do you want it, master?

359
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,924
- Can't I avoid fighting you?
- Yes.

360
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:56,225
Paru, come to my side.

361
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,095
Now, see the game.

362
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,072
What's your answer to my weapon?

363
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,940
Can I also use a weapon?

364
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,548
Use it! Come on show!

365
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,816
Would this pin take my life?

366
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:22,788
May be not life but air will!

367
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,258
Air... you mean air!

368
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:28,455
This body is nothing but
a bag filled with air.

369
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,128
What are you saying?

370
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,461
I saw it.

371
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,544
- No... no...
- Just only once!

372
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:48,408
I think violence will cross limit,
all of you please leave.

373
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,247
Sir, we don't want to miss the action.

374
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:54,858
No, violence will disturb you
and you may fail in exam.

375
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,152
Please listen to me,
all of you get out.

376
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,922
- Master has ordered, let's go.
- All of you get out.

377
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,598
We're leaving without seeing
him getting beaten up.

378
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:10,234
Hello Balu, let this matter
be between us only, got it?

379
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:16,107
If it gets leaked out, I may have to
unnecessarily fall at your feet.

380
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,619
I said sorry, right?
Why did you rap on my head?

381
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,450
Mind your work.

382
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:31,288
Balu, I know your dream.

383
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:35,054
If this matter is out,
you'll lose yourjob, get going.

384
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:41,294
Since clear evidence is
against Easwaramurthy,

385
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,303
I'm sure my arguments will
get him punishment.

386
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,535
Sir, you must think over it.
Don't think we're threatening you.

387
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,246
Ready to pay as much as you ask.

388
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,643
If you want land I'll get it for free.

389
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,414
Please ask me sir.

390
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,590
Tell me something.

391
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:05,987
Why do you lose life for honesty
and duty without accepting bribe?

392
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:10,065
Poor man, lost his life.

393
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,498
Live from honest public prosecutor
Padmanabhan's home,

394
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,172
your son Raja.

395
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:24,345
Excellent! Rocking!

396
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,608
Where should I see, master?

397
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,246
Spade in the wheel of fun.
Look there!

398
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,519
Please say something.

399
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,451
I was born in Madurai,
my father was born in Thanjavur...

400
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,682
Did your grandma die in Kumbakonam?
Get lost!

401
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:35,359
Please ask something.

402
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,187
Master, you took a loan
of Rs.50 from me.

403
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,362
- Take my purse and leave the place.
- Thanks master.

404
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,590
Master, let's take his cell phone.

405

AYNGARAN DVD

406
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,449
Balu, leave it!

407
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:06,885
What's this body?

408
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,060
It's very weak, I don't see any
shape in your body.

409
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:13,458
I'm ashamed to call you
as my assistant.

410
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,292
Be on the job.

411
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:24,074
Losing concentration,
come with me, I'll teach you.

412
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,744
Be careful, master!

413
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,245
It's a new technique.

414
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,519
Mirrors are on all sides, right?
I'll plan something.

415
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:43,255
Front is okay, but back is little weak.

416
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:47,090
We'll make it strong, okay?
Ready, come on...

417
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,265
Bend frontwards.
Bend well. Bend like this.

418
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,937
This is Kung Fu of bending steps!

419
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:58,939
Now, slightly lift the right leg.
Come on, right leg, that 's it.

420
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,111
Keep it like that and
now lift your left leg.

421
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,280
Master!
- Can't you do it? You don't have stamina.

422
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:07,611
Okay, leave it, keep both legs down
and one... two...

423
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,946
That's it! You work on it well.

424
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,452
You watch the ground,
you shouldn't see other side.

425
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,124
You do it, you check it.

426
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,626
- What?
- Done.

427
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,452
So fast?

428
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:18,628
- Pick up that steering.
- It's weight, master.

429
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,388
Won't you pick up the steering
if it's heavy?

430
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:24,125
Just do what I say.
Come fast. Come to the position.

431
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,303
- Keep it like this.
- Why?

432
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:31,806
No questions please. Just endure it.
Now do like this.

433
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,135
Close your eyes.
Can you see anything? - No.

434
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:34,811
That's what I want.

435
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,311
There's a hole in the centre,
don't see from it.

436
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,410
This exercise is to develop
driving muscles. Got it?

437
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,143
Keep it closer to the face.
You mustn't see anything, okay?

438
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,822
Do it 30 times without stopping.

439
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,322
Next exercise is weight lifting, come.

440
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,157
Don't know in which bag the phone is!

441
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,992
Instead of building Taj Mahal for lover,

442
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,499
if we develop our body like Nayakar Mahal,
girls will fall on their own.

443
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,663
Ready, lift it and count to ten.

444
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,400
Master, I've a doubt, lift it yourself.

445
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:17,683
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine...

446
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,525
- Give me the phone.
- Which phone?

447
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,701
My phone.

448
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,968
Search in the place you kept it.

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,658

451
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,222
Master!

452
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:15,402
I sang for you, my dear...

453
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:27,089
I laughed at myself, my dear...

454
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:35,763
Don't touch my waist.

455
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:40,596
What happened?

456
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:43,435
It's been many days since I've seen
such a love story in Tamil.

457
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,541
Love is everywhere...

458
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:49,940
What has happened to you?

459
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,116
Anyone touching my waist,
I feel like jolted.

460
00:35:56,654 --> 00:36:00,613
- Accelerator wire is cut.
- What to do now?

461
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,450
What happened?

462
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,286
Vehicle skidded and
accelerator wire is cut.

463
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,620
Come, I'll drop you.

464
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,462
We'll not come with strangers.

465
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,190
Kolkata... midnight... be careful.

466
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:11,557
Scaring me?

467
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,567
You would've seen lion in zoo,
or on Discovery channel,

468
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:15,704
or in films,

469
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,401
have you seen a lioness roaring
in the middle of road in Kolkata?

470
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,804
He left long back.

471
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:27,973
He got scared.

472
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,744
Look there!

473
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,588
Two drunken lions are coming.

474
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:43,494
- I want this black and white.
- I too want the black and white.

475
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,568
- Are they talking about us?
- No, about you.

476
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,241
- I want her.
- No, I want her.

477
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,340
You won't scold me if
I suggest something, okay?

478
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:02,347
Balu has come back.
Let's go with him.

479
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,682
Why are you talking to yourself there?

480
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,950
We know Balu very well.
Come fast.

481
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,869
Thanks Balu.

482
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,206
- Don't go out at nights.
- Okay.

483
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:37,210
I don't have your phone,
I didn't steal it, see! Okay, bye!

484
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,166
Get some water, Paru.

485
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,301

Your face is the moon in my sky...

00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:48,788
It's talking to me without
making appearance...

493
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:54,363
Is it love?

A dream I see every day...

499
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:50,676
On the sidewalks of the streets
seeking shade at high noon...

500
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:56,918
I've seen you like the gentle breeze
trying to touch and go...

501
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:08,363
I stepped on a quicksand...
Heard the noise with nails...

502
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:13,870

you about my love...

Waited if you come out for me...

508
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:21,271
Left studies, forgot close friends...

509
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:27,543
I saw the clock that never moves...

I want this life for eternity...

She's trouble to the core.

517
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,825
You're not vacating my house
and not paying rent for 6 months.

518
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,831
What will I do?
Please pay the rent.

519
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,504
I'll not pay.
Can't you understand if I tell once?

520
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,831
- Get going.
- Hello!

521
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,840
You too have a daughter, right?
Be careful.

522
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,008
You know about me, right?

523
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,840
I trusted you since you were
a Tamil and let it on rent.

524
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,516
I'm paying my college fee
with the rent.

525
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:38,082
Please pay the rent,
if not I've to stop my studies.

526
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,348
Don't worry, you can pass without studying.

527
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,857
- There's a route for it.
- Take your hands off her!

528
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:47,096
Have you got someone to support?
What's the connection?

529
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:59,033
You're acting brave because there are
so many of your men here, right?

530
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,710
Yes, what will you do now?

531
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,106
If you were really born to one father,

532
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:09,947
keep the smile on your face and the hand
that touched Aishwarya safely for a minute,

533
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,891
Keep smiling!

till you make a woman cry.

536
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:07,100
If you come here again,
you'll feel sorry for being born.

537
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:16,019
Thanks Balu.

538
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:24,291
- What?
- I got hurt. It's paining.

539
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,464
It's bleeding, I'll get bandage.

540
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,892
Few wounds never get healed
with any medicine.

541
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,695
Aishwarya's father and
I were good friends.

542
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:38,739
Poor couple died in an accident.

543
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,477
Ever since then she's in troubles.

544
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:52,980
It's a curse to live alone and
that too for a girl it's too much.

545
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,820
No girl must face this.

546
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,833
Can you let your house on rent to me?

547
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:14,906
- I'll not trouble you,
I'll pay rent properly. - Okay.

548
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:15,837
Thanks.

549
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:25,849
All the evidence against father
have turned favourable to us.

550
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:29,856
Public prosecutor has produced
evidence in favour of us.

551
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,188
In 10 days we'll get the judgement
that father is free.

552
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:43,197
Father must feel happy,
when he comes out of the jail,

553
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,475
he must get what he wants.

554
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:51,272
Got a phone call from Cuttack Mansoor,
he took the bus to Kolkata route.

555
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:57,482
Search every place thoroughly till Kolkata.

556
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,216
- Coffee!
- Thank you.

557
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,552
Bathroom heater is short circuited,
can you please check?

558
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,160
Okay.

559
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,732
- It's urgent, I need to take bath.
- Take it.

560
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,233
Didn't finish it?

561
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,919
What are you doing?
I must fix the heater, leave me.

562
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:33,916
- Fix me before fixing the heater.
- Leave me.

563
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,423
If you want me to leave you, kiss me.

564
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:44,127
Is it kiss?
Love... romance...

565
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,874

- I love you...
- What has happened to you?

568
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,959
Mother... is not easy!
Without mother nothing is there.

569
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,793
For that, is it the way?

570
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:22,531
One day I scolded you for not
making good dosa, right?

571
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,633
Ever since I'm unable to eat dosa, mother.

572
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:25,866
Please forgive me, mother.

573
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:29,737
My daughter so innocent,
get up my dear.

574
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,815
I love you, mom.
I love you so much!

You're still a little girl.
How much you love me!

- I love you, mom.

- Please have breakfast.
- Got any other problem in home?

580
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:50,990
Didn't pay the electric bill yet?

581
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,498
- Hello!
- Master!

582
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:58,066

Okay, you finish the song,

Sir, I love someone.

590
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:54,460
His smile... his height...
His physique...

591
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,391
Everything... everything in him
is killing me.

592
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:06,338
I don't know if he loves me or not.

593
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,408
Is it so difficult to find this?

594
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:15,745
Why don't you look at the handsome
face and ask him directly?

595
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,084
You're feeling shy.
Shall I give you a good idea?

596
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,256
Tell me sir.

597
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:24,422
- Take a good car.
- I don't have a car.

598

- Can you give me your car?
- Sure!

599
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:33,660
- Almost dry of petrol, fill the tank.
- I don't have that much money.

00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:39,307
- Don't worry!
- So sweet!

601

Speed away on the highway
with your lover in the car,

602
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,281
go on till you run out of petrol,

603

if your lover doesn't ask
where are we going in between?

604
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,121
It means he loves you.

605
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:59,785
Tell him, I love as soon as petrol goes dry.

606
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,294
- Wow!
- Tell him!

- When do you want me to be ready?
- Why?

610
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,565
I must go on long ride with you, right?

611
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:13,474

The best thing I like in you
is your sense of comedy.

- Comedy?
- Yes sir.

I don't love you, I don't like you,
I don't think you're handsome,

617

but I fear all this may happen,
you said this, right?

618

Any message to them on return?

692
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,193
They'll not come back.

693
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:34,931
Tell me.

694
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:37,332
I want to tell you very
important thing today.

695
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,371
- What?
- Surprize!

696
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,807
I've arranged a party today evening
in Aqua Java club.

697
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,545
I'll tell you there, please make it.

698
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:49,383
I'll tell everyone about our love.

699
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,715
- Why are you throwing a party?
- Relax, he's coming. It's a surprize.

700
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,228
First find him!

701
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:04,398
If he comes to know first that we're here,
we'll not be alive.

702
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:05,400
Correct.

703
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:08,730
Wait!

704
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:17,906
Brother, local gangs arranged by us
are searching for him.

705
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,946
- He's coming.
- Excuse me.

706
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:35,155
What happened?

707
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:39,427
You're very beautiful, shall we have a ball
in the room, I asked her.

708
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,604
- You idiot!
- Why are you getting angry?

709
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,772
Are you feeling bad for not inviting you?

710
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,108
Both of you are okay to me.

711
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,668
Bloody rascal!

712
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,950
- Leave me!
- Come!

713
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,622
Catch her.
Go inside!

714
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,455
Father! What's it father?

715
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:08,620
I got it what we were searching
like blood hounds.

716
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,698
- What are you saying, dad?
- I got the photo.

717
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:12,798
Send the photo, dad.

718
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,799
I'll send it right now.
Come immediately.

719
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,131
Leave me.

720
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:21,641
Aishwarya! Are you okay?

721
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,648
Stop the vehicle.

722
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,653
Reverse!

723
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,325
Who are you guys?

724
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:48,937
Dad, you got the photo,
I've the girl with me.

725
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,106
I'm bringing her.
Get in.

726
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:13,351
- Leave me.
- Shut her mouth.

727
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:19,360
Catch her!

728
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,710
Mustn't leave her!

729
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,059
See if she escapes.

730
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:55,397
I got you!

731
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:01,134
Catch her!

732
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:12,353
Let's go, they're dangerous people. Come.

Open your eyes and look at me!

Open your eyes!

Catch him! Catch him!

Stop him... kill him...

01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:26,007
Leave me... leave me...
I'll never come for you again.

742
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,405
No... no... please don't kill me.
Don't kill me.

743
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,979
I'm not God to forgive you!

744
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:40,850
15 long years I've been searching
day in and night out for her,

745
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:45,426
I spent sleepless and endlessly
searching for her, she's my sister.

746
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:55,432
I swear on my sister,
let it be anyone who crosses her path,

747
01:07:55,638 --> 01:08:01,702
I'm God of death to them.
I'll take any number of lives for her.

01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:03,433
Thank God, you saved her.

752
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,440
You're here as God's boon.

753
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:12,171
If anything had happened to Aishwarya,
I would be responsible for it.

754
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:17,943
I'm not a boon in her life,
I'm a curse to her.

755
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:21,256
I'm responsible for her difficulties.

756

I'm responsible for her tears.

01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:31,789
The man who she hates to the core,
her brother,

758
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,026
it's none other than me.

759
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:45,472
Got rid of the goon!

760
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,546
We can live peacefully now.
He's dead.

761
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:55,686
- Is it Deepavali today?
- No dear.

762
01:09:55,891 --> 01:10:00,851
- Why are they bursting crackers then?
- Our father died!

763
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:03,221
People cry on death, right?

764
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:06,993
Our father made everyone cry
while alive, that's why.

765
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,329
Lorry is best for him.

766
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:09,265
What are you looking at?

767
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:11,905
- Father.
- It's sin to touch your father's body.

768
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:13,665
This is the end for all
the unjust people.

769
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:14,570
Go away!

770
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:16,871
Father!

771
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:23,979
I'm hungry, brother.

772
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:28,587
Good riddance! We can live peacefully.

773
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:32,750
Please give me some food,
my sister is hungry.

774
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:36,489
Look, who is here!
To plunder people like his father.

775
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:39,429
Go away!

776
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:41,967
Annachi, please give two idlies
for my sister.

777
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:44,105
- Go away.
- I'll do any work for you.

778
01:10:44,306 --> 01:10:47,173
You'll request now, but demand
after growing up like your father.

779
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:48,604
Go die!

780
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:51,109
Don't know how many lives
would he take after growing up?

781
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:53,076
Bloody goon's son!

782
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:54,613
Brother!

783
01:10:56,452 --> 01:11:00,115
No, please don't ask help
from anyone, brother.

784
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:03,621
I don't want food, I'm not hungry.

785
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:10,026
Let's die without food, brother.

786
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:18,870
Stay here, I'll come back in a minute.

787
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:21,565
- Come back, brother.
- I'll come.

788
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:23,904
- Promise!
- Promise.

789
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:26,539
Where did you steal it?

790
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:28,546
I didn't steal it,
that's my sister's ring.

791
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:30,082
Tell that to police.

792
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:36,588
I left no one with a request for help
to buy food for my sister.

793
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:40,819
Where ever I went I was chased out
branding me as goon's son.

794
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:44,488
Nobody has come for you,
please come with us.

795
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,100
We'll send you to school
and educate you.

796
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:50,500
I'll not come,
my brother will come with food.

797
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:53,106
He hasn't yet come, dear.

798
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:56,767
Boy, be careful.
Get up.

799
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:00,506
You'll get good clothes to wear.
We'll feed you with good food.

800
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:02,081
We'll give you toys too.

801
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,780
- Who are they?
- Christian Missionaries.

802
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:11,482
They give shelter to the girls
found on streets.

803
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:14,492
- Will they feed her?
- They will.

804
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:18,030
- Will they feed her thrice a day?
- They will.

805
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:21,259
- Will they look after her well?
- They will.

806
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:24,633
Brother... my brother has come.

807
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,138
They're asking me to come with them.

808
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:31,369
Is she your sister?

809
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:41,012
She's not my sister.

810
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:47,787
I found her on streets, I showed pity
and she's after me calling as brother.

811
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:53,029
Take her with you, sir.

812
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:55,328
Why are you saying like this, brother?

813
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:58,830
I'm your sister, am I not?

814
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,408
I don't know who you are,
she's a torture.

815
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:05,671
Take her with you, sir.

816
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:20,755
Brother... brother...

817
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:34,501
Ever since that day I went to the
orphanage to see my sister.

818
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:39,545
He's coming here to meet you
for the past 2 months,

819
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:44,776
- Is he telling the truth?
- No, I don't know who he is!

820
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,549
I don't have any brother!

821
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:50,716
I'm an orphan.

822
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:53,655
I don't have anyone.

823
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:57,093
Tell him to go away,
I don't have anyone.

824
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:02,970
I don't have anyone.

825
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:09,073
I was happy watching my sister
from far away.

826
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:13,908
Suddenly one day I came to know
someone was adopting my sister.

827
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,811
I got shocked and went for her.

828
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:20,810
Eat...

829
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:30,294
Though I was her brother,
I couldn't provide her a morsel of food,

830
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:33,297
but God gave her parents and a home,

831
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:37,666
I'm still feeling sad for that one lie.

care of everything.

What's this both of them
are going together?

835
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:59,856
Have they come closer?
Is she still after him?

836
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,690
Are you fine? How are your parents?
Are they doing fine?

837
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,868
Who is he? New to the area.

838
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:12,472
Uncle, his sister is not well,
we came to offer prayers.

839
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:16,610
If you offer nine food grains to Goddess,
all your prayers will be answered.

840
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:18,871
You'll be fine, take the offering.

841
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:24,941
It's between that six feet or
this five feet, let me see it.

842
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:28,252
Take the offering.

843
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,681
You said to donate nine food grains
for speedy recovery of sick,

844
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:32,986
is there anything for the
union of a girl and boy?

845
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:34,355
There is!

846
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:37,123
Do a flower dedication,
the girl will walk to you.

847
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:38,458
Do it for me immediately, priest.

848
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,396
Come, let's fulfill your vow.

849
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:44,768
Why are they standing here?

850
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:47,032
They're standing here to take
the flowers falling on you.

851
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:48,004
Oh offering!

852
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,734
- Can I start fulfilling the vow?
- Sure.

853
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:53,005
Close your eyes and make a sincere wish.

854
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:55,311
Make a wish!

855
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,583
- Hail Goddess Kali!
- Paru...

856
01:15:58,987 --> 01:15:59,715
Hail Goddess Kali!

You're for me only... for me only!

01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,464
You'll get the girl you desire.

864
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:51,802
Hail Goddess!

865
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:53,673
Hail Goddess Kali!

866
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:56,366
This basket is over, get that basket.

867
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:00,744
Your vow is fulfilled,
you co-operated very well.

868
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:04,715
If your wish remains unfulfilled,
there's another vow flower bed.

869
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:09,116
Look there, that's flower bed.

870
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:12,225
If you sleep on the flower bed
facing down,

871
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:16,420
these devotees will run over you
with great devotion.

872
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:19,258
I'll start it myself.

873
01:17:19,534 --> 01:17:22,765
- Your wish will get fulfilled.
- It'll get torn!

874
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:26,006
We've fulfilled the vow, good will happen.

875
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:40,011
We've got no auto's.

AYNGARAN DVD

877
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:00,653
Who are these guys?

878
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:15,575
- Who is it?
- It's me.

879
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,679
Sir, new Inspector arrested our men.

880
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:20,813
Call him to the dinner.

881
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:23,951
I came honouring your invitation,
but law must do it's duty, right?

882
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:26,450
Eat! Boys, hold him.

883
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:38,959
Running kangaroo courts, grabbing lands,
murders and kidnappings in Tuticorin,

884
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:42,398
Easwaramurthy who is breaking
law and order,

885
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:47,564
Police Commissioner Shanmughanathan
issued a shoot at sight order on him.

886
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:49,471
Greetings Shanmughanathan!

887
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:52,306
- No please.
- Please sit.

888
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:54,345
Family tour?
Please sit.

889
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:55,015
Would you like to have an ice cream?

890
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:56,206
No mood, dad.

891
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:04,489
You issued an order on
white paper to kill me.

892
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:08,823
But the power of who must live and who
must die rests with people like me, right?

893
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:13,096
I'm giving you two chances,
one, I'll shoot you with this,

894
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:17,635
but this damn gun never stops
with one bullet,

895
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:27,072
second chance, shoot yourself with your gun,

896
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:28,840
if you do like that,

897
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,711
- come son,
- Dad!

898
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:32,546
I swear on my son,

899
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:35,655
I'll not touch your wife or children,

900
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:38,317
you're failing to understand
the seriousness of it,

901
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:50,598
Children! Shall we all play together?

902
01:21:50,805 --> 01:21:53,330
Don't think and take a good decision.

AYNGARAN DVD

904
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:17,695
- What's it hubby?
- Nothing.

905
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:20,594
Be careful!

906
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:31,041
We needn't have to kill everyone,
fear for us will kill them.

907
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:33,537
Obama of Tuticorin!

908
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:35,579
Benefactor of Tuticorin!

909
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:39,948
Hail our great leader!

910
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:41,349
Friend of the poor!
Greetings.

911
01:22:41,556 --> 01:22:43,717
Doctorate degrees have lost the value.

912
01:22:44,192 --> 01:22:46,490
I said undeserved people
are getting it, that's why.

913
01:22:47,996 --> 01:22:49,861
I'm sparing you because
you're my brother-in-law.

914
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:52,590
- Collector is waiting for you, sir.
- Okay... okay.

915
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:53,697
Getting late, go.

916
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:54,561
What?

917
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:57,067
I can hear songs from it,
isn't it hearing aid?

918
01:22:57,272 --> 01:23:00,764
No, whatever he says is disgusting,
I can't take it.

919
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:03,171
So, I listen to songs to pacify myself.

920
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:05,539
He too knows about this.
That's my fate!

921
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:07,374
Don't raise slogans,
meeting has started.

922
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:08,207
Go to the hall.

923
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:11,078
Press men please enter from B gate.
Don't park two wheelers here.

924
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:13,220
Remove the vehicle. Go... go...

925
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:14,786
You were trying for transfer, got it?

926
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,356
No, still trying for it.

927
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:20,721
- What?
- You look voluminous!

928
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:23,454
How could I miss you all these days?

929
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:26,130
Come with me I say!

930
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:30,464
There may be many who were
honoured with doctorates,

931
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,436
but today a doctorate
has been honoured by,

932
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:35,575
a man who is friend of
the poor and needy,

933
01:23:35,777 --> 01:23:37,301
a protector of women,

934
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:39,810
a sea of benevolence...

935
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,539
All of you would get ruined!

936
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,377
Who will come to ruin us?

937
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:45,177
I'm Prabhakaran.

938
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:48,083
I'm Easwaramurthy.

939
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:52,316
- Are you the new ASP?
- Yes.

940
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:54,222
It seems you're checking my lorries.

941
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:57,057
Don't check, my boys are tensed.

942
01:23:57,265 --> 01:24:01,031
Be careful, next time brakes
of my lorries may fail.

943
01:24:01,236 --> 01:24:02,703
I can't answer my higher officers.

944
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:05,998
- Check 5 lorries peripherally.
- Okay.

945
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:08,971
- Check all the lorries peripherally.
- Okay sir.

946
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:11,577
You've caught it easily like fire.

947
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:21,285
Sir, I've checked the lorries peripherally

948
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:22,581
Did you check properly?

949
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:23,849
Everything is ready.

950
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:26,052
Then blast it!

952
01:24:55,156 --> 01:24:56,748
Are you mad? Mental!

953
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,721
Just checked peripherally as you said.

954
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,896
If I had checked inside I would've
known about the bombs.

955
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:05,456
I think you said 5 lorries...

956
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:10,565
Now the count is correct.

957
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:13,965
How is the live telecast
of the bomb blast?

958
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:17,606
Tuticorin is my fort,
this is my kingdom,

959
01:25:17,812 --> 01:25:19,074
I'll make you remove the uniform.

960
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,942
Do it fast, if I wear uniform,
I'm obliged to shoot below the knees.

961
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:24,618
If not I can shoot where ever I want to.

962
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:26,309
How will it suit you?

963
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,961
He's not encounter specialist
but blast specialist.

964
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:46,371
Brother!

965
01:25:57,185 --> 01:26:00,348
Sir, everyone is after me
branding as goon's son.

966
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:03,922
I'm scared I would end up as a goon.

967
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,687
I want to become
a police officer like you sir.

968
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:15,629
Don't worry, I'll educate you.

969
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:19,531
You started the war, I'll finish it.

970
01:26:20,408 --> 01:26:21,841
- Who is he?
- Name is Prabhakaran.

971
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:24,978
IPS, till date 48 encounters
to his credit,

972
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,545

973

Put and asphyxiate him.

1007

What are you looking at?
Hack him to death!

1008
01:30:21,315 --> 01:30:22,942
I don't care about life.

1009
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:30,620
I don't have anyone in this
world to worry about me.

1010
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:31,689
No commitments.

1011
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:34,828
It seems you've many commitments,

1012
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:36,963
it seems you grab land from
anyone in this place.

1013
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:39,224
It seems you're asking a share
in anyone doing business here.

1014
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:40,799
Why are you so avaricious?

1015

All you've is just one son.

01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:45,238
You love your son very much, right?

1017
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,566
Raja Pandi?

1018
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:48,672
Caught like fire!

1019
01:30:48,876 --> 01:30:49,900
Where is my son Raja Pandi?

1020
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:52,306
- He went to the harbour.
- Bloody...

1021
01:30:57,952 --> 01:30:59,920
- Raja Pandi?
- No.

1022
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:01,918
This is your number, right?

1023
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:05,092
Number is correct but member is wrong.

1024
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,019
Brother-in-law, he's having the phone.

1025
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:10,196
Then, is Raja Pandi in your custody?

1026
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:12,929
Not in my custody, but as my guest.

1027
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:15,033
Don't harm my son.

1028
01:31:16,971 --> 01:31:19,269

Find Raja Pandi.

- You fool!
- You told us to sing now, right?

1034
01:31:46,434 --> 01:31:47,401
I told you to find him.

1035
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:52,969

Everything I do is against law.

1037
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:59,476
I'm not ordinary man to file
an FIR on me.

1038
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:03,639
I'm Easwaramurthy's son Raja Pandi.

1039
01:32:04,685 --> 01:32:05,481
Pick up the phone.

1040
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:07,483
- You've to salute your officers, right?
- Hello!

1041
01:32:08,856 --> 01:32:09,550
Okay.

1042
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:12,323
Open his cell.

1043
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:16,156
Isn't it shattering on hearing it?
Open it!

1044
01:32:16,998 --> 01:32:24,495
Right from this bench, phone to court,
our writ rules the roost.

1045
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:28,436
Your IPS has limits,
we don't have any limits.

1046
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:38,014
I'm hungry, get me a biryani.

1047
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:47,190
She's the VIP who called me just now.

1048
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:48,362
Take care of him, please.

AYNGARAN DVD

1050
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:06,035
Take good care of me,
all of you close your eyes.

1051
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:08,909
Madam is going to take care of me.

1052
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:10,982
Serve!

1053
01:33:21,028 --> 01:33:22,393
Not so hot!

1054
01:33:25,032 --> 01:33:26,397
Salt is less.

1055
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:37,407
Enough sir?

1056
01:33:37,678 --> 01:33:39,908
- Not enough, serve some more.
- Take it, Selvi.

1057
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:48,251
Gravy is not that spicy,
add little pepper.

1058
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:01,101
You've made a grave mistake.

1059
01:34:01,802 --> 01:34:04,430
Now you've dared to beat me,
you'll face the heat later.

1060
01:34:04,972 --> 01:34:07,770
Are you beating me with a plan?
I'll not spare you.

1061
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:10,603
He's from powerful family,
let's release him, sir.

1062
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:12,779
Are you scared?

1063
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:19,309
Police should never get scared,
those who get scared mustn'tjoin police.

1064
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:24,523
Police isn'tjust an officer
marching past in parade,

1065
01:34:25,092 --> 01:34:27,458
he's one who knows which is right
and which is wrong,

1066
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:30,187
he's wrong,
I'm right!

1067
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:33,299
I don't follow IPC for such crooks,

1068
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:37,126
I follow PPC, Prabhakaran Penal Code.

1069
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:44,308
Who? Who dared to arrest our boss?

1070
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:47,072
- Don't leave anyone.
- Isn't it you?

1071
01:34:47,281 --> 01:34:49,806
It's you, right? Are you so arrogant?

1072
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:51,143
Do you know who you're up against?

1073
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:52,478
Why are you staring at me?

1074
01:35:01,295 --> 01:35:02,091
Leave me... leave me...

1075
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:10,663
I'll not say it again.

1076
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:13,833
I'll tell taking promise
from my father.

1077
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:20,604
Brother-in-law, let's see in that ward.

1078
01:35:24,885 --> 01:35:27,683
Look, how my son has been
left like an orphan here.

1079
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:31,183
Sir!

1080
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:33,353
What are you doing here?
Where is my son Raja Pandi?

1081
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:36,029
I don't know sir.
I'm taking rest, sir.

1082
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:39,461
- Rest?
- Sir, Raja Pandi is here.

1083
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:42,202
Don't worry sir, father is here.

1084
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:45,368
Sir, look at the plight of our Raja sir.

1085
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:48,371
My son has been made
to sleep on ground.

1086
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:50,942
- What a pitiable plight!
- What happened son?

1087
01:35:52,012 --> 01:35:53,604
It's paining, dad.

1088
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:59,781
He locked me up in cell
and let a woman beat me.

1089
01:36:05,926 --> 01:36:07,894
Everyone who leaves this orphanage,

1090
01:36:08,262 --> 01:36:13,825
call me on their birthday
to seek my blessings.

1091
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:18,565
But your sister never contacted me
after changing the place.

1092
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:20,741
You're also coming here
without fail for her.

1093
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:22,067
But no information.

1094
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:26,007
I think it could be the hatred
she has for you.

1095
01:36:26,847 --> 01:36:31,147
I think she's stubborn in not
meeting you at any cost.

01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:53,606
Come.

1099
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:55,609
Come.

1100
01:37:03,317 --> 01:37:05,285
How dare you beat my son!

1101
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:13,450
The humiliation you'll meet now will
instill fear in everyone till death.

1102
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:18,128
Not only me, everyone must fear
my son or grandson too.

1103
01:37:18,332 --> 01:37:22,894
Yes, those who beat are
indeed fearsome.

1104
01:37:23,504 --> 01:37:26,871
Yes, if the criminal is powerful,
we'll not dare ask him,

1105
01:37:27,575 --> 01:37:32,638
we'll salute him,
now, it's not like that, you crook!

Bloody bastard!
Were you born to one father,

1108
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:01,504
show your power, arrogance
and manliness with him.

1109
01:38:09,617 --> 01:38:11,949
Are you so arrogant?

1110
01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:15,116
Break your arrogance yourself,
else I'll do it for you.

1111
01:38:15,656 --> 01:38:19,524
I'm warning you,
you're committing a mistake.

1112
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:22,021
Trying to scare me.

1113
01:38:22,229 --> 01:38:23,856
Do what so ever you may,
I'll not get scared.

1114
01:38:24,064 --> 01:38:26,862
I've realised quite early,
what's good and what's bad in life.

1115
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:32,471
But one thing I've never known,
I've never known what fear is!

1116
01:38:32,873 --> 01:38:36,104
It seems you scare everyone,
come on, dare to scare me.

1117
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:38,568
Come on do it I say!

1118
01:38:39,647 --> 01:38:41,877
Why are you backing off
after boasting to scare me?

1119
01:38:42,082 --> 01:38:45,381
I'll get you transferred in 2 days.

1120
01:38:46,186 --> 01:38:48,051
Already the department has
given up on me.

1121
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:50,890
I'm going to every place in
search of men like you.

1122
01:38:51,859 --> 01:38:55,226
My transfer order, before I leave
this place, I'll play with you.

1123
01:38:55,930 --> 01:39:00,560
Are you my wife or concubine
to be with you all my life?

1124
01:39:02,136 --> 01:39:04,730
Your story ends here.

1125
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:15,348
You scared the day lights
of these people here,

1126
01:39:15,549 --> 01:39:17,517
I'll show what fear is to you!

1127
01:39:18,385 --> 01:39:21,081
Watch, how you'll shiver in 10 minutes.

1128
01:39:21,689 --> 01:39:23,418
Just watch how meekly you'll surrender.

1129
01:39:28,529 --> 01:39:30,497
- Go man!
- I'll take you to task.

1130
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:33,433
When are you getting transferred?

1131
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:36,102
It's just an empty cover.

1132
01:39:44,912 --> 01:39:47,847
Will he scare me? In 10 minutes?

1133
01:39:49,149 --> 01:39:50,377
How is he going to scare me?

1134
01:39:50,584 --> 01:39:53,109
Are you a kid to fear on seeing darkness?

1135
01:39:56,323 --> 01:39:56,948
Son!

1136
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:02,128
Hello!

1137
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:04,627
Son! You're in hospital, right?

1138
01:40:05,332 --> 01:40:08,392
No, I'm having a ball with
foreign girl in pub.

1139
01:40:08,602 --> 01:40:09,296
Pub?

1140
01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:12,301
I'm not a girl like that.

1141
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:14,065
Why did you go to the pub?

1142
01:40:14,274 --> 01:40:17,732
You saw my plight, right?
Why are you asking if I'm in hospital?

1143
01:40:17,945 --> 01:40:20,812
No, just to inquire about your health.

1144
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:22,812
Why are you tensed, dad?

1145
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:27,818
Tensed? Me? No way.
Nothing, take care of your health.

1146
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:29,421
- Okay dad.
- Okay.

1147
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:35,328
Hello!

1148
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:36,496
Just 5 more minutes only.

1149
01:40:41,935 --> 01:40:43,732
Who the hell is he to set time for me?

1150
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:49,001
Why are you sweating?

1151
01:40:49,209 --> 01:40:50,574
You too are sweating.

1152
01:40:56,316 --> 01:40:58,841
How does this fear start?

1153
01:40:59,053 --> 01:41:01,419
It starts with the doubt how it starts.

1154
01:41:04,792 --> 01:41:06,521
Just one more minute only.

1155
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:07,692
One more minute only!

1156
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:09,760
Don't raise my tension saying time.

1157
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:17,127
Sir, they're fumigating for mosquitoes.

1158
01:41:20,941 --> 01:41:23,705
- Switch on the AC.
- It's already running, sir.

1159
01:41:27,214 --> 01:41:28,647
Just 5 seconds only.

1160
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:39,059
What happened?

1161
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:41,220
Who was that?
Who is it?

1162
01:41:41,428 --> 01:41:44,158
He talked about fear and
broke the glass like a kid.

1163
01:41:44,364 --> 01:41:48,232
No, he did something.
He did something to me.

1164
01:41:55,275 --> 01:41:55,741
Phone!

1165
01:41:57,211 --> 01:41:57,836
Hello!

1166
01:42:01,181 --> 01:42:04,673
You're the first man to listen
to your own funeral band.

1167
01:42:05,285 --> 01:42:06,752
Bloody bugger!

1168
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:08,080
What did you do to me?

1169
01:42:08,288 --> 01:42:11,689
You must die slowly,
I've given you a poison injection.

1170
01:42:12,059 --> 01:42:13,993
- Slow poison!
- Slow?

1171
01:42:14,294 --> 01:42:17,786
In about 12 hours,
it'll spread all over your body,

1172
01:42:18,298 --> 01:42:22,428
each part of it will get damaged,
after that death!

1173
01:42:22,636 --> 01:42:24,194
City will celebrate bursting crackers!

1174
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:27,601
If you do as I order you,

1175
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:31,376
I'll give the anti-dote for the poison.

1176
01:42:31,578 --> 01:42:33,603
I'll die rather than do
anything you order me.

1177
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:36,681
You'll die if you don't.
You're talking silly.

1178
01:42:37,518 --> 01:42:38,280
Rascal!

1179
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:40,953
Tell me quickly, what should I do now?

1180
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:42,281
I'll call again to tell you.

Tell me doctor.

- No.

Thank you very much, doctor.

You've brightened my life,

Who are you? What do you want?
Why are you tensed?

You've come to me, right?

Cool, you've come to me,
I'll solve your problems in a second.

1193
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:25,756
Please sit down.

1194
01:43:25,966 --> 01:43:27,490
Doctor, they gave me a shot of injection.

1195
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:29,601
What injection?
Which doctor gave it?

1196
01:43:29,803 --> 01:43:30,929
Not a doctor but a police officer.

1197
01:43:31,138 --> 01:43:33,504
Police? They do only encounters, right?

1198
01:43:33,707 --> 01:43:37,336
Doctor, I can't explain in detail now.
My body is feeling strange.

1199
01:43:37,544 --> 01:43:39,512
First, we must take a blood test, right?

1200
01:43:39,813 --> 01:43:43,180
Because injection was
given by an IPS not MBBS.

1201
01:43:43,984 --> 01:43:44,916
Nurse!

1202
01:43:47,487 --> 01:43:50,115
Excuse me, I'm Seemachu
alias Sreenivasan,

1203
01:43:50,490 --> 01:43:52,890
why are you tensed?
She's very nice doctor.

01:43:54,261 --> 01:43:57,355
- Your blood group is O positive.
- Mine is also O positive.

1205
01:43:58,065 --> 01:43:59,862
What doctor? Mine is also O positive.

1206
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:02,627
I don't have children,
he too has no children.

1207
01:44:02,836 --> 01:44:05,361
He already has a child, he's 27 now.

1208
01:44:05,572 --> 01:44:08,973
Super sir! How did you have the child sir?
Sir, please tell me the technique.

1209
01:44:09,176 --> 01:44:10,643
Take care of him.

1210
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:13,774
Isn't it wrong?

1211
01:44:13,981 --> 01:44:17,144
Don't stretch things,
make it short and sweet.

1212
01:44:17,351 --> 01:44:18,943
Tell him to remove the sickle.

1213
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:21,152
Thank you.

1214
01:44:23,523 --> 01:44:27,050
- I've used all my experience
to find one thing, - Tell me.

1215
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:31,557
Someone has injected
deadly poison into you.

1216
01:44:32,699 --> 01:44:35,065
I too know that, tell me the remedy.

1217
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:36,736
I'll tell you what you shouldn't do.

1218
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:39,402
Don't get angry.
You shouldn't hit like that.

1219
01:44:39,673 --> 01:44:41,732
- Shouldn't bang like that.
- Tell me what should I do.

1220
01:44:41,942 --> 01:44:44,570
- Very simple, I'll give an anti-dote.
- Give me quickly.

1221
01:44:44,778 --> 01:44:47,076
- Don't rush.
- Please hold him.

1222
01:44:47,681 --> 01:44:49,672
Not him. Hold the man who gave him
the shot of injection.

1223
01:44:49,883 --> 01:44:51,646
I can give the anti-dote only
on knowing the combination.

1224
01:44:51,852 --> 01:44:55,583
- He'll not reveal.
- Then, he'll die in 11 hours.

1225
01:44:55,789 --> 01:44:57,086
He said 12 hours.

1226
01:44:57,291 --> 01:45:02,422
Nurse, see! You all say I'm a big bore.

1227
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:05,097
But he didn't know how much
time he has spent with me.

1228
01:45:05,465 --> 01:45:07,262
One hour passed away just like this.

1229
01:45:07,467 --> 01:45:09,435
Save me please!

1230
01:45:09,636 --> 01:45:12,833
For every hour 200 ml of your
blood is getting spoilt.

1231
01:45:13,974 --> 01:45:18,274
If 200 ml fresh blood is transfused
to every hour, you'll survive.

1232
01:45:18,478 --> 01:45:21,106
Make your arrangements
for transfusing blood.

1233
01:45:21,315 --> 01:45:24,113
Where can I get a man
with O positive blood now?

1234
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:26,013
Mine is O positive, right?

1235
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:32,788
Why?

1236
01:45:38,665 --> 01:45:40,792
I'm feeling giddy, give me blood.

1237
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:41,968
Blood ready.

1238
01:45:42,336 --> 01:45:46,796
Give him juice continuously.
Blood will be ready in one hour.

1239
01:45:49,242 --> 01:45:52,700
Hello, I'm Radha Jayachandran.
MBBS, FRCS.

1240
01:45:52,913 --> 01:45:55,211
There's an idiot there, give him the phone.

1241
01:45:55,415 --> 01:45:57,144
- Who is idiot here?
- Sir.

1242
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:58,909
He's talking about sir, you talk to him.

1243
01:46:00,253 --> 01:46:01,311
Your name is Easwaramurthy, right?

1244
01:46:01,521 --> 01:46:03,148
He's losing life, name doesn't matter.

1245
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:08,158
Give me the phone.
Tell me what should I do?

1246
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:10,330
The voice that ruled has
started making pleas.

1247
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:11,827
What should I do now?

1248
01:46:12,532 --> 01:46:13,658
Go to Sathya Fish Market.

1249
01:46:13,867 --> 01:46:19,499
Take exact money that you collected
from the day one as protection money.

1250
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:23,837
Their hard earned money must
reach them in one hour.

1251
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:29,175
In one hour...
how can I distribute it in one hour?

1252
01:46:29,883 --> 01:46:33,614
I want to give you time, but you
don't have that much time, right?

1253
01:46:33,987 --> 01:46:46,627
AYNGARAN DVD

1254
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,025
This way is short cut to Sathya market.

1255
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:51,204
No, you've to go around
the burial ground.

1256
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:53,532
Shut up, my house is this side,
I can get down.

1257
01:46:59,846 --> 01:47:01,871
- I don't understand anything.
- Treatment.

1258
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:03,041
What treatment?

1259
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:04,376
Treating poison with poison.

1260
01:47:05,552 --> 01:47:10,148
He hasn't yet called, I've given
the money, no call yet.

1261
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:11,220
- Stop!
- Why?

1262
01:47:11,425 --> 01:47:13,655
Normally a cigar will reduce
5 minutes of life.

1263
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:14,554
But for you it's 60 minutes.

1264
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:16,729
I've been watching you,
you're doing too much.

1265
01:47:17,164 --> 01:47:18,893
I'm innocent to look but
terror if I get angry.

1266
01:47:19,099 --> 01:47:20,896
- Throw it.
- A volcano.

1267
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:23,893
Hello!

1268
01:47:25,038 --> 01:47:27,836
- Give the phone to the crook.
- Crook? Who is it?

1269
01:47:28,175 --> 01:47:29,073
Give... give...

1270
01:47:29,276 --> 01:47:31,506
Little earlier he said idiot,
now he says crook.

1271
01:47:31,711 --> 01:47:33,975
Crook is better than idiot,
fix that one only.

1272
01:47:34,948 --> 01:47:36,176
What should I do now?

1273
01:47:36,483 --> 01:47:38,246
Go to VOC street.

1274
01:47:40,387 --> 01:47:44,084
You started grabbing land from an old man
there to become land shark.

1275
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:47,488
Return his documents and money.

1276
01:47:47,861 --> 01:47:50,694
Don't harm me, I don't have anything.

1277
01:47:50,897 --> 01:47:53,593
No old man, I'm here to give
not to take from you.

1278
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:56,428
- Take your documents.
- I'm scared.

1279
01:47:56,636 --> 01:47:59,764
- I'm more scared than you.
- Please take it.

1280
01:48:00,307 --> 01:48:02,104
- Give the money to him.
- Sir! Take it.

1281
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:04,277
May God bless you long life!

1282
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:07,379
Good blessing but he doesn't
have that much time.

1283
01:48:07,581 --> 01:48:08,775
Just few hours only.

1284
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:10,950
Beyond that his life depends
on the phone caller.

1285
01:48:11,151 --> 01:48:14,279
Yes, please inform him that
you got back your land.

1286
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:17,389
- Tell him, don't forget.
- Do you've to hug him for that?

1287
01:48:17,657 --> 01:48:18,453
Take the vehicle.

1288
01:48:28,835 --> 01:48:30,632
Enough, come brother-in-law.

1289
01:48:34,007 --> 01:48:36,976
Where's next operation? Singapore?

1290
01:48:37,811 --> 01:48:39,301
Singaravelar University?

1291
01:48:39,779 --> 01:48:42,646
- He can't study now.
- Tell him to go via harbour.

1292
01:48:42,849 --> 01:48:43,474
Why?

1293
01:48:43,683 --> 01:48:45,810
Ever since I came here on transfer,
I didn't see harbour.

1294
01:48:46,019 --> 01:48:48,146
You want to fulfill all your wishes
before he dies.

1295
01:48:48,522 --> 01:48:52,891
Can we go via harbour?
This hand!

1296
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:55,154
Kill me, that's better than this hell.

1297
01:48:55,362 --> 01:48:56,488
Good idea though it's late.

1298
01:48:56,696 --> 01:48:58,994
It's inauspicious time,
if you die now, you can go to hell.

1299
01:48:59,799 --> 01:49:02,165
You're in for bad time now.

1300
01:49:02,369 --> 01:49:03,836
What should I do now?

1301
01:49:04,037 --> 01:49:07,097
- Aren't you Dr. Easwaramurthy?
- Yes.

1302
01:49:07,307 --> 01:49:09,901
Why do you need another doctor?
Treat yourself.

1303
01:49:11,044 --> 01:49:13,069
It's just a doctorate degree!

1304
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:17,341
I don't like it, return it.
Don't think.

1305
01:49:17,717 --> 01:49:20,311
Go to university,
tell them you're a crook,

1306
01:49:20,687 --> 01:49:23,679
and don't have any qualification
for getting the degree.

1307
01:49:24,491 --> 01:49:26,186
- Take it back.
- I don't get it.

1308
01:49:26,626 --> 01:49:31,529
I'm a crook, I don't deserve
a doctorate degree. Keep it.

1309
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:36,133
I heard you, doctor degree has
got back it's honour.

1310
01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:37,529
You're my brother-in-law.

1311
01:49:47,747 --> 01:49:48,714
My nose is bleeding.

1312
01:49:48,915 --> 01:49:51,782
Don't get tensed,
first it'll start from one hole,

1313
01:49:52,085 --> 01:49:54,315
later on you'll bleed from
all nine holes in the body.

1314
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:55,646
Where's the band aid?

1315
01:49:55,855 --> 01:49:57,948
My house is very near,
can I get it?

1316
01:49:58,191 --> 01:50:01,217
Will you come back?
Don't play such silly games.

1317
01:50:01,428 --> 01:50:03,225
Who will donate blood to him then?

1318
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:05,057
- It's in the packet, right?
- I want fresh blood from body.

1319
01:50:05,265 --> 01:50:08,826
- Very loyal.
- I'm dying with body pain.

1320
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:15,730
Hello... lt's my wife Krithika...

1321
01:50:15,942 --> 01:50:17,910
- Doctor, I'm feeling giddy.
- It'll stop, don't worry.

1322
01:50:18,111 --> 01:50:19,408
- When?
- As soon as you die.

1323
01:50:20,113 --> 01:50:22,411
How much should I drink?
I think I'll die drinking juice.

1324
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:25,414
- You'll die even if you don't drink.
- Then, am I sure to die?

1325
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:28,019
Yes, there's not much gap
between you both.

1326
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:32,816
Two deaths in one injection will be
a great achievement in my career.

1327
01:50:33,059 --> 01:50:36,085
Thank you... thanks... Lord Thiruchitrambalam.

1328
01:50:37,197 --> 01:50:39,495
This time he's calling you directly.
Talk to him.

1329
01:50:41,334 --> 01:50:44,770
Go to Karunya Ashrama and
return the guest house you raised there.

1330
01:50:45,739 --> 01:50:48,435
- Take back the land I bought from you.
- No, you robbed it.

1331
01:50:49,476 --> 01:50:52,604
- I can't believe it.
- I too can't believe it.

1332
01:50:52,812 --> 01:50:54,939
- Very happy.
- We too are very happy.

1333
01:50:58,985 --> 01:51:00,612
- TV media people!
- Move away!

1334
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:02,617
Why should I?
I'm his blood brother.

1335
01:51:02,822 --> 01:51:03,618
When did you become my brother?

1336
01:51:03,823 --> 01:51:06,451
I'm giving you my blood
in installments.

1337
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:09,959
All of you please go back, give him
some air, he's about to die.

1338
01:51:10,163 --> 01:51:13,462
- You can his photos then.
- Take my photos, I'm his brother.

1339
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:15,134
Why did you suddenly start this social work?

1340
01:51:15,335 --> 01:51:16,802
You don't worry, I'll answer.

1341
01:51:17,237 --> 01:51:20,229
He's doing the social work
because he says.

1342
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:22,635
- Who is he?
- God... God...

1343
01:51:22,842 --> 01:51:23,809
Are you planing to enter politics?

1344
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:24,806
- He'll not come.
- Why?

1345
01:51:25,011 --> 01:51:26,979
- He doesn't have that much time.
- There's lot of time for elections.

1346
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:30,308
But his countdown has started.
He'll die in few hours from now.

1347
01:51:30,517 --> 01:51:33,145
He'll lose deposit...
we'll know his capacity,

1348
01:51:33,353 --> 01:51:35,150
anyway be ready with wreaths.

1349
01:51:35,855 --> 01:51:37,652
- One more question.
- No questions.

1350
01:51:38,124 --> 01:51:40,354
- You didn't answer my question, sir.
- Hello!

1351
01:51:41,394 --> 01:51:42,884
Madhavapuram Shiva temple?

1352
01:51:47,033 --> 01:51:48,660
Go... go... don't push...

1353
01:51:56,209 --> 01:51:58,177
Free food is being distributed there.

1354
01:51:58,378 --> 01:51:59,345
I'm going... going...

1355
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:02,674
- We too...
- No, he's going towards liberation.

1356
01:52:06,986 --> 01:52:07,748
Did you see?

1357
01:52:09,222 --> 01:52:10,018
Take it dear.

1358
01:52:11,891 --> 01:52:15,190
- I have seen.
- Fall at her feet and seek forgiveness.

1359
01:52:15,462 --> 01:52:21,059
Sister, please forgive me.
You must save my life.

1360
01:52:21,401 --> 01:52:25,929
Say you've forgiven me.
My life hinges on your words.

1361
01:52:26,406 --> 01:52:36,213
Show mercy please O Goddess!
Please say you've forgiven me.

1362
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:44,485
My grandma used to say candle will
give more light before dying.

1363
01:52:45,258 --> 01:52:47,783
Now I know she was right.

1364
01:52:48,194 --> 01:52:50,890
How many lives you've brightened
before your death?

1365
01:52:51,097 --> 01:52:54,066
- Doctor, I'll finish you.
- Let me see, lift your hand.

1366
01:52:55,935 --> 01:52:58,403
You can't lift your hand,
what can you do to me?

1367
01:52:59,105 --> 01:53:03,235
All mobiles are waiting,
don't know which cell will ring now?

1368
01:53:04,444 --> 01:53:07,413
I was treating patients happily
in the AC comforts,

1369
01:53:07,614 --> 01:53:10,242
I'm sitting in the middle of road
at noon because of you.

1370
01:53:11,351 --> 01:53:13,478
Your men don't have any affection on you.

1371
01:53:13,686 --> 01:53:17,747
They're watching you die as if
watching a 20-20 match on TV.

1372
01:53:18,124 --> 01:53:19,489
I've to go to Vivekananda nagar.
How much?

1373
01:53:19,692 --> 01:53:21,922
- Rs.150.
- Too much. It's Rs.100 only, right?

1374
01:53:22,128 --> 01:53:23,254
Rs.150 only!

1375
01:53:24,697 --> 01:53:27,097
Still it'll be Rs.100 only,
I can give Rs.100 only.

1376
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:28,426
I'll ply if you give Rs.150.

1377
01:53:33,973 --> 01:53:35,600
Fighting for few rupees even
on the verge of death,

1378
01:53:35,809 --> 01:53:37,606
you've reduced your life to paltry Rs.50!

1379
01:53:37,811 --> 01:53:39,779
Drink the free juice.

1380
01:53:43,216 --> 01:53:44,444
- Hello!
- Who is it?

1381
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:45,443
My husband.

1382
01:53:45,652 --> 01:53:48,621
Tell me dear, asking me
when will I be back in home?

1383
01:53:49,322 --> 01:53:51,381
How many hours have passed
since you got injected?

1384
01:53:51,591 --> 01:53:54,116
11 hours.
- Then, I'll be in home in an hour.

1385
01:53:54,327 --> 01:53:55,624
Can I go home in an hour?

1386
01:53:55,829 --> 01:53:57,126
If he dies, a bad dream would be over.

1387
01:53:57,330 --> 01:53:59,389
If you also die, your wife would
say the same thing.

1388
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:01,294
If you die, people in your hospital
would say so.

1389
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:05,562
Drink!
Hello!

1390
01:54:05,772 --> 01:54:08,240
- Your husband?
- No, your husband.

1391
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:12,137
What should I do now?

1392
01:54:12,345 --> 01:54:13,972
Death has made to do all the right things.

1393
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:16,808
- What should I do now?
- No more tension.

1394
01:54:17,684 --> 01:54:19,481
The anti-dote injection for you,

1395
01:54:19,853 --> 01:54:21,411
is in the parking lot of
Devi Centre Complex,

1396
01:54:21,754 --> 01:54:24,655
in the car number TN 69 - P - 0101,

1397
01:54:25,491 --> 01:54:26,082
run!

1398
01:54:31,464 --> 01:54:32,590
We've reached the shopping complex.

1399
01:54:32,799 --> 01:54:34,664
Sir, buy a new cell for
throwing my phone.

1400
01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:45,106
- Boys, search!
- Don't leave any vehicle.

1401
01:54:48,214 --> 01:54:51,115
I think he'll die before they find the car.

1402
01:54:51,818 --> 01:54:53,445
I think he'll be buried here only.

1403
01:54:53,653 --> 01:54:55,211
Doctor, don't say like that.

1404
01:54:55,555 --> 01:54:56,749
He has to buy me a phone.

1405
01:54:57,156 --> 01:55:05,120

1406
01:55:05,598 --> 01:55:07,930
Hey, where's the car?

1407
01:55:08,234 --> 01:55:09,201
Turn back and see.

1408
01:55:11,237 --> 01:55:14,604
He has kept the anti-dote
in our vehicle only.

1409
01:55:16,309 --> 01:55:17,867
Very smart man!

1410
01:55:18,645 --> 01:55:20,875
Thanks, my wife too calls me
like that only.

1411
01:55:23,116 --> 01:55:24,378
Be careful... slow...

1412
01:55:29,422 --> 01:55:34,382
I got the medicine!
He has kept it in this bag. It's in this.

1413
01:55:35,261 --> 01:55:36,159
Here only.

1414
01:55:37,230 --> 01:55:39,061
Has he kept here only?

1415
01:55:39,399 --> 01:55:42,891
I saw while boarding but wanted
to take it while alighting.

1416
01:55:43,102 --> 01:55:43,568
What?

1417
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:46,398
I'm checking the manufacturing date.
Expiry is very important.

1418
01:55:46,606 --> 01:55:50,235
- For him?
- 2012 September. Okay.

1419
01:55:50,443 --> 01:55:52,411
Fast... fast... Give me the injection quickly.

1420
01:55:52,612 --> 01:55:53,909
Be patient, there's still time.

1421
01:55:54,113 --> 01:55:56,411
- How much time?
- Still 2 minutes!

1422
01:55:57,951 --> 01:56:01,682
Pull up your shirt, still further.

1423
01:56:09,963 --> 01:56:12,488
How many millions you would've
spent for this medicine?

1424
01:56:12,699 --> 01:56:15,327
First time in my career I'm using
the costliest injection.

1425
01:56:18,972 --> 01:56:24,342
You're saved! You're saved!
You got back your life.

1426
01:56:31,718 --> 01:56:33,208
Why are you arresting me?

1427
01:56:36,222 --> 01:56:37,348
Check your bag.

1428
01:56:43,896 --> 01:56:45,056
Your heroin only.

1429
01:56:45,665 --> 01:56:49,294
You wanted me to check peripherally,
I too wanted to follow you,

1430
01:56:50,336 --> 01:56:52,964
but my soul didn't listen,
so I searched little deeper,

1431
01:56:53,172 --> 01:56:55,299
I found this,
I've returned your material,

1432
01:56:56,175 --> 01:56:57,574
we don't have anymore connection.

1433
01:56:57,844 --> 01:56:59,641
Are you a police officer or goon?

1434
01:57:01,514 --> 01:57:05,348
Blood in veins belong to a goon,
but the food I eat belongs to police.

1435
01:57:07,086 --> 01:57:09,486
On the whole I'm a number one fraud!

1436
01:57:10,857 --> 01:57:12,916
The man who raised me
gave a good advice,

1437
01:57:13,526 --> 01:57:15,255
give law the first chance,

1438
01:57:16,029 --> 01:57:19,931
if it misses, then take the
second chance yourself.

1439
01:57:20,533 --> 01:57:26,335
So, just go to jail following
law will take it's own course.

1440
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:32,268
If you play any game and come out,
I'll rip you off.

1441
01:57:38,317 --> 01:57:39,181
Go man!

1442
01:57:50,263 --> 01:57:52,128
One day I got a phone call from Father.

1443
01:57:53,066 --> 01:57:59,027
A girl who was adopted from here
like Aishwarya called me on phone,

1444
01:57:59,572 --> 01:58:01,767
she has been in contact
with Aishwarya on phone,

1445
01:58:03,409 --> 01:58:05,775
this file has all the details about her.

1446
01:58:08,014 --> 01:58:09,208
Thank you very much, Father.

1447
01:58:09,782 --> 01:58:12,216
6 months leave?
Why do you want such a long leave?

1448
01:58:12,418 --> 01:58:15,717
After years of search,
I've found my sister.

1449
01:58:16,022 --> 01:58:19,549
This time is also not enough to make
her forgive me and call me as brother.

1450
01:58:19,759 --> 01:58:21,989
- Okay, all the best.
- Thank you sir.

1451
01:58:32,939 --> 01:58:35,806
Easwaramurthy here!
It seems you've a sister!

1452
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:40,238
Shocked?
I want to see you now.

1453
01:58:41,114 --> 01:58:45,517
Every goon in this city has left
in search of your sister.

1454
01:58:45,918 --> 01:58:46,577
No!

1455
01:58:46,786 --> 01:58:49,482
I want to see fear in your eyes
before I die.

1456
01:58:50,056 --> 01:58:52,422
I'll kill your sister right before your eyes.

1457
01:58:53,126 --> 01:58:56,186
Run... this is my round... run!

1458
01:58:57,363 --> 01:58:59,263
If you can, save your sister.

1460
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:25,951
After years I've reached Aishwarya,
but I've brought death along with me.

1461
01:59:26,592 --> 01:59:28,457
Accepting me as brother
isn't important now,

1462
01:59:29,896 --> 01:59:31,454
it's more important to protect her life.

1463
01:59:37,170 --> 01:59:41,971
I've seen relatives who
consider me as burden.

1464
01:59:43,342 --> 01:59:50,646
My own brother left disowning me
when I was a little girl.

1465
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:57,319
Still I'm unable to digest it.

1466
01:59:58,124 --> 02:00:02,754
Though you're not connected to me,
you saved me risking your life.

1467
02:00:03,196 --> 02:00:08,998
I can't repay my gratitude
with just a thanks.

1468
02:00:29,889 --> 02:00:35,350
He killed Raja Pandi here only!
I can still hear his cries.

1469
02:00:35,895 --> 02:00:38,363
Brother-in-law, please don't mistake
me for saying this,

1470
02:00:38,564 --> 02:00:39,861
he dotes his sister,

1471
02:00:40,066 --> 02:00:43,035
if you harm her,
he'll go to any extent,

1472
02:00:43,236 --> 02:00:45,363
don't go for revenge,
we don't have any choice,

1473
02:00:45,571 --> 02:00:48,802
be humane, let's go home.
Come, let's go.

1474
02:00:56,082 --> 02:00:58,812
Anyone of you wish to live!

1475
02:01:02,255 --> 02:01:04,723
This is my friend's house,
you're safe here.

1476
02:01:05,258 --> 02:01:06,054
Thanks.

1477
02:01:07,460 --> 02:01:09,951
Stay here for few days,
I'll get your medicines.

1478
02:01:10,162 --> 02:01:14,292
- Paru, look after her.
- See, how she's avoiding me.

1479
02:01:16,602 --> 02:01:19,969
You've helped me a lot without seeking,
first time I'm asking you something,

1480
02:01:20,206 --> 02:01:23,073
- you won't say no, right?
- Tell me.

1481
02:01:24,010 --> 02:01:25,136
Promise?

1482
02:01:28,481 --> 02:01:29,243
Promise!

1483
02:01:29,448 --> 02:01:33,316
Paru is very good girl,
She loves you very much.

1484
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:35,647
I know you too like her.

1485
02:01:35,888 --> 02:01:38,755
She'll be happy if you express it to her.

1486
02:01:39,058 --> 02:01:42,755
If our union will give you happiness,
then I'll accept happily.

1487
02:01:44,030 --> 02:01:44,928
Thanks.

1488
02:01:48,467 --> 02:01:51,925
If I cry now and create sympathy
for one side love,

1489
02:01:52,138 --> 02:01:54,436
Aishwarya will unite me with Paru.

1490
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:56,005
Let us play!

1491
02:01:58,644 --> 02:02:01,841
What's this master? Dust fell in your eyes,
why are you not clearing it?

1492
02:02:02,048 --> 02:02:03,606
Wash your face.

1493
02:02:04,917 --> 02:02:06,282
- Master!
- What?

1494
02:02:07,153 --> 02:02:08,552
I had coffee.

1495
02:02:08,821 --> 02:02:12,882
No, wash it clean and get tea for us.
Hold it.

1496
02:02:13,626 --> 02:02:16,993
I don't mind if she says buy tea
but says wash and buy.

1497
02:02:17,663 --> 02:02:19,688
Shame... shame... puppy shame.

1498
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:23,297

Hurting her cheeks and
leaving wounds on it...

Where's that Prabhakaran IPS?
Where's your courage now?

1558
02:08:05,944 --> 02:08:10,472
Where's your police arrogance?
I've made you kneel before me, right?

1559
02:08:10,849 --> 02:08:13,409
Aren't you shivering at the
mention of my name?

1560
02:08:13,852 --> 02:08:17,413
He's toothless snake.
Thrash him boys!

1561
02:08:30,636 --> 02:08:37,508
No... no... Leave him! Leave him!

02:08:42,314 --> 02:08:48,844
No! No!
Leave him!

1563
02:08:56,395 --> 02:08:57,919
Don't beat him.

1564
02:08:59,231 --> 02:09:04,692
I'm responsible for all the trouble.
He came to help me.

1565
02:09:05,471 --> 02:09:10,704
He's not in any way related to me.
Please leave him.

1566
02:09:10,909 --> 02:09:13,036

Yes.

1568
02:09:14,079 --> 02:09:19,210
Doesn't she know the truth?
Didn't you tell you're her brother?

1569
02:09:20,819 --> 02:09:27,224
He's your own brother!
One who disowned in childhood.

1570
02:09:29,361 --> 02:09:32,558
Ever since then, he has been
searching for you madly.

1571
02:09:32,765 --> 02:09:34,892
But picked up fight with me in between.

1572
02:09:37,936 --> 02:09:41,064
I've challenged to kill his sister
right before his eyes.

1573
02:09:42,574 --> 02:09:46,408
Ever since then, he has been
guarding you like a dog.

1574
02:09:54,219 --> 02:09:57,484
He challenged death but
now begging for life.

1575
02:10:00,058 --> 02:10:06,759
See your sister for the last time.
Don't die before seeing her death.

1576
02:10:06,965 --> 02:10:13,768
I left my sister unable to get
her a morsel of food,

1577
02:10:14,473 --> 02:10:16,941
I've been yearning for 15 long years,

1578
02:10:18,744 --> 02:10:26,617
every drop of my blood coming out
is seeking her forgiveness,

1579
02:10:27,986 --> 02:10:29,283
kill me,

1580
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:35,448
but even if you make a little
scratch on my sister,

1581
02:10:36,662 --> 02:10:41,122
I'll not die before killing you!

1582
02:10:41,767 --> 02:10:44,292
Thinking of saving your sister
even on the verge of death.

1583
02:10:44,837 --> 02:10:47,965
If you can, save her.
Kill him!
