1
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,541
Hey, I'm sitting here!

2
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:39,250
This won't work.
It's got to be Digital India.

3
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,333
There's a spot.

4
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,875
Turn off those headlights!
I'm taking a dump here!

5
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,500
Grab him!
He's shitting in the woods!

6
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,708
-You can't teach an old dog new tricks!
-What do you care where I poop?

7
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,333
-Just come with us!
-Let go!

8
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
-Get in the truck.
-Let me go!

9
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,166
-Let me go!
-Get in!

10
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,000
Marudu, round them up.
Don't spare anyone.

11
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,333
There is someone over there
as well. Get him!

12
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,458
-Hey! Where are you taking me?
-Come on!

13
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,500
-But I'm not done!
-That's enough.

14
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,250
Trotting about with mugs!

15
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,000
Get down, all of you!

16
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,666
Get down, everyone.

17
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,208
-Go and stand with those men.
-Get down!

18
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,458
-Hurry up!
-Get down!

19
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:45,833
Get down.

20
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,833
Join them!

21
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,875
CLEAN INDIA CAMPAIGN
PUBLIC TOILET - SOORANGUDI

22
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:57,000
It's the first ever toilet in Soorangudi!
In North Soorangudi, no less.

23
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,250
What do you think?

24
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,416
THE MAGNANIMOUS BUILDER OF TOILETS!

25
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,208
Greetings, sir!

26
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,541
-Is everyone here?
-Yes.

27
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,458
Hey, turn that off!

28
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,916
We are opening a toilet
in North Soorangudi.

29
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,250
I thought the Northerners would throng
to celebrate our community's might.

30
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,083
But you went to
do your business in the bushes!

31
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,375
One toilet for an entire village
to shit in? That's great!

32
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,583
Sudalai, cut the crap!

33
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,958
This is not just about shitting.

34
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,125
We will lose our pride if the leader
finds out that you shat in the bushes.

35
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,875
It's not about shitting.
It's a matter of pride.

36
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,458
You can shit later.

37
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,041
Hey, turn off the damn music!

38
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,333
Here come the Southerners!

39
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,500
Now, I'll have to hold it in forever.

40
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,083
Come here, hold it

41
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,333
Lift it.

42
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,166
Place it there. Higher.

43
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,791
Fasten it at that end.

44
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,166
THE PRINCE OF SOORANGUDI!

45
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,583
Come on, let's go

46
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,000
Mate, this is not even
a western water closet.

47
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,625
All this fuss for an Indian toilet!

48
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:58,833
Why are you here?

49
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,791
To offer our prayers.

50
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,083
Why would one come to a toilet?

51
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,333
Why would you bring
a crowbar to the toilet?

52
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,666
Mathi, the leader has
built this toilet for our people.

53
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,000
Your people can't be here.

54
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,875
-Leave before he arrives.
-What?

55
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,458
Only for your people?
What's written up there?

56
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,166
"Soorangudi Public Toilet."

57
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,875
Doesn't public mean common for all?

58
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,500
Oh, you have finally
understood what public means!

59
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,875
When a new school was built in the
South, didn't you keep our kids out?

60
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,833
Have you forgotten about that?

61
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,708
It's not like you let that slide.

62
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:32,541
You demolished the school overnight,
and ruined it for our kids as well.

63
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,166
Enough of that rubbish!

64
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,833
This toilet is in North Soorangudi,
which means it's only for us.

65
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,875
We will see!

66
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,666
Brother, they are here
just to provoke us.

67
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,958
There's no point in talking to them.

68
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,750
Perhaps a few slaps
will make them scram!

69
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah, right.
I dare you to touch me.

70
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,666
Kaalai, put your slippers back on!

71
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,916
Be patient.

72
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,500
Let's wait for the leader.

73
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,500
Let him decide who uses the toilet.

74
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,291
Till then, nobody moves.
Go and find the leader.

75
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,791
Well, then, we'll also wait here.

76
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,458
This ends today.

77
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,333
Sit down, all of you.

78
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,583
Nobody will leave
until the leader arrives.

79
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,291
-Sudalai, sit down.
-Sit.

80
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,041
Devi?

81
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,583
Devi?

82
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,083
Valli?

83
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:28,833
Valli?

84
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,833
Is anyone home?

85
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,666
Devi!

86
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,833
-What is it?
-There's a stain on my <i>veshti</i>.

87
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,958
-I have to go to the opening ceremony.
-Right, the opening ceremony!

88
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,541
I'm supposed to be
the village president's wife.

89
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,666
Had my son Rathinam been
granted the toilet contract,

90
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,333
he would have made good money.

91
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,625
But you gave to it to
some random stranger.

92
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:06,958
You better grant the road building
contracts to my son Rathinam!

93
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,958
What about my son Mathi then?

94
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,458
My Southern folks tell me
that he works hard like you,

95
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,166
even though he is young.

96
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,958
My son Mathi should be
given the road contracts.

97
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,208
Despite being a follower of Periyar,

98
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,750
why do I wear the colors
of two caste-based parties?

99
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,958
By remaining neutral,
I hope people would listen to me.

100
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,958
If it weren't for me, they would
have beaten each other to death.

101
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,333
The reason I married two women
from different communitiesâ€¦

102
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,833
is to avoid such conflicts.

103
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,958
I know they are both my sons.

104
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,541
But if I grant the contract to Rathinam,
the Southerners will get angry.

105
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:49,041
And If the contract goes to Mathi,
the Northerners will storm into our house.

106
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,416
I'm caught between
a rock and a hard place.

107
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:55,166
I don't care!
I want Mathi to get the road contract.

108
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,000
Or else, I'll get my people
to stage a blockade.

109
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,541
Then you will have to lay
the roads over my dead body.

110
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,000
He is only fond of his eldest!

111
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,000
If my son Rathinam doesn't get
the road building contract,

112
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:10,000
I will ensure that no good
ever happens to this village.

113
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,250
Sir!

114
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,500
Sir!

115
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,666
Turn up the volume.

116
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,541
Hey! Can't you drive slower?

117
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,500
Both your sons are
at the opening ceremony.

118
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,666
If we don't hurry,
there could be a clash between them.

119
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,208
They will never learn.

120
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,833
This ends today.
It's either us or them.

121
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,041
The leader is here.

122
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:48,916
Sir.

123
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,291
Greetings, sir.

124
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,958
Won't you let anything good
happen in this village?

125
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,250
That's not true, sir.

126
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,416
Public toilet is open to all, right?

127
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,541
Is it fair to stop
the Southerners from using it?

128
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,875
It has been built in the North,
it's for the Northerners.

129
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,250
But the Southerners
are causing trouble!

130
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,458
What's a toilet got to do with
North and South? It's a public toilet.

131
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,458
But we only have one toilet.

132
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,416
I built just one hoping you both
would come together at least for this.

133
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,041
Hand me the scissors.

134
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,500
Wonderful! The dog
inaugurated the toilet already!

135
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,208
That ribbon has gone to waste.

136
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,250
Hey, go and clean it up.

137
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,791
-He's asking us to clean it up.
-Stay put, let them do it.

138
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,291
Sir, our people
don't do such chores.

139
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,875
It's your butthole that shits,
but you expect others to clean it?

140
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,291
I'll clean it.

141
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,291
-Sir!
-Sir, how can youâ€¦

142
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,875
What do we do now?

143
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,583
There is a way.

144
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:49,791
What?

145
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,958
Murugesan, go and find Jackass.

146
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:52,916
Who?

147
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,291
Smile.

148
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,666
BARBER SHOP
SOORANGUDI

149
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:16,166
<i>-We are not kings who rule over countries</i>
<i>-We are not!</i>

150
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,166
<i>-Yet we are busy working with the crown</i>
<i>-The crown!</i>

151
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:25,083
<i>Even monarchs must hold their heads still</i>
<i>When we say the wordâ€¦</i>

152
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,708
Hey, wake up!

153
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,083
Hey!

154
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,333
The leader has sent for Jackass.

155
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,791
Smile!

156
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,833
Smile!

157
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,750
Wake up!

158
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,458
-What is it?
-The leader has called for you. Hurry up.

159
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,416
Hurry up!

160
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:25,916
Come on.

161
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:35,916
Let's go.

162
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,583
Get down!

163
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,666
Don't you know your caste?

164
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,416
Have you no shame?
How dare you get in the car?

165
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,416
You said it was urgent, soâ€¦

166
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,291
Does that mean
you get in the car as an equal?

167
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,125
-Just follow me!
-Okay.

168
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,875
These pests are forbidden from using front
doors and they want to ride in a car!

169
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,375
Come, let's go.

170
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:11,666
If he didn't want us in the car,
then why did he bring the car?

171
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,333
Maybe he doesn't know
how to ride pillion. Keep going.

172
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,416
How can you ride pillion in a car?

173
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,541
He's here.

174
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,541
Greetings, sir.

175
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,833
Had you sent a word,
I would have come home.

176
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,000
We didn't call you for a shave!

177
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,541
Go and clean up the toilet.

178
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,208
You didn't call us for a shave?
Cleaning toilets is not our job.

179
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,208
Why?

180
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,583
Do you consider it
beneath you to clean toilets?

181
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,875
Don't force him.
I'll do it myself.

182
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:53,916
Sirâ€¦

183
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,125
Why would you do that?
Please be seated.

184
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,416
Are you going to stand there
and let the leader clean the toilet?

185
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,541
There's no way
the leader will clean it.

186
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,125
Sir, I'll do it.

187
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,083
Hold this.

188
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,791
It's done, sir.

189
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,458
At least pay him for his services.

190
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,541
-Step aside.
-Make way.

191
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,041
Keep walking.

192
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,875
-Sir, my money?
-No, thanks.

193
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,583
Hand me the scissors.

194
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,916
Pass the scissors.

195
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,750
Here.

196
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,041
Give it to him.

197
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,708
It's that simple!
There's no reason to fight over this.

198
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,791
-Make way.
-Step aside.

199
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,166
What are you waiting for?
Get started!

200
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,916
Esaki, you go first.

201
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,250
-Shall I?
-Yes.

202
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,666
Why does he get to go first?

203
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,583
Aren't we Northerners queued up?

204
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,583
Sudalai, you go first.

205
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,083
Why me?

206
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,708
Esaki is waiting here.

207
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,583
I said, go!

208
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:30,708
Go.

209
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,125
Get that billhook.

210
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,500
If any of you steps foot in there,
I will chop your legs off!

211
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,458
Listenâ€¦

212
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,083
I can't go in confined spaces.

213
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,125
I'll go out in the open,
where it's breezy.

214
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,458
Shut up, man!

215
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,291
Mathi, we've agreed that
it's common to both our villages.

216
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,166
So many of our people are waiting.

217
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,958
Let them go first.

218
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,291
You can go later.

219
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,625
Get in there!

220
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,041
Stop! Why so?

221
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,666
So that it goes down in history that the
Southerners shat after the Northerners?

222
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,000
Our caste is nothing less than yours.

223
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,208
Why the hell should we go second?

224
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,791
Our caste is no less important!

225
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,083
You have brought caste
into shitting as well!

226
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,750
You have a problem over
who gets to shit first, right?

227
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,000
I'll go first.

228
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,166
-Sir, you don't have to--
-Shut up!

229
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,958
Wow! The leader shitting first is like
adorning the walls with sandal paste.

230
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,625
This doesn't count.

231
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,416
What matters is who gets to go next.

232
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,000
Here we go again!

233
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,791
It is obvious.
It has to be a Southerner.

234
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,541
Yeah, right!

235
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,500
People who don't wipe their asses
want to use toilets now!

236
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,250
Who the hell was that?

237
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,375
Look at him.

238
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,583
Right.

239
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,541
Hey! Don't fight! Stop it!

240
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,750
Come on, let's go in the fields now.

241
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,375
We are fighting for our pride
and you still want to shit?

242
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,791
Give me that mug!

243
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,583
Get out of here!

244
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,166
They are fighting over
who gets to use the toilet first.

245
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,166
Nobody even bothered to
check if there is water supply.

246
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,833
Out of my way!

247
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,041
Sir?

248
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:56,708
Sir?

249
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,458
How dare you lay a hand on me?

250
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,041
Die!

251
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,125
Sir!

252
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,041
Your Southern asses want to
shit in the North? Bloody pests!

253
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,875
He is beating me up!

254
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,541
Brother, help me!

255
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,250
How dare you hit him!

256
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,500
Sir!

257
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,583
-Mathi, lift his legs.
-Watch the steps.

258
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,625
-Make way.
-Careful.

259
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,791
Mind his head.

260
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,083
Gently.

261
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:41,333
If we must share it with the Southerners,
we don't want a toilet at all.

262
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,458
Demolish it.

263
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,708
Let's go.

264
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,375
Demolish the toilet!

265
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,291
Come on.

266
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,458
Wreck it!

267
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,833
-Destroy it!
-Raze it to the ground!

268
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,541
Wreck it!

269
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,458
-Wreck every last brick.
-Come on!

270
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,333
Smash it up!

271
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,208
Break down the other wall!

272
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,750
Bring it down.

273
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:24,541
<i>There is one ancient code</i>
<i>That divides us into many castes</i>

274
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,500

275
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,958
<i>Our village is a paradise</i>

276
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,375
<i>Where the river runs free</i>

277
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,791
<i>Hear ye, our rivalry</i>

278
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,916
<i>Where brothers fight with each other</i>

279
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,250
<i>Our village is a bed of roses</i>
<i>There's nothing quite like it</i>

280
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,125
Jackass! Come in through
the back porch.

281
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,250
<i>No job, no wages</i>

282
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,333
-Yes, ma'am?
-The old man needs a shave.

283
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,166
<i>We spin tall tales</i>

284
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,166
<i>All talk and no trousers</i>
<i>We spin tall tales</i>

285
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,166
<i>Is there anyone so pure</i>
<i>Who hasn't heard of caste?</i>

286
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,291
Side Burnâ€¦

287
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,041
<i>Is there a way to defy the code?</i>

288
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,000
Ten rupees.

289
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,625
You want ten rupees
for shaving a couple of hairs?

290
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,208
I was hoping for some money.
But porridge works just fine.

291
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,416
-Do the dishes on your way out.
-Sure.

292

294
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,208
He has thorns for a back door!

295
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:22,125
<i>We have a hundred divisions</i>
<i>But we claim to be one</i>

296
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:26,000
<i>We won't keep quiet</i>

297

298

<i>We love freebies</i>

00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,791
For your 100 rupees, should I turn
on the lights at six o'clock? Get lost!

300
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,333
<i>We forget our woes with TV</i>

304
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,166
You demolished our only school
in the name of caste.

305
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,208
All the other kids go to school,
while my son just watches them.

306
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,083
Why won't you shut up?

307
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,958

<i>Proud as a peacock</i>

311
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,250
I'm off.

312
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,916
I have dug up a 700 feet <i>borewell</i>.

313
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,541

314
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,291
You won't find good water
anywhere else in this village.

315
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,791
Don't try to haggle with me.

316

<i>Forever in debt</i>

317
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,625

318
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,125
-Take it.
-Just give me one can.

319
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:57,541
You already owe me 240 rupees.
You always have money for liquor, right?

There's no one at the counter!

325
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm going.

326
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,666
He's busy putting up posters!

327
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,458
They destroyed government property.

328
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,083
Ten people are injured.

329
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,833
One of them broke his neck.

330
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,250
Just say the word,
and I will file a case.

331
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,083
This is an internal dispute.

332
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,875
We'll resolve it among ourselves.

333
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,041
You may leave.

334
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,458
-Where to?
-Soorangudi.

335
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,125
Give me two more rupees.

336
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,833
-Ticket?
-No, thanks.

337
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,875
No one's giving you a choice.

338
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,083
Pay up.

339
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,208
This seat is vacant.
Why don't you sit?

340
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:43,625
Mind your own business.

341
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,708
At least you could sit!

342
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,125
No. He only sits in cars.

343
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,041
Sit, I dare you.

344
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,166
These people are all crazy.

345
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,458
Soorangudi. Get down!

346
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:00,125
Why can't you
drop us off at the village?

347
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,333
At my age,
I find it very hard to walk.

348
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:04,291

can damage the axles?

349
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:05,666

<i>That divides us into many castes</i>

352
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,375
Southerner to Southerner,
help me out.

353
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,125
I'm sorry.
No money, no booze.

354
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,625
Do you want to share a quarter?

355
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,208
Do you want to share a quarter?

356
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,125
<i>Where the river runs free</i>

357
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:27,708
{\an8}<i>Where brothers fight with each other</i>

358
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:31,750
{\an8}<i>Our village is a bed of roses</i>
<i>There's nothing quite like it</i>

359
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:35,666
<i>We guard our liquor store</i>
<i>By binge drinking all day</i>

360
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,041
<i>We have a hundred divisions</i>
<i>But we claim to be one</i>

361
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,625
Isn't he a Northerner?

362
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,000
Yeah, mate.

363
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,416
<i>No friction with anyone</i>
<i>That's our fiction</i>

364
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,791
<i>No citizen shall protest</i>
<i>Or I will take out my gunâ€¦</i>

365
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,041
What was the name of the village?

366
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,333
Soorangudi.

367
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:08,708
I'll take your leave, ma'am.

368
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,291
POSTAL OFFICER

369
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,666
They won't let you in their homes.

370
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,541
But they eat the rice you buy.

371
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:32,750
Do you see the irony?

372
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,541
I see the tamarind under the scale.

373
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:37,500
<i>"Even when we must skip a meal"</i>

374
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:38,541
Thank you!

375
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:42,625
<i>Cheering for our superstars</i>

376
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:46,458

377
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:51,125
<i>Cheering for our superstars</i>
<i>At the movie theaters</i>

378
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:52,500
Money?

379
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:53,625
No, thanks.

380
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,541
Everyone makes us work for free!

381
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:01,166
If you don't ask them for money,
I will.

382
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,541
No. Don't do that.

383
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:06,625
We have jobs only as long as
the villagers grow hair.

384
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:08,250
Some job this is!

385
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:10,041
He slapped you
for getting into his car.

386
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:12,416
Do you feel no pain or shame?

387
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,625
My father had a dream.

388
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,333
I want to open up a big salon
under this banyan tree.

389
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,166
I'm saving money for it.

390
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,500
I can't let go of my livelihood
in the name of dignity.

391
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:24,833
{\an8}I know it hurts,
but we must carry on.

392
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:27,750
Give me two rupees.

393
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,041
But I gave you all that lice!

394
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,625
Pay up, girl!

395
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,041
Screw you, Jackass!

396
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,416
Tell me.

397
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:22,833
Is it there?

398
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,041
Heyâ€¦

399
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,458
Esaki was loitering here yesterday.

400
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,416
Don't you buy the liquor?

401
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:40,041
So, someone stole your money.
Why have you come to me?

402
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:42,625
You were the only one
creeping around the tree yesterday.

403
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:43,583
I saw you.

404
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:45,166
Are you calling me a thief?

405
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,500
I borrowed money
at an interest to buy alcohol.

406
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:48,666
No, sir.

407
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,750
I worked hard to save money
for opening a salon.

408
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Have you seen it?

409
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,750
Had I seen it,
I would have given it to you.

410
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:56,458
If you wanted to open a salon,

411
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:59,833
you should have deposited it
in the bank or the post office.

412
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:03,083
You can take a loan
from them to open a salon.

413
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:05,083
That's how I got
a loan for my tractor.

414
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,500
You bought a tractor?

415
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,333
No, I just took the loan.

416
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:10,000
Okay.

417
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:11,750
I will deposit my money
in the post office.

418
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:14,416
But you have lost all your money.
What's left to deposit?

419
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,833
I only lost my money.

420
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:20,375
I had kept Side Burn's
4,000 rupees tucked in at my waist.

421
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:21,833
Four thousand rupees?

422
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:23,833
Tucked in at your waist?

423
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,125
Alright.

424
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:39,916
There is no back entrance here.
How do we enter?

425
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:41,458
So, have you got the total?

426
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:44,625
When you deposit it
in the account three weeks laterâ€¦

427
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,250
What do you want?

428
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,916
Doesn't this place
have a back entrance?

429
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,791
No. Please come in.

430
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:55,500
Please give me an account
to put my money in.

431
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,875
An account isn't some object
that you put your money in.

432
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:01,250
We will safely keep
your money here in your name.

433
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,500
-That's called an account.
-Here?

434
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,333
Go and get your <i>Aadhaar</i> card.
You need it for the registration.

435
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:10,541
Okay.

436
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:13,916
But you don't have any identity card.

437
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,541
Why did you just nod to her?

438
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,666
I'll just say, "I'm a man who
resides under a banyan tree."

439
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,916
They will give me an
<i>Aadhaar</i> card. Let's go.

440
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:24,333
That's how the door is.
Put it back on your way out.

441
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:29,625
Looks like this place might crumble.
Should we really put our money here?

442
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,250
Still better than hiding it
in the bark of the tree.

443
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:39,000
You need a ration card
to apply for an <i>Aadhaar</i> card.

444
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,666
-Do you have a ration card?
-You want a ration card?

445
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:42,958
Do you have a voter ID?

446
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:44,916
We can get you a voter ID.

447
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:47,000
Show me your <i>Aadhaar</i> card.

448
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,708
-You don't have any identity card?
-No.

449
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:55,250
If you don't have any identification,

450
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,625
how do I believe that
you are an Indian citizen?

451
00:28:57,708 --> 00:29:00,291
Well, does he look like
an American to you?

452
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,416
Believe me, he is an Indian citizen.

453
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:06,666
Sit.

454
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:07,875
It's fine.

455
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,208
Sit!

456
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:16,250
You can't open an account
without an identity card.

457
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,375
We need your birth certificate.

458
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:20,791
We can look for your name
in the records.

459
00:29:20,916 --> 00:29:22,041
What's your name?

460
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:23,750
Smile.

461
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:25,708
Smile?
What sort of a name is that?

462
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:28,708
My mouth doesn't shut properly.
It looks like I'm smiling all the time.

463
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:32,333
So, everyone calls me
Smile or Jackass.

464
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:34,833
Are these your only names?
Don't you have any other name?

465
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:35,791
He does!

466
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:39,416
Bushy Hair, Dung Picker, Rice Sack,
and several other names.

467
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,916
These are not real names!

468
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,541
Didn't your parents
give you a name?

469
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:44,875
They must have.
But I don't remember it.

470
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:48,500
People kept calling me so many names
that I eventually forgot my actual name.

471
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:51,375
You can't just give up your
real name because of these people.

472
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:52,583
Here's what you can do.

473
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:56,000
Go to the villagers and
find out your real name.

474
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:58,208
I'm sure someone would know.

475
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:02,541
What could they have named you?

476
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,916
They still give us names
like Ramesh or Suresh.

477
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,750
I'm sure they didn't
name you Virat Kohli.

478
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:07,916
My kid knows it!

479
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,916
Girl, what's his name?

480
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,625
-Say it!
-Monster!

481
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,291
You should have come straight to me.

482
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:17,375
I was the one
who named you at birth.

483
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:18,583
What was it?

484
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:20,416
It's a beautiful name.

485
00:30:20,916 --> 00:30:23,708
It's on the tip of my tongue,
but I can't recall itâ€¦

486
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,333
You got a <i>beedi</i>?

487
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:28,333
Get him a <i>beedi</i>.

488
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:33,875
Your father named you Smile.

489
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,291
He could hardly manage Tamil,
and he gave me an English name?

490
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,958
Grandpaâ€¦

491
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:45,833
Yes, I remember.

492
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,750
Your name isâ€¦

493
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,625
Your nameâ€¦

494
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:56,500
It's on the tip of my tongue.

495
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:58,833
You got a <i>beedi</i>?

496
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:10,041
-Hand me the sample.
-The site limits end with the river.

497
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:13,166
Hey, go away!

498
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:14,333
Go!

499
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,333
Sir, coffee?

500
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:17,041
-No. I'm on a diet.
-Okay.

501
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:19,625
Are you eating well?

502
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,333
The local body elections are
just two months away.

503
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:25,666
You chose the wrong time to fall sick!

504
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,083
There's no need to worry.
I will contest the elections.

505
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:31,000
What? You will contest it?

506
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,125
You can barely sit upright.

507
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:36,125
The approval for the quartz factory
is still pending.

508
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,875
Why don't you just take a look
at it and approve it?

509
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,500
What is it?

510
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:44,458
A factory in the village
is a sign of development.

511
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:47,000
There will be better roads,
and water supply.

512
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,083
All the villagers will get jobs.

513
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:51,958
They will build a new school.

514
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,250
They will build a hospital
for their employees.

515
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,333
Your people can use it too.

516
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:58,666
Your village will turn into a city.

517
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,291
I'm sure it will.

518
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:05,333
But our villagers won't be alive
to enjoy the facilities of a city.

519
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:08,916
They are willing to pay crores
for the president's signature.

520
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,833
It's about time you made some money.

521
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:16,375
I will not give my signature for a project
that will bring harm to the village.

522
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:19,375
We took a good look
at everything you've accomplished.

523
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:22,500
You used lakhs from the funds
to build a school and a toilet.

524
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:23,916
But what was the outcome?

525
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,541
They lay in ruins!

526
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:27,458
This village has been
rotting for many years.

527
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:29,916
A factory won't make it any worse.

528
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:42,750
Here's an idea.

529
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:44,958
Don't contest the elections.

530
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:47,416
Give someone else a chance.

531
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,416
Let your son contest instead.

532
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,250
My sons fight over a toilet!

533
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,250
They will end up
splitting the village in two.

534
00:32:58,333 --> 00:32:59,416
Of course not.

535
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:00,958
You have a lot of clout.

536
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:03,541
Whoever you point to
will become the next president.

537
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:06,125
No one will argue over your decision.

538
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:09,458
So, just go ahead and
point to your successor.

539
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:12,041
Hopefully the new president
will accomplish something.

540
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,541
I'll see you later.

541
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:15,500
See you, ma'am.

542
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,541
Sir, is the president's signature
all we need?

543
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:31,458
Yes.

544
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:33,250
You said they will pay us in crores.

545
00:33:33,541 --> 00:33:35,125
What's the ballpark figure?

546
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:38,500
About five large ones.

547
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,708
Five crore rupees?

548
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:41,083
Let's go.

549
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:51,458
Their jaws dropped
at five crore rupees.

550
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:53,625
If we reveal that
it's actually 30 crore rupees,

551
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:55,291
they might even sell the village!

552
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:56,500
I don't care what they do.

553
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:59,625
I just want my commission,
which is ten percent flat.

554
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,375
Drive carefully, please!

555
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:07,458
I can't help it.
These roads are terrible.

556
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:22,958
Well, nobody knows my
name in the village.

557
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:24,708
Let's just go with Smile.

558
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:26,791
Keep my money safe.

559
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:29,791
Let's give you a new name.

560
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:31,625
A new name?

561
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:34,541
Is that possible?

562
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:37,083
All you need is a signature
from the village president.

563
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:40,916
We can use that to get you
an <i>Aadhaar</i> card, voter ID, etc.

564
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:43,958
Tell me.
What kind of a name do you want?

565
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,166
Any name that suits me.

566
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:50,416
Ready?

567
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:53,833
Gandhi?

568
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:56,958
It doesn't suit him.

569
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:00,875
Netaji?

570
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:06,500
Rohit Sharma!

571
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:08,708
Turn back.

572
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:13,000
Ajith Kumar.

573
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:14,875
Don't you dare turn!

574
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:16,916
Try another name.

575
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,875
Atharva?

576
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:18,958
Jagapathi Babu?

577
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:20,041
Phillips?

578
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:21,291
Ganapathi Iyer?

579
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:22,541
Hussain Bhai?

580
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,791
Nesamani!

581
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:30,625
Manonmani.

582
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:33,875
Pichamuthu.

583
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,125
Mandela!

584
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,125
Sounds good!

585
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,458
-Who is he?
-He was just like you!

586
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:54,750
Was he a barber like me?

587
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:58,083
Just like you are
fighting for your identity,

588
00:35:58,166 --> 00:36:01,750
he was a revolutionary who fought
for the identity of black people.

589
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:04,458
I have no clue
what he fought forâ€¦

590
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:07,041
but he has curly hair
and dark skin just like me.

591
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,458
And he looks really smart.

592
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,250
This is your new name!

593
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:12,458
If anyone calls you
Jackass ever again,

594
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:14,958
you will tell them,
"My name is Nelson Mandela."

595
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:16,250
Say the name again.

596
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:18,750
Nelsonâ€¦

597
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:21,583
Mandela.

598
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,916
Nelson Mandela.

599
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,291
What a great name!

600
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:36,583
Sounds like an upper-caste name.

601
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:37,958
Do you like the name?

602
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,833
Then it's yours to keep.

603
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:42,541
How about a new name
for you as well?

604
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:44,250
Why? What's wrong with Side Burn?

605
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:46,791
Maybe we should add "Khan" to it.

606
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,250
Side Burn Khan.

607
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:51,375
Side Burn Khan.
It has a nice ring to it.

608
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:52,541
Side Burn Khan.

609
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:53,958
Let's go to the town.

610
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,250
We need to click a photo.

611
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,250
Sit.

612
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:03,333
Come

613
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,500
Look here.

614
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,250
Ready? Smile!

615
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,750
-Nelson Mandela.
-That's me.

616
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:45,458
Here. Keep this safe.

617
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:47,791
I've used this to apply
for all your ID cards.

618
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:50,583
If Esaki asks for my money,
don't give it to him, ma'am.

619
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:53,583
The money is in your account.
No one else can take it.

620
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:56,500
And stop calling me "ma'am."
It makes me feel old.

621
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:58,291
Okay.

622
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:01,500
You went all the way to town
just to help me.

623
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,541
But I have nothing to give you.

624
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:04,958
There's no need for that.

625
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:07,583
Maybe I couldâ€¦

626
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:10,500
dye your Grey hairs?

627
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:19,708
Mandela!

628
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:23,791
I just wanted to
call you by your name.

629
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,166
<i>Calling out your name, handsome!</i>

630
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,291
What?

631
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:39,083
<i>There she goes</i>
<i>Like a beautiful blossomed flower</i>

632
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:43,833
<i>She's raising a roof over your head</i>

633
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:47,250
<i>She's barging into your heart</i>

634
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,750
<i>Playing the wedding drums</i>

635
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:55,625
<i>Sends a message to the skies</i>

636
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:59,833
<i>Watch the shaving blade glint!</i>

637
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,958
<i>-Who's on his mind?</i>
-Hop on.

638
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:10,666
-Get down.
-Come, Grandma.

639
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,500
Take her basket.

640
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:32,541
Are these people disabled?

641
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:34,458
Why can't they collect their own ration?

642
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:36,916
I live at their mercy.
I must do as they say.

643
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,333
You don't need anybody's mercy.

644
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:41,291
You toil to make your own money.
You need not do all this!

645
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:47,791
-Let's go.
-<i>This fragrant blossom has spoken</i>

646
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:51,916
<i>She is straightforward and outspoken</i>

647
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,166
<i>The wafting wind delivered a message</i>

648
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,625
<i>Carrying away the painful past with it</i>

649
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:04,375
<i>The blossoms in the wind sing me a story</i>

650
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:08,583
<i>Like a lovely melody</i>

651
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:11,250
<i>A pearl harvest from</i>
<i>The freshwater of Courtallam</i>

652
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:13,291
<i>A surge of water in scorched lands</i>

653
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:17,500
<i>Serenading a cactus blossom</i>
<i>Song and dance and nuptial drums!</i>

654
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:20,958
<i>Calling out your name, handsome!</i>

655
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:25,041
<i>There she goes, a fresh bloom!</i>

656
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:29,916
<i>Like a hailstorm, like a bridge</i>

657
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:33,541
<i>Here she arrives, like a solace</i>

658
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:37,083
This is just like drawing.
Try it out.

659
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:42,375
<i>The scorching summer sun is sizzling cold</i>
<i>This small anchovy is losing its sleep</i>

660
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,666
<i>These pliant scissors turn into earrings</i>
<i>The clear skies burst into showers</i>

661
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:50,416
<i>In this roofless castle</i>

662
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:54,250
<i>Even the Sun seems to giggle</i>

663
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,583
<i>Watch the shaving blade glint!</i>

664
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:02,833
<i>Watch the Sun giggle!</i>

665
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:20,500
What is it?

666
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:22,750
As the MLA said,

667
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,875
both of them want to
contest in the elections.

668
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:28,708
So, I said, whomever the leader points to
will be the one who contests the election.

669
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:30,708
Now, go ahead
and point to one of them.

670
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:53,333
What will you do if you win?

671
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:55,166
If I winâ€¦

672
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:58,250
I'll throw a party for the boys.

673
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:00,916
They have been wanting to go to Goa.

674
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:02,916
I'll take them on a trip!

675
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:05,625
He meant,
what will you do for the village?

676
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:07,083
Oh, the village!

677
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,625
Wellâ€¦

678
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:12,416
I will upgrade the bar
and make it air-conditioned.

679
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,666
What do you say?

680
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:17,083
And to celebrate my victory,
I will screen a movie.

681
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:18,916
Throw a feast.

682
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,625
It will be like a carnival.

683
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,916
What do you say?

684
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,625
It will be a grand affair.

685
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,625
That's how you people think.

686
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:28,666
When asked about people's welfare,
he only thinks of booze.

687
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,416
You need more exposure to politics.

688
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:32,833
If I get electedâ€¦

689
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:35,791
I will deposit fifteen thousand
rupees in every villager's account.

690
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:38,541
How much liquor can we buy
with that kind of money?

691
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:41,000
These people have never even heard
of bank accounts.

692
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:42,833
And he plans to deposit money!

693
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:45,416
These people will perish
before they see any progress.

694
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:46,583
Are you serious?

695
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:48,333
It's not like they will remember.

696
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,666
Don't underestimate my ability!

697
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:53,375
I'll deposit twenty thousand rupees!

698
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:54,708
Twenty thousand!

699
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,250
Twenty-five thousand.

700
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:57,375
Thirty.

701
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,458
Thirty-five.

702
00:42:58,541 --> 00:42:59,375
Forty!

703
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:00,333
-Forty--
-Stop it!

704
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,791
If you keep going at it,
this will never end.

705
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:06,333
Look, they are both itching
to serve the village.

706
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,125
The decision is yours.

707
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:18,166
Neither of you shall contest.
Get out!

708
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,708
Why not?

709
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:22,958
This will end in communal riots.

710
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:24,583
You worry about
conflicts all the time.

711
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:28,000
When you had to get the toilet built,
you made a third party do it out of fear!

712
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:31,458
When you had to get the road built,
you made a third party do it out of fear!

713
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:33,333
We won't let you off the hook this time.

714
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:35,000
You need to pick a side.

715
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:36,541
Choose one of them.

716
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:38,916
This won't work out.

717
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,333
Rathinam, you should contest.

718
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:42,458
Our people will vote for you
and make you win.

719
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:44,708
-What do you say?
-Yes, we will!

720
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:47,458
Did you hear that?
Our caste isn't inferior to theirs!

721
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,666
We Southerners must show them!

722
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,458
Mathi, you should contest!

723
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:53,291
Let's see whether
the North wins or the South!

724
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:54,958
Sure, we will.

725
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:56,291
We will win!

726
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:57,625
Oh, we'll see!

727
00:43:58,625 --> 00:44:00,375
Guys, make some noise!

728
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:02,375
-Mathi, warrior of the South!
-Rathinam, our champion!

729
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:04,500
-Mathi is one of our own!
-Hail Rathinam!

730
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:05,958
Rathinam for the village president!

731
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:08,875
Mathi for the President of India!

732
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:16,375
-Long liveâ€¦
-Rathinam!

733
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:18,125
-Long liveâ€¦
-Rathinam!

734
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:19,416
Long liveâ€¦

735
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:23,208
Rathinam is the light of the North!

736
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:26,416
-Long liveâ€¦
-Rathinam!

737
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,541
Make some noise.

738
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:29,125
-Long liveâ€¦
-Rathinam!

739
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,458
-Hail our brother!
-Hail Mathi!

740
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:33,541
-Hail our son!
-Hail Mathi!

741
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:35,625
-Hail our leaderâ€¦
-Mathi!

742
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:09,708
What symbol did they choose?

743
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:10,958
Coconut.

744
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,333
-Our symbol isâ€¦
-Coconut!

745
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:17,166
-Our symbol isâ€¦
-Coconut!

746
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,875
-Vote forâ€¦
-Coconut!

747
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:20,875
-The coconutâ€¦
-Is our symbol.

748
00:45:21,041 --> 00:45:22,833
-Our symbol isâ€¦
-Coconut!

749
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:24,708
-Coconutâ€¦
-Our symbol!

750
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:26,416
-Vote forâ€¦
-Road Roller!

751
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,625
-Our symbolâ€¦
-Road Roller!

752
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:31,458
A total of 687 votes.

753
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:35,291
Leaving out the dead and
the errors in paperwork, it's 682.

754
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:37,833
I stand to gain nothing
from winning this election.

755
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:40,625
In fact, I'll be losing money.
And yet, I am contesting.

756
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:43,750
Don't think I'm contesting
the elections for power or money.

757
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:45,625
I'm contesting for our people.

758
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:49,291
If we lose against a Northerner,
they will keep rubbing it in forever.

759
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:52,166
We cannot lose to
a Southerner at any cost.

760
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,791
We must win this election.

761
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:55,375
-Our symbol isâ€¦
-Road Roller!

762
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:56,916
-Our symbol isâ€¦
-Road Roller!

763
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,416
Make a list of all Northeners' votes.

764
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:10,958
Strike out the Northerners' names.

765
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:19,625
Do you even need to ask?

766
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:23,791
They broke my son's leg
for setting foot in their playground!

767
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:27,666
I am just waiting for payback.
You've got my vote.

768
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,666
All the Southerners will back you.
Go for it!

769
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:32,250
-I'm glad. See you.
-So long.

770
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:33,875
Give me that.

771
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:38,125
Our men have
a separate booth in the grove.

772
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,541
Give this to them
and collect 2000 rupees.

773
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:42,208
Note down the serial number.

774
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:44,375
He said he will be voting for us.

775
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:46,291
Why are you wasting money?

776
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:49,333
What if they don't turn up
on the voting day?

777
00:46:49,416 --> 00:46:54,250
With the serial numbers, we will know
who voted, and who didn't show up.

778
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:57,083
And then, we can drag
the no-shows to the polling booth.

779
00:46:58,041 --> 00:46:59,166
That's right!

780
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,208
Even our people are talking about
their 20 rupee tokens.

781
00:47:02,291 --> 00:47:04,625
Then let's give out 50 rupee tokens.

782
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:06,291
There's no need for that.

783
00:47:06,916 --> 00:47:07,958
What, then?

784
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,375
Malar!

785
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:11,375
Welcome, sister.

786
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:13,291
Take the money.

787
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:15,375
Go on.

788
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,916
Apply some vermilion.

789
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:21,708
On your nuptial chain, girl.

790
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:25,333
Apply it on your nuptial chain, girl!

791
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:30,625
Now, use the same hand
to take the money.

792
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:35,458
You have sworn your husband's life
on this money.

793
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:37,583
Vote for us without fail.

794
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,625
Let's go.

795
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:40,041
-Murugesan, I'll see you.
-Okay, brother.

796
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:41,541
Coconut symbol. Don't forget.

797
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,166
That's how it's done.

798
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:46,583
Instead, those idiots are
going around giving tokens!

799
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:47,916
Make some noise, boys.

800
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,791
-Our symbolâ€¦
-Coconut!

801
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:51,791
-Vote forâ€¦
-Coconut symbol!

802
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:53,375
Vote for us!

803
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:56,666
-Don't forget to vote for us.
-Of course.

804
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:13,916
-Vote forâ€¦
-Coconut symbol!

805
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:39,083
-Our symbolâ€¦
-Coconut symbol!

806
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,458
-Our symbolâ€¦
-Coconut symbol!

807
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:42,166
-Vote forâ€¦
-Coconut!

808
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,500
-Our symbolâ€¦
-Coconut symbol!

809
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:45,083
-Vote forâ€¦
-<i>Idlis!</i>

810
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:46,625
-Vote forâ€¦
-<i>Chutney!</i>

811
00:48:46,708 --> 00:48:47,958
Vote forâ€¦

812
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:49,916
Coconut symbol!

813
00:48:51,166 --> 00:48:52,541
Stop, little ones.

814
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:12,500
We have 317 votes from the village.

815
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:13,916
Just 317?

816
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:15,375
Including new voters?

817
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:18,250
What about women
who married into our families?

818
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:19,708
I have taken account of everyone.

819
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:22,708
Some voters have moved out
and settled elsewhere.

820
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:24,833
And none of them
has come back to the village.

821
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:27,916
But I've spoken to them over phone.
They will definitely be here.

822
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:31,041
I'm working hard to ensure
we don't lose a single vote,

823
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:33,375
and you blindly trust them
to come here to vote for us?

824
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:35,458
-Let's drive down there.
-Okay.

825
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:51,166
-Vote forâ€¦
-Road Roller!

826
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:53,583
They've brought back voters from the city!

827
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,500
Don't we have voters
from outside the village?

828
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:58,041
No, we don't.

829
00:49:58,708 --> 00:50:00,291
Votes from outside the country?

830
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,791
Outside the countryâ€¦

831
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:06,250
{\an8}WELCOMING INTERNATIONAL VOTERS
OF SOUTH SOORANGUDI

832
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:09,000
-Is everyone here?
-Yes. He's the last one.

833
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,208
Welcome, mate!
Are you doing well?

834
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:15,458
You have come from
miles away to vote for me!

835
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:16,708
Vote for you?

836
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
You told me that my father was ill!

837
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:22,000
Well, he was in a critical conditionâ€¦

838
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:24,333
but when he got to know
that you'd be here to voteâ€¦

839
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:26,250
-he bounced back.
-What are you blabbering?

840
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:28,750
Nothing. Come on.
It's been ages since we met!

841
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:30,458
Let's go, buddy!

842
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:33,583
Hey, Jackass!
What took you so long? Hurry up!

843
00:50:37,833 --> 00:50:40,541
My name is not Jackass anymore.

844
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:41,708
It has been changed.

845
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,208
My name is Mandela.
Look at this.

846
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,708
He doesn't like being called Jackass.

847
00:50:45,791 --> 00:50:48,291
Why? Is the name Jackass
beneath you?

848
00:50:48,416 --> 00:50:49,416
Don't tell me what to call you.

849
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,166
Buzz off, Jackass!

850
00:50:58,833 --> 00:51:00,041
That's okay.

851
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:03,125
Since I have a foreign name,
she couldn't pronounce it.

852
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:06,041
Jackass!

853
00:51:06,583 --> 00:51:08,125
Be right there, Grandma!

854
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:16,583
Hey, buddy!
Let's go and put up some posters.

855
00:51:17,666 --> 00:51:19,125
Don't bother him.

856
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:22,875
He is upset because
his father was in a critical condition.

857
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:26,625
Take good care of him.
His vote is important!

858
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,958
Don't give me that look.
There are two voters in my family as well.

859
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:41,333
What if I forget to vote?
This will help me remember.

860
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:42,708
Am I right?

861
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,708
-What's the count?
-It's 340 for us.

862
00:51:49,791 --> 00:51:52,083
-Their count is 341.
-What are you saying?

863
00:51:52,166 --> 00:51:54,625
The Southerners are
leading by one vote.

864
00:51:54,916 --> 00:51:56,458
Don't worry, alright?

865
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:57,625
It's just one vote!

866
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,833
If we butcher a couple of Southerners,
we will take the lead.

867
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:02,333
Let's go, guys.

868
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:05,375
Do you think you'll kill their people
and they'll let it slide?

869
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,750
They'll kill four of our people!
We'll end up killing each other!

870
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,916
Don't you want us
to do anything about it?

871
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:16,000
There is a way.

872
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:31,125
The old hag's name is Mookaayi.
She's 90 years old.

873
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,833
Her life is hanging by a thread.

874
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,500
If we do away with her,
no one would doubt us.

875
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:38,666
-Who is at home with her?
-Just her grandson.

876
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:43,833
-What's that for?
-To kill the old lady.

877
00:52:43,916 --> 00:52:46,541
Put that away.
A loud yelp would finish her off.

878
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,041
Tighten it.

879
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:03,500
It keeps coming undone.

880
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:13,541
Catch him!

881
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:15,708
Don't let him get away!

882
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:18,250
-Stop!
-Don't spare him!

883
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:21,583
Where did he go?

884
00:53:22,916 --> 00:53:24,166
He got away!

885
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,958
Did you see that, old lady?
Your vote is in demand.

886
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:30,333
The pride of the Southerners
lies in your hands.

887
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:32,250
The election is just 28 days away.

888
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:35,166
Just hold onto your dear life
until then.

889
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,333
If you manage to cast your voteâ€¦

890
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:40,250
we will put up an idol of yours
next to our village deity.

891
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:41,958
Will you keep this in mind?

892
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:44,791
Will you vote correctly?

893
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,916
Tell me.
Who will you vote for?

894
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,250
M.G.R.

895
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,541
You old hag, it's been 30 years
since M.G.R. died!

896
00:53:57,625 --> 00:53:59,375
M.G.R. is dead?

897
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:04,000
Old lady?

898
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:07,375
Old lady?

899
00:54:07,916 --> 00:54:09,041
Old lady?

900
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:11,541
What happened?

901
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,666
We lost a vote.

902
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:16,333
Grandma!

903
00:54:16,416 --> 00:54:17,875
Grandma!

904
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:20,833
You've left me, Grandma!

905
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:24,125
I have no one left!

906
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:26,583
Grandma, I have nobody!

907
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:28,041
Grandmaâ€¦

908
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:30,041
You were always by my sideâ€¦

909
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:31,416
We need to find a vote.

910
00:54:31,791 --> 00:54:32,875
Find a vote?

911
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:34,791
Where will we find a vote?

912
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:37,833
Take me with you, Grandma!
Take me along!

913
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,750
It's bad enough
that we lost one voteâ€¦

914
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:43,041
-and you want her to take you with her!
-Hey!

915
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:44,833
Calm down!

916
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:47,208
We lost the lead, mate!

917
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:50,958
Now, we can win only if some
Northerner votes for us out of pity!

918
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:56,833
Hey, oldies! If any of you
bites the dust before the election,

919
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,458
there will be hell to pay.

920
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:07,750
Sudalaiâ€¦

921
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:15,875
So, you're one vote short.
Couldn't you find someone else?

922
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:17,666
There are other people in the village.

923
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,791
You are the only centrist
in North Soorangudi.

924
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:21,875
-Yeah, so?
-We appreciate your risk.

925
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:23,458
Just tell us your price.

926
00:55:23,541 --> 00:55:24,791
We have come prepared.

927
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:29,125
Please keep your money
and leave immediately.

928
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:32,541
If Kaalai sees me talking to
a Northerner during election timeâ€¦

929
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:34,208
You wretched jerks!

930
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:35,708
If you are short on votes,
then go die!

931
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:37,166
Why have you come here to beg?

932
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,500
Who is begging?

933
00:55:38,583 --> 00:55:40,375
We are paying him for his vote,
just like you.

934
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:41,583
Paying him?

935
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:44,375
No Northerner will vote for you
even if you write off all your assets.

936
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:45,416
Says who?

937
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,416
He agreed to vote
for us for 400 rupees.

938
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,916
But then you came and
spoiled the party. Let's go.

939
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,125
See you, brother.

940
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:56,541
We are working our asses off
to secure every single vote,

941
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:59,000
and you dared to sell
your vote for 400 rupees!

942
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:05,000
This is a warning to every Northerner!

943
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:08,250
If anybody among you dares
to vote for the Southerner,

944
00:56:08,458 --> 00:56:10,333
you will be dead meat!

945
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:17,208
If we let this slide,
they will try to buy everyone off.

946
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:21,083
We need to gain a lead at any cost.

947
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,916
What can we do?

948
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:32,416
There is a way.

949
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:41,750
A single vote is all they need.

950
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:43,666
Your vote is going to waste anyway.

951
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:45,458
Just give it to one of them.

952
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:52,583
You shameless oafs
are begging for votes!

953
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,583
Weâ€¦

954
00:57:13,666 --> 00:57:14,708
Butâ€¦

955
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:17,208
No, thanks!

956
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,375
We need only one vote.

957
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:24,375
Why should you beg him?
I'll cast one fake vote.

958
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,458
Would you let them cast fake votes?

959
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:28,458
No way!
I will scrutinize every vote.

960
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:30,250
Won't they do the same, you moron?

961
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:31,875
You, Northerners!

962
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:35,625
I'll pay one lakh for a vote.

963
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:38,041
Is there a real man among you

964
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:39,875
who'd vote for the Road Roller?

965
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:47,375
I'll give away half my wealth.

966
00:57:47,958 --> 00:57:51,833
Is any Southerner brave enough
to vote for the Coconut?

967
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:53,125
What is this?

968
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:56,791
Half his wealth, my ass!

969
00:57:58,125 --> 00:58:01,000
My mother shares a side
of her bed with your poor mother.

970
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:02,458
Won't I give half my wealth?

971
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:04,333
-You scumbag!
-Hey!

972
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:07,375
There's no point in talking
to these scoundrels!

973
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:10,666
Had we just killed some of them,
we would have been up by a few votes now!

974
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,250
Just say the word.

975
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:14,583
Go ahead. I dare you
to lay a hand on me.

976
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:16,458
-Is that a challenge?
-I dare youâ€¦

977
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:18,666
Only the ones alive
will have to vote.

978
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:58,250
All you people have gathered here!

979
00:58:58,375 --> 00:58:59,541
Is there a festival in town?

980
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:01,750
You'll be beaten to death.
Just go away!

981
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:03,541
That was uncalled for!

982
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:07,958
I just came here to deliver
a new voter ID issued to your villager.

983
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:09,875
-Voter ID?
-Yes.

984
00:59:10,916 --> 00:59:11,958
Here it is.

985
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:43,958
Is he a Northerner or a Southerner?

986
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:46,750
He isâ€¦ neither.

987
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,208
He's sort of neutral.

988
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:49,375
Neutral?

989
00:59:49,541 --> 00:59:51,458
How many such
neutral votes are left?

990
00:59:51,541 --> 00:59:53,458
We chased them all
out of the village.

991
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:55,458
He is the only one left.

992
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:57,708
His name was not
on the voter list you provided.

993
00:59:57,791 --> 01:00:00,458
Yes, but it's there
on the new voter list.

994
01:00:00,541 --> 01:00:03,291
I was on a pilgrimage,
so I couldn't give it to you sooner.

995
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:05,750
Do you know what we went through
for this one vote?

996
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:11,625
Superb!

997
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,500
-Just doing what I can to help.
-Great!

998
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,583
Wake him up.

999
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,666
This is the only voter left.
Don't stone him to death.

1000
01:00:30,916 --> 01:00:31,958
Drop it.

1001
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:34,041
Jackass!

1002
01:00:34,166 --> 01:00:36,166
-Hey, Jackass!
-His name is Mandela.

1003
01:00:36,291 --> 01:00:37,916
He doesn't like being called Jackass.

1004
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,416
Hey, shut up!

1005
01:00:39,958 --> 01:00:41,041
Jackass!

1006
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:42,375
Hey, Jackass!

1007
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:43,625
Mandela!

1008
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:50,541
Mr. Mandela!

1009
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:53,125
-Jackass!
-Shut up.

1010
01:00:56,416 --> 01:00:57,500
Mandela!

1011
01:00:58,166 --> 01:00:59,583
-Mandela!
-Mandela!

1012
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:01,333
-Mandela!
-Mr. Mandela!

1013
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:03,458
-Mandela! Mandela!
-Mr. Mandela!

1014
01:01:03,666 --> 01:01:06,208
-Mandela!
-Mandela!

1015
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:08,083
-Mandela!
-Mr. Mandela!

1016
01:01:08,291 --> 01:01:09,500
Mr. Mandela!

1017
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,708
-Mr. Mandela!
-Mandela!

1018
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:13,916
Mr. Mandela!

1019
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:16,250
-Mandela!
-Mr. Mandela!

1020
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:17,541
Mandela!

1021
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:19,208
Mr. Mandela!

1022
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,666
-Mandela, get down.
-Mr. Mandela!

1023
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,166
-Get down.
-Come.

1024
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:26,791
What are you doing?

1025
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:27,958
Jumping down.

1026
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:30,916
If you end up breaking your leg,
how will you vote?

1027
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,333
Make way for the car!

1028
01:01:36,416 --> 01:01:38,500
Keep going.

1029
01:01:43,291 --> 01:01:46,208
Mandela, step on the car
and get down.

1030
01:01:46,458 --> 01:01:49,000
That's okay, sir. I'll just jump
off the tree, like I always do.

1031
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:50,916
Just do as we say.
Get on the car.

1032
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:04,541
Be careful, man!

1033
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:07,125
It's okay. It's just a car.

1034
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:09,791
Get down, son.

1035
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,250
Are you okay?

1036
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:36,833
Yes.

1037
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:38,791
Did you apply for a voter ID?

1038
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:52,875
Why do you look dumbfounded?
This is you, right?

1039
01:02:53,291 --> 01:02:54,916
-That's not me.
-It's not you?

1040
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:58,583
This is your photo.

1041
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:00,125
The name says Nelson Mandela.

1042
01:03:00,416 --> 01:03:01,541
This isn't you?

1043
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:03,375
It's someone else who looks like me.

1044
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:05,291
-Someone else?
-What is he saying?

1045
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:07,291
It is him.

1046
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:14,500
Sir, I swearâ€¦ I just wanted to
deposit some money in the post office.

1047
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:17,208
It was Thenmozhi
who applied for these things.

1048
01:03:17,541 --> 01:03:20,083
I have nothing to do with this card.

1049
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:21,916
What's going on?

1050
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:24,708
Don't you believe me?
I will tear it--

1051
01:03:24,791 --> 01:03:26,791
-No, don't do that!
-No!

1052
01:03:27,208 --> 01:03:29,166
Get your hands off me!

1053
01:03:30,166 --> 01:03:31,541
-Don't tear it.
-Don't stop me!

1054
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:34,666
-We are glad you got a voter ID!
-Don't tear it!

1055
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:37,958
What's with him?

1056
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:40,750
You get to vote in this election.

1057
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:43,000
We are here to know
whom you'd be voting for.

1058
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:46,375
Who would stand in a queue
under the hot sun to cast a vote!

1059
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:47,708
How can you say that?

1060
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,541
Every citizen must vote.

1061
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,125
And you are a native of this village.

1062
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:52,250
You must vote!

1063
01:03:52,541 --> 01:03:53,666
-Is that so?
-Yeah!

1064
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:55,125
My symbol is Road Roller.

1065
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:56,500
My symbol is Coconut.

1066
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,750
Whom are you going to vote for?

1067
01:03:58,833 --> 01:04:00,500
What a question to ask!

1068
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:03,583
If I vote for one of you,
won't the other person feel bad?

1069
01:04:03,666 --> 01:04:05,208
I'll cast one vote each.

1070
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:07,083
You can vote for only one person.

1071
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:10,041
This is exactly why I said
I'm not going to vote!

1072
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:11,416
Let me rip that card to pieces.

1073
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,541
Don't get angry.

1074
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:15,583
Vote for whomever you think
will make a good leader.

1075
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,458
What does a good leader mean?

1076
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:19,083
A good leaderâ€¦

1077
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:22,250
Well, a leader isâ€¦

1078
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:23,375
Think.

1079
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:28,083
A good leader is someone
who understands your needs.

1080
01:04:28,166 --> 01:04:29,875
You tell me.
What are your needs?

1081
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:32,125
My needs are simple.

1082
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:34,125
I just want all of you
to grow a lot of hair

1083
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:36,625
so that I can always give you a haircut.
That's all I need.

1084
01:04:36,708 --> 01:04:39,083
How is that enough?
When are you going to make it big?

1085
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:40,625
Come here.

1086
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:44,083
-Where he is taking him?
-This is our salon!

1087
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:47,208
Look at this mirror.
The mercury has completely worn off.

1088
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:50,041
How will you make it big
with a mirror like this?

1089
01:04:51,625 --> 01:04:52,833
Kaalaiâ€¦

1090
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,875
Step aside.

1091
01:04:57,625 --> 01:04:58,750
Make way.

1092
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:13,750
A brand new mirror just for just shaving?

1093
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:15,500
It's the least I could do for you.

1094
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:17,000
Do you get it now?

1095
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:19,083
A good leader understands your needs.

1096
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,250
I get it.

1097
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,875
So, will you vote for me?

1098
01:05:21,958 --> 01:05:23,000
I will definitelyâ€¦

1099
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:24,708
Make way!

1100
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:34,125
Take that away.

1101
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:41,583
You look speechless.

1102
01:05:42,375 --> 01:05:44,291
Being able to see
their faces is not enough.

1103
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:47,416
A customer should have
a comfortable experience.

1104
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:49,791
-Try it out.
-It's okay, sir.

1105
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:51,125
Just sit!

1106
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:53,000
-Come on! Sit.
-Sirâ€¦

1107
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:54,791
Come on, sit.

1108
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:58,416
How is it?

1109
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:00,250
It's so comfortable!

1110
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:02,541
Tell us now,
who are you going to vote for?

1111
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:09,958
Wellâ€¦

1112
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:14,583
I can't decide.

1113
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:17,500
Stop treating him like an equal!

1114
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:18,916
He will vote as he is told.

1115
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,166
Our symbol is the Coconut.

1116
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,583
You will vote for it.

1117
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:24,958
-If you vote for someone elseâ€¦
-Hey!

1118
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:27,541
Did you just threaten him?

1119
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:29,791
Do you think
no one will stand up for him?

1120
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:31,333
Don't run your mouth!

1121
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:34,791
Who do you think he is?
Do you have any idea?

1122
01:06:34,916 --> 01:06:37,208
He is the one who toils
for the village.

1123
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:40,500
Should any harm befall him,
the Southerners will not spare you!

1124
01:06:41,375 --> 01:06:42,625
This is his vote.

1125
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:45,500
He should decide
whom he wants to vote for.

1126
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:49,041
You fool!
Is that how you speak to him?

1127
01:06:49,166 --> 01:06:50,416
He is one of our own.

1128
01:06:50,791 --> 01:06:52,625
Who else would he vote for if not us?

1129
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,458
Mandela, you need not
decide right away.

1130
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:57,041
The election is a month away.

1131
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:59,000
Take your time
and think this through.

1132
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:00,083
Okay?

1133
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:03,875
Let's go.

1134
01:07:07,875 --> 01:07:10,666
You must wear this on you
at all times.

1135
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,208
Keep it safe.

1136
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:15,750
How could he slap
his own brother-in-law?

1137
01:07:15,916 --> 01:07:17,166
What did you expect?

1138
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:20,708
The fate of this election
lies in Mandela's hands now.

1139
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,875
This vote is a real godsend.
We must not let it go.

1140
01:07:34,208 --> 01:07:37,000
One of our men should always
keep an eye on Smile.

1141
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:40,333
Whatever those people do,
we need to match them.

1142
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:52,416
Hey, look over there.

1143
01:07:56,458 --> 01:08:02,458
<i>His name is Mandela</i>

1144
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:10,458
<i>His name is Mandela</i>

1145
01:08:12,416 --> 01:08:18,458
<i>His name is Mandela</i>

1146
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:25,208
<i>His name is Mandela</i>

1147
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:26,375
Hello?

1148
01:08:28,458 --> 01:08:32,458
<i>Here comes the boss</i>
<i>Bearing bounty for a hobo</i>

1149
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:34,666
Will you vote for Coconut?

1150
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:39,500
<i>Your shop under the tree</i>
<i>Is now a salon with a seat</i>

1151
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:41,416
You'll vote for Road Roller, right?

1152
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,625
I can't decide.

1153
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:45,833
It's okay. Take your time.

1154
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:47,833
Let's go.

1155
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:54,083
<i>His name is Mandela</i>

1156
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:57,125
Cutting and shaving!

1157
01:08:57,541 --> 01:09:00,833
Cutting and shaving!

1158
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:06,541
Hey, Jackass! Get me groceries
from the ration store.

1159
01:09:07,166 --> 01:09:08,791
Who are you ordering around?

1160
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:12,416
What?

1161
01:09:17,666 --> 01:09:19,000
Give it to him.

1162
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:25,375
Side Burn, do you want to eat?

1163
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:27,875
I'd rather beg for alms than eat that.

1164
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:29,875
I'll take it.

1165
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:38,708
I've not made up my mind yet.

1166
01:09:40,416 --> 01:09:41,625
Let's go.

1167
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:48,666
<i>Yesterday, he was just Jackass</i>
<i>But now, he bathes and he is kickass</i>

1168
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:50,500
I couldn't decide.

1169
01:09:52,708 --> 01:09:53,708
I couldn't decide.

1170
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:57,875
<i>When he gives you a shave</i>
<i>Pay him in gold</i>

1171
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:07,333
Mandela!

1172
01:10:07,458 --> 01:10:09,416
<i>He's got the power</i>

1173
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:14,166
<i>Show him your voter's card</i>
<i>Are you a voting God?</i>

1174
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:17,375
Use the front door.

1175
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,666
-Haircut or a shave?
-As you please.

1176
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:33,083
<i>Here comes the chief</i>
<i>One must make his effigy</i>

1177
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:36,916
<i>Hoist the flag</i>
<i>Light up the fireworks!</i>

1178
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:40,541
<i>Greet him with applause</i>
<i>Sing laurels in his praise</i>

1179
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:44,291
<i>He's descended upon us</i>
<i>To save our nation's pride</i>

1180
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,750
{\an8}THE GEM OF OUR SOIL

1181
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:53,041
{\an8}THE SECRET OF OUR BEAUTY

1182
01:10:56,875 --> 01:10:58,458
He can't read!

1183
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:05,458
No, sir. It's not like that.

1184
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:08,750
I'm trying to connect the call,
but I can't get a signal.

1185
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:10,333
Yes, sir. I'm on the wayâ€¦

1186
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:11,875
Where are you going?

1187
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:14,500
If I don't attend this conference call,
they will fire me.

1188
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:16,291
Whatever!
Do it after the elections.

1189
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:17,583
-Go back.
-Go.

1190
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:20,333
Go on!

1191
01:11:22,666 --> 01:11:25,083
Mandela just won't
arrive at a decision.

1192
01:11:25,166 --> 01:11:26,750
I heard he listens to you.

1193
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:28,875
Make him vote for us.

1194
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:30,875
And I will give you your cut.

1195
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:32,083
Goodbye.

1196
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:37,958
What is all this?

1197
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,833
I got these for my vote.

1198
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:42,083
Did you work to earn this?

1199
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:43,375
These are just freebies.

1200
01:11:43,458 --> 01:11:44,875
Return all of it.

1201
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,041
Why should I?

1202
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:48,083
Everyone takes freebies.
I'm doing the same.

1203
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:49,375
I'm not giving it back.

1204
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:54,291
Side Burn, turn on the TV.

1205
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:57,000
Get lost.
I'm not touching your freebies.

1206
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:01,250
Smile!

1207
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,541
Smile!

1208
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:06,166
Come, let's go to work.

1209
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:15,583
I won't ask for much.
It's just 10 rupees.

1210
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:18,083
With one vote,
you entered through the front door.

1211
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:20,125
Next, you'll make
your bed in my house.

1212
01:12:20,375 --> 01:12:22,625
It's okay.
I can do it myself.

1213
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:30,708
Hey, Mandela!

1214
01:12:34,875 --> 01:12:37,125
The leader needs a shave.
Come home.

1215
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:51,541
I don't need it.
You can leave.

1216
01:12:51,916 --> 01:12:53,541
Then wash it off yourself.

1217
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:03,125
Where are you girls going?

1218
01:13:03,333 --> 01:13:04,541
We came to relieve ourselves.

1219
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:06,125
Not at this time.
Go back home.

1220
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:10,625
-This is Southern booze.
-This is Northern booze.

1221
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:13,416
Get drunk and make a sober decision!

1222
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:26,041
I've decided.

1223
01:13:27,291 --> 01:13:30,500
I've decided to drink only
imported booze from now.

1224
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:33,208
<i>We're all scoundrels here!</i>

1225
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:34,458
Hold tight!

1226
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:37,333
No matter what we give him,
he says he can't decide.

1227
01:13:37,583 --> 01:13:39,750
He knows everyone gets these freebies.

1228
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:43,458
He will be able to decide
only if we give him what he really needs.

1229
01:13:43,541 --> 01:13:45,958
Find out what he needs
and give it to him.

1230
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:48,958
Sir, do you need a shave?

1231
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:54,375
They will get it done on time.

1232
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:58,208
<i>From cutting and shaving under the tree</i>
<i>To a salon with a stylish chair</i>

1233
01:13:58,291 --> 01:14:02,291
<i>The small fish who went after the meat</i>
<i>Is now trapped in the net</i>

1234
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:03,916
Where are you going?

1235
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:05,875
I'm talking to you.

1236
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:08,708
What do you care?

1237
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:13,333
Go on! You will end up
coming back to me.

1238
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,041
Hey, Mandela!

1239
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:23,666
<i>His name is Mandela</i>

1240
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:28,916
Promise me that
you will vote for Coconut.

1241
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:33,541
-I promise--
-So, you have built a salon!

1242
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:35,625
Bring it in. Come on.

1243
01:14:35,791 --> 01:14:37,875
Watch it!
Don't hit the gentleman.

1244
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,166
Come on.

1245
01:14:54,416 --> 01:14:56,041
I swear, I can't decide.

1246
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:59,083
<i>His name is Mandela</i>

1247
01:15:02,791 --> 01:15:05,666
Cutting and shaving!

1248
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,041
Magesh?

1249
01:15:07,666 --> 01:15:08,791
Magesh!

1250
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:10,375
Do you want a haircut?

1251
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:14,291
How about an oil massage?

1252
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:15,708
No, thanks.

1253
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:20,000
No one is coming!

1254
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:22,125
Esaki, at least you come.

1255
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:25,500
I've opened a new salon.
No one has turned up all day.

1256
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:28,000
My hands are itching to work.

1257
01:15:28,416 --> 01:15:30,541
You need not pay. It's free.

1258
01:15:35,916 --> 01:15:38,166
BARBER SHOP
SOORANGUDI

1259
01:15:43,083 --> 01:15:45,250
Come out, Mandela!

1260
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:48,583
You think you're the only one
who gets to vote? Some vote!

1261
01:15:48,958 --> 01:15:50,083
Do our votes not count?

1262
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:51,708
What's your problem?

1263
01:15:51,791 --> 01:15:52,833
Welcome.

1264
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:57,375
We get a pittance of 20 rupees
for our votesâ€¦

1265
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:59,958
but he gets a new salon!

1266
01:16:00,041 --> 01:16:01,166
A new watch.

1267
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:03,125
He gets to eat
meat and rice every single day.

1268
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:04,666
I'm not going to vote either.

1269
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:07,250
I want all these things as well.

1270
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:09,500
I can't decide either.

1271
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:12,666
Our people are working so hard
to win the election,

1272
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:15,500
and you are causing trouble
instead of helping them?

1273
01:16:15,583 --> 01:16:17,041
Go home!

1274
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:20,125
You talk rubbish when you are drunk.

1275
01:16:24,791 --> 01:16:27,083
Thenmozhi, only you are ignoring me.

1276
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,833
Did you see how these people
stood up for me?

1277
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,041
You named me Mandela,
and it's gotten me so much respect.

1278
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:36,125
Oh! You thought this respect
was meant for you?

1279
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:38,125
It's meant for your vote.

1280
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:41,500
They will discard you
after the elections.

1281
01:16:41,583 --> 01:16:42,625
So what?

1282
01:16:43,125 --> 01:16:45,875
I will earn as much as I can
with my vote.

1283
01:16:46,125 --> 01:16:48,291
Do you know the value of a vote?

1284
01:16:48,375 --> 01:16:50,541
I know!
It's worth a salon.

1285
01:16:54,083 --> 01:16:57,458
You are taking money from both sides.
Who are you going to vote for?

1286
01:16:57,625 --> 01:16:59,500
You are too naive to know
how things work these days.

1287
01:16:59,583 --> 01:17:01,541
I will take handouts
from both the parties,

1288
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:04,833
and on the voting day,
I'll blindly vote for some party.

1289
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:09,000
How many times have you voted, sir?

1290
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:11,500
Never.

1291
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:13,416
Do you even know how to vote?

1292
01:17:13,958 --> 01:17:14,875
I don't know.

1293
01:17:14,958 --> 01:17:16,375
You don't know how to vote.

1294
01:17:16,458 --> 01:17:20,000
But you know everything
about making money with that vote!

1295
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:27,250
A fully grown adult, who doesn't
know to vote, sucking on a lollipop.

1296
01:17:27,458 --> 01:17:30,333
At least he told us now
that he doesn't know how to vote.

1297
01:17:30,708 --> 01:17:31,916
Mandela, come here.

1298
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:35,416
-Let's say he is the presiding officer.
-Hello, sir.

1299
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,208
If you show him your voter ID,

1300
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:39,166
he will verify your
name in the voter list,

1301
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:40,750
and send you ahead.

1302
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:43,666
He applies the ink.
Show him your hand.

1303
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:46,083
The other side up!

1304
01:17:46,666 --> 01:17:48,625
This is the most important stage.

1305
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,416
He will give you four chits of paper.

1306
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,458
Only one of these chits
is for the president.

1307
01:17:53,541 --> 01:17:57,166
You apply this seal on the symbol
you want to vote forâ€¦

1308
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:59,125
fold it up,
and drop it into that box.

1309
01:18:00,333 --> 01:18:01,708
-Is that all?
-Yes.

1310
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,625
Do people feel lazy just to do this?

1311
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:05,208
Indeed. What can I say?

1312
01:18:05,291 --> 01:18:06,416
Here, have a go.

1313
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:12,666
Are you trying to fool me?

1314
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:14,750
Why do you say that?

1315
01:18:14,875 --> 01:18:16,958
-You say only two people are contesting.
-Yes.

1316
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:19,333
But there is a third person.
He didn't give me any money!

1317
01:18:19,416 --> 01:18:20,541
A third person?

1318
01:18:22,208 --> 01:18:23,291
That is NOTA!

1319
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:25,625
I don't care who he is,
I'll vote only if I get paid.

1320
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:28,166
He can't come begging
to me on election day.

1321
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:29,750
Of course.
Go ahead.

1322
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:31,541
Who will he vote for?

1323
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:34,166
Road Roller, of course.

1324
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:45,791
Yeah, right!

1325
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:47,083
He is naive.

1326
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:50,250
And you are trying to trick him
into voting for Road Roller!

1327
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:51,416
Drag him in here.

1328
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,041
Why would we trick him?

1329
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:55,750
After all that we have done,
he will definitely vote for us.

1330
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:58,041
We have also done a lot for him!
His vote is ours.

1331
01:18:58,125 --> 01:18:59,291
We get his vote.

1332
01:18:59,375 --> 01:19:02,541
-Let go of him!
-Leave him!

1333
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:04,541
Esaki, grab him.
Secure our vote.

1334
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:06,583
How can you claim his vote?

1335
01:19:06,666 --> 01:19:08,083
Why, is it written?

1336
01:19:08,166 --> 01:19:09,750
Yes, it is written.

1337
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,208
What can you do?

1338
01:19:12,291 --> 01:19:15,250
This vote is ours.
Don't let him go.

1339
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,916
So, is he that "one vote"?

1340
01:19:46,541 --> 01:19:47,583
What is your name?

1341
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,250
-Mandela.
-What?

1342
01:19:50,458 --> 01:19:51,708
Nelson Mandela.

1343
01:19:52,333 --> 01:19:54,916
-Is he a foreigner?
-No, he is an Indian!

1344
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:56,500
It's a long story.

1345
01:19:57,666 --> 01:19:59,625
You say he isn't going to budge.

1346
01:20:00,041 --> 01:20:02,041
You have decided to spend for the vote.

1347
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,958
Why don't you conduct an auction?

1348
01:20:05,041 --> 01:20:06,458
An auction?

1349
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:09,250
Yes, auction his vote.

1350
01:20:09,416 --> 01:20:12,333
Whoever wins the bid
becomes the next president.

1351
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:16,208
The other person should
concede defeat, okay?

1352
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:18,291
What do you say?

1353
01:20:18,541 --> 01:20:20,041
Do you agree?

1354
01:20:22,791 --> 01:20:24,541
Isn't it against the law
to auction a vote?

1355
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:27,750
Sure! Like you are doing
everything else by the book.

1356
01:20:29,416 --> 01:20:32,083
What are you waiting for?
Get to work.

1357
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:34,041
-Okay.
-We'll take your leave.

1358
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:35,291
-See you.
-See you.

1359
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:38,541
Hey, Africa!

1360
01:20:39,458 --> 01:20:42,666
Take the money from the auction,
and vote without causing any trouble.

1361
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:44,041
-Understood?
-Yes.

1362
01:20:44,416 --> 01:20:45,458
Get going.

1363
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:48,500
Why are you dragging this out?

1364
01:20:48,833 --> 01:20:51,750
Just tell one of them not to contest,
end of story.

1365
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:56,375
You are only thinking
about the local election.

1366
01:20:56,458 --> 01:20:57,958
If we antagonize one group..

1367
01:20:58,416 --> 01:21:01,625
we will never get their community's votes
anywhere in the state.

1368
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:05,125
But in this case, we will get
the factory irrespective of who wins.

1369
01:21:05,375 --> 01:21:07,583
Let them fight among themselves.

1370
01:21:08,916 --> 01:21:11,458
Did Shanmugam bring in money?

1371
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:15,000
This should be enough.
I don't think they will bid higher.

1372
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:17,708
Here, take this too.

1373
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:19,041
What is this for?

1374
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:20,958
We saved this for the baby.

1375
01:21:21,041 --> 01:21:23,041
But the baby will be born a millionaire.

1376
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:25,708
I will invest whatever it takes
to get this done.

1377
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:29,208
While we are still trying
to work out the figures,

1378
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:31,083
she has it all figured out!

1379
01:21:34,041 --> 01:21:35,625
Why do you seem upset?

1380
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:37,458
We will definitely win.

1381
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:40,291
Even if we don't win,
we shouldn't let them win.

1382
01:21:40,625 --> 01:21:43,875
Despite that, if they end up
winning the auction--

1383
01:21:43,958 --> 01:21:45,375
They won't win!

1384
01:21:45,458 --> 01:21:46,583
Suppose if they winâ€¦

1385
01:21:46,791 --> 01:21:48,875
chop off Mandela's arm
after the auction.

1386
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:51,583
-Brother-in-lawâ€¦
-Won't you do it for our caste?

1387
01:21:52,125 --> 01:21:53,208
I will!

1388
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:04,583
-Really, an auction?
-Yes.

1389
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,666
What's that bag for?

1390
01:22:54,791 --> 01:22:58,208
I brought it to take my winnings
from the auction.

1391
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:01,291
Make way.

1392
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:03,250
Is everyone here?

1393
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:05,583
Hurry up, I need to go
to another auction after this.

1394
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:06,666
Lay it out.

1395
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:08,750
Let's get this over with.

1396
01:23:10,833 --> 01:23:12,333
Place the item on the table.

1397
01:23:12,916 --> 01:23:14,208
-Item?
-I don't knowâ€¦

1398
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:15,625
The item!

1399
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:19,041
You grab the other side.

1400
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:25,291
-What?
-The item for auction.

1401
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:26,750
You can't auction a person!

1402
01:23:26,833 --> 01:23:29,583
We don't want to auction him,
but his vote.

1403
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:31,250
-Auction his vote?
-Yes.

1404
01:23:31,416 --> 01:23:36,125
I'm here because the MLA wanted
a neutral party to hold the auction.

1405
01:23:36,208 --> 01:23:38,541
Are you trying to
land me in prison?

1406
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,500
This is not right.
I'm leaving.

1407
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:47,416
Boss, I've been here for four weeks now.

1408
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,875
They won't even let me
set foot outside the village.

1409
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:52,416
You've hardly been here for five minutes.
You think you can leave already?

1410
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,500
Go on. Get the auction going!

1411
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:04,125
I've never auctioned a vote till now.

1412
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:06,000
Fine, name your price.

1413
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,875
What is a good amount
for your vote?

1414
01:24:08,458 --> 01:24:09,791
Maybe 1000 rupees?

1415
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:11,875
2000 rupees?

1416
01:24:13,958 --> 01:24:15,041
Maybe 10,000 rupees.

1417
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:16,125
10,000 rupees?

1418
01:24:16,208 --> 01:24:19,208
People out there are desperate
to get 500 rupees for their votes,

1419
01:24:19,291 --> 01:24:20,833
and you want 10,000 rupees!

1420
01:24:20,916 --> 01:24:22,125
One lakh rupees!

1421
01:24:23,333 --> 01:24:24,833
One and a half lakh rupees!

1422
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:29,583
Who are you?

1423
01:24:29,875 --> 01:24:30,916
Mandela.

1424
01:24:31,416 --> 01:24:32,541
I run a salon.

1425
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:35,916
I can also give a good shave.

1426
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:37,958
Go away.

1427
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:41,958
One and a half lakhs
from the South.

1428
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:43,166
Two lakhs.

1429
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:45,416
Two lakhs from the North.

1430
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:48,583
Two lakhs, anybody?

1431
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:50,291
Two and a half lakhs.

1432
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:52,333
They are going to
chop off your arm!

1433
01:24:52,416 --> 01:24:54,833
-Two and a half lakhs from the South.
-My watch?

1434
01:24:54,916 --> 01:24:56,416
-I'll give you later
-Three lakhs.

1435
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,041
Three lakhs from the North.

1436
01:24:58,166 --> 01:25:01,083
The Northerners have
decided to chop off your arm

1437
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:03,000
if they lose the auction.

1438
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:05,500
-What are you saying?
-Look over there.

1439
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:07,250
Four lakhs.

1440
01:25:07,333 --> 01:25:08,875
-Four lakhs from--
-Five lakhs!

1441
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,916
These Northerners are despicable!

1442
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,625
I'm voting for Road Roller.

1443
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,208
It was their idea to
chop off your arm first.

1444
01:25:16,291 --> 01:25:17,625
Anyone raising?

1445
01:25:18,125 --> 01:25:19,541
Five lakhs from the South.

1446
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:22,166
-Six lakhs!
-What do we do?

1447
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:23,750
How would I know?

1448
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:26,041
I will figure something out.

1449
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,291
Just keep the auction going.

1450
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:31,958
Or you will have to give a shave
with a single arm.

1451
01:25:32,416 --> 01:25:33,958
Seven lakhs from North.

1452
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:35,875
Eight and a half lakh rupees.

1453
01:25:36,541 --> 01:25:38,375
Eight and a half lakh from the South.

1454
01:25:38,458 --> 01:25:40,166
North, are you going to raise?

1455
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:41,083
Nine lakhs.

1456
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:42,875
Nine lakhs from the North.

1457
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:43,916
Northâ€¦

1458
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,708
Hey! Where are you going?

1459
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:46,625
To pee.

1460
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:48,375
Wait till the auction is done.

1461
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:50,041
What's the tearing hurry?

1462
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,250
Seriously!

1463
01:25:51,875 --> 01:25:53,833
Take your time,
I'll be right here.

1464
01:25:53,916 --> 01:25:54,916
Be seated.

1465
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:56,625
Fifteen lakhs.

1466
01:25:56,708 --> 01:25:58,000
Fifteen lakhs from the South.

1467
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:03,291
Fifteen lakhs from the South.

1468
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:04,541
Anyone raising?

1469
01:26:05,041 --> 01:26:06,333
Seventeen lakhs!

1470
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,541
Seventeen lakhs from the North.

1471
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:11,041
Seventeen lakhs from the North.

1472
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:13,000
-Eighteen lakhs.
-Eighteen lakhs!

1473
01:26:13,791 --> 01:26:15,291
Eighteen lakhs from the South.

1474
01:26:15,708 --> 01:26:17,208
Eighteen lakhs from the South.

1475
01:26:17,458 --> 01:26:19,583
Hey! Why are you
dancing over there?

1476
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:22,125
Grooving about when
an auction's underway!

1477
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:23,583
He thinks I'm dancing?

1478
01:26:24,916 --> 01:26:27,000
-Continue.
-Eighteen lakhs from the South.

1479
01:26:27,083 --> 01:26:28,500
Eighteen lakhs from the South.

1480
01:26:28,625 --> 01:26:30,166
Twenty lakhs and eleven thousand.

1481
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:32,875
Twenty lakhs and eleven
thousand from the North.

1482
01:26:33,583 --> 01:26:34,833
Anyone raising?

1483
01:26:38,666 --> 01:26:39,916
Mandela, get that bell.

1484
01:26:42,875 --> 01:26:45,916
Twenty lakhs and eleven thousand
from the North, calling once.

1485
01:26:47,291 --> 01:26:49,583
Sir, they are auctioning Smile's vote.

1486
01:26:50,625 --> 01:26:51,708
They will never learn.

1487
01:26:51,791 --> 01:26:54,375
Twenty lakhs and eleven thousand
from the North, calling twice.

1488
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:57,583
Whoever loses the auction has decided
to chop off Smile's arm.

1489
01:27:00,583 --> 01:27:01,583
Sir?

1490
01:27:05,916 --> 01:27:06,916
Sir!

1491
01:27:07,625 --> 01:27:09,041
It will be over now.

1492
01:27:10,208 --> 01:27:11,791
Twenty lakhs and eleven thousandâ€¦

1493
01:27:12,375 --> 01:27:15,250
It can't be over.
You took the Southerners for misers?

1494
01:27:15,416 --> 01:27:17,958
If they lose this auction,
how will the village respect them?

1495
01:27:18,041 --> 01:27:20,666
The Southerners aren't suckers
to be defeated by the Northerners.

1496
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:22,500
-Am I right, bro?
-That's right.

1497
01:27:22,708 --> 01:27:24,583
Mathi, don't give up. Raise!

1498
01:27:28,375 --> 01:27:29,958
-Include that bungalowâ€¦
-Okay

1499
01:27:30,041 --> 01:27:31,333
Make way.

1500
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:35,208
A bungalow?

1501
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:37,916
A bungalow from the South.

1502
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,166
Thirty-five lakhs!

1503
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:44,041
Forty-five lakhs!

1504
01:27:44,625 --> 01:27:46,250
Forty-five lakhs from the North.

1505
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:49,833
Sixty lakhs!

1506
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:51,125
Sixty lakhs from the South.

1507
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:53,791
Sixty lakhs, calling once.

1508
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:56,458
Sixty lakhs, calling twice.

1509
01:27:56,875 --> 01:27:58,291
-Sixty lakhs--
-Sir, hold on.

1510
01:27:58,625 --> 01:28:01,041
Is that the best
the Northerners can do?

1511
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:02,791
I was going to vote for the North.

1512
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:04,833
If you want to save face,
raise the bid.

1513
01:28:04,916 --> 01:28:06,750
Our caste is not inferior to theirs!

1514
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,458
Raise the bid.
The North is counting on you.

1515
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:10,666
Raise it!

1516
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:13,291
How much have you got
in your pockets?

1517
01:28:14,666 --> 01:28:15,833
Two rupees.

1518
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:18,041
How much property has he declared?

1519
01:28:18,166 --> 01:28:19,166
Forty-five lakhs.

1520
01:28:20,083 --> 01:28:22,416
Think about why you don't have
the kind of money he does.

1521
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,000
This is not the time to think!

1522
01:28:24,708 --> 01:28:26,875
Our caste needs a win.
Raise it!

1523
01:28:37,291 --> 01:28:40,625
Your vote is worth upwards of a crore?

1524
01:28:41,791 --> 01:28:43,750
When you filed your nominations,

1525
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:47,125
you declared your assets as
50,000 rupees and a rickety old cycle!

1526
01:28:47,458 --> 01:28:49,750
But you are pouring in crores now!

1527
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:53,916
Now, it's one crore
and ten lakhs from the North,

1528
01:28:55,083 --> 01:28:57,833
and one crore and
twenty-five lakhs from the South.

1529
01:28:59,416 --> 01:29:02,583
One crore and twenty-five lakhs
from the South, going once.

1530
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:08,708
One crore and twenty-five lakhs
from the South, going twice.

1531
01:29:17,333 --> 01:29:19,875
One crore and twenty-five lakhs
from the South--

1532
01:29:19,958 --> 01:29:21,125
Stop!

1533
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:25,625
What?

1534
01:29:25,708 --> 01:29:26,583
The leaderâ€¦

1535
01:29:26,666 --> 01:29:28,041
What happened?

1536
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:29,375
He is dead.

1537
01:29:29,541 --> 01:29:30,625
He is dead?

1538
01:29:31,375 --> 01:29:32,458
What are you saying?

1539
01:29:32,541 --> 01:29:33,625
Oh, no!

1540
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,625
Start the car!

1541
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:39,458
Where are you going?

1542
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:40,583
To see the leader.

1543
01:29:40,791 --> 01:29:42,000
-Sir, what happened?
-Sir!

1544
01:29:42,083 --> 01:29:44,083
-Sir, we are here!
-Sir, what happened?

1545
01:29:44,208 --> 01:29:45,625
They are telling somethingâ€¦

1546
01:29:45,708 --> 01:29:47,250
-Are you okay?
-Sir.

1547
01:29:50,083 --> 01:29:51,500
He is still breathing.

1548
01:29:52,708 --> 01:29:54,666
-What did you say?
-I didn't understand.

1549
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:56,458
This is our chance.
Let's escape.

1550
01:29:56,541 --> 01:29:59,375
I must pay my respects to the leader!

1551
01:29:59,583 --> 01:30:01,541
You fool! He isn't dead.

1552
01:30:01,625 --> 01:30:02,708
I just bluffed.

1553
01:30:02,791 --> 01:30:03,958
Come with me if you want!

1554
01:30:04,041 --> 01:30:06,250
You bluffed? Wait!

1555
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:07,541
Sir?

1556
01:30:07,708 --> 01:30:08,625
Naggingâ€¦

1557
01:30:08,708 --> 01:30:10,625
He is nagging you?

1558
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:11,958
Can't understand, sir

1559
01:30:12,625 --> 01:30:13,583
Who?

1560
01:30:13,916 --> 01:30:14,875
Not me?

1561
01:30:14,958 --> 01:30:16,916
-Naggingâ€¦
-Who is nagging?

1562
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,041
What is he saying?

1563
01:30:18,166 --> 01:30:20,916
He wants to watch <i>Naagini</i> on TV.
Move aside.

1564
01:30:29,541 --> 01:30:31,541
-They tricked us!
-Start the car!

1565
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:33,416
Don't let those scoundrels
leave the village!

1566
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:34,583
Let's go.

1567
01:31:09,916 --> 01:31:11,708
Please wait for a moment, sir.

1568
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:13,958
Hurry up, man! Run faster!

1569
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:42,541
You thought you could run away
with all our money?

1570
01:31:42,708 --> 01:31:46,166
-It's my money!
-Spare him. He made a mistake.

1571
01:31:47,333 --> 01:31:50,583
-Mathi, don't spare him. Thrash him!
-Sir, please leave him.

1572
01:31:51,041 --> 01:31:52,625
Are you trying to flee the village?

1573
01:31:52,708 --> 01:31:55,125
He almost got away.
Beat him up!

1574
01:31:55,208 --> 01:31:57,625
-Lift him up.
-Beat him to death.

1575
01:31:59,666 --> 01:32:02,083
Sir, please stop them!

1576
01:32:02,166 --> 01:32:05,666
You are just a stray who eats our
leftovers. You made us touch your feet!

1577
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:11,625
I'm going to vote for NOTA.

1578
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:13,166
NOTA?

1579
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:15,750
If you vote for NOTA,
we will have a re-election.

1580
01:32:15,833 --> 01:32:17,916
We will make one of our men
contest again.

1581
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,625
You will be in the same situation.

1582
01:32:19,708 --> 01:32:22,333
How dare you take our money
and decide to vote for NOTA?

1583
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:25,208
-Hit him!
-You'll vote for NOTA!

1584
01:32:25,333 --> 01:32:26,666
Hit him on the face!

1585
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:31,333
Screw the auction.
We've given him enough.

1586
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:34,375
I need to know right now
which one of us he will vote for.

1587
01:32:34,625 --> 01:32:36,666
Who will you vote for? Tell me.

1588
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,458
-Answer me.
-Answer!

1589
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:41,666
Answer me!

1590
01:32:41,958 --> 01:32:43,250
I can't decide.

1591
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:44,583
Can't decide?

1592
01:32:44,666 --> 01:32:46,875
-Don't hit him.
-He has been saying this forever.

1593
01:32:46,958 --> 01:32:49,833
You gave him all those things
because you wanted his vote.

1594
01:32:49,916 --> 01:32:51,166
You dogs!

1595
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:53,250
Why are you hitting him now?
Let him go!

1596
01:32:53,875 --> 01:32:57,250
He won't respond to words.
I'll slaughter him right here.

1597
01:32:57,333 --> 01:32:58,375
Leave me

1598
01:32:58,625 --> 01:33:00,708
-Leave me!
-Calm down!

1599
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:04,625
What about all the money
we have already spent?

1600
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:08,666
Let's sort it out after the election.
Spare this scoundrel for now.

1601
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,666
Hey! You have two days.

1602
01:33:11,875 --> 01:33:15,083
Decide and tell us
who you are voting for.

1603
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:23,916
Didn't you say the leader died?

1604
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:52,666
Mandela?

1605
01:34:44,166 --> 01:34:45,375
Ignore him.

1606
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:14,541
Side Burnâ€¦

1607
01:35:16,625 --> 01:35:17,625
Side Burn!

1608
01:35:24,166 --> 01:35:25,041
Side Burn!

1609
01:35:29,583 --> 01:35:32,250
Hey! Side Burn!

1610
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:35,500
Side Burn!

1611
01:35:45,833 --> 01:35:48,375
-Sir, Side Burn is dying--
-Get off my stairs.

1612
01:35:50,333 --> 01:35:53,708
-Tell me.
-Side Burn is dying. Please save him.

1613
01:35:56,666 --> 01:35:58,791
Just come back inside!

1614
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Sirâ€¦

1615
01:36:02,416 --> 01:36:03,458
It's easy for you.

1616
01:36:03,541 --> 01:36:05,208
You make miracles happen
with that vote.

1617
01:36:05,291 --> 01:36:08,333
I'm sure you know how to
use your vote to save him.

1618
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:12,500
Sir!

1619
01:36:13,291 --> 01:36:14,541
Mr. Rathinam!

1620
01:36:15,791 --> 01:36:17,083
Please help me.

1621
01:36:18,250 --> 01:36:19,333
Sir!

1622
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,625
Side Burn is dying.
We need to take him to a hospital.

1623
01:36:26,708 --> 01:36:27,875
Please help me, sir.

1624
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:29,625
Who is that?

1625
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,958
The kid who said that the leader died?

1626
01:36:32,041 --> 01:36:33,250
Yes.

1627
01:36:34,666 --> 01:36:35,916
How old is he?

1628
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,041
He's 15 years old.

1629
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:39,458
So, he doesn't get to vote?

1630
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:42,458
Then why on earth
should we save him?

1631
01:36:42,541 --> 01:36:43,833
Please don't say that.

1632
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:46,291
I will do as you say.

1633
01:36:46,916 --> 01:36:48,375
Please save the kid, sir.

1634
01:36:48,458 --> 01:36:49,875
You would do anything I say?

1635
01:36:50,291 --> 01:36:52,750
I will, sir.
I will lay down my life for you.

1636
01:36:54,083 --> 01:36:55,666
I have no use for your life.

1637
01:36:56,333 --> 01:36:57,875
Will you vote for me?

1638
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:05,500
I will.

1639
01:37:05,583 --> 01:37:06,708
Save the kid.

1640
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:09,708
He can't be trusted.

1641
01:37:09,833 --> 01:37:12,708
He may go back on his word
and say he can't decide.

1642
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:15,041
Will you swear upon
your shaving kit?

1643
01:37:41,416 --> 01:37:42,333
Sir!

1644
01:37:43,625 --> 01:37:45,000
I swearâ€¦

1645
01:37:52,291 --> 01:37:54,083
I dare you to do that!

1646
01:37:54,291 --> 01:37:55,875
Do you take us for idiots?

1647
01:37:55,958 --> 01:37:58,416
He is trying to cut a deal
in the middle of the night!

1648
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:01,458
Sir, the boy is fighting for his life.

1649
01:38:01,541 --> 01:38:03,291
Can you take him to the hospital?

1650
01:38:03,958 --> 01:38:05,375
I will vote for you.

1651
01:38:09,625 --> 01:38:11,666
Taking him to the hospital
is no big deal.

1652
01:38:12,083 --> 01:38:14,708
But will you really vote for us?

1653
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:16,291
I will!

1654
01:38:17,541 --> 01:38:19,125
Take him to the hospital.

1655
01:38:19,208 --> 01:38:20,500
-I can--
-Fine!

1656
01:38:20,958 --> 01:38:24,166
I feel sorry for you.
I will save his life.

1657
01:38:27,083 --> 01:38:28,833
You will vote for me?

1658
01:38:29,625 --> 01:38:30,625
Definitely, sir!

1659
01:38:31,541 --> 01:38:33,708
You wouldn't vote for
Road Roller, right?

1660
01:38:35,583 --> 01:38:36,875
-I won't.
-Hey!

1661
01:38:37,166 --> 01:38:38,833
Do I look like a fool to you?

1662
01:38:39,666 --> 01:38:42,125
Don't let this scoundrel
set foot outside the village.

1663
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:45,041
If you promise to vote for them,

1664
01:38:45,333 --> 01:38:47,625
I'll make sure the boy doesn't live.

1665
01:38:47,958 --> 01:38:48,958
Let's go.

1666
01:38:53,166 --> 01:38:54,250
Mandela!

1667
01:38:54,333 --> 01:38:57,375
First, decide who gets your vote.

1668
01:38:57,541 --> 01:39:00,375
Then we can think about
saving a boy who can't even vote.

1669
01:39:00,583 --> 01:39:02,750
Sir, please help me.

1670
01:39:04,833 --> 01:39:05,958
Sir?

1671
01:39:11,166 --> 01:39:13,875
Sir, I hope at least you will help us.

1672
01:39:14,333 --> 01:39:15,416
Sir!

1673
01:39:16,875 --> 01:39:18,833
Sir, think of him like your son.

1674
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:21,458
He is fighting for his life.

1675
01:39:42,625 --> 01:39:44,083
Side Burn!

1676
01:40:02,041 --> 01:40:04,666
<i>Even when the days</i>

1677
01:40:05,916 --> 01:40:08,833
<i>Turn dark</i>

1678
01:40:10,083 --> 01:40:13,333
<i>Our dreams</i>

1679
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,416
<i>Can never be dark</i>

1680
01:40:17,958 --> 01:40:23,916
<i>Even when the wings are clipped</i>

1681
01:40:25,916 --> 01:40:28,666
<i>Our hearts will never shatter</i>

1682
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:30,083
Come here, quick!

1683
01:40:32,041 --> 01:40:33,250
Thenmozhi!

1684
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:35,666
<i>O Mandela!</i>

1685
01:40:37,666 --> 01:40:42,041
<i>Like a shining light on dark days</i>

1686
01:40:42,125 --> 01:40:45,500
<i>O Mandela!</i>

1687
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,791
<i>Like a ray of hope for shattered hearts</i>

1688
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,250
<i>O Mandela!</i>

1689
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,750
<i>Like a rising tide</i>

1690
01:40:57,833 --> 01:41:00,083
<i>O Mandela!</i>

1691
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,416
<i>Like a shift in direction</i>

1692
01:41:05,625 --> 01:41:08,041
<i>O Mandela!</i>

1693
01:41:09,666 --> 01:41:13,000
<i>Like a shining light on dark days</i>

1694
01:41:13,083 --> 01:41:16,708
She won't help him for nothing.
He must have promised her a share.

1695
01:41:17,416 --> 01:41:20,250
Or why would anyone be
associated with someone like him?

1696
01:41:20,333 --> 01:41:22,333
Whatever!
What do we care?

1697
01:41:22,416 --> 01:41:25,250
<i>O Mandela!</i>

1698
01:41:26,083 --> 01:41:29,375
<i>The rising tide</i>

1699
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:31,750
Thenmozhi, how is he?

1700
01:41:32,708 --> 01:41:34,416
Have you admitted him in a hospital?

1701
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,041
What did the doctor say?

1702
01:41:37,291 --> 01:41:38,500
Will he be alright?

1703
01:41:40,083 --> 01:41:42,416
Thenmozhi, I am talking to you.

1704
01:41:46,458 --> 01:41:48,375
I'm talking to you,
why won't you answer?

1705
01:41:48,458 --> 01:41:50,500
Why should I answer?

1706
01:41:50,625 --> 01:41:53,208
You didn't just ruin your life
with your one vote.

1707
01:41:53,291 --> 01:41:54,958
You also ruined Side Burn's life!

1708
01:41:55,041 --> 01:41:57,708
I'm ashamed to have named
a man like you after Mandela!

1709
01:41:58,583 --> 01:42:00,708
Why are you even alive,
you wretched man?

1710
01:42:01,083 --> 01:42:02,583
Just go and die!

1711
01:42:02,708 --> 01:42:04,125
Rid us of that one vote.

1712
01:42:04,208 --> 01:42:08,166
<i>Mandela!</i>

1713
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:13,500
Not just shaving.
I will do any work you give me.

1714
01:42:13,666 --> 01:42:16,000
The villagers have decided
not to give you any work.

1715
01:42:16,083 --> 01:42:18,208
I can't defy their orders.

1716
01:42:23,708 --> 01:42:25,000
Grandma!

1717
01:42:26,041 --> 01:42:27,375
-Give that to me.
-No, thanks.

1718
01:42:27,458 --> 01:42:30,333
I will get into trouble
if I'm seen taking your help.

1719
01:42:30,541 --> 01:42:31,875
I'll carry it myself.

1720
01:43:01,916 --> 01:43:04,541
<i>I'm ashamed to have named</i>
<i>a man like you after Mandela!</i>

1721
01:43:10,833 --> 01:43:12,583
<i>Why are you alive,</i>
<i>you wretched man?</i>

1722
01:43:13,333 --> 01:43:16,833
<i>You should die!</i>
<i>Rid us of that one vote.</i>

1723
01:43:46,625 --> 01:43:47,916
Who's there?

1724
01:43:51,458 --> 01:43:52,666
Who is it?

1725
01:43:53,666 --> 01:43:54,791
I'm talking to you.

1726
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:59,500
Don't come any closer.

1727
01:44:00,416 --> 01:44:03,250
-Who are you?
-I am Vairamuthu, from the North.

1728
01:44:03,333 --> 01:44:06,375
-What are you doing here?
-I came here to relieve myself.

1729
01:44:07,958 --> 01:44:09,291
At this hour?

1730
01:44:09,583 --> 01:44:12,375
I can't come here after dawn
because the men would be here.

1731
01:44:12,458 --> 01:44:14,166
So, I wake up at 3 a.m.
to relieve myself.

1732
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:16,708
But you shouldn't venture out
into the woods at this late hour.

1733
01:44:16,791 --> 01:44:19,750
It's not just me.
This is what all the women do.

1734
01:44:20,583 --> 01:44:22,333
They demolished that toilet as well.

1735
01:44:22,416 --> 01:44:23,833
Where else can we go?

1736
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:28,625
Brother?

1737
01:44:29,333 --> 01:44:31,000
With that vote of yoursâ€¦

1738
01:44:31,458 --> 01:44:36,291
could you prevent men
from coming here to drink at night?

1739
01:45:14,625 --> 01:45:15,791
What is it?

1740
01:45:17,291 --> 01:45:20,166
-Do you want my vote?
-I do.

1741
01:45:20,250 --> 01:45:22,875
I'm finding it hard
to go to the toilet in the woods.

1742
01:45:22,958 --> 01:45:25,666
Rebuild the toilet that you demolished,

1743
01:45:25,916 --> 01:45:27,416
and I will vote for you.

1744
01:45:36,375 --> 01:45:38,625
You think you are some hero
to order me around?

1745
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:40,041
Don't mess with me. Go away.

1746
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:42,708
Fine, forget it.
I will relieve myself in your house.

1747
01:45:46,041 --> 01:45:47,791
Don't hit him!

1748
01:45:47,916 --> 01:45:49,583
Mathi, don't hit him.

1749
01:45:51,041 --> 01:45:51,875
Get off him.

1750
01:45:51,958 --> 01:45:53,083
Listen to me.

1751
01:45:53,208 --> 01:45:54,708
Mathi, don't!

1752
01:45:55,041 --> 01:45:57,416
Stop hitting him!

1753
01:45:58,458 --> 01:45:59,791
Listen to me.

1754
01:46:00,041 --> 01:46:02,000
You are just a stray
who shits where you eat!

1755
01:46:02,083 --> 01:46:03,541
And you want to shit in my house?

1756
01:46:03,625 --> 01:46:04,708
Calm down!

1757
01:46:04,916 --> 01:46:07,875
Leave him alone!
He will die!

1758
01:46:08,958 --> 01:46:11,875
I ran behind this scoundrel
just for the five crores!

1759
01:46:11,958 --> 01:46:13,666
Don't talk nonsense now.

1760
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:14,833
Go away.

1761
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:21,458
Don't think you can order him around.

1762
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,416
He will kill you!

1763
01:46:26,458 --> 01:46:28,625
Can't shit unless you have a toilet?

1764
01:46:34,083 --> 01:46:36,625
Don't give that pest any food or water.

1765
01:46:38,333 --> 01:46:40,375
Keep him locked up here
until the elections.

1766
01:46:56,458 --> 01:46:59,166
Let's give him some water at least.
He might die.

1767
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:20,541
Did you beat up that African boy?

1768
01:47:20,625 --> 01:47:22,250
I stopped at Rathinam's place.

1769
01:47:22,333 --> 01:47:23,791
We just shoved him about.

1770
01:47:23,916 --> 01:47:25,416
Shoved him?

1771
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,500
What happens if he dies
before the election?

1772
01:47:29,125 --> 01:47:30,291
Let him die.

1773
01:47:30,458 --> 01:47:31,750
What are you saying?

1774
01:47:31,875 --> 01:47:35,208
Whoever wins the elections
will get crores from the company.

1775
01:47:35,291 --> 01:47:38,250
I don't care about the five crores.
I can't beg that scoundrel.

1776
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:40,208
They are willing to pay 30 crores!

1777
01:47:42,375 --> 01:47:44,958
-Thirty crores?
-Yes, thirty crores!

1778
01:47:45,666 --> 01:47:48,916
Beg that African, do whatever it takes,
and make him vote for you!

1779
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,791
You can't lay a finger on him
till the elections.

1780
01:47:52,875 --> 01:47:54,041
That's a warning.

1781
01:47:54,125 --> 01:47:55,166
Let's go.

1782
01:48:00,416 --> 01:48:02,125
God, I hope he is not dead.

1783
01:48:21,583 --> 01:48:23,916
Son, pick that up.

1784
01:48:25,875 --> 01:48:27,541
It's worth 30 crores.

1785
01:48:28,916 --> 01:48:29,916
Take it, man.

1786
01:48:37,791 --> 01:48:39,250
Where were we?

1787
01:48:39,625 --> 01:48:41,083
-The toilet.
-Yes.

1788
01:48:42,625 --> 01:48:44,833
I'm finding it hard
to go in the woods.

1789
01:48:45,333 --> 01:48:47,708
Rebuild the toilet you demolished.

1790
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:52,041
If you don't want to,
that's okay.

1791
01:48:53,375 --> 01:48:54,708
Rathinam!

1792
01:48:54,875 --> 01:48:56,541
I have a vote.
Do you want it?

1793
01:48:56,625 --> 01:48:57,708
I'll rebuild it.

1794
01:49:03,208 --> 01:49:04,291
Alright!

1795
01:49:26,625 --> 01:49:28,041
Everybody will get to use it.

1796
01:49:33,375 --> 01:49:34,666
Hurry up.

1797
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,500
Grind the cement properly.

1798
01:49:43,416 --> 01:49:44,833
Or he will make us rebuild it.

1799
01:49:44,916 --> 01:49:47,541
He knows about the 30 crores.

1800
01:49:47,625 --> 01:49:49,791
That's why they are
dancing to his tunes.

1801
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:51,916
If he knows we are in it
for the money,

1802
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,250
he won't obey us anymore.

1803
01:49:54,916 --> 01:49:57,625
If he tries to walk over us,
we should walk over him.

1804
01:49:58,125 --> 01:49:59,375
Or he won't budge.

1805
01:50:14,291 --> 01:50:16,166
Is it burning?

1806
01:50:16,791 --> 01:50:18,541
A low-born who doesn't even
know his own name!

1807
01:50:18,625 --> 01:50:22,166
We burned on the inside
when you made us run behind you!

1808
01:50:22,583 --> 01:50:25,208
The Southerners have no pride,
so they just played along.

1809
01:50:25,291 --> 01:50:27,541
But don't try to get cocky
with a Northerner,

1810
01:50:27,625 --> 01:50:28,916
or you will get burnt!

1811
01:50:29,416 --> 01:50:31,416
It's very simple.
You will vote for us.

1812
01:50:31,916 --> 01:50:33,083
How will I vote now?

1813
01:50:33,166 --> 01:50:35,208
-Why?
-My voter ID is inside.

1814
01:50:39,916 --> 01:50:42,000
Kaalai, get some water!

1815
01:50:42,541 --> 01:50:44,041
Quick, get some water.

1816
01:50:44,916 --> 01:50:48,041
Hurry up! It's burning.
Check the other side.

1817
01:50:49,708 --> 01:50:52,000
-Thirty crores!
-Pour some water from that side.

1818
01:50:52,083 --> 01:50:53,583
Pour some up there!

1819
01:50:54,083 --> 01:50:55,791
Look for the card.

1820
01:50:57,416 --> 01:50:58,666
Is it there?

1821
01:51:01,041 --> 01:51:02,333
I hope it's not burnt.

1822
01:51:03,250 --> 01:51:04,208
It's not in there.

1823
01:51:04,291 --> 01:51:07,458
Just kidding.
I got it right here.

1824
01:51:07,541 --> 01:51:10,041
Are you screwing with us?
I'll slit your throat!

1825
01:51:10,125 --> 01:51:11,291
I dare you to do it.

1826
01:51:11,416 --> 01:51:12,458
I dare you!

1827
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:14,375
If you kill me, who will
cast that swing vote?

1828
01:51:14,458 --> 01:51:15,625
Tell me.

1829
01:51:17,791 --> 01:51:19,250
You want my vote, right?

1830
01:51:21,125 --> 01:51:23,041
Build me a swimming pool,
I'll vote for you.

1831
01:51:23,125 --> 01:51:24,208
A swimming pool?

1832
01:51:24,875 --> 01:51:27,291
People don't even have water
to wash their asses.

1833
01:51:27,541 --> 01:51:29,500
Build it, and you get my vote.

1834
01:51:29,583 --> 01:51:31,750
We can't build a swimming pool
in the village.

1835
01:51:33,291 --> 01:51:35,291
You know the old water tank
in the village?

1836
01:51:35,375 --> 01:51:39,083
Clean it up and fill it with water.
I'll take a dip in it.

1837
01:51:39,375 --> 01:51:41,250
If you don'tâ€¦

1838
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,333
Get in! It's getting late.

1839
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,041
-I'm not in the mood.
-Not in the mood?

1840
01:52:03,458 --> 01:52:05,750
We worked so hard
to fill the tank with water!

1841
01:52:05,833 --> 01:52:07,666
What do we do with the water now?

1842
01:52:14,291 --> 01:52:15,333
Open the pipeline.

1843
01:52:15,416 --> 01:52:18,416
Fill it up with water every day.
I'll shower when I feel like it.

1844
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:21,833
<i>Mic testing! One, two, three!</i>

1845
01:52:21,916 --> 01:52:25,000
<i>I have something to say to thee</i>

1846
01:52:25,208 --> 01:52:28,250
<i>It's happening, it's coming true</i>

1847
01:52:28,333 --> 01:52:31,250
<i>All our dreams are taking shape</i>

1848
01:52:31,833 --> 01:52:35,833
Great! As though re-building the toilet
will make these people cultured.

1849
01:52:36,125 --> 01:52:38,416
Why should we pay to build
a toilet for the Northerners?

1850
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:41,500
This is common property.
Southerners can also use it.

1851
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:44,250
I would rather die than
use a Northerner's toilet.

1852
01:52:46,166 --> 01:52:47,458
He is a proud man.

1853
01:52:47,583 --> 01:52:50,416
<i>Think before you cast your vote</i>

1854
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:53,916
<i>Gotta make it happen</i>
<i>Let's wreak havoc</i>

1855
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,000
<i>If it doesn't work out</i>
<i>We must set it right</i>

1856
01:52:57,125 --> 01:52:59,916
<i>There's a hullabaloo</i>
<i>Just for one man's vote</i>

1857
01:53:00,083 --> 01:53:03,208
<i>Everyone's dancing to his tunes</i>

1858
01:53:03,458 --> 01:53:06,291
<i>When the saboteurs come</i>

1859
01:53:06,666 --> 01:53:08,958
<i>Close the gates shut!</i>

1860
01:53:09,583 --> 01:53:12,458
I've always wished
to study in a school.

1861
01:53:12,625 --> 01:53:14,208
You'll probably be dead in 20 days.

1862
01:53:14,291 --> 01:53:16,500
Do you plan on
becoming a scholar by then?

1863
01:53:16,625 --> 01:53:17,750
Don't give him ideas.

1864
01:53:17,833 --> 01:53:21,333
Or he will demand that we make him
a scholar, in exchange for his vote.

1865
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:24,958
Make me a scholar.
I will vote for you.

1866
01:53:28,166 --> 01:53:29,583
Fix the school building.

1867
01:53:49,625 --> 01:53:51,125
What about the money you owe me?

1868
01:53:51,458 --> 01:53:52,666
No, thanks.

1869
01:53:56,541 --> 01:53:57,833
Fifty rupees.

1870
01:54:10,875 --> 01:54:12,416
Thirty rupees.

1871
01:54:12,541 --> 01:54:14,166
Only Side Burn's money is left.

1872
01:54:15,041 --> 01:54:16,250
No need.

1873
01:54:25,916 --> 01:54:27,958
Stop, it hurts. I'll walk.

1874
01:54:33,625 --> 01:54:36,458
At this rate, we may have to
shut down our company.

1875
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:48,666
You don't get it?

1876
01:54:48,750 --> 01:54:51,375
He says he will vote for Road Roller
if you don't lay new roads.

1877
01:54:51,458 --> 01:54:54,416
<i>There's a hullabaloo</i>
<i>Just for one man's vote</i>

1878
01:54:54,541 --> 01:54:56,750
<i>Everyone's dancing to his tunes</i>

1879
01:54:56,833 --> 01:54:58,750
Are you sure we'll get 30 crores?

1880
01:54:58,958 --> 01:55:00,666
We must win at any cost!

1881
01:55:01,916 --> 01:55:05,583
Great! As though re-building the school
will turn these people into geniuses.

1882
01:55:09,041 --> 01:55:10,500
I've been watching you.

1883
01:55:10,583 --> 01:55:13,083
You just go around brushing your teeth
and passing comments.

1884
01:55:13,166 --> 01:55:14,833
Are you a Northerner or a Southerner?

1885
01:55:14,916 --> 01:55:17,541
I'm from the neighboring village.
I come here to kill time.

1886
01:55:17,625 --> 01:55:20,791
If I ever see you in Soorangudi again,
I will chop your nose off.

1887
01:55:20,875 --> 01:55:22,541
Now, scram!

1888
01:55:29,833 --> 01:55:34,375
<i>The young ones have matured</i>
<i>And come together</i>

1889
01:55:35,166 --> 01:55:37,500
Get in.
Don't stand near the door.

1890
01:55:37,583 --> 01:55:40,958
<i>The old codes have been discarded</i>
<i>As invalid for our times</i>

1891
01:55:42,666 --> 01:55:48,541
<i>We will beg and plead for five years</i>
<i>When will we stand tall and survive?</i>

1892
01:55:48,875 --> 01:55:53,458
<i>Think for everyone</i>
<i>Fight for your descendants</i>

1893
01:55:53,625 --> 01:55:55,375
Study well, son.

1894
01:55:55,458 --> 01:55:58,583
<i>Gotta make it last</i>
<i>Gotta stay strong</i>

1895
01:55:58,708 --> 01:56:02,083
You have to give them credit!
The roads are so shiny.

1896
01:56:02,416 --> 01:56:04,083
Thank God he didn't come to us!

1897
01:56:04,583 --> 01:56:06,000
Stop!

1898
01:56:10,333 --> 01:56:12,833
Why would you stand
in the middle of the road?

1899
01:56:13,208 --> 01:56:14,708
What if a car had run you over?

1900
01:56:14,791 --> 01:56:16,208
You would have lost my vote.

1901
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:20,375
Install streetlamps on all the roads.

1902
01:56:22,250 --> 01:56:24,333
Our things are being removed
from the bar.

1903
01:56:24,416 --> 01:56:26,541
Just need to hand over the keys.

1904
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:28,333
A little higher.

1905
01:56:30,333 --> 01:56:33,125
You've been at it all day.
We have barely covered four streets.

1906
01:56:33,416 --> 01:56:34,500
Hurry up!

1907
01:57:16,208 --> 01:57:17,250
Here.

1908
01:57:25,208 --> 01:57:26,458
Give me two buns.

1909
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:51,416
<i>In 20 districts including</i>
<i>Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Madurai</i>

1910
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:55,541
<i>village local body elections</i>
<i>begin tomorrow.</i>

1911
01:57:55,625 --> 01:57:57,375
This is the last of my money.

1912
01:57:58,583 --> 01:58:00,500
We can use this
to pay for the votes.

1913
01:58:01,458 --> 01:58:03,333
But I have no money left.

1914
01:58:04,416 --> 01:58:06,708
If Mandela doesn't vote for us,

1915
01:58:07,250 --> 01:58:09,708
I will kill him
with my bare hands.

1916
01:58:27,666 --> 01:58:29,166
Go inside.

1917
01:58:36,833 --> 01:58:38,541
-Welcome, brother.
-Greetings.

1918
01:58:58,791 --> 01:58:59,875
Is everything okay?

1919
01:58:59,958 --> 01:59:01,333
The leader hasn't come?

1920
01:59:03,083 --> 01:59:04,208
No.

1921
01:59:17,625 --> 01:59:18,875
What are you doing?

1922
01:59:19,541 --> 01:59:20,916
I was just looking at it.

1923
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,458
Keep it safe in your pocket.
2,000 rupees for a vote isn't nothing!

1924
01:59:24,541 --> 01:59:25,708
Hurry up.

1925
01:59:45,875 --> 01:59:47,000
Get in.

1926
01:59:57,333 --> 01:59:59,083
-Why are we stopping here?
-Wait

1927
01:59:59,208 --> 02:00:00,500
Where are you going?

1928
02:00:02,708 --> 02:00:04,083
What's with this guy?

1929
02:00:13,916 --> 02:00:16,375
Hey, what are you doing?

1930
02:00:16,458 --> 02:00:17,791
Have you gone mad?

1931
02:00:17,875 --> 02:00:21,791
Every single person in the village
will bring their 20 rupee token.

1932
02:00:21,875 --> 02:00:24,750
We will be the only ones
turning up empty handed.

1933
02:00:39,250 --> 02:00:40,125
Stop.

1934
02:00:41,708 --> 02:00:43,083
Have you made up your mind?

1935
02:00:45,166 --> 02:00:47,458
I will forgive everything
you have done.

1936
02:00:47,541 --> 02:00:49,541
Give me your word
that you'll vote for me.

1937
02:00:49,625 --> 02:00:51,666
I'll get you a good job in Singapore.

1938
02:00:51,833 --> 02:00:53,041
What do you say?

1939
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:54,916
You don't need to go to Singapore.

1940
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,541
Promise me that you will
vote for Coconut,

1941
02:00:56,625 --> 02:00:58,625
and you will become
a Northerner right away.

1942
02:00:59,958 --> 02:01:03,666
Mandela, your life and death
are in your own hands.

1943
02:01:04,625 --> 02:01:05,541
Tell me.

1944
02:01:05,625 --> 02:01:07,208
Who will you vote for?

1945
02:01:07,625 --> 02:01:08,750
Answer me!

1946
02:01:12,875 --> 02:01:14,208
It is my vote.

1947
02:01:15,166 --> 02:01:17,125
I get to decide
whom I want to vote for.

1948
02:01:18,375 --> 02:01:19,750
Get out of my way.

1949
02:01:32,250 --> 02:01:33,375
What is your name?

1950
02:01:33,458 --> 02:01:34,708
Nelson Mandela.

1951
02:01:36,666 --> 02:01:38,708
Sir, this ID looks suspicious.

1952
02:01:40,333 --> 02:01:43,458
His name on the card
is Nelson Mandela.

1953
02:01:43,541 --> 02:01:47,416
The man himself looks suspicious.

1954
02:01:47,541 --> 02:01:51,125
You have no idea about
the drama behind this one guy's vote.

1955
02:01:51,208 --> 02:01:53,791
If he doesn't vote,
there will be hell to pay.

1956
02:01:54,041 --> 02:01:56,500
-Can we send him ahead?
-Please do.

1957
02:01:56,583 --> 02:01:57,666
Here.

1958
02:02:02,666 --> 02:02:05,875
Sir, that finger is injured.
Apply the ink on the other finger.

1959
02:02:19,708 --> 02:02:22,333
Step aside, everyone.
Please don't stand at the door.

1960
02:02:37,375 --> 02:02:38,500
Come here.

1961
02:02:38,625 --> 02:02:39,875
You scoundrel!

1962
02:02:40,458 --> 02:02:42,083
Who did you vote for?

1963
02:02:43,833 --> 02:02:44,958
Answer me!

1964
02:02:48,125 --> 02:02:49,625
I voted for M.G.R.

1965
02:02:50,041 --> 02:02:51,000
Calm down!

1966
02:02:51,083 --> 02:02:54,000
You can see for yourself
when the results are out tomorrow.

1967
02:02:54,291 --> 02:02:55,583
Why are you crowding there?

1968
02:02:55,666 --> 02:02:57,166
You can't be here. Go away!

1969
02:02:58,291 --> 02:03:00,083
How do I know
that you actually voted?

1970
02:03:17,333 --> 02:03:18,541
I told you!

1971
02:03:18,666 --> 02:03:20,875
Everyone has brought
their 20 rupee token.

1972
02:03:21,125 --> 02:03:22,333
These are your people.

1973
02:03:22,416 --> 02:03:25,291
Tell them you lost the token,
and try to get 2,000 rupees.

1974
02:03:25,375 --> 02:03:26,291
One by one.

1975
02:03:26,375 --> 02:03:27,375
Shut up!

1976
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:28,833
Are you coming or not?

1977
02:03:30,916 --> 02:03:32,166
-Hello!
-Brotherâ€¦

1978
02:03:32,250 --> 02:03:34,166
-Have you voted?
-Yes, brother.

1979
02:03:36,875 --> 02:03:38,333
-Here.
-I don't want it.

1980
02:03:38,416 --> 02:03:39,875
I voted for you.

1981
02:03:40,083 --> 02:03:41,833
Then why did you bring the token?

1982
02:03:41,916 --> 02:03:45,625
The 20 rupees belongs to you,
so I came to return it.

1983
02:03:45,708 --> 02:03:46,750
I'll see you.

1984
02:03:47,083 --> 02:03:48,000
Brother.

1985
02:03:49,125 --> 02:03:51,250
My son is getting an education
because of this vote.

1986
02:03:51,333 --> 02:03:53,500
It feels wrong to take money.

1987
02:03:56,125 --> 02:03:57,291
Leave it there.

1988
02:04:02,875 --> 02:04:04,083
Murugesan!

1989
02:04:05,375 --> 02:04:06,541
I have voted, brother.

1990
02:04:06,625 --> 02:04:08,250
But I don't want the money.

1991
02:04:08,625 --> 02:04:10,250
I have voted.
I don't want the money.

1992
02:04:10,333 --> 02:04:11,916
Here is your 20 rupees.

1993
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,208
With 20 rupees, you got
the entire village to vote!

1994
02:04:14,291 --> 02:04:15,875
Are you happy now?
Go on.

1995
02:04:15,958 --> 02:04:17,500
Here's your 20 rupees.

1996
02:04:18,166 --> 02:04:19,500
Esaki!

1997
02:04:19,875 --> 02:04:21,375
-Your money?
-No, thanks.

1998
02:04:41,416 --> 02:04:43,333
Where is Rathinam's house?

1999
02:04:43,583 --> 02:04:45,416
The third street down this road.

2000
02:04:56,750 --> 02:04:58,375
Kill him only if we lose.

2001
02:04:58,625 --> 02:05:00,750
If we win,
they will take care of him.

2002
02:05:00,833 --> 02:05:02,208
No problem, brother.

2003
02:05:02,583 --> 02:05:03,708
We will keep it low-key.

2004
02:05:03,791 --> 02:05:05,041
No, make it loud.

2005
02:05:05,791 --> 02:05:07,500
I want every villager to witness it.

2006
02:05:07,583 --> 02:05:10,375
No one should consider
crossing us ever again.

2007
02:05:10,833 --> 02:05:12,166
What do you want me to do?

2008
02:05:12,291 --> 02:05:13,625
They are barbaric people!

2009
02:05:13,708 --> 02:05:14,791
If I try to interfere,

2010
02:05:14,875 --> 02:05:17,708
they'll say it's an internal issue.

2011
02:05:21,625 --> 02:05:24,208
I'm just waiting for someone
to die, to step in.

2012
02:05:35,291 --> 02:05:38,833
<i>The vote count of the local body elections</i>
<i>is underway across Tamil Nadu.</i>

2013
02:05:38,916 --> 02:05:42,500

<i>Are you doing well?</i>

2017
02:06:07,708 --> 02:06:09,041
I'm doing just fine.

2019
02:06:11,875 --> 02:06:14,083
<i>Why is the salon burned down?</i>

2020
02:06:14,333 --> 02:06:15,916
Oh, that's nothing!

2021
02:06:16,333 --> 02:06:18,375
All our problems are over.

2022
02:06:18,916 --> 02:06:20,833
Look, I cast my vote.

2023
02:06:21,416 --> 02:06:24,291
The villagers have started talking to me,
just like before.

2024
02:06:24,375 --> 02:06:25,916
They also come to get haircuts!

2025
02:06:26,041 --> 02:06:29,416
The only issue is that Esaki steals
the powder bottle occasionally!

2026
02:06:34,791 --> 02:06:37,083
Side Burn, please forgive me.

2027
02:06:37,166 --> 02:06:39,666
Why do you have a long face?

2028
02:06:39,833 --> 02:06:42,000
It's your smile that
makes you the person you are.

2029
02:06:42,083 --> 02:06:44,208
<i>I'll be back in two days.</i>

2030
02:06:45,083 --> 02:06:46,000
Don't crowd here.

2031
02:06:46,083 --> 02:06:48,625
Only one person can accompany
the candidate.

2032
02:06:48,708 --> 02:06:51,958
The vote counting has begun.
First up, Kallikulam.

2033
02:06:53,375 --> 02:06:54,916
I haven't eaten for days.

2034
02:06:55,541 --> 02:06:56,708
I have no work either.

2035
02:06:56,916 --> 02:06:57,791
Wellâ€¦

2036
02:06:57,875 --> 02:06:59,958
one word from you
gets new roads built.

2037
02:07:00,041 --> 02:07:02,708
You can get street lamps installed
and proper water supply for all.

2038
02:07:02,791 --> 02:07:04,750
Why can't you get
a meal for yourself?

2039
02:07:07,083 --> 02:07:08,666
I got all that for my vote.

2040
02:07:09,916 --> 02:07:11,583
I didn't earn it.

2041
02:07:16,458 --> 02:07:17,583
Eat this.

2042
02:07:24,583 --> 02:07:25,500
What is it?

2043
02:07:25,583 --> 02:07:27,708
You want to earn your meal.
Is that all?

2044

Next up, Soorangudi.
Take a good look.

2049
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,791
I've asked the postal truck
to come here.

2050
02:08:29,875 --> 02:08:31,833
Just sneak into it.

2051
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,708
If they stop us at the village border,
I will handle it.

2052
02:08:34,875 --> 02:08:37,041
You can't be here
when the result is announced.

2053
02:08:39,041 --> 02:08:40,333
It was my father's dream

2054
02:08:40,416 --> 02:08:42,583
that I earn my own money
and open a salon in this village.

2055
02:08:42,666 --> 02:08:44,166
So, I'm not leaving.

2056
02:08:44,333 --> 02:08:45,916

2057
02:09:15,916 --> 02:09:18,208
-Aren't you a Southerner?
-Yes.

2058
02:09:18,291 --> 02:09:20,083
Shut down your shop and go home.

2059
02:09:21,625 --> 02:09:23,166
You shouldn't be here.

2060
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:25,666
Please leave,
at least for Side Burn's sake.

2061
02:09:26,208 --> 02:09:27,333
Go.

2062
02:09:33,791 --> 02:09:35,708
If you can, make him get an education.

2063
02:09:36,625 --> 02:09:38,250

2064
02:09:59,083 --> 02:10:00,708

02:12:24,041 --> 02:12:27,458
Sir, I told you.
He won't listen to anyone.

2090
02:12:27,541 --> 02:12:28,666
Let's go.

2091
02:12:28,750 --> 02:12:30,458
Who is here to help you?

2092
02:12:30,875 --> 02:12:31,708
What?

2093
02:12:31,791 --> 02:12:33,041
I want a shave.

2094
02:12:33,166 --> 02:12:34,333
A shave?

2095
02:12:34,625 --> 02:12:35,666
Right now?

2096
02:12:39,416 --> 02:12:40,250
Okay.

2097
02:12:40,333 --> 02:12:42,083
-An old man?
-In a wheelchair.

2098
02:12:42,333 --> 02:12:43,750
-That's my father.
-Your father?

2099
02:12:44,333 --> 02:12:45,375
Let's do it another day?

2100
02:12:45,458 --> 02:12:50,291
<i>Rathinam is maintaining his 12 vote lead</i>
<i>in Soorangudi's local body elections.</i>

2101
02:12:50,375 --> 02:12:52,833
<i>We will conclude</i>
<i>the vote count shortly.</i>

2102
02:12:56,250 --> 02:12:58,541
It doesn't matter
even if my father gets hurt.

2103
02:12:58,916 --> 02:12:59,875
Kill him.

2104
02:12:59,958 --> 02:13:01,041
Alright.

2105
02:13:04,416 --> 02:13:05,583
Kill him.

2106
02:13:12,083 --> 02:13:13,250
Mandela!

2107
02:13:24,208 --> 02:13:26,458
My son needs a haircut.

2108
02:13:26,541 --> 02:13:28,875
I just came here
to see if you were around.

2109
02:13:33,625 --> 02:13:35,500
I can only do it after I shave him.

2110
02:13:35,583 --> 02:13:37,500
That's okay.
I'll wait right here.

2111
02:13:38,875 --> 02:13:42,166
Someone else just turned up
with an iron rod.

2112
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
I don't care
how many people turn up.

2113
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:47,250
Just do away with him!

2114
02:13:50,958 --> 02:13:52,083
Mandela!

2115
02:13:53,625 --> 02:13:55,541
Can you dye my mustache?

2116
02:14:03,833 --> 02:14:05,000
Mandela!

2117
02:14:05,875 --> 02:14:08,750
My grandma wants a haircut.

2118
02:14:10,458 --> 02:14:13,083
Mandela, I need a haircut.

2119
02:14:13,291 --> 02:14:15,666
Do as I say.
Just kill them all!

2120
02:14:15,750 --> 02:14:17,041
The entire village is here!

2121
02:14:17,125 --> 02:14:18,208
The entire village?

2122
02:14:18,291 --> 02:14:19,833
I can't do this.
I am leaving.

2123
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:22,333
Get back here!

2124
02:14:22,791 --> 02:14:23,916
What happened?

2125
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:24,833
Come on.

2126
02:14:24,916 --> 02:14:25,833
What is it?

2127
02:14:25,916 --> 02:14:28,333
Are you here for a haircut or a shave?

2128
02:14:41,708 --> 02:14:43,375
Where are they going?

2129
02:14:44,416 --> 02:14:45,541
Pull over.

2130
02:14:45,625 --> 02:14:47,083
Guys, stop!

2131
02:14:47,166 --> 02:14:52,291
<i>Mathialagan is the lead</i>

2132
02:14:53,458 --> 02:14:54,666
Hey!

2133
02:15:01,958 --> 02:15:03,250
Damn it!

2134
02:15:49,250 --> 02:15:50,958
Just repaying an old debt.

2135
02:15:52,041 --> 02:15:53,375
Want a log?

2136
02:15:53,791 --> 02:15:55,916
No, thanks.
I have my jug.

2137
02:16:07,875 --> 02:16:10,208
Go ahead and shave.

2138
02:16:10,875 --> 02:16:11,916
Okay.

2139
02:16:14,500 --> 02:16:17,083
