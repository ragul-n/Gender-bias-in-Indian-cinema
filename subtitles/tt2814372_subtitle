1
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:50,267
Gippi!!!

2
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,033
Yeah!!!

3
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,800
Oh Gippi!!!

4
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,202
Yes, Mummy! What is it?

5
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,867
Listen!!!

6
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:02,067
Ugh!

7
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:05,168
What?
- Anchal's on the phone!

8
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:06,333
Oh...

9
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:08,000
You never listen to me! Here!

10
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,867
Hello Anchal? Hold on for a second.

11
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:13,101
Mummy! Hang up the phone!

12
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:17,802
Booboo! Stop listening
to my calls! Hang up!

13
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:19,500
Ok now, what's up?

14
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,435
Gippi, l think they're
getting bigger!

15
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:25,135
Oh no! Yours were already so big!

16
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,903
l know, but they're poking out
of my school uniform. What do l do?

17
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:33,069
Howwould l knoM
Mine are still like little samosas.

18
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:35,234
Can't you think of something?
Please!

19
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:39,102
Make two braids and leave them
hanging in front. They'll get hidden.

20
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:40,766
Oh, good idea!

21
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:44,937
Ok, have to go get ready now.
See you at school. Bye!

22
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:14,301
Good morning boys and girls!

23
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:16,367
Good morning, Sister!

24
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:20,903
Welcome back to school.
l hope you had a splendid summer...

25
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:26,671
Because now, it's time for classes,
tests and homework!

26
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:27,366
Ouch!

27
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:38,601
l hate the first day of school.

28
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,635
l know,
it sucks towake up so early.

29
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,102
Not just that, l hate how
eveyone is always so excited.

30
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:47,133
Like they were dying to be back.

31
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:55,204
And they act like they
missed each other soooo much!

32
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:58,001
Hey Tina!!! How are you?!!

33
00:06:58,065 --> 00:07:02,002
And they suck up to the teachers as if
their cheesy smiles can wipe out...

34
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:03,833
...evemhing that
happened last year.

35
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:08,536
Good morning, Mrs. Batra!
- Good morning.

36
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,300
Ugh! These girls.

37
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,202
9th grade, huh? Ready?

38
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,133
l guess...

39
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:31,005
Oh my God, Mini! Did you check out
the Histoy book? Nehru was so cute!

40
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:33,967
Hot.
- And the Biology book?!

41
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:36,200
What's so great about new textbooks?

42
00:07:36,265 --> 00:07:42,004
Yeah... but that chapter on the
reproductive system is pretty awesome.

43
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:46,536
lt'll be so weird when they teach
it in class! Can you imagine...

44
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,168
Hi Gurpreet! Hi Anchal.
- Hi...

45
00:07:49,232 --> 00:07:52,234
Howwas your summer?
Isn't it great to be back?

46
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:53,700
No.

47
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:58,637
Oh. Yeah, l know. 9th grade
is going to be tough, right?

48
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:00,167
No.

49
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:04,469
Uh... what else is up?
How are your Mummy and Dad?

50
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:08,035
Listen, Ashish...
- OH. MY. GOD. Who is that?!

51
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:12,936
Hi guys, meet my newfriend, Kabir.

52
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,600
Who cares?

53
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,901
Hi guys! Isn't he so cute?

54
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:22,637
His name is Kabir and his
familyjust moved next to Shamira.

55
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:23,900
lsn't she so lucky?

56
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:26,068
Extremely.
- l know, right?!

57
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:32,069
Titli's right.
Some people have all the luck.

58
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:35,635
Please! What's so lucky
about being anorexic?

59
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:38,835
You're right, Gurpreet.
Women should look like you.

60
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:41,001
Full-full, you knoM

61
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:44,601
Go back to your seat, Ashish.

62
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:52,802
l shall not tolerate sloppiness,
tardiness...

63
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,569
lt is nowtime for us
to read the New Testament.

64
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:58,201
Trigonomety and Calculus are highly
advanced forms of Mathematics!

65
00:08:58,466 --> 00:09:00,434
lmpoliteness... Inattentiveness...

66
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,934
We shall learn about
reproduction in this class.

67
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,969
And any kind of disorderliness.

68
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:09,701
This year, you guys get
to do your own experiments.

69
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:13,603
One word in English,
and you're out of the class!

70
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,035
ls that clear?

71
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:26,902
Are you Ok?
- l'm good, thanks.

72
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:33,470
You sure?
- Yeah, see? All good. Thanks.

73
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:38,570
Well, as l said,
Chemisty is a dangerous subject!

74
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:50,102
A_! Does your ass hurt, Gurpreet?

75
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,468
No, but thanks for your concern.

76
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:58,600
What are you doing?

77
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:03,937
Just looking for cracks where
you fell. Oh look, there's one!

78
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:08,501
Don't look too closely,
you might fall into it.

79
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:11,900
Whatever.

80
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:17,668
Why don't you go home
and put some balm on your ass?

81
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:19,734
You'll definitely need
more than one bottle!

82
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,734
Hi didi!
- Hi.

83
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:50,003
Eww, Booboo. You stink!

84
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:52,034
Please! l smell amazing!
You're the stinky one.

85
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:54,901
No, you're the stinky one.
- Whatever, you shower with shit.

86
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:56,500
You shower with snot.

87
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:58,701
You shower with pee.
- You shower with vomit.

88
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:00,467
So go take a shower.

89
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,333
Look who's come!

90
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,100
Hi Mummy.

91
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:11,867
Howwas school?
- Fine.

92
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:16,437
Mummy! lth grade is so hard!
And our teacher stinks!

93
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:18,800
And she didn't let
me sit next to Rocky.

94
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:20,701
Now l have to sit
next to some stupid girl.

95
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:22,667
Great, she can be your girlfriend!

96
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,701
Booboo is not interested in girls.

97
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:26,734
Yeah, he's too young, poor thing.

98
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,701
That's not what l meant.

99
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:36,768
ls that your daughter, Pappi?

100
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,901
Yes!
- She's all grown up!

101
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,468
Yeah, she's even taller
than her mother now.

102
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:44,000
Say hello, Gippi.
- Hello.

103
00:11:44,065 --> 00:11:48,969
She's even got hair on her arms now!
Why don't you get them waxed?

104
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:51,934
Actuall_, l keep telling
her but she doesn't listen.

105
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,069
At least get your eyebrows
done today, Gippi.

106
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:57,801
l don't want to do anything.
l'm going home.

107
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,802
ls this a new shade, Mummy?

108
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:06,301
Yes, dear.

109
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,901
Some people are so tacky!

110
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:35,336
l know! Orange shoes!
- With red shoes! Disaster!

111
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,601
Oh, hi didi.
- Hello again.

112
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,000
You won't believe

113
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:41,333
Orange shoes and red polish.
l heard.

114
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,801
Do you always have
to be this grumpy?

115
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:49,834
Hello? Oh, hi Papa!

116
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,000
Papa!

117
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:54,501
l'm good, what's up?
Booboo, let me talk!

118
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,501
Papa, Booboo has become a balloon!

119
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:59,402
Didi's become a buffalo!
- Shut up.

120
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:01,668
How are you, Papa?

121
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:08,368
Oh... so soon?

122
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:13,636
What happened?
- No, no, l'm vey excited.

123
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:18,603
Yeah, l'll tell eveyone.
Love you, bye.

124
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:27,336
What's all the mystey about?
What did Papa say?

125
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:32,269
He's getting engaged next weekend.

126
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:35,335
We're all invited to the party.

127
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:40,537
Party? Awesome! But l have
nothing to wear! Let me go check.

128
00:13:42,366 --> 00:13:43,667
Mummy...

129
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:46,635
You should definitely go.

130
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:51,203
l can't close the parlour
on weekends or l would've come too.

131
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:54,535
Are you Ok? Papa suddenly...

132
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:59,437
Of course l'm Ok!
l haven't seen him in 2 years.

133
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:02,735
Mar_, have kids, grandkids.
What do l care?

134
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,667
Should l make rajma
for dinner today?

135
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:08,770
Yeah! l'm starving! Need any help?
- No, go finish your homework.

136
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:24,667
Mummy?

137
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:28,833
Why aren't you in bed?

138
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:34,504
l didn't have icecream after
dinner tonight, so l couldn't sleep.

139
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,666
lsn't it a bit late for icecream?

140
00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:42,404
Not at all.
You want some?Just a little bit?

141
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:45,134
Please?

142
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:51,133
lsn't it yummy?

143
00:14:58,766 --> 00:15:05,839
You know... l'm really not interested
in Papa's stupid party. l'm not going.

144
00:15:06,165 --> 00:15:09,535
No, Gippi. You must go.

145
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:11,567
But why?

146
00:15:11,632 --> 00:15:16,203
l want eveyone there
to look at you two and say,

147
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:19,234
''Look howwell Pappi
is bringing them up.''

148
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:21,267
''They have evemhing they need.''

149
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:23,634
l'll feel proud.

150
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:32,237
You're right, Mummy.
We're not missing out on anything.

151
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:37,602
Actually, we're lucky that we
just have to deal with one parent.

152
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,667
lf l had two,
l would've run away by now.

153
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,202
Run away then. Who's stopping you?

154
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:44,367
Let me finish my icecream first.
- No, go right now.

155
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:46,100
No, no please.

156
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:49,402
Ok run away tomorrowthen.
Finish your icecream.

157
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:59,203
Jennifer isn't so bad.
l think Papa will be happy with her.

158
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:02,201
So what's the problem?
- Mummy!

159
00:16:02,432 --> 00:16:08,171
l don't think she's still in love
with Papa, but she must feel jealous.

160
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:09,633
Hmm.

161
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:15,033
He's really cute, isn't he?

162
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:19,670
Ew, he looks like a boy band singer!
- Yeah, and he's a bit snobbish too.

163
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:21,668
No wonder he gets
along with Shamira.

164
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,501
They're both the same.

165
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,267
Guys!!!

166
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:26,566
Can you believe
we're going to have...

167
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:28,700
...Head Girl and Head Boy
elections this year?!

168
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:30,134
How exciting.

169
00:16:30,165 --> 00:16:33,501
Should we stand in the elections?
Might be fun!

170
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:36,201
Don't we need to get votes
from the whole school for that?

171
00:16:36,265 --> 00:16:39,301
Yeah, who's going to vote for us?

172
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,534
lsn't that perFect
for my Head Girl posters?

173
00:16:44,065 --> 00:16:46,700
Shamira's going to win, dude.
She's been planning it for years.

174
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:50,302
Oh! She's throwing
a welcome party for Kabir.

175
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:52,735
l'm sure they'll
start dating after that.

176
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:56,733
PerFect couple, right?

177
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,402
You know, Titli, you should
really stop gossiping so much.

178
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,434
Am l right? Right?

179
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:42,301
Oops, sory!

180
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,168
Are you Ok, Gippi?

181
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:52,699
l'm fine, Ashish.

182
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:54,700
You're so strong, Gippi.

183
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:03,434
HoWs your head, Gurpreet?

184
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:06,034
First class.

185
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:11,103
And you, Anchal? You were sitting out
because you had your period, right?

186
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:15,602
All the boys know! Anyway, bye!

187
00:18:17,232 --> 00:18:19,400
You have your period again?!

188
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,600
Didn't l tell you
they come evey month?

189
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:27,901
Doesn't it feel weird?

190
00:18:28,366 --> 00:18:31,268
No, it's not that bad.

191
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:35,069
Put a pad in the morning,
and you don't even remember.

192
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:37,867
Shamira is not going
to let you forget.

193
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:41,436
l know. l hate her.

194
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:45,935
All the boys are going
to laugh at me now.

195
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:48,968
So what?
They were laughing at me too.

196
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:52,967
l made an ass of myself again!

197
00:18:54,232 --> 00:18:56,467
Eveyone falls in P.T. class.

198
00:18:57,499 --> 00:18:59,334
And what about that
day in Chemisty class?

199
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:03,469
But then Sir came to save you!
l was sojealous.

200
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:08,136
l think he's hot.
Just like Ranbir Kapoor!

201
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:12,570
Guys this is the fun part.
Mixing things, burning things...

202
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,569
Or perhaps, even blowing up things!

203
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:19,469
You guys are going to get partners
to work with for the rest of the term.

204
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:21,033
Ok, hold on, hold on.

205
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:24,936
Here in this jar are the names
of the pretty girls in the class

206
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:27,200
And the boys need to
come ahead and pick up a chit

207
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:28,466
And let's see...

208
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,969
...what kind of new chemisty
you form with your new partner!

209
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:37,066
Anchal.

210
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:40,067
Shamira!

211
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:43,400
Ruati.

212
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:50,000
Gurpreet.

213
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:06,401
Uhh... May l?

214
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:19,368
Do you... do you like Chemisty?

215
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:20,833
No.

216
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,334
Oh.

217
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:31,267
So, what do you like?

218
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:32,933
Why?

219
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,000
Just curious...

220
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:40,935
Let me do the rest of the experiment!
- Chill, l'll do it.

221
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:44,368
Why? Do you think
l'm too stupid to do it?

222
00:20:44,432 --> 00:20:45,866
No, no.

223
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:55,237
Guys don't forget to put
the acetic acid right at the end.

224
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:58,101
l won't recommend that.
- Why?

225
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,401
lt's Ok.
This chemical isn't harmful...

226
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:12,469
Shut up! You knewthis
was going to happen, didn't you?

227
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:14,835
You're such ajerk, Kabir!

228
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:29,934
Didi...

229
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,435
Leave me alone!

230
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:35,835
But Mummy's calling you downstairs.

231
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,234
Hi didi!

232
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:47,967
Didi...

233
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:12,702
Don't eat too much,
there are no toilets on the way!

234
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:15,301
Booboo, did you poop in the morning?

235
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:18,001
Mummy! People can hear you!
- Shush! Did you poop, dear?

236
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,767
Yes, Mummy. l did!
- Good boy.

237
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:25,771
Listen... Behave yourself there, Ok?
- Yes, Mummy.

238
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:29,736
Bye. Don't fight!
Take care of yourselves!

239
00:23:39,699 --> 00:23:43,369
Are those Mr. Grewal's kids?
They're so grown up!

240
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:47,736
A_ so cute!!!

241
00:23:47,966 --> 00:23:53,037
You're Gippi, right? Good Lord!
You look just like your mother!

242
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,700
Same to same!

243
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,168
Yeah but look fatter than last time.

244
00:23:57,232 --> 00:23:58,833
Why don't you join a gym?

245
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:03,704
Hello my little darlings!
How are you?

246
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:07,903
Let's go,
your Dad's waiting for you.

247
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,301
Do you like my saree?

248
00:24:10,566 --> 00:24:12,668
lsn't it gorgeous?
- Yeah, it's nice.

249
00:24:12,733 --> 00:24:16,036
Ooh it's lovely!
Makes you look like a princess!

250
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:18,801
And you know,
l've been taking Hindi lessons too.

251
00:24:18,866 --> 00:24:21,201
''l'm getting engaged
tonight'', right?

252
00:24:21,265 --> 00:24:23,600
Yeah!
- Papa!

253
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:30,539
Hey Gippo! My darling!
Hey Booboo, my little dumpling!

254
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:33,935
Did you forget your old Papa?

255
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,901
Of course not!
- We missed you so much!

256
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:38,101
Really? Then let me...

257
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:45,303
Sir, can we take a family photo?
- Why not? Sure! Come come come!

258
00:24:45,566 --> 00:24:47,534
One second.
- What's wrong, Gippi?

259
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:51,536
l should call Mummy.
Tell her that we've reached.

260
00:24:53,165 --> 00:24:56,201
Sor_, Papa. l should get ready too.

261
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,867
Just take our picture then.

262
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,567
Smile please!

263
00:25:13,866 --> 00:25:17,836
Hey Gippi!
Come here for a minute please.

264
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,067
Yes?

265
00:25:19,132 --> 00:25:23,002
This is Mrs. Khanna.
Her son goes to your school.

266
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:26,535
Oh really? That's nice.
St. May's High School, Simla?

267
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:30,036
Oh no, l'm not in high school yet.
That's a completely separate wing.

268
00:25:30,065 --> 00:25:31,699
So what? Go talk to him.

269
00:25:31,766 --> 00:25:35,903
Please, dear.
He's all alone on the terrace.

270
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:38,201
He could use some company.

271
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:42,636
Poor thing. You know, he hates
these kind of social gatherings.

272
00:25:42,699 --> 00:25:46,102
Hey, why are you not going up?
- Yeah.

273
00:26:01,132 --> 00:26:03,634
Umm... l...

274
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:08,635
Yes?
- Uhh... Mummy...

275
00:26:10,432 --> 00:26:15,036
Mummy?
- Yeah... Your Mummy sent me...

276
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:21,905
Ah! She must think l'm bored.
And she's right.

277
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:25,900
Who are you?

278
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,703
l'm Gurpreet.
But eveyone calls me Gippi.

279
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:32,502
Gippi! How cute.

280
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:34,668
l'm Arjun.

281
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:40,800
Cigarette?

282
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:45,437
Good. l don't like girls who smoke.

283
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:02,535
You know, we go to the same school.

284
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,502
Really? St. May's?

285
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:13,034
But you don't look like
you're in high school yet.

286
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,836
How old are you?
- Fourteen.

287
00:27:21,632 --> 00:27:25,736
But, you know,
l'm really mature for my age.

288
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,867
Really?

289
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:35,538
So, what brings you here?
- l told you... Your mom sent me...

290
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,736
No, l mean, here.
In Delhi. At this party.

291
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:43,903
Oh. It's my Papa's engagement.

292
00:27:44,566 --> 00:27:46,534
Second marriage or third?

293
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,400
Second.

294
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:52,901
And your mom?

295
00:27:53,032 --> 00:27:55,467
She's still single.

296
00:27:55,532 --> 00:27:57,800
Lucky you.

297
00:27:59,566 --> 00:28:04,437
Mine's with her fourth husband.

298
00:28:06,733 --> 00:28:08,568
And your dad?

299
00:28:15,265 --> 00:28:16,899
New York.

300
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:23,702
Married to some blonde.
- We have so much in common!

301
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:28,434
l guess we do.

302
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:39,668
You wanna dance?

303
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:57,667
Do you like this song?
- What?

304
00:28:57,733 --> 00:28:59,868
This song? Do you like it?

305
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,400
lt's not bad.

306
00:29:01,466 --> 00:29:03,601
What?
- It's...

307
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:14,867
Are you Ok?

308
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:20,600
You wanna get outta here?

309
00:29:30,966 --> 00:29:36,571
Do you have a girlfriend?

310
00:29:40,432 --> 00:29:42,233
Nope.

311
00:29:42,966 --> 00:29:46,235
You got a bo_riend?
- Oh no, not at all.

312
00:29:48,499 --> 00:29:53,337
l find boys my age really immature.

313
00:29:54,933 --> 00:30:00,838
Boys these days, just want to talk
about videogames and cricket all day.

314
00:30:01,265 --> 00:30:04,935
What do they know about life?

315
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:07,934
Yeah. Totally.

316
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:10,234
Wanna hear a secret?

317
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:19,804
Sometimes, l wish l could disappear.
Go somewhere far far away...

318
00:30:22,232 --> 00:30:27,670
Kung Fu Panda! Shrek 2!!
Where are you?

319
00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:31,703
Where have you been?!
It's time for the ring ceremony!

320
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:41,704
There they are, my sweethearts!

321
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:45,335
Here goes!

322
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:50,468
Love you.
- Love you too.

00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:23,636
Hi! l got so bored here

324
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:24,699
Great...

325
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:28,836
lt was awesome! What music! What
food! Chicken tikka! Chicken kebab!

326
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:52,536
ls evemhing Ok, Gippi?
- l'm fine, Mummy. Just let me sleep.

327
00:33:30,632 --> 00:33:32,133
Hi...

328
00:33:34,032 --> 00:33:35,466
Hi!

329
00:33:35,699 --> 00:33:37,567
Oh, Hi.

330
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,536
Listen, if you want to
change partners, l understand...

331
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:45,768
Oh, you want to partner with
your girlfriend? Sure, whatever.

332
00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:49,001
l don't have a girlfriend!
l meant because of...

333
00:33:49,065 --> 00:33:51,100
Look, l really don't care, OK?

334
00:33:51,165 --> 00:33:53,467
Good afternoon,
my lovely ladies and gentlemen!

335
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:55,367
Good afternoon, Sir.

336
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:08,334
Hi Arjun!

337
00:34:08,499 --> 00:34:12,369
Hey, Gips! What are you doing here?

338
00:34:12,432 --> 00:34:15,301
No, l just... wanted to say Hi.

339

Hi.

340
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:20,167

Hey.

342
00:34:22,366 --> 00:34:25,102
Uhh... So...

343
00:34:25,165 --> 00:34:28,935
We're going to Sunset Point later.
You wanna tag along?

344
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,003
Yeah!
- Yeah? Meet me here in half an hour.

345
00:34:33,132 --> 00:34:34,967
l'll go get the car.

346
00:34:35,132 --> 00:34:37,133
Bye.
- Bye!

347
00:34:37,432 --> 00:34:40,201
Sweet girl!
- Totally!

348
00:35:30,332 --> 00:35:34,035
Silence, silence! Good.

349
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:39,303
We are going to have our school
elections this year, as usual.

350
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:45,238
Whoever wants to enter the elections,
can submit their names in my office.

351
00:35:45,299 --> 00:35:49,369
The elections will be
held on the _5th of December...

352
00:35:49,432 --> 00:35:53,435
... and the results will be
announced at the Christmas Party.

353
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:55,300
Nowyou may go.

354
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:59,135
My campaign posters are ready!
- No way!

355
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,568
Yeah, and they're awesome!
Like, l can't even tell you!

356
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:04,068
l've been planning them for months!

357
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:11,435
lf she becomes Head Girl,
l'll kill myself.

358
00:36:11,499 --> 00:36:14,935
l know, lets ditch
the Christmas Party.

359
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,136
We'll never find dates, anyway.

360
00:36:20,366 --> 00:36:22,201
What is it?

361
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:24,233
l might have a date...

362
00:36:30,332 --> 00:36:32,267
Noway.

363
00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:35,200
No way!

364
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:38,467
No way!
- Just listen!

365
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:40,967
What are you two whispering about?

366
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,434
Are you asking Anchal out?

367
00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:46,535
Why don't you guys
admit that you're lovers?

368
00:36:47,132 --> 00:36:51,269
Actually, l was telling
her about my bo_riend.

369
00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:55,869
Bo_riend?
- Uh huh. Bo_riend.

370
00:36:55,933 --> 00:37:00,437
Where did you find a bo_riend?
- Jealous, Shamira?

371
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:05,370
Of what, your imaginay bo_riend?
l'm dying ofjealousy!

372
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:08,769
You will when you see him.
He's in high school.

373
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:12,036
And he's vey, vey, vey hot.

374
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:16,169
Why don't you bring him to my party,
if he's so hot?

375
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:20,368
What's wrong? Can't you
get your bo_riend to a party?

376
00:37:20,432 --> 00:37:23,168
No, he'll come.
Of course, he'll come.

377
00:37:23,232 --> 00:37:25,200
Great.
- Great.

378
00:38:09,966 --> 00:38:11,967
Hi Arjun! Hi Veer! Hi Jai!

379
00:38:12,032 --> 00:38:13,133

00:38:23,966 --> 00:38:26,668
So...There's this party on Friday.

00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:28,768
You wanna go?
- Party?

384
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:31,101
Yeah,

385
00:38:31,165 --> 00:38:35,402
l mean, l hate her
but she throws the cooles't parties.

386
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:39,868
Why not? Don't have
anything else going on.

387
00:38:39,933 --> 00:38:42,168
Great!

388
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:46,134
So, l'll pick you up.

How are you, Mummy?

393
00:39:01,866 --> 00:39:04,068
What do you want?

394
00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:10,034
This one's tight too, Mummy...

395
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:12,668
Didn't l ask for a big size?
- This IS big, Madam.

00:39:12,766 --> 00:39:16,970
So give me a bigger one!
Look properly!

397
00:39:17,165 --> 00:39:19,834
Yeah, this looks fine.

00:39:20,165 --> 00:39:23,201

399
00:39:40,065 --> 00:39:44,636

00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,201

- Vey good, Madam. Vey good!

401
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:53,303
Yeah, it's nice.
Nowwe just need one more thing.

403
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,901
Ty 36, Madam.
- Ok let's ty that.

404
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,267
Can't you knock?

405
00:41:04,933 --> 00:41:09,003
Aww, you look so nice, didi. Smile!

406
00:41:10,032 --> 00:41:15,537
Wow, look at my little princess!
So beautiful!

407
00:41:15,566 --> 00:41:17,067
Thank you.

408
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:23,938
Nowyou're all grown up.
Bras, bo_riends, parties.

409
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,736
Once you get your period,
you'll be a full woman!

410
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:29,801
Shh! Booboo's going to hear us.
- He doesn't know anything!

411
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:37,906
Listen, just be careful.
These boys can't be trusted.

412
00:41:37,966 --> 00:41:39,834
Mom, please.

413
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:41,734
When is your bo_riend
getting here, didi?

414
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,600
Mummy, he's so awesome
you'll love him!

415
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:49,238
Really? My my, are you blushing?

416
00:41:49,899 --> 00:41:51,567
He's here!

417
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:56,535
Hi.
- Hey.

418
00:41:58,499 --> 00:42:00,901
Hi.
- Hello.

419
00:42:02,766 --> 00:42:04,534
Arjun?

420
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:06,233
Yes.

421
00:42:06,499 --> 00:42:09,168
Aren't you a little old?
- Mummy!

422
00:42:09,232 --> 00:42:10,499
No no, it's Ok!

423
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:14,636
Her father was also much
older than me. No problem at all!

424
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,801
Let's go, Arjun.

425
00:42:18,165 --> 00:42:21,468
Bye.
- Nice meeting you!

426
00:42:31,065 --> 00:42:32,166
Oh...

427
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:35,934
Are they coming with us?

428
00:42:37,466 --> 00:42:40,936
Yeah. Is that a problem?

429
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,735
No, no. Not at all.

430
00:42:43,733 --> 00:42:45,468
Cool, let's go.

431
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:57,201
He's so hot!
- l know, right?

432
00:42:57,466 --> 00:43:02,137
Gurpreet! l knew it.
Anchal's your date, isn't she?

433
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:05,034
Actually l'm here with Arjun.

434
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:06,934
Arjun!

435
00:43:08,899 --> 00:43:10,166
Yes?

436
00:43:10,432 --> 00:43:12,834
Meet Shamira. This is her party.

437
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:14,867
Hey.
- Sup?

438
00:43:15,065 --> 00:43:17,634
Let's go get a coke, Arjun.

439
00:43:25,032 --> 00:43:28,468
The guy had them
lined up on his shelf.

440
00:43:34,933 --> 00:43:36,100
Let's go!
- Cheers!

441
00:43:36,165 --> 00:43:37,966
Cheers.

442
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,635
She looks like she escaped a zoo!

443
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:34,035
l think she's great.
l wish l was like her.

444
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:35,633
What?

445
00:45:50,799 --> 00:45:53,401
This is my house,
not some sleazy club!

446
00:45:53,466 --> 00:45:56,001
Start the music!
- Yeah!!!

447
00:45:56,499 --> 00:45:59,235
No! And who the hell are you?

448
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:02,900
He's with me.

449
00:46:03,933 --> 00:46:05,701
How many bo_riends do you have?

450
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:08,401
Jealous, Shamira?

451
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:10,801
He probably couldn't
find someone his own age...

452
00:46:10,866 --> 00:46:13,568
...so he thought he'll get
it from a fat little schoolgirl!

453
00:46:13,632 --> 00:46:17,635
Shamira!
- What? Do you want to add to this?

454
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:19,634
No, l just...

455
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:23,803
l don't care what any of you think!

456
00:46:23,866 --> 00:46:28,870
Arjun doesn't think l'm fat or ugly.
He likes me just the way l am!

457
00:46:28,933 --> 00:46:30,567
Right, Arjun?

458
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:42,337
Arjun? You like me, don't you?

459
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:46,569
Look, there's been
a misunderstanding.

460
00:46:46,632 --> 00:46:48,800
You're a nice girl but, you and l...

461
00:46:48,866 --> 00:46:55,339
But you said l was cute!
And that you like to talking to me!

462
00:46:55,399 --> 00:46:57,701
And you came to this party with me!

463
00:46:57,766 --> 00:47:00,135
Can we talk about this later?
- No!

464
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:04,236
l want to talk right now! Why
did you come to this party with me?

465
00:47:05,432 --> 00:47:06,699
Tell me!

466
00:47:06,766 --> 00:47:09,902
We came for the free booze.
- And food!

467
00:47:10,165 --> 00:47:13,902
And to hook up with hot schoolgirls!
- High five, bro!

468
00:47:38,432 --> 00:47:40,700
l'm glad that's been clarified.

469
00:47:40,766 --> 00:47:45,504
l was wondering how a girl
like you found a bo_riend.

470
00:47:45,566 --> 00:47:52,205
You suck at studies and sports.
You have no talent.

471
00:47:52,265 --> 00:47:57,503
You're just a fat, ugly loser!
You're nothing.

472
00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:03,568
She's not nothing!
- Yeah, she's a great girl!

473
00:48:06,065 --> 00:48:07,666
Just shut up!

474
00:48:07,733 --> 00:48:11,369
What do you guys knoM
You're even bigger losers than l am.

475
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:15,368
And you! You think you're cool?

476
00:48:15,432 --> 00:48:17,801
Because you're skinny, hot and rich?

477
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:19,766
Eveyone hates you, Shamira.

478
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:23,500
Eveyone loves me, honey.

479
00:48:23,566 --> 00:48:27,569
You'll see when they all vote
for me in the Head Girl elections.

480
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:31,303
Oh please! Anyone could
beat you in that stupid election.

481
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:34,302
Oh really? Can you?

482
00:48:34,366 --> 00:48:35,734
Of course.

483
00:48:35,799 --> 00:48:39,335
Great. Elections are in 3 months.
See you then.

484
00:48:39,399 --> 00:48:42,168
Leave my house now. Out!

485
00:48:48,466 --> 00:48:49,733
Let her be.

486
00:51:27,466 --> 00:51:30,502
The human heart is
a vey delicate organ.

487
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,302
What do you want?
- What's wrong, didi? You can tell me.

488
00:51:46,632 --> 00:51:49,468
What can you do?
- l can help you!

489
00:51:49,532 --> 00:51:54,036
Get lost.
- Did Arjun dump you, didi?

490
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:56,267
l said, get lost!

491
00:51:56,332 --> 00:51:59,601
Don't wor_, there are lots of
other boys. You'll find another one.

492
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,468
Of course. You would know!

493
00:52:02,532 --> 00:52:05,935
You're looking for a bo_riend
yourself, aren't you?

494
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,971
Poor little Booboo wishes
he had boobies, doesn't he?

495
00:52:16,966 --> 00:52:18,500
No wonder he dumped you.

496
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:21,367
Who would want to
date someone like you?

497
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,636
l told you to knock...
- Shut up! What did you say to Booboo?

498
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:31,001
The truth.

499
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:34,001
You can't slap me like this!
l'm not a kid anymore!

500
00:52:34,065 --> 00:52:36,901
lf you don't learn to behave
yourself, l'll slap you eveyday!

501
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:40,602
Fine! Slap me, hit me!
l don't care! l hate my life!

502
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,935
l hate evemhing! l wanna die!

503
00:52:53,399 --> 00:52:56,201
ln front of eveybody, Mummy.

504
00:52:56,232 --> 00:53:01,003
Fat, ugl_, loser.
She said l was nothing.

505
00:53:01,065 --> 00:53:06,136
She puts others down to feel
better about herself, doesn't she?

506
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:09,101
Yeah, that's exactly what she does!

507
00:53:09,165 --> 00:53:12,568
And weren't you doing the
same thing with Booboo right noM

508
00:53:20,165 --> 00:53:22,400
Forget about being fat or ugly.

509
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:27,437
lf you're kind to eveyone,
they won't care what you look like.

510
00:53:37,065 --> 00:53:41,068
Booboo! Sory sory sory
sory sory sory sory...

511
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:45,870
...SOly SOly SOly
sory sory sory sory!

512
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:56,804
Arjun... Shamira... and worst
of all, even Anchal hates me now.

513
00:53:56,866 --> 00:54:01,437
No big deal!
Just give her a big hug tomorrow...

514
00:54:01,499 --> 00:54:05,002
...and don't let go till
she forgives you. Good idea, right?

515
00:54:06,366 --> 00:54:09,736
That's all fine,
but what about this election?

516
00:54:10,065 --> 00:54:12,233
l just said that in
the heat of the moment.

517
00:54:12,299 --> 00:54:13,900
They must've forgotten by now.

518
00:54:14,032 --> 00:54:16,134
Have you registered for the
election yet?

519
00:54:17,232 --> 00:54:19,267
Registration is open.

520
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:26,800
Anchal...

521
00:54:45,733 --> 00:54:48,302
So what does 'Horny' mean?

522
00:54:56,165 --> 00:54:58,767
Oh my God, are you serious?

523
00:54:59,366 --> 00:55:01,234
E_! Yuck!

524
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:06,235
So only men can he horny, right?
- No. no. Women also!

525
00:55:06,332 --> 00:55:07,399
No way!

526
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:09,968
l read it in Mummy's
Jackie Collins novel!

527
00:55:10,032 --> 00:55:11,733
Gross!

528
00:55:13,065 --> 00:55:19,371
Listen, l'm sory about what l said.
You're not a bigger loser than l am.

529
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,734
Yeah, we're both equal.

530
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:25,269
No, l'm the bigger loser.

531
00:55:25,766 --> 00:55:27,801
That's true...
- What?

532
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:31,336
l have a bo_riend now.
That makes me cooler.

533
00:55:31,399 --> 00:55:36,370
Oooh, Ashish!
- Stop it, he's sweet.

534
00:55:36,432 --> 00:55:39,234
Ooooh sweet?!
- Shut up!

535
00:55:39,299 --> 00:55:42,168
Anchal and Ashish
sitting on a tree...

536
00:55:42,232 --> 00:55:43,833
Kissi...
- l'm going to kill you!

537
00:55:43,899 --> 00:55:48,737
l see that you've dumped
Ashish for your true love, Anchal.

538
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,300
What do you want noM

539
00:55:50,366 --> 00:55:55,170
l just registered for the election.
Your turn. Unless you're scared...

540
00:55:55,232 --> 00:55:57,367
Oh please! l'll do it right away.

541
00:55:57,632 --> 00:55:59,667
Let's go, Anchal.
- Awesome.

542
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:24,867
One.

543
00:56:24,933 --> 00:56:26,100
Two.

544
00:56:26,165 --> 00:56:27,332
Three.

545
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:28,766
And four.

546
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:30,968
Great, l have four votes.

547
00:56:31,032 --> 00:56:32,299
That's not so bad.

548
00:56:32,366 --> 00:56:37,370
Just be positive, Gippi. That's
how l got Anchal! Right, Anchal?

549
00:56:37,632 --> 00:56:39,000
Yes.

550
00:56:39,766 --> 00:56:41,601
l think we need a plan.

551
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:44,802
Let's make a list of things
Shamira has that you don't.

552
00:56:44,866 --> 00:56:47,001
Then we'll give those
things to you. Simple.

553
00:56:47,065 --> 00:56:48,766
Wow! How are you so good at this?

554
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:50,234
Gossip girl!

555
00:56:50,332 --> 00:56:51,766
Oh...

556
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:55,169
Ok, name one thing
she has that you don't.

557
00:56:55,232 --> 00:56:57,767
A waist? l have a wastebin.

558
00:56:57,899 --> 00:57:00,868
Hot body. What else?

559
00:57:00,933 --> 00:57:03,068
She has like 300 friends.

560
00:57:03,132 --> 00:57:05,701
Ooh! Popularity.

561
00:57:05,766 --> 00:57:08,835
And she gets 900/o evey year.

562
00:57:08,899 --> 00:57:11,067
Good marks.

563
00:57:11,132 --> 00:57:14,602
And she has a bo_riend.
- Kabir's not her bo_riend!

564
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:18,536
lf eveyone thinks they're together
then it's the same thing.

565
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:21,034
Bo_riend. Ok next?

566
00:57:21,165 --> 00:57:23,767
What next? How am l supposed
to get these things?

567
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:26,001
We'll help you, Gippi.

568
00:57:26,065 --> 00:57:27,833
Yeah, let's start right away.

569
00:57:27,899 --> 00:57:30,201
Yeah, come on!

570
00:57:34,032 --> 00:57:36,567
Hot bod_, remember?

571
01:00:32,532 --> 01:00:33,532
He_, Gips.

572
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:39,736
Didi? Didi, wait...

573
01:00:59,866 --> 01:01:03,369
Mummy's here! Maybe she'll
have a plan! Let's go!

574
01:01:03,432 --> 01:01:05,934
Come on! Hury!

575
01:01:08,566 --> 01:01:10,634
What's this?

576
01:01:12,366 --> 01:01:15,469
Your father's wedding card.

577
01:01:15,532 --> 01:01:18,334
But he hasn't even called yet!

578
01:01:19,399 --> 01:01:23,569
He did.
l guess l forgot to tell you.

579
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:26,068
What do you mean you forgot?

580
01:01:26,332 --> 01:01:29,368
How does it matter?
You know now, don't you?

581
01:01:30,499 --> 01:01:32,033
What about the rest
of the ceremonies?

582
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:36,036
Like when they put henna and that
yellow stuff all over? When are those?

583
01:01:54,532 --> 01:01:59,703
Do you still love Papa, Mummy?

584
01:02:00,532 --> 01:02:04,969
No, sweetheart. It's not that.

585
01:02:06,933 --> 01:02:09,335
You can talk to me, Mummy.

586
01:02:09,399 --> 01:02:13,836
Really? Have you grown up so much?

587
01:02:17,032 --> 01:02:20,034
Do you knowwhy your father
and l got divorced?

588
01:02:20,299 --> 01:02:23,301
Because you fought all the time.

589
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:25,701
And do you knowwhy we fought?

590
01:02:25,766 --> 01:02:27,601
No.

591
01:02:28,032 --> 01:02:32,369
Because your father was
ashamed to have me as his wife.

592
01:02:33,466 --> 01:02:41,407
He wanted a beautiful,
smart, classy wife.

593
01:02:41,566 --> 01:02:46,570
Not a small-town,
unsophisticated woman like me.

594
01:02:46,966 --> 01:02:50,402
Really?
- He used to be after me eveyday.

595
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:57,439
'Dress properly! Learn howto talk!
Stop embarrassing me!'

596
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:01,836
One da_,
l got tired of this humiliation.

597
01:03:01,966 --> 01:03:07,671
l told him to divorce
me if he hated me so much.

598
01:03:07,733 --> 01:03:09,701
And he actually did it?

599
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:12,401
lt seemed like he had
been waiting for that day.

600
01:03:16,432 --> 01:03:19,701
l never thought Papa
could be like that.

601
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:26,636
lt's vey difficult to find a man...

602
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:34,806
...who knows all your flaws,
and still loves you.

603
01:03:41,699 --> 01:03:47,371
When he called that da_,
l got scared.

604
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:51,234
You'll have a new mother now.

605
01:03:51,299 --> 01:03:54,502
Beautiful,
young, must be stylish too...

606
01:03:54,532 --> 01:03:57,768
So that's what it is!

607
01:03:57,799 --> 01:04:01,335
Do you think that Jennifer
is better than you?

608
01:04:01,532 --> 01:04:05,369
She's nothing compared to you!
She's really dumb and boring!

609
01:04:05,432 --> 01:04:07,867
And l think she's
Iosing her hair too!

610
01:04:08,132 --> 01:04:10,467
She'll be bald in no time!

611
01:04:10,532 --> 01:04:12,734
We can't stand her!

612
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:15,835
So, l have nothing to fear then?

613
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:18,368
Not at all.

614
01:04:24,966 --> 01:04:28,235
As you all know, the new Head Boy
and Girl elections are vey near.

615
01:04:28,499 --> 01:04:32,302

620
01:04:45,866 --> 01:04:48,401
l hate talking about
myself like this...

621
01:04:48,466 --> 01:04:50,868
... but it's important to
knowyour candidates right?

622

...and who will bring
gloy to our school.

01:05:24,165 --> 01:05:26,133
Come, my child.

631
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:38,768
Hi eveyone...

632
01:05:41,065 --> 01:05:46,770
My name is Gurpreet Kaur.
Eveyone calls me Gippi.

633
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:49,201
You can call me Gippi too.

634
01:05:52,599 --> 01:06:01,441
l think l should become the
next Head Girl because l'm fun...

01:06:04,566 --> 01:06:07,035
And funny...

636
01:06:08,299 --> 01:06:12,636
And l suck at speeches so
l've prepared something for you.

637
01:06:12,699 --> 01:06:16,769
lf eveybody could
clear the stage please?

638
01:07:18,966 --> 01:07:20,167

Didi!

640
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:29,035
Gurpreet Kaur, ladies and gentlemen.

641
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:31,701
Oops, sory. ''Gippi''.

642
01:07:31,966 --> 01:07:35,369
She was right,
she really is vey funny.

643
01:07:35,432 --> 01:07:40,670
And the funniest thing is that she
thinks she can win this election.

644
01:07:40,933 --> 01:07:43,935
Wow, hilarious!

645
01:07:51,499 --> 01:07:54,702
Why do we even ty?

646
01:07:58,499 --> 01:08:03,370
l'm done. l was stupid
to think l could beat her.

647
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:08,001
What are you doing here?
- l...

648
01:08:08,065 --> 01:08:12,002
lf you're here to make fun of me,
then please go away.

649
01:08:12,065 --> 01:08:14,434
Why do you always
think that about me?

650
01:08:14,499 --> 01:08:17,468
You're always with
that Shamira, so...

651
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:20,400
l know.

652
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:27,436
But l don't want to be with
her anymore. l want to be with you.

653
01:08:27,499 --> 01:08:30,001
What are you talking about?

654
01:08:30,132 --> 01:08:33,602
l like you, Gippi.
l want you to win this election.

655
01:08:33,632 --> 01:08:36,101
But... why?

656
01:08:45,432 --> 01:08:49,235
Remember when you fell off your
chair on the first day of class?

657
01:08:49,299 --> 01:08:50,867
Yeah...

658
01:08:50,933 --> 01:08:53,468
Do you knowwhat
l told Shamira that day?

659
01:08:53,532 --> 01:08:55,500
That girl is such a loser?

660
01:08:55,566 --> 01:08:59,803
No! l told her that l used to do
that in my old school all the time.

661
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:02,569
Were you a loser in your old school?

662
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:05,468
No, l was just... a regular guy.

663
01:09:06,499 --> 01:09:09,435
l guess boys' schools are different.

664
01:09:09,499 --> 01:09:12,335
Here they make such a
big deal out of evemhing.

665
01:09:13,432 --> 01:09:17,569
l wish l were a boy.
- No, l like that you're a girl.

666
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:30,004
Anywa_, don't give up now, Gippi.
You can win this election.

667
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:35,268
Excuse me, Sister.
- Yes?

668
01:09:35,332 --> 01:09:37,934
May l?
- Sure!

669
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,801
Hi eveyone.

670
01:09:43,866 --> 01:09:47,202
l just wanted to finish
my introduction properly.

671
01:09:47,265 --> 01:09:49,100
l'm Gippi.

672
01:09:49,165 --> 01:09:52,368
l don't have any
medals or certificates.

673
01:09:52,432 --> 01:09:58,137
l suck at studies
and l can't play any sport.

674
01:09:58,199 --> 01:10:03,003
l can only do one thing well,
and that's dance!

675
01:10:05,032 --> 01:10:07,534
But you sawthat for yourself,
didn't you?

676
01:10:09,466 --> 01:10:13,937
And, let's admit it.
Most of you are like me.

677
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,237
We're not great at studies,
we hate sports.

678
01:10:18,299 --> 01:10:24,805
We think we're fat or ugly or stupid
and that eveyone is better than us.

679
01:10:24,866 --> 01:10:30,171
But trust me, it's not like that.
We're all the same.

680
01:10:32,299 --> 01:10:38,571
So, if you want your Head
Girl to be some great achiever,

681
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:40,401
then vote for Shamira.

682
01:10:40,466 --> 01:10:46,839
But if you want your Head Girl
to be like you, then vote for Gippi!

683
01:12:18,065 --> 01:12:21,368
The male reproductive
organ is called the penis.

684
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:27,035
lt is supported by
a pair of testicles.

685
01:12:27,232 --> 01:12:29,701
Silence class, silence!

686
01:12:29,766 --> 01:12:32,201
The testicles are...
- Excuse me, Ma'am.

687
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:33,366
Yes?

688
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:36,301
Ma'am today is my birthday.

689
01:12:36,366 --> 01:12:38,267
Oh, so sweet. Please come in.

692
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:44,368
Happy Birthday!

693
01:12:45,733 --> 01:12:47,801
So where were we?

694
01:12:47,866 --> 01:12:49,867
Ah! Testicles.

695
01:14:10,232 --> 01:14:12,667
Namaste.

696
01:14:20,199 --> 01:14:21,967
Why aren't you eating
anything, Booboo?

697
01:14:22,032 --> 01:14:24,868
l've been waiting for
the chicken tikka forever!

698
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:31,000
Shit!

699
01:14:31,532 --> 01:14:33,567
What's wrong?
- He's here!

700
01:14:33,733 --> 01:14:35,901
Who?
- Arjun!

701
01:14:36,165 --> 01:14:37,132
So what?

702
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,100
Let's leave, Mummy.
l don't want to meet him!

703
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,269
l'm sitting at my ex-husband's
wedding and you want to leave?

704
01:14:43,532 --> 01:14:44,699
Shut up and sit tight.

705
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,570
How are you, Pappi?
- Good, thanks.

706
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,701
l've had enough!

707
01:15:14,766 --> 01:15:17,034
Of what?
- Don't move!

708
01:15:17,099 --> 01:15:19,000
Gippi?

709
01:15:20,566 --> 01:15:23,001
Papa?
- Hi love, have you eaten yet?

710
01:15:23,065 --> 01:15:25,867
We're not here to eat, Papa!

711
01:15:28,933 --> 01:15:31,635
Don't you think you
should go talk to Mummy?

712
01:15:31,699 --> 01:15:33,634
lt wasn't easy for her to come here.

713
01:16:01,666 --> 01:16:03,701
We need to talk.

714
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:09,469
Whenever l run into you,
or think of you, l feel like shit.

715
01:16:09,532 --> 01:16:10,933
l...

716
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,570
No, it's not your fault.
l mean, you were kind of ajerk...

717
01:16:14,632 --> 01:16:17,501
... but l also acted
like a silly girl.

718
01:16:17,733 --> 01:16:19,468
l...

719
01:16:19,532 --> 01:16:25,938
So, l just wanted to say
that l'm over it. We're cool now.

720
01:16:26,032 --> 01:16:28,667
You're different. l like it.

721
01:16:28,733 --> 01:16:30,835
l know, l like it too.

722
01:16:31,532 --> 01:16:36,036
So, nowthat we're friends,
do you wanna hang out some time?

723
01:16:36,966 --> 01:16:39,068
Why don't you ty finding
girls your own age?

724
01:16:49,499 --> 01:16:53,469
Here's my Gippo!
Where did you run off to?

725
01:16:53,532 --> 01:16:56,701
l thought l'd give
you guys a moment alone.

726
01:16:56,766 --> 01:16:58,734

727
01:16:58,799 --> 01:17:01,034
She looks just like you, Pappi.

728
01:17:01,099 --> 01:17:05,570
Just this round little
nose is like mine.

729
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:12,806
Go call our little dumpling.
It's time for a family photograph!

730
01:17:13,332 --> 01:17:15,534
Smile eveyone!

731
01:17:22,933 --> 01:17:25,602
What a beautiful family!

732
01:17:33,632 --> 01:17:36,968
The voting will start
immediately after this assembly.

733
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,502
The counting will
be done tomorrow...

734
01:17:39,566 --> 01:17:43,703
... and the results will be
announced at the Christmas Party!

735
01:17:46,599 --> 01:17:50,035

740
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,735
Hi Gippi!
- What's up?

741
01:18:49,799 --> 01:18:50,966
Hi...

742
01:18:51,032 --> 01:18:54,769
l really love your hair, Gippi.
It's so...

743
01:18:54,899 --> 01:18:57,701
Soft! And your skin? Wow!

744
01:18:57,766 --> 01:18:58,900
Ok...

745
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:02,268
So listen, Gippi.
We've decided to help you.

746
01:19:02,332 --> 01:19:04,934
But the voting's over.
l don't need any help now!

Now is when you need us the most.

to go shopping with Anchal.

750
01:19:16,466 --> 01:19:17,733
Anchal?!

751
01:19:17,799 --> 01:19:21,435
Are you kidding? You can't become
Head Girl wearing some tacky ouflit!

752
01:19:21,499 --> 01:19:26,203
This isn't ajoke. Do you know how
important a Head Girl's image is?

753
01:19:26,265 --> 01:19:28,433
You desperately need our advice.

754
01:19:28,499 --> 01:19:29,800
We'll take you shopping today..

755
01:19:29,866 --> 01:19:32,301

757
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:41,404
Ew, let's go.
- See you later, Gips.

758
01:19:42,299 --> 01:19:43,733
What did these two want?

759
01:19:43,799 --> 01:19:47,469
l don't know... they wanted to
take me shopping, give me advice...

760
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:51,202
Huh? Maybe Shamira's
planning something.

761
01:19:51,532 --> 01:19:53,433
lsn't it too late for a plan?

762
01:19:53,466 --> 01:19:54,834
Hmm.

763
01:19:55,432 --> 01:19:58,468
Oh my God!
It could mean just one thing then!

764
01:19:58,532 --> 01:20:01,935
Even they think that
you're going to win. Shit!

765
01:20:02,199 --> 01:20:04,968
Are you really going to
become the Head Girl, Gippi?

766
01:20:09,265 --> 01:20:12,868
You know, they're right.
You should go shopping with them.

767
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:14,701
Lets not take any chances right now.

768
01:20:14,766 --> 01:20:17,401
But l promised you
we would go together.

769
01:20:17,466 --> 01:20:20,302
Just go. Don't wory about me.
l'll always be around.

770
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:33,702
Hi Gippi, we knewyou'd come.
- Let's go.

771
01:20:52,599 --> 01:20:53,666
No.

772
01:20:55,599 --> 01:20:56,800
No!

773
01:20:59,232 --> 01:21:01,434
Guys! Isn't this cool?

774
01:21:01,499 --> 01:21:03,334
No!!

775
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:12,334
Absolutely no milkshakes.

776
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:13,633
Only green tea.

777
01:21:32,232 --> 01:21:36,669
Oh my God, me?!
l can't believe this!

778
01:21:36,733 --> 01:21:40,837
This is like a dream come true!
Thank you! Thank you!

Wow, you look like a movie star!
- Thank you.

01:21:55,733 --> 01:21:57,367
Yeah, didi. You look hot!

783
01:21:57,632 --> 01:22:00,768
l better look hot.
l haven't eaten in days.

784
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,601
Stop dieting now.

785
01:22:02,666 --> 01:22:06,436
l've made your
favorite samosas today.

786
01:22:06,532 --> 01:22:10,702
But why?
You know l still have to lose 5 kgs.

787
01:22:10,733 --> 01:22:12,601
Don't wor_, Mummy.
l'll eat them all.

788
01:22:13,666 --> 01:22:18,670
Bye! All the best!
Good luck! l'll pray for you!

789
01:22:19,599 --> 01:22:21,701
l got you a gift.

790
01:22:21,766 --> 01:22:25,336
Junglee Hits?
Thank you!

791
01:22:25,666 --> 01:22:28,335
l thought our first
dance together...

792
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:31,735
...should be to your
favorite Shammi Kapoor's song.

793
01:22:32,099 --> 01:22:33,333
Choose one.

794
01:22:38,432 --> 01:22:42,335
Didn't you like the gift?

795
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:44,267
No, l love it.

796
01:22:45,432 --> 01:22:47,567
But... Kabir...

797
01:22:48,799 --> 01:22:52,169
l shouldn't do these
stupid dances anymore.

798
01:22:52,833 --> 01:22:56,469
Doesn't suit a Head Girl.
- Seriously?

799
01:22:56,532 --> 01:23:00,168
No, but l love all these songs!

800
01:23:00,232 --> 01:23:03,635
Tumne mujhe dekhaaa...

801
01:23:03,699 --> 01:23:06,368
Are you going to
be like this next year?

802
01:23:07,032 --> 01:23:11,436
What do you mean?
- You're already changed so much...

803
01:23:11,699 --> 01:23:13,600
And you haven't even
won the election yet.

804
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:16,568
Do you want me to always
be a laughingstock?

805
01:23:16,632 --> 01:23:21,136
Gippi, they were laughing with you,
not at you.

806
01:23:21,466 --> 01:23:23,501
That's why they voted for you.

807
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,135
Look at yourself.

808
01:23:26,199 --> 01:23:30,069
These shoes, this dress.
What have you done to your hair?

809
01:23:30,099 --> 01:23:32,134
Do you knowwho you remind me of?

810
01:23:33,366 --> 01:23:34,500
Shamira.

811
01:23:34,566 --> 01:23:37,502
So, what's wrong
with looking like her?

812
01:23:38,199 --> 01:23:43,737
Well, congratulations.
Mission accomplished.

813
01:24:27,466 --> 01:24:29,134
What's wrong, Shamira?

814
01:24:30,132 --> 01:24:34,202
What do you think?
You're going to win tonight.

815
01:24:34,265 --> 01:24:37,434
You know it.
l know it. Eveyone knows it.

816
01:24:37,499 --> 01:24:43,404
And you also knowthat you
have done nothing to deserve it.

817
01:24:43,632 --> 01:24:45,467
And what have you done?

818
01:24:45,599 --> 01:24:48,335
Besides humiliating
eveyone around you?

819
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:51,935
Oh really?
You think that's all l've done?

820
01:24:52,132 --> 01:24:54,701
Do you knowthat l
wake up at 5am eveyday?

821
01:24:54,933 --> 01:24:57,869
l take morning classes
to keep my grades up!

822
01:24:57,933 --> 01:25:01,603
And then at school,
while you sit around gossiping...

823
01:25:01,866 --> 01:25:07,204
... l manage clubs,
practice sports, hold conferences...

824
01:25:07,265 --> 01:25:10,134
l don't get a single moment off.

825
01:25:10,199 --> 01:25:13,635
My hair has to be perFect.
My skin has to be perFect.

826
01:25:13,899 --> 01:25:16,468
Even my goddamn socks
need to be perFect.

827
01:25:18,632 --> 01:25:21,368
Do you know,
l haven't had icecream in 3 years?

828
01:25:24,366 --> 01:25:27,268
And you're going
to become Head Girl noM

829
01:25:27,332 --> 01:25:29,100
Without doing any of this?

830
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:31,967
Do you even knowwhat
being a Head Girl means?

831
01:25:49,899 --> 01:25:51,900
Hi Gippi!
- Where were you?

832
01:25:51,966 --> 01:25:53,634
Gorgeous dress!

833
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:56,101
Have you guys seen Anchal?

834
01:25:56,165 --> 01:26:00,903
Oh my God! She's wearing the
most ridiculous dress! Come, come!

835
01:26:07,232 --> 01:26:10,068
Wow, Gippi.
You look so beautiful tonight.

836
01:26:10,566 --> 01:26:13,402
Wish we could say the same for you!

837
01:26:13,532 --> 01:26:16,268
A Head Girl can't be
seen with someone like that!

838
01:26:16,332 --> 01:26:19,068
ls that your grandma's dress?

839
01:26:19,232 --> 01:26:21,267
lsn't it hideous?

840
01:26:21,332 --> 01:26:25,335
Guys, l think she looks great!
- She obviously needs help.

841
01:26:25,399 --> 01:26:28,902
Tell her to go change, Gippi.
Maybe she'll listen to you.

842
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:34,135
Gippi... Say something...

843
01:26:36,132 --> 01:26:38,467
Children, children, children!

844
01:26:42,332 --> 01:26:47,937
lt gives me great joy to see you
all looking so beautiful and happy.

845
01:26:47,966 --> 01:26:52,303
Mery Christmas, all of you!

Gurpreet Kaur!

851

Actuall_, l wasn't interested
in this election at all.

855
01:28:05,766 --> 01:28:10,403
l signed up for it only because
Shamira challenged me to.

856
01:28:10,766 --> 01:28:15,670
l just wanted to show her that a
girl like me can also win something.

857
01:28:16,933 --> 01:28:21,671
l want to thank eveyone
who helped me win this election.

858
01:28:21,733 --> 01:28:25,369
My mother,
who has always inspired me.

859
01:28:25,432 --> 01:28:28,835
My brother,
who supports me in evemhing l do.

860
01:28:28,899 --> 01:28:31,968
And my best friend Anchal, who...

861
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:34,066
Hi!

862
01:28:43,332 --> 01:28:45,333
Who...

863
01:28:45,899 --> 01:28:48,801
Has always been there for me,
unconditionally.

864
01:28:50,165 --> 01:28:59,274
And who l was going to insult
publicl_, before this announcement.

865
01:29:04,032 --> 01:29:09,871
l'm so sor_, Anchal.
How could l be such an ass?

866
01:29:12,632 --> 01:29:15,601
l can never become Shamira.

867
01:29:21,733 --> 01:29:26,270
And you knowwhat?
l don't even want to!

868
01:29:27,899 --> 01:29:30,601
l don't want to stand
here and give a speech.

869
01:29:30,632 --> 01:29:34,002
l want to sit in the corner
with Anchal and crack stupid jokes.

870
01:29:34,065 --> 01:29:37,935
l want to take this uncomfortable
dress off and put pajamas on.

871
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,803
l don't want green tea!
l want my Mummy's samosas!

872
01:29:41,866 --> 01:29:45,236
l want to do silly Shammi
Kapoor dances with Kabir.

873
01:29:50,265 --> 01:29:53,368
l'm really sory guys,
if l'm letting you down.

874
01:29:53,632 --> 01:29:58,636
lf you ever need a friend,
l'm always here.

875
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:04,070
But for now... Sister, may l
please step back from the election?

876
01:30:19,733 --> 01:30:21,234
There. Go.

877
01:30:21,766 --> 01:30:25,002
Are you serious?
- Yeah, dude! Go!

878
01:30:26,766 --> 01:30:29,068
But, on one condition.

879
01:30:29,733 --> 01:30:33,703
Promise me that
you'll never be mean to me again.

880
01:30:34,065 --> 01:30:37,001
l can't promise anything,
but l'll ty.

881
01:30:37,065 --> 01:30:38,933
Great.
- Great.

882
01:30:47,065 --> 01:30:49,600
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!

883
01:30:51,232 --> 01:30:53,100
You wanna go to the after party?

884
01:30:53,299 --> 01:30:55,968
This party is so over.
