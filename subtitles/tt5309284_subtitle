1
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:46,680
IF

2
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,920
MIRRORSVILLE

3
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,800
Dance! Song! Comedy! Tragedy!

4
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,360
Come one! Come all!

5
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
Saala!

6
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,480
They prefer the idiot box to puppets!

7
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,120
What's the play about?

8
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,840
Not a play, good sirs! This is a tale!

9
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,320
A fairy tale, see?

10
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,120
Fairy tale?

11
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,480
How boring!

12
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,520
Is it a love story then?

13
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,560
Yes! Yes! Love, murder, fights...
It's all there!

14
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,880
You'll get your money's worth!

15
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,000
No ordinary tale this!
A foreign one!

16
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,960
Written by Lord Shakespeare himself!

17
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,360
Sex?
- No! No! Not sex!

18
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,760
People look only for sex these days!

19
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,440
I'm talking about Shakespeare Sahib!

20
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,440
Great writer!

21
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,760
A tale written by him!

22
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,240
Well…sex is there too…
in small doses

23
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,600
Watch and find out!

24
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,839
Take your places now.
The tale is about to start!

25
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,200
Come, good sirs...

26
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,680
let's take you to our fairytale land -

27
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,000
This then, is Arshinagar.
Mirrorsville!

28
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,480
Now don't ask where it is!

29
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,000
It could be anywhere in the world!

30
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,520
What's in a name?

31
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,880
A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet, right?

32
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,800
The fragrance of Mirrorsville slum too,
remains the same.

33
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,560
The fragrance of Mirrorsville slum too,
remains the same always!

34
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,240
Open drains!

35
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,920
Garbage spilling over!

36
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Have to cover your nose and walk!

37
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,600
But what of that?

38
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,480
All eyes are on Mirrorsville
slum right now

39
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,680
A new flyover is coming up, you see.

40
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,240
So all developers
have dreams of...

41
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,200
razing the slum &
building here then.

42
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,760
And truly, Mirrorsville
is a land of dreams!

43
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,320
Each person has a land of mirrors
inside his head!

44
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,119
Ever seen your selves
reflected there, good sirs?

45
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,120
No?

46
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,000
You will.
You surely will some day.

47
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:18,200
Meanwhile, let me introduce you
to the protagonists of this tale…

48
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,200
This is...

49
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,000
Rawna.

50
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,480
Rawnojoy Mitter.

51
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,160
The only son of
the Mitters of Mirrorsville.

52
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,320
Tch!

53
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,960
This is not a test of skill!

54
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,920
It's child's play!

55
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,920
So what do you want instead?

56
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,720
To blow off each child's head?

57
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,760
A sharp shooter...

58
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,960
but not interested in guns!

59
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,800
This young man's only interest is music!

60
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,400
The heroine -

61
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,800
Julie

62
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,720
Zulekha Khan

63
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,320
Beloved daughter
of the Khans of Mirrorsville

64
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,600
But, Good Lord!

65
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,920
What is she up to, this child
from a conservative Muslim home?

66
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,920
And this woman with her...

67
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,760
is her nurse Fatema.

68
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,040
Been looking after her since childhood.

69
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,360
Some looking after, this!

70
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,000
But wait!
There are more players here.

71
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,600
2 kings!

72
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,440
Here is King no 1

73
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,320
Name?
Bishwanath Mitter.

74
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,240
Occupation?
Real estate.

75
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Plus... underhand dealings in drugs.

76
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,320
Fortune favours the bold!

77
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,760
Sabir Khan.

78
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,240
Owner of Khan Constructions Ltd.

79
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,640
King no 2!
Reputed Muslim family.

80
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,720
But his goons too,
are involved in underhand drug deals.

81
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,800
Above all, Sabir Khan is the
prime enemy of Bishu Mitter.

82
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,280
Both have their sights
fixed on Mirrorsville slum.

83
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,880
Both wish to tear down the slum
& build highrises.

84
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,440
At present, the slum-dwellers
are fed up of their constant fights!

85
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,760
Come, listen for yourselves -

86
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,640
Hey Manik!
Another round of cha!

87
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,999
Gang wars will start
in about an hour!

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,079
Really, it's getting too much!

89
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,920
It's a theatre, not hutments as such.

90
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,800
From morning to night
we have drama!

91
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,880
Careful now!
That's a sharp new blade!

92
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,160
Brawling all morning,
can one keep one's head?

93
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,280
What is it today?
- Who can say!

94
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,440
Godforsaken fellows...

95
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,480
love stepping on each other's toes!

96
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,000
They'll drive us out from here,
God knows!

97
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,360
Both demand cuts!
What the hell, I say!

98
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,760
Just paid off one;
the other turns up today!

99
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,920
This simply can't go on!
They'll soon be dead and gone!

100
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,320
Knife one another & be done!

101
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,720
Like at the shindy yesterday...

102
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,960
almost at death's door Sunny lay!

103
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,680
You see that Tayeb Bro?

104
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,080
See how they bully the poor?

105
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,640
Where is it? Who?

106
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,880
Who else but those louts
– Sunny & Pappu!

107
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,840
Let's go check it out!

108
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,280
What's going on here?

109
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,400
Ah! You here too?

110
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,480
You & that cheat there
make a fine pair!

111
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,840
Shut up you piece of shit!

112
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,720
It's me who's in for it!
80 bucks lost before any sale!

113
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,880
You cheat on weight at
every turn of scale!

114
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,520
Short of cash? I'll be damned!
Now scram!

115
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,160
We have to taste the fruit
before we buy!

116
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,840
I took just one bite.
Awful stuff! So why…

117
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,480
…80 bucks? You bloody cheat!

118
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,560
What precious flower are you,
my sweet?

119
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Go quietly about your business.
If not…

120
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
If not…what?

121
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,480
Again!

122
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,280
Who asked you to pitch in, you smut?
- Enough!

123
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,960
Now quiet, everyone!

124
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,440
What do you think you're up to,
son of a gun?

125
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,920
Pick any poor man
and slit his throat for fun?

126
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,560
Come on Tayeb,
don't lose your cool so fast!

127
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,080
Mess with me, buddy…
you breathe your last!

128
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,720
You make my blood boil,
you pieces of slime!

129
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,520
From before our fathers' time
you've run us down...

130
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,480
without reason or rhyme!

131
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,920
Yet you are mere Mitters,
while we are Khans sublime!

132
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Yes?

133
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,040
Hello?

134
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,840
We're descendants of
Bahadur Shah The Great!

135
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,520
Ah! Now we've got it straight!

136
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,960
Not Shahrukh, nor Salman,
& yet he is a Khan!

137
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,440
Your dad was a refugee,
surnamed Akhtar!

138
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,520
Half crazy, bleary eyed, a Unani doctor.

139
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,000
How come you suddenly turned Khan?

140
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,600
Who's your real father now?
Are you your Uncle's son?

141
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,160
I swear to God,
your life is over & done!

142
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,520
If life is done, it's done
Be it knife we face, or gun

143
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,080
Come up if you dare
In a trice we'll slice you bare

144
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,840
In a trice we'll end your run!

145
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,040
At night in Mirrorsville
prowl hunters out to kill

146
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,160
No one knows when day will dawn
on Mirrorsville!

147
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Mirrorsville! Mirrorsville!

148
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,760
At night in Mirrorsville
all roads the mist will fill

149
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,040
Who knows when light will break
on Mirrorsville?

150
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Mirrorsville! Mirrorsville!

151
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,040
If life is done, it's done
Be it knife we face, or gun

152
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,440
Come up if you dare
In a trice we'll slice you bare

153
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,200
In a trice we'll end your run!

154
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Mirrorsville! Mirrorsville!

155
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:25,840
Mirrorsville! Mirrorsville!

156
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,120
Ah! Here at last on the scene!

157
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,160
What on earth d'you mean?

158
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,320
When we came,
just 4 years old was Tabbu

159
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,240
You brought him up.
He thinks of you as “Abbu”

160
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,320
He's like your son..
Hotheaded? Perhaps yes...

161
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,320
…but fought for you
& landed in a mess.

162
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,720
If you don't bail him out tomorrow…

163
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,960
You should have told us long ago
a nephew's a far cry!

164
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,600
Why, a sister, if a widow...
is not welcome any more!

165
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,880
What're you saying Sister!
You know well...

166
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,080
Tabbu's hot temper
is impossible to quell!

167
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,000
I've tried to reason with him in vain!

168
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,600
Grandma, you explain.

169
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,120
Look Sabir,
who else is there for a woman...

170
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,880
but father, husband or brother?
Tell me then…

171
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,400
if Julie were in trouble,
God forbid...

172
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,480
could you rest until
you came to her aid?

173
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,440
Shh my child, shh!

174
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,600
You're responsible for him,
his guardian!

175
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,000
Go find a way
to get him out of prison!

176
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,120
Easy for the old woman to say!

177
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,680
But, the person needed for that…

178
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,000
…is a most dangerous one!

179
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,680
Not King, nor Knave...

180
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,440
an Ace!

181
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,440
Tayeb will surely kill me one day!

182
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,360
My image is tattered,
my reputation at stake!

183
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,960
Lost his father early.
Now a spoilt brat!

184
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,360
Can't control his temper,
that's what.

185
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,040
Sabir Saab, must loving care
make a monkey of a lad?

186
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,600
Then what's the use of culture,
tell me that?

187
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,120
But Tayeb isn't really a bad sort

188
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,320
At this age their heads
just get too hot!

189
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,080
Isn't the Police Commissioner
your friend…?

190
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,840
That fellow Tayeb knifed,
is he on the mend?

191
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,240
Not come to yet.
It was deep, the wound!

192
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,799
What's his name again?
Think they call him Sunny…

193
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,920
Tayeb needs a lesson,
I know that better than any…

194
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,040
I'll teach him good & proper…

195
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,800
First pray to Allah Miya...

196
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,680
that Sunny survives!
If not, I greatly fear...

197
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,600
that Tayeb will be
charged with murder

198
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,520
And your image tarnished further!

199
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,520
True, I could ask the Commissioner if I…

200
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,319
But hide any facts, & you deal with
RTI (Right to Information)!

201
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,360
I understand sir.
With Elections ahead…

202
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,480
one mis-step,
& you're as good as dead!

203
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,280
These are mere trifles anyhow.

204
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,040
Okay, I'll take your leave now.

205
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,800
Oh! Do call us if you need anything...

206
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,840
…before the Elections, we mean!

207
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:30,360
Come now, Sabir Saab
your business is mine too!

208
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,560
Let me see what I can do…

209
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,280
Friendship is above any law after all!

210
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,160
Hey you!

211
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,920
Give the Commissioner a call.

212
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,920
If it hadn't been for Grandma, I'd prefer
for Tayeb to stay in the stir.

213
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,360
A real taste of prison...

214
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,600
…would soon make him see reason!

215
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,840
True.
But Tayeb has his uses too.

216
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,400
By the way, Manmohan still won't sell

217
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,800
Even doubling our price didn't jell.

218
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,160
Says the house holds
memories of his mother!

219
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,920
But sell he must, or we're in lather!

220
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh go on, Mirza saab!

221
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,480
If the price is right,
anyone will sell!

222
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,160
Not always for money!
Well…

223
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,200
…guess you'll know
when you're as old as me.

224
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,520
So think of some other strategy!

225
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,199
Surely Manmohan
has some weak spot?

226
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,920
Send someone to find out what!

227
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,280
Who would you say?

228
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,400
Who...

229
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,200
Okay! Okay!

230
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,120
Send Tayeb if there's no other way.

231
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,040
Inside my heart a highway
There you race your jeep

232
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,120
I dare you to stop
when you reach my parched lips

233
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,320
Inside my heart a highway
There you race your jeep

234
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,800
I dare you to stop
when you reach my parched lips

235
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,840
Water, fire, earth or sky -
nothing do I fear

236
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,320
Place your hand in mine
& see where we go from here

237
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,760
My reckless heart is ready to dare

238
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,320
All for your love...

239
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,960
No! No! It's all wrong!

240
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,560
Saala! Same old crossline,
same chords all along!

241
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,760
Shit! No new words,
no tune with any grit!

242
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,680
Need a great punchline now!

243
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,800
Where's our writer anyhow?

244
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,880
Ah! The gifted one! Wow!

245
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,280
Look Montey, if you come
leave that stuff behind

246
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,200
Those bloody reefers
have you in a bind!

247
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,560
Art minus dope?
No hope!

248
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,080
You don't touch the stuff
so your punchline has no punch!

249
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,840
This club is for music,
not for getting high!

250
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,680
Stuck for a punchline?
Wait...

251
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,160
I love you...

252
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,640
I love you...

253
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,960
jaan qubool!
(on my life I swear)

254
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
Write!

255
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,360
My reckless heart is ready to dare

256
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,120
Baby I love you, on my life I swear

257
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,240
Baby I love you, on my life I swear

258
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,640
Jaan qubool!

259
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
Yesss!

260
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,960
What's up then?

261
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,360
That f... er is free again!

262
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,039
All of them are f... ers,
who has any class?

263
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,440
Who do you mean?

264
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,880
Tayeb. Bloody ass!

265
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,120
How? The jail
isn't owned by his father!

266
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,240
In a way it is rather!

267
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,840
Saala! Wait till I catch the f... er!

268
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,240
Listen, cut it out!
Just don't open your mouth!

269
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,320
Sunny almost died then!
Don't you stir up trouble again!

270
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,160
You're the one
who caused it all, bugger!

271
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,320
Insulted his uncle, father, mother…

272
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,480
& here's Rawna, playing it so cool!

273
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,840
Strumming your guitar!
Drop it, fool!

274
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,040
Wait till you get home &
hear your ass split!

275
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,760
I hate my dad's job & you know it.

276
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,520
What d'you have for brains,
you twit?

277
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,160
You're his f... ing heir!
You'll get it all, you slob!

278
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,760
As they say in English,
'This is not my job!'

279
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,480
You know the business,
you take it on.

280
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,160
For Rawna...
it's just guitar and song.

281
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,760
You're bang on there,
Biloo my dear!

282
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,720
Our Romeo here faces
misery, I fear

283
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,240
The Boss is hopping
mad at him I hear!

284
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,800
And you?
Jamming here for 2 days flat!

285
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,680
Your dad's on uncle's payroll -
ever think of that?

286
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,320
Hey, don't take his father's name
in vain!

287
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,400
Let him, saala, let him.
It's no f... ing pain.

288
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,160
Saala!

289
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,800
Silence!

290
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,680
Boss says we're in a spot!

291
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,320
27 crates of pot
will be offloaded soon at the port

292
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,600
If we don't corner
them in time...

293
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,320
they'll be whisked off by
Tayeb, that slime!

294
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,120
For Mirrorsville slum
to turn to Mirrorsville Tower...

295
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,840
we must move in fast.
Before the Khans grab power!

296
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,120
Rawna, you must be part of this task!

297
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,960
You know I won't. Why ask?

298
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,120
But…where will the slum-dwellers go?

299
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,000
Oh dear...

300
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,760
Somewhere... anywhere...
It's always been so.

301
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,160
Can't we avoid all this, Bro?

302
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Saala!

303
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,000
Such a super marksman!

304
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,320
Yet he chooses guitar over gun!

305
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,040
Aw f... off & be done!

306
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,880
Ya Allah!
How long has this been brewing?

307
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,320
Nearly a month now...
or so she's saying.

308
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,520
Oh great!

309
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,440
She says & you listen?

310
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,440
Some mother you are!

311
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,240
How did she have the guts?

312
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,400
You let her go too far!

313
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,200
Why, her sisters never did
any such thing!

314
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,920
Granny dear...

315
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:19,120
the times are changing!

316
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,840
Besides, both live in America now.

317
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,760
Who knows what they're up to anyhow?

318
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,600
Spoil her then!
She always was your pet!

319
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,600
No one will marry her I'll bet!

320
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,839
High-bred Muslim girl,
marked for life!

321
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,880
May Allah forgive!

322
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,119
At least it's just a tattoo.
Not as bad as rings!

323
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,240
Know where they wear those things?

324
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Here.

325
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
Here.

326
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Here.

327
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,240
Want to know where else?

328
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,800
Listen carefully…

329
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,960
Shame! Shame! Chhi!

330
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,120
See how tongues wag after this!

331
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,080
Other boys come home at night at least.

332
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,480
And where might our
Young Lord be?

333
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,160
Out on an all-night spree!

334
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,760
Got stuck somewhere may be…

335
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,440
Stuck meaning…what?

336
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,720
Phone off. God knows where he's at!

337
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,960
It's all your fault!

338
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,240
Spoil him some more!

339
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,240
Better stop that dance class of yours!

340
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,440
If only you'd give him some time...

341
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,280
So now the fault is mine?

342
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,960
Haven't I begged you to
stop your business?

343
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,440
Drugs, protection money & the rest?

344
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,480
Madhu, you know very well I can't!

345
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,800
It's a one-way street!

346
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,039
Besides, it's all in a snarl.

347
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
Ah, there you are, your Lordship!

348
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,880
Thought suddenly of home?

349
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,640
Parents are just pests.

350
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,120
Who cares if they're alive or dead?

351
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,000
Friends, guitar, shows!

352
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,320
Stuck in the same class 4 years in a row!

353
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,760
Can't show our faces in public,
you shame us so!

354
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,720
Stop it. He's just come home…

355
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,400
No, I won't! I've had enough!
Let him...

356
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,479
learn the ropes,
or I'll throw him out on a limb!

357
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,000
This huge business, who is it for?

358
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,320
You tell your clever son
– a genius for sure!

359
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,040
Ok I'm off.

360
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,560
Put this away with care

361
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,240
25 K in there

362
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,960
'Will you marry me?'

363
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,440
Amina?

364
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,440
So jaan...

365
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,480
all ready for the party?

366
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,960
Just ordered the sweets.

367
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,760
Some costumes - two or three -
… aren't ready yet.

368
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,520
Everything else is done.

369
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,720
What about your guest list?
Left out no one?

370
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,040
Left out...?

371
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,920
None.
But there is one special guest...

372
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,200
and for you, I have a request -

373
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,800
This evening from Dubai,
comes Parvez

374
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,600
Plan a special menu
for him please!

375
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,720
I dream of marrying him to
our Zuleika…

376
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,840
Dream all you like...

377
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,200
but it's all in the
hands of Allah!

378
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,360
After Julie's wedding,
we'll go for Haj, we two...

379
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,840
Will your daughter agree?

380
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,719
Must consider that too!

381
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,160
Hear that Julie?
You're to be wedded soon!

382
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,840
What! Hitch me to that
grey-haired buffoon?

383
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,839
Think I'll marry him?
No way!

384
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,920
My brain is still working,
eyesight's still okay!

385
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,600
You heard your Dad!
Parvez is the chosen one …

386
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,080
Oh lump it Fati!
Wait and watch the fun!

387
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,000
Abbu & his old-world notion!

388
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,616
Marry off the daughter & go on Haj!
As though it's a magic potion!

389
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,000
But his daughter's dreams
are ready to take wing

390
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,639
She'll fly away one day
and stop at nothing

391
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:35,040
Fly where she's unshackled,
& countless dreams concur

392
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:42,079
Where her Prince Charming
is waiting for her.

393
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,840
Visit the Khan house
to see your princess?

394
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,000
Rawna thinks he's Spiderman,
no less!

395
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,240
Rawna fears nothing
on land or sea or mall.

396
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,120
An all-girl play!
It's sure to be a ball!

397
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,840
Pretty little missies
dancing in a row!

398
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,920
Just have to take photos
of the Khan Mahal show!

399
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,280
Never seen a girl before?
Stop being such a lech!

400
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,319
For this you'll dare the lion's den?
That's a bit of a stretch!

401
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,160
Sunny's neck still has marks
you know!

402
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,560
Don't you even plan to go!

403
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,680
No case, no hitch!

404
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,760
Where the girls are,
Rawna too must go!

405
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,560
Let's see who can stop him,
which ordinance, or law!

406
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,240
Bugger!

407
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,200
If that happens Uncle,
I swear I'll go berserk!

408
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,520
Tayeb! What's up?
Finished all your work?

409
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,000
All done. The Eid party
will proceed as planned...

410
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,520
but if they come too,
well…I'll be damned!

411
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,520
Who're you talking about?

412
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,800
That Mitter boy! The lout!

413
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,000
He'll bend but not break,
he's that stubborn!

414
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,359
You're so generous,
you invite everyone!

415
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,080
But must we have them too,
those bloody hooligans?

416
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,400
I'm telling you straight,
if they dare cross the gate…

417
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,999
…you won't do a thing!

418
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,479
Must you rise to every bait?

419
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,200
Got arrested the other day
for knifing that guy at the fair!

420
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,280
I had to plead
with the Commissioner!

421
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,600
Cause any more trouble,
God help you!

422
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,640
I'm telling you, today
no trouble will you brew!

423
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,440
Najma, listen dear -

424
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,759
Zulekha turns a deaf ear
to all I say.

425
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,440
You tell her - no male role
or moustache for her today!

426
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,960
Parvez wants to see her
directly after the play.

427
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,240
They say all the girls will be
dressed up as men?

428
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,920
So Rawna, what's the point
of your going then?

429
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,120
Rawna's eyes can clearly tell
a girl from a guy

430
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,400
To enter the lion's den
you must bid your fears goodbye!

431
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,240
Well then, Parvez?

432
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,360
What news of business?

433
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,440
By Allah's blessings
and your good will...

434
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,880
the going has been great.
But it's made me greyer still!

435
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,799
Time's on your side now -
a racehorse unstoppable!

436
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,120
Now If Zuleikha is
willing & tractable…

437
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,760
I'll finalize the wedding before I go...

438
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,040
Sure!

439
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,600
She likes you, I know.
And yet...

440
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,560
she's still so young!
Be prepared to adjust...

441
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,999
No problem Sir.

442
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,280
I was wondering...

443
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,200
if there's any good land
here for the taking.

444
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,519
So now I have to pour dye
on that greybeard's hair!

445
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,120
What?

446
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,160
Come on quick!
Uncle wants you there.

447
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,240
You go ahead Bro.

448
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,920
I... I'll come in a minute or so.

449
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,600
Please Aunty! Quick!
Let's hide & play a trick!

450
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,080
Now...

451
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,519
I'll hide behind
the curtain over there.

452
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,160
Please Aunty,
you're not to tell anyone I'm here!

453
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,320
Abbu's chosen Parvez, It's clear...

454
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,599
O Ma! What's this! A crook!

455
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Don't scream! Don't scream!

456
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,439
If they find me,
they'll change the way I look!

457
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,080
Wh-who are you?
Where from?

458
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,759
I'm Ronojoy.
Bishu Mitter's son.

459
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,960
Ya Allah! Mitter!
Shhh! Shhh! Shhh!

460
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,440
Not so loud!

461
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,680
If they find us, it'll be a clincher!

462
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,239
And who may you be?

463
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:20,400
Sabir Khan's daughter.
Zulekha. Julie.

464
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,200
You live in Mirrorsville too?
A 'Parhosi'?

465
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,160
Parhosi? You mean neighbour?

466
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,800
Oh God! They're here!!!

467
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,319
Julie! What's going on, pray?

468
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,879
15 minutes in the toilet?
Come out I say!

469
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,080
Oh dear!

470
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,720
Oh my God! Such a tummy ache!

471
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,800
And liquid potty! Uff!

472
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,640
He'll kill us both! Shh!

473
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,479
No acting today for me!

474
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,679
Please Tabbu Bhai, ask them to
replace me with…

475
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,680
Simi!

476
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,640
Excuse me!

477
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,920
Bless you!

478
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:55,640
Julie baby, open the door!
I've brought you medicine…

479
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:06,040
Don't need it Ammijaan,
I have it here with me.

480
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,040
I feel, I feel…I can hold him
but he eludes my embrace

481
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,840
O he lives so near my place…

482
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:27,600
There's a Mirrorland beside my home

483
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:33,520
A neighbour lives near me...

484
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:42,640
whom never with my eyes I see

485
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:09,360
If this neighbour should
ever touch me...

486
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:29,880
my hellish woes would forever flee

487
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,400
So Shiraj & Lalan live side by side

488
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:47,560
Yet a million miles apart!

489
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,720
A neighbour lives near me...

490
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:02,880
Whom never with my eyes...

491
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,280
do I see

492
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:22,120
There's a Mirrorland beside my home

493
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,320
A neighbour lives near me…

494
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:37,320
Whom never with my eyes do I see…

495
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,320
So? Who did you get to see?

496
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,640
Which bud captured your heart?
Rose or jasmine?

497
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,560
Neither rose nor jasmine,
oh gosh!

498
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,280
On her upper lip,
a light moustache…

499
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,200
What? A moustached miss!

500
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,920
You risked 3 lives for this?

501
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,880
We nearly got pickled!

502
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,480
Oooh! How it tickled!

503
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,480
Tickled? Oh gee!

504
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,520
Did you, or did she?

505
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,640
All three bastards are
here in the garden!

506
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,680
They mustn't escape!
Set the dogs on them!

507
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,600
What now, my friend?

508
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,560
Run before they start a mayhem!

509
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,400
Run! This way! This way!

510
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,040
Slowly! Slowly!

511
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,320
Carefully!

512
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,040
Biloo? Montey?

513
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,960
Where the f... k are they?

514
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,560
God keep you

515
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,360
Good night

516
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,480
Take the dogs away. Go!

517
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,560
Where the hell has Rawna gone?

518
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,880
Gone on ahead for sure.
Run on, run on!

519
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,600
Wait! We're not done!

520
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,160
Too much light here saala!
Keep aiming, come on!

521
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,800
Good shot, saala!

522
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,560
There's a Mirrorland beside my home

523
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:58,800
A neighbour lives near me…

524
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:07,320
Whom never with my eyes...

525
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,160
do I see

526
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:19,040
Whom never with my eyes...

527
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,400
do I see

528
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,760
Rawno…

529
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,000
Rawnojoy…

530
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,600
If ever we meet, what joy!

531
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,960
But who knows how
far away you are…

532
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,040
Here! Right here!

533
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,800
Julie! What's wrong with you?

534
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,400
His voice still rings in your ear?

535
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,360
Not wrong, here I am.

536
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,960
Go on, sing again for me!

537
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,240
You climbed up that pipe?

538
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,480
Are you crazy?

539
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,800
Listen! I want to see you again!

540
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,360
So do I, but when?

541
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,520
How?

542
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,400
Where?
- Where?

543
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,200
Give me your number!
I'll call you tonight…

544
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,320
Give me your hand, let me write…

545
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,920
First time?

546
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,280
What d'you mean...?

547
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,600
How could you tell?

548
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,600
Rawna knows all this quite well!

549
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,040
Eesh! Very smart!
You'll get a smack for sure!

550
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,400
Let me show you how...

551
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,960
Come!

552
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,240
Once more…

553
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,600
Your lips were closed
the first time!

554
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,160
Now you're learning just fine!

555
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,520
Ok, ok! That's enough!
Now you'd better go!

556
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,920
But how will you get out?

557
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,480
By now the gates are closed!

558
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,040
Don't worry.

559
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,200
These walls are easy to scale.

560
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,400
Hurry up! It's really late!

561
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,000
I'll text you tonight without fail.

562
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,960
Julie bibi!
Your Ammi wants you.

563
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,080
Coming Fati!

564
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,000
Bye Rawno.
Please be careful!

565
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,240
Julie! Your mother is waiting!

566
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,640
Shhh! Fati! Go inside.
I said I'm coming!

567
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,200
Take care, Rawno.
Text me first thing!

568
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,680
Can't sleep tonight!

569
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,560
All your fault Khan!

570
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,520
All your fault Mitter!
My slumber too, is gone!

571
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,560
What morons we are!
We missed our chance!

572
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,760
Curse these hands of mine!

573
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,240
Should've guessed before.

574
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,240
3 grown men in burkhas
come to wine & dine!

575
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,160
Don't talk like a jerk!
Could've been guests too!

576
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:01,240
Right! Pull off burkhas at random,
get beaten black and blue!

577
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,400
Not beaten then – but now!

578
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,000
Cool it Tayeb bro!

579
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,680
A knife is outdated.

580
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,640
Time you got a gun!

581
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,720
He who shoots from a distance
is a coward's son!

582
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,640
Come Tungsten, come & fight!

583
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,440
It's a real turn on!

584
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,760
Sharp at 8 o'clock
offloading starts at the dock

585
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,240
My informer tells me Tayeb's lot
will be present at the spot...

586
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,480
to corner all the stock.

587
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,200
We're ready to resist,
we'll flay their butts!

588
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,360
They'll forget their fathers' names
if they mess with us!

589
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,760
Sunny, you will take the lead.

590
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,240
Murli, Pappu - cover!

591
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,119
The rest create a shindy...
they come close, they suffer!

592
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:34,960
All pepped up I see,
but keep your senses keen.

593
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:40,400
Not just a few broken bones,
I'll sweep Khan's business clean!

594
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,680
And Santosh...

595
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,520
get Montey into the grind.

596
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:51,800
And look at that son of mine!
Posing like a lover divine!

597
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,400
Faffing all day
with ganja and guitar!

598
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,240
Saala!
If only he'd take after his father!

599
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,240
Did you hear that, boy?
Any more to say?

600
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,400
Still a milksop baby?
Do I run after you all day?

601
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,040
When will you start working?
Once your father's dead and gone?

602
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,480
I'm ashamed you are my son!

603
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,280
There you go again!

604
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,120
Enough! Say no more!

605
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,480
For this operation,
you must be first to score!

606
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,880
What if the police come Boss?

607
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:28,160
Any idea how much moolah
to the police we toss?

608
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,080
That policeman is my pet boy,
the OC or whatever...

609
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,480
I'll strip him of his uniform
if he tries to get too clever!

610
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,040
Need any more briefing?
Everyone clear?

611
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,720
Good!
Now get out of here!

612
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,280
Hey you!

613
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,440
Lover-boy!
You must be there on the day

614
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,280
No more sponging on Dad
& spending time in play!

615
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,680
Get down to business,
start learning hands on.

616
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,600
You heard me?

617
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,080
Now be gone.

618
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,040
Please Manik, half a cup!

619
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,080
I'm so thirsty…

620
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,320
Want it for free?

621
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,760
You know how it is bro!
All pockets are empty!

622
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,120
May you be showered
with blessing
- Saala!

623
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,680
This priest will break our faith,
someone do something!

624
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,080
This daily dose of holy water
& mantra chanting…

625
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,256
…drowns our Muslim call to prayer
every single evening!

626
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,760
Just morning and evening!

627
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,920
Not five times a day!

628
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,560
Blaring on loudspeakers
so Allah can hear you pray!

629
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,360
Mangal, you'll get it today,
this is too much for me!

630
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,040
Now I'm going to mix
some poison in your tea!

631
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,960
Swearing matches every day!
Go somewhere else, I say.

632
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,280
Yet you can't do without
each other anyway!

633
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,560
Ah! There you are Salim Sahib!

634
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,199
Fighting again?
Really you two!

635
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,079
But this slum would be
insipid without you!

636
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,200
Welcome Salim Sahib,
how about some chai?

637
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,600
Has Manik ever made
any chai that's worthwhile?

638
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,240
See Salim Sahib, what I get
for giving things free?

639
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,840
Forget it Manik,
this time the total bill's on me.

640
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,320
Not at all.
I'll make you a special one.

641
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,640
Well okay.

642
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,960
As soon as school starts,
I'll do a practice run.

643
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,920
Babur, Humayun, Shahjahan…

644
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,200
No silly!

645
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,080
Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jehangir...

646
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,200
then Shahjahan!

647
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,560
What did I say then?

648
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,400
They'll break our shacks
& build a mall!

649
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,840
The black money men!

650
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,880
Saala! Black money men!

651
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,840
Black money men!
Saala! Black money men!

652
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,360
We, the poor, will lose our homes

653
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,040
On the streets we'll have to roam

654
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,040
We, the poor, will lose our homes

655
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,920
On the streets we'll have to roam

656
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,320
The rascals will be happy only then!

657
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:30,400
Black money men!
Saala! Black money men!

658
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,680
Black money men!
Saala! Black money men!

659
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,960
No point in swearing,
think what you can do

660
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,560
Thinking won't help you!

661
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,720
The schoolhouse owner's happy
his rent was too low.

662
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,400
He's made big money
selling off, I know!

663
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,000
But if they pay good money...

664
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,759
we may as well go.

665
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,760
Where will you go?
Just where will you go?

666
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,360
To heaven or to hell?
Do you even know?

667
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:11,279
What do we have but Mirrorsville slum
to call our own?

668
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,480
Swear at them all you can!

669
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,880
Will your luck turn even then?

670
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,280
We swear at them all we can!
Will our luck turn even then?

671
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,600
Only Allah knows
what luck we'll have, and when!

672
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:33,400
Black money men!
Saala! Black money men!

673
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,600
Black money men!

674
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,720
Saala! Black money men!

675
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,760
Just hang on to your land,
take my advice.

676
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,200
When the flyover comes up,
you can name your price!

677
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,800
Why not go to the cops,
hear what they say?

678
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,640
Only money talks!

679
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,240
Only money walks!

680
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,160
They only matter,
who can enter malls & pay

681
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:03,880
Our rice is full of gravel,
the system here is rotten!

682
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,880
And it's all because of
those black money men!

683
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:12,520
Saala! Black money men!

684
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,520
Black money men!
Saala! Black money men!

685
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,120
We who work from
house to house...

686
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,000
where do we go from here?

687
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,960
Julie's mother said,
I happened to overhear…

688
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,240
…how dirty our slum is!
Filth everywhere!

689
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,840
If Mirrorsville goes...

690
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,600
she'll have cut off
her own nose!

691
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,400
Where else will they get...

692
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,040
such a cheap labour source?

693
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:42,480
Dammit! It's no use!
I'll get out of here!

694
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,800
Settle somewhere far away,
become a puppeteer.

695
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,400
Say what you will...

696
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,520
not an inch will we give!

697
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,360
Even if they kill!

698
00:54:52,361 --> 00:54:56,279
Trample on our pride,
& we'll cut off your feet!

699
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,279
It's our right to live!
That's all we need!

700
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,640
We'll not be kicked around!
We will stand our ground!

701
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:10,440
Try to take our land,
we'll fight you to the end

702
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,920
You black money men!

703
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:22,280
Saala! Black money men!

704
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,800
Where? When?
I can hardly wait!

705
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,800
Tomorrow evening,
5 o'clock straight

706
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,080
Aha! So Miss Julie
has found a lover too!

707
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,880
Hey Julie!
May we know who?

708
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,160
Wrong, you guys!

709
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,760
It's Aunty!
Showering texts on me!

710
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,880
Just got a new
mobile phone you see…

711
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:09,600
Now listen! What're you
doing this evening?

712
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,840
If you're free, come to the
Sporting Club fling?

713
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,920
What's on at Sporting Club?
Oh! Silver Jubilee!

714
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,120
Rawno's singing!
Thanks for reminding me!

715
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,400
It starts around 8.30,
but we'll reach early, what?

716
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,600
On the dot!

717
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,520
My God Rawno… He's so hot!

718
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,520
Rawno…?
Who's he?

719
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,440
Bishwanath Mitter's son.
What a looker, gee!

720
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,440
Superb singer,
a little Bollywoody…

721
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,839
You won't understand, honey!
You're into classical

722
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,400
Miss Goody-Goody!

723
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,040
Nonsense! If it's good,
one can hear anything.

724
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:45,320
I'll go too & check out
how your precious Rawno sings!

725
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,240
Inside my heart a highway
There you race your jeep

726
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:10,960
I dare you to stop
when you reach my parched lips

727
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:23,840
Hey, inside my heart a highway
There you race your jeep

728
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,119
I dare you to stop
when you reach my parched lips

729
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:32,839
Water, fire, earth or sky –
nothing do I fear

730
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:37,320
Place your hand in mine
& see where we go from there

731
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:42,280
My reckless heart
is ready to dare

732
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:46,960
Baby I love you,
on my life I swear

733
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,640
Oh my God!
You know each other! Really?

734
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,400
No! Never! Crazy?

735
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,880
He waved at you just now!
Since when…?

736
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,680
Nonsense! Can't be me
Someone behind us then!

737
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:15,080
The world builds barricades
to block out my heart

738
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,719
All because of you
I've broken them apart

739
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:23,640
The world builds barricades
to block out my heart

740
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:28,120
All because of you
I've broken them apart

741
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,599
I ignore all anger
I forget all fear

742
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:38,880
I'm lying on a pyre,
place your head on my heart here

743
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:45,840
My eyes heed no warning
I'll pay for it, no fear

744
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:52,120
Baby I love you,
on my life I swear

745
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,680
Whatever my heart
will not accept...

746
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,040
I will not be forced to do.

747
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,960
But I'll walk through fire...

748
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:23,519
just to be with you.

749
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,840
Whiplashes cannot stop me

750
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:32,400
Despite my wounds I smile

751
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:37,400
All this because
my love for you...

752
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,880
makes it all worthwhile

753
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,120
Nobody must know about us,
not a thing!

754
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,119
Okay, they won't.

755
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,360
5 tomorrow evening!

756
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,800
Fate's decree is indelible

757
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,960
Yet overwrite it, O my Master

758
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,760
No, no.

759
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,240
Your F-Sharp wasn't quite…

760
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,520
Try again.

761
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,520
Get the note right!

762
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,960
Hey! Prince of love!

763
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,120
Should you smoke so much?

764
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,280
By the time Julie comes out...

765
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,600
the smoke will
blacken your lungs!

766
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,800
You can only love if you live!

767
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,160
A dead man has nothing to give!

768
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,720
Arrey!
Now don't chuck that, you!

769
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,240
Me Fatema.
I'm the one who...

770
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,720
brought up Julie
since she was a mite!

771
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,520
15 years, Mister...

772
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:04,120
morning, noon & night,
I've been Julie Bibi's
shadow.

773
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,120
So tell me sir...

774
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:11,600
just passing time,
or do you really love her?

775
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,720
There's Julie!

776
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,520
I'll wait right here,
come back quickly!

777
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:44,760
You know Papa,
Uncle picked me up from school

778
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:50,560
We had ice - cream…& chocolates…
Oh, it was so cool!

779
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:55,560
Then he took me for a ride
on his motorbike…

780
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:59,799
Whoosh!
I was flying through the air!

781
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:07,040
Please Papa, buy a bike!
Much cooler than a car!

782
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,400
How very irregular!

783
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,200
The school let her go
with a complete stranger?

784
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:17,520
Why stranger?
Uncle came from your office

785
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,760
I recognized the pass!

786
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,640
The school pass!

787
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,360
That's right.

788
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,520
Your driver had it, you can ask.

789
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,800
What! You must sack him today!
Damn!

790
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:32,320
That would be
a big mistake, Ma'am!

791
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,560
Anushka...

792
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,520
go ask someone
to bring some water for me

793
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,840
A very loyal employee!

794
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,440
Just wouldn't hand over the pass!

795
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,080
In the end…

796
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,280
I recommend
you call an ambulance.

797
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,400
I left him bleeding profusely!
- What!

798
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,280
Who the hell are you?

799
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,600
Sit down, Gupta-ji.

800
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:10,200
Why so angry?

801
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,240
What does all this mean?

802
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,200
That is not clear!

803
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,320
Oh yes!

804
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:24,880
On the sale deed for this house...

805
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,240
just a signature.

806
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,560
Right here…

807
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,720
Khan Constructions!

808
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,800
But I've already...

809
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,320
…what's his name?

810
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,840
Mirza…
- Right, Mirza!

811
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,440
I've told him
this house is not for sale!

812
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,680
You see, this house for me...

813
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:45,120
holds memories of your mother!
Such a pity!

814
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,960
But maintaining this old place
is a problem surely?

815
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:59,920
But think it through by all means…
I am in no hurry.

816
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:05,120
Ah, Miss Anushka's here too!

817
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:09,480
Remember the knife
I promised I'd show you?

818
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:11,680
No Anushka! No!
Come inside, to your room!

819
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,600
Why? I'm going to see
Uncle's knife, that's all…

820
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,520
Want to see what it can do?

821
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,280
Even though it's so small…

822
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,240
See…?

823
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,680
What…?

824
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,560
What?

825
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:02,680
My song last evening... what did you think?

826
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,200
Honestly?

827
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,760
Great! Terrific!

828
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,800
But you don't really like
that kind of music?

829
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:15,560
Not true!
Jaan qubool is so romantic!

830
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,400
Romance!

831
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,840
Really?

832
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,480
You understand romance?

833
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,080
You're still so very young!

834
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,720
You're a great looker...

835
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,959
but your voice is like birdsong!

836
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,280
I'm a good deal older
than you miss!

837
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,120
But...

838
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:35,640
if two minds are in tune,
what can be amiss?

839
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,000
Um…I mean…

840
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,760
…you go to music school too.

841
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,320
Classic?

842
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,720
The word is classical,
not classic!

843
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,560
Yes…I do sing a bit

844
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,880
Beautiful voice!

845
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,800
That day I loved it!

846
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,720
Currently, I'm learning qawwali

847
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,680
Qawwali?

848
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,120
What's that?

849
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,839
About bawaali (streetfight)
I'm canny

850
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,680
You're so funny!

851
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,520
Ok, ok! I get the drift!

852
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,840
So sing a qawwali

853
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,800
There's no one around.

854
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,040
The shrine is empty.

855
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:18,600
But... you won't like it maybe…

856
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,000
Hey!

857
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,520
What do you think of me?

858
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,640
Uneducated?

859
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,920
Crass?

860
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,440
Don't appreciate serious stuff?

861
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:27,800
An ass?

862
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,160
Did I say that?

863
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,960
Zuleikha Khan...

864
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:39,000
in the past half hour
you haven't said a thing!

865
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:42,360
After taking so much trouble,
coming out so far…

866
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:47,440
…all you do is
twist your 'dupatta' (scarf)?

867
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:12,600
Fate's decree is indelible
Yet overwrite it, O my Master

868
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:32,280
Where, oh where,
should I search for you?

869
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:40,600
Where, oh where,
should I search for you?

870
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:49,000
Appear as my love, O Master!

871
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:19,840
All my sorrows and joys
I shall accept from you

872
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:29,440
This world of cares
I shall surrender to you

873
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,880
You are my Lord, dearest

874
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,479
You are the star of my eye

875
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:38,639
Sufis dance
with arms opened wide…

876
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,120
as they travel to Allah in their mind.

877
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,760
Now, for the refrain.

878
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,360
Come, join the song…

879
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:46,840
Come!

880
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,080
Come along…

881
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,120
You are my Lord, dearest

882
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:54,600
You are the star of my eye

883
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:59,680
You are my Lord, dearest
You are the Star of my eye

884
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:03,520
By its light let me take refuge...

885
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:09,160
in the throb of your heart till I die

886
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:21,200
Fate's decree is indelible,
overwrite it, O my Master

887
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,640
My Master, O my Master!

888
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:58,160
Give me relief, relief…

889
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:04,400
Give me relief, relief…
With passionate love fill me!

890
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:07,520
Fill me with desire abundant...

891
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,959
more abundant than the sea!

892
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:17,200
Give me relief, relief,
With passionate love fill me

893
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,360
Fill me with desire abundant...

894
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:25,440
more abundant than the sea!

895
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,520
Were it to happen so...

896
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,160
that all scenes
with your magic glow

897
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:34,240
May this world dwell
within my heart...

898
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:38,880
…where every part is you!

899
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,560
Just heard they've beaten
up a guy from the slum

900
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,720
He's in the hospital, poor bum!

901
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,120
These are their scare tactics...

902
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,880
to clear Mirrorsville slum.

903
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:28,400
And we?

904
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,640
We just sit & watch?

905
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,400
Let the Mitters wield the stick?

906
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,720
Don't worry so much Sabir

907
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,200
We Khans have our own technique!

908
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,560
Hey! Hey! Hey!

909
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,600
Moving around openly, these kids!

910
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:09,120
What if someone were to see?

911
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,840
Tayeb bhai?

912
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,160
Tabbu!

913
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:44,440
Here in this room? You...?

914
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,920
Who…who's this one?

915
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,040
Bishu Mitter's son!!!

916
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:21,280
Fate's decree... indelible...
overwrite... my Master

917
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,040
Tell you something Rawno?

918
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,880
Get out of here.

919
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,400
This business, all this fighting –
it's not for you my dear.

920
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,560
Get out of here!

921
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:39,280
Remember Uncle Bunty?
Lives in Mumbai...?

922
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,440
He's very fond of you.

923
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:44,000
Shall I ask him to try?

924
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,400
Make music your career...

925
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,120
come home sometimes to me.

926
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,320
After you make good...

927
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,240
get married...

928
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,360
to someone you love truly.

929
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:04,200
Don't listen to what
others say...

930
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,920
or you'll live to rue the day!

931
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,520
You have only one life.
Live it your own way!

932
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,320
Tell me Aunt...

933
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,400
Christians & Hindus can marry.

934
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,480
So can Hindu and Sikh.

935
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:22,120
But if it's Hindu-Muslim
the marriage won't stick?

936
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,480
What?

937
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,320
Rot!

938
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,919
Get such ideas out of your head!

939
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,200
In our faith it's forbidden.

940
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,440
It's forbidden today...

941
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,080
as it was forbidden then

942
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,640
'Then' meaning?
When?

943
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:42,160
A few years before my
marriage maybe…

944
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,200
I had a friend called Madhu...

945
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,720
from a Hindu family.

946
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:51,880
Probabaly quite a bit
younger than me.

947
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,640
Daadijaan's brother's house in Lucknow...?

948
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,440
We went there in winter you know…

949
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:02,039
This friend of mine lived next door.
Your Abbujaan…

950
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:05,800
…was crazy about her!
She too, was undone!

951
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,560
Madhu…?

952
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,080
It's an old story...

953
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,040
but look at the turn of life -

954
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,440
Madhu lives here now...

955
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,080
as Bishu Mitter's wife!

956
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:31,480
Keep it loose, see...?

957
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,600
Let go, or he'll cut free!

958
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,680
Cut him down! Yippee!

959
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,840
Will you marry me?

960
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,440
I will.

961
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,640
What about your Abbu & Ammi?

962
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,600
Tomorrow, I'll tell
my father clearly…

963
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:48,200
…you're the only
one I'll ever marry

964
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:52,320
My father cannot bear
to see his daughter in despair

965
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,320
She must always be
happy & carefree!

966
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,600
What makes her happy then?

967
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:00,840
Only when 'yours truly'
is in her ken?

968
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,080
And then?

969
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,520
Ammi!

970
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,600
Sent all my shirts
to the laundry at one go?

971
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,680
Was it essesntial to do so?

972
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,000
Not a single good one left!

973
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,400
What am I to wear?

974
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,320
Go find me something,

975
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,560
I'm going out in half an hour!

976
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,040
So you needed her right now?

977
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:30,080
I see!

978
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:32,680
How nicely she was oiling my hair!

979
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,400
You ruined it with your yelling, you bear!

980
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,200
You're the only one to go out?
Not me?

981
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:43,040
So? I'll take over
the oiling now…

982
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:51,320
Stop it! What d'you know of
oil massages anyhow!

983
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:55,960
Really?
So who does?

984
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,200
Rawno, your lover boy?

985
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,280
Who-who's Rawno?

986
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,240
Wh-who's Rawno?

987
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,360
Stop acting coy!

988
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:14,120
I know what you're up to,
each & every ploy!

989
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:19,720
What you do, where you meet...
I know everything!

990
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:25,800
Bunking college
& having a great fling!

991
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:32,000
What are you thinking?
When you'll meet & tell?

992
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:38,760
Keep one thing in mind –
he's a Hindu! Infidel!

993
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:43,840
More important than that –
he's a Mitter!

994
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:49,560
They're our sworn enemies!
It would be a slur…

995
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:54,360
But no way will I
marry that Parvez!

996
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,200
I would rather die!
I'm telling you straight.

997
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:00,960
Really?

998
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:08,320
So whose wife will you be,
my pretty one?

999
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:14,360
No one's at all. She'll live alone,
will Zuleika Khan.

1000
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,880
That's for the best.

1001
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,760
Remain alone... here in this house…

1002
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,680
right here untill you die

1003
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,760
I'll look after you always…

1004
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,520
Stay here, under my eye.

1005
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,920
Your dad and my mom?

1006
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,880
It's got to be a joke!

1007
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,040
Your mom and my aunt
were friends!

1008
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,000
That's how it broke!

1009
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,480
And then?

1010
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:56,200
They dreamed many dreams,
the two of them!

1011
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:00,680
The families may have met
to talk things over…

1012
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,640
Must have gone pretty far!

1013
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:08,040
If the girl embraces Islam,
I have no problem.

1014
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,160
But can she?

1015
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:18,200
It would still be a
problem for me!

1016
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,640
A girl who can forswear
her own religious vows…

1017
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:24,719
how can she be true to
her love & her spouse?

1018
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:28,920
I tell you straight,
if a kafir enters here…

1019
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:35,240
She won't, never fear!

1020
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,120
I'd much rather get out of here!

1021
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:49,720
If they wish me to convert, I shall

1022
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:57,080
Why just religion, for you I'll give up all

1023
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,760
But…

1024
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,520
But…what?

1025
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:05,120
I'm thinking of my father.
Such a strict Hindu!

1026
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,080
He'll be devastated if I eschew…

1027
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,840
I don't want that either, Madhu…

1028
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,760
What're you trying to say?

1029
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,760
We'll have to elope somewhere -
far, far away!

1030
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,200
But where?

1031
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:27,960
Mumbai. My Uncle Bunty
has lived there for years

1032
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:33,840
We'll live with them at first
till I start my career

1033
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:38,880
I'll be a famous playback singer
in no time you'll see!

1034
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:44,000
It won't always be like this,
on top of the world we'll be!

1035
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:54,680
So?

1036
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,680
Will you elope with me, Khan?

1037
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:12,080
I will Rawno,
You are my jaan (life)

1038
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:20,480
You will do no such thing!
If you still do...

1039
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:32,480
I swear on your dead mother,
I'll hound out you two!

1040
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,400
And with my own hands,
I'll kill you.

1041
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,760
He won't escape either…

1042
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,800
And after I've killed you both,
I'll kill myself too.

1043
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,960
Father!

1044
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,480
Listen Khan...

1045
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,240
suppose we stay as
paying guests somewhere?

1046
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:01,640
Or may be... at a cramped shanty
somewhere?

1047
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:05,920
As long as we're together,
I really don't care.

1048
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,280
But wait!

1049
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,840
Will you find work in Mumbai?

1050
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,720
You're not a graduate yet!

1051
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,800
Hang graduation!
Remember that Club night?

1052
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:22,520
Rawna's magic?
How that one song took flight?

1053
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:27,120
If nothing else,
I'll join a band.

1054
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,200
They do well there, I believe

1055
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,360
I could get Montey over, and…

1056
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,879
…he'd be lyricist, lead singer – me,

1057
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:41,400
Chiku with his drums…that's three…

1058
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,240
Great!
What about me?

1059
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:46,120
I'd be out?
All of you in?

1060
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,120
Why out?

1061
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:50,080
You too will sing!

1062
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,240
No worries, mate!

1063
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,360
Fusion is in!

1064
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:55,320
Hmm.
Where will we live there?

1065
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Imagine…

1066
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,520
a little room somewhere…

1067
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,840
Hmm…

1068
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,120
…a little room I see…

1069
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,880
So-so-do-re-mi-mi

1070
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:34,320
Cheaply, but together, we'd
make it quite pretty

1071
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:39,840
We can live in a low-rent room,
a cramped little shanty

1072
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:43,519
Take showers in time-bound water,
perfectly dandy!

1073
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,879
Together though!

1074
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:51,440
Now we wake up early…

1075
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,599
…share eggs & toast quite fairly

1076
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:59,520
There we wake up early,
share eggs & toast quite fairly

1077
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:04,520
Go & watch Sharukh Khan
at a morning show

1078
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,199
Don't giggle!
Wait and see…

1079
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:12,040
We'll turn Mumbai into
Switzerland, with ease!

1080
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,160
A little room I see…

1081
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,880
So so do re mi mi!

1082
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:19,160
We'll make it so pretty!

1083
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:23,760
I can cook a little,
will you say 'third rate'?

1084
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,880
If lunch consists of noodles,

1085
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:30,400
and dinner is omelette?
- Super!

1086
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:33,999
My mouth is watering already!

1087
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:39,720
For power cuts at dinner
we'll have candles ready

1088
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,960
The Arabian Sea

1089
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:47,359
is calling me…

1090
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,400
Let's start packing now!

1091
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:55,200
The two of us will hit it off
somewhere, somehow…

1092
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:57,240
We'll cut down on costs…

1093
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,039
But our mood will be regal!

1094
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:04,560
We'll shop in the evening
after a full-day's rehearsal

1095
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:12,319
Two hearts... overflowing...

1096
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:15,240
in a cramped little shanty…

1097
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:18,240
Oh no!
Not a shanty any more!

1098
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,319
A little room I see…

1099
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,240
So so do re mi mi

1100
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,840
We'll make it so pretty

1101
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:27,960
We'll play it musically

1102
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,640
A little room I see…

1103
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,840
A little room I see…

1104
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,760
So so do re mi! mi

1105
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:39,760
It'll be oh so pretty!

1106
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:50,480
A little room I see…

1107
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:55,920
It'll be oh so pretty!

1108
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,480
I'd dosed off!

1109
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,520
And I was dreaming…

1110
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:18,600
…that my Reshmabai International
Puppet Theatre...

1111
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,279
had become very famous

1112
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,080
We were getting calls
from all over!

1113
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,440
And along with that...

1114
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,000
money!

1115
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:32,160
But all these are
just daydreams!

1116
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:34,440
Dreams...

1117
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:39,680
How sweet they are, these dreams...

1118
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:40,920
aren't they?

1119
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:47,120
But dreams are all they are…

1120
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:53,120
Reality is playing
complex games elsewhere!

1121
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,640
Come, let's take a look!

1122
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,880
It's a game of percentage, bro...

1123
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,400
a game of percentage!

1124
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,120
It's played the world over...

1125
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,520
played from age to age

1126
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:14,920
It's all being done for betterment...

1127
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,520
from housing to mall

1128
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:21,960
What're you ready to pay?

1129
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,560
Everyone's ready to sell!

1130
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:30,959
All the moral outrage...

1131
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,680
goes right to hell!

1132
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:38,519
At the hint of a cut, they whisper...

1133
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:41,720
what's my percentage?

1134
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:53,280
Elections are ahead

1135
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:56,560
The party has an image

1136
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,520
Social activists...

1137
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,240
are hovering off-stage!

1138
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,560
Once they come on stage...

1139
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,400
they will tell a different tale!

1140
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,600
Each will have a placard...

1141
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,760
saying I AM UP FOR SALE!

1142
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,760
The world is up for sale, bro...

1143
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,040
the world is up for sale!

1144
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:16,120
Let Arshi Tower or Arshi Mall...

1145
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,599
come up when they will

1146
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:21,520
Slum dwellers are expendable!

1147
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,600
They can go to hell!

1148
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,360
Let them go to hell, saala...

1149
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:29,320
let them go to hell!

1150
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,680
You know all the rules here

1151
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,280
Money's the leverage

1152
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:36,040
So why all this hide & seek?

1153
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:36,960
What's the cut you'll take?

1154
01:32:36,961 --> 01:32:39,720
Name your percentage!

1155
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,920
Here, take a sip.

1156
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,240
90 per cup

1157
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:02,000
How much do you charge?

1158
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,080
2 rupees

1159
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,480
2 rupees?

1160
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,440
Is your quality inferior?

1161
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,960
From far and wide people come here!

1162
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,639
Your pancakes and jalebis
are so hot!

1163
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:20,360
Yet tea's only 2 rupees?
Surely not!

1164
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:27,160
That chai will sell for
25 rupees or more...

1165
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:29,760
once you set up at a Mall Store.

1166
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,920
Ethnic food! Ethnic look!

1167
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,560
Manik's Tea Shop!

1168
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,480
You'll be right on top!

1169
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:37,760
Yes or no?

1170
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:41,840
Think it over, there's no hurry

1171
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,320
Here, keep my card.

1172
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:49,480
Just a phone call, no need to worry.

1173
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:55,960
The school teacher said
Raju is the best

1174
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:01,280
Be it annual exams
or a class test

1175
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:06,800
But what can we do
to help him get ahead?

1176
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:11,720
He helps you with your
tea-shop instead!

1177
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:14,200
Just stop to consider…

1178
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:18,560
…how much money we'll get
if we accept their offer!

1179
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,960
You can afford an assistant...

1180
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,480
Raju can go to an
English medium school!

1181
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,880
Surely you can do this for your son!

1182
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:38,480
Ruin his life? Don't be a fool!

1183
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:45,840
What is there to think
about so much?

1184
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,240
I'm not the only one!

1185
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,920
Have to consider the others too!

1186
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,880
When have the others
thought of you?

1187
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,600
If they got such an offer...

1188
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:59,760
wouldn't they grab it too?

1189
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,600
Feel like studying
in an English medium school?

1190
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:25,120
Hey kafir!
Arshinagar is going!

1191
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:27,600
What d'you plan on doing?

1192
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:29,040
Nothing...

1193
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:30,800
If Arshinagar goes...

1194
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,720
your temple's no use!

1195
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:35,319
No more ringing of that bell!

1196
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:37,400
Who says so, tell?

1197
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:38,680
Good Lord!!

1198
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:39,960
What's in your head?

1199
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,839
Cowdung or grass?

1200
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:44,880
The slum will be razed
to build highrises!

1201
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:46,400
Everyone is moving out

1202
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,800
Want to live?
Better move your ass!

1203
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:51,960
Let them move…
- What're you out to prove?

1204
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:54,720
Found some other temple?

1205
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:57,199
The Minister is coming
Ask him, take a gamble!

1206
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,800
No time like now –
pre-election rumble!

1207
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:03,680
'Luck by Chance' (Bollywood film),
there!

1208
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,680
No need to ask.
The temple's not going anywhere!

1209
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:08,640
Just hear him!

1210
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:10,400
Is he dreaming by day?

1211
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,520
Wait! Wait!

1212
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:12,919
Temple not moving?
How pray?

1213
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,520
They've settled my way.

1214
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:15,800
Settled?

1215
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:19,520
Who's they?

1216
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,920
Murli…or what's his name?

1217
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:24,560
Came here yesterday.

1218
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:27,879
He said, when the new housing
comes up here…

1219
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:30,600
…they'll build a new temple
in the centre.

1220
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:34,959
All very fancy, with a brand new altar.

1221
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:38,760
I'll remain the priest.
We'll soon seal the matter.

1222
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:40,440
Now let's see…

1223
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,200
Blessings shower on you…
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

1224
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:43,840
Who the hell are you?

1225
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,719
Murli…from the Mitter company?

1226
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:48,120
But if there's a temple,
why not a masjid too?

1227
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:50,559
Don't overdo the Hindu act
& be too canny!

1228
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:51,800
Right! Well said!

1229
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:54,080
Masjid plus temple they must pledge!

1230
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:55,040
Why?

1231
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,960
Take a count right now!

1232
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:58,680
Who's in the majority?

1233
01:36:58,720 --> 01:36:59,960
Don't we all know!

1234
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,440
Want to build a masjid?
Go to Pakistan!

1235
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:09,040
Here Hindus are majority,
got it woman?

1236
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:12,560
You guys each have four wives!
Never-ending itch!

1237
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,760
No plans to leave here,
no plans to switch!

1238
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:17,760
Why should we leave, you dog?

1239
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:19,096
Does India belong to your father!

1240
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:20,000
Hey Mangal!

1241
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:22,880
Just out of hospital!
Take it no further!

1242
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:26,240
Another word, I'll break your leg
& leave you as you were!

1243
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,360
What's going on?

1244
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:15,319
Everyone stop!
Hands down! Hands down!

1245
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:18,440
Minister-ji is here...
you're behaving like this?

1246
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:21,839
We look after this slum here,
we know what it is

1247
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:25,600
Yes, a little water shortage,
Yes, a little amiss…

1248
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,960
See that Satyasharan?

1249
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:31,240
Men can be such morons!

1250
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,680
Someone says something...

1251
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,759
bang! It starts a riot!

1252
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:38,000
The CM's view is quite correct

1253
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:40,080
Annhilate…compensate...

1254
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:41,680
and you'll clear the ambit!

1255
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:42,680
Whose annihilation?

1256
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,600
What compensation?

1257
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:47,480
Will the market decide?

1258
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,960
Can their loss be recompensed?

1259
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:51,960
Their hunger satisfied?

1260
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,400
Calm down, brothers!

1261
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:00,120
Give it a break.

1262
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:02,520
Calm down, calm down!

1263
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,960
Peace, for god's sake!

1264
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:08,480
Peace, Peace, Peace...

1265
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:26,840
Om, may there be peace in heaven

1266
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:31,160
May there be peace in the sky

1267
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:34,519
…in water

1268
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:38,280
…in the plants

1269
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:42,240
…in the trees

1270
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:48,520
…to the Gods in their
various worlds

1271
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:51,600
…in Brahman

1272
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:55,280
May there be peace in all

1273
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:59,359
May there be peace indeed
within peace…

1274
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:03,360
…giving me the peace,
which grows within me

1275
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:06,720
Om...

1276
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:17,640
What's this Biloo?

1277
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,800
What happened? Where?

1278
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,080
How did you get here?

1279
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:27,040
It was the Khan gang...
Tayeb & his men.

1280
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,760
Threw a pile of bricks on him!

1281
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,000
Could've died right then!

1282
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:36,440
And Tayeb, that b... tard!

1283
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,839
I'll teach him such a lesson,
bloody coward!

1284
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,720
It was an accident, Montey…

1285
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:42,440
Tayeb is hurt too…

1286
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:44,560
Hurt? Rubbish!

1287
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,320
Just a scratch or two!

1288
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:50,320
And now, to Ratanpur
he plans to go...

1289
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,440
by car, on dirt roads,
sixty miles or so!

1290
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,000
What can I do?

1291
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:57,880
What can I do?

1292
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,000
Vora, that scoundrel…

1293
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:02,600
…has sold the same plot
to them as well!

1294
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:03,960
Now if we dawdle...

1295
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:06,440
Tayeb will win the land battle!

1296
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,880
He'll reach Ratanpur by sunrise.

1297
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:11,000
Uncle's away. Letting the land go…

1298
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:12,880
tell me, is it wise?

1299
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:15,360
Well then, I'm coming too.

1300
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:17,520
Think Tayeb's a fool?

1301
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:20,600
If he get's a chance, he'll finish you!
Stubborn mule!

1302
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:22,840
If Tayeb is hot-headed...

1303
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:25,200
you're a stove that's overheated!

1304
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,680
Can anyone control you but me?

1305
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,040
That's it then, I'm also in the team.

1306
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:33,000
Why're you making a fuss?

1307
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:36,880
You think you're helping?

1308
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:42,240
You'll just make it worse!

1309
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:16,600
Aha! Who have we here?

1310
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:20,400
Mr. Lover boy! I see!

1311
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:25,480
Given up romancing for work?
Oh gee!

1312
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,760
Great! What a thrill!

1313
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:35,960
Waited a long time…
Now I'll punch my fill!

1314
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:38,720
Tayeb, please!

1315
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:41,640
I'm not here to fight you…

1316
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:43,400
Really?

1317
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:45,720
Is that true?

1318
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:47,960
So that's your game here?

1319
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:51,600
From playboy to pukka saint...

1320
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:54,960
how does that square?

1321
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:57,640
How long can you keep it up?

1322
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:01,240
There!

1323
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:03,760
There!

1324
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:06,360
There!

1325
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:09,840
There!

1326
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:52,960
Rawna saala!
What're you doing?

1327
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,040
Go on, give it back!

1328
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:57,280
Cool it Tayeb!
Enough of the attack!

1329
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:01,360
Hey Tayeb!

1330
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,160
Lay off!

1331
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:07,480
Rawna's not part of this face-off!

1332
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,600
But of course!

1333
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,160
But of course!

1334
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:16,840
Except, from the best of our clan…

1335
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:26,200
…he lures away girls when he can!

1336
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,840
Here, Mitter's son...

1337
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:36,400
come & face the action!

1338
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,160
Lay a hand, I'll chop it off…

1339
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:47,120
You hear?

1340
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:49,880
You hear?

1341
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:52,800
Make sure you listen!

1342
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,440
Move Rawna,
I'll settle his hash…

1343
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:57,760
No!

1344
01:44:58,160 --> 01:44:59,440
No, Montey! No!
Don't be rash!

1345
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:00,800
No, Rawna! I'll have to thrash...

1346
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:36,160
Peace, Peace, Peace...

1347
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:38,600
What is it Montey?

1348
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:40,920
Are you badly hurt?

1349
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:43,480
Hey man, are you cut?

1350
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:46,040
Oh it's nothing…

1351
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:49,000
a scratch, just a scratch…

1352
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:38,800
I'll take you to the hospital at once...

1353
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:44,160
Courage man, the hurt cannot be much!

1354
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:47,040
Too late Rawna!

1355
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:55,600
Didn't listen, got me in a mess?

1356
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:57,880
Saala...

1357
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,480
Mitters & Khans!

1358
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:08,440
A plague on both your houses!

1359
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:12,120
With just one scratch...

1360
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:17,400
Montey rests his case

1361
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:21,760
Montey?

1362
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:24,800
Montey?

1363
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:40,200
Hey!

1364
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:44,840
No one interfere!

1365
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:51,560
This is between him and me!

1366
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:55,400
Come, Rawna, come!

1367
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:58,800
Who's tougher?

1368
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:00,680
You or me?

1369
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:04,040
Peace, Peace, Peace...

1370
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:07,560
Peace, Peace, Peace...

1371
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:22,400
Om, may there be peace in heaven

1372
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:26,720
May there be peace in the sky

1373
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:30,800
…in water

1374
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:34,600
…in the plants

1375
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:38,560
…in the trees

1376
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:44,840
…in the Gods in their
various worlds

1377
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:47,880
…in Brahman

1378
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:51,600
May there be peace in all

1379
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:56,840
May there be peace indeed
within peace…

1380
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:00,880
…giving me the peace,
which grows within me

1381
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:08,000
Om, Peace, Peace, Peace…

1382
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:45,280
Here she is!

1383
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:47,200
Here she is, the witch!

1384
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:51,760
Carrying on with her cousin's slayer!

1385
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:53,999
Not an ounce of shame, the bitch!

1386
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,600
Ask her!

1387
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:57,479
Go on, ask her!

1388
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,760
Is all this true, Zulekha?

1389
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:01,680
Not true?

1390
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:04,520
Her diary's filled with that
murderer's name right through!

1391
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:09,640
Not once, but again and again!

1392
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:13,600
With photographs too, for shame!

1393
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:15,120
Najma...

1394
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:22,000
Parvez is going back
to Dubai in ten days.

1395
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:26,680
Arrange a small dinner
this week please.

1396
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:31,560
Julie will be wedded
to Parvez for life

1397
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:34,080
He'll take her back with him
as his wife

1398
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:35,400
Abbu!

1399
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,600
Please…no!

1400
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:40,960
Julie, no arguments any more!

1401
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:44,600
Marrying a Hindu?
Where is the question?

1402
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:45,920
Impossible!

1403
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:51,720
Even if he's ready
to change his religion.

1404
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:55,600
Don't forget he's killed
a kinsman of yours!

1405
01:53:55,640 --> 01:54:00,360
He'll be rotting in jail
for the rest of his years.

1406
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:04,280
Time for prayers now...

1407
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:07,520
we'll discuss all this later.

1408
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:15,200
Grandma...

1409
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:18,360
today we will pray with you

1410
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:20,880
In this room, right here.

1411
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:23,840
Najma…

1412
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:28,440
Abbu…

1413
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:31,960
I have a singing class now…

1414
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,400
Salim sa'ab is waiting.

1415
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:36,120
Please may I go…?

1416
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:41,519
Step out of this house?
Don't even try!

1417
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:46,080
You'll marry in 10 days,
& go straight to Dubai.

1418
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:50,120
Uncle is taking
the next flight from Delhi

1419
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:54,120
After that...? Let's see

1420
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,360
Not true!

1421
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:01,120
It's not true!

1422
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:05,320
My son's not a killer, I know

1423
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:07,840
This eye for an eye business...

1424
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:10,280
has gone on too long!

1425
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:11,480
Rawna...

1426
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:16,280
this blind hatred has to stop!

1427
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:23,520
Sunny said there was many a witness...

1428
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:29,240
who'll testify you killed
in self-defence?

1429
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:32,800
Stay in hiding for some time...

1430
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:36,040
where no one can find you.

1431
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:40,680
Know of any place you could go to?

1432
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:43,440
Wh-what did you say?

1433
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,000
Know of a safe place...

1434
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,640
where you can stay?

1435
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:50,880
I don't know…

1436
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:54,520
maybe…Mumbai…

1437
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:57,640
I have an uncle there…

1438
01:56:57,680 --> 01:56:59,840
maybe I could try…

1439
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:04,440
But…but Julie…?

1440
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:07,520
Julie will go with you

1441
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:10,080
I give you my word!

1442
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:20,520
I know right now you're
feeling beleaguered.

1443
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:24,800
Fati will take you to
Khan House tonight.

1444
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:27,120
But remember...

1445
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:29,600
you must come back by first light!

1446
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:32,160
Sunny will then whisk you off.

1447
01:57:32,240 --> 01:57:33,880
To a bungalow…

1448
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:36,240
…deep inside the forest.

1449
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:39,640
I will let you know…

1450
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:41,800
where and when
Julie will meet you.

1451
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:43,680
I'll tell you too…

1452
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:47,280
…which route to take for Bombay.

1453
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:48,360
Okay?

1454
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:54,400
What's up?

1455
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:56,080
Stopping me of all people?

1456
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:57,880
New here, you pup?

1457
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,120
Who's that with you?

1458
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:01,920
Don't know her?

1459
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,600
She's your Granny!

1460
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:05,920
The Queen of Tuscany!

1461
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,799
For God's sake, it's
'Tall Marrium, ' the masseuse!

1462
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:11,520
She also cleans
fingernails and toes

1463
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:15,800
Hey Marriam! Hold open
your box under his nose!

1464
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:24,640
I don't believe it!

1465
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:27,080
I won't believe it! No!

1466
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:33,200
Tell me, did you really kill
Tabbu bhaai?

1467
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:36,120
No! No!

1468
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:38,720
Say no more!

1469
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:46,480
I won't believe it
even if you swore!

1470
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:14,280
Julie bibi!

1471
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:18,400
Julie, my pet...

1472
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:28,040
Go back to sleep Rawno.
It's not morning yet

1473
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:34,800
Julie!

1474
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,040
Julie bibi, listen!

1475
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:42,320
Julie!

1476
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:45,960
Hurry! Hurry!

1477
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:47,560
Ask him to come out!

1478
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:50,800
Sunny's waiting at Salim Sa'ab's house...

1479
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:03,000
Bye Rawno

1480
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:06,880
In two days we meet again…

1481
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:09,840
& off to Mumbai we go!

1482
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:13,920
I can barely wait till then!

1483
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,120
Don't pack too much, Khan!

1484
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:24,080
Where's the space…?

1485
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:29,160
I know, I know, my 'jaan'!

1486
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:37,560
I'll take very little.

1487
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:39,840
My song book here…

1488
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:42,080
And…
- My guitar!

1489
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:44,800
Plus some money!

1490
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:47,240
We'll need that too, you know!

1491
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:50,640
I have some savings here.

1492
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:52,680
I'll bring it along for sure…

1493
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:04,200
Okay Khan, bye!

1494
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:11,280
It won't be long now!

1495
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:18,640
Wait! Don't go! Listen!

1496
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:24,000
What made me think...

1497
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:26,720
I'll never see you again?

1498
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:28,520
No, no!

1499
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:32,640
Mustn't call you back… Go now!

1500
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:41,040
Don't end up marrying
that Parvez somehow!

1501
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:42,520
Ya Allah!

1502
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:44,840
I would rather die!

1503
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:46,040
Shh!

1504
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:51,720
Never say that again!

1505
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,720
For now, goodbye…

1506
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:59,080
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
There isn't any time!

1507
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:05,200
Bye Rawno…

1508
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:08,040
I love you, my 'jaan'

1509
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:17,920
Love you too, Khan

1510
02:02:25,680 --> 02:02:28,200
After this, the game took a turn...

1511
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:33,480
that no one could have imagined
in their wildest dreams!

1512
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,960
Trumped by the Ace!

1513
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:41,600
Ya Allah!

1514
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:43,840
Water! Water!

1515
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:27,520
Wait, wait, Commissioner Sir.

1516
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:30,400
Keep aside your law books,
take a breather!

1517
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:35,280
Religious sentiments hurt!

1518
02:03:35,320 --> 02:03:36,720
That's not a joke!

1519
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:40,400
In such cases,
anger provokes folk.

1520
02:03:41,680 --> 02:03:44,240
Forces? No, no, not yet.

1521
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:47,080
Give it another 24 hours to abate…

1522
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:49,400
Don't send your forces until I call.

1523
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:52,720
Well, will that be all?

1524
02:03:55,080 --> 02:04:00,120
All you say is 'I' & 'Me'!

1525
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:04,400
Who is this 'I', tell me?

1526
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:09,480
Tell me, who is 'Me'?

1527
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:15,000
The One deep within,
you never cared to see

1528
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:19,960
The 'I' deep within,
you forgot to see...

1529
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:26,600
All you say is 'Me!'

1530
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:31,960
Who is this 'Me?'

1531
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:36,760
Tell me, who is He?

1532
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:41,400
The One deep within,
you don't care to see

1533
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:46,080
The One deep within,
you forgot to see

1534
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:54,520
Now down to business!

1535
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:56,080
There is no time to waste

1536
02:04:56,120 --> 02:04:58,279
Come at dawn tomorrow...

1537
02:04:58,280 --> 02:05:00,840
to Urmapur crossing straight...

1538
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:03,720
By 5? Don't be late!

1539
02:05:04,240 --> 02:05:07,279
Fatima & Zulekha
will start out late tonight

1540
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:10,760
Pappu will take them
there by first light

1541
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:13,280
From there,
the highway is quite near

1542
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:16,560
A truck will be
waiting for you there

1543
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:21,080
You have to get going by six at any rate!

1544
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:24,280
Don't worry...

1545
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:26,160
all instructions have been given

1546
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:27,800
They'll take you to Mumbai straight.

1547
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:31,480
I'm no sadhu...

1548
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:37,520
no guru, nor mentor

1549
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:46,520
No Haji

1550
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:51,280
No Maulvi

1551
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:57,280
No hermit either

1552
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:04,000
Neither man, nor woman

1553
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:10,320
Temple, mosque, or pilgrimage
none of these can…

1554
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:13,840
…draw 'Me'

1555
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:18,760
No, none of these can draw 'Me'

1556
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:20,959
The 'I' deep within,
you never cared to see

1557
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:22,520
Begum Saheba!

1558
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:26,160
Save us, Begum Saheba!

1559
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:29,800
Riots everywhere!
Please give us shelter!

1560
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:33,240
Where else can I go
with this grandchild of mine?

1561
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:34,560
Ya Allah!

1562
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:37,400
What need for this killing & arson?

1563
02:06:37,480 --> 02:06:39,160
They've all gone insane...

1564
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:40,919
killing each other at sight!

1565
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:42,600
Those we've known all our lives...

1566
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:44,920
have turned strangers overnight!

1567
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:51,320
Very well, until things calm down,
you may stay

1568
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:54,840
Go, close the door - right away!

1569
02:06:58,400 --> 02:06:59,600
Zulekha!

1570
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:01,440
Look at me!

1571
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:08,080
Do you love that
murderous kafir, truly?

1572
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:13,480
The One deep within,
you never cared to see

1573
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:18,320
The 'I' deep within,
you forgot to see...

1574
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:32,200
Well then, go to him...
your cursed infidel!

1575
02:07:32,360 --> 02:07:35,680
Fatema will take you to him
as soon as she is able

1576
02:07:36,200 --> 02:07:39,280
But there's no returning home

1577
02:07:39,560 --> 02:07:42,480
This is your last night, clear?

1578
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:44,800
Fati, bring a dupatta (scarf) here!

1579
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:50,640
A very dangerous thing, this love!

1580
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:53,520
Your Abbu suffered silently...

1581
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:56,920
all his life, poor dove!

1582
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:01,000
You, at least,
mustn't let your life…

1583
02:08:02,840 --> 02:08:03,920
Fati?

1584
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:08,240
Didn't she wear a moustache
on the day of that party?

1585
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:14,480
No ties have I...

1586
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:21,960
with where I abide

1587
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:32,160
My link with the body...

1588
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:36,360
how do I describe?

1589
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:42,760
It's like the birds upon the tree...

1590
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:48,200
Yes, it's like the birds...

1591
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:52,520
upon the tree

1592
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:57,160
They sit there, yet are free

1593
02:08:57,440 --> 02:09:01,080
Like the birds, I'm always free

1594
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:05,879
The One deep within,
you never cared to see

1595
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:08,920
The 'I' deep within,
you forgot to see

1596
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:11,640
Look Parvez...

1597
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:14,920
let's keep it
low key at present.

1598
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:18,040
When you two come back again...

1599
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:19,440
we'll have a huge banquet

1600
02:09:19,480 --> 02:09:20,720
We'll call everyone then

1601
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:22,080
What news of Julie's visa?

1602
02:09:22,120 --> 02:09:24,200
We'll get it tomorrow I hear.

1603
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:26,360
Great! So all is good.

1604
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,120
One minute…

1605
02:09:32,120 --> 02:09:33,960
Yes, Deendayal-ji?

1606
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:38,560
What!

1607
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:43,240
The other side of the crossing?

1608
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:45,600
What's the Commissioner doing?

1609
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:48,400
Not sending forces? Why?

1610
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:54,080
Religious sentiment!

1611
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:56,360
I know Deendayal's style!

1612
02:09:56,600 --> 02:09:58,720
Okay, thank you Deendayal-ji…

1613
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:01,280
God be with you then.

1614
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:05,120
Now, all will go according to plan!

1615
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:07,080
The riot is on!

1616
02:10:07,160 --> 02:10:08,999
Fire all about!

1617
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,840
By the time it dies down...

1618
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:13,200
the slum will be wiped out!

1619
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:15,839
Let the flames rise higher…

1620
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:18,160
douse the ashes, not the fire!

1621
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:21,960
From the ruins of Arshi slum,
let Arshi Mall appear!

1622
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:24,360
So be it

1623
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:32,600
A Sorcerer has set up
His stage devices

1624
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:41,080
In His workshop
we don various guises

1625
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:47,280
When we drop them
at the end of the show...

1626
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:50,880
where do we go, tell me?

1627
02:10:51,640 --> 02:10:55,320
O, where do we go, tell me?

1628
02:10:55,480 --> 02:10:59,680
The One deep within,
you never cared to see

1629
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:04,520
The 'I' deep within,
you forgot to see

1630
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:08,120
Wait!

1631
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:14,120
That's a Hindu, wait!

1632
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:17,520
Where are you off to, so late?

1633
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:19,000
Who's in the back seat?

1634
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:20,440
- This lady's very sick.

1635
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:22,360
That one is her son.

1636
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:24,640
I know it's risky...

1637
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:26,320
but I couldn't let them down.

1638
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:27,480
Won't take much longer

1639
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:29,776
Just beyond the level crossing
there's a doctor's chamber.

1640
02:11:29,800 --> 02:11:33,280
Okay, drive on then
Better be careful though!

1641
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:36,520
They're waiting at every crossing
letting no one go!

1642
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:44,040
It's always Me…Me…

1643
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:57,720
All you say is 'I' & 'Me!'

1644
02:11:58,720 --> 02:12:02,040
Who is this 'I', tell me?

1645
02:12:02,120 --> 02:12:05,720
Tell me, who is 'Me'?

1646
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:08,480
Mission accomplished, Mr Mitter!

1647
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:12,240
Arshi Tower can now be built.
What could be better?

1648
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:15,840
All according to plan?

1649
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:17,560
A perfect job done!

1650
02:12:17,640 --> 02:12:19,680
By the time the police arrive...

1651
02:12:19,720 --> 02:12:21,760
nothing but ashes will remain!

1652
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:25,600
Who is this 'I', tell me?

1653
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:30,080
The One deep within,
you never cared to see

1654
02:12:30,600 --> 02:12:35,600
The 'I' deep within,
you forgot to see...

1655
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:06,800
Fati, you'd better go!

1656
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:10,000
If anyone sees us,
they'll finish us, you know!

1657
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:12,560
Don't worry, I'll be fine

1658
02:13:12,720 --> 02:13:15,040
Rawno will soon be here

1659
02:13:15,080 --> 02:13:18,400
I'll call you dear,
once we're settled there.

1660
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:21,080
So, I'll go now, shall I?

1661
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:28,120
Take care, my Fati…

1662
02:13:30,680 --> 02:13:32,840
God be with you…Bye!

1663
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:36,400
What's the hurry, Julie?

1664
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:39,120
There is time still…

1665
02:13:39,440 --> 02:13:42,480
I've stayed with you
for so many years…

1666
02:13:42,520 --> 02:13:44,800
a few more minutes can't kill?

1667
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:46,760
Hurry!

1668
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:48,440
Any minute now,
the 5:15 will be coming

1669
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:51,400
Once the gate comes down,
you'll have trouble crossing

1670
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:56,360
Yes, Biloo, bro?

1671
02:13:56,440 --> 02:13:57,840
All ok

1672
02:13:57,880 --> 02:14:00,080
At the level crossing

1673
02:14:00,520 --> 02:14:02,120
Rawna should be here soon

1674
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:03,880
Don't you be worrying!

1675
02:14:29,960 --> 02:14:31,800
Julie will be here any moment.

1676
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:34,200
Nearly 5! Don't delay!

1677
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:39,040
Go find her quickly
& bring her right away.

1678
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:23,560
Allah hoo Akbar!

1679
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:26,680
Saala! Kafir!

1680
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:28,440
You people set our homes on fire!

1681
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:30,400
We'll finish you one by one!

1682
02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:32,280
Allah hoo Akbar!

1683
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:12,880
Khan?

1684
02:17:42,320 --> 02:17:43,480
So...

1685
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:46,520
this is it, then?

1686
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:50,080
Khan...?

1687
02:17:50,440 --> 02:17:51,920
Har Har Mahadev!

1688
02:19:34,360 --> 02:19:35,920
Listen –

1689
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:43,560
Give this to her then…

1690
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:19,360
What is this now?

1691
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:24,400
Where did it come from?
