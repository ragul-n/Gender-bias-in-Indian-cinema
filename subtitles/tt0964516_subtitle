1
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:06,079
"Letme go home, beloved.
Let me go home. "

2
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:20,430
"Let me go home, beloved.
Let me go home. "

3
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,678
Dreams are sold differently
in different cities.

4
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,145
Because the city and it's monotonous
life needs the vision and color..

5
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,151
..of a beautiful dream to make itself big.

6
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,148
A city like this, where a dream of..

7
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:20,556
..becoming an international super model..

8
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,560
I, Meghna Mathur dreamt and lived.

9
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,155
The only difference was that
my dream was bigger than the city.

10
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,835
Since you were tired of eating
the potato pancakes for breakfast..

11
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,163
..so I made radish pancakes today.

12
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,765
Mother, this has a lot of butter.
- Have it.

13
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,167
I told you I am on a diet.

14
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,505
Having one won't make a difference.

15
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,514
Of course, it will.
I am trying to lose two kilos.

16
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,513
I got my portfolio done.

17
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:54,588
I was thinking of leaving
for Mumbai on Monday.

18
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,865
Monday reminds me, I have
spoken to Mehra Associates.

19
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,201
They have agreed on an
internship with them..

20
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,465
..while you finish your chartered
accountants course.

21
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:07,870
In fact, you can start with
them from Monday.

22
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,737
Papa, you didn't hear me.

23
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,411
I want to go to Mumbai..

24
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,538
to become a model.

25
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,209
I don't want to do an internship.

26
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:25,415
Meghna, I've told you earlier also.

27
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,284
Never mind.

28
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,825
Listen, dreaming isn't bad but..

29
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:32,956
But what father?

30
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,501
Fulfill only your dreams?

31
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,565
Can't I have my own dream?

32
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,835
I have decided..

33
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,439
I am going to Mumbai.

34
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:52,308
In that case there is
nothing left to discuss.

35
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,446
Do as you wish..

36
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,845
..but don't expect anything from me.

37
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,447
A little encouragement perhaps..

38
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,253
Encouragement for what?

39
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:08,995
You have lost your mind after
winning a small beauty pageant.

40
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,935
It was my fault.

41
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,277
Wants to be a model!

42
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,291
Thoug h I have spoken to
your uncle Baldev..

43
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,624
..call me as soon as you reach.

44
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,697
Father..

45
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:50,366
Don't worry.
Everything will be alright

46
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:52,836
Love you..

47
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,583
You were much younger during
cousin Kuldeep's wedding.

48
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:04,047
Divya is very happy ever since
she learnt you were coming.

49
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,381
Sister..

50
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,392
Mother was mentioning
that you want to model.

51
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:12,328
Itwill be great to watch
her on television.

52
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,456
Divya..

53
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,801
Come Meghna, I will show
you to your room.

54
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,338
Of course and be comfortable.

55
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,464
Thank you.

56
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,333
This is Divya's room..

57
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,869
You will have to share it with her.

58
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,005
Sure.

59
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,406
It's a little small..

60
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,349
..but you won't be here for long.

61
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,411
Maybe a month, until I get work.

62
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:40,016
Alright, freshen up,
till then I will serve breakfast.

63
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,354
Thank you.

64
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:06,577
Okay, not today. Alright,
I'll talk to you later.

65
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,914
Hi. - Hello gorgeous,
welcome to Mumbai.

66
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,382
No, no, darling.
Lesson number one..

67
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,394
..never kiss the cheeks, okay?

68
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,722
Sit.

69
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,129
I'm sorry I'm late
but what could I do.

70
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,131
Vinay wouldn't let me go.

71
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:28,134
Now before you jump into any conclusions,
Vinay Khosla is my boss.

72
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,999
You know the famous
Bollywood designer.

73
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,135
This evening we have to
do fittings for Duggu..

74
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,470
You know last minute changes.
- Duggu?

75
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,681
Duggu.. Hrithik.

76
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,951
Anyway, enough of blabbering.
You tell me how you are.

77
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,146
I'm okay.

78
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,151
When I saw you in that silly
beauty contest in Chandigarh..

79
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,688
I just knew that you
are going to be a star.

80
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,485
Thank you, Rohit.

81
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,553
I'm here because you
showed confidence in me.

82
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,625
Now everything is in your hands.

83
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,161
Don't worry, darling.
I am your man.

84
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:57,766
Do you have your pictures?
- Yes, of course!

85
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,768
Okay, let me have a look.

86
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,636
What's the matter?

87
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:14,450
Nothing. Nothing. Fine.
Interesting, I'll handle it, okay?

88
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,513
Who are you looking for?

89
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,854
Your casting agent.

90
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:20,984
Here?

91
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,921
Shomu, hot shot co-ordinator,
a Godmother to the newcomers.

92
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,525
Don't be too fussy.

93
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,464
Have you ever travelled by
plane before?

94
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,465
I'm sending you to a foreign location.

95
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,870
So what if the role is small?

96
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,469
You will suffer one day.

97
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,136
And Shweta, you have a two day job.

98
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,606
No one gives more than 25,000 rupees
for a Punjabi dance number.

99
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,144
I would have done it,
if I were taller.

100
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,816
Ma'am, you are being called inside.

101
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:49,545
Who is it?

102
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:57,887
Are you new?

103
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,625
Are you from the north?
- Yes.

104
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,157
What size are you?

105
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,693
Small, medium, large?

106
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,027
Listen, I am not interested.

107
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,097
It's the client who wants to know.

108
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,508
I was just about to call you.

109
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,113
I'm sending a girl for the catalogue.
Check her out.

110
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,239
What? What is your name?

111
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,244
Meghna.. Meghna Mathur.

112
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,109
Her name is Meghna Mathur.

113
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,844
Bye.

114
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,512
Okay, listen, You have
an audition tomorrow.

115
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,520
B 409, Adarsh Nagar.
Be there at eleven o'clock.

116
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,651
Take the number from this chick.

117
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,786
Chick?

118
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:30,920
An audition? Tomorrow?

119
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,521
Yes, and listen if it works..

120
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:35,192
..I take a twenty per cent cut.
Is that clear?

121
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,529
Okay.

122
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,539
Stop here, I think this is the place.

123
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,605
How much is it?

124
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:50,940
Fifteen rupees.

125
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,876
Take this.

126
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,958
I recently did two advertisements.

127
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,154
What about you?

128
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,090
I'm an airhostess.

129
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,557
I got bored of serving people..

130
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,899
..so now I want to be a model.

131
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,297
Do you have a problem with that?

132
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,974
No.
- Then stop bothering me.

133
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,566
It is a soap commercial, isn't it?

134
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:18,701
Alright, I will be there.

135
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,576
I am at Adarsh Nagar right now.

136
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,237
I will be at Famous studios in an hour.

137
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,843
Okay, pal, I'll be there, bye.

138
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,586
New?

139
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:35,852
Yes.

140
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,320
Auditioning for the first time?

141
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:39,857
How did you guess?

142
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,130
Only novices walk around
with their portfolio.

143
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,934
Seasoned models, like us,
send it in earlier or email it to them.

144
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,137
By the way, I'm Manav..
Manav Bhasin. - Hello.

145
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,076
A veteran struggler.
Since nine months.

146
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,616
And you?
- Who is Meghna Mathur?

147
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:01,744
That's me.

148
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,220
Please, come in.
- Yes.

149
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,615
All the best.
- Thank you.

150
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,683
Saira Khan..
give me your left profile..

151
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,285
Right profile..

152
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,958
Hi, I am Saira Khan. Age 22..

153
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,159
You can contact me on 98..

154
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,635
Hi.. my name is Meghna Mathur.

155
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:23,107
My mobile number is 9820131 139.

156
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,774
Have patience, darling.

157
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,643
You can't be tired in
just three or four auditions.

158
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,647
It takes up to three
hundred auditions at times..

159
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,046
to finally get a break

160
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,843
Now just relax, okay?
Have your coffee. It's not easy, dear.

161
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,978
Okay. I'll call you later.

162
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,113
One week is over..

163
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,918
Will you do a lingerie advertisement?

164
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,049
Shomu..

165
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:44,324
I have told you a million times,
It's lingerie not lin-guh-ree.

166
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,658
The same thing.

167
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:46,789
Will you do it?

168
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,663
Shomu, just behave yourself,
okay? Meghna is a star.

169
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,134
Meghna won't do such
degrading commercials.

170
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,727
Why are you getting angry?

171
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,670
What is so degrading in
a lingerie advertisement?

172
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,399
Haven't you seen commercially
successful models in calendars?

173
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:57,733
They wear whatever they are told.

174
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,210
Attitude walks in before stardom.

175
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,408
And you go to Bandra.
I'll give you an address.

176
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:03,875
Don't take her seriously.

177
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,884
She just talks nonsense sometimes, okay?

178
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:11,756
Look, just relax, darling.
I've got a surprise for you.

179
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,292
We are going for a fashion
show tomorrow. - Fashion Show?

180
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,693
That too Rahul Arora's fashion show.

181
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:21,164
Rahul Arora! I have only
seen him on television.

182
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:25,101
So tomorrow evening it is
Rahul Arora's fashion show. Live!

183
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,703
Love, I have told you so many times
not to keep your phone switched off.

184
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,038
Because I get worried.

185
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,174
You know, you are becoming
impossible now.

186
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:35,771
Not the same thing again!

187
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,839
I am not being possessive.

188
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,717
I should at least know where you are..

189
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:41,980
..and what you're up to.

190
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,119
That's nonsense and
you know it is not true.

191
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,725
We've been together
since six months..

192
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,318
..and I know you quite well.

193
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,323
No, I don't want to discuss it?

194
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,729
Now what?

195
00:13:58,737 --> 00:13:59,795
Behave..

196
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,737
Come on, Rahul, just once.

197
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:06,744
No.. - Please baby,
say it. Please, darling.

198
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,942
Not right now. - Please,
darling. Please say it, once.

199
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,148
Try to understand.
- Darling, please.

200
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,277
Okay, I am hanging up the phone.

201
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,753
One minute. We are meeting
tonight, aren't we? - Yes.

202
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:20,758
I'll see you soon. Okay?
Okay. Bye. - Rahul..

203
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:21,884
Yes mother..

204
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,422
What can I say?

205
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,758
The whole world is talking.

206
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,767
Everyone is laughing at me.

207
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,032
They say I don't want you to get married.

208
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,097
Let them talk.
How does it affect us?

209
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,767
How can I bear it?

210
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,775
We can't go against society.

211
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,307
It's high time you got married.

212
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,439
Your uncle Kishen from
London had called.

213
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,450
He sent some pictures through email.

214
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,782
Mom! I don't want to see
any pictures of girls.

215
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,253
At least look at them.
- Mom, please..

216
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,257
At least don't bother me today.

217
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,458
Tomorrow is my show
and l' m really nervous.

218
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:06,401
"l know baby that you need me. "

219
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,134
Oh Jassi, what are you doing?

220
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,807
Look straight. Yes.

221
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:13,869
That's good.

222
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,140
And turn.

223
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,216
Make a note. Third sequence.
Dinaz is first.

224
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,487
Girls, walk faster,
this isn't a garden.

225
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,819
Couturier, lets see it.

226
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,020
Now listen quickly get ready for it.
We don't have much time.

227
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,561
And please, concentrate.

228
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,023
Couturier, what is this?

229
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,090
This is the show stopper outfit.

230
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,224
Increase the length of the slit.

231
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,360
There are only three hours
left for the show.

232
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,028
Please leave.
Don't stress me out.

233
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,502
Please, quickly.

234
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,840
Rahul, pay attention now okay?
We have a run through, alright?

235
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,240
Yes, but where is Shonali?

236
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,445
When is she ever punctual
that today will be an exception?

237
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,971
She is your show stopper
and your favourite.

238
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,253
Why aren't we sitting in the front row?
It's absolutely empty.

239
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,847
Are you nuts?
That's reserved seating, darling.

240
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,451
Just watch what happens
there in a while.

241
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,863
Hi.. come on, Jack.

242
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,262
Sir.. sir.. this is reserved, sir.

243
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:13,863
Are you mad? Listen,
this is not the first row like this.

244
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,338
I am leaving, okay?

245
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,873
You know where?
- Yes, sir.

246
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,274
Now come on, speak to Rahul
and arrange for it fast.

247
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,142
Okay, sir. Give me two minutes.
I'll arrange it.

248
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,874
Hello, J.P, I have a situation out here.

249
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,273
Relax, dude.

250
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,350
Sweetie, this is my number, call me.

251
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,488
Hi.

252
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,428
Meghna..
- Yes?

253
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,562
Look there.

254
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:50,506
There in the front row,
that's my boss Vinay Khosla.

255
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,900
He is Rahul's biggest rival..

256
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,912
..and his most loyal audience.

257
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,044
He doesn't miss a single show.

258
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,310
That guy?

259
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,909
Don't you point!
- I am sorry. - This is cheap.

260
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,515
There, right hand corner..

261
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:10,054
That's Ashish Suri..
Rahul's boyfriend.

262
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:11,987
He is so cute, isn't he?

263
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:13,989
I hate Rahul.

264
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,067
Look, front row center.
That's the fashion power list.

265
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,470
She is Shelly Duggal, the editor
of a famous fashion magazine.

266
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:26,934
Sitting to her left, there.. can you
see the lady in the animal print?

267
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,938
Anisha Roy, the owner
of Profiles Agency.

268
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,950
Every top model since the past
six years is from their agency.

269
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,557
Oh, here come Mr. and
Mrs. Abhijeet Sarin.

270
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:41,957

272

The owner of Panache.

273
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:50,627
His brand is the biggest
status symbol in the fashion world.

274
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,699
Everyone dances to
his tunes. Everyone.

275
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,166
Ladies and gentlemen,
can you take your seats?

276
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,177
The show is about to begin.

277

That was Mohsi n, isn't it?

you'll break up and patch up.

00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,715
Shonali, your next change.

You need a good
photographer, baby.

00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,787
Who would you go to
if you were in my place?

351

Kartik Suri, he's your man.

353
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,462
You know Rohit, Kartik is
very busy these days.

354
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:58,004
Traveling, international
photo shoots, you know it.

355
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,313
Okay, Come on, Sonu, look at her.
She is a star, you know it.

356
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,345
What difference will
one photo shoot make?

357
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,548
I'm sure if you put in
a word he will agree.

358
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,481
Look, please.

359
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:13,314
He charges 50,000 rupees,
along with make up and styling.

360
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:14,784
And separate charges for costumes.

361
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,586
Can she afford it?

362
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:19,388
Of course.

363
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,589
But Meghna..

364
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,360
Wait. - Well then,
1 0,000 rupees advance.

365
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,426
Will 7,000 rupees do for now?

366
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,903
I only have that much
with me right now.

367
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,498
But how did you..

368
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,304
I'm making an appointment for..

369
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,902
..the 20th of next month
at eight in the morning.

370
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,042
If you cancel you forfeit
the advance. Okay?

371
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,316
Yes. - Actually..
- That's fine.

372
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,352
Okay. - Seven..
here is the advance.

373
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,322
Manav, I told you earlier as well..

374
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:49,326
..ifyou want to progress in this industry..

375
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,862
..you have to compromise.

376
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:56,322
Come on, do you think
that all the successful models..

377
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,733
..found work just like that?

378
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,404
They also had to compromise.

379
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,544
I can't do what others do.

380
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,606
I want to be successful
on my own terms.

381
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,408
Not like this.

382
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,387
Well, suit yourself.

383
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,382
Anyway, thank you for your time.
Have a good day.

384
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,957
Hi Amar, where are you?

385
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,594
Hi, Mrs. Agarwal..

386
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:33,399
Rohit here, from
Vinay Khosla's office, ma'am.

387
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,969
Ma'am, l' m here with
the outfits for the trial.

388
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,003
Yes, that's right.
- Manav!

389
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,408
Yes.
- Ma'am.. - Oh hi.

390
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,979
Hi, how are you?
- Good, how are you? - Good.

391
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,412
What are you doing here?
Did you have a meeting?

392
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,075
At lunch, ma'am? - Yes,
a kind of.. - I didn't do it till now.

393
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,112
That's what I came here for,
but it didn't work out.

394
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,586
Anyway. - I'll see you after lunch.
- I'll see you later.

395
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:56,585
Okay, bye.
- Okay.

396
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:04,427
Who is that?
- Just a friend.. model.

397
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,003
You should have at least
introduced me to him.

398
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,700
He's quite hot.
- Rohit.

399
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:14,441
Now what?
- Lunch.

400
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:19,440
Enjoy, Meghna.
I only have mineral water.

401
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,751
Especially when someone
else is paying the bill.

402
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:26,822
But how can we eat out here,
it's so expensive.

403
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,016
Just relax, okay?

404
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,691
Mrs. Agarwal is an NRl.
She is very rich.

405
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:36,493
She told me to have lunch
and add the bill to her account.

406
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,036
Shomu called today.
- What? - Yes.

407
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:43,470
She said there is
a party at some hotel.

408
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,173
If I have to make contacts,
I must go.

409
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:47,636
Should I go?

410
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,509
Of course, you should go Meghna!

411
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,510
Networking is very important.

412
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,677
What fun!

413
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,179
Lunch and dinner both
at a five star hotel.

414
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:58,513
You are on a roll.

415
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:05,721
"Hey baby!"

416
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:11,926
Sorry. Hi, Janet here.

417
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,104
Stop fooling around.

418
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,867
The girls have been waiting in
the lobby since long.

419
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,473
Listen, there are three girls..

420
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,738
..one ofthem is new.

421
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,512
Just explain it to them.
Properly, okay?

422
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,209
Yes, I'll be there in five minutes.

423
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,511
Sorry, Sameer,
I have to go.

424
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,516
Working, you know.
Love doesn't provide food.

425
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:33,749
Sameer?

426
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,025
Not Sameer, honey, Sohail.

427
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:41,556
Oh, it's my fault. Sorry. Bye.

428
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,024
Stay together, okay?
- Okay.

429
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:45,969
Where is Bajaj?

430
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,231
Hello Janet!
- Hello!

431
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,029
Welcome to the party,
how are you?

432
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,506
Very well. How are you doing?
- Come. Come.

433
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:52,543
Come. Come. - Let me introduce
you to my friends.

434
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,707
Sir.. Janet, meet Mr..
- Hi.

435
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,248
A young businessman from Oman.

436
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:59,908
Hi. - And sir, meet Ms. Janet.

437
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,112
She is a very well-known
model from Mumbai.

438
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,518
Hi.. very nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

439
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:04,713
Nice meeting you.

440
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,915
Meet my friends, Shaheen.
- Hi. - The music video queen.

441
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,988
The 'Kanta laga' type.

442
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,093
She is Meghna.
- Hello.

443
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:16,600
The famous super hit
Bollywood item girl.

444
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:21,565
She is Anita, the famous
calendar girl. - Hello.

445
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:22,764
Hi!

446
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,848
One vodka with coconut
water on it. Vodka?

447
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:41,953
No thank you, I don't drink.

448
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:47,154
Drink up. It's free and imported too.

449
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:52,767
Shomu said that I could
make some contacts here.

450
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,165
Drink ma'am. - Contacts?
And that too here?

451
00:27:56,975 --> 00:28:01,309
Just smile and look pretty
for the photographs.

452
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,707
And then our job is done.
That's it!

453
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,780
Thank you. - Janet!
- Yes Bajaj, coming.

454
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,994
Good party, isn't it?
Mukesh Tyagi.

455
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:23,858
I run an ad agency.
Talent Unlimited and you?

456
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,634
Meghna Mathur..

457
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,336
You are a model, right?

458
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,270
No, not as yet but hopefully..

459
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,866
Come on, you look professional.

460
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,603
Send me some of your photographs.

461
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,012
I suggest that you
drop in to my office.

462
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,640
I have good contacts..
perhaps I can help you.

463
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,613
Sure.. - Do one thing,
this is my card and..

464
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:47,647
call me up on my mobile.
- Okay?

465
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,054
Janet, Meet Mr..

466
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,358
Mukesh Tyagi.
He runs an ad agency. Yes.

467
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,688
Talent Unlimited.

468
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,665
"Send me your pictures, "

469
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,802
Or "drop into my office, "

470
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,333
He says he has a lot of contacts.

471
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:02,265
He has been doing the party
rounds since the past five years.

472
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:04,672
Listen, fraud..

473
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,905
..with those old lines, you
won't catch any fish. - Go from here.

474
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:14,177
What's the problem with
you small town girls?

475
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,180
Anyone who speaks halfway decent English,
can get anywhere with you.

476
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:19,714
Come on, let's go.

477
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,051
You want to make contacts.

478
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:26,357
Janet, Reema, Meghna.

479
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:31,829
Dolly, that's your 15,000.
I've cut five for the advance.

480
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,393
There are 1 0,000 in the packet.
- Okay, fine.

481
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:34,729
And here's your 1 8,000.

482
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:35,965
Don't ask for conveyance.

483
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,400
We've got a party like this
after a month. Get it.

484
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,410
And Meghna..

485
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,739
It's your first time so
I'm paying you 1 2,000.

486
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,412
What are you looking at?
Here take it.

487
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:49,811
Don't want it?

488
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,949
No.. but.. money?

489
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:55,882
You're paid for the work you did.

490
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,285
Work?

491
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,420
Didn't you pose for the camera?

492
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,832
People like having girls
at such parties.

493
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,897
Mr. Bajaj is an event manager..

494
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,801
..he contacts me for the models.

495
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,704
It's like this..

496
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,744
..pretty girls increase the glamour
quotient for such parties.

497
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,306
High society calls this
eye candy, understood?

498
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,439
Here take this.

499
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:18,773
Here.

500
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,752
And here, Reema.

501
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,011
What's this? Where have you been?
- What do I do?

502
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,747
Don't you want your money?
What should I do?

503
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,726
The world of glamour is strange..

504
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:33,730
..you are so desperate
to achieve success..

505
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:38,394
..that the difference between
what's right and wrong begins to blur.

506
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,128
To be honest, there's barely
any time to think about it.

507
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:47,737
As the date for the portfolio got closer..

508
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,781
..my hopes began to diminish.

509
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,945
Meghna darling,
why are you so tense?

510
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,150
Everything will work out,
dear. I promise.

511
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,347
How is it possible, Rohit?

512
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,755
Only six days to go for the portfolio..

513
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,884
..and I still don't have the money.

514
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,488
You know what he said..

515
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,763
If I don't pay the entire amount..

516
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:07,889
..then I forfeit the advance.

517
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,793
And I still have 30,000 to go.

518
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,065
Meghna, if you don't mind..

519
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,167
Shomu's offer is still open.

520
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:16,831
I don't know.

521
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,167
You could give it a try.

522
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,808
It's worth a shot.

523
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:22,871
Lingerie?

524
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,878
"Beautiful lady. "

525
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:31,319
"Drive me crazy. "

526
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:36,827
"Beautiful lady. "

527
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,053
Janet, show some more skin.

528
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,465
I've shown enough for
what I've been paid. Get it?

529
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:42,829
Fine, let's get on with it.

530
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,025
"Come on, "

531
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:48,103
"Beautiful lady. "

532
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,333
"You drive me crazy. "

533
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:55,277
"You drive me crazy. "

534
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:58,406
Don't feel shy.

535
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,813
It's weird for the first ten seconds..

536
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:03,115
..after that, you will get used to it.

537
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,929
Come on madam.
Take off your gown.

538
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,228
There are other models
waiting for the shoot.

539
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,566
Quickly, there are three more to go.

540
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,104
Come on madam,
make it quick.

541
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,348
Just feel free, do not stress.

542
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,435
Take this.
- Meghna, relax.

543
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:53,970
Archana.. very good.

544
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,938
Have some tea,
you will feel better. - No.

545
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,502
Okay, left profile now.

546
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,607
Janet, your cheque.
- Thank you.

547
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,209
Meghna, that's yours. You remember
my commission, right?

548
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:07,876
Yes, but Shomu are you sure this..

549
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:10,921
..advertisement won't be released here?

550
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,555
I told you that it won't get released here.

551
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:16,286
This advertisement is only for Sri Lanka
and Bangladesh. Is that clear?

552
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,019
Don't worry.

553
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:21,591
You've done the advertisement now, so..

554
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:25,300
Now chin up.
- Just have a smoke and chill.

555
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,302
Thanks. I don't smoke.

556
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,443
Meghna, don't think so much.

557
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:37,039
The lesser you think,
the more you will make.

558
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,347
Thanks Janet.

559
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:47,114
Oh yes. Tomorrow is
your portfolio shoot, isn't it?

560
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:52,055
Yes. - All the best.
I know you'll rock. - Thanks.

561
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:53,962
Okay guys, let's get this done.

562
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:59,937
Alright.. just look up a bit.
Relax, yes. Okay.

563
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,164
Now look at me. Smile.

564
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,130
Yes, nice. That's good.

565
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,271
Look at me and chin down.
Chin down.

566
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:09,336
Chin down.
- Chin slightly down. Relax now.

567
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,143
Okay. Do it again!
- Sorry.

568
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,973
Smile.. yes. Much better.

569
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,176
Okay, great.

570
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,687
Look at me. That's a nice smile.
Hold that.

571
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,013
Hold that pose.

572
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,316
Superb!

573
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,985
Anisha, didn't I mention that..

574
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:28,063
I haven't seen a striking
impressive face recently.

575
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:31,434
And I finally found one.
She is unbelievable.

576
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:35,995
Irene.
- Yes, ma'am.

577
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:38,366
Send in the Kartik girl, please.
- Okay.

578
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,011
Meghna Mathur!
That's me!

579
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,571
So you want to be a model?

580
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:47,041
No ma'am.

581
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,043
A super model.

582
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,080
Ambitious.

583
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,993
Do you know the city gets
two hundred girls everyday..

584
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,322
..who aspire to be a model.

585
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,257
I know.

586
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,990
But.. how many of them..

587
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:07,037
..get a chance to sit across you?

588
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,034
Kartik was right, you have spunk.
- Thank you.

589
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:16,643
But that will not suffice.

590
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,608
What did you tell me your name was?

591
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:23,047
Meghna..
- Yes, Meghna.

592
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,022
Meghna, in the fashion industry..

593
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:31,425
..even a little talent will do.

594
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,021
But if you have the wrong attitude..

595
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,123
..nothing will work.

596
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,761
You have attitude.

597
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,438
Use it with prudence or
it will be mistaken for arrogance.

598
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:47,569
That won't happen.

599
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:50,104
Really!

600
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:52,340
Yes.

601
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:57,318
Won't you be there to guide me?

602
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,089
I like your confidence.

603
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,352
What are you doing tomorrow?

604
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,353
Nothing yet.

605
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:16,164
Not good?

606
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:21,677
Oh, horrible.

607
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,510
Actually, I don't know
a lot about wines.

608
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:28,708
Don't worry there are
very few over here who do.

609
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:30,280
At least you are honest.

610
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,113
Ross, two glasses of Merlot, please.

611
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:40,390
Try this, you'll like it.
- Okay.

612
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,230
Still the same.

613
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,107
You've either tried wine for..

614
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,143
..the first time or had a lot of it.

615
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:54,503
That's why you can't tell the difference.

616
00:36:54,745 --> 00:37:00,183
By the way, I am Abhijeet Sarin.
- I know you, everybody knows you.

617
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:03,210
I am Meghna Mathur.
- Now I know you.

618
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,520
Want to try something more interesting?

619
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,717
Yes.. - Come, let's go.
- Okay. Come.

620
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,355
Cheers.

621
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,856
These models are so thin.

622
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,463
I've heard they do drugs?

623
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,396
I don't know. Not all of them,
maybe a few.

624
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,363
And guess what, Sheetal..

625
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:25,141
I heard that designer
Varun Ramani's wife is..

626
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:28,201
having an affair with her gym instructor.

627
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,541
Then you know the latest.

628
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:34,182
Rajan Sodhi has hidden
cameras in his wife's bedroom.

629
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,187
And? - And guess what,
she got caught.

630
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,219
What are you saying?

631
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:45,885
I just don't understand. How can
people get into such situations?

632
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:53,768
Does she know this?

633
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:17,658
You seem quite intelligent.
so what's this craze for modelling?

634
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:23,789
You too are intelligent and
are also in the same business.

635
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,795
So the comparison is with me..

636
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,737
It's not like that..

637
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,407
It doesn't matter.

638
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,836
I judge people by their ambition.

639
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:38,446
Really, so what do you think of me?

640
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,283
You've hardly told me
anything about yourself..

641
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,220
What can I say?
Like thousands of girls..

642
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,621
I too want to be a successful model.

643
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:51,953
But there's a small difference.
- What's that?

644
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:57,826
That l' m better than the rest.

645
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,430
That you are.

646
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,843
Come, let's go.
- Yes.

647
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,248
You know you're very lucky,
Meghna.. What?

648
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:18,311
You've been meeting these people..
Kartik.. Sarin.

649
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,250
The formula to this business is..

650
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:24,988
the right timing, knowing the right
people and the right publicity.

651
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,331
I've thought about it.

652
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,866
I will feature you in Leena Mehta's show.

653
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,337
Really? - It is a big show. - Yeah.

654
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,276
Everything is happening so quickly..

655
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,335
..don't get overconfident.

656
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,505
This is just the first step.

657
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:49,650
Everything depends on what
you make of this opportunity.

658
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,513
And, where you want to go from here.

659
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:57,891
I know where I want to reach.

660
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,554
Shona.. - Ritu? Why is she calling you?

661
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,354
Shona my phone..
-You told me she doesn't call you.

662
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:32,553
Shona, give me my phone..

663
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,688
-Why did you lie to me?
- Leave my phone.

664
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,562
Why is she calling you? You fool!
You lied to me? - She needs help.

665
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,602
Shona, give me my phone.
- Why? - What are you doing?

666
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:39,727
Are you the only one who can help her?

667
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,739
Shona.. - You fool, you are doing it again.
You are lying to me.

668
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:45,865
Let me talk to her. I need to talk to her.
- Shona, leave it.

669
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,001
Shona!

670
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,411
You fool! I have a show tomorrow.

671
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,717
Come on, Shona. I told you
there is nothing like that.

672
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,489
She just needs help.

673
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,358
This is my Avant-garde collection.

674
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:06,862
It's completely different
from my earlier work.

675
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:10,367
I mean, this collection is inspired
by my childhood memories.

676
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,101
My mother, my grandmother!

677
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:15,432
You will see influences
of those images.

678
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,373
I don't know how it is going to be..

679
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,376
..accepted, but it is very special to me.

680
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:22,378
What's this? Made in Bangkok.

681
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:25,044
At least she should have taken
off the label before the show.

682
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,378
She gets it from the
lndra market in Bangkok..

683
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,976
and calls it her
Avant-garde collection.

684
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:32,383
Some designer.

685
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,822
Darling, you are looking beautiful.

686
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:35,950
Look here..

687
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:40,396
Slowly, it hurts.
- Sorry.

688
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:52,405
Salim, darling.
I am the show stopper.

689
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,941
Come over for my make-up
or should I stop the show?

690
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,410
Can you just finish it by yourself?
- It is okay.

691
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:01,542
Thank you.

692
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:07,848
Yes, darling.

693
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,486
You look sad.
-Not at all.

694
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,619
Would you like to go back?

695
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,162
No. Let's just do your make-up.

696
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:27,541
Please, show me. Show me.

697
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,036
Next.. next.

698
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,180
This?
- Yes. Print this.

699
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,111
Okay.
- Thank you, bye.

700
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:36,447
Okay, ma'am. No problem.

701
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,720
Chandu, why are you
clicking a nobody?

702
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:44,192
Fool, do you know how
big a socialite she is?

703
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:47,823
Socialite? Once upon
a time she was a B-grade actress.

704
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,127
Today she is a self proclaimed
socialite and designer.

705
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:52,526
Are you kidding me?

706
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:56,596
She is at every function
- weddings, parties, awards..

707
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,471
She doesn't even spare baby showers.

708
00:42:58,542 --> 00:42:59,600
Are you kidding me?

709
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:00,735
Baby shower?

710
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:01,869
Yes, even baby showers.

711
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:06,512
Delete her pictures. Terrible!

712
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:12,045
Oh hi!
- How are you?

713
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,787
I am fine. What brings you here?

714
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,650
Well, I came to meet Leena.
Networking, you know.

715
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,028
I got to know that it is your first show so..

716
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:24,033
I came to wish you luck.
- Thanks.

717
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,968
All the best. - Thanks.
Thank you. - And.. - Thanks.

718
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:30,172
Don't be nervous,
you'll be just fine, okay?

719
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,511
Pooja.. isn't that Madhur Bhandarkar?

720
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:36,972
What's he doing with Rita?

721
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,114
He's probably doing his research.

722
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:40,841
He's making a movie on fashion.

723
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,247
He makes realistic films.

724
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,246
He won't even spare
the world of fashion.

725
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:47,854
Now remember, I want a lot of drama.

726
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:51,122
Is that clear? - Look at the clothes.
They are so dramatic.

727
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:54,526
No expression. I just want you
to look straight, look strong..

728
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:56,589
..no smiles. Am I clear?

729
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,030
Binal, walk tall and beautiful.

730
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:04,538
Meghna. - Yes.
- This is a huge show for you.

731
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:07,074
I want lots of attitude.
Do you understand that?

732
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,705
Yes.. yes, ma'am.
- And Shonali.. Shonali.

733
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,272
Yes, yes. I know, I am listening.

Yes, okay. Okay, she is on. She is on.

746
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,374
"For your love, I shall give up my life. "

747
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,883
"Your Kohl enchants me. "

"It's the time to fall in love. "

749

00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,445
That was such an i m pressive show.

755
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:08,350
You were fantastic as always, Shonali.

756
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,387
Thank you so m uch.

757
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,354
Panache is extremely proud of you.

758
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,293
You are the face of Panache.

759
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,900
We'll have to extend your contract.

760
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,458
Oh, come on Abhi,
stop discussing work.

761
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:20,930
Shonali, join us for a drink.

762
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,406
Come on..
- Yes, come on.

763
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:25,134
Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

764
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:27,801
No. Really. Really.

765
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:28,936
Wasn't that amazing?

766
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,070
She just walked on.
- Thank you.

767
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:31,273
And beyond looked at..

768
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,782
You were fantastic,
fabulous. - Really?

769
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,284
Really. - Thank you.
Thank you so much.

770
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,412
What grace.. what poise.. oh my God.

771
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:41,150
I was so nervous. Janet Sequeira!

772
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:43,789
Rahul Arora!
- Oh my God.

773
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,231
How long it has been?
- Six years.

774
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:51,125
Look at you.

775
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:53,797
How much weight have
you lost since college?

776
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:54,929
I had to diet to become a model.

777
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,499
And dieting made me like this.

778
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,503
You and diet?

779
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,775
You know.. Rohit, right?
- Yes.

780
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:03,437
You know.. when we were in college..
- Yes.

781
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:05,777
During college she used
to carry a box of sugar candy.

782
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:09,046
Sugar! Calories!

783
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,145
We all used laugh at her.

784
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:14,046
Should I reveal your secrets?

785
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,524
Oh.. no secrets, okay?
- Okay.

786
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,455
Besides I am very upset with you.
- Why?

787
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,463
You are a model now and
you didn't even bother to call.

788
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,260
Rahul, you know this business.

789
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:26,994
You are an A list designer
and I'm a struggling B list model.

790
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:28,262
How could I call?

791
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:30,801
You know it is not like that
with me, right? - Yes, I know..

792
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:33,799
Give me a call.
- I will.

793
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:37,138
Okay, by the way meet my friend, Meghna.

794
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,079
Hi.. - Nice meeting you.
- Rahul Arora.

795
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,140
Yes, of course. I've heard..
- You were great on the ramp.

796
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:42,810
Good confidence.
Good presence. Right?

797
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:47,550
Thank you. Thank you so much.
- I will. Bye. - Bye.

798
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:51,093
You know him? - Yes.
- You never told us. - Well..

799
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,152
Hi Christine.
- Hi, Christine.

800
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:54,930
Well done, Meghna.

801
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,829
Such good confidence in your first show..

802
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,097
..I'm really impressed.
- Really?

803
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,968
I am sure, you'll go a long way. Bye.

804
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:08,867
Did you hear that Meghna darling?
You will go a long way.

805
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,345
Very well done. Very well done.

806
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:13,008
I told you so.
- lmagine.

807
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,437
After many trials and troubles
I reached a place..

808
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:42,604
..where I could see my dream
taking shape clearly.

809
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,146
But my journey ahead went
through strange phases.

810
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:51,887
Old relationships though
near seemed far away.

811
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:54,890
And new relationships
started growing closer.

812
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:02,998
This restaurant is really posh, Meghna.

813
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:04,932
We are going to get a huge bill.

814
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,560
Just relax and order.

815
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:08,467
It's very..
- lts okay.

816
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:13,340
Hey Rahul! Hi!
- Hi! - How are you?

817
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,900
How are you doing?
- Very well.

818
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:16,502
Do you know, Meghna.. Manav..
- Hi.

819
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,638
Rohit..
- Hi.

820
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:20,573
Hi.. this is Ashish.
- Hi. - Hi. - Nice meeting you.

821
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:22,483
Why don't you guys join us?

822
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,653
Yes, sure. Sure.

823
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:27,214
Sure.
- Okay.

824
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:28,923
Excuse me.
- Yes. - Two chairs, please.

825
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,050
Yes.
- Sure, sir.

826
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,088
You haven't changed a bit.
-Why do you say that?

827
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:36,930
I was just being polite and
you actually joined us.

828
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:39,595
How rude.
- I can't believe this.

829
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:42,661
You know, throughout college,
I used to foot her canteen bills.

830
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,540
So I thoug ht it was payback time today.

831
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:47,099
To say..
- By the way..

832
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,269
Unfortunately, it's Meghna's treat.

833
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:49,937
Oh, I am sorry.
- Yes, this is my treat.

834
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:51,674
Come on, let's order starters guys.

835
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:53,277
Hi..
- Hi.

836
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,518
Can I ask you something?
-Sure

837
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,956
Do you have a brother
or cousin who looks..

838
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:01,456
..just like you do.

839
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:04,956
Sorry, bad luck.
- No.. - Oh no!

840
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:12,963
Listen, you do know that..

841
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:15,630
the venue for tomorrows rehearsal has
changed, don't you? - Really?

842
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:16,967
It's Four Seasons now.

843
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:20,707
Anyways, thanks for telling me.
- Oh no, not at all.

844
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:22,103
Bye.
- Bye, take care.

845
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,512
Bye.
- See you. Bye.

846
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,351
Santosh..

847
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:38,722
It's two in the morning, Meghna.

848
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:41,429
You've been coming in late every night.

849
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:44,000
You should be a little more responsible.

850
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:46,195
Even the neighbours are complaining.

851
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,003
This can't continue here.

852
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:51,668
I'm sorry, aunt, but my job keeps me..

853
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:53,106
I know what it keeps you at.

854
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:58,572
Divya brought this to
show us from the neighbors.

855
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:01,016
What influence will it have on her?

856
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:05,016
Meghna, we can't let your career be..

857
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:07,215
..a negative influence on Divya.

858
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:10,023
I suggest you..

859
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:12,027
..Iook for alternate accommodation.

860
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:14,690
Santosh, it's so late in the night..

861
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:16,698
She doesn't need to leave immediately.

862
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:20,030
She can leave after a couple of days.

863
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:21,595
It's okay aunt..

864
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:24,332
I'll leave right away.

865
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:33,538
Janet.
- Hi, how are you?

866
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:35,050
Hi.. sorry to call you so late.
- What?

867
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,052
I'm on my way to Goa.
Is everything all right?

868
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,783
Anything urgent,
message me, darling.

869
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:42,183
No. Nothing at all.

870
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,727
Okay, yes.
- Okay. Bye. - Bye. - See you.

871
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:55,803
I left home in a huff but
I didn't know where to go.

872
00:52:56,806 --> 00:53:00,333
Janet is in Goa and
Rohit stays with his parents.

873
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:03,242
I don't know anyone else in Mumbai.

874
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,376
I'm really sorry but..

875
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:06,813
There is no need for an explanation.

876
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,611
I'm glad that you called.

877
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,552
It's only for tonight.

878
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,483
I'll look for another place tomorrow.

879
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:17,150
Meghna, this is Mumbai.

880
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:19,755
You may find God but not accommodation.

881
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,492
That too, a single woman..

882
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:24,657
..a model, no way.

883
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:29,100
Yes, there is one place though..

884
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:31,367
..where you can share an apartment.

885
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:33,709
Where?
- Here.

886
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:39,376
Actually, I was looking
for a room mate.

887
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:43,113
I don't have regular work..

888
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:45,154
..and the rent is too high.

889
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,554
So, if you don't mind.
We can share this apartment.

890
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:52,127
But Manav, both of us..

891
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:54,163
..in the same apartment..

892
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,495
..won't it be awkward?

893
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,200
Come on Meghna,
this isn't Chandigarh.

894
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,130
I mean, no one cares.

895
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:08,134
Rent, provisions..
we'll share the expenses.

896
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,137
We can share everything..

897
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:14,809
..but the bedrooms will be separate, right?

898
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,688
Of course! They will be separate,
you can be sure of that.

899
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,598
Okay.
- Okay.

900
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:31,156
Okay, great! Welcome home.

901
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:33,165
Anisha, I'm sorry I had to call you.

902
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,496
Where is Shonali?

903
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:36,163
The entire unit has been
waiting for two hours..

904
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:37,900
..there is no sign of her.

905
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:39,232
This has become a habit.

906
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:41,334
Please, help me.
Please do something now. - Oh no!

907
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:44,442
Tony, give me two minutes.

908
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,754
Shonali..
- She is in there.

909
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,722
Shonali.. come out of there.

910
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,489
Come out, right now!

911
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,193
What's your problem Anisha?

912
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,263
The entire unit has been
waiting for two hours..

913
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,326
It's a big ad film shoot,
for heaven sake.

914
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:09,599
And you are back
to this awful habit.

915
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:15,844
You better buck up,
Shonali.

916
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,474
This is the third complaint.

917
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:22,309
Our clients pay a lot of
money for your time.

918
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:24,217
It's only because of
my agency and my reputation..

919
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,221
..that's the reason you
stand here today.

920
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:28,213
Ifyou don' take control of yourself..

921
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,692
..then there are several others
who are eager to replace you. Got it?

922
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,898
Don't worry..
- Megha, Gauri..

923
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,969
If she misbehaves,
call me up again.

924
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,248
"Temptation next"

925
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:55,750
"Temptation next "

926
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,256
No.. don't argue Koko.
I know exactly..

927
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:04,316
..what's going to be good on you,
okay? Trust me.

928
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,453
Vinay, isn't this a bit over the top?

929
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:09,264
I mean.. just look at this.

930
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:13,929
You are about to do
Bobby Chopra's film in Europe.

931
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:18,532
And today everything is about looking
glamorous. Okay? - Yes, but.

932
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,735
You guys do very realistic films and..

933
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:25,676
Yes, I mean, this is mainstream
cinema and you have to look hot.

934
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:29,542
I am the only one who can make
you look hot. Okay? Period.

935
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:31,011
I don't know, Vinay.

936
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:33,854
According to my character graph,
I mean.. - Dear, no..

937
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,848
Ranveer, just help me. Just look.

938
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:39,284
Koko, the amount the producer is
spending on your clothes..

939
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:42,297
exceeds the total budget
of this film production.

940
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:44,959
So if you're done arguing,
can we rehearse?

941
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:46,632
The entire unit has been
waiting for two hours..

942
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:48,295
..and a lot of people work on daily wages.

943
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,899
Wages.
- Okay, Vinay, whatever.

944
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,032
Come on, roll the camera.

945
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:55,300
Its fine, I surrender.
- Baby, trust me. You'll rock.

946
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:58,814
Really? - You doubt Vinay Khosla?
Come on, baby.

947
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:00,748
Come on, take it.

948
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:03,911
Hey Manav, whom are you paired
with in Anamika's show?

949
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,480
I have been paired with Rajneesh.

950
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:07,380
Not anymore.

951
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:08,715
What do you mean?

952
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,856
Now your entry is along with me.

953
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:12,521
We open the show together now.

954
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,794
Really? But how come?

955
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,324
Because our choreographer believes..

956
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,867
..that we make a great pair.

957
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:20,495
And I agree.

958
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:42,422
"It's special. "

959
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,086
"It's an unusual feeling. "

960
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:50,093
"Some distance, closeness,,

961
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:53,858
..keeps my loneliness away. "

962
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:57,634
"ls it love?"

963
00:57:57,707 --> 00:58:01,108
"ls it trust? Maybe it's love. "

964
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:05,370
"This is blossoms. This waiting.. "

965
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:09,384
"Maybe it's love. "

966
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:16,956
"It's special. "

967
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:20,792
"It's an unusual feeling. "

968
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:24,664
"Some distance, closeness,,

969
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:28,397
..keeps my loneliness away. "

970
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:32,134
"ls it love?"

971
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:36,003
"ls it trust? Maybe it's love. "

972
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,845
"This is blossoms. This waiting.. "

973
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:43,784
"Maybe it's love. "

974
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:08,576
"What to say?"

975
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:16,844
"Show your heart someone close to you, "

976
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:24,186
"l had a condition. "

977
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:31,832
"l feel I have won this lost round. "

978
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:35,471
"This is impatient waiting.. "

979
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:39,668
"Maybe it's love. "

980
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:43,143
"It's magic. "

981
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:45,476
"Maybe it's love. "

982
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:48,479
"Maybe it's love. "

983
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:53,215
"Maybe it's love. "

984
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:58,721
"Something is special, "

985
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:02,991
"It's an unusual feeling. "

986
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,255
"Maybe it's love. "

987
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:38,529
"Maybe it's love. "

988
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:48,604
Just see..
- Let me read.

989
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:51,273
Forget what you are reading.
Just look at that.

990
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:53,578
Please give me the phone.
-No.

991
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,277
Give me the phone.
- No way, please.

992
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:56,911
Forget your phone.

993
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,746
Oh hi, Anisha.

994
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:00,880
Where are you?

995
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:02,288
At home.

996
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,559
Sarin wants to see you immediately.

997
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:06,619
Right now?

998
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,561
No questions Meghna.
Please go over right now.

999
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,758
Okay, I'll go. Bye.

1000
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:23,743
Meghna, please come.
- Oh.. come.

1001
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:39,686
Anisha told me.. I had to rush..
to come to see you.. in the office.

1002
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:44,061
I've brought my portfolio along.
I also have it on CD.

1003
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,325
Ifyou want to have a look.

1004
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,065
There's no need for this.

1005
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:53,073
Would you like to be a show stopper?

1006
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:56,137
It's for Vinay Khosla.

1007
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:58,671
The show is in four days.

1008
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,217
You think you'll be able to do it?

1009
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,288
Vinay Khosla? - Yes.

1010
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:10,959
Oh my God, you mean
'The Vinay Khosla?' - That's right.

1011
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:16,024
Yes, of course. Thank you.

1012
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:22,632
For the first time,

1013
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:25,640
I don't have a single Bollywood
starlet in the front row. - So sad.

1014
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,300
Half ofthem are doing shows and..

1015
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:28,638
..the other half are abroad.
- Oh what a pity?

1016
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:31,642
What's happening with
the new girl? Is she ready?

1017
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:34,774
Just two minutes. - No, no.
you go and check. Go. Go! - Okay.

1018
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:36,644
I've got a very huge offer.

1019
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:42,055
Ladies and gentlemen,
kindly take your seat.

1020
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:44,184
The show is about to begin.

1021
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,652
Darling, you look gorgeous.

1022
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:47,787
And you are biased.

1023
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:50,993
No, no Meghna. It goes over.

1024
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,201
But it looks so much cooler here.

1025
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:57,662
She is an absolute new girl.
And a show stopper?

1026
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:00,936
And handsome looks.
Handsome looks, okay? - Okay.

1027
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:03,672
I just hope she is good.
I just hope. - Okay.

1028
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:06,340
I am so stressed. I am so stressed.
This is not funny. - Relax.

1029
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:07,939
Sarin's recommendation and all that.

1030
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:11,680
Anyway, I'll just.. where is Rohit?

1031
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:13,746
Just you know..
- Where is Rohit?

1032
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,780
Meghna, you should.. because..

1033
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,883
Meghna, I was telling you..
- Rohit.

1034
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:26,428
Oh what the.. who the hell
has done it like this?

1035
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,694
It is supposed to go
above the head, no?

1036
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:30,238
Rohit..
- Yes.. - Duffer..

1037
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,173
You know how particular I am.

1038
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:34,368
Actually.. It's not his fault.
I told him.

1039
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,035
You?

1040
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:37,371
I thought that if..

1041
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:41,439
Hold it. You thought?
Darling, you are a model.

1042
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:44,444
You don't need to
use your brains, okay?

1043
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,017
Spare me the horror.

1044
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,716
Fix the lousy thing, Rohit.
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1045
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:50,725
It's such an insignificant thing..

1046
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:56,064
What did you say?
An insignificant thing?

1047
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:58,790
This is the show stopper outfit.

1048
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:00,394
Do you understand that?

1049
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,935
The media will be watching.
All of them.

1050
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:05,735
And even ifyou sell yourself,

1051
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:07,935
you can't afford this dress. Alright?

1052
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:11,736
And listen,
I really don't care about..

1053
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:14,248
..your relationship with Sarin.

1054
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,411
I don't want supermodel nonsense.

1055
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:17,975
My relationship with Sarin?

1056
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:21,255
You have no right to say that.
- Oh yeah? Really?

1057
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:25,488
I don't have a right?
In my show?

1058
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:28,252
Do you even know,
who I am?

1059
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:32,492
Vinay Khosla..
and nobody talks to me like that.

1060
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:38,203
Rohit, tell Christina I am
replacing this girl right now.

1061
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:39,434
Change the whole thing.

1062
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:42,033
Send four girls in the end.
Change the finale. I don't care.

1063
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:44,875
And you! Out ofthis outfit and leave! Out!

1064
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,316
But sir.. No.. no..
-What! - Nothing, sir.

1065
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,318
Come on, now all of you get on with it.

1066
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:51,785
Come on, back to work.

1067
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:55,819
No wonder we models are
treated like hangers.

1068
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:33,559
Okay girls, listen. Quickly listen.
There's been a change, alright?

1069
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:36,229
I want the last four girls
to end the sequence.

1070
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:38,290
The last four girls being Geeta..
you right?

1071
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:40,267
What about that young girl?
- Don't know about her.

1072
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:42,061
Thank you. Excuse me.

1073
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:43,867
Sir, there is a problem backstage.
I think you should come.

1074
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:47,838
Okay. Excuse me.

1075
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:56,312
What the hell.
She has ruined the whole show.

1076
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:58,853
What's the problem, Vinay?
- She's arrogant.

1077
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:00,047
Why don't you ask him?

1078
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:04,525
Don't believe me, then..
- Alright. - Sarin..

1079
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,426
Meghna!

1080
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:24,610
Meghna, you still have those bangles..
We need them back..

1081
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:31,216
I am sorry. I am sorry.

1082
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:34,552
I am really sorry about this.
- It's okay.

1083
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:17,291
How could he think that l..

1084
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,526
Calm down, Meghna.

1085
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,402
People say stuff when they're angry.

1086
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:24,971
You could've controlled yourself.

1087
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,408
So it was my fault?

1088
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:31,170
Do you even know what he said?

1089
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:33,044
- Listen, I know it wasn't your fault.

1090
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,077
Besides he is a veteran designer
and you are new to modelling.

1091
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:41,383
Does that mean he can say
whatever he wants?

1092
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:44,959
So what if he is a reputed designer?

1093
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:46,961
I'm no average model either.

1094
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:48,223
Come on, I know, Meghna.

1095
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,499
You'll never understand.

1096
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:01,971
Tell me Anisha..

1097
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:05,173
..when is Shonali's contract up for renewal?

1098
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,376
There is time yet.

1099
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:13,087
Five months I think, why?

1100
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:14,715
Terminate her contract.

1101
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:17,987
Right now!

1102
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:23,556
But Sarin, we can't do that.

1103
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:24,994
Why not?

1104
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:27,592
Panache is my company
and I can do whatever I want.

1105
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,198
But.. it's a contract.

1106
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,002
I mean..

1107
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:34,303
..it hasn't expired as yet.

1108
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,240
Give Shonali full compensation..

1109
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:38,007
..in fact give her a little more..

1110
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,274
..so that there are no complaints.

1111
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:43,374
But.. - No questions.
Just do it.

1112
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:49,016
But on what grounds?

1113
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:52,551
Come on, Anisha.
You are smart.

1114
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:54,752
You'll think of something.
I am sure.

1115
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:04,229
I don't understand,
why, Anisha? Why?

1116
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,703
I warned you a couple of times earlier..

1117
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:10,039
..but you didn't listen.

1118
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:12,508
Three official complaints!

1119
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:15,240
Ultimately professionalism counts.

1120
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,353
Come on Anisha,
I know this profession.

1121
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,456
Three complaints and I am out?

1122
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:25,718
It's not just that, Shonali.

1123
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:27,056
Your lifestyle..

1124
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:28,626
..your boyfriends..

1125
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:31,793
..your addiction and
misbehaviour at parties.

1126
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:35,230
It's affecting the brands,
especially Panache.

1127
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:38,697
This was bound to happen someday.

1128
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:45,437
Anyway..
I didn't want to be unfair.

1129
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:48,076
The compensation is higher.

1130
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:50,079
Ifthere is anything that

1131
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:52,712
you want to add to the termination
clause, go ahead.

1132
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:16,670
Just one question.

1133
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:19,103
Who has replaced me?

1134
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:21,741
Meghna Mathur.

1135
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:29,856
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
and my friends from the media.

1136
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:32,720
This is the moment we've
all been waiting for.

1137
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:35,156
Allow me to introduce to you,

1138
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:39,793
the sensational new face
of Panache.. Meghna Mathur.

1139
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:16,831
So glamorous.
So nervous. - I know.

1140
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,164
But he was so good..
- Excuse me.

1141
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:21,300
I am going to take her
away for a minute.

1142
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:23,174
Yes, sure. Sure.
- I'll just be back. - Yes, sure.

1143
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:25,179
Hi. - I want to introduce you to..

1144
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:29,675
Avantika..
- Yes. - Meet Meghna Mathur.

1145
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:31,242
This is Avantika Sarin.
- Oh hi.

1146
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,312
Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you Meghna.

1147
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,654
All the very best and
welcome to Panache.

1148
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:37,783
Thank you so much.

1149
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:42,195
In no time my dreams
turned into reality..

1150
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:44,232
..and they reached the sky.

1151
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:50,195
My new image as a super
model everywhere..

1152
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:52,331
..gave me a new high.

1153
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:59,377
I felt like the whole world
was interested in no one but me.

1154
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:02,212
I got lost in myself.

1155
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:06,221
Knowing what I wear..
what I eat.. what I think..

1156
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:09,348
possibly made people think
that they know me.

1157
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,217
I too was lost in myself.

1158
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:16,226
But l.. I just had one obsession.

1159
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:19,961
What would be my next
move to attain more success..

1160
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:25,263
What's so different in the soup?
- I have no idea.

1161
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,399
On the salad.

1162
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:28,238
Hey guys.
- Hi. - I am really sorry.

1163
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:29,368
Hi..
- Hi.

1164
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:33,640
You are so late, baby. You knew
this dinner was planned, right?

1165
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:36,617
Yes, but the campaign is about
to begin and you know how it is.

1166
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:40,250
I am sorry guys, I'll be right
back from the loo in five minutes.

1167
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:41,448
There she goes.

1168
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:42,751
Come, come. Sit, sit.

1169
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:43,985
We'll be here.

1170
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:58,998
Hi Shonali.

1171
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:12,412
Congratulations.. for Panache.

1172
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:20,352
Thanks, Shonali.

1173
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:24,291
Look, I hope you understand,
there's nothing personal.

1174
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:28,033
I didn't knowthat, its going to..
- Don't worry.

1175
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:30,700
Neither did l..

1176
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,303
It's this industry..

1177
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:37,812
..you never know when
the designs are outdated.

1178
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:48,353
No thanks.
- Smart, but be careful.

1179
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:51,484
You're still new.

1180
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:56,320
Everything feels good in the beginning..

1181
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:58,696
..the novelty eventually wears out.

1182
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:04,529
I can see it in your eyes.

1183
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:11,610
You will neither recognise
yourself nor anyone else.

1184
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:15,873
Be very careful.

1185
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:25,349
Thanks Shonali, but I recognise..

1186
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:30,422
Myself..

1187
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:32,490
and others as well.

1188
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:38,631
We'll see.

1189
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:55,613
It's really taking.. - As I told you,
Meghna, this is just the beginning.

1190
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:56,988
Yes..
- See, how things go.

1191
01:14:57,726 --> 01:14:58,784
Hi, Mr. Sarin..
- Nice to meet you.

1192
01:14:58,861 --> 01:14:59,987
Our new face of Panache,
Meghna Mathur.

1193
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:02,394
Meghna, that is Manohar Grover.
- Hello.

1194
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:03,726
Hi.
- Hello.

1195
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:05,130
Meet Mr. Stevens.
- Hello. - That's his beautiful wife.

1196
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,924
Hello. - Hi. - Mrs. Chang,
Meghna Mathur.

1197
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,060
Pleased to meet you.
- How are you doing?

1198
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:09,433
That's Mr. Harper.
- Hi. - Hello.

1199
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,063
Nice to meet you.
- He's a whiz kid.

1200
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:12,401
Oh!

1201
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:15,834
Cheers.

1202
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:18,971
Alright, then.

1203
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:25,079
Ifwe wait any longer..

1204
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:27,417
I'll have to head to
office from here only.

1205
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:31,421
Let's go.
- Yes. Come.

1206
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:34,156
No, that's it. You can stop here.

1207
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:35,924
Thank you.
- You are welcome.

1208
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:37,056
I'll get down.

1209
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:39,832
Thank you, good night.
- Good night, bye. - Bye.

1210
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:40,960
Bye.

1211
01:15:46,675 --> 01:15:47,869
I know.. I know.

1212
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:49,171
Even I know the time.

1213
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:53,470
Meghna.. - Look Manav not now,
I am really tired, okay?

1214
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:55,176
Meghna, I was worried.

1215
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:57,745
I tried calling you all night.

1216
01:15:58,186 --> 01:16:00,518
The phone was on silent
and in the bag.

1217
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:01,988
I don't know. Oh God, Manav..

1218
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:04,184
You knew I was with
Mr. Sarin at a party.

1219
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:06,620
Listen, but you could have
sent me a text message.

1220
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:09,987
I would have if I could have.
- You are right.

1221
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,724
Meghna, this is the fourth time.

1222
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:16,198
I am a model too. I know.

1223
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:20,136
Exactly! You're a model too,
so I thought you would understand..

1224
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,470
but obviously not.

1225
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:23,472
There were so many people at the party..

1226
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:25,877
Sarin was introducing me to
the media, so I was.. I couldn't.

1227
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,483
And you forgot that
someone's waiting for you..

1228
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:31,781
Manav, these are really important people.

1229
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:34,478
You won't understand the pressures.

1230
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:37,491
Really? So make me.
-How do l?

1231
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:39,923
You aren't in that league.
You are still struggling.

1232
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:51,563
Meghna, I am really happy
that you are in the big league.

1233
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:56,642
But have you thought about
the price you're paying for that?

1234
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:58,236
A lecture at four in the morning!

1235
01:16:58,513 --> 01:17:02,506
I am lecturing you because
not everybody can handle success.

1236
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:04,943
Is that so?

1237
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,578
Then tell me..

1238
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:09,522
..why are those
who preach about success..

1239
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:11,684
..only those who haven't tasted it yet?

1240
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:17,258
Because they don't run after it insanely.

1241
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:23,198
And what if Mr. Sarin were promoting you?

1242
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:26,165
Why would he?

1243
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:28,073
He's promoting you, isn't he?

1244
01:17:28,877 --> 01:17:30,538
Who knows what he is getting in return..

1245
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:44,553
I can't believe you just said that.
How typical, Manav.

1246
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,556
I don't know why,
but I thought you were different.

1247
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,964
I'd also thought the same about you.

1248
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:07,046
"Something is special, It's close to me, "

1249
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:13,713
"It's an unusual feeling. "

1250
01:18:14,923 --> 01:18:20,657
"This closeness has a distance. "

1251
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:26,961
"There is loneliness in the air. "

1252
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:33,265
"The love we have, the trust.. "

1253
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:39,781
"Maybe it was love. "

1254
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:46,617
"lt was blossom. "

1255
01:18:47,145 --> 01:18:50,581
"Maybe it was love. "

1256
01:18:52,383 --> 01:18:59,255
"Maybe it was love. "

1257
01:20:59,433 --> 01:21:04,234
For Meghna, I am the final word
Mr. Agarwal. Okay, bye.

1258
01:21:04,371 --> 01:21:07,568
So many sig natures, Anisha.
Is it necessary to read everything?

1259
01:21:07,975 --> 01:21:10,842
Just go through it once.
- No way.

1260
01:21:11,111 --> 01:21:13,909
No way. It's your agency's
contract. I trust you.

1261
01:21:14,047 --> 01:21:15,571
Where do I need to sign?

1262
01:21:15,849 --> 01:21:20,582
Okay. On all these pages, initials.

1263
01:21:20,921 --> 01:21:24,584
What?
- And here.. full signature.

1264
01:21:25,926 --> 01:21:28,258
It is a tough task ahead for you.
I am warning you.

1265
01:21:28,462 --> 01:21:30,521
What's the point?
I am the best.

1266
01:21:30,597 --> 01:21:31,928
And you know that.

1267
01:21:33,467 --> 01:21:34,525
Hello.
- Hi.

1268
01:21:35,402 --> 01:21:38,337
Oh hi. - Listen, I am sending you
a car, come over immediately.

1269
01:21:38,405 --> 01:21:39,463
Right now?

1270
01:21:39,539 --> 01:21:43,066
No questions do as I say.
- Okay.

1271
01:21:44,211 --> 01:21:46,543
Sarin?
- Yes.

1272
01:21:46,947 --> 01:21:48,005
Sign it later.

1273
01:21:49,016 --> 01:21:50,074
Thanks.

1274
01:21:56,156 --> 01:22:00,490
Come. Come..

1275
01:22:04,431 --> 01:22:05,489
This way.

1276
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,098
Come.

1277
01:22:16,443 --> 01:22:17,501
Surprise.

1278
01:22:23,383 --> 01:22:24,907
It's fabulous.

1279
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,649
I hope you like your new house.

1280
01:22:31,658 --> 01:22:32,920
It's yours.

1281
01:22:35,128 --> 01:22:36,186
I..

1282
01:22:42,002 --> 01:22:50,068
Mr. Sarin. I'll take it.

1283
01:22:51,278 --> 01:22:57,410
"Abode."

1284
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:10,687
"Abode."

1285
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:25,239
"Abode."

1286
01:23:25,445 --> 01:23:28,039
"l have got it."

1287
01:23:28,715 --> 01:23:32,048
"The goal of my destiny. "

1288
01:23:32,652 --> 01:23:35,587
"Why are you common?"

1289
01:23:36,123 --> 01:23:39,251
"l have no complaints. "

1290
01:23:39,326 --> 01:23:46,061
"A little intoxicated is my life. "

1291
01:23:47,401 --> 01:23:54,136
"A little intoxicated is my life. "

1292
01:23:54,207 --> 01:23:58,007
"This is my abode. "

1293
01:23:58,078 --> 01:24:01,605
"It's my youth. "

1294
01:24:01,681 --> 01:24:05,412
"l have no time for myself.. "

1295
01:24:05,485 --> 01:24:09,080
"l have no time for myself.. "

1296
01:25:42,249 --> 01:25:44,717
You should come to the Gurudwara
occasionally, it feels good.

1297
01:25:44,784 --> 01:25:46,251
Gurpreet?
- Kuldeep?

1298
01:25:46,853 --> 01:25:48,445
How are you?
-l' m fine.

1299
01:25:48,655 --> 01:25:50,646
Greetings.
- Greetings, dear.

1300
01:25:52,392 --> 01:25:55,384
What happened about the photographs
that Mrs. Sethi had sent?

1301
01:25:56,730 --> 01:25:58,664
No aunty, I don't want to
get married right now.

1302
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:00,461
Don't want to get married?

1303
01:26:01,735 --> 01:26:04,135
My daughter mentioned..

1304
01:26:04,204 --> 01:26:07,537
that these fashion designers
don't get married.

1305
01:26:07,807 --> 01:26:08,865
Is it true?

1306
01:26:09,409 --> 01:26:12,139
So are you also..

1307
01:26:13,813 --> 01:26:16,145
Aunt, these days, people
say just about anything.

1308
01:26:17,217 --> 01:26:19,481
How is Dolly, your elder daughter?

1309
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:21,744
The one that got married in London.

1310
01:26:22,822 --> 01:26:24,483
I heard she is divorced..

1311
01:26:24,691 --> 01:26:26,352
..and now she's living with you.

1312
01:26:27,627 --> 01:26:28,685
Is it true?

1313
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:32,154
Come on, let's go.

1314
01:26:34,367 --> 01:26:38,633
You'll run out of answers
but their questions won't stop.

1315
01:26:39,906 --> 01:26:41,168
Mom..
- Yes..

1316
01:26:41,241 --> 01:26:42,299
It's your life, your decision.

1317
01:26:42,842 --> 01:26:43,900
Mom?

1318
01:26:45,245 --> 01:26:47,907
Rahul, I'm nervous.

1319
01:26:48,915 --> 01:26:52,180
I never thought I'd be the show
stopper for such a big show.

1320
01:26:53,587 --> 01:26:55,316
And today thanks to you..
-Enough now.

1321
01:26:55,655 --> 01:26:57,714
Now don't get into your
teenage drama queen mode..

1322
01:26:57,924 --> 01:26:59,721
You verywell knowthat you can do it..

1323
01:26:59,793 --> 01:27:00,851
..oryou wouldn't have agreed.

1324
01:27:01,728 --> 01:27:03,923
Rahul.. you know..

1325
01:27:04,731 --> 01:27:08,326
I agreed because
I can never say no to you.

1326
01:27:08,468 --> 01:27:09,935
Thank you for that.

1327
01:27:11,338 --> 01:27:15,331
You look lovely. - Thank you. - Okay?
And you rock! - Thank you.

1328
01:27:16,943 --> 01:27:18,342
Ria! How are you doing here?

1329
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:50,633
Ladies and Gentlemen,
please welcome Rahul Arora.

1330
01:28:50,770 --> 01:28:54,297
Who has brought us
the lovely brand La Perla!

1331
01:29:06,586 --> 01:29:07,985
It was very funny.

1332
01:29:10,523 --> 01:29:12,388
You're back.
- Yes.

1333
01:29:12,726 --> 01:29:14,717
So, what did you ask of Him?

1334
01:29:14,994 --> 01:29:17,053
I wasn't here to ask.
I came to thank Him.

1335
01:29:19,799 --> 01:29:22,859
Janet, yesterday, backstage
you told me something.

1336
01:29:23,536 --> 01:29:24,594
Did you really mean it?

1337
01:29:25,405 --> 01:29:26,463
What?

1338
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:29,808
That you can never say no to me.

1339
01:29:29,876 --> 01:29:31,935
Of course Rahul,
you know that.

1340
01:29:36,349 --> 01:29:40,342
Janet Sequeira.
- Yes. - Will you marry me?

1341
01:29:45,692 --> 01:29:48,559
You are such an idiot.
I thought you were serious.

1342
01:29:48,628 --> 01:29:52,689
I am. I am serious.

1343
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:56,692
Janet, will you marry me?

1344
01:30:02,108 --> 01:30:05,373
Listen, I don't know
whether it's right or wrong.

1345
01:30:06,446 --> 01:30:07,913
But I do know this..

1346
01:30:08,114 --> 01:30:09,638
..if anyone can understand me..

1347
01:30:11,384 --> 01:30:12,442
..it's only you.

1348
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:19,585
What about your boyfriend?

1349
01:30:21,728 --> 01:30:22,990
I have spoken to him.

1350
01:30:26,065 --> 01:30:27,862
When you can't come
out with the truth..

1351
01:30:29,002 --> 01:30:30,594
..it's time to live a lie.

1352
01:30:33,673 --> 01:30:36,005
There are a lot of people
who live like us.

1353
01:30:37,544 --> 01:30:38,738
So shall we.

1354
01:30:41,147 --> 01:30:42,409
And as they say..

1355
01:30:42,949 --> 01:30:46,407
it is difficult to find
a good friend in a husband.

1356
01:30:47,153 --> 01:30:50,611
But you will surely find
a good husband in a good friend.

1357
01:30:54,828 --> 01:30:55,886
So?

1358
01:31:00,099 --> 01:31:01,157
You know my answer.

1359
01:31:06,105 --> 01:31:07,766
You know I can never say no to you.

1360
01:31:09,108 --> 01:31:11,770
Oh God, you scared me.

1361
01:31:21,454 --> 01:31:22,580
How sweet?

1362
01:31:24,991 --> 01:31:27,459
See you. Let's go.
- Let's go. - Please, come.

1363
01:31:28,528 --> 01:31:30,996
Hi Leena.
- Hi Leena. - Hi!

1364
01:31:31,064 --> 01:31:33,794
Hi Meghna.
- Hi, Mr. Sarin.

1365
01:31:33,933 --> 01:31:35,798
Hello Meghna.
- Hi.

1366
01:31:36,536 --> 01:31:38,800
So, everyone is talking about you.

1367
01:31:40,206 --> 01:31:42,470
Don't worry, they're
saying good things.

1368
01:31:45,211 --> 01:31:47,475
Abhi is taking good
care of you, isn't he?

1369
01:31:48,748 --> 01:31:51,740
After all, you are
so important to Panache.

1370
01:31:53,887 --> 01:31:57,482
Of course.
Bye. - Bye.

1371
01:31:57,557 --> 01:31:59,149
See you, Meghna.
- Bye.

1372
01:31:59,492 --> 01:32:00,550
Bye.

1373
01:32:01,761 --> 01:32:02,819
What was that?

1374
01:32:05,231 --> 01:32:06,493
That it. For you.

1375
01:32:14,507 --> 01:32:17,567
Attention. Attention, please.

1376
01:32:19,913 --> 01:32:21,107
Attention, please.

1377
01:32:21,781 --> 01:32:24,511
Ladies and gentlemen,
attention, please.

1378
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,250
I.. I want to raise a toast.

1379
01:32:31,791 --> 01:32:33,520
Today is Rahul's wedding..

1380
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:36,125
..and I'm very happy.

1381
01:32:39,866 --> 01:32:45,736
I want to congratulate Rahul
and his beautiful wife.

1382
01:32:45,805 --> 01:32:46,931
Thank you.

1383
01:32:47,941 --> 01:32:54,744
Hi wife.. wife..
- Janet.

1384
01:32:55,281 --> 01:32:58,682
Janet.. Janet, right.

1385
01:33:00,286 --> 01:33:03,619
Janet is a beautiful girl
and Rahul is a great guy.

1386
01:33:03,690 --> 01:33:06,955
Cheers, guys!
- Cheers!

1387
01:33:11,898 --> 01:33:13,889
Cheers!

1388
01:33:26,713 --> 01:33:29,773
Kartik, this is the kind
of look I want, okay?

1389
01:33:30,583 --> 01:33:33,848
Vinay, you will get any look you want,
but please call your model.

1390
01:33:34,587 --> 01:33:35,986
Come on, guys. I am ready.

1391
01:33:36,122 --> 01:33:38,920
Does anyone want to shoot or not?
- Yes, of course.

1392
01:33:40,126 --> 01:33:41,593
Vinay.
- Yes.

1393
01:33:42,328 --> 01:33:44,660
I thought of holding
the drape like this.

1394
01:33:45,798 --> 01:33:48,596
I know you are very particular
about your drapes.

1395
01:33:49,135 --> 01:33:52,263
Ifyou don't like it we can change it.

1396
01:33:52,338 --> 01:33:55,603
No. it is absolutely fine. You are looking
gorgeous. - Thanks.

1397
01:33:55,675 --> 01:33:58,075
Don't be silly.
- I thought so.

1398
01:34:00,613 --> 01:34:01,944
What are you standing here for!

1399
01:34:02,015 --> 01:34:04,279
Go and get the next thing
ready duffer. - Sir.. - Go!

1400
01:34:04,817 --> 01:34:06,341
Come on, Vinay, let's hurry up.

1401
01:34:06,619 --> 01:34:08,143
It's been two hours and
we haven't taken a single shot.

1402
01:34:09,689 --> 01:34:11,623
Meghna.. darling are you ready?

1403
01:34:11,691 --> 01:34:13,215
Why are you getting
so hyper, Kartik?

1404
01:34:13,693 --> 01:34:15,684
Anyway, what do you have to do?

1405
01:34:16,362 --> 01:34:18,626
Except change the background colours.

1406
01:34:22,635 --> 01:34:26,036
Oh God. Just ignore her, okay?

1407
01:34:26,172 --> 01:34:27,833
Okay guys, come on guys.

1408
01:34:28,174 --> 01:34:29,368
Come on, let's get ready.

1409
01:34:33,246 --> 01:34:34,645
Anybody for some more drinks?

1410
01:34:35,114 --> 01:34:36,638
I think that's enough, baby.

1411
01:34:36,716 --> 01:34:37,774
Really?
- Yes.

1412
01:34:48,261 --> 01:34:51,924
Shona..
- Yes. - Do you love me?

1413
01:34:52,331 --> 01:34:54,856
Yes, I love you.
- How much?

1414
01:34:55,134 --> 01:34:57,068
A lot..
- Really?

1415
01:34:58,071 --> 01:34:59,197
She loves me.

1416
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:01,998
Drink this.

1417
01:35:03,876 --> 01:35:08,279
Come on, drink it.
Come on, Shona.

1418
01:35:08,748 --> 01:35:09,806
Are you joking?

1419
01:35:12,018 --> 01:35:14,350
I am serious, Shona.
Come on. Come on.

1420
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:16,217
Listen.. Come on.
- Please, pal.

1421
01:35:18,224 --> 01:35:22,092
She loves me. Don't you, baby?
Come on now, drink it.

1422
01:35:22,161 --> 01:35:24,356
Don't be shy. Drink it.

1423
01:35:24,897 --> 01:35:27,695
Drink it, Shona. Come on. Drink it.

1424
01:35:29,302 --> 01:35:30,360
Get lost from here!

1425
01:35:39,245 --> 01:35:41,713
Hey!
- Don't touch me, you fool!

1426
01:35:41,781 --> 01:35:44,375
Stop being a lousy woman!
I was joking! - You were joking!

1427
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:45,712
You insult me in front of your..

1428
01:35:45,785 --> 01:35:47,309
..friends and then say you were joking.

1429
01:35:47,386 --> 01:35:48,444
You fool!

1430
01:35:48,521 --> 01:35:51,046
Who funds your expenses?
Who pays all your bills?

1431
01:35:51,190 --> 01:35:52,384
Do your friends know about this?

1432
01:35:52,458 --> 01:35:53,720
Have you told them?

1433
01:35:53,793 --> 01:35:55,317
Or should I tell them?
-Listen man!

1434
01:35:55,928 --> 01:35:59,125
You don't do me any favour
by funding my expenses.

1435
01:35:59,398 --> 01:36:01,389
Who gets you your dope?

1436
01:36:01,868 --> 01:36:02,926
I do.

1437
01:36:03,136 --> 01:36:05,263
Who handles your craziness?

1438
01:36:06,005 --> 01:36:07,063
I do!

1439
01:36:07,473 --> 01:36:09,941
You are a crazy woman,
you know that?

1440
01:36:10,476 --> 01:36:11,875
A crazy woman.

1441
01:36:12,278 --> 01:36:14,746
Don't call me crazy, you fool!

1442
01:36:15,148 --> 01:36:16,206
Get lost!

1443
01:36:38,437 --> 01:36:39,768
What rubbish,
I don't need a Bollywood..

1444
01:36:39,839 --> 01:36:42,364
..star when I have you, come on.

1445
01:36:42,775 --> 01:36:44,766
This is your place.
Make yourself comfortable here.

1446
01:36:44,844 --> 01:36:46,778
Okay?
- Thanks Vinay.

1447
01:36:46,846 --> 01:36:49,781
And..
- Oh. - Who has done this?

1448
01:36:49,849 --> 01:36:52,784
Sorry, dear. Yes, I've organized
some wine for you, I'll just check.

1449
01:36:52,852 --> 01:36:53,910
Yes? Alright, thanks.

1450
01:36:53,986 --> 01:36:56,784
Salim, leave everything right now
and attend to Meghna.

1451
01:36:56,856 --> 01:36:57,914
Come on, fast.

1452
01:36:57,990 --> 01:36:59,048
Shonali.. you first change.
- Yes.

1453
01:36:59,125 --> 01:37:00,183
Kuki..
- Hi.

1454
01:37:00,993 --> 01:37:03,257
I told you I want more
options for earrings, right?

1455
01:37:03,863 --> 01:37:05,194
I won't wear such tacky earrings.

1456
01:37:05,264 --> 01:37:07,789
Meghna, everyone has the same look.

1457
01:37:07,867 --> 01:37:09,926
All the models are wearing
the same earrings.

1458
01:37:10,536 --> 01:37:14,870
So.. I am the show stopper tonight.

1459
01:37:18,477 --> 01:37:20,342
Make it happen..
- Fine.

1460
01:37:23,816 --> 01:37:25,875
Yes, thank you.

1461
01:39:31,417 --> 01:39:32,679
Move.. move.. please move aside.

1462
01:39:32,752 --> 01:39:34,879
Shonali is here, help her.
Please, get me a stole. Quickly.

1463
01:39:35,888 --> 01:39:37,685
Please, get me a stole, someone.

1464
01:39:37,757 --> 01:39:40,282
Swati, will you please get me a stole?
Right now!

1465
01:39:42,028 --> 01:39:43,222
Come Shonali, sit. Sit.

1466
01:39:43,296 --> 01:39:45,025
What's wrong with her?

1467
01:39:46,899 --> 01:39:50,300
Girls, will you please go
for your finale? Line up, please.

1468
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:52,934
Calm down Shonali. Calm down.

1469
01:39:53,366 --> 01:39:55,630
Stop the media from coming inside!

1470
01:39:56,035 --> 01:39:57,093
Just relax.

1471
01:39:58,304 --> 01:40:00,101
Oh God..
- Calm down, Shonali.

1472
01:40:00,172 --> 01:40:02,037
Shonali, please. Just relax.

1473
01:40:02,375 --> 01:40:05,572
Itwill be okay. Just calm down.

1474
01:40:12,518 --> 01:40:13,576
It has to be my rivals.

1475
01:40:13,652 --> 01:40:15,176
They are trying to sabotage my show.

1476
01:40:15,721 --> 01:40:17,188
This is not happening to me.

1477
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:19,387
No. No. No media bites.

1478
01:40:19,725 --> 01:40:21,989
No, please.

1479
01:40:22,128 --> 01:40:24,995
I'm not in a frame of mind to comment.

1480
01:40:25,131 --> 01:40:26,996
Spare me the horror.

1481
01:40:27,066 --> 01:40:29,000
Please, no. no.

1482
01:40:29,068 --> 01:40:31,127
The media should
show some restraint.

1483
01:40:32,071 --> 01:40:33,538
Shonali is really disturbed.

1484
01:40:33,606 --> 01:40:35,005
No, I don't think Shonali Gujral..

1485
01:40:35,074 --> 01:40:37,008
..will do something like this for publicity.

1486
01:40:37,076 --> 01:40:39,544
It's very unfortunate,
but it is only an accident.

1487
01:40:39,612 --> 01:40:42,080
There is no need to hype it
and create an issue of it.

1488
01:40:42,148 --> 01:40:45,345
Down with fashion shows!
Don't ruin our culture!

1489
01:40:45,418 --> 01:40:47,352
As far as Vinay Khosla's
show is concerned..

1490
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:51,083
whether this was an
accident or publicity stunt..

1491
01:40:51,157 --> 01:40:52,624
Only Shonali can confirm.

1492
01:40:53,092 --> 01:40:56,220
You have just seen what
Meghna Mathur had to say.

1493
01:40:56,295 --> 01:40:57,557
She herself is a model
the same Meghna Mathur,

1494
01:40:57,630 --> 01:41:00,030
who is the brand
ambassador of Panache.

1495
01:41:00,099 --> 01:41:02,567
Could this be a personal conflict?
Or anything else?

1496
01:41:02,635 --> 01:41:05,035
Let's see again, what
Meghna Mathur has to say..

1497
01:41:05,104 --> 01:41:08,437
..about her rival Shonali Gujral.

1498
01:41:08,507 --> 01:41:12,034
Whether this was an
accident or publicity stunt..

1499
01:41:12,178 --> 01:41:15,705
Only Shonali can confirm.

1500
01:41:15,781 --> 01:41:19,182
Only Shonali can confirm.

1501
01:42:28,387 --> 01:42:30,184
Did you see the story about Shonali on TV?

1502
01:42:31,657 --> 01:42:35,184
Don't know for how long
she will have to stay there.

1503
01:42:35,794 --> 01:42:37,591
Really sad.
- Yes.

1504
01:42:40,533 --> 01:42:43,127
Janet, have you given it a thought?

1505
01:42:44,603 --> 01:42:46,332
Rahul, I am still thinking.

1506
01:42:47,473 --> 01:42:50,271
To adopt a child considering our situation?

1507
01:42:50,876 --> 01:42:52,138
Janet, but..

1508
01:42:52,344 --> 01:42:54,812
Yes, Rahul.
It's a huge responsibility.

1509
01:42:55,681 --> 01:42:57,273
I promise, I'll think it over.

1510
01:42:59,351 --> 01:43:00,750
Take your time.
- Yes.

1511
01:43:02,354 --> 01:43:03,412
How is Ashish doing?

1512
01:43:07,226 --> 01:43:08,284
Rocking.

1513
01:43:08,494 --> 01:43:09,688
He's gone off to Chennai..

1514
01:43:10,696 --> 01:43:12,823
..to do a show with Manish.
- Lovely.

1515
01:43:18,837 --> 01:43:20,828
Your drink.
- Thank you.

1516
01:43:26,178 --> 01:43:28,373
Why can't you come with me
on this three city tour?

1517
01:43:30,449 --> 01:43:32,849
Abhi, after all,
it is a Panache event.

1518
01:43:33,319 --> 01:43:34,581
I mean, we will be together too.

1519
01:43:34,653 --> 01:43:36,177
What's wrong with you, Meghna?

1520
01:43:37,256 --> 01:43:38,314
You know it is not possible.

1521
01:43:39,258 --> 01:43:40,657
Where did this come from?

1522
01:43:45,464 --> 01:43:46,658
There's something I want to tell you.

1523
01:43:47,733 --> 01:43:48,791
Go on..

1524
01:43:52,271 --> 01:43:56,207
I am pregnant.
- That's all.

1525
01:43:58,277 --> 01:44:00,609
Not to worry, it can be handled.

1526
01:44:08,287 --> 01:44:09,618
And what if I tell you..

1527
01:44:12,224 --> 01:44:13,350
..that I want to keep the baby.

1528
01:44:14,226 --> 01:44:16,888
Sure.. I am okay with it.

1529
01:44:20,299 --> 01:44:21,357
I don't have a problem..

1530
01:44:22,501 --> 01:44:24,366
..but Anisha might have a problem.

1531
01:44:25,704 --> 01:44:27,228
You have signed a contract.

1532
01:44:33,312 --> 01:44:35,439
Abhi, at times you are really funny.

1533
01:44:36,382 --> 01:44:37,440
I was just kidding..

1534
01:44:38,651 --> 01:44:40,380
..and you took it seriously.

1535
01:44:43,389 --> 01:44:45,380
I am a really successful model.

1536
01:44:47,593 --> 01:44:48,924
I won't ruin my career.

1537
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:56,465
Come, I'll make you another drink.

1538
01:45:05,878 --> 01:45:08,608
Yes, my love.
I'm on my way home.

1539
01:45:09,948 --> 01:45:11,609
No. I dined with the client.

1540
01:45:13,485 --> 01:45:14,611
Have the children slept?

1541
01:45:16,555 --> 01:45:18,420
Yes, see you soon.

1542
01:45:22,828 --> 01:45:25,296
Page 20, clause 22 A.

1543
01:45:26,365 --> 01:45:28,697
We will get twenty percent
of your earnings.

1544
01:45:31,036 --> 01:45:32,560
Clause 31 C.

1545
01:45:34,373 --> 01:45:37,638
You can't do any endorsement
or make an appearance..

1546
01:45:37,710 --> 01:45:40,975
..without our permission.

1547
01:45:42,514 --> 01:45:44,778
And finally Clause 36.

1548
01:45:45,517 --> 01:45:49,851
Officially you can neither get married..

1549
01:45:51,390 --> 01:45:53,449
..nor get pregnant.

1550
01:45:54,393 --> 01:45:55,724
till the contract is valid.

1551
01:46:02,935 --> 01:46:05,733
You know what.. I don't care!

1552
01:46:07,740 --> 01:46:08,934
Whom are you calling?

1553
01:46:10,609 --> 01:46:11,667
Sarin?

1554
01:46:12,678 --> 01:46:13,872
It is no use, my dear.

1555
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:17,342
Sarin put in these clauses in
the contract himself.

1556
01:46:40,038 --> 01:46:41,369
Are you okay?

1557
01:46:47,446 --> 01:46:49,778
I am fine.

1558
01:46:54,453 --> 01:46:59,857
I went back to being a middle
class girl for a while.

1559
01:47:06,598 --> 01:47:07,656
But I am fine.

1560
01:47:10,869 --> 01:47:11,927
I am fine.

1561
01:47:19,077 --> 01:47:20,408
I am fine.

1562
01:48:26,678 --> 01:48:28,737
Whose pregnancy do you
want to get terminated?

1563
01:48:29,214 --> 01:48:30,476
Mine.

1564
01:48:30,549 --> 01:48:32,073
Are you married?
- No. - Okay.

1565
01:48:33,018 --> 01:48:36,010
Just fill up this form.
- Can I borrow your pen?

1566
01:49:03,649 --> 01:49:05,116
Stop! Stop!

1567
01:49:09,788 --> 01:49:11,050
Madam, you are driving
without the seat belt.

1568
01:49:11,857 --> 01:49:12,915
License?

1569
01:49:15,928 --> 01:49:18,123
Listen, I don't have much time, so..

1570
01:49:18,196 --> 01:49:19,527
Alright. Take the car aside.

1571
01:49:19,665 --> 01:49:21,189
Sir, license.

1572
01:49:25,604 --> 01:49:27,003
Surekha, take the test.

1573
01:49:28,607 --> 01:49:30,074
I am not going to take that dirty test, okay?

1574
01:49:30,142 --> 01:49:31,666
Who knows how many people
have put it in their mouth.

1575
01:49:31,743 --> 01:49:32,801
Listen madam.

1576
01:49:32,878 --> 01:49:35,745
It doesn't matter whether you are
a model, an actor or anybody else..

1577
01:49:36,014 --> 01:49:37,072
I don't care.

1578
01:49:37,616 --> 01:49:39,208
Surekha, take the test.

1579
01:49:54,633 --> 01:49:58,626
Our daughter has done us proud.

1580
01:49:58,704 --> 01:50:01,571
The one who climbed
the stairs of success so soon.

1581
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:02,698
Why are you crying?

1582
01:50:02,774 --> 01:50:06,642
Look, your daughter is now a super model.

1583
01:50:07,713 --> 01:50:13,583
Now our neighbours will come
with flowers, to a proud mother.

1584
01:50:16,788 --> 01:50:20,724
Meghna, your reckless behaviour is
not only damaging your reputation..

1585
01:50:20,993 --> 01:50:22,585
..but Panache's too.

1586
01:50:23,595 --> 01:50:24,721
I know you are upset.

1587
01:50:25,130 --> 01:50:28,725
But learn to keep your personal life
apart from your professional life.

1588
01:50:32,938 --> 01:50:33,996
Really?

1589
01:50:37,075 --> 01:50:38,133
Tell me something, Abhi.

1590
01:50:39,945 --> 01:50:41,003
What about our relationship..

1591
01:50:43,682 --> 01:50:45,081
..is it personal or professional?

1592
01:50:51,623 --> 01:50:55,218
Don't worry.
You don't have to answer that.

1593
01:50:59,765 --> 01:51:01,960
It is time to get truly
professional Mr. Sarin.

1594
01:51:28,727 --> 01:51:32,663
Yes.. - Had you been to his last season?
- No, I haven't, but l..

1595
01:51:32,731 --> 01:51:34,665
I am telling you, the food should..

1596
01:51:34,733 --> 01:51:37,327
No thank you.
- Yes, she is very charming.

1597
01:51:37,402 --> 01:51:39,666
I will.
- Cheers.

1598
01:51:41,807 --> 01:51:42,865
That's not fair.

1599
01:51:43,341 --> 01:51:45,673
Lovely!
- Exactly.

1600
01:51:45,744 --> 01:51:47,678
Hey, I'll be right back.
- Sure.

1601
01:51:47,746 --> 01:51:51,011
How I managed to put this show together.

1602
01:51:51,083 --> 01:51:54,075
It was hell.. - Whatever,
third big launch of the year.

1603
01:51:54,152 --> 01:51:55,210
Thank you very much.

1604
01:51:55,287 --> 01:51:56,811
Tony..
- Hi.

1605
01:51:58,824 --> 01:51:59,882
Congratulations.

1606
01:51:59,958 --> 01:52:01,357
I am so sorry I came late.

1607
01:52:01,426 --> 01:52:02,950
No, it's alright. You made it at least.

1608
01:52:03,028 --> 01:52:04,689
Cheers.
- Bye.

1609
01:52:04,763 --> 01:52:05,821
Excuse me.
- Yes. - See you.

1610
01:52:05,897 --> 01:52:06,955
Johnny, hi.

1611
01:52:09,101 --> 01:52:12,832
Hi Meghna.
- Abhi..

1612
01:52:15,774 --> 01:52:17,969
I think you have taken
my words too seriously.

1613
01:52:18,977 --> 01:52:20,706
You have become so professional..

1614
01:52:20,779 --> 01:52:22,041
..that you are uneasy greeting me.

1615
01:52:22,114 --> 01:52:24,708
Behave yourself. You are drunk.

1616
01:52:24,783 --> 01:52:25,841
I am drunk?

1617
01:52:29,321 --> 01:52:36,193
Hello, Meghna.
- Mrs. Sarin.

1618
01:52:36,995 --> 01:52:38,326
So, how are you now?

1619
01:52:38,997 --> 01:52:41,329
I saw all that drama on television.

1620
01:52:41,399 --> 01:52:44,334
What happened?
You look so stressed out.

1621
01:52:47,739 --> 01:52:48,865
Didn't you tell her?

1622
01:52:50,742 --> 01:52:54,405
Actually, I wasn't well.
I was in a clinic.

1623
01:52:56,214 --> 01:52:57,340
I had an abortion.

1624
01:53:01,353 --> 01:53:03,344
Abhi will give you the details.

1625
01:53:05,757 --> 01:53:08,089
After all.. he paid the bills.

1626
01:53:17,769 --> 01:53:19,896
Oh! She got offended.

1627
01:53:31,783 --> 01:53:33,774
I'm telling you again Meghna,
it's still not too late.

1628
01:53:34,319 --> 01:53:36,378
Avantika is very upset..

1629
01:53:36,855 --> 01:53:38,186
..but I think we can handle it.

1630
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:41,857
Just meet her once and apologise.

1631
01:53:42,127 --> 01:53:44,322
If she forgives you,
everything will be sorted.

1632
01:53:44,396 --> 01:53:45,454
I should apologise to her?

1633
01:53:46,932 --> 01:53:47,990
Are you kidding me?

1634
01:53:49,868 --> 01:53:51,335
Who is she, Anisha?

1635
01:53:52,537 --> 01:53:54,869
Just some lousy trophy wife..

1636
01:53:56,875 --> 01:53:58,001
I don't need her.

1637
01:53:58,810 --> 01:54:01,802
Of course, you need her, Meghna.

1638
01:54:02,414 --> 01:54:04,882
You're in this position due to Panache.

1639
01:54:04,950 --> 01:54:08,147
You are signing brands courtesy of Panache.
You need them!

1640
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:09,414
Wrong, Anisha.

1641
01:54:11,089 --> 01:54:13,353
I am the freaking face of Panache.

1642
01:54:15,427 --> 01:54:19,955
I don't need Panache,
Panache needs me. Okay?

1643
01:54:26,104 --> 01:54:27,162
Anything else?

1644
01:55:03,541 --> 01:55:05,133
Yes. - What the hell is going on, Anisha?

1645
01:55:05,610 --> 01:55:07,874
Where the hell have you been?
- Shut up!

1646
01:55:08,079 --> 01:55:09,137
I just read the paper.

1647
01:55:10,148 --> 01:55:11,206
Come on, Meghna.

1648
01:55:11,616 --> 01:55:13,015
This had to happen.

1649
01:55:13,285 --> 01:55:14,547
I told you so.

1650
01:55:15,086 --> 01:55:16,348
Oh, cut the crap, Anisha.

1651
01:55:17,088 --> 01:55:19,022
Gauri Anand is from your agency.

1652
01:55:19,090 --> 01:55:21,957
I've been replaced.

1653
01:55:22,627 --> 01:55:23,889
Don't be such a lousy woman.

1654
01:55:23,962 --> 01:55:26,021
There's no need to get personal, Meghna.

1655
01:55:26,231 --> 01:55:29,029
Personal? I can't believe you did this to me.

1656
01:55:30,168 --> 01:55:31,567
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1657
01:55:33,371 --> 01:55:36,499
When we replaced Shonali..

1658
01:55:37,108 --> 01:55:38,905
..you didn't ask me this.

1659
01:55:39,978 --> 01:55:41,036
I really think you should..

1660
01:55:56,061 --> 01:55:57,926
The sound of a shattered
dream never hurts..

1661
01:55:57,996 --> 01:55:59,987
..as much as it's lasting echo.

1662
01:56:01,132 --> 01:56:03,930
My career started falling
like a pack of cards..

1663
01:56:04,002 --> 01:56:06,061
..and I stood there,
a mere spectator.

1664
01:56:06,604 --> 01:56:08,936
Everything changed..
home, relationships..

1665
01:56:09,007 --> 01:56:10,474
..and along with them I changed too.

1666
01:56:11,409 --> 01:56:14,003
Commitments, sincerity, professionalism..

1667
01:56:14,546 --> 01:56:17,344
I ran away from all of them..

1668
01:56:17,415 --> 01:56:20,942
..and reached a place so loud..

1669
01:56:21,019 --> 01:56:24,011
..that I couldn't even hear myself.

1670
01:56:25,357 --> 01:56:30,090
What I was doing, why I was doing it..
I had no clue at all.

1671
01:56:31,162 --> 01:56:35,565
Shonali was right,
I couldn't even recognize myself.

1672
01:56:44,042 --> 01:56:45,134
Go easy, Meghna.

1673
01:56:45,477 --> 01:56:46,967
You've had a lot to drink.

1674
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:49,970
You're saying that, Janet!

1675
01:56:53,084 --> 01:56:55,314
Look, I don't know how to lecture.

1676
01:56:55,653 --> 01:56:58,554
But I can say this much,
you're ruining yourself.

1677
01:56:58,990 --> 01:57:00,048
You are right.

1678
01:57:00,125 --> 01:57:03,390
You don't know how to lecture,
so please don't try.

1679
01:57:05,063 --> 01:57:08,999
Meghna, everyone I meet is
talking about your arrogance.

1680
01:57:10,201 --> 01:57:12,669
It is not arrogance,
baby. It is attitude.

1681
01:57:13,138 --> 01:57:15,663
It's important to have an
attitude to be successful.

1682
01:57:15,740 --> 01:57:17,105
Okay?
- Oh, really?

1683
01:57:17,275 --> 01:57:19,106
What about unprofessionalism?

1684
01:57:19,444 --> 01:57:21,275
Is that necessary too?

1685
01:57:23,181 --> 01:57:24,671
Listen, if you continue to..

1686
01:57:24,749 --> 01:57:26,273
..behave like this no one
will want to work with you.

1687
01:57:27,652 --> 01:57:29,017
Unprofessional?

1688
01:57:31,756 --> 01:57:35,021
Did you just call me
unprofessional, Janet?

1689
01:57:37,095 --> 01:57:39,325
What do you know
about professionalism?

1690
01:57:41,032 --> 01:57:44,433
You don't become a model by doing
a couple of small assignments.

1691
01:57:48,039 --> 01:57:51,702
Listen.. I know I didn't make it big.

1692
01:57:52,043 --> 01:57:55,240
But I have spent more time in this industry.

1693
01:57:57,515 --> 01:58:00,643
I know why your reputation is getting ruined.

1694
01:58:01,386 --> 01:58:03,047
That's why l' m telling you..

1695
01:58:03,121 --> 01:58:05,385
..straighten up before everything crumbles.

1696
01:58:09,394 --> 01:58:10,452
Straighten up?

1697
01:58:12,063 --> 01:58:13,121
How?

1698
01:58:14,566 --> 01:58:17,057
Should I beg Sarin or Anisha?

1699
01:58:19,471 --> 01:58:21,166
I knowwhat I can do.

1700
01:58:22,574 --> 01:58:26,135
I should marry a rich gay designer like you.

1701
01:58:27,445 --> 01:58:28,503
How about that?

1702
01:58:30,782 --> 01:58:35,151
Leave. Just leave.

1703
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:57,704
Hey.
- Hi babes. Where are you?

1704
01:58:57,775 --> 01:58:59,106
We all are waiting for you.

1705
01:58:59,177 --> 01:59:00,439
Come to Dhiren's party fast now.

1706
01:59:00,512 --> 01:59:02,446
Yes, I'll be there.

1707
01:59:02,514 --> 01:59:04,106
Give me 20 minutes.
- Okay.

1708
01:59:05,450 --> 01:59:10,285
"Charm, "

1709
01:59:14,125 --> 01:59:19,188
"Charm, "

1710
01:59:21,633 --> 01:59:25,729
"It's the charm of the body. "

1711
01:59:25,803 --> 01:59:28,135
"It's the charm of the body. "

1712
01:59:28,206 --> 01:59:30,333
"It's the ladder to success. "

1713
01:59:34,812 --> 01:59:36,643
"Charm, "

1714
01:59:37,148 --> 01:59:41,209
"It's the charm of fashion. "

1715
01:59:41,286 --> 01:59:47,816
"It's intoxicating. "

1716
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:57,568
"Charm, It's the charm of the body, "

1717
01:59:58,436 --> 02:00:05,239
"Here love is on fire. "

1718
02:00:05,310 --> 02:00:11,840
"Charm, "

1719
02:00:11,916 --> 02:00:16,182
"Charm, It's the charm of fashion, "

1720
02:00:16,254 --> 02:00:20,384
"Charm, "

1721
02:00:20,458 --> 02:00:24,622
"It's the charm of fashion. "

1722
02:00:55,693 --> 02:00:59,686
"lt keeps asking. It's amazing. "

1723
02:00:59,897 --> 02:01:04,231
"No one could undo it. "

1724
02:01:04,302 --> 02:01:08,898
"This charm. Heavens bow to the earth. "

1725
02:01:12,810 --> 02:01:17,247
"This charm. "

1726
02:01:21,486 --> 02:01:25,513
"lt sparks fire in the heart "

1727
02:01:26,257 --> 02:01:30,318
"This charm. "

1728
02:01:30,461 --> 02:01:34,591
"It's the charm of fashion. "

1729
02:01:34,866 --> 02:01:39,269
"This charm. It's the charm of fashion. "

1730
02:01:39,337 --> 02:01:43,467
"Charm, "

1731
02:06:32,029 --> 02:06:33,087
Meghna..

1732
02:06:39,170 --> 02:06:40,228
Dear..

1733
02:06:58,255 --> 02:07:00,587
We become totally isolated..

1734
02:07:00,658 --> 02:07:03,320
..when we lose our own company.

1735
02:07:04,929 --> 02:07:06,590
I came back home to Chandigarh..

1736
02:07:06,664 --> 02:07:09,224
..but I could never be myself.

1737
02:07:10,901 --> 02:07:12,732
Leaving all my relationships behind..

1738
02:07:13,170 --> 02:07:15,661
I descended into my inner darkness.

1739
02:07:17,041 --> 02:07:20,101
I neither felt happy nor sad.

1740
02:07:25,116 --> 02:07:27,607
The psychiatrist advised..

1741
02:07:27,685 --> 02:07:30,620
..that nothing is possible until..

1742
02:07:30,688 --> 02:07:36,627
I rediscover myself and
my inner self confidence.

1743
02:07:38,262 --> 02:07:41,629
But as easy as it is to lose oneself..

1744
02:07:41,699 --> 02:07:44,634
..it is even more difficult to forgive oneself..

1745
02:07:44,702 --> 02:07:47,694
..to find oneself again.

1746
02:07:49,940 --> 02:07:51,703
Have you heard anything about Shonali?

1747
02:07:53,277 --> 02:07:55,211
I heard that she's run away from rehab.

1748
02:07:56,647 --> 02:07:57,739
No one knows her whereabouts.

1749
02:07:58,649 --> 02:08:00,810
Yes, that's really sad.

1750
02:08:05,823 --> 02:08:06,881
Hey Rahul.

1751
02:08:07,658 --> 02:08:09,853
Who is your show stopper for the Delhi show?

1752
02:08:10,327 --> 02:08:14,161
I heard that just like Vinay Khosla,
you too have roped in a film star.

1753
02:08:14,665 --> 02:08:17,133
No, no. I like film stars.

1754
02:08:17,201 --> 02:08:19,669
But if there was a model..

1755
02:08:19,737 --> 02:08:24,003
..for a show stopper for this show..
that's best. - Yes.

1756
02:08:24,241 --> 02:08:27,074
You know l.. really miss a good model.

1757
02:08:29,013 --> 02:08:31,345
Like Shonali..
- And, Meghna.

1758
02:09:13,958 --> 02:09:15,016
Meghna.

1759
02:09:20,397 --> 02:09:21,455
Dear..

1760
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:24,731
..the one who loses..

1761
02:09:24,802 --> 02:09:27,396
..isn't the one who falls.

1762
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:30,737
But a failure is one..

1763
02:09:30,808 --> 02:09:33,140
..who still doesn't rise to the occasion.

1764
02:09:34,945 --> 02:09:37,743
My daughter is not a loser.

1765
02:09:40,818 --> 02:09:41,944
I'm sorry, my dear.

1766
02:09:45,990 --> 02:09:48,754
It was my fault that l..

1767
02:09:48,826 --> 02:09:52,762
..didn't trust my daughter's dream..

1768
02:09:52,830 --> 02:09:56,095
..and how high it could take her.
- Papa..

1769
02:09:59,770 --> 02:10:01,761
I had trust in my daughter..

1770
02:10:01,839 --> 02:10:03,033
..and I still do.

1771
02:10:06,477 --> 02:10:10,971
Go ahead, pursue your dream again.

1772
02:10:12,850 --> 02:10:13,908
Yes, my dear.

1773
02:10:19,957 --> 02:10:21,083
Go back, my dear.

1774
02:10:23,294 --> 02:10:24,488
You will achieve success.

1775
02:10:29,066 --> 02:10:30,124
Yes, dear.

1776
02:10:32,870 --> 02:10:34,861
Go dear, go back.

1777
02:11:07,104 --> 02:11:09,902
Thought I'd come and apologise.

1778
02:11:13,844 --> 02:11:15,072
But I can't.

1779
02:11:22,286 --> 02:11:24,948
Look Janet, I know I really hurt you.

1780
02:11:27,324 --> 02:11:28,382
I was wrong.

1781
02:11:31,328 --> 02:11:34,320
But when I decided to come back..

1782
02:11:35,933 --> 02:11:38,026
I couldn't think of anyone else but you.

1783
02:11:42,973 --> 02:11:44,133
So, I came right here.

1784
02:11:50,614 --> 02:11:52,047
I did the right thing, didn't l, Janet?

1785
02:12:01,492 --> 02:12:02,550
Welcome back.

1786
02:12:05,496 --> 02:12:06,554
I am so sorry.

1787
02:12:12,903 --> 02:12:16,964
So, you know what.. I've now
specifically told all the actors..

1788
02:12:17,408 --> 02:12:20,605
You may borrow clothes for
a function, but do return them.

1789
02:12:21,145 --> 02:12:22,305
Yes, you know they just..

1790
02:12:23,914 --> 02:12:24,972
Typical.

1791
02:12:27,418 --> 02:12:31,218
Oh my God. Oh my God.. Iisten, listen.

1792
02:12:32,623 --> 02:12:33,920
Guess, who is back in town.

1793
02:12:35,926 --> 02:12:36,984
Meghna Mathur.

1794
02:12:39,930 --> 02:12:41,989
Wow.. - Back from the dead or what?

1795
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:46,629
Hi Vinay, I am back in town.
I would like to meet you.

1796
02:12:47,137 --> 02:12:48,661
Please, let me know
when I can call you.

1797
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:51,965
Spare me the horror.

1798
02:12:52,276 --> 02:12:53,937
Who wants to speak to her?

1799
02:12:59,116 --> 02:13:00,549
Guess what?
- What?

1800
02:13:01,118 --> 02:13:02,176
Same message.

1801
02:13:03,187 --> 02:13:05,018
She's sent it to everyone.

1802
02:13:05,089 --> 02:13:07,455
Desperate.
- I tell you.

1803
02:13:12,629 --> 02:13:15,029
You know, she always
compared herself to Shonali.

1804
02:13:16,300 --> 02:13:18,461
Mark my words, someday
she will lose it, just like Shonali.

1805
02:14:07,117 --> 02:14:12,054
Bye.. - Bye. I'll see you.
- Yes. - For dinner? - Yes.

1806
02:14:13,624 --> 02:14:15,615
Manav, that was excellent.
- Thank you.

1807
02:14:15,692 --> 02:14:17,023
We need a close up.
- Okay.

1808
02:14:17,094 --> 02:14:18,527
Go to the rest room.
- Alright.

1809
02:14:18,595 --> 02:14:20,654
Well, be back in half an hour.
- Sure. - Mahesh!

1810
02:14:20,731 --> 02:14:22,028
Set up a trolley.
Make it fast, come on.

1811
02:14:37,614 --> 02:14:39,343
You went through a lot in your life..

1812
02:14:43,420 --> 02:14:45,081
..but the good thing is
that you have come back.

1813
02:14:47,224 --> 02:14:52,389
Listen.. don't worry.
Everything is going to be okay.

1814
02:14:54,131 --> 02:14:56,224
I am sorry, Manav.

1815
02:15:00,504 --> 02:15:02,472
I know I've hurt you a lot.

1816
02:15:04,575 --> 02:15:05,633
It's okay.

1817
02:15:06,343 --> 02:15:10,803
I'm really happy for you,
today you're in the big league.

1818
02:15:11,148 --> 02:15:13,639
I am really happy..
- Well, hardly.

1819
02:15:13,717 --> 02:15:16,652
Hi baby.
- Oh, hi.

1820
02:15:16,720 --> 02:15:18,085
Am I disturbing you?

1821
02:15:18,155 --> 02:15:19,486
No, no. come in. that's fine.

1822
02:15:21,525 --> 02:15:24,085
Meghna, that's Ria.
- Ria, that's Meghna.

1823
02:15:24,161 --> 02:15:25,219
Hi.. - Hi. - Nice to meet you.

1824
02:15:25,295 --> 02:15:26,489
She is my fiance'e.

1825
02:15:30,234 --> 02:15:31,599
We just got engaged last month.

1826
02:15:31,668 --> 02:15:34,398
I heard a lot about you.
Nice to meet you.

1827
02:15:35,372 --> 02:15:38,739
Thank you. I.. I should go.

1828
02:15:38,809 --> 02:15:40,504
No, no. please..
- No, really.

1829
02:15:40,577 --> 02:15:41,635
Please stay for a while.

1830
02:15:42,246 --> 02:15:43,304
Some other time.

1831
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:47,612
Okay? Congratulations.
- Thanks. - Thanks.

1832
02:16:19,149 --> 02:16:23,142
It is said, the people you meet
on your way up to success..

1833
02:16:23,220 --> 02:16:27,213
..you encounter them again
on your way down.

1834
02:16:30,294 --> 02:16:32,228
It felt really weird.

1835
02:16:34,831 --> 02:16:39,165
The relations I left behind in
arrogance of my success..

1836
02:16:39,236 --> 02:16:44,264
..have left me and gone way ahead in life.

1837
02:16:45,509 --> 02:16:46,806
Everything had changed.

1838
02:16:48,745 --> 02:16:52,181
But thank God..
some relationships in life..

1839
02:16:52,249 --> 02:16:55,912
don't require an invitation for acceptance.

1840
02:17:00,324 --> 02:17:03,259
And this is going to be
your outfit for the show.

1841
02:17:03,427 --> 02:17:04,485
Nice?
- Nice.

1842
02:17:05,229 --> 02:17:07,254
It's beautiful.

1843
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:14,660
Rohit.. thank you.
- For what?

1844
02:17:17,207 --> 02:17:18,469
For giving me this opportunity.

1845
02:17:20,544 --> 02:17:22,375
I know that you didn't have to do it.

1846
02:17:24,848 --> 02:17:27,612
And everyone must have
advised you not to.

1847
02:17:28,218 --> 02:17:31,619
Who cares..
No one knows you like I do.

1848
02:17:31,888 --> 02:17:35,380
Look, if I could have my way,
you would be my show stopper.

1849
02:17:36,627 --> 02:17:40,222
But Meghna.. the sponsors..
you know how it is.

1850
02:17:40,297 --> 02:17:42,288
I know.. Rohit I know.

1851
02:17:43,533 --> 02:17:46,331
The fact that l' m even in
your show, means a lot.

1852
02:17:50,307 --> 02:17:54,334
After all, it is my first show
on comeback and..

1853
02:17:54,411 --> 02:17:58,780
Trust me.. you are going to rock. Okay?

1854
02:18:14,665 --> 02:18:15,996
Hey, are you nervous.

1855
02:18:17,734 --> 02:18:18,996
Don't worry.. want to drink?

1856
02:18:20,404 --> 02:18:21,462
No thanks.

1857
02:18:31,014 --> 02:18:33,744
"Some distance is,,

1858
02:18:33,884 --> 02:18:36,011
,,fighting loneliness,"

1859
02:18:36,486 --> 02:18:37,544
"ls it love?"

1860
02:18:37,754 --> 02:18:39,016
"ls it trust?"

1861
02:18:41,892 --> 02:18:43,553
Meghna..
- Hi.

1862
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:44,818
Meghna, are you okay?

1863
02:18:44,895 --> 02:18:45,953
Yes, of course.

1864
02:18:46,029 --> 02:18:48,827
Look, don't worry.
You'll be absolutely fine. Okay?

1865
02:18:48,965 --> 02:18:50,023
Are you sure?

1866
02:18:50,300 --> 02:18:51,358
You are looking gorgeous.

1867
02:18:51,501 --> 02:18:53,696
Sir.
- Yes.. - Thanks.

1868
02:18:53,904 --> 02:18:56,429
Look, the show stopper has come.
I'll be back in a minute.

1869
02:18:56,573 --> 02:18:57,631
Okay?
- Bye.

1870
02:18:59,976 --> 02:19:04,709
Hi, Fabiana. You just tell me,
my assistants are there to help you.

1871
02:19:04,848 --> 02:19:07,043
And let's go to the lounge,
yes. Okay, come.

1872
02:19:10,654 --> 02:19:14,317
Guess what? I had no clue
and I walked in and then..

1873
02:19:14,391 --> 02:19:15,449
..i was..

1874
02:19:15,792 --> 02:19:17,384
Okay girls, let's stand in order.

1875
02:19:17,594 --> 02:19:20,461
Meghna, you are not here.
You are after Brinal.

1876
02:19:20,530 --> 02:19:21,861
Brinal, stand here..
- I am sorry.

1877
02:19:21,932 --> 02:19:22,990
Meghna.. Sucheta..

1878
02:20:31,668 --> 02:20:32,726
Move.. move.

1879
02:20:36,139 --> 02:20:38,937
"Something special, "

1880
02:20:51,488 --> 02:20:53,479
Okay, listen.
Meena is the next girl, right?

1881
02:20:53,623 --> 02:20:56,148
Okay, tell her to come on the head
ramp and take Meghna away.

1882
02:21:18,048 --> 02:21:20,175
Listen, this is second
change for Meghna.

1883
02:21:20,450 --> 02:21:21,917
Just leave her,
I'll handle her.

1884
02:21:22,052 --> 02:21:24,179
Okay, just do the same.
I'll handle her.

1885
02:21:26,056 --> 02:21:28,490
Meghna, just relax, okay?

1886
02:21:28,859 --> 02:21:31,191
Meghna, just relax.

1887
02:21:55,552 --> 02:21:57,747
Meghna, it is alright. It happens.

1888
02:21:58,088 --> 02:21:59,146
It's alright?

1889
02:22:00,490 --> 02:22:02,219
I ruined everything, Janet.

1890
02:22:04,227 --> 02:22:06,024
I froze on the head ramp.

1891
02:22:06,096 --> 02:22:08,087
Do you even understand
what it means?

1892
02:22:08,231 --> 02:22:09,562
That means nothing at all.

1893
02:22:10,567 --> 02:22:11,761
It happens sometimes.

1894
02:22:14,037 --> 02:22:15,095
It doesn't happen, Rahul.

1895
02:22:19,175 --> 02:22:23,771
I don't think I have
it in me anymore.

1896
02:22:24,781 --> 02:22:25,907
Oh, come on,
Meghna.

1897
02:22:26,049 --> 02:22:27,516
You were nervous then, that's all.

1898
02:22:28,051 --> 02:22:29,985
I mean, you walked
the ramp after a year.

1899
02:22:30,253 --> 02:22:33,780
Meghna just think,
how will your dad feel?

1900
02:22:37,794 --> 02:22:42,254
Meghna, relax..
you have to be very strong.

1901
02:22:43,199 --> 02:22:44,928
You have to believe in yourself.

1902
02:22:47,137 --> 02:22:48,536
You know how this industry works.

1903
02:22:49,205 --> 02:22:52,140
There is no room
for weakness.

1904
02:22:52,943 --> 02:22:54,001
Alright.

1905
02:23:07,824 --> 02:23:10,292
Listen.. isn't that Shonali?
- The model?

1906
02:23:10,694 --> 02:23:11,752
Just see.

1907
02:23:12,095 --> 02:23:13,562
Isn't that Shonali the model?

1908
02:23:14,965 --> 02:23:16,956
How long have you been here?
- Shut up.

1909
02:23:17,167 --> 02:23:18,600
Madam.
- Shut up!

1910
02:23:18,702 --> 02:23:19,760
Go away!

1911
02:23:19,836 --> 02:23:22,168
Madam, do you know anyone here?

1912
02:23:22,639 --> 02:23:23,697
Madam, please tell us.
Do you know anyone here.

1913
02:23:32,115 --> 02:23:34,583
People say that she has
been here for the last two days..

1914
02:23:34,651 --> 02:23:36,312
and isn't talking to anyone.

1915
02:23:36,586 --> 02:23:38,577
Shonali Gujral's distressing story..

1916
02:23:38,655 --> 02:23:41,988
highlights another truth
of the fashion industry.

1917
02:23:42,058 --> 02:23:43,116
It is evident..

1918
02:23:43,193 --> 02:23:45,991
that the profession isn't
as glamorous as it seems.

1919
02:23:46,196 --> 02:23:47,595
With cameraman Mahesh Pakhare..

1920
02:23:47,664 --> 02:23:50,326
..this is Umesh Kumawat
for Star News, Mumbai.

1921
02:24:03,880 --> 02:24:05,006
Listen, lnspector..

1922
02:24:05,215 --> 02:24:06,614
..instead of roaming
on the streets..

1923
02:24:06,883 --> 02:24:09,613
..instead of making a mockery
in front of the media..

1924
02:24:09,686 --> 02:24:11,347
..it is better that
we take her along.

1925
02:24:11,755 --> 02:24:14,155
Our NGO will
take good care of her.

1926
02:24:14,357 --> 02:24:15,654
Madam, it's a procedure.

1927
02:24:16,092 --> 02:24:17,616
Until her family members don't come..

1928
02:24:17,694 --> 02:24:19,355
And don't take her along or..

1929
02:24:20,230 --> 02:24:21,356
..she doesn't say anything.

1930
02:24:21,965 --> 02:24:23,830
We can't let you take her.

1931
02:24:32,709 --> 02:24:34,370
Madam, do you know her?

1932
02:24:36,913 --> 02:24:37,971
Yes, I do.

1933
02:24:50,393 --> 02:24:53,260
Meghna, it's a huge responsibility.

1934
02:24:54,130 --> 02:24:55,392
You yourself are struggling.

1935
02:24:56,066 --> 02:24:58,261
Can you afford to look
after her as well?

1936
02:25:02,272 --> 02:25:05,264
I haven't thought about it, Janet.

1937
02:25:08,011 --> 02:25:09,069
All I know is..

1938
02:25:11,081 --> 02:25:12,412
I'm not doing it for Shonali..

1939
02:25:14,150 --> 02:25:15,208
..but for myself.

1940
02:25:19,089 --> 02:25:20,420
I really need to do this.

1941
02:25:28,898 --> 02:25:29,956
Okay.

1942
02:25:41,444 --> 02:25:45,710
After bringing Shonali
home I realized..

1943
02:25:45,782 --> 02:25:48,444
..that our lives were quite similar.

1944
02:25:50,053 --> 02:25:51,987
Both of us had lost ourselves.

1945
02:25:53,857 --> 02:25:55,722
The happiness I achieved in helping..

1946
02:25:55,792 --> 02:25:57,726
..Shonali come back to a normal life..

1947
02:25:57,794 --> 02:26:02,254
was more important than the happiness
of professional success.

1948
02:26:03,933 --> 02:26:10,463
As she got better, I regained
the self confidence I had lost.

1949
02:26:37,167 --> 02:26:39,158
Listen, listen.
Breaking news.

1950
02:26:39,369 --> 02:26:43,499
My darling Rahul has bagged
the finale at the fashion week.

1951
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:46,037
Cheers.
- That's fantastic.

1952
02:26:46,109 --> 02:26:47,770
Wow, Rahul.
That's fantastic. - Cheers.

1953
02:26:47,911 --> 02:26:49,970
The biggest show ever.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1954
02:26:50,046 --> 02:26:51,513
In fact everything was
finalised yesterday.

1955
02:26:51,781 --> 02:26:55,512
Tie a line of top models
and a surprise show stopper.

1956
02:26:55,919 --> 02:26:56,977
Who is the show stopper?

1957
02:26:57,120 --> 02:26:58,382
Like Vinay Khosla's..

1958
02:26:58,788 --> 02:27:02,781
Rohit.. you know in fact
she is the best right now.

1959
02:27:05,395 --> 02:27:06,919
Ms. Meghna Mathur.

1960
02:27:07,530 --> 02:27:10,055
Surprise!

1961
02:27:11,201 --> 02:27:12,259
Yeah.

1962
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:17,939
Guys, I don't think that's
a good idea. I mean..

1963
02:27:19,943 --> 02:27:21,535
After what happened
at Rohit's show..

1964
02:27:22,011 --> 02:27:24,536
I don't think that's a good idea.

1965
02:27:24,814 --> 02:27:27,544
We've given this
a lot of thought.

1966
02:27:32,288 --> 02:27:36,224
I know you'll are doing this for me.

1967
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:39,827
I mean, I really appreciate it.
I do, I am really grateful, but.

1968
02:27:41,297 --> 02:27:43,424
But.. I.. can't do your show Rahul.

1969
02:27:43,900 --> 02:27:47,097
I am sorry. I am sorry.

1970
02:27:53,243 --> 02:27:54,904
Why don't you want to do the show?

1971
02:27:55,311 --> 02:27:56,437
Please.

1972
02:27:57,447 --> 02:28:01,247
You do know how i mportant
this show is for you, don't you?

1973
02:28:02,452 --> 02:28:03,578
Come on, Shonali.

1974
02:28:04,520 --> 02:28:06,579
You do know what happened
during Rohit's show?

1975
02:28:10,460 --> 02:28:12,121
This show is very
important for Rahul.

1976
02:28:15,932 --> 02:28:18,457
I can't let the same thing
happen to him too, you know.

1977
02:28:21,471 --> 02:28:23,871
Meghna, you aren't
worried for Rahul..

1978
02:28:23,940 --> 02:28:25,601
..but you're afraid of failing again.

1979
02:28:28,611 --> 02:28:30,875
Rahul has so much confidence in you..

1980
02:28:30,947 --> 02:28:32,881
..isn't it fair..

1981
02:28:32,949 --> 02:28:36,350
..to prove him right?

1982
02:28:40,089 --> 02:28:41,147
You can do it.

1983
02:28:49,499 --> 02:28:51,626
We have lost a lot here.

1984
02:28:54,504 --> 02:28:56,028
I know there's no hope for me.

1985
02:28:57,173 --> 02:29:01,633
Shonali.. - But if this show
helps you make a comeback..

1986
02:29:03,980 --> 02:29:05,311
It is worth the risk.

1987
02:29:25,335 --> 02:29:27,462
I have never interfered
in your decisions.

1988
02:29:28,071 --> 02:29:29,129
So why do it now?

1989
02:29:29,405 --> 02:29:30,463
Because, I am concerned.

1990
02:29:30,673 --> 02:29:33,267
To make Meghna the show
stopper for such an important show..

1991
02:29:33,476 --> 02:29:34,534
..it's foolishness!

1992
02:29:35,411 --> 02:29:37,675
And you know
what she did at Rohit's show.

1993
02:29:38,281 --> 02:29:39,976
I don't think she has
it in her, anymore.

1994
02:29:41,617 --> 02:29:43,676
Look Rahul,
try and understand.

1995
02:29:44,287 --> 02:29:45,345
The situation is different.

1996
02:29:45,955 --> 02:29:48,685
People from the Paris Fashion
Week are coming to see the finale.

1997
02:29:49,225 --> 02:29:50,692
If there is any problem in this show.

1998
02:29:51,094 --> 02:29:52,561
Then Paris is out of the question.

1999
02:29:53,563 --> 02:29:56,157
It could be disastrous
for you and for my brand.

2000
02:29:57,233 --> 02:30:00,430
Abhijeet, I know you
care about me, but..

2001
02:30:00,636 --> 02:30:01,694
I think you are overreacting.

2002
02:30:02,171 --> 02:30:03,229
Nothing ofthat sort will happen.

2003
02:30:03,373 --> 02:30:04,431
Maybe you are right.

2004
02:30:04,574 --> 02:30:06,701
But is it necessary to take
such a big risk for this show?

2005
02:30:07,243 --> 02:30:09,234
There are other shows,
give her a chance there.

2006
02:30:09,512 --> 02:30:11,377
No, Abhijeet. It'll be too late then.

2007
02:30:12,315 --> 02:30:14,715
I mean, Meghna needs
our help right now.

2008
02:30:16,319 --> 02:30:19,516
Look, I know what I am doing.
Just trust me.

2009
02:30:20,523 --> 02:30:21,581
You think about it.

2010
02:30:34,070 --> 02:30:35,401
Oh!!

2011
02:30:43,746 --> 02:30:46,408
The Kimaya Fashion Week
has begun with a controversy.

2012
02:30:46,749 --> 02:30:49,013
Bollywood's ace
designer Vinay Khosla..

2013
02:30:49,085 --> 02:30:53,749
has accused upcoming designer
Zulfi Khan with stealing his designs.

2014
02:30:54,090 --> 02:30:56,149
Zulfi has copied all my designs.

2015
02:30:56,759 --> 02:30:59,751
I had designed them for a film,
which he has stolen from there.

2016
02:31:00,096 --> 02:31:02,155
I can show you the DVD.

2017
02:31:07,370 --> 02:31:08,769
Side.. side, please.

2018
02:31:15,111 --> 02:31:18,774
Rohit's driver will come
to pick you up from the airport.

2019
02:31:19,048 --> 02:31:21,778
Come directly to the venue.
Okay? - Did you have dinner?

2020
02:31:22,051 --> 02:31:23,643
No, I have just returned
from a fitting session.

2021
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:27,521
Okay dear, take care of yourself.
We will be there.

2022
02:31:27,723 --> 02:31:29,247
Okay.
- Bye. - Bye.

2023
02:31:39,268 --> 02:31:40,326
Shonali!

2024
02:31:50,346 --> 02:31:51,404
Shonali!

2025
02:31:58,154 --> 02:31:59,212
Shonali!

2026
02:32:07,163 --> 02:32:08,221
Oh no.

2027
02:32:13,703 --> 02:32:14,829
Shonali..

2028
02:32:32,722 --> 02:32:34,713
One second.
- Okay. - Yes, Meghna.

2029
02:32:35,191 --> 02:32:37,125
Janet, Shonali isn't at home.

2030
02:32:37,193 --> 02:32:39,593
The house is a mess.
Don't know what to do?

2031
02:32:39,729 --> 02:32:40,855
Relax, Meghna. Take it easy.

2032
02:32:41,731 --> 02:32:42,857
What is it?
- We'll be there soon.

2033
02:32:52,475 --> 02:32:53,533
Who are these people?

2034
02:32:53,743 --> 02:32:54,869
Who are they?

2035
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:01,808
Hi. Biren..

2036
02:33:02,752 --> 02:33:03,878
Hi.. have you seen Shonali around?

2037
02:33:05,688 --> 02:33:06,746
Did she come here?

2038
02:33:07,623 --> 02:33:08,681
Why would she come here?

2039
02:33:09,358 --> 02:33:10,416
Desperate woman!

2040
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:12,619
She hasn't paid me five thousand
for the stuff as yet.

2041
02:33:13,229 --> 02:33:14,560
She's probably lying
around on the streets.

2042
02:33:17,233 --> 02:33:18,894
Okay, thanks.

2043
02:33:20,303 --> 02:33:21,361
Let's go.

2044
02:33:25,841 --> 02:33:27,172
Shinde, pay attention.

2045
02:33:27,510 --> 02:33:29,910
If you get any information,
call immediately.

2046
02:33:30,780 --> 02:33:32,441
Alright.

2047
02:33:33,583 --> 02:33:35,915
We've sent out a search party.

2048
02:33:36,185 --> 02:33:37,777
Look, don't panic.

2049
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:39,911
We have your number.

2050
02:33:42,458 --> 02:33:44,722
Ifwe get any information..

2051
02:33:45,194 --> 02:33:46,252
..we will call you.

2052
02:33:46,329 --> 02:33:47,921
But..
- Relax.

2053
02:33:48,798 --> 02:33:50,925
Sir, please try your best.

2054
02:33:51,400 --> 02:33:53,391
Meghna, let's go.

2055
02:33:54,537 --> 02:33:55,663
Thank you, inspector.
- Thank you.

2056
02:34:00,209 --> 02:34:01,471
Meghna, enter..

2057
02:34:01,877 --> 02:34:06,337
"Don't know ifl am.."

2058
02:34:06,749 --> 02:34:08,478
Walk properly, Meghna.
What are you doing?

2059
02:34:14,890 --> 02:34:16,687
You forgot your turn, Meghna!

2060
02:34:17,226 --> 02:34:18,284
Meghna, come on.

2061
02:34:18,361 --> 02:34:19,419
Concentrate on what you have to do.

2062
02:34:20,496 --> 02:34:21,758
Sorry.

2063
02:34:25,968 --> 02:34:27,629
Don't worry.
We'll find Shonali.

2064
02:34:27,970 --> 02:34:29,437
We've informed the police.

2065
02:34:29,839 --> 02:34:30,965
Everything will be alright.

2066
02:34:31,374 --> 02:34:33,842
You just focus on the show, okay?

2067
02:34:34,310 --> 02:34:36,505
And I promise everything will be fine.

2068
02:34:36,579 --> 02:34:38,979
Got it?
- Yes, got it.

2069
02:34:39,248 --> 02:34:40,306

"l shall give up my life. "

02:38:48,564 --> 02:38:49,826

02:38:49,965 --> 02:38:51,489

2120
02:39:01,176 --> 02:39:02,507

2122
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:12,519

02:39:12,788 --> 02:39:15,120

Meghna, now!

2129
02:42:12,701 --> 02:42:15,693
When we dream, nobody tells
us what we'd have to..

2130
02:42:15,771 --> 02:42:17,966
..give up to achieve them.

2131
02:42:19,241 --> 02:42:24,702
I lost Shonali in the same
moment I achieved success.

2132
02:42:26,381 --> 02:42:28,246
I was pained by her loss.

2133
02:42:28,984 --> 02:42:34,718
But I had the feeling that
she gave me a reason to dream.

2134
02:42:46,268 --> 02:42:49,726
Even after everything
I went through..

2135
02:42:49,805 --> 02:42:53,332
Iife provided me another opportunity.

2136
02:42:54,276 --> 02:42:56,141
To find myself again.
