00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:00,042
23.976

2
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:56,708
This planet earth is a part
of the Universe.

3
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,125
The Creator, is called...

4
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:11,541
the God, the Almighty,
the Omnipotent One!

5
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:18,125
But our story is not based on God...

6
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:23,416
it's the story of those people
who have come in this world...

7
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:27,167
and who are a part of the Almighty!

8
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:31,375
And that part, procures life
and comes on this earth...

9
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,667
and is called a human being.

10
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,458
The man who is not aware
of his objective and goal...

11
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:45,084
and cannot manage to reach it...

12
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:49,875
lives like an ordinary human being.

13
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:54,209
But the man who is aware of his
objective and goal of life...

14
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:01,000
and to achieve it, he doesn't give
importance to life or death...

15
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,291
That man rises above all
the ordinary human beings...

16
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:14,375
and is called the infinite power!

17
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,084
- l am honored with your arrival!
- Oh! So you recognize me?

18
00:04:57,084 --> 00:05:01,458
Haven't you called
the police to protect you?

19
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,416
We are safe now that you are here!

20
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,875
Then why didn't you invite me?

21
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:19,125
Who will give me money,
you or this boy's father?

22
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,042
You have insulted me by not
inviting me, take the girl along!

23
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:30,750
She's my wife, you have
no right to take her away!

24
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,291
ln that case, l have
all the right to kill you!

25
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:42,084
- Leave me! - Please leave her!

26
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:48,917
The man who is aware of his
objective and goal...

27
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,834
who is aware...

28
00:05:55,834 --> 00:06:01,875
and to achieve it, he doesn't give
any importance to life or death...

29
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:08,542
doesn't give any importance
to life or death...

30
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:13,208
that man rises above all
the other ordinary human beings...

31
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,500
and becomes the infinite power!

32
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,333
Come quickly brother and save them!

33
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:27,125
Help me!

34
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:10,125
Hit him!

35
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:03,750
Wonder where he has gone leaving
the door open and the lights on.

36
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,625
Such a crazy boy he is!

37
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:24,667
There is no place in this country l
haven't searched in the last 6 months.

38
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,417
When l heard that
a courageous man...

39
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:37,041
beat up a deadly dacoit, Manohar Dev
from Thambore, along with his gang...

40
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:42,542
l was sure it could be only you,
that is why l came here.

41
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:46,833
You confidence and information
were absolutely right.

42
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:51,041
l always had faith in you, now even
they have started believing in you.

43
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:58,333
- l have come to take you, Prabhat.
- l am happy here, l feel at peace!

44
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:03,833
- l don't want to leave this place.
- You can run away from yourself...

45
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:08,750
but not from your deeds.God has sent
all of us to perform certain duties...

46
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:14,375
if we fail to do that then
neither will we ever be happy...

47
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,625
nor can we ever obtain peace!

48
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,750
You've said what you wanted to
and l've announced my decision.

49
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,041
lts not a decision,
its a blind belief!...

50
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:26,625
...an obsession of a wounded man!

51
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:31,709
There are ups and downs in life but
how can you turn your back to life?

52
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:36,417
l will not let you stay here and
will not listen to any explanations!

53
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:40,875
lf you don't relent and come with me
then l'll have to forcibly take you.

54
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:44,667
Come with me!

55
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:46,833
l have shot many a times
with these hands.

56
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,875
But on those people whom l hate.

57
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:54,584
l wouldn't like to shoot the person
whom l respect a lot.

58
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:59,459
That is why, you go away from here.

59
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:03,584
l don't want to return back
to the world of blind men.

60
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:07,584
Living among these stones,
hasn't yet made you like a stone...

61
00:13:07,584 --> 00:13:10,833
that will make you forget
the people you love.

62
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,375
On your insistence l am leaving
today but remember one thing...

63
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:18,958
l'll surely take you from here.
l'll certainly accomplish my mission!

64
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,167
l fail to understand which mission
you want to accomplish!

65
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:27,167
Why don't you understand that
l have lost everything.

66
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,750
Go away from here
and leave me alone!

67
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,791
Go away from my life!

68
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:24,375
This is how l shoot!

69
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:30,459
Munna, stop this noise, your elder
brother shoots in the whole city...

70
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:32,250
atleast let peace prevail
in this house!

71
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,750
You are angry with the elder son and
are reprimanding the younger one?

72
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,584
Prabhat has given this gift
to Munna for his birthday.

73
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:44,750
Sure! What else can he
give besides a gun?

74
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,584
Violence is his way of life!

75
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:51,666
He beats up the criminals so much
that they eventually die.

76
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,542
Brother is back home!
Happy birthday, brother!

77
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,500
- How are you? - Since morning,
he has been decorating the house.

78
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,791
Your birthday is like a festival for
him. Munna, leave your brother now.

79
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:15,042
Son, you must be tired.
Go and freshen up.

80
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:19,417
- lts quite late and you know
your father... - l know it.

81
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:23,833
l know how much my peace loving
father detests my uniform!

82
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,083
Yes, l detest your activities and...

83
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:32,125
Your father forgot to say that he has
invited his friend home for dinner.

84
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:37,750
They have come from Lucknow.
Son, go get dressed quickly.

85
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,083
And l will make arrangements
for the prayers.

86
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:44,625
May God give you a long life and
may the Goddess always bless you!

87
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,958
Brother, this is
your present from me.

88
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:56,375
- Brother, sing a song today.
- Song?! - Why not?

89
00:15:56,375 --> 00:16:00,375
Nobody could beat you in playing
the mouth organ in your college days.

90
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:05,292
- Please sing! - And these days,
nobody can beat him in shooting.

91
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,833
Pray that he pleads to God
to show him the right path!

92
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:15,209
People who walk on the path of peace
are considered great in this world!

93
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,833
Anurag, you are aware that
we are a very small family.

94
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,167
We always go out together.

95
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:58,375
On one hand, is my daughter Kusum,
who is my world...

96
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:02,917
and on the other hand is
my wife's brother, Mr. Sharma.

97
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:06,667
- lsn't it, Mr. Sharma?
- Yes, Mr. Verma.

98
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:12,209
His niece should not lack any love
that is why, he did not get married.

99
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
- lsn't it, Mr. Sharma.
- Yes, Mr. Verma.

100
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,750
But its known in entire Lucknow
that even you did not remarry.

101
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:23,084
So that you don't have to
share your food with anybody.

102
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:29,250
- Don't feel shy, lets start eating.
- Mr. Sharma, let us attack the food!

103
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:32,375
Father, control yourself!

104
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,833
- Tell me, brother! - Yes, Munna!

105
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:41,208
What do you think of sister in law,
l liked her a lot, she's like mother!

106
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:44,625
Which sister in law,
whom are you talking about?

107
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:50,750
l heard our parent's conversation,
your marriage is fixed with her.

108
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:59,208
Why did they do this?

109
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:04,375
l am already married but with death!

110
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:07,583
l am married to my uniform!

111
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:11,875
By marrying me, your daughter
could get widowed anytime!

112
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,375
Balbir, did you find out anything?

113
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:30,084
Sir, l am sure that those two dead
bodies belong to Blue Panther gang.

114
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:34,917
Our informer told us of the rivalry
between them and Bhardhwaj brothers.

115
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:38,291
There is a fear of riots
breaking in the city...

116
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,583
due to which the innocent
will also be victimized.

117
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:44,917
lsn't Madan the chief
of the Bhardhwaj gang?

118
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:49,667
But till date, we haven't found out
about the chief of Blue Panther gang.

119
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:53,416
Mr Ajghar, the consignment that
you've sent is rotting in the godown.

120
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:57,084
Because our dealers have joined
hands with Bhardhwaj brothers.

121
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:01,084
They have stopped buying from us.
You've been abroad for years...

122
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:05,042
but its for the first time,
someone has tried to compete with us.

123
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:10,458
Madan Bhardhwaj is becoming more
powerful and has openly challenged us.

124
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,750
We have lost many of our men
in this enmity.

125
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:19,708
You come here & handle the situation
or you'll lose control in lndia.

126
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:25,750
You call a meeting of all
your dealers and Bhardhwaj brothers.

127
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,291
l'll come to lndia and
resolve this issue forever!

128
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:32,125
Alright!

129
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:19,667
As per your wishes, we have
arranged for a meeting tonight.

130
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:25,750
Today if these dealers don't listen
to us then they'll pay a heavy price.

131
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:31,750
Before that we will have to show the
Bhardhwaj brothers their position.

132
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:36,583
Relax! Keep your head cool
for some time.

133
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:42,709
Son, you are new to this country's
police and the enemies.

134
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:46,834
Since its your first visit to lndia,
you don't attend the meeting...

135
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:50,375
and keep a close watch on the
activities of the Bhardhwaj brothers.

136
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:54,083
So that we can give them
a befitting reply.

137
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:57,917
The rest of you come with me.

138
00:24:57,917 --> 00:25:02,667
He is Gafforbhai, the king of
illicit liquor in Mumbai.

139
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:08,500
He is Nanvalli, the wholesaler
of opium and brown sugar.

140
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,000
He is the supplier
of illegal weapons.

141
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:17,625
You'll know Mr. Madan and
Mr. Ajghar very well.

142
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,583
We have no differences
with either of you'll.

143
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:27,834
lts true that till yesterday,
we bought foreign goods from you.

144
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:32,041
But now, we all have decided that...

145
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:34,166
since we bought
the local things from Mr. Madan...

146
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:38,125
we will buy the foreign goods
also from him.

147
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:43,375
- Why? - ln Mumbai,
even the beggars require a protector!

148
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:48,667
Afterall, we are dealers, Mr. Madan
will offer us the goods & protection.

149
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:52,250
Be it related to the police
or to the rival gangs.

150
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,041
You live in Kenya and when we have
someone of our own country...

151
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:59,458
then why should we
depend on a foreigner?

152
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:05,000
You have heard
the grievances of our dealers.

153
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:11,709
Now gather your belongings and go
away in search of some other place!

154
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:17,250
Whom are you talking to? You still
are a child in front of us!

155
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,292
Once you'll see us in action,
you will take back your words!

156
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:26,584
- Don't provoke me or l'll...
- Peace, Nagdank!

157
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,584
The path of peace will be
appropriate for you, Ajghar!

158
00:26:32,584 --> 00:26:37,333
Because l don't value
you more than...

159
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:43,542
a beggar begging for
alms on the roads!

160
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:50,834
You scoundrel! l will kill you.

161
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:52,916
l will feed you
to the vultures you...

162
00:26:52,916 --> 00:27:00,542
Peace! Often a weak man screams
and tries to prove himself powerful.

163
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,750
And you are not weak!

164
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:08,667
This man will not leave like this,
we'll have to throw him out!

165
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:14,542
This is the only way to shoo away
stray dogs like him!

166
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:20,041
What are you'll watching?
Shoot all of them! Finish them off!

167
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,584
Peace Nagdank! Violence is
no solution to any problem.

168
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:46,875
When the dealers have accepted
Madan as their associate...

169
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:52,916
then it is not right for them
to depend on us foreigners.

170
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:57,000
So why should we have
enmity towards Madan?

171
00:27:57,041 --> 00:28:02,916
Madan, you can prosper.
We will return back to our country.

172
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,584
l give you 48 hours
to leave this country.

173
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:31,584
Brother, why did you give up
so soon? Why did you let them go?

174
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:38,417
Nagdank, he has slapped you but
its imprint is on my cheek!

175
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:45,041
l am feeling sorry
for that poor Madan...

176
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:51,333
that he has yet not learnt
the law ofjungle!

177
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:58,833
When and where a python
swallows someone...

178
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:02,833
even the person who is dying
does not realize it!

179
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:07,000
What, you will marry me today
evening? l don't believe it!

180
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:11,916
This is the truth,
l had promised you...

181
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:17,041
the day l will defeat Ajghar Jorhat
and become the don of this city...

182
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:19,833
that day, l will marry you!

183
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:25,750
l will leave now. l've to make
arrangements for the evening.

184
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:42,000
- Sister! - Take care of yourself.

185
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:47,667
How l wish our younger brother
Aakash, was with us on this occasion.

186
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:51,417
l would be the happiest man
on this earth!

187
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:58,333
But unfortunately, to pursue his
principles, he lives in his own world!

188
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:05,042
But yet l am sure, wherever he is,
he must be missing us.

189
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:26,916
Madan Bhardhwaj is convinced that by
defeating us, he can rule this city!

190
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:31,916
And today is his
first night after marriage.

191
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:38,542
lf you permit us, we can turn
this night into his last night!

192
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:46,083
Brother, l am waiting anxiously
to finish him off!

193
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:52,459
- You stopped me or... - There was
a reason for my stopping you.

194
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:59,584
lnspite of living abroad for last
20 years, we are ruling this city.

195
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:04,584
And inspite of trying hard,
the police here...

196
00:31:04,584 --> 00:31:09,208
has never been able to find
any clue about us.

197
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:16,250
At that moment, if you
would kill him in anger...

198
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:20,750
then the police,
not only in this country...

199
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:26,125
but in other country also
will pursue and find out about us.

200
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:32,584
Today is a very auspicious day
for all of us.

201
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:38,375
And l'll not tell you to keep peace,
l'll tell you to spread violence!

202
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:43,459
We shall spell such a doom
on Madan Bhardhwaj...

203
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:48,916
that for ages nobody will ever know
that a man by this name ever existed!

204
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:58,292
You will not harm Madan Bhardhwaj!

205
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:03,542
You will be the one who will be
doomed and that too, by me!

206
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,917
Who is Madan Bhardhwaj's
younger brother?

207
00:32:08,917 --> 00:32:16,542
Don't move till the police arrives or
you'll be responsible for their death.

208
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:43,167
lnspector, you've misunderstood me.

209
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:45,167
l had phoned you and
asked you to come there.

210
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:49,375
Ajghar Jorhat and Blue Panther
gang are enemies with my brothers.

211
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:52,708
l went to stop them and
they attacked me also.

212
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:56,459
lnspector, let me go or
my brothers will be killed.

213
00:33:56,459 --> 00:34:00,417
You don't know how dangerous they
are. l'll come and surrender myself.

214
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:02,833
Just let me out for few hours.

215
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:07,042
You will not go anywhere! lts the
duty of the police to stop this fight.

216
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:11,458
Besides, your brothers are criminals
too, they'll be caught by the police.

217
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,292
Today you seem to be very worried
about your brothers.

218
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:18,541
Why didn't you make them understand
that they'll face death in their work?

219
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:26,083
l tried to make them
understand a lot.

220
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:59,084
Brother!

221
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,666
No!

222
00:35:05,084 --> 00:35:08,084
Madan, no!

223
00:35:16,292 --> 00:35:20,750
Leave me, l say!

224
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,792
Madan Bhardhwaj is dead!

225
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:49,167
We should leave this place
before someone comes here.

226
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:38,792
Finish them too!

227
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:51,959
Halt!

228
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,833
Nagdank, what happened to you?

229
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:32,333
- What is the name of that
inspector? - His name is Prabhat.

230
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:37,792
- He is very headstrong. - We'll
get his corpse in front of you!

231
00:37:38,042 --> 00:37:42,708
No! l will not kill
my enemy that easily.

232
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,291
My name is Ajghar!

233
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:54,708
And with my venom, l will spread
such a poison in his life...

234
00:37:56,416 --> 00:38:00,959
that he will be tortured
for all his life!

235
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:08,250
Just tell me what
he is fond of the most!

236
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:13,583
Munna, come here quickly!

237
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:17,875
Look, your brother's friends
have come to meet you.

238
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:30,583
Your brother has sent us here.

239
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:39,500
Every member of
the Bhardhwaj gang was killed.

240
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:44,250
And that too, in front of you and
yet, you could not do anything!

241
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:49,042
lf you can't handle it then l'll hand
over this charge to some other officer.

242
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:53,583
Sir, give me some more time,
very soon l will nab them.

243
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:56,125
Because l have come to know about
the head of the Blue Panther gang.

244
00:38:56,125 --> 00:39:00,625
He is called Ajghar Jorhat.
But the strange thing is...

245
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,959
that he lives abroad and not here.

246
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:07,084
Nobody knows when he comes here
and strikes his enemies.

247
00:39:07,084 --> 00:39:08,959
But he cannot escape anymore.

248
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:11,583
l have identified him.

249
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:16,208
Great! When you weren't successful,
you could not prevent destruction...

250
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:18,959
you start blaming
the foreign hand!

251
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:21,500
And which Ajghar Jorhat
are you talking about?

252
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,834
lf there is a criminal by that name
then he has no police records.

253
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:28,917
Then has he appeared
from the thin air?

254
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:33,416
You have been staying
in a dream world these days.

255
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:37,708
l will hear no further and take
the charge from you today itself!

256
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:42,917
And hand it over
to inspector Balbir.

257
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:51,542
Alright sir, you will get
my resignation tomorrow morning.

258
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:56,625
Mr. Ajghar, the situation
is not in your favour.

259
00:39:56,625 --> 00:40:00,416
l have compelled Prabhat
to resign but...

260
00:40:00,416 --> 00:40:05,250
hearing Prabhat, DCP Gupta has
started doubting you.

261
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:08,625
And he is Prabhat's guardian.

262
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:12,375
After reaching home, when
Prabhat sees his brother's state...

263
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:15,625
he will explode like a volcano!

264
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:19,708
Leave this country
as soon as possible.

265
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:35,959
Welcome, my son!

266
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:41,000
See, what a great gift your
well wishers have sent for us.

267
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:44,333
See who this is!

268
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:52,917
Don't touch him with
your blood stained hands!

269
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:57,208
Look at him, he has paid a price
for your evil deeds!

270
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:02,750
You are his murderer. l was
fed up explaining it to you...

271
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:06,166
don't indulge in such work,
stop yourself!

272
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:10,542
But nothing could work in front of
your pride. Now see the result!

273
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:13,542
lf you look up and walk,
you are bound to fall down!

274
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:17,083
Now get out from here!

275
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:22,041
- What are you saying, Anurag?
- How is he to be blamed for this?

276
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:25,500
lt is because of him
that my son is dead.

277
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:30,792
l don't need him anymore. l'll
think that both my sons are dead!

278
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:38,625
Will you kill me with your
blood stained hands now?

279
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:43,792
You will kill me showing me by
showing your face! Get out from here!

280
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:48,500
Get out from our lives! We aren't
connected to you anymore!

281
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:53,500
Get out from here!

282
00:41:53,500 --> 00:42:00,041
Go away, get out!
You have killed your brother!

283
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:06,917
Get out and never show
your face ever again!

284
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,834
Brother, l have never seen
brave men crying.

285
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:15,834
When my father was killed
by Manohar Dev...

286
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:20,000
even l cried a lot. My mother
also died with the grief.

287
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:26,500
Now l have stopped crying.
There aren't anymore tears left.

288
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:29,625
My tears were also dead...

289
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:33,500
someone reminded me, that is why
my memories were refreshed.

290
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:38,041
When my father used to teach the
Bhagvad Gita, he used to say that...

291
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:41,375
the people who fight forjustice
should have weapons in their hands...

292
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:44,583
and no tears in their eyes!

293
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:46,834
The Pandavas had
Lord Krishna with them ...

294
00:42:46,834 --> 00:42:50,333
and the Kauravas had
their father, Dhridhrashtra.

295
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:54,834
- But who is with me?
- l am with you, my son.

296
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:59,667
The injustice that l mete out on you
had stopped me from coming to you.

297
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:05,417
l could not overcome
my shameful behavior...

298
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:09,375
But when Mr. Gupta also gave up
in front of you...

299
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:12,417
then l thought of coming here
to take you back.

300
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:18,458
- Father! - Yes son, that day
you had returned wounded from work...

301
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,041
and even l injured you!

302
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:26,834
l, the believer of non-violence,
resorted to violence!

303
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:31,458
My son's death had made me selfish.

304
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:36,500
l am not the only father
who had lost his son.

305
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,417
Many people have made such sacrifices
infact, even bigger than this!

306
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:46,166
Today, l have come
to take my son back.

307
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:51,792
For me, for my country and
for this whole world!

308
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:55,500
You have come to reside
in this unknown surroundings...

309
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,125
and there, the devastation by
the Blue Panther gang has increased.

310
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:06,375
There are bomb blasts & killings
taking place in the broad daylight!

311
00:44:06,584 --> 00:44:10,834
And when the police could not
do anything to these criminals...

312
00:44:10,834 --> 00:44:13,584
then Commissioner Pandey
decided to get you back.

313
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:19,500
l promise that hereafter, l will
never impose my principles on you.

314
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:23,083
The answer to an attack
should be given by an attack!

315
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:26,916
Go and fight this battle
the way you want!

316
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:29,958
God forbid but even if
you lose in this battle...

317
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:33,916
then my head will always
be raised with pride.

318
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:37,250
lnstead of being called
a coward's father,...

319
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,958
l would rather be called
a martyr's father!

320
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:44,709
Father, until yesterday,
there was no hope in my life.

321
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:50,750
But now l can see a ray of hope,
l will surely come with you, father.

322
00:45:04,417 --> 00:45:08,916
We take pride in informing that a
brave and honest inspector like you...

323
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:13,500
is being sent for a very difficult
and a dangerous mission to Kenya.

324
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,041
To accomplish this mission you will
have to be very smart and alert.

325
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:18,916
Because we would not like
to strain....

326
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:24,041
the economic or the political
relations with the Kenya Government.

327
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:29,292
We have appointed an lndian from
the Kenya police to help you.

328
00:45:29,292 --> 00:45:33,916
But that inspector or any other
officer should not ever learn that...

329
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:37,542
you have gone there
to arrest Ajghar Jorhat.

330
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:41,125
Because this man is
a respectable citizen of that place.

331
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:44,833
Keeping this in mind, you have to
accomplish your mission.

332
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:49,375
Prabhat, you have to
gather evidence against him.

333
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:52,041
So that we can prove that
he is a very dangerous criminal.

334
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:57,333
You will have to arrest him alive
at any cost and get him to lndia.

335
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:02,916
l promise that l will not put our
Government to shame in a foreign land.

336
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:06,916
l will expose him in Kenya
and arrest him there.

337
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:10,459
But you will have to comply
to my wish before l leave.

338
00:46:10,459 --> 00:46:14,542
- What is that? - When you know
the reality about Ajghar...

339
00:46:14,542 --> 00:46:17,500
then you must be also aware
that Aakash is innocent.

340
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,958
You will have to release him.

341
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:23,041
His arrest is a burden
on my conscience.

342
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:27,500
The police department has already
made an appeal for his release.

343
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,875
- lt has been accepted. - But even
you'll have to listen to one thing.

344
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:35,958
For which l have
the Minister's permission too.

345
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:40,375
You'll have to take Aakash along,
he can do something for his country.

346
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:43,375
And he also gets the chance to
prove himself as a good citizen.

347
00:46:43,375 --> 00:46:48,417
Besides, Aakash knows
Ajghar Jorhat's family very well.

348
00:46:48,417 --> 00:46:52,667
- But sir... - This is my order!

349
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:05,584
Jailor, have l heard it right
that my sentence has waived?

350
00:47:05,584 --> 00:47:11,208
l always said that my character was
not bad as inspector Prabhat thinks.

351
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:14,916
Your sentence is not waived,
you have been released on bail.

352
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:18,791
That too, because of
inspector Prabhat's attempts.

353
00:47:24,584 --> 00:47:28,500
He has been specially sent here
to take you Mumbai.

354
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,250
Our Government is sending him
to Kenya on a special mission...

355
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,833
and you will have to accompany him.

356
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:39,042
This is a very good opportunity
to prove to everyone...

357
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:42,417
that you have the desire
to do something for your country.

358
00:47:42,417 --> 00:47:46,625
lf you are successful in this then
you can even be released.

359
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:51,750
Oh! So he can help me
to get released?

360
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,708
l don't want to know
on which mission he is going.

361
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:57,584
But l will surely go with him.

362
00:47:57,584 --> 00:48:01,750
So that l can avenge
my brother's death!

363
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:05,666
l am waiting for you
outside, Aakash.

364
00:48:11,042 --> 00:48:14,625
She cannot overcome the shock
that she has received.

365
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:18,625
Only time can heal her wounds.

366
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:22,167
You can take her home if you wish.

367
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:27,875
Sister, l will not spare the person
who has ruined your life!

368
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,167
No matter if l have to
lose my life for it.

369
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:41,000
Your death is a wound on my heart
which will help me to find the killers.

370
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:48,917
You have a life ahead of you,
try to lead it in a better way.

371
00:48:48,917 --> 00:48:52,500
- Don't ruin it for my sake.
- May my son return victorious!

372
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:57,042
- l pray to God only for this.
- He'll definitely be victorious!

373
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:59,750
- lsn't it Mr. Sharma?
- Yes, Mr. Verma.

374
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:03,167
And son, may God
fulfill your wish too!

375
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:08,625
My?! That will surely be
fulfilled with your blessings.

376
00:49:08,917 --> 00:49:12,708
lt will surely be fulfilled
if your intentions are clear.

377
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:16,541
- lsn't it, Mr. Sharma?
- Yes, Mr. Verma.

378
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:20,708
Live long!
l will wait for your return.

379
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:24,583
Like this country, even l need you!

380
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:28,875
Take care and don't forget that
you have to get them back alive.

381
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:33,750
The country's, yours as well as
my honor is at stake.

382
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:38,292
Don't worry, our Prabhat
will not disappoint you.

383
00:49:38,292 --> 00:49:40,583
- lsn't it, Mr. Sharma?
- Yes, Mr. Verma.

384
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:45,583
- Shall we leave, Aakash?
- Yes! Shall l go! - Yes!

385
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:51,250
l have rested enough,
now let's do some work!

386
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:06,167
We have finally reached Kenya!

387
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:10,375
But nobody seems
to be around to welcome us.

388
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:13,750
And yes, your foreigner
officer is not to be seen!

389
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:19,334
He may be living here but
he is an lndian. He will find us.

390
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:24,334
l have found you'll and
even recognized you'll!

391
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:36,042
- l am Aakash Bhardhwaj from the
lndian thief force. - Excuse me!

392
00:51:36,042 --> 00:51:40,792
You are joking! lt feels really good
to meet your fellow countrymen.

393
00:51:42,292 --> 00:51:45,750
Look at me, although l was
raised up and now even work here...

394
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:48,708
but yet,
l long to see my motherland.

395
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:51,292
Once you go there, your desire
will be satisfied forever!

396
00:51:51,292 --> 00:51:57,042
Don't mind his words, he's not
learned that's why he talks like that!

397
00:51:57,625 --> 00:52:02,125
What?...he is praising me!

398
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:10,917
Mr. Ajghar, l was pressurized by
the Minister and DCP Gupta...

399
00:52:10,917 --> 00:52:13,708
l had to call for Prabhat Singh.

400
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:17,875
And l had to send him to Kenya
due to my legal duties...

401
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:20,750
to arrest you!

402
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:27,458
And yes, Aakash Bhardhwaj, who could
be a problem after being released...

403
00:52:28,917 --> 00:52:32,833
even he is accompanying
Prabhat to find you.

404
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:37,084
l am sure that they will
return back to lndia...

405
00:52:37,084 --> 00:52:41,541
but not alive, their corpses
will come back in coffins!

406
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:50,917
lf you permit me then l can finish
them and throw them into the sea.

407
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:55,042
No, don't do any such thing
due to which the police notices us.

408
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:01,958
You don't worry, l will
kill them in such a way that...

409
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:06,333
their death will look
like an accident.

410
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:15,833
The weather is also very pleasant,
you will enjoy it here.

411
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:21,042
And please give me
the pistols that you have.

412
00:53:21,042 --> 00:53:25,708
This is a peace loving country,
you will not need these guns here.

413
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:30,583
But this is for our protection
besides, we have a permission.

414
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:35,000
l am not denying that. You can
take it when you go back.

415
00:53:36,042 --> 00:53:39,833
But the Government here
does not allow it.

416
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:42,416
Besides, why do you need weapons?

417
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:44,917
You concentrate on the mission
that you are here on.

418
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:47,959
And if you need any help,
l am always there.

419
00:53:47,959 --> 00:53:52,416
l have been specially
appointed to help you.

420
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:59,125
Don't do any such thing
that will cause inconvenience...

421
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:03,291
to the Government,
the citizens or to you.

422
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:14,084
There is no need to trust
these foreigners.

423
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:18,541
Keep a close watch on them
for all 24 hours.

424
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:21,583
lts the question of diplomatic
relations between two countries.

425
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:26,250
And since you are an lndian,
its your duty to take care of them.

426
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:31,000
Remember one more thing, our police
department or our Government...

427
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,333
should not be defamed
due to their activities.

428
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:37,708
l have to take care of them
and keep a vigilance on them...

429
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:43,458
without their knowledge and after
few days, send them back to lndia.

430
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,708
The one whom you are looking for,
its first step is Bubble Discotheque!

431
00:55:13,416 --> 00:55:18,416
There is a celebration going on
there for a girl called Sonia.

432
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:20,750
She will be the second step
to your destination.

433
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:26,042
By now you must have understood.
Keep this, you'll need it!

434
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:42,250
Yesterday l had requested you'll not
to go anywhere without my knowledge.

435
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:44,250
Then where are you'll going now?

436
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:49,291
We have heard that the youth of this
place are fond of Bubbles Discotheque.

437
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:52,042
We thought that you would get bored
there, we'll come back after dinner.

438
00:55:52,042 --> 00:55:56,875
- You need not take the trouble.
- lts my duty to serve you.

439
00:55:56,875 --> 00:56:00,500
Besides, l won't get the opportunity
to go to Bubbles Discotheque again.

440
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,208
- Come, l'll take you there.
- Lets go.

441
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:16,542
Wow! This is a great place. Will we
get country liquor in this place?

442
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:21,333
No, you will get imported scotch
here which is very expensive.

443
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:26,458
You have come here but
do you have money for the liquor?

444
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:32,333
He is my responsibility. So l have
to fulfill all his legal demands.

445
00:56:33,291 --> 00:56:35,583
And it is absolutely legal
to drink in this country!

446
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:38,416
Yes but as far as
he is in his senses.

447
00:56:38,416 --> 00:56:43,042
And if he gets drunk then as per
the law, he will be behind bars.

448
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,208
Shall we go?

449
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:51,375
lmported whiskey!

450
00:56:54,959 --> 00:56:59,875
This will not quench my thirst
but beggars cannot be choosers!

451
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:08,708
- Who are you and what do you want?
- My name is Renuka.

452
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:13,458
Like you, even l am an lndian and
have been compelled to come here.

453
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:19,542
Our destinations are the same.

454
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:24,583
And l am sure that with your help,
l can reach there.

455
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:28,375
Unknowingly, inspector Surya Pratap
can create an obstacle in your way.

456
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:33,542
l will try my best
to keep him away from you.

457
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:41,709
My fellow lndian brothers,
ladies and my special guests...

458
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:50,792
l, Tapaswi Gunjal, welcomes
you all to my Disco Bubbles.

459
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:56,500
l am very delighted to inform
you all guests present here that...

460
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:02,083
its my friend, Miss Sonia's
18th birthday today.

461
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:08,083
My Sonia!

462
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:14,083
Very beautiful!

463
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:23,792
She is Sonia,
Ajghar Jorhat's only daughter.

464
00:58:40,959 --> 00:58:46,166
This applause should be for you!

465
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:48,375
Who are you and how do you know me?

466
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:52,917
The stories of your bravery is
printed even in lndian newspapers.

467
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:58,041
You entered the Omani drug dealers
gang and arrested them alone.

468
00:58:58,041 --> 00:59:02,709
You even entered the Kenya Airways
plane & made the kidnapers surrender.

469
00:59:03,417 --> 00:59:08,041
You are a pride of
we lndians in Kenya!

470
00:59:09,375 --> 00:59:13,709
On this special occasion,
for your entertainment...

471
00:59:13,709 --> 00:59:18,542
l have arranged for an exclusive
dance and song programme.

472
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:26,125
And have called a young beauty across
the seven seas, especially from lndia!

473
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:19,000
lf you are tired then you can
proceed home with your friends.

474
01:06:21,292 --> 01:06:23,833
What do you intend doing
by sending Sonia back?

475
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:29,917
This girl will please you and also
add to the honor of this discotheque.

476
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:35,541
You keep the vehicle ready, l will
go and get that beautiful girl.

477
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:42,209
l will entertain that
girl until morning.

478
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:48,125
They were looting the bank and running
away and as soon as l reached there...

479
01:06:49,875 --> 01:06:52,750
- lts there. - Even l am
feeling uncomfortable.

480
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:56,292
- Okay but not more than 2 minutes.
- 2 minutes? - Let's go!

481
01:06:56,292 --> 01:07:00,292
Why don't you tell me more stories
until they both return back?

482
01:07:00,292 --> 01:07:04,833
The image of our disco has been
enhanced due to your voice and dance.

483
01:07:05,292 --> 01:07:10,083
That is why, it is our duty
to take care of your needs.

484
01:07:10,083 --> 01:07:12,375
- l have made special arrangements
for your stay. - Thank you.

485
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:17,125
And l will personally
drop you there by my car.

486
01:07:39,167 --> 01:07:42,000
He's taken her!

487
01:07:48,375 --> 01:07:51,875
And when l put my hand in the pocket,
l found that my revolver is missing.

488
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:57,125
- Then? - Even l fought back and
they fell like a pack of cards!

489
01:07:57,708 --> 01:08:03,708
And...where have these two gone?

490
01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:35,000
- What are you doing?
- Very beautiful!

491
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:40,042
Everything is insignificant
as compared to your beauty!

492
01:08:40,042 --> 01:08:44,416
Even a sage may get
lured looking at you.

493
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:47,750
And afterall,
l am an ordinary human being!

494
01:08:51,292 --> 01:08:55,292
Leave me, you rogue!

495
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:58,750
Leave me, l say!

496
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:07,875
- Don't stop me!
- Leave me, Prabhat help!

497
01:09:15,875 --> 01:09:20,042
Don't call him out!
Fulfill my desire!

498
01:10:28,375 --> 01:10:31,875
Attack!

499
01:10:40,209 --> 01:10:42,875
Today these people will kill you!

500
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:48,333
And if you are saved then
l will not spare you!

501
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:14,416
Please be gentle or else
you will break my hands.

502
01:12:21,917 --> 01:12:26,458
- What is this happening?
- l was protecting my friend.

503
01:12:26,834 --> 01:12:31,291
- Oh, l see! - l will...

504
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:38,000
l will get exposed!

505
01:12:40,166 --> 01:12:44,458
- But l won't need this anymore.
- Come on.

506
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:53,375
When you'll did not come back, l
was sure you'll were up to something.

507
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:58,166
ls it a crime
to save a girl's honor?

508
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:01,875
No, but taking the law in your
hands is definitely a crime.

509
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:06,166
You could have told me, for what
purpose is the police available?

510
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:10,000
Anyway, come let me drop
you to your hotel.

511
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:14,792
Try to understand, Kusum.

512
01:13:14,834 --> 01:13:18,166
The task that l have undertaken
is very dangerous.

513
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:21,875
Any mishap may occur at any time.

514
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:27,583
l have decided that either l will
marry you or l will die here itself!

515
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:38,000
You have won, Kusum!

516
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:46,125
This house is more safe than
staying alone outside at this hour.

517
01:13:46,375 --> 01:13:50,083
And you have seen
what happens outside.

518
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:53,625
And only two of us
stay in this huge house.

519
01:13:53,625 --> 01:13:59,083
- My daughter and me.
- Your daughter?!

520
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:05,042
There she is!
Her name is Sunaina.

521
01:14:05,042 --> 01:14:09,375
- l'll introduce you to her in the
morning. - And where is your wife?

522
01:14:11,042 --> 01:14:15,458
- She is not there.
- She isn't alive?

523
01:14:17,166 --> 01:14:21,291
Yes, she died in an accident.

524
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:25,667
Please tell me about it.

525
01:14:28,041 --> 01:14:34,125
Sometimes, fate plays
a cruel joke on us.

526
01:14:35,625 --> 01:14:41,041
God's mercy was on me,
l had a very good life...

527
01:14:42,542 --> 01:14:48,583
respect in the police force,
a very happy family.

528
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:56,083
One day suddenly,
there was such a tempest...

529
01:14:56,083 --> 01:15:03,250
that left me completely bereft
and snatched away my wife from me!

530
01:15:07,542 --> 01:15:12,041
My daughter suffered such a shock
of her mother's death...

531
01:15:14,083 --> 01:15:18,291
that she just turned into
a living corpse.

532
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:23,458
She was with her mother
on that fateful night.

533
01:15:24,959 --> 01:15:29,166
Whenever l ask her
about that incident...

534
01:15:29,166 --> 01:15:34,875
she becomes quiet and subdued
and keeps on looking at me.

535
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:39,208
All she does is keep crying.

536
01:15:39,208 --> 01:15:43,542
She wakes up in the night
screaming with fright.

537
01:15:44,542 --> 01:15:49,375
She's scared of the outside world and
starts crying at the mention of school.

538
01:15:55,083 --> 01:16:00,583
lnspite of my unending efforts, l
didn't find any clue of those killers.

539
01:16:02,709 --> 01:16:09,792
How l wish thatjust once
my daughter identifies them...

540
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:17,709
l'll teach them such a lesson that
they'll never repeat it again!

541
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:33,333
- Leave me! - Don't be foolish, what
do you get after toiling so much?

542
01:16:33,625 --> 01:16:37,709
l'll give you all
the luxuries of the world.

543
01:16:37,709 --> 01:16:42,125
- Just come to me once! - Leave me,
you don't know my husband.

544
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:45,333
Damned be your husband!

545
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:54,333
Mr. Tapaswi, please save me!

546
01:16:55,542 --> 01:16:59,458
You have to fulfill the wishes
of my friend's brother.

547
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:06,792
- You will not get me even after
my death! - Nobody can save you here.

548
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:20,333
They killed my mother!
Now they will kill me too!

549
01:17:22,834 --> 01:17:27,000
- What happened, child? Why are
you crying? - They killed my mother!

550
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:31,375
- Now they will kill me too!
- Don't cry, l am with you, child.

551
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:35,709
- Aunty, will you sleep with me?
- Yes, child.

552
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:41,500
- Aunty, please don't leave me
and go. - No, l will not.

553
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:08,792
My mermaid! l wish
even l knew to swim.

554
01:18:08,875 --> 01:18:14,667
- Why are you ogling at her?
- l wish l was as lucky as you!

555
01:18:14,875 --> 01:18:18,667
Then she would be with me!

556
01:18:20,958 --> 01:18:24,958
Here comes Lord Krishna
of this century!

557
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:45,292
My dear, my inspiration, how are you?

558
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:52,667
- How did you get a black eye?
- l will tell you in details.

559
01:18:53,417 --> 01:18:58,000
Now this weakling
will spin some tale!

560
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:01,333
Our dancer, the one who was dancing
at the discotheque the other day...

561
01:19:01,333 --> 01:19:05,500
after you left, an anti-social
element kidnaped her...

562
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,709
and tried to molest her!

563
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:10,417
She called for help
and l went to rescue her.

564
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:14,833
And l started battling
with that goon.

565
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:21,000
And in such acts of heroism,
brave men do get injured!

566
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:26,875
Just hear him talk!
How l wish she was with me.

567
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:31,459
Okay, l will go and change
and meet you in the lobby.

568
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:38,375
This creep is always
latched on to her!

569
01:19:38,542 --> 01:19:42,542
Are you jealous?
You always talk big things...

570
01:19:42,542 --> 01:19:47,083
- but let me make things
easy for you. - How?

571
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:53,750
- l understood. - l didn't
understand. - But she did.

572
01:19:56,958 --> 01:20:01,833
- How are you Tapaswi Chandal?
- Not Chandal, l am Gunjal.

573
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:05,708
You? l mean, its you, sister?!

574
01:20:05,708 --> 01:20:10,625
Shall l tell her who tried to
molest and who was beaten up?

575
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:14,083
l plead to you!
You are like my sister.

576
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:19,042
l promise that hereafter, l will
consider all women as my sisters.

577
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:25,125
- You please don't say anything
to Sonia. - Do you promise me?

578
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:29,708
- Then lets shake hands. - Okay.

579
01:20:29,708 --> 01:20:34,875
My sister is very nice,
everyone must have a sister like you!

580
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:51,542
Ajghar Jorhat, Aakash
will reach Sonia...

581
01:20:51,542 --> 01:20:55,167
and Sonia will help me to reach you!

582
01:21:12,625 --> 01:21:17,625
That wicked woman has made me wet!
Wonder where Sonia is now?

583
01:21:34,167 --> 01:21:37,542
Where is he going?

584
01:21:37,542 --> 01:21:41,083
Where are you taking me?

585
01:21:48,042 --> 01:21:52,250
Have you gone mad? Who are you?

586
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:58,875
l say stop the car!

587
01:21:58,875 --> 01:22:01,958
What an impudent man you are!

588
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,083
You?!

589
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:26,209
Respected father, this is the crook
who tried to abduct Sonia.

590
01:23:26,459 --> 01:23:30,334
lt was an insult to me that is why
l captured him and got him here!

591
01:23:30,334 --> 01:23:32,958
Now you give him
a befitting punishment.

592
01:23:32,958 --> 01:23:38,334
He has cast an evil eye
on my girlfriend!

593
01:23:44,292 --> 01:23:48,334
So the prey has come
himself to me!

594
01:23:49,167 --> 01:23:52,833
For the first time
you have done something wise.

595
01:23:52,833 --> 01:23:58,334
Now we shall send him
to join his brothers.

596
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:01,875
So this is where you've come?

597
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:06,292
Now l know why Prabhat
has got me here.

598
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:11,500
You have understood but
your stupid friend did not.

599
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:16,458
Your death has pulled you'll
to this place.

600
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:23,334
Look how he is
hanging like a monkey.

601
01:24:55,292 --> 01:24:58,084
Stop him!

602
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:28,334
Respected father, he's gone like
a hurricane. What will we do know?

603
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:35,125
- Lets follow them? - No!
A python doesn't sting his victim.

604
01:25:36,708 --> 01:25:41,334
He coils all over them
and breaks their bones!

605
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:46,750
And he chokes them to death!

606
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:52,125
Today, l have fallen in my own eyes.

607
01:25:52,375 --> 01:25:57,541
l always hated you
and tried to kill you.

608
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:02,042
But today, you did not
care about your own life?

609
01:26:04,375 --> 01:26:09,167
The death of your brothers was like
a burden that's why, l got you here.

610
01:26:09,167 --> 01:26:12,333
So that you can avenge their death.

611
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:16,833
l was aware that you hated me and
l would also do what you did.

612
01:26:18,958 --> 01:26:23,708
Can you do one more favour? None of
my family members are alive today.

613
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:28,750
Can you treat me as your friend,
as your brother?

614
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:33,125
When two brothers meet,
there is no place for a favour.

615
01:26:36,042 --> 01:26:43,458
l don't know why Aakash & Prabhat
have come & why are you helping them?

616
01:26:44,084 --> 01:26:48,250
But you please be wary of them

617
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:52,209
because one of them is a suspended
police inspector...

618
01:26:52,209 --> 01:26:54,416
and the other is
a professional criminal.

619
01:26:54,416 --> 01:26:59,458
They tried to misbehave
with my girlfriend, Sonia.

620
01:26:59,708 --> 01:27:04,000
Luckily l had seen you with them
at Disco Bubbles.

621
01:27:04,209 --> 01:27:09,209
- Or else l would have...
- Calm down, Tapaswi!

622
01:27:09,209 --> 01:27:13,792
We should not interfere
in the police matters.

623
01:27:14,084 --> 01:27:18,084
Whose picture is this?

624
01:27:18,416 --> 01:27:23,458
This is my daughter and
that is my deceased wife.

625
01:27:27,084 --> 01:27:30,875
Your daughter looks cute!

626
01:27:31,042 --> 01:27:36,042
Anyway, l will file your report and
henceforth, you'll have no problems.

627
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:38,875
Thank you!

628
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:43,959
This inspector Surya Pratap can
be more harmful than those two!

629
01:27:43,959 --> 01:27:46,500
- How is that?
- lf you remember two years back...

630
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:51,084
a lady had jumped from Tapaswi's
office and committed suicide due to me.

631
01:27:51,084 --> 01:27:53,541
And the police had made
an extensive inquiry of that case.

632
01:27:53,541 --> 01:27:57,959
Yes, that news had made the
headlines, which we had later buried.

633
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:04,458
That lady was none other than
inspector Surya Pratap's wife!

634
01:28:05,541 --> 01:28:09,875
O God! He is the most toughest
police officer in Kenya.

635
01:28:10,416 --> 01:28:15,084
lf he learns the reality,
he will make life miserable for us.

636
01:28:15,084 --> 01:28:19,750
Now l understand!
Why are you worried?

637
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:25,125
You are my son.
Now listen to my plan carefully.

638
01:28:27,125 --> 01:28:32,500
First, with the help of that honest
inspector, we will kill both of them.

639
01:28:34,167 --> 01:28:40,458
And then, we shall
give him salvation!

640
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:47,125
After that, only we shall
rule this world!

641
01:28:48,208 --> 01:28:52,708
And we shall become
the ultimate power!

642
01:28:56,542 --> 01:29:00,875
Friends, our associates are getting
us a special thing from lndia.

643
01:29:00,875 --> 01:29:06,500
Respected father, what is this
special thing that they are getting?

644
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:11,416
- That we'll know after they come.
- Father, think about them later.

645
01:29:11,416 --> 01:29:15,416
First think of a way we have to win
inspector Surya Pratap's trust.

646
01:29:15,416 --> 01:29:18,500
What is there to think.
We have to be like him.

647
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:22,208
We will pretend to be
honest like him, isn't it?

648
01:29:22,208 --> 01:29:26,625
That's perfect, respected father!

649
01:29:36,416 --> 01:29:41,333
The Blue Panther gang
has arrived in time!

650
01:30:05,542 --> 01:30:08,542
What is the special thing
that you've got?

651
01:30:11,917 --> 01:30:14,083
This is the original cast
and a real dye, Mr. Ajghar.

652
01:30:14,083 --> 01:30:16,625
For all your life, you can
print hundred rupee notes.

653
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:20,708
We have gone through
a lot of danger to steal this.

654
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:23,208
So that you can start a factory
of printing lndian notes here.

655
01:30:23,208 --> 01:30:29,375
And with the same shrewdness we shall
circulate it in the lndian market!

656
01:30:29,959 --> 01:30:34,625
Father, then we can control
the lndian economy sitting here.

657
01:30:34,625 --> 01:30:37,708
Respected father, this cast
will get us lot of money...

658
01:30:37,708 --> 01:30:41,208
if you permit me then
l will keep it safely.

659
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:45,333
l am very happy with your plan.

660
01:30:46,834 --> 01:30:50,708
From now, you will
work as my partners.

661
01:30:50,708 --> 01:30:55,333
Tonight, before the party,
we shall print its sample.

662
01:30:57,208 --> 01:31:01,834
You have already met Mr. Ajghar
Jorhat, he is a known exporter.

663
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:04,709
He has come to invite you.

664
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:10,375
After l left lndia, l have been
living here since past 20 years.

665
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:16,333
But l could not forget my nation
even for a moment.

666
01:31:16,333 --> 01:31:20,709
That is why, l am planning to give
a party to the lndians here!

667
01:31:22,375 --> 01:31:28,250
Wherein, all the lndians will
get together and enjoy themselves.

668
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:33,959

to specially invite you'll.

669
01:31:33,959 --> 01:31:38,083

01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:44,500
We'll surely come!

672
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:48,208
Lets go quickly,
Renuka must be waiting for us.

673
01:31:49,709 --> 01:31:54,709
- Greetings! - Greetings!

674

We are going there. l think
even you are going to the same place.

677
01:32:06,959 --> 01:32:11,125
- Yes. - lsn't it nice that all
the lndians are gathering abroad?

678
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:15,208
And since we are lndians,
its our duty to go there, isn't it?

679
01:32:15,208 --> 01:32:19,333
No, you'll can't go there.

680
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:25,834
Seeing your acts, the Commissioner
has ordered you'll won't go anywhere.

681
01:32:26,625 --> 01:32:32,166
And to stop you'll, he has assigned
special guards all around.

682
01:32:45,417 --> 01:32:49,542
- Were they dogs or lions?
- What do we do now?

683
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:07,333
Wow! Even on a close look,
one cannot tell the difference.

684
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:13,208
After tonight's party, l will
be called a true lndian patriot...

685
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:19,125
and there, l will
corrupt my own country!

686
01:33:21,375 --> 01:33:24,875

691
01:33:56,875 --> 01:33:58,875

01:34:57,750 --> 01:35:01,417
You are looking
very beautiful in this attire.

703
01:35:01,417 --> 01:35:04,417
Sir, its a turban.

Have you ever visited lndia?

708
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:20,584
No yet your majesty, but its
my desire to visit lndia atleast once.

709
01:35:21,167 --> 01:35:24,041
Desire? Then what are you doing here
with three medals on your uniform?

710
01:35:24,041 --> 01:35:29,500
Take a vacation and visit lndia
and satisfy your desire.

711
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:33,875
But how did you know that
l have three medals?

712
01:35:33,875 --> 01:35:38,250
From the left side of his palace,
you can see Taj Mahal & Kutub Minar!

713
01:35:38,542 --> 01:35:42,333
And from the right side, Delhi's
Red Fort & Calcutta's Howrah Bridge.

714
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:46,375
And the front side, its Charminar &
backside, the lmambada of Lucknow!

715
01:35:46,375 --> 01:35:49,625
From the back, you can
see the whole of lndia!

716
01:35:49,625 --> 01:35:53,542
Then why won't l be able
to see your three stars?

717
01:35:57,041 --> 01:35:59,750
These two have
started their stories!

718
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:03,916
You take away the inspector, if he
learns the truth, we'll be in trouble.

Gunjal, l have a business here.

724
01:36:31,708 --> 01:36:35,417
Please come to my Casino and

725
01:36:35,417 --> 01:36:39,500
l am not interested in gambling,
this is his department.

726
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,958
All l am interested in is
adding women in my harem.

727
01:36:41,958 --> 01:36:46,167
- What is your name?
- This is my would be wife, Sonia.

728
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:50,833

- Please take.
- No, l don't drink alcohol.

733
01:37:15,083 --> 01:37:19,542
Sometimes a person should
live for others too!

734
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:22,208
One should respect
others sentiments too!

735
01:37:22,208 --> 01:37:27,750
Drink this and start a new life
today and forget your old sorrows.

736

739
01:38:07,708 --> 01:38:13,542

- Very nice! - What?

740
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:19,417
- The spot on your forehead.
- Thank you.

741
01:38:19,625 --> 01:38:26,875

743
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:41,500
- The spot! - l think you are trying
to say something but you can't convey.

744
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:45,958
No!...Yes!

745
01:38:45,958 --> 01:38:51,958
- Tell me whatever is in
your heart. - Shall l?

746
01:45:55,708 --> 01:46:00,667
What happened?

747
01:46:03,875 --> 01:46:06,750
This is what happened, understand?

748
01:46:09,166 --> 01:46:14,458
You have put the entire
police department to shame!

749
01:46:15,208 --> 01:46:20,959
You danced in an obscene way in front
of the respected people of this place.

750
01:46:20,959 --> 01:46:26,917
But sir, l don't understand
how l could drink so much.

751
01:46:35,042 --> 01:46:38,625
This is a counterfeit note.

752
01:46:38,625 --> 01:46:41,959
That means they have started
printing fake notes too?

753
01:46:41,959 --> 01:46:45,375
And before these notes
reach our country...

754
01:46:45,375 --> 01:46:49,000
we will have to seize that machine.

755
01:46:51,834 --> 01:46:55,875
- Can l come in? - Oh my!
He is sober once again.

756
01:46:55,875 --> 01:46:59,083
l'll pretend to sleep.

757
01:47:04,834 --> 01:47:08,083
- Oh! lts you inspector.
- Were you'll sleeping?

758
01:47:08,083 --> 01:47:12,375
- Yes, he is.
- Were you'll here last night?

759
01:47:13,375 --> 01:47:17,875
- Yes! - No,
we were drinking in a party.

760
01:47:17,875 --> 01:47:20,542
- How did he know?
- What? - Nothing.

761
01:47:20,542 --> 01:47:24,625
- So you'll were here in the night?
- There was a strict guard outside...

762
01:47:24,625 --> 01:47:29,917
how could we go out? - Okay,
don't leave without my permission.

763
01:47:35,041 --> 01:47:37,291
What is the name
of that Hindi dictionary?

764
01:47:37,291 --> 01:47:40,709
- He had invited us to his Casino.
- How will that help?

765
01:47:40,709 --> 01:47:44,083
You wait and watch!

766
01:47:52,709 --> 01:47:56,750
He had invited me, what is his name?

767
01:47:56,834 --> 01:48:00,875
- He is not Bhandal, he is Gunjal.
- Whatever, l'll make him a pauper...

768
01:48:00,875 --> 01:48:05,208
and put his Casino for auction.
lsn't it, my queen? - Yes.

769
01:48:05,208 --> 01:48:08,083
Which number should l play now?

770
01:48:21,291 --> 01:48:24,125
Now which number?

771
01:48:53,041 --> 01:48:57,083
- You know where to fix this magnet.
- Yes, your majesty!

772
01:48:57,083 --> 01:48:59,625
My lord, if you
lose like this then...

773
01:48:59,625 --> 01:49:03,792
My queen, first l encourage
my foes by losing.

774
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:07,208
Then l win everything and
turn them into bankrupts.

775
01:49:07,208 --> 01:49:10,709
You don't listen to me.
Nawab would have never let you play.

776
01:49:10,709 --> 01:49:13,625
l am looking for him.

777
01:50:57,750 --> 01:51:02,208
l have become a bankrupt?
My treasury is wiped out!

778
01:51:03,208 --> 01:51:06,083
And you fools could not
do anything about it?

779
01:51:06,083 --> 01:51:09,625
l have become a bankrupt!

780
01:51:14,167 --> 01:51:18,083
See what state
Chandal will be in now!

781
01:51:18,542 --> 01:51:21,041
Forgive me your majesty,
l was delayed.

782
01:51:21,041 --> 01:51:23,833
Actually, early in the morning,
l stepped on a radish leaf...

783
01:51:23,833 --> 01:51:26,958
and l caught cold!

784
01:51:27,958 --> 01:51:32,625
Never mind, your wishes and
my queen's love helped me to win.

785
01:51:32,625 --> 01:51:36,500
- lsn't it? - Do that later,
first think about these notes.

786
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:39,709
What will you do with this money.
lts foreign currency afterall.

787
01:51:39,709 --> 01:51:45,041
Why didn't l think of this before?
l'll give it to my subjects.

788
01:51:45,750 --> 01:51:50,208
What? Your majesty, will you give
away this wealth to your subjects?

789
01:51:51,041 --> 01:51:55,375
lf you give me 24 hours, l can
arrange lndian currency for you.

790
01:51:55,833 --> 01:52:01,000
- Our currency in this country?
- Do you have a printing machine here?

791
01:52:01,208 --> 01:52:06,167
- Yes! - What? - l mean,
l have a business in lndia.

792
01:52:06,417 --> 01:52:09,875
l will arrange for
the currency from there.

793
01:52:09,875 --> 01:52:14,875
Tomorrow, at 10 o'clock in the
morning, come at my residence.

794
01:52:14,875 --> 01:52:18,167
A bagful of currency
will be kept ready for you.

795
01:52:18,167 --> 01:52:22,417
- We'll get the money! - Yes!
- Lets go, my queen.

796
01:52:22,417 --> 01:52:25,417
- Okay, Tapaswi Kangal.
- Nawab, my name is Gunjal.

797
01:52:25,417 --> 01:52:28,459
We'll be there at 10 o'clock sharp.

798
01:52:30,709 --> 01:52:35,000
lndian currency!

799
01:52:55,167 --> 01:53:01,167
Greetings, your majesty!
Hello, Nawab!

800
01:53:02,958 --> 01:53:07,750
Will you'll yet say that
you did not cheat me?

801
01:53:07,958 --> 01:53:10,542
What do you'll want afterall?

802
01:53:10,542 --> 01:53:14,750
Why did you enter Ajghar Jorhat's
house uninvited?

803
01:53:15,042 --> 01:53:17,875
Tell me about
the mission you'll are on.

804
01:53:17,875 --> 01:53:22,042
lnspector, you know that we went
to that house in a disguise.

805
01:53:22,833 --> 01:53:26,875
Do you think that we were
interested in attending the party?

806
01:53:26,875 --> 01:53:31,459
You don't know the truth
why we duped you went there.

807
01:53:31,875 --> 01:53:36,625
We are doing it for the motherland
whose fragrance is in your breath too!

808
01:53:36,625 --> 01:53:42,542
l love my motherland!

809
01:53:42,542 --> 01:53:48,292
But if a decent man's
reputation is damaged...

810
01:53:48,292 --> 01:53:50,750
then l will be compelled
to do my duty.

811
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:53,875
We all are bound
to our duties, inspector!

812
01:53:53,875 --> 01:53:59,334
They may be civilized here but
possibly they are traitors in lndia!

813
01:54:00,417 --> 01:54:03,625
And l have also come here
in search of those traitors.

814
01:54:03,625 --> 01:54:08,958
They widowed my sister on
the first night of her marriage.

815
01:54:08,958 --> 01:54:12,750
The way your daughter screams
in the night remembering her mother...

816
01:54:12,750 --> 01:54:18,334
similarly, my sister's silence
echoes into my ears!

817
01:54:21,417 --> 01:54:26,500
Who are these beasts?

818
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:29,875
Tell me, l will
terminate their existence!

819
01:54:29,875 --> 01:54:34,417
You will not do it because according
to you they are respectable people.

820
01:54:34,417 --> 01:54:37,459
And we have no proof.

821
01:54:38,875 --> 01:54:41,417
l will get those criminals in front
of you along with evidence.

822
01:54:41,417 --> 01:54:44,459
This will be a favour on us.

823
01:54:47,542 --> 01:54:54,500
Alright, the people who have
betrayed lndia...

824
01:54:56,750 --> 01:54:59,833
the ones who have ruined
Renuka's sister's life...

825
01:54:59,833 --> 01:55:04,625
to get evidence against them,
l will give you 48 hours.

826
01:55:04,625 --> 01:55:09,042
But if you are wrong...

827
01:55:09,042 --> 01:55:13,459
then the law of this country
will not spare you!

828
01:55:16,958 --> 01:55:20,459
Here come the great fools!

829
01:55:21,083 --> 01:55:25,375
- Okay, Tapaswi Jholjhal...
- l am Gunjal, your majesty.

830
01:55:26,417 --> 01:55:30,292
lts the same!
l've come to take my money.

831
01:55:30,292 --> 01:55:34,958
Your majesty, l have managed
to gather 4 million...

832
01:55:34,958 --> 01:55:40,917
from the lndian Government
to save my Casino!

833
01:55:41,208 --> 01:55:45,708
That's okay but
l am upset with your hospitality.

834
01:55:45,708 --> 01:55:49,625
- Why? - Because,
you doubt our intentions...

835
01:55:49,625 --> 01:55:53,541
that you have made these men stand
here. Ask them to leave immediately!

836
01:55:53,541 --> 01:55:56,583
Or else, we will leave.

837
01:56:00,167 --> 01:56:02,833
As you wish!
Your majesty, your bags...

838
01:56:02,833 --> 01:56:07,083
The first lesson our elders
have taught us is that...

839
01:56:07,083 --> 01:56:11,042
when the matter is related to money
then you shouldn't trust anybody.

840
01:56:11,042 --> 01:56:12,167
Even though he is my father!

841
01:56:12,167 --> 01:56:16,459
That is why, you will count
the money in front of us.

842
01:56:16,459 --> 01:56:20,417
- l don't know to count.
- We will teach you.

843
01:56:20,417 --> 01:56:23,625
l wouldn't face this problem
if l had been to school.

844
01:56:23,625 --> 01:56:25,500
How do l count now?

845
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:31,209
- Shall we start? - One, two...

846
01:56:31,209 --> 01:56:35,500
One, two, three, four, if you forget,
don't feel shy, ask me.

847
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:40,167
One...two...three...four...

848
01:56:40,167 --> 01:56:43,833
- Five...six...
- No, this is five!

849
01:56:43,833 --> 01:56:48,167
This is five...six...
seven...eight...

850
01:56:48,167 --> 01:56:53,209
- This is nine... - Didn't you
go to school? That's ten!

851
01:56:55,750 --> 01:56:58,708
Whoever has made this,
has created a wonderful thing!

852
01:56:58,708 --> 01:57:03,250
- A dye to print notes! - Yes,
you can have as many as you want!

853
01:57:03,625 --> 01:57:07,541
Now nobody can try to challenge
the Blue Panther gang!

854
01:57:07,541 --> 01:57:11,375
Friends, your smartness
and courage is commendable!

855
01:57:11,375 --> 01:57:17,334
ln few days, we will be
the richest men in this world!

856
01:57:19,708 --> 01:57:22,334
This is 3.9 millions.

857
01:57:22,334 --> 01:57:26,792
- You have finally learnt!
- One..two...

858
01:57:27,833 --> 01:57:34,000
One...two...three...
four...five...six...

859
01:57:34,209 --> 01:57:39,666
...seven...eight...nine and
this is 4 million!

860
01:57:41,209 --> 01:57:44,417
Deceit!

861
01:57:47,875 --> 01:57:52,292
- Where did the dye go?
- lt was here. - Who took it away?

862
01:57:52,292 --> 01:57:54,417
What happened? Where is the dye?

863
01:57:54,417 --> 01:58:00,708
Father, those royal men have
duped us and taken my money.

864
01:58:01,958 --> 01:58:06,541
- l am finished!
- You all are fools!

865
01:58:06,541 --> 01:58:09,833
Those royal men were none other
than Prabhat and Aakash.

866
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:14,541
They have fooled you!
l want that dye.

867
01:58:14,541 --> 01:58:19,167
No matter where it is,
l want the dye!

868
01:58:25,750 --> 01:58:31,209
How does the pressure of my hand
on your neck feel, Ajghar Jorhat?

869
01:58:32,042 --> 01:58:37,875
l want that dye back, l am willing
to give whatever you ask for.

870
01:58:37,875 --> 01:58:41,292
But l want back the dye at any cost!

871
01:58:41,292 --> 01:58:46,792
Okay but we will finalize
the deal at your house.

872
01:58:49,042 --> 01:58:54,042
They are coming here to make a deal
regarding the dye.

873
01:58:54,042 --> 01:58:58,750
You'll be on alert,
until l don't get back the dye...

874
01:58:58,750 --> 01:59:01,750
nobody will shoot.

875
01:59:05,042 --> 01:59:07,666
We have come!

876
01:59:25,416 --> 01:59:28,750
You are an intelligent man.

877
01:59:28,750 --> 01:59:34,209
Don't act foolishly.
Give back the dye.

878
01:59:34,209 --> 01:59:37,416
And go away from this country.

879
01:59:37,875 --> 01:59:43,333
You cannot harm me in Kenya.
lnfact you will lose your life.

880
01:59:45,209 --> 01:59:47,750
And these two
will also be killed with you.

881
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:54,541
Don't threaten me. lf l had to kill
you, l would have done it long back.

882
01:59:55,958 --> 01:59:59,500
But l am police officer
and my duty is my faith!

883
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:02,084
l will take you to lndia alive!

884
02:00:02,084 --> 02:00:06,333
lnspector, think about your life
and leave this place quietly.

885
02:00:07,291 --> 02:00:12,708
Hey you! Hasn't your boss taught you
to speak to people superior than you?

886
02:00:14,959 --> 02:00:20,541
l think you have forgotten
how we had killed your brothers.

887
02:00:20,541 --> 02:00:24,084
And if you have forgotten then
take a look at your sister in law.

888
02:00:24,084 --> 02:00:25,959
You'll remember everything.

889
02:00:25,959 --> 02:00:30,500
You beasts! l am the younger sister
of that unfortunate woman.

890
02:00:32,375 --> 02:00:36,500
And l have also vowed that
until l will not kill you'll...

891
02:00:37,416 --> 02:00:39,750
l will not rest!

892
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:44,458
Shut up! When your sister could not
do anything then what can you do?

893
02:00:46,416 --> 02:00:51,084
Give back the dye or else the way
your parents lost your brother...

894
02:00:51,375 --> 02:00:55,291
similarly, they will not be able
to see you alive too!

895
02:00:58,209 --> 02:01:01,167
Ajghar, even we know to shoot.

896
02:01:01,167 --> 02:01:06,541
But in this fight, if you both die
then what will you do with the dye?

897
02:01:07,416 --> 02:01:10,875
Put down the guns.

898
02:01:13,416 --> 02:01:17,917
We are unnecessarily fighting, why
don't we make a deal for the dye?

899
02:01:18,708 --> 02:01:24,291
- Tell me what you want? - Before
he asks, listen to my demands.

900
02:01:25,375 --> 02:01:31,792
l can give you as much money you want
in any corner of the world!

901
02:01:32,625 --> 02:01:35,500
l don't want
your counterfeit notes, Ajghar!

902
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:38,625
l want your
beautiful daughter, Sonia.

903
02:01:38,625 --> 02:01:44,125
Don't exceed your limits, Aakash!

904
02:01:45,833 --> 02:01:50,042
Father, by now l know your status!

905
02:01:50,042 --> 02:01:53,833
You are a killer,
traitor and a smuggler...

906
02:01:53,833 --> 02:01:57,291
and l hate you after
knowing the truth about you!

907
02:01:57,291 --> 02:02:00,625
Shut up! Even you
are influenced by them?

908
02:02:00,625 --> 02:02:05,875
Ajghar, stop this pretense.
Don't you want this dye?

909
02:02:05,875 --> 02:02:08,583
Take it!

910
02:02:27,959 --> 02:02:30,875
You blew off my wealth!

911
02:02:30,875 --> 02:02:33,959
Shoot the rogue!

912
02:02:34,042 --> 02:02:39,583
No, don't do that or
l will shoot your daughter!

913
02:02:40,708 --> 02:02:44,000
My girlfriend, Sonia!

914
02:02:44,875 --> 02:02:49,084
Nobody will shoot.
Nothing should happen to her!

915
02:02:49,084 --> 02:02:53,084
Shut up! Or l will take you along.
So, Ajghar...

916
02:02:53,084 --> 02:02:56,625
l will take your leave.
l am taking my would be bride along...

917
02:02:56,625 --> 02:03:01,458
and we will come after our marriage
to seek your blessings.

918
02:03:03,959 --> 02:03:06,667
My girlfriend!

919
02:03:17,625 --> 02:03:22,542
l don't know whether l had the right
to get you here this way!

920
02:03:22,542 --> 02:03:29,708
Frankly speaking, l have done
the mistake of abducting you.

921
02:03:30,917 --> 02:03:36,250
But on the other hand, l've released
my lover from the hands of a traitor!

922
02:03:37,959 --> 02:03:43,417
Whether this is right or wrong,
you have to decide.

923
02:03:43,959 --> 02:03:46,166
l am ashamed that...

924
02:03:46,166 --> 02:03:51,000
my criminal father and brother
poisoned your lives.

925
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:56,625
l have no regrets of being
separated from such a father.

926
02:03:56,625 --> 02:04:01,583
And if l ever miss him, l'll remember
his atrocities and control myself.

927
02:04:02,917 --> 02:04:07,083
The decision lies in your hands,
not mine...

928
02:04:07,083 --> 02:04:10,750
will you accept me?

929
02:04:14,166 --> 02:04:18,667
l have given my heart to you since
the day l saw you for the first time!

930
02:04:22,542 --> 02:04:27,667
Mr. Ajghar, they may be in any
corner of the world, l'll find them.

931
02:04:28,959 --> 02:04:33,583
And l'll give them such a punishment
that they'll never dare to repeat it.

932
02:04:34,041 --> 02:04:38,208
lnspector, we are respectable people
and this news should not spread...

933
02:04:38,208 --> 02:04:40,625
that's our only request to you.

934
02:04:40,625 --> 02:04:46,500
We request you that we two will also
come with you in search of Sonia.

935
02:04:47,542 --> 02:04:52,291
lnspector, our dignity
is in your hands!

936
02:04:52,291 --> 02:04:59,041
lt shouldn't be, here we are crying
& there they are misbehaving with her!

937
02:11:34,750 --> 02:11:38,542
Brother, you?!

938
02:11:42,625 --> 02:11:45,042
Quiet or l will kill you!

939
02:11:45,042 --> 02:11:49,833
l made a very big mistake
by giving you'll 48 hours.

940
02:11:49,833 --> 02:11:54,500
Now you will be imprisoned
for 48 years.

941
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:58,083
- What is my crime?
- Don't act innocent!

942
02:11:58,083 --> 02:12:03,250
You abducted Ajghar Jorhat's daughter
and you are asking what your crime is?

943
02:12:04,833 --> 02:12:09,791
- Sir, take a look! - lnspector,
this rogue has molested her.

944
02:12:10,083 --> 02:12:14,708
Her this state is a proof enough!

945
02:12:14,708 --> 02:12:18,167
This is utter nonsense!
They are accusing me.

946
02:12:18,167 --> 02:12:20,083
Sonia and l are in love.

947
02:12:20,083 --> 02:12:24,708
Love and friendship are not meant
for cheats like you!

948
02:12:27,334 --> 02:12:32,083
You will surely punished
for this act. Come with me.

949
02:12:38,708 --> 02:12:43,541
Shameless girl! You want to
tarnish your father's reputation?

950
02:12:43,541 --> 02:12:47,750
My daughter cannot be in love
with that ruffian!

951
02:12:47,750 --> 02:12:51,917
He has come here to challenge me
and now is behind bars!

952
02:12:53,541 --> 02:12:57,625
lf you tell the police
a word against me then...

953
02:12:57,625 --> 02:13:03,083
he will surely die but
l will kill you too!

954
02:13:09,833 --> 02:13:15,583
- What evidence can we get here?
- Ajghar Jorhat smuggles from here.

955
02:13:23,167 --> 02:13:27,167
ln the 48 hours l gave you, the
first crime you committed was...

956
02:13:27,167 --> 02:13:30,209
that you abducted a girl
from a decent family.

957
02:13:31,833 --> 02:13:36,791
Your next crime is that you entered
this dock without permission.

958
02:13:37,042 --> 02:13:40,750
One molested a girl,
what have you come here for?

959
02:13:40,750 --> 02:13:43,833
l have come here to find evidence.

960
02:13:43,833 --> 02:13:47,209
And you don't understand
the way you are being cheated.

961
02:13:47,209 --> 02:13:51,958
l understand that l am being
cheated by you both!

962
02:13:51,958 --> 02:13:55,625
Your game is over, Prabhat!
Come with me.

963
02:13:55,625 --> 02:14:00,334
Come with me to the police station.
Don't compel me!

964
02:15:41,292 --> 02:15:43,666
Stop this fight!

965
02:15:43,666 --> 02:15:46,416
You have made the lives miserable
for the respectable people here.

966
02:15:46,416 --> 02:15:51,375
lts really very shameful. You were
fine amidst those rocks, Prabhat!

967
02:15:51,375 --> 02:15:55,042
You aren't aware that the police
here has been instigated against us.

968
02:15:55,042 --> 02:15:59,708
l have all the news.
You have harassed the Kenya police.

969
02:16:01,292 --> 02:16:04,500
l think you aren't abiding
to your duty...

970
02:16:04,500 --> 02:16:08,750
infact, you are avenging
your personal enmity!

971
02:16:08,750 --> 02:16:14,500
Now l understand your real
intentions of coming here.

972
02:16:15,416 --> 02:16:19,292
What are you saying? You'll were
the one who sent me here and now...

973
02:16:19,292 --> 02:16:23,792
l made a very big mistake,
surrender yourself to this inspector.

974
02:16:48,084 --> 02:16:55,000
Renuka, you have betrayed my love
and sentiments by supporting them.

975
02:16:56,375 --> 02:17:02,209
You supported such people who acted
as friends and asked for a favour...

976
02:17:02,375 --> 02:17:04,959
to prove themselves innocent.

977
02:17:04,959 --> 02:17:09,500
Forget doing that, they have
also tarnished my image...

978
02:17:10,291 --> 02:17:14,375
And have put our
motherland's name to shame!

979
02:17:14,375 --> 02:17:18,375
From today, we both part our ways!

980
02:17:18,375 --> 02:17:22,667
Listen to me, Mr. Surya Pratap! l'll
not plead for the sake of my relation.

981
02:17:23,708 --> 02:17:28,042
All l want to say is that
you have misunderstood us.

982
02:17:28,042 --> 02:17:32,416
But when you'll learn the truth,
you will repent a lot.

983
02:17:37,167 --> 02:17:40,291
Our enemy has succeed
in their mission.

984
02:17:40,291 --> 02:17:44,833
They have sown the seeds of hatred
and enmity against us in his heart.

985
02:17:46,959 --> 02:17:50,084
We have lost, Renuka!

986
02:17:50,084 --> 02:17:56,250
lnspite of this defeat,
l cannot forget Sunaina.

987
02:17:56,458 --> 02:18:00,416
l am sorry to say that inspite of
our presence, this incident occurred.

988
02:18:00,416 --> 02:18:04,291
Why are you apologizing? lnfact,
l am the one who is ashamed.

989
02:18:04,291 --> 02:18:09,084
l sent Prabhat here for some
other work and look what he did.

990
02:18:09,084 --> 02:18:14,416
Frankly speaking,
none of you are at fault.

991
02:18:14,416 --> 02:18:19,792
Just keep in mind that you have to
send them back to lndia.

992
02:18:21,959 --> 02:18:24,416
l will arrange to
send them back right away.

993
02:18:24,416 --> 02:18:29,167
Come son, let us thank that inspector
who saved my daughter's life.

994
02:18:30,333 --> 02:18:33,208
Sure, father!

995
02:18:33,875 --> 02:18:36,959
Mr Surya Pratap,
l am very thankful to you...

996
02:18:36,959 --> 02:18:40,875
for saving my daughter
from those hooligans.

997
02:18:40,875 --> 02:18:45,500
l'll put in a word to the
Commissioner regarding your promotion.

998
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:50,542
lnspector, its because of you
that my sister is alive today.

999
02:18:51,084 --> 02:18:53,542
lnspector, please give us
also a chance to serve you.

1000
02:18:53,542 --> 02:18:57,084
Thank you.
Whatever l did was my duty.

1001
02:18:57,084 --> 02:19:00,917
lt was a prestige issue
for the Kenya police.

1002
02:19:05,625 --> 02:19:08,583
Thank you. Have a nice day!

1003
02:19:09,708 --> 02:19:15,166
- What happened?
- He killed my mother.

1004
02:19:16,834 --> 02:19:20,834
- He killed my mother!
- Who killed your mother?

1005
02:19:20,834 --> 02:19:23,667
That man who sat in the car.

1006
02:19:30,375 --> 02:19:35,084
- What happened, child?...You?!
- You have made a big mistake.

1007
02:19:35,084 --> 02:19:39,084
- What mistake?
- The ones you should arrest...

1008
02:19:39,084 --> 02:19:40,875
you are joining hands with them!

1009
02:19:40,875 --> 02:19:44,708
And the ones you should support,
you have arrested them.

1010
02:19:44,708 --> 02:19:47,208
- And are sending them back to
lndia. - What are you trying to say?

1011
02:19:47,208 --> 02:19:51,084
Sunaina has identified
your wife's killer.

1012
02:19:51,084 --> 02:19:55,708
- What, who is he?
- Ajghar Jorhat's son, Raj Nag!

1013
02:19:55,708 --> 02:19:58,875
He raped my sister
and killed her husband.

1014
02:19:58,875 --> 02:20:03,084
Arrest them, father.
They have killed my mother.

1015
02:20:03,084 --> 02:20:08,417
For Sunaina's sake, stop
Aakash and Prabhat from leaving.

1016
02:20:13,042 --> 02:20:16,291
As per the law of Kenya, l would
definitely punish you'll...

1017
02:20:16,291 --> 02:20:20,500
but as per him, only the lndian law
can give you a suitable punishment.

1018
02:20:21,083 --> 02:20:26,375
And the punishment that
will be conferred upon Aakash...

1019
02:20:26,375 --> 02:20:32,333
you will not get less than that,
ex inspector, Prabhat!

1020
02:20:35,291 --> 02:20:38,875
Now l know why you are taking me
back to lndia.

1021
02:20:38,875 --> 02:20:41,375
lnspite of knowing a lot,
l could not understand it clearly.

1022
02:20:41,375 --> 02:20:43,375
But today l am very clear.

1023
02:20:43,375 --> 02:20:51,709
Then by now, you even know the reason
for the failure of your mission.

1024
02:20:55,375 --> 02:21:00,333
l don't understand
what you'll have understood!

1025
02:21:36,417 --> 02:21:39,875
Thank you very much for your
co-operation, Commissioner.

1026
02:21:39,875 --> 02:21:42,625
Sir, where are inspector Prabhat
and Aakash Bhardhwaj?

1027
02:21:42,625 --> 02:21:44,834
They have been sent to the airport
with the police escort.

1028
02:21:44,834 --> 02:21:48,542
lts very important to stop them.
We have been cheated, sir!

1029
02:21:48,542 --> 02:21:52,041
The crooks are not Aakash and
Prabhat, its someone else.

1030
02:21:52,041 --> 02:21:56,041
l'll come back and explain,
at the moment l have to stop them.

1031
02:21:56,834 --> 02:22:00,291
Your inspector seems to be
in a great hurry.

1032
02:22:00,291 --> 02:22:05,458
ln haste, l hope he doesn't do
something for which he'll repent.

1033
02:23:48,500 --> 02:23:51,417
Stop!

1034
02:23:57,208 --> 02:24:00,292
Stop!

1035
02:24:19,833 --> 02:24:24,333
l misunderstood you'll!

1036
02:24:25,417 --> 02:24:30,750
My friends, l cannot
even apologize to you'll.

1037
02:24:30,750 --> 02:24:37,709
But l promise, l will complete
your unfinished mission.

1038
02:24:41,083 --> 02:24:42,958
Hello, please pay attention.

1039
02:24:42,958 --> 02:24:47,500
Now you can unfasten
your seat belts.

1040
02:24:47,500 --> 02:24:50,625
We welcome the passengers going to
Mumbai on this plane.

1041
02:24:50,625 --> 02:24:55,625
And we hope that your flight
will be comfortable.

1042
02:24:55,625 --> 02:24:59,875
Captain Bakshi and inspector Balbir
will be there to help you.

1043
02:24:59,875 --> 02:25:04,125
The distance from here to Mumbai is
5 hours and 30 minutes. Thank you!

1044
02:25:05,417 --> 02:25:09,791
But Captain Bakshi and
inspector Balbir regret to announce...

1045
02:25:12,292 --> 02:25:16,875
that you won't reach Mumbai but
will die within half an hour!

1046
02:25:16,875 --> 02:25:22,375
This time bomb is being fit
to help you in your final journey.

1047
02:25:23,542 --> 02:25:28,791
We will reach down through the
parachute and inform your family...

1048
02:25:30,292 --> 02:25:33,292
Remove the keys, Aakash!

1049
02:25:33,292 --> 02:25:36,000
Here it is!

1050
02:26:37,500 --> 02:26:40,750
Now inspector Prabhat and Aakash
regret to inform you that...

1051
02:26:40,750 --> 02:26:44,625
in next five minutes,
you will reach hell!

1052
02:26:44,625 --> 02:26:49,125
We'll go down through the parachute
and inform your family of your death.

1053
02:26:49,958 --> 02:26:53,459
Here is your firecracker!

1054
02:27:02,708 --> 02:27:07,083
- l will notjump! - What happened?
- l have not even jumped in a pool.

1055
02:27:07,083 --> 02:27:11,417
lf you don'tjump, the bomb
will explode and we both will die.

1056
02:27:11,833 --> 02:27:14,417
Save me!

1057
02:28:54,542 --> 02:28:57,542
Don't move, inspector!

1058
02:29:02,917 --> 02:29:08,292
l know your disgusting reality!

1059
02:29:09,208 --> 02:29:13,083
Your act of modesty is over!

1060
02:29:13,083 --> 02:29:18,042
lf l was not a police officer, l
would shoot you so many times...

1061
02:29:19,083 --> 02:29:23,791
that you would never again dare to
speak about patriotism or decency!

1062
02:29:24,083 --> 02:29:27,917
Don't you dare move ahead!

1063
02:29:27,958 --> 02:29:32,958
lnspector, you have
misunderstood me.

1064
02:29:32,958 --> 02:29:37,917
- l have not harmed you in any way!
- You didn't?

1065
02:29:37,917 --> 02:29:44,500
Because of your son's evil deeds,
my wife was killed!

1066
02:29:46,083 --> 02:29:50,875
My innocent daughter
lost her mental balance!

1067
02:29:50,875 --> 02:29:55,083
l had to lose good friends like
Aakash and Prabhat!

1068
02:29:55,083 --> 02:30:01,167
Now you will be behind bars and
will long to see the outside world!

1069
02:30:02,708 --> 02:30:07,417
l shall destroy your evil empire!

1070
02:30:07,417 --> 02:30:11,708
lnspector, before destroying me,
take a look there too!

1071
02:30:19,875 --> 02:30:22,791
Throw your revolver!

1072
02:30:25,541 --> 02:30:32,042
Stop being a hero! You've lost your
wife, now you'll lose your daughter!

1073
02:30:33,375 --> 02:30:38,042
And these two women
will also lose their lives.

1074
02:30:38,042 --> 02:30:42,375
Our principle is that
whenever we make a move...

1075
02:30:46,292 --> 02:30:50,666
The way we controlled you
and got those two killed.

1076
02:30:51,042 --> 02:30:56,250
- What? - Now its your turn.

1077
02:30:59,083 --> 02:31:02,708
You betrayer!

1078
02:31:02,708 --> 02:31:05,167
You are also a part of his gang?

1079
02:31:05,167 --> 02:31:09,375
You rogue! You have tarnished the
police image, people will berate you.

1080
02:31:11,750 --> 02:31:16,875
Take this brave man and chain him up!

1081
02:31:19,875 --> 02:31:24,292
Now you handle them,
l will return back to lndia.

1082
02:31:25,292 --> 02:31:29,833
Here l am abiding my friendship,
let me handle my work there.

1083
02:31:29,833 --> 02:31:33,042
So that you work gets easier.

1084
02:31:33,042 --> 02:31:38,792
You have proven your friendship.
Even l am a good friend...

1085
02:31:39,292 --> 02:31:45,084
you don't worry, l'll give you enough
money for the rest of your life.

1086
02:31:49,416 --> 02:31:52,125
So this is
Ajghar Jorhat's reality!

1087
02:31:52,125 --> 02:31:55,292
He was cheating both the countries
at the same time.

1088
02:31:55,292 --> 02:32:00,375
And the Commissioner was
covering up his activities.

1089
02:32:04,958 --> 02:32:09,708
We will attack Ajghar Jorhat's den.
My police force will help you.

1090
02:32:10,375 --> 02:32:13,708
Sir, your police force
will not go with us.

1091
02:32:13,708 --> 02:32:17,375
Till date, you have always
misunderstood us.

1092
02:32:17,375 --> 02:32:20,416
But today, you will have
to listen to us.

1093
02:32:20,416 --> 02:32:23,416
This battle is between
Ajghar Jorhat and us.

1094
02:32:23,416 --> 02:32:28,666
And l've promised my Government
to get him back alive.

1095
02:32:29,541 --> 02:32:32,750
Alright, l will not
disapprove what you say.

1096
02:32:32,750 --> 02:32:36,750
But even l am fond of
Surya Pratap the way you'll are.

1097
02:32:36,750 --> 02:32:39,875
That is why, even l will come there
but with my own style!

1098
02:32:39,875 --> 02:32:43,875
lts necessary he knows that
you both are alive.

1099
02:32:43,875 --> 02:32:49,375
You don't worry, sir. We know of
a way to give him that news.

1100
02:33:27,625 --> 02:33:33,625
Renuka, look!
This is Prabhat's mouth organ.

1101
02:33:33,875 --> 02:33:39,333
That means Prabhat
and Aakash are alive!

1102
02:33:43,833 --> 02:33:46,375
What is the further news?

1103
02:33:46,375 --> 02:33:52,291
Nobody can now stop the storm
that will strike Ajghar's life!

1104
02:33:55,750 --> 02:33:58,750
Storm!

1105
02:41:39,292 --> 02:41:44,584
Brave, honest, fearless, patriot...

1106
02:41:45,375 --> 02:41:50,375
dangerous, the pride of Kenya
police, lnspector Surya Pratap!

1107
02:41:52,542 --> 02:41:55,667
Poor man!

1108
02:41:56,500 --> 02:41:59,375
Water!

1109
02:42:06,542 --> 02:42:09,625
Now see what we do to your father!

1110
02:42:09,625 --> 02:42:15,041
Slowly, this water will rise
and your death will be near!

1111
02:42:20,958 --> 02:42:24,667
Today my final enemy
will be perished!

1112
02:42:24,667 --> 02:42:29,667
And then l will be called
the infinite power of this world!

1113
02:45:28,625 --> 02:45:31,208
Don't move!

1114
02:45:34,958 --> 02:45:37,917
Throw your guns!

1115
02:45:39,750 --> 02:45:45,459
Don't move! Throw your guns.

1116
02:45:53,292 --> 02:45:54,958
- Leave me! - Don't scream!

1117
02:45:54,958 --> 02:46:02,375
- Turn around!
- Now all of you bend! - Me too?

1118
02:46:42,375 --> 02:46:44,917
Where did they go?

1119
02:46:45,042 --> 02:46:47,083
Leave us!

1120
02:46:47,083 --> 02:46:50,209
Search them, they shouldn't escape!

1121
02:47:35,541 --> 02:47:40,083
- Uncle, does he want to go
to the loo? - Yes, l want to!

1122
02:47:40,083 --> 02:47:44,250
- Then do it here!
- No, l'll go there. - Do it here!

1123
02:48:19,375 --> 02:48:23,541
l will kill you, inspector Prabhat!

1124
02:48:28,958 --> 02:48:31,625
l must escape or l'll be dead!

1125
02:48:31,625 --> 02:48:37,708
You always want to go there. Lets
make you forget about it forever!

1126
02:48:54,375 --> 02:48:59,000
Son, get up quickly,
