1
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:10,622
What happens to this city?
Either there is ash or smoke.

2
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:12,992
Why doesn't anyone say anything?

3
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:15,884
Why do they tolerate
this smoke quietly?

4
00:00:16,627 --> 00:00:18,485
It's the limit to tolerance.

5
00:00:19,113 --> 00:00:21,976
Let douse cigarettes and cigars.

6
00:00:22,362 --> 00:00:24,369
There is ban on smoking
on public places.

7
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:26,805
You've to pay fine for it.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,033
Neither smoking nor
let others smoking.

9
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,912
Smoking costs dearly.

10
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:39,138
Everyone desires happiness.

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,828
But at what cost?

12
00:00:44,756 --> 00:00:47,319
Smoking costs dearly.

13
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,223
Smoking is injurious
to your health..

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,776
..to your loves ones too.

15
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:02,732
You've to pay dearly for smoking.

16
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,490
Good morning, guys.
- Good morning, sir

17
00:03:17,724 --> 00:03:18,724
What's happening?

18
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,924
Sir, we're doing the lighting.

19
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:24,633
Fine, fine.

20
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:27,739
Mohit, what's up?

21
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:31,126
How did you call me today?

22
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:33,219
No, man. Shooting.

23
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:35,499
GH Mills.

24
00:03:36,604 --> 00:03:37,914
Royal Mansions.

25
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:39,579
It's a feature.

26
00:03:40,244 --> 00:03:41,124
What?

27
00:03:41,164 --> 00:03:42,164
Tonight?

28
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,094
For what?

29
00:03:44,644 --> 00:03:46,044
Narration.

30
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:49,478
Narration only?

31
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:51,964
Okay. I'll be there.

32
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:53,964
Ma'am, shot is ready.

33
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:55,524
Scene 10 by Take 1.

34
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:57,572
And...action!

35
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:20,137
What happened to Madam,
Get the water quickly.

36
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:32,884
"Where do we go?"

37
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:37,964
"Where do we go?"

38
00:04:38,953 --> 00:04:43,404
"Who will understand..."

39
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:48,844
"..the sad story of the ghosts."

40
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:53,362
"Where do we go?"

41
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:58,084
"Where do we go?"

42
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:14,604
"What's happening in
the name of progress?"

43
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:24,804
"What's happening in
the name of progress?"

44
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:29,764
"The bulldozer's
razing down our homes."

45
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,884
"Shopping malls and Multiplex.."

46
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:39,804
"..are snatching our graves."

47
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:45,364
"O Government, hear our plea."

48
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:48,964
"Where do we go?"

49
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:54,564
"Where do we go?"

50
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:10,724
"There's no one with us."

51
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:21,124
"There's no one with us."

52
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:26,084
"Ghosts have become helpless."

53
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:31,204
"We don't have the
right to vote either."

54
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:36,284
"Even the politicians shun us."

55
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:41,564
"O Government, hear our plea."

56
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:45,484
"Where do we go?"

57
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:50,764
"Where do we go?"

58
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:54,324
"Where do we go?"

59
00:06:54,684 --> 00:06:57,004
"Where do we go?"

60
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,364
"Where do we go?"

61
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:01,884
"Where do we go?"

62
00:07:02,044 --> 00:07:04,764
"Where do we go?"

63
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:11,884
What a scary structure, right?

64
00:07:12,082 --> 00:07:13,844
So old and dilapidated.

65
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:15,219
Yes.

66
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:17,924
Most of the disputed properties in
Mumbai are in the same condition.

67
00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:20,844
Aditya, Do you
remember that Ragini incident?

68
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:23,084
Yes, that ghost affair.
- Yes.

69
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:24,364
Just imagine.

70
00:07:24,626 --> 00:07:27,124
Ragini must be going
through some serious PR crises.

71
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:28,964
Why such cheap publicity?

72
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:31,163
Today's marketing mantra is..

73
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:33,764
..any publicity is good publicity.

74
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:35,084
If you want to promote your film.

75
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:36,588
And her act worked.

76
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,708
Her story was all over.

77
00:07:38,844 --> 00:07:41,868
News, TV, internet. Everywhere.

78
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:44,028
Ghost stories intrigue everyone.

79
00:07:44,108 --> 00:07:46,758
No wonder that such films
are made and run successfully.

80
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:49,428
What happened?

81
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:51,188
I really don't understand.

82
00:07:51,468 --> 00:07:54,108
In Raaz 3, Esha Gupta knows..

83
00:07:54,188 --> 00:07:55,908
..that the house she's
living in is haunted.

84
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:57,908
So why doesn't she just leave?

85
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:01,108
Tanya, if you try to find
logic in the ghost stories.

86
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,228
..then you are going to see only
ghosts at the box-office window.

87
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:07,188
And Bhootnath, Amitabh
Bachchan is a ghost..

88
00:08:07,268 --> 00:08:09,548
..who is visible to a kid,
but not Juhi Chawla.

89
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:11,628
And in the climax, even
Juhi Chawla can see him.

90
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,807
Again Logic.

91
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:15,148
It is up to the ghost to decide..

92
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,484
..who can see him and who cannot.

93
00:08:18,228 --> 00:08:20,748
Mostly ghosts are seen..

94
00:08:20,828 --> 00:08:22,508
..to those people
who are in trouble.

95
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:26,388
Or someone who create
troubles for them. Get it?

96
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:27,868
Good morning, sir.

97
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:30,388
You..
- Raju, sir.

98
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:31,708
Raju writer.

99
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:34,788
Oh yes yes.
What are you doing here?

100
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:36,628
Sir, I was here to see
location with someone...

101
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,428
I saw you here then I
thought to meet you.

102
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:40,428
That's the real job of
a struggling writer.

103
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:43,508
So, what do you want?
- Sir I want one single chance.

104
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:45,148
Sir, I've a superhit idea, sir.

105
00:08:45,188 --> 00:08:46,348
Sir, just give me one hearing.

106
00:08:46,428 --> 00:08:48,588
Sir FIMFARE, ZEE, IIFA, TOIFA,

107
00:08:48,668 --> 00:08:50,108
..Even the Lion's club
award will be yours sir.

108
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:51,388
Sir, just hear me once.

109
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:53,348
You are here also... Ok
leave from here.. Get out.

110
00:08:53,428 --> 00:08:55,908
Mr. Gupta, remember I
came to your office.

111
00:08:55,988 --> 00:08:57,588
Yes, unwanted.
- And I hugged you..

112
00:08:57,628 --> 00:08:59,268
..in your last
film's success party.

113
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:01,468
Remember, sir.
- You had crashed the gate at the party.

114
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:02,548
And gulped down the entire bottle.

115
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:04,308
Now Just get out from here,
or I'll make you regret it.

116
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:06,668
Mr. Gupta,
What else can you do with me?

117
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:08,028
I've been struggling for 5 years..

118
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:09,228
..but I couldn't get one break.

119
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:10,828
No place to stay, no food to eat.

120
00:09:10,908 --> 00:09:12,068
But no problem, sir.

121
00:09:12,148 --> 00:09:13,588
The day will come soon when..

122
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:15,668
..a lucky director
will accept my story..

123
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:18,148
..and make a
super-duper blockbuster film.

124
00:09:18,228 --> 00:09:20,428
And then it will be
your loss, sir, not mine.

125
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:21,948
Because I might be unfortunate..

126
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,068
..but I have hunger in me,
I've confidence.

127
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,348
If you're hungry, go and
have some fritters. Get out.

128
00:09:26,476 --> 00:09:29,188
I will, sir. I will eat that.

129
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,348
But remember one thing.

130
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:33,868
Those who eat fritters
during their bad phase..

131
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,268
..They will be
exorbitant at their good time.

132
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,068
Bye, sir.

133
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:45,938
I wonder how he got in here.

134
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:49,514
Filmy strugglers are
like unwanted messages.

135
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:52,952
No matter how many times you
delete them they keep coming.

136
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:54,714
It is very frustrating.

137
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:56,354
Aditya, this is Hemantbhai.

138
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:57,600
He will take us around.

139
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,794
Hi, Hemantbhai.

140
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:01,554
I am Aditya, Hi and
this is Tanya, my AD.

141
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:06,080
Which is the latest film
that you made?

142
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:09,079
No feature film yet.

143
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:11,132
No feature film yet.

144
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,161
Nice title.

145
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:14,994
Hemant, he makes commercials.

146
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:16,501
It's important
to make commercials..

147
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:18,978
..otherwise people don't like it.

148
00:10:19,594 --> 00:10:20,834
Are you casting Salman?

149
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:23,954
Hemantbhai, he wants to
say that I make ad-films.

150
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:26,912
Advertisement films.
- I see.

151
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:28,874
The things that bore you..

152
00:10:28,914 --> 00:10:30,754
..between TV serials and news.

153
00:10:30,794 --> 00:10:31,794
Frustrating.

154
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:37,554
In 1932, the workers burned
this mill down to the ground.

155
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:38,714
Frustrating.

156
00:10:38,874 --> 00:10:41,194
And from 1985 till now..

157
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:44,554
..around 50-60 films
have been shot here.

158
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:48,754
100 years ago, Gaindamal..

159
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:51,874
..built this mansion on
the plot next to his mill.

160
00:10:51,914 --> 00:10:54,914
To entertain his British guests.

161
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,554
After the Lingering doubt shoot..

162
00:10:56,634 --> 00:10:58,474
..he's been renting it
out for shootings again.

163
00:10:58,594 --> 00:11:00,114
You're the first director..

164
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:01,674
..who's come here
after that incident.

165
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,954
Otherwise it was closed
for the last one year.

166
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:05,354
No income.

167
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,114
It was frustrating.

168
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:10,634
Wow. What a mansion, Hemantbhai.
- Thank you.

169
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:13,194
I want to see every part
of this mansion and mill.

170
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:15,834
But I am here only
for half an hour.

171
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:17,536
Come, Tanya.

172
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:20,714
Well there are many rooms here.

173
00:11:20,874 --> 00:11:22,434
What do you exactly want?

174
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:24,954
We want a room and a verandah.

175
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:26,794
And if we can get the terrace,
that will be even better.

176
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:36,954
Mr. Director, here's your verandah.

177
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:38,874
And here's the terrace.

178
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:40,194
Is this what you wanted?

179
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:41,594
Wow, great.

180
00:11:41,794 --> 00:11:42,914
It's Beautiful.

181
00:11:43,714 --> 00:11:45,954
Now this is nice.

182
00:11:46,394 --> 00:11:49,634
Listen, here our actor
will swing on a chair.

183
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,150
Right here.
- Okay.

184
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:54,194
And then we'll get the
entire city in the background.

185
00:11:54,787 --> 00:11:57,394
Then the scene will look great.

186
00:11:57,754 --> 00:11:59,434
Script and storyboard
is in the laptop.

187
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:00,874
Should I switch it on?

188
00:12:01,051 --> 00:12:03,685
My dear Script is always
in the director's mind.

189
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,417
I don't need a laptop.

190
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:07,714
Once Sumit will come..

191
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,674
..then we'll
finalize our shot divisions.

192
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:10,929
Cool.

193
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,034
And before that, let's
see the entire house.

194
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:15,554
You go ahead, I'll be right there.

195
00:12:15,714 --> 00:12:19,194
Hemantbhai. These actors can
do anything for publicity.

196
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:22,314
Gupta, stop gossiping.
- No, sir.

197
00:12:22,394 --> 00:12:24,994
I was talking about Ragini's case.

198
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:27,314
She saw a ghost
during the shooting.

199
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:32,434
I think these rumors are true.

200
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,434
It's an old mansion.

201
00:12:34,594 --> 00:12:36,234
It has to be infested by ghosts.

202
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:37,434
Has to be?

203
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:38,554
It is.

204
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:42,074
Don't smoke.

205
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:45,434
Don't smoke.

206
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,514
Tanya.

207
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:48,194
Coming.

208
00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:53,714
Listen, smoke but be around.

209
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,145
If you smoke alone..

210
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:56,954
..the ghost will snatch
your cigarette.

211
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,987
What rubbish?
- Ask them.

212
00:13:02,674 --> 00:13:05,025
This is the most
beautiful room of the mansion.

213
00:13:05,594 --> 00:13:07,838
Wow, Hemantbhai. This is great.

214
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:10,474
There's a bar and a stage too.

215
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:12,194
Yes Beautiful.

216
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:14,714
So many musical instruments.
- Exactly.

217
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:16,794
Is this a hall or a music room?

218
00:13:16,986 --> 00:13:18,994
This is where the
entertainment would take place.

219
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:20,954
Famous Dancers performed here.

220
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,834
Renowned singers like
Ustad Allauddin Khan..

221
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:26,554
..Baiju Bawra sir
harmonized this place.

222
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:35,754
Hemantbhai.

223
00:13:38,674 --> 00:13:41,674
By the way, is this
mansion really haunted?

224
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:43,154
Yes, it is.

225
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,474
Then it must have
scary stories as well.

226
00:13:47,714 --> 00:13:50,154
This house has an unusual past.

227
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,754
They say this house is cursed.

228
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:57,714
After Gaindamal murdered by
the hands of the Mill workers..

229
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:02,674
..Gaindamal's soul roam
around here in the mansion.

230
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,634
Jesus!

231
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,874
Aditya, change your ringtone.
- Aditya, sir.

232
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,394
What Aditya sir..
It's was scary.

233
00:14:08,618 --> 00:14:09,674
Yes, Sumit Da. Yes.

234
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:11,803
Yes, I can hear.

235
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:14,713
What, you're stuck?

236
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:18,393
Oh, rail blockage
against land acquisition.

237
00:14:18,753 --> 00:14:19,873
So what will we do now?

238
00:14:20,513 --> 00:14:22,113
No, the shoot is
day after tomorrow.

239
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:23,827
No, it's not possible tomorrow.

240
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:25,633
I've an important meeting tomorrow.

241
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:26,773
Yes.

242
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,053
Fine, Ok! let me talk to Hemant.

243
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:31,333
I'll try to get his permission.

244
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:32,413
Okay.

245
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:35,173
No.

246
00:14:35,213 --> 00:14:36,213
I won't stay.

247
00:14:36,253 --> 00:14:37,493
I won't stay back.

248
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:40,893
Today, There's a hearing in
the High Court for Royal Mansion.

249
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:43,053
The great grandsons of Gaindamal..

250
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,613
..are fighting in the
court for this property.

251
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,213
I've to go with them.

252
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:48,653
It's frustrating.

253
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,998
Hemant, leave the
keys with the watchman.

254
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:54,613
Who would come to a house
that's haunted by ghosts.

255
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,614
I did appoint one...but
the ghosts drove him away.

256
00:14:57,693 --> 00:14:58,933
What are you saying?

257
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:00,573
The entire house is
filled with antiques.

258
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:02,333
And everything must be expensive.

259
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:04,013
Yes, they say that..

260
00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:06,573
..there's a huge treasure
buried under this house too.

261
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:08,053
You mean hidden treasure.

262
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:12,333
People have seen golden
coins of the British era.

263
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:14,093
That's why I don't
give the keys to anyone.

264
00:15:14,173 --> 00:15:16,133
Hemantbhai. Hemantbhai.
- No, no.

265
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:17,893
Have faith, I'll bring the keys.

266
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:19,853
Tanya, please.
- Hemantbhai, please.

267
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:21,893
Please, please, please, let it be.

268
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:22,973
Please.

269
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:25,333
Please is what gets us in the end.

270
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,093
Fine.

271
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:29,253
Please. Here are the keys.

272
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,453
Thank you so much.
- Thank you very much.

273
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:34,013
Thank you so much, Hemantbhai.

274
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,133
Thank you.

275
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:40,293
Really, Tanya.

276
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:44,253
Your magical embrace
cast a spell on Hemantbhai.

277
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,253
Come on.
I hugged him out of affection.

278
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,333
Yes, right.

279
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,133
Sir, what will we
do for next two hours?

280
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:51,373
I will have to wait for Sumit Da.

281
00:15:51,573 --> 00:15:53,533
I've to discuss the
shot divisions with him.

282
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,813
I suggest that you two
go to the police station.

283
00:15:57,013 --> 00:16:00,093
And get the permissions
for next week's shoot.

284
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:01,133
That's a good idea.

285
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:03,413
Yeah, even I've to meet
with the costume dada, so..

286
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,173
Great. You guys get going then.

287
00:16:05,253 --> 00:16:06,413
Leave the keys with me.

288
00:16:06,493 --> 00:16:07,493
Okay.

289
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,773
Will you manage it alone?
- Yes.

290
00:16:10,438 --> 00:16:11,720
Camera, laptop.

291
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,773
Thank you.
- Take care.

292
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:13,653
Yes, I will.

293
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:15,333
Bye, sir.
- Bye, Gupta.

294
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:05,933
Sir.
- Who is it? Who is it?

295
00:18:06,223 --> 00:18:07,853
Sir, it's me. Raju writer, sir.

296
00:18:08,374 --> 00:18:10,149
You?
You're back again.

297
00:18:10,955 --> 00:18:11,955
What do you want now?

298
00:18:12,035 --> 00:18:13,275
Sir, neither money nor credit.

299
00:18:13,515 --> 00:18:14,795
I just need a break.

300
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:18,275
Oh God! You don't need a break
But I really need one from you.

301
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:20,035
That's exactly what
I want to give, sir.

302
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:22,196
I want to give you a break
to make a film on my story.

303
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:23,635
I am just joking, sir.

304
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:25,195
Sir, please hear my story once.

305
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:26,835
Sir, I've done my research here..

306
00:18:26,915 --> 00:18:28,355
..and written a story
about this place.

307
00:18:28,435 --> 00:18:30,355
My friend,
I've told you many times..

308
00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:32,315
..I've no interest
in hearing your story.

309
00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:34,195
Sir, but I am interested
in telling you.

310
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:36,595
FIMFARE, ZEE, IIFA, TOIFA,

311
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:38,235
Even the Lion's club
award will be yours sir.

312
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,915
Thank you very much for the awards.

313
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:42,515
But dude, I don't
want to hear your story.

314
00:18:42,643 --> 00:18:44,995
Because I've got my own
story for my first film.

315
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:46,315
Hold on, sir.

316
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:48,984
You wrote a story without me.

317
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:52,035
Without me?

318
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:53,435
Sorry.

319
00:18:53,475 --> 00:18:54,595
Sir, just joking.

320
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,995
By the way, what's the genre?

321
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:57,635
I mean what kind of a film is it?

322
00:18:57,675 --> 00:18:59,555
Action? Social? Thriller? Horror?

323
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:00,955
Or one of those
intellectual art films..

324
00:19:01,035 --> 00:19:02,635
..with a strong message.

325
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:03,835
It's not like that.

326
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:06,275
But what do you know about these
intellectual art-house movies?

327
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,355
Sir, I may look like a tramp..

328
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:10,275
..but tramp only get the triumph.

329
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:12,803
By the way, I am MA in Literature
from Allahabad University.

330
00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:14,676
And member of the
Cineclub in Allahabad.

331
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:17,035
Fellini, Truffaut, Bergman..

332
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,715
..and our very own Satyajit Ray,
Gurudutt, Shantaram..

333
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:22,964
..made such great films.

334
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:24,915
I guess you're a big movie buff.

335
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,090
Very big sir.

336
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:27,289
Big one?

337
00:19:27,512 --> 00:19:29,235
Okay, how about the
contemporary film-makers?

338
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:31,803
Danny Boyle, Ang Lee,
Christopher Nolan..

339
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:32,911
..have you seen their work?

340
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:34,071
Just tell me the movie name, sir..

341
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:35,831
..I can tell you the entire
screenplay, with dialogues.

342
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:36,991
No, let it be.

343
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:38,271
Sir. Can I say something?

344
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:41,231
Stop making these ad-films.
- Why is that?

345
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:43,871
If a young talent like you do
the slavery to this consumerism.

346
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,751
And sell these soaps and
toothpaste, doesn't look nice.

347
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:47,871
Make a feature film.

348
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:49,511
And say whatever you want.

349
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,422
Sir, there's great fun in
making a feature film, sir.

350
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:53,911
But you just mentioned Satyajit Ray.
- Yes, sir.

351
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:55,871
Even he made ad-films first.

352
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:58,111
And if we don't sell
these soaps and toothpaste..

353
00:19:58,151 --> 00:19:59,551
..then what will we eat?

354
00:19:59,711 --> 00:20:02,231
And anyway, who will
finance my independent film?

355
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,951
Corporates are only interested
in the number game and stars.

356
00:20:05,031 --> 00:20:06,351
That's true, sir.

357
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:08,671
But, are you interested
in making a feature film?

358
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,311
Definitely.

359
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:12,391
In fact, I also have
a story in my mind.

360
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:13,911
Hot Haryanvi.

361
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:16,391
And for that I'm
also meeting a producer.

362
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:18,231
Well, you didn't hear my story..

363
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:20,101
..but I will definitely
hear your story.

364
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:23,231
Don't worry, I won't leak it out.

365
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:25,111
I can also sign an NDA for you.

366
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:26,751
Non Disclosure Agreement.

367
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:35,635
So the basic story is about a boy..

368
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,151
..who plays in a band.

369
00:20:37,191 --> 00:20:38,281
Marriage band?

370
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:40,229
No.

371
00:20:40,537 --> 00:20:41,701
Music band. Musical group.

372
00:20:41,804 --> 00:20:43,395
I see. Like beetles, etcetera.

373
00:20:43,524 --> 00:20:44,524
Something like that.

374
00:20:44,574 --> 00:20:46,869
But they only play Haryanvi music.
- Oh!

375
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:48,669
Haryanvi music?

376
00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:51,149
Hard to digest,
but sounds interesting.

377
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:52,589
Next, sir. Next.

378
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,029
The parents of this boy..

379
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:58,109
..want to fulfill
their dreams through him.

380
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:01,389
They want their son
to become a musician.

381
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:02,909
But the son knows..

382
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:05,749
..he can never fulfill
his parent's dreams.

383
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:07,549
Because he's a bad musician.

384
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:10,015
He doesn't have the
talent to compose songs.

385
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:11,568
He is out of tune.

386
00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:14,559
He's stuck in a
strange non-creative limbo.

387
00:21:14,949 --> 00:21:16,987
He also has a girlfriend
who loves him.

388
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:19,956
But the boy hates
love and affection.

389
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:22,629
Same old wine in a new bottle.

390
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:24,429
You said something?
- No, sir. Nothing.

391
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:26,509
Sir, what happens in the end?

392
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:28,149
That's the problem.

393
00:21:28,749 --> 00:21:31,024
I just can't figure out
what the end should be.

394
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:35,154
I have characters,
plot points, crises..

395
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:37,949
..cinematic moments,
but I can't think of..

396
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:39,709
..what the resolution should be.

397
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:41,869
The problem is by tomorrow..

398
00:21:41,949 --> 00:21:44,137
..I've to work out
the end at any cost.

399
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:47,389
Sir, if you don't mind
can I say something?

400
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:48,269
No, go ahead.

401
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:50,686
Sir, throw your
story in the dustbin.

402
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:53,269
What?

403
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:54,804
Sir, your story's got no impact.

404
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,629
This was just the synopsis.

405
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:01,269
When I tell you scene by scene
you'll realize the real impact.

406
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:03,909
Sir Raju writer is my name.
Writing is my job.

407
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,189
By hearing 2 minutes of the story..

408
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:07,749
I can imagine the entire screenplay
and know what's going to happen next.

409
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,389
Really?
- Sir, you felt bad.

410
00:22:09,469 --> 00:22:11,069
No, sir. - That's why
you're leaving me in the middle.

411
00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:12,069
I didn't feel bad,

412
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:13,629
Sir, I heard your boring story..

413
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,473
..so you got to hear
my interesting story.

414
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,269
You mean your story's
better than mine.

415
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:23,469
Sir, don't try to
compare a diamond with a stone.

416
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:25,549
I see.
- Yes, sir.

417
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:27,949
If you make a film on my story..
- I know, I know.

418
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:30,069
Filmfare,
Screen, Zee, IIFA, TOIFA..

419
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,469
..we'll even bag
the Lions Club award.

420
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:32,780
Right?
- Yes, sir.

421
00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:36,509
What are you?
- The best, sir.

422
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:40,749
Fine, you win I lose.

423
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:42,429
Sir, I love you.
- What are you doing?

424
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:43,879
I love you.
- Stay away.

425
00:22:44,334 --> 00:22:45,349
Come on, tell me your story.

426
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,530
Okay, sir.

427
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:49,349
So, we begin our
story from a smoke.

428
00:22:49,697 --> 00:22:50,697
Smoke?
- Yes.

429
00:22:50,751 --> 00:22:53,069
Sir, the signing.
- Oh, you want money already.

430
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:54,549
Sir, cigarette.

431
00:22:55,897 --> 00:22:56,704
Yes.

432
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:58,475
Here you go.
- Yes, sir.

433
00:22:58,975 --> 00:23:01,109
Now light it.

434
00:23:02,037 --> 00:23:03,229
Take a puff.

435
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,149
There'll be smoke all around.

436
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,829
And with the smoke
the story starts.

437
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:13,189
Sir, the old mills and buildings..

438
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:15,349
..are disappearing from the city.

439
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:17,949
From the mills between
Lower Parel and Mahalaxmi..

440
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:20,256
..to the old house
between Bandra and Colaba..

441
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:22,549
..were devoured by the
wind of development.

442
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,709
From British rule to Indian rule.

443
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:27,109
And now it feels like we're
living in the promoter's rule.

444
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:28,989
Old structures are
being razed down..

445
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:30,789
..to build 7 star hotels.

446
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:32,429
New condominiums are
being built every day.

447
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:34,589
Multiplexes, shopping malls.

448
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,029
By the grace of God..

449
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:37,869
..and some new Municipal rules..

450
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:40,549
..heritage and disputed
properties are still intact.

451
00:23:40,829 --> 00:23:42,389
But they are few in numbers.

452
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:44,189
The question is..

453
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:46,869
..who's most bothered by
the city's development?

454
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:47,949
Mumbaikars.

455
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:50,229
I mean, all this is
forcing a common Mumbaikar..

456
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:51,989
..to leave the city and go out.

457
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:53,389
No, sir.
That problem was always there..

458
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:54,909
..and it will always be there.

459
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,494
But the demolition
of mills and houses..

460
00:23:57,949 --> 00:23:59,589
..has put Mumbai's
spirit in danger.

461
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:00,709
Spirit?

462
00:24:00,846 --> 00:24:03,269
Oh, I see. You mean the Mumbai spirit?
- No, sir.

463
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:04,389
Not that spirit.

464
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:06,757
By spirit I mean ghosts, souls.

465
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:09,869
Dead people.

466
00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:16,269
Sir, they're in a terrible state.

467
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,109
They are ruined.

468
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,189
These old houses and mills..

469
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,709
..used to be their den.

470
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:24,029
You can also call it
their dwelling place.

471
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:27,069
And now those simple,
nave ghosts..

472
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:29,189
..are facing a big crises.

473
00:24:29,682 --> 00:24:31,598
They are wandering from
one place to another..

474
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:32,989
..like crazy homeless souls.

475
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:36,029
And the few homes that are left
are not enough for all of them.

476
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:38,028
Because their population is more
than the number of homes.

477
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,109
And sir, the worst part is..

478
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:41,909
..no one's paying
attention to the ghost community..

479
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:43,509
..during their time of crises.

480
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:45,909
The government isn't
introducing any scheme..

481
00:24:45,949 --> 00:24:47,509
..to resettle them.

482
00:24:47,749 --> 00:24:50,589
No one's starting any movement.

483
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,149
Ruling party, opposition party,
civil societies..

484
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:55,589
..and even the media
isn't ready to help them..

485
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:57,469
Because their viewership
doesn't depend on ghosts.

486
00:24:57,613 --> 00:24:58,909
Exactly, sir. You're on the mark.

487
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:01,229
Because they are
neither consumers nor voters.

488
00:25:01,656 --> 00:25:02,656
Very good.

489
00:25:03,123 --> 00:25:05,587
I can sense political
satire in your story.

490
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:08,281
But there shouldn't be any
lecture or long speeches..

491
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:10,561
..to deliver a social message.

492
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:12,041
I like films which has layers.

493
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:13,321
Something that has ups and downs.

494
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:15,001
Sir, you'll find
layers after layers..

495
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:16,681
..in Raju Writer's story.

496
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:18,521
With all commercial ingredients.

497
00:25:18,624 --> 00:25:21,321
Crime, passion, thrill, music,
romance, dance.

498
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:22,801
After all, these things make..

499
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:25,521
..a great Indian pot boiler.

500
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:27,681
Fine, let's listen.

501
00:25:27,982 --> 00:25:30,241
We'll start our story
with the character of..

502
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,521
..Raibahadur Mr. Gendamal Hemraj.

503
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:35,241
Isn't he the same person
Hemant was talking about?

504
00:25:35,321 --> 00:25:38,521
Yes, sir. In return of
selling his mills to the British..

505
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:41,081
..he got the title of
Raibahardur from the British.

506
00:25:41,161 --> 00:25:44,001
And on that occasion, there's
a celebration in the mansion.

507
00:25:44,321 --> 00:25:45,321
Cheers!

508
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:47,081
Cheers!

509
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:52,201
On one side there
were celebrations..

510
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:54,841
..and on the other,
the mill workers..

511
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,601
..were fuming with hatred.

512
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:58,574
Right after taking over the mills..

513
00:25:58,614 --> 00:26:00,681
..the Britishers cut
down their salary and wages.

514
00:26:00,841 --> 00:26:01,961
And the Mill Worker Unions..

515
00:26:02,223 --> 00:26:03,921
..staged a strike
against this cruelty.

516
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:05,921
Gendamal was supporting
the Britishers..

517
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:08,561
..and wasn't ready to bow before
the demands of the workers.

518
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:09,961
Down with..
- Gendamal!

519
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,481
Down with..
- Gendamal!

520
00:26:11,561 --> 00:26:12,585
Down with..
- Gendamal!

521
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:17,241
The workers were gripped
with starvation and sickness.

522
00:26:17,698 --> 00:26:21,315
And in a fit of rage they
burnt the mill down to ashes.

523
00:26:25,361 --> 00:26:26,561
Save me!

524
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:35,601
After his death,
Raibahadur Gendamal..

525
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:38,041
..decided to stay in this mansion..

526
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:40,361
..instead of wandering in the mill.

527
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:50,481
Sir, other than the Royal mansion
there was another mansion in the city.

528
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:51,641
Imperial Palace.

529
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:53,921
Before India got freedom..

530
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:56,281
..the Governor
General Ramsay lived in it.

531
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,561
Indian revolutionaries were..

532
00:26:58,641 --> 00:26:59,961
..thirsty for British blood.

533
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:03,881
And one day they attacked
Ramsay sir when he was alone.

534
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:05,561
Vande Mataram!

535
00:27:07,521 --> 00:27:09,681
And before India achieved freedom..

536
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:12,721
..Ramsay's soul was
liberated from his body.

537
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:16,513
Ramsay's ghost resided
comfortably in the Imperial Palace.

538
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:18,761
But this luxury lasted
only for a few days.

539
00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:20,321
Because right after
the independence..

540
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:21,848
..the Indian
government sanctioned an order..

541
00:27:21,888 --> 00:27:23,401
..to convert that
place into a library.

542
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:26,081
Now Ramsay liked to read books.

543
00:27:26,214 --> 00:27:29,961
But his ghost detested books,
magazines and newspapers.

544
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:32,681
So Ramsay was in a dilemma.

545
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:34,201
Mr. Booth!

546
00:27:34,856 --> 00:27:36,321
Mr. Booth!

547
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,081
And he met his
once-upon-a-time boss, Mr. Booth..

548
00:27:41,281 --> 00:27:43,481
..and made him call Gendamal..

549
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:46,641
..and get him a place
in the Royal mansion.

550
00:27:47,092 --> 00:27:48,601
I've a friend, Ramsay.

551
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:50,161
He just passed away.

552
00:27:50,297 --> 00:27:51,660
I need a place for him.

553
00:27:54,645 --> 00:27:57,061
Excuse me, are you Raibahadur?

554
00:27:57,101 --> 00:27:58,281
Depends who's asking?

555
00:27:58,603 --> 00:28:00,603
I am Governor general Ramsay.

556
00:28:01,803 --> 00:28:03,323
You are Governor general Ramsay.

557
00:28:03,403 --> 00:28:05,589
Than I am Raibahadur
Gendamal Hemraj.

558
00:28:06,403 --> 00:28:08,883
Mr. Booth has
recommended your name.

559
00:28:08,963 --> 00:28:11,803
No, Mr. Booth
recommended me your name.

560
00:28:11,883 --> 00:28:12,963
He was a nice man.

561
00:28:13,003 --> 00:28:14,723
He used to called me
Genda affectionately.

562
00:28:14,883 --> 00:28:15,983
Genda?

563
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:17,443
As in hippopotamus?

564
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:19,363
No, no, that's Gainda
Da this is Gentha-tha

565
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:22,683
This is not the same.
- Oh, Ganda, meaning dirty.

566
00:28:22,723 --> 00:28:26,258
No, it means flower...marigold.

567
00:28:26,298 --> 00:28:28,643
Marigold. A lovely name.

568
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:30,043
Shall we go inside?
- No.

569
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:31,283
We will not go inside.

570
00:28:31,323 --> 00:28:32,363
Who is the boss? I am the boss.

571
00:28:32,403 --> 00:28:33,406
Who is the boss?
- You're the boss.

572
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:35,285
Yes. So you will not go inside.

573
00:28:35,556 --> 00:28:37,283
I will ask you to come inside.

574
00:28:37,363 --> 00:28:38,523
Please come inside.

575
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:39,895
May I sir?
- Yes.

576
00:28:44,603 --> 00:28:46,163
And now we come to the 50's.

577
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:49,698
Gendamal's younger brother,
Gulabchand Hemraj.

578
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,002
Hemraj family's most useless son.

579
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,923
Alcohol, women, gambling, race.

580
00:28:54,003 --> 00:28:56,363
You can say he had every
bad habit in the world.

581
00:28:56,523 --> 00:28:57,843
Complete Casanova.

582
00:28:57,923 --> 00:28:59,843
Those days he was
madly in love with..

583
00:28:59,883 --> 00:29:02,003
..the famous singer
Manoranjana Kumari..

584
00:29:02,203 --> 00:29:05,003
..of those days, and also invested
lots of money in her films.

585
00:29:05,123 --> 00:29:06,883
Manoranjana Kumari?
- Yes.

586
00:29:07,243 --> 00:29:08,603
She always said.

587
00:29:08,923 --> 00:29:10,403
Entertainment.
Entertainment.

588
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:13,283
And only entertainment
is what makes a film successful.

589
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:18,083
Entertaining the director, producer
and actor behind the scenes.

590
00:29:18,203 --> 00:29:19,723
And she wouldn't waste a moment..

591
00:29:19,803 --> 00:29:23,963
..entertaining anyone she liked,
Manoranjana Kumari.

592
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:47,363
"I won't give it."

593
00:29:47,723 --> 00:29:51,363
"I won't give it."

594
00:29:51,803 --> 00:29:55,393
"I won't give my heart for free."

595
00:29:55,563 --> 00:29:59,363
"I won't give my heart for free."

596
00:30:16,242 --> 00:30:19,603
"Trying to cajole me."

597
00:30:20,388 --> 00:30:23,723
"But first check your pockets."

598
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:31,997
"Trying to cajole me."

599
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:36,083
"But first check your pockets."

600
00:30:36,683 --> 00:30:40,265
"Check your bank balance first."

601
00:30:40,796 --> 00:30:44,043
"And then say I love you."

602
00:30:44,202 --> 00:30:48,169
"O beloved, if you don't pay.."

603
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:52,004
"..the taxes for this service,
you won't get anything."

604
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,523
"I won't give it."

605
00:30:54,977 --> 00:30:56,603
"I won't give it."

606
00:30:56,748 --> 00:30:58,523
"I won't give it."

607
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,443
"I won't give it for free."

608
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:04,685
"I won't give it."

609
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:08,833
"I won't give my heart for free."

610
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:12,923
"I won't give it."

611
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:16,921
"I won't give it."

612
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:24,347
"I won't give my heart for free."

613
00:31:24,793 --> 00:31:27,163
"I won't give my heart for free."

614
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:29,643
I am not asking your
heart for free, Manoranjana.

615
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,563
Did I give you these earrings,
the necklace for free?

616
00:31:32,818 --> 00:31:34,385
Don't they have a value?

617
00:31:34,528 --> 00:31:36,043
Don't they have a price?

618
00:31:36,617 --> 00:31:40,563
And I've also transferred the
property papers in your name.

619
00:31:41,196 --> 00:31:43,403
I don't want your property.

620
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,603
All I want is a
pinch of vermillion..

621
00:31:45,896 --> 00:31:47,203
..to grace my forehead.

622
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:48,506
Foolish!

623
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:51,455
I am ready to squander all
my wealth at your bellow.

624
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:55,949
And all you demand is
a pinch of vermillion.

625
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:59,403
Yes. Make me your wife.

626
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,163
And give me some place
in your heart.

627
00:32:02,843 --> 00:32:06,443
Manoranjana is tired
of entertaining people.

628
00:32:06,838 --> 00:32:08,763
Take it easy my nightingale.

629
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,630
I love you.

630
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,590
And I swear I will take
the nuptial rounds with you..

631
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,870
...and marry you ASAP, darling.

632
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:21,122
Thank you.
- Mention not.

633
00:32:21,245 --> 00:32:24,190
Don't forget me, I beg of you.

634
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:26,790
Will give you, will
also give you the bag

635
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,190
Gulab didn't keep his promise.

636
00:32:29,971 --> 00:32:31,390
And Manoranjana's age..

637
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,674
..put a full stop
on her movie career.

638
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:36,710
And then one day
she found out, that..

639
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,430
..Gulab got married to a
famous industrialist's daughter.

640
00:32:41,434 --> 00:32:43,910
She couldn't endure
her shattered heart..

641
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,470
..and this terrible shock.

642
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:50,567
And she took to the
famous filmy bottle SAD 69.

643
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:54,881
And one day, after
finishing 69 bottles..

644
00:32:55,661 --> 00:32:57,870
..under the influence of alcohol..

645
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,870
..she hung herself from the fan.

646
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,590
Oh no!

647
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:07,230
Manoranjana's soul
decided to take refuge..

648
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,876
..in the same mansion, where she..

649
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:11,990
..had dreamt of entering
as the daughter-in-law.

650
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:37,270
"My breath severed
all ties with life."

651
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:45,390
"My delicate heart
shattered like glass."

652
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:53,830
"My heart slowly burns like ember."

653
00:33:56,246 --> 00:34:02,270
"My delicate heart
shattered like glass."

654
00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:10,990
"My delicate heart
shattered like glass."

655
00:34:33,652 --> 00:34:38,870
"My heart slowly burns like ember."

656
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:47,990
"A sigh comes out of my heart."

657
00:34:50,348 --> 00:34:56,182
"My heart slowly burns like ember."

658
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:04,430
"A sigh comes out of my heart."

659
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:12,590
"I've lost everything."

660
00:35:15,266 --> 00:35:20,910
"My delicate heart
shattered like glass."

661
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,270
Sir.

662
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,990
Please turn off the lights.

663
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,870
Your story is very nice.

664
00:35:45,146 --> 00:35:46,830
I mean it's superb.
- Thank you, sir.

665
00:35:47,031 --> 00:35:50,830
But...the production
designing will be really difficult.

666
00:35:52,094 --> 00:35:53,346
Different periods.

667
00:35:53,572 --> 00:35:55,810
The properties. Costumes.

668
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:56,959
Furniture.

669
00:35:57,118 --> 00:35:59,490
We'll have to do
detailed research. - No, sir.

670
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:01,990
We don't have to do so much
research in a ghost story.

671
00:36:03,897 --> 00:36:09,310
You know, I'll shoot
Ramsay's scenes in sepia mode.

672
00:36:09,629 --> 00:36:11,710
And Manoranjana Kumari's
scenes in black and white.

673
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:14,310
Back projection, direct lighting.

674
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,990
Every character will
have dual shadow..

675
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,670
..cast on a hand-drawn
background of the sky.

676
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:21,470
We can play around with the sky.

677
00:36:21,877 --> 00:36:23,510
We can play around with grey-scale.

678
00:36:28,459 --> 00:36:29,459
Thank you, sir.

679
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:33,710
You gave such a good
reaction on a struggler's story.

680
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:35,710
No one does that, sir.

681
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,510
I am touched, sir.

682
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,590
I am honored.

683
00:36:40,754 --> 00:36:42,910
Thank you, sir.
- Control yourself.

684
00:36:49,224 --> 00:36:50,510
Now we cut to the 70's.

685
00:36:51,153 --> 00:36:52,153
Bombay.

686
00:36:53,454 --> 00:36:54,510
Time of the underworld.

687
00:36:57,617 --> 00:36:59,350
After Gendamal's
death when Gulabchand..

688
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,634
..tried to take
over GH mills, then..

689
00:37:01,897 --> 00:37:03,510
..Gulabchand uncle, Heerachand..

690
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:07,830
..tipped famous gangster
Salim Fatela to kill Gulabchand.

691
00:37:08,124 --> 00:37:09,510
Coincidentally Salim Fatela..

692
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,190
..was also a big fan
of Manoranjana Kumari.

693
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,950
"I won't give it."

694
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:20,456
Gulabchand's ghost wanted to
live in Royal mansion too..

695
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:23,790
..and apologizes
to Manoranjana Kumari.

696
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:25,630
I am sorry, Manoranjana.

697
00:37:26,124 --> 00:37:27,570
I made a big mistake.

698
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:28,891
Forgive me.

699
00:37:29,034 --> 00:37:32,237
And give me what you
always did when you were alive.

700
00:37:32,394 --> 00:37:34,910
What?
- Your love, Manoranjana.

701
00:37:35,655 --> 00:37:38,200
Don't have dirty
picture in your mind.

702
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:41,019
Rascal, useless.

703
00:37:41,116 --> 00:37:42,878
You came back like a useless coin.

704
00:37:42,984 --> 00:37:45,082
Get out of here.
Manoranjana, go inside.

705
00:37:45,122 --> 00:37:46,933
Sorry, bro.
- Get out. Come on, out.

706
00:37:47,077 --> 00:37:48,855
Out!
- I am sorry. I am sorry.

707
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:51,579
Funny. Very funny. Too funny.

708
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:52,775
Right, sir.

709
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:55,415
And very exciting too.
- Right?

710
00:37:55,735 --> 00:37:59,575
I'll shoot this killing
portion with a hand-reel camera.

711
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:00,754
Like RGV.

712
00:38:00,794 --> 00:38:01,794
Sir, RGV?

713
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:04,495
Ram Gopal Verma.
- Oh yeah, of course.

714
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:05,535
Sir, I suggest that..

715
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,420
..you let him shoot
the killing scenes.

716
00:38:07,815 --> 00:38:08,981
Why not?

717
00:38:09,478 --> 00:38:10,935
Actually, he's my guru, you know.
- I see.

718
00:38:10,975 --> 00:38:11,975
Yes.

719
00:38:12,452 --> 00:38:13,455
I've assisted him.

720
00:38:13,495 --> 00:38:15,175
I've written dialogues for him.

721
00:38:15,655 --> 00:38:17,255
And I even operated
the camera in one film.

722
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,514
What are you saying?
- 5D.

723
00:38:18,975 --> 00:38:20,175
Sometimes under the table.

724
00:38:20,255 --> 00:38:21,712
Sometimes under the actor's face.

725
00:38:21,835 --> 00:38:23,367
And sometimes above
the fan's blade..

726
00:38:23,407 --> 00:38:26,175
..and many other places.

727
00:38:26,335 --> 00:38:27,653
Superb, sir.

728
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:30,375
This project is
getting very interesting.

729
00:38:30,415 --> 00:38:31,217
Thank you, sir.

730
00:38:31,257 --> 00:38:32,415
All the characters aren't just..

731
00:38:32,495 --> 00:38:34,375
..from different
socio-economic backgrounds..

732
00:38:34,455 --> 00:38:36,188
..in fact, they're from
different time-period as well.

733
00:38:36,228 --> 00:38:37,037
Thank you, sir.

734
00:38:37,077 --> 00:38:39,335
And this movie will have
an amazing ensemble cast.

735
00:38:39,415 --> 00:38:39,907
Thank you, sir.

736
00:38:39,947 --> 00:38:41,257
And these days there's
an award for this as well.

737
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,330
Yes, sir.

738
00:38:42,615 --> 00:38:43,815
Bro, continue.

739
00:38:44,335 --> 00:38:46,655
Many of the old
haunted houses in Mumbai..

740
00:38:46,695 --> 00:38:49,015
..were being razed down in
the name of development.

741
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:50,775
And the ghosts living in them..

742
00:38:50,815 --> 00:38:52,502
..decided to make
Gendamal's mansion..

743
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:55,135
..their permanent
address and came to them.

744
00:38:55,615 --> 00:38:58,135
But it was getting
difficult for Gendamal..

745
00:38:58,215 --> 00:39:01,055
..to adjust and
accommodate everyone.

746
00:39:01,135 --> 00:39:04,055
So how did the ghosts
accommodation problem get solved?

747
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:06,695
Sir, an interview board was formed.

748
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:10,055
This is very loud, get it repaired.

749
00:39:10,095 --> 00:39:11,935
And not just from Mumbai, but..

750
00:39:12,015 --> 00:39:14,175
..ghosts from the
different parts of the country..

751
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:16,641
..in fact, even from outside the
country came from the interview.

752
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,655
Don't bend so much.

753
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:22,095
Otherwise you'll hit your
head on the ground and break it.

754
00:39:22,175 --> 00:39:23,575
There's gas filled in your head.

755
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:26,714
Take this pill and go.

756
00:39:29,892 --> 00:39:33,812
Mister, the leaf that you chew
is called a 'Paan' (betel-leaf).

757
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:36,028
And my name's Akbar Khwaza Khan..

758
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:38,804
alias Natwar Khawaza Khan
alias Khatwar Khwaza Khan.

759
00:39:39,092 --> 00:39:41,452
That's fine, but which one's
out of these three is your name?

760
00:39:41,541 --> 00:39:43,692
Gentleman, the person's
name is Akbar Khwaza Khan.

761
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:44,852
And what's your name?

762
00:39:44,932 --> 00:39:46,452
I am Akbar Khwaza Khan.

763
00:39:46,612 --> 00:39:48,492
Then what is person's name?

764
00:39:48,612 --> 00:39:49,892
Gentleman, this is Urdu dialect.

765
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:51,932
There's just me, there's no us.

766
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:52,696
Oh you mean.

767
00:39:52,736 --> 00:39:55,132
You are my mother and you are my
father.. you are my friend too.

768
00:39:55,212 --> 00:39:56,922
It's an old Hindi film from
know you will not understand..

769
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:58,348
..but nothing to worry.
- Continue

770
00:39:58,502 --> 00:40:00,532
In Continue We're Pindari's,
mister.

771
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:02,012
Muslim-Maratha are brothers.

772
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:03,652
We fought the battle of Mahirpur.

773
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,372
Warrior.
- Warrior Akbar.

774
00:40:06,452 --> 00:40:07,852
Jodha-Akbar!

775
00:40:08,012 --> 00:40:09,972
You movie buff.

776
00:40:10,332 --> 00:40:12,172
Not Jodha-Akbar! Warrior Akbar.

777
00:40:12,252 --> 00:40:13,332
Talk with respect.

778
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:14,052
Continue.

779
00:40:14,092 --> 00:40:17,692
Well, I was king of Indore's
Malhar Holkar's special chef.

780
00:40:17,772 --> 00:40:19,372
How did you become a ghost?

781
00:40:19,532 --> 00:40:21,732
Mister,
during the war of Mahirpur..

782
00:40:21,772 --> 00:40:24,132
..I tried to make
a hole in kitchen..

783
00:40:24,212 --> 00:40:26,932
..and keep an eye on
the enemy for the king.

784
00:40:27,372 --> 00:40:29,012
But I didn't know that the enemy..

785
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:31,172
..already made a
hole in the back wall..

786
00:40:31,252 --> 00:40:33,812
..and have their guns aimed..

787
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:35,532
..at the kind's special chef.

788
00:40:35,612 --> 00:40:37,467
On the whole what happened?

789
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:41,772
On the whole the enemy
filled my whole body with holes..

790
00:40:41,892 --> 00:40:44,812
..that I didn't know
where do I breathe from..

791
00:40:44,972 --> 00:40:46,572
..and from where do I..

792
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:49,932
Mister, that's why I
hate these Britishers.

793
00:40:50,252 --> 00:40:52,052
Is he talking about me?
- Yes.

794
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:53,292
He says he likes you.

795
00:40:53,332 --> 00:40:54,332
Oh, hello.

796
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:57,692
Mister, the kitchen
where I used to live.

797
00:40:58,034 --> 00:40:59,972
Now someone's opened
a tea-stall there.

798
00:41:00,052 --> 00:41:01,532
And now I am kitchen-less.

799
00:41:03,692 --> 00:41:07,292
Let's appoint him for
making non-veg food.

800
00:41:07,452 --> 00:41:08,492
Select.

801
00:41:09,372 --> 00:41:10,012
Selected.

802
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:11,100
My name's PK.

803
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:13,020
I was a film producer in Mumbai.

804
00:41:13,412 --> 00:41:17,092
You might know that a film
producer's life...is really bad.

805
00:41:17,332 --> 00:41:19,132
First run after the
director for the script.

806
00:41:19,212 --> 00:41:20,892
Then run after the hero for dates.

807
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:23,094
Then run after the
heroine to dress her up fully.

808
00:41:23,212 --> 00:41:24,845
You get so good at running..

809
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:26,959
..that, if you make the
producer run in the Olympics..

810
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:28,332
..then he'll
definitely win a gold medal.

811
00:41:28,372 --> 00:41:30,892
Sir. Why does he use
that word when he speaks?

812
00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:32,972
Because the rascal does
not deserve to be here.

813
00:41:33,012 --> 00:41:33,932
Out!

814
00:41:33,972 --> 00:41:35,452
Reject him.
- Why, sir?

815
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:36,332
Rejected.

816
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:38,132
What did you do, rascal?
- Sorry, sir.

817
00:41:38,212 --> 00:41:39,812
Hello, sir.
I am Bhootnath Bhaduri.

818
00:41:39,892 --> 00:41:40,932
Bhoot..
- Yes.

819
00:41:41,012 --> 00:41:44,252
Before the partition I
lived in East Bengal.

820
00:41:44,372 --> 00:41:46,532
Back there I was a
compounder with the doctor.

821
00:41:46,612 --> 00:41:47,892
I used to give
medicines to the patients.

822
00:41:48,092 --> 00:41:51,012
And after the
partition I came to Bombay.

823
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:52,732
Mumbai. Mumbai.

824
00:41:52,812 --> 00:41:54,812
You're so stupid, brother.

825
00:41:54,852 --> 00:41:56,372
There was no Mumbai back then.

826
00:41:56,452 --> 00:41:58,092
It was just Bombay back then.

827
00:41:58,172 --> 00:41:59,412
So I came to Bombay..

828
00:41:59,492 --> 00:42:01,692
..and started living
close to the railway tracks.

829
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:03,052
It was nice. It was nice.

830
00:42:03,132 --> 00:42:05,612
But my life had become terrible.

831
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:07,532
Every day the train pass-by..

832
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:11,932
..making the clacking sounds.

833
00:42:12,252 --> 00:42:15,772
One day a train passed
too close to my ears.

834
00:42:15,852 --> 00:42:16,932
I didn't realize.

835
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:19,892
But then someone said
"Bengali man passed away".

836
00:42:19,972 --> 00:42:22,372
That's when I realized
that I am dead.

837
00:42:22,612 --> 00:42:24,692
So after that I
started living on a tree.

838
00:42:24,883 --> 00:42:26,723
Then one day few people
came and said..

839
00:42:26,763 --> 00:42:28,612
..we'll make a highway here,
four-lane highway.

840
00:42:28,692 --> 00:42:30,972
And they cut down the tree.
I lost my home.

841
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:34,132
After that I searched for a home..

842
00:42:34,172 --> 00:42:36,732
..but, I couldn't find a
single home in Mumbai.

843
00:42:36,812 --> 00:42:38,252
Bombay. Bombay.

844
00:42:38,692 --> 00:42:41,012
He's very stupid.

845
00:42:41,783 --> 00:42:44,743
Now it's Mumbai, there's
no more Bombay anymore.

846
00:42:46,253 --> 00:42:49,212
You see, East Bengal
became Bangladesh.

847
00:42:49,292 --> 00:42:50,692
Bombay became Mumbai.

848
00:42:50,772 --> 00:42:52,132
Humans become devil.

849
00:42:52,212 --> 00:42:54,189
But I was a refugee
even before I died..

850
00:42:54,229 --> 00:42:55,972
..and I am a refugee
even after I am dead.

851
00:42:56,052 --> 00:42:57,172
Nothing happened to me.

852
00:42:58,252 --> 00:43:00,292
Your story is very touching.

853
00:43:01,132 --> 00:43:03,692
A Compounder that's bit
like a doctor Isn't it?

854
00:43:04,023 --> 00:43:05,012
I know better.

855
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:07,892
After eating Khwaja
Khan's food we might need him.

856
00:43:08,097 --> 00:43:08,794
Okay.

857
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:09,834
Accepted.

858
00:43:10,434 --> 00:43:11,434
Accepted.

859
00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:13,572
Thank you.
Thank you, brother.

860
00:43:13,732 --> 00:43:16,492
Try this medicine.

861
00:43:16,892 --> 00:43:18,412
Take it. Take it.
Take this pill.

862
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,732
Always works, brother.

863
00:43:23,377 --> 00:43:24,612
So fast?
- Yes.

864
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:27,892
For the next
interview we'll go outdoors.

865
00:43:28,265 --> 00:43:29,211
Okay.

866
00:43:29,251 --> 00:43:30,251
Oh, God!

867
00:43:30,864 --> 00:43:33,052
It is still not working,
but this is working.

868
00:43:34,887 --> 00:43:35,887
Sir.

869
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:37,652
I am sorry. I am sorry.

870
00:43:37,938 --> 00:43:38,972
I am sorry.

871
00:43:39,396 --> 00:43:41,292
Brigadier Hoshiyar
Singh from Hoshiyarpur..

872
00:43:41,332 --> 00:43:43,007
..winner of Dharamveer Chakra, sir.

873
00:43:43,145 --> 00:43:44,145
Sir!

874
00:43:44,203 --> 00:43:47,283
Sir, shall we talk and talk
and pass some gas too? - No.

875
00:43:47,363 --> 00:43:49,003
I mean pass some time, sir.
- Yes.

876
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:50,083
Sir.
- Sir.

877
00:43:50,323 --> 00:43:53,363
In the year of 1999, the enemy..

878
00:43:53,443 --> 00:43:55,963
..was showering bullets on us.

879
00:43:56,136 --> 00:44:00,723
We had reacquired many parts
of Drass and Batalik sector.

880
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:02,883
In the happiness of the victory..

881
00:44:02,963 --> 00:44:04,403
..our convoy was moving ahead..

882
00:44:04,483 --> 00:44:07,043
..singing 'Hindustan Hamara',
when suddenly.

883
00:44:07,549 --> 00:44:08,723
we were shelled.

884
00:44:08,883 --> 00:44:10,255
We were bombarded.

885
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:13,116
Sir...sir..

886
00:44:13,354 --> 00:44:15,763
I guess the enemy ghosts are
bombarding this place as well.

887
00:44:15,843 --> 00:44:16,963
We should be careful.
- Relax.

888
00:44:17,043 --> 00:44:19,523
We should..
- Relax, there's nobody here.

889
00:44:19,603 --> 00:44:21,243
It's just a passing phase.

890
00:44:21,323 --> 00:44:22,123
Passing.

891
00:44:22,163 --> 00:44:23,363
It's passed.

892
00:44:23,603 --> 00:44:25,123
I respect your opinion, sir.

893
00:44:25,203 --> 00:44:27,603
But an army man should
always be alert, sir.

894
00:44:27,683 --> 00:44:29,803
Why?
- We attained martyrdom.

895
00:44:29,963 --> 00:44:33,188
And even after we died the
government scammed our coffins.

896
00:44:33,228 --> 00:44:35,563
Why? Because we weren't alert.

897
00:44:35,643 --> 00:44:37,843
This is the perfect man
to maintain security..

898
00:44:37,923 --> 00:44:39,283
..for our mansion.
- Okay.

899
00:44:40,187 --> 00:44:41,710
Hoshiyar Singh.
- Yes sir.

900
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:44,483
Situation and breeze, both
are quite worse. - I know, sir.

901
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:48,443
But you used your brains,
so I select you.

902
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,083
I am Aatmaram Paswan.

903
00:44:52,302 --> 00:44:53,523
No, you were.

904
00:44:54,206 --> 00:44:55,443
Better take the Ram and
Paswan out of your name.

905
00:44:55,523 --> 00:44:56,603
Now you're just Aatma (spirit).

906
00:44:56,758 --> 00:44:57,923
District was Darbhanga.

907
00:44:58,042 --> 00:44:59,203
No, it still is.

908
00:44:59,352 --> 00:45:01,083
You're dead, but
Darbhanga is still alive.

909
00:45:01,237 --> 00:45:03,392
What did you do?
- Sir, during the day..

910
00:45:03,432 --> 00:45:05,323
..I used to drive
the taxi in Mumbai.

911
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:07,003
And sleep on the footpath at night.

912
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:09,643
One night,
just before the new year..

913
00:45:09,813 --> 00:45:11,603
..I was sleeping
covered in my blanket.

914
00:45:11,863 --> 00:45:15,283
Suddenly, a rich man,
who was very drunk..

915
00:45:15,363 --> 00:45:17,683
..drove his car onto the footpath.

916
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:19,560
Exactly at the spot
where I was sleeping.

917
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,563
And right then Aatmaram's soul..

918
00:45:21,705 --> 00:45:23,911
..was liberated from
Aatmaram's body. Right?

919
00:45:24,025 --> 00:45:25,523
I don't know, sir.

920
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,963
I am a poor man.

921
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:29,203
I have an old model
car parked outside.

922
00:45:29,534 --> 00:45:31,523
Can you take me
to the beach in that?

923
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:33,102
I will take you
wherever you want, sir.

924
00:45:33,142 --> 00:45:34,763
Fine, fine. Yes, what do you say?

925
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:37,443
This driver does have some drive.
- Yes.

926
00:45:37,695 --> 00:45:38,695
Accept him.

927
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:39,883
The whiteman said something.

928
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:41,083
Selected.

929
00:45:41,263 --> 00:45:43,203
Myself Robin Hooda.

930
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,723
Robin Hood?
- Not Hood.

931
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,283
Hooda. From Rohtak, Haryana.

932
00:45:48,635 --> 00:45:49,635
Father was an engineer..

933
00:45:49,683 --> 00:45:51,203
..so, he wanted me
to be an engineer too.

934
00:45:51,412 --> 00:45:52,403
And mother was a doctor.

935
00:45:52,443 --> 00:45:54,003
She wanted to see me in
the operation theatre.

936
00:45:54,143 --> 00:45:55,963
But I was interested in
music since I was a kid.

937
00:45:56,043 --> 00:45:56,923
Rock music.

938
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,323
Dodes, Metallica.

939
00:45:58,776 --> 00:46:01,523
Anyway, I formed a band.
Also released an album.

940
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:03,203
We sold 13 CDs in the market.

941
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:04,163
That's all.

942
00:46:04,203 --> 00:46:06,283
Squandered lots of money,
also got humiliated.

943
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:07,563
And I also went into depression.

944
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,803
I couldn't write songs.
The writer in me was blocked.

945
00:46:10,044 --> 00:46:11,803
In frustration
I started taking drugs.

946
00:46:11,931 --> 00:46:15,163
Drugs you mean Aspro,
Anacin and Crocin.

947
00:46:15,386 --> 00:46:16,810
No. Marijuana, cannabis.

948
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:20,283
Earlier I took small doses.
Later I increased the dosage.

949
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,443
One day I injected excess heroine.

950
00:46:23,707 --> 00:46:25,015
When I came to my senses..

951
00:46:25,055 --> 00:46:27,483
..I realized that's Robin
Hooda lying on the ice-slab.

952
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:30,123
My nose was plugged with cotton.

953
00:46:30,379 --> 00:46:32,523
It would be nice to
have a musician. - Yes.

954
00:46:32,843 --> 00:46:33,843
I believe so.

955
00:46:34,215 --> 00:46:35,710
Here at Royal Mansion,
we would have..

956
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,563
..different kinds of
musicians visiting us.

957
00:46:37,803 --> 00:46:40,533
Really?
- Yes. They would come, perform..

958
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:43,643
..then eat, and after
they ate, I would perform.

959
00:46:43,888 --> 00:46:45,561
But whenever I
performed they would leave.

960
00:46:45,648 --> 00:46:46,723
I don't know why. Selected.

961
00:46:58,664 --> 00:46:59,664
You're the boss.

962
00:47:01,926 --> 00:47:02,926
Hi, I am Tina.

963
00:47:03,314 --> 00:47:04,314
I am.. I am..I am

964
00:47:06,122 --> 00:47:07,202
No, no, it's alright.

965
00:47:07,521 --> 00:47:08,922
I'm Gendamal Hemraj.

966
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:10,139
Please sit down.

967
00:47:10,762 --> 00:47:13,013
Daughter of famous
industrialist Pran Chopra.

968
00:47:14,104 --> 00:47:16,642
Power-plants, chemical industries,
real-estate.

969
00:47:16,842 --> 00:47:19,362
My dad used to do
every kind of business.

970
00:47:19,562 --> 00:47:22,563
You know what, I was a
really pampered kid.

971
00:47:22,962 --> 00:47:25,926
And on top of that,
I loved to party.

972
00:47:26,113 --> 00:47:28,184
Heineken was my favorite beer

973
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:30,322
One day I realized that..

974
00:47:30,402 --> 00:47:33,042
..due to partying
and drinking beer..

975
00:47:33,162 --> 00:47:35,162
..I had gained so much weight.

976
00:47:35,482 --> 00:47:37,263
Right then I joined a gym.

977
00:47:37,802 --> 00:47:40,682
And that's where I met Sam.

978
00:47:41,562 --> 00:47:42,562
Sam?

979
00:47:42,642 --> 00:47:44,722
Sam Gonzalvis,
my gym instructor.

980
00:47:44,802 --> 00:47:47,097
I was totally in love with him.

981
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:50,435
One day my mom-dad
found out everything.

982
00:47:50,842 --> 00:47:53,836
They tried to bribe
me for leaving Sam.

983
00:47:54,442 --> 00:47:55,802
But when I didn't agree..

984
00:47:55,922 --> 00:47:57,942
..they made Sam
disappear from Mumbai.

985
00:47:58,162 --> 00:47:59,626
I could never forget Sam.

986
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,202
I was in love.

987
00:48:01,642 --> 00:48:03,720
And I was completely heart-broken.

988
00:48:04,002 --> 00:48:06,057
I didn't know what to do.

989
00:48:06,442 --> 00:48:08,322
One day I climbed
up to the 10th floor..

990
00:48:08,442 --> 00:48:10,442
..and jumped down.

991
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,022
I killed myself.

992
00:48:12,402 --> 00:48:15,202
And when I died
I saw my parents crying.

993
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,373
I felt really, really sad.

994
00:48:23,162 --> 00:48:24,162
Accepted.

995
00:48:26,467 --> 00:48:27,242
Thanks.

996
00:48:27,282 --> 00:48:29,202
After the interview was over..

997
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:31,599
..Royal Mansion put up
a houseful board.

998
00:48:31,922 --> 00:48:33,322
And that night Gendamal..

999
00:48:33,402 --> 00:48:36,882
..called the selected ghosts
in the hall for a welcome drink.

1000
00:48:40,802 --> 00:48:43,282
My dear late Ladies and Gentlemen.

1001
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:47,727
A ghostly welcome to Royal Mansion.

1002
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,432
Today is a unique day for us.

1003
00:48:52,002 --> 00:48:53,362
It's unimaginable.

1004
00:48:53,442 --> 00:48:55,362
Because after today,
all of us..

1005
00:48:55,442 --> 00:48:56,915
..will be living
under the same roof..

1006
00:48:57,242 --> 00:48:59,366
..which might not have
been possible if we were humans.

1007
00:49:01,722 --> 00:49:02,722
Friends.

1008
00:49:02,962 --> 00:49:05,082
When we were alive,
the fear of death..

1009
00:49:05,162 --> 00:49:06,882
..wouldn't let us live peacefully.

1010
00:49:07,766 --> 00:49:09,122
But now we're dead.

1011
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:11,042
Now we're not scared of death.

1012
00:49:13,322 --> 00:49:16,402
So come...from today
we enjoy our life..

1013
00:49:16,442 --> 00:49:19,082
I mean our afterlife.

1014
00:49:19,759 --> 00:49:24,322
And swear that we
couldn't be a good human being.

1015
00:49:24,535 --> 00:49:26,431
But we will definitely
be a good ghost.

1016
00:49:26,842 --> 00:49:28,762
And we'll make the
ghosts of Royal mansion..

1017
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:31,322
..proud amongst the
ghosts in the world.

1018
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:32,802
Yes!
- Cheers.

1019
00:49:32,882 --> 00:49:34,042
Tell me one thing.

1020
00:49:34,122 --> 00:49:37,362
Did all the ghosts settle in
Royal Mansion? - Yes, sir.

1021
00:49:37,753 --> 00:49:40,762
All the ghosts lived
here comfortably.

1022
00:49:40,921 --> 00:49:42,402
Aatmaram.

1023
00:49:42,758 --> 00:49:44,322
You dead-man.

1024
00:49:44,602 --> 00:49:46,322
Where are you dying?

1025
00:49:46,402 --> 00:49:48,162
Hurry up.

1026
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:49,242
Start the car.

1027
00:49:49,322 --> 00:49:50,882
I've to go to Dadar TT.

1028
00:49:51,002 --> 00:49:55,362
And I've to buy sweets
from Damodar's shop.

1029
00:49:56,802 --> 00:49:58,082
Aatmaram.

1030
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,322
You're a insult
to the ghost society.

1031
00:50:00,402 --> 00:50:03,002
It's morning
and you're still sleeping.

1032
00:50:03,082 --> 00:50:06,299
I am not sleeping, just
straightening my back.

1033
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:09,562
Rascal, you're a crooked man
that's why you've a crooked back.

1034
00:50:09,642 --> 00:50:11,882
I don't know. I am a poor man.

1035
00:50:12,002 --> 00:50:13,322
Rascal.

1036
00:50:13,402 --> 00:50:15,082
If you're a poor man then
sit in the driver's seat.

1037
00:50:15,162 --> 00:50:16,242
What are you doing at the back?

1038
00:50:16,322 --> 00:50:17,402
Yes.
- And hurry up.

1039
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:19,762
Hurry up,
I've to get to market soon.

1040
00:50:19,802 --> 00:50:21,642
Why the market so soon?

1041
00:50:21,682 --> 00:50:25,202
You fool, look there.

1042
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,922
In the sky.

1043
00:50:27,042 --> 00:50:28,522
The sky is this way.

1044
00:50:28,663 --> 00:50:30,722
Here too.
- You're a poor man.

1045
00:50:30,802 --> 00:50:31,922
So look here.
- I see.

1046
00:50:32,002 --> 00:50:36,682
See, the stars have set
and the sun is shining.

1047
00:50:37,082 --> 00:50:39,122
Now let's go, start the car.

1048
00:50:39,762 --> 00:50:42,722
The great Indian poor man.

1049
00:50:43,522 --> 00:50:45,162
But why does he have to buy?

1050
00:50:45,322 --> 00:50:47,442
He can just extend
his hand and steal it.

1051
00:50:47,522 --> 00:50:49,082
Sir, he's a Bengali
ghost after all.

1052
00:50:49,162 --> 00:50:50,722
Until he doesn't argue and haggle..

1053
00:50:50,802 --> 00:50:53,675
..with the shopkeeper,
who will call him...

1054
00:50:54,922 --> 00:50:57,802
You've done a good study
of the Bengali's character traits.

1055
00:50:57,882 --> 00:50:59,682
Thank you, sir. And
thank for this also, sir.

1056
00:50:59,762 --> 00:51:01,162
Sir, do you like the story?

1057
00:51:01,322 --> 00:51:03,802
That's why I am also giving
you your first installment.

1058
00:51:03,962 --> 00:51:04,802
Right, sir.

1059
00:51:04,842 --> 00:51:06,602
So all the shopping was done.

1060
00:51:06,913 --> 00:51:10,042
Bhootnath returned with
fresh sweets and snacks..

1061
00:51:10,242 --> 00:51:15,469
..to express his
eternal love to Manoranjana.

1062
00:51:16,563 --> 00:51:18,002
Stop. Stop.

1063
00:51:18,202 --> 00:51:19,962
I am stopping.

1064
00:51:20,134 --> 00:51:21,962
Why are you heading
out of the gate again?

1065
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:23,442
Now do one thing.

1066
00:51:23,562 --> 00:51:25,076
Get what's down there.

1067
00:51:25,657 --> 00:51:26,275
What?

1068
00:51:26,315 --> 00:51:29,042
Get what's down there.

1069
00:51:29,202 --> 00:51:30,122
Oh no.

1070
00:51:30,162 --> 00:51:31,202
No.

1071
00:51:31,282 --> 00:51:33,362
Get what's down there?
- How?

1072
00:51:33,562 --> 00:51:38,442
Not yours, what's down mine.
- What?

1073
00:51:38,482 --> 00:51:39,762
The bag.

1074
00:51:39,842 --> 00:51:41,442
Get the shopping bag.

1075
00:51:41,522 --> 00:51:43,007
It's between my legs.

1076
00:51:44,202 --> 00:51:46,202
Get it out.
- Yes, sir.

1077
00:51:47,006 --> 00:51:49,482
You might be a poor man,
but take bigger steps.

1078
00:51:49,717 --> 00:51:51,082
Hurry up!
Hurry up!

1079
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:56,042
How dare you come to the
1st floor in this uniform?

1080
00:51:56,271 --> 00:51:58,962
I don't know, sir.
I am a poor man.

1081
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:01,602
I wonder where I get
it from. I mean courage.

1082
00:52:01,682 --> 00:52:03,402
Keep the bags in the
kitchen and go down.

1083
00:52:03,482 --> 00:52:04,682
That's a good idea.

1084
00:52:04,802 --> 00:52:06,482
Keep it.

1085
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:11,654
Bhootnath,
you're a high-class Bengali.

1086
00:52:12,432 --> 00:52:14,362
Why do you entertain
such lowly people?

1087
00:52:14,482 --> 00:52:17,682
You won't tell me who I'll
entertain and who I will not.

1088
00:52:17,846 --> 00:52:19,419
Because you're a
double-standard man.

1089
00:52:19,459 --> 00:52:20,745
You brought that home..

1090
00:52:20,785 --> 00:52:22,802
..for the sake of your
Biryanis and Kebabs.

1091
00:52:22,842 --> 00:52:24,682
Did I say something?
- Don't say that.

1092
00:52:24,803 --> 00:52:26,162
I am telling you..

1093
00:52:26,242 --> 00:52:27,722
You fools.

1094
00:52:27,947 --> 00:52:30,468
You're 21st century ghosts
and still talk about classes.

1095
00:52:30,763 --> 00:52:31,763
Now hear a song.

1096
00:52:31,842 --> 00:52:32,802
No, no.

1097
00:52:32,842 --> 00:52:34,983
Stop singing. Stop.

1098
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:38,624
I already died once. I don't want
to die again hearing your song.

1099
00:52:38,899 --> 00:52:41,922
I guess he lost his
musical sense when he died. - No.

1100
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:44,402
My musical sense is intact.

1101
00:52:44,793 --> 00:52:47,177
But the way you sing,
it's not called music.

1102
00:52:47,393 --> 00:52:49,713
We selected him for this mansion..

1103
00:52:49,873 --> 00:52:53,860
..so that I will get to
hear classical music again.

1104
00:52:54,033 --> 00:52:56,593
But he turned
everything un-classical.

1105
00:52:56,713 --> 00:52:59,033
True. True.

1106
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:04,153
Bhootnath.

1107
00:53:04,873 --> 00:53:06,633
When I was alive,
I had a similar..

1108
00:53:06,713 --> 00:53:08,673
..old and grumpy man
in my neighborhood.

1109
00:53:09,033 --> 00:53:11,553
He used to speak
nonsense about my music.

1110
00:53:12,033 --> 00:53:13,833
Once that old man lodged a
complaint with the police..

1111
00:53:13,913 --> 00:53:15,233
..to stop my jam session.

1112
00:53:16,513 --> 00:53:18,073
It's the same situation
all over again..

1113
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,153
..even after I am dead.

1114
00:53:19,193 --> 00:53:21,433
Son, don't sulk.

1115
00:53:21,593 --> 00:53:23,153
Don't be sad.

1116
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,673
Do one thing.

1117
00:53:24,753 --> 00:53:26,993
Start singing folk songs.

1118
00:53:27,153 --> 00:53:29,113
If you don't know folk,
then sing patriotic songs.

1119
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:30,873
Like 'Vande Mataram'..

1120
00:53:31,033 --> 00:53:32,473
Bhootnath. Bhootnath.

1121
00:53:32,673 --> 00:53:34,793
I've already prepared a
remix version of this song.

1122
00:53:34,873 --> 00:53:36,633
But I don't want my songs..

1123
00:53:36,673 --> 00:53:38,313
..to be bounded by country borders.

1124
00:53:38,393 --> 00:53:39,433
Great.

1125
00:53:39,513 --> 00:53:42,913
Wonderful, Robin. Wonderful.

1126
00:53:42,993 --> 00:53:46,833
What a dialogue...about music.

1127
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:55,713
But...according to me, sing
a song for broken heart..

1128
00:53:56,113 --> 00:53:58,793
..which compels me to drink.

1129
00:53:58,873 --> 00:54:00,553
One can sing about heartbreaks..

1130
00:54:00,593 --> 00:54:01,873
..only after a few pegs.

1131
00:54:01,953 --> 00:54:05,089
You mean first we down a few
pegs and then sing a song. - Right.

1132
00:54:05,188 --> 00:54:07,753
Then I'll take you
to Bhoot Bar today.

1133
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:08,833
Bhoot Bar.

1134
00:54:08,993 --> 00:54:10,833
Tonight's Friday night.

1135
00:54:11,044 --> 00:54:14,193
There must be gorgeous
ghosts visiting today.

1136
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,753
This is Bhoot Bar.

1137
00:54:19,793 --> 00:54:21,233
Amazing.

1138
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,233
It's so nice.

1139
00:54:23,433 --> 00:54:25,593
I thought she hasn't arrived yet.

1140
00:54:26,353 --> 00:54:27,793
Go get it.

1141
00:54:28,513 --> 00:54:29,873
Come on.

1142
00:54:31,689 --> 00:54:34,673
"..will you drink me?

1143
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:42,473
"Intoxication is
something you can't let go."

1144
00:54:43,183 --> 00:54:49,633
"It's like my beloved,
you just can't let go."

1145
00:54:54,076 --> 00:54:57,473
"The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal."

1146
00:54:57,732 --> 00:55:00,873
"Will I drink you,
or will you drink me?"

1147
00:55:01,033 --> 00:55:04,513
"The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal."

1148
00:55:04,713 --> 00:55:07,713
"Will I drink you,
or will you drink me?"

1149
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:30,273
"The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal."

1150
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:33,993
"The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal."

1151
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:40,753
"The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal."

1152
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:48,153
"Will I drink you,
or will you drink me?"

1153
00:55:48,758 --> 00:55:54,915
"The bottle...
of alcohol's such a rascal."

1154
00:55:55,105 --> 00:55:58,353
"The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal."

1155
00:55:58,593 --> 00:56:01,873
"Will I drink you,
or will you drink me?"

1156
00:56:02,033 --> 00:56:05,433
"The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal."

1157
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,873
"Will I drink you,
or will you drink me?"

1158
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:12,393
"Take a sip or gulp
down the entire bottle."

1159
00:56:12,627 --> 00:56:15,633
"Forget the world,
let's shake the world."

1160
00:56:15,852 --> 00:56:19,353
"Life's short,
let me drink half of it."

1161
00:56:19,588 --> 00:56:21,513
"Forget all your sorrows,
take a peg."

1162
00:56:21,593 --> 00:56:22,833
"Baby don't cry."

1163
00:56:23,124 --> 00:56:26,313
"I couldn't find any love,
so I picked you."

1164
00:56:26,792 --> 00:56:29,793
"I hadn't gotten over my first sorrow."
"And now I invited another."

1165
00:56:30,134 --> 00:56:33,353
"I couldn't find any love,
so I picked you."

1166
00:56:33,784 --> 00:56:36,910
"I hadn't gotten over my first sorrow."
"And now I invited another."

1167
00:56:37,641 --> 00:56:44,153
"I couldn't find any love,
so I picked you."

1168
00:56:44,721 --> 00:56:51,161
"I couldn't find any love,
so I picked you."

1169
00:56:51,601 --> 00:56:55,001
"I hadn't gotten
over my first sorrow."

1170
00:56:55,201 --> 00:56:58,401
"And now I invited another."

1171
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:05,561
"You're bound to
drown in this sorrow."

1172
00:57:05,685 --> 00:57:11,721
"The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal."

1173
00:57:15,481 --> 00:57:16,481
"Bottle."

1174
00:58:08,544 --> 00:58:14,841
"The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal."

1175
00:58:21,721 --> 00:58:23,641
"The bottle of alcohol's.."

1176
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:30,241
"Will I drink you,
or will you drink me?"

1177
00:58:41,121 --> 00:58:41,841
See, sir.

1178
00:58:41,881 --> 00:58:44,321
It matches to your vision.

1179
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:45,321
Matching.

1180
00:58:45,361 --> 00:58:48,361
Biggest commercial
complex in the country, sir.

1181
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:51,161
Superb. Find the owner.

1182
00:58:51,511 --> 00:58:52,761
Guliyani, sir.

1183
00:58:52,841 --> 00:58:54,961
Yes, Guliyani. Find the owner.

1184
00:58:55,121 --> 00:58:58,041
But, sir, there's a problem.

1185
00:59:00,281 --> 00:59:04,041
We builders setup our shop
where there's a problem.

1186
00:59:04,401 --> 00:59:08,081
So Gu, I want this Royal Mansion.

1187
00:59:08,576 --> 00:59:10,401
At any cost.

1188
00:59:10,649 --> 00:59:12,001
Get that?
- Yes, sir.

1189
00:59:12,161 --> 00:59:15,801
"Where do we go?"

1190
00:59:20,478 --> 00:59:21,718
Silence.
- Start sound.

1191
00:59:21,798 --> 00:59:22,998
Rolling.
- Camera.

1192
00:59:23,078 --> 00:59:24,118
Rolling. Clap.

1193
00:59:24,198 --> 00:59:25,958
Take 7.
- Action.

1194
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:28,798
Cut. Cut. Cut.

1195
00:59:32,437 --> 00:59:36,158
Manoranjana.
Who are you cutting?

1196
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:38,717
I was dreaming.

1197
00:59:38,757 --> 00:59:41,718
Dreaming? - I am
shooting for a film and..

1198
00:59:41,918 --> 00:59:45,878
You've crossed
the LOC of your life.

1199
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,958
So I suggest that you..

1200
00:59:48,078 --> 00:59:50,478
..stop dreaming about
shootings and films.

1201
00:59:50,786 --> 00:59:53,478
Whether a film actor
leaves her work or the world..

1202
00:59:53,872 --> 00:59:57,678
..but she can never forget
those gleaming arc lights.

1203
00:59:57,821 --> 00:59:58,821
Wow.

1204
00:59:59,514 --> 01:00:00,598
The camera.

1205
01:00:01,299 --> 01:00:02,299
The Nagra.

1206
01:00:02,817 --> 01:00:03,878
The green room.

1207
01:00:04,349 --> 01:00:05,998
Ice box, spot boy.

1208
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,278
Food from hero's home.
- Wow.

1209
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:14,853
Watching your passion
for your work..

1210
01:00:15,013 --> 01:00:17,681
..even after you're dead
has made me your...deadly fan.

1211
01:00:19,689 --> 01:00:21,398
Autograph please.

1212
01:00:21,588 --> 01:00:24,838
I don't sign on currency notes.
- Why?

1213
01:00:25,438 --> 01:00:29,186
When the chairman
of the Reserve Bank..

1214
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:32,598
..has already signed on it,
then how can I sign it?

1215
01:00:35,106 --> 01:00:36,398
Sigh my palm.

1216
01:00:37,827 --> 01:00:38,877
Pen please.

1217
01:00:40,634 --> 01:00:41,615
Name please.

1218
01:00:41,655 --> 01:00:43,038
Hoshiyar Singh.

1219
01:00:44,618 --> 01:00:49,738
Love to Hoshiyar Singh,
Manoranjana Kumari.

1220
01:00:51,658 --> 01:00:55,298
I will never wash this hand again,
even if I've to cut it.

1221
01:00:56,433 --> 01:01:00,338
You know, in 1965 when
I was in Khardunla..

1222
01:01:00,818 --> 01:01:03,538
You must be in an epic
battle with the enemy.

1223
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:04,578
No.

1224
01:01:04,618 --> 01:01:06,218
I was watching your film.

1225
01:01:06,298 --> 01:01:07,938
Love can happen anytime.

1226
01:01:08,378 --> 01:01:09,658
Such a nice title.

1227
01:01:09,738 --> 01:01:11,184
Love can happen anytime.

1228
01:01:11,536 --> 01:01:12,536
It can happen now too.

1229
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:16,338
"I am such a crazy Jatt."

1230
01:01:18,075 --> 01:01:21,018
"I am such a crazy Jatt."

1231
01:01:21,134 --> 01:01:24,338
"Couldn't understand
such a simple thing."

1232
01:01:24,418 --> 01:01:25,138
"That.."

1233
01:01:25,178 --> 01:01:26,258
Hoshiyar Singh.

1234
01:01:26,338 --> 01:01:27,898
You're showing your smartness here.

1235
01:01:27,978 --> 01:01:29,538
And Gaindamal's looking for you.

1236
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:31,898
Let's go.
- Okay.

1237
01:01:32,298 --> 01:01:33,578
Okay.

1238
01:01:34,032 --> 01:01:36,818
Thank you for your autograph.

1239
01:01:39,715 --> 01:01:43,011
We got introduced.
- Hurry up.

1240
01:01:43,218 --> 01:01:44,178
Come on.

1241
01:01:44,218 --> 01:01:47,538
"She loves."

1242
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:50,578
"She's crazy about me."

1243
01:01:50,778 --> 01:01:51,778
Sir.

1244
01:01:53,171 --> 01:01:54,658
You called, sir.

1245
01:01:55,098 --> 01:01:55,858
Who's the boss?

1246
01:01:55,898 --> 01:01:56,978
I am the boss.
Who's the boss?

1247
01:01:57,058 --> 01:01:58,738
You're the boss.
- The boss didn't call you.

1248
01:01:58,818 --> 01:01:59,578
Rotate this.

1249
01:01:59,618 --> 01:02:02,898
Manoranjana, I've seen
all your plays. - Plays?

1250
01:02:03,018 --> 01:02:07,058
No, no, I mean cinema.

1251
01:02:07,538 --> 01:02:13,138
After watching your first
film I fell in love with you.

1252
01:02:13,218 --> 01:02:15,778
Like they say,
love at first night.

1253
01:02:16,893 --> 01:02:18,138
Love at first sight.

1254
01:02:18,296 --> 01:02:20,858
I know it's love at first sight.

1255
01:02:20,999 --> 01:02:22,618
But I saw the night show.

1256
01:02:22,783 --> 01:02:25,298
So I said love at first night.

1257
01:02:25,691 --> 01:02:28,138
Oh, God! I guess the
old man's lost his mind.

1258
01:02:28,218 --> 01:02:29,898
I didn't hear anything.

1259
01:02:30,256 --> 01:02:33,498
I was a big fan of your
since I was just a kid.

1260
01:02:33,578 --> 01:02:36,058
You know, I also
made a fan club for you.

1261
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:39,378
And in that club we
all addressed you as Ma.

1262
01:02:41,086 --> 01:02:42,858
Not as in mother.

1263
01:02:42,978 --> 01:02:44,738
By Ma we meant Goddess.

1264
01:02:44,858 --> 01:02:48,898
Bhootnath, the movie
world is a bad place.

1265
01:02:49,451 --> 01:02:51,098
My Guru used to say..

1266
01:02:51,428 --> 01:02:53,298
..that you can stay in
this glittering world..

1267
01:02:53,378 --> 01:02:56,258
..only as long as
you stay beautiful.

1268
01:02:56,362 --> 01:02:57,538
Once your beauty disappears..

1269
01:02:57,618 --> 01:02:58,872
..you will disappear.

1270
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,818
How could your Guru say that?

1271
01:03:03,107 --> 01:03:06,138
Beauty is not a pot of tea..

1272
01:03:06,218 --> 01:03:08,658
..that when the tea's over,
the pot's broken.

1273
01:03:09,011 --> 01:03:12,218
Manoranjana,
your time will never be up.

1274
01:03:12,557 --> 01:03:15,218
Because you were beautiful,
you still are..

1275
01:03:15,298 --> 01:03:16,860
..and forever will be.

1276
01:03:16,953 --> 01:03:20,138
There's no point in
praising me now, Bhootnath.

1277
01:03:20,378 --> 01:03:23,406
It's very late now.
- I understand.

1278
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,738
But Manoranjana,
everyone's late here.

1279
01:03:27,022 --> 01:03:29,258
I am late Bhootnath Bhaduri.

1280
01:03:29,527 --> 01:03:32,058
You're late Manoranjana Kumari.

1281
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,178
But before it's too late.

1282
01:03:34,948 --> 01:03:37,858
Sweets and snacks for you.

1283
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:40,942
Bhootnath,
this isn't time for sweets.

1284
01:03:41,072 --> 01:03:43,178
Yes, I understand. I understand.

1285
01:03:43,518 --> 01:03:46,298
I get it. This is
time for something else.

1286
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,138
But Manoranjana, I
want to say something.

1287
01:03:50,942 --> 01:03:53,762
Like all men, you'll say..

1288
01:03:53,981 --> 01:03:56,985
..Manoranjana, I love you a lot.

1289
01:03:57,508 --> 01:04:00,378
I am fed up of
hearing this dialogue.

1290
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,938
Why will I say that?

1291
01:04:03,814 --> 01:04:06,605
I will say what I want.

1292
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:09,500
And I want to hear you sing.

1293
01:04:10,506 --> 01:04:11,506
What?

1294
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:13,538
Shameless.
Aren't you ashamed?

1295
01:04:13,661 --> 01:04:14,661
I'll show you.

1296
01:04:14,858 --> 01:04:15,858
Anybody there.

1297
01:04:16,212 --> 01:04:17,090
Anybody there.

1298
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:18,578
Manoranjana.

1299
01:04:18,887 --> 01:04:20,658
I meant song.

1300
01:04:20,698 --> 01:04:22,477
Singing.

1301
01:04:22,683 --> 01:04:24,818
"Open your door."

1302
01:04:25,012 --> 01:04:26,765
"I am standing at your threshold."

1303
01:04:26,859 --> 01:04:30,401
"Don't let me standout anymore."

1304
01:04:30,627 --> 01:04:32,818
Who's there? Who's bothering you?

1305
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,168
Manoranjana, my love..

1306
01:04:35,323 --> 01:04:38,018
..this Bhootnath's after you again.

1307
01:04:38,299 --> 01:04:39,538
But don't be scared.

1308
01:04:39,915 --> 01:04:42,245
This is Muslim-Maratha,
Khwaja Akbar Khan..

1309
01:04:42,327 --> 01:04:44,304
..chef of king Malhar
Holkar speaking.

1310
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:47,326
I will teach him a lesson.

1311
01:04:47,396 --> 01:04:51,154
You rascal,
you will teach me a lesson.

1312
01:04:51,286 --> 01:04:54,818
A soldier without a shield and
sword and come here holding a rose.

1313
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:58,178
Mind your tongue, Bhootnath.

1314
01:04:58,423 --> 01:05:00,873
Oh, God! What's going on?

1315
01:05:01,038 --> 01:05:04,718
Accept this lover's true
love and take this rose..

1316
01:05:04,878 --> 01:05:09,198
..and I'll personally
cook for you Kebabs.

1317
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:12,198
And then you'll
suffer from loose motions.

1318
01:05:12,278 --> 01:05:14,318
Enemy of my love, be alert.

1319
01:05:14,438 --> 01:05:18,598
If you have Urdu poems
then I've Bengal Tigers.

1320
01:05:18,678 --> 01:05:19,638
I won't be scared.

1321
01:05:19,678 --> 01:05:20,758
You won't be scared?
- No.

1322
01:05:20,838 --> 01:05:22,478
Then you will be killed by me.

1323
01:05:22,558 --> 01:05:24,040
Come on.
- I see.

1324
01:05:24,131 --> 01:05:25,518
I will die. You will kill me?

1325
01:05:25,558 --> 01:05:27,838
Rascal, how will you kill me?

1326
01:05:27,918 --> 01:05:30,146
How will you kill me?
- Don't provoke me.

1327
01:05:30,186 --> 01:05:31,998
Will you kill me with
the plastic rose?

1328
01:05:32,078 --> 01:05:33,798
There goes your plastic rose.

1329
01:05:33,878 --> 01:05:35,318
What the..

1330
01:05:38,598 --> 01:05:39,718
What's up, sister?

1331
01:05:39,758 --> 01:05:41,341
You've hit the jackpot.

1332
01:05:41,518 --> 01:05:42,918
One rose and three admirers.

1333
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:45,758
Oh my, God! How will I
handle three lovers?

1334
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:46,838
Three.

1335
01:05:47,237 --> 01:05:50,558
I'm experienced
at handling 30, Tina.

1336
01:05:50,858 --> 01:05:54,198
But these are old men,
and they're all dead.

1337
01:05:55,108 --> 01:05:57,438
But there's a nice
boy for you here.

1338
01:05:57,584 --> 01:05:59,918
He's single, and also ready to
mingle. If I would be at your place

1339
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:02,798
I would've taken
him on a long-drive..

1340
01:06:02,878 --> 01:06:04,198
..and eaten dinner with him.

1341
01:06:06,278 --> 01:06:07,745
You smoke so much?

1342
01:06:08,038 --> 01:06:10,198
Haven't you heard?
Smoking is injurious to health.

1343
01:06:10,278 --> 01:06:12,318
Sweetheart, when there's no
health then what's it injurious to?

1344
01:06:12,438 --> 01:06:14,478
Whatever it is, it's really bad.

1345
01:06:14,598 --> 01:06:15,878
It's stinking man.

1346
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:19,383
Tell me,
when did you start singing?

1347
01:06:19,998 --> 01:06:21,118
When I was born.

1348
01:06:21,438 --> 01:06:23,078
But when a child is born he cries.

1349
01:06:23,158 --> 01:06:24,078
I was singing.

1350
01:06:24,118 --> 01:06:27,238
But you know, people
like love, romantic music..

1351
01:06:27,318 --> 01:06:29,678
..more than what you sing.

1352
01:06:29,758 --> 01:06:31,238
To hell with it.

1353
01:06:31,438 --> 01:06:35,318
I've forsaken romance and
romantic music from my system.

1354
01:06:35,931 --> 01:06:38,678
I don't let flowers, mountains,
river, waterfalls, love..

1355
01:06:38,758 --> 01:06:40,198
..anywhere close to my music.

1356
01:06:40,278 --> 01:06:43,078
I don't sing from the mouth
I sing from my entire body.

1357
01:06:43,318 --> 01:06:47,396
A song that has passion,
openness, liberty.

1358
01:06:48,198 --> 01:06:51,358
That means you will
never sing romantic songs?

1359
01:06:51,859 --> 01:06:53,838
Never.
- But why?

1360
01:06:54,082 --> 01:06:55,438
Do you want to know the answer?

1361
01:07:04,785 --> 01:07:06,782
"I am scared of being betrayed."

1362
01:07:06,929 --> 01:07:09,238
"My heart be filled with pain."

1363
01:07:13,126 --> 01:07:15,598
"I am scared of being betrayed."

1364
01:07:15,722 --> 01:07:17,676
"My heart be filled with pain."

1365
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,946
"The thought of it makes me sweat."

1366
01:07:20,075 --> 01:07:22,118
"The thought of it makes me sweat."

1367
01:07:23,238 --> 01:07:25,358
"Love's such a rascal."

1368
01:07:25,398 --> 01:07:27,598
"Love's such a rascal."

1369
01:07:27,758 --> 01:07:29,696
"Love's such a rascal."

1370
01:07:29,736 --> 01:07:31,958
"Love's such a rascal."

1371
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:45,238
"Any boy who falls in
love with his neighbor."

1372
01:07:47,539 --> 01:07:51,638
"Any boy who falls in
love with his neighbor."

1373
01:07:51,855 --> 01:07:53,347
"You can bet that.."

1374
01:07:53,395 --> 01:07:55,958
"..he'll be fixing
tents in her marriage."

1375
01:07:56,118 --> 01:07:57,958
"It's a constant threat to life."

1376
01:07:58,038 --> 01:08:00,318
"It's a constant threat to life."

1377
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:02,472
"It's a constant threat to life."

1378
01:08:02,512 --> 01:08:04,696
"It's a constant threat to life."

1379
01:08:04,867 --> 01:08:07,001
"Love's such a rascal."

1380
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,038
"Love's such a rascal."

1381
01:08:09,238 --> 01:08:11,153
"Love's such a rascal."

1382
01:08:11,243 --> 01:08:13,478
"Love's such a rascal."

1383
01:08:13,638 --> 01:08:15,918
"Love's such a rascal."

1384
01:08:15,998 --> 01:08:17,838
"Love's such a rascal."

1385
01:08:18,038 --> 01:08:20,166
"Love's such a rascal."

1386
01:08:20,206 --> 01:08:22,438
"Love's such a rascal."

1387
01:08:39,998 --> 01:08:44,598
"Love's a butcher, it ruins a man."

1388
01:08:46,678 --> 01:08:50,718
"Love's a butcher, it ruins a man."

1389
01:08:51,195 --> 01:08:55,278
"It makes your market
value zero in a minute."

1390
01:08:55,318 --> 01:08:59,478
"Life will be worse than death."

1391
01:08:59,638 --> 01:09:03,678
"Life will be worse than death."

1392
01:09:04,118 --> 01:09:05,903
"Love's such a rascal."

1393
01:09:05,943 --> 01:09:08,318
"Love's such a rascal."

1394
01:09:08,704 --> 01:09:10,398
"Love's such a rascal."

1395
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:12,838
"Love's such a rascal."

1396
01:09:28,254 --> 01:09:30,478
"Love's such a rascal."

1397
01:09:30,942 --> 01:09:32,878
This is Haryanvi rock.

1398
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:37,517
Wow. Simply superb.

1399
01:09:37,557 --> 01:09:38,878
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

1400
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:41,358
This is a complete
insanity ambiance.

1401
01:09:41,398 --> 01:09:43,738
No, sir, hauntedness.
- What?

1402
01:09:43,968 --> 01:09:44,968
Hauntedness?

1403
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,014
Nice one.

1404
01:09:46,169 --> 01:09:49,478
So all the ghosts were
spending their days..

1405
01:09:49,598 --> 01:09:51,638
..with love and affection.

1406
01:09:52,075 --> 01:09:54,558
But one day suddenly
a problem came up.

1407
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:57,078
Problem? For the ghosts?

1408
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:01,056
I had heard that
ghosts trouble people.

1409
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:03,358
Yes, sir. But the situation
was different here.

1410
01:10:03,922 --> 01:10:05,878
The people were
troubling the ghosts.

1411
01:10:16,424 --> 01:10:19,778
They've turned Royal
Mansion into a vegetable market.

1412
01:10:20,063 --> 01:10:21,478
They're hammering
a nail on every wall.

1413
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:22,875
Someone's taking a nap.

1414
01:10:22,936 --> 01:10:24,798
Someone throwing used plates.
And someone's spitting.

1415
01:10:25,097 --> 01:10:26,638
And they've setup a
rail-track on the floor..

1416
01:10:26,718 --> 01:10:28,598
..and people are getting
on and off that thing.

1417
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:31,447
That means they
have no civic sense.

1418
01:10:31,487 --> 01:10:34,558
And the heroine has filled my room
with smoke from her cigarette.

1419
01:10:35,012 --> 01:10:36,095
I was a film actress too.

1420
01:10:36,305 --> 01:10:38,198
But even I never
smoked so many cigarettes.

1421
01:10:38,578 --> 01:10:39,878
And she's showing such attitude.

1422
01:10:40,137 --> 01:10:41,215
Let's lodge a report
at the police station.

1423
01:10:41,257 --> 01:10:43,104
Who will lodge a ghost's report?

1424
01:10:43,223 --> 01:10:45,650
And anyway, they already
bribe the police at first.

1425
01:10:45,829 --> 01:10:47,743
Then we'll have to
use our special power.

1426
01:10:47,886 --> 01:10:48,592
What's that?

1427
01:10:48,632 --> 01:10:49,678
Let's scare them away.

1428
01:10:50,146 --> 01:10:53,955
Sister, I feel you should
teach that heroine a lesson first.

1429
01:10:54,313 --> 01:10:55,218
Fine.

1430
01:10:55,258 --> 01:10:57,978
All the film actresses are
nervous before the shot.

1431
01:10:58,218 --> 01:10:59,698
I'll scare her so badly..

1432
01:10:59,778 --> 01:11:01,618
..that she'll never
act again in her life.

1433
01:11:01,789 --> 01:11:03,298
Scene 1, take 1.

1434
01:11:04,035 --> 01:11:05,298
And action.

1435
01:11:26,978 --> 01:11:30,018
She fell down,
the shooting was cancelled.

1436
01:11:30,178 --> 01:11:33,298
Mid Day and Mirror covered
the story on their front page.

1437
01:11:33,378 --> 01:11:36,338
And slowly the news, that
GH Mills and Royal Mansion..

1438
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:38,898
..are haunted, spread in
the entire film industry.

1439
01:11:39,178 --> 01:11:42,618
Producers and
directors stopped filming here.

1440
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:45,218
The ghosts of Royal Mansion won..

1441
01:11:45,298 --> 01:11:47,218
..and it was celebration time.

1442
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:48,938
And on this joyous occasion..

1443
01:11:49,018 --> 01:11:51,904
..Gaindamal decided to take
all the ghosts out for a picnic.

1444
01:11:52,715 --> 01:11:55,446
"Here come the care fee ghosts."

1445
01:11:55,538 --> 01:11:58,178
"Care free ghosts."

1446
01:11:58,258 --> 01:12:01,018
"Care free ghosts."

1447
01:12:09,938 --> 01:12:11,898
It feels so strange, right?

1448
01:12:12,218 --> 01:12:14,498
We ghosts are out on
the beach to party..

1449
01:12:14,578 --> 01:12:16,018
..and have a blast.

1450
01:12:16,223 --> 01:12:20,515
Bhootnath, we ghosts
have the right to have fun.

1451
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,418
The biggest advantage
of being a ghost is..

1452
01:12:23,498 --> 01:12:24,858
..we don't need
any visa or passport.

1453
01:12:24,938 --> 01:12:27,538
We can go anywhere, any place,
any time and anyway we want.

1454
01:12:28,658 --> 01:12:30,698
Right, Aatmaram?
- I don't know, sir.

1455
01:12:30,941 --> 01:12:32,338
I am a poor man.

1456
01:12:35,696 --> 01:12:37,338
You lost with 15
- Love.

1457
01:12:37,723 --> 01:12:39,378
I've already lost.

1458
01:12:39,602 --> 01:12:42,218
But I really liked
one thing today, Robin.

1459
01:12:42,628 --> 01:12:43,498
What? My game?

1460
01:12:43,538 --> 01:12:46,298
No, I heard you say
'love' 15 times today.

1461
01:12:46,538 --> 01:12:48,698
"Mister, walk slowly."

1462
01:12:49,288 --> 01:12:51,818
"Be careful in love."

1463
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:53,578
Very nice.

1464
01:12:53,881 --> 01:12:55,634
The oil is wonderful.

1465
01:12:55,674 --> 01:12:57,578
Hey mister, this isn't the oil..

1466
01:12:57,658 --> 01:12:59,218
..it's the magic of my hands.

1467
01:12:59,644 --> 01:13:01,704
Once I make any vegetable..

1468
01:13:01,909 --> 01:13:04,532
..whether it's a Bengali or a Bihari
he can't stop licking his hands.

1469
01:13:04,665 --> 01:13:06,938
Khwaja, tell me one thing.

1470
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:08,858
Did you forsake the
sword and take up the ladle..

1471
01:13:08,938 --> 01:13:10,498
..or forsake the ladle
and take up the sword?

1472
01:13:10,538 --> 01:13:12,743
Insolent, audacious fool.
How dare you joke with me?

1473
01:13:13,058 --> 01:13:14,058
Sorry. Sorry.

1474
01:13:14,138 --> 01:13:15,578
I was only pulling your string.

1475
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:17,298
I was joking..

1476
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:19,338
But I'll be honest with you.

1477
01:13:19,518 --> 01:13:21,898
You really cook well.
- Thank you, mister.

1478
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,178
Not the food, you bore me too much.

1479
01:13:25,402 --> 01:13:26,858
With your hideous poems.

1480
01:13:26,898 --> 01:13:28,618
Why you..

1481
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:31,250
You pollute the
place where you eat.

1482
01:13:31,704 --> 01:13:33,378
Brother, can I sit here?

1483
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:35,418
Sitting.
- No, no.

1484
01:13:35,498 --> 01:13:36,658
It's sit. Sit.

1485
01:13:36,738 --> 01:13:38,167
Sit. Sit.

1486
01:13:38,975 --> 01:13:40,695
Brother, you love eating.

1487
01:13:40,815 --> 01:13:43,255
You talk to a Bengali about eating.

1488
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:45,135
A Bengali eats so much..

1489
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,414
..that he squanders his
entire money on eating.

1490
01:13:48,335 --> 01:13:51,895
That's why the food's
tasty but not nutritious.

1491
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:55,615
We eat for taste, not to wrestle.

1492
01:13:56,855 --> 01:13:58,815
What food do you get in Mumbai?

1493
01:13:58,895 --> 01:14:02,471
'Bhelpuri, Sevpuri,
Panipuri, Madam Puri, Amrish Puri.'

1494
01:14:02,537 --> 01:14:05,335
It seems like the surname
of the entire Puri family.

1495
01:14:05,975 --> 01:14:07,735
There's only 'Jhol'
(curry) in Bengali food.

1496
01:14:07,815 --> 01:14:09,335
'Fish curry, potato curry.

1497
01:14:09,455 --> 01:14:11,455
Curry, curry and more curry.

1498
01:14:11,575 --> 01:14:12,655
No, brother.

1499
01:14:12,735 --> 01:14:15,775
Before pointing finger at a Bengali
take a peak in your own wok.

1500
01:14:15,855 --> 01:14:17,695
What do you have in Mumbai's wok?

1501
01:14:17,815 --> 01:14:20,141
Except for the 'Puri' family
just a dry 'Vada pav' (Fritter).

1502
01:14:20,181 --> 01:14:21,455
Hey!

1503
01:14:21,695 --> 01:14:23,255
Vada Pav is the pride of Mumbai.

1504
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:25,135
'Bhelpuri, Sevpuri, Panipuri..'

1505
01:14:25,215 --> 01:14:26,775
..are the symbol of our unity.

1506
01:14:26,855 --> 01:14:28,335
And a person from
every community eats it.

1507
01:14:28,415 --> 01:14:30,175
And Mumbai has a specialty.

1508
01:14:30,255 --> 01:14:31,695
Here a person gets up
on a empty stomach..

1509
01:14:31,775 --> 01:14:33,015
..but never sleeps hungry.

1510
01:14:33,095 --> 01:14:36,655
And the credit goes to 'Bhelpuri,
Sevpuri, Panipuri and Vada Pav.'

1511
01:14:36,735 --> 01:14:38,935
Scoundrel refugee.

1512
01:14:39,015 --> 01:14:41,575
You lived, slept
and woke up in Mumbai.

1513
01:14:41,655 --> 01:14:44,895
But didn't you feel hurt
while insulting Vada Pav.

1514
01:14:44,935 --> 01:14:47,175
From today you're out
of the Royal Mansion.

1515
01:14:47,255 --> 01:14:48,735
Out!
- Out!

1516
01:14:48,908 --> 01:14:50,535
I was only having a discussion.

1517
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:53,800
And it's important for a
Bengali to win every discussion.

1518
01:14:56,043 --> 01:14:58,535
Fine, I admit I lost
this discussion. Okay.

1519
01:14:59,231 --> 01:15:00,255
Come on, say sorry.

1520
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:01,815
Now.
- Who's the boss?

1521
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:03,114
I am the boss. Who's the boss?

1522
01:15:03,254 --> 01:15:04,575
You're the boss.
- Now say sorry.

1523
01:15:04,735 --> 01:15:05,735
Sorry.
- Say sorry.

1524
01:15:05,775 --> 01:15:07,016
Say sorry.
- Sorry.

1525
01:15:07,056 --> 01:15:08,815
Say sorry sister.
- I won't say it.

1526
01:15:08,855 --> 01:15:10,735
I will say sorry but I
won't call her sister.

1527
01:15:10,775 --> 01:15:13,255
It's a wonderful
situation for an argument.

1528
01:15:13,512 --> 01:15:17,135
Robin would've made a
nice song on this situation.

1529
01:15:17,175 --> 01:15:18,601
But where is Robin?

1530
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:20,761
You girls are crazy.

1531
01:15:21,241 --> 01:15:23,681
Love, love, in everything
you want to get love.

1532
01:15:23,961 --> 01:15:25,441
Don't you have anything else to do?

1533
01:15:25,641 --> 01:15:26,641
What is your problem?

1534
01:15:26,761 --> 01:15:28,561
Why do you hate girls?

1535
01:15:28,761 --> 01:15:31,441
Did someone ditch you?
- One?

1536
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:34,401
If I start counting
you'll be jealous.

1537
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:38,481
All girls are crazy about money.
- Wrong.

1538
01:15:38,681 --> 01:15:41,041
There are some girls
who are crazy about love.

1539
01:15:41,201 --> 01:15:42,641
The example is right before you.

1540
01:15:42,801 --> 01:15:44,281
Yes.

1541
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:46,641
You don't even mention the name..

1542
01:15:46,761 --> 01:15:48,921
..for the one you
jumped from the 10th floor.

1543
01:15:49,161 --> 01:15:50,706
Instead you try to flirt with me.

1544
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:54,081
Oh...

1545
01:15:54,442 --> 01:15:56,001
Tina, what happened?

1546
01:15:56,733 --> 01:15:57,601
What happened?

1547
01:15:57,641 --> 01:16:00,601
Why should I take that greedy,
cheater's name?

1548
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:03,321
He first cheated
me and then killed me.

1549
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:05,441
He did what your father said.

1550
01:16:05,681 --> 01:16:06,681
What could he do?

1551
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:08,056
I lied.

1552
01:16:10,401 --> 01:16:12,081
After I died I found out.. Oh !

1553
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:14,441
..that Sam was never
shifted out of Mumbai.

1554
01:16:14,801 --> 01:16:18,982
In fact, he asked for a big money
from my dad to leave me and Mumbai.

1555
01:16:19,401 --> 01:16:21,801
And after taking the
money he went to Australia.

1556
01:16:21,968 --> 01:16:23,642
He completely forgot me.

1557
01:16:24,923 --> 01:16:26,401
He never loved me.

1558
01:16:27,248 --> 01:16:28,441
Sorry, Tina.

1559
01:16:29,038 --> 01:16:30,321
I am really sorry.

1560
01:16:32,241 --> 01:16:34,401
Forget it.
Give me a smile.

1561
01:16:35,554 --> 01:16:37,441
Smile. Tina.

1562
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:40,041
Tina, listen.

1563
01:16:40,081 --> 01:16:42,961
Tina, you always say why
do I sing meaningless songs.

1564
01:16:43,435 --> 01:16:45,537
I'll sing a
romantic-sweet song for you today.

1565
01:16:47,001 --> 01:16:48,201
But on one condition.

1566
01:16:48,691 --> 01:16:50,481
Before I sing you
will have to smile.

1567
01:16:51,001 --> 01:16:52,001
Now smile.

1568
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:08,641
"Its love that I see
in my beloved's eye."

1569
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:16,121
"I know you're restless.."

1570
01:17:16,343 --> 01:17:19,441
"..to cajole Hooda."

1571
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:25,481
"My confused heart's
finally at peace."

1572
01:17:41,313 --> 01:17:45,001
"O dark glasses,
what's your scene."

1573
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:51,801
"O long tresses,
what's your scene."

1574
01:17:55,196 --> 01:17:58,201
"What's your scene?"
"What's your scene?"

1575
01:17:58,431 --> 01:18:02,001
"Don't waste our time."

1576
01:18:03,754 --> 01:18:07,281
"Tell us clearly who do you want?"

1577
01:18:15,997 --> 01:18:17,841
"My throat's dry."

1578
01:18:20,241 --> 01:18:22,841
"Get me my favorite booze."

1579
01:18:26,223 --> 01:18:27,841
"My throat's dry."

1580
01:18:28,001 --> 01:18:30,641
"Get me my favorite booze."

1581
01:18:31,637 --> 01:18:35,121
"SAD 69, o beloved."

1582
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:36,801
"My throat's dry."

1583
01:18:38,351 --> 01:18:46,001
"You dwell in my heartbeats."

1584
01:18:46,482 --> 01:18:54,401
"I've brought what you
drink day and night."

1585
01:18:54,732 --> 01:18:57,921
"Drink until you're knocked out."

1586
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:02,561
"And come in my arms."

1587
01:19:03,977 --> 01:19:07,401
"Father's in the courtyard.."

1588
01:19:08,164 --> 01:19:10,481
"..and your lovers
at the threshold."

1589
01:19:10,744 --> 01:19:14,681
"How do I get in your house?"

1590
01:19:17,867 --> 01:19:19,641
"Father's in the courtyard.."

1591
01:19:19,801 --> 01:19:21,721
"..and your lovers
at the threshold."

1592
01:19:22,076 --> 01:19:25,161
"How do I get in your house?"

1593
01:19:25,369 --> 01:19:29,001
"How do I get in your house?"

1594
01:19:29,147 --> 01:19:32,601
"My father's gone away."
"And my lover's are hanging."

1595
01:19:32,799 --> 01:19:36,201
"My father's gone away."
"And my lover's are hanging."

1596
01:19:36,422 --> 01:19:39,881
"Now pack your bags
and run to Bihar."

1597
01:19:40,139 --> 01:19:43,441
"Now pack your bags
and run to Bihar."

1598
01:19:45,711 --> 01:19:49,201
"The heart's said to your heart."

1599
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:54,660
"I am in love with you."

1600
01:19:57,094 --> 01:19:59,601
"The heart's said to your heart."

1601
01:19:59,835 --> 01:20:02,348
"The heart's said to your heart."

1602
01:20:02,664 --> 01:20:05,301
"I am in love with you."

1603
01:20:05,504 --> 01:20:08,107
"I am in love with you."

1604
01:20:08,201 --> 01:20:10,850
"My friend just chill."

1605
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,576
"Come and fill my empty life."

1606
01:20:13,939 --> 01:20:19,158
"Be just as crazy as I am."

1607
01:20:19,566 --> 01:20:22,000
"Understand my dilemma."

1608
01:20:22,328 --> 01:20:25,201
"And fall in love with me."

1609
01:20:30,856 --> 01:20:35,474
"We're the best."
"We're the best."

1610
01:20:35,817 --> 01:20:38,971
"The ghosts of Royal Mansion."

1611
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:43,361
"The ghosts of Royal Mansion."

1612
01:20:43,553 --> 01:20:46,021
"We're each other's friends."

1613
01:20:46,061 --> 01:20:48,230
"We have no.."

1614
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:51,082
"We have no host."

1615
01:20:51,152 --> 01:20:53,641
"We're filled with joy,
let's have toast."

1616
01:20:53,869 --> 01:20:55,910
"We're the best."

1617
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:57,641
"We're the best."

1618
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,364
"The ghosts of Royal Mansion."

1619
01:21:00,463 --> 01:21:02,241
"We're each other's friends."

1620
01:21:03,735 --> 01:21:04,735
Stop it!

1621
01:21:05,681 --> 01:21:06,681
What happened?

1622
01:21:06,798 --> 01:21:09,641
I was dancing.
What do you want?

1623
01:21:09,994 --> 01:21:11,281
Hold on.

1624
01:21:11,926 --> 01:21:13,441
Sir, Royal Mansion's in trouble.

1625
01:21:13,892 --> 01:21:15,761
What? What are you saying?
- Yes.

1626
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:18,213
We were living there
peacefully until now..

1627
01:21:18,425 --> 01:21:20,616
..because your
property was disputed. - Yes.

1628
01:21:20,824 --> 01:21:22,959
But the dispute is over.
- So?

1629
01:21:23,351 --> 01:21:26,049
Your great grandsons
have joined hands.

1630
01:21:26,503 --> 01:21:28,331
They have agreed on
out-of-the-court settlement..

1631
01:21:28,481 --> 01:21:30,774
..and they're selling
the mansion and mill.

1632
01:21:30,931 --> 01:21:33,299
What? What are you saying?
- Yes, sir, it's true.

1633
01:21:33,564 --> 01:21:36,514
They will raze
everything down and build a mall.

1634
01:21:36,554 --> 01:21:37,357
Mall.

1635
01:21:37,397 --> 01:21:39,392
You know all my male fans used
to call me a 'Maal' (hottie).

1636
01:21:39,512 --> 01:21:41,121
You're still one, sweetheart.

1637
01:21:41,584 --> 01:21:44,425
Manoranjana! Oh, God!
This is devastating news.

1638
01:21:44,554 --> 01:21:46,289
If anything happens
to the Royal Mansion..

1639
01:21:46,329 --> 01:21:48,001
..then I'll be homeless again.

1640
01:21:48,818 --> 01:21:50,541
If this had been the British rule..

1641
01:21:50,688 --> 01:21:52,900
..I would've hanged
this man to his death.

1642
01:21:53,005 --> 01:21:55,939
Soldiers,
we will give our life, boss.

1643
01:21:56,287 --> 01:21:58,347
But we will protect the mansion.

1644
01:21:58,559 --> 01:22:00,613
Idiot, you're already dead
how can you die again?

1645
01:22:01,145 --> 01:22:03,476
Let's first find out
who's the buyer. - Yes.

1646
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:05,481
I think she has a point.
Who is this buyer?

1647
01:22:06,038 --> 01:22:07,927
Some builder called Bhooteriya.

1648
01:22:08,144 --> 01:22:09,866
Who told you?
- Technology.

1649
01:22:09,981 --> 01:22:12,385
I installed surveillance
cameras outside Royal Mansion.

1650
01:22:12,425 --> 01:22:13,062
Cameras?

1651
01:22:13,102 --> 01:22:14,875
And I just received
a MMS from that.

1652
01:22:14,943 --> 01:22:16,271
MMS.
- MMS. - See.

1653
01:22:18,197 --> 01:22:18,881
See.

1654
01:22:18,921 --> 01:22:20,001
That's Royal Mansion.
See. See.

1655
01:22:20,247 --> 01:22:21,476
Who's getting down from the car?

1656
01:22:21,516 --> 01:22:24,303
He's Bhooteriya.
He looks like a villain.

1657
01:22:24,343 --> 01:22:25,602
Yes, Manoranjana.

1658
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:31,905
Suresh bhai, thank you.

1659
01:22:32,138 --> 01:22:34,201
Ramesh bhai, congratulations.

1660
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,279
Bhooteriya sir, all yours.

1661
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,400
See, Guliyani.

1662
01:22:41,669 --> 01:22:43,764
When Bhooteriya sets
his eyes on something..

1663
01:22:43,804 --> 01:22:45,920
Yes!
- ..he always gets it.

1664
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:49,200
Yes! Now watch what
I do with this place.

1665
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:50,440
I will give it a complete makeover.

1666
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,920
But sir, what will you build here?

1667
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,480
I'll build a 5 floor mall.

1668
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,840
I've also thought of a name.

1669
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,098
Bhooteriya 5 Star Plaza.

1670
01:23:01,496 --> 01:23:03,440
Oh my god. What's this?
- It's run out of battery.

1671
01:23:03,605 --> 01:23:04,760
We'll go home and recharge it.

1672
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,311
Let's go to Royal Mansion. Follow me.
- Cadets. Comrades.. lets go.

1673
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,280
Oh, God. Look.

1674
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,320
Cheers.

1675
01:23:18,835 --> 01:23:20,840
Everything has been settled,
no problem.

1676
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,960
Cheers.

1677
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,557
Look at him. After giving us
pain they're drinking champagne.

1678
01:23:24,812 --> 01:23:25,951
We'll have to do something.

1679
01:23:26,053 --> 01:23:27,560
There's just one problem,
Mr Bhooteriya sir.

1680
01:23:27,798 --> 01:23:30,212
Heritage site status.
- No, sir.

1681
01:23:30,299 --> 01:23:32,320
There are two problems, sir.

1682
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,600
One is heritage site.

1683
01:23:34,668 --> 01:23:36,832
And second is... very big

1684
01:23:38,072 --> 01:23:40,840
Quiet. Ghost. Stop stammering.

1685
01:23:42,012 --> 01:23:43,012
Go.

1686
01:23:43,606 --> 01:23:46,120
Ask the architect to start work.
- Yes.

1687
01:23:46,383 --> 01:23:47,920
Tell him to make
the best construction.

1688
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:49,616
Mumbai will turn
into Shanghai later.

1689
01:23:49,656 --> 01:23:51,560
We'll build our own
mini Shanghai first.

1690
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:54,942
Stop!

1691
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:56,530
What the...

1692
01:24:01,417 --> 01:24:03,320
You're talking about
building Shanghai..

1693
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,720
..and the Municipality
doesn't have a clue.

1694
01:24:05,817 --> 01:24:09,234
So you're from the Municipality.
- No.

1695
01:24:09,325 --> 01:24:11,720
The Municipality is in my pocket.

1696
01:24:11,945 --> 01:24:13,129
Come here.
- Me?

1697
01:24:13,229 --> 01:24:14,920
Me... come here.

1698
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,920
Ma..ka..rand.
- Hey!

1699
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,320
Not Ma..kha..rand

1700
01:24:19,857 --> 01:24:22,886
That's Makhrand Marathe.

1701
01:24:22,926 --> 01:24:23,926
Maharashtrian.

1702
01:24:24,047 --> 01:24:25,840
The chief of Makad Company.

1703
01:24:26,095 --> 01:24:27,169
Get that?
- Yes.

1704
01:24:27,209 --> 01:24:30,320
Makad means?
- Makad means monkey.

1705
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:35,360
Ok. I was overhearing your
conversation quietly like a monkey.

1706
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:40,553
Is there a problem
with the heritage status?

1707
01:24:40,593 --> 01:24:42,139
No, no, no...

1708
01:24:42,313 --> 01:24:43,960
Say it. There's no problem.

1709
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,905
All your problems will be solved.

1710
01:24:45,997 --> 01:24:48,360
It's the rule of the world.
Give and take.

1711
01:24:48,818 --> 01:24:51,600
In the language of Makad
company you give and I take.

1712
01:24:52,002 --> 01:24:53,002
Name your price.

1713
01:24:53,527 --> 01:24:54,440
20...

1714
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,480
Lakh.

1715
01:24:55,534 --> 01:24:56,534
Quiet!

1716
01:24:56,938 --> 01:24:59,593
Look. 20 means 20 percent.

1717
01:24:59,633 --> 01:25:01,732
20 percent? Too much.

1718
01:25:01,864 --> 01:25:03,096
Don't try to be too difficult.

1719
01:25:03,136 --> 01:25:05,840
Otherwise it will take
just one bullet to kill you.

1720
01:25:06,294 --> 01:25:07,960
You have just one week.

1721
01:25:08,473 --> 01:25:11,363
Get me my 20 percent
and build your mall.

1722
01:25:11,813 --> 01:25:13,240
Makad's, let's go.

1723
01:25:15,123 --> 01:25:16,643
Guys, there's a twist
in the story.

1724
01:25:16,683 --> 01:25:19,003
Political twist.
- There's not twist.

1725
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:20,563
He's a rich man.

1726
01:25:20,678 --> 01:25:22,603
He'll pay the 20 percent.

1727
01:25:22,683 --> 01:25:25,248
The politician will get what
he wants and we'll be homeless.

1728
01:25:25,288 --> 01:25:27,833
He won't be convinced so easily.

1729
01:25:28,083 --> 01:25:29,163
He's a businessman.

1730
01:25:29,243 --> 01:25:31,426
He'll negotiate till the end.

1731
01:25:31,599 --> 01:25:33,573
That means we have some time..

1732
01:25:33,723 --> 01:25:35,603
..and a window of opportunity.

1733
01:25:35,683 --> 01:25:38,203
But until then we
can't just sit idle.

1734
01:25:38,429 --> 01:25:40,843
Revolt. Bloodbath.
Charge.

1735
01:25:40,923 --> 01:25:42,563
No point in screaming and yelling.

1736
01:25:42,603 --> 01:25:44,083
Think of an idea, Bhootnath.
- Yes.

1737
01:25:44,243 --> 01:25:49,683
I am thinking to over feed
him the Bengali sweets..

1738
01:25:49,803 --> 01:25:51,203
..and he'll get high blood sugar.

1739
01:25:51,243 --> 01:25:52,483
And he'll die of diabetes.

1740
01:25:52,523 --> 01:25:54,723
That's a stupid idea.
Aatmaram, what do you say?

1741
01:25:54,763 --> 01:25:57,123
What can I say, sir?
I am a poor man.

1742
01:25:57,203 --> 01:25:58,919
Robin, how about you?

1743
01:25:59,123 --> 01:26:00,803
I feel we should give
him a sound thrashing.

1744
01:26:00,843 --> 01:26:02,603
You can't even play
your guitar properly.

1745
01:26:02,683 --> 01:26:03,843
How will you give him
a sound thrashing?

1746
01:26:03,963 --> 01:26:05,803
I'll play the guitar.
- Quiet.

1747
01:26:06,563 --> 01:26:08,283
Can I say something?
- Yes.

1748
01:26:08,443 --> 01:26:09,884
In the year 1857..

1749
01:26:09,983 --> 01:26:12,083
Oh no, Not again. Common yaar.
Oh god, Again!

1750
01:26:12,243 --> 01:26:13,243
Silence.

1751
01:26:14,243 --> 01:26:16,243
It's important, you
will have to hear it.

1752
01:26:18,043 --> 01:26:20,763
combat, battle, struggle and War.

1753
01:26:20,883 --> 01:26:23,963
The first stage is
always intelligence gathering.

1754
01:26:24,203 --> 01:26:28,563
When you find out
your enemy's strength..

1755
01:26:28,643 --> 01:26:30,585
..and weaknesses,
you've won half the war.

1756
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:32,919
Then who will win half the war?
This shorty.

1757
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:34,923
I am Khwaja Akbar.

1758
01:26:35,003 --> 01:26:36,845
Alias Khwaja Akbar..

1759
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:41,203
I've decided that I
will go to the builder.

1760
01:26:41,243 --> 01:26:42,363
I will spy on him.

1761
01:26:42,443 --> 01:26:44,443
And I will find his weakness.

1762
01:26:44,523 --> 01:26:46,803
By selling him pills?
- Not pills.

1763
01:26:47,146 --> 01:26:49,043
I'll floor him with my acting.

1764
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:50,403
I've done many plays.

1765
01:26:50,483 --> 01:26:52,763
French, Romans, Countrymen.
Ceaser

1766
01:26:56,183 --> 01:26:57,483
You bloody fool.

1767
01:26:58,209 --> 01:26:59,763
How dare you talk about
acting in front of Manoranjana?

1768
01:26:59,843 --> 01:27:01,843
I was always casted
without the couch. - Idea.

1769
01:27:01,923 --> 01:27:02,683
What? Say it.

1770
01:27:02,723 --> 01:27:05,683
To make our mission successful..

1771
01:27:05,763 --> 01:27:08,883
..we need a cunning
actor like Manoranjana.

1772
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:10,803
Cunning actress?
- I mean successful actress.

1773
01:27:10,843 --> 01:27:14,163
Thank you. - So Manoranjana,
get ready for the mission..

1774
01:27:14,283 --> 01:27:15,363
Mission Bhooteriya.

1775
01:27:15,403 --> 01:27:17,883
"Here comes the carefree ghosts."

1776
01:27:22,015 --> 01:27:23,803
200 shops on 1 floor..

1777
01:27:23,883 --> 01:27:27,043
..which means 1000 shops
on 5 floors.

1778
01:27:27,563 --> 01:27:29,963
1 crore for 1 shop.

1779
01:27:30,227 --> 01:27:31,643
1000 shops...

1780
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:37,243
1000...crores.

1781
01:27:37,438 --> 01:27:40,123
"Carefree ghosts."

1782
01:27:40,363 --> 01:27:42,523
"Carefree ghosts."

1783
01:27:42,794 --> 01:27:45,760
Bhooteriya the king.

1784
01:27:47,017 --> 01:27:48,043
Come in.

1785
01:28:03,776 --> 01:28:05,477
"I won't give it."

1786
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:07,569
"I won't give it."

1787
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:09,483
"I won't give it."

1788
01:28:09,935 --> 01:28:11,678
Hi, I am Bhavna.

1789
01:28:13,286 --> 01:28:14,143
Bhooteriya.

1790
01:28:14,183 --> 01:28:15,563
Nice to touch you.

1791
01:28:17,286 --> 01:28:20,883
But without appointment
in my office..

1792
01:28:21,323 --> 01:28:24,803
If I had taken an appointment
then I would've been disappointed.

1793
01:28:25,243 --> 01:28:27,203
Good. Good.
You did the right thing.

1794
01:28:27,363 --> 01:28:28,363
You did the right thing.

1795
01:28:28,795 --> 01:28:31,443
What are you playing?
- Golf.

1796
01:28:31,738 --> 01:28:33,658
Will you play?
- Will you teach me?

1797
01:28:33,738 --> 01:28:34,738
Golf?

1798
01:28:34,978 --> 01:28:36,258
Sure. Sure.

1799
01:28:37,178 --> 01:28:38,258
Come, come.

1800
01:28:38,738 --> 01:28:39,738
Hold. Hold.

1801
01:28:42,378 --> 01:28:44,138
Now teach me.
- Yes.

1802
01:28:44,258 --> 01:28:49,098
In golf, the stick
should be hard and a good aim.

1803
01:28:49,258 --> 01:28:52,178
So that the ball goes
directly in the hole.

1804
01:28:52,378 --> 01:28:53,378
Like this.

1805
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:03,258
Mr. Bhooteriya, yes!
I need a favor from you.

1806
01:29:03,427 --> 01:29:06,018
Flavor? What flavor?

1807
01:29:06,218 --> 01:29:08,138
"I won't give it."

1808
01:29:12,077 --> 01:29:15,098
I want a space
in your 5 star Plaza.

1809
01:29:16,130 --> 01:29:18,618
But who told you about it?

1810
01:29:18,879 --> 01:29:21,458
We haven't even
started this project?

1811
01:29:21,863 --> 01:29:23,331
It's confidential.

1812
01:29:24,223 --> 01:29:27,099
I've hid it from everyone.

1813
01:29:27,418 --> 01:29:30,578
Don't worry,
even I believe in hiding.

1814
01:29:35,873 --> 01:29:37,178
Mr. Bhooteriya.

1815
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:39,058
Mr. Bhooteriya.
- Yes.

1816
01:29:39,347 --> 01:29:41,138
I've lost my key.

1817
01:29:41,263 --> 01:29:43,698
Please find it.
- Yes, sure, sure.

1818
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:44,900
Why not?

1819
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,418
It's not..

1820
01:29:51,891 --> 01:29:53,091
Do you see it?

1821
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:54,578
I am trying.

1822
01:29:59,218 --> 01:30:00,218
Found it.

1823
01:30:00,456 --> 01:30:02,258
Found it?
- Thank you.

1824
01:30:03,323 --> 01:30:04,687
Thank you so much.

1825
01:30:06,898 --> 01:30:09,738
Will you give me space?

1826
01:30:13,178 --> 01:30:14,178
I will.

1827
01:30:14,318 --> 01:30:16,658
As much as you want.
- You are so sweet.

1828
01:30:17,038 --> 01:30:18,138
Oh no.
- What happened?

1829
01:30:18,392 --> 01:30:21,098
See, in a hurry
I brought my car keys..

1830
01:30:21,273 --> 01:30:22,818
..but I forgot to bring my car .

1831
01:30:23,131 --> 01:30:24,658
How will I go back?

1832
01:30:26,124 --> 01:30:28,962
Only if I let you go.
- Really?

1833
01:30:29,002 --> 01:30:30,002
Yes.

1834
01:30:30,595 --> 01:30:32,839
Now will you really give me space?

1835
01:30:33,986 --> 01:30:36,778
But what will you
give me in return?

1836
01:30:36,938 --> 01:30:38,418
Everything.

1837
01:30:39,288 --> 01:30:42,978
Head massage.
Shoulder massage.

1838
01:30:43,544 --> 01:30:45,218
Body massage.

1839
01:30:45,538 --> 01:30:47,178
Full sensation.

1840
01:30:47,815 --> 01:30:50,018
I will touch your strong points.

1841
01:30:50,941 --> 01:30:53,458
I hope you don't have a weak point.

1842
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:56,968
My wife.

1843
01:30:59,836 --> 01:31:01,236
Are you scared of her?

1844
01:31:01,596 --> 01:31:02,796
Yes.

1845
01:31:03,196 --> 01:31:05,276
I was scared of her
when she was alive.

1846
01:31:05,436 --> 01:31:07,996
Now that she's dead,
I am still scared.

1847
01:31:08,236 --> 01:31:09,316
She's dead?

1848
01:31:10,516 --> 01:31:14,186
Yes. That's why she haunts
me every night in my dreams.

1849
01:31:15,287 --> 01:31:17,824
What happened to her?
- Nothing happened.

1850
01:31:18,356 --> 01:31:19,506
I killed her.

1851
01:31:20,119 --> 01:31:22,837
What?
- I burnt her alive.

1852
01:31:24,116 --> 01:31:25,116
Why?

1853
01:31:25,396 --> 01:31:27,188
She nagged me all the time.

1854
01:31:27,956 --> 01:31:28,977
I had a chick.

1855
01:31:29,649 --> 01:31:30,802
Beautiful chick.

1856
01:31:31,516 --> 01:31:33,039
We were having an affair.

1857
01:31:33,756 --> 01:31:37,546
When Lakshmi found out
she was jealous.

1858
01:31:38,689 --> 01:31:42,926
I thought...let's get her
out of the way forever.

1859
01:31:44,917 --> 01:31:46,876
Then? - Then what?

1860
01:31:47,356 --> 01:31:49,810
One day when
she set out in her BMW..

1861
01:31:50,516 --> 01:31:53,956
..I poured petrol on the car,
and set it ablaze.

1862
01:31:56,436 --> 01:31:57,845
I miss her.

1863
01:31:58,818 --> 01:31:59,756
The wife?

1864
01:31:59,796 --> 01:32:01,761
No, the BMW.

1865
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:04,120
It was worth 65 lakhs.

1866
01:32:04,996 --> 01:32:07,796
Actually,
Lakshmi's my weakness, Bhavna.

1867
01:32:07,993 --> 01:32:09,916
She doesn't let me sleep all night.

1868
01:32:10,076 --> 01:32:11,435
People are right.

1869
01:32:12,116 --> 01:32:14,116
Men become ghosts after they die.

1870
01:32:14,196 --> 01:32:17,079
But women are always a witch.

1871
01:32:18,434 --> 01:32:20,256
"I won't give it."
- Bhavna.

1872
01:32:20,421 --> 01:32:21,756
"I won't give it."

1873
01:32:21,836 --> 01:32:22,836
Bhavna.

1874
01:32:25,396 --> 01:32:27,556
So even though
Manoranjana was dead..

1875
01:32:27,636 --> 01:32:29,436
..she still entertained Bhooteriya.

1876
01:32:29,737 --> 01:32:30,436
Yes.

1877
01:32:30,476 --> 01:32:32,276
But only to know his secret.

1878
01:32:32,396 --> 01:32:34,476
But this Bhooteriya
seems like a dangerous man.

1879
01:32:34,556 --> 01:32:35,556
Exactly, sir.

1880
01:32:35,743 --> 01:32:37,850
And so, the ghosts of
Royal Mansion needs..

1881
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:41,556
..someone more dangerous than
Bhooteriya to teach him a lesson.

1882
01:32:41,683 --> 01:32:43,276
But where will we find such a man?

1883
01:32:43,356 --> 01:32:44,916
On Spookbook.

1884
01:32:45,076 --> 01:32:46,355
Spookbook?
- Yes!

1885
01:32:46,395 --> 01:32:48,476
It's a social
networking site for all the ghosts.

1886
01:32:48,556 --> 01:32:49,876
We'll definitely find someone here.

1887
01:32:49,956 --> 01:32:52,716
And their slogan is... "Ghost.
Let's strengthen relationships".

1888
01:32:52,933 --> 01:32:55,476
And they found the man
they were looking for.

1889
01:32:55,516 --> 01:32:57,793
He lost an arm when he was kid
while making a local bomb.

1890
01:32:58,156 --> 01:33:00,300
And since them people
started calling him Babu Hathkata.

1891
01:33:10,417 --> 01:33:13,716
What kinds of ghosts are you
that are scared of a gun?

1892
01:33:14,145 --> 01:33:15,860
If I don't take
this out before I sit..

1893
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:17,991
..then it pricks
in the wrong places.

1894
01:33:18,031 --> 01:33:19,676
Babu bhai, how are you?

1895
01:33:25,232 --> 01:33:26,236
Babu bhai, how are you?

1896
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:29,716
Uncle, don't try to be
too friendly.

1897
01:33:29,796 --> 01:33:32,156
Get to the business, who do
you want to get out of the way?

1898
01:33:32,437 --> 01:33:35,420
No mercy, no forgiveness,
all I need is one blow.

1899
01:33:35,577 --> 01:33:38,470
No, no, Babu bhai,
we're non-violent ghosts.

1900
01:33:38,552 --> 01:33:39,552
Non-violent ghosts.

1901
01:33:39,606 --> 01:33:41,276
You Idiot.

1902
01:33:41,816 --> 01:33:45,491
Did you call me here
to play the violin?

1903
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,796
Actually we're in trouble.

1904
01:33:48,127 --> 01:33:51,981
If you don't help us,
then my house..

1905
01:33:52,290 --> 01:33:53,916
This is a true war, mister.

1906
01:33:54,192 --> 01:33:56,152
And you'll receive merits for it.

1907
01:33:56,242 --> 01:33:57,712
Idiot, sit down.

1908
01:33:57,952 --> 01:34:02,103
Merits won't do.
I need hard cash.

1909
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,392
Babu, please.

1910
01:34:03,432 --> 01:34:05,352
We're in big trouble.

1911
01:34:05,472 --> 01:34:06,832
Help us, Babu.

1912
01:34:10,935 --> 01:34:15,837
This gorgeous girl
called me Babu, not brother.

1913
01:34:16,094 --> 01:34:18,336
So I cannot refuse her request.

1914
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:21,712
Thank you Babuji bhai.

1915
01:34:22,112 --> 01:34:24,734
For helping us helpless ghosts.

1916
01:34:25,112 --> 01:34:26,338
You will earn merits for this.

1917
01:34:26,437 --> 01:34:27,530
Hey, uncle.

1918
01:34:28,112 --> 01:34:30,594
Keep your merits in your pocket.

1919
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:32,812
I did many good deeds myself.

1920
01:34:33,112 --> 01:34:34,858
I taught a boy to use the knife.

1921
01:34:34,898 --> 01:34:36,927
And he slit my throat one
day and dumped me in the drain.

1922
01:34:37,072 --> 01:34:39,200
Let's talk about money.
You can keep the merits.

1923
01:34:40,312 --> 01:34:42,178
Sorry, girls. I got too emotional.

1924
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:46,889
Don't worry. I will honor
you with a Queen's cross.

1925
01:34:47,232 --> 01:34:49,112
Who brought him here from London?

1926
01:34:49,192 --> 01:34:50,432
Did you pay his duty?

1927
01:34:50,632 --> 01:34:51,792
What did he just say?

1928
01:34:51,872 --> 01:34:53,512
He said you're a gem of a person.

1929
01:34:53,552 --> 01:34:54,632

He's the owner of
Bhooteriya Constructions.

01:35:03,792 --> 01:35:05,432
And his name is

01:35:05,512 --> 01:35:07,792

01:35:07,832 --> 01:35:12,632
No mercy, no forgiveness for him,

Your problem,

then you'll be at loss.

01:36:00,137 --> 01:36:01,897
If you listen,
then you'll make profit.

1960
01:36:03,457 --> 01:36:05,097

Babu..
- 20%, right?

1969
01:36:30,403 --> 01:36:32,777
Rascal,
if you give 20% to Makhrand..

1970
01:36:32,857 --> 01:36:35,218
..then what will you earn?

This diamond got a knack of

01:38:18,843 --> 01:38:19,923
You said he is Richmond?

2013
01:38:20,003 --> 01:38:23,323
It's the same thing.
Diamonds are same as Richmond.

I see.
So the deal didn't go through?

2024
01:38:45,763 --> 01:38:46,643
The deal didn't go through..

2025
01:38:46,683 --> 01:38:48,363

budge from their offer.

2026
01:38:50,723 --> 01:38:51,723

2042
01:39:29,962 --> 01:39:31,283
No need to worry.
No need to worry.

He's buying a property.

2052
01:39:53,523 --> 01:39:57,443
But it's been deemed
as heritage site.

2053
01:39:57,678 --> 01:39:59,123
Yes, yes, I know..

2054
01:39:59,311 --> 01:40:01,963
In the year..
- To hell with your years.

2055
01:40:02,187 --> 01:40:05,443
Now listen carefully
with both your ears.

2056
01:40:05,669 --> 01:40:08,523
If you don't cancel
that in two days..

2057
01:40:08,603 --> 01:40:10,483
..then you'll no longer be the CM.

2058
01:40:10,812 --> 01:40:12,443
Now hang up.

So can I leave?
- No, no.

2064
01:40:20,763 --> 01:40:22,883
Bhooteriya, we don't
let our guests leave..

2065
01:40:22,963 --> 01:40:24,963
..without showing our hospitality.

2066

"Make me your blanket.."

2082
01:41:53,123 --> 01:41:55,643

2085
01:42:13,255 --> 01:42:15,602
"Someone open the refrigerator."

2086
01:42:16,134 --> 01:42:18,302
"The temperature's rising."

2087
01:42:18,393 --> 01:42:20,963
"Someone open the refrigerator."

2088
01:42:21,176 --> 01:42:23,403

2093
01:42:39,009 --> 01:42:41,403
"I am such a cutie, sweetheart."

2094
01:42:41,897 --> 01:42:44,003
"My heat can melt ice."

2095
01:42:44,198 --> 01:42:46,403
"I can melt you too."

2096
01:42:46,682 --> 01:42:51,043
"If you touch me,
I'll fall in your arms."

2097
01:42:51,495 --> 01:42:52,542
"Wait.."

2098
01:42:52,609 --> 01:42:56,436
"Strike that matchstick.."

2099
01:42:57,357 --> 01:43:01,963
"Strike that
matchstick and light the fire."

2100
01:43:02,433 --> 01:43:03,433
"Come on."

2101
01:43:04,998 --> 01:43:06,912
"Come on."

2102
01:43:07,361 --> 01:43:08,739
"This girl's on fire."

2103
01:43:08,856 --> 01:43:10,087
"She can take you higher."

2104
01:43:10,161 --> 01:43:12,567
"She's your burning desire."

2105
01:43:12,724 --> 01:43:14,763
"She's a burning desire."

2106
01:43:14,843 --> 01:43:17,323
"She'll take you high."

2107
01:43:17,761 --> 01:43:19,923
"She's a burning desire.
- She's on fire."

2108
01:43:20,077 --> 01:43:23,000
"She'll take you high.
She's a burning desire."

2109
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,040
"Hey man.."

2110
01:43:24,929 --> 01:43:26,483
"No mercy, or apology."

2111
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:30,399
"All I need is one
blow to kill you."

2112
01:43:32,756 --> 01:43:35,289
"I'll make you the
bullet of my pistol."

2113
01:43:35,329 --> 01:43:37,563
"And fire all night."

2114
01:43:43,177 --> 01:43:45,498
"I'll make you the
bullet of my pistol."

2115
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:47,577
"And fire all night."

2116
01:43:47,617 --> 01:43:48,490
"I see."

2117
01:43:48,530 --> 01:43:50,704
"I can pick you up with one hand."

2118
01:43:50,816 --> 01:43:52,889
"Babu's very daring."

2119
01:43:53,275 --> 01:43:57,883
"I'll make sure your story.."

2120
01:43:58,163 --> 01:44:02,883
"..has a happy ending."

2121
01:44:03,942 --> 01:44:07,745
"Strike that matchstick.."

2122
01:44:09,072 --> 01:44:13,953
"Strike that
matchstick and light this fire."

2123
01:44:14,155 --> 01:44:18,802
"Strike that
matchstick and light the fire."

2124
01:44:19,253 --> 01:44:21,757
"You didn't need petrol,
or diesel.."

2125
01:44:21,926 --> 01:44:24,267
"Still she burned to ashes."

2126
01:44:24,367 --> 01:44:28,959
"You struck matchstick
and lit her on fire."

2127
01:44:29,512 --> 01:44:34,283
"You struck matchstick
and lit me on fire."

2128
01:44:34,643 --> 01:44:39,003
"You struck matchstick
and lit me on fire."

2129
01:44:39,635 --> 01:44:42,300
"You won't need petrol,
or diesel.."

2130
01:44:42,340 --> 01:44:44,652
"You set me on fire."

2131
01:44:44,864 --> 01:44:49,923
"You struck matchstick
and lit me on fire."

2132
01:44:51,623 --> 01:44:52,743
Lakshmi.

2133
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:55,263
Yes, Lakshmi, you rascal.

2134
01:44:56,783 --> 01:44:59,663
Lakshmi, but you were dead.

2135
01:44:59,743 --> 01:45:01,423
Dead, right?

2136
01:45:01,903 --> 01:45:04,283
But I am back as a ghost
to teach you a lesson.

2137
01:45:05,272 --> 01:45:06,863
Ghost. Ghost.

2138
01:45:07,783 --> 01:45:09,743
Save me, Mittal sir.

2139
01:45:10,063 --> 01:45:11,063
Help me.

2140
01:45:11,143 --> 01:45:13,211
No one will help you here.

2141
01:45:14,423 --> 01:45:16,703
Because we're all ghosts.

2142
01:45:25,023 --> 01:45:29,211
You rascal. You burnt me alive.

2143
01:45:29,581 --> 01:45:31,255
Now I will burn you alive.

2144
01:45:31,743 --> 01:45:33,143
You will suffer to death.

2145
01:45:33,223 --> 01:45:34,143
No, Lakshmi.

2146
01:45:34,183 --> 01:45:35,881
Don't forget I am your husband.

2147
01:45:36,143 --> 01:45:37,143
Your husband.

2148
01:45:37,183 --> 01:45:38,424
Husband.

2149
01:45:40,803 --> 01:45:42,143
Babu bhai, please save me.

2150
01:45:42,223 --> 01:45:44,023
Don't try to be too difficult.

2151
01:45:44,103 --> 01:45:46,317
Just die quietly. Get that.

2152
01:45:46,633 --> 01:45:49,103
Babu bhai, I made a mistake.

2153
01:45:49,183 --> 01:45:49,983
Forgive me.

2154
01:45:50,023 --> 01:45:51,515
Keep the money.

2155
01:45:51,659 --> 01:45:53,719
I'll send you 20 Cr. more.

2156
01:45:54,058 --> 01:45:55,103
Let me go.

2157
01:45:55,183 --> 01:45:56,383
Here you go.

2158
01:45:57,264 --> 01:45:58,983
I'll pour alcohol on his body..

2159
01:45:59,113 --> 01:46:01,583
..and you set his body on fire.

2160
01:46:02,943 --> 01:46:04,183
Stop, Lakshmi.

2161
01:46:04,482 --> 01:46:05,220
Let him go.

2162
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:06,435
Let him go? Why?

2163
01:46:07,419 --> 01:46:09,383
You know what he did with me.

2164
01:46:09,463 --> 01:46:11,863
He's the reason why my
soul's wandering around.

2165
01:46:11,943 --> 01:46:13,103
Don't worry, Lakshmi.

2166
01:46:13,335 --> 01:46:15,503
I will support your wandering soul.

2167
01:46:15,583 --> 01:46:17,663
And if he doesn't, then I will.

2168
01:46:17,743 --> 01:46:19,703
And if he doesn't, then I'm there.

2169
01:46:20,015 --> 01:46:20,743
What?

2170
01:46:20,783 --> 01:46:22,263
Like a sister.

2171
01:46:23,727 --> 01:46:27,143
If we kill him then even he'll
start living her as a ghost.

2172
01:46:27,387 --> 01:46:30,103
And then he'll spoil
our time-table. - Yes.

2173
01:46:30,143 --> 01:46:31,103
She's right.

2174
01:46:31,143 --> 01:46:32,501
He's got loads of black money.

2175
01:46:32,863 --> 01:46:34,663
And those who have black money..

2176
01:46:34,743 --> 01:46:36,343
..always die of heart attack.

2177
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:39,663
If he dies a natural death,
he'll go straight to hell.

2178
01:46:39,831 --> 01:46:40,623
Simple.

2179
01:46:40,663 --> 01:46:43,150
Go, Bhooteriya sir,
we forgive you.

2180
01:46:43,463 --> 01:46:44,463
Thank you.

2181
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:45,620
Thank you.

2182
01:46:45,663 --> 01:46:47,303
Thank you.
- Hey, smarty?

2183
01:46:48,219 --> 01:46:49,703
Do you think we're dumb?

2184
01:46:49,948 --> 01:46:51,235
Keep the bag down.
- Yes.

2185
01:46:51,275 --> 01:46:54,023
And send the other 20
which you just said.

2186
01:46:54,183 --> 01:46:58,663
Now get lost. - Wait Mr. Bhooteriya
You can't go like that.

2187
01:46:58,863 --> 01:47:00,520
Who is the boss? I am the boss.

2188
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:01,703
Who is the boss?

2189
01:47:01,863 --> 01:47:03,663
You are the boss.
- Yes.

2190
01:47:03,823 --> 01:47:06,463
So you'll be pardoned
only after hearing the boss.

2191
01:47:06,678 --> 01:47:08,223
Mr. Ramsay, play the music please.

2192
01:47:08,479 --> 01:47:09,983
Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

2193
01:47:13,263 --> 01:47:14,423
Friends.

2194
01:47:15,374 --> 01:47:16,543
Ghosts.

2195
01:47:17,682 --> 01:47:18,682
Human being.

2196
01:47:20,421 --> 01:47:25,436
You know...their
shopping malls, multiplexes..

2197
01:47:26,156 --> 01:47:29,823
..housing complexes,
high-rise towers..

2198
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:32,783
..have deprived
the poor of the sun.

2199
01:47:34,564 --> 01:47:37,381
Because of them, the
sky's getting smaller..

2200
01:47:37,517 --> 01:47:39,484
..for the children
to fly their kites.

2201
01:47:40,524 --> 01:47:42,764
With the pointed
edges of their towers..

2202
01:47:42,804 --> 01:47:46,036
..they are piercing
the heart of the skies.

2203
01:47:47,608 --> 01:47:50,672
That's when it doesn't rain,
it doesn't rain.

2204
01:47:51,564 --> 01:47:54,628
And when it does,
it wreaks havoc.

2205
01:47:56,044 --> 01:47:58,995
There was a time when there
were huge homes in the city.

2206
01:47:59,244 --> 01:48:01,599
With huge courtyards, lawns.

2207
01:48:02,249 --> 01:48:06,249
But today...the common man
makes many sacrifices..

2208
01:48:06,289 --> 01:48:10,526
..and pays EMI and what
does he get in return.

2209
01:48:10,684 --> 01:48:12,644
A small pigeon coop.

2210
01:48:15,524 --> 01:48:17,742
By stealing each foot, they're..

2211
01:48:17,939 --> 01:48:20,279
..pulling the earth
from below the poor.

2212
01:48:21,484 --> 01:48:23,485
They have left no
place for a grave either.

2213
01:48:24,324 --> 01:48:26,666
Graves are getting smaller..

2214
01:48:27,164 --> 01:48:29,456
..that a person feels
suffocated even after he's dead.

2215
01:48:29,604 --> 01:48:31,484
Move aside. I feel suffocated.

2216
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:32,600
Move.

2217
01:48:33,244 --> 01:48:34,380
Forget humans.

2218
01:48:34,724 --> 01:48:37,017
They've even made the
lives of ghosts difficult.

2219
01:48:38,444 --> 01:48:39,987
How have we harmed you..

2220
01:48:40,244 --> 01:48:42,760
..that you want to
snatch our peace and serenity.

2221
01:48:47,324 --> 01:48:50,324
Only to fill your
banks with more money..

2222
01:48:50,404 --> 01:48:52,379
..why are you throwing
us out of our homes?

2223
01:48:53,284 --> 01:48:55,988
Without thinking where
we'll go, where we'll stay.

2224
01:48:56,884 --> 01:48:59,004
In dustbins, the public toilet.

2225
01:48:59,084 --> 01:49:01,329
Or in one of the
trial rooms in your mall.

2226
01:49:02,404 --> 01:49:04,537
If you keep
constructing these buildings..

2227
01:49:05,444 --> 01:49:07,684
..then one day the
earth will cave in..

2228
01:49:07,764 --> 01:49:12,328
..under the burden of
the iron, metal and bricks.

2229
01:49:12,964 --> 01:49:14,766
The world was scared of ghosts.

2230
01:49:15,404 --> 01:49:18,444
But now ghosts are scared
of these real-estate demons.

2231
01:49:19,403 --> 01:49:21,680
So tell me who do we complain to?

2232
01:49:22,244 --> 01:49:23,542
Who do we talk to?

2233
01:49:24,204 --> 01:49:25,204
No.

2234
01:49:26,804 --> 01:49:28,804
You cannot understand our pain.

2235
01:49:29,604 --> 01:49:30,924
You're human after all.

2236
01:49:32,164 --> 01:49:33,468
And humans these days..

2237
01:49:33,508 --> 01:49:35,364
..don't understand
another human's pain..

2238
01:49:35,444 --> 01:49:37,644
..so how can they
understand a ghost's pain?

2239
01:49:38,204 --> 01:49:39,284
Go.

2240
01:49:39,903 --> 01:49:41,004
Go away from here.

2241
01:49:41,265 --> 01:49:42,804
Leave us to our condition.

2242
01:49:43,133 --> 01:49:44,284
Take him away.

2243
01:49:44,324 --> 01:49:45,324
Go.

2244
01:49:45,444 --> 01:49:47,804
Son, you're fortunate.

2245
01:49:48,332 --> 01:49:49,444
Now get out of here.

2246
01:49:49,604 --> 01:49:53,475
No mercy, or apology.
One blow is enough.

2247
01:49:54,414 --> 01:49:55,452
Let's go.

2248
01:49:56,204 --> 01:49:57,325
Get out.

2249
01:49:57,604 --> 01:49:58,604
Run away.

2250
01:49:59,337 --> 01:50:00,337
Get out.

2251
01:50:18,004 --> 01:50:22,129
Aatmaram, will you take me home?
- Of course, sir.

2252
01:50:22,435 --> 01:50:23,435
I am a driver.

2253
01:50:23,484 --> 01:50:26,004
And a good driver picks
his guest from his home..

2254
01:50:26,084 --> 01:50:27,308
..and also takes him back.

2255
01:50:27,444 --> 01:50:28,964
What a nice thing to say?

2256
01:50:29,333 --> 01:50:31,524
Are you a ghost too?
- I don't know, sir.

2257
01:50:31,741 --> 01:50:33,183
I am a poor man.

2258
01:50:34,764 --> 01:50:35,684
Very, very interesting.

2259
01:50:35,724 --> 01:50:36,924
Thank you thank you.

2260
01:50:37,111 --> 01:50:39,284
I didn't get one thing.
- Yes.

2261
01:50:39,558 --> 01:50:41,444
How did the ghosts find Lakshmi?

2262
01:50:41,524 --> 01:50:42,524
Spookbook.

2263
01:50:42,644 --> 01:50:43,604
What? Spookbook?

2264
01:50:43,644 --> 01:50:44,724
Yes, just like Facebook..

2265
01:50:44,764 --> 01:50:46,164
..ghosts have Spookbook.
- Nice.

2266
01:50:46,643 --> 01:50:47,594
Bizarre Boss.

2267
01:50:47,634 --> 01:50:50,604
Lakshmi accepted Tina's request.

2268
01:50:51,027 --> 01:50:53,484
And also her offer to
teach Bhooteriya a lesson.

2269
01:50:53,564 --> 01:50:56,364
But sir, the main problem
was doing a hot item number.

2270
01:50:56,602 --> 01:50:58,308
Because Lakshmi was a simple,
homely lady.

2271
01:50:58,348 --> 01:50:59,444
She didn't know how to dance.

2272
01:50:59,592 --> 01:51:01,548
Got it, Manoranjana Kumari.

2273
01:51:01,647 --> 01:51:02,644
And Tina, sir.

2274
01:51:02,684 --> 01:51:04,804
They both trained her.
- What a concept.

2275
01:51:04,884 --> 01:51:06,404
What a concept.
- Thank you, sir.

2276
01:51:06,672 --> 01:51:09,364
And these ghosts taught a
nice lesson to Bhooteriya.

2277
01:51:09,949 --> 01:51:12,204
I guess he never cast an
eye on Royal Mansion again.

2278
01:51:12,284 --> 01:51:13,284
No, sir, he came back.

2279
01:51:14,065 --> 01:51:15,244
In fact the next day?

2280
01:51:15,824 --> 01:51:17,111
With a witch doctor?

2281
01:51:20,914 --> 01:51:22,797
With the original
papers of Royal Mansion.

2282
01:51:29,065 --> 01:51:32,465
Bhooteriya transferred the property
back to the ghosts forever.

2283
01:51:32,589 --> 01:51:36,278
And once again there was
happiness in Royal Mansion.

2284
01:51:45,305 --> 01:51:46,505
And on this joyous occasion..

2285
01:51:46,585 --> 01:51:47,905
..Gaindamal allowed Gulabchand..

2286
01:51:47,945 --> 01:51:50,265
..in Royal Mansion as well.

2287
01:51:50,505 --> 01:51:54,625
And Manoranjana Kumari and
Gulabchand were together again.

2288
01:51:58,878 --> 01:52:01,425
What a story.
- Sir.

2289
01:52:02,385 --> 01:52:03,225
Sir.

2290
01:52:03,265 --> 01:52:05,145
What a story.
- Thank you, sir.

2291
01:52:05,265 --> 01:52:08,265
It's got characters, plot points,
cinematic moments.

2292
01:52:08,345 --> 01:52:10,465
Crises, and now I've
the resolution as well.

2293
01:52:10,545 --> 01:52:12,825
And a hot item number too.

2294
01:52:13,705 --> 01:52:16,905
Raju writer,
you really are a writer.

2295
01:52:17,025 --> 01:52:18,025
Thank you, sir.

2296
01:52:18,225 --> 01:52:19,265
Thank you.

2297
01:52:24,265 --> 01:52:25,305
I like it. My friend!

2298
01:52:25,665 --> 01:52:27,265
I like it very much.

2299
01:52:28,505 --> 01:52:29,947
But brother, you see...

2300
01:52:30,825 --> 01:52:32,385
..our story is very nice.

2301
01:52:32,505 --> 01:52:33,929
Not just nice, it's sensational.

2302
01:52:34,665 --> 01:52:36,277
But there's a small hurdle.

2303
01:52:36,665 --> 01:52:38,892
Hurdle?
- Not too much.

2304
01:52:39,025 --> 01:52:40,585
Our story's a bit whacky.

2305
01:52:40,625 --> 01:52:41,785
It's a bit weird.

2306
01:52:41,865 --> 01:52:45,508
So the producer might hesitate
a bit to invest in this idea.

2307
01:52:46,128 --> 01:52:47,987
But I will manage.
I'll do it. Not to worry.

2308
01:52:50,105 --> 01:52:52,196
Sir, is that all?
- Yes, that's it.

2309
01:53:05,145 --> 01:53:07,967
What's this? - See it yourself,
you'll understand.

2310
01:53:17,025 --> 01:53:19,825
These are coins during the
East India Company rule.

2311
01:53:19,985 --> 01:53:21,345
They must be really old, antique.

2312
01:53:21,425 --> 01:53:22,745
Not just antique, sir.

2313
01:53:22,785 --> 01:53:24,345
They are worth a fortune.

2314
01:53:24,425 --> 01:53:26,236
Enough for you to start your film.

2315
01:53:27,057 --> 01:53:28,057
Keep it.

2316
01:53:28,105 --> 01:53:30,280
We'll arrange for the rest too.
- Hold on.

2317
01:53:30,585 --> 01:53:32,745
First you tell me your story.

2318
01:53:32,825 --> 01:53:35,020
After that you also
arrange for the finance.

2319
01:53:35,343 --> 01:53:36,595
What do you want?

2320
01:53:37,765 --> 01:53:40,026
Sir, I want to see a film
being made on my script.

2321
01:53:40,305 --> 01:53:43,003
Sir, since I grew conscious,
I had just one dream.

2322
01:53:43,871 --> 01:53:45,545
Someday I'll be a film writer.

2323
01:53:46,185 --> 01:53:48,236
And someone will
make a film on my story.

2324
01:53:49,919 --> 01:53:52,105
With this dream and 400 rupees..

2325
01:53:52,185 --> 01:53:54,185
..I came to Mumbai from Allahabad.

2326
01:53:55,731 --> 01:53:58,766
Fought with my mother
and angered my brother.

2327
01:54:00,044 --> 01:54:01,185
I was worried as well.

2328
01:54:01,945 --> 01:54:03,465
But I was confident.

2329
01:54:03,905 --> 01:54:06,564
I knew that someday my
dream will come true.

2330
01:54:09,992 --> 01:54:12,185
Slowly my dreams
started shattering..

2331
01:54:12,953 --> 01:54:14,305
..and so did my faith.

2332
01:54:15,563 --> 01:54:17,545
Everywhere I went with my story..

2333
01:54:18,030 --> 01:54:20,188
..all I would get is rejection.

2334
01:54:22,025 --> 01:54:23,896
Everyone said
"Raju, forsake this profession".

2335
01:54:23,936 --> 01:54:26,095
You will only face failure.

2336
01:54:27,702 --> 01:54:29,905
But, sir,
I had heard a line in a play.

2337
01:54:30,808 --> 01:54:32,825
If a man has to be a failure..

2338
01:54:33,413 --> 01:54:36,985
..then it should be in
the work he wants to do.

2339
01:54:46,067 --> 01:54:48,545
You're successful now.

2340
01:54:49,694 --> 01:54:51,531
I am making a film on your story.

2341
01:54:53,208 --> 01:54:57,385
I am happy that I got
success at least after I died.

2342
01:54:59,231 --> 01:55:01,985
What?
After I died?

2343
01:55:02,865 --> 01:55:05,843
Sir, five months
ago I had no work..

2344
01:55:07,196 --> 01:55:09,240
..so I used to do
ghost-writing for many writers.

2345
01:55:09,588 --> 01:55:11,026
One day I was returning home..

2346
01:55:11,066 --> 01:55:13,145
..after finishing work.
And its raining heavily.

2347
01:55:13,457 --> 01:55:15,666
And I suddenly heard
a girl screaming.

2348
01:55:16,994 --> 01:55:18,065
Save me!

2349
01:55:20,305 --> 01:55:21,585
Save me!

2350
01:55:24,505 --> 01:55:25,505
Come on.

2351
01:55:25,665 --> 01:55:26,705
Come.

2352
01:55:27,264 --> 01:55:28,511
Who are you?

2353
01:55:28,905 --> 01:55:29,985
Come on.

2354
01:55:31,048 --> 01:55:32,048
Run!

2355
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:33,320
Run! Go.
Run!

2356
01:55:37,745 --> 01:55:39,065
Kill him..

2357
01:55:43,705 --> 01:55:44,825
Kill him.

2358
01:55:48,425 --> 01:55:50,105
And that is how I got killed.

2359
01:55:50,305 --> 01:55:52,465
I couldn't become a writer..

2360
01:55:52,585 --> 01:55:54,065
..but I definitely became a ghost.

2361
01:55:54,145 --> 01:55:56,385
After I became a ghost
I came to Royal Mansion.

2362
01:55:56,625 --> 01:55:58,682
Gaindamal sir gave me
permission to stay here..

2363
01:55:58,722 --> 01:55:59,820
..as a special case.

2364
01:56:00,727 --> 01:56:02,345
Then one day I wrote a story..

2365
01:56:02,505 --> 01:56:05,145
..about the joys, sorrows and
the sufferings of the ghosts..

2366
01:56:05,454 --> 01:56:07,145
..which I just narrated to you.

2367
01:56:10,512 --> 01:56:12,305
I must say you should start acting.

2368
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:13,985
You should stop writing.

2369
01:56:14,292 --> 01:56:16,047
That is how I got killed, sir.

2370
01:56:17,408 --> 01:56:18,785
You think I am joking.

2371
01:56:19,254 --> 01:56:20,894
I don't think. I know.

2372
01:56:20,987 --> 01:56:22,414
You're pulling my leg.

2373
01:56:22,614 --> 01:56:23,694
What's the proof?

2374
01:56:24,217 --> 01:56:25,037
You want proof?

2375
01:56:25,077 --> 01:56:26,526
Yes, I do.
- Come.

2376
01:56:54,094 --> 01:56:56,014
You want proof, don't you?

2377
01:56:56,814 --> 01:56:58,254
Curtain call, please.

2378
01:57:41,014 --> 01:57:42,294
Yes, Sumit.

2379
01:57:43,054 --> 01:57:44,974
Sorry, I fell asleep.

2380
01:57:45,054 --> 01:57:45,974
Very sorry.

2381
01:57:46,014 --> 01:57:48,854
You fell asleep,
but I am in a mess.

2382
01:57:48,934 --> 01:57:50,774
I had to travel in a
truck the whole day.

2383
01:57:51,214 --> 01:57:52,894
I guess I'll have
to give it a massage.

2384
01:57:53,014 --> 01:57:54,374
Let's go.
- Wait.

2385
01:57:55,414 --> 01:57:58,454
I just found out how
beneficial sleeping is.

2386
01:57:58,574 --> 01:57:59,654
How?

2387
01:57:59,894 --> 01:58:02,014
I heard a film story in my dream.

2388
01:58:02,303 --> 01:58:03,303
Almost a script.

2389
01:58:04,694 --> 01:58:07,534
Do one thing, go the
Guinness Book of World Records.

2390
01:58:07,894 --> 01:58:09,734
They will definitely
produce your film.

2391
01:58:10,014 --> 01:58:11,734
After all,
this will be the first film..

2392
01:58:11,774 --> 01:58:13,174
..which was written in the dream.

2393
01:58:13,668 --> 01:58:15,341
Give me a drag.
- Yes, sure.

2394
01:58:22,494 --> 01:58:23,774
What's this?

2395
01:58:28,934 --> 01:58:29,974
Aditya.

2396
01:59:14,374 --> 01:59:15,654
Number 1, take 1.

2397
01:59:15,734 --> 01:59:16,734
Clap.

2398
01:59:16,854 --> 01:59:19,074
And action.

2399
01:59:21,428 --> 01:59:22,428
Trolley.

2400
01:59:41,804 --> 01:59:44,445
"Here comes...
the carefree ghost."

2401
01:59:44,602 --> 01:59:49,174
"Dance to the tunes of
movie songs, sweetheart."

2402
01:59:54,734 --> 01:59:57,767
"Here comes...the carefree ghost."

2403
01:59:57,859 --> 02:00:00,534
"Dance to the tunes of
movie songs, sweetheart."

2404
02:00:00,614 --> 02:00:03,174
"On the beat of the drum,
tune of the banjo."

2405
02:00:06,094 --> 02:00:08,870
"Carefree ghosts."
"Carefree ghosts."

2406
02:00:09,029 --> 02:00:11,654
"Carefree ghosts."
"Carefree ghosts."

2407
02:00:22,987 --> 02:00:25,941
"If a ghost becomes
a movie star."

2408
02:00:31,134 --> 02:00:33,854
"If a ghost becomes
a movie star."

2409
02:00:34,141 --> 02:00:36,654
"He can even scare
Gabbar and Mogambo away."

2410
02:00:36,964 --> 02:00:39,454
"On the beat of the drum,
tune of the banjo."

2411
02:00:42,374 --> 02:00:45,094
"Here comes...
the carefree ghost."

2412
02:00:45,254 --> 02:00:47,974
"Dance to the tunes of
movie songs, sweetheart."

2413
02:00:48,174 --> 02:00:50,774
"Carefree ghosts."
"Carefree ghosts."

2414
02:00:50,947 --> 02:00:53,414
"Carefree ghosts."
"Carefree ghosts."

2415
02:01:04,694 --> 02:01:07,614
"He can show you a
movie without a ticket."

2416
02:01:13,269 --> 02:01:15,989
"He can show you a
movie without a ticket."

2417
02:01:16,069 --> 02:01:18,749
"He can patch-up
Sallu and Shahrukh."

2418
02:01:18,949 --> 02:01:21,589
"On the beat of the drum,
tune of the banjo."

2419
02:01:24,429 --> 02:01:27,069
"Here comes...the carefree ghost."

2420
02:01:27,229 --> 02:01:31,989
"Dance to the tunes of
movie songs, sweetheart."

2421
02:01:32,269 --> 02:01:34,749
"Carefree ghosts."

2422
02:01:34,909 --> 02:01:37,509
"Carefree ghosts."

2423
02:01:43,269 --> 02:01:45,909
"Carefree ghosts."

2424
02:01:46,109 --> 02:01:48,709
"He can even scare
Gabbar and Mogambo away."

2425
02:01:48,869 --> 02:01:51,469
"Carefree ghosts."

2426
02:01:51,629 --> 02:01:54,429
"He can patch-up
Sallu and Shahrukh."

2427
02:01:54,509 --> 02:01:57,109
"Carefree ghosts."

2428
02:01:57,309 --> 02:01:58,509
"Super-cool ghost."

2429
02:01:58,589 --> 02:02:00,109
"Ghost is no fool."

2430
02:02:00,269 --> 02:02:01,349
"Ghost is cool."

2431
02:02:01,429 --> 02:02:02,789
"Ghost loves swimming pool."

2432
02:02:02,949 --> 02:02:05,589
"Ghost life is damn cool,
beautiful."
