1
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,040
"God said, whenever I call"

2
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,520
"He will come for me"

3
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,760
"No matter how far"

4
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,320
"He will come for me"

5
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,760
"And God said whenever I call"

6
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,360
"He will come for me..."

7
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,760
No, it's like this.

8
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,760
"He will come for me"

9
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,560
"He will come for me..."

10
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,120
No, it goes like this.

11
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,440
"Come for me"

12
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,480
"He will come for me..."

13
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,600
Listen carefully.

14
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,040
"Come"

15
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,400
"Come for me"

16
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,720
Anju, darling, relax.
Come on, let's take a break.

17
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,800
-Bye, ma'am.
-See you tomorrow.

18
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,080
-Bye. See you. Bye.
-Bye, ma'am.

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,600
-Bye. Bye.
-Bye, ma'am.

20
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,960
Bye. See you.

21
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,800
-Anju, darling.
-Yes, ma'am.

22
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,400
Darling.

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,560
You know our school is celebrating Diwali
for the first time tomorrow, right?

24
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,440
So...

25
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,720
No, please.
My brother Sunny is coming tomorrow.

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,720
I want to give him a surprise. Please.

27
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,040
But, darling, your singing...

28
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,680
Okay. Why don't you sing
another section? Okay?

29
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,640
No, ma'am. Please let me.
I'll practice all day.

30
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,200
I'll sing well. Please, Sunny is coming...

31
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,200
Okay. You're going to sing, okay?

32
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,480
But, Anju, I didn't know
you had a brother.

33
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,920
Yes! Sunny!

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,600
Really? And what does he do?

35
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,720
Sunny is the you-know-who!

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
What?

37
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,400
He's a... He's...

38
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,480
'The One Who Knows.'
He is 'The One Who Knows.'

39
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,080
Sunny is 'The One Who Knows.'

40
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,560
"Everything and everyone
Is an open book to me"

41
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,360
"I'm watching everything you do
So you better tread carefully"

42
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,480
"Everything and everyone
Is an open book to me"

43
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,560
"I'm watching everything you do
So you better tread carefully"

44
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,120
"'The One Who Knows'"

45
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,240
"Take it easy, I'm here now"

46
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,040
"'The One Who Knows'"

47
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,160
"Ask me anything you need to know"

48
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,079
"'The One Who Knows'"

49
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,240
"Take it easy, I'm here now"

50
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,839
"'The One Who Knows'"

51
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,400
"Ask me anything you need to know"

52
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,080
"Guess who runs the show?
I play by my own rules"

53
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,280
"I can do as I please
The world is my personal playground"

54
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,240
"There is nothing that I can't get"

55
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,200
"It's like wishes"

56
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,960
"Waiting for me to grant them"

57
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,320
"Hey, people, who am I to you?"

58
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,320
"'The One Who Knows'"

59
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,880
"Yeah, take it easy, I'm here now"

60
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,560
"'The One Who Knows'"

61
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,840
"Ask me anything you need to know"

62
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,520
"'The One Who Knows'"

63
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,760
"Take it easy, I'm here now"

64
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,680
"'The One Who Knows'"

65
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,240
"Ask me anything you need to know"

66
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,360
"'The One Who Knows'"

67
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,920
Good going, Sunny Chopra.
You're definitely a writer!

68
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,760
What the...

69
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,920
Hey, Naani. Naani!

70
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,720
Naani, my love, my life.

71
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,960
Why can't we get this floorboard fixed?

72
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,560
Not "we," you!

73
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,320
It will be fixed the day
you call for repairs.

74
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,080
What? Me? When? How? Why?

75
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,040
Excellent, Naani! This is all I need.

76
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,600
Quiet. Come here.

77
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,840
What?

78
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,040
Thank you.

79
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Listen.

80
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,760
-Listen.
-Now what?

81
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,280
-Hey! What was that?
-Do not keep making fun of God!

82
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,120
Making fun?

83
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,960
Me?

84
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,880
At least I'm not half naked
when talking to God.

85
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,280
Hey, look. P3P claims his ninth victim,

86
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,880
Ms. Monica Martini.

87
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,200
P3P. Page three psycho.
After scaring the hell out of people,

88
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,360
with his pen-shaped knife,

89
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,880
stabbed Monica Martini seven times
last night.

90
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,320
Why seven?

91
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,240
-What?
-Why seven? Why not nine?

92
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,440
She is the ninth victim,
so it should have been nine stabs...

93
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,240
How would I know?
Maybe he got tired after seven stabs.

94
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,960
Here, take a look. Page three is empty.

95
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
People are scared to see their pictures
on page three.

96
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,120
Look at how they are hiding their faces.

97
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,720
They're afraid if P3P sees their picture,
they will be killed.

98
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,640
The reward to catch P3P is ten lakhs.

99
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,559
Cool. Let's go and catch him immediately.

100
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,640
Oh, how I wish that we get the ten lakhs.

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,880
That's good. You keep dreaming.

102
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,000
<span style="style.default_1">TIMES OF HINDUSTAN</span>

103
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,920
GYAN GURU SPEAKS

104
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,640
But, Naani, you are a Christian.

105
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,320
So why are you so excited about Diwali?
You have different beliefs.

106
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,600
That's the way I am, Sunny.
I believe in everything.

107
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,840
If you don't believe in Diwali,
at least let others believe.

108
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,320
No, Naani! Don't touch my table!

109
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,560
Pass me the cups.

110
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,120
I love you, my mess.

111
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,400
Naani, what are you doing?

112
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,920
Yes. Except for you,
the whole world celebrates Diwali.

113
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,920
-And you know the whole world?
-Yes.

114
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,920
Okay.

115
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,360
Naani, do you know Tatsuhiro Kuroda?

116
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,840
Yes.

117
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,880
Okay.

118
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,600
Sunny, don't you have to write
your script?

119
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,720
I can manage, Naani.
And Mr. Kuroda celebrates Diwali?

120
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,920
-Yes.
-Okay.

121
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,320
-Do you know Francois Ula Lalu?
-Yes.

122
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,200
And Mr. Ula Lalu celebrates Diwali?

123
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,400
Of course. Finish your work.

124
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,640
And Ping Tong Pahad?

125
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,720
Of course. I met him last month,
he also celebrates Diwali.

126
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,920
You're lying, Naani. You're such a liar.

127
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,600
There is no one called Ping Tong Pahad.

128
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,400
Liar. You're the president
of the liar society.

129
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,080
You're a super deluxe liar!

130
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,960
Hello?

131
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,080
Yes, Karan.

132
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,560
Yes.

133
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,800
Yes.

134
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,240
The logic is very important.

135
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,360
That's very crucial. Keep that in mind.

136
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,160
Don't worry. I have already solved it.
Yes, sure. Tomorrow?

137
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,720
Sure. I'll meet you tomorrow and explain.
Okay, bye.

138
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,000
And I'm the super deluxe liar?

139
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,680
Gokhale.

140
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,360
Dear, Naani. My brain is tired.

141
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,560
Don't feel like writing?
Why don't you help me?

142
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,640
Good idea, Naani.
Shall we go to the bedroom?

143
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,720
My brain is working now.

144
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,480
I can't do this.

145
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,640
List?

146
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,000
Gokhale, is Sunny...

147
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,040
Is Sunny on leave again?

148
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,880
Call him.

149
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,520
Gokhale.

150
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,120
Hello, Gokhale. I'm very sick.

151
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,880
I will have to go to the hospital.

152
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,400
I'm suffering from jaundice, malaria,
STD, ISD, and a lot more.

153
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,000
-Sunny?
-They need me Naani, I don't need them.

154
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,160
Tell me. Is it a must to be married?

155
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,200
I mean, why should we complicate our lives

156
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,840
with all these crappy rules
made by society?

157
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,800
Because these are followed by the world.
Simple.

158
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,840
Rubbish. It's hypocrisy.

159
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,640
Do you know how many married people
write to me every day?

160
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Just one lifetime seems like a hundred
Trust me

161
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,040
Is that why they say
marriages are forever?

162
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,440
Really, 'The One Who Knows'?

163
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,440
So, Naani, tell me.

164
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,240
-Do you want to get married?
-Yes.

165
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,960
So why did you pause before saying yes?

166
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,160
No way.

167
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,280
-You did.
-No, Naani. I...

168
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,960
Don't lie, Sunny.

169
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,360
Trust me, Naani.
I'm telling the truth. I'm not lying.

170
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,640
He is lying! Everything has a limit.

171
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,000
-Has he been coughing for two weeks?
-Yes, ma'am.

172
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,520
What yes? Get me his leave records.

173
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,320
Hey, how sweet. Your cousin Rajiv
has sent me a thank you card.

174
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,760
He got the job.

175
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,080
Job? What job?

176
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,440
At a call center.
My friend Suchitra is the manager there.

177
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,960
Isn't it great?

178
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,720
Why, Naani?
Why did you bother to get him a job?

179
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,280
If he really needed help,
he should have gone to

180
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,680
his Dad or his high-flying relatives.

181
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,720
Will 'The One Who Knows' have some coffee?

182
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,720
Yes.

183
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,760
When I needed help,
was there anyone around? Tell me, Naani.

184
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,480
-Everyone ran away at that time.
-I just arranged for an interview

185
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,120
he got the job on his own effort.

186
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,160
-Rajiv is a very sweet guy.
-Yes, sure.

187
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,560
Naani, for you, everybody is sweet.

188
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,840
Anyone can just smile and ask for help.
Naani, please help me.

189
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,840
Wonder woman Naani
will do anything to help him.

190
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,760
Sunny, what's wrong with helping anyone?

191
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,120
I think I did the right thing.

192
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,320
The right thing?

193
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,200
It's like a goat standing outside
the butcher shop and saying...

194
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,360
I kinda like this shop,
I will shop here today.

195
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,720
-So what should I do? Say no?
-Yes, Naani. Say no.

196
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,680
Genius! No...

197
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,600
Repeat after me. Say it with me. No...

198
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,680
-Naani, let's go to the bedroom?
-No, Sunny.

199
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,480
Exactly! No. Fantastic Naani, brilliant.

200
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,400
-The phone, Sunny. The phone is ringing.
-Naani.

201
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,440
I was serious.
Naani please let's go to the bedroom.

202
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,440
Hello. Dad. How are you?

203
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,080
Yes.

204
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,720
Sunny is out right now.

205
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,320
Yes. The interview is in the evening.

206
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,480
Sunny, have some coffee.

207
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,320
-What?
-What?

208
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,560
What was he saying?

209
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,840
Dad was asking if he can take
a ride with us tomorrow.

210
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,040
-And?
-And I said yes.

211
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,120
No, Naani. What did I teach you just now?

212
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,560
Call him and say no. Make up an excuse.

213
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,280
If you had to make an excuse,
you should have taken the call.

214
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,160
How the hell do I know who is calling?

215
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,200
But I thought you knew everything, Sunny.

216
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,320
Thank you, Naani. Thank you.
This is all I needed.

217
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,520
I'm hungry.
There was some special pizza offer.

218
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,520
Hey, Sunny.
Why don't you talk it out with your Dad?

219
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,920
Why? Who is he?

220
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,200
Sunny, at least don't talk about
your Dad that way. He loves you a lot.

221
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,240
Love? What love? Who loves?

222
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,280
Forget it.
Where did this love suddenly come from?

223
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,960
Now that I am 'The One Who Knows.'
Suddenly there is love.

224
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,880
There is Karan Johar.

225
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,920
Do you think these are the reasons
everyone loves you?

226
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,920
Yes.

227
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,520
-Me, too?
-Yes. No. I mean, it's only you who...

228
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,240
And Anju?

229
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,440
Yes. Just you and Anju.

230
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,640
And Dad?

231
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,000
-For how long have you known my Dad?
-Three years. He loves you a lot.

232
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,400
Twenty-eight years, Naani.

233
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,960
For him, the only right thing
is what he knows.

234
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,839
As if everyone else around is an idiot.

235
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,480
See? At least there is one thing
you have inherited from Dad.

236
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,480
Bad joke, Naani. That's not funny.

237
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,120
Hey, Sunny. This is a good joke. Listen.

238
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,880
The latest advice from 'The One Who Knows'
He says...

239
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,560
Avinash,
if you are having problems at home,

240
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,000
running away from them is not a solution.

241
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,400
You can leave your home and go,

242
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,680
but this will not make you happy. Ever.

243
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,160
Because it's only our family
that stands by us in difficult times.

244
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,920
You hypocrite. You can preach the word,

245
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,320
-but can't practice it yourself.
- I don't buy what I sell, Naani.

246
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,160
That's a very sad
and third-class philosophy, Sunny.

247
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,400
Such is life, Naani. Such is life.

248
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,160
Imagine. If someone comes around
and makes you buy your own advice.

249
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,280
Sell my advice to me?

250
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,040
There is no one like that on this earth.

251
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,120
Why don't you talk to your god?
To send someone from up above.

252
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,080
Happy Diwali.

253
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,880
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, dear.

254
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,000
-Happy Diwali.
-Happy Diwali.

255
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,160
What can I do for you, sir?

256
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,960
Wow! You make all these?

257
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,280
Pizza, large, small, medium, pineapple...

258
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,720
-As a Diwali special...
-White bread, brown bread...

259
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,200
Onion bread, garlic bread...

260
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,520
My wife Rama says at the end of the day,

261
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,440
everything is bread and vegetables.

262
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,040
Like 'Masala Dosa.' Bread and vegetables,

263
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,600
but a little different.
Do you sell 'Masala Dosa'?

264
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,280
-Sir?
-'Masala Dosa'?

265
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,680
Sorry, sir, we only sell pizzas here.

266
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,440
Oh, pizzas! Like vegetable sandwiches!

267
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,400
Bread and vegetables, but different.

268
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,560
Do you sell vegetable sandwiches?

269
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,760
No. sir. We only sell Italian food,
what people eat in Italy.

270
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,240
Italians don't eat vegetable sandwiches?

271
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,280
I'm sure they do, sir,
but we don't sell them. I'm so sorry.

272
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,360
-What do you want, sir?
-I want a job.

273
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,640
Sorry, sir?

274
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,440
A job.
I came to meet your manager Mr. Jose.

275
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,600
Dippy Uncle sent me.

276
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,160
Oh, so sorry, sir,
Mr. Jose has left for the day.

277
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,800
-You'll have to come back tomorrow.
-But Dippy Uncle said...

278
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,080
Excuse me, sir.

279
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,240
Hello, Mommy's Pizza!

280
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,880
Yes. Your address?

281
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,040
Okay. Thank you.

282
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,920
One large Super Special to go.
Time starts now.

283
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,480
A sprinkle of magic

284
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,120
A pinch of joy

285
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,200
A smattering of laughter

286
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,520
A dash of love

287
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,680
-A sprinkle of magic
-A pinch of joy

288
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,720
-A smattering of laughter
-A dash of love

289
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,840
Mixed into the sauce
Spread on the bread

290
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,920
-Dressed with some cheese
-Baked in the oven

291
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,080
And it's ready to eat

292
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,600
This pizza

293
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,000
The pizza

294
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,960
That satisfies not just your appetite
But also your heart

295
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,680
This pizza

296
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,280
The pizza

297
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,560
That satisfies not just your appetite
But also your heart

298
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,840
Give this to Rama. Don't worry,

299
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,960
by tomorrow all will be sorted.

300
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,920
But Dippy Uncle, it's Diwali in two days.

301
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,440
If the world can be created in six days,

302
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,280
then a lot can happen in two days.

303
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,360
Don't worry.
Everything will be okay before Diwali.

304
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,920
"Rawalpindi"

305
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,240
"Rawalpindi"

306
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,880
GOD BLESS ALL

307
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,560
Run. I'll cover for you.

308
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,520
Hey, Gungunani, why are you crying?

309
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,640
-Has someone died? Go!
-Your Father has died, you mutt!

310
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,080
-Wait, who is that for?
-202.

311
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,760
202? Okay.

312
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,800
Yes, he must have died from
hearing you sing.

313
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,400
-Son of a prostitute!
-Hello, Candies?

314
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,160
I'm calling for 201 Rosa Villa.
Cancel my food order.

315
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,240
It was some rolled foil crap.

316
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,440
Happy Diwali, sir. Here is your pizza.

317
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,280
Oh, thank you.

318
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,120
Sir! The bill, sir. It's 265 rupees.

319
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,880
-What bill?
-For the pizza, sir.

320
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,400
But you are five minutes late.
And as per your rules...

321
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,160
It's free of cost after 30 minutes.
So it's free!

322
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,440
No, sir. There is still two minutes to go.

323
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,120
Listen, trainee... Trainee?

324
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,120
-What's your name?
-Pundorikakhshya Purokayastha, sir.

325
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,280
-What?
-Pundorikakhshya Purokayastha...

326
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,560
-Come again?
-Pundorikakhshya Purokayastha...

327
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,760
Yes, okay.

328
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,480
-Do you know what this is?
-A watch, sir?

329
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,440
It's not just a 'mere watch,' Pundu.
It's an Omega.

330
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,960
And who wears an Omega?

331
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,840
-Who, sir?
-James Bond. Dude...

332
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,240
And Bond only has moments
to save the world.

333
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,680
If Bond's watch is a second,
just a second late...

334
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,400
Then that's it. End of world. Finished!

335
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,000
What do you think Pundu?
Would Bond let the world end

336
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,760
by wearing a 'mere' watch?
No, Pundu. No. Never.

337
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,760
If you're not five minutes late,

338
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,400
then how come we are alive?

339
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,520
-But, sir...
-Pundu?

340
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,320
-Do you know who I am?
-No, sir?

341
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,960
What the? Wait.

342
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,720
Now?

343
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,000
The One Who Knows! I had written to you
about my inflamed pimples...

344
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,680
Yes. I remember. Now tell me, Pundu.

345
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,360
Would I lie to you for 265 rupees?

346
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,840
Sunny, you do this every time!

347
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,560
-Hey, nice shirt, buddy.
-Thanks.

348
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,520
I haven't even worn it once.
Would I lie to you for 1800 rupees?

349
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,840
I paid you yesterday.
Would I lie to you for 100 rupees?

350
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,440
-Sunny, pay that boy...
-Naani, the bell!

351
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,320
Saved by the bell, Sunny
Saved by the bell

352
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,600
Saved by the bell, Sunny

353
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,200
Sunny, it's Pandey. Please open the door.

354
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,600
I'll just change.

355
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,440
Shit. It's Karan.

356
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,560
Hi, Karan. Yes.

357
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,080
I was working on your script only.

358
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,400
-How do you do Sunny?
-Hi, how do you do?

359
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,640
Yes. Let's discuss it tomorrow.
Let's work on it with a fresh mind.

360
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,560
Yes. I have solved that issue.

361
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,360
It's okay, Pandey.
Feel free to eat my pizza.

362
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,360
Yes, Karan. Yes. Tomorrow evening, then.
Okay, bye.

363
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,120
-Sunny, not evening. Afternoon.
-Not evening. Afternoon.

364
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,360
Pandey, what are you doing in my house?

365
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,920
Man, can you not get the one
with extra cheese?

366
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,720
Forgive me, Pandey.

367
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,320
Next time I won't even buy toothpaste
without your consent.

368
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,480
Okay.

369
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,960
Pandey, what are you doing in my house?

370
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,280
That man is crying again.

371
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,760
What? Why didn't you say that before?

372
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,200
Okay, Pandey. Get ready because any...

373
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,080
Sunny, the future is in chocolate pencils.

374
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,200
Plus, I have an interview... What?

375
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,440
The future lies in chocolate pencils.

376
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Kids today face too much tension
from studying.

377
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,240
They keep biting their nails.
I say, give them chocolate pencils.

378
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,400
Instead of nails,
they'll bite their pencils...

379
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,560
In an exam, whether they answer
their papers or not.

380
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,520
They'll bite up to at least
10 to 15 pencils, see?

381
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,440
So why don't you bite a pencil
instead of my pizza?

382
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,800
That's a very good joke,
but this is no time for jokes.

383
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,960
I have it all planned out.
I'll get the money, you do the marketing.

384
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,520
You make the ad.
I also have an idea for the ad.

385
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,000
A huge school, with lots of kids

386
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,160
all sitting and biting their nails.
And the camera...

387
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,920
Stop. Please, Pandey. Forgive me.
Have mercy on me.

388
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,160
See? I'm not worthy of
your brilliant ideas.

389
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,720
-No, but...
-No, I'm a misfit.

390
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,320
I don't have the balls.
I have only one solution for you.

391
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,240
Thank you.
Please find a woman for yourself.

392
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,280
Anyone, from anywhere.
And that will solve all our problems.

393
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,960
But you know I'm a celibate.

394
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:54,360
Pandey, please eat your pizza.
It's mine, but never mind.

395
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,680
Just like this house is mine,
but never mind. This TV is also mine...

396
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,120
Yes,
but this chocolate pencil idea is mine.

397
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,800
Hey, Naani, what are you doing?
Mr. Pandey, I will be back.

398
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,960
-Are you crazy?
-Sunny, this is not right.

399
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,640
One joke is the limit.
After that it becomes a habit!

400
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,600
But Naani, when it happens to me?

401
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,800
What the...
www.facebook.com/film1india

402
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,880
What the...

403
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,600
Eighty rupees?
It didn't even connect properly.

404
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,000
-But, sir, it's in the bill.
-What the...

405
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,240
-I don't have five rupees change.
-What the...

406
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,840
What rubbish, Sunny!

407
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,160
Sunny is right. The psycho egg seller...

408
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,560
Excuse me,
seven out of the 12 eggs are bad!

409
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,400
So why are you complaining to me?
Talk to the chicken.

410
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,400
What the...

411
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,360
"Rawalpindi, Rawalpindi"

412
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
What the...

413
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,520
-Trust me Naani, I know it.
-How?

414
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,480
What do you mean how?

415
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,440
Come on Naani. I am 'The One Who Knows.'

416
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,000
It's my job to know it all.

417
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,120
The 'Times Of Hindustan'
sells only because of me.

418
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,800
Sunny, who reads 'Times Of Hindustan'?

419
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,280
-I do.
-Thank you, Pandey.

420
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,640
Thank you. Please have one more pizza.

421
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,640
Whether inflamed pimples
or the secrets they

422
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,240
hide from their wives,
to the girlfriends they have on the side.

423
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,880
For any advice they need so badly,

424
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,320
People look up to me and listen carefully.
Why?

425
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,080
Because what is right and what is wrong...

426
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,240
I know it all.

427
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,680
Yes! He knows it all.

428
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,720
And for proof, one, two, three, four...
And there's the bell.

429
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,040
Pandey, ready!

430
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,160
-Good evening, Sunny.
-Good evening, Gungunani.

431
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,080
Good evening, Kalavati.

432
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,640
I hope I'm not disturbing you
in your work.

433
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,680
No, Gungunani.
In fact, I'm very happy to see you.

434
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,440
Tell me, what can I do for you?

435
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,960
Sunny, your toilet is overflowing again.

436
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,960
I was deeply engrossed in my singing
when two drops fell on my head

437
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,480
and rolled down from my forehead.

438
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,040
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.
I will be back in a second.

439
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,320
Really?

440
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,200
Gungunani, I'm really ashamed.

441
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,600
Sunny, don't apologize to him.

442
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,800
Just break his face,
so he that he doesn't sing again.

443
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,880
You left him loose.

444
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,680
Please forgive me. He's crazy.

445
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,160
He should be tied up.

446
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,840
Gungunani, forget about him. You know...

447
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,400
I have changed my toilet tap many times.

448
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,720
-Really?
-Yes.

449
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,520
But I think there is something
magical about your singing.

450
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,120
-Really?
-Yes.

451
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,840
-Do you think so?
-Yes.

452
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:24,200
-"Rawalpindi..."
-Gungunani.

453
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,800
Gungunani. Not here. Please.

454
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,280
Okay.

455
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,560
Whenever you start singing,
the tap just comes alive.

456
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,680
And the water starts to flow,

457
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,600
as if God himself has turned it on.

458
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,960
You know, the drops also fall right
on my forehead, like a blessing.

459
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,960
-Really?
-Yes.

460
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,240
It's a miracle.

461
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,720
In the olden days, Tansen
could make it rain with his singing.

462
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,760
No. You can't be serious.

463
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,720
Yes. Music has amazing powers.
It can even make it rain...

464
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:07,560
Yes, your singing makes my eyes rain.

465
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,960
Shut up, you ignorant imbecile.
What the hell do you know?

466
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,120
This is the pure form
of Raag Afgani Lohar.

467
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,040
Oh, shut up. If this is Raag Afgani Lohar,

468
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,320
then I'm the King of Japan
and Sunny is an African Gorilla.

469
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,440
What?

470
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,160
Shut up, moron. An imbecile like you
should be whipped naked on the road.

471
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,560
And a rotten singer like you

472
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,920
should be hung upside down on a tree
and taught singing.

473
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,840
Now, does shouting and fighting
like this suit you, gentlemen?

474
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,360
Gungunani, please carry on
with your practice.

475
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,240
With your permission.

476
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,440
And Pandey, you too, please.

477
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,760
Pandey, forget about being a celibate.
Just find a woman for yourself.

478
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,680
Did you see his reaction?

479
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,320
God is blessing him with toilet water.

480
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,600
He is amazing.

481
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,160
Sunny, are you a kid?

482
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,800
No.

483
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,800
Do you want proof?

484
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,120
Sunny, you'll be late for your interview.

485
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,600
Let's see.
Go to bed, or go to the interview?

486
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,040
-Bed, bed, bed!
-Interview.

487
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:26,040
But, Naani, in the night,
I'll have no control.

488
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,600
I'll be at Aunt Thelma's tonight.

489
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,360
What are you saying, Naani? What is this?

490
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,840
Not now. Not tonight.
All this happens after marriage, right?

491
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,320
So let's practice from now on.

492
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,440
What rubbish are you talking, Naani?

493
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,880
So you still have a chance.
Do you want to get married?

494
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,480
-Yes.
-See? You paused again.

495
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,400
No.

496
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,040
-You did.
-No.

497
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,440
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to another live edition

498
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,199
of <span style="style.default_1">Hot Seat with Hitesh</span>.

499
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,040
<span style="style.default_1">Hot Seat with Hitesh</span> welcomes you all.

500
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,080
Thank you. Thank you so much.

501
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,440
Today, we will present two
very special guests for you.

502
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,280
One who raises big problems,
especially for us men.

503
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,120
Especially for us men.

504
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,880
And the other one has a solution
to all our problems.

505
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,360
Ladies and gentlemen,
here's a glimpse of our first guest.

506
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,160
No. You can take my body,
but not my heart.

507
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,240
I don't want your heart.

508
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:12,000
Leave me! You can take my body,
but not my heart.

509
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,480
But I don't want your heart.

510
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,040
You can take my body, but not my heart.

511
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,680
Shut up! Get it in your head.
I don't want your heart, okay?

512
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,800
Ms. Maya, thank you so much
for being on the show.

513
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,440
You're welcome.

514
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,040
Please, please sit down.

515
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:55,960
Well, Maya, you look very beautiful.

516
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,320
You have been a mystery for all of us.

517
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,240
People want to know so much about you.

518
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,120
You have done amazing films,
and regional films too.

519
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,480
You also speak Hindi so well.
You are from South India, right?

520
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,760
Whether it's South India or North India,
first and foremost, I'm an Indian.

521
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,560
Actually, I'm from Canada.

522
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,720
No?

523
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,320
Yes. I was only one year old
when I came to Mumbai.

524
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,480
Sir, you're here.
Have you been here a while, sir?

525
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,160
-No, I just...
-I'm so sorry, sir.

526
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,600
Let me introduce myself, sir.
I'm Mr. Boltu, sir.

527
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,400
-Boltu?
-Boltu, sir. Spot!

528
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,320
Excuse me, sir.

529
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,440
Idiot! Why didn't you inform me
that he has arrived?

530
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,560
No...

531
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,520
Your pen, sir. Sorry, sir. Let's go.

532
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,880
And I was only 13 years old
when I signed my first movie.

533
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,680
It's a South Indian movie with Mr. Vijay.
It had a fantastic dance sequence.

534
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,640
It was a big hit, my first film.

535
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,080
Come, sir.

536
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,400
-Is Hrithik here?
-No, sir.

537
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,920
What?

538
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,040
-Sir, actually, what happened...
-Hrithik didn't come?

539
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,880
Yes, sir.

540
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,080
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

541
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,080
-The Ms. Maya?
-Yes, sir.

542
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,520
-Cleavage Queen, Ms. Maya from South?
-Yes, sir.

543
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,960
"The body sways
The mind swings"

544
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,560
"Cuckoo, cuckoo
The heart sings"

545
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,240
"The body sways
The mind swings"

546
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,880
"Cuckoo, cuckoo
The heart sings"

547
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,080
Don't you remember the action?
It's like this.

548
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,360
"Cuckoo, cuckoo
The heart sings"

549
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,280
Maya!

550
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,800
Yes! Maya!

551
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,800
"The body sways
The mind swings"

552
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,280
"Cuckoo, cuckoo"

553
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,200
What a boring film, buddy. But Ms. Maya?

554
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,000
Wow, Ms. Maya...

555
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,600
"Cuckoo, cuckoo
The heart sings"

556
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,720
-Tell me something.
-What?

557
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:17,360
If you had one choice, just one choice...

558
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,000
Arjun, don't ask any further.
There is only one choice for me.

559
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,400
The one and only Ms. Maya.
I love you, Ms. Maya.

560
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,280
Come in, sir. Please relax here.
I will call for you.

561
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,320
-Thank you...
-Boltu, sir.

562
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,800
-Mr. Boltu.
-Thank you, sir.

563
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,480
"The mind sways"

564
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,320
"The body swings"

565
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,760
"Cuckoo, cuckoo"

566
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,000
"The heart sings"

567
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,480
"You're bugging me too much
Go away, crazy fellow"

568
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,960
Sir?

569
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,440
The floor is very dirty, isn't it?

570
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,960
Dirty? Spot!

571
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,320
Clean the floor.
Sir, we are ready. Let's go.

572
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,320
-What do you know?
-I know it all. Just ask.

573
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,640
Her bust size?

574
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,000
Thirty-eight, D cup.

575
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,880
-Her waist?
-It was 32, now it's 34.

576
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,520
-Favorite car?
-Shogun.

577
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,200
-Holiday spot?
-It has to be London.

578
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,680
-First bikini film?
-The Sea Queen.

579
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,080
First topless?

580
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,280
Never, but in the film The Good Girl,
in a shot, a bit could be seen.

581
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,800
I saw it again and again.

582
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,440
-Type of men?
-Tall.

583
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,000
With a sense of humor.
She likes her men to keep the top

584
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,400
two buttons of their shirts open. Really?

585
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,960
Trust me, I know.

586
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,360
Sir?

587
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,840
Oh, gosh. It's really hot.

588
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,480
Sorry. Spot!

589
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,640
Switch on the AC. Come, sir.

590
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,000
Ms. Maya, thank you so much.

591
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,080
We hope to see you back in
Hindi cinema soon.

592
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,360
Thank you.
Just give me a script, and I'll be ready.

593
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,720
I can't give you a script,
but I can give you a writer.

594
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,240
Well Ladies and Gentlemen,
get your hands together for

595
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,800
The one and only, 'The One Who Knows,'
Sunny Chopra.

596
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,120
-Thank you Sunny for being on the show.
-Thank you.

597
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,880
-This is Maya.
-Hi.

598
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,560
Favorite hero? Mithun.
Favorite film? Kasam Paida Karnewale Ki.

599
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,400
Favorite song? What's life?

600
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,480
First and foremost I would like
to congratulate you.

601
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,840
-Why?
-For your marriage.

602
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,840
You cheat! You broke my heart.

603
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,840
You ungrateful dog.

604
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,480
Sunny, are you okay?

605
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,440
We have heard that you are writing
the much-awaited script for Karan Johar.

606
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,720
Yes. The script.

607
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,480
Everyone here would love to know
what it is about.

608
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,160
So, please tell us something
about the story.

609
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,800
She likes serious modern mysteries.
You know? Film noire.

610
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,800
Sunny, the story?

611
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,480
You see, I can't reveal much
about the story.

612
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,160
Right now, all I can say is

613
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,040
that it's a different kind of mystery.

614
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,120
In which the woman
plays the main protagonist.

615
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,000
A woman is the central character.

616
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,880
And a married man falls in love with her.

617
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,440
And a married man falls in love with her.

618
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,720
And how that woman's breasts, no,
personality changes...

619
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,720
are the foundation of the story.

620
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,840
What?

621
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,000
That means that the husband, wife,
and... Ms. Maya?

622
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,160
We often see that after marriage,
a man loves the other woman more

623
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,280
than he loves his wife.

624
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,960
You mean to say that
men often feel they will lose their

625
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,240
independence after marriage.

626
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,040
Why do you think so?

627
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,240
First, as I see it,

628
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,840
he is tied to one single woman.

629
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,560
His responsibility increases.

630
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:30,960
His social circle drops to zero.

631
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:37,720
He cannot make any independent decision.

632
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,400
And most importantly,

633
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:46,920
and this is something very hard
for a man to accept,

634
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,960
All the other women lose interest in him!

635
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,240
Sunny?

636
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,640
Sunny?

637
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,600
You are an expert on marriage issues.

638
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,840
So what would you like to say?

639
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,840
Marriage...

640
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,360
-Marriage, about marriage...
-You paused again.

641
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,920
I think it's more about the bonding
of two bodies than soul...

642
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,080
I mean, two souls than bodies...

643
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,360
Hello! Madam Anju. Why aren't you asleep?

644
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,040
Yes, Anju, we are coming.
Of course, Sunny is coming.

645
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,200
No. Tell me first. Who loves you the most
in the entire world?

646
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,320
You.

647
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,920
I love you, too. Good night. Bye.

648
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,880
Happy? Okay. Now quickly say your prayers.

649
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,560
Mommy, what's the difference between
Diwali and Christmas?

650
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,560
Nothing. They're both the same.

651
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,280
So does Santa come for Diwali?

652
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,720
If he has the time, then he will.

653
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,120
If I call him? Will he come to me?
Get presents for me?

654
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,520
What did you wish for?

655
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,600
-Good night, darling.
-Good night, Mom.

656
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,640
Nancy, where is my alarm clock?

657
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,720
-I'm troubling you for no reason.
-No, it's no problem.

658
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,000
It's hardly five minutes from my house.

659
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,960
You remind me of Mithun Chakroborty.

660
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,240
He is my teacher. He's my hero.

661
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,200
-No?
-Yes.

662
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,480
No.

663
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,480
What is this life without your eyes

664
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,520
What is this life if not in your arms

665
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,480
Aha ha... Oho ho... Aha ha

666
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,520
Aha ha... Oho... Aha...

667
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,760
Do you have any doubt?

668
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,960
-How tall are you?
-Five feet, 11.5 inches

669
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,840
There was dialogue in my film.
Forget the five feet,

670
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,960
Let's talk about the 11.5 inches.

671
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,760
Is there a problem?

672
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,880
Oh, gosh.

673
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,160
Davidoff. Cool waters.

674
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,880
Yes! How do you know?

675
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,200
It's my favorite, too.

676
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,680
-But it's a woman's perfume.
-No. Not that.

677
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,920
I mean it's my favorite fragrance
on women.

678
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,560
-Oh, gosh!
-Hey!

679
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:14,480
Are you a fragrance...
I mean, are you blind?

680
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,480
Follow that car.

681
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,880
That's a foreign car, sir. Take a taxi.

682
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,640
What the...

683
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,800
What is this life Naani

684
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,160
Without Maya's arms

685
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,920
Oh, it's you. Hello!

686
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,800
Greetings, Sunny!

687
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,520
Greetings, Gungunani. Greetings, Kalavati.

688
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,560
Kalavati!

689
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,760
I have a small question for you.
Do you really think...

690
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,320
I can make it rain by singing?

691
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,640
I mean, do I have that power in my voice?

692
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,240
-No. Not a hundred percent.
-No!

693
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,280
I'm 120 percent sure it's there!
Gungunani.

694
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,200
Yes?

695
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,920
You surely do have the power, and...

696
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,360
Then I shall go tomorrow
to all the music companies

697
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,160
because the day after is Diwali,
and everything will be closed.

698
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,720
Yes, sure. Everything will close.

699
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,680
-But you do believe that.
-Gungunani, you are the best.

700
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,600
Really?

701
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:25,880
You're the best of the best.
You are the Tansen of modern times.

702
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,480
Forget about Tansen.
You sing better than Mohd, Rafi.

703
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,080
You are a very good human being.
Good night, Sunny.

704
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,680
Good night.

705
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,200
Let's go, Kala.

706
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,760
Oh, the house is this way. Let's go.

707
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,200
Oh, gosh.

708
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,960
Oh, Naani.

709
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,640
Sunny. Parvati saw you on TV today.

710
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,480
It's not a joke, Sunny.
I'm very serious and...

711
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,160
Oh god, Sunny. Think.
Why? What can be the reason?

712
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,480
'The One Who Knows,' really?

713
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,600
So what kind of knowledge do you give?

714
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,640
No, just the general about family, love,

715
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,440
affairs, and others...

716
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:54,080
Love affair? Interesting.
I must hear this.

717
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:02,080
You know. Like, 'I am in love with a girl,

718
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,920
but how do l tell my wife' type.

719
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,560
So, are you married?

720
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,760
No. No marriage stuff...

721
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,200
-Do you have a girlfriend? A fiancÃ©?
-No.

722
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,280
What? A handsome guy like you?
Girls must be crazy about you.

723
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,000
No... Yes! They are crazy about me.

724
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,760
But I'm waiting for her.

725
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,240
The one destined for me.

726
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:44,800
Okay. And what do you think?
Who is destined for you?

727
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:50,400
I don't know, but, like they say, Maya...

728
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,360
that in life,
you only get what you deserve.

729
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,160
What is it?

730
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,280
What the...

731
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,640
Pandey.

732
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,040
-How do you do Sunny?
-Hi, how do you do...

733
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,040
I'm absolutely fine.

734
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,360
Rasgullas.

735
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,840
Rasgullas.

736
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,520
My uncle got them from Calcutta.

737
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:34,760
And they are in my fridge because?

738
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,480
My fridge isn't working, you know.
It doesn't chill food properly,

739
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,960
and rasgullas must be chilled...

740
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,160
Thank you so much for
this piece of information.

741
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,800
Good bye. Good night.

742
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,040
Sunny, actually I have got an idea.
I have been thinking...

743
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,160
Pandey, listen to me.
Pandey, I have lots of work to do.

744
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,040
Listen. Today...

745
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,200
Give my regards to your uncle.
You may leave now.

746
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,480
Film producing,
that's where the future lies, Sunny.

747
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,160
-Film producing?
-Yes.

748
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,160
What about the chocolate pencils?
Kids biting their nails?

749
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,360
The plan and the research?
www.facebook.com/film1india

750
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,120
No, that's very risky. Very risky.

751
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,800
-And film producing isn't?
-No, apparently not.

752
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,120
See, it's like... My uncle made a film.

753
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,280
'Wedding night in a graveyard,' and...

754
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,400
What?

755
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,960
'Wedding night in a graveyard.'

756
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,080
-So I heard it right?
-Yes.

757
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,920
That's all I need. Go. Please, go home.

758
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,360
-Oh, no. Listen to me. It's perfect...
-Pandey, I'm telling you...

759
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,040
It's a perfect idea, my friend.
A love story with a horror backdrop.

760
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,640
You write and I'll produce it.
We'll earn lots of money.

761
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,880
Pandey. My dear Pandey.
Please try to understand what I'm saying.

762
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,040
You don't need to make
'Wedding night in a graveyard.'

763
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,640
You need to have a wedding night
before you go to the graveyard.

764
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,320
Sunny, my friend. You know I'm a celibate.

765
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:56,160
Pandey, my friend. Listen to me carefully.

766
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,320
Yes, tell me.

767
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,960
-The moon is always in the sky.
-Yes, it is.

768
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:06,560
-And water is always wet.
-Of course, it is.

769
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,480
And it's a fact that man needs a woman.
Bye.

770
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,760
Hey, wait a minute.
Are you trying to push me away?

771
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,000
Trying to push you away?
No. Pandey, go home.

772
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,160
-Okay, Sunny.
-Yes.

773
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,360
'Down with chocolate pencils.
Long live film producing.'

774
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,760
Shut up, Rawalpindi!

775
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,000
Pandey.

776
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,440
What the...

777
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,440
Oh, it's expired...

778
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,640
Thank you, Pandey. Don't mind if I do.

779
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,680
Hello!

780
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,480
-Hi, Sunny!
-Yes?

781
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,960
Sunny, this is Maya.

782
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,120
Hey, Maya. Hi. This is Sunny.

783
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,520
Oh, Sunny.
I couldn't recognize your voice.

784
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,920
Sorry, I was eating some sweets.

785
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:43,840
Really? It's so late.
Do you like eating sweets?

786
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,960
Yes. I'm crazy about them.

787
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,400
I'm calling late at night.

788
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,680
Hey, it's no problem.

789
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,680
I wanted to thank you. Yes. Really.

790
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,640
You gave me a ride, and helped me.

791
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,160
I felt very nice.

792
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,120
Hey, how could I not help you?
You didn't have a car.

793
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,440
-And it's five minutes away from my house.
-You know, in these times,

794
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,200
nobody does a thing for anyone
without a motive.

795
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,160
Yes.

796
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,560
But you are not like that.

797
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,200
So are we meeting tomorrow?
For carrot pudding?

798
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,880
Of course, I have never backed out
from any challenge.

799
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,560
Especially from
a carrot pudding challenge...

800
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:31,280
But Sunny, I'm amazed that we
are so alike. What a coincidence.

801
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,920
Did you ever imagine that carrot pudding
is my favorite desert, too?

802
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,000
Carrot pudding with raisins.

803
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,320
Never.

804
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,160
I never imagined that you can cook...

805
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,800
carrot pudding.

806
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:51,440
That's right.
I can also cook other things.

807
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,400
Like?

808
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,840
Like...

809
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,720
toast with jam and butter.

810
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,960
Okay, Sunny. Let's meet tomorrow.
Text me your address.

811
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,480
Hello!
Murali, keep all my March dates free.

812
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,080
What?

813
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,880
They're free?
But don't give them to anyone.

814
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,760
Just a minute, Murali.

815
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,480
-You?
-Good evening, ma'am.

816
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,560
-I was waiting for you at the studio.
-No, I got a ride. Thank you.

817
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,440
-Hi!
-Hey.

818
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:31,280
-I miss you so much right now.
-Yes. How is Aunty?

819
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,840
-She talks so much just like you.
-Thank you.

820
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,840
You looked very handsome on TV.

821
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,160
Yes, I know.

822
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,600
Are you all right, Sunny?

823
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,920
Yes. No. Naani, the script is draining me.

824
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,960
I don't know how will I finish it
by tomorrow. I don't feel like writing.

825
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,400
Good! I'm also getting very bored here.
Shall I come home?

826
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:59,240
No, Naani. I have lots of work.
I have to work on them. Bye.

827
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,960
No, please let's talk a little longer.

828
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,120
I'm in the mood to talk.

829
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:08,800
In fact, I'm in the mood
for a lot of things. Shall I come home?

830
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,040
No, Naani. I have lots of work.
I have a deadline. Please, I have to work.

831
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,640
Yes, I'll talk to you later.

832
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:22,080
What? Sunny is saying no?
What kind of day, I mean night, is it?

833
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,200
You know,
Aunt Thelma took me to the market.

834
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,600
Me in the market? Can you imagine?

835
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,920
-This is my mobile number.
-I was going crazy...

836
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,800
-Hello?
-Yes, Naani? What is it?

837
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,080
Are you listening?

838
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,200
Why did you come so late
from the interview? Did you go somewhere?

839
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,480
I want your address.

840
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,160
-Yes, with Ms. Maya.
-Who?

841
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,160
Ms. Maya, she was in the show.
She asked for a ride.

842
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,800
So, I had to drop her off
in the Hotel Grand...

843
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,880
Hotel Grand Beauty.
Sunny, that's two hours away.

844
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,680
You should have called for a taxi.

845
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:01,840
Yes. No, Naani. Ms. Maya's leg...

846
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,080
Her leg was broken, so I couldn't refuse.

847
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:10,000
Oh, my God. The poor lady.
It's good that you gave her a ride.

848
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,840
-Yes...
-See how difficult it is to say no?

849
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,240
Yes. Okay, Naani. I have to work now.

850
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,480
-Hey, text me.
-Hey, listen.

851
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,920
Anju called for you.
You are coming tomorrow, right?

852
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,000
-She is driving everyone mad.
-What is it, Naani?

853
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,720
How many times will you say it?
Will you keep on repeating it?

854
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,360
-I said that I'll go.
-Hey, why are you getting angry?

855
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,200
I'm no angry. I'm busy working.
This is important.

856
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,040
You people just don't understand. Bye.

857
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,680
Yes. I love you, too.

858
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,120
Pindi!

859
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,520
Shit...

860
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:20,840
Don't send. Don't send the text, Sunny.

861
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:43,400
Every single breath

862
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:48,640
Waiting anxiously

863
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:53,920
For the words I want to hear

864
01:02:54,120 --> 01:03:00,000
For the moment that he says them

865
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:05,080
Every single breath

866
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:09,800
Waiting anxiously

867
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,720
For the words I want to hear

868
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:21,840
For the moment that he says them

869
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:56,680
We are meeting tomorrow.

870
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,440
Look, Sunny. The moon is smiling.

871
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:28,160
Oh, what will you do, Sunny?

872
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,240
You're dead.

873
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,320
Hey, Naani. What should I do?

874
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,320
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

875
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:59,400
God, Naani always...

876
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:03,400
says if there is any confusion,
you show the right path to everyone.

877
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:10,240
God, am I doing something wrong?
I mean, if I'm doing something wrong

878
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,040
then just give me one sign.
I'll come on the right track.

879
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,680
Sorry.

880
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,640
Just one sign. Please.

881
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:30,480
No, no! Don't do it!

882
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,240
No, no!

883
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:36,440
For God's sake, don't do it. Please.

884
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,840
Rawalpindi.

885
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,200
Great. That's just great.

886
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,280
"Rawal"

887
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,960
"Rawalpindi"

888
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:15,200
"Rawal, Rawal"

889
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:21,440
"Rawal, Rawalpindi"

890
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:30,400
"Rawal, Rawal, Rawalpindi"

891
01:06:56,120 --> 01:07:01,480
Just any sign. Any time.
Just give me a sign.

892
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,840
"And God said, whenever I call..."

893
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,680
"He will come for me"

894
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,960
Yes, Karan. The script is ready.

895
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,760
Get up. You have to get up.

896
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,560
There is a lot to work on today.

897
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,760
The body sways
The mind swings

898
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:39,439
Cuckoo, cuckoo
The heart sings

899
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,960
The body sways
The mind swings

900
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,720
Cuckoo, cuckoo
The heart sings

901
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,880
The world is mad with love
It's singing Cuckoo, cuckoo

902
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,359
The earth and the sky
Sing in unison, Cuckoo, cuckoo

903
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:03,640
Oh, my god, Naani!
What are you doing here?

904
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,520
Sunny, why were you sleeping on the sofa?

905
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,720
Actually, I...

906
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,240
Naani, what time is it?

907
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,960
Oh, it's 11:00 a.m.?
I have to do a lot of work, Naani.

908
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,160
Forget about work, Sunny.
Let's go to the bedroom?

909
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:20,359
Naani, I need to brush my teeth.

910
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,240
Sunny is saying no?

911
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:42,240
Hello! Hi, Mom.

912
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,240
You've come out.

913
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,320
Will you please wait for a minute?

914
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,360
Outside?

915
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:23,760
BP uncle, who did you send to me?

916
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,280
And what am I supposed to do with him?

917
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,440
I'm sorry.

918
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,560
Happy Diwali in advance.

919
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,160
Thanks. I need water.

920
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,160
It's for you. It must be Anju.

921
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:59,240
-Hey, Anju.
-This is not Anju. It's Parvati Kakkar.

922
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:02,520
Parvati, I'm very sick. Sorry.

923
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:10,840
Sir, we really need to make a decision
about Sunny. I've had enough.

924
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:15,000
I cannot control him, and I'm not sure
if there is anyone who can.

925
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,160
Michael.

926
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:21,400
-Yes, sir?
-Look, I cannot offer you a job.

927
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:24,920
Yes, sir.

928
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,080
Look, I cannot offer you...

929
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,680
Okay. Tomorrow is Diwali
and Suresh is not coming, so...

930
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,480
Sir, if I have a job,
Rama will be very happy.

931
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,360
-Rama?
-Rama is my wife. She always says that

932
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,840
-I will never get a job.
-What?

933
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:37,920
Sir, I'm telling you.

934
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,720
I have never kept any job
for more than two days.

935
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,560
-No, but I...
-You're very nice, sir. Thank you.

936
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,880
-What has to be done?
-Just fill up the form.

937
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,080
-And the uniform?
-Yes, pick up the uniform.

938
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,720
-Thank you very much, sir.
-You're welcome.

939
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,240
"After thinking and understanding"

940
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:05,680
"Things properly"

941
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:10,800
"I'll do my work very carefully"

942
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:17,640
"I have promised myself"

943
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,680
"This time, it will be more than two days"

944
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:30,560
"This time, it will be more than two days"

945
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,440
I'll get it.

946
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,360
Sunny, there is a Ms. Maya for you.

947
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,280
Naani, I don't know any Ms. Maya.

948
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,680
Then why is she taking her clothes off?

949
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,960
What? I mean, what?

950
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,360
How do you do, Sunny?

951
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,080
Hi, how do you do...

952
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,800
Pandey, please give me my mug.

953
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,200
Give me my coffee, Pandey.
What are you doing here?

954
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,600
No, I don't even want to know. Thank you.

955
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,080
Pandey, here's some coffee for you.

956
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,440
-Thank you. Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

957
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,640
Good morning, Karan.

958
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,720
-Even you woke up late today?
-Hey, Sunny. It's your interview!

959
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,400
You know, last night,
I was watching a film.

960
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:00,040
-Which one?
-<span style="style.default_1">Wedding Night in a Graveyard.</span>

961
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,320
It's a horrible film, Naani.
You won't be able to tolerate.

962
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,440
No, not you, Karan.

963
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,280
Listen, Sunny. I have an idea.

964
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,520
It's okay.
We'll talk later in the evening.

965
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,920
Not today, Pandey.
We're going to my parents' house later.

966
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:11,960
Okay.

967
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,280
Yes. Okay. Bye, Karan.

968
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,760
Sunny, you wore a tie in the interview.
Where is it?

969
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,640
Yes. Where is it?

970
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,000
Sunny, I think Maya likes you.

971
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,600
Naani, I won't be able to go tonight.

972
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:31,520
What?

973
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,520
-What?
-What did you say?

974
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,160
Naani, I have a lot of work.

975
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:40,160
It looks like I won't be able to
make it tonight.

976
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,160
Relax. Just do your work.
We'll leave after you finish.

977
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,320
Yes, just look at how she looks at you.

978
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,520
Naani, you can go alone.
I can't work like this.

979
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,320
-I'll come some other day.
-Sunny, this is not fair.

980
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,000
Everyone is expecting you.

981
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,840
And what you're doing is fair?

982
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,680
I have so much work. Do you think
I'd stop it all just for a dinner?

983
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,200
Just a dinner?
Sunny, how can you say that?

984
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:08,520
You're visiting my family after so long,
and all these people who have

985
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,560
never celebrated Diwali are doing it
just for you and Anju.

986
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,160
Sunny, don't irritate me.
I'll wait for you.

987
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:18,120
You finish your work,
and then we'll leave. Okay?

988
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:22,600
Okay. I'll cook something special
for you all, okay?

989
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,560
-That's a very good idea.
-Okay.

990
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,040
What's okay? Have you gone mad?

991
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:38,440
Hey, Naani. You should go on your own.
I'll go there once I finish.

992
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:42,280
Naani, I won't be able to work like this.
It's a creative job.

993
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,240
-Please don't pressure me.
-You're also looking at her, Sunny. Wow.

994
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,520
Pandey, will you keep quiet?
Who is looking?

995
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:51,120
Looking at whom? What? Watch it quietly.

996
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,720
Can't you people understand?
I have to work.

997
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,480
How should I tell you?
I can't work like this. Leave me alone...

998
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,960
-Where...
-Shut up, Pandey! So that I can work.

999
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,880
-Are you serious?
-Yes, Naani. You go.

1000
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,880
-You are not coming?
-No.

1001
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,280
Work is only an excuse, isn't it?

1002
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,240
What do you mean?

1003
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,360
I mean, just because I invited Dad,
you are doing all this drama, right?

1004
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,360
You know what, Sunny?

1005
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,120
If I had a choice
between having a husband like you,

1006
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,680
or having a dad like yours,

1007
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,240
I would choose your dad any day.

1008
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,040
Then Sunny would be your brother.

1009
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,200
Pandey, one more time.

1010
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,040
Pandey, will you please go to your house?

1011
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:04,040
-What about this match?
-I don't care about the match.

1012
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,800
I have a lot of work. Go to your house...

1013
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:08,200
-<span style="style.default_1">Let Go of My Hand.</span>
-What?

1014
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,760
This is the name of our film.
The one that you'll write.

1015
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:13,440
It's about a woman's changing breast,
and Karan Johar will direct it.

1016
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,680
Pandey, have mercy on Karan at least.

1017
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:23,000
Pandey, now I'll go back there
to write, and you...

1018
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,240
Pandey? Hello!

1019
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:29,440
Pandey, you're still
thinking about the film, aren't you?

1020
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,040
Don't think about it! Think about a woman.

1021
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:36,400
Think about a woman.

1022
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,800
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

1023
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,160
-But I'm a celibate.
-What the...

1024
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,840
To hell with this celibate crap!
Find a sexy woman,

1025
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:53,440
and become a "celimate"!

1026
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,160
"'The One Who Knows.'"

1027
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:58,280
There is only one solution
to this problem.

1028
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,320
Forget about being a celibate,
be a "celimate"!

1029
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,080
-Okay, but what's a "celimate"?
-How would I know?

1030
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,520
Check in some man to woman dictionary.

1031
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,560
Go now.

1032
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,840
And <span style="style.default_1">Let Go of My Hand</span>?

1033
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,680
Just check if everything is okay.
We need to make this deal.

1034
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,840
-We just have one copy...
-Relax. It's okay.

1035
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,680
Where is the elevator?

1036
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:29,720
To get something, give something
To find something, lose something

1037
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,480
And carrot pudding

1038
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:44,160
To get something, give something
To find something, lose something

1039
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,640
And carrot pudding

1040
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:49,240
Carrot pudding is just an excuse

1041
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,520
Hey, Bunty!

1042
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:08,560
Sunny, don't be sentimental.
Make the pudding.

1043
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:21,480
Hello! Hotel Hindustaani.
Do you have carrot pudding? No?

1044
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:24,240
Hello? Yes, do you have carrot pudding?

1045
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,000
No? No, I don't want apple ice cream.

1046
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,080
Out of season? What the?
There is no season for having deserts.

1047
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,400
You don't even have little bit?

1048
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,160
Hello? Oh, it's you again.
No, I don't want that ice cream.

1049
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,040
Let him go to hell.

1050
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,840
Sunny, make it yourself.

1051
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:41,280
But what do you need to make it?

1052
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:46,360
Nothing, buddy. Just carrot, sugar, milk,
raisins. It's simple shit. Make it, bro.

1053
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,280
Cool.

1054
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,440
Hello! Laxmi stores? Send me some carrots.

1055
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,800
Michael, you do that in the army.
This is a pizza shop.

1056
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,000
'Hunger is our enemy.
Customers are our friends.

1057
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:19,120
We are the soldiers

1058
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,720
who will defeat our enemy, in any shape,

1059
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,120
size or form, to save our friends.'

1060
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,760
-Soldier.
-Yes.

1061
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,040
Yes. Good.

1062
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,760
-Good?
-Good.

1063
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:38,680
-Sir.
-Yes.

1064
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,040
-I'll learn this book by heart.
-Yes.

1065
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,960
Lunch?

1066
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:48,400
Pizza!

1067
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,800
Sir, there is a delivery order.
Should I send that soldier?

1068
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,120
Please. Send him anywhere.
He's driving me mad.

1069
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:55,720
Okay, sir.

1070
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,520
Think, Sunny. Just relax, and think.

1071
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,720
Okay, what do we have?
Milk has to be boiled, right?

1072
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,280
Good. Boil the milk first.

1073
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,360
Okay, now the carrots.
Forget about the peeling, just cut them.

1074
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,360
Get a knife.

1075
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,040
Oh, no. I might break this.
Let me remove it.

1076
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,400
Oh, gosh! Oh, man.

1077
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,120
Sorry, Naani.

1078
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,280
Have you gone mad?

1079
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:00,040
We shouldn't even be together
let alone kiss.

1080
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,440
We have nothing in common.

1081
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,480
We have 'nny' in common.

1082
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,320
That's what I'm saying, nothing in common.

1083
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,600
No idiot. 'Nny' is common.

1084
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:18,920
What?

1085
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,480
'Nny.' You don't know that?

1086
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,920
-What?
-'Nny.'

1087
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:28,280
Firstly, we have nothing in common,
and to top it off, you are insane.

1088
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,680
This will be the end of our love story.

1089
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,120
Hey.

1090
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:39,400
'Nny' is common. Jenny. Sunny. See?

1091
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,600
Jenny. Sunny. 'Nny' is common.

1092
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:45,280
Now can we be in love. Now give me a kiss.

1093
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:48,080
This is the last time I'm doing this now.

1094
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:49,840
Whether we have 'Naani' in common or not.

1095
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:54,800
Oh, not Naani. 'Nny.' Look, 'Nny.'

1096
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,120
-Now say, 'Nny.'
-Naani.

1097
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:58,920
No.

1098
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:03,160
'Nny.' Watch and repeat.
Get the lips right. 'Nny.'

1099
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,440
'Nny.'

1100
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,040
No. 'Nny.'

1101
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,440
-'Nny.'
-Yes, baby.

1102
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:12,600
-So we have 'nny' in common.
-Yes.

1103
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,880
-So, I am your Naani.
-No.

1104
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,800
Okay. You're my Naani.

1105
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,400
Sure?

1106
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,320
Yes.

1107
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,680
Do you know what this means?

1108
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,480
What?

1109
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,560
That now you can't do anything wrong.

1110
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,080
What? Why?

1111
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:46,960
Because every time you do something wrong,
you'll remember me.

1112
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,840
-Why?
-You haven't heard the saying?

1113
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:52,600
'Every time you do something wrong,
someone will beat you up so much

1114
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,600
that you will remember your Naani.'

1115
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,520
Naani?

1116
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:18,680
Don't worry. It's just a saying.
Who will come and remind you of Naani?

1117
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:28,600
Happy Diwali, sir.
One large... What was it?

1118
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,920
Special pizza. Pan pizza.

1119
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,480
-Mommy's Pizza?
-Yes.

1120
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,200
It's your rule. If the delivery
is within 30 minutes, you pay.

1121
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,760
After that, it's free. It's free.
You're late.

1122
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:57,520
Sir, how can that be? I'm not late. How?

1123
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:03,360
I quickly wore the uniform.
Sir, this is one size smaller,

1124
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,800
but I still wore it,
then they made the pizza on time,

1125
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:11,560
and I came here directly.
So how can I be late, sir?

1126
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:12,800
Sir.

1127
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:21,080
'Time is of the essence.
A delivery person cannot be late.'

1128
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:29,000
Listen. Trainee?

1129
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:32,480
What is with you guys?
Trainee? What's your name?

1130
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:36,160
My name is Michael, sir.
And people generally call me

1131
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,480
Michael, sir.

1132
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:43,760
Okay, Michael.
Do you know what time it is?

1133
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,040
-You have a watch, sir.
-No, Michael.

1134
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,880
This is not just a watch.
This is an Omega.

1135
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,720
-What? Why are you laughing?
-Sir, it's just a common watch.

1136
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:55,880
Common?

1137
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,560
Firstly, you insult it by calling it
just a watch, and that it's too common.

1138
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,320
If James Bond had been in my place,

1139
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,400
he would have killed you.

1140
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,000
This is an Omega, Michael.
And Omega is never,

1141
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,240
I repeat, never wrong.

1142
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,320
-Never wrong?
-Never.

1143
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,160
But it's running fast, sir.

1144
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:14,680
Michael, do you know who I am?

1145
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,200
James Bond?

1146
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:23,000
No, Michael. I'm not James Bond,
and I can't be James Bond,

1147
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:26,720
because I said if James Bond was here.
Do you understand?

1148
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,320
There are two of us. Two different people.

1149
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:33,120
You have a twin brother?

1150
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:39,200
Oh, man, Michael, I'm scared.
Despite being Pandey's neighbor,

1151
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,800
I'm still scared, Michael.

1152
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:43,760
You really don't know who am I?

1153
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,120
No, sir.

1154
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,120
What the...

1155
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,320
Now?

1156
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,400
I get it. I'm with you.

1157
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,520
No. I don't recognize you at all.

1158
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:10,000
Oh, where is Mr. James? He was
a good man. What did you do to him, sir?

1159
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,960
Who are you? Sir, am I doing it right?

1160
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,440
What are you on about?

1161
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,840
Sir, you are pretending
to be someone else, right?

1162
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,640
I understood your game.

1163
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,720
Now, who will you act like? Donald Duck?

1164
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:24,480
No, Michael. No.
I have lots of work to do.

1165
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,320
You may leave. Good bye.

1166
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,920
-Sir.
-Yes, Michael?

1167
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:31,080
What about the bill, sir?
What will I say to the manager, sir?

1168
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,440
Tell your manager that you were late.

1169
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:37,240
An Omega is never wrong.
It is precise, all the time.

1170
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,360
-Trust me, I know.
-Sir.

1171
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,040
Yes, Michael?

1172
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:46,720
Happy Diwali, sir.

1173
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:50,080
Yes. Sure.

1174
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,040
BP uncle, what should I do now?

1175
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,400
Sir, what is the time, please?

1176
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:23,000
-It's 1:20 p.m.
-It's 1:20 p.m.? Sir, are you sure?

1177
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:28,760
-It's 1:20 p.m.
-Sir! Omega?

1178
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:30,600
-What?
-Omega?

1179
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:32,960
Okay.

1180
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:41,680
-Happy Diwali, sir.
-Yes. Sure. What is it?

1181
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:47,240
Sir, I'm not late at all.
I met a man downstairs.

1182
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,360
He was not James Bond,
but his watch showed the right time.

1183
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,600
-Michael...
-Yes.

1184
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,520
Michael, my friend, I have no time
for all this right now.

1185
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,320
You have no idea how much work I have.
Good bye.

1186
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,800
-Sir?
-Yes, Michael?

1187
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:03,840
My money, sir?

1188
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:07,640
Michael, here is one piece of advice.

1189
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:12,120
In life, you only digest the food
you earn from your hard work.

1190
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,040
So go and work hard, and earn your bread.

1191
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:21,360
Hello? Parvati! I'm very sick.

1192
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,480
-Sir?
-Quiet.

1193
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,640
Parvati. I'm in my office. I can't come...

1194
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:32,080
Parvati, I really... Oh!

1195
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:33,560
I really...

1196
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:38,120
'Customer is our friend and we
should always help our friend...'

1197
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,720
Sunny don't think I'm a fool.
This is serious.

1198
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:58,720
What are you doing? Why did you hit me?

1199
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,720
Sir, it's out.

1200
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,160
What's out?

1201
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,840
Whatever was in your throat.

1202
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,800
There was nothing in my throat.
It's only you in my house!

1203
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:08,800
Now, get out!

1204
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:14,400
Sir, please. My money...

1205
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:19,480
Michael, be glad that I'm not filing
a case on for entering my house,

1206
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:22,880
and beating me up. Now, get out!

1207
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,240
Oh, shit! The milk!

1208
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,840
I cannot bear the distance anymore

1209
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:51,880
Come to me, baby

1210
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:55,480
I am going to run with the wind

1211
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:57,960
Come run with me

1212
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:02,000
I want to open up my heart today

1213
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:04,800
I'm yours
Cuckoo, cuckoo

1214
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,120
I'm yours
Cuckoo, cuckoo

1215
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:11,160
What on earth are you doing?

1216
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,560
-Oh, gosh!
-My goodness...

1217
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,000
Who? Who are you?

1218
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:24,160
Who are you?

1219
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:31,040
Sir, I'm Michael. You are James Bond.
You fell and got knocked out.

1220
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:39,200
Oh, it's you. What are you doing here?

1221
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:42,680
I had asked you to leave...

1222
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:47,360
Sir. 'The customer is our friend
and we should always help our friend...'

1223
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,400
Not the book, please. Thank you.

1224
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,840
-Sir, are you making carrot pudding?
-Yes.

1225
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,400
Nobody can make carrot pudding
better than Rama.

1226
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,080
-Who's Rama?
-My wife.

1227
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,200
Okay.

1228
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:01,960
She tried to teach me
to cook so many things,

1229
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:04,680
-but I couldn't learn anything.
-A brave woman.

1230
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:06,760
I don't know how I learned to make
carrot pudding...

1231
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:09,480
Well done, at least you learned
something in life.

1232
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,520
Sir, you're a great person.

1233
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:30,920
Because you gave me a chance
to correct my mistake.

1234
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:35,280
When the manager finds out how much
I helped you,

1235
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:40,160
-he will never fire me.
-Yes, sure. Just make the pudding.

1236
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:41,920
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.

1237
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,520
Don't thank me. Make the pudding.

1238
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:48,160
Yes sir, 'the customer is always right.'

1239
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,320
Sir, Michael is not back yet.

1240
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:51,880
Good. Very good.

1241
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:56,640
Michael,
please brother I'm trying to work.

1242
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,760
-Sorry, sir.
-Thank you.

1243
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:05,040
-Sir.
-Yes, Michael?

1244
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:07,440
Sir, you love your Granny a lot, right?

1245
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:10,560
Yes. What?

1246
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,720
What rubbish are you talking now?

1247
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:18,520
Don't you know? Sir, when you
were knocked out, you were lying there..

1248
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:23,720
Sir, do you know what were you saying?
You were saying, Granny...

1249
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:30,240
Sir, do you know what Rama always says?

1250
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:34,520
No, but I have a feeling you will tell me.

1251
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:40,280
Correct. Rama says, in difficult
times one remembers the person

1252
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:42,360
he loves the most...

1253
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,960
Sir, for example, if you hit me
and I fall unconscious...

1254
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:47,760
How I wish.

1255
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,680
Then what will I say? Rama...

1256
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:59,160
Rama. Oh, Rama...

1257
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:02,200
Rama...

1258
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:08,000
-And the pudding?
-I'm making it, sir, with lots of love.

1259
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,040
Sir, where is your Granny now?

1260
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:21,880
I just don't want Sunny to be alone.
We'll come some other time.

1261
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:26,120
Thanks, Mom. I love you. Is Anju there?

1262
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:29,800
"And God said, whenever I call"

1263
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:33,000
"He will come for me"

1264
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,440
Thanks, Mom, Bye. I love you.

1265
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:45,760
-How do you do, Sunny?
-Hi, how do...

1266
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:51,760
Pandey will you please change clothes?

1267
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,600
Yes. I'm going to change history.
From today, I'll do karate,

1268
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:59,920
-dance, and yoga...
-Oh, Pandey. Why?

1269
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,040
No, I don't even want to know.

1270
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:04,360
Don't tell me.
You should go and change, please.

1271
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,120
Look, Sunny.
I'm going to run 50 miles, now.

1272
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:08,480
-How much?
-Fifty miles.

1273
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:10,480
You just keep track of the time.
What time is it?

1274
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:13,520
Today is Saturday. You should leave now.
We'll meet next month.

1275
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,200
-Why next month?
-Sir, the pudding...

1276
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,280
Who is he? Who are you? What pudding?

1277
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:23,000
This is Michael. He came to help me...

1278
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:24,960
-Yes, 'Customer is a friend...
-Michael, stop!

1279
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:28,160
-Just make the pudding.
-Yes, make the pudding.

1280
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,320
If we eat sweets before the shoot,
we'll have good luck.

1281
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:33,560
-Yes. Sure. Look there.
-Where? There is nothing there...

1282
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,680
-Yes.
-Sunny, by God, there is nothing there.

1283
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:43,400
-Hello, Sunny!
-Hello, Gungunani. Hello, Kalavati.

1284
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:46,840
I'm going to take the first step
of the new beginning.

1285
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:51,080
So I thought, before I start,
I should thank you again,

1286
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,280
and take your good wishes along.

1287
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:57,120
-Hey, you speak in Hindi!
-Yes. Oh, gosh!

1288
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,920
Yes, leave quickly,
and take all my good wishes with you.

1289
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:02,080
Thanks a lot. Let's go, Kala.

1290
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,880
My wishes are also with you.

1291
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:06,640
We're living in troubled times, Kalavati!

1292
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,560
-I have an idea.
-Even I have an idea.

1293
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:09,920
-What?
-I don't want to know.

1294
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,280
Here. Take this.

1295
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:31,760
Hello!

1296
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:35,280
What are you doing? Read the message.

1297
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:38,120
That's where we're going. Hurry up.

1298
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,480
Yes, ma'am.

1299
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,680
Hey, Michael. Pick up the phone.
The phone is ringing. Please.

1300
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:56,160
Hello? Yes, ma'am. One minute.

1301
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:01,560
Sir, there is a Parvati Kakkar for you.

1302
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:14,720
Ma'am, he's not at home.
He's at home. Yes.

1303
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:18,200
He's shaving. No, he's not shaving.

1304
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:20,720
He's in the bathroom.

1305
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,800
Oh, no. He's shooting...

1306
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:27,920
He is...

1307
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:33,200
He's in the bedroom.

1308
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:34,960
He's in the bedroom.

1309
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,880
He's saluting in the bedroom.

1310
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:41,680
He has a fever. Very good.

1311
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:45,680
He can't breathe very good.

1312
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:50,960
He's taking his last breath. He's dead!

1313
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,880
No, he's alive.

1314
01:37:55,440 --> 01:38:00,080
Sorry. He's in the bedroom. He's sleeping.

1315
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:07,080
He's sleeping in the bedroom.
And he's sweating, too.

1316
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:13,640
No, ma'am. He didn't die in the bathroom.
He's alive.

1317
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:18,560
Why are you so disappointed?
One minute, ma'am.

1318
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:20,200
Please hold on.

1319
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:27,920
Yes, ma'am. Okay. Then I take pause here?

1320
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:31,720
Yes. Okay. Just a minute.

1321
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:37,320
Okay, madam. Thank you very much. Bye.

1322
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:39,480
What did she say?

1323
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:49,400
She said, "If you don't come to work,
you'll be fired."

1324
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:50,880
Now, I'll pause.

1325
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:54,120
Rubbish! I'm not scared of her warnings.

1326
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:57,000
Don't mistake it for a warning.

1327
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:03,320
She'll fire me?
She'll fire 'The One Who Knows'?

1328
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,960
She'll fire me? The chances of me

1329
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:09,120
getting fired are as bright as the chances
of Pandey getting a woman today.

1330
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,560
She will fire me? Really?
Who will fire me?

1331
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:18,320
Michael, you tell me.
Who will get me out of the job?

1332
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,600
Sir, I don't know. I didn't ask.

1333
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:25,320
No, buddy. That's just the way I speak.
I told you, I'm a writer.

1334
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:28,800
Don't worry. I'm 'The One Who Knows.'

1335
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:30,840
Nobody can fire me.

1336
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:34,560
So Michael, how do I look?

1337
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:36,920
How am I looking?

1338
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:39,240
-Very smart, sir.
-Thank you.

1339
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:42,680
-Just like a film star.
-Is the pudding ready?

1340
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:44,360
Yes, sir.

1341
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:51,600
Delicious. Michael, you're not a cook,
you're an artist.

1342
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:56,760
Amazing! Okay Michael, my friend...

1343
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:13,320
you be made permanent as soon as possible.

1344
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:18,160
Not only that, but I'll forget that you
delivered my pizza late. Happy?

1345
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:21,160
-Thank you, sir.
-Don't mention it, Michael.

1346
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:24,480
That's what we are here for,
to help each other.

1347
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:29,240
'Give from one hand, take from the other.'

1348
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:32,240
Hey, Michael, not the book.
Okay, Michael. Thank you.

1349
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:33,920
That's it. Good bye. Let's go.

1350
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:35,680
-Sir...
-Yes?

1351
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:43,520
Happy Diwali, sir, to you
and to your Grandmother.

1352
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,040
What?

1353
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:47,520
Now I understand you.

1354
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:52,360
You are doing this for your grandmother.
You just can't express it.

1355
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,360
No, Michel. You don't understand.

1356
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:58,080
In fact, my Grandmother died
a long time ago.

1357
01:40:58,360 --> 01:40:59,280
What?

1358
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:04,680
Sunny?

1359
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:06,000
-Naani?
-Quiet.

1360
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,680
-Sunny why did you shut the door?
-Naani, I'm coming in a second.

1361
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:12,720
What should I do?
Run, and jump from the window?

1362
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:16,120
Shut up! Hey, Michael, I need you
to do something for me.

1363
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,640
Just one last favor, okay?
Naani is waiting for me outside.

1364
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:22,200
I have to go. You wait here. Don't move.

1365
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:26,320
A woman called Ms. Maya will come for me.

1366
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,960
Ask her to sit and wait, okay?
I'll be back soon.

1367
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,640
Sunny, open the door.
What's taking so long?

1368
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:36,600
Got it? Nod twice if you understand.

1369
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:38,840
Twice.

1370
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,480
Okay. Good bye, Michael. All the best.

1371
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,200
-Yes, Naani.
-Finally.

1372
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:47,000
Hey, Naani. Oh, sorry. Let's go.

1373
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:47,920
-Sunny...
-Let's go...

1374
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,200
What's happening?
Where are you going all dressed up, Sunny?

1375
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:52,320
Where are we going all dressed up?

1376
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:56,280
-We? What?
-Naani, you spoiled the surprise.

1377
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,560
-Is it a surprise?
-Meant to be a surprise.

1378
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,200
-Why are we running like thieves?
-Naani, do you think we're thieves?

1379
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:12,040
-Sir, have you seen him before?
-What?

1380
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:14,800
I mean, have you seen him around?

1381
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:17,800
No, sorry. Naani, do you know him?

1382
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:22,240
-How would I know?
-Sorry. Bye.

1383
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:30,520
Come on. What the? Oh, it started.

1384
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,360
You must have taken the wrong turn.

1385
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:44,320
His house is just five minutes away
from my hotel.

1386
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,480
-But, madam.
-Shut up!

1387
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:51,440
I'm sorry. I mean, shut up.

1388
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:43,680
-Darling, he is driving.
-I love you, Anju.

1389
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:46,880
Heard that? She says she love you, too.

1390
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:55,080
Yes, Anju, we are coming.
Hello! My battered died.

1391
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:04,400
-How come you never say that to me?
-What?

1392
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:05,680
I love you, Anju.

1393
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:10,840
That's because your name is not Anju.
I'm funny.

1394
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:12,960
You know what I mean.

1395
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:17,000
Stop this rubbish love scene
and hurry home! Maya is waiting!

1396
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:20,240
She's waiting, and my cellphone is dead.
Maya...

1397
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,760
-Did Sunny say something?
-Oh, gosh!

1398
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:29,360
-What time will he get back?
-He said he would be back soon.

1399
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:34,080
And you are?

1400
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:37,200
I'm his friend.

1401
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:40,000
And you work for Mommy's Pizza?

1402
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:43,600
Who told you?

1403
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:51,800
You're very smart.

1404
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:01,240
Are you okay?

1405
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:05,360
Where did Sunny go?

1406
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,400
-He went to his grandmother.
-What?

1407
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:11,160
I don't know everything.
You see, what happened was...

1408
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,760
Here is what happened.
First, Sunny fainted.

1409
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:17,720
And then he started remembering
his grandmother.

1410
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:19,360
Granny...

1411
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:23,000
When I asked him, he said
that his grandmother died long ago.

1412
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:26,480
And then the bell rang.

1413
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:33,160
So he opened the door,
and he got so scared as if he saw a ghost.

1414
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:35,440
Why?

1415
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,680
His grandmother had come back.

1416
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:42,880
Wait. I don't understand.

1417
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:45,960
Are you telling me that

1418
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:51,240
Sunny's dead grandmother came back?

1419
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:32,200
It was probably the sound of the wind.

1420
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,160
I think I heard a scream.

1421
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:36,880
That's impossible.

1422
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:38,680
There was no one there.

1423
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:43,320
You know, once, I was alone in my house.

1424
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:47,080
I opened the fridge, and someone sneezed.

1425
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:50,960
When I checked, there was no one there
except for a block of butter.

1426
01:46:57,120 --> 01:47:00,640
Did that butter sneeze ever again?

1427
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:10,480
I watched it closely for a week.
That was its first and last sneeze.

1428
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:16,000
But today is different.

1429
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:22,400
Today, I learned that ghosts ring
the doorbell to come in.

1430
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:30,640
Oh, gosh!

1431
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:33,520
Sunny!

1432
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:37,440
Relax, Maya. Just relax.

1433
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:58,680
-I'll meet you in a while.
-Okay.

1434
01:47:58,760 --> 01:47:59,600
Okay.

1435
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:03,560
-Hey, what the...
-Hey!

1436
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:19,040
Would you like some carrot pudding?

1437
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:23,120
-Carrot pudding?
-Yes.

1438
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:24,840
Of course.

1439
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:26,920
-Sir. Sir, please.
-Where is your license?

1440
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:29,360
-Sir, please let me go.
-Let me see your license.

1441
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:31,600
-Sir, I'm in a hurry.
-Where is your license?

1442
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:33,200
Sir, I forgot my license at home.

1443
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:36,080
That's too bad. What's your name?

1444
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:37,640
Sir, please let me go. I'm in a hurry.

1445
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:38,920
Don't waste my time. Your name?

1446
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:43,520
-Pundorikakshya Purokayashtha.
-What?

1447
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,720
Pundorikakshya Purokayashtha!

1448
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,640
Pundori...

1449
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:49,760
Pun... Pundo... Pundori...

1450
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:50,760
What the...

1451
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:53,240
Okay, I'm letting you go this time.

1452
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:56,320
Next time, don't forget your license.

1453
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,680
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1454
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:00,960
So you are producing Sunny's movie?

1455
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:02,440
Yes.

1456
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:04,960
Please sit comfortably.

1457
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,840
And this is the same one
that Karan Johar is directing?

1458
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:13,560
Yes. I mean, if Karan wants to,
then I have no problem.

1459
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:16,080
This is the same one
based on a woman's changing...

1460
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:19,640
Changing breasts. Yes, it's based on that.
Sunny told you?

1461
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:21,080
Yes.

1462
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:26,000
You like sweets, right?

1463
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:30,360
-Very much.
-I like sweets, too.

1464
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:34,520
-I eat a lot of sweets.
-Okay.

1465
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:36,760
I have a lot of sweets in my house.

1466
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:41,840
They're in the fridge.
My uncle got them from Calcutta.

1467
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:43,880
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1468
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,120
Where do you stay?

1469
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:51,560
Where do I stay?
I stay there outside the door.

1470
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:53,320
I mean, in the opposite apartment.

1471
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:55,200
Okay.

1472
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:00,280
Have you finalized who will play
the heroine?

1473
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:24,800
Sweets. I need more sweets.

1474
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:33,720
Carrot pudding...

1475
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,440
When I checked, there was nothing inside.

1476
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:06,600
Sir, where are you?

1477
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:15,200
Rama. Rama.

1478
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,280
-Michael, why are you outside?
-Sir, you're back.

1479
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:21,960
-Where's Maya?
-At Pandey's place!

1480
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:25,280
Pandey's place? Where's Pandey?

1481
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,960
Sunny, how do you do?

1482
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:29,400
Sunny, I have become a "celimate."

1483
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:32,520
No, Pandey. No.
Please come to your senses.

1484
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:34,280
Where's Maya?

1485
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:36,520
-Maya has left...
-What the...

1486
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:40,040
"I have become the Holy Lady!"

1487
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:47,360
Damn it!

1488
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:53,400
Pandey...

1489
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:59,840
-Oh, gosh! Parvati!
-You recognized me?

1490
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:07,320
-Happy Diwali, Sunny.
-Yes. sure.

1491
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:09,680
-You're fired.
-What?

1492
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:18,520
No, Parvati. How can you fire me?

1493
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:22,880
-I am 'The One Who Knows'
-You were, not are.

1494
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:25,400
-Read the letter.
-No...

1495
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:31,280
Hey!

1496
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:42,160
Taxi!

1497
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:49,760
Sir, I'm so happy to see you alive.

1498
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:51,760
Michael, why are you outside?

1499
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:54,400
Sir, some strange noises
were coming from the window.

1500
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:55,360
What?

1501
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,040
I got very scared.

1502
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:00,600
Michael, you should have shut the window.

1503
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:07,680
Oh, gosh!

1504
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,240
Sir, did you hear?

1505
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,480
To hell with the noise, Michael.

1506
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:24,880
Damn! Michael, how could you let
Maya go with Pandey?

1507
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:27,680
I don't know. Sir, I was damn scared.

1508
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:29,640
Sir, I suggest you change your fridge.

1509
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:32,120
-At my house also...
-Michael, you should go.

1510
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:34,600
Please, just go.

1511
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:38,360
Oh, shit. Karan.

1512
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:42,360
Sawant, what did you buy for your kids
this Diwali?

1513
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:45,320
There is so much the heart wants to buy,

1514
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:48,200
but there is a long distance
between the heart and the pocket.

1515
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:52,400
How I wish there was some
automatic way to make money.

1516
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:57,680
Money is not a taxi
that will come whenever you call.

1517
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:00,880
Hey. Who is this?

1518
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:04,160
Shit man! Why didn't I take Karan's call?

1519
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:14,840
Sir.

1520
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:17,520
Michael, please go. Just go home.

1521
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:21,120
Sir, Karan Johar had called.

1522
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:22,440
What? When?

1523
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:27,160
Sir, when you had gone out
and noises were coming from the fridge.

1524
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:29,080
Michael, what did he say?
What did Karan say?

1525
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:33,920
He said that was asking for you.
Sir, I'm telling you, this fridge...

1526
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:37,240
Michael, forget the fridge.
Focus. What did you say to Karan?

1527
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:44,000
I said that you were stuck at some point
in the story.

1528
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:46,520
Michael, let me tell you the problem
of my story. Listen.

1529
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:50,040
In my story, the hero has to choose
between two paths, one that is right

1530
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:53,920
-and one that is wrong.
-Sir, that's very easy.

1531
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:57,680
It seems easy, right?
But, my friend, if he chooses

1532
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:02,360
the right path, he is with his family,
and if he chooses the wrong path,

1533
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:07,560
he is with his true friends.
So, what's the decision,

1534
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:09,600
and what's the reason?

1535
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:12,120
Sir, he should choose the right path.

1536
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:16,160
But his friends helped him
when his family didn't.

1537
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:18,800
So then he must go with his friends.

1538
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:22,160
Michael, don't think too much
before answering.

1539
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,920
-I didn't think at all. sir.
-Yes, Michael.

1540
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:28,480
-Sir.
-Yes?

1541
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:30,880
-Sir, your problem is solved.
-What?

1542
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:33,440
-Sir, Rama had told me a story.
-What?

1543
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:36,040
-About Karan and Mahabharat.
-What?

1544
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:40,320
Sir, Karan decided to go with the villains
when his own family was not with him.

1545
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:44,920
Sir, that's the best example.
The best idea.

1546
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:46,880
The Best Idea. sir.

1547
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:50,520
Michael, you're a brilliant man!
What a theory, Michael.

1548
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:54,480
What a theory of the Mahabharat.
Amazing! I'm so stupid.

1549
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:56,800
I wasted two months trying to solve this.

1550
01:56:57,400 --> 01:57:01,400
Do this.
Whenever Karan calls, you tell him...

1551
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:07,360
Hello, Karan. To solve the here's problem,
we'll use the Mahabharat theory.

1552
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:12,400
Yes. Do you like it? No? Why?
Should I commit suicide?

1553
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:24,440
Some Mahabharat theory...
Hey, Michael! Pick up the phone.

1554
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:27,160
Sir, I also told him
about the Mahabharat story.

1555
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:28,400
What?

1556
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:29,600
That Mahabharat idea.

1557
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:31,640
No, Michael. Please.

1558
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:34,400
You are joking right?
Please Michael, you didn't say...

1559
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:36,640
-anything of that sort right?
-But you only told me...

1560
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:41,720
Michael, I was joking.
Come on, why did you say that?

1561
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:44,000
How can you be so stupid?

1562
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:45,640
Sir, you only told me to...

1563
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:49,440
Michael, I was joking. Joking.
Don't you understand jokes?

1564
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:52,640
Really? It was a joke. Something funny.

1565
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:57,920
Shit, I'm so stupid.
Why did I expect you to understand a joke?

1566
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:04,840
What a day! First, I lost Maya,
then the job, and now Karan...

1567
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:07,200
Why did you pick up the phone?
Why did you talk to Karan?

1568
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:09,880
Who asked you to talk rubbish to Karan?

1569
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:14,160
Sir, I never lie
and I clearly remember that you...

1570
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:19,800
Michael, will you just shut up?
Get out, fool! Get out!

1571
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:26,360
Get out of my house and never come back!
Idiot.

1572
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:32,400
Sir, I'm very sorry.
It's all because of me.

1573
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:35,440
-But when you were in the bathroom...
-Michael, I didn't mean it that way.

1574
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:38,240
Am I crazy enough to ask you to give

1575
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:43,680
your stupid ideas to Karan?
Do you have a brain inside your head?

1576
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:03,960
And if ever there is a stupid society,

1577
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:06,600
the people there will worship your idol.

1578
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:11,040
Now you can figure out why you
keep getting fired every two days,

1579
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:13,680
and why nobody loves you.

1580
01:59:24,120 --> 01:59:28,840
Sir, this is not true.
Rama loves me a lot.

1581
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:32,360
Then she is more stupid than you.

1582
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:36,520
Now get out before I do something bad.
Just get out.

1583
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:07,760
-Happy Diwali, dear!
-Happy Diwali!

1584
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:17,600
Sunny, why did you leave me and come home?

1585
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:34,840
They fired you?

1586
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:39,240
Yes.

1587
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:46,320
And I think I have lost Karan's film, too.

1588
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:51,320
Sunny. I'm sorry. How did this happen?

1589
02:00:53,640 --> 02:00:55,840
Sunny, there is no need to get so upset.
Okay?

1590
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:59,840
Anyway, I just don't like
'The One Who Knows' Sunny.

1591
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:03,760
I prefer my old Sunny.

1592
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:11,200
Yes, that's the thing.
Nobody liked my success.

1593
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,960
Why should you think differently?

1594
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:15,200
-Sunny, what are you saying?
-Forget it!

1595
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:18,160
Come on, we can start from here.
We'll figure something out.

1596
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:22,040
Whatever happens, happens for the best.
Trust me. Come on.

1597
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:24,920
Please. Just leave me alone for a while.
Please.

1598
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:27,360
How can I leave you alone
in this condition?

1599
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:31,880
You need to be with people, okay?
Come, the whole family is waiting for you.

1600
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,440
How many times do I have to say this,
Naani?

1601
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,600
Just leave me alone. I don't want to go.

1602
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:42,200
-Sunny...
-You live your life,

1603
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:45,000
so let me live mine.
Don't drag me into this family shit.

1604
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:48,880
-I'm fed up.
-Sunny...

1605
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:50,520
Did I ask you to celebrate Diwali?

1606
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:55,120
Since this marriage thing started,
it's suffocating me.

1607
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:02,880
Sunny, do you want to get married?

1608
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:14,440
I don't know.
I don't know anything, Naani.

1609
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:24,240
And now, I really don't know.

1610
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:33,040
Okay.

1611
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:59,720
Hi! Am I late?

1612
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:03,680
No. Sorry, Dad.
I completely forgot. Let's go.

1613
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:05,560
Sunny?

1614
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:10,040
Son, are you okay?

1615
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:15,720
I know you have lots
of complaints against me.

1616
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:23,240
They are all fair.
I haven't done much good in life.

1617
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:29,800
And I guess you are paying the price.

1618
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:33,800
The son is paying for the father's deeds.

1619
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,720
You are my good son, Sunny.

1620
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:45,600
And my whole life I never helped you.

1621
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:46,920
And now...

1622
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:53,600
There isn't much left in me.
Did you know that, son?

1623
02:03:54,680 --> 02:04:00,760
I always wanted one more child,
but your mother never agreed.

1624
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:07,040
She said, she wouldn't be able to love
the child like she loved you.

1625
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:13,720
And then it won't be fair.
At that time, I couldn't understand her.

1626
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:32,680
Wait.

1627
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:38,760
This is for you.

1628
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:43,160
Your mother had asked me
to give this at the right time.

1629
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:04,080
We would find all our destinations

1630
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:08,480
We would make no mistakes

1631
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:13,320
We would be together forever

1632
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:18,240
We would never let go of love

1633
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:21,920
Now that we have to be apart

1634
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:27,960
I wish we would share fewer dreams

1635
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:41,400
We would all have someone to lean on

1636
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:46,080
We would all have someone to love

1637
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:50,640
Every night would have a dawn

1638
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:54,800
The world would fill up with flowers

1639
02:05:55,480 --> 02:05:59,800
If only things could be that way

1640
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:04,480
If only there were no tears

1641
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:09,520
If only nobody had to lose

1642
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:14,520
Someone they would grow to love

1643
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:49,360
Thanks, Mom.

1644
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:53,840
But this isn't the right time.

1645
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:01,880
Everything has gone wrong.

1646
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:11,440
I wish I had a way to set
everything right again.

1647
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:18,680
I don't know what to do.

1648
02:07:21,880 --> 02:07:23,120
I can't understand what to do.

1649
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:26,760
How?

1650
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:48,640
God, can you give me one more chance?

1651
02:07:49,480 --> 02:07:53,800
Please. Just one last chance.

1652
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:01,240
I want to sort everything.
I want to correct everything.

1653
02:08:02,640 --> 02:08:06,000
Just one more chance. Please.

1654
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:30,760
Sunny! You are a very nice person.
Very nice, indeed.

1655
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:35,760
I have got the contract,
and the music company loved my song.

1656
02:08:36,240 --> 02:08:39,960
You encouraged me a lot,
that's why I could make it.

1657
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:46,240
You are a very, very nice person.
May God give you everything.

1658
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:51,000
Once again, thank you so much.

1659
02:08:54,120 --> 02:08:56,640
Let me thank Pandey, too. Thank you.

1660
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:28,400
-Hello.
-Hey Sunny, this is Karan.

1661
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:31,080
Karan? Karan, Hi!
I was trying to call you...

1662
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:33,200
I'm so sorry. My mobile phone died on me.

1663
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:34,800
Karan, I can explain everything.

1664
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:37,200
Okay. I have to leave for Chennai
for an urgent meeting.

1665
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:38,200
Oh, okay.

1666
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:41,400
Okay, here's why I called.
Your Mahabharat idea...

1667
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:42,880
-No...
-I liked it.

1668
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:45,720
What? You liked it?

1669
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:48,560
Yes. It's very nice, and allows for
an Indian sentiment.

1670
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:51,480
-I liked it...
-Yes, that's what I thought.

1671
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:52,600
Well done.

1672
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:55,400
No worries.
We'll discuss it when I get back.

1673
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:59,280
Yes. All right. You have a good Diwali.
All right. Okay.

1674
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:07,120
All right. Bye, Sunny. Hi, Honey.

1675
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:13,120
Yes! I'm back! Thank you, Mom!

1676
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:14,720
Thank you so much. I love you, Mom.

1677
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:16,920
Thank you, God. Thank you very much.

1678
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:18,640
I love you!

1679
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:21,480
Hey, Naani! Thank you, baby. I love...

1680
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:27,000
Hey, Naani. Hey. You were... I kept it...

1681
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:32,880
Who put this right here?

1682
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:41,680
Michael Burnett.

1683
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:49,760
Sir? You?

1684
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:52,760
Yes, I just...

1685
02:10:53,160 --> 02:10:55,200
What happened, sir? Is everything okay?

1686
02:10:56,160 --> 02:11:00,120
I just... Actually, I... What do you...

1687
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:01,240
A fan?

1688
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:04,560
No, not a fan. A film.

1689
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:09,520
Oh, Michael. I'm sorry, buddy.

1690
02:11:09,680 --> 02:11:14,200
Actually Karan Johar just called,
and he loved your Mahabharat idea.

1691
02:11:14,760 --> 02:11:17,560
So I thought,
I should come here and apologize.

1692
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:19,240
Thank God, sir.

1693
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:22,560
I was very worried that you
were in trouble because of me.

1694
02:11:22,680 --> 02:11:27,080
No, Michael. It was my mistake, my fault.

1695
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:30,440
Sir, how did you get my address?

1696
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:35,200
Actually, I ran into Mommy's Pizza
to look for you.

1697
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:39,280
They told me you live here,
so I ran to your place.

1698
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:44,120
Hey, Michael.
They told me you also got fired today.

1699
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:48,520
I couldn't even last for a day.
It's a new record.

1700
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:51,280
We're the same, right?

1701
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:56,000
So now what?

1702
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:02,520
As long as there are good people
like you in the world,

1703
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:04,280
I'll keep getting a job.

1704
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:08,080
You're a champion.

1705
02:12:09,960 --> 02:12:13,480
'Give from one hand, take from the other'

1706
02:12:13,560 --> 02:12:14,600
So you got it?

1707
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:20,520
Now that you have lost the job,
what about Rama?

1708
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:23,600
She prefers me inside
the house than outside.

1709
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:27,240
Fantastic! That's good.

1710
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:35,120
So, I'll leave now. Bye. God bless you.

1711
02:12:44,120 --> 02:12:45,320
-Happy Diwali.
-Happy Diwali.

1712
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:51,960
You do something about it.

1713
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:59,320
-Sir, sir!
-Yes, Michael?

1714
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:01,400
What happened to your Granny?

1715
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:11,680
Hey, Michael...

1716
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:21,080
I don't know why I spoke so much rubbish
about Rama unreasonably.

1717
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:22,640
-I'm very sorry.
-It's okay.

1718
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:27,120
No. It's my fault.
I just want to meet Rama once,

1719
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:31,520
and apologize to her,
or I won't be able to forgive myself.

1720
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:34,760
May I meet her?

1721
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:44,040
Michael, what about my shoes?

1722
02:13:44,120 --> 02:13:45,040
Come in. Don't mind it.

1723
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:57,440
Where's Rama?

1724
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:14,240
It has been 12 years, sir.

1725
02:15:02,360 --> 02:15:05,760
Mommy, there is no moon in Diwali.

1726
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:06,920
No.

1727
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:14,240
In Diwali, there is no moon,
no Santa Claus, and no Sunny.

1728
02:15:15,160 --> 02:15:16,440
I don't like Diwali.

1729
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:19,600
-Sir.
-Yes, Michael.

1730
02:15:20,680 --> 02:15:23,200
This is Naani's house.
Hey, where are you going?

1731
02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:26,560
Michael, not that Naani.

1732
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,120
Don't be such a kid.

1733
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:31,560
Come, Michael. Oh, don't be shy. Come on.

1734
02:15:32,680 --> 02:15:35,920
Okay, so here's the party.
Everybody, this is Michael.

1735
02:15:36,280 --> 02:15:38,440
Hey, John, how are you?
Uncle John, this is Michael.

1736
02:15:38,680 --> 02:15:41,920
Aunt Rosy, how are you?
This is Michael, and... Hello.

1737
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:45,240
I don't know who that is.
And this is my future Father-in-law.

1738
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:47,040
Wow, he's looking really good.

1739
02:15:47,120 --> 02:15:48,120
Michael.

1740
02:15:49,480 --> 02:15:52,560
And this is my Dad.
Dad, this is my friend, Michael.

1741
02:15:53,680 --> 02:15:55,760
-Happy Diwali, Dad.
-Happy Diwali, Son.

1742
02:15:56,080 --> 02:15:58,240
And that's Aunt Thelma.
Beware of her, she has a bad temper.

1743
02:15:58,320 --> 02:15:59,560
That's my sleeping Uncle...

1744
02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:03,720
And somewhere in this crowd
of sweet and crazy people is my...

1745
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:06,880
Naani.

1746
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:40,680
-Naani.
-Sunny, now what do you...

1747
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:43,200
Naani, please. I'm sorry.

1748
02:16:43,639 --> 02:16:45,440
-Sunny, I...
-I made a big mistake, Naani.

1749
02:16:45,639 --> 02:16:47,920
-I'm sorry.
-Yes, you made a mistake. Now...

1750
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:51,920
Naani, be quiet. Don't say anything.

1751
02:16:53,559 --> 02:16:55,040
You talk too much, anyway.

1752
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,400
-Now you want to get married?
-Yes.

1753
02:17:06,879 --> 02:17:09,040
You didn't even pause
before saying yes, why?

1754
02:17:09,559 --> 02:17:11,280
What do you mean why, Naani?
Give me your hand.

1755
02:17:11,360 --> 02:17:14,080
Why, Sunny? Why do you want
to get married? What's the reason?

1756
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:16,719
-Why didn't you pause?
-When I pause, there's a problem.

1757
02:17:16,799 --> 02:17:18,639
When I don't, there's a problem.
I really love you.

1758
02:17:18,719 --> 02:17:20,040
Now will you give me your hand?

1759
02:17:20,719 --> 02:17:22,559
You love Pandey, too. Marry him.

1760
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:27,160
Yuck. That's disgusting, Naani.
Have you ever seen Pandey in shorts?

1761
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:29,559
Sunny, what's the reason?

1762
02:17:38,120 --> 02:17:42,000
I don't know. No philosophy,
no advice, no bullshit.

1763
02:17:42,440 --> 02:17:44,400
I don't know,
and I don't even want to know.

1764
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:50,360
I'm just madly in love with my Naani,
and I want to get married to her.

1765
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:53,920
Now will you give your hand,
or will you punish me like this?

1766
02:18:00,360 --> 02:18:02,120
-I love you, baby.
-I love you.

1767
02:18:06,440 --> 02:18:09,120
Hey, Naani.
I forgot to introduce him to you.

1768
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:11,799
Hey, Michael. Come here.

1769
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:13,799
Come here, Michael.

1770
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:17,840
Naani, this is Michael.

1771
02:18:20,360 --> 02:18:22,080
And, Michael, that's my Rama.

1772
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:25,120
She's not just Naani anymore, but my wife.

1773
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:26,719
You are the home delivery person, right?

1774
02:18:26,799 --> 02:18:28,360
Yes, that's right.

1775
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:30,480
This is Mr. Home Delivery.

1776
02:18:31,320 --> 02:18:36,400
If anyone goes away
from home or is lost,

1777
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,480
he delivers them back to their home.

1778
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:41,280
Thank you.

1779
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:44,080

"Happy Diwali"

1823
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:03,400
Oh, it's you! You came so soon.
Thank God, we've been waiting for a month.

1824
02:22:04,920 --> 02:22:07,080
Hey, where are you going?

1825
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:09,080
-Do you want the work done?
-Yes, please, come in.

1826
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:11,400
-Where is it?
-It's inside the kitchen.

1827
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:13,400
I fell 40 times in the past month.

1828
02:22:13,480 --> 02:22:16,040
Go left. It's on the right of the counter.

1829
02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:16,960
A little forward.

1830
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:18,960
Yes. It's right there.
