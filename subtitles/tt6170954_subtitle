1
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,441
Yes, Sir.

2
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,420
I need a go-ahead now, Sir.

3
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,276
He's all alone.

4
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,316
No, I don't know how.

5
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,359
What's the point in apprehending him?

6
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,623
Where are we going to keep him?

7
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,632
Even the closest safe house
is 12 hours away.

8
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,067
Do we have a feed?
Just sound.

9
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:18,694
Patch it through.

10
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,197
In a moment.

11
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,427
Yes, Sir.

12
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,306
This is a rare opportunity, Sir.

13
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,536
Let's take him out, Sir.

14
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,306
Do you know that the value of
that cocaine is 5 million us dollars.

15
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,349
Thank you, Sir. Thank you.

16
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,445
Sir...
yeah...

17
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,515
Srini just sent this from Vienna.

18
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,392
It's confirmed... that's Mikhael.

19
00:04:58,698 --> 00:04:59,802
Okay!

20
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,371
- See you.
- Bye!

21
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,616
Freeze! Don't move.

22
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:09,955
Give me one...

23
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,492
Out to loot us all of you.

24
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:19,975
How about some snacks'?

25
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,173
Coach has ordered me not to.

26
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,370
You and your coach...

27
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,536
Can I eat?

28
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,980
The doctor's told you not to...

29
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:28,307
Sorry, ma'am.

30
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,619
No, not you.
Just a minute, mother.

31
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:31,986
Are you a ma'am?

32
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,715
Shabana, wait!
He said sorry!

33
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,575
Sorry, Mister.
So sorry.

34
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You...

35
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,571
What are you doing?
What are you doing, man?

36
00:08:58,738 --> 00:08:59,738
Let it be.

37
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,565
Mother, I've to attend
training after college today.

38
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,431
So I'll be late.

39
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,531
Bye.

40
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,643
Looking amazing, Shabana.
Shut up.

41
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,156
And therefore we can conclude...

42
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,222
That liabilities are all the money...

43
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,661
that a company
owes to outside parties.

44
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:56,295
From the bills,
it has to pay to its suppliers...

45
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:00,568
To the interest on the bonds that
the company has issued to creditors.

46
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,095
And of course, then there is...

47
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,264
Jai...

48
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,434
Jai...!

49
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,001
Yes, Sir.

50
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,795
Would you like a
pillow and blanket too?

51
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,505
No, Sir.

52
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,480
Good.

53
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,341
Then would you be so kind enough
to explain to the rest of the class...

54
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,356
what is the difference
between 'liability and 'asset.

55
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,283
Sir...

56
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,461
Sir, liabilities are...

57
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,432
Liabilities are...

58
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:30,790
Sir...

59
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,064
Sir, liabilities are...

60
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,102
Shhh... listen to him...

61
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,062
Yes...

62
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,606
Sir... Sir, I mean...

63
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:42,406
Assets are the most
important part of social...

64
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,209
Social? Please...
Don't tire yourself out.

65
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,243
If you don't mind,
may I try to explain?

66
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,580
Thank you.

67
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,350
Do you mind raising your hand? Go on.

68
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,062
Now students...

69
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,358
that's a liability.

70
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,373
That's quite enough,
you can put your hand down. Lower it.

71
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,533
Now may I request the rest of your
students to please raise your hands.

72
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,704
All of you.

73
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:17,774
Jai, my boy...

74
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,184
These are called assets.

75
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,111
Got it?

76
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:29,548
Sorry, Sir.

77
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,116
Guys...

78
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,758
I guess the 'liability? Will
be paying today's bill as well.

79
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,125
Stop it, you guys.

80
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,395
Sorry.
you're so stupid.

81
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:41,070
Why didn't you just say
one of those Santa-Santa jokes?

82
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:41,730
Simple.

83
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,128
Which one?

84
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,174
A drunk guy is a liability...

85
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,109
and a drunk girlfriend is an asset.

86
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:49,679
That's a good point.

87
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,148
Come, Priya,
we'll get late for our training.

88
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,415
Yes, guys.
Bye.

89
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,077
Okay bye.
Bye, Shabana.

90
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,415
<i>See you guys bye-</i>

91
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,079
bye, Shabana.

92
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,022
Guys-guys...

93
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,101
What's wrong?

94
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,674
Jai, you didn't run after her yet.

95
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:20,767
Are you feeling okay?

96
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,741
I don't know what to do with her?

97
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,017
I've been hitting on her forever.

98
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,513
But she never responds.

99
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,279
For the last one year,
I just pick her up and drop.

100
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,747
In fact, fuel prices dropped twice...

101
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,168
and was even raised once.

102
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,429
But I am still where I was.

103
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,163
I was an asset...

104
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,707
but now I am just a liability.

105
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,029
Jab cross.
Knee.

106
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,705
Go hard... Go hard.
Jab cross.

107
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:49,206
Kick.

108
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,333
Knee. Jab cross. Front. Front.

109
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,275
Jab cross. Hook.

110
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,136
Jab cross.
What are you doing?

111
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,771
Hook.
jab cross.

112
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,508
Hook.
jab cross.

113
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,548
Jab cross.

114
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,379
Jab cross.

115
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,348
Jab cross.

116
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:07,646
Upper-cut.

117
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,287
I want a gold tomorrow.

118
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,117
Sir.

119
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,219
Come on, jab cross.

120
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,754
Knee... kick.

121
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,629
Your driver's here.

122
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,170
Well... see you.
Bye.

123
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,293
Bye.

124
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,789
Tomorrow's my birthday.

125
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,115
Tomorrow's my tournament.

126
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,187
Your tournament isn't at night.

127
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,797
How about we go on
a date in the evening.

128
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,189
This birthday won't come back.

129
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,667
You're staring at me,
what does that mean?

130
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,260
Yes or no?

131
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,170
Hey driver, don't get any ideas.

132
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,068
I'll tell you tomorrow.

133
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:30,572
Shall I serve dinner?

134
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,140
Mother, it's Jai's birthday tomorrow.

135
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:38,414
So?

136
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:42,244
So he's inviting me on a date...
I mean dinner.

137
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,513
Do you want to?

138
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,450
It's delicious, mother.

139
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,391
I haven't thought about it.

140
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:59,531
Does he know you share
everything with me?

141
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,668
He doesn't know that you're
more of a friend than a mother.

142
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,103
My tournament's tomorrow, mother.

143
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,440
Don't forget to pray for me.

144
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,749
Come on!

145
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:30,225
Sujata! Sujata! Sujata!
Sujata! Sujata! Sujata!

146
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,481
Sujata! Sujata!

147
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,260
Yes.

148
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,737
[Speaking foreign language]

149
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,675
[Speaking foreign language]

150
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,150
In white corner, sujata Raina.

151
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,760
And in the blue corner, Shabana Khan.

152
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,665
Come on, Shabana. Come on!

153
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,028
Sujata! Sujata! Sujata!

154
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,429
Don't let her go.

155
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,659
Come on, Shabana. Come on.

156
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,001
Come on.
Yes.

157
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:22,961
Yes.

158
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,275
Yes, you've got this. Come on.
Come on.

159
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,152
Don't let her go.

160
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,487
How's the place?

161
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,251
It's beautiful.

162
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,689
The place belongs to my friend's dad.

163
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,563
Usually, it's closed on Mondays.

164
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,260
But it's open today... Only for you.

165
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:32,131
I've been planning to
bring you here to impress you.

166
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,132
Lam...

167
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,584
Happy birthday.

168
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,640
Wow!

169
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,586
Thanks, Shabana.

170
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,565
It's cheaper than
what you're wearing...

171
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,365
which indicates that you're
going through a bad time right now.

172
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,395
That's the problem...

173
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,301
you don't know
what I am going through.

174
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,098
I see...

175
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,240
What are you going through?

176
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:17,048
Right now everything
is at a standstill.

177
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:19,648
It's my best birthday ever.

178
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:25,494
Good... then have fun while it lasts.

179
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,024
Why so bitter?

180
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,138
What is your problem?

181
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,174
You know you're very lucky.

182
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,178
I see... why?

183
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:55,058
You strive really hard...
To hide your emotions...

184
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,388
to put up a strong front...

185
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,456
You can stop doing
that in front of me.

186
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,326
Because anyone else...

187
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,068
would've been frustrated
by now and run away.

188
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:13,133
Do you know how...
How much I tolerate you'?

189
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:19,315
You don't know the
value of this driver.

190
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,447
I don't... And yet I am sitting here.

191
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:29,252
Did you ever share anything
about you with me?

192
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,059
Maybe I am worried.

193
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,394
If I do, then maybe
my driver will run away.

194
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,760
Then you don't know
anything about your driver.

195
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,095
This happened five years ago.

196
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,100
Father was an alcoholic.

197
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,539
Typical wife and child beater.

198
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,168
After he got drunk...

199
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:25,307
he couldn't control
his tongue or his hands.

200
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,321
I grew up watching all this.

201
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,249
I would be amazed when...

202
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,518
I would go over
to my friend's place...

203
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,288
and see that it
doesn't happen with them.

204
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:47,269
Even the fathers love their children.

205
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:58,372
And the conditions in
my home were getting worse.

206
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,186
'That was a bad night.'

207
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:11,320
'he had a bad episode.'

208
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:15,026
'and mother was at the receiving end.'

209
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:18,068
for god's sake leave me!

210
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,007
Mother was crying out my name.

211
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:26,638
Shabana!

212
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,479
Shabana!

213
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,117
Shabana!

214
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:14,155
I don't know how
I... Hit him so hard...

215
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,186
He died.

216
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,166
My... my own father.

217
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,611
'I was sent to the
juvenile remand home.'

218
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:40,049
I stayed there for two years.'

219
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,022
you say that I don't share.

220
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:56,421
See...

221
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,093
I shared this.

222
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,599
Can I say something?

223
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:07,366
No, please don't.

224
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,602
I love you, Shabana.

225
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:17,316
Now you're taking
advantage of your birthday.

226
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,511
Why?

227
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,184
Will you believe
it if I say it tomorrow?

228
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,391
And why exactly do you love me?

229
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,399
I guess no boy has ever
said this to another girl.

230
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:36,662
But whenever I'm with you,
I feel really safe.

231
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,300
Even mother had a love-marriage.

232
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:48,610
Concentrate on your studies, driver.
Don't get into this hassle of love.

233
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,380
You've got it all wrong.

234
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,555
Your life's getting wasted...

235
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,715
mine is just started.

236
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,424
Because you're with me.

237
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,383
Shabana!

238
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:35,255
"The journey of my
hands... Towards yours..."

239
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:37,665
"Every day..."

240
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:40,101
"Every day..."

241
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:45,538
"Your eyes convey... Something
to mine..."

242
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:48,100
"Every day..."

243
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,247
"Every day..."

244
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:55,617
"Every day I think..."

245
00:27:55,674 --> 00:28:00,623
"where am I lost these days?"

246
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,283
"Every time I see you..."

247
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:11,348
"even my wounds start
smiling without a reason..."

248
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:18,633
"Sweep me away like the winds,
comforting me..."

249
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,068
"Every day..."

250
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,579
"Every day..."

251
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:29,279
"The journey of my
hands... Towards yours..."

252
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:31,754
"Every day..."

253
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:35,751
"Every day..."

254
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,652
I hope it's not too late.

255
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:41,422
Not at all.

256
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,194
Then... why don't we
go over to Shoats house.

257
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,165
His mom and dad are out of town.

258
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,293
His house must be empty.

259
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,002
Just drop me home.

260
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,198
I knew it.

261
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,023
I love you.
Huh?

262
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,525
What did you say?
Nothing.

263
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,192
What was that?
I didn't say anything.

264
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:41,739
"Tell me how long... Can
I keep looking at you."

265
00:29:54,493 --> 00:30:02,493
"Tell me how long can
I keep looking at you."

266
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:09,516
"It's always less..."

267
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:13,655
"no matter how long I look at you."

268
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:18,593
"Every day I think..."

269
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:23,690
"that I can live
with this feeling."

270
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:29,330
"If you keep meeting

271
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,465
"every day..."

272
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,169
"Every day..."

273
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:39,409
"The journey of my
hands... Towards yours..."

274
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,710
"Every day..."

275
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,583
"Every day..."

276
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:46,811
Look...

277
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
Hey...

278
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,126
Hello.

279
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,697
Madam...
our day's made.

280
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:59,201
She's running... wait-wait...

281
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:08,043
Wildcat.
hey, beautiful.

282
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,272
How about we give you a ride today'?
Friends.

283
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:17,181
Stop going around with
that good-for-nothing.

284
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:21,684
Just stop ahead.

285
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:23,534
Ignore them, they are drunk.

286
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,688
Full high voltage.

287
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,525
She's made me sober again.

288
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:32,156
Look...

289
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:37,333
Bye. See you.

290
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,136
Bye.

291
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,470
Uncouth.

292
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:45,071
What's the point of it now?
You should've said it on their face.

293
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,775
It's not about courage, Shabana.

294
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,619
One should know when to step in...

295
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,088
and when to back off.

296
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:12,563
Shabana.

297
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,797
Shabana, no.
Just a minute...

298
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,376
Shabana.
let her come...

299
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:18,542
She is coming.

300
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,639
Hi, beautiful.

301
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:23,712
Dammit.

302
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:26,577
You...

303
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,083
Shabana.

304
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:34,520
Come on.

305
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:38,522
Hold her.

306
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:41,592
Damn it.

307
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:44,666
Leave her!

308
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,599
Hold her.

309
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:50,213
Jai...
hold her down.

310
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,077
Jai, look back.

311
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:53,807
Jai, look back...

312
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,639
Shabana...

313
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:57,746
Jai...

314
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,257
Jai.

315
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,632
Jai.

316
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,104
Jai.
Shabana.

317
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:22,373
Jai.
Karen.

318
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,103
Jai.
Karen.

319
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:28,073
Jai, get up. Jai.

320
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,673
Jai...

321
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,279
Jai...

322
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:32,443
Karen.

323
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:33,488
Hold her.
Go.

324
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:34,580
Leave me.

325
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:36,653
Jai.
come on.

326
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,061
Let's go from here.

327
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,217
Leave me.

328
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,457
Jail

329
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,189
leave me!

330
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:46,424
Leave me!

331
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,292
Jai...

332
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,407
Forget her. Let's go.

333
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,397
Let's go.

334
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:04,454
Jai... Jai...

335
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,521
Jai... Jai... Get up.
Don't do this to me.

336
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,251
Jai... get up.

337
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,189
Help!

338
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:11,317
Help!

339
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,587
Get up. Get up.

340
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:15,029
Jai... Jai...

341
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,756
Jai... Jai...

342
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:20,270
Jai... get up... get up.

343
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,227
Get up.

344
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,302
Jai, please... help!

345
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:27,600
Help!

346
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,210
Anyone, please help.

347
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,173
Please help!

348
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,712
Help. Jai...

349
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,186
I am sorry... please take care.

350
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,661
Wait... wait...

351
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:53,392
Shabana.

352
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:54,692
Please... Shabana.

353
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,128
Please... Shabana.

354
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,221
Wait.

355
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:51,279
I am sorry...

356
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,329
I am sorry...

357
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,487
Shabana.

358
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:40,486
Shabana, no.

359
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,591
No!

360
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,770
'But whenever I'm with you,
I feel really safe.'

361
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:52,394
Shabana!

362
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:58,629
Kick.

363
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,338
Get it down.
Get it down.

364
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:02,307
Grab. Grab.

365
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,040
Submission. Go.

366
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,716
You don't even remember
the number plate.

367
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,290
Even the description is quite vague.

368
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,250
This will take time.

369
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:18,124
But, Sir, it's been three months.

370
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:20,162
At least now... please.

371
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,464
These things take time... they do...

372
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:28,129
You know what...

373
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:29,701
Tomorrow... no.

374
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:30,670
Come back day after tomorrow.

375
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,274
I'll do something.

376
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,031
Now go.

377
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:35,566
Go.

378
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:39,679
Sir, at least do some work.

379
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,343
You shouldn't stop working completely.

380
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:46,451
What did she say? Say that again?

381
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,055
Nothing, Sir...

382
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:50,248
Say it...
Nothing, Sir. We'll leave.

383
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,055
Say it again.

384
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:52,389
Come, Shabana. Let's go.

385
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,331
Your attitude is what killed that boy.

386
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,497
Shabana...
I know all about it.

387
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,466
Someone's always dying around you.

388
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:01,662
Shabana, let's go.

389
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,529
Shabana, let's go.
Let's go.

390
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:07,041
And yes... No need to come
back day after tomorrow either.

391
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,309
Come back next week...
When your mind cools down.

392
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:13,547
What were you blabbering
in there, Shabana?

393
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,141
You should stay calm.

394
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:16,273
Hello.

395
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:17,741
Hello, Shabana.

396
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:22,380
Who is this?

397
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,721
Need you to be alone.
Get rid of Priya.

398
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,427
I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

399
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,494
Who's this?

400
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:39,440
It was a military green Jeep.

401
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:43,444
Go to Irani Café and wait for my call.

402
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:47,372
Who was that?

403
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,047
Shabana... who was that on the phone?

404
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,152
Priya, you go...

405
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,722
I need to buy something for mother.

406
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:55,382
But who was on the phone?

407
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,580
Let's meet tomorrow.

408
00:41:57,315 --> 00:41:58,555
Are you sure?
Yeah.

409
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,392
Okay, fine. Take care.

410
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,318
Can I get you something, ma'am?

411
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:02,446
Pepsi.
okay.

412
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:31,079
Hello.

413
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:32,277
Hello, Shabana.

414
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:34,151
Hi.

415
00:43:34,412 --> 00:43:35,789
I have a proposal for you.

416
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:38,582
Who is this?

417
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,223
Well, you can say that I am
speaking from one of the agencies.

418
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:42,623
What agency?

419
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,327
That's the end of your
questions now it's my turn.

420
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:47,403
I need some answers, can I start?

421
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:53,204
Do you want to know
who those four were?

422
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,634
Yes.

423
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,490
What will you do if you find out?

424
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,242
I want justice for Jai.

425
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,308
How?

426
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:08,555
I want to kill them!

427
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:13,056
Can you repeat that for me?

428
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:19,325
I want to kill those murderers!

429
00:44:19,524 --> 00:44:21,265
Nice to hear that.

430
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:24,461
You know what...

431
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:28,243
I started giving
up on your generation.

432
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,807
You know I thought these
tablets and smart-phones...

433
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:35,084
was depleting your sensitivity.

434
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:38,054
It's nice to hear someone
talking about revenge...

435
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:39,452
in the voice of pain.

436
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:42,718
Tell me something...

437
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,490
You don't want them
to be booked by the law?

438
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,291
I don't trust the law anymore.

439
00:44:49,587 --> 00:44:51,396
Why don't you trust the law anymore?

440
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:54,494
It's been three months... Yet no clue.

441
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:56,468
Can't be incompetence, right?

442
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:57,761
You're right.

443
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:01,342
It took me only an hour
to get that Jeep's license plate.

444
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,140
There's a coffee shop, four shops
and six buildings oh that road...

445
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:09,413
and their CCTV cameras cover
the road where Jai was murdered.

446
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:11,747
So it can't be incompetence.

447
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,481
It's an effort to save those four.

448
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:21,195
So my final question
and proposal to you, Shabana.

449
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,097
You'll get the information you want.

450
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,365
As well as all the help you need.

451
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:30,765
But after you're done
tying up your personal agenda...

452
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:33,574
you must do something
for us... our agency.

453
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:40,615
Let me tell you... Our
agency knows no limits.

454
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,543
Those who work for us...

455
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,519
go beyond all limits
to do their duty.

456
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:51,650
So Shabana...

457
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:58,100
I'll call you back tonight
at exactly 1 am.

458
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:02,131
Your answer will decide our next step.

459
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,541
Think carefully, Shabana.

460
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:11,169
As Jai said...

461
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:14,474
you should know when to step in...

462
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,682
and when to back off.

463
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:19,309
Bye.

464
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,484
Yes...

465
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:03,386
Good.

466
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,390
Tomorrow at 2 pm,
be at the same Irani café...

467
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,730
where you were today.

468
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:10,028
Carry a Cadbury 5 Star...

469
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:12,074
and Bluetooth earpiece with you.

470
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,970
Okay. Bye.

471
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:15,298
Hello.

472
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:16,366
Hello...

473
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,012
Can I ask you something?

474
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:25,275
Ask...

475
00:47:26,544 --> 00:47:29,650
You guys have been
keeping a watch on me...

476
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:31,617
Following me around...

477
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:37,359
Could you have... Saved Jai from dying?

478
00:47:43,628 --> 00:47:44,663
Technically...

479
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:49,165
Yes!

480
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,240
And no!

481
00:47:57,008 --> 00:47:58,419
You were not one of us then...

482
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:02,719
If you had been... We
would've stopped them.

483
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:08,120
We really look after our own, Shabana.

484
00:48:08,486 --> 00:48:11,490
But in your case,
all we could do was...

485
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:14,626
we sent the police and
ambulance before you could call.

486
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,707
What else do you know?

487
00:48:21,165 --> 00:48:23,441
We know everything about you, Shabana.

488
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:26,002
Everything!

489
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,749
Your mother. Your father... sorry...

490
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,644
You don't like talking
about him, right?

491
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:37,621
We've your entire life on a pen-drive.

492
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:42,987
But it's not a blackmail
or a threat call.

493
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,294
It's a deal.

494
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,163
We'll only proceed if you agree.

495
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:55,101
Do we have a deal, Shabana?

496
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:01,371
Yes...

497
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:05,213
Welcome to the agency, Shabana Khan.

498
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,030
Chocolate.

499
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:29,199
Thank you.

500
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,034
Hello...

501
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,670
All the four of them are from Delhi.

502
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,568
And currently,
they are hiding in Goa...

503
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,736
which is a good thing for us.

504
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,480
Put everything back
inside and start walking.

505
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:29,204
I need you to take a small test.

506
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,471
To understand how prepared you are...

507
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,668
and what kind of help
you're going to need.

508
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:35,768
Just follow my instructions.

509
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:40,896
On your right, there's a man coming
towards you with a brown packet...

510
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:42,516
It has a loaded syringe.

511
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,040
Take it.

512
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,386
Don't worry we only need
to make someone unconscious.

513
00:50:54,819 --> 00:50:56,457
Keep walking straight.

514
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:03,068
This test involves a lab rat...

515
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,032
who is going to die today.

516
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:07,202
Exactly 150 meters ahead of you.

517
00:51:12,136 --> 00:51:14,082
He's one of our informers, Imran.

518
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:15,748
His life is in danger.

519
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,543
Someone's leaked information
that he works for us.

520
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:20,382
And he's going to be murdered today.

521
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,229
His assailant is exactly behind him.

522
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:29,489
You must save Imran's life.

523
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:34,059
Take a good look at the streets
and lanes around you, Shabana.

524
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:48,577
Now move.

525
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:57,616
It's too crowded. Turn left.

526
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:02,262
There's an entrance on your left.

527
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:03,521
Take the stairs.

528
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:04,995
We'll use the roof.

529
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:11,172
Be fast... You don't have much time.

530
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:50,408
Yellow t-shirt... all yours.

531
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:12,753
You're good, Shabana.

532
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,391
Were you scared?
No.

533
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:17,690
Really?

534
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:19,842
You wouldn't have let
anything happen to me.

535
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,561
You said the agency
really looks after it's own.

536
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,302
The man approaching from
the front will hand you a packet.

537
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:31,411
It contains cash, phone,
ticket and hotel booking details.

538
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,409
You must leave for
Goa tomorrow morning.

539
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,141
I'll call you back.

540
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:38,708
Good luck.

541
00:54:50,087 --> 00:54:52,260
What's this tournament now?

542
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,501
It's a private tournament, mom.

543
00:54:55,693 --> 00:54:57,366
It's only a matter of three days.

544
00:54:57,728 --> 00:54:59,730
What about accommodations,
food <i>et cetera</i>?

545
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:02,974
It's an invitation, mother.

546
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:04,971
Why are you so worried?

547
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:07,409
Because you're not
looking me in the eye.

548
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,316
Do you trust me?
Not that nonsense.

549
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:19,659
Is everything okay, Shabana?

550
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:33,765
Mother, if you ever feel I am lying...

551
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:37,206
then please stop asking
any more questions.

552
00:55:39,203 --> 00:55:42,241
Just have faith that I
am not doing anything stupid.

553
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:47,213
I always share everything with you.

554
00:55:49,213 --> 00:55:51,284
You've always done what you wished.

555
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:00,124
You know, mother...

556
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,701
I couldn't tell Jai that...

557
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:21,422
All of them are
staying at golden sand.

558
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:23,182
They have a set routine.

559
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:25,151
Partying from dawn to dusk.

560
00:56:26,016 --> 00:56:28,018
Their ring-leader Karen...

561
00:56:28,285 --> 00:56:30,629
he's the spoiled brat
of a spoiled brat father.

562
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:43,134
The other three are his sycophants.

563
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:46,447
They stay holed up at the
shack on Anjana Beach, the whole day.

564
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,250
Disco and booze at night.

565
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:50,745
They like Russians.

566
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,620
They go to club 10.

567
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:57,581
You have 48 hours.
I will call you back tomorrow.

568
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,728
The plan will be all yours,
I'm just helping.

569
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,666
"First you torment us..."

570
00:57:40,724 --> 00:57:42,533
"and then you charm us."

571
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:46,768
"We don't know this attitude,
sweetheart."

572
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,545
"First you torment us..."

573
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:57,346
"and then you charm us."

574
00:57:57,541 --> 00:58:01,318
"We don't know this attitude,
sweetheart."

575
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:05,018
"We've been waiting
for so long... Baby."

576
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:08,529
"We're ready to surrender completely,
sweetheart."

577
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:16,527
"We love to party more than life."

578
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:21,238
"O heart sing along..."

579
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:24,677
"Sing this song when you're high."

580
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:28,642
"O heart sing along..."

581
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:32,381
"Sing this song when you're high."

582
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:50,765
"O heart sing along..."

583
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:54,708
"Sing this song when you're high."

584
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:58,146
"O heart sing along..."

585
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:02,275
"Sing this song when you're high."

586
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:28,633
"O heart sing along..."

587
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:32,271
"Sing this song when you're high."

588
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,553
"O heart sing along..."

589
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:43,989
Come on...

590
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,437
Let's go to the room.

591
01:00:01,732 --> 01:00:04,042
"O heart sing along..."
Bye.

592
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:05,770
Bye.
goodnight, Karen. Goodnight.

593
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:09,081
You want to have fun.

594
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:36,567
Hello.

595
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:38,376
What have you decided?

596
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:40,612
Sir, I am only going to kill Karen.

597
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:42,582
I want the others
to live and die in fear...

598
01:00:42,606 --> 01:00:44,347
for the rest of their lives.

599
01:00:44,675 --> 01:00:46,484
Just like me, in guilt.

600
01:00:47,244 --> 01:00:49,451
I'll go to their hotel tonight,
and wait.

601
01:00:50,681 --> 01:00:53,218
I will kill Karen in his
room after the girl leaves.

602
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:58,163
Sir, but hotel means
CCTV cameras and all.

603
01:00:58,255 --> 01:01:00,064
Don't worry, we'll handle it.

604
01:01:00,724 --> 01:01:01,724
Sir...

605
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,130
Do you need something?

606
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:05,995
Nothing, Sir.

607
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:07,663
I'll manage.

608
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:09,766
All the best.

609
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:12,203
You only have tonight.

610
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:14,370
Sir.

611
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:19,681
Sir... is there someone out here,
to help me?

612
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:22,745
There is.

613
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:27,085
Was he at the bar yesterday?

614
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,225
We've sent one of our best, Shabana.

615
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,160
You're special for us.

616
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,196
And this is important for you...

617
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:36,601
that's why we're indulging.

618
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,070
Actually,
this doesn't concern us at all.

619
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,403
You're made for something else.

620
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,034
All the best.

621
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:24,281
I know...

622
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:25,408
Dude...

623
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:28,081
Listen you. You have to try.
He's becoming a bit mad.

624
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,451
How can you be so sure'?

625
01:02:29,513 --> 01:02:30,583
The party was fun.

626
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:32,217
Whoever try.

627
01:02:32,316 --> 01:02:34,227
That's amazing.

628
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:12,349
Who is it?

629
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:35,337
What the...

630
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:32,084
Karan!

631
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:33,549
Karan!

632
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,592
You think he'll wake up.

633
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:40,466
He was quite busy last night...
Karan...

634
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:41,628
He will.

635
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,067
Open up.
Ring it again.

636
01:07:43,193 --> 01:07:44,103
Come on...

637
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,299
Karen.
Karen.

638
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:48,732
Karen.

639
01:08:14,357 --> 01:08:15,427
Karen.
Karen.

640
01:08:15,525 --> 01:08:17,402
I guess he got really high last night.

641
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:18,731
He isn't sober yet.

642
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:20,028
Karen.

643
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:42,718
Who are you?

644
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:45,658
Let's call the housekeeping guy.

645
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:47,065
Housekeeping.

646
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,360
Come here.
Come on...

647
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:49,391
What happened?

648
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:50,459
Come on...

649
01:08:50,727 --> 01:08:51,727
Karen.

650
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:53,261
Open this door.

651
01:08:53,997 --> 01:08:55,477
That's not my job, it's the managers.

652
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:11,346
You okay?

653
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,494
No manager will..
Open up...

654
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:19,065
Open up...
I am manager, we're the boss.

655
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:21,957
Karen.

656
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:24,259
Karen.

657
01:09:25,095 --> 01:09:26,095
Karan!

658
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:29,264
Karan!

659
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:30,365
Karan!

660
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:25,257
Hello.

661
01:10:25,455 --> 01:10:27,025
Don't waste time, Shabana.

662
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:29,500
Get to the airport
and catch your flight.

663
01:10:30,627 --> 01:10:31,697
Shabana...

664
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:34,535
you did very well.

665
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:37,438
I'll call you back.

666
01:10:38,468 --> 01:10:40,175
But from now on... It'll be only for us.

667
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:42,471
Bye.

668
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,139
There you are Shabana.

669
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:17,146
I've been looking all over for you.
Come...

670
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:20,244
Yeah... I was just leaving.

671
01:11:20,343 --> 01:11:22,143
Let's at least walk
together till the canteen.

672
01:11:22,245 --> 01:11:24,486
No... maybe some other time.
Shabana...

673
01:11:25,348 --> 01:11:28,727
What is this? And for how long?

674
01:11:29,419 --> 01:11:31,228
We all are hurt!

675
01:11:31,721 --> 01:11:33,667
But we have to move on, right?

676
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,394
That's what I am doing.

677
01:11:35,725 --> 01:11:36,726
Moving on.

678
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:39,227
See you.

679
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,043
Hello.

680
01:11:51,274 --> 01:11:52,274
Hello, Shabana.

681
01:11:53,243 --> 01:11:54,722
Are you rested?
Yes.

682
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:57,286
Time for us to meet.

683
01:11:58,281 --> 01:12:00,659
I'm texting you the address and time.

684
01:12:01,718 --> 01:12:02,458
See you.

685
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:03,719
Okay, Sir.

686
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:40,048
Hello, Shabana.

687
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,417
Hi, Sir.

688
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:45,053
For you.

689
01:13:51,094 --> 01:13:52,368
One must be prepared.

690
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:56,066
In our profession,
one must always be prepared.

691
01:13:57,734 --> 01:13:59,111
It's actually very simple.

692
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:01,176
National defense has two aspects.

693
01:14:01,337 --> 01:14:03,317
One, which is visible to all.

694
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:05,450
Army-Navy-air force...

695
01:14:06,209 --> 01:14:08,246
Which are legit,
recognized institutions.

696
01:14:08,411 --> 01:14:10,015
Their work is appreciated.

697
01:14:10,213 --> 01:14:12,318
Acknowledged.
felicitated.

698
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:15,723
They have a uniform,
a designation, respect.

699
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:17,596
They are the pride of the nation.

700
01:14:19,322 --> 01:14:21,199
And the other one... Is us.

701
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,199
We work in anonymity.

702
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,373
No uniform, no designation...

703
01:14:27,997 --> 01:14:29,499
The only silver lining is that...

704
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:31,578
we do is even beyond
their comprehension.

705
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:34,173
Life is bad...

706
01:14:35,238 --> 01:14:36,444
And death is worse.

707
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,309
Our agency has only one agenda.

708
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:42,484
National security...

709
01:14:43,546 --> 01:14:45,082
At any cost.

710
01:14:46,549 --> 01:14:49,291
Shabana, you'll be prepared
for every possible situation.

711
01:14:50,086 --> 01:14:51,793
And we'll use you when the time comes.

712
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:53,759
In India as well as abroad.

713
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,270
You will have a life...
Which will be fake.

714
01:14:56,726 --> 01:14:58,637
And you can do anything you like.

715
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:01,400
But when we need you,
you'll work for us.

716
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:04,033
But why me, Sir.

717
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,140
Females are born with
an extra strand in their DNA.

718
01:15:08,304 --> 01:15:10,215
Men need gadgets.

719
01:15:11,407 --> 01:15:13,011
Women are already pre-configured.

720
01:15:13,309 --> 01:15:14,515
They are born spies.

721
01:15:15,411 --> 01:15:19,484
Plus your talent, your aptitude,
makes you unique, Shabana.

722
01:15:21,217 --> 01:15:22,753
But what if I can't do it, Sir?

723
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:27,593
At any given time, we are tracking
more than 15,000 candidates.

724
01:15:28,558 --> 01:15:31,038
And only pick four... Every year.

725
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,068
We've been tracking you since
the days of your arrest and remand.

726
01:15:50,113 --> 01:15:53,458
You were not ready last year,
but this year you are.

727
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:56,289
We want you to be a field agent.

728
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:02,101
Because of my religion.

729
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,967
That's a perk for us.

730
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:09,274
And it's a good thing that
you have a view about your religion...

731
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:12,245
which is different from any
typical Hindu or Muslim politician.

732
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:14,614
And thank god for that.

733
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:17,113
Of course, that's an advantage.

734
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,575
Owing to the current situation,
Shabana...

735
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:23,088
your religion gives us extra access.

736
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:25,618
Opens many doors for us.

737
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:34,094
I always wanted to represent
India in sports at the highest level.

738
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:37,194
I know... How you want
to waste your talent.

739
01:16:39,629 --> 01:16:43,475
Shabana, those who know their
motive in life are the lucky ones.

740
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,076
Because the entire world
is running after fame and fortune.

741
01:16:47,637 --> 01:16:50,584
But how many do you know would
like to choose a glorious death'?

742
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:57,647
One of us dies... To protect millions.

743
01:16:58,748 --> 01:17:00,728
You would wonder
whether it's worth it.

744
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,125
So Shabana, this is your last chance.

745
01:17:05,588 --> 01:17:07,363
It's your life, your call.

746
01:17:08,591 --> 01:17:11,401
Tomorrow at 11 am, you'll
receive a call from a cable-guy.

747
01:17:11,461 --> 01:17:12,997
Your handler.

748
01:17:13,596 --> 01:17:15,576
Whatever your answer, just tell him.

749
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:18,000
Cable-GT?

750
01:17:18,534 --> 01:17:20,070
See you, goodnight.

751
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:21,470
Goodnight.

752
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:46,506
Keep a strict watch on her.

753
01:17:48,064 --> 01:17:49,744
If you see anything suspicious,
finish her.

754
01:17:50,566 --> 01:17:51,566
Where's the taxi?

755
01:18:08,317 --> 01:18:09,557
Where do you want to go, madam?

756
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,066
Take me home, Mister.

757
01:18:39,015 --> 01:18:40,551
Mother.
yes.

758
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:42,656
How long has the
cable not been working?

759
01:18:43,019 --> 01:18:44,498
Not working?

760
01:18:45,254 --> 01:18:46,995
It was fine last night.

761
01:18:52,128 --> 01:18:53,128
Hello.

762
01:18:53,162 --> 01:18:54,163
Hello, madam.

763
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,201
I am speaking from Preetam Cable.

764
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:58,033
Yes.

765
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:01,173
Do you want the new scheme?

766
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:06,374
Yes...

767
01:19:06,642 --> 01:19:09,248
Fine, meet me at 2 pm
along with a photo ID.

768
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:12,323
I'm texting you the address.
Thank you.

769
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:15,126
At least turn on the cable now.

770
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:18,086
Okay, madam.

771
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:36,201
Travel agent...

772
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:43,338
Cable-guy, courier guy, your
accountant... Your driver... Your maid...

773
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:47,079
They all know a lot about your life.

774
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:50,148
That's why if I want
to get in someone's home...

775
01:21:50,373 --> 01:21:52,046
I offer them a broadband connection.

776
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:53,454
If they want it, it's good.

777
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:56,080
Otherwise, I give them a free offer.

778
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:57,717
Three months free...

779
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,450
100 GB free.

780
01:21:59,749 --> 01:22:00,784
Everything free.

781
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:05,225
And the people just love
hearing the word 'free'.

782
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:06,287
Come...

783
01:22:36,385 --> 01:22:38,092
Where are you taking me?

784
01:22:38,721 --> 01:22:39,721
School.

785
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:52,736
In here, I am your benefactor.

786
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:00,653
Sir said that you're swift.

787
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:03,390
But I want to see how swift.

788
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,491
Didn't Sir tell you that
all this isn't required anymore?

789
01:23:06,515 --> 01:23:07,515
He did...

790
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:11,197
But I requested him to see for myself.

791
01:23:12,121 --> 01:23:13,121
I am waiting outside.

792
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,434
You have only 3 minutes.

793
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:18,195
If you come back in 3 minutes,
then very good.

794
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:20,368
If you don't, then very bad.

795
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:22,096
Best of luck.

796
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:24,701
Boys...

797
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,044
don't embarrass me.

798
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:36,147
Amazing... wow!

799
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:38,548
Bloody morons.

800
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:39,780
That's not true, Shabana.

801
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:44,287
We could be anything but morons.

802
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:51,163
From now onwards you
will address me as Sir.

803
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:57,060
This is your lesson no. 1
staring at your face... Right now!

804
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,501
Never ever take
anything at face value.

805
01:25:02,364 --> 01:25:05,004
I've been given the responsibility
of training you in a month.

806
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:07,641
That's your room.

807
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:09,505
That's where you'll stay.

808
01:25:10,039 --> 01:25:11,541
You can go home on Sundays.

809
01:25:13,042 --> 01:25:15,044
We have your bank account details.

810
01:25:15,177 --> 01:25:16,737
The money will be
deposited every month.

811
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:19,653
We don't give any appointment letters.

812
01:25:20,549 --> 01:25:21,549
Go home...

813
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:23,555
Lie to your mother...

814
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:26,063
and start packing.

815
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:28,456
Dismiss.

816
01:25:59,621 --> 01:26:07,621
"The water... In the eyes..."

817
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:17,665
"cannot drown the dreams."

818
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:28,008
"The wind... Or the storm..."

819
01:26:30,052 --> 01:26:38,052
"cannot break the stars."

820
01:26:40,062 --> 01:26:43,669
"The wounds of the heart..."

821
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,613
"only makes you strong."

822
01:26:50,272 --> 01:26:53,082
"There's a story.

823
01:26:53,175 --> 01:26:57,624
"Which time wants to convey."

824
01:26:57,746 --> 01:27:02,525
"Lam still alive..."

825
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:07,431
"I am still here..."

826
01:27:07,489 --> 01:27:13,235
"There's a ray of light..."

827
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:17,635
"in this pile of ashes."

828
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:21,013
"Lam still alive..."

829
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:26,578
"I am still here..."

830
01:27:27,676 --> 01:27:35,676
"There's some life... Still left in me."

831
01:27:48,697 --> 01:27:51,678
Mother... it happens during practice.

832
01:27:59,675 --> 01:28:03,418
"My feet haven't forgotten..."

833
01:28:04,179 --> 01:28:09,652
"how to tread down
impossible trails."

834
01:28:09,718 --> 01:28:13,689
"So what if I was defeated
a number of times..."

835
01:28:14,256 --> 01:28:19,968
Haven't forgotten how to fight."

836
01:28:20,062 --> 01:28:23,441
"My feet haven't forgotten..."

837
01:28:24,366 --> 01:28:30,112
"to tread down impossible trails."

838
01:28:30,172 --> 01:28:34,052
"So what if I was defeated
a number of times..."

839
01:28:34,543 --> 01:28:40,186
Haven't forgotten how to fight."

840
01:28:40,282 --> 01:28:44,230
"Even today my heart's a rebel..."

841
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:48,699
"that's all I need."

842
01:28:49,124 --> 01:28:53,664
"Lam still alive..."

843
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:58,535
"I am still here..."

844
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:04,548
"There's a ray of light..."

845
01:29:04,706 --> 01:29:08,984
"in this pile of ashes."

846
01:29:09,311 --> 01:29:13,657
"Lam still alive..."

847
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:17,686
"I am still here..."

848
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:27,087
"There's some life... Still left in me."

849
01:29:29,331 --> 01:29:33,336
"Lam still alive..."

850
01:29:34,403 --> 01:29:38,510
"Lam still alive..."

851
01:31:13,235 --> 01:31:15,010
Hello Sir. Tony has arrived.

852
01:31:15,337 --> 01:31:16,547
When did he arrive in Malaysia?

853
01:31:16,571 --> 01:31:17,606
This morning, Sir.

854
01:31:18,407 --> 01:31:20,182
Team Alpha got tipped
off from the airport.

855
01:31:20,242 --> 01:31:21,585
It's three nights stay.

856
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:23,179
We even checked with the airlines.

857
01:31:23,245 --> 01:31:25,054
He's flying back
to Dubai on Wednesday.

858
01:31:25,113 --> 01:31:26,319
It's a confirmed Intel, Sir.

859
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:28,594
So we've three nights.

860
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:30,286
Put him on surveillance.

861
01:31:30,352 --> 01:31:31,592
Find out his pattern.

862
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:33,463
We'll take him out on the last day.

863
01:31:33,622 --> 01:31:34,622
Sir.

864
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:36,228
I am arranging the backup.

865
01:31:36,325 --> 01:31:37,325
Sir.

866
01:31:53,742 --> 01:31:56,416
Bloody glutton's been
eating for two hours.

867
01:31:57,079 --> 01:31:58,683
And I can't even...

868
01:31:59,181 --> 01:32:01,320
Yeah, he should be
concerned about us, right?

869
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:02,416
Shut up.

870
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:19,770
He's coming...
He's coming out.

871
01:32:36,084 --> 01:32:37,256
He's going alone.

872
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:00,240
Sir...

873
01:33:00,542 --> 01:33:02,249
He's left alone
without his security.

874
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:03,345
He's driving himself.

875
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:04,622
Do we have a visual?
Negative, Sir.

876
01:33:04,646 --> 01:33:06,387
We're tailing him.
Keep me posted.

877
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:07,581
Sir.

878
01:33:09,651 --> 01:33:12,723
Sir... at least tell
me what's the story?

879
01:33:13,355 --> 01:33:14,993
Who is this Tony?

880
01:33:15,056 --> 01:33:16,660
I'll get distracted...

881
01:33:16,725 --> 01:33:20,229
and also know who is
putting pressure on my kidney.

882
01:33:20,295 --> 01:33:22,468
Two people are putting
pressure on your kidney.

883
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:25,136
This is Mikhael... A.K.A. Prince.

884
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:26,337
Arms dealer.

885
01:33:26,501 --> 01:33:28,344
Jaish M. Lashkar.

886
01:33:28,536 --> 01:33:30,607
The one-stop shop for
everyone's arms requirement.

887
01:33:30,705 --> 01:33:32,742
We've been trying to
catch him for 10 years now.

888
01:33:33,041 --> 01:33:34,679
Raw... Interpol... ISI...

889
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:37,383
This is the only picture they have.

890
01:33:37,512 --> 01:33:38,718
And it's two years old.

891
01:33:39,047 --> 01:33:42,119
Hard to spot... nor a voice sample.
No fingerprint.

892
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:43,617
He's a ghost.

893
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:47,393
1 1/2 years ago we finally
tracked him down.

894
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:54,734
Two of our men died... And
he barely managed to escape.

895
01:33:57,799 --> 01:33:58,959
After that, he disappeared...

896
01:33:59,234 --> 01:34:00,235
Completely off the grid.

897
01:34:01,236 --> 01:34:02,340
And this is Tony.

898
01:34:03,438 --> 01:34:05,611
The means to catch that big fish.

899
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:07,041
Small fish.

900
01:34:07,509 --> 01:34:08,681
He deals in flesh trade.

901
01:34:09,177 --> 01:34:10,247
Women trafficking.

902
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:12,583
It's believed that he
has the blessings of Mikhael.

903
01:34:13,281 --> 01:34:16,160
He's been quite active in south-east
Asia for the past few months.

904
01:34:16,584 --> 01:34:19,463
In fact,
same customers, same interest.

905
01:34:19,988 --> 01:34:22,093
If anyone's seen Mikhael recently...

906
01:34:22,424 --> 01:34:23,562
then that's Tony.

907
01:34:25,026 --> 01:34:26,027
So Gupta...

908
01:34:26,728 --> 01:34:28,401
to cut the long story short.

909
01:34:29,097 --> 01:34:32,738
If we can get to Mikhael through Tony,
and eliminate him.

910
01:34:33,335 --> 01:34:35,178
Then this will be
the biggest operation...

911
01:34:35,437 --> 01:34:38,748
in the last 10 years amongst
all the world's agencies.

912
01:35:34,262 --> 01:35:36,242
Maria. Maria.

913
01:35:36,765 --> 01:35:38,244
Hi!

914
01:35:44,005 --> 01:35:45,006
Zoom in there.

915
01:36:29,317 --> 01:36:31,456
Sir, this is torture.

916
01:36:32,454 --> 01:36:34,297
My organs are confused now.

917
01:36:35,256 --> 01:36:36,997
I cannot wait any longer.

918
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:46,478
Nonsense..

919
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:51,276
Sir, he's on a date
without his security.

920
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:53,583
It's just him and a girl.

921
01:36:54,075 --> 01:36:55,076
We should go for him.

922
01:36:55,377 --> 01:36:58,017
Ajay is landing in
Kuala Lumpur today evening.

923
01:36:58,446 --> 01:37:00,551
Sir, that will be too late.
He'll give us the slip.

924
01:37:01,082 --> 01:37:03,460
We don't have a safe-house.
Where will you interrogate him?

925
01:37:04,119 --> 01:37:05,529
Sir, we'll turn this
place into a safe-house.

926
01:37:05,553 --> 01:37:06,553
We'll manage, Sir.

927
01:37:08,723 --> 01:37:09,997
Okay, go.

928
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:11,659
Isn't this great...

929
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:14,304
First, he ate for two hours
and then came here for dessert.

930
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:17,057
Hey...

931
01:38:17,458 --> 01:38:18,458
Later.

932
01:39:38,072 --> 01:39:39,176
Where's Mikhael, Tony?

933
01:40:08,736 --> 01:40:10,773
Stop! Stop...

934
01:40:11,305 --> 01:40:12,305
Please!

935
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:16,018
I don't know.

936
01:40:17,578 --> 01:40:19,489
He always meets in a new place.

937
01:40:20,782 --> 01:40:22,261
How do you contact him'?

938
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:30,101
No one contacts Mikhael.

939
01:40:31,593 --> 01:40:33,470
Mikhael contacts everyone.

940
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:38,574
Who are you guys trying
to find and where?

941
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:44,316
You've better chances of finding god.

942
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,040
Go back...

943
01:40:48,443 --> 01:40:52,084
And tell them to stop
wasting their time and money...

944
01:40:52,146 --> 01:40:54,092
in trying to find Mikhael.

945
01:40:57,085 --> 01:40:58,530
And wait for him to die.

946
01:41:03,458 --> 01:41:04,458
Hey...

947
01:41:04,592 --> 01:41:05,593
What's this?

948
01:41:05,693 --> 01:41:07,263
If you're of no use to us...

949
01:41:07,462 --> 01:41:08,672
then what's the point
in keeping you alive?

950
01:41:08,696 --> 01:41:10,733
Hold on... Hold on, please.

951
01:41:14,669 --> 01:41:15,669
Please...

952
01:41:23,044 --> 01:41:25,718
I want safe passage to Dubai.

953
01:41:26,514 --> 01:41:29,757
And you won't lay
another finger on me.

954
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:33,094
I have only one lead.

955
01:41:34,155 --> 01:41:35,463
I can give you that...

956
01:41:36,491 --> 01:41:37,765
and the rest is up to you.

957
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:41,640
Agreed?
no...

958
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:44,403
No deals for you.

959
01:41:49,337 --> 01:41:50,543
Then why did you stop?

960
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:53,640
Shoot...

961
01:41:55,276 --> 01:41:56,311
Finish me.

962
01:42:02,249 --> 01:42:04,195
Your tip should be right, Tony.

963
01:42:04,552 --> 01:42:05,552
Speak.

964
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:13,298
There's a doctor...

965
01:42:15,029 --> 01:42:16,633
in Berlin, Germany.

966
01:42:18,166 --> 01:42:19,440
Adolf Beckenheimer.

967
01:42:22,070 --> 01:42:24,072
You can try getting information...

968
01:42:24,405 --> 01:42:26,043
about Mikhael out of him.

969
01:42:26,274 --> 01:42:27,309
Means?

970
01:42:30,178 --> 01:42:33,421
Which picture of Mikhael do you have?

971
01:42:37,285 --> 01:42:38,355
Two years ago.

972
01:42:42,624 --> 01:42:46,162
Do you know... How
Mikhael looks like now?

973
01:42:47,328 --> 01:42:48,739
And you've set out to get him.

974
01:42:51,766 --> 01:42:54,542
Adolf Beckenheimer
is a plastic surgeon.

975
01:42:55,269 --> 01:42:56,407
The best.

976
01:42:57,505 --> 01:42:59,416
Some time ago, Mikhael went to him...

977
01:42:59,473 --> 01:43:01,248
and changed his face.

978
01:43:02,043 --> 01:43:06,719
If anyone knows anything about him,
then that's the doctor.

979
01:43:08,482 --> 01:43:12,225
Mikhael goes to him
for follow-ups as well.

980
01:43:21,996 --> 01:43:22,474
Sir...

981
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:23,697
Yes.

982
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:49,462
Good afternoon ma'am.

983
01:43:53,494 --> 01:43:55,132
Tomorrow.
thank you.

984
01:44:15,015 --> 01:44:16,221
Excuse me.

985
01:44:18,519 --> 01:44:19,623
I have to go to the toilet.

986
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:29,262
Why?

987
01:44:30,365 --> 01:44:32,402
I thought you had
to be smart for this job.

988
01:44:32,667 --> 01:44:33,987
Why does anyone go to the toilet?

989
01:44:34,168 --> 01:44:35,545
Sorry... sorry...

990
01:44:35,703 --> 01:44:38,411
Gupta, release him.

991
01:44:38,673 --> 01:44:39,673
Take him along.

992
01:44:39,741 --> 01:44:42,745
And listen,
if he makes one wrong move, shoot him.

993
01:45:15,443 --> 01:45:16,717
Door..

994
01:47:38,586 --> 01:47:39,586
Hello.

995
01:47:40,487 --> 01:47:42,558
Sir, the information was right.

996
01:47:42,623 --> 01:47:43,658
He is completely changed.

997
01:47:43,991 --> 01:47:44,991
Send me a scan.

998
01:49:56,624 --> 01:49:59,104
Send backup to the last coordinate.
Ask them to clean up.

999
01:50:18,178 --> 01:50:19,858
Sir, the constructive
surgery was too good.

1000
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:23,218
We could've never known
that Tony is Mikhael.

1001
01:50:23,417 --> 01:50:25,226
Multiple jaw surgeries.

1002
01:50:25,486 --> 01:50:27,329
The lower jaw has been cut.

1003
01:50:27,721 --> 01:50:28,426
See here...

1004
01:50:28,656 --> 01:50:31,535
The chin line has been
achieved through skin grafting.

1005
01:50:31,725 --> 01:50:35,366
Doctor, while you're
at it... Make me more handsome.

1006
01:50:39,066 --> 01:50:40,807
Hair transplant, skin tightening...

1007
01:50:41,101 --> 01:50:43,513
And finally,
he had his frontal teeth removed...

1008
01:50:43,604 --> 01:50:47,051
and replaced with artificial
teeth and got this look.

1009
01:50:47,675 --> 01:50:50,679
It's an extremely complex,
painful and risky procedure.

1010
01:50:51,178 --> 01:50:54,455
Sir, this is why he
has fooled all the agencies.

1011
01:50:55,049 --> 01:50:58,053
If we don't catch him
in the next 48 hours, then...

1012
01:50:58,218 --> 01:50:59,218
Where is Shabana?

1013
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:11,100
Shabana.

1014
01:51:12,133 --> 01:51:13,373
Get changed and come out.

1015
01:51:14,235 --> 01:51:15,235
Sir.

1016
01:51:19,206 --> 01:51:20,742
Yes, Sir. Where are we headed?

1017
01:51:21,575 --> 01:51:22,576
Shabana, it's time.

1018
01:51:24,044 --> 01:51:25,045
Time for what, Sir?

1019
01:51:25,612 --> 01:51:27,057
Time to get killed.

1020
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:30,184
Sir, can I ask you something?

1021
01:51:30,618 --> 01:51:31,618
Sure.

1022
01:51:32,052 --> 01:51:33,554
How are you so motivational?

1023
01:53:01,041 --> 01:53:02,281
Hi, Sir.
Hi.

1024
01:53:05,445 --> 01:53:06,445
How are you'?

1025
01:53:06,547 --> 01:53:07,547
I am fine.

1026
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:12,463
These walls gets to me... Just a sec...

1027
01:53:15,189 --> 01:53:16,189
Are you ready?

1028
01:53:17,591 --> 01:53:18,626
Don't know, Sir.

1029
01:53:19,993 --> 01:53:21,165
Come, let's find out.

1030
01:53:26,433 --> 01:53:29,073
Mikhael... Arms supplier.

1031
01:53:30,171 --> 01:53:32,117
One of the world's most wanted.

1032
01:53:32,706 --> 01:53:35,118
All the agencies in
the world are after him.

1033
01:53:35,442 --> 01:53:38,787
Mikhael controls Bangladesh,
Pakistan, Afghanistan and India...

1034
01:53:39,046 --> 01:53:40,457
and supplies arms.

1035
01:53:41,148 --> 01:53:42,258
And the same arms network...

1036
01:53:42,282 --> 01:53:44,626
is used for drugs
and human trafficking.

1037
01:53:45,218 --> 01:53:49,166
It's believed that his market
share in this region is 75%.

1038
01:53:49,456 --> 01:53:51,527
We've been bleeding
everywhere because of him.

1039
01:53:51,792 --> 01:53:56,571
Last year, Mikhael changed
his face after surgery.

1040
01:53:57,264 --> 01:54:00,370
So Tony a.K.A. Mikhael duped us...

1041
01:54:00,467 --> 01:54:02,071
and managed to give us the slip.

1042
01:54:02,469 --> 01:54:04,210
You mean he's out of our grasp.

1043
01:54:04,605 --> 01:54:05,640
Not exactly.

1044
01:54:06,673 --> 01:54:10,052
So someone did the standard procedure.
Yes, Sir.

1045
01:54:10,611 --> 01:54:13,251
When Tony was unconscious
Ravi injected him with a tracker.

1046
01:54:13,347 --> 01:54:14,155
Where?

1047
01:54:14,314 --> 01:54:15,452
On his toe-nail.

1048
01:54:15,682 --> 01:54:16,682
Precisely, Sir.

1049
01:54:18,485 --> 01:54:19,225
Toe-nail.

1050
01:54:19,453 --> 01:54:21,558
We know where he is, until...

1051
01:54:21,655 --> 01:54:24,101
Until he doesn't get a pedicure.

1052
01:54:24,425 --> 01:54:25,995
Which he did today.

1053
01:54:26,527 --> 01:54:28,438
Because the dot stopped moving, Sir.

1054
01:54:29,063 --> 01:54:30,303
Last he was in Melaka.

1055
01:54:30,697 --> 01:54:32,937
This is our only chance, Sir.
We shouldn't delay anymore.

1056
01:54:33,066 --> 01:54:34,344
Otherwise, he can disappear again.

1057
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:36,245
This is our chance... To do what, Sir?

1058
01:54:36,436 --> 01:54:37,574
To eliminate Tony.

1059
01:54:38,472 --> 01:54:41,078
This battle is never going to end.

1060
01:54:41,341 --> 01:54:43,520
What matters is who has the
higher score on the point table.

1061
01:54:43,544 --> 01:54:45,524
Us... or him?

1062
01:54:46,446 --> 01:54:48,357
We can move a step ahead...

1063
01:54:48,415 --> 01:54:50,452
when we push them two steps behind.

1064
01:54:51,185 --> 01:54:53,187
In that case, we should go after Tony.

1065
01:54:53,754 --> 01:54:56,132
I won't ask you about your plan.

1066
01:54:56,390 --> 01:55:00,202
But keep as few people
in the loop as possible.

1067
01:55:00,427 --> 01:55:01,427
Thank you, Sir.

1068
01:55:01,695 --> 01:55:03,299
Sir, what about the 'baby project'?

1069
01:55:03,630 --> 01:55:05,132
There's a meeting next week.

1070
01:55:05,532 --> 01:55:06,738
You know these idiots.

1071
01:55:07,734 --> 01:55:11,011
They are always sleeping
until there isn't a blast or two'?

1072
01:55:11,739 --> 01:55:16,245
By the way, who is this girl
that you're so confident about?

1073
01:55:16,443 --> 01:55:18,286
Sir, name's Shabana.

1074
01:55:36,329 --> 01:55:38,729
You will land in Kuala Lumpur
and head straight to the hotel.

1075
01:55:38,999 --> 01:55:41,502
And wait for your team leader's call.

1076
01:55:42,469 --> 01:55:44,142
He's already arrived.

1077
01:55:44,404 --> 01:55:46,645
And by the time you get there...

1078
01:55:47,207 --> 01:55:49,244
he must already have a plan.

1079
01:56:05,159 --> 01:56:06,159
Thank you, ma'am.

1080
01:56:44,231 --> 01:56:47,508
"Let's brush aside the world...

1081
01:56:47,567 --> 01:56:51,174
"and have fun."

1082
01:56:51,238 --> 01:56:54,515
"Let's brush aside all the bonds...

1083
01:56:54,574 --> 01:56:59,614
"and get high."

1084
01:57:08,488 --> 01:57:12,061
"Let's brush aside the world...

1085
01:57:12,125 --> 01:57:15,368
"and have fun."

1086
01:57:15,462 --> 01:57:18,705
"Let's brush aside all the bonds...

1087
01:57:18,999 --> 01:57:22,378
"and get high."

1088
01:57:22,436 --> 01:57:24,245
"The nights.

1089
01:57:24,404 --> 01:57:27,749
"The nights are really long."

1090
01:57:28,008 --> 01:57:31,353
"The talks are getting crazy."

1091
01:57:31,411 --> 01:57:32,719
"Let's do something.

1092
01:57:33,013 --> 01:57:35,550
"Going beyond all the limits."

1093
01:57:36,583 --> 01:57:38,654
"The heart's being naughty..."

1094
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:43,464
"because it's become shameless."

1095
01:57:43,523 --> 01:57:45,662
"The heart's being reveling..."

1096
01:57:45,725 --> 01:57:50,196
"because it's become shameless."

1097
01:58:04,278 --> 01:58:07,555
"It's become shameless."

1098
01:58:07,614 --> 01:58:11,289
"It's become shameless."

1099
01:58:11,318 --> 01:58:14,492
"There's nothing wrong
in being a little spoiled."

1100
01:58:14,621 --> 01:58:18,159
"We're selfish and
the heart's greedy too."

1101
01:58:18,225 --> 01:58:21,434
"The world objects meeting openly..."

1102
01:58:21,528 --> 01:58:25,101
"yet the heart never
stops from meeting at nights."

1103
01:58:25,165 --> 01:58:28,476
"There's nothing wrong
in being a little spoiled."

1104
01:58:28,535 --> 01:58:32,073
"We're selfish and
the heart's greedy too."

1105
01:58:32,139 --> 01:58:35,450
"The world objects meeting openly..."

1106
01:58:35,509 --> 01:58:38,718
"yet the heart never
stops from meeting at nights."

1107
01:58:38,979 --> 01:58:41,016
"The nights.

1108
01:58:41,081 --> 01:58:44,255
"The nights are really long."

1109
01:58:44,317 --> 01:58:47,662
"The talks are getting crazy."

1110
01:58:47,721 --> 01:58:49,428
"Let's do something.

1111
01:58:49,489 --> 01:58:52,265
"Going beyond all the limits."

1112
01:58:55,062 --> 01:58:57,099
"The heart's being naughty..."

1113
01:58:57,197 --> 01:59:01,976
"because it's become shameless."

1114
01:59:02,035 --> 01:59:04,413
"The heart's being reveling..."

1115
01:59:04,471 --> 01:59:08,248
"because it's become shameless."

1116
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:15,360
"It's become shameless."

1117
01:59:16,049 --> 01:59:20,020
"Let's brush aside the world...

1118
01:59:20,120 --> 01:59:24,466
"and have fun."

1119
01:59:44,278 --> 01:59:45,278
Hello.

1120
01:59:45,378 --> 01:59:46,378
In a conference.

1121
01:59:46,413 --> 01:59:47,483
I'll call you later.

1122
01:59:52,986 --> 01:59:54,260
Always in a conference.

1123
02:00:04,364 --> 02:00:05,434
Thank you.

1124
02:00:16,743 --> 02:00:18,450
You're just...
Sorry.

1125
02:00:22,015 --> 02:00:23,050
Who is she?

1126
02:00:24,117 --> 02:00:25,596
That's not important, Sona.

1127
02:00:26,119 --> 02:00:30,261
All you need to know is that you
must answer her questions correctly.

1128
02:00:30,490 --> 02:00:33,369
I must tell you that
she has a bad temper.

1129
02:00:33,727 --> 02:00:34,727
Bye.

1130
02:00:44,504 --> 02:00:46,484
Tony and Mikhael's
right hand is Malik.

1131
02:00:46,706 --> 02:00:48,413
Sona knows where we can find Malik.

1132
02:00:48,508 --> 02:00:51,512
And Malik knows where
we can find Mikhael.

1133
02:01:46,666 --> 02:01:48,304
We can find Malik in his factory.

1134
02:01:48,502 --> 02:01:50,140
Port Klang, Unit 14B.

1135
02:01:50,337 --> 02:01:51,614
He's always there till late night.

1136
02:01:51,638 --> 02:01:53,049
Tonight will be good.

1137
02:01:53,540 --> 02:01:54,540
Good.

1138
02:01:55,074 --> 02:01:56,074
And sona?

1139
02:01:56,109 --> 02:01:57,109
She's unconscious.

1140
02:01:57,544 --> 02:01:58,544
Very good.

1141
02:01:59,512 --> 02:02:01,048
By the way, you didn't need me.

1142
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:02,559
You could've asked her yourself.

1143
02:02:04,984 --> 02:02:07,260
Would I have looked coercing her?

1144
02:04:15,281 --> 02:04:17,454
Let me call you back. Bye.

1145
02:04:31,765 --> 02:04:33,403
Sir, with your permission, may I...

1146
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:36,774
I've come a long way.
Let me do something.

1147
02:04:37,671 --> 02:04:38,741
Wait outside.

1148
02:04:39,172 --> 02:04:40,172
Thank you.

1149
02:04:42,242 --> 02:04:43,242
Okay Sir.

1150
02:04:45,745 --> 02:04:47,656
I don't know about you guys...

1151
02:04:48,348 --> 02:04:50,555
but you don't have much time.

1152
02:04:51,184 --> 02:04:56,327
And you've no clue about
how much I can endure.

1153
02:04:57,157 --> 02:04:59,068
The elders were right, buddy.

1154
02:04:59,793 --> 02:05:02,501
Don't open your mouth... Until
it's not absolutely necessary.

1155
02:05:04,430 --> 02:05:05,636
Where is Tony, Malik?

1156
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:08,350
Did you find out anything?

1157
02:08:09,715 --> 02:08:10,989
What did you think?

1158
02:08:18,725 --> 02:08:20,402
Sir, Mikhael will be
getting admitted today...

1159
02:08:20,426 --> 02:08:21,962
in HSC Medical Center,
Kuala Lumpur.

1160
02:08:22,128 --> 02:08:24,074
Two doctors from India
have been flown here.

1161
02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:25,641
They are going to
operate on him today.

1162
02:08:25,665 --> 02:08:27,474
So he's changing his face again.

1163
02:08:28,101 --> 02:08:29,101
Yes.

1164
02:08:29,169 --> 02:08:30,169
Now?

1165
02:08:31,003 --> 02:08:32,676
We'll do it today, Sir.

1166
02:08:33,139 --> 02:08:34,139
How?

1167
02:08:34,173 --> 02:08:35,311
Don't know yet, Sir.

1168
02:08:36,509 --> 02:08:38,250
Must be your support
and logistics guy.

1169
02:08:38,377 --> 02:08:39,117
Bye.

1170
02:08:39,178 --> 02:08:40,178
Sir.

1171
02:08:49,555 --> 02:08:50,555
Hello.

1172
02:09:04,103 --> 02:09:06,140
Who is she?

1173
02:09:06,306 --> 02:09:07,306
She's sona.

1174
02:09:08,074 --> 02:09:09,485
That's all you ever want to do.

1175
02:09:10,309 --> 02:09:11,309
Better mend your ways.

1176
02:09:12,011 --> 02:09:13,012
If the people find out...

1177
02:09:13,079 --> 02:09:15,119
this is what you're
doing with their tax money...

1178
02:09:15,615 --> 02:09:17,175
then you know what's
going to happen.

1179
02:09:23,089 --> 02:09:25,000
This is the hospital's blueprint.

1180
02:09:25,558 --> 02:09:26,558
What do you think?

1181
02:09:29,061 --> 02:09:30,301
You're definitely going to die.

1182
02:09:30,730 --> 02:09:31,731
Are you doing this?

1183
02:09:32,332 --> 02:09:34,175
No... she is.

1184
02:09:39,205 --> 02:09:40,205
What's your name?

1185
02:09:40,373 --> 02:09:41,373
Shabana.

1186
02:09:43,376 --> 02:09:44,616
She is definitely going to die.

1187
02:09:45,645 --> 02:09:47,147
There must be some way, Mr. Shukla.

1188
02:09:49,582 --> 02:09:51,323
What will you guys ever do without me?

1189
02:10:46,172 --> 02:10:47,549
Hello.
Sir, Ranvir.

1190
02:10:48,241 --> 02:10:50,221
It's confirmed Intel.
We can do it today.

1191
02:10:50,343 --> 02:10:51,549
We need a go ahead, Sir.

1192
02:10:51,778 --> 02:10:53,121
Wait for my call.

1193
02:10:54,647 --> 02:10:57,127
I've written it down in my diary...

1194
02:10:57,784 --> 02:10:59,058
Hold on.

1195
02:11:01,053 --> 02:11:01,758
Yes, Sir.

1196
02:11:02,021 --> 02:11:03,261
I want to meet the minister.

1197
02:11:03,656 --> 02:11:05,567
Minister Sir is very busy.

1198
02:11:05,725 --> 02:11:06,999
It's impossible today.

1199
02:11:07,326 --> 02:11:08,669
Was it something urgent?

1200
02:11:10,196 --> 02:11:11,436
No, it's was nothing urgent.

1201
02:11:11,630 --> 02:11:12,630
Fine, thank you.

1202
02:11:13,265 --> 02:11:14,265
Hello...

1203
02:11:16,369 --> 02:11:18,645
Yes... consider it done.

1204
02:11:20,039 --> 02:11:20,540
Sir.

1205
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:23,577
Go ahead, and keep me posted.

1206
02:13:02,008 --> 02:13:03,578
Okay, guys, this is the plan.

1207
02:13:03,743 --> 02:13:06,587
Shabana, if you don't want to die
then listen to me carefully.

1208
02:13:07,013 --> 02:13:09,015
We'll replace you with a patient...

1209
02:13:09,048 --> 02:13:12,621
who's scheduled for a surgery in the other
O.T (Occupational Therapy) at the same time.

1210
02:14:26,626 --> 02:14:30,335
Shabana, your best friend in
this entire situation is 'adrenaline

1211
02:14:30,663 --> 02:14:33,041
you'll be sedated
in the pre-surgery room.

1212
02:14:33,332 --> 02:14:34,675
You'll be given Diazepam.

1213
02:14:35,134 --> 02:14:39,207
Ajay will inject you with
mode-alert 100 to nullify its effect.

1214
02:14:39,638 --> 02:14:41,311
But that won't do the trick alone.

1215
02:14:41,607 --> 02:14:45,111
You must inject yourself
with amphetamine...

1216
02:14:45,177 --> 02:14:47,384
within two minutes after
the nurse injecting you.

1217
02:14:47,780 --> 02:14:51,159
You will be unconscious
but only for a couple of minutes.

1218
02:14:51,384 --> 02:14:53,159
After that, you'll get to the O.T.

1219
02:14:53,218 --> 02:14:55,095
lock the doctors and nurses.

1220
02:14:55,421 --> 02:14:57,731
Tony will be injected with
local anesthesia until then.

1221
02:14:58,291 --> 02:14:59,395
It will be an easy kill.

1222
02:15:07,633 --> 02:15:09,144
Doctor, I don't want
to be unconscious.

1223
02:15:09,168 --> 02:15:10,238
I want to see everything.

1224
02:15:10,302 --> 02:15:13,112
Give me a local and perfect asepsis,
and give me a nerve block.

1225
02:15:13,272 --> 02:15:15,149
You need to Polish
this off in one session.

1226
02:15:15,207 --> 02:15:16,807
Take a look at this
and plan accordingly.

1227
02:15:17,076 --> 02:15:21,115
And yes... I expect you to arrange Hyperbaric
Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) for fast healing.

1228
02:15:21,513 --> 02:15:22,753
Go ahead please.

1229
02:15:23,749 --> 02:15:24,989
Stop.

1230
02:15:29,388 --> 02:15:31,425
Excuse me. Let her in.

1231
02:16:49,168 --> 02:16:51,148
Hello, Shukla.
Yes, Ajay.

1232
02:16:51,537 --> 02:16:52,379
What is the status?

1233
02:16:52,438 --> 02:16:54,179
Malik has been taken to the O.T.

1234
02:16:54,273 --> 02:16:55,752
Shabana's in the room outside.

1235
02:16:56,208 --> 02:16:58,449
We only have visuals
on the outside.

1236
02:16:58,678 --> 02:17:00,021
What now?

1237
02:17:00,312 --> 02:17:03,156
Play angry birds... And
wait for my call.

1238
02:18:04,076 --> 02:18:05,076
Move.

1239
02:18:06,979 --> 02:18:08,322
Move I said.

1240
02:18:08,581 --> 02:18:09,581
Move.

1241
02:18:09,715 --> 02:18:11,023
Inside.

1242
02:18:12,485 --> 02:18:14,089
Quick, move.

1243
02:20:37,429 --> 02:20:39,500
Shukla, call the police.

1244
02:22:25,771 --> 02:22:27,375
You okay?
Yes.

1245
02:22:27,772 --> 02:22:29,115
Move-move-move.

1246
02:22:56,267 --> 02:22:57,211
Yes, Shukla.

1247
02:22:57,269 --> 02:22:58,304
Ajay, get out.

1248
02:22:58,470 --> 02:23:01,383
I've called the police,
you've 3 minutes of total chaos.

1249
02:23:01,439 --> 02:23:03,009
How will we get out in 3 minutes'?

1250
02:23:03,208 --> 02:23:05,051
We're done for.
That's good.

1251
02:23:05,510 --> 02:23:07,490
We won't have to waste
money on your tickets.
