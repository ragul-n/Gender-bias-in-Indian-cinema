He will meet us at the statium directly.

28

Try it... you might like it.

29
00:06:04,955 --> 00:06:06,980
Don't move, fucker!

30
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,751
Everytime you move, somebody gets out.

31
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:20,495
Oh no... no!
Not Joshi.

32
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:22,968
No Captain...
don't send the tailenders up.

33
00:06:23,374 --> 00:06:24,671
He's just bad luck.

The cheque needs to be in the name of
Someshwar Charitable Trust.

36
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,293
Are you kidding?
A sports shop in a temple complex?

37
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:46,462
Why not?

38
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,794
Families of all kind throng the temple...

39
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:50,993
but the children tend to get bored.

40
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:54,494
Once this store opens...

41
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:56,435
trust me, the business will zoom off!

42
00:06:56,941 --> 00:06:58,670
lshaan has played at the district level...

43
00:06:58,743 --> 00:06:59,835
the children here look up to him

44
00:07:00,444 --> 00:07:02,435
He is quite excited about this business.

45
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,410
Excitement alone doesn't help.

46
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,485
You need to slog your ass off...

47
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:13,790
which 'His Highness' has never done.

48
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:15,792
He will, uncle.

49
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:30,940
No way! She went on a date?

50
00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:31,975
Who told you?

51
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:34,970
What are you saying?
ls it true?

52
00:07:35,045 --> 00:07:36,910
l don't want to hear you,
go outside and babble.

53
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:40,280
Didn't you hear me?

54
00:07:42,286 --> 00:07:43,275
What are you staring at?

55
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:44,283
Scram!

56
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:46,285
So what were you saying?

57
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:52,960
Thank you!

58
00:07:54,498 --> 00:07:54,987
Pen...

59
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,611
Dude, the headlight is broken...

60
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:21,723
Bloody hell...

61
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,728
Sonuvabitch! Showing off in your Lancer.

62
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:28,023
How does your horn go?

63
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,768
Listen...

64
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:33,394
lf l ever see you again in this block...

65
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,906
you'll hear the sound
coming out of your ass!

66
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,965
lsh...
let him go!

67
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:41,341
lshaan...
what's got into you?

68
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:43,471
He's been troubling Vidya for weeks.

69
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:45,273
Now he's come to say sorry.

70
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,681
This is dad...

71
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:49,012
- Say sorry to him.
- Sorry...

72
00:08:50,754 --> 00:08:52,483
When will you say sorry?

73
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:56,549
When will you say sorry
to your own dad?

74
00:08:57,428 --> 00:08:59,726
You've been sitting idle
for two years...

75
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,595
and you want to teach the world
what's right and what's not?

76
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:06,593
What are you looking at?

77
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:08,436
lshaan!

78
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,939
Nowjust scram!

79
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,535
Forget it.

80
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,470
Come on, Omi!

81
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:16,470
Wait!

82
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,950
Keep watching cricket
with your good-for-nothing friends.

83
00:09:21,585 --> 00:09:23,985
And then come running
to me for your cable tv bills.

84
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:27,247
This is how you will run your business?

85
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,690
Uncle, it's that guy's fault...

86
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,726
Shut up!

87
00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:34,287
You all keep covering up
for each other.

88
00:09:34,665 --> 00:09:36,257
You boys are
good for nothing!

89
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:38,725
Where's my cheque?

90
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,995
No, uncle! Don't.

91
00:09:43,274 --> 00:09:45,265
lt is our future!

92
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:46,439
Please!

93
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,710
lshaan, come off it, man.

94
00:09:48,946 --> 00:09:50,538
We won't get the shop.

95
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,413
He'll apologise, uncle.

96
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:53,381
Apologise!

97
00:09:54,518 --> 00:09:55,610
Apologise!

98
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,717
l don't want his money!

99
00:09:58,656 --> 00:10:00,419
Uncle...

100
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:03,792
No, uncle, please!

101
00:10:15,472 --> 00:10:16,530
lshaan, where are you going?

102
00:10:16,607 --> 00:10:18,541
Go home, it's time for your prayer.

103
00:10:40,331 --> 00:10:42,026
lsh... watch out!

104
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:49,362
Ball please!

105
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:53,674
Who hit that?

106
00:10:53,744 --> 00:10:55,473
Some new kid...

107
00:10:55,546 --> 00:10:57,070
not from our block.

108
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:12,386
Your dad's going a little cuckoo...

109
00:11:12,763 --> 00:11:14,458
don't take it to your heart!

110
00:11:14,732 --> 00:11:15,960
l've had enough.

111
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:19,031
l feel like running away from it all.

112
00:11:19,536 --> 00:11:21,561
We can keep running all our life...

113
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:23,536
Right?

114
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:27,036
At least today you should've kept your cool.

115
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:30,904
lt wasn't easy convincing your dad...

116
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,041
l had a signed cheque in my pocket.

117
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:37,514
What about all the stuff he said?
That's nothing?

118
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,858
We deserve some respect.

119
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,795
Get serious, guys!

120
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:52,426
We can't hang around this block forever!

121
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,095
l can't give private tuitions until 2015!

122
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,331
l don't want to earn a living
selling chips and crackers.

123
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,672
lsh, you'd have enjoyed it.

124
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,673
Omi and l would run the store...
while you could coach the kids.

125
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:05,404
l had worked out every detail!

126
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,284
You're right...

127
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:11,781
We have to do something...

128
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,986
lf we don't move now,
we'll be stuck here forever.

129
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:19,386
You're right.

130
00:12:21,398 --> 00:12:22,831
How do we raise the lease deposit?

131
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:27,403
You have to steal the temple donation box.

132
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,669
He is kidding.

133
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:34,309
Omi, talk to your dad...

134
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:36,712
Just make sure we don't lose the shop.

135
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:48,852
What do you know about stock and trade?

136
00:12:50,027 --> 00:12:51,824
Business is not child's play.

137
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:54,556
What if you suffer a loss?

138
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:57,791
Father, Govind has planned everything.

139
00:12:57,935 --> 00:13:00,995
The day we decide on the shop,
our partnership begins.

140
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:03,970
Bittoo looks after the Trust's workings.

141
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:09,045
l don't think it is right for me
to put in a word for you.

142
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,747
Don't listen to your father.

143
00:13:11,815 --> 00:13:14,750
Bittoo is your own uncle,
go and talk to him.

144
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:20,322
Cricket training-cum-sports shop?

145
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:21,582
Good!

146
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:24,317
Many people have been
queueing up for that shop.

147
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:26,361
l have blocked it for you...

148
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,924
but that's no big deal.

149
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,961
Sports is an important discipline.

150
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:34,935
lt keeps the youth motivated.
That's good.

151
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:36,294
Sit...

152
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:38,899
So...

153
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:42,470
when do you want the keys?

154
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,608
Uncle, actually we haven't arranged
the lease deposit yet.

155
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:51,680
So, if you want to give it
to someone else...

156
00:13:52,022 --> 00:13:52,989
Vishwas...

157
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:58,590
Tell me, when are
you joining the party?

158
00:13:59,096 --> 00:14:01,621
What?
Party?

159
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:04,263
Why not?

160
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:07,259
What's wrong with politics?

161
00:14:10,874 --> 00:14:12,341
You are the son of a priest...

162
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,778
Once you set your mind on something,
you will succeed.

163
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,708
What?!

164
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,517
Don't worry about the lease deposit.

165
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,448
l am your uncle.

166
00:14:30,027 --> 00:14:31,051
Congratulations!

167
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:08,546
lt's important to set the bat
before you start to play.

168
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:12,281
This process is called 'knocking in'.

169
00:17:12,756 --> 00:17:14,724
Get to know your bat well...

170
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,624
and watch the fours
and sixes follow.

171
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:18,724
Got it?

172
00:17:18,962 --> 00:17:22,398
Govind bhai, we want two cricket bats
and a knocking hammer.

173
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:36,712
No matter how fast l bowl,
he slams it for a six.

174
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,338
Here...

175
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:40,575
This is how you grip the ball.

176
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:43,909
Why don't you mix it up..
bowl a slower one...

177
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:45,686
Drain the ball of its speed...

178
00:17:46,623 --> 00:17:49,649
lf the ball doesn't reach the bat,
there's no way he can hit it for a six.

179
00:18:14,951 --> 00:18:16,612
l tried everything but...

180
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:19,415
he still hits every ball for a six!

181
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:24,323
Ali?

182
00:18:27,464 --> 00:18:28,396
Come on Ali...

183
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:29,955
lshaan is here to watch you play.

184
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,314
Champ...

185
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,683
These marbles won't live
to see another day!

186
00:18:57,994 --> 00:18:59,894
Hey... give me those marbles.

187
00:19:24,254 --> 00:19:24,845
Listen...

188
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,983
l'll play one over, that's it.

189
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,658
lf l hit sixes, those marbles are mine.

190
00:19:31,928 --> 00:19:34,624
Yeah... and how many sixes will you hit?

191
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:35,754
Six.

192
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:55,875
What a shot!

193
00:21:32,515 --> 00:21:34,676
Sometimes weakness can lead to headaches...

194
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,379
might be a simple case of low blood pressure.

195
00:21:37,654 --> 00:21:40,953
Lack of hydration and
poor diet can also act as a trigger.

196
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,059
We will do a couple of scans.

197
00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:46,423
He should be fine,
don't worry.

198
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:51,322
But doctor, he hit ME for
three sixes one after another.

199
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,633
Some people are naturally gifted...

200
00:21:53,737 --> 00:21:56,865
a speeding ball appears as big as
a football to them.

201
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,374
You can call it hyper-reflex...

202
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:00,941
hand-eye coordination...

203
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:02,437
or God's gift.

204
00:22:13,823 --> 00:22:15,814
Three sixes in a row!

205
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,817
lt's not a mean feat...

206
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:19,961
there's something about him.

207
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:21,827
Look at this...

208
00:22:22,465 --> 00:22:24,456
Have you even heard
a word of what l've said?

209
00:22:24,534 --> 00:22:25,466
Take a look...

210
00:22:25,835 --> 00:22:26,494
read it...

211
00:22:27,437 --> 00:22:28,699
An airconditioned mall...

212
00:22:28,905 --> 00:22:30,839
buyers get possession next January.

213
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:33,537
There's an early bird discount too.

214
00:22:34,377 --> 00:22:35,344
Another shop?

215
00:22:36,946 --> 00:22:38,413
Why go for another one?

216
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:40,873
What's wrong with this?

217
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,349
There's nothing wrong.

218
00:22:42,385 --> 00:22:43,579
Did l say anything?

219
00:22:44,354 --> 00:22:45,946
lsh, listen to me...

220
00:22:46,356 --> 00:22:47,482
Malls are the future.

221
00:22:47,924 --> 00:22:50,085
Mark my words, in a few years
every thing will be sold in malls.

222
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,793
Malls are the game changer.

223
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,691
Oh really?
But they're not free, are they?

224
00:22:57,701 --> 00:22:58,429
Govi...

225
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:02,632
We've barely begun this business,
why take unnecessary risks?

226
00:23:03,306 --> 00:23:04,671
You are so negative!

227
00:23:05,475 --> 00:23:06,567
Rot here all your life.

228
00:23:06,643 --> 00:23:07,302
Give it back!

229
00:23:07,343 --> 00:23:07,900
Hey!

230
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:09,273
Omi...

231
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:12,279
Wow...

232
00:23:13,316 --> 00:23:13,907
Hello, uncle...

233
00:23:14,584 --> 00:23:15,516
sit...

234
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:17,377
Wow!

235
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,519
Not bad!

236
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,921
l like what you've done to this place.

237
00:23:23,426 --> 00:23:25,291
Uncle, haven't seen you in a while.

238
00:23:25,328 --> 00:23:27,387
We were campaigning all over Gujarat.

239
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,628
l got some Lord's blessings...
for everyone.

240
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,704
Sir...

241
00:23:38,475 --> 00:23:39,373
mind if l...

242
00:23:43,613 --> 00:23:45,046
Careful, it's loaded.

243
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:48,711
Parekhji gave it... for protection.

244
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:50,446
Politics is a tricky game...

245
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,818
The more you help people,
the more enemies you make.

246
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:56,588
Omi, what have you been up to?

247
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,757
Come over to the party office...

248
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:01,292
Sorry, uncle, haven't had time to breathe.

249
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,025
You know... setting up a new business...

250
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:08,631
Next week the senior party members
are coming to town.

251
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:10,867
You must come...

252
00:24:11,641 --> 00:24:14,269
in fact, all of you should.

253
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:16,835
Enroll yourselves at the party office.

254
00:24:17,313 --> 00:24:18,280
Of course, we will.

255
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,748
You guys need to be more pro-active now...

256
00:24:23,586 --> 00:24:25,315
the youth is the future of this country.

257
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:25,945
What the--

258
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:32,426
You take care...

259
00:24:32,495 --> 00:24:33,427
See you.

260
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,494
Have you lost it?

261
00:24:42,438 --> 00:24:44,668
l don't have time for this stupid politics.

262
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:46,307
Stupid politics?

263
00:24:46,743 --> 00:24:48,506
You think we'd get this shop
if it weren't for uncle?

264
00:24:48,578 --> 00:24:49,670
And what's he asking for?

265
00:24:49,846 --> 00:24:50,870
Just to attend the function.

266
00:24:51,314 --> 00:24:53,339
That's why l said we should buy
the shop at the mall.

267
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:54,883
At least we won't owe anyone anything!

268
00:24:55,051 --> 00:24:56,780
Do this, do that...

269
00:24:58,555 --> 00:24:59,522
Objection!

270
00:24:59,989 --> 00:25:02,890
My dear friend...
even if we buy a new shop...

271
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:04,357
we'll still need a training ground?

272
00:25:04,427 --> 00:25:04,950
Exactly!

273
00:25:07,597 --> 00:25:11,294
l think we should just go along with uncle.

274
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,767
l have a better idea!

275
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:18,769
At least listen to me...

276
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,673
hear me out.

277
00:25:21,511 --> 00:25:22,341
Why don't we...

278
00:25:23,513 --> 00:25:28,450
give him a tambourine, wear a skirt
and dance to his tunes!

279
00:25:28,518 --> 00:25:29,712
What do you have against my uncle?

280
00:25:29,786 --> 00:25:31,378
We're paying him rent, aren't we!

281
00:25:31,454 --> 00:25:32,751
My uncle has really helped us.

282
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,811
So have we.

283
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,448
Chill, you guys!

284
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:36,719
Why do you always talk about your uncle?

285
00:25:36,793 --> 00:25:37,623
Enough!

286
00:25:38,461 --> 00:25:42,056
The mall will work out and so will Parekhji...

287
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,624
Tomorrow is Sunday.

288
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:45,463
So?

289
00:25:45,668 --> 00:25:54,736
'Tomorrow is Sunday,
a day to drink away!'

290
00:25:54,811 --> 00:25:56,574
Why? What's the big occasion?

291
00:25:56,646 --> 00:25:57,442
You won the lottery?

292
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,842
You bloody Miser!

293
00:25:58,948 --> 00:26:00,313
Don't stop us!

294
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:01,747
l will pay from my share...

295
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,479
That's for the shop.

296
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:05,676
Sit down!

297
00:26:05,755 --> 00:26:07,382
Back off!

298
00:26:07,724 --> 00:26:09,351
lshaan...

299
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:10,357
take my share too.

300
00:26:10,426 --> 00:26:12,587
Well, the Sabarmati Sports Club
has enough in its coffers...

301
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:14,721
to sponsor your cheap beers.

302
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:16,490
Here's a grand!

303
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:19,802
The miser is on board! Yay!!

304
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,461
But we can't do this every month.

305
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:23,300
Absolutely!

306
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,639
Let me take care of this.

307
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:29,871
Give it back.

308
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:31,811
There, he's back to his calculations.

309
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,814
Smell this my friend...

310
00:28:46,816 --> 00:28:49,910
much better than your wads of cash.

311
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,749
Even to get here,
you need a piece of that wad.

312
00:28:52,822 --> 00:28:54,414
Shhh...

313
00:28:54,991 --> 00:28:57,016
no more talk of cash.

314
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,293
Let me enjoy the breeze.

315
00:29:00,997 --> 00:29:03,363
l'm with you, bro!

316
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,767
l should make a note of it.

317
00:29:05,668 --> 00:29:08,535
You guys are so goddamn drunk!

318
00:29:08,905 --> 00:29:09,963
Who is drunk?

319
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:12,005
Look...

320
00:29:12,575 --> 00:29:14,566
See l can walk in a straight line.

321
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:18,742
Walking is fine...

322
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,881
but can you run in a straight line?

323
00:29:23,286 --> 00:29:24,412
Yes, sir!

324
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,487
Go for it!

325
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,941
This is the good life.

326
00:30:32,855 --> 00:30:33,844
Tell me...

327
00:30:34,824 --> 00:30:35,688
Omi...

328
00:30:35,758 --> 00:30:38,090
When you become a hotshot politician...

329
00:30:39,095 --> 00:30:40,756
what's the first thing that you'll do?

330
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:45,028
l'll open a sports academy for you.

331
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:53,373
'lshaan Bhatt Sports Academy'

332
00:30:54,377 --> 00:30:58,473
Only for those who can't make it
beyond the local league.

333
00:30:59,015 --> 00:31:00,346
What do you mean?

334
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:01,577
Did you hear that?

335
00:31:01,851 --> 00:31:02,613
Cut it out, man!

336
00:31:02,985 --> 00:31:05,476
Everyone knows how biased
the selection process is.

337
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,748
Exactly!

338
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:13,920
He is still the best player in our district.

339
00:31:14,297 --> 00:31:17,061
That's like saying Vidya is
the 'Julia Roberts' of our district.

340
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,324
World famous in our neighbourhood.

341
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,638
Listen, Govi...

342
00:31:22,805 --> 00:31:24,500
her exams are coming up...

343
00:31:24,574 --> 00:31:25,802
you need to help her out with her math.

344
00:31:26,075 --> 00:31:28,373
But l teach kids.

345
00:31:28,711 --> 00:31:30,679
You scored a century in your board exams...

346
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:31,735
Cent percent.

347
00:31:31,814 --> 00:31:33,543
You'll dojust fine.

348
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,945
Now friends, let's step on the gas...

349
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,547
Let's hit it!

350
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,861
l hate Math.

351
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,872
Huh?

352
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,033
Huh, that's all?

353
00:31:59,642 --> 00:32:02,270
lf l had my way, l'd drop
Math from the syllabus. Just like that.

354
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,544
The world of numbers is magical.

355
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:14,515
You can fit the entire universe
in the digits from 0 to 9.

356
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:15,914
Huh?

357
00:32:18,427 --> 00:32:20,759
Once you get a hang of them,
you'll start to enjoy.

358
00:32:20,896 --> 00:32:22,921
Yuck!
Enjoy?

359
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:25,324
Everytime l hear the word 'Math',
l feel like throwing up.

360
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:27,434
Just say the word and...

361
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,501
see what l mean?

362
00:32:34,844 --> 00:32:37,472
Preeti!
My best friend.

363
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,938
Switch it off.
No mobile phones when l'm teaching.

364
00:32:40,449 --> 00:32:40,915
Just a minute!

365
00:32:40,983 --> 00:32:41,950
Switch it off.

366
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,630
Naseer Hashmi?
He is a member of uncle's rival political party.

367
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,030
Relax! You're not here to ask for his vote.

368
00:33:02,471 --> 00:33:03,460
Sir...

369
00:33:03,506 --> 00:33:05,599
Ali has been blessed by God.

370
00:33:05,741 --> 00:33:07,834
We don't know the extent of his talent yet.

371
00:33:08,844 --> 00:33:11,278
Let's begin with his fitness and training and...

372
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,416
in a few years, he will be
playing for the state, l assure you.

373
00:33:15,351 --> 00:33:16,443
But, son...

374
00:33:16,686 --> 00:33:19,951
cricket coaching is meant for the rich.

375
00:33:20,756 --> 00:33:22,815
No one will even acknowledge him...

376
00:33:23,426 --> 00:33:24,723
Oh come on!

377
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,328
Rich or poor, makes no difference to talent.

378
00:33:27,563 --> 00:33:29,656
Trust us, we'll take care of everything.

379
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,765
What's going on?

380
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:36,360
Dad, Ali stole my marbles.

381
00:33:36,572 --> 00:33:39,040
Now he's had it!

382
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:42,007
Who knows what else he has stolen!

383
00:33:48,017 --> 00:33:48,608
Ali...

384
00:33:48,684 --> 00:33:50,675
l won those marbles from him.

385
00:33:51,387 --> 00:33:52,911
l don't want to hear a thing.

386
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:54,481
Get out right now!

387
00:33:54,957 --> 00:33:55,981
Where are the marbles?

388
00:33:56,392 --> 00:33:56,949
l don't have them.

389
00:33:57,026 --> 00:33:58,823
He's lying!

390
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:00,028
Sir...

391
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,660
Are you talking about these marbles?

392
00:34:02,264 --> 00:34:03,322
l found them in this corner.

393
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,671
l have given up...

394
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:14,306
l can't take it anymore.

395
00:34:16,946 --> 00:34:19,744
Don't worry, sir.
He is just a kid.

396
00:34:20,549 --> 00:34:21,914
Look at Omi...

397
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,012
He was a terror round the block!

398
00:34:24,286 --> 00:34:25,776
Panditji didn't know what to do with him...

399
00:34:26,021 --> 00:34:28,421
Look at him now!!
Managing his own shop.

400
00:34:29,058 --> 00:34:29,922
Panditji?

401
00:34:30,326 --> 00:34:34,786
Pandit Shastri, the head priest of
Someshwar Temple, is Omi's father.

402
00:34:35,598 --> 00:34:37,793
Hmm... l know him.

403
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,025
Bittoo Joshi...

404
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:43,602
isn't he the trustee of the temple?

405
00:34:44,774 --> 00:34:46,036
He is my uncle.

406
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:48,907
He helped us with the training centre.

407
00:34:51,013 --> 00:34:51,741
lnteresting!

408
00:34:52,047 --> 00:34:53,537
So my son will...

409
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,714
learn from Bittoo's cronies?

410
00:34:56,352 --> 00:34:57,819
We are nobody's cronies, sir.

411
00:34:58,087 --> 00:35:00,385
Children from all over town
come to us for training.

412
00:35:01,257 --> 00:35:02,554
We treat everyone the same.

413
00:35:02,591 --> 00:35:03,558
lt's alright...

414
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,452
Our political party doesn't
believe in divide and rule.

415
00:35:08,464 --> 00:35:09,488
But...

416
00:35:10,032 --> 00:35:11,795
l suggest you ask him yourself.

417
00:35:11,867 --> 00:35:12,856
Ali...

418
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,036
You still owe me 3 sixes.

419
00:35:15,337 --> 00:35:16,031
See you at the nets tomorrow?.

420
00:35:16,972 --> 00:35:18,030
7 o'clock sharp!

421
00:35:19,842 --> 00:35:20,672
He's shy.

422
00:35:23,946 --> 00:35:24,674
Pull it...

423
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:26,648
Tighter!

424
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,816
Reverse.

425
00:35:33,722 --> 00:35:34,882
Do the same there.

426
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:49,367
So, Ali...

427
00:35:49,638 --> 00:35:51,572
how's it going?

428
00:35:52,908 --> 00:35:54,068
Look what l got for you.

429
00:36:03,986 --> 00:36:06,250
Here... this will protect you.

430
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:09,454
And...

431
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,320
keep this too.

432
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:12,655
This will...

433
00:36:13,729 --> 00:36:15,788
this will ensure
your family tree continues.

434
00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:33,507
Listen...

435
00:36:33,582 --> 00:36:35,482
He just hits on the leg-side.

436
00:36:35,918 --> 00:36:37,783
Seam pointing left, shiny side right.

437
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:40,050
Try bowling an out-swinger.

438
00:36:40,356 --> 00:36:41,448
Go on.

439
00:36:45,561 --> 00:36:46,323
Start.

440
00:36:52,735 --> 00:36:53,895
Well bowled...

441
00:37:10,452 --> 00:37:10,975
Nice ball.

442
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:16,258
60 degree...

443
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:19,289
angle A, B and...

444
00:37:21,363 --> 00:37:21,954
May l come in, sir?

445
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:23,521
What?

446
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:25,561
Thank you.

447
00:37:28,571 --> 00:37:29,037
Ali...

448
00:37:30,005 --> 00:37:31,438
What are the two sides of the pitch called?

449
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,935
Give me a few minutes,
this is very important.

450
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,709
What are the two sides of the pitch called?

451
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,603
Come on, Ali. lt's simple.

452
00:37:38,314 --> 00:37:40,976
For a right-handed batsman,
his right side is called 'off'...

453
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,847
and his left side is called 'on'.

454
00:37:42,985 --> 00:37:44,577
Just a minute.

455
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,980
lt's very important...

456
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:50,320
Ali, look here.

457
00:37:52,027 --> 00:37:55,326
You always play in one corner of the ground.

458
00:37:56,332 --> 00:37:57,993
The right side is blocked...

459
00:37:59,468 --> 00:38:00,730
with apartments and...

460
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:04,270
That's why you always hit
the ball on the 'on' side.

461
00:38:04,306 --> 00:38:06,274
Your 'off' side game is weak.

462
00:38:06,642 --> 00:38:10,635
What if the off-side is opened?

463
00:38:15,384 --> 00:38:15,941
Mid-off...

464
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,377
Cover...

465
00:38:18,387 --> 00:38:18,978
Point...

466
00:38:20,022 --> 00:38:20,818
Gully...

467
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:23,322
How will you play?

468
00:38:24,627 --> 00:38:27,926
lt's simple.
lf the ball is on the off-side...

469
00:38:28,964 --> 00:38:29,896
Off drive...

470
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:32,399
lf the ball is away from the cover...

471
00:38:33,268 --> 00:38:33,700
Cover drive...

472
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:35,998
lf the ball is pitched short...

473
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,333
Back-foot drive...

474
00:38:37,406 --> 00:38:39,533
lf the ball is outside the off-stump...

475
00:38:39,642 --> 00:38:42,907
use your wrist to hit a square cut
through the gully.

476
00:38:43,045 --> 00:38:47,414
And if a similar ball
is pitched a little full...

477
00:38:49,018 --> 00:38:49,916
Square drive.

478
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:54,654
Govi, understood?

479
00:38:55,024 --> 00:38:56,958
We need to crack his offside!

480
00:38:58,661 --> 00:38:59,389
Are you done?

481
00:38:59,461 --> 00:39:00,018
Yeah.

482
00:39:00,295 --> 00:39:00,818
Good.

483
00:39:02,231 --> 00:39:02,925
Take a break, guys!

484
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,964
The kid's got no stamina at all.

485
00:39:05,234 --> 00:39:07,964
And both Coach and Prof
are breathing down on him!

486
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,696
Come on Romeo!

487
00:39:10,873 --> 00:39:13,239
l'll tell you when you
really need stamina...

488
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:14,907
once you get married...

489
00:39:15,277 --> 00:39:16,335
Where's the blackboard duster?

490
00:39:18,714 --> 00:39:20,841
l'm tired! Let's take a break.

491
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:23,244
Let's solve this last one... 10 minutes more...

492
00:39:23,285 --> 00:39:25,253
Please! My brain is jammed.

493
00:39:27,256 --> 00:39:28,018
Fine.

494
00:39:28,857 --> 00:39:29,482
So...

495
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:32,687
So... nothing.

496
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,495
Tell me about your other subjects?

497
00:39:40,636 --> 00:39:43,605
You hate all of them?
Or is Math your special enemy?

498
00:39:45,974 --> 00:39:49,410
l think l have a soft corner for Biology.

499
00:39:50,412 --> 00:39:54,280
At least, it's about living things.
Things you can see... feel...

500
00:39:54,983 --> 00:39:58,817
This is your skin... the epidermis...

501
00:39:59,321 --> 00:39:59,878
did you feel that?

502
00:40:02,991 --> 00:40:05,516
l can touch it, stroke it!

503
00:40:05,594 --> 00:40:08,825
When l draw a diagram,
l know it exists in real life.

504
00:40:09,364 --> 00:40:11,457
Math is like an imaginary goblin...

505
00:40:13,402 --> 00:40:14,596
For example...

506
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,465
can you ever touch a bell curve?

507
00:40:17,573 --> 00:40:18,938
How's it going, professor?

508
00:40:24,313 --> 00:40:25,678
You look harrowed.

509
00:40:26,482 --> 00:40:26,971
No...

510
00:40:27,616 --> 00:40:30,608
Don't give up.
You'll get there... eventually!

511
00:40:31,086 --> 00:40:32,553
Okay, listen...

512
00:40:33,355 --> 00:40:34,947
l'm very excited about Ali's breakthrough.

513
00:40:35,557 --> 00:40:37,787
Once we fix his 'offside' problem,
think about it...

514
00:40:37,993 --> 00:40:39,585
he can then play both sides of the crease.

515
00:40:39,661 --> 00:40:41,330
And he won't need to hit every
ball out of the stadium.

516
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,058
Excuse me...

517
00:40:42,564 --> 00:40:46,330
You are disturbing my class,
please take your commentary outside!

518
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:48,892
What's got into her?

519
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,001
Unbelievable, Vidya!

520
00:40:52,474 --> 00:40:55,841
lf you study with this devotion,
you will win the Nobel prize!

521
00:40:56,044 --> 00:40:58,535
And l'll have to wait in queue
to get your book signed!

522
00:40:58,881 --> 00:41:00,439
Never seen such devotion to the books..

523
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,717
Carry on, l'll see you guys.

524
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,414
What are you doing next Thursday?

525
00:41:06,822 --> 00:41:07,880
Let's go somewhere.

526
00:41:12,461 --> 00:41:13,894
l'm free between 2 and 4 pm.

527
00:41:13,962 --> 00:41:16,954
l'll tell my folks that
l need to go to town to buy books.

528
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:18,730
Nothing to worry about.

529
00:41:19,535 --> 00:41:21,799
Please think up an alibi
and don't be late.

530
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:26,073
l don't want any excuses,
please!

531
00:41:31,346 --> 00:41:32,472
Here comes the marble champ!

532
00:41:33,715 --> 00:41:34,511
You are late!

533
00:41:34,716 --> 00:41:35,341
Kit up.

534
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,316
Hey... pyjama boy!

535
00:41:45,928 --> 00:41:48,829
And the balls are out of the stadium...
it's a sixer!

536
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,529
Break it up!

537
00:41:54,102 --> 00:41:55,899
First you come late for practice
and then get into a scrap.

538
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:58,565
Come on, get ready, quickly!

539
00:42:03,946 --> 00:42:06,540
Ali, listen,
no shots on the leg-side today.

540
00:42:06,615 --> 00:42:09,277
Otherwise 5 laps of the ground.

541
00:42:09,718 --> 00:42:11,686
Pintoo, come here...

542
00:42:12,054 --> 00:42:13,681
bowl an out-swinger.

543
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,014
Only concentrate on your off.

544
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:18,519
Don't take your eyes off the ball...
focus!

545
00:42:36,078 --> 00:42:39,047
Didn't you hear what
l've been telling you?

546
00:42:39,514 --> 00:42:40,947
Are you deaf?
Or are you an ass?

547
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:41,914
Duffer!

548
00:42:43,585 --> 00:42:45,348
l need to leave early today.

549
00:42:45,654 --> 00:42:46,348
Why?

550
00:42:46,588 --> 00:42:48,852
There's a marble tournament
in my block today.

551
00:42:55,631 --> 00:42:56,655
Why are you following me around?

552
00:42:56,798 --> 00:42:57,730
Go, take guard at the crease.

553
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,067
You can't hit a single ball on the off...

554
00:43:00,335 --> 00:43:01,597
but its important to go to
that damn marble tournament.

555
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,932
lt's the final today.

556
00:43:03,405 --> 00:43:04,599
l don't believe this,

557
00:43:07,609 --> 00:43:08,837
To hell with your final!

558
00:43:09,011 --> 00:43:11,809
We're working day and night
to get you trained...

559
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,508
what are you going to achieve
by playing marbles?

560
00:43:19,321 --> 00:43:20,811
And what have you achieved?

561
00:43:24,626 --> 00:43:25,558
What did you say?

562
00:43:26,295 --> 00:43:26,556
What?

563
00:43:26,628 --> 00:43:27,720
What have you achieved?

564
00:43:45,347 --> 00:43:46,609
Did you see his attitude?

565
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,611
How does one teach them discipline?

566
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:51,543
lt has to be give and take...

567
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,383
l can't do everything on my own.

568
00:43:57,025 --> 00:43:59,016
Just because you are working with kids,
you can't behave like one.

569
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,584
Get a handle on things..

570
00:44:00,662 --> 00:44:01,629
But you know...

571
00:44:02,798 --> 00:44:04,493
he shouldn't have said that to lshaan.

572
00:44:04,967 --> 00:44:06,901
l have nothing personal against him.

573
00:44:07,669 --> 00:44:10,467
All l want is for him to become
a great cricketer...

574
00:44:10,539 --> 00:44:12,598
while all he wants to do is play marbles.

575
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:15,799
lsh...

576
00:44:16,678 --> 00:44:18,646
You have to see this through,
at least for yourself!

577
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:20,577
Get it?

578
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,574
Don't quit again.

579
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:25,781
l want a shuttlecock.

580
00:44:26,054 --> 00:44:26,986
Come here.

581
00:44:27,622 --> 00:44:28,418
Don't worry!

582
00:44:28,557 --> 00:44:29,319
15 rupees.

583
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,658
Have you noticed that
the other boys bully him?

584
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:36,059
He probably gets frustrated.
Give him some time.

585
00:44:38,934 --> 00:44:39,662
What's this?

586
00:44:40,902 --> 00:44:42,836
7 rupees?

587
00:44:43,939 --> 00:44:44,997
Go get the rest.

588
00:44:45,941 --> 00:44:47,568
l shouldn't have hit him.

589
00:44:48,744 --> 00:44:49,642
lt's ok!

590
00:44:49,945 --> 00:44:50,912
Go on!

591
00:44:51,847 --> 00:44:52,871
Here. take this.

592
00:44:53,348 --> 00:44:54,007
Here, go play.

593
00:44:54,082 --> 00:44:55,379
What the hell...

594
00:44:55,751 --> 00:44:57,013
Deduct it from my share.

595
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,678
lsh, you're an idiot!

596
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,549
Ali will come back...
no?

597
00:45:05,861 --> 00:45:06,555
Give me 8 rupees.

598
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,555
l want 8 rupees.

599
00:45:09,798 --> 00:45:10,696
Hassan bhai?

600
00:45:11,033 --> 00:45:11,727
Yes.

601
00:45:12,734 --> 00:45:14,599
Hassan bhai, this is Govind...

602
00:45:15,904 --> 00:45:16,734
Yes...

603
00:45:18,907 --> 00:45:19,999
4 o'clock is fine.

604
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:22,506
Okay.

605
00:45:29,985 --> 00:45:31,543
A sports shop here?

606
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,276
ln this cowshed?

607
00:45:34,322 --> 00:45:35,846
This place stinks of poop!

608
00:45:36,391 --> 00:45:37,323
Can it get any worse?!

609
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,550
lt's right next to the toilet!

610
00:45:39,694 --> 00:45:43,289
This is the only site
that suits your budget.

611
00:45:43,965 --> 00:45:47,423
Loosen your purse a bit...

612
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:50,337
l'll show you a better site.

613
00:45:50,672 --> 00:45:53,300
You don't need to pay to look,
you can decide later.

614
00:45:53,975 --> 00:45:56,671
There is no problem
in checking it out, right?

615
00:46:03,819 --> 00:46:05,411
This is perfect!

616
00:46:05,587 --> 00:46:08,454
Now we're talking..
This is amazing!

617
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:10,754
lmagine...

618
00:46:13,361 --> 00:46:14,885
Here, we'll have the reception...

619
00:46:15,263 --> 00:46:16,594
bay windows on both sides...

620
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,624
the rest we'll leave open...
sparse furniture...

621
00:46:20,268 --> 00:46:21,929
we'll use artificial grass
for the flooring...

622
00:46:22,871 --> 00:46:24,463
and on that wall a mounted TV.

623
00:46:24,973 --> 00:46:26,338
There we'll plonk our couch...

624
00:46:26,441 --> 00:46:28,602
Three seater...
For the important matches... finals.

625
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:30,334
As if it were a stadium.

626
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,505
A new millennium sophisticated shop.

627
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:36,749
Somebody speak to this Scrooge!

628
00:46:37,385 --> 00:46:39,683
We aren't opening a vegetable mart.

629
00:46:40,555 --> 00:46:42,318
Location is everything!

630
00:46:42,858 --> 00:46:45,349
We can't do one of those,
'buy one, get one cowshed free' deals.

631
00:46:46,528 --> 00:46:47,290
What are you doing?

632
00:46:48,797 --> 00:46:50,526
We don't have an option.

633
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,896
We can't afford the mortgage.

634
00:46:52,334 --> 00:46:55,497
We don't even have enough
to apply for a bank loan.

635
00:46:55,904 --> 00:46:57,599
Nobody's going to trust us
with such a big loan.

636
00:46:57,772 --> 00:46:59,296
You told me that we should
think everything through.

637
00:46:59,374 --> 00:47:00,306
That's what l'm doing.

638
00:47:01,643 --> 00:47:02,667
lt's not possible.

639
00:47:02,844 --> 00:47:03,833
Damn!

640
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,018
How much do we need
to show for the bank loan?

641
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,011
500,000.00

642
00:47:17,592 --> 00:47:18,752
You want me to ask uncle?

643
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,318
Have you lost it?

644
00:47:21,863 --> 00:47:23,490
A loan to get another loan?

645
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:27,692
Hello sir...

646
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:30,998
the window front shop?

647
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:35,301
Everybody wants a piece of that.

648
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:38,344
l'm with a client right now,

649
00:47:38,847 --> 00:47:40,678
call me in half.

650
00:47:44,019 --> 00:47:45,486
Tell him no, Hassan bhai.

651
00:47:46,421 --> 00:47:47,445
Tell him it's gone.

652
00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:51,952
Fantastic Govi!

653
00:47:52,027 --> 00:47:53,016
That's my man!!

654
00:47:53,628 --> 00:47:54,925
Wait a minute...

655
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:56,829
you have to convince your uncle.

656
00:47:56,898 --> 00:47:57,922
He will.

657
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,989
Will your uncle agree?

658
00:48:00,068 --> 00:48:01,695
Don't worry, l'll manage him.

659
00:48:09,578 --> 00:48:11,307
Not those books again!

660
00:48:11,613 --> 00:48:13,638
We'll go through them..in good time.

661
00:48:14,249 --> 00:48:15,307
Not now please...

662
00:48:21,723 --> 00:48:23,281
Finish your pizza,
it's getting late.

663
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:25,759
What's wrong?
Why are you in a hurry?

664
00:48:26,628 --> 00:48:29,358
Why do you keep running from me?
l don't bite...

665
00:48:30,732 --> 00:48:31,926
Why can't we be friends?

666
00:48:33,969 --> 00:48:34,936
The probability is minimum...

667
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,266
Why?

668
00:48:37,772 --> 00:48:38,636
What do you mean 'minimum'

669
00:48:38,974 --> 00:48:40,407
l want reasons.

670
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:44,034
l can give you four!

671
00:48:45,013 --> 00:48:46,446
One, l'm your teacher.

672
00:48:47,882 --> 00:48:49,747
Two, you are my best friend's sister.

673
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,916
Three, you are way younger than me.

674
00:48:55,824 --> 00:48:57,951
Four, and most important of all...

675
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,327
you are a girl.

676
00:48:59,961 --> 00:49:00,928
The magic of numbers!

677
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,628
lt never ceases to amaze!

678
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,694
l suggest...

679
00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:08,893
you should have a back-up friend...

680
00:49:09,471 --> 00:49:10,495
just in case.

681
00:49:10,805 --> 00:49:11,533
Back-up friend?

682
00:49:11,606 --> 00:49:12,368
Of course!

683
00:49:12,507 --> 00:49:14,771
l mean, lsh, Omi and you
have been close friends...

684
00:49:14,843 --> 00:49:16,276
like since you were sperm!

685
00:49:16,478 --> 00:49:19,936
What if you have a fall-out with them?
Then you might need a back-up friend.

686
00:49:20,282 --> 00:49:21,874
To share your feelings...

687
00:49:22,884 --> 00:49:24,249
Will you... share?

688
00:49:26,788 --> 00:49:29,382
Vidya, l want to expand this business,
no matter what it takes.

689
00:49:29,457 --> 00:49:31,755
By next year,
we have to buy a shop in the mall.

690
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,793
But the shop we liked is...

691
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:36,395
beyond our reach.

692
00:49:36,564 --> 00:49:38,361
lt's futile trying to
explain it to lsh and Omi.

693
00:49:40,502 --> 00:49:41,901
l don't know what's going to happen.

694
00:49:42,804 --> 00:49:44,635
Something will work out.

695
00:49:46,741 --> 00:49:48,868
Promise me the day you get the shop...

696
00:49:48,977 --> 00:49:50,706
you'll show it to me first.

697
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,443
Would you like something sweet now?.

698
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,915
His Highness bunked school today!

699
00:50:02,057 --> 00:50:06,460
With every passing day,
he is becoming more and more stubborn.

700
00:50:06,695 --> 00:50:09,789
You ran away from cricket practice?!
Now you're going to get it!

701
00:50:09,864 --> 00:50:11,422
He is just a kid, uncle.

702
00:50:11,499 --> 00:50:15,799
Schools can be quite a bore at his age.

703
00:50:16,037 --> 00:50:19,495
But he needs to focus
on one thing at least.

704
00:50:19,941 --> 00:50:21,772
What about cricket?

705
00:50:22,711 --> 00:50:24,508
ls he working hard at the nets?

706
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,304
He doesn't need to...

707
00:50:27,549 --> 00:50:29,380
he was born to play cricket.

708
00:50:29,584 --> 00:50:33,452
He can slam sixes and
fours with his eyes shut.

709
00:50:33,722 --> 00:50:36,384
The bowlers are terrified of him.

710
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,487
On the on-side, he plays like a god!

711
00:50:39,728 --> 00:50:42,390
His off-side is a little weak,
but we are working on that.

712
00:50:43,064 --> 00:50:46,693
You should come and
see him at the nets one day.

713
00:50:50,372 --> 00:50:51,464
Can l see him for a minute?

714
00:50:53,575 --> 00:50:54,564
Thank you!

715
00:51:11,893 --> 00:51:13,485
Ali?

716
00:51:16,297 --> 00:51:18,458
You still angry with me, Marble Champ?

717
00:51:20,402 --> 00:51:21,994
l'm sorry about that day.

718
00:51:24,005 --> 00:51:24,869
Ali...

719
00:51:26,674 --> 00:51:28,608
Ali...

720
00:52:21,629 --> 00:52:22,687
Hassan Sheikh?

721
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,999
Why go through him?

722
00:52:28,703 --> 00:52:32,434
There's that Kantilal Shah
on Satellite Road...

723
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,032
He'll be perfect.

724
00:52:37,879 --> 00:52:40,370
But Omi... the location of
our shop is amazing, isn't it?

725
00:52:40,482 --> 00:52:43,713
The bank has also done due diligence.
So why complicate matters...

726
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:44,046
But...

727
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:45,513
Convince your uncle.

728
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:50,389
How does it matter to him
whether we go with Mr. Sheikh or booty-shake?

729
00:52:51,092 --> 00:52:52,024
Okay.

730
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,356
Okay?

731
00:52:54,529 --> 00:52:57,020
Uncle, the location is amazing...

732
00:52:57,665 --> 00:52:59,098
and the bank has also done due diligence.

733
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:00,434
lt's really good.

734
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:04,304
As you wish, son...

735
00:53:04,873 --> 00:53:05,737
Vishwas!

736
00:53:29,631 --> 00:53:30,529
500,000.00

737
00:53:30,598 --> 00:53:32,293
Well done, my boy!

738
00:53:33,968 --> 00:53:35,333
Go ahead... count it...

739
00:53:35,403 --> 00:53:36,597
it is 500,000!

740
00:53:56,324 --> 00:53:59,418
lt's time to celebrate!

741
00:54:01,596 --> 00:54:04,463
Here, we'll have the reception...

742
00:54:04,999 --> 00:54:07,934
we'll use artificial grass
for the flooring...

743
00:54:08,269 --> 00:54:10,362
the rest we'll leave sparse...

744
00:54:11,372 --> 00:54:15,274
and a wall mounted TV over there.

745
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:19,644
Here we'll have a three seater couch...

746
00:54:19,847 --> 00:54:21,747
l'm thinking something like that...

747
00:54:21,983 --> 00:54:23,314
What do you think?

748
00:54:42,003 --> 00:54:43,903
Damn! The pages are stuck!

749
00:54:43,972 --> 00:54:45,405
Go to the next one.

750
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:49,999
Govi...

751
00:54:50,778 --> 00:54:51,836
take a look...

752
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,005
Come on!

753
00:54:53,414 --> 00:54:54,346
What?

754
00:55:35,757 --> 00:55:37,349
Sorry buddy, l'm getting
late for practice.

755
00:55:37,425 --> 00:55:38,983
You go ahead and watch it.

756
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,425
l have to go.

757
00:55:40,662 --> 00:55:43,062
Don't wander too much,
you might get lost.

758
00:55:43,831 --> 00:55:45,992
First check the field setting thoroughly.

759
00:55:46,367 --> 00:55:48,892
Vidya, l'm leaving for work.

760
00:55:49,604 --> 00:55:51,299
lt's all about timing.

761
00:55:51,939 --> 00:55:53,406
Look for the gap...

762
00:55:53,775 --> 00:55:55,902
and smash the ball
right through it!

763
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:29,642
Wait here.

764
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,921
That's the way!

765
00:56:58,506 --> 00:56:59,302
Now pull...

766
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:02,241
Come on, Omi... buck up!

767
00:57:03,745 --> 00:57:04,803
And cut it!

768
00:57:05,246 --> 00:57:08,647
Come on, Omi... you can do it!

769
00:57:16,657 --> 00:57:19,251
He's cut it.
That's how its done!

770
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,389
You lost to a 12 year old.

771
00:57:22,463 --> 00:57:23,828
Shame on you, Omi Shastri!

772
00:57:25,466 --> 00:57:26,763
Let's go for that one now.

773
00:57:26,968 --> 00:57:28,435
Whose team are you on?

774
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:30,965
You can't handle the string or what?

775
00:58:19,253 --> 00:58:20,242
Mom...

776
00:58:20,721 --> 00:58:21,745
Let's get out.

777
00:58:33,267 --> 00:58:34,962
- Where are you going?
- Go out in the open.

778
00:58:35,036 --> 00:58:36,594
l'll join you...

779
00:59:48,776 --> 00:59:50,676
Our shop...

780
00:59:53,648 --> 00:59:54,842
We've lost everything...

781
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:56,884
Get a grip, Govi.

782
00:59:59,553 --> 01:00:01,020
Come on, Govi...

783
01:01:04,644 --> 01:01:05,668
Brother...

784
01:01:13,453 --> 01:01:15,944
When will Naseer uncle
be back from Surat?

785
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:19,851
Can't get through to him,
the phone lines are all down.

786
01:01:20,327 --> 01:01:22,192
This place is not
safe for the children.

787
01:01:22,862 --> 01:01:24,295
How long can we go on like this?

788
01:01:31,671 --> 01:01:33,639
Everything will be alright.

789
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,740
There's no need to worry, okay?

790
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:42,247
The senior leaders of the party
are leaving for Bhuj...

791
01:01:42,382 --> 01:01:43,349
and l have tojoin them.

792
01:01:43,717 --> 01:01:44,911
- Vishwas...
- Yes!

793
01:01:45,185 --> 01:01:46,277
l want you to take charge here.

794
01:01:46,353 --> 01:01:47,911
- Don't worry!
- Omi!

795
01:01:48,221 --> 01:01:49,688
Omi, lend Vishwas a hand.

796
01:01:49,823 --> 01:01:52,155
- Okay?
- Yes, uncle.

797
01:01:52,592 --> 01:01:54,560
Let him be with you...

798
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:01,650
Sir, Juhapur has been razed to the ground.

799
01:03:01,728 --> 01:03:03,923
l've seen it,
there are cracks everywhere.

800
01:03:04,164 --> 01:03:05,597
Their building can collapse anytime...

801
01:03:05,665 --> 01:03:07,326
please let them stay
in this camp for a few days.

802
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,164
We need about 15-20 tags...

803
01:03:10,737 --> 01:03:11,931
where do we enroll?

804
01:03:12,305 --> 01:03:13,738
lsn't he Naseer's son?

805
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:15,640
Why?

806
01:03:15,842 --> 01:03:16,774
Where's his father?

807
01:03:17,243 --> 01:03:18,505
l don't see him...

808
01:03:18,678 --> 01:03:21,943
ln his campaign speech he claimed
he's here to serve the people...

809
01:03:22,415 --> 01:03:25,248
But now when they need him,
he decides to skip town?

810
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,109
Dude...

811
01:03:28,288 --> 01:03:29,312
what's he talking about?

812
01:03:29,522 --> 01:03:31,615
Give me the tags,
they are in deep trouble...

813
01:03:31,658 --> 01:03:33,182
we have to help them.

814
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:36,226
We're dealing with thousands
of homeless of our own...

815
01:03:36,329 --> 01:03:37,557
and the food coupons are limited.

816
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:38,426
Let me talk to him...

817
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:39,528
lshaan...

818
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:40,531
we need to talk.

819
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,589
What's there to talk?

820
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,566
Give me the tags first...

821
01:03:44,137 --> 01:03:45,399
we can talk later.

822
01:03:45,605 --> 01:03:47,402
They haven't eaten in two full days...

823
01:03:47,474 --> 01:03:49,533
Take them and go away.

824
01:03:49,676 --> 01:03:50,700
lshaan, listen to me...

825
01:03:50,777 --> 01:03:51,505
Enough is enough!

826
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:52,306
Move it!

827
01:03:53,713 --> 01:03:54,372
Move it!

828
01:03:54,447 --> 01:03:56,210
- lshaan...
- Tell your friend...

829
01:03:56,316 --> 01:03:57,510
to take those people and go away...

830
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:58,642
Leave!

831
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:07,148
Throw him out!

832
01:04:07,227 --> 01:04:08,353
You bloody jerk!

833
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:09,690
Throw him out!

834
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:11,492
Push them out!

835
01:04:12,665 --> 01:04:14,462
God knows where they've come from!

836
01:04:18,571 --> 01:04:20,471
Go stuff your tags!

837
01:04:22,409 --> 01:04:25,606
The situation is still dire
in the earthquake struck areas.

838
01:04:25,745 --> 01:04:27,474
Numerous buildings have collapsed...

839
01:04:27,547 --> 01:04:30,607
life has come to a stand still.

840
01:04:30,817 --> 01:04:32,114
According to the latest news...

841
01:04:32,185 --> 01:04:33,482
Govind!

842
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,451
Get up!

843
01:04:35,688 --> 01:04:37,417
lts time to think ahead now.

844
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,131
You alright, son?

845
01:04:51,438 --> 01:04:52,666
Hello, sir!

846
01:04:56,609 --> 01:04:58,270
You should never have taken them there.

847
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,580
lt was so humiliating!

848
01:05:03,249 --> 01:05:06,150
But sir, l only meant to help.

849
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,616
What good is your help?

850
01:05:07,921 --> 01:05:12,153
Everybody knows that Bittoo and his lackeys
will never help my people.

851
01:05:12,592 --> 01:05:14,253
All this 'community service' is ajoke!

852
01:05:14,561 --> 01:05:15,528
Enough of this sham!

853
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,687
lt's better that Ali stays
amongst his own people.

854
01:05:18,765 --> 01:05:21,233
We'll take care of him.
Thank you for your help.

855
01:05:29,275 --> 01:05:31,140
l've been calling you all day...

856
01:05:31,311 --> 01:05:33,142
you've turned the ringer off?

857
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,112
You still have fever?

858
01:05:45,892 --> 01:05:46,483
No!

859
01:05:47,227 --> 01:05:49,127
Then why don't you get off your bum?

860
01:05:50,597 --> 01:05:52,827
How long will you stay cooped up inside?

861
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:55,494
What do you want me to do?
Build a new mall?

862
01:05:58,605 --> 01:06:02,200
We'll do that too.
But first go and handle your friends...

863
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,303
they had a nasty fight in full public view.

864
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:06,569
What?

865
01:06:16,189 --> 01:06:17,486
Call me later, okay?

866
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:19,415
You take care.

867
01:06:19,459 --> 01:06:20,858
Yes, alright.

868
01:06:28,635 --> 01:06:29,727
Omi...

869
01:06:31,771 --> 01:06:33,864
you know lshaan has a short fuse...

870
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:35,437
you shouldn't take him seriously.

871
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:37,406
Don't tell me about lshaan.

872
01:06:38,678 --> 01:06:40,578
l know him a lot better than you.

873
01:06:41,814 --> 01:06:43,475
Of course, you do.

874
01:06:47,787 --> 01:06:49,516
Never mind...

875
01:06:51,624 --> 01:06:55,151
lshaan always loses it
at the drop of a hat, let it go.

876
01:06:55,228 --> 01:06:56,354
Why don't you let it go?

877
01:06:57,664 --> 01:07:00,633
You should have seen
the way he insulted me in full public.

878
01:07:02,368 --> 01:07:05,337
And all for that worthless kid.

879
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:09,730
lmagine...

880
01:07:10,543 --> 01:07:13,808
what he will do when
he learns about you and Vidya.

881
01:07:30,396 --> 01:07:33,490
lsh, the cash is missing.

882
01:07:34,701 --> 01:07:36,430
There was a bundle of 40,000 in here.

883
01:07:38,104 --> 01:07:39,093
Have you seen it?

884
01:07:48,448 --> 01:07:49,813
Let's report to the police.

885
01:07:49,882 --> 01:07:51,144
l...
l took the money.

886
01:07:52,852 --> 01:07:53,580
Come again?

887
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,344
l took the money.

888
01:07:57,557 --> 01:08:00,458
The past two days have been crazy,
there was no time to think.

889
01:08:00,526 --> 01:08:03,188
- l called you but you didn't answer...
- Where's the money?

890
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:05,595
Where is the money?

891
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,761
Ali's building needed repairs.

892
01:08:09,902 --> 01:08:11,460
l used it to pay for the repairs.

893
01:08:13,306 --> 01:08:15,331
All he cares for is that kid...

894
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:17,608
Now carry him on
your shoulders and dance.

895
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:18,842
Stay out of this!

896
01:08:18,911 --> 01:08:19,878
Why?

897
01:08:21,481 --> 01:08:22,470
Why?

898
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,274
Do you have any idea...

899
01:08:24,417 --> 01:08:26,578
how many of our own are
still buried under the rubble.

900
01:08:28,554 --> 01:08:30,715
We've been pulling out
their bodies day and night.

901
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:33,618
But none of it matters to you.

902
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,090
All you can think of is that boy
and his troubles.

903
01:08:36,129 --> 01:08:36,857
Not ours?

904
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:39,257
We are nothing to you, right?

905
01:08:39,465 --> 01:08:40,659
What are you talking about?

906
01:08:41,134 --> 01:08:42,192
Yours? Ours?

907
01:08:42,802 --> 01:08:44,565
Now you're talking like your uncle!

908
01:08:45,304 --> 01:08:48,102
l'm not ashamed of what l did.

909
01:08:48,174 --> 01:08:50,301
l'll do it again, if l have to.

910
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:54,108
lts only human to help
others in their time of need...

911
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:55,670
Are you their messiah?

912
01:08:55,848 --> 01:08:57,406
l told you to stay out!

913
01:08:57,483 --> 01:08:58,142
Shut up!

914
01:08:58,351 --> 01:08:59,409
Talk to me.

915
01:09:06,793 --> 01:09:08,351
Who are you?

916
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:12,163
Who do you think you are?
A hero?

917
01:09:13,533 --> 01:09:14,727
ls this your father's money?

918
01:09:14,801 --> 01:09:17,167
How could you take it,
you fucking asshole?

919
01:09:19,639 --> 01:09:20,765
Did you earn it?

920
01:09:23,309 --> 01:09:25,243
We are already buried
under uncle's debt.

921
01:09:29,649 --> 01:09:32,083
First the builder runs off with the money...

922
01:09:32,285 --> 01:09:33,752
then the mall gets razed...

923
01:09:34,821 --> 01:09:37,255
we owe Omi's uncle 500,000.

924
01:09:37,557 --> 01:09:40,082
500,000! Do you remember?

925
01:09:40,226 --> 01:09:44,162
You couldn't choose a better time
for your social work?

926
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:45,792
Go and get the money.

927
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,495
l want the money!

928
01:09:49,535 --> 01:09:51,093
The money has been spent...

929
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:53,634
there's nothing l can do.

930
01:09:55,875 --> 01:09:57,706
Think about it, Govi...

931
01:09:58,344 --> 01:10:00,244
Someone with Ali's talent,
comes once in a lifetime...

932
01:10:01,414 --> 01:10:03,814
and l won't let go of this chance.

933
01:10:04,851 --> 01:10:05,647
lt's only money!

934
01:10:05,718 --> 01:10:07,413
We can always earn more.

935
01:10:09,722 --> 01:10:10,848
Look at this.

936
01:10:11,524 --> 01:10:13,515
The lndia- Australia cricket series
is going to begin soon.

937
01:10:13,726 --> 01:10:15,250
Once lndia wins the series...

938
01:10:15,328 --> 01:10:18,593
business will boom overnight.

939
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:20,894
What?

940
01:10:23,669 --> 01:10:24,499
Leave...

941
01:10:25,171 --> 01:10:25,762
Govi, please...

942
01:10:25,905 --> 01:10:26,872
l said, leave!

943
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:27,834
Please hear me out...

944
01:10:27,874 --> 01:10:29,466
Get the hell out of here!

945
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:33,269
Why don't you take what's left!

946
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,527
Shastriji, please don't refuse again.

947
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,603
The minister himself wanted
to come meet you...

948
01:10:59,405 --> 01:11:02,863
but he had to rush to Gandhinagar
for something urgent.

949
01:11:02,942 --> 01:11:04,239
l thought...

950
01:11:04,377 --> 01:11:04,934
Bitoo...

951
01:11:07,313 --> 01:11:11,613
we are family and l don't like
to disappoint you every time.

952
01:11:11,784 --> 01:11:15,845
l'm a man of God.
Politics is not my cup of tea.

953
01:11:17,223 --> 01:11:20,954
Serving the people is merely
another way of serving God.

954
01:11:22,662 --> 01:11:25,392
Shashtriji, we've pinned our hopes on you.

955
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:27,730
Please think about it.

956
01:11:30,736 --> 01:11:33,500
Don't forget to take the temple offerings.

957
01:11:35,241 --> 01:11:36,173
Have a good day!

958
01:11:52,491 --> 01:11:54,186
Sir wants to see you now.

959
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:55,249
Come on.

960
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:01,894
Here's 20,000
we'll pay the rest in installments.

961
01:12:02,301 --> 01:12:06,203
Come back when you have the entire amount.

962
01:12:06,639 --> 01:12:09,335
We don't accept pittance out here.

963
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:11,699
Omi!

964
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:15,203
How's that friend of yours?

965
01:12:15,514 --> 01:12:16,947
Has he cooled down?

966
01:12:17,617 --> 01:12:18,743
Why don't you tell him...

967
01:12:19,719 --> 01:12:21,311
not to get into trouble...

968
01:12:24,724 --> 01:12:28,125
Uncle, you've always supported us.

969
01:12:28,828 --> 01:12:30,193
We need a little more time...

970
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:31,730
Forget about the money.

971
01:12:33,165 --> 01:12:36,191
The campaign begins next month...

972
01:12:36,369 --> 01:12:37,529
Omi...

973
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:39,137
you have to plunge into it this time.

974
01:12:39,171 --> 01:12:40,536
Don't worry about a thing, uncle.

975
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:41,900
Omi will be by your side.

976
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,333
l will manage the shop on my own.

977
01:12:45,511 --> 01:12:46,341
Fine!

978
01:12:52,752 --> 01:12:55,915
Govind, it's been a while
since l met lshaan.

979
01:12:56,155 --> 01:12:58,180
lt's been a while since he's met himself!

980
01:13:01,928 --> 01:13:03,589
Excuse me!

981
01:13:05,498 --> 01:13:07,864
l'm Mrs. Mehta and this is my grandson.

982
01:13:08,267 --> 01:13:09,700
He's been crying 'cricket' all day!

983
01:13:09,835 --> 01:13:12,633
l need to attend the prayer service...

984
01:13:13,172 --> 01:13:14,571
do you mind if he watches the match?

985
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,239
Not at all.

986
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:22,714
There's a bundle for every block.

987
01:13:22,915 --> 01:13:24,644
Take your respective bundles..

988
01:13:24,717 --> 01:13:26,617
by Wednesday the posters
should be all over!

989
01:13:27,253 --> 01:13:28,413
l don't want any excuses.

990
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:29,283
Omi...

991
01:13:29,355 --> 01:13:30,686
- Yes?
- You got a minute?

992
01:13:32,224 --> 01:13:33,213
Yes?

993
01:13:46,605 --> 01:13:47,162
Uncle...

994
01:13:47,239 --> 01:13:48,137
Omi...

995
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,766
it's yours.

996
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:53,508
You are a senior member of the party now.

997
01:13:53,746 --> 01:13:56,180
Time you gave your bike some rest.

998
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:58,580
Thank you!

999
01:13:59,151 --> 01:14:00,584
Let's go for a drive.

1000
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:18,735
So, looks like lndia is winning?!

1001
01:14:18,804 --> 01:14:20,669
Yeah, l mean...

1002
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,731
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1003
01:14:22,808 --> 01:14:24,173
lt's no problem.

1004
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:27,278
Let's go, we'll watch the rest at home.

1005
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,505
Do you want to buy something?

1006
01:14:29,648 --> 01:14:31,172
That's okay.

1007
01:14:32,485 --> 01:14:36,251
Well... do you supply sports equipment
to schools as well?

1008
01:14:36,455 --> 01:14:37,422
Schools...

1009
01:14:37,456 --> 01:14:39,219
Yes, of course we do!

1010
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:42,118
l'm the principal of
Kendriya Vidyalaya school...

1011
01:14:42,161 --> 01:14:43,185
Urvashi Mehta.

1012
01:14:43,362 --> 01:14:44,590
Just a second.

1013
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,130
Please sit.

1014
01:14:47,633 --> 01:14:49,533
l'm Govind.

1015
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,327
l run this shop.

1016
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:53,131
Thank you.

1017
01:14:53,272 --> 01:14:56,264
Apart from supplying equipment
we also provide coaching.

1018
01:14:56,509 --> 01:14:58,477
We also run a coaching academy.

1019
01:14:58,644 --> 01:15:00,202
Wonderful.

1020
01:15:00,279 --> 01:15:04,272
l've been trying to include Physical Education
in the curriculum for a while now.

1021
01:15:04,784 --> 01:15:08,220
Why don't you come in
for a presentation?

1022
01:15:08,454 --> 01:15:09,546
For sure, ma'am!

1023
01:15:09,622 --> 01:15:11,249
Monday, 9 o'clock.

1024
01:15:11,657 --> 01:15:12,646
Let's go.

1025
01:15:12,725 --> 01:15:14,158
- Kendriya Vidyalaya school?
- Yes.

1026
01:15:14,193 --> 01:15:15,182
Okay.

1027
01:15:16,896 --> 01:15:18,659
Suketu...

1028
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:20,197
Thank you.

1029
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:21,559
Thank you.

1030
01:15:23,169 --> 01:15:24,568
l can't make it.

1031
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:29,332
On Monday, lndia plays their 2nd innings,
l'm staying at home.

1032
01:15:30,543 --> 01:15:33,307
Schedule it for another day, please...

1033
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,848
or manage it on your own.

1034
01:15:39,318 --> 01:15:41,218
Due to a fantastic spell by Harbhajan...

1035
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:43,585
Australia end the day at 291 for 8.

1036
01:15:43,756 --> 01:15:44,586
At the end of day 1...

1037
01:15:44,657 --> 01:15:46,352
it looks like even-stevens.

1038
01:15:46,692 --> 01:15:48,592
lndia has wrested the initiative back.

1039
01:15:49,328 --> 01:15:51,262
What do l do with lsh?

1040
01:15:51,864 --> 01:15:53,627
First, he took all that money
without saying a word...

1041
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:56,167
Then he fought with Omi...

1042
01:15:58,237 --> 01:16:01,206
He doesn't want
to accept responsibility at all...

1043
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,405
l don't know how your
family puts up with him...

1044
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:12,140
l agree my brother is impulsive...

1045
01:16:12,284 --> 01:16:14,377
but his friends mean the world to him.

1046
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:16,587
He doesn't sit around judging them.

1047
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:19,655
He will do anything for his friends.

1048
01:16:20,226 --> 01:16:21,659
Don't you think so?

1049
01:16:22,194 --> 01:16:23,718
Don't you?

1050
01:16:26,732 --> 01:16:29,166
Anyway, try these dumplings.

1051
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:30,700
l make them quite well.

1052
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:33,498
Come on.

1053
01:16:47,153 --> 01:16:48,780
Brother, l want to talk to you...

1054
01:16:51,157 --> 01:16:53,751
Later.

1055
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:01,424
Can't you spare two minutes to talk to me?

1056
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,759
l said, later.

1057
01:17:03,836 --> 01:17:04,860
Go away!

1058
01:17:05,671 --> 01:17:06,763
You go away!

1059
01:17:07,139 --> 01:17:08,766
You can't boss around all the time.

1060
01:17:08,841 --> 01:17:10,331
This is my home too.

1061
01:17:11,443 --> 01:17:12,205
Vidya.

1062
01:17:12,511 --> 01:17:13,307
Hand over the remote...

1063
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:15,578
Hand over the remote...

1064
01:17:15,648 --> 01:17:16,376
No.

1065
01:17:16,849 --> 01:17:18,146
or you will be sorry!

1066
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:21,520
Shameless!

1067
01:17:21,687 --> 01:17:23,154
Raising your hand on your sister?

1068
01:17:23,255 --> 01:17:27,692
Why don't you go face the world...
instead of bullying your own family.

1069
01:17:29,428 --> 01:17:32,124
l'm grateful your mother
is not alive...

1070
01:17:32,631 --> 01:17:35,225
to see this.

1071
01:17:39,505 --> 01:17:42,599
So, lndia's 1st innings
has folded up for 171...

1072
01:17:42,675 --> 01:17:46,406
274 runs short of Australia's 445.

1073
01:17:46,478 --> 01:17:48,537
Australia has enforced a follow-on.

1074
01:17:48,614 --> 01:17:51,139
lt's going to be uphill from here
to save the test match.

1075
01:17:52,218 --> 01:17:55,119
Aren't you done sulking yet?

1076
01:17:58,190 --> 01:18:00,818
Why don't you go talk to Omi?

1077
01:18:08,567 --> 01:18:12,833
He adores you so much,
much more than me.

1078
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,131
Again you've given up?

1079
01:18:18,577 --> 01:18:20,204
What happens to you?

1080
01:18:20,679 --> 01:18:23,807
One little thing doesn't go your way
and you give up!

1081
01:18:26,518 --> 01:18:28,110
Come on, brother.

1082
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:32,781
So generous with your temper but such a
miser when it comes to apologising.

1083
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:37,425
Just say sorry like you mean it.

1084
01:18:37,596 --> 01:18:38,790
He'll come around...

1085
01:18:40,266 --> 01:18:41,699
he is your fan.

1086
01:18:43,602 --> 01:18:45,502
We all are your fans.

1087
01:18:51,377 --> 01:18:52,366
Sorry, Vidya.

1088
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:06,223
- Sorry.
- lt's okay.

1089
01:19:09,228 --> 01:19:10,195
Listen...

1090
01:19:10,429 --> 01:19:11,794
distribute the sweets.

1091
01:19:17,703 --> 01:19:18,533
l'm sorry, man.

1092
01:19:20,639 --> 01:19:21,833
Omi...

1093
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:24,434
Please listen to me...

1094
01:19:25,377 --> 01:19:26,469
l'm sorry.

1095
01:19:26,779 --> 01:19:27,677
What do you want me to do?

1096
01:19:27,746 --> 01:19:28,542
Touch your feet?

1097
01:19:28,614 --> 01:19:29,774
What are you doing?

1098
01:19:30,082 --> 01:19:31,140
Have you lost it?

1099
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:34,111
l'm seeking forgiveness
for my sins, Oh Lord.

1100
01:19:34,153 --> 01:19:36,121
That's the queue for sinners.

1101
01:19:38,557 --> 01:19:39,683
Omi, come on...

1102
01:19:39,825 --> 01:19:40,792
Am l not a brother to you?

1103
01:19:42,261 --> 01:19:44,126
l'm sorry.

1104
01:19:49,134 --> 01:19:50,761
You don't care for anybody but yourself.

1105
01:20:01,313 --> 01:20:07,684
On this occasion the Australians have been
bettered by VV S Laxman, 275 not out.

1106
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:12,186
And tremendous assistance from
Rahul Dravid, 155 not out.

1107
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:16,661
And not one wicket has been added
to that last column in today's play.

1108
01:20:16,762 --> 01:20:19,629
lt's been a magnificent day for lndia.

1109
01:20:19,698 --> 01:20:21,529
Fantastic batting by the two.

1110
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,864
They've showed a real mature head
on those young shoulders.

1111
01:20:24,136 --> 01:20:26,434
The Australians could not
claim a single wicket all day.

1112
01:20:26,505 --> 01:20:30,134
At the end of day 4,
lndia stands at 589 for 4.

1113
01:20:30,376 --> 01:20:31,809
Yes, that's it.

1114
01:20:32,311 --> 01:20:34,575
At last they've decided that
they've had enough.

1115
01:20:34,813 --> 01:20:36,872
The news has just come in
from the dressing room.

1116
01:20:37,149 --> 01:20:38,241
lt is confirmed.

1117
01:20:38,317 --> 01:20:41,753
Ganguly has decided to
declare the innings at 658.

1118
01:20:42,287 --> 01:20:44,881
They've set Australia
a daunting target of 384 to win.

1119
01:20:45,491 --> 01:20:46,924
lt's a challenging declaration.

1120
01:20:47,192 --> 01:20:48,750
The match has come back to life.

1121
01:20:49,328 --> 01:20:51,694
At least a draw is assured.

1122
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:54,665
Ganguly shouldn't have declared the innings.
The players were on a roll.

1123
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:56,826
What if Australia manages
to get the runs?

1124
01:20:56,902 --> 01:20:58,563
And what if we manage
to get all 10 wickets?

1125
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:02,332
No team has ever won
from a follow-on position.

1126
01:21:02,541 --> 01:21:03,838
What say, Govind?

1127
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:06,777
lt looks difficult.

1128
01:21:07,179 --> 01:21:09,613
ln the last 100 years,
it has only happened twice.

1129
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:10,880
lt will end in a draw.

1130
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:12,678
Screw your statistics...

1131
01:21:12,751 --> 01:21:14,218
Our players morale is running high...

1132
01:21:14,353 --> 01:21:16,617
besides... anything's possible in cricket.

1133
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,518
The game is on, boss!

1134
01:21:23,695 --> 01:21:25,526
Australia have lost their 1st wicket.

1135
01:21:28,901 --> 01:21:30,528
And it's a big shout and he's out!

1136
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:35,162
1st ball, 1st innings.
1st ball, 2nd innings.

1137
01:21:35,841 --> 01:21:38,173
And Adam Gilchrist goes.

1138
01:21:38,544 --> 01:21:41,513
Rapped on the pads and
the finger has gone up.

1139
01:21:45,517 --> 01:21:46,779
Come on!

1140
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:54,891
lt's the last wicket...

1141
01:21:55,894 --> 01:21:56,918
nobody moves.

1142
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,524
He's given him out.

1143
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:04,200
Yes!!

1144
01:22:04,269 --> 01:22:05,167
We've done it!

1145
01:22:05,204 --> 01:22:06,466
That's the end of the test match.

1146
01:22:06,538 --> 01:22:07,664
lndia has won.

1147
01:22:07,739 --> 01:22:10,435
lndia has won in dramatic style.

1148
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:13,740
Everyone is on their feet.

1149
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:16,280
The series has been leveled.

1150
01:22:16,315 --> 01:22:17,475
Wow! What a victory.

1151
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:24,319
The 3rd team in 1535 test matches
to win a test after following on.

1152
01:22:24,389 --> 01:22:26,584
And a significant victory too.

1153
01:22:48,146 --> 01:22:49,272
Really missed you, man.

1154
01:23:07,599 --> 01:23:10,625
Hang on!
One by one!

1155
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:19,904
Omi...

1156
01:23:21,813 --> 01:23:22,802
Omi...

1157
01:23:31,123 --> 01:23:32,215
Okay, guys!

1158
01:23:32,558 --> 01:23:33,820
lmportant announcement!

1159
01:23:34,359 --> 01:23:36,190
The inter club tournament is coming up!

1160
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:39,822
This year Sabarmati Sports Club
is going to participate.

1161
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,368
Jigla, you'll be the captain.

1162
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:46,503
Ali and Ashwin will open the batting.

1163
01:23:47,172 --> 01:23:48,434
So, get set boys!

1164
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:51,709
Son, this is a government aided school.

1165
01:23:51,877 --> 01:23:55,608
What matters most is that
the students clear their examinations.

1166
01:23:55,681 --> 01:24:01,677
To allocate 40,000
every month on sports training...

1167
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:03,580
doesn't make sense.

1168
01:24:03,655 --> 01:24:05,816
Sir, these are basic figures.

1169
01:24:05,891 --> 01:24:07,256
We can work it out.

1170
01:24:07,326 --> 01:24:08,486
No, we cannot.

1171
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:09,920
Do you know what you're saying?

1172
01:24:10,529 --> 01:24:12,190
There are more than 1000 students.

1173
01:24:12,264 --> 01:24:13,458
How can we charge
less than this?

1174
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:15,463
Moreover, we're throwing
in the equipment for free.

1175
01:24:16,268 --> 01:24:17,200
Sorry, sir.

1176
01:24:17,269 --> 01:24:18,497
lt's not practical for us
to charge less...

1177
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:19,628
we'll go into losses.

1178
01:24:20,505 --> 01:24:21,597
lshaan, think about it.

1179
01:24:21,673 --> 01:24:23,641
They don't even have sports in their syllabus.

1180
01:24:23,675 --> 01:24:26,166
Name one thing from our syllabus
that we've actually used in life?

1181
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,838
With better scores they can
secure admission in a good university.

1182
01:24:30,215 --> 01:24:34,242
Sports alone can't help
children secure their future.

1183
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:36,681
lt's not fair.

1184
01:24:36,755 --> 01:24:38,882
You cannot compare the two, ma'am.

1185
01:24:39,224 --> 01:24:41,249
Sports training is
not limited to the sports field.

1186
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:42,793
Students learn valuable life skills.

1187
01:24:43,195 --> 01:24:44,787
Teamwork, focus, self discipline...

1188
01:24:44,863 --> 01:24:46,387
Students learn to push themselves...

1189
01:24:46,465 --> 01:24:48,160
they are able to set a definite goal.

1190
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:50,894
Finally, they are able to fend for
themselves in the real world.

1191
01:24:51,603 --> 01:24:56,165
Winning the 100 metres hurdles is no less
an achievement than scoring 100 in Physics.

1192
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:04,440
You were fabulous.

1193
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:06,583
For a minute,
l thought we had lost the deal.

1194
01:25:06,618 --> 01:25:09,416
Did you see the look
on Mrs. Srivastava's face?

1195
01:25:09,788 --> 01:25:13,849
We should offer this training package
to all the schools in Ahmedabad.

1196
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:15,421
ln fact, not just Ahmedabad...

1197
01:25:15,494 --> 01:25:17,257
Surat, Baroda, Rajkot...

1198
01:25:17,396 --> 01:25:20,456
Soon, Sabarmati Sports Club branches
will sprout all over the country.

1199
01:25:20,666 --> 01:25:22,759
So many schools... so many children...

1200
01:25:22,834 --> 01:25:24,392
can you imagine the talent?

1201
01:25:24,569 --> 01:25:26,366
We'll get them from every nook and cranny...

1202
01:25:27,272 --> 01:25:29,638
See how your business takes off!

1203
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:30,504
Just like you say.

1204
01:25:30,575 --> 01:25:32,167
Of course!

1205
01:25:32,344 --> 01:25:34,312
l'll become Ambani and
we'll make Omi the Chief Minister.

1206
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:36,674
But for now, let's get a rickshaw.

1207
01:25:39,584 --> 01:25:44,851
Hello everyone and welcome to a bright
and sunny day here at the Ahmedabad cricket ground...

1208
01:25:45,123 --> 01:25:47,182
to witness this exciting match between...

1209
01:25:47,259 --> 01:25:50,126
Raipur Chakla and Sabarmati Sports Club.

1210
01:25:56,201 --> 01:25:57,225
Sorry, got caught up.

1211
01:25:57,302 --> 01:25:59,133
l just closed the shop.

1212
01:25:59,705 --> 01:26:00,763
Omi?

1213
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,771
He's been out since 7 in the morning.

1214
01:26:03,275 --> 01:26:04,640
Busy with the campaigning.

1215
01:26:07,345 --> 01:26:12,305
Vote for the Yagna symbol.

1216
01:26:13,318 --> 01:26:17,755
Vote for Bittoo Joshi...

1217
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:40,207
l've told him a million times.
But he just doesn't get it.

1218
01:26:42,547 --> 01:26:44,208
Hit that to the offside.

1219
01:26:44,583 --> 01:26:45,641
Relax, lsh.

1220
01:26:45,717 --> 01:26:46,809
He is doing well.

1221
01:26:47,519 --> 01:26:48,816
Let him play his natural game.

1222
01:26:49,254 --> 01:26:50,653
You can't always play by the book.

1223
01:26:52,557 --> 01:26:54,491
You used to innovate all the time.

1224
01:26:54,693 --> 01:26:55,523
Are you done?

1225
01:26:55,694 --> 01:26:57,628
Let him enjoy.

1226
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:09,129
And that's a lovely square cut
by Ali Hashmi...

1227
01:27:09,207 --> 01:27:11,175
and it goes to
the backward point boundary.

1228
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:20,383
We are witnessing an amazing display of
stroke play all round the ground.

1229
01:27:24,456 --> 01:27:28,688
Vote for the Yagna symbol.

1230
01:27:37,736 --> 01:27:39,636
Superb!

1231
01:27:42,808 --> 01:27:45,208
Hail Lord Krishna.

1232
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:07,495
A huge six to bring up his half century!

1233
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:12,860
He has broken an 18 year old record here by
smashing his 50 in 26 deliveries.

1234
01:28:13,505 --> 01:28:15,530
lt was not the easiest wicket
to bat on, Aditya.

1235
01:28:15,607 --> 01:28:17,802
And it comes as a little bit of a surprise
to me that...

1236
01:28:17,876 --> 01:28:21,334
this boy had a strike rate of
almost 200 through his innings.

1237
01:28:21,479 --> 01:28:24,312
Sabarmati Sports Club have
sailed through to the next round.

1238
01:28:30,589 --> 01:28:32,557
And he comes charging down and this is it!

1239
01:28:32,591 --> 01:28:34,081
He has hit it out of the park.

1240
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:37,486
Sabarmati Sports Club
has won this tournament.

1241
01:28:41,099 --> 01:28:42,191
Yeah!

1242
01:28:59,217 --> 01:29:06,123
Who doesn't know the loyal servant
of the people, Subodh Mehta.

1243
01:29:06,324 --> 01:29:11,318
l request him to come up and
say a few lines.

1244
01:29:14,399 --> 01:29:20,269
Brothers, let's not forget the path...

1245
01:29:20,472 --> 01:29:24,533
that Gandhiji has shown us.

1246
01:29:24,709 --> 01:29:29,237
OThe Mahatma was the true
son of this soil...

1247
01:29:31,349 --> 01:29:34,580
Vote for Bittoo Joshi!

1248
01:29:55,573 --> 01:29:58,440
People say...

1249
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:02,542
Gujaratis are gutless...

1250
01:30:03,214 --> 01:30:04,772
They can't stand for their right!

1251
01:30:04,849 --> 01:30:06,840
l challenge each and everyone of them...

1252
01:30:07,118 --> 01:30:08,312
let's meet on the battle field!

1253
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:19,280
Couldn't you pick another route?

1254
01:31:19,691 --> 01:31:21,716
This is a shortcut.

1255
01:31:22,527 --> 01:31:23,516
Omi...

1256
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:25,957
Calm down!

1257
01:31:26,865 --> 01:31:29,561
We've lost the battle
but not the war!

1258
01:31:33,838 --> 01:31:35,169
Now come on, get on with it!

1259
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:36,172
Okay sir.

1260
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:54,269
Govi...

1261
01:34:57,909 --> 01:35:01,401
Let bygones be bygones.

1262
01:35:01,879 --> 01:35:05,713
We may have lost the constituency
but the entire state is with us.

1263
01:35:06,918 --> 01:35:09,580
Next week we begin our 'Saffron Rally'.

1264
01:35:09,887 --> 01:35:11,855
The party high command has decided that...

1265
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:18,854
at least one member of every Hindu family
will go on a pilgrimage to Ayodhya.

1266
01:35:23,368 --> 01:35:25,666
About 200 party members
reside in this district.

1267
01:35:25,737 --> 01:35:26,431
How many?

1268
01:35:26,537 --> 01:35:27,731
200!

1269
01:35:28,406 --> 01:35:30,704
Each of you has to enroll
at least 20 people.

1270
01:35:31,409 --> 01:35:32,637
Start the campaign today itself.

1271
01:35:33,111 --> 01:35:36,308
Go all out,
no one should be left behind.

1272
01:35:42,287 --> 01:35:43,117
Omi...

1273
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:47,715
Reserve a ticket for your mom and dad.

1274
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:50,188
You are going to be a part
of something historical...

1275
01:35:50,361 --> 01:35:51,794
they should be there to support you.

1276
01:35:52,697 --> 01:35:53,561
Keep it up.

1277
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:09,541
You've hit the big time, Omi!

1278
01:36:10,648 --> 01:36:11,580
Wow.

1279
01:36:12,483 --> 01:36:13,450
What's up?

1280
01:36:16,254 --> 01:36:18,552
Looks like my academy
will finally see the light of day!

1281
01:36:19,757 --> 01:36:24,717
But what good is the academy
if you keep missing important matches?

1282
01:36:25,396 --> 01:36:27,296
Ali scored his first century!

1283
01:36:27,465 --> 01:36:29,865
Everybody went wild cheering for him.
You should've been there.

1284
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:32,700
Our Ali has turned into a star overnight.

1285
01:36:37,241 --> 01:36:38,731
So tell me...

1286
01:36:39,844 --> 01:36:40,833
How are things at the shop?

1287
01:36:41,112 --> 01:36:42,136
How do you think?

1288
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:44,575
l'm tired of working with that Scrooge!

1289
01:36:45,149 --> 01:36:46,275
You think it's funny?

1290
01:36:46,451 --> 01:36:48,112
He bores the hell out of me.

1291
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:49,648
l can't handle him on my own.

1292
01:36:49,721 --> 01:36:50,847
When are you coming back?

1293
01:36:51,122 --> 01:36:52,214
Tell me...

1294
01:36:52,323 --> 01:36:53,790
l miss you.

1295
01:36:54,759 --> 01:36:55,623
Sorry bro...

1296
01:36:56,594 --> 01:36:58,562
l've been neck deep in
organising this pilgrimage...

1297
01:36:59,364 --> 01:37:00,592
l have to coordinate a million things.

1298
01:37:01,432 --> 01:37:02,364
l have a lot to do.

1299
01:37:03,601 --> 01:37:04,397
Are you going as well?

1300
01:37:04,469 --> 01:37:05,629
Have to...

1301
01:37:06,704 --> 01:37:08,365
but l'll join them later...

1302
01:37:08,439 --> 01:37:09,701
someone has to stay back.

1303
01:37:11,175 --> 01:37:12,540
That's right.

1304
01:37:15,313 --> 01:37:16,405
Will you come along?

1305
01:37:19,684 --> 01:37:21,481
l'll go wherever you send me.

1306
01:37:43,708 --> 01:37:45,403
Keep the tickets safely.

1307
01:37:45,810 --> 01:37:47,573
Call me once you get there.

1308
01:37:48,679 --> 01:37:50,442
You take care.

1309
01:38:08,433 --> 01:38:09,695
Father...

1310
01:38:11,169 --> 01:38:13,262
l know you are not happy about going...

1311
01:38:13,771 --> 01:38:16,137
but without your blessings...

1312
01:38:17,542 --> 01:38:18,770
l can't move ahead in life.

1313
01:38:33,558 --> 01:38:34,422
Omi...

1314
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:22,700
What do you mean... 'missed them'?

1315
01:39:24,408 --> 01:39:25,397
What do you mean by that?

1316
01:39:26,611 --> 01:39:29,171
l'm four days late,
it's never happened before.

1317
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,312
l clearly remember we used protection...

1318
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:39,322
Everything's not a math equation.

1319
01:39:39,357 --> 01:39:40,551
Softly please.

1320
01:39:50,668 --> 01:39:51,566
Yes, lshaan...

1321
01:39:51,636 --> 01:39:53,103
The supplier is here...

1322
01:39:53,304 --> 01:39:55,431
he is asking for 38,000, should l pay him?

1323
01:39:55,506 --> 01:39:56,131
No!

1324
01:39:56,173 --> 01:39:58,403
Pay only 20 percent as advance,
not a rupee more.

1325
01:39:59,277 --> 01:40:01,142
Driver, stop!

1326
01:40:01,212 --> 01:40:02,236
Keep going!

1327
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:04,646
Hello.

1328
01:40:05,449 --> 01:40:06,245
Sorry.

1329
01:40:06,884 --> 01:40:09,648
l'll figure the rest when l get there.

1330
01:40:09,787 --> 01:40:11,254
Where are you?

1331
01:40:11,322 --> 01:40:12,346
l'm stuck in traffic.

1332
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:14,220
l'll see you soon.
Okay, bye!

1333
01:40:18,663 --> 01:40:20,130
l'm sorry, Vidya.

1334
01:40:20,331 --> 01:40:21,593
lt's the first time for me too,
try to understand.

1335
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:23,327
l am sorry too...

1336
01:40:24,468 --> 01:40:25,457
but what else can l do...

1337
01:40:26,704 --> 01:40:29,468
l can't share this with anyone else.

1338
01:40:31,442 --> 01:40:34,172
Sorry... l'm driving you crazy, no?

1339
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,144
Don't worry, l'm with you.

1340
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,379
What are you looking at?

1341
01:40:56,667 --> 01:40:58,157
Don't worry at all.

1342
01:40:58,502 --> 01:41:00,697
You're in great form!

1343
01:41:00,905 --> 01:41:02,770
We'll crack the selection tomorrow.

1344
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:05,434
Go home and rest now.

1345
01:41:18,389 --> 01:41:19,447
Hello uncle...

1346
01:41:19,790 --> 01:41:22,224
Yes... l'm heading to
the railway station, why?

1347
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:24,887
Sabarmati Express...

1348
01:41:26,263 --> 01:41:27,457
coach S-6...

1349
01:41:27,632 --> 01:41:29,463
l am sure about it, it is S-6...

1350
01:41:31,602 --> 01:41:32,762
Okay, l'll be there.

1351
01:41:35,406 --> 01:41:36,805
Back to the party office.

1352
01:41:40,311 --> 01:41:44,179
We've received information that
the train with Hindu devotees...

1353
01:41:44,215 --> 01:41:47,207
arriving from Ayodhya was halted
at Godhra station at 8 am.

1354
01:41:47,385 --> 01:41:49,478
And two compartments were set on fire.

1355
01:41:49,587 --> 01:41:52,852
ln this brutal act, many children, women
and old people were burnt alive...

1356
01:42:00,898 --> 01:42:02,729
Uncle, l want to go there.

1357
01:42:07,705 --> 01:42:09,570
There's nothing left there, Omi.

1358
01:42:13,411 --> 01:42:14,776
Brace yourself...

1359
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:19,546
Trust me...

1360
01:42:21,819 --> 01:42:23,650
We won't spare them.

1361
01:42:27,158 --> 01:42:27,817
Let's go.

1362
01:42:31,362 --> 01:42:32,260
Got through?

1363
01:42:33,297 --> 01:42:34,423
Can't get through...

1364
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:36,698
Keep calling.

1365
01:42:38,803 --> 01:42:41,601
lt's time to go to war.

1366
01:42:43,774 --> 01:42:51,146
Those bastards think that
us vegetarian Hindus are impotent.

1367
01:42:52,817 --> 01:42:54,910
They have gone too far this time.

1368
01:42:55,853 --> 01:43:02,452
We'll teach them a lesson that
generations will remember for ages to come.

1369
01:43:03,427 --> 01:43:06,453
More than 40 women
and children burnt alive...

1370
01:43:08,432 --> 01:43:12,391
My own sister was burnt alive...

1371
01:43:13,804 --> 01:43:15,863
Their bare bones have turned to ash.

1372
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:29,715
Let's go home, Omi...

1373
01:43:35,159 --> 01:43:35,853
Omi...

1374
01:43:40,531 --> 01:43:42,294
There's going to be trouble...

1375
01:43:42,733 --> 01:43:43,791
Let's go home.

1376
01:43:51,408 --> 01:43:53,342
Did your mother die?

1377
01:43:59,216 --> 01:44:00,205
Omi...

1378
01:44:11,662 --> 01:44:13,152
Omi listen...

1379
01:44:13,731 --> 01:44:15,722
Let's go home.

1380
01:44:26,177 --> 01:44:27,508
Let him be.

1381
01:44:29,613 --> 01:44:31,706
Now is not the time to cower and hide...

1382
01:44:32,616 --> 01:44:33,776
You boys run home.

1383
01:44:33,851 --> 01:44:34,783
Sir, a few minutes--

1384
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:36,114
l said go home.

1385
01:44:37,421 --> 01:44:38,820
Let's go.

1386
01:45:07,585 --> 01:45:10,486
Hail Lord Ram...
(chanting)

1387
01:45:11,755 --> 01:45:17,352
Hail Lord Ram...

1388
01:45:30,341 --> 01:45:31,103
You get off here.

1389
01:45:31,442 --> 01:45:32,272
l'll go get Ali.

1390
01:45:33,143 --> 01:45:34,474
Have you lost your mind?

1391
01:45:34,612 --> 01:45:35,544
Things are really tense out there.

1392
01:45:35,613 --> 01:45:38,707
Tomorrow is an important day for him,
his selection's coming up.

1393
01:45:39,116 --> 01:45:40,174
You go.

1394
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:41,309
l'll call when l get home.

1395
01:45:41,385 --> 01:45:42,215
Go home.

1396
01:45:45,155 --> 01:45:46,144
lsh, don't.

1397
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:51,160
No calls are going through...

1398
01:45:51,195 --> 01:45:53,425
can't reach the collector nor the police...

1399
01:45:55,666 --> 01:45:57,657
Mr. Mehta is also out of town...

1400
01:45:58,836 --> 01:46:01,168
he won't be back before tomorrow.

1401
01:46:03,207 --> 01:46:04,469
Hello...

1402
01:46:05,643 --> 01:46:07,133
l'm here to take Ali with me.

1403
01:46:07,177 --> 01:46:09,873
Not today, lshaan.

1404
01:46:10,681 --> 01:46:12,205
lt's not safe outside.

1405
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:13,682
Things could get ugly out there.

1406
01:46:13,751 --> 01:46:15,582
You should leave.

1407
01:46:16,854 --> 01:46:18,822
Altaf, get the boys ready.

1408
01:46:21,625 --> 01:46:22,751
Uncle...

1409
01:46:23,761 --> 01:46:25,228
l will stay with Ali.

1410
01:46:25,296 --> 01:46:28,129
When you are done,
you and Ali come with me.

1411
01:46:28,399 --> 01:46:29,661
You'll be safe.

1412
01:46:34,505 --> 01:46:35,529
And what about them?

1413
01:46:38,242 --> 01:46:39,334
Where will they go?

1414
01:46:55,259 --> 01:46:56,817
'City tense. Stay safe. - V'

1415
01:47:01,598 --> 01:47:03,259
'l'm home. Got the report?'

1416
01:47:11,909 --> 01:47:14,275
'Not yet. That tension is even bigger.
Love. - V'

1417
01:47:22,553 --> 01:47:23,815
lsh! Are you back home?

1418
01:47:24,655 --> 01:47:27,146
No... l'm still here.

1419
01:47:27,391 --> 01:47:29,188
What the hell!
Leave immediately!

1420
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:30,327
l don't know what to do.

1421
01:47:30,494 --> 01:47:33,395
There is no one home...

1422
01:47:33,464 --> 01:47:34,795
Ali is alone here.

1423
01:47:36,133 --> 01:47:37,122
Listen...

1424
01:47:38,202 --> 01:47:39,430
can you come here?

1425
01:47:39,770 --> 01:47:41,465
l'm a little... scared...

1426
01:47:43,407 --> 01:47:44,533
l'll see you in ten!

1427
01:48:31,088 --> 01:48:32,851
Brother, move the kids inside.

1428
01:48:34,658 --> 01:48:36,523
Khurshid... wait.

1429
01:48:46,136 --> 01:48:47,398
Thank God you're here.

1430
01:48:50,707 --> 01:48:52,140
What's the situation like?

1431
01:48:53,143 --> 01:48:54,440
lt's bloody tense.

1432
01:48:55,412 --> 01:48:57,676
People are up in arms.

1433
01:48:58,348 --> 01:49:00,282
And they are out for blood!

1434
01:49:01,852 --> 01:49:05,117
l'm afraid its going to get worse,
it's not safe to leave now.

1435
01:49:05,155 --> 01:49:06,452
But...

1436
01:49:10,227 --> 01:49:13,287
Hail Lord Ram!

1437
01:49:42,126 --> 01:49:44,617
Hail Lord Ram...

1438
01:49:48,499 --> 01:49:50,126
Step outside...

1439
01:49:50,367 --> 01:49:52,232
you cowards!

1440
01:49:52,536 --> 01:49:55,471
Stop hiding behind your women!

1441
01:49:56,640 --> 01:50:00,406
Let's talk about this calmly...

1442
01:50:00,577 --> 01:50:02,807
going for each other's throat
makes no sense.

1443
01:50:06,316 --> 01:50:09,308
Break the door!
Set them on fire!

1444
01:50:09,419 --> 01:50:12,354
lt's time to avenge the killing
of our mothers and sisters!

1445
01:50:12,422 --> 01:50:14,617
Hail Lord Ram...
(chanting)

1446
01:50:14,691 --> 01:50:16,556
At least fear God...

1447
01:50:18,562 --> 01:50:19,551
There are women and children here.

1448
01:52:42,372 --> 01:52:43,532
Uncle...

1449
01:52:46,143 --> 01:52:47,167
Uncle...

1450
01:52:48,879 --> 01:52:49,641
Got through?

1451
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:50,612
No.

1452
01:52:53,383 --> 01:52:55,146
Open the door!

1453
01:52:59,690 --> 01:53:02,750
They're killing mercilessly...

1454
01:53:02,826 --> 01:53:04,259
lshaan...

1455
01:53:04,361 --> 01:53:06,386
Help us...

1456
01:53:06,463 --> 01:53:10,923
They will kill us,
please help!

1457
01:53:11,268 --> 01:53:13,828
You'll be fine!
Trust me!

1458
01:53:13,904 --> 01:53:16,634
They'll kill us all.

1459
01:53:16,707 --> 01:53:20,199
Do something, please!

1460
01:53:45,569 --> 01:53:48,629
Here, keep my phone,
don't come out until l call.

1461
01:53:58,915 --> 01:54:00,143
Got through?

1462
01:54:00,183 --> 01:54:01,514
Can't even get through to the cops.

1463
01:54:01,585 --> 01:54:02,552
Give it to me.

1464
01:54:21,538 --> 01:54:24,507
Thank God! Govi,
l was so scared--

1465
01:54:24,908 --> 01:54:25,806
Vidya...

1466
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:28,099
Brother...

1467
01:54:29,212 --> 01:54:30,372
Govi?

1468
01:54:33,116 --> 01:54:36,142
lsh... let me explain.

1469
01:54:37,754 --> 01:54:39,187
Son-of-a-bitch!

1470
01:54:39,489 --> 01:54:40,456
How dare you!

1471
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:52,361
Omi...

1472
01:54:53,670 --> 01:54:56,400
Listen to me for a minute, Omi...

1473
01:54:57,607 --> 01:55:00,371
There's no one here,
they're all gone.

1474
01:55:11,521 --> 01:55:12,488
Not there, Omi...

1475
01:55:12,556 --> 01:55:13,818
Not there.

1476
01:56:55,859 --> 01:56:57,850
Brother...

1477
01:57:00,864 --> 01:57:02,456
lsh...

1478
01:57:03,533 --> 01:57:05,125
lshaan...

1479
01:58:08,565 --> 01:58:10,294
You ok?

1480
01:58:26,516 --> 01:58:28,416
Good catch in the outfield and...

1481
01:58:28,485 --> 01:58:30,646
the crowd goes jubilant
and why wouldn't they?

1482
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:33,086
Australia finishing then at 278.
2 wickets for lndia.

1483
01:58:33,123 --> 01:58:35,455
That last over definitely belonged
to lndia, Ajay.

1484
01:58:36,092 --> 01:58:38,492
You've got to say that Gaurav,
that last over did belong to lndia...

1485
01:58:38,561 --> 01:58:42,190
but somewhere along the line,
278 against Australia...

1486
01:58:42,332 --> 01:58:44,129
is going to be tough.

1487
01:58:44,334 --> 01:58:46,700
The last over was good...
but tempted to say...

1488
01:58:46,770 --> 01:58:48,135
Too little too late'.

1489
01:58:48,204 --> 01:58:50,536
You keep talking about this wicket
and you have been...

1490
01:58:50,607 --> 01:58:53,804
it's really playing to Australia's strengths,
isn't it, to their bowlers' strengths?

1491
01:58:54,177 --> 01:58:54,871
lt does.

1492
01:58:55,145 --> 01:58:57,306
You know, it's a rare wicket that
you see in lndia.

1493
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:59,473
Such a seaming track,
you don't see so much of grass.

1494
01:58:59,549 --> 01:59:03,508
This is something that is going to assist
Australian bowlers a lot more than lndian bowlers.

1495
01:59:08,825 --> 01:59:09,849
Omi...

1496
01:59:13,697 --> 01:59:14,629
lshaan.

1497
01:59:32,849 --> 01:59:34,510
This is your uncle Omi.

1498
02:00:03,113 --> 02:00:04,808
The Australian fielders out in the field...

1499
02:00:04,881 --> 02:00:07,179
you can see that body language
and looking confident...

1500
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:09,250
lndia's got the batting, we know that...

1501
02:00:09,419 --> 02:00:12,877
but tricky, as we keep saying,
on this pitch...

1502
02:00:13,156 --> 02:00:17,456
278 is probably 350 on any other
batting wicket in lndia.

1503
02:00:34,577 --> 02:00:37,239
Ajay, what must be going
through the youngster's head?

1504
02:00:37,714 --> 02:00:42,344
lt's a good place to be, Gaurav, because
this is what you work for all your life.

1505
02:00:42,485 --> 02:00:46,683
The last 10 years of his life, he's spent on
that ground training, morning-evening.

1506
02:00:46,756 --> 02:00:48,417
Trying to play different shots.

1507
02:00:48,491 --> 02:00:50,618
And this is the place where he was,
you know, practicing for.

1508
02:00:50,693 --> 02:00:52,183
You were telling us about Ali Hashmi...

1509
02:00:52,262 --> 02:00:53,923
you've seen him play at the domestic circuit.

1510
02:00:54,197 --> 02:00:55,858
l'm quite excited to
see him play at this level...

1511
02:00:55,932 --> 02:00:58,400
because l've seen him play at
the state level, as you said.

1512
02:00:58,468 --> 02:01:01,335
He's done exceptionally well there.
This is a different stage.

1513
02:01:01,404 --> 02:01:04,737
But l personally believe,
he's got it in him to do it at this stage.

1514
02:01:13,483 --> 02:01:17,283
First ball of the lndian innings and
Ali Hashmi, the debutant is on strike.

1515
02:01:47,283 --> 02:01:51,413
What a fantastic shot!
That exquisite cover-drive.

1516
02:01:51,454 --> 02:01:53,786
Four runs... nobody moved for that one.

1517
02:01:53,890 --> 02:01:55,858
And Ali Hashmi is off the mark.

1518
02:01:56,159 --> 02:01:58,923
He certainly is, Gaurav
and what a way to get off the mark.

1519
02:01:59,162 --> 02:02:02,427
l mean, to start his international career
with that shot.

1520
02:02:02,565 --> 02:02:04,556
lt's just pure class that you saw.

1521
02:02:04,701 --> 02:02:06,726
lt just doesn't get any better.
