1
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:44,559
Mumbai! You must have heard of it

2
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:49,299
It is said, If someone comes here once, belongs to here only

3
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:56,325
And there is a reason to live is it's crowd, rush and it's dazzle

4
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:04,159
Here there is money, power, glamour, sex, scandal and an unknown glow

5
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:09,472
And among all of this is our Bollywood
Indian Film industry"

6
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:16,718
Every year abundance of boys and girls comes to Mumbai from
the various parts of the country to try their luck

7
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:22,530
The dazzle of films, the stardom of superstars
Crazy fans and inflow of money

8
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,220
These things magnetize them and bring them here

9
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:30,263
Though they come with flock of dreams in their heart

10
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:35,181
But here they face the bitter truth of the glamour world

11
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:39,114
"What you see is sold"
You must have heard of it

12
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:44,677
But have you ever seen the struggle behind what you sees and what is sold?

13
00:02:44,677 --> 00:02:47,343
Their pain, their woe and their hopes

14
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:53,410
Every morning they get ready, they go to one office to another office for the audition

15
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,047
They get extremely negative response from everywhere

16
00:02:57,047 --> 00:03:02,124
Then manage their courage and prepare for the another audition

17
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:06,254
Return back to home in evening with broken dreams

18
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:09,821
Drink cheap alcohol and abuse everyone

19
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:12,476
Mourn over your own poverty

20
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:15,580
Next morning, wake up with a new dream

21
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,857
To get ready with the same spirit

22
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:22,665
A desire in heart and being passionate to prove yourself best from others

23
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:25,967
Knowingly that what will I get to eat at night

24
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:32,303
The story is about those few people
who reached their destiny with lot of difficulties

25
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,142
And now the award for the best debut director

26
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:58,332
And the award goes to

27
00:03:58,332 --> 00:03:59,795
Mr. Shyam Kapoor

28
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:28,012
That's great. Congratulations

29
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:30,012
-Thank you Sir
-And you achieved

30
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:35,530
Sir, I couldn't speak to you in front of people

31
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,132
That's why I came here to meet you

32
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:41,297
It is your right and I knew that Veer would get the award for the best actor

33
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:43,442
Congratulations again and keep it up

34
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:45,028
Thank you sir

35
00:05:45,904 --> 00:05:48,738
But you are the rightful owner of this, sir

36
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:54,582
If you hadn't given me the break then I wouldn't be here today

37
00:05:55,521 --> 00:06:00,000
I was just a struggler. A struggler

38
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,529
The sword I see, whether it is for practice or show

39
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,220
Sometimes it takes the form of the accident

40
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,235
Accidents never informs before coming

41
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:30,321
Only a right attack is enough to inform about the accident

42
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:34,947
Cut it... That's great.. Amazing

43
00:06:34,947 --> 00:06:38,325
Sir, you gave the wonderful shot. Amazing

44
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:41,570
Very nice. Mind blowing

45
00:06:41,883 --> 00:06:44,579
Please come, sir. Let me show you the shot

46
00:06:56,597 --> 00:06:59,611
Brother, give me this chair. You sit here

47
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:00,909
Take this chair

48
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:05,541
Director's guests has arrived. Give me the chair otherwise he will get angry on me

49
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:09,897
Give it. Move aside. Every struggler needs a chair

50
00:07:35,684 --> 00:07:38,180
Brother, are you deaf? I asked for tea

51
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,880
I will get it. Why are you getting angry?

52
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:43,690
He is calling me deaf! Don't know from where these strugglers comes

53
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,857
Come here. What did you say?

54
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,736
Nothing

55
00:07:47,736 --> 00:07:50,090
-What is it?
-Hey, what is it?

56
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,415
Hey what's your problem? Are you a superstar? Sit down quietly

57
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:56,618
And you go and do your work

58
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,688
Just go away

59
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:05,444
I have an advice for you that you must leave the acting

60
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,401
What do you mean? Should I leave the film industry, sir?

61
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:11,004
No, I am not asking you to leave the film industry

62
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:14,554
I am asking you to leave acting because your body is not flexible

63
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:17,043
You don't give proper expressions.

64
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:19,623
You look fighter more than an actor

65
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:23,340
So do one thing, join a fight master's group

66
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:26,265
One day you will definitely become a fight master

67
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,834
All the production teams are same everywhere

68
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,338
Forget it. The time is not yet ours

69
00:08:36,338 --> 00:08:39,629
-Will you have tea?
-Yes

70
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,317
Where is sugar kept?

71
00:08:51,135 --> 00:08:53,390
Sanyam, I gave you the money for sugar?

72
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,930
I spent that money

73
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:57,201
-Scoundrel
-Akshay, please

74
00:08:57,514 --> 00:08:59,707
Samrat, you have pampered him

75
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,868
He has taken money from me too

76
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:06,452
He is our friend. When he will get the money, he will pay back.
Don't worry my friend.

77
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:19,360
-I want to go in to give an audition
-The audition is over

78
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:31,160
There is ruckus everywhere
It's drama on screen

79
00:09:32,224 --> 00:09:39,607
This is the testimony
of the film strugglers

80
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:46,040
There is ruckus everywhere
It's drama on screen

81
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,564
This is the testimony
of the film strugglers

82
00:09:52,564 --> 00:09:57,318
Life is full of poverty

83
00:09:57,318 --> 00:10:06,203
Everyone is scared

84
00:10:06,203 --> 00:10:10,581
What everyone calls
Luck is very inferior

85
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:17,263
Everyone is scared

86
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:18,869
-Veer
-Hello

87
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,791
-And he is Samrat.
-Shreshth, I am a drama artist.

88
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:22,440
Yes

89
00:10:29,051 --> 00:10:32,959
What happened that you called up? You wanted to meet urgently.

90
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:35,451
How do I say, I live as a paying guest

91
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:38,860
The owner has a personal problem. He is asking me to leave.

92
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,091
Where do I move in so quickly?

93
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:43,407
Doesn't matter. You can join us dude.

94
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:46,646
-Yes, join us.
-Thank you

95
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,883
Give an audition everyday
for different productions

96
00:10:55,883 --> 00:10:58,761
Sometimes you are
selected or rejected

97
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:00,880
The situation is grave

98
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,200
Some say he is smart
and some call him stupid

99
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,891
To move on they have to
take up any role

100
00:11:09,891 --> 00:11:14,144
Talent is misused
You lose your mind

101
00:11:14,144 --> 00:11:19,087
Caught for metoo
that's the breaking news

102
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:23,342
What an unfortunate moment

103
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:31,853
Everyone is scared

104
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:36,326
What everyone calls
Luck is very inferior

105
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:44,077
Everyone is scared

106
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:49,146
Dude, they don't want to give any job. They why do they take the auditions?

107
00:11:49,146 --> 00:11:54,344
Dude, they talk so high but their character is very low. For no reason.

108
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:58,689
Forget it dude. Everyone is making fool here.

109
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:07,397
Everyone is scared

110
00:12:07,397 --> 00:12:12,280
What everyone calls
Luck is inferior

111
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:23,241
Everyone is scared

112
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:27,014
-Give me one tea.
-Ok, sir

113
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:42,284
In our industry, every third person is making fool of other two persons.

114
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:47,548
Everyone is playing games with each other.

115
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:52,131
They talk great things

116
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,442
Pimps are better than these people

117
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,984
At least they have some morals

118
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:04,307
These people have no morals at all

119
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:10,102
Film industry is a family! What family? My foot

120
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,651
-Stop it
-What happened? Why are you getting angry?

121
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:54,201
If you want to dance naked. Go outside

122
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,927
Naked? Who is naked?

123
00:13:56,177 --> 00:13:59,620
Turn back and look at yourself. Your undie is torn.

124
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:02,793
What?

125
00:14:06,173 --> 00:14:11,277
Hey, don't laugh

126
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:24,420
I don't like to wear torn undies. I am helpless

127
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:31,720
Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you

128
00:14:44,437 --> 00:14:49,836
Take this money and buy whatever you want to buy

129
00:14:49,836 --> 00:14:54,280
Veer, please give me Rs.500. I want to repair my phone

130
00:14:58,152 --> 00:15:04,640
This is all I have. I have to buy a shirt tomorrow.
I got a role and I have wear my own clothes

131
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,189
-It's okay. I will get it repair later on. Work is more important.
-Yes

132
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:30,376
-Excuse me
-Yes

133
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:32,722
-Can you do me a favour please!
-Yes

134
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:38,962
Actually I am shopping for my dad. Can you please hold this shirt for me?

135
00:15:38,962 --> 00:15:42,840
-Yes, sure
- I'll just take a few pictures. I need to send it to my dad.

136
00:15:43,654 --> 00:15:46,699
Yes...great

137
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:51,849
Hey, why are you standing with an ugly face? You have such a cute face. Smile!

138
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:56,524
Great....fabulous

139
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:00,494
-Actually, It's a surprise for my dad.
-Okay

140
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:01,617
I am gifting him.

141
00:16:01,617 --> 00:16:06,632
By the way, If you send these pictures to dad won't the surprise get revealed?

142
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,888
Oh! you are so intelligent. You are such a genius

143
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:12,832
I didn't think about this. Actually I am just kidding.

144
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,957
Actually, there is no secret between me and my dad. Nothing is hidden

145
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:19,011
-We both are totally crazy.
-Okay

146
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:21,696
-One more please!
-Okay

147
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:25,094
Thank you so much. You are doing such a huge favour on me

148
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:29,560
Smile.... Yeah

149
00:16:30,998 --> 00:16:36,521
-Hey, I have seen you somewhere. You are an actor. You are a TV guy.
-Yes

150
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:44,245
You have done one episode where you enacted a cop
and running after a serial rapist

151
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:48,534
Somewhere he was ahead of you and you were after him.
Somewhere you were ahead and he was following you

152
00:16:48,534 --> 00:16:52,589
I was such a hilarious chase scene. I must say.

153
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:57,568
It was me and that scene was serious not funny

154
00:16:57,568 --> 00:17:01,366
Really, but I feel that you are the funniest cop on this earth

155
00:17:02,305 --> 00:17:05,136
-Anyway, thank you
-Okay, thank you

156
00:17:05,386 --> 00:17:06,389
Can we have a cup of coffee?

157
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:35,503
Veer, you were suppose to go for the shooting today?

158
00:17:35,503 --> 00:17:39,400
Well, that role wasn't good. So I didn't take it up

159
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:47,638
-Hello
-Hi, good afternoon. Are you busy?

160
00:17:48,076 --> 00:17:53,868
No...yes.. I just return after giving a shot. I am free for some time

161
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,107
Okay, how long will you take to be free?

162
00:17:58,107 --> 00:18:00,480
-What's the matter?
-Please tell me

163
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:03,374
I will get free by 5 pm to 6 pm

164
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:09,269
So, the other day you paid for the coffee. Today, I will pay.
So, shall we meet exactly at 7 pm?

165
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:28,240
Allow me to show you my love

166
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,282
The experience should be new

167
00:18:32,282 --> 00:18:36,205
It should be candid

168
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:43,801
Gather me up so much so there is no complaint

169
00:18:43,801 --> 00:19:00,000
Allow me to show you my love

170
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:26,440
Let's forget everything and look up to each other

171
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:34,263
We are two bodies and one soul
this is what our heart desires

172
00:19:34,263 --> 00:19:41,300
Moisten the barren land by dropping like rain

173
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:49,266
Fulfil your desires so your absence is filled

174
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:57,940
Gather me up so much so there is no complaint

175
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:08,265
What is this? Give me the full amount

176
00:20:08,265 --> 00:20:12,084
Either pay the full rent or vacate the room

177
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:14,800
You promised me since three months

178
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,196
I will pay today...tomorrow. What is this?

179
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:23,854
Ajju brother take this amount for now, please.

180
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,320
Soon I will pay the rest of the amount, It's my request

181
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:33,834
That's why I don't rent my to actors.
All of them are broke

182
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,745
Please, for this time only

183
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,537
When will you the rest of the amount?

184
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,620
I will pay on 15th

185
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:53,440
Remember if you can't arrange on the 15th then pack your luggage

186
00:20:54,567 --> 00:21:00,440
Dude, please tell your friend. I am getting complaints about him

187
00:21:00,753 --> 00:21:06,200
He flirts with the lady next door. If any incident takes place!

188
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:09,890
Let me tell you I can't help you. Do you understand?

189
00:21:22,596 --> 00:21:30,384
You haven't paid since six months.
Because of you he gave us all piece of his mind

190
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,059
What do you think? is this your house?

191
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:40,446
You will stay here for free and flirt with the neighbourhood ladies

192
00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:43,074
-Hey
-Why? Does it hurt you?

193
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,679
Don't you feel anything when you live on my expenses?

194
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,127
Don't cross your limit or

195
00:21:48,127 --> 00:21:54,200
I will. What will you do? Will you hit me?
Will you? Get out of here

196
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:58,640
Don't shout. I am leaving. I don't want to stay here.

197
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,173
When I get the money, I'll throw it on your face.
I have that much courage.

198
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:06,864
Showing me attitude of money all the time.

199
00:22:13,189 --> 00:22:21,632
Sanyam, try to understand. Our situation is such that
we remove our frustration on others

200
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,600
Forget your anger

201
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:27,781
Dude, such small fights happens among friends

202
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:30,657
Don't leave. Please stay back, Sanyam

203
00:22:34,722 --> 00:22:39,280
Where are you going? You don't have anyone in this city?
Where will you stay?

204
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,971
Don't try to pacify me. I will stay anywhere but won't return to you.

205
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:01,682
Take this

206
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,320
-How much is left?
-I have some

207
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,072
I had kept it here only

208
00:23:20,072 --> 00:23:23,023
Brother, Coffee. Give me a cigarette

209
00:23:24,463 --> 00:23:30,639
Take this

210
00:23:51,355 --> 00:23:57,557
Sanyam, he likes you. You have a shelter for tonight.

211
00:23:58,308 --> 00:24:01,087
It's an opportunity, take it.

212
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:15,258
After all, work is work. Try to understand the work.
And this is role is good.

213
00:24:16,698 --> 00:24:19,450
Also you will get cash and that's the benefit.

214
00:24:19,888 --> 00:24:23,603
Mr. Tripathi, thank you for thinking of us.

215
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:28,656
Give us a lead role if you can. We have stopped working as character artist.

216
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:33,160
How long will we do the character roles?
Sir, give us an opportunity too?

217
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:37,266
Look right now I have this role only

218
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,540
Samrat, I was happy to see your confidence today

219
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:45,000
-It's good you refused the role.
-It was important to refuse him.

220
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:50,005
How long will we live a helpless life? There is no profit in it.

221
00:24:50,381 --> 00:24:53,640
We must do something huge now

222
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,882
Good, I am proud of you

223
00:24:56,445 --> 00:24:58,615
Now, let's start a new today

224
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,429
May I come in ma'am?

225
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:23,467
-Samrat, I am an artist
-Sit

226
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,353
Yes, tell me

227
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:38,974
Ma'am, I have come to you to find a job. If any of your project will begin then

228
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,955
Yes, there is one project. Just have a look

229
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:13,835
We took auditions of many boys but no one was shortlisted.
So we are just looking for somebody for the lead

230
00:26:14,336 --> 00:26:15,970
I don't understand anything

231
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:22,930
I am tired of doing small characters. I came here to became a hero

232
00:26:23,368 --> 00:26:28,685
I am tired of my failure and Infirmity

233
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:33,250
You know what, I have an idea. Let me talk to my dad

234
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:38,518
I am sure he will produce a film if I ask him to and you can do the lead role

235
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:41,630
So now cheer up, yes

236
00:26:56,276 --> 00:26:59,520
-Yes, Amit
-Akshay, I have a message for you

237
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,149
Om Sai Production is making a film. The audition is going on

238
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:07,876
You go and check. May be you will get lucky.
I will forward the address.

239
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,726
Okay, I will leave right away

240
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,801
Hey, go back

241
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:19,415
Pack up

242
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,920
-I want to give an audition.
-Stop him

243
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,920
-Sir, please give me a chance. I can prove myself
-Come here, let me check

244
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:43,800
Action

245
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,473
He will be our hero

246
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:08,735
Sir, It is my pleasure.
I am getting the project to work with you

247
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:15,400
It is the history of our production house.
We gave breaks to many new boys

248
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,492
Currently they all are stars

249
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,574
This production company is 50 years old and it is still on the top of the list.

250
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:50,141
Actually, the hero we waited for he was rightly chosen
Or we wouldn't get a hero like you

251
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,995
-And so how's the script?
-It is very good

252
00:29:55,934 --> 00:29:59,117
And are you satisfied with the character?

253
00:29:59,117 --> 00:30:02,807
-Yes, I am
-Okay, then shake hands

254
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:10,146
-So you are the hero of our film. The hero of "Intense Move"
-Thanks

255
00:30:32,204 --> 00:30:35,046
Hello, May I come in?

256
00:30:35,046 --> 00:30:37,359
Hello, Welcome!

257
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:41,600
Hi Sir! Hello. I missed you

258
00:30:43,165 --> 00:30:45,000
-Meet Mr. Akshay
-Akshay

259
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,436
He is the hero

260
00:30:46,436 --> 00:30:49,795
-Hi
-Wow, I heard about you from Sir

261
00:30:49,795 --> 00:30:52,070
-Glad to meet you
-Me too. Please sit

262
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:55,336
-We are very happy to have you here, Megha
-Really?

263
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,542
-Our hero is a black belt holder
-Oh really!... Wow

264
00:31:16,436 --> 00:31:20,000
This film industry is a circle

265
00:31:20,626 --> 00:31:25,437
People meet, Build up relationships.
They work in the same film too.

266
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:32,539
And when time changes, you know they meet
as they don't know each other

267
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:36,356
You are a star now. Will you forget me after this film?

268
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,547
That's not possible

269
00:31:38,547 --> 00:31:41,924
-Promise?
-Promise

270
00:31:41,924 --> 00:31:44,229
-Okay, bye
-Bye

271
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:55,372
See you, bye

272
00:32:51,484 --> 00:32:54,894
-Hey, Janvi
-Hey, Dad

273
00:32:54,894 --> 00:32:56,287
-How are you?
-Waiting for you

274
00:32:56,287 --> 00:32:57,216
Love you

275
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:01,081
Come, I want you to meet somebody

276
00:33:01,081 --> 00:33:02,624
-Oh, Sure
-Hello, sir

277
00:33:02,624 --> 00:33:04,082
-You spoke about him right?
-Yes

278
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,082
Yes, sit down please

279
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,255
-Look Mr
-Veer

280
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:18,010
Oh yes, Mr. Veer. I am a businessman

281
00:33:19,137 --> 00:33:25,809
I feel it's foolish to invest in a filed which I had no idea about

282
00:33:26,122 --> 00:33:27,594
But what to do?

283
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:33,760
My daughter decided to make a film then I will go for it.
I can't refuse her.

284
00:33:34,449 --> 00:33:39,930
Mr. Veer, I will talk to my financial advisor and I will get back to you.
Okay

285
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,369
-Great
-Okay - Happy?

286
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:42,800
-Thank you dad
-Love you dear

287
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,014
Love you so much

288
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:34,282
Samrat, do you know? When I read your script.
It is such a lovely script that I like it instantly

289
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:37,210
And your character is great

290
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,981
Good Morning!

291
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:16,894
What happened? Is there a problem?

292
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,905
Nothing much

293
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:23,353
What's wrong? Are you tensed?

294
00:35:32,448 --> 00:35:34,568
Are you in a bad mood today?

295
00:35:38,977 --> 00:35:41,303
You woke up early today

296
00:35:43,994 --> 00:35:45,337
Got to go now

297
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,158
Listen. I gave my mobile for repair.
Get it when you return home.

298
00:35:51,158 --> 00:35:52,712
The money is in the drawer. Take it.

299
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,051
I will get it repaired.

300
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,478
One more thing, while returning collect my cheque
from Mr. Shukla. Okay?

301
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:04,240
Okay

302
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:10,874
And come to office on time. Okay?
If you don't come, everything gets messy.

303
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:43,232
-The climate is so glorious
-Yes

304
00:36:48,078 --> 00:36:51,741
-Happy, you go ahead. I will just come. Okay?
-Okay

305
00:36:55,809 --> 00:36:58,686
Hi Sanyam, Where are you these days?

306
00:36:58,686 --> 00:37:00,000
I am good at the place I am at

307
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:05,200
-How are you?
-I am better than what I was there

308
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:09,951
I understood that seeing you.
But what are you doing these days?

309
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:11,480
I am enjoying.

310
00:37:11,793 --> 00:37:15,287
Dude, I am asking you about your work?

311
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:19,984
-I don't need to work. I am getting everything.
-Oh

312
00:37:21,736 --> 00:37:24,932
Sanyam If you don't mind, can I say something to you?

313
00:37:24,932 --> 00:37:29,405
Let it be. Don't give me the lecture. Bye

314
00:37:29,734 --> 00:37:30,765
Bye

315
00:37:49,307 --> 00:37:50,368
Hello, mom

316
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:55,497
Samrat, enough is enough.
My problems are increasing day by day

317
00:37:56,999 --> 00:38:00,334
I want to talk to you. Come home.

318
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,574
Forget about films.

319
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:07,076
Mom, don't say this all the time.

320
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,432
Whenever you call up I become nervous.

321
00:38:10,995 --> 00:38:16,957
Listen mom, I have signed one film.
Soon, everything will be fine.

322
00:38:18,334 --> 00:38:22,760
Mom, I am in a hurry. I'll talk to you later.

323
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:28,949
-Uncle, what's going on? Please give a cup of tea.
-Hey, Shyam

324
00:38:29,325 --> 00:38:32,201
-How are you?
-He does it daily

325
00:38:32,201 --> 00:38:35,676
-Hello! -Chhotu, get some tea
-Yes, sir. I will get it.

326
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,648
-Shyam, he is Veer. He is a good actor.
-Okay

327
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:46,263
Veer, he is Shyam. He is a writer and director.
He's an intelligent person.

328
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:47,884
Hello, sir

329
00:38:47,884 --> 00:38:50,204
Patel, why are you making fun of me?

330
00:38:51,255 --> 00:38:58,886
I am not an intelligent guy. If I was, I would have written, shoot and released few films.

331
00:38:58,886 --> 00:39:01,012
I wouldn't be sitting with you all.

332
00:39:01,388 --> 00:39:05,939
Shyam, please don't say that.
Note down, one day you will succeed.

333
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:17,035
-Samrat, how are you?
-Vivek, how are you?

334
00:39:17,035 --> 00:39:20,455
I am fine. Tell me about yourself.
Have you started on a new project?

335
00:39:20,455 --> 00:39:24,444
I am associated with a production company.
They will launch me as a lead hero.

336
00:39:24,444 --> 00:39:26,571
-That's great. Congratulations
-Thank you

337
00:39:26,884 --> 00:39:30,978
-Samrat, is there any new projects?
-Why?

338
00:39:30,978 --> 00:39:33,068
There is a requirement for an investor.

339
00:39:33,569 --> 00:39:37,222
Currently, I can't think of anything.
I will definitely tell you if there is something.

340
00:39:37,222 --> 00:39:40,067
-I am in a hurry at this moment. Let's meet again.
-Sure

341
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:41,850
-Right? Bye
-We shall meet soon. Bye

342
00:39:49,676 --> 00:39:57,314
You are such a scoundrel. Two projects are ready.
You will also be benefited.

343
00:39:57,627 --> 00:40:03,115
You will get two films as a hero.
Why are you thinking so hard? Use your mind.

344
00:40:03,678 --> 00:40:07,117
Fix a meeting. Talk to them and take things ahead.

345
00:40:07,868 --> 00:40:11,440
-Okay
-Okay. I will speak to them.

346
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:22,521
They want to be hero. Scoundrels

347
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,142
-Mr. Sharma?
-Are you Samrat?

348
00:40:37,142 --> 00:40:39,736
-Hi
-Hello! Rehana Ma'am

349
00:40:39,736 --> 00:40:41,330
-Hi
-Hello, nice meeting you - Hello

350
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,080
Welcome

351
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,567
Oh baby! you did a very good job

352
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:13,657
Do you know Mr. Sharma is ready to invest

353
00:41:13,657 --> 00:41:16,924
Now we will do Sharma's first first and then "Intense Move"

354
00:41:16,924 --> 00:41:20,095
-Are you happy now, baby?
-Yes

355
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:24,180
Oh my darling baby

356
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:09,401
Listen to your heart and speed in
Take it up to love your dreams

357
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:15,692
I started moving on with an objective

358
00:42:18,258 --> 00:42:22,636
There is a fire in my heart

359
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:27,840
My sealed lips spoke a lot

360
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:33,910
This disease grew in my body

361
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:38,760
It's moving

362
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,705
Love became a habit and started moving

363
00:42:44,705 --> 00:42:49,280
It's moving

364
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:55,337
Love became a habit and started moving

365
00:42:55,337 --> 00:43:00,663
You fly like a bird

366
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:32,415
Our love is complete now

367
00:43:32,415 --> 00:43:43,189
That's what my heart said

368
00:43:43,189 --> 00:43:48,506
All our nights are so dreamy

369
00:43:48,506 --> 00:43:58,821
So have my eyes witness them

370
00:43:59,259 --> 00:44:04,628
I kept moving because of you

371
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:09,382
Your joy was felt by me

372
00:44:10,008 --> 00:44:15,000
My sealed lips spoke a lot

373
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,960
This disease grew in my body

374
00:44:20,586 --> 00:44:25,320
It's moving

375
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:31,263
Love became a habit and started moving

376
00:44:31,263 --> 00:44:36,000
It's moving

377
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,256
Love became a habit and started moving

378
00:44:42,256 --> 00:44:47,081
You fly like a bird

379
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:50,272
Listen to your heart and speed up

380
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:52,880
Take it up to love your dream

381
00:45:02,081 --> 00:45:03,356
Mom is calling up

382
00:45:08,926 --> 00:45:14,602
I've been noticing, your are not receiving your mom's call

383
00:45:15,478 --> 00:45:18,975
What problem do you have?
Why don't you speak to her?

384
00:45:19,288 --> 00:45:23,345
What do I tell her? I can't answer her

385
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:27,404
There are many problems in the family. They need money.

386
00:45:28,632 --> 00:45:33,305
You know we don't have enough money for food.

387
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,326
How many family members you have?

388
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:44,030
Me, Mom and an elder sister

389
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,463
What about your dad?

390
00:45:46,715 --> 00:45:52,640
He left for another woman when I was five year old

391
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:59,496
He never cared about us. Neither mom nor family.

392
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,720
But mom worked hard to keep us happy.

393
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:07,660
She is tired fighting with life.

394
00:46:09,037 --> 00:46:12,477
Her son is not her support yet.

395
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:15,598
Shame on me.

396
00:46:15,598 --> 00:46:18,388
But Samrat, you are doing two films.

397
00:46:18,388 --> 00:46:20,857
You must have got some signing amount, right?

398
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,651
I didn't get anything yet.

399
00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:26,416
I am bearing Rehana's tantrum for a better future.

400
00:46:27,355 --> 00:46:29,066
I am her puppet.

401
00:46:33,009 --> 00:46:37,574
Work at office during the day and at night warm her bed.

402
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,548
Today is a special day for me.

403
00:47:10,548 --> 00:47:15,990
I am going to work with the director with which others dreams of working with.

404
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,763
I have an appointment with him.

405
00:47:18,763 --> 00:47:21,760
-You are lucky.
-Thank you.

406
00:47:22,448 --> 00:47:27,480
Mr. Shetty, actually I have no ideas of films.

407
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,312
I am making this film to make my daughter happy.

408
00:47:33,938 --> 00:47:39,430
He is Mr. Goyal. He is taking care of this project.

409
00:47:40,056 --> 00:47:46,616
Sir, I am a reputed director in the market and
I work on my conditions.

410
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:50,440
Very good. I have no problem with that.

411
00:47:50,816 --> 00:47:52,281
I want to say something.

412
00:47:52,657 --> 00:47:56,556
-Yes, go on.
-I don't make films with new boys.

413
00:47:58,134 --> 00:48:03,689
-Why?
-Yes, but I can take new boys as supporting actors.

414
00:48:04,065 --> 00:48:05,334
But I

415
00:48:06,648 --> 00:48:13,843
But Mr. Shetty, my daughter wants him to do a leading role.

416
00:48:13,843 --> 00:48:14,585
Of course

417
00:48:14,585 --> 00:48:19,261
Sir, this is the business and I don't include
emotions in business.

418
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:22,054
-I see
-I mean

419
00:48:24,871 --> 00:48:30,000
Dear, serve tea or coffee to Veer

420
00:48:30,313 --> 00:48:32,911
Uh.. sure dad

421
00:48:42,112 --> 00:48:48,065
-Megha
-Akshay! no calls, no messages. How is it possible?

422
00:48:48,628 --> 00:48:52,875
You were busy shooting for days. I was missing you.

423
00:48:53,438 --> 00:48:56,836
That's okay. I'll see you after the shoot.
You can go now.

424
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:11,753
Hi, Hi dear. I met with the director.
I found him talented.

425
00:49:12,504 --> 00:49:16,509
But he has some ideas. He gave me some advice.

426
00:49:16,885 --> 00:49:23,127
As our banner is new, so we should make
our first movie with a superstar.

427
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:24,941
As it's important for movie to be a hit.

428
00:49:24,941 --> 00:49:30,320
And I want Veer to do a side role in this film.

429
00:49:30,883 --> 00:49:34,779
No dad, but he is so talented.
You can't just waste him like that.

430
00:49:34,779 --> 00:49:37,195
I know dear. No, we are not wasting.

431
00:49:37,195 --> 00:49:40,296
He's there. We have to make more films, right?

432
00:49:40,296 --> 00:49:43,110
If this film doesn't succeed then it's of no use

433
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,603
If will ruin Veer's life too.

434
00:49:44,603 --> 00:49:46,493
I wish you good luck

435
00:49:46,493 --> 00:49:49,510
My dear, since I don't know much about films.
I can't argue.

436
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,799
Don't worry. We will make another film.
Okay.

437
00:49:53,237 --> 00:49:55,560
-You come with me
-Yes, sir

438
00:49:56,123 --> 00:50:00,979
I know Veer but Mr. Shetty is a reputed director.
I think you must accept his advice.

439
00:50:01,355 --> 00:50:06,422
And you never know, after doing a small role in this big film
May be you will noticed.

440
00:50:06,422 --> 00:50:11,927
-And you get offers for main lead.
-Please Janvi, I don't want to talk on this topic.

441
00:50:18,186 --> 00:50:22,502
Samrat, book a ticket for pune in today's date.
Yes, urgently

442
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:37,333
-Hi Samrat
-Hi

443
00:50:37,646 --> 00:50:41,028
-Where are you going?
-No, it's someone else's ticket.

444
00:50:41,028 --> 00:50:45,567
-What else is going on?
-I am doing a project as a lead hero.

445
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,311
Good, I am happy to hear that.
Which production?

446
00:50:49,311 --> 00:50:50,560
R. M. Films

447
00:50:50,873 --> 00:50:53,757
R.M? Is it Rehana Mirza?

448
00:50:53,757 --> 00:50:54,849
Yes, Why?

449
00:50:54,849 --> 00:50:58,030
If you don't mind, shall I tell you something?

450
00:50:59,094 --> 00:51:05,008
I have all the details about Rehana Mirza.
She is a big fraud.

451
00:51:05,008 --> 00:51:08,157
She cheated many bringing them with films.

452
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:16,519
None of her project starts.
Take care dude. I am leaving. Bye.

453
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,760
Who is it?

454
00:51:33,386 --> 00:51:36,450
He was out for the whole day.

455
00:51:41,895 --> 00:51:45,650
-Here is your ticket.
-Take the money kept on the table.

456
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:50,825
I have so much work. I haven't packed.
Nothing is ready. Oh God!

457
00:51:53,688 --> 00:51:56,047
I am so busy. Upset. Oh no!

458
00:51:56,047 --> 00:51:57,845
I wanted to ask you something.

459
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,812
When will we start shooting?

460
00:52:00,812 --> 00:52:03,476
Come on. Can't you see, how busy I am?

461
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,318
Will talk about it after I return. Okay

462
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:08,440
You will not lose time just to say it.

463
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:14,068
Firstly that scoundrel Sharma is not paying

464
00:52:14,068 --> 00:52:15,509
And you are bothered about shooting

465
00:52:15,509 --> 00:52:18,023
Where should I get the money from? Tell me!

466
00:52:18,023 --> 00:52:19,624
Shooting...shooting

467
00:52:20,876 --> 00:52:23,561
God knows where they come from?

468
00:52:27,191 --> 00:52:29,155
Look at our luck

469
00:52:29,593 --> 00:52:34,817
When we come so close and we fail.
It hurts a lot.

470
00:52:41,697 --> 00:52:42,200
Hello!

471
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:49,168
Akshay, do you know the producer dismissed
the director of the film you signed?

472
00:52:49,481 --> 00:52:53,691
-What?
-Go quickly and check what happened.

473
00:52:58,038 --> 00:53:02,290
-I am sorry Akshay. I shut this project.
-But, sir.

474
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:07,348
Akshay, this project was upsetting me.

475
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,746
Anyway, I don't want to discuss anything.

476
00:53:13,248 --> 00:53:15,000
You can go now.

477
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:41,182
Megha!

478
00:53:44,106 --> 00:53:46,044
I want to meet Mr. Khanna

479
00:53:46,044 --> 00:53:47,838
Alright, I will wait for you at the parking.

480
00:54:02,171 --> 00:54:07,975
The amount that we spoke of, she has taken it little by little.
Total 2.5 Crores

481
00:54:10,979 --> 00:54:14,675
She knows how to trap a man. Bitch!

482
00:54:15,927 --> 00:54:21,077
I heard she brought a flat in Pune. With my money?

483
00:54:33,908 --> 00:54:35,718
Megha, I need to talk to you

484
00:54:39,774 --> 00:54:42,960
Sit in the car. We'll talk on our way.

485
00:54:58,983 --> 00:55:07,389
-Akshay, you talk to me in front of others. I don't like it.
-What? What are you saying?

486
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:13,290
The topic wasn't personal. I was talking normally.

487
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:21,204
Please don't follow me. I don't like it.
After all I am a heroine.

488
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:29,220
And you know all my films are superhit.
Please! I have a reputation in the market.

489
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:32,013
What are you saying, Megha?

490
00:55:32,013 --> 00:55:37,264
Please try to understand. I don't want the media
to associate me with a struggler.

491
00:55:38,578 --> 00:55:40,748
I don't want to spoil my career.

492
00:55:41,749 --> 00:55:45,512
It means I was a fool to consider you as a friend.

493
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:47,550
Stop the car.

494
00:55:53,121 --> 00:55:55,588
What happened? Why did you stop the car?

495
00:55:55,588 --> 00:55:59,603
Why should we walk together when our destiny is different?

496
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,261
I like your reply and you understood if very soon.

497
00:56:05,513 --> 00:56:09,055
All the best... Bye!

498
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,962
Why did you do this to me?

499
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,902
-Don't point finger at me
-What did you get in return?

500
00:57:05,902 --> 00:57:07,902
-Look at you
-You cheated on me

501
00:57:07,902 --> 00:57:09,714
-With the help of Sharma
-Stay in your limits

502
00:57:09,714 --> 00:57:14,658
Shut up! have you seen your status?
You are a mere struggler, scoundrel.

503
00:57:14,658 --> 00:57:18,614
Will you argue with me? Rehana Mirza?
You have no status. Leave my house.

504
00:57:18,614 --> 00:57:20,760
You came drunk to fight with me.

505
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,130
It's not my fault. Forgive me.

506
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:31,017
Yes, sir. I will do it.

507
00:57:31,518 --> 00:57:34,726
Sir, sir forgive me.

508
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:38,460
Will you rape a female?

509
00:57:39,086 --> 00:57:41,624
- Sir

510
00:57:44,315 --> 00:57:46,031

Yes, tell me. Alright, I will bring in the evening.

512
00:58:05,055 --> 00:58:10,335
-Hello, sir. These are the bail papers.
-Yes, keep it

513
00:58:14,028 --> 00:58:15,000
Constable

514
00:58:32,879 --> 00:58:33,669
Thank you, sir

515
00:58:57,391 --> 00:58:58,807
Look, who's there?

516
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:12,210
-Does Samrat Pandey lives here?
-Yes, he lives here.

517
00:59:15,778 --> 00:59:17,555
Have a seat.

518
00:59:22,786 --> 00:59:24,529
Uncle, what's the matter?

519
00:59:24,889 --> 00:59:29,569
Samrat, your mom is trying to call you up.

520
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:36,036
But you don't pick up the call or drop the call.

521
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,489
So, she had to call me up.

522
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:46,399
She said, ask Samrat to talk to me.

523
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:09,175
Yes, sister-in-law. I am in Samrat's room.
He is here with me. Talk to him.

524
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,499
Yes, mom

525
01:00:14,499 --> 01:00:16,754
I tried to tell you many times.

526
01:00:17,943 --> 01:00:22,667
But you didn't listen to our problems due to your stubbornness.

527
01:00:23,919 --> 01:00:28,684
What I always feared has happened to us

528
01:00:28,684 --> 01:00:40,691
Samrat, I always told you. You have an elder sister.
She is getting old. Anything can happen.

529
01:00:49,203 --> 01:00:51,676
Alright, I am leaving now.

530
01:00:51,676 --> 01:00:57,980
-Uncle, will you have tea or coffee?
-No, I am getting late. Bye

531
01:01:08,454 --> 01:01:17,088
Now I am defeated.

532
01:01:17,088 --> 01:01:19,240
-Mom let me go
-Like a bird

533
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:23,080
The work is good and I will get good money.

534
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:26,736
All my breath

535
01:01:26,736 --> 01:01:30,820
Without my support

536
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:34,514
Everything is shut

537
01:01:34,514 --> 01:01:38,471
All doors and windows are shut

538
01:01:38,471 --> 01:01:45,569
My world is here

539
01:01:46,257 --> 01:01:55,414
Now I am defeated

540
01:01:55,414 --> 01:02:00,000
Smarat, that's enough. Forget about films.

541
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,752
I have signed a film.

542
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:04,507
Very soon everything will be fine.

543
01:02:20,228 --> 01:02:43,603
My life is ruined by my dreams

544
01:02:43,603 --> 01:02:50,920
I accept pain by accepting high

545
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,675
I tried to reach the sky

546
01:02:54,675 --> 01:02:58,662
I couldn't take care of minor things.

547
01:02:58,662 --> 01:03:03,012
I found no sky nor land.

548
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:09,924
Pain, I am defeated now.

549
01:03:10,237 --> 01:03:14,253
Like a bird

550
01:03:14,253 --> 01:03:18,036
Pain

551
01:03:19,037 --> 01:03:20,729
But you didn't understand

552
01:03:21,981 --> 01:03:24,327
Do you know what happened?

553
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:33,777
Your sister had an affair and she was pregnant.

554
01:03:34,071 --> 01:03:43,852
When I found out. I went to him with a proposal of marriage.
But he refused.

555
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,091
He said it is her business.

556
01:03:50,779 --> 01:03:54,026
She felt dejected by the society and her dignity.

557
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:00,000
No one was there to talk or support her.

558
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,939
At that moment, she needed you the most.

559
01:04:05,316 --> 01:04:10,929
She couldn't bear our helplessness and desperation

560
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:16,116
And she took poison.

561
01:04:16,641 --> 01:04:25,531
And son, you dropped all my calls or didn't picked up at all.

562
01:04:26,219 --> 01:04:43,999
Now my son, wherever you are just be happy. Just be happy.

563
01:05:06,093 --> 01:05:10,526
Akshay, we will be lonely without you.

564
01:05:12,153 --> 01:05:13,747
Please stay back.

565
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,715
I can't stop myself any longer.

566
01:05:18,013 --> 01:05:21,999
I hate hypocrites and this field

567
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:26,720
I didn't obtain anything here instead lost.

568
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:31,360
I can't bear anymore. I am leaving now.

569
01:05:57,456 --> 01:05:58,593
Bye!

570
01:06:52,011 --> 01:06:56,650
-Shreshth, can I say something?
-Yes

571
01:06:57,777 --> 01:07:01,301
Will I get some work in your play?

572
01:07:01,614 --> 01:07:03,803
You and play?

573
01:07:03,803 --> 01:07:11,510
Yes, Instead of wasting time.
It's better I do some work in your play.

574
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:17,610
-After all, it's acting there too.
-Are you serious?

575
01:07:18,424 --> 01:07:24,821
-I mean you are not fooling me, right?
-Please! I am serious.

576
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:26,799
Then okay.

577
01:07:30,617 --> 01:07:32,431
Just a minute

578
01:07:33,745 --> 01:07:36,250

A film is not shot only by money.

610
01:09:21,781 --> 01:09:27,214
In this film, we have nothing to give you.

611
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:33,344

623
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:17,372

Lord, Mr. Kapoor is preparing to release the film.

730
01:16:48,779 --> 01:16:52,396
May the distributer get ready to release the film.

731
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:57,970
The film should be released easily.
I pray this to you.

732
01:17:05,043 --> 01:17:06,867
-The rest is fine.
-Yes

733
01:17:06,867 --> 01:17:08,368
What is the project about?

734
01:17:10,183 --> 01:17:12,807
Sir, It's a beautiful love story.

735
01:17:13,808 --> 01:17:19,638
And everyone in the unit worked hard
to make this beautiful film.

736
01:17:20,201 --> 01:17:23,882
Shooting is not important.
Who's the star cast?

737
01:17:23,882 --> 01:17:25,336
Sir, everyone is a newcomer.

738
01:17:25,962 --> 01:17:29,022
-Sir, he means it's his first film.
-Okay

739
01:17:29,022 --> 01:17:32,502
-I produced for the first time. I mean we all are newcomers.
-Right

740
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:34,629
-Okay
-Sir, It's a great film

741
01:17:34,629 --> 01:17:39,865
Sorry, I am not interested in releasing new comer's film.

742
01:17:39,865 --> 01:17:41,721
Mr. Kapoor, I am outside. Come out.

743
01:17:41,721 --> 01:17:45,413
-Just a moment.
-Come out, I am waiting.

744
01:17:45,413 --> 01:17:47,387
Mr. Shukla, don't go I'll just

745
01:17:47,387 --> 01:17:50,510
-Yes, They are new comers.
-He is a new comer, right?

746
01:17:51,011 --> 01:17:53,077
-I can do the film
-Thank you

747
01:17:53,515 --> 01:17:58,423
But do one thing. Get a good big film to me.

748
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:01,702
-Look, we plan a big film very soon.
-Right

749
01:18:01,702 --> 01:18:03,829
-We are discussing it with a big star.
-Okay

750
01:18:03,829 --> 01:18:06,919
-Mr. Kapoor will direct the film and get it to you.
-Yes

751
01:18:07,295 --> 01:18:09,595
Once this film is released then

752
01:18:09,595 --> 01:18:14,473
I deal with diamonds, I can't do coal business.

753
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,786
By releasing small films
I can't ruin the reputation of my company.

754
01:18:22,413 --> 01:18:24,885
Mr. Kapoor, tell me one thing?

755
01:18:25,573 --> 01:18:30,392
When you came with the script to me
Did you tell me even once...

756
01:18:30,705 --> 01:18:39,402
Sir, invest once and after that go from door to door
Like a beggars knocking at it.

757
01:18:39,402 --> 01:18:42,109
Did you tell me even once?

758
01:18:42,109 --> 01:18:45,160
Sir, which director will tell you before the film is made?

759
01:18:48,168 --> 01:18:50,701
Sir, we worked hard on this film.

760
01:18:50,701 --> 01:18:52,482
-You have made a good film.
-Yes

761
01:18:52,482 --> 01:18:54,050
I can see the hard work.

762
01:18:55,239 --> 01:18:57,734
-Well your film is good.
-Yes

763
01:18:57,734 --> 01:19:00,536
-I am ready to get it released
-Thank you, sir

764
01:19:00,536 --> 01:19:02,058
-Thank you, sir
-Don't worry

765
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:03,591
-Thank you
-Actually

766
01:19:04,843 --> 01:19:08,560
My assistant will give you an estimate

767
01:19:09,061 --> 01:19:12,091
-Sir, in the next meeting
-Yes, we will meet again.

768
01:19:12,091 --> 01:19:15,000
-The agreement and the other things
-Everything will be done.

769
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,749
Sir, what will be the estimate contains?

770
01:19:18,749 --> 01:19:22,153
Nothing much.
You want to release the film, right?

771
01:19:22,153 --> 01:19:25,798
-I have the experience, don't worry
-Right

772
01:19:25,798 --> 01:19:33,758
Just 2 Crore rupees for the marketing is required.
And 30 Lakh which is our fees, just pay that.

773
01:19:35,198 --> 01:19:38,213
You mean to say that we have to pay
Rupees 2 Crores and 3 Lakhs

774
01:19:38,213 --> 01:19:42,308
-Just a sec.. I mean we
-I will let you know

775
01:19:42,308 --> 01:19:44,189
You think a lot

776
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,578
I didn't grow old without experience.

777
01:19:47,891 --> 01:19:51,237
I have 25 years of experience in this field about distribution.

778
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:59,678
If you finalize with us then I will open all the windows
From Kashmir to Kanyakumari

779
01:19:59,678 --> 01:20:02,084
Watch it how money flows

780
01:20:02,084 --> 01:20:03,990
Can I talk to Mr. Kapoor once?

781
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:05,820
-Okay
-Then we'll talk to you.

782
01:20:06,133 --> 01:20:07,719
-Think of it
-Mr. Kapoor, come out

783
01:20:08,595 --> 01:20:10,037
-Just a minute
-Mr. Shukla

784
01:20:10,037 --> 01:20:12,165
Please come out

785
01:20:12,979 --> 01:20:15,303
Mr. Shukla...Mr. Shukla!

786
01:20:27,946 --> 01:20:28,949
Mr. Shukla

787
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,671
Mr. Kapoor, listen to one thing

788
01:20:33,047 --> 01:20:36,361
One man doesn't like the film, he feels it's small

789
01:20:36,361 --> 01:20:37,817
The second man feels something is missing.

790
01:20:37,817 --> 01:20:41,619
The third man who understands, asking for 2 crores 30 lakhs.

791
01:20:41,619 --> 01:20:43,729
Where to pay? Shall I sell my house?

792
01:20:43,729 --> 01:20:47,654
I will make my family homeless.
We'll come to your place, right?

793
01:20:47,967 --> 01:20:50,527
But how can I come to your place.
You have no home.

794
01:20:50,527 --> 01:20:53,432
Mr. Shukla, do you trust me or not?

795
01:20:54,997 --> 01:20:56,684
I have taken up the responsibility.

796
01:20:56,997 --> 01:20:58,621
-Okay
-This is struggle

797
01:21:02,475 --> 01:21:04,550
Don't worry, everything will be fine.

798
01:21:04,988 --> 01:21:07,821
Let's go inside...

799
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:09,929
Mr. Shukla, please remain calm

800
01:21:09,929 --> 01:21:12,237
-May I come in sir?
-Yes, come in

801
01:21:12,237 --> 01:21:14,357
-Yes, sir. This is Mr. Shukla!
-Hello

802
01:21:14,357 --> 01:21:17,481
He has a good reputation in Lucknow.

803
01:21:18,357 --> 01:21:20,951
Mr. Shukla

804
01:21:25,207 --> 01:21:30,200
-Mr. Kapoor
-Please come

805
01:21:38,185 --> 01:21:40,107
Serve me tea

806
01:21:46,804 --> 01:21:47,544
Sir!

807
01:21:59,668 --> 01:22:06,669
Mr. Shukla, there is Mr. Mehboob Khan whom I know.
He is a good distributor.

808
01:22:06,982 --> 01:22:08,694
Let's meet him once.

809
01:22:13,138 --> 01:22:15,581
What will happen if we meet him?

810
01:22:15,957 --> 01:22:21,483
You took me to many distributors till now.
But what happened?

811
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:26,473
You are taking me to so many places.
Did anything happen?

812
01:22:27,036 --> 01:22:29,549
They have such small offices

813
01:22:29,549 --> 01:22:32,550
You make me sit with the people
whom I prefer not to meet.

814
01:22:32,863 --> 01:22:37,200
My bathroom is huge than their office.
And you have seen it.

815
01:22:38,139 --> 01:22:42,550
You know I am wealthy.

816
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:45,000
I haven't lied about anything.
You know everything.

817
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:50,414
Mr. Kapoor, I told you that
Fortuner cars will queue up and it's true.

818
01:22:50,414 --> 01:22:52,993
As even I send my Fortuner car for them.

819
01:22:53,412 --> 01:23:00,589
The minister will wait with garland. I said it.
They will wait as each vote counts.

820
01:23:00,589 --> 01:23:04,782
I went to each and every village and got it for them.

821
01:23:05,408 --> 01:23:07,785
So won't they support me?

822
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:14,583
I build a reputation, Mr. Kapoor!

823
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:22,040
You have ruined... I mean, you made fun of my reputation.

824
01:23:22,416 --> 01:23:28,327
I will tell you one more thing.
That's it. I can't bear it anymore.

825
01:23:28,327 --> 01:23:33,192
You did what you had to do. I made the film.
The film is good. I like it.

826
01:23:33,192 --> 01:23:35,262
And you are confident that the film is good.

827
01:23:36,451 --> 01:23:39,129
But when you go to them
They call our film is a waste

828
01:23:40,068 --> 01:23:45,635
You said, you know many people.
Let the film be made once then watch it.

829
01:23:45,635 --> 01:23:48,675
I saw it.. I saw it everything.

830
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:54,096
Mr. Kapoor, you are aware
that I am quiet because of you

831
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:59,840
Or if it was someone else
I would explain the film to him.

832
01:24:00,341 --> 01:24:03,200
The number of times we went to offices

833
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:07,840
If it was someone else at your place
I would hire him to do my household chores.

834
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:12,561
And I will kick him daily too.

835
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:18,850
That's the limit.

836
01:24:19,538 --> 01:24:24,542
Forget that.. Listen to me now and do one thing

837
01:24:24,918 --> 01:24:28,787
I will spend 1 Crore more for all these distributors.

838
01:24:29,163 --> 01:24:34,676
Get all these distributors by air to Lucknow.

839
01:24:35,177 --> 01:24:37,612
I will book their stay at "The Taj"

840
01:24:37,925 --> 01:24:49,392
And Mr. Kapoor, the next day they will
Walk and stick the posters till Mumbai.

841
01:24:49,392 --> 01:24:52,709
Then you can name your dog after me

842
01:25:01,472 --> 01:25:07,641
Let's meet him once... Just for once.

843
01:25:09,112 --> 01:25:11,519
-Please
-Mr. Kapoor

844
01:25:13,209 --> 01:25:15,543
Alright, let's go

845
01:25:17,546 --> 01:25:19,800
But this is the last time.

846
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:24,219
After this I will return to Lucknow.

847
01:25:24,595 --> 01:25:28,420
And do anything with the film.

848
01:25:28,733 --> 01:25:31,522
Report it to me on phone calls, okay!

849
01:25:31,522 --> 01:25:35,197
-How much is the bill?
-Sir, It is Rs.20

850
01:25:36,073 --> 01:25:37,223
Take it

851
01:25:37,223 --> 01:25:40,603
-Thank you, sir
-Let's go, come

852
01:25:40,916 --> 01:25:42,712
Where do we go from? Here or there?

853
01:25:45,466 --> 01:25:49,366
Let's go, come

854
01:25:52,330 --> 01:25:55,133
Mr. Kapoor!

855
01:25:55,133 --> 01:25:56,632
-Greeting, Mr. Khan
-How are you? - Please sit

856
01:25:56,945 --> 01:25:59,475
I am fine. He's Mr. Shukla

857
01:25:59,475 --> 01:26:00,476
-Hello
-Be seated

858
01:26:00,476 --> 01:26:01,695
He is the producer of my film.

859
01:26:01,695 --> 01:26:02,914
Long time, no see

860
01:26:03,352 --> 01:26:05,299
-I was busy with a film.
-Did you do anything new?

861
01:26:05,299 --> 01:26:07,686
Yes, a new work.
I worked hard on a film.

862
01:26:07,686 --> 01:26:11,378
And you must understand that you will enjoy it

863
01:26:11,378 --> 01:26:13,422
Mr. Khan, I have come here with great hopes.

864
01:26:13,422 --> 01:26:15,566
It will be done.
Do you want to want to release it, right?

865
01:26:15,566 --> 01:26:16,462
-Yes
-It's not a big deal.

866
01:26:16,462 --> 01:26:19,278
One call from me and all the theatres will be booked

867
01:26:19,654 --> 01:26:22,440
-Thank you. You can do it.
-Don't worry.

868
01:26:22,816 --> 01:26:26,071
-His distribution is very prompt.
-Jugnoo, get tea for us.

869
01:26:26,071 --> 01:26:26,759
Yes, sir

870
01:26:26,759 --> 01:26:29,759
Did you bring anything?

871
01:26:34,766 --> 01:26:38,769
-What to get?
-Mr. Kapoor, I am not talking about money.

872
01:26:39,332 --> 01:26:42,744
-Did you get the trailer?
-Yes, do you have the...pen drive?

873
01:26:42,744 --> 01:26:46,805
-Jugnoo, get the laptop
-Yes, sir. Right away.

874
01:26:46,805 --> 01:26:52,943
-Show it to me
-This theatrical one for you. It's a trailer.

875
01:26:53,819 --> 01:26:54,995
Give it here

876
01:26:55,621 --> 01:26:57,380
-Shall we play it?
-Yes

877
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:00,338
Good

878
01:27:12,105 --> 01:27:13,240
-It's nice
-Okay

879
01:27:14,742 --> 01:27:18,434
Wow, that's good. Very nice

880
01:27:23,629 --> 01:27:26,662
That's good, Mr. Kapoor

881
01:27:28,016 --> 01:27:32,581
-The trailer is very good.
Sir, we worked hard for it.

882
01:27:33,019 --> 01:27:38,257
I won't say yes or no.
I will watch the whole film first.

883
01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:44,733
Keep a screen. I will call few people.
We will watch it and decide it

884
01:27:44,733 --> 01:27:48,832
-Don't decide on it. Just get it released.
-God's willing, it will be released

885
01:27:49,564 --> 01:27:53,230
Mr. Shukla, I won't promise
How big the release will be

886
01:27:53,668 --> 01:27:58,104
But I will make Kapoor
the director of a released film.

887
01:27:58,586 --> 01:28:00,786
-Yes, Thank you
-Arrange for the screening.

888
01:28:00,786 --> 01:28:02,895
Yes, sure. We will do it.

889
01:28:03,834 --> 01:28:05,724
-God bless you
-All the best -Thank you

890
01:28:05,724 --> 01:28:06,926
Let's go

891
01:28:18,255 --> 01:28:19,997
Oh, hi baby!

892
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:27,613
-Sorry, I am late.
-I want to talk.

893
01:28:28,427 --> 01:28:31,085
Don't worry.
We'll elope and get married.

894
01:28:31,085 --> 01:28:32,343
It's not a solution.

895
01:28:33,031 --> 01:28:37,792
I cleared it to you on the first day
That I won't marry against the will of my family.

896
01:28:39,232 --> 01:28:41,689
-Please baby
-It's not possible.

897
01:29:17,115 --> 01:29:20,793
I like this scene very much, Mr. Kapoor

898
01:29:20,793 --> 01:29:23,015
-Mr. Khan
-It's funny

899
01:29:29,712 --> 01:29:32,195
Hurray...Hurray!

900
01:29:32,195 --> 01:29:34,110
Wow!

901
01:29:38,116 --> 01:29:39,965
Mr. khan, how is the movie?

902
01:29:39,965 --> 01:29:42,097
Very good.
Congratulations, Mr. Kapoor

903
01:29:44,162 --> 01:29:46,842
Mr. Kapoor, we put life in the film.

904
01:29:47,468 --> 01:29:50,024
Control yourself.
You are the producer.

905
01:29:52,277 --> 01:29:55,472
How did you like the film?

906
01:29:55,973 --> 01:29:58,372
Good. Good. We enjoyed it.

907
01:29:58,372 --> 01:30:01,960
Brother, the film is great.
It will do good business.

908
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:05,819
I feel you were crying with me.
Your eyes have turned red.

909
01:30:06,257 --> 01:30:08,702
Okay Kapoor, Done
Come to the office

910
01:30:08,702 --> 01:30:10,675
-Let's do an agreement.
-Right

911
01:30:10,675 --> 01:30:13,170
-We will talk there
-Thank you

912
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:14,858
-Sir, how are you
-Very good

913
01:30:14,858 --> 01:30:16,297
-How is the film?
-Very good

914
01:30:16,297 --> 01:30:18,988
-Sir, Mr. Kapoor is amazing.
-Yes

915
01:30:18,988 --> 01:30:21,741
Mr. Shukla is from Lucknow.
Control yourself.

916
01:30:21,741 --> 01:30:25,263
-Yes
-Sir, did you like the performance of the boy and the girl?

917
01:30:25,263 --> 01:30:27,613
-It's good. Very good.
-Let me call them

918
01:30:27,613 --> 01:30:28,801
-Veer
-Come here

919
01:30:28,801 --> 01:30:29,301
Coming sir

920
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,170
-He is Veer
-Hello, sir

921
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:35,532
-And she is Rhea
-Good job, you did a good job.

922
01:30:35,532 --> 01:30:38,410
-Hello sir. Thank you
-Hello sir. Thank you, sir

923
01:30:38,723 --> 01:30:41,739
The emotional scene was so touchy.
I cried twice.

924
01:30:42,115 --> 01:30:43,301
Very good

925
01:30:43,301 --> 01:30:44,281
-Cheers
-Thank you -Thank you

926
01:30:44,281 --> 01:30:46,430
-Thank you, sir
-Mr. Khan has as office at Adarsh Nagar

927
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:47,744
He has released 2500 films.

928
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,119
-Mr. Kapoor
-Yes, hello

929
01:30:49,119 --> 01:30:49,783
Great

930
01:30:51,974 --> 01:30:58,534
I was crying bitterly during the emotional scene.
You both did magic.

931
01:30:58,534 --> 01:31:01,350
-Mr. Shukla, he is calling us.
-Okay!

932
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:03,374
-Shall we go?
-Please

933
01:31:08,882 --> 01:31:11,277
-Hello, Mr. Khan
-Please come

934
01:31:12,216 --> 01:31:15,000
-How are you?
-I am good

935
01:31:17,003 --> 01:31:22,051
I don't know how to say it.
Mr. Kapoor, there is a big confusion.

936
01:31:22,051 --> 01:31:28,163
What is the confusion, Mr. Khan?
Please tell me clearly

937
01:31:28,163 --> 01:31:32,420
Dakshraj Production House
Knows about your film

938
01:31:34,924 --> 01:31:38,726
You know, their two films are
getting released one by one.

939
01:31:39,164 --> 01:31:42,522
They don't want a good film
to be released against their film.

940
01:31:42,522 --> 01:31:45,000
As it will give them competition
and ruin their business.

941
01:31:46,314 --> 01:31:50,085
-What are you saying?
-I am not saying it.

942
01:31:50,085 --> 01:31:51,714
They called me up an hour ago.

943
01:31:52,027 --> 01:31:55,520
They said that I shouldn't
release your film.

944
01:32:07,162 --> 01:32:09,432
So now what?

945
01:32:10,433 --> 01:32:16,847
Mr. Shukla, they are big producers
and I am a small distributor.

946
01:32:16,847 --> 01:32:20,225
I can't fight with them being
in the same business?

947
01:32:20,851 --> 01:32:25,062
I am sorry. I can't accept your film.

948
01:32:26,502 --> 01:32:28,816
-You know us.
-Yes

949
01:32:28,816 --> 01:32:32,800
-You also know that our film is good.
-Yes - Even then you aren't supporting us.

950
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,731
Mr. Kapoor, I know you.
I also know your film is good.

951
01:32:36,731 --> 01:32:40,673
But what can I do?
Try to understand my situation.

952
01:32:40,673 --> 01:32:45,609
We kept the trial on your request.
Your friends came to watch it.

953
01:32:45,609 --> 01:32:49,655
Our guests came and appreciated the film.
Infact you also appreciated the film.

954
01:32:49,655 --> 01:32:51,420
Yes, I did it. I am not refusing it.
It is a good film.

955
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:55,488
-What does it mean?
-But, they and I have no comparisons.

956
01:32:56,051 --> 01:32:57,872
-Try to understand Mr. Shukla
-But the appreciation!

957
01:32:57,872 --> 01:33:00,688
I am sorry,. I am really very sorry

958
01:33:11,892 --> 01:33:14,558
Sorry, Mr. Kapoor

959
01:33:32,646 --> 01:33:35,391
-What are you searching for?
-My towel

960
01:33:35,391 --> 01:33:37,644
It's on your shoulder

961
01:33:38,833 --> 01:33:42,446
Where are you lost?
Why are you so upset?

962
01:33:42,884 --> 01:33:46,956
Dakshraj refused it.
There are many in the industry.

963
01:33:47,269 --> 01:33:50,337
You are saying as though
your world is ended here.

964
01:33:52,152 --> 01:33:55,904
Go to their competitor.
You will get many other chances.

965
01:33:56,217 --> 01:33:58,328
You won't die because
of this one production house.

966
01:33:58,829 --> 01:34:04,624
Do one thing. Groom yourself.
Go and take the bath. Freshen up.

967
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:18,955
-Yes, Mr. Kapoor
-I got an Idea

968
01:34:19,268 --> 01:34:23,598
White Angel distribute
Dakshraj Productions films

969
01:34:24,286 --> 01:34:26,873
And their competitor is Blue Ocean

970
01:34:27,249 --> 01:34:29,571
We will speak to Blue Ocean.
We will take their shelter.

971
01:34:29,571 --> 01:34:31,511
They will get our film released, right?

972
01:34:31,511 --> 01:34:34,467
Yes, it's fine.
I will reach there right away.

973
01:34:34,467 --> 01:34:37,373
No, do one thing.
How will you go?

974
01:34:37,749 --> 01:34:40,500
I will take you there.
I will take a taxi from here

975
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:44,517
-Meet me at the Lokhandwala corner.
-I will walk to that spot.

976
01:34:44,517 --> 01:34:45,895
Alright...Okay!

977
01:35:02,262 --> 01:35:05,533
Well done. Nice

978
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:07,922
Mr. Kapoor, you made a great film.

979
01:35:07,922 --> 01:35:09,440
Thank you, sir. Thank you

980
01:35:10,066 --> 01:35:11,330
Well written

981
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:17,234
Get this film released once.
I will get four more films done.

982
01:35:17,234 --> 01:35:21,053
Mr. Shukla, control yourself.
Contain your excitement.

983
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:23,997
Who is the boy?

984
01:35:23,997 --> 01:35:27,657
-Sir, he is Veer Yadav. A new comer
-Okay

985
01:35:27,657 --> 01:35:32,954
Sir, consider that I am giving
another superstar to the industry.

986
01:35:32,954 --> 01:35:36,512
-Note it down
-He's very hard working guy.

987
01:35:36,512 --> 01:35:40,025
-The boy has some substance.
-Yes, absolutely the boy has an element.

988
01:35:40,025 --> 01:35:43,892
-And he looks wonderful on the screen. The film is full of press.
-Yes

989
01:35:43,892 --> 01:35:45,845
It will be very easy for me to sell it.

990
01:35:45,845 --> 01:35:47,952
Thank you sir. Thank you so much.

991
01:35:47,952 --> 01:35:50,389
Alright, let's do one thing

992
01:35:50,389 --> 01:35:54,000
We are ready to release the film.
What do you say?

993
01:35:54,438 --> 01:35:56,897
Do one thing.
Come to the office tomorrow.

994
01:35:57,273 --> 01:36:03,213
-We will sign our contract.
Thank you sir. -Nice

995
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:08,820
Thank you so much.
Mr. Kapoor, I want to say something

996
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:13,460
Sir, I want you to premier
this film at Lucknow once.

997
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:18,106
I will have a red carpet ready.
The ministers will welcome you with garlands.

998
01:36:18,106 --> 01:36:20,920
Leave his hand. It will hurt him.

999
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:25,976
Sir, I have gone to Mr. Shukla's place at Lucknow.
Consider the whole Lucknow to be his.

1000
01:36:25,976 --> 01:36:28,840
Light burns where he pees.

1001
01:36:29,278 --> 01:36:32,425
-We can also premier at Lucknow too.
-Yes

1002
01:36:32,425 --> 01:36:36,365
-We will think about it.
-Thank you, sir

1003
01:36:36,365 --> 01:36:39,515
-Thank you
-Let's go, Mr. Shukla

1004
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,840
-You forget things and get excited
-What to do I got carried away.

1005
01:37:08,251 --> 01:37:10,639
Yes, Hello

1006
01:37:11,140 --> 01:37:15,000
Mr. Shukla, where are you?
I've been calling you since morning.

1007
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,566
It's already late.
Why haven't you reached here?

1008
01:37:17,566 --> 01:37:19,443
-Are you sure, you are coming?
-No, I am not coming

1009
01:37:19,819 --> 01:37:22,071
Why? What are you saying?

1010
01:37:22,071 --> 01:37:25,450
I am not interested in the film.
Nor do I want to work with you.

1011
01:37:25,450 --> 01:37:28,742
Mr. Shukla, wait
I am coming.. I will come to meet you.

1012
01:37:28,742 --> 01:37:35,087
Tell me your location.
Hello.. Mr. Shukla...

1013
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:47,813
Mr. Shukla, you did a wonderful job
By listening to our demand.

1014
01:37:48,877 --> 01:37:51,301
The one who stands
against us faces loses.

1015
01:37:51,927 --> 01:37:55,837
-And you earned a profit before the release of the film.
-Sir

1016
01:37:55,837 --> 01:37:59,437
-If you continue this friendship you will continue to earn too.
-Sir

1017
01:37:59,437 --> 01:38:03,847
-Anyway we will business as partners.
-Yes, sir

1018
01:38:04,348 --> 01:38:08,290
Sir, it's your generosity
that I am here with you.

1019
01:38:08,290 --> 01:38:11,441
Sir, have your next project in U.P

1020
01:38:11,817 --> 01:38:15,800
I will get the subsidy.
I know the C.M too, honestly.

1021
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:23,106
Send a notice to Mr. Kapoor

1022
01:38:23,106 --> 01:38:24,765
-Yes, sir
-Is it okay?

1023
01:38:24,765 --> 01:38:25,754
As you say

1024
01:38:27,945 --> 01:38:33,966
Sir, what is written in this notice?
And why did Mr. Shukla sent you the notice?

1025
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:40,160
Mr. Shukla and I had a
partnership deal for this project.

1026
01:38:41,224 --> 01:38:48,041
Mr. Shukla will invest in this project.
Planning, hard work and direction will be mine.

1027
01:38:48,479 --> 01:38:50,131
We made the film.

1028
01:38:50,444 --> 01:39:01,019
If I and Mr. Shukla have the differences
Where the situation is that we can't work with each other

1029
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:07,422
Then I will return him money and film will be mine.

1030
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:16,440
If I don't pay him then he will
give me my share of hard work

1031
01:39:17,316 --> 01:39:21,507
He will compensate for my work
And the film will belong to him.

1032
01:39:22,133 --> 01:39:25,400
That's why he gave me
One months time.

1033
01:39:25,838 --> 01:39:31,961
Sir, why is Mr. Shukla is doing this?
Please talk to him

1034
01:39:32,775 --> 01:39:33,844
I don't know

1035
01:39:34,282 --> 01:39:41,229
Dakshraj Productions have misguided
and confused him completely.

1036
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:47,627
I feel he has sold himself
to the Dakshraj Productions house.

1037
01:39:49,505 --> 01:39:51,760
Sir, what will we do the next?

1038
01:39:52,261 --> 01:39:55,621
We have one month in hand.
Let us see what to do.

1039
01:39:55,621 --> 01:39:58,059
First I will try to get the film.

1040
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:08,148
Sir, may I come in?

1041
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:10,654
-I saw your film.
-Thank you

1042
01:40:10,654 --> 01:40:15,000
It's a very nice film.
I am interested to finance your film.

1043
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,305
Thank you, sir!

1044
01:40:16,681 --> 01:40:19,669
-I am going out for a few days.
-Right

1045
01:40:20,107 --> 01:40:24,200
We will sign the agreement after I return.
I will finance you.

1046
01:40:24,513 --> 01:40:30,993
Sir, my partner has the rights.

1047
01:40:30,993 --> 01:40:37,591
Do you anything as security
which you can give us?

1048
01:40:37,967 --> 01:40:40,119
Based on that we can finance you.

1049
01:40:40,557 --> 01:40:45,000
Like gold, property, shares anything.

1050
01:40:47,128 --> 01:40:49,280
I have a film and me.

1051
01:40:50,094 --> 01:40:54,827
Sorry, It's company's policy.
I cannot help you, sorry

1052
01:41:23,381 --> 01:41:28,070
You, being a director talking foolishly.

1053
01:41:28,571 --> 01:41:33,340
When you have no rights then
Why will a financer, finance you film?

1054
01:41:35,969 --> 01:41:38,171
Blue Ocean is releasing it

1055
01:41:38,171 --> 01:41:41,842
You are talking foolishly again
Did he gave you anything in writing? No

1056
01:41:41,842 --> 01:41:43,782
No distributors gives anything in written

1057
01:41:43,782 --> 01:41:46,078
He didn't gave anything in written, right?
That's it

1058
01:41:46,704 --> 01:41:53,600
Look Shyam, next time when you come to me
Get a proper and reliable project.

1059
01:41:54,038 --> 01:41:56,471
-Mustafa!
-Yes, I am coming. I here.

1060
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:45,000
Hello! Greetings. No!
No greetings today

1061
01:42:45,751 --> 01:42:47,691
Please don't mind

1062
01:42:49,944 --> 01:42:52,732
I came twice in a day to meet you.

1063
01:42:55,549 --> 01:42:58,568
Firstly I met in you in the evening.

1064
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:06,880
And now when I am returning home.
I thought of meeting you.

1065
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:12,930
Not just meet but talk to you.

1066
01:43:14,307 --> 01:43:16,975
It's nice you are not
doing anything now.

1067
01:43:20,543 --> 01:43:25,193
I am not a superstar that I will say
You must be very happy.

1068
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:32,863
I want to tell you that
You are very sad

1069
01:43:37,495 --> 01:43:39,732
Tell me one thing

1070
01:43:41,172 --> 01:43:45,000
What lacked in my commitment?

1071
01:43:48,317 --> 01:43:51,660
I wrote that story
with so much of hard work.

1072
01:43:52,036 --> 01:43:56,236
I took pains to
search for a producer.

1073
01:43:58,740 --> 01:44:04,343
I lost weight to gather actors,
cast and crew.

1074
01:44:08,349 --> 01:44:12,973
I didn't eat or sleep.
I didn't bother about myself or relationships.

1075
01:44:13,849 --> 01:44:17,012
I gave my all for this film.

1076
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:22,955
I took care of this film
Like a child since 10 years

1077
01:44:28,150 --> 01:44:32,066
But it's nothing for you
You stopped my film from release.

1078
01:44:35,696 --> 01:44:43,224
Earlier I though it was the distributor
Between the film and theatre.

1079
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:48,482
No, I was wrong

1080
01:44:50,172 --> 01:44:54,196
Now I believe you played the game.

1081
01:44:58,765 --> 01:45:01,362
Why are you harassing me alone?

1082
01:45:02,489 --> 01:45:07,220
The world contains 7500 crores people.

1083
01:45:08,472 --> 01:45:13,390
And you know that I am
better than those crores.

1084
01:45:17,208 --> 01:45:21,142
Some say the hero is new.
Some say there is no heroine.

1085
01:45:21,142 --> 01:45:24,117
Some say the producer is new.
Some say the director is new.

1086
01:45:24,117 --> 01:45:27,866
Some say the film is low budget.
Some say it's an over budget film.

1087
01:45:27,866 --> 01:45:30,501
Some say add this and some say add that

1088
01:45:32,441 --> 01:45:35,555
If this was not there
Wouldn't I make another film?

1089
01:45:38,434 --> 01:45:39,742
Shouldn't I ?

1090
01:45:43,247 --> 01:45:46,025
Should I bury my creativity right here?

1091
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:49,466
Lord!

1092
01:45:51,531 --> 01:46:02,043
I made this film with so much of hard work.
Please get it release.

1093
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:04,420
Please!

1094
01:46:07,613 --> 01:46:10,552
I beg of you!
I will say this and leave.

1095
01:46:11,866 --> 01:46:14,814
Alright, we will meet again soon.

1096
01:46:23,827 --> 01:46:25,280
Hey wake up!

1097
01:46:26,407 --> 01:46:29,334
Wake up, is this is the place to sleep?

1098
01:46:30,934 --> 01:46:33,772
Dunk yard! Get up

1099
01:46:36,150 --> 01:46:37,689
Go

1100
01:47:58,805 --> 01:48:00,450
Please give me a cup of tea

1101
01:49:18,311 --> 01:49:22,479
See my luck . Earlier I didn't get a film.

1102
01:49:22,479 --> 01:49:26,760
When I got it and completed.
It is not getting released.

1103
01:49:27,824 --> 01:49:31,135
Don't be so disheartened.
Some or the other will happen.

1104
01:49:31,511 --> 01:49:33,988
What will happen?
Tomorrow is the last day.

1105
01:49:34,364 --> 01:49:37,256
Mr. Kapoor can't pay Mr. Shukla

1106
01:49:37,569 --> 01:49:39,811
Mr. Shukla will get the film.

1107
01:49:41,313 --> 01:49:43,981
And he won't let
the film get released

1108
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:49,857
Mr. Kapoor is calling up?

1109
01:49:51,672 --> 01:49:54,141
-Hello, Mr. Kapoor
-Yes, Veer

1110
01:49:54,767 --> 01:50:00,000
-Where are you?
-Yes, sir. What is it?

1111
01:50:00,376 --> 01:50:06,503
Do you know Saxena's office
at Heera-Panna mall?

1112
01:50:06,816 --> 01:50:08,032
Yes, sir

1113
01:50:08,032 --> 01:50:09,960
Come there, I am waiting for you.

1114
01:50:10,336 --> 01:50:11,773
I'll be there right away.

1115
01:50:13,025 --> 01:50:14,216
Do you have to go?

1116
01:50:14,529 --> 01:50:17,072
Yes, Mr. Kapoor called up.
I need to go urgently.

1117
01:50:17,072 --> 01:50:18,800
-Okay, you take care
-Yes

1118
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,716
-See you
-Bye

1119
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:31,663
Check the papers.
We have to pay Mr. Shukla one crore

1120
01:50:44,682 --> 01:50:47,560
Thank you. Can I leave?

1121
01:51:02,017 --> 01:51:03,440
Sit down

1122
01:51:04,316 --> 01:51:10,266
This is the power of attorney of the film
For which I am nominating you.

1123
01:51:10,266 --> 01:51:17,297
Henceforth you will take
the decisions regarding film, instead of me.

1124
01:51:21,553 --> 01:51:25,263
Sir, I can't understand anything

1125
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:28,020
Why are you doing this?

1126
01:51:31,462 --> 01:51:37,320
I am going abroad.
It may take longer to me to return.

1127
01:51:38,008 --> 01:51:44,071
Right now, your fulfil your responsibility and

1128
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,200
Lawyer!

1129
01:51:47,201 --> 01:51:58,852
-This is a cheque of one crore.
-Right

1130
01:51:59,290 --> 01:52:03,154
Give this cheque to Mr. Shukla, okay?

1131
01:52:04,030 --> 01:52:08,521
Just follow the lawyer
as he says to do.

1132
01:52:08,521 --> 01:52:11,253
-Okay
-Okay, sir

1133
01:52:12,192 --> 01:52:24,920
When you get all the rights
Then release the film with Blue Ocean.

1134
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:54,706
Vinita, say aloud.
"Ramesh you won't know the worth of a pinch of Vermillion.

1135
01:52:54,706 --> 01:52:57,394
Ramesh you won't know the worth of a pinch of Vermillion

1136
01:52:57,394 --> 01:53:02,360
No, say it with feelings if you want to become an
actress then show feelings.
-Sir

1137
01:53:03,612 --> 01:53:08,277
This is draft of the money of your
film production which Mr. Kapoor has sent.

1138
01:53:09,717 --> 01:53:12,360
-What is this? Draft?
-Yes

1139
01:53:21,053 --> 01:53:24,447
Sir, sign all the pages of this document.

1140
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:36,025
-Veer
-Yes, sir

1141
01:53:36,025 --> 01:53:38,541
I didn't want to do this to Mr. Kapoor

1142
01:53:39,855 --> 01:53:43,666
I but don't know how

1143
01:53:44,354 --> 01:53:47,105
Maybe I got carried away
by the Dakshraj Production Company.

1144
01:53:47,418 --> 01:53:51,170
Forget it sir!
These things don't matter anymore.

1145
01:53:51,733 --> 01:53:57,968
You did what you wanted to do.
Sir, please sign it.

1146
01:54:23,629 --> 01:54:24,838
Thank you, sir

1147
01:54:48,371 --> 01:54:50,588
After all, your hard work paid off.

1148
01:54:50,588 --> 01:54:53,944
Your film will be released tomorrow.
I am so excited.

1149
01:54:55,071 --> 01:54:56,407
Wow!

1150
01:54:57,194 --> 01:55:02,828
I am also very happy
But something is nudging me.

1151
01:55:03,767 --> 01:55:07,960
If Mr. Kapoor was with us
Things would be different.

1152
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:10,600
I know, he would be so pleased to see this.

1153
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:54,241
-Janvi, what are you doing? I am getting impatient
-Surprise! I am sure you will love it

1154
01:55:59,468 --> 01:56:03,453
-Hey, don't you love it?
-What is this?

1155
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,637
Celebrations! Since your film is a hit.

1156
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:09,490
-Congratulations!
-Thank you

1157
01:56:09,490 --> 01:56:12,627
-Hey I am so glad
-Congratulations - Thanks

1158
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:16,507
Sorry, I don't want all this

1159
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:20,080
But why? You should be happy

1160
01:56:20,581 --> 01:56:24,823
We won't celebrate anything
Until Mr. Kapoor returns

1161
01:56:25,136 --> 01:56:26,448
Sorry!

1162
01:56:27,011 --> 01:56:29,114
-Okay
-Excuse me!

1163
01:56:34,059 --> 01:56:36,880
Hello! Where are you, sir?

1164
01:56:48,084 --> 01:56:53,046
-Sir, what happened?
-Nothing! have a seat.

1165
01:56:57,400 --> 01:57:01,595
What happened about the film?

1166
01:57:01,908 --> 01:57:06,320
-What is the position of the film?
-Sir, It's fantastic

1167
01:57:08,072 --> 01:57:11,888
We got a huge pickup
with mouth publicity.

1168
01:57:12,201 --> 01:57:16,683
All shows, theatres, multiplexes were houseful.

1169
01:57:18,122 --> 01:57:24,217
I believed this film will
ruled the hearts of the people

1170
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:31,757
Sir, you have been lately operated.
Don't stress yourself by speaking a lot.

1171
01:57:31,757 --> 01:57:33,865
You have only one kidney.
Go to sleep.

1172
01:57:33,865 --> 01:57:40,144
-Come on, please sleep
-Sister, the film is doing well.

1173
01:57:47,091 --> 01:57:54,141
Operation? Sir, the draft of one crore?

1174
01:57:55,330 --> 01:57:58,632
Did you sell your kidney for that?

1175
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:06,700
I didn't sell my kidney.

1176
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,565
I donated my kidney
to save my friend's life.

1177
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:24,000
And he gave me a loan of
One crore to get my film released.

1178
01:58:29,133 --> 01:58:39,362
Veer! This is what I wished
That I make a good film.

1179
01:58:39,362 --> 01:58:42,802
And get it released in a good way.

1180
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:58,559
I wouldn't back off to sell my organs
For that not just my kidney.

1181
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:13,974
You are great, sir.
You are great.

1182
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:22,336
I like the film is doing
Mind blowing business.

1183
01:59:34,814 --> 01:59:36,726
Hello!

1184
01:59:41,107 --> 01:59:45,840
Thank so much for coming
And your co-operation.

1185
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:53,760
The film is doing well.
Our lead actors and our whole unit is very happy.

1186
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:55,700
We have your co-operation.
Thank you so much.

1187
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:57,950
Sir, is this your
real life love story

1188
01:59:57,950 --> 02:00:01,888
A struggler director has no love story.
Everyone tries to use them.

1189
02:00:03,015 --> 02:00:07,161
Sir, you were not seen during publicity or premier!
Do you have reason behind it.

1190
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:10,000
I had gone abroad.

1191
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,853
It is reported that you and the producer had
a fight during the shooting of this film.

1192
02:00:13,853 --> 02:00:16,237
No, we didn't fight
during the shooting.

1193
02:00:17,051 --> 02:00:19,760
We had a difference after
the film was completed.

1194
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:24,280
Sir, what do you think that will you
get the best director award this year?

1195
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:28,919
Sir, you are a God Father for me

1196
02:00:29,357 --> 02:00:32,210
I dedicate my award to you.

1197
02:00:32,210 --> 02:00:33,760
Thank you so much!

1198
02:00:35,450 --> 02:00:37,318
-Cheers!
-Cheers!
