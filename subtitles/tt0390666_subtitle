...a biggest jewellery shop
has been robbed today.

1038
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,388
Consider that the police comes
there and that girl says that...

1039
01:32:26,592 --> 01:32:29,716
...she did this robbery with
the help of DSP Gupta then?

1040

But how she'll prove this?

1041
01:32:33,776 --> 01:32:36,854
Why? If the necklace will be found from...

1042
01:32:37,282 --> 01:32:40,383
...Mr. Gupta's pocket during the checking...

1043
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:43,132

your friend will have?

If this will really happen then
Mr. Gupta will be in trouble.

1046
01:32:58,384 --> 01:33:00,300
And it's also possible
that the girl might have...

1047
01:33:00,607 --> 01:33:06,084
...kept the rest of the gold
ornaments at Mr. Gupta's house?

1048
01:33:06,391 --> 01:33:09,169
What? But where she can hide it?

1049
01:33:10,017 --> 01:33:12,432
- There are people at home.
- So what?

1050
01:33:13,577 --> 01:33:15,194
There are many places at home.

1051
01:33:16,467 --> 01:33:20,934
For example... she can also
hide it in the flower vase.

1052
01:33:22,975 --> 01:33:27,145
Anyway, let go off that.
Mr. Gupta will solve his problem.

Yes, very much.

almost similar to this.

standing here at my place.

escape in such situation?
