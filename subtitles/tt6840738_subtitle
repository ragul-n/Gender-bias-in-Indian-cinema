1
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,592
'In a village,
there were two best friends...'

2
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:19,822
'...Shiva Kumar and Vasudeva.'

3
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:23,349
'Same school, same bench, same goal...'

4
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:25,403
'...the two were quite studious.'

5
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,997
'Vasudeva belonged to a rich family...'

6
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:30,173
'...and Shiva Kumar
belonged a poor family.'

7
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:33,728
'Poverty stalled Shiva
Kumar's education.'

8
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,363
'Time passed by.'

9
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:39,755
'Vasudeva is now a renowned
auditor and owns an auditing company.'

10
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,971
'Coincidently,
Shiva Kumar who quit education...'

11
00:01:44,296 --> 00:01:47,188
'...is working as a clerk
in the same office.'

12
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,634
'Though there's poverty...'

13
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:54,822
'...he has a wife who stands by
him during the ups and downs of life.'

14
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:57,526
'As a result of their love...'

15
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,688
'...Girija is now pregnant.'

16
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:13,107
My God!

17
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:22,147
Her condition is very critical,
have you informed her family?

18
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:24,120
Yes, doctor.
- Be bold.

19
00:02:24,822 --> 00:02:26,322
Slowly.

20
00:02:42,716 --> 00:02:46,256
Electricity is back even
before you could bring the candle.

21
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:49,257
Go, it's 11 o'clock, bring the file.

22
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:50,608
Coming, sir.

23
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:55,689
Sir, file.
- There dust on it, clean it.

24
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:57,202
Sir, it's there.
- Sorry, sir.

25
00:02:57,282 --> 00:02:59,364
It's right there.
- In this file?

26
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:01,378
Have you read income tax rules?

27
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,040
If we don't submit
the returns by 10 tomorrow...

28
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,229
...the income tax officials
will raid our clients...

29
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:08,161
...our office will be seized
and you will lose your job.

30
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:09,942
Sir, file.
- Where is it?

31
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:12,667
Clear the cup, there's
no place to even keep the paper.

32
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,840
Go and answer the phone.
- Okay, sir.

33
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:17,142
Clear the cup.

34
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:19,748
Bring the ashtray.
- Okay, sir.

35
00:03:24,257 --> 00:03:25,897
Hello.
- Hello, who is this?

36
00:03:26,104 --> 00:03:27,819
Grandma? What happened?

37
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:30,757
Your wife has developed labor pain...

38
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:34,243
...we have hospitalized her
please come at the earliest.

39
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,391
Oh, my God! Sir!

40
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:39,491
What?
- Girija has been hospitalized...

41
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,871
...I had promised to be by her
side at the time of the delivery...

42
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:45,898
...time is passing by, it is also raining,
please manage things here.

43
00:03:45,978 --> 00:03:48,563
What are you saying?
There are no assistants in the office...

44
00:03:48,882 --> 00:03:51,110
...and you know him better than me.
- Sir?

45
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,531
The two of you have
been classmates. Do this.

46
00:03:53,611 --> 00:03:55,254
Stop chatting.
- Go...

47
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,853
Go and bring tea.
- Bring tea, I will do something.

48
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,451
Go. Sir!

49
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:18,291
Sir, was there a
call from the hospital?

50
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,612
Nobody called,
go and serve coffee first.

51
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,110
Sir, my grandma said she will call.

52
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,510
Nobody called.

53
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,528
You shouldn't keep the
original documents on the table...

54
00:04:35,648 --> 00:04:38,094
...make copies of them,
you should then...

55
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:41,809
Sir! The documents...

56
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:47,434
Shiva, it's baby boy.

57
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:54,519
Glory to Goddess.

58
00:04:55,993 --> 00:04:58,034
Your wife and the baby are doing good...

59
00:04:58,114 --> 00:04:59,979
...come at the earliest.

60
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:01,473
Okay, grandma.

61
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,856
Vasu!

62
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:15,790
Vasu, it's a baby boy.

63
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:20,764
Here, have sweet. Sir, please.

64
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:22,695
Sir, it's a baby boy.

65
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:26,112
Sudhakar sir...
- Congratulations.

66
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:28,838
Sir, please. Sir, please.

67
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:32,040
Vasu, I am very happy...

68
00:05:39,658 --> 00:05:40,945
I am not your friend.

69
00:05:43,622 --> 00:05:45,592
I am not your friend.

70
00:05:47,226 --> 00:05:52,138
I have seen you since childhood
hence I have showed mercy on you...

71
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:55,407
...don't cross your limits.

72
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,985
This is my office.

73
00:05:58,503 --> 00:06:01,599
I am your boss and you are a peon.

74
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:05,422
You had a baby?

75
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:13,945
Even animals give birth to babies
raise them, but it's futile.

76
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,383
Children born to people
like you are burden to earth.

77
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:23,888
You don't deserve to get married...

78
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,773
...or have children.

79
00:06:29,146 --> 00:06:31,629
Do you know the value of this?

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,614
You're an orphan,
you don't deserve a son.

81
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,884
Stop staring at me.

82
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:45,793
I know you are good for nothing.

83
00:06:47,263 --> 00:06:48,984
What will you make out of your son?

84
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,444
You're just a peon.

85
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:57,010
Will you make him an engineer?

86
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:00,728
Will you make him a doctor?

87
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:04,069
Will you make him a lawyer?

88
00:07:08,998 --> 00:07:10,603
Will you make him an auditor?

89
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,347
Will you make him an auditor and bring
him to my position?

90
00:07:16,427 --> 00:07:18,071
Yes, I will.

91
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:20,311
I will bring him to your position.

92
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,030
Hey...

93
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:27,759
You're my friend,
insult me if you want...

94
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:34,596
...abuse me if you want hit me
and I won't say a word...

95
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:42,401
...but if you say a word against my son...

96
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:45,726
...who has just come to this world...

97
00:07:46,927 --> 00:07:51,320
...I will kill you, I will kill you.

98
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:59,519
When you walk, one leg
is forward and the other backward...

99
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:03,670
...the leg that's forward never
takes pride since it is leading...

100
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,192
...and the leg backward never
feels sad since it is backward.

101
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:10,271
Tell me why? Answer me.

102
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,674
Because it knows that its position
will change in just a moment.

103
00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:20,324
Darn you.

104
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,227
Shiva Kumar, congratulations.

105
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:27,904
You've become a father of a baby boy.

106
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,151
It is not baby boy, doctor...

107
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:43,861
...an officer has born to me.

108
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:54,199
What are you doing?

109
00:10:54,372 --> 00:10:56,517
I want him to become knowledgeable.

110
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:58,944
Whose idea is it?

111
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:01,788
It's my idea.
- You silly.

112
00:11:02,652 --> 00:11:03,690
Come.

113
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,721
Box then clear...

114
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,066
The great...
- Kumar, let's play.

115
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:53,319
Come on.
Ma'am, please send him.

116
00:13:53,563 --> 00:13:54,610
Come on.
- Hey!

117
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,083
Kumar, come on.
- What's your problem?

118
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,910
They want to play?

119
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,104
They are gone, calm down.
- I won't. Come with me.

120
00:14:02,184 --> 00:14:04,678
Allow him to study.
- Be quiet. Come inside.

121
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,280
Don't others begot children?
Is she the only one who has begot son?

122
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,214
Take it.

123
00:15:07,294 --> 00:15:09,642
One shouldn't water the plant
with minimum water...

124
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:11,191
...otherwise the plant will get ruined.
- Okay.

125
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:14,495
He doesn't let his son do
anything except make him study.

126
00:15:14,855 --> 00:15:16,681
Like I iron clothes finely...

127
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:18,392
...he is providing his son
with complete education.

128
00:15:18,663 --> 00:15:22,450
He wants his son to follow his rules.

129
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:27,570
Since planet Jupiter is moving from
seventh house to the eighth house...

130
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,029
...his family will propose.

131
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:52,116
My darling son.

132
00:15:52,443 --> 00:15:53,466
Good...

133
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:58,377
Kumar!
- Girija!

134
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,869
How many times do I call out for you?
Have breakfast...

135
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:01,596
Girija, come here.
- What is it?

136
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:02,601
Why are you screaming?

137
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:05,592
Neither he drank coffee
nor had breakfast. Come.

138
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:08,735
Education is more important
than anything. Try to understand.

139
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:11,489
You always yell at me. See the time.

140
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:13,599
Are you getting late?
- Oh, my God.

141
00:16:13,738 --> 00:16:16,235
Pack my food soon, I will get ready.

142
00:16:16,547 --> 00:16:17,581
Dear.
- Yes?

143
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:19,594
Shall I pack okra fry for lunch?

144
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,834
Don't scream.

145
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:27,973
Industry, big auditor one day...

146
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,137
Father, I wanted Rs 5000.

147
00:16:30,217 --> 00:16:31,842
Organization development.
- What for?

148
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:34,732
Today is the last
day to pay tuition fees.

149
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:36,315
You should've told me earlier.

150
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,015
Won't you give me the money?
- I will give, wait.

151
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:43,000
Girija, I had given
you Rs 5000 to buy sari...

152
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,703
...give that money to him.

153
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:44,716
Dear.
- Yes?

154
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,965
I get that money once in a year,
I won't give it.

155
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:51,056
My son is in need of money, today is
the last day to pay his tuition fees...

156
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,021
...give him the money. Go and take it.
- Dear...

157
00:16:53,844 --> 00:16:56,210
He always does that.
- What are you blabbering?

158
00:16:56,404 --> 00:16:57,490
Nothing.

159
00:16:58,694 --> 00:16:59,573
Thank you. Bye.

160
00:16:59,794 --> 00:17:02,695
The economics is the foundation
and skill development...

161
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:04,505
Bye.

162
00:17:06,394 --> 00:17:07,538
Girija.
- Yes?

163
00:17:07,618 --> 00:17:08,975
My son is good in English.

164
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:19,340
Did you bring the venerations items?

165
00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:21,012
Right.

166
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:25,968
What are you doing?
We have guest coming home.

167
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:28,860
You must finish the
decoration in 10 minutes.

168
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,005
Idiots!

169
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:33,343
He's trying to teach us decoration.

170
00:17:33,423 --> 00:17:35,924
He developed grey
hair at a very young age

171
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:38,069
we must ask him to dye his hair first.

172
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,377
Welcome to our humble office.

173
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,369
This is my staff,
helpers, peons.

174
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:50,345
Nice atmosphere.
- Please come.

175
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:52,083
Sir, good morning.

176
00:17:52,163 --> 00:17:53,682
Sir, myself Shiva Kumar.

177
00:17:53,892 --> 00:17:55,896
Rajankunte, Nelakunte, Gowdarahalli.

178
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,406
Sir, father of Shiva Kumar.

179
00:17:57,813 --> 00:18:00,607
My son is studying in 3rd
year B.com in Vijayanagar College.

180
00:18:00,868 --> 00:18:02,462
Sir, he scored good
marks in the first two years...

181
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:04,238
...he is aiming for
distinction in 3rd year.

182
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:06,692
He's a very good student.
He will pursue higher studies...

183
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:08,529
...he will then become
an officer like him.

184
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:11,988
Please come else
he won't stop talking.

185
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:13,706
All the best, Mr. Shiva Kumar.

186
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:16,783
Convey my best wishes to your son.
- Sir, please have sweet.

187
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,589
Sir, sweet...

188
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:23,598
Dear, coffee.

189
00:18:23,678 --> 00:18:25,355
Where is the fourth page?

190
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:28,110
You will get it
if you stop being a miser.

191
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,995
What can I do if our neighbor
took away the fourth page?

192
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,852
Let that be. Where is our daughter?

193
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,520
She has gone for group studies.

194
00:18:36,378 --> 00:18:37,409
Group studies?

195
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:10,032
Why are you late?

196
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:15,435
Daddy, I was doing combined
studies that's why I am late.

197
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,901
Why do you worry?

198
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:19,575
Am I a little girl?
- I worry because you are grown up.

199
00:19:19,655 --> 00:19:21,634
Why do you regret having a daughter?

200
00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:24,260
Take me to be a boy.

201
00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:26,353
You are lenient towards
her as she is your only daughter...

202
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:27,353
...now you pay the price.

203
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,635
Did I tell you not to have one more child?

204
00:19:29,715 --> 00:19:30,858
You should've gone ahead with it.

205
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,245
It is futile to bat
after the match is over.

206
00:19:34,344 --> 00:19:35,566
You will bat...

207
00:19:35,747 --> 00:19:37,687
...but you need someone to bowl.

208
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,557
"Won't you talk to me?"

209
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,990
"Won't you...?"

210
00:19:45,406 --> 00:19:48,314
Mom, who removed the photo?

211
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:53,969
Kirti, girls are fond of heroes...

212
00:19:54,224 --> 00:19:57,322
...but you are fond of villains.

213
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,882
If your husband to be sees them,
what would he think?

214
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:04,209
Dad, I am only fond of
villains ever since childhood.

215
00:20:04,563 --> 00:20:07,154
I will marry the boy only
if he has the character of a villain.

216
00:20:08,422 --> 00:20:09,839
So there will be another
villain in our family.

217
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:15,097
Sir, I have complained to you thrice...

218
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,453
...but you took no action.

219
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,383
He takes the college to be a circus...

220
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,960
...he treats the staff like animals.

221
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,130
There is evidence against him.

222
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:27,942
He has taken you for granted.

223
00:20:28,022 --> 00:20:30,909
He passes comments during the lecture.

224
00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:34,416
It's really painful.
- He ruining the entire college.

225
00:20:34,654 --> 00:20:37,027
Who are you complaining about?

226
00:20:37,107 --> 00:20:40,278
We are complaining
against College Kumar.

227
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:43,103
Kumar. He will never reform.

228
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:11,302
Buddy, start the bike.

229
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:21,636
How about a selfie?

230
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:01,123
Here you are.

231
00:24:01,203 --> 00:24:03,245
Nani, are you exercising?

232
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:05,336
Do you want to have six packs?

233
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,727
Six packs? I am an old man.

234
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,485
I was too drunk yesterday,
I am having a hangover.

235
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,948
I had lost this but I found it.

236
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:15,823
I have never seen an idiot like you.

237
00:24:16,411 --> 00:24:20,183
I am your father's friend not yours.

238
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:22,453
You must show some respect to me.

239
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:24,161
Okay, I will.

240
00:24:24,314 --> 00:24:28,244
I need your help.
- I swear by the liquor, I won't help you.

241
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,614
You won't help me? - No.

242
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:32,719
Look at this. Swear by this and say...

243
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,783
...you won't help me
and I will walk away.

244
00:24:34,863 --> 00:24:36,289
Give it to me.
- It's imported scotch.

245
00:24:36,427 --> 00:24:39,892
I know. Butter in front of fire...

246
00:24:40,122 --> 00:24:44,180
...and liquor in front of me,
they will melt away.

247
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:45,437
Never mind.
- What about me?

248
00:24:47,423 --> 00:24:48,876
Drink this.
- You must come tomorrow at 9 o'clock.

249
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:49,819
Don't you want my help?

250
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:52,006
You must surely come.
Okay? - Okay, go.

251
00:24:52,285 --> 00:24:54,423
Don't get over drunk.
- All right, get going.

252
00:24:54,778 --> 00:24:58,053
I will come only if I don't
get over drunk. Get going.

253
00:24:59,187 --> 00:25:00,033
Sir, post.

254
00:25:00,735 --> 00:25:03,555
Post.
- It's mine. I am coming. Give it to me.

255
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,112
It's not yours.
- It is mine. You leave.

256
00:25:05,192 --> 00:25:06,238
Who is he?

257
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:08,934
I'll escape.
- Nani!

258
00:25:09,014 --> 00:25:10,502
Yes, ma'am.
- The postman was here.

259
00:25:10,582 --> 00:25:12,019
What did he give?
- Nothing.

260
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:14,601
It's a college matter, I will read it out.
- Is it from the college?

261
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:18,017
It must be Kumar's. Listen, there's
a letter for Kumar from the college.

262
00:25:18,097 --> 00:25:20,164
Is Kumar at home?
Okay, I'll give it to him.

263
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:21,591
I will give it to him.
- No, I will give it to him.

264
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:24,292
I will give it to him.
- Listen... Hey you!

265
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:26,298
It's 10:30 and you still haven't left
for your office.

266
00:25:26,378 --> 00:25:27,225
I got late today.

267
00:25:27,305 --> 00:25:28,088
He will leave...

268
00:25:28,168 --> 00:25:29,224
...but first give me the letter.
- Which letter?

269
00:25:29,304 --> 00:25:30,521
There's a letter for Kumar
from the college...

270
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:31,418
It's 10:30
and you haven't gone to office yet.

271
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:32,395
There's a letter from the college.
Give it to me.

272
00:25:32,475 --> 00:25:33,884
Give it to me.
- Wait, I will read it out for you.

273
00:25:34,222 --> 00:25:36,031
Listen, ma'am... - Do you
think I don't know to read Kannada?

274
00:25:36,219 --> 00:25:37,753
Give it to me. - No, I will read it.

275
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:38,948
He's my son, I will read it myself.
- Okay.

276
00:25:39,028 --> 00:25:40,730
You read it.
- You can't read without your glasses.

277
00:25:41,803 --> 00:25:43,043
Let me read it out.

278
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:46,565
'Hooliganism, harassment, smoking cigarette
and drinking liquor in the college.'

279
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,322
Hey, read it properly.

280
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:50,332
I'll read it.

281
00:25:50,412 --> 00:25:54,743
'Kumar has brought a new
zest in the college students.'

282
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:56,083
Our boy is too smart.

283
00:25:56,271 --> 00:26:00,500
'Kumar is a very intelligent
student and tops the class.'

284
00:26:00,949 --> 00:26:02,443
He is a topper.

285
00:26:02,663 --> 00:26:04,642
'Your son Kumar is the
most brilliant student.'

286
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:07,692
Superb.
- Will you just hear the praises?

287
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:09,437
I'm telling you such a sweet matter...

288
00:26:09,517 --> 00:26:10,331
...can't you get me sweets?
- Wait, I'll get it.

289
00:26:10,411 --> 00:26:12,162
I'll come in the night.
- Give it to me, I will read it.

290
00:26:12,242 --> 00:26:14,445
Hey, give it to me.

291
00:26:14,525 --> 00:26:15,798
Until you look for your glasses...

292
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:17,817
I will forget what is written in it.
Wait a moment.

293
00:26:17,938 --> 00:26:19,112
'He's a champion in sports.'

294
00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:20,418
'He participates in the
college cultural program...'

295
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:23,973
'...and has become an example
to the other students.'

296
00:26:24,662 --> 00:26:25,902
Give me the sweet. Thank you.

297
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,817
'Your son Kumar is
the pride of our college.'

298
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,394
Pride.

299
00:26:31,474 --> 00:26:34,108
That's what even I said.
- Give that to me.

300
00:26:34,228 --> 00:26:35,331
I will get it framed.

301
00:26:35,411 --> 00:26:37,281
Give that to me,
I will keep it before God's idol.

302
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:38,735
Girija, listen to me. Where is he?
- Kumar!

303
00:26:38,815 --> 00:26:40,484
He went into that room.
- Did Kumar come?

304
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:42,359
Hey!

305
00:26:43,522 --> 00:26:46,656
I thought I was eating sweet,
but I ate the paper. I am sorry.

306
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:49,945
I'm eating sweet,
even this paper is sweet.

307
00:26:50,091 --> 00:26:51,150
Oh no!

308
00:26:53,035 --> 00:26:54,613
Abhi, why are you crying?

309
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,343
What happened? Do you need any help?

310
00:26:59,255 --> 00:27:01,867
You guys are so cheap. You always
look for a chance to talk to girls.

311
00:27:01,947 --> 00:27:02,713
Get going.

312
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:04,467
She's too much.

313
00:27:05,268 --> 00:27:06,428
What happened to you, madam?

314
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:09,504
I think she's scared because
she didn't prepare for the math exams.

315
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:12,513
Oh, why worry about that? Just tie
a talisman to our Boss, Lord Anjaneya.

316
00:27:12,593 --> 00:27:13,714
Why are you getting scared?

317
00:27:13,794 --> 00:27:17,537
If I fail in my exams this time,
my parents will get me married.

318
00:27:18,434 --> 00:27:20,302
Please, do something.

319
00:27:20,382 --> 00:27:22,966
Don't worry.
Let's buy the question paper.

320
00:27:23,046 --> 00:27:24,126
Question paper?

321
00:27:24,425 --> 00:27:26,634
Who will you buy it from?
- My brother said,

322
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,158
there's a guy named
Kumar in Vijaynagar.

323
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:31,051
He does these kinds of jobs.

324
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:33,166
We don't know him.

325
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:36,095
He fools people by lying to them.

326
00:27:36,175 --> 00:27:37,489
He is not a nice guy

327
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:39,969
He promised principal's daughter that
he will get her pass the exams...

328
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:41,812
and took money from her. He's a liar.

329
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:42,924
He's a thief.

330
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:44,808
Really?

331
00:27:45,736 --> 00:27:46,915
Very interesting.

332
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:49,051
Come on, let's go meet him.

333
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:51,595
Which one?
- Math.

334
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:52,670
You have to pay me Rs. 10,000.

335
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,950
So much for PUC paper...
- Can't you do it for Rs. 2000?

336
00:27:55,377 --> 00:27:56,124
You have to pay me Rs. 20,000.

337
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:01,702
Okay, I'm ready to pay Rs. 10,000.

338
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:04,774
Advance...
- No advance, I want full payment.

339
00:28:05,252 --> 00:28:08,271
Will you deliver
the paper to our house?

340
00:28:08,391 --> 00:28:11,189
What? Have you ordered a pizza
that it will be delivered home?

341
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:14,132
I will call you by evening 7:00,
come and collect it.

342
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:15,998
You've grown so old,

343
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:18,621
but you don't have
any general knowledge.

344
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:21,251
Do you know why people drink beer?

345
00:28:21,394 --> 00:28:22,308
I don't know.

346
00:28:22,388 --> 00:28:26,250
Hey, this contains Vitamin B1, B2, B6.

347
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,252
If you suffer from heart problem,
drink this.

348
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:31,323
It will clean your heart
and if you are a fool...

349
00:28:31,403 --> 00:28:34,153
...it will go from the liver
to the brain and clean it.

350
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,779
If you suffer from kidney stones,
it will cleans your kidneys...

351
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,208
...and will make your urine very clear.

352
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,827
You even get good sleep with it.

353
00:28:41,907 --> 00:28:43,785
Rum, brandy.

354
00:28:43,865 --> 00:28:45,384
Whiskey is the superior most.

355
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:46,934
Kumar, please come.

356
00:28:47,014 --> 00:28:48,429
What's the matter?
Did you finish your work? - Yes, all done.

357
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:49,369
What's the matter?
Did you finish your work? - Yes, all done.

358
00:28:49,449 --> 00:28:52,732
What will you have? Hey, get
the same for Kumar, one full bottle!

359
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,907
Hey, I was checking
the accounts the other day.

360
00:28:55,057 --> 00:28:57,692
The bill has gone up to Rs. 2300.

361
00:28:57,896 --> 00:28:59,907
He has charged Rs. 100 extra from us.

362
00:28:59,987 --> 00:29:03,179
Kumar, you always keep
an account of everything.

363
00:29:03,329 --> 00:29:05,853
Forget me, my son is a calculator.

364
00:29:06,004 --> 00:29:08,293
He's like a local Aryabhatta.

365
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:09,578
That's been taken care of.

366
00:29:10,277 --> 00:29:12,314
No, don't worry. It's alright.

367
00:29:13,147 --> 00:29:15,683
Have you ever heard
my son speaking English?

368
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:19,154
Yes, I have.
He speaks so good English that

369
00:29:19,327 --> 00:29:21,939
he can compete with
the president Trump.

370
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:23,786
He knows every word from the...

371
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,447
...American Oxford dictionary.

372
00:29:26,527 --> 00:29:31,363
My son threatens me that he will
fall in love and elope with a girl.

373
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,368
Take your son...

374
00:29:33,487 --> 00:29:36,029
...and tell him to learn
something from his son.

375
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:37,911
He's a godly child.

376
00:29:38,522 --> 00:29:40,297
He always minds his own business.

377
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:42,552
He is in love with Saraswati.

378
00:29:43,207 --> 00:29:45,182
What?
- I'm talking about the book.

379
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:48,019
Saraswati. He loves the college too.

380
00:29:48,324 --> 00:29:49,798
He loves his mother too.

381
00:29:49,946 --> 00:29:51,353
He loves his father too.

382
00:29:51,537 --> 00:29:53,000
He loves his neighbors too.
- Okay.

383
00:29:53,517 --> 00:29:55,593
I am done. I will leave.
She must be waiting for me.

384
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:03,443
Any problem?
- Sir, actually...

385
00:30:03,617 --> 00:30:05,483
I'm happy that I know all the answers.

386
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:08,094
I couldn't control my happiness,
so I am crying.

387
00:30:08,903 --> 00:30:11,283
Do well. All the best.
- Sure, sir.

388
00:30:11,862 --> 00:30:13,580
Why are you crying?

389
00:30:15,243 --> 00:30:17,510
Even I prepared for the same paper.

390
00:30:17,829 --> 00:30:19,168
But everything got ruined.

391
00:30:19,437 --> 00:30:20,659
I knew this!

392
00:30:21,006 --> 00:30:23,971
I had already warned you
to stay away from that loafer.

393
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,385
Is he the only villain in the city?

394
00:30:25,465 --> 00:30:26,830
Even I am a villain.
Dial his number and give it to me.

395
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:29,836
Hello?
- Hello, Kumar!

396
00:30:30,056 --> 00:30:32,132
It is better you
return the money to us.

397
00:30:32,628 --> 00:30:34,186
You don't know me yet.

398
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:36,206
Tell me where you are,
I will come there.

399
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:39,262
Girls shouldn't come in such places.

400
00:30:39,342 --> 00:30:40,183
What's the matter, tell me.

401
00:30:40,353 --> 00:30:43,434
Do you think girls are
weak and they'll sit and cry?

402
00:30:43,749 --> 00:30:45,924
I am not Lakshmi's fan to sit and cry.

403
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,657
I am Phoolan Devi's fan.

404
00:30:47,983 --> 00:30:50,183
Hey, who do you think you are?
- Give the phone to me.

405
00:30:51,062 --> 00:30:53,276
Sorry, bro. I beg of you.

406
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,742
Please try to understand.

407
00:30:54,822 --> 00:30:57,555
If I fail this time,
my parents will get me married.

408
00:30:57,849 --> 00:30:59,654
Please don't feel bad for what she said.

409
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:01,038
Please.
- What did I tell him?

410
00:31:01,118 --> 00:31:02,604
Please help us.

411
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:04,031
Okay, what is it?

412
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,996
Promise me that you'll meet me.

413
00:31:08,554 --> 00:31:10,629
I can't promise you right now.

414
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:11,848
Do this...

415
00:31:12,126 --> 00:31:15,641
...come to the Lord
Anjaneya temple at 8:00.

416
00:31:15,746 --> 00:31:17,831
I will do your work. Okay?

417
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:19,593
Hello, one moment.

418
00:31:19,673 --> 00:31:22,524
Please get Phoolan Devi along.

419
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:26,257
What did he say?
- He asked me to get Phoolan Devi along.

420
00:31:26,775 --> 00:31:27,939
Phoolan Devi?

421
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:32,817
I feel he's going to cheat us.

422
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,867
If he doesn't come today,
tomorrow you see...

423
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:36,943
What happened?

424
00:31:38,643 --> 00:31:39,557
The villain is here.

425
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:44,337
Hello girls, you've come here on time.

426
00:31:44,493 --> 00:31:46,477
Return the money, don't talk too much.

427
00:31:46,557 --> 00:31:47,778
Sir, actually...
- Hey!

428
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:49,588
Your father will
get you married, right?

429
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:51,474
Don't repeat the same thing again.

430
00:31:52,213 --> 00:31:54,620
Mr. Kumar...
- He's like a God to you.

431
00:31:54,756 --> 00:31:57,045
Kumar, you keep dealing with people.

432
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,392
You called me to the temple.
- Not me, she did.

433
00:31:59,702 --> 00:32:01,141
Couldn't you recognize
seeing her face?

434
00:32:01,805 --> 00:32:03,899
Just see what she has written.

435
00:32:04,338 --> 00:32:07,327
'Lord Raghavendra, do anything
You want to do with me...'

436
00:32:07,446 --> 00:32:10,645
'...but I have an ailing mother,
drunkard father, and jobless brother.'

437
00:32:10,725 --> 00:32:12,710
'My friend is a fool...'

438
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,305
'...I have to take care of everyone.
- What?'

439
00:32:14,744 --> 00:32:17,721
'I had trusted someone,
but he betrayed me.'

440
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:20,842
'You're my only hope now.
Please, make me pass the exams.'

441
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:22,004
Take this!

442
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:23,991
Hey, you write.

443
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:26,925
What do you want, order it.

444
00:32:27,384 --> 00:32:29,034
Have you brought me to Coffee Day...

445
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,612
...for me to order anything?
- Wait.

446
00:32:30,692 --> 00:32:31,520
Give me two coffees.

447
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:38,772
This coffee tastes better
than Coffee Day's coffee.

448
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:40,249
Have it. Cheers.

449
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,298
Why are you saying cheers?

450
00:32:46,034 --> 00:32:47,816
Aren't you serious about life?

451
00:32:47,955 --> 00:32:50,207
Are you always like this?
- Yes.

452
00:32:50,506 --> 00:32:51,879
People who are with
me are also like me.

453
00:32:52,443 --> 00:32:55,515
People like me the way I am.
I am not a hypocrite.

454
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:58,283
Few people call me villain.

455
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:00,099
Why should I feel bad?

456
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:05,340
Buddy, we'll meet up at Ganesha temple
tomorrow. I've prepared the papers.

457
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,538
Okay.

458
00:33:07,704 --> 00:33:09,447
Do you think the invigilating
squad will come here?

459
00:33:09,652 --> 00:33:11,008
Look into the book and write soon.

460
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:13,650
Sir, I am done.
- Hurry up.

461
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,304
How long are you taking.
- Are you done?

462
00:33:15,736 --> 00:33:17,180
Give that to me.
- Okay.

463
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:18,936
We'll meet tomorrow. Okay?
- Okay.

464
00:33:20,203 --> 00:33:23,963
Sir, it's late. Will you drop us home?

465
00:33:24,456 --> 00:33:25,376
Shut up.

466
00:33:25,456 --> 00:33:26,946
Is this a special duty to me?
- Please.

467
00:33:32,681 --> 00:33:33,932
Stop it here.

468
00:33:40,828 --> 00:33:42,599
Thank you so much. This is my house.

469
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:45,414
My so called sister,
this is not a house, but a bank.

470
00:33:45,494 --> 00:33:48,400
Look there.
- I mean, my house is behind this.

471
00:33:48,566 --> 00:33:49,740
You call me as brother...

472
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,310
...why do you hesitate to show
me your house? You have to trust boys.

473
00:33:54,112 --> 00:33:56,359
Okay, sir. Bye. Bye, dear.
- Be careful.

474
00:33:56,586 --> 00:33:58,053
Bye.
- Where is your house?

475
00:33:58,296 --> 00:33:59,580
Library or pub?

476
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,755
Not library or pub,
I have a house, come.

477
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:06,654
Stop! Bring your bike to aside.

478
00:34:06,853 --> 00:34:08,799
What is your name?
- Kumar.

479
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,145
Have you taken anything?
- Yes.

480
00:34:11,225 --> 00:34:12,251
Wait, I will come.

481
00:34:13,254 --> 00:34:15,557
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
What will you do now?

482
00:34:15,765 --> 00:34:17,197
Blow for 10 seconds.

483
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,105
Blow again.

484
00:34:26,184 --> 00:34:28,293
Tell me the truth.
Have you taken anything?

485
00:34:28,373 --> 00:34:29,694
Yes, sir.

486
00:34:29,774 --> 00:34:33,506
What is your problem?
- Sir, he says he has taken...

487
00:34:33,647 --> 00:34:35,241
...the machine is not working...

488
00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:36,782
...it is not showing the reading, sir.

489
00:34:37,322 --> 00:34:40,391
Have you taken anything?
- He asked me if I have taken...

490
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:42,658
...here it is, I will go home and drink.

491
00:34:42,738 --> 00:34:44,404
Do you have any problem?

492
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,088
Why do you do this all the time?

493
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:50,018
You are also wasting my time.

494
00:34:50,128 --> 00:34:51,740
Let's go.
- There's something wrong.

495
00:34:53,423 --> 00:34:55,786
Do you always carry
liquor in your pocket?

496
00:34:56,123 --> 00:34:58,762
I actually bought it for my friend.

497
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:00,840
Oh. Do you drink every day?

498
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,324
Don't you like guys who drink?

499
00:35:03,864 --> 00:35:05,122
Nothing as such.

500
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:10,757
Boys should drink liquor
and smoke cigarette. It's okay.

501
00:35:13,186 --> 00:35:14,536
My house is ahead.

502
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:16,955
People will mistake us
if I dropped you in front of your house.

503
00:35:17,674 --> 00:35:18,698
Okay.

504
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,813
So, you are also a good guy?

505
00:35:21,604 --> 00:35:24,054
Do you want to say anything else?

506
00:35:25,105 --> 00:35:27,824
Nothing.
- Okay. Bye.

507
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:33,900
Can you meet me tomorrow?

508
00:35:34,156 --> 00:35:35,775
I want to talk to you.

509
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,392
I was wondering
if you want to say something...

510
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:39,899
...even my bike is not starting.

511
00:35:41,742 --> 00:35:44,481
If you turn the key,
the bike will start.

512
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:47,194
Bye.

513
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,033
One coffee!

514
00:35:59,187 --> 00:36:00,449
Hi.
- Hi.

515
00:36:01,335 --> 00:36:02,779
You said you want to say something?

516
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:06,610
Well, when I was in 10th grade...

517
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,162
...a guy stalked me badly.

518
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:11,942
So?
- I went to beat him last year...

519
00:36:12,595 --> 00:36:14,620
...but he had become a bodybuilder.

520
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:17,266
I want to beat him.

521
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,369
Coffee cancel, give me energy drink.

522
00:36:20,067 --> 00:36:20,825
Just a minute.

523
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:24,412
Boys, be ready with the weapons...

524
00:36:24,611 --> 00:36:25,602
...there's a brawl in the evening.

525
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,780
I want to beat him,
you just come with me.

526
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,034
Drink it. You need strength.

527
00:36:32,288 --> 00:36:33,838
Boost is the secret of your energy.

528
00:36:41,777 --> 00:36:44,041
Hey, are you here to have snacks?

529
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:47,117
No, I am here to beat you.
- You will beat me?

530
00:36:51,246 --> 00:36:53,455
Have you brought him to beat me?

531
00:36:53,605 --> 00:36:56,420
Brother, I am here just
to watch and not beat you.

532
00:36:57,294 --> 00:36:58,077
Just a minute.

533
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,292
You needn't seek my blessings.

534
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,427
Bless me.

535
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:34,897
Sorry for destroying the tomatoes.

536
00:37:34,977 --> 00:37:38,856
Never mind, beat him to pulp,
he harasses girls a lot.

537
00:37:52,425 --> 00:37:55,752
Drink tender coconut and
then continue beating him, take it.

538
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:57,256
Okay. Thank you.

539
00:38:00,377 --> 00:38:03,413
That girl will beat you
and you must get beaten up.

540
00:38:03,493 --> 00:38:06,155
If you resist, I will kill you.

541
00:38:20,248 --> 00:38:22,006
Hello! Excuse me!

542
00:38:24,538 --> 00:38:26,518
'Four men have been hospitalised...'

543
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:30,005
'...and two have been battling for life...'

544
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:32,738
'...but the doctor said they
will die by tomorrow morning.'

545
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:35,603
Why are you late?
- 'In public that day...'

546
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:37,174
'...five goons...'
- Stop it.

547
00:38:37,254 --> 00:38:38,624
'...you were laughing though they
were destroying your auto rickshaw.'

548
00:38:38,704 --> 00:38:39,969
What's the matter with her?

549
00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:42,313
She's mischievous.
- 'They say that...'

550
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:44,597
'...only an expert can fight...'

551
00:38:44,677 --> 00:38:49,045
'...with such tremendous
skillfully with the enemies.'

552
00:38:56,302 --> 00:38:57,789
Hello.
- Tell me.

553
00:38:57,962 --> 00:39:00,488
Where are you?
I want to hug you immediately.

554
00:39:00,568 --> 00:39:01,837
You want to hug me?

555
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:07,883
As you please, met me at the complex.
- Bye.

556
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:22,288

But you have written Rs 3500 here.

566
00:43:43,764 --> 00:43:45,226
Rs 3500.

567
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:47,198

00:43:55,576 --> 00:43:57,022
Mom...
- Girija. - Yes.

573
00:43:57,596 --> 00:43:59,443
I have been watching you...

574
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:02,315
...you seeing the board.
What's the matter?

575
00:44:02,395 --> 00:44:04,363
How is possible? I was there.

576
00:44:04,495 --> 00:44:06,349
Okay.
- Girija.

577
00:44:06,737 --> 00:44:09,443
I gave you Rs 22000...

578
00:44:09,791 --> 00:44:13,395
...you have written Rs 21100.
- That's right.

579
00:44:13,594 --> 00:44:16,062
Where is the remaining money?

580
00:44:16,142 --> 00:44:18,665
Why do you ask me?
It should be somewhere there.

581
00:44:18,745 --> 00:44:20,499
I am asking you because
I don't find it.

582
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:21,589
What do you mean?

583
00:44:21,756 --> 00:44:23,571
You think I took the money?

584
00:44:23,651 --> 00:44:25,878
As if I am the only one in this house.
- What do you mean?

585
00:44:26,237 --> 00:44:27,699
Should I suspect my son?

586
00:44:28,004 --> 00:44:29,669
He a good son.

587
00:44:29,749 --> 00:44:31,385
There is no chance that
he could steal the money.

588
00:44:31,465 --> 00:44:32,812
What do you mean?

589
00:44:32,892 --> 00:44:34,793
You are sure that
I have taken the money.

590
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:38,037
Not me, the accounts says so,
try to understand.

591
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,519
Okay, bring it.

592
00:44:40,658 --> 00:44:41,986
She will bring the money.

593
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:44,601
She will bring it.

594
00:44:45,715 --> 00:44:47,666
Come here.

595
00:44:48,441 --> 00:44:50,115
Give that to me.

596
00:44:50,565 --> 00:44:51,686
She got caught.

597
00:44:55,749 --> 00:44:59,607
It is Rs. 900. You've been wearing
torn clothes from past one year.

598
00:45:00,305 --> 00:45:01,323
So, I bought this.

599
00:45:02,004 --> 00:45:04,207
Dad, she loves you very much.

600
00:45:05,708 --> 00:45:07,666
Girija, why are you in a haste?

601
00:45:08,463 --> 00:45:11,418
If he studies hard for one more year,
he will become a big officer.

602
00:45:12,055 --> 00:45:15,525
He will buy you a Mysore silk sari...

603
00:45:16,261 --> 00:45:18,005
...and a Mysore turban for me.

604
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:20,340
Kumar, what say?
- Yes, Dad.

605
00:45:20,595 --> 00:45:23,191
Mom, I'll not only get you a Mysore silk,
but will make you the queen of Mysore.

606
00:45:23,271 --> 00:45:24,769
Smile a little. Come on.

607
00:45:25,968 --> 00:45:27,093
Smile.

608
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:36,116
Buddy, do you have money?

609
00:45:36,581 --> 00:45:37,715
Buddy, I don't have any money.

610
00:45:37,795 --> 00:45:39,000
We have to pay the balance amount.
What do we do now?

611
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:39,930
One moment.

612
00:45:40,476 --> 00:45:41,795
Mr. Ahmed,
how much do I have to pay you?

613
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:44,015
Should I tell you only today's bill
amount or including the previous one?

614
00:45:44,095 --> 00:45:46,008
Wait, I will give it to him.

615
00:45:47,095 --> 00:45:50,141
Do you think I am a pauper?
I am a jinx?

616
00:45:50,858 --> 00:45:53,721
Just wearing good clothes
won't make you a rich man.

617
00:45:53,801 --> 00:45:55,360
Hi.
- Hello, Kumar. Where are you?

618
00:45:55,568 --> 00:45:56,527
I'm at the tea stall.

619
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,584
My parents have found out
about our affair.

620
00:45:58,979 --> 00:46:00,550
Come soon.
- Shall I get ready and come?

621
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,031
Don't get ready. Come right away.

622
00:46:02,111 --> 00:46:03,573
Okay.
- Where?

623
00:46:03,653 --> 00:46:05,187
Come on, let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

624
00:46:05,267 --> 00:46:06,354
I don't want your money.

625
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:07,754
Who do you think you are?

626
00:46:09,096 --> 00:46:09,922
Why are you going to
your father-in-law's house?

627
00:46:10,002 --> 00:46:11,089
To ask for her alliance.

628
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,143
Go inside. All the best.

629
00:46:13,223 --> 00:46:15,406
I'm going to her house
for the first time. God, help me.

630
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,851
Had you kept a piece of
tomato on this semolina bread...

631
00:46:20,212 --> 00:46:22,105
...it would've tasted better.
- You're too much.

632
00:46:22,185 --> 00:46:23,732
Let it be, tomatoes
are very expensive these days.

633
00:46:24,873 --> 00:46:25,808
Sir, greetings.

634
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:27,850
Who are you?

635
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:31,549
I... sir, can I sit?
- Okay.

636
00:46:32,928 --> 00:46:35,585
Sir, my name is Kumar.
My house is in the nearby area.

637
00:46:35,783 --> 00:46:37,089
I'm studying final year B.com.

638
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:39,502
I will become an independent
auditor in the next three years.

639
00:46:39,901 --> 00:46:41,761
Sir, I'm doing this for my father.

640
00:46:41,954 --> 00:46:43,321
Actually...
- Hey!

641
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:47,644
Why did you put more
garlic in the chutney?

642
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:49,202
Do you know how expensive garlic is?

643
00:46:49,282 --> 00:46:50,420
You...

644
00:46:51,169 --> 00:46:52,223
You continue.

645
00:46:52,303 --> 00:46:54,564
Sir, my aim is
to become a big business man.

646
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:59,139
Sir, I wish to own a bungalow,
car in the next five years.

647
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:01,991
Sir, it's difficult to
find a girl while working hard.

648
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:03,408
You're right. It's difficult.

649
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,207
Eloping with a girl...

650
00:47:05,528 --> 00:47:07,205
...and marrying against
her parents' wishes...

651
00:47:07,793 --> 00:47:08,861
...sir, this is all old style.

652
00:47:08,941 --> 00:47:11,041
Yes. - So, I want to get
committed to your daughter.

653
00:47:13,195 --> 00:47:14,506
What is he saying?

654
00:47:15,453 --> 00:47:17,504
You stay quiet.
You continue.

655
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,936
If I love a girl, even her family
members should like me.

656
00:47:20,016 --> 00:47:21,164
That's my policy.

657
00:47:21,683 --> 00:47:23,672
Sir, I love your daughter...

658
00:47:23,897 --> 00:47:26,916
...obviously,
I will love you as well as your wife.

659
00:47:30,963 --> 00:47:33,272
You can love everyone later,
first tell me what brings you here?

660
00:47:33,748 --> 00:47:35,054
Sir, actually...

661
00:47:35,134 --> 00:47:38,021
Please don't torture the girl.

662
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:41,913
I don't like it.
Let's discuss it face to face.

663
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:45,710
I don't know who you are.

664
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,157
I'm seeing you for the first time.

665
00:47:48,694 --> 00:47:50,467
Why will I torture my daughter?

666
00:47:50,905 --> 00:47:54,102
Who called you here?
- Sir, actually...

667
00:47:54,759 --> 00:47:55,755
Hey!

668
00:47:57,679 --> 00:47:59,692
Ours is a very cultured family.

669
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:02,273
You shouldn't come
into the house like this.

670
00:48:03,062 --> 00:48:04,889
If you repeat this again...

671
00:48:05,775 --> 00:48:07,048
...my reaction will be different.

672
00:48:08,156 --> 00:48:09,030
You may leave now.

673
00:48:09,537 --> 00:48:11,256
Sorry, sir. Sorry, ma'am.

674
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:18,977
She's too much,
I will teach her a lesson.

675
00:48:19,127 --> 00:48:20,643
Did everything go on well?

676
00:48:21,152 --> 00:48:22,901
Hey, come on, let's go.
- Why do you look upset?

677
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:27,879
Hello, why won't he pay the money?

678
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:29,948
I will thrash him and
recover the money from him.

679
00:48:30,888 --> 00:48:32,500
Keep an eye on him,
I will be there in 10 minutes.

680
00:48:35,531 --> 00:48:37,856
Hey, what are you watching?
What's your problem?

681
00:48:40,222 --> 00:48:41,461
Hey fatso, take a right.

682
00:48:42,143 --> 00:48:42,979
Okay, buddy.

683
00:48:45,392 --> 00:48:47,058
Oh no.

684
00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:48,775
Why did you stop?

685
00:48:48,855 --> 00:48:49,842
Didn't you put petrol?
- I had put it.

686
00:48:49,922 --> 00:48:51,292
Somebody stole it in the parking lot.

687
00:48:51,372 --> 00:48:52,533
I know you are lying.
You didn't put petrol.

688
00:48:52,613 --> 00:48:55,481
Don't hit me. I was famished,
so I had masala dosa.

689
00:48:55,665 --> 00:48:57,922
I don't have money,
you're torturing me.

690
00:48:58,546 --> 00:49:00,278
He is calling me constantly.

691
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,665
You...
- God, save me from him.

692
00:49:02,745 --> 00:49:06,014
Hello, sir... stop.
- Stop.

693
00:49:06,429 --> 00:49:08,478
Sir, will you drop me
till the petrol bunk?

694
00:49:08,793 --> 00:49:10,215
What do you do?

695
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:12,889
Why do you want to know about me?

696
00:49:12,969 --> 00:49:14,837
I thought you were a student.
So, I asked you.

697
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,349
Sir, no one has succeeded studying.

698
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:20,111
Why are you bothering?
Look ahead and drive.

699
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:23,309
What do you do for a living?

700
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:24,544
You've asked the right question now.

701
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:26,117
I do all illegal businesses.

702
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:27,810
If you have a problem tell me,
I will get it done.

703
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:28,824
Okay.

704
00:49:29,603 --> 00:49:30,688
Stop here.

705
00:49:31,817 --> 00:49:33,765
Sir, thanks a lot.

706
00:49:33,935 --> 00:49:36,048
It would be of great
help had you given me Rs. 100.

707
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,112
I forgot my purse at home.

708
00:49:38,362 --> 00:49:40,954
If you give me Rs. 100,
I will repay it to you tomorrow.

709
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:47,005
Sir, you're a very nice man.

710
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:50,628
We're getting petrol only because
of people like you exist on earth.

711
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:52,289
Sir, please show me your face.

712
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:54,988
I will feel very happy. Sir, please.

713
00:49:59,821 --> 00:50:02,649
I thought you were a nice guy
when you came home and spoke to me.

714
00:50:03,845 --> 00:50:05,837
I found out about you from people...

715
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,730
...you're really a great man.

716
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:08,691
Sir, actually...

717
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:11,461
A human being shouldn't
wish for more than he can have.

718
00:50:11,904 --> 00:50:13,332
You're a cheap guy.

719
00:50:13,481 --> 00:50:15,169
You need not repay me the money.

720
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:18,464
You can use this money
to buy liquor at night.

721
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,859
Sir, actually...
- Go away.

722
00:50:27,413 --> 00:50:28,267
Oh no!

723
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:37,477
Kumar, what is it? Just say it.

724
00:50:37,754 --> 00:50:40,438
My father-in-law insulted
me by giving me Rs. 100.

725
00:50:40,518 --> 00:50:43,372
It's okay, cool, bro.
- You return that money to him.

726
00:50:43,452 --> 00:50:44,484
That's it.
- Hey...

727
00:50:44,564 --> 00:50:48,879
Buddy, call someone in your village
and tell them to send Rs. 2000.

728
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,142
Is that all?

729
00:50:50,222 --> 00:50:52,153
I'm a very decent
man before I get drunk...

730
00:50:52,233 --> 00:50:54,607
...but after I get drunk, I am the king.

731
00:50:58,271 --> 00:51:00,253
Hello, dad!
- 'What is it?'

732
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:01,882
I have a kingfisher exam.

733
00:51:01,962 --> 00:51:03,439
Send me Rs. 2000 at the earliest.

734
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:05,536
'I had sent you Rs. 5000 last month.'

735
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:07,993
This is a signature exam.

736
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:09,895
'Is it?'
- Do I have to tell you all this?

737
00:51:09,975 --> 00:51:11,211
Dad, send me the
money at the earliest.

738
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:13,469
'How can I send if
you ask me suddenly?'

739
00:51:13,549 --> 00:51:16,175
I've informed the shopkeeper
in our neighborhood.

740
00:51:16,462 --> 00:51:18,357
He will transfer it through Paytm,
you give the money to him.

741
00:51:18,437 --> 00:51:21,989
'Okay, I will give it to him.'
- Dad, I have a lot to study.

742
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:24,667
Dad, I will hang up now. Good night.
- 'Study well, my son.'

743
00:51:24,747 --> 00:51:27,372
Sweet dreams.
- 'You idiot, hang up the phone.'

744
00:51:28,337 --> 00:51:31,959
People of Singanayak
village has developed so much.

745
00:51:34,214 --> 00:51:37,378
Buddy, our villagers are no less.

746
00:51:37,498 --> 00:51:39,099
Superb.
- They are fast in everything.

747
00:51:39,268 --> 00:51:41,444
Buddy, shall we go to
our father-in-law's house?

748
00:51:41,925 --> 00:51:43,969
He's my father-in-law.

749
00:51:44,247 --> 00:51:46,717
Sorry, buddy. I said it wrong.
- Bheema...

750
00:51:47,121 --> 00:51:49,644
...until we return,
take care of these things.

751
00:51:49,724 --> 00:51:51,152
We will return and drink it.

752
00:51:54,766 --> 00:51:57,492
This is our father-in-law's house.
He's kept the lights on.

753
00:51:58,331 --> 00:51:59,621
Go straight inside.

754
00:52:01,436 --> 00:52:02,888
Hi, father-in-law.
- Hello, friend.

755
00:52:08,281 --> 00:52:10,252
You gave me Rs. 100
and I returned Rs. 500 to you.

756
00:52:10,438 --> 00:52:12,094
You give me Rs. 100
and I will give Rs. 500 to you.

757
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:13,767
You give me your daughter,
I will give love to her.

758
00:52:13,847 --> 00:52:14,896
That's my capacity.

759
00:52:14,976 --> 00:52:17,101
Hey, I will call the police!

760
00:52:17,526 --> 00:52:20,301
Buddy, he's calling the police,
let's escape from here.

761
00:52:20,727 --> 00:52:22,819
He won't call the police.
- Right?

762
00:52:23,042 --> 00:52:26,556
Father-in-law, I am in a hurry.
I will leave, but will meet you often.

763
00:52:26,696 --> 00:52:27,808
You don't worry.

764
00:52:27,888 --> 00:52:30,402
You can call the police.
I shall leave. Okay, bye.

765
00:52:30,482 --> 00:52:32,377
Hey, idiot! Saroja!
- Let's go.

766
00:52:32,799 --> 00:52:34,008
Give me the phone.
- Father-in-law...

767
00:52:34,296 --> 00:52:36,443
I will call the police!
- Come on, let's go and get drunk.

768
00:52:37,142 --> 00:52:38,402
What are you doing?

769
00:52:40,238 --> 00:52:42,952
Don't apply breaks suddenly.

770
00:52:43,502 --> 00:52:44,490
Father-in-law!

771
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,975
Mother-in-law...
- He's not at home.

772
00:52:49,315 --> 00:52:52,205
We're drunk. We don't talk to ladies.
Please call my father-in-law.

773
00:52:52,285 --> 00:52:54,452
Hey, who is it? Why are you lying?

774
00:52:54,762 --> 00:52:56,710
Actually...
- You go inside.

775
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:58,725
Do anything you want.

776
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,222
Father-in-law,
I'm unable to forget you.

777
00:53:01,521 --> 00:53:04,133
I see your picture on
Rs. 100 instead of Gandhi's.

778
00:53:04,213 --> 00:53:07,278
So, I came to see you.
- Neighbors are watching.

779
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:10,997
Come inside and talk.

780
00:53:11,253 --> 00:53:13,141
That day we spoke inside the house.

781
00:53:13,445 --> 00:53:15,322
You insulted me in the public.

782
00:53:15,638 --> 00:53:16,961
Am I right, father-in-law?
- Hey!

783
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:19,214
Don't you dare address
me as father-in-law!

784
00:53:22,406 --> 00:53:24,682
So, shall I sing a song instead?

785
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:29,673
Come on, sing.
- "Father-in-law."

786
00:53:30,137 --> 00:53:32,531
"Father-in-law."

787
00:53:32,962 --> 00:53:36,486
"Father-in-law."
I shall leave now.

788
00:53:38,224 --> 00:53:39,558
Father-in-law, will you
get your daughter married to me?

789
00:53:43,049 --> 00:53:44,573
Father-in-law, will you
get your daughter married to me?

790
00:53:46,942 --> 00:53:48,608
Father-in-law!

791
00:53:48,688 --> 00:53:51,094
Hey, stop there!
- Father-in-law!

792
00:53:51,442 --> 00:53:52,927
They're calling me as father-in-law.

793
00:53:55,263 --> 00:53:56,577
Sir, will you give it or not?

794
00:53:57,227 --> 00:53:59,465
Hey, I won't get my
daughter married to you.

795
00:53:59,545 --> 00:54:01,394
Sir, I was asking about the garbage,
not your daughter.

796
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:02,622
Hey, go away!

797
00:54:04,222 --> 00:54:05,268
Father-in-law...

798
00:54:09,402 --> 00:54:12,315
It is me who has the rights
to call you as father-in-law.

799
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:15,180
But everyone is addressing
you as father-in-law.

800
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,373
Hey, I am not in mood. Get going.

801
00:54:17,453 --> 00:54:19,348
Father-in-law, you have to decide...

802
00:54:19,428 --> 00:54:21,062
...whether you'll get your
daughter married to me or not.

803
00:54:21,206 --> 00:54:23,649
Hey, don't address me as father-in-law
again and again. You idiot.

804
00:54:23,729 --> 00:54:25,517
What else do I call you as,
if not father-in-law?

805
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:27,510
Hey, what are you saying?
- Father-in-law, don't hit me.

806
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:29,917
Get going. Dare you come here again.
- Father-in-law, calm down.

807
00:54:30,982 --> 00:54:32,304
Dad, what's the matter?

808
00:54:33,577 --> 00:54:34,691
What else is left?

809
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,524
I am getting humiliated
because of you.

810
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:39,264
I beg of you, don't torture me.

811
00:54:40,786 --> 00:54:43,146
I always considered you as a son.

812
00:54:43,996 --> 00:54:45,961
You proved me wrong today.

813
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:48,500
Dad...

814
00:54:51,212 --> 00:54:52,208
Sorry, Dad.

815
00:54:53,799 --> 00:54:56,439
Excuse me, madam.
Please, do you have a matchbox?

816
00:54:59,678 --> 00:55:01,305
She gave you a lighter.

817
00:55:01,913 --> 00:55:03,175
I want to talk to you.

818
00:55:03,255 --> 00:55:04,182
What's wrong with her?

819
00:55:05,406 --> 00:55:07,426
Hey.
- I'll go ask her what it is.

820
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:10,259
Hey, didn't I tell you
they both will break up?

821
00:55:10,339 --> 00:55:11,986
Wait, they haven't broken up yet.

822
00:55:13,828 --> 00:55:14,776
What do you want to say?

823
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,503
Do you think what you
did yesterday was right?

824
00:55:17,884 --> 00:55:20,736
After going from your house,
I thought about it all night.

825
00:55:21,205 --> 00:55:22,493
I think I over did it.

826
00:55:22,865 --> 00:55:24,278
Please don't act too smart, okay!

827
00:55:24,628 --> 00:55:26,156
You got drunk and came home.

828
00:55:26,337 --> 00:55:27,927
Don't you feel ashamed?
- Hello!

829
00:55:28,498 --> 00:55:30,177
I didn't get drunk
and come to your house.

830
00:55:30,257 --> 00:55:31,996
I drank because I wanted
to come to your house.

831
00:55:32,076 --> 00:55:33,718
But your father
shouldn't have done that.

832
00:55:33,847 --> 00:55:35,578
Every daughter's father
acts the same way.

833
00:55:35,658 --> 00:55:38,207
At least,
my father behaved nicely with you.

834
00:55:38,287 --> 00:55:41,343
Hello, it was like stabbing
myself with a knife of love.

835
00:55:41,423 --> 00:55:43,083
Who told you to stab yourself?

836
00:55:44,481 --> 00:55:46,221
Okay, I played a prank with you.

837
00:55:46,753 --> 00:55:50,596
I never imagined that
you would act so cheap.

838
00:55:50,906 --> 00:55:53,529
Your father gave me Rs. 100
and said I was a useless guy.

839
00:55:53,723 --> 00:55:54,758
Who do you think you are?

840
00:55:55,726 --> 00:55:58,471
I am useless, you fell in love
with me, are you brainless?

841
00:55:58,637 --> 00:56:00,165
You humiliated me so much.

842
00:56:00,741 --> 00:56:02,639
You got drunk and
fought with my father...

843
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:04,814
...what's the guarantee that
you wouldn't hit me after marriage?

844
00:56:05,623 --> 00:56:07,455
I fell in love with a villain.

845
00:56:08,335 --> 00:56:09,702
You are really a villain.

846
00:56:10,455 --> 00:56:12,183
I am getting irritated
even to see you.

847
00:56:12,263 --> 00:56:14,579
Are you getting irritated?
You've said what you want to. Leave now!

848
00:56:15,128 --> 00:56:17,331
I came here to give this Rs. 500.

849
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:20,581
I don't take back
the money given in alms.

850
00:56:22,784 --> 00:56:26,190
You gave me nice respect
for falling in love with you.

851
00:56:27,029 --> 00:56:28,114
Thank you.

852
00:56:34,468 --> 00:56:37,970
Kumar, I called you here
to give you a final warning.

853
00:56:38,813 --> 00:56:41,573
No one will get the question paper.

854
00:56:41,967 --> 00:56:43,856
Digital examination
is fast approaching.

855
00:56:44,048 --> 00:56:46,423
You can't contact any evaluator.

856
00:56:46,609 --> 00:56:48,740
Even that is becoming digitalization.

857
00:56:49,169 --> 00:56:51,175
So, work hard and study.

858
00:56:51,535 --> 00:56:53,046
Write your exams sincerely.

859
00:56:53,195 --> 00:56:54,745
You'll at least pass.

860
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:57,215
First of all,
I am not that kind of a guy.

861
00:56:57,667 --> 00:56:59,119
Sir, I shall leave now. Sir!

862
00:57:00,985 --> 00:57:03,031
Thanks a lot for
giving me information.

863
00:57:03,111 --> 00:57:04,321
Sir, I shall leave.

864
00:57:07,538 --> 00:57:09,668
We somehow passed by dealing
the question paper last year.

865
00:57:09,748 --> 00:57:11,023
I heard there are new rules this time.

866
00:57:11,267 --> 00:57:12,325
What do we do now?

867
00:57:12,701 --> 00:57:14,911
I've enquired about it.

868
00:57:15,495 --> 00:57:16,731
Principal will get a mail.

869
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:18,555
It has to be opened with a password.

870
00:57:19,313 --> 00:57:21,976
The faculty takes the answer
sheets and distributes it to everyone.

871
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,120
Okay?

872
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:24,909
But do you know what the twist is?

873
00:57:25,029 --> 00:57:26,988
The answer sheets
come from the university...

874
00:57:27,098 --> 00:57:28,317
...there will be a barcode on it.

875
00:57:28,469 --> 00:57:30,467
They can't fool us this time.

876
00:57:30,594 --> 00:57:33,817
Shall I take a vow in front of God.
- Shut up.

877
00:57:33,897 --> 00:57:35,506
Tell me what to do.

878
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:36,931
I have an idea.

879
00:57:37,215 --> 00:57:39,858
'They'll give 5 answer
sheets extra with 100.'

880
00:57:40,031 --> 00:57:43,337
'We'll take those answer
sheets to the toilet and fill it.'

881
00:57:43,417 --> 00:57:46,478
'We have to replace it with our
answer sheet by evening 5 o'clock.'

882
00:57:46,558 --> 00:57:50,539
'Those answer sheets will be
disposed to the university directly.'

883
00:57:50,619 --> 00:57:52,366
Superb, buddy.
- Do you know what you have to do?

884
00:57:52,567 --> 00:57:54,055
You all have to arrange for money.

885
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:56,133
Buddy, here's my advance money.

886
00:57:56,213 --> 00:57:59,591
Buddy, if a guy like you
didn't exist in every college...

887
00:57:59,854 --> 00:58:01,958
...what will happen to students like us?

888
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:04,409
Buddy, you will become
very successful one day.

889
00:58:04,529 --> 00:58:07,747
Glory to College Kumar!

890
00:58:29,277 --> 00:58:31,259
Girija!

891
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:32,460
Girija!

892
00:58:35,068 --> 00:58:36,889
What happened?

893
00:58:37,564 --> 00:58:40,458
Girija, I saw a dream that
my son has become a big officer.

894
00:58:41,687 --> 00:58:44,206
He went to office in style.

895
00:58:44,986 --> 00:58:47,903
Everyone was wishing him
good morning in the office.

896
00:58:48,782 --> 00:58:50,902
He was sitting on the office chair.

897
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:54,128
I am so happy to see him like this.

898
00:58:55,169 --> 00:58:56,542
I suddenly woke up.

899
00:58:56,875 --> 00:58:58,552
Do you know something?
- What?

900
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,557
People say morning dreams come true.
- Is it?

901
00:59:01,775 --> 00:59:04,687
Our son will surely become an officer.
- Oh, sure. God.

902
00:59:04,864 --> 00:59:06,652
Go to sleep now.
- Girija, it is time.

903
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:09,752
For what?
- I will go and wake him up.

904
00:59:10,483 --> 00:59:13,063
It's just 4:30.
Let he sleep for some time.

905
00:59:13,143 --> 00:59:14,474
He has his exams today.

906
00:59:14,734 --> 00:59:19,135
I will make him a strong coffee.
His sleep will vanish.

907
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,159
He will study well
and become a big officer.

908
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:22,908
Come on, let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

909
00:59:34,376 --> 00:59:35,307
Kumar.

910
00:59:37,376 --> 00:59:38,371
Kumar.

911
00:59:40,149 --> 00:59:41,153
Wake up, son.

912
00:59:41,706 --> 00:59:43,256
Dad, what is it?

913
00:59:43,477 --> 00:59:44,906
You have accounts exam today.

914
00:59:44,986 --> 00:59:46,370
It is already late.
- Dad.

915
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:49,998
Dad, I was reading all night.
I just went to sleep.

916
00:59:50,078 --> 00:59:54,080
Oh, that's the reason
I've made a strong coffee for you.

917
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,321
What say?

918
00:59:55,643 --> 00:59:58,937
Drink this and study well. Good boy.
- You leave.

919
00:59:59,421 --> 01:00:01,324
You should study well.
- You leave.

920
01:00:46,506 --> 01:00:49,306
How long will you write?
- Wait, I'm writing.

921
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,079
Hey, why are you hurrying?

922
01:00:52,289 --> 01:00:53,828
They have given questions
out of syllabus.

923
01:00:54,277 --> 01:00:55,437
Hey, idiot!

924
01:00:56,636 --> 01:00:58,212
They are asking me for answers.

925
01:00:59,421 --> 01:01:01,537
Bangari, are you free in the afternoon?
- No.

926
01:01:01,656 --> 01:01:02,905
Hey, I want to write.
- Pick it up.

927
01:01:02,985 --> 01:01:04,836
Hey, come on, let's go.
- Enough.

928
01:01:05,685 --> 01:01:07,274
Hey, let's go.

929
01:01:07,354 --> 01:01:09,145
Tell me the answer for first...
- Hey...

930
01:01:15,096 --> 01:01:15,950
Thank God.

931
01:01:20,561 --> 01:01:21,914
Hey, where's the second sheet?

932
01:01:22,074 --> 01:01:23,444
What's the answer for eighth question?

933
01:01:25,006 --> 01:01:26,536
I've attempted all the questions.

934
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:28,775
The invigilator should get
confused when giving marks to me.

935
01:01:30,415 --> 01:01:32,349
Is someone around?

936
01:01:33,128 --> 01:01:35,396
I don't know the answer.
Someone please tell me the answer.

937
01:01:35,861 --> 01:01:37,726
Someone, please tell it to me.

938
01:01:38,767 --> 01:01:39,868
Hey!

939
01:01:40,604 --> 01:01:42,464
Who is it?
- Who are you?

940
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:43,770
Hey, come out.

941
01:01:47,307 --> 01:01:48,531
Are you copying?
- Who are you?

942
01:01:48,681 --> 01:01:51,335
Which class are you in? Idiot!
- What do you want?

943
01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:55,720
How dare you hit the squad.
- Squad?

944
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,885
How dare you!

945
01:01:57,054 --> 01:01:59,041
I will show you who I am.
- Sir...

946
01:01:59,202 --> 01:02:00,396
Calm down, sir.
- Calm down?

947
01:02:00,476 --> 01:02:01,593
Let's settle things here.
- What is it?

948
01:02:01,673 --> 01:02:02,653
How dare you want to
settle things with me.

949
01:02:02,733 --> 01:02:03,492
Sir, please listen to me.

950
01:02:03,572 --> 01:02:04,281
Sir...

951
01:02:15,339 --> 01:02:17,353
Sir, please...
- I will teach you a lesson.

952
01:02:17,575 --> 01:02:19,938
Sir, please stop. One moment.

953
01:02:21,078 --> 01:02:22,949
Look, I learnt the matter.

954
01:02:23,503 --> 01:02:24,937
Hand him over to me, I will take care.

955
01:02:25,285 --> 01:02:27,207
Sir, I wouldn't have
bothered had he just copied...

956
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:28,978
...but he hit me.
- Sorry, sir.

957
01:02:29,058 --> 01:02:32,557
I will debar him right away.
- Sir, please.

958
01:02:32,637 --> 01:02:34,443
Please sir, my life will get ruined.
- You idiot, don't talk.

959
01:02:34,523 --> 01:02:36,254
I have been warning you.

960
01:02:36,488 --> 01:02:38,087
You made the same mistake again.

961
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:38,916
Sir...

962
01:02:38,996 --> 01:02:40,939
Sir, it is a matter
of our college prestige.

963
01:02:41,019 --> 01:02:43,588
Mr. Suresh, hand him
over to the police right away.

964
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:46,154
I will talk to the inspector.
Take him away.

965
01:02:46,234 --> 01:02:48,167
Sir, listen to me. My future...
- What does he say?

966
01:02:48,247 --> 01:02:50,426
Sir, please come inside.

967
01:02:50,636 --> 01:02:52,839
I understand...
- Sir, please don't hit me.

968
01:02:52,919 --> 01:02:54,067
Sir, don't hit me.
- Ramaiah.

969
01:02:54,147 --> 01:02:55,828
Yes, sir.
- Call his father.

970
01:02:55,908 --> 01:02:57,195
He isn't giving me his number.

971
01:02:58,324 --> 01:02:59,394
Why?

972
01:02:59,474 --> 01:03:01,069
Sir, don't ask me for the number.
- Then?

973
01:03:01,412 --> 01:03:02,575
You tell me a good number.

974
01:03:03,038 --> 01:03:04,191
I will finalize the deal here.

975
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:07,951
Deal?

976
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:11,538
You fraudster!
How dare you talk about deal to me.

977
01:03:12,109 --> 01:03:14,114
I thought I will call your parents here...

978
01:03:14,194 --> 01:03:15,654
...so that they can make you see sense,
but you think you're a businessman?

979
01:03:15,847 --> 01:03:18,642
Sir, he has made a lot
of money by dealing in papers.

980
01:03:18,722 --> 01:03:23,403
Your parents send you to the college
to study, but you misuse their leniency.

981
01:03:23,726 --> 01:03:28,537
I will teach you a lesson
before the entire area. Come on!

982
01:03:34,404 --> 01:03:37,116
Sir, please tell
the inspector not to go.

983
01:03:37,262 --> 01:03:38,228
Sir, tell him not to go to my house.

984
01:03:38,308 --> 01:03:40,175
Hey, get down!
- Hey, come out!

985
01:03:43,787 --> 01:03:44,908
Sir...
- You!

986
01:03:45,357 --> 01:03:46,595
Sir...
- Come on!

987
01:03:47,418 --> 01:03:49,576
Call your parents! Hey, come here.

988
01:03:51,187 --> 01:03:52,150
Police?

989
01:03:52,681 --> 01:03:56,778
Kumar, oh my God,
what happened to you?

990
01:03:56,858 --> 01:03:58,908
What happened to you?
- How can he tell you what happened to him?

991
01:03:58,988 --> 01:04:00,835
He is a cheater...
- Sir, don't hit him.

992
01:04:00,915 --> 01:04:02,484
He had to be in jail for 10 years.

993
01:04:02,888 --> 01:04:04,527
Your time is good.

994
01:04:04,914 --> 01:04:06,558
I'm just warning him.

995
01:04:06,714 --> 01:04:10,927
Once again if he gets into any case...

996
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,655
...I will not spare him.
- Sir...

997
01:04:12,735 --> 01:04:14,443
I will ruin your future!

998
01:04:15,301 --> 01:04:16,519
Make him see sense.

999
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:21,029
Oh...
- What happened?

1000
01:04:21,826 --> 01:04:22,628
What happened?

1001
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:24,195
Mom, please don't tell this to dad.

1002
01:04:24,523 --> 01:04:26,242
Why did the police bring you?

1003
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:28,380
Mom, nothing happened.
- Why?

1004
01:04:28,705 --> 01:04:30,421
Why are you standing quiet? Tell me.

1005
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:33,645
He told me to make you see sense.
What have you done?

1006
01:04:34,268 --> 01:04:36,150
Your dad is here.

1007
01:04:43,164 --> 01:04:44,752
What do I tell him?

1008
01:04:47,495 --> 01:04:49,724
Girija, what's the matter?

1009
01:04:49,804 --> 01:04:51,982
Why is everyone standing here?
- Listen...

1010
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:53,527
The police was here.

1011
01:04:54,389 --> 01:04:56,991
What happened, tell me, Girija!

1012
01:04:58,457 --> 01:04:59,597
Listen...
- Girija, what happened!

1013
01:04:59,677 --> 01:05:00,583
Dad!

1014
01:05:00,754 --> 01:05:01,889
Why are you asking her?

1015
01:05:03,355 --> 01:05:04,885
I didn't go to any college.

1016
01:05:05,196 --> 01:05:06,317
I can't study!

1017
01:05:06,518 --> 01:05:09,755
I got caught by the
squad during my examination.

1018
01:05:10,385 --> 01:05:12,773
Police arrested me
and brought me here.

1019
01:05:16,659 --> 01:05:17,594
Principal debarred me.

1020
01:05:42,884 --> 01:05:46,582
What did you say?
- Yes, I got debarred.

1021
01:05:47,512 --> 01:05:49,090
How dare you raise your voice?

1022
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:51,303
How dare you!
- Mom, go away!

1023
01:05:51,383 --> 01:05:52,274
Girija...

1024
01:06:00,508 --> 01:06:03,806
Do you know who the reason
for this is? It is you.

1025
01:06:05,222 --> 01:06:07,417
If you have desires,
then you fulfill it yourself.

1026
01:06:07,601 --> 01:06:09,136
Why do you burden us with it?

1027
01:06:10,885 --> 01:06:13,513
Have I ever asked you to buy Benz car...

1028
01:06:13,593 --> 01:06:15,935
...or a BMW? No, right?

1029
01:06:16,183 --> 01:06:17,405
No, right?

1030
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:20,865
You always told me that
I should become a successful man.

1031
01:06:20,945 --> 01:06:23,549
Have I ever asked you how
successful you are? No, right?

1032
01:06:24,107 --> 01:06:26,691
You always burden
children with your desires...

1033
01:06:26,771 --> 01:06:28,518
...of seeing them become a doctor,
engineer.

1034
01:06:28,821 --> 01:06:31,804
Have we children ever wished
that our parents should be a rich man...

1035
01:06:31,884 --> 01:06:34,431
...or a big officer. No, right?

1036
01:06:34,882 --> 01:06:37,909
We know only two things
that they are our parents.

1037
01:06:39,355 --> 01:06:41,759
Dad, you always tell
me that you have desires.

1038
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:44,841
What desires do you have?
You've done only two things in life...

1039
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:47,949
...you've married my mother and begot me.
That's all!

1040
01:06:54,747 --> 01:06:56,113
That's all?

1041
01:06:57,950 --> 01:06:59,437
Well done, son.

1042
01:07:00,667 --> 01:07:02,099
Well done.

1043
01:07:02,748 --> 01:07:03,966
That's all?

1044
01:07:05,674 --> 01:07:07,522
You know only that much.

1045
01:07:10,257 --> 01:07:11,943
You have to study well...

1046
01:07:12,644 --> 01:07:14,851
...and become a successful man.

1047
01:07:15,662 --> 01:07:19,089
Your father has toiled so hard for it.

1048
01:07:20,732 --> 01:07:22,408
I know that.

1049
01:07:23,576 --> 01:07:25,143
Only I know that.

1050
01:07:30,462 --> 01:07:34,321
Do you mean to say,
you don't want to study?

1051
01:07:35,034 --> 01:07:38,753
You could've told me long back.

1052
01:07:39,412 --> 01:07:43,694
Why did you lie to us
that you were studying?

1053
01:07:47,823 --> 01:07:49,250
We trusted you so much.

1054
01:07:52,385 --> 01:07:56,147
What has your father told you?

1055
01:07:57,834 --> 01:08:01,497
He asked you to study,
that's what parents tell their children...

1056
01:08:01,888 --> 01:08:03,456
...and he also did the same.

1057
01:08:03,536 --> 01:08:06,618
Why don't you study?
- I find education difficult.

1058
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:08,699
I know how difficult education is.

1059
01:08:08,901 --> 01:08:10,766
Do you know that?
I know how difficult it is.

1060
01:08:11,118 --> 01:08:12,996
Earning for the family is no big deal...

1061
01:08:13,374 --> 01:08:15,199
...I know how difficult education is.

1062
01:08:15,279 --> 01:08:17,780
To heck with his dream.

1063
01:08:17,996 --> 01:08:19,320
Let me tell you something.

1064
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:22,144
I will provide him education,
ask him if he has the courage to do it.

1065
01:08:22,224 --> 01:08:23,453
Ask him if he has the courage.

1066
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:25,593
I will provide him education,
ask him if he can do it.

1067
01:08:41,518 --> 01:08:42,671
I will pursue education.

1068
01:08:45,281 --> 01:08:46,353
Yes, Girija.

1069
01:08:49,462 --> 01:08:50,611
I will pursue education.

1070
01:08:55,003 --> 01:08:57,875
It doesn't make any sense.

1071
01:08:58,090 --> 01:09:00,214
He raised his son with compassion...

1072
01:09:00,567 --> 01:09:01,827
...but his son let him down.

1073
01:09:02,013 --> 01:09:05,556
Son broke his father's dream.

1074
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:08,192
He pressurizing his son to study well...

1075
01:09:08,552 --> 01:09:10,122
...he will see sense
when he joins college.

1076
01:09:10,357 --> 01:09:11,893
We will see what happens.

1077
01:09:38,154 --> 01:09:40,790
You said you will become an officer...

1078
01:10:15,574 --> 01:10:17,746
Why did you do like this?

1079
01:10:18,148 --> 01:10:20,472
Why did you do like this?

1080
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:31,037
Oh, my God!

1081
01:10:32,435 --> 01:10:33,410
What's the matter with you?

1082
01:10:33,977 --> 01:10:35,139
Get away.

1083
01:10:39,076 --> 01:10:41,907
Dear! Please stop it!
- For whom did I do all this?

1084
01:10:42,515 --> 01:10:45,379
For whom did I do all this? Leave me!
- Dear!

1085
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:47,157
Dear! Dear!

1086
01:10:49,882 --> 01:10:53,708
Calm down!
- Why did he do like this?

1087
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:59,460
The dream that I had since years...

1088
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:02,754
...he has destroyed it.

1089
01:11:04,533 --> 01:11:08,082
Girija, I am feeling ashamed of myself...

1090
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,835
...for begetting a son like him.

1091
01:11:27,192 --> 01:11:28,597
Control yourself.

1092
01:11:29,726 --> 01:11:31,185
Control yourself.

1093
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:33,655
It's not over yet.

1094
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:38,442
There's nothing you cannot do.

1095
01:11:40,241 --> 01:11:42,534
Girija...
- There's nothing you cannot do.

1096
01:11:43,159 --> 01:11:46,050
My son has brought shame to me.

1097
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:51,661
Don't be dejected.

1098
01:11:52,557 --> 01:11:54,373
You got to move on.

1099
01:11:55,834 --> 01:11:57,876
Look, I know you are very upset...

1100
01:11:58,557 --> 01:12:00,168
...but don't be so dejected.

1101
01:12:00,832 --> 01:12:04,059
Look, trivial issues
do take place in a family.

1102
01:12:04,558 --> 01:12:06,160
Shiva, come on, get up.

1103
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:10,121
Look Shiva,
he is a young boy, he overreacted...

1104
01:12:10,525 --> 01:12:12,855
...that doesn't mean you
join college at this age.

1105
01:12:13,418 --> 01:12:14,466
Why not?

1106
01:12:15,226 --> 01:12:18,913
Why shouldn't he join college?
There is no age bar for learning...

1107
01:12:19,798 --> 01:12:21,276
...dreams are bound to be chased.

1108
01:12:21,356 --> 01:12:25,299
Don't quit, Shiva.
- Syllabus often change...

1109
01:12:25,726 --> 01:12:27,893
...the teacher himself wouldn't
have understood the lesson...

1110
01:12:28,037 --> 01:12:30,583
...then how would he understand?

1111
01:12:30,727 --> 01:12:33,025
If he appears for exam and fails,
people will put him to shame.

1112
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:35,267
Well...

1113
01:12:35,347 --> 01:12:39,129
Look, he's been
grieving since yesterday...

1114
01:12:39,622 --> 01:12:42,611
...don't hurt him more
with your opinions.

1115
01:12:43,845 --> 01:12:45,981
Please understand.
- Okay.

1116
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:47,168
Please leave him alone.

1117
01:12:48,746 --> 01:12:50,771
Okay, bye Shiva.
- Bye, Shiva.

1118
01:12:54,145 --> 01:12:55,219
I will take your leave.

1119
01:13:03,022 --> 01:13:06,066
Look, people have their own opinion...

1120
01:13:06,918 --> 01:13:08,875
...you have to just ignore them.

1121
01:13:11,084 --> 01:13:12,429
Take it.

1122
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:14,557
Get ready.

1123
01:13:26,483 --> 01:13:29,107
You have come on time today.

1124
01:13:29,516 --> 01:13:30,533
I am shocked.

1125
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,992
Shiva.
- Sir.

1126
01:13:35,193 --> 01:13:36,931
What happened?
- Nothing, sir.

1127
01:13:37,011 --> 01:13:39,344
Please go,
I have kept the files in the cupboard...

1128
01:13:39,424 --> 01:13:40,651
...please check them, go.

1129
01:13:42,426 --> 01:13:46,578
Congratulations and celebrations!

1130
01:13:46,658 --> 01:13:49,412
Come, Kumar. Sudhakar, have sweet.

1131
01:13:49,932 --> 01:13:52,015
What for, sir?
- It's a happy occasion.

1132
01:13:53,194 --> 01:13:56,144
My friend Shiva is joining college.

1133
01:13:57,036 --> 01:13:59,692
He was supposed to join
college with me 20 years ago...

1134
01:14:00,157 --> 01:14:02,294
...but his parents
couldn't afford his fees...

1135
01:14:03,506 --> 01:14:06,744
...maybe because of hardships,
but he is now pursuing his education...

1136
01:14:07,059 --> 01:14:09,019
...so let's celebrate.

1137
01:14:09,639 --> 01:14:12,190
Have it. Isn't it funny?

1138
01:14:12,954 --> 01:14:17,576
Sitting with young boys
in the classroom for your age...

1139
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,227
...I can't even imagine.

1140
01:14:20,069 --> 01:14:22,266
It's so funny. I can't...

1141
01:14:22,559 --> 01:14:24,857
Sir, please give me sweet.

1142
01:14:27,921 --> 01:14:31,164
I will do what my son
didn't do for all these days.

1143
01:14:31,734 --> 01:14:35,484
I will prove nothing
is impossible by human beings.

1144
01:14:36,027 --> 01:14:37,117
Why don't you also have sweet?

1145
01:14:39,082 --> 01:14:41,112
It's very good. Please have it people.

1146
01:14:42,092 --> 01:14:42,989
I will take your leave, sir.

1147
01:14:52,484 --> 01:14:54,250
Hey! Girija!
- Yes.

1148
01:14:54,565 --> 01:14:56,533
Sir is here,
serve him piping hot coffee.

1149
01:14:56,613 --> 01:14:58,287
I am coming,
I was making strong coffee.

1150
01:14:58,367 --> 01:14:59,350
Come in, sir.

1151
01:15:00,905 --> 01:15:01,752
Take it.

1152
01:15:07,437 --> 01:15:08,367
Please sit.
- I am fine.

1153
01:15:08,511 --> 01:15:09,812
No, please have a seat.

1154
01:15:14,137 --> 01:15:15,415
This is electricity bill.

1155
01:15:16,579 --> 01:15:17,858
This is cable bill.

1156
01:15:18,439 --> 01:15:19,651
This is grocery bill.

1157
01:15:20,526 --> 01:15:24,701
I have collected the bills,
hereafter you will pay them.

1158
01:15:24,983 --> 01:15:27,596
That's not all,
you will also run the entire family.

1159
01:15:28,446 --> 01:15:31,583
Look, I worked sincerely...

1160
01:15:31,663 --> 01:15:34,101
...looked after the family
and paid for your education...

1161
01:15:34,793 --> 01:15:38,591
...so you will also work sincerely
and pay for my education.

1162
01:15:39,477 --> 01:15:41,043
You will not go on the wrong path.

1163
01:15:41,221 --> 01:15:42,941
You don't trust me, right?

1164
01:15:43,655 --> 01:15:46,644
I swear by my mother...
- It is easy to make promises...

1165
01:15:47,474 --> 01:15:48,488
...but it is difficult to fulfill them.

1166
01:15:48,714 --> 01:15:50,209
Mom, I swear by you...

1167
01:15:50,289 --> 01:15:52,866
...I will work sincerely, run our family
and pay for your education.

1168
01:15:53,263 --> 01:15:54,193
Do you understand?

1169
01:16:26,187 --> 01:16:27,228
Are you a graduate?
- No.

1170
01:16:27,377 --> 01:16:28,237
Any experience?
- No.

1171
01:16:28,357 --> 01:16:30,056
Have you done any course?
- No.

1172
01:16:30,136 --> 01:16:32,325
Do one thing.
- I will do anything.

1173
01:16:32,492 --> 01:16:35,721
Not just here,
you won't get job anywhere. Get out!

1174
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:16,884
Let's take up a deal,
make some money...

1175
01:17:17,154 --> 01:17:18,671
...and pay for your father's education.

1176
01:17:18,751 --> 01:17:20,754
Siddi, I don't want to do anything
as such.

1177
01:17:21,067 --> 01:17:24,656
I have decided to pay for my father's
education with my hard earned money.

1178
01:17:24,736 --> 01:17:27,856
No matter how hard it is, I will work
sincerely and pay for his education.

1179
01:17:28,667 --> 01:17:31,067
You must also bring the student.

1180
01:17:32,553 --> 01:17:34,142
Sir, I am here.

1181
01:17:34,222 --> 01:17:37,883
You want admission for your son or
daughter, isn't it? Then bring them.

1182
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:40,327
Sir... You tell him.

1183
01:17:41,494 --> 01:17:42,694
He is the student.

1184
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:45,728
Stop kidding.
- Stop kidding, ma'am.

1185
01:17:45,808 --> 01:17:47,901
What's funny about it?

1186
01:17:48,917 --> 01:17:51,533
You should be proud of him.

1187
01:17:51,901 --> 01:17:54,532
Sir, please go through the application...

1188
01:17:54,716 --> 01:17:56,391
...he is the student.
- Okay.

1189
01:17:57,202 --> 01:18:00,391
Look, we can't give him admission
for his age in our college...

1190
01:18:00,921 --> 01:18:04,606
...the government has opened
institutions for people like him...

1191
01:18:04,686 --> 01:18:06,746
...take him there,
there's also evening college.

1192
01:18:06,826 --> 01:18:08,681
Sir, we have already been there...

1193
01:18:09,103 --> 01:18:10,714
...please give him admission
in your college.

1194
01:18:11,222 --> 01:18:12,498
Sir, please.

1195
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:16,225
Okay, we will present
your file before the committee...

1196
01:18:16,495 --> 01:18:19,089
...convince the members
and you might get admission.

1197
01:18:19,922 --> 01:18:21,154
I want job, sir.

1198
01:18:21,234 --> 01:18:22,927
Why do you want a job?
- I want money, sir.

1199
01:18:23,133 --> 01:18:26,913
Money is not everything.
- There's a small twist in my life, sir.

1200
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:29,346
This is my father and this is me...

1201
01:18:30,178 --> 01:18:32,719
...he used to work and
I used to study in college...

1202
01:18:33,054 --> 01:18:36,541
...now, a small twist, I am looking
for job and he is joining college.

1203
01:18:36,908 --> 01:18:39,525
What do I do, sir?
- How do you run your family?

1204
01:18:39,605 --> 01:18:40,746
Fix my salary first.

1205
01:18:40,826 --> 01:18:42,779
Rs. 8000 per month.
- Where do you hail from?

1206
01:18:42,963 --> 01:18:44,303
I am from Jademysandra.

1207
01:18:44,498 --> 01:18:47,821
You're from Jademysandra,
why don't you speak Kannada?

1208
01:18:47,901 --> 01:18:49,109
What nonsense are you talking?

1209
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:51,020
You don't understand my problem.

1210
01:18:51,378 --> 01:18:54,644
I haven't had breakfast or coffee
nor could I smoke cigarette...

1211
01:18:54,724 --> 01:18:56,633
...moreover,
there is no petrol in my moped...

1212
01:18:56,713 --> 01:18:59,919
...I am tired pushing it. Have you
ever pushed vehicle for 10 kms?

1213
01:19:00,103 --> 01:19:01,617
Have you ever starved?

1214
01:19:01,697 --> 01:19:03,902
I am not upset because
you didn't offer me job...

1215
01:19:03,982 --> 01:19:07,087
...because you're educated, please
don't underestimate people like me.

1216
01:19:08,093 --> 01:19:09,650
Sir, file for today.

1217
01:19:10,169 --> 01:19:12,979
Where is the new director?
- I will go and check, sir.

1218
01:19:16,607 --> 01:19:18,617
Sir, committee meeting.
- Who are you?

1219
01:19:19,072 --> 01:19:19,775
I am Shiva Kumar.

1220
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:21,504
Please come,
everyone is waiting for you, sir.

1221
01:19:21,584 --> 01:19:23,353
The meeting has started.
- Sir...

1222
01:19:23,548 --> 01:19:24,437
Yes.
- Yes.

1223
01:19:24,517 --> 01:19:25,959
Mr. Shiva Kumar, the new director.

1224
01:19:26,039 --> 01:19:27,397
Mr. Shiva Kumar, please have a seat.

1225
01:19:27,613 --> 01:19:29,472
Sir, greetings.
- Have a seat.

1226
01:19:29,552 --> 01:19:30,683
That's all right, sir.
- Please sit.

1227
01:19:30,763 --> 01:19:32,702
Welcome, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

1228
01:19:33,675 --> 01:19:35,145
Sir, actually I...
- It's okay.

1229
01:19:35,225 --> 01:19:37,286
Student named Kumar who was
debarred last year from our college...

1230
01:19:37,366 --> 01:19:40,421
...his father has applied
for admission in our college...

1231
01:19:40,501 --> 01:19:41,885
...what do you have to say about this?

1232
01:19:41,965 --> 01:19:44,264
Sir, I...
- Like father like son.

1233
01:19:44,344 --> 01:19:45,669
The father will be just like son.

1234
01:19:45,885 --> 01:19:47,442
I don't think this is right.

1235
01:19:47,522 --> 01:19:50,772
Usually, there's 96 percent
result every year in our college...

1236
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:52,621
...we are aiming to reach...

1237
01:19:52,701 --> 01:19:53,756
...100 percent this year.
- Yes, sir.

1238
01:19:53,994 --> 01:19:57,172
If we gave him admission,
he has to pass in all the subjects...

1239
01:19:57,252 --> 01:19:58,805
...otherwise,
the reputation will get tarnished.

1240
01:19:58,885 --> 01:20:02,329
The entire is aware
of his uncultured activities...

1241
01:20:02,545 --> 01:20:04,734
...we could've supported him.
- Sir...

1242
01:20:05,045 --> 01:20:07,184
You have given your opinion...

1243
01:20:07,264 --> 01:20:09,117
...what do you have to say about this,
Mr. Shiva Kumar?

1244
01:20:12,765 --> 01:20:15,563
I am not Director Shiva Kumar...

1245
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:17,846
...Kumar, the student who got debarred...

1246
01:20:18,676 --> 01:20:20,986
...I am his father Shiva Kumar.

1247
01:20:21,338 --> 01:20:22,784
Oh, my God!
- Really?

1248
01:20:23,135 --> 01:20:27,689
My son might have made mistake
but please don't punish me.

1249
01:20:28,284 --> 01:20:30,608
Please give me admission, sir.

1250
01:20:30,688 --> 01:20:33,446
Sir, due respect to everyone's view.

1251
01:20:34,338 --> 01:20:36,892
Education is the
birth right of every man...

1252
01:20:37,689 --> 01:20:41,905
...there is no law for
age bar to pursue education.

1253
01:20:42,491 --> 01:20:45,631
I read an article in
the newspaper last week...

1254
01:20:45,711 --> 01:20:50,198
...94 years old man in Nepal
it seems he is still going to school.

1255
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:52,239
He's a great example, isn't he?

1256
01:20:52,496 --> 01:20:57,266
To become a developed country,
we must consider this.

1257
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:59,661
It's a wonderful
opportunity to our college...

1258
01:20:59,741 --> 01:21:02,175
...I think we should give
admission to Mr. Shiva Kumar.

1259
01:21:02,472 --> 01:21:06,539
Ma'am, what are you saying?
- Ma'am, how can we do that?

1260
01:21:06,619 --> 01:21:08,634
Sir, I...
- Wait a minute.

1261
01:21:08,972 --> 01:21:10,742
I see honesty in him.

1262
01:21:11,326 --> 01:21:14,474
If we gave him admission in our college,
our college will gain good reputation.

1263
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:15,582
Exactly.

1264
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:18,082
I am giving him admission,
no more arguments. Okay?

1265
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:21,245
Sir, thank you. Thank you.

1266
01:21:21,325 --> 01:21:26,182
Sir, he tried really hard to find job,
but failed.

1267
01:21:26,262 --> 01:21:28,547
His father is your childhood friend...

1268
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:30,222
...please offer him a job.

1269
01:21:31,222 --> 01:21:32,425
Greetings, sir.

1270
01:21:36,817 --> 01:21:39,195
This chair has been reserved for you...

1271
01:21:40,384 --> 01:21:41,803
...take a seat.

1272
01:21:42,573 --> 01:21:44,235
What he is...

1273
01:21:46,952 --> 01:21:48,925
Had your father realized things...

1274
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:51,844
...he would've made you also see sense.

1275
01:21:52,114 --> 01:21:54,020
He is overconfident.

1276
01:21:54,871 --> 01:21:58,303
You're educated,
what kind of a job should I offer you?

1277
01:21:59,527 --> 01:22:01,636
There's vacancy for peon's post,
will you do it?

1278
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:03,366
I will do it, sir.
- Sudhakar.

1279
01:22:03,446 --> 01:22:05,982
Sir.
- Let him join from today.

1280
01:22:06,349 --> 01:22:11,062
Go and bring a cup of tea.

1281
01:22:11,365 --> 01:22:13,775
Please guide me.
- Come. Have faith in God.

1282
01:22:28,651 --> 01:22:31,325
What's this?
- My resignation letter.

1283
01:22:46,088 --> 01:22:47,309
Kumar?

1284
01:22:50,629 --> 01:22:54,164
'I will bring him to this position.'

1285
01:23:16,433 --> 01:23:17,121
Have breakfast and go.

1286
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:18,455
I am getting late,
I will have it in college.

1287
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:19,742
Okay, take care.

1288
01:23:43,202 --> 01:23:45,762
The tea tastes awful.
How dare you?

1289
01:23:46,142 --> 01:23:48,598
Don't mess with me. Manager.
- Sir.

1290
01:23:48,953 --> 01:23:49,925
You know about me, don't you?

1291
01:23:50,005 --> 01:23:51,144
Yes, I do.
- Then tell him.

1292
01:23:51,224 --> 01:23:53,926
He's new...
- Sir, please serve me curry.

1293
01:23:54,817 --> 01:23:57,481
If you don't mend your ways,
I will get your license cancelled...

1294
01:23:57,561 --> 01:23:59,013
...and chase you away from the college.

1295
01:23:59,194 --> 01:24:01,243
Please, sir...
- Sir, also serve chutney.

1296
01:24:01,485 --> 01:24:03,734
Serve him chutney.

1297
01:24:04,028 --> 01:24:05,559
He has been...

1298
01:24:05,639 --> 01:24:07,436
Who are you? Get up.

1299
01:24:08,968 --> 01:24:11,649
Kumar, who got debarred,
he is his father.

1300
01:24:12,609 --> 01:24:14,840
College Kumar failed in exams.

1301
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:19,622
We have tolerated your son enough...

1302
01:24:19,702 --> 01:24:21,837
...should we now tolerate you?
- Sir...

1303
01:24:22,286 --> 01:24:25,746
What have I done?
Please leave me alone.

1304
01:24:25,928 --> 01:24:27,731
What have I...
- Leave you alone?

1305
01:24:27,811 --> 01:24:30,195
What will you do if I don't.
- Sir...

1306
01:24:30,275 --> 01:24:31,400
What will you do?

1307
01:24:33,566 --> 01:24:35,787
Take your hand off.
- Please don't...

1308
01:24:35,953 --> 01:24:37,600
Don't worry, father-in-law.
- Father-in-law?

1309
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,737
He is of your father's age...

1310
01:24:39,924 --> 01:24:42,885
...you are picking up fight with him?
Is this your heroism?

1311
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:47,984
Do you know who is he?
He used to be a gangster.

1312
01:24:48,447 --> 01:24:49,524
What?

1313
01:24:50,052 --> 01:24:52,391
He has now reformed. Let it be.

1314
01:24:52,702 --> 01:24:56,406
It's first day of college,
don't create a scene get going.

1315
01:24:56,486 --> 01:24:58,347
How dare you?
- Come, father-in-law.

1316
01:25:01,314 --> 01:25:02,781
Who are you?
- Sorry, sir.

1317
01:25:03,632 --> 01:25:06,282
I pretended just to save you...

1318
01:25:06,552 --> 01:25:08,094
...please don't feel offended.

1319
01:25:08,343 --> 01:25:09,990
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1320
01:25:10,567 --> 01:25:13,057
Sir, I need your help.

1321
01:25:13,368 --> 01:25:15,139
My help? What help?
- Yes.

1322
01:25:15,339 --> 01:25:16,446
Come here.

1323
01:25:17,756 --> 01:25:20,015
She is...
- She's having problem in the college...

1324
01:25:20,685 --> 01:25:21,891
...her father didn't show up...

1325
01:25:22,832 --> 01:25:24,902
...will you please pose as her father?
- Please.

1326
01:25:24,982 --> 01:25:26,535
Please.
- Oh, my God! Me?

1327
01:25:27,117 --> 01:25:28,069
I can't do that.

1328
01:25:28,921 --> 01:25:31,075
I am the student of this college.

1329
01:25:32,277 --> 01:25:34,020
Yes, today is my first day.

1330
01:25:35,472 --> 01:25:38,602
Kumar, the one who was
debarred from the college...

1331
01:25:40,674 --> 01:25:41,662
...I am his father.

1332
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:43,570
Please don't mistake me.

1333
01:25:43,792 --> 01:25:45,669
Thanks for helping me. Bye.

1334
01:25:46,347 --> 01:25:47,414
Thank you very much.

1335
01:25:50,154 --> 01:25:51,129
What happened?

1336
01:25:52,559 --> 01:25:54,693
He is really my father-in-law to be.

1337
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:56,460
Hi, everybody!
- Hi, sir!

1338
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:57,647
My name is Ramesh.

1339
01:25:59,007 --> 01:26:01,245
Introduce yourselves.
Come on, you start.

1340
01:26:01,879 --> 01:26:02,970
My name is D'Souza.

1341
01:26:04,196 --> 01:26:06,363
My name is Tejas.
- My name is Vijay.

1342
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,691
My name is Kirti.
- You?

1343
01:26:11,029 --> 01:26:12,669
Sir, greetings.
- Introduce yourself.

1344
01:26:12,749 --> 01:26:15,305
Sir, my name is Shiva Kumar.

1345
01:26:15,554 --> 01:26:18,669
It's not over, wait.

1346
01:26:19,330 --> 01:26:21,721
All of us came to know
that your name is Shiva Kumar.

1347
01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:26,110
How old are you?
- Sir, 54.

1348
01:26:26,618 --> 01:26:27,742
54!

1349
01:26:31,777 --> 01:26:35,540
At this age,
you must read newspaper at home...

1350
01:26:35,739 --> 01:26:37,311
...not come to college to study.

1351
01:26:38,784 --> 01:26:43,625
Okay. Why were you adamant
to join our college?

1352
01:26:44,277 --> 01:26:46,458
Come on, speak.
- Sir...

1353
01:26:47,792 --> 01:26:49,109
My son...

1354
01:26:50,045 --> 01:26:51,440
Ku...
- Kumar.

1355
01:26:51,666 --> 01:26:52,114
Yes, sir.

1356
01:26:52,194 --> 01:26:55,232
The student who was debarred
from our college.

1357
01:26:55,542 --> 01:26:57,473
I think all of you know Kumar.

1358
01:26:57,683 --> 01:26:59,078
Yes, sir.
- See.

1359
01:26:59,233 --> 01:27:00,672
See how famous he is.

1360
01:27:00,871 --> 01:27:02,841
He brought shame to the college...

1361
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:05,055
...do you want to bring more shame?

1362
01:27:06,572 --> 01:27:14,248
Sir, it is our culture
to recognise guru as God.

1363
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:20,188
You will have God's blessings.

1364
01:27:22,192 --> 01:27:23,796
Mom, where is my bike?

1365
01:27:24,456 --> 01:27:26,543
Who is going to college?
- Father.

1366
01:27:26,814 --> 01:27:29,627
We purchased bike to
avoid going late to college.

1367
01:27:29,782 --> 01:27:30,685
You are trying to say that...

1368
01:27:30,765 --> 01:27:34,283
...father has taken the bike
and I should take the moped, right?

1369
01:27:34,363 --> 01:27:35,490
You got it.

1370
01:27:36,326 --> 01:27:37,771
Father's moped belongs to you...

1371
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:39,270
...since you have taken
the responsibilities of your father.

1372
01:27:40,106 --> 01:27:40,956
Take it.

1373
01:29:00,563 --> 01:29:04,950
...identifying, measuring and communicating
the economic information of...

1374
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:06,896
...an organisation...

1375
01:29:06,976 --> 01:29:09,186
I need to take pill before food.

1376
01:29:09,266 --> 01:29:10,770
...for decision making.

1377
01:29:10,936 --> 01:29:16,172
An accounting standard is a principle
and accounting serves the purpose.

1378
01:29:18,034 --> 01:29:20,856
Objective of account...
- Hey!

1379
01:29:20,936 --> 01:29:21,714
What are you doing?

1380
01:29:21,794 --> 01:29:23,026
...depending upon their...

1381
01:29:23,106 --> 01:29:24,648
I must have food on time.

1382
01:29:24,728 --> 01:29:26,524
However...
- The lecturer will catch you.

1383
01:29:26,604 --> 01:29:29,198
...general of the...
- Close it.

1384
01:29:31,965 --> 01:29:33,903
I smell food.

1385
01:29:34,489 --> 01:29:36,437
Sir, Kumar is eating.

1386
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:41,120
Shiva Kumar,
is this classroom or canteen?

1387
01:29:41,281 --> 01:29:43,573
You might also cook
food in the classroom.

1388
01:29:43,653 --> 01:29:45,925
Sir, I am a diabetic...

1389
01:29:46,168 --> 01:29:49,030
...I must have pill exactly
at 1 o'clock and have my meal.

1390
01:29:49,533 --> 01:29:52,428
I couldn't wait, I am hungry, so...

1391
01:29:52,589 --> 01:29:53,973
You can't eat in my class.

1392
01:29:54,516 --> 01:29:55,806
Go out.
- Okay, sir.

1393
01:29:56,669 --> 01:29:58,158
What's the food?

1394
01:29:58,423 --> 01:29:59,702
It's Pilaf, sir.
- Pilaf.

1395
01:30:00,222 --> 01:30:02,735
Bring some for me tomorrow.
- Okay, sir.

1396
01:30:04,029 --> 01:30:06,227
Stop laughing, pay attention.

1397
01:30:27,006 --> 01:30:31,759
Split Black Gram, refined flour, wheat
flour, pigeon pea, hyacinth bean.

1398
01:30:32,666 --> 01:30:34,609
Mom, do we eat so much?

1399
01:30:35,356 --> 01:30:37,217
Food does taste good while eating...

1400
01:30:37,445 --> 01:30:39,860
...you will know the value only
when you have to buy groceries.

1401
01:30:43,948 --> 01:30:46,646
First one is financial information...

1402
01:30:47,587 --> 01:30:51,185
...second one is statutory and others...

1403
01:30:51,475 --> 01:30:52,838
...the main thing is...

1404
01:30:56,728 --> 01:30:57,897
Shiva Kumar!

1405
01:31:01,711 --> 01:31:04,756
Should I get you mattress and pillow?

1406
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:08,166
Sorry, sir. I fall asleep
after taking pills at noon...

1407
01:31:08,602 --> 01:31:10,594
...but I am still trying to control.

1408
01:31:10,926 --> 01:31:13,887
If you sleep again,
I will throw you out of the class.

1409
01:31:57,526 --> 01:31:59,067
Kumar!

1410
01:31:59,187 --> 01:32:04,537
I told you Kumar will
be successful one day.

1411
01:32:04,851 --> 01:32:07,640
Sir, excuse me. In which
classroom can I find my husband?

1412
01:32:08,028 --> 01:32:10,643
He forgot his lunch
and also the pills.

1413
01:32:11,218 --> 01:32:14,228
Where would he be
other than the classroom.

1414
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:15,309
The room there.

1415
01:32:15,389 --> 01:32:16,365
That one there?
- Yes.

1416
01:32:16,445 --> 01:32:17,499
Okay, sir.
- Okay.

1417
01:32:17,702 --> 01:32:20,409
Dear...
- Your handwriting is really bad.

1418
01:32:20,489 --> 01:32:24,040
How dare you sleep during my lecture?
Write it.

1419
01:32:25,197 --> 01:32:26,869
Master!

1420
01:32:28,585 --> 01:32:32,521
Girija?
- You've been scolding him constantly.

1421
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:34,327
If your lecture is boring...

1422
01:32:34,407 --> 01:32:35,802
...why do you hold students responsible?
- Girija.

1423
01:32:35,882 --> 01:32:38,686
Be quiet. Do you know how old is he?

1424
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:41,520
How old are you?
- 52.

1425
01:32:42,427 --> 01:32:43,706
Do you suffer from blood pressure?
- Yes.

1426
01:32:43,838 --> 01:32:45,062
Sugar level.
- 270.

1427
01:32:45,704 --> 01:32:47,890
Oh, my God. What's the time?

1428
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:50,287
It's 1:30 p.m.
- Don't you have common sense?

1429
01:32:50,425 --> 01:32:51,378
Please sit.

1430
01:32:51,838 --> 01:32:53,880
I said sit.
- Please sit.

1431
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:54,954
My God.
- She's very dangerous, sir.

1432
01:32:55,034 --> 01:32:56,578
If you're suffering from
blood pressure and diabetes...

1433
01:32:56,658 --> 01:32:58,655
...you need to have your meal on time.
Close your book.

1434
01:32:59,125 --> 01:33:01,547
Take it. Isn't your
family concerned about you?

1435
01:33:02,384 --> 01:33:03,333
Take it.

1436
01:33:03,413 --> 01:33:08,245
Master, if you don't have
meals on time, you will feel fatigue.

1437
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:10,446
Take it.

1438
01:33:14,937 --> 01:33:17,276
Sir, why are you crying?

1439
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:19,476
Isn't the food tasty?
- That's not so.

1440
01:33:21,282 --> 01:33:25,295
I got emotional seeing
your love for each other.

1441
01:33:27,058 --> 01:33:30,586
My wife doesn't care about me.

1442
01:33:31,278 --> 01:33:34,633
Kumar, you're very lucky.
- Thank you, sir.

1443
01:33:35,173 --> 01:33:37,256
The food tastes great.
- Thank you.

1444
01:33:38,653 --> 01:33:41,345
I have mixed it, have a peg first...

1445
01:33:41,677 --> 01:33:42,843
...let's have the discussion later.

1446
01:33:42,923 --> 01:33:44,046
No, thanks.
- Drink.

1447
01:33:46,099 --> 01:33:48,420
Tell me about your problem.

1448
01:33:49,239 --> 01:33:50,837
Hey!

1449
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:53,073
Oh, my God!
What's the matter with him?

1450
01:33:53,648 --> 01:33:55,164
What was the hurry?

1451
01:33:55,244 --> 01:33:58,125
I have been trying really hard
but unable to find a job.

1452
01:33:59,016 --> 01:34:00,649
I haven't completed my degree too.

1453
01:34:04,779 --> 01:34:06,688
I also have no money to do business.

1454
01:34:06,927 --> 01:34:09,407
All right. A man has to do a job...

1455
01:34:09,487 --> 01:34:10,713
...continue with the same work.

1456
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:12,497
How will I manage
with petty salary, Nani?

1457
01:34:12,577 --> 01:34:16,471
College fees, house rent, water bill,
cable bill, grocery, medical...

1458
01:34:16,551 --> 01:34:18,523
...petrol, EMI, what do I do?

1459
01:34:18,882 --> 01:34:20,892
I can't take it anymore.

1460
01:34:22,376 --> 01:34:23,244
I can't.

1461
01:34:23,961 --> 01:34:25,807
I am unable to find
solution to the problem.

1462
01:34:26,844 --> 01:34:31,263
I will accept defeat before my father.
- Don't do just one job.

1463
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:32,987
Find another job.

1464
01:34:33,496 --> 01:34:36,418
You're talented, you can do anything.

1465
01:34:37,521 --> 01:34:38,809
Do this.

1466
01:34:38,889 --> 01:34:41,815
Your father owns 2 acres
of land in your hometown...

1467
01:34:42,091 --> 01:34:43,967
...you can't sell it
so do something with it.

1468
01:34:44,047 --> 01:34:45,018
What do I do with it?

1469
01:34:45,098 --> 01:34:47,585
A man can cheat you...

1470
01:34:47,730 --> 01:34:49,475
...but land will never let you down.

1471
01:34:49,555 --> 01:34:52,679
Listen to me. Do something there.

1472
01:34:53,135 --> 01:34:54,222
Here, drink it.

1473
01:34:54,302 --> 01:34:56,062
You're intelligent,
you will surely do something.

1474
01:35:11,491 --> 01:35:13,767
Sir, where is survey no. 64?

1475
01:35:13,847 --> 01:35:18,783
You will find oldies at the village square
gossiping smoking local cigarette...

1476
01:35:18,863 --> 01:35:20,568
...behind them is survey no. 64.

1477
01:35:20,648 --> 01:35:21,765
Ask them, they will let you know.

1478
01:35:23,902 --> 01:35:26,233
Are you degree Shiva Kumar's son?

1479
01:35:26,392 --> 01:35:28,530
Do you know him?
- Yes, we do.

1480
01:35:28,925 --> 01:35:31,076
He would tell everyone in the village...

1481
01:35:31,498 --> 01:35:33,697
...that he will become a graduate.

1482
01:35:33,843 --> 01:35:35,489
He's doing it now.
- What?

1483
01:35:35,569 --> 01:35:36,764
Graduation.

1484
01:35:36,844 --> 01:35:38,914
He has grown old,
he won't get sleep at night.

1485
01:35:39,267 --> 01:35:40,180
So, let him study.

1486
01:35:40,656 --> 01:35:43,706
What brings you here?
- I want to start a business on this land.

1487
01:35:43,786 --> 01:35:45,024
Listen, son...

1488
01:35:45,721 --> 01:35:48,488
...everyone goes from the
village to the city to earn.

1489
01:35:48,568 --> 01:35:50,697
You've come from city and
you say you want to earn here...

1490
01:35:50,777 --> 01:35:52,059
...what will you do?

1491
01:35:52,225 --> 01:35:54,206
Sir, my story is very complicated.

1492
01:35:54,286 --> 01:35:55,801
You won't get any workers.

1493
01:35:56,006 --> 01:35:57,234
I will work.

1494
01:35:57,314 --> 01:35:58,690
Where will you get water from?

1495
01:35:58,770 --> 01:36:01,026
Where do you get it from?
- I own a bore well.

1496
01:36:01,197 --> 01:36:02,266
Do you get water?

1497
01:36:02,346 --> 01:36:04,823
They've provided pipeline.

1498
01:36:04,903 --> 01:36:06,645
Give me some.
- What? Pipe?

1499
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,853
Water.
- Water?

1500
01:36:09,362 --> 01:36:11,078
I am famous for supplying water.

1501
01:36:11,511 --> 01:36:12,663
I shall give it to you too.

1502
01:36:13,008 --> 01:36:15,071
What will you do?

1503
01:36:15,258 --> 01:36:17,007
Sir, I had a look in the vicinity...

1504
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:18,672
...nobody has grown tomatoes.

1505
01:36:18,752 --> 01:36:21,072
Oh, you're very smart.

1506
01:36:21,244 --> 01:36:22,796
You're not like Degree.

1507
01:36:22,876 --> 01:36:25,110
Sir, please you both help me.

1508
01:36:25,190 --> 01:36:29,194
You go, when you return, we'll see.

1509
01:36:29,274 --> 01:36:31,348
Okay, sir. I shall leave.
- Okay, bye.

1510
01:36:31,428 --> 01:36:32,593
To hell with him.

1511
01:36:32,673 --> 01:36:34,723
Buddy, look at him.

1512
01:36:35,914 --> 01:36:38,504
She's going around with an old man.

1513
01:36:40,132 --> 01:36:41,902
One moment, I will be back.
- She's acting too smart.

1514
01:36:41,982 --> 01:36:43,043
Don't.

1515
01:36:43,817 --> 01:36:44,686
Come, let's go.

1516
01:36:45,656 --> 01:36:47,920
You don't understand,
if I don't answer them today...

1517
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,818
...they will pass comments at me.
- Forget it.

1518
01:36:50,405 --> 01:36:52,204
Even I am an old man.

1519
01:36:52,453 --> 01:36:55,248
Today is last, no one in the
college should call you as old man.

1520
01:36:55,436 --> 01:36:57,319
I make sure of that.
- What will you do?

1521
01:36:57,645 --> 01:36:59,068
You believe me, don't you?

1522
01:36:59,148 --> 01:37:00,125
Yes.
- Then let's go.

1523
01:37:01,885 --> 01:37:02,443
Who is it?

1524
01:37:19,275 --> 01:37:20,341
What is this?

1525
01:37:32,536 --> 01:37:34,579
What say about my style?

1526
01:37:34,729 --> 01:37:36,567
What avatar is this?

1527
01:37:38,155 --> 01:37:39,290
Where's your moustache?

1528
01:37:41,348 --> 01:37:42,644
What is this?

1529
01:37:43,452 --> 01:37:46,889
Girija, boys in the college tease me.

1530
01:37:47,442 --> 01:37:50,471
What is this?
- So, Kirti took me to the beauty parlor...

1531
01:37:50,551 --> 01:37:51,894
...and made me like this.

1532
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:54,036
You always say...

1533
01:37:54,116 --> 01:37:56,150
...that I should look smart
like a hero and go to the college.

1534
01:37:56,682 --> 01:37:58,625
Am I not looking good?

1535
01:37:58,979 --> 01:37:59,953
You look nice.

1536
01:38:00,452 --> 01:38:02,639
You look like a king to me.

1537
01:38:02,839 --> 01:38:04,704
You look 20 years younger.

1538
01:38:04,936 --> 01:38:06,823
I will ward off your evil eyes.

1539
01:38:08,357 --> 01:38:09,414
Where's Kumar?

1540
01:38:09,613 --> 01:38:12,065
What brings you here?
- How's everyone at home?

1541
01:38:12,464 --> 01:38:14,966
Your office boy told
me that your wife is pregnant.

1542
01:38:15,232 --> 01:38:18,753
Hey, forget about that.
Tell me what brings you here?

1543
01:38:19,511 --> 01:38:21,294
He's my friend Kumar.

1544
01:38:21,374 --> 01:38:23,807
Sir, greetings.
- He needs money urgently.

1545
01:38:23,887 --> 01:38:25,119
What documents does he have?

1546
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:27,389
Sir, I have ration card,
driving license, voter's ID...

1547
01:38:27,469 --> 01:38:30,616
...cheque book and...
- That's of no use to me.

1548
01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:34,762
Didn't I tell you sir will help you?

1549
01:38:35,266 --> 01:38:39,645
I've been listening stories
of everyone and giving them loan.

1550
01:38:40,115 --> 01:38:42,817
I've got ruined doing so.

1551
01:38:43,149 --> 01:38:44,333
I hope you're aware of
the consequences...

1552
01:38:44,413 --> 01:38:45,523
...if you don't pay the interest on time.
- Yes.

1553
01:38:45,603 --> 01:38:47,632
Okay.
- Give them money.

1554
01:39:01,659 --> 01:39:03,176
He's come from the city.

1555
01:39:03,256 --> 01:39:06,082
He doesn't know what to do,
so he's acting crazy.

1556
01:39:06,514 --> 01:39:08,013
Hey, come here!

1557
01:39:08,323 --> 01:39:09,758
I don't know anything.
Will you tell me?

1558
01:39:09,957 --> 01:39:12,160
You come here.
- Will you tell me if I come there?

1559
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:13,294
Hey, come here.
- Come!

1560
01:39:15,766 --> 01:39:17,005
Come soon.

1561
01:39:17,829 --> 01:39:20,259
Did your pant get torn?
- Yes.

1562
01:39:20,564 --> 01:39:22,678
What were you doing there?
- I was digging.

1563
01:39:23,509 --> 01:39:25,435
Who told you?
- I watched it on YouTube.

1564
01:39:25,645 --> 01:39:29,659
Hey, you won't find information
about these things on YouTube.

1565
01:39:29,739 --> 01:39:32,647
You have to learn
it from the experience.

1566
01:39:32,885 --> 01:39:35,304
Your pant is torn.
Give him your loin cloth.

1567
01:39:36,604 --> 01:39:37,888
Take this, tie it.

1568
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:39,595
Go.
- Sir, what will you wear?

1569
01:39:39,675 --> 01:39:41,792
I know how to save my dignity.

1570
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,382
You leave.
- Go.

1571
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:46,051
Hey, do you know how
to wear a loin cloth?

1572
01:39:46,131 --> 01:39:47,935
Will you watch YouTube
to learn how to wear it?

1573
01:39:48,015 --> 01:39:49,527
Sir, please don't joke.

1574
01:40:36,116 --> 01:40:36,973
Go!

1575
01:41:32,896 --> 01:41:34,291
Dad, tell me.
- Hello, Kumar.

1576
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:37,186
I have to write the exam,
but I am standing out.

1577
01:41:37,350 --> 01:41:37,874
Why?

1578
01:41:37,954 --> 01:41:39,701
You have to pay the
fees for me to appear for exams.

1579
01:41:39,781 --> 01:41:41,341
Why are you telling this to me
at the last moment?

1580
01:41:41,421 --> 01:41:42,363
You should've told me earlier.

1581
01:41:42,443 --> 01:41:43,865
Hello, dude.

1582
01:41:44,259 --> 01:41:46,270
I have lot of tension.

1583
01:41:46,656 --> 01:41:48,234
Don't you know about studies?

1584
01:41:48,892 --> 01:41:51,549
Didn't I pay the fees
on time when you were studying?

1585
01:41:51,629 --> 01:41:53,874
That's your responsibility now.
Take care of it.

1586
01:41:54,328 --> 01:41:56,905
If you pay the fees
I will appear for exams.

1587
01:41:57,555 --> 01:42:01,555
If not, I will go
for the morning show.

1588
01:42:01,802 --> 01:42:02,973
I will come, wait.

1589
01:42:03,692 --> 01:42:04,935
You idiot!

1590
01:42:06,708 --> 01:42:09,010
Stop.
- I want to meet the principal.

1591
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:10,154
I can't let a tomato vendor inside.

1592
01:42:10,234 --> 01:42:12,221
I am an old student Kumar,
didn't you recognize me?

1593
01:42:12,301 --> 01:42:14,264
Principal has called me, can I go?
- Okay, go.

1594
01:42:15,994 --> 01:42:17,541
I am very proud of you, I say.

1595
01:42:17,887 --> 01:42:19,692
I thought you'll
never come up in life.

1596
01:42:19,772 --> 01:42:22,327
At least you have grown tomatoes.
Very good.

1597
01:42:22,682 --> 01:42:24,059
Sir, I grew them.

1598
01:42:24,425 --> 01:42:26,301
I brought some for you.

1599
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:27,983
Sir, tomatoes sell
at a very good rate.

1600
01:42:28,063 --> 01:42:29,214
I know.

1601
01:42:29,449 --> 01:42:31,193
So, I don't buy tomatoes.

1602
01:42:31,379 --> 01:42:32,756
But I am sure you'll earn good money.

1603
01:42:33,026 --> 01:42:35,399
Sir, my father...
- He's an old man.

1604
01:42:35,718 --> 01:42:37,372
He acts like children.

1605
01:42:37,452 --> 01:42:38,949
It's very pathetic, I say.

1606
01:42:39,343 --> 01:42:41,204
But I have to say one
thing about your father...

1607
01:42:41,663 --> 01:42:42,810
...he's very energetic.

1608
01:42:42,890 --> 01:42:45,295
Sir, my father said
he can't appear for the exams.

1609
01:42:45,375 --> 01:42:47,044
Why?

1610
01:42:47,936 --> 01:42:49,026
Puttaraju?

1611
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:51,930
Sir?
- Puttaraju...

1612
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:53,828
why didn't you let Shiva Kumar
appear for exams?

1613
01:42:53,908 --> 01:42:55,280
Sir, he hasn't paid the fees yet.

1614
01:42:55,451 --> 01:42:56,597
Okay, leave.

1615
01:42:58,474 --> 01:43:00,881
Now I know why you
brought tomatoes for me.

1616
01:43:01,254 --> 01:43:02,356
I don't want it, take it with you.

1617
01:43:02,648 --> 01:43:04,672
Sir, I beg of you.

1618
01:43:04,809 --> 01:43:06,297
Please let my father appear for exams.

1619
01:43:06,545 --> 01:43:08,547
I don't wish to shatter his dreams.

1620
01:43:09,986 --> 01:43:13,608
Sir, I'll sell these tomatoes and
I'll get the money within two days.

1621
01:43:13,931 --> 01:43:15,605
Sir, if you don't believe me...

1622
01:43:15,685 --> 01:43:17,491
...I will deliver 5 sacks of
tomatoes to your house.

1623
01:43:17,571 --> 01:43:21,608
Oh, do you mean to say,
I should resign the job...

1624
01:43:21,848 --> 01:43:23,618
...and sell tomatoes in the market?
- Sir...

1625
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:25,219
Take it with you.
- Sir.

1626
01:43:25,712 --> 01:43:26,727
I don't know what to do.

1627
01:43:26,807 --> 01:43:27,776
Sir, I beg of you.
- Hey!

1628
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,359
Leave my legs.

1629
01:43:32,580 --> 01:43:33,814
Kumar, what is this?

1630
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:36,764
You've changed a lot.

1631
01:43:38,786 --> 01:43:40,695
It's about time. Okay.

1632
01:43:41,288 --> 01:43:43,484
Sell these and pay the fees, okay?

1633
01:43:43,564 --> 01:43:44,658
Okay, sir.

1634
01:43:45,034 --> 01:43:46,186
Puttaraju.
- Sir?

1635
01:43:46,828 --> 01:43:48,232
Let Shiva Kumar appear for exams.

1636
01:43:48,356 --> 01:43:49,149
Okay, sir.

1637
01:43:49,229 --> 01:43:50,710
Sir, thanks a lot.
- Let it be.

1638
01:43:51,826 --> 01:43:53,346
Come on, let's take a selfie.

1639
01:43:55,362 --> 01:43:56,630
Hi.
- Hi.

1640
01:43:58,092 --> 01:43:59,685
Hey, go away.
- He?

1641
01:43:59,984 --> 01:44:02,147
Hey, get going.
- Bye.

1642
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:04,152
Bye, Sushma.
- Bye.

1643
01:44:04,232 --> 01:44:06,420
We'll meet tomorrow.
- Enough.

1644
01:44:07,124 --> 01:44:09,017
I've spoken to the principal.
You appear for exams.

1645
01:44:09,549 --> 01:44:10,689
Kumar...

1646
01:44:11,879 --> 01:44:14,608
I saw from the window,
you were crying before the principal...

1647
01:44:14,906 --> 01:44:17,469
...by holding his feet...

1648
01:44:17,657 --> 01:44:19,279
...and doing drama before him.

1649
01:44:19,678 --> 01:44:20,923
Don't feel too much.

1650
01:44:21,565 --> 01:44:23,695
Go and do your work. Bye.

1651
01:44:24,131 --> 01:44:26,224
I am getting late to write exams.
- Okay.

1652
01:44:27,027 --> 01:44:28,576
Do well in exams, okay?

1653
01:44:28,656 --> 01:44:31,281
You pay the fees on time, okay?
- Okay.

1654
01:44:31,361 --> 01:44:32,685
I will pay.
- Bye.

1655
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,502
Go, I came to this state
because of doing all this.

1656
01:44:35,582 --> 01:44:36,988
I am waiting for your results.

1657
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:41,452
Sir, you're getting everything loaded.
- Yes.

1658
01:44:41,532 --> 01:44:43,848
We work hard for the entire month...

1659
01:44:44,175 --> 01:44:46,943
...they come for one day
and earn lot of money.

1660
01:44:47,023 --> 01:44:47,956
I didn't understand.

1661
01:44:48,036 --> 01:44:50,505
I myself couldn't
understand it till now...

1662
01:44:50,585 --> 01:44:53,081
...you've come recently,
how will you know?

1663
01:44:53,365 --> 01:44:56,347
Kumar, the grains that we grow...

1664
01:44:56,427 --> 01:44:59,281
...we can't take them to
market and sell it.

1665
01:44:59,361 --> 01:45:02,146
They come here,
pay us some money, and take it.

1666
01:45:02,226 --> 01:45:04,234
We're not getting paid
enough for the grains we grow.

1667
01:45:04,354 --> 01:45:07,817
Many farmers have left the village
and some have committed suicide.

1668
01:45:08,211 --> 01:45:09,729
Can't you sell it to a company?

1669
01:45:10,102 --> 01:45:11,258
Company?

1670
01:45:11,612 --> 01:45:13,808
We don't have so
much knowledge about it.

1671
01:45:14,613 --> 01:45:16,381
Who will take the responsibility?

1672
01:45:16,775 --> 01:45:19,042
Our villagers are
not capable of doing so.

1673
01:45:20,650 --> 01:45:23,905
Give me a moment, I will take the number
from Just Dial and talk to them.

1674
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:25,859
Hello?
- 'Welcome to Just Dial.'

1675
01:45:25,939 --> 01:45:28,146
Can I get any vegetable
distributor's phone number, sir?

1676
01:45:28,279 --> 01:45:29,900
'Sure, we'll send a message.'
- Okay.

1677
01:45:30,529 --> 01:45:31,981
I'll get the number in five minutes.

1678
01:45:32,235 --> 01:45:33,092
I will talk to them.

1679
01:45:33,172 --> 01:45:35,382
He is talking to everyone
sitting in one place.

1680
01:45:35,766 --> 01:45:37,980
Kumar, the number that you called now...

1681
01:45:38,361 --> 01:45:39,966
...if we call them and
ask them about anything...

1682
01:45:40,201 --> 01:45:42,741
...will they tell us?
- Yes, anything.

1683
01:45:44,029 --> 01:45:48,178
My first wife eloped with someone,
ask him who she is with.

1684
01:45:48,258 --> 01:45:49,556
You!

1685
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:51,968
You may even ask me
to call your dead father.

1686
01:45:52,048 --> 01:45:53,658
You said they give
you all the information.

1687
01:45:53,738 --> 01:45:56,482
Sir, did anyone elope in your house?
- No one.

1688
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,550
I got the message,
I will talk to them.

1689
01:46:00,928 --> 01:46:02,361
Hi, hello, sir.

1690
01:46:02,563 --> 01:46:05,429
Myself Kumar, I am from Rajankunte.

1691
01:46:05,753 --> 01:46:07,766
This is Reliance Fresh number?
- 'Yes, sir.'

1692
01:46:07,955 --> 01:46:09,077
'What can I do for you?'

1693
01:46:09,157 --> 01:46:10,781
Sir, I want your appointment.

1694
01:46:10,976 --> 01:46:14,024
I own 10 acres of
land near Rajankunte.

1695
01:46:14,104 --> 01:46:16,143
I want to sell vegetables.
- 'You can come to our office.'

1696
01:46:16,338 --> 01:46:17,300
'Talk to the manager.'
- Okay, sir.

1697
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:18,808
'They'll explain you.'
- Okay, sir.

1698
01:46:18,998 --> 01:46:20,468
Father-in-law!

1699
01:46:22,371 --> 01:46:23,495
Father-in-law!

1700
01:46:24,478 --> 01:46:26,144
Father-in-law!

1701
01:46:26,224 --> 01:46:27,657
Who is it?
- Father-in-law!

1702
01:46:29,073 --> 01:46:31,305
Who are you?
- Mrs. Girija.

1703
01:46:32,395 --> 01:46:34,505
Father-in-law has
told a lot about you.

1704
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:37,592
'Girija is like this, like that'...

1705
01:46:37,869 --> 01:46:40,161
You look the same.
- Are you Kirti?

1706
01:46:41,476 --> 01:46:43,421
Oh, please come inside.

1707
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:47,045
Your father-in-law
has told much about you.

1708
01:46:47,685 --> 01:46:49,787
What are you planning
to turn my husband into?

1709
01:46:50,011 --> 01:46:52,234
This is just the beginning.
You have lots to see.

1710
01:46:53,401 --> 01:46:55,363
By the way, be careful.

1711
01:46:55,683 --> 01:46:59,627
Lady lecturers of our college
are eyeing on your husband.

1712
01:47:00,328 --> 01:47:02,682
His voice, his height...

1713
01:47:02,762 --> 01:47:04,024
...they keep staring at him.

1714
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:06,189
All the best.
- Hi, Kirti.

1715
01:47:07,892 --> 01:47:09,677
Kirti, when did you come?

1716
01:47:09,757 --> 01:47:12,804
Just now.
- What's going on in the college?

1717
01:47:13,303 --> 01:47:14,964
What?
- Let it be.

1718
01:47:15,289 --> 01:47:16,694
I will ask you after she leaves.

1719
01:47:17,192 --> 01:47:18,666
Hey, why are you holding
roses in your hand?

1720
01:47:18,746 --> 01:47:20,081
Today is Valentine's Day.

1721
01:47:20,161 --> 01:47:21,559
So...
- Is it for me?

1722
01:47:22,589 --> 01:47:23,524
I brought it for my boyfriend.

1723
01:47:24,825 --> 01:47:28,296
Will you make me stand here
or offer something...

1724
01:47:28,376 --> 01:47:29,303
I am sorry.

1725
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:31,722
Girija, the pudding is superb.

1726
01:47:32,088 --> 01:47:34,700
Thank you. I make nice pan cakes too.
Come, next time.

1727
01:47:34,999 --> 01:47:36,947
What will cook for afternoon?
- Beans and lentil curry.

1728
01:47:37,163 --> 01:47:38,935
Shall I make something else?
- No.

1729
01:47:39,483 --> 01:47:40,345
Kumar, come here.

1730
01:47:40,801 --> 01:47:42,798
What is it, Dad?
- She's my friend Kirti.

1731
01:47:43,002 --> 01:47:43,989
He's my son Kumar.

1732
01:47:44,441 --> 01:47:45,394
Hi.
- Hi.

1733
01:47:46,658 --> 01:47:47,721
Happy Valentine's Day.

1734
01:47:48,464 --> 01:47:50,678
Oh, thank you very much.
- Kumar.

1735
01:47:53,523 --> 01:47:55,034
Is it necessary now?

1736
01:47:55,167 --> 01:47:57,387
What?
- Why did you make pudding?

1737
01:47:57,815 --> 01:47:58,851
Mom, is there a festival today?

1738
01:47:59,369 --> 01:48:00,658
Don't you know my condition?

1739
01:48:01,437 --> 01:48:02,557
Okay, do whatever you want.

1740
01:48:05,593 --> 01:48:06,904
Okay Girija, I shall leave now.

1741
01:48:06,984 --> 01:48:08,139
I haven't brought my bike,
I will get late.

1742
01:48:08,219 --> 01:48:09,473
Why are you leaving?
Have lunch with us.

1743
01:48:09,553 --> 01:48:10,996
No, I'm getting late. No problem.

1744
01:48:11,076 --> 01:48:12,098
Kumar.
- Yes.

1745
01:48:12,417 --> 01:48:13,847
Looks like it's going to rain,
drop her home.

1746
01:48:13,927 --> 01:48:14,816
I can't do it.

1747
01:48:15,365 --> 01:48:17,282
Take my bike.
- Okay.

1748
01:48:18,093 --> 01:48:19,853
Dear, he'll drop you.
- I shall leave.

1749
01:48:19,933 --> 01:48:20,911
Bye.
- Bye.

1750
01:48:48,365 --> 01:48:51,514
I don't have guts to
apologize to you face to face.

1751
01:48:52,416 --> 01:48:53,595
Please forgive me.

1752
01:48:54,934 --> 01:48:56,235
Today is Valentine's Day.

1753
01:48:57,935 --> 01:48:59,485
I couldn't wish you...

1754
01:48:59,701 --> 01:49:01,644
...but you came home and wished me.

1755
01:49:03,016 --> 01:49:05,712
Why are you all so nice to me?

1756
01:49:06,028 --> 01:49:07,689
My parents love me very much.

1757
01:49:07,994 --> 01:49:09,291
I troubled them too.

1758
01:49:09,743 --> 01:49:10,956
You liked me very much.

1759
01:49:11,527 --> 01:49:13,091
But I couldn't impress you.

1760
01:49:13,325 --> 01:49:14,582
I want to request you one thing.

1761
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:16,451
Please leave me alone.

1762
01:49:19,671 --> 01:49:21,789
One can choose another option in life.

1763
01:49:22,766 --> 01:49:26,197
But you can't leave the one you love.

1764
01:49:27,733 --> 01:49:30,992
Do you know I don't like villains now?

1765
01:49:32,626 --> 01:49:35,629
Because you became a hero.

1766
01:49:49,311 --> 01:49:50,744
We'll meet in the theater tomorrow.
- Okay, dude.

1767
01:49:51,137 --> 01:49:51,973
Okay bye.
- Thank you.

1768
01:49:52,150 --> 01:49:53,456
Good morning, sir.

1769
01:49:54,369 --> 01:49:56,113
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning?

1770
01:49:57,604 --> 01:49:58,791
What's your avatar?

1771
01:49:59,074 --> 01:50:01,501
This is a college, not a circus.
You're roaming like a joker.

1772
01:50:02,162 --> 01:50:03,052
Sir...
- What is this?

1773
01:50:04,748 --> 01:50:06,528
How dare you wear goggles before me?
Remove them!

1774
01:50:07,897 --> 01:50:08,779
Give it to me.

1775
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:12,482
This dress doesn't match your age.

1776
01:50:13,589 --> 01:50:15,958
Who told you to wear it?
- Actually...

1777
01:50:17,778 --> 01:50:18,736
My friends told me...

1778
01:50:18,816 --> 01:50:20,587
If they say,
will you roam in an underwear?

1779
01:50:21,355 --> 01:50:24,123
Hey, this is the last warning, you
shouldn't come to the college like this.

1780
01:50:24,385 --> 01:50:26,101
You will ruin the college.

1781
01:50:26,181 --> 01:50:27,524
Get going! Go!

1782
01:50:28,061 --> 01:50:28,971
Get your parents.

1783
01:50:29,051 --> 01:50:30,305
Sir, my glasses.
- I won't give it to you. Go.

1784
01:50:31,222 --> 01:50:32,893
He's jealous of me.

1785
01:50:37,876 --> 01:50:41,006
Sir, I want to sell vegetables.
Who do I meet?

1786
01:50:41,442 --> 01:50:43,083
We can't buy it from
you just like that.

1787
01:50:43,163 --> 01:50:45,324
We have quality specification.

1788
01:50:45,404 --> 01:50:46,986
If it suits our criteria,
we'll surely buy it from you.

1789
01:50:47,066 --> 01:50:47,851
Okay, sir.

1790
01:50:48,025 --> 01:50:49,202
Okay, I will talk to him.

1791
01:50:49,805 --> 01:50:51,271
Okay, I will call you later. Wait.

1792
01:50:51,743 --> 01:50:54,329
Hello! Mr. Kumar.

1793
01:50:55,318 --> 01:50:57,751
Come inside.
- Sir, I have some work. I have to go.

1794
01:50:57,924 --> 01:51:00,089
Your Luna is punctured
and it is very hot outside.

1795
01:51:00,587 --> 01:51:02,641
You look very dull. Come inside.

1796
01:51:04,635 --> 01:51:06,727
Come, sit here.

1797
01:51:09,718 --> 01:51:12,277
You haven't come near
our house from so many days.

1798
01:51:13,742 --> 01:51:15,786
Sir, I made a mistake
by coming home that day.

1799
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:19,156
Please don't keep that in your mind.
Forgive me.

1800
01:51:19,717 --> 01:51:23,141
Let it be. You might have finished
your graduation this year, right?

1801
01:51:23,328 --> 01:51:25,764
No, sir. I got debarred.

1802
01:51:26,642 --> 01:51:28,081
I got caught while trying to copy.

1803
01:51:28,402 --> 01:51:29,598
So sad.

1804
01:51:31,474 --> 01:51:34,026
What did your parents say?
- Mom is very upset.

1805
01:51:34,751 --> 01:51:38,122
Dad is studying. I am paying his fees.
- Very good.

1806
01:51:39,772 --> 01:51:41,310
You've taken up responsibility.

1807
01:51:42,722 --> 01:51:44,901
Will you educate
my grandchildren nicely?

1808
01:51:47,425 --> 01:51:50,649
Kumar, I know everything.

1809
01:51:52,157 --> 01:51:55,032
You're educating your father, won't
you take good care of my daughter?

1810
01:51:56,799 --> 01:51:58,833
I am very proud of you.

1811
01:52:00,293 --> 01:52:03,282
Will you marry my daughter?

1812
01:52:07,205 --> 01:52:08,624
Sir, I am not worth.

1813
01:52:09,434 --> 01:52:11,544
I am toiling hard
to educate my father.

1814
01:52:12,153 --> 01:52:14,270
The day I become something,
I will come and talk to you.

1815
01:52:15,397 --> 01:52:16,509
I shall leave now.

1816
01:53:27,773 --> 01:53:30,353
Vijay, I'm sending
this to the company.

1817
01:53:31,012 --> 01:53:33,636
I've opened everyone's account.
Why do you worry?

1818
01:53:33,918 --> 01:53:36,880
I've written all the details
in this book. Keep it carefully.

1819
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:39,313
Sir, I'm doing this on your guarantee.

1820
01:53:48,102 --> 01:53:50,698
Father-in-law,
are you tensed about exams?

1821
01:53:51,645 --> 01:53:54,404
I am scared.
- Why are you scared?

1822
01:53:54,873 --> 01:53:56,109
Shall we go live on Facebook?

1823
01:53:56,392 --> 01:53:56,994
What do you mean?

1824
01:53:57,074 --> 01:53:57,986
Say 'Hi'.
- Hi.

1825
01:53:58,814 --> 01:54:00,107
Greetings to everyone.

1826
01:54:00,731 --> 01:54:02,285
My name is Shiva Kumar.

1827
01:54:02,839 --> 01:54:05,294
She is my best friend, Kirti.

1828
01:54:06,609 --> 01:54:08,497
She helps me a lot.

1829
01:54:08,577 --> 01:54:10,757
Not just her, everyone here.

1830
01:54:11,368 --> 01:54:12,604
Hi.

1831
01:54:13,108 --> 01:54:17,130
College staff and teachers
support me very much.

1832
01:54:18,187 --> 01:54:21,004
Above all, my wife...

1833
01:54:21,363 --> 01:54:24,457
...my son, people of our colony,
everyone is supporting me.

1834
01:54:24,537 --> 01:54:27,307
But I am tensed about
my exams because...

1835
01:54:27,446 --> 01:54:29,556
...I am 58 years old.

1836
01:54:30,234 --> 01:54:33,846
I don't remember what I have studied,
so I am worried.

1837
01:54:35,499 --> 01:54:39,819
But if you all bless me, I have a hope...

1838
01:54:40,318 --> 01:54:41,563
...that I will get pass in my exams.

1839
01:54:41,907 --> 01:54:45,627
So, please bless me.

1840
01:54:46,213 --> 01:54:47,257
Usually students think which college
they should get into...

1841
01:54:47,337 --> 01:54:48,228
Sir, coffee.

1842
01:54:48,308 --> 01:54:52,031
'They can go to the college for
graduation at 18 years of age.'

1843
01:54:52,111 --> 01:54:54,190
'But at the age of 54...'
- Sir, look at Kumar.

1844
01:54:54,270 --> 01:54:57,810
'He has become the talk
of the town by joining college.'

1845
01:54:58,053 --> 01:55:01,580
'54 years old Shiva Kumar
is studying in college...'

1846
01:55:01,660 --> 01:55:04,144
Sir, everyone is talking about him.

1847
01:55:04,282 --> 01:55:06,657
If he passes in the exam...

1848
01:55:06,906 --> 01:55:10,586
...all the old men of
Karnataka will join college.

1849
01:55:11,201 --> 01:55:13,332
He is very determined.

1850
01:55:17,091 --> 01:55:18,237
Even I.

1851
01:55:19,656 --> 01:55:21,704
I have planned something...

1852
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:24,230
...I will surely do it.

1853
01:55:25,399 --> 01:55:28,596
In the snake and mongoose fight, it's
not necessary that the snake will win.

1854
01:55:30,084 --> 01:55:31,544
The mongoose can also win.

1855
01:55:31,959 --> 01:55:35,315
Girija, your husband
has become famous on TV.

1856
01:55:35,395 --> 01:55:36,609
Did you see?
- Yes.

1857
01:55:37,010 --> 01:55:39,542
You also can get
your husband educated.

1858
01:55:39,622 --> 01:55:41,591
My husband doesn't need to study.
Come on, let's go.

1859
01:55:42,214 --> 01:55:45,099
You can erase alphabets,
but not your destiny.

1860
01:55:45,179 --> 01:55:47,105
He's coming on TV...

1861
01:55:47,185 --> 01:55:49,908
...tomorrow when he fails,
we all will know the truth.

1862
01:55:51,375 --> 01:55:53,378
Shiva Kumar may err...

1863
01:55:53,458 --> 01:55:55,609
...but not God.

1864
01:55:55,924 --> 01:55:58,420
Kumar will become famous one day...

1865
01:55:58,630 --> 01:56:00,130
...I knew it very before.

1866
01:56:00,501 --> 01:56:02,782
Once he was sleeping in my class.

1867
01:56:03,235 --> 01:56:05,803
I gave him a tight slap,
he reformed.

1868
01:56:06,096 --> 01:56:08,665
I'm happy that he
is studying at this age.

1869
01:56:08,826 --> 01:56:11,452
I appreciate that man. Good luck.

1870
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:18,810
Greetings, sir.
- Puttaraju.

1871
01:56:19,045 --> 01:56:21,104
Sir, tell me what it is.
Had you called me...

1872
01:56:21,826 --> 01:56:22,929
In your college...

1873
01:56:23,615 --> 01:56:25,819
...a man named Shiva Kumar
is studying.

1874
01:56:25,966 --> 01:56:26,692
Yes, sir.

1875
01:56:28,463 --> 01:56:29,423
Come here.

1876
01:56:32,411 --> 01:56:33,789
Sir, sir...

1877
01:56:34,261 --> 01:56:35,423
What is this, sir?

1878
01:56:36,004 --> 01:56:38,884
He shouldn't pass at any cost.

1879
01:56:40,049 --> 01:56:43,111
Sir, everyone bribes to get passed.

1880
01:56:43,841 --> 01:56:46,097
You are bribing me to fail him.

1881
01:56:46,499 --> 01:56:47,976
I am different.

1882
01:56:48,883 --> 01:56:50,470
You should do it without
anyone's knowledge.

1883
01:56:52,165 --> 01:56:53,579
Sir, forget this.

1884
01:56:53,809 --> 01:56:55,222
You can see his results.

1885
01:56:56,441 --> 01:56:57,515
Okay.

1886
01:57:06,689 --> 01:57:08,853
Dad, wake up.

1887
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:11,631
Wake up, Dad.
- What is it?

1888
01:57:11,711 --> 01:57:13,242
Hey, wake up. Don't try to act smart.

1889
01:57:13,895 --> 01:57:16,402
Why are you waking him up so early.
It's just 3:30 a.m.

1890
01:57:17,125 --> 01:57:19,277
He has exams. Get up and study.

1891
01:57:19,578 --> 01:57:22,359
Hey, I just went to sleep.
My eyes are burning.

1892
01:57:22,566 --> 01:57:24,891
I will get you a filter coffee,
it will drive away your sleep.

1893
01:57:25,077 --> 01:57:26,317
You used to wake me up, didn't you?

1894
01:57:26,397 --> 01:57:27,699
Mom, tell him to get ready.

1895
01:57:28,120 --> 01:57:29,500
Come on, wake up.

1896
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:31,220
Don't do drama, just get up and come.

1897
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:32,885
I am coming. Do over do it.

1898
01:57:34,716 --> 01:57:36,700
Have you studied well?
- Yes.

1899
01:57:37,385 --> 01:57:39,874
But I am scared.
- Why?

1900
01:57:40,387 --> 01:57:42,899
God will bless you.
Just write your exams well.

1901
01:57:44,767 --> 01:57:46,006
I shall leave.
- All the best.

1902
01:57:51,590 --> 01:57:53,576
He's not answering the phone.
It's been three days now.

1903
01:57:53,656 --> 01:57:55,091
Didn't I tell you he won't come?

1904
01:57:55,990 --> 01:57:57,727
We've given him
100 tones of vegetables.

1905
01:57:57,975 --> 01:57:59,768
We have to get 8 lakh rupees.

1906
01:58:00,023 --> 01:58:02,204
Shut up,
had you been smart enough...

1907
01:58:02,409 --> 01:58:03,820
...why would we have to trust him?

1908
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:06,450
He's a nice guy.
Wait for one more week.

1909
01:58:06,610 --> 01:58:07,866
We'll catch him later.

1910
01:58:08,082 --> 01:58:09,914
We can't wait, we'll barge in.

1911
01:58:09,994 --> 01:58:13,252
We'll go there,
thrash him, and recover the money.

1912
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:16,185
You say such things now,
after you get the money...

1913
01:58:16,265 --> 01:58:18,212
...you will stand outside his door.

1914
01:58:18,356 --> 01:58:19,942
Don't we know your status?

1915
01:58:25,717 --> 01:58:27,161
Tell me.
- Shiva.

1916
01:58:27,356 --> 01:58:29,016
Where are you?
- I am in the college.

1917
01:58:29,175 --> 01:58:33,686
There's news about
you in all the channels...

1918
01:58:33,766 --> 01:58:35,939
...even I have told my friends about you.

1919
01:58:36,019 --> 01:58:38,387
I know. Why did you call me?

1920
01:58:38,857 --> 01:58:44,330
Listen, don't pressurize
yourself too much...

1921
01:58:44,454 --> 01:58:47,458
...if there's a girl sitting
beside you in the exam hall...

1922
01:58:47,608 --> 01:58:49,705
...plead her to help you in the exams.

1923
01:58:49,785 --> 01:58:50,852
It's very easy.

1924
01:58:51,328 --> 01:58:52,136
Idiot.

1925
01:58:52,391 --> 01:58:55,964
Since you are jobless,
you give me stupid ideas.

1926
01:58:56,044 --> 01:58:57,500
I will kill you. Hang up the phone.

1927
01:58:57,580 --> 01:58:59,926
I tried to advice
you as you're my friend.

1928
01:59:00,121 --> 01:59:01,817
Never mind.

1929
01:59:01,976 --> 01:59:03,118
Hang up the phone.

1930
01:59:10,665 --> 01:59:12,364
Goddess, bless us.

1931
01:59:22,413 --> 01:59:25,119
My husband has project work today.

1932
01:59:26,066 --> 01:59:28,506
If he forgets anything,
please help him.

1933
01:59:35,665 --> 01:59:38,278
My husband has ecology exam today...

1934
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:39,840
...moreover in English.

1935
01:59:40,017 --> 01:59:42,901
You know he is not so good in English,
please help him.

1936
01:59:51,919 --> 01:59:52,904
Indian...

1937
01:59:56,082 --> 01:59:58,839
Indian Financial Operations.

1938
01:59:59,171 --> 02:00:01,795
Please bless him
to do well in the exam.

1939
02:00:10,459 --> 02:00:12,479
Sir, please wait.
- Come on.

1940
02:00:12,695 --> 02:00:13,479
Sir...

1941
02:00:13,559 --> 02:00:16,885
How is your preparation
for the sixth semester?

1942
02:00:17,062 --> 02:00:18,564
I am well prepared.

1943
02:00:18,644 --> 02:00:21,008
Sir, time up, I need to go.

1944
02:00:24,457 --> 02:00:26,605
Sir, I don't know what to say...

1945
02:00:26,813 --> 02:00:29,221
Shiva, you must not
go against the media.

1946
02:00:29,478 --> 02:00:30,882
Please answer their questions.

1947
02:00:30,962 --> 02:00:32,408
Have you planned
to cheat in the exams...

1948
02:00:32,488 --> 02:00:34,000
...or are you confident of passing
the exam honestly?

1949
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:36,604
Sir, I have studied hard.

1950
02:00:37,312 --> 02:00:39,461
I am getting late for the exam...

1951
02:00:39,894 --> 02:00:41,856
...then I won't be allowed
in the exam hall.

1952
02:00:41,936 --> 02:00:44,566
Please let me go.
- Stop. You think we are jobless?

1953
02:00:44,785 --> 02:00:46,595
You think you're a celebrity?

1954
02:01:05,844 --> 02:01:07,629
Sir, may I come in?
- Yes, come in.

1955
02:01:08,701 --> 02:01:10,099
Wait a minute.

1956
02:01:10,696 --> 02:01:12,600
It's been half-an-hour since
I distributed question papers...

1957
02:01:12,828 --> 02:01:16,275
...any of the students might
have leaked the question to you...

1958
02:01:16,557 --> 02:01:18,840
...and you might've prepared
chits to copy in the exam...

1959
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:20,023
Sir...

1960
02:01:20,621 --> 02:01:23,361
Sir, I don't do such things.
- Really?

1961
02:01:23,716 --> 02:01:26,062
I didn't have the intention to check you...
- Sir, please.

1962
02:01:26,142 --> 02:01:28,264
...but your son taught this to us.
- Sir, please.

1963
02:01:28,344 --> 02:01:29,483
Sir...

1964
02:01:30,345 --> 02:01:31,590
Go.

1965
02:01:31,888 --> 02:01:34,169
Don't waste time, go on.

1966
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:01,994
Sir... Please, sir.
- Time up.

1967
02:02:02,623 --> 02:02:04,096
Sir, they are still writing...

1968
02:02:04,176 --> 02:02:06,636
...there is still 15 minutes
grace time, please.

1969
02:02:06,775 --> 02:02:09,116
That's only for others not you.

1970
02:02:09,874 --> 02:02:13,981
It's a punishment for coming
half-an-hour late. You can go now.

1971
02:02:14,485 --> 02:02:16,258
Sir, please...

1972
02:02:16,338 --> 02:02:18,881
I told you,
you will have God's blessings.

1973
02:02:36,709 --> 02:02:38,833
Sir.
- What do I say?

1974
02:02:39,110 --> 02:02:43,337
People feel jealous seeing
someone living a happy life.

1975
02:02:43,503 --> 02:02:45,315
I don't understand
what you are saying?

1976
02:02:45,481 --> 02:02:50,255
Fearing that you
would pass in the exams...

1977
02:02:50,629 --> 02:02:53,908
...Vasu has made sure that you fail.

1978
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:56,856
What are you saying?

1979
02:02:56,936 --> 02:03:01,031
I know you very well, you won't
be able to bear the humiliation.

1980
02:03:01,319 --> 02:03:05,610
Listen to me.
Go to a faraway place for few days...

1981
02:03:05,903 --> 02:03:08,377
...after things settle down, come back.

1982
02:03:15,323 --> 02:03:18,223
I studied so hard
for all these years...

1983
02:03:20,857 --> 02:03:21,964
Kumar!

1984
02:03:22,618 --> 02:03:25,098
People in the locality
have taken leave...

1985
02:03:25,178 --> 02:03:26,638
...they are putting up stage in the ground
because it's your result tomorrow.

1986
02:03:26,820 --> 02:03:28,220
Why are you sullen?

1987
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:29,631
You will pass in the exams, won't you?

1988
02:03:29,797 --> 02:03:32,294
I need to put up buntings, bye.

1989
02:03:56,682 --> 02:03:57,983
Why are you sitting alone, dad?

1990
02:03:58,502 --> 02:03:59,879
It's result day tomorrow, Kumar.

1991
02:04:00,335 --> 02:04:01,891
I am nervous.

1992
02:04:02,210 --> 02:04:04,472
Don't worry, everything will be fine.

1993
02:04:04,552 --> 02:04:05,822
I have done well in the exams.

1994
02:04:06,528 --> 02:04:08,396
But...
- But?

1995
02:04:08,714 --> 02:04:10,589
Don't worry about the results.

1996
02:04:10,845 --> 02:04:12,243
Even if you failed in the exams...

1997
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:14,585
...I will make you take up exams again.

1998
02:04:19,096 --> 02:04:21,277
When you were studying,
I have never told this to you.

1999
02:04:22,071 --> 02:04:26,159
I used to pressurize you
to do extremely well in the exams.

2000
02:04:29,257 --> 02:04:31,858
You turned out to be
a better father than me.

2001
02:04:32,428 --> 02:04:34,445
No, I have erred too.

2002
02:04:34,839 --> 02:04:37,916
Had I obeyed you,
I wouldn't have been in this state.

2003
02:04:38,347 --> 02:04:39,277
No, Kumar.

2004
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:43,196
I told in front of people that
I would pursue education at this age...

2005
02:04:44,036 --> 02:04:45,800
...and if I failed...

2006
02:04:46,596 --> 02:04:48,814
...it will be such a shame.

2007
02:04:50,332 --> 02:04:53,220
The media has made it big news.

2008
02:04:54,941 --> 02:04:58,157
Seeing all this,
I wonder if I will be alive...

2009
02:04:58,495 --> 02:05:02,026
Dad, please control yourself.

2010
02:05:03,843 --> 02:05:07,016
I ruined the life that you gave me...

2011
02:05:07,375 --> 02:05:09,351
...I now understand
the real value of life.

2012
02:05:10,083 --> 02:05:13,141
I have understood how much you have
toiled only after taking your place.

2013
02:05:15,016 --> 02:05:18,309
I don't deserve to be forgiven.

2014
02:05:18,489 --> 02:05:22,149
Kumar, if I fail in the exams...

2015
02:05:22,855 --> 02:05:24,986
...please forgive me.
- Father...

2016
02:05:25,186 --> 02:05:27,062
Please forgive me.
- Father, nothing as such will happen.

2017
02:05:27,273 --> 02:05:29,464
Father, please don't cry.

2018
02:05:30,366 --> 02:05:31,838
Father, nothing as such will happen.

2019
02:05:32,220 --> 02:05:33,842
Okay? Come.

2020
02:05:34,335 --> 02:05:36,444
Come and sleep.

2021
02:05:52,421 --> 02:05:53,535
Father!

2022
02:05:54,580 --> 02:05:56,867
Father!

2023
02:05:57,620 --> 02:05:58,788
My God!

2024
02:06:00,626 --> 02:06:01,634
Father!

2025
02:06:02,518 --> 02:06:04,528
Kumar!
- Father!

2026
02:06:05,694 --> 02:06:06,792
Father!

2027
02:06:07,851 --> 02:06:09,373
My God!
- Father!

2028
02:06:10,992 --> 02:06:12,216
Father!

2029
02:06:13,261 --> 02:06:15,261
Kumar!
- What happened, mother?

2030
02:06:15,341 --> 02:06:17,841
Your father is not to
be seen anywhere since morning.

2031
02:06:17,921 --> 02:06:20,850
He left even before I woke up.
Look here.

2032
02:06:21,474 --> 02:06:22,940
He has also left his phone behind.

2033
02:06:23,181 --> 02:06:24,598
I am scared.

2034
02:06:25,140 --> 02:06:27,105
Mother, don't be afraid.

2035
02:06:27,315 --> 02:06:29,601
Enquire the neighbors, I will look for him.
- Okay.

2036
02:06:37,897 --> 02:06:42,474
'The people of the state
are anxiously waiting to know...'

2037
02:06:42,554 --> 02:06:45,357
'...the exam result of
54  years old Shiva Kumar.'

2038
02:06:45,437 --> 02:06:47,802
'Another thing what
brings to notice is...'

2039
02:06:48,010 --> 02:06:50,339
'...the internet servers
in the state are down.'

2040
02:06:50,419 --> 02:06:53,643
'The results were not
uploaded on the website.'

2041
02:06:54,685 --> 02:06:56,516
Sir. Did you see my father?
- Yes.

2042
02:06:56,842 --> 02:06:57,943
No.
- No.

2043
02:06:59,731 --> 02:07:03,273
Have you taken the weapons?
- Yes.

2044
02:07:03,644 --> 02:07:05,897
Tell me.
- I enquired everything...

2045
02:07:06,086 --> 02:07:08,363
...it's precisely 20 kms from here.

2046
02:07:08,598 --> 02:07:09,634
Shall we go?
- Let's go.

2047
02:07:19,600 --> 02:07:21,917
Shailaja, did you see my husband?

2048
02:07:21,997 --> 02:07:23,640
No, I haven't seen him.
- Okay.

2049
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:27,814
'54 years old Shiva Kumar has
made big news by joining college.'

2050
02:07:27,894 --> 02:07:32,392
'Shiva Kumar's final
semester result is out.'

2051
02:07:32,690 --> 02:07:35,143
'Let's find out whether he
has passed in the exams or failed.'

2052
02:07:56,162 --> 02:07:58,058
Nani!

2053
02:07:59,115 --> 02:08:01,239
Nani!

2054
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,553
Nani! Father!

2055
02:08:19,185 --> 02:08:20,742
Hello.
- Buddy.

2056
02:08:20,998 --> 02:08:22,698
Your father's exam result
is on the notice board.

2057
02:08:22,778 --> 02:08:23,764
Is that so?

2058
02:08:33,164 --> 02:08:34,175
Ratnamma.
- Yes.

2059
02:08:34,255 --> 02:08:35,441
Did you see my husband?

2060
02:08:35,614 --> 02:08:36,990
No, I didn't.

2061
02:08:52,454 --> 02:08:53,671
Chandu.
- Ma'am?

2062
02:08:53,751 --> 02:08:54,767
Did you see my husband?

2063
02:08:54,847 --> 02:08:55,969
I am not finding him.

2064
02:08:56,185 --> 02:08:57,740
No, ma'am. Do one thing.

2065
02:08:57,895 --> 02:08:59,284
Exam result is out today,
go to the college and check.

2066
02:08:59,599 --> 02:09:00,973
That's right.

2067
02:09:01,053 --> 02:09:02,407
Okay.
- Okay.

2068
02:09:17,638 --> 02:09:21,230
Mr. Shiva Kumar who joined
college by challenging his son...

2069
02:09:21,363 --> 02:09:24,058
...has passed three years
in a row without any backlogs...

2070
02:09:24,222 --> 02:09:27,350
...everyone is waiting for
the result of the final semester.

2071
02:09:28,961 --> 02:09:30,241
Stop!
- Open the gate!

2072
02:09:33,881 --> 02:09:36,472
He will surely pass.
- He will surely pass.

2073
02:09:36,552 --> 02:09:39,151
It is impossible.
- It is impossible.

2074
02:09:39,231 --> 02:09:42,274
I also have been waiting for the result.
- I have faith in my student.

2075
02:09:47,268 --> 02:09:48,858
Did you see my father?

2076
02:09:48,938 --> 02:09:50,181
No, I haven't.

2077
02:09:50,301 --> 02:09:51,257
Please tell me the truth.

2078
02:09:51,337 --> 02:09:52,147
Did you see him?
- No, I haven't.

2079
02:09:52,227 --> 02:09:54,174
No, I haven't.
- Don't irritate us, go away.

2080
02:09:54,254 --> 02:09:55,809
What's his problem?

2081
02:10:03,729 --> 02:10:05,618
Sir, did you see my father?

2082
02:10:06,532 --> 02:10:07,660
Kumar.

2083
02:10:09,057 --> 02:10:11,755
I am here to wish him
but I couldn't find him.

2084
02:10:26,728 --> 02:10:28,602
Mahesh, Shiva Kumar is missing.

2085
02:10:28,682 --> 02:10:30,079
What?
- Call me if you find him.

2086
02:10:30,159 --> 02:10:31,051
Okay.

2087
02:10:54,194 --> 02:10:55,417
You have failed.

2088
02:11:04,246 --> 02:11:05,774
Kirti, Shiva Kumar...

2089
02:11:06,023 --> 02:11:07,372
Come with me, I will tell you.

2090
02:11:07,618 --> 02:11:08,808
Where is he?
- Come with me.

2091
02:11:13,037 --> 02:11:16,120
Viji, the money has been credited
to our account, look at the message.

2092
02:11:18,854 --> 02:11:20,930
Let's go, we were in haste.

2093
02:11:22,292 --> 02:11:23,938
Sir, shake hand.

2094
02:11:24,323 --> 02:11:25,386
Is the job done?

2095
02:11:25,552 --> 02:11:27,190
He has passed in first class.

2096
02:11:29,371 --> 02:11:31,280
Sir, take your money.

2097
02:11:31,790 --> 02:11:33,052
Sir, I am a peon...

2098
02:11:33,522 --> 02:11:34,906
...and Shiva Kumar was a peon too.

2099
02:11:35,277 --> 02:11:36,417
He has own today...

2100
02:11:37,014 --> 02:11:40,202
...he has been an
inspiration to all of us.

2101
02:11:41,388 --> 02:11:44,193
Sir, never mind
if we don't encourage a person...

2102
02:11:44,786 --> 02:11:46,435
...but we shouldn't discourage him.

2103
02:11:46,972 --> 02:11:48,029
Goodbye.

2104
02:11:53,370 --> 02:11:54,335
Mother...
- Did you find father?

2105
02:11:54,415 --> 02:11:56,235
No. Father has passed
in the exams...

2106
02:11:56,315 --> 02:11:57,292
...he has passed in first class.

2107
02:11:57,372 --> 02:11:58,626
What?
- Yes.

2108
02:11:59,471 --> 02:12:01,618
Thank God, but I am not finding him.

2109
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:03,242
Even I am looking for him.

2110
02:12:03,554 --> 02:12:04,903
Kirti, did you find him?
- What happened?

2111
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:06,453
I saw him.

2112
02:12:06,604 --> 02:12:07,491
Where?
- Near the ground.

2113
02:12:07,571 --> 02:12:08,274
Let's go.

2114
02:12:08,354 --> 02:12:11,165
'There's rumor that Mr. Shiva Kumar
has attempted suicide...'

2115
02:12:11,245 --> 02:12:14,801
'...fearing that he would
fail in the exams.'

2116
02:12:20,992 --> 02:12:22,298
It seems Kumar is there.
- Where?

2117
02:12:22,378 --> 02:12:23,718
Let's go and see, sir.

2118
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:44,775
Father! Father, get up!
- Dear!

2119
02:12:44,914 --> 02:12:46,006
Oh, my God!
- Father!

2120
02:12:46,086 --> 02:12:47,470
Why is he sleeping like this?

2121
02:12:47,704 --> 02:12:49,121
Father!
- What has happened to him?

2122
02:12:49,201 --> 02:12:50,283
Bring water.

2123
02:12:52,607 --> 02:12:54,048
Dear!
- What's this?

2124
02:12:54,128 --> 02:12:55,213
What's this?

2125
02:12:55,589 --> 02:12:57,333
Why did you do like this?

2126
02:12:59,552 --> 02:13:01,871
Dear... Get up.
- Father...

2127
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:04,644
Father!

2128
02:13:04,724 --> 02:13:05,912
Look...

2129
02:13:06,460 --> 02:13:08,345
Call the ambulance.
- Move.

2130
02:13:10,107 --> 02:13:11,934
There is no need
to call the ambulance.

2131
02:13:15,306 --> 02:13:19,055
Shiva, you have finally won.

2132
02:13:19,839 --> 02:13:21,156
You have won, Shiva.

2133
02:13:21,483 --> 02:13:24,388
You have finally won, get up.

2134
02:13:25,427 --> 02:13:29,885
Did you see who is saying this to you?

2135
02:13:30,632 --> 02:13:32,067
Get up.
- Shiva Kumar...

2136
02:13:32,147 --> 02:13:33,467
...you have passed in first class.

2137
02:13:33,660 --> 02:13:34,801
Get up.

2138
02:13:35,382 --> 02:13:38,150
You have passed in the exams.
- You have passed in the exams.

2139
02:13:38,488 --> 02:13:40,973
Dear, You have passed...

2140
02:13:48,263 --> 02:13:49,445
Father...
- Dear...

2141
02:13:53,555 --> 02:13:54,781
Father, get up slowly.

2142
02:14:01,088 --> 02:14:02,478
You have passed in the exams.

2143
02:14:17,982 --> 02:14:19,194
On one side is his achievement...

2144
02:14:19,314 --> 02:14:23,024
...on the other, he has recovered
from the bed of death.

2145
02:14:24,474 --> 02:14:27,215
He finally became an auditor.

2146
02:14:27,606 --> 02:14:30,523
Sir, I have checked the details
completely and there is no problem.

2147
02:14:30,603 --> 02:14:32,260
Thank you. Okay, sir.
- I will check the income tax file.

2148
02:14:32,410 --> 02:14:34,137
'His son didn't turn
out to be a wastrel...'

2149
02:14:34,629 --> 02:14:38,145
'...believing in hard work,
he started a big organic firm.'

2150
02:14:38,620 --> 02:14:42,256
'He grew up to be successful providing
employment to hundreds of people.'

2151
02:14:42,627 --> 02:14:46,358
'To satiate hunger, the person
who is hungry only should eat.'

2152
02:14:47,015 --> 02:14:51,244
'To make dream come true, only the
person who saw it must fulfill it.'

2153
02:14:52,384 --> 02:14:55,241
'You should carry the burden
of your desires yourself.'

2154
02:14:55,523 --> 02:14:58,024
'You should achieve
your goal yourself.'

2155
02:14:58,218 --> 02:15:01,528
'It is the law of nature,
this is how life is.'
