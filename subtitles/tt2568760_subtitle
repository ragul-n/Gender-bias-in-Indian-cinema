1
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:46,345
There is just a week to the marriage
Are you done with the purchases?

2
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:48,281
What is it?

3
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:50,983
Have you purchased the jewellery?

4
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,218
My folks will handle that

5
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:58,285
The number can be compromised on,
but not the weight of the jewellery

6
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:03,658
The joke did not get across!

7
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:15,837
Why do you look so tensed?
Are you tensed about the marriage?

8
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,409
No, not at all!

9
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:19,606
Why are you looking up at the skies?

10
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:25,117
I have not seen a flight landing
Can we go, see that?

11
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:27,289
What is there so great in that?

12
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:30,151
Can we go, see, just for the heck of it?

13
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:32,986
Fine, let's go

14
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,799
Stop here

15
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:03,153
Why did you ask me to stop here?
Can we go, sit in the gallery?

16
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:06,521
This is just apt for us

17
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,142
Come this side

18
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:22,836
What is it?

19
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:24,174
Come, stand this side

20
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:33,187
There is no flight to be seen

21
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:34,651
Look at that

22
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:16,122
Doctor, I will be around in case of
any emergency for blood or so

23
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:33,171
Did you inform people at home?

24
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,615
Yes, I have called and informed them

25
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:15,273
Madam, get in

26
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:32,456
You seem to be here right in time as
I leave everyday

27
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:33,921
Do you live close-by?

28
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:37,931
I live close-by and I know you leave home
at this time everyday

29
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:42,604
I just consider getting a customer even
before I reach the auto-stand everyday

30
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:43,865
So, I am liable for a discount

31
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:46,032
Yes, of course, as you say!

32
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,970
Hey, I don't want any discounts

33
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:01,682
Take this

34
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:02,789
Okay, madam

35
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:08,256
Brother, is it absolute drought for you?

36
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:10,628
No... floods do happen here as well

37
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,049
Hey, we are not sitting here for nothing

38
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:29,845
What is the problem?

39
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:31,146
Nothing at all
Give me a minute

40
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:33,149
Brother, I need to talk to you

41
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:37,649
Please do not create an issue
She is my personal customer

42
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,625
I drop her in the morning
and pick up in the evening

43
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:40,661
Do not create a problem right now

44
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:43,630
If she is your personal customer,
drive her around in a car

45
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,390
Shall I lodge a complaint with the union?

46
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,024
Please, let me go

47
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:48,000
She is the only one
whom I pick up from here

48
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,108
- So, floods do happen for you as well!
- What is it?

49
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,371
Illiterates! Just don't bother

50
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,864
- See you tomorrow
- Okay, madam

51
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:34,614
Oh no...

52
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:57,972
The most memorable days for most of us,
are the days we fall in love

53
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:01,338
Call me now and talk about your love life

54
00:11:01,444 --> 00:11:02,934
Oh, you are back!

55
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:06,638
To tell about your love life...

56
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,912
Call me on 6603935

57
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:16,821
Longing to hear from you all
It's 'love on air', 93.5, Red FM

58
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,724
Listen... listen to it always!

59
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:23,262
Shall I serve you dinner?

60
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:25,231
I have had mine
You can carry on with yours'

61
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:41,475
Mother is there...

62
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,242
Reach me home as soon as possible...

63
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:10,573
...and then drop me at airport
after I have fetched my bags

64
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,646
It is urgent!

65
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:15,106
Can you drive fast in this traffic?

66
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:20,312
There is a small road inside which is
longer, but can reach you sooner

67
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:21,447
Okay...

68
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:57,748
This is blocked from here

69
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,088
What do we do now?

70
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:01,289
We can try this way

71
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:37,054
Madam, please wait and listen to me

72
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,600
Madam, please wait

73
00:17:27,362 --> 00:17:28,386
Sofi, why are you late?

74
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:30,988
Sorry sir, I had guests at home

75
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,945
It is not like that, Sofi

76
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:04,626
Music should feel soothing always

77
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,202
Law is not made for the public alone,
but also for us

78
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,806
This is a hospital

79
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:55,137
If a policeman smokes here...

80
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:57,405
...the public will then
smoke inside the operation theaters

81
00:19:57,512 --> 00:19:58,877
Have you done the reports?

82
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:01,211
I was waiting for you to come
and then do the reports

83
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:05,344
Why were you asked to come here?

84
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,015
You were expected to do the reports
before I reach here

85
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,149
Sir, you just need to be there

86
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:13,221
I will handle the rest of it

87
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:33,707
The head was hit hard here and that has
caused the blood to clot in the brain

88
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:37,376
Also, here at these places too

89
00:20:55,037 --> 00:21:01,943
The death was due to these
2 blows on the head

90
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:28,163
He, recently got transferred
here from Alleppey

91
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,363
This reaction is because of that

92
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:56,264
You know me too well

93
00:21:56,365 --> 00:22:02,201
That was the reason I sent you here
to do the reports before I got here

94
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,412
After dinner, Vipin and Sandhya left
the restaurant, got into the car...

95
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:19,544
...and reached the place of the incident
to watch a flight landing

96
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:24,148
A flight landing?
What is there to see in it?

97
00:22:24,993 --> 00:22:26,221
Who knows!

98
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:33,359
2 guys came on a bike, stopped there
and 1 among them attacked Vipin

99
00:22:33,468 --> 00:22:39,896
A passer-by rescues them,
trying to catch hold of the accused

100
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:40,975
Then...

101
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,976
I do not know anything after that

102
00:22:46,214 --> 00:22:52,710
I was totally shaken with sudden shock,
not knowing what to do next

103
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:13,332
Why did you both go and stand in a dark,
lonely place like that to see a flight land?

104
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:17,003
Is there a law that says
we are not supposed to stand there?

105
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:19,808
We just felt like standing there
That's it!

106
00:23:40,268 --> 00:23:43,635
If you had not interfered,
I would have made her say it all

107
00:23:46,141 --> 00:23:50,908
We do not have any solid evidences
against her to question her

108
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,981
So, why do you get so hassled?

109
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:59,520
Let us go and meet that passer-by
who rescued them

110
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:14,128
Ramachandran...

111
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:18,401
Your parents named you that, isn't it?

112
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:25,342
I stopped the bike,
shouted and reached near them

113
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:27,745
He hit me with a stick
and I hit him back too

114
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:30,340
I ran behind him

115
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:33,816
He got hit hard once and was bleeding

116
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:36,755
You had seen the blood marks
on that stick too

117
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,950
But, he escaped!

118
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:44,621
Tell me, how you happened
to reach that place at the right time

119
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:54,032
Tell me, how you happened
to reach that place at the right time

120
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,974
My house is a kilometer away from there

121
00:24:58,146 --> 00:25:00,171
So, I had to cross that place to reach home

122
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:07,318
Did you feel anything unusual there?

123
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:08,589
No sir

124
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:11,587
He was unconscious
and bleeding profusely

125
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:14,856
The girl was in a state of shock

126
00:25:14,963 --> 00:25:19,127
She did not attend to the many messages
that kept pinging on her phone then

127
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:21,196
She was really shocked

128
00:27:47,782 --> 00:27:50,273
Are you trying to corner me
with this call summary?

129
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,347
It is not for making the call

130
00:27:52,454 --> 00:27:56,891
You have to answer why you had
to message the accused, lmmanuel...

131
00:27:57,325 --> 00:28:00,556
...just before the incident took place

132
00:28:00,662 --> 00:28:03,688
Immanuel was a good friend of ours'...

133
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:07,097
...but I do not know
what revenge he had against Vipin

134
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:08,169
See...!

135
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:12,699
Have your tea

136
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,502
Excuse me

137
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:49,202
- Thanks, sir
- Have it

138
00:28:52,046 --> 00:28:53,877
Your plan has flopped

139
00:28:55,183 --> 00:29:00,678
Sandhya says that, you did it out of
some revenge against Vipin

140
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:06,352
There is no proof against her
She will walk out scot free

141
00:29:06,461 --> 00:29:08,554
You are in trouble

142
00:29:09,397 --> 00:29:12,423
What grave revenge
did you have against Vipin...

143
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:16,026
...to commit a murder
like this at such a young age?

144
00:29:16,738 --> 00:29:22,506
It is a big problem
Court... punishment... jail

145
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:25,578
You will have to suffer a lot

146
00:29:26,414 --> 00:29:31,442
Talk your heart out to someone
and relieve yourself

147
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:34,644
I did this for that bitch

148
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,718
Which bitch?

149
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,720
Sandhya...

150
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,660
There are only incoming calls on this
No outgoing calls!

151
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,868
I warned her against it several times

152
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:54,738
But, she forced me saying that
I can marry her only if I killed him

153
00:29:54,843 --> 00:29:57,812
I did not do it intentionally, sir!

154
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:03,344
I killed him for such a female

155
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:12,024
She planned it all

156
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:17,029
She told me that she will bring him
to that spot near the airport

157
00:30:17,465 --> 00:30:20,559
I reached there for that

158
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:24,964
I did this for her, sir

159
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,044
Have I trimmed down a little?

160
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:38,178
- Has he?
- Yes, a bit

161
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:41,585
- Yes, a bit
- Not just a bit, Alex!

162
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:44,249
I had been really tensed ever since
this case had started

163
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:48,591
The pressure was worse
because he is the son of a retired judge

164
00:30:48,696 --> 00:30:52,325
We could have closed
the case with this boy

165
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:58,463
It is your brilliance that has traced
the girl's involvement in this case

166
00:30:58,573 --> 00:31:03,203
No CBI or crime branch,
will look down on us anymore

167
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:07,270
You are eligible for a promotion

168
00:31:08,383 --> 00:31:11,875
Sir, I need to talk to you
about something

169
00:31:11,986 --> 00:31:16,286
- Yes, tell me...
- I am planning to quit the job

170
00:31:16,391 --> 00:31:18,154
Quit?

171
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:23,155
Now, when you stand chance for a promotion
with an excellent service record?

172
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:25,162
Have you gone mad?

173
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:26,824
Yes, I feel so saturated

174
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:34,765
I, wish to go back home
and take to farming with my mother

175
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:37,538
Your hard work, commitment...

176
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:41,479
...and intelligence is
what you have solved the cases with

177
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:45,950
You are one among the best officers
to the Kerala Police

178
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:57,493
You have some other problems

179
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:01,494
Tell me what it is
and we can solve it

180
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:04,037
But, not quit the job

181
00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:07,697
Tell me...

182
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:24,253
Why did you leave
without telling him the actual reason?

183
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:36,536
I want to gift you something, sir
A reverant's attire!

184
00:32:36,838 --> 00:32:38,738
It will suit you well

185
00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:45,269
My father and grandfather were all cops

186
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,144
But, does that mean
I need to be a cop as well?

187
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:51,149
Family status, it seems
All crap!

188
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,419
Case, murder and corpse...

189
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:57,548
Why should I suffer all this?

190
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,044
- Sir, I have a complaint
- Move away and don't disturb him

191
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:34,528
She is here to tell us about her problems

192
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:38,258
If you scare her away,
whom will she tell it to?

193
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:41,392
Let her talk it out
Ask her to come in

194
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:00,350
Yes, come in

195
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:08,219
Tell me

196
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:15,702
My husband is missing since 2 days now
He used to drive an auto-rickshaw

197
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:21,036
I, did check with his friends too
Nobody has a clue

198
00:34:22,677 --> 00:34:28,638
Sir, please do find him for me

199
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:35,051
An ill mother and this, one-legged me,
have only him

200
00:34:35,356 --> 00:34:42,524
- Did you both fight at home?
- Nothing at all

201
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:47,595
Has he gone, missing like this before?

202
00:34:48,035 --> 00:34:48,933
No

203
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:55,666
Talk to the writer
and lodge a complaint now

204
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:59,011
We will enquire about it

205
00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:03,539
His...

206
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:07,412
Have you brought
his photograph with you?

207
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,884
Here it is

208
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:25,229
You need not lodge a complaint

209
00:35:25,473 --> 00:35:32,106
We may have a case against him soon
We will arrest him and inform you then

210
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,182
You can come and see him then
Fine, carry on...

211
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:39,852
He is not like that now
He takes good care of us

212
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:44,323
Didn't you hear me?

213
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:58,799
Sofi, there is no class
for the next 2 days

214
00:35:58,906 --> 00:35:59,736
Okay, sir

215
00:37:25,593 --> 00:37:27,618
Why did you run out of the vehicle?

216
00:37:27,728 --> 00:37:30,492
I felt something was not right about
the way he had behaved then

217
00:37:30,598 --> 00:37:35,433
It was twilight hour, on an unfamiliar route
and it looked like a plan to me

218
00:37:35,536 --> 00:37:39,563
I had gone to Delhi
to attend a medical conference

219
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,768
She was on her way to come to me,
when she left home that day

220
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,117
You were close
to this auto driver, isn't it?

221
00:37:50,818 --> 00:37:55,050
She knew him just for 2 to 3 days

222
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:58,523
He used to drop her to office
in the morning

223
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:02,790
It was not the kind of familiarity
that you are considering it was

224
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:10,869
Roy, I did not mean to ask you like that
It is a part of the enquiry

225
00:38:11,105 --> 00:38:14,802
I got back home the very next day
after I got to know about this incident

226
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,471
This incident happened
the day before yesterday...

227
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:24,210
...you reached here yesterday
and you are lodging a complaint today

228
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:26,878
Why was there so much of delay?

229
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:33,691
She was not like this when I got back
She was sitting alone and scared at home

230
00:38:33,794 --> 00:38:36,285
I had to pacify her a lot

231
00:38:38,332 --> 00:38:40,698
Do you remember the number of the vehicle?

232
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:41,699
No, I don't

233
00:38:41,802 --> 00:38:48,970
It was a familiar vehicle
So how can you not know it's number?

234
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:54,107
Sir, we all travel in cars, buses
and auto-rickshaws

235
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:57,514
Do we travel looking at
the number plates?

236
00:38:57,618 --> 00:39:01,452
Can a lady who is being chased,
write down the number of the vehicle?

237
00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:09,391
- Bag
- What is it?

238
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:13,394
Her phone and wallet were in her
hand-bag in the vehicle

239
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:20,937
Please lodge a complaint stating
all the details

240
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:25,608
Please wait...

241
00:39:28,649 --> 00:39:30,207
Was this the guy?

242
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,153
Yes, it is him

243
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:36,823
Okay, carry on

244
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,970
How are things, sir?

245
00:39:54,341 --> 00:39:55,433
What things?

246
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,644
The promotion that Varma sir
had spoken about

247
00:39:59,346 --> 00:40:03,248
I don't believe it till it actually happens

248
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:06,114
Why are you so eager about my promotion?

249
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,917
You are making the criminals confess...

250
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:14,120
...and take communion in the police
station to repent for their crimes

251
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:19,526
I am longing to live
like a real cop after you leave

252
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:23,535
You mean a real cop who makes
the criminals sit on imaginary chairs...

253
00:40:23,637 --> 00:40:26,071
...and keeps poking them with pins?

254
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,677
Why have you stopped here?
Is it to get pins?

255
00:40:33,047 --> 00:40:34,605
Look at that

256
00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:54,833
The bag is here with all the details
that they had spoken about

257
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:56,832
Nothing has been lost

258
00:40:56,937 --> 00:40:58,962
There is nothing else over here

259
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:02,303
Ramachandran, do not be
too sure about that

260
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,246
He attempted something here...

261
00:41:16,357 --> 00:41:21,317
...and when he feared to get caught,
Raghavan has absconded

262
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:23,657
Can we close this case?

263
00:41:25,299 --> 00:41:30,999
But how will a moving vehicle
get punctured on its own?

264
00:41:36,043 --> 00:41:41,003
The appointment for 4:30
can be postponed to 5:30

265
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,009
Don't take in any more
appointments for today

266
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,284
Okay

267
00:41:56,463 --> 00:41:58,328
- Sir, why are you here?
- Can I come in?

268
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:02,226
- Didn't you go to the hospital today?
- No, I did not

269
00:42:03,037 --> 00:42:05,369
I had visited the spot of the incident

270
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:08,671
We have found your wife's handbag and
nothing has been lost

271
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,810
Please come to the station, sign
the statement and take the bag

272
00:42:11,912 --> 00:42:14,278
We are still investigating
about that man

273
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:16,474
You did not have to come
this far to tell me this

274
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:20,577
- You could have just called me up
- I wanted to meet you as well

275
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:24,924
We have met before

276
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,051
Yes, we did during Harsha's case

277
00:42:28,195 --> 00:42:32,325
Yes, Harsha Vardhan!
Where is he now?

278
00:42:32,433 --> 00:42:37,063
He is busy with a new music project
and is staying away from the city

279
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:40,900
I want to meet him
Can I have his contact number?

280
00:42:41,008 --> 00:42:43,806
I do not have his number
I will get it the next time I meet him

281
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:50,475
How is that possible, Roy?
How can you not have a friends' number?

282
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:52,716
Take a right from
the Eramalloor junction...

283
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,482
...then the second left and his
house is the last one there

284
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,285
You can collect the handbag from
the station

285
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:09,627
<i>There is no logic in him saying that he</i>
<i>does not know his friends' number</i>

286
00:43:10,738 --> 00:43:14,731
<i>But, he has given me</i>
<i>the directions to his house</i>

287
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:21,745
<i>It does not seem to be</i>
<i>a situation to be doubted</i>

288
00:43:22,816 --> 00:43:26,081
<i>But, a policeman's job is to doubt</i>

289
00:43:50,144 --> 00:43:52,044
Will our plans work out?

290
00:43:53,747 --> 00:43:55,009
Yes, it will

291
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,016
Concentrate on this, Sofi

292
00:45:11,592 --> 00:45:16,086
You have learnt it all
You can now practice at home

293
00:45:16,263 --> 00:45:17,753
You need not come here

294
00:45:25,506 --> 00:45:27,303
Oh, you are back... come in

295
00:45:31,211 --> 00:45:33,270
Do not be afraid, come here

296
00:45:37,518 --> 00:45:38,780
- Is your class over for today?
- Yes

297
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:41,783
How are the classes going on?
Is Harsha sir teaching you properly?

298
00:45:42,756 --> 00:45:45,657
We should encourage kids'
talents like this

299
00:45:45,759 --> 00:45:49,991
It will guide them to chose their
career paths in future

300
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:54,460
I want to meet Harsha but it is late now

301
00:45:55,302 --> 00:45:58,635
Can I get his mobile number to fix up
an appointment with him?

302
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:01,264
Harsha's mobile number has been
changing often these days

303
00:46:01,608 --> 00:46:06,170
So, he calls on the land line when he is
free to teach my daughter

304
00:46:08,148 --> 00:46:10,708
So, you do not know
his new mobile number...

305
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,566
Do you remember me?

306
00:47:06,874 --> 00:47:07,670
Alex sir, why are you here?

307
00:47:08,542 --> 00:47:16,176
I just dropped in while passing this way
I, often think of you...

308
00:47:52,185 --> 00:47:53,812
Roy, must have called you now, isn't it?

309
00:47:54,021 --> 00:47:55,955
No, he does not know my new number

310
00:47:56,056 --> 00:47:58,820
You, keep changing
your phone numbers often, isn't it

311
00:47:59,393 --> 00:48:00,792
Would you like to have
some tea or coffee?

312
00:48:00,894 --> 00:48:02,885
I, prefer tea to coffee

313
00:48:20,013 --> 00:48:23,107
You prefer to use
stainless steel, isn't it?

314
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,589
The house looks good but,
why do you need 3 bedrooms?

315
00:48:36,697 --> 00:48:39,530
I, use just 2 rooms
The 3rd one has been locked by the owner

316
00:48:40,434 --> 00:48:41,366
Why is it so?

317
00:48:41,635 --> 00:48:45,002
When taking a house on rent, one is
eligible to use all the rooms in it!

318
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:50,905
You can either break it open or
come again with a search warrant

319
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,036
We can get the keys from the owner
and open it together

320
00:48:53,146 --> 00:48:55,876
But, there is no case against you!

321
00:48:56,049 --> 00:48:57,880
So, take your hands off that door

322
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,017
Oh no...

323
00:49:01,655 --> 00:49:03,782
It is 5'o clock, I'll have tea later

324
00:49:21,074 --> 00:49:25,408
There can be bruises and scratches
The bruises get healed on its own

325
00:49:27,681 --> 00:49:31,913
But, the bruises that happen here,
should be erased by us, alone

326
00:52:48,815 --> 00:52:50,248
I will be there soon

327
00:52:58,325 --> 00:53:01,726
Have you heard of any incidents with
animals in this jungle before?

328
00:53:01,895 --> 00:53:04,363
- No, sir!
- Okay

329
00:53:10,337 --> 00:53:11,565
Sir is here

330
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:21,144
He was on his rounds when he saw
a hand, leg and a thigh

331
00:53:26,586 --> 00:53:28,713
They informed us immediately

332
00:53:29,923 --> 00:53:32,619
Our team has gone in search of
the remaining body parts

333
00:53:39,532 --> 00:53:41,966
These are remains left behind
by some animal

334
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,237
Do you see this cut here?

335
00:53:48,742 --> 00:53:52,178
There would have been teeth marks if
it was bitten by some animal

336
00:53:52,913 --> 00:53:55,746
Any chance for DNA results?

337
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,318
The skin has been decaying
for around 4 days now

338
00:53:59,419 --> 00:54:03,788
There is no hair, nails
or palm prints on this

339
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:06,950
The most peculiar thing is that,
there is not a drop of blood on this either

340
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,654
Someone has done this on purpose

341
00:54:09,963 --> 00:54:13,091
I want the report on this, on my table
as soon as possible

342
00:54:29,115 --> 00:54:30,139
Is this your piano?

343
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:35,017
He had rented if from somewhere
Those people will come for it 4 days time

344
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,114
When did he vacate the house?

345
00:54:39,225 --> 00:54:42,126
2... 4... 4 days now, sir

346
00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:45,354
Sir, I will not rent this house
to bachelors anymore

347
00:54:46,766 --> 00:54:49,894
It is a pain to get the rents from them
Advance is not a problem for me

348
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:55,736
I want someone with a good
social background like us

349
00:54:56,076 --> 00:54:58,237
Are you interested?

350
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:06,681
You haven't spoken anything...
Have you forgotten something here?

351
00:55:06,786 --> 00:55:08,913
Can you please shut up?

352
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,025
This bedroom was locked up, isn't it?

353
00:55:21,134 --> 00:55:24,262
This is not a bedroom
It is the door to the basement

354
00:55:25,638 --> 00:55:29,165
I had given the whole house on rent

355
00:55:34,447 --> 00:55:36,506
Stay here! I will be back soon...

356
00:59:08,328 --> 00:59:11,126
Sir, I enquired about the number
you had given me

357
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,858
There are no calls made
from that number

358
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:16,766
There is just one message that has
been sent which says, sunrise is too early

359
00:59:16,869 --> 00:59:19,064
The details of the person, who has sent...

360
00:59:19,172 --> 00:59:21,640
...and the person who has received
the message, are both fake

361
00:59:26,746 --> 00:59:29,510
Sir, based on the old records of Raghavan,
that we have, the DNA tests performed...

362
00:59:29,616 --> 00:59:32,983
...on the cigarette
bud have proven that, it is his

363
00:59:33,419 --> 00:59:37,321
But, we have no scope to compare it with
the body parts that have been found now

364
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:40,087
This is not Raghavan's!

365
00:59:42,061 --> 00:59:46,430
The body is Raghavan's and
this was done by Harsha

366
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:50,996
It is all ready...

367
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:10,046
Why hasn't he given the remaining parts
but, only the hand and leg?

368
01:00:15,228 --> 01:00:19,824
He wants us to feel like helpless
dummies, not knowing what to do

369
01:00:19,966 --> 01:00:21,558
That was his aim!

370
01:00:44,524 --> 01:00:48,585
Sir, just give me an opportunity
I will make him say it all

371
01:00:48,695 --> 01:00:50,788
Where is the proof?

372
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,661
We have no proof that it was Raghavan,
who was killed

373
01:00:53,766 --> 01:00:55,893
So, how can you prove that it was Harsha,
who has done this?

374
01:01:24,364 --> 01:01:27,231
We cannot do anything!

375
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:46,140
- Why are you here?
- I have vacated the hostel

376
01:02:46,646 --> 01:02:51,083
Neither am I going home, nor from here
till we decide something about this

377
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,651
Oh...

378
01:02:52,952 --> 01:02:58,982
How can you stay here?
This place is meant for bachelors

379
01:02:59,425 --> 01:03:03,885
What will I do, Roy?
My folks are forcing me to get married

380
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:07,255
They will get me married off
to some moron

381
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:12,262
I have been delaying it for so long
now I can't anymore

382
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:20,905
It is okay
I am there and I will find a way...

383
01:03:26,252 --> 01:03:28,345
Nimmi, this is nothing like
what you think it is

384
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:50,440
It sounds nice but doesn't
appeal a mass effect

385
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:58,745
The generation today prefers
something with extra effects

386
01:04:00,686 --> 01:04:03,712
I can re-do it the way you suggest

387
01:04:05,858 --> 01:04:09,055
I will just hum...

388
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:21,797
How is it?

389
01:04:21,908 --> 01:04:23,500
This has already come in
a Hindi movie before

390
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,975
That was so long back

391
01:04:26,078 --> 01:04:30,515
People will not remember it now
You, go ahead with the mix and we can rock

392
01:04:30,883 --> 01:04:34,444
I am doing a movie for the first time and
I do not intend to do it like that

393
01:04:34,554 --> 01:04:39,321
What do you know?
I know what people like

394
01:04:39,725 --> 01:04:42,626
To know what people like,
you should watch movies with them...

395
01:04:42,728 --> 01:04:44,753
...and not just keep
watching movies at home

396
01:04:45,264 --> 01:04:48,791
You are nothing as of now and how can
you teach me what to do?

397
01:04:48,901 --> 01:04:50,766
Get lost!

398
01:04:55,441 --> 01:04:56,874
<i>I should not have reacted!</i>

399
01:05:02,048 --> 01:05:03,811
Try it once more, if you have the guts to...

400
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:09,351
Coming to my office and testing my guts?!

401
01:05:10,756 --> 01:05:14,886
I can leave only after I pick all of this,
so u can get out!

402
01:05:45,424 --> 01:05:49,053
- Nimmi, why are you here?
- Get on... need to talk

403
01:05:49,962 --> 01:05:51,486
What is it?
Any problem?

404
01:05:51,831 --> 01:05:54,823
Not a problem...
He has to be taught a lesson

405
01:06:03,776 --> 01:06:04,765
Hey...

406
01:06:06,812 --> 01:06:09,406
You will never leave me at peace

407
01:06:09,782 --> 01:06:10,714
Be clear about what you are trying to say

408
01:06:10,816 --> 01:06:11,840
So, didn't you know about anything?

409
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:14,818
Someone is here with all her
bags and baggage

410
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,411
Shifted? Who is it?

411
01:06:18,924 --> 01:06:22,519
You are there with her, isn't it?

412
01:06:30,036 --> 01:06:31,765
You have come with your entire luggage

413
01:06:33,372 --> 01:06:36,773
Harsha, please come home
and talk to my folks

414
01:06:37,143 --> 01:06:39,873
It will be a big problem if I go there now

415
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:44,439
I have told you everything

416
01:06:48,688 --> 01:06:50,883
Please come and talk to my dad

417
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:54,018
Will he agree if I come and talk to him?

418
01:06:54,126 --> 01:06:55,889
We will make him understand

419
01:07:03,903 --> 01:07:05,063
Hey, will they come?

420
01:07:06,138 --> 01:07:07,264
They will not neglect it

421
01:07:08,307 --> 01:07:11,299
We are expecting some more people

422
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:13,275
I will place the orders as soon as
they are here

423
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:14,413
Okay, sir

424
01:07:17,049 --> 01:07:19,449
Keep this wallet
You can pay the bills

425
01:07:19,552 --> 01:07:21,144
Why can't you pay it?

426
01:07:21,721 --> 01:07:23,120
You don't have a job

427
01:07:23,222 --> 01:07:25,486
The least you can is, show them that
you have money

428
01:07:25,825 --> 01:07:30,091
If you had completed
your MBBS, you would...

429
01:07:30,196 --> 01:07:32,926
...have had a 'doctor' before your name

430
01:07:33,866 --> 01:07:35,697
I could not have followed my
passion then

431
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:39,597
Will your piano not sound if you have
the 'doctor' before your name?

432
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:42,501
Yes, it will not!
They have reached

433
01:07:48,214 --> 01:07:50,375
Dad, this is Harsha and Roy

434
01:07:57,389 --> 01:07:58,651
Half an hour

435
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,198
Uncle, you haven't spoken anything!

436
01:08:21,614 --> 01:08:23,206
2 minutes!

437
01:08:26,986 --> 01:08:31,082
We need some time to think about it
This is not a small issue

438
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,954
This has to be thought
and discussed about

439
01:08:34,059 --> 01:08:38,359
You have also asked for time
So, we will think about it too

440
01:08:44,804 --> 01:08:46,101
Okay, come on

441
01:08:50,409 --> 01:08:52,343
- The plan has flopped
- Shut up!

442
01:08:56,015 --> 01:08:58,506
- What are you doing?
- Making space for us to run away

443
01:09:01,654 --> 01:09:03,121
I've lost this too...

444
01:09:12,097 --> 01:09:13,724
Please serve us all some juice

445
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:15,164
What juice can I serve you, sir?

446
01:09:20,606 --> 01:09:23,268
'Pista', it is!
Would you like the pista shake?

447
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:28,611
We will have the 'pista'

448
01:09:43,329 --> 01:09:47,595
Harsha, why don't
you both just remain...

449
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,895
...friends rather than
complicating it like this?

450
01:09:50,002 --> 01:09:51,492
Who are you?

451
01:09:51,637 --> 01:09:55,300
I am Maya's uncle, Somashekhran

452
01:09:56,575 --> 01:09:58,372
I have spoken to him

453
01:09:58,477 --> 01:10:02,971
I came here to talk to him
and not to any other uncles

454
01:10:05,317 --> 01:10:10,311
Sir, this was really cheap of you
I spoke to you with all due respect

455
01:10:10,422 --> 01:10:12,515
But, you have not respected me

456
01:10:13,659 --> 01:10:17,425
Harsha, I was just testing you

457
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:23,325
These days, guys get married to girls
and ditch them later on

458
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:31,436
This was just a prank to judge the guy
who is supposed to marry my daughter

459
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:37,005
<i>I have heard this elsewhere!</i>

460
01:10:37,216 --> 01:10:40,549
I, do trust you
You can take your own time

461
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:43,747
So, can I take her home now?

462
01:10:45,557 --> 01:10:48,355
Of course, you can,
I am not marrying her now

463
01:11:16,422 --> 01:11:18,049
T. G. Ravi...

464
01:11:20,092 --> 01:11:24,586
The shooting has started already
I have a music director too

465
01:11:25,197 --> 01:11:26,858
We will try it for the next movie

466
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:28,522
Send me the tracks
that you have done already

467
01:11:28,634 --> 01:11:30,932
- Don't you have my e-mail id?
- Yes, sir

468
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,262
So, see you later

469
01:12:05,504 --> 01:12:07,096
The song sounds good

470
01:12:08,307 --> 01:12:11,105
The work on my new movie is going on now

471
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:16,307
So, call me for my next movie
I will see what can be done

472
01:12:23,622 --> 01:12:25,214
Menon sir, had asked me to come today

473
01:12:25,324 --> 01:12:27,918
It is still being planned
Nothing is sure, as of now

474
01:12:28,027 --> 01:12:30,222
- Please find out, sir
- He will like it

475
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:33,489
I have composed some music
for this new movie

476
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,794
How can you compose music
for a movie without a producer?

477
01:12:36,402 --> 01:12:38,768
Go, bring a producer
and we can decide then

478
01:12:38,871 --> 01:12:41,567
- Please, sir
- Please leave now

479
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:43,235
See you later

480
01:12:43,542 --> 01:12:44,509
Ismail...

481
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,077
Brother Ismail, have you
reached from Dubai?

482
01:12:46,178 --> 01:12:47,577
Please ask him, sir

483
01:12:53,385 --> 01:12:55,148
Why didn't you take your phone with you?

484
01:12:55,254 --> 01:12:56,186
I forgot

485
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:59,951
You have loads of missed calls
Take this...

486
01:13:03,662 --> 01:13:05,027
22 missed calls?

487
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:13,961
Harsha, they have locked me up here

488
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:18,169
Please come here soon
I will text you the address right away

489
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:45,864
- Where are you going at this hour?
- I will kill him today

490
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:49,299
We can all go together

491
01:13:49,408 --> 01:13:52,741
- All? Who all?
- There is someone

492
01:14:03,622 --> 01:14:08,321
I knew there is some trick to this
You didn't realize it

493
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:15,432
The older generation feels that
they know everything and we are all fools

494
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:19,762
They will do all the tricks
possible too

495
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:23,667
Haven't you seen the old movies of
T.G. Ravi?

496
01:14:24,109 --> 01:14:28,944
Nimmi, please be quiet
We are so tensed and you are...

497
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:30,681
What wrong did I say?

498
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:36,112
I had warned you that day
But, you both wanted to handle it alone

499
01:14:36,488 --> 01:14:40,117
What happened then?
You both don't know anything

500
01:14:41,426 --> 01:14:43,951
Only a girl can understand another girl

501
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:51,131
Please do not create a scene there
They must have planned a trap

502
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:54,797
Tell her we will be waiting outside

503
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:57,603
...and ask her to come out
without anyone's knowledge

504
01:15:07,519 --> 01:15:09,510
Maya, we are on our way

505
01:15:09,621 --> 01:15:13,990
We will wait in the car
Please come out

506
01:15:14,626 --> 01:15:19,427
I will not come out like that
I will walk out with you, in front of them

507
01:15:27,739 --> 01:15:29,866
Oh god, plan has flopped!

508
01:15:44,923 --> 01:15:47,016
How are you?

509
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,553
Anuty, it's me, Roy!

510
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:56,698
Can you call everybody?

511
01:16:08,914 --> 01:16:11,474
Don't be scared
I am there!

512
01:16:29,468 --> 01:16:34,201
Aunty, make us all some tea
Tea for you, uncle?

513
01:16:34,306 --> 01:16:36,331
No, my dear... coffee

514
01:16:36,775 --> 01:16:38,106
One coffee

515
01:16:41,246 --> 01:16:45,205
Uncle, what is it?
We had decided on some things

516
01:16:45,317 --> 01:16:47,512
Is it right to lock up Maya now?

517
01:16:56,528 --> 01:16:59,793
- Did they harm you?
- She is my daughter

518
01:16:59,931 --> 01:17:03,094
I will bring her up, hit her or kill her
Who are you to question me?

519
01:17:09,675 --> 01:17:13,634
I brought her up and educated her
with all love and affection

520
01:17:14,313 --> 01:17:16,873
Do you know what she told me?

521
01:17:21,653 --> 01:17:22,779
Where is it?

522
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,650
Where is the kerosene?

523
01:17:31,763 --> 01:17:33,560
Please listen to me

524
01:17:33,665 --> 01:17:36,031
She has done a mistake
We can talk to her

525
01:17:36,134 --> 01:17:41,572
I will decide it today
Let me die

526
01:17:44,876 --> 01:17:48,573
Where is the match-box?

527
01:17:51,216 --> 01:17:54,583
I am going to live with him
and not with the both of you

528
01:17:55,854 --> 01:17:57,412
Go, take your bath now

529
01:17:57,522 --> 01:17:59,353
Why do you get so influenced after
watching some movie?

530
01:18:27,586 --> 01:18:28,848
Please sit down

531
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:35,850
The time is 5:30 right now

532
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:39,957
I will go and file a complaint
at the police station

533
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:42,532
This is a village

534
01:18:42,868 --> 01:18:45,962
The cops will come and take away
the father and daughter

535
01:18:47,506 --> 01:18:53,240
I will take Maya from there
But you have 2 more daughters

536
01:18:54,045 --> 01:18:57,014
Do I have to remind you about that?

537
01:19:12,597 --> 01:19:13,757
Shall we go?

538
01:19:14,633 --> 01:19:16,260
Are you not sad at all?

539
01:19:16,368 --> 01:19:19,769
Why should I feel sad?
I am going to live with you...

540
01:19:23,475 --> 01:19:24,772
Give me the bag

541
01:19:25,076 --> 01:19:28,239
Go, get in soon before your father
changes his mind again

542
01:19:32,384 --> 01:19:34,545
Please come and call me from home

543
01:19:34,653 --> 01:19:37,281
Go, sit at home
I will come and call you

544
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:40,651
My folks will agree after seeing you

545
01:19:40,759 --> 01:19:42,249
That's it

546
01:20:14,659 --> 01:20:22,566
<i>Unseen by daylight unnoticed</i>
<i>by the dark pools of your eyes</i>

547
01:20:22,667 --> 01:20:30,164
<i>Unseen by daylight unnoticed</i>
<i>by the dark pools of your eyes</i>

548
01:20:30,275 --> 01:20:37,772
<i>Unperceived by your thoughts unknown</i>
<i>Curtained by showers of rain</i>

549
01:20:37,883 --> 01:20:44,846
<i>The rhythm of a song sung softly</i>
<i>within the heart full of melody</i>

550
01:20:44,956 --> 01:21:00,793
<i>Unknown... obscure</i>

551
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:05,940
I told you I'll find a job and go
Then why are you doing call center job?

552
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:12,948
But don't mess up at the last minute

553
01:21:13,251 --> 01:21:18,951
No problem, I'll quit this job
when you get through some break

554
01:21:48,086 --> 01:21:55,857
<i>Desires like stars twinkled and shimmered</i>
<i>Weaving together colors that never faded</i>

555
01:21:55,961 --> 01:22:03,663
<i>Like the breeze that sought a new way</i>
<i>sang a melting song in new language</i>

556
01:22:03,768 --> 01:22:11,140
<i>Unheard by the blossoming flowers</i>
<i>Invisible, they merged as dreams silently</i>

557
01:22:11,242 --> 01:22:18,273
<i>The rhythm of a song sung softly</i>
<i>within the heart, full of harmony</i>

558
01:22:18,383 --> 01:22:26,347
<i>Invisible and obscure</i>

559
01:22:51,082 --> 01:22:58,921
<i>Like a winged chariot racing along</i>
<i>In search of unseen and virgin shores</i>

560
01:22:59,024 --> 01:23:06,590
<i>In a drunken intoxication creeping unseen</i>
<i>Flying around in random, all over this earth</i>

561
01:23:06,698 --> 01:23:14,002
<i>Curtained by showers of rain</i>
<i>Unseen by your thoughts unknown</i>

562
01:23:14,105 --> 01:23:21,341
<i>The rhythm of a song sung softly</i>
<i>within the heart, full of melody</i>

563
01:23:21,446 --> 01:23:29,353
<i>Unseen and unheard</i>

564
01:23:30,522 --> 01:23:38,293
<i>Unseen by daylight unnoticed</i>
<i>by the dark pools of your eyes</i>

565
01:23:38,396 --> 01:23:46,360
<i>Unseen by daylight unnoticed</i>
<i>by the dark pools of your eyes</i>

566
01:24:00,819 --> 01:24:16,463
<i>Shrouded and out of sight</i>

567
01:24:27,979 --> 01:24:29,139
I'll be right back

568
01:24:36,588 --> 01:24:42,959
He cannot be blamed
I had behaved really nasty with him

569
01:24:43,128 --> 01:24:48,031
Everybody has some self-respect
That is what he too, has shown

570
01:24:49,734 --> 01:24:51,964
- Shall I move, dear?
- Okay

571
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:54,504
I had gone to get some milk
Have some tea before you leave

572
01:25:16,895 --> 01:25:20,797
We have nothing against anybody
Please do not be angry with us

573
01:25:29,774 --> 01:25:33,073
I know I was not right

574
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:37,474
I know you are taking good care
of my daughter

575
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:43,350
I was also wrong that day
Please forget all that

576
01:25:43,454 --> 01:25:45,217
You should come home too

577
01:25:45,323 --> 01:25:47,553
- Yes, uncle
- Shall I take leave

578
01:25:56,601 --> 01:25:58,967
So, you do know how to cry

579
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:00,230
Get lost!

580
01:26:10,548 --> 01:26:16,509
Please drive slow
I am in no hurry for any urgent work

581
01:26:16,621 --> 01:26:18,521
I know how to drive

582
01:26:18,623 --> 01:26:21,251
I need to finish this
and take the next customer

583
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:23,589
There will be other cars over there

584
01:26:23,695 --> 01:26:27,392
How can other cars do the trips
You may not be in need of money

585
01:26:27,498 --> 01:26:29,329
I get paid by the number of trips I do

586
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:31,595
Just shut up!

587
01:26:41,045 --> 01:26:43,138
- Hey, drive slower
- Oh, started off again!

588
01:26:43,248 --> 01:26:45,341
Can you just shut up
I have spoken to him over here

589
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:47,680
Hey, stop the car
Enough of your driving!

590
01:26:47,785 --> 01:26:50,618
I am not your mother's keep to stop
the car when you ask me to

591
01:27:00,064 --> 01:27:03,295
You may not value your life
but we value ours

592
01:27:05,069 --> 01:27:08,630
Don't create a scene here
Start the car

593
01:27:22,754 --> 01:27:23,914
Is he mad?

594
01:27:24,022 --> 01:27:26,650
- How can we go in his car, trusting him?
- Is this how people drive cars?

595
01:27:26,758 --> 01:27:30,319
What nonsense is this?
Is he trying to kill us?

596
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:34,329
How can he drive so carelessly?
There are 2 women too in the car

597
01:27:34,432 --> 01:27:36,457
Raghavan, come here!

598
01:27:40,438 --> 01:27:42,133
What is this?

599
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:44,674
Is this how you behave
with these employees?

600
01:27:44,776 --> 01:27:47,210
Sir, I did not misbehave with her

601
01:27:47,312 --> 01:27:50,406
I was driving fast and
madam has created a scene for that

602
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:53,143
Madam?
You were swearing at me before

603
01:27:53,384 --> 01:27:55,409
I can understand what you said

604
01:27:57,722 --> 01:27:59,553
I will be careful that incidents
like this never repeat again

605
01:27:59,657 --> 01:28:01,818
If you don't act against this...

606
01:28:01,926 --> 01:28:05,089
...I will complaint to the HR
against the both of you

607
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:08,359
Please do not betray me, madam
I will do the needful

608
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,105
That was a bit too much
You should not have hit him

609
01:28:24,215 --> 01:28:28,515
He was behaving too smart
He asked for it

610
01:28:53,911 --> 01:28:55,469
Can't you understand?

611
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:58,606
He has come again
and I will not get into that car

612
01:29:08,126 --> 01:29:11,027
Get down
Get down, I say!

613
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:14,629
Get down, I say!

614
01:29:14,799 --> 01:29:16,289
Who asked you to take the car?

615
01:29:16,401 --> 01:29:20,701
I will break your knees
if you take the car without my orders

616
01:29:20,805 --> 01:29:26,300
Supra, you have to drive
the car from today

617
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:27,604
- Okay
- Go

618
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:07,178
Harsha, how are you?
Hope you are doing fine

619
01:30:07,752 --> 01:30:08,514
Who is this?

620
01:30:08,619 --> 01:30:14,717
I am director, Arvind
Are you free to talk right now?

621
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:15,451
Yes, tell me

622
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:22,659
You had composed something then
Can you come and record it in Chennai?

623
01:30:22,767 --> 01:30:26,259
I am not interested
if it the way you want it to be

624
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:31,000
Forget that
Do it all your way

625
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:35,138
This is not the way
you had spoken that day

626
01:30:47,658 --> 01:30:49,216
This is the song from 'Dhoom'

627
01:30:50,461 --> 01:30:58,095
But, we have mixed it differently
I can say it is an inspiration

628
01:30:58,202 --> 01:31:02,104
You can say it is 'copied'

629
01:31:02,673 --> 01:31:08,043
These days, as soon as a movie is
released, people try to interfere...

630
01:31:08,479 --> 01:31:11,915
...and find out the source
and upload it on facebook

631
01:31:12,817 --> 01:31:15,183
Have you flicked the script also
from somewhere?

632
01:31:15,286 --> 01:31:16,184
No, not at all!

633
01:31:16,287 --> 01:31:17,117
Have you?

634
01:31:20,758 --> 01:31:24,922
I liked the song I had listened to then

635
01:31:25,229 --> 01:31:28,528
I am willing to proceed if it is that

636
01:31:39,177 --> 01:31:40,405
Sir, when do you want me to come over?

637
01:31:40,511 --> 01:31:43,605
Go meet Prasad, the production manager

638
01:31:43,714 --> 01:31:46,478
He will give you the flight ticket
and you can come over soon

639
01:32:06,737 --> 01:32:10,764
Maya, I will play something for you

640
01:32:11,175 --> 01:32:13,336
I don't want to listen to
whatever it may be

641
01:32:13,444 --> 01:32:15,776
- I want to sleep
- Okay, sleep!

642
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:25,722
Yes, it is something great
But, you can sleep now

643
01:33:08,132 --> 01:33:11,226
Roy, I am going to Chennai for
the recording of my first movie

644
01:33:11,335 --> 01:33:14,236
Hey, congrats! Where are you now?

645
01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:15,236
I am on the way

646
01:33:15,339 --> 01:33:17,864
So, you will not be around
for my sister's wedding!

647
01:33:18,142 --> 01:33:20,702
I will be stuck there

648
01:33:20,811 --> 01:33:23,279
Maya doesn't have a day off either
Or else, she would have come

649
01:33:24,315 --> 01:33:26,875
It is okay
Let your work happen

650
01:33:27,418 --> 01:33:28,646
Take care of Maya

651
01:33:28,753 --> 01:33:31,415
We will be around
Don't worry

652
01:33:48,372 --> 01:33:52,672
<i>The subscriber you are calling is</i>
<i>outside coverage area</i>

653
01:34:24,008 --> 01:34:24,736
Why are you here?

654
01:34:24,842 --> 01:34:26,639
I have not come here on purpose

655
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:30,475
Supran's route has been diverted and
he is the one who has sent me here

656
01:34:30,781 --> 01:34:33,409
You can ask him yourself

657
01:34:35,786 --> 01:34:38,755
Supran, I'm handing over
the phone to madam

658
01:34:42,259 --> 01:34:45,592
My route has been diverted
So, please adjust for today

659
01:34:46,230 --> 01:34:47,959
There is no security in this

660
01:34:48,065 --> 01:34:50,898
I will be in trouble
if this is reported to the office

661
01:34:51,001 --> 01:34:55,734
There is no empty cab here
That is why I have sent Raghavan

662
01:35:07,284 --> 01:35:09,752
I am sorry for the mistake that day

663
01:35:48,859 --> 01:35:50,554
Why have you stopped the car here?

664
01:35:52,430 --> 01:35:54,364
Are you not taking me to the office?

665
01:35:55,566 --> 01:35:57,466
You will complaint, isn't it?

666
01:37:00,998 --> 01:37:05,765
Harsha...

667
01:38:09,767 --> 01:38:11,632
It is excellent!

668
01:38:12,336 --> 01:38:13,963
- Did I not tell you?
- What did you tell me?

669
01:38:14,638 --> 01:38:16,731
- I told you
- When?

670
01:38:16,874 --> 01:38:18,865
Now...

671
01:38:22,846 --> 01:38:30,810
Someone has to initiate
and then people take over, isn't it?

672
01:38:30,921 --> 01:38:31,649
Yes

673
01:38:32,957 --> 01:38:35,551
Boney... a protein shake...

674
01:39:02,453 --> 01:39:06,583
I am in Chennai now and I will pay the bill
as soon as I reach there tomorrow

675
01:39:16,834 --> 01:39:17,698
Yes, tell me...

676
01:39:17,801 --> 01:39:20,861
I am not able to reach Maya
Her phone seems to be switched off

677
01:39:20,971 --> 01:39:24,134
I had tried calling her the other day
She did not answer my call

678
01:39:24,608 --> 01:39:26,542
I guessed she was busy with her work

679
01:39:26,644 --> 01:39:29,306
- Please, go and have a look
- Don't worry, I will go and check out

680
01:39:29,413 --> 01:39:31,040
I will board the train this evening

681
01:39:52,703 --> 01:39:55,228
- Who are you?
- I am Dr. Roy

682
01:39:55,339 --> 01:39:56,704
Do you live here?

683
01:39:56,807 --> 01:39:59,708
No... this is my friend's house
I have come to see his wife

684
01:39:59,810 --> 01:40:03,906
- Is her name, Maya?
- Yes... what is it?

685
01:40:04,014 --> 01:40:05,914
You have to come to the station

686
01:40:11,789 --> 01:40:14,053
- What is it?
- Please come here immediately

687
01:40:14,324 --> 01:40:16,656
I told you that I will be boarding
the train this evening

688
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:17,249
What is it?

689
01:40:17,361 --> 01:40:20,728
This is urgent
Please take a flight

690
01:40:20,831 --> 01:40:23,095
I will book the ticket
and send you the number

691
01:40:24,768 --> 01:40:27,202
- Come soon
- Tell me what it is

692
01:40:27,337 --> 01:40:29,669
I will tell you
once you have reached here

693
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,809
Which floor is Dr. Roy Philip on?

694
01:41:52,156 --> 01:41:53,783
Brother...

695
01:41:58,362 --> 01:42:02,492
What is it, Ammu?
Where is your sister, Maya?

696
01:42:05,702 --> 01:42:08,000
What is it?
What happened to Maya?

697
01:42:08,105 --> 01:42:09,231
Come here

698
01:42:18,549 --> 01:42:21,484
This is inspector, Alexander
Sit down...

699
01:42:33,797 --> 01:42:38,496
Harsha... please be bold and listen to
what I am going to tell you

700
01:43:54,811 --> 01:43:56,904
- Sir, there is a problem here
- What is it?

701
01:43:57,981 --> 01:43:59,915
- The corpse does not have a head
- No head?

702
01:44:01,218 --> 01:44:02,617
You should have told me
that on the phone

703
01:44:02,886 --> 01:44:05,753
You should make it look presentable
and then inform me

704
01:44:05,856 --> 01:44:07,448
Are the rest of us, not human beings?

705
01:44:07,724 --> 01:44:08,986
It is not enough if you only
look like human beings

706
01:44:09,092 --> 01:44:10,923
Who is the witness?

707
01:44:12,996 --> 01:44:14,793
He saw the body first

708
01:44:15,565 --> 01:44:19,023
Tell him all what you had told me

709
01:44:20,237 --> 01:44:25,140
He looks half dead already
Don't scare him further

710
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,375
We got this from the corpse

711
01:44:34,351 --> 01:44:36,979
We are usually informed on days
he can't come

712
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:39,246
I do not know what happened that day

713
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:42,484
I assumed that the supervisor would
have been informed

714
01:44:42,693 --> 01:44:45,958
I, sent the cab only because I was not
informed that he was on leave that day

715
01:44:47,230 --> 01:44:51,291
Show me the register for the route chart

716
01:44:57,474 --> 01:44:58,964
Here it is, sir

717
01:45:01,778 --> 01:45:04,440
Who was the driver who went
on that route that day?

718
01:45:04,548 --> 01:45:06,539
We had gone and waited there

719
01:45:07,184 --> 01:45:09,744
But, madam did not come
So, we got back

720
01:45:09,853 --> 01:45:10,581
Didn't you try calling her?

721
01:45:10,687 --> 01:45:15,351
No, she did not answer the call
We, waited for 5 minutes and got back

722
01:45:18,795 --> 01:45:24,199
But, Maya's colleagues told us that you
did not go on that route that day

723
01:45:26,269 --> 01:45:29,705
Tell us what happened on that day

724
01:45:30,307 --> 01:45:33,174
I don't know, sir

725
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:35,275
Ramachandran...

726
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:39,706
Come on, Supran

727
01:45:48,458 --> 01:45:50,722
Please don't hit me, sir
I will tell you everything

728
01:45:50,827 --> 01:45:53,660
I did not go to pick up
madam Maya that day

729
01:45:54,197 --> 01:45:55,630
What was the reason?

730
01:45:57,367 --> 01:45:58,732
Tell me!

731
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:07,806
Raghavan told me that he will go
and pick her up that day

732
01:46:07,911 --> 01:46:09,003
What was that for?

733
01:46:09,112 --> 01:46:17,520
He forced me, telling me that they had
a fight which he wanted to resolve

734
01:46:20,223 --> 01:46:24,523
Did you see Raghavan
after this incident?

735
01:46:26,696 --> 01:46:28,527
Does he have work today?

736
01:46:29,366 --> 01:46:32,096
Sir, that is Raghavan

737
01:47:49,279 --> 01:47:53,841
Ramachandran... enough

738
01:48:08,732 --> 01:48:12,532
- Harsha...
- I want to see her

739
01:48:44,267 --> 01:48:48,226
This is not her, Roy

740
01:49:38,588 --> 01:49:43,855
Harsha... open the door

741
01:51:52,555 --> 01:51:55,991
I will lose myself if you too
break down like this

742
01:52:22,685 --> 01:52:25,153
Give me the microphone
Can you hear me?

743
01:52:28,925 --> 01:52:31,826
Here is the judgement for the murder case
of Maya that had created big news

744
01:52:31,928 --> 01:52:35,022
Based on the reports the accused Raghavan...

745
01:52:35,131 --> 01:52:37,031
...has been sentenced to life imprisonment

746
01:52:37,133 --> 01:52:38,657
Is this all what he get for
what we went through?

747
01:52:38,768 --> 01:52:41,999
That 'son of a bitch' should be hanged

748
01:52:42,105 --> 01:52:44,869
Roy, stop getting agitated like this

749
01:52:45,141 --> 01:52:48,633
I have fought this like
no other case in my career

750
01:52:48,845 --> 01:52:50,938
As per the Indian law,
for a person to be hanged...

751
01:52:51,047 --> 01:52:53,982
...the case has to be the rarest of its kind

752
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:57,242
The court does not feel this, a rare case

753
01:52:57,587 --> 01:52:59,282
If you are not satisfied...

754
01:52:59,389 --> 01:53:02,415
...please go, be the judge yourself
and sentence him to be hanged

755
01:53:02,525 --> 01:53:05,585
Even if you judge him to be hanged,
it will not happen

756
01:53:05,695 --> 01:53:07,822
In democratic India...

757
01:53:07,931 --> 01:53:11,025
...the actual judgement has been brought in,
for very few cases

758
01:53:11,134 --> 01:53:14,900
If it was not like this, our country
would have progressed way ahead by now

759
01:53:15,038 --> 01:53:17,836
When a judgement is made,
some jobless Rogues...

760
01:53:17,941 --> 01:53:22,241
...and human rights organizations
come up with ideas against it

761
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:50,262
<i>In the crimson sea of sorrow</i>
<i>burning and blistering is the sun</i>

762
01:53:52,976 --> 01:53:57,345
<i>Blood red</i>

763
01:54:02,318 --> 01:54:14,287
<i>The deep, deep blue sea filled</i>
<i>with burning coals that rise stormily</i>

764
01:54:21,204 --> 01:54:27,302
<i>As storm waters catch fire</i>

765
01:54:27,410 --> 01:54:30,436
<i>Fire... fire</i>

766
01:54:30,547 --> 01:54:36,713
<i>As I sculpt a figurine</i>
<i>out of flames of fire</i>

767
01:54:36,819 --> 01:54:42,655
<i>Using this life birth as my mould</i>

768
01:54:49,232 --> 01:55:00,541
<i>With revenge shall it be crucified</i>
<i>In anger with a nail all rusted and old</i>

769
01:55:07,984 --> 01:55:19,885
<i>As seven days</i>
<i>seven nights hasten</i>

770
01:55:23,466 --> 01:55:33,239
<i>In the middle of the night slowly</i>
<i>darkness creeps in all its glory</i>

771
01:56:00,703 --> 01:56:10,874
<i>Wearing a crown of skulls</i>
<i>of moonlight as an ornament</i>

772
01:56:13,383 --> 01:56:17,877
<i>Adorned with the ashes of the burning pyre</i>

773
01:56:19,722 --> 01:56:25,854
<i>Dancing the thunderous dance of revenge</i>

774
01:56:25,962 --> 01:56:30,592
<i>As garlands of intestines</i>
<i>worn by tongues of fire</i>

775
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:37,071
<i>A thirst to drink</i>
<i>in the depths of the sea</i>

776
01:56:39,509 --> 01:56:54,220
<i>A thirst to swallow volcanoes</i>
<i>Thirst... so thirsty</i>

777
01:57:09,072 --> 01:57:11,267
Sir, what do you feel
about this judgement?

778
01:57:23,753 --> 01:57:27,553
What do you expect me to say?

779
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:40,669
Have you filed a case against that guy?

780
01:57:40,770 --> 01:57:45,070
What should I file a case for?

781
01:57:45,374 --> 01:57:51,540
For trying to attack someone
who brutally killed his wife?

782
01:57:53,182 --> 01:57:54,945
Would we accept it
and leave him alone...

783
01:57:55,051 --> 01:57:57,986
...if someone had done this
to someone dear to us?

784
01:57:58,855 --> 01:58:03,349
The maximum punishment any crime gets
here is, life imprisonment

785
01:58:03,559 --> 01:58:06,255
That gets reduced to a parole...

786
01:58:06,362 --> 01:58:07,954
...and then further lenient to the extent of
being set free later on

787
01:58:08,064 --> 01:58:10,225
He will again, start to do all what
he has done before

788
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:13,959
The Arab rule should be applied here

789
01:58:14,070 --> 01:58:17,836
The accused should be killed with
the same brutality in front of the public

790
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:19,373
That is when they will learn a lesson

791
01:58:21,110 --> 01:58:24,011
The Indian rules are full of loopholes

792
01:58:24,447 --> 01:58:27,109
It is lenient enough for people
to escape eventually

793
01:58:27,950 --> 01:58:31,909
Once it is dark, these uncouth men do not
allow women to walk around safely

794
01:58:32,355 --> 01:58:35,017
It is called 'god's own country'
What nonsense!

795
01:58:35,324 --> 01:58:38,122
These rotten rules have to be re-written

796
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:43,855
I was here to tell you
not to charge any case against him

797
01:58:43,966 --> 01:58:45,593
Set him free

798
01:59:12,862 --> 01:59:15,660
I do not know how to console you

799
01:59:18,534 --> 01:59:21,628
Nothing is in our control

800
01:59:23,706 --> 01:59:26,573
He has been sentenced
to life imprisonment

801
01:59:26,843 --> 01:59:31,405
We can't be too sure of that

802
01:59:33,549 --> 01:59:35,312
Take care and pray for Maya

803
01:59:36,352 --> 01:59:38,081
That is all we can do

804
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:47,427
There is no case filed in Harsha's name
You can take him

805
02:00:18,227 --> 02:00:22,493
Bruises and scratches happen
Bruises get healed on its own

806
02:00:24,033 --> 02:00:29,061
But, bruises that happen here, should
be taken away by us

807
02:01:18,421 --> 02:01:20,548
'Cave of Grace'

808
02:01:21,290 --> 02:01:25,317
Welcome to this programme

809
02:01:25,428 --> 02:01:29,694
We will be shocked to hear of the number
of crimes that are happening around us

810
02:01:29,799 --> 02:01:32,529
We are not sure of the number of people
who are getting punished...

811
02:01:32,635 --> 02:01:33,761
...and the number of them who escape

812
02:01:33,869 --> 02:01:37,828
The ones who escape get back to
repeating the crimes again

813
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:44,502
Nobody enquires about the ones
in jail and their families

814
02:01:44,613 --> 02:01:46,843
We only get know
what is written in the papers

815
02:01:47,249 --> 02:01:54,678
We, through this programme aim at
bringing out such things to light

816
02:01:54,790 --> 02:01:58,521
Today, we are going to meet
the family of Raghavan...

817
02:01:58,627 --> 02:02:04,031
...who was involved in the much
talked about murder case of Maya

818
02:02:05,468 --> 02:02:07,197
Ever since Raghavan has gone to jail...

819
02:02:07,303 --> 02:02:13,708
...his one-legged wife, Myna has been
trying hard to make ends meet

820
02:02:13,876 --> 02:02:19,178
She has been working in other houses to
meet the medical and home expenses...

821
02:02:19,281 --> 02:02:27,052
...that have to be met for her
and her mother-in-law

822
02:02:35,164 --> 02:02:37,894
People say my husband is a murderer

823
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:40,864
We do not know what has
actually happened

824
02:02:42,705 --> 02:02:46,232
We have no idea whether he has
done some mistake

825
02:02:47,009 --> 02:02:48,943
We have nobody to help us

826
02:02:49,078 --> 02:02:52,536
I have to take care of this mother
who is sick

827
02:02:53,416 --> 02:03:00,549
We are not able to believe that,
Raghavan has done something so brutal

828
02:03:01,590 --> 02:03:04,650
He is a gentleman inside
the jail premises

829
02:03:04,860 --> 02:03:07,886
He shows no traits of being a criminal

830
02:03:08,130 --> 02:03:12,897
It is surprising how a person like him
could do a crime like this

831
02:03:19,075 --> 02:03:19,632
What are you searching for?

832
02:03:19,742 --> 02:03:20,902
Where is the remote control
for the television?

833
02:03:21,710 --> 02:03:22,904
Here it is

834
02:03:25,548 --> 02:03:30,247
After 4 years, Raghavan has
come out due to Deyaharji's help

835
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:36,952
Myna is happy that her prayers have
finally been answered

836
02:03:37,059 --> 02:03:39,994
When he has repented
and is starting a new life...

837
02:03:40,096 --> 02:03:43,361
...his neighbors are there
with him in full support

838
02:03:43,466 --> 02:03:46,629
President for the youth wing, Mr. Babu...

839
02:03:46,735 --> 02:03:50,364
They have suffered a lot
after Raghavan had gone to jail

840
02:03:50,539 --> 02:03:53,406
We know how Myna has worked with one leg

841
02:03:53,509 --> 02:03:57,946
Today, he has come out because of my efforts

842
02:04:02,151 --> 02:04:05,018
Life in the jail has made me a good man

843
02:04:05,287 --> 02:04:07,778
My neighbors in this colony,
who have understood me...

844
02:04:07,890 --> 02:04:09,858
...have pooled in money
to buy me this auto-rickshaw

845
02:04:10,126 --> 02:04:13,425
Hereafter, I will live for my family

846
02:04:27,576 --> 02:04:31,342
He has to be killed

847
02:04:32,848 --> 02:04:35,681
He has to be killed
But, we should not get caught

848
02:04:54,937 --> 02:05:00,569
<i>A new dawn born all bright</i>
<i>The night swallowed within its darkness</i>

849
02:05:00,743 --> 02:05:06,579
<i>In search of a color</i>
<i>to draw patterns from</i>

850
02:05:06,682 --> 02:05:11,847
...<i>my innermost being unravels</i>
<i>strange twirls of spirals</i>

851
02:05:16,091 --> 02:05:17,581
- Dude?
- I am on my way

852
02:05:17,693 --> 02:05:19,923
- Dude, don't get into trouble
- Okay!

853
02:05:33,909 --> 02:05:39,870
<i>On pathways where shadows</i>
<i>danced in abandon</i>

854
02:05:39,982 --> 02:05:45,682
<i>Climbing up steps</i>
<i>whom do you follow?</i>

855
02:05:45,788 --> 02:05:51,283
<i>And thus today as numerous</i>
<i>strange twirls of spirals unravel</i>

856
02:05:56,732 --> 02:05:58,700
- He turned right
- Okay

857
02:05:59,935 --> 02:06:00,765
Go!

858
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:17,110
<i>To witness in hiding,</i>
<i>to change to fade away</i>

859
02:06:17,219 --> 02:06:23,124
<i>To search endlessly</i>
<i>to gain to possess</i>

860
02:06:23,225 --> 02:06:26,661
<i>At this moment will it melt</i>
<i>unto me, bestow on me</i>

861
02:06:26,762 --> 02:06:33,725
<i>And thus today as many</i>
<i>strange twirls of spirals unravel</i>

862
02:06:47,516 --> 02:06:50,144
<i>A new dawn born all bright</i>

863
02:06:50,386 --> 02:06:53,082
<i>The night swallowed within its darkness</i>

864
02:06:53,322 --> 02:06:59,227
<i>In search of a color</i>
<i>to draw patterns from</i>

865
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:08,293
...<i>my innermost being unravels</i>
<i>strange twirls of spirals</i>

866
02:07:39,668 --> 02:07:41,636
- Are you not going to Delhi?
- No, I am not

867
02:07:43,772 --> 02:07:46,900
- What is the reason?
- We need to plan it

868
02:07:49,978 --> 02:07:52,708
You have to reach me home and then
to the airport as soon as possible

869
02:07:52,815 --> 02:07:56,581
There is a rugged road which is a bit long
but we can reach sooner

870
02:07:56,685 --> 02:07:57,777
Okay

871
02:09:24,039 --> 02:09:28,669
Madam, wait

872
02:09:28,811 --> 02:09:31,871
Listen to me
Don't run

873
02:11:39,274 --> 02:11:44,974
Police have recovered parts of
a human body from a forest near Chalakudy

874
02:11:45,147 --> 02:11:52,644
Forensic studies have shown
that it is several days old

875
02:11:53,188 --> 02:11:55,418
Police squad led by inspector Alexander...

876
02:11:55,524 --> 02:12:00,393
...have been questioning the forest guards
and others around the area

877
02:12:00,495 --> 02:12:02,986
The police have not been able to identify...

878
02:12:03,098 --> 02:12:11,301
...whom the burned body parts of someone
who was brutally killed, belongs to

879
02:12:11,406 --> 02:12:15,399
Hence, the investigation further
continues with suspicions

880
02:12:16,845 --> 02:12:19,973
Sir, what do we do now?

881
02:12:21,683 --> 02:12:23,344
It is not Jesus Christ
who has been killed, isn't it

882
02:12:23,452 --> 02:12:26,216
It is Judas
Let him die

883
02:12:26,922 --> 02:12:29,083
There are many more like him,
who have to die

884
02:13:33,722 --> 02:13:39,957
<i>As these tongues of flames catch on</i>
<i>and spread all over earth and heaven</i>

885
02:13:40,062 --> 02:13:46,160
<i>As it blazes through the forests</i>
<i>and the seven seas</i>

886
02:13:46,268 --> 02:13:59,306
<i>Far, far away in search, reaching out</i>
<i>Without abating or dying away</i>

887
02:14:13,095 --> 02:14:16,587
- Sir, coffee or tea
- I prefer tea to coffee

888
02:14:17,032 --> 02:14:19,933
It's not enough to watch the DVD at home
To know the pulse of the masses

889
02:14:20,035 --> 02:14:21,866
You have to at times
Sit and watch a movie along with them

890
02:15:02,677 --> 02:15:08,775
<i>Unseen and unnoticed by anyone</i>
<i>Searching in vain forever</i>

891
02:15:08,884 --> 02:15:15,050
<i>Not fading away nor deigning to rain</i>
<i>Appearing along the corner of the eye</i>

892
02:15:15,190 --> 02:15:28,297
<i>Far, far away in search, reaching out</i>
<i>Without abating or dying away</i>
