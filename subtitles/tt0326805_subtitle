00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,260
Delhi

4
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,638
You must have guessed that already

5
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,891
They say the festival of Diwali here
is very beautiful

6
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:44,104
"And why not? The crowds,
the lamps in the shops..."

7
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,524
"fire crackers, sweets,
colorful decorations..."

8
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,402
and bright lights everywhere

9
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:54,781
But I only work in this city.
I stay with a friend...

10
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:59,077
in a small flat of ours.
He's at home right now

11
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:03,623
"Because of him, I have ventured
out in the cold weather"

12
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,918
I thought I'd buy a few gifts
and surprise him

13
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,797
It would make him very happy.
He hardly speaks...

14
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:15,719
"but had he not been with me, I'd have
had to spend this Diwali too all alone"

15
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:27,981
Let's light the lamps!

16
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,186
You know what my uncle says?

17
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,605
"He says, if you can go to sleep,
looking at the stars..."

18
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:14,277
all your dreams come true

19
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,885
Khushi?
- Aunt!

20
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,222
Where are you folks?
I miss you so much and you...

21
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,974
"It's the wedding season, my dear"

22
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:48,269
You know how busy I get

23
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,106
But where are you calling from?
And when are we meeting?

24
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:55,193
"There's an engagement ceremony
at Mr. Bansal's, this evening"

25
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,529
Is Meghna getting married?

26
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:01,449
"See? We sang when she was born,
and even today"

27
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,910
She'll be very happy to see you

28
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,955
"Just you see, Aunt.
It's Meghna's wedding"

29
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,125
"I'll have you eased out,
if that's the last thing I do"

30
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,585
I'll sing the song she
and I used to always sing

31
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,296
I'll make you bite the dust!

32
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:19,592
But how am I going to get any leave?
I've used up all the excuses!

33
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:25,682
So Khushi has a dearth of
excuses to make it?

34
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,811
Watch it... hurry up

35
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,527
"Khushi?
- Yes, sir"

36
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,238
What happened?
Are you down with a cold?

37
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,407
"No, sir. I'm crying"

38
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,284
Crying? What for?

39
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:51,166
"My aunt's dog Tommy has met
with an accident, sir"

40
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,294
But you said you were an orphan

41
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:58,506
So where did this aunt
and her dog spring from?

42
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:02,302
"Now that I need Tommy so desperately,
you're asking me this question?"

43
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,139
Which means you're going
to bunk work again tomorrow?

44
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,310
"Please try to understand, sir.
- I understand everything!"

45
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:16,900
I need to make you understand!
Don't do such things!

46
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:43,343
"Quietly, stealthily,
he will arrive..."

47
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,263
and he'll whisk you away

48
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,820
"This is what our lives
are all about..."

49
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,823
"there's this much
to our dream"

50
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:09,160
"A dream you have, I have,
everyone of us has..."

51
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:15,041
"may your dream never be shattered,
may your lover never be angry with you"

52
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:40,775
"This is a relationship
that transcends many births..."

53
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:45,655
a marriage is all about destiny

54
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:03,631
"May you always be fortunate,
may your lover never be angry with you"

55
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:08,928
"Quietly, stealthily,
he will arrive..."

56
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,516
and he'll whisk you away

57
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,918
Didn't I send them all packing?

58
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,338
"First tell me where you stay,
what you do for a living, what..."

59
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,882
"Uncle, I'm absolutely all right"

60
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,052
I have a job and a small place
to live in

61
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,305
Are you living all alone
in such a big city?

62
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,558
"Aunt, take a chill pill! Haven't
I lived with you for 15 years?"

63
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,814
"So instead of mummy, daddy,
brothers, sisters..."

64
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:06,403
"I have found aunt, uncle,
Bindiya, Poltu...!"

65
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,367
I want to live all alone and
see life for what it is

66
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,286
"And believe me,
it's great fun"

67
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:19,082
All alone?
- Oh yes

68
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:23,044
"But your eyes said something else
a little while ago, my child"

69
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,714
"No psychology, Uncle!"

70
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:29,467
"You will see. Very soon,
a prince will come along..."

71
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:34,556
and he'll take you away
on a white horse

72
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:39,060
"You are giving everyone
so much of love, my child"

73
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,441
That love will one day shower on you.
It has to

74
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,912
"Where are you taking me, Ranvir?"

75
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,624
A surprise is meant
to be a surprise

76
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,170
What's gotten into you suddenly?
I never saw you behaving like this

77
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,506
Right from our childhood...

78
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:12,177
I had to move heaven and earth
to make you say something

79
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:16,473
"And now, you're...
- I decided to take a gamble today"

80
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:20,143
Of letting life itself
decide my life

81
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,482
You ought to have been a poet.
How did you become an architect?

82
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,444
You hardly have your feet on the
ground... how will you make buildings?

83
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:34,407
"On a foundation of truth, the
buildings will come up on their own"

84
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,260
What's that?

85
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,555
Our engagement gift.
- What?

86
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,184
"Make a wish, and I promise,
I'll fulfill it before our wedding"

87
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,813
What's wrong with you today?
Have you gone mad?

88
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:08,108
"What had to happen to the two of us,
happened a long time ago"

89
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,070
This is only the outcome

90
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,407
"You and I...?
You're kidding, aren't you?"

91
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,453
"If this is a joke, our life
of 15 years is a joke too"

92
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:27,585
You should have at least asked me!
- What? I thought...

93
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:32,799
"What did you think? Forget me, you
haven't even figured out yourself"

94
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,385
Where did you get the money
for the land?

95
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:41,349
Where will you get the money
to build the house?

96
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:46,688
There's a big difference between
your dreams and my goal

97
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,651
I've known you all my life. Your feet
have hardly ever been on the ground!

98
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,780
How can I entrust all I have to a man
who lives in a world of dreams?

99
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:15,759
Shall we go?

100
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,529
Wow! This is fantastic!

101
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:41,284
That girl turns you down
and you act like a jilted lover!

102
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,331
You're hasty with
everything in life!

103
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,375
You've hardly found a job...

104
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,211
and you go and buy a land
and start building a house!

105
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:55,674
I had to work for 22 years before
I could build this house!

106
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,261
You can barely count properly
and you think...

107
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,514
"What is it?
- Come on, I'll make him see reason"

108
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,766
Make him see sense!

109
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,103
Do something for a living!

110
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:14,234
Worthless fellow!

111
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,124
"No, my son... no"

112
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:32,293
You shouldn't lose heart

113
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:38,341
I know how difficult it is
for you to speak your heart

114
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:44,931
But you needn't worry. In your life
will come another girl...

115
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,518
"and she'll bring happiness
to all of us, okay?"

116
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,909
"Ranvir, it's been a week
since you returned from Shimla"

117
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,038
Don't always wear a long face.
Come on...

118
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:14,794
it's such a big party. The boss
would like to see cheerful faces

119
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,402
I'm very happy today!
The lab we have designed...

120
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:45,116
is the first one to get ready!

121
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:51,122
All I will say is that the faith I had
in the youngsters of our company...

122
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:56,294
has been strengthened
even more today!

123
00:13:56,294 --> 00:14:00,173
"The only other thing I will say is,
since I've been in the army..."

124
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,973
I'm sick and bored
with lectures

125
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:33,206
"The second course hasn't arrived yet.
- On its way, sir! It's ready!"

126
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,836
"Nisha, you were the one who
checked the stocks last time?"

127
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:42,340
"Yes, sir.
- When Khushi wasn't here!"

128
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:48,430
You are going to check
the stocks tonight!

129
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,725
Everyone has already eaten
and you're still...

130
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:58,148
"even if you're not hungry, you could
have had some for the boss's eye"

131
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:06,531
"Great speech, sir"

132
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:24,049
C'mon!

133
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:46,321
"Sorry, the bar's closed"

134
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:52,535
One drink you surely can...?
- I'm really sorry

135
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,710
"Terrible disease, mister.
Liquor can't cure it"

136
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:11,388
How much is 17 and 11?

137
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:17,227
What?
- 17 and 11?

138
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:26,861
Whose picture were you making?
Mine?

139
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:30,490
Of a dream.
- I dream a lot too

140
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:36,371
Let me see your dream

141
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,336
"For the highest peak in Shimla,
I have a dream"

142
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,508
The one I was making it for...

143
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,678
"found the dream and the truth,
both wanting"

144
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:57,058
"Excuse me, mister"

145
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:01,104
The bar is really closed and I've
got to go home. Shall we leave?

146
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,964
You were delayed because of me.
May I drop you home?

147
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,634
No thank you.
My house is close by

148
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:37,640
May I walk you home then?

149
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:51,112
Are you a Delhiite?

150
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,869
What did you ask?

151
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:01,039
Are you a local?

152
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,751
"I have no fixed place.
Here today, there tomorrow"

153
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,631
"The whole world belongs to me,
all its people belong to me"

154
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:15,220
"Well, mister...
what are you getting at?"

155
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:24,104
You're making a mistake.
I don't want anything

156
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,817
I'm only trying to forget someone

157
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,945
Out with your wallet.
- What?

158
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:37,450
Out with it

159
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:45,834
Her? You're trying to forget her?
You're holding her to your heart

160
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:52,799
"But...
- It shows on your face, mister"

161
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,884
Khushi! Khushi...

162
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,845
Aunt!

163
00:18:56,845 --> 00:19:02,517
She's bringing the food!

164
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,856
The food is here!

165
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:12,569
I've brought to much today.
Here it is... more!

166
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:18,033
Who's he?

167
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:21,327
A rotten guy.
I wonder what he thinks of himself

168
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:27,500
I'll go and get rid of him

169
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:34,007
"So, mister... this is how far
we could walk together"

170
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:09,292
Sir! What are you doing?

171
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:15,340
It's wrecked!

172
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:22,347
"Sir, what's gotten into you?
Are you all right?"

173
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,851
"What's wrong with you, sir?
- I'm all right..."

174
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,104
and I'm here to give you
some good news

175
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,981
What news?
- You lose your job...

176
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,652
"and this flat from today!
- No, sir!"

177
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:42,033
"How will I manage, sir?
Where will I go? Please sir"

178
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:49,749
Go where you want to!
Go to hell!

179
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:56,297
You've bunked work for 16 days!
New excuses always

180
00:20:56,756 --> 00:21:01,553
"Your uncle is ill, your dog
is ill... get out!"

181
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:25,869
Uncle! Aunt!
What are you up to?

182
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:31,666
What are you doing...?
It's my stuff!

183
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,670
What happened?

184
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,341
We were happy selling the stuff

185
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:44,054
"What happened, dear?"

186
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:48,892
That rotten friend of mine has thrown
me out of the job and the house

187
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:52,354
Threw you out?

188
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:55,899
"Had my guest-room been ready,
I'd have shifted you there"

189
00:21:56,858 --> 00:22:00,320
Whether it's your Delhi
or my Bombay...

190
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:04,491
these architects are all very lazy.
- They're no good

191
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:15,418
It's Mumbai!

192
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,170
What are you laughing for?

193
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:04,467
"Aunt, my problem is solved"

194
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:10,682
I've found a place to stay in
and also my goal

195
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:51,408
"Jonathan, the owner of this house
is not only rotten, he's also broke"

196
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:58,248
See the state of this house?
It's so filthy

197
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:02,335
"If I touch this money, I'll have
to return to Delhi on foot"

198
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,504
Let me keep it

199
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:08,591
"Know what? You look after my stuff,
I'll go and make some arrangements"

200
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,179
"I follow a rule, my child"

201
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,891
"If someone does not pay me on time,
it makes me very angry. Very angry"

202
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,854
"Take your neighbor, Mrs. Sharma,
for instance"

203
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:24,691
I've told her so often to
settle my dues every Monday

204
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:28,028
But she won't.
And Mrs. Narula...

205
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:32,532
you take your provisions from here too.
But you've never been late

206
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:36,870
So I'll note down your dues
in the accounts book

207
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,915
Mrs. Narula: Rupees 950

208
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:48,506
Here are your provisions.
That will be 1950 rupees

209
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:51,801
Thank you. Write it down
in my account

210
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:55,847
Excuse me... but I do
not recognize you

211
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:59,726
"Well, I'm Ranvir's..."

212
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:02,937
"you know Ranvir, don't you?
- Ranvir Malhotra?"

213
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:07,233
Ranvir! This is an eye-opener!

214
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,236
"Congratulations, dear
Hearty congratulations!"

215
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:14,366
He's one in a million!
Go on. Take the stuff

216
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:18,495
I'll recover every penny from Ranvir.
Go on!

217
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:33,468
I'm Puja

218
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:37,305
Ranvir and I...

219
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:42,018
"Puja! Yes, Ranvir showed me
your picture in his wallet!"

220
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:48,108
I don't understand this.
Ranvir never told me about you

221
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:54,197
I heard you telling the
store-owner that you're...

222
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:58,201
but how did Ranvir suddenly
decide to get married?

223
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:01,538
I don't understand.
- You're making a mistake

224
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:08,169
The marriage hasn't actually
taken place yet. We're engaged

225
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:10,505
"Since I had some holidays,
I thought I'd visit Shimla"

226
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:13,383
To check out the house. Who knows?
I might not have liked it at all

227
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:16,928
"And Ranvir?
- Everyone likes Ranvir, right?"

228
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:22,308
That's not what I meant.
- I know

229
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:25,311
He's busy with his work.
He'll be here in a few days

230
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:28,106
But...
- Forget all that and tell me...

231
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:31,234
which is the best restaurant in town?
- Why?

232
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,653
Because you're taking me
to dinner there tomorrow

233
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:39,909
You're Ranvir's friend and
I have no friend here

234
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:43,329
"Tomorrow, I...
- At one tomorrow. This place, okay?"

235
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:51,796
"Sorry, Ranvir. Looks like
I've spoken a bit too much"

236
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:55,508
"But I couldn't help it.
I had to arrange a meal for myself..."

237
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:59,137
"and also get on with the farce.
But you needn't worry..."

238
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:05,310
"if I don't make a hero out of you,
I'd be fibbing about myself"

239
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:41,221
My son... my son...

240
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:45,558
get up and take a look.
There's someone down there

241
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,769
"Sir, your mother's calling you"

242
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,854
My son...

243
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:53,566
"I heard you! Tell her,
I'm all of 62..."

244
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:56,111
I'm not a little kid anymore!
My son! My son!

245
00:28:56,111 --> 00:29:01,574
My son...
- Coming!

246
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:20,218
Hello

247
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:22,262
Hello

248
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:26,349
"Amazing sofa you have. I went
to sleep, the moment I lay down"

249
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:30,603
"Oh yes, you have nice tastes"

250
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:33,440
How much is it worth?
- 8000

251
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,527
Write it down in my account.
Mrs. Ranvir Malhotra

252
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:47,245
What happened?
- If you...

253
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:51,499
are Mrs. Ranvir Malhotra...

254
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:57,672
this sofa and we...
everything here belongs to you

255
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:03,970
Why? Is that such
an impressive name?

256
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,432
It's the name and the relations!
- Really?

257
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:10,268
And my son's choice
is impressive too

258
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:14,397
Hey family!
- Family?

259
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:18,068
Ranvir is my son

260
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:21,946
"Family, meet my son's wife"

261
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:26,868
Isn't my son's choice impressive?
- Very impressive!

262
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:32,207
You have got to know all of us

263
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:35,502
Now tell us... when are you
becoming Mrs. Malhotra?

264
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:40,256
"Don't mind, sister-in-law...
how did it all happen so quickly?"

265
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:44,761
"I mean, my brother left
just a few days ago"

266
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,889
Well... what will I say to you?

267
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:53,061
You can ask him

268
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:56,147
You said you have a job in Delhi

269
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:59,651
"So your parents must also
be from Delhi, isn't it?"

270
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:02,153
Are you going to ask her
every detail right away?

271
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:06,116
She's going to live here anyway.
You can ask her later

272
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:09,703
"Come, dear. Let me take you
to your room"

273
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:16,459
"Well, actually, it's that house..."

274
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:20,296
Ranvir told me

275
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:23,466
I know Ranvir's angry with me

276
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:27,178
"I shoot off my tongue some times...
right, family?"

277
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:31,641
Some times?

278
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:34,561
I don't know when Ranvir
and I are going to make up

279
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:38,148
But it'll make me very happy
if you live in this house

280
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:46,448
"She has come to start a family
of her own. Am I right, dear?"

281
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:51,536
And that's a very big thing
for a bride

282
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:55,373
"You may live there, dear.
Both the houses belong to us anyway"

283
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,711
You can come to meet us
any time you wish to

284
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:04,257
She has brought happiness to our
family... lots of happiness

285
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:09,429
All the differences
will be sorted out

286
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:23,860
The boss will be
very happy to see it

287
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,863
The boss wants to see the
lay-out of the factories

288
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:29,407
Not dreams of beautiful homes

289
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:34,287
What you are seeing
is just a dream

290
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:40,335
"Come on, buddy...
forget her"

291
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:44,172
This cursed house is the root
of all trouble

292
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:48,051
"Till this house exists,
I'll hope to settle in it..."

293
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,181
I'll keep waiting for Puja.
I'd rather sell this house

294
00:32:55,141 --> 00:33:01,898
Take a day off tomorrow.
Sell this house and come back

295
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:42,480
"Sorry, my child.
We've come a bit too early"

296
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:46,609
"No, it's just that I slept
so well after a long time"

297
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:51,489
That's because you were
sleeping in your own house

298
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:54,701
Since today is your
first day here...

299
00:33:54,701 --> 00:34:00,331
we've brought you a present

300
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:14,804
My first ever bangles

301
00:34:15,388 --> 00:34:18,725
Mine too

302
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:24,981
May the new house and a new life
be lucky for you

303
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:32,947
"You know? After ages, a son of this
family is going to get married"

304
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:38,453
Everyone is so happy!
They're all waiting outside

305
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:41,915
Just freshen up
and come out

306
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:07,065
"Nice folks, aren't they?"

307
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:10,443
They could very well teach
someone a lesson or two in love

308
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,408
What if all this wasn't a dream?
What if it were all true?

309
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:21,204
You know what would have happened?
My dream would have come true

310
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:28,586
I too would have been married
in a loving family like this one

311
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:31,965
"Anyway, I don't have the time
for all this"

312
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:35,301
I've got to go out for lunch
and you...

313
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:40,432
you can stay with the rotten furniture
for these wonderful people. Okay?

314
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:46,312
Where was I...?
Oh yes

315
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:49,816
Initially I thought Ranvir was
like any other boy

316
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:54,279
"All sound, no fury.
But you know something?"

317
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:59,367
I saw a hint of sincerity
in his eyes

318
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:04,622
When he came to drop me home
after our first meeting...

319
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:13,840
"there in Delhi, we were tied in a bond
I could not understand"

320
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:20,972
That night...
the food has arrived!

321
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:30,857
"So what was I saying? In a few days,
Ranvir got a promotion"

322
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:35,612
That's exactly how
I reacted too!

323
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:39,074
A double-promotion!

324
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:42,994
He once came in a suit to take
me out... he looked so handsome

325
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,667
He took me out to dinner.
And the champagne...

326
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:53,713
"you understand champagne,
I hope?"

327
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:58,593
Afterwards...

328
00:36:58,593 --> 00:37:02,597
"What happened?
I mean, what happened then?"

329
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:06,810
That which happens to girls like us
only in our dreams

330
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:10,438
"In public, he went down
on his knees and said..."

331
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:15,694
"Khushi, every grief that
is heading your way..."

332
00:37:16,194 --> 00:37:22,033
"I will take for myself. And all
the happiness I am destined for..."

333
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:26,454
"I wish to give to you.
I want to lay it out for you"

334
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:33,378
"Marry me, Khushi"

335
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,880
How could I have refused him?

336
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:38,925
"After all, any girl in my shoes..."

337
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:43,346
Hey! You haven't eaten anything!
- I'm not hungry

338
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:50,645
May I eat it?

339
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:22,635
I feel so shy...

340
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:30,894
"I feel so shy,
how will I tell everyone..."

341
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:37,484
about my exploits in love

342
00:38:38,568 --> 00:38:41,696
My beloved...

343
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:44,032
the wicked one...

344
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:50,747
has three traits

345
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,935
Will you tell me
what's happening here?

346
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:14,145
Could you come in first...?
- Don't drive me...

347
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:18,608
What are you doing in my house?

348
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:22,404
I know you're going to be
very angry

349
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:25,949
But I had no other way

350
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:30,662
"After I met you that night,
my boss came into my room..."

351
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:35,291
he had had a lot to drink.
He tried to force himself on me

352
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:42,173
And I... I ran away from there.
But I had lost my job and my house

353
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:46,761
I think I've told you.
I'm all alone in the world

354
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:52,600
I was looking for support when
I saw the sketch you had prepared

355
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:59,899
It smiled at me and I thought...
- You need brains to think

356
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:02,819
Pick up your stuff enact
this drama elsewhere. Go on!

357
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:05,447
"Please have mercy
on this poor girl, sir"

358
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:08,700
Whatever has happened to you
is in the past

359
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:14,998
Pick up your belongings and
get going. Get going!

360
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,137
This diwan...
- Your mother...

361
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:33,433
how could I refuse her?
- My mother?

362
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:36,936
"This is from your grandmother,
this is from your uncle..."

363
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,108
and this from your brother...
- All this stuff...?

364
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:49,074
It's a wedding present

365
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:52,494
You are undoubtedly
talking about our wedding

366
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:55,789
You have such a dilapidated house...
- It's okay... Go on

367
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:01,711
What could I say?

368
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:06,132
So what did you say?
- That we are going to get married

369
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:08,885
So you could escape
with all this stuff?

370
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:11,721
What else have you got
your hands on? Speak!

371
00:41:11,721 --> 00:41:15,058
Your mother's bangles...
I've got to return that too

372
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:27,654
What did you tell Puja?
What did you say to her?

373
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:33,118
She bought me lunch!

374
00:41:48,508 --> 00:41:51,720
I saw your jeep

375
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,807
When did you arrive?
- Just now

376
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:57,851
"Lovely weather, isn't it?"

377
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:01,021
Why don't you sit outside?
I'll fetch some tea

378
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:04,315
I'll be back soon

379
00:42:04,315 --> 00:42:09,320
Shall we?

380
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:26,671
"I didn't want you to...
- Now look, about Khushi, you..."

381
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:30,550
"How would I know,
if she hadn't told me?"

382
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:36,097
That you...
- What?

383
00:42:36,097 --> 00:42:40,643
That you're so romantic?
The way you won her heart...

384
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:45,482
any girl could have
gone crazy about you

385
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:52,572
I've asked her everything.
About each of your meetings...

386
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:56,618
"about every trait of yours,
every success..."

387
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:12,342
"That it would all happen so quickly,
I never really imagined"

388
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:21,393
Why didn't I?

389
00:43:21,393 --> 00:43:24,896
I didn't imagine it either.
Maybe...

390
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:31,820
everything happened on its own

391
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:35,949
And maybe this is good
for everyone too. Isn't it?

392
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:48,378
"All your dreams are
coming true, isn't it?"

393
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:56,344
Congratulations.
I must leave now

394
00:43:56,344 --> 00:44:00,390
Won't you have some tea?

395
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:05,895
Some other time

396
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:19,576
Let that be. She has left

397
00:44:19,868 --> 00:44:22,328
Because of me...

398
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:26,332
I'll leave by this evening.
- Maybe because of you...

399
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:30,378
Puja has realized that she has
made a mistake

400
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:33,798
What are you trying to say?
- Just that...

401
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:42,807
"you can stay on,
if you wish to"

402
00:44:42,807 --> 00:44:46,895
And then?
- You need a house. And I need you

403
00:44:47,854 --> 00:44:51,149
Go on

404
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:55,278
"You're lucky, your drama
has worked"

405
00:44:56,446 --> 00:45:01,618
"Or else, your story ought to have
driven Puja even farther away from me"

406
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:06,456
But what happened is just
the opposite

407
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:11,670
Maybe this is how the mind
of a woman works

408
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:15,340
Let's talk sense.
- Sense says it...

409
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,385
that we'll play this game
for a few more days

410
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:22,430
You can stay here and I'll spend a
few more days in my father's house

411
00:45:24,432 --> 00:45:26,935
You've made plans for
the rest of your life!

412
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:30,480
What if something goes wrong?

413
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,899
Nothing will happen

414
00:45:32,899 --> 00:45:36,111
"Maybe not with you,
what happens to me?"

415
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:40,365
Free board and lodge...
what else do you want?

416
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:43,618
That's a nice way of
asking for a favor

417
00:45:46,746 --> 00:45:51,751
Now look...

418
00:45:56,923 --> 00:46:00,135
As if saying sorry will deal
a blow to your manhood

419
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:04,889
"Forget it, mister. I've stopped
expecting decency from men like you"

420
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:09,436
Let's talk business

421
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:13,606
What do you want?
- 2000 rupees a week

422
00:46:13,606 --> 00:46:16,943
2000?

423
00:46:16,943 --> 00:46:22,115
Listen... sit down

424
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:24,117
All right

425
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:29,956
And...
- And...?

426
00:46:30,707 --> 00:46:36,588
I told you.
I can't return a gift

427
00:46:45,972 --> 00:46:48,892
You have brought the bride home
for the first time

428
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:51,186
Officially introduce her
to everyone now

429
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:54,606
"You've already met her, haven't you?
- But we must have an introduction"

430
00:46:57,442 --> 00:47:01,780
My Uncle
- Hello

431
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:06,701
God bless

432
00:47:07,952 --> 00:47:12,123
Grandma.
- Grandma!

433
00:47:12,123 --> 00:47:14,459
Nazakat Ali.
- Greetings

434
00:47:14,459 --> 00:47:16,586
Gurtej.
- Sat Sri Akal

435
00:47:16,586 --> 00:47:22,676
My father.
- Father!

436
00:47:25,303 --> 00:47:27,555
We've cooked your
favorite food today

437
00:47:27,555 --> 00:47:30,850
Khushi told me that you like
mashed eggplant very much

438
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:33,103
You never told me

439
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:37,774
"She... likes it, you see.
That's why"

440
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:40,402
Kitchen department... move it!
- One minute

441
00:47:40,402 --> 00:47:44,155
How will it be if the young lady
lights the oven for once?

442
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:48,660
Yes! Let's go

443
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:53,790
"Father, join us... come on!"

444
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,918
Wait here

445
00:47:56,918 --> 00:48:00,213
"What's all this, son?
How did it happen?"

446
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:04,384
Well...

447
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:08,013
I'm myself surprised.
I didn't even realize when...

448
00:48:09,723 --> 00:48:14,894
I hope you are doing all this
with due thought?

449
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:21,151
Don't do it

450
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:24,738
What?
- I mean...

451
00:48:25,196 --> 00:48:31,327
stop thinking so much.
Do what your heart asks you to

452
00:48:34,247 --> 00:48:37,917
"My son, will you
take an advise?"

453
00:48:37,917 --> 00:48:44,382
Happiness comes without announcing
its arrival. On its own

454
00:48:45,091 --> 00:48:50,513
"And when it arrives, there is
joy everywhere around"

455
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:57,562
Forget about the past

456
00:48:57,562 --> 00:49:02,692
Forget it. And accept
this happiness

457
00:49:02,692 --> 00:49:07,906
"You will listen to me, won't you?"

458
00:49:07,906 --> 00:49:13,370
This is the living room and...

459
00:49:14,162 --> 00:49:16,706
Will you have some breakfast?

460
00:49:16,706 --> 00:49:19,042
Mother has sent some
milk and jalebis

461
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:20,752
"No, you go ahead"

462
00:49:20,794 --> 00:49:26,716
I'll show Puja the bedroom.
C'mon

463
00:49:26,716 --> 00:49:32,806
"Jalebi? Have some,
mother has sent it"

464
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:44,442
I wanted us to begin every day
of our life with a lot of love

465
00:49:44,442 --> 00:49:47,570
So I've designed the bedroom
in such a way...

466
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:54,327
that the Sun will awaken us
every morning with affection

467
00:49:57,872 --> 00:50:02,210
So you've shown her
what your dreams are?

468
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:05,714
Terrible habit he has. He shows
everyone his dreams

469
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:12,470
"After all, some things are
very personal, aren't they?"

470
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:19,019
"Anyway, I should be at the hotel now"

471
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:52,719
You love her very much?

472
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:56,431
Since when?

473
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:58,725
I don't know

474
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:03,438
Ever since I remember...
I haven't even thought of another girl

475
00:51:05,273 --> 00:51:08,902
She's a very lucky girl;
this is what every girl wants

476
00:51:10,111 --> 00:51:14,199
What?

477
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:17,827
That the one she loves must not even
be able to think of anyone else

478
00:51:21,623 --> 00:51:27,879
What will you do if
you don't have her?

479
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:33,968
Maybe I'll never be able to fall
in love with another girl again

480
00:51:38,264 --> 00:51:41,893
You'll surely find your goal.
I have a strong feeling

481
00:51:42,852 --> 00:51:45,021
You know why I'm called Khushi?
(khushi=happiness)

482
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:51,152
Because I'm destined to give
everyone I meet a lot of happiness

483
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:55,532
I'll give much more joy
than I myself receive

484
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:59,494
"Just you see, now that I am here,
everything will change for the better"

485
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:14,509
Ranvir... you?

486
00:52:14,509 --> 00:52:19,973
I was passing by and...

487
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:22,225
I came over to meet you

488
00:52:22,267 --> 00:52:27,897
You look worried

489
00:52:28,314 --> 00:52:33,945
I don't know what's right
and what's wrong

490
00:52:33,945 --> 00:52:38,742
Khushi thinks I still have a
soft corner for you...

491
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:43,580
and maybe...

492
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:55,425
"Puja, I...
- Wow, Ranvir! I knew it!"

493
00:52:58,094 --> 00:53:00,096
I knew you'd surely come here!

494
00:53:00,096 --> 00:53:04,225
"Didn't I tell you, Puja?
He'd surely come!"

495
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,355
You are making a mistake.
I only wished to talk...

496
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:13,693
I was here to talk too!
But my way was different

497
00:53:14,944 --> 00:53:21,493
I came here hoping that my suspicion
about Puja would vanish today

498
00:53:22,577 --> 00:53:27,082
But what's for real
and what is a misunderstanding...

499
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:31,002
"is all here before me today!
- Now look, Khushi..."

500
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:36,966
"Let it be, Ranvir. At least don't poke
fun at me in everyone's presence!"

501
00:53:49,688 --> 00:53:53,108
"Hey lady! Had you not sprung at
Puja's place, I had had it made today"

502
00:53:53,566 --> 00:53:57,404
Really? It's my arrival on the scene
that has set the ball rolling

503
00:53:58,863 --> 00:54:02,242
You're a duffer.
- What do you mean?

504
00:54:02,242 --> 00:54:06,913
You don't understand girls.
The real fun begins now

505
00:54:06,913 --> 00:54:10,208
Spread the trap in such a way
that even if the bird escapes...

506
00:54:10,709 --> 00:54:14,713
it must be forced to return to you.
All that takes time

507
00:54:16,172 --> 00:54:18,883
"It has to do with
delicate threads, mister"

508
00:54:18,883 --> 00:54:23,054
Use force and the thread will snap.
Make her feel jealous...

509
00:54:23,471 --> 00:54:27,934
torment her some more. Understand?
- Somewhat

510
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:31,312
Will you buy me an ice-cream?
- Why?

511
00:54:31,312 --> 00:54:35,650
It's fun to eat an ice-cream
in winter. Let's go!

512
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:41,114
"Two orange candies, please"

513
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:56,713
Shut up and let's go

514
00:55:02,802 --> 00:55:07,682
Let's go!

515
00:55:09,476 --> 00:55:12,562
However much the times have changed...

516
00:55:12,562 --> 00:55:15,398
for how long will the boy
and the girl meet like this?

517
00:55:15,398 --> 00:55:18,485
We'll have to start talking
about your marriage

518
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:22,572
"We'll have to meet your parents
at least once, my child"

519
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:26,201
"They're both so busy, father.
Papa's busy with his business..."

520
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:29,496
and my Mother's busy with
her kitty parties and social work

521
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:34,751
They have left the decision to me.
- But if we could meet them once...

522
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:39,381
"Father, let it be"

523
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:42,425
Khushi's parents can't get along
with each other

524
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:45,637
"Although she won't say that,
I know the truth"

525
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:48,390
They can't stay together
in a single room

526
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:54,771
So we'll invite them when
our wedding date is fixed

527
00:55:55,021 --> 00:56:00,110
"Father, Ranvir is right.
I..."

528
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:09,661
Moron! You have made her cry!

529
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:17,961
Why did you have to say such
things about my parents?

530
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:24,676
What will they think about me
and my parents?

531
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:28,805
I wasn't talking about your parents.
Have you forgotten?

532
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:32,142
"Mummy's busy with kitty parties,
daddy's caught up with business"

533
00:56:32,684 --> 00:56:37,272
They're the ones
I was talking about

534
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:41,276
Still! I had made an impression.
And you've ruined all that!

535
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:44,863
You can't stop lying and you
start believing in your lies

536
00:56:44,863 --> 00:56:48,324
That's your biggest problem.
- What do you mean?

537
00:56:48,324 --> 00:56:53,371
Use your yarn sparingly.
Your lies could land us in trouble

538
00:56:53,872 --> 00:56:59,085
"And I'll really have to marry you.
Let's go, I'll buy you an ice-cream"

539
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:04,007
Liar!

540
00:57:11,514 --> 00:57:14,059
Hey liar!
- What is it?

541
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:19,981
Let's go. It's time
for the drama

542
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:42,671
Do you still come here
when you want to think?

543
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:45,965
It's been a habit for years.
How can I give it up so easily?

544
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:55,225
I've been thinking
about you and me

545
00:57:58,144 --> 00:58:04,401
About our days at the college.
Remember?

546
00:58:07,946 --> 00:58:13,952
"The other day, in my house..."

547
00:58:16,246 --> 00:58:20,375
What mistake did you make?
It was between Khushi and me

548
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:26,381
"But the fight took place
because of me, isn't it?"

549
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:30,802
I know. And that is why
I am embarrassed

550
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:36,349
"I wanted to say something to you.
But Khushi was there, and so..."

551
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:42,480
Khushi acts like a kid.
- You're no less a kid either

552
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:47,110
What a big fight over
something so trivial

553
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:49,863
What does that mean?
- I mean...

554
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:54,451
"when one is angry,
you must placate her"

555
00:58:54,451 --> 00:58:58,455
"When one acts childish, you must
give her a chance to make up"

556
00:59:04,753 --> 00:59:08,340
"You know, Puja? You don't know
what a nice girl you are"

557
00:59:10,508 --> 00:59:17,432
"All you need is someone who will
love you, take care of you..."

558
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:23,188
who can appreciate what he
has gained in having you

559
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:26,524
Just as I feel about Khushi

560
00:59:29,235 --> 00:59:31,321
I must leave now. Coming?

561
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:35,200
I'd like to be here
for some more time

562
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,787
Don't think too much.
It isn't good for your health

563
01:00:29,462 --> 01:00:34,300
"You are right before me,
I'm right before you..."

564
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:39,973
"I am right before you,
you are right before me..."

565
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:45,687
"And yet, we are
distanced by miles"

566
01:00:46,187 --> 01:00:51,151
"Your heart is pounding
and my bangles tinkle"

567
01:00:51,609 --> 01:00:56,740
"Oh God... how love
ties us down"

568
01:00:57,407 --> 01:01:02,495
"Oh God... how love
ties us down"

569
01:01:52,837 --> 01:01:57,842
"I think of yielding,
my heart stops me..."

570
01:01:58,301 --> 01:02:02,472
"my heart thinks of acquiescing,
I think of holding firm"

571
01:02:04,265 --> 01:02:09,145
"Through long nights, our love-talk
is still not complete..."

572
01:02:09,604 --> 01:02:14,401
"if you were to acquiesce,
we would complete what's unfinished"

573
01:02:14,901 --> 01:02:20,073
"Oh God... how love
ties us down"

574
01:02:26,329 --> 01:02:31,543
"You are right before me,
I'm right before you..."

575
01:03:21,718 --> 01:03:27,098
"Go and help yourself
to the flowers..."

576
01:03:27,682 --> 01:03:30,060
"live, if you wish to..."

577
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:33,021
"or perish, if you must"

578
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:38,109
"How I wish your heart
would give in today..."

579
01:03:38,526 --> 01:03:43,323
and I'd be a slave to you

580
01:03:44,407 --> 01:03:48,995
"Oh God... how love
ties us down"

581
01:04:26,241 --> 01:04:29,411
Mother...
- Yes?

582
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:31,788
May I say something?

583
01:04:31,788 --> 01:04:35,792
Certainly. Why must you ask?

584
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:39,629
"Every time I speak, everyone
in the family is angry with me"

585
01:04:41,923 --> 01:04:45,135
I won't be angry. Go on and tell me.
What is it?

586
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:50,390
I can't understand...
- What?

587
01:04:51,182 --> 01:04:55,353
This thing between Khushi and Ranvir
isn't moving ahead

588
01:04:55,353 --> 01:05:01,109
It has either to do with Puja...
or with Khushi's parents

589
01:05:01,693 --> 01:05:04,154
There's a jam. It isn't
leading up to a wedding

590
01:05:04,154 --> 01:05:10,201
"I can't understand this.
- But I do understand, my son"

591
01:05:10,785 --> 01:05:15,457
Really? How come?

592
01:05:15,457 --> 01:05:19,085
It's just that you are very naive

593
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:25,216
You are not going to understand
this drama of love

594
01:05:25,675 --> 01:05:29,262
"But I do.
- That's all right, but..."

595
01:05:31,848 --> 01:05:36,353
This game of love...

596
01:05:36,353 --> 01:05:41,107
needs a gifted writer.
Nothing else

597
01:05:43,401 --> 01:05:47,947
Biji! Are you talking
about a romantic writer...!

598
01:05:48,323 --> 01:05:50,950
"No, no!"

599
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:54,746
Just keep watching.
Your Biji understands everything

600
01:05:55,121 --> 01:06:00,835
She'll set everything right

601
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:13,932
Check... and mate

602
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:17,143
See that? He has copied my move!

603
01:06:20,355 --> 01:06:24,275
That's enough. There's something...

604
01:06:24,275 --> 01:06:29,698
"Let me say something, Biji"

605
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:32,701
"Come here, my child.
- Coming, Biji"

606
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:35,704
I don't wish to play with cheats

607
01:06:35,704 --> 01:06:38,915
"Sit down.
- What is it, Biji?"

608
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:45,213
"This evening, I have invited
someone home"

609
01:06:46,172 --> 01:06:53,346
"Someone with a lot of jewellery,
a lot of bangles and saris"

610
01:06:56,725 --> 01:07:01,438
"For the bride in the family.
For you, my child"

611
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:07,318
"Me?
- Yes, my child. For you"

612
01:07:17,245 --> 01:07:23,209
"Mother, do send my father..."

613
01:07:23,835 --> 01:07:27,422
Spring is here...

614
01:07:45,523 --> 01:07:51,237
"My child, your father
is separated from us"

615
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:55,909
Although Spring is here

616
01:08:32,737 --> 01:08:36,908
Lovely jewellery.
Keep it with care

617
01:08:36,908 --> 01:08:39,911
Keep it with you for the time being

618
01:08:39,911 --> 01:08:43,331
So you trust a thief?
- Can't help it

619
01:08:43,998 --> 01:08:48,795
It's a matter of time. Play with
the jewellery for some more days

620
01:08:54,551 --> 01:08:57,887
"Where are you guys, Rajiv?
We've got to start work. Hurry up"

621
01:09:01,016 --> 01:09:04,811
I'm all ready!
What's to be done?

622
01:09:04,811 --> 01:09:10,108
You see that lake?

623
01:09:10,108 --> 01:09:15,572
Fetch water from there

624
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,359
I've got good news for you.
- What?

625
01:11:16,359 --> 01:11:18,653
We've matched your birth-chart
with Ranvir's

626
01:11:18,653 --> 01:11:21,281
The two of you are destined
to have all the happiness!

627
01:11:21,281 --> 01:11:22,157
Really?
- Oh yes

628
01:11:22,157 --> 01:11:25,201
And the priest says the wedding
must take place at the earliest

629
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:28,204
But...
- Ranvir's ready too. Come on

630
01:11:28,204 --> 01:11:34,836
Where to?
- To apply henna on your palms. C'mon!

631
01:12:05,742 --> 01:12:08,161
"No, no, no..."

632
01:12:08,161 --> 01:12:10,747
No way

633
01:12:10,747 --> 01:12:15,543
"Do not apply
the henna on my palms..."

634
01:12:16,086 --> 01:12:20,215
"I am not going
to my beloved's house"

635
01:12:21,174 --> 01:12:25,428
Whatever my crazy heart says...

636
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:30,642
"I'm not falling
for his sweet talk"

637
01:13:42,505 --> 01:13:48,970
"In my veil, I pine..."

638
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:53,516
my scarf clings to me

639
01:13:53,516 --> 01:13:56,311
"I can't go to sleep,
I'm always awake..."

640
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:58,730
"if only I could hide somewhere,
go away someplace..."

641
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:01,900
"I wonder where this
unknown path will take me"

642
01:14:02,275 --> 01:14:06,446
Whatever my crazy heart says...

643
01:14:06,863 --> 01:14:11,451
"I'm not falling
for his sweet talk"

644
01:14:11,951 --> 01:14:14,037
"No, no, no..."

645
01:14:14,037 --> 01:14:16,915
No way

646
01:14:16,915 --> 01:14:21,795
"Do not apply
the henna on my palms..."

647
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:26,758
"I am not going
to my beloved's house"

648
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:15,348
I wield the magic wand...

649
01:15:15,765 --> 01:15:20,353
I'm a delicate doll...

650
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:23,064
"before I get angry,
and break..."

651
01:15:23,064 --> 01:15:26,067
"come with me, my friends,
I do not wish to go alone..."

652
01:15:26,067 --> 01:15:30,280
"I will tell my beloved
not to get closer"

653
01:15:30,697 --> 01:15:35,076
Whatever my crazy heart says...

654
01:15:35,493 --> 01:15:40,123
"I'm not falling
for his sweet talk"

655
01:15:40,707 --> 01:15:42,792
"No, no, no..."

656
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:45,587
No way

657
01:15:45,587 --> 01:15:50,342
"Do not apply
the henna on my palms..."

658
01:15:50,842 --> 01:15:55,388
"I am not going
to my beloved's house"

659
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:33,718
Hey fraud...

660
01:16:34,803 --> 01:16:41,017
Why did you sleep here?
You could've caught a cold

661
01:16:41,393 --> 01:16:45,689
Have you ever worn a sherwani?
- No. Why?

662
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:50,735
You'll look good in it.
Very good

663
01:16:50,735 --> 01:16:56,991
Were you dreaming?

664
01:17:16,886 --> 01:17:22,392
"Come, let's go upstairs"

665
01:17:23,143 --> 01:17:27,147
Will you have some coffee?

666
01:17:27,147 --> 01:17:32,193
On one condition

667
01:17:32,193 --> 01:17:35,655
What condition?

668
01:17:35,655 --> 01:17:38,700
You will serve the coffee
with a smile

669
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:42,620
I've noticed.
You've stopped smiling nowadays

670
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:45,707
There are just two things
I'm used to in Shimla

671
01:17:45,707 --> 01:17:49,002
The first is the coffee...
the other's your smile

672
01:17:56,593 --> 01:18:02,057
How's Khushi?

673
01:18:04,601 --> 01:18:07,854
It's so difficult to decide
about the wedding

674
01:18:07,854 --> 01:18:12,192
"At times, I feel like waiting.
At times, I feel like going ahead"

675
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:16,863
What do you think?

676
01:18:16,863 --> 01:18:20,158
Since when you have begun to think?

677
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:26,289
"Well... I thought I'd rather use
my brains, if not my heart"

678
01:18:28,416 --> 01:18:31,878
But the brains and the heart
never agree on anything

679
01:18:31,878 --> 01:18:35,757
Which is why I've come
to take your advise

680
01:18:35,757 --> 01:18:39,135
I think I'd rather compromise
and decide to marry her

681
01:18:42,305 --> 01:18:45,433
What do you think?

682
01:18:45,433 --> 01:18:50,772
What do you think?

683
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:53,817
I think...

684
01:18:53,817 --> 01:18:58,530
"I must leave. Else, my heart and
my brains will be at loggerheads again"

685
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:05,745
Your coffee?
- No... some other day

686
01:19:25,306 --> 01:19:27,934
What are you wearing?

687
01:19:27,934 --> 01:19:30,395
Why? What's wrong with this?

688
01:19:30,395 --> 01:19:36,609
Very little clothes.
Go and change

689
01:19:37,485 --> 01:19:42,073
Go!

690
01:19:48,788 --> 01:19:54,252
"Behind the bungalow,
under the tree, my love..."

691
01:19:56,296 --> 01:20:01,801
the thorn pierced me...

692
01:20:02,761 --> 01:20:06,097
"Ranvir, this is Gaurav from Delhi.
- Go on"

693
01:20:06,598 --> 01:20:09,976
The boss has called everyone back.
He's allotting a new project

694
01:20:10,393 --> 01:20:13,646
Come back at the earliest. Okay?
- All right

695
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:34,918
Whose call was it?
- From the office

696
01:20:34,918 --> 01:20:38,088
What's the matter?
- They've called me back

697
01:20:39,964 --> 01:20:43,551
"To make the same lifeless buildings,
factories and laboratories"

698
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:50,433
What do you want to do?

699
01:20:50,433 --> 01:20:53,812
"I want to make homes,
not houses"

700
01:20:53,812 --> 01:20:59,025
So why don't you tell your boss?

701
01:20:59,025 --> 01:21:02,862
"Once this home is completed,
they'll understand on their own..."

702
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:08,576
what I'm capable of doing
and what I want to do

703
01:21:48,992 --> 01:21:51,202
"Sir, did you send for me?"

704
01:21:51,202 --> 01:21:54,456
Yes. I'm told you're
leaving the company?

705
01:21:56,082 --> 01:21:59,377
"This isn't merely a company,
young man"

706
01:21:59,377 --> 01:22:02,672
This is an army. Do you know the
punishment for deserting the army?

707
01:22:04,549 --> 01:22:08,928
But I'm not letting you go

708
01:22:08,928 --> 01:22:12,223
Because I have got to know
what you intend to do

709
01:22:12,974 --> 01:22:15,268
Who told you that I...

710
01:22:15,268 --> 01:22:20,398
"Ranvir, in you I see
my youth and my obsession"

711
01:22:21,232 --> 01:22:24,402
"Like you, I didn't want to build
make match-boxes either"

712
01:22:24,402 --> 01:22:28,531
I wanted to build homes in which
lives could thrive and grow

713
01:22:30,867 --> 01:22:33,620
You know so much about me?

714
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:38,833
I'm told you have spent very little
money and with your brains...

715
01:22:39,209 --> 01:22:43,880
"you have built a beautiful house?
- Yes, sir"

716
01:22:45,256 --> 01:22:47,676
If what I have heard
about you is true...

717
01:22:47,676 --> 01:22:52,722
this brigadier will finance
your blue-print

718
01:22:54,891 --> 01:22:57,727
"What are you saying, sir?"

719
01:22:57,727 --> 01:23:01,231
"Congratulations on your wedding!
I will surely attend it, Ranvir"

720
01:23:01,648 --> 01:23:05,235
"After I've seen your house, I will
decide on making you my partner"

721
01:23:07,195 --> 01:23:09,572
My wedding? A partner?

722
01:23:09,572 --> 01:23:12,617
"You are a very lucky man, my friend"

723
01:23:12,617 --> 01:23:16,746
Your wedding will bring together
two separated souls

724
01:23:17,122 --> 01:23:20,583
I... and Bakshi

725
01:23:20,583 --> 01:23:24,379
It's the same Bakshi whose bravery
saved my life on the battlefield

726
01:23:24,838 --> 01:23:28,258
He's the one who took the bullet
meant for me

727
01:23:28,258 --> 01:23:33,221
He's the one whose beautiful
daughter you are marrying

728
01:23:39,561 --> 01:23:43,857
"Come, my child"

729
01:23:43,857 --> 01:23:48,903
I got to know only today that the
bullet made Bakshi lose his memory

730
01:23:49,946 --> 01:23:52,407
A colonel of the Punjab regiment...

731
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:55,994
thinks he's an ordinary soldier
of the Maratha regiment!

732
01:23:57,203 --> 01:24:01,291
"Till your marriage takes place,
you are on leave, Ranvir"

733
01:24:01,666 --> 01:24:04,919
Go and get on with your wedding
and your house. Hurry up

734
01:24:10,842 --> 01:24:14,554
Do you dream which fraud you will
play at what time and where?

735
01:24:14,971 --> 01:24:18,475
"You won't see reason, mister. Not even
after overcoming such a big hurdle"

736
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:22,687
"You were amazing today, I must say"

737
01:24:22,687 --> 01:24:25,482
But what made you come
all this way?

738
01:24:25,482 --> 01:24:29,319
You made a mistake. You didn't reveal
your dreams to anyone else...

739
01:24:29,694 --> 01:24:33,156
but you told me about them

740
01:24:33,156 --> 01:24:36,785
"Remember, I once told you that
I see a lot of dreams too?"

741
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:42,082
But you know? Your dreams are
better than mine. They are practical

742
01:24:42,499 --> 01:24:46,378
And I'm sure you will
fulfill them

743
01:24:46,378 --> 01:24:50,507
"If one wishes well,
his dreams come true"

744
01:24:50,507 --> 01:24:55,929
Your dreams will come true too

745
01:24:58,056 --> 01:25:01,184
This is the first time
someone has shown faith in me...

746
01:25:01,184 --> 01:25:04,354
may I know the reason why?

747
01:25:04,354 --> 01:25:07,399
Is it necessary to
spell it out?

748
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:10,694
But one has to decide things.
- What?

749
01:25:12,487 --> 01:25:14,864
We must take this game of marriage
to its logical conclusion

750
01:25:14,864 --> 01:25:19,953
"Without that, we can achieve nothing"

751
01:25:19,953 --> 01:25:24,958
It has become necessary for
the boss to see my house

752
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:27,252
Will you stand by me?

753
01:25:27,252 --> 01:25:30,797
It's going to be fun. I've been
doing it all my life

754
01:25:31,214 --> 01:25:33,508
I used to play games at
other people's marriages

755
01:25:33,508 --> 01:25:36,636
Now I'll play a game with my
own marriage. It'll be fun

756
01:25:36,636 --> 01:25:42,684
Shall we go then?
- And Puja...?

757
01:25:44,769 --> 01:25:49,774
This is the first time in the game
that I've forgotten about her

758
01:25:52,444 --> 01:25:55,238
There's just one way out

759
01:25:55,238 --> 01:25:57,615
"At the wedding altar,
I'll say..."

760
01:25:57,615 --> 01:26:00,660
I'm sure you haven't been
able to forget Puja

761
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:04,122
And that I refuse to marry!

762
01:26:04,122 --> 01:26:07,876
Our game might yet reach
its logical conclusion

763
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:12,547
"Right then... at the wedding altar,
you can marry Puja"

764
01:26:15,258 --> 01:26:19,179
Possibly. Shall we go?

765
01:26:19,179 --> 01:26:23,850
Sure

766
01:26:26,478 --> 01:26:30,857
Didn't I tell you? The Maratha
Regiment is proud of Col Bakshi!

767
01:26:32,525 --> 01:26:36,071
I don't get this! How can you
compare my boss with these folks?

768
01:26:36,488 --> 01:26:39,324
"Watch your manners, Captain!"

769
01:26:39,324 --> 01:26:42,494
You're talking to
your commanding officer!

770
01:26:43,453 --> 01:26:48,708
I'll shoot you!

771
01:26:49,417 --> 01:26:52,587
I'm glad you told the boss that
the bullet has grazed his brains

772
01:26:52,587 --> 01:26:55,715
What's he talking about?
- That he's crazy

773
01:26:55,715 --> 01:26:58,051
Do we have another way?

774
01:26:58,051 --> 01:27:00,178
I don't get this

775
01:27:00,178 --> 01:27:03,515
"Will they emerge from a military
convoy, or must we do something?"

776
01:27:06,184 --> 01:27:08,520
"Okay, tell them that
my friend Gaurav..."

777
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:13,483
will receive them with new clothes
in 15 days time

778
01:27:13,483 --> 01:27:17,445
Does he know who my tailor is?

779
01:27:17,445 --> 01:27:24,119
You clown! Have you ever worn
anything except shorts?

780
01:27:29,249 --> 01:27:32,460
You've now enlisted my entire team
as part of your drama

781
01:27:35,296 --> 01:27:37,924
What do you want now?

782
01:27:37,924 --> 01:27:41,636
Won't you buy your bride a
wedding-attire and jewellery?

783
01:27:41,636 --> 01:27:44,180
Anything else?

784
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:50,020
"You won't ask me to build
a loony bin later, will you?"

785
01:28:13,835 --> 01:28:18,131
What happened?

786
01:28:18,131 --> 01:28:22,385
How do I look?

787
01:28:22,385 --> 01:28:27,015
Really?

788
01:28:42,697 --> 01:28:46,326
"Hello, rotten...?
Will you say something?"

789
01:28:48,953 --> 01:28:53,416
Fraud! She's like the engine of an
aircraft in an auto-rickshaw's body

790
01:28:56,002 --> 01:28:59,381
Take a look at him!
Bitter all the way

791
01:29:00,465 --> 01:29:05,553
Ask him to smile and he takes
a whole five minutes

792
01:29:05,553 --> 01:29:09,474
And he acts as if he were
James Bond's disciple!

793
01:29:12,686 --> 01:29:18,149
"She's not bad to look at,
but she talks too much"

794
01:29:19,234 --> 01:29:22,278
The one who marries her...

795
01:29:22,278 --> 01:29:28,284
This idiot will have
to marry a dumb girl

796
01:29:28,284 --> 01:29:33,998
Did you say something?
- No

797
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:38,878
One mustn't fall in love.
- Why?

798
01:29:38,878 --> 01:29:42,340
Because love puts an end
to friendship

799
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:45,593
One starts fighting and...
everything goes wrong

800
01:29:47,429 --> 01:29:50,265
No?

801
01:29:50,306 --> 01:29:55,895
"One mustn't, right?
- No"

802
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:16,041
Mother...
- Brother is here!

803
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:17,667
So you're back from Delhi!

804
01:30:17,667 --> 01:30:20,503
She wasn't ready to stay here
a single moment without you

805
01:30:20,503 --> 01:30:22,589
She ran after you

806
01:30:22,589 --> 01:30:29,387
Lucky boy.
- We have decided to get married

807
01:30:41,316 --> 01:30:43,526
"Suddenly, how did you...?"

808
01:30:43,526 --> 01:30:46,988
"Well, there it is"

809
01:30:46,988 --> 01:30:50,283
"When is the wedding, brother?
- On the 16th of this month"

810
01:30:50,825 --> 01:30:54,204
So soon?
- Make up your minds

811
01:30:54,204 --> 01:30:58,958
"You say it's getting late,
and you say it's too early"

812
01:30:58,958 --> 01:31:03,171
But how about Khushi's parents?
- We've spoken to them

813
01:31:04,381 --> 01:31:06,800
They'll be there at the wedding.
- They'll be there!

814
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:10,804
They own a helicopter company?
- Let that be

815
01:31:10,804 --> 01:31:14,808
It's such a happy occasion
and you're scolding him

816
01:31:15,141 --> 01:31:19,020
"Give them your blessings,
congratulate them... that's it"

817
01:31:21,231 --> 01:31:27,862
"No, no...
the two of you together"

818
01:31:58,018 --> 01:32:01,563
One moment

819
01:32:01,563 --> 01:32:02,939
Aunt!

820
01:32:02,939 --> 01:32:04,941
Khushi!

821
01:32:04,941 --> 01:32:08,319
I have great news!
I'm getting married

822
01:32:08,695 --> 01:32:12,157
When?
- On the 16th of this month

823
01:32:12,157 --> 01:32:15,410
What?

824
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:18,997
"Surprised, aren't you?
I'm only joking, aunt"

825
01:32:18,997 --> 01:32:21,207
"What are you talking about, dear?"

826
01:32:21,207 --> 01:32:25,170
I don't have the time to explain.
But think it's my marriage

827
01:32:25,712 --> 01:32:27,881
Even if it's make-believe

828
01:32:27,881 --> 01:32:30,383
"I'm beginning to get worried
about you, Khushi"

829
01:32:30,383 --> 01:32:33,094
Do you realize what you're doing?

830
01:32:33,094 --> 01:32:38,892
"No, I don't. All I know is
that I'm shaping a dream..."

831
01:32:39,351 --> 01:32:41,728
a beautiful dream of my marriage

832
01:32:41,728 --> 01:32:47,025
"For a minute, I thought you
are really getting married"

833
01:32:50,028 --> 01:32:56,451
"No, aunt. If that were true,
it would have been amazing"

834
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:02,957
"But I told you, it's not true.
It's only a dream"

835
01:33:02,957 --> 01:33:06,544
And you've got to come
and embellish it with me

836
01:33:06,544 --> 01:33:08,963
"You will come, won't you?"

837
01:33:08,963 --> 01:33:13,176
Shut your eyes and start dreaming.
We'll be there

838
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:22,644
Jonathan...

839
01:33:23,436 --> 01:33:26,856
I'm a nut!
I'm lost in my own dreams

840
01:33:47,127 --> 01:33:50,588
You never told me...
- What?

841
01:33:50,588 --> 01:33:54,509
What your dream is all about

842
01:33:54,509 --> 01:33:59,681
Must I tell you?
- Yes

843
01:33:59,681 --> 01:34:04,728
I dream of the heavens...
with someone of my own with me

844
01:34:07,313 --> 01:34:11,484
That's all I dream of

845
01:34:11,484 --> 01:34:14,612
"Some times, I begin to
believe in the dream"

846
01:34:14,612 --> 01:34:19,951
Like these clouds. I feel that
I might be able to touch them

847
01:34:21,953 --> 01:34:27,292
"But then, I'm afraid.
- Of what?"

848
01:34:27,959 --> 01:34:32,672
What if it turns out to be a fake?
- If you don't believe in your dream...

849
01:34:33,173 --> 01:34:38,636
how will it come true?

850
01:34:46,978 --> 01:34:52,025
So tell me...
do you believe in it now?

851
01:34:52,025 --> 01:34:56,696
A bit

852
01:36:09,519 --> 01:36:15,400
"Khushi... she's very mischievous.
But she's sensible too"

853
01:36:21,823 --> 01:36:24,868
What I could never say...

854
01:36:24,868 --> 01:36:28,204
she has done in a single day

855
01:36:28,204 --> 01:36:31,458
"I don't know how she
stole my dreams..."

856
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:36,504
"and lay them before my boss.
I'm beginning to think..."

857
01:36:38,631 --> 01:36:43,636
that everything will be all right

858
01:36:43,636 --> 01:36:46,931
"Whoever decided to call you Khushi
did it after a lot of thought"

859
01:36:54,064 --> 01:36:59,736
"May your dreams
come true too"

860
01:37:47,242 --> 01:37:51,663
What I've got to tell you today...

861
01:37:52,414 --> 01:37:56,042
"I will say to no one else
ever again"

862
01:37:58,837 --> 01:38:03,299
I've got to stay with you...

863
01:38:04,217 --> 01:38:08,722
"or not live
in this world at all"

864
01:38:09,514 --> 01:38:15,020
"In love,
we will live..."

865
01:38:15,687 --> 01:38:20,525
"in love,
we will die..."

866
01:38:21,735 --> 01:38:25,697
"the anguish of separation
we will not bear"

867
01:39:09,741 --> 01:39:13,870
Fear not the world...

868
01:39:15,789 --> 01:39:19,125
or don't fall in love

869
01:39:21,461 --> 01:39:26,800
We will not look away...

870
01:39:27,509 --> 01:39:30,970
"from each other, my love"

871
01:39:32,347 --> 01:39:37,435
"We shall immerse ourselves
on the shores..."

872
01:39:38,144 --> 01:39:43,024
"we shall rejoice
at our goal..."

873
01:39:44,109 --> 01:39:48,279
"we shall not be washed
away in the seas"

874
01:39:50,573 --> 01:39:54,869
What I've got to tell you today...

875
01:39:55,787 --> 01:40:00,166
"I will say to no one else
ever again"

876
01:42:42,746 --> 01:42:44,831
I'll manage it...

877
01:42:44,831 --> 01:42:47,250
"but, father..."

878
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:53,506
do what you want to.
Why are you asking me?

879
01:43:03,558 --> 01:43:06,019
What do you want? Ever since
you have arrived...

880
01:43:06,019 --> 01:43:09,397
"everything has changed for the worse!
You took over my family, my life..."

881
01:43:09,731 --> 01:43:14,986
my thoughts and now...

882
01:43:14,986 --> 01:43:17,489
"Was it me, or you?"

883
01:43:17,489 --> 01:43:22,619
"Was it I who did what happened,
or was it you?"

884
01:43:22,619 --> 01:43:27,540
Was it I who changed the decisions
or was it you?

885
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:32,962
You! I know your lot very well.
You had come with the intention...

886
01:43:34,089 --> 01:43:39,803
of taking everything I possess

887
01:43:59,948 --> 01:44:03,326
"Aunt, this is Khushi here"

888
01:44:03,326 --> 01:44:07,455
"Khushi, why are you crying?
What is the matter?"

889
01:44:09,332 --> 01:44:14,170
"Aunt, I..."

890
01:44:29,561 --> 01:44:34,733
"Was it I who did what happened,
or was it you?"

891
01:44:34,733 --> 01:44:40,447
Was it I who changed the decisions
or was it you?

892
01:44:59,341 --> 01:45:00,383
Who is it?

893
01:45:00,383 --> 01:45:03,720
"This is Agnihotri from Mall Road.
- Yes, son?"

894
01:45:04,095 --> 01:45:07,640
I'm sorry for being intrusive

895
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:12,187
But I've seen your daughter-in-law
at the bus-stop just now

896
01:45:12,187 --> 01:45:15,523
She looks worried and she's
also carrying her bags

897
01:45:16,232 --> 01:45:19,069
So I thought I should inform you

898
01:45:19,069 --> 01:45:23,948
"You've done the right thing,
there's something wrong"

899
01:45:31,206 --> 01:45:34,584
"Even if everything divine
comes to an end..."

900
01:45:36,002 --> 01:45:40,507
"even if you have
to forsake the world..."

901
01:45:41,633 --> 01:45:45,095
"even if God turns
against you..."

902
01:45:46,096 --> 01:45:50,934
"may your beloved never
be angry with you"

903
01:46:29,764 --> 01:46:33,184
"Placate your sulking beloved,
O silly boy..."

904
01:46:33,601 --> 01:46:36,730
"God will Himself
be placated"

905
01:46:36,730 --> 01:46:40,358
"Placate your beloved
who's sulking..."

906
01:46:40,775 --> 01:46:47,407
and God will be placated

907
01:47:15,352 --> 01:47:19,481
"When the beloved is separated,
when the beloved is angry..."

908
01:47:19,814 --> 01:47:24,277
"even death does not come to you,
life becomes a punishment"

909
01:47:24,736 --> 01:47:29,282
"What life is this? You are here,
your beloved is elsewhere"

910
01:47:29,699 --> 01:47:32,035
"Your beloved means
everything to you..."

911
01:47:32,035 --> 01:47:38,583
"without her,
there's nothing for you"

912
01:47:45,006 --> 01:47:48,343
"Placate your beloved
who's sulking..."

913
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:52,347
and God will be placated

914
01:48:19,916 --> 01:48:23,962
"Light up your heart
with love, O silly boy..."

915
01:48:26,548 --> 01:48:29,426
O silly boy...

916
01:48:29,426 --> 01:48:33,763
"light up your heart
with love"

917
01:48:34,180 --> 01:48:36,558
"Your house is lonely
without her..."

918
01:48:36,558 --> 01:48:38,768
go and bring her home

919
01:48:38,768 --> 01:48:42,063
"Placate your beloved
who's sulking, O silly boy..."

920
01:48:42,063 --> 01:48:45,859
and God will be placated

921
01:49:15,972 --> 01:49:20,226
"This is the ocean of love,
it flows the other way"

922
01:49:20,602 --> 01:49:22,687
"Those that swam across,
have drowned..."

923
01:49:22,687 --> 01:49:25,148
"and those that drown
have swum across"

924
01:49:25,148 --> 01:49:28,401
"Placate your beloved
who's sulking, O naive one..."

925
01:49:28,735 --> 01:49:33,198
and God will be placated

926
01:49:42,332 --> 01:49:45,627
"Should you not make up with her
and prevent a separation..."

927
01:49:45,627 --> 01:49:49,047
"you will have no cure
for your lovelorn heart"

928
01:49:49,464 --> 01:49:52,842
"Love is a verdict
pronounced by nature..."

929
01:49:52,842 --> 01:49:56,680
"there is no verdict
beyond this decision"

930
01:49:57,097 --> 01:50:00,642
"Placate your beloved
who's sulking..."

931
01:50:01,101 --> 01:50:07,732
and God will be placated

932
01:51:01,870 --> 01:51:05,498
"For whatever I did,
I'm..."

933
01:51:08,877 --> 01:51:10,503
There's no need for that

934
01:51:10,503 --> 01:51:15,342
"I told you, I've stopped expecting
goodness from men like you"

935
01:51:18,595 --> 01:51:23,141
"I don't want your salary,
nor your furniture nor anything else"

936
01:51:25,810 --> 01:51:29,022
but I do wish to clear
your misgivings

937
01:51:29,022 --> 01:51:32,942
I haven't come back
for your sake

938
01:51:32,942 --> 01:51:36,780
"I have come back for those whom
you had, and never appreciated..."

939
01:51:37,322 --> 01:51:41,368
and whom I see for
what they are worth

940
01:51:41,368 --> 01:51:46,664
"So we needn't say anything to each
other anymore. Not today, not ever"

941
01:51:56,549 --> 01:52:01,262
I was perhaps dreaming.
And I'm glad you woke me up

942
01:52:01,805 --> 01:52:08,019
Because I have begun
to hate the dream

943
01:53:49,871 --> 01:53:52,791
"You asked for some samples for
the decoration of your house, sir"

944
01:53:52,791 --> 01:53:58,129
Here they are

945
01:54:08,723 --> 01:54:11,768
Since you are doing the
decoration of the house...

946
01:54:11,768 --> 01:54:16,648
here it is

947
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:46,970
"Mother, my dream
has been fulfilled"

948
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:53,560
The house is ready

949
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:59,232
Would you like to take a look?

950
01:55:32,015 --> 01:55:36,686
We have moved closer...

951
01:55:37,187 --> 01:55:42,233
"you have taken away
with yourself..."

952
01:55:42,650 --> 01:55:47,364
"my sleep, my dreams..."

953
01:55:47,781 --> 01:55:52,660
"take me along too,
my love"

954
01:55:53,036 --> 01:55:57,999
"I implore you, my love"

955
01:55:58,416 --> 01:56:03,838
We have moved closer...

956
01:56:04,255 --> 01:56:09,469
"you have taken away
with yourself..."

957
01:57:02,981 --> 01:57:08,236
"Ask me for my life,
ask me for my heart..."

958
01:57:08,862 --> 01:57:13,700
"ask me for a denial,
ask me to acquiesce..."

959
01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:19,581
"you may even seek
the world from me today"

960
01:57:21,833 --> 01:57:27,088
We have moved closer...

961
01:57:27,547 --> 01:57:32,510
"you have taken away
with yourself..."

962
01:58:05,293 --> 01:58:10,256
"We're so close,
I can see nothing else"

963
01:58:10,799 --> 01:58:15,470
"I'm lost to myself
and to everyone else"

964
01:58:16,012 --> 01:58:21,184
"Find me, if I ever
lose my way"

965
01:58:24,104 --> 01:58:28,942
We have moved closer...

966
01:58:29,401 --> 01:58:34,364
"you have taken away
with yourself..."

967
01:58:34,781 --> 01:58:39,619
"my sleep, my dreams..."

968
01:58:39,994 --> 01:58:44,833
"take me along too,
my love"

969
01:58:45,291 --> 01:58:50,422
"I implore you, my love"

970
01:59:17,574 --> 01:59:21,119
"Welcome, sister-in-law!
- Do not feel shy"

971
01:59:24,622 --> 01:59:30,337
"Biji, sister-in-law has arrived"

972
01:59:33,214 --> 01:59:37,886
My child!

973
01:59:38,345 --> 01:59:42,182
You came to this house
as its happiness

974
01:59:43,683 --> 01:59:48,355
"But now, you shall
be its goddess of wealth"

975
01:59:48,897 --> 01:59:53,902
Welcome inside

976
01:59:55,070 --> 02:00:01,159
We will light lamps
in the whole house tonight...

977
02:00:01,159 --> 02:00:07,290
"for you shall light up
our lives from today, my child"

978
02:00:08,166 --> 02:00:13,380
"Come, dear. Come on"

979
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:22,263
"O Mother, send my father..."

980
02:00:23,390 --> 02:00:29,938
for Spring has arrived

981
02:00:44,953 --> 02:00:50,667
"My child, we are
estranged from your father..."

982
02:00:51,334 --> 02:00:58,133
"I know, Spring has arrived"

983
02:00:58,550 --> 02:01:04,139
"O Mother, send my father..."

984
02:02:12,707 --> 02:02:17,921
Let go of my hand!

985
02:02:39,901 --> 02:02:46,199
What's happening between
the two of you?

986
02:02:47,409 --> 02:02:53,081
Won't you even tell me?

987
02:02:55,291 --> 02:02:59,337
"There was nothing between us, Biji.
It was just a game..."

988
02:03:00,797 --> 02:03:05,176
I had played so I could have Puja

989
02:03:05,176 --> 02:03:09,014
And when that game
turned into reality...

990
02:03:09,014 --> 02:03:12,809
I didn't even get to know.
I really fell in love with her

991
02:03:13,518 --> 02:03:16,730
So... why don't you tell her?

992
02:03:19,941 --> 02:03:23,653
What will I say?
How will I say...

993
02:03:25,697 --> 02:03:29,117
"that I am suddenly in love
with her, and not Puja?"

994
02:03:32,162 --> 02:03:36,166
"In this very dilemma, I said
so many nasty things to her"

995
02:03:38,335 --> 02:03:42,672
I have hurt her very much.
It was all my fault...

996
02:03:44,841 --> 02:03:48,720
and I held her guilty.
- My son...

997
02:03:51,097 --> 02:03:54,225
if you have made a mistake...

998
02:03:54,225 --> 02:03:58,480
you will not be belittled
by admitting it

999
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:02,567
Go to her and tell her

1000
02:04:02,567 --> 02:04:06,738
Maybe you will not have the
opportunity after tomorrow

1001
02:04:06,738 --> 02:04:13,453
You will regret it then.
Go and stop her... Go on

1002
02:04:34,724 --> 02:04:38,019
The bridegroom...? Here?

1003
02:04:38,019 --> 02:04:43,566
He mustn't have been able
to stop himself!

1004
02:04:43,566 --> 02:04:47,946
I know why you have come here.
Your job will be done

1005
02:04:49,322 --> 02:04:50,657
I wish to talk to you...

1006
02:04:50,657 --> 02:04:53,868
Your mother says the
bride and bridegroom...

1007
02:04:53,868 --> 02:05:00,542
can't spend time together
before the wedding

1008
02:05:23,982 --> 02:05:29,237
"Jonathan, it isn't a nice world.
It isn't Jonathan"

1009
02:05:30,238 --> 02:05:33,366
We shouldn't have
come here at all

1010
02:05:33,366 --> 02:05:36,369
I can't play this game anymore

1011
02:05:36,369 --> 02:05:43,752
My dreams have soured...
I don't know what to do

1012
02:06:20,038 --> 02:06:22,165
"Open the door, Khushi"

1013
02:06:22,165 --> 02:06:27,212
"Open the door, my child.
- Open the door, Khushi"

1014
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:33,968
"No, Biji. I'm not coming"

1015
02:06:33,968 --> 02:06:39,099
What happened?

1016
02:06:43,311 --> 02:06:46,189
"What happened, Biji?
- I don't get this"

1017
02:06:46,189 --> 02:06:49,984
"Khushi's not opening the door.
- It's the wedding day, after all"

1018
02:06:50,402 --> 02:06:52,696
She must be scared

1019
02:06:52,696 --> 02:06:59,160
My son... call her parents.
They'll take care of everything

1020
02:07:23,977 --> 02:07:28,106
"We have guests, dear.
Let's go"

1021
02:07:39,409 --> 02:07:43,038
My child! We are here
to take you away

1022
02:07:44,622 --> 02:07:51,129
Uncle! Aunt! Go away...
this marriage is not taking place

1023
02:07:51,129 --> 02:07:54,257
It was inevitable

1024
02:07:54,257 --> 02:07:58,720
My darling daughter...
how she has been hurt

1025
02:08:02,474 --> 02:08:05,727
Think about it

1026
02:08:05,727 --> 02:08:10,899
These folks don't know
our child is an orphan

1027
02:08:15,904 --> 02:08:21,826
What will happen
of our child?

1028
02:08:25,330 --> 02:08:28,792
What are we to do now?
- What?

1029
02:08:29,751 --> 02:08:32,879
Have we ever done something
that we will do it now?

1030
02:08:32,879 --> 02:08:38,301
We can do nothing

1031
02:08:45,141 --> 02:08:50,563
"Open the door, my child"

1032
02:08:53,775 --> 02:09:01,032
"My child, everyone of us
has given you so much of love"

1033
02:09:02,951 --> 02:09:07,622
If you have found even a little
bit of honesty in our love...

1034
02:09:09,165 --> 02:09:14,295
"I implore you in the name of that
honesty... open the door, my dear"

1035
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:53,543
"My child, all we have
come to tell you..."

1036
02:09:55,045 --> 02:10:00,175
is that the bridegroom needs
no one else on the wedding day

1037
02:10:01,593 --> 02:10:06,806
But the bride...

1038
02:10:06,806 --> 02:10:10,894
the bride needs everyone

1039
02:10:10,894 --> 02:10:19,903
"So we have decided that all of us
will stay with you, not with him"

1040
02:10:22,197 --> 02:10:28,161
"From today, I am not his Biji.
I am your Biji"

1041
02:10:30,455 --> 02:10:37,170
And he isn't his father...
he's your father now

1042
02:10:40,382 --> 02:10:47,055
And she isn't his mother anymore.
She's your mother

1043
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:55,105
And this idiot!
He's your uncle

1044
02:10:57,857 --> 02:11:03,446
"We're all your very own, my child.
We belong to you"

1045
02:11:05,198 --> 02:11:09,369
I know how difficult
this journey can be

1046
02:11:11,538 --> 02:11:14,749
"But my child, I give you my word..."

1047
02:11:15,792 --> 02:11:20,547
take the first step.
You will not be alone

1048
02:11:20,922 --> 02:11:25,844
You'll find a new relationship
at every step

1049
02:11:25,844 --> 02:11:30,265
"At every turn, a brother will
lend you a helping hand"

1050
02:11:31,349 --> 02:11:38,398
A mother will pamper you.
And a father will be your support

1051
02:11:40,483 --> 02:11:46,448
"We belong to you, my child"

1052
02:11:52,120 --> 02:11:57,000
"Now look, my child.
The compassion in your eyes..."

1053
02:11:57,459 --> 02:12:06,217
holds happiness for all of us.
Do not refuse us. Please don't

1054
02:12:48,593 --> 02:12:53,348
"Quietly, stealthily,
he will arrive..."

1055
02:12:53,807 --> 02:12:58,687
and he'll whisk me away

1056
02:12:58,687 --> 02:13:01,898
"This is what our lives
are all about..."

1057
02:13:01,898 --> 02:13:04,401
"there's this much
to our dream"

1058
02:13:04,401 --> 02:13:09,114
"A dream you have, I have,
everyone of us has..."

1059
02:13:09,531 --> 02:13:14,994
"may my dream never be shattered,
may my lover never be angry with me"

1060
02:13:15,537 --> 02:13:20,166
"Quietly, stealthily,
he will arrive..."

1061
02:13:20,750 --> 02:13:24,504
and he'll whisk me away

1062
02:13:46,776 --> 02:13:51,322
"This is a relationship
that transcends many births..."

1063
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:56,077
a marriage is all about destiny

1064
02:13:57,245 --> 02:14:03,251
"May misfortune never strike,
may my lover never be angry with me"

1065
02:14:03,752 --> 02:14:08,590
"Quietly, stealthily,
he will arrive..."

1066
02:14:09,049 --> 02:14:13,303
and he'll take me away

1067
02:14:54,260 --> 02:14:58,598
I possess a heart full of desire...

1068
02:14:59,057 --> 02:15:03,353
"and people accuse it
of being evil"

1069
02:15:04,437 --> 02:15:10,610
"May he never plunder me,
may my beloved never be angry with me"

1070
02:15:11,111 --> 02:15:16,032
"Quietly, stealthily,
he will arrive..."

1071
02:15:16,574 --> 02:15:20,704
and he'll whisk me away

1072
02:16:13,131 --> 02:16:19,262
I can't do what you want me to

1073
02:16:19,262 --> 02:16:22,891
They have given me so much
of love and affection...

1074
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:29,856
please don't compel me to enact
a farce in their presence

1075
02:16:29,856 --> 02:16:34,694
"Won't you stand by me,
now that we have got here?"

1076
02:16:34,694 --> 02:16:37,947
"If you don't help me,
what will happen of all those things?"

1077
02:16:39,032 --> 02:16:43,620
But they were just a dream.
Lies

1078
02:16:43,620 --> 02:16:47,540
"A dream, it was.
But was it a lie?"

1079
02:16:49,668 --> 02:16:53,213
I don't remember anything.
- I remember it all

1080
02:16:53,838 --> 02:16:57,300
I know what you wanted.
A companion...

1081
02:16:58,218 --> 02:17:05,809
who will take all your sorrows
and give you all his happiness

1082
02:17:08,269 --> 02:17:11,815
That's what I am doing.
I give you all my happiness...

1083
02:17:14,526 --> 02:17:18,196
won't you give me your sorrow?

1084
02:17:24,035 --> 02:17:27,580
Man some times mistakes
his stubbornness for love

1085
02:17:30,291 --> 02:17:33,545
I too perhaps mistook my
stubbornness to have Puja...

1086
02:17:33,586 --> 02:17:37,924
to be my love.
And today...

1087
02:17:51,271 --> 02:17:56,985
will you marry me?

1088
02:18:01,698 --> 02:18:05,035
Tell me... is this a dream
or is it true?

1089
02:18:06,077 --> 02:18:11,750
The decision is up to you

1090
02:18:56,795 --> 02:19:01,466
Should we embrace...

1091
02:19:02,050 --> 02:19:06,638
"should love bring
the hues..."

1092
02:19:07,472 --> 02:19:13,311
"may the hues never fade,
may my beloved never be angry"

1093
02:19:13,728 --> 02:19:18,525
"Quietly, stealthily,
he will arrive..."

1094
02:19:18,983 --> 02:19:23,863
and he'll take me away
