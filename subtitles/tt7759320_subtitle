1
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:06,670
Smoking and alcohol consumption
are injurious to health.

2
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,268
Dickey open, sir.

3
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,893
When it is tough for this car
to climb the ramp, how if you stop here?

4
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:34,893
Dickey open, sir.

5
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:41,268
Check fast, it seems offers there
are going down at the rate of hours.

6
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:43,476
This is too much.

7
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:46,226
You have been writing articles
in this book from 25 years.

8
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,684
They used to publish
first in the beginning,

9
00:03:47,934 --> 00:03:50,684
then in the middle and now at the end.

10
00:03:50,893 --> 00:03:52,601
Will they stop publishing
next year or what?

11
00:03:52,768 --> 00:03:55,434
It is not important whether
our article is in the book or not

12
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:58,268
but whether we are in the hearts of those
reading that or not is important.

13
00:03:58,351 --> 00:03:59,461
Sir, key.

14
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:08,101
One minute.

15
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:11,643
Sir, come on, sir... Come on.

16
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:13,505
Wait, this is not starting.

17
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:16,705
Ask him, we shall get down and push.

18
00:04:17,143 --> 00:04:18,934
Oh no, you ask.

19
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:21,219
Please, you ask.

20
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:27,812
Hey Jeeva.

21
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,062
I said in advance no for the vehicle
to be in museum to the mall.

22
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:39,520
Did you listen?
No! Your ego being the parents.

23
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:44,692
Go son.

24
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,124
Unless they put a rule that
only the buyers should come to malls,

25
00:05:03,204 --> 00:05:05,113
these parking places will not be vacant.

26
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:08,729
There, we shall park there.

27
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:11,604
Oh no, looks like
the pipe is broken hubby.

28
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,979
Damn, should this break right now?

29
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,018
Where is this fellow?

30
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:35,860
Yes.

31
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:37,895
Hey, will you not come?

32
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:39,479
You go, I will be right here.

33
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:40,520
Not that son.

34
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:41,607
Oh no.

35
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,270
Leave him and you come.

36
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:46,229
Why not you tell him?

37
00:05:46,354 --> 00:05:50,187
We know right, that he does not leave when
he focuses on something unless it is done.

38
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,145
Looks like he is put
the focus on game now.

39
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:56,395
Bad luck, thought focus would
go onto girls if brought for shopping.

40
00:05:56,645 --> 00:05:59,020
No need, phone is better that girls.

41
00:05:59,437 --> 00:06:00,645
You keep saying so.

42
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:04,061
Yes...

43
00:07:07,104 --> 00:07:07,895
Selfie...

44
00:07:29,812 --> 00:07:32,208
I did not get ready properly as I was
coming with father and mother.

45
00:08:02,104 --> 00:08:03,895
Mummy...

46
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:06,821
Mummy.

47
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:10,523
Hey.. My shirt..

48
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:13,145
You Idiot..

49
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:17,354
Bro, why do you hit?

50
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:19,187
He is already so thin
and he would die, bro.

51
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:21,221
Yes, sir, even shirt is wrinkled badly

52
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,357
and they are taking ten
rupees for iron in apartments.

53
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,895
Hey...
- Hey, you uneducated fruit!

54
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:28,357
Here two gentlemen are
talking and you wait there.

55
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:31,062
Idiot, English again.
- Move idiot, move.

56
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:34,937
Hey bro, I would not have asked
if you had put the mess in your house.

57
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:36,354
You put it in a public place.

58
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,395
If someone places hand on me
without permission, I do not like at all.

59
00:08:40,482 --> 00:08:42,562
Say why you are hitting
and that is enough.

60
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:44,104
This is the quality of educated people.

61
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,645
We are educated flowers
and they are uneducated fruits.

62
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:49,270
But when they are hitting no
Zandu balm or tiger balm is working, sir.

63
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,604
They look to have been
directly from C center, sir.

64
00:08:51,937 --> 00:08:53,939
Please save me and God will bless you.

65
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:56,104
He looks to be a mad fellow
and why are you hitting him?

66
00:08:56,312 --> 00:08:59,729
Dirty rogue was completely drunk
and messed with a girl working at our bar.

67
00:08:59,812 --> 00:09:01,270
Say, should we hit or kill that fellow?

68
00:09:01,562 --> 00:09:03,729
It is a lie, sir, I did not pinch her.

69
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:05,895
I just tried her and that is all.

70
00:09:09,104 --> 00:09:09,979
What have you done idiot?

71
00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:11,520
Just tried her, sir.

72
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:12,895
Did you just try?

73
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:16,562
You should visit that bar for sure,
beer is cheap there.

74
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:17,315
I see.

75
00:09:17,395 --> 00:09:20,270
Bar girls more beautiful
than the cheer girls of IPL.

76
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,294
You know why I hit?

77
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:27,354
One, I do not drink and
two is I am really decent.

78
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,270
Hey, what are I and you a team...
You rogue.

79
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:31,812
Get into the trolley, get in.

80
00:09:32,176 --> 00:09:34,979
Sir, you are educated
and ok even if you hit.

81
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:39,328
Please do not hand me over to these
uneducated fruits. Please save me, sir.

82
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,770
God bless you, sir.

83
00:09:48,145 --> 00:09:50,062
How many times did I say
you to eat ice cream properly?

84
00:09:53,104 --> 00:09:55,812
See, you spoilt all your dress
and who will wash these clothes now?

85
00:09:56,187 --> 00:10:02,062
Daddy washes the clothes daily right? Why
are you over acting like you are washing?

86
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:03,520
Your dad is been to Bangalore.

87
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:06,145
and it takes one week for him to be back.
Keep them the same till then.

88
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:07,270
I will.

89
00:10:07,395 --> 00:10:09,895
Hold.
She is doing too much these days.

90
00:10:39,624 --> 00:10:41,145
Hey, where are you going?

91
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,854
Hey, where are you going?

92
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:49,687
Doctor said to take rest for a month.

93
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,229
Why are you down so and walking on?

94
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:54,020
Are you listening to me or not?

95
00:10:58,895 --> 00:10:59,854
Note the number.

96
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:07,979
Keep in touch.

97
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:11,187
Hey..

98
00:11:14,513 --> 00:11:18,440
'You don't have enough
credit balance to make this call.'

99
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:30,354
Excuse me.

100
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,604
Yes, sir.

101
00:11:32,062 --> 00:11:32,979
Can you say the Wifi password please?

102
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:35,020
If you say the order first...

103
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:36,770
Order...

104
00:11:38,695 --> 00:11:40,477
After some five minutes...

105
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:41,854
I will say password then.

106
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,770
Everyone comes with a
phone and asks for password.

107
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:48,052
Excuse me.

108
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:50,645
Can you share your phone wifi?

109
00:11:51,604 --> 00:11:52,812
What the F?

110
00:11:53,675 --> 00:11:55,562
Hello, I asked wifi.

111
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:56,770
I said the password.

112
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:58,729
User name Deepu.

113
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:00,604
It is good.

114
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,229
Hi.

115
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:04,354
Who is this?

116
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:07,400
B 57 parking, Jeeva.

117
00:12:08,265 --> 00:12:09,770
I am Jyosna, Jo.

118
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:13,145
Wow, I am Jee and you are Jo...
Super dude.

119
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,520
Oh, bring own the speed.

120
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,687
Am I faster than you giving number
immediately when met?

121
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:21,562
Fail in first out of the ten tests.

122
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:23,478
Fail?

123
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:25,437
Hello, what is the test?

124
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,812
You made fun of me that
I gave number without asking right?

125
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,106
Oh, sorry.

126
00:12:31,645 --> 00:12:32,936
When did I make fun?

127
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:37,520
Ok, then pass.

128
00:12:42,286 --> 00:12:44,479
Hello..Look there, it is like our fellow.

129
00:12:46,062 --> 00:12:48,437
Not like, but our son.

130
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:53,229
When I kept coffee and water down, why is
he wasting money coming here and drinking?

131
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:56,854
Look, focus is shifted onto some girl.

132
00:12:57,437 --> 00:12:58,270
Oh God...

133
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,229
Come on.
- She is a crazy lady.

134
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:10,024
Both are opposite to each other
and why not directly talk.

135
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:11,187
Why are these phones in between?

136
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,895
Oh no! When would you get updated hubby?

137
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:16,020
This is the trend now. See if you want to.

138
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:25,770
My foot trend,
none in the world living head high.

139
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:28,923
Hi..
- HI.

140
00:13:29,003 --> 00:13:30,312
I am mother of Jeeva.

141
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,936
This is father of Jeeva.

142
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,395
Hi..
- Hi.

143
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:36,854
Oh, who is Jeeva?

144
00:13:38,204 --> 00:13:38,982
I am Jeeva.

145
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:39,937
Oh!

146
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:42,187
Is this the trend?

147
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:56,520
400?

148
00:13:57,774 --> 00:13:58,729
400?

149
00:13:58,895 --> 00:13:59,895
You used right?

150
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:01,395
Just four minutes right?

151
00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:03,395
All would be costly with girls.

152
00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:07,479
You sit son. We are paying 400 right?

153
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:09,104
Use and then come.

154
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:35,979
How did your leg get fractured?

155
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:37,774
When I was going on two wheeler,

156
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,854
my maths teacher came in
wrong route and dashed with car.

157
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:41,895
You should have pulled
her out and given two shots.

158
00:15:42,784 --> 00:15:45,312
I am already weak in maths
and thought why fights with her again.

159
00:15:45,437 --> 00:15:46,312
Are you weak in maths?

160
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,895
I am topper in maths.

161
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:48,805
What?

162
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:49,982
Are you a topper?

163
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:51,604
Then you fail in the test.

164
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:53,104
What, fail? Why?

165
00:15:53,229 --> 00:15:55,269
You are topper in maths right?

166
00:15:56,696 --> 00:16:00,687
I too am weak in maths,
but with slips just so...

167
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:03,395
Ok... Pass.

168
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:42,812
Hi.
- Hi.

169
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:47,979
Is the ice cream good?

170
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:58,270
He is in trial period.

171
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,187
Ok if you say ok and
not ok if you say not ok. Ok?

172
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:06,770
Trial period?

173
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,045
Chill, dude.
- Forget her.

174
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,331
You will find another girl.

175
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:59,802
Is my class so much boring
that you bunked and sat here?

176
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:11,395
What happened Satwik?

177
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:13,196
I do not understand at all, sir.

178
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:16,953
She was one day seen
in the train accidentally.

179
00:19:17,812 --> 00:19:20,502
By the time I thought to share the
phone number, she got missed out.

180
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,394
Again, she unexpectedly
met in the College.

181
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,837
She said love, five years of love, sir.

182
00:19:26,681 --> 00:19:28,450
She again went away from life suddenly.

183
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:31,960
Why to come again and again
and then to leave from life, sir?

184
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:33,700
What exactly is this life, sir?

185
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:35,742
Life!

186
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:41,659
Answers to the questions
we ask do not be in big books only.

187
00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:50,325
Do you know that they exist even
in weekly magazines like this?

188
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:56,284
Connecting dots...

189
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:05,117
Even our life is like
these connecting dots.

190
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:10,950
This journey starts with
one dot and goes dot by dot.

191
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:20,617
Every dot we face may be a person, can
be an incident or may even be a decision.

192
00:20:21,563 --> 00:20:24,784
This journey may have an up or a down.

193
00:20:25,242 --> 00:20:26,950
Anything can happen in one second.

194
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:31,784
Connecting only a few dots,
it is meaningless.

195
00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:36,992
Unless we connect all dots and see,
meaning to our life cannot be known.

196
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:39,325
Now see...

197
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:47,825
Look...

198
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:50,992
Beautiful, sir.

199
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:53,159
Yes, but remember one thing.

200
00:20:53,873 --> 00:20:57,248
There is no rule that life of everyone
must be beautiful like this.

201
00:20:57,748 --> 00:20:58,956
It can be any way.

202
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,604
It depends on the dots
touched in our journey.

203
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:08,535
But those dots, I mean our life journey
is decided by our destiny.

204
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:11,331
Hey Jeeva.

205
00:21:15,428 --> 00:21:16,319
Brother in law.

206
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:18,831
Jeeva, my friend.

207
00:21:18,956 --> 00:21:19,762
Hello.

208
00:21:22,373 --> 00:21:24,456
Jeeva, my brother in law Puppy.

209
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:27,998
I said right,
Bangalore, software, intelligent...

210
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:30,373
Not just that but he is a brave man.

211
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,081
Yes, I am a brave man.

212
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:36,081
Brave?

213
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:39,335
You keep talking,
I will go and bring coffee.

214
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:40,081
Ok.

215
00:21:41,415 --> 00:21:43,290
Mr. Puppy, is this your nick name?

216
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:48,040
My real name is Peddireddy Paparao
and my wife calls me Puppy with love.

217
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,556
No idea why but sometimes pet names by
wives are sweeter than

218
00:21:51,636 --> 00:21:54,040
the cute names by mothers.

219
00:21:55,334 --> 00:21:57,290
Puppy, there is great depth.

220
00:21:58,998 --> 00:22:00,331
Hi Uncle.

221
00:22:00,956 --> 00:22:01,915
Hi..

222
00:22:02,392 --> 00:22:04,040
See what I am giving you..
chocolate.

223
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:08,124
Hello.. you don't know kids are
ate chocolates than form gems..

224
00:22:08,505 --> 00:22:09,998
You didn't see the
tooth paste ads in TV...?

225
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,415
Dad...salt is in our tooth paste.

226
00:22:12,786 --> 00:22:14,831
My foot..! You go in. Go.

227
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,331
He don't have much scene...you give.

228
00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:21,790
Hey, Coffee.

229
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:22,873
Thank you.

230
00:22:23,285 --> 00:22:25,123
Thanks not for me..
say to sister.

231
00:22:25,707 --> 00:22:26,960
Hi Jeeva.
- Hi.

232
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,501
Uncle..! move, we go to Aunt's room.

233
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,256
Come.

234
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:34,706
Aunt's room! hey why Aunt's room!?

235
00:22:35,506 --> 00:22:36,336
Brother in law..

236
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:38,873
He is in trial period.

237
00:22:39,182 --> 00:22:42,165
Ok if you say ok and
not ok if you say not ok.

238
00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:44,562
Ok.

239
00:22:44,642 --> 00:22:47,623
- Ok...!?
- Not that 'Okay'.. Just Ok.

240
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,197
Ok..
- Ok..

241
00:22:52,381 --> 00:22:54,143
Did you see how much
does your sister respect me?

242
00:22:54,223 --> 00:22:55,790
It seems she does not
say ok unless I agree.

243
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,333
She might asked for formality, puppy.

244
00:22:57,413 --> 00:22:59,123
No, she said for real.

245
00:22:59,851 --> 00:23:02,468
I should now think very well and say 'Ok'.

246
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,790
You don't have so much
scene..go and soak the cloths.

247
00:23:04,873 --> 00:23:05,998
Cloths..!

248
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,744
Oh.. cloths.

249
00:23:08,456 --> 00:23:09,206
Ok I will.

250
00:23:09,462 --> 00:23:11,149
Hey.. you, your mom is calling.
Go.

251
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:13,915
My mom too, always into calling me.
- Go.

252
00:23:16,932 --> 00:23:20,623
Uncle, careful... I will come again.

253
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,248
Hey, go rogue.

254
00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:26,831
This girl has no link between
her age and her talks at all.

255
00:23:27,415 --> 00:23:31,081
Wow, what a great interior decoration?

256
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,290
Thank you so much.

257
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:35,790
That colour so romantic...

258
00:23:36,846 --> 00:23:39,956
That combination of red and yellow.

259
00:23:40,456 --> 00:23:42,623
It is very nice.
- Thank you.

260
00:23:42,706 --> 00:23:43,581
That was my selection.

261
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:46,040
So romantic...

262
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,915
How will you sit in this room for a month
without getting bored with the fracture?

263
00:23:49,181 --> 00:23:50,456
Oh, that?

264
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:55,373
I am more interested into watching
Big Boss show in live than in the TV.

265
00:23:56,521 --> 00:23:58,706
There is no TV in your room too
and how will you see the live show?

266
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:00,123
I will show you, come.

267
00:24:11,387 --> 00:24:13,373
That is the stage of my reality shows.

268
00:24:13,992 --> 00:24:14,998
Stage?

269
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:18,623
Total of 40 families and 150 residents.

270
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,581
Each is a different type.

271
00:24:21,123 --> 00:24:23,873
What more would be a better interesting
reality show than this?

272
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,415
You mean to watch all those from here?

273
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:28,040
Yes, It is people watching.

274
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:29,910
People watching?

275
00:24:30,326 --> 00:24:31,743
Is it not wrong to peep
into the life of others?

276
00:24:32,118 --> 00:24:35,035
What are all doing in Face book
and Twitter? It is the same, right?

277
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:41,073
Hey, there look at that left.

278
00:24:43,868 --> 00:24:45,743
I think, I saw him somewhere.

279
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,613
Hey, he is ACP Ramachandra
encounter specialist. - Yes.

280
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:51,535
Old city shivers of him..

281
00:24:52,488 --> 00:24:53,701
Yes... Look there.

282
00:24:59,618 --> 00:25:01,410
What is that, why is he shivering so?

283
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:04,413
Wife?

284
00:25:04,493 --> 00:25:06,785
If wife, she would have
hit and then spoken right?

285
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,701
Oh, dual SIM?

286
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:15,076
I do not know,
they said there down in the gang.

287
00:25:16,985 --> 00:25:19,255
Who are they, meeting of women society.

288
00:25:19,493 --> 00:25:20,993
No, gossip gang.

289
00:25:21,576 --> 00:25:22,726
Gossip gang?

290
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:26,110
They are more interested

291
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,243
about what is happing in
life of the others than their life.

292
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,201
Oh, almost like you.

293
00:25:31,618 --> 00:25:32,326
Hey Jo.

294
00:25:33,277 --> 00:25:34,185
Hi.

295
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,535
She is my friend, leader of gossip gang.

296
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,743
She just saw us right,
they would speak of us now.

297
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:43,368
Gossips about us both? Nice...

298
00:25:45,124 --> 00:25:47,743
Ok, are there no gems
like us in your apartments?

299
00:25:49,118 --> 00:25:50,493
There is one diamond.

300
00:25:50,962 --> 00:25:52,160
Diamond?
- Yes.

301
00:25:52,826 --> 00:25:55,993
Just the only one great bachelor
living amongst so many families.

302
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,676
Where?

303
00:25:57,868 --> 00:25:59,308
There...

304
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,314
I do not understand

305
00:26:11,394 --> 00:26:14,326
what he is trying to do but can understand
that he is trying to do something.

306
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,785
Shut up, that is Yoga.

307
00:26:20,326 --> 00:26:22,951
Oh... That is yoga
and he is Baba Ramdev...

308
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:26,382
He does yoga as and when he gets time

309
00:26:26,462 --> 00:26:28,951
and looks after this
apartment when he is free.

310
00:26:29,515 --> 00:26:31,330
Oh, watchman?

311
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:36,368
No, on the name of Swatch Bharat to keep
this apartment clean he does free service.

312
00:26:39,368 --> 00:26:41,883
When all our heroines are going to zero
size doing yoga,

313
00:26:41,963 --> 00:26:43,585
why is this fellow like a pig?

314
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:44,701
I doubt him.

315
00:26:45,118 --> 00:26:47,535
I will now show you
interesting characters.

316
00:26:48,243 --> 00:26:52,868
In fact, I got interest into
people watching only after seeing them.

317
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,185
Look there.

318
00:27:02,535 --> 00:27:06,160
I think they are newly married, they came
to this apartment just two months back.

319
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:13,201
Newly married means they would
be romantic. Did you thus say interesting.

320
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,502
Hey, not so... Look there.

321
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:41,493
I think he is a big psycho.

322
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:45,785
He acts with love and
again shouts in anger.

323
00:27:46,701 --> 00:27:51,076
I do not understand at all
when they are happy and when they are sad.

324
00:27:51,576 --> 00:27:55,701
But, I feel very pity seeing that girl.

325
00:28:05,243 --> 00:28:08,993
I have kept the bed ready spreading
the sheet and jasmines, my dear.

326
00:28:12,084 --> 00:28:13,035
Hello Mr. Diamond.

327
00:28:14,618 --> 00:28:16,035
Hey, who are you dude?

328
00:28:16,243 --> 00:28:18,660
Though I am so cute,
do you call me Diamond?

329
00:28:18,826 --> 00:28:20,993
Diamond is not my name
but my characterization.

330
00:28:21,253 --> 00:28:22,236
Oh, your name then?

331
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,201
Pagadam Satyam.

332
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:23,993
Oh, nice name.

333
00:28:24,073 --> 00:28:27,026
Ok, your house is there
and what are doing here?

334
00:28:27,743 --> 00:28:28,777
Waste...

335
00:28:31,785 --> 00:28:35,910
As a citizen,
I wish to see India clean and healthy.

336
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:41,410
To live a healthy life, be clean
and stay away from the waste.

337
00:28:45,111 --> 00:28:49,903
Oh no, Suprabhatam early in the morning
and then are the whistles.

338
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,940
Oh no, aunty said to stop
the stove after one more whistle.

339
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,188
Never mind.

340
00:28:55,268 --> 00:28:56,712
That noise is bothering me.

341
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:00,444
Hi..

342
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,857
Hey, why did you directly
come and sit in the kitchen?

343
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:08,440
You texted to directly
come home in the night, correct?

344
00:29:08,524 --> 00:29:10,482
I slept at 3:30 chatting
with you whole night.

345
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,940
I woke up at 4:30.

346
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,357
Then, that message...

347
00:29:16,524 --> 00:29:18,024
I kept at 5.

348
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,399
Is it?
- What son?

349
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:23,774
Is it enough that they see you?
We too should see the girl right?

350
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:28,274
Ok dear, they said your leg fractured,
how is it now?

351
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,649
It is fine now uncle.

352
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,899
Ok, how do you know?

353
00:29:31,982 --> 00:29:32,815
I said.

354
00:29:34,134 --> 00:29:35,815
How?
- I saw in WhatsApp.

355
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:45,086
How did the accident take place dear?
- Actually...

356
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:48,815
When she was going on scooty, a
car came in wrong route and dashed hubby.

357
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,565
You should have pulled that fellow out
and given four shots.

358
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:51,440
Actually..

359
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:54,940
She wanted to hit, but it was her
maths teacher who did the accident.

360
00:29:56,189 --> 00:29:57,857
Baby is a bit weak in maths.

361
00:29:59,649 --> 00:30:01,024
It becomes a problem, right?

362
00:30:04,264 --> 00:30:05,482
Are you weak in maths?

363
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,690
My son is a King, he scores 100.

364
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:10,857
Daddy.

365
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:13,565
Go on son, you should say such things out.

366
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:15,335
Oh no.

367
00:30:25,498 --> 00:30:30,399
Look dear, how sweet is the sound in our
gramophone than in your city phone?

368
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:33,315
Have you again started
about your old songs?

369
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:34,982
You first have the breakfast.

370
00:30:35,482 --> 00:30:36,899
You first go and take your tablet.

371
00:30:37,107 --> 00:30:41,732
If you do not take tablet and eat food,
you get shivering and my BP goes high.

372
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:45,815
You do not buy when said to take big
table. Where do I sit, it is congested.

373
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:50,524
Why big table dear, we are just three.

374
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:54,399
Things above needs increased
the distance between humans.

375
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,417
But though congested,

376
00:30:56,497 --> 00:30:59,357
when we share the congestion
that happiness is different, right dear?

377
00:30:59,777 --> 00:31:01,010
What do you say?

378
00:31:09,524 --> 00:31:11,357
You are very cute and traditional.

379
00:31:11,607 --> 00:31:13,232
You are not any speed like I thought.

380
00:31:13,312 --> 00:31:14,149
Speed?

381
00:31:14,357 --> 00:31:16,815
Then, will we not think speed
when you give phone number without asking?

382
00:31:21,815 --> 00:31:25,065
You look to have read
the whole WhatsApp aunty.

383
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,899
I did not see this
in WhatsApp dear, he said.

384
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,357
Hey Jo,

385
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,410
why are you leaving without talking?
Say something.

386
00:31:51,732 --> 00:31:54,399
I anyways may have failed the test
and if you confirm a bit.

387
00:31:56,156 --> 00:31:58,977
Till yesterday,
I thought you may at least just pass.

388
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:01,399
Today after coming to your house..

389
00:32:02,065 --> 00:32:05,565
Hey hello, why are you
leaving in between when I am saying?

390
00:32:05,863 --> 00:32:06,774
You will anyways say no.

391
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,349
Falling behind and disturbing even after
saying no... I am not a guy like that.

392
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:11,649
My family is very decent.

393
00:32:12,524 --> 00:32:14,940
I passed you after
seeing that family right?

394
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:16,512
I too am saying the same.

395
00:32:18,774 --> 00:32:20,774
What? Hey, what did you say?

396
00:32:21,993 --> 00:32:23,399
You said something...

397
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:25,603
You said something.

398
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,532
That is..
-That is...

399
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:31,559
I...

400
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:32,597
I...

401
00:32:34,524 --> 00:32:35,527
Love..

402
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:37,138
Love.

403
00:32:40,036 --> 00:32:40,998
Hey Jo...

404
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:45,139
Jeeva...

405
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:47,732
My God... Blood is coming Jeeva.

406
00:32:47,983 --> 00:32:50,149
Leave that, but you were
saying something right? Say that.

407
00:32:50,857 --> 00:32:53,399
Are you any mad, when such
a big wound came on your hand?

408
00:32:54,357 --> 00:32:55,982
Wound on the hand would heal sometime.

409
00:32:56,065 --> 00:32:57,982
But, this day and this
moment will not come again.

410
00:32:58,649 --> 00:33:01,107
Oh no Jeeva, ok fine I love you.

411
00:33:01,232 --> 00:33:02,274
Give your hand once..
- Sure...?

412
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:05,774
Please Jeeva, show..
- Enough, enough Jo.

413
00:33:06,312 --> 00:33:09,690
You accepted my love.
I cannot forget this day in my life.

414
00:33:15,296 --> 00:33:17,274
I want to forget this day in my life

415
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,149
A man can never forget, sir.

416
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:22,982
Hi, sir, introducing myself.

417
00:33:23,732 --> 00:33:24,657
Raghavendra Rao...

418
00:33:24,857 --> 00:33:26,357
Dasari Raghavendra Rao, MA.

419
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,315
I am full time customer
to this bar and part time waiter.

420
00:33:31,774 --> 00:33:33,732
Hey KM, customer is calling there.

421
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:37,024
Hey Black Dog...
I am not a waiter now but a customer, go.

422
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,732
Sir, drink I take in a day
and you finished in half an hour, sir.

423
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,982
Pain dude, I should forget right?

424
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:47,732
Sir, you drink and forget the pain
but do not forget the bill.

425
00:33:47,815 --> 00:33:49,232
I will have to forget this bar again.

426
00:33:49,857 --> 00:33:52,190
You know the reason for
all pains in the life of boys?

427
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:53,975
Love.

428
00:35:03,888 --> 00:35:06,612
What is this fellow,
always seen holding the waste?

429
00:35:11,482 --> 00:35:12,320
Nasty...

430
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:24,399
One...

431
00:35:25,304 --> 00:35:26,107
Two...

432
00:35:29,732 --> 00:35:32,107
My dear Diamond...
- No, Pagadam Sathyam.

433
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,357
Hey, you...

434
00:35:35,607 --> 00:35:37,854
Why are you moving
with waste in the pockets?

435
00:35:38,899 --> 00:35:40,940
Oh, that one, sir... As a citizen, I...

436
00:35:42,732 --> 00:35:43,899
My sister said in advance sir that

437
00:35:43,982 --> 00:35:45,357
there will not be believability when
spoken in Telugu

438
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:46,611
and thus to speak in English

439
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:47,815
and I will try for you, ok?

440
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:53,357
See bro, according to statistics of India
dust is the major cause of backwardness.

441
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,274
Telugu medium?

442
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,253
He is seen..

443
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,440
What is this idiot?

444
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,190
Hey, what a miracle?

445
00:36:06,274 --> 00:36:08,399
Bro, your hand looks to be a Mega hand.

446
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,944
Even garbage turned into
gold chain when you touched.

447
00:36:11,024 --> 00:36:13,024
Test or my foot...
Say the truth rogue.

448
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,607
Sir, whatever I say scene may get lagged
but I understood you will not leave me.

449
00:36:19,216 --> 00:36:21,258
I am a thief, sir.

450
00:36:22,076 --> 00:36:22,841
Theft at home.

451
00:36:24,378 --> 00:36:25,077
Yes, sir.

452
00:36:25,157 --> 00:36:26,966
Like work at home, it is theft at home.

453
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,216
Why only software should have that option?
Should we thieves not have that?

454
00:36:30,296 --> 00:36:32,803
Thus I paid 50000 advance
in this apartments,

455
00:36:32,883 --> 00:36:35,466
paying 25000 rent per month
and am looting twice a day.

456
00:36:36,638 --> 00:36:38,008
Then, why is that Pink tissue?

457
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:41,216
Oh, that is an example of my brain.

458
00:36:41,428 --> 00:36:44,970
Sir, all chains I loot will be kept in
these tissues, thrown in dustbin,

459
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:48,141
next day I collect on the name of Swatch
Bharat and enjoy separating coming here.

460
00:36:48,221 --> 00:36:51,979
It is ok but if you do not everything
you looted back to them,

461
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:54,425
not theft at home but
you will have bash up at jail.

462
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:55,987
Understood?
- Ok, sir.

463
00:36:56,067 --> 00:36:56,758
Go...

464
00:36:56,993 --> 00:36:58,758
Hey, come.

465
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,758
Understood, sir.

466
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:02,975
As you may lose if in your pocket,

467
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,675
I put it in tissue and
robbed as a regular habit.

468
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,484
Bye.

469
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:10,993
Thanks bro.

470
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:12,474
Bro?

471
00:37:12,554 --> 00:37:13,591
For saying okay.

472
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:15,317
Did I say ok? Me...

473
00:37:15,397 --> 00:37:16,258
Me...
- Daddy.

474
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:19,341
It is ok for you if Mom says ok right?

475
00:37:20,312 --> 00:37:24,550
What ok for mummy?
You know, I said ok first?

476
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:28,883
I said Ok first bro...

477
00:37:31,925 --> 00:37:33,050
Bye.
- Bye.

478
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:34,616
Bye.
- Bye.

479
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,216
Hey coffee.

480
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:37,708
Coffee?

481
00:37:38,313 --> 00:37:39,841
Sister just gave coffee right?

482
00:37:40,941 --> 00:37:41,966
You did not give right?

483
00:37:46,091 --> 00:37:49,091
You asked one coffee
and had around four till now.

484
00:37:49,425 --> 00:37:51,550
Enough now, start Jeeva.

485
00:37:51,881 --> 00:37:54,008
I will start, but close your eyes once.

486
00:37:54,184 --> 00:37:55,841
Oh no, I will not believe you.

487
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:07,966
Jeeva, something happened.

488
00:38:08,628 --> 00:38:09,758
Call for Ambulance.

489
00:38:10,012 --> 00:38:11,245
Jo, relax.

490
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:15,655
He hit and left, we shall call Ambulance.

491
00:38:15,735 --> 00:38:18,258
Where is the phone?
- Jo, calm down.

492
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:23,731
There, she is getting up.
She is fine.

493
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,860
Thank God.

494
00:38:33,924 --> 00:38:38,091
He is psycho hit today
and would kill tomorrow.

495
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:40,386
Let us give a Police complaint Jeeva.

496
00:38:40,466 --> 00:38:41,675
Jo, this is a wife and husband issue.

497
00:38:42,259 --> 00:38:44,800
It is very sensitive and not correct even
for parents to involve

498
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,335
and why do you say
to give a Police complaint?

499
00:38:46,415 --> 00:38:50,681
You mean to sit calm closing the
curtain even if he kills her right?

500
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,383
Not that, I am saying we shall find out
what happened in between them.

501
00:38:57,841 --> 00:39:02,300
Jo, that is a matter of two hearts and
it is not correct to estimate from far.

502
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,125
Give me time for two days

503
00:39:04,205 --> 00:39:05,675
and we shall find out
what happened in between those two.

504
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,591
We shall then decide what to do, ok?

505
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:41,451
Hello.
- Jo.

506
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,258
Are you following, where is that fellow?

507
00:39:43,472 --> 00:39:44,121
You...

508
00:39:44,201 --> 00:39:45,310
He, went into the psychiatric clinic

509
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,050
I said he is a big psycho right?

510
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,633
Jo, I will call again. Cut the phone.

511
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,466
Drink, eat and enjoy.

512
00:40:14,802 --> 00:40:15,800
Give the bill to me.

513
00:40:16,294 --> 00:40:18,716
But whatever you do is before 11 PM.

514
00:40:18,965 --> 00:40:21,341
Because I cannot pay the bill after 12.

515
00:40:21,538 --> 00:40:25,008
Why, is any new tax adding like GST?

516
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:27,133
Suicide...

517
00:40:28,036 --> 00:40:28,841
What, suicide?

518
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:34,383
What message should we
give to this society being alive?

519
00:40:34,663 --> 00:40:39,091
This suicide is bad, ugly and worst.

520
00:40:39,927 --> 00:40:41,675
Still, why only for this great time?

521
00:40:42,008 --> 00:40:44,716
Brother, no girl is marrying me.

522
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:46,800
You look to be very innocent, bro.

523
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:50,550
You should celebrate if not marrying,
but will anyone die?

524
00:40:51,463 --> 00:40:55,508
Marriage is a hell,
marriage is a dirty thing.

525
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:59,841
It is like life of a man is gone to dogs
if he gets married, bro.

526
00:41:01,074 --> 00:41:03,925
Hey, who said marriage is a hell idiot?

527
00:41:06,718 --> 00:41:11,383
Love means not always happiness but you
will have pain and sorrows at times too.

528
00:41:11,691 --> 00:41:13,091
Word reached to the target.

529
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:17,675
Brother, you are getting so emotional
means we both shall sit face to face.

530
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,716
I think you got married.

531
00:41:23,486 --> 00:41:24,300
Yes.

532
00:41:25,335 --> 00:41:26,508
Arranged or love?

533
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:29,258
Love marriage.
- Oh, love?

534
00:41:29,675 --> 00:41:30,643
I cannot believe.

535
00:41:30,723 --> 00:41:32,591
Why, should mine not be a love marriage?

536
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:35,758
It can be, will you tell your story?

537
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:37,425
Why?

538
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:41,951
To get inspired by you and
your love story to forget my pain.

539
00:41:42,031 --> 00:41:44,675
Sir, will you cancel your suicide
program by chance or what?

540
00:41:44,758 --> 00:41:45,713
We all may have to feel very bad again.

541
00:41:45,793 --> 00:41:46,550
Oh no!

542
00:41:46,633 --> 00:41:47,966
I am not a waiter now, sir. Oh no.

543
00:41:48,046 --> 00:41:49,443
Hello..

544
00:41:49,962 --> 00:41:52,841
I understood,
no dialogues for me in this scene.

545
00:41:53,184 --> 00:41:54,425
Can I?
- You, get aside

546
00:41:54,883 --> 00:41:55,804
Thank you.

547
00:41:56,539 --> 00:41:57,550
You say, brother.

548
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:00,008
One year back.

549
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:02,800
Inorbit mall.

550
00:42:04,464 --> 00:42:05,300
Inorbit mall?

551
00:42:06,907 --> 00:42:08,841
All love stories used
to start then in the temple.

552
00:42:09,513 --> 00:42:10,720
And trend is changed now.

553
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,716
Ok, at Inorbit mall...

554
00:42:12,183 --> 00:42:13,275
Basement...

555
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:15,841
Basement?

556
00:42:18,509 --> 00:42:21,383
I went to mall with parents
but had no mood to shop.

557
00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:25,216
I was sitting in the car back seat
and playing game in the mobile...

558
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:30,633
White Audi car beside my vehicle,
number 7777.

559
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,633
I was watching as it was reversing.

560
00:42:33,363 --> 00:42:34,675
A duster beside

561
00:42:35,688 --> 00:42:37,136
number was not seen...

562
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,716
In the back seat, it was Swathi,

563
00:42:41,828 --> 00:42:42,633
my love.

564
00:42:42,909 --> 00:42:43,883
Inorbit mall...

565
00:42:44,693 --> 00:42:45,828
Basement

566
00:42:46,627 --> 00:42:47,591
and girl in the back seat.

567
00:42:49,979 --> 00:42:51,352
He is saying my love story to me.

568
00:42:51,432 --> 00:42:52,595
Ok, next.

569
00:42:52,822 --> 00:42:55,383
I immediately saw that girl and whistled.

570
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,386
Whistle.

571
00:42:57,466 --> 00:42:58,758
You must have whistled twice, right?

572
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:05,466
Ok, say next.

573
00:43:06,337 --> 00:43:09,966
But, some guy by then
came with blood in between.

574
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:12,175
Some people came to hit him too.

575
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,438
You immediately got down and saved him.

576
00:43:13,518 --> 00:43:14,175
Yes.

577
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,217
I mean, not to show heroism.

578
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,592
Our character itself is so..

579
00:43:18,675 --> 00:43:21,217
Oh no, even my character is similar.
Say what next.

580
00:43:22,175 --> 00:43:25,671
By the time I thought to try
and make her flat, car went in reverse.

581
00:43:26,134 --> 00:43:32,340
By the time I thought she was leaving, she
said stop and got down and my BP raised.

582
00:43:32,832 --> 00:43:33,724
It will.

583
00:43:33,925 --> 00:43:38,069
When she got down from the car
and was coming towards me.

584
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,868
Her right ankle was fractured right?

585
00:43:40,788 --> 00:43:42,050
Yes, exactly.

586
00:43:42,837 --> 00:43:45,592
My love story started so, bro.

587
00:43:46,384 --> 00:43:48,717
It would have been better if
I went that day for shopping.

588
00:43:48,884 --> 00:43:53,092
I had no need now today to drink so.

589
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:56,300
You said my love story to me
and what a performance you gave.

590
00:43:57,091 --> 00:43:57,907
Jo..

591
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,131
What?

592
00:43:59,284 --> 00:44:02,259
Are you all friends?
Do you all wish to get along and fool me?

593
00:44:03,009 --> 00:44:03,483
What?

594
00:44:03,563 --> 00:44:04,300
Why do you say what again?

595
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:06,925
Inorbit mall,
Basement, B57 and right ankle.

596
00:44:07,009 --> 00:44:09,054
How will he say like everything happened
to him which happened to us?

597
00:44:09,134 --> 00:44:10,717
Yes, how is he saying?

598
00:44:11,384 --> 00:44:12,429
Is he saying it all without you said?

599
00:44:12,509 --> 00:44:13,634
When did I say?

600
00:44:13,813 --> 00:44:16,967
You did not say, I did not say and how
is saying it all like he say from close?

601
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,759
Yes, how is he saying?

602
00:44:20,717 --> 00:44:23,525
By chance, is he following us both?

603
00:44:23,759 --> 00:44:25,175
Why will he follow us?

604
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:29,579
Yes, not us but you.
You think he is following you?

605
00:44:30,342 --> 00:44:31,425
Why will he follow me?

606
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:35,342
Jo, what we need now
are not questions but answers.

607
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,800
Answers Jo.

608
00:44:37,543 --> 00:44:38,325
Correct.

609
00:44:39,315 --> 00:44:41,750
Then, what to do for getting the answers?

610
00:44:43,967 --> 00:44:46,116
I will find out, I will.

611
00:44:48,676 --> 00:44:49,485
Let's go.

612
00:45:13,842 --> 00:45:14,509
What happened?

613
00:45:15,607 --> 00:45:16,334
See.

614
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,800
See the photo beside that dining table.

615
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:25,092
So what?

616
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,342
Photo taken when I saw you
first time in the parking lot.

617
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,217
I did not even show you till now.

618
00:45:39,384 --> 00:45:46,595
Then, is that photo taken
when Srinivas saw the girl first time?

619
00:45:47,765 --> 00:45:50,092
Is what he said true?

620
00:46:00,745 --> 00:46:01,717
Hello Boss,

621
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,091
what boss you said the story till titles
sequence and stopped?

622
00:46:06,274 --> 00:46:07,012
What happened next?

623
00:46:07,092 --> 00:46:08,300
Hello, who are you?

624
00:46:09,954 --> 00:46:10,800
Who are you...

625
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:13,587
Looks like you took me for someone,
no problem.

626
00:46:14,341 --> 00:46:16,610
Oh, then there is another guy even in you.

627
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,175
I know when he comes out

628
00:46:18,665 --> 00:46:19,970
I will make him say the balance story.

629
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,703
He will say it, he will.

630
00:46:24,104 --> 00:46:25,384
Till where did I say, brother?

631
00:46:25,772 --> 00:46:27,887
Basement at Inorbit,
Car in the basement and girl in car.

632
00:46:27,967 --> 00:46:28,550
Ok...

633
00:47:08,509 --> 00:47:09,397
Why bro?

634
00:47:10,089 --> 00:47:11,398
She wouldn't not have
sat in the car without moving

635
00:47:11,478 --> 00:47:12,759
if she was not fractured right!

636
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:15,300
Then i would not have met her at B 57.

637
00:47:15,854 --> 00:47:16,712
B 57..!

638
00:47:17,044 --> 00:47:20,092
Yes, bro...B 57..!

639
00:47:59,553 --> 00:48:00,967
I also bought an ice cream to him.

640
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:06,203
Damn, we lovers are having to invest
on side characters in every love story.

641
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:10,259
It may sound cheap to say

642
00:48:10,759 --> 00:48:16,509
but I lifted her band aid from the dustbin
without anyone seeing after she left

643
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:23,054
Wow, this is not any ordinary love
for humans to understand.

644
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:25,634
Pure like the fire.

645
00:49:32,507 --> 00:49:34,550
Now I am going mad.

646
00:50:09,128 --> 00:50:11,384
Then, when she proposed?

647
00:50:18,217 --> 00:50:19,092
I think...

648
00:50:19,634 --> 00:50:20,967
Ok, you think...

649
00:50:23,175 --> 00:50:24,634
I Love...

650
00:50:27,675 --> 00:50:28,514
Hey Swathi...

651
00:50:34,081 --> 00:50:37,232
She called the next day
and asked to visit her house.

652
00:50:38,124 --> 00:50:39,536
I was super excited when I went there.

653
00:50:55,691 --> 00:50:56,417
How am I?

654
00:50:58,002 --> 00:51:00,566
Hello...How am I?

655
00:51:01,275 --> 00:51:02,775
You look like double meaning for beauty.

656
00:51:06,024 --> 00:51:08,191
When all meanings of
beauty are seen in sari,

657
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:12,274
why do these wear such meaningless dress
and move around brother?

658
00:51:12,899 --> 00:51:13,983
Why not wear sari daily?

659
00:51:14,146 --> 00:51:16,441
They will wear, but why did she call?

660
00:51:16,886 --> 00:51:17,441
Treat.

661
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:18,899
Treat?

662
00:51:18,979 --> 00:51:20,191
Yes, visual treat

663
00:51:37,191 --> 00:51:38,899
Did you call just to show?

664
00:51:39,795 --> 00:51:40,649
Will you drink milk?

665
00:51:41,733 --> 00:51:42,358
Milk?

666
00:51:43,524 --> 00:51:45,691
No habit, maybe I get nausea.

667
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:48,274
An almond milk, I prepared.

668
00:51:48,608 --> 00:51:50,483
Oh, an almond milk.

669
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:52,149
Okay.

670
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:55,399
What to give an almond milk bro,
should give full meals right?

671
00:51:55,585 --> 00:51:59,178
Brother, it is great for
her to call home and give an almond milk

672
00:51:59,258 --> 00:52:01,569
and full meals would not be good.

673
00:52:01,649 --> 00:52:02,858
First listen to what I say.

674
00:52:14,418 --> 00:52:16,608
Oh no, power is gone in my house.

675
00:52:18,154 --> 00:52:19,233
It came into my body.

676
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:21,816
Shall we go to lawn?

677
00:52:22,066 --> 00:52:23,774
In, why inside?

678
00:52:24,396 --> 00:52:27,164
Not inside but lawn.

679
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:28,333
Lawn?

680
00:52:40,945 --> 00:52:44,827
In the shade of full moonlight
and with the cool breeze...

681
00:52:45,543 --> 00:52:50,460
Good time when eyes met, getting closer.

682
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,196
Getting closer...

683
00:52:52,604 --> 00:52:53,614
Hey, brother...

684
00:52:56,608 --> 00:52:57,733
Say what happened next, brother?

685
00:52:58,442 --> 00:53:01,567
Then, for the first time in my life.

686
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:02,817
For the first time?

687
00:53:05,567 --> 00:53:06,775
Hey brother, say properly...

688
00:53:10,988 --> 00:53:12,400
Hello...
- Jeeva. - Jo.

689
00:53:12,545 --> 00:53:13,192
Where are you?

690
00:53:13,272 --> 00:53:14,820
I am at the edge for a matter.

691
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,317
What?
- Nothing, say what?

692
00:53:16,397 --> 00:53:17,192
Come to the flat once.

693
00:53:17,533 --> 00:53:18,692
Flat, why?

694
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,775
You come first and I will say.

695
00:53:20,176 --> 00:53:20,861
Okay, I will come.

696
00:53:21,006 --> 00:53:23,695
Brother, we will talk later. Ok, see you.

697
00:53:23,775 --> 00:53:25,358
Bye, all the best.

698
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:49,942
How am I?

699
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:52,292
Hey, you asked the same.

700
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:55,358
What?
- I mean, you look great.

701
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:57,358
How is the sari?

702
00:53:58,849 --> 00:53:59,878
It is surprising.

703
00:54:00,275 --> 00:54:00,985
What?

704
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:05,025
I mean, you always wear short dresses
and you are in sari strangely.

705
00:54:05,872 --> 00:54:08,692
Oh, thought to show you. Is it good?

706
00:54:11,067 --> 00:54:11,909
Good.

707
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,358
Will you give milk?

708
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:43,233
I mean, you may have
prepared an almond milk.

709
00:54:43,483 --> 00:54:47,198
Oh, an almond milk?
Wait, I will bring.

710
00:54:58,317 --> 00:55:01,441
Yes, how do you know
that I made an almond milk?

711
00:55:02,582 --> 00:55:04,775
I mean, Srinivas informed.

712
00:55:05,566 --> 00:55:06,650
How do Srinivas know?

713
00:55:07,233 --> 00:55:11,525
He said past till date
and said the future now.

714
00:55:11,858 --> 00:55:12,840
What did he say?

715
00:55:13,983 --> 00:55:18,565
That is... In between us... will happen...

716
00:55:20,433 --> 00:55:25,400
I mean...
Ding dong bell, get down on the well.

717
00:55:25,821 --> 00:55:30,400
Ding dong bell... Damn...
no, I did not call for that.

718
00:55:30,604 --> 00:55:33,567
I mean, everything happened
as he said till now.

719
00:55:33,733 --> 00:55:37,775
Your sari, an almond milk and you know
power goes when you are giving milk.

720
00:55:38,025 --> 00:55:38,838
I see.

721
00:55:40,858 --> 00:55:42,418
Take, let us see.

722
00:55:48,983 --> 00:55:51,233
Oh no, even the power is gone.

723
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,567
All is happening as he said.

724
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:58,442
Then, now even that...
It will happen.

725
00:56:01,997 --> 00:56:06,313
Then, even for them before marriage...
- Yes.

726
00:56:06,942 --> 00:56:08,121
No way to skip.

727
00:56:08,718 --> 00:56:09,851
Looks like no way.

728
00:56:28,289 --> 00:56:29,192
No, why did the current come?

729
00:56:30,106 --> 00:56:30,900
Srinivas did not say

730
00:56:30,983 --> 00:56:31,650
Hey Jo.

731
00:56:32,483 --> 00:56:35,400
Are you in the flat?
I am getting bored, wait I am coming.

732
00:56:36,065 --> 00:56:39,025
Hey Jeeva, go please. - Who
is this character? Srinivas did not say.

733
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:40,900
Will you send me away if she comes?
- Please go Jeeva.

734
00:56:41,487 --> 00:56:42,858
Hey Jo please.
- Go.

735
00:56:44,982 --> 00:56:45,900
Bye.

736
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:52,097
Idiot, where is this fellow
saying good times when eyes met.

737
00:56:52,877 --> 00:56:53,737
Where?

738
00:56:53,817 --> 00:56:56,817
In the swimming fun...

739
00:56:56,983 --> 00:56:59,775
Hey, you said good time when eyes met and
something happening for the first time.

740
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:02,537
Hey, what happened for first time, what?

741
00:57:02,617 --> 00:57:05,025
For the first time ever...
- First time ever.

742
00:57:05,317 --> 00:57:06,442
That girl.

743
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:11,099
She kissed, brother.
- Kiss... You.

744
00:57:11,567 --> 00:57:13,108
You gave a buildup like
hitting century in single ball.

745
00:57:13,442 --> 00:57:15,942
What a pleasure dear?

746
00:57:16,211 --> 00:57:18,150
Kiss it seems,
I do not have even that idiot.

747
00:57:46,025 --> 00:57:47,029
Jo.

748
00:57:49,044 --> 00:57:50,942
Jo, you said to come so urgently.
What is the matter?

749
00:57:51,022 --> 00:57:53,400
I said then to give a Police complaint.

750
00:57:53,858 --> 00:57:54,942
See what happened now.

751
00:57:55,401 --> 00:57:56,150
What happened?

752
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,653
I saw him taking Swathi
somewhere today morning.

753
00:57:58,733 --> 00:58:00,330
She was unconscious.

754
00:58:04,811 --> 00:58:06,108
What would have that Psycho done?

755
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:08,608
We could not do anything though observing.

756
00:58:09,192 --> 00:58:11,400
It is all because of you. You are...
- What is the flat number?

757
00:58:11,817 --> 00:58:12,863
What?

758
00:58:13,317 --> 00:58:14,733
What is the flat number of Swathi?

759
00:58:16,669 --> 00:58:17,741
Let's go.

760
00:58:22,498 --> 00:58:23,775
Why is the door open?

761
00:58:52,928 --> 00:58:55,150
Swathi was unconscious
by the time Srinivas came home.

762
00:58:55,471 --> 00:58:56,775
This medicine box is empty.

763
00:58:57,275 --> 00:58:59,442
Maybe he would have taken her to hospital
thinking she committed suicide.

764
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:05,025
Maybe, but why did she commit suicide?

765
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,775
It is because he is a big psycho right?

766
00:59:07,025 --> 00:59:11,733
He is moving around the psychiatric
clinics and bars as he is a big psycho.

767
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:16,150
Such mental candidates should not be here,
but in mental hospitals.

768
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:17,608
They should not be let out at all.

769
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:21,771
Jo,

770
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,233
mental issue is not for Srinivas.

771
00:59:25,109 --> 00:59:25,650
What?

772
00:59:26,442 --> 00:59:27,445
For Swathi.

773
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,475
What?

774
00:59:32,692 --> 00:59:33,650
Here, see.

775
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:41,233
Medical issue of Swathi is PTSD,
post traumatic stress disorder.

776
00:59:42,114 --> 00:59:45,979
Anxiety, depression, hallucination,
fearing of seeing nightmares,

777
00:59:46,273 --> 00:59:49,275
physical violence,
behaving mad losing control...

778
00:59:49,507 --> 00:59:51,067
these are the symptoms.

779
00:59:54,567 --> 00:59:56,650
Even the truth looks
as a lie seeing from far, Jo.

780
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:00,775
But truth or lie is known
only when seen from near.

781
01:00:04,194 --> 01:00:08,067
Jo... Jo, what happened?

782
01:00:08,951 --> 01:00:10,344
Weising till 8 years,

783
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:13,400
tonsils operation at the age of 13,

784
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:16,733
right ankle fracture at 22...

785
01:00:17,442 --> 01:00:20,650
It is in that report that
all these happened to Swathi

786
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:27,608
I thought what took place in their life
is happening only from B57 in our life.

787
01:00:28,061 --> 01:00:32,108
But, by birth life of us both is same.

788
01:00:36,858 --> 01:00:37,650
Yes Jeeva,

789
01:00:38,233 --> 01:00:41,736
everything that happened to
Swathi from that Medical report happened

790
01:00:41,816 --> 01:00:43,108
even in my life.

791
01:00:47,046 --> 01:00:50,733
That means,
is my future too going to be the same?

792
01:00:51,525 --> 01:00:53,858
Will you too come drunk daily and hit me?

793
01:00:54,085 --> 01:00:55,025
Why will I hit?

794
01:00:55,817 --> 01:00:58,233
Will I too become a mental patient?

795
01:00:58,452 --> 01:01:00,192
Jo.
- No Jeeva..

796
01:01:01,067 --> 01:01:01,983
I do not want such a life.

797
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:07,150
I do not know who they are at all.
There is no relation to us with them.

798
01:01:07,775 --> 01:01:12,150
But, what is this happening in our life
like from their life, Jeeva?

799
01:01:13,025 --> 01:01:14,900
How Jeeva, how is that?

800
01:01:41,944 --> 01:01:43,177
He's an Indian physicist who
did research about parallel life.

801
01:01:43,257 --> 01:01:45,110
He's an Indian physicist who
did research about parallel life.

802
01:01:45,905 --> 01:01:47,730
He may help us find a solution.

803
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:18,733
Incidents do happen in general like they
happened in life of someone else.

804
01:02:19,067 --> 01:02:22,115
They can be thought of as coincidence
if they are one or two.

805
01:02:22,195 --> 01:02:24,858
But when all are happening so...

806
01:02:27,348 --> 01:02:29,025
That is called parallel life.

807
01:02:29,865 --> 01:02:32,494
Sir, does this parallel life really exist?

808
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:37,108
Considering our history,
epics and ancient stories.

809
01:02:37,608 --> 01:02:41,983
there are many examples about rebirths,
relation from various births.

810
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:48,983
A continuous research is on at Delhi
anthropology center based on those.

811
01:02:49,983 --> 01:02:56,400
When data collected from hundreds of years
based on history and historians,

812
01:02:56,775 --> 01:02:59,942
truths they faced are very shocking.

813
01:03:01,067 --> 01:03:02,983
One from those is parallel life.

814
01:03:05,525 --> 01:03:08,775
Do you know the relation between
Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy?

815
01:03:12,233 --> 01:03:16,192
Abraham Lincoln and
John F Kennedy are from the same country.

816
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:18,733
There is a gap of 100
years in between the two.

817
01:03:19,442 --> 01:03:23,275
But seeing what happened in the
lives of these two, it is shocking.

818
01:03:24,483 --> 01:03:30,233
Abraham Lincoln was elected
to Congress in 1846 and Kennedy in 1946.

819
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:35,983
Lincoln became the President
of America in 1860 and Kennedy in 1960.

820
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,022
Name of Secretary for Lincoln was Kennedy

821
01:03:39,102 --> 01:03:40,983
and name of secretary
for Kennedy was Lincoln.

822
01:03:42,733 --> 01:03:45,266
Lincoln was killed
shooting in Ford Theater

823
01:03:45,346 --> 01:03:47,483
and Kennedy was killed shot in Ford car.

824
01:03:47,961 --> 01:03:53,233
When shot wife was adjacent to Lincoln
and even beside Kennedy was his wife.

825
01:03:53,733 --> 01:03:56,317
Life of those both went almost the same.

826
01:03:59,233 --> 01:04:00,817
This is just an example and...

827
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:06,849
Her name is Mary and
even her name too is Mary.

828
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:10,067
There is a gap of 157
years in between these two.

829
01:04:10,567 --> 01:04:12,983
Their names are same
date of births are same.

830
01:04:14,027 --> 01:04:16,082
When the first lady wearing new dress

831
01:04:16,162 --> 01:04:19,358
was going to watch a dance
along with her friend, was murdered.

832
01:04:19,483 --> 01:04:21,608
Even the second lady was murdered the same

833
01:04:22,241 --> 01:04:25,483
Place and even the date
both were murdered are the same.

834
01:04:26,685 --> 01:04:32,025
Not just that, names of those
who murdered both is the same.

835
01:04:35,025 --> 01:04:38,817
Maybe parallel life is on
in our lives and our surroundings.

836
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:44,025
But when we know and compare them,
they are felt surprising.

837
01:04:44,733 --> 01:04:47,775
Lives of both the same...
How is it possible, sir?

838
01:04:50,083 --> 01:04:51,283
One second..

839
01:04:59,525 --> 01:05:01,817
I threw these match sticks just randomly.

840
01:05:02,525 --> 01:05:05,567
We feel that each stick
fell in different direction.

841
01:05:07,233 --> 01:05:09,900
But, now observe carefully.

842
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:32,233
Only these two sticks...
- Fell parallel

843
01:05:33,073 --> 01:05:34,317
Yes, you are right.

844
01:05:35,233 --> 01:05:40,067
When thrown without planning, when
two sticks fell parallel from a few sticks

845
01:05:40,672 --> 01:05:45,692
think how many lives can be parallel in
so many crores of people

846
01:05:48,574 --> 01:05:50,442
Seeing your situation now,

847
01:05:52,775 --> 01:05:58,025
if this stick is their
life this stick is your life.

848
01:06:01,233 --> 01:06:05,900
What happened in their life will
definitely happen even in your life.

849
01:06:06,983 --> 01:06:09,900
Their present is your future.

850
01:06:14,748 --> 01:06:17,483
Any remedies to avoid from such happening.

851
01:06:19,879 --> 01:06:22,731
Either do worship or ties dollars,

852
01:06:22,811 --> 01:06:26,608
this is not horoscope to
say your lives would change...

853
01:06:27,198 --> 01:06:29,275
...but a science and true.

854
01:06:30,108 --> 01:06:31,983
It will definitely happen.

855
01:06:35,942 --> 01:06:39,733
If you say no and cannot happen
and interfere to change the destiny

856
01:06:40,733 --> 01:06:43,983
in between incidents to
happen later too would come in front.

857
01:06:44,971 --> 01:06:48,108
But we cannot change the end results.

858
01:06:49,692 --> 01:06:53,275
Whatever happens to
her will happen to you.

859
01:07:17,165 --> 01:07:18,592
Jo...

860
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:20,722
Are you ok?

861
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:24,592
No...

862
01:08:47,525 --> 01:08:48,873
Jeeva...

863
01:08:59,414 --> 01:09:01,525
Swathi is dead Jeeva.

864
01:09:05,371 --> 01:09:07,983
That means... that means even I...

865
01:09:09,361 --> 01:09:10,608
Will I too die?

866
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:12,858
Jo, it will never happen so.

867
01:09:13,108 --> 01:09:15,775
I will die Jeeva, I too will die.

868
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:17,983
Jo, nothing will happen so for you.

869
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:22,942
No Jeeva, weising, tonsils operation,

870
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,766
right ankle fracture,

871
01:09:25,317 --> 01:09:28,358
B57 and everything happened the same.

872
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:30,567
And even death now?

873
01:09:31,275 --> 01:09:33,442
Body is right here, Ambulance just came
and they are taking it seems.

874
01:09:33,826 --> 01:09:35,692
Swathi...
- Wait a minute in line.

875
01:09:35,772 --> 01:09:37,108
All this... how?

876
01:09:37,317 --> 01:09:38,858
She was fine even when
she was going to hospital right?

877
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,900
She was fine even while
bringing back from hospital.

878
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:42,525
But after coming back home...

879
01:09:43,306 --> 01:09:44,445
After coming back?

880
01:09:44,525 --> 01:09:45,442
Someone killed it seems.

881
01:09:50,278 --> 01:09:51,694
I will find more details.

882
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,575
Yes, say... Right here.

883
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:02,525
Then, then will I too be killed?

884
01:10:02,895 --> 01:10:04,900
Jo, it will never happen so.

885
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:09,525
No Jeeva, Swathi was killed
and that means they will kill me too.

886
01:10:09,817 --> 01:10:11,567
Jo, nothing will happen when I am here.

887
01:10:11,858 --> 01:10:13,619
I will safeguard you.

888
01:10:13,699 --> 01:10:14,525
He killed.

889
01:10:19,733 --> 01:10:21,192
Did he kill Swathi?

890
01:10:36,525 --> 01:10:40,233
Whatever happens to
her will happen to you.

891
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:52,192
Hey... What is Srinivas killing?

892
01:10:54,775 --> 01:10:57,567
I know right,
he would have not killed. You...

893
01:10:57,781 --> 01:11:00,108
I killed... I killed...

894
01:11:00,526 --> 01:11:02,213
I killed with my own hands.

895
01:11:44,873 --> 01:11:48,714
A rogue named Srinivas in an apartment
at banjarahills

896
01:11:48,794 --> 01:11:51,614
killed his wife cutting her neck.

897
01:11:52,343 --> 01:11:56,406
Police knowing this immediately
have arrested Srinivas.

898
01:11:56,689 --> 01:11:58,406
They sent the body for post-mortem.

899
01:11:58,635 --> 01:12:02,114
It is to be enquired as to why he killed.

900
01:12:02,364 --> 01:12:04,614
Information is that they are
hardly married from less than a year

901
01:12:04,698 --> 01:12:07,031
and their is a love marriage.

902
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:10,114
Jo... Open the door.

903
01:12:12,008 --> 01:12:13,543
Jo, please listen to me.

904
01:12:17,305 --> 01:12:18,448
Still, why will I so...

905
01:12:20,156 --> 01:12:22,775
Just listen once,
please Jo.

906
01:12:30,114 --> 01:12:31,864
She pushed this fellow
out even before the marriage.

907
01:12:32,678 --> 01:12:37,198
Still, to have a talent like
me to handle wife is difficult, bro.

908
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:40,548
Ok, what happened, bro?

909
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:43,489
Do you know the relation between
Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy?

910
01:12:43,931 --> 01:12:45,906
Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy?

911
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,444
'Oh no, I shouldn't have
agreed to help him.'

912
01:12:51,952 --> 01:12:55,743
Jo... You are killing right?

913
01:12:55,823 --> 01:12:57,121
I will kill you.

914
01:12:57,864 --> 01:12:58,618
I don't leave you.

915
01:12:58,698 --> 01:13:02,428
Help if there is a chance else sit silent.
But, do not behave mad like this.

916
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:10,114
Jo, listen to me.

917
01:13:10,406 --> 01:13:12,614
Parallel life may be true,
all may have happened.

918
01:13:12,906 --> 01:13:15,281
Srinivas and Swathi do not
know about parallel life and we know.

919
01:13:15,573 --> 01:13:17,781
They do not know what is
happening in their life and we know.

920
01:13:18,406 --> 01:13:19,282
Why do only we know?

921
01:13:19,489 --> 01:13:21,989
Jo, there would be some reason for that.

922
01:13:22,763 --> 01:13:26,239
Similarly, there would definitely be some
process to change the fate too.

923
01:13:27,781 --> 01:13:29,281
We cannot believe a lie as it is good

924
01:13:30,298 --> 01:13:31,823
and cannot change the
truth as it is not good.

925
01:13:32,406 --> 01:13:33,369
This too is the same

926
01:13:35,455 --> 01:13:36,614
We cannot change the fate Jeeva.

927
01:13:37,606 --> 01:13:38,823
We cannot change the destiny.

928
01:13:42,614 --> 01:13:44,948
So please, do not disturb me.

929
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:48,073
Jo, please stop.

930
01:13:48,494 --> 01:13:50,295
Leave me alone.
- Jo.

931
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:50,948
Hey, stop it

932
01:13:51,028 --> 01:13:53,614
Jo, why do you not understand?
- Hello, brother.

933
01:13:57,448 --> 01:14:00,864
Are you asking a girl to understand?
They will not understand, brother.

934
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:03,868
We should say like they
understand and I will tell, ok?

935
01:14:10,198 --> 01:14:13,406
You come, we shall go to my house.
If not, let us do in the car itself.

936
01:14:14,448 --> 01:14:16,281
I will do well like you understand...

937
01:14:17,156 --> 01:14:19,073
Sorry will tell.

938
01:14:44,926 --> 01:14:46,343
Hey, you psycho idiot...

939
01:14:47,726 --> 01:14:48,786
Madam.

940
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:51,759
If you go with him, your guy will cut even
your neck and kill you madam.

941
01:14:57,089 --> 01:14:59,991
I am already pissed off
thinking how to convince,

942
01:15:00,071 --> 01:15:03,031
is this dialogue needed now rogue...

943
01:15:11,564 --> 01:15:13,781
Hey, no... No.

944
01:15:18,029 --> 01:15:22,323
You dirty rogue, understood what happens
if you mess with this girl?

945
01:15:38,774 --> 01:15:40,266
Jo, I am really sorry Jo.

946
01:15:40,531 --> 01:15:42,531
I did not see you here.
Nothing happened to you, right?

947
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:44,948
Believe at least now.

948
01:15:45,889 --> 01:15:47,573
Either you do knowingly or unknowingly,

949
01:15:48,448 --> 01:15:53,864
either by liking or not liking
but my death is in your hands.

950
01:20:12,489 --> 01:20:13,948
Destiny is very strange son.

951
01:20:15,369 --> 01:20:16,864
I and your dad were in love.

952
01:20:17,781 --> 01:20:19,906
But my parents did
not agree for our marriage.

953
01:20:20,656 --> 01:20:21,823
We did not feel bad for that.

954
01:20:22,948 --> 01:20:27,281
They believed the words of astrologers
who said we will not be happy if married.

955
01:20:28,147 --> 01:20:32,378
We believed the words from ourselves
to be happy

956
01:20:32,458 --> 01:20:34,239
whatever may be the troubles coming in.

957
01:20:35,196 --> 01:20:38,597
When doctors and reports were saying that

958
01:20:38,677 --> 01:20:40,406
we will have no kids
after three years of marriage,

959
01:20:40,981 --> 01:20:45,781
we felt that as words said by astrologers
but we did not feel bad for that.

960
01:20:47,698 --> 01:20:48,781
I became pregnant,

961
01:20:49,323 --> 01:20:53,656
but when in fifth month
they said kid will not be born.

962
01:20:54,645 --> 01:20:57,448
In the seventh month, they said even
if born kid would not be alive.

963
01:21:01,597 --> 01:21:02,739
You came onto this earth.

964
01:21:05,198 --> 01:21:07,614
You were so small infant.

965
01:21:08,948 --> 01:21:10,906
You were still without any movement.

966
01:21:11,864 --> 01:21:14,614
We never felt bad till then even
when anyone said anything.

967
01:21:15,610 --> 01:21:20,073
But seeing you so,
we could not bear the pain son.

968
01:21:25,555 --> 01:21:26,823
We were parents right?

969
01:21:28,448 --> 01:21:31,739
But we never lost the
confidence that you would live.

970
01:21:32,406 --> 01:21:35,073
We never let go the
efforts to keep you alive.

971
01:21:36,656 --> 01:21:41,448
Any mother would bear the delivery pains
to give birth to a kid.

972
01:21:42,531 --> 01:21:47,114
I and your dad went through
that pain for a month time.

973
01:21:49,656 --> 01:21:54,604
When you opened eyes
and cried after exactly a month,

974
01:21:54,684 --> 01:21:56,448
tears rolled out of our eyes.

975
01:21:58,698 --> 01:22:02,114
Then your cry won over the science.

976
01:22:02,906 --> 01:22:06,239
Tears rolling in our
eyes won over the horoscope.

977
01:22:07,906 --> 01:22:09,323
Then we understood,

978
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:16,489
there is some power greater
than this science or horoscope.

979
01:22:17,588 --> 01:22:23,739
No idea what that is but will definitely
come in our support when needed.

980
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:30,114
What we need to do is to fight
without stepping back till then.

981
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:37,823
Son, your birth itself
started with a victory.

982
01:22:38,702 --> 01:22:41,739
No chance at all to lose,
come on fight son.

983
01:23:15,738 --> 01:23:17,489
I know how much you loved Swathi.

984
01:23:18,052 --> 01:23:20,698
Still, I do not understood how did
so much of love turn at once into hatred.

985
01:23:21,989 --> 01:23:23,448
Why did you have to kill Swathi?

986
01:23:30,698 --> 01:23:32,906
I do not know whether this is science,
fate or the destiny.

987
01:23:33,114 --> 01:23:34,599
Whatever happens in your life is happening

988
01:23:34,679 --> 01:23:36,698
the same way even in our
lives exactly after one year.

989
01:23:37,608 --> 01:23:39,489
Brother, I should save Jo.

990
01:23:42,106 --> 01:23:43,364
I should save Jo from myself.

991
01:23:44,114 --> 01:23:47,739
If I know in what conditions you killed
Swathi, at least we can save our lives.

992
01:23:50,204 --> 01:23:51,989
Hello brother, please...

993
01:23:56,551 --> 01:23:58,698
Hey, can you not understand
when I am requesting so much?

994
01:23:58,983 --> 01:24:00,823
What for me if you kill someone or die?

995
01:24:00,903 --> 01:24:02,364
What is the relation between you and me?

996
01:24:03,073 --> 01:24:05,614
But that God has kept a
connection in between us right?

997
01:24:06,238 --> 01:24:08,781
Will you not believe?
See... See.

998
01:24:09,448 --> 01:24:10,989
At least now, say why did you kill Swathi.

999
01:24:13,881 --> 01:24:14,903
I understood.

1000
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:18,464
You killed as Swathi whom loved so much
had an affair unable to bear that right?

1001
01:24:19,864 --> 01:24:21,573
You are keeping silent now.
- Hey.

1002
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:24,406
I will kill you rogue
if you another word wrong about Swath.

1003
01:24:27,406 --> 01:24:30,031
I did not say this word brother,
people are talking outside.

1004
01:24:32,281 --> 01:24:35,073
If you still stay silent,
they think that is true too.

1005
01:24:39,573 --> 01:24:41,198
Why would I kill Swathi?

1006
01:24:44,573 --> 01:24:45,631
Then?

1007
01:24:46,193 --> 01:24:47,656
Swathi committed suicide.

1008
01:24:50,198 --> 01:24:51,159
What?

1009
01:24:51,239 --> 01:24:52,248
Yes.

1010
01:24:52,448 --> 01:24:54,114
Swathi committed suicide.

1011
01:24:57,005 --> 01:24:58,130
Suicide?

1012
01:25:01,864 --> 01:25:04,406
I did not expect to get married
so fast to the girl I loved.

1013
01:25:06,779 --> 01:25:08,411
In just two months after marriage...

1014
01:25:19,126 --> 01:25:22,131
I remember it quite well.
There was a hailstorm that day.

1015
01:25:32,304 --> 01:25:33,406
Hello Engineer,

1016
01:25:33,989 --> 01:25:35,073
is it always the work?

1017
01:25:35,698 --> 01:25:37,656
Is there a chance to care about me or not?

1018
01:25:39,239 --> 01:25:42,531
It is not enough just to plan
for having twins.

1019
01:25:42,735 --> 01:25:44,323
You should also execute.

1020
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:47,114
It is planning needed for execution.

1021
01:25:47,406 --> 01:25:51,073
Ok, then keep planning
and sit right there.

1022
01:25:51,589 --> 01:25:52,562
Then, should I not come?

1023
01:25:52,864 --> 01:25:54,489
Why, will you not come?

1024
01:25:55,031 --> 01:25:58,781
I will come, but gave the car to my friend
as he has his wedding anniversary.

1025
01:25:59,073 --> 01:26:00,614
Then, how will you come?

1026
01:26:00,948 --> 01:26:02,364
You will come and you will pick me up.

1027
01:26:03,156 --> 01:26:05,573
Me? I will not do driving.

1028
01:26:05,948 --> 01:26:08,864
Hey, how if you keep a block in mind
as you met with accident on bike?

1029
01:26:08,989 --> 01:26:09,656
Come, nothing will happen.

1030
01:26:10,073 --> 01:26:11,781
Srinu, please Srinu... I will not come.

1031
01:26:11,989 --> 01:26:14,281
Hey, you are coming and that is it. Bye.

1032
01:26:15,031 --> 01:26:15,614
Srinu...

1033
01:26:35,573 --> 01:26:38,823
It is raining heavily Srinu,
I am afraid too.

1034
01:26:39,198 --> 01:26:41,156
I will take a U turn and go back home

1035
01:26:41,448 --> 01:26:42,864
No way, you must come.

1036
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:44,989
Still you came half way, come the same.

1037
01:26:45,406 --> 01:26:48,281
It's Okay...I am at
Gachibowli clock tower.

1038
01:26:48,573 --> 01:26:49,573
Take left or right..!?

1039
01:26:50,281 --> 01:26:53,281
Take left and drive 1 Kilometer
and I will be in front of you.

1040
01:26:53,406 --> 01:26:54,698
Ok.
- Bye.

1041
01:27:47,311 --> 01:27:50,052
When five kids were being transferred for
an emergency treatment from

1042
01:27:50,132 --> 01:27:52,781
Olympus hospital to another.

1043
01:27:53,009 --> 01:27:55,156
A car dashed and an accident took place.

1044
01:27:55,398 --> 01:27:59,323
Five kids were burnt into ashes
right there as fire broke on the spot.

1045
01:27:59,766 --> 01:28:01,698
Their parents are unable
to come out from their pain.

1046
01:28:01,823 --> 01:28:04,989
Five kids Srinu...
Poor fellows.

1047
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:07,781
It is not even one
year since they were born.

1048
01:28:09,355 --> 01:28:13,448
Parents are into hell lot of crying,
because of me.

1049
01:28:14,792 --> 01:28:16,100
I did it.

1050
01:28:16,364 --> 01:28:18,114
Swathi calm down, it is not your mistake.

1051
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:21,448
You are talking about right and wrong.

1052
01:28:22,489 --> 01:28:24,364
I am talking about the kids who died.

1053
01:28:26,364 --> 01:28:28,906
At this time when we too
are wishing to have kids...

1054
01:28:29,614 --> 01:28:31,823
Swathi you are alive
and that is enough for me.

1055
01:28:36,281 --> 01:28:39,739
When I was refusing,
you made me do car driving.

1056
01:28:40,656 --> 01:28:46,406
Because of you, I drove the car and
I killed them all with my own hands.

1057
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:50,198
You are the reason... Because of you...

1058
01:28:50,573 --> 01:28:53,239
Swathi had gone into
depression after that accident.

1059
01:28:54,824 --> 01:28:57,667
She would say that she
saw those kids everywhere.

1060
01:29:01,603 --> 01:29:04,770
We consulted a psychiatrist
and tried various treatments.

1061
01:29:05,441 --> 01:29:06,911
And yet, I saw no change in her.

1062
01:29:07,732 --> 01:29:10,698
We moved to these apartments for a change.

1063
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:13,531
Depression in her further went increasing.

1064
01:29:14,337 --> 01:29:17,399
How many ever times I
tried to make her understand,

1065
01:29:17,479 --> 01:29:19,323
she has kept me away not understanding.

1066
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:23,072
She slowly lost control on her own self.

1067
01:29:23,152 --> 01:29:25,448
She used to take tablets
without any count and noticing.

1068
01:29:25,926 --> 01:29:30,406
With a fear that she would
go away from me, I too got emotional.

1069
01:29:31,343 --> 01:29:33,743
Are you any mad? When doctor
said not to take more than one,

1070
01:29:33,823 --> 01:29:35,472
you are taking so many and will die.

1071
01:29:35,552 --> 01:29:38,478
No problem I will die.
It is better to die than this torture.

1072
01:29:38,558 --> 01:29:40,406
Hey, why all this when you die?

1073
01:29:43,198 --> 01:29:48,489
One day, when I came back from office
and saw she was down unconscious.

1074
01:29:49,699 --> 01:29:51,823
Swathi... Swathi...

1075
01:29:54,834 --> 01:29:56,448
I immediately admitted
her in the hospital.

1076
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:59,614
Swathi... Swathi...

1077
01:29:59,893 --> 01:30:01,741
By the time I took reports
and went to the hospital...

1078
01:30:01,821 --> 01:30:05,114
Excuse me sir, your wife is not here, sir.

1079
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:06,281
Not here?

1080
01:30:06,361 --> 01:30:08,823
Where did she go?
- No idea sir, she ran away.

1081
01:30:10,617 --> 01:30:12,156
By the time I went home and saw...

1082
01:30:21,073 --> 01:30:22,226
Swathi...

1083
01:30:43,948 --> 01:30:49,239
Swathi, whom I feared would go away had
herself decided to go far away completely.

1084
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:55,113
I am the reason for that.

1085
01:30:56,669 --> 01:31:00,114
For driving the car,
for the accident to happen,

1086
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:03,531
for my Swathi to become
so because of those kids dying...

1087
01:31:03,934 --> 01:31:05,134
I am the reason.

1088
01:31:06,312 --> 01:31:07,823
I killed my Swathi.

1089
01:31:09,656 --> 01:31:12,571
I killed her...

1090
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:17,656
Bro, did you speak with Srinivas?

1091
01:31:18,073 --> 01:31:19,531
Did he say why he killed, bro?

1092
01:31:21,392 --> 01:31:22,581
Srinivas did not kill Swathi.

1093
01:31:22,661 --> 01:31:24,284
Then?
- She committed suicide

1094
01:31:24,364 --> 01:31:25,771
Suicide.

1095
01:31:27,698 --> 01:31:30,531
Bro, this looks dangerous than murder.

1096
01:31:30,765 --> 01:31:34,073
Still, how will we get to know where and
when would Jo commit suicide, bro?

1097
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:35,194
For her to do so,

1098
01:31:35,274 --> 01:31:37,281
the same happening in life of Swathi
should happen in the life of Jo too.

1099
01:31:37,361 --> 01:31:38,823
That means, she should drive car

1100
01:31:39,046 --> 01:31:40,156
and that car should meet with an accident.

1101
01:31:40,354 --> 01:31:42,906
She should go into a depression
and then she would commit suicide.

1102
01:31:43,306 --> 01:31:45,948
If we can stop all these from happening,
Jo will not commit suicide.

1103
01:31:53,685 --> 01:31:55,698
Jeeva, I love you.

1104
01:31:56,258 --> 01:31:59,781
The pain you are having
when I am keeping you away...

1105
01:32:00,906 --> 01:32:04,156
I can understand seeing
my pain being away from you.

1106
01:32:04,917 --> 01:32:07,989
I do not know why destiny
has so much of anger on me

1107
01:32:08,506 --> 01:32:10,531
but my mom died as and when I was born.

1108
01:32:11,339 --> 01:32:14,323
My sister took great
trouble to bring me up.

1109
01:32:15,114 --> 01:32:19,406
And now you loving me are going to face
troubles because of me.

1110
01:32:21,531 --> 01:32:22,864
I do not like that Jeeva.

1111
01:32:23,739 --> 01:32:26,323
Is this needed to you for
the reason that you loved me?

1112
01:32:27,114 --> 01:32:30,073
Instead to die in your
hands and send you to Jail,

1113
01:32:31,470 --> 01:32:33,698
I wish to commit suicide myself.

1114
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:35,906
Suicide?

1115
01:32:42,747 --> 01:32:43,409
Call her.

1116
01:32:43,489 --> 01:32:45,739
I am calling, bro, she is not lifting.

1117
01:32:52,364 --> 01:32:54,156
Damn... she is not lifting bro.

1118
01:33:37,405 --> 01:33:38,448
Sorry, bro.

1119
01:33:59,677 --> 01:34:00,323
Jo...

1120
01:34:34,236 --> 01:34:38,864
Really great courage is needed to die.

1121
01:34:40,161 --> 01:34:42,406
I do not have so much courage.

1122
01:34:43,436 --> 01:34:45,531
When you have so much love to die for me,

1123
01:34:46,614 --> 01:34:48,885
you think I do not have
that much love to save you?

1124
01:34:51,253 --> 01:34:55,573
It is not a solution for you
to commit suicide for me or I for you, Jo.

1125
01:34:57,944 --> 01:35:01,167
If it comes on to the life of the girl
I love, I will fight with fate, destiny

1126
01:35:01,247 --> 01:35:02,928
or even with the death.

1127
01:35:05,912 --> 01:35:07,144
I am sorry Jeeva.

1128
01:35:12,906 --> 01:35:19,823
When you are with me,
what if a day, month or a year.

1129
01:35:21,614 --> 01:35:25,864
How many ever days it may be,
I will be with you.

1130
01:35:26,896 --> 01:35:28,290
That is enough for me.

1131
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,323
Is Jo ok, bro?

1132
01:35:45,403 --> 01:35:47,864
Did you say Swathi is not murdered
but committed suicide?

1133
01:35:48,225 --> 01:35:49,274
I did not say.

1134
01:35:49,489 --> 01:35:50,722
You should have said, bro.

1135
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:56,739
Swathi is not committed suicide.

1136
01:35:57,073 --> 01:35:58,906
Not a suicide? Then?

1137
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:01,230
Murder.

1138
01:36:01,998 --> 01:36:03,046
Murder?

1139
01:36:03,825 --> 01:36:05,531
Jo does not have courage
to commit suicide.

1140
01:36:06,019 --> 01:36:08,364
That means even Swathi will not have had
so much courage.

1141
01:36:09,323 --> 01:36:10,698
This definitely will be a murder.

1142
01:36:11,166 --> 01:36:14,198
Then, has Srinivas done that murder, bro?

1143
01:36:17,948 --> 01:36:21,073
I will not murder a
girl whom I loved so much.

1144
01:36:21,281 --> 01:36:23,364
No, not you, bro... Srinivas.

1145
01:36:23,698 --> 01:36:24,739
I and he are the same.

1146
01:36:27,406 --> 01:36:28,406
Then Swathi?

1147
01:36:29,156 --> 01:36:33,739
If we know how Swathi died,
we can know how Jo would die.

1148
01:36:34,282 --> 01:36:35,114
How, bro?

1149
01:36:35,352 --> 01:36:37,452
Jo used to say that Swathi
used to sit mostly before the computer

1150
01:36:37,532 --> 01:36:39,906
and often used to give kisses too.

1151
01:36:40,207 --> 01:36:42,989
To know with whom Swathi talked to,
we shall check her computer.

1152
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:45,239
That means, we should get into their flat.

1153
01:36:45,569 --> 01:36:47,489
Police seized that flat, right, bro?

1154
01:36:47,731 --> 01:36:48,585
How will you open it?

1155
01:36:48,665 --> 01:36:51,239
It is a small deed dude,
it a spoon fed art for me.

1156
01:36:51,775 --> 01:36:53,656
You get the spoon and I will get the art.

1157
01:36:53,736 --> 01:36:56,239
We both together would
empty the total house.

1158
01:36:57,904 --> 01:36:59,489
I am vacating this
apartment and leaving, sir.

1159
01:36:59,785 --> 01:37:01,198
It does not seem to
work out being here, sir.

1160
01:37:01,764 --> 01:37:02,791
Bye, sir...

1161
01:37:04,781 --> 01:37:07,031
Hey, before vacating you
should open the lock of a flat.

1162
01:37:07,504 --> 01:37:10,114
Should open the lock? Then you too are...

1163
01:37:10,877 --> 01:37:12,909
Slowly competition is growing
even for our profession, sir.

1164
01:37:12,989 --> 01:37:13,618
Oh damn.

1165
01:37:13,698 --> 01:37:16,114
It is ok as you said.
Which flat should I open?

1166
01:37:16,336 --> 01:37:17,698
B block, 510, bro.

1167
01:37:17,991 --> 01:37:19,031
510?
- Yes.

1168
01:37:19,201 --> 01:37:20,781
That means the flat
in which murder took place.

1169
01:37:21,239 --> 01:37:23,489
My granny used to say devils
exist at the place of murder,

1170
01:37:23,656 --> 01:37:25,137
I fear a lot about devils, sir.

1171
01:37:25,418 --> 01:37:27,531
I will bring the photo
of Lord Hanuman, bro.

1172
01:37:27,611 --> 01:37:28,323
Hail Lord Hanuman.

1173
01:37:28,403 --> 01:37:29,602
You just open the door once

1174
01:37:29,682 --> 01:37:31,864
and we will leave taking the computer
hard disk in two minutes.

1175
01:37:32,423 --> 01:37:33,698
Hard disk?
- Yes.

1176
01:37:34,434 --> 01:37:35,698
But, hard disk is not out there, sir.

1177
01:37:38,402 --> 01:37:40,073
Not there? What happened then?

1178
01:37:40,748 --> 01:37:41,656
That is...

1179
01:37:42,067 --> 01:37:42,989
What happened then?

1180
01:37:43,861 --> 01:37:46,948
I went inside to rob at peace
as it was a locked house, sir.

1181
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:00,364
Who is this fellow?

1182
01:38:00,444 --> 01:38:02,989
When I am paying so much
rent and doing robberies,

1183
01:38:03,489 --> 01:38:04,864
will he come in competition to me?

1184
01:38:04,989 --> 01:38:06,424
I will finish him...

1185
01:38:17,323 --> 01:38:19,906
Aslam Bhai, I took the hard disk.

1186
01:38:20,142 --> 01:38:22,906
I will come to Beans
coffee shop by evening 6:30.

1187
01:38:23,239 --> 01:38:25,656
What Bhai, another important work?

1188
01:38:26,921 --> 01:38:30,114
Ok then, I will be there by seven.

1189
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:32,781
Then I will come at 8 and do the robbery.

1190
01:38:38,499 --> 01:38:40,156
Come on, we will go to Beans coffee shop.

1191
01:38:40,236 --> 01:38:40,864
Sir.

1192
01:38:41,397 --> 01:38:44,864
That Beans coffee shop is better than
this apartment. We can slightly chill.

1193
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:47,752
Bro, there are 4 beans coffee
shops in total in Hyderabad.

1194
01:38:47,832 --> 01:38:49,073
Which coffee shop will we go, bro?

1195
01:38:50,044 --> 01:38:51,781
It is gone bro, it is all gone.

1196
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,239
The only chance we had is gone.

1197
01:38:53,535 --> 01:38:55,531
How will we save Jo now, bro?

1198
01:38:55,773 --> 01:38:58,151
What Bhai, another important work?

1199
01:38:58,757 --> 01:38:59,427
It is difficult now.

1200
01:38:59,507 --> 01:39:01,948
It is already six and which
branch will we go to, bro?

1201
01:39:02,346 --> 01:39:03,031
Mehdipatnam...

1202
01:39:04,270 --> 01:39:05,156
What? Mehdipatnam?

1203
01:39:05,236 --> 01:39:07,781
We should go to Mehdipatnam
Beans coffee shop.

1204
01:39:13,773 --> 01:39:16,531
Bro, more girls come
to Banjara Hills coffee shop.

1205
01:39:16,789 --> 01:39:18,739
50% GST sale too is running now, bro.

1206
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:21,573
So, my seventh sense says
that fellow would come there.

1207
01:39:22,906 --> 01:39:24,364
Your wish bro, as you like.

1208
01:39:25,513 --> 01:39:28,864
Hey idiot,
say a hot Mozito with cold cubes for me.

1209
01:39:28,944 --> 01:39:31,198
Hey, they would hit if
you call waiters like that here.

1210
01:39:31,404 --> 01:39:35,114
Still that is not Mojito, J is silent..

1211
01:39:35,544 --> 01:39:38,474
Thief, does not know English at all.
- I did not call the waiter,

1212
01:39:38,554 --> 01:39:39,698
but you idiot.

1213
01:39:39,778 --> 01:39:41,816
Me?
- Yes, rogue.

1214
01:39:42,378 --> 01:39:43,698
What is this nuisance
forgetting the work we came for?

1215
01:39:43,778 --> 01:39:47,406
Damn! What did I ask, bro?
Hot Mojito with cold cubes.

1216
01:39:47,686 --> 01:39:50,448
That is the drink Abraham Lincoln
and John F Kennedy would have right?

1217
01:39:53,211 --> 01:39:54,156
How do you know that?

1218
01:39:56,130 --> 01:39:57,031
He did not say me.

1219
01:39:57,783 --> 01:39:58,810
Puppy...

1220
01:40:00,151 --> 01:40:02,052
That is while coming on the bike I said

1221
01:40:02,132 --> 01:40:05,323
C, C++ as he said was boring
and he said it was confusing.

1222
01:40:05,621 --> 01:40:08,239
Then I said your story and
he said it was very interesting.

1223
01:40:09,902 --> 01:40:13,073
These software guys are so bro, they say
those which shall not be said to someone.

1224
01:40:13,153 --> 01:40:14,073
More intelligence.

1225
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:16,031
Wow, thanks bro... Hi five.

1226
01:40:16,854 --> 01:40:18,698
Did you not understand
whether I praised or insulted?

1227
01:40:18,909 --> 01:40:20,239
Software guys are so, right, bro.

1228
01:40:20,319 --> 01:40:23,781
Hey, it is seven.
Observe all those who came.

1229
01:40:24,206 --> 01:40:25,114
Say me if that fellow comes.

1230
01:40:25,427 --> 01:40:28,701
For you to escape from going to jail,
you blackmail to send me to jail?

1231
01:40:28,781 --> 01:40:30,323
I will not see and
will not say even if I see.

1232
01:40:31,913 --> 01:40:34,573
I have no fear that I would go to jail.

1233
01:40:35,232 --> 01:40:38,531
I should save the girl I loved
and this is the only way I have.

1234
01:40:39,038 --> 01:40:43,198
Be careful and watch and say,

1235
01:40:43,815 --> 01:40:46,989
if he is seen I will not
just hit this time but will kill.

1236
01:40:48,031 --> 01:40:51,448
Will he come right to this coffee shop?
- He will and he will surely come.

1237
01:41:07,114 --> 01:41:08,238
That fellow.

1238
01:41:19,319 --> 01:41:19,948
How?

1239
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:23,573
He spoke to Aslam Bhai on the other
side in phone and he is a Muslim person.

1240
01:41:24,519 --> 01:41:27,198
When he said to come by 6:30,
he said will come at 7.

1241
01:41:27,491 --> 01:41:31,198
What important work will every Muslim
in the evenings and that too on a Friday.

1242
01:41:32,152 --> 01:41:33,114
Prayer of Mehreeb,

1243
01:41:33,773 --> 01:41:35,531
means the prayer done after the Sunset.

1244
01:41:36,367 --> 01:41:39,656
When there are four Beans Coffee shops
in Hyderabad, 3 have no mosque near them.

1245
01:41:40,198 --> 01:41:44,656
This is the only Beans Coffee shop he can
finish his prayer by 6:30 and come by 7.

1246
01:41:45,082 --> 01:41:47,281
So modable, how bro?

1247
01:41:48,073 --> 01:41:49,531
Confidence.
- On you?

1248
01:41:54,531 --> 01:41:57,364
Religion may be a block for human
to do good but not for God.

1249
01:41:58,887 --> 01:41:59,958
Aslam Bhai.

1250
01:42:00,714 --> 01:42:01,989
Hey Billi Bhai.

1251
01:42:04,326 --> 01:42:06,364
Hello.
- Hello.

1252
01:42:17,481 --> 01:42:19,198
What are they talking bro?

1253
01:42:19,739 --> 01:42:21,823
No idea, but we should listen.

1254
01:42:22,054 --> 01:42:22,941
How?

1255
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:27,073
Hey boy, where is the tissue?

1256
01:42:31,656 --> 01:42:33,281
Hey, give the phone.
- Mine.

1257
01:42:33,361 --> 01:42:34,364
Give it once.

1258
01:42:34,444 --> 01:42:37,573
I robbed this with great difficulty bro.
This is imported brand, Theppo.

1259
01:42:46,323 --> 01:42:47,614
Hey boy, come here.

1260
01:42:48,824 --> 01:42:50,294
Give this tissue box there.

1261
01:42:50,374 --> 01:42:52,448
I will give another, sir.
- Give it dude.

1262
01:42:53,473 --> 01:42:54,739
Give it dude, give it.

1263
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:58,906
Being a thief I do not
have so much brains, how bro?

1264
01:42:59,073 --> 01:43:01,622
You are just a thief
and his uncle is a bandit.

1265
01:43:01,702 --> 01:43:04,114
Oh, in front there
is a crocodile festival.

1266
01:43:04,194 --> 01:43:05,136
Yeah.

1267
01:43:06,854 --> 01:43:08,989
You did the work I said great...

1268
01:43:11,709 --> 01:43:13,906
Billi bro, you are saying high rate.

1269
01:43:14,402 --> 01:43:19,323
Aslam bro, money you gave are enough
for bringing the hard disk.

1270
01:43:19,861 --> 01:43:21,823
Then, for doing the murder?

1271
01:43:23,883 --> 01:43:25,116
What? Murder?

1272
01:43:27,083 --> 01:43:29,239
That is a big gated community bro...

1273
01:43:29,645 --> 01:43:32,921
Slipping from security,
following that girl,

1274
01:43:33,001 --> 01:43:35,149
getting to know where her flat is

1275
01:43:35,229 --> 01:43:37,781
and by the time
I went inside the flat from backside,

1276
01:43:38,694 --> 01:43:41,989
she was sitting before
the computer and doing something.

1277
01:43:43,029 --> 01:43:48,573
She was so hot bro, like a doll.
I thought to eat her.

1278
01:43:49,239 --> 01:43:53,823
By the time I thought to enjoy
and kill someone rang the door bell.

1279
01:44:32,261 --> 01:44:35,531
Bhai... Why did you
ask to bring that hard disk?

1280
01:44:36,488 --> 01:44:38,077
What do I know dude?

1281
01:44:38,326 --> 01:44:41,514
I said she did something
in the computer before murdering.

1282
01:44:41,594 --> 01:44:43,838
He said what would she
do in a life and death situation

1283
01:44:43,918 --> 01:44:46,198
in that computer and I said no idea.

1284
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:50,531
Bhai said to go bring the hard disk from
computer and that is it that boss?

1285
01:44:50,757 --> 01:44:54,448
Very dangerous, who is that boss?

1286
01:45:03,406 --> 01:45:06,985
Take out the hard disk and I should leave

1287
01:45:09,882 --> 01:45:10,866
Damn...

1288
01:45:12,509 --> 01:45:15,656
You too are very dangerous,
take out the money first.

1289
01:45:15,736 --> 01:45:17,341
Even this Billi too is dangerous,

1290
01:45:17,421 --> 01:45:19,536
we should stamp on his neck and ask him.

1291
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:20,906
No use catching him.

1292
01:45:21,262 --> 01:45:23,637
To know who planned for this murder,
we should follow Aslam Bhai.

1293
01:45:24,012 --> 01:45:25,637
Puppy, we will follow Aslam Bhai.

1294
01:45:25,971 --> 01:45:26,762
You follow Billi.

1295
01:45:26,929 --> 01:45:28,179
Why should I follow? I will not.

1296
01:45:29,512 --> 01:45:32,221
Why should I not? I should follow
and I will have to follow.

1297
01:45:32,304 --> 01:45:34,012
Bro... Aslam Bhai is leaving.

1298
01:45:35,221 --> 01:45:37,762
Yes bro, work is done
and I took the hard disk.

1299
01:45:37,929 --> 01:45:39,096
Yes bro, send the vehicle.

1300
01:45:47,012 --> 01:45:50,971
Hi my darling,
say dear how are you, my baby?

1301
01:45:51,429 --> 01:45:53,679
You come to Hyderabad from Amamravathi?

1302
01:45:54,096 --> 01:45:59,762
Oh darling, I am full busy on a work
and will see you tomorrow.

1303
01:45:59,971 --> 01:46:04,929
She was so hot bro, like a doll.
I thought to eat her.

1304
01:46:06,762 --> 01:46:08,056
We will meet tomorrow dear.

1305
01:46:11,753 --> 01:46:12,715
Bro...

1306
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:43,346
Oh no, that fellow looks like a buffalo.

1307
01:46:51,624 --> 01:46:52,997
Finish...

1308
01:46:57,512 --> 01:47:05,679
Hey rain in the blue sky.
Shall I dance along with you.

1309
01:47:07,054 --> 01:47:09,596
Sir, I am blind, sir.

1310
01:47:09,887 --> 01:47:11,679
Even my hand does not function well, sir.

1311
01:47:12,218 --> 01:47:16,637
I cannot hit myself, sir...
How will I hit you, sir?

1312
01:47:18,512 --> 01:47:23,096
Hey rain in the blue sky.
Thank God.

1313
01:47:23,429 --> 01:47:27,096
Sir, put your material inside
and close the zip. We are dying to see it.

1314
01:47:31,804 --> 01:47:33,846
Bro, he is leaving.
Come fast.

1315
01:47:36,648 --> 01:47:37,708
Come fast...

1316
01:47:50,179 --> 01:47:51,179
Sir, have the ground nut.

1317
01:47:51,471 --> 01:47:52,096
No please.

1318
01:47:52,179 --> 01:47:53,137
They will be good, take.

1319
01:47:53,721 --> 01:47:55,596
Should we eat your dirty...

1320
01:47:56,596 --> 01:47:58,137
Ok bro, fine.

1321
01:48:08,971 --> 01:48:11,012
I do not like this unhygienic...
- Puppy, Aslam is coming.

1322
01:48:13,221 --> 01:48:15,096
Why is he coming bro?
By chance, did he come to know?

1323
01:48:17,221 --> 01:48:18,887
Bro, give me groundnut
for 10 rupees please.

1324
01:48:18,967 --> 01:48:19,932
I will not sell

1325
01:48:20,012 --> 01:48:20,971
Please, bro.

1326
01:48:22,262 --> 01:48:24,512
By chance did he know?
- Hey, belt bag.

1327
01:48:25,429 --> 01:48:26,280
Bro.

1328
01:48:26,518 --> 01:48:27,554
Do you have a match box?

1329
01:48:29,429 --> 01:48:32,137
Did you ask for a match box?
I thought you knew and was frightened.

1330
01:48:32,762 --> 01:48:34,721
I get to know, what will I know?

1331
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:37,637
That is, my fellow is mad of ground nuts.

1332
01:48:37,762 --> 01:48:39,221
Why did he say my ground nut is waste.

1333
01:48:39,721 --> 01:48:43,266
He did not say so, he said to
be crazy of ground nut... You rogue...

1334
01:48:43,346 --> 01:48:44,179
Still, I will not sell to him.

1335
01:48:44,304 --> 01:48:46,721
Why will you not sell?
I came first and asked.

1336
01:48:47,012 --> 01:48:47,971
You should sell me.

1337
01:48:48,596 --> 01:48:49,804
You say justice Aslam Bhai.

1338
01:48:51,137 --> 01:48:52,096
Aslam...

1339
01:48:52,176 --> 01:48:54,804
Hey, how did you know my name rogue?

1340
01:48:55,721 --> 01:48:58,043
Who would not know the name of great
Aslam Bhai in the old city?

1341
01:48:59,554 --> 01:49:00,512
Can we not make out by seeing?

1342
01:49:00,592 --> 01:49:03,054
Said it correct boy, hey give matches.

1343
01:49:03,429 --> 01:49:04,346
Take, bro.

1344
01:49:07,590 --> 01:49:09,762
Hey dude, see you.
- Bye, bro.

1345
01:49:11,773 --> 01:49:12,887
Sorry, bro...

1346
01:49:14,704 --> 01:49:16,012
It was unexpectedly...

1347
01:49:29,265 --> 01:49:30,554
Come on bro, we will follow.

1348
01:49:30,786 --> 01:49:31,747
What to follow?

1349
01:49:31,827 --> 01:49:33,827
He would definitely get a doubt
if followed after your performance.

1350
01:49:34,617 --> 01:49:35,611
What shall we do now?

1351
01:49:35,925 --> 01:49:37,577
AP 07 PP 7777

1352
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:40,494
if we know who the owner of this car is
we will get to know who got Swathi killed.

1353
01:49:42,011 --> 01:49:45,200
AP 07 PP 7777...

1354
01:49:46,032 --> 01:49:47,331
7777...

1355
01:49:47,411 --> 01:49:48,638
Puppy.

1356
01:49:49,935 --> 01:49:51,206
Where did I listen to this car number?

1357
01:49:51,459 --> 01:49:53,329
You just said fancy number 7777.

1358
01:49:53,409 --> 01:49:54,539
No, I am not talking about you.

1359
01:49:56,831 --> 01:49:58,302
That White Audi 7777.

1360
01:49:59,210 --> 01:50:01,880
Yes, white Audi 7777

1361
01:50:04,577 --> 01:50:06,350
Beside white Audi car.

1362
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:08,619
Audi 7777.

1363
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:11,973
That was the car which went reverse

1364
01:50:12,053 --> 01:50:13,599
in between when Srinivas
met Swathi for the first time.

1365
01:50:14,722 --> 01:50:16,052
God must be crazy, bro.

1366
01:50:16,366 --> 01:50:21,306
He put hero, heroine and villain
in between right at the B 57 pillar.

1367
01:50:22,268 --> 01:50:24,549
Then, where did he put
the villain in your life.

1368
01:50:34,277 --> 01:50:37,661
TS 09 AA 9999, Black Benz car.

1369
01:50:38,558 --> 01:50:40,053
That was the car going in reverse

1370
01:50:40,133 --> 01:50:41,536
in between us
when I met Jo for the first time.

1371
01:50:42,644 --> 01:50:44,244
That means, the guy to kill Jo...

1372
01:50:44,925 --> 01:50:45,952
Owner of that black car.

1373
01:50:53,260 --> 01:50:54,968
Sir, I have 101 fever.

1374
01:50:56,024 --> 01:50:59,274
I do not talk much do not
like anyone talking too much.

1375
01:50:59,746 --> 01:51:00,988
Baba Singh Manmohan! Said that.

1376
01:51:02,557 --> 01:51:04,940
Take him and put him behind bars.
- Sir, please.

1377
01:51:05,179 --> 01:51:06,348
Drinking and driving
is an offense in itself.

1378
01:51:06,428 --> 01:51:08,197
And, I don't tolerate
anyone who insults my mentor.

1379
01:51:08,277 --> 01:51:09,868
Useless fellow!

1380
01:51:10,706 --> 01:51:13,003
I need address of these two cars.
I will wait for you there.

1381
01:51:13,247 --> 01:51:14,899
Hello, what is this money
and what are these addresses?

1382
01:51:18,233 --> 01:51:18,900
Bribe?

1383
01:51:19,573 --> 01:51:22,775
Still, why will I have the addresses?
What are you thinking about me?

1384
01:51:22,855 --> 01:51:25,912
I do not talk much do not
like anyone talking too much.

1385
01:51:26,942 --> 01:51:28,320
Hey you too devotee
of Baba Singh Manmohan!

1386
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:29,373
Got to know.

1387
01:51:29,942 --> 01:51:34,400
You go and sit there. I will get
this address, however difficult it may be.

1388
01:52:30,317 --> 01:52:33,067
That means 510 Swathi is disturbing you.

1389
01:52:34,093 --> 01:52:36,523
You think she turned a devil? May be...

1390
01:52:37,085 --> 01:52:39,403
She used to haunt her husband like
devil when alive itself.

1391
01:52:41,132 --> 01:52:41,937
What?

1392
01:52:42,438 --> 01:52:45,733
That 520 Pankajam used to say that
she used to torture husband.

1393
01:52:45,983 --> 01:52:48,900
That fellow is so tall
like Bhallaladeva of Bahubali.

1394
01:52:49,167 --> 01:52:49,817
What is the use?

1395
01:52:50,025 --> 01:52:51,483
He could not keep his wife in control.

1396
01:52:52,317 --> 01:52:54,820
Hey, he used to come
drunk daily and hit her.

1397
01:52:54,900 --> 01:52:56,398
If she has an affair with another

1398
01:52:56,478 --> 01:52:58,358
even after marriage
will they encourage instead of hitting?

1399
01:52:58,525 --> 01:53:00,275
Shut up, she is not like that.

1400
01:53:00,358 --> 01:53:02,108
Oh no, do we not know or what?

1401
01:53:02,261 --> 01:53:05,400
Doing video calls after husband sleeps
and giving kisses in mails...

1402
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:07,608
512 Padmaja aunty said it.

1403
01:53:07,787 --> 01:53:10,969
Hey, it would not be so.
- Why not, it would be.

1404
01:53:11,049 --> 01:53:11,900
It will not be.

1405
01:53:12,509 --> 01:53:15,935
Because she and I are same.

1406
01:53:17,613 --> 01:53:22,108
Same... Then whom did
she give kisses in that mail?

1407
01:53:25,830 --> 01:53:27,233
Can we know her mail ID?

1408
01:53:31,927 --> 01:53:35,150
We have mail ID and password...
Shall we hack?

1409
01:53:35,672 --> 01:53:40,525
No need, if we click forgot password there
would be minimum three security questions.

1410
01:53:40,896 --> 01:53:43,692
Mail opens up if we answer them correctly.

1411
01:53:44,018 --> 01:53:48,192
Not so easy, those are security
personal questions she has kept.

1412
01:53:48,463 --> 01:53:50,067
How will we know personal details?

1413
01:53:50,938 --> 01:53:51,858
I will get to know.

1414
01:53:52,036 --> 01:53:55,275
What, get to know? How?

1415
01:53:55,885 --> 01:53:58,687
I hope that Swathi from 510 did
not become a ghost and enter into her.

1416
01:53:58,903 --> 01:54:00,953
Who is your role model?

1417
01:54:01,186 --> 01:54:04,483
I think Suryakantham of old movies,
she too is hard nut like her.

1418
01:54:06,230 --> 01:54:07,817
My role model is my mother.

1419
01:54:08,833 --> 01:54:10,525
Who needs yours, we need of her.

1420
01:54:19,652 --> 01:54:20,400
Yes.

1421
01:54:21,875 --> 01:54:23,873
Oh God!

1422
01:54:25,161 --> 01:54:28,025
Who is your favorite music director?

1423
01:54:29,701 --> 01:54:30,567
Ilayaraja.

1424
01:54:34,864 --> 01:54:35,567
Yes.

1425
01:54:37,389 --> 01:54:39,608
Where did you first meet?

1426
01:54:41,368 --> 01:54:42,442
Yes, Inorbit Mall.

1427
01:54:44,541 --> 01:54:47,608
No, B 57.

1428
01:54:50,562 --> 01:54:52,192
Yes, mail got opened.

1429
01:54:52,534 --> 01:54:53,567
Oh God

1430
01:54:53,944 --> 01:54:56,410
Hey, what happened?
Definitely 510 Swathi came as devil.

1431
01:54:56,490 --> 01:54:57,442
What happened Snigdha?

1432
01:54:58,615 --> 01:55:00,817
What happened? Snigdha come back dear.

1433
01:55:02,143 --> 01:55:04,400
Huh... Sent box...

1434
01:55:05,724 --> 01:55:07,733
What, did she send mail to Srinivas?

1435
01:55:13,092 --> 01:55:16,025
Srinu, all the mistake is mine.

1436
01:55:17,382 --> 01:55:21,900
One incident has made
our life upside down.

1437
01:55:22,493 --> 01:55:26,067
I am unable to, but will try to forget.

1438
01:55:26,506 --> 01:55:28,317
It does not mean I do not love you Srinu.

1439
01:55:29,483 --> 01:55:31,942
I love you, I love you so much.

1440
01:55:37,309 --> 01:55:44,443
That means, Swathi has kissed...
Her husband.

1441
01:55:47,592 --> 01:55:50,483
Sir, with great difficulty
I got address of a number.

1442
01:55:50,836 --> 01:55:51,674
Which number?

1443
01:55:51,830 --> 01:55:52,733
7777.

1444
01:55:52,903 --> 01:55:54,608
That is the number of the
guy who killed Swathi, right bro?

1445
01:55:54,883 --> 01:55:56,207
Killing? What killing, sir?

1446
01:55:56,579 --> 01:55:59,723
Not killing, address of
the guy who told us about Swathi.

1447
01:55:59,803 --> 01:56:01,067
Oh, okay. Then it's alright.

1448
01:56:01,147 --> 01:56:03,775
Tell us the address first.
- I will say, sir.

1449
01:56:04,090 --> 01:56:05,483
Who do you think s this address?

1450
01:56:05,759 --> 01:56:10,942
It is of TSS Tarun, MD of the best
hospital of South India Olympus hospital.

1451
01:56:23,537 --> 01:56:27,287
He always thinks to provide treatment
but never thinks of money, sir.

1452
01:56:27,367 --> 01:56:29,037
He has no business mind at all, sir.

1453
01:56:30,029 --> 01:56:31,787
Business and this is business.

1454
01:56:33,626 --> 01:56:36,203
Hundreds crores of investment
and publicity of tens of crores.

1455
01:56:36,850 --> 01:56:40,892
Bribes in crores and salaries in Lakhs
and employees in thousands.

1456
01:56:41,357 --> 01:56:46,017
I am not any great man to serve free with
all these and this is not any Arogya Sri.

1457
01:56:46,537 --> 01:56:49,475
Business,
a business done just for the profits.

1458
01:56:52,225 --> 01:56:53,725
I think you are Dr. Vikram?

1459
01:56:54,321 --> 01:56:54,979
Yes, sir

1460
01:56:55,059 --> 01:56:58,392
Is your target this month done?
- No, sir, I tried my level best.

1461
01:56:58,688 --> 01:57:01,672
But some patients were
cured with basic medication.

1462
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:04,687
Brother, which place are you from?

1463
01:57:04,767 --> 01:57:06,187
Palakollu sir, your native.

1464
01:57:06,267 --> 01:57:07,684
They talk Telugu there right?

1465
01:57:08,253 --> 01:57:08,979
Yes, sir.

1466
01:57:09,135 --> 01:57:10,517
Why are you not talking here then?

1467
01:57:11,946 --> 01:57:15,284
Second look about mother tongue
or an ego of studying high?

1468
01:57:15,475 --> 01:57:16,350
Sorry, sir.

1469
01:57:16,788 --> 01:57:19,141
Say now, why did you
not reach your target?

1470
01:57:19,418 --> 01:57:21,947
It was cured for few patients

1471
01:57:22,027 --> 01:57:25,350
with basic treatment
without going for an operation, sir.

1472
01:57:25,662 --> 01:57:26,561
Look brother,

1473
01:57:26,725 --> 01:57:28,696
if public need the basic treatment

1474
01:57:28,776 --> 01:57:31,326
they go to RMP roadside
but why will they come here?

1475
01:57:31,749 --> 01:57:36,767
Coming to Corporate hospital means they
got ready to spend even crores for life.

1476
01:57:38,530 --> 01:57:41,434
We shall cash their fear and doubts.

1477
01:57:41,851 --> 01:57:45,934
We should do business maintaining diseases
on edge without reducing or increasing.

1478
01:57:46,384 --> 01:57:47,142
Sit.

1479
01:57:47,892 --> 01:57:50,559
Anyone uses money from pockets for a need.

1480
01:57:50,860 --> 01:57:52,251
But if it comes on to the life,

1481
01:57:52,331 --> 01:57:53,809
he uses money even from
the pockets of the guy beside.

1482
01:57:54,253 --> 01:57:57,309
This policy is the start
and foundation for this hospital.

1483
01:58:07,719 --> 01:58:08,673
Hello, sir.

1484
01:58:09,691 --> 01:58:10,481
Hello, sir.

1485
01:58:11,049 --> 01:58:11,844
This is the hard disk.

1486
01:58:12,978 --> 01:58:13,686
Have they come?

1487
01:58:13,770 --> 01:58:14,478
I made them sit in.

1488
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:27,728
This is a computer hard disk. With
this what is done in that hard disk, re...

1489
01:58:29,353 --> 01:58:31,186
What is that Varma?
- Recent activities.

1490
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:33,353
Yes, the same..
Can that be known?

1491
01:58:33,526 --> 01:58:34,853
Sure, sir, that can be done.

1492
01:58:34,933 --> 01:58:36,603
I think this has a
Windows operating system

1493
01:58:36,686 --> 01:58:39,390
and Windows keeps track of every recent
activity in detail in the key log...

1494
01:58:39,470 --> 01:58:40,263
Telugu.

1495
01:58:40,811 --> 01:58:41,941
Our mother tongue...

1496
01:58:43,118 --> 01:58:46,270
This fellow is like Telugu Trump.
Mr. Janardhan, you take it forward.

1497
01:58:46,350 --> 01:58:47,658
Sure Mr. James.
- Yeah.

1498
01:58:48,021 --> 01:58:50,856
To see the mechanical system runs with
a software Windows...

1499
01:58:50,936 --> 01:58:51,811
You crazy...

1500
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:55,770
Can we know or not?
- We can know, sir.

1501
01:58:55,944 --> 01:58:59,020
In this re...
- Recent activities.

1502
01:58:59,446 --> 01:59:04,106
Whatever, I should know whether there
is any information about our hospital.

1503
01:59:04,186 --> 01:59:05,895
Sure, sir, you will get
the information in 10 minutes.

1504
01:59:06,228 --> 01:59:08,311
Ok sir, this information
will be before you in 10 minutes.

1505
01:59:09,237 --> 01:59:10,353
Snigdha.
- Yes.

1506
01:59:10,569 --> 01:59:11,603
I told you right?

1507
01:59:12,169 --> 01:59:14,145
That character of Swathi is not bad.

1508
01:59:14,643 --> 01:59:16,020
Say it to your gang.
- Yes.

1509
01:59:16,511 --> 01:59:18,353
I will say it to my entire gang total.

1510
01:59:18,596 --> 01:59:24,478
Not just my gang, but to 420 aunty,
to 512 Padmaja aunty and will say to all.

1511
01:59:25,704 --> 01:59:26,853
Hey, listen wait.

1512
01:59:27,987 --> 01:59:30,561
What was the date Swathi died?

1513
01:59:30,772 --> 01:59:32,398
March 23rd
March 23rd?

1514
01:59:32,478 --> 01:59:33,853
I will just call you back.

1515
01:59:36,074 --> 01:59:38,395
she sent mail to Srinivas
even on the day she died?

1516
01:59:39,844 --> 01:59:42,520
Srinu... Srinu,
I got to talk with you Srinu.

1517
01:59:43,399 --> 01:59:45,728
I do not know whether I
will be alive till you come or no.

1518
01:59:47,135 --> 01:59:50,262
I never committed suicide
as you feared Srinu,

1519
01:59:50,483 --> 01:59:51,679
I do not even have so much courage.

1520
01:59:52,489 --> 01:59:59,387
But after those kids died in that accident,
those kids are visible everywhere I see.

1521
02:00:00,525 --> 02:00:03,682
I got so frustrated
that I overdosed myself.

1522
02:00:04,114 --> 02:00:06,345
You joined me then in the hospital.

1523
02:00:09,044 --> 02:00:11,223
Hi guys, this is our intensive care unit.

1524
02:00:11,379 --> 02:00:15,137
World best equipment
to give ultimate services!

1525
02:00:15,712 --> 02:00:20,096
One of our prime priorities
is our pediatric section.

1526
02:00:20,572 --> 02:00:24,264
Neo natal care and ICU equipments here are
nowhere else in our South India.

1527
02:00:24,472 --> 02:00:27,914
In whichever hospital there
is a critical condition for kids,

1528
02:00:27,994 --> 02:00:32,956
they immediately bring
only to our hospital

1529
02:00:36,226 --> 02:00:37,739
Please come...
- Doctor.

1530
02:00:39,019 --> 02:00:39,679
Yes.

1531
02:00:40,282 --> 02:00:45,152
Wherever there kids emergency in Hyderabad,
will they bring only to this hospital?

1532
02:00:45,325 --> 02:00:46,096
You are right,

1533
02:00:46,179 --> 02:00:48,456
hundreds of kids emergency
cases have come

1534
02:00:48,536 --> 02:00:51,304
to this hospitals
in the past three months.

1535
02:00:51,829 --> 02:00:56,821
Then few months back,
five kids in critical condition

1536
02:00:56,901 --> 02:01:01,498
were shifted in Ambulance from
this hospital to another hospital.

1537
02:01:08,424 --> 02:01:11,554
Say doctor, why did you shift?

1538
02:01:12,369 --> 02:01:15,059
That is... Nurse...
- Yes, sir.

1539
02:01:15,214 --> 02:01:16,637
Look after the patient.
- Ok, sir.

1540
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:20,012
Madam, you are in medication right?
You should not come like this.

1541
02:01:21,017 --> 02:01:22,804
Nurse, did you give Sedation?

1542
02:01:23,344 --> 02:01:24,179
Sir..

1543
02:01:24,929 --> 02:01:25,804
Sedate her.

1544
02:01:33,956 --> 02:01:38,221
You should not go so without
information madam, we will lose our jobs.

1545
02:01:55,304 --> 02:01:57,533
That is, I on that day...

1546
02:01:57,613 --> 02:02:01,262
Actually I am a new recruitment.
I do not correctly know about that.

1547
02:02:01,698 --> 02:02:06,554
My in charge would know and
I will call him, ok? Wait a moment.

1548
02:02:10,390 --> 02:02:11,168
Ok, sir.

1549
02:02:11,248 --> 02:02:11,834
Hello.

1550
02:02:11,914 --> 02:02:15,096
Sir, a lady came here and
is asking about the five kids.

1551
02:02:20,214 --> 02:02:23,698
You manage her for five minutes and
I will be there and do not let her go out.

1552
02:02:23,778 --> 02:02:25,221
Ok sir, I will manage.

1553
02:02:33,385 --> 02:02:34,429
What will you manage?

1554
02:02:34,762 --> 02:02:36,679
That is... That is...

1555
02:02:37,458 --> 02:02:38,846
You called for whom?

1556
02:02:44,931 --> 02:02:46,054
Say the truth.

1557
02:02:46,929 --> 02:02:48,304
I will kill if you do not say.

1558
02:02:48,529 --> 02:02:49,971
I will tell, I will.

1559
02:02:51,228 --> 02:02:53,096
That day power suddenly failed.

1560
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:58,596
Power backup works almost
for all the important sections.

1561
02:02:59,012 --> 02:03:03,262
But power backup did not work for
the ventilators in the kids section.

1562
02:03:03,846 --> 02:03:07,137
Though we complained many times
in advance, none cared about that.

1563
02:03:07,887 --> 02:03:13,304
As power backup did not work, those five
kids on ventilator died going breathless.

1564
02:03:24,284 --> 02:03:26,429
I did not kill those five kids Srinu.

1565
02:03:28,210 --> 02:03:29,512
They did not die in the accident.

1566
02:03:30,804 --> 02:03:32,262
They died in that hospital itself...

1567
02:03:33,114 --> 02:03:35,387
No, they killed.

1568
02:03:35,622 --> 02:03:39,230
As the hospital reputation will
be gone if it goes out that kids died

1569
02:03:39,310 --> 02:03:41,096
because of Management negligence,

1570
02:03:41,590 --> 02:03:43,668
they sent the kids out in
the ambulance with the break wire cut

1571
02:03:43,748 --> 02:03:45,971
even without the knowledge of driver.

1572
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:49,929
That Ambulance dashed
some car going on the road

1573
02:03:53,179 --> 02:03:56,971
They made all believe outside
that kids died because of that accident.

1574
02:04:01,673 --> 02:04:02,554
Where is she?

1575
02:04:05,262 --> 02:04:07,221
What happened? Where is that lady?

1576
02:04:09,387 --> 02:04:10,096
What?

1577
02:04:22,971 --> 02:04:25,766
Are the lives of small kids
who cannot open their mouth to say

1578
02:04:25,846 --> 02:04:27,512
the pain so cheap for you, rogue?

1579
02:04:33,471 --> 02:04:35,179
All these are common in a hospital right?

1580
02:04:36,137 --> 02:04:38,804
Power failed and back up did not work.
Just for that?

1581
02:04:39,137 --> 02:04:41,679
Not a coffee machine has stopped in the
coffee shop of this hospital.

1582
02:04:42,426 --> 02:04:44,262
No AC stopped in the VIP rooms.

1583
02:04:44,929 --> 02:04:47,262
Counting machine in the
payment section has not stopped.

1584
02:04:47,908 --> 02:04:52,512
But power stopped for the ventilators
in the kids section, why?

1585
02:04:53,831 --> 02:04:55,189
Yes, sir. We are coming there right now.

1586
02:04:55,812 --> 02:04:57,178
Okay, sir.

1587
02:05:05,878 --> 02:05:07,236
I will be there in a moment.

1588
02:05:08,619 --> 02:05:09,692
Sure.

1589
02:05:10,617 --> 02:05:11,690
Okay.

1590
02:05:37,137 --> 02:05:37,983
Done.

1591
02:05:41,001 --> 02:05:43,232
Move aside please. Give way.

1592
02:05:45,352 --> 02:05:49,346
Move aside please.
- Hello.. hey, open the lift.

1593
02:05:50,554 --> 02:05:53,091
No idea what injection
have they done Srinu.

1594
02:05:53,171 --> 02:05:55,637
But somehow I came home taking trouble

1595
02:05:58,637 --> 02:06:01,012
No idea whether I would live or die Srinu.

1596
02:06:03,091 --> 02:06:06,637
Five kids and hopes of five parents...

1597
02:06:07,795 --> 02:06:08,887
They killed, Srinu...

1598
02:06:11,929 --> 02:06:15,387
That Olympus hospital people should
not be let gone at all, Srinu.

1599
02:06:16,054 --> 02:06:20,346
They turned even hospitals like malls
and are doing a business.

1600
02:06:20,605 --> 02:06:22,512
They are playing with lives for money.

1601
02:06:22,879 --> 02:06:25,179
We should see to that such hospitals
should be taken off Srinu.

1602
02:06:25,259 --> 02:06:30,304
I expected she would do something like this
and thus asked to bring that hard disk.

1603
02:06:31,371 --> 02:06:32,804
By chance,
did she send this video to anybody?

1604
02:06:33,309 --> 02:06:35,766
According to the system key log file,
she has sent a mail, sir.

1605
02:06:35,846 --> 02:06:37,762
As for the information
in that mail is sent, sir.

1606
02:06:39,971 --> 02:06:41,637
Is it so messing with these Indian ladies?

1607
02:06:42,062 --> 02:06:45,512
They torture when alive
and are torturing even after dead.

1608
02:06:46,767 --> 02:06:47,887
Whom did she send the mail?

1609
02:06:48,315 --> 02:06:50,096
I think...
She sent to her husband Srinivas, sir.

1610
02:06:50,304 --> 02:06:51,637
But he still did not open the mail.

1611
02:06:52,637 --> 02:06:55,929
As he is still in the jail,
no chance for him to open that mail still.

1612
02:06:56,846 --> 02:07:00,492
That video should not exist in
the mails of these both. Can we delete?

1613
02:07:00,572 --> 02:07:02,929
Well that is a very easy process, sir.
First we have to get...

1614
02:07:04,756 --> 02:07:06,278
I will hack those two mails

1615
02:07:06,358 --> 02:07:08,804
and delete that video
from not being seen anywhere else, sir.

1616
02:07:09,141 --> 02:07:09,804
Do it.

1617
02:07:11,139 --> 02:07:13,929
Jeeva, Srinivas has not killed Swathi.

1618
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:18,429
Who killed Swathi are
those Olympus hospital people.

1619
02:07:19,667 --> 02:07:20,471
How do you know?

1620
02:07:20,852 --> 02:07:22,887
I came to know all this seeing
the video in mails of Swathi.

1621
02:07:30,762 --> 02:07:37,762
Jeeva, then are you not killing me?
Then, is someone else killing me?

1622
02:07:38,364 --> 02:07:41,387
That is... I will just call you.

1623
02:07:42,627 --> 02:07:44,304
Puppy, did he say the
address of that second car?

1624
02:07:44,642 --> 02:07:45,387
Yes, bro.

1625
02:07:45,559 --> 02:07:46,096
Who is that?

1626
02:07:46,363 --> 02:07:48,837
That is... That is...

1627
02:07:48,917 --> 02:07:50,012
Come on, say Puppy.

1628
02:07:51,336 --> 02:07:53,054
It belongs to the Hospital
MD TSS Tarun again.

1629
02:07:56,762 --> 02:07:59,971
I did not ask about 7777,
but whose is the black Benz 9999.

1630
02:08:00,179 --> 02:08:04,346
Yes bro, even that Benz car belongs to
Olympus hospital MD TSS Tarun.

1631
02:08:07,189 --> 02:08:08,797
Both those cars are of him.

1632
02:08:17,093 --> 02:08:19,137
There is a reason for that
hospital MD to kill Swathi.

1633
02:08:19,722 --> 02:08:21,887
But why will he kill Jo with no relation?

1634
02:08:23,458 --> 02:08:28,035
Delete! I hacked both
mails and deleted the video.

1635
02:08:28,115 --> 02:08:29,702
Now you cannot get
the video even if you want.

1636
02:08:29,953 --> 02:08:30,554
Good.

1637
02:08:30,853 --> 02:08:31,804
One minute, sir.

1638
02:08:32,306 --> 02:08:32,929
What?

1639
02:08:33,221 --> 02:08:35,509
Someone opened the mail id of
Swathi one minute before

1640
02:08:35,589 --> 02:08:37,221
we opened and downloaded the video, sir.

1641
02:08:40,964 --> 02:08:41,762
Who is that?

1642
02:08:41,846 --> 02:08:43,846
We should know, sir.
- Know it.

1643
02:08:44,033 --> 02:08:46,012
That is very simple task sir, we can...

1644
02:08:46,792 --> 02:08:48,846
You are forgetting the
mother tongue Mr. James.

1645
02:08:49,136 --> 02:08:50,217
I will get to know and say, sir.

1646
02:08:50,297 --> 02:08:55,249
Hey, I need their name,
city, area and all details.

1647
02:09:20,467 --> 02:09:23,387
Sir, who opened mail id of Swathi
and saw the video is a lady, sir.

1648
02:09:25,311 --> 02:09:28,554
Name is Jyotsna, block B Sobha
Althia apartments, Banjara Hills.

1649
02:09:29,177 --> 02:09:30,762
Sir, even Swathi is
from the same apartments.

1650
02:09:31,166 --> 02:09:34,012
What is the relation
between this girl and her?

1651
02:09:34,092 --> 02:09:35,179
This fellow will say sir.

1652
02:09:43,681 --> 02:09:44,303
Who is that fellow?

1653
02:09:44,383 --> 02:09:46,221
We got that girl killed
by this fellow, sir.

1654
02:09:46,863 --> 02:09:47,581
Then this fellow?

1655
02:09:47,661 --> 02:09:49,679
This fellow was caught
following that fellow, sir.

1656
02:09:49,929 --> 02:09:51,346
Why did he bring him here?

1657
02:09:51,637 --> 02:09:53,365
He knows the real story, sir.

1658
02:09:53,445 --> 02:09:55,429
No, real story and..
- Hey, say idiot.

1659
02:09:55,512 --> 02:09:57,138
None knows the real story, sir.

1660
02:09:57,218 --> 02:09:59,724
What I know too is he saying
C, C++ that day and...

1661
02:09:59,804 --> 02:10:00,718
Shut up!

1662
02:10:01,512 --> 02:10:04,804
What is the relation between
dead Swathi and Jyotsna?

1663
02:10:05,993 --> 02:10:07,606
I think this fellow
is English Medium candidate

1664
02:10:07,686 --> 02:10:09,012
and let me convince saying in English.

1665
02:10:10,204 --> 02:10:13,054
To the respected rich educated, sir.

1666
02:10:14,996 --> 02:10:16,846
I studied seventh class only.

1667
02:10:17,512 --> 02:10:19,554
But I learned English lonely.

1668
02:10:20,679 --> 02:10:22,179
Can I have the water Kinley?

1669
02:10:22,387 --> 02:10:23,262
He is dead.

1670
02:10:23,671 --> 02:10:24,709
It is yours faithfully.

1671
02:10:26,429 --> 02:10:27,846
Why do you hit speaking I English, sir?

1672
02:10:28,229 --> 02:10:32,262
That is actually, sir. And English...
- Sir knows, but he loves Telugu.

1673
02:10:33,168 --> 02:10:33,929
Oh, he knows.

1674
02:10:35,053 --> 02:10:38,512
Sir, do you know the relation in between
Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy?

1675
02:10:39,887 --> 02:10:41,721
This is not English but their names, sir.

1676
02:10:41,804 --> 02:10:43,451
When asked about the relation
between Swathi and Jyotsna,

1677
02:10:43,531 --> 02:10:44,804
why do you say about someone?

1678
02:10:45,717 --> 02:10:48,054
Clarity will come in the story
only when said from there, sir.

1679
02:10:49,137 --> 02:10:52,221
Say it all without missing out even
one detail from what you know.

1680
02:10:57,478 --> 02:11:00,227
They killed Swathi as she knew that
those kids died in the hospital itself.

1681
02:11:01,519 --> 02:11:02,769
Now even Jo came to know that.

1682
02:11:03,654 --> 02:11:06,144
That mens,
will they kill even Jo for the same.

1683
02:11:07,185 --> 02:11:08,060
What bro?

1684
02:11:09,102 --> 02:11:11,435
Yes, they will kill even Jo for the same.

1685
02:11:11,519 --> 02:11:12,269
When bro?

1686
02:11:35,879 --> 02:11:40,510
If you say no, never
and try to change the destiny,

1687
02:11:40,590 --> 02:11:43,896
incidents to happen long
after too will come faster.

1688
02:11:49,562 --> 02:11:49,980
Hello

1689
02:11:50,060 --> 02:11:51,227
Jo, what are you doing?

1690
02:11:51,439 --> 02:11:54,394
I am in front of the laptop Jeeva,
I am copying video of Swathi to pen drive

1691
02:11:56,136 --> 02:11:59,560
She is doing something
sitting in front of the computer.

1692
02:12:00,477 --> 02:12:02,102
Jo, leave immediately from there.

1693
02:12:02,355 --> 02:12:02,894
What?

1694
02:12:03,102 --> 02:12:04,249
First, leave from there.

1695
02:12:05,270 --> 02:12:06,810
Jeeva why, what happened?

1696
02:12:07,102 --> 02:12:07,977
Listen to what I said.

1697
02:12:08,852 --> 02:12:10,894
Just few more seconds Jeeva,
copying is almost done.

1698
02:12:11,246 --> 02:12:12,769
First, leave from there.

1699
02:12:16,979 --> 02:12:18,352
Done! Ok, fine.

1700
02:12:46,204 --> 02:12:49,227
Hello, hey my car... Hey...

1701
02:12:57,317 --> 02:12:58,744
Hey, did you say at home and come?

1702
02:13:01,394 --> 02:13:03,310
What is that look, you bald idiot?

1703
02:13:08,154 --> 02:13:11,519
Jo... Jo... Jo, are you ok?

1704
02:13:11,599 --> 02:13:13,810
Jeeva, someone is following me.

1705
02:13:16,422 --> 02:13:18,435
Not knowing why they are following.

1706
02:13:21,213 --> 02:13:22,939
Jo, listen to me and relax. Where are you?

1707
02:13:23,019 --> 02:13:25,935
I took car of someone
from cellar and escaped.

1708
02:13:26,437 --> 02:13:27,144
Car?

1709
02:13:32,519 --> 02:13:35,269
No, why are you driving the car Jo?
- Not knowing what to do Jeeva.

1710
02:13:36,020 --> 02:13:38,060
I am driving after a very long time.

1711
02:13:40,251 --> 02:13:43,235
I am frightened Jeeva.
It is raining heavily too.

1712
02:13:43,435 --> 02:13:46,644
It is raining heavily Srinu,
I am also frightened.

1713
02:13:46,727 --> 02:13:47,602
Jo, calm down.

1714
02:13:47,792 --> 02:13:49,185
You immediately go to
the Police station nearby.

1715
02:13:49,310 --> 02:13:50,272
Where are you now?

1716
02:13:50,352 --> 02:13:52,310
I am nearby the clock tower in Gachibowli.

1717
02:13:56,685 --> 02:13:58,120
Gachibowli clock tower?

1718
02:14:21,842 --> 02:14:22,977
Put the hand over the hand break.

1719
02:14:23,352 --> 02:14:23,852
Jeeva.

1720
02:14:23,977 --> 02:14:25,769
Put the hand over hand
break and take to the right.

1721
02:14:26,046 --> 02:14:27,644
Jeeva, Police station is on the left.

1722
02:14:27,769 --> 02:14:28,810
Jo, do what I said.

1723
02:14:33,935 --> 02:14:35,185
Right... hand break...

1724
02:14:58,401 --> 02:14:59,664
That was a car.

1725
02:14:59,744 --> 02:15:01,696
Just missed.

1726
02:15:05,199 --> 02:15:07,369
Jo, are you ok?

1727
02:15:07,949 --> 02:15:08,641
Jo...

1728
02:15:10,301 --> 02:15:11,259
I am alright Jeeva.

1729
02:15:11,884 --> 02:15:13,129
Jo!

1730
02:15:28,488 --> 02:15:33,426
Hey, what is this accident? Just
a normal accident, not much of a kick.

1731
02:15:35,079 --> 02:15:43,051
Have Ivanka matter in headline
and put this matter down under sub line.

1732
02:15:43,666 --> 02:15:44,759
This is..

1733
02:15:45,509 --> 02:15:46,968
Brother, accident...
- Ok, see you then.

1734
02:15:47,307 --> 02:15:51,509
Yes, it happened. What is the use?
Not even one died and added...

1735
02:15:52,393 --> 02:15:53,968
You hit Eluru Seenu?

1736
02:15:54,322 --> 02:15:55,384
PRO Eluru Seenu?

1737
02:15:56,665 --> 02:15:58,593
I will teach you a lesson
when you come to Eluru.

1738
02:15:59,217 --> 02:16:00,176
Where is the girl?

1739
02:16:00,454 --> 02:16:01,968
They took her to hospital in Ambulance.

1740
02:16:02,048 --> 02:16:03,926
Ambulance? Which hospital Ambulance?

1741
02:16:04,006 --> 02:16:06,499
That is... Yes, Olympus hospital.

1742
02:16:07,588 --> 02:16:08,551
Olympus?

1743
02:16:14,368 --> 02:16:15,484
Oh no, damn!

1744
02:16:20,025 --> 02:16:22,009
What bro, where are you?

1745
02:16:23,251 --> 02:16:26,321
Where would you be? You would
be at the Gachibowli clock tower.

1746
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:28,634
But your Jo is not there, right?

1747
02:16:29,115 --> 02:16:31,378
When ant was asked why I bit,

1748
02:16:31,458 --> 02:16:33,801
it seems ant said will I not if finger is
put in my golden nest?

1749
02:16:34,426 --> 02:16:37,009
And your Jo has put her
head directly into my nest.

1750
02:16:37,608 --> 02:16:40,134
I should kill, right?
Thus I am killing her.

1751
02:16:40,968 --> 02:16:45,343
Yes idiot, I know that there would
seven similar humans but this pa...

1752
02:16:45,946 --> 02:16:47,736
What is that Varma?
- Parallel life, sir.

1753
02:16:47,816 --> 02:16:48,968
Yes, the same...

1754
02:16:49,189 --> 02:16:50,468
I am just listening to it.

1755
02:16:50,948 --> 02:16:54,115
I should kill your Jo even
looking from that angle right?

1756
02:16:55,490 --> 02:16:59,573
It seems you are trying very hard
to save the girl and change the destiny?

1757
02:17:00,078 --> 02:17:02,406
I encourage those working hard,
a lot brother.

1758
02:17:03,312 --> 02:17:04,115
Try hard...

1759
02:17:04,670 --> 02:17:07,115
We are constructing a new branch of
our hospital in Jubilee hills.

1760
02:17:07,473 --> 02:17:10,615
Come there and try hard to save her.

1761
02:17:10,906 --> 02:17:11,865
Ok?

1762
02:17:58,594 --> 02:17:59,223
Hello.

1763
02:17:59,303 --> 02:18:00,323
Is everything ok?

1764
02:18:00,403 --> 02:18:02,531
I gave the injection,
she is down in sedation.

1765
02:18:02,780 --> 02:18:08,047
He too is coming and timing would be
perfect. Kill her and inform the Police.

1766
02:18:12,666 --> 02:18:13,740
Hey...

1767
02:18:36,111 --> 02:18:36,948
Where?

1768
02:19:58,837 --> 02:20:00,448
Hey, look about that fellow.

1769
02:20:11,533 --> 02:20:13,193
Jo,

1770
02:20:14,646 --> 02:20:15,666
Jeeva...
- Jo.

1771
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:19,808
Hey, open it idiot

1772
02:20:24,948 --> 02:20:26,698
Jo, open the door

1773
02:20:27,661 --> 02:20:29,406
Jo, open the door

1774
02:21:06,554 --> 02:21:07,834
Hey...

1775
02:21:11,531 --> 02:21:13,006
Jo!

1776
02:21:13,214 --> 02:21:15,125
We won't change the destiny...

1777
02:21:15,428 --> 02:21:16,760
that's it.

1778
02:21:27,319 --> 02:21:28,426
Hey...

1779
02:21:41,406 --> 02:21:42,230
No..

1780
02:21:44,712 --> 02:21:46,406
Puppy, did you start?

1781
02:21:46,710 --> 02:21:50,115
I started bro,
I will be there in 15 minutes.

1782
02:21:51,406 --> 02:21:52,823
Puppy, give the phone to doctor.

1783
02:21:52,948 --> 02:21:53,781
What happened to Jo, bro?

1784
02:21:54,009 --> 02:21:55,156
Give the phone to doctor.

1785
02:21:56,223 --> 02:21:57,490
Who?
- Come on speak, sir.

1786
02:21:57,719 --> 02:21:58,368
Hello.

1787
02:21:58,448 --> 02:22:00,767
Doctor, neck is cut and blood is going.

1788
02:22:00,847 --> 02:22:02,490
What to do for Jo to
be alive till you come?

1789
02:22:02,570 --> 02:22:05,281
What, is the neck cut?
- What should I do?

1790
02:22:05,406 --> 02:22:09,031
Ok, make the patient lie on a flat surface

1791
02:22:15,615 --> 02:22:16,906
Doctor, blood is going.

1792
02:22:16,990 --> 02:22:19,076
Stop the bleeding from
the place where it is cut.

1793
02:22:19,156 --> 02:22:20,490
If not...
- I will stop it.

1794
02:22:27,490 --> 02:22:28,789
Next, what to do next?

1795
02:22:28,869 --> 02:22:30,391
Pulse, check the pulse

1796
02:22:30,884 --> 02:22:31,940
Pulse...!

1797
02:22:41,367 --> 02:22:42,188
Pulse is low doctor.

1798
02:22:42,268 --> 02:22:44,704
Where ever you are in the building,
come to the gate,

1799
02:22:44,784 --> 02:22:46,609
every second from here is valuable.

1800
02:22:46,764 --> 02:22:47,456
Ok doctor.

1801
02:22:47,536 --> 02:22:51,490
One second, at no cost should
the patient go unconscious.

1802
02:22:51,669 --> 02:22:53,656
It is like the life is
gone if she goes unconscious.

1803
02:22:53,736 --> 02:22:56,490
Take care that the girl
does not get unconscious.

1804
02:22:56,615 --> 02:22:57,365
Ok, doctor.

1805
02:22:57,948 --> 02:22:59,156
Jo.

1806
02:23:00,776 --> 02:23:02,566
Get up Jo, open your eyes.

1807
02:23:02,869 --> 02:23:03,915
Jo, please.

1808
02:23:03,995 --> 02:23:05,156
Open your eyes.

1809
02:23:05,428 --> 02:23:07,333
Police will be coming.

1810
02:23:07,413 --> 02:23:10,315
And I am not allowing
you to leave me like this.

1811
02:23:10,817 --> 02:23:13,922
Puppy they will not leave us so easily.

1812
02:23:14,002 --> 02:23:16,127
Just one way for Jo not
to go unconscious till then.

1813
02:23:16,207 --> 02:23:17,413
What bro..?

1814
02:23:18,384 --> 02:23:19,447
Understood?

1815
02:23:19,527 --> 02:23:20,641
Okay.

1816
02:23:22,015 --> 02:23:26,223
We will marry,
we will have kids and buy a house too Jo.

1817
02:23:26,790 --> 02:23:29,437
Get up, do not leave me and go Jo.

1818
02:23:47,306 --> 02:23:48,223
Jo...

1819
02:23:49,457 --> 02:23:51,848
You gave number without asking, ok.

1820
02:23:52,536 --> 02:23:54,848
You came to my house without asking, ok.

1821
02:23:55,693 --> 02:23:58,502
Now, if you go without
asking I will not stay calm

1822
02:23:58,582 --> 02:24:00,348
because you are the girl I loved.

1823
02:24:03,806 --> 02:24:06,598
Five... Just be patient
for five minutes Jo.

1824
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:09,556
Fight with death for me.

1825
02:24:10,178 --> 02:24:11,640
Fight for our love.

1826
02:24:11,848 --> 02:24:14,056
It should be decided today
whether it is our love or the destiny.

1827
02:24:17,312 --> 02:24:18,238
Let us finalise.

1828
02:24:19,414 --> 02:24:21,473
Puppy, you keep talking

1829
02:24:21,810 --> 02:24:22,556
Okay.

1830
02:24:24,556 --> 02:24:26,640
Hello Jo, it is me Puppy.

1831
02:24:26,806 --> 02:24:28,390
Nothing will happen to you Jo,
nothing will happen.

1832
02:24:33,433 --> 02:24:36,681
Jo, first time when your
sister introduced me to you,

1833
02:24:36,892 --> 02:24:40,032
you asked is this the waste
fellow you loved, do you remember?

1834
02:24:41,015 --> 02:24:42,515
I heard that right then Jo,

1835
02:24:42,598 --> 02:24:44,181
I thought to strongly ask you right then.

1836
02:24:44,723 --> 02:24:46,873
You know Jo right I do
not have that much of a scene.

1837
02:24:55,193 --> 02:24:56,640
Jo, shall I say one thing?

1838
02:24:56,806 --> 02:25:00,348
When your sister said me about you,
I asked do we still need children Jo.

1839
02:25:08,271 --> 02:25:10,765
Will you ask your sister if needed?
Wait, be on the line.

1840
02:25:13,640 --> 02:25:15,765
Hey Jo, how are you dear?

1841
02:25:16,617 --> 02:25:18,681
You tortured me till I
made your brother in law say ok.

1842
02:25:19,194 --> 02:25:21,443
Did you forget us after I made him say ok?

1843
02:25:28,205 --> 02:25:30,598
You said to need a boy
to play with the baby right?

1844
02:25:30,890 --> 02:25:34,681
Oh no, this fellow is
kicking a lot in the stomach.

1845
02:25:35,271 --> 02:25:36,681
Next week is the delivery date.

1846
02:25:37,390 --> 02:25:40,473
You know that I fear a lot about hospitals
and injections right?

1847
02:25:41,348 --> 02:25:44,681
You said to be beside me right?
When are you coming?

1848
02:26:00,155 --> 02:26:04,056
What Jo, why are you not sending
WhatsApp messages to phone of my son?

1849
02:26:09,306 --> 02:26:11,984
Jo, it seems you said with my son
that you okayed him only

1850
02:26:12,064 --> 02:26:13,806
after seeing his family right?

1851
02:26:14,434 --> 02:26:17,848
And how can you leaving our family.

1852
02:26:19,104 --> 02:26:20,176
Bharani...

1853
02:26:32,931 --> 02:26:33,556
Jo,

1854
02:26:35,306 --> 02:26:36,223
Nothing will happen to you Jo.

1855
02:26:37,051 --> 02:26:39,056
Nothing will happen to you, I am saying.

1856
02:26:39,431 --> 02:26:44,640
There is a power greater than science
and astrology in this Universe

1857
02:26:46,391 --> 02:26:51,890
That is nowhere else Jo. It is in you,
me, in Jeeva and in everyone.

1858
02:26:55,896 --> 02:26:58,390
Jo, one moment... Just one moment...

1859
02:26:59,390 --> 02:27:01,765
Wish strongly in heart
that you should live.

1860
02:27:02,390 --> 02:27:06,098
That power will surely come in your
support in that one moment.

1861
02:27:08,973 --> 02:27:09,916
Wish Jo...

1862
02:27:13,133 --> 02:27:15,348
Wish to live for the man you loved Jo...

1863
02:27:16,627 --> 02:27:18,640
Wish to live for all of us.

1864
02:27:25,449 --> 02:27:26,598
You will live Jo...

1865
02:27:27,992 --> 02:27:29,125
Wish for it, Jo.

1866
02:27:30,378 --> 02:27:31,148
You will live, Jo.

1867
02:28:24,295 --> 02:28:27,374
You will survive.

1868
02:28:38,159 --> 02:28:39,164
I should live...

1869
02:28:40,776 --> 02:28:44,039
I should live for the guy I loved...

1870
02:28:44,205 --> 02:28:46,578
I will live...

1871
02:28:46,658 --> 02:28:51,630
I will live for sure...

1872
02:29:19,474 --> 02:29:21,006
Should show what the power of media is...

1873
02:29:22,552 --> 02:29:25,849
Five kids who died in accident a few days
were actually dead in the hospital

1874
02:29:26,033 --> 02:29:29,141
itself because of Management negligence

1875
02:29:29,349 --> 02:29:34,016
and it is proved that they played
the accident drama to cover that up.

1876
02:29:34,390 --> 02:29:36,998
All this came to light from
the video recorded by Swathi,

1877
02:29:37,078 --> 02:29:39,183
victim of that accident
recorded before her death.

1878
02:29:39,579 --> 02:29:41,933
Getting to know that many
more dreaded things are on,

1879
02:29:42,217 --> 02:29:45,516
that hospital is completely
seized under the supervision of NABH.

1880
02:29:51,828 --> 02:29:54,974
Brother, home or shall we go to the bar?

1881
02:29:55,406 --> 02:29:56,595
To Inorbit mall

1882
02:29:57,460 --> 02:29:58,349
Again to the mall?

1883
02:29:58,736 --> 02:30:00,552
Send me inside, I will go in.
