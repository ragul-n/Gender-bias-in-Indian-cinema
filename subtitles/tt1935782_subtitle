1
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:11,291
TWO CENTS FOR THE SUNSHINE,

2
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:14,583
FOUR CENTS FOR THE RAIN.

3
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,708
He is our salable hero...

4
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,541
Don't worry.
I will talk to you later.

5
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,875
-Sir, I have written something new.
-Wonderful! Let me hear it.

6
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,500
"Once the rain is here...
Once the rain is here...

7
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,750
All the pain vanishes

8
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:13,000
Once the rain is here...
It's a new beginning

9
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,583
In winter...

10
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,583
In winter...
I sell warmth...

11
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,750
Little by little"

12
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:24,541
Good.

13
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,666
-"I sell seasons--"
-Very good, Debu.

14
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,708
But the problem is...
you write sincerely.

15
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,083
Come up with a
contemporary theme.

16
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,583
Write a flamboyant song.

17
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,416
Do you know what everyone likes today?

18
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,958
Come here and kiss me...

19
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,250
Come here and touch me...

20
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,666
Come here and love me...

21
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,625
That's called a song.

22
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,083
Sir, I want to convey something...

23
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,416
through my songs.

24
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,708
Yes, go ahead with it.

25
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,083
But write something that will
be played in an auto-rickshaw!

26
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,583
I am going back home.

27
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,958
Don't try to look for me.

28
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,666
Let me go in.
I stay here, as well.

29
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,541
-Who paid the rent?
-Yes. But...

30
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,625
Your boyfriend.

31
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,875
Who had the keys?
Sameer.

32
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,916
Yes, I'll talk about it.
It is raining.

33
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:52,750
Can I leave the suitcase...
and the guitar here?

34
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,541
Alright. Don't leave it
here for more than two days.

35
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,166
I got in first.

36
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,291
I didn't see you.

37
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,583
Now that you have seen me.
Get lost.

38
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,083
Well...

39
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,583
but... it is raining.

40
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,250
Just a minute!
Where do you have to go?

41
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,500
Where are you going?

42
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,916
I see.
You want a good time?

43
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,416
Yes.

44
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,666
But I will stop on the
way for 30 minutes.

45
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,875
Come on, Bankey.
Let's go to our hotel.

46
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,416
I am reaching, Sallu!

47
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:29,041
Wait, sir.
Let the rain stop.

48
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,375
Do you have a condom?

49
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,000
I am paying you for the job, right?

50
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,791
I've told you many times before
that I can't do without it.

51
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:05,958
-Here you go.
-Great!

52
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,083
This is funny.

53
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,625
You want to get wet in the rain

54
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,625
but you want to wear a raincoat!

55
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,666
If you want to come out in the rain,
you'll have to wear a raincoat.

56
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,166
Forget all this!

57
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,333
If you're okay with AIDS,
I'm okay with it too.

58
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,750
Why do you scare me?
I am here to stay.

59
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,125
Anyway,
you're going to enjoy it.

60
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,250
I am not here for enjoyment.
Are you wearing it or not?

61
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,250
I'm running late. I have someone
else is sitting in the taxi.

62
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:40,250
I see. You've started a
call-waiting facility, as well?

63
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,541
-You've become very smart.
-You rascal!

64
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,708
-Would you like to hear some lyrics?
-At your command!

65
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,500
Wow! Which place do you belong to?

66
00:09:56,041 --> 00:10:00,000
Originally, I am from Lucknow.
But now I belong to Mumbai.

67
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,291
I see.

68
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,000
"In the empty
receptacles of my heart

69
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:09,958
I found...
some forgotten coins"

70
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,166
"In the empty
receptacles of my heart

71
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,708
-I found some forgotten coins"
-I found some forgotten coins"

72
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,666
-"Sometimes...
-Okay.

73
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,541
sometimes you will find happiness"

74
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,166
Is there enough place to sit?

75
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,041
I had one...

76
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,958
but now, I'll have to make
some other arrangement.

77
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,750
-Bankey... let's go home.
-Yes, ma'am!

78
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,833
Do you have money?

79
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,208
Yes, I have 375 rupees!

80
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,125
When the bank opens tomorrow--

81
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,791
Hey! What are you doing in my taxi?

82
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,583
Throw him out, Bankey!

83
00:10:55,666 --> 00:11:00,166
-Bloody rascal!
-Please get down, sir. We need to go.

84
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,708
What did you do today?

85
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,416
The maid didn't come today, as well?

86
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,625
What's this?
Didn't you eat your food?

87
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,375
Why do you behave like this?
Okay, stay hungry.

88
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,291
I earn the money
and you waste it!

89
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,416
The cat is here again!

90
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,625
Looking after you is
already hard for me.

91
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,041
I can't take care
of this cat now.

92
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,625
Let her go.
Leave her.

93
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,458
I don't want to see it
in this house again.

94
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,083
How are you Kaku?

95
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,083
Is this the time to come?

96
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,791
I went out and finished my chores.
And you are coming now?

97
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,916
He is hungry and thirsty.

98
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,083
What can I do, ma'am?
I don't have the time.

99
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,916
The lady on the fourth floor
has no maid at home.

100
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,000
I work there as a substitute maid.

101
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,458
Will you starve my child
for your substitute job?

102
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,833
Leave that job and work here.

103
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:40,166
How can I leave that place?
I get more money there.

104
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,416
Do I not pay you?
Stop your daily theatrics.

105
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,666
If you want me to work, it's fine.
Or else I will leave.

106
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,708
Okay, go!

107
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,083
Here's your key. Clear my account.
I won't come from tomorrow.

108
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,875
Even I don't want
your daily theatrics!

109
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,416
You can leave just now. Go!
Who do you think you are?

110
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,625
Don't come back.
Do you understand?

111
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,916
Don't ever ask me to come back.

112
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,583
-I won't.
-Okay.

113
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,625
You think I can't do without you?

114
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:07,958
Bihari!

115
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,041
Bihari... this maid won't
come here anymore.

116
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,291
I need a new maid from tomorrow.

117
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,833
But it's difficult to
find a reliable maid.

118
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,416
I'll look for one tomorrow.

119
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,375
Hurry up! Find me one at the earliest.

120
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,333
Okay, I will try.

121
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,833
Sir, please place an order.
The cafe will be closed in some time.

122
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,750
I am coming.
Here I am.

123
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:42,708
Hold it.

124
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:43,750
Eat this.

125
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,708
Don't make me shout at you.

126
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,041
-You needed a maid.
-Yes!

127
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,583
-There's one here.
-Call her.

128
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,791
Come!

129
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You? You're still here?

130
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,166
I had asked for a
maid not a male.

131
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,625
A child has to be looked after.
What will this Mr. Fantoosh do?

132
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:29,625
Get lost!

133
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,875
I'll do anything.
I need work.

134
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,041
This is Kaku.

135
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,083
He can't do anything on his own.

136
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,458
Neither can he bathe, nor change his
clothes or go to the bathroom on his own.

137
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,416
He needs to be carried to the potty-chair!
Do you understand?

138
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,166
-Leave! Get out!
-Listen to me.

139
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,958
Yes... I know.

140
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:01,833
Where are you going?

141
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Why? Any problem?

142
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,375
You think you own this hotel?

143
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,708
Why are you stopping everybody?

144
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,375
Not everybody...
but I have to stop some people.

145
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,041
Asshole!

146
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,500
What is this, Sallu? He didn't
let me in, bloody catamite!

147
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,875
Where did you go?

148
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,916
You told me to come to a five-star
hotel in Bandra. That's where I am.

149
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,208
Are you crazy? I didn't tell you
to be at a five-star hotel.

150
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,583
I told you to be at Hotel Five Star.

151
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,625
That's what it's called.
It's in Juhu.

152
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,291
Forget it.
I'll send someone else.

153
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,041
How much will you take?

154
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,208
Who do you think you are?

155
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,041
What? What did you say?

156
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:44,750
Damn you!

157
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,250
She has also raised her rate.

158
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,333
Hey... get the beer.

159
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,500
He's so lazy to put
his hand in his pocket!

160
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,500
Hey!
You're here again?

161
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,291
Why are you speaking like me?

162
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,500
Don't try to look for me.

163
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,208
He ended a three and a
half year relationship...

164
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,791
in just three and a half lines.

165
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,250
I can cook, handle the child
and look after the house.

166
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,833
You don't need to be worried.

167
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,625
I am there.

168
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,500
Unemployed.

169
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,666
I have no money and I have no work.

170
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,875
I just need a shelter.

171
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:31,083
How can I trust you?
Do I know you?

172
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,208
I don't know who you are.

173
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,083
What if you run
away with my child?

174
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,500
Kids are getting kidnapped nowadays.

175
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,583
He who doesn't have
a place to live...

176
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,166
cannot kidnap your disabled child.

177
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:00,875
What do you do?

178
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,583
I am unemployed for now.

179
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,833
-Okay.
-Otherwise, I am a songwriter.

180
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,125
I write songs.

181
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:15,875
Film songs?

182
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,041
Hey! Move.

183
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,958
You're quite a guy!

184
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,125
Which songs have you written?

185
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,250
Well, I've written many songs...

186
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,541
but none have come out yet.

187
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:35,916
It is a matter of luck.

188
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,958
Either the producer
didn't like what I wrote...

189
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,541
or the film got stalled.

190
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,458
-Come on! Sing me a song.
-Here?

191
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,208
Yes! It's a perfect filmy scene.

192
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,708
You're trying to bemoan
your grief anyway.

193
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:56,916
So, why don't you sing a song?
I love old songs.

194
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,291
Come on!

195
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:05,083
The day somehow passes

196
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:10,500
But night is endless

197
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:14,791
You don't come, but...

198
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:20,125
Your memories haunt me

199
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,041
The day somehow passes

200
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:28,458
The same drizzle and shower

201
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:33,208
It was raining in the same way

202
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:40,583
It was raining in the same way

203
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,083
Is this all the luggage you have?

204
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,750
I have another bag...
and a guitar.

205
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,833
I'll go get it.

206
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:53,833
Please bring it to me.

207
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,500
Come on in.

208
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,166
-Yes, okay.
-Come!

209
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,958
Had a tiff with your girlfriend?

210
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:00,916
What does she think of herself?

211
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,041
-Don't worry!
-What is this?

212
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:13,583
He is just a child.
He won't come in here. Come on!

213
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,458
I can't do this.

214
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:38,041
He has ruined my mood!
Son of a bitch!

215
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:43,041
Hey! What did you say?
You're a son of a bitch.

216
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:46,208
I will cut you up, if you say
anything against my child!

217
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,833
And don't you stare
at me like this!

218
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:56,583
Like your father!

219
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,458
I have to do this for you!

220
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,458
Had you not been born like this,
your father wouldn't have run away!

221
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:54,041
What's your name?

222
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:00,250
Do you like music?

223
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:01,958
I have a guitar...

224
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:04,083
and I can play it.

225
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:06,416
Would you like to learn?

226
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:20,250
In the orchards of dreams

227
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:27,583
Life will blossom

228
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,916
If you seek

229
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:40,416
You will find life again!

230
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:49,333
You will find life again!

231
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:57,833
In the orchards of dreams
Life will blossom

232
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,750
If you seek

233
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:07,000
You will find life again!

234
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:37,625
I'm coming!

235
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,000
It's his signal when he
wants to go to the potty.

236
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,416
When he wants to pee,
it's a different signal.

237
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:09,333
We have different signals for every need.

238
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,291
You'll learn it all.

239
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:46,583
What a mess!
How does she live here?

240
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,708
I want tea leaves...

241
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:07,083
tea leaves...

242
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:15,291
In the empty receptacles of my heart

243
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:19,458
I found some forgotten coins

244
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:22,041
Just by chance

245
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,541
You will find happiness

246
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,416
If you seek

247
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:35,958
You will find life again!

248
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:40,250
If you seek

249
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:44,291
You will find life again!

250
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:49,125
Listen, please feed Kaku at eight o'clock.
And put him to bed.

251
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,416
He always stays up late.

252
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:55,541
And before putting him to bed...
make sure he goes to pee.

253
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:01,416
Oh, my heart!
It is difficult to survive here

254
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,291
Stay off and be cautious
This is Bombay... my love!

255
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:50,416
Come on.

256
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:13,083
On the solitary path of love
Two strangers

257
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,041
Two strangers
Meet by chance

258
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:24,500
Just like that
You will find a smile

259
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:29,083
If you seek

260
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:34,166
You will find happiness

261
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:38,041
If you seek

262
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:42,208
You will find happiness

263
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:48,625
What's this, Sallu?

264
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:52,958
You're promoting new girls these days!

265
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:55,333
What about me?

266
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:58,666
I have a family.

267
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:00,375
You know that I have a child.

268
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:04,125
How will I survive without work?

269
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:06,208
What's wrong with you?

270
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,166
You do not understand it, Juhi.

271
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:12,083
Your time is over.

272
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:15,083
You look old!

273
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:17,291
How long can I drag this?

274
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:20,166
Who will give you so much of money?

275
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,416
Reduce your rate and I
will bring customers to you.

276
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:32,791
2,500 rupees for a good time.
Fix it... come on.

277
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:35,250
I won't work for peanuts.
Got it?

278
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,083
Don't hold yourself
at a premium, Juhi!

279
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:48,666
When I mention about you, the customer
says, "Sallu, she is old stuff.

280
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,250
Bring some fresh splendor!"

281
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:56,375
Five thousand... is too much.

282
00:32:56,833 --> 00:33:00,375
You can get a young girl for that price.

283
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:03,916
Yes, Vasu.

284
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:09,333
Yes, I have. What do you want?
Come on, say it.

285
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:13,666
You will get it!
Absolutely fresh!

286
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:20,333
Everyone desires a young girl.

287
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,833
The best girls are
entering this line.

288
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:32,041
Even homemakers...
This is the best time in Mumbai!

289
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:37,291
Even I need to make
money, isn't it?

290
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:41,083
Don't think that I can't
manage without you?

291
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:44,833
Do you understand?

292
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,083
Who are you trying to
impress with your language?

293
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,333
I am the one who has
been your mentor.

294
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:10,458
Your time is over.

295
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:16,666
You look old.
How long can I pull you on?

296
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:19,541
Who will give so much of money?

297
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:22,625
When I mention about
you, the customer says,

298
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:25,916
"Sallu, she is old stuff.

299
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:28,625
Bring some fresh splendor.

300
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:20,083
Eat this. It is good for you.

301
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:22,708
Take it... hold it.

302
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:29,708
Shall I get you something?

303
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:33,291
I'll get it right away.

304
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,375
How much sugar will you take, ma'am?

305
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:48,500
Don't make me uncomfortable
in my home by calling me ma'am.

306
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:50,416
Just say "you."

307
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:53,958
You... is too much.

308
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,541
-Don't you think so?
-No, it's okay.

309
00:35:57,708 --> 00:36:00,000
-So, how much sugar will you take?
-One teaspoon.

310
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:04,416
A little bit more.

311
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:13,000
I'll take it.

312
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,750
Wait.

313
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,166
Here you go.

314
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,458
One minute.

315
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:35,708
Take this. When you need to sit
on the potty-chair, strum the guitar.

316
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:48,125
He does not speak at all.

317
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,625
There is nothing that
he cannot express.

318
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,833
Particularly, when it's something
that he does not like. Right?

319
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:05,333
From how long has he been like this?

320
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:07,500
When he was born...

321
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:09,333
he was like this.

322
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,291
Oh, not again!

323
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:18,291
It's not for the potty-chair.
He wants you to open the window.

324
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,333
Are you coming with me?

325
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:08,958
What did you say?
Should I slap you?

326
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:11,166
Does your mother know
you rove around here?

327
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,625
But... I have money!

328
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,583
Really? Have you become that grown-up?
Get lost!

329
00:38:17,916 --> 00:38:18,750
Just fuck off!

330
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,750
-I really have the money!
-Damn you!

331
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:29,583
Showing off money!

332
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:51,375
Come on.

333
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:56,000
Eat this soup.

334
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:57,916
Hold it.

335
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:03,333
What's it?

336
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:06,416
Is there something in it?

337
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:10,166
Have it.
You don't want it?

338
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:13,833
Isn't it good? Shall I
get you something else?

339
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:17,083
Will you have bread and jam?

340
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,666
Should I get you some food?
A samosa or a fritter?

341
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,458
What is it?

342
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:28,333
Do you want to go out?

343
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,000
Yes! What is it?

344
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:38,041
What?
This cat?

345
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:40,708
You want this cat?

346
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:47,833
Here you go. Come.

347
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:06,791
Debu...
come and help me here.

348
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:14,208
Lift it.

349
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,541
Lift it! What are you doing?
Why are you acting like girls?

350
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:25,458
-Lift it.
-Leave it.

351
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:28,000
-Leave it.
-What is your problem?

352
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,958
Do you have a problem with a girl?

353
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:39,166
Haven't you ever done
anything with a girl?

354
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,541
There is no problem.

355
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:45,583
I see.
What's the problem?

356
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:47,958
You were crying for your
girlfriend at the bar.

357
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:50,750
It wasn't for my girlfriend.

358
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,708
Oh, my God! For your boyfriend?

359
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:56,875
I'm so stupid.

360
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:58,875
So that's the problem.

361
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:02,583
I see.

362
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:08,916
Neither could I agree with beauty
Nor was love of any use to me

363
00:41:12,416 --> 00:41:14,708
Are you mad at me?
I was joking.

364
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,833
I don't like such jokes.

365
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:20,916
Fine, I won't make fun of you.

366
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:23,166
I won't say a word at all.

367
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,416
But seriously...

368
00:41:26,208 --> 00:41:28,250
have you never done
anything with a girl?

369
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,041
Do you want to try it?

370
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:36,791
Go away!

371
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:24,500
Debu!
Kaku!

372
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:27,750
What is this?

373
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:29,750
-What happened?
-Are you going to watch TV all day?

374
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:31,333
No one is watching it!

375
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,666
With a foul mood you enter
Twirling and fretting

376
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:39,458
On a lonesome, monsoon night!

377
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:43,583
Why are the lights on?
What's wrong with you?

378
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:45,041
Why are you wasting all my money?

379
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:48,000
The TV is on and the fan is on.

380
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:51,208
And you keep writing all
night with the lights on.

381
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:52,750
Can't you write during the day?

382
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:54,500
I can't write in the day.

383
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:58,250
Please write during the day.

384
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:01,958
Her body and hair is wet

385
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,500
And she is crazy

386
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,125
She meets a stranger
In complete solitude

387
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:12,583
Isn't it weird and wonderful?

388
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:14,958
Wow! Brilliant!

389
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:19,375
This song is final...

390
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:22,083
but write something else.

391
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:27,500
Or else...

392
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:31,666
how will I present...
this dazzling beauty?

393
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:50,208
-This is just 5,000 rupees.
-Keep it with you.

394
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:53,125
You're writing the next
six songs as well.

395
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:56,041
Now you're one of us now.

396
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:31,083
Cloud to cloud,
Let's walk the sky

397
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:35,291
Let's smolder with love

398
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:42,791
Cloud to cloud,
Let's walk the sky

399
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,208
Let's smolder with love

400
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:52,666
Come, let us get drenched

401
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:55,791
Let's run away

402
00:44:56,666 --> 00:45:01,708
Come, let us get drenched

403
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,875
Let's run away

404
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:09,708
Cloud to cloud

405
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:13,208
Let's walk the sky

406
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:18,125
Come, let us get drenched

407
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:22,125
Let's run away

408
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:27,166
Come, let us get drenched

409
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:30,750
Let's run away

410
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:06,291
This world is temporal
Happiness is transient

411
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:12,041
Why grumble and grouse?

412
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:18,708
This world is temporal
Happiness is transient

413
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:22,166
Why grumble and grouse?

414
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,083
Sorrow is a treasured friend
It is dear to us

415
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:27,875
Why are you intimidated by sorrow?

416
00:46:27,958 --> 00:46:32,708
Cloud to cloud
Let's walk the sky

417
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:35,291
Let's smolder with love

418
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:40,541
Come, let us get drenched

419
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:44,166
Come, let's run away

420
00:46:52,416 --> 00:46:55,000
Debu...
get me some tea.

421
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,125
Kaku.

422
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:10,500
Kaku.

423
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:19,541
Kaku!
Bihari!

424
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:24,125
Bihari, I don't see
Kaku and Debu anywhere?

425
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,166
Don't worry!
I'm sure they are around.

426
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:31,833
He saw that I love writing.

427
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:33,500
He said, "Son...

428
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:39,125
do what your heart says."

429
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,500
If you want to do
something, you can do it.

430
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:07,000
Give me a clap!
Go take a nap!

431
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:07,166
Forget it.

432
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:10,875
You have never been close to Kaku.

433
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:16,458
He's a child...
he needs affection.

434
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:18,375
Debo is giving him a lot of affection.

435
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,291
You have not forgiven him...

436
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:25,333
because his father left you.

437
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:37,750
The cruel one gave me a look

438
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:43,541
At the crossing

439
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:52,291
That forced me to place my heart

440
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:56,750
At the tip of a knife

441
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:21,125
You've ruined my peace of mind
Keep your eyes off me, O cruel one!

442
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:28,208
You've ruined my peace of mind
Keep your eyes off me, O cruel one!

443
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:33,541
Distraught are the people of your city

444
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:38,375
Distraught are the people of your city

445
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:43,333
You've ruined my peace of mind
Keep your eyes off me, O cruel one!

446
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:48,250
Distraught are the people of your city

447
00:50:48,375 --> 00:50:53,916
Do show up
Before I cease my languid stretch

448
00:50:54,416 --> 00:50:58,583
Do show up
Before I cease my languid stretch

449
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:06,083
Adorned with kohl are your black eyes

450
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:11,041
Adorned with kohl are your black eyes

451
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:16,125
Adorned with kohl are your black eyes

452
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:20,958
Adorned with kohl are your black eyes

453
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:22,375
My eyes

454
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:24,291
Why is he wearing a lipstick?

455
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,000
What's the problem?
We're having fun.

456
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:30,333
I'm entertaining him.

457
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,875
Look... he is happy.

458
00:51:34,666 --> 00:51:36,583
Don't you care about his happiness?

459
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:39,250
Don't tell me what
my son means to me.

460
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,541
You are in this house
because of Kaku.

461
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:42,833
Do you want him to
become like you?

462
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:44,208
A dancing queen!

463
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:48,750
Remove it. Just get it off!
Don't you ever do this again!

464
00:51:51,666 --> 00:51:52,541
What kind of a mother are you?

465
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:54,416
You know nothing
about motherhood.

466
00:51:54,791 --> 00:51:56,166
You're a bloody eunuch!

467
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:03,041
What about you?
Who are you?

468
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,833
Well... what do they call you?

469
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:15,750
Whore! You are a whore.

470
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It pierces through and through

471
00:52:54,708 --> 00:52:58,625
The amorous arrow of your eyes

472
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:05,583
You've wounded my heart my love!

473
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:10,125
I'm crazy for your love

474
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:14,625
I'm crazy for your love

475
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,833
I'm crazy for your love

476
00:53:20,916 --> 00:53:24,083
I'm crazy for your love

477
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:40,583
-Ali.
-Debu.

478
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:47,125
-Do you live in this city?
-Yes.

479
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:05,083
What do you do?

480
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:19,583
I am a lyricist.

481
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:54,083
-Yes?
-It's me!

482
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,833
I might be late today!

483
00:54:57,166 --> 00:55:00,750
-Why? Have you found someone?
-Yes!

484
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:09,083
-Who will look after Kaku?
-You.

485
00:55:10,083 --> 00:55:11,375
You can look after him for a day.

486
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:20,125
You know I have to go out.

487
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,666
This new friend...

488
00:55:38,791 --> 00:55:40,125
-What is that?
-What?

489
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:41,125
See.

490
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,916
-Look at this.
-I see.

491
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,625
Show it to me.
What's this?

492
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:50,958
This...

493
00:55:58,166 --> 00:55:59,416
You haven't left yet?

494
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,208
I changed my mind.

495
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:08,541
Ali.
Juhi.

496
00:56:13,791 --> 00:56:14,750
Have a seat.

497
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:29,625
The magic of my eyes

498
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:42,333
The magic of my eyes

499
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:46,916
Has enchanted many of them

500
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:51,583
Has enchanted many of them

501
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:55,416
There are a lot of tales

502
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
There are a lot of tales

503
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,291
Related to my eyes

504
00:57:04,916 --> 00:57:08,708
Related to my eyes

505
00:57:08,916 --> 00:57:13,875
The magic of my eyes
Has enchanted many of them

506
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:36,875
You're not the only forlorn

507
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:45,666
You're not the only forlorn

508
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:50,625
Vexed in my love

509
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:54,875
Vexed in my love

510
00:57:55,458 --> 00:57:57,458
I'm yours...

511
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,666
Come on!
I am saying sorry.

512
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:27,083
I don't want to talk to you.

513
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:30,583
I was mad at you.
But I'm sorry. Please come out.

514
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:34,958
You did what you had to.

515
00:58:37,375 --> 00:58:38,291
Don't touch me.

516
00:58:40,291 --> 00:58:42,583
Forgive me, I'll not make fun of you.

517
00:58:42,666 --> 00:58:44,750
I won't laugh at you
and I won't touch you at all.

518
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:50,666
Play it!

519
00:58:58,375 --> 00:59:02,541
You can be angry

520
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:06,833
And I can appease you

521
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:11,458
This attitude causes me
To love you more

522
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:15,208
This attitude causes me
To love you more

523
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:19,125
Few grouses and some complaints

524
00:59:19,291 --> 00:59:23,500
Few grouses and some complaints

525
00:59:23,583 --> 00:59:27,583
Add thrill to life

526
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:31,583
Add thrill to life

527
00:59:31,666 --> 00:59:35,708
You can be angry

528
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:40,041
And I can appease you

529
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:44,666
This attitude causes me
To love you more

530
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:48,541
This attitude causes me
To love you more

531
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:52,708
Few grouses and some complaints

532
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:56,291
Few grouses and some complaints

533
00:59:56,375 --> 01:00:00,458
Add thrill to life

534
01:00:00,541 --> 01:00:05,125
Add thrill to life

535
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:21,375
If I get that kind of
simplicity in my lyrics...

536
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:26,791
"Why did You create puppets of clay...

537
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:30,500
A beautiful earth and bright faces?"

538
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:34,125
"Why did You create this world...

539
01:00:34,916 --> 01:00:37,166
With only a dash of youthfulness?"

540
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:41,916
"You silently watch the show...
Great is Your divinity!

541
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:47,583
Why did You create this world?"

542
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:53,000
-The writing was exemplary!
-Shailendra. No, it's by Hasrat Jaipuri.

543
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:03,208
"If you look into my eyes,
I will ask you about the fate of love"

544
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:07,833
"If you lower your eyes
I will pay you a silent salutation"

545
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:11,583
"In the shadow of your tresses
I will attain the peace of my life"

546
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:15,166
"I will traverse a journey of a lifetime
In that special moment"

547
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:18,208
Kaifi Azmi!

548
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,791
Nobody else can write
such a romantic song.

549
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,875
"It is just a feeling...
Experience it with your soul

550
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:33,083
Let it be...
Don't give it a name!"

551
01:01:34,166 --> 01:01:37,166
"I've seen the enchanting spark
Of these eyes

552
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:41,333
Don't let the world kill its magic
By defining it"

553
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:43,208
-Gulzar.
-Gulzar.

554
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:46,833
You remember all
these old songs?

555
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:49,375
How can I forget them?

556
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:52,208
I've grown up listening
to these songs.

557
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:05,500
There is a story about
Shailendra, the lyricist.

558
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:10,000
Shankar and Jaikishan had promised
to introduce him to a producer.

559
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:12,958
Somehow, they forgot about it.

560
01:02:13,916 --> 01:02:15,458
But, Shailendra kept waiting.

561
01:02:16,416 --> 01:02:18,541
Finally, Shailendra sent them
two lines written on a paper.

562
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:20,875
And...

563
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:24,750
Shankar Jaikishan created
this famous song...

564
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:30,458
It's a small world
All roads are familiar

565
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:35,750
We are bound to meet sometime
We are bound to meet somewhere

566
01:02:35,875 --> 01:02:39,208
I'll ask you then
How have you been?

567
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:55,583
The moon is in a state of slumber
In the unbounded sky

568
01:02:58,916 --> 01:03:03,833
I will spend a wakeful night

569
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:04,833
Good!

570
01:03:04,916 --> 01:03:10,625
How will you be able to sleep?

571
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:14,291
Who was your favorite hero?

572
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,375
My favorite...

573
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,333
Balraj Sahni.

574
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:26,833
-Really?
-What are you doing here?

575
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:29,791
Shut up! If we could do something,
why would we come out here?

576
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:31,125
Wouldn't we be at home?

577
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:33,291
-Come on...
-Leave me, he is a bloody swine!

578
01:03:41,666 --> 01:03:45,958
I have another favorite...
Guru Dutt.

579
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:49,000
Do you know how many
times I watched 'Pyaasa?'

580
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:51,083
17 times.

581
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:53,500
Do you remember Kumkum? She was
Waheeda Rehman's friend in the film?

582
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:55,208
Her name was also Juhi!

583
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:05,708
When did you...

584
01:04:07,791 --> 01:04:09,875
start this work?

585
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:13,416
Are you going to give me a lecture?

586
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:17,041
No, I'm just talking about it.

587
01:04:18,291 --> 01:04:21,000
If you want me to sob and
tell you my story...

588
01:04:22,916 --> 01:04:26,291
This was an easy way and I
grabbed the chance. That's all.

589
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:28,750
It's been many years now.

590
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:34,166
-Can you do something else?
-What?

591
01:04:36,125 --> 01:04:37,041
Anything else!

592
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,750
I mean... do you like all this?

593
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:41,958
It doesn't matter.

594
01:04:44,416 --> 01:04:45,333
For how long will you
continue doing it?

595
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,333
Forever?

596
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,958
Forget it! I don't about all this.

597
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:51,958
This is the only work I have.
That's all.

598
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:57,750
Don't you respect your body?

599
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,208
Will you just keep
giving it to everyone?

600
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:06,625
Body is a body! Come on.

601
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:08,916
Why should I give it
so much of importance?

602
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:11,083
I just sell my body.

603
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:14,166
People even sell their souls.

604
01:05:18,166 --> 01:05:20,375
Look at the state of that body!

605
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:25,583
It turns to dust.

606
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:30,000
Six hours on fire and
six minutes in the oven. That's all.

607
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:16,500
Hurry up! Come back.

608
01:06:17,916 --> 01:06:19,166
I want our child...

609
01:06:19,833 --> 01:06:21,500
to participate in the race.

610
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:24,000
Really?

611
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:26,500
This is a game, my dear.
Not a joke.

612
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:29,625
Come back. Hurry up!

613
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:33,875
Let's run!

614
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,750
Come back.

615
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:38,875
Come on.

616
01:06:58,916 --> 01:07:00,708
Give me my money.

617
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,125
I want my money!

618
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:04,250
I want my money!

619
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:06,833
Where are the three of
you are running away?

620
01:07:06,916 --> 01:07:10,125
I won't leave you.
Bloody hell!

621
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:11,458
-I want my money!
-Get lost!

622
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:12,666
Hey! Wait!

623
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:18,000
Mother fuckers!
Bloody hell!

624
01:07:18,708 --> 01:07:20,666
You will rot in hell!
Bloody hell!

625
01:07:47,916 --> 01:07:50,541
Juhi, what's your favorite dessert?

626
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:57,083
What happened, Juhi?
Where are you?

627
01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:31,666
Juhi...

628
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:27,750
Cloud to cloud,
Let's walk the sky

629
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:32,583
Let's smolder with love

630
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:41,541
Cloud to cloud,
Let's walk the sky

631
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:46,166
Let's smolder with love

632
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:52,250
Come let's get drenched
Let's run away...

633
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:57,208
Come let's get drenched
Let's run away...

634
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:05,708
Come let's get drenched
Let's run away...

635
01:12:06,041 --> 01:12:11,416
Come let's get drenched
Let's run away...

636
01:12:13,666 --> 01:12:17,416
With an ecstatic heart

637
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:22,333
We will ride the winds

638
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:29,125
With an ecstatic heart

639
01:12:29,416 --> 01:12:31,333
We will ride the winds

640
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:36,250
For once let's live unrestrained

641
01:12:36,416 --> 01:12:40,458
Even if tears well up

642
01:12:40,666 --> 01:12:45,375
Let's swallow them away...

643
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:49,875
Cloud to cloud
Let's walk the sky

644
01:12:50,125 --> 01:12:54,166
Let's smolder with love

645
01:12:54,666 --> 01:13:00,291
Come let's get drenched
Let's run away...

646
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:05,833
Come let's get drenched
Let's run away...

647
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:49,250
What is it?

648
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:51,708
What happened?

649
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,500
The cat is gone.

650
01:13:54,583 --> 01:13:57,750
Never mind, child.
It will come back.

651
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,041
Come, let's watch TV.

652
01:14:18,416 --> 01:14:22,375
In the empty receptacles of my heart

653
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:26,166
I found some forgotten coins

654
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:28,625
In the empty receptacles of my heart

655
01:14:29,791 --> 01:14:32,250
These lyrics... are mine.

656
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:35,833
Do you remember this?
These are my lyrics!

657
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:39,916
What is this?
They turned it to a sleazy, disco track.

658
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:45,166
They didn't even ask me
or tell me about it.

659
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:48,458
They've ruined my song!

660
01:15:36,791 --> 01:15:38,833
Repeat after me.

661
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:47,500
Repeat.

662
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:11,833
Ma... Ma...

663
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:13,875
Kaku!

664
01:16:14,541 --> 01:16:15,791
Kaku, what did you say?

665
01:16:16,208 --> 01:16:18,916
Did you say "Ma?"
Tell me.

666
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:22,250
Debu!
My child said, "Ma!"

667
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:25,458
Come here, Debu.
Where is your mother, child?

668
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:28,833
Did you teach him to say that?
Kaku said "Ma."

669
01:16:29,083 --> 01:16:32,333
Where's your mother, child?
Tell me. Where's your mother?

670
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,666
Tell me, child!

671
01:16:58,875 --> 01:17:00,583
I was only trying
to teach him...

672
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:40,333
Kaku is right.

673
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,958
I was busy playing a father's role.

674
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:48,083
And I forgot to be a mother.

675
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:53,500
I was in school.

676
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:56,375
And I ran away from home and got married.

677
01:17:58,416 --> 01:18:00,083
My family was furious.

678
01:18:00,791 --> 01:18:01,833
They abandoned me forever.

679
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:09,666
I dragged my marriage for seven years.

680
01:18:10,708 --> 01:18:14,291
I thought that having a child
would improve the situation.

681
01:18:15,666 --> 01:18:16,833
But it didn't.

682
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:24,333
When Kaku was born... my husband
knew that the child was not normal.

683
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:28,291
He ran away...
from the hospital.

684
01:18:29,416 --> 01:18:30,750
He was never seen again.

685
01:18:34,541 --> 01:18:38,500
I didn't have the money...
for the hospital.

686
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:42,166
I cried on that bench
for three days.

687
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:47,250
A man was observing me from a distance.

688
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:50,500
He said, "You can earn some money...

689
01:18:51,791 --> 01:18:55,166
but you'll have to go to
the hotel for two hours."

690
01:18:59,916 --> 01:19:00,833
I went and got the money.

691
01:19:03,166 --> 01:19:04,333
So...

692
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:15,625
This is my story.
What is your story?

693
01:19:19,916 --> 01:19:23,041
My Dad was in the Army.

694
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:29,375
His friends would visit us.

695
01:19:29,541 --> 01:19:31,166
They would talk about war.

696
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:33,750
I don't know...

697
01:19:35,041 --> 01:19:39,250
when I was attracted
towards them.

698
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:43,500
When I think about it...

699
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:48,125
Dad never gave me the affection I wanted.

700
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:52,541
He never spent time with me.

701
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:14,541
What about relationships?

702
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:19,541
I am a traveler on the path of love
Don't speak anything to me

703
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:23,166
Whoever meets me with love
I belong to them.

704
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,333
I mean...

705
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:36,333
I felt that...

706
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:46,458
Nothing is permanent.

707
01:20:47,166 --> 01:20:48,708
Everything keeps changing.

708
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:50,875
But the illusion of permanence...

709
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:55,791
it makes you feel good.

710
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:01,541
Aren't you lonely without Sameer?

711
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,833
"Where you don't feel the difference
Between sorrow and joy

712
01:21:09,416 --> 01:21:12,250
I have made my heart
To come at that state

713
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:17,583
Puff out every anxiety
In smoke..."

714
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:27,333
I wish I could say, that
I have no regrets...

715
01:21:29,625 --> 01:21:33,833
But, if we have no
regrets about anything...

716
01:21:34,875 --> 01:21:36,458
about our mistakes...

717
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,666
and about our impulsive behavior..
then it looks like...

718
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:42,208
life has not touched us at all.

719
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:46,166
It is said that...
our spiritual journey...

720
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,083
is incomplete.

721
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:02,333
I have one regret.

722
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:07,041
I can never be twenty again!

723
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:14,500
-Shut up!
-All right.

724
01:22:35,708 --> 01:22:36,666
I have wrinkles.

725
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:40,708
In the empty receptacles of my heart

726
01:22:41,166 --> 01:22:42,000
Look.

727
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:45,583
I found some forgotten coins

728
01:22:50,541 --> 01:22:54,666
In the empty receptacles of my heart

729
01:22:55,333 --> 01:22:58,750
I found some forgotten coins

730
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:03,500
What color should I use?

731
01:23:03,791 --> 01:23:04,666
Remove it.

732
01:23:07,958 --> 01:23:10,833
If you seek

733
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:13,375
You will find life again

734
01:23:13,458 --> 01:23:14,750
Don't wear it.

735
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:18,875
-Minimalism is in.
-Really!

736
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:23,291
You can seduce any man
by being subtle.

737
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:25,375
You?

738
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:27,875
-No. Not me!
-Why?

739
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:31,125
Because my heart doesn't
throb for a woman.

740
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:34,916
It has started to throb

741
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:36,458
Age has nothing to do with it.

742
01:23:36,541 --> 01:23:38,916
A woman can look
beautiful at any age.

743
01:23:42,875 --> 01:23:46,583
Welcome, my compassionate one

744
01:24:16,708 --> 01:24:17,750
What is it?

745
01:24:17,958 --> 01:24:20,375
Be soft and gentle.

746
01:24:21,333 --> 01:24:23,458
Juhi, adjust your sari.

747
01:24:43,833 --> 01:24:45,250
-Enough.
-Enough.

748
01:24:55,041 --> 01:24:56,458
There's no network here.
Wait.

749
01:25:49,583 --> 01:25:50,791
Do you have a room in the hotel?

750
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:53,041
Yes.

751
01:25:53,125 --> 01:25:53,958
Don't call me, ma'am.

752
01:25:54,041 --> 01:25:56,875
Let's talk business.
Do you want a good time?

753
01:25:58,083 --> 01:26:00,333
Just a minute.
I'll call you later.

754
01:26:01,083 --> 01:26:02,208
Ma'am. I...

755
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:04,958
Why are you feeling shy, lad?

756
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:09,333
-What are you doing?
-What? Nothing.

757
01:26:09,708 --> 01:26:10,625
-Let's go!
-What?

758
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:12,500
Let's go.
Right now.

759
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,791
I'm trying to raise
your standard, and you...

760
01:26:21,416 --> 01:26:23,208
This is a five-star hotel.
It's not your perch!

761
01:26:24,041 --> 01:26:26,125
Work is work.
Don't I have to run the household?

762
01:26:27,708 --> 01:26:29,708
Who will pay the bills?
Who will pay the rent?

763
01:26:30,166 --> 01:26:32,791
-You? Will you sell songs?
-Yes! I will sell songs.

764
01:26:34,291 --> 01:26:35,541
I write good songs.

765
01:26:36,583 --> 01:26:38,291
And the world will accept them.

766
01:26:40,791 --> 01:26:43,458
The producer liked my songs.

767
01:26:44,916 --> 01:26:47,833
You live in a bubble.
Your songs are stupid.

768
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:49,000
Write something about reality.

769
01:26:49,666 --> 01:26:51,125
Something unique.
Do you understand?

770
01:26:51,208 --> 01:26:53,750
Let's make love, darling

771
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:56,791
Listen to this!
This song is a hit!

772
01:26:56,875 --> 01:27:00,083
The day you grab the attention
of a common man...

773
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:03,000
your songs will sell and
become famous.

774
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:06,416
I will continue to write in my style.

775
01:27:08,166 --> 01:27:10,833
And my songs will become famous.

776
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:16,375
Fine!
Your time starts now.

777
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:18,666
Fine.

778
01:27:22,541 --> 01:27:23,791
-Sorry, my child!
-Hold on.

779
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:25,166
Come.

780
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:27,333
Let's go.

781
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:31,708
This is Debu.

782
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:33,166
Yes, Debu.
Tell me.

783
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:36,750
I was passing by your office.
I thought if I could just meet you.

784
01:27:37,125 --> 01:27:38,833
Don't be formal.
You can meet me anytime.

785
01:27:39,666 --> 01:27:42,958
Okay, sir.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

786
01:27:43,083 --> 01:27:46,000
Oh, no! I am in a meeting now.
Give me a call on Monday.

787
01:28:35,458 --> 01:28:38,083
With an ecstatic heart

788
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:41,125
We will ride the winds

789
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:44,083
For once
Let's live unrestrained

790
01:28:47,375 --> 01:28:48,916
With an ecstatic heart

791
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:51,958
We will ride the winds

792
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:56,375
For once
Let's live unrestrained

793
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:59,041
Even if tears well up

794
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:02,666
Let's swallow them away...

795
01:29:08,458 --> 01:29:12,833
Cloud to cloud
Let's walk the sky

796
01:29:13,041 --> 01:29:16,000
Let's smolder with love

797
01:29:16,083 --> 01:29:20,958
Come, let's get drenched

798
01:29:21,166 --> 01:29:24,291
Let's run away...

799
01:29:25,041 --> 01:29:32,833
Come, let's get drenched
Let's run away...

800
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:19,375
He has come back, Juhi!

801
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:24,958
-Who?
-Sameer! He called me.

802
01:30:29,041 --> 01:30:30,041
Sameer?

803
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:58,500
Like soft cotton
Sweet talk

804
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:04,583
Can fill the space
In just a moment

805
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:13,000
If you permit me
For a few moments

806
01:31:13,083 --> 01:31:17,458
It will be like light
It will be like life

807
01:31:17,583 --> 01:31:21,625
In the empty
receptacles of my heart

808
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:26,291
I found some forgotten coins

809
01:31:26,375 --> 01:31:28,375
Just by chance

810
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:34,458
You will find happiness

811
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:37,916
If you seek

812
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:43,166
You will find life again!

813
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:46,916
If you seek

814
01:31:47,333 --> 01:31:51,125
You will find life again!

815
01:31:53,083 --> 01:31:54,458
Will you go back to him?

816
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:04,041
But he threw you out of the
house and left you alone.

817
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:09,291
When someone realizes
his mistake...

818
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:15,750
Why are you sad?

819
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:19,458
He is going to meet his friend.
He'll come back.

820
01:32:23,333 --> 01:32:26,833
He can't live with us...
forever.

821
01:32:29,583 --> 01:32:30,833
He has his own life.

822
01:32:38,791 --> 01:32:41,125
-Are you making me look good?
-Dazzling!

823
01:32:41,708 --> 01:32:42,916
Come on. Get ready now.

824
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:44,750
I'm ready.

825
01:32:45,125 --> 01:32:47,125
-Are you wearing this?
-What else?

826
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:48,541
Wear something nice!

827
01:32:49,166 --> 01:32:51,625
I have just three shirts.
Two of them are dirty.

828
01:32:51,875 --> 01:32:53,416
It is rainy season.
And I need to wash them soon.

829
01:32:53,791 --> 01:32:54,708
I will bring you one.

830
01:33:00,916 --> 01:33:01,875
Wear this!

831
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:08,833
Come on, smile.

832
01:33:30,833 --> 01:33:31,750
Debu. Debu... hang on.

833
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:34,250
Give me a minute.
Have a seat.

834
01:33:43,708 --> 01:33:45,291
I am getting married.

835
01:33:48,125 --> 01:33:49,625
The girl is from Chandigarh.

836
01:33:51,041 --> 01:33:52,041
I'm engaged.

837
01:33:52,458 --> 01:33:53,500
My wedding is in the coming month.

838
01:33:59,625 --> 01:34:01,041
Is that why you have
called me here?

839
01:34:07,958 --> 01:34:09,958
I don't want anyone
to know about...

840
01:34:12,041 --> 01:34:13,166
our relationship.

841
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:27,208
I want a regular life.

842
01:34:30,208 --> 01:34:31,041
Children.

843
01:34:44,958 --> 01:34:46,000
Perhaps, I was alone in the city.

844
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,458
This will never come
out in the open.

845
01:35:52,416 --> 01:35:53,250
Debu!

846
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:56,541
What happened?

847
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,083
"Why should I fake a complaint?

848
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:03,500
So, what if my heart is shattered?

849
01:36:05,583 --> 01:36:07,000
It was like a toy, made of glass.

850
01:36:08,916 --> 01:36:10,458
It's broken.

851
01:36:11,666 --> 01:36:12,625
It's lost."

852
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,375
He did not come back for me.

853
01:36:26,375 --> 01:36:27,250
He is getting married...

854
01:36:29,333 --> 01:36:30,166
to a girl.

855
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,083
I am not going anywhere.

856
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:57,250
I will be here... with you.

857
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:25,583
What is this, Debu?

858
01:37:26,291 --> 01:37:27,916
You're looking at his pictures again.

859
01:37:28,083 --> 01:37:29,291
Throw them away!

860
01:37:30,416 --> 01:37:31,791
Forget him.
What's this?

861
01:37:42,625 --> 01:37:43,500
Listen to me, Debu.

862
01:37:43,916 --> 01:37:45,875
If Sameer lived with you
for three years...

863
01:37:46,958 --> 01:37:49,833
and can start a
new life with another girl now.

864
01:37:50,666 --> 01:37:51,708
What can't you do that?

865
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,166
Because he is Sameer.

866
01:37:54,166 --> 01:37:55,125
And this is me.

867
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,916
What's the harm in trying?

868
01:38:03,375 --> 01:38:04,416
No. Do it for real.

869
01:38:13,333 --> 01:38:14,583
Leave this idea.

870
01:38:15,083 --> 01:38:16,166
Nothing will happen.

871
01:38:16,833 --> 01:38:20,208
When you've never
tried it with a woman,

872
01:38:21,083 --> 01:38:22,833
how do you know that
nothing will happen?

873
01:38:24,625 --> 01:38:28,583
Look... when we met,
we had our needs.

874
01:38:29,583 --> 01:38:31,958
You needed a shelter
and I wanted a maid.

875
01:38:33,125 --> 01:38:37,416
But now, everything has changed.
We have bonded.

876
01:38:38,833 --> 01:38:40,458
Kaku loves you so much.

877
01:38:41,375 --> 01:38:42,791
You love him too.

878
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:46,916
Now the question is...

879
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:49,583
about the two of us.

880
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:53,458
You and me...

881
01:38:54,083 --> 01:38:56,166
Me and you...

882
01:39:07,458 --> 01:39:10,583
Yes!
Kaku, you and me.

883
01:39:18,416 --> 01:39:22,208
After showering them
With a pleasing fragrance

884
01:39:22,291 --> 01:39:25,125
When I first taste

885
01:39:25,833 --> 01:39:29,583
The prickly heat of the sun
The hailstones of rain

886
01:39:29,666 --> 01:39:32,833
I keep to myself

887
01:39:33,166 --> 01:39:36,875
After showering them
With a pleasing fragrance

888
01:39:37,041 --> 01:39:39,875
When I first taste it

889
01:39:40,666 --> 01:39:43,500
I carefully sieve

890
01:39:44,416 --> 01:39:47,500
And sell the cool silk of the shade

891
01:39:48,041 --> 01:39:51,625
After carefully sieving

892
01:39:51,875 --> 01:39:54,916
I sell the cool silk of the shade

893
01:39:55,041 --> 01:39:56,750
I sell seasons

894
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:02,083
All year round

895
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,500
I sell seasons

896
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:09,375
All year round

897
01:40:09,833 --> 01:40:11,541
I sell seasons

898
01:40:11,833 --> 01:40:14,791
All year round

899
01:40:15,375 --> 01:40:17,375
All year round

900
01:40:39,583 --> 01:40:44,166
Welcome! O my loved one

901
01:40:45,583 --> 01:40:48,916
Be seated, O my beloved

902
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:53,166
Be pleased

903
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:56,000
To test my passion

904
01:40:57,708 --> 01:41:02,583
Be pleased
To test my passion

905
01:41:03,375 --> 01:41:06,875
This darkness is cast

906
01:41:07,958 --> 01:41:11,625
By the silken tresses

907
01:41:12,625 --> 01:41:15,333
Don't be troubled

908
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:19,583
Till you are allured

909
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:23,000
By the fragrance of my tresses

910
01:41:23,291 --> 01:41:25,541
Come thus far!

911
01:41:26,666 --> 01:41:32,166
This darkness is cast
By the silken tresses

912
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:34,208
Don't be troubled

913
01:41:34,666 --> 01:41:37,125
Till you are allured

914
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:41,291
By fragrance of my tresses

915
01:41:42,041 --> 01:41:46,708
Whosoever met your splendor
Became thine

916
01:41:46,791 --> 01:41:51,458
I have surrendered myself to someone...
Someone has become mine

917
01:41:51,541 --> 01:41:56,083
What did I see in you
That I lost my heart

918
01:41:56,166 --> 01:42:01,000
Lost in such thoughts
Night glided towards dawn

919
01:42:01,583 --> 01:42:07,750
Go wherever you may

920
01:42:07,958 --> 01:42:14,666
You can't but help look back

921
01:42:14,875 --> 01:42:20,666
You can't but help look back

922
01:42:21,083 --> 01:42:28,291
Wonder what you uttered
Wonder what I heard

923
01:42:28,916 --> 01:42:32,833
A confab has been created

924
01:42:32,916 --> 01:42:36,208
Wonder what you uttered

925
01:42:36,333 --> 01:42:40,166
Wonder what I heard

926
01:42:40,291 --> 01:42:44,000
A confab has been created

927
01:42:44,083 --> 01:42:46,958
Wonder what you uttered
Wonder what I heard

928
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:36,625
Debu...

929
01:45:47,458 --> 01:45:48,291
What happened?

930
01:45:50,083 --> 01:45:51,666
Tell me. What happened?

931
01:45:53,333 --> 01:45:55,791
Tell me, Kaku.
What happened?

932
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,375
When it is not possible to
bring a tale to an end,

933
01:46:04,208 --> 01:46:07,416
giving it up at an amiable
juncture is appropriate.

934
01:46:14,291 --> 01:46:17,291
Some things are
never meant to be.

935
01:46:27,125 --> 01:46:31,541
But... living under the same
roof with you is difficult.

936
01:46:34,083 --> 01:46:35,625
You will have to live your life...

937
01:46:37,041 --> 01:46:38,958
And, I will have to find mine.

938
01:46:39,625 --> 01:46:44,041
I will miss Kaku and you.

939
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:03,708
This world is temporal

940
01:47:04,958 --> 01:47:08,625
Happiness is transient

941
01:47:09,666 --> 01:47:14,250
Why grumble and grouse?

942
01:47:16,541 --> 01:47:20,958
This world is temporal
Happiness is transient

943
01:47:21,166 --> 01:47:25,541
Why grumble and grouse?

944
01:47:25,666 --> 01:47:31,250
Sorrow is a dear friend

945
01:47:31,375 --> 01:47:35,833
Why should we get intimidated by sorrow?

946
01:47:35,958 --> 01:47:40,208
Cloud to cloud
Let's walk the sky

947
01:47:40,458 --> 01:47:44,500
Let's smolder with love

948
01:47:45,666 --> 01:47:49,291
Nothing happened, the
way I had imagined it to be.

949
01:47:52,208 --> 01:47:53,416
Get back to work.

950
01:47:55,833 --> 01:47:57,541
This is the only thing to do.

951
01:47:59,291 --> 01:48:01,541
This won't last forever.

952
01:48:02,875 --> 01:48:06,416
Use it, as long... as it works.

953
01:48:07,458 --> 01:48:08,666
I have a new number.

954
01:48:10,666 --> 01:48:12,125
I'll give you a missed call.

955
01:48:15,125 --> 01:48:16,166
Let me know.

956
01:48:30,916 --> 01:48:35,333
Cloud to cloud,
Let's walk the sky

957
01:48:35,541 --> 01:48:38,541
Let's smolder with love

958
01:48:40,208 --> 01:48:43,583
Come let's get drenched

959
01:48:44,291 --> 01:48:48,041
Come let's get drenched

960
01:48:48,458 --> 01:48:51,250
Let's run away

961
01:48:51,541 --> 01:48:55,125
Come let's get drenched

962
01:48:55,625 --> 01:48:59,833
Come let's get drenched

963
01:48:59,958 --> 01:49:03,791
Let's run away

964
01:49:25,541 --> 01:49:26,500
Tell me, Sallu!

965
01:49:27,875 --> 01:49:29,208
Where do I have to reach?

966
01:50:44,666 --> 01:50:47,875
Nothing is permanent.
Everything keeps changing.

967
01:50:48,333 --> 01:50:54,583
Yes, but the illusion of permanence...
it makes you feel good.

968
01:51:11,458 --> 01:51:14,000
Juhi, you can do something else.

969
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:24,291
Juhi! Where are you?

970
01:51:24,791 --> 01:51:25,625
-Where have you reached?
-I'm here.

971
01:51:26,041 --> 01:51:28,750
I am about to reach.
There is lot of traffic here.

972
01:51:29,125 --> 01:51:33,500
The customer has called me twice.
Please try to reach as soon as possible.

973
01:51:40,166 --> 01:51:44,208
Don't you respect your body?

974
01:51:45,375 --> 01:51:49,166
Will you just keep
giving it to anybody?

975
01:51:50,125 --> 01:51:53,875
Body is a body! Why should I
give it so much of importance?

976
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,291
For how long will you continue doing it?
Forever?

977
01:52:01,041 --> 01:52:03,541
Forget it!
I don't think that far!

978
01:52:03,708 --> 01:52:05,250
This is the only work I know!
That's all!

979
01:52:17,208 --> 01:52:19,750
Juhi! How long does it
take reach the hotel?

980
01:52:20,541 --> 01:52:24,000
I am in front of the hotel.
I'm going inside.

981
01:52:27,708 --> 01:52:29,791
What is this? I'm trying to
raise your standard and look at you.

982
01:52:31,083 --> 01:52:33,125
Work is work. Don't
I have to run the household?

983
01:52:33,708 --> 01:52:36,875
Who will pay the bills? Who
will pay the rent? You?

984
01:52:40,958 --> 01:52:44,625
Get back to work.
This is the only thing to do.

985
01:52:45,333 --> 01:52:50,375
This won't last forever.
Use it, as long as it works.

986
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:13,958
-You can do something else!
-What?

987
01:53:14,250 --> 01:53:16,375
Anything else!

988
01:53:45,875 --> 01:53:46,791
Juhi, are you there yet?

989
01:53:46,958 --> 01:53:47,916
Sallu, I won't go!

990
01:53:48,875 --> 01:53:49,708
What do you mean?

991
01:53:52,375 --> 01:53:53,625
I will not do this work anymore!

992
01:53:54,416 --> 01:53:55,875
What will you do?

993
01:53:57,666 --> 01:54:00,750
Anything... anything else.

994
01:55:53,666 --> 01:55:55,125
How are you?

995
01:55:58,375 --> 01:55:59,666
You know, Juhi...

996
01:56:16,083 --> 01:56:17,125
It's raining!

997
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:21,875
Keep it away!
Let me get drenched!

998
01:56:22,208 --> 01:56:23,916
-No!
-What are you doing?

999
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:34,416
I'm sure you will want to listen

1000
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:36,583
to the next song over and over again,

1001
01:56:36,666 --> 01:56:39,166
and set it as your mobile ringtone.

1002
01:56:39,250 --> 01:56:41,083
I am already in love with this song.

1003
01:56:41,250 --> 01:56:44,458
The song has been composed
by Sandesh Shandilya.

1004
01:56:44,541 --> 01:56:47,375
And it's written by Devendra Prasad.

1005
01:56:47,458 --> 01:56:50,708
However, the writer wants
to be known as Debu.

1006
01:56:50,791 --> 01:56:51,708
So, Debu...

1007
01:56:53,833 --> 01:56:55,666
If you are listening to us...

1008
01:56:57,125 --> 01:56:58,875
You're listening to 95.10 FM.

1009
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:03,666
