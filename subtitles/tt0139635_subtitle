3
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,820
Good for nothing! Donkey!

4
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,976
- Doctor! Doctor...
- Yes?

5
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,600
- Yes, Rai Bahadur saheb?
- I just heard that...

6
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,100
Dilip has gone out
with that very same girl.

7
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,550
That worthless creature
does not care for me...

8
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,320
- nor for his family's honor.
- But, Rai Bahadur saheb...

9
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,930
But? How do I
make him understand?

10
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,036
If I try, he says he's broken
up with that girl...

11
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,640
and has found a girl from
a good family to marry.

12
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,560
What a strange conundrum!
But, Rai Bahadur saheb...

13
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,910
we must definitely find a solution.

14
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,170
- A solution? - Yes.
- Of course!

15
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,360
There's a solution.

16
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,056
However, I'll need your help
to execute the plan.

17
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,690
Eh? My help?
Tell me.

18
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,260
- I'll pretend to fall ill, and...
- Yes, yes...

19
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,210
you tell Dilip...

20
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,550
to bring that girl from
a good family to meet me.

21
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,100
Once he gets entangled...

22
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,350
He won't find it easy
to untangle himself!

23
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,440
Hello? Hello?
Is that Dr.. Patel?

24
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,430
Sir, this is Matadeen speaking.
Please come here imediately.

25
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,000
The master is very ill.
Yes, sir.

26
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,210
Hello? Who's this?

27
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,760
"Dainik Samachar"? ["Daily News"]
Rai Bahadur saheb's condition is critical.

28
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,310
Shhh! Dilip is coming!

29
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:02,590
- Doctor, may I give him fruit juice now?
- Of course you may.

30
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,766
Thrombosis of the heart.
Very dangerous.

31
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,950
That means his condition
is critical.

32
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,550
In my opinion, he may survive
for a few hours at most.

33
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,170
Dadaji, please drink this.

34
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:37,176
No, no... I will not drink anything
that a fraud like you gives me.

35
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,860
- Dadaji!
- Get out of my sight!

36
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,586
I don't want to even
talk to you.

37
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,410
Please listen to me, dadaji.
I have not deceived you.

38
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,620
I swear I have broken all ties
with Nayantara...

39
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,030
and am in love with a girl
from a respectable family.

40
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,300
Where is that girl, then?
Why don't you bring her to me?

41
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,956
There is such a girl,
but I fear...

42
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,890
- you may reject her too, since she comes from a poor family.
- Liar!

43
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,790
Lying to me on my
death bed! Get out!

44
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,360
- Get out! - Dadaji!
- Get out, get out! - Doctor!

45
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,480
Dadaji...

46
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,836
His pulse is very weak.
Dr.. Shukla, please wait here.

47
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,490
- I'll arrange for oxygen.
- Doctor saab...

48
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,320
Doctor saheb, please save
my dadaji's life.

49
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,586
Please keep him alive for a few hours
so I can fulfil his last wish, doctor.

50
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,556
- I can't promise, Dilip. He's very critical.
- I understand.

51
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,640
I can't say when his heart
will stop responding.

52
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,796
Eh? What did you say?

53
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,300
His heart can stop responding
any moment?

54
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,670
Hey, Gopal! Where
are you, Gopal?

55
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,506
- You will ruin everything!
- Sir, me?

56
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,726
Arre, call the manager,
call the editor...

57
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,480
call the compositor,
call everyone, quick!

58
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,170
- Is everything ready?
- Sir, there's some work pending.

59
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,630
There's still some work left?
You've ruined everything!

60
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,996
Make it fast, make it fast!
Is your article ready?

61
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,520
- It's almost ready.
- Almost?

62
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,866
You will ruin me. For God's sake,
please write quickly!

63
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,770
Start printing whatever is ready.

64
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,640
Our newspaper should be
published at the earliest.

65
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,376
If we lose this opportunity,
we'll be ruined.

66
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,390
Shouldn't we await
the news of his death?

67
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,640
What did you say, manager?

68
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,620
News of his death? It seems you
haven't looked at this article of mine.

69
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,600
Dear sir, for the sake of this article,
the Rai Bahadur must die.

70
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,900
Yes, indeed. Please pay
attention to the listings.

71
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,370
Listen...

72
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,580
"The sudden demise of...

73
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,416
Rai Bahadur Durlabh Chand,
one of the city's prominent citizens...

74
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,410
and his grandson, Dilip's love
for famous dancer...

75
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,470
and hopeful filmstar, Nayantara"

76
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,766
I will not speak, not reveal...

77
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,046
the secrets of my heart

78
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,480
I will not lift my veil

79
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,120
What do these teasing eyes...

80
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,660
sparkling with mischief say?

81
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,646
Trembling behind the veil sits...

82
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,840
a shy, bashful mynah

83
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,940
Those feelings hidden
deep within my heart

84
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,180
I sway to their beat.
I sway...

85
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,260
I will not speak, nor reveal

86
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,460
Give me no covert
glances, my beloved...

87
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,670
lest I shiver in ecstasy

88
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,640
I'll die of embarassment

89
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,980
Of such tender years am I,
such tender years

90
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,246
I will not speak, nor reveal...

91
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,586
the secrets of my heart

92
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,490
I will not lift my veil,
will not speak

93
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,796
Excellent! Excellent, baby!

94
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,370
- Excellent!
- In fact, absolutely first class!

95
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,030
Indeed, I would say,
Director saaheb...

96
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,660
nobody, anywhere in
the world, can match...

97
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,170
Nayantara's artistry in dance.

98
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,366
Oh, come on! You've mastered
the art of flattery.

99
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,066
What do you mean, Baby?
That we are all lying?

100
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,466
Just get Dilip to finance the film,
and watch what I can do!

101
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,056
In my opinion, where's the delay now
in shooting the film? Tell me?

102
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,806
Rai Bahadur? Consider the
Rai Bahadur's journey done.

103
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,940
Bless you! Bless you,
my Khamakha, just...

104
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,470
bless you! Baby... Baby...

105
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,756
As soon as the Rai Bahadur's
funeral procession sets off...

106
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,100
'Nayantara Great Art Productions'
will also begin...

107
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,870
- its journey. Tell me how, Mr. Khamakha?
- Like this!

108
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,720
- Baby! Narang!
- Forgive me, Mummy!

109
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,776
- What happened, Mummy?
- Dilip had just telephoned...

110
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,610
to say the Rai Bahadur
is very ill.

111
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,860
Baby, I didn't like Dilip's manner
of speaking over the phone.

112
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,176
- What was he saying?
- I'm not sure, but he sounded distracted.

113
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,216
Don't worry, Mummy! [lncomprehensible]

114
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,260
If he falls for his
dadaji's advice...

115
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,006
- then all our plans will bite the dust.
- No, Mummy, please don't say that!

116
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,556
- Then I won't become a director.
- Baby, you should be careful.

117
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,370
- Is Dilip coming here, Mummy?
- Yes.

118
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,290
Eh? Then I must think of
a twist in the story.

119
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,670
Twist... twist...

120
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,460
Got it! Got it!
Baby, I got it!

121
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,440
Listen! The moment Dilip enters,
your face should reflect your sadness.

122
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,246
Your heart must beat faster,
sighs should part your lips...

123
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,400
and your eyes fill
with tears. Tears...

124
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,056
Mr. Music Director, as soon as
you see her tears...

125
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,316
you must begin playing
a sad melody...

126
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,056
that encompasses hurt, anticipation...

127
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,740
separation, fire and ice,
all melded together.

128
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,226
He's here! He's here...
please, be ready.

129
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,140
Please, please... get ready..
Please go now.

130
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,090
Welcome, welcome, Dilip babu.
Please come in, be seated.

131
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,586
Please come in, Mr. Dilip.
Please be seated.

132
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:14,110
Nayantara, there's bad news.

133
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,560
Mr. Music Director, forget about
your pipe! Let it be!

134
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,106
Think about the music!
Suspenseful music...

135
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,240
Suspense!
Loudly! Start!

136
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,080
How do I tell you, Nayan, that I've come
only to be separated from you forever?

137
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,670
Dadaji does not approve
of our relationship.

138
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,000
He doesn't want you
to be my bride...

139
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,450
and in a fit of pique, is ready
to even kill himself.

140
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,336
Darling! What are you saying?

141
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,790
I rejected five contracts
for your sake.

142
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,260
Just for you, I... Mummy!

143
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,970
Baby! Oh, Baby!

144
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:57,530
Sad music... sad music!
Start... Start!

145
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,040
Don't cry. Brute!

146
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,400
I am constrained, Nayan,
helpless...

147
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,820
I can't hurt him while he's dying;
I have to make him happy.

148
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,200
Somehow, I'll have to present him
with a girl he approves...

149
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,790
and accepting her as my wife,
accept his final blessings.

150
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,950
Baby... darling...

151
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,200
Oh, Dilip babu, Dilip babu,
how can this be? Just think...

152
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,660
when you appear on screen as hero,
along with Nayantara...

153
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,946
by God, it will be such a
fantastic film that...

154
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,456
it will certainly celebrate
a diamond jubilee!

155
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,300
How can I present such a
heartless image to the world?

156
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,430
- He has, perhaps, but a few hours to live.
- What did you say?

157
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,070
- A few hours? A few hours...
- That's what the doctors said.

158
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,430
Wait a sec, wait a sec...
Let me think.

159
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll think of a twist, such a twist,
Dilip babu, that everyone will be saved.

160
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,620
Twist... twist... I have it!

161
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,500
- Mr Dilip, got it!
- What did you get?

162
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,296
Twist. An incredible twist that
can easily solve the problem.

163
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,786
- Understood?
- Only that the Rai Bahadur can die...

164
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,080
- and yet, their relationship need not end.
- Exactly!

165
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,800
Look, Mr. Dilip, as soon
as possible...

166
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,296
find a girl somewhere whom you can
present to your dadaji.

167
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,230
- Got it?
- What? Another girl?

168
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,830
That's right! You're
absolutely right.

169
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,080
Dilip babu, that means your
dadaji will die happily...

170
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,960
and here, you...

171
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,420
and Nayantara can continue
to live happily.

172
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,956
No, no, no! This is deceit,
a real deception.

173
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,240
I can't deceive my dadaji
at a time like this!

174
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,290
Then, why don't you just say
that you don't love me?

175
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,800
Hey, what happened?
Baby, what's the matter?

176
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,626
Oh, she's fainting.
Baby, please collect yourself.

177
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,080
- Darling! Brute!
- Nayan, please get up, darling.

178
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,476
- Please get up...
- Dear sir!

179
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,106
You are concerned about a corpse
who will tarry for a few hours?

180
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,386
Please be kind enough to glance
at this living corpse.

181
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,420
If you reject her, what will happen
to this love-sick girl?

182
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,760
I agree. It's okay with me,
Director saheb.

183
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,660
I can't lose my Nayantara.
Nayan!

184
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,106
- Nayan! - Baby?
- Please wake up, Nayan.

185
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,670
- Darling? - Nayan... Nayan...
- Baby...

186
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,390
Where... am... I?

187
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,370
With me. Deep in my eyes.

188
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,486
- Dilip! - Nayan...
- Darling!

189
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,230
Baby, Dilip has consented.

190
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,770
Really? How sweet!

191
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,760
- You angel!
- Mummy!

192
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,146
Now, we have to find a girl.

193
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,320
And by girl, I mean
such a girl...

194
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,106
whom the old man will approve of,
as soon as he sets eyes on her.

195
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,006
And who will, after his death...

196
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,280
take a few hundred rupees
and go her own way.

197
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,930
You're absolutely right,
Mr. Khamakha.

198
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,646
Leave this to me; I'll get it
done in a snap!

199
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,270
- I'm sure. - Come, Mr. Dilip.
- Let's go. Bye, Nayan.

200
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,320
Dilip babu, Dilip babu, quick!
Quick! There are many here.

201
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,140
Wait, Wait Mr. Dilip Extra
Suppliers Association.

202
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,616
We will definitely find a girl here
who fits our requirements.

203
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,140
Master, Master, we need a girl.

204
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,936
She should be respectable,
educated... do you have anyone like that?

205
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,170
- Arre, we can get...
- Shut up!

206
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,340
Shut up? Shut up, Master?
Shut up! We don't want the girl.

207
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,900
No problem. We'll
find a girl somewhere.

208
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,566
- Get out!
- What happened?

209
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,380
- You get out first.
- A twist!

210
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,730
I've seen a lot of your twists.

211
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,290
Dadaji may have calmed down
by now. Get out!

212
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,100
Help! Help!

213
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,290
- Where have you brought me?
- This is my house.

214
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,210
Listen, whatever dadaji says,
just listen to him quietly.

215
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,130
- I beg of you!
- Arre, what are you doing? - Please!

216
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,070
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's.

217
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,650
- Dilip is coming.
- Lie down. - Yes.

218
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,990
Be quick.

219
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,320
Dilip... hasn't he arrived yet?

220
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,730
I'm here, dadaji!
Here's your dau...

221
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,090
Er... just the sort of person
you'd approve of.

222
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,210
Come, my child.
Come, beside me.

223
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,860
Go, go...

224
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,860
She's a bit shy, dadaji.
This is my dadaji.

225
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,350
- Doctor saab... - Sit, my child.
- Bless you, child.

226
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,080
Dr.ink it, sir.
Please drink it now.

227
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,100
- Don't refuse it now.
- Yes.

228
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,190
- Only from her... - Excuse me?
- Yes, yes, take it, my dear.

229
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,320
Give it to him. Here.
Excellent!

230
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,460
You came at the
right moment, my dear.

231
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,220
If you hadn't, it would have been
difficult to save his life.

232
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,710
- What's your name, my dear?
- Kiran.

233
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,620
Kiran?

234
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,690
You are truly a ray of light.

235
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,960
- I was looking for a girl like you.
- Excuse me?

236
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,680
- Understood, Doctor?
- Of course! - Just like her.

237
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,480
God heard my prayers after all.
What about your parents?

238
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,780
- They are no more.
- Poor dear.

239
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,370
- Their name?
- Munshi Premnath.

240
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,100
Premnath... Who?
Munshi Brijkishore's son?

241
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,550
Yes. Why, do you know him?

242
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,810
I know him very well, my dear.

243
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,810
He was my childhood friend.

244
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,760
Why, you donkey! Why didn't
you tell me this earlier?

245
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,420
- You hardly gave me an opportunity to...
- Ha! You know, my dear...

246
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,030
we studied together.

247
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,586
We liked each other...

248
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:01,176
- a lot. - I told you, didn't I?
- What?

249
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,460
- Rai Bahadur saheb, you're exerting yourself...
- Don't worry, Doctor.

250
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,910
I'm not going to die now.

251
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,466
My daughter-in-law
has come home.

252
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,160
Now I'll talk to her about
some personal matters.

253
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,630
Now, you may please leave,
all of you.

254
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,330
- Where are you going?
- Oh, out with the doctor... - No!

255
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,280
- Just wait here.
- Alright.

256
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,810
Tell me something, my dear...

257
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,816
When did you meet Dilip
for the first time?

258
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,426
- Today?
- Yes.

259
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:35,600
She's absolutely right! Fact is, dadaji,
we've known each other a long time.

260
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,520
Since we were in school together.

261
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,510
But whenever we meet, it seems
like we're meeting for the first time.

262
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,776
- Really? - Yes!
- So, my dear...

263
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,530
- you studied in a school here in Bombay?
- Yes.

264
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,460
But, as far as I know...

265
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,116
I enrolled you, not in Bombay...

266
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,970
- but in a school in Dehradun?
- Yes, of course.

267
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,990
Then, you were studying
in Dehradun...

268
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,916
and she studied in Bombay.
Then how did you meet?

269
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,046
Dadaji, I told you before,
and am saying so now, too...

270
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,296
that once, her school's
cricket team...

271
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,160
came to our school to play
a match against our team.

272
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,560
She was a part of team.
And we met while playing.

273
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,986
- You met while playing?
- Yes!

274
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,530
The way I smashed
a boundary... Wham!

275
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:27,106
But she caught the ball.
And I said, "Well played!"

276
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,170
She said "Thank you."

277
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,026
And our relationship took off
from there. Didn't it?

278
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,150
Fantastic! That's amazing.

279
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,360
So, nowadays, girls play
cricket too?

280
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,226
- Eh, why're you making faces?
- Dadaji...

281
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,240
you know the fish
I ate at breakfast?

282
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,800
The bone is stuck in my throat.

283
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,680
Who knows what else is stuck
in your throat today.

284
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,376
But you're very fortunate.

285
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,320
Dadaji, it's due to your kindness.

286
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,180
The benevolence is
not mine, but hers.

287
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,500
My dear, you're happy
with this alliance, aren't you?

288
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,316
Dadaji, if she weren't, why would
she come here with me?

289
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,226
- Dadaji, I...
- am getting late, right?

290
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,180
Come on, I'll drop you.
Why are you stressed?

291
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,316
Oh, dadaji, she's embarrassed
by the talk of marriage.

292
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,576
- Come, come, let's go.
- Go? Go where?

293
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,796
- The college, dadaji, where she has a function to attend.
- Dilip!

294
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,790
Listen, dadaji, I brought her here
only to dispel your doubts. Or else...

295
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,520
Why're you staring?
Let's go.

296
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,850
If I don't drop you on time,
you will begin crying.

297
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,980
Oh, come on, now! Come...
Dadaji...

298
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,720
I apologize for the trouble.

299
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,870
Everything's messed up,
I don't know what to do.

300
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,840
The car's outside.
It will drop you. Look...

301
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,560
I will always be
grateful to you.

302
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,380
I didn't realize you brought me here
for such a deceitful reason.

303
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,330
Aren't you ashamed of deceiving
your innocent dadaji?

304
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,610
Take your money.
It's perhaps dearer to you.

305
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,220
What can I say, Nayan, darling?
It's a bigger mess now.

306
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,600
Dadaji is perfectly alright now.

307
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,650
Yes, I'll try to meet you
this evening.

308
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:32,860
- This evening.
- Sir, the master's conditon has worsened again.

309
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,970
Again?

310
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,640
- What happened, dadaji?
- Bring her to me.

311
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,700
- Who?
- My bahurani. [Daughter-in-law.]

312
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,090
Bahurani? But dadaji...

313
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:57,080
- she will be at college now.
- I know nothing of any college.

314
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,350
- Go quickly and bring her here.
- Be patient, dadaji.

315
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,726
If your condition becomes critical
like it did yesterday...

316
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,590
- you will be in trouble.
- Not 'will be'.

317
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,680
I'm already in trouble!

318
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,850
- Oh, this heart ache...
- Take care, dadaji, don't stress.

319
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,396
Go quickly, and
bring her to me...

320
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:16,640
- I... - or I'll be dead.
- I'll be right back, dadaji. lmmediately!

321
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,590
- Arre, Dilip!
- Doctor saab...

322
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,130
Thank God you arrived
at the right moment!

323
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,520
- Dadaji's heart is giving him trouble again.
- Oh...

324
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,090
Please take care of him, Doctor saab.
I'll be right back. lmmediately!

325
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,490
Tell me truthfully what the matter is.
I hope the situation...

326
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,576
is not tangled up?

327
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
You're responsible
for all this trouble.

328
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,230
If I hadn't listened to you and
gone to the Rai Bahadur's house...

329
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,480
- I wouldn't be in this mess now.
- Oh!

330
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,420
So that's the problem...
You're in a mess?

331
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,290
Oh God! Please bless everyone
with a mess like Dilip.

332
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,880
Oh, go away! You think
everything's a joke!

333
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,980
Do you know the Rai Bahadur
turned out to be my dadaji's friend?

334
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,370
How considerate is it to
deceive him like this?

335
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:12,520
Oh, that explains it. Anyway,
let Dilip babu come.

336
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,006
This time, I'll tell him in
no uncertain terms...

337
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,486
listen, my Kiran doesn't approve
of such deceit.

338
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,096
- You should really make her your...
- Rubbish, Malti.

339
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,096
Wow! You say 'Rubbish'
out loud but...

340
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,406
inwardly, you're over the moon!
Sit here quietly and relax!

341
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,230
You aren't going to Poona
or anywhere else!

342
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,040
No, Malti, you don't understand.

343
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,310
If the Rai Bahadur comes to take
me home, I cannot refuse.

344
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,596
And what if his grandson
comes here?

345
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,740
I'll throw him out. I'll throw
that cheat out at once!

346
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,650
Oh... It's you!
Please come in.

347
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:53,256
- You have to come with me now.
- Go with you?

348
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,850
Yes, right now. lmmediately.
We can't delay a minute.

349
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,600
- We can't delay even a minute?
- That's right. Please hurry up.

350
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,730
- Be quick, won't you?
- Be quick...

351
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,080
- Am I your slave? - No...
- An indentured laborer?

352
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,206
- You don't understand...
- How dare you order me about? - Not at all.

353
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,636
- Be quick, be quick! - I just...
- Am I your maid servant?

354
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,076
- Your ayah? - Listen, you've got it all wrong. I...
- Yes, indeed I have!'

355
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,310
And because I've misunderstood you,
I'm leaving Bombay.

356
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,426
- Leaving Bombay?
- Yes!

357
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,826
- Now, what will I tell dadaji?
- Now, you be quick!

358
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,006
- Be quick!
- Just listen to me, please. Just once?

359
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,710
Listen, please.
I'm making a request...

360
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,560
Is she a girl, or what?
Talk, and she wants to bite!

361
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,730
What will I tell dadaji now?

362
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,896
- Hello!
- Oh, hello.

363
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,120
Oh, hello.

364
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,790
What's your opinion
of Ashok Kumar?

365
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,640
Mummy, he isn't going to fall
into your trap.

366
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,896
There's only one Ashok Kumar
on the silver screen.

367
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,616
Listen, he recognizes
which way the wind blows.

368
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,440
He's an experienced hand.

369
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,570
He will chew up both mother
and daughter and spit you out.

370
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,740
"I'm a lover of gardens, I...

371
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,620
love not only the flowers"

372
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,460
- Again...
- Haai...

373
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:22,870
"I continue to be faithful
to the thorns as well"

374
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,246
If you consider me a thorn,
then why do you come?

375
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,350
Because thorns are better
than flowers...

376
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,390
they cling to you.

377
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,210
And I prefer to play with
venomous snakes.

378
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,470
A venomous snake saves
her poison for everyone...

379
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,980
but she keeps her love
for her mate.

380
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,020
- And who's that lucky mate?
- You.

381
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,120
Me? A snake?

382
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:02,720
You're right. Since we're
birds of a feather...

383
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,580
we can't deceive each other.

384
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,840
But Dilip?

385
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,220
You're marrying him, aren't you?

386
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,090
Not him, Ashok. I'm
marrying his wealth.

387
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,880
Wealth that you can't provide,
and love that he can't give me.

388
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,950
This is why I'll marry him...

389
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,220
- and find love with you.
- Bravo!

390
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,590
You truly are a poisonous snake.

391
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,650
But you have a strange,
seductive charm.

392
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,850
The slow, sweet, intoxicating
charm of poison.

393
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,120
It's these sweet words that have
won Nayantara over.

394
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,230
But I never know if
you're speaking the truth, or...

395
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,890
playing games.

396
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,620
But even if it is a game...

397
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:49,040
- it is a beautiful game.
- Don't come so close, my innocent snake.

398
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,150
Sometimes, even in play,
there's peril.

399
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,960
But didn't you say this is life?

400
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,120
Baby...

401
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,760
Dilip had called just now to say
he's coming over.

402
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,240
Behold the hunter
unwittingly ensnared.

403
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:10,080
Poor Dilip is doomed today.

404
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,310
Take care of yourself, my lord.

405
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,720
"'Tis a mirror? Or a killer
confronting a killer?

406
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,880
I fear lest they fight,
killers both"

407
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,930
- Thank you!
- Alright, you get ready to greet your prey.

408
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,070
I shall take your leave.
Good bye!

409
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,290
Some die of envy

410
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,370
Some embrace the gallows

411
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,100
How many have fevered hearts?

412
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,266
When, today, the news
spread like wildfire

413
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,430
That you and I, I and you,
have fallen in love

414
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:38,400
Breaking the shackles of this world,
lo, our hearts beat as one

415
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:50,600
When our eyes met,
flowers bloomed in the garden

416
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,380
Our loved ones are vexed

417
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,650
People are annoyed

418
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,276
And the world turned against us

419
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,526
When, today, the news
spread like wildfire

420
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,576
That you and I, I and you
have fallen in love

421
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,840
We have fallen in love

422
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:46,290
These days are ours and so are
the nights to do with as we like

423
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:59,210
To go to work or stay at home,
send the doctor a small request

424
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,680
Be it Monday...

425
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,820
or Wednesday...

426
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:14,756
they have all turned
into Sundays for us

427
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,976
When, today, the news
spread like wildfire

428
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,156
That you and I, I and you
have fallen in love

429
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,240
We have fallen in love

430
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:35,950
Oh... you and I, I and you,
have fallen in love

431
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,596
Some die of envy.
Some embrace the gallows

432
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,626
How many have fevered hearts?

433
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,976
When, today, the news
spread like wildfire

434
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,026
That you and I, I and you
have fallen in love

435
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,320
We have fallen in love

436
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,790
Tell me, Dilip, how's your
dadaji's health?

437
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,630
Very bad. He may not survive.

438
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,630
Oh, lord! What happened?

439
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:14,910
But darling, you told me just
last night that he was fine.

440
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,096
Yes. But this morning,
he got up and said...

441
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,790
"Go get my bahurani.
My heart is ailing again."

442
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,540
Hurriedly, I went to Kiran.

443
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,590
But the damned woman insulted me
and threw me out of her room.

444
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,316
That's very unfortunate.
Why don't you try once more?

445
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,940
- Perhaps she may agree?
- But who am I going to ask?

446
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,190
Thank you, darling. By now,
she must have left Bombay.

447
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,640
And I don't know what
I'm going to tell dadaji now.

448
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:43,216
- What did you say? She left Bombay?
- Yes, that's what she said.

449
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,650
Hear that, Baby? She left Bombay.
Mummy, she's gone.

450
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,220
- Here comes the twist!
- Please, Director...

451
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,210
This time, employ the twist with care.
I mean, it should be a great one!

452
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,300
- Yesterday's twist nearly overthrew my plans.
- Look, Mr. Dilip...

453
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,186
you're insulting my 8 years of experience
as assistant director and writer!

454
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,445
- I've assisted 14 directors.
- Exactly! - My dear sir...

455
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:11,006
I'll insert such a twist,
worthy of a silver jubilee!

456
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,695
You'll be thrilled
when you hear it.

457
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,599
I'm already thrilled before
hearing it. Tell me!

458
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:17,859
- At least, listen to him.
- Alright, tell me. - Okay, then listen!

459
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,425
- Look, first, get a doctor to prick you with a needle.
- Needle?

460
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:25,086
Yes, it's also called an
'injection' in English.

461
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,796
- I've to take an injection? - Yes.
- But it's dadaji who is ill!

462
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,990
There's no need to worry,
Mr. Dilip. It's just pretence.

463
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,860
Look, it's 10 o'clock now.

464
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,840
You get the injection and
return home by noon.

465
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:40,929
How? Ah... with bare feet,
dishevelled hair...

466
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,580
a mournful face,
tears in your eyes...

467
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,010
the ash from a funeral pyre
in your hands, and...

468
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:50,559
and, go to your dadaji
in this state.

469
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:53,776
Tell dadaji... tell... Write!

470
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,660
Assistant, write down whatever
I'm saying. It's very important!

471
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:00,450
Say, sobbing quietly,
trembling all the while...

472
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,980
with a few hiccups, say...

473
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:07,040
Dadaji... my dear dadaji...

474
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:12,770
your bahurani fell
seriously ill last night.

475
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,510
And, this morning, she...

476
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,950
passed away, leaving us all bereft.

477
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,360
- Mummy!
- How about it!

478
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,540
Oh, thank you, Director,
bless you! Darling!

479
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,210
- Where're you going, Kiran?
- To Rai Bahadur's house. - Why?

480
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:38,630
I'll tell him all about his splendid
grandson's dark deeds!

481
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,260
Let him discover...

482
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,571
the consquences of fooling around
with a respectable girl.

483
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,290
- But...
- You don't understand, Malti.

484
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,810
Rai Bahadur is my dadaji's friend.
I can't deceive him.

485
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,740
- Welcome, welcome, bahurani...
- Welcome. - Please come in.

486
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,440
Oh, Rajju babu... it's you.

487
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,480
- Why? Do you mind?
- Not at all!

488
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,476
I thought bahurani had arrived.

489
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,970
Bahurani?
I see!

490
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,326
Dilip bhaiyya [brother] has turned out
to be a fast worker.

491
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,646
Nanaji [grandfather] died...

492
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,796
and he's already brought his wife
home? Bravo, my friend!

493
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,930
Nanaji is not dead.
He's very much alive.

494
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,700
He's alive? Then why send me
a telegram calling me here?

495
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,126
The telegram made it seem like
he would die any moment...

496
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,600
and he's hale and hearty here?
Is this a joke?

497
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,226
Look, send my luggage
and mattress upstairs.

498
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,910
And pay the taxi driver's fare.

499
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,600
"Pay the taxi driver's
fare!" Hmph!

500
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,036
Why has the fool turned besotted?

501
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:53,940
Arre, so full of life today, you have to
go tomorrow... Oh, nana!

502
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,166
Why, Rajju! Since when have you
turned into a saint?

503
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,756
What can I say, nanaji?

504
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,890
- This song is popular during funerals nowadays.
- But I'm alive.

505
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,090
- That is why I'm crying.
- You donkey! Making fun of your grandfather!

506
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,040
Nanaji, who is this 'bahurani'?

507
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,580
Come closer. I'll tell you.

508
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,610
Look, there she comes.

509
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:50,010
[A song welcoming
a new bride home.]

510
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,970
You've come at last, bahurani.

511
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,116
Do you know how long
we've been waiting for you?

512
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,130
Dadaji, look at all these people!

513
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,860
They are all old retainers.

514
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,720
This house hasn't witnessed a
happy occasion for years.

515
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,570
As soon as you arrived, the house
sparkled with happiness.

516
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,040
Yes, go on, all of you.
Go celebrate this joy.

517
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,410
Rajju...

518
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,040
- This is my bahurani.
- She's out of this world.

519
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,316
- This is my grandson.
- Rajju.

520
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,666
Nanaji thinks I'm mad.
I'm not mad.

521
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:31,690
[Mutters a string of
incomprehensible nonsense.]

522
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,260
Come. Come, my dear. Come.

523
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:47,300
Come, my dear. You've truly come
into my house like a ray of light.

524
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,470
- Oh... I...
- But, where did Dilip go?

525
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,850
He'd gone to bring you here.

526
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,016
Yes... yes, he did
come to me.

527
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,630
But I threw him out.

528
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,620
- And I've come to tell you that...
- No, no, no! There's nothing to say.

529
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,490
You did the right thing
by throwing him out.

530
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,020
Do sit down.

531
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,850
You did the right thing
by throwing him out.

532
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:18,740
But you will have to
reform that fool, my dear.

533
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,630
Arre, you are incorrigible,
Rai Bahadur saheb.

534
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,050
Meaning, my lord is out of
his bed in his condition!

535
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:32,120
So... what do you think of
my bahurani?

536
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,346
Her footsteps herald prosperity...

537
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:37,766
and she brings the elixir of life
in her hands, doctor!

538
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:41,720
- I don't need any medicines.
- That's true, bahurani.

539
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,050
You have given our Rai Bahadur
a new lease on life.

540
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,070
Now, understand this, my child...

541
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,450
his life and death are
in your hands.

542
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,210
What? In my hands?

543
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,160
Make her understand, Doctor.

544
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,340
Make my silly daughter-in-law
understand this very well indeed.

545
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,400
That from today,
she has to feed me...

546
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,366
sing for me...

547
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,910
and entertain me in
every possible manner.

548
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:12,390
- Please try and understand what I'm saying.
- I understood, my dear.

549
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:16,566
You want to say that the
two of you squabbled today...

550
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,946
and now you don't want to
marry him. Is that not so?

551
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,530
- No, not exactly.
- Not exactly?

552
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,900
Oh, I understood now! When you're
not against the marriage...

553
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,990
then why bother about
anything else? Right, Doctor?

554
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,640
Is the plague spreading in your locality,
Doctor? Oh, gently, please.

555
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,950
Thank you, Doctor.

556
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:47,040
In love, this is always
a puzzle...

557
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,926
When a husband and wife agree
what's a priest to do?

558
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,420
- When... - Listen!
- Who? Me? I won't listen.

559
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:59,906
- Why?
- Anyone who tells me, 'Please come', 'Please go'...

560
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:03,500
'Please sit down', 'Please listen',
I don't talk to them.

561
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,836
What a monkey!

562
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,790
Ha! Now, you've
fallen in line.

563
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,410
What's the matter?

564
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:16,270
- Please rescue me from this mess.
- But, what's the matter?

565
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,990
- No one here listens to anything I say.
- Really?

566
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,420
- I'll listen.
- Yesterday, Dilip babu deceived me and brought me here.

567
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,770
And dadaji believes... that...

568
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,960
- that I'm really...
- That you're really his future daughter-in-law?

569
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,906
Perfect! What a wonderful situation!

570
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,560
- And then?
- Now, only you can resolve this dilemma.

571
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,070
- You must clarify something.
- What?

572
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,330
You're not in love with anyone else,
are you? Look, tell me the truth.

573
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,386
- I don't get involved in such matters.
- Very good. Excellent!

574
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:03,356
So, listen to me. The old man
is a decent bloke.

575
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,896
And Dilip bhaiyya doesn't have
any major flaws either.

576
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,570
It's just that he has
one screw loose too.

577
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,840
Think about it.

578
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,380
How would it be if you actually became
the bahurani of this house?

579
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,840
Arre... what's this?

580
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:38,600
Come here. Come to me.

581
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,470
Arre, where did you
get this ash from?

582
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,850
- What's this? - lnjection.
- Injection?

583
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,760
- What sort of injection?
- Against plague. - Against plague?

584
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,380
- What are you saying?
- How do I say this, dadaji?

585
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,200
- Yesterday, after she left here, Kiran succumbed to the plague.
- Who did?

586
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:06,080
Kiran. Your future daughter-in-law.

587
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:13,250
- What do you mean?
- My heart is breaking as I say this, dadaji.

588
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:16,520
When I went to pick her up
this morning, then...

589
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:21,186
- she was still alive. - Oh.
- As if to meet me one last time...

590
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,730
- Tch, tch, tch...
- she was holding on to her last breath.

591
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,820
- And then?
- And then...

592
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,240
holding both my hands
in hers, she said...

593
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,900
it's our last meeting in life.

594
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,670
But, she said, "I'll be eagerly waiting
for you in the afterlife."

595
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:41,480
And, she said, "Pay my respects to
your dadaji and say..." and say...

596
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,660
What did she ask you to tell me?

597
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,126
The unfortunate girl could do
nothing for you.

598
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,950
She would regret that
even after her death.

599
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,210
- And... and...
- And what?

600
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,940
And then two final tears
fell from her eyes...

601
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:55,540
- and... and...
- Speak, my son, tell me.

602
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:58,650
- And... Dadaji!
- Don't cry.

603
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,020
Don't cry, my child.

604
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,150
My heart is breaking.

605
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:09,290
But, please, lift your head, tell me
what happened next? Then?

606
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,760
- Now, speak up, what happened next?
- Then... then... - Yes, yes?

607
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,460
- Then... - Then?
- Then I woke up...

608
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:34,526
- What happened, sir? Headache?
- You've to have a head for it to ache!

609
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,740
I don't have a head, Matadeen.
I've become crazy.

610
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,910
This is what happens when
you're in love, sir.

611
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,716
Your condition is similar to mine.

612
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,920
Similar condition?
What do you mean?

613
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,990
I swear upon my youth, your condition
is exactly like mine.

614
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:50,870
After our wedding...

615
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,120
when, for the first time,
the thakurain...

616
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:57,100
lifted her veil and glanced
sideways at me...

617
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,100
my head spun so crazily...

618
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,450
it never returned to its
rightful place. And, sir...

619
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:05,980
my wife felt so shy
upon seeing me...

620
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,926
her sideways glance never
straightened ever again.

621
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:12,666
- Nonsense! - Sir?
- All of you will drive me mad.

622
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,320
- Eh?
- Nayantara! My beloved Nayantara...

623
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,380
He's gone crazy. His condition is
exactly like mine.

624
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,980
Nayantara? Who's this Nayantara?

625
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,100
- Didn't you understand?
- Eh?

626
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,890
- It is bahurani's nickname.
- Oh...

627
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:37,836
'Nayantara' means
'the star of your eyes'.

628
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,610
Nayantara, don't pierce me with
the arrows of your gaze...

629
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:46,310
You are not my Nayantara,
you're my tanpura.

630
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,420
Please permit me to leave.

631
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,300
Permit you to leave?
So soon?

632
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:57,080
- Yes, it's time for my tuitions; I teach a girl.
- Wow!

633
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,440
I was looking for a teacher too.

634
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:04,760
- You were looking for a teacher?
- Yes, I need a very strict one.

635
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:07,866
I'm very strict. My students
always fear me.

636
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,800
But these children are very mischievous.

637
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,410
In fact, one of them is
an absolute donkey.

638
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,306
You may not be able to handle him.

639
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:17,256
You just watch, I will manage
very well indeed.

640
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,010
But I need a teacher who can
stay here day and night.

641
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:27,070
If it's a respectable house, and
the salary is good, I'll accept it.

642
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:31,470
The house is respectable indeed...

643
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:34,850
and you will get whatever salary
you ask for.

644
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,720
But, where are the kids?

645
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:41,580
- One is right here, in front of you.
- What, you?

646
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:46,776
And the other is Dilip,
who is a big donkey.

647
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,356
- No sir, I don't want this job.
- No, no, no, no, no!

648
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:53,106
You can't refuse an offer
after agreeing to it.

649
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:55,606
That's not allowed!

650
00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:00,100
- Man, I don't know if she's told dadaji everything or not.
- No.

651
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,540
Then why's she here?

652
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:07,620
- She's in love with you.
- She's in what with me?

653
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:12,810
- Bhai, she's fallen in love with you.
- In love with me, indeed! Rubbish.

654
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:15,896
Then, you think she comes here
for the love of Matadeen?

655
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,496
But, she insulted me.

656
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,366
Yesterday, she flung the money at
me; today, she chased me out like a dog.

657
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:24,926
I tell you, if she hadn't been a girl,
I would have strangled her!

658
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:28,000
- Like this? - Like this.
- What's going on here?

659
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:32,510
- Nothing, dadaji, he's a friend.
- Come here.

660
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:39,230
- Did you apologize to my bahurani?
- No.

661
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,780
- Then go. Apologize now.
- But, dadaji...

662
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,140
No ifs and buts.
Go right now.

663
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:59,440
Bhaiyya! Oh, bhaiyya...

664
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,616
Nanaji's intentions don't
seem to be good.

665
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,640
He'll surely eavesdrop
on your conversation.

666
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,830
So enact the pretence
of love well.

667
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:11,216
- Hmm?
- Your drama of love.

668
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,880
- [Muttering a string of nonsense.]
- [... ]

669
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,100
Dadaji is outside, listening
to our conversation...

670
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,030
so, respond fondly to
my affection. Alright?

671
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,070
Baby?

672
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,080
Baby biscuit?

673
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:18,456
B... b... biscuit? Do you want
to eat some biscuits?

674
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,840
I'll buy you a packet when we
go out in the evening. Okay?

675
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,920
Children relish eating it.

676
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:27,266
- But, where do I have a child?
- Child? Oh, we will... we will.

677
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:30,376
When we get married, God will
shower his blessings on us. Right?

678
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,796
Have you gone mad?

679
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:34,970
- Men become mad when they fall in love, darling.
- Darling?

680
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,290
Who gave you the right
to address me like that?

681
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:39,760
Who gives this right to anyone?

682
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,660
When you're in love, this right is
automatically conferred on you.

683
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,940
What are you saying?

684
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:48,920
Why are you winking?

685
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:52,100
The fact is, Kiran, from the moment
I set eyes on you...

686
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:56,380
my eyes have increased their movement
in tandem with my heartbeats.

687
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:01,090
Please stop being so annoyed now.
You know how much I love you!

688
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,340
Dilip babu!

689
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,890
Listen, Kiran... just listen
to me once, before you go.

690
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:10,420
No man can tear his heart out
to prove his love.

691
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:14,530
And not everyone has the words
to express his feelings.

692
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,176
Then, how can you reject my
true love and leave this house?

693
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,940
Dilip babu! It is true
that I'm poor.

694
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,410
But I love my self-respect
no less than anyone.

695
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:26,800
Finding me alone at home,
please don't insult me.

696
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:39,410
All this while, like a fool, I was
pretending to be in love with you.

697
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,560
I apologize for that.

698
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,600
And, you didn't say
anything to Dadaji.

699
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,400
I'll always be grateful
to you for that too.

700
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,900
Now please say you aren't
annoyed with me.

701
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,420
"Now, please say you
aren't annoyed with me."

702
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,220
When someone speaks so lovingly,

703
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,180
can anyone remain angry?

704
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,540
The night brought me...

705
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:27,410
The night brought to me
such sweet dreams

706
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:31,780
And in those dreams,
came my beloved to me

707
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:53,580
Slumbered I, deep in
the world of dreams

708
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:09,706
Lost, I wandered in
the Land of Sleep

709
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:14,000
When someone came
and awakened me

710
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:24,130
My beloved came to me in the
dreams the night brought me

711
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:56,360
Slowly, stealthily,
into my castle he crept

712
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:11,150
Slowly, quietly, lifting
my veil, someone...

713
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:16,410
softly hummed a melody
in my ears

714
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:26,570
My beloved came to me in the
dreams the night brought me

715
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:31,950
The night brought to me
such sweet dreams

716
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:36,100
And in those dreams,
came my beloved to me

717
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,790
Now wake up, Your Majesty!
Your maid has brought you tea.

718
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,480
Thank you!

719
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,230
What's the matter?

720
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,860
You seem very happy!
Whom are you thinking of?

721
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:16,930
- You!
- Ah! I died [from happiness].

722
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:20,340
At least raise your eyes
and look at me.

723
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:25,780
It seems...

724
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,300
"My beloved came to me
in my dreams"

725
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,960
- Go away!
- I'll go away, alright.

726
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:34,826
But the person who should
go away, won't.

727
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:37,346
Until he weds you
and carries you away...

728
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:38,990
he won't be at peace.

729
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,940
- Who?
- Shall I tell you?

730
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,380
Why are you feeling shy now?

731
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:47,650
You don't know, Malti, Rai Bahadur
has made me promise...

732
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:50,690
- that I will reform him.
- 'Him?' Which 'him'?

733
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:53,970
- 'Him'.
- Oh ho!

734
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:56,996
That miserable wretch who, until
yesterday, was a fraud and a madman...

735
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,010
- is 'him' today?
- Oh, go away!

736
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:11,270
- I have to go, Malti.
- Bahurani!

737
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:31,560
Child! My dear child, I've brought
your tea. May I come in?

738
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:35,900
Go away! Coming here, banging
doors, in the middle of the night!

739
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,460
"I've brought you
your tea, my child!"

740
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,060
How is this my fault?

741
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,360
Those were bahurani's orders!

742
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:47,760
The tea is getting cold, my child.
May I bring it in?

743
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:55,540
Don't you come in, beware!
I'm telling you to go away!

744
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,050
Go away, you witch! And listen...
close the door.

745
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,290
Haven't you gone yet? You witch!
You cross-eyed...

746
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:06,096
I don't wish to see your face.
The whole day will be ruined.

747
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,420
Going or not?

748
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:10,740
You?!

749
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:15,700
- Forgive me.
- Excuse me, I didn't know that...

750
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:18,740
- a glimpse of my face ruins your entire day.
- Not at all... she...

751
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:21,240
- Child... Cross-eyed... Witch... I...
- Listen...

752
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:24,530
It's Dadaji's orders that, from tomorrow,
you should be at breakfast at 8a.m.

753
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,580
- Why are you shouting unnecessarily?
- Get lost!

754
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:42,340
Unnecessarily...

755
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:45,840
why are you...

756
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:49,790
sitting and shouting...

757
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:53,900
the entire day?

758
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,820
Unnecessarily...

759
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:05,360
Why do you, unnecessarily,
keep shouting the entire day?

760
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,510
- Left. Left. Left, Right...
- Halt!

761
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:18,566
Get up slowly, go have a bath
in the bathroom

762
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:22,210
Soap yourself with Hamam or Lux,
and clean yourself well

763
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:28,200
Free yourself from your bed,
your breakfast is ready for you

764
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:36,920
Bhabhi [Sister-in-law] is waiting,
oh lazy one!

765
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:43,996
Why do you... Why do you...
Why do you lose your nerve?

766
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,826
And keep shouting?

767
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:51,096
Why do you, unnecessarily,
keep shouting the entire day?

768
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,350
Unnecessarily...

769
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,280
Why is this girl here, again?

770
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:04,246
Nana is up to his tricks,
he messed it all up

771
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:07,420
I don't understand anything

772
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,366
Nanaji has quite easily
plotted and schemed

773
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:25,210
Nanaji has schemed and plotted,
so my child, beware

774
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:33,176
Be careful, this young lady has
come to teach you a lesson

775
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,050
A cat is a 'billi',
a rat is a 'chooha'

776
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:41,496
L-O... L-O-V-E...
L-O-V-E means 'love'

777
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,350
Love means romance,
romance means...

778
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:58,140
Oh my God! What
shall we do now?

779
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:04,360
Go, pretend you are
truly in love

780
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:09,190
Heave a few woeful sighs

781
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:18,910
And, maddened by
your love for her...

782
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:25,630
live a little, die a little

783
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:29,690
Die... die...

784
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:43,136
Listen to me and you will
achieve your goal

785
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,120
Or you will find your boat
wrecked mid-stream

786
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:54,206
I've made my decision,
now let me see your mettle

787
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:59,966
Oh wrestler, oh champion

788
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:04,680
Why do you... why do you...
Why do you lose your nerve?

789
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,560
And keep shouting?

790
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:11,656
Why do you, unnecessarily,
keep shouting the entire day?

791
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:19,150
Go... on... shouting...

792
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:40,060
Hello? For the young master?

793
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,890
May I have your name?
Oh, I understand, yes.

794
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:48,120
I'll call him right away.
Please hold.

795
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,570
Nayantara!

796
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:54,380
- I'll come right away!
- Arre, not you.

797
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,680
Bahurani is calling from...

798
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,740
the upper floor for
the young master.

799
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:05,390
Your telephone call rings
in my heart 24 hours a day.

800
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:11,090
Hello? Sir...

801
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:14,350
- it's bahurani's call for you.
- Hello?

802
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:18,180
- What did you say?
- Shall I say it again?

803
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,270
- Darling!
- Don't you dare call me darling!

804
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,600
I've begun to understand
your schemes and intrigue.

805
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,480
Darling! How can you say this
to your Nayantara...

806
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,200
Nayan! Nayan, darling, uh...

807
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:33,130
Oh... Nayan, darling.

808
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:36,740
I'll... that stupid Matadeen...

809
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:40,800
- Why did God make you so beautiful...
- Matadeen!

810
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,616
- Sir?
- Why didn't you tell me the call was from Nayantara?

811
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,350
- That's what I said, sir.
- But, you said bahurani had phoned?

812
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,820
- Exactly, sir...
"Exactly!" Remember...

813
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:52,240
Bahurani's name is Kiran,
not Nayantara.

814
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:55,520
I know very well, sir...

815
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,770
that 'Nayantara' is
bahurani's pet name.

816
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:00,620
Absolutely hopeless!

817
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:06,470
Hello? Bahurani! Bahurani...

818
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,850
Hello? Please forgive me, darling.

819
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:18,160
Darling? What's the matter
with you?

820
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:21,780
How do I tell you what's happening!
My head's spinning; I'm going crazy.

821
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,650
My cure lies in your hands now.

822
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:27,580
Yes, indeed. Don't worry...

823
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:31,470
I'll give you such a medicine that
you will return to your senses.

824
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,980
I've been hired just to treat you.

825
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:38,110
And listen, lunch is ready.
Eat before you leave.

826
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,960
What a mess you've landed in,
Dilip, my son!

827
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,680
Sometimes, Kiran calls;
sometimes, Nayantara does.

828
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,520
Hello?

829
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:58,800
Hello?

830
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:02,746
Cut the call, Mummy.
I don't want to talk to him.

831
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:05,376
Baby, you must be mistaken.
This can never happen.

832
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,606
- But, Mummy...
- Darling, I've sent for Chagan too.

833
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:12,680
- But, listen to me. Talk to Dilip once more.
- Alright.

834
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,990
- Hello?
- Hello.

835
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:19,576
I've just rubbed my nose
in the dirt...

836
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,350
held my ears, folded my hands...

837
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,500
- yet I get no relief?
- What do you mean, Dilip?

838
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,840
I already told you
I've gone mad.

839
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:29,570
Now, if you still want to kill me,
tell me, shall I poison myself?

840
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:32,690
Dilip! Have you become so
upset with your Nayantara?

841
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:34,830
Nayan! Nayantara!

842
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:38,220
For God's sake, please swear
that you're truly Nayantara.

843
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,080
I swear upon God I am Nayantara.

844
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,340
- What's the matter with you today?
- Forgive me, Nayan.

845
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:46,510
I was deceived into
swearing at you.

846
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:49,690
What did you say?
7 p.m.?

847
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,790
I'll surely come. Yes.

848
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:56,040
Rivoli Theater?
Yes, bye, darling.

849
01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:01,556
What can I do, memsaab? The
young master's cat ate two chops.

850
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:05,820
Listen! I'm extremely
grateful to you...

851
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:09,050
but that doesn't mean you forget
that I'm the owner of this house.

852
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,980
- And you...
- I work in this house. Now what?

853
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:16,490
When I'm the employer, if I wish,
I can... you...

854
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:18,910
can make you the
Mistress of this house.

855
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:23,630
Truthfully, Kiran, you have transformed
this house in just one day.

856
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:28,580
Now I realize why
I love you so much!

857
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:32,810
Ah, dadaji!

858
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,320
Please come. Have some lunch.

859
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:46,980
- You know, Rajju... - Yes?
- According to Darwin...

860
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:50,110
man evolved from
the monkey. But...

861
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:54,580
has anyone ever said that a donkey
can also evolve into a human?

862
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,130
I... I... I don't know.
I've never been to school.

863
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,340
Didn't you understand, Dadaji?
She's making fun of me.

864
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,360
No.

865
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:09,160
Arre, taste it and you will see
it's cooked very well.

866
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:27,470
Dilip! In the afternoon...

867
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:31,070
please go to the market. Certain
things need to be bought.

868
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:35,026
- What should I buy, dadaji?
- Kiran has already made a list.

869
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:38,110
That's fine, then. Please show it
to me after lunch. Okay?

870
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:52,560
Bhabhi, show me your palm.

871
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:55,016
Oh, so my lord reads
palms as well.

872
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,280
- Tell me what the lines say.
- Yes, of course.

873
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:04,496
The lines on your palm
clearly show that you...

874
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,236
have returned from peeking
into bhaiyya's room.

875
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:08,490
Ha! My sandals went
into your brother's room.

876
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:13,466
Not just your sandals;
your feet went inside too.

877
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:17,690
Your body, your soul, why,
even your heart went inside.

878
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:20,800
Cross your heart and
tell me if I'm lying?

879
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:24,110
I only went in to see how much
longer he would be.

880
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:28,850
Indeed. The poor guy is going to be
in a deep mess today.

881
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:34,946
This line clearly shows
that your student will...

882
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:37,096
pull wool over your eyes
and flee.

883
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,520
- Huh! I've taken the measure of many such!
- Wait and watch.

884
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,210
- Hey! Rajju...
- Hey, come here.

885
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,160
Bhai, the teacher is
going with you too.

886
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,790
- Why?
- It's all a part of nanaji's plan.

887
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,780
- Nanaji's plan?
- Yes.

888
01:07:55,730 --> 01:08:00,410
- Really? Then I'm badly stuck!
- Indeed you are. - I...

889
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,680
Hey, take care of this.

890
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:32,210
All the items on your list
have been purchased, right?

891
01:08:33,069 --> 01:08:35,146
- Okay. - Okay.
- And you?

892
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:37,990
I just remembered an important
chore. Please let dada know.

893
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:40,900
You will be delayed unnecessarily.
You leave, I'll take a cab.

894
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,170
- Taxi!
- How late will you be back in the evening?

895
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,875
Around 10-15 minutes at the most.
I'll be right back.

896
01:08:46,899 --> 01:08:50,789
Then why do you need a taxi?
I can wait 10-15 minutes for you.

897
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,840
- Come. - Alright, let's go,
- Come, come on. Let's go.

898
01:09:22,609 --> 01:09:25,176
Oh ho, welcome!
Welcome, Dilip saaheb.

899
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,430
- We've been waiting for you for a long time.
- Come. - Let's go.

900
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:31,350
Side, side, side, side...
[Moving people along.]

901
01:09:37,109 --> 01:09:39,099
Hello, Dilip, you've come at last.

902
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,280
Yes.

903
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,610
So, you are Mr. Dilip.

904
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:52,150
He is Mr. Ashok Kumar.

905
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:55,050
A leading star in
our world of films.

906
01:09:55,690 --> 01:10:00,340
Arre, I'm not a star, just a tiny moth
drawn to this sparkling candle.

907
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:04,096
The candle burns, the moth
flutters around it...

908
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,470
and the night passes gently by.

909
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:10,020
- Come, Dilip...
- Yes, come in, do come in.

910
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:12,730
- The candle burns for everyone.
- No, thank you.

911
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:18,540
Don't be so childish, Dilip. How long
have I been waiting for you?

912
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:42,210
- Wow! What can I say?
- I was praising Nayantara's dance.

913
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:45,630
Her moves today have really driven
the entire world crazy.

914
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:48,620
- What do you think?
- Not crazy.

915
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:51,760
Foolish.

916
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:56,930
Yes, foolish. Moths are foolish;
that's why they self-immolate.

917
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,400
- Cigar?
- No, thank you.

918
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:12,180
- Okay, Nayan.
- Why? Leaving already?

919
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,140
Yes... Dilip babu
is waiting for you.

920
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,540
- Sit, Dilip.
- Is there any need to sit now?

921
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:33,510
- Why? What happened?
- Why? Did nothing happen?

922
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:35,660
You're upset about
such a silly matter?

923
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,600
I was just making a fool
of Ashok Kumar.

924
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,560
Ashok Kumar? Or me?

925
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:44,660
Dilip! What are you implying?

926
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:46,920
Please let me know, today...

927
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,240
whether you love me, or not.

928
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,970
I can be a fool, Nayan...

929
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:55,850
but not unfaithful.

930
01:11:57,290 --> 01:12:00,060
Dilip is yours as long as
you truly love him.

931
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:01,610
Darling!

932
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,160
Okay, I'll go take my seat.
You get ready.

933
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:10,710
But, you must drop me home
after the show, hmm?

934
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:09,910
Thank you.

935
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:13,800
- Whar's the matter, Dilip babu?
- Nothing.

936
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,570
- Did the moth die?
- No, the candle was extinguished.

937
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:26,920
I hope your prey didn't escape.

938
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,610
A prey escape Nayantara's snare?

939
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:33,950
Let's see what strength there is
in the executioner's arms.

940
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:38,600
- Nayan? - Hmm?
- Don't you feel any pity?

941
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:43,350
Don't be scared. Nayantara's heart
can never love Dilip.

942
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:45,070
That scares me more.

943
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:48,230
- That the poor chap may find this a very expensive bargain.
- So what?

944
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:50,690
I want to become a heroine
by hook or crook.

945
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,220
And only Dilip can provide
the necessary finances.

946
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:55,760
The poor man loves me very much.

947
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:58,690
Okay.

948
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:09,930
- Has the master come in?
- Yes.

949
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,120
Bring his things in.

950
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:17,980
She's pursuing me with
a vengeance! What a pain!

951
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:22,326
Why is she doing this?
Can you guess?

952
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:24,870
It's very simple.
She's fallen in love with you.

953
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:29,800
Kiran, in love with me? lmpossible.
Absolutely impossible.

954
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:35,120
- Why?
- How can Kiran love a fraudulent wretch like me?

955
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:41,000
Can any woman dislike the only
grandson of the Rai Bahadur?

956
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,990
That's not the case, Rajju.
I've observed her keenly.

957
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:50,460
Just so dadaji will not die if
my lies and deceit are revealed...

958
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:53,010
that's probably the reason
why she's still living here.

959
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,390
Or else, after our
very first meeting...

960
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,640
she would not have stepped
into this house again.

961
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:02,770
- What's come over you today?
- I don't know, myself.

962
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,440
But the more I think of her...

963
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,210
the more I feel drawn to her.

964
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:14,030
A candle must burn, whatever its
condition, until dawn appears...

965
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,890
Perhaps there will come a dawn
in my life too.

966
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:32,790
I've just known him awhile

967
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,010
Yet he now resides in my heart

968
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:40,860
What madness is this?

969
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:59,840
From the moment he became mine...

970
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:08,370
I've spun dreams during the day

971
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:12,170
What turmoil is this?

972
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:16,380
What madness is this?

973
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:39,920
Someone's defeat, someone's victory

974
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:48,860
isn't it strange,
the ways of this world?

975
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:57,080
The music echoes without a note

976
01:16:57,230 --> 01:17:00,800
What strange echoes are these?

977
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:05,170
What madness is this?

978
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:26,060
In the rose-hued dawn of life...

979
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:37,390
with the golden threads of light...

980
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:46,050
he comes to bind me,
who stole my heart

981
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:55,570
What bonds are these?

982
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:59,740
What madness is this?

983
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:31,930
Give this necklace to Nirmal's
daughter, along with my blessings.

984
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,210
- Yes, of course.
- And listen...

985
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,890
Munshi Ram Bahadur,
Manohar Lal...

986
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,710
Babu Shyam Kishore...

987
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:45,690
in short, meet all my
friends and relatives.

988
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:49,260
- And convey my greetings to all of them.
- I will.

989
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:07,570
- Here's your luggage, and here's the ticket.
- Thank you.

990
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,350
Arre, what's this?

991
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,280
I'm not going to Delhi
or anywhere else.

992
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:21,020
Are you repeating that madness
again? Come on, get up.

993
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,980
Look, someone has to go to Delhi.

994
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:28,470
- And instead of troubling your old dadaji...
- Why is it necessary to go?'

995
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:31,736
Shall I call dadaji? He will
explain it to you.'

996
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,226
Call dadaji, indeed! You have
dadaji on your side, so...

997
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:36,940
you keep saying, "Shall I call dadaji?"
for everything. Go call him!

998
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:40,556
Alright, let it be. What's
the point in sulking...

999
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:42,300
over such a minor thing?

1000
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:45,840
- You're going to attend a wedding. Go happily.
- I'm not getting married.

1001
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:50,060
Oh ho, so that's the problem!

1002
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:53,800
So eager to get married! I'll look for
a bride for you if you wish.

1003
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:57,000
No, thank you!
I'll find one myself.

1004
01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:01,070
Of course! You are an expert
in finding girls.

1005
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:05,750
- Please place this luggage in the car.
- Yes, of course.

1006
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:14,840
Please come, it's time
for your flight. Come on!

1007
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,690
- Namaste.
- Look...

1008
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,760
it's always colder outside
Bombay. Especially in Delhi.

1009
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:28,000
Take care of yourself,
in case you fall ill.

1010
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:30,840
Hey, if I fall ill or die,
why should you care?

1011
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:32,950
You will be free of me.

1012
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:34,990
How can you say such a thing
while leaving home?

1013
01:20:35,710 --> 01:20:37,990
I didn't know that you
would misunderstand me so.

1014
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:41,550
- Please go, I won't talk to you.
- Kiran!

1015
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,370
Kiran Devi...

1016
01:21:06,830 --> 01:21:08,130
Take it away.

1017
01:21:09,790 --> 01:21:12,670
Saab, a gentleman in that car
is calling you.

1018
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:14,810
Indeed.

1019
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:21,210
Oh, you!

1020
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:27,210
- Listen, Dilip!
- There's nothing left to hear.

1021
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:29,700
- Please listen to me!
- I see no need to.

1022
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,670
What has happened to you?

1023
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:35,890
I've been calling you
the last couple of days...

1024
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,350
yet, you neither speak to me...

1025
01:21:38,450 --> 01:21:40,400
nor come to meet me.

1026
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:43,700
Stop acting, Nayan.

1027
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,260
- This is not the stage.
- Dilip!

1028
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,546
Arre re... Dilip babu!
Dilip babu!

1029
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:01,716
- Dilip babu, what have you done?
- What happened?

1030
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:05,126
Didn't you understand? Oh, when
will you understand her feelings?

1031
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:09,726
Dilip babu, for the last 2 days, she's
been carrying poison to kill herself.

1032
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,836
- A bottle of poison? - Yes.
- No... No! - Please come!

1033
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,976
Come quickly, or it will be a mess.
Mr. Khamakha, quick!

1034
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,996
- Keep his luggage. Keep it!
- But, my plane!

1035
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:19,040
To hell with the plane, Dilip babu;
you can catch another flight.

1036
01:22:19,210 --> 01:22:22,610
But once Nayantara is dead, she
cannot be revived. Please come.

1037
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:25,870
Quick, Mr. Khamakha,
come quickly.

1038
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:43,600
Nayan! Nayan, darling,
open the door!

1039
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:47,140
Oh, no! Nayan!
Dilip, my dear!

1040
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:49,496
- I'm ruined. - What happened?
- Nayan has killed herself.

1041
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,356
- She isn't alive anymore.
- What're you saying, Mummy?

1042
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:53,880
Nayan! Nayan, open the door!

1043
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:56,356
It's Dilip. Dilip!
Open the door, darling.

1044
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:59,156
- This is Dilip!
- Dilip, I told you.

1045
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:01,886
I told you she would
consume poison. She did!

1046
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,310
What will happen now?

1047
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:07,610
- Be careful! Be careful, Dilip!
- Dilip!

1048
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:15,836
Nayan! Leave it!

1049
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:18,446
- Leave it! - No! - What madness is this!
- No! - Leave it! - No! No!

1050
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:20,270
Leave it! Foolish girl!

1051
01:23:21,770 --> 01:23:25,380
Nayan... don't cry, Nayan.

1052
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,370
Forgive me, darling.

1053
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:33,580
Tell me you won't go anywhere
leaving me alone.

1054
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:37,290
I've to go to Delhi
for five days.

1055
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:40,210
- I've to attend a relative's wedding.
- No.

1056
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:43,286
- Try to understand, darling.
- No. - Just five days.

1057
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:45,180
- No! No! No!
- Nayan, do listen.

1058
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:48,296
- Nayan! Darling!
- Dilip babu! What happened?

1059
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,946
Director saab,
please explain to her.

1060
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:51,660
I've to go for just five days.

1061
01:23:51,710 --> 01:23:54,350
A relative is getting married in Delhi.
Please make her understand.

1062
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:56,266
Why don't you simply poison her...

1063
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:57,896
and go to Delhi, happily?

1064
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,720
But it's imperative that
I go, Director saab.

1065
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:02,436
Dilip babu, if your
relative's wedding...

1066
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:04,046
is more important than Nayantara's life...

1067
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:06,166
- then, you may go happily.
- You don't understand. I...

1068
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:09,410
I understand everything. Listen to me;
stay here quietly for 5 days.

1069
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:13,306
Later, when she's better, you can
go home on the fifth day.

1070
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:15,606
- This is sheer deception!
- But what a sweet deception.

1071
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:19,056
Nayantara's life, your love and
my prestige will all be saved.

1072
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,456
Three birds with one stone.
Three birds, Dilip babu..

1073
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:23,926
- As for the Delhi wedding, it can happen without you.
- But... - Ask me how?

1074
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:27,790
- But... - Shake hands. - But...
- Don't talk. Don't talk. Just console her. Go.

1075
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:30,780
Mummy... come here, please.

1076
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:34,220
Nayan!

1077
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:38,940
- Please listen to me, Nayan.
- Go away, I won't talk to you.

1078
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:41,990
Okay, I won't go
to Delhi. Happy?

1079
01:24:42,830 --> 01:24:45,270
- Truly?
- Now, please smile.

1080
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:49,380
- Oh, darling!
- How quickly you do get upset!

1081
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:20,880
Namaste, Dilip babu.

1082
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:25,050
You? Here? So late at night?

1083
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:28,800
Dilip was going to Delhi.
I'm holding him back here.

1084
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:32,430
- Like this.
- Oh, my! What a fortunate man.

1085
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:36,100
Or, who has the good fortune
to be bound by such love?

1086
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:39,780
Oh, Ashok? You?
At this hour?

1087
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:41,846
- Did you have a night shoot?
- No, Mummy.

1088
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:45,400
- I... - Dilip, come, my dear. Take a look at your room.
- Yes.

1089
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:53,610
Didn't you say you wouldn't
come today?

1090
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:59,260
But in my heart, I knew
you would surely come.

1091
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,390
So, you won this hand.

1092
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:07,270
Did you think I would lose?

1093
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:10,720
No. There's no question of
victory or defeat in this game.

1094
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:12,940
Some win, even when they lose...

1095
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:16,100
and some, winning everything, still lose.

1096
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:34,950
What're you looking at?

1097
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:40,710
- A spider's web. It's very beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes.

1098
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:45,490
Ashok, I have some bad news.

1099
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:50,750
Sometimes, I feel as if...

1100
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:54,280
Nayantara's heart will truly
fall in love with you.

1101
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:58,190
Smart people never love
with their hearts.

1102
01:26:58,810 --> 01:27:01,400
They always use
their brains. And...

1103
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,230
you're reasonably smart.

1104
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:06,820
- Which is why I say it's bad news.
- Extremely.

1105
01:27:07,230 --> 01:27:08,830
But, what's the reason for this?

1106
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:14,260
That I have no need
to make a fool of you.

1107
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:17,750
- You understand me.
- Of course.

1108
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:21,700
- It's alright. isn't it?
- Yes.

1109
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:24,950
Then why do you deliberately
interfere in this matter?

1110
01:27:25,890 --> 01:27:28,450
I always interfere intentionally.

1111
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:31,560
For me, breaking this web
is a game.

1112
01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:40,040
This girl is very weird.

1113
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:42,256
She's gone out with
Ashok again, today.

1114
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,706
Mummy, if Dilip comes to know...

1115
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:47,086
all our plans will be ruined.

1116
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:50,450
- Why don't you make her understand?
- What do I do?

1117
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:54,230
Baby, go sit with Dilip...

1118
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:57,510
in an intimate manner,
so we can click some photos.

1119
01:27:57,670 --> 01:28:00,256
But I have to go out
with Ashok now.

1120
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:03,146
Oh, my dear, forget Ashok;
go out with Randhir instead.

1121
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:05,816
But Baby, If we are
to ensnare Dilip...

1122
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,230
- it's very necessary to have photos of the two of you.
- Alright.

1123
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:16,370
Director saab, this is the perfect
'Laila-Majnu' pose.

1124
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:20,240
- Eh? Laila-Majnu? Go, take a photo, quickly!
- Yes, sir.

1125
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:23,380
- Slowly... silently...
- No, quickly!

1126
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,010
Just check, bhabhi. ls there
a letter from bhaiyya?

1127
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:41,720
What's the matter, bhabhi?
Let me see.

1128
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:46,470
From Dilip's letter,
I learned...

1129
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:48,870
that he couldn't come to Delhi
because of your ill-health.

1130
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:55,380
'Nirmal'. What does this prove?

1131
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:58,370
- That, once again, he has deceived us.
- No.

1132
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:01,580
- Just that bhaiyya didn't go to Delhi.
- It's the same thing.

1133
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,500
If he didn't wish
to deceive us...

1134
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:05,130
he could have returned home.

1135
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:10,640
- Why are you laughing?
- Bhabhi...

1136
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:13,260
You love him too.

1137
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:17,790
What's the value of that love if
you don't try to understand him?

1138
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:21,970
Of what use is such love that cannot
lend a helping hand?

1139
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:24,390
If Dilip bhaiyya has faltered...

1140
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:26,410
then, will you push him away?

1141
01:29:26,890 --> 01:29:30,220
Wouldn't you hold him closer instead,
so he can make amends?

1142
01:29:32,630 --> 01:29:35,240
Bhabhi, love is that which...

1143
01:29:35,630 --> 01:29:37,370
teaches us to sacrifice.

1144
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,150
Yes, indeed. Yes...

1145
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:53,470
I've investigated the matter
you told me about.

1146
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:55,660
That's fine.

1147
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:59,120
But... where is he?

1148
01:29:59,510 --> 01:30:01,410
Forgive me, but
I will not tell you that.

1149
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:04,250
- But, why?
- Accept that it's my pleasure.

1150
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,200
Why did you give me
this information?

1151
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:09,740
- That, too, is my pleasure.
- Who are you?

1152
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:13,200
You don't need to know that.

1153
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,570
But, listen... Oh...

1154
01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:22,810
What's the matter, nanaji?

1155
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:32,020
I sense a storm
about to break, Rajju.

1156
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:36,310
Dilip didn't go to Delhi.

1157
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:46,000
Would you please buckle this
for me? I can't do it.

1158
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:56,090
- Will you go to Juhu with Ashok today? Again?
- Yes.

1159
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:17,800
How do I look?

1160
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,760
Why do you go to Juhu
with Ashok every night?

1161
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,420
Because Ashok is not free
during the day.

1162
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:30,500
"He came into my courtyard..."

1163
01:31:30,950 --> 01:31:32,350
- I...
- Shut up!

1164
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:36,810
- What do you mean?
- You're not going anywhere with Ashok.

1165
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:40,300
Why? Is that an order?

1166
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:43,676
- Yes, it is.
- Then, I'll certainly go.

1167
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:47,070
- Why?
- Why? Do you really want to know?

1168
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:49,950
- Because I want to.
- Nayan...

1169
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:53,660
- And because, I am in love with Ashok Kumar.
- Nayan!

1170
01:31:54,650 --> 01:31:58,410
Don't shout! Behave like a respectable
person and speak politely.

1171
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:07,040
So, does that mean you were
deceiving me all along?

1172
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:10,720
- Bravo!
- Was this all an act?

1173
01:32:11,470 --> 01:32:14,240
Hey, you're becoming smarter
by the minute.

1174
01:32:15,650 --> 01:32:18,930
Listen. I love neither you...

1175
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:20,930
nor your family.

1176
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:25,010
Yes, I do like your wealth...

1177
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:28,870
and I can take advantage
of your family's prestige.

1178
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:33,430
Oh, you've arrived. How long
have I been waiting for you!

1179
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,700
Namaste, Mr. Dilip.

1180
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,600
Mr. Ashok Kumar!

1181
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,160
Let's go, Ashok Kumar.
Bye, darling.

1182
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:56,630
Nayan! I'll go home
right away.

1183
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:58,910
Go. If you have the guts.

1184
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:29,176
Why, my dear, you look
very disturbed.

1185
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,270
Please have someone pack
my luggage. I'm going home.

1186
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:35,660
What will you tell your dadaji
when you reach home?

1187
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:38,090
I'll tell him I was in hell.

1188
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:41,150
Call it hell, or heaven...

1189
01:33:41,670 --> 01:33:43,650
but don't forget this place.

1190
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,240
- After all, this is your in-laws' home.
- In-laws?

1191
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:50,520
Oh, how naīve you are!

1192
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:52,640
I could die for you!

1193
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:56,690
Now, please speak to dadaji...

1194
01:33:57,110 --> 01:33:59,810
about fixing a date for your
wedding to Nayantara.

1195
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:03,390
- Marry Nayantara? Me?
- Yes, of course. You.

1196
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:06,540
Who else will marry
my daughter now?

1197
01:34:06,690 --> 01:34:09,216
You have been staying here
these past five days.

1198
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:11,840
- We're respectable, too.
- Respectable?

1199
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:14,800
You folk? Ha!

1200
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:16,980
Well said!

1201
01:34:20,830 --> 01:34:21,930
Respectable!

1202
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:26,410
Don't brush my words lightly aside.

1203
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:28,740
Quickly fix a date for the wedding...

1204
01:34:29,010 --> 01:34:33,880
or I won't rest until I drag both
your grandfather and you to court.

1205
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:36,440
We are, both of us,
respectable people.

1206
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:39,150
When this is presented
in court...

1207
01:34:40,410 --> 01:34:42,360
when lawyers begin
to cross-question...

1208
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:45,320
when these are published
in the newspapers...

1209
01:34:45,650 --> 01:34:50,870
the caption will read, "The exploits
of the scion of an aristocratic family".

1210
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:56,556
And that's why, my dear,
I say that...

1211
01:34:56,580 --> 01:34:58,566
this wedding will
surely take place.

1212
01:34:58,590 --> 01:35:01,730
Whether you love Nayantara,
or not.

1213
01:35:02,350 --> 01:35:10,350
Why do my eyes fill with tears?

1214
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:19,750
Why did I remember
someone again?

1215
01:35:42,090 --> 01:35:50,090
I could not forget you,
but you so easily forgot

1216
01:35:58,980 --> 01:36:06,980
Weeping, my heart wonders why,
having embraced it, you forgot

1217
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:12,040
When I could not forget you

1218
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:26,710
Oh unfaithful one,
what have you done?

1219
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:35,210
You stole my heart,
and left me grief

1220
01:36:35,610 --> 01:36:39,616
I'd smiled a little while...

1221
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:43,740
but now, my beloved,
I weep all the while

1222
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:53,900
Why, oh moon, did you appear, only
to disappear in the blink of an eye?

1223
01:36:54,410 --> 01:37:02,410
I could not forget you,
but you so easily forgot

1224
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:24,106
At what inauspicious moment...

1225
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:28,740
did my gaze meet yours?

1226
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:45,100
When my heart, full of happiness,
had swayed in abandon

1227
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:55,920
Those golden days
and silver bright nights

1228
01:37:56,430 --> 01:38:00,240
When, meeting you, I was enthralled

1229
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:08,760
When I awoke, I realized
what I saw was but a dream

1230
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:19,240
You left me bereft
in that world of dreams

1231
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:27,860
I could not forget you,
but you so easily forgot

1232
01:38:47,610 --> 01:38:49,630
- Dadaji?
- Uh?

1233
01:38:51,070 --> 01:38:52,710
Oh... it's you.

1234
01:38:58,070 --> 01:39:01,080
You haven't gone
home yet, my dear?

1235
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:06,200
I was just leaving. You haven't
gone to bed yet.

1236
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:15,660
I couldn't sleep, my dear.

1237
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,520
Do you know whose photo this is?

1238
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:32,980
My daughter-in-law
passed away after...

1239
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:38,860
handing over the responsibility of
this three-year-old child to me.

1240
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:44,460
Today, Dilip is a young man.

1241
01:39:46,290 --> 01:39:49,660
But this old man has
grown tired along the way.

1242
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:55,230
Now, I want to hand over
my responsibility to hands...

1243
01:39:56,120 --> 01:40:00,830
that are both gentle
and strong, like yours.

1244
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:08,780
Dadaji, you're being
greatly deceived.

1245
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:13,010
I know everything, my dear.

1246
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:17,580
I raised Dilip within
my loving embrace.

1247
01:40:18,370 --> 01:40:21,430
But today, he's trapped
in his own deceit.

1248
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:28,020
But what if I don't consider myself
worthy of this responsiblity?

1249
01:40:28,330 --> 01:40:31,080
I'm not inexperienced in the
ways of the world, my dear.

1250
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:34,160
I can sift the wheat
from the chaff.

1251
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:36,140
I know well enough...

1252
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:39,610
who is worthy, and who is not.

1253
01:40:47,590 --> 01:40:48,790
My dear...

1254
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:53,780
today, I'm compelled to beg
a favor of you.

1255
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:58,020
You won't disappoint me, will you?

1256
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:03,390
Dadaji, I am but a poor girl.

1257
01:41:04,670 --> 01:41:06,230
You may be poor...

1258
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:10,680
but your heart is not, my dear.

1259
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:17,820
That's why I wanted to entrust you
with my family's honor.

1260
01:41:36,770 --> 01:41:39,330
I sense a storm coming.

1261
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:43,470
Who will save my family
from this storm?

1262
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:45,570
What storm, dadaji?

1263
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:51,570
You will understand when
the time comes, my dear.

1264
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:56,060
But, right now, I only want you
to promise me...

1265
01:41:56,590 --> 01:42:00,870
that when the storm breaks,
and the lamp in this house flickers...

1266
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:05,000
you will save it from being
extinguished. Promise me!

1267
01:42:05,730 --> 01:42:08,960
- Tell me, my dear, you will, won't you?
- Dadaji!

1268
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:26,630
Oh, you are here! I was
looking for you. Truly!

1269
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:35,496
Remember the woollens you packed
for me at the last minute?

1270
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,050
They saved my life in Delhi. Or,
I would have died of the cold!

1271
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:47,800
Are you annoyed with me?

1272
01:42:48,490 --> 01:42:51,940
I committed a grave error
while leaving. But, believe me...

1273
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:53,700
it still bothers me.

1274
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:56,930
Please forgive me.

1275
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:05,380
Why do you look so pensive?
Did you fall ill?

1276
01:43:05,410 --> 01:43:07,566
Not at all, I'm just tired
from the journey...

1277
01:43:07,590 --> 01:43:09,530
- the commotion of the wedding...
- Yes.

1278
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:16,210
- This letter from Delhi arrived today.
- From Delhi?

1279
01:43:21,810 --> 01:43:24,610
- Did dadaji see this letter?
- Of course not.

1280
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:29,890
But, for how long will you continue
to deceive your old dadaji?

1281
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:35,330
Kiran... Kiran Devi!

1282
01:43:36,630 --> 01:43:39,290
Rajju, please call Kiran back.

1283
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:43,266
She left here, annoyed with me.
I want to tell her everything.

1284
01:43:43,290 --> 01:43:46,050
Why are you so anxious?
So what if Kiran left, annoyed?

1285
01:43:46,340 --> 01:43:50,146
- Who is she to you that her annoyance troubles you so?
- Rajju!

1286
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:51,370
I'm listening.

1287
01:43:57,270 --> 01:44:01,460
You won't understand, Rajju.
No one tries to understand me.

1288
01:44:02,970 --> 01:44:04,340
The world assumes...

1289
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:07,290
that a man is as bright
and clear as day, or...

1290
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:09,320
as dark as night.

1291
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:12,270
But, between day and night,
there's also dusk.

1292
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:15,916
Dawn comes in between, too...
when dark meets light.

1293
01:44:15,940 --> 01:44:19,160
True... But, what
are you implying?

1294
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:21,850
You know. Yet, you ask?

1295
01:44:23,370 --> 01:44:25,296
I know, Rajju, that I'm weak...

1296
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:27,050
a liar, unworthy.

1297
01:44:28,290 --> 01:44:30,650
Those who are worthy, the world
is theirs for the asking.

1298
01:44:31,570 --> 01:44:33,280
But those who are weak
and unworthy...

1299
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:35,550
it's for them that God
has created affection.

1300
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:40,130
Rajju, I love Kiran.

1301
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:45,670
I want the support of her love,
her gentle, yet strong hands.

1302
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:50,130
But if, due to my frailties,
I do not get that...

1303
01:44:50,230 --> 01:44:52,010
will I be deprived of
her affection too?

1304
01:44:52,660 --> 01:44:56,320
I can't bear her hatred, Rajju.
It eats me up inside.

1305
01:45:26,590 --> 01:45:29,230
What are you doing?
Play louder.

1306
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:32,540
Louder! Louder still...

1307
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:34,946
- Louder!
- There aren't any notes higher than this, sir.

1308
01:45:34,970 --> 01:45:37,690
- Eh? - There's no note higher than this.
- What's up, Matadeen?

1309
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:39,940
- Sir!
- What's all this?

1310
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,300
- The wedding, sir.
- Wedding? - Yes.

1311
01:45:42,450 --> 01:45:44,730
- Whose wedding?
- The young master's.

1312
01:45:44,830 --> 01:45:48,596
The young master's wedding?
Who told you that?

1313
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:52,130
Does everything need to be
spelled out for old retainers, sir?

1314
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:56,050
That means everything
is kept in readiness.

1315
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:58,326
As it was when I was dying?

1316
01:45:58,350 --> 01:46:02,430
- Yes, indeed, sir. Everything.
- Excellent!

1317
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:06,866
Here is the guest list.
Send them the invitations.

1318
01:46:06,890 --> 01:46:09,710
- These have already been sent, sir.
- Already sent?

1319
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:11,500
Sent already.

1320
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:17,740
Why, my dear,
what has Dilip written?

1321
01:46:20,430 --> 01:46:24,350
- Here, you read it.
- Alright. I'll read it myself.

1322
01:46:30,130 --> 01:46:32,670
"I want to meet you in private.

1323
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:35,070
Please don't refuse."

1324
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:38,940
Hey, he still refers to you
by an honorific?

1325
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:41,930
Why wouldn't he? I'm
his teacher, am I not?

1326
01:46:42,490 --> 01:46:44,920
Madam Teacher, I've a simple request.

1327
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:47,760
- Of course, tell me.
- When you meet him today...

1328
01:46:47,930 --> 01:46:51,530
meet him not as his teacher,
but as a young woman. Okay?

1329
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:53,520
As you wish, my lord!

1330
01:46:57,730 --> 01:47:00,750
- Sis, will you concede my request?
- What's it?

1331
01:47:01,290 --> 01:47:04,250
- First, promise you will agree.
- I promise.

1332
01:47:04,870 --> 01:47:06,470
Don't say anything to Dilip today.

1333
01:47:06,830 --> 01:47:09,020
No matter what he says,
or how wrong it is.

1334
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:10,870
You won't say anything.

1335
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:15,200
Look... today, there will be
no 'No'. Only 'Yes'...

1336
01:47:15,970 --> 01:47:17,420
Okay, my dear, okay!

1337
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:20,450
It all seems like a dream...

1338
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:23,000
Doesn't it?

1339
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:26,450
Yes.

1340
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:32,330
Shall I go?

1341
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:58,160
You've arrived. Please, come.

1342
01:48:11,630 --> 01:48:13,990
- May I say something?
- Please.

1343
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:18,190
Henceforth, please don't use
the formal 'aap' [ 'you'].

1344
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:21,160
- Use the more casual 'tum' ['You']
- 'Tum'?

1345
01:48:23,950 --> 01:48:26,070
- Kiran Devi...
- Not 'devi' [goddess]

1346
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:28,310
Just an ordinary girl.

1347
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:31,940
Like the many hundreds of
ordinary girls in this world.

1348
01:48:34,350 --> 01:48:37,810
But each of these ordinary girls is
special to someone or the other.

1349
01:48:40,030 --> 01:48:41,130
Come.

1350
01:48:46,630 --> 01:48:48,970
- Have you been waiting long?
- Yes.

1351
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:51,230
Sit.

1352
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:05,560
What are you thinking?

1353
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:10,970
I'm thinking it all seems
like a dream.

1354
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:15,360
- An acquaintance of a few days...
- Today is the 16th day.

1355
01:49:20,510 --> 01:49:22,580
A lot has happened
in these 16 days.

1356
01:49:23,630 --> 01:49:25,190
Everything seems fresh and new.

1357
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:28,280
I began to look at myself
differently too.

1358
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:35,720
Will you tell me
something, truthfully?

1359
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:39,420
How did you agree to marry me?

1360
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:44,060
Because you took pity on me?
Out of compassion?

1361
01:49:44,190 --> 01:49:46,880
Chhi! Don't say that.

1362
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:49,080
It hurts me.

1363
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:53,500
What do you lack?

1364
01:49:58,440 --> 01:49:59,540
Then?

1365
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:06,710
How can I say?

1366
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:11,460
Won't you understand?

1367
01:50:15,690 --> 01:50:19,230
- What happened?
- I deceived you, Kiran.

1368
01:50:20,430 --> 01:50:24,010
I've been deceiving you
until this day, this moment.

1369
01:50:25,610 --> 01:50:27,560
Such horrible deceit!

1370
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:29,950
Listen.

1371
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:33,050
Raise your head.

1372
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:37,080
Look at me.

1373
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:41,490
You mean to speak about
Nayantara, don't you?

1374
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:43,520
I know all about her.

1375
01:50:44,390 --> 01:50:46,340
But what's there to be
embarrassed about?

1376
01:50:47,710 --> 01:50:51,840
- You're not God. You're human.
- Kiran...

1377
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:55,780
Rajjo told me everything.

1378
01:50:57,610 --> 01:51:00,030
That's why I feel
so close to you.

1379
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:02,850
Do you love me so much?

1380
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:06,540
Why else would I be so happy?

1381
01:51:07,970 --> 01:51:10,330
So happy, I cannot bear it.

1382
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:31,520
The person I hate the most
in this world today...

1383
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:33,850
I'll have to accept her forever.

1384
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:36,710
They have taken full
advantage of my weaknesses.

1385
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:39,630
I have to marry Nayantara.

1386
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:42,930
Or she will drag
dadaji to court.

1387
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:46,670
Dadaji will never be able to
withstand the stigma.

1388
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:55,410
Sixteen days ago, I may have been
able to endure this hatred.

1389
01:51:56,390 --> 01:52:00,690
But today, now, when the doors
of heaven have opened for me...

1390
01:52:07,660 --> 01:52:09,260
I won't ask for your
forgiveness...

1391
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:13,030
for I am not even worthy
of your hatred.

1392
01:52:17,110 --> 01:52:18,960
But I beg a small favor.

1393
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:24,320
- Tell me.
- Tomorrow, when dadaji sends the car for you...

1394
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:28,350
send him a note saying
you don't wish to marry me.

1395
01:52:29,850 --> 01:52:32,580
There's no other way
to persuade dadaji.

1396
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:36,100
I'll write.

1397
01:52:39,260 --> 01:52:40,460
Kiran Devi!

1398
01:52:43,150 --> 01:52:46,170
Please leave me alone
for a while...

1399
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:48,260
for a while.

1400
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:22,360
Hello... Who's this?

1401
01:53:23,190 --> 01:53:26,440
It's I. Mummy. Tell me, Dilip,
what have you decided?

1402
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:28,760
Come home with Nayantara
tomorrow evening.

1403
01:53:29,670 --> 01:53:31,320
You're very nice, Dilip.

1404
01:53:32,770 --> 01:53:35,490
Tomorrow is a special day!
Tomorrow...

1405
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:39,280
Tomorrow!

1406
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:44,800
Tomorrow... tomorrow...
tomorrow...

1407
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:15,940
The city of hopes...

1408
01:54:16,210 --> 01:54:21,060
lies wasted

1409
01:54:22,170 --> 01:54:28,700
By my own fate...

1410
01:54:29,380 --> 01:54:32,530
am I deceived

1411
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:40,910
He came as a ray of hope...

1412
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:50,220
but left me in tears

1413
01:55:01,430 --> 01:55:06,750
Breaking my heart...

1414
01:55:06,910 --> 01:55:11,890
where did he go,
oh where did he go?

1415
01:55:22,070 --> 01:55:27,230
Turning his face away from me...

1416
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:32,410
where did he go,
oh where did he go?

1417
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:57,740
We couldn't spent any time together

1418
01:55:57,870 --> 01:56:02,850
I couldn't find the words
to express my feelings

1419
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:17,860
Breaking all ties with me...

1420
01:56:22,910 --> 01:56:27,986
where did he go,
oh where did he go?

1421
01:56:28,010 --> 01:56:32,740
Breaking my heart...

1422
01:56:32,770 --> 01:56:37,640
where did he go,
oh where did he go?

1423
01:56:52,670 --> 01:56:57,110
The shore recedes from my ship

1424
01:56:57,450 --> 01:57:04,850
The stars of my Fate
have sunk...

1425
01:57:14,750 --> 01:57:19,690
leaving me alone and bereft

1426
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:29,526
Where did he go,
oh where did he go?

1427
01:57:29,550 --> 01:57:34,330
Breaking my heart...

1428
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:39,510
where did he go,
oh where did he go?

1429
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:04,600
What happened, Kiran?
Why are you sitting like this?

1430
01:58:05,990 --> 01:58:08,200
I did exactly as
you said, Malti.

1431
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:12,650
I didn't say anything to him
today. Nothing at all.

1432
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:14,510
But, what's the matter?

1433
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:19,100
Dilip said that he
cannot marry me.

1434
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:22,510
He'd asked to meet
so he could tell me.

1435
01:58:25,530 --> 01:58:26,830
Don't cry, Malti.

1436
01:58:28,290 --> 01:58:30,600
Even when absence leaves
your heart forlorn...

1437
01:58:31,990 --> 01:58:35,310
you still hear the aching melody
of the flute.

1438
01:58:37,410 --> 01:58:40,020
But when your heart is rendered
desolate by separation...

1439
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:44,990
the silence is so deep,
you hear nothing.

1440
01:58:47,070 --> 01:58:48,340
A quiet...

1441
01:58:49,030 --> 01:58:50,130
intense...

1442
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:53,470
never-ending silence.

1443
01:58:55,790 --> 01:58:59,090
Even the notes that herald Spring
seem out of tune.

1444
01:59:02,830 --> 01:59:04,030
Don't cry.

1445
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:12,246
Hey, Dilip, come here, my dear.

1446
01:59:12,270 --> 01:59:15,470
Diwan saab has been waiting for
so long. Come on, come, come.

1447
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:18,850
Come, meet Motilalji.

1448
01:59:26,110 --> 01:59:28,490
- Namaste, Dilip. - Namaste.
- Sir...

1449
01:59:28,730 --> 01:59:30,890
Miss Nayantara and
her mother have arrived.

1450
01:59:31,230 --> 01:59:33,240
- Make them comfortable in my room.
- Not at all.

1451
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:35,540
[Mumbled conversation in the background.]

1452
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:39,580
Arre, Momin! Matadeen!

1453
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:41,340
Matadeen!

1454
01:59:59,350 --> 02:00:00,576
- Doctor!
- Yes?

1455
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:03,776
- Bahurani hasn't...
- Rai saheb, you're worrying unnecessarily.

1456
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:05,610
- But, dadaji...
- Yes?

1457
02:00:12,510 --> 02:00:13,710
What's it?

1458
02:00:26,020 --> 02:00:27,220
Come upstairs.

1459
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:47,040
- What does this mean?
- Er...

1460
02:00:47,900 --> 02:00:50,510
- Who brought this letter?
- The driver.

1461
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:56,180
Dilip, look at me.

1462
02:00:58,020 --> 02:01:00,260
Meet my gaze and
tell me, truthfully...

1463
02:01:00,850 --> 02:01:02,950
- what's the matter?
- Dadaji...

1464
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:06,240
- I am forced to marry Nayantara now.
- Hmm.

1465
02:01:08,070 --> 02:01:09,990
I knew, right from
the start, that...

1466
02:01:10,430 --> 02:01:13,290
you only wanted to
marry Nayantara.

1467
02:01:13,970 --> 02:01:16,470
You wish to ruin
my family, my honor...

1468
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:19,100
the fine reputation of
my ancestors...

1469
02:01:19,540 --> 02:01:21,980
by your shamelessness.

1470
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:25,520
So that I'm laughed at,
everywhere...

1471
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:30,086
and people can mock me
and spit upon my name.

1472
02:01:30,110 --> 02:01:31,600
- No, no, dadaji...
- No?

1473
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:34,940
Then, why do you want to marry
that shameless woman...

1474
02:01:35,350 --> 02:01:37,370
who dances in public...

1475
02:01:37,510 --> 02:01:39,090
who has no idea...

1476
02:01:39,310 --> 02:01:42,660
what constitutes a home
or a family...

1477
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:45,446
how to take care of a husband...

1478
02:01:45,470 --> 02:01:47,940
or respect elders.

1479
02:01:48,290 --> 02:01:50,566
And you wish to bring that
woman into this house...

1480
02:01:50,590 --> 02:01:52,870
and make her the lady
of the manor?

1481
02:01:53,090 --> 02:01:55,280
No! This cannot happen!

1482
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:58,240
- I'll not allow this as long as I live.
- Dadaji!

1483
02:02:02,510 --> 02:02:05,890
Dilip, come here.

1484
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:16,140
Look at this.

1485
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:19,350
You were just
a little child when...

1486
02:02:20,420 --> 02:02:22,790
I took over your upbringing.

1487
02:02:23,850 --> 02:02:25,150
Made you worthy...

1488
02:02:25,830 --> 02:02:28,230
of being this family's torch-bearer.

1489
02:02:29,380 --> 02:02:31,790
In return, today, you wish that...

1490
02:02:32,220 --> 02:02:34,540
I should go and tell people...

1491
02:02:35,030 --> 02:02:37,400
that the woman who will be
the mistress of this house...

1492
02:02:37,710 --> 02:02:41,190
is a woman who sells herself,
a common dancer?

1493
02:02:50,690 --> 02:02:52,360
You could say, dadaji...

1494
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:55,716
that Dilip is disreputable
and you disinherited him.

1495
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:57,240
This, too, is my failure.

1496
02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:59,650
A falure of my love, my blood...

1497
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:01,430
of my lineage.

1498
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:05,030
That such a dishonorable child
was born in this family.

1499
02:03:05,300 --> 02:03:08,110
A son who stained
the family's honor...

1500
02:03:08,450 --> 02:03:11,320
and deceived his dying grandfather...

1501
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:13,960
until his last breath.

1502
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:15,930
I didn't deceive you, dadaji.

1503
02:03:16,340 --> 02:03:17,670
I've been deceived.

1504
02:03:18,390 --> 02:03:20,170
If I don't marry Nayantara...

1505
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:22,900
then, the greedy mother
and daughter, both...

1506
02:03:23,260 --> 02:03:26,930
- will drag us both to court.
- I'm willing to appear in court.

1507
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:30,870
I'm ready to spend
every last penny I possess.

1508
02:03:31,140 --> 02:03:35,400
- But I'm not willing to see that woman in this house!
- Dadaji!

1509
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:44,320
Dilip! Tell me the truth.

1510
02:03:45,490 --> 02:03:47,770
Are you still in love
with Nayantara?

1511
02:03:49,660 --> 02:03:51,840
I was, dadaji, but now, I'm not.

1512
02:03:52,970 --> 02:03:57,210
Believe me, now
I hate her. Hate her!

1513
02:03:57,420 --> 02:04:00,090
Alright. Are they here now?

1514
02:04:01,020 --> 02:04:03,620
- Yes.
- Bring them to the museum.

1515
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:07,290
- I wish to talk to them directly.
- Yes.

1516
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:14,000
Dadaji! What are you doing?

1517
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:16,680
Do as you're told.

1518
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:20,870
I'll handle everything.

1519
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:07,980
Do write when you reach Poona.

1520
02:05:14,060 --> 02:05:15,260
Let's go.

1521
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:33,176
Excuse me... I've come from the
Rai Bahadur's house.

1522
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:35,556
- Where is Kiran Devi?
- She just left.

1523
02:05:35,580 --> 02:05:37,140
Left? Come, driver.

1524
02:05:41,630 --> 02:05:42,730
Quiet!

1525
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:45,880
Do you wish to marry Dilip?

1526
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:49,560
- Or his wealth and prestige?
- His wealth and prestige.

1527
02:05:50,420 --> 02:05:53,190
But one can't marry
wealth and prestige.

1528
02:05:53,590 --> 02:05:56,160
- So, unfortunately, I have to marry Dilip.
- Hmm?

1529
02:06:12,380 --> 02:06:15,670
Here's a check for Rs.50,000.
And there's the door.

1530
02:06:17,110 --> 02:06:19,640
But this is wealth,
Rai Bahadur saaheb.

1531
02:06:20,780 --> 02:06:22,630
You forget that I...

1532
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:26,290
- need respect as well.
- Respect? And you?

1533
02:06:26,990 --> 02:06:30,520
Of course. When my daughter
enters this house.

1534
02:06:30,690 --> 02:06:33,600
Your daughter will force
her way into this house?

1535
02:06:33,810 --> 02:06:36,870
Into this house, which can trace
its heritage back 500 years?

1536
02:06:37,230 --> 02:06:40,180
Not every antique is valuable,
Rai Bahadur saheb.

1537
02:06:40,610 --> 02:06:44,220
Quiet! You have no right
to mock our lineage.

1538
02:06:45,020 --> 02:06:46,530
We have no right...

1539
02:06:46,870 --> 02:06:50,200
but your grandson has the right
to do as he pleases.

1540
02:06:50,770 --> 02:06:53,116
What would you call that nobility,
Rai Bahadur saheb?

1541
02:06:53,140 --> 02:06:55,870
When he plays fast and loose
with every girl in town...

1542
02:06:55,970 --> 02:06:59,096
makes love to them, and
promises them marriage...

1543
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:01,476
and cleverly extricates himself
at the right moment?

1544
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:04,580
That is a lie! Dilip
did not deceive you...

1545
02:07:04,910 --> 02:07:07,780
- It's you folk who are deceiving him.
- Of course.

1546
02:07:08,060 --> 02:07:12,250
Deceit is like a counterfeit coin.
Everyone tries to pass it on.

1547
02:07:12,380 --> 02:07:15,890
Someone deceived us.
We are defrauding you.

1548
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:19,750
But, what if I don't accept
this counterfeit coin?

1549
02:07:20,690 --> 02:07:23,800
Who does willingly accept
counterfeit coins?

1550
02:07:23,850 --> 02:07:27,030
It just lands up. Like we
landed up in your house.

1551
02:07:27,150 --> 02:07:29,170
"Like you landed up
in our house!"

1552
02:07:29,630 --> 02:07:31,270
What do you think I am?

1553
02:07:31,540 --> 02:07:34,420
You think I will fall
into your trap?

1554
02:07:34,570 --> 02:07:37,080
And hand his family's honor
over to you?

1555
02:07:40,370 --> 02:07:43,090
You want wealth and respect!

1556
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:45,610
Respect? Or wealth?

1557
02:07:46,170 --> 02:07:48,690
You will get neither!

1558
02:07:48,790 --> 02:07:52,510
You will die a dog's death!
Right here. Right now.

1559
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:55,550
You will remember
who you messed with.

1560
02:08:03,330 --> 02:08:07,040
- Please sit, dadaji.
- Yes, please be seated. Please...

1561
02:08:07,460 --> 02:08:09,940
I'll explain everything in detail.

1562
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:13,830
The fact is, Rai Bahadur, this can't
be resolved by guns and bullets.

1563
02:08:14,650 --> 02:08:18,200
Listen. Your grandson,
Mr. Dilip Kumar...

1564
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:21,706
is in love with our Baby.

1565
02:08:21,730 --> 02:08:24,960
- Love? - Yes, love.
- No, Dadaji.

1566
02:08:25,170 --> 02:08:28,760
And the proof lies in these
letters, written by him.

1567
02:08:33,810 --> 02:08:36,720
Oh, you tore the letters.
So what, Rai Bahadur?

1568
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,210
We have...

1569
02:08:39,470 --> 02:08:41,710
photographs of the two of them.

1570
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:50,670
- Dadaji...
- You tore the photos as well? Rai Bahadur...

1571
02:08:50,820 --> 02:08:53,720
You behave like a child even though
you're quite old.

1572
02:08:54,130 --> 02:08:56,950
You tore the letter, so you think
the matter is closed.

1573
02:08:57,660 --> 02:08:59,330
You destroyed the photo, so...

1574
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:02,450
you assume that Baby's and Dilip's
wedding cannot take place.

1575
02:09:03,020 --> 02:09:05,840
Dear sir, we have photocopies
of these letters...

1576
02:09:05,890 --> 02:09:09,230
and the negatives of these
photographs safe and secure.

1577
02:09:09,420 --> 02:09:12,230
They can be produced in court
when necessary.

1578
02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:15,070
- Director!
- Ah, Rai Bahadur, after this...

1579
02:09:15,370 --> 02:09:18,620
you will be a household name. Every
newspaper will have your photo...

1580
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:20,350
every lane will whisper about...

1581
02:09:20,510 --> 02:09:23,780
the Rai Bahadur's grandson, Dilip's
love affair with a dancer.

1582
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:37,110
Bravo! Well-done!

1583
02:09:40,790 --> 02:09:43,650
- You?
- Yes. You left me alone over there.

1584
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:47,420
But I can see that all the
entertainment is happening here.

1585
02:09:49,980 --> 02:09:53,110
Mr. Ashok Kumar, dadaji's
condition is serious.

1586
02:09:55,450 --> 02:09:58,260
Rai Bahadur saheb, here are
the photocopies of the letters...

1587
02:09:58,300 --> 02:10:00,420
and the negatives of the photos.

1588
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:03,650
- Just keep them safe.
- But, you...

1589
02:10:03,730 --> 02:10:06,640
- You don't need to know anything else.
- Ashok!

1590
02:10:08,590 --> 02:10:11,720
- I really regret this, Nayan. I...
- Brute!

1591
02:10:13,410 --> 02:10:16,960
Please forgive me, Mummy.
I have a tiny flaw...

1592
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:19,590
I can't bear to see a decent man
being destroyed like this.

1593
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:24,530
So, Director... how did you like
the twist in the climax?

1594
02:10:38,070 --> 02:10:40,580
Beware, Dilip!
If you move, I'll shoot.

1595
02:10:40,940 --> 02:10:43,170
Dilip, be warned.
If you come closer...

1596
02:10:43,410 --> 02:10:45,580
I'll shoot! Dilip!

1597
02:10:46,990 --> 02:10:51,536
I'll shoot! Dilip...
I tell you, I'll shoot!

1598
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:53,970
Don't come any closer, Dilip...
Dilip!

1599
02:11:02,250 --> 02:11:03,990
Oh, mummy!

1600
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:17,630
Keep this safe, Rai Bahadur saheb.
I think this is yours.

1601
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:21,200
What have you done, Ashok!

1602
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:24,220
I have drained your venom,
my dear snake.

1603
02:11:24,850 --> 02:11:27,970
Don't be afraid. Poison cannot
harm other poisons.

1604
02:11:28,490 --> 02:11:31,770
Come. Director saab,
you come, too.

1605
02:11:31,900 --> 02:11:34,500
It can be dangerous to remain here
after the climax. Yes?

1606
02:11:35,220 --> 02:11:37,600
Stay, Ashok Kumar saab.
Let me call for a doctor.

1607
02:11:38,120 --> 02:11:39,916
Don't worry, friend.
The doctor is right here.

1608
02:11:39,940 --> 02:11:45,260
- The wound is very deep.
- "I continue to be faithful to the thorns as well"

1609
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:48,380
Come.

1610
02:11:58,460 --> 02:12:00,260
- Dadaji!
- You!

1611
02:12:00,740 --> 02:12:03,570
- Dadaji...
- You have come, my dear.

1612
02:12:05,480 --> 02:12:07,640
You are the person
I need, right now.

1613
02:12:08,670 --> 02:12:11,840
Do you remember? Once, you...

1614
02:12:12,310 --> 02:12:13,910
had promised me...

1615
02:12:15,530 --> 02:12:20,510
that if the lamp of my home flickers
in an approaching storm...

1616
02:12:21,740 --> 02:12:23,140
you would save him?

1617
02:12:25,980 --> 02:12:28,520
Dilip, come here, my son.

1618
02:12:31,510 --> 02:12:33,670
This old man is very tired now.

1619
02:12:35,250 --> 02:12:36,490
My responsibility...

1620
02:12:38,420 --> 02:12:41,830
I'm handing over to you.
You take care of him, my dear.

1621
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:43,510
Take care of him.
