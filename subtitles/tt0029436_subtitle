3
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,020
I've told you once.
I've told you a million times.

4
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,570
You'll marry the boy I've chosen.

5
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,920
I'll give up my life.

6
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,230
But I won't marry anyone
who doesn't love me.

7
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,380
Love? You've been beguiled
by that boy Ramdas.

8
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,400
That's why this stubbornness.

9
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,580
Did we send you to college
to study or to fall in love?

10
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,460
It might be worth considering
if Ramdas had money.

11
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,670
He has the talent if not money.

12
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,200
He stood first in college.

13
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,390
So what use is talent?

14
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,950
These days, very well educated boys
struggle to make ends meet.

15
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,350
How will he provide for himself
and you if he doesn't have money?

16
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:51,450
This luxury you're so used to,
will Ramdas be able to provide it?

17
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,420
Priest.

18
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,280
Welcome.

19
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,000
Priest, you've come
at the right time.

20
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,390
Convince this stubborn girl.

21
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,760
We've arranged her marriage
with a boy from a wealthy family...

22
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,720
but she just doesn't agree.

23
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,490
I know.
I overheard your conversation.

24
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,340
But I don't want to prove
to be a hindrance to love.

25
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,610
Not so long ago,
I was also a social being.

26
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,260
A social animal at that.

27
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:54,670
All of a sudden, something happened
that made me give up this world.

28
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,060
I vowed to perform service
and got admitted to an ashram.

29
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,190
No one knows this.

30
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,420
Today I'm telling you.

31
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,050
This might help you
sort this issue out.

32
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,000
Far away from here. Very far away.

33
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,600
Across the river.

34
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,100
In the lap of mountains.

35
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,690
Our small little city was flourishing.

36
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:46,650
Two widows named Heera
and Shanti used to live there.

37
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,960
Heera had a boy. Jagat.

38
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,820
Shanti had a girl. Maya.

39
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,110
When Jagat and Maya grew up...

40
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,710
I am willing to marry my son
to Chandrakant's sister.

41
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,580
But I will take a hefty dowry.

42
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,200
Right, Shanti.

43
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,210
Priest, Jagat is done with his studies.

44
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,800
He wants to go to Bombay
for further studies.

45
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,750
For that, I need money.

46
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,090
That's why sister Heera
asks for a dowry.

47
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,450
Ms. Heera, don't you worry.

48
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,500
Mr. Chandrakant won't think
twice when it comes to his sister.

49
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,360
He has no other family,
and lots of wealth.

50
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,260
Why doesn't he get married?

51
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,820
He wants a damsel.

52
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,890
And where do I find one?

53
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,410
Have you seen Maya?

54
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,060
Maya who?

55
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,650
Sister Shanti's daughter.

56
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,980
Wait. I'll call her.

57
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,580
Maya. Maya.

58
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,080
You called me, aunt?

59
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,090
Yes. Come and seek
the priest's blessings.

60
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,260
God bless you, dear.

61
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,410
I saw her when she was this small.

62
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,940
Wow. She is no less than a Goddess.

63
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,540
Lady, do you have any
idea what's happening?

64
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,900
He's arranging your marriage to Jagat.

65
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,990
- Let go, aunt.
- Listen up.

66
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,440
Bulbul. My Bulbul.

67
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,760
Did you hear
what aunt just told me?

68
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,040
Lady, do you have any
idea what's happening?

69
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,800
The priest is arranging
your marriage to Jagat.

70
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,160
But Bulbul...

71
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,580
who told mother and
aunt that I loved him?

72
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,390
You must have told her.

73
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,520
No. You must have.

74
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,480
I haven't told this
to anyone except you.

75
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,100
You naughty bird.

76
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,510
Okay. I forgive you.

77
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,800
Okay. I'll go and fix both
marriages right away.

78
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,170
That would be so kind of you, sir.

79
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,750
With God's grace, I hope both
the marriages are finalized.

80
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,650
That'll be a huge
weight off my back.

81
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,330
Obviously. Maya will get married.

82
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,400
And Jagat's education
will be taken care of.

83
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,430
Bhagwan Das has written
that Jagat will stay...

84
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,310
at his house till the
completion of his studies.

85
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,390
But how can one live at
someone's house for so long?

86
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,690
There are more expenses to be borne.

87
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,510
College fees, books. This and that.

88
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,376
That's what I'm saying.

89
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,700
If we get money as dowry,
all our worries will be taken care of.

90
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,990
Look, God is great.

91
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,340
The priest has said so.

92
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,616
Mother, I've got
all the information...

93
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,040
about the college admission.

94
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,950
I must go to Bombay
as soon as possible.

95
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,310
Or the admissions will end.

96
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,590
Stay here for a few days.

97
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,150
Your marriage is being arranged.

98
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,930
Marriage? So early?

99
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,140
Let me finish my studies first.

100
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,940
So, is daughter-in-law going
to stop you from studying?

101
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,700
If you're lucky and find a
nice girl, she'll take you places.

102
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,610
And what if I get a bumpkin?

103
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,890
Then start teaching her
instead of studying yourself.

104
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,270
Right. Knowledge increases if
you teach and also when you study.

105
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,330
No. No. I don't want to get
tied down by this bond right now.

106
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,420
Will things happen
as you wish or as I wish?

107
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,150
So, who is she?

108
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,740
Who am I getting married to?

109
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,090
Wait.

110
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,660
Why not tell me right now?

111
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,780
How can we tell you
before the marriage?

112
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,200
How would you know who the
girl is even if I told you?

113
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,790
So silly of me.

114
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,270
Aunts aren't telling you the
name of the girl to tease you.

115
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,470
I'll tell you.

116
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,760
Usha, I pray that you
bring prosperity to my son.

117
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,566
I'll go through
the calendar and fix...

118
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,840
the dates for both the weddings.

119
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,040
Mr. Chandrakant wants to see Maya.

120
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,720
That's why fix the wedding date of...

121
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,110
Jagat and Usha'a wedding.

122
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,040
No. Let him see Maya first.

123
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,690
I want both the marriages
to happen together.

124
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,370
Fine.

125
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll come and see her.

126
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,870
Hello?

127
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:24,080
Sir, I can't praise
Maya's beauty enough.

128
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,800
I guarantee you won't find
another beautiful girl like her.

129
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,880
That's great.

130
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,720
Buddhu, get the bottle (of alcohol).

131
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,740
Send a message to Sonabai's place...

132
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,450
that I'll be coming there this
evening to listen to her song.

133
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,710
Mr. Chandrakant,
ours is a small city.

134
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,600
It doesn't take much
for the word to spread.

135
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,730
Stop all these things if
you want to get your sister...

136
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,060
married to Mrs. Heera's son.

137
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,080
He can marry my sister
only if he needs her badly.

138
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,220
There's one more thing.

139
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:11,530
If Shanti comes to know,
it's possible that...

140
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,610
she might reject this proposal.

141
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,800
So she should keep her
daughter with her.

142
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,920
You haven't seen her yet.

143
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,630
I've counted your petals.

144
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,860
I share my feelings with you.

145
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,730
Don't forget this.

146
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,766
Send this message to him.

147
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,970
- To whom?
- To whom I said.

148
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,360
Send the message.

149
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,350
I won't give you the message.

150
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,530
You're in bloom today,
but you'll wither tomorrow.

151
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,950
Give the message to the fragrance.

152
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,050
The flower might wither away,
but the fragrance will remain.

153
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,490
Till when? Tomorrow?

154
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,490
No. Forever.

155
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,400
First tell me, why do you not
obey your mother's wishes?

156
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:00,970
What?

157
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,240
Didn't she ask you to marry?

158
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,250
Oh. First of all, I don't know
to whom I'll be getting married.

159
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,580
I know.

160
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,340
Really. Tell me.

161
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,740
Tell me. Why don't you want to
marry before leaving for Bombay?

162
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,090
I want to fulfill the
objective of my life first.

163
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,230
What on earth is your objective?

164
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,570
You want to hear? Okay.

165
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,410
Sit.

166
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:38,690
I want to study hard. Pass the exam.

167
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,030
Make my life successful.

168
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,310
And then do something for my country.

169
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:19,726
Jagat Narayan has topped the exams.

170
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,220
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

171
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,340
- This calls for some sweets.
- Yes. Sure. Sure.

172
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:34,270
I congratulate the defense lawyer,
Mr. Jagat Narayan...

173
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,520
because you've helped the
court arrive at the right decision...

174
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,940
with your talent and
experience today as well.

175
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:01,426
Respected Mr. Jagat Narayan,
you've done your city...

176
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,940
a huge favor by
starting this college with...

177
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,280
your lifelong
earnings of Rs. 2,500,000.

178
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,220
Now, thanks to your kindness,
even the poorest child...

179
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,590
in the city will be
able to pursue the highest...

180
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,790
degree of the
university right here.

181
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,860
Why, Maya?

182
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,610
Didn't you like my dream?

183
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,650
- No.
- Why?

184
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,740
There's no place
for me in your dream.

185
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,580
Maya, you're not a dream.

186
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,360
You're reality.

187
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,430
Yes. That's why you don't
think about me even in your dreams.

188
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,890
And I dream and think only about you.

189
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,750
Really? Won't you tell me?

190
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,540
Here goes.

191
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,566
Okay, tell me.

192
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,000
Who makes better food?

193
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,190
- Mother or...
- Daughter-in-law.

194
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,330
Mother isn't here.

195
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,166
Daughter-in-law.

196
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,810
- Daughter-in-law makes it better.
- Yes, right. - Really.

197
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,150
So Mohan, who is better?

198
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,790
Mother or father?

199
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,520
Say it's mother.

200
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,800
Mother will get you a toy.

201
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,370
Son, I've found
a beautiful bride for you.

202
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,670
I am really fortunate.

203
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,960
I am dying a married woman.

204
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,110
I don't like your last dream.

205
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Why?

206
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,370
You'll go away. And leave me alone.

207
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,980
What about you going
to Bombay and leaving me?

208
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,010
But I'll be back after a few days.

209
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,980
Why don't you take me with you?

210
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
How?

211
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,310
Didn't your mother tell you to marry?

212
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,910
Yes. How is that connected
to your going to Bombay?

213
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,920
You just don't understand.

214
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,280
Maya. Really?

215
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,790
Why didn't mother tell me
she wants me to marry you?

216
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,700
I would never have refused.

217
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,320
Shanti, now what?

218
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,360
This spells doom.

219
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,960
We had no idea this would happen.

220
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,040
We must separate them
from each other immediately.

221
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,700
Certainly. But how?

222
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,080
Jagat wants to go to Bombay.
Let him go to Bombay.

223
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:48,190
Yes. And you somehow convince Maya...

224
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,400
and get her married to Chandrakant.

225
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,630
Then we'll call Jagat from Bombay...

226
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,220
- and get him married to Usha.
- Good idea.

227
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,850
You're here, Jagat.

228
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,450
I looked for you all over.

229
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,000
What are you doing here, Maya?

230
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,920
There are chores to be done.

231
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:18,960
Jagat, you'll waste a year if
the college admissions period ends.

232
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,960
You should go to Bombay immediately.

233
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,490
- Okay.
- Go.

234
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,330
And write to Mr. Bhagwandas
that you're coming.

235
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,576
It's good that Jagat
has gone to Bombay...

236
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,580
to gain admission to the college.

237
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,400
Your marriage will also be
finalized by the time he returns.

238
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,640
And both the marriages
will happen at once.

239
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,020
I haven't seen the girl yet.

240
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,020
So why discuss the marriage?

241
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,710
To be honest, I don't like marriages.

242
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,960
I want to be free.

243
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,420
Just see her once.

244
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,220
And then tell me.

245
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,140
Brother, I'll also come
with you to see the girl.

246
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,470
To see the girl or someone else.

247
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,000
Get out of here.

248
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,300
It would've been good
for her if she would see.

249
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,900
But Jagat has gone to Bombay.

250
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,930
The Bombay then and Bombay
today are chalk and cheese.

251
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:38,300
When you went with your father,
you were this small.

252
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,490
I doubt you'd remember
anything from that time.

253
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,730
I recollect certain things.

254
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,200
Yes, uncle Bhagwandas. There
was a little girl at your place...

255
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,580
who used to get upset
with me while playing.

256
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,810
Oh. My daughter, Ramla.

257
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,620
She wanted to come to
the station to welcome you.

258
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,410
But she stayed back
because of the rehearsal.

259
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,320
- Rehearsal?
- Yes.

260
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,960
Ramla and some of her friends...

261
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,740
are going to stage a drama
to raise money...

262
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,520
for the needy and poor...

263
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,270
which includes
songs and dances also.

264
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,500
Really? Where?

265
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,480
At our house.

266
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,570
Don't worry.
You won't be able to get out of it.

267
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,540
Ramla knows that you sing well.

268
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,130
And she has a song ready...

269
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,476
for you and her to sing.

270
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,600
Really?

271
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,160
Ramla, we're tired.

272
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,430
The dance that we did is nice.

273
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,550
Right. Why are you insisting
on the dance of the gardener?

274
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,390
Be fair. These people haven't
seen the gardener's dance.

275
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,460
Very well.

276
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,930
Anyone? Get some flower pots.

277
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,970
The stunning and incomparable...

278
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,080
gardener has set out all alone

279
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,276
The newly wed and incomparable...

280
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,930
gardener has set out all alone

281
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,420
She picks off the delicate buds

282
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,900
She also plucks flowers
from every branch

283
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,300
Darn it. I escape the thorns...

284
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:42,350
and only gather
the fragrant flowers

285
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:50,620
Forgive the thorn
if he has pricked you

286
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:57,820
Let me go. I'm getting late

287
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:09,570
You're the one who's vain. And who
has coy eyes and a piercing stare

288
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,200
The branch which has
blossoming flowers

289
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,090
Where are you off to?

290
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,690
Let me go deliver the
flowers to the market

291
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,260
- What are you selling?
- Will you buy something?

292
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:07,710
- Yes.
- Jasmine, marigold and rose

293
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:14,820
I sell the garlands of
Maulsiri (flower) and Oasboondh

294
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:21,410
I don't want Jasmine or
Marigold or Gulmohar

295
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,900
I want your mesmeric eyes

296
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,660
And your embrace

297
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,710
You're the admirer of my eyes

298
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,510
But your admiration is not genuine

299
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:42,520
This is the garden of flowers
and the market of beauty

300
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,200
- Go away.
- Give me. Give me

301
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,260
- What?
- Jasmine, Marigold

302
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,090
You, the incomparable gardener

303
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,380
This is the gardener's dance.

304
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,040
- You saw it? Liked it?
- Nice.

305
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,680
You people have seen
both the performances.

306
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,350
Now tell me. Which dance
should we include in the drama?

307
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,800
The first dance is good.

308
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,800
What do you say, Mr. Motilal?

309
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,440
Yes, I second that.

310
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,410
So, the first dance
will be in the drama.

311
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,610
Okay. It will be first dance.

312
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,660
This will make the
drama more interesting.

313
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,060
Ramla, look, Jagat Narayan is here.

314
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,920
Welcome. Welcome.

315
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,710
We've been keenly awaiting your arrival.

316
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,380
Mr. Jagat Narayan.

317
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,380
About whom I have already told you.

318
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,860
Ms. Prabha. Mr. Sharma. Ms. lndira.

319
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,580
Mr. Motilal.

320
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,520
I've heard a lot about you.

321
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,006
I've heard that
you sing really well.

322
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,960
No, sir.
Singing and I are poles apart.

323
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,160
He's just being modest.

324
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,270
Okay, Ramla., rehearse the song
you'll sing with him.

325
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,540
No. No. He's tired.

326
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,640
Let him rest a little.

327
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,940
Come on. Let's go to your room.

328
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,850
Prabha, rehearse your song
till Mr. Jagat Narayan comes.

329
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,530
Very well.

330
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:41,390
I blinked my eyes

331
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:54,200
I lost my senses

332
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,790
I forgot my dreams

333
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:10,720
Everyone cheated me

334
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:18,900
This is what I sing

335
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:25,530
I blinked my eyes

336
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:38,140
I halted at the bank of the river

337
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:50,620
Watching the waves coming in

338
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:03,220
I halted at the bank of the river

339
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:15,380
I stood at the bank of the river,
deep in thought

340
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,980
What?

341
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:31,700
Had I been a river,
I would have gushed

342
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:39,780
I would have stood
at the river bank and pondered

343
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,280
What?

344
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:56,110
Had I been an ocean,
you would have merged in me

345
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:06,130
I would have hidden in a mountain

346
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:10,660
I would have flown on the ground

347
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:18,090
I would have got lost
in the jungle

348
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,760
I wouldn't have come

349
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:32,150
I would have sent the cloud
as the messenger

350
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:41,270
As small droplets
I would have sent my message

351
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,920
Then?

352
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,100
I would have fluttered

353
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,380
You would have been in a trance

354
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,060
I would have swayed

355
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,240
You would have shown attitude

356
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:02,220
I would have come running

357
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:08,000
And merged in the ocean

358
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:15,429
Don't lock eyes with me, beloved

359
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,500
This is what I sing

360
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:27,670
I blinked my eyes

361
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,550
When I go to the river bank,
I remember how we used to...

362
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:50,709
play together and sing together

363
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:55,980
When I come home...

364
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,040
I see his image in my mind

365
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,480
Mother...

366
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,760
you tell me...

367
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,100
how I can forget Jagat?

368
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,960
Take this.
I've brought your song.

369
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,440
- But I...
- Don't fuss like a singer.

370
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,660
I'm not fussing.

371
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,840
I really don't sing well.

372
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,970
So sing badly.

373
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,230
Not this song, Prabha.

374
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,130
Sing the monsoon song.

375
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,800
Yes. It's the monsoon season.

376
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,436
That song will be lovely.

377
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,860
Where did Ramla go?

378
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,010
She's gone to show
Mr. Jagat Narayan the song.

379
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,220
Come

380
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:01,190
Beloved, come

381
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,006
Get up, beloved

382
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:07,110
Sorrow has passed

383
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:11,800
The dawn of happiness is here

384
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,000
Ramla.

385
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:16,040
It's better that
you rehearse this love scene...

386
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,210
in the rehearsal room
and not here.

387
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,780
I know what's good and what's bad.

388
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,580
No need to tell me.

389
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,320
But you need to be
saved from humiliation.

390
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,860
You shouldn't forget
we're going to be married.

391
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,620
Teach me your ways
after we're married.

392
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,160
Not now.

393
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,940
Mr. Motilal, it's my fault.

394
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,980
I should have reached
the rehearsal room on time.

395
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,960
I'll go there.

396
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,470
You don't even consider how good
Heera has been to us.

397
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:14,560
She gave us shelter and food.

398
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,730
She treated us so lovingly.

399
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:23,180
In return you want
to ruin her only son's life?

400
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,560
Don't you feel ashamed?

401
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,680
Yes.

402
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,550
I've chosen the date
for the marriage.

403
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:39,180
But why has Shanti
still not come with Maya?

404
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,650
Maya must be feeling shy to come.

405
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,300
I'll bring her.

406
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,610
I don't understand anything.

407
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,030
We've been waiting for half an hour.

408
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,400
And the girl hasn't come.

409
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,870
Of course.

410
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,350
If Usha doesn't marry Jagat...

411
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,560
Jagat's studies will be discontinued

412
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,550
You can't marry Chandrakant.

413
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,640
But you can ruin Jagat's life.

414
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,380
We will see about the marriage.

415
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,290
Dear, at our request
Chandrakant has come to see you.

416
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:26,460
He's been waiting for a long time.

417
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,180
What will he say?

418
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,850
It's very humiliating.

419
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,650
Okay. I will come.

420
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,240
Wait.

421
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,650
What's the matter?

422
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,470
Whoever goes inside doesn't come out.

423
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,040
Usha, go and see.

424
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,320
Great! How can I
go inside uninvited?

425
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,870
Tell me, Chandrakant.

426
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,510
Glory to God.

427
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,440
I will fix the marriage date.

428
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:46,950
I became a recluse for you

429
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:53,090
Beloved, come

430
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:15,100
I have smeared the ash
of love on my body

431
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:21,080
Your lovely image dwells
in my heart

432
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,470
Lovely

433
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:33,650
I will revere you

434
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:39,420
I will venerate you with my eyes

435
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:53,100
I will offer my heart to you

436
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:06,560
Beloved, come

437
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,976
Get up, beloved

438
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,120
Sorrow has passed

439
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:17,930
The dawn of happiness is here

440
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,790
I am smitten

441
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,860
Lovely

442
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:40,286
The days of sorrow have passed

443
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:44,890
Now, it's happiness's turn

444
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,280
Marvelous! Marvelous!

445
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,880
This song will be the best.

446
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,200
Stop the rehearsal
and eat something.

447
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,070
- Jagat sang so well. Fabulous!
- Marvelous!

448
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,980
- This song will be the best.
- Sit.

449
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,840
- Sit.
- He sang marvelously!

450
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,400
Wow! You sang so well!

451
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,376
Everyone was praising your dancing
and singing.

452
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,476
Yes, I'm done with one performance.
This one is about to happen.

453
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,650
Mr. Motilal.

454
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,470
Superb dance. Excellent.

455
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,470
I was listening to her
song from the other room.

456
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:21,010
- Mr. Sharma, don't feel shy.
- Sharma doesn't feel shy. Thanks.

457
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,200
- Mr. Jagat.
- Thanks.

458
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,240
Mr. Jagat Narayan, you won't drink?

459
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,340
No. I don't drink.

460
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,540
Good. Otherwise you would
have surely gotten inebriated.

461
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,950
Motilal, there was
no need to say that.

462
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,950
What decency is this?

463
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,210
You're saying I'm not decent?

464
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,000
Very well.

465
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,080
Under these circumstances,
you shouldn't marry me.

466
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,410
It'll be an insult to you.

467
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,070
Jagat, you remember the promise
you gave me yesterday?

468
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:41,200
Yes. Ramla won't ever want
to see my face again.

469
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,140
What will you do?

470
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,200
You'll find out soon. Don't worry.

471
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,590
You're still standing here?

472
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,720
Go and change your clothes.

473
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,980
- Ours is the third scene.
- I'm going.

474
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,000
- Won't you buy it?
- Surely.

475
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,980
Tell me. What do I have to give?
Just empty your pockets.

476
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,290
That's it? Okay.

477
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,610
You've come.

478
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,350
How is it possible I wouldn't
come to see you?

479
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,040
I mean your play?

480
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:51,040
If I didn't have to prepare
for my scene...

481
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,800
I would surely watch your dance.

482
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,220
- What a dance!
- What?

483
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,820
Don't pretend.

484
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,400
I have heard some
Jagat Narayan has come.

485
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:06,830
He sings very well.

486
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,186
Yes. It's said in today's program...

487
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,990
his and Ramla's song is the best.

488
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,920
Meet Mr. Jagat Narayan.

489
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,180
Pleased to meet you.

490
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,100
- We came to hear your song.
- It's my fate.

491
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,130
What?

492
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,986
If I don't live up to your
expectations, you'll abuse me.

493
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:25,110
No. No.

494
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:27,710
The play is about to begin.

495
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,780
- Mannu, give me something to drink.
- What will you have?

496
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,910
- Lemonade?
- No. Whiskey and soda.

497
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,280
What?

498
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,720
Whiskey and soda.

499
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,140
Give me cake.

500
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:28,210
Give me one more peg.

501
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,000
The twinkle of your eyes

502
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:12,080
The fairy in the bottle
lost its splendor

503
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,700
Lost its splendor. And is fervent

504
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:19,340
She roams all over the town

505
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:20,930
Why?

506
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,526
The bar was proud

507
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:28,130
Somebody took the sparkling drink

508
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,000
The twinkle of your eyes

509
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,310
The rouge of your cheeks

510
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:02,180
Your mesmerizing eyes

511
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,710
My heart is smitten

512
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:09,300
My heart is fervent

513
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,920
Why?

514
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:15,090
The garden was proud of it

515
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:18,170
Somebody stole the
rouge of the flower

516
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,890
The rouge of your cheeks

517
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:57,080
The color of your hands

518
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,360
Henna is feeling coy

519
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,610
Leaves have withered

520
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:12,420
Gloom has settled over the garden

521
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,940
Why?

522
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,836
The garden was proud of it

523
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,110
Somebody stole the color of henna

524
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,890
The color of your hands

525
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,760
Now, it will be fun.

526
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,570
- Brother Jagat is coming.
- When?

527
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:02,330
He didn't given any details
about the train.

528
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:03,870
But he's left Bombay.

529
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:08,166
Are you going upstairs?

530
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,530
Send Shanti here.

531
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,050
Won't you give me a token
for Maya's marriage?

532
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,240
Yes.

533
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,300
Take this.

534
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:27,930
What happened, Heera?

535
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,260
Jagat is coming.

536
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,720
If he comes during the marriage,
he might create a problem.

537
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,560
Wow.

538
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:12,150
Don't worry.

539
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,920
- Your turn will also come.
- Don't joke.

540
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:17,610
The wedding procession
is waiting at the door.

541
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,200
Sister-in-law Maya must be waiting
for you, all decked up.

542
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:17,340
Jagat doesn't even care for Ramla.

543
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,750
But she's missing him a lot.

544
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,076
Look, today,
we took her to the movies...

545
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,560
thinking she would feel better.

546
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,290
But she didn't even watch the movie.

547
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:29,986
It's so strange.

548
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:33,580
A beautiful girl like Ramla
also couldn't win Jagat's heart.

549
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,820
I think he loves somebody else.

550
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,420
Where did Maya go?

551
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,860
Mother.

552
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:51,920
Maya has gone to her
in-law's house, son.

553
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:21,240
A world of hopes dwelled
in my heart

554
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:06,470
Lovely was the breeze

555
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:14,610
A garden of flowers blossomed

556
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:24,670
Then arrived autumn

557
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:35,300
The garden withered

558
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:59,370
All my sweet hopes dashed

559
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:33,910
A world of hopes dwelled
in my heart

560
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,880
How much farther is it?

561
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,320
We're nearly there.

562
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,270
Don't you hear the sound of music?

563
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:10,310
- Why is this music played?
- It's Mr. Jagat's wedding.

564
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,640
Mr. Jagat's wedding?

565
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,450
Stop. Let's go back.

566
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,760
Where? To the station?

567
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,090
Yes.

568
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:50,970
Stop. ls there any hotel here?

569
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,960
There's no hotel here.

570
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:54,620
Then where do travelers stay?

571
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,180
The Muslims stay at the inn,
the Hindus at the temple.

572
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:02,480
Take me to the temple.

573
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,610
Do you know into which family is
Mr. Jagat Narayan getting married?

574
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,380
Into Mr. Chandrakant's family.

575
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:22,830
Mannu. Mannu.

576
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,540
Yes, sir?

577
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:29,986
When will dinner be served?

578
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:31,470
I'm waiting for Ms. Ramla.

579
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,120
Where has Ramla gone?

580
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,590
I don't know, sir.

581
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,250
She didn't turn up for lunch, either.

582
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:40,010
- Did she refuse to have lunch?
- No.

583
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:43,010
What is this nonsense?

584
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,220
She never does this.

585
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,140
Go and check whether her
car is parked in the garage.

586
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,100
- Are you Hindu?
- Yes.

587
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:55,670
Are you married or single?

588
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,670
From where have you come?

589
01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:00,436
What business do you have here?
You should have stopped somewhere else.

590
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,370
How will you feel
comfortable in a temple?

591
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:04,200
Why are you concerned about it?

592
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,750
I'm Hindu. I have
the right to stop here.

593
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,860
Okay, let her stay here.

594
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,370
Hello, lndira?

595
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:27,430
Has Ramla come there?

596
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:32,910
No? She decided to catch a movie?

597
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:36,690
At Prabha's place?

598
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:39,550
All right. I'll call her.

599
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:58,450
Hello? Hello?

600
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:03,060
Prabha? Yes.

601
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,230
I wanted to inquire from you.

602
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:09,690
She didn't come there?

603
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:16,460
Then where has she gone?

604
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:21,490
Sir, Ms. Ramla's car
is parked in the garage.

605
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:24,700
The driver's been waiting
for her for a long time.

606
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:29,420
- Why?
- He says Ms. Ramla told him this morning...

607
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:33,230
she'd go and watch a movie...

608
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:35,560
with Prabha and lndira
in the evening.

609
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,480
He should be ready.

610
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:39,930
What is this dilemma?

611
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,360
Where has Ramla gone?

612
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:46,820
She never goes out without saying.

613
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,640
- Mannu.
- Yes, sir?

614
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:52,170
Get the car ready.

615
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:53,840
I'll go and look for her myself.

616
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:25,930
Let me look at Jagat to my
heart's content once. That's it.

617
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,040
Can you guide me
to Mr. Chandrakant's house...

618
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:26,600
where the wedding is taking place?

619
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:29,360
It's at some distance.
Go straight.

620
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:35,220
You saw? What did I tell you?

621
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:37,250
That girl is missing.

622
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:40,670
That young woman has gone
out at night for an outing.

623
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,140
It's not a good sign.

624
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:46,630
To hell with it! I am telling you.

625
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,750
She will defame our temple.
She's an indecent woman.

626
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:12,260
The dropping of the veneration plate
is a bad omen.

627
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,730
Oh, Lord, please save Jagat.

628
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:28,520
Why did the veneration
plate slip from my hands?

629
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:34,320
I hope no inauspicious thing occurs.

630
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:44,150
Oh, Lord, don't let any
trouble befall Jagat.

631
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:02,940
So Jagat's wedding got
solemnized by the grace of God.

632
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:08,320
Priest, it got solemnized but the
dropping of the veneration plate...

633
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,060
isn't a good omen.

634
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,910
I'll find its solution
on some auspicious date.

635
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:18,740
But I'm worried about Maya.

636
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:21,230
Why? What's wrong?

637
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,410
Mr. Chandrakant was complaining...

638
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,260
that she doesn't even speak to him.

639
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,850
She runs away as soon she spots him.

640
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:37,480
Mr. Chandrakant has a hot temper.

641
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:40,169
I wonder what he might do.

642
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:47,320
No. He hasn't come yet.

643
01:08:48,939 --> 01:08:50,479
I don't know when he'll return.

644
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,000
Thank God.

645
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:55,810
Motilal hasn't returned yet.

646
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:58,750
If he was here right now,
he would have wreaked havoc.

647
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:00,850
Yes. He's very cruel.

648
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:05,079
We should find Ramla
before he returns.

649
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:08,790
I repeat, send a telegram to Jagat.

650
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:11,220
Here. I've written it, too.

651
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:13,119
Give it to me.

652
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:19,810
But I'm sure that
Ramla will never go to Jagat...

653
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:22,660
after that day's incident.

654
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,410
Then where has he gone?

655
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:27,599
You searched for her high
and low last night.

656
01:09:27,819 --> 01:09:29,899
Wouldn't you have found
her if she was in Bombay?

657
01:09:30,729 --> 01:09:32,489
Is Bombay a small city?

658
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,550
Come on, let's go and check again.

659
01:09:44,149 --> 01:09:47,469
Mr. Bhagwandas had called up
to inquire when you'd return.

660
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:50,489
I told him I didn't know.

661
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:06,550
Hello? ls Mr. Bhagwandas at home?

662
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,980
Oh, Mr. Motilal has returned. Now?

663
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:19,340
Yes, sir? No.

664
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:22,140
Where has he gone? Yes?

665
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:24,570
And Ms. Ramla?

666
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:28,220
Pardon? What?

667
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,080
Sir, she too...

668
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:32,970
she has gone somewhere, too.

669
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:35,956
I don't know.

670
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:38,110
Inform them after they return
that I have reached...

671
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:39,790
and will come to meet them.

672
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:47,010
It's very bad. What should I do?

673
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:50,070
How should I inform sir?

674
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:53,260
I wonder where he must be.

675
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:10,130
If Jagat misbehaves with Usha
as Maya misbehaves with me...

676
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,750
I'll never let
Usha go to his place.

677
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,590
I agree about Maya.

678
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:18,620
But why are you
saying this about Jagat?

679
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,610
I'm saying so because his face was
downtrodden throughout the wedding.

680
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,396
Didn't you see how
disappointed he looked...

681
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:26,920
while taking the wedding vows?

682
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:29,180
And Usha was looking so oppressed.

683
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:30,930
None of them were happy.

684
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,860
I'll speak to Jagat's
mother about this.

685
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:38,780
I've instructed
Maya's mother about her.

686
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:41,410
- She'll explain to him.
- She'll never understand.

687
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:46,430
I wonder at which inauspicious
moment you had fixed these weddings.

688
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:50,140
Our lives will definitely be ruined.

689
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:56,140
She's not there, either.

690
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,880
Is Ms. Prabha there?

691
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:13,990
No?

692
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:32,940
Is Ms. lndira at home? No?

693
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:36,850
If Mr. Bhagwandas comes
there then inform him...

694
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:41,330
that Mr. Motilal has returned.

695
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:56,120
- Mannu, has he returned?
- No, sir.

696
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:59,790
- When will he return?
- I don't know sir.

697
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:03,270
All right, I'll wait for him.

698
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:20,910
This is Ramla's handwriting.

699
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:24,610
Mannu. Mannu.

700
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,640
Yes, sir?

701
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,960
Is Ramla in Bombay?

702
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,710
Yes, sir. She's about to return.

703
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:59,080
Liar. Traitor. Betrayer.

704
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:00,880
You're trying to deceive me?

705
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:05,460
Ramla has gone to Jagat. To Jagat.

706
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:11,030
So Ramla has gone to Jagat.

707
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:16,040
Wait. I'll teach a good lesson
to the both of them.

708
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:57,170
Mannu, did you call up and
inform that Motilal has returned?

709
01:14:57,470 --> 01:15:00,730
Yes, madam. He was here just now.

710
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,840
He's responsible for
my miserable plight.

711
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,200
Why?

712
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:13,950
Sir, I said that Ms. Ramla
is in Bombay, so...

713
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,600
So what?

714
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:20,930
He immediately called me a traitor,
liar and cheat...

715
01:15:21,170 --> 01:15:22,456
and thrashed me.

716
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:27,310
- Why?
- He said that Ramla isn't in Bombay.

717
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:29,360
She's gone to meet Jagat.

718
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:32,360
- What are you saying?
- Yes, sir.

719
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,660
How did he come to know?

720
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,650
- Through the letter.
- What letter?

721
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,420
Why didn't you tell us?

722
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:40,240
Wait. Don't panic, Mannu.

723
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:43,696
- Whose letter was it?
- I don't know, sir.

724
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,120
How did he get it?

725
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:47,980
All the letters were placed here.

726
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:49,730
He must have picked it up from them.

727
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:52,960
It may have been Ramla's letter
addressed to you.

728
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,440
Sir, the car is ready.

729
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:10,870
Sir, what should I say if
anyone asks when you'll return?

730
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,090
Say you don't know.
I've left town.

731
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,330
What right did he have
to read your letter?

732
01:16:21,530 --> 01:16:23,830
I wonder what else
is written in it.

733
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:26,690
Why are you so scared of Mr. Motilal?

734
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:30,070
I'll call him right away
and get all the information.

735
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:45,780
Hello?

736
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:49,120
Hello? ls Mr. Motilal at home?

737
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:52,090
No. He's gone out.

738
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:54,720
I don't know where.

739
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:58,070
Yes. By train.

740
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:03,730
Where must Motilal have gone?

741
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,450
He must have gone
after Jagat and Ramla.

742
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,450
Then they are done for!

743
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:10,160
- Then...
- Come on, let's go.

744
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,460
A telegram?

745
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,060
It's from Jagat.

746
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:25,320
Ramla hasn't reached there.

747
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,900
Then where has she gone?

748
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:39,540
Yes. Go this way.

749
01:17:39,690 --> 01:17:41,310
You'll come across
a verandah ahead...

750
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,130
where you'll find a door.

751
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:44,990
That's Mr. Jagat Narayan's room.

752
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:06,080
Usha, no one has control
over anyone's heart.

753
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,140
I am helpless.

754
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:09,960
I can't love you.

755
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,860
Then why did you marry me?

756
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,160
What could I have done?

757
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,160
My mother had already
promised your brother.

758
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:29,710
Usha. Usha, please forgive me.

759
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:32,750
I love someone else.

760
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,610
Someone else?

761
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:37,440
Why don't you say
that you love Ramla?

762
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:41,980
Wait. I'll kill both you and Ramla.

763
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,820
Why are you bothered whether
I stay here at night or go out?

764
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:51,850
Why not? If you will stay here,
you'll have to be decent.

765
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:54,180
Don't talk nonsense.
I'm a decent woman.

766
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:56,240
Don't have that misunderstanding,
madam.

767
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,110
I can guess your intentions.

768
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:01,180
A young girl has left her home alone.

769
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,110
Does it mean I'm indecent?

770
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:07,360
You may be pious but are not
worthy of staying at a temple.

771
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:18,130
I will definitely find out
the truth today. Tell me.

772
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:20,050
Why try and avoid me?

773
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,370
Tell me. Speak up.

774
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,310
Why argue with her?
Take her and drive her out.

775
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:30,190
Come on, get out.

776
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:59,110
But still... but still
you're my husband.

777
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,340
I am your wife.

778
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:04,270
We will be together all our lives.

779
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:06,820
How will we manage like this?

780
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:11,570
My heart has been
worshipping him since childhood.

781
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,270
God is aware how much
effort I've made.

782
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:19,070
I controlled my heart.

783
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:21,690
But I was unable to forget him.

784
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:23,500
I couldn't forget him.

785
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:49,070
So you don't have any place in
your heart for this unfortunate girl?

786
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:53,000
Is this your justice?
Is this your duty?

787
01:20:54,030 --> 01:21:01,920
Usha, I know it's a sin to
give your place to anyone else.

788
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:07,320
But... I am helpless.

789
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:14,430
God knows I tried my level
best but I couldn't forget her.

790
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:17,570
I couldn't forget her.

791
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:22,720
I will always be yours
by deeds and duty.

792
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:26,580
But I don't have any
control on my heart.

793
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:44,550
If you can't forget her, you
deserve to be with her and not me.

794
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:53,370
You won't get anything
but misery with me.

795
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,120
You go to her.

796
01:22:06,430 --> 01:22:08,630
Then you won't have any
relations with me and my family.

797
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,620
You don't have any
place for me in your heart.

798
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:24,810
You hate the mere sight of my face.

799
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:26,780
Please don't stay with me.

800
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,300
Go to her.

801
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:29,950
Go. Go.

802
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:11,260
You belong to Jagat, so go to him.

803
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,230
Come on. Get out.

804
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:25,830
Sir is completely drunk.

805
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:28,650
He's driven madam from the house.

806
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:35,760
Come on, let's bring madam back home.

807
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:39,010
Once he's rid of the hangover,
he'll regain his composure.

808
01:25:54,030 --> 01:25:57,910
Since childhood
I have worshipped him.

809
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:00,580
God is the witness.

810
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:05,670
I tried very hard
to control my feelings.

811
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:09,400
But I couldn't forget him.
I couldn't forget him.

812
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,490
How can Maya forget Jagat?

813
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:28,840
How can she forget him?

814
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:31,910
Maya.

815
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,140
Maya.

816
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,460
Maya.

817
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,520
Usha, I know.

818
01:26:48,730 --> 01:26:52,620
It's a sin to love
anyone besides you.

819
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:56,610
But I am helpless.

820
01:26:57,930 --> 01:26:59,330
God is the witness.

821
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,240
I tried very hard.

822
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:06,470
But I couldn't forget her.
I couldn't forget her.

823
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:09,710
It's not his fault.

824
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,790
He can't forget Maya.

825
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:15,400
Forgive me.

826
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:17,050
Where did you go?

827
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:23,190
We've been searching
for her for a long time.

828
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,280
Let's go and see.

829
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:48,450
Maya!
Maya!

830
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:53,070
They went out.

831
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:55,910
I don't know where they
might be in this storm.

832
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:01,950
Come on. Let's search for them.

833
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:15,850
Maya!
Maya!

834
01:28:17,690 --> 01:28:19,710
Jagat!
Jagat!

835
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:31,950
You go there.
You go here.

836
01:28:32,430 --> 01:28:33,840
I'll go this way.

837
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,940
Now, you know...

838
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:52,170
why I don't want
to create hurdles in love.

839
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:22,020
Dear, you'll marry the man
you love.
