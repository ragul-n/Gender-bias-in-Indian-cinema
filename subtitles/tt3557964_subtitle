1
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,440
"Two hearts bound to one life
That's how true love should be"

2
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,360
"Take my hand in yours And
you'll notice how I feel"

3
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,040
"Lighter than a cloud afloat
All worries flown away"

4
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,520
"If this what heaven feels
like we can do this everyday"

5
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,080
"That is love That is love"

6
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,320
"Oh! That is love That is love"

7
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,200
"I will be there for you
You can always count on me"

8
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,160
"That is love That is love"

9
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,520
"Oh! That is love That is love"

10
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,520
'Somehow Something...'

11
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,720
Hey!

12
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,200
How dare you try to escape?

13
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,600
You have no sense And my gun has no license

14
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,000
Stoopid fellow!

15
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,920
Get in

16
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,200
Amos! No worries, go ahead with
the wedding preparations, boss

17
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,200
I won't spare him at all

18
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,040
No wrong route I'll fix it right for you

19
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,040
Keep the balance amount you owe me in cash,
okay?

20
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,880
What are you glaring at me for?

21
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,160
Get in, man

22
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,600
Stoopid!

23
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,800
Move aside

24
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,240
'He looks familiar'

25
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,120
Yov! Who are you? Why did you kidnap me?

26
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,320
Where are we now?

27
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,400
Who was that on the pho-?

28
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,840
I do the questioning here

29
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,560
If you irritate me my gun will reply!

30
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,640
Okay... okay

31
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,040
Be careful

32
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,000
Uncle-

33
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,200
- Uncle... huh?
- Oh sorry... sorry

34
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,800
Sir...!

35
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,320
Just let me go, please I'm in a big mess

36
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,400
I have to stop a wedding

37
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,960
I must stop you!

38
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,200
"Earrings two storey tinkle a story"

39
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,120
"Half sari in the breeze flutters to teas-"

40
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,000
Why did it stop?

41
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,880
Do you watch films?

42
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
I do

43
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,240
Sing one of your favorite songs

44
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,400
Why that look? Don't think... sing

45
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,880
I can't sing

46
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,160
I'm not requesting you It is an order...
sing!

47
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,560
"Where are you taking me?"

48
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,200
Stop it! Are you questioning me again?

49
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,040
Yov! This is a song

50
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,840
Enough of your songs

51
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,960
- If you sing, I'll kill you
- Did I volunteer to sing?

52
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,440
Tell me some story

53
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,520
Start now

54
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,000
There once lived a cow with 2 calves

55
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,440
When they were grazing
in a forest, a tiger-

56
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,000
Cow died,
tiger fled Is this Aesop's fables for kids?

57
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,040
Who wants to hear your childhood story?

58
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,320
Stoopid fellow!

59
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,520
You'll have your own story to tell
Somehow some love would've happened!

60
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,840
Tell me how it all began

61
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,040
TELL!

62
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,120
'My name is Gautam'

63
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,920
'I have met many girls in my life'

64
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,840
'But Simran... she's different'

65
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,720
'She is amazing'

66
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,920
I am coming, Simran

67
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,480
'But God disposed before I proposed!'

68
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,160
Sim-ran

69
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,600
Please do something, doctor?

70
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,040
Don't worry I'll take care

71
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,840
Doc-tor!

72
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,240
Thank you

73
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,600
Do you like it?

74
00:08:12,126 --> 00:08:13,960
Has Dr Anand finished his rounds?

75
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,680
Yes, he's already going around Simran

76
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,080
- Who is Simran?
- This patient's girl friend

77
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,040
She came to see the patient
and hooked the doctor

78
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,240
What about him?

79
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,880
Instead of landing here
on just a stretcher...

80
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,360
...he got admitted by a chic figure

81
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,640
Careful, he might hear us

82
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,400
As if he is in any state
to set things right?

83
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,120
'Smt Lakshmi who heads Shanthi
child welfare association...'

84
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,400
'...has condemned child labor'

85
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,440
I strongly condemn child labor

86
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,440
We'll file cases on all
offenders and drag them to court

87
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,147
Do you know,
even I can file a case against you?!

88
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,800
This is also child labor

89
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,840
Are you a child?

90
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,600
It is 20 years since I
changed diapers for you

91
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,720
Mom...!

92
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,840
- Where did you go yesterday?
- To your sister's house

93
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,120
Don't give me all that crap

94
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,680
Where did you gallivant
using my sister as an excuse?

95
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,680
By all means indulge in your social service

96
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,800
But won't you ruin your health
if you are obsessed with it 24x7?

97
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,120
What's wrong with my health?

98
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,560
This is iron body

99
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,840
Whose, darling?

100
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,840
If you walk a little
fast you get breathless

101
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,280
You complain of pain in your knees often

102
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,960
If anything happens to
you I'll look after you

103
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,200
But who will take care of me?

104
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,760
Chocolate is your bum pal forever!

105
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,640
Sorry... sorry

106
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,600
Ooops! I almost forgot

107
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,440
You got a wedding invitation

108
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,800
- From whom?
- How will I know?

109
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,920
Marriage is last priority
for my entire gang!

110
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,440
Who is that unlucky fellow?

111
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,960
What is wrong if Simran gets married?

112
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,600
I know!

113
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,040
What 'I know'?

114
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,760
She dated him for 6 months
and is marrying someone else

115
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,080
How can Gautam take it?

116
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,600
He was the one who delayed
expressing his love to her

117
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,120
How can you blame her?

118
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,680
We are all attending her wedding

119
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,480
And that's final

120
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,640
Hey ducky! How can we decide?

121
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,200
Shouldn't we think of his plight?

122
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,680
How do you feel, dude?

123
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,800
Friends, God will offer many
girl friends to bad people

124
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,840
But in the end, he'll give them
a wife who is below pass mark!

125
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,560
But for good souls like me he'll
start with heart aches and break ups

126
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,200
You know He'll bless me
with a sooper figure as wife

127
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,080
- New theory!
- Look how he convinces himself

128
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,880
Mahesh, every girl who walks in with a
'hi' has said 'bye' to some guy!

129
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,800
Why should she call it off?
I'll do the honors royally

130
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,760
If not Simran then Sania Mirza

131
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,080
Hey! She's already married

132
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,600
Okay, some female!

133
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,080
I got sidetracked in haste
and fell in love with Simran

134
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,720
My range is different altogether

135
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,872
Forget your range What's your plan now?

136
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,600
I didn't miss her

137
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,520
She has to realize it is her loss

138
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,600
If just for a day gold rate
declines will gold lose its value?

139
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,160
If Power Star goes to America
James Bond will visit India

140
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,600
I swear I don't understand any of this

141
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,320
Try to understand what you can't understand

142
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,520
Understood?

143
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,280
I am very clear

144
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,480
We are all attending Simran's wedding

145
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,160
Thank God! At last we reached in one piece

146
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,800
Mahesh,
how did you drive nonstop without sleeping?

147
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,800
Do you know where food is being served?

148
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,320
Hey... hiiii!

149
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,200
Anand and Simran look sizzling hot together

150
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,640
Simran makes me sizzle too!

151
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,680
I left my wallet in the car I'll go and-

152
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,440
Hey... don't try the grand escape!
Why do you need money now?

153
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,560
Meet my husband, Dr Anand

154
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,000
Stop

155
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
Sir...?!

156
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,760
Where is the bar counter?

157
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,840
This side

158
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:58,320
"I learnt my lesson well
And about my Simran as well"

159
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
What kind of 'blessed' life is this?

160
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,720
Why should this accident happen to you?

161
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,400
Why did these 2 bond?

162
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,960
Why torture yourself to
see this blissful state?

163
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,800
She bent backwards for me And now...'
meet my husband'!

164
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,560
How stupid of me to come all this way?!

165
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,560
When I think of life I
feel like throwing up

166
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,280
Correct

167
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,840
Is Simran already pregnant and
puking after her honeymoon?

168
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,960
No, wait a minute I'm coming

169
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,520
This is another girl

170
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,000
Excuse me

171
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Sorry

172
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,480
Come, my dear!

173
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,720
Just because it is free booze
should you drink yourself senseless?

174
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,640
Come... come and sit here

175
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,880
Hey you! Move Don't hog all the space

176
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,720
Alcohol? Same brand!

177
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,520
I agree, men and women are equal

178
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,720
But even in getting sloshed?!

179
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,840
What about our 'nativity' then?

180
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,160
Where did it fall?

181
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,920
I've seen you somewhere

182
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,640
But where?

183
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,960
Hello... puking again, huh?

184
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,560
Excuse me What are you doing?

185
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,880
Where is it?

186
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,040
What?

187
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,480
My lucky bracelet

188
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,760
- Bracelet?
- Fallen somewhere

189
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,040
Down here?

190
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,160
Where?

191
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,600
There... no... here

192
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Here?

193
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,840
Here... right here

194
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
Stop... wait

195
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,960
You look there I'll also... follow you!

196
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,640
Nice game!

197
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,440
Where the hell did I lose it?

198
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,880
You look so familiar

199
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,160
My bracelet...?

200
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,800
Bracelet

201
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,240
You goddamn mongrel and rotten thief Anand

202
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,840
If I became slim you promised to marry me

203
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,240
In 6 months I lost 25 kilos

204
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,880
And you ditched me Will you ever prosper?

205
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,000
That bill board on Kodambakkam bridge

206
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,840
That's you? Not graphics?!

207
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,080
Shut up

208
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
I'm on a serious scolding spree

209
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,640
Don't disturb

210
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,360
You bloody dastard

211
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,600
Son of a mongrel!

212
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,720
Rascal

213
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:31,480
You married that scarecrow
Damn rotten disfigured face

214
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,360
- Uh... huh?
- Simran

215
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,600
Bloody Simran Donkey monkey pussycat

216
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,240
Hey! Why are you cussing her so decently?

217
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,840
My turn now

218
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,720
Wasted wastrel!

219
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,520
Villain of a vagabond

220
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,600
It... it... itch with a bee in front!

221
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,040
We are too far away She can't hear us

222
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,640
Let's go in and continue

223
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,000
You sit over here And I'll take this seat

224
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,680
Where do such scumbags come from?

225
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,680
Awwww... sorry, Miss Sulky-face

226
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,560
Come up with some local swear words

227
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,160
Local?

228
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,160
My left hand smacks your misshapen face

229
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,760
I meant a swear word Not a film's title!

230
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,400
Given a chance,
they will even name a film this way

231
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,720
Happy married life

232
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,960
Just watch, I'll dub
their dialogs from here

233
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,600
Our lineage is...

234
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,840
...a shameless one!

235
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,040
Thank God

236
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,960
My family is blessed as I am now
married to this numb numskull!

237
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,840
Her face says it all That she is a bad omen

238
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,120
Where are you taking her
for your honeymoon?

239
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,120
Boat riding in the Coovum river

240
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,880
But won't it stink to high Heaven?

241
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,440
More than our crappiness?!

242
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,040
Shall we bless them?

243
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,880
May all melody and harmony
not even peep into your lives!

244
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,200
I want to go for a drive

245
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,720
Which car?

246
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,800
That car

247
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,800
Thank God it didn't rain today

248
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
Yes, sir

249
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,920
'Tsunami' is here!

250
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,880
Did you see Nithya anywhere?

251
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,560
I asked you to keep an eye on her

252
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
She is already depressed
Go and find her now

253
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,280
Am I to blame for her depressed state?

254
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,560
You kept calling that doctor-nephew
of yours as my 'son-in-law'

255
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,160
He right royally thrashed
your hopes to the ground

256
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,760
We should be looking for a son-in-law,
not our daughter

257
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,320
That's absolutely brainless!

258
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,560
I don't even think of
you as a human being?!

259
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,680
Bang on...
otherwise would I have married you?!

260
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,600
- I'll kill you
- You are a monster

261
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:47,560
"Do you think you're a celebrity?"

262
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,320
"Top cat, cat's whiskers, VIP?"

263
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,280
"Get lost, you imbecile!
To fall in love, you need 1 female"

264
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,080
"Another girl to walk down the
aisle Take a hike, you moronic male"

265
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:19,120
"Of all the girls in the world, you
declared I was Miss Universe, no compare"

266
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,800
"Why did you end up as spouse
to some lunatic louse?"

267
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:36,440
"You think you're the best of the best?
Are you every girl's coolest quest?"

268
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:47,920
"Take a leap,
nutcase woman One madcap just to have fun"

269
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,720
"One to marry traditionally Fly the coop,
you fraud 420!"

270
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,400
"Cakes you gobbled unrestrained plus
daily coffee in gallons, I paid"

271
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,240
"For some dash of a creep,
coolly you washed your hands off me"

272
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:16,120
"Are you God's gift to (wo)mankind?
Are you 'pick of the litter' find?"

273
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,920
"Tell me, Miss Wussy!"

274
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,200
"Are you favorite of all, Mr Daffy?"

275
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,560
"When I added kilos to my weight
you went for a flat-belly mate"

276
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,080
"I became pencil-thin and you
chose a roly-poly chubby spouse"

277
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,040
"My email password I selected as your name,
you lunkhead"

278
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,800
"Passwords are not hard to pick
I'll change it, you yo-yo chick!"

279
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,160
"Are you a 'wise guy'
apple of everyone's eye?"

280
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:14,720
"Hey... hey 'High society miss'
Are you on the 'who's who' list?"

281
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,600
"Hey...
all-knowing almanac I'm also a Smart Alec"

282
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,720
- Just 1 look, flat you fell?
- 'Hi' and a date as well!

283
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,600
- Solid check mate
- Zip zap zoom heart rate

284
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,720
- Was I cute yesterday?
- Am I a fruit today?

285
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,080
- Girl, take a different route
- Total country brute!

286
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,080
"Tuck in a royal feast!"

287
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,480
"Quit the race, you drama queen!
One to graze the pastures green"

288
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:00,240
"Vamoose, you virus nonentity
A wife to make babies plenty"

289
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:06,280
"After the honeymoon, Miss Know-all
you'll know your stupidity and bawl"

290
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,800
"You'll name your daughter after
me in your ex-girl friend's memory"

291
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,640
"You think you're cream of the cream"

292
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:23,120
"Are you every single girl's dream?"

293
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:35,680
"Are you the leopard's spot?
You think you're a big shot?"

294
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,800
Have you got up at last?

295
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,760
Open the door please

296
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,760
I won't Get lost

297
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,880
I've been waiting out for 3 hours

298
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,400
Keep waiting I won't open the door

299
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,160
You heard the flash news?

300
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,520
Anand and Simran had a
major world war last night

301
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,320
It seems the wedding may be cancelled

302
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,560
Are they getting divorced so soon?

303
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,800
Even the elders fought

304
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,400
Did they come to blows?

305
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,920
That's what I dreamt

306
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Idiot

307
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,000
Your parents were the
ones who fought last night

308
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,160
Got it?

309
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,240
I won't bless them!

310
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,480
You know very well it
isn't my favorite, mom

311
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,640
You can eat plateful of 'pongal'
to your stomach's content

312
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,720
Where the hell are these morons?

313
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,680
Hi... I'm Nithya

314
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,760
Hi... Gautam

315
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Hyderabad...?

316
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,440
- Yeah
- I thought as much

317
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,920
I'm from Chennai

318
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,280
Way we met was sheer serendipity

319
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,760
Little embarrassing... but-

320
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,640
It's okay, I feel a little relieved now

321
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,480
- Good
- Yeah

322
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:07,320
Next time instead of dating
a doctor or engineer...

323
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,120
...get yourself a good hearted guy

324
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
You too

325
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,160
Instead of finding girls who will
hug you tight, find your Miss Right

326
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,040
I got to go

327
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,960
All the best

328
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,920
Alright

329
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,440
Take care, bye

330
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,360
"Two hearts bound to one life
That's how true love should be"

331
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:39,040
"Take my hand in yours And
you'll notice how I feel"

332
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,400
I know why you attended that wedding

333
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,800
You thought she'd immediately
ditch her groom and elope with you?

334
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,600
- No...!
- Then why?

335
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,920
Somehow something was nagging my heart

336
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,600
You are a 100% verbal diarrhea party!

337
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,680
When 1 just left your life
another fell into your arms

338
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,680
Sneaky thief!

339
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,760
Very 1st meeting you
drank and even sang a duet

340
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,880
Have a ball!

341
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,120
It wasn't a duet It was a tragic song

342
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,280
Don't think you can mislead me
by pulling the wool over my eyes!

343
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,120
Continue with your story

344
00:28:18,157 --> 00:28:20,880
'By the time I escaped
from 1 shock in my life...'

345
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,320
'...I got another shock!'

346
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,600
Sir, you can meet the doctor now

347
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,280
Doctor... my reports?

348
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,200
Just got the reports

349
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,760
Exactly what we wanted to avoid

350
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,320
No... no... no

351
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,080
I am sorry

352
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,040
Come on, Gautam

353
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,320
This is when you should be strong

354
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,640
You shouldn't lose faith

355
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,440
Doctor, how much longer?

356
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,400
Maximum 2 to 3 years

357
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,280
Can we just check just once more?

358
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,600
Don't worry

359
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,200
Scientists in USA have
started research in this

360
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
They'll definitely find some solution

361
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,960
Why should this happen to me?

362
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,200
Hair loss is so common

363
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,400
Doctor, I haven't got married even once

364
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,360
Don't worry

365
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,960
Being bald is a mishap

366
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,840
But that doesn't mean all men
who are bald will make a mistake

367
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,760
At times skinheads can
shine to great heights

368
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,120
What's the main reason for hair loss?

369
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,960
Tension naturally

370
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,720
Why are you tensed?

371
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,200
Because of hair loss!

372
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,800
Madcap!
Why are you boys so obsessed about hair?

373
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,280
Don't say 'you boys'

374
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,960
Only we know you are a girl

375
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,840
Hair loss is no big deal, dude

376
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,920
Imitate Super star Rajini in the movie
'Sivaji'

377
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,680
There is no record of
girls who laugh too much

378
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,840
And men who show off their crowning glory!

379
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,680
How many God-men sport long
hair and make a deep impact?

380
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,440
You'll share my same fate

381
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,080
Today, tomorrow or day after
your head is bound to be...

382
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,320
...as smooth as a cricket ground

383
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,960
Thank God, ladies don't have
to go through this problem!

384
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,520
Do you know you lose a strand of
hair every time you speak the truth?

385
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,400
That's why boys get bald faster

386
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,920
Girls grow their hair real loooong!

387
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:07,000
I'll go and take a leak

388
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,960
Please go for God's sake

389
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,280
Dude, repeat!

390
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,200
Excuse me... move... move

391
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,360
Why is she rushing into the gents'
toilet...?

392
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,040
Puking... all over again, huh?

393
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,520
- Gautam...?
- Exactly

394
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,400
How come you are here?

395
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,880
I should be the one
asking you this question!

396
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,200
This is for gents

397
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,040
Urgent

398
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,600
Welcome

399
00:31:41,228 --> 00:31:42,840
When did you come to Chennai?

400
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,160
I came with my friends from Hyderabad

401
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
You?

402
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840
That's my gang

403
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,440
Nice

404
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,640
For past 3 months your friend has tried
to hook that girl in the red dress

405
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,080
Didn't work out... right?

406
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,600
How do you know that?

407
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,600
I know to read faces!
You need special talent for it

408
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,760
You expect me to fall for all that crap?

409
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,600
Yeah? Watch

410
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,680
The girl in the corner

411
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,120
Her name starts with the letter 'P'

412
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,720
Pinky?

413
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,720
Less hair more brains

414
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,760
Anyone can guess that

415
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,880
She is a big time rowdy

416
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,760
She'll first swear and then speak!

417
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,280
Right?

418
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,680
I don't believe this!

419
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,320
Hey Nithu!

420
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,440
Sorry

421
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,240
She's my classmate

422
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,040
Long time no see When did you come?

423
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,880
Yesterday

424
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,640
I am staying at my uncle's place

425
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,720
I'm here for a week

426
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,520
Tomorrow let's go on a shopping spree

427
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,240
Shucks! I have an important meeting

428
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
I'm not in town tomorrow

429
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,280
There must be so many other jobless fellows

430
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,760
- Rope some sucker in
- Well and truly caught

431
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,360
Who?

432
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,000
You!

433
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,040
Me...?

434
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,560
Not me, I have loads of work to do

435
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,120
Don't you worry, Nithya

436
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,080
He'll come for sure

437
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,280
You know his job is a mind-blowing one

438
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,376
His job urges and ensures
entire Tamil Nadu is sleepless

439
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,360
Good evening viewers

440
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,200
In our mechanical existence...

441
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,640
...we are unable to perform
to the optimum in any job

442
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,120
For best action and satisfaction
for those who face this problem...

443
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,520
...Guruji here will explain how
Kujli + enhances your sex drive

444
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,400
Good evening

445
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,120
Whatever job you undertake
should be a grand slam!

446
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,880
No half measures

447
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,680
What happens if you take the middle course?

448
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,760
You'll be on a limp trip!

449
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,080
Thank you

450
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,880
They say barking dogs don't bite

451
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,720
Why? A dog should either bark or bite

452
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,840
It cannot do both at the same time

453
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:07,520
But our people want to
multi-task in 1 minute!

454
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,480
Is that possible?

455
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,960
Did you understand?

456
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,840
Here is a list of making out tips...

457
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,280
...arranged by Guruji Peniseri Linganatha-

458
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,960
Cut... cut... cut

459
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,920
You're changing my job!
What have I 'arranged'?

460
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,480
You could use the word
'technique' or 'idea'

461
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,680
Don't pronounce his name
to suit his profession!

462
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,440
He is Ponisseril Linganathan

463
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,600
Repeat after me

464
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,240
Peniseri Linganatha-

465
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,920
God help me!
Why can't you get your vowels in order?

466
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,040
Stop piling on to me

467
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,560
Your language skill is pathetic

468
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,080
Who the hell employed you?

469
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,960
So you are the cause?

470
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,320
A small blunder was the cause

471
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,440
Really?

472
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,240
- When?
- Not 'that' blunder

473
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,720
This is a different kind of wrong doing

474
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,280
Whenever she anchors for me...

475
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,960
...I've stuffed her with
cotton where God has forgotten!

476
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,360
Otherwise my Kujli+ and I
will be the laughing stock

477
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,520
Who is she? Did she find out?

478
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,920
Why is she laughing like this?

479
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,080
- Who is that girl?
- She is... she is-

480
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,000
You know her?

481
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,880
Next time I could take her

482
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,720
I meant as anchor in my show

483
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,520
Will you leave now?

484
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,520
What about her?

485
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,720
Take her by all means

486
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,120
Crap! Follow me

487
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,360
Coming

488
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,400
Your wife is really lucky

489
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,160
Why?

490
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,320
You have a doctorate in all techniques

491
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,720
Way off the mark!

492
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,800
In our TV channel we are assigned
different shows on different days

493
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,120
This time I was stuck with Mr Linganathan!

494
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,200
Why say it as if you hated it?

495
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,640
You were happy shooting it, right?

496
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,840
Are you done? Now tell me where to go

497
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,080
Shopping

498
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,080
Only window shopping?

499
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,000
I don't like anything here

500
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,720
You should enter a shop,
be clear, pick, bill, walk out

501
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:11,840
Instead we settled down here as
if we booked a room in a hotel

502
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,080
Ladies' shopping is a big secret

503
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,280
It's called psychology

504
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,600
A reason for wasting time

505
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,840
You need a separate degree for this

506
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:33,640
Girls don't have a choice in deciding
their names or which school to join

507
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,360
What course to study? Which guy to marry?

508
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,080
How many kids to have? What to name them?

509
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:47,120
They have no choice in
such important decisions

510
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:53,680
Only while shopping we are
left free to use our free will

511
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,800
If we like it we buy If not look elsewhere

512
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,520
Any doubts?

513
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,840
Good

514
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,360
Hey! Nice dress

515
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,200
Are you shooting in this shopping complex?

516
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,160
No, I came to shop for heroine's costumes

517
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Your heroine looks familiar

518
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,040
My cousin's relative's-

519
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,320
Oh! I remember Hyderabad wedding

520
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,240
Drink party

521
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,440
Car ride

522
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,000
- Last year we saw this same girl
- Both are 1 and the same chick

523
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,360
- That's what he's also saying
- You said she's your cousin!

524
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,080
Just a sudden idea

525
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,240
Idea?

526
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,800
Rush affair?

527
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,920
Shut up

528
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,920
Pinky asked me to take her
shopping when I met her in the pub

529
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,720
Lay off!
He has planned a well laid out time ahead

530
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,720
Compromise, dude

531
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,400
Compromise!

532
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,960
What are you guys up to?

533
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,560
Pah! Get lost

534
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,920
Jingley Nellie

535
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,640
You called me 'Nellie'?

536
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,680
Don't embarrass me in front of her,
I beg of you

537
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,200
Next time I'll pay your pub bill for sure

538
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,560
Hey Gautam! How's this?

539
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,120
Soooper!

540
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,120
So is that on you!!

541
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,880
Come

542
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,680
Why are we here?

543
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,560
Surprise

544
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,400
Are you related to the commissioner?

545
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,600
Huh huh... no

546
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,240
Do you also have a criminal background?

547
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,400
Gautam

548
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,960
Who knows?!

549
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
Sir...!

550
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,360
This little fellow looks smart

551
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,200
Is he the commissioner's son?

552
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,840
No, he is the commissioner!

553
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,280
Commissioner...?

554
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,080
- Sir
- Yes

555
00:39:08,653 --> 00:39:10,320
- Thank you
- We can go in, sir

556
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,520
He won't even come up to my knees
and he is the commissioner?!

557
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,760
Please

558
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,920
Come

559
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,320
You may please ask your questions now

560
00:39:38,326 --> 00:39:40,160
Congratulations, commissioner sir

561
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,880
Thanks to all of you

562
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:43,360
How do you feel, sir?

563
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,200
Great!

564
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,280
Do you want to say anything, sir?

565
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,520
1 minute

566
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,840
Is our city in the hands of this kid?

567
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,600
Yes

568
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,200
I will maintain strict
law and order in the city

569
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,320
He won't even reach up to the
theater counter to buy a ticket!

570
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,320
How will he be able to
encounter a criminal?

571
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,120
Sir, will you control the rowdies?

572
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,200
I'll eradicate them completely

573
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,520
Who is directing this episode?

574
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,760
God

575
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,880
Everyone must co-operate
to keep the city clean

576
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,880
He is suffering from blood cancer

577
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,960
He might live maximum for another month

578
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,640
People don't think God has defects

579
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,320
But God creates people with defects

580
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,240
I am a volunteer for 'Make a wish'

581
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,400
I came to know about his dream last month

582
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,680
I spoke to the DGP who agreed
to this on humanitarian grounds

583
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,840
His dream for a day

584
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,000
Today his ambition has been fulfilled

585
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,400
Maybe this might even be his last birthday

586
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,560
Your health problem?

587
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,280
No... no... please

588
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
Enough of questions

589
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,400
Please step out This way please

590
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,400
Please don't write about this child

591
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,280
Just write he was commissioner
for a day for a good cause

592
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,760
He doesn't know he has cancer

593
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,280
This was not organized for publicity

594
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,760
Please try to understand

595
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,960
This is my humble request

596
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,440
Will he live longer if we write about him?

597
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,520
Whaaat?!

598
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,920
What did you just say?

599
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,520
Did you think before asking that question?

600
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,560
If this news is telecast and
he happens to watch it...

601
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,080
...how will he feel if he knows
he has cancer and will die soon?

602
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,920
Imagine his trauma He's just 10 years old

603
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,840
Don't do this to hike
up your channel rating

604
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,480
I don't want your sympathy Humanity...
empathy

605
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,640
You are different today

606
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,600
Different means?

607
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,160
Means...?

608
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,600
Not your usual self

609
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,160
How?

610
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,680
Somehow... something

611
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:37,960
"My sweet honey bunny you filled my heart,
every artery"

612
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:47,400
"Benjamin bunny, like salt and sea my dear,
you merged into me"

613
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,280
"The whole world is in a dizzy tizzy,
Flopsy, with your cotton paws fuzzy"

614
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,960
"Heights unimaginable my petite-paws scale"

615
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,400
"My kisses night and day
as carrot-bait I'll sway"

616
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:16,480
"My dearest bunny, Flopsy"

617
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:22,040
"You fulfilled me, filling me"

618
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:55,720
"My every action you'll pry and peer
But the love-beats when will you hear?"

619
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:05,080
"Your scent will do, I'm under your spell
You don't have to spell it out as well"

620
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:10,160
"It's a blazing bush fire in the jungle!"

621
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,520
"My sweet honey bunny"

622
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:20,480
"You are in every pore of my body"

623
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,960
Shut up!

624
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:44,240
"Softly... gently...
my princess before I can try to caress"

625
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,040
"Like a tempest and how you
feasted on me... wow!"

626
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:58,400
"9 months and 9 days will fly pronto
I want 100 babies like you ditto"

627
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:04,200
"Goodness gracious... amigo!"

628
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:18,040
"My sweet honey bunny you
filled my heart totally"

629
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:27,480
"Benjamin bunny, like salt and sea
you submerged into me, specially"

630
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,360
"The whole world is in a dizzy tizzy,
Flopsy, with your cotton paws fuzzy"

631
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,920
"Heights unbelievable my pretty-paws scale"

632
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:44,560
"My kisses night and day will
be carrot-baits I'll display"

633
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,120
- Want?
- No, thanks

634
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,280
Already the nuts you eat
make you a nutcase sweet

635
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,720
Satisfy your taste buds 100%

636
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,000
What you just spooned in is 100 calories

637
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,840
What you are about to eat is 750 calories

638
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,240
If you eat all this and if
someone calls you by your name...

639
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:19,600
...you can only turn your head
like a fat slob of a table fan

640
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:25,000
By the way excessive
sweet creates hair loss!

641
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,720
What happened?

642
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,600
Hair will fall even if you
eat under the table it seems

643
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,560
Shut up, you idiot I saw someone I know

644
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,720
Who?

645
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,080
The couple over there

646
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,560
Lady in the brown dress?

647
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,600
Exactly

648
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,920
What's her name?

649
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,640
Chandramukhi! Now get lost

650
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,280
Will she say 'Lakalakalaka'
like the spirit in the movie?

651
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,440
Pooh! Keep quiet

652
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,040
You sit properly!

653
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,640
Is this how playful you are always?

654
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,640
This is not a game, madcap

655
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,960
If they see me,
they'll make mincemeat out of me

656
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,040
What?

657
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,560
They specialize in mincemeat

658
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,840
Mincemeat?

659
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,880
Isn't your name Chandramukhi?

660
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,240
- Do you know this girl?
- I don't know

661
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,640
Aren't you Gautam's friends?

662
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,440
Gautam...?

663
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,360
Gautam is here

664
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,840
Where?

665
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,720
- Hello mom
- Over there

666
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,720
Did my sister call you?
Ages since I saw her

667
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,800
Sis...?!

668
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,720
Terrific Wonderful

669
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,120
It's a wonderful life in
'The pursuit of happyness'

670
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,760
Are you real or am I dreaming?

671
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,960
Sis, I was just talking about you to mom!

672
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,240
And you are right in front of my eyes

673
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,000
Gods must be crazy!

674
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,080
Nithya, this is my dear sister

675
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,000
Kamal Hassan hasn't retired as yet

676
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,640
I swear, sis

677
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,080
Look right there

678
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,040
My bro-in-law

679
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,640
Do you know who he's talking to?

680
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,600
- Who?
- Our mom!

681
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,040
Who is this new chef you have
appointed without asking me?

682
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,360
My b-i-l? Have you stepped
into chef Damodaran's shoes?

683
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,000
In this house who else
will take such liberties?

684
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,240
Why did you brag that you know to cook?

685
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,440
I showed off all my
skills when I got married!

686
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,960
Cooking also turned out to be one of many

687
00:48:29,186 --> 00:48:31,520
My bad time! I got trapped with your sister

688
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,320
Oh! So you are already committed as a chef?

689
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,840
B-i-l! Your 'Chandramukhi'

690
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,880
Shall I dice the tomatoes for you?

691
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,880
- Okay
- 2 minutes

692
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,680
Whatever you may say my sis
respects you exclusively

693
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,520
Naturally...
hey, don't cut the tomatoes too small

694
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,440
Small will be perfect I know what to do

695
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,960
You stick to your work

696
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,960
Don't you have a conscience?

697
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,760
Like mother like daughter!

698
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,920
Shall we share a beer?

699
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,800
Don't get me into further trouble!

700
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,440
Okay, fine

701
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,880
What's special for lunch?

702
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,720
Huh... mincemeat!

703
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,760
I saw him with a girl in a restaurant

704
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,960
Nithya...?

705
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,960
- Maa...?
- Nail him down

706
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,520
- Steaming hot fritters ready
- What's cooking here?

707
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,680
How can a mother-in-law relax while
her son-in-law sweats in the kitchen?

708
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,400
Total waste buttering up
your dear brother-in-law

709
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,760
Your sister told me only about the
'mincemeat'

710
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,480
Your b-i-l spilled the beans, from
'under the table' to your 'pretence call'

711
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,880
How could you betray me like this?
Did you tell every itsy-bitsy detail?

712
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,560
Why not fill up all the blanks?

713
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,200
Me going to Hyderabad, meeting Nithya...

714
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,560
...my drunken stupor dance

715
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,360
- I won't blabber
- Why not?

716
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,040
Because you blurted it all now!

717
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,560
Oh God!

718
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,120
Ma, you look sooper in this sari

719
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,360
Who is Sathya?

720
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,680
Not Sathya, Nithya

721
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,120
Okay, who is Nithya?

722
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,200
I don't know who Nithya is

723
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,760
What a sly fox!

724
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,880
Tell me, Nithya

725
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,400
Bad signal

726
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,480
Nithya Menen, how are you?

727
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,000
I saw your film You were awesome

728
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,440
Hi Nithya Tell me now

729
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,520
What are you doing?

730
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,760
I don't understand Bengali
You better talk to me in Tamil

731
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,840
What are you doing?

732
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,240
That's more like Tamil!

733
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,160
Booze for breakfast, huh?

734
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,560
Idiot! I've fixed myself a face pack

735
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,120
Six pack abs?!

736
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,520
Shut up and come to Cafe Coffee day

737
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,280
I like the way you respect me

738
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,640
Why don't you give me your mobile number?

739
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,240
- We can catch up later
- I use only a land line number

740
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,880
No mobile phone?!

741
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,280
Girls nowadays will even forget to breathe!

742
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,280
But will they forget their mobile phone?

743
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,280
Very true

744
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,200
I lost 3 expensive mobiles

745
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,440
That's why I decided to stick to land line

746
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,200
What if you need to make a call urgently?

747
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,480
How many gullible idiots own a phone?

748
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,080
I'll borrow from one

749
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,800
Gautam, give me your phone

750
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,920
- You are that idiot?
- In flesh and blood

751
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,880
Good night

752
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,800
- Thank you so much
- For what?

753
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,160
For introducing me to your friends

754
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,840
It was your plan

755
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,080
Nithya

756
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,800
Uncle, 2 minutes

757
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:51,840
Hi uncle

758
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,640
They won't mind offering a lift
just to take a girl for a ride!

759
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,960
Is your uncle cursing me under his breath?

760
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,960
Nothing of that sort

761
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,720
I've told him in such a way he won't

762
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,200
Oh! Very nice

763
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,400
You glorified me as a good boy?

764
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,080
Who will believe all these tales?

765
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,160
Then?

766
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,280
Whether I certify you as
a good boy or a bad one...

767
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,600
...both spell disaster

768
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,360
The male gender itself
is a cause for trouble

769
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,320
So...?

770
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,160
That's why I've told him...

771
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,080
...you are gay!

772
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,880
Imagining yourself as gay?

773
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,880
See... very simple logic

774
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,800
If I go out with girls uncle will say
'security problem'

775
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,320
If I go out with boys he'll say
'something fishy'

776
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,400
So I chose the in between

777
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,120
That's why I said you are gay

778
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,720
However late I get back, no problem

779
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,480
Sorry... sorry... sorry

780
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,920
Gautam... my bag

781
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,200
Are you trying to signal something?

782
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,520
Zip your lips and lie down

783
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,040
Control yourself

784
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,400
Every dog has its day

785
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,240
You will get your turn Mister Chocolate

786
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:14,960
One little Julie will come into your
life And your tail will wag automatically

787
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,960
So till then don't get tempted

788
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,320
Good boy

789
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,240
Ma, did you fall in love and get married?

790
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,040
Go away now

791
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,280
Then it's definitely 'yes'

792
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,400
Tell me, mom

793
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,160
Please tell me

794
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,520
Please

795
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,000
- What do you want me to tell?
- Your love story

796
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,440
Ours was an arranged marriage

797
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,920
Then any love affair before that?

798
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,080
Sorry... continue

799
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:07,520
Like normal practice there was a
'meeting the bride' formality

800
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:13,280
So did you play the veena
and sing a popular film song?

801
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,360
Not me, that is Sridevi in 'Meendum Kokila'

802
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,320
Nothing like that happened

803
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:22,160
I was in a half saree and I served coffee

804
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,800
Then I stood quietly in a corner

805
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,920
Then did my dad fall flat for you?

806
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,760
Waaait!
Suresh uncle had accompanied your dad

807
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,520
Oh! Suresh uncle was dad's sounding board

808
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,520
Just the opposite,
your dad was Suresh uncle's sounding board!

809
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,240
- What are you saying?
- Suresh uncle was the groom!

810
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,000
Very interesting break Tell me some more

811
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,920
Suresh was almost fixed as my husband

812
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,200
Pre climax Real tension

813
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,280
Suresh always consults your dad, no?

814
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,400
I know

815
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,200
When Suresh asked your dad
do you know what he said?

816
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,240
What did he say?

817
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,720
'That girl looks half mad It is your call'
he said

818
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,760
He was bang on!

819
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,320
That is the twist in the climax

820
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,000
Trusting his best friend,
Suresh uncle dropped me like a hot potato

821
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,800
After some days...

822
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,360
...your dad was such a 'drama king'
He pretended to be the martyr

823
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,800
And he married me

824
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,840
That's how much your dad loved me

825
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,120
Dad, you are a rock star

826
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,200
How did you feel 1st time you met dad?

827
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,400
He is the right guy for you?

828
00:56:33,817 --> 00:56:36,040
I felt like lightning flashing in the sky

829
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,200
My whole body was electrified

830
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,080
Colorful butterflies fluttering
their wings in my heart

831
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,280
- Really?
- Not at all

832
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,320
All this will happen only in reel life

833
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,200
Not in real life

834
00:56:48,957 --> 00:56:51,680
Do you know when you will
identify your soul mate?

835
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,920
When?

836
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,360
When it touches the right chord here

837
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,960
"Like a dimwitted dumbass"

838
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:51,080
"Hey! As a lame-brain ignoramus"

839
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:55,200
"Why did I become such
a buffoon and a bum?"

840
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,320
"My heart crushed into a ball
why did I throw it once for all?"

841
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,320
"Sky is a green lawn for me to graze on"

842
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,400
"I search, research and peep
Why my life changes deep?"

843
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:15,120
"This isn't the earth I live in, I swear
This isn't the 'me' within, I declare"

844
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:23,080
"I lie glibly, I swear I'm good at it
But you're not the cause for my habit"

845
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:31,320
"This isn't the earth I live in, I swear
This isn't the 'me' within, I declare"

846
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:39,240
"I promise I am a seasoned liar
You're not the reason, my dear"

847
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,000
"Like a dullard, dud and dodo"

848
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,800
"Hey! A senseless stupid fellow"

849
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,200
"Life is like a story"

850
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,720
"You can take it anywhere you want"

851
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,720
"What you feeling baby,
just come out and say it anyhow you want"

852
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,320
"Gotta take it slowly"

853
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,880
"Don't wanna miss the little
things that come my way"

854
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,280
"Wanna be your blessing and
light up everyone today"

855
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:27,640
"I'd have met a 1000 girls possibly
Fallen in love with 6 or 7 plausibly"

856
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:34,680
"My world never changed
then Now how did it happen?"

857
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:43,600
"Paper is the wall to write
My nose is the pen so right"

858
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:51,240
"Into the blue ink my nose I sink
to write your name in total sync"

859
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:55,400
"Your finger is my oxygen"

860
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,440
"I think topsy turvy often"

861
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,440
"To spoon feed in your ear I hasten"

862
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:11,480
"This isn't the earth I live in, I swear
This isn't the 'me' within, I declare"

863
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:19,520
"I promise I am a seasoned liar
You're not the reason, my dear"

864
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,600
"Bring it to the floor,
get your stuff and let's go"

865
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,640
"I know you want some
more of this mad beat yo"

866
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,680
"It's the heat it's hot,
it's the beat it's what"

867
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,360
"Shake your body Shake your body"

868
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,600
"Come, join the gang"

869
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,880
"Fool... idiot... brainless"

870
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,200
"Hey! King of dumbness"

871
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,680
"Why did I become such a clown and a bum?"

872
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,680
"My heart crushed into a ball
why did I throw it once for all?"

873
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,600
"Sky is a green lawn for me to graze on"

874
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,800
"I search, research and peep
Why my life changes deep?"

875
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:09,400
"This isn't the land I love I'm sure
This isn't I, me, myself either"

876
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:17,240
"I can certify I lie 24x7x365
You're not the reason why"

877
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:45,280
Nithya, do you know when you
entered this special spot?

878
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,040
Your social service...

879
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,040
...beats my mother's dedication hollow

880
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,920
- Hi Gautam
- Tell me, Nithya

881
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,120
Come to the railway station

882
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,120
I'll be there in 10 minutes

883
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,200
Nithyaaaa!

884
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:27,120
Why did you call me all of a sudden?

885
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,360
My dad wants me back urgently

886
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,680
Do you have to go today?

887
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,680
Can't you avoid it?

888
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:41,200
I'd love to stay a few days
more But I have no other go

889
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:47,440
I forgot... you wanted
to tell me something?

890
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,480
- Huh... uh... hmm
- What is it, Gautam?

891
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,680
Let me tell you, wait

892
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,360
Remember... the 1st time we met

893
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:04,320
No... the 2nd time we met

894
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,760
No... no... no Forget that

895
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,160
3rd time we met

896
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:16,440
4th time also we met, right?

897
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,080
Not then

898
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:22,360
5th time when we met

899
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:19,040
You planned it all I thought as much

900
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,680
Isn't that Gautam?

901
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,440
Finally, man

902
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,760
Awesome to see you

903
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:37,000
If I talk to her for half an hour she
talks only about you for 20 minutes

904
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,720
1st it was very boring

905
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,600
In fact bugging too

906
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:44,440
Then... you care for my Nithya so much

907
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,720
I was bowled over! That's why I love you!!

908
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,080
- Shameless
- Why should I feel bad?

909
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:52,160
1st time I looked at your snap
and immediately said 'yes'

910
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,640
And we got engaged, right?

911
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,040
Should not delay such things, dear

912
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,120
What do you say, brother?

913
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,680
Let me check about our tickets

914
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,600
I enjoyed myself thoroughly in Chennai

915
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,640
All thanks to you, Gautam

916
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,880
Next time your turn to
visit me in Hyderabad

917
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,240
- Nithya?
- Coming

918
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:34,840
You wanted to say something I'll call you,
then you can tell me

919
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,320
Thanks for everything

920
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,040
So Nithya said 'tata byebye see you'

921
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,880
From stone age same story repeats itself

922
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:03,840
When you buy a car,
you check the model and its mileage

923
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,560
But when you start dating a girl you
don't verify if she has a lover or not?

924
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,040
Stupid... stoopid fellows

925
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,600
She has left you empty handed now

926
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:15,080
I am fully equipped!

927
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,720
It's a gun Don't play with it

928
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,120
Only if I bump you off
I can stop the wedding

929
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,880
Give me the car keys

930
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,360
- Take it out
- Wait, I will

931
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,400
Can't find it Aah! Here it is

932
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,080
Don't play games

933
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,520
Hey! I load only 2 bullets at a time,
that gun is empty

934
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:57,480
My dear boy, you must propose at
the right time for your love to win

935
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:01,200
Same way,
a gun can't be fired without bullets

936
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,760
You are a small boy

937
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:07,680
Give me the gun Not safe in your hands

938
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,920
Fooled you, eh?

939
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,640
You take the gun from me again,
you'll be a dead duck doomed

940
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,360
Bloody! Continue What happened next?

941
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,800
Tell me

942
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,920
Dhoni is ultimate!

943
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,280
Maaaa... don't miss Dhoni

944
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,800
Gautam, get up

945
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,480
Get up, da

946
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,080
Go away, ma

947
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,360
Can't you hear me?

948
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,800
Get up now

949
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:11,000
Awww! You are hurting me

950
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,080
Don't run Gautam...!

951
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:16,800
Wait... listen to me

952
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,800
Lakshmi... no!

953
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:23,680
You dare call me by my name!

954
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,280
Why do you hit me like a school teacher?

955
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:33,200
At your age why get into this?

956
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,400
That's exactly what I am asking you too!

957
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,960
At this young age what's bothering you?

958
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,280
As if it is end of the world...?

959
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,600
It is 10 years since your dad died

960
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,440
If I had also mooned around in a corner...

961
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:57,680
...do you think you, me, your sister
would have been like this today?

962
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,400
When people close to our
heart leave us behind...

963
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,840
...it is tough to bear the pain

964
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,400
Some people keep mourning
and crying all the time

965
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:13,320
But others move on with
all their sweet memories

966
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,160
You are my son

967
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:21,840
I don't have to tell you what to do

968
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,920
Coffee?

969
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:32,880
Given a chance your dad will
telecast our wedding 'live'?

970
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,400
This is too much

971
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:39,320
Do you know Gautam is an
expert in TV programming?

972
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,720
But stupid fellow

973
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,760
I don't know why he is behaving like this

974
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,400
Raja, give me your phone

975
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,080
To Gautam again?

976
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,680
No reply

977
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,680
No reply to any of my calls or my emails

978
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:00,160
Acting pricey So irritating

979
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,640
Relax...
don't call Then you won't be irritated

980
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,080
He's my friend, Raja

981
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,840
What does that smile mean?

982
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,720
Nothing, take it easy

983
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,640
No, tell me

984
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,480
Nithya, just because you are engaged,
it doesn't mean...

985
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,320
...you should not like another person

986
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,400
What?

987
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,320
What are you saying?

988
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,760
Ever since you returned from Chennai...

989
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,120
...you've sent some 20 messages
and made 30 calls to Gautam

990
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,320
So...?

991
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,640
I am not doubting you

992
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:39,400
Then you are keeping tabs
30 calls 20 messages?

993
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,240
Look, all I am saying is...

994
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,960
...some introductions
can turn into friendship

995
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,680
While some friendship can
even blossom into love

996
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,760
We ourselves won't have a
clue what can happen and when!

997
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,000
Even I am not realizing that

998
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
So...
are you claiming I am in love with Gautam?

999
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,800
No, I'm asking you to take a rain check

1000
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,840
After getting engaged to you...

1001
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,800
...you think I may be in
love with someone else?

1002
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,400
Actually... no I am saying-

1003
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,240
Wait... wait

1004
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,320
You are suspecting me before the wedding

1005
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,640
Suppose you get these
doubts after we are married?

1006
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,240
Come on, Nithya Try to-

1007
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,520
Please

1008
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,040
You know what, Raja?

1009
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:31,800
If you don't believe in
me this will not work out

1010
01:11:55,120 --> 01:12:00,280
"Shut up your mouth Shhhh... pipe down!"

1011
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:05,200
"Shut up your mouth Shhhh...
hold your tongue!"

1012
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:09,480
"Shut up your mouth Put the lid on...
hush!"

1013
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:14,000
"Shut up your mouth Zip your lips...
shush!"

1014
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:18,800
"Hey...
you show-stopper Why this show of anger?"

1015
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:24,000
"Hey... son of a celebrity
Hotshot, come close to me"

1016
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:28,920
"Hey you... lovable lad?
Why are you hopping mad?"

1017
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,680
"Hey Mr Awesome, don't tease,
come to me, will you please!"

1018
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:39,600
"Shut up your mouth Don't trumpet and tout"

1019
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:44,480
"Shut up your mouth Shhhh... no doubt!"

1020
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:49,480
"Lashes made of caffeine
Lips of cocoa lustrous sheen"

1021
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:54,560
"Glam-doll as a cocktail mix
earthly desires I offer to fix"

1022
01:12:54,640 --> 01:13:00,040
"For you to feast on me
you were created specially"

1023
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:04,880
"Cover a pot over your head
Shut your gob or drop dead!"

1024
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:23,800
"Beauty is the reason for
heartache by the gallon"

1025
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:28,880
"Oscillating heart is a doomsday dart"

1026
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:34,000
"Like waves wavering ebb and flow
you swoon in my beauty head to toe"

1027
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:39,080
"Come, graze in close proximity
You bask in my fire with vitality"

1028
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:45,160
"Without batting an eye lid,
bang on to her beauty you are drawn"

1029
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:50,520
"Shut up your mouth Don't
blabber and brag about!"

1030
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,200
"Shut up your mouth"

1031
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:28,880
"My heart is scarred In
the same spot marred"

1032
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,000
"I became a beast Why is that such a feat?"

1033
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:39,000
"My job is to kiss your hurt
To paradise I'll transport"

1034
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:44,080
"As a needle into your skin I'll
inject joys to multiply within"

1035
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:50,320
"I'll relieve your pain with pain
You'll re-live pleasure again"

1036
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:54,320
"Shut up your mouth Hey!
Let your body shout"

1037
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:59,000
"Hey...
handsome hulk Why are you awestruck?"

1038
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:04,320
"Hey heartbreaker of a guy!
My eyes are the reason why"

1039
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:09,040
"Hey sweet talker intoxicated
Let yesterday be deleted"

1040
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:14,960
"Hey charmer I declare in
your breath I'm the air"

1041
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:20,720
"Shut up your mouth Zip your lips...
shush!"

1042
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,640
'Few weeks later...'

1043
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:31,560
Why have we come to a veterinary hospital?

1044
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,480
Look over there

1045
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,840
Look 'at what' over there?

1046
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:40,600
My dear dear Kavya

1047
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,080
Doctor for pets and all beloved beasts

1048
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,360
She seems very familiar?!

1049
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:53,600
"For you to treat me you
were made specifically"

1050
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,760
"Shut up your mouth"

1051
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,240
Enough of your reactions

1052
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,400
6 weeks dating Most happening

1053
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,920
- How do you do it?
- All thanks to Chocolate

1054
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,480
I can also adopt a pet dog

1055
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:15,840
Hi guys

1056
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,680
Hey Chocolate!

1057
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,320
How is he now?

1058
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,520
Has the infection lessened?

1059
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,200
Continue the medicine for another week

1060
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:31,880
Gautam,
will you come home on Friday definitely?

1061
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,640
I will be there for sure, sweetie

1062
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,640
Thanks

1063
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,040
Madam, phone

1065
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:41,560

1066
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:47,080
Telugu girl? You never told me!

1067
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:48,960
What?

1068
01:16:56,680 --> 01:17:00,240
Good heavens! Your quota overflows

1069
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:04,000
Nithya was your target
And now a Telugu vet!

1070
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,160
You are an animal, man

1071
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,400
Then what happened?

1072
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,920
Then one day in Chengelpet-

1073
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,160
'Red Cross Society organized a
flood relief camp and I went...'

1074
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:18,000
'...to cover the news for my TV channel'

1075
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,680
Take this

1076
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,200
I'll be right back

1077
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,640
What a surprise?!

1078
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,080
Nithya... Nithya?

1079
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,200
It has been decades since I saw you last

1080
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,400
I carried your bags after shopping, right?

1081
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,200
You forget your friends so easily

1082
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,360
You call yourself my friend!

1083
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:23,880
Did it occur to you to reply
to just 1 e-mail or phone call?

1084
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,560
You know what? Just forget it

1085
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,840
Nithya... Nithya

1086
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,840
Come on, Nithya

1087
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:39,240
Tell me, what should I do now?

1088
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:53,120
'Whatever job you undertake
should be a grand slam!'

1089
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,800
'No half measures'

1090
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:01,240
'If you take the middle course
you'll be on a limp tri-'

1091
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:11,440
'Appalam' cannot be eaten whole
It has to be broken, right?

1092
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:16,280
But if already broken will we relish it?

1093
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:21,960
Only if we ourselves do
the job will we enjo-

1094
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:27,160
I am so happy

1095
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,760
How is Raja?

1096
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:36,000
Why didn't you invite me for your wedding?

1097
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,760
Raja and I broke up

1098
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,240
I am sorry

1099
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,040
How?

1100
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:53,640
That's a long story It
just did not work out

1101
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,480
But no regrets That's fine

1102
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,800
Don't worry

1103
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:04,840
Whatever is already written
for whomever will only happen

1104
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:11,040
Lucky fellow he escaped Wonder who is next?

1105
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,560
- Stupid
- Come on!

1106
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:22,960
It has been ages you know since I
laughed or spoke freely like this

1107
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,600
You should always keep laughing

1108
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,400
Do you know how beautiful
you look when you laugh

1109
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:33,160
Enough... your compliments choke me

1110
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,240
Time just flies when I talk to you

1111
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,120
Wow...!

1112
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,640
Oh no! What's the time?

1113
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,440
11:30?

1114
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:46,600
Looks like it will be very late
by the time I reach the city

1115
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,160
Where are you staying?

1116
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,000
Not yet decided

1117
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,680
Okay, I've decided

1118
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,680
Come in quietly

1119
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:14,360
Be comfortable Sleep, sweet dreams

1120
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,760
I will see you in the morning

1121
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,920
Nithya, do you want any booze?

1122
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,520
Hey, stupid!

1123
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,680
Good night!

1124
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:38,040
Hiiiiii! Who are you?

1125
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,280
Come on, cutie!

1126
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,000
What is this?

1127
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:51,960
'Good morning!
Going out Will be back in an hour'

1128
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,760
'Stay in the room'

1129
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,680
'If my mom sees you we'll be in a soup'

1130
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,960
'By the way his name is Chocolate'

1131
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,680
Where are you, Gautam?

1132
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:13,320
I need to rush to the bathroom

1133
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,520
Chocolate, show me the bathroom

1134
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,360
Good morning

1135
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,560
Bathroom? Straight and left

1136
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:37,960
Mom...? Tell me

1137
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,080
Has she got up?

1138
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,440
Don't know when she woke up

1139
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,680
But she came out of the room on all fours!

1140
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:43,640
Poor thing!

1141
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,880
You don't know her

1142
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,720
She'll sell you and me for a king's ransom!

1143
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,600
You are too hard on her
She looks very innocent

1144
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,760
That's her glorious trap!

1145
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,800
If you fall for it that's
the end of the story

1146
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,960
I'll take care

1147
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,480
Sorry, aunty

1148
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:07,240
Gautam is not at fault It
was quite late last night

1149
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,440
That's why without your knowledge-

1150
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:12,960
Nithya,
Gautam told me last night itself about you

1151
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,920
He told you last night?

1152
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,280
Such an idiot!

1153
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,360
Sorry aunty, but he is really an idiot 100%

1154
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:23,560
And this is his bosom pal!

1155
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,720
Is this you?

1156
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,920
Gautam is ditto you

1157
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,800
Only in looks

1158
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:38,120
But his nature is ditto his dad
And that is what troubles me

1159
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,240
Why, aunty?

1160
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,720
Isn't he a cool chap?

1161
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,840
You tell me

1162
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,760
As far as I know he's real cool

1163
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,600
Very jovial Not finicky

1164
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:50,400
But very sensitive

1165
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,120
Tell... tell me more

1166
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:55,080
When I'm with Gautam time just flies

1167
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,240
I heard about it

1168
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:00,240
1st time when you met in Chennai
you painted the city red, I believe?

1169
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,440
Did he tell you?

1170
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,560
So embarrassing This is too much

1171
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,160
He has told you all my secrets

1172
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:11,960
Now you must share Gautam's secrets with me

1173
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,840
Gautam's secrets?

1174
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:38,680
Oh my goodness!
How did you handle him, aunty?

1175
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:41,560
I love his mischievous streak

1176
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:46,360
- Come, let's eat breakfast
- Let me take a shower

1177
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,920
Gents' toilet is on the left

1178
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:52,160
He told me that too!

1179
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:56,440
Aunty, when Gautam gets back, please
will you close your eyes for 2 minutes?

1180
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:00,040
- Why, what will you do?
- I'll hit him black and blue

1181
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,480
- Permission granted
- Thank you, aunty

1182
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,280
I like it, Gautam

1183
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:41,760
Your house, your mom, Chocolate,
I reeaaaally like it!

1184
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,920
That's Kavya His girlfriend

1185
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,120
He intends talking to her parents
and fixing the wedding date soon

1186
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:36,440
Mom, where's Nithya?

1187
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:39,080
- She left
- Where?

1188
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,440
She said some urgent work
in Hyderabad and left

1189
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,120
Didn't she call you?

1190
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,920
Is she mad or what?

1191
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,240
Why come and then why vanish
into thin air like this?

1192
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,680
Is Hyderabad nearby?

1193
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:49,840
Let me call-

1194
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,520
Oh! I erased her phone number

1195
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,720
I'll go mad because of her

1196
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:05,240
"How much worse can it get?"

1197
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:09,120
"This 'bolt from the blue' regret?"

1198
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:13,520
"Love's catastrophe?"

1199
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:17,240
"How will I face this calamity?"

1200
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:21,160
"Isn't this misery enough for me"

1201
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:29,160
"Why did I mess up my life into
a question mark of strife?"

1202
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:37,280
"My tears that touch my toes beg
forgiveness filled with woes"

1203
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:46,920
"However my heart hard and dense
is having fun at my expense"

1204
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,360
"Won't this unholy mess do?"

1205
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:04,600
"Love's folly and my Waterloo
How will I live without you?"

1206
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:14,160
"Why did I make my life a riddle?
How do I solve this insane puzzle?"

1207
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:28,120
I've booked rooms for your friends
Let me know if you need anything else

1208
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,320
You were right

1209
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:40,080
- About what?
- About me

1210
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:42,880
I am mad I deserve this

1211
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:44,360
What happened, Nithya?

1212
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:48,560
My relationship with Gautam
Didn't you ask me to check?

1213
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:52,080
I felt that way then

1214
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:56,240
Then, now and always That's the only truth

1215
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:01,600
Raja, I'm in love with Gautam

1216
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:04,680
Hey! Congrats

1217
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:09,240
Why are you upset about this?
Did you tell Gautam?

1218
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:11,960
He is marrying Kavya it seems

1219
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,600
- Who is Kavya?
- His fiancee

1220
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,600
All because of you

1221
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:22,680
Instead of saying check you
could've said it is confirmed

1222
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:25,000
It's so late now

1223
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:28,680
Why was that idiot Gautam
in such a tearing hurry?

1224
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:32,360
Couldn't he have waited till
I expressed my love for him?

1225
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,080
Sorry once again

1226
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:37,240
Why?

1227
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,920
I disturbed your function

1228
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,160
Shall I leave now?

1229
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:46,200
Thanks

1230
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:48,600
Bye

1231
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,120
Gautam, have you started?

1232
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,520
Yes, just about leaving

1233
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:02,360
Everyone is waiting here for you

1234
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:05,080
I have convinced my parents with
great difficulty to meet you

1235
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,800
Please... make it fast

1236
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,720
I am leaving right now

1237
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:11,960
I am wearing your favourite blue shirt

1238
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:15,040
Your entire family will accept me,
just wait and see

1239
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:17,120
I'm leaving right away

1240
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:22,560
'Very jovial Not finicky'

1241
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,200
'But very sensitive'

1242
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:27,440
'When I'm with Gautam time just flies,
aunty'

1243
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:28,640
Bye, ma

1244
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:30,080
Gautam

1245
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:32,320
- What?
- 1 minute

1246
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,040
Quick, I'm late as it is

1247
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:37,800
Gautam, is this what you really want?

1248
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,200
Want what?

1249
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,520
Gawd!

1250
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,560
Hello! I am half way through

1251
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,160
Can't you hear the traffic?

1252
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,520
Bye, ma

1253
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:49,320
I'm just around the corner

1254
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,120
Gautam!

1255
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:02,880
Why are you so late?

1256
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,200
Wow! You look soooper in this white dress

1257
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:08,360
Sweets for my sweetie!

1258
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:12,320
Please, Gautam Somehow impress my dad

1259
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,600
Trust me I'll take care

1260
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:17,200
Come inside

1261
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:20,520
Finish all the work I
don't want anything pending

1262
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,520
Father, Gautam

1263
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:23,800
Welcome, young man

1264
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:25,920
Kavya has talked nonstop about you

1265
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,720
Happy Telugu new year, uncle

1266
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:30,440
Didn't I tell you? Kavya's friend Gautam

1267
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,720
This is my friend Sundaram

1268
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:35,880
You work in a TV channel, right?

1269
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,240
Correct, uncle

1270
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:39,200
Ma, come here

1271
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,320
1 minute I'll be back

1272
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,320
That's Kavya Isn't she very pretty?

1273
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,040
Ma, this is Gautam

1274
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:46,560
Greetings, aunty

1275
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:49,960
It would be nice if you
can offer him coffee or tea

1276
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,120
Kavya, come with me

1277
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,120
Gautam, you carry on

1278
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,680
Let me introduce you to everyone

1279
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,840
He seems very familiar

1280
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,920
'Compromise!'

1281
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,320
'What are you guys up to?'

1282
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:12,320
'Jingilee Nellie'

1283
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,960
You called me 'Nellie'?

1284
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,640
What is he doing here?

1285
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:19,880
I enjoyed your TV program Kujli plus

1286
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:24,360
Madan, when did you come?

1287
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:27,080
- Happy new year
- Same to you

1288
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:31,640
This is Kavya's friend
The one I told you about

1289
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
He is my childhood friend, Madan

1290
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:38,960
You seem very familiar

1291
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,600
I too feel the same

1292
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:45,080
Is that so?

1293
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:49,920
Wise men think alike and...!

1294
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Aren't you Nithya's uncle?

1295
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,880
Uncle, I'm Nithya's friend

1296
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:59,320
How could you forget me?

1297
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:02,640
How many times I've dropped
Nithya at your place?

1298
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:06,080
The one who used to drop her at home daily

1299
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:08,680
- Gautam...?
- Yes...!

1300
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:12,480
That same Gautam?

1301
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,160
Hey hey...!

1302
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,200
Yes! Confirmed gay!

1303
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:37,680
Someone tells some rubbish
And how am I to blame?

1304
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,440
That gay business was all for fun

1305
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,560
What's fun, Gautam?

1306
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,680
My dad wants us to score
10/10 in compatibility

1307
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:44,600
And the very 1st point
should go for a toss?!

1308
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:47,560
If someone calls you 'gay'
for fun how can you keep quiet?

1309
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,480
Look what a mess it has got us into

1310
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:51,160
I was put in such a spot

1311
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,240
You don't seem to understand my problem

1312
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,440
Oh! Your problem?

1313
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:58,280
This is the difference between you and me?

1314
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,240
I think of this problem as 'ours'

1315
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,840
You differentiate it as 'my problem'

1316
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,920
No point in us being married if
you can't think of 'my' as 'ours'

1317
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,520
I am sorry, Kavya

1318
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,880
This is not going to work out

1319
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,880
Really?

1320
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,680
What?

1321
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:26,000
Are you 'one of them'?

1322
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,680
What is that look for? I'm not that kind

1323
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:33,120
Neither am I My bad time

1324
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:36,920
Nithya's joke to her
uncle boomeranged on me

1325
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,840
You better keep your distance

1326
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:41,560
I'll shoot you otherwise

1327
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,160
Stop the vehicle

1328
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,280
I cannot

1329
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:45,720
- Stop it
- Why?

1330
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,400
I need to step out, urgent

1331
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:50,960
Why is it never ordinary for anyone
in the world... always 'urgent'?!

1332
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,400
Really urgent Stop, man

1333
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,680
- I won't stop
- Then I will jump out

1334
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:59,080
Stop... stop...
stop I can't hold on... I just can't

1335
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,720
- Get down
- Untie me

1336
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:05,040
Don't think you can
escape This gun is loaded

1337
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:08,080
I'll shoot you... beware!

1338
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:11,480
Tsk... tsk

1339
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:13,000
What?

1340
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,200
Take it off

1341
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:18,160
Crap! I can't be unzipping you

1342
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:21,240
Untie me for God's sake

1343
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:23,080
Come here

1344
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:30,720
Don't tsk-tsk me Say it loudly

1345
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,000
Stupid fellow

1346
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,920
Don't dilly dally Empty it fast

1347
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:39,440
Driver, stop the car

1348
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,840
Excuse me, sir,
is there any short cut to Tirupati?

1349
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:43,760
Go straight

1350
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,040
Take the next right which is a mud road

1351
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:49,040
- You'll land up in Tirupati
- Thank you, sir

1352
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:50,960
Getting married in Tirupati?

1353
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,640
Love marriage?

1354
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:54,280
- Yes, sir
- I like it

1355
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,160
All the best

1356
01:35:58,040 --> 01:35:59,960
How long will you pee?

1357
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,120
- I'm coming
- Come fast

1358
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,480
I think you have forgotten something

1359
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,720
Achacho! What did I forget?

1360
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,440
No need

1361
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,760
You trust me now?

1362
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:17,680
Not you... this gun

1363
01:36:18,586 --> 01:36:20,920
So 'Kavya matter' took a turn for the worse

1364
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,800
What is the next scene?

1365
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:25,080
Carry on

1366
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,520
Hello...?

1367
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:36,240
Sorry, Mr Gautam

1368
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:40,400
Your mother suffered a massive heart attack

1369
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:45,240
She did not survive even till the hospital

1370
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:47,960
We could not do anything

1371
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:49,040
I am sorry

1372
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:58,840
"I'm in search of a world new Let me go,
don't pursue"

1373
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:07,680
"Dissolved memories on my lashes'
tip Don't follow me, my son, let me slip"

1374
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:17,120
"A bud that bloomed in my womb dearly
I leave behind in my lonely journey"

1375
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:27,680
"I want to start my life afresh
Somewhere in the distance I'll refresh"

1376
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:36,520
"I'm in search of a whole new world
Don't follow, your steps with-hold"

1377
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:47,640
"Dissolved memories on my lashes'
tip Don't follow me, my child, let me slip"

1378
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:10,880
"Your scribbles while I nursed
You made them blessings instead"

1379
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:16,440
"Seated on my shoulder
you made me feel taller"

1380
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:21,880
"Your eyes are the best ever
No one can match or compare"

1381
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:27,480
"Alcove of your eyes tear-filled
Where did I go, leaving you stifled?"

1382
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:32,960
"Right next to God I'll be
protecting you diligently"

1383
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:41,240
"I'm leaving to another place
Life without me you have to face"

1384
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:54,000
"A whole new world I'm stepping into Son,
let go, I'll watch over you"

1385
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:09,480
Nithya, listen to me

1386
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:12,160
Nithya, where are you going?

1387
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:14,520
Will you tell me or not?

1388
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,600
At least you ask her

1389
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:19,040
Dad, I am going to Chennai

1390
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,160
Nithya...?

1391
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:23,240
NITHYA...!

1392
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:31,840
Hi

1393
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:44,240
I reached Chennai only yesterday
I came to know about aunt's demise

1394
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:46,000
I am really sorry

1395
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,040
- How are you?
- I am fine

1396
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,200
You?

1397
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:56,480
Sorry, Gautam I couldn't convince them

1398
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:59,440
My relatives also opposed strongly

1399
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:00,920
Why rake all that now?

1400
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,480
My parents had made their
own plans for my marriage

1401
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:07,040
They used our tiff as a convenient excuse

1402
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:09,800
And they decided without asking me

1403
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:14,040
I wanted to tell you after my marriage

1404
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:16,680
Are you happy now or not?

1405
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,360
That's what matters

1406
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:21,480
Thanks, Gautam

1407
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,440
We first met as friends

1408
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:26,840
So our friendship should
continue like this always

1409
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,520
Sure, Kavya

1410
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,480
Coffee?

1411
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,360
You'll make the coffee?

1412
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:36,320
No, thanks I'll make it myself

1413
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:37,280
Okay

1414
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:39,000
Kitchen is that way

1415
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:41,120
Okay... okay, you go and freshen up

1416
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:43,589
A superb cup of coffee
will be ready for you

1417
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:48,400
Hi Chocolate How are you?

1418
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,760
You,
me and Gautam will live happily together

1419
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:55,040
Okay... happy?

1420
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,160
Yes...?

1421
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:16,840
Sorry Wrong address

1422
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,560
It's okay

1423
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:53,160
Why ask her opinion?
We'll do as you suggested

1424
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:56,160
Very happy to hear you
say so, we also agree

1425
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,920
Look, Nithya is here

1426
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:05,680
Doesn't she look prettier face to face?

1427
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,320
Ravi uncle Anu aunty

1428
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:09,600
Hello uncle Hello aunty

1429
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:11,120
Come and sit with us

1430
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,280
This is our son's photo

1431
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:19,520
If you agree we will take
you with us right now

1432
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:21,920
Your parents can come as
guests to the wedding!

1433
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,960
- Take a look
- Not necessary, aunty

1434
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,360
My parents' decision is good enough for me

1435
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:32,520
In my life they will never
make a wrong decision for me

1436
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:36,600
I'll see you later

1437
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:44,040
Imagine,
finding such a girl in these modern times!

1438
01:42:56,480 --> 01:43:01,680
Nithya, you seem to be very happy

1439
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:06,920
What's the problem?

1440
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,960
Did you meet Gautam?

1441
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:18,240
What happened?

1442
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:24,000
Gautam is married now

1443
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:35,680
Chocolate

1444
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:38,960
What are you fiddling with?

1445
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:41,360
You've started eating books now

1446
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:42,880
Whose diary?

1447
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:48,800
'Gautam,
I thought we shared just a good friendship'

1448
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:52,600
'Only after talking to
Raja I realized I love you'

1449
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:55,480
'Only when I came to express my
love to you, I found out...'

1450
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:57,480
'...you are in love with Kavya'

1451
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:59,920
'But still, I love you'

1452
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:07,600
Hello? Can I speak to Nithya?

1453
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,560
She has gone out

1454
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:10,760
Where has she gone?

1455
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,480
She is getting married tomorrow morning

1456
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:14,800
Shucks!

1457
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:26,000
Not just run of the mill and ordinary
Extra-ordinary twists in your life, I say!

1458
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:28,080
How did you take all this in your stride?

1459
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:31,400
At least now understand I
must stop that wedding somehow

1460
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:32,920
Otherwise my life is ruined

1461
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,360
Your life... big deal!

1462
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,400
First she will fall for you

1463
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,280
Then she'll get engaged to Raja

1464
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:41,240
Today she will marry a totally new Mr X

1465
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:43,360
And you claim she is your life!

1466
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,680
Stupid... stoopid fellows

1467
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:49,880
One more word from you maligning Nithya...!

1468
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:51,920
Oh-o! Emotion, huh?

1469
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:55,480
Don't show your macho image
there But threaten me here!

1470
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:58,120
What will you do if I talk ill of Nithya?

1471
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:40,640
Hey! Where... where are you?

1472
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:46,880
Where is my gun?

1473
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:48,800
Hello...!

1474
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,560
I made a mistake

1475
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,320
I should have killed you
right in the beginning

1476
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:01,080
It's not too late now

1477
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:03,720
Anyone can shoot this gun
Shall I pull the trigger?

1478
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:05,280
Hey... hey!

1479
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:08,720
I know you are a scoundrel
K.Bal warned me on day one

1480
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:10,720
Who is K.Bal?

1481
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:14,840
As if you don't know him One
who asked me to kidnap you

1482
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:16,520
Nithya's father

1483
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:19,640
Yov! Nitya's father is Narayanan

1484
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:23,120
Not K.Bal?

1485
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:25,160
Not any bloody ball!

1486
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:29,400
Didn't you plan to elope
with K.Bal's daughter?

1487
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:31,440
No... no... NO

1488
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:34,040
Idiot... stupid... stupid

1489
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:38,320
Then who is he?

1490
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:45,080
Relax, sonny

1491
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:48,680
This seems to be XXL twist!

1492
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:51,680
Somehow I seem to have
kidnapped the wrong boy!

1493
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:55,760
I've never made such a silly mistake
in my 15 years of kidnapping service!

1494
01:46:55,800 --> 01:47:00,800
Service...
do you possess a doctorate in kidnapping?

1495
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:03,080
If you are not 'him' then who are you?

1496
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:04,360
Gautam

1497
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:13,800
Relax, Chucky You bungled somewhere

1498
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:19,400
I am Varthi Chakravarthi

1499
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:21,080
You are not worthy of even a name!

1500
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:23,600
You don't even know to kidnap properly

1501
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:24,720
What can I do?

1502
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:29,000
If boys like you fall in love girls'
fathers assign me to kidnap

1503
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,760
How many can I kidnap?

1504
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:34,120
Do you have any clue of
the work hazards in this?

1505
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:39,800
You refuse to sympathize with my plight...
stoopid!

1506
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:42,480
Wonder how it got goofed up

1507
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:45,920
Why were you standing near that car 1111?

1508
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,920
Where did I go wrong?

1509
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:54,320
What the hell did you do?

1510
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,320
It's smoking like a 'tandoori' stove

1511
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:58,160
Glutton! You can only think of food

1512
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:00,840
- How long will it take?
- Don't know

1513
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:04,760
Stop... stop... stop

1514
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,000
Who is he?

1515
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:07,920
Sir, I have to go to Hyderabad urgently

1516
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:09,720
Emergency, sir Can you drop me?

1517
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,240
- Get in
- Thank you, sir

1518
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,000
I'll go in this car Follow me quickly

1519
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:14,560
Don't worry, you go We'll catch up

1520
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:15,720
Okay, sir

1521
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:25,240
Driver, you also get down

1522
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,520
Bro, 2 tea please

1523
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:31,160
Okay, sir

1524
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:44,800
Saw the car and the target
Consider your job done

1525
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:19,080
- Aiyo...!
- Now what?

1526
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:22,480
If K.Bal knows I kidnapped
the wrong chap...

1527
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,280
...I won't get the money
and he will kill me for sure

1528
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:30,080
If Nithya gets married I'll kill you myself

1529
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:33,480
Wait... wait My phone is ringing

1530
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:36,000
Boss

1531
01:49:36,475 --> 01:49:38,920
- Hello, who is this?
- Who the hell are you?

1532
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:42,120
- What does it matter who I am?
- What do I care who you are?

1533
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:44,600
Where the hell have you
kidnapped my daughter to?

1534
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:46,160
Don't raise your voice

1535
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:50,640
If I don't get my Nithya
you'll also be a corpse

1536
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:52,840
Who is Nithya? Where is Chakravarthi?

1537
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:57,760
I killed him long ago
Shut your gob and phone

1538
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:02,480
Why did you say you have killed me?

1539
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:07,720
If I tell him you are here, he'll send
50 of his thugs to kill you right now

1540
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,720
Super, my dear groom

1541
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,640
Hey! Who the heck is your groom?

1542
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:14,320
I meant bridegroom!

1543
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:17,200
You got into this mess all because of me

1544
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:23,600
I have to set it alright for
you Only you will marry Nithya

1545
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:27,400
Yes... hey... hey... hello

1546
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:31,240
Stop... stop Oh okay! Right... right

1547
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:40,800
Auspicious time is nearing

1548
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:43,400
Bring all the items for the wedding ritual

1549
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:50,760
What happened?

1550
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:53,080
What if Nithya is married before we reach?

1551
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:55,080
Sometimes such things happen

1552
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:57,240
What did you say? How dare you!

1553
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,920
Cool... cool... cool

1554
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:00,120
Madcap

1555
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:01,320
Who is the madcap?

1556
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:04,600
I am the madcap, I say something stupid,
shove my feet into my mouth!

1557
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:06,480
I'll shove the gun in

1558
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,920
We shouldn't be like guests eat sweet,
savory and go

1559
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:11,400
See some unsavory character
you must scare them away

1560
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:13,160
Trying to scare me?!

1561
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:16,200
Sir, why so many henchmen in a wedding?

1562
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:19,560
Who was killed last week in Vijayawada?

1563
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:20,560
Bhima Rao

1564
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:24,680
The groom is very close to him
That's why all this security

1565
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:29,800
Idiot! Where is this Gautam?
He left hours before we did

1566
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,360
Where is Gautam?

1567
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:33,200
Here I am, Gautam

1568
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:35,160
- Who is he?
- Software engineer

1569
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:38,080
Lost my job in the recession

1570
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:41,720
Please, 1 job Any job is okay

1571
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:44,120
You go inside and do your job

1572
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:46,840
How do we get hounded by all these losers!

1573
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:50,240
- Bro... oh... you!
- Bad penny back again

1574
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:53,320
If I go inside,
everyone is calling me a drunk

1575
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:54,800
They are avoiding me

1576
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:58,160
Do you expect them to treat you like a VIP?

1577
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:01,880
Get me a VIP job then

1578
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:04,480
- Please, bro
- Get lost

1579
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:07,280
How do they make a beeline only to us?

1580
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:13,080
Before Gautam gets here
shall we kidnap the bride?

1581
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:16,640
Kidnap the brid-

1582
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:18,520

- Ouch!!

01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:31,920
What if he blabbers about the kidnapping?

1587
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:34,600
Who'll take a drunkard's
gibberish seriously?

1588
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:36,760
Let's go in and see what's up

1589
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:39,680
- Why are you so serious?
- She's so beautiful

1590
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,440
Can't you be a little shy?

1591
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:42,520
Shut up!

1592
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:45,880
Don't yell at me Give me some respect

1593
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:49,680
There are 112 criminal cases
pending against me you know

1594
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:53,120
Did you bungle all of them like this?

1595
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:54,800
Jump the gun case!

1596
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:59,200
By just hearing my name you know
they will pee in their pants

1597
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:01,800
Like how you trembled at the name of K.Bal

1598
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:04,040
I'll make you toothless Brag pot!

1599
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:08,160
You are degrading me way too much, dude

1600
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:10,560
If you open your mouth...!

1601
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:16,920
Cool, Chucky... cool

1602
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:26,400
"For 100 years and more
this couple should live"

1603
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:31,240
So you are the bridegroom?

1604
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:34,840
I swear you won't get married

1605
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:38,080
- You won't get married
- Uncle, what is he saying?

1606
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:41,200
Will you stop the wedding
because you didn't like the food?

1607
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:42,920
You are dead today

1608
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:46,840
He's getting beaten for deriding the food

1609
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:49,400
If they know we intend kidnapping the brid-

1610
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:51,680
Looks like a King Kong gang

1611
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:54,080
Who are you? Bride's side or groom's side

1612
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:55,320
- Groom's side
- Bride...!

1613
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:57,080
What does it matter whose side, sir?

1614
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:58,440
It's the wedding that matters

1615
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:00,360
We know all that Where are you from?

1616
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:01,760
- Chennai
- Bangalore

1617
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:03,720
What does it matter which city, sir?

1618
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:05,960
It's the wedding that matters

1619
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,560
- Uncle
- Yov!

1620
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:10,880
Sir,
can I meet Nithya for just a few minutes?

1621
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:14,000
No boys allowed when
the bride is dressing up

1622
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:15,480
She's a GIRL!

1623
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:18,680
You are passing off
Saet's son as a daughter?!

1624
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:20,080
I am a girl

1625
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:21,560
Look, she can even feel shy!

1626
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:22,680
So she is a girl

1627
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:24,640
Your bob cut fooled me

1628
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:27,040
Boy-girl, only you can go in

1629
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:29,040
My slipper will talk!

1630
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:30,760
Before that I'll hit you

1631
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:31,920
Who is this joker?

1632
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,760
Knife and rope are ready

1633
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:37,040
I've also fixed a dark room
like you see in Mysskin's films

1634
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:39,720
Next step is kidnap Proceed, my boys

1635
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:45,160
- Where's the liquor carton?
- In the Tasmac shop

1636
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:48,120
- Who is that big-mouth?
- I don't know

1637
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:49,560
Ouch!

1638
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Are you playing games with my life?

1639
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:54,960
'I love you I'm not married'

1640
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,640
Gautam should have told me this, right?

1641
01:54:58,160 --> 01:54:59,320
Stupid!

1642
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:04,160
I've agreed to this wedding my parents
arranged and I'm decked up like this

1643
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:06,360
Are you asking me to jump?

1644
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,240
I will kill all of you

1645
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:11,960
What shall we do now?

1646
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:34,240
Gautam isn't married as yet, dad

1647
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:39,760
Pinky told me just now

1648
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:42,200
Pinky... Pinky?

1649
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:50,880
In some confusion... I tho-

1650
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:53,360
I thought he was married

1651
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:54,880
Sorry

1652
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:58,840
Can I go, dad?

1653
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:00,960
Please

1654
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:10,600
- Go
- Thanks, dad

1655
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:18,760
Is the wedding over?

1656
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:20,360
Not yet

1657
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:24,360
You saved your skin... go

1658
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:29,080
- Hey! Gautam
- Now what?

1659
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:31,040
My gun

1660
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,680
I'll give you

1661
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:37,720
Next time bring a photo
before you kidnap anyone

1662
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:40,360
Don't get fooled by a number plate, madcap

1663
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:41,520
Shut up, madcap

1664
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:43,320
Hey... hey

1665
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:47,440
By the way, remember you wished a
man for his wedding in Tirupati?

1666
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:49,880
He is the one you should
have actually kidnapped!

1667
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:51,160
K.Bal's son-in-law

1668
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:53,440
You and your Chucky bragging!

1669
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:57,280
'Getting married in Tirupati?'
'Love marriage?'

1670
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:59,000
'- Yes, sir' '- I like it'

1671
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:00,880
'All the best'

1672
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,240
Stupid... stupid... stupid

1673
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:07,480
This is the height of stoopidity!

1674
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:29,560
Young man...? This way

1675
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:38,080
Where is the bride's room, little one?

1676
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:39,640
Upstairs

1677
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:47,200
Oh... lady's sari

1678
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:51,240
Oh! Sorry Window sari

1679
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:53,040
Kidnap started

1680
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:54,400
Okay

1681
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:04,760
Nithya... Nithya

1682
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:18,680
Bring the bride

1683
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:23,360
Nithya, open the door

1684
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:25,000
What does your father do?

1685
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:26,040
Farming, sir

1686
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:27,480
That means fishing!

1687
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:29,680
Looks like his father is one of us

1688
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:31,600
- Nithya jump
- Nithya jump...?

1689
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:33,240
Oh gawd!

1690
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:35,800
What is she telling you?

1691
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:38,960
Listen... Nithya is not opening the door

1692
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,200
Bride is missing...? Let's go and check

1693
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:44,040
Hold on to these hooligans

1694
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:47,760
Nithya...?

1695
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:50,080
Move aside

1696
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:52,320
Nithya madam Open the door

1697
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:56,600
If they can bang on the door so hard
I can't imagine what they'll do to me!

1698
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:59,320
Hello, friend Please... excuse me

1699
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:01,800
If you let go, I'll fall

1700
01:59:03,320 --> 01:59:05,440
Has the bride been kidnapped so fast?

1701
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:06,680
Kidnapped?

1702
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:08,640
You are in the dark?

1703
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:12,520
Bride's friends from Chennai
have come to kidnap her

1704
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:15,360
Oh! They are knocking at the door

1705
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:19,240
NO! Don't open the door

1706
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:21,760
Who are you?

1707
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,200
Where is the bride?

1708
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:24,320
1 minute

1709
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:26,400
Drunken dog!

1710
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:29,480
Kidnaaaaap

1711
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:34,720
Why don't you listen to me, Chitra?
I don't have the money right now

1712
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:37,360
My plan got screwed up

1713
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:41,360
I'll re-plan and get loads of money for you

1714
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:45,520
Didn't you promise to take
me to Kalyan jewellers?

1715
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:47,960
- I agree I said so
- What happened now?

1716
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,600
Uncle, is this your car?

1717
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:52,440
If I talk about jewelry-

1718
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:55,360
Will you drop me in Chennai, please?

1719
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:57,280
'Will you take me or not?'

1720
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:58,280
'If so when?'

1721
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:00,800
'Don't give excuses like a broken record'

1722
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:04,960
My dear wifey,
I'll myself buy jewelry for you from Kalyan

1723
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:07,600

1724

1727
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:15,760
Thank you, uncle

1728
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:22,480
- Where is the girl?
- Tell us

1729
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:25,080
How many times to ask?

1730
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:28,160
- Where is the bride?
- Tell us now

1731
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:30,000
ONE MINUTE!

Speak one at a time

1733
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:33,160
Clarity

1734
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:35,360
Is this a dubbing theater
to voice-check for clarity!

1735
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:36,840
Are you a sound engineer?

1736
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:37,960
No, art department

1737
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,600
Sir, I'm a software engineer Don't touch me

1738
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:42,520
Who the hell are you? What are your names?

1739
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:43,400
Gautam

1740
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:44,520
What is your name?

1741
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:45,280
Gautam

1742
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:47,360
Why are you repeating his name?

1743
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:48,720
My name is also Gautam

1744
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:50,080
Lift and see

1745
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:52,800
Not down under! Stomach... ID card

02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,520
Unbelievable He's also Gautam!

1747
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:57,560
- Nice name, no?
- Beauty...!

1748
02:00:57,640 --> 02:01:00,360
Tell us the truth now Where is the bride?

1749
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:02,480
Sir, actually this is not a kidnap case

1750
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:03,520
One minute

1751
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:05,640
This kidnapping is perfectly planned

1752
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:10,880
Once committed I won't betray my job

1753
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:13,160
- What work?
- Don't know

1754
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:15,840
This won't work Call the police

1755
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:18,760
Yes, call him Inspector Duraisngam

1756
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:21,080
9704228252

1757
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:23,120
He knows the Inspector it seems

1758
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,600
Of course I do

1759
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:27,120
Not just me Everyone knows him

1760
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:29,160
Actor Sivakumar's son

1761
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:30,760
Suriya who acted in 'Singam'

1762
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:33,560
"Singam... Lion king... Gautam"

1763
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:37,720
I have no connection with him or the kidnap

1764
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:39,840
No connection?

1765
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:43,200
Yov! Moustache Come here

1766
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:49,240
Question 1,
did you invite both of us for the wedding?

1767
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:50,520
No

1768
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:54,720
Question 2, why was he in the bride's room?

1769
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:56,360
Question 3...!

1770
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:58,840
Hey!
Do I have to ask all the questions myself?

1771
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:01,800
Why don't you take over?
Am I not right, friend?

1772
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:03,720
- Pooh!
- Thank you very much

1773
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:05,320
How many of you are involved?

1774
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:08,000
Total 6 including me

1775
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:09,280
6 of you?

1776
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:10,960
Where are the other 4?

1777
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:14,160
1-2-3-4-right or wron-

1778
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:17,040
Hey! Are you guys here?

1779
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:19,960
- Caught red handed!
- Who kidnapped the bride then?

1780
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:21,360
They are the kidnappers

1781
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:24,560
Brothers and single sister Plan success

1782
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:28,000
Don't spare anyone Tie them also

1783
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:37,720
Hey girl! Take off your jewels

1784
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:42,040
Please drop me in Chennai After
that you can take all this

1785
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:44,640
Take off your jewels right
now I'll drop you right here

1786
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:47,400
Remove, right now

1787
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:54,000
Don't cry

1788
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:02,520
It's always like this

1789
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:07,200
Whenever I want to see Gautam
a problem will crop up always

1790
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:08,680
Gautam...?!

1791
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:13,320
He won't know to tell Nor
will I be able to tell

1792
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:19,440
1st time I went to express my
love Kavya's photo came between us

1793
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:20,440
Kavya?

1794
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:25,240
2nd time Kavya was in his house with the
wedding chain flashing round her neck

1795
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:28,000
What was I supposed to think?

1796
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:35,440
Fine, I'm destined to be jinxed

1797
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:38,080
Kill me

1798
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:41,120
But after that kill Gautam

1799
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:43,200
Gautam... Kavya?

1800
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:47,320
What will he do without me, poor fellow?

1801
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:48,760
Nithya...?

1802
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:54,040
How do you know my name?

1803
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:57,520
Nithya... Gautam... Kavya?

1804
02:03:57,680 --> 02:04:01,360
Kavya... Gautam... Nithya!

1805
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:05,520
Who are you?

1806
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:10,560
"Southern realm of the Pandya clan
Chariots grace the roads with elan"

1807
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:12,000
I'm your BIG brother

1808
02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:15,600
"He came like a sprightly deer
Who could have hit him, I wonder?"

1809
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:17,480
- Tell us
- Right Now

1810
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:19,240
1 MINUTE

1811
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:21,280
All of us are caught now, right?

1812
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:22,560
What are you waiting for?

1813
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:24,600
Pounce, pummel and punch

1814
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:34,080
Who the hell is she?

1815
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:46,440
Nithya... listen to me, please

1816
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:50,640
Nithya, don't shoot

1817
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:54,280
Baby,
if you return my gun I can leave right now?

1818
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:56,040
Okay... okay, your wish

1819
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:58,440
- Shut up
- Take your own sweet time

1820
02:04:58,640 --> 02:05:00,880
You know what I'm thinking

1821
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:02,080
Tell me

1822
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:04,480
Let me... let me tell you

1823
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:05,760
Don't mumble

1824
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:09,320
1st time actually I thought

1825
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:10,320
You-

1826
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:13,200
- Blurt it out, boy
- Allow me to tell, man

1827
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:17,760
I thought I'll tell you
in the railway station

1828
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:20,080
But Raja messed it up big time

1829
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:23,040
Later with Kavya I agree I made a mistake

1830
02:05:23,080 --> 02:05:26,640
You never shared that episode of your
'miss-take' with Kavya?!

1831
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:29,840
Keep quiet, man This man is a pain

1832
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:31,840
What I'm trying to say is

1833
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:34,920
It was my mistake to think
I was in love with Kavya

1834
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,560
You won't be clear about all this

1835
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:39,640
Phone... phone

1836
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,560
Excuse me, please

1837
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:45,360
Chitra, you have a knack of
calling me at the wrong time

1838
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:47,880
My friends derided you

1839
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:51,400
They said you weren't good looking

1840
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:54,280
Their opinion Not my feelings

1841
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:56,120
In my eyes you are-

1842
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:58,680
Donkey! Why did I marry you?

1843
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:02,040
1st kill that fellow
'Pain in the wrong place'

1844
02:06:02,080 --> 02:06:06,200
Sorry, my wifey I'll speak softly

1845
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:08,040
You go ahead

1846
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:11,400
- Tell me now
- I will

1847
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:15,640
I will but I can't say it like
in the movies scene by scene

1848
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:19,440
When I first met you I
didn't have any feelings

1849
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:24,120
When I missed Kavya and Simran
I thought I was the problem

1850
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:26,040
But I realize now...

1851
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:28,000
...I didn't love them at all

1852
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:29,800
I imagined it

1853
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:32,640
Gawd! How do I explain it to you?

1854
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:36,680
When I see you talking to any
guy I burn with anger inside

1855
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:40,840
I feel like impressing you
with whatever lies possible

1856
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:45,200
When you wear short dresses I
feel like giving you 1 tight slap

1857
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:49,000
Imagine I went to the extent
of stopping your wedding

1858
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:52,120
I had no clue I could be
so jealous and possessive

1859
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:54,560
Until I met you

1860
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:57,280
This is love for sure

1861
02:06:57,360 --> 02:06:59,160
Confirmed

1862
02:06:59,640 --> 02:07:01,360
Forget all this

1863
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:04,600
I am crazy about you I
can't live without you

1864
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:07,680
That's the truth

1865
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:10,560
Call it what you want

1866
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:12,800
I'll take care of you well

1867
02:07:13,400 --> 02:07:15,440
I swear on my mom

1868
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:18,680
Chitra, you are just not listening to me

1869
02:07:18,760 --> 02:07:22,520
You are so stubborn Listen to me, please

1870
02:07:24,440 --> 02:07:27,880
Tell me those balance 3 words

1871
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:34,040
I...

1872
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:38,200
You...

1873
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:41,400
Shall we get married?

1874
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:44,560
You promised you'd change
our baby's diapers yourself

1875
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:46,480
How can I do all that crappy job?

1876
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:48,880
You utter one more word
I'll slice you to pieces

1877
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:49,880
Shut up Stupid

1878
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:51,960
What shall I do to him?

1879
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:53,600
Kill him

1880
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:58,200
Hey... hey... Nithya!

1881
02:07:59,640 --> 02:08:02,080
How could you tie me up!

1882
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:09,120
Uncle has brought us together Poor man,
let him go

1883
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:10,560
This madcap?

1884
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:13,200
If we untie him,
he'll kidnap some other wrong chap!

1885
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:15,600
Who is the nutcase? You are...!

1886
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:18,440
Go home,
dear man Your wife is waiting for you

1887
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:21,960
My wifey and I are very tight

1888
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:24,320
What do you know about us, stoopid?

1889
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:25,600
Who is stupid?

1890
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:27,160
Me... me only

1891
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:30,000
Okay, sing a song

1892
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:30,960
I cannot

1893
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:33,400
- No... I'll shoot you

1894
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:38,000
- Do what I say
- Please sing, uncle
