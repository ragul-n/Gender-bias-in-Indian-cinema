254
00:30:55,442 --> 00:30:57,245

256
00:31:01,247 --> 00:31:03,250

my own on my parents' name.

264
00:31:22,334 --> 00:31:23,301
Tell me now,

265
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:26,841
is it important to win Rs.50 lakhs
and make your dream come true,

266
00:31:26,904 --> 00:31:29,142
or that Rs.100 given by a girl?

267
00:31:30,574 --> 00:31:32,209
Don't misuse it.

00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:45,158
Rs.100 given by that girl is more
than the prize money of Rs.50 lakhs.

272
00:31:45,222 --> 00:31:46,324
What do you think ofyourself?

273
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:47,389
Everybody is equal here.

274
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,693
l can't make separate rules
and play a game for you.

275

Will you give Rs.100 or

276
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:54,063

You were living comfortably
with so many maidens there!

307

to forest in search of a home,

00:34:13,757 --> 00:34:19,601
Maidens mean girls who were with you
in shorts and playing around.

311

Why did you leave them?

312
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,267

Thank you, brother!

318
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:00,366
l've a doubt.

319
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:03,839
How can anyone fall in love
with a girl at first sight?

320
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,037
Why?

321
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:09,377
You go to see a girl as bride,
she serves you a coffee,- Yes.

322
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,477
with glass of coffee in hand
you look at her only once,

323
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,148

324
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,082
Trying to fool me.

325
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,317
Tell me, what are you planning to do?

00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,790
Take it, search for her.
Search!

328
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:28,129
1000's travel through this place,
she may be on a visit to Goa.

329
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:29,328
How can you find her?

330
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,994
My heart says...
- What?

331
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,868
She's here...

332
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,902
l'll search for her
where l first met her!

333
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:40,371

334
00:35:40,436 --> 00:35:43,007
l'm telling you
but still you're a fool.

335
00:35:43,071 --> 00:35:44,407
Why?
- Asking me why?

336
00:35:44,506 --> 00:35:46,944
Winning Rs.50 lakh prize money,

337
00:35:47,009 --> 00:35:49,012

338
00:35:49,077 --> 00:35:50,980
siRing in helicopter,

339
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:56,189
where are you my love?

340
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,756
You could search for her
from up there!

341
00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:03,826
Some unknown girl gave you Rs.100...

342
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:09,268
let anyone talk anything about
Rs.100 and that girl,

343
00:36:09,363 --> 00:36:11,365

Okay?
- Okay.

345
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:14,802
That 100 rupee is very
important to me.

346

Why?

347
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:26,781
Okay, there's truth in what you say!

348
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:29,416
Don't give up,
find wherever she may be.

349
00:36:29,482 --> 00:36:31,250
Your love must win, that's all.

350
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:34,789
Come to me for any help.
- l love you, brother.

351
00:37:11,218 --> 00:37:12,454
Yes!

352
00:37:13,855 --> 00:37:14,956
That's her!

353
00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:22,095
Thank you!

354
00:37:22,129 --> 00:37:23,264
Yeah!

355
00:37:32,072 --> 00:37:33,573
Public property!

356
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:37,046
After use, please flush it properly.

357
00:37:39,611 --> 00:37:41,281
Are you blind?
- Sorry sir.

358
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:42,549
Are you blind like me?

359
00:37:42,614 --> 00:37:44,484
Sorry sir...very sorry.

360
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:47,187
What sorry? Go carefully!

361
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,490
People with eyes behave like blind!

362
00:37:52,322 --> 00:37:57,299
Rs.5...one rupee...who gave it?

363
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:02,035
Rs.2...Rs5...
- Please move your leg, sir.

364
00:38:02,132 --> 00:38:04,335
Sorry sir...l'm blind, sir.

365
00:38:04,401 --> 00:38:06,738
Oh, is it you, sir?

366
00:38:06,804 --> 00:38:07,972
Sorry sir.

367
00:38:08,906 --> 00:38:10,275
Go...go...sir.

368
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:13,376
Are you blind like me?

369
00:38:14,811 --> 00:38:17,148
When he entered he had legs!

370
00:38:17,246 --> 00:38:18,615
Now no legs!

371
00:38:19,281 --> 00:38:23,022
Has a competitor come here
to hit my earning?

372
00:38:23,118 --> 00:38:25,388
l must be very careful.

373
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:28,659
l must keep an eye on him constantly.

374
00:38:42,836 --> 00:38:48,012
There's no life to me without you...

375
00:38:48,908 --> 00:38:51,847
Madam! It's me! You gave Rs.100
day before yesterday, right?

376
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,779
Do you remember it?

377
00:38:52,878 --> 00:38:57,954
Using that Rs.100 as investment,
l've started selling newspaper, madam.

378
00:38:58,017 --> 00:39:00,955
From today!
Be my first customer, madam.

379
00:39:15,298 --> 00:39:16,501
Thank you, madam.

380
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:35,120
Madam, l'll give the change.
- No thanks, keep that change.

381
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:41,558
Paper...paper...
anybody wants daily newspaper?

382
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:04,414
You're my life...

383
00:40:04,477 --> 00:40:07,383
Hey, go that side!
- Sorry, madam!

384
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:10,085
Brother...mother...please give me alms.

385
00:40:11,483 --> 00:40:13,688
Aren't you ashamed to beg
with good limbs?

386
00:40:13,752 --> 00:40:18,061
l'm blind sir.
- May be but limbs are fine, right?

387
00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:23,031
look at him, though he has no legs
he sells paper for living.

388
00:40:23,094 --> 00:40:24,865
learn from him.

389
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:26,432
Go, work to earn your livelihood.

390
00:40:26,497 --> 00:40:28,535
Here he comes.
- Okay, brother.

391
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:26,459
Madam, when l was a boy,
my parents died in a car accident.

392
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:32,960
Now l'm alone in this life.

393
00:41:33,025 --> 00:41:34,794
l don't have anyone.

394
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:54,049
May be l was fated...for Myna!

395
00:41:55,078 --> 00:41:58,920
Don't know why she started
liking me, sir.

396
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,353
We both became very good friends.

397
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:06,826
You're my every happiness...

398
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:09,795
You're poking the stick
as and where you wish.

399
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:11,829
Come, my dear Ramu!

400
00:42:11,894 --> 00:42:13,630
Please don't say like that, sir.

401
00:42:13,696 --> 00:42:15,299
How are you doing, brother?

402
00:42:15,363 --> 00:42:17,334
Are you doing fine, brother?
- l'm fine.

403
00:42:17,432 --> 00:42:19,435
l came for you.
- Are you fine?

404
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,706
What fine, brother? Forget it.

405
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,273
lt has become a big problem
in this train, brother.

406
00:42:24,338 --> 00:42:25,774
What's the problem?

407
00:42:25,873 --> 00:42:30,949
A young man though has legs
a_s like a lame,

408
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:33,416
it is affecting my business
a lot, brother.

409
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:37,086
Do something and ensure he
doesn't get into this train.

410
00:42:37,184 --> 00:42:40,289
l'll get you a brandy boRle every day.

411
00:42:40,353 --> 00:42:45,061
Forget about the bandy,
how do you know he has legs?

412
00:42:45,123 --> 00:42:46,427
l can see, brother.

413
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:49,030
l'm seeing his a_ every day
with my eyes, brother.

414
00:42:49,127 --> 00:42:50,330
Who?
- I!

415
00:42:50,396 --> 00:42:51,364
You?
- Yes?

416
00:42:51,464 --> 00:42:52,965
You're blind, aren't you?

417
00:42:56,368 --> 00:42:59,707
Though l'm blind,
l can see with my divine vision!

418
00:42:59,804 --> 00:43:01,207
God's gift, sir!

419
00:43:01,273 --> 00:43:05,380
See, l know where you were and
siRing right before you.

420
00:43:05,443 --> 00:43:06,544
lt's God's gift, sir.

421
00:43:06,577 --> 00:43:07,712
Divine vision?

422
00:43:10,514 --> 00:43:11,616
Brother!

423
00:43:12,515 --> 00:43:16,757
Boy from my Krishnagiri,
he makes lovely pu_ed rice.

424
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:21,293
Pu_ed rice...have it.

425
00:43:22,324 --> 00:43:26,131
Have it! Eat...eat...

426
00:43:26,495 --> 00:43:27,931
Very nice, sir.
- Eat!

427
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,468
Take it.

428
00:43:32,533 --> 00:43:34,838
No...
- Take it, l'm giving with love.

429
00:43:34,936 --> 00:43:36,505
Just now l had breakfast.

430
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:40,246
You may have had it in home,
this is special pu_ed rice.

431
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:42,178
No, brother.
- Have it.

432
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,512
No...no please...l'm not hungry!

433
00:43:44,577 --> 00:43:46,014
No brother...

434
00:43:54,821 --> 00:43:57,726
Madam, paper business is doing well.

435
00:43:59,393 --> 00:44:00,828
lt's all your grace.

436
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,804
Madam!

437
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:11,270
What's this?

438
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,343
Open it in home.

439
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:25,221
You're so friendly with
a physically challenged man,

440
00:44:25,316 --> 00:44:26,986
you're very good woman, madam.

441
00:44:27,051 --> 00:44:28,453
May God bless you!

442
00:44:28,553 --> 00:44:33,394
You gave up begging for work, right?
l like that aRitude.

443
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:35,660
Everyone must have this spirit.

444
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:41,236
l'm visiting temple today evening,
l want to offer prayers on your name.

445
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:46,874
Madam...can l ask your name please?

446
00:45:00,147 --> 00:45:01,416
Mynaa!

447
00:45:03,384 --> 00:45:06,523
Mynaa...thank you, madam.

448
00:45:08,154 --> 00:45:10,093
Thank you, madam...bye.

449
00:45:16,029 --> 00:45:18,566
Can l ask you something, madam?

450
00:45:19,399 --> 00:45:20,701
Go ahead.

451
00:45:21,634 --> 00:45:25,540
You'd look more beautiful with
a dot on forehead, madam.

452
00:45:27,772 --> 00:45:31,915
l forgot...thank you!

453
00:45:32,011 --> 00:45:33,379
Don't forget it from tomorrow.

454
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:29,799
How come your love so fast!

455
00:46:29,863 --> 00:46:33,269
ln just one day you asked her name
and got a gift from her too!

456
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:35,036
What did you say her name is?
- Mynaa.

457
00:46:35,101 --> 00:46:38,173
Mynaa! What a lovely name!

458
00:46:38,237 --> 00:46:40,475
You please open this.
- Should l?

459
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,045
The girl gave it you as gift,
how can l open it?

460
00:46:44,143 --> 00:46:46,413
You were the first man
to support my love, right?

461
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,784
First gift...so...
- You're too much boy!

462
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:52,153
God! May it be a boRle!

463
00:46:53,052 --> 00:46:53,918
Take it.

464
00:46:54,017 --> 00:46:55,320
Keep it on ears.

465
00:46:56,955 --> 00:46:58,824
What could it be?

466
00:47:09,566 --> 00:47:13,407
l saw many things but never seen
any gift like this.

467
00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:22,213
Girls are very clever now a days!

468
00:47:22,311 --> 00:47:25,416
They'll check in the balance to
see if he's worth or not.

469
00:47:25,513 --> 00:47:28,786
Then, decide what ought to give
and what ought not to give.

470
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,123
According to me she's very smart,
forget her.

471
00:47:34,221 --> 00:47:35,624
She's very good girl.

472
00:47:35,723 --> 00:47:36,991
You're a fool!

473
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:41,300
You don't have the status to love me,

474
00:47:41,362 --> 00:47:45,067
you're a poor man,
so gave this gift.

475
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:49,206
She says you're like a slipper.

476
00:47:49,836 --> 00:47:51,573
My close friends,

477
00:47:51,638 --> 00:47:55,778
from Sahajanand to Shahrukh Khan,
l've seen everyone's love,

478
00:47:55,841 --> 00:47:57,644
but nobody ever gave such a gift!

479
00:47:57,743 --> 00:47:58,544
Nobody!

480
00:47:58,611 --> 00:48:01,451
Hit...hit yourself with it,
l told you that day,

481
00:48:01,514 --> 00:48:05,387
what she's showing isn't love
but compassion for your handicap.

482
00:48:05,484 --> 00:48:06,518
Did you listen to me?

483
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:11,727
Pray to Goddess Ganga and
hit three times on your cheeks.

484
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,193
lf you've any self respect, take it.

485
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,928
Take it...hit yourself.

486
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:17,963
Hit yourself!

487
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:22,069
lf you've any self respect,
never again see her.

488
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:24,103
Hit yourself with it,
why are you siRing silently?

489
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:28,976
Hey fool...why are you seeing
as if God gave it to you?

490
00:48:40,316 --> 00:48:42,853
Why did you throw into water?

491
00:48:42,952 --> 00:48:45,288
You should hit yourselfthrice
and then threw it.

492
00:48:45,387 --> 00:48:47,357
She gave to hit you, right?

493
00:49:14,314 --> 00:49:16,817
Why are you running, you idiot?

494
00:49:17,382 --> 00:49:19,320
Hey stop boy!

495
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,622
You will die, man!

496
00:49:42,373 --> 00:49:44,376
Don't go further!

497
00:50:29,983 --> 00:50:30,850
What happened?

498
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:33,521
Brother, she didn't give it
for hiRing myself.

499
00:50:33,586 --> 00:50:34,421
Then?

500
00:50:34,487 --> 00:50:38,560
See this!
lord Madheshwara! How is it?

501
00:50:39,425 --> 00:50:42,664
Super! listen to me, sunny.

502
00:50:42,728 --> 00:50:51,478
Never anything thrown or humans
falling here have been found,

503
00:50:51,569 --> 00:50:56,411
but you got it back,
it means she really loves you!

504
00:50:56,939 --> 00:51:01,349
Run...run...run...don't leave her!

505
00:51:05,481 --> 00:51:09,188
lt has really helped me,
l like it, madam.

506
00:51:09,285 --> 00:51:13,126
Nobody must beg for being
physically challenged.

507
00:51:14,524 --> 00:51:19,733
You wanted to earn your livelihood
by working, l like that.

508
00:51:20,595 --> 00:51:23,635
l like you for that.
- Thank you.

509
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,605
Nobody must stay back saying
l don't have limbs,

510
00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:29,538
they must keep running
with wheels on legs, madam.

511
00:51:29,637 --> 00:51:31,941
Keep running all the life
without resting for a moment.

512
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:36,613
The concept of life l like
is life runs on wheels.

513
00:51:37,712 --> 00:51:40,616
life runs on wheels? That's nice.

514
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,083
Thank you.
Thank you, madam.

515
00:51:42,149 --> 00:51:43,885
Can l ask you a question?

516
00:51:43,983 --> 00:51:45,386
Go ahead.

517
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:49,492
Why do you always sit
in this seat only?

518
00:51:50,556 --> 00:51:55,265
l travel to my office everyday in
this train, l know most of them.

519
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:58,299
This seat is always reserved for me.

520
00:51:58,964 --> 00:52:01,803
Why did you ask me that?

521
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,305
Just out of curiosity, madam.

522
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:06,738
Just to know it.

523
00:52:07,972 --> 00:52:11,011
Colourful...

524
00:52:14,178 --> 00:52:16,782
Colourful...

525
00:52:18,014 --> 00:52:20,786
Colourful...

526
00:52:24,521 --> 00:52:28,294
My legs are paining,
l've to endure it.

527
00:52:29,725 --> 00:52:30,826
What happened?

528
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:37,805
Nothing, you're calling that
white falls as colourful!

529
00:52:37,867 --> 00:52:41,005
l was thinking why?

530
00:52:41,069 --> 00:52:44,509
These waterfalls is an
inspiration to our life.

531
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,346
Whenever l pass before falls,
l always shout  Colourful!

532
00:52:49,443 --> 00:52:52,482
l can't shout  "l love you"
before everyone, right?

533
00:52:54,882 --> 00:52:58,855
What's the connection between
"l love you" and "Colourful"?

534
00:53:02,322 --> 00:53:04,292
There is a connection.
- Is there?

535
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:08,699

536
00:53:09,694 --> 00:53:11,031

You're very smart.

553
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:07,205
Revathi is there, if l need
anything, l'll get it from her.

554
00:55:07,302 --> 00:55:08,471
Okay?

555
00:55:08,537 --> 00:55:09,940

Can l ask you a question, madam?

560
00:55:40,332 --> 00:55:42,437
Why do you always sit in this seat?

561
00:55:51,944 --> 00:55:53,814
Newspaper!

562
00:55:53,912 --> 00:55:55,614
Take it, brother!

563
00:55:55,714 --> 00:56:08,471
Show mery on this pitiful life,
lord Madheshwara!

564
00:56:08,926 --> 00:56:10,528
looks like she's very angry.

565
00:56:10,627 --> 00:56:12,932
God, please save me now.

566
00:56:14,865 --> 00:56:19,406
Who never makes mistakes?
Everyone makes mistakes!

567
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:25,881

573
00:57:07,613 --> 00:57:09,950
Never seen you so happy.

575
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:14,921

Colourful!

579
00:57:51,452 --> 00:57:53,557
Where's he? Are you here?

580
00:57:53,655 --> 00:58:01,904
What's this? You keep crying and
don't eat because she's angry.

00:58:01,962 --> 00:58:06,104
She's angry, right?
Just show up before her.

582
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:10,708
lf she really loves you,
she would be yearning to see you.

583
00:58:10,803 --> 00:58:13,141
She would laugh on seeing you.

584
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,109
love is like that!

585
00:58:15,175 --> 00:58:18,881
My friend built Taj Mahal
for his love.

586
00:58:18,944 --> 00:58:22,317
Had he been like you,
he wouldn't have built even a hut.

587
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:26,656
Keep on trying, sunny!
Victory is yours!

Hereafter l'll not say
colourful to you.

617
01:00:58,524 --> 01:01:00,694
Because l'm in love.

618

l'm really sorry!
Take your bag.

644
01:06:27,791 --> 01:06:31,831
Why did you fall down? Is it slippery?

Why did you lie to me?

That you don't have legs.

l loved you because you don't have legs.

650
01:06:55,684 --> 01:06:57,554
But you cheated me.

651
01:07:04,925 --> 01:07:08,932
Whatever l did was for your love!

652
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:12,335
l wanted to tell you the truth.

653
01:07:12,432 --> 01:07:15,203
l wanted to say sorry to you.

654
01:07:15,802 --> 01:07:24,318
But l didn't know l would lose

l lost my both legs due to polio.

662
01:09:02,332 --> 01:09:06,274
l hate you...l hate you...

663
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:29,037

01:11:29,134 --> 01:11:31,171
but you killed her, right?

665
01:11:49,218 --> 01:11:51,022
Do you still love me?

666
01:12:11,406 --> 01:12:12,574
Mynaa!

into the train at Castlerock station.

670
01:12:54,277 --> 01:12:56,048
My life has become yours!

671

l followed you further!

672
01:13:05,889 --> 01:13:10,898
l saw your friend picking you up
from Vasco station.

01:13:14,397 --> 01:13:16,099
lt was very painful.

674
01:13:17,065 --> 01:13:20,906
More than the pain my love for
you increased manifold.

675
01:13:21,737 --> 01:13:23,173
l decided then,

676
01:13:23,638 --> 01:13:29,015
my life and death is with you only!

677
01:13:34,581 --> 01:13:39,390
Do you love me despite knowing

679

Assist him.
- Okay sir.

702
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:36,281
Your love would've been
accepted by her family,

703
01:19:36,344 --> 01:19:38,717
and they would've got
you married, right?

704
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:41,786
l too thought her family would
happily agree to our marriage.

705
01:19:42,752 --> 01:19:44,689
But it didn't happen like that.

706
01:19:44,754 --> 01:19:45,989
Her elder brother,

707
01:19:46,088 --> 01:19:48,659
using her physically challenged status,

708
01:19:48,723 --> 01:19:52,163
taking all the govt. help for
physically handicapped people,

709
01:19:52,227 --> 01:19:54,966
taking loans from every bank
on her name,

710
01:19:55,063 --> 01:19:56,098
he was enjoying life!

711
01:19:56,163 --> 01:19:59,370
He didn't like me marrying her.

712
01:20:00,701 --> 01:20:04,910
So, we decided to marry
and run away to falls.

713
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:10,577
Greetings!

714
01:20:10,676 --> 01:20:12,748
My name is Diganth Doddamane.

715
01:20:12,846 --> 01:20:15,350
She's my wife Radhika Pandit.

716
01:20:15,415 --> 01:20:16,516
My life's heroine.

717
01:20:16,582 --> 01:20:18,787
There's only one difference
between you and me,

718
01:20:18,851 --> 01:20:23,226
you came carrying her,
l rolled her to my place!

719
01:20:23,322 --> 01:20:24,758
What happened to her legs?

720
01:20:24,824 --> 01:20:26,960
Did she get hurt while coming here?

721
01:20:27,025 --> 01:20:29,797
No, she lost her both
Iegs due to polio.

722
01:20:29,862 --> 01:20:30,996
Poor girl!

723
01:20:31,763 --> 01:20:35,002
Sentiments and emotions
don't work on me.

724
01:20:35,101 --> 01:20:37,237
l can accept if rent is
paid on time or late.

725
01:20:37,301 --> 01:20:40,374
But l need high advance.

726
01:20:40,438 --> 01:20:43,110
Hubby!
- No problem, sir.

727
01:20:43,207 --> 01:20:44,577
leave it.

728
01:20:44,675 --> 01:20:46,778
Take the keys, dear.

729
01:20:47,277 --> 01:20:49,614
Feel it is your home.

730
01:21:24,979 --> 01:21:33,594
The first rain of love fell
on my heart gently...

731
01:21:34,555 --> 01:21:43,137
My first dream of love came
true as you in my life...

732
01:21:44,865 --> 01:21:49,571
Sky touched the reaching out hand...

733
01:21:49,634 --> 01:21:54,342
Rainbow stuck on my body...

734
01:21:54,406 --> 01:22:04,158
New year and new life started now...

735
01:22:05,316 --> 01:22:14,566
The first rain of love fell
on my heart gently...

736
01:22:42,482 --> 01:23:00,516
Before you entered my life...
silence filled my life...

737
01:23:00,866 --> 01:23:10,918
When you came near me,
life reached dizzy heights..

738
01:23:10,975 --> 01:23:19,892
l closed and opened my eyes,
the world has changed...

739
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:30,770
New year and new life started now...

740
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:09,798
Actually l don't have both legs.

741
01:24:09,895 --> 01:24:12,768
l had polio since l was a child.

742
01:24:15,702 --> 01:24:16,904
l'm sorry Sathya.

743
01:24:17,003 --> 01:24:18,972
She'll be an asset to my company.
- Thank you, sir.

744
01:24:19,037 --> 01:24:20,640
She's very capable.

745
01:24:21,207 --> 01:24:22,976
But still l can't offer her a job.

746
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:25,981
Please sir, don't reject her, sir.

747
01:24:26,045 --> 01:24:28,415
She has high hopes of geRing a job.

748
01:24:28,513 --> 01:24:32,087
There's no lift in my office,
we're in the second floor.

749
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:35,723
She has to been on time
at 9.30 am in the morning.

750
01:24:35,786 --> 01:24:37,121
l'm helpless.

751
01:24:37,188 --> 01:24:38,389
Try elsewhere.

752
01:24:38,488 --> 01:24:39,590
Good luck.

753
01:24:39,622 --> 01:24:40,723
Good luck.

754
01:24:41,225 --> 01:24:44,364
Your office starts at 9.30 am, right?

755
01:24:44,427 --> 01:24:47,167
She'll be in your office by 9.25 am.

756
01:24:47,264 --> 01:24:49,800
Yes sir, l'll guaranty you, sir.

757
01:24:50,834 --> 01:24:52,904
lf it so, then it is fine.

758
01:24:53,636 --> 01:24:55,339
Okay, best wishes.
- Thank you, sir.

759
01:25:17,258 --> 01:25:19,294
9.25 am sir! My wife is in office!

760
01:25:39,044 --> 01:25:57,112
life is a happyjourney now,
the name of happiness is you...

761
01:25:57,395 --> 01:26:07,413
You put an end to my lonely life...
you ushered heaven into my life...

762
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:16,386
lfyou're with me,
this world is all mine...

763
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:26,831
New year and new life started now...

764
01:26:29,290 --> 01:26:30,892
Do you know the wish of my life?

765
01:26:31,591 --> 01:26:33,629
You must walk...run!

766
01:26:33,727 --> 01:26:37,000
We both must run in our small house.

767
01:26:37,064 --> 01:26:40,103
You must chase and catch me.

768
01:26:40,967 --> 01:26:42,069
Then?

769
01:26:43,136 --> 01:26:48,880
Then, recently l met a doctor
while dropping him at airport.

770
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:53,982
l told you about you.

771
01:26:54,713 --> 01:26:58,686
He said you can be beRer
with an operation in 6 months.

772
01:26:58,784 --> 01:27:01,588
Shall we meet him once?

773
01:27:01,653 --> 01:27:05,861
Sathya, l'm very happy now.

774
01:27:06,792 --> 01:27:13,504
lf l get back my legs after operation,
l'll become independent,

775
01:27:13,598 --> 01:27:17,137
if it happens,
l'll miss this happiness.

776
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:22,877
l want you to be with me always.

777
01:27:22,939 --> 01:27:26,846
Mynaa, please don't say no.

778
01:27:37,352 --> 01:27:38,586
Mynaa!

779
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:47,899
Mynaa! What happened now?

780
01:27:49,096 --> 01:27:56,611
You do so much for me, but you don't
get any happiness from me, right?

781
01:28:00,173 --> 01:28:03,512
l too have so many wishes
like any ordinary girl.

782
01:28:06,012 --> 01:28:10,587
But some unknown fear!

783
01:28:16,388 --> 01:28:19,459
There's only one happiness
l can give you.

784
01:28:21,226 --> 01:28:22,661
My womanhood only!

785
01:28:34,371 --> 01:28:35,674
Sathya.

786
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:37,876
Yes?

787
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:05,672
Mynaa, my biggest happiness in
this world is you smile!

788
01:29:09,003 --> 01:29:14,480
lfyou keep smiling,
l can do wonders!

789
01:29:18,177 --> 01:29:20,882
Colourful! All my life!

790
01:29:27,587 --> 01:29:29,257
let's consult the doctor.

791
01:29:46,904 --> 01:29:52,248
Sathya, Mynaa must work for
bigger company than mine.

792
01:29:52,309 --> 01:29:55,048
With that your future must
also turn big.

793
01:29:55,112 --> 01:29:56,147
That's my wish.

794
01:29:56,212 --> 01:29:57,782
l'm so grateful to you, sir.

795
01:29:57,848 --> 01:29:59,917
Meet Veersingh in Infosys.

796
01:30:00,116 --> 01:30:01,251
Sure sir.

797
01:30:02,619 --> 01:30:03,921
Good luck...good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

798
01:30:03,986 --> 01:30:04,987
Thank you, sir.

799
01:30:05,054 --> 01:30:06,456
My name is Mynaa...

800
01:30:35,415 --> 01:30:38,989
Mr. Sathya, it's very difficult
to treat polio.

801
01:30:39,053 --> 01:30:41,589
lnfact we can say impossible.

802
01:30:41,688 --> 01:30:43,825
But still l hope she'll
be alright.

803
01:30:43,889 --> 01:30:45,993
l want to know how she'll react
to the medicines.

804
01:30:46,092 --> 01:30:48,010
For that l need to do
a complete body check up.

805
01:30:53,732 --> 01:30:55,702
Mynaa, you don't have
to worry about it.

806
01:30:55,801 --> 01:30:57,203
lt'll be very simple.

807
01:30:57,268 --> 01:30:59,006
let's plan the complete
body check up next week.

808
01:30:59,104 --> 01:30:59,871
Okay, doctor.

809
01:30:59,936 --> 01:31:00,737
That's good.
- Thanks.

810
01:31:00,804 --> 01:31:03,075
See you after a week, Mynaa.
Bye..bye.

811
01:31:07,812 --> 01:31:11,184
l like this chair.
- l'll buy you one.

812
01:31:12,916 --> 01:31:14,151
let's go.

813
01:31:23,193 --> 01:31:25,830
l'll not come for complete
body check up.

814
01:31:27,129 --> 01:31:28,765
lt's very difficult for me.

815
01:31:28,831 --> 01:31:30,265
Don't say like that.

816
01:31:31,866 --> 01:31:34,371
There won't be any problem.

817
01:31:34,436 --> 01:31:39,379
lf we've to have a child,
you must first get back your legs.

818
01:31:40,541 --> 01:31:44,615
lmagine this, you..me..
and our child!

819
01:31:44,713 --> 01:31:47,417
SiRing right here in

Wow! How nice it would be!

Okay!

Oh no! l feel shy!

827
01:32:55,943 --> 01:33:00,051
Are you young girl to feel shy?
You're middle aged woman.

828
01:33:00,148 --> 01:33:03,586
Our tenant when e takes
his wife on ycle,

You too!

832
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:12,628
He rides the ycle carrying her.

01:33:20,333 --> 01:33:22,202
Okay?

To make this lovely evening

01:33:30,009 --> 01:33:33,414
life has become a musical melody..

837
01:33:37,948 --> 01:33:39,652
Colourful!

This is my hard earned money,
please don't misuse it.

845
01:35:01,324 --> 01:35:06,268
Rs.100 you gave that day,
l had kept it safely all these days.

846
01:35:09,966 --> 01:35:12,737
When l'm with you,
one who gave you the money,

847
01:35:14,069 --> 01:35:15,906
forget it!

848
01:35:15,971 --> 01:35:20,079
When he took away that 100 rupees, felt
like someone taking you away from me.

849
01:35:26,281 --> 01:35:27,382
Colourful!

850
01:35:33,821 --> 01:35:35,692

Do you know all this, Mynaa?

l taught you to walk
with crutches, right?

866
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:25,938
Why didn't you tell me this before?

867
01:36:26,002 --> 01:36:30,444
You were so happy teaching
me all that.

868
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:33,010
l too was very happy
watching you happy.

869
01:36:33,074 --> 01:36:34,344
That's why l didn't tell you.

870
01:36:34,410 --> 01:36:35,812
Always playful!

871
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:37,882
Okay Sathya, come closer.

872
01:36:37,947 --> 01:36:39,917
Come..come..

Yes.

880
01:37:53,949 --> 01:37:58,758
Mostly, you may get tired
to catch her.

881
01:38:14,935 --> 01:38:17,873
Colourful!

882
01:38:52,769 --> 01:38:59,149

May l keep a dot to ward off
evil eye on your feet..

891
01:40:09,607 --> 01:40:15,851
No one is like you..

892
01:40:15,945 --> 01:40:21,624
No one is more beautiful than you..

893
01:40:21,951 --> 01:40:25,089
You came into my life..

894
01:40:25,187 --> 01:40:28,393
You won over me slowly..

895

let's give a new world
full of love and affection..

896

There's no one for me..

You become my life partner..

903
01:41:42,057 --> 01:41:48,036
This is my wish for every
life hereafter..

904
01:41:48,363 --> 01:41:58,483
To make this wish come true,

Your eyes are so beautiful!

918
01:43:09,304 --> 01:43:11,073
You're everything to me!

919
01:43:13,074 --> 01:43:15,912
l'm uploading your nude
video on Youtube.

Please watch it now!

921
01:43:17,645 --> 01:43:18,748
Watch now!

01:43:19,748 --> 01:43:21,784
l love you very much.

923
01:43:57,849 --> 01:44:00,553
My dear daughter,
whatever the difficulty may be,

924
01:44:00,618 --> 01:44:02,855
always live with your husband only.

925
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:05,724
Never come to parents' home
with bad name.

926
01:44:17,466 --> 01:44:18,568
Hey!

927
01:44:24,473 --> 01:44:28,246
Sathya mustn't know about
this at any cost.

928
01:44:28,343 --> 01:44:31,082
lf he comes to know,
he would go to any length.

929
01:44:45,426 --> 01:44:46,661
Mynaa!

930
01:44:48,528 --> 01:44:50,265
l want to tell you something.

931
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:51,231
Tell me.

932
01:44:51,298 --> 01:44:56,073
We both must stay together
whatever difficulty we may face,

933
01:44:56,735 --> 01:44:58,506
we must be together, right?

934
01:44:58,571 --> 01:44:59,806
let's be together.

935
01:45:00,238 --> 01:45:08,856
Whatever the situation may be,
if not..let's die together.

936
01:45:14,787 --> 01:45:17,290
Jumping down from the falls!

937
01:45:29,098 --> 01:45:34,409
She watches that boy and girl
and tortures me.

938
01:45:34,471 --> 01:45:37,677
l must do something
and shut the door.

939
01:45:38,607 --> 01:45:46,289
They're newly married couple,
they would be romancing,

940
01:45:46,348 --> 01:45:51,790
if we keep the door open
they may feel embarrassed.

941
01:45:51,852 --> 01:45:52,688
lsn't it?

942
01:45:52,787 --> 01:45:57,228
lf we close the door and lock it.

943
01:45:57,290 --> 01:45:58,894
That will be fine.

944
01:45:58,959 --> 01:46:01,330
They'll get privay.

945
01:46:01,395 --> 01:46:04,969
That's beRer. l'll lock the door.

946
01:46:11,170 --> 01:46:13,875
Shall we go, Sathya?

947
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:15,242
Wait a minute, l'm coming.

948
01:46:16,808 --> 01:46:21,385
Mynaa, ifyou don't accept
my proposal in one hour,

949
01:46:21,447 --> 01:46:25,954
l've masked your face on Internet,
l'll unmask it.

950
01:46:26,050 --> 01:46:28,655
The whole world is going
to see your nudity.

951
01:46:40,764 --> 01:46:42,200
What did fell down?

952
01:46:42,299 --> 01:46:44,302
Oh phone!

953
01:46:44,401 --> 01:46:46,938
My dear's phone has broken
into pieces.

954
01:46:57,980 --> 01:46:59,883
Why are you crying?

955
01:47:01,384 --> 01:47:04,789
l can get it repaired in one hour,
it'll be new again.

956
01:47:04,852 --> 01:47:05,953
That is..

957
01:47:07,789 --> 01:47:09,926
ls it because it was my gift?

958
01:47:10,024 --> 01:47:12,062
When l'm with you,
one who gave the gift,

959
01:47:12,126 --> 01:47:13,595
why do you worry about the phone?

960
01:47:13,695 --> 01:47:15,531
l'll get it ready in one hour.

961
01:47:15,963 --> 01:47:18,568
Don't cry..don't cry, my dear!

962
01:47:18,665 --> 01:47:20,970
lfyou cry, l too feel like crying.

963
01:47:21,068 --> 01:47:22,971
Smile..smile..smile..

964
01:47:25,639 --> 01:47:26,906
Smile!

965
01:47:29,742 --> 01:47:32,114
You're sweet darling!
Just a minute!

966
01:47:32,178 --> 01:47:33,447
l'll come back.

967
01:48:56,788 --> 01:48:58,056
Your wife is beautiful.

968
01:49:12,836 --> 01:49:18,379
Mynaa! Were you going through the pain
all by yourself all these days?

969
01:49:20,110 --> 01:49:21,279
l'm sorry.

970
01:49:21,978 --> 01:49:23,782
And l'm always there with you.

971
01:49:33,622 --> 01:49:37,830
She mustn't know at any cost
that l know the truth.

972
01:49:37,893 --> 01:49:40,764
She may be devastated!

973
01:49:57,110 --> 01:49:59,514
Hey Mynaa! Have juice..juice!

974
01:50:12,091 --> 01:50:13,928
Why? Have some more.

975
01:50:13,993 --> 01:50:15,203
You like it very much, right?

976
01:50:15,228 --> 01:50:16,798
l don't want, Sathya..please..

977
01:50:16,863 --> 01:50:18,197
Please take it.

978
01:50:19,998 --> 01:50:22,035
No problem..no problem..

979
01:51:05,507 --> 01:51:08,178
My husband will not be there
at 11 am in the morning,

980
01:51:08,276 --> 01:51:09,444
please come home.

981
01:53:15,025 --> 01:53:19,466
Sir, my husband will not be
in home tomorrow morning,

982
01:53:19,529 --> 01:53:23,670
please come home, my Mynaa isn't
a wife to invite another man to home.

983
01:53:25,568 --> 01:53:28,739
To delete the video from Internet,

984
01:53:28,837 --> 01:53:31,274
and give me the original tapes,

985
01:53:31,339 --> 01:53:33,209
l called you here.

986
01:53:33,274 --> 01:53:36,013
You must help to remedy_
this wrong on society.

987
01:53:36,612 --> 01:53:39,248
lsn't it wrong to go
against society, sir?

988
01:53:43,951 --> 01:53:46,690
Mynaa is my life, sir.

989
01:53:49,188 --> 01:53:54,332
Sir, l've never touched
my wife till now.

990
01:53:54,428 --> 01:53:59,270
ln the fear that if she gets pregnant,
it may put her to more difficulties.

991
01:54:01,067 --> 01:54:04,573
How could you get such
thoughts for her?

992
01:54:08,039 --> 01:54:09,942
Sorry sir..sorry!

993
01:54:11,509 --> 01:54:15,216
l beg you sir, please remove
the video from internet.

994
01:54:16,582 --> 01:54:19,319
Please give me the original tape.

995
01:54:19,383 --> 01:54:20,685
l pray you, sir.

996
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:21,920
Please sir.

997
01:54:22,587 --> 01:54:23,755
Sir..

998
01:54:25,089 --> 01:54:26,392
Please sir!

999
01:54:27,557 --> 01:54:31,999
You sleep with your wife
every day, right?

1000
01:54:32,596 --> 01:54:34,265
l'll sleep with her for a day,
that's it.

1001
01:54:34,364 --> 01:54:36,669
Nothing will happen.
Small adjustment!

1002
01:54:56,951 --> 01:54:58,853
How dare you beat me!

1003
01:54:58,952 --> 01:55:00,756
l want your wife!

1004
01:55:00,821 --> 01:55:02,791
At any cost!

1005
01:55:03,056 --> 01:55:04,359
l want her!

1006
01:55:04,425 --> 01:55:05,961
l know how to get her!

1007
01:55:46,096 --> 01:55:49,902
l know sir, l've killed a man,

1008
01:55:49,966 --> 01:55:52,537
police would catch me in a day or two,

1009
01:55:52,635 --> 01:55:55,875
if by any chance l end up in jail,

1010
01:55:55,972 --> 01:56:00,981
my wife would be left alone
in this world,

1011
01:56:01,076 --> 01:56:03,781
it pained me a lot, sir,
so, l decided,

1012
01:56:03,845 --> 01:56:08,121
to get her operated and
make her stand on her own legs,

1013
01:56:08,918 --> 01:56:13,425
that night for the first time
l told a lie to my wife.

1014
01:56:15,923 --> 01:56:18,963
That l got transferred to Chennai.

1015
01:56:19,027 --> 01:56:22,632
My poor wife trusted
and supported me.

1016
01:56:22,696 --> 01:56:25,935
lfthey ask you to go,
you must go, right?

1017
01:56:28,802 --> 01:56:34,746
l too..don't like it.

1018
01:56:34,841 --> 01:56:36,109
l'm bored.

1019
01:56:36,843 --> 01:56:38,278
let's go away.

1020
01:56:38,377 --> 01:56:40,982
l'll also get transfer from my office.

1021
01:56:41,046 --> 01:56:43,450
lt'll be good for us,
l'm telling you.

1022
01:56:43,548 --> 01:56:45,184
lt's going to be fine.

1023
01:56:46,618 --> 01:56:49,956
We both left to Chennai overnight.

1024
01:56:59,130 --> 01:57:04,573
We met a doctor in Chennai
she too was a good person like y' ou.

1025
01:57:04,635 --> 01:57:05,903
A Kanndiga.

1026
01:57:06,003 --> 01:57:11,412
l too walked and ran and
played all other kids.

1027
01:57:11,507 --> 01:57:18,755
At 5, l got fever and
it changed my life forever.

1028
01:57:19,249 --> 01:57:21,585
Polio took away my both legs.

1029
01:57:22,984 --> 01:57:31,432
l was thrilled to crawl
as a liRle girl.

1030
01:57:36,897 --> 01:57:42,675
But when l realised it was
an end of my walking life,

1031
01:57:44,772 --> 01:57:46,541
l cried a lot!

1032
01:57:48,643 --> 01:57:53,717
As l grew older,
l felt like commiRing suicide.

1033
01:57:56,683 --> 01:57:58,218
But it is wrong.

1034
01:57:59,218 --> 01:58:01,120
l must live.

1035
01:58:01,186 --> 01:58:02,722
l must achieve.

1036
01:58:03,856 --> 01:58:10,000
l wished to become a role model
to many like me.

1037
01:58:33,316 --> 01:58:35,218
Death is not a solution.

1038
01:58:36,785 --> 01:58:38,623
l like your aRitude.

1039
01:58:39,822 --> 01:58:41,791
You'll definitely walk!

1040
01:58:42,391 --> 01:58:45,263
l promise.
You will be alright.

1041
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:56,107
By administering polio drops
to children under the age of 5,

1042
01:58:56,204 --> 01:58:58,943
we can eradicate polio.

1043
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:01,677
She's Kalpana, a polio affected girl,

1044
01:59:01,742 --> 01:59:03,745
we did a surgery for her,

1045
01:59:03,810 --> 01:59:06,182
this is after first surgery,
- Okay.

1046
01:59:12,284 --> 01:59:14,489
This one is after the second surgery.

1047
01:59:21,392 --> 01:59:25,934
There are many polio patients
who walked after surgery.

1048
01:59:25,997 --> 01:59:27,767
Pay as much as you can.

1049
01:59:27,832 --> 01:59:31,906
Rest we can seRle after she's well.

1050
01:59:32,002 --> 01:59:33,471
l'm so grateful to you, madam.

1051
01:59:33,537 --> 01:59:36,710
Whatever it may take,

She will be alright.
Don't worry.

02:00:03,465 --> 02:00:05,068
Can we meet again?

1054
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:07,603
We will meet!

1055
02:00:08,003 --> 02:00:13,779
Why did you accompany me?
- You'll be alright.

1056
02:00:13,841 --> 02:00:19,419
Why did you bless me, O Goddess?

1057
02:00:19,513 --> 02:00:31,369
Building a temple in my heart,
l'll protect you..

1058
02:00:31,424 --> 02:00:37,201
l'll sing lullaby to you,
my darling..

1059
02:00:53,043 --> 02:00:55,281
Hi Revathi! Where are you?

1060
02:00:55,346 --> 02:00:57,483
Near Chennai railway station.

1061
02:00:57,581 --> 02:00:59,451

1062
02:00:59,517 --> 02:01:00,685
Beach?

02:01:01,718 --> 02:01:04,256

l came there to meet Revathi
in that time.

1065
02:01:08,158 --> 02:01:13,099
Were you supposed to pay
for your wife's operation?

1066
02:01:13,161 --> 02:01:14,330
Yes, sir.

1067
02:01:15,464 --> 02:01:20,240
You told me about one murder,
what about the rest 34 murders?

1068
02:01:22,237 --> 02:01:24,207
l don't know about all that, sir.

1069
02:01:24,973 --> 02:01:26,742
l killed only one man.

1070
02:01:28,209 --> 02:01:29,310
Oh no!

1071
02:01:29,711 --> 02:01:32,449
This case created a sensation
in Karnataka.

1072
02:01:32,512 --> 02:01:34,616
What's your comment about it to media?

1073
02:01:34,714 --> 02:01:36,484
l'm not going to tell
anything about this case.

1074
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:39,222
We're producing him to CCP
for further investigation.

1075
02:01:39,286 --> 02:01:40,889
l'm sorry, l cannot say anymore.

1076
02:01:40,988 --> 02:01:42,088
Excuse me.

1077
02:01:50,364 --> 02:01:53,535

1078
02:01:53,599 --> 02:01:57,439
look, l've told sir,
please don't put him in cell.

1079
02:01:57,503 --> 02:01:58,538

1080
02:01:58,603 --> 02:01:59,973
Sir, thank you.
- Okay?

1081
02:02:00,072 --> 02:02:00,940
Don't disappoint me.

1082
02:02:01,039 --> 02:02:02,139
No sir.

1083
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:04,309

Okay, sir.

1085
02:02:16,185 --> 02:02:19,259
Nanaiah, do something.

How? How is it possible?

1087
02:02:21,892 --> 02:02:25,198
All the documented reports,

1088
02:02:25,261 --> 02:02:27,765
forensic findings,
witnesses,

1089
02:02:27,831 --> 02:02:29,733

02:02:33,768 --> 02:02:36,708
And the same file has been

02:02:37,372 --> 02:02:39,008
35 murders!

1094
02:02:39,074 --> 02:02:41,510
He must be punished according to law.

1095
02:02:41,575 --> 02:02:43,645
That is according to law books.

1096
02:02:43,744 --> 02:02:46,216
There's a law of heart too.

1097
02:02:46,615 --> 02:02:48,384
Think using it.

1098
02:02:49,617 --> 02:02:51,153
He's a very nice boy.

1099
02:02:52,485 --> 02:02:54,121
He killed only one man.

1100
02:02:54,887 --> 02:02:59,931

with 34 other untraced murders.

1101
02:03:00,427 --> 02:03:01,661

1108
02:03:21,146 --> 02:03:22,481
You take care.

1113
02:04:05,553 --> 02:04:08,425
My husband did so much for me.

1114
02:04:09,124 --> 02:04:11,260
Now he has murdered a man too.

1115
02:04:12,125 --> 02:04:14,062
l don't know anything, sir.

1116
02:04:23,903 --> 02:04:28,445
look here, let bygones be bygones,
don't cry.

1117
02:04:28,508 --> 02:04:29,776

1118
02:04:30,743 --> 02:04:32,578

02:04:32,677 --> 02:04:34,179
l want my husband.

1120
02:04:53,563 --> 02:04:58,472
Sir..sir..

1121
02:05:06,242 --> 02:05:07,611
Not possible now.

1122
02:05:08,744 --> 02:05:12,618
Since there's too much pressure,
l've kept him away elsewhere.

1123
02:05:13,647 --> 02:05:16,755
lt's very difficult
to arrange your meeting.

1124
02:05:18,687 --> 02:05:20,089
Wait for some time.

1125
02:05:20,188 --> 02:05:22,725
Down the line,
l'll arrange to meet him.

1126
02:05:23,424 --> 02:05:24,525
Trust me.

1127
02:05:41,908 --> 02:05:43,644
What are you doing?

1128
02:05:43,709 --> 02:05:46,481
l'm ready..
l'm ready for everything.

1129
02:05:46,579 --> 02:05:48,348
Murdered person was a bad man.

1130
02:05:48,447 --> 02:05:50,517
lf your daughter or my daughter
had been the victim?

1131
02:05:50,583 --> 02:05:52,352
Poor girl has no legs.

1132
02:05:53,017 --> 02:05:54,553
He deserved to die.

1133
02:05:54,652 --> 02:05:56,022
look at this tape.

1134
02:05:57,088 --> 02:05:58,257
Calm down!

1135
02:05:58,355 --> 02:06:02,263
When you so strongly feel
they both should live together,

1136
02:06:02,359 --> 02:06:03,928
l will do my best.

1137
02:06:04,028 --> 02:06:06,999
Saving that kid from Home Minister
is your duty.

1138
02:06:07,063 --> 02:06:09,868
Nobody can save him from me.

1139
02:06:10,734 --> 02:06:12,437
Till now l was quiet.

1140
02:06:12,503 --> 02:06:15,941
l know, how to show him the way!

1141
02:06:16,039 --> 02:06:19,445
Ashok, don't get angry for
talking like this.

1142
02:06:19,509 --> 02:06:24,251
There's a lot of bad talk
about us in the department,

1143
02:06:24,313 --> 02:06:28,154
it seems we both have taken bribe
to handle this case,

1144
02:06:28,250 --> 02:06:33,258
it seems we've made a challenge
to take on the Home Minister,

1145
02:06:33,921 --> 02:06:36,761
it seems we've an affair
with that girl..

1146
02:06:37,492 --> 02:06:40,463
lt seems we've an affair..
an affair with her.

1147
02:06:40,528 --> 02:06:44,568
We're not supporting
an innocent boy.

1148
02:06:44,664 --> 02:06:45,800
A murderer!

1149
02:06:45,866 --> 02:06:49,506
He's a good boy,
that girl is physically challenged,

1150
02:06:49,570 --> 02:06:52,342
for telling about their condition,

1151
02:06:52,406 --> 02:06:54,574
situation is going out of control,

1152
02:06:54,674 --> 02:06:57,913
can't keep him anymore
after this evening,

1153
02:06:57,977 --> 02:06:59,245
do one thing,

1154
02:06:59,311 --> 02:07:00,747
l'm telling for your good,

1155
02:07:00,813 --> 02:07:05,287
hand him over to the prosecution,
send the girl to some orphanage,

1156
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:08,790
we can save from our salary
and help her.

1157
02:07:08,854 --> 02:07:12,160
Don't ask me anything
beyond this, please.

1158
02:07:12,257 --> 02:07:15,229
Please try to understand, Ashok.

1159
02:07:15,993 --> 02:07:17,129
Okay!

1160
02:07:17,796 --> 02:07:18,963
Relax.

1161
02:07:19,530 --> 02:07:22,802
The girl is in Halasuru Police station.

1162
02:07:22,867 --> 02:07:28,009
l'll take her to a nearby
Iadies hostel or orphanage.

1163
02:07:28,104 --> 02:07:30,209
Keep the papers ready.

1164
02:07:30,307 --> 02:07:32,844
l'll handover him to
prosecution by evening.

1165
02:07:32,943 --> 02:07:33,910
Do that.

1166
02:07:34,010 --> 02:07:35,545
lt'll be good for us.

Tighten the security

02:09:28,215 --> 02:09:30,752
He should not leave Bangalore
at any cost.
