My name is,
Nandha Gopalan Kumaran.

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,310
People call me, NGK.

3
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,790
Finally, he's here.

4
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,310
Mr.Kamaraj.
[Noble Politician]

5
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,350
Romance after you're
done with the meal.

6
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,500
Mom!

7
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,180
You got eyes all over.

8
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,970
Mmmm!

9
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,090
Newly weds are bound to find
an excuse and stay indoors.

10
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,880
But you seem to stay
outdoors the most.

11
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,730
We've become a laughing
stock to the neighbors.

12
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,970
You don't like to
live apart from us.

13
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,340
Did I ever mention,
that I don't want to?

14
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,850
Here, she's the one who is
stubborn on not leaving.

15
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,510
Listen--

16
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,430
--if you're disrespectful of my
daughter, I'll whack you.

17
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,580
Be careful!

18
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,660
If at all you're planning to, then take
her abroad, like Singapore or America.

19
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,860
For namesake,
you did M.Tech and Phd.

20
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,180
For about two years,
I took pride in boasting about it

21
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,510
that my son is
working in a huge MNC.

22
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,070
But you quit the job soon after.

23
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,150
And came down to do
"Arakku Agriculture"

24
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,690
"Arakku Agriculture"

25
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,580
My genius mother,
who failed 6th grade one too many times

26
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,720
that's not called
"Arakku Agriculture".

27
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,460
It's called,
"Organic Agriculture".

28
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,920
Working for a MNC,
is not that big a deal.

29
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,420
Once we swipe our ID cards,
they lock us up inside.

30
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,230
Look--

31
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,420
--sitting on cramped up chairs

32
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,390
our spines go sore,
looking at the computers entire day.

33
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,500
Food is served at
the ring of a bell

34
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,790
once it's night,
they open the doors and let us go.

35
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,520
Doesn't it, sound like a prison?

36
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,680
But look at this

37
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,140
it's peaceful

38
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,110
leave early in the morning

39
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,060
get down and work our
hearts out in our field

40
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:53,790
after a heavy lunch,
taking a nap under the tree.

41
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,830
Then when it's evening

42
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,950
catch the beautiful
sight of nightfall.

43
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,960
Amazing!

44
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,140
Beautiful!

45
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,190
The breeze which is laced
with the fragrance of the soil

46
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,210
just close your eyes
and experience it.

47
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,500
But you're stuffed in
heat under this fan.

48
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,790
But out there,
God blesses us with wind.

49
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,710
Philosophical!?

50
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,280
Wonder how she
agreed to marry you?

51
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,290
Definitely she's mad.

52
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,390
That's not called "Madness".

53
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,310
But, "Love".

54
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,670
It's really late,

55
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,890
if not you would've
got whacked by me.

56
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,070
Take this.

57
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,490
Freaking' 20 bucks
for this ice-cream.

58
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,030
Why don't you guys
go to your room?

59
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,630
Don't start off right here.

60
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,650
Ey!

61
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,310
What are you sniffing at?

62
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,650
The fragrance!

63
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,340
Fragrance!?

64
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,050
I'm not wearing any perfume.

65
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,160
It's not the perfume, dear

66
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,760
fragrance of the soil.

67
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,650
That's the best,
what I like about you.

neighbor's water broke

69
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,210

and that rascal kicked her in the stomach.

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,960
At this hour neither a cab
or an ambulance is available.

Please come over soon.

74
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,840
If you had been late by 5
minutes, the mother would've died.

75
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,130
If you were late by 10 minutes,
then both mother and child would've died.

76
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,230
Doctor, what exactly happened?

77
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,600
Both are safe,
she's blessed with a baby boy.

78
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,250

If you would like
to know the truth

81
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,150
I never slept even for a
bit throughout the night.

82
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,870
I'm not posing this as
our party's achievement

83
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,540
only when I heard that the
mother and the child are safe

84
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,980
I was relieved and
came back to life.

Everyone is aware of his nature.

149
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,430
Why did you go to him?

150
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,410
I didn't go there
without a purpose.

151
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,700
I've known him for sometime.

152
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,330
I went to ask for a favor,
as it was an emergency.

153
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,180
Favour!

154
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,780
That too, from him.

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,110
What was the emergency?

156
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:48,480
There's a very good alliance
from Madurai, for my daughter

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,060
The boy is very good.

158
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,530

the moment they met.

159
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,920

--the mother-in-law has
demanded a dowry of Two Lacs.

00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,810
How can I afford it?

162
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,460
I went to the MLA,
'cause I knew him.

163
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,200

164
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,500

consummate the marriage".

170
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,310

00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,590
And you trust me in
lending the money?

179
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,350
Help, shouldn't be offered
based on status or capability.

180
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,820
Help should be
offered to the needy.

181
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,820
Why are you laughing?

182
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,330
Nothing much

183
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,330
let it go.

184
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,330
C'mon say it.

185
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,640
Just let it go.

186
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,210
You wouldn't agree,
to what I have to say.

187
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,530
I can decide only if you say so.

188
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,920
Listen--

189
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,720
--if people like
you join politics

190
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,800
just imagine the well
being of this country.

191
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,570
Are you kidding?

192
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,170
Seems like you don't
like me being at peace.

193
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,020
Ignorance of
educated youngsters--

194
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,820
--has tarnished
our Nation to dust.

195
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,010
I've been observing you

196
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,070
being a nobody,
you do a lot of good deeds.

197
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,200
If at all you step into politics
and take over this constituency

198
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,220
there will be no end
to your good deeds.

199
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,860
Brother come on let's
leave, stop blabbering.

200
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,880
[CROWD CLAMORING]

201
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
What is the issue?

202
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,880
Since 3 weeks, I've been
observing you people waiting here

203
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,700
what seems to be the problem?

204
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,750
Three Weeks!?

205
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,540
It's been Three Months.

206
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,930
Three Months!

207
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,130
We're a group of ten people.

208
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,440
Our fathers were Govt.
employees.

209
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,490
They passed away on duty.

210
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,910
Govt. did announce that their jobs
will be given to their next of kin.

211
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,930
But this Collector,
doesn't seem to sign the order.

212
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,480
What!?
Just get inside and ask them.

213
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,950
Are you new here?

214
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,520
Really!? Collector?

215
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,620
After a long struggle we were
able to meet only the Thasildar.

216
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,520
And he's demanding 5
lacs for a posting.

217
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,880
'Cause this goes high
up till the Collector.

218
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,750
He justifies stating,
we'll make that money in our lifetime.

219
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,470
We did try every
trick from the book.

220
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,780
We lost our hope,
and just come down for namesake.

221
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,310
Listen--

222
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,530
--give me these papers, I'll get
inside and check what's happening.

223
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,710
That's the reason,
we were looking at you...

224
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,080
...but still

225
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,380
Come on give it to
me, I'll be back.

226
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,300
Kumara!

227
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,200
Kumara, is that you?

228
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,830
What are you doing here?

229
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,980
I wonder--

230
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,540
--how you've never
changed since the school.

231
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,320
Don't get angry.

232
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:39,240
This is a silly issue,
I'll get it sorted in five minutes.

233
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,410
You might know the MLA

234
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,040
but do you think,
he'll agree to do this?

235
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,010
The other day with Giri...

236
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,260
Fine, let it go.

237
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,860
MLA is not required
for such petty issues.

238
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,010
Our Councilor,
is more than enough to sort it.

239
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,260
Councilor?

240
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,490
Vanakkam brother.

241
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,220
Listen, who is Latha Manoharan?

242
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,290
People who are here for their dead
father's jobs, please come here

243
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,980
Thasildar has asked
to come over sooner

244
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,600
you can collect your order
from The Collector himself.

245
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,390
Oh God! Please hurry up.

246
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,710
The Collector is
waiting for you people.

247
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,100
Haven't got their call letters,
but started celebrating.

248
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,280
Come on, give way.

249
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,530
-Hey, Raja.
-Mmmm.

250
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,690
Just a Councilor...

251
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,680
...can control The Collector?

252
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,790
You never change, do you?

253
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,960
School topper or a State topper

254
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,100
doesn't help when it
comes down to the streets.

255
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,580
Since last night,
calls have been made to everyone

256
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,790
not sure who is it

257
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,330
it's cringing to
hear them cussing.

258
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,610
They demand to stop everything
related to Organic Farming.

259
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,510
If we don't,

260
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,530
Brother, hearty greetings.
-I'm quite scared, Kumara

261
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,850
I'll call you back.

262
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,210
Tell me.

263
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,690
The others have been
informed well about it.

264
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,490
But you're an Integral cog.

265
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,530
If you favour, the issue will
be resolved in two minutes.

266
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,250
I don't understand.

267
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,030
You formed a group,

268
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,630
and have been doing
a lot of good deeds.

269
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,110
Appreciate it!

270
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,590
Why don't you stop
the Organic Farming?

271
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,190
Please, stop it right away.

272
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,510
Due to that,
we're getting affected.

273
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,780
WE as in?

274
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,820
Right from the
shopkeepers to loan sharks

275
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,670
Fine, I'll come
straight to the point.

276
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,900
Just like how you're their
representative, I am theirs.

277
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,620
So--

278
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,720
--I thought if we get
together and sort this out

279
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,790
That's enough brother,
please stop it.

280
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,680
If I don't stop?

281
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,790
It's Friday an auspicious day,
let's talk about good things.

282
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,460
Stop it!

283
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,080
I'm pretty sure,
you will stop it.

284
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
I'm leaving!

285
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,020
Using artificial fertilizers
destroys the soil

286
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,150
Kolunji, Senapai, Erukku,
Pungo, Venmbu, Adadhoda

287
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,760
we should plant them
in soil as creepers

288
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,760
if we do it, the soil gets
nitrogen in the most natural way.

289
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,760
Soil has been destroyed, Kumara.

290
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,700
They've mixed some chemical--

291
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,470
--and ploughed it
with a machine.

292
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,420
Hereafter,
even the grass won't grow on it.

293
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,190
Oh God,
everything has been destroyed.

294
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,480
They've tarnished everything.

295
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,260
Bloody sinners,
will never prosper.

296
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,700
Kumara!
Just look at this mess.

297
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,370
Son, now this has happened

298
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,120
next they'll turn
us into handicap

299
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,280
moreover,
they're being very abusive.

300
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,500
They're being very abusive.

301
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,180
Brother--

302
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,670
-Sister!
--I beg of you

303
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,270
Let go off everything.

304
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,920
Let us live in peace.

305
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:22,930
My son quit his job to join
and help you with agriculture.

306
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,150
After looking at the incidents

307
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,330
he committed suicide.

308
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,670
We rushed him to the hospital

309
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,110
by the grace of
"Goddess Maariaatha"

310
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,960
he is out of danger now.

311
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:43,010
For God sake,
don't destroy their lives.

312
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,510
Brother, this is a grave issue.

313
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,200
You made too many
enemies at once.

314
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,230
Loan Sharks

315
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,710
Pesticides businesses

316
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,850
Vegetable traders who sell
them at exorbitant prices

317
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,320
Do you think they're
alone on this matter?

318
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,490
And then comes the Police

319
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,710
Ward Councilor

320
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,970
Municipality

321
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,510
including our MLA has
a cut in the profits.

322
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,250
If you jump in and
change everything

323
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,680
their income is affected.

324
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,400
Brother,
please think of a solution.

325
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Poor thing.

326
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,390
People invested
their trust in me

327
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,280
and got into this mess.

328
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,860
You better do one thing

329
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,310
go and meet the
MLA straight away.

330
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,590
If he decides,
then will make it happen.

331
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,140
Who?

332
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:08,930
are you referring to, Pandian?

333
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,710
-he's a bloody....
-Ey!

334
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,280
Let that go.

335
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,580
Think on practical terms.

336
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,520
The gang of loan sharks

337
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,130
is a mafia itself.

338
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,280
If someone powerful like Pandian
asks, they'll obey.

339
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,140
Fine!

340
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,890
If that's the case

341
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,320
why would he even
help me with this?

342
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,030
This is extremely atrocious.

343
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,660
You're underestimating
your power.

344
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,750
Elections are around the corner.

345
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,730
You have a great
reputation with the people.

346
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,510
At least for that sake,
he'll agree to meet you.

347
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,310
We'll think about
the rest later.

348
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,890
Ey, come on move...move

349
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,850
move, come on he's our friend.

350
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,630
Ok, brother.

351
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,170
He's Raja's friend.

352
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Hi Kumara,

353
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,480
how come you're here?

354
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,760
MLA Sir...

355
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,750
...want to meet him.

356
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,630
MLA!?

357
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,570
That--

358
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,850
--that man is

359
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,440
What is it?
Is it something urgent?

360
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,410
Mmmm!

361
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:40,970
Listen!

362
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,520
You're asking for a huge
help in the name of favour.

363
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,040
Sir--

364
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,860
--an entire town is...
-Mmm-hmm!

365
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,710
-Hmmm
-Chief!

366
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,520
Did you calculate?

367
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,020
if we do him this favour,
what will be our loss?

368
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,580
Nothing substantial though.

369
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,010
Loan sharks, shopkeepers

370
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,830
even after the bribes,
it's a meager amount.

371
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,180
If you ask them,
they'll shut their pie holes.

372
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,360
Ramakrishna!

373
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,190
that's right,
the impending issue

374
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,550
Kumaran has come to meet me.

375
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,070
Get this done with, right away.

376
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,650
I have given my word to him.

377
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,730
Ah-- so are we good?

378
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,390
Get it done.

379
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,080
He'll get it done.

380
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,510
Sir...

381
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,140
...thank you!

382
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,330
-Ey!
-Huh?

383
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,710
What happened?

384
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,460
Sir!

385
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:59,100
You came got your work
done, and just leaving

386
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,100
I don't get it, Sir.

387
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,580
Don't you get it?

388
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,860
I've done what you had asked for

389
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,430
what are you going
to do in return?

390
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,710
It's not like that

391
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,640
for the people, you...

392
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,900
Damn it!

393
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,190
I helped, 'cause of the reputation
you have with the people.

394
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,690
Better be clear on what
you will do in return.

395
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,620
If not, I'll call them back

396
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,920
then they'll destroy you.

397
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,380
Brother, brother...

398
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,530
...ah, brother

399
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,320
brother, brother

400
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,330
-brother!
-My Lord!

401
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,710
What brought you here?

402
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,680
Your wounds are still fresh.

403
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,360
Chief,
it was me who brought him here.

404
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,230
Oh...!

405
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,360
So you're a gang of thieves.

406
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,950
Are you going to tell me,
what you'll do in return?

407
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,930
if not, bloody moron

408
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,470
Chief,
he's not as simple as you think

409
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,840
he's got an army behind him.

410
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,230
That too youngsters.

411
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,250
They'll be very sharp
with their work.

412
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,440
You just give us the nod

413
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,960
brother here,
will join our party with 500 members.

414
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,590
-Brother!?
-Ssshh!

415
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,040
Just imagine--

416
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,410
--if you go to the High
Command with the youngsters

417
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,940
your status will soar heights.

418
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,910
Elections are around the corner.

419
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,330
Ah...!

420
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,760
Listen--

421
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,440
--will you join our
party with 500 members?

422
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,740
Chief, I vouch for him.

423
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:35,890
Ey!

424
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,860
If I lose my temper

425
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,410
I'll hack you into pieces

426
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,690
bloody moron!

427
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,020
Ey-- Kumara!

428
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,780
I'm talking to you.

429
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,040
Will you join our
party with 500 members?

430
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,020
Then, fine

431
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,490
we're even now.

432
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,210
I'll tell you when to come over.

433
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,700
Be ready!

434
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,440
Ey!

435
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,780
Have you decided to run the
entire family into the grave?

436
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:23,690
Huh!?

437
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:29,080
I didn't bother,
as you were into social service.

438
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,650
But now,
you want to get into politics.

439
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,270
Hey!

440
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,320
Politics is a graveyard.

441
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,320
No one has returned alive
by stepping into it.

442
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,720
Your father and I

443
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,410
had many dreams pinned and
spent a fortune on education

444
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,830
you're now throwing it all away.

445
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,210
Listen--

446
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,770
--can you please calm down?

447
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,290
The people are happy now.

448
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,360
For this to happen--

449
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,140
--you don't know,
what I had to go through

450
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,070
But that, MLA

451
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,890
made it happen,
like it was nothing

452
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,450
he changed the lives of everyone

453
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,780
Not only him

454
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,850
even my friend, Raja

455
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,430
he's just a votary of that party

456
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,310
The things they do it in a jiffy

457
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,930
we end up slogging for
it our entire life.

458
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,980
I've been observing everything

459
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,590
I have--

460
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,880
--given a deep thought about it

461
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,850
Is that enough?

462
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,340
Only if I get into it,
can change the system

463
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,440
I'm taking it up.

464
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,250
Will step in,
and bring the change.

465
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,360
You're going to witness it.

466
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,240
Fine, get into it

467
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,110
tomorrow when you return

468
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,450
you'll find us all dead.

469
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,680
Mother-in-Law!

470
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,730
Can you please stop this?

471
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,320
I've been patient about it.

472
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,070
Let's not trouble him.

473
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,970
Whatever he feels right--

474
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,280
--let him do it.

475
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,570
Oh God!

476
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,120
-Have you gone mad too?
-Ma!

477
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,270
Will you please get inside?

478
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,270
Viji.

479
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,000
Mmmm.

480
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,740
He'll never do anything
against his morals.

481
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,740
Listen--

482
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,220
--how is struggling for
nation's welfare is wrong?

483
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,930
I have confidence.

484
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,380
As far as you do, it's fine.

485
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,280
I don't like your tone.

486
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,290
Can't you say something nice?

487
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,420
Fine, you go.

488
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,490
But don't come back a loser.

489
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,470
This resonates the same tone.

490
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,390
Kumara!

491
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,720
go ahead dear---

492
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,310
---If you step in, even
the sewers will turn pure.

[CROWD CHEERING]

494
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,480
Kumara,
do you see the guy on the right?

495
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,800
His name is Saghayam.

496
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,850
If he touches his nose,
you have to scream out loud.

497
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,380
but when he touches his ear,
you have to applaud harder.

498
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,630
A bit-- damn it.

499
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,100
If he touches his thigh

500
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,960
you gotta take a leap forcing
yourself to meet the Chief.

501
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,160
Do you understand?

502
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:39,460
"Beloved throbbing
spines inside my veins."

503
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,310
Kumara! Kumara!

504
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,890
come on scream out loud.

505
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,540
Brother, how does a spine
throbs inside a vein?

506
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,570
Yes, shut up and
just scream out loud.

507
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,820
On the occasion of my birthday--

508
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:10,800
--millions have gathered
like a wave of the Tsunami.

509
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,310

on this beautiful day--

510
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:25,150
--it's the period where everyone
is shaken by the ruling party.

00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,650
My dear young Lion, come on up.

515
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,500
Brother Kumara, Chief is calling you.
C'mon go ahead.

516
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,940
When was I part of
the ruling party?

517
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,990
Ssshhh...they're calling you.

518
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,200
Come on, go over there.

519
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,410
come on, keep moving.

520
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,100

Go!

00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,190
-Welcome, Kumara -Chief,
this the guy I was talking about.

523
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,370
-Come on, son.
-Go on, hug him tight.

524
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,760
In respect to
appreciate Kumaran--

525
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,290
--I'm rewarding him
with this Golden Sword.

526
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,660
The youngsters from the ruling
party, floating on false hope

527
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,630
I wish,
you bring them all to us.

528
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,080
Will you do it?

529
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,770
-Will you do it?
-Tell him, you'll do it.

530
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,320
Will you do it?

531
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,200

My dear Pandiya,
who is behind this great achievement

534
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,410
Give that to me.

00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,280

537
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,200
come on, get lost.

538
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,320
Thought getting into politics will
pave way for doing more good deeds.

539
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,570
Golden Sword!

540
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,890
Pretending to be someone.

541
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,540
I don't get any of this.

542
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,220
Politics is very deep.

543
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,440
You've just stepped into it.

544
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,930
You'll understand eventually.

545
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,390
I'm not sure, brother.

546
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,340
I have a feeling,
that I'm doing something wrong.

547
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:36,570
Moreover, people doesn't have a
good impression about politicians.

548
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,580
Just wait and watch.

549
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,910
I'll teach you exactly,
what a politician can do.

550
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,850
Just sit back and watch.

551
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,780
Ey-- ******!

552
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,020
stop the vehicles, damn it.

553
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,590
stop that ******* auto.

554
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,680
********!

555
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,690
Ey...!

556
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,230
What do you think of
me, bloody idiots.

557
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,820
Ey!

558
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,960
I kill you, I'll kill you all.

559
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,680
Ey!

560
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,900
What the heck have
you been doing?

561
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,020
Here, a Goddess--

562
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,780
--my dear Mother of Dharma.

563
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:21,930
She's been stranded for half an
hour, not able to cross the road.

564
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,540
But you guys have been
looking at her like morons.

565
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,240
Freaking, I'll kill them all.

566
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,420
I'll kill them all.

567
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,950
Sir, Sir!

568
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,160
Please don't get angry.

569
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,710
You please leave from here.

570
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,050
-Ey, hold the traffic.
-Ok, Sir!

571
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,430
Hey, stop all the vehicles.

572
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,450
Come on, stop.
Auto, please stop.

573
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,620
My dear son,
I pray that you live in prosperity.

574
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,300
Come on take this
for your expenses.

575
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,610
You please leave from here.

576
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:49,950
You've been blocking
the traffic.

577
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,320
You better be scared of me.

578
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,450
If this was done
by a common man--

579
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,490
--they would've thrashed him.

580
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,030
Hope you understand now--

581
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,310
--the importance of
being an Politician.

582
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,240
I've understood it well.

583
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,410
Firstly--

584
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,140
--I need to buy at
least 10 boxers.

585
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,300
You're damn funny.

586
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,790
Come on eat your food.

587
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,000
They don't give second serving.

588
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,660
-Brother Giri
-Mmmm.

589
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,080
Introduce me to the good
politicians of the party.

590
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,370
Gotta discuss about the
issues of our people.

591
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,830
Don't be too enthused
on the very first day.

592
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,360
You're well educated--

593
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,960
--no matter what job you're in

594
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,070
you got to climb up the
ladder, one step at a time.

595
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,810
Aren't you aware of it?

596
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,220
Hey...hey...hey

597
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,340
Ey-- look here pass it on

598
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,270
Ey--Ey!

599
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,300
Hey, I'm diabetic and can't run

600
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,730
come on pass it on,
I'm not able to run

601
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,180
Welcome, Mr.Kumara.

602
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,920
No, no, no, no...

603
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,620
"The Golden Sword"

604
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,460
Ey-- look over here guys

605
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,250
The Golden Sword has arrived.

606
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,910
What is it?

607
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,820
Nothing much...

608
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,380
Is there any job for me?

609
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,100
That's the reason--

610
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,940
--educated morons

611
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,050
should pick the
stream they belong to.

612
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,260
Stepping into politics
with a meager crowd--

613
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,270
--doesn't mean they'll
make you one of their own.

614
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:18,590
If you suck up to
everyone for 30 years

615
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,230
you might land a
posting in the party.

616
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,470
Fine, you did get me a recognition
among the party members.

617
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,240
I do owe you one.

618
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,230
Next time,
I'll help you with something huge.

619
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,140
You should be
grateful than a dog.

620
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,200
Understood!?

621
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,470
Go on, join the herd.

622
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,010
First make sure you get
water in the toilet.

623
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,960
The taps aren't
working it seems.

624
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:51,140
The sad state of MLA hostel.

625
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,290
Come on hurry up.

626
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,530
First make sure to
clean the toilet--

627
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,890
--then get the water.

628
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:36,480
Mr.Golden Sword,
the water wasn't enough

629
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,420
it didn't flush well

630
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,670
take that broom and...Eh, Eh!

631
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,780
also wash all of
my dirty clothes.

632
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,550
I'm leaving out of
town in the morning.

633
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,130
What are you looking at?
come on deal the cards.

634
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,030
Ok, Chief!

635
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,170
Mr.Sword!

636
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,270
Mmmm!

637
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,950
There will a number
under the name G

638
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,280
call that number and
just ask to come down

639
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,630
-Chief, I'll make that call
-Shut up, damn it.

640
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,600
Hey, Kumara

641
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,860
why are you enduring this?

642
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,680
Instead of being at peace,
you're stuck with him

643
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,040
Tell me something, Raja

644
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,940
I've seen you play poker

645
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,900
you always win.

646
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,030
Why do you keep losing to him?

647
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,900
No one should win against him.

648
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,300
If not he'll tie them to
a tree and beat them up.

649
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,120
That sadist gets
a kick out of it.

650
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,110
Chief, you're going overboard

651
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
you're asking Kumaran
to drop the girl.

652
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,380
What's wrong, if he drops her?

653
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,730
Social worker,
Votary of the people-- Mr.Kumaran

654
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,930
****** moron!

655
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:33,930
Let him do it.

656
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,980
He tarnished my name
in that locality.

657
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,730
Cleaning the sewers,
Organic farming

658
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,910
that's why I made
him clean my shit.

659
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,000
Ey---get out and cough.

660
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:47,110
Why the hell is
your nose bleeding?

661
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,800
You must've chug down
the whole bottle.

662
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,380
Hey, Kumara!

663
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,120
We saw you on the TV.

664
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,820
They rewarded you
with a Golden Sword.

665
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,000
But I don't see any
sword in your hands?

666
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,930
Listen, mother-in-law has made
your favourite mutton curry.

667
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,660
Hurry up, before it gets cold...

668
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,970
The people and the
Leaders of the party--

669
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,440
--think very less of the votary.

670
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,160
Hanging on to the vehicles

671
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,750
Biriyani, Liquor

672
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,440
they've made peace with it.

673
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,250
But our generation
is nothing like that.

674
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,300
We're educated

675
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,260
we know what we're doing.

676
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,830
Our perspective is
entirely different.

677
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:52,860
Starting from roots,
no matter how huge the matter is

678
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,260
That's the beauty of it!

679
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,540
Brothers!

680
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:57,510
Vanakkam brothers!

681
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,330
Vanakkam brothers!

682
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:00,230
Vanakkam...

683
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:01,980
Vanakkam!

684
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,190
Oh no!

685
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,840
The bathroom looks
spick and span.

686
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:26,940
Uh!

687
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,920
Ey-- what's happening here?

688
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,730
Who prepared so much food?

689
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,070
Chief! Chief!

690
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,330
Chief, Chief...Chief

691
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,080
Come on move...Chief!

692
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,260
It was me.

693
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,610
Amazing!

694
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:07,940
It's delicious!

695
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:10,840
Which restaurant is it from?

696
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,500
I prepared everything myself.

697
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:21,520
I cooked all your
favourite dishes...

698
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,040
Fantastic!

699
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,690
Educated and can cook?

700
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:32,850
Yes!

701
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:36,050
Somehow I manage to with your
grace, Chief.

702
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:42,940
Ey-- what's with this look?

703
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:49,720
You've changed.

704
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:54,770
That mole...

705
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,440
...you've stuck it on
you, right?

706
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,740
Remove that please,
it reminds me of someone.

707
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,240
Wow!

708
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,380
I will learn, Chief.

709
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,650
Where are you headed?

710
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:16,250
I'm going to wash
your dirty clothes.

711
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,940
Fine, carry on.

712
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,910
Hey, hold on!

713
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:24,590
Usually you end up
calling me Sir or Boss

714
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,210
What's with this "Chief" now?

715
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,650
I will learn, Chief.

716
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:43,700
Wonder how he learned to cook--

717
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,000
--he reminded me of
my mother's cooking.

718
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:49,670

00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,940
We need someone like him.

Keep him paid and
take care of him.

What happened?

772
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,680
Hey, Raja!

773
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:35,350
Hey!

774
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:39,090
He came to me a year ago,
it's End-Stage disease.

775
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,540
I mean Terminal Cancer.

776
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,740
there's no cure for it.

777
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:43,740
Anytime death!

778
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,540
He's well aware of it.

779
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:17,630
What is this place, Chief?

780
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,140
This is our Party Headquarters.

781
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,330
Press 9

782
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,580
There are only 8
buttons out here.

783
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,230
Press both 8 and 1
at the same time.

784
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,080
That's the floor,
the High Command presides.

785
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,060
It's not easy to get there.

786
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:52,980
You will be summoned
only to get questioned.

787
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,770
Are all the papers in order?

788
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,660
Mmmm, yes they're in order.

789
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,530
My dear, don't call me
"Chief" in front of them

790
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,350
they'll gouge my eyes out.

791
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:11,580
You better stay outside.

792
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,410
On top of it, that Vanathi--

793
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,630
--will kill me
with her questions.

794
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,330
Who is that?

795
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,200
Vanathi...!

796
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:30,530
Is she, Chief's...huh...huh?

797
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:31,960
No, no, no, no...

798
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,890
This is entirely different.

799
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:38,090
She's the PR head of
entire Indian Operation.

800
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,950
High Command, doesn't do
anything without consulting her.

801
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,470
What should be
spoken at a meeting

802
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,110
what's happening
in the constituency

803
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,640
the culprits who swindled

804
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:49,790
how much bribe was distributed

805
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:53,300
not only that, the motto of
the party and the election plan.

806
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,450
To whom and what should
be spoken at Delhi

807
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:58,190
Which party will favour the
victory if made an alliance.

808
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,480
She decides them all.

809
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:04,510
She'll be on her
laptop all the time.

810
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:07,230
She's a deadly women.

811
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:11,090
She'll skin and fry you alive.

812
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:15,460
What are you saying, Chief?

813
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,720
Why are you scared of her?

814
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:23,240
You got to fear,
when it's required.

815
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:32,980
Ey-- make sure you're in sight.

816
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,290
Vanakkam, High Command.

817
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,680
You've been an MLA thrice.

818
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:51,980
With the support of caste votes.

819
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,400
You haven't done squat till now.

820
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,110
How come all of a sudden now?

821
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,370
In this past 6 months,
you've tended to all the petitions.

822
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:01,440
Mmmm!?

823
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,800
The entire constituency
is praising you.

824
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:06,610
How's that?

825
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,930
Is it 'cause,
election is around the corner?

826
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:12,250
It's not that ma'am,
I just did it for the people...

827
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,770
I did it to gain more
reputation for the party.

828
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,020
-I...
-Ey..

829
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,840
...don't make me swear at you.

830
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,680
Are you going to blurt it out?

831
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,400
I joined hands with educated
youths from the constituency

832
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:41,650
Are you talking about
the guy standing outside?

833
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:44,790
No, no...he's just garbage.

834
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,020
He's just a helping hand.

835
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,220
I just brought him
along for company.

836
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,990
This is an agricultural land

837
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:04,280
how come you've given permission
to construct a building?

838
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:07,550
It's wrong according
to RULE #43 C

839
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,030
Your garbage--

840
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:16,520
sorry

841
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:19,010
--call your helping hand inside.

842
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:26,370
-Pandiya!
-High Command!

843
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,130
I've warned you not
to lie to Vanathi.

844
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:36,330
What is this?

845
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,160
You don't need his permission.

846
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,490
You tell me.

847
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:47,820
That's right, Ma'am.

848
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:50,070
It is wrong according
to Rule #43C

849
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,000
but according to #44E

850
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,970
if the Thasildar certifies
it's not an agricultural land,

851
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,630
we can construct
buildings over there.

852
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,070
I've attached the
certificates for reference.

853
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:01,100
What is being constructed there?

854
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,310
Is it Dental College
under a shell name?

855
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,720
No madam.

856
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:10,040
There are many chemical
factories around

857
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,800
the number of cancer patients
have increased in that area.

858
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,930
So we're building a
Free Cancer Institute.

859
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:21,620
Free!?

860
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,160
That too him?

861
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:25,000
Not him, madam.

862
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,660
United Nations in India.

863
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,290
They've applied and
it's been sanctioned.

864
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:34,110
Not only that--

865
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:36,610
--If Pandiyan Sir
continues to be the MLA

866
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,110
our future plans

867
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:39,620
have a look at the graph

868
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,400
development comparison
for the last 20 years

869
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,940
GDP growth compared to
other constituencies.

870
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,690
What have you pursued?

871
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,780
-Oh no! he's done nothing
-Ey-- shut up!

872
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:52,810
Tell me.

873
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,870
M.Tech, Environmental
Science and Engineering.

874
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,290
And of course, Agriculture.

875
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:02,650
Politics!?

876
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:06,960
I'm learning, Madam.

877
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,750
Ok, he doesn't need you anymore.

878
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,700
You can join our PR team.

879
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:15,290
Sorry Madam!

880
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:21,590
I won't leave Pandian
Sir, for anything.

881
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:26,650
Thank you so much.

882
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:28,870
It's been a pleasure
meeting you.

883
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,090
High Command!

884
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,090
Must've been the good deeds
from my previous birth

885
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:38,010
The spines are throbbing
inside my veins.

886
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:39,440
It's rising high.

887
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,110
Hail High Command!

888
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,890
-Chief!
-Hey...!

889
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,230
I don't like him.

890
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,750
He fed my own quotes to me.

891
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,270
There's something
fishy about him.

892
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,070
In my 40 years of experience--

893
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,180
--he seems like a
weird character.

894
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:05,190
It's better you keep him under
the, Red List!

895
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,920
Call in the next one.

896
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,620
Hey!

897
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,680
I signed entrusting you

898
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:39,380
who asked you to get the
cancer thing to be done?

899
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,080
Oh no!

900
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,430
I did inform you, Chief.

901
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,850
You were pretty
sloshed the other day.

902
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:56,730
Still...

903
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:01,520
...I thought you'll leave
me for Vanathi's offer

904
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:05,470
If I leave you--

905
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,450
--then who will
clean the toilet?

906
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:29,420
Five days

907
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:30,950
haven't been to the hotel

908
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,660
neither have I
changed my underwear

909
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:34,170
no luck!

910
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,050
CM and the ruling party
are very cautious.

911
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:39,590
No matter how much we dig
deeper, it's the usual

912
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:43,290
Scams, Political Murders--
but nothing special.

913
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:45,860
We exactly have 6 months
for the elections.

914
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:47,350
Keep trying.

915
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,780
We need something huge

916
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,750
we have to instigate the
people and hit them with a wave

917
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,040
Vanathi!

918
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:56,790
we tried everything possible

919
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,320
couldn't find anything

920
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,570
personal emails,
Facebook...nothing.

921
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:03,270
They're very careful.

922
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:04,890
Keep trying.

923
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:13,090
Hail High Command!

924
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:30,820
Not bad--

925
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:33,150
--you made it in 10 minutes.

926
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:35,420
Seems like you don't sleep.

927
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,490
Seems like you
don't sleep as well.

928
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:39,100
Madam!

929
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,480
No madam.

930
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:41,730
I am Va...

931
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,140
Vanathi Thiagarajan,
M.A.Political Science Cambridge University.

932
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,730
Worked for Times
magazine for 4 years

933
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:49,090
worked for almost all PR companies and
started her own called "Solutions".

934
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:52,350
Prime Minister's office, 3 Chief
Ministers totaling 15 Political parties.

935
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:54,260
from which 3 Political parties
are unknown to this world.

936
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:56,640
You've drowned 7 political
parties and helped 3 win.

937
01:00:56,930 --> 01:00:59,500
Just 'cause High Command
insisted you've been helping him.

938
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,400
It's 'cause you both
are remotely related.

939
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:02,880
Even the party members
are unaware of it.

940
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,030
Your salary for a
month is 1.2 Crores.

941
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,580
If you've called me at this hour,
must be something really important.

942
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:09,100
Good Evening, Ms.Vanathi.

943
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,590
Tell me, how can I help you?

944
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,240
You are Kumara...

945
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:18,590
Nandha Gopalan Kumaran.

946
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:21,580
the rest is mentioned in the
files on your table downstairs.

947
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:23,600
You must've gone through it.

948
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,660
So it'll be great,
if you get straight to the point.

949
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:27,490
You!

950
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,080
Too smart.

951
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:49,830
Welcome to my den.

952
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:14,910
Come, I need some
information from you.

953
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:32,030
CM

954
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:33,630
Killvazhuvan!

955
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:39,180
If you wanna light it,
shouldn't do it from top

956
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:41,280
it'll take time to
reach the bottom

957
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:43,520
neither you should
light it from down below

958
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,310
it'll take longer for
it to reach the top.

959
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,660
Mmmm!

960
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:49,310
So, if you light
up the middle front

961
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,600
it'll light both the top
and the bottom right away.

962
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:58,280
Kesava Moorthy:
Health Minister

963
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:01,370
under his support,
illegally foreign medical companies

964
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,280
are testing the medicines
on the patients over here.

965
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,620
This information is useless.

966
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:11,980
This will never
reach the public.

967
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:13,590
They'll forget about
it in two days.

968
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:16,900
They need some strong
sentiment to hold on to.

969
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:24,180
Who are you calling?

970
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,410
Underground!

971
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:28,910
The lowest votary of the party

972
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,440
will be the keeper
of all the secrets.

973
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,100
-Ah, brother Giri.
-Ah!

974
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,590
What is it?
How come you're calling in so late?

975
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:36,950
It's urgent,
just answer to the question.

976
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:38,900
Weren't you part of the
ruling party earlier?

977
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:42,500
That's right, as it didn't work
out, I shifted to opposition.

978
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,930
Are you aware of Kesava Moorthy?

979
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,770
I know him well,
he's a womanizer.

980
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:48,260
Even during the last week.
-Ssshhh...

981
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:50,200
I want to know more about him.

982
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:14,810
Thanks for the help.

983
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,380
We got what we needed.

984
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,290
But what you're
asking in return--

985
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,050
--is quite impossible.

986
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:22,600
Even If I agree to do it--

987
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,110
--not sure if it will work out.

988
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,590
You have a very little exposure.

989
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:29,640
But I can guide you.

990
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:31,380
The rest is in your hands.

991
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,160
It's just pure luck.

992
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:35,670
What!?

993
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:38,110
First time I met Vanathi?

994
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,750
No, I don't understand
your question.

995
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,410
Hey!

996
01:04:57,980 --> 01:04:58,980
What happened?

997
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:11,010
I smell perfume on you.

998
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:18,630
I'm coming from
Party Headquarters.

999
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,230
May be someone out there
must've have wore perfume.

1000
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:34,920
Ladies Perfume!

1001
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,620
very , very strong!

1002
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:41,500
It's not imperative that only
men work in such a huge office.

1003
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,920
Even I used to wear perfume.

1004
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:45,990
I used to like it a lot.

1005
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:48,250
I know a lot about it.

1006
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:53,960
There are many ways someone's
perfume sticking on to others

1007
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,340
For instance,

1008
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:59,960
if you pass by,
it won't stick longer

1009
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,750
even if someone stays
this close for long

1010
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,670
you will just get a whiff of it

1011
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,400
May be if--

1012
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:12,390
--someone gets so close

1013
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,820
it will only stick to the face

1014
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:18,070
But this...

1015
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:20,230
Hey, hey...Ey, Ey!

1016
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:21,210
Let go!

1017
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,750
Only if something
like this happens

1018
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:30,280
it gets through the body reaches
the nose and ignites the fragrance.

1019
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:32,680
Ey-- what's wrong with you?

1020
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:34,320
Huh!?

1021
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:36,840
It's wrong.

1022
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:39,010
-Hey...
-It's wrong!

1023
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,810
Something is not right.

1024
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:51,570
Come on, don't tell me you're
so serious about the perfume.

1025
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,060
Ma, you're very innocent.

1026
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:55,830
You're not aware of anything.

1027
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:58,650
Who? Me is it?

1028
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,260
Even when your Father-in-law

1029
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:04,320
gets back from duty abroad,
he will smell of perfume.

1030
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:05,970
Mmmm!

1031
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:09,450
May be even he was
having an affair.

1032
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,390
Oh...!

1033
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,740
What if he did?

1034
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:17,380
Aren't you his mother?

1035
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:19,050
-confront your son.
-Dad!

1036
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,820
It's getting late, Dad.

1037
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:22,480
The day I got him married to you

1038
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,720
-Patience, son.
-since then, I'm done.

1039
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:27,080
You've asked for something
out of the ordinary.

1040
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:31,220
It's a special Military line.

1041
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:33,920
Untraceable!

1042
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:42,940
Fine, what's wrong with
both quarreling outside?

1043
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,300
Geetha is suspicious--

1044
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:53,430
--that I'm having an affair.

1045
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,080
Are you?

1046
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:01,960
What nonsense?

1047
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:03,940
Which ****** is calling
me at this time?

1048
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:08,130
The ******* who served
this country for 30 years.

1049
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:11,410
I'm Retd. Major General
Ramanan, speaking you moron.

1050
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:12,820
Sir!
Yes Sir!

1051
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:16,790
At ease, Colonel.

1052
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:18,330
Sir, thank you, Sir!

1053
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:19,990
I need some information.

1054
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,170
Yes Sir!

1055
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,410
Do you know the
current CBI Director?

1056
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,230
No Sir.

1057
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:25,940
Brigadier Sharma,
knows him well.

1058
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:27,510
They're close friends, Sir.

1059
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:28,960
-How close?
-Ah...

1060
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:29,960
...Sir

1061
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:31,800
Tell me Colonel, it's an order.

1062
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:33,900
Yes, Sir.
They're bar mates, Sir.

1063
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,310
They drink every Sunday.

1064
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:37,430
And...and do Bang-Bang, Sir.

1065
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,620
What? Bang-Bang?

1066
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:40,630
Same women?

1067
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,120
No Sir, different women.

1068
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,500
They both are best
Bang-Bang friends, Sir.

1069
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,850
Ok, listen carefully.

1070
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,680
Yes Sir!

1071
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,860
Ask Sharma to speak to
CBI Director immediately.

1072
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,660
I need some information.

1073
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,690
Since he got into Politics

1074
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,330
every thing has
changed about him

1075
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:59,600
The thing he had on me...

1076
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:04,200
Love!

1077
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,710
...do you think it
wouldn't have changed?

1078
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:13,450
Why don't you confront
him, yourself?

1079
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:16,130
Is this enough?

1080
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,860
or you're looking
for something more?

1081
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,010
Dad!

1082
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:22,420
Never knew you were
such a big shot.

1083
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:25,870
That respect is not
something I deserve

1084
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,990
do you see that medal,
"Param Vir Chakra"

1085
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,250
the highest award in Military

1086
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:34,160
the respect is offered to that.

1087
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:37,330
A person when dies and
is taken in a coffin

1088
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:41,200
the world doesn't give a damn about
the wealth, position or status

1089
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,910
Only your achievements
will stick to you.

1090
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:53,150
Hey!

1091
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:54,670
What is it? Who are you? Ey!

1092
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:56,580
Ey, hold on...Ey!

1093
01:09:56,710 --> 01:09:57,590
Listen...

1094
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:03,720
Hey...!

1095
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,440
If Intelligence
Bureau has nabbed me

1096
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:25,960
I'm sure something
is very serious.

1097
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,600
Let's not beat him
up for no reason.

1098
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:42,660
I'll only talk to the CM.

1099
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:46,170
It's better you start talking,
if they start beating you up...

1100
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:48,700
I don't mind though...

1101
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,080
...but the thing is,
it's a personal matter for CM.

1102
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:56,950
It's better,
if it's only for his ears.

1103
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,070
Isn't he beside you?

1104
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:01,330
Ask him to talk to me.

1105
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:05,360
CM is not God though.

1106
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,450
Won't he speak to the Public?

1107
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,220
I've been looking forward to--

1108
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,490
--speak to that person
who has swindled millions.

1109
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,050
OUT!

1110
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:26,970
What is Nandha Gopalan
Kumaran, saying?

1111
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:33,600
Good Afternoon, CM Sir.

1112
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:37,280
Social Activist

1113
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:40,200
got into the opposition
party in haste.

1114
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:42,400
You're the only helping
hand of Pandian.

1115
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:43,750
All that is fine.

1116
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,770
But you---

1117
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:50,740
---went to meet Vanathi during
late night at their own office

1118
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:52,760
we've been observing you

1119
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,600
you see Elections are
around the corner.

1120
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:56,750
Sir!

1121
01:11:57,290 --> 01:12:01,400
So, Intelligence bureau is not
present to nab the criminals?

1122
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,350
You have 10 seconds, if not--

1123
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:09,140
Sir, I only speak the truth.

1124
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,250
Hope you get it.

1125
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:11,720
First, start talking.

1126
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:18,170
If I start talking,
will you do me a favour in return?

1127
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:21,560
Hey-- how dare you
negotiate with me?

1128
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:25,770
-In a second, I'll...
-make me disappear

1129
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,570
I really don't mind.

1130
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:31,600
My information is like having
lunch at a five star restaurant.

1131
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,960
In return,
I'm just asking for a small tip.

1132
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:35,760
Ah...

1133
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,240
Not only that--

1134
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:42,050
--Vanathi will share
everything with me.

1135
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:44,760
And I'll tell you
everything what she says.

1136
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:49,370
Honorable Leader!

1137
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:51,980
Just give it a thought.

1138
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,420
Kumaran,
you're not even a mosquito to me.

1139
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:01,170
First tell me, then I'll decide.

1140
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,250
Only I decide!

1141
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:06,040
Now, shut the ****
up and spit it out.

1142
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:08,610
You're amazing with English.

1143
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:12,460
Seems like you have
plans to get to Delhi?

1144
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:16,610
But you've been
working hard for it.

1145
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:19,790
You just studied
until 8th grade--

1146
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,040
--but should appreciate
Catherine teacher for her efforts

1147
01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:27,260
Dearest lover!

1148
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,700
A wife hidden from
the eyes of the world.

1149
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,350
Am I right, CM Sir.

1150
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:33,850
Untie him and stay outside.

1151
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:35,490
Wait for my orders.

1152
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:36,560
Ok, Sir!

1153
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,030
You gotta talk to
survive these days...

1154
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:48,620
here...

1155
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,580
I'm saying this
for your own good.

1156
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:58,710
You do know who's been
threatening to break your party.

1157
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:02,720
Kesava Moorthy!

1158
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:04,280
Am I right?

1159
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,270
In next two days,
his Political career will be doomed.

1160
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,750
I will make it happen.

1161
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:10,240
How?

1162
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:12,510
I'm well aware

1163
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,300
but won't give out my idea

1164
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:17,800
The opposition is digging
for dirt on your party

1165
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:21,530
at the same time,
it should benefit you as well.

1166
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:25,970
I'm in favour of
both the parties.

1167
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,790
No matter who is gonna win,
I should survive, right?

1168
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,400
I like you.

1169
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:36,670
Shall we talk for
another five minutes?

1170
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,300
Just 5 minutes!

1171
01:14:40,190 --> 01:14:40,980
Ok!

1172
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:43,020
Will start now.

1173
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,740
Upload it.

1174
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:48,640
Everyone, on your toes.

1175
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:50,530
Timing is everything.

1176
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,200
My name is Selvi.

1177
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,260
And this is my
daughter, Kayalvizhi.

1178
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:58,420
I was able to provide my daughter
education up till 12th grade.

1179
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,030
I couldn't afford
her higher education

1180
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:05,080
I went to Minister Kesavan
Moorthy looking for help.

1181
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:09,270
And that person,
in the pretense of helping us

1182
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:12,160
has destroyed my
daughter's life.

1183
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:15,350
Now my daughter is pregnant.

1184
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,870
Madam, you've accused
Minister Kesavan Moorthy

1185
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,140
do you have any strong
evidence supporting that?

1186
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:22,660
I most definitely have.

1187
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:28,520
the atrocities he did to us,
has been recorded on this phone.

1188
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:30,600
I will hand this
over to you people.

1189
01:15:31,010 --> 01:15:34,350
No matter where we go,
we've been ripped off justice

1190
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:36,850
even the Police are
chasing us away.

1191
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:42,070
If it was your child,
will you people stay quiet about it?

1192
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:44,210
Listen-- don't make
a big deal about it

1193
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,050
It can't be undone now

1194
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:48,910
Come and meet me,
I'll do the needful.

1195
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:53,040
No one should endure what
my family is going through.

1196
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:58,920
Selvi has accused Minister Kesavan
Moorthy of molesting her daughter.

1197
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:01,890
She also have submitted an audio
clip as evidence supporting it.

1198
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,550
This is has created a
commotion among the people.

1199
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:06,820
That's completely a lie.

1200
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:09,670
I have no idea,
who is that girl.

1201
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,530
I've never seen her in my life.

1202
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:16,260
In accordance to this issue,
a strict action has to be taken

1203
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:19,320
Nandha Gopalan Kumaran
of KA-KUM party

1204
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:21,390
has got down to
protest against him.

1205
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:23,040
"Kesavan Moorthy's atrocities!"

1206
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:24,490
"Kesavan Moorthy's atrocities!"

1207
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:26,250
"Injustice to our womanhood"

1208
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:27,670
"Injustice to our womanhood"

1209
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,390
"Kesavan Moorthy should
be hanged till death"

1210
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:30,760
"Kesavan Moorthy should
be hanged till death"

1211
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:34,660
"Arrest Kesavan
Moorthy right away."

1212
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:36,570
"CBI should Investigate him"

1213
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,940
"CBI should Investigate him"

1214
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:39,900
"CBI should Investigate him"

1215
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:41,320
"CBI should Investigate him"

1216
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:42,930
"Injustice to our womanhood"

1217
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:44,590
"Injustice to our womanhood"

1218
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:46,160
"Dismiss him, Dismiss him!"

1219
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:47,670
"Dismiss the ruling party"

1220
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:49,170
"Dismiss the ruling party"

1221
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:50,470
"Dismiss the ruling party"

1222
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,880
"Bloody Sinner"

1223
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:53,050
"Bloody Sinner"

1224
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:54,370
"Kesavan Moorthy
is a bloody sinner"

1225
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,840
"Kesavan Moorthy
is a bloody sinner"

1226
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,590
"Murderer, Murderer!"

1227
01:16:57,630 --> 01:16:58,970
"Murderer, Murderer!"

1228
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:00,710
"Kesavan Moorthy is a murderer."

1229
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:02,530
"Kesavan Moorthy is a murderer."

1230
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:05,130
Vanathi, entire social
media is trending with this.

1231
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:06,660
Emergency meeting is
ongoing among the party.

1232
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:08,210
Damage is done.

1233
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,950
"We'll Wait, We'll Wait"

1234
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:15,520
SP Sir, ignore everything
no matter what goes on.

1235
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:17,380
CM order, just follow the plan.

1236
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:19,620
"Thousands have been murdered."

1237
01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:22,090
"Foreign medicines,
has murdered thousands."

1238
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:25,520

1239
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:28,130
"Foreign medicines,
has murdered thousands."

1240
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:30,690
"Kesavan Moorthy,
should be destroyed."

1241
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,320
"Kesavan Moorthy,
should be dismissed"

1242
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:35,860
"Dismiss him, Dismiss him!"

1243
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:38,020
"Dismiss the ruling party"

1244
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:40,130
Cameras close to Kumaran's face.

1245
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:41,550
Two of them, wide

1246
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:42,620
quickly!

1247
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:45,340
Cam A: Close
Cam B&C: Wide

1248
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,470
"Hang till death,
Hang till death"

1249
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:50,110
"Kesavan Moorthy should
be hanged till death"

1250
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,960
"Dismiss him, Dismiss him!"

1251
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,850
"Dismiss the ruling party"

1252
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:56,400
CHARGE!

1253
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:57,760
"Dismiss him, Dismiss him!"

1254
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:01,280
"Police atrocities, Down! Down!"

1255
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:08,610
"Police atrocities, Down! Down!"

1256
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:11,710
How dare you speak
ill about our Chief?

1257
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:13,780
Bash him, come on beat him up.

1258
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:31,450
Oh no!
Oh my God!

1259
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:34,100
Geetha, please call someone dear

1260
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:35,940
please save my son.

1261
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,830
Listen,
why aren't you doing something?

1262
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:43,560
Nandha Gopalan Kumaran's
protest is trending all over.

1263
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:45,000
Chennai Trend!

1264
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,630
No Vanathi...

1265
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:48,600
...all over India.

1266
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:49,650
Mmmm?

1267
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:56,670
Inform all News channels--

1268
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:57,880
--to focus on Kumaran.

1269
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:59,700
-Vanathi, one second
-Mmmm?

1270
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:05,190
What? What's happening?

1271
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:08,480
Hey-- hey!

1272
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:26,520
Where is it coming from?

1273
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:30,080
this smoke?

1274
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:33,490
It was me who asked
our boys to do it.

1275
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:34,660
Huh!?

1276
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:37,330
Kumara, your plan is great

1277
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,980
but you won't achieve the
reach you're looking for.

1278
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:43,180
People will look at your face
for a while and flip the channel

1279
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:45,600
you will trend on
Twitter and Facebook.

1280
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:47,930
but you'll be forgotten
in couple of days.

1281
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,440
Not enough,
definitely not enough.

1282
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:53,380
Death buddy, death!

1283
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:56,280
Someone has to die.

1284
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:58,480
Only then people
will get interested.

1285
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:03,940
Hey!

1286
01:20:04,270 --> 01:20:05,000
Hey.

1287
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:07,500
Take this and stab
me in the chest.

1288
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:08,990
Then blame it on
the ruling party

1289
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,260
and start crying out loud.

1290
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,950
you cry should
shake up the world.

1291
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,490
Come on, stab me.

1292
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:20,350
Don't think too much

1293
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:23,360
either ways I'm gonna die.

1294
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:25,720
It's better you kill me

1295
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,800
so that I'll rest in peace.

1296
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,410
There's no need for
this freaking promotion.

1297
01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:32,010
Get home, damn it.

1298
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:32,730
Ey-- please don't.

1299
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,350
Ey-- Ey, let go off me.

1300
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,120
-Ey..Ey!
-Listen to me for a moment

1301
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:38,380
Let go off me, damn it.

1302
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,370
Don't let your
struggle go for waste

1303
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,180
Ey-- if I die in this situation

1304
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:43,260
my party will
reward me with money

1305
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:44,650
and ruling party will
provide compensation.

1306
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:48,690
On top of it,
you'll take care of my family for life.

1307
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:50,860
Instead of dying like an
orphan at the hospital

1308
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:53,190
I feel this is a blessing
from the God himself

1309
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:53,720
Ey!

1310
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:55,350
Kumara, please do it

1311
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:57,470
-Ey!
-You'll be doing me a favour

1312
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:00,610
Just shut the hell up.

1313
01:21:00,710 --> 01:21:01,530
Ey...!

1314
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:09,040
Fine-- at least we'll move
forward with the set plan.

1315
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,010
The boys got beaten
up entrusting us

1316
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:15,190
we should do
something in return.

1317
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:19,310
Just hold this knife.

1318
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:25,120
I should call and ask
them to stop the smoke.

1319
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:29,220
Hey...!

1320
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:47,340
It doesn't hurt, buddy.

1321
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:51,230
'cause it's you who did it

1322
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:54,480
I'm at peace now.

1323
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,660
You'll rise up to great heights.

1324
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,290
You'll be really successful.

1325
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:07,760
Take care of my family.

1326
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:09,910
My daughter is very
good at studies.

1327
01:22:10,670 --> 01:22:12,270
Make her pursue IAS.

1328
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,150
Also get her married...

1329
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:49,490
RAJA!

1330
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,180
RAJA!

1331
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:04,930
RAJA!

1332
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:26,260
Minister Kesavan Moorthy
of the ruling party--

1333
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:28,970
--against whom Nandha Gopala
Kumaran staged a protest

1334
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:30,690
a votary member,
Raja was killed.

1335
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:32,690
Following to that,
the Chief of the Party Pichaimuthu

1336
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,700
while returning from the funeral
of his party member Raja

1337
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:38,230
"Raja's loss is quite a
loss to the party as well".

1338
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:42,730
Also stated that his family will be
rewarded with 5 Lacs from the party funds.

1339
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:47,150
Owing to Raja's death which
happened during the protest

1340
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:50,560
Chief Minister Killvazhuvan
has expressed his condolence.

1341
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:56,510
Also has made it clear that the protest
had nothing to do with his party.

1342
01:23:56,710 --> 01:24:00,270
Moreover, Kesavan Moorthy who
brought disgrace to the party

1343
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:05,750
will be dismissed from the post of
Minister, also will be removed the party.

1344
01:24:57,070 --> 01:24:59,970
Come on, move-- give some space.

1345
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:05,220
Come on madam, move aside.

1346
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:27,940
Brother!

1347
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:30,750
High Command,
I have nothing to do with it.

1348
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:33,640
Kumara!

1349
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,760
Just the thought of
you is so overwhelming.

1350
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:41,820
It's really astonishing to see
the crowd gathered for him.

1351
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:44,300
He has bestowed the
party with immense pride.

1352
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:47,380
Come on,
he's the pride of Tamilnadu.

1353
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:49,740
But, could've mentioned
it to us in prior

1354
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:53,600
Your perfume,
is it Versace Special Edition

1355
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:54,920
correct?

1356
01:25:58,410 --> 01:26:01,110
Mmmm-- I've heard
a lot about you.

1357
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:04,500
I meant-- about the perfume.

1358
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:10,460
Vanathi...

1359
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,320
Do you want all
of them together?

1360
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:15,190
Or just Kumaran with our Chief?

1361
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:16,820
Just Kumaran with him.

1362
01:26:17,050 --> 01:26:18,050
Ok, Vanathi.

1363
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,070
Oh...!

1364
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,430
So it's you!

1365
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:25,820
Vananthi!

1366
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:28,750
Vanakkam!

1367
01:26:31,870 --> 01:26:32,870
Vanakkam.

1368
01:26:37,510 --> 01:26:39,010
Mmmm-- sit down.

1369
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:41,020
It's ok.

1370
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,720
you-- you please sit down.

1371
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:03,350
Just like that

1372
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,120
thought of checking on him.

1373
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:11,310
I can see that.

1374
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:14,350
Obviously, you can't resist.

1375
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:18,190
Thanks!

1376
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:23,000
You're always welcome.

1377
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:28,000
The injustice which struck
on my Golden Sword Kumaran

1378
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:32,010
neither I, nor my party will rest
until he's been served with justice.

1379
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:40,680
Fantastic!

1380
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,080
Amazing!

1381
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:45,160
My beloved,
who brought laurels to our party

1382
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:46,960
An Inferno

1383
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:49,700
who fights for justice
like a warrior.

1384
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:51,640
You're my backbone

1385
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:55,580
It's an honor to be around you.

1386
01:27:56,780 --> 01:28:00,810
I pray to the God,
for your long life.

1387
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:04,810
We'll meet,
once you've recovered.

1388
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:09,870
Sir, one minute...excuse me, Sir.

1389
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:11,680
How is he doing now?

1390
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:14,400
I'm leaving too.

1391
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:17,440
Vanakkam!

1392
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,770
You're so sweet and simple.

1393
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:23,990
Vanakkam.

1394
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:29,800
Pandit, bring the car.

1395
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:42,420
Mmmm-- can't deny
the fact though

1396
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:44,970
she is very beautiful.

1397
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:47,470
Bombshell!

1398
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:51,670
May be to impress,
this is what required.

1399
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:54,000
Gym, diet control

1400
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:55,820
I think the women of her stature

1401
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:58,340
always on to the married men.

1402
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:02,250
The husbands have
no control though

1403
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:07,220
wonder how they live with it?

1404
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:09,160
I can't be so shameless.

1405
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:21,610
Has everything been
completed as per his plan?

1406
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:24,600
How come he was aware of it?

1407
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:26,500
I knew about it

1408
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:29,350
or it's you people
who knew about it

1409
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:31,480
Sir, I swear on my mother

1410
01:29:31,550 --> 01:29:32,730
who is not alive anymore

1411
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:36,120
Sir, my post as Chief
Secretary post is by your grace

1412
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:40,000
just 'cause my wife
spoke ill about you

1413
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:42,640
I never spoke to her for a year

1414
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,750
and I've been here
along with you...

1415
01:29:45,470 --> 01:29:47,250
...you're well aware of it, Sir.

1416
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:53,010
Sir

1417
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:57,060
one detail from his background
has been pricking me

1418
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:58,600
Spit it out!

1419
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:03,410
During childhood, he used to spend
the holidays at his father's camp.

1420
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:06,460
That streak continued until
his father retired from Army.

1421
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,790
So, that could be
one of the reason...

1422
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:12,380
My Dad used to sell stash--

1423
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,280
--stop with the nonsense.

1424
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:20,230
A-Team!

01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:38,820
Vanathi...

1601
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:40,540
...herself is well aware of.

1602
01:47:40,730 --> 01:47:42,020
Repeat that again

1603
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:45,800
my name...

1604
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:48,270
Vanathi!

1605
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,070
Then--

1606
01:47:53,890 --> 01:47:55,070
--Kumaran, Sir.

1607
01:47:56,190 --> 01:47:58,190
Finally achieved what
you intended to do.

1608
01:48:00,710 --> 01:48:02,840
From being an ordinary
votary of the party

1609
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:04,520
I've become a fool, madam.

1610
01:48:05,550 --> 01:48:08,870
You've made everyone
your enemy now.

1611
01:48:09,130 --> 01:48:11,820
Hereafter,
your days are numbered

1612
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:13,730
expecting your death.

1613
01:48:13,870 --> 01:48:16,620
You won't believe,
what I have to say

1614
01:48:16,990 --> 01:48:18,990
during last night, death...

1615
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:22,410
...here,
I was this close with an encounter

1616
01:48:30,770 --> 01:48:32,150
That's the truth.

1617
01:48:34,650 --> 01:48:36,070
What else do you expect?

1618
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:39,260
It's not only you,
who is looking to change the system.

1619
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:41,150
We too...

1620
01:48:44,870 --> 01:48:48,090
But not everyone can
fight death like you do.

1621
01:48:48,970 --> 01:48:52,630
So it's better to shut up
and mind your own business.

1622
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:56,440
Mmmm-- don't you see me exist?

1623
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:01,810
Pretending to be blind,
when you can see.

1624
01:49:02,990 --> 01:49:04,990
So, surrender!

1625
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:08,200
Instead of getting myself
destroyed doing good

1626
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:10,170
I became one among the public.

1627
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,770
Look, I'm at peace now.

1628
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:16,210
I've got wealth, properties

1629
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:17,890
moreover you're there too.

1630
01:49:18,950 --> 01:49:20,330
That's enough for me.

1631
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:23,250
What?

1632
01:49:24,210 --> 01:49:25,840
Amongst everything...

1633
01:49:26,230 --> 01:49:27,550
...you added me to your list.

1634
01:49:35,150 --> 01:49:39,060
Just 2 seconds,
the power will be back.

1635
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:41,380
Five Star Hotel.

1636
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:44,940
Poor thing,
you must've not experienced it.

1637
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:49,000
Instead of getting tortured
by the light of a candle

1638
01:49:49,150 --> 01:49:50,510
this is heaven compared to it.

1639
01:49:56,980 --> 01:49:59,470
So, you mean to say
candle is my wife--

1640
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:01,630
--and you're the
Five Star Hotel.

1641
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:04,510
Wow, what a punchline.

1642
01:50:14,980 --> 01:50:15,980
It's too dark.

1643
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:18,860
Hey!

1644
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:20,540
It's the mirror...

1645
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:23,350
-Oh...Oh!
-What are you looking for?

1646
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:29,130
Nothing, I came by Govt. Bus

1647
01:50:29,370 --> 01:50:31,150
I've been stinking due to that.

1648
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:32,330
I gotta shower.

1649
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:35,330
But I can't seem to find a door.

1650
01:50:35,730 --> 01:50:38,190
Even the shower is
surrounded with glass

1651
01:50:41,070 --> 01:50:42,070
This...

1652
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:44,960
Five Star Hotel.

1653
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:46,400

01:55:37,510 --> 01:55:39,890
So, you came for this
pretending to meet me.

1690
01:55:40,850 --> 01:55:42,480
I'm just asking,
'cause I met you.

1691
01:55:42,860 --> 01:55:45,610
It's up to you,
to give one or not.

1692
01:55:48,180 --> 01:55:49,180
Sit down.

1693
01:55:50,150 --> 01:55:53,360
You know it very well,
that I can't say no to you.

1694
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:55,490
You've been manipulating
me with that.

1695
01:55:58,180 --> 01:55:59,790
You want to become an MLA.

1696
01:56:01,930 --> 01:56:06,160
Fine, your popularity is ok.

1697
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:09,540
a face well known
to the constituency.

1698
01:56:10,790 --> 01:56:13,260
Got an image of a kind person.

1699
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:16,500
But what about money?

1700
01:56:17,260 --> 01:56:17,930
Huh!?

1701
01:56:18,510 --> 01:56:20,810
Can you win?
If you've been given a seat to contest?

1702
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:23,020
Don't you need money for that?

1703
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:25,220
That too in millions.

1704
01:56:25,610 --> 01:56:28,370
Ground work,
publicity materials, coverage

1705
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:32,180
on top of all,
every vote should be bought

1706
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:33,990
public will demand though.

1707
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:37,640
This is the reason,
millions are being swindled

1708
01:56:37,810 --> 01:56:39,780
to spend on Elections.

1709
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:42,150
No!

1710
01:56:42,490 --> 01:56:45,790
We don't use even a cent of
our money during elections.

1711
01:56:46,570 --> 01:56:47,400
Then?

1712
01:56:53,380 --> 01:56:54,390
Party

1713
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:55,730
Leaders

1714
01:56:56,030 --> 01:56:57,720
who is strong politically

1715
01:56:58,030 --> 01:57:00,030
in spite of these
being the factors

1716
01:57:00,630 --> 01:57:03,030
do you know who are
the real "Kingmakers"?

1717
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:05,210
these Corporate companies.

1718
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:06,210
Understood!?

1719
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:07,540
Them...

1720
01:57:07,970 --> 01:57:10,510
I mean, the corporate companies

1721
01:57:10,830 --> 01:57:12,640
can you arrange a
meeting with them?

1722
01:57:13,210 --> 01:57:14,100
meeting!

1723
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:16,170
Just one meeting.

1724
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:31,910
This is our first
pre-election party meet.

1725
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:35,120
Pandiya, make sure it
should be a memorable one.

1726
01:57:35,350 --> 01:57:37,730
-Hope you understood?
-Sure, High Command.

1727
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:45,160
Brother, I don't understand.

1728
01:57:45,620 --> 01:57:47,340
I don't understand the
need of this ceremony.

1729
01:57:48,380 --> 01:57:49,870
That too High Command
is coming for it.

1730
01:57:51,090 --> 01:57:52,590
Pandian is pissed at me

1731
01:57:53,910 --> 01:57:55,560
party members are
laughing at him.

1732
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:59,060
Stating, if the seat will
be given to him or Kumaran.

1733
01:58:01,060 --> 01:58:02,810
His intentions are not right.

1734
01:58:04,270 --> 01:58:06,010
Tell me,
what exactly I did wrong?

1735
01:58:06,490 --> 01:58:08,560
Am I not doing this for
the sake of our party?

1736
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:13,480
Son,
you've become a big shot now.

1737
01:58:14,690 --> 01:58:16,910
CM himself is scared of you

1738
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:19,540
you're well aware of everything.

1739
01:58:20,870 --> 01:58:23,520
Don't be toying around with me.

1740
01:58:23,810 --> 01:58:25,060
I beg of you.

1741
01:58:25,130 --> 01:58:27,040
"The reason,
why I took shelter in this Ashram

1742
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:28,520
that's not right

1743
01:58:28,730 --> 01:58:30,220
That isn't Classical Tamizh.

1744
01:58:30,330 --> 01:58:31,610
doesn't strike the note

1745
01:58:31,890 --> 01:58:34,350
Son, what are you doing?

1746
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:38,650
They're asking me to
speak at this meeting.

1747
01:58:39,210 --> 01:58:41,620
I can't speak with such diction.

1748
01:58:41,950 --> 01:58:44,440
Why don't say something,
let's see how it is.

1749
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:47,180
First roll up your mustache.

1750
01:58:52,820 --> 01:58:55,540
Brother...
My name is, Kumaran!

1751
01:58:56,090 --> 01:58:57,740
I have another name too

1752
01:58:58,060 --> 01:59:01,000
Are you mimicking 'Baasha"?

1753
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:06,200
That's right,
not sure if I have to churn punchlines

1754
01:59:07,610 --> 01:59:08,570
or...

1755
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:13,220
If you speak in this manner,
people won't agree with you.

1756
01:59:13,410 --> 01:59:14,160
Why?

1757
01:59:14,770 --> 01:59:17,540
They do enjoy and appreciate
the same in Cinema.

1758
01:59:19,130 --> 01:59:21,030
Cinema and Politics
are not the same.

1759
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:23,270
Think from people's perspective

1760
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:25,480
witnessing a Hero in Cinema

1761
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:27,950
and a Leader who will
govern them for 5 years,

1762
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:29,150
both have a vast difference.

1763
01:59:31,790 --> 01:59:33,340
I totally get it,
what you're saying

1764
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,320
But I can't speak
in classical Tamizh.

1765
01:59:36,650 --> 01:59:38,910
Why do you want to speak
in classical Tamizh?

1766
01:59:39,330 --> 01:59:41,450
Whatever comes to your
mind at that moment--

1767
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:42,810
--just churn them out.

1768
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:45,240
No matter what you do,
make sure it's your own.

1769
01:59:45,710 --> 01:59:47,950
You gotta create a
style of your own.

1770
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:50,190
Attitude,
dressing sense and virtue

1771
01:59:50,350 --> 01:59:52,240
also your speech should
stand out from the crowd.

1772
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:55,940
Once you're on stage,
people should be mesmerized by you.

1773
01:59:56,640 --> 01:59:59,290
They should never
feel bored of you.

1774
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:05,040
Fine!

1775
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:06,780
You stay outside.

1776
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:09,130
I'll...

1777
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:15,990
Brother,
you left just 'cause I said so?

1778
02:00:16,150 --> 02:00:20,910
Son, you've gone beyond
the stage to be questioned.

1779
02:00:21,410 --> 02:00:23,600
Your wish is my command.

1780
02:00:24,030 --> 02:00:25,690
I'm like your elder brother

1781
02:00:26,950 --> 02:00:29,580
it's better for
me to be enslaved.

1782
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:33,170
Oh God, no.

1783
02:00:36,590 --> 02:00:40,340
Son, unintentionally
I blurted it out

1784
02:00:40,790 --> 02:00:43,320
that I'm your elder
brother, please forgive me.

1785
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:44,910
Ey...Ey!

1786
02:00:45,110 --> 02:00:47,670
Come on brother,
you have every right.

1787
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:50,210
If it's not for you--

1788
02:00:51,090 --> 02:00:52,970
--Kumaran is always
very grateful.

1789
02:00:53,950 --> 02:00:55,200
But still, Giri

1790
02:00:56,380 --> 02:01:00,280
don't repeat that mistake.

1791
02:01:01,310 --> 02:01:04,450
It's fine now,
as we're alone in here.

1792
02:01:06,770 --> 02:01:08,220
But in front of the people

1793
02:01:09,910 --> 02:01:11,120
it won't look good.

1794
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:08,280
Everything is weird, Vanathi.

1795
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:11,850
So far, they've not
given us any information.

1796
02:02:12,180 --> 02:02:13,740
They just stare
when you ask them.

1797
02:02:16,690 --> 02:02:19,490
Kumaran,
I'm not sure what they've planned.

1798
02:02:20,940 --> 02:02:21,740
Please!

1799
02:02:22,690 --> 02:02:23,740
Please be careful.

1800
02:02:23,990 --> 02:02:25,500
I don't know what else to say.

1801
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:26,930
Something is wrong.

1802
02:02:27,590 --> 02:02:29,500
On behalf of KMK Political Party

1803
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:33,700
at Srivallputtur, an appreciation ceremony
for Nandha Gopalan Kumaran is being held

1804
02:02:33,910 --> 02:02:39,290
Also there's an expectation that
he'll be given a post in the party.

1805
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,990
Ey-- what is it?

1806
02:02:42,490 --> 02:02:44,290
How long are you planning
to sit like this?

1807
02:02:44,670 --> 02:02:46,030
Looks like you've
been possessed.

1808
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:49,060
You're not even
answering my questions.

1809
02:02:49,930 --> 02:02:51,100
It's getting late.

1810
02:02:51,640 --> 02:02:54,070
Don't you have to
be at that Ceremony?

1811
02:02:56,380 --> 02:02:58,800
I was just thinking about
it, and you said it.

1812
02:02:59,190 --> 02:03:00,740
Isn't that a ceremony
to appreciate him?

1813
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:03,320
It won't look good,
if he's late for it.

1814
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:07,030
What is it?

1815
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:10,250
Come on get up and change.

1816
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:13,610
Mother-in-Law, how do I look?

1817
02:03:15,010 --> 02:03:16,940
Geetha Kumari!

1818
02:03:17,160 --> 02:03:19,690
Wife of the stupendous Kumaran.

1819
02:03:23,290 --> 02:03:24,520
Namesake though...

1820
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:26,700
Dear!

1821
02:03:27,890 --> 02:03:32,180
When you speak like
that, it hurts dear.

1822
02:03:33,710 --> 02:03:36,010
Just 'cause those
party men invited

1823
02:03:36,410 --> 02:03:38,410
you're not obligated to go.

1824
02:03:38,980 --> 02:03:41,250
Ma, how can you be
so irresponsible?

1825
02:03:41,770 --> 02:03:46,390
On stage,
I should be beside him as his wife

1826
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:50,770
Obviously, his mistress can't

1827
02:03:50,980 --> 02:03:52,900
think about it mother-in-law.

1828
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:55,840
Oh no! Oh no!

1829
02:03:56,020 --> 02:03:58,470
what if tomorrow,
our family image...

1830
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:03,250
You're too innocent,
mother-in-law.

1831
02:04:16,090 --> 02:04:17,910
Take a good look at my face.

1832
02:04:20,950 --> 02:04:22,970
Come on,
listen to what I have to say.

1833
02:04:23,320 --> 02:04:24,870
Take a good look at my face.

1834
02:04:27,590 --> 02:04:29,110
'Cause after today,
you won't be able to.

1835
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:32,680
Get lost, idiot.

1836
02:04:52,510 --> 02:04:53,860
My dear Geetha,

1837
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:57,050
sweetheart, my life

1838
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:04,910
Geetha, you too take a
good look at my face.

1839
02:05:07,470 --> 02:05:09,950
Hey, don't mess around
with my daughter.

1840
02:05:16,820 --> 02:05:19,800
Dad, even you take a
good look at my face.

1841
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:25,620
I did give you guys a chance.

1842
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:27,510
Rest is up to you people.

1843
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:31,240
Later,
you people will regret it.

1844
02:05:34,930 --> 02:05:36,150
Let's go dear...

1845
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,720
...Geetha Kumari!

1846
02:05:48,700 --> 02:05:50,700
Boss, I've spoken to Kumaran--

1847
02:05:50,820 --> 02:05:52,320
--he'll be here sharp at 7pm.

1848
02:05:52,430 --> 02:05:54,400
We're all set for his welcome.

1849
02:05:56,780 --> 02:05:58,140
Why are we riding on a cycle?

1850
02:05:58,350 --> 02:06:00,070
Oh, to make an impression?

1851
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:01,920
Fine, speak no more.

1852
02:06:07,620 --> 02:06:10,110
You look really beautiful
under this moonlight.

1853
02:06:10,820 --> 02:06:14,660
How is it possible to romance
two women at the same time?

1854
02:06:18,120 --> 02:06:19,370
Keep your eyes on the road.

1855
02:06:20,740 --> 02:06:21,830
Wonder when you'll believe me?

1856
02:06:21,970 --> 02:06:23,110
Please trust your husband.

1857
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:25,150
To advice,
first you should live that.

1858
02:06:25,590 --> 02:06:27,700
'He's heading towards
the market with his wife.'

1859
02:06:34,030 --> 02:06:34,980
Sir!

1860
02:06:35,530 --> 02:06:38,570
How do we prepare ourselves,
without any information?

1861
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,040
Mmmm-- not today dear

1862
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:44,770
We three usually never get
together to do something

1863
02:06:45,190 --> 02:06:47,400
and during that time,
we don't trust anyone.

1864
02:06:48,250 --> 02:06:50,110
Let everything be within us.

1865
02:06:50,710 --> 02:06:52,350
It's enough if you do your job.

1866
02:06:56,690 --> 02:06:57,880
Ey-- go around

1867
02:06:57,950 --> 02:06:59,040
go through the market

1868
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:00,060
come on, go around.

1869
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:01,890
Can't you see he's
yelling at us?

1870
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:03,640
Go through the market.

1871
02:07:04,010 --> 02:07:05,590
Come on, keep moving.

1872
02:07:06,070 --> 02:07:06,990
Stop staring and leave.

1873
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:08,180
Come on, we're getting late.

1874
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:09,890
Get lost!

1875
02:07:12,010 --> 02:07:14,370
Come on,
everyone leave from here.

1876
02:07:51,590 --> 02:07:52,510
What happened?

1877
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:10,510
Pandit, get the car

1878
02:11:10,620 --> 02:11:11,680
let's take her to the hospital.

1879
02:11:11,780 --> 02:11:12,780
-Fast!
-Ok, Vanathi.

1880
02:11:13,730 --> 02:11:15,730
This is the current
situation of this country.

1881
02:11:17,190 --> 02:11:19,190
A proof of Chief Minister's
atrocious Government.

1882
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:21,550
They don't care for the
welfare of the people.

1883
02:11:21,790 --> 02:11:25,890
A stubborn Govt. hungry for position
and will die holding on to it.

1884
02:11:26,620 --> 02:11:28,460
I'm an ordinary votary,
who questioned them

1885
02:11:29,210 --> 02:11:31,510
look at the state
of the youngster.

1886
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:34,870
Looking at the love
the public have on me

1887
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:37,430
they were scared I will
take over the position

1888
02:11:37,580 --> 02:11:39,830
they conspired to kill
me on my way over here.

1889
02:11:40,670 --> 02:11:42,410
The knives which charged
towards me to kill

1890
02:11:44,490 --> 02:11:45,950
took a stab at my wife

1891
02:11:50,210 --> 02:11:52,890
that's how they getaway with
their political tactics.

1892
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:55,340
And you people
shamelessly vote for them.

1893
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:04,610
Respected Ladies and Gentlemen

1894
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:08,370
also the gathered
battalion of youth

1895
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:09,540
Vanakkam!

1896
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:11,920
Be patient, we'll still have
the last weapon to draw.

1897
02:12:35,450 --> 02:12:36,250
I--

1898
02:12:36,630 --> 02:12:38,330
I just have one doubt

1899
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:40,240
shall I ask?

1900
02:12:41,960 --> 02:12:43,340
Hope you won't get offended?

1901
02:12:45,060 --> 02:12:48,140
Why is it always you people
need a nudge for everything?

1902
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:52,600
Why do you endure this nonsense,
and continue to be slaves?

1903
02:12:53,300 --> 02:12:55,230
They're literally butchering us.

1904
02:12:55,740 --> 02:12:58,830
But you people don't
seem to bother at all.

1905
02:13:01,900 --> 02:13:03,460
You don't have to
give me a reason

1906
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:05,460
I'm well aware of it.

1907
02:13:07,260 --> 02:13:08,460
Fear!

1908
02:13:09,860 --> 02:13:11,750
We've been threatened
in every manner.

1909
02:13:12,720 --> 02:13:14,970
Over the time and generations.

1910
02:13:15,260 --> 02:13:17,150
We're so used to being slaves.

1911
02:13:17,780 --> 02:13:19,830
If suddenly asked,
you people find it hard to change.

1912
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:26,270
We didn't use guns to
attain our Independence.

1913
02:13:27,700 --> 02:13:29,510
Gandhiji knew it well

1914
02:13:30,110 --> 02:13:31,450
he must've thought of it

1915
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:34,010
"Come on--

1916
02:13:34,510 --> 02:13:35,980
--let's pick up our weapons
and take back our freedom"

1917
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:37,530
if so no one would've showed up.

1918
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:40,760
Let's walk, sit,
get hit or kicked

1919
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:42,220
let's go on fast

1920
02:13:42,980 --> 02:13:44,760
these cowards deserve
only this method

1921
02:13:44,810 --> 02:13:46,640
and he knew it back then.

1922
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:50,370
Since then, we've never changed.

1923
02:13:51,690 --> 02:13:53,090
What is the maximum we would do?

1924
02:13:54,130 --> 02:13:55,620
Even if we are struck by Tsunami

1925
02:13:55,970 --> 02:13:56,970
Phew!

1926
02:13:57,320 --> 02:13:58,790
nothing happened to my family.

1927
02:13:59,980 --> 02:14:01,150
Fine, let's take the TV

1928
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:03,200
when we witness others die

1929
02:14:04,900 --> 02:14:06,260
pity is all we offer

1930
02:14:06,580 --> 02:14:09,320
"Oh no, so many are dead"

1931
02:14:10,010 --> 02:14:12,790
"Damn, scams are never ending"

1932
02:14:13,690 --> 02:14:14,460
What!?

1933
02:14:15,220 --> 02:14:18,660
"A child was raped and killed."

1934
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:22,240
The next day,
we'll stuff idlis in our mouth

1935
02:14:22,380 --> 02:14:25,010
pick up our bags
and head to work.

1936
02:14:25,650 --> 02:14:29,390
In spite of everything, if someone
gets down to fight for Independence

1937
02:14:30,010 --> 02:14:33,340
Put a post on Facebook
and attract likes.

1938
02:14:34,990 --> 02:14:37,640
Did they get arrested?
Have they been imprisoned?

1939
02:14:37,890 --> 02:14:40,980
come on, post 10 comments
on whatsapp group.

1940
02:14:42,990 --> 02:14:45,260
Have we done anything different?

1941
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:51,960
Who are you to question this?

1942
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:54,510
What right do you
have to question?

1943
02:14:57,990 --> 02:14:59,500
I have all the rights.

1944
02:15:00,550 --> 02:15:04,020
Farmers who have shed blood
and sweat on this land.

1945
02:15:04,490 --> 02:15:07,310
Workers who are driven for the
development of this nation.

1946
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:11,440
Being a citizen of India,
that's more than enough

1947
02:15:11,740 --> 02:15:13,810
you have every right to
question, The System!

1948
02:15:16,430 --> 02:15:20,120
Firstly the ones,
who don't follow the traffic lights

1949
02:15:20,410 --> 02:15:22,000
they still jump the
signal with ignorance

1950
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:24,390
If we ask, they say "Attitude"

1951
02:15:25,170 --> 02:15:28,780
Just hold them tight and
lash them with a whip.

1952
02:15:29,730 --> 02:15:30,480
"Oh God, no!"

1953
02:15:30,650 --> 02:15:33,000
Then they'll stop
right at the signal.

1954
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:36,730
Let's raise our current
generation with such discipline.

1955
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:40,420
Which will nurture the
upcoming generation naturally.

1956
02:15:40,860 --> 02:15:41,830
Next...

1957
02:16:37,330 --> 02:16:38,240
They've...

1958
02:16:43,750 --> 02:16:44,480
Dad...

1959
02:16:52,650 --> 02:16:54,580
a while ago

1960
02:16:56,300 --> 02:16:57,920
my parents

1961
02:17:00,300 --> 02:17:05,010
were burnt alive,
while they were inside the house.

1962
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:10,100
inside the house

1963
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:16,600
My parents--

1964
02:17:18,950 --> 02:17:20,680
--sitting there as corpses.

1965
02:17:32,070 --> 02:17:33,550
Was it the ruling party?

1966
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:36,600
or was it my own party?

1967
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:40,010
Killivazhuvan?

1968
02:17:41,580 --> 02:17:43,000
or is it Pichaimuthu?

1969
02:18:00,720 --> 02:18:07,330
[RAGING CROWD]

1970
02:18:22,810 --> 02:18:24,170
Pichai! Pichai!

1971
02:18:25,010 --> 02:18:27,160
Ey-- Start the caravan.

1972
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:39,850
The fire we started
is haunting us back

1973
02:18:39,970 --> 02:18:40,770
Ey...!

1974
02:18:42,780 --> 02:18:44,300
Oh God, no!

1975
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:50,300
Fire!

1976
02:18:50,460 --> 02:18:52,470
Ey-- Ey, it's burning, it's hot.

1977
02:18:54,250 --> 02:18:55,750
-Brother!
-Mmmm

1978
02:18:55,980 --> 02:18:57,230
Please wear your Veshti.

1979
02:19:03,260 --> 02:19:06,170
That's really not
important right now.

1980
02:19:06,460 --> 02:19:09,390
Brother, a Tamizhan should
never lose his pride.

1981
02:19:10,940 --> 02:19:12,480
-End of the day...
-You're right!

1982
02:19:12,590 --> 02:19:14,630
...this stage doesn't belong
to any Political party.

1983
02:19:14,830 --> 02:19:16,320
-It's our party
-Let's decide together.

1984
02:19:16,580 --> 02:19:17,960
This party belongs to people.

1985
02:19:18,170 --> 02:19:20,760
Makkal Munnetram Kazhagam
[People's Development Foundation]

1986
02:19:21,210 --> 02:19:23,530
MMK!

1987
02:19:35,780 --> 02:19:37,070
On behalf of Kaka
Munnetram Kazhagam

1988
02:19:37,190 --> 02:19:39,740
the rewarding ceremony which
took place in Srivalliputtur

1989
02:19:39,880 --> 02:19:40,980
the party members

1990
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:42,780
attacked the party
leader, Pichaimuthu

1991
02:19:42,950 --> 02:19:45,950
and his associates
Sahayam and Ramamurthy

1992
02:19:46,110 --> 02:19:47,480
and burnt them alive,

1993
02:19:47,580 --> 02:19:50,120
has created a sensation
across the Nation.

1994
02:19:50,300 --> 02:19:53,920
meanwhile,
parents of Nandha Gopala Kumaran...

1995
02:20:07,180 --> 02:20:08,280
She's alright!

1996
02:20:12,790 --> 02:20:15,260
Vanathi, what's your next move?

1997
02:20:18,910 --> 02:20:23,040
See, your future and relationship
with Kumaran is like...

1998
02:20:26,100 --> 02:20:27,670
Some relationships are

1999
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:30,170
can't be explained...

2000
02:20:32,400 --> 02:20:34,700
Savor them until they last.

2001
02:20:36,100 --> 02:20:37,530
I thought of something

2002
02:20:38,220 --> 02:20:39,330
but Kumaran

2003
02:20:40,950 --> 02:20:43,210
now we have to see what
he's got on his mind.

2004
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:17,640
Few months later...

2005
02:21:24,420 --> 02:21:25,830
Last week the
Election Commission

2006
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:28,780
announced the dates for
Tamilnadu elections.

2007
02:21:28,950 --> 02:21:32,330
The two political parties from
Tamilnadu, KMK and CJK

2008
02:21:32,470 --> 02:21:34,830
announced their status on
alliance with other parties.

2009
02:21:35,030 --> 02:21:39,920
Tomorrow there will be a press meet
with Nadha Gopalan Kumaran of MMK

2010
02:21:40,060 --> 02:21:43,900
we can expect some important
political decisions to be discussed.

2011
02:21:44,080 --> 02:21:45,960
Moreover Nandha Gopalan Kumaran...

2012
02:21:51,110 --> 02:21:53,330
After the sympathetic
death of Chief Pichai--

2013
02:21:53,400 --> 02:21:54,990
the entire army of
the party members

2014
02:21:55,130 --> 02:21:56,040
after discussing

2015
02:21:56,140 --> 02:21:59,640
have requested you to take up the
responsibility of being the chief of KMK.

2016
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:01,260
What's your take on that?

2017
02:22:01,640 --> 02:22:03,640
If the situation calls for--

2018
02:22:04,330 --> 02:22:05,640
--I can't stop that
from happening.

2019
02:22:07,240 --> 02:22:10,360
No matter what,
I was born and bred in that party.

2020
02:22:14,150 --> 02:22:17,700
In order to save the party
from a treacherous Ruling party

2021
02:22:18,490 --> 02:22:21,240
most importantly
to save our country

2022
02:22:23,360 --> 02:22:24,550
this is the prominent
way to do it.

2023
02:22:24,780 --> 02:22:26,070
Can we take it as a yes?

2024
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:32,860
"Kumaran is present,
wherever the votary are..."

2025
02:22:34,930 --> 02:22:40,320
Even if the votary from MMK are
supporting Nandha Gopalan Kumaran

2026
02:22:40,450 --> 02:22:42,380
there has been few
oppositions too.

2027
02:22:42,430 --> 02:22:44,020
Let's get to the
debate on this topic.

2028
02:22:44,220 --> 02:22:45,470
Manoj is my friend

2029
02:22:45,560 --> 02:22:48,370
he was working in a IT company
with good salary and posting.

2030
02:22:48,500 --> 02:22:50,020
Once he started his party--

2031
02:22:50,060 --> 02:22:52,530
--hoping he will bring
the change in the society

2032
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:54,470
and there will be
progress in peoples lives.

2033
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:57,010
Trusting him,
quit his job and joined the party.

2034
02:22:57,130 --> 02:23:01,810
But he didn't bother and
jumped over to the other party.

2035
02:23:01,980 --> 02:23:07,450
What does Kumaran has to say for those
1000's of youngsters who believed in him?

2036
02:23:07,530 --> 02:23:09,000
The answer is
nothing but reality.

2037
02:23:09,630 --> 02:23:11,310
If you look at the reality--

2038
02:23:11,380 --> 02:23:14,820
--only two parties in Tamilnadu are
bound to contest in the elections

2039
02:23:14,950 --> 02:23:15,870
that's the truth

2040
02:23:15,990 --> 02:23:18,120
no other party can
come into power.

2041
02:23:18,610 --> 02:23:21,100
So, Kumaran's decision--

2042
02:23:21,320 --> 02:23:23,160
--shows that he's
a practical person

2043
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:23,970
that's the right thing.

2044
02:23:24,050 --> 02:23:26,740
You're right, Sir.
This is an intense Political game.

2045
02:23:26,970 --> 02:23:29,610
KMK was established
100 years ago

2046
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:32,020
they've been in
power for 7 times.

2047
02:23:32,180 --> 02:23:35,890
Kumaran taking up the
responsibilities in such a party

2048
02:23:35,950 --> 02:23:37,040
for that party

2049
02:23:37,190 --> 02:23:40,180
and for Kumaran,
it paved an opportunity for a huge win.

2050
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:01,500
Just like I mentioned earlier

2051
02:24:02,770 --> 02:24:04,360
My name is Nandha
Gopalan Kumaran

2052
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:07,250
people call me as NGK.

2053
02:24:07,730 --> 02:24:08,980
Vanakkam, CM Sir.

2054
02:24:09,190 --> 02:24:12,000
Firstly, congratulations
on behalf of our channel.

2055
02:24:12,870 --> 02:24:14,300
First question for you

2056
02:24:14,810 --> 02:24:16,190
to be honest

2057
02:24:16,580 --> 02:24:19,400
our channel has
criticized you profusely

2058
02:24:19,780 --> 02:24:21,330
why did you come forward to
us for the first interview?

2059
02:24:22,280 --> 02:24:23,720
To set an example.

2060
02:24:25,190 --> 02:24:27,720
I'm not the person,
who feels happy with praises.

2061
02:24:28,730 --> 02:24:31,110
But the person who corrects
his mistakes from criticism.

2062
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:34,000
You've formed the
party on an alliance.

2063
02:24:34,190 --> 02:24:35,510
Do you think it will sustain?

2064
02:24:35,890 --> 02:24:37,220
Life is all about believing.

2065
02:24:38,220 --> 02:24:40,360
My notion to do
good for the people

2066
02:24:40,890 --> 02:24:42,350
there will be always
support for that.

2067
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:48,260
If not, I'm ready to
face another election.

2068
02:24:48,690 --> 02:24:51,490
Personally the love you
have from the people

2069
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:53,440
also the leadership of KMK party

2070
02:24:53,700 --> 02:24:56,870
still without absolute
majority, 95 seats

2071
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:58,210
Your opinion about that?

2072
02:24:58,950 --> 02:25:00,100
I will learn.

2073
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:01,840
I didn't get it.

2074
02:25:04,270 --> 02:25:05,270
I will learn.

2075
02:25:10,620 --> 02:25:13,100
N.G.K
Will Rule!
