1
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,041
Massage my shoulders too.

2
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,541
Sister, Farida,
I am going to be a mother-in-law.

3
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:57,500
That's why I don't
have the time to breathe.

4
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,083
Samira.

5
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,000
Come here. Come here.

6
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:01,958
Give me sweets.

7
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,083
What design are you making?

8
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,291
Make a 'pasley.'

9
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,458
Sheheryar is coming too, isn't he?
- Mother!

10
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:13,083
Ask aunt Farida whether Sheheryar
has spoken to Karishma Chaudhry or not.

11
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,291
I even mentioned
Karishma on the facebook invite.

12
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,083
You have expectations from Sheheryar?
- You are absolutely correct, sister Farida.

13
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,041
You can forget about
Karishma Chaudhry coming now.

14
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,458
Sheheryar is an nice child.

15
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:28,875
Find a nice girl and
get him married quickly.

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,875
Then see what he does.
- Mother.

17
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,416
Why do you want to
ruin some girl's life?

18
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:38,125
He is a commitment-phobe who
only breaks hearts and does nothing else.

19
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,666
Tell Sheheryar Natasha is eagerly
waiting for Karishma Chaudhry.

20
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:45,083
Yes, I will tell him. Okay.

21
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,583
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

22
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,833
This is such a hassle!

23
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:52,166
Why do we have to suffer if
Sheheryar wants to live in this filth?

24
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,666
He is just a child.

25
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,958
Don't be so mean?

26
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,416
Take this. Take it. Take this too.

27
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,791
Take this too.
Take everything. Just spare us. Please.

28
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,416
I won't give you this ring.
It is for Sheheryar's bride.

29
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,416
What are you doing mother?

30
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:09,916
You are calling me mother..

31
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,833
..And yet you rob your family as well?

32
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,041
Your sari.
- No!

33
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,541
I don't want it.
It is stuck in the door.

34
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:18,791
Oh!

35
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:19,916
I see.

36
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,666
Thank you. Thanks. I thought..

37
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:23,833
You misunderstood.

38
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,541
I am a target myself, aunty.
I'm not a killer.

39
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,166
Damn!

40
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,708
I am on vacations!

41
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:48,791
Climb up.

42
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:52,916
Grandma, take the stairs.
This lift won't come.

43
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,291
Do I look like a grandma to you?

44
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:58,416
If you wait for the lift
you will become a great grandma.

45
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,416
Bad brought up!

46
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,333
You brought disgrace on me.

47
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,708
What will happen to this
sin that's growing in my womb?

48
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,041
Sin?

49
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,041
Cheat!

50
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:28,916
Traitor!

51
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,958
I will kill you as well as this sin.

52
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:33,666
Seema!

53
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,583
Seema, I..

54
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,666
I am helpless, Seema.

55
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,708
Please treat it as
a youthful mistake and..

56
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,041
I will not spare you.

57
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:47,833
I will go to your mother..

58
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,458
..And thrust this sin into her arms.

59
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,958
In my arms? No.

60
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:53,708
Cut!

61
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,708
If this had been Sangeeta's
set this sound would not be heard.

62
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:58,791
Your mother.

63
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,791
Why are you insulting?
- I am not insulting.

64
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,041
Mother. Hashtag, your mom. Outside.

65
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,333
It's a raid!
- Aunty is here.

66
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:06,416
Wow!

67
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,041
Aunty is here?

68
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,541
Mummy will come in and make a noise.

69
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,958
I am doomed because of you.
Who put my boxers on the chair?

70
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:18,666
Who is there?

71
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:19,541
Aunty!

72
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,666
Where is she?

73
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,916
Where is she?
- Who?

74
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,291
Where is she?
- Who?

75
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,333
Where is the mother
of my unborn grandchild?

76
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,541
Who? What?
- Whose shoes are those?

77
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,083
These?

78
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,916
These are mine. I bought them at a sale.

79
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:32,916
Oh My God!

80
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,333
Buy one get one free.

81
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,708
Gross! I wish I didn't
live to see this day.

82
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,708
What about the baby?
- It happens.

83
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,416
Science has made a lot of progress.

84
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,541
Just look into each other's eyes.
Especially if you're cockeyed.

85
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,708
Give me water.

86
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,583
Only if it is bottled.

87
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,708
Make yourself comfortable, aunty.
I'll bring it.

88
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,458
What is the matter with you?

89
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,916
What will I tell the world?

90
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,166
That my son is one of them?

91
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,916
Mom. Please stop this.

92
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,708
It's not what you think.

93
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,041
We were rehearsing for a drama..

94
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,166
..And I just might get the lead role.

95
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:14,291
I saw your last drama with
all my kitty party friends.

96
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:19,666
You died before the title when you
told me this role revolves around you.

97
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,708
My death was the central
idea of the story.

98
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,541
They will look for these clues in at least
260 episodes.

99
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,666
Then I might come back to life..

100
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,041
..Or it could be I have a twin brother.

101
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,166
I wish you had a twin brother.

102
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,666
He would help your
father with the business.

103
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,708
He would be our crutch for our old age.

104
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,791
He would not die before
the title like you did.

105
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:39,916
Hello, aunt.

106
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,666
Aunt? Who are you?
- Neighbor.

107
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,708
We had only tap water,
so I thought I'd boil it.

108
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,916
Then I thought I might
as well prepare tea.

109
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,333
Mummy, Shabbo lives in the flat across..

110
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,416
..And supervises the
Production work with Arshad.

111
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,041
This is such a beautiful shirt!
- I brought it for Sheheryar.

112
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,583
If I hadn't brought it he would
go to the henna ceremony in old clothes.

113
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,666
You two can join in.
- A mother's desire.

114
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,958
You want to see your son married, right?

115
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,791
Marriage. Marriage. Marriage.

116
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,666
Why is this community
obsessed with marriage?

117
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,041
In every neighborhood whether
you find a school or not..

118
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,166
Will surely find a wedding hall.

119
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,791
Why are you allergic to weddings?

120
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:16,291
Listen. Your aunt called ten times.

121
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:20,541
Natasha is very excited
about that actress Karishma.

122
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,166
You will bring her to Natasha's
henna ceremony, won't you?

123
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,708
What?
- Yes.

124
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,916
I told you not to brag. Speak less.

125
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,708
She will come if I call.

126
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,666
One can't get a pizza if you call.

127
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:43,708
How can you expect Karishma to come?

128
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,666
Please try. My honor is at stake.

129
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,708
Okay, why don't you..?
- You.

130
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,791
Yes, yes. I am doing it.

131
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,041
Like this. Tanaaz.
- Yes. Like this from the top.

132
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,541
How can it be done now?

133
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,041
Sheheryar?

134
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,708
She will come now and create a racket.
- Thank God, you're here.

135
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,916
Did you find Karishma?
- Yes. Yes. It'll be done.

136
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,666
It will, won't it?
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

137
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,166
Don't worry.
- So excited!

138
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,583
Don't let me down, cousin brother.
- No. Never.

139
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,583
Deceiving the bride is not a good title.

140
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:48,708
Try. Plead with her.
Do something. Please!

141
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,083
Hurry. Hurry.
- I am hurrying.

142
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,541
What do you want me to do?
Get in the phone?

143
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,666
Speak softly. Someone will see.
- Who is going to see?

144
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:00,916
Brother-in-law.

145
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,958
Nervous.
- You look it.

146
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,416
He can't find Karishma Chaudhry.

147
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,083
That's why Natasha will
throw the book at him for that.

148
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,666
Karishma. The film star?

149
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,416
Yes.

150
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,041
For tonight.

151
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,708
What's the big deal? I shall arrange it.

152
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,791
Brother Tashi. Anwar here.

153
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,791
Brother Tashi, tell Karishma Chaurdhry
she must come today..

154
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:28,916
..To my henna ceremony.

155
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,416
Tell her I invited her.

156
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,791
I shall text the address
of the farmhouse.

157
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:32,916
Thank you.

158
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,458
She will come.

159
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,708
Who were you talking to?

160
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,708
My friend is the head of
the finance department at a channel.

161
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:39,541
Oh!

162
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,541
He will do it.

163
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,958
Where did you find this
Nawazzudin Siddique type of groom?

164
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,041
I must say this is a wonderful party!

165
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,833
This is Feroza's doing.
She is a perfectionist.

166
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,583
But the thing that makes
me the happiest today..

167
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,916
..Is that Saniya and you are with me.

168
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,708
After returning I too realize..

169
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,916
..Everything that I have missed.

170
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,541
Our people.

171
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,666
Our surroundings.

172
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,041
Our culture.

173
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,166
Thankfully even Saniya
got permission to come..

174
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,833
..For it was almost impossible for
her to come with the thesis going on.

175
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,708
I'm glad she came too.

176
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:31,916
Where is she?

177
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,708
I haven't had a proper
conversation with her as yet.

178
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,083
She must be around here somewhere.

179
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,041
She must be adjusting to the culture.

180
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:42,166
16 years is a very long time.

181
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,708
Faisal, my friend. How are you?

182
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,791
Take this. Give it to aunty.

183
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,666
Go and give it to her quickly.

184
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,041
Sheheryar!

185
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,041
Faisal, meet my son. The actor.

186
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:14,708
And Sheheryar, this is uncle Faisal.
Your uncle's older brother.

187
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,166
Oh, wow!

188
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,541
What an honor, uncle Faisal.

189
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,333
I am a big fan of your work.

190
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,416
Good to see you, Sheheryar.
- Great to see you, sir.

191
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,791
You wrote such beautiful stories!
The characters were superb!

192
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,708
But I've always wondered..

193
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,666
..Why did you stop writing
at the peak of your career?

194
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,791
I had written many stories.

195
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,916
I forgot to write my own story.

196
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,458
I set out in that quest.

197
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:44,541
Brother Faisal had
a big business in Turkey.

198
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,708
What is your plan
for the future, Faisal?

199
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:53,541
After the death of my wife
I felt my story is coming to an end.

200
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,708
I wish to write some
more stories before it ends.

201
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,541
Wonderful!
Welcome back to the movies, sir.

202
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:05,166
Excuse me.
I'll go and irritate my wife a little.

203
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,041
Sheheryar. Please pass this forward.

204
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,541
You go ahead. I'll follow you.

205
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:39,791
You want some?

206
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,291
Flowers.

207
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,166
Are you selling them?

208
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,166
Who can sell fragrance?

209
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,041
Are you a poet?

210
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:57,958
In the process.

211
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,666
Gradually.

212
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:05,666
Hello, Sheheryar! Buddy. Long time.

213
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,666
You've forgotten about me.

214
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,333
Isn't that right?
- Yeah.

215
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,916
Come over to my showroom.

216
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,833
Hello, pretty lady.

217
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,041
Zaigam at your service.

218
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,666
Handicrafts.

219
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,041
Pure Pakistani.

220
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,666
Made in China.

221
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:32,083
Zaigam, how is your girlfriend?

222
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,041
She is not my girlfriend anymore.

223
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,083
Oh, I see. I see.
Very good!

224
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,166
Incidentally she was of loose character.

225
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,666
She made passes at me.

226
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,541
She even went out with Arshad.

227
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,416
Dumping her was a good move.

228
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,041
I did not dump her.
- Really?

229
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,291
She is my wife now.

230
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:56,666
Wife?

231
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,416
Excuse me.

232
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,791
Sister-in-law.

233
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,416
She was not the girlfriend type.

234
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,708
She was the wife type.

235
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,666
You're strange. You didn't tell me.

236
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,291
You didn't invite me to the wedding.

237
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,041
Do you have kids?

238
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,541
See, I have to go

239
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,666
Wow! Karishma is here.
- Karishma is here.

240
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,541
I'll be right back.

241
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:35,041
O my God! Karishma.

242
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:53,125
"O my love, if you are going to Patyala"

243
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,416
"On your way back,"

244
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,208
"don't forget to bring silk belts."

245
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:02,916
"Make sure half should
be black and half white."

246
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,125
"Sit by my side for a moment..."

247
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:12,708
...and everything you
say is sweet as honey..."

248
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:21,166
"My love, your smile...
...goes up to your eyes."

249
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,625
"I am not going to listen to anyone..."

250
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,041
"...don't take my heart and disappear"

251
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,416
"Sit by my side for a moment."

252
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,666
"Sit by my side for a moment."

253
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,083
"Sit by my side for a moment."

254
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,708
"Sit by my side for a moment."

255
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,583
"Sit by my side for a moment."

256
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,708
"Look at me and smile."

257
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:39,916
"Don't step over my feelings"

258
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:43,541
"I desire for you to open your
heart for me Because I am a rare jewel"

259
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:47,125
"Read my gaze, speak from your heart."

260
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,666
"Sit by my side for a moment."

261
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,083
"Sit by my side for a moment."

262
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,333
"Sit by my side for a moment."

263
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,333
"Sit by my side for a moment."

264
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:21,166
"Except you,
everyone around me desires me."

265
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:25,708
"You are the my heart longs to hear from"

266
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,625
"I desire to be the domain of your heart"

267
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:34,208
"I would go to end of the worlds with you"

268
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:38,833
"I beg for you to agree"

269
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:43,666
"I want you to be the love of my life."

270
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,041
"Sit by my side for a moment."

271
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,666
"Sit by my side for a moment."

272
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,916
"Sit by my side for a moment."

273
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,333
"Sit by my side for a moment."

274
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,708
"Sit by my side for a moment."

275
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,041
"Sit by my side for a moment."

276
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,041
"Sit by my side for a moment."

277
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,333
"Look at me and smile."

278
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,458
"Don't step over my feelings"

279
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:34,083
"I desire for you to open your
heart for me because I am a rare jewel"

280
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,791
"read my gaze, speak from your heart."

281
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,041
"Sit by my side for a moment."

282
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,666
"Sit by my side for a moment."

283
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,875
"Sit by my side for a moment."

284
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,958
"Sit by my side for a moment."

285
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:51,666
"My love, your smile...
...goes up to your eyes."

286
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,041
"I am not going to listen to anyone."

287
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,583
"Don't take my heart and disappear."

288
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,916
"Sit by my side for a moment."

289
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,333
"Sit by my side for a moment."

290
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,708
"Sit by my side for a moment."

291
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,958
"Sit by my side for a moment."

292
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,291
"Sit by my side for a moment."

293
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,708
"Sit by my side for a moment."

294
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,083
"Sit by my side for a moment."

295
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,416
"Sit by my side for a moment."

296
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:20,541
"O my love, if you are going to Patyala"

297
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,583
"On your way back,"

298
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,250
"don't forget to bring silk belts."

299
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:29,625
"Make sure half should

300
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:33,875
"Sit by my side for a moment..."

301
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,208
Thank you, Ms. Karishma. Come.

302
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,250
Let's leave.

303
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,333
What are you doing these days?

304
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:48,708
I am going to Malaysia.

305
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,333
Oh, really! Business or pleasure?

306
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,333
I am going first class.

307
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,125
Shall we?

308
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,875
It is time for your laxative.
- Okay.

309
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,083
Thank you, cousin brother.

310
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,583
Yeah. Thanks, partner.

311
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,250
Anytime, brother-in-law.

312
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,083
Anytime.

313
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,833
You didn't take even one selfie.

314
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,583
Looking nice. My handsome boy!

315
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,208
Hands with curry on them!

316
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,375
Mom.

317
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,833
Who is that?
- Who?

318
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,083
Who else is here?

319
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,250
Saniya? She is Faisal's daughter.

320
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,208
She has come from Turkey.

321
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,458
She's gorgeous!

322
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,458
I'll be right back.

323
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,833
Hi.

324
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,458
Hi.

325
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,000
You dance very well.

326
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,333
Have you learned?
- Yes.

327
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,000
From DVD Khan.

328
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:58,875
Will you have rice pudding?

329
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,250
Don't eat it with a spoon.

330
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:02,625
It's an insult.

331
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,125
With a finger.

332
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,125
Like this.

333
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,333
I'm Sheheryar

334
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:16,958
I know.

335
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,458
I am a distant cousin of yours.

336
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,333
This is an old news

337
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,583
So, what do you think of our country?

338
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,083
First it seemed strange
but now it seems familiar.

339
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,833
Are you flirting with me?

340
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,875
No. Just acting like you.

341
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,000
Tell me. What role
are you playing these days?

342
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,708
Of a hunter or hunted.

343
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,333
Wounded.

344
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,208
Sheheryar.

345
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,125
Huma?

346
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,958
You did not call me after the party.
I was really looking forward to it.

347
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:51,583
Really?

348
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,000
Why?

349
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,083
Why?

350
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,458
Actually my phone was stolen.

351
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,000
You aren't making excuses, are you?

352
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:02,958
No.

353
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,708
You know, stuff happens.

354
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,083
Look, Huma. I'd better run, but..

355
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:11,583
..Call me.

356
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,333
Really?

357
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:18,833
Close friend?

358
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,250
She's a nut job.

359
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,958
She talks to me as if.. I don't know.

360
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,708
We've only met a couple of times.

361
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:26,958
It seemed that way.

362
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,458
Saniya!

363
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:29,583
Lets go ..

364
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,125
Look, I better go.

365
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,000
What's your plan?

366
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,458
A friend is hosting a beach party.

367
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,958
I was planning on going there.
- What a pity.

368
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,458
I am staying here at Natasha's place.

369
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,208
Anyway, bye.

370
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,125
Bye.

371
00:21:56,333 --> 00:22:03,083
"Are you the full moon or the sun?"

372
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,083
Those locks and those looks.

373
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,083
I think God has answered
my prayers today.

374
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,250
Perfect

375
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Just Perfect

376
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:11,833
What?

377
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:14,333
Light.

378
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,458
If Karishma Chaudhry were
seated in this light she would say..

379
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:18,958
Perfecto!

380
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:23,833
So you can see Karishma
Chaudhry in my place right now.

381
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,000
The light is to blame.

382
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,958
We have a naturally lighted frame.

383
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,958
It's bound to remind one of
Karishma Chaudhry, not Chaudhry Shujaat.

384
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:35,458
An unromantic man like
you knows nothing about romance.

385
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,458
Excuse me.

386
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,250
I was called Fawad Khan in college.

387
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:43,333
Really?

388
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,083
I don't know about Fawad Khan..

389
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,458
..But I'm sure they must
have called you Adnan Sami Khan!

390
00:22:59,250 --> 00:22:59,958
Hey.

391
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:03,583
What?

392
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,125
Why are you sad, Tanaaz?

393
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,250
Everybody is getting married.

394
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,125
For me it's an absolutely
hopeless situation.

395
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,958
All the Parsis have gone to Canada.

396
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,583
No eligible bachelor
is left behind for me.

397
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,250
Rustom

398
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,708
I will die a virgin.

399
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,625
Like Madonna.

400
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,625
You silly! Madonna is not a virgin.

401
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,708
Why don't you get married, Rustom?

402
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,333
Will you marry me?

403
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,083
Get lost! You are my friend.

404
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:49,583
It's okay.

405
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,458
Are you planning for new generation?

406
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,958
Shut up!

407
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,583
Friday noon. Casserole. My house.

408
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,083
Mamma makes it so well.

409
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,458
Yes. I'll bring the prawn kebabs.

410
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,500
You will bring kebabs?
- Not too spicy.

411
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,250
How about you, Sheheryar?

412
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:24,208
Coming?

413
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,000
Stop the car.

414
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,083
Please stop the car.

415
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:28,875
What's the matter?
- I'm going back.

416
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,958
I'll drop you.
- No. No.

417
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,708
I shall walk it.

418
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,125
I need some fresh air.

419
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:40,583
Is there stale air in the car?

420
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:42,708
I'll see you guys later.

421
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:46,708
He has lost his mind. Not even
dacoits get out at night over here.

422
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:50,083
You guys have fun. I'll be fine.
- He's completely lost it.

423
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,708
Come on, come on, boys.
Come on. Come on. Get up.

424
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,083
Take your places.
Come on, come on. Run to your area!

425
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,458
Girls, you get up as well.

426
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,250
Come on. Use some strength.

427
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:09,000
Make your own beds.
Don't sleep here. Hurry!

428
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,458
Cousin.

429
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:15,208
How could I let you guys
enjoy all by yourselves?

430
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:16,333
I'm back.

431
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:18,708
Hello.
- Brother-in-law?

432
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:21,708
Welcome back, partner.

433
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:25,625
You keep my secret
while I keep your secret.

434
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:32,458
Hey!

435
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:36,833
Change your mind, huh?

436
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:45,250
Hi.

437
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:46,458
Hey.

438
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,958
What were you doing
here all by yourself?

439
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:04,333
I was counting stars.

440
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,208
"The stars light up one by one."

441
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:14,083
"Your feet walking
towards my destination."

442
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,083
Faiz.

443
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:17,708
I am impressed

444
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:20,333
That reminds me.

445
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,250
"I love your lips. I love your smile."

446
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,875
"But most of all, I love your feet..

447
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,875
..As they walk towards me."

448
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,333
Pablo Neruda.

449
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,583
Now I am impressed.

450
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:39,458
You have brains along with looks.

451
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,583
If I wanted to flirt with you,
I would say I wrote that poem.

452
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:46,250
For whom would you write it?

453
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,375
I haven't had the time
to discover this city.

454
00:26:59,208 --> 00:26:59,875
Let's go.

455
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:02,458
I'll show you the city of lights.

456
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,000
"Although the lights are flickering.."

457
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,583
"But people are still keeping
the flames of their lanterns high."

458
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,625
Let's go.

459
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:36,250
Damn it!

460
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:37,958
You know..

461
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,333
..We've met before?

462
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,583
You remember playing
hide and seek with Natasha?

463
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:44,708
I used to wear frocks
and you wore knickers.

464
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,125
You are Nikki?

465
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,958
The one with piggy tails.
- Yeah.

466
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,250
The swan who turned
into an ugly duckling.

467
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,083
You hide well even back then.

468
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,083
Nobody could find you.

469
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:59,125
All of us would get tired and go away..

470
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:01,250
..But you'd be sitting
in your secret corner.

471
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,250
Even back then?

472
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:04,333
I don't hide now.

473
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:07,208
Have you seen your eyes?

474
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,500
So shifty.

475
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,875
Like you're afraid of being caught.

476
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:24,000
"Amidst the chaos of the surroundings.."

477
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:28,250
"There is a moment frozen in time,"

478
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:32,458
"I am astray. My feet are astray."

479
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,583
"Fragrance emanates from each
and every pore"

480
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:40,958
"Without thinking, without grasping"

481
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:45,000
"I'm resolute in this journey"

482
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:49,250
"My heart still stays with me"

483
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:53,333
"Though I know not when it escaped me"

484
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:57,833
"Without words, the eyes have spoken"

485
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:01,958
"Slowly and slowly these hearts connect."

486
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,208
"O my beloved, don't beguile me."

487
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:14,583
"Without words, the eyes have spoken."

488
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:18,708
"Slowly and slowly these hearts connect."

489
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:26,875
"O my beloved, don't beguile me."

490
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:52,958
"There were calls in my prayers,
But no one within those calls"

491
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,208
"The warmth of your breath touched me"

492
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,333
"And It felt like I had been rewarded"

493
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:05,083
"There's a plea on my lips"

494
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:09,625
"Someone faithful brought
meaning to my prayer"

495
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:14,000
"My heart was a traveller,
aimlessly wandering."

496
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:17,708
"Amazed at where it has led me"

497
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:21,958
"Without words, the eyes have spoken."

498
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:26,208
"Slowly and slowly these hearts connect"

499
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:33,708
"O my beloved, don't beguile me"

500
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:12,375
"Without thinking, without grasping."

501
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:16,625
"I'm resolute in this journey."

502
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,833
"My heart still stays with me"

503
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:25,083
"Though I know not when it escaped me."

504
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:29,208
"Without words, the eyes have spoken."

505
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,208
"Slowly and slowly these hearts connect."

506
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:35,958
Your fathers stories brought to screen
from the pages in this studio.

507
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:41,333
"O my beloved, don't beguile me."

508
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:46,125
"Without words, the eyes have spoken."

509
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:50,333
"Slowly and slowly these hearts connect."

510
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:56,958
"O my beloved, don't beguile me."

511
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,125
I am a big fan of uncle Faisal.

512
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:23,250
I have seen all his films.

513
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:25,208
I am greatly inspired by him.

514
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,833
Even I am a big fan of his.

515
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,333
Poetry, music and old films.

516
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:34,458
My choice is just like my dad's.

517
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,625
"Without words, the eyes have spoken."

518
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:42,958
"Slowly and slowly these hearts connect."

519
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:49,708
"O my beloved, don't beguile me."

520
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:55,500
"Without words, the eyes have spoken."

521
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:59,708
"Slowly and slowly these hearts connect."

522
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:07,208
"O my beloved, don't beguile me."

523
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,375
What did you wish?

524
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:42,875
Pakistan.

525
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:44,500
And you?

526
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,583
I am Pakistan.

527
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:15,625
Let's take a picture.

528
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:28,583
O my God! No signals.

529
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:32,208
Can we go back?
Everyone must be worried.

530
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:37,500
These were the only few moments
which were free from time's jail.

531
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:40,250
She has never done this before.

532
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:44,333
And why would she leave
without informing me?

533
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,250
I can't make sense.

534
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,875
This area is dangerous.
You should remain cautious.

535
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:51,875
Anyway, we are looking for her.

536
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:54,375
By God's will, we will surely find her.

537
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:00,000
Lets Go

538
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,208
As for the boy..

539
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,000
..Can he be trusted?

540
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,083
I think it was left turn?

541
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:19,583
Right?

542
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:20,958
Yes.

543
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,250
I think it was right.

544
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:23,958
Yes, you are right.

545
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:27,958
Damn

546
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:35,708
We still don't have signals.

547
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,625
Shouldn't we ask them for directions?

548
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:46,833
Get away from the kidnapper, ma'am!

549
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:49,250
Kidnapper, hands up!
- Kidnapper?

550
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:51,333
You have nowhere to run.

551
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:53,958
He can't go anywhere in any case.

552
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,833
It was wrong.

553
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,250
You could have informed
me at the very least.

554
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:00,333
All of us were so worried.

555
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,250
Go and send Sheheryar.

556
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:18,625
Your turn.

557
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:20,958
Death penalty or life imprisonment?

558
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,583
He will render the verdict.

559
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:25,208
Life imprisonment is
a good option. Take it.

560
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,083
Did you enjoy the reprimand?

561
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:38,833
That was no reprimand.

562
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,458
Father does not get angry.

563
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:42,583
He says both, time and blood are wasted.

564
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:45,250
And my mom thought we'd eloped.

565
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,250
Eloped?

566
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,250
But why?

567
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,208
Because their mind only
revolves around marriage.

568
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,458
How did marriage get into this?

569
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:57,458
Very true.

570
00:36:58,208 --> 00:36:59,083
You tell me.

571
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:03,958
Do you know any person with
whom you can spend your whole life?

572
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,958
Without getting bore?

573
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,958
You tell me.

574
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:09,875
I'll have to think about it.

575
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,875
I need to explore. Discover.

576
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,000
You make women sound like a continent.

577
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,500
Discover. Explore. Exploit. Colonize.

578
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,458
I'm joking.

579
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:23,833
The fact is why would anybody marry me?

580
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:25,833
I have no standing.

581
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,708
I'm a struggling actor.

582
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:28,875
But wait and watch.

583
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:32,125
Someday Producers and Directors
will queue up in front of my house.

584
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,458
All I need is just..

585
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:34,875
..One good role.

586
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,458
I am confident.

587
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:40,208
Really?

588
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,250
Think about it.

589
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,000
None of the others are.

590
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,333
May I have the last sip?

591
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,500
I am returning day after tomorrow.

592
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:09,833
What?

593
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:13,458
The reason I came here is done.

594
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,250
What's that?

595
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:18,708
Just like parents forcibly
send their children to school..

596
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:21,000
..I came to escort my dad to Pakistan.

597
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,583
He's been idling for years..

598
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:24,708
..In Turkey having
set aside his passion.

599
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:26,833
First for mom's happiness..

600
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:30,458
..And after her death, for me.

601
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:34,000
He never said one word.

602
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:36,500
But I know he is unhappy.

603
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:40,125
That's why I want him to
stay here and start writing again.

604
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:42,958
So, why are you returning?

605
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:45,333
I studied hard so many years.

606
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:47,375
Why would I quit in the final years?

607
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,250
Who will look after him?

608
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,333
Uncle is here..

609
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,958
..And I will come occasionally.

610
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,250
You'll be missed.

611
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:58,208
Really?

612
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,708
Mr. Explorer. Mr. Discover.

613
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,958
Can we stay in touch?

614
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:04,708
Give me your number.

615
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:06,333
It's pointless.

616
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:09,375
You won't call and
I will wait without reason.

617
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,583
Try me.

618
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,208
Think about it.

619
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,458
"She has taken after you."

620
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:28,083
"Sure, but her eyes are like yours."

621
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:30,583
Dad.

622
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:33,208
What is this?

623
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,125
Memories, my dear.

624
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:43,000
I was asking the memories
if I should thank them and smile or..

625
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,583
..Or hold a grudge and get upset.

626
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:50,083
Isn't it possible to do both together?

627
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,375
I had a grudge against your mother..

628
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,708
..For leaving me.

629
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,083
And now..

630
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:03,000
Now I am compelling you to go from here.

631
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:06,458
Mom's departure was not her decision..

632
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:09,083
..But this is our mutual plan, isn't it?

633
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:11,875
I will come to see you often.

634
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:15,333
Maybe that way I too will
form a bond with your land.

635
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:23,708
This mean I will get have
your love in intervals now.

636
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:28,250
Just keep writing these words to me.

637
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:31,958
Then I won't miss you as much.

638
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:35,333
Come back quickly, my dear.

639
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:40,250
I don't have much time left.

640
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:46,250
I just want to see you get married soon.

641
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:52,333
After that you will have to see my kids,
kid's kids and their kids.

642
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:55,958
Saniya, my dear.

643
00:40:57,458 --> 00:40:58,833
He's a good boy.

644
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:09,250
Take care.

645
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:19,875
Sheheryar

646
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:23,000
are you coming with us to drop Saniya?

647
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:24,250
No, uncle.

648
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,625
I came to see you.

649
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:27,958
Didn't you tell me to
come spend time with you?

650
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,458
So, I thought I'd waste your time today.

651
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:31,375
Wow!

652
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:34,250
My dear, you go and pack your things.

653
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:37,250
I shall talk to my friend.

654
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:39,500
Okay, father.
- Come on in.

655
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I hope I am not
interrupting in your work.

656
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:50,041
Of course not.

657
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:55,166
Maybe this interruption
will steer my story elsewhere.

658
00:41:56,875 --> 00:41:58,916
In any case, the story writes itself.

659
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:02,291
We are puppets to it.

660
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,416
"Blank paper, stares at me"

661
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:10,250
"A pen wanders."

662
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:14,041
"Endless amount of prose and poetry..

663
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,041
..Flows out of my heart."

664
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,375
Did you understand?

665
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:20,041
I have..

666
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:21,916
..Returned after many years..

667
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,666
..Looking for some
new and some old ties.

668
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:31,041
You are a drama actor.

669
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:32,500
Yes, uncle.

670
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:34,416
Alone.

671
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:36,041
Looking for a role.

672
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,541
Man can find himself in solitude.

673
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:44,666
For nobody reveals himself in a crowd.

674
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:50,041
I have heard you guys read books..

675
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:52,416
..When the drama made
on it becomes a hit.

676
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:58,625
I am thinking of making
a drama out of this.

677
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:00,625
What do you think?

678
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:02,916
Superb idea, uncle.

679
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,666
Even your film scripts are memorable.

680
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,041
Will you make a drama from my script?

681
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:09,291
Me?

682
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:12,291
Of course.

683
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:14,375
I mean I would love to, uncle.

684
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,541
If only I'm lucky
enough to get the chance.

685
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,041
One does not get a chance, son.

686
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:21,541
One has to snatch the chance.

687
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,250
Do it and show me.

688
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,666
Meeting with Faisal Uncle was amazing.

689
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:33,333
Who's father is he by the way

690
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:35,833
Obviously

691
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:37,875
But I am serious

692
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:41,583
I will suggest you to
think before getting serious

693
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:45,416
I just want you to meet
the Director once more.

694
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,666
Just wait for five minutes.
- Sure sure, why not?

695
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:49,666
Not from here.

696
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:52,625
The casting of extras
is going on over here.

697
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,875
Sheheryar.

698
00:43:58,291 --> 00:43:59,125
Mom.

699
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,041
Is everything okay?
- Yes, all is well.

700
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,625
Actually I came here for an audition.
Can you believe it?

701
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:06,000
Audition?

702
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:07,916
Hello

703
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,666
Ring ring, heroin ran away?

704
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:14,250
The producer has offered
me a role in the next drama.

705
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:16,291
"Wretched mother-in-law and
characterless daughter-in-law."

706
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,916
Can you believe it?
I just could not refuse.

707
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,041
But what are you doing over here?

708
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:24,916
I came for a small audition.

709
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:26,791
Nothing major.

710
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:29,166
Why don't you two come
to the dressing room?

711
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,000
You can speak there at leisure.

712
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:31,916
Yes.
- Please come.

713
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:32,666
Okay.

714
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,291
What is this, mom?

715
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,541
Why?

716
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:09,250
Is it too bright?

717
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:11,625
You are embarrassing me.

718
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:13,250
Does half dad know?

719
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:14,291
Yes.

720
00:45:16,916 --> 00:45:19,541
Why are you leaving your comfortable
life to get into this struggle?

721
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:21,250
I was getting bored at home.

722
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:23,541
Your friend suggested to act in dramas.

723
00:45:23,916 --> 00:45:24,916
Your time will pass.
- Oh, for God's..

724
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:27,166
So, I came.
- Acting is a profession.

725
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,250
Not a time pass.
- I know.

726
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:32,166
But I have nothing
else to do in my life.

727
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,250
So, relax.

728
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,250
You have had your share of adventures.

729
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,291
Now just..

730
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:39,250
Just chill.
- Well, that's exactly what I am doing.

731
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:40,416
Just chilling.

732
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,250
Quite possibly..

733
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:47,666
..This way I could help you in some way.

734
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,166
Else this industry?

735
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:53,000
This is all I wanted.

736
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:58,375
Sheheryar, every person needs support..

737
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:01,250
..To get someplace in life.

738
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,291
Sometimes from loved ones,
sometimes from friends..

739
00:46:03,416 --> 00:46:04,666
..And sometimes even from strangers.

740
00:46:04,791 --> 00:46:06,125
That's just the problem, mom.

741
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,875
The one whose support was needed..

742
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,541
..That father left you silently.

743
00:46:10,916 --> 00:46:12,875
You got half dad's support, didn't you..

744
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,375
..But my life was screwed up.

745
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:18,500
Sheheryar, why are you saying that?

746
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:20,291
What else am I supposed to say, mom?

747
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:25,250
I tried to run away from real life
to breathe in this make believe life.

748
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:27,166
Today you followed me here as well.

749
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,625
As a heroine.

750
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:31,416
While I am an extra.

751
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:35,916
You shouldn't say such things.
Why are you saying such things?

752
00:46:36,416 --> 00:46:38,041
Listen to me.

753
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:42,916
You need to get married.
- Oh, wow!

754
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:46,416
Then you will see a
difference in your life.

755
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:51,250
You like brother Faisal's
daughter Saniya very much?

756
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,250
Thank you very much, mom.
Thank you very much.

757
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,625
Are you serious?

758
00:46:55,666 --> 00:46:58,041
You still feel marriage
is the solution for problems?

759
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:00,916
Even if it is not a solution,
surely it is a diversion.

760
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:04,625
Please come, Ms.
Farida. The Director's here.

761
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:06,166
Okay, I'm coming.

762
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:19,416
See You!

763
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:26,916
I love you.

764
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:28,875
Why? How?

765
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:30,500
I don't know.

766
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:32,250
But I love you.

767
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:35,375
What can one say about love?
Love is blind.

768
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:37,041
By sight as well as by brains.

769
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,041
What is the problem?

770
00:48:40,791 --> 00:48:41,916
My problem is that..

771
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,416
..You don't have a problem.

772
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:44,541
Hello.

773
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:46,791
Hi.

774
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:55,666
Is everything okay?

775
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:57,250
Yes, everything is okay.

776
00:48:57,375 --> 00:49:00,000
Why don't you go and bring
my whole family into dramas?

777
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,541
I would do it if I had the budget.

778
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:04,875
Anyway, there is no
reason to be so upset.

779
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,250
He called again.
It is a good role. Do it.

780
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:10,416
I told you I refuse to be a corpse.

781
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:13,500
All you have to do is
lie down with a sheet on you.

782
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:16,916
The best actresses will come
and bang their heads on your chest.

783
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,125
The job will last ten episodes.

784
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,166
Wow! It's a long role.

785
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,041
For a corpse.
- Yes.

786
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:24,541
Imagine that.
They are paying five thousand rupees.

787
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:27,416
They are paying to lie down?

788
00:49:27,541 --> 00:49:30,541
I would lie down anywhere
for that kind of money.

789
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:35,125
No! No! No! No! No! I did not mean that.

790
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:37,125
I was..
- My head is spinning as it is.

791
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:38,666
Guys, please leave me alone.

792
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:41,208
What is the matter, Sheheryar?
Why are you so upset?

793
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:42,166
Mom.

794
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:46,541
Once again she is
obsessed with my marriage.

795
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:49,250
And who is the bride this time?

796
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:51,375
Saniya.

797
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:52,541
Really?

798
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,291
So, what is the problem?

799
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,291
That is very good news, isn't it?

800
00:49:56,416 --> 00:49:59,375
Even you like her, don't you?
- Have you lost your mind?

801
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:01,291
Are you intoxicated?

802
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:02,791
I don't want to get married.

803
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,291
Exactly! He doesn't want to get married!

804
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,375
As it is my situation
isn't coming in control..

805
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:09,375
..And mom is driving
me emotionally crazy.

806
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:10,541
Excuse me!

807
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,541
There is no problem for
you men in this industry.

808
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:15,375
Marriage is a problem for women.

809
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:17,625
Now I have buy new clothes again

810
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:19,291
Saniya is a nice girl but..

811
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,041
..It does not mean she
wants to get married to me.

812
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,291
And what is she does want to marry you?

813
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,541
Look. It is her message.

814
00:50:29,916 --> 00:50:31,541
I'm telling you this is a sign.

815
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:33,541
Shut up!

816
00:50:35,041 --> 00:50:38,000
Whatever! I'm not prepared
for long term commitment right now.

817
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:40,291
But you can be friends, Sheheryar.

818
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:42,416
Try to understand the scene.

819
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:44,916
You pan the camera to the right,
his mother is ready.

820
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,666
You pan the camera to the left,
the girl is ready.

821
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:49,916
And if the trailer of this
film leaks before it is released..

822
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:52,000
..His commitment phobia will..

823
00:50:53,041 --> 00:50:54,291
..Come out through his nose.

824
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:57,416
Take my advice.

825
00:50:57,875 --> 00:50:59,666
Cut Saniya's scene in this film.

826
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:03,166
Look at where the hell it is!

827
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,208
If its Saniya then say Yes

828
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:05,541
Disconnect it. Disconnect it.

829
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:06,916
Swipe Right
I am going down.

830
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:10,250
He went out.

831
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:12,291
What am I supposed to do if he went out?

832
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:47,250
"The number you are dialing
is not answering, please try later"

833
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:59,041
Arshad, is that a sign too?

834
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,166
Damn!

835
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:46,000
This boy is still asleep.

836
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:48,541
He spread things all over

837
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:49,916
Brother!

838
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:51,500
Wake up.

839
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:55,250
Wake up, Mohan Pyare. Hashtag, get up!

840
00:52:55,416 --> 00:52:57,666
Yes Arshad is driving

841
00:52:57,791 --> 00:53:00,125
Sheheryar? Of course Sheheryar is with us.

842
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:02,166
You check up too much.
Well, anyway.. Okay, bye.

843
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,666
It is Sunday, man! Let me sleep.

844
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:06,625
As though you go jogging on Mondays.

845
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:08,541
Wake up. I have to get dressed up too.

846
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:10,541
Hurry up, Sheheryar.

847
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:12,791
Nowruz is being celebrated
at Tanaaz's house today.

848
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:18,166
There are only 20,30 Parsis left
in this world and still irritating us.

849
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,916
Excuse me.
They have called 6 times since morning.

850
00:53:21,041 --> 00:53:22,250
I'm tired now.

851
00:53:22,291 --> 00:53:24,416
Brother, you get one opportunity
in the year to bathe.

852
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:26,916
Don't waste it.
Come on. Good boy! Good boy!

853
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,041
Calm down, relax, I am going

854
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,041
I am going.

855
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:31,541
Don't knock.

856
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:38,500
Done
- Get Lost ...

857
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,500
I am very happy.

858
00:53:50,666 --> 00:53:55,041
A new guest has come today
to celebrate our traditional...

859
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:56,916
...Nowruz with us.

860
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:59,916
We are celebrating this
for the last three thousand years

861
00:54:00,041 --> 00:54:01,666
We mean Zoroastrians

862
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:03,291
I am not that old.

863
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:05,000
Huh This joke is also
three thousand years old

864
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:07,166
Anyway, all of you
come here and take a look.

865
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:09,166
Seven items are placed here.

866
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:10,666
All of them begin with the letter S.

867
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:13,250
This is 'Shama.' That means candle.

868
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:17,166
And this is 'Sherbet.'
Earlier it used to be 'Sharaab.'

869
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,541
Now it is 'sherbet.' - Beverage

870
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:22,791
I don't want needless
problems with the Moral Police.

871
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:26,166
And this is S for
'Shirin.' It is a dessert.

872
00:54:26,291 --> 00:54:29,291
And this 'Sheer'. That means milk.

873
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:31,541
And we have S for 'Shehed.' Honey.

874
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:35,500
And this is 'Shakkar.'
Just like my honey bunny.

875
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:39,250
It starts with an S even in English.

876
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:40,916
Aah! Sugar.

877
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,541
And 'Sikka' meaning coins.

878
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:47,416
And finally,
this is 'Sheesha.' Meaning mirror.

879
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:52,166
'Don't ever forget me."

880
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,416
Everybody start eating now. Have fun!

881
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,916
Aunty, even Tanaaz begins with an S.

882
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,916
- How come?
- Shweet Heart!

883
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Bloody shameless! Flirt!

884
00:55:02,041 --> 00:55:03,916
Tanaaz, by this eternal flame..

885
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:07,166
..I swear I want you
to be my lawfully bedded..

886
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:08,541
Wedded wife.

887
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:10,916
Will you marry me?

888
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:17,166
I propose a toast to the new couple.

889
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,041
Everyday Nowruz

890
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:24,250
Every day should be like Nowruz

891
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:29,291
"Congratulations,
Congratulations, Congratulations"

892
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:34,541
"Congratulations,
Congratulations, Congratulations"

893
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:38,416
"Congratulations,
Congratulations, Congratulations"

894
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:43,916
Look, Sherry. Rustom gave me
a distant relative of the Kohinoor.

895
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,541
Congratulations

896
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,666
Oh!

897
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:49,291
Where is the cake?

898
00:55:50,416 --> 00:55:51,541
I'll bring it.

899
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,375
Hey! Not now! Not now! Go!

900
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,291
Wow!

901
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:05,916
They sent a tiger to protect the lamb.

902
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:14,125
My God! We've lost power.
How did this happen?

903
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:16,916
Rustom!
- Sorry, aunty Della!

904
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,416
Where is Tanaaz?

905
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,541
It was a mistake.

906
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:22,625
Where Tanaaz has gone?
She never stop at one place.

907
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:27,000
O my God! How did this happen?

908
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:29,375
What happened?

909
00:56:31,041 --> 00:56:33,500
Oh, boy! Seven years of bad luck!

910
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,041
O my God! What is this?

911
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:38,791
Sorry, aunt Della.
I didn't even touch it. I don't know..

912
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:40,541
No, no. This table is very wobbly.

913
00:56:40,666 --> 00:56:43,416
Zarine, can you go
get another mirror? Please.

914
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:45,875
Let's all move to the sitting room.

915
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:48,875
We have seven years of bad luck.

916
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:50,416
The mirror broke.

917
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:53,750
Lord knows what will happen.

918
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,250
Saniya?

919
00:57:03,541 --> 00:57:04,375
Wow!

920
00:57:05,041 --> 00:57:05,541
Hi.

921
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,416
Hi, Sheheryar.

922
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:10,541
What a pleasant surprise!

923
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:13,666
One could learn how
to enchant people from you.

924
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:16,916
Look.

925
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:18,625
Don't disappear

926
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:21,166
I'll be right back.

927
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:36,250
What?

928
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:39,875
She's back. Saniya. She has returned.

929
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,541
Hey!

930
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:44,375
Listen to him.

931
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:47,875
Where have you reached?

932
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:54,916
How are you?

933
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,500
Sorry.

934
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:06,375
My phone was stolen.

935
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:07,791
Oh!

936
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:11,000
Didn't you think of a
better excuse in all this time?

937
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:14,041
This is very lame.

938
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,916
The truth is always lame.

939
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:17,375
How do I sweeten it?

940
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:21,250
Incidentally, the thief's
timing are better than you.

941
00:58:24,291 --> 00:58:26,041
Sania, I really tried to contact you.

942
00:58:26,916 --> 00:58:28,791
You blocked me everywhere.

943
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:30,416
Be it friendship or animosity..

944
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:33,166
..I know how to discharge
my relationships.

945
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:38,250
I have to learn how
to discharge from you.

946
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:41,625
Hi Saniya How are you?

947
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:43,500
Saniya! Hi.

948
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:45,625
Hello.
- Hello, guys.

949
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:48,916
Sheheryar. Shabbo.

950
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:50,375
Meet Hassan.

951
00:58:52,041 --> 00:58:53,125
My fianc*.

952
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:55,041
What?
- You..

953
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:59,375
You.. You have great choice, Saniya!

954
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:00,583
Wow!

955
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:03,166
Hello. Greetings.

956
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,500
I am pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.

957
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:08,541
Hi.
- Hi.

958
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:11,791
I'll go and tell everyone.

959
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,291
Sheheryar

960
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:16,416
Hassan is an investment Banker.

961
00:59:17,416 --> 00:59:20,250
He invests in the right
place at the right time.

962
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,041
How nice!

963
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:26,291
And Hasan,
not only is Sheheryar a good actor,

964
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:28,250
he is a very good guide too.

965
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:31,125
He knows every corner of this city.

966
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:32,041
Really?

967
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,375
Then I will need you very much, Sheheryar.

968
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:36,916
Sheheryar

969
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,291
you will show Hassan the city,
won't you?

970
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:41,875
He has returned after twenty years.

971
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:43,500
Why Not!

972
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:46,916
This city has changed lot

973
00:59:48,916 --> 00:59:53,041
Welcome. Welcome.
Welcome, my child! Welcome.

974
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,791
How is my girl?

975
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,250
Come. I'll put a vermilion
spot on your forehead. Let's go.

976
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:58,375
Lets go

977
01:00:16,291 --> 01:00:17,375
Hi, Sheheryar.

978
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,666
Where did you disappear yesterday?

979
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,166
There's a difference between
disappearing and not being visible.

980
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:27,166
In any case,
I couldn't talk to you yesterday..

981
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:29,541
..So I thought today..
- Hi, Sheheryar.

982
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,916
How you doing, bro?
- Hey.

983
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:35,250
Natasha is taking us out to lunch.
Why don't you join us?

984
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:37,041
Oh!

985
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:39,041
No, thanks.

986
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:43,291
I will sit with uncle Faisal today but..

987
01:00:43,916 --> 01:00:45,000
..You two carry on.

988
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:51,916
I owe you a tour of Karachi.

989
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,041
Done.

990
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:22,000
Thank you

991
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:25,291
I am fulfilling one more promise today.

992
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:28,250
Take this. For you.

993
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:31,916
I can't believe this.

994
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:34,166
It's all done?

995
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:39,291
This script was dying
for long time to get alive

996
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:45,250
Saniya's mother was sad that
she bound the artist within me..

997
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:48,916
Artist who was arrested
by financial chains

998
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:53,625
She did not know that
an artist does not die..

999
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:57,166
..But rather it lives
on with a whimper..

1000
01:01:57,625 --> 01:02:02,416
..Hoping that he might
unexpectedly get relief someday.

1001
01:02:07,666 --> 01:02:08,916
Thank you, uncle Faisal.

1002
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:16,166
Go and read it.

1003
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:22,375
Your future is hidden
in these paragraphs.

1004
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,250
Thank you!

1005
01:02:37,541 --> 01:02:38,291
What's the matter?

1006
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:41,291
The Doctor has given up on your mother.

1007
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:42,500
She is in a coma.

1008
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:48,375
Stop worrying. All will be okay.

1009
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:50,375
Your mother is exceptional.

1010
01:02:51,166 --> 01:02:52,500
It does not look like she is acting.

1011
01:02:52,541 --> 01:02:54,291
Even the coma seems like a full stop.

1012
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:57,000
Entirely lifeless. It is natural.

1013
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:59,250
Tell me. What are you doing here?

1014
01:03:00,416 --> 01:03:03,416
Mom woke up from her coma and
messaged me to take you to the tailor.

1015
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:05,666
Your suit has to be
sewn for Rustam's wedding.

1016
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,166
She is so concerned.

1017
01:03:08,291 --> 01:03:14,041
But I have decided I will
only wear my wedding suit.

1018
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:16,041
It has been hanging up for years.

1019
01:03:16,916 --> 01:03:19,000
What can the tailor
do if you are decided?

1020
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:21,291
Come. I'll show you around the showroom.

1021
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:23,250
A lot of new things have come in.

1022
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:37,125
The ratings of Wretched mother-in-law..

1023
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:38,291
..And characterless
daughter-in-law are amazing.

1024
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:40,250
Your mother is a great hit!

1025
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:43,666
Producers queue up from morning.

1026
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,416
One role after another.
One role after another.

1027
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:49,166
Mom has luck along with talent.

1028
01:03:49,416 --> 01:03:53,250
She worries a lot for you.
It's still not too late, son.

1029
01:03:53,416 --> 01:03:55,625
Come back and give me a hand.

1030
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,500
I am failing. I'm not a failure.

1031
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,791
"The armlet keeps getting loose."

1032
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:19,250
"The armlet keeps getting loose."

1033
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,916
How do I look?

1034
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:27,041
If you sit on a Jaguar's bonnet,
headlights won't be required.

1035
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:30,666
Don't taunt me. Tell the truth.

1036
01:04:32,541 --> 01:04:34,416
Everyone will burn to
crisp of jealousy, right?

1037
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:36,416
There will be no flame or embers.

1038
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:39,416
There's still life
left in this old beauty.

1039
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:41,916
Why waste money unnecessarily?

1040
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:49,291
Not bad. Not bad at all!

1041
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:52,500
What?

1042
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,791
This is the first time
I am feeling minority?

1043
01:05:23,875 --> 01:05:26,166
Come. Let's go inside
to watch the wedding ceremony.

1044
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:28,625
Everyone is all praise for this wedding.

1045
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:35,500
Hello, sir.
- Hello. Greetings. Who are you?

1046
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:37,666
Where have you come from?
You are an infiltrator.

1047
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:39,166
A trespasser.

1048
01:05:39,291 --> 01:05:41,250
Why have you come here?
Food, Oh I mean for wedding..

1049
01:05:41,541 --> 01:05:43,291
We are here for the wedding.
- Wedding?

1050
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:45,041
We have the wedding card.

1051
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:46,166
Whose wedding?

1052
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:49,041
Whose destruction?
- Rustom's.

1053
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:50,541
Rustom's.

1054
01:05:51,125 --> 01:05:52,291
Rustom died.

1055
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,208
Rustom is finished. He died.

1056
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:58,208
He was very young. He died.
- No, sir. Not that Rustom.

1057
01:05:58,291 --> 01:05:59,166
Our friend Rustom.

1058
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:01,875
You weren't even born when he died.

1059
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,625
Don't you know he passed away?

1060
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:07,041
He went to sleep. He slept forever.

1061
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:09,250
He has gone to meet his maker.

1062
01:06:09,291 --> 01:06:11,500
He has suffered from his Mortal Coil.

1063
01:06:12,166 --> 01:06:15,916
He is ex-Rustom.
He is no more. He's gone.

1064
01:06:16,041 --> 01:06:20,000
He got out of the photo, entered
a frame and got stuck to the wall.

1065
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:22,166
He croaked. Croaked.

1066
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,541
He croaked.

1067
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:26,166
Sorry. You can go.

1068
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:29,166
Dad, it's time for your pills. Shall we?
- Pill.

1069
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:30,916
Come here. Come here.

1070
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:34,291
Do you know what is behind the pill?

1071
01:06:35,416 --> 01:06:36,500
Bye-bye.

1072
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:39,541
Ok I am going now enjoy enjoy

1073
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:40,666
"My heart is unrestrained and free."

1074
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:44,291
"Why should someone claim it."

1075
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:48,375
"Wild and free, it does as it pleases."

1076
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:52,291
"I have kept it protected
from being tied down."

1077
01:07:53,583 --> 01:07:58,375
"Innocent and na*ve, this heart
what it desires is challenging"

1078
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:06,666
"However, this moment is special
my heart beat is locked down"

1079
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:13,041
"This poor heart."

1080
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:16,916
"Has fallen for you my beloved
its chasing you around in circles."

1081
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,166
"It has awoken again"

1082
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:25,625
"It believes this spectacle of the stars
is a sign from God."

1083
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:49,458
"Why does it always end up falling,
For forbidden love."

1084
01:08:49,541 --> 01:08:56,916
"It always gets hurt taking paths,
not meant to be followed"

1085
01:08:56,958 --> 01:09:01,166
"Don't get tied down yet again
O bruised and battered heart of mine"

1086
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:04,916
"This poor heart"

1087
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,500
"Has fallen for you my beloved
its chasing you around in circles."

1088
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:13,166
"It has awoken again."

1089
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:17,916
"It believes this spectacle of the stars
is a sign from God."

1090
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:41,500
"Don't listen to the silly musings of your
heart it only means to delude, my love."

1091
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:45,333
"At first, Recklessly falling in love
only to regret later."

1092
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:52,916
"Let it run free and wild
fumbling and tumbling as it wishes."

1093
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,875
"This poor heart."

1094
01:09:56,916 --> 01:10:01,375
"Has fallen for you my beloved
its chasing you around in circles."

1095
01:10:01,416 --> 01:10:05,041
"It has awoken again."

1096
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:08,875
"It believes this spectacle of the stars
is a sign from God."

1097
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:12,791
"This poor heart."

1098
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:17,375
"Has fallen for you my beloved
its chasing you around in circles."

1099
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:21,166
"It has awoken again."

1100
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:25,791
"It believes this spectacle of the stars
is a sign from God."

1101
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:50,000
What has Hasan eaten now?

1102
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:53,166
I don't know.
Anything the poor chap eats..

1103
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,125
He does not eat it thinking
of his own stomach.

1104
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,250
Seems like a nice guy.

1105
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:03,791
He is.

1106
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:12,666
My phone was really stolen that day.

1107
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:16,625
That's what the problem is.

1108
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,541
You give all your
performances outside the TV.

1109
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,166
I bear no grudge, Sheheryar.

1110
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:23,250
Lies.

1111
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:29,541
How does my drop of a lie
matter in your river of lies?

1112
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:31,666
Why are you so angry with me, Saniya..

1113
01:11:32,041 --> 01:11:33,916
..That you blocked me everywhere?

1114
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:40,625
How is your work?

1115
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:42,250
Work? What work?

1116
01:11:42,916 --> 01:11:44,791
Father wrote something for you,
didn't he?

1117
01:11:44,916 --> 01:11:46,041
Yes.

1118
01:11:47,416 --> 01:11:50,250
It's a fantastic script, Saniya!
I'm totally in love with it.

1119
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:53,416
I am looking for a financier.

1120
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,041
Really?

1121
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:57,041
So, you know what love is?

1122
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,791
You tell me.

1123
01:12:02,291 --> 01:12:05,250
Are you in love with Mr. Nice guy?

1124
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:08,125
Why not? He's smart, he is intelligent..

1125
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:11,000
..And most importantly
he is a sensitive person.

1126
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:14,166
Someone who cares about others
feelings apart from his own.

1127
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:24,416
Saniya.

1128
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:32,916
Can't we give this
relationship another chance?

1129
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:34,791
What do you mean?

1130
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:37,250
Give us a little time. Come on!

1131
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,416
One more chance?

1132
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:45,666
And why, Sheheryar?

1133
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:47,541
Why would I do that?

1134
01:12:47,666 --> 01:12:50,500
Coz there is something.
There is something between us as well.

1135
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:54,416
We should get one more
chance to understand each other.

1136
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:56,916
Maybe we'll find a way.
Hasan isn't running away, is he?

1137
01:12:57,041 --> 01:12:59,291
And I am not going to
run away from him either.

1138
01:13:02,458 --> 01:13:05,416
And what about the..

1139
01:13:05,541 --> 01:13:08,250
..Unexpressed relationship between us?

1140
01:13:08,291 --> 01:13:10,541
What am I to do with this
unexpressed relationship, Sheheryar?

1141
01:13:10,666 --> 01:13:12,541
But what more can I say?

1142
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:15,666
I don't have a career.
I don't have a future.

1143
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,625
How can I make a commitment?
- Shut up, Sheheryar!

1144
01:13:19,041 --> 01:13:20,250
Just excuses.

1145
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:26,041
And you, Saniya.

1146
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,375
Why do you have this Cinderella complex?

1147
01:13:28,791 --> 01:13:30,291
Why are you in such a hurry?

1148
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:33,416
Mistakes happen. Luck plays games.

1149
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:37,166
Can't you give this
relationship one more chance?

1150
01:13:37,541 --> 01:13:38,291
No!

1151
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:44,041
I cannot do any such thing
because I am in a hurry. Yes!

1152
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:48,500
Please. Please do me a big favor!

1153
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:50,875
Leave me alone!

1154
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,500
You're hurting me, Sheheryar.

1155
01:13:57,791 --> 01:14:00,916
And you're hurting me, Saniya.

1156
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:28,875
'And I am not going to
run away from him either.'

1157
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:33,291
'Can't we give this
relationship another chance?'

1158
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:35,916
'No! Just leave me alone!'

1159
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:44,541
'You're hurting me'

1160
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:39,000
Oh! He's gone!
What's the point of living without him?

1161
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:41,375
He's gone!

1162
01:15:41,916 --> 01:15:44,375
He went before his parents.

1163
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,541
What's the point of living without him?

1164
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,125
Cut! Excellent, Ms. Farida! Excellent!
- Get up! Get up!

1165
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:55,416
Get up! - For the next shot,
why don't we resume after the lunch?

1166
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,500
Get up!
- Come, Ms. Farida.

1167
01:15:56,541 --> 01:15:58,666
Your lunch is ready in the vanity van.

1168
01:15:58,916 --> 01:16:02,125
We shall discuss your
next script over there.

1169
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:14,625
Will somebody offer water
to the corpse as well?!

1170
01:16:17,416 --> 01:16:21,666
"One does not get a chance, son.
One has to snatch the chance."

1171
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,375
Such great writing, man!
It is heart touching.

1172
01:16:35,541 --> 01:16:36,500
Heart touching.

1173
01:16:38,125 --> 01:16:39,125
It's done, son.

1174
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:40,666
Your job is done.

1175
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:50,500
Incidentally, I shall take
credit for the writing, okay.

1176
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:53,666
Sir.

1177
01:16:54,041 --> 01:16:55,000
Sir.

1178
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:56,625
Sir!

1179
01:16:56,666 --> 01:16:58,541
Sir, it appears the hero's character..

1180
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:01,666
..Has been written with you in mind.

1181
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:06,000
Wonderful! Wonderful!

1182
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:16,625
So, he's a writer.
He is not my father.

1183
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,375
Throw him out.

1184
01:17:19,125 --> 01:17:20,500
Bloody fool!

1185
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:24,750
Yes.
- Sir, the script.

1186
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:27,541
Oh!

1187
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:31,250
The one that you want
to Produce yourself, right?

1188
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:34,291
My men have read it.

1189
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:36,000
It's good.

1190
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:37,666
Who wrote it?

1191
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,500
Sir, a very good old writer, Mr.
Faisal Abbas has..

1192
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:45,041
Don't talk to me about these historical.

1193
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:47,666
The writing that's
been done these days..

1194
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,375
..Is the only thing
that people can digest.

1195
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:51,750
Yes.

1196
01:17:56,916 --> 01:18:00,666
Sir, this is the second
inning of a very senior writer.

1197
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:02,875
Believe me, sir.

1198
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,666
It will cause a sensation.
- Shall I tell you what sensation is?

1199
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:09,791
My serials are dubbed
and aired in 12 countries.

1200
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:12,000
My dramas have broken the TRP records.

1201
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:13,541
You see?

1202
01:18:14,291 --> 01:18:16,250
I won an award just last month.

1203
01:18:23,041 --> 01:18:26,625
Hence, my boy,
don't teach me what a sensation is.

1204
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:29,500
Sir, I want to bring
my passion into this drama.

1205
01:18:29,625 --> 01:18:32,500
Leave your passion in your pocket.
I merely want the script from you.

1206
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:33,666
Because people don't want passion.

1207
01:18:34,375 --> 01:18:35,375
They want entertainment.

1208
01:18:36,666 --> 01:18:40,250
The mantra for success
is to entertain people.

1209
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,291
Don't teach them how to live.

1210
01:18:42,666 --> 01:18:44,541
In any case,
what have you done before this?

1211
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:46,750
You have the face of a hero.

1212
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:49,000
Do a hero's job.
Act.

1213
01:18:49,416 --> 01:18:51,291
Actor, Producer, ticket-collector.

1214
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,625
You want to be everything?

1215
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:55,875
Sir, I..
- I will pay you for the script.

1216
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:57,625
Everything is okay.

1217
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:59,000
It just requires a few small changes.
I will get them done myself.

1218
01:19:00,041 --> 01:19:01,250
Tell me the number of episodes.

1219
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,666
21, sir.
- We shall do 45.

1220
01:19:04,916 --> 01:19:06,125
My team is very fast.

1221
01:19:06,666 --> 01:19:08,500
They have done 20 scenes in 11 hours.

1222
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,125
Sorry, sir.

1223
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:12,041
It can't be stretched.

1224
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:14,500
In that case, my boy, why don't you..

1225
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:16,750
..Pull the chain in
the train and get off?

1226
01:19:17,375 --> 01:19:19,666
People come out of the
woodwork to waste my time.

1227
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,500
Hello.

1228
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:21,291
Hello.

1229
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,791
Yes, Sheheryar. What is it?

1230
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:24,791
Thank you..

1231
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:26,750
..Dad.

1232
01:21:27,125 --> 01:21:27,916
For what?

1233
01:21:29,875 --> 01:21:31,250
For everything.

1234
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:33,416
Silly chap.

1235
01:21:33,666 --> 01:21:37,666
When I taught you to run,
why wouldn't I teach you to fly?

1236
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:41,500
Best of luck!

1237
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:47,750
I'll leave now, uncle.

1238
01:21:48,416 --> 01:21:49,375
Thank you very much.

1239
01:21:53,666 --> 01:21:54,875
Uncle

1240
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,666
what about the money?
- What money?

1241
01:21:59,666 --> 01:22:02,750
I mean for the script writing

1242
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:07,500
You want to compensate me.

1243
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,500
Let's just assume
you have made a deposit..

1244
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:13,750
..And now I shall reap the interest.

1245
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:15,875
Just Produce the drama.

1246
01:22:17,416 --> 01:22:18,791
I won't let you down, sir.

1247
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,125
Don't let yourself down, son.

1248
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:31,666
I ordered pizza.
I'll go check on it.

1249
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,375
Arshad. Arshad.
The sofa is here for the new office.

1250
01:22:35,416 --> 01:22:36,666
Come quick.
Please!

1251
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:38,666
Okay. Okay.
- Come. Come. Hurry up!

1252
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:43,125
This..

1253
01:22:45,666 --> 01:22:46,500
You?

1254
01:22:52,125 --> 01:22:54,250
I wanted to apologize
for losing my temper.

1255
01:23:09,375 --> 01:23:09,916
Sit.

1256
01:23:15,416 --> 01:23:16,666
Personal delivery.

1257
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:22,125
My wedding card.

1258
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,791
I sent sweets to your home.

1259
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,791
You should have sent salt as well.

1260
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:34,291
I'd rub it on my wounds.

1261
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:42,500
I want to tell you something else too.

1262
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:45,666
What is it?

1263
01:23:54,041 --> 01:23:56,500
Father is unwell, Sheheryar.

1264
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:02,750
His brain tumor is malignant.

1265
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:04,125
What?

1266
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:15,625
He wants to see me settled
before he passes away.

1267
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:22,416
And I want to give him
this joy no matter what.

1268
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:29,666
That's why I..

1269
01:24:30,625 --> 01:24:32,541
..Did not have much time, Sheheryar.

1270
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:39,125
But I didn't want to emotionally
blackmail you by telling you this.

1271
01:24:39,625 --> 01:24:41,791
Uncle Faisal didn't mention it either.

1272
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,625
He does not like anyone
feeling sorry for him.

1273
01:25:04,375 --> 01:25:08,041
Getting married is more difficult
than setting up your office.

1274
01:25:10,291 --> 01:25:11,541
I need help.

1275
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:14,125
Shall I send Shabbo?

1276
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:15,666
Why?

1277
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,250
Can't you be my friend?

1278
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:23,375
What would I gain?

1279
01:25:25,416 --> 01:25:26,125
Me.

1280
01:25:28,125 --> 01:25:29,250
For a few days.

1281
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:32,125
In Kashmir.

1282
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:34,875
Kashmir?

1283
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,875
It is dad's wish..

1284
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,666
..That I get married
in his ancestral village.

1285
01:25:41,666 --> 01:25:42,791
Ancestral village?

1286
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,375
Arshad, look at this.
- Why don't you go

1287
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:48,666
solve all the problems first?

1288
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:49,875
We will make the drama later.

1289
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,250
Listen to me.
- No. No. Go to Kashmir.

1290
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,125
Go there and shop for the wedding.

1291
01:25:54,166 --> 01:25:55,375
Get henna applied on your hands.

1292
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:57,666
Moreover, be Saniya's
girlfriend and play the drums.

1293
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:59,125
Also, collect a couple of 'vele' too.

1294
01:25:59,416 --> 01:26:01,666
Saniya has returned?
- Yes, Saniya returns.

1295
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:02,875
Just like the horror film.

1296
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:04,791
Do you know how much work is required?

1297
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,625
We haven't organized the
audition for the female lead as yet.

1298
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:08,625
Production design.
Interviews of the cast and crew.

1299
01:26:08,666 --> 01:26:10,000
But all you care about
is being a girlfriend.

1300
01:26:10,041 --> 01:26:12,375
I cannot say no to
her at this time, buddy.

1301
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,041
In any case,
this will only take up two weeks.

1302
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:16,500
It takes 2 seconds to lose
an opportunity, Mr. Sheheryar..

1303
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:18,666
..And you have toiled
years for this opportunity.

1304
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,125
Arshad, relax.

1305
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:21,750
I see.

1306
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:25,291
So, we worked this hard so that
when the destination is in front of us..

1307
01:26:25,375 --> 01:26:26,500
..We would relax and go to sleep!

1308
01:26:26,541 --> 01:26:28,125
Arshad, you are overreacting.

1309
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:30,125
I am only being a friend.

1310
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:31,625
Are we your foes?

1311
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:33,500
You know what?
Go and make the drama over there.

1312
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:34,875
The father is the writer anyway.

1313
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:36,416
Retain the daughter as Director..

1314
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:37,666
..And Hasan as the Producer!

1315
01:26:41,875 --> 01:26:43,375
What the hell!

1316
01:26:43,791 --> 01:26:45,875
Sheheryar, he is correct.

1317
01:26:46,291 --> 01:26:48,250
Understand your priorities.

1318
01:26:48,666 --> 01:26:50,500
That's exactly what I am trying to do.

1319
01:27:52,916 --> 01:27:53,666
What's the matter?

1320
01:27:55,666 --> 01:27:57,916
I hope you haven't fallen in love.

1321
01:27:58,875 --> 01:28:00,041
Don't do it.

1322
01:28:02,666 --> 01:28:05,416
It took me so long
to know what love means.

1323
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:09,666
It will probably take
me a lifetime to forget.

1324
01:28:09,916 --> 01:28:12,125
Life has rules, Mr. Sheheryar.

1325
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:15,041
Life has conditions and destiny is ours.

1326
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:17,416
That's why friendship is best.

1327
01:28:17,666 --> 01:28:20,000
One does not have to depend
on either conditions or destiny.

1328
01:28:26,125 --> 01:28:27,750
I want to tell you something.

1329
01:28:31,291 --> 01:28:32,375
My dad..

1330
01:28:33,791 --> 01:28:34,875
My real dad..

1331
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:38,875
..Did not love me at all.

1332
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:42,666
But I loved him very much.

1333
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:48,625
Early one morning a sound woke me up.

1334
01:28:50,666 --> 01:28:52,125
I was very young back then..

1335
01:28:53,666 --> 01:28:56,000
..But even today I recall
that moment like it was yesterday.

1336
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:02,416
When I looked down from
the top of the stairs..

1337
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:06,125
..I saw a suitcase next
to the front door of my house.

1338
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:08,750
Then I saw dad.

1339
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:12,500
He was looking at me.

1340
01:29:14,125 --> 01:29:17,666
That day he had a strange
smile on his lips.

1341
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:22,666
He picked up the suitcase and left.

1342
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:31,125
I never saw him again since that day.

1343
01:29:32,541 --> 01:29:35,125
A picture of mom and
him was around for a few days.

1344
01:29:35,666 --> 01:29:36,875
Frozen in time.

1345
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:39,666
But even that picture
was removed after a while.

1346
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:46,666
But till date nobody
told me why he left us.

1347
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:52,625
That's why marriage..the
concept of a long-term commitment..

1348
01:29:55,125 --> 01:29:56,750
..Seems very meaningless to me.

1349
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:00,416
Because..

1350
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:03,666
..I my own life taught
me something else.

1351
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,875
Bring one more cup of tea.

1352
01:30:26,541 --> 01:30:28,125
Oh! Stop it, Arshad.

1353
01:30:28,666 --> 01:30:31,125
We didn't come here to
shoot the last scene of Devdas.

1354
01:30:31,791 --> 01:30:33,875
And if you love Sheheryar so much..

1355
01:30:34,166 --> 01:30:35,375
..Then why did you fight with him?

1356
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:37,375
I got scolded too without reason.

1357
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:38,500
Don't be crazy.

1358
01:30:39,666 --> 01:30:41,125
He is a loser!

1359
01:30:42,666 --> 01:30:44,250
Why are you acting like a hero?

1360
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:47,666
Even you came here when
Saniya made one call to you.

1361
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:50,791
You just know to talk big.

1362
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:17,375
Sorry.

1363
01:31:18,666 --> 01:31:19,916
Sorry, buddy.

1364
01:31:25,375 --> 01:31:28,791
I shall pay thousands
of rupees for your tea.

1365
01:31:29,375 --> 01:31:31,041
Producers like you..

1366
01:31:31,625 --> 01:31:33,625
..Always make us suffer losses.

1367
01:31:36,875 --> 01:31:37,500
Listen.

1368
01:31:37,541 --> 01:31:38,875
Can we go to buy clothes now?

1369
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:20,625
"The shelter sought by the heart,
was found on the shore."

1370
01:32:20,666 --> 01:32:24,750
"Lonely was the heart by itself."

1371
01:32:24,875 --> 01:32:29,000
"Until it found another like itself."

1372
01:32:29,041 --> 01:32:33,291
"Without words, the eyes have spoken."

1373
01:32:33,375 --> 01:32:37,500
"Slowly and slowly these hearts connect."

1374
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:45,750
"O my beloved, don't beguile me."

1375
01:32:45,791 --> 01:32:50,125
"Without words, the eyes have spoken."

1376
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:54,500
"Slowly and slowly these hearts connect"

1377
01:32:54,541 --> 01:33:01,291
"O my beloved, don't beguile me."

1378
01:33:04,666 --> 01:33:06,666
Aren't you glad we bought
the flowers real cheap?

1379
01:33:06,875 --> 01:33:08,125
Who says the flowers are cheap?

1380
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:10,500
The way you were buying like flowers
it seemed like it was your wedding.

1381
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:12,416
That's why you aren't married.
- Get lost.

1382
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:13,625
You are very stingy.

1383
01:33:14,041 --> 01:33:14,666
Sheheryar.

1384
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:16,375
Look, I brought more flowers.

1385
01:33:16,875 --> 01:33:17,625
Put them up.

1386
01:33:18,291 --> 01:33:20,416
Hey, bro.
Stop acting like a girlfriend..

1387
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:23,375
..Else her children will call you aunt.

1388
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:24,500
Stop it.

1389
01:33:25,291 --> 01:33:26,291
There's a piano behind you, bro.

1390
01:33:26,375 --> 01:33:29,000
Play it and sing, "I am happy.
Ignore the tears."

1391
01:33:29,041 --> 01:33:30,000
Silence, Arshad.

1392
01:33:30,041 --> 01:33:31,375
Never mind him, Sheheryar.

1393
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:34,000
Just put up flowers over here.
They're all bunched up in one place.

1394
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:35,500
Put some up over there as well.

1395
01:33:36,625 --> 01:33:37,250
Sheheryar.

1396
01:33:40,375 --> 01:33:41,125
Sheheryar.

1397
01:33:43,125 --> 01:33:44,750
Sheheryar, listen to me.

1398
01:33:45,791 --> 01:33:47,666
Brother Arshad, I have a problem.

1399
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:48,541
Don't take stress.

1400
01:33:48,666 --> 01:33:49,666
I know a Doctor.

1401
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:51,791
He will give you one pill and things
will be okay for five to six hours.

1402
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,125
Oh, no, bro! Not that.
- What then?

1403
01:33:54,291 --> 01:33:55,291
The priest ran off.

1404
01:33:55,875 --> 01:33:56,791
The priest ran off?

1405
01:33:57,041 --> 01:33:58,666
Although it's the bride
who should have run away.

1406
01:33:58,750 --> 01:33:59,416
What?

1407
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:01,625
I mean to say,
why did the priest run away?

1408
01:34:01,791 --> 01:34:03,666
He's been selected
for a game show in Dubai.

1409
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:24,375
"I always delay matters."

1410
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:26,375
"To do any task."

1411
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,250
"Whether I have to
say something important."

1412
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:34,500
"Whether I have to fulfill a promise."

1413
01:34:37,416 --> 01:34:39,500
"Whether I have to call out to her."

1414
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:42,750
"Whether I have to call her back."

1415
01:34:44,375 --> 01:34:47,000
"I always delay matters."

1416
01:34:54,666 --> 01:34:56,625
"Whether I have to help her."

1417
01:34:58,916 --> 01:35:01,250
"Whether I have to console a friend."

1418
01:35:03,416 --> 01:35:09,291
"Whether I have to go
see someone on bygone roads."

1419
01:35:10,791 --> 01:35:14,000
"I always delay matters."

1420
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:21,041
"Whether I have to accustom
myself to the changing weather."

1421
01:35:22,875 --> 01:35:25,125
"Whether I have to remember someone."

1422
01:35:26,125 --> 01:35:28,500
"Whether I have to forget someone."

1423
01:35:29,291 --> 01:35:33,125
"I always delay matters."

1424
01:35:35,125 --> 01:35:40,375
"Whether I have to protect
someone before death."

1425
01:35:40,875 --> 01:35:43,375
"Whether I have to go and tell her."

1426
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:47,541
"That the facts were different."

1427
01:35:49,125 --> 01:35:52,750
"I always delay matters."

1428
01:35:53,291 --> 01:35:57,625
"I always delay matters."

1429
01:36:13,916 --> 01:36:17,375
It looks so good on Saniya, doesn't it?

1430
01:36:18,125 --> 01:36:18,875
Come in.

1431
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:23,041
Please leave the room.

1432
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:26,041
Now!

1433
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:43,250
I hope everything is okay.

1434
01:37:00,208 --> 01:37:01,375
Saniya.

1435
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:08,375
Please marry me.

1436
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,250
Or I shall die.
- No.

1437
01:37:13,125 --> 01:37:14,666
Please don't do this.

1438
01:37:15,541 --> 01:37:16,875
It is too late, Sheheryar.

1439
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:18,125
Saniya!

1440
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:21,000
Open the door, Saniya!
- Please go away.

1441
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:22,666
Saniya!
- Please go away, Sheheryar.

1442
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:25,500
Open the door!
- I have been trying to go for so long.

1443
01:37:25,541 --> 01:37:27,666
Saniya!
- Please, Saniya.

1444
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:31,250
Open the door!
- I cannot go on without you.

1445
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:32,666
Saniya!

1446
01:37:33,125 --> 01:37:34,375
Sheheryar.

1447
01:37:34,875 --> 01:37:37,041
I will convince Faisal Uncle.

1448
01:37:37,375 --> 01:37:38,916
I will apologize to Hasan.

1449
01:37:39,125 --> 01:37:41,750
I will grovel and beg him!
- Open the door!

1450
01:37:41,791 --> 01:37:43,125
No.
- Please don't do it.

1451
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:44,750
Saniya!
- Please don't do this.

1452
01:37:44,875 --> 01:37:46,000
Saniya! Please!

1453
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Please take a step in my direction!

1454
01:37:50,125 --> 01:37:51,125
Saniya!

1455
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,625
Don't stop your steps!

1456
01:37:53,666 --> 01:37:54,875
Don't do it, Sheheryar.

1457
01:37:55,041 --> 01:37:57,041
Please!
- Please don't do this.

1458
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,416
Open the door!

1459
01:38:11,041 --> 01:38:12,375
Saniya, uncle Faisal..

1460
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:48,875
"Do not overlook my misery,"

1461
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:55,291
"Do not overlook my misery,"

1462
01:39:55,375 --> 01:40:01,666
"by blandishing your
eyes and weaving tales,"

1463
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:07,875
"Do not overlook my misery,"

1464
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:14,375
"by blandishing your
eyes and weaving tales,"

1465
01:40:26,958 --> 01:40:33,125
"Do not overlook my misery,"

1466
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:39,750
"by blandishing your
eyes and weaving tales,"

1467
01:40:39,875 --> 01:40:45,750
"by blandishing your
eyes and weaving tales,"

1468
01:40:45,791 --> 01:40:52,000
"by blandishing your
eyes and weaving tales,"

1469
01:40:52,125 --> 01:40:58,375
"by blandishing your
eyes and weaving tales,"

1470
01:40:58,416 --> 01:41:04,500
"by blandishing your
eyes and weaving tales,"

1471
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:09,875
"My patience has over-brimmed,
O sweetheart!"

1472
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:15,125
"My patience has over-brimmed,
O sweetheart!"

1473
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:20,500
"Why do you not take me to your bosom."

1474
01:41:20,541 --> 01:41:25,541
"My patience has over-brimmed,
O sweetheart!"

1475
01:41:25,625 --> 01:41:30,666
"Why do you not take me to your bosom."

1476
01:41:51,916 --> 01:41:55,833
"Oh my friend,"

1477
01:41:56,291 --> 01:42:00,416
"my beloved finally came home."

1478
01:42:00,958 --> 01:42:09,041
"Finally my courtyard was blessed."

1479
01:42:14,666 --> 01:42:20,458
"My beloved, lock your gaze with mine."

1480
01:42:20,541 --> 01:42:25,458
"My beloved, lock your gaze with mine"

1481
01:42:25,541 --> 01:42:28,166
"Robbed me of my sleep"

1482
01:42:28,291 --> 01:42:31,916
"Kept me awake day and night"

1483
01:42:32,333 --> 01:42:38,291
"Awoke the bliss in my heart"

1484
01:42:38,333 --> 01:42:42,833
"Awoke the bliss in my heart"

1485
01:42:42,916 --> 01:42:45,791
"Robbed me of my sleep"

1486
01:42:45,833 --> 01:42:49,333
"Kept me awake day and night"

1487
01:42:50,041 --> 01:42:54,541
"My beloved, lock your gaze with mine"

1488
01:42:54,583 --> 01:42:57,708
"Robbed me of my sleep"

1489
01:42:57,791 --> 01:43:02,166
"Kept me awake day and night"

1490
01:43:18,916 --> 01:43:24,666
"I went out to play with colors of "holi,"

1491
01:43:24,791 --> 01:43:30,541
"My drape was neither bright, nor dark."

1492
01:43:30,583 --> 01:43:36,208
"The way you gazed at me,"

1493
01:43:36,291 --> 01:43:39,166
"My heart was filled with colors,"

1494
01:43:39,291 --> 01:43:42,416
"And I was engulfed in "holi"

1495
01:43:42,791 --> 01:43:45,708
"My heart was filled with colors,"

1496
01:43:45,791 --> 01:43:49,916
"And I was engulfed in "holi"

1497
01:43:49,958 --> 01:43:53,041
"My beloved,"

1498
01:43:53,166 --> 01:43:54,458
"My beloved,"

1499
01:43:54,541 --> 01:43:57,541
"l take all your misfortunes"

1500
01:43:57,666 --> 01:44:00,416
"For taking my sleep"

1501
01:44:00,458 --> 01:44:04,458
"and keeping me awake day and night"

1502
01:44:27,791 --> 01:44:32,541
"My beloved, lock your gaze with mine"

1503
01:44:32,583 --> 01:44:35,291
"Robbed me of my sleep"

1504
01:44:35,416 --> 01:44:39,458
"Kept me awake day and night"

1505
01:44:39,541 --> 01:44:44,166
"My beloved, lock your gaze with mine"

1506
01:44:44,333 --> 01:44:47,166
"Robbed me of my sleep"

1507
01:44:47,291 --> 01:44:51,958
"Kept me awake day and night"

1508
01:45:12,583 --> 01:45:16,041
"A cloud came up to me
and said whilst passing.."

1509
01:45:16,458 --> 01:45:19,083
"A splash of dew fell upon me.."

1510
01:45:19,666 --> 01:45:21,791
"..By the time the evening ended."

1511
01:45:24,791 --> 01:45:25,541
Listen.

1512
01:45:26,083 --> 01:45:27,333
Are you happy?

1513
01:45:29,458 --> 01:45:30,416
Very.

1514
01:45:31,541 --> 01:45:34,291
"I used to think there
is a world behind the door."

1515
01:45:34,541 --> 01:45:40,291
"The door closed and the
world stealthily crawled up to me."

1516
01:45:44,208 --> 01:45:48,416
"You are my world and I want
to be lost in the colors of this world."

1517
01:45:52,666 --> 01:45:53,291
Cut!

1518
01:45:53,666 --> 01:45:56,041
Whose phone rang? You broke the spell.

1519
01:45:56,916 --> 01:45:58,416
Mine was set on vibrator.

1520
01:46:02,541 --> 01:46:03,541
Sorry, boss.

1521
01:46:03,916 --> 01:46:05,416
I forgot to set it on silent.

1522
01:46:12,541 --> 01:46:13,916
Could you guys hold his phone?

1523
01:46:14,208 --> 01:46:15,583
Go and bring me tea.

1524
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:22,291
Get lost!

1525
01:46:24,041 --> 01:46:27,541
New TV sensation Sheheryar
Aziz is in a great hurry.

1526
01:46:27,666 --> 01:46:31,416
Creating a commotion with his
first drama wasn't enough for him.

1527
01:46:31,458 --> 01:46:34,291
According to sources
the secret of the chemistry..

1528
01:46:34,333 --> 01:46:37,916
..Between superstar Zeena and
him is their blooming friendship.

1529
01:46:45,041 --> 01:46:46,916
Saniya.
- Hi, Sheheryar.

1530
01:46:47,458 --> 01:46:48,416
Oh, wow!

1531
01:46:49,666 --> 01:46:50,791
How come you called after all this time?

1532
01:46:51,041 --> 01:46:51,916
Everything okay?

1533
01:46:52,791 --> 01:46:55,833
Actually I was busy doing a shot.

1534
01:46:55,916 --> 01:46:57,791
Oh!
I'm really sorry.

1535
01:46:58,583 --> 01:47:00,916
I was watching you on TV here in Izmir.

1536
01:47:01,041 --> 01:47:03,333
So, I thought I'd
call to congratulate you.

1537
01:47:03,541 --> 01:47:06,291
Your serial and you
have created a commotion.

1538
01:47:06,583 --> 01:47:07,666
Yes.

1539
01:47:07,916 --> 01:47:10,208
Uncle Faisal's script
was a phenomenal hit.

1540
01:47:11,666 --> 01:47:14,291
Anyway, let's talk when you're free.

1541
01:47:15,291 --> 01:47:16,041
Sure.

1542
01:47:34,416 --> 01:47:37,541
We hear you two are really
going to get married after this drama.

1543
01:47:38,541 --> 01:47:40,416
You know the media is habituated to..

1544
01:47:40,916 --> 01:47:42,166
Can I give you some breaking news?

1545
01:47:42,291 --> 01:47:43,291
Please do.
- Please do.

1546
01:47:43,333 --> 01:47:44,583
You heard right.

1547
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:48,916
We have really come
very close to each other.

1548
01:47:49,041 --> 01:47:51,958
And our families are
going to meet very soon.

1549
01:47:53,416 --> 01:47:54,041
You.

1550
01:47:54,416 --> 01:47:55,416
Bring the camera close.

1551
01:47:56,333 --> 01:47:57,333
Look at this.

1552
01:47:58,208 --> 01:47:58,916
This is real.

1553
01:47:59,541 --> 01:48:00,541
Not a part of the getup.

1554
01:48:02,541 --> 01:48:03,916
My ring!

1555
01:48:18,083 --> 01:48:20,333
Why did you have to say that?

1556
01:48:20,791 --> 01:48:24,166
We will run out of breath now but
the media won't run out of questions.

1557
01:48:38,666 --> 01:48:40,458
Please try to understand, Zeena.

1558
01:48:40,958 --> 01:48:43,416
I don't want the
media making up stories.

1559
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:45,583
I did not want it either.

1560
01:48:46,166 --> 01:48:47,416
That's why I did it.

1561
01:48:50,583 --> 01:48:52,458
That's not the point, Zeena.

1562
01:48:53,541 --> 01:48:55,791
It's just the privacy that I..

1563
01:48:55,958 --> 01:48:57,416
Shouldn't I be the one saying that?

1564
01:48:58,166 --> 01:49:00,041
Even Zeena listens
to stories every day..

1565
01:49:01,916 --> 01:49:05,291
..About simply being
a ladder for your career.

1566
01:49:07,041 --> 01:49:12,083
But if I'm unafraid of the
stories at this stage of my career..

1567
01:49:12,583 --> 01:49:14,041
..Then what are you afraid of?

1568
01:49:17,833 --> 01:49:19,166
Tell me the truth, Sheheryar.

1569
01:49:20,291 --> 01:49:22,166
Are you ready for this commitment?

1570
01:49:46,333 --> 01:49:48,541
I have high regard
for your courage, Zeena.

1571
01:49:50,833 --> 01:49:55,083
I am learning from you
how young men face the truth.

1572
01:49:58,791 --> 01:49:59,541
You're right.

1573
01:49:59,916 --> 01:50:01,583
I have no reason to be afraid of anyone.

1574
01:50:06,333 --> 01:50:07,541
Think about it once again.

1575
01:50:10,833 --> 01:50:12,083
Do you have any regrets?

1576
01:50:15,916 --> 01:50:17,958
I don't like birds
with clipped feathers.

1577
01:50:19,708 --> 01:50:23,416
The beauty of birds
lies in their feathers.

1578
01:50:25,333 --> 01:50:26,916
If they are clipped

1579
01:50:28,833 --> 01:50:30,541
what good is the bird?

1580
01:50:34,916 --> 01:50:36,541
Don't say that, Zeena.

1581
01:50:39,041 --> 01:50:40,541
You are my choice

1582
01:50:42,458 --> 01:50:44,083
as well as my inspiration.

1583
01:50:45,291 --> 01:50:48,291
And most importantly
now you are my commitment too.

1584
01:50:52,541 --> 01:50:54,541
I have reached you
after running for years.

1585
01:50:57,083 --> 01:50:59,583
I no longer want any
scope doubts in my decisions.

1586
01:51:14,791 --> 01:51:16,208
Mr. Chaudhry is here.

1587
01:51:18,333 --> 01:51:19,541
Mr. Chaudhry.

1588
01:51:19,916 --> 01:51:20,666
Welcome.

1589
01:51:22,333 --> 01:51:26,416
We've started promoting
your film before its launch.

1590
01:51:26,541 --> 01:51:28,583
Take a look on Instagram and twitter.

1591
01:51:28,916 --> 01:51:30,791
The news has spread like wildfire.

1592
01:51:30,916 --> 01:51:32,833
Fantastic! Fantastic!

1593
01:51:32,916 --> 01:51:38,041
Ever since I signed you I too have
become world famous is all of Chakwal.

1594
01:51:38,916 --> 01:51:40,708
Tell me this, Mr. Chaudhry.

1595
01:51:41,208 --> 01:51:44,791
We are coming back to Europe
next month to start our film, right?

1596
01:51:44,833 --> 01:51:45,708
Absolutely.

1597
01:51:45,791 --> 01:51:47,541
And the wedding sequence.

1598
01:51:47,666 --> 01:51:48,541
That's in it too, right?

1599
01:51:49,208 --> 01:51:49,958
That's in too.

1600
01:51:50,708 --> 01:51:51,708
I was thinking.

1601
01:51:52,541 --> 01:51:55,583
Why don't we merge fact and fiction..

1602
01:51:56,541 --> 01:51:58,916
..And turn it into a real wedding?

1603
01:51:59,916 --> 01:52:03,458
He will get his shoot and
we will have our destination wedding.

1604
01:52:04,541 --> 01:52:07,291
Beautiful location.
Actor couple.

1605
01:52:07,416 --> 01:52:10,291
And our families will be extras.

1606
01:52:13,416 --> 01:52:15,416
Double the entertainment for one ticket.

1607
01:52:15,666 --> 01:52:18,333
And the climax of your
film will get a boost.

1608
01:52:18,416 --> 01:52:20,041
What an idea, Zeena!

1609
01:52:20,166 --> 01:52:22,416
You really put your finger
on the pulse of the audiences.

1610
01:52:22,541 --> 01:52:23,333
That's right.

1611
01:52:23,416 --> 01:52:24,958
And on my Achilles heel.

1612
01:52:38,291 --> 01:52:39,541
Everything okay?

1613
01:52:44,291 --> 01:52:46,458
Then why are you so quiet?

1614
01:52:50,666 --> 01:52:52,333
I'm very sorry, Hasan.

1615
01:52:54,333 --> 01:52:55,666
Sorry.
For what?

1616
01:53:00,541 --> 01:53:02,166
I can't marry you.

1617
01:53:07,208 --> 01:53:08,541
This compromise..

1618
01:53:10,666 --> 01:53:14,208
..Which we are trying
to change into a bond..

1619
01:53:16,333 --> 01:53:17,791
..I can't do it.

1620
01:53:19,666 --> 01:53:22,833
Saniya, you see our
love as a compromise?

1621
01:53:22,916 --> 01:53:24,958
There is no love, Hasan.

1622
01:53:26,708 --> 01:53:28,833
That's why it feels like compromise.

1623
01:53:45,291 --> 01:53:46,458
Hassan.

1624
01:53:48,708 --> 01:53:50,833
Why were you in this relationship
if you did not love me, Saniya?

1625
01:53:51,583 --> 01:53:52,916
Perhaps fear.

1626
01:53:53,666 --> 01:53:54,541
Of what?

1627
01:53:55,166 --> 01:53:58,583
That nobody would be able
to take such good care of me.

1628
01:53:59,291 --> 01:54:00,833
That is not fear.
It is selfishness.

1629
01:54:01,416 --> 01:54:04,083
Even selfishness is borne out of fear.

1630
01:54:05,791 --> 01:54:10,291
I might never find a person
as nice as you in all my life.

1631
01:54:11,833 --> 01:54:13,791
But what do I do with this heart..

1632
01:54:15,041 --> 01:54:18,083
..Which loves the
truth more than niceness.

1633
01:54:18,958 --> 01:54:21,041
Hasan, I love Sheheryar.

1634
01:54:32,833 --> 01:54:34,291
And our relationship.

1635
01:54:35,291 --> 01:54:36,708
Was it a lie?

1636
01:54:37,666 --> 01:54:39,083
Believe me.

1637
01:54:41,458 --> 01:54:43,791
I really tried to make it work..

1638
01:54:46,291 --> 01:54:47,833
..But for some unknown reason..

1639
01:54:48,791 --> 01:54:51,208
..All of this feels like a lie to me.

1640
01:54:52,041 --> 01:54:58,166
A lie can be fair in love and war,
not in friendship.

1641
01:54:59,916 --> 01:55:01,083
Okay, friend.

1642
01:55:01,791 --> 01:55:03,958
I release you from my love.

1643
01:55:11,583 --> 01:55:13,291
When you've learned all these facts..

1644
01:55:14,166 --> 01:55:15,583
..Tell me one more fact.

1645
01:55:18,666 --> 01:55:22,041
What are you doing over
here after learning all of this?

1646
01:55:48,791 --> 01:55:51,708
Gate crash situation
since you are successful

1647
01:55:52,041 --> 01:55:53,083
You're here?

1648
01:55:53,791 --> 01:55:55,291
Finally, you thought about your parents.

1649
01:56:01,083 --> 01:56:03,333
Earlier I used to see you every Sunday..

1650
01:56:03,416 --> 01:56:06,291
..Whereas now I spot you
in a magazine every Sunday.

1651
01:56:06,416 --> 01:56:09,541
Our only son has
decided to get married..

1652
01:56:09,666 --> 01:56:12,541
..And we learn it
from anti-social media.

1653
01:56:12,916 --> 01:56:15,208
Why didn't I simply
drown in handful of water?

1654
01:56:15,333 --> 01:56:19,208
Mom, you wouldn't swim in handful of water,
so, you certainly can't drown in it.

1655
01:56:19,333 --> 01:56:20,791
Do you want to challenge her?

1656
01:56:20,833 --> 01:56:21,833
You be quiet.

1657
01:56:22,666 --> 01:56:25,958
At least one's luck can drown.

1658
01:56:26,041 --> 01:56:27,333
I am getting married.

1659
01:56:27,416 --> 01:56:28,916
I am not divorcing you.

1660
01:56:29,083 --> 01:56:32,583
Isn't this what you wanted anyway?
Stop crying now.

1661
01:56:33,166 --> 01:56:35,208
It's not good to spill so many tears.

1662
01:56:35,541 --> 01:56:36,958
My son has grown so big.

1663
01:56:37,833 --> 01:56:38,958
He is getting married.

1664
01:56:41,333 --> 01:56:42,708
He is getting married.

1665
01:56:44,041 --> 01:56:46,083
Hush. Hush.

1666
01:56:46,541 --> 01:56:48,541
I must admit she is a good actress..

1667
01:56:48,791 --> 01:56:51,666
..But I don't know how
she will play the role of a wife.

1668
01:56:53,541 --> 01:56:55,083
We shall write the script together.

1669
01:56:55,208 --> 01:56:58,916
We shall keep her away from both,
conspiracy and white magic.

1670
01:57:00,416 --> 01:57:02,583
You can talk to me candidly.

1671
01:57:03,666 --> 01:57:08,666
Is it coercion,
an incident or perhaps a mistake?

1672
01:57:09,291 --> 01:57:11,666
Oh, no.
Nothing of that sort.

1673
01:57:14,541 --> 01:57:15,916
You love her?

1674
01:57:16,541 --> 01:57:17,458
Obviously, mom.

1675
01:57:17,541 --> 01:57:19,291
Why would I marry
her if I didn't love her?

1676
01:57:20,583 --> 01:57:22,666
He is in love.

1677
01:57:22,791 --> 01:57:25,083
He is in love.

1678
01:57:25,541 --> 01:57:26,833
Anyway, tell me.

1679
01:57:27,041 --> 01:57:28,541
What will you wear to the wedding?

1680
01:57:28,916 --> 01:57:34,541
The Umar Sayeed sari, which
I wore in episode 6 of 'Aunty 420.'

1681
01:57:34,666 --> 01:57:36,500
I got 4000 likes.

1682
01:57:36,541 --> 01:57:38,541
I got 4000 likes.

1683
01:57:39,791 --> 01:57:41,458
Congratulations! She has agreed.

1684
01:57:41,541 --> 01:57:43,916
May God bless her dress!
- Amen!

1685
01:57:43,958 --> 01:57:45,041
Thank you, God!

1686
01:58:01,458 --> 01:58:04,583
Arshad, please get that.
It might be my trousers.

1687
01:58:06,291 --> 01:58:07,333
Check the string.

1688
01:58:07,583 --> 01:58:08,416
Otherwise we need to put sneakers laces

1689
01:58:08,541 --> 01:58:10,583
I became a Director to open doors.

1690
01:58:13,791 --> 01:58:14,958
Damn!

1691
01:58:23,291 --> 01:58:23,958
You?

1692
01:58:25,166 --> 01:58:26,291
Oops! Sorry.

1693
01:58:26,416 --> 01:58:27,666
You aren't ready.

1694
01:58:30,458 --> 01:58:32,833
Catching me off guard
is an old habit with you.

1695
01:58:35,416 --> 01:58:37,541
I'll go check in the laundry.

1696
01:58:37,708 --> 01:58:38,708
Trouser.

1697
01:58:45,833 --> 01:58:49,083
I am going to check on the frame.
- Okay.

1698
01:58:54,458 --> 01:58:55,916
What brings you here?

1699
01:59:02,208 --> 01:59:03,666
I came to be a friend.

1700
01:59:05,916 --> 01:59:07,333
I have to repay the debt.

1701
01:59:09,791 --> 01:59:10,708
Can I help?

1702
01:59:11,791 --> 01:59:12,583
Look.

1703
01:59:13,208 --> 01:59:14,416
I am unable to tie it.

1704
01:59:16,666 --> 01:59:17,833
Where has Sun gone now?

1705
01:59:17,916 --> 01:59:19,791
The weather in this country
changes every minute.

1706
01:59:19,833 --> 01:59:21,416
Tell him,
so what if this is a real wedding.

1707
01:59:21,458 --> 01:59:23,041
I cannot change the
script at the last moment.

1708
01:59:23,791 --> 01:59:25,791
Anyone comes along at any time.
Go and tell him.

1709
01:59:26,291 --> 01:59:28,416
Wow! This is the same
one from Mera Sultan, isn't it?

1710
01:59:28,541 --> 01:59:29,541
If it turns out to be another one..!

1711
01:59:48,291 --> 01:59:49,541
Why are you looking
at me in that manner?

1712
01:59:50,791 --> 01:59:51,916
I am looking to see..

1713
01:59:52,791 --> 01:59:55,083
..If the words you
expressed to me were lies..

1714
01:59:55,791 --> 01:59:59,791
..Or did Zeena love you so much,
it changed your mind.

1715
02:00:02,166 --> 02:00:04,541
Regrettably, neither was that a lie..

1716
02:00:05,666 --> 02:00:06,583
..Nor is this a lie.

1717
02:00:09,541 --> 02:00:11,083
Then why the regret?

1718
02:00:14,083 --> 02:00:14,916
I should go.

1719
02:00:18,458 --> 02:00:19,416
How is Hasan?

1720
02:00:23,041 --> 02:00:24,208
I don't know.

1721
02:00:24,666 --> 02:00:26,041
Meaning?

1722
02:00:27,583 --> 02:00:29,416
Meaning it's over between us.

1723
02:00:30,291 --> 02:00:31,458
Why?

1724
02:00:31,666 --> 02:00:33,416
Because he knows.

1725
02:00:34,291 --> 02:00:35,083
What?

1726
02:00:37,916 --> 02:00:39,416
That I..

1727
02:00:41,916 --> 02:00:44,166
That I am in love with someone else.

1728
02:01:01,208 --> 02:01:02,541
Your trouser.

1729
02:01:03,083 --> 02:01:04,333
I don't want it!

1730
02:02:22,708 --> 02:02:24,791
Come over here.

1731
02:02:39,708 --> 02:02:41,791
Call the gaffer quickly.
The light has to be put up.

1732
02:02:41,833 --> 02:02:44,416
Hey, Turkish Ayesha Omar
Give me today's storyboard.

1733
02:02:44,458 --> 02:02:45,583
Hurry up and bring me tea.

1734
02:02:48,291 --> 02:02:49,458
You spat into it, didn't you?

1735
02:02:51,416 --> 02:02:52,041
Lights!

1736
02:02:52,708 --> 02:02:53,583
Camera!

1737
02:02:54,916 --> 02:02:56,041
Action!

1738
02:03:04,416 --> 02:03:06,041
He is stoned.

1739
02:03:11,666 --> 02:03:15,541
She looks so pretty!
Will you look at her?

1740
02:03:27,291 --> 02:03:28,291
Cut!

1741
02:03:29,541 --> 02:03:31,958
I need a safety take.

1742
02:03:37,791 --> 02:03:39,416
Zeena baby is very happy.

1743
02:03:39,458 --> 02:03:41,666
Only fortunate people
have weddings like this.

1744
02:03:41,708 --> 02:03:44,083
Mr. Chaudhry made all the arrangements.

1745
02:03:44,208 --> 02:03:45,958
The jewelry as well
as the bridal attire.

1746
02:03:46,041 --> 02:03:47,291
Exactly.

1747
02:03:47,416 --> 02:03:49,541
No expenses for the video either.

1748
02:03:50,333 --> 02:03:52,166
The real reception
will take place in Karachi.

1749
02:03:52,666 --> 02:03:55,083
Because our relatives did not come here.

1750
02:03:55,208 --> 02:03:56,458
Thank God they didn't come.

1751
02:03:56,541 --> 02:03:57,541
Never mind.

1752
02:03:57,583 --> 02:03:58,916
A Turkey is a Turkey.

1753
02:04:03,666 --> 02:04:05,041
Very nice jacket.

1754
02:04:05,166 --> 02:04:07,500
Versace?
- Oh, no. Karachi.

1755
02:04:07,541 --> 02:04:09,041
I have no secrets from you, uncle.

1756
02:04:09,208 --> 02:04:10,166
Bought it from charity market

1757
02:04:10,291 --> 02:04:12,416
Thanks to English man of my size

1758
02:04:12,541 --> 02:04:14,541
He died at the right time.

1759
02:04:17,291 --> 02:04:20,166
My child! Go on, my son.
Go eat some Baklawa.

1760
02:04:21,166 --> 02:04:21,833
Good idea.

1761
02:04:22,291 --> 02:04:25,791
One should get them used
to eating Foreign Aid from childhood.

1762
02:04:25,916 --> 02:04:28,041
Are you from Lahore?
- Do you want to go?

1763
02:04:28,291 --> 02:04:30,541
What are you saying, sir?

1764
02:04:30,583 --> 02:04:34,541
I am so well-known,
so very well-known in Lahore..

1765
02:04:34,583 --> 02:04:39,708
..If you were to enter Bhaati gate,
you will find tiny little pebbles.

1766
02:04:41,666 --> 02:04:44,541
When they see you they will greet you..

1767
02:04:44,583 --> 02:04:45,791
..But don't get scared.

1768
02:04:45,916 --> 02:04:47,166
No.
Never ever!

1769
02:04:47,458 --> 02:04:50,708
Just ask them where Pabbi,
the wrestler lives.

1770
02:04:50,791 --> 02:04:54,041
Believe me each and every
pebble will smile and tell you..

1771
02:04:54,083 --> 02:04:55,958
..Pabbi, the wrestler lives over there.

1772
02:05:07,833 --> 02:05:11,041
Wow! My son looks handsome!

1773
02:05:11,083 --> 02:05:12,666
He looked IMF'd.

1774
02:05:12,916 --> 02:05:16,291
Son, baby is very delicate.

1775
02:05:16,791 --> 02:05:18,916
Take care of her.

1776
02:05:21,333 --> 02:05:23,416
Just a minute.
Just a minute, aunty.

1777
02:05:23,583 --> 02:05:25,791
Save this performance for the camera.

1778
02:05:25,916 --> 02:05:26,666
Good!

1779
02:05:26,708 --> 02:05:28,708
She thinks she is Mahira Khan.
- Rolling.

1780
02:05:29,166 --> 02:05:30,416
With the mood.

1781
02:05:31,291 --> 02:05:32,041
Action!

1782
02:05:45,166 --> 02:05:48,291
When the stars brighten one by one.

1783
02:05:48,583 --> 02:05:51,916
Your steps come towards my destiny.

1784
02:06:07,916 --> 02:06:09,541
I hope you remember, Sheheryar..

1785
02:06:10,916 --> 02:06:14,791
..The beauty of birds
is in their feathers.

1786
02:06:25,541 --> 02:06:29,416
These were the only few moments
which were free from time's jail.

1787
02:06:36,250 --> 02:06:37,416
You will be missed

1788
02:06:37,833 --> 02:06:38,708
Really

1789
02:06:38,791 --> 02:06:41,416
Mr. Explorer Mr Discoverer

1790
02:07:00,541 --> 02:07:02,333
Hey! What is he doing?

1791
02:07:06,166 --> 02:07:08,083
Keep rolling the camera.
Don't cut it.

1792
02:07:11,291 --> 02:07:13,791
Turn camera toward brother in law

1793
02:07:48,458 --> 02:07:51,541
This is final call to board for Izmir

1794
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,083
Can we stay in touch?

1795
02:08:02,916 --> 02:08:04,083
Give me your number!

1796
02:08:04,833 --> 02:08:05,750
It's pointless.

1797
02:08:05,958 --> 02:08:08,750
You won't call and
I will wait without reason

1798
02:08:17,833 --> 02:08:33,291
"Who would care to go and report
this matter to my darling."

1799
02:08:34,416 --> 02:08:35,541
Last Call Madam

1800
02:09:06,166 --> 02:09:09,708
keep following him quietly, people should
beleive this is a real shooting..

1801
02:09:34,625 --> 02:09:36,791
Hey, cut it!

1802
02:09:37,333 --> 02:09:38,916
A gun has been fired!

1803
02:09:39,041 --> 02:09:40,666
Run Run, gun has been fired

1804
02:09:40,708 --> 02:09:42,958
Stop right now

1805
02:09:53,666 --> 02:09:56,541
Wow! That was an amazing climax.

1806
02:09:56,583 --> 02:09:58,458
By the way, we have everything here.

1807
02:09:58,541 --> 02:10:00,500
We have the stage.
We have the priest.

1808
02:10:00,541 --> 02:10:02,541
We have food as well as witnesses.

1809
02:10:03,041 --> 02:10:04,416
The lighting is perfect.

1810
02:10:04,458 --> 02:10:05,541
The frame is perfect.

1811
02:10:05,958 --> 02:10:08,708
But I am abashed.

1812
02:10:08,958 --> 02:10:12,541
Well, the couple is perfect,
my sweetie-pie.

1813
02:10:30,541 --> 02:10:45,541
Sleepless eyes, restless body,

1814
02:10:46,625 --> 02:10:51,333
I will apologise to Hasan this time.

1815
02:10:56,500 --> 02:11:03,083
This time don't stop
yourself from coming in my direction.

1816
02:11:13,041 --> 02:11:14,583
Zeena knows too.

1817
02:11:21,416 --> 02:11:22,666
What?

1818
02:11:23,958 --> 02:11:26,458
That I am in love with someone else.

1819
02:11:31,083 --> 02:11:32,291
And that wedding?

1820
02:11:32,666 --> 02:11:34,541
The filmy one took place with Zeena..

1821
02:11:35,666 --> 02:11:37,541
..As for the real one..

1822
02:11:39,291 --> 02:11:40,666
Will you marry me?

1823
02:11:50,541 --> 02:11:53,208
And what if you hide?

1824
02:11:57,333 --> 02:12:01,541
Come and find me if I hide.

1825
02:12:15,458 --> 02:12:16,916
I love you very much.

1826
02:12:17,541 --> 02:12:19,041
I love you more, Saniya.

1827
02:12:34,666 --> 02:12:43,041
"The shelter sought by the heart,
was found on the shore"

1828
02:12:43,166 --> 02:12:47,291
"Lonely was the heart by itself"

1829
02:12:47,416 --> 02:12:51,416
"Until it found another like itself"

1830
02:12:51,541 --> 02:12:55,791
"Without words, the eyes have spoken"

1831
02:12:55,833 --> 02:12:59,916
"Slowly and slowly these hearts connect"

1832
02:12:59,958 --> 02:13:07,916
"O my beloved, don't beguile me"
