1
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,425
- HurnPtY!

2
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,293
- HurnPtY!

3
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,233
Humpty, hurry up, bro...

4
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,467
It's almost time for your exam!

5
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,267
Stop pressurizing him, man!

6
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:40,106
You know he has trouble with...
pressure.

7
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,439
What are you doing, man?!

8
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,063
Stop wasting time...

9
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,361
You're done for in this exam, buddy.

10
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,726
<i>Chi“, Shanty...</i>

11
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:08,536
I know everything.

12
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,002
What is this, Humpty?

13
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,439
Sir! I've left everything
to the mercy of God!

14
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:22,677
Sir, my father says,
what you don't know, leave to God!

15
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,451
And I really don't know History...

16
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,080
so I've left it to God.

17
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,217
You're going to fail, man...

18
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:32,453
Listen to me. Copy a few answers.

19
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,797
Sir, my father says “no cheating.“
I can't break his trust.

20
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,767
Don't worry, sir!
God will handle everything!

21
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,671
Okay, sir? Jai Mata Di!

22
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,088
"Fool...
fool... fool... fool... fool..."

23
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,220
"Emotional Fool"

24
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,159
"Fool... fool... fool... fool..."

25
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,224
"Emotional Fool"

26
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,493
"Emotional..."

27
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:21,738
“You'll get in trouble if
you listen to this fraud of a heart“

28
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:25,639
“Oh, baby, my heart's a liar“

29
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:29,542
“Reciting Ghalib‘s poetry,
pretending he's a poet“

30
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,418
“Can't think of enough
curses to give him“

31
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,423
"Messes me up While it's acting cool"

32
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,430
“My heart is an emotional fool“

33
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:45,468
“My heart is an emotional fool“

34
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:49,404
“My heart is an emotional fool“

35
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:54,137
“My heart is an emotional fool“

36
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,371
"Fool...
fool... fool... fool... fool..."

37
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,140
"Emotional Fool"

38
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,375
"Fool... fool... fool... fool..."

39
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:13,528
“My heart gets lonely all by itself“

40
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:17,657
“After a few shots, confesses to me“

41
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:25,471
"All it wants is an Indian girl"

42
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:29,646
“And it wants me to set them up“

43
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,478
“A fun and whimsical damsel“

44
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:37,314
"Messes me up While it's acting cool"

45
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:41,550
“My heart is an emotional fool“

46
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,321
“My heart is an emotional fool“

47
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:49,364
“My heart is an emotional fool“

48
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:53,698
“My heart is an emotional fool“

49
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,556
“My heart's not a bad guy“

50
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:17,626
“Albeit a little unreliable“

51
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:25,498
“And so restless “

52
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:29,537
“So very restless“

53
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,265
“Does exactly what he wants“

54
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,536
“Without a spare thought for poor me“

55
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,671
"Messes me up While it's acting cool"

56
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:41,344
“My heart is an emotional fool“

57
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:45,389
“My heart is an emotional fool“

58
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,391
“My heart is an emotional fool“

59
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:55,795
“My heart is an emotional fool“

60
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,633
"Emotional..."

61
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:08,510
Chest... 44.

62
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,647
44!

63
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,412
Look, Mum.

64
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,085
Chest is still 44 inches.

65
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,621
Let your chest swell
up with pride, my son!

66
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,093
Like Sylvester Stallone!

67
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,555
Bansi! - Yes?

68
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,593
You've taken Kavya‘s measurements for her gown,
right?

69
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:29,361
No Ma‘am. Kavya and her sister
have gone to the cyber café.

70
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,526
How do you know?

71
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,203
Sir, they rushed off in front of me!

72
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,039
I told her I had to
take her measurements but...

73
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,267
Kavya said she
won't wear a local gown.

74
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,502
Really? - Hmm.

75
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,600
What a drama queen she is.

76
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,144
How do you like it?!

77
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,679
Screw you! You've got a designer gown!

78
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,314
Of course!
And it cost 2 and a half lakhs!

79
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:48,713
2 and a half lakhs!

80
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,083
How did you convince your dad?!

81
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,622
Emotional blackmail!

82
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,180
Papa, it's my only wedding!

83
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,621
I've always wanted this! Etc...

84
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,025
It's a great colour.

85
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:58,687
I know!

86
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,731
Did you talk to your dad yet?

87
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,691
My brother flips out anytime
I mention the designer gown!

88
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:04,696
And Dad starts laughing!

89
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:08,028
Kavya! Everyone must be
ready for breakfast... hurry up!

90
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,105
2 minutes, sis!

91
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,003
Just come to Delhi!

92
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,304
You can help me with the wedding
and you can buy your gown from here!

93
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,610
The showrooms are going to get the
latest stock of designer gowns, anyway!

94
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,176
Yeah! Great idea!

95
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,076
Okay, I'll call you later... Bye!

96
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,647
- Wants to book trucks for 4 nights, but won't give
an advance...

97
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,219
What a miser!

98
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,752
Let it go for now.

99
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:30,992
Dad!

100
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,654
We'll talk to Diwan after Diwali.

101
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,230
Why are you shouting?

102
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,730
Why didn't you give
your measurements today?

103
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,123
Dad, listen.

104
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,262
I will only get married
in Kareena Kapoor‘s designer gown.

105
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,632
Otherwise say ‘goodbye‘ to the groom!

106
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,701
Why such a fuss over a damn gown!

107
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,075
Son. Relax.

108
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,737
What's the problem with a local gown?

109
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,338
Grandma wore a local wedding gown.

110
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,042
Hmph! My mother-in-law selected it.

111
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,253
Horrible! With fake gold threading!

112
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,424
The jewelry set that
came with it was fake too!

113
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,354
Dad... I'm only going
to get married once.

114
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,951
I didn't get to choose the groom.

115
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,064
At least,
let me choose the wedding gown!

116
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,032
I didn't get to choose
my groom or my gown!

117
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,634
I've seen what happens
when people get to choose...

118
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,305
Dad, my wedding gown!

119
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,547
Okay, how much is it for?

120
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,512
Rs. 5 lakhs!

121
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,282
It was only 2 until yesterday,
now it's 5?!

122
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,750
Gurpreet‘s gown costs Rs.
2 and a half lakhs!

123
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,451
I deserve at least double that rate!

124
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,680
You can't wear something so expensive.

125
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,748
Look for something within Rs.
40-50 thousand.

126
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,991
Why are you being so cheap?!
We have so much money!

127
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,120
So what if we have money!

128
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,722
Next you'll ask for
a send off in a helicopter!

129
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,295
Money doesn't grow on trees!

130
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,160
Dad! - He's right.

131
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,533
Fine. I don't want your help.

132
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,209
I'll buy my gown myself.

133
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,469
Where are you going?!

134
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,178
Delhi! To Uncle's house!

135
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,678
I'll beg,
borrow, steal, but I'll get my gown!

136
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,744
If you want to rob,
do it here in Ambala?

137
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,412
Why do you need to go to Delhi?!

138
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,678
By the time I earn Rs.
5 lakhs in Ambala, I'll be an old lady.

139
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,583
You can earn big bucks
only in big cities.

140
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:13,259
Son... Call your uncle and tell him
Kavya‘s coming to stay for a few days.

141
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,429
OK.

142
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,328
Not just a few days!

143
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,491
I'm only coming back
after Gurpreet‘s wedding!

144
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,230
With. My. Gown!

145
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,635
Son... Stop taunting Swati.

146
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:31,982
Stopping the taunts,
won't heal the wounds, Mum.

147
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:39,682
Swati, please.

148
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,655
Don't say a word.

149
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,287
I fell in love with the wrong man.

150
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,552
Then I married him and humiliated dad.

151
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:45,718
I should be punished.

152
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,257
<i>What punishment, Swain!</i>

153
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,455
How is it your fault that
he turned out to be a scoundrel?

154
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,091
It IS my fault.

155
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,270
Dad tried to stop me,
but I didn't listen.

156
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,368
Mom.

157
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,168
Stop blaming yourself, child.

158
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,504
Some relationships are
meant to be short-lived.

159
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,144
It's the Almighty's decision.

160
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,577
Marrying Param was my decision, Mom.

161
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,116
God isn't responsible for my mistakes.

162
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,411
Forget about me.

163
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,616
Go have fun in Delhi for a month!

164
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,155
You won't get these days back.

165
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,461
Everything will be different in America.

166
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,620
Get a sexy wedding gown.

167
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,325
Whatever you do, don't land up in jail!

168
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,574
<i>Shanty!</i>

169
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,775
You're sure Mr. Shastri is going
to check the History paper, right?

170
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,576
How many times do I have to tell you?

171
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,385
I got the information
straight from the office.

172
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,352
He's been checking these
papers for the last 5 years!

173
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:52,522
Humpty! If the professor complains
about you, they'll fail you!

174
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,632
My dear Poplu...
I'm going to fail anyway, right?

175
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,036
Dude... since when
do you care about passing?!

176
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,340
Bro when heroes fail
their exams in movies...

177
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,642
their fathers give them a hug
and send them on vacations to London.

178
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:14,781
If I fail, my dad will kick
me and tell me to manage the bookstore.

179
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,384
Well, that's true...

180
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:17,618
Hey”

181
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,150
Good evening, Sir...

182
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,590
Bro, he looks like Thakur from Sholay!

183
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,694
Thakur didn't have hands, idiot.

184
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,397
He looks like the dancing girl!

185
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,198
Who are you GUYS?

186
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,574
Sir, I'm Tendulkar,
this is Kohli and that's Sehwag!

187
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,579
Look, boys. You'll look
like you'll are from a good home.

188
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:44,580
Thank you, sir!

189
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,308
Boys like you'll shouldn't
be doing such things.

190
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:52,185
Sir, when Gandhi's principles
don't work, use Al Capone's.

191
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,413
Sir, please pass me in History.

192
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,754
I don't mind scraping through.
I can pay you.

193
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,756
I don't accept bribes.

194
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:03,090
Just think of it as a donation...
I even wrote a poem for you!

195
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,667
One minute, sir. Listen.

196
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,505
"My daddy cry, if I fail,"

197
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,134
“Then I hit you and go to jail.“

198
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,375
“But don't worry, I get easy bail.“

199
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,646
“Then I again hit you, again jail“

200
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,340
“Again bail.“

201
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,742
“Jail-Bail, Jail-Bail, Jail-Bail“

202
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:24,614
“And one day...“

203
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,051
"Your heart fail."

204
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,116
WOW!

205
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:32,626
<i>Dye).!</i>

206
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,192
Monkey regiment! Come here!

207
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,370
Who are you?

208
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,341
Why are you messing
around with my Uncle?

209
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,603
Old man isn't passing me.

210
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,375
Hanging him like this
isn't going to help your cause.

211
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,572
He's not accepting my bribe. I offered!

212
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,474
How much?

213
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,176
Five Thousand rupees.

214
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,090
Do they need to pass?

215
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,982
Nah nah. They're working now.

216
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,321
Studying wasn't their thing.

217
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,754
Hmmm.

218
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,324
How will you get me passing marks?

219
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,061
My Aunt's out of town...

220
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,226
Uncle downs a few shots and passes out.

221
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,334
I check half the papers.

222
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,139
Give me your roll number,
I'll sort it out.

223
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,242
You're not from around here, are you?

224
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,512
I'm an alien. E.T.'s sister.

225
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,076
Why do you want to help me?

226
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,286
You see... it was love at first sight.

227
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,076
I want Rs. 10,000.

228
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,019
Are you insane?

229
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,182
If you want to bargain, you can get out.

230
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,249
You're dangerous.

231
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,383
I know.

232
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:38,625
Now, get out.

233
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,160
Humpty, hold on.

234
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,631
Come on, let's go.

235
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,064
What did the lady say?

236
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,626
She said, “Humpty, you'll pass.“

237
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:47,731
WOW!

238
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,637
Shonty, get the lowdown on her, man!

239
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,572
Shut up! I do the work
and you get the rewards!

240
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,507
What kind of friend are you, man!

241
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,708
What are you doing?!
You know my blood sugar is high!

242
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,035
We're celebrating your son passing
his exams! Don't worry... just eat!

243
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,478
H u mpty, you passed?!

244
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,345
Of course, sir! -But

245
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,051
Didn't I tell you?! God's on my team.

246
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,115
So, you passed!

247
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,491
Who did you copy from?

248
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,290
Dad! I'm your son!

249
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,363
I'd die before cheating!

250
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,430
Are you going to keep clowning around...

251
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,762
or will you manage the shop?

252
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,434
I'll manage it, Dad!

253
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,028
I'm young! It's my time to have fun!

254
00:14:55,227 --> 00:15:00,734
Correct! Now that you're here,
complete the inventory.

255
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,605
You always take advantage
of my innocence!

256
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,520
Bro. - Hmm.

257
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,421
Her name is Kavya Pratap Singh.

258
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,219
From Ambala.

259
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,122
She's Shastri‘s niece.

260
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,453
Her dad is in the transport business.

261
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:20,653
What's she doing in Delhi?

262
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,022
Wedding shopping.

263
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,365
She's engaged, man... to an NRI.

264
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:33,141
The Wedding's in a month and
a half and then straight to America.

265
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,339
Why are you looking so lovelorn?

266
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,180
Humpty!

267
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,221
Sorry dad! I've got to go!
Next week onwards, I promise!

268
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,051
Hello, Ms. Kavya!

269
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,145
Wow, you look like you're Size 0!

270
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:19,712
Are you mental?

271
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,216
Why are you wearing a
leather jacket in this heat?!

272
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,655
You're so judgmental!

273
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,492
I have high fever!
And I still came to say thank you!

274
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,089
Forget about it.
You've come to hit on me!

275
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,164
I don't hit on engaged property!

276
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,496
I've done my research!

277
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,197
Can't we sit and talk for a minute?

278
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,635
No! Say what you want to like this!

279
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,269
Well, you already know my name;
Humpty Sharma!

280
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,573
I'm very popular in my college!
Girls think I'm really cute...

281
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,309
Stop this introduction
and say what you need to!

282
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,009
There's a party...

283
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,524
There's a party at my college.

284
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,252
D.J... Drinks... delicious food.

285
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,356
So? - So, I'm inviting you!

286
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,059
Why me? Couldn't find anyone else?

287
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,599
Quite a few.
But you're the only one from Ambala.

288
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,595
Will I be going as your
sister or your girlfriend?

289
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,665
Whichever you like! I'm open minded!

290
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,605
Oh! My wedding is in 1 ‘/= months!

291
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:16,002
Oh. The party should
be over way before that.

292
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,046
What time?

293
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,377
6 pm onwards... you enter at 7!

294
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,319
Ms. Kavya! The dress code is western!

295
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,618
Don't show up in ethnic wear!

296
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,736
Humpty! She's here! Let's go! Quick!

297
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,133
I need to smell good!

298
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,706
You'll never change, man.

299
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,167
Let's go, let's goooo!

300
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,094
Who are you?

301
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,397
DJ Govind... Yo.

302
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,564
Listen, nerd. Can you handle this?

303
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,109
Yeah... Just give me a chance.

304
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:23,512
Come on.

305
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:55,643
"You can try and escape if you like"

306
00:18:56,034 --> 00:19:02,110
“But you know you can't
always have your way“

307
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,453
"You can go if you like"

308
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,687
“But you know what we
could get up to all night“

309
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,324
"I'm single, you're single"

310
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,956
“Let's get a little lucky tonight“

311
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:20,128
"I'm single, you're single"

312
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,696
“Let's get a little lucky tonight“

313
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,273
“Hand holding is so passé“

314
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,313
“Let's get a little lucky tonight“

315
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,184
“Let's get a little lucky tonight“

316
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,653
“Let's get a little lucky tonight“

317
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,529
“You hold commitment
at my throat like a knife“

318
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,695
“Like your personal chauffer,
behind you I drive“

319
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,370
“Used to be a hero in my college,
a real superstar“

320
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,773
"But your love's ruined me"

321
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,271
“When you dumped me, for a while I wept“

322
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:08,079
“But for the first time that night,
peacefully I slept“

323
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:11,186
“Things became crystal clear that night“

324
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:15,623
"I'm a macho man,
so let's get lucky tonight"

325
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:22,357
“Your luck is done,
boy, done, done, done“

326
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:27,231
“You have no idea how many suitors“

327
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,464
“Think I'm the one, one, one“

328
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,237
"I'm no stranger to how hearts work"

329
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,312
“There's a trail of
broken hearts wherever I go“

330
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,746
"I won't follow you"

331
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,579
“And I won't call you“

332
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:44,109
“And I won't be your lovesick puppy“

333
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,516
“Come, let me show you“

334
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,282
“Oh I can show you“

335
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,224
“A kind of love you won't forget“

336
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,388
"I'm single, you're single"

337
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:58,296
“Let's get a little lucky tonight“

338
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,270
"I'm single, you're single"

339
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,738
“Let's get a little lucky tonight“

340
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:08,044
“Hand holding is so passé“

341
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,339
“Let's get a little lucky tonight“

342
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,350
"I'm single, you're single"

343
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,253
“Let's get a little lucky tonight“

344
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,319
“Let's get a little lucky tonight“

345
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,690
“Let's get a little lucky tonight“

346
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,468
“Let's get a little lucky tonight“

347
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,770
“Let's get a little lucky tonight“

348
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:39,441
“Come, let's get a little lucky tonight“

349
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:46,809
I'm going!

350
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:47,573
What?

351
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,777
I'm going!

352
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,179
Why so early?!

353
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,518
She just got a call... There's a curfew!

354
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,520
Should I drop you home? - Bye.

355
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,298
Bro. Bro... Bro!

356
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,389
Yeah!

357
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:08,029
If staring worked, I'd be going
out with the whole girls' hostel!

358
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,425
What urgent work could have come up,
Gurpreet?!

359
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,097
You're behaving really weird these days!

360
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,268
Hurry up! I'm waiting!

361
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,072
Hello, Ms. Kavya!

362
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,106
The cold coffee in this
market is world famous!

363
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,509
You again!

364
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:23,669
I could leave!
You can wait for your friend alone!

365
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,278
It's bad manners to eavesdrop
on other people's conversations.

366
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:29,215
Can you lecture me
while drinking cold coffee?

367
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,011
Oh, fine. It'll be a good pass time.

368
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,023
World class, isn't it!

369
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,660
How would I know after one sip.

370
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:46,429
Are all girls in Ambala so feisty?

371
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,698
I'm not your guidebook,
go find out yourself!

372
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,574
What's your friend's full name,
by the way?

373
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,333
I've told you already.

374
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,539
Tell me again.

375
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,578
Gurpreet Sodhi.

376
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,373
That's right... Sodhi!

377
00:23:58,703 --> 00:23:59,613
Why do you ask?

378
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,673
I can't remember where
I've heard her name...

379
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,180
Don't get your hopes up...
she's getting married in 3 weeks.

380
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,416
By God... It's raining grooms.

381
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,220
How's your wedding shopping going?

382
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:14,356
Just alright... Still don't
have enough money for my wedding gown.

383
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,556
Didn't your parents give you any?

384
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,293
Dad said no...

385
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,326
He said it's too expensive.

386
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:20,764
How much?

387
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,195
I want a designer gown...

388
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,239
It costs Rs. 5 lakhs!

389
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,485
You've come here from Ambala
to buy a gown for Rs. 5 lakhs?!

390
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,645
Why is that funny?

391
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:41,252
Get me a shirt along with your gown...

392
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:42,551
For one thousand rupees!

393
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,058
Stop laughing-

394
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,529
So you're going to collect Rs.
5 lakhs in a month?

395
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,028
Yes, I am. - How?

396
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,564
I have a lot of great ideas!

397
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:50,758
Tell me one idea.

398
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,434
You won't be able to earn this money.

399
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,334
Why not?

400
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:57,373
Because you're not a con as you think,
you are naive!

401
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,577
Only 10,000 bucks for forging my marks?

402
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,409
Even Rs. 50,000 would have been less!

403
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,541
You're not a thief, Kavya!

404
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,606
Enjoy Delhi for a few days,
then go back to Ambala!

405
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,515
Get a local gown...
everyone will be happy!

406
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,621
I don't need your stupid advice!

407
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,390
Who are you to provide
commentary to the world?!

408
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:18,121
You can't even pass in
History without help! Idiot!

409
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,094
You should thank me and try to help...

410
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,563
...but instead,
you're sitting there spouting rubbish!

411
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,504
Oh, and I'm going to wear
a designer gown... no matter what!

412
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,063
Yeah... okay!

413
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,609
Why are you poking around in
her business? She's not your sister!

414
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:38,442
Shonty... She's our sister-in-law!

415
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,276
Bloody dung-for-brains...
Talk sense sometimes, man!

416
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,546
Awwvv! He's blushing!

417
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,023
I feel things when I see her, man...

418
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,692
Can't understand what
you feel without touching.

419
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,188
You don't have a girlfriend
because you're so vulgar.

420
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:58,132
Being classy won't help me, buddy...
I'm stuck with this face!

421
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,997
Stop this rubbish, guys...

422
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,229
Humpty, she's getting
married next month.

423
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:07,071
I know that already,
you don't have to keep reminding me...

424
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,305
I'm worried she'll do something foolish
trying to get this Rs. 5-lakh-gown!

425
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:13,279
Dude, the one to worry
about is her friend...

426
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:17,510
You're right, man...
I wish I could figure out who she is!

427
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,759
Shonty! You're like my brother, right?

428
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:30,164
Hello! Brother,
not Google, you scoundrel...

429
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,758
...getting you information
at a the touch of a button!

430
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,037
So you're not going to do it?!

431
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:36,629
No.

432
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,299
You won't help? - Don't disturb.

433
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,173
Just get the information, man!
Just get it, bro...

434
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,347
Okay! Okay! - First promise!

435
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:46,538
I promise!

436
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:56,091
Wow! Manish Malhotra‘s gowns!
It'll really suit you!

437
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,522
What?

438
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,567
I'm not going to apologise!

439
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,660
Just came to tell you
that your friend is Trouble.

440
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,029
I don't want to hear your rubbish!

441
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,574
It's not rubbish, it's the truth.

442
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,732
What is the truth? Tell me!

443
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,276
Your friend is lying to you.
Her gown is not designer.

444
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:21,582
And I saw her with a boy...
she's having an affair!

445
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,655
What? Kavya! Kavya!

446
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,146
Kavya, please believe me!

447
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,191
You're useless!

448
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,022
And I don't want to
listen to your nonsense!

449
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,028
Listen, I'm not useless!

450
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,027
I'm the sole heir to
my father's book empire!

451
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:38,130
Are you applying for the
post of most eligible Bachelor?

452
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,361
You're just brushing it off...
but you have to handle Gurpreet.

453
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,629
Why are you so obsessed with her?!

454
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,201
Does that make you jealous?!

455
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:46,535
I'm not jealous!

456
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,272
Listen to me...

457
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,743
We can clear this up in a minute.

458
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,443
Just come with me.

459
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,707
Come on!

460
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,385
This is Manish Ma
hotra‘s designer gown!

461
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,663
Exactly like the
one on your iPad, right?

462
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,120
How much is it for?

463
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,597
I want a fair discount...

464
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:13,168
Rs. 90,000, final price.

465
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,134
Huh?! How much did you say?!

466
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:18,169
The one on your iPad was around Rs.
5 lakhs, right?

467
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:19,506
What a discount!

468
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:22,170
Wait. This is a Manish
Malhotra original gown?

469
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,112
Oh, yes.
A hundred percent original fake.

470
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:30,248
Sir, did Gurpreet Sodhi
buy her wedding gown from here?

471
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,184
Yes, she did!

472
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,378
A")! problems?

473
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,685
Not at all, it's marvelous!

474
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,047
Tell me something...

475
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:38,286
how much would that gown be today?

476
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,253
The original costs about Rs. 3 lakhs...

477
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:43,296
We sold it to her for Rs. 70,000!

478
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,492
Packaged exactly like the showroom.

479
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,765
Your teeth will get dirty,
if you don't stop laughing!

480
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,474
Technically you should
be apologizing to me, now...

481
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,512
...but forget it,
I'm a very giving person.

482
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:00,047
Drop me to Gurpreet‘s house.

483
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:12,587
Talk to her...
call me if you need anything.

484
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:15,654
Thank you.

485
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,021
Welcome.

486
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,566
Bye. -Bye-.

487
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:23,139
I had ended the affair...

488
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,566
But, then he started blackmailing me.

489
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:29,638
I didn't even realize
he took a video of me!

490
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,539
Gurpreet, are you stupid?

491
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,417
I wanted to buy the designer gown...

492
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,416
But, he started demanding money.

493
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:41,122
So I got a fake,
inexpensive gown and gave him the money.

494
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,584
That's when he deleted the video.

495
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,728
Dad would have killed me,
if he found out!

496
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:03,234
Arts student, right?

497
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,143
Yes.

498
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,407
By the way... why is your name Humpty?

499
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,709
I used to be a really fat kid...

500
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,780
so, my friends
used to call me Humpty.

501
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:12,550
Since then, Rakesh became Humpty

502
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,682
Rakesh?! What a boring name...

503
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,287
He named me! 'Rakesh Sharma'!

504
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,197
Rakesh Sharma... The astronaut.

505
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,668
He was the first Indian
to land on the moon.

506
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,729
You're as pretty as the moon yourself.

507
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:36,104
Hello? Vidya Book Centre!

508
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,174
So, you're managing
your father's book ‘empire‘!

509
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:41,284
Yeah! So I'm not that
useless after all, right?

510
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,285
Oi! Don't be sarcastic!

511
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:44,578
Why is your cell phone off?

512
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,086
My battery is dead.

513
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,086
Can you meet me today? - Why?

514
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,522
That boy has blackmailed
and looted Gurpreet.

515
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,690
I can't believe you're still laughing!

516
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,097
Sorry!

517
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,203
What do you want to do?

518
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,668
We have to teach the scoundrel a lesson!

519
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,474
Get the money back... with interest!

520
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,168
Why are you doing this?!

521
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:09,301
It's over!

522
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,745
It's not over!

523
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:14,044
He got away...
He's going to do this to someone else!

524
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,179
Guys like this are scum!

525
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:19,545
They don't think about
the girl or her family!

526
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,386
Did something happen to you, as well?

527
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,426
I'd like to see someone
try to mess with me!

528
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,498
You're safe.

529
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,065
Come on.

530
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,101
Are you free tonight?

531
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,363
There's a birthday party...

532
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,097
Whose birthday? - Mine!

533
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,672
What?! But,
there's a different date on Facebook!

534
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,540
Yeah, that's wrong...

535
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,073
So you're following me on Facebook?

536
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,078
Like you haven't
checked my pictures out.

537
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,377
I have... You look like
a monkey in that white suit!

538
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,608
Better than a baboon
in a leather jacket!

539
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,179
So you'll come?

540
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:56,219
Well, why not...

541
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,222
There'll be alcohol, right?

542
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:00,395
You drink? - Yes...

543
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,987
You drink regularly?

544
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,230
Stop acting like a Mom!

545
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,401
My bottle will be over
before you've opened yours!

546
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,468
What should I get for you?

547
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,634
Leave it, Uncle!
We've got plans tonight...

548
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:18,011
It's your son's birthday...

549
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,375
How many birthdays
does he have in a year?

550
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,113
Hello, Dad. Dad, Kavya... Kavya, Dad.

551
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,448
Hello, Uncle. - Hello.

552
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:42,103
Brothers... We have gathered
to witness a great contest.

553
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:47,806
Kavya has wagered that she can finish
these two bottles of beer before me.

554
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,068
Stop the lecture... let's drink.

555
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,079
Poplu! Start the timer!

556
00:32:56,207 --> 00:33:01,486
s... 2... 1! Go!

557
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:25,441
Bro... She's like a Ferrari. Guzzle up!

558
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,525
WOW!

559
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,093
Don't worry, Humpty Dumpty!

560
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,729
Stick with me and you'll learn to drink!

561
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,259
I don't want to drink anymore...

562
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:46,202
What?! Music! Come on!

563
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,177
Kavya! - H u mpty!

564
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:41,551
You checked out my Facebook profile...
but you didn't send me a friend request.

565
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,322
Why should I? You send! What arrogance!

566
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:49,058
That sucks... if I send, I'm
desperate and if I don't I'm arrogant?

567
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,030
What's an innocent boy to do?

568
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:55,102
Innocent? You? My foot!

569
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,408
By the way... today's not my birthday.

570
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,274
I know. That's why
I didn't get you a present.

571
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,546
Don't worry.

572
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,513
I'll handle Gurpreet‘s problem...

573
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:18,425
and I'll get you your designer gown.

574
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,253
H u nlpty's promise.

575
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,729
Then you won't need
to sell your earrings.

576
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,633
I saw you the other day...

577
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:39,206
I see, too... you want to buy a car?

578
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,575
That's Dad's dream.

579
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,585
A few years ago, he even booked one.

580
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:50,020
Arranged the down payment,
loan, everything...

581
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,692
...But, there was a fire in the shop.

582
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,292
Rs. 20 lakh down the drain.

583
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:58,565
Never managed to save
enough after that...

584
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,501
God knows when we'll get the car.

585
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,336
Go to sleep, Poplu.

586
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,979
Why do Indian girls like NRl‘s so much?

587
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,049
Meaning?

588
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,052
Gurpreet‘s boy is from Singapore...

589
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,143
your‘s is from America.

590
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,120
The Indian ratio is getting ruined!

591
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:24,191
And, yeah...
Doesn't matter if our income is high...

592
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,656
...because our outcome
is always world class!

593
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,521
Yuck... I didn't choose the boy.

594
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,721
My dad chose him.

595
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:32,193
So you'll marry a stranger?

596
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,733
He's my dad's friend's son!

597
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:37,369
I've met him before...
We talk on Skype sometimes...

598
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,232
You're such a modern girl!

599
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,570
How could you agree
to an arranged marriage?

600
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:45,011
Modern girls don't
have arranged marriages?

601
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:48,616
They do. But they don't hang
out alone in Delhi a month before.

602
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,554
You know I've come to buy my gown...

603
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,485
I'm not as stupid as I look...

604
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,287
Wedding shopping happens
with the family...

605
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,458
We don't like to discuss
the wedding in front of my sister...

606
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,229
ls she single?

607
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,463
She's divorced.

608
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,102
Forget it. This is killing my buzz...

609
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,992
Sorry... In movies they
usually kiss at this moment...

610
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,224
Don't watch so many movies then!

611
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:45,670
Okay, it's not safe to go home so late,
so I'll leave in the morning...

612
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,404
Yeah...

613
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,707
What are you doing, man!

614
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:56,074
Bro... when girls leave you,
you need your friends!

615
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,630
You're even more
beautiful in the mornings.

616
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:58,643
I knew that last night would happen...

617
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:02,975
...that it would happen this way...
I had no idea...

618
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:06,679
What happened last night?

619
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:13,088
What happens between
a young man and young woman...

620
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,424
Oh... -Yes.

621
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:21,102
But you don't worry...
I'm here for you...

622
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,032
You psychopath!
What are you doing?! I was joking!

623
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,974
I know! I was drunk!
I didn't lose my memory!

624
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,514
Get rid of this romantic
movie hangover...

625
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,014
it'll get you in trouble!

626
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,018
Hurry up! That boy will be coming!

627
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,389
That's the scoundrel!

628
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:50,523
This is Bhanu?

629
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,627
He's the Principal's son...
City dwelling modern type.

630
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,639
Loves messing around with women.

631
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,074
Come on!

632
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,166
Let's go.

633
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:03,770
Mrs. Chibber!

634
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:05,439
You know her?!

635
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:08,743
I know everyone!
She's the Accounts' Professor's wife.

636
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:10,679
She looks like a decent person.

637
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,688
Decent?! She's a pervert!

638
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,422
She's ruined poor Chibber Sir's life.

639
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,125
Speaking from experience?

640
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:23,789
Chibber ma‘am...
early morning with Bhanu!

641
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,034
What are you doing?! Very bad!

642
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,225
Early morning cardio... very good!

643
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,627
Plan?

644
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,039
Let's go!

645
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,269
Name?

646
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,302
Poplesh Sahai.

647
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,244
You'll have to work in 12 hour shifts!

648
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:41,715
And salary for the first month is Rs.
2 and a half thousand!

649
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,410
You'll have Mondays off.

650
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:44,782
A")! Problem?

651
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,553
Not at all, sir!

652
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:51,318
Can I start today?

653
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,761
He always takes room 201.

654
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:05,233
I've kept the stuff ready.

655
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:08,035
Memorise your lines...
and don't over-act.

656
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,473
Oh... I was the best actor in my school.

657
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:11,569
I don't need your tips.

658
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,241
Swinging your pigtails
on stage isn't acting.

659
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:17,318
We have to fool Bhanu.

660
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,480
If he figures it out,
we'll all be screwed.

661
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,430
Wow.

662
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,439
What?

663
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:40,567
You look hot...

664
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,041
I was born hot!

665
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,203
Concentrate on the job!

666
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,040
Yeah...

667
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,189
Chibber...

668
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:06,457
Bhanu!

669
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:07,500
Chibber...

670
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:08,502
Bhanu!

671
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,469
Chibber!

672
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,301
Bhanuuu!

673
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,305
Stop it!

674
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,171
I'm showing you the exact position!

675
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:22,173
Chibber! I mean... Shonty!

676
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,080
Humpty! Bhanu‘s almost there!

677
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:25,119
Get out of there quickly!

678
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,117
Come on, Bhanu‘s coming!

679
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:45,399
You're new here?

680
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,108
Yes, sir...

681
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,544
Room 201.

682
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:04,015
Sir...

683
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:09,660
Are you here with someone... or alone?

684
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,568
Today I'm with someone...

685
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,731
I could come alone tomorrow?

686
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:23,171
I'm free from 4 am to 5 am...

687
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,638
Bhanu... Bhanu... Bhanu...

688
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,447
Chibber sir is so lucky, man...

689
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:05,551
Lucky how?!

690
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,280
Poor man, what a terrible wife...

691
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:11,522
Don't worry...

692
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,586
Chibber ma‘am is turning
over a new leaf tomorrow...

693
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:37,583
Bhanu... Bhanu...

694
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,054
You made this video?!

695
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,055
You've done this?! - What do you want?

696
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:43,113
I'll slap you!

697
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,056
Just shut up!

698
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:45,184
Tell me the truth!

699
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:46,319
If Mr. Chibber sees...

700
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:47,555
I don't care!

701
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,599
If my dad sees this he'll kill me!

702
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,065
What do you want from me?!

703
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,465
Get ready in ten minutes, I'm coming!

704
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,168
Where's that girl?

705
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:58,297
What girl?!

706
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,705
I'll break your face!

707
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,265
Where's the girl who was here yesterday!

708
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:04,073
We've never hired a girl here!

709
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:08,677
Get out of here!

710
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:44,509
Leave the money here and go.

711
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:52,060
Don't try to be sneaky or your
video will be leaked all over college.

712
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,197
This is my wedding jewelry... Give.

713
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,578
And listen. Never call me again.

714
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,271
Why would I?

715
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,438
You're like my son.

716
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,203
Poplu, look at this money!

717
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,334
What a perfect plan!

718
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:43,409
I'm going to get a tuxedo...
with a bovvtie!

719
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,740
You'll look like a waiter.

720
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,310
What, man...

721
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:47,642
Kavya keep it.

722
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:52,109
Aren't you happy?

723
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:54,344
These are Chibber
ma‘am‘s wedding jewels.

724
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,090
We can't take this.

725
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,147
Kavya, don't be emotional.

726
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,716
They'll fetch a lot of money!

727
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,289
You can buy your designer gown!

728
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:03,097
I don't want it this way.

729
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:10,996
Why do you look sad?

730
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:14,708
It doesn't suit you!

731
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:19,071
Just think how happy Gurpreet
will be with the money!

732
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,015
You've saved me.

733
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:26,416
Thank you so much!

734
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:28,054
Forget about it.

735
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:34,422
Thank you so much!

736
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:36,994
Forget it! Just stop hitting on me.

737
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:42,160
Why don't we get hugs... we also helped!

738
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:49,543
No... no... It's was a j-joke...

739
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:53,340
Here! A hug and a kiss!

740
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,055
What is this?

741
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:41,495
We don't want to look
at your sulky face anymore.

742
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,421
It's our contribution for Kavya‘s gown!

743
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:45,759
Keep it.

744
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:47,195
Where did you get this money?

745
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:50,396
We had set it aside for your dowry...

746
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,767
It's not like anyone
will want to marry you...

747
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,072
we'd have to get a dowry bride!

748
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,568
I need 2 and a half lakhs more.

749
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,543
Okay. Keep this.

750
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,177
I'd saved it for the
down payment of the car.

751
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,345
You can use it.

752
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,446
You said we hadn't saved anything.

753
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,557
It's called a secret stash...

754
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,250
For use in emergencies.

755
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,952
Don't talk rubbish, I'm not taking it.

756
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,395
We can get a car after
a couple of years...

757
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,093
Kavya‘s wedding is now, right?

758
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:23,201
Besides, how is a car
going to change anything?

759
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,737
You'll drive, me besides
you and these two at the back!

760
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,472
You've only met her once!

761
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,135
Don't act so righteous!

762
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,609
I'm your father, not a fool.

763
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:35,244
It's an advance... from your salary!

764
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,750
So you'll have to work for
free for the next three years!

765
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,282
It's okay... I'll buy your beer.

766
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:45,057
Chilled! Relax!

767
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,022
Relax! Aww! So sweet, man!

768
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:53,294
What are you doing?!

769
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:10,649
Why do you want an empty bag?

770
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,062
Where did you get the money?

771
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,465
From the bank. Robbed it at gunpoint.

772
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,635
Humpty... be honest.

773
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,039
I didn't do anything wrong to get it...

774
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,071
I promised you a designer gown...

775
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:37,511
I don't break my promises.

776
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,141
I can't take it.

777
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,043
Think of it as a loan.

778
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:48,388
Return it to me in
dollars after the wedding.

779
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:55,595
Scoundrel...

780
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,057
you managed it after all.

781
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:01,436
You shrew...
If you had picked a gown for 10 lakhs...

782
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,367
I'd have got that for you, too.

783
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,047
What?

784
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,307
Nothing.

785
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:20,018
I should leave...

786
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,288
Thank you.

787
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:30,120
Don't get emotional.

788
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,304
“This Punjabi firecracker“

789
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,997
“She's a total fashionista“

790
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:14,440
"I've been seeing her around everyday"

791
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:16,272
“She's a black magic woman“

792
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,074
“And she wants a piece of my heart“

793
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:21,681
“And I've been noticing her around“

794
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:25,418
“Who knows who he's dreaming of?“

795
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,350
“Let him do his thing...“

796
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,219
“What's it to me?“

797
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:30,349
“Oh yeah...“

798
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,023
“Oh yeah...“

799
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:34,458
“D's for Dance“ “Give it a chance“

800
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,555
“Let's go crazy tonight!“

801
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,266
“D's for Dance“ “Give it a chance“

802
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,565
“Let's go crazy tonight!“

803
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:48,434
“D's for Dance“ “Give it a chance“

804
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:51,103
“Let's go crazy tonight!“

805
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,594
“Don't get your hopes up, boy...“

806
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:12,029
“Why do you get your hopes up?“

807
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:15,659
“Look how she tricks me and fools me...“

808
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:19,437
“There's a new wicked girl
around these parts suddenly...“

809
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:27,037
“Dressed up to the nines,
looking hotter than the bride.“

810
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:30,344
"Smells like someone's burning up"

811
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,115
“Who cares how dressed up I am?“

812
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:35,121
“Oh yeah...“

813
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:37,082
“Oh yeah...“

814
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,054
“D's for Dance“ “Give it a chance“

815
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:41,458
“Let's go crazy tonight!“

816
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,297
“D's for Dance“ “Give it a chance“

817
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,426
“Let's go crazy tonight!“

818
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:07,382
“Take my heart, my very soul...“

819
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:11,686
“Take my heart, my very soul!“

820
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:15,458
“Didn't your teachers
teach you anything?“

821
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:19,091
"I'd give you detention everyday!"

822
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:22,533
“Look at this boy's face...“

823
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:26,303
“Bitter like a gourd!“

824
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:28,240
"I'm a little bitter and a little sweet"

825
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:30,209
“For whatever suits your taste!“

826
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:31,778
"I want to love you openly,"

827
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,547
“What is there to hide?“

828
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,741
“Oh yeah...“

829
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,473
“Oh yeah...“

830
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,583
“D's for Dance“ “Give it a chance“

831
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:40,177
“Let's go crazy tonight!“

832
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,060
“D's for Dance“ “Give it a chance“

833
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,027
“Let's go crazy tonight!“

834
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,130
“D's for Dance“ “Give it a chance“

835
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,361
“Let's go crazy tonight!“

836
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,372
“D's for Dance“ “Give it a chance“

837
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,637
“Let's go crazy tonight!“

838
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,375
“D's for Dance“ “Give it a chance“

839
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:10,111
“Let's go crazy tonight!“

840
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,165
When are you going back to Ambala?

841
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,462
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

842
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,567
After Gurpreet‘s wedding ceremony.

843
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:33,173
Stay back a few days...

844
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:34,640
Dad's calling me back...

845
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,640
The wedding preparations are starting.

846
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:43,406
So this is the last time I'll see you.

847
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,278
Why?

848
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,486
Aren't you coming tomorrow?

849
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:52,056
You helped me... helped Gurpreet...

850
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:53,218
I can't come.

851
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,426
Now what?

852
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,627
Now shut your eyes and sleep.

853
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:40,670
Do you love me?

854
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:51,648
My sister loved a boy once...

855
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,614
Dad didn't like him.

856
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:04,089
But she married him, anyway.

857
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:11,005
The boy turned out to be a dog.

858
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:15,203
He began beating my sister.

859
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,107
She came back home...

860
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:24,075
but my dad has never forgiven her.

861
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,161
<i>He's opened a cyber cafe for her...</i>

862
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:37,126
but he's always taunting her.

863
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:40,131
My father doesn't believe in love.

864
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:44,433
Angad is his choice.

865
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:53,306
I can't break his heart.

866
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,551
How much you talk.

867
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:07,392
Such a long answer for
such a simple question...

868
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:17,466
Do you love me?

869
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,210
I can't sleep...

870
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:34,248
Wanna hear a poem?

871
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:35,617
In English?

872
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,158
Will that make me sleepy?

873
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:39,725
Guaranteed!

874
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,357
okay»-

875
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:51,603
“Tomorrow you will go...

876
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:56,668
My life will again become slow...

877
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:02,379
In wedding finery,
your face will glow...

878
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:08,582
Like Shakespeare, my beard will grow...“

879
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:13,990
Kavya?

880
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:18,525
Kavya?

881
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,726
Give him this for now,

882
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:55,668
we'll settle the rest later...

883
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:59,036
Dad! We're going to
need a split airconditioner.

884
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,199
Okay, so get it.

885
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:02,442
I don't want any problems with cooling.

886
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:06,046
Don't worry, sir! You have my word!

887
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:07,780
Think before you speak.

888
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:11,218
My to-be-son-in-law is coming.

889
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:17,090
If he's even slightly uncomfortable,
I'll shut down your dealership.

890
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:26,432
Granny... Kavya‘s looking
grown up after her Delhi trip.

891
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:29,594
No... I'm just tanned from the sun.

892
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:35,372
I can't believe she's
back without her designer gown.

893
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,209
I'm very upset!

894
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:38,311
Why, Granny?

895
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,243
Try and understand...

896
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:45,648
She can't show off your designer
gown to Angad‘s granny now!

897
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:48,245
I looked everywhere!
Nothing really suited me...

898
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:52,688
These designer gowns
suit girls from the city...

899
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,322
for you... local tailor! Best!

900
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:00,397
You didn't leave anything behind,
did you?

901
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:04,469
What's left behind is gone now.

902
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:06,335
I have to prepare myself for America.

903
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:12,476
Single Line Registers...
50 hard covers, 50 soft covers.

904
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:15,209
50 long notebooks, 50 small notebooks.

905
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:18,315
No, only 25 small notebooks...
they sell slowly.

906
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:19,475
People will keep buying them!

907
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:20,646
Nobody buys anything...

908
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:22,256
They'll just become trash!

909
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:24,690
Can you'll be quiet?!

910
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,784
Humpty‘s very serious about work,
these days!

911
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,357
Ever since I've joined,
you've become lazy.

912
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,396
Your days of frolicking are over...
now, mine have begun! Point!

913
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:38,537
Excuse me? Mr. Humpty Sharma?

914
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:39,571
Yeah, that's me.

915
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,334
Sir, congratulations on your new car!

916
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:46,173
The new Celerio... with Drive
EZ Technology... Just this, that's it!

917
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:47,774
Drive easy.

918
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:49,576
Dad, did you...

919
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:50,640
BIC)! I did I1"I:!

920
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,180
I haven't bought a car, sir.

921
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:56,321
I know, sir. This is a gift for you.

922
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,153
From Kavya Pratap Singh.

923
01:04:14,749 --> 01:04:15,557
Did you watch the match?

924
01:04:15,616 --> 01:04:16,686
Which match?

925
01:04:16,751 --> 01:04:18,389
Bangladesh vs. Kenya?

926
01:04:18,553 --> 01:04:20,533
Who would watch that...

927
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,674
Do you like the surprise?

928
01:04:36,637 --> 01:04:38,241
Are you crazy?!

929
01:04:38,472 --> 01:04:40,110
Stop trying to be heroic!

930
01:04:40,341 --> 01:04:41,684
Aren't you happy to see me?

931
01:04:42,543 --> 01:04:43,613
I'm very haPPY-

932
01:04:43,678 --> 01:04:44,782
But, if my brother sees-

933
01:04:44,845 --> 01:04:46,290
He'll kill me?

934
01:04:46,347 --> 01:04:47,519
You relax.

935
01:04:47,648 --> 01:04:49,559
Your wedding will be on time.

936
01:04:50,785 --> 01:04:52,458
Everyone's under your spell...

937
01:04:52,787 --> 01:04:54,767
You bought us a new car!

938
01:04:55,423 --> 01:04:56,766
My dad says it's wonderful...

939
01:04:56,824 --> 01:04:58,394
the car...

940
01:04:58,459 --> 01:04:59,631
and you.

941
01:05:01,562 --> 01:05:03,803
Humpty... please... leave.

942
01:05:06,667 --> 01:05:08,806
I had to get you something
in return for your gift...

943
01:05:10,171 --> 01:05:11,115
Humpty... you...

944
01:05:11,172 --> 01:05:12,276
Oh, don't get sentimental.

945
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:17,211
Tell me, are you happy to see me?

946
01:05:22,817 --> 01:05:23,818
Very haPPy-

947
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,261
Let's go talk to your father.

948
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:30,234
Are you insane?

949
01:05:30,291 --> 01:05:31,361
I'm getting married!

950
01:05:31,425 --> 01:05:32,631
My father will kill you!

951
01:05:32,693 --> 01:05:35,071
Sooner or later we'll
have to tell them how we feel!

952
01:05:35,129 --> 01:05:37,234
You can take your
feelings and get lost!

953
01:05:37,265 --> 01:05:37,709
Kavya...

954
01:05:37,765 --> 01:05:39,369
If I see you again,
I'll shoot you myself!

955
01:05:39,433 --> 01:05:40,411
Kavyag

956
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,475
She didn't even say hi.

957
01:05:47,541 --> 01:05:48,849
Thank God she didn't!

958
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:50,621
I don't want to die here.

959
01:05:50,845 --> 01:05:52,791
Oye! What now?

960
01:05:56,284 --> 01:05:58,821
I've come from Delhi
with Kavya‘s wedding gown.

961
01:06:11,432 --> 01:06:12,433
Come, dear!

962
01:06:12,667 --> 01:06:15,807
Rakesh was just telling us
how he came to be called Humpty!

963
01:06:16,237 --> 01:06:19,184
Since, when did designers
start having Lucky Draw Raffles?

964
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:19,877
What?

965
01:06:20,141 --> 01:06:24,112
I was just telling them how
there was a Raffle in our store...

966
01:06:24,145 --> 01:06:25,681
for to-be brides.

967
01:06:26,047 --> 01:06:27,151
You won, ma‘am!

968
01:06:27,214 --> 01:06:30,252
Wow! Kavya, what luck!

969
01:06:31,152 --> 01:06:32,563
Amongst how many did she win?

970
01:06:32,787 --> 01:06:34,596
Sir, 150 people!

971
01:06:36,691 --> 01:06:38,193
It's a good story.

972
01:06:38,459 --> 01:06:42,373
Son, this glass from
which you're drinking...

973
01:06:43,531 --> 01:06:44,532
this mansion...

974
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,111
in which you stand...

975
01:06:47,501 --> 01:06:49,708
it's a result of very hard work.

976
01:06:50,471 --> 01:06:51,848
I've earned a lot of respect.

977
01:06:52,373 --> 01:06:58,380
I'm not as gullible
as you think I am...

978
01:06:59,447 --> 01:07:00,585
Put the glass down.

979
01:07:10,224 --> 01:07:11,259
Tell me the truth.

980
01:07:17,231 --> 01:07:18,710
Sir, my name is Humpty Sharma.

981
01:07:19,233 --> 01:07:22,305
I met Kavya by accident
at her uncle's house.

982
01:07:23,404 --> 01:07:25,042
When I researched...

983
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:29,610
When I asked around about her,
I found out she's betrothed.

984
01:07:31,712 --> 01:07:33,123
But, I wasn't convinced.

985
01:07:34,248 --> 01:07:37,229
I kept finding excuses to meet her.

986
01:07:38,052 --> 01:07:39,656
I thought we could
be friends at least...

987
01:07:40,121 --> 01:07:43,261
And when she has to leave,
I'll control my feelings.

988
01:07:46,627 --> 01:07:48,072
But, then love struck, sir...

989
01:07:49,797 --> 01:07:50,775
To me...

990
01:07:53,134 --> 01:07:54,078
and to Kavya.

991
01:07:56,637 --> 01:07:58,082
So, I came to talk to you.

992
01:07:58,139 --> 01:07:59,311
What the hell will you talk about?!

993
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,849
If you wanted to talk, you wouldn't
have wasted time with this drama.

994
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:05,522
Sir, it's not like that,
I really did come to talk.

995
01:08:05,713 --> 01:08:06,817
Ranjit, take him away.

996
01:08:07,481 --> 01:08:08,323
Come on!

997
01:08:08,382 --> 01:08:09,417
Dad!

998
01:08:09,717 --> 01:08:10,695
Come on, you scoundrel!

999
01:08:15,356 --> 01:08:16,596
Please listen to me.

1000
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:27,740
Enough Ranjit.

1001
01:08:43,417 --> 01:08:45,397
Take them back to Delhi.

1002
01:08:48,622 --> 01:08:50,693
I told him not to come, Mom...

1003
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:53,661
I don't know why he's here.

1004
01:08:54,762 --> 01:08:56,298
He's mad.

1005
01:08:57,631 --> 01:09:00,168
I'm scared of what my husband will do.

1006
01:09:00,401 --> 01:09:02,244
I know my son.

1007
01:09:02,336 --> 01:09:03,713
He won't do a thing.

1008
01:09:04,138 --> 01:09:05,481
Do you love him?

1009
01:09:05,806 --> 01:09:06,648
Yes.

1010
01:09:06,707 --> 01:09:07,777
You can just forget
about it right now!

1011
01:09:07,842 --> 01:09:11,119
I would have killed him,
if Dad hadn't stopped me.

1012
01:09:14,415 --> 01:09:17,294
Forget what happened
in Delhi and today.

1013
01:09:18,686 --> 01:09:20,563
Angad is coming in two days.

1014
01:09:21,288 --> 01:09:24,098
I don't want any trouble
till the wedding.

1015
01:09:45,312 --> 01:09:46,382
Why are you laughing?

1016
01:09:47,548 --> 01:09:50,051
I'm laughing from the pain!

1017
01:09:56,724 --> 01:09:58,795
Shonty, why aren't you laughing?

1018
01:10:00,528 --> 01:10:03,737
My backside is wrecked.

1019
01:10:05,499 --> 01:10:08,639
The truck driver went
into every damn pothole, man!

1020
01:10:08,836 --> 01:10:13,182
Your father-in-law
is a great guy, Humpty!

1021
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:16,084
At least he gave us a lift to Delhi!

1022
01:10:17,278 --> 01:10:18,780
Wish he'd given us some food too...

1023
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,384
I'm so hungry, man!

1024
01:10:22,082 --> 01:10:24,494
I can smell the tandoori chicken...

1025
01:10:25,352 --> 01:10:27,093
Oh, HumPty!

1026
01:10:27,721 --> 01:10:29,792
Let's be serious for a minute...

1027
01:10:30,324 --> 01:10:32,065
okay»-

1028
01:10:32,126 --> 01:10:35,630
Forget her now, man...

1029
01:10:35,696 --> 01:10:39,542
If I hadn't gone to Ambala,
I'd have forgotten her, man...

1030
01:10:40,234 --> 01:10:42,646
But, when I saw
her in the gurudwara...

1031
01:10:43,537 --> 01:10:44,572
I fell in love again!

1032
01:10:45,506 --> 01:10:48,112
It's still never
happened for me and...

1033
01:10:48,175 --> 01:10:49,745
this guy has fallen
for the same girl twice!

1034
01:10:58,185 --> 01:10:59,255
Hello?

1035
01:11:08,395 --> 01:11:09,339
Ya, Swati?

1036
01:11:09,396 --> 01:11:11,205
Kavya, H u nlpty's back.

1037
01:11:11,432 --> 01:11:12,502
Come outside, quickly!

1038
01:11:27,147 --> 01:11:31,596
“Don't want to live without you...“

1039
01:11:31,652 --> 01:11:36,123
“Don't want to live without you...“

1040
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:40,536
“Don't want to live without you...“

1041
01:11:40,594 --> 01:11:45,168
“Don't want to live without you...“

1042
01:11:47,334 --> 01:11:51,646
“How do I explain to you?“

1043
01:11:51,805 --> 01:11:56,220
“How my heart is
anxious without you...“

1044
01:11:56,377 --> 01:12:00,416
“How do I explain to you?“

1045
01:12:00,748 --> 01:12:05,356
“How my heart is
anxious without you...“

1046
01:12:05,419 --> 01:12:09,765
"What do you know of my love?"

1047
01:12:09,823 --> 01:12:14,397
“Or of how I wait for you...“

1048
01:12:14,428 --> 01:12:18,672
“You are my heart, my very life“

1049
01:12:18,732 --> 01:12:23,238
“How do I explain to you?“

1050
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:27,446
“How my heart is
anxious without you...“

1051
01:12:27,741 --> 01:12:32,315
"What do you know of my love?"

1052
01:12:32,379 --> 01:12:36,725
“Or of how I wait for you...“

1053
01:12:36,784 --> 01:12:41,255
“You are my heart, my very being“

1054
01:12:41,321 --> 01:12:45,599
“How do I explain to you?“

1055
01:12:45,793 --> 01:12:50,264
“How my heart is
anxious without you...“

1056
01:13:12,386 --> 01:13:20,703
"Our hearts' paths are one"

1057
01:13:21,361 --> 01:13:28,836
“When you walk with me,
the rains walk with us...“

1058
01:13:29,103 --> 01:13:33,483
"My life... oh---"

1059
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:37,386
"ls now yours, how can I help that?"

1060
01:13:37,411 --> 01:13:41,860
“Have faith in me...“

1061
01:13:42,116 --> 01:13:46,394
"I will wait for you"

1062
01:13:46,453 --> 01:13:50,765
“You are my heart, my very life“

1063
01:13:50,824 --> 01:13:55,398
“How do I explain to you?“

1064
01:13:55,462 --> 01:14:00,104
“How my heart is
anxious without you...“

1065
01:14:17,384 --> 01:14:19,125
I know something about you, sir...

1066
01:14:19,186 --> 01:14:20,187
Really.

1067
01:14:20,621 --> 01:14:23,397
You definitely had a love marriage.

1068
01:14:26,126 --> 01:14:27,434
So, you met Kavya.

1069
01:14:27,628 --> 01:14:29,505
Yes... but she didn't tell me, sir.

1070
01:14:29,563 --> 01:14:31,406
You and your wife aren't
from the same caste...

1071
01:14:31,465 --> 01:14:33,240
I figured it out, myself.

1072
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,081
If you're so smart...

1073
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:44,756
why have to come
back to die in Ambala?

1074
01:14:45,479 --> 01:14:47,516
How long can one run from death, sir?

1075
01:14:51,451 --> 01:14:53,260
So, you're not opposed to love, sir!

1076
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,697
A few incidents have soured...

1077
01:14:54,755 --> 01:14:56,166
Shut up!

1078
01:15:01,695 --> 01:15:03,265
Don't you dare talk about Swati.

1079
01:15:08,502 --> 01:15:10,539
This is my final warning.

1080
01:15:11,839 --> 01:15:15,377
If I see you in Ambala again...

1081
01:15:15,642 --> 01:15:18,714
only your corpse
will return to Delhi.

1082
01:15:29,556 --> 01:15:31,365
Dad, Humpty‘s a very nice boy.

1083
01:15:31,525 --> 01:15:32,629
Just give him a chance!

1084
01:15:32,693 --> 01:15:33,671
Shut up, Kavya!

1085
01:15:33,727 --> 01:15:34,671
Why?

1086
01:15:34,828 --> 01:15:36,364
Are you going to hit me as well?

1087
01:15:38,699 --> 01:15:40,235
He's come here for me!

1088
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,640
He loves me!

1089
01:15:41,802 --> 01:15:43,281
He shouldn't love you.

1090
01:15:44,605 --> 01:15:46,141
He knows you're betrothed to someone.

1091
01:15:46,306 --> 01:15:47,307
So what?!

1092
01:15:47,474 --> 01:15:48,544
I fell in love with him too, didn't I?

1093
01:15:48,609 --> 01:15:49,451
Then get over it.

1094
01:15:49,509 --> 01:15:50,385
I can't get over it!

1095
01:15:50,444 --> 01:15:51,718
Too bad, keep crying then!

1096
01:15:52,646 --> 01:15:55,252
You will only marry Angad!

1097
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:58,527
Why are you ruining my life?

1098
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:10,264
A father's life is ruined,
when a daughter's marriage breaks.

1099
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:12,367
Dad, you can't shut everyone
up by bringing up...

1100
01:16:12,432 --> 01:16:14,639
Swati in every situation!

1101
01:16:14,868 --> 01:16:17,678
What if Angad is
a scoundrel like Param?

1102
01:16:19,673 --> 01:16:21,482
Humpty‘s a good person, Dad!

1103
01:16:21,508 --> 01:16:24,785
He came back for me,
despite being beaten so badly!

1104
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,721
Please, Dad! At least meet him!

1105
01:16:28,815 --> 01:16:31,694
Please, Dad, please!

1106
01:16:32,152 --> 01:16:34,826
For me! Just once! For me!

1107
01:16:37,357 --> 01:16:38,461
Please.

1108
01:16:41,261 --> 01:16:42,262
Okay.

1109
01:16:43,664 --> 01:16:44,608
Call him here.

1110
01:17:00,681 --> 01:17:01,751
Pick up that glass.

1111
01:17:04,418 --> 01:17:05,488
I said, pick up the glass!

1112
01:17:11,325 --> 01:17:13,601
Kavya is going to marry Angad.

1113
01:17:14,561 --> 01:17:17,804
And I don't want her to think that...

1114
01:17:17,864 --> 01:17:21,812
her father didn't
give her love a chance.

1115
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,386
Tomorrow onwards,
you're on Angad duty.

1116
01:17:36,149 --> 01:17:38,186
For the next 5 days...

1117
01:17:40,053 --> 01:17:43,500
you can find out
anything you like about him.

1118
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:52,711
Find one reason why
Angad is wrong for Kavya.

1119
01:17:54,234 --> 01:17:56,180
Just one.

1120
01:18:03,543 --> 01:18:06,490
I'll let Kavya marry you.

1121
01:18:08,815 --> 01:18:12,729
To hell with what people will think.

1122
01:18:15,522 --> 01:18:16,728
Remember.

1123
01:18:20,127 --> 01:18:21,731
I'm trusting you.

1124
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:24,268
Don't break my trust.

1125
01:18:26,266 --> 01:18:28,303
You love Kavya, don't you?

1126
01:18:29,736 --> 01:18:35,482
Now, her future is in your hands.

1127
01:18:36,743 --> 01:18:40,350
However, if you can't find a reason...

1128
01:18:43,517 --> 01:18:46,657
I want you gone on the 6th day.

1129
01:19:06,206 --> 01:19:10,382
What kind of cot is this!

1130
01:19:10,744 --> 01:19:13,247
Such injustice! Do something, man!

1131
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:15,491
Got inside your house, didn't I?

1132
01:19:16,316 --> 01:19:17,294
You're a loser!

1133
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:18,795
You're destined to be with this loser.

1134
01:19:19,252 --> 01:19:20,390
Don't be cheeky.

1135
01:19:20,854 --> 01:19:24,563
We're in the same house now
and you're babbling away on the phone.

1136
01:19:24,691 --> 01:19:25,635
What do you want?!

1137
01:19:25,692 --> 01:19:28,298
I don't think you actually
dare to come and see me in person!

1138
01:19:28,428 --> 01:19:29,338
Oh, really?

1139
01:19:37,304 --> 01:19:39,284
Now that I'm here,
I won't leave empty-handed...

1140
01:19:39,673 --> 01:19:40,811
You haven't said it yet.

1141
01:19:41,074 --> 01:19:41,814
Said what?

1142
01:19:42,075 --> 01:19:42,678
That.

1143
01:19:42,742 --> 01:19:43,720
What's that?

1144
01:19:46,146 --> 01:19:48,092
Oh. Thaaat!

1145
01:19:48,148 --> 01:19:49,149
Say it, quickly.

1146
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:52,257
Didn't you hear me
announcing it your father?

1147
01:19:52,519 --> 01:19:53,429
Say it to me.

1148
01:19:53,487 --> 01:19:55,091
I don't care who
else you've said it to.

1149
01:19:55,155 --> 01:19:57,692
When Shahrukh Khan spreads his arms
and says it, he looks like a hero.

1150
01:19:57,757 --> 01:19:59,202
I'll look like a fool.

1151
01:19:59,392 --> 01:20:00,666
I don't care, say it!

1152
01:20:00,727 --> 01:20:01,705
You say it, first!

1153
01:20:01,761 --> 01:20:03,240
Say it, or I'll scream!

1154
01:20:10,370 --> 01:20:11,474
I love you.

1155
01:20:14,641 --> 01:20:15,449
I know.

1156
01:20:15,509 --> 01:20:16,453
Now you say it!

1157
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:17,215
Not in the mood!

1158
01:20:41,468 --> 01:20:42,776
This... this is Angad?

1159
01:20:43,036 --> 01:20:44,379
Bro, you've won!

1160
01:20:44,437 --> 01:20:45,814
Kavya is yours!

1161
01:20:46,072 --> 01:20:46,743
Congratulations!

1162
01:20:49,376 --> 01:20:51,652
Uhh... Humpty Sharma?

1163
01:21:09,729 --> 01:21:14,769
Dude... is this guy
a doctor or a model?!

1164
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:24,614
This is great, huh?

1165
01:21:25,579 --> 01:21:28,219
First they hit us, then they party.

1166
01:21:51,538 --> 01:21:53,484
Have a drink!

1167
01:21:53,506 --> 01:21:54,246
No, I don't drink...

1168
01:21:54,541 --> 01:21:55,815
It's a large shot!

1169
01:22:01,748 --> 01:22:03,750
This is why I have told
you to curb your drinking.

1170
01:22:05,485 --> 01:22:08,762
I don't drink too much,
I just get high fast!

1171
01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:11,462
ls everything alright?

1172
01:22:11,825 --> 01:22:13,065
I'm a doctor.

1173
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:14,261
Ya...

1174
01:22:14,628 --> 01:22:16,505
Angad. - I'm Humpty.

1175
01:22:17,297 --> 01:22:18,207
<i>This is Shanty.</i>

1176
01:22:19,232 --> 01:22:20,210
Interesting names.

1177
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:23,648
Mine's the most interesting... Poplu!

1178
01:22:32,379 --> 01:22:33,551
You... don't drink?

1179
01:22:35,115 --> 01:22:35,752
No.

1180
01:22:36,182 --> 01:22:38,287
Tried it in college.
But it's not for me.

1181
01:22:38,585 --> 01:22:40,496
You should have a drink sometimes...

1182
01:22:40,553 --> 01:22:42,123
It helps you relax.

1183
01:22:42,188 --> 01:22:43,098
I don't think so.

1184
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:47,436
A drunken man thinks with his heart,
not his mind.

1185
01:22:47,627 --> 01:22:49,129
Well, we're Punjabi.

1186
01:22:49,195 --> 01:22:51,266
No mind, all heart.

1187
01:22:51,331 --> 01:22:52,537
I'm Punjabi, too.

1188
01:22:52,732 --> 01:22:54,109
But, the intellectual kind.

1189
01:22:54,334 --> 01:22:55,335
I like to be in control.

1190
01:22:58,838 --> 01:23:02,615
If he wasn't engaged to Kavya,
I'd marry him.

1191
01:23:12,652 --> 01:23:13,653
Hi, you beast.

1192
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,858
Don't.

1193
01:23:15,121 --> 01:23:16,657
I'm high!
Don't you want to take advantage?

1194
01:23:16,723 --> 01:23:17,497
No.

1195
01:23:18,725 --> 01:23:20,602
Why didn't you tell
me Angad was such a stud?

1196
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:22,862
Everyone looks like a stud on Skype.

1197
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:26,371
Aww, you're jealous!

1198
01:23:26,433 --> 01:23:28,538
I was jealous when
I saw him in the morning.

1199
01:23:28,601 --> 01:23:30,274
Now I'm scared out of my wits!

1200
01:23:32,205 --> 01:23:33,183
Stop laughing!

1201
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:34,343
And that brother of yours... - Aye!

1202
01:23:34,607 --> 01:23:36,177
What? - Don't say a word about him.

1203
01:23:36,242 --> 01:23:38,415
You remember how he beat me?

1204
01:23:38,478 --> 01:23:41,288
And now he's giggling
like a heroine with Angad.

1205
01:23:43,383 --> 01:23:45,124
Stop wasting time, Rakesh.

1206
01:23:46,753 --> 01:23:48,130
Give me a sexy smile.

1207
01:24:18,351 --> 01:24:19,853
Looks like it's been years
since you pulled one, Sir.

1208
01:24:23,656 --> 01:24:25,363
I want to say something,
if you don't mind.

1209
01:24:25,558 --> 01:24:27,504
He's way older than Kavya.

1210
01:24:27,694 --> 01:24:29,298
By 5 or 6 years, at least!

1211
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:31,436
It's not a good match.

1212
01:24:32,365 --> 01:24:34,470
My wife is 5 years younger than me.

1213
01:24:35,668 --> 01:24:37,409
Everything matches, eventually.

1214
01:24:42,542 --> 01:24:43,714
Dad's called you to go jogging.

1215
01:24:43,777 --> 01:24:45,518
Falling for you was a big mistake.

1216
01:24:45,812 --> 01:24:47,120
He's called Angad, as well.

1217
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,454
To be a towel holder.

1218
01:24:48,515 --> 01:24:49,459
Have you ever jogged in your life?

1219
01:24:50,116 --> 01:24:52,357
I was a champion athlete
in school and college!

1220
01:24:52,752 --> 01:24:53,560
Liar.

1221
01:24:54,154 --> 01:24:56,225
I look like Milkha Singh when I run!

1222
01:25:00,326 --> 01:25:01,202
Hi, Uncle!

1223
01:25:03,496 --> 01:25:04,474
Are you having fun, son?

1224
01:25:04,497 --> 01:25:05,475
Yes, Uncle!

1225
01:25:05,498 --> 01:25:06,442
One more lap.

1226
01:25:12,305 --> 01:25:13,249
Good Morning.

1227
01:25:13,473 --> 01:25:16,181
I was afraid you'd
run away with Kavya...

1228
01:25:17,410 --> 01:25:19,151
but, it doesn't look
like you'll get very far.

1229
01:25:19,479 --> 01:25:23,393
Look at him; a real, macho Punjabi!

1230
01:25:23,716 --> 01:25:25,525
Come on, Humpty! - Ya...

1231
01:25:45,638 --> 01:25:47,379
H u mpty! Don't eat!

1232
01:25:48,374 --> 01:25:50,820
I'm making spaghetti ravioli
and risotto with garlic bread!

1233
01:25:51,211 --> 01:25:52,690
I want everyone to enjoy it.

1234
01:25:52,745 --> 01:25:53,655
Yeah... yeah...

1235
01:25:53,713 --> 01:25:55,090
Make sure you don't eat anything.

1236
01:25:55,248 --> 01:25:56,522
Definitely.

1237
01:25:58,318 --> 01:25:59,194
Granny!

1238
01:25:59,619 --> 01:26:01,394
Granny! What rubbish is he making?!

1239
01:26:01,454 --> 01:26:02,831
You will all get indigestion!

1240
01:26:03,223 --> 01:26:04,725
He's making Italian food!

1241
01:26:05,191 --> 01:26:07,296
Let the Italians eat Italian food!

1242
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:09,633
We're Indians!
We want Indian food, right?!

1243
01:26:09,696 --> 01:26:12,643
Oh, Humpty.
These men from abroad are the best.

1244
01:26:12,799 --> 01:26:15,780
They cook, they clean...
What do you say?

1245
01:26:16,302 --> 01:26:19,511
Of course! Indian men are useless!

1246
01:26:19,772 --> 01:26:21,843
Sitting with their feet up,
with the newspaper...

1247
01:26:22,108 --> 01:26:23,348
Get me tea, get me food!

1248
01:26:23,376 --> 01:26:24,787
That's all!

1249
01:26:25,478 --> 01:26:27,389
All Indian men are
not like that, Granny.

1250
01:26:27,413 --> 01:26:30,553
All the men we've seen are like that.

1251
01:27:10,189 --> 01:27:11,497
Do you like my sweater, sir?

1252
01:27:11,624 --> 01:27:13,797
Exactly like yours, right?

1253
01:27:15,795 --> 01:27:17,103
Nice.

1254
01:27:23,703 --> 01:27:25,444
How did you like Angad‘s cooking?

1255
01:27:26,205 --> 01:27:27,047
Yeah... very nice.

1256
01:28:06,245 --> 01:28:07,189
Humpty!

1257
01:28:08,081 --> 01:28:09,219
Move!

1258
01:28:11,651 --> 01:28:13,358
Leave me!

1259
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:18,667
You call this a salad?

1260
01:28:18,725 --> 01:28:20,466
It's a Delhi speciality!

1261
01:28:22,095 --> 01:28:23,233
Look at this, Humpty!

1262
01:28:23,830 --> 01:28:26,037
Look at this, Humpty! - Look at what?

1263
01:28:35,541 --> 01:28:36,645
Stop laughing!

1264
01:28:37,210 --> 01:28:39,212
<i>Dye). Singh sir is asking for you.</i>

1265
01:28:47,553 --> 01:28:48,691
Where are we going, sir?!

1266
01:28:49,455 --> 01:28:50,433
Why?

1267
01:28:51,324 --> 01:28:52,735
If I don't tell you, you won't go?

1268
01:28:59,465 --> 01:29:00,500
Train station.

1269
01:29:00,633 --> 01:29:02,704
Now don't ask me who's coming.

1270
01:29:03,803 --> 01:29:04,713
See for yourself.

1271
01:29:14,113 --> 01:29:16,218
Sir, I'm Tendulkar. He's Kohli.

1272
01:29:16,449 --> 01:29:17,519
And that's Sehwag.

1273
01:29:19,385 --> 01:29:21,763
You're the same one who
hung me from the swing, right?

1274
01:29:22,288 --> 01:29:23,358
No, sir.

1275
01:29:24,624 --> 01:29:26,433
That's my twin brother, sir!

1276
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:28,566
He's Shyam...

1277
01:29:29,295 --> 01:29:30,296
I'm Ram.

1278
01:29:52,318 --> 01:29:57,233
Humpty Dumpty!
Uncle said their driver was very cute.

1279
01:29:59,158 --> 01:30:00,432
You're smoking again!

1280
01:30:04,163 --> 01:30:05,733
What happened,
why do you look so tensed?

1281
01:30:11,404 --> 01:30:12,610
Do you love me?

1282
01:30:13,573 --> 01:30:14,483
No.

1283
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:16,178
I'm being serious.

1284
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:18,488
Of course I do.

1285
01:30:18,544 --> 01:30:19,522
Why do you love me?

1286
01:30:20,546 --> 01:30:21,490
What does that mean?

1287
01:30:21,547 --> 01:30:24,460
I mean... why?
What do I have that Angad doesn't?

1288
01:30:25,685 --> 01:30:26,686
I don't know.

1289
01:30:26,753 --> 01:30:27,788
You don't know?!

1290
01:30:29,722 --> 01:30:31,463
Love isn't by reason, Humpty.

1291
01:30:31,491 --> 01:30:32,731
Shouldn't there be a reason?

1292
01:30:33,326 --> 01:30:37,365
What do I say when Sir asks
me why I'm better for you than Angad?

1293
01:30:37,764 --> 01:30:39,801
He's better looking than me,
he earns more than me...

1294
01:30:40,066 --> 01:30:41,340
he's fit, he doesn't drink...

1295
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,572
he even cooks!

1296
01:30:43,069 --> 01:30:44,377
He's friggin‘ Superman!

1297
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:48,344
I'm barely Charlie Brown.

1298
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:52,487
Yeah. Correct!

1299
01:30:53,546 --> 01:30:54,820
You're right...

1300
01:30:55,648 --> 01:30:57,127
Shall I marry him?

1301
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:01,462
Bloody sympathy monger...

1302
01:31:01,788 --> 01:31:04,200
When I say I love you, I mean it!

1303
01:31:06,359 --> 01:31:07,702
Stop these crocodile tears.

1304
01:31:16,302 --> 01:31:19,715
- Oh, Humpty! Okay... bye!

1305
01:31:24,377 --> 01:31:27,017
Hello, sister-in-law!

1306
01:31:27,613 --> 01:31:28,614
What happened to you?!

1307
01:31:28,681 --> 01:31:30,183
I can't...

1308
01:31:34,053 --> 01:31:35,123
What's wrong with Poplu?

1309
01:31:35,288 --> 01:31:37,598
School topper, college topper...

1310
01:31:37,657 --> 01:31:41,799
scholarship to university,
and first in his class in Medicine...

1311
01:31:42,061 --> 01:31:42,698
and still

1312
01:31:42,762 --> 01:31:43,604
And still, what?

1313
01:31:43,663 --> 01:31:46,542
And still I can't figure it out...

1314
01:31:46,599 --> 01:31:48,476
how is Angad so perfect?

1315
01:31:48,534 --> 01:31:49,308
So what if he is?

1316
01:31:49,368 --> 01:31:51,712
Either he's an angel in disguise...

1317
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:53,649
...OI'...

1318
01:31:53,806 --> 01:31:55,444
he's hiding something.

1319
01:31:56,175 --> 01:31:57,245
What is he hiding?

1320
01:31:57,710 --> 01:31:59,348
The dude is gay!

1321
01:31:59,412 --> 01:32:00,254
Don't talk rubbish!

1322
01:32:00,313 --> 01:32:03,590
He's gay! Look! Look at this!

1323
01:32:03,649 --> 01:32:06,459
Kissing, hugging... everything!

1324
01:32:06,819 --> 01:32:09,265
Okay, look at the other
guy's name... Ricky!

1325
01:32:09,288 --> 01:32:10,323
Are you sure?

1326
01:32:10,456 --> 01:32:12,800
Hundred percent sure!

1327
01:32:13,059 --> 01:32:14,834
I got it off Facebook... tell him!

1328
01:32:15,595 --> 01:32:21,204
And look at what Ricky wrote...
'The love of my life'!

1329
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,175
What is this, man?!

1330
01:32:23,236 --> 01:32:24,340
What is it?

1331
01:32:24,403 --> 01:32:25,575
It's like thiiiis!

1332
01:32:25,638 --> 01:32:27,208
What else could it be?

1333
01:32:27,473 --> 01:32:28,679
This could be incorrect!

1334
01:32:28,741 --> 01:32:29,685
Hello!

1335
01:32:30,343 --> 01:32:35,383
Shonty has never been wrong...
nor will he ever be.

1336
01:32:37,149 --> 01:32:38,184
Okay?

1337
01:32:38,251 --> 01:32:39,594
Bro, I've saved your wedding!

1338
01:32:39,652 --> 01:32:42,132
Say thank you and
let's go to Singh sir.

1339
01:32:42,188 --> 01:32:43,166
Are you stupid?!

1340
01:32:43,222 --> 01:32:45,099
You want me to take
this paper to Singh sir?

1341
01:32:45,157 --> 01:32:46,761
I need hard evidence!

1342
01:32:47,093 --> 01:32:49,471
We need to hear Angad say it!
“l am GAY.“

1343
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:55,207
People suffer from such sad things...

1344
01:32:56,402 --> 01:32:59,872
Thought he was a stud...
but he's gay...

1345
01:33:01,474 --> 01:33:03,476
Brooo...

1346
01:33:29,769 --> 01:33:30,713
You... are you insane?!

1347
01:33:31,170 --> 01:33:32,649
I didn't ask for a bath!

1348
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:35,184
What happened?!

1349
01:33:35,241 --> 01:33:36,345
Why are you sulking?!

1350
01:33:36,409 --> 01:33:37,410
I don't want to talk to you!

1351
01:33:37,476 --> 01:33:38,784
I'm sorry, Kavya!

1352
01:33:39,312 --> 01:33:41,588
I waited all night for
you thinking you'd come!

1353
01:33:41,647 --> 01:33:42,853
You didn't even answer your phone!

1354
01:33:43,215 --> 01:33:45,422
I'm sorry! I fell asleep, I was tired!

1355
01:33:45,484 --> 01:33:46,485
But listen, I have good news!

1356
01:33:46,552 --> 01:33:49,556
Yeah! You sleep while
I get married off to Angad!

1357
01:33:49,588 --> 01:33:50,828
But listen to my good news!

1358
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:52,260
I have good news!!!

1359
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,732
You remember what to do, right?

1360
01:33:56,395 --> 01:33:57,373
Yes!

1361
01:33:58,364 --> 01:34:00,105
Humpty, please,
I can't do this! Sorry!

1362
01:34:00,166 --> 01:34:01,406
Shut up and go!

1363
01:34:08,474 --> 01:34:09,384
Hey!

1364
01:34:09,608 --> 01:34:10,848
Can I ask you something?

1365
01:34:11,377 --> 01:34:12,412
It's a little personal...

1366
01:34:12,545 --> 01:34:14,650
Sure... go ahead!

1367
01:34:15,247 --> 01:34:18,319
You have such a good personality...

1368
01:34:18,551 --> 01:34:21,828
People must hit on you all time?

1369
01:34:23,255 --> 01:34:24,700
Yeah, sometimes!

1370
01:34:25,257 --> 01:34:27,430
Men... Women... both?

1371
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:30,140
Ya... but that's
kind of normal, right?

1372
01:34:30,196 --> 01:34:32,142
Yeah, now it's normal in India also!

1373
01:34:32,198 --> 01:34:34,508
Society's becoming open-minded!

1374
01:34:35,334 --> 01:34:36,540
That's good to know...

1375
01:34:36,836 --> 01:34:40,079
You don't need to be afraid or hide...

1376
01:34:40,439 --> 01:34:41,782
Everything is open!

1377
01:34:48,347 --> 01:34:49,291
Hey, what's up?

1378
01:34:50,249 --> 01:34:51,227
What are you doing here?

1379
01:34:51,484 --> 01:34:54,328
It's important to nourish yourself...

1380
01:34:58,557 --> 01:34:59,592
Thanks...

1381
01:35:33,659 --> 01:35:35,332
I can't do this anymore, man!

1382
01:35:35,394 --> 01:35:39,308
If Angad isn't, I'll definitely
be gay by the end of this!

1383
01:35:39,799 --> 01:35:41,176
What are you doing here?

1384
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:43,780
Granny's making pickle
for Angad‘s family...

1385
01:35:43,803 --> 01:35:45,612
She sent us to get these jars!

1386
01:35:47,673 --> 01:35:49,277
You tell your family!

1387
01:35:49,341 --> 01:35:51,548
I'm going to be the groom!
Not a waiter!

1388
01:35:55,381 --> 01:35:56,519
I don't want to eat.

1389
01:35:59,185 --> 01:36:00,459
I'm sorry for this morning...

1390
01:36:00,653 --> 01:36:01,859
I was angry!

1391
01:36:04,657 --> 01:36:05,761
Sorry about last night.

1392
01:36:11,797 --> 01:36:13,333
The bread is burnt...

1393
01:36:14,133 --> 01:36:15,407
and the soup is bland.

1394
01:36:15,634 --> 01:36:17,409
The side dish is average...

1395
01:36:18,471 --> 01:36:20,178
But, I'll cook for you everyday...

1396
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:21,582
and I'll become perfect.

1397
01:36:23,309 --> 01:36:24,447
I don't want perfect.

1398
01:36:25,511 --> 01:36:26,819
I'll have whatever you give me.

1399
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:29,157
For now, take a slap.

1400
01:36:34,553 --> 01:36:35,497
Now you eat.

1401
01:36:35,554 --> 01:36:37,056
No, I...

1402
01:36:37,123 --> 01:36:38,568
No, eat.
It's very good, best in Ambala!

1403
01:36:49,568 --> 01:36:51,479
"I feel naughty naughty"

1404
01:36:56,842 --> 01:36:59,288
"I feel naughty naughty"

1405
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:05,490
"I feel naughty naughty"

1406
01:37:05,551 --> 01:37:09,431
“The wisemen couldn't tell you
Did the chicken come before the egg?“

1407
01:37:09,488 --> 01:37:12,867
“Leave the lofty thinking
And listen to my tale!“

1408
01:37:13,125 --> 01:37:16,572
“The wisemen couldn't tell you
Did the chicken come before the egg?“

1409
01:37:16,629 --> 01:37:20,133
“Leave the lofty thinking
And listen to my tale!“

1410
01:37:20,199 --> 01:37:23,669
“The hen, she cried all night
And she couldn't sleep a wink“

1411
01:37:23,869 --> 01:37:27,578
“The rooster must‘ve been
naughty Eggs don't come by magic!“

1412
01:37:27,673 --> 01:37:30,347
“Oh, when I watch you dance...“

1413
01:37:35,347 --> 01:37:36,257
“Oh, when I watch you dance...“

1414
01:37:36,315 --> 01:37:38,090
"I feel naughty naughty"

1415
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:40,289
"I feel naughty naughty"

1416
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:42,161
“Oh, when I watch you dance“

1417
01:37:42,221 --> 01:37:43,427
“Oh, when I watch you dance“

1418
01:37:43,489 --> 01:37:45,298
"I feel naughty naughty"

1419
01:37:45,357 --> 01:37:47,166
"I feel naughty naughty"

1420
01:37:47,226 --> 01:37:49,729
“Oh, everyone feels naughty naughty“

1421
01:38:04,243 --> 01:38:07,690
“Forget your silly
tales of fantasy and love“

1422
01:38:07,746 --> 01:38:11,319
"I met your grandfather
when he was only but a boy"

1423
01:38:11,450 --> 01:38:15,125
“Just a little girl was
I when I became his bride“

1424
01:38:15,187 --> 01:38:18,191
"Sent away from home
as a naive little child"

1425
01:38:18,257 --> 01:38:21,830
"All night I cried and
tried but couldn't sleep"

1426
01:38:22,094 --> 01:38:25,769
“When grandfather whispered softly“

1427
01:38:29,501 --> 01:38:31,208
“Oh, when I watch you dance“

1428
01:38:31,270 --> 01:38:32,510
“Oh, when I watch you dance“

1429
01:38:32,571 --> 01:38:34,414
"I feel naughty naughty"

1430
01:38:34,473 --> 01:38:36,282
"I feel naughty naughty"

1431
01:38:36,342 --> 01:38:38,822
“Oh, everyone feels naughty naughty“

1432
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:43,823
“Come now, listen closely to my saga“

1433
01:38:44,049 --> 01:38:47,553
"I was a college student
and your father a mechanic"

1434
01:38:47,753 --> 01:38:51,200
“When he caught my hand and said,
listen to me my darling!“

1435
01:38:51,257 --> 01:38:55,171
“However, whenever,
wherever, I'll marry only you.“

1436
01:38:56,295 --> 01:38:59,765
Ask him what happened after!

1437
01:38:59,832 --> 01:39:01,470
“Naughty, naughty, naughty, naught)!"

1438
01:39:01,533 --> 01:39:07,779
“Landed up at her father's house,
and he didn't listen to a word“

1439
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,285
“But his beatings
couldn't shake me off“

1440
01:39:09,341 --> 01:39:14,723
“And he finally let her be
my bride Oh, then she became my bride“

1441
01:39:14,780 --> 01:39:18,353
“Then naughty,
naughty, naughty, naughty“

1442
01:39:18,417 --> 01:39:19,794
“We got naughty naughty"

1443
01:39:19,852 --> 01:39:22,230
“Oh we got naughty naughty"

1444
01:39:22,288 --> 01:39:23,596
“When I see you dance“

1445
01:39:23,656 --> 01:39:25,363
“We got naughty naughty"

1446
01:39:25,424 --> 01:39:28,303
“My heart feels naughty naughty“

1447
01:39:31,697 --> 01:39:38,672
“Nevermind what they say,
I know my love was true...“

1448
01:39:39,038 --> 01:39:46,047
“But what I thought was destiny
was not really meant to be“

1449
01:39:46,111 --> 01:39:49,285
"it was not meant to be"

1450
01:39:49,348 --> 01:39:53,319
“No one knows what fate has planned“

1451
01:39:53,385 --> 01:39:57,060
“Forget the past,
the future is bright“

1452
01:39:57,122 --> 01:40:00,399
“Come on,
dear girl, give us a smile...“

1453
01:40:00,459 --> 01:40:04,532
“Come now, give us a smile...“

1454
01:40:07,633 --> 01:40:09,135
“Oh when I see you dance...“

1455
01:40:09,201 --> 01:40:10,805
"I feel naughty naughty"

1456
01:40:11,070 --> 01:40:13,209
"I feel naughty naughty"

1457
01:40:13,272 --> 01:40:14,615
“Oh, when I watch you dance“

1458
01:40:14,673 --> 01:40:16,346
"I feel naughty naughty"

1459
01:40:16,408 --> 01:40:18,547
"I feel naughty naughty"

1460
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:20,453
“Oh, when I watch you dance“

1461
01:40:20,512 --> 01:40:21,786
“Oh, when I watch you dance“

1462
01:40:21,847 --> 01:40:23,656
"I feel naughty naughty"

1463
01:40:23,716 --> 01:40:25,491
"I feel naughty naughty"

1464
01:40:25,551 --> 01:40:28,122
“Oh, everyone feels naughty naughty“

1465
01:40:50,776 --> 01:40:52,119
It's okay.

1466
01:40:53,612 --> 01:40:55,387
Everything will be alright.

1467
01:40:55,447 --> 01:40:56,755
What are you talking about?

1468
01:40:56,815 --> 01:40:58,453
I didn't understand...

1469
01:40:58,517 --> 01:41:00,224
I've been noticing you all day.

1470
01:41:01,787 --> 01:41:03,289
I know you love me.

1471
01:41:13,298 --> 01:41:14,368
But, it's not possible.

1472
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:15,378
Why?!

1473
01:41:15,534 --> 01:41:16,740
Because you love Ricky?

1474
01:41:16,769 --> 01:41:17,509
Ricky?

1475
01:41:17,569 --> 01:41:20,175
Don't lie... It's on Facebook!

1476
01:41:20,672 --> 01:41:22,413
Poplu, Ricky is my best friend!

1477
01:41:22,708 --> 01:41:24,187
He's gay... I'm not!

1478
01:41:24,410 --> 01:41:25,684
I like women.

1479
01:41:28,347 --> 01:41:30,657
Poplu... you're a great guy...

1480
01:41:33,385 --> 01:41:34,386
but, I'm sorry.

1481
01:41:34,453 --> 01:41:35,454
No problem.

1482
01:41:35,521 --> 01:41:36,522
It's okay.

1483
01:41:36,789 --> 01:41:39,030
Have you told your
friends that you're gay?

1484
01:41:39,558 --> 01:41:41,037
If you want...

1485
01:41:41,093 --> 01:41:42,128
I'll come with you.

1486
01:41:42,194 --> 01:41:43,639
No... not now.

1487
01:41:44,096 --> 01:41:46,133
I'll tell them later!

1488
01:41:52,805 --> 01:41:54,284
This was your stupid plan?

1489
01:41:54,339 --> 01:41:55,579
I told them that!

1490
01:41:55,641 --> 01:41:57,621
Instead,
they sacrificed my masculinity...

1491
01:41:57,676 --> 01:41:58,416
Kavya, I'm trying!

1492
01:41:58,477 --> 01:41:59,547
Not a word from you!

1493
01:42:00,145 --> 01:42:01,647
If you can't do anything,
go back to Delhi!

1494
01:42:01,713 --> 01:42:03,215
Stop these immature antics!

1495
01:42:03,749 --> 01:42:05,422
My marriage is next week!

1496
01:42:05,484 --> 01:42:06,724
I told you!

1497
01:42:06,785 --> 01:42:07,661
Get lost!

1498
01:42:07,719 --> 01:42:09,062
I'm not talking to you guys!

1499
01:42:12,257 --> 01:42:14,328
No more ideas, please! Please!

1500
01:42:36,448 --> 01:42:38,325
Do you know this boy well?

1501
01:42:39,151 --> 01:42:41,495
No... Just met him
when he came to tie me up.

1502
01:42:45,791 --> 01:42:48,169
You can't laugh at me, brother-in-law!

1503
01:42:49,561 --> 01:42:51,472
Its in your fate to be tied up!

1504
01:42:51,830 --> 01:42:55,437
Remember how I had
tied you to the tree?

1505
01:43:02,207 --> 01:43:04,380
He was a big help to Kavya‘s friend,
Gurpreet.

1506
01:43:07,145 --> 01:43:08,419
He saved her marriage.

1507
01:43:11,416 --> 01:43:13,157
Your dad used to be a mechanic?

1508
01:43:16,722 --> 01:43:19,259
My bike's carburetor
needs to be cleaned...

1509
01:43:19,324 --> 01:43:20,428
can I call him?

1510
01:43:22,694 --> 01:43:25,436
Who will clean your dirty mind?

1511
01:43:25,497 --> 01:43:27,636
You're the mechanic of my body, baby.

1512
01:43:28,333 --> 01:43:31,314
Yuck! Weirdo...

1513
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:38,383
Go to sleep, now...
Jogging in the morning...

1514
01:43:38,443 --> 01:43:39,387
Nooo...

1515
01:43:46,685 --> 01:43:48,255
Angad didn't come today, sir?

1516
01:43:50,188 --> 01:43:51,599
He doesn't jog to impress me.

1517
01:43:52,291 --> 01:43:54,293
I don't jog to impress you, either.

1518
01:43:54,359 --> 01:43:55,667
I jog for Kavya sake.

1519
01:43:57,829 --> 01:44:01,777
Maybe I can learn something from Angad
and be a better person for Kavya.

1520
01:44:05,203 --> 01:44:06,807
ls that why you smoke cigarettes?

1521
01:44:07,506 --> 01:44:09,577
The cigarettes are for me...

1522
01:44:09,641 --> 01:44:12,520
I can become a better for Kavya,
but can't fundamentally change.

1523
01:44:27,259 --> 01:44:28,329
Kavya...

1524
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:29,661
Kavya...

1525
01:44:31,263 --> 01:44:32,241
Kavya...

1526
01:44:35,634 --> 01:44:36,669
Did you need something?

1527
01:44:37,235 --> 01:44:38,475
Can't I talk to you
without needing something?

1528
01:44:40,672 --> 01:44:41,616
Just kidding.

1529
01:44:42,074 --> 01:44:43,553
I want to take you for dinner.

1530
01:44:43,842 --> 01:44:45,150
Just the two of us.

1531
01:44:46,244 --> 01:44:47,655
We're getting married in a week...

1532
01:44:47,713 --> 01:44:49,488
we should get to know each other.

1533
01:44:50,282 --> 01:44:52,284
So, I wanted to spend
some time with you.

1534
01:44:54,586 --> 01:44:58,295
There are too many people
in the house for us to talk freely.

1535
01:44:58,757 --> 01:44:59,701
So, tonight?

1536
01:44:59,858 --> 01:45:01,428
You and me.

1537
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:03,238
It's a date.

1538
01:45:03,261 --> 01:45:05,400
BYe- - Bye.

1539
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:12,112
You're the first man in the world,
making pickles for his competitor.

1540
01:45:12,638 --> 01:45:13,810
Oh, wow, she looks angry!

1541
01:45:14,773 --> 01:45:15,774
What the hell are you doing?!

1542
01:45:15,841 --> 01:45:17,184
What the hell are YOU doing?!

1543
01:45:17,242 --> 01:45:19,483
Are you here to marry
me or attend Angad‘s wedding?!

1544
01:45:19,544 --> 01:45:20,716
What's wrong?

1545
01:45:20,779 --> 01:45:22,588
Angad‘s parents are
coming tomorrow itself!

1546
01:45:22,714 --> 01:45:24,591
Now, you have only tonight.

1547
01:45:24,716 --> 01:45:27,196
Tomorrow my father will
ask you why Angad is wrong for me.

1548
01:45:27,252 --> 01:45:29,254
What are you going to say?

1549
01:45:30,589 --> 01:45:31,761
Don't look away, Humpty!

1550
01:45:32,124 --> 01:45:33,102
What do I do?!

1551
01:45:33,158 --> 01:45:34,660
What do I do if Angad is Mr. Perfect?!

1552
01:45:34,726 --> 01:45:37,434
Beat him? Threaten him? Kill him?!

1553
01:45:38,296 --> 01:45:40,674
Do nothing! Sit here and make pickle!

1554
01:45:49,608 --> 01:45:51,610
He wants to take me on a date!

1555
01:45:53,812 --> 01:45:55,587
I don't want to go on a date...

1556
01:45:55,814 --> 01:45:57,259
Don't go, Kavya...

1557
01:46:00,752 --> 01:46:02,698
Do something, Humpty...

1558
01:46:06,425 --> 01:46:08,098
Do something.

1559
01:46:29,648 --> 01:46:31,218
Humpty won't come today.

1560
01:46:34,486 --> 01:46:37,296
One... two... three!

1561
01:46:39,725 --> 01:46:41,204
He's just like you.

1562
01:46:42,094 --> 01:46:43,437
He has honesty in his eyes.

1563
01:46:45,230 --> 01:46:46,675
He loves Kavya very much.

1564
01:46:51,837 --> 01:46:54,716
I'm going to Delhi tomorrow
to pick my parents.

1565
01:46:55,307 --> 01:46:56,445
I'd like you to come with me.

1566
01:47:04,683 --> 01:47:07,596
Angad... those boys are staring at me.

1567
01:47:15,427 --> 01:47:16,462
Ignore them.

1568
01:47:17,529 --> 01:47:20,237
You're concerned that
he doesn't earn enough?

1569
01:47:20,298 --> 01:47:21,140
You were the same when...

1570
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:22,473
Please stop, both of you!

1571
01:47:25,704 --> 01:47:28,583
My decision is... final.

1572
01:47:29,141 --> 01:47:35,217
Son, your problem is that
you want to control everything.

1573
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:38,754
You can control your
children's lives...

1574
01:47:39,251 --> 01:47:43,495
but you can't control
what life has in store for them.

1575
01:47:44,122 --> 01:47:48,195
“Oh, these mesmerizing eyes...“

1576
01:47:48,226 --> 01:47:51,639
Kavya! Don't look at them...
They're drunk!

1577
01:47:52,664 --> 01:47:54,735
I didn't control Swati...

1578
01:47:55,233 --> 01:47:56,143
look what happened!

1579
01:47:56,201 --> 01:47:58,511
So you can assure Kavya‘s
happiness by controlling her?

1580
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:03,348
Can you guarantee
that she will never cry?

1581
01:48:03,675 --> 01:48:05,814
That she will always
be cheerful and happy?

1582
01:48:06,311 --> 01:48:07,790
Go on, give us a guarantee!

1583
01:48:09,681 --> 01:48:11,285
Kavya, don't react!

1584
01:48:11,349 --> 01:48:13,420
We'll finish our dinner and leave.

1585
01:48:15,854 --> 01:48:17,265
One more beer, please!

1586
01:48:17,322 --> 01:48:19,324
Ohhh, she's pissed off!

1587
01:48:21,259 --> 01:48:24,103
If God himself can't control
the fate of the world...

1588
01:48:25,630 --> 01:48:28,236
who are you to
control anyone's destiny?

1589
01:48:30,468 --> 01:48:31,776
Don't!

1590
01:48:34,139 --> 01:48:35,516
Put the phone down.

1591
01:48:36,074 --> 01:48:38,714
“Some boys are being
sleazy with me...“

1592
01:48:43,248 --> 01:48:44,693
Angad is a good man, Ma.

1593
01:48:46,418 --> 01:48:48,420
He's a very good man...

1594
01:48:49,688 --> 01:48:53,135
but, Humpty is the best
person for your precious Kavya.

1595
01:49:02,067 --> 01:49:03,068
He's being openly lewd!

1596
01:49:03,134 --> 01:49:04,135
What do you want me to do?

1597
01:49:04,736 --> 01:49:05,680
Beat him?

1598
01:49:05,737 --> 01:49:07,478
Do something! Don't just sit there!

1599
01:49:07,539 --> 01:49:09,348
Kavya... I've asked for the bill.

1600
01:49:09,507 --> 01:49:10,645
Let's pay and leave.

1601
01:49:10,709 --> 01:49:12,347
There's no point fighting with them.

1602
01:49:24,089 --> 01:49:25,466
What are you looking at?!

1603
01:49:25,523 --> 01:49:29,164
Oh, Lady Gaga... where are you going?

1604
01:49:29,227 --> 01:49:31,571
Aren't you going
to have a drink with me?

1605
01:49:31,630 --> 01:49:33,576
Listen, buddy.
We don't want any trouble.

1606
01:49:34,599 --> 01:49:37,102
Look at this English Gentleman!

1607
01:49:40,071 --> 01:49:41,550
Humpty! Stop it, Humpty!

1608
01:49:41,606 --> 01:49:42,641
Let me go!

1609
01:49:45,710 --> 01:49:47,314
Humpty! Humpty, don't!

1610
01:50:17,175 --> 01:50:19,416
Singh sir, please don't thank us.

1611
01:50:20,245 --> 01:50:22,225
Your kids are like our kids.

1612
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:25,393
Good thing Angad called us in time...

1613
01:50:25,450 --> 01:50:27,054
Can you come with me?

1614
01:50:27,218 --> 01:50:29,596
I want to lodge a complaint.

1615
01:50:29,654 --> 01:50:31,793
Don't let those guys go.

1616
01:50:41,066 --> 01:50:42,067
Angad...

1617
01:50:45,070 --> 01:50:46,378
bring them home.

1618
01:50:47,339 --> 01:50:49,319
They're in no state to drive.

1619
01:51:15,834 --> 01:51:18,474
You all were rooting for this man?

1620
01:51:25,276 --> 01:51:28,086
I want you to leave
first thing tomorrow.

1621
01:51:29,247 --> 01:51:33,457
And never show your face here again.

1622
01:51:43,495 --> 01:51:44,439
Kavya...

1623
01:51:46,231 --> 01:51:47,232
Kavya...

1624
01:52:16,161 --> 01:52:16,832
Kavya.

1625
01:52:20,065 --> 01:52:22,739
Kavya, hurry up,
we have to leave in half an hour!

1626
01:52:24,335 --> 01:52:25,609
Kavya?

1627
01:52:27,806 --> 01:52:29,183
Kavya?

1628
01:52:43,254 --> 01:52:44,426
H u mpty! Where's Kavya?

1629
01:52:44,489 --> 01:52:45,490
I don't know...

1630
01:52:45,557 --> 01:52:47,366
Don't lie!
You're going to run away with her!

1631
01:52:47,425 --> 01:52:48,631
Can you tell me what's going on?

1632
01:52:48,693 --> 01:52:50,764
Kavya‘s not at home,
she's not answering her phone!

1633
01:52:50,829 --> 01:52:51,773
Tell me where she is!

1634
01:52:51,830 --> 01:52:53,241
If I had run away with her,
why would I come back?

1635
01:52:53,298 --> 01:52:54,743
We didn't even talk last night!

1636
01:52:54,799 --> 01:52:57,279
She's crazy!
Angad is leaving in 10 minutes.

1637
01:52:57,335 --> 01:52:59,372
If Dad finds out...
- Nothing will happen.

1638
01:52:59,471 --> 01:53:01,144
You handle Sir and Angad,
we'll find Kavya.

1639
01:53:01,206 --> 01:53:02,184
<i>Shanty!</i>

1640
01:53:02,273 --> 01:53:04,651
Humpty! You go,
we'll handle things here!

1641
01:53:06,377 --> 01:53:10,757
I'm getting a bad feeling
that we're going to get hit...

1642
01:53:18,423 --> 01:53:19,766
Sir, Bus Stop!

1643
01:53:23,261 --> 01:53:27,141
Everyone will come here first,
and then go to the hotel.

1644
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:30,637
Kavya‘s asked you'll to go ahead...
her stomach is upset.

1645
01:53:30,668 --> 01:53:33,376
She wants to set everything
up for your family members.

1646
01:53:33,605 --> 01:53:34,743
Nothing serious, I hope?

1647
01:53:34,806 --> 01:53:35,716
No.

1648
01:53:36,074 --> 01:53:41,080
Must be from eating out.

1649
01:53:41,846 --> 01:53:43,223
You leave. Don't get late.

1650
01:53:55,693 --> 01:53:56,603
Where is she?

1651
01:54:01,332 --> 01:54:02,367
Where is she?

1652
01:54:02,433 --> 01:54:04,606
I don't know anything, I was sleeping!

1653
01:54:05,603 --> 01:54:06,604
Tell me where they are!

1654
01:54:06,671 --> 01:54:08,651
Listen to us at least!

1655
01:54:12,377 --> 01:54:16,154
Sir, they haven't run away together.
He's gone to bring her back.

1656
01:54:17,315 --> 01:54:19,192
Kavya, are you crazy? Where are you?!

1657
01:54:19,584 --> 01:54:21,564
Yes, I'm alone! Where are you?

1658
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:24,327
Are you okay?
What are you doing there?

1659
01:54:24,622 --> 01:54:25,794
Wait there. I'm coming!

1660
01:54:32,430 --> 01:54:33,568
Where are you, man?

1661
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:37,135
He found Kavya!

1662
01:55:05,630 --> 01:55:06,665
What's going on?

1663
01:55:06,798 --> 01:55:08,334
Get inside,
the train is going to leave.

1664
01:55:08,399 --> 01:55:10,436
Let it go, you get down. Get down!

1665
01:55:10,768 --> 01:55:12,475
This is why I didn't
tell you last night!

1666
01:55:12,537 --> 01:55:14,483
I knew you'd do this drama!

1667
01:55:14,539 --> 01:55:16,314
Kavya, stop this nonsense... get down!

1668
01:55:16,541 --> 01:55:17,383
Sir is so worried!

1669
01:55:17,442 --> 01:55:18,420
Sir is worried?!

1670
01:55:18,476 --> 01:55:20,183
Do you care about him or me?!

1671
01:55:20,245 --> 01:55:22,418
Let's go from here!
We'll think of something!

1672
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:23,550
Think of what?!

1673
01:55:23,615 --> 01:55:24,719
What will we talk about?

1674
01:55:24,782 --> 01:55:27,285
Dad will just beat
you and throw you out!

1675
01:55:27,352 --> 01:55:29,093
Then, you'll be in Delhi
and I'll be in America!

1676
01:55:29,754 --> 01:55:31,791
I will make my own life decisions!
Not you and Dad!

1677
01:55:32,056 --> 01:55:32,659
Now get in!

1678
01:55:37,262 --> 01:55:38,798
Will you be happy like this?

1679
01:55:39,063 --> 01:55:41,703
Can you live without your family?!

1680
01:55:41,766 --> 01:55:44,337
Stop with the dialogues! Get in!

1681
01:55:44,736 --> 01:55:45,840
Oh, really? - Yes!

1682
01:55:47,538 --> 01:55:49,142
Okay, your decision is final.

1683
01:55:49,741 --> 01:55:51,448
Let's run away.
To hell with the family!

1684
01:56:14,832 --> 01:56:16,573
Why did you leave empty handed?

1685
01:56:16,701 --> 01:56:20,239
You could have taken your
expensive gown with you, at least?

1686
01:56:30,281 --> 01:56:32,192
You cheap man!

1687
01:56:33,518 --> 01:56:34,519
This was your plan?!

1688
01:56:34,552 --> 01:56:37,158
Enough, sir! We didn't try to elope!

1689
01:56:37,388 --> 01:56:39,493
If we were eloping,
we'd be on the train by now!

1690
01:56:39,824 --> 01:56:42,361
Not waiting for you on the platform!

1691
01:56:54,739 --> 01:56:57,743
Come to the corner there.

1692
01:56:58,743 --> 01:57:00,745
I want to talk to you... man to man.

1693
01:57:24,535 --> 01:57:26,515
Why is he pacing like this?

1694
01:57:28,139 --> 01:57:30,346
The pressure must be getting to him...

1695
01:57:35,046 --> 01:57:37,492
Firstly, it frightens me
out of my wits when you glare.

1696
01:57:38,316 --> 01:57:42,264
I've got lots to say but,
nothing comes out in front of you.

1697
01:57:46,457 --> 01:57:48,095
But today, I need to speak.

1698
01:57:49,794 --> 01:57:54,265
I apologize for the next 5 minutes,
because you won't be Mr. Singh for me.

1699
01:57:55,266 --> 01:57:57,405
You'll be Poplu.

1700
01:57:58,269 --> 01:58:02,308
My friend, my brother...
In front of whom I can speak freely.

1701
01:58:05,176 --> 01:58:07,315
Oye, Poplu!
What's the mechanic's problem?!

1702
01:58:07,345 --> 01:58:09,723
Why is he the only
one who can't see our love?

1703
01:58:12,483 --> 01:58:15,555
Angad is a great guy...
He has a big heart!

1704
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:16,564
Big everything!

1705
01:58:16,788 --> 01:58:18,358
He's a tree, I'm a shrub!

1706
01:58:18,389 --> 01:58:19,732
Small, insignificant...

1707
01:58:20,691 --> 01:58:23,467
But, what's the guarantee
that he'll make Kavya happy?

1708
01:58:23,494 --> 01:58:24,632
That he'll love her?

1709
01:58:25,430 --> 01:58:28,309
I have a lot of faults...
but one guarantee.

1710
01:58:28,699 --> 01:58:30,736
This shrub loves Kavya.

1711
01:58:32,403 --> 01:58:35,509
If we only have one piece of bread...

1712
01:58:36,174 --> 01:58:39,155
I'll give Kavya half and half to Dad.

1713
01:58:39,577 --> 01:58:41,579
I'll never let her sleep hungry.

1714
01:58:42,447 --> 01:58:45,053
Don't glare at me like Mr. Singh!

1715
01:58:47,251 --> 01:58:51,165
If every father insisted on
a perfect boy for their daughters...

1716
01:58:51,422 --> 01:58:53,493
even Mr.
Singh would still be a bachelor.

1717
01:58:56,060 --> 01:58:57,562
But who can explain this to him?

1718
01:58:58,062 --> 01:59:01,236
People aren't perfect...
relationships are perfect!

1719
01:59:04,502 --> 01:59:09,315
And anyone who is lewd
with Kavya will get beaten.

1720
01:59:10,174 --> 01:59:14,452
Whether there are 8 people or 80...
makes no difference.

1721
01:59:14,846 --> 01:59:18,817
In my place, Mr.
Singh would have done the same.

1722
01:59:19,317 --> 01:59:22,423
Can anyone so much
as look at his wife?

1723
01:59:24,288 --> 01:59:27,235
My brain is small,
but my heart is big.

1724
01:59:28,392 --> 01:59:31,635
If the mechanic can
understand... great.

1725
01:59:34,565 --> 01:59:39,036
And, Poplu...
if anyone so much as touches you'll...

1726
01:59:39,403 --> 01:59:42,475
I'll bury all of them in Ambala.

1727
01:59:43,341 --> 01:59:44,319
Jai Mata Di.

1728
01:59:52,817 --> 01:59:57,129
“You didn't do right with me“

1729
01:59:57,421 --> 02:00:00,630
“You didn't do right with me“

1730
02:00:00,691 --> 02:00:04,229
“By breaking my heart“

1731
02:00:04,295 --> 02:00:08,641
“These eyes are regretting it so much“

1732
02:00:08,699 --> 02:00:11,771
“These eyes are regretting it so much“

1733
02:00:11,836 --> 02:00:15,716
“By bonding with you“

1734
02:00:15,773 --> 02:00:20,313
"I" my prayers... ohm--

1735
02:00:20,378 --> 02:00:24,155
“Are only good wishes for you...“

1736
02:00:24,215 --> 02:00:28,664
“Listen to my proposal of adoration“

1737
02:00:28,719 --> 02:00:33,259
"I wait only for you..."

1738
02:00:33,324 --> 02:00:37,602
“You are my heart, my very being“

1739
02:00:37,662 --> 02:00:42,270
“How do I explain, my dear...“

1740
02:00:42,333 --> 02:00:44,370
“My heart is anxious without you“

1741
02:00:44,435 --> 02:00:46,210
Send the cars to the hotel!

1742
02:00:46,270 --> 02:00:48,216
Put Kavya‘s stuff in the car!

1743
02:01:06,090 --> 02:01:07,660
Why are you wearing this local gown?

1744
02:01:10,127 --> 02:01:11,299
Wear the designer one...

1745
02:01:13,464 --> 02:01:16,536
Since, you've been driving
everyone crazy about it for 3 months?

1746
02:01:21,205 --> 02:01:22,650
Designer didn't suit me...

1747
02:01:25,676 --> 02:01:27,280
Local is best for me.

1748
02:01:33,284 --> 02:01:35,560
When I didn't understand love...

1749
02:01:36,387 --> 02:01:39,027
...this gown meant everything to me.

1750
02:01:41,359 --> 02:01:43,771
Now, that I know love...
the gown has no value.

1751
02:01:52,470 --> 02:01:57,317
Wish I could exchange my
designer groom for a local one.

1752
02:02:05,082 --> 02:02:06,083
Hurry UP-

1753
02:02:07,551 --> 02:02:09,155
The wedding procession is almost here.

1754
02:04:17,148 --> 02:04:18,183
Stop it, Pop-

1755
02:04:23,154 --> 02:04:23,723
Sir?!

1756
02:04:28,092 --> 02:04:33,542
If you call me Poplu again,
I'll bury you.

1757
02:04:42,540 --> 02:04:45,248
Come on. Don't be so emotional.

1758
02:04:47,511 --> 02:04:50,321
Go, live your life!

1759
02:05:34,391 --> 02:05:36,393
Humpty Sharma!

1760
02:06:02,286 --> 02:06:04,129
We live only once...

1761
02:06:06,557 --> 02:06:11,506
Die only once... and...

1762
02:06:12,796 --> 02:06:14,742
I forget what comes next.

1763
02:06:22,339 --> 02:06:23,875
Hurry up, Humpty!

1764
02:06:26,210 --> 02:06:27,587
I've been waiting
for you for a long time.

1765
02:06:48,766 --> 02:06:50,143
You look hot.

1766
02:06:54,605 --> 02:06:56,209
I was born hot!

1767
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,621
Did you die when you
saw my Facebook status?

1768
02:07:08,585 --> 02:07:10,428
I thought... you left with that hunk.

1769
02:07:11,288 --> 02:07:12,358
Are you crazy?

1770
02:07:17,161 --> 02:07:18,469
I love you, man!

1771
02:07:19,229 --> 02:07:20,469
I love you, too.

1772
02:08:01,572 --> 02:08:05,611
“She's a small town girl“

1773
02:08:08,846 --> 02:08:12,589

“And she's ready to party again“

1783
02:08:52,723 --> 02:08:56,830
“Dressed to the nines,
she's off to the club“

1784
02:08:57,094 --> 02:09:00,598
“She's so hot, shots on the house!“

1785
02:09:00,664 --> 02:09:04,237
“She travels in style“

1786
02:09:04,301 --> 02:09:07,680
“And parties with the best“

1787
02:09:08,138 --> 02:09:13,588
“She calls herself a student but...“

1788
02:09:13,844 --> 02:09:15,323
"I have my doubts."

1789
02:09:15,479 --> 02:09:19,086
“Boys can't figure you out“

1790
02:09:19,149 --> 02:09:22,722
“Let you dupe them everyday“

1791
02:09:22,786 --> 02:09:28,065
“Arrives in a Honda,
leaves in an Audi...“

1792
02:09:28,325 --> 02:09:30,202
“Woah, baby, she's a hottie“

1793
02:09:30,260 --> 02:09:36,142
"24 hours a day,
you've got party on your mind“

1794
02:09:37,568 --> 02:09:41,311
"24 hours a day,
you've got party on your mind“

1795
02:09:41,371 --> 02:09:44,818
“Pretty pretty girls,
you're chasing all the time“

1796
02:09:45,075 --> 02:09:48,545
“You can go have your affairs“

1797
02:09:48,612 --> 02:09:51,821
“But come back to me at night“

1798
02:09:52,049 --> 02:09:55,553
