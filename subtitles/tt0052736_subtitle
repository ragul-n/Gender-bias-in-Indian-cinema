1
00:02:50,892 --> 00:02:51,788
''Mahesh, how was your paper?''

2
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:53,708
''First class, how was your paper?''

3
00:03:53,253 --> 00:03:55,109
l am extremely sorry.

4
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:57,028
By saying sorry my drape
and the cycle handle..

5
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:58,466
..and wheel won't get repaired!

6
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:00,866
Don't worry; l will
get your cycle repaired.

7
00:04:00,928 --> 00:04:02,785
Thanks a lot.

8
00:04:03,806 --> 00:04:05,663
''What happened, Mahesh?
- Pal, the cycles collided.''

9
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:11,421
''Only cycle collided, right?
Congratulations for the collision!''

10
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,216
Nowadays boys have
become very insolent.

11
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:18,134
''What happened, Meena?''

12
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:20,054
''Nothing, just cycles collided.''

13
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:21,973
''Only cycles, right?''

14
00:04:25,873 --> 00:04:27,729
Even the girls are no better.

15
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:30,607
''See, what you think is
incorrect. All girls aren't alike.''

16
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:35,405
Even your thinking is
incorrect. All boys aren't alike.

17
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:36,363
l know it.

18
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:38,281
''Come, l will get
your cycle repaired.''

19
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,241
''No, l have to reach home.''

20
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:41,161
''Come, l will reach you home.''

21
00:04:43,142 --> 00:04:45,959
Thanks! What a heavy cycle!

22
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,876
How far do you stay?

23
00:04:55,614 --> 00:04:57,470
''Give me my cycle
now, my house has come.''

24
00:04:58,492 --> 00:05:00,349
''So, this is your house.''

25
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:05,146
''lf you permit, l will
get your cycle repaired.''

26
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:09,945
No. Even so much
favor is enough.

27
00:05:37,828 --> 00:05:39,684
''Didi, Didi.''

28
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:42,562
''Didi, what
happened to your cycle?''

29
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,521
Accident.

30
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:46,401
Accident? Broken?
- Completely.

31
00:05:55,097 --> 00:05:58,874
''Mom, Meena's cycle has broken.
- Cycle broken? - Completely.''

32
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:02,711
Listen! Listen! Did you
hear? l told you something.

33
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:04,628
What to listen? Say
something at least.

34
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,507
Your darling Meena
has broken the cycle.

35
00:06:08,528 --> 00:06:09,424
Broken the cycle?

36
00:06:09,488 --> 00:06:12,305
Oh! Is she a girl or a
storm? A new damage everyday.

37
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:16,142
Where is she?
- Outside. - Outside?

38
00:06:18,122 --> 00:06:19,979
''Where is she, where is she?''

39
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,777
So my dear one has broken
the cycle. What had happened?

40
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:29,573
lt got collided with
another cycle. - Collided?

41
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:32,451
So what? Buy her a new cycle.

42
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:35,330
Twenty thousand was
Ieft by her father.

43
00:06:35,392 --> 00:06:37,248
You haven't spent
anything from it.

44
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,126
As if there won't be any
expenditure in the wedding.

45
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:43,966
l'll spend for the wedding if some
thing is left. What has happened..

46
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:46,843
..to you nowadays? Have some veil
covered your eyes? Have you lost..

47
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:48,761
...your eyesight? Do you've
any care or concern for anything?

48
00:06:48,823 --> 00:06:50,680
You damage something
or the other every day.

49
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:58,359
''lnstead of asking if she is hurt,
you are concerned with the damages!''

50
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:01,234
''What to ask, she is
standing here, hail and hearty.''

51
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,030
What can a maidservant ask?

52
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,869
When you were small l
used to enquire about you.

53
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,706
Now l want to see
these children happy.

54
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:15,624
My only wish is that
they lead a happy life.

55
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:19,463
''Come dear, come
and eat something.''

56
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:49,203
''Silence, Silence. Quiet please.''

57
00:07:52,144 --> 00:07:54,000
Just now we
presented some items.

58
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:59,759
Now we would present the
Iast surprise item to you.

59
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:07,434
ln our life some
moments are memorable.

60
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:13,191
''To make this moment memorable,
we would present a Mushaira.''

61
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:18,944
The topic of this Mushaira
would be Mohabbat (Love).

62
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:20,862
With whom?

63
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:22,782
''Let it be with anyone!
Let it happen, at least.''

64
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:29,500
Not real love. Only couplets
and poetry on the topic of love.

65
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,258
Both the girls and the boys
would present their point of views.

66
00:08:35,317 --> 00:08:38,133
From boys' side
Mr. Mahesh Kapoor.

67
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,647
And from girls' side
Miss Meena Khosla.

68
00:09:00,261 --> 00:09:03,078
''Ms. Meena and Mr.
Mahesh, on the stage please.''

69
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:15,550
''See we collided again, today!
- Better be careful, today. - Is it?''

70
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:51,022
l need the
support from your love.

71
00:09:52,069 --> 00:10:01,608
l need the
support from your love.

72
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:09,248
l am being faithful and
expect the same from you.

73
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:15,035
l need the
support from your love.

74
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:21,752
l am being faithful and
expect the same from you.

75
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:32,310
Asking for beautiful
damsels to be faithful!?

76
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:40,941
''You are so na'i've, don't know what
you are asking for! So very na'i've!''

77
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:53,411
By adorning your
hair with stars.

78
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:59,167
And by spreading blossoming
buds at your beautiful feet.

79
00:11:00,186 --> 00:11:10,686
l wish to build
a temple of love!

80
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:18,358
''And worship you, day and night!''

81
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:25,072
l am being faithful and
expect the same from you.

82
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,947
Consent of your love!

83
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:30,825
''Great, dear! Excellent! Wow!''

84
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:39,463
Just think before
giving your heart.

85
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:45,219
That one has to loose
before gaining something.

86
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:56,738
''Take permission
from the world, first.''

87
00:11:56,791 --> 00:12:04,377
That you wish to worship beauty!

88
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:13,012
''You are so na'i've, don't know what
you are asking for! So very na'i've!''

89
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,554
''How can one, who is
Iove struck by you, live?''

90
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:30,311
lt is impossible to
live without a companion!

91
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:40,836
Enough of the signals from far.

92
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:49,468
l wish to behold you from near.

93
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:55,256
l am being faithful and
expect the same from you.

94
00:12:55,314 --> 00:12:57,170
Consent of your love!

95
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:08,686
The whole world is
an enemy of love.

96
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:14,443
The destiny of
Iove is separation.

97
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:25,962
No one listens to the
sighs of the hearts.

98
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:34,594
And you want to ask
me from such a world?

99
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:42,268
''You are so na'i've, don't know what
you are asking for! So very na'i've!''

100
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:52,818
By holding the corner of
the drape in your lips!

101
00:13:53,837 --> 00:13:58,575
Just look at me smilingly.

102
00:13:58,634 --> 00:14:09,102
''Take me away from
myself, by coming near to me.''

103
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:17,733
Because l wish to
play with death!

104
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:25,408
l am being faithful and
expect the same from you.

105
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:28,314
Hail Mahesh! Great!

106
00:14:31,254 --> 00:14:36,952
All your claims and
promises are false!

107
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,748
How can love be
taken to its fulfillment?

108
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:53,234
''Here, life is controlled
by traditions and rituals.''

109
00:14:53,320 --> 00:15:00,939
You want to break
the traditions!?

110
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:08,614
''You are so na'i've, don't know what
you are asking for! So very na'i've!''

111
00:15:15,386 --> 00:15:20,124
Neither do l care for traditions
nor am l fearful of any rituals!

112
00:15:20,183 --> 00:15:25,881
All l am waiting
for is your decision.

113
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,677
Neither do l care for traditions
nor am l fearful of any rituals!

114
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:35,474
All l am waiting
for is your decision.

115
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:46,993
So what if the
path is difficult?

116
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:54,633
l wish to hold this hand!

117
00:15:54,722 --> 00:16:00,420
l am being faithful and
expect the same from you.

118
00:16:40,773 --> 00:16:43,590
''Greetings, sir! - Greetings.
- Here! Your letter. Bye.''

119
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:56,061
''My dear son, Mahesh.''

120
00:16:56,123 --> 00:16:57,980
We haven't written to
each other for so many days.

121
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:01,818
lt is one month since
your exams have been over.

122
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,736
But still no news from you.

123
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,655
Hope the papers went well.
May God give you success!

124
00:17:07,636 --> 00:17:09,493
l am bedridden since
the last one month.

125
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:14,292
''lf you want to see me, consider
this to be a telegram and come soon.''

126
00:17:16,271 --> 00:17:20,048
''Great father! Without
any ailment, you fall sick.''

127
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:21,965
And then get well
without any medicines!

128
00:17:24,905 --> 00:17:28,683
''Rai Sahib, nowadays boys
have become so uncontrollable.''

129
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:30,600
They don't care for
their fathers even.

130
00:17:31,621 --> 00:17:34,438
l must have written a thousand
Ietters to him but still no reply.

131
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:37,315
Shall l give you an idea?
- Tell me.

132
00:17:37,378 --> 00:17:41,155
''Send the news of your demise,
this time. Perhaps, he may come.''

133
00:17:43,134 --> 00:17:46,911
''You're joking! l am his father, till
now l was thinking of his studies.''

134
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:48,828
Now l am thinking of his future.

135
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,707
Don't worry about
that. Send Mahesh to me.

136
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:53,625
Can send him only when he comes.

137
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:57,465
''All the exams are over, don't know
which exam he is appearing for now!?''

138
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:34,335
l am putting a flower in your hair!
Your gaze lowers of bashfulness.

139
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:38,201
Don't know what l am
going to say today!

140
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:41,079
That my mouth is running dry
and the voice is getting choked!

141
00:19:42,035 --> 00:19:44,884
Seem to know this
couplet by heart!

142
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:47,794
''ln the hair of how many
girls, have you put the flowers?''

143
00:19:50,734 --> 00:19:55,472
Shall l tell you the truth?
- Yes. - Once!

144
00:19:58,409 --> 00:19:59,306
Whose?

145
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:03,144
''There is a girl, very beautiful!''

146
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,980
Who is she?

147
00:20:12,736 --> 00:20:13,664
Shall l tell?

148
00:20:20,476 --> 00:20:22,332
Let go of it! Leave it!

149
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:26,169
''Okay, wear it!''

150
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:52,075
Very fortunate!
- Who?

151
00:20:54,055 --> 00:20:58,792
Our collision! Do you
remember the collision?

152
00:21:01,186 --> 00:21:02,594
And after that..

153
00:21:02,689 --> 00:21:11,236
''After that, you'd say, we met, you
met, eyes met and the hearts met!''

154
00:21:13,658 --> 00:21:16,987
''Listen, l don't want a
Iove scene. Understood?''

155
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:22,774
What a beautiful climate!

156
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:53,484
The music of the heart
would start to play!

157
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:57,315
''The moment, you would smile!''

158
00:21:58,335 --> 00:22:03,072
''The moment, you would smile!''

159
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:12,670
''The world of us,
impatient ones, would be made!''

160
00:22:13,685 --> 00:22:18,422
''The moment, you would smile!''

161
00:22:18,482 --> 00:22:22,259
''The moment, you would smile!''

162
00:22:49,183 --> 00:22:53,920
With your smile the
springs will smile too!

163
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,717
And the shimmering row of
stars would smile as well!

164
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:02,554
With your smile the
surroundings will smile too!

165
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:07,352
The youthful
heartbeats would smile as well!

166
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:12,149
The youthful
heartbeats would smile as well!

167
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:16,946
The music of the heart
would start to play!

168
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:21,743
''The world of us,
impatient ones, would be made!''

169
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:25,579
''The moment, you would smile!''

170
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:31,337
''The moment, you would smile!''

171
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,077
The fragrance
enveloping the breeze!

172
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:05,875
Shadows of your
tresses on your eyes!

173
00:24:05,935 --> 00:24:10,672
''The springs of high
spirits, boiling within!''

174
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:14,509
These storms
whirling inside the hearts!

175
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:19,307
These storms
whirling inside the hearts!

176
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:24,103
The music of the heart
would start to play!

177
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:28,868
''The world of us,
impatient ones, would be made!''

178
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,737
''The moment, you would smile!''

179
00:24:33,757 --> 00:24:38,495
''The moment, you would smile!''

180
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:08,236
''These heavy clouds, showering!''

181
00:25:08,296 --> 00:25:12,073
''These restless souls, yearning!''

182
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:16,871
These embers
emanating from the breaths.

183
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:25,477
These bodies
melting in the heat!

184
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:31,262
The music of the heart
would start to play!

185
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:36,059
''The world of us,
impatient ones, would be made!''

186
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:40,856
''The moment, you would smile!''

187
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:45,653
''The moment, you would smile!''

188
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:08,158
We committed a big mistake.

189
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:11,038
This.. this is sin.

190
00:27:13,977 --> 00:27:15,834
''You are right, Meena.''

191
00:27:16,855 --> 00:27:19,672
We shouldn't have
committed such a mistake.

192
00:27:21,652 --> 00:27:23,509
We both are guilty in
the eyes of the society.

193
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:31,184
''lt is over two
months, the exams got over.''

194
00:27:31,246 --> 00:27:33,103
The boy doesn't
even think of coming.

195
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:38,862
''Whenever l write to him,
he postpones it, somehow.''

196
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:42,699
''Okay, son, l am your father.
Will write to you again.''

197
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:45,575
Dear Mahesh..

198
00:27:46,597 --> 00:27:52,295
..l met Rai Sahib Mr. Laxmi
Narayan regarding your job.

199
00:27:52,353 --> 00:27:55,170
But he wants to meet you.

200
00:27:55,231 --> 00:27:59,969
''lf he happens to like
you, you will go places.''

201
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:03,805
''You will get car,
bungalow et all.''

202
00:28:04,825 --> 00:28:07,642
''Dear Mahesh, one doesn't
get such jobs everyday.''

203
00:28:07,704 --> 00:28:09,560
Come here as soon as
you read this letter.

204
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:14,358
''Very good, a bungalow and a car!''

205
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:17,236
Great father! You are simply great!
What a job you have searched!

206
00:28:17,298 --> 00:28:19,154
What else is written?

207
00:28:19,216 --> 00:28:22,993
lf you don't come upon receiving
the letter then l will come there.

208
00:28:23,054 --> 00:28:24,910
''O father, why do
you take the trouble?''

209
00:28:24,973 --> 00:28:26,829
l will be there by
the morning train!

210
00:28:30,729 --> 00:28:38,315
l wish to get the
support of your love!

211
00:28:38,404 --> 00:28:46,023
l am being faithful and
expect the same from you!

212
00:28:50,877 --> 00:28:51,773
''Coming, auntie!''

213
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,840
No.. no!!!

214
00:29:46,937 --> 00:29:48,346
''Come, Meena.''

215
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,217
Good that you have come.
l was about to visit you.

216
00:30:02,832 --> 00:30:04,688
''Meena, what's the matter?''

217
00:30:07,629 --> 00:30:11,406
''Mahesh, are you going somewhere?''

218
00:30:12,426 --> 00:30:16,203
''Meena, didn't wish to go, but
father has threatened me to come.''

219
00:30:17,223 --> 00:30:18,119
So l have to go.

220
00:30:19,141 --> 00:30:21,958
''But Meena, what brings you
here so early in the morning?''

221
00:30:24,354 --> 00:30:27,683
''There is no morning for
me, only night and darkness.''

222
00:30:28,735 --> 00:30:31,552
''What are you talking,
Meena? What has happened?''

223
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,389
That which
shouldn't have happened.

224
00:30:38,329 --> 00:30:40,186
l am expecting.
- What did you say?

225
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:43,063
Meena.. you.. expecting?

226
00:30:44,086 --> 00:30:47,863
Very unfortunate!
What will happen now?

227
00:30:49,778 --> 00:30:50,737
What should be done now?

228
00:30:53,136 --> 00:30:56,465
''Marry me Mahesh, marry me.''

229
00:30:57,933 --> 00:31:01,262
''Marriage? Yes, we should definitely
get married. There is no other way.''

230
00:31:05,193 --> 00:31:07,049
''No sooner l reach, l'll talk to
father & compel him for this wedding.''

231
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,806
''Mahesh, l
expected this from you.''

232
00:31:13,827 --> 00:31:18,565
''Don't worry, Meena, l will go
today and will be back soon.''

233
00:31:19,584 --> 00:31:23,361
''And yes, write to me
as soon as you reach.''

234
00:31:23,421 --> 00:31:26,238
''Sure. l will write to you tomorrow,
you will get it by the day after.''

235
00:31:30,137 --> 00:31:31,993
l will be waiting for you.

236
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,873
''l will be back very soon,
Meena, l'll be back very soon.''

237
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:55,018
Postman.

238
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:16,126
ls there no letter of mine?
- No madam.

239
00:32:23,863 --> 00:32:29,561
''Girl is beautiful, well behaved
and educated. l have met her.''

240
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:32,436
l like her. Even
you can meet her.

241
00:32:32,498 --> 00:32:34,354
''But father, what's the hurry?''

242
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:38,194
l am in a hurry because
Rai Sahib is a billionaire.

243
00:32:38,254 --> 00:32:41,071
He is having only one
daughter moreover he is sick.

244
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:42,989
''He can have a heart stroke anytime.
Earlier the wedding, better it is.''

245
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,707
''l won't commit for this
wedding, father. Refuse them.''

246
00:32:50,727 --> 00:32:54,504
Huh! Refuse them? Idiot!
l am also your father.

247
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:57,380
Let me also see how
he doesn't marry here.

248
00:33:39,656 --> 00:33:42,473
''ls there any letter of mine?
- No, my cycle's chain came out.''

249
00:34:42,017 --> 00:34:46,754
''Didi, Didi, get us sweets!
Get us sweets. - For what?''

250
00:34:46,814 --> 00:34:50,591
First give us the money.
- You have passed! - See this.

251
00:34:56,408 --> 00:34:59,225
''Daughter, don't
forget my sweets.''

252
00:35:01,205 --> 00:35:03,061
''Our Didi has
passed, in first class!''

253
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:05,940
''How can l forget you, auntie?''

254
00:35:06,002 --> 00:35:09,779
''What happened, dear?
Aren't you happy upon passing?''

255
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:15,536
''l am happy, very happy, auntie.''

256
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:28,008
Have you come to tell me you
have passed? l already know it.

257
00:35:29,028 --> 00:35:30,884
''No, auntie, l want
to go out for one day.''

258
00:35:30,946 --> 00:35:34,724
''Sure, sure, your father
Ieft Rupees 20 thousand.''

259
00:35:35,743 --> 00:35:37,600
''ln 20 years not even a single
penny has been spent, right?''

260
00:35:38,622 --> 00:35:41,438
''No auntie, l don't want
money. l have some on me.''

261
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,317
ls that am l some ticket
clerk to give you tickets?

262
00:35:44,378 --> 00:35:47,195
Or am l a train coach to
carry you to your destination?

263
00:35:48,216 --> 00:35:52,953
''Nothing of the sort, auntie. My
friend has called me on her wedding.''

264
00:35:53,013 --> 00:35:54,869
Where am l saying that
some enemy has called you?

265
00:35:55,827 --> 00:35:57,715
Why are you asking me?
Go.. and go definitely.

266
00:35:58,769 --> 00:36:01,586
Tell uncle that l will be
back by the day after tomorrow.

267
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:04,464
''Whether you come tomorrow or the
day after, l will tell him.''

268
00:36:04,525 --> 00:36:07,342
And if you don't come then
also l will tell him. Okay?

269
00:37:07,846 --> 00:37:10,663
''Listen, where is street No. 5?''

270
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:12,580
Go straight and first left.

271
00:37:15,521 --> 00:37:16,417
Thank you.

272
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:50,961
l am being faithful and
expect the same from you.

273
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:56,717
l need the
support from your love.

274
00:37:56,775 --> 00:38:02,473
l am being faithful and
expect the same from you.

275
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:14,918
''ln the name of faithfulness,
so many sins are committed.''

276
00:38:15,004 --> 00:38:30,305
Ask this to
those who get ruined!

277
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:44,687
Got a blot on life!

278
00:38:47,623 --> 00:38:52,361
Got a blot on life!

279
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,198
l got deceived in love.

280
00:38:57,217 --> 00:39:00,034
l got deceived in love.

281
00:39:00,991 --> 00:39:08,673
Got a blot on life! Oh Goodness!

282
00:39:21,202 --> 00:39:27,861
A small mistake of the youth.

283
00:39:29,837 --> 00:39:33,614
A small mistake of the youth.

284
00:39:34,634 --> 00:39:38,411
Which you will
not even remember.

285
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:48,937
''But with taunts of that mistake,
the world will harass me.''

286
00:39:51,903 --> 00:39:55,680
The gaze will drop in shame!

287
00:39:59,578 --> 00:40:03,356
The gaze will drop in shame!

288
00:40:08,213 --> 00:40:11,990
The gaze will drop in shame!

289
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:17,748
Cause l have
received such a blow today.

290
00:40:17,807 --> 00:40:20,624
l got deceived in love.

291
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:25,423
Got a blot in life.

292
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:49,377
''For love, who was supposed to..''

293
00:40:51,386 --> 00:40:59,932
''For love, who was supposed to
do away with the traditions!''

294
00:41:02,355 --> 00:41:10,517
Who was supposed to
live and die with me!

295
00:41:12,908 --> 00:41:18,158
Handing me over to the storm!

296
00:41:21,127 --> 00:41:25,865
Handing me over to the storm!

297
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:33,507
Handing me over to the storm!

298
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,377
Went and sat far away.

299
00:41:38,397 --> 00:41:46,943
l got deceived in
Iove. Got a blot on life!

300
00:42:00,878 --> 00:42:07,088
Just see my
helpless faithfulness..

301
00:42:09,513 --> 00:42:17,675
Just see my helpless faithfulness
has become a shameful tale.

302
00:42:19,651 --> 00:42:28,197
The souvenir of love has
become the souvenir of a sin.

303
00:42:30,204 --> 00:42:35,902
By giving me a lifelong sorrow.

304
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:42,616
By giving me a lifelong sorrow.

305
00:42:47,473 --> 00:42:51,251
By giving me a lifelong sorrow.

306
00:42:51,311 --> 00:42:56,049
He adorned his bed of happiness!

307
00:42:56,108 --> 00:43:03,694
l got deceived in
Iove. Got a blot on life!

308
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:29,629
''Dear, you? Why are
you standing out?''

309
00:43:29,687 --> 00:43:31,543
''Come inside, give me the bag.''

310
00:44:07,104 --> 00:44:09,920
''Dear, you had gone for
your friend's marriage?''

311
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:28,151
''Marriage? Marriage happened,
auntie.. the marriage took place!''

312
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,027
''But why are you
crying? What happened, dear?''

313
00:44:32,048 --> 00:44:33,904
''Nothing, nothing.''

314
00:44:34,926 --> 00:44:38,703
Something you are hiding from me.
You went in the morning and came.

315
00:44:40,683 --> 00:44:42,539
''What happened?
Tell me, daughter.''

316
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:47,338
''You are under my oath,
tell me what happened!?''

317
00:44:49,317 --> 00:44:52,134
''That man deceived me, auntie.''

318
00:44:52,195 --> 00:44:54,052
Deceived you?

319
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:05,565
l am expecting.

320
00:45:07,546 --> 00:45:09,402
''God, you are expecting?''

321
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:16,120
Who is that rascal? Where
does he stay? What's his name?

322
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:21,876
Come with me. l'll finish him off.
l'll throttle his neck.

323
00:45:22,896 --> 00:45:27,634
''lf you want to throttle, do that to
her, who has put us to such a shame.''

324
00:45:28,653 --> 00:45:30,509
''Get out from my house, get
out at this very moment.''

325
00:45:31,531 --> 00:45:33,387
''Sir!
- Gangu Dai, keep quiet.''

326
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:35,306
This filth can never stay in
my house. You cursed one..

327
00:45:36,328 --> 00:45:41,065
''..instead of this shameful act,
better you had drowned yourself!''

328
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:43,940
Uncle!

329
00:45:44,003 --> 00:45:47,780
l don't want to see your face even.
Get lost.. get out of my house!

330
00:45:52,638 --> 00:45:56,415
There is no place in my
house for a harlot like her!

331
00:47:12,268 --> 00:47:14,124
Let me die! Let me die!

332
00:47:15,146 --> 00:47:21,772
To hide the man's sin? To make him
stronger? Dying for his sins?

333
00:47:21,862 --> 00:47:23,718
This is the only
path left for me.

334
00:47:26,659 --> 00:47:29,476
''Forget it. Man, for his pleasures,
pushes the woman to this path only.''

335
00:47:30,496 --> 00:47:35,234
And many women like you die
carrying the burden of a man's sin.

336
00:47:35,293 --> 00:47:40,991
What can l do? Where can l go?
All the doors are shut on me.

337
00:47:42,009 --> 00:47:45,786
The doors of my shanty are open for
you. l will take you to my place.

338
00:47:46,806 --> 00:47:51,544
l'll wait for the day when the sin
of that sinner steps in this world.

339
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:54,420
And l will go and throw it at
the doors of that despicable man.

340
00:48:05,035 --> 00:48:09,772
''Come dear, come.
Don't cry. Come.''

341
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:27,999
''Come sit, dear, why
are you standing? Sit.''

342
00:48:35,192 --> 00:48:36,600
Falling in love before
marriage is a mistake.

343
00:48:39,573 --> 00:48:47,159
Many girls like you get trapped in
this false love to ruin their lives.

344
00:49:19,868 --> 00:49:23,645
''Low clouds, singing
winds, raise dreams!''

345
00:49:23,706 --> 00:49:27,483
My little heart starts longing!

346
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:36,117
''Low clouds, singing
winds, raise dreams!''

347
00:49:37,137 --> 00:49:40,914
My little heart starts longing!

348
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,615
Fragrant and
enchanting surroundings!

349
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:16,412
Glowing shades of
colors spread everywhere.

350
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:24,087
Fragrant and
enchanting surroundings!

351
00:50:25,107 --> 00:50:28,884
Glowing shades of
colors spread everywhere.

352
00:50:29,904 --> 00:50:32,721
''Today, the sky getting
enthralled, calls us.''

353
00:50:33,742 --> 00:50:37,519
''Low clouds, singing
winds, raise dreams!''

354
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:40,396
My little heart starts longing!

355
00:51:13,077 --> 00:51:24,505
A small boat
floats with the wind.

356
00:51:26,509 --> 00:51:39,857
The boatman sings the song on
the instrument of the river.

357
00:51:42,819 --> 00:51:51,365
''Your body, with each wave..''

358
00:51:54,331 --> 00:52:04,831
..sways in my mischievous eyes.

359
00:52:15,438 --> 00:52:23,024
''My body and soul are for you! This
life, filled with love, is for you!''

360
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:31,688
My body and soul are for you!

361
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:35,525
''This life, filled
with love, is for you!''

362
00:52:36,545 --> 00:52:40,322
ln my eyes are only your images!

363
00:52:40,383 --> 00:52:44,160
''Low clouds, singing
winds, raise dreams!''

364
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:48,957
My little heart starts longing!

365
00:53:50,419 --> 00:53:52,275
''Malti, how very beautiful
the flowers look in your hair.''

366
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:57,074
Really? Shall l ask
you something? - Ask.

367
00:53:59,053 --> 00:54:00,910
''ln the hair of how many
girls, have you put the flowers?''

368
00:54:10,022 --> 00:54:12,391
''Malti, there was a girl in whose
hair l liked the flowers very much.''

369
00:54:13,444 --> 00:54:14,341
Who was she?

370
00:54:17,282 --> 00:54:18,178
''You felt bad, right?''

371
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:22,018
''No, what was her name?''

372
00:54:24,957 --> 00:54:27,774
Her name was Malti.
- Liar!

373
00:54:30,714 --> 00:54:32,570
Shall l give you some
good news? - Why not?

374
00:54:34,551 --> 00:54:37,368
We are going to have a
flowerlike child. - Really?

375
00:55:52,263 --> 00:55:54,119
''Congratulations, for
the grandson, Roopchand!''

376
00:55:54,181 --> 00:55:56,038
''Congratulations to you
too, for the grandson!''

377
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,957
The astrologer said
it would be a girl.

378
00:55:58,019 --> 00:55:58,915
Let the astrologer say anything!

379
00:55:58,978 --> 00:56:00,835
A girl is never born
to our neighbors' even.

380
00:56:01,857 --> 00:56:04,673
We always bring
girls from others only.

381
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:09,470
My entire clan is
full of the moustaches!

382
00:56:10,491 --> 00:56:13,308
My grandfather's
grandfather had a son.

383
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:15,226
My grandfather's
father had a son.

384
00:56:16,183 --> 00:56:19,992
''My grandfather had a son, my father.
My father had a son, that is, l.''

385
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:23,862
l had a son in Mahesh. And
now Mahesh has a son too.

386
00:56:23,923 --> 00:56:27,700
''God willing, it would be a
row full of sons in future too.''

387
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:34,416
''Rai Sahib, such happy
occasions don't come often.''

388
00:56:34,476 --> 00:56:36,333
Why not celebrate?

389
00:56:36,395 --> 00:56:40,172
''Magan, Chagan,
Laxmi, where are you all?''

390
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:44,967
Distribute sweets to neighbors.

391
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,886
Distribute clothes and
money to the poor and destitutes.

392
00:56:46,948 --> 00:56:50,726
This donation will
be in your account.

393
00:56:50,786 --> 00:56:54,563
After that arrange
for a dance program.

394
00:56:54,624 --> 00:56:57,440
The dance arrangements
will be in your account.

395
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:04,157
You are talking about arrangements?
Even the dancers'll be in my account.

396
00:58:12,335 --> 00:58:23,763
''Are you the flower of my love,
or my mistake? Can't say anything.''

397
00:58:23,848 --> 00:58:32,394
''But you pay for someone's
deeds, this too l can't tolerate.''

398
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:47,780
''Are you the flower of my love,
or my mistake? Can't say anything.''

399
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:55,419
''But you pay for someone's
deeds, this too l can't tolerate.''

400
00:59:03,183 --> 00:59:10,769
My disgrace will
grow along with you!

401
00:59:14,696 --> 00:59:22,282
''Listening to the taunts,
my motherhood will be hurt!''

402
00:59:26,209 --> 00:59:33,795
My disgrace will
grow along with you!

403
00:59:34,844 --> 00:59:43,390
''Listening to the taunts,
my motherhood will be hurt!''

404
00:59:44,438 --> 00:59:54,937
All your paths are
full of thorns in life.

405
00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:03,536
''Who will become your
support, in this cruel world?''

406
01:00:07,463 --> 01:00:17,930
''Are you the flower of my love,
or my mistake? Can't say anything.''

407
01:00:18,976 --> 01:00:26,562
''But you pay for someone's
deeds, this too l can't tolerate.''

408
01:00:32,408 --> 01:00:40,954
''lf someone asks, whom
will you call your father?''

409
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:52,499
The world will call
you a discarded sin!

410
01:00:55,433 --> 01:01:03,979
''lf someone asks, whom
will you call your father?''

411
01:01:04,068 --> 01:01:11,686
The world will call
you a discarded sin!

412
01:01:11,743 --> 01:01:23,170
''Your life will be another name of
embarrassment, till you live.''

413
01:01:24,215 --> 01:01:31,801
l will feed you milk but you
will have to swallow the poison!

414
01:01:34,769 --> 01:01:45,236
''Are you the flower of my love,
or my mistake? Can't say anything.''

415
01:01:45,322 --> 01:01:54,829
''But you pay for someone's
deeds, this too l can't tolerate.''

416
01:01:58,754 --> 01:02:00,610
''Meena, just come out, please.''

417
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:19,800
Auntie.. auntie..
what happened to auntie?

418
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,554
Why don't you tell me
what happened to auntie?

419
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,473
''While walking on the
way, she fell down.''

420
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:29,392
And she passed away immediately.

421
01:02:40,008 --> 01:02:45,706
''Now who is there in this world for
me? You left me, auntie.. why?''

422
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:09,687
So you have recognized me?

423
01:03:10,709 --> 01:03:14,486
Now it's of now
use. l am married.

424
01:03:14,546 --> 01:03:15,442
l know it.

425
01:03:15,506 --> 01:03:17,362
Then why did you come?

426
01:03:20,303 --> 01:03:23,119
The gift which you gave
me in the name of love.

427
01:03:23,181 --> 01:03:25,998
''l have come to return it
to you. Here, take it.''

428
01:03:27,018 --> 01:03:27,914
Child?

429
01:03:27,978 --> 01:03:31,755
''Yes child, your child,
yours! The fruit of your sin!''

430
01:03:31,815 --> 01:03:33,672
Even you were
involved in this sin.

431
01:03:34,694 --> 01:03:36,550
You involved me. You
pushed me in the ditch of sin.

432
01:03:37,987 --> 01:03:40,356
You are responsible for
this. Should have thought before.

433
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:42,306
You weren't a kid.
You were matured.

434
01:03:42,369 --> 01:03:46,146
All maturity of a woman doesn't
stand in front of a man's fraud.

435
01:03:46,206 --> 01:03:50,944
A man promises of love
and the woman trusts it.

436
01:03:51,003 --> 01:03:52,860
A man throws a snare of deceit..

437
01:03:52,922 --> 01:03:56,699
..and a woman wears it
considering it to be a garland of love.

438
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,537
You made false promises of love to
me. In the guise of faithfulness..

439
01:04:00,692 --> 01:04:02,454
..you spread the
hand of unfaithfulness.

440
01:04:02,516 --> 01:04:04,373
Why did you hold that hand?

441
01:04:05,394 --> 01:04:09,171
Women never hold a hand.
Her hand is being held.

442
01:04:09,232 --> 01:04:12,049
''You held my hand. It is
your mistake, and your fault.''

443
01:04:14,988 --> 01:04:16,845
Mistake is not only of mine.

444
01:04:16,907 --> 01:04:20,684
''Mistake is of both, why should
only l suffer? Take care of him.''

445
01:04:21,704 --> 01:04:24,521
This is not possible.
l am a respected man.

446
01:04:24,582 --> 01:04:27,399
l have a name in this world.
He will bring bad name to me.

447
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:33,156
Will he bring good name to me? l too
am a respectable person like you.

448
01:04:33,217 --> 01:04:37,954
l too want to walk in this
world with my head held high.

449
01:04:38,014 --> 01:04:40,831
''You walk with your head held high or
not, but l've no relation with him.''

450
01:04:40,892 --> 01:04:42,749
You have no relation? Even l
have nothing to do with him.

451
01:04:42,811 --> 01:04:44,667
''Fine then, throw him away.''

452
01:04:45,689 --> 01:04:48,506
Throw him away? Where to throw?

453
01:04:48,567 --> 01:04:50,424
Wherever you want. l
don't know anything.

454
01:04:51,446 --> 01:04:54,262
l will not throw him away. l
will hang him in your neck.

455
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:56,180
l will scream in front of the whole
world that this is Mahesh's child.

456
01:04:56,243 --> 01:04:58,099
That Mahesh is his father.

457
01:04:59,121 --> 01:05:00,977
Who will believe?
What proof do you have?

458
01:05:47,091 --> 01:05:49,908
l have no relation with this child.
l have nothing to do with him.

459
01:05:49,969 --> 01:05:52,786
''l am a respected person, he
will bring bad name to me.''

460
01:05:52,847 --> 01:05:57,585
''Will he bring good name to me? l'll
scream and tell, he's Mahesh's child.''

461
01:05:58,604 --> 01:06:01,420
Who will believe?
What proof do you have?

462
01:06:05,735 --> 01:06:10,985
Throw him away! Throw
him away! Throw him away!

463
01:06:12,995 --> 01:06:17,732
Why are you crying?
Why don't you die!

464
01:07:28,787 --> 01:07:33,525
Ya Allah! The provider
has left him to die!

465
01:07:33,584 --> 01:07:37,361
And the killer is
giving him protection!

466
01:07:37,422 --> 01:07:39,278
''What wonders you show, O Lord!''

467
01:07:47,975 --> 01:07:51,752
Whose child is
this? Is there anybody?

468
01:07:52,772 --> 01:07:56,549
ls there somebody
to take this child?

469
01:09:03,768 --> 01:09:05,624
Where is my child?
Where is he? Munna..

470
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:50,717
''Greetings, Abdul uncle.
- Greetings, how are you?''

471
01:09:56,535 --> 01:10:00,312
''Come, Abdul uncle. Come.
- Greetings, Punditji.''

472
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:04,148
Give him to me.

473
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:05,106
''Sit uncle, sit.''

474
01:10:08,048 --> 01:10:10,864
You have done an
act of great virtue!

475
01:10:11,885 --> 01:10:13,742
Allah will definitely
reward you for this virtue.

476
01:10:13,804 --> 01:10:18,541
You've done an act of great virtue.
Praise to you. You are like a God.

477
01:10:26,276 --> 01:10:27,172
Such a flower like
child. Don't know whose he is.

478
01:10:30,114 --> 01:10:33,891
Must be of some unmarried or
widowed woman. Who else can throw?

479
01:10:34,911 --> 01:10:39,648
Whomsoever he is. He
is a child after all.

480
01:10:41,627 --> 01:10:44,443
''Ramzani, O Ramzani!
- Uncle!?''

481
01:10:45,464 --> 01:10:48,281
You have 6-l children.
One more will be fine.

482
01:10:48,342 --> 01:10:50,199
Even he will grow
up along with them.

483
01:10:51,221 --> 01:10:54,037
''Oh! Uncle, don't know
about his caste and religion.''

484
01:10:54,099 --> 01:10:56,916
How can l keep him in my house?

485
01:11:00,815 --> 01:11:02,671
''Sister Jamuna, since years you
have been craving for a child.''

486
01:11:02,733 --> 01:11:06,511
''Going to pilgrimages,
doing penances, keeping fasts!''

487
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:10,347
''God has sent this child to you,
sitting at home only. Take him.''

488
01:11:12,327 --> 01:11:14,184
''lnstead of such a
child, better not have any.''

489
01:11:14,246 --> 01:11:15,142
Don't know whose he is.

490
01:11:15,206 --> 01:11:18,022
Who knows whether he
is a Hindu or Muslim?

491
01:11:18,084 --> 01:11:19,940
Punditji he can
also be a Christian.

492
01:11:20,003 --> 01:11:25,700
''Everybody loves his own religion.
C'mon, get along with our works.''

493
01:11:37,272 --> 01:11:42,009
''lf they love their
religion, l love this child!''

494
01:11:43,988 --> 01:11:47,765
''Don't cry, son, let
them go. l am here.''

495
01:11:47,825 --> 01:11:50,642
''By the grace of God, l
have the strength in me.''

496
01:11:53,582 --> 01:11:55,438
''l will raise
you, son, come home.''

497

''Nothing, just that l am
not going to the court today.''

548
01:25:02,208 --> 01:25:04,065
l have typed that letter.

549
01:25:21,396 --> 01:25:24,213
''Meena Devi, please come here.''

550
01:25:28,112 --> 01:25:29,969
Did l make mistake again?

551
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:34,768
''No, nothing of that sort. l want
to say something else. Please sit.''

552
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:41,482
''See, l am a person of a
clear heart and consciousness.''

553
01:25:41,544 --> 01:25:43,400
''lf l say something,
please don't feel bad..''

554
01:25:43,463 --> 01:25:46,279
..and in clear
terms say yes or no.

555
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:50,118
Yes or no? l didn't
understand anything.

556
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:53,956
''Well, the thing
is that.. l mean..''

557
01:25:54,975 --> 01:26:00,673
''See, don't ask about my past,
l want to forget everything.''

558
01:26:01,147 --> 01:26:04,476
l also want you to
forget everything.

559
01:26:04,569 --> 01:26:06,426
l don't want to
ask about your past.

''But, but you don't know..''

l can understand that
you were ditched in love.

563
01:26:17,042 --> 01:26:18,898
Even l was ditched.

564
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:23,698
And l also know that love
before marriage is just a play.

565

That's why l want to marry you
before falling in love with you.

566
01:26:29,514 --> 01:26:32,331
''lf you don't like me, say it
clearly. It won't hurt me.''

567
01:26:32,392 --> 01:26:34,249
No.. that's not the case.

568
01:26:34,311 --> 01:26:36,135
''Then, l don't want to
listen to anything else, Meena.''

569
01:28:10,474 --> 01:28:15,212
How to express the
feelings of my heart?

570
01:28:15,303 --> 01:28:19,080
How to express the
feelings of my heart?

571
01:28:20,068 --> 01:28:28,647
Heartless beloved took happiness
away and left sorrows behind!

572
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:31,551

585
01:30:04,643 --> 01:30:13,222
Love is a lie! And
so is the beloved!

586
01:30:20,984 --> 01:30:25,722
Love is a lie! And
so is the beloved!

587

Got hurt and the
dreams were shattered!

588

''Here, take some more.''

598
01:32:44,894 --> 01:32:46,718
No.. enough uncle.

599
01:32:46,782 --> 01:32:49,630
What enough? Why are you eating
like a bird? Eat like a lion!

600
01:32:53,529 --> 01:32:55,353
''But keep for
yourself also, uncle.''

holiday tomorrow, right?''

603
01:33:15,564 --> 01:33:18,412
''Yes uncle, but l won't
study in that school now.''

604
01:33:18,474 --> 01:33:19,370
Why son?

605
01:33:19,848 --> 01:33:24,139
''That Pundit's son says, l
have no father or mother.''

606
01:33:24,230 --> 01:33:27,047
l told Abdul uncle is my father.

607
01:33:28,068 --> 01:33:30,884
So that Mulla's son told me that
Abdul uncle is not your father.

608
01:33:30,946 --> 01:33:33,730
You are a bastard. A bastard!

609
01:33:34,752 --> 01:33:37,600
''Uncle, what is a bastard?''

01:33:37,662 --> 01:33:39,518
Those who are
idlers and freeloaders!

611
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:41,404
Both the Pundit and
Mulla are such freeloaders.

612
01:33:43,418 --> 01:33:48,155
Don't play with such loafers. l'll
get you admitted to another school.

613
01:33:48,215 --> 01:33:50,071
''Go, clean up yourself.''

614
01:34:08,362 --> 01:34:10,186
You apply powder everyday.

615
01:34:10,281 --> 01:34:13,065
''Today, l too will
apply the powder.''

616
01:34:16,038 --> 01:34:17,894
''See, you look like a monkey.''

617

''Mummy, you are cussing daddy?''

618
01:34:19,875 --> 01:34:22,659
Whose son a monkey is?

619
01:34:22,722 --> 01:34:26,530
Shall l tell? This
monkey is my son.

620
01:34:31,292 --> 01:34:33,212
''Malti, give me my coat.

And l am ready

624
01:35:05,926 --> 01:35:07,750
''My dear monkey, this
gun won't do in school.''

''Okay boss, let's go.
- Come.''

01:38:18,766 --> 01:38:20,590
l think him to be a human being.

668
01:38:21,644 --> 01:38:23,500
So you don't know
anything about his parents?

669
01:38:23,531 --> 01:38:27,340
All that l know is that he
is the son of some devil.

670
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,224
And every human
being is his father.

671
01:38:29,319 --> 01:38:31,143
l respect your feelings.

672
01:38:32,166 --> 01:38:34,054
Then write my name in
place of the father's name

673
01:38:34,084 --> 01:38:35,973
Tell me.

674
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:40,740
''Abdul Rashid. Since the last
8 years, l am raising him up.''

675
01:39:03,858 --> 01:39:06,674
''Mohan, have you heard?
Roshan has no clue of his parents.''

676
01:39:06,736 --> 01:39:08,560
What? No clue of his parents?

677
01:39:08,655 --> 01:39:11,471
What parents! His caste and
religion are also not known.

678
01:39:11,501 --> 01:39:13,389
''So, is Roshan a bastard?
- Yes.''

679
01:39:30,689 --> 01:39:32,577
''No, not here, Miyan Roshan Ali.''

680
01:39:35,518 --> 01:39:37,342
''No, not here, Roshan Lal.''

681
01:39:39,324 --> 01:39:41,212
''No, not here, Mr. Roshan.''

682
01:39:48,918 --> 01:39:51,766
''Roshan, you come here. Near me.''

683
01:39:53,746 --> 01:39:55,570
''No, this is my place. l
won't allow him to sit here.''

684
01:39:55,665 --> 01:39:57,489
He will sit here only.

685
01:39:57,584 --> 01:39:59,440
He can't sit here.

686
01:39:59,471 --> 01:40:01,359
''You will stop him?
- Yes, l will stop him.''

687
01:40:01,422 --> 01:40:03,278
lf you raise your
hand l will break it up.

688
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:05,164
Sir has come. Sir has come.

689
01:40:19,618 --> 01:40:24,356
''Dear, it's not a hand but
a treasure of happiness!''

690
01:40:24,447 --> 01:40:26,271
God has given me
all the happiness.

691
01:40:26,366 --> 01:40:29,183
Just one sorrow.
There is no child.

692
01:40:32,122 --> 01:40:35,867
Surprising! There is a clear line
on your palms for one offspring.

693
01:40:38,806 --> 01:40:40,695
Only one child?

694
01:40:41,716 --> 01:40:44,501
''Yes, there is a line
for only one child.''

695
01:40:45,554 --> 01:40:47,410
''Only one is enough for
us, isn't it, Meena?''

696
01:40:47,441 --> 01:40:49,329
Just see when this
auspicious moment will arrive!

697
01:40:50,351 --> 01:40:52,175
Till now it should have arrived.

698
01:40:52,270 --> 01:40:54,094
Hand is full and
the lap is empty!?

699
01:40:55,148 --> 01:40:56,011
This is very worrisome.

700
01:40:56,076 --> 01:40:58,924
''Nothing to worry. Dear, you
will be a mother very soon.''

701
01:40:58,986 --> 01:41:01,770
''How soon, this you tell to
her. l will take you leave.''

702
01:41:06,629 --> 01:41:10,438
Please see it properly. Is
there a line for only one child?

703
01:41:11,458 --> 01:41:14,242
''Yes, there is a line
for only one child.''

704
01:41:16,223 --> 01:41:20,032
Perhaps that happiness is not
in my destiny. - It sure is.

705
01:41:20,092 --> 01:41:21,916
You son will be very fortunate!

706
01:41:31,605 --> 01:41:36,343
''Come Roshan, come.
This is my home.''

707
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:41,104
''Ramesh, your house is superb!''

708
01:41:45,005 --> 01:41:46,893
''Who is he, Ramesh?''

709
01:41:46,956 --> 01:41:49,740
He is my maternal grandfather
and he is my paternal grandfather.

710
01:41:49,834 --> 01:41:51,658
And now they both are gone!

711
01:41:54,599 --> 01:41:56,487
He is my daddy.

712
01:41:56,550 --> 01:41:58,406
You daddy is very nice.

713
01:41:58,468 --> 01:42:02,213
My mother is also very
nice. She is my mummy.

714
01:42:05,152 --> 01:42:07,041
''You have come, dear Ramesh!''

715
01:42:08,926 --> 01:42:09,885
''Who is he, with you?''

716
01:42:09,981 --> 01:42:13,758
''Mummy, he is my classmate.
He is my best friend. - Is it?''

717
01:42:16,697 --> 01:42:18,521
''What is your name, dear?''

718
01:42:19,191 --> 01:42:20,440
Roshan.
- Nice name.

719
01:42:21,494 --> 01:42:23,350
You will definitely bring
glory to your parents' name.

720
01:42:23,381 --> 01:42:26,230
''Mummy, even l will bring
glory to my parents' name.''

721
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:29,074
''Okay, mummy, we are
both going out to play.''

722
01:42:29,169 --> 01:42:32,946
''No son, first you eat
and then go to play.''

723
01:42:32,975 --> 01:42:35,824
''Go. You both go and clean
yourselves. - Come, Roshan.''

724
01:43:10,392 --> 01:43:12,280
Sit. Sit!

725
01:43:22,896 --> 01:43:27,600
''Here, have some milk.''

726
01:43:27,693 --> 01:43:29,516
l don't feel like drinking milk.

727
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:31,468
''No son, one
shouldn't do like that.''

728
01:43:32,490 --> 01:43:35,274
''Listen, pick up the glass
and l will count till ten.''

729
01:43:35,368 --> 01:43:37,192
One who finishes it
first will get an apple.

730
01:43:37,287 --> 01:43:40,103
''Understood? C'mon,
pick up the glass.''

731
01:43:43,458 --> 01:43:50,630
''One, two, three,
four, five, six..''

732
01:43:50,687 --> 01:43:53,535
''..seven, eight, nine and ten.''

733
01:43:53,596 --> 01:43:55,420
l am first.

734
01:43:56,475 --> 01:43:57,338
Good. Both together.

735
01:44:05,013 --> 01:44:06,933
And this is your reward!

736
01:44:10,866 --> 01:44:12,722
''Roshan son, you can come
here to play, everyday.''

737
01:44:12,784 --> 01:44:14,608
''Yes mummy, he
will come everyday.''

738
01:44:19,916 --> 01:44:20,844
Ramesh son!

739
01:44:29,063 --> 01:44:30,951
When did you come?
- Just now.

740
01:44:32,932 --> 01:44:34,756
Today l will take my
son for an outing.

741
01:44:34,851 --> 01:44:35,714
Take him too.

742
01:44:38,657 --> 01:44:40,545
''Ramesh, who is he?''

743
01:44:41,566 --> 01:44:44,351
''He is my friend, my best friend.''

744
01:44:44,445 --> 01:44:45,308
Greetings!

745
01:44:49,242 --> 01:44:52,026
He is not worthy
to be your friend.

746
01:44:52,216 --> 01:44:54,904
''Friendship with such
boys is not good, son.''

747
01:44:57,845 --> 01:44:59,733
Why? What's the matter?

748
01:44:59,795 --> 01:45:01,619
''Not a matter, Malti. A flaw!''

749
01:45:02,673 --> 01:45:03,537
lt is a blemish! It is immoral!

750
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:07,409
''No daddy, he is very
nice. He has no bad habits''

751
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:10,287
''No my son, you don't know.
He is a burden on earth.''

752
01:45:10,348 --> 01:45:12,172
A living sin.

753
01:45:13,227 --> 01:45:16,043
''You belong to a lineage, son.
While his lineage is not known.''

754
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,849
You have respect.
He has disgrace.

755
01:45:19,942 --> 01:45:23,687
No one knows of his mother or father!
He is an illegitimate child.

756
01:45:23,748 --> 01:45:26,597
Don't play with him.
Don't bring him with you.

757
01:45:27,618 --> 01:45:29,474
Dare if you
bring him home again.

758
01:45:39,130 --> 01:45:39,994
''Wait, Roshan.''

759
01:46:10,791 --> 01:46:14,568
''Uncle.
- You have come, son.''

760
01:46:14,597 --> 01:46:17,445
Why are you standing
there? Come inside.

761
01:46:17,506 --> 01:46:20,291
''First tell me, who is my
mother? Who is my father?''

762
01:46:20,385 --> 01:46:22,208
''Myself, son.
- No.''

763
01:46:23,231 --> 01:46:26,080
''No, you aren't my father.
Tell me who my father is!''

764
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:30,845
''l am your father,
dear. Who has misled you?''

765
01:46:30,906 --> 01:46:36,636
You only misled me. You only
lied to me. You aren't my father.

766
01:46:37,654 --> 01:46:42,391
You are Abdul uncle. You
know of everything. Everything.

767
01:46:43,379 --> 01:46:48,116
''Tell me, who my
parents are? Whose son l am?''

768
01:46:48,207 --> 01:46:50,031
Where do l belong? Who am l?

769
01:46:52,973 --> 01:46:56,750
You are among those who are
eliminated as soon as they're born.

770
01:46:57,801 --> 01:47:03,499
''Those who are put to sleep, not in
a cradle but in the hostile sea.''

771
01:47:04,517 --> 01:47:06,341
Those who don't get
the light of the house..

772
01:47:06,436 --> 01:47:10,180
''..but deep darkness of the well, or
the horrific desolation of forests.''

773
01:47:12,161 --> 01:47:16,898
''Those who get the lap of not their
parents, but the lap of death!''

774
01:47:16,989 --> 01:47:19,773
And if those
unfortunate ones remain alive..

775
01:47:19,836 --> 01:47:22,684
..the world kicks
and butts at them..

776
01:47:22,746 --> 01:47:24,602
..and they grow up amidst the
ridicule and abuses of the world.

777
01:47:24,664 --> 01:47:29,369
''But you only tell me, uncle,
till when will l face the abuses?''

778
01:47:31,316 --> 01:47:33,205
Till when will l
live in such a manner?

779
01:47:39,024 --> 01:47:43,793
''Don't worry, son. Whatever the
world may say or understand.''

780
01:47:45,771 --> 01:47:47,595
l will take you to be my son.

781
01:47:48,618 --> 01:47:52,427
''Swear God, you are my son.''

782
01:47:52,487 --> 01:47:56,232
My nice uncle! Uncle!

783
01:47:56,325 --> 01:47:59,141
My son!
- Uncle. My nice uncle.

784
01:48:18,359 --> 01:48:21,208
''Roshan, come sit in my car.''

785
01:48:26,994 --> 01:48:30,803
''Driver, you take the car
back. l will go walking.''

786
01:48:34,701 --> 01:48:37,517
''Roshan, are you angry at me?''

787
01:48:39,913 --> 01:48:42,283
''Yesterday, after you had
Ieft, mummy scolded daddy a lot.''

788
01:48:43,335 --> 01:48:44,199
Even l got angry.

789
01:48:44,295 --> 01:48:46,118
Your daddy is right.

790
01:48:47,141 --> 01:48:50,950
''l am blemished! l am
a living sin, Ramesh.''

791
01:48:51,010 --> 01:48:53,795
''Even my parents are
not known, Ramesh.''

792
01:48:53,889 --> 01:48:55,712
There is nobody of mine in
this world. No one to call my own.

793
01:48:55,776 --> 01:48:58,624
''There is. l am yours.
You are my brother, Roshan''

794
01:48:59,645 --> 01:49:02,429
Neither do l've a brother
now am l a brother to anyone.

795
01:49:03,483 --> 01:49:07,260
''l am all alone. For God's sake,
you too don't meet me. Don't.''

796
01:49:07,289 --> 01:49:09,177
l will meet you.
Most definitely.

797
01:49:10,198 --> 01:49:12,022
Let me see who stops me.

798
01:49:12,117 --> 01:49:14,901
Come Roshan. Come on.

799
01:49:22,671 --> 01:49:25,487
Just see a pair of horse
and a donkey is arriving!

800
01:49:25,517 --> 01:49:27,405
One with a great father!
Another without any father!

801
01:49:30,346 --> 01:49:32,170
Say it again! Who
is without a father?

802
01:49:32,265 --> 01:49:34,088
lt's you! You bastard!

803
01:49:38,021 --> 01:49:40,805
l will take care of him.
- Let it be.

804
01:49:40,899 --> 01:49:42,723
l alone can handle him.

805
01:49:58,168 --> 01:49:59,992
''Let go of him,
brother, let go of him.''

806
01:50:00,087 --> 01:50:01,911
''Get aside, Ramesh.''

807
01:50:03,893 --> 01:50:07,702
Sir has come.. sir has come.

808
01:50:09,681 --> 01:50:12,465
Tell me.. say..
who is a bastard?

809
01:50:12,528 --> 01:50:14,416
''Roshan, sir will be angry.''

810
01:50:14,447 --> 01:50:16,335
l don't care for
any sir. Understood?

811
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,410
Let's see what comes out.

812
01:50:42,269 --> 01:50:44,157
Are only papers stuffed inside?

813
01:50:46,138 --> 01:50:48,923
Shucks!
- Only one rupee?

814
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:51,800
Which pauper were you following?

815
01:50:51,863 --> 01:50:53,751
He looked like a gentleman.

816
01:50:53,814 --> 01:50:55,670
Gentlemen of today don't
have money in their pockets..

817
01:50:55,828 --> 01:50:57,556
..but only hunger and
unemployment. Understood?

818
01:50:58,611 --> 01:51:00,434
Go behind those
whose pockets are full.

819
01:51:01,457 --> 01:51:03,345
''Just see, full 500.''

820
01:51:04,367 --> 01:51:06,191
''Great, boss.
- Move your hand.''

821
01:51:06,286 --> 01:51:09,070
My tip? - l taught you the
work and you will take the tip!?

822
01:51:09,132 --> 01:51:10,028
''This won't do, boss.
- Take.''

823
01:51:10,092 --> 01:51:12,940
You too will
remember me. Take this.

824
01:51:13,002 --> 01:51:14,858
''And you too take, my dear.''

825
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:18,664
''Let it come. Mine was, l dug a
mountain and came out a molehill.''

826
01:51:18,726 --> 01:51:19,622
''Hey, someone is sitting there.''

827
01:51:24,514 --> 01:51:27,299
''Don't worry, boss. He looks
like he has bunked school.''

828
01:51:27,393 --> 01:51:31,170
Then he will come to our
school. Just give it a try.

829
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:33,087
His innocent face will
be of immense use to us.

830
01:51:34,044 --> 01:51:34,973
''As your order, sir! O
Dishonesty, bless me!''

831
01:51:58,062 --> 01:51:59,950
Hey get up from here.

832
01:52:01,931 --> 01:52:03,755
What are you staring at?
Didn't l ask you to get up?

833
01:52:04,809 --> 01:52:06,633
Why? l won't get up.

834
01:52:06,696 --> 01:52:09,545
''Won't get up?
- Yes, l won't get up.''

835
01:52:09,575 --> 01:52:10,502
You won't get up?

836
01:52:11,525 --> 01:52:13,349
Do you think this bench belongs to
your father? Shall l give you a few?

837
01:52:13,444 --> 01:52:15,268
''Hey, what are you
doing? Let go of him.''

838
01:52:15,363 --> 01:52:17,186
Who are you to speak in
between? - Your father.

839
01:52:17,250 --> 01:52:19,138
Bullying a child?
Get lost from here.

840
01:52:23,038 --> 01:52:25,822
l will deal with you too!

841
01:52:25,884 --> 01:52:27,772
Go.. get lost.
Seen many like you!

842
01:52:28,730 --> 01:52:30,619
''lf ever you say anything to this
kid, l will break your teeth!''

843
01:52:32,632 --> 01:52:34,936
''What is your name, dear?
- Roshan.''

844
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:36,374
Good. Going to school?

845
01:52:36,438 --> 01:52:39,286
''No, coming. l will never
go to school now. - Why?''

846
01:52:39,348 --> 01:52:42,132
l have stopped my
studies from today.

847
01:52:42,226 --> 01:52:45,010
Very nice child.
Uncle Chhagan has said..

848
01:52:45,072 --> 01:52:47,921
''..if you study,
you will get spoilt!''

849
01:52:47,951 --> 01:52:49,839
''And if you play, you
will become a king!''

850
01:52:50,860 --> 01:52:52,684
''Dear, l will teach you
such tricks to earn..''

851
01:52:52,779 --> 01:52:54,603
..that you will put good educated
people to shame. - Is it?

852
01:52:55,626 --> 01:52:57,514
''Yes, all the time your
pockets will be filled..''

853
01:52:57,545 --> 01:52:59,433
..just see this.. with
such bundle of notes.

854
01:53:01,414 --> 01:53:03,238
But l don't know any work.

855
01:53:03,333 --> 01:53:05,156
''You will learn, don't you worry.''

856
01:53:05,220 --> 01:53:06,628
l will teach it
to you in seconds.

857
01:53:06,659 --> 01:53:09,028
''Pick up your bag. This too
may come to use, sometime.''

858
01:53:09,089 --> 01:53:10,913
Let's have some tea on this!

859
01:53:20,602 --> 01:53:23,386
lt is dusk and
Roshan hasn't come as yet.

860
01:53:30,196 --> 01:53:32,020
''Got very late today, son?''

861
01:53:32,115 --> 01:53:33,938
Now l will be late everyday.

862
01:53:34,002 --> 01:53:36,850
Even l may be out
for a couple of days.

863
01:53:36,912 --> 01:53:38,768
''How come, my son?''

864
01:53:38,830 --> 01:53:41,615
l have taken an admission in
the training class in school.

865
01:53:41,709 --> 01:53:44,525
''They teach ways to
earn money in it, uncle.''

866
01:53:46,506 --> 01:53:48,362
Forget the earning
now. You are still small.

867
01:53:48,808 --> 01:53:51,209
''May God bring that day soon,
when after completing your..''

868
01:53:51,303 --> 01:53:53,126
''..education, you start
earning and stand on your own.''

869
01:53:53,190 --> 01:53:57,959
''Those days won't come,
uncle. They have come, now.''

870
01:54:17,206 --> 01:54:19,030
''Madan, Ramesh has come.''

871
01:54:19,125 --> 01:54:20,949
But he hasn't come.

872
01:54:21,012 --> 01:54:22,900
He will come some
or the other day.

873
01:54:22,931 --> 01:54:25,780
''l will teach him such a lesson,
that he will also remember it.''

874
01:54:36,394 --> 01:54:39,179
We have to live for ourselves!

875
01:54:39,273 --> 01:54:41,096
We have to die for ourselves!

876
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:43,048
''Whatever happens, let it happen!''

877
01:54:43,079 --> 01:54:44,967
What do we have to do with it!

878
01:54:45,988 --> 01:54:49,733
We have to live for ourselves!
We have to die for ourselves!

879
01:54:49,794 --> 01:54:53,603
''Whatever happens, let it happen!
What do we have to do with it!''

880
01:55:02,267 --> 01:55:04,155
Those who care for the world..

881
01:55:04,217 --> 01:55:06,041
..let them suffer the world.

882
01:55:06,136 --> 01:55:07,960
We will dance on the streets..

883
01:55:08,055 --> 01:55:09,878
..and play on the footpaths.

884
01:55:12,852 --> 01:55:14,708
Those who care for the world..

885
01:55:14,770 --> 01:55:16,594
..let them suffer the world.

886
01:55:16,689 --> 01:55:18,513
We will dance on the streets..

887
01:55:18,576 --> 01:55:20,464
..and play on the footpaths.

888
01:55:20,495 --> 01:55:24,304
Let them sigh who want to sigh!

889
01:55:24,364 --> 01:55:26,188
We have to live for ourselves!

890
01:55:26,283 --> 01:55:28,107
We have to die for ourselves!

891
01:55:28,170 --> 01:55:30,058
''Let whatever happens, happen.''

892
01:55:30,089 --> 01:55:31,977
What do we have to do with it!

893
01:55:32,999 --> 01:55:34,823
We have to live for ourselves!

894
01:55:34,918 --> 01:55:36,742
We have to die for ourselves!

895
01:55:36,837 --> 01:55:38,660
''Whatever happens, let it happen!''

896
01:55:38,724 --> 01:55:40,612
What do we have to do with it!

897
01:55:49,277 --> 01:55:51,165
When we begged for love..

898
01:55:51,228 --> 01:55:53,084
..people butted us.

899
01:55:53,146 --> 01:55:54,970
Finally we too have..

900
01:55:55,065 --> 01:55:56,889
..kicked the world
with the tip of our shoe!

901
01:55:58,871 --> 01:56:00,759
When we begged for love..

902
01:56:00,822 --> 01:56:02,678
..people butted us.

903
01:56:03,700 --> 01:56:05,524
Finally we too have..

904
01:56:05,619 --> 01:56:07,442
..kicked the world
with the tip of our shoe!

905
01:56:07,506 --> 01:56:09,394
The life had to pass somehow.

906
01:56:09,425 --> 01:56:11,313
lt will pass this way too!

907
01:56:11,375 --> 01:56:13,199
We have to live for ourselves!

908
01:56:13,294 --> 01:56:15,118
We have to die for ourselves!

909
01:56:15,213 --> 01:56:17,036
''Whatever happens, let it happen!''

910
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:18,988
What do we have to do with it!

911
01:56:19,019 --> 01:56:20,907
We have to live for ourselves!

912
01:56:20,969 --> 01:56:23,274
We have to die for ourselves!

913
01:56:23,847 --> 01:56:25,671
''Whatever happens, let it happen!''

914
01:56:25,734 --> 01:56:27,622
What do we have to do with it!

915
01:56:35,616 --> 01:56:37,184
Worriless like us..

916
01:56:37,247 --> 01:56:40,096
..aren't any
others in this world!

917
01:56:40,157 --> 01:56:41,981
While the world is
drowning in sorrows!

918
01:56:42,076 --> 01:56:43,900
We are drowned in our joys!

919
01:56:43,995 --> 01:56:45,818
''What did you
understand, brother?''

920
01:56:45,882 --> 01:56:47,770
Worriless like us..

921
01:56:47,801 --> 01:56:49,689
..aren't any
others in this world!

922
01:56:49,751 --> 01:56:51,575
While the world is
drowning in sorrows!

923
01:56:51,670 --> 01:56:53,494
We are drowned in our joys!

924
01:56:53,589 --> 01:56:58,326
We live and die
as per our wishes!

925
01:56:58,386 --> 01:57:00,209
We have to live for ourselves!

926
01:57:00,304 --> 01:57:02,128
We have to die for ourselves!

927
01:57:02,223 --> 01:57:04,047
''Whatever happens, let it happen!''

928
01:57:04,110 --> 01:57:05,998
What do we have to do with it!

929
01:57:06,029 --> 01:57:07,917
We have to live for ourselves!

930
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:09,803
We have to die for ourselves!

931
01:57:09,898 --> 01:57:11,722
''Whatever happens, let it happen!''

932
01:57:11,817 --> 01:57:14,601
What do we have to do with it!

933
01:57:30,046 --> 01:57:30,909
''Come son, come.''

934
01:57:32,892 --> 01:57:33,788
Will you take these books?

935
01:57:34,811 --> 01:57:35,739
Brand new.

936
01:57:35,771 --> 01:57:38,139
''Yes, yes, but you will get
the price of old books only.''

937
01:57:38,201 --> 01:57:42,426
Why? They are totally
new. Not even one month old.

938
01:57:42,486 --> 01:57:44,374
Everything that is new
becomes old after just one hour.

939
01:57:44,405 --> 01:57:47,254
l will give you half the
rate. Just show me the books.

940
01:57:53,999 --> 01:57:55,887
Are you buying any new book?

941
01:57:55,950 --> 01:57:58,734
''No, l am selling them.
- Why?''

942
01:57:58,828 --> 01:58:01,612
Because l have
started my new business

943
01:58:01,674 --> 01:58:03,562
''Which type of business, friend?''

944
01:58:03,593 --> 01:58:07,370
Just.. that items from here
to there and there to here.

945
01:58:07,462 --> 01:58:10,247
ltems from here to
there and there to here.

946
01:58:10,341 --> 01:58:13,157
l didn't understand anything.

947
01:58:13,187 --> 01:58:15,075
''l lost while
gambling, yesterday, pal.''

948
01:58:15,138 --> 01:58:19,843
''Lost in gambling? Roshan,
you have started to gamble!?''

949
01:58:19,935 --> 01:58:22,751
What else to do? Studying
is only for decent people.

950
01:58:22,781 --> 01:58:24,669
Take them. Give me
half rates only.

951
01:58:24,732 --> 01:58:28,476
''Roshan, don't be mad. l
won't let you sell these books.''

952
01:58:28,569 --> 01:58:30,393
''Come, let's go to
school. Come, c'mon.''

953
01:58:31,416 --> 01:58:34,264
What use is going to school?
No matter how much l study..

954
01:58:34,326 --> 01:58:37,110
..but l will be
called a bastard only.

955
01:58:37,204 --> 01:58:40,948
''No Roshan, education
removes all evils.''

956
01:58:41,010 --> 01:58:42,898
''Roshan, Valmiki was a dacoit.''

957
01:58:42,929 --> 01:58:46,706
But because of knowledge
he became such a great sage.

958
01:58:46,798 --> 01:58:49,582
You have to become a
good person. A good boy.

959
01:58:49,644 --> 01:58:52,493
You only become a good boy.
You only become a big person.

960
01:58:52,523 --> 01:58:54,411
What do l have to do? Who is
there in this world for me?

961
01:58:54,473 --> 01:58:56,297
l don't want to study.

962
01:58:56,392 --> 01:58:58,216
''lf you don't want to study,
then even l don't want to study.''

963
01:58:58,311 --> 01:58:59,174
Sell off my books too.

964
01:59:00,198 --> 01:59:02,086
Even l will gamble
and loaf around.

965
01:59:02,117 --> 01:59:04,005
l too will become a hooligan.

966
01:59:07,905 --> 01:59:11,682
''Ramesh, wait, take your books.''

967
01:59:11,711 --> 01:59:13,599
Even l am coming to the school.

968
01:59:13,661 --> 01:59:17,406
Really?
- Yes. - Come.

969
01:59:45,321 --> 01:59:47,145
''Sit down, boys.''

970
01:59:49,127 --> 01:59:51,015
''What happened, Madan?''

971
01:59:52,037 --> 01:59:52,901
''Sir, Roshan is back.''

972
01:59:56,802 --> 01:59:57,698
Why did you hit him?

973
01:59:57,762 --> 01:59:59,650
''Sir, he cussed me.''

974
01:59:59,681 --> 02:00:01,569
Why didn't you tell
me? You scoundrel!

975
02:00:01,631 --> 02:00:03,455
Where were you for 8 days?

976
02:00:03,550 --> 02:00:05,374
''Sir, he was sick.
- You, keep quiet!''

977
02:00:05,469 --> 02:00:08,285
''Tomorrow, get a
Ietter from your uncle.''

978
02:00:31,372 --> 02:00:35,117
''Sir, Roshan tore my book.''

979
02:00:35,178 --> 02:00:39,948
''Roshan, come here.''

980
02:00:41,926 --> 02:00:43,750
Why did you tear his book?

981
02:00:43,813 --> 02:00:45,669
''l didn't tear his book, sir.''

982
02:00:45,732 --> 02:00:47,620
''Sir, Roshan
didn't tear his book.''

983
02:00:47,651 --> 02:00:49,539
''Ask Dinesh, sir.''

984
02:00:49,601 --> 02:00:51,425
''Yes, sir, he tore
it in front of me.''

985
02:00:52,479 --> 02:00:53,343
''No sir, this is all a lie.''

986
02:00:53,407 --> 02:00:55,263
You won't give up this way.

987
02:00:55,326 --> 02:00:58,174
Go and stand on your
bench for the whole week.

988
02:01:07,830 --> 02:01:10,614
''Let him go. Ramesh,
sit in your place.''

989
02:01:10,708 --> 02:01:13,492
What are all of you
watching? Open your books.

990
02:01:16,433 --> 02:01:18,321
What was yesterday's lesson?

991
02:01:37,571 --> 02:01:40,355
''Roshan, what are
you doing over here?''

992
02:01:40,449 --> 02:01:42,273
l will take revenge from Madan.

993
02:01:42,336 --> 02:01:45,185
''You should not do like
that, Roshan. - l will do it.''

994
02:01:45,215 --> 02:01:47,103
''This isn't a work of
decent guys, Roshan.''

995
02:01:47,165 --> 02:01:48,989
Who says that l am decent?

996
02:01:50,043 --> 02:01:51,867
l am a goon! Confirmed goon!

997
02:01:58,678 --> 02:02:01,462
There he is going. Where
will he escape from me?

998
02:02:01,524 --> 02:02:03,413
l will finish him off!

999
02:02:03,443 --> 02:02:05,331
''No Roshan, l won't let you go.''

1000
02:02:05,394 --> 02:02:07,217
''Don't become my enemy, Ramesh.''

1001
02:02:07,312 --> 02:02:09,136
''Roshan, wait, l
will let you go. No.''

1002
02:02:09,231 --> 02:02:11,055
Get out of my way.

1003
02:02:33,185 --> 02:02:34,112
He is badly hurt. Just see.

1004
02:02:34,176 --> 02:02:35,999
Take him to the hospital.

1005
02:02:55,282 --> 02:02:59,027
''Ramesh my son, what has
happened to you? My son!''

1006
02:02:59,088 --> 02:03:03,858
''What have you done, my son?''

1007
02:03:03,917 --> 02:03:07,662
''Doctor, save my son. Do
anything, but save my Ramesh.''

1008
02:03:09,642 --> 02:03:11,530
''l beg of you, doctor.''

1009
02:03:17,317 --> 02:03:20,165
Please save my son!

1010
02:03:23,105 --> 02:03:24,929
Please save my son!

1011
02:03:28,830 --> 02:03:32,639
''Ramesh son, are you
angry with your mother?''

1012
02:03:33,658 --> 02:03:35,482
''Why don't you speak, my son?''

1013
02:04:39,857 --> 02:04:42,641
Can l drink some water?

1014
02:04:42,735 --> 02:04:43,599
''Yes, sure. Drink.''

1015
02:04:49,451 --> 02:04:53,196
''Wait the water must be hot.
Nikki, Get one glass of cold water.''

1016
02:04:53,257 --> 02:04:55,113
''Bringing, Ma'am.''

1017
02:04:57,542 --> 02:04:58,951
''Come here, dear.''

1018
02:05:13,404 --> 02:05:16,253
What is your name?
- Roshan.

1019
02:05:18,233 --> 02:05:20,057
Such a lovely name.

1020
02:05:22,998 --> 02:05:26,807
Which class do you study in?
- Sixth. - Sixth?

1021
02:05:29,170 --> 02:05:30,610
Water.

1022
02:05:31,633 --> 02:05:33,489
''Here, drink it.''

1023
02:05:47,974 --> 02:05:49,798
You have buttoned up wrongly.

1024
02:05:50,821 --> 02:05:52,677
Doesn't your mother
care this little much?

1025
02:05:52,740 --> 02:05:54,628
l don't have a mother.

1026
02:05:56,609 --> 02:06:00,354
No mother? And father?

1027
02:06:00,415 --> 02:06:02,271
l have no one in this
world to call my own.

1028
02:06:03,293 --> 02:06:06,142
''Had a friend, but
he too went away.''

1029
02:06:21,522 --> 02:06:23,410
''Why did you start to cry, dear?''

1030
02:06:24,432 --> 02:06:26,256
Don't know why the
tears rolled down.

1031
02:06:31,083 --> 02:06:32,012
Shall l go?

1032
02:06:32,075 --> 02:06:33,963
No. No.

1033
02:06:35,944 --> 02:06:37,768
''Shall l go, mother?''

1034
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:40,647
Mother?

1035
02:07:53,656 --> 02:07:57,400
''Hold this for a while. - But..
- No buts, the police is behind.''

1036
02:07:57,462 --> 02:07:59,350
''Go, run, run.''

1037
02:08:06,096 --> 02:08:08,945
''You go that way, l
will go this way.''

1038
02:08:48,342 --> 02:08:51,126
He came here only.
Where can he go?

1039
02:09:05,579 --> 02:09:09,356
l am not a thief. l didn't
steal. l am not a thief.

1040
02:09:13,254 --> 02:09:16,103
But how can you tell
that he didn't steal?

1041
02:09:16,133 --> 02:09:20,870
l can assure you that my son
is not a thief. He cannot steal.

1042
02:09:21,889 --> 02:09:24,738
''Sit, See, the stolen
goods were found on him.''

1043
02:09:24,767 --> 02:09:27,616
This is somebody's mischief.
He is completely innocent.

1044
02:09:27,677 --> 02:09:29,501
''Please, save him.''

1045
02:09:29,596 --> 02:09:31,420
Please! He is a
child without parents.

1046
02:09:32,442 --> 02:09:34,331
That means he is not your son?

1047
02:09:34,361 --> 02:09:37,210
''Just the way he is my
son, so is he you son too.''

1048
02:09:37,271 --> 02:09:38,135
That means he is an orphan.

1049
02:09:39,190 --> 02:09:41,014
An orphan is more
fortunate than him.

1050
02:09:41,077 --> 02:09:42,933
Because it is known
who his parents are.

1051
02:09:42,996 --> 02:09:45,844
But there is no clue about
this poor one's parents even.

1052
02:09:45,906 --> 02:09:47,730
l got him in the forest.

1053
02:09:48,784 --> 02:09:49,647
ln the forest?

1054
02:09:49,743 --> 02:09:51,567
''Yes, in the forest.''

1055
02:09:51,630 --> 02:09:56,400
l still remember the year
and the date. It was in _94l.

1056
02:09:56,459 --> 02:09:58,283
Fifteenth day of April.

1057
02:09:59,337 --> 02:10:02,121
lt was Tuesday..
no.. it was Wednesday.

1058
02:10:02,184 --> 02:10:05,993
''Around ten in the night, l
was returning from the city.''

1059
02:10:06,053 --> 02:10:08,837
''Near Ramghat, he was
Iying near the fig tree.''

1060
02:10:08,931 --> 02:10:12,708
An infant; must be only 4
-5 months old.

1061
02:10:12,737 --> 02:10:15,586
And you picked
him up from there?

1062
02:10:15,647 --> 02:10:17,471
''Yes, and since then, l
have been raising him up.''

1063
02:10:17,566 --> 02:10:22,303
l've my sympathies with you. l will
try my best to get your son released.

1064
02:10:22,331 --> 02:10:26,108
''Thanks a lot, sir. It will
indeed be you great favor.''

1065
02:10:26,201 --> 02:10:28,024
''Come to the court,
tomorrow morning.''

1066
02:10:28,119 --> 02:10:29,943
Very well. Regards.
- Regards.

1067
02:10:44,429 --> 02:10:46,253
''What have you
started to think, Meena?''

1068
02:11:18,936 --> 02:11:21,784
Chowk Bazaar Police
Station. Produce Roshan.

1069
02:11:43,912 --> 02:11:46,696
''Your Honour, we
found Jamunadas' bag..''

1070
02:11:46,758 --> 02:11:48,647
''..and Rs._O,OOO
l- cash on this boy.''

1071
02:11:50,628 --> 02:11:53,412
lnspector of Chowk
Bazaar Police Station..

1072
02:11:53,506 --> 02:11:55,330
..caught him
running with the bag.

1073
02:12:01,181 --> 02:12:04,926
Did you steal?
- No. l didn't steal.

1074
02:12:04,987 --> 02:12:07,836
Then how did you get
this bag and money?

1075
02:12:08,313 --> 02:12:09,722
Jaggu gave it me.

1076
02:12:09,816 --> 02:12:11,640
Who is Jaggu?

1077
02:12:11,735 --> 02:12:14,519
l don't know. l didn't
steal. l am not a thief.

1078
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:20,278
''Your Honour, stolen goods found
with the boy is important evidence.''

1079
02:12:20,369 --> 02:12:23,153
''To defend himself, he is naming
some imaginary guy named Jaguu.''

1080
02:12:23,247 --> 02:12:25,071
Actually he
himself is the thief.

1081
02:12:25,134 --> 02:12:28,943
''Your Honour, the stolen goods were
definitely found with the boy.''

1082
02:12:29,004 --> 02:12:30,828
But he wasn't caught
while committing a theft.

1083
02:12:30,923 --> 02:12:32,746
Hence he can't be
termed as a thief.

1084
02:12:32,841 --> 02:12:35,625
Even if l agree with your suggestion
that the boy is not the thief..

1085
02:12:35,688 --> 02:12:39,465
..but you can't deny that he is
not involved in a gang of thieves.

1086
02:12:39,557 --> 02:12:42,341
''Your Honour, even if the boy
didn't commit the theft himself..''

1087
02:12:42,435 --> 02:12:44,259
..but he definitely
helped in the theft.

1088
02:12:44,322 --> 02:12:47,171
And the one who helps the thief is
also called a thief and a criminal.

1089
02:12:47,201 --> 02:12:50,017
''You Honour, my learned friend..''

1090
02:12:50,111 --> 02:12:52,895
..accepts that some
gang is behind this theft.

1091
02:12:52,957 --> 02:12:56,766
Then how can only this one
boy labeled as the thief?

1092
02:12:56,795 --> 02:12:59,611
According to the
statement of this boy..

1093
02:12:59,705 --> 02:13:01,528
..Jaggu gave him
this bag and ran away..

1094
02:13:01,623 --> 02:13:03,447
..and hence till such time
Jaggu is presented in this court..

1095
02:13:03,510 --> 02:13:05,399
..this case can't be decided.

1096
02:13:05,429 --> 02:13:08,246
l am confident that this boy is
not guilty and that he is innocent.

1097
02:13:09,299 --> 02:13:12,083
l know his guiltlessness
and innocence very well.

1098
02:13:12,145 --> 02:13:14,994
His character is filled with traits
of hooliganism and crookedness.

1099
02:13:15,983 --> 02:13:19,760
He is an illegitimate child who has
neither any mother nor any father.

1100
02:13:19,852 --> 02:13:22,636
One can't expect
decency from such a child.

1101
02:13:25,577 --> 02:13:28,393
''With the permission of the court,
l would like to state something.''

1102
02:13:28,487 --> 02:13:29,350
Permission granted.

1103
02:13:29,446 --> 02:13:34,183
Even l know of this boy's
guiltlessness and innocence.

1104
02:13:34,211 --> 02:13:38,949
His father's crookedness
created a deep wound in his heart.

1105
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:41,824
''One can't expect decency
from such a child, because..''

1106
02:13:42,846 --> 02:13:44,734
..because his
father was very decent.

1107
02:13:44,765 --> 02:13:46,621
This child is
illegitimate because..

1108
02:13:47,675 --> 02:13:51,419
..her mother's honor and life
were played as if they were toys.

1109
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:53,369
This child is
illegitimate because..

1110
02:13:53,399 --> 02:13:55,287
..the one who ruined
her mother's life..

1111
02:13:55,350 --> 02:13:59,094
..married some other woman
and settled in his life.

1112
02:14:02,034 --> 02:14:04,882
l am recognizing that
decent person very well..

1113
02:14:04,944 --> 02:14:07,728
..the father of this
illegitimate child.

1114
02:14:09,709 --> 02:14:11,566
And l am sure that you
also must be recognizing..

1115
02:14:11,628 --> 02:14:14,476
''..the mother of
this child, very well.''

1116
02:14:14,538 --> 02:14:19,243
''Sorry Madam, this is a case of the
child and not about his parents.''

1117
02:14:22,181 --> 02:14:24,998
The fault is not of the poison
but one who gives the poison.

1118
02:14:27,969 --> 02:14:30,754
''Pardon me, public prosecutor,
today's case is not only of the..''

1119
02:14:30,816 --> 02:14:32,704
..child but also of his parents.

1120
02:14:32,735 --> 02:14:37,472
These are those parents who
throttled the laws of God.

1121
02:14:37,563 --> 02:14:41,340
This statement is neither related
to this case nor to this court.

1122
02:14:41,817 --> 02:14:45,146
This crime is related to
every court of the world.

1123
02:14:46,102 --> 02:14:49,942
''l would like to ask the
world, what justice is this..''

1124
02:14:50,004 --> 02:14:52,852
''..that while they commit the sin,
this child is called a sinner!?''

1125
02:14:53,873 --> 02:14:55,697
''lnebriated by the
youth, they turn blind..''

1126
02:14:55,792 --> 02:14:57,616
..and this child
suffers the blows?

1127
02:14:57,679 --> 02:14:59,536
They commit the mistakes and
he undergoes the punishment?

1128
02:14:59,598 --> 02:15:03,375
''While the world respects
them, he gets kicked!?''

1129
02:15:03,467 --> 02:15:05,291
While this poor soul walks
with his head hung in shame..

1130
02:15:05,386 --> 02:15:07,210
..they walk with
their heads held high?

1131
02:15:08,232 --> 02:15:12,041
''Mr. Lawyer, your court
may pardon such sins..''

1132
02:15:12,102 --> 02:15:13,926
..but the court of God
will never pardon them.

1133
02:15:14,980 --> 02:15:19,717
''Children are not bastards, O lawyer!
Rather the parents are bastards!''

1134
02:15:24,478 --> 02:15:26,398
You are a criminal!

1135
02:15:26,461 --> 02:15:29,310
The consequences of your deeds
reflected in the form of my ruin.

1136
02:15:30,299 --> 02:15:33,115
lnstead of giving respect to a
woman you threw her in the ditch..

1137
02:15:33,209 --> 02:15:35,993
..of helplessness and shame.

1138
02:15:37,014 --> 02:15:41,752
''Today in her tears, your prestige
and name are getting drowned!''

1139
02:15:42,803 --> 02:15:46,547
Her sighs of pain
ruined my motherhood.

1140
02:15:47,568 --> 02:15:53,266
You left Roshan
and Ramesh left us.

1141
02:15:54,315 --> 02:15:58,092
The sighs of that innocent
child set fire to my happiness.

1142
02:15:58,121 --> 02:16:01,898
God punished me for your sin.

1143
02:16:16,798 --> 02:16:18,206
You are going!?

1144
02:16:18,269 --> 02:16:20,125
Because you are the
mother to that child.

1145
02:16:22,138 --> 02:16:24,922
Because you have kept
me in the dark till now.

1146
02:16:26,903 --> 02:16:29,720
''lf you wished, you could've hidden
this secret from me, forever.''

1147
02:16:29,813 --> 02:16:31,637
But you didn't do this.

1148
02:16:32,660 --> 02:16:34,516
''To save your child,
you accepted this.''

1149
02:16:34,578 --> 02:16:37,427
And took the blame of
someone's sin on you.

1150
02:16:41,326 --> 02:16:45,070
I I
''Meena, today you have
grown in my eyes, even more.

1151
02:16:46,091 --> 02:16:47,979
Because today
humanity has arisen in you.

1152
02:16:48,905 --> 02:16:51,785
''For the welfare of a child, you
didn't care for your own life.''

1153
02:16:53,223 --> 02:16:55,142
Go and bring that
child to this house.

1154
02:16:58,595 --> 02:17:01,379
Will you be able to
accept Roshan as Ramesh?

1155
02:17:01,442 --> 02:17:05,251
Why not? It is my duty to
accept all that which is yours.

1156
02:17:05,279 --> 02:17:07,167
All your goodness
is my goodness..

1157
02:17:07,230 --> 02:17:10,974
..and all your
weaknesses are my weaknesses.

1158
02:17:11,995 --> 02:17:13,852
The mistake which you
and Meena committed..

1159
02:17:13,914 --> 02:17:16,762
..anyone may end up
committing a similar mistake.

1160
02:17:18,647 --> 02:17:23,447
But the real person is the
one who realizes his mistakes.

1161
02:17:23,956 --> 02:17:26,325
The one who can
atone for his sins.

1162
02:17:27,377 --> 02:17:30,161
Go and bring Roshan
and illuminate this..

1163
02:17:30,224 --> 02:17:32,080
''..house again, which
is filled with darkness.''

1164
02:17:34,061 --> 02:17:37,838
But how to go in front of
him? What should l tell to him?

1165
02:17:39,914 --> 02:17:44,555
''That son, l am that father of yours,
who had filled your life with..''

1166
02:17:44,711 --> 02:17:46,471
''..darkness, even
before you opened your eyes.''

1167
02:17:46,949 --> 02:17:49,349
Now you come and
illuminate my house.

1168
02:17:49,827 --> 02:17:52,228
''l won't be able to do this,
Malti. l won't be able to do this.''

1169
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:59,905
''Uncle, l'll never do anything bad
again. l'll go to school, everyday.''

1170
02:17:59,965 --> 02:18:03,774
''l promise, l won't go near any bad
person. l won't even talk to them.''

1171
02:18:03,803 --> 02:18:06,619
You have fallen in bad
company. l won't live here.

1172
02:18:06,713 --> 02:18:08,536
The crooks of this colony
will make you a hooligan too.

1173
02:18:08,600 --> 02:18:12,409
''Please forgive me, uncle. - l won't
listen to a single thing from you.''

1174
02:18:12,437 --> 02:18:14,325
''You brought bad name to yourself,
and you did this to me as well.''

1175
02:18:14,388 --> 02:18:18,132
Go and get the cart right now. l'm
asking you to bring the cart. Go.

1176
02:18:59,448 --> 02:19:00,344
Abdul uncle.

1177
02:19:02,358 --> 02:19:03,221
You?

1178
02:19:04,277 --> 02:19:06,100
''Yes, Abdul uncle.''

1179
02:19:09,042 --> 02:19:09,938
Judge sir?

1180
02:19:14,830 --> 02:19:17,614
''Not a judge but a
criminal, Abdul uncle.''

1181
02:19:25,352 --> 02:19:28,168
''Tell me, what brings you here?''

1182
02:19:31,140 --> 02:19:33,924
l have come to
take my son Roshan.

1183
02:19:34,018 --> 02:19:36,802
And what brings you here?

1184
02:19:39,743 --> 02:19:41,599
l have cone to take my son.

1185
02:19:41,693 --> 02:19:43,517
You have come to
take the child!?

1186
02:19:44,475 --> 02:19:47,356
The same child you left
to die a product of sin!

1187
02:19:47,418 --> 02:19:51,195
The one whom you threw in the dense
forest to become a meal to animals?

1188
02:19:51,287 --> 02:19:53,111
You remember that child today?

1189
02:19:53,206 --> 02:19:55,990
Today maternal love
started to flow in your heart!?

1190
02:19:56,053 --> 02:19:57,941
Today you have come as a mother!

1191
02:19:57,971 --> 02:20:00,788
And today you've suddenly
realized your duty of a father!?

1192
02:20:00,881 --> 02:20:04,626
''That sin, that blemish, you are
calling him as your son today!''

1193
02:20:05,647 --> 02:20:08,495
''l ask you, where were you that
day when in the jaws of death..''

1194
02:20:08,525 --> 02:20:12,302
..he was begging for mercy
with his tiny hands spread!?

1195
02:20:12,394 --> 02:20:14,218
When his innocent eyes..

1196
02:20:14,281 --> 02:20:17,130
..were searching for his parents'
Iove in the darkness of the forest.

1197
02:20:17,159 --> 02:20:20,936
Are you his mother?
Are you his father?

1198
02:20:21,125 --> 02:20:24,773
l am his father and mother.

1199
02:20:24,835 --> 02:20:26,723
l picked him up from the pathway
and held him close to my heart.

1200
02:20:26,753 --> 02:20:28,641
l slept in the wet but put
him to sleep in the dry.

1201
02:20:28,704 --> 02:20:32,448
''For eight years, whom l
nurtured with my sweat and blood..''

1202
02:20:32,510 --> 02:20:34,366
..you have come to take him!?

1203
02:20:34,429 --> 02:20:36,317
You have come to snatch away
the support of my old age?

1204
02:20:36,347 --> 02:20:38,235
You have come to rob me of
my wealth in my old age?

1205
02:20:38,298 --> 02:20:40,122
''Get out of here, both of you.''

1206
02:20:40,217 --> 02:20:43,001
You have no claim on him. l
have the claim. l have the claim.

1207
02:20:43,063 --> 02:20:47,832
''You are right, Abdul uncle.
You have the right on Roshan.''

1208
02:20:49,811 --> 02:20:52,595
The one who nurtures has more right
than the one who gives birth.

1209
02:20:52,657 --> 02:20:54,514
''lf you know this,
then, why have you come?''

1210
02:20:55,535 --> 02:20:58,352
To correct my mistake.
To repent on my deeds.

1211
02:20:58,445 --> 02:21:01,229
But why should l
repent by giving him to you?

1212
02:21:01,292 --> 02:21:03,148
l didn't commit any mistake.

1213
02:21:03,211 --> 02:21:06,059
Was it my mistake that l
nurtured and raised him?

1214
02:21:06,089 --> 02:21:07,945
Was it my mistake
that for his happiness..

1215
02:21:08,039 --> 02:21:09,863
..l didn't see the difference
between the day and the night.

1216
02:21:09,958 --> 02:21:11,782
l will not give him to anyone.

1217
02:21:11,845 --> 02:21:13,702
He is mine. He is my son.

1218
02:21:13,764 --> 02:21:15,652
You murdered the
duty of a father..

1219
02:21:15,683 --> 02:21:18,500
..and you had put the
maternal love to shame.

1220
02:21:18,593 --> 02:21:19,456
Abdul uncle.

1221
02:21:20,480 --> 02:21:24,289
''l am a woman, and for a woman there
can't be a greater punishment..''

1222
02:21:24,317 --> 02:21:29,055
..than her trust being crushed in
the guise of a promise of marriage.

1223
02:21:29,146 --> 02:21:30,970
That her love is snubbed.

1224
02:21:34,871 --> 02:21:39,608
''Abdul uncle, helplessness
and the taunts of the society..''

1225
02:21:39,668 --> 02:21:44,437
..crushed the maternal bond
under the burden of cruelty.

1226
02:21:47,375 --> 02:21:49,198
''Not the social law, Meena..''

1227
02:21:49,262 --> 02:21:51,118
..but the
unfaithfulness of the man.

1228
02:21:51,181 --> 02:21:57,839
l.. l compelled you to
throttle your maternal love.

1229
02:21:59,815 --> 02:22:02,664
''Meena, l am guilty to you.
l'm the one to be blamed.''

1230
02:22:06,563 --> 02:22:08,386
''lf possible, please
forgive me, Meena.''

1231
02:22:15,197 --> 02:22:17,981
Social laws couldn't
give me any punishment.

1232
02:22:19,003 --> 02:22:20,860
But the law of God and
the cries of a woman..

1233
02:22:20,922 --> 02:22:22,810
..have given me
such a punishment..

1234
02:22:22,841 --> 02:22:24,697
..that today l am
yearning for a child.

1235
02:22:24,791 --> 02:22:26,615
''That means, you
also need the child.''

1236
02:22:26,710 --> 02:22:28,534
She also needs the child.

1237
02:22:28,597 --> 02:22:31,446
l can't understand what to do?

1238
02:22:32,435 --> 02:22:33,362
Even if l keep a
stone on my heart and..

1239
02:22:33,426 --> 02:22:35,250
..give Roshan
away.. but to whom?

1240
02:22:35,345 --> 02:22:37,168
''lf l give him to you,
he won't get the mother.''

1241
02:22:37,232 --> 02:22:39,088
''lf l give him to her,
he won't get the father.''

1242
02:22:39,151 --> 02:22:40,047
''You only tell me,
what should l do?''

1243
02:22:40,110 --> 02:22:41,998
''You are a judge,
so pass a decision.''

1244
02:22:43,979 --> 02:22:46,763
''What decision will an
accused pass, Abdul uncle?''

1245
02:22:48,745 --> 02:22:51,593
Justice is in the
guilty being punished.

1246
02:22:52,614 --> 02:22:54,438
The punishment to
my crime is that..

1247
02:22:54,533 --> 02:22:58,277
..l should yearn for a child all my
life and die as a childless person.

1248
02:23:01,217 --> 02:23:03,073
You.. give Roshan to Meena.

1249
02:23:03,167 --> 02:23:05,951
Sir.. he still
doesn't get the father.

1250
02:23:06,014 --> 02:23:07,870
People will still
call him illegitimate

1251
02:23:07,933 --> 02:23:09,821
..and raise their fingers at him.

1252
02:23:09,851 --> 02:23:11,739
No one will raise
any finger at him.

1253
02:23:11,802 --> 02:23:13,626
No one will call
him illegitimate.

1254
02:23:13,721 --> 02:23:16,505
l am his father.
- Mr. Advocate!?

1255
02:23:16,567 --> 02:23:22,265
''l am right, Abdul uncle. Meena's
son is my son. l am his father.''

1256
02:23:43,462 --> 02:23:45,286
You are a human
being in true spirit!

1257
02:24:00,731 --> 02:24:01,595
Uncle..

1258
02:24:03,578 --> 02:24:05,434
''Uncle, the cart!''

1259
02:24:10,325 --> 02:24:15,030
''Son, you used to ask who is
your mother.. who is your father?''

1260
02:24:15,091 --> 02:24:17,939
''Today, they themselves
have come to take you.''

1261
02:24:19,919 --> 02:24:24,624
l won't go with them. l
will stay with you. With you.

1262
02:24:24,685 --> 02:24:29,422
''Son, They are your parents.
What relation do you have with me?''

1263
02:24:29,513 --> 02:24:32,297
l was just a medium to
unite you with them.

1264
02:24:32,360 --> 02:24:34,216
''l was just your
gardener, Roshan.''

1265
02:24:34,279 --> 02:24:39,016
They're your parents. You're a
light of their house and not mine.

1266
02:24:41,026 --> 02:24:41,889
Uncle..

1267
02:24:41,954 --> 02:24:45,763
''Son, l feel very
sorry for the fact..''

1268
02:24:45,791 --> 02:24:50,529
..that neither could l feed you
well nor could dress you well.

1269
02:24:50,620 --> 02:24:54,365
Raised you in the
tatters of poverty.

1270
02:24:54,426 --> 02:24:57,274
Except love l
couldn't give anything.

1271
02:24:58,295 --> 02:25:05,881
''Son, you will get love,
comfort, name and prestige.''

1272
02:25:05,939 --> 02:25:09,716
You will get good
education and a bright future.

1273
02:25:09,808 --> 02:25:11,632
They can give you everything.

1274
02:25:11,695 --> 02:25:13,552
l can't give you anything.

1275
02:25:17,483 --> 02:25:21,228
Uncle.. you are crying!?

1276
02:25:21,289 --> 02:25:24,138
''No son, where am l crying?''

1277
02:25:24,167 --> 02:25:26,984
''l am very happy
today, very happy..''

1278
02:25:27,077 --> 02:25:29,861
..that you are going
to your parents' house.

1279
02:25:29,924 --> 02:25:31,780
You are going to bring
light to their house.

1280
02:25:31,843 --> 02:25:34,691
''l raised you for
this very day, son.''

1281
02:25:35,712 --> 02:25:37,536
The lamps of your
memories will always..

1282
02:25:37,631 --> 02:25:39,454
..remain lit in my
house filled with darkness.

1283
02:25:39,518 --> 02:25:44,287
''Son, your voice will
always echo in my years.''

1284
02:25:49,112 --> 02:25:51,929
''Meena Devi, l nurtured
this plant by giving..''

1285
02:25:51,990 --> 02:25:54,838
..him the love of both
the father and the mother.

1286
02:25:54,900 --> 02:25:58,644
Take him and adorn
your house with him.

1287
02:25:58,706 --> 02:26:01,523
May God nurture him
to great heights..

1288
02:26:01,584 --> 02:26:04,432
..and you too also remain
happy and content being with him.

1289
02:26:04,494 --> 02:26:05,357
Go son.

1290
02:26:05,453 --> 02:26:10,158
l won't go with them. l
will stay with you. With you.

1291
02:26:10,219 --> 02:26:11,115
Go son.

1292
02:26:11,178 --> 02:26:14,955
''After getting you, l
had forgotten everything.''

1293
02:26:15,047 --> 02:26:16,871
l had forgotten even my God.

1294
02:26:16,966 --> 02:26:18,790
Give me a chance
to remember Him.

1295
02:26:18,853 --> 02:26:20,710
Let me pray to Him.

1296
02:26:20,772 --> 02:26:23,620
Go.. go to your mother.

1297
02:26:23,682 --> 02:26:26,466
''But where will you go, uncle?''

1298
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:29,344
''You will stay with
us, Abdul uncle.''

1299
02:26:29,407 --> 02:26:33,215
No dear. l am going on
the Holy Pilgrimage of Haj.

1300
02:26:35,195 --> 02:26:37,018
l am going to the
abode of the Lord.

1301
02:26:38,041 --> 02:26:40,890
l am going so far..

1302
02:26:40,919 --> 02:26:44,696
..where my feet do not stumble
because of someone's love.

1303
02:26:44,789 --> 02:26:48,533
There too l will
pray for your welfare!

1304
02:26:48,595 --> 02:26:53,332
May God bless you all! May
you always remain happy!

1305
02:26:54,383 --> 02:27:04,850
''After considering everything
to be own, for sometime..''

1306
02:27:04,936 --> 02:27:07,720
..now l depart!

1307
02:27:11,652 --> 02:27:19,238
l return your world to you..

1308
02:27:20,255 --> 02:27:24,992
..now l depart!
