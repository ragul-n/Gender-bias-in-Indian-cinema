1
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,320
Madhav Sunnipenta.

2
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,660
Zodiac sign is from Revathi...

3
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,060
-Greetings priest.
-Madam, come sit.

4
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,340
-Where does your son live?
-He is staying in Australia.

5
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,680
He will be here in a few days.

6
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,180
-Everything is fine.
-Umm.

7
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,030
Marriages are the decision of God.

8
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,250
It will happen as it
should happen in that way.

9
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,660
Your son will get married...

10
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,750
sooner than you thought.

11
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,820
Ah!

12
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,420
A girl both of you and your son would like
would step in as your daughter-in-law

13
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,300
But...

14
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,470
-Any Doshas (horoscope problems)...
-No... No, nothing like that.

15
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,730
But your son...

16
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:41,630
would marry a girl elder to him,
is what I doubt.

17
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,790
Just according to the
zodiac signs in this.

18
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,820
A girl elder to him?

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,390
SHAADI MUBARAK
(HAPPY WEDDING)

20
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,650
Your son looks handsome madam.

21
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,400
I think he looks just like you?

22
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,100
Nothing like that. But he is mummy's pet.

23
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,420
-Both of share the same tastes.
-Oh!

24
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,080
-If I like something, he does too.
-Umm...

25
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,340
But he put a condition that we
shouldn't come for his match making.

26
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,440
[chuckles]

27
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,700
So, you should take
him for match making.

28
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,470
No problem madam, I'll take him.

29
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,800
This girl looks very nice,
I liked her at first sight.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,530
Who's that girl? Let me see.

31
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,800
[chuckles]

32
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,240
Forget about this girl madam,
she is not the type to settle so quickly.

33
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,180
Not only that,
I guess she is engaged already.

34
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,690
Oh no! This girl is very nice madam,

35
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,490
I got connected in the first sight itself.

36
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,050
She is the same as I expected
my daughter-in-law should be.

37
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,440
Hey, girl! Get up!

38
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,180
What's it so early in the morning, mom?

39
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,020
Ah!

40
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,800
Why did you keep your photo in the album?

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,440
How many times should I warn you not to?

42
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,740
-Which photo mom?
-I am talking about this.

43
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,310
Oh... This one?

44
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,460
I kept it to check if someone would
like my face. I should test it, right?

45
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,010
My foot!
What is the use even if they like it?

46
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,660
You should accept it too!

47
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,030
Every visitor is saying this girl in the
photo is nice as soon as they see it.

48
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,700
Not knowing what to answer to them...

49
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,510
I am saying something to cover it up.

50
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,390
-Your silly pranks are a menace to me!
-What? Did they like me?

51
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,330
Oh yeah! A lot!

52
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,900
Why? Want to get married?

53
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,270
But I should like him too!

54
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,410
You will turn 27 in a couple of days.

55
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,140
And you didn't even get married till now.

56
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,640
How many more years would
you cling on to your Mom?

57
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,390
You and Sudha's son Rakesh,
studied together right?

58
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,250
Hey!

59
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,600
It seems he likes you.

60
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,240
Sudha is calling me daily.

61
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,710
Sudha? Who is she?

62
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,380
Who else? It's her.

63
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,720
-[TV] It's me...
-Oh my God!

64
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,840
It's me, Koti Lingala Kanaka Durga.

65
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,650
-This aunty?-Even if you say 'yes' or 'no'...

66
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,290
-You are my would-be daughter-in-law.
-Daily soap artists are shown like that.

67
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,250
-Would she become a villain for that?
-Mom, please...

68
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,870
It's my birthday day after tomorrow.

69
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,580
At least let me enjoy this one last
birthday without any commitments.

70
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,060
Promise me that you would
listen to me after this birthday,

71
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,400
and marry the one who I
ask you to get married to.

72
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,600
Promise... After this birthday
I will do whatever you say.

73
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,240
And I will marry the guy who you show me.

74
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,050
Aargh! My ill fate.

75
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,030
Alright.
I have to go for two marriages today.

76
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:39,050
An NRI guy will come, stay in the
office take his details and send him.

77
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,480
An NRI? Scapegoat!

78
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,020
Yes, Dinesh... Dinesh Babu.

79
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,140
-Your surname?
-Kodi (chicken).

80
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,180
[cock-a-doodle-doo]

81
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,790
-Kodi?
-Yeah!

82
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,050
[chuckles]

83
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,050
Any packs?

84
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,230
Packs?

85
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,550
These days girls are preferring
four pack abs six pack abs, etc.

86
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,270
Oh... I don't have any
packs, but I'll try.

87
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,530
-I will definitely try!
-Okay.

88
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,000
[keyboard clicking]

89
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,410
Um... Any accidents?

90
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,630
-Accidents?
-Like being in love, pet relationship,

91
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,470
-living together relationship, breakups?
-No... No... No... No.

92
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,150
[chuckles]
I'm a virgin.

93
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,070
-Virgin?
-Yeah!

94
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,380
-For sure?
-Um...

95
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,820
Nice... Okay.

96
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,420
What about your
blood pressure and sugar?

97
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,650
No way!

98
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,060
-But...
-No... No... No... No need to try...

99
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,360
-You'll get them after marriage.
-What?

100
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,880
So Mr. Kodi...
Your last and final question.

101
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,980
[clicks tongue]
Um... Uh?

102
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,760
She is beautiful.

103
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,660
How am I looking?

104
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,290
You are also nice. But she is beautiful.

105
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,700
Ahem!
Mr. Kodi, your last and final question.

106
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,690
[clears throat]
Please ask.

107
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,350
Hmm... Why do you want to get married?

108
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,550
[hen clucking sound]

109
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,030
Funny question!

110
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,380
-I will tell you.
-Hmm...

111
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,580
Why do I want to get married?

112
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,340
-Yeah!
-Tell me?

113
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,900
Well... Uh! Uh!

114
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,230
Yeah, I have a million dollar job.

115
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,430
-In California...
-Um... Huh!

116
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,490
Recently I bought a small flat,

117
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,830
-and a duplex.
-Um.. Huh!

118
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,790
-Smart phone...
-Wow!

119
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,770
Well you see...
everything is smart in my life.

120
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,690
-Hmm...
-But still...

121
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,860
somehow I feel something
is incomplete in my life.

122
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,400
That is why I want to get married.

123
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:49,300
Okay, Mr. Kodi...
So, everything in your life is smart.

124
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,130
-[chuckles] Yeah...
-You still feel your life is incomplete

125
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,890
-Yeah.
-and you want to finish it.

126
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,290
[clicks tongue]
Okay.

127
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,970
Ah? Finish it?

128
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,120
[raining]
[thunders rumbling]

129
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,580
Dad, you are really lucky.

130
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,640
Why dear?

131
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,530
Because you got a wife who is
allowing you to drink daily.

132
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,150
Satya... Sudha aunty has called again.

133
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,820
It seems that Rakesh is coming,

134
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,170
she keeps on asking when
should we fix dates for engagement?

135
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,670
By the way, what's Sudha aunties surname?

136
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,780
Hubby,
what she has to do with the surname?

137
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,580
-Yes, what will you do with the surname?
-Huh! I lived with your surname until now,

138
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,860
later I should live with
his surname, isn't it?

139
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,050
-That's why I should like his surname too.
-[laughing]

140
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,820
Damn! She will not change.

141
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,230
-Dad...
-Tell me dear...

142
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,270
I am watching you since my childhood,

143
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,340
I didn't saw you and mom
anytime fighting,

144
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,290
or mom yelling at you.

145
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,060
How is it possible?

146
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,130
In this generation, I am watching
many people along with my friends.

147
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,950
In few days of
marriage, they start fights,

148
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,750
breakups, divorce...
God, I feel scared of marriage.

149
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,730
But how are you understanding each other?

150
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,050
At the beginning of the marriage,
I was not like this dear.

151
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,880
I didn't want kids so early
and she saying that she needs kids,

152
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,930
like this, we argued a lot.

153
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,780
At that time your mother got pregnant.

154
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,360
Time passed by and she got ninth month.

155
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,500
Even on that day,
it was raining like this.

156
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,190
They took your mom into the ward.

157
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,540
There a person was weeping,

158
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,730
It seems,
that guys wife met with an accident

159
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,880
and got pains in eighth month itself.

160
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,810
Doctors said that they
can only save at least,

161
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,600
the mother or the child.

162
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,750
He said I can live without a child but,

163
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,810
I can't live without my wife.

164
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,000
Destiny had to play it's game.

165
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,220
-His wife died.
-Oh no!

166
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,990
She died giving birth to a son.

167
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,550
When he was crying
sleeping on his wife's dead body,

168
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,340
even now I can hear his pain.

169
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,800
I don't know something
happened to me that day.

170
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,460
When I saw that a husband
can love his wife so much that...

171
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,380
The first time there came an
unknown change in my life.

172
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,240
I got changed without knowing.

173
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,630
From then I didn't say a word to your mom.

174
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,300
But even now I feel sometimes that,

175
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,870
I want to see how he
raised a motherless child.

176
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,220
What else he would do, dad,
he might have got married again.

177
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,910
A husband who loves his wife that
much, wouldn't get married again.

178
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,260
-I don't think so.
-Enough of gossiping, go and sleep.

179
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,180
-Go dear...
-Okay, I will.

180
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,250
What business do I have between you both?

181
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,550
Ah? Why don't you go getting married?

182
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,750
Um...
Is it enough if you get a nice husband?

183
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,260
Even I should get one...

184
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,850
With whom I can gossip.

185
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,400
Are you listening to
what she is talking about?

186
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,460
[inhales sharply]

187
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,540

[keeps sneezing]

189
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,800
Did you see, before dying your
mother habituated it to your daughter too.

190
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,550
Yeah, thank you!

191
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,940
I will call you later.

192
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,680
What is it, dad?
Why are you watching me like that?

193
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,560
-This saree...
-Damn!

194
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,080
Please! Mom already told me.

195
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,240
She said its a thirty years old saree!

196
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,480
Don't repeat it, huh!

197
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,760
You know what is the
specialty of this saree?

198
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,530
Tell me, what is it's speciality?

199
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,720
Thirty years ago,

200
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,790
I fell for your mom when
I saw her in this saree.

201
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
-[laughs]
-What?

202
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,110
-Seriously?
-Yes.

[horns blaring]

204
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,520
-It's your birthday today...
-Yeah.

205
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,350
-Any new resolutions?
-What else dad?

206
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,140
Just like every time, same
Paradise biryani with the same friends.

207
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,910
[both laugh]

208
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,540
Yeah, you have made a promise to your mom.

209
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,770
Yes, she was asking me to get married...

210
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,460
so I have sanctioned her request.

211
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,590
-Umm...
-Can I ask you one thing?

212
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,940
-Ask me, dear.
-What type of son-in-law you want?

213
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,860
Whoever you like is the one I like.

214
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,840
But darling, I have one wish left.

215
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,510
Say it... Say it.

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,350
-Don't I booze alone daily?
-Hmm...

217
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,580
I am getting bored of it.

218
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,120
If I get a son-in-law who
can booze along with me...

219
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,170
-that would be fun.
-Super.

220
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,730
-Okay, sanctioned.

What happened to her?

227
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,780
It's hurting so much. Ah!

228
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,470
-I'll return home then.
-No need.

229
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,170
You go to the office, is she with you?

230
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,780
What happened mom?

231
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,940
I gave a word to a guy that I'd taka
him to see a prospective bride.

232
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,380
But I'm in this condition now.

233
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,500
That guy came from Australia.

234
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,120
Can you do me a small favor?

235
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,210
Yeah tell me.

236
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,570
At least could you take
him for match making?

237
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,750
Are you crazy? How can I go
for match making with some stranger?

238
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,070
-I gave him a word dear.
-I will not go.

239
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,990
It's our family business anyway.

240
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,400
What's wrong in this?

241
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,760
If I can't, you have to.

242
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,780
Don't corner me with your sentiment.

243
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,050
As today is good day,
I planned three match makings.

244
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,960
Everyone knows that you are
my daughter wherever you go.

245
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,670
They won't think anything
wrong if you go along.

246
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,660
Ramesh would drive the car.

247
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,220
And that guy would be
waiting in Mantra Mall.

248
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,930
Ramesh knows all the addresses.

249
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,620

How should I call him now?

Is it the same guy attending
the three match makings?

Or is it different guys?

297

be the same, but girls would change.

00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,200
-It's common!
-Uh! Uh!

520
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,760
Is it wrong to look at girls?

521
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,760
What are you talking madam?

522
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,090
It's an attraction, miss.

523
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,300
-[mocks]
-opposite attraction.

524
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,150
Opposites it seems.

525
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,150
Hey, Lingam, at least you tell her,
you are also a man.

526
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,290
Now I am a husband sir, not a man.

527
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,310
-[chuckles]
-You..

528
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,040
You are enough...

529
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,060
By the way, do you have any flashbacks?

530
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,450
-What?
-I'm asking, do you have any love stories?

531
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,210
No way, I don't have any
flashbacks like you, sir.

532
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,130
Even I don't have any flash backs,

533
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,630
it's common, anyone would follow girls.

534
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,280
-Take a look at there.
-Why?

535
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,140
Just take a look.

536
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,810
So, what?

537
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,970
They are following our
vehicle, watching you for an hour.

538
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,280
How do you know?

539
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,330
They are watching you
and I am watching them.

540
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,100
[laughs]

541
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,350
Now tell me, are they criminals because
they are looking at you? Is it a crime?

542
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,110
It's human nature madam,
it's common at that age.

543
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,720
-Even I was the same.
-So, now you are matured?

544
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,010
Is it?

545
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,850
That is why I came for match making.

546
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:11,590
[chuckles]

547
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,440
Still, you will be like this?
Be comfortable madam.

548
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,070
Behave normally.

549
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,270
-Thanks.
-It's okay.

550
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,610
Thank God!
Now the vehicle is in fourth gear.

551
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,520
[breaths out]

552
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:35,540
Thank you.

553
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,160
Ramesh, stop the car if you
come across any mobile shop.

554
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,230
Okay, madam. There is one in
some distance I will stop there.

555
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,940
[phone rings]

556
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,010
-Where are you?
-On the way.

557
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,950
That guy is going for bridal
seeings for the first time,

558
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:56,460
I would have told him how to behave
wherever we go, if I were there.

559
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,640
Alright, now tell him.

560
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,420
Huh!

561
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,550
They will keep snacks wherever you go.

562
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,250
Tell him not to eat more
and stay away from food

563
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,390
If he eats food as it tastes good,
they will think he liked the girl.

564
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,520
Even if he likes the girl,
ask him not to disclose it there.

565
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,400
Tell him to say, 'I will discuss
with my parents and tell you'.

566
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,410
By the way, how is the guy?
I just saw him in the photo.

567
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,220
Okay, okay. That's all fine.

568
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,220
As soon as this Sunnipenta's file closes,

569
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,530
-you've to pay me 25% of the commission.
-What a shame!

570
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,790
Um... Alright.

571
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,800
What is this madam?
Is my life seems like a file to you?

572
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:31,900
Hmm...

573
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,080
[chuckles]

574
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,570
By the way, what's the name of
the girl who we are going to see?

575
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:46,730
[gasps] Without knowing her name
you got ready for match making?

576
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:47,560
Huh!

577
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,890
Fine, her name is...

578
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:53,400
Indumathi. I scored 95% in my
10th standard. In inter 96%

579
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,010
and B.Tech I scored 8.5 GPA.

580
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,040
-Indumathi?
-Um...

581
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,750
-It's her first time for match making.
-Oh!

582
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,340
She is little shy.

583
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,930
-You should only talk first.
-Oh! Even it's my first time.

584
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,580
Fresh from America.

585
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,160
-[chuckles]
-By the way...

586
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,510
You were coming
yesterday, but you came today.

587
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,000
I mean, yesterday I went to...

588
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,080
-Ah?
-I was busy.

589
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,940
-Oh!
-But I am fresh from America.

590
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,960
[dog growls]
Hey! Stop there!

591
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,020
Stop there man!

592
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,620
-Hey, catch him guys!
-Hey!

593
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,440
-Look!
-Hey!

594
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:24,900
Hey!

595
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,440
-Hey!
-Oh my God!

596
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,600
[bashing]
[groans]

597
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:40,230
Boss, he is the guy who is
escaping without returning the money.

598
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,870
Get him in the vehicle.

599
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,630
Who is he?

600
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,440
[engine starts]

601
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,180
He said that he will give the
phone back in an hour madam.

602
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,050
Take this.

603
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,840
Ow! It's so hard!

604
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:03,890
Huh?

605
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,340
You will have dental
issues if you eat these all.

606
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,490
-What's his problem?-
-Do you know...

607
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,260
how expensive is dental treatment in US?

608
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,030
Hubby, what shall we do now?

609
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,230
I too don't understand dear.

610
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,420
Sunnipenta's son is on the
way and this guy is here.

611
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,930
Don't know what we shall do.

612
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,630
Oh no! Then call Jayamma once.

613
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,970
Yeah, I will do it now/

614
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,070
What? The guy who has to
come yesterday came today?

615
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,270
Yeah, do something madam.

616
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,630
Alright don't you worry.

617
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,000
I'll manage somehow.

618
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,670
-What kind of girl you want?
-Actually...

619
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,870
everything in my life is smart.

620
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,330
-Oh!
-Smart flat...

621
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,680
Smart car, smart T. V.

622
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,220
Smart phone.

623
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,130
Though I have every
smart thing in my life,

624
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,150
I feel some incomplete feeling.

625
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,810
That is why I was wishing the girl who I'm
going to get married should also be smart.

626
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,610
-Yeah, mom?
-Where are you?

627
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,560
We will reach there in
the next ten minutes.

628
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,540
Immediately stop the car
aside, come out and talk to me.

629
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,900
Tsk! Ramesh, please stop the car.

630
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,200
[horn blaring]

631
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,000
Yes, mom? Tell me.

632
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,010
To the house, you are going now,
another guy went to see the girl.

633
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,430
Huh! Another guy went there?

634
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,330
Who is he?

635
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,830
He is also our customer only...

636
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,040
Kodi Dinesh Babu,

637
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,700
I asked him to go
yesterday but he went today.

638
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,180
Oh, that guy?

639
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,760
If you people go there when he
is present it wouldn't look nice.

640
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,840
Just spend the time for an
hour, talking something.

641
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,510
You can go there when I call you again.

642
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,490
[chuckles] Alright, bye.

643
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,230
[laughs]
[pigeon coos]

644
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:36,270
Not only this guy even she
is also on the same track.

645
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,250
[laughing]

646
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,950
-[chuckles]
-Why are you laughing?

647
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,400
I will also laugh if
you tell me what it is?

648
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,080
Your smile is so good.

649
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,870
I mean, you look so good while you laugh.

650
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,580
Mr. Sunnipenta, I am reminding
you that you are my customer.

651
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,460
Oh!

652
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,360
You know, I look beautiful...

653
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,500
not only while smiling, but even
while coughing or while sneezing. So what?

654
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,360
You know it seems that I
snort beautifully while sleeping,

655
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,200
my mom says this.

656
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,700
-So?
-Why are you getting angry?

657
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,130
I told you the right thing.

658
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,230
Don't confuse me madam.
I am tensed actually.

659
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,350
Tension? For what?

660
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,050
Because

661
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,340
I didn't ever think that
I would go to see girls like this.

662
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,740
Judging a girl in just half an hour...

663
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,230
Uh! Uh! It's highly impossible.

664
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,420
Oh! Is that your tension?

665
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,450
Hmm...

666
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,870
By the way,
do you believe in love at first sight?

667
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,430
Hmm... Of course!

668
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,500
Huh... Then,

669
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,190
it would even happen in
the match making, right?

670
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:56,650
Simple.

671
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:01,640
May be.

672
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,970
What type of girl are you looking?

673
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,050
[chuckles]

674
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,090
-To be frank...
-Tell me,

675
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,160
like your friend told me about you,

676
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,960
you need long hair girl, the waist should
be good, and walking style should be good.

677
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,270
You have many tastes like this.

678
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,330
At last, what have you fixed for?

679
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,530
I used to have these things before,
but nothing like that now.

680
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:26,010
-At least that girl should be...
-Yeah, tell me... at least?

681
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,960
Hmm... don't be shy.

682
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,310
-Tell me.
-Anyone like you is enough.

683
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,400
Sorry.

684
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,890
Water...

685
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,540
'At least like me?'

686
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,480
Idiot!

687
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,680
You are finished!

688
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:46,280
You tell me I am at least,
who came to take you for match making.

689
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,190
Idiot!

690
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,180
What he would have brought in this bag?

691
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:54,940
Let's check it.

692
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,350
[humming]

693
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,400
Hey!
[perfume hisses]

694
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,700
What's this box?

695
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:11,970
Ring?

696
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,600
Oh you!
You want to put it if you like the girl...

697
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,310
Let me try it.

698
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,780
It's matching to my dress too.

699
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,300
Oh no!

700
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,470
Why did I got trapped like this?

701
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,640
Ah!

702
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,100
He is also coming back,
come out of my finger.

703
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,000
[grunts]

704
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,340
[groans]

705
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,300
-Oh damn!
-Oh!

706
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,540
God!

707
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,700
He shouldn't see it, he shouldn't...

708
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,060
My ring!

709
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,950
Yeah, what happened Sunnipenta?

710
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,370
Where is my ring madam?

711
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,230
-It's right to your hand.
-Not this madam.

712
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,330
The one which should be in this box.

713
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,940
-Where have it fall?
-Hey, what are you doing?

714
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,190
You might have forgot it at home.

715
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,160
Yeah, looks like your mom would take it.

716
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,790
Uh! Uh! Your dad might have taken it.
[fingers snapping]

717
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,190
No madam, they don't know anything,

718
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,680
By the way,
what's the specialty of this ring?

719
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,230
I bought it with my first salary.

720
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,450
I thought to gift it to the
girl who comes into my life.

721
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,740
Oh no!
It happened exactly as I thought.

722
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,160
I kept it unnecessarily.
Sunnipenta they are waiting for us.

723
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,860
We will get late. Ramesh will
search the ring if it is in the car.

724
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,320
[sniffs] Looks like
it's my perfume's smell.

725
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,410
What? What perfume?

726
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,920
My perfume...

727
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,380
Yours only, Ramesh, start the car.
[engine starts]

728
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,910
[sniffs] Same, it's coming
from you only. You drive.

729
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,420
The last Telugu film you watched is?

730
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:16,600
-Tho... Tho... Tholi... Tholi Prema...
-Tholi Prema?

731
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,170
It's my favorite film.

732
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,790
Power Star Pawan Kalyan sir, I love him.

733
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,840
Actually, film was good but...

734
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,610
-There is a problem in the climax.
-Problem?

735
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,090
When Keerthi Reddy said 'I won't
go to America I will stay here...'

736
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,070
But Pawan Kalyan says,
'no, I will stay here.'

737
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,140
He missed a chance.

738
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,970
If Pawan Kalyan would
have gone to U. S. with her.

739
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,510
He used to get the green card,

740
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,490
even his children would
have got green card, right?

741
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,010
He used to get free medical
insurance too, right?

742
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,980
Their children used to
get free education, right?

743
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,030
Thank you.

744
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,060
See, he missed a golden chance.

745
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,270
That is why I stopped
watching Telugu films.

746
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,000
You comment on our Power Star?

747
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,030
[engine starts]
In unison: Bye.

748
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,000
-Hey come in.
-Yeah, get in.

749
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,980
Where are you going? Go welcome the groom.

750
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,810
Another guy came,

751
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,190
they just have breakfast, coffee and leave.

752
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,650
She would say not okay, or he would.

753
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,170
He looks like a hero,
at least let this match happen God.

754
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,940
Sir, snacks are very tasty in this house.

755
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,100
-How do you know?
-I am coming for the 4th time now.

756
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,110
-[laughs]
-You bloody!

757
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,600
-Hi, aunty!
-Hi, dear.

758
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,360
Please come in.

759
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,810
-Hope you are fine dear.
-I am fine aunty.

760
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,250
-Krishnaveni...
-Mr. Sunnipenta.

761
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,400
-Greetings.
-Madhav.

762
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,070
Yeah, Madhav Sunnipenta.

763
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,200
You come talk to the girl,
she is waiting in the garden.

764
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:25,800
All the best!

765
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,900
-Hmm? Thank you.
-Hmm.

766
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,630
Aunty where is the wash room?

767
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:32,450
Come dear.

768
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,640
I should get rid of it anyhow.

769
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,830
Oh God! Come out!

770
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:52,350
[laughs]

771
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,230
She is my aunty.

772
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,540
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

773
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,820
Indu feels little shy.

774
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,240
As it's her first time for match making.

775
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,450
You should only talk first.

776
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,480
Alright.

777
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:05,770
[chuckles]

778
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:10,790
Um... Actually, this isn't
my first time as she said.

779
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,830
Um... Already someone came before you.

780
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,620
Oh!
[laughs]

781
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,470
-Okay.
-Have it.

782
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,650
It's okay, have it. I won't think
that you like me after eating.

783
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,150
Thank you.
[chuckles]

784
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,290
Snacks tastes super in this house sir.

785
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,800
Do you talk truth every time like this?

786
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,280
I mean, even you would also say the truth.

787
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,560
[laughs]

788
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,490
I will see its end. Ah!

789
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:52,360
Ah!

790
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,790

Please... Please...

794
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,200
Satya, grandma is calling you.

795
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,610
Yes, I am coming.

796
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,200
I have to manage to hide this ring anyhow.

797
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,090
-Come sit down.
-Yes, grandma.

798
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,370
Hope you are fine?

799
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:22,150
Hey, your mom does everyone's marriages,

800
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,350
won't she get you married?

801
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,590
I will marry this year.

802
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,580
-You say the same thing every time.
-Hey! Snuff!

803
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,740
Grandma, something fell down there.

804
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,160
There... near the tree.

805
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:36,900
Look at it.

806
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:39,660
[clears throat]

807
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,020

808
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,440
Um... How do you know that girl?

809
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,510
I got to know here just today.

810
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,610
Oh!

811
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,010

00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,530
Um... coffee.

813
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,780

[sniffs]

816
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,730
Do you want me to
search for a guy for you?

817
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,870
[sneezes]

818

820
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,050
So, funny.

-Have the coffee.
-Thank you.

825
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,090
So, what's your next plan today?

826
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,610
I have to go for two more
match making after you.

827
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,880
Oh, you are also saying the truth.

828
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,070
-You only taught this.
-Oh!

829
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,120
Then you are not saying the actual truth?

830
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,790
What?

831
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,490
About that girl.

832
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,330
Did you like her?

833
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,460
Hmm...

834
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,880
Did you really like her?

835
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,180
Huh? Which girl?

836
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,000
Indumathi.

837
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,600
Oh Indumathi?

838
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:22,660
No, no.

839
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:25,450
-I mean, she is okay.
-What?

840
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:29,120
She is good nice girl, very frank.

841
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,470
Tsk! Did you like her or not?

842
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,550
Hmm... I don't know...

843
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,370
-I am in confusion.
-What?

844
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,030
How should I say?

845
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,440
I sat in front of her and spoke to her.

846
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,140
But I couldn't see her properly.

847
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:50,040
Hey, man! The snack is very tasty!

848
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:51,950
What is it a joke?

849
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,480
Then what did you do?

850
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,500
I am talking with you and
what are you watching on mobile?

851

[sneezing]

852
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,940
Are you mad?

853
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:08,620
You said that you look
beautiful while sneezing so...

854
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,420
Mr. Sunnipenta,
I took you for match making.

855
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,760
Not to record my videos.

856
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,540
-Ramesh, stop the car.
-Hey, Ramesh, don't stop... Please.

857
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,660
Hey!

858
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:20,340
You take care of your match makings,

859
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,930
I won't come with you, goodbye!

860
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,710
-Hey, please.
-Huh!

861

Hello... Hello Satya Bhama!

869
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,860
You got a call.

870
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,450
Happy birthday.

871
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:57,430
What?

872
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,760
Hello?
Thank you.

873
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:02,490
Is it?

874
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:05,120
Tsk! Let's meet today evening.

875
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:10,010
We were traveling together since morning,
you should've told me it's your birthday.

876
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:14,190
Are you my relative or friend to
tell you that it's my birthday?

877
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:15,520
You are just a customer.

878
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,690
At least did you got to know
now that today is my birthday?

879
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:22,220
I came with you as my mom is not well.

880
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,900
When I came spoiling my birthday plans,

881
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,870
but you are saying you
didn't saw the girl,

882
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:30,470
you got confused. Why?
Why did you get confused?

883
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:34,680
I beg you! You go for your match making,

884
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,920
and I will enjoy my birthday.

885
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,630
Bye!

886
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,240
Hello, you told me that I am
your customer, please waits.

887
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,420
I am also paying you the commission,
how it would be if you leave like this?

888
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,850
Please... Actually, I am so nervous now.

889
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:50,780
It's new thing for me.

890
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,160
I feel better if you are around, please.

891
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,160
Ugh! Look, I will come with
you only if you behave nicely.

892
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,730
Okay, okay. Done.

893
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:01,830
Every year I've a habit of eating biryani
in Paradise Restaurant with friends.

894
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,110
As soon as you finish your second seeing,

895
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:06,090
you must only take me for lunch,

896
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:07,510
-okay?
-Okay, sure. Sanctioned

897
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,480
-I am starving here. Come on!
-Okay.

898
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,090
Can I call you Satya Bhama?

899
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,660
At least Satya?

900
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:18,400
Okay, sanctioned.

901
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,610
Thank you.

902
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:47,080
[music]

903
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,480
-[clicks tongue]
-Huh?

904
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,090
Will you take a look to your right?

905
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,890
-Are you talking about the blue saree girl?
-[gasps]

906
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,430
You saw her already?

907
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,870
-Didn't you like her?
-Uh! Uh!

908
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,680
Why? She is wearing a saree only.

909
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,330
She just rolled the saree,
but didn't drape it as you did.

910
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,480
Huh? Mr. Sunnipenta...

911
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,390
-Madam, I will bring your phone.
-Okay.

912
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:20,850
-What year you have born?
-Huh!

913
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,680
You told me it's your birthday, so...

914
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,520
Just wanted to know in
which year have you born?

915
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,890
What's the matter?

916
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:29,440
-Uh! Uh!
-[chuckles]

917
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,780
[clears throat]

918
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,320
Um... People say that they can't
forget their first crush right?

919
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:52,400
-Uh?
-Did you forget?

920
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,850
I mean,
did you forget that long hair girl?

921
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:59,190
Oh! I don't even remember her face.

922
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:01,880
Yes, you liked many other
girls after that right?

923
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:04,990
[birds chirping]

924
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,560
I will ask you one thing will you answer?

925
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,190
-Hmm?
-Why do you wanna get married?

926
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:13,590
-What?
-Why are you getting married?

927
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,530
Huh, fine.

928
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,470
Just assume that you have
married a girl who you like.

929
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:25,650
Can you take care of her
life long with the same love?

930
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:26,800
[chuckles]

931
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,080
Actually,
I understand what you want to ask me.

932
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,990
There were two professors in my college.

933
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:36,080
They are wife and husband.

934
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,360
They always used to fight.

935
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,250
We used to doubt that they really
love each other, are they married.

936
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,420
Suddenly, one day she died.

937
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,310
What?

938
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,310
Later after two days, he also died.

939
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,110
-Do you know why?
-Why?

940
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:59,590
You left me alone,
there is no one that I can argue with.

941
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,640
I will argue with you only,

942
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,720
he wrote a suicide note and he died.

943
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:12,350
Fighting always doesn't
mean that they don't have love.

944
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,280
They love each other that
they can die for each other.

945
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,360
That is what marriage is.

946
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:20,100
That type of bonding should be present.

947
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,120
Though I like many girls in my life,
the wife I think about should be the same.

948
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,010
Second house after taking left.

[music mutes voices]

952
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,050
-Are we at the right address?
-Hmm...

953
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,130
Who are these goons?

954
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,310
This is the address.

955
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,430

00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,720
-What happened?
-I can smell biryani.

958
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:56,090
Oh God!

959
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:05,810

-Greetings.
-Greetings.

961
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,600
My name is Srinivas Rao,
everyone call me Senapathi.

962
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,360
Oh.

963
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,870
Your mom told me that you are coming.

964
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:12,580
Is it?

965
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,290
-You came to see my sister.
-Oh!

966
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,210
-Come in boy.
-Yeah, come.

967
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:19,680
Hey, did I pay you commission to
see this type of rowdy matches?

968
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,630
If your brother-in-law is strong
then it's safe for you right?

969
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:22,810
-Come on.
-Hell with you!

970
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:24,490

She is my wife.

-Greetings.
-Greetings.

973
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:27,540
You know her right?
She is Jayamma's daughter.

974
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:28,940
-She is my aunt, she is my sister-in-law.
-Greetings.

975
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,330
-My younger sister-in-law.
-Greetings.

976
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:31,070
Everyone live here.

977
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,620
Boy, my sister is inside, go talk to her.

978
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,350
-Okay.
-Sena...

979

-Your mom asked us not to eat right?
-Shh...

984
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,420
-Come on.
-Ah!

985
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,070
-Ah! What?
-Wait!

986
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,790
What are you doing? Will
you have if they invite you?

987
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:51,770
Look Sunnipenta,
the biryani smells so tempting.

988
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:54,620
I am hungry, I will die if didn't eat.

989
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,570
-Come on.
-Oh God!

990

Talk something,

997
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:20,870
or else they will think
that we came just for eating.

998
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:21,540

-it seems that you liked the girl?
-What?

I didn't like her,
there is nothing like that aunty.

What? Then, he told me that,

and called your mom it seems.

Do you want me to die? You greedy fellow!

1045
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,740
You kept three bridal
seeings one day itself.

1046
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,820
As if Muhammad Ghazni
going to invasions...

1047
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,960
-[laughs]
-When asked you say that you didn't like,

1048
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,170
I didn't connect to her... Why?

1049
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,870
Why didn't like it? What happened to you?

1050
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:27,090
Hello!
It's my wish that I would like or dislike.

1051
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,330
Still, you like me? No, right?

1052
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:31,260
This is similar!
What's a defect in me?

1053
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,310
Everyone has their own likes.

1054
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,940
Still, I don't want anything,
I will not go to see any other girl.

1055
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,040
Ramesh stop the car.

1056
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:40,540
No, no, no... Sorry,
I am sorry Sunnipenta.

1057
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,550
I am really sorry, Sunnipenta.

1058
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,990
Please don't call me Sunnipenta.
Call me Madhav.

1059
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:49,030
-Damn! What's your surname?
-Thupakula.

1060
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:49,870
Ah?

1061
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,160
-Thupakula?
-[mouthing gun fire]

1062
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,080
-Madhav, I am sorry.
-I beg you, Thupakula Satya Bhama madam.

1063
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,350
-Please stop the car... Stop the car.
-Okay sir.

1064
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:05,040
I am sorry... Oh no!

1065
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:08,640
Tell me what type of girl you want,

1066
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,450
-I will search for her.
-No need.

1067
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:14,460
Hey, Mr. Sunnipenta... At least is it
okay, if I show you a girl like me?

1068
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:15,860
[sighs]

1069
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:22,090
I came with full clarity,
you confused it all.

1070
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,440
-It is all because of you.
-What did I do?

1071
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:26,870
Since morning,
your silly questions and my silly answers.

1072
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:29,720
You sneeze in the first house, you trap
me having lunch in the other house.

1073
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,310
Finally, take it off, take it off.

1074
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:33,630
Oh no! I got caught.

1075
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,430
-What is this?
-Huh?

1076
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,650
-You stole it.
-I didn't do it wanted.

1077
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:39,810
-It got stuck.
-Yeah, you would say so.

1078
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,170
Sorry, Sunnipenta,
I will return your ring.

1079
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:47,400
Come on let's go, please.

1080
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:49,330
This is all because of my father.

1081
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,750
-Your father?
-Yes, my dad.

1082
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,950
Some priest told him that I would
marry a girl who is elder than me.

1083
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:58,660
-Oh!
-He got worried,

1084
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,520
and arranged match makings in hurry.

1085
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,770
Oh, you have this story too?

1086
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:05,710
[chuckles]
By the way, when are you born?

1087
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:11,160
-1994.-1994?

1088
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,120
In which month?
[birds chirping]

1089
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:19,180
-February.
-Same year and same month.

1090
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:25,490
-On which day?
-Today.

1091
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:26,800
Today?

1092
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,530
-Hmm...
-Your birthday?

1093
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:30,390
Why didn't you told me
about this since morning?

1094
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:33,760
I never celebrate birthday.

1095
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,640
Why? Tell me.

1096
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,950
My date of birth and
mom's date of death is today.

1097
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:43,120
What?

1098
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,430
My mom died giving birth to me.

1099
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:50,330
Then who was your mom on phone?

1100
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:53,320
She raised me without
remembering my mom.

1101
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,520
-I am sorry.
-It's okay.

1102
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:07,920
-Happy birthday Madhav.
-Thank you.

1103
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:09,490
Same to you.

1104
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,010
You told me that you would show
me a girl like you, shall we go?

1105
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:23,130
[laughs]
Hmm...

1106
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:29,170
"Your heart has reached mine"

1107
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:34,640
"And this moment has turned like her"

1108
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:39,600
"The words inside you have
floated in my thoughts"

1109
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:45,010
"and perched on the clouds crossing you"

1110
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:51,610
"The moment the eyes opened,
they searched for love"

1111
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:57,130
"And the lips talked only
about each other's name"

1112
00:58:57,330 --> 00:59:01,710
"Your heart has reached mine"

1113
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,940
"I've changed like him this second"

1114
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:29,230
[music mutes voices]

1115
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:34,640
"There are heavy ongoing
conversations outside"

1116
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:40,340
"But inside, they are
feeling good about it"

1117
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:46,050
"There were wonders of
love at their first sight"

1118
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:51,270
"And each of them are walking into
each other as if it is a milky way"

1119
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:54,560
"The moment they have met"

1120
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:02,410
"They have stood like a pair united"

1121
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:07,200
"Your heart has reached mine"

1122
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,820
"And this moment has turned like her"

1123
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:19,810
"Oh Krishna, please come soon!"

1124
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:28,600
"Oh Krishna, please come soon!"

1125
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:32,220
-Madhav.
-Hmm.

1126
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:33,840
Nice!

1127
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,240
Do you drink alcohol?

1128
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:38,530
No... No...

1129
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,140
Oh man!

1130
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:43,240
-What kind of guy do you want actually?
-I am okay with anyone.

1131
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,110
But my daddy wants a son-in-law who'd
give him company during boozing.

1132
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:52,060
You are doomed, Madhav!

1133
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:56,430
"As if we found what we wished for"

1134
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:02,130
"my heart pounded so loudly"

1135
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:10,490
"As if I turned into a baby"

1136
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:15,900
"my heart started to jump
around due to this new feeling"

1137
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:21,590
"Don't know which
memories we grew up on"

1138
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:26,790
"he has bonded our hearts now"

1139
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:31,830
"Your heart has reached into hers"

1140
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:37,220
"And this moment has turned like her"

1141
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:42,820
"The words inside you have
floated in my thoughts"

1142
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:48,360
"and perched on the clouds crossing you"

1143
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,780
What is your time of birth?

1144
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:50,500
6 pm.

1145
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:51,790
What about you?

1146
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:52,630
8 pm.

1147
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:55,570
Are you believing in what Seer told?

1148
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:57,360
No way. I won't believe him now, at all.

1149
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,660
This is your third matchmaking.

1150
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,170
Is the third matchmaking
really necessary, sir?

1151
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,050
-Hey Lingam!
-Hey... I was kidding.

1152
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:32,240
You understood everything,
right? So, shut up!

1153
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,140
-Hey Ramesh, go.
-Okay, madam.

1154
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,570
Satya, we are going to cut the cake
together after this matchmaking.

1155
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:39,610
You shall arrive only in a saree.

1156
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:40,890
-You!
-Hey!

1157
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,880
Greetings... Greetings... Greetings...

1158
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:45,910
-Greetings, uncle.
-Greetings, uncle.

1159
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:46,960
Oh, you have arrived!

1160
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,010
How are you doing, dear?

1161
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:51,950
I am doing good, uncle.

1162
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:52,940
How is your mom?

1163
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,820
She is good too.

1164
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,580
I've been at the home
since you'd arrive.

1165
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:57,830
Come on in... Come...

1166
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,720
Come...

1167
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:02,070
I think I have seen this guy somewhere.

1168
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:07,110
What's his name, dear?

1169
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:08,850
Madhav, isn't it?

1170
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:09,850
Last name?

1171
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:10,770
Sunnipenta.

1172
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:12,390
Sunnipenta?

1173
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:15,270
Madhav Sunnipenta.

1174
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:18,230
I think I have seen you somewhere.

1175
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:19,710
No, uncle. No chance.

1176
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,500
I stay in Australia.

1177
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,180
Since I am a policeman,
I'd remember something out of blue.

1178
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:26,010
Come on in... Come...

1179
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,400
What's your last name?

1180
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:34,400
Sunnipenta? Sunnipenta?

1181
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,740
Sunnipenta? Madhav Sunnipenta?

1182
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:41,470
You'd used to live in
Ameerpet six years ago.

1183
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,970
At Pragati junior college.

1184
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:48,680
-Did you recognize me?
-Uh-uh.

1185
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:50,920
-Did you recognize me?
-Hmm.

1186
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:53,860
It's me...

1187
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:58,910
I am CI Ajay Kumar who has taken you and
your friends to the station and bashed.

1188
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,390
Did you recognize me?

1189
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:02,840
Good news for you.

1190
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:04,920
Do you know who you are here to see?

1191
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
The same girl.

1192
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:07,230
Do you know her name?

1193
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,360
Did you forget her name already?

1194
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,770
Bhagyamathi, my daughter.

1195
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:13,330
Well, dear...

1196
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:14,610
Six years ago,

1197
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:19,920
since he and his
friends were behind my daughter,

1198
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:24,480
I have taken them to the police
station and whacked them.

1199
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:25,430
You too forget about that incident.

1200
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:26,610
What is that we can about it?

1201
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:28,480
It is said that 'marriages
are made in heaven'.

1202
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:29,720
Everything is God's grace.

1203
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,350
Forget it...
Come on in... Come...

1204
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:33,850
Come... Everything is God's grace.

1205
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,350
-Hey, listen.
-What is it?

1206
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,670
Do you know who has come
to see our daughter?

1207
01:04:38,330 --> 01:04:41,370
Six years ago, a boy and his friends
were behind our daughter at Ameerpet,

1208
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:43,950
And I have bashed them by
taking them to the station.

1209
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:47,300
The guy who liked our daughter by
seeing her braid? Is he the one?

1210
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:49,680
Yes, he is the one who is
here to see our daughter.

1211
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:51,210
Come... Come...

1212
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:54,050
-I told you initially not to bring me here
-It's just a formality.

1213
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:54,830
Mother...

1214
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,980
You have chided me six
years ago asking me,

1215
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:02,220
"Why have you terribly bashed those
boys by taking them to your station?"

1216
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:05,880
Yeah, the guy who liked our girl
by seeing her braid, six years ago.

1217
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:09,770
The same guy is here as our
Bhagyamathi's husband to be.

1218
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,060
Oh, he is the one?

1219
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:13,360
Address him as son-in-law.

1220
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:23,920
Look, the son-in-law is here.

1221
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:27,290
Why have you stopped there? Come here.

1222
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:32,910
Come...

1223
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:37,590
Mother, the guy is here. Look at him.

1224
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,400
Son-in-law, my daughter is in her room.

1225
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,650
-She'll be overwhelming if she sees you.
-Satya, come here.

1226
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:51,250
-Come...
-Yes, coming.

1227
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,090
-Come... Don't be hesitant.
-What's up?

1228
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:54,970
-Come...
-Tell me.

1230
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:24,500
Hi

1231
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:25,580
Hi, Madhav.

1232
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:27,620
Why have you stopped there? Come on in.

1233
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,830
-I have already seen you a while ago.
-Is it?

1234
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:34,060
How are you doing?

1235
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:34,920
I am doing good.

1236
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:35,880
Please sit.

1237
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:49,980
I am sorry.

1238
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:52,590
What for?

1239
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:54,990
Because my daddy has terribly
whacked you at that time.

1240
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:56,870
No problem. I don't remember it now.

1241
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:01,130
You don't remember me as well.

1242
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,280
That's why I have come here
unexpectedly for matchmaking.

1243
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,640
Yeah, you don't remember.

1244
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:12,130
The guy doesn't remember
it. I don't remember it.

1245
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:13,410
Everyone has forgotten
about that incident.

1246
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:16,000
If God's has written the destiny,
there would be nothing we could do.

1247
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:19,260
Strangely, the same guy has come
to my house for matchmaking.

1248
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,880
Not just matchmaking, but the wedding too
is almost fixed. It'd be in two months.

1249
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,280
I never expected this.

1250
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,450
Did you really love
for real, at that time?

1251
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:37,260
At that age, that was...

1252
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:43,930
Unexpectedly, it was...

1253
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:57,010
Mother, sister and brother-in-law
have been laughing and talking.

1254
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,510
Sister likes brother-in-law.

1255
01:07:58,710 --> 01:07:59,720
It's not new that she likes him now.

1256
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:02,070
She was already fond of him six years ago.

1257
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:04,870
Our Bhagyamathi is very fortunate.

1258
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,850
The girl and the guy were
already in love with each other.

1259
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:10,380
Our son-in-law has a golden heart.

1260
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:27,460
Granny, this match is okay.

Where are you?

I am on the way to home.

1267
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,220
Did you leave him there?

1268
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:17,580
As if he is a kid that
he doesn't know the way.

1269
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,730
Alright. Since today is your birthday,

1270
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:21,980
enjoy with your friends
for this day and come home.

1271
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:24,090
But from tomorrow, you have to obey me.

1272
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:25,540
Do you remember that you
have promised me about it?

1273
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:27,420
One minute.

1274
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:44,380
Why wait till tomorrow?
Let me tell you now.

1275
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,520
I am looking forward for the wedding.

1276

Really?

1277
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,250
Ask Rakesh to call me.

Aunty, it is me. Satya...

Ultimately, congratulations to you.

1287
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,360
You are going to marry the
girl you fell in love with.

1288

Can you give phone to Satya?

1289

She is not home yet.
Today is her birthday.

1290
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,100
She has been to a pub with her friends.

1291

Pub? Which pub?

1292
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,070
I think it's Zehn pub.

01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:07,770
Hi, shall we start cake cutting?

1388
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,280
-[in unison] Happy birthday, Satya.
-Thank you.

1389
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:18,400
-Okay, bye. Bye, Rakesh.-Bye, Satya.

1390
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,810
Bye, Rakesh.

1391
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,330
Oh! Your birthday too
is on this day, right?

1392
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,310
Happy birthday.

1393
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:52,470
This is for you.

1394
01:17:57,310 --> 01:17:58,230
All the best!

1395
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:23,720
Wake up! Enough of
sleeping. Satya, wake up.

1396
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:24,410
Mom!

1397
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:25,780
Where is your phone?

1398
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,130
What's it for you to do with my phone?

1399
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:30,280
Check how many times your
mother-in-law to be called you?

1400
01:18:30,730 --> 01:18:32,250
As you didn't answer, she called me.

1401
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:33,120
What's the matter?

1402
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:34,500
She wants to talk to you.

1403
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:38,050
Roaming around all day
and sleeping till noon!

1404
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:42,500
If you be like this even after your
wedding, I'll be blamed, not you.

1405
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:47,030
Nice ring!

1406
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:48,860
Who gave it?

1407
01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:51,140
Someone gave it, alright!

1408
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:53,590
Okay. Take shower and get ready.

1409
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:02,600
[phone ringing]

1410
01:19:03,790 --> 01:19:06,720
-Hello.
-Hi daughter-in-law, how are you doing?

1411
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:08,610
Greetings, aunt.

1412
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:11,210
Call me mother-in-law, not aunt.

1413
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,240
Sorry, mother-in-law. I'll do as you say.

1414
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:16,210
Well dear, I forgot to wish you on your
birthday due to my shooting schedule.

1415
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:17,500
Belated happy birthday.

1416
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:18,720
Thank you, mother-in-law.

1417
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:21,330
Rakesh would arrive to
the city in 2-3 days.

1418
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,720
In the meantime, shall we both
go for engagement shopping?

1419
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:25,940
Okay, mother-in-law.

1420
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,510
Just a minute, man.
I'm talking to my daughter-in-law.

1421
01:19:28,590 --> 01:19:29,400
Tell him I am coming.

1422
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:33,100
Okay, dear. I'll check my shooting
time and tell you when I am free.

1423
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,690
Then, we shall both go for shopping. Okay?

1424
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,360
-Okay, mother-in-law.
-Bye.

1425
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:47,810
Wake up. You are in slumber as if
you have achieved something great.

1426
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:50,490
When you for matchmaking, you have
to just see the girl and come home.

1427
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:51,740
Should you have to okay the right there?

1428
01:19:52,030 --> 01:19:53,730
You didn't even have the
sense to tell us about it.

1429
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,510
Drat!

1430
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,730
Alright! He loved her at one point of
time. He went there and okayed her.

1431
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:58,790
Why make a fuzz about it?

1432
01:19:58,930 --> 01:20:01,430
Hey, go and get ready.
Your father-in-law is coming here.

1433
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:02,230
Which father-in-law?

1434
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:04,800
Didn't you know which father-in-law it was
when you went there and okayed the girl?

1435
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,870
Well, your father-in-law who is
an ACP is arriving. Get ready.

1436
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,230
You too get ready.

1437
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:13,560
Perfect! When everything is decided
by you, what's there for me?

1438
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:17,850
You aren't even ashamed even after
he bashed you by making you strip.

1439
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:18,400
Drat!

1440
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:24,400
Where is the ring?

1441
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:28,520
Oh! You have okayed the girl
as well as wore her the ring.

1442
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:29,050
-Damn!
-Ow!

1443
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:30,820
If this is the case now,

1444
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:32,370
-imagine what you'd do after the marriage.
-Mom... Mom...

1445
01:20:32,570 --> 01:20:33,200
Listen to me.

1446
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:34,920
What will you tell and what will I listen?

1447
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,420
I said okay to ACP's daughter
not because I liked her.

1448
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:40,610
Then?

1449
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:42,990
How is life?

1450
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:45,570
-Can you give your phone once?
-Yeah, sure.

1451
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,700
-I'll make a phone call.
-Sure, no problem.

1452
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:50,580
Thank you.

1453
01:20:57,470 --> 01:21:00,340
Kasi, where are you?

1454
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:05,710
Please, Kasi. Every day, a guy is
coming to see me for matchmaking.

1455
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:09,540
-Please, Kasi. Kasi...
-Bhagya...

1456
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:13,140
Hey, what happened? Why are you crying?

1457
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:17,500
Madhav, I want to tell you something.

1458
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:20,830
I am in love.

1459
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:25,850
Love? What's with this
matchmaking and drama?

1460
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,270
You know about my father, don't you?

1461
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:30,970
He's making me go
nowhere due to suspicion.

1462
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:33,290
He is not giving my
cell phone to me as well.

1463
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:35,400
Who knows well about
your father other than me?

1464
01:21:35,650 --> 01:21:36,840
I was the one who got bashed up, right?

1465
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:37,830
Wait... Wait...

1466
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:40,580
Every day, a guy is
coming to see me for matchmaking.

1467
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:43,210
I am unable to understand
what to do, Madhav.

1468
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:46,020
On the contrary,
shall I talk with your father about it?

1469
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:49,390
Whatever you tell them now, this
would get known to all of them.

1470
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:51,470
They will never accept.

1471
01:21:51,770 --> 01:21:53,790
Tomorrow, another guy
would come to see me.

1472
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:56,610
If he okays me, my parents would
fix the wedding immediately.

1473
01:21:56,810 --> 01:21:58,750
Do something, Madhav. Please.

1474
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:00,110
What can I do?

1475
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:01,730
I don't understand!

1476
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:03,210
Do something.

1477
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,350
-Go out and say yes.
-Hey!

1478
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:06,950
Are you mad?

1479
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:09,140
You are in love with another guy and,
should I say yes to our marriage?

1480
01:22:09,610 --> 01:22:10,660
No chance!

1481
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:13,530
Please, Madhav! Madhav, please.

1482
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:16,060
-Try to understand me know. Please...
-Please... Please...

1483
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:17,110
Don't force me, please.

1484
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:20,940
If you say no to me,
they will find some other guy.

1485
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:22,080
What can I do now?

1486
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,180
That's why say okay to this marriage.

1487
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:24,960
Just okay.

1488
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:26,370
After that, you take me out

1489
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:27,720
-and I'll elope.
-Hey!

1490
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:30,560
-Will you elope?
-Yes.

1491
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:34,070
Oh no! Your dad!

1492
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:35,990
I can't do this. No... No...

1493
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:37,730
-Please... Please... Please...
-Please... Please... Please...

1494
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,030
Behave as if you don't know anything.

1495
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,550
I don't actually know anything.
Please I don't know anything.

1496
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:42,980
I will be the one who is going to elope.

1497
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:45,150
And I will be the one
who would get whacked.

1498
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,860
Please Madhav!

1499
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:49,040
Only you can do this.

1500
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:51,490
Who else can I ask for this help?

1501
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:53,060
You are terribly trapping me.

1502
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:56,800
You did love me at one
point of time, didn't you?

1503
01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:57,630
That's my ill-fate!

1504
01:22:57,690 --> 01:22:59,480
Only you can understand my pain.

1505
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:03,330
Whoa! The girl seems to
be like a troublemaker.

1506
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:05,630
How dare she seeks help of yours
who has been for matchmaking?

1507
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,640
Whatever!
We got a good riddance of ill-fate!

1508
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:10,870
Mom, tell this to no one.

1509
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,320
Moreover, no news stay in your mouth.

1510
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:14,330
Damn! As if this is
something to be told to others.

1511
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:16,780
Get rid of her within two days.

1512
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:20,980
I'll find another wedding match
which would be far better than this.

1513
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:30,900
If I give birth to a male kid,

1514
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:32,500
-I'll name him after you.
-Hey!

1515
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:36,930
What if it is a female kid?

1516
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:39,490
I'll name her after your wife.

1517
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:42,620
Name her Satyabhama.

1518
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:44,250
-Satyabhama?
-Yes.

1519
01:23:44,630 --> 01:23:45,490
Who is Satyabhama?

1520
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:49,940
My fiance.

1521
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:51,430
Fiance.

1522
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:55,290
Why didn't Satya tell this before?

1523
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:58,330
Is it true?

1524
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,380
If I somehow meet Satya...

1525
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,200
-Dad
-Hmm.

1526
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:11,320
I am sorry.

1527
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:13,740
Why sorry?

1528
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:15,670
I've drunk beer.

1529
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:18,340
This was my first time
and the last time as well.

1530
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:19,540
I promise.

1531
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:21,720
It's okay.

1532
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:25,400
Nice ring!

1533
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,580
Who gave it to you?

1534
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,750
Any magic happened on your birthday?

1535
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:32,520
Nothing.

1536
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:36,910
[phone ringing]

1537
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:40,600
Who is it?

1538
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:42,530
Waste call.

1539
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:45,310
[phone ringing]

1540
01:24:45,650 --> 01:24:47,280
Yes, son.

1541
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:49,230
Satya? Should I give her any message?

1542
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:52,160
Well... Err... I have to talk to Satya.

1543
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,400
Tell me, son. It's okay.

1544
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:55,700
-Nothing, aunt.-Tell me what it is.

1545
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:57,800
Satya has my ring.

1546
01:24:57,940 --> 01:24:58,620
Damn!

1547
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:00,950
Give me a minute. I'll call you again.

1548
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:02,360
Crap! I'm gone!

1549
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:05,620
How did you get that ring?

1550
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:07,140
Which one?

1551
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:07,870
Show me.

1552
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:08,940
How did you get that ring?

1553
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,370
Does it belong to Sunnipenta's son?

1554
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:12,490
Have you got any shame?

1555
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,210
How can you wear a ring of the
guy who came for matchmaking?

1556
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:16,080
Mom! I didn't keep it intentionally.

1557
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:17,050
It got stuck.

1558
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:18,370
Why would it get stuck?

1559
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:19,750
-Give me.
-Mom!

1560
01:25:20,210 --> 01:25:21,400
You have dented our reputation.

1561
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:25,630
He's been calling me for
this ring. And this is stuck.

1562
01:25:26,170 --> 01:25:29,440
-What? Did he call you about the ring?
-Yes.

1563
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:31,640
-Wait, where are you going?
-He'll die in my hands!

1564
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:39,250
[phone rings]

1565
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:41,900
Satya.

1566
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:43,420
Have you got any sense?

1567
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:45,370
Will you call my mom for a mere ring?

1568
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:46,890
Can't you wait for a day?

1569
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:48,790
Will I run away with your ring?

1570
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:50,720
Hey... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1571
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,940
Alright. Come to Kavanah
restaurant at 11 am.

1572
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:54,060
I'll throw this ring on your face.

1573
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:55,000
Be there by sharp 11.

1574
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:56,510
I have to go to shopping later. Okay?

1575
01:25:58,850 --> 01:25:59,700
Hello... Hello...

1576
01:25:59,790 --> 01:26:01,050
-Okay.-Another thing.

1577
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:02,900
Pay my commission amount
immediately. I need it.

1578
01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:03,750
What commission amount?

1579
01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:05,490
The marriage is not yet fixed.
Should it be paid so early?

1580
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:06,440
Of course, it is inevitable.

1581
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,830
You did happily latch to her like a
lizard upon seeing her, didn't you?

1582
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:11,370
Okay, bye.

1583
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:25,020
This is for you.

1584
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:26,370
Happy birthday.

1585
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:28,340
Idiot!

1586
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:37,530
Greetings, father-in-law.
Greetings, mother-in-law.

1587
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:38,910
-Who is he?
-Mother-in-law?

1588
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:40,610
I am Srinivas Rao.

1589
01:26:41,210 --> 01:26:43,150
My fans call me Senapathi.

1590
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:44,650
Isn't brother-in-law home?

1591
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:45,940
Brother-in-law?
Who is your brother-in-law?

1592
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,420
There he is.
How are you doing, brother-in-law?

1593
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:49,340
Who the hell is he?

1594
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:52,240
I've been to three match makings.
He is from the second party.

1595
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:54,180
I liked brother-in-law very much.

1596
01:26:54,930 --> 01:26:56,460
And he too liked my sister very much.

1597
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:57,560
Didn't you tell her?

1598
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:59,590
Ah! Brother-in-law is very shy!

1599
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:02,270
What are you staring at? Come on in.

1600
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,770
We have seen the girl just yesterday.

1601
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:07,440
Give us two days time to think.

1602
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,840
If not two days, take four days.
What's there in that, father-in-law?

1603
01:27:09,990 --> 01:27:10,770
Think well!

1604
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,460
I liked brother-in-law and he
too likes my sister. That's it!

1605
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:15,000
Have I told you that I liked your sister?

1606
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:16,700
[phone ringing] Bro,
the minister is calling.

1607
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:18,090
It's the minister.

1608
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:19,630
He says minister's phone call.

1609
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:20,860
How are you doing, minister?

1610
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:23,930
Yes, I am conducting my
sister's wedding in this month.

1611
01:27:25,330 --> 01:27:27,780
Not five days, but it is a
seven days ceremony, minister.

1612
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:30,820
He looks like a hero.
Do you want to see him?

1613
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:32,280
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1614
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:34,930
Look, the minister wants to see you.

1615
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:36,390
-Come.
-He wants a selfie.

1616
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:37,750
Awe!

1617
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,240
Sit, brother-in-law. Sit... Sit.

1618
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:42,800
Didn't I ask you for two days of time?

1619
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:46,770
Brother-in-law, any doubt?

1620
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:48,870
-Err...
-Hey!

1621
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,460
Brother-in-law, this is a blank cheque.

1622
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,500
Write as much amount as you want.

1623
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:01,510
I am ready to give up all my
properties for the sake of my sister.

1624
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:04,930
I liked you. That's it.

1625
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:07,660
Drive.

1626
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:08,760
See you, mother-in-law.

1627
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:13,050
Mom, why are you okaying him?

1628
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:14,780
He gave a blank cheque, son.

1629
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,690
-He says he will buy so many sarees.
-Mom, please.

1630
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:18,840
-Okay. Okay.
-But I like this wedding match.

1631
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:20,340
We have arrived.
We have arrived.

1632
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,450
-Greetings, brother-in-law and sister.
-Greetings... Greetings...

1633
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:25,050
-Have you been waiting for me?
-Yes.

1634
01:28:25,290 --> 01:28:28,020
Madam, I am holding these
hands to seek forgiveness.

1635
01:28:28,110 --> 01:28:29,920
I didn't bash your son
intentionally at that time.

1636
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:31,490
Out of anger and aggression,

1637
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:34,850
I have bashed him in a way
that he peed in his pants.

1638
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,240
And that incident was
forgotten by your son and me.

1639
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,300
You too forget it.
You too forget it, brother-in-law.

1640
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:40,060
Let's all forget that.

1641
01:28:40,150 --> 01:28:42,320
Regardless of whoever forgets it,
you are there to remind about it.

1642
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:44,990
You keep reminding about it by asking
us to forget about the incident.

1643
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:46,740
She's kidding! Shall we go inside?

1644
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:47,880
-Come in.
-Let's go.

1645
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:49,070
Let's all forget about it.

1646
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:53,850
Mom, I'll take Bhagya out.

1647
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:54,680
Ask them, please.

1648
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:55,800
-Please.
-Shut up!

1649
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:57,000
What's your son saying?

1650
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:59,680
My son wants to go out with your daughter.

1651
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:02,210
There's a lot of time to
roam around jollily, sister.

1652
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:04,000
Moreover, the days are not really good.

1653
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:05,370
Let's exchange rings first.

1654
01:29:05,450 --> 01:29:07,590
Also, I have kept the shopping
programme for the day after.

1655
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:09,490
Both of you can roam
around jollily over there.

1656
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:11,630
Hey, you saw her yesterday, right?

1657
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:12,790
What's the hurry?

1658
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,180
Nothing like that, daddy.

1659
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,240
Son, come with me.
I'll take you to my home.

1660
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:19,410
Both of you can have good
conversations at my home.

1661
01:29:19,570 --> 01:29:21,380
And they'll be in front of our eyes.

1662
01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:22,960
What do you say, brother-in-law?

1663
01:29:23,890 --> 01:29:26,710
Now, I got urgent crime-meeting.

1664
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:28,830
Let's meet on the day after.
Where? In the shopping mall.

1665
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,880
See you, sister.
See you, brother-in-law.

1666
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:38,100
Bhagya boyfriend Kasi.

1667
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:41,340
-Hello.-I am Madhav.

1668
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:43,060
I went to attend a
matchmaking yesterday.

1669
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,740
What do you mean?

1670
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:46,180
Listen to me completely.

1671
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:47,550
I went to attend a
matchmaking yesterday.

1672
01:29:47,810 --> 01:29:48,790
Do you know the girl?

1673
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:50,530
Your lover Bhagya.

1674
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:51,710
My lover Bhagya.

1675
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:52,880
Did she say okay?

1676
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,550
No, she didn't but I did.

1677
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,650
Bro! This is cheating.
How can you do that

1678
01:29:56,750 --> 01:30:00,120
-despite she being another guy's lover?
-Hey... I said okay not for my sake.

1679
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:01,310
I did that to unite her with you.

1680
01:30:01,790 --> 01:30:02,650
Try to understand.

1681
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:04,440
Well bro, what shall we do now?

1682
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:06,370
I'll bring Bhagya out in two days.

1683
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:07,590
Both of you elope then.

1684
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:10,480
Bro... Bro... Bro...

1685
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,990
Now, you are like a God to me.

1686
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:12,870
I'll come.

1687
01:30:27,950 --> 01:30:29,060
Sunnipenta.

1688
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,040
Nice last name.

1689
01:30:32,570 --> 01:30:33,240
Did you like it?

1690
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:39,090
Did you just like the last
name or even Ghazni?

1691
01:30:40,670 --> 01:30:42,450
Whatever you want to ask, ask me straight.

1692
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:45,640
Last night...

1693
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:53,960
Ghazni Sunnipenta has completely
spoiled my birthday, Papa.

1694
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:59,600
He made me crazy within one day.

1695
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:01,900
So, a magic has happened.

1696
01:31:03,730 --> 01:31:04,680
Yes.

1697
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,320
I don't know what happened to me.

1698
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:10,910
In those few hours,
I just got carried away.

1699
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:14,660
It never happened like this before.

1700
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:16,940
But there is no mistake of his.

1701
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:22,520
He came for matchmaking and went
to the girl who he once loved.

1702
01:31:23,630 --> 01:31:24,680
And he okayed her too.

1703
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:27,020
That's magic.

1704
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:28,870
But mine is madness.

1705
01:31:32,210 --> 01:31:34,040
Is it why you have okayed Rakesh?

1706
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:38,810
I'll anyway forget this.

1707
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:40,850
Don't worry.

1708
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:43,660
But don't tell mom.

1709
01:31:57,740 --> 01:31:58,460
Ahem.

1710
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,020
Do you want Kulfi?

1711
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:03,950
-Bro...
-I don't want.

1712
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:06,430
How much did you spend for the ring?

1713
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:07,450
What?

1714
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:09,370
How much did you spend for the ring?

1715
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:14,010
Thirty... Forty...

1716
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:15,760
Thirty-forty.

1717
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,400
Is it 30K or 40K?

1718
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:20,040
40K it is.

1719
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:24,180
The receipt is at my home.

1720
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:30,550
I have only 30K. And the rest of the
amount, deduct from my commission.

1721
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:32,030
Won't you give my ring back?

1722
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:34,250
See, I've tried so hard
but still, it is stuck.

1723
01:32:34,430 --> 01:32:36,260
Bloody ring! What can I do? Should I die?

1724
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:40,300
Don't do name callings for the ring.

1725
01:32:40,490 --> 01:32:41,820
I bought it for my wife to be.

1726
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:45,730
He's got no dearth of silly sayings!

1727
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,980
Hey... Satya, please...

1728
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:49,650
Hey Satya

1729
01:32:49,710 --> 01:32:50,750
-[phone rings] Hey!
-Please... Please...

1730
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:51,960
-I want to--
-Whatever you talk...

1731
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:54,140
Should you tell that you have
bought for your wife to be?

1732
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,270
As if you bought Kohinoor diamond.

1733
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:57,430
A big show off!

1734
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:59,830
Don't make a fuss here
for your stupid ring.

1735
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:01,750
[phone rings] Satya, please.
I need to talk to you.

1736
01:33:03,090 --> 01:33:04,840
I came here not because to chat with you.

1737
01:33:05,070 --> 01:33:06,570
I'll give your ring to you. Just come.

1738
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:08,890
[phone ringing] Please...
I need to talk to you.

1739
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:11,400
First, answer the call.

1740
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:13,960
-Hello-Hello, husband.

1741
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:14,740
Who is it?

1742
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:17,750
-It's me.-Who is it?

1743
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:20,340
Hello husband, did you forget me already?

1744
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:21,690
-It's me Gomathi.
-Gomathi?

1745
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:25,190
Gomathi? Senapathi?

1746
01:33:25,570 --> 01:33:28,190
Wow! You remember my
brother's name so well.

1747
01:33:29,190 --> 01:33:31,290
Of course, your brother-in-law
gave you a blank cheque.

1748
01:33:32,970 --> 01:33:34,310
When are you taking me to shopping?

1749
01:33:34,770 --> 01:33:36,040
Shopping? What shopping?

1750
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:37,730
Why? Won't you take me?

1751
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:39,310
Gomathi, listen to me.

1752
01:33:39,890 --> 01:33:41,250
I want to tell you one important matter.

1753
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:45,560
Just one? Take me to shopping,
I'll tell you several things.

1754
01:33:46,010 --> 01:33:47,160
That's not the case, Gomathi.

1755
01:33:47,810 --> 01:33:50,560
Actually, I didn't take any
decision about marriage.

1756
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,430
I need some time.

1757
01:33:52,770 --> 01:33:55,120
Take it. Take as much time as you want.

1758
01:33:55,790 --> 01:33:56,930
Meanwhile, we'll go for shopping.

1759
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:00,700
-That's not the case, Gomathi.-Hello husband, listen to me.

1760
01:34:01,130 --> 01:34:03,490
Having food at my home means
our wedding night is over.

1761
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:05,190
You ate your stomach full, didn't you?

1762
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:06,590
I liked you.

1763
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:08,320
You took a blank cheque as well.

1764
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,070
That's it! That's the matter.

1765
01:34:10,370 --> 01:34:13,090
Come to my home and take me for shopping.

1766
01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:13,680
Bye.

1767
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:18,500
Why is she connecting eating
food with wedding night?

1768
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:20,590
You are to be blamed for all this!

1769
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:22,620
The other day you ate your
stomach full over there.

1770
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:23,950
His brother came and gave a blank cheque.

1771
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:25,480
And this girl is connecting
eating food with wedding night.

1772
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:28,320
What did I do?

1773
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:31,220
I got many works.

1774
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:34,430
Hello, why are you leaving?

1775
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:35,730
Have you got no responsibility?

1776
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:38,290
And for this, you call it a marriage
bureau and seek commissions.

1777
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:41,330
Hello, we take commissions
for fixing a wedding.

1778
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:42,370
-But not to ruin them.
-Is it?

1779
01:34:42,630 --> 01:34:43,860
Let me talk to your mother.

1780
01:34:44,690 --> 01:34:45,680
Stop!

1781
01:34:46,090 --> 01:34:48,020
Alright! Get two packets of biryani.

1782
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:50,300
I'll hit the biryani on their faces.

1783
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:52,180
Did you eat two packets of biryani?

1784
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:04,490
Is your nuptial with
Rakesh a love marriage?

1785
01:35:05,050 --> 01:35:07,170
Yes! Very deep love! So what?

1786
01:35:10,730 --> 01:35:11,870
Why do you want to get married?

1787
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:13,610
What?

1788
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:16,960
Well, you asked me why I was marrying.

1789
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:18,420
Why are you marrying?

1790
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:19,780
For sex.

1791
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:23,270
What?

1792
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:25,980
Yeah. For safe sex.

1793
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:28,670
What? Should I illustrate more?

1794
01:35:29,530 --> 01:35:30,630
Okay, listen.

1795
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:33,850
After my wedding,
I have to become a mother.

1796
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:35,420
After that...

1797
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:40,680
I have to become grandmother,
granny and nanny to my kids' kids.

1798
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:41,990
After that, I have to die.

1799
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:45,700
To get those all things done,
marriage is the only option.

1800
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:50,030
-Okay.
-Okay? Understood?

1801
01:35:51,270 --> 01:35:53,360
-Sit.
-To hell with your stupid questions. Drive!

1802
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:56,760
Start the vehicle.

1803
01:35:59,350 --> 01:36:00,050
One second.

1804
01:36:03,650 --> 01:36:04,240
What happened?

1805
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:07,170
Seems like my bike too got
scared for the shock you gave.

1806
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,770
Oh crap!

1807
01:36:11,990 --> 01:36:13,580
-Hey Madhav!
-Yes.

1808
01:36:14,610 --> 01:36:15,200
Him?

1809
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:17,320
-Hey, take to them carefully.
-Him?

1810
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,240
What? Going for matchmaking again?

1811
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:28,450
Anyhow, matchmaking and
arranged marriages don't suit you.

1812
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:33,200
Madam, I told you yesterday

1813
01:36:33,810 --> 01:36:35,140
that his tastes are different.

1814
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:38,480
At least, show him a girl like you,

1815
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:39,890
he will be showing off.

1816
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:41,320
What do you say, dude?

1817
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,530
I'll ask to shut up.

1818
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,300
By the way, where are we going?

1819
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:46,540
To Senapathi's home.

1820
01:36:47,790 --> 01:36:50,720
I know Chatrapathi.
But who is this Senapathi?

1821
01:36:51,210 --> 01:36:52,040
My husband!

1822
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:56,020
[camera clicks]
[gate creaks]

1823
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:00,510
Hey, your husband is here.

1824
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,210
Wow! He came right away upon calling.

1825
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:06,870
-Come... Come...
-Come, dude.

1826
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:08,150
What, dude?

1827
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:09,570
This seems like the den of thugs?

1828
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:10,480
Come.

1829
01:37:14,910 --> 01:37:16,140
What happened to the
land case at Vikarabad?

1830
01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:17,690
-Almost settled.
-Brother.

1831
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:18,530
-Just signing the documents is left.
-Dear.

1832
01:37:18,610 --> 01:37:19,410
My husband is here.

1833
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:20,680
He wants to take me to shopping.

1834
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:23,360
-Is it? Go.
-Aunt, come. Come quickly.

1835
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:24,450
Get ready quickly.

1836
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:27,050
Hey brother-in-law, come.

1837
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:29,160
How are you doing?

1838
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:30,580
How are you doing, dear?

1839
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,450
Heard that you are taking
my sister for shopping.

1840
01:37:34,150 --> 01:37:35,700
Come... Come, sit. Come.

1841
01:37:40,410 --> 01:37:41,670
What happened, brother-in-law?
Do you have something to say?

1842
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,140
Give that cheque.

1843
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:55,890
What's this brother-in-law?

1844
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:59,910
Actually, he didn't take any decision yet.

1845
01:38:00,430 --> 01:38:04,240
In the meantime, you went to his
home and gave a blank cheque.

1846
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:08,870
We came here... to tell this to you.

1847
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:16,960
Move aside... Just move.

1848
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:18,250
-Uh-uh
-Move.

1849
01:38:20,930 --> 01:38:21,770
What's this, dude?

1850
01:38:23,210 --> 01:38:24,780
I want to conduct this
marriage in seven days.

1851
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:26,070
I've informed the Minister as well.

1852
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:28,620
I gave you a blank cheque asking
you to take off all the properties.

1853
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:32,360
You came for matchmaking, had lunch and,
now you say you don't want to get married?

1854
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:34,870
I was the one who compelled
him to have lunch.

1855
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:36,670
I am very fond of Biryani.

1856
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:39,600
I've got tempted by the
aroma of Biryani in your house.

1857
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:43,290
You thought that we liked
your girl since we had food.

1858
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:45,410
Anyhow, he won't suit your family.

1859
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:50,420
His horoscope states that he'd
marry a girl elder than him.

1860
01:38:50,630 --> 01:38:51,780
Is my horoscope really important now?

1861
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:52,780
Shut up!

1862
01:38:54,050 --> 01:38:56,900
Your family background and his
family background are different.

1863
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,900
You are a tough guy and he is soft.

1864
01:38:59,090 --> 01:39:01,520
Moreover, you are
non-vegetarian and he is a vegetarian.

1865
01:39:01,690 --> 01:39:05,300
-He doesn't even booze.
-Hey, you stopped boozing?

1866
01:39:05,390 --> 01:39:06,220
When did that happen?

1867
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:11,050
Do you booze?

1868
01:39:12,830 --> 01:39:13,540
Tell me the truth.

1869
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:16,530
He was the one who taught us how to booze.

1870
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:17,770
Didn't you tell her?

1871
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:20,980
You said you were a teetotaller?

1872
01:39:21,730 --> 01:39:23,540
Does it mean all your words were lies?

1873
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:25,880
He's got a habit of lying to girls.

1874
01:39:26,270 --> 01:39:27,960
Maybe he did that to impress you.

1875
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:28,790
That's what it is, right?

1876
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:30,820
What's with impressing her?

1877
01:39:31,130 --> 01:39:33,740
Yes, I do booze. So what?

1878
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:36,130
Should you point the gun at me and ask
if you are Thupakula (Guns) Satyabhama?

1879
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:37,150
Enough. Put it down.

1880
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:38,490
Anyway, it was you who told that

1881
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:41,380
your father boozes and wants a
son-in-law who'd give company to him.

1882
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:43,620
She too got completely drunk yesterday.

1883
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:45,330
-She too?
-Yes, I did get drunk.

1884
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:47,850
I got mad due to going
with you and got drunk.

1885
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:49,350
You are a rogue.

1886
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:51,410
Rogue? If a person drinks,
does it make him a rogue?

1887
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:52,670
That means, you too are a rogue.
Your father too is a rogue.

1888
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:54,430
-Excuse me, mind your tongue.
-Hey! Shut up!

1889
01:39:57,460 --> 01:40:00,800
You saw him, right?
He speaks nothing but lies.

1890
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:02,930
Characterless fellow!

1891
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:06,730
I apologize to you for getting
a person like him to your house.

1892
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:09,400
I'll get a better
wedding alliance than this.

1893
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:11,740
Brother.

1894
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:22,690
So, you got to know many things
about Madhav in just one day.

1895
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:26,200
And he lied to you impress you as well?

1896
01:40:27,470 --> 01:40:29,720
What's actually happening
between both of you?

1897
01:40:29,890 --> 01:40:35,280
What? Between both of us?
Sister, do you know his character?

1898
01:40:35,450 --> 01:40:36,470

01:51:12,230 --> 01:51:14,190
Sir... Sir... Ow!

2071
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:16,000
Almost gone!

2072
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:21,350
-Satya... Satya...
-Hey, stop. Stop.

2073
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:24,410
-What happened?
-She swallowed finger-ring.

2074
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:26,550
Is she your wife?

2075
01:51:28,570 --> 01:51:29,980
-No, I was saying the same.
-Oh!

2076
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:32,100
Come, take... Take fast.

2077
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:33,950
-Satya, nothing would happen. Be cool.
-[coughs]

2078
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:42,820
[phone ringing]

2079
01:51:43,810 --> 01:51:44,490
Mom.

2080
01:51:44,690 --> 01:51:45,400
Where are you?

2081
01:51:45,890 --> 01:51:47,930
They have already
started to the shopping mall.

2082
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:49,420
I am going there.

2083
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:51,560
-When will you come?
-I'll come directly to the mall.

2084
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:52,450
You start now.

2085
01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:54,250
-You won't be late, would you?
-I'll come, mom.

2086
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:01,590
-Madhav.
-Aunt.

2087
01:52:07,230 --> 01:52:08,090
No need to worry.

2088
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:10,180
You are safe, okay? Take care.

2089
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:13,160
She is alright. You can take her now.

2090
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:15,650
Thank you. Thank you, doctor.
What's all this, dear?

2091
01:52:16,790 --> 01:52:18,360
How come you swallowed a ring?

2092
01:52:19,110 --> 01:52:20,240
Are you mad?

2093
01:52:20,350 --> 01:52:22,210
Madam, here is the ring
that you have swallowed.

2094
01:52:25,130 --> 01:52:26,190
Enough of your doing!

2095
01:52:26,980 --> 01:52:28,640
I asked you to give that ring
to that guy and you swallowed it?

2096
01:52:28,940 --> 01:52:29,570
Yech!

2097
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:32,640
What's with these kids?

2098
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:34,320
I will give the ring to him.

2099
01:52:59,950 --> 01:53:01,290
Look, the son-in-law too is here.

2100
01:53:01,590 --> 01:53:03,370
Be here and talk jollily.

2101
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:06,550
There won't be any jolly if we
stay right in front of them, brother.

2102
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,950
Take the girl and go for shopping.

2103
01:53:09,070 --> 01:53:10,640
Buy all those you like.

2104
01:53:10,830 --> 01:53:12,150
-Let's meet in an hour.
-Hmm.

2105
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:12,770
Come.

2106
01:53:12,970 --> 01:53:15,970
-Son-in-law, protect my daughter.
-Dear, protect my son.

2107
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:18,480
Quickly finish the work you
are here for and come back.

2108
01:53:18,710 --> 01:53:20,460
-Okay. Come.
-Let's go... Let's go...

2109
01:53:21,660 --> 01:53:23,500
[phone rings]

2110
01:53:23,580 --> 01:53:25,360
-Kasi, where are you?
-On the first floor, bro.

2111
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:26,510
First floor. Let's go.

2112
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:30,700
Hey bro.

2113
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:32,160
Pathi...
Mathi...

2114
01:53:32,350 --> 01:53:34,040
-Mathi...
-I miss you, Pathi...

2115
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:35,670
-I miss you.
-What's with your Pathi and Mathi mess?

2116
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:39,230
Well, she is Bhagya Mathi
and I am Kasi Pathi.

2117
01:53:39,710 --> 01:53:41,490
Well Mr Pathi, take your Mathi
and leave this place immediately.

2118
01:53:41,550 --> 01:53:42,570
-Thank you very much, bro.
-Go... Go...

2119
01:53:42,770 --> 01:53:43,860
Wait... Wait... Wait...

2120
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:45,480
Thank you so much, Madhav

2121
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:47,820
for helping us despite
my father has bashed you.

2122
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:49,590
-It's okay.
-What's with your daddy bashing him?

2123
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:50,760
Yes, it was in the flashback.

2124
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:51,990
What do you mean by flashback?

2125
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,640
He chased me during intermediate.

2126
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:57,410
Does it mean that you both
already had a love story?

2127
01:53:57,560 --> 01:53:58,820
Not now. It was long ago.

2128
01:53:59,010 --> 01:54:00,020
What do you mean by long ago?

2129
01:54:00,270 --> 01:54:01,620
Why didn't you tell me before?

2130
01:54:01,770 --> 01:54:03,100
Did you hide this from me?

2131
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:04,610
-Kasi...
-You cheated me?

2132
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:06,200
-You cheater!
-Pathi!

2133
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:07,900
To hell with Pathi or Mathi!
You have hidden that from me.

2134
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:10,030
I am very upset with you. Break up!

2135
01:54:10,650 --> 01:54:11,770
Break up?

2136
01:54:12,130 --> 01:54:13,870
What do you mean by break-up?
Have you lost your senses?

2137
01:54:14,050 --> 01:54:15,110
Of course, I am talking about her.

2138
01:54:15,310 --> 01:54:17,130
Hey Pathi, why are you going overboard?

2139
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:19,080
How dare you say break-up?
I too am good with the breakup!

2140
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:20,890
Do you think I have no one for me?

2141
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:21,720
I have Madhav.

2142
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:23,340
-See... See... I already--
-Hey!

2143
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:24,120
Stop this!

2144
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:25,740
Keep calm for a while.

2145
01:54:26,570 --> 01:54:29,050
Kasi, you aren't understanding.

2146
01:54:29,310 --> 01:54:31,230
I know how much she loves you.

2147
01:54:31,970 --> 01:54:35,480
It's been so late. Where are they?

2148
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:41,180
Anyhow, that was during
childhood. And it was an attraction.

2149
01:54:41,370 --> 01:54:43,140
I was the one who chased her, not her.

2150
01:54:43,770 --> 01:54:45,500
-Confirm?
-Yech!

2151
01:54:45,930 --> 01:54:46,970
Go... Go...

2152
01:54:48,370 --> 01:54:51,270
-I hate you, Pathi.
-Mathi... Mathi... I am very sorry, dear.

2153
01:54:51,550 --> 01:54:52,350
It was a mistake.

2154
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:53,620
I love you, dear. I love you.

2155
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:56,690
You are so nice, dear. Do you know how
beautiful you look when you are angry?

2156
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:58,170
I am sorry, Mathi.

2157
01:54:58,270 --> 01:55:00,100
-You know how beautiful your earrings are?
-What's with your romance now?

2158
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:01,680
-Come...
-Bhagya.

2159
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:02,390
Hey!

2160
01:55:04,050 --> 01:55:05,060
She might be here, right?

2161
01:55:06,090 --> 01:55:06,850
Where might have they gone?

2162
01:55:11,670 --> 01:55:12,720
Where did they go?

2163
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,070
Here... Hide here.

2164
01:55:17,770 --> 01:55:18,410
Be here.

2165
01:55:19,470 --> 01:55:22,450
They aren't upstairs or downstairs.
Where might have they been?

2166
01:55:23,050 --> 01:55:25,280
Did he bash you well, bro?

2167
01:55:26,550 --> 01:55:27,290
Hmm.

2168
01:55:28,340 --> 01:55:30,080
He bashed you so hard for chasing her.

2169
01:55:30,190 --> 01:55:32,470
He might kill me in an
encounter for eloping with her.

2170
01:55:32,700 --> 01:55:33,500
What now?

2171
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:36,830
Bro, I'll sacrifice if needed.

2172
01:55:37,450 --> 01:55:39,560
Get married to Bhagya.

2173
01:55:56,130 --> 01:55:57,770
I somehow feel we are doing wrong.

2174
01:55:58,390 --> 01:55:59,530
I'll go and talk to him.

2175
01:55:59,750 --> 01:56:01,220
-Bro, he will kill me.
-Madhav, please...

2176
01:56:01,700 --> 01:56:02,790
Please Madhav.

2177
01:56:03,050 --> 01:56:05,160
Nothing will happen.
I'll try to convince him.

2178
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:06,720
Don't worry.

2179
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:08,970
Bro...

2180
01:56:09,950 --> 01:56:10,620
Bro... Bro...

2181
01:56:12,930 --> 01:56:15,280
-Please forget me.
-Son-in-law, how come you are here?

2182
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:18,280
Uncle, I need to tell you something.

2183
01:56:19,770 --> 01:56:20,460
What is it?

2184
01:56:20,670 --> 01:56:22,460
Bhagya has gone.

2185
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:25,270
Gone?

2186
01:56:25,670 --> 01:56:26,340
With whom?

2187
01:56:26,990 --> 01:56:27,970
Tell me who it was.

2188
01:56:28,090 --> 01:56:29,820
-I'll kill him in an encounter right here.
-Uncle!

2189
01:56:30,670 --> 01:56:32,520
-Uncle, please listen.
-I can't bear this injustice.

2190
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:34,400
How come my daughter is gone?

2191
01:56:34,510 --> 01:56:36,570
Uncle, please think
about what I would say.

2192
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:42,290
I chased Bhagya in the name of love
but she never had feelings for me.

2193
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:44,300
She had feelings for another guy.

2194
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:46,220
She was scared to tell you that

2195
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:50,420
and pleaded for help from every
guy who came for matchmaking.

2196
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:55,630
When a girl is ready to plead anyone

2197
01:56:56,420 --> 01:56:59,330
for the sake of her lover, it means,

2198
01:57:00,590 --> 01:57:01,980
her love has genuinity, uncle.

2199
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:03,710
I am very very sorry, uncle.

2200
01:57:03,990 --> 01:57:06,480
I went to help her,
but realized it was mistake,

2201
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:08,910
and telling you the truth.

2202
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:11,320
Please forgive me, uncle.

2203
01:57:13,530 --> 01:57:16,320
My daughter is very innocent.

2204
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:21,950
I feared that she would get cheated.

2205
01:57:22,630 --> 01:57:23,490
So, I threatened her.

2206
01:57:23,850 --> 01:57:26,090
-Whatever I did...
-Don't cry, Mathi.

2207
01:57:26,190 --> 01:57:28,450
Whatever I did,
I did for the sake of her happiness.

2208
01:57:29,390 --> 01:57:33,310
I can't live without my
daughter. I can't live.

2209
01:57:34,390 --> 01:57:36,760
Tell me where my daughter
is. Tell me where she is.

2210
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:40,180
-Where is she?
-Daddy...

2211
01:57:42,610 --> 01:57:43,710
Please forgive me.

2212
01:57:47,950 --> 01:57:48,640
Who is he?

2213
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:51,090
He is the one Bhagya fell
in love with. He is Kasi.

2214
01:57:51,980 --> 01:57:55,010
I promise to take good
care of Bhagya, uncle.

2215
01:57:55,090 --> 01:57:56,070
Please believe me.

2216
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:04,160
Come, dear.
It's your favourite mutton-head curry.

2217
01:58:04,490 --> 01:58:05,500
Come and eat.

2218
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:07,730
Why does she need that mutton head curry?

2219
01:58:07,970 --> 01:58:09,700
She has my head to eat my brains out.

2220
01:58:10,870 --> 01:58:14,610
You had another guy in mind,
but accepted wedding with my son,

2221
01:58:14,710 --> 01:58:17,450
and wanted to cheat Kotilingaalu
Kanaka Durga which is me?

2222
01:58:17,730 --> 01:58:21,070
You are doing a mistake! You are doing
a mistake! You are doing a mistake!

2223
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:25,530
Why have you switched off
the TV while I was watching?

2224
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:29,890
Your mother-in-law wants to
take you for shopping tomorrow.

2225
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:30,780
Go with her.

2226
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,360
She wants to buy engagement ring.

2227
01:58:33,190 --> 01:58:34,370
I forgot to tell you.

2228
01:58:34,620 --> 01:58:37,520
I was told that SP's daughter has
been in love with another guy.

2229
01:58:37,710 --> 01:58:41,820
She went out for shopping today
and eloped secretly with her lover.

2230
01:58:42,180 --> 01:58:44,070
Yech! What's with these kids?

2231
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:47,770
Poor boy! We have to see another
good wedding alliance for that guy.

2232
01:58:48,950 --> 01:58:50,530
I wonder which girl was destined to him.

2233
01:58:54,180 --> 01:58:58,230
Tomorrow, we shall go to him and
apologize for what had happened.

2234
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:04,090
Don't know! He has okayed her immediately
because he had loved her in the past.

2235
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:11,240
What's with you? If not her,
I'll get you a better match than that.

2236
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,210
I'll conduct your wedding
first, before hers.

2237
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:15,760
Stay for two days and then, leave, dear.

2238
01:59:15,930 --> 01:59:18,110
Mom, please... Don't stop me now.

2239
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:19,080
Listen to me.

2240
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:24,020
I should listen to you and your
father, you won't listen to me.

2241
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:30,780
Hey... Hey... How do you know her?

2242
01:59:31,180 --> 01:59:32,930
How come her video is in your phone?

2243
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:34,290
Tell me.

2244
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:41,540
She is Jaya Aunt's daughter.

2245
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:42,840
Jaya Aunt's daughter?

2246
01:59:44,060 --> 01:59:45,830
She took me for matchmaking.

2247
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:47,130
This girl took you?

2248
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:49,790
I fell in love with her.

2249
01:59:50,270 --> 01:59:51,480
And I wanted to marry her.

2250
01:59:52,180 --> 01:59:53,850
Not just you,

2251
01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:56,240
but I too liked her upon seeing her photo.

2252
01:59:56,490 --> 01:59:58,420
I thought at that very moment
that you too would like her.

2253
01:59:58,670 --> 02:00:02,350
But, Jaya told that her
daughter wouldn't marry so soon.

2254
02:00:02,490 --> 02:00:04,560
-Alright, wait. I'll call Jaya

2255
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:06,080
-and talk--
-Mom, please wait.

2256
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:08,920
I had feelings for Satya,
but not the other way around.

2257
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:11,710
She has no such intention.

2258
02:00:12,290 --> 02:00:13,610
I was the one who imagined wrongly.

2259
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:15,090
Leave it, mom.

2260
02:00:15,380 --> 02:00:16,860
So what? Let's ask them now.

2261
02:00:17,590 --> 02:00:18,420
Mom, please.

2262
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:20,390
They found another wedding match.

2263
02:00:20,900 --> 02:00:21,920
The engagement is in two days.

2264
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:23,620
Kindly forget about all these.

2265
02:00:31,570 --> 02:00:33,450
How would you tell her?

2266
02:00:33,990 --> 02:00:35,740
-Have coffee.
-Thanks.

2267
02:00:38,490 --> 02:00:41,450
We are sorry that your son's
ring was with our daughter.

2268
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:42,520
With your daughter?

2269
02:00:43,450 --> 02:00:45,720
My son bought this
ring with his first salary

2270
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:48,660
to give to his wife to be.

2271
02:00:52,590 --> 02:00:53,920
-Hi uncle.
-Hello.

2272
02:00:54,050 --> 02:00:55,020
-Hi Aunt.
-Hello.

2273
02:00:56,050 --> 02:00:58,330
-How is Satya doing?
-She is doing fine.

2274
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:00,780
Her engagement is in the next week.

2275
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:07,710
Sorry, son. We didn't expect that
ACP's match would end up like that.

2276
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:08,940
It's okay, aunt.

2277
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:11,820
I'll get a better wedding match than that.

2278
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,920
You guys keep talking. I'll be right back.

2279
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:31,720
How is he related to you?

2280
02:01:32,050 --> 02:01:34,310
He is my
brother-in-law and she is my sister.

2281
02:01:35,210 --> 02:01:37,440
They are the biological parents of Madhav.

2282
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:40,290
My sister died after Madhav's birth.

2283
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:45,540
And out of that pain, my brother-in-law
too passed away a few days after that.

2284
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:46,990
I am so sorry.

2285
02:01:50,910 --> 02:01:52,050
Let's go, Jaya.

2286
02:02:00,140 --> 02:02:02,210
Satya and you were born
in the same hospital.

2287
02:02:03,950 --> 02:02:06,020
Our Satya was born two
hours after your birth.

2288
02:02:06,330 --> 02:02:10,400
I was the first person to pick
and hold you after your birth.

2289
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:20,470
I thought of seeing your father again.

2290
02:02:22,370 --> 02:02:23,910
But I am seeing you, instead.

2291
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:27,840
God bless you.

2292
02:02:47,650 --> 02:02:48,670
How is it?

2293
02:02:49,190 --> 02:02:51,110
-Do you like it?
-Very beautiful!

2294
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:55,080
When you were born, I told your mother
that I wish you were my daughter-in-law.

2295
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:56,310
Thank you for accepting our proposal.

2296
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:59,170
Rakesh likes you so much.

2297
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:01,530
Very nice!

2298
02:03:01,730 --> 02:03:02,990
Excuse me, can you show me more designs?

2299
02:03:03,070 --> 02:03:05,400
-[in unison] Ma'am, we are your fans.
-Oh!

2300
02:03:05,530 --> 02:03:06,560
[in unison] One selfie please.

2301
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:08,690
Keep seeing them, I'll be right back.

2302
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:10,070
Please come.

2303
02:03:10,270 --> 02:03:11,340
Let's go over there.

2304
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,030
Click.

2305
02:03:14,410 --> 02:03:15,330
[camera clicks]

2306
02:03:15,910 --> 02:03:17,830
-Hi Satya.
-Oh, hi!

2307
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:20,170
Hi! What a surprise!

2308
02:03:21,130 --> 02:03:22,400
Wedding shopping?

2309
02:03:22,540 --> 02:03:23,620
Yes.

2310
02:03:23,750 --> 02:03:26,910
I expected you'd soon get married
when you came for my matchmaking.

2311
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:28,880
Why so?

2312
02:03:29,970 --> 02:03:31,170
Where is your Madhav?

2313
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:33,400
Madhav?

2314
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:35,080
That guy, Sunnipenta Madhav.

2315
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:37,070
You brought him to the matchmaking, right?

2316
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:41,840
He came to see me for matchmaking,
but he kept looking only at you.

2317
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:44,830
That's when I thought that
he is in love with you.

2318
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,560
Really, you are made for each other.

2319
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:55,480
"Strangely, they opened their
eyes at the same place as a pair"

2320
02:03:55,630 --> 02:03:59,970
"This journey has started
from the time of their birth"

2321
02:04:01,710 --> 02:04:06,540
"He appeared again like this to melt
away distance of all these years"

2322
02:04:06,830 --> 02:04:11,540
"Fate has split us
apart then and even now"

2323
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:16,440
"We roamed around happily
like a couple, yesterday"

2324
02:04:16,810 --> 02:04:20,770
"And it ended up like this like a dream"

2325
02:04:22,150 --> 02:04:27,000
"This is a strange unexpected story"

2326
02:04:27,310 --> 02:04:31,840
"which began with two of us in it"

2327
02:04:32,020 --> 02:04:36,820
"As our distance has increased"

2328
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:42,000
"will the heart stay still?"

2329
02:04:42,370 --> 02:04:47,160
"Please don't cast me out"

2330
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:51,200
"The path which
my step is showing is you"

2331
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:52,410
[sneezes]

2332
02:04:59,410 --> 02:05:00,440
[sneezes]

2333
02:05:08,270 --> 02:05:09,270
[sneezes]

2334
02:05:24,610 --> 02:05:25,620
[sneezes]

2335
02:05:25,820 --> 02:05:31,250
[wedding percussion]

2336
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:47,620
[tyres screech]

2337
02:05:51,310 --> 02:05:52,480
Satya...

2338
02:05:53,630 --> 02:05:54,680
What's this?

2339
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:56,230
Since you like it...

2340
02:05:56,430 --> 02:05:57,820
So, would you give it as a gift?

2341
02:05:58,530 --> 02:05:59,880
Will you give such a gift to a girl?

2342
02:06:00,150 --> 02:06:01,900
Because you look
beautiful when you sneeze.

2343
02:06:02,190 --> 02:06:03,660
Who are you to tell that?

2344
02:06:03,930 --> 02:06:05,970
What's the work you have come
for and what are you doing?

2345
02:06:06,170 --> 02:06:08,430
You walked in without any hesitation
for three match makings in a single day.

2346
02:06:08,580 --> 02:06:10,120
When you went for the matchmaking,
you have to see the girl.

2347
02:06:10,350 --> 02:06:10,860
Uh-uh!

2348
02:06:11,120 --> 02:06:13,000
But did you find me as pastime?

2349
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:15,130
Hey, why are you saying pastime?

2350
02:06:15,610 --> 02:06:18,610
Oh man! I was all good.

2351
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:21,670
But you started to chatter that I'd be
beautiful when I smile and sneeze,

2352
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:24,410
Instead of seeing the girl you have been
for, you were recording my videos.

2353
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:26,870
What did you tell the
girl who you saw first?

2354
02:06:27,110 --> 02:06:29,890
She was telling me that you
were supposed to be with me

2355
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,410
as you were in love with me.

2356
02:06:31,510 --> 02:06:32,540
What did you tell her?

2357
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:35,750
What did I tell?

2358
02:06:35,950 --> 02:06:37,370
She is a mad girl.

2359
02:06:37,570 --> 02:06:38,650
What does she know about you?

2360
02:06:38,830 --> 02:06:40,940
She doesn't know that you'd change
colours like a chameleon, within an hour.

2361
02:06:41,650 --> 02:06:42,700
Moreover, your ring...

2362
02:06:42,820 --> 02:06:45,930
I don't understand why it got
stuck and why I swallowed it.

2363
02:06:46,230 --> 02:06:47,230
It's all my ill-fate!

2364
02:06:50,410 --> 02:06:52,920
I've been talking here and
you were looking somewhere.

2365
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:54,220
Damn!

2366
02:06:54,420 --> 02:06:55,530
Satya!

2367
02:06:55,850 --> 02:06:57,590
I am a fool!

2368
02:06:58,250 --> 02:07:01,910
As I didn't know about you,
I imagined many sorts of things about you.

2369
02:07:02,010 --> 02:07:04,400
-Satya, listen to me--
-Don't come closer. Stop right there.

2370
02:07:04,780 --> 02:07:08,420
I lived happily for 26 years
without any flashback.

2371
02:07:09,070 --> 02:07:11,570
But you brought a non-existent
disease within a day.

2372
02:07:13,770 --> 02:07:15,790
And finally, you gave me this as well.

2373
02:07:16,350 --> 02:07:18,350
Should I live sneezing forever out
of the pain of not able to forget you?

2374
02:07:21,630 --> 02:07:24,030
It might be easy for you to forget girls.

2375
02:07:24,790 --> 02:07:26,170
But I can't do that.

2376
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:27,860
Easy for me?

2377
02:07:28,620 --> 02:07:29,770
As if you have done less!

2378
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:30,760
What did I do?

2379
02:07:36,020 --> 02:07:36,760
What's this?

2380
02:07:36,850 --> 02:07:38,160
'Sunnipenta Satyabhama'.

2381
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:40,170
You could have written
'Thupakula Satyabhama'.

2382
02:07:40,280 --> 02:07:42,710
'Sunnipenta Satyabhama,' huh!
What does this mean?

2383
02:07:46,170 --> 02:07:48,160
Yes, I wrote that.

2384
02:07:48,910 --> 02:07:51,640
Unaware of your nature,
I wrote that out of my senseless.

2385
02:07:52,190 --> 02:07:53,520
But what did you do?

2386
02:07:56,340 --> 02:07:58,260
I don't have any thought about marriage.

2387
02:07:59,090 --> 02:08:01,860
But I am marrying Rakesh,
out of anger towards you.

2388
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:05,390
I'll anyway forget! As if you are great!

2389
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:07,450
-Hey...
-I'll live more happily than you. Mind it!

2390
02:08:07,650 --> 02:08:09,730
Ow! Satya... I love you, Satya!

2391
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:14,720
I love you. Trust me!

2392
02:08:16,130 --> 02:08:16,760
You idiot!

2393
02:08:18,050 --> 02:08:19,290
Hey... Hey...

2394
02:08:19,390 --> 02:08:20,600
What are you doing with my sword?

2395
02:08:20,630 --> 02:08:21,680
[people panicking]

2396
02:08:21,970 --> 02:08:24,750
Have you proposed me out of
no choice, since she eloped?

2397
02:08:24,990 --> 02:08:26,230
Hey... Hey... Nothing like that.

2398
02:08:26,310 --> 02:08:28,810
Please... Satya, listen to me.

2399
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:30,640
I okayed Bhagyamathi
not because I liked her.

2400
02:08:30,870 --> 02:08:32,720
I okayed her to help her. That's it!

2401
02:08:33,620 --> 02:08:34,620
You are the only girl I liked.

2402
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:36,510
Hey... Hey... Please... Please.

2403
02:08:37,140 --> 02:08:38,620
That's why I didn't look at any
girls in all the match makings.

2404
02:08:38,860 --> 02:08:39,950
All I did was looking at you.

2405
02:08:40,100 --> 02:08:41,700
-Please... Hey... Please.
-Watch out!

2406
02:08:42,430 --> 02:08:43,190
Hey!

2407
02:08:45,830 --> 02:08:48,520
You aren't Sword Satyabhama.
You are Thupakula (Guns) Satyabhama.

2408
02:08:48,990 --> 02:08:50,460
Please trust me.

2409
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:51,440
I love you.

2410
02:08:52,110 --> 02:08:53,800
Now you can become
Sunnipenta Satyabhama, right?

2411
02:08:56,310 --> 02:08:59,290
I'd give company to your daddy in
boozing. I'll make you a mother.

2412
02:08:59,580 --> 02:09:02,170
I'll make you a grandmother
and even a great grandmother.

2413
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:04,500
And I'll make you an
old aged woman as well.

2414
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:06,640
Please...

2415
02:09:07,570 --> 02:09:08,230
I love you.

2416
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:10,230
I can't live without you.

2417
02:09:11,700 --> 02:09:12,390
I love you, Satya.

2418
02:09:13,620 --> 02:09:14,320
Trust me.

2419
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:23,360
[people cheering]

2420
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:27,410
Here, take this.

2421
02:10:11,810 --> 02:10:13,730
[in unison] Shaadi Mubarak
(Congratulations on the marriage)

2422
02:10:39,070 --> 02:10:40,130
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

2423
02:10:45,560 --> 02:10:46,480
Son-in-law...

2424
02:10:47,150 --> 02:10:51,810
You have fulfilled my wish
of boozing with a son-in-law.

2425
02:10:52,300 --> 02:10:54,030
Thank you very much.

2426
02:10:57,090 --> 02:10:58,250
I am also very happy uncle.

2427
02:10:59,810 --> 02:11:01,290
It didn't happen as per the
astrologer's prediction.

2428
02:11:01,570 --> 02:11:03,220
I've married the girl
who is younger than me.

2429
02:11:04,850 --> 02:11:06,700
It did happen as per the
astrologer's prediction.

2430
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:10,830
How's that, uncle?

2431
02:11:11,970 --> 02:11:13,700
Satya and I were born on the same day.

2432
02:11:14,820 --> 02:11:15,320
Right.

2433
02:11:15,410 --> 02:11:17,540
I was born two hours before Satya.

2434
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:20,550
Right.

2435
02:11:20,860 --> 02:11:22,480
That means I am elder than Satya.

2436
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:24,030
Wrong.

2437
02:11:24,850 --> 02:11:26,820
What astrologer predicted was right.

2438
02:11:29,050 --> 02:11:29,630
How is that?

2439
02:11:30,170 --> 02:11:34,060
Since your mother met with an accident,
you were born in the eighth month.

2440
02:11:36,150 --> 02:11:39,850
But Satya was born only after
completion of 9 months.

2441
02:11:41,150 --> 02:11:43,740
That's when both of you
were born on the same day.

2442
02:11:44,390 --> 02:11:49,570
Which means, Satya is
a month elder than you.

2443
02:11:50,470 --> 02:11:51,150
Right?

2444
02:11:52,420 --> 02:11:53,310
[coughs]

2445
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:54,920
Tell me once again, uncle.

2446
02:11:55,750 --> 02:11:56,990
What's there to say?

2447
02:11:57,400 --> 02:11:59,620
Look, the domination has started.

2448
02:12:00,610 --> 02:12:02,060
Enough of boozing. Come inside.

2449
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:03,380
-One minute, Satya.
-[laughing]

2450
02:12:09,470 --> 02:12:13,340
"Come on, Satyabhama"

2451
02:12:14,550 --> 02:12:16,930
"Satyabhama... Satyabhama"

2452
02:12:17,070 --> 02:12:18,810
"You are a moon"

2453
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:23,270
-"I will call your name as my love"
-She is coming. The domination continues.

2454
02:12:24,260 --> 02:12:26,440
"Satyabhama... Satyabhama"

2455
02:12:26,650 --> 02:12:28,710
"Get appealed like
a branch of flowers"

2456
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:33,350
"I will call your love as mine"

2457
02:12:33,890 --> 02:12:38,430
"You have stopped like a rain
drop and turned like a flood"

2458
02:12:38,710 --> 02:12:42,950
"and drowned my heart"

2459
02:12:43,140 --> 02:12:47,490
"Come on, Satyabhama"

2460
02:12:47,690 --> 02:12:52,180
"I won't let go of you"

2461
02:13:12,010 --> 02:13:14,390
"For the eyes that met
for the first time..."

2462
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:16,800
"For the desires of
heart that blossomed..."

2463
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:19,220
"For the lips that is
unaware of the language of love..."

2464
02:13:19,420 --> 02:13:21,420
"You have poured life into them"

2465
02:13:21,630 --> 02:13:23,970
"With your annoying words..."
