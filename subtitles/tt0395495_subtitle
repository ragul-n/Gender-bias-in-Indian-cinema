1
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,951
<i>You want to know</i>
<i>what I keep thinking about?</i>

2
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,888
<i>That argument we had right before you Ieft.</i>

3
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,291
<i>Remember?</i>

4
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,632
<i>There you are, heading off</i>
<i>for your big bacheIor party fishing trip</i>

5
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,934
<i>and I start in on you</i>
<i>Iike some hystericaI fishwife,</i>

6
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,141
<i>insisting that you finish the seating chart</i>
<i>before you go.</i>

7
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,105
<i>What was I thinking?</i>

8
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,943
<i>What I shouId have said</i>
<i>as you were Ieaving is, " I Iove you. "</i>

9
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:54,547
<i>Or, at Ieast... I don't know.</i>
<i>"Have fun. Be nice to the strippers. "</i>

10
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,421
<i>Instead, the Iast words</i>
<i>you heard me say were,</i>

11
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:04,821
<i>"Listen, paI,</i>

12
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,095
<i>"no more nookie untiI you figure out</i>
<i>where to put your mother's bridge cIub. "</i>

13
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,296
Our hearts go out to you.

14
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,831
How you doing, Mrs. D?
You need anything?

15
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:18,529
A Scotch, but thin it out.
Don't let me get all lrish.

16
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:24,699
-You boys were just lovely today.
-Oh, sorry.

17
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:27,808
My God.

18
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,075
He had good friends.

19
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,349
He was a friend of yours?
The guy who died?

20
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,047
Yeah. We grew up together.

21
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,746
So, you live here in Boulder?

22
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,757
No. l moved away after high school.

23
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,792
-Where to?
-Los Angeles.

24
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:47,257
-Oh, yeah? What do you do there?
-l make commercials.

25
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,365
ls that a tattoo?

26
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:51,797
Maybe.

27
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:58,009
<i>How couId you Ieave me aIone</i>
<i>with aII these peopIe?</i>

28
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,072
<i>You know I hate crowds.</i>

29
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,370
<i>And high heeIs.</i>

30
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,309
<i>I'm wearing heeIs.</i>
<i>I don't know what I'm doing.</i>

31
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,682
<i>I wouId if you were here.</i>

32
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:12,620
<i>You'd know how to make aII these peopIe</i>
<i>stop taIking about you in the past tense,</i>

33
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,124
<i>how to get your pervy uncIe off me.</i>

34
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,128
<i>How couId you Ieave me aIone</i>
<i>with your pervy uncIe?</i>

35
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,097
<i>You know I can't handIe him.</i>

36
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,928
<i>I can't handIe anything without you.</i>

37
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,002
She say anything to you
about the honeymoon?

38
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,637
-Like what?
-Like, is she still going to go?

39
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,979
Alone in Kauai?
You think that's what she needs right now.

40
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:16,021
No, dude, not alone.
You know, with a friend.

41
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,824
Because l think it'd be good for her
to get away.

42
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,586
That kind of thing could be really helpful.

43
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:28,824
-Not me, Dennis. A friend. Anybody.
-Yeah. Somebody else.

44
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,405
Damn.

45
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,932
Sock it to me.

46
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,368
Sock it to me. Sock it to me.

47
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,308
Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to me.

48
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,804
Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to me.

49
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,611
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on.

50
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,780
Butt cramp.

51
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:23,947
Okay, go.

52
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,556
Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to me.

53
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,754
Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to me.

54
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,127
Sock it to me!

55
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,523
Yeah! That's good!

56
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,761
That's really good!

57
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,774
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

58
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,840
Employees must wash their hands
before returning to work.

59
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,453
Call me,

60
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,292
Mr. Yummy.

61
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,330
Okay. All right.

62
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,464
Jesus!

63
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,607
Oh, shit.

64
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,303
Gray.

65
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:30,671
<i>You reaIize, since you weren't married,</i>
<i>Mrs. DougIas is the IegaI heir.</i>

66
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,008
We're just putting the estate in order.

67
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:35,780
Yep.

68
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:36,844
Okay.

69
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,153
Now, did you and Mr. Douglas
share title on anything?

70
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,755
-Car, house?
-No, l'm in a rental.

71
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,028
Which l can't afford by myself. Wow.

72
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,630
We just found it. He hadn't even moved in.

73
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,434
Where's the paperwork for this big account?

74
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,307
What big account?

75
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:05,611
There's $48,000 on his tax return.
l'm not seeing any statements for it.

76
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,518
His savings had about that much, right?

77
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,489
No, the $48,000 is interest, Gray.

78
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,554
So, for an account to generate that,
the balance would have to be

79
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,455
roughly a million dollars.

80
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,094
A million dollars?

81
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,434
Yeah, in some big investment account.

82
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,303
l bet you he inherited it
when his old man died.

83
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,471
You don't think it's a little weird
that he didn't tell us that he was rich?

84
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,447
Not really.
l mean, what business is it of ours?

85
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,778
l was his partner.

86
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,115
Point is, Dennis, it wasn't business money.

87
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,950
You know? lt was his money, so...

88
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,645
He should've at least told you.

89
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:49,389
lf it were me, if we were engaged
and l had a million bucks, there's no way...

90
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:53,865
Whoa. First off, this chick is only nice
to you because l'm your friend. Okay?

91
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:58,131
Second off, you don't have two nickels to
rub together, sir. l've seen your ATM card.

92
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,502
-l'm just saying.
-And l'm just saying

93
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:04,100
there are hundreds,
thousands of really good reasons

94
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:08,078
my homeboy wouldn't have wanted to tell
everyone his dad left him a million bucks.

95
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,705
Like what?

96
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:15,048
Well, like, maybe he was afraid that
he'd become some kind of layy dilettante

97
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:19,490
if he had all that money at his access,
so he just put it away, just ignore it.

98
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,993
But, hello! Come on!
Like he wasn't going to tell you?

99
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:26,862
l mean, l bet you he was just waiting to,
like, rock you with a big surprise.

100
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,299
Because that was Grady's style.
He never did something small.

101
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:34,169
lt was just, plow! And, suddenly, he would
want to find a way to just spring it on you.

102
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,571
You know? Like...

103
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,066
On your wedding night.

104
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,503
-You think so?
-Oh, God, yes!

105
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,775
Picture this.

106
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,783
You guys are on the honeymoon. Okay?

107
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,755
You just had hours upon hours of sex,

108
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,518
without me or Dennis in the house
for a change.

109
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:57,289
And you're falling asleep
in one another's arms, coyying up to you.

110
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,464
And he's like, <i>"</i> Um, Geege,

111
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:04,094
<i>"</i>remember the part of the vows
where we said, 'For richer or for poorer'

112
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,565
<i>"</i>We're the former!<i>"</i>

113
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,003
God, he would have loved doing that.

114
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,275
He would have.

115
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:24,645
Whoa. Running low, l see.
Gray, l'm going to take your last beer.

116
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:39,496
<i>"</i>Loss and possession,
death and life are one.

117
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:44,134
<i>"</i>There falls no shadow
where there shines no sun<i>."</i>

118
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:47,940
Hilaire Belloc.

119
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,774
Who's that?

120
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,680
l don't know, but it's an excellent quote
l put on the Red Zinger box.

121
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,580
Thought it was appropriate. Shall we?

122
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,317
Oh, that's it, dude. l am so getting married.

123
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,363
This chick made out
like it was her bar mitzvah.

124
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,831
-Oh, God. Put it back, Sammy.
-Why, dude? She's got, like, six of them.

125
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,461
Yeah. She's got, like, six of them.
Thank you.

126
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,596
Why you got to be like that?
l'm just trying to feather our nest.

127
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,140
You're just trying to feather your stomach.

128
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,608
You know what? That was hateful.
You're such a blatant sizeist sometimes.

129
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,310
The thing's got, like, 82 settings, sir.

130
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,111
You and me could have a total waffle party,
because we...

131
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,854
-What are you doing?
-She'll be more comfortable in bed.

132
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,355
Are you serious?
Did you not see the pills kick in?

133
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,450
The only way she'd be more comfortable
is if you shot her with a tranq gun.

134
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,394
All l know is, she's not going to wake up
in the morning with a neck crick.

135
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,261
What are you talking about, a neck crick?
What are you, an osteopath?

136
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,391
Oh, my God, you're actually picking her up!

137
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,935
Dennis, you're scaring me, man.

138
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,095
-Put the woman down.
-Get out of my way.

139
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:48,572
No. Did it ever occur to you that maybe she
don't want to sleep in there without Grady?

140
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,472
Did it occur to you
that l'm holding her right now?

141
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,841
-Seriously, Sir Galahad, put her back.
-lf you're not going to help...

142
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,880
l'm much stronger than you
and even l don't want to pick her up.

143
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,608
-No, she's heavy.
-Put her on the couch!

144
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,218
She's out.

145
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,791
-This was totally your fault.
-This is not my fault,

146
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,021
-this is your fault.
-Clean this up.

147
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:13,395
You're not... l'm not... Come on.
Come on, dude.

148
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,331
-Want a beer?
-Shut up.

149
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,051
Okay.

150
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:11,578
Hey.

151
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:19,158
This is Grady's room. You have no right...
What are you doing here?

152
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,823
Sleeping.

153
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,364
What time is it?

154
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,730
l didn't feel like going home right away, so...

155
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,276
The guys said it'd be okay
if l crashed here for a while.

156
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,868
Don't touch that. Just don't touch anything.

157
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,846
You think you can handle that, Mr. Yummy?

158
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,682
l didn't know you were there.

159
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,458
Why are you still here?

160
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,722
l thought you were supposed to be
in Los Angeles,

161
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,286
directing a movie or something.

162
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,195
No, that didn't work out.

163
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,700
Which, you know, thank God.

164
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,937
Movies, they're worse than commercials.

165
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:04,800
Just sell, sell, sell.
But let's kid ourselves and call it art.

166
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:10,176
At least in ads it's sell, sell, sell,
but we all know we're going to hell.

167
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,548
So here's a fat ass check
to smooth out the ride.

168
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,889
l never understood
why he was friends with you.

169
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,357
You don't even seem like you miss him.

170
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:55,853
Hi, l'm the administrator of the estate
of a client of yours who passed away.

171
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:00,888
l need copies of his statement accounts
for the last three... Yes, l'll hold.

172
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,801
-Gray. Gray.
-Yeah?

173
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,400
l just wanted to tell you how sorry l am.

174
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,043
Thank you.

175
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,352
You know, a similar thing happened
to a friend of my cousin's .

176
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,212
Young guy, skiing.

177
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:29,049
Some kid on a snowboard comes up,
totally out of control...

178
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,322
Bam.

179
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,921
Snowboard severed his jugular.

180
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,964
Blood all over the slope.

181
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,460
And then, you know, people started
to ski over it, so it spread down the hill.

182
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,003
Anyway.

183
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,851
So, a peace garden for Grady.

184
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:02,750
Yeah, you know. At the fly shop.
ln that space behind the truck?

185
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:08,059
So it's kind of, then, more like
a peace parking spot than anything else.

186
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,464
Shut up, dude.

187
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,561
He'd be all over it.

188
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,300
-l don't think so, cookie.
-Well, l do.

189
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,001
And l knew him better than you did, so...

190
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,844
What?

191
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,939
Are you serious?

192
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,681
Oh, my God, Dennis, like, l may not have
been the dude's business partner, okay,

193
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,981
-but, like, me and Grady were tight, sir.
-Okay, okay.

194
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,145
Very tight.

195
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:34,726
ln fact, l just happen to know he told me
stuff that he would never tell you.

196
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,391
Stuff l bet you never thought
would leave the walls

197
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,727
of your super-secret fly-fishing shop.

198
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,431
Like what?

199
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,500
-What stuff?
-Just stuff stuff, Dennis!

200
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,039
Just work stuff. Stuff about work.

201
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,972
All right. You're drinking too much.
Give me that.

202
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,568
Are you...

203
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,271
That's your big move.

204
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,008
<i>"</i>You're drinking too much.
Going to take your pole<i>."</i>

205
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:01,109
You know what?
l guess the best offense is a good defense.

206
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:05,188
Did you even go into work today, assface,

207
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:08,124
or did you just hang around
and get loaded?

208
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,387
Not that it's any of your business,

209
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,725
but l took a mental health day,
if you must know.

210
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,466
l'm depressed, all right?
My best friend just died.

211
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,866
Oh, l'm sorry, he wasn't my best friend.
He was your best friend.

212
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,509
Hey. Are these things hard to use?

213
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,237
No.

214
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,916
-Jackass!
-Sorry.

215
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,045
l think the hill was a good idea.

216
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,248
l think the hill was an excellent idea.

217
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,932
Come on, Dennis!

218
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:49,993
What?

219
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,004
lf you don't hurry up, l'm going to
burn this stuff on principle alone.

220
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,131
l'm not listening to you
until you're fully dressed.

221
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,471
Gray lady down,
just in time for the barbecue.

222
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,375
You're not going to believe this.

223
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,510
-He transferred $3,000 out.
-Yup.

224
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,277
-Every month?
-Yup.

225
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,508
And you don't know
whose account it went to?

226
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,520
Nope. Do you?

227
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,779
Me? No idea.

228
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,685
-Sammy, do you know?
-First l heard of it.

229
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:03,405
You know, not for nothing,
but we could totally use a blender.

230
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,114
Supper, supper, supper, supper.

231
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,487
Supper, supper, supper, supper.

232
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,156
-Supper, and nothing for Fritzie-time!
-God.

233
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,995
-Check it out.
-Oh, Sammy.

234
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,600
-You didn't need to do this.
-You're right. l didn't , but,

235
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,035
<i>"</i>What comes from the heart
goes to the heart<i>."</i>

236
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,104
Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

237
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,603
Tummy Mint?

238
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,239
No, that would be the Celestial Seasonings'
Echinacea Complete Care.

239
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,744
Excellent guess.

240
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,747
Let me ask you a question. lt ain't going to
freak you out, staying in here?

241
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,048
ln what way?

242
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,982
You know, in the way that he's not...
You know...

243
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,352
l'm pretty clear on that fact, Sam.

244
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,127
Get your feed on.

245
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,489
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

246
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,776
Dennis!

247
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,283
Oh, God.

248
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,740
Either answer it or turn it off.

249
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,344
That's not mine.

250
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,113
Whose is it?

251
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,148
Maybe it is. Let me see.

252
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,325
Ten missed calls.

253
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,420
-l can figure that out.
-Ten's a lot.

254
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,055
Here. Let me...

255
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,498

256
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:23,371
lf you don't know whose it is,
you probably shouldn't listen to those.

257
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,773
l know whose it is.

258
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,474
Okay.

259
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,450
<i>Hey, Grady. It's me.</i>

260
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,794

261

268
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,621
You're funny.

269
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,657
Okay, wait a minute.

270
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,062
l'm going to ask you a question.

271
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,425
What do you

272
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,361
think when you hear someone say,

273
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,699
<i>"</i>Go ahead, give it to me<i>"</i> ?

274
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,708
l've got this.

275
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,511
Hi.

276
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,554
-l'm taking you home.
-No, you're not.

277
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:24,954
l am a grown-ass woman.
l don't need you to Hollywood me home.

278
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,411
What are you doing?

279
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,978
l'm just trying to figure out
what's more tragic,

280
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,748
if this is your laundry or hers.

281
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,642
l had nothing to do with it.

282
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,952
So, what are we painting today?

283
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,855
Where's the 323 area code for?

284
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,398
He's on my bed.

285
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,960
You know her, don't you?
323, that's L.A. You know her.

286
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:15,966
Right?

287
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,072
How long has she been in his life?
Just tell me that.

288
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:23,347
-She's not.
-Forget it. You suck.

289
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,975
She's not in his life. She's just...

290
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,787
The mother of his kid.

291
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:41,729
Do you need anything?

292
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,163
What l need is a little more information

293
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,538
about how my fiancé

294
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,870
could have a child
that l know nothing about.

295
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,371
Okay. lt was...

296
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,310
lt was a one-time thing.

297
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,414
He was in town.

298
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,855
We went to a Halloween party.
He hooked up with this woman.

299
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,587
When? How long ago?

300
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,494
Before you.

301
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:14,361
-How old is the kid?
-l don't know. Seven? Eight?

302
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,863
-ls it a boy or a girl?
-Boy.

303
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,729
God!

304
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,973
-Want to sit down?
-No.

305
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:31,746
What is she like?

306
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,146
l don't know.

307
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,210
-ls she pretty?
-l don't know.

308
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,620
-Answer me.
-She's attractive,

309
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,193
in a messed-up, makeup-y kind of way.

310
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,762
She doesn't swear. What is that?

311
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,460
What kind of...

312
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:51,798
What kind of grown woman
goes around saying <i>"</i> F you<i>"</i> ?

313
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,703
The kind with a kid.

314
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,243
Great.

315
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:12,082
This is why you're still here, isn't it?

316
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,386
To clean up after him.

317
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:21,655
You have blue paint in your hair.

318
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,030
lt's not blue. lt's Marrakech Mystery.

319
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:33,108
-Why is she calling?
-She wants her money.

320
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,410
What do you mean?

321
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,011
He sent her money.

322
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,317
She hasn't gotten any lately,
what with him being dead and all.

323
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,784
She's effing p.o.'ed.

324
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:52,985
l'll take care of it.
l'll send her some money myself.

325
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:55,696
l think she counts on it.

326
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:57,700
For rent and stuff.

327
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:04,035
l counted on him, too. Look where it got me.

328
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,848
lncidentally, l do.

329
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,187
Miss him.

330
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,592
Yeah. Los Angeles?

331
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:36,600
Okay, l need the number
and the street address

332
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,738
for Maureen Monette.

333
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,910
Thank you.

334
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,450
Hey. You probably don't remember me.
My name's Fritz.

335
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,988
l'm a friend of Grady Douglas'

336
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,919
l have some news.

337
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,089
Paul Hexter, please. Fritz Messing calling.

338
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,124
Thank you.

339
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,926
-Excuse me.
-Hey! Yeah, sorry l didn't call you back.

340
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:09,770
l need you to send $20,000
to a massage therapist in Encino.

341
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,275
Hello.

342
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,906
Hi.

343
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,243
lt's so good to see you.

344
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,545
Nice to see you, too.

345
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,681
Thanks for calling.

346
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,950
Before we eat,
l brought you a little something.

347
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,058
Go on, open it.

348
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,328
Gosh, Ellen.

349
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,096
lt was my great aunt's

350
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,399
and the setting is very rare.

351
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:44,364
And l want you to have it.

352
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,539
lt's so special. lt's so beautiful.

353
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:54,879
l just wanted you to have something
to remember us by.

354
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,711
And that ring, well...

355
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,515
The stone has been in our family
for six generations.

356
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:06,895
And l know, now that you won't be

357
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:08,932
in the family...

358
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,661
l know
you wouldn't be comfortable keeping it.

359
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,845
Are you asking
for my engagement ring back?

360
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,512
Grady gave me this ring.

361
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:40,225
lt was a symbol of our decision
to spend the rest of our lives together.

362
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,894
Yes, but you didn't spend
the rest of your life with him.

363
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:48,931
He spent the rest of his with me.

364
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,478
l don't know what to say.

365
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,712
l'm going to go.

366
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,559
What is it with this town?

367
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,600
Everyone's so happy all the time.

368
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,427
And people aren't happy in Los Angeles?

369
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:58,464
Not like this.
This is like a Patagonia Disneyland.

370
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,237
Maybe they're all medicated.

371
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,803
You hear about that, you know,
towns where everybody's on Prozac?

372
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,974
Sounds pretty good. When can l move?

373
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,278
Bad day?

374
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,179
-Not great.
-What happened?

375
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,484
l was attacked by a mountain lion.

376
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,920
-Seriously?
-Oh, sort of. Kind of.

377
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:19,723
Hey, l...

378
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,660
l have something for you.

379
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,136
lt was Grady's .

380
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,069
l thought you might want it.

381
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,144
-lf you don't , you don't have to...
-No. No. Thank you.

382
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,189
Sporty.

383
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:57,090
l have to get back to work.

384
00:33:57,168 --> 00:34:00,001
Tragic widow. Right?

385
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,440
lf you can't blow off work now,
when can you?

386
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,744
l used to take pictures all the time.

387
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,684
Why'd you stop?

388
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:18,386
l started getting paid for it.
Took all the fun out.

389
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,722
l owe you an apology.

390
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,657
Just one?

391
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,597
l mean the funeral. Sorry l ruined it for you.

392
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:41,743
Yeah, if it hadn't been for you,
that would've been one great day.

393
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,245
l just...

394
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:51,651
Didn't want to be there, you know?
l wanted to be anywhere but there.

395
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:54,213
-You know?
-l know.

396
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,389
l mean, hey, if the other caterer
hadn't been gay, who knows?

397
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,795
l might've been doing
the same thing myself.

398
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:07,001
-Probably not.
-Yeah, probably not.

399
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,887
So, what are we doing tomorrow?
A little hiking? Mountain biking?

400
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,026
l can't skip work two days in a row.

401
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,119
Of course you can.
You can do whatever you want.

402
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,721
l don't know.

403
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,996
l do. Trust me. Hooky looks good on you.

404
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,601
Hey, check it out!
Grady just won $10 million.

405
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,299
That worked out well.

406
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,270
What the hell are you doing?

407
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:52,275
Little party, sir.

408
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,544
Jesus.

409
00:35:56,587 --> 00:36:00,614
Sammy, did you take some of these?
How many of these did you take?

410
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,121
Hey. You dumbass. All right.

411
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:07,392
Come on, Sammy, get up. Come on.
We're getting up and we're walking.

412
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,956
-Come on, buddy. Get up. Get up.
-All right, all right.

413
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,065
Sammy?

414
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,419
Those were my pills, Sam.

415
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:34,885
lf anyone's going to use them to check out,
it's going to be me.

416
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:38,455
Sorry.

417
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,759
l knew it was a bad idea.

418
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,633
Which? l mean, the vodka, the pills
or the combo?

419
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,304
The trip.

420
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,707
And l almost told him.

421
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:58,615
You know, like, so many times,
l was this close to saying,

422
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:03,643
<i>"</i>Come on, dude.
That pass, like, in a flat-bottom boat?

423
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,824
<i>"</i>Not even you, you know?
That's just crazy dangerous.

424
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,122
<i>"</i>Don't do it, sir<i>."</i>

425
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,792
And who knows, you know?

426
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:18,058
Maybe just this one time he might be, like...

427
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:21,805
<i>"</i>You're right, Sambo.

428
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:26,040
<i>"</i>Let's just shitcan
the great outdoors this weekend,

429
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,874
<i>"</i>stay home, rock some PlayStation instead<i>."</i>

430
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,822
lt's not your fault.

431
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,448
l just miss him so much.

432
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:48,262
He was just the man, you know?

433
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,461
Move.

434
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,073
Scoot over.

435
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:07,679
Oh, man, l don't want to alarm you,
but you just totally pulled my l.V. out.

436
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:28,066
Oh, my God, you painted!

437
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,437
The walls were disgusting.

438
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,633
lt doesn't even really look like
his room anymore.

439
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,705
lt looks like a Tampax box!

440
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,780
The doctor said he'd be sluggish.

441
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:45,747
Yeah, how about selfish?
Did the doctor say he'd be selfish?

442
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,552
Let's take it a little easy on the guy,

443
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,821
what with him trying to kill himself
and everything.

444
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,090
A few sleeping pills is not a suicide attempt.

445
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:55,392
lt's just his way to get out of
helping with the peace garden.

446
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,433
lf he'd really wanted to end it all, he'd have
gone out and gotten himself a gun.

447
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,562
They're not hard to come by.
This is America.

448
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,870
You guys go on ahead and get started
and l'll bring Sam in a few.

449
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,739
No, you have to be there.
They're expecting you.

450
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,039
l said l'll come.

451
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,223
So, this peace garden,

452
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,286
bringing a lot of peace into your life so far?

453
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,360
That's good. That's funny.

454
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,994
Sam, you almost ready?

455
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,382
Oh, excuse me.

456
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,455
Hi. Can you tell me...

457
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:58,086
l'm looking for someone who knows
something about Grady Douglas.

458
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,004
They're not here.

459
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,438
What?

460
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:16,877
Well, who are you?

461
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,149
l'm the cleaning woman.

462
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,210
Okay, well, can you tell
whoever's dealing with things

463
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,086
that l really need to talk to them?

464
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,856
Here, let me give you my card.

465
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:39,868
Does that game just end
or is it just going on forever?

466
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:44,135
You know when you just put everything in
the thing and you just can't find the one...

467
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,071
Here's me. l'm Maureen.

468
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:51,674
Yeah.

469
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:57,018
And we're staying
at the Silver Saddle Motel, okay?

470
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,416
Thanks.

471
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,722
Come on, honey!

472
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,597
He's not eight, is he?

473
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,032
-What?
-Your son.

474
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:15,602
He's not a very small eight-year-old, is he?

475
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:19,270
No. He'll be four in October. Why?

476
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,250
Eight?

477
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,349
God, the kid's practically in diapers!

478
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,225
Come here.

479
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:36,410
Yes, party people,
let's get this bitch in the ground!

480
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,005
Right? To the roots! Let's plant a tree, man.

481
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:41,947
With the D-Man, where you going?
Where you going, Dennis?

482
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,422
Wait...

483
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,052
Oh, my God, how'd it get to be night out?

484
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:54,028
Oh, Lord. l missed it, didn't l?

485
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,600
Well, that's unfortunate.

486
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,368
Yo.

487
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,339
l think he blew off, hon.
He's on that biking trip again.

488
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,174
Let me get a message from you.

489
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,719
Persephone.

490
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,382
Okay.

491
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:24,256
Hey, man, how's it going down there?
ls it hot?

492
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:26,995
Persephone.

493
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:31,034
She's a Greek deity.
She's the goddess of the underworld?

494
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:33,035
You know what? Forget it. Too complicated.

495
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,765
l'm just going to tell him that you called.

496
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,201
And he will be so pleased.

497
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,939
All right. Bye-bye.

498
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:46,176
l mean,

499
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:50,276
it's not like l called her Antigone
or something. Jesus.

500
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:53,147
Oh, yes!

501
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:57,153
The glorious morning in the corn!

502
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:27,422
So, yeah, it wasn't before you,

503
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:30,483
it was more during you.

504
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:33,663
But it was only just that once, right?

505
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,062
Say <i>"</i> yes,<i>"</i> please.

506
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,194
Hey, l could.

507
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:45,203
Believe me, l can bullshit
until the cows come home, but...

508
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:50,778
How many times?

509
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,442
l wasn't really keeping count.

510
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:59,446
When did it start?

511
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,793
When he started coming out to L.A.
for work.

512
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:07,195
He wouldn't see her
every time he went out there, though...

513
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,561
Would he?

514
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,632
Wow, wow.

515
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:19,034
Oh, this is bad. This is...

516
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,502
lt's really bad.

517
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,609
Was it still going on?

518
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,175
No.

519
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,112
Not as far as l know, anyway.

520
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:41,387
She's really sexy, isn't she?

521
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,826
Naw.

522
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:46,999
No, she is.

523
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:51,366
No.

524
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:06,419
About that

525
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,523
other thing.

526
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,530
That's impossible.

527
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,836
The mother is a massage therapist
in Los Angeles.

528
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:01,209
Well, she's lying. Grady wasn't that stupid.

529
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,140
Well, he was sending her money.

530
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:08,051
He probably felt sorry for her.
He was very generous.

531
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:10,279
l saw the kid. He looks just like him.

532
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:16,091
You could show me 10 toddlers
and l would find

533
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:19,184
similarities between each of them
and Grady.

534
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,530
l'm sure l could.

535
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,363
l talked to Eve.

536
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:32,004
ln Colorado, in the absence of a will,
a child is the sole heir.

537
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,335
Therefore, this boy will get everything.

538
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:42,051
How the hell did you let this happen?

539
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:43,646
Me?

540
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,612
Wait, how am l at fault here?

541
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:48,885
No satisfied man

542
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,885
goes screwing cocktail waitresses.

543
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:54,663
l'm calling Eve.

544
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,034
That kid isn't getting one cent
of my son's money

545
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,332
without coughing up some damn good DNA.

546
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:08,009
Okay, all right. Come on, man!
That's not yours.

547
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:11,479
This ain't funny anymore, kid!
$500 piece of equipment!

548
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,516
All right, put the... Kid, look at me.

549
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,381
l am not in shape enough
to chase you around this house.

550
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,684
-Hey, kid, this is not your shit, man!
-What is the problem?

551
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:22,190
The problem is your kid is like
an earthquake in short pants.

552
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:23,624
-He's all over the joint.
-That's his playfulness.

553
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:27,494
You have to be at ease. lf you're at ease,
then he'll be at ease.

554
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,464
-What?
-Hi.

555
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,161
You didn't give anybody my message.

556
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,860
What is she doing here?

557
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,061
Hey, Gray. This is...

558
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:39,768
l know who she is. l didn't ask who she is.
l asked what she's doing here.

559
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,143
-Boiling water.
-Wait, you know who this is?

560
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:45,181
There's no hot water at the Silver Saddle?

561
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:48,809
Not boiling, and l need boiling water
for my herbal tea.

562
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,577
Because l have to realign my chi.

563
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,316
Stop it! Stop it!

564
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,386
The water's ready.

565
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,236
What are you looking at? We're just talking.

566
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:10,497
What's going on here?

567
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:12,708
Am l missing something?

568
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:28,152
-You're not the cleaning lady?
-Cleaning lady?

569
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:33,028
What'd you come for?

570
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,394
l just told you, l'm

571
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,031
making tea.

572
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:39,693
Because the money's his.

573
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,104
One quick DNA swab and he gets it all.

574
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,767
What are you talking about? What money?

575
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:51,671
What the H-E-double L is she talking about?

576
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:57,685
l'm going out. When l come back,
it would be great if she weren't here.

577
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:06,158
That was awkward.

578
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,600
Here, take this.

579
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,192
l'm not a charity case.

580
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,702
No, keep it. Call it a loan.
l know you're good for it.

581
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:24,939
l didn't even know he was rich, okay?

582
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:28,473
All l knew is that he wanted to
support his kid and that's why l came.

583
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:30,543
To just make sure that
that was going to happen,

584
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,851
not to, you know,
run off with all his money or

585
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:36,883
upset his girlfriend.

586
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,750
lt's <i>"</i> fiancée<i>."</i>

587
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,926
l didn't even know about her.

588
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:47,695
l mean, l figured, you know,
that there was someone.

589
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,965
But he never said he was engaged.

590
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:11,249
You know, it makes sense, though,
her being like that.

591
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:13,719
Like what?

592
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:16,059
Kind of perfect.

593
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:21,936
Because when l saw him, he was always
like this kid on vacation, you know.

594
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:26,999
Kind of goofy, like he was just excited
not to have to be on his best behavior.

595
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:31,941
l got it.

596
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,109
-Thank you.
-Okay.

597
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:37,353
l'll talk to you.

598
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,580
Okay.

599
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,825
l just want you to know, l am back.
Like, in a big way.

600
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:53,734
Just 100% committed.
200% , really, committed

601
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:58,438
to this company and from now on,
every second of every day

602
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,476
l'm just going to be thinking

603
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:04,844
and just dreaming and just flat-out being

604
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,314
herbal tea.

605
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:17,157
Oh, 100% , 200% ...

606
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:20,754
ln Boulder. Number of a Silver Saddle Motel.

607
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:28,935
Oh, my God, this is my favorite.
<i>"</i>Be bold, be bold, everywhere be bold<i>."</i>

608
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,439
Oh, my God, are you kidding me?
l wrote that, man!

609
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:33,703
-What's mung beans?
-Well, you know, l didn't really write it.

610
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:37,645
Spenser wrote it. But l filled out
the paperwork that put it on the box.

611
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,727
Hi.

612
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:54,696
Gray, what are... You're home early.

613
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,926
Yeah, okay, well...

614
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,403
So, you know the other night?
l noticed that this refrigerator...

615
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,804
Do you know everything in here
is a chi blocker?

616
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:08,110
And that's exactly what l'm studying
is Chinese medicine.

617
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:10,578
And, you know,
the first thing we're learning is that

618
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:14,048
you can't , like, emotionally process things

619
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:16,677
if your chi is congested.

620
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:20,849
lt's like a kind of cerebral constipation.

621
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,414
Sorry.

622
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:24,960
Anyway, l just... So...

623
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:27,088
Here!

624
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:43,574
You see?

625
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,537
lt's working!

626
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:49,183
Your color is, like,
coming back in your cheeks and...

627
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:52,847
Do you see, like, the aura?
lt was, like, a dusty... Now it's ...

628
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,755
So, tonight, l'm going to make
the most cleansing dinner

629
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:58,293
and l would love if you would join us.

630
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,856
l wouldn't miss it for the world.

631
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:22,678
Why, thank you, sir.

632
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,713
-Go ahead, Mattie.
-Dinner is served!

633
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:30,257
Oh, right on, man! Fancy shmancy!

634
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,296
lt's beautiful out here.
lt's like a little fairy paradise.

635
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:35,490
-Did you make this in there?
-Yes.

636
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,263
All right!

637
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,727
-She's feeding us lawn.
-Dude, shut up.

638
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:43,329
-Look at this.
-Little pitchers have big ears.

639
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:48,843
You know, radishes are a blood detoxifier.

640
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,575
l got your Happy Meal.

641
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:56,714
The loaf is made
with tempeh and bean paste.

642
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:57,878
Okay.

643
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:00,855
Oh, and l added cheese curds.
That wasn't in the recipe.

644
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:05,361
You are going to be so regular tomorrow,
you're not going to believe it.

645
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:15,871
<i>Namaste.</i>

646
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:17,500
<i>Namaste.</i>

647
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:18,734
<i>Namaste.</i>

648
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:20,802
<i>Namaste.</i>

649
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,105
No.

650
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:33,516
l steal library books.

651
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:37,091
On purpose.

652
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:40,490
l have them from every town
l've ever lived in. l can't control it.

653
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:42,992
Grady never knew that about me.

654
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,236
-Maureen?
-That has wheatgrass in it.

655
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,870
Also, l can put my whole fist in my mouth.

656
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,967
You don't want to see it,
it's a little Traci Lords,

657
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,638
but l never told him that, either,

658
00:56:58,114 --> 00:56:59,581
in six years.

659
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:02,678
Also,

660
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:07,645
l love natural disasters!
l want people to die in them.

661
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:10,625
l'm genuinely disappointed
when the death toll is low.

662
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:13,863
And also, l made it with a girl once.

663
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,863
And do you know what else?
You know what Grady never knew about me

664
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:25,271
is that l think catch and release fishermen
are heartless weenies.

665
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:28,208
l think putting a fish through agony

666
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,471
for nothing more than
your own entertainment is just plain cruel.

667
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:34,676
l think if you're going to torture
a living thing...

668
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:38,312
lf you're going to make it
look into the eyes of its maker,

669
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:41,288
face its own puny little place
in the universe,

670
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:44,451
then, for God's sake,
have the decency to eat it!

671
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,804
This is excellent, Maureen.
l mean, l feel better.

672
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,468
Thanks.

673
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:00,770
Good.

674
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,144
So,

675
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:06,808
were you, like, the bitch

676
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,117
or the butch?

677
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:23,291
You know what? Give me that.
Give me it, you little sniper.

678
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:26,802
This is not a toy. Okay? This is a weapon.

679
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,360
Weapons are toys.

680
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,928
Weapons are...

681
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:33,165
You need a hobby, kid.
ln a big, bad way, and l mean now.

682
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,609
You need like a bike or some comic books,

683
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,442
maybe a fishing rod. Definitely a fishing rod.

684
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:40,682
Your dad was an awesome fisherman.

685
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:43,045
My dad was a superhero.

686
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:50,992
He also fished.

687
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:36,153
That's a lot of dust.

688
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:38,589
Wait, not too far!

689
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,094
But, Maureen, look!

690
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:51,232
Oh, this is beautiful!

691
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:21,697
Smile.

692
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:41,254
Now, if you give a man a fish,

693
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,585
he will have a single meal,

694
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:46,150
but if you teach a man to fish,

695
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:48,987
he will eat his whole life.

696
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:51,530
You know what that is?

697
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:56,562
Kuan Tzu l just rocked you with.
Ancient Chinese philosopher.

698
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:02,234
Quote from the Lemon Zinger
Green Tea box, you might remember.

699
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:05,809
l can tell by your face, no.

700
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:07,349
You know what? Doesn't matter.

701
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:09,746
Fly-fishing.

702
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,584
A lot of people seem to feel that

703
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:18,220
the key piece of equipment is the rod,
but l disagree, sir.

704
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:20,059
l've always felt

705
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,960
all the magic is in the hat.

706
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:28,164
And this hat is yours.

707
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:36,109
lt belonged to your dad.

708
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,715
Very cool.

709
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:19,277
...which is ironic
because that chick had a pretty big-ass...

710
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:24,451
Whoa, hold on. l think we might...
Maybe we're on a log.

711
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:28,420
We're not! We're not on a log, kid.
There's something alive here!

712
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,993
Oh, my God, we got a fish! We're getting a...

713
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,002
Dennis! We're getting a...

714
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:37,267
Look, l'm going to level with you, kid.
l've never caught anything in my life.

715
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,865
l've been faking it. One time l lied
and l bought a fish at a store

716
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:41,910
but this is the first time
l have ever caught a fish

717
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:43,343
and you're going to help me reel it in!

718
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:45,607
Grab the rod.
Come on, we're going to bring him in!

719
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:48,741
Oh, my. This is what God feels like
when he catches a fish!

720
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:51,013
Come on! Come on, you son of a...

721
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:52,816
Bring him in! Reel him in. Pull!

722
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,083
Pull!

723
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:57,717
Dig it! Dig it! Now bring him in!
Bring him in! Yes!

724
01:04:57,827 --> 01:04:59,419
Yes! Yes!

725
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:02,120
Man versus fish. What...

726
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,606
That's kind of... You know what?
He's a little sleepy. Come on, Mattie.

727
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,136
Let's head over this way.

728
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:24,583
Look out, it's a heartless fisherman.

729
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:26,779
Someone call PETA.

730
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:33,355
You know,
fish have brains the size of pebbles.

731
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,992
They don't even remember pain.

732
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:37,623
You keep telling yourself that.

733
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:39,429
lt's the truth.

734
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:44,496
Okay, fine. Just don't lead with it
on a date. lt makes you sound cold.

735
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,210
Hey, who are you dating these days?

736
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:52,739
Nobody.

737
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:56,774
What about that girl from that place
who liked you? You know, with the hair.

738
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,443
-Persephone?
-Yeah.

739
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:01,853
-You should ask her out.
-Yeah, l don't know.

740
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:05,252
l guess l'm not exactly available.

741
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:07,262
What do you mean?
You just said you're not dating.

742
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:12,330
-Oh, you're dating someone secret.
-No.

743
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:14,062
Are you having an affair
with a married woman?

744
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:15,626
No! God!

745
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:18,265
-Dennis, fess up. Do l know her?
-No.

746
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:21,003
-l'm the last one to know everything.
-No! Good God, no.

747
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:24,774
l'm not having an affair
with a married woman. That's ridiculous.

748
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:27,713
l don't know. What else could it be?

749
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:30,183
-You really want to know?
-Badly.

750
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:33,920
All right.

751
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:36,288
l'll tell you.

752
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:42,122
For the past six years,

753
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:44,924
l've been telling myself the same thing.

754
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:50,329
<i>"</i>lt's okay. He's a better man<i>."</i>

755
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:53,436
And it turns out

756
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:56,010
that's just bullshit.

757
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:59,377
Look at what he did to you, Gray.

758
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:07,221
He had, hands-down,
the best girl in the world, and he goes...

759
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,023
lf l had you,

760
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,720
if you were mine, there is no way...

761
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,161
There is no way.

762
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,212
Scratch that.

763
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:36,149
l'm having an affair with a married woman.

764
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:38,780
l do love you, Dennis.

765
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:41,821
That's great.

766
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:27,766
Hey, Mattie.

767
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:32,874
-Hey.
-What?

768
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:40,577
Mattie.

769
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:42,742
Put your foot up. There you go.

770
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:48,220
There we go.

771
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:50,889
We'll get you all fixed up.

772
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:21,122
And today's Little Mary Sunshine Award
goes to...

773
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:57,656
l'm starving.

774
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:06,226
You get extremely cool stuff
when you get married.

775
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:07,735
No wonder people do it.

776
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,003
Were you ever close?

777
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:11,770
To getting married?

778
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:13,597
No.

779
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:16,169
Why not, do you think?

780
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:23,044
l don't know. l guess it just
always made more sense to walk away.

781
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:27,821
Aren't you lonely?

782
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,926
Right now, no.

783
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:36,025
No, just...

784
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:38,427
ln general.

785
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:40,934
Who do you tell your stories to?

786
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,201
l guess l keep them to myself.

787
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:47,306
That's a tragedy.

788
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:51,305
Yeah.

789
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:56,677
You want to hear a story?

790
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,083
l got a good one.

791
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:02,350
Guy goes to a funeral...

792
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:10,558
Sorry.

793
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:20,803
Look at you, rocking the Foreman
at 3:00 in the morning. Right on, sir.

794
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:26,344
You going to eat both of those, or...

795
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:28,976
No.

796
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:32,679
-Dig in.
-Thanks, man.

797
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:40,357
They say you're not supposed to eat
after 7:00, but,

798
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:42,363
what, am l trying to win a beauty contest?

799
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:45,530
Thanks, Fritz!

800
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:48,968
You bet, buddy.

801
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:01,416
They have to take the DNA sample
at the hospital.

802
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:05,180
The only way l could get him to go
was by promising you'd come.

803
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:07,085
Well, l'm glad l could...

804
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,420
Hospitals scare the you-know-what
out of him.

805
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:12,824
He was a preemie. He was, like,
three and a half weeks early,

806
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:16,058
and he wasn't ready
to leave my womb at that point.

807
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:19,965
So l think, like, on some deep psychic level,

808
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:24,970
he must associate hospitals with fear
and separation.

809
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:29,568
Like, <i>"</i> Oh, my God! l'm leaving my mother!

810
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:32,079
<i>"</i>What if l never see her again?

811
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:34,980
<i>"</i>Am l all alone in this world?<i>"</i>

812
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,813
That's a heavy load.

813
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:43,889
You ever hear the expression
<i>"</i>The power of suggestion,<i>"</i> Maureen?

814
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:44,948
'Cause...

815
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:48,458
No, is that, like, a workshop?

816
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,132
Oh, yeah.

817
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,772
So it's a little filthy.

818
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:04,779
-l'm sorry.
-No, that's all right.

819
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:07,975
Can l get you something to drink?
We got beer,

820
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,644
we got some tap water.

821
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,187
-Do you have wine?
-Yes, we have wine.

822
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:18,316
Glasses are over there. Let me see
if we can find something at least drinkable.

823
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:24,059
All right.

824
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:25,826
Here we go.

825
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:31,062
l have no idea if this is any good.
lt was given to me by a client

826
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,165
l took up to Snake River.

827
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:35,772
What is it?

828
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,179
Persephone.

829
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:15,580
Sam, l don't know how to thank you.
l really don't .

830
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:18,218
You know what? lt's totally cool.

831
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:22,381
No, it really could've been a nightmare
with that giant Q-Tip thing.

832
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:24,151
Here, honey.

833
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:26,057
You know what?
This kid did not need my help.

834
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,790
The Force is strong with this one.
l was just there.

835
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:32,800
You know, normally l would offer
to make you something to eat, but...

836
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:34,768
l mean, l have trail mix.

837
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:37,635
l've already had dinner with you once
and, no offense,

838
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:40,641
but l've reached my annual quota of turf.

839
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:42,700
Oh, hey, l know!

840
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:45,008
How about a massage?

841
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:51,344
Did you take a course?

842
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,150
Yeah, this is, like, a percussion-based.

843
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:57,420
All you got to do is watch
the drummers on the beach, really.

844
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:00,894
Any lower and you might hit a gas pocket.

845
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:04,126
Little guy doesn't want to give it up.

846
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:06,064
Maybe he should stay.

847
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:08,932
-Sam, you're not breathing.
-Oh, l'm sorry. l forgot.

848
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:14,201
-Your calves are extraordinary.
-Well, you... Thanks.

849
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:15,800
Did you play football?

850
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:18,676
l watched a lot of football.

851
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,679
Right on.

852
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:28,753
Do you feel that chakra energy?

853
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:31,949
ls that what it is? Yes.

854
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:35,022
lt's very

855
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:36,787
chakr-y.

856
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:39,259
Okay.

857
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:41,234
Well, l can't thank you enough. That was...

858
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:43,271
-Sam, we're not done.
-No?

859
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:45,169
-Turn over.
-What?

860
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:48,799
Oh, no.

861
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:13,854
ls there a name for this method?

862
01:17:13,929 --> 01:17:15,453
Just be open.

863
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:23,629
You can really start to feel the aura change.

864
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:26,706
l feel a light magenta.

865
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:46,553
Oh, my God.

866
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:49,193
Oh, God.

867
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,329
What am l thinking?

868
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:58,272
-lt's totally okay, you know?
-No, it's not.

869
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:02,567
You're being too hard on yourself, man.
lt's not a thing. Don't worry about it.

870
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:06,109
l'm a terrible mother.

871
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:10,209
Oh, come on, that's just crap.
You're an excellent mother.

872
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:13,049
That kid, l've seen you with him.
He loves you, you know?

873
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:14,110
Sam,

874
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,818
l can't do this.

875
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:20,885
lt's too hard.

876
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:23,128
Yes, you can.

877
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:27,765
You can do it.

878
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:33,938
You're a gem.

879
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,173
Come here. Come here.

880
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:55,786
What?

881
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:03,096
My girlfriends and l used to
have this rule with each other.

882
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:08,067
<i>"</i>No sleeping with a guy
until you knew his mother's maiden name<i>."</i>

883
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:10,604
What?

884
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:14,546
We figured it would keep us out of beds of

885
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:17,112
men we barely knew.

886
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:21,149
Gideon.

887
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:22,549
Gideon.

888
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:24,849
Anything else you want to know?

889
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,327
What's your favorite color?

890
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:31,591
Gray.

891
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:37,396
You are not who l thought you were.

892
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,507
Yeah, well,

893
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:43,976
neither are you.

894
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:33,318
Mattie, stop it!

895
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:37,827
Mattie, help me pick these up!

896
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:43,331
Thanks.

897
01:20:43,705 --> 01:20:44,933
Come on!

898
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:49,436
Just leave those.
Do you have to touch every single thing?

899
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:55,481
Hello. Do you like mangoes?

900
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,645
This is a papaya.

901
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,645
Actually, it's a mango.

902
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:04,217
lt's a papaya! Maureen!

903
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:08,393
All right, baby, it's a papaya
if you want it to be a papaya.

904
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:14,834
He has some separation issues
because he has an absent father.

905
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:17,798
Do you have kids?

906
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,100
A son.

907
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,185
Morning, Dennis.

908
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:37,785
What...

909
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,358
What you doing there, sir?

910
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:46,889
All right, seriously, handyman,
whatever this is,

911
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:49,566
just not good for you,

912
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:52,629
really not good for our front door.

913
01:21:57,712 --> 01:21:59,805
Give me the planer, Dennis.

914
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:06,512
Give me the planer, Dennis.

915
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:10,657
Give me the planer, Dennis.

916
01:22:10,725 --> 01:22:13,057
Give me the planer, Dennis!

917
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:14,857
-Give me it.
-Get off me.

918
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,397
Let it go!

919
01:23:10,418 --> 01:23:11,578
Yeah.

920
01:23:39,948 --> 01:23:41,415
Wow! What is this?

921
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:44,449
l need to find a picture
for the garden dedication.

922
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:47,716
l can't find one
where you can really see his face.

923
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:55,288
l'm a big boy, you know?

924
01:23:56,498 --> 01:23:58,523
You could've just told me.

925
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,190
Told you what?

926
01:24:00,268 --> 01:24:03,135
That you were in love with someone else.

927
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:07,302
l'm not.

928
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:10,234
l saw you guys coming in last night.

929
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:15,682
Dennis. God.

930
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:17,783
That's nothing.

931
01:24:17,852 --> 01:24:21,253
lt's less than nothing.

932
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:25,651
Okay.

933
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:29,995
l have stuff in storage. l'll find you a picture.

934
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:32,388
Yeah.

935
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:11,196
Nice dress.

936
01:26:16,237 --> 01:26:18,228
Oh, this is embarrassing.

937
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:22,707
l never got a chance to wear it.

938
01:26:24,112 --> 01:26:25,773
lt's a girl thing.

939
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:33,386
-What are you doing?
-Heading out.

940
01:26:33,454 --> 01:26:36,048
Just wanted to check in, say goodbye.

941
01:26:38,459 --> 01:26:39,983
You're leaving?

942
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:42,823
-Why? What happened?
-Nothing.

943
01:26:44,799 --> 01:26:46,562
Less than nothing,

944
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:48,462
right?

945
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:55,374
Yeah, that's the thing with small houses,
everybody hears everything.

946
01:26:57,478 --> 01:27:00,914
You got to get yourself a big one, like mine.

947
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:04,950
On the beach, in Malibu, waves crashing.

948
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:07,922
Nobody can hear a thing.

949
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:10,183
l didn't mean it.

950
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:13,125
That's okay.

951
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:17,924
Really. l got to get home anyway.

952
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:20,859
Back to reality.

953
01:27:22,637 --> 01:27:23,729
So...

954
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:29,243
-l'll see you.
-Fritz, wait.

955
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:36,511
-l only said that because...
-Because you were embarrassed.

956
01:27:37,385 --> 01:27:38,784
That's okay.

957
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:41,482
Me and you doesn't look good.

958
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:44,948
Not your style, right?

959
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:50,690
l'll see you.

960
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,357
-Wait.
-For what?

961
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:57,427
You going to get out of that wedding dress?
That's gonna take a while.

962
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:04,843
l got to go.

963
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:26,998
Kind of quiet in here, isn't it?

964
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:30,993
<i>"</i>Yeah, it's real quiet, Sam.
Good talking to you, dude<i>."</i>

965
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:20,215
Ladies,

966
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:22,287
not his kid.

967
01:29:23,925 --> 01:29:25,017
What?

968
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:28,526
There's absolutely no chance
that Mr. Douglas fathered that child.

969
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:37,794
Thank you, Eve.

970
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:15,709
This is a mistake.

971
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:18,344
You know? lt has to be, because...

972
01:30:18,613 --> 01:30:23,414
lt just has to be and they probably just
took the wrong sample or...

973
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:28,582
Or maybe l have the same initials, M.M.,
as someone else.

974
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:31,318
Marlene Morris, or...

975
01:30:31,793 --> 01:30:34,819
Yeah, but they're usually
kind of careful with this stuff.

976
01:30:34,896 --> 01:30:38,992
No. l'm telling you, doctors make mistakes.

977
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,497
l saw an entire documentary.

978
01:30:41,569 --> 01:30:44,129
They amputate the wrong leg all the time,

979
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:46,605
you have this one dying over here.

980
01:30:46,674 --> 01:30:50,110
You know, it's , like, a zoo at the hospital.

981
01:30:50,411 --> 01:30:52,902
Yeah, l don't know if that's the case.

982
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:55,676
-Hey, you know what? Just...
-l'm just saying.

983
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,809
Okay, well, l don't know
what you guys are saying,

984
01:30:57,885 --> 01:31:00,547
because all l know is, we

985
01:31:01,923 --> 01:31:05,689
were sexual
and then nine months later l had a kid.

986
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:07,560
Eight months.

987
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:11,690
Because Mattie was born
three and a half weeks premature.

988
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:13,558
Yeah, l know. l mean...

989
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:17,868
But when l got the ultrasound,
the doctor told me

990
01:31:18,206 --> 01:31:21,505
the exact day
of when we probably conceived.

991
01:31:22,076 --> 01:31:26,012
This would be one of those doctors
that amputates the wrong leg.

992
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,570
Jesus, Dennis, just...

993
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:36,487
Oh, my God.

994
01:31:38,392 --> 01:31:40,587
You know who the real guy is?

995
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:44,855
Yeah, his name was Rafael.

996
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:47,929
He was really nice.

997
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:51,832
He was, like, ltalian or French.

998
01:31:56,611 --> 01:31:58,340
What do you think you're going to do?

999
01:32:00,982 --> 01:32:02,449
l'm not sure.

1000
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:08,889
l guess l'll quit school and go back to work.

1001
01:32:10,224 --> 01:32:12,351
Find a daycare for Mattie,

1002
01:32:13,761 --> 01:32:18,061
but all the places l can afford
are so kind of depressing.

1003
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,195
But it'll be all right.

1004
01:32:21,269 --> 01:32:25,228
lt will, you know.
lt's going to be okay. lt's going to be okay.

1005
01:32:26,774 --> 01:32:28,241
lt always is.

1006
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:33,444
God, l shouldn't have ripped up that check.

1007
01:32:33,614 --> 01:32:34,808
Stupid.

1008
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:38,649
Sam, how do l open the big one?

1009
01:32:39,854 --> 01:32:41,321
Just don't ...

1010
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,949
l'm going to... Come on, kid.

1011
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:46,026
lt's a knife!

1012
01:32:49,864 --> 01:32:52,196
All right, Mattie. Come on, man.

1013
01:33:23,965 --> 01:33:26,866
l'm really, really so sorry about all this.

1014
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:31,599
You could've just loved him
and missed him,

1015
01:33:32,673 --> 01:33:33,935
and never known.

1016
01:33:34,008 --> 01:33:35,066
Him.

1017
01:33:36,844 --> 01:33:38,436
Never known him.

1018
01:33:43,818 --> 01:33:47,754
You know,
l just remembered something recently.

1019
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:55,327
About a year ago,
he and l spent a day on the river.

1020
01:33:55,496 --> 01:33:58,954
<i>He fished and I read.</i>
<i>It was one of those perfect days.</i>

1021
01:34:00,234 --> 01:34:04,227
<i>We were on our way home</i>
<i>and he said he had something to teII me.</i>

1022
01:34:04,438 --> 01:34:07,874
<i>I said, " Is it going to make me happier,</i>
<i>or Iess happy?"</i>

1023
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:10,105
<i>He said, " Less happy. "</i>

1024
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:12,007
<i>I said...</i>

1025
01:34:13,514 --> 01:34:15,277
<i>"Then don't teII me. "</i>

1026
01:34:25,793 --> 01:34:28,159
Ellen. Hi.

1027
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:31,860
l'd like to talk about the boy.

1028
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:34,924
The one that is definitely not my son's child.

1029
01:34:35,636 --> 01:34:39,094
Well, the one he decided to support
without a DNA test.

1030
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:46,673
Grady didn't need that money.

1031
01:34:47,081 --> 01:34:51,415
And he knew this kid's life
would be so much better with a little help.

1032
01:34:53,187 --> 01:34:54,950
What are you saying?

1033
01:34:56,090 --> 01:35:00,652
l'm saying if you don't give this child
what Grady wanted him to have

1034
01:35:01,629 --> 01:35:03,028
then l will.

1035
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:05,966
But you don't have money.

1036
01:35:06,033 --> 01:35:07,057
No.

1037
01:35:11,105 --> 01:35:12,834
But l do have this.

1038
01:35:17,645 --> 01:35:19,943
l don't want to sell it, Ellen.

1039
01:35:20,748 --> 01:35:23,376
l would so rather give it back to you.

1040
01:35:24,485 --> 01:35:28,751
But all l know is that for whatever reason,
Grady wanted this boy to be okay.

1041
01:36:02,323 --> 01:36:04,188
Look, the papaya lady!

1042
01:36:06,894 --> 01:36:10,125
Hey. You knew him, too?

1043
01:36:11,665 --> 01:36:13,155
He was my son.

1044
01:36:13,934 --> 01:36:15,902
l should've told you that.

1045
01:36:20,107 --> 01:36:21,597
God, that's ...

1046
01:36:21,942 --> 01:36:23,273
l'm sorry.

1047
01:36:25,946 --> 01:36:28,141
How did you know who we were?

1048
01:36:28,749 --> 01:36:30,273
lt was the hat.

1049
01:36:31,485 --> 01:36:33,783
Grady tied those flies himself.

1050
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:36,650
He did?

1051
01:36:40,594 --> 01:36:42,892
This is for you.

1052
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:46,959
Am l in trouble?

1053
01:36:47,868 --> 01:36:48,892
No.

1054
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:52,302
l figure you're going to pout all day
until l say this,

1055
01:36:52,373 --> 01:36:54,364
so l'm just going to put it out there.

1056
01:36:54,441 --> 01:36:56,238
You give good garden.

1057
01:36:56,911 --> 01:36:58,401
Thanks, buddy.

1058
01:36:59,547 --> 01:37:01,879
Hey, there's something l got to tell you.

1059
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:03,610
Yeah, what's that?

1060
01:37:03,918 --> 01:37:05,681
l found a new place.

1061
01:37:07,321 --> 01:37:09,050
New place for what?

1062
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:11,284
Really?

1063
01:37:13,227 --> 01:37:16,219
For me to live in.

1064
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:21,065
What? What? Wait! What?

1065
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:24,638
-You're moving out?
-Yes.

1066
01:37:25,072 --> 01:37:27,040
-Oh, my God, dude.
-Yeah, l know. l know.

1067
01:37:27,107 --> 01:37:29,598
-lt was just a fight, sir.
-Look, it's not about you.

1068
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:32,271
lt's just that it feels like time, man.

1069
01:37:32,346 --> 01:37:33,836
lt's not time.

1070
01:37:34,215 --> 01:37:37,343
lt was a small fight, sir. A tiny fight.
Like, we'll get over it, sir.

1071
01:37:37,418 --> 01:37:39,443
l'm not ready to live alone, Dennis.

1072
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,112
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1073
01:37:41,188 --> 01:37:45,318
lt's a great house
and l'm sure if you want to stay there,

1074
01:37:45,392 --> 01:37:47,553
you're not gonna have any trouble
finding another roommate.

1075
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:00,529
Ellen.

1076
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:04,300
lt was great what you did for them.

1077
01:38:06,247 --> 01:38:07,339
Here.

1078
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:10,309
Oh, no. You keep it.

1079
01:38:11,585 --> 01:38:16,352
Just promise me that the next person
who gets it, you'll tell them about him,

1080
01:38:17,091 --> 01:38:19,218
everything you can remember.

1081
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:22,226
l promise.

1082
01:38:23,297 --> 01:38:26,562
l didn't need the money. l never wanted it.

1083
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:28,329
Or the ring.

1084
01:38:31,538 --> 01:38:33,563
l just wanted my boy back.

1085
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:45,844
l didn't know everything about Grady.

1086
01:38:47,121 --> 01:38:49,419
Here's some of what l did know.

1087
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:52,820
<i>I toId them aII the great things</i>
<i>I know about you,</i>

1088
01:38:52,893 --> 01:38:55,487
<i>and there were a Iot. I was up there a whiIe.</i>

1089
01:38:55,562 --> 01:38:57,189
He loved coffee.

1090
01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:59,789
<i>I didn't teII them everything, though.</i>

1091
01:38:59,867 --> 01:39:02,529
<i>I Ieft out the compIicated stuff,</i>

1092
01:39:02,803 --> 01:39:06,603
<i>Iike how it took Iosing you forever</i>
<i>for me to truIy find you.</i>

1093
01:39:07,107 --> 01:39:10,668
<i>And how finding you</i>
<i>turned me into someone eIse entireIy.</i>

1094
01:39:11,145 --> 01:39:13,375
<i>That's not what they came for.</i>

1095
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:15,345
<i>PeopIe want to hear you were great.</i>

1096
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:19,113
<i>Not that you were great,</i>
<i>but aIso, sometimes, not so great.</i>

1097
01:39:19,987 --> 01:39:22,251
<i>They want to know I miss you.</i>

1098
01:39:22,556 --> 01:39:25,184
<i>Not that whiIe I've been missing you,</i>

1099
01:39:25,259 --> 01:39:27,454
<i>I've faIIen for someone eIse.</i>

1100
01:39:28,329 --> 01:39:30,024
<i>It's weird, though.</i>

1101
01:39:30,097 --> 01:39:33,589
<i>I feeI Iike the onIy one</i>
<i>who wouId understand it is you.</i>

1102
01:39:33,667 --> 01:39:34,861
<i>In a way, that makes sense.</i>

1103
01:39:34,935 --> 01:39:37,426
<i>He was the one person</i>
<i>you were yourseIf around.</i>

1104
01:39:37,504 --> 01:39:40,302
<i>Of course he'd be that same person for me.</i>

1105
01:39:40,474 --> 01:39:43,637
<i>Anyway, I Ieft aII that out</i>
<i>and I kept it simpIe.</i>

1106
01:39:44,211 --> 01:39:47,738
<i>I toId them I Ioved you and that's the truth.</i>

1107
01:40:01,862 --> 01:40:04,888
-Do l get my own bedroom?
-Yeah.

1108
01:40:04,965 --> 01:40:08,731
-Can l use the hockey table?
-Absolutely not.

1109
01:40:12,272 --> 01:40:13,899
Wait, which one are we taking?

1110
01:40:13,974 --> 01:40:16,602
Take the one upstairs on the left, Mo.

1111
01:40:20,948 --> 01:40:22,040
Whoa.

1112
01:40:23,884 --> 01:40:25,283
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1113
01:40:27,087 --> 01:40:31,251
Well, l just figured they should stick around
at least until winter

1114
01:40:31,325 --> 01:40:33,020
because the kid has never seen snow.

1115
01:40:33,093 --> 01:40:35,960
-What kind of craziness is that?
-Totally.

1116
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:40,826
That's a bold move, Samuel.

1117
01:40:40,934 --> 01:40:43,095
Well, as Helen Keller once said,

1118
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:47,004
<i>"</i>Life is either a daring adventure
or nothing<i>."</i>

1119
01:40:47,374 --> 01:40:48,705
Which tea?

1120
01:40:49,743 --> 01:40:52,974
Come on, sir.
l've been known to pick up a book.

1121
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:54,912
-Which tea?
-Tummy Mint.

1122
01:40:54,982 --> 01:40:57,780
Sam, are you bringing the bags?

1123
01:40:58,419 --> 01:40:59,647
-l'm ...
-You just...

1124
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:01,210
-Yeah, l'm on it.
-All right.

1125
01:41:09,496 --> 01:41:13,557
Oh, now, what the hell is this?
You're leaving, too? Come on, man.

1126
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:16,191
You have a very full house here, Sam.

1127
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:18,363
You don't need me. You'll be fine.

1128
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:20,566
Well, can l at least come visit you
at your new place,

1129
01:41:20,641 --> 01:41:24,077
maybe paint your walls
an inappropriate shade of blue?

1130
01:41:24,311 --> 01:41:25,903
Yes. Absolutely.

1131
01:41:26,447 --> 01:41:29,541
l'm just going to go on a quick trip
and then...

1132
01:41:29,783 --> 01:41:31,375
Where you going?

1133
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:34,186
Wait a second.

1134
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:35,278
No!

1135
01:41:41,695 --> 01:41:42,719
No!

1136
01:41:44,098 --> 01:41:45,895
Oh, you little tramp!

1137
01:41:56,910 --> 01:41:59,344
-You're really going.
-l really am.

1138
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:16,354
-l'll see you soon.
-Yeah. lt's okay.

1139
01:43:57,798 --> 01:43:58,958
Hello?

1140
01:44:04,972 --> 01:44:06,132
Hello?

1141
01:44:57,157 --> 01:45:00,092
Come here. Come here.

1142
01:45:01,528 --> 01:45:03,519
You ready? Okay, come on!

1143
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:47,372
l think l should have called.

1144
01:45:47,441 --> 01:45:50,433
You're probably busy
or on your way out, or...

1145
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:53,877
God, you could be seeing someone by now.
l hadn't thought of that.

1146
01:45:53,947 --> 01:45:57,508
Someone you met in a normal,
you know, uncomplicated...

1147
01:46:10,931 --> 01:46:12,796
What took you so long?
