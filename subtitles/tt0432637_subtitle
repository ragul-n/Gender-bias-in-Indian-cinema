1
00:00:32,882 --> 00:00:35,510
What a mess!

2
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:44,489
Krishna...Krishna...Krishna...

3
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:46,488
What am l going to do with this boy...?

4
00:01:13,222 --> 00:01:14,120
Krishna...

5
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,616
Yes, grandma?

6
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:17,792
Whose sketch book is this?

7
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,621
Mine, grandma.

8
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:21,958
And who made these sketches?

9
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:25,964
Grandma, why do grown ups sometimes
ask childish questions...?

10
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:29,137
lf it's my sketch book, obviously,
l've made the sketches.

11
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:34,799
Grown ups talk like children when
children act like grown ups.

12
00:01:35,044 --> 00:01:39,310
Tell me something, how did you make
such beautiful sketches?

13
00:01:39,448 --> 00:01:40,278
With this.

14
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:44,144
Like l've made your
sketch right now. See?

15
00:01:46,589 --> 00:01:47,647
Wow!

16
00:01:47,823 --> 00:01:49,154
Let me see!

17
00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:54,660
Rohit loved drawing too.

18
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:56,558
Papa made sketches too?

19
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:57,729
Yes.

20
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:04,002
When Rohit was your age and
he used to get tired studying

21
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:06,500
he used to sketch.

22
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:09,176
l want to be like my Papa too.

23
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:12,339
You are like your Papa!

24
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,848
Mrs Mehra, l've called you here
to tell you that...

25
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:20,682
we want to take Krishna's l.Q. test.

26
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:22,021
l.Q. test...?

27
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,017
But why, Father?

28
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,363
Krishna's absolutely normal.

29
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:29,690
No, Mrs Mehra.

30
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,028
He's not normal.

31
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:34,200
What are you saying, Father?

32
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,197
Are you telling me...

33
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:40,536
that Krishna is the same as
Rohit was in his childhood?

34
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:42,369
No, Father.

35
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,713
Krishna's a very bright child.

36
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:49,946
He scores very good marks, he
always gets A-plus grades.

37
00:02:50,252 --> 00:02:53,688
He even does his homework
without any help.

38
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,618
And that of other children too.

39
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:57,190
What?

40
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,758
This is the notebook of
a Class 3 student.

41
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:07,902
This is...

42
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,662
...Krishna's handwriting.

43
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:12,740
Yes, Krishna has done this
child's math homework.

44
00:03:17,713 --> 00:03:22,514
But how's that possible, Father?
Krishna's still in Class 1.

45
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,345
That's exactly why we wish to
take Krishna's l.Q. test...

46
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:33,251
so that we can ascertain just how bright,
sharp and ahead he is...

47
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:35,455
of other children his age

48
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:38,700
Krishna, how do you define amount?

49
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:43,334
Principle plus interest is equal to amount, sir

50
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:49,610
After what age does the brain
of a person stop growing?

51
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:53,804
Afterthe age of 15, Father.

52
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,865
What happened, Mrs Mehra?

53
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:19,431
The l.Q. test was going so well, Krishna
was answering all questions right...

54
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,335
That's exactly why l brought him away.

55
00:04:23,913 --> 00:04:24,641
But why?

56
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:29,377
You ought to be proud that
your grandson is so brilliant.

57
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:32,586
He's a genius, a miracle child.

58
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:39,124
Earlier it was a hunch
but now l'm sure.

59
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:42,764
The powers that Jadoo
had bestowed on Rohit...

60
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:48,464
...have been inherited by Krishna.

61
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:53,139
You will see, Mrs Mehra.
Like his father...

62
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:56,778
...Krishna will also achieve
great success.

63
00:04:57,413 --> 00:04:59,040
His name will appear in
the Guinness Book ...

64
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:03,415
...and the whole world will
speak highly of him.

65
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:07,548
That's exactly what l don't want, Father.

66
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:11,617
What did Rohit gain, after all?

67
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,298
They gave him medals, applauded him...

68
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,465
but everybody only used him..

69
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,370
...took advantage of him, Father.

70
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:26,504
And then...

71
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:35,039
...l lost my son and my daughter-in-law.

72
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:39,887
l don't want to lose Krishna now.

73
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,887
l don't want to lose him.

74
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:47,256
l can understand your concern and fears.

75
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:51,294
But destiny cannot be changed.

76
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:57,765
And talent is a gift which cannot be hidden.

77
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,867
l will hide it.

78
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:06,344
l'll take Krishna far away...

79
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:09,307
... very far.

80
00:07:57,493 --> 00:08:05,628
Krishna... Krishna...

81
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:10,837
Coming, Grandma!

82
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:15,473
Toofan, let's see who gets home first.

83
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,119
Hey... what did you see?

84
00:10:14,763 --> 00:10:19,427
As usual, l've seen nothing and
l won't say a word to anyone.

85
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:21,626
But as usual, l'll take
something from you.

86
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:24,762
Take this!

87
00:10:25,307 --> 00:10:29,903
l hide all your secrets and you
always give me jaggery?

88
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,442
lt won't work today.

89
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:35,742
Ok, ok, come home...
l'll give you Bournvita.

90
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:36,816
Bournvita?

91
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,819
Yes. Don't you want to be like me?

92
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:39,979
Yes!

93
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:41,817
So go, wear something below and come.

94
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:53,334
Krishna...

95
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:57,638
You've come?

96
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,338
Grandma, how do you know l've come?

97
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,972
l make no sound at all!

98
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:06,477
l can hearyour heartbeats.

99
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:08,149
But how, Grandma?

100
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:14,278
Your eyes say that you've been
upto mischief again.

101
00:11:14,523 --> 00:11:18,960
Mischief? Not at all, Grandma!

102
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:24,125
No mischief? Then why're you hiding
yourface like a thief?

103
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,458
Not hiding, just washing my face, Grandma

104
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:29,967
Ok ok.. lay the breakfast.

105
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:30,968
l've come!

106
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:02,033
What happened?

107
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:06,869
Chintu dropped a glass, Grandma...

108
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:08,702
Me?

109
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:12,046
Chintu! Upto mischief again?

110
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:15,379
Tell herthe truth, Krishna, else l shall.

111
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,878
Sure, go ahead

112
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:20,514
l'll tell her since you've asked me to

113
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:24,514
Grandma, Krishna was running faster
than Toofan today

114
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,320
What? Fasterthan Toofan?

115
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,623
So? What's the big deal?

116
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:30,832
And how about that?

117
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:32,659
What?

118
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:35,836
You climbed the mountain faster
than the monkeys...

119
00:12:36,471 --> 00:12:40,430
Grandma, you know that tall
mountain by the temple?

120
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,769
Krishna jumped from it
into the river.

121
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,606
l thought it was all over.
But he came back!

122
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:51,011
Krishna, why do you do such things?

123
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,980
l've forbidden you time and again!
Why do you still do such things?

124
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:57,816
What do l do Grandma?
You tell me!

125
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:01,925
How do l rid myself of loneliness?

126
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:04,257
Who do l make friends with?

127
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:08,930
Boys my age have gone away to the city,
to either study or earn a living

128
00:13:10,038 --> 00:13:12,268
And those that are here don't
want be friends with me

129
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:15,777
They say... l'm not like them

130
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:23,449
So l've made friends with
animals and birds

131
00:13:25,988 --> 00:13:28,456
Keep myself busy with nature.

132
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:32,786
But even out here in the open,
l sometimes feel stifled

133
00:13:35,497 --> 00:13:39,297
l feel like running far away
from here.

134
00:13:42,504 --> 00:13:44,802
Will you leave me and go away?

135
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:52,406
lt's because of you that l don't go!
Else, l'd have left long ago

136
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:09,656
Krishna has grown up, Rohit

137
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:16,498
l'm not sure how long l will be
able to hide him

138
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:22,167
Where is Sonia Mehra and her
grandson Krishna, Father?

139
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:27,671
lt's the third time in so many years
that l've come to ask you

140
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,180
And my answer is still the same.

141
00:14:31,553 --> 00:14:35,512
l have no idea where Mrs Mehra is.
l really don't know!

142
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:39,527
Why do you keep coming to me again
and again and waste my time?

143
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,659
Because you are the last link to
Rohit Mehra's family...

144
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:47,866
and you're the last person Sonia Mehra
met before she went missing

145
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,867
You know where they are,
but you're lying.

146
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,004
What?

147
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,274
You are lying, Father.

148
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,741
When l asked you whether Krishna possessed
the powers Rohit had...

149
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:05,151
you said he didn't.

150
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:09,650
But l was told...that the son was
betterthan his father

151
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,859
That he possesses all of Rohit's powers.
So tell me, Father...

152
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:17,665
l'll pay any price you ask

153
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,731
How dare you! Mr Sinha,
this is a school!

154
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:23,063
We don't indulge
in business here!

155
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,631
Please leave now!

156
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:31,706
You're making a mistake, Father.
A big mistake.

157
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:38,219
Krishna! Look!

158
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,822
What a huge kite!

159
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:50,991
But where's the string?

160
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:53,994
Must've snapped. Let's get it!

161
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,687
Don't scream! You needn't be afraid

162
00:18:03,231 --> 00:18:07,031
Close your eyes and hold on to me tightly

163
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:26,212
Stop screaming!

164
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:29,555
Else, l'll drop you.

165
00:18:31,092 --> 00:18:32,059
Close your eyes

166
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:35,725
Close your eyes, not widen them.

167
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:37,565
Close them!

168
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:39,400
Close!

169
00:18:58,787 --> 00:18:59,913
The glider came this way!

170
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:02,088
There it is!

171
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:03,750
Where...?

172
00:19:04,793 --> 00:19:05,760
Up there!

173
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:10,094
Oh my God! Where's Priya?

174
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:11,261
There!

175
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:24,941
She's breathing. She must've passed out

176
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:27,410
Let's take her back to the camp

177
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:37,950
The glider was at such a height,
Priya Ma'am was down here...

178
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,287
...and she's still breathing?
Just imagine!

179
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,626
Just imagine.

180
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:47,800
lmagine!

181
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,827
Where am l...?

182
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:14,825
You're alive and you're with us

183
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,827
Thank God you're alive.

184
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:20,827
Not God, it's that boy
we ought to thank

185
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:24,171
That boy...? Which boy?

186
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,004
The one who saved my life

187
00:20:29,377 --> 00:20:31,004
A boy saved you?

188
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:33,344
But there was no one there

189
00:20:33,548 --> 00:20:37,348
No sir! He must've been there!
We fell from the tree together.

190
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:42,011
Together...? But you went
in the glider alone.

191
00:20:42,257 --> 00:20:45,021
How did he come on
the tree to rescue you...?

192
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,018
Did he fall from the skies?

193
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:48,855
Yes sir. That's where he came from!

194
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:52,031
Priya, trust me, you were all alone. Right?

195
00:20:58,073 --> 00:20:58,869
Ghost!

196
00:20:59,074 --> 00:20:59,699
What happened?

197
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:01,709
G-H-O-S-T !

198
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,871
Komal sir, ghost!

199
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:07,540
Ghost?

200
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:17,955
What are you blabbering, Bahadur?

201
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,960
No blabber, sir. lt's a chant.
To drive the ghost away.

202
00:21:23,164 --> 00:21:26,292
What rubbish, Bahadur?
Ghost in broad daylight?

203
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:31,972
This is a jungle, sir! Night
and day are all the same here

204
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:34,141
Priya Ma'am, was he tall?

205
00:21:34,342 --> 00:21:35,309
Yes

206
00:21:36,344 --> 00:21:37,470
Well built?

207
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,646
Yes!

208
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:39,976
Fair-skinned?

209
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:40,806
Yes!

210
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:41,807
Kalicharan!

211
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,812
Kalicharan...?

212
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:44,984
Kalicharan...?

213
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:47,983
Yes, sir! Kalicharan's ghost!

214
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:51,825
Been wandering in the mountains
for ages... upside down on trees

215
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,322
Just imagine!

216
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:54,324
What nonsense!

217
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:58,160
A ghost in ourtimes...?
l don't believe all this.

218
00:21:58,366 --> 00:21:59,833
l also don't believe all this!

219
00:22:02,036 --> 00:22:02,832
What happened?

220
00:22:03,204 --> 00:22:04,171
What happened?

221
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:05,669
Relax...

222
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:12,839
Sir, it's either a sprain or a fracture

223
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:14,344
Oh no!

224
00:22:14,616 --> 00:22:16,675
We're here on a 10-day
adventure camp...

225
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:19,511
...and you've already broken yourfoot!

226
00:22:20,054 --> 00:22:23,512
Honey, take her into the tent
and give herfirst-aid

227
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:24,524
Careful...

228
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,795
Bahadur, go to your phone booth
and call for a car

229
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:37,805
We need to send Priya to
the city fortreatment

230
00:22:38,406 --> 00:22:41,034
l'll go at night, sir.
l feel scared by day.

231
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:42,038
What?

232
00:22:42,243 --> 00:22:44,040
Yes! Kalicharan's ghost.

233
00:22:44,245 --> 00:22:46,543
Scares people by day
and sleeps at night.

234
00:22:46,814 --> 00:22:47,712
Just imagine!

235
00:22:48,383 --> 00:22:49,350
Easy, easy

236
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:51,711
Just relax. l'll organise a painkiller

237
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,217
C'mon guys. Let's go

238
00:23:16,377 --> 00:23:19,005
You're always screaming!
Doesn't yourthroat hurt?

239
00:23:20,381 --> 00:23:21,848
Your eyes are widening again!

240
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:28,181
You must never get scared...

241
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,687
What happened, Priya?
Why were you screaming?

242
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:35,522
Honey, he was here! ln this room!
He was here, Honey!

243
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:38,030
Who...? Who was here?

244
00:23:38,566 --> 00:23:40,534
The boy who saved me
on the tree...

245
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:42,362
the one l told you about, sir...

246
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,197
God! What's happened to this girl?

247
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:50,036
Priya, it's just 2 seconds since l left...

248
00:23:50,311 --> 00:23:53,712
Are you saying that someone came
and even went away in the meantime...?

249
00:23:54,415 --> 00:23:56,212
You must've dozed off and
probably had a dream.

250
00:23:56,417 --> 00:23:59,875
l didn't dream! Why doesn't
someone believe me?

251
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:02,883
The moment l closed my eyes,
he entered the tent...

252
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:05,889
he twisted my ankle and the pain...

253
00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:11,224
Hey! The pain in my ankle is gone! See!

254
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:13,066
The pain has disappeared!

255
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:16,562
Oh my God sir! My foot is all right!

256
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:19,736
Look at this... l can jump!

257
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,406
My foot has become all right

258
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:27,578
Eitherthis girl has really gone mad,
or she's conning us!

259
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:32,913
No, sir! l'm not conning you! See...
l can jump! Believe me!

260
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:37,251
l believe you! Kalicharan has
cured yourfoot

261
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:38,220
Just imagine!

262
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,428
Kalicharan...? So this ghost
is also a doctor?

263
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:42,596
Not is, was!

264
00:24:42,797 --> 00:24:46,096
Kalicharan's father, Lalcharan.
Doctor Lalcharan.

265
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:51,768
There's no Kalicharan, there's
no Lalcharan... it's a pack of lies!

266
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:54,605
lt's some stupid local boy
playing a prank on me

267
00:24:54,976 --> 00:24:57,774
l'm going to find him today,
bring him before everybody...

268
00:24:57,979 --> 00:25:00,106
and prove to them that he's
just another boy!

269
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:00,940
Are you looking for someone?

270
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:02,116
What...?

271
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:05,952
You! l'm looking foryou!

272
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:09,314
Where do you keep disappearing?

273
00:25:09,524 --> 00:25:12,220
Why don't you appear before others
as you appear before me?

274
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:15,785
And that stupid Bahadur keeps telling
them that you're a ghost!

275
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,631
You... you're not Kalicharan, are you?

276
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:21,465
You're human, aren't you?

277
00:25:26,674 --> 00:25:27,436
Why are you kids giggling ?

278
00:25:27,742 --> 00:25:30,233
Who are you talking to, aunty?

279
00:25:30,578 --> 00:25:34,605
Aunty...? Firstly you call me aunty and
then you ask who l am speaking to?

280
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:36,283
l'm talking to this boy!

281
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:37,785
Which Boy?

282
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:41,952
Can't you see this boy here...?

283
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,450
That's a lamppost there, not a Boy,

284
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,627
That's a boy

285
00:25:48,496 --> 00:25:49,292
Lamppost

286
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:49,963
Boy!

287
00:25:50,164 --> 00:25:50,630
Lamppost!

288
00:25:50,832 --> 00:25:51,628
Shut up!

289
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:56,296
One moment. Please Listen...

290
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:02,805
What do you see there?
A boy? Or a lamppost?

291
00:26:03,678 --> 00:26:06,977
Well... there's neither a boy
there nor a lamppost.

292
00:26:07,181 --> 00:26:08,148
Look carefully...

293
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:16,314
What happened...?

294
00:26:17,925 --> 00:26:20,485
l'm feeling giddy.

295
00:26:20,928 --> 00:26:22,987
You seem unwell

296
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:27,495
My house is nearby...
come rest there for a while

297
00:26:28,202 --> 00:26:29,169
l'll get you a glass of water

298
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:29,836
Okay!

299
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,676
Why's his picture garlanded?

300
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:48,511
My son. He died 20 years ago

301
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:54,528
But how's that possible...?
Moments ago, l...

302
00:27:17,118 --> 00:27:20,747
lt's a tragic tale that took place
20 years ago

303
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,187
Champa and Kalicharan

304
00:27:24,892 --> 00:27:29,625
Kalicharan and Champa.
Madly in love with each other

305
00:27:29,897 --> 00:27:32,297
They were like one soul two bodies.

306
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,797
And then one day...

307
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:35,298
What happened?

308
00:27:35,503 --> 00:27:38,631
Kalicharan was putting some flowers
in Champa's hair...

309
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:41,809
Lalcharan happened to see them.

310
00:27:42,343 --> 00:27:44,971
He went red with rage!

311
00:27:45,513 --> 00:27:53,318
And one day, he deceived Champa into
drinking poison, in the name of medicine

312
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:59,323
And poor Champa! She screamed,
''Kali, Kali...''

313
00:27:59,861 --> 00:28:03,661
... and died. Just imagine!

314
00:28:04,198 --> 00:28:09,329
Kalicharan just could not bear
the pain of Champa's death

315
00:28:10,371 --> 00:28:13,169
Overthere! Look at that peak!

316
00:28:13,374 --> 00:28:20,837
From that very peak, Kalicharan
screamed, ''Champa, Champa...''

317
00:28:21,048 --> 00:28:24,677
... and jumped to his death!

318
00:28:25,052 --> 00:28:32,049
Ever since, Kalicharan's spirit has
been looking for his Champa!

319
00:28:32,393 --> 00:28:35,851
Why're you pointing towards me?

320
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,528
Because you are his Champa

321
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:41,030
Me...? Champa!

322
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:43,196
l mean, you look like Champa

323
00:28:44,972 --> 00:28:48,203
l'm feeling terribly scared. We can't
stay here anymore, please

324
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:49,706
Nobody goes anywhere!

325
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:55,875
This silly Bahadurtalks a lot of nonsense...

326
00:28:56,117 --> 00:28:57,709
...and you start imagining?

327
00:28:58,586 --> 00:29:03,546
Bahadur, you're not telling these kids
anymore stories. Understand?

328
00:29:05,593 --> 00:29:08,721
And now get ready. We're going
mountain-climbing

329
00:29:17,438 --> 00:29:19,406
You will use ascenders to climb...

330
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:23,408
...descenders to come down.

331
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,736
And you will come rappelling, down.

332
00:29:25,112 --> 00:29:26,238
'right sir.ok sir'

333
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:42,088
Ghost!

334
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:45,098
Priya!

335
00:30:06,654 --> 00:30:07,279
What... what on earth is that?

336
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,787
Kalicharan!

337
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:12,785
Just imagine

338
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:15,121
Can't imagine

339
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,298
Temperature. 104 degrees

340
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:23,627
We had told you sir.

341
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:26,298
But you didn't listen.

342
00:30:27,174 --> 00:30:28,141
Sorry, sorry

343
00:30:29,877 --> 00:30:31,845
We're not staying here any more

344
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,308
Bahadur, leave immediately.

345
00:30:35,516 --> 00:30:39,976
And arrange for
ourtransportation. Go!

346
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,485
You've snatched my bread and butter.

347
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:45,989
l'm broke even before l could
make some money.

348
00:30:46,193 --> 00:30:47,160
Just imagine!

349
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:52,358
Why did you climb the mountain
like that, in front of them?

350
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:56,168
What could l do? She screamed
so loudly...

351
00:30:57,371 --> 00:31:00,340
..that l got scared

352
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:05,668
And now they are so scared,
that they're all going back.

353
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:10,083
Now keep searching foryour
Champa all your life!

354
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:14,083
What do we do, Bahadur?

355
00:31:14,555 --> 00:31:18,184
How do l know? l did as you said

356
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,026
You think of a way now

357
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,362
ldea!

358
00:31:24,565 --> 00:31:25,031
What?

359
00:31:25,232 --> 00:31:26,028
Champa-ji...

360
00:31:30,738 --> 00:31:31,864
My name is Priya.

361
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:33,870
ln this lifetime

362
00:31:34,408 --> 00:31:38,367
ln your earlier six births you were
Kalicharan's Champa

363
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:40,046
This is your 7th birth.

364
00:31:40,247 --> 00:31:43,876
lf you leave without meeting him,
he'll be very angry...

365
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:47,213
And he'll follow you
whereveryou go

366
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,546
Just imagine!

367
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:53,049
How will he follow her?
We're going back to Singapore

368
00:31:53,294 --> 00:31:57,731
He can reach Singapore too!
He doesn't need airtickets

369
00:31:57,932 --> 00:32:01,732
Bahadur, she's not meeting any ghost!
What if something happens to her?

370
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:07,065
This ghost is a gentleman, ma'am.
He hasn't harmed a soul

371
00:32:07,274 --> 00:32:07,899
Am l right?

372
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:09,601
Yes

373
00:32:10,177 --> 00:32:12,577
l leave the rest to you

374
00:32:14,782 --> 00:32:15,578
Wait Bahadur!

375
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:19,578
Honey...

376
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:20,583
Yes?

377
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:23,082
l think he's right

378
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,085
You're going to meet him?

379
00:32:25,392 --> 00:32:28,725
Yes. Only then will he find peace

380
00:32:28,996 --> 00:32:31,089
And you better not stop her

381
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:36,231
if Kalicharan gets to know...
just imagine!

382
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,266
No! l wasn't stopping her!

383
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,599
l was only advising you, right...?

384
00:32:41,976 --> 00:32:46,936
Listen, you must meet the ghost.
He's such a gentleman!

385
00:32:47,214 --> 00:32:48,613
l'm off to sleep.
Bye, good night!

386
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:59,625
Champa... Champa...

387
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:31,316
Hello! Kalicharan ji...

388
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:32,993
Here l am...

389
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:36,159
... to help you get peace

390
00:33:36,363 --> 00:33:38,831
Please... could you appear
before me?

391
00:33:44,872 --> 00:33:46,840
''l feel scared''

392
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,002
Do ghosts also feel
scared nowadays?

393
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:57,483
''l'm not a ghost''

394
00:33:58,886 --> 00:34:00,683
You aren't a ghost?

395
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:04,020
Oh yes, l get it...

396
00:34:04,892 --> 00:34:08,350
it offends you when someone calls
you a ghost, isn't it?

397
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:14,023
And you're right! You've ended
your life for love

398
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:18,863
And those who end their lives
for love aren't ghosts...

399
00:34:19,406 --> 00:34:22,034
They are... they are...

400
00:34:23,077 --> 00:34:26,205
They're lovers! You're
a lover, aren't you?

401
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:28,044
l'm Krishna

402
00:34:39,493 --> 00:34:42,223
Look... stay right there!

403
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:44,225
Don't come closer, okay?

404
00:34:44,598 --> 00:34:47,226
You sent for me
and here l am.

405
00:34:47,768 --> 00:34:49,565
You'll get peace now

406
00:34:50,104 --> 00:34:51,071
May l go now?

407
00:34:51,438 --> 00:34:54,066
All l want is friendship

408
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:56,235
Friendship...?

409
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:01,576
Hey... don't be afraid.
l'm as human as you are

410
00:35:02,216 --> 00:35:04,878
Touch me if you can't
believe that.

411
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:06,577
Touch you?

412
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:11,921
l'm sorry

413
00:35:14,628 --> 00:35:16,926
See? The colour of my blood
is red, too.

414
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:18,925
Are you convinced now
that l'm not a ghost?

415
00:35:20,134 --> 00:35:23,763
lf you're not a ghost then
that picture?

416
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:29,104
That's my father's photograph.
He's no more

417
00:35:29,476 --> 00:35:30,773
l look exactly like him.

418
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,436
l see

419
00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:38,107
But the other day, how did you suddenly
get on that tree to save my life?

420
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:42,117
And yesterday! How did you climb
that mountain so fast?

421
00:35:43,824 --> 00:35:46,292
Maybe because l've got used to it

422
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:52,863
Right from my childhood, l've grown up
playing among the trees and mountains...

423
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:55,465
...with the birds and the animals.
l spend most of my time here

424
00:35:55,836 --> 00:35:57,861
l guess that's why they're my friends

425
00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:00,470
Would you like to
meet my friends?

426
00:36:19,693 --> 00:36:23,060
Wow! l still can't believe it!

427
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:28,297
l won't let you poke that pin again!
lt hurts because l'm not Kalicharan.

428
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,840
See? He's not Kalicharan!
l've always been saying that!

429
00:36:38,078 --> 00:36:39,841
That's what you're still saying.

430
00:36:44,852 --> 00:36:46,080
l'm Right!

431
00:36:49,523 --> 00:36:52,754
Kalicharan! You're so cute!

432
00:36:53,227 --> 00:36:57,857
Krishna, you really got us scared.
But that was a nice prank.

433
00:36:58,899 --> 00:37:02,198
Boys and girls,
camping continues!

434
00:37:02,903 --> 00:37:05,201
Krishna, you also join the group!

435
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:38,901
Just imagine!

436
00:37:49,683 --> 00:37:50,911
C'mon! C'mon!

437
00:38:46,673 --> 00:38:47,640
Come

438
00:39:24,778 --> 00:39:27,178
From where are you getting a flower of
a new colour every time, Krishna?

439
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:28,507
From the rainbow.

440
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:31,180
The rainbow?

441
00:39:31,552 --> 00:39:32,519
Yes

442
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,846
Look

443
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:51,868
Wow Krishna! lt's such
a beautiful sight

444
00:39:53,574 --> 00:39:57,533
Had l not come here, l'd really
have regretted it

445
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,204
So would l

446
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:07,048
l've never seen such a lovely place.

447
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:15,057
lt's so beautiful. So pure,
so serene, so quiet

448
00:40:16,263 --> 00:40:17,730
You should see this place in autumn.

449
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:20,231
lt's a riot of colours

450
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:25,070
When the sunrays touch the
fallen leaves, everything turns to gold

451
00:40:25,606 --> 00:40:26,732
lt's so beautiful

452
00:40:27,774 --> 00:40:30,436
Makes you realise what
a great artist God really is

453
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,644
Krishna, you speak English?

454
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:36,749
And with such fluency?

455
00:40:37,784 --> 00:40:43,086
Grandma taught me. She's my
school, my college and my university

456
00:40:43,624 --> 00:40:47,583
But you need talent to
learn anything, Krishna

457
00:40:47,794 --> 00:40:49,421
And you possess amazing talent.

458
00:40:49,796 --> 00:40:50,922
You're amazing!

459
00:40:51,865 --> 00:40:55,266
You shouldn't be wasting your
talent in this remote village

460
00:40:55,469 --> 00:40:57,266
You ought to get out of here.

461
00:40:57,638 --> 00:40:59,265
People in the world out there...

462
00:40:59,473 --> 00:41:03,102
...not just need talented people
like you, they appreciate them too

463
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:07,777
But my grandma is my world

464
00:41:08,982 --> 00:41:11,780
l will never leave her.

465
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,447
You love your grandma
very much?

466
00:41:16,456 --> 00:41:17,855
More than very much

467
00:41:17,991 --> 00:41:20,391

your grandma

Hello, Grandma

We've met before.

495
00:46:05,745 --> 00:46:07,906
l remember. Tell me something...

496
00:46:08,415 --> 00:46:10,883
Why did you go away, the other day?

497
00:46:11,184 --> 00:46:13,084
l fled, grandma! Out of fright

498
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:16,480
Krishna was playing a ghost
to scare us

was trembling in his boots!

He was down with 104 degrees fever!

What? 104 degrees?

503
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,432
ls that true, Krishna?

504
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,639
You shouldn't play such pranks
on anyone, my son

505
00:46:37,978 --> 00:46:39,468
Why scare someone so much?

506

Did you apologise?

00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,948
Yes, Grandma. To everybody

00:48:33,426 --> 00:48:35,155
l'm going to miss this place...

536
00:48:36,763 --> 00:48:37,957
And you, too.

537
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:41,293
Look afteryourself, Kalicharan.

538
00:48:43,103 --> 00:48:44,400
l have to go now.

539
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,707
May l?

540
00:48:51,444 --> 00:48:52,411
May l go?

541
00:48:55,615 --> 00:48:59,608
Krishna, how will she go,
if you don't leave her hand?

542
00:49:04,257 --> 00:49:05,315
Bye, Krishna

543
00:49:06,493 --> 00:49:07,289
Bye

544
00:49:26,446 --> 00:49:29,176
Priya... See!

545
00:50:03,483 --> 00:50:06,247
Looks like you're no longer Priya.
You've become Radha.

546
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,782
Krishna's Radha.

547
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:11,485
What?

548
00:50:12,292 --> 00:50:16,922
l seriously think Krishna has
fallen in love with you.

549
00:50:23,703 --> 00:50:24,897
l hope not...

550
00:50:53,466 --> 00:50:57,493
Honey, pray that the boss' mood is ok,
we're five days late.

551
00:51:05,478 --> 00:51:07,036
Hi! Honey. Hi! Priya

552
00:51:09,415 --> 00:51:10,939
We are saying hi to them,

553
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,583
Why're they waving five fingers at us?

554
00:51:12,785 --> 00:51:15,379
Stupid! The five fingers
stand forfive days.

555
00:51:15,588 --> 00:51:17,556
Oh my God! You mean boss too...

556
00:51:22,595 --> 00:51:24,358
You took a leave of 15 days...

557
00:51:24,697 --> 00:51:26,324
...and have come after 20!

558
00:51:26,866 --> 00:51:29,892
So you girls are now fired!

559
00:51:30,904 --> 00:51:34,601
Why just lndia?
Go on a world tour! Go!

560
00:51:38,344 --> 00:51:39,208
Stop, Priya.

561
00:51:40,613 --> 00:51:43,639
Sorry boss, but you can't insult us.

562
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:45,542
Yeah?

563
00:51:45,785 --> 00:51:46,615
Yeah!

564
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:52,256
Boss, you can't question
our integrity.

565
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:54,392
Agreed we were on a leave
of 15 days

566
00:51:54,594 --> 00:51:58,690
But on the 16th day we got to work

567
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,667
What amazing work have you done?

568
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,769
We have found an lndian superboy.

569
00:52:04,971 --> 00:52:06,598
Honey! What are you saying?

570
00:52:06,806 --> 00:52:08,364
Let me speak, please.

571
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:14,169
Boss, this boy scales high mountains
as if they were mere steps for him!

572
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,209
He runs fasterthan a horse!

573
00:52:16,482 --> 00:52:17,380
And guess what?

574
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:20,118
He puts his hand in the river
and pulls out fish!

575
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:28,452
Just think of it, if a boy as talented
as him were to come here...

576
00:52:29,162 --> 00:52:33,121
...your rating's are going to soar!
Just imagine!

577
00:52:35,501 --> 00:52:39,801
l hope you're not trying to make
a fool out of me?

578
00:52:40,506 --> 00:52:44,966
No way, boss!
You will believe it too...

579
00:52:45,178 --> 00:52:49,615
...when you see him doing all those
incredible things here!

580
00:52:49,816 --> 00:52:53,650
See him here! How? How's he going
to come here?

581
00:52:54,587 --> 00:52:57,647
l tried to stop you, but you just
wouldn't listen!

582
00:52:58,324 --> 00:53:03,728
Please, Priya! There was no other way
of saving our job.

583
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:07,366
Besides, what's wrong if Krishna
comes here?

584
00:53:07,567 --> 00:53:09,330
There you go again!

585
00:53:09,535 --> 00:53:11,332
Relax! Sit down

586
00:53:11,637 --> 00:53:16,074
lf Krishna's talents are
showcased on our channel...

587
00:53:16,275 --> 00:53:19,438
...he'd be the one who'd gain.
Name, fame, money...

588
00:53:19,645 --> 00:53:23,240
He'll have everything!
He'll be a big man!

589
00:53:23,449 --> 00:53:24,575
Just think!

590
00:53:27,653 --> 00:53:29,314
l know you're right, Honey...

591
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:33,388
...but Krishna will never leave
his grandma and come.

592
00:53:34,727 --> 00:53:36,319
She is his world.

593
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:40,199
But now you are a part
of his world too.

594
00:53:41,734 --> 00:53:46,865
l know. Now do as l say.

595
00:53:47,073 --> 00:53:49,473
Call for Krishna!

596
00:53:51,077 --> 00:53:52,374
Phone...

597
00:53:53,646 --> 00:53:54,977
Phone...

598
00:53:56,916 --> 00:53:59,384
Krishna, phone

599
00:54:01,788 --> 00:54:02,948
He's coming!

600
00:54:03,456 --> 00:54:04,388
Who's coming?

601
00:54:04,757 --> 00:54:08,989
A boy? ls he an lndian?
Does he live here in Singapore?

602
00:54:09,328 --> 00:54:11,228
Have you finally chosen
someone, Priya?

603
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:14,127
There you go again, Mom!
l haven't chosen anyone

604
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:15,425
So choose one!

605
00:54:15,635 --> 00:54:16,294
l will...

606
00:54:16,502 --> 00:54:18,629
...please leave now,
we got to save our jobs.

607
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:19,634
And when will you settle down?

608
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:20,430
Tomorrow

609
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,005
Call from Priya!

610
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:23,504
Priya?

611
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:25,238
Hello, Krishna...

612
00:54:25,445 --> 00:54:26,139
Priya...

613
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,644
How are you?

614
00:54:29,348 --> 00:54:32,078
l'm fine, but l don't like anything

615
00:54:33,352 --> 00:54:34,250
Me too

616
00:54:35,788 --> 00:54:37,312
l can't sleep

617
00:54:38,724 --> 00:54:39,486
Me too

618
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,818
l want to meet you

619
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:45,654
Me too

620
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:49,563
He's not saying anything more than
'' Me too '', so what do l do?

621
00:54:49,769 --> 00:54:51,862
You continue reading,
read from here!

622
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,567
Priya, why are you quiet?

623
00:54:55,241 --> 00:54:58,768
Krishna, can't you come here
and meet my mother?

624
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,042
Your mother?

625
00:55:00,246 --> 00:55:03,272
Yes, if you don't meet my mother...

626
00:55:03,483 --> 00:55:06,213
...she'll get me married to
someone else.

627
00:55:07,487 --> 00:55:08,454
Someone else?

628
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,114
No, l won't let that happen!

629
00:55:11,324 --> 00:55:13,758
l'm coming there, Priya!

630
00:55:15,361 --> 00:55:19,695
But...how will l get there?

631
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,693
Yes... how will you get here?

632
00:55:23,669 --> 00:55:27,435
Hello, Krishna! Don't worry.
Just give the phone to Bahadur?

633
00:55:41,988 --> 00:55:47,824
Krishna! Aircraft! Singapore!
Priya Ma'am!

634
00:55:48,027 --> 00:55:49,858
How? When?

635
00:55:54,767 --> 00:55:56,735
Just imagine!

636

''Come, let me tell you
a love story''

638
00:56:23,496 --> 00:56:27,523
''There was a boy and
there was a girl...''

639
00:56:52,959 --> 00:56:55,655
''She smiled''

640
00:56:55,861 --> 00:56:58,830
''He smiled''

641
00:56:59,031 --> 00:57:05,231
''Little did they know what
was happening''

642
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:36,992
ADLABS

643
00:57:52,885 --> 00:57:58,755
''What they couldn't say till then,

00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:05,887

''lt brings a smile to my face to
see us falling in love...''

647
00:58:41,067 --> 00:58:44,400
''We're lost in love''

648
00:58:47,473 --> 00:58:51,671
''The world didn't matterto them
anymore''

649
00:58:53,546 --> 00:58:57,744
''There was a boy
and there was a girl...''

00:58:59,518 --> 00:59:04,854
''she smiled, he smiled...''

651
00:59:05,057 --> 00:59:11,428
''little did they know what
was happening''

652
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:15,964
''Come, let me tell you a love story''

''There was a boy and there was a girl...''

''Oh, how one heart ruled the other!''

662
01:00:35,581 --> 01:00:40,314
''There was a boy and there was a girl...''

663
01:00:48,994 --> 01:00:49,517
Grandma!

664
01:00:49,728 --> 01:00:50,786
l am here

665
01:00:50,996 --> 01:00:52,463
Grandma!

666
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:55,793
Grandma!

667
01:00:56,001 --> 01:00:56,797
Put me down

668
01:00:59,905 --> 01:01:01,031
What's the matter, Krishna?

669
01:01:01,841 --> 01:01:03,206
You look very happy today.

670
01:01:03,843 --> 01:01:05,970
Grandma, l got a call from Priya!

671
01:01:06,345 --> 01:01:08,313
You told me that she'd forget me?

672
01:01:08,681 --> 01:01:11,479
But it's not true, Grandma!
She misses me every moment.

673
01:01:11,684 --> 01:01:14,812
She's always thinking of me!
And she keeps seeing me everywhere!

674
01:01:17,356 --> 01:01:20,325
And l nevertold you...

675
01:01:23,229 --> 01:01:24,662
...l've been in a similar state.

676
01:01:26,198 --> 01:01:29,224
Ever since Priya has left,
l never liked anything.

677
01:01:31,136 --> 01:01:34,663
But today with her call,
l feel better.

678
01:01:35,474 --> 01:01:37,840
Grandma, Priya has called me
to Singapore

679
01:01:38,043 --> 01:01:39,510
She wants me to meet her mother.

680
01:01:40,045 --> 01:01:40,670
Her mother?

681
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,505
Yes

682
01:01:41,714 --> 01:01:42,510
lf l don't go and ask for her hand...

683
01:01:42,715 --> 01:01:45,513
...her mother's going to get her
married to someone else

684
01:01:46,886 --> 01:01:49,013
l said l wouldn't let that happen,
l'm coming.

685
01:01:50,956 --> 01:01:53,857
l did the right thing, didn't l Grandma?
May l go, Grandma?

686
01:02:01,066 --> 01:02:02,693
lt's only a matter of a few days, grandma

687
01:02:02,902 --> 01:02:06,201
l'll ask for Priya's hand in marriage
and bring her back with me

688
01:02:08,741 --> 01:02:09,799
May l go, Grandma?

689
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:16,104
You're not answering, Grandma

690
01:02:18,851 --> 01:02:21,376
When you've already decided to go...

691
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,782
...why ask me?

692
01:02:25,758 --> 01:02:28,556
Go on. Go.

693
01:02:29,528 --> 01:02:30,722
You aren't happy, Grandma?

694
01:02:32,031 --> 01:02:34,397
Don't you like Priya?

695
01:02:36,201 --> 01:02:37,395
l like Priya...

696
01:02:38,938 --> 01:02:41,304
...but l don't like the idea
of you going so far.

697
01:02:42,775 --> 01:02:44,834
lf Priya really loves you...

698
01:02:45,778 --> 01:02:48,406
...she can also come here
with her mother

699
01:02:49,615 --> 01:02:51,139
But you're not going there!

700
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,681
Why not?

701
01:02:54,219 --> 01:02:58,087
l said you're not going,
it means you're not going

702
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:00,750
That's it!

703
01:03:01,126 --> 01:03:03,924
But why can't l go?
What's going to happen?

704
01:03:04,797 --> 01:03:05,923
l've been hearing this since l was a child!

705
01:03:06,131 --> 01:03:08,759
Don't go here, don't go there,
don't do this, don't do that...

706
01:03:08,968 --> 01:03:10,435
...don't go to the city with yourfriends!

707
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:13,766
Forget the city, you don't even
allow me to go beyond the river...

708
01:03:14,006 --> 01:03:14,700
Why?

709
01:03:17,977 --> 01:03:23,210
Now you've become so big that
l have to give explanations to you?

710
01:03:27,987 --> 01:03:29,614
You'll have to tell today, Grandma!

711
01:03:30,823 --> 01:03:32,017
Why do you keep stopping me?

712
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:33,685
Why can't l go anywhere?

713
01:03:35,995 --> 01:03:39,294
Because l don't want to lose you

714
01:03:40,332 --> 01:03:41,629
So what do you want then?

715
01:03:42,001 --> 01:03:45,368
Cut me off from the world and
keep looking at yourface forever?

716
01:03:45,904 --> 01:03:47,804
Bang my head on trees
and mountains all my life...?

717
01:03:48,007 --> 01:03:50,305
You want me to be alone all my life?
ls that what you want?

718
01:03:57,683 --> 01:04:01,312
But l can't do l that, Grandma!
l have my own life too...

719
01:04:01,687 --> 01:04:04,986
...my own dreams. l too want to
achieve something!

720
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:06,657
l want an identity for myself!

721
01:04:11,096 --> 01:04:14,998
You don't want to lose me,
even if l have to lose Priya

722
01:04:16,201 --> 01:04:18,328
You can't see me happy

723
01:04:19,872 --> 01:04:24,332
l have always obeyed you.
And you can't agree to my one request?

724
01:04:25,711 --> 01:04:28,009
Today l realize, how selfish you are!

725
01:04:29,548 --> 01:04:32,517
You only think of yourself!
Only yourself!

726
01:04:33,552 --> 01:04:35,520
You don't care for me!

727
01:04:36,221 --> 01:04:39,850
Had my parents been alive,
they'd have understood my feelings!

728
01:04:40,059 --> 01:04:42,027
They'd have let me go,
they wouldn't have stopped me!

729
01:04:52,504 --> 01:04:55,200
l wish your parents were alive.

730
01:04:57,242 --> 01:04:58,539
l wish!

731
01:05:27,272 --> 01:05:28,136
l'm sorry, Grandma.

732
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:41,911
See these stars, Krishna...

733
01:05:44,923 --> 01:05:49,690
...with these infinite
twinkling stars in the sky...

734
01:05:50,562 --> 01:05:56,523
...you, yourfather, your grandfather...

735
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,669
...and l share a very deep relationship.

736
01:06:01,807 --> 01:06:04,105
Your grandfather was a space scientist

737
01:06:05,244 --> 01:06:11,672
One night, he started receiving a reply
to a signal he had sent to outer space

738
01:06:12,417 --> 01:06:14,510
Suddenly, we saw a flying saucer in the sky...

739
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,779
...the car swerved out of control

740
01:06:16,989 --> 01:06:19,787
l survived the accident...

741
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:21,456
...but your grandfather.

742
01:06:27,499 --> 01:06:29,524
l was pregnant with Rohit at that time...

743
01:06:31,436 --> 01:06:33,961
...he had sustained a head injury
in the accident...

744
01:06:35,174 --> 01:06:37,301
...because of which he was born abnormal.

745
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:43,646
...even when he grew up,
he had the l.Q. of a child.

746
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:49,653
One night, in our small town,
a huge spaceship descended.

747
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:54,149
Some Aliens emerged from it...

748
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:57,158
...but one could not go back.

749
01:06:58,197 --> 01:07:01,997
And that is how Rohit met Jadoo.

750
01:07:03,368 --> 01:07:06,667
Jadoo had supernatural powers...

751
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:10,841
...which he passed on to Rohit.

752
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:13,935
Rohit changed completely.

753
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,004
Jadoo eventually went away...

754
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:23,453
...but he did not take back the powers
he had given to Rohit.

755
01:07:24,723 --> 01:07:29,524
And thereafter, everything changed forever.

756
01:07:30,896 --> 01:07:37,802
My son could do things that were impossible
for an ordinary human being.

757
01:07:41,073 --> 01:07:43,735
lt was around then that Rohit
married your mother.

758
01:07:45,177 --> 01:07:50,615
And very soon, his fame spread
across the world.

759
01:07:52,251 --> 01:07:56,381
The chairman of the world's largest
lnformation Technology Company...

760
01:07:57,422 --> 01:07:59,219
...invited Rohit abroad.

761
01:08:07,766 --> 01:08:08,391
Thank You.

762
01:08:15,374 --> 01:08:16,671
Welcome to Technotronics.

763
01:08:17,776 --> 01:08:18,572
Come with me, Sir

764
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,747
Dr Arya shall be here shortly

765
01:08:48,307 --> 01:08:49,706
Mr. Rohit Mehra?

766
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:53,437
l'm sorry to keep you waiting

767
01:08:54,146 --> 01:08:55,113
lt's all right, Sir.

768
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,447
l was, this book...

769
01:08:56,648 --> 01:09:02,280
Oh yes, that's the first copy of
my latest book.

770
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:04,689
Please read it and give your opinion.

771
01:09:05,157 --> 01:09:08,024
lt's a wonderful book, Sir.
You've done a lot of research.

772
01:09:08,827 --> 01:09:11,295
How can you say that without reading it?

773
01:09:11,496 --> 01:09:12,554
l've already read it, Sir.

774
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:15,633
Read it?

775
01:09:17,502 --> 01:09:21,438
There are printing errors on
page 126, 244 and 354

776
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:22,972
l've marked them.

777
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:28,372
You've read this 400 page book
in just 10 minutes?

778
01:09:32,351 --> 01:09:34,911
l forgot who l was talking to.

779
01:09:35,053 --> 01:09:39,149
Asking you such questions is
an insult to yourtalent.

780
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:41,821
lt's an honourto meet you.

781
01:09:43,028 --> 01:09:44,256
The honour is mine, Sir.

782
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:46,824
l still can't believe...

783
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:49,997
...that l'm standing face to face with a
great scientist and innovator like you.

784
01:09:50,869 --> 01:09:52,837
Your achievements in the field of
wireless communication...

785
01:09:53,038 --> 01:09:54,835
...is no less than a revolution, Sir.

786
01:09:55,273 --> 01:09:58,470
You've invented the palmtop.

787
01:09:59,077 --> 01:10:03,241
People can watch cricket matches
on their phones, thanks to you.

788
01:10:06,718 --> 01:10:10,848
l have a new dream, Rohit. A new vision...

789
01:10:11,723 --> 01:10:19,630
...lf this dream comes true, it could change
the destiny of the world.

790
01:10:21,066 --> 01:10:24,695
And l need your help to realise this dream.

791
01:10:26,405 --> 01:10:32,037
l want to build a computer
that can see the future.

792
01:10:32,244 --> 01:10:33,643
That can see the future.

793
01:10:36,648 --> 01:10:37,376
Future?

794
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:41,285
What would you like, tea or coffee?

795
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:53,226
l understand your dream, your vision, Sir.

796
01:10:55,033 --> 01:10:59,561
You want to combine astrology,
astronomy and technology...

797
01:11:00,038 --> 01:11:03,565
...to build a computerthat can see the future.

798
01:11:03,775 --> 01:11:07,472
Exactly! That's precisely
why l've called you here.

799
01:11:08,346 --> 01:11:11,907
Because the people l have here are trained...

800
01:11:13,051 --> 01:11:14,916
...not gifted like you.

801
01:11:29,401 --> 01:11:30,766
What are you thinking, Rohit?

802
01:11:32,537 --> 01:11:40,034
Sir, if we can really build a computer
that can see the future then...

803
01:11:40,245 --> 01:11:46,115
Then, think of the good we can do
forthis planet and mankind!

804
01:11:46,318 --> 01:11:47,615
Wars can be prevented

805
01:11:47,819 --> 01:11:51,880
Earthquakes, famines, floods,
can be prevented.

806
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:54,957
Even if we can't prevent them,
we can at least be prepared forthem.

807
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:58,288
You've already started
seeing the future, Rohit.

808
01:11:59,331 --> 01:12:00,127
Welcome!

809
01:12:00,999 --> 01:12:06,960
ln the hope that this union of brilliance
and vision will become history.

810
01:12:07,839 --> 01:12:09,306
Create history!

811
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:14,874
lt took him two whole years...

812
01:12:16,548 --> 01:12:20,644
...but Rohit achieved the impossible...

813
01:12:22,187 --> 01:12:26,988
...he built a computer
that could see the future...

814
01:12:29,794 --> 01:12:33,321
...lt was around the time
when you were going to be born.

815
01:12:33,698 --> 01:12:36,326
Hello?- Mom?

816
01:12:36,535 --> 01:12:38,162
Rohit, l've brought Nisha to the hospital.

817
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:39,496
That's where l'm calling from.

818
01:12:39,804 --> 01:12:42,773
Congratulations! You're going to
become a father anytime.

819
01:12:44,609 --> 01:12:46,236
Come back soon.

820
01:12:46,444 --> 01:12:48,503
l'm coming, Mom...l'm coming!

821
01:12:50,549 --> 01:12:55,509
Rohit? What's the matter?
You sound tense.

822
01:12:55,787 --> 01:12:59,848
l've been exploited. The world is very selfish

823
01:13:00,225 --> 01:13:03,592
But don't worry! l'll be back soon!

824
01:13:04,896 --> 01:13:07,023
But my son did not come back.

825
01:13:09,801 --> 01:13:14,261
Moments afteryou were born,
we received word

826
01:13:16,675 --> 01:13:18,870
...that a fire broke out in the lab...

827
01:13:20,845 --> 01:13:25,873
...and they couldn't save Rohit.

828
01:13:29,688 --> 01:13:32,213
Your mother couldn't bearthe shock...

829
01:13:33,358 --> 01:13:36,816
...and passed away in a few days.

830
01:13:40,599 --> 01:13:42,226
When you were five years old...

831
01:13:44,436 --> 01:13:49,237
...l got to know that you too were
born with extraordinary powers...

832
01:13:49,674 --> 01:13:54,077
...that Rohit had. l got scared.

833
01:13:55,447 --> 01:14:03,252
l didn't want the world to know about you.

834
01:14:04,222 --> 01:14:07,191
And that's why l brought you here...

835
01:14:08,126 --> 01:14:09,753
...a place where nobody knew us.

836
01:14:11,963 --> 01:14:16,423
l didn't want to lose you at any cost, Krishna.

837
01:14:20,338 --> 01:14:22,363
You no longer want to see my face...

838
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:28,768
...but l'm living only foryou, Krishna

839
01:14:32,917 --> 01:14:38,219
Yes, l'm selfish, very selfish.

840
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,884
Grandma? What are you doing?

841
01:15:18,296 --> 01:15:20,662
l've taken out some of
yourfather's clothes.

842
01:15:21,866 --> 01:15:24,994
You can't go to Singapore like this!

843
01:15:28,373 --> 01:15:30,671
But Grandma?

844
01:15:34,379 --> 01:15:36,506
l could shield you from the world...

845
01:15:37,716 --> 01:15:39,240
...but not your heart.

846
01:15:40,385 --> 01:15:44,685
Go, bring Priya here.

847
01:15:48,727 --> 01:15:49,955
Krishna...

848
01:15:53,064 --> 01:15:54,622
...stay carefully there

849
01:15:55,400 --> 01:16:00,360
Eat and sleep on time,
don't talk too much with anybody.

850
01:16:01,239 --> 01:16:03,036
And don't get into any trouble...

851
01:16:03,975 --> 01:16:08,173
...whateveryou do, make sure you
behave like any other man.

852
01:16:09,581 --> 01:16:15,144
Don't get carried away to do things
that make people realise...

853
01:16:17,188 --> 01:16:20,214
Who l am? Right, Grandma?

854
01:16:21,826 --> 01:16:22,724
Yes, my son.

855
01:16:24,095 --> 01:16:26,063
Don't worry, Grandma.

856
01:16:27,031 --> 01:16:29,397
l won't let anybody know about me.

857
01:16:30,368 --> 01:16:36,068
l'll keep my strength, my abilities
and my talent... hidden.

858
01:16:40,111 --> 01:16:41,578
That's a promise, Grandma.

859
01:17:12,143 --> 01:17:14,111
Welcome to Singapore, Sir.
- Thank you.

860
01:17:14,979 --> 01:17:19,279
Your welcome sounds different...
and nicer, today.

861
01:18:05,029 --> 01:18:05,654
Good afternoon, sir.

862
01:18:05,864 --> 01:18:07,661
A very good afternoon, Dr. Mathur.

863
01:18:10,702 --> 01:18:13,000
But sir...
-Yes, yes, l know...

864
01:18:13,204 --> 01:18:17,231
l've come a few days in advance.
But l couldn't help it.

865
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:18,431
l've waited so many years...

866
01:18:18,643 --> 01:18:21,271
...but now that we're so close to success...

867
01:18:21,546 --> 01:18:25,676
...being patient is very difficult.

868
01:18:26,217 --> 01:18:29,186
Must say you and yourteam deserve credit...

869
01:18:29,387 --> 01:18:32,185
...for making my dream come true again.

870
01:18:32,891 --> 01:18:35,792
Sir, the credit goes to Rohit Mehra...

871
01:18:36,494 --> 01:18:39,361
lf it wasn't for his notes and research...

872
01:18:39,898 --> 01:18:42,366
...it was impossible to build
that computer again.

873
01:18:43,735 --> 01:18:47,034
Absolute genius!-You're right, sir

874
01:18:47,906 --> 01:18:50,374
The computerthat Rohit made in 2 years...

875
01:18:50,575 --> 01:18:52,702
...has taken us so many years to make.

876
01:18:55,179 --> 01:18:58,046
That's why l still miss him.

877
01:18:59,984 --> 01:19:00,882
Excuse me

878
01:19:19,604 --> 01:19:25,941
People say ''Who has seen the future?''

879
01:19:28,046 --> 01:19:32,949
But in a few days, you and l...

880
01:19:33,785 --> 01:19:38,688
...will change this forever.

881
01:19:40,558 --> 01:19:43,186
Breaking news!

882
01:19:43,428 --> 01:19:46,693
Afteryears of struggle, hard work,
research and patience...

883
01:19:46,864 --> 01:19:52,894
...Dr. Siddhant Arya's most ambitious project
is about to be completed.

884
01:19:53,471 --> 01:19:57,407
According to our correspondent,
in just a few days...

885
01:19:57,609 --> 01:20:01,739
...Dr Arya will be able to predict the future of
individuals, countries and the world!

886
01:20:01,946 --> 01:20:04,005
He'll also be able to change the
course of their destinies.

887
01:20:04,215 --> 01:20:07,651
And the truth is, one who can see
and change the future...

888
01:20:07,852 --> 01:20:10,218
...is considered like God!

889
01:20:12,657 --> 01:20:13,817
Wrong!

890
01:20:15,526 --> 01:20:18,324
Not Like God...

891
01:20:19,097 --> 01:20:22,066
He is God!

892
01:20:23,868 --> 01:20:27,702
l will be God.

893
01:20:28,706 --> 01:20:31,971
Now no one can stop me.

894
01:21:06,878 --> 01:21:09,642
We're already late and then
this is how you park the car?

895
01:21:09,881 --> 01:21:11,781
l can't even open the door!
How am l going to get out?

896
01:21:12,016 --> 01:21:13,950
But neither can l!

897
01:21:14,052 --> 01:21:19,217
Great! Let's just sit in the car
and stare at each other!

898
01:21:19,424 --> 01:21:22,188
You always mess things up!
Krishna's flight must have landed...

899
01:21:22,393 --> 01:21:24,486
...he must be looking for us.

900
01:21:51,022 --> 01:21:52,489
l'm sorry, Sir!

901
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:54,351
You're not hurt, are you?

902
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:16,174
Krishna

903
01:22:23,988 --> 01:22:27,788
Krishna, you're looking
is so good in these clothes.

904
01:22:30,027 --> 01:22:31,153
They are my fathers.

905
01:22:32,497 --> 01:22:36,058
Krishna, welcome to Singapore!

906
01:22:36,467 --> 01:22:39,630
O my god! You look so handsome!

907
01:22:40,671 --> 01:22:42,400
You two have come alone?

908
01:22:42,607 --> 01:22:44,871
How can two people be 'alone'?

909
01:22:45,076 --> 01:22:49,308
No! l mean, hasn't your mother
come with you?

910
01:22:49,514 --> 01:22:50,310
Mother?

911
01:22:50,681 --> 01:22:51,978
ls she also coming here?

912
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:53,476
lt would've been nice if she were here.

913
01:22:53,851 --> 01:22:58,083
l'd have asked foryour hand and
gone back to lndia immediately.

914
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:00,052
Grandma's all alone, you see.

915
01:23:01,225 --> 01:23:02,658
He's in a tearing hurry!

916
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:05,124
Has he brought a priest along to
solemnise the wedding?

917
01:23:05,329 --> 01:23:05,920
Shut up!

918
01:23:06,964 --> 01:23:07,430
What happened?

919
01:23:07,632 --> 01:23:11,363
Well actually, Mom, you know...

920
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:13,264
Her mom's gone.

921
01:23:13,471 --> 01:23:14,495
Yeah she's gone...

922
01:23:14,972 --> 01:23:15,597
Gone?

923
01:23:16,307 --> 01:23:17,797
To Hong Kong

924
01:23:18,009 --> 01:23:18,771
Yes, Hong Kong!

925
01:23:18,976 --> 01:23:19,670
Hong Kong?

926
01:23:20,411 --> 01:23:22,436
She'll be back in 10-15 days

927
01:23:22,647 --> 01:23:23,773
Yes, she'll come.

928
01:23:23,981 --> 01:23:28,145
10-15 days? But what will l do here
for so many days?

929
01:23:28,386 --> 01:23:32,447
Why Krishna? Didn't you take us around
your village when we came there?

930
01:23:32,657 --> 01:23:34,488
Now we'll show you our city.

931
01:23:38,095 --> 01:23:39,323
This is your apartment.

932
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:41,527
This is your living room.

933
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:43,698
This is your bedroom

934
01:23:44,001 --> 01:23:46,026
And these clothes are foryou

935
01:23:46,237 --> 01:23:47,761
This is your cell phone.

936
01:23:48,272 --> 01:23:49,864
lt has all our numbers.

937
01:23:50,241 --> 01:23:52,266
You can call us anytime.

938
01:23:54,745 --> 01:23:58,203
But why can't l live with you
in your house, Priya?

939
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:00,447
Well...

940
01:24:00,818 --> 01:24:03,218
Because mom...
- ...is not around

941
01:24:03,421 --> 01:24:05,685
Yes! Mom's not around
wouldn't be proper

942
01:24:09,861 --> 01:24:10,885
Hey! My phone is ringing!

943
01:24:11,562 --> 01:24:13,393
lt says 'Mama' how do l take the call?

944
01:24:13,831 --> 01:24:16,891
Looks like l gave you my cell phone
by mistake, Excuse me.

945
01:24:17,134 --> 01:24:19,364
Hello Priya, l have good news!

946
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:21,203
l've found a boy foryou.

947
01:24:21,405 --> 01:24:23,839
l'm busy right now.
l'll call you later, Mama.

948
01:24:24,041 --> 01:24:25,565
lt was your mom's call?
Let me say hello to her.

949
01:24:25,776 --> 01:24:27,334
No, it wasn't mom

950
01:24:27,545 --> 01:24:30,036
lt was my uncle.

951
01:24:30,882 --> 01:24:32,110
l could've said hello to him.

952
01:24:32,316 --> 01:24:33,681
Does he live here too?

953
01:24:33,885 --> 01:24:34,579
Yes...

954
01:24:35,319 --> 01:24:37,719
No! He lives in lndia.

955
01:24:37,922 --> 01:24:39,617
l see, where in lndia?

956
01:24:40,057 --> 01:24:42,355
Krishna, we've got to go to office.

957
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,222
We'll give you her uncle's address later.

958
01:24:45,429 --> 01:24:48,159
with pin code. But we've got to leave now. Bye!

959
01:24:49,267 --> 01:24:51,360
Bye!- Bye

960
01:24:52,937 --> 01:24:55,428
How many lies do we have
to speak to cover up one lie?

961
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,040
The excuse of an uncle saved us today!
- Tomorrow it'll be an aunt!

962
01:24:58,242 --> 01:25:00,540
There is no dearth of relatives. Relax!

963
01:25:01,345 --> 01:25:02,903
Did you see his eyes?

964
01:25:03,581 --> 01:25:05,572
They were full of love and trust.

965
01:25:06,317 --> 01:25:07,750
Honey, l can't do this!

966
01:25:07,952 --> 01:25:09,715
l can't hurt Krishna anymore.

967
01:25:09,921 --> 01:25:13,322
Hurt? He's going to become a
celebrity thanks to you.

968
01:25:13,524 --> 01:25:15,219
And we'll get a promotion.

969
01:25:15,426 --> 01:25:19,260
And even if he gets to know,
a small lie is not going to hurt him

970
01:25:21,565 --> 01:25:22,395
What happened?

971
01:25:22,934 --> 01:25:27,462
You? How did you get here from the 20th floor?

972
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:28,296
l took the stairs.

973
01:25:28,506 --> 01:25:29,905
Stairs?

974
01:25:30,107 --> 01:25:36,478
Actually, Priya, l've got something foryou...

975
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:39,674
What?

976
01:25:43,721 --> 01:25:46,053
l'll go get the car ok?

977
01:25:50,895 --> 01:25:52,021
Close your eyes.

978
01:25:54,031 --> 01:25:57,797
Priya, why do you widen your eyes
whenever l ask you to close them?

979
01:26:02,773 --> 01:26:03,637
Open them now

980
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:10,043
May l put it on yourfinger?

981
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:16,479
Give me your hand

982
01:26:26,998 --> 01:26:29,364
Looks nice?

983
01:26:31,002 --> 01:26:31,969
Yes, now it looks nice.

984
01:26:33,504 --> 01:26:35,404
Okay bye.- Bye

Ten days will go by in no time.

Tell me how are you finding it there?

01:30:08,185 --> 01:30:09,618
There are a lot of high rise buildings here.

01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:12,311
And my apartment is on the 20th floor...

1010
01:30:12,523 --> 01:30:15,048
And l'm talking to you from the balcony right now.

01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:18,028
Ok, ok, take care of yourself.

And give my love and blessings to Priya.

Just imagine! That's the
name of our new show.

1014
01:30:25,269 --> 01:30:31,572
Can you imagine a human being
climbing a tree fasterthan a monkey?

1015
01:30:31,775 --> 01:30:35,836
No... isn't it? Well after watching
our show today.

1016
01:30:36,046 --> 01:30:39,538
You won't just imagine,
but also believe that is possible.

1017
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:44,016
Get set then! On one end is the
world famous orangutan Mao...

1018
01:30:44,588 --> 01:30:47,523
....who in a blink, will climb this pole.

1019
01:30:47,725 --> 01:30:50,387
And on the other side is
lndian superboy Krishna!

1020
01:30:51,795 --> 01:30:52,454
What's happening here, Priya?

1021
01:30:52,663 --> 01:30:53,322
What happened?

1022
01:30:53,530 --> 01:30:55,464
You brought me here to watch a shoot!

1023
01:30:55,666 --> 01:30:59,602
True. But then l thought if you can watch a shoot,
you can even perform in it!

1024
01:30:59,803 --> 01:31:02,135
But how can l climb the pole fasterthan Mao?

1025
01:31:02,339 --> 01:31:05,536
Like you climbed the mountain!
The zigzag manner...remember?

1026
01:31:05,743 --> 01:31:07,973
But what if l lose to Mao?

1027
01:31:08,178 --> 01:31:10,009

1028
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:11,238

No! l'll never let that happen.

01:31:19,657 --> 01:31:21,488
So do it please! lt'll be great fun.

1033
01:31:27,998 --> 01:31:28,965

1038
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,005
Krishna...Ready?

1039
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:43,841
Priya, there's just a pole's distance
between us and our success!

1040
01:31:44,048 --> 01:31:45,879
Not a pole, it's just a moment. Stupid!

Boss, it's all about brotherhood

1047
01:32:19,416 --> 01:32:20,576
Shut up!

And l'm tired of you monkeying around

You don't get your act together;

1063
01:33:44,835 --> 01:33:47,565
Strange! Why vent your
anger against Mao, on me?

1064
01:33:47,771 --> 01:33:49,705
How can l help it if he refused
to climb the pole?

1065
01:33:50,007 --> 01:33:53,465
And the fish...instead of
coming into my hand...

1066
01:33:53,677 --> 01:33:55,975
They palmed off a can, a shoe and that...

1067
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,007
Wow! Priya smile!

1068
01:34:06,023 --> 01:34:08,514
ln lndia you caught the fish so easily!

1069
01:34:08,725 --> 01:34:11,319
Actually those fish knew me,
they stood by me.

1070
01:34:11,528 --> 01:34:13,621
But you're not standing by me!

1071
01:34:15,566 --> 01:34:17,932
l've come to stand by you for life, Priya.

1072
01:34:18,702 --> 01:34:21,227
For life? When my mother asks
you what you do?

1073
01:34:21,438 --> 01:34:22,735
What will you say?

1074
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:24,100
l'll tell her what l do

1075
01:34:24,641 --> 01:34:25,608
Love you.

1076
01:34:27,978 --> 01:34:28,967
And...what else will you say?

1077
01:34:29,646 --> 01:34:32,877
l'll fulfill all your wishes, look afteryou.

1078
01:34:33,617 --> 01:34:34,413
And...?

1079
01:34:35,886 --> 01:34:38,218
l'll never let a smile leave yourface.

1080
01:34:44,561 --> 01:34:45,323
And..?

1081
01:34:46,063 --> 01:34:47,928
Whethertimes good or bad
we'll always be together.

1082
01:34:49,099 --> 01:34:50,828
just like eyelashes are with the eyes.

1083
01:34:52,736 --> 01:34:53,532
And...?

1084
01:34:54,171 --> 01:34:57,402
You will dream and l'll fulfill them.

1085
01:34:59,943 --> 01:35:00,705
And...?

1086
01:35:01,044 --> 01:35:03,012
ln the scorching heat of the sun,
l'll be your shade.

1087
01:35:04,081 --> 01:35:05,776
and in the cold, l'll give you warmth.

1088
01:35:06,817 --> 01:35:09,149
When the rains botheryou, l'll change
the course of the clouds.
