1
00:03:27,936 --> 00:03:29,267
Ma'am..

2
00:03:29,637 --> 00:03:31,571
Ma'am.. please buy a book.

3
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:34,771
This is a book of serial.

4
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:36,242
just one book.

5
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:38,006
They are so cheap.

6
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:39,779
Sister, this is cheaper.
- Oh! Get lost.

7
00:03:39,848 --> 00:03:41,577
Sister, this is cheaper.

8
00:03:41,683 --> 00:03:43,583
Sister.. Sister,
fast.. Make it fast.

9
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:45,278
Take one book, sister.

10
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:46,684
Sister, this is for you..

11
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:48,382
Sister, please take one.

12
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,732
O God! Fighting all
the times.. Take this.

13
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:15,435
And switch off the TV.

14
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:19,808
Tanya hurry.. Chirag
Saree shoot at 2:00pm.

15
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:21,280
Hurry up.

16
00:05:22,984 --> 00:05:24,508
I won't do it.

17
00:05:24,586 --> 00:05:26,781
Tanya, I have
already taken an advance.

18
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:28,321
You'll have to go.

19
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:29,820
NO

20
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,953
Tanya..

21
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,334
Okay, sir?
- A little lower.

22
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,337
Some more.

23
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:49,741
lower.

24
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:53,374
A little higher.

25
00:06:15,703 --> 00:06:17,193
Who's doing it?

26
00:06:30,518 --> 00:06:31,780
Bonus points.

27
00:06:35,757 --> 00:06:37,349
Wife. Kids. What do you do?

28
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,286
Coming at you. I am a
crazy lesbian. Yeah!

29
00:06:42,664 --> 00:06:43,790
There.

30
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:46,499
''killed me.''

31
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:49,392
''killed me.''

32
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:06,319
Oh God.

33
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:08,354
Zakir Hussain.

34
00:08:30,738 --> 00:08:32,228
it is serious.

35
00:08:32,406 --> 00:08:33,737
Had it not been serious..

36
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:36,335
..I wouldn't have come
here to talk to you both.

37
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:38,838
I can understand she
is in a state of shock..

38
00:08:38,913 --> 00:08:40,778
..because of her mother's death.

39
00:08:40,882 --> 00:08:43,316
she writes her mother's name..

40
00:08:43,384 --> 00:08:47,480
..on all her assignments, on
every page, report and book.

41
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:50,724
She is scribbling her
mother's name all over the school.

42
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,385
She has claustrophobia issues.

43
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:56,256
What are you trying to say, ma'am?

44
00:08:56,397 --> 00:08:58,297
Please don't get me wrong..

45
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:02,163
..but I seriously feel your
daughter needs clinical treatment.

46
00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:04,928
Mr. Jaishankar, I'm
really sorry to say..

47
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:07,835
..but these are signs
of mental disturbance.

48
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,467
No, please. Just stop here.

49
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:11,611
We know she's been through trauma.

50
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:13,737
She has already had
enough counselling, ma'am.

51
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:18,852
I don't intend to
hurt your feelings.

52
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,685
I'm just trying to do my job.

53
00:09:20,755 --> 00:09:22,689
Then please,
ma'am, just do it right.

54
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:24,390
You can't come here, to
my house and tell me..

55
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,550
..that my daughter is going mad.

56
00:09:25,593 --> 00:09:28,187
You are being absolutely unfair.
I have said no such thing.

57
00:09:28,262 --> 00:09:29,456
Please.

58
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:32,257
I have prepared a cheque for
donation. Tara, just give it to her.

59
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,458
I'll be in my study, okay?

60
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:35,798
Jai..
- I tell you..

61
00:09:37,872 --> 00:09:40,500
Please. I.. I'm really sorry.

62
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:42,236
I got you.

63
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,641
What's wrong with you, Amu?

64
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:50,408
I am shifting all my
business to Bombay.

65
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:53,387
So many issues to seal with and

66
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:54,985
On top of that you..

67
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:57,224
Why can't you stop embarrassing us?

68
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,656
Make life a little easier for us.

69
00:09:58,726 --> 00:10:00,717
It's not Bombay, dad. It's Mumbai.

70
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:03,555
What?
- Do you know why it's Mumbai?

71
00:10:04,232 --> 00:10:06,359
Because of the Goddess Mumbadevi.

72
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:08,896
Did you see her photo?

73
00:10:09,737 --> 00:10:11,227
She is beautiful.

74
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:13,796
Amu, your dad is trying to
tell you something, darling.

75
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,810
He is, right? Just
stop interrupting him.

76
00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:20,440
Amu, talk to your mother properly.

77
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:22,641
I always talk
properly with my mother.

78
00:10:22,717 --> 00:10:23,877
Amu.

79
00:10:24,318 --> 00:10:25,683
Just forget it.

80
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,514
And you, young lady,
you better get going.

81
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:30,022
Have you decided what you will wear?

82
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,485
Charu.

83
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:32,956
Hurry up, Charu.

84
00:10:34,395 --> 00:10:35,953
Which one? This one or that one?

85
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,794
No.

86
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:42,634
No, I'm not wearing that.

87
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:44,563
No way.

88
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,552
Hello, Mr. Chopra. That too early!

89
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,987
That's great. That's great.
Meet my wife, Nikki.

90
00:11:03,257 --> 00:11:05,452
Look, how scantily dressed she is.

91
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:08,984
Hello, Mr. Chopra.
Whats up with your paunch?

92
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,222
Did you eat your children?

93
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,497
Yes, they weren't doing
their homework. Hence I..

94
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:18,504
Oh, hi. I'm a model from abroad.

95
00:11:18,572 --> 00:11:21,473
I just got imported from Germany.

96
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,772
I love Lord Ganesha.

97
00:11:27,415 --> 00:11:28,780
Hello, I'm KC.

98
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,675
Amy.

99
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:43,293
Hi.

100
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:46,291
I've seen you somewhere.

101
00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:51,361
Didn't like the pickup line?

102
00:11:54,342 --> 00:11:55,775
Do you want to
start a joint account?

103
00:11:58,012 --> 00:11:59,502
I don't smoke.

104
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:03,978
No, really. I don't smoke.

105
00:12:07,588 --> 00:12:10,785
As I child I wanted
to be a gynaecologist.

106
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:14,453
But nowadays I am
considering an MBA.

107
00:12:14,795 --> 00:12:17,320
In the meanwhile I'm
squandering my father's money.

108
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:22,425
That's my daddy dearest.

109
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,504
Mr. Rajeshwari Chaudhary.

110
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:25,732
Hail Goddess.

111
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:30,741
And that's my dad.
Mr. Anand Jaishankar.

112
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:33,905
Wiping his hand
discreetly after every handshake.

113
00:12:34,582 --> 00:12:35,879
He's so OCD.

114
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,242
You mean OCDK.

115
00:12:38,486 --> 00:12:39,646
What?

116
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:43,518
Anyway, he's a bit fake,
but I love him.

117
00:12:44,258 --> 00:12:45,885
Is that your mom?

118
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,355
No, that's my step mom.

119
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,389
They have been
together since 3 years.

120
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,264
Poor thing.

121
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:56,302
It's not her fault.
She was born ugly.

122
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,438
She is not that bad.

123
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:02,974
My mom's prettier.

124
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:05,643
I'm sure she is.

125
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:12,917
'It's been 12 years
since I met my mom.'

126
00:13:13,521 --> 00:13:15,921
'They keep her
locked up in a tiny room.'

127
00:13:16,624 --> 00:13:18,285
'I miss her so much.'

128
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:23,490
'My sister is the only one I
get along with, in my family.'

129
00:13:23,798 --> 00:13:26,631
'She's been in a
wheelchair since childhood.'

130
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,369
'You know, my mom
has a beautiful smile.'

131
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:32,731
'She looks just like me.'

132
00:13:33,507 --> 00:13:35,668
'Actually, I look just like her.'

133
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:38,639
'You don't like Mumbai?'

134
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,907
'I like LA more.'

135
00:13:42,883 --> 00:13:44,874
'There's a Holi party
at my place, day after

136
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:47,653
'Let's make Mumbai
colourful for you.'

137
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:50,323
'We just met. Let
me think about it.'

138
00:13:50,391 --> 00:13:51,483
'You'll come. I know you will come.'

139
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:02,697
What's going on?

140
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:05,632
Rajesh?

141
00:14:14,348 --> 00:14:17,340
Hollywood. 10:00am. My place.
'Holi' party.

142
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:19,418
See you there.

143
00:15:01,262 --> 00:15:03,253
Want to play?
- No thanks.

144
00:15:04,298 --> 00:15:05,458
Watch and learn.

145
00:15:09,703 --> 00:15:10,863
Oh, shit.

146
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:14,340
Happy 'Holi'.

147
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:16,569
Enjoy. Enjoy.

148
00:15:19,213 --> 00:15:21,545
New in town? Bored as hell.

149
00:15:21,615 --> 00:15:23,776
Looking for some Indian spice.

150
00:15:24,485 --> 00:15:26,350
Do you have a boyfriend?
- No.

151
00:15:26,854 --> 00:15:28,344
Can I try?

152
00:15:28,722 --> 00:15:30,781
Where's KC?
- KC?

153
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:34,451
Why KC when you have Parsee?

154
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:35,855
What?

155
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,761
Seriously, we are a dying breed.

156
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:39,594
Screw the tigers save the Parsees.

157
00:15:40,768 --> 00:15:41,962
I can be KC.

158
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:43,926
KC 2.0.

159
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:46,703
Seriously.
- Seriously.

160
00:15:47,308 --> 00:15:48,900
Where is KC?
- Like, where's KC?

161
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:55,541
The fish..

162
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:56,943
Okay.

163
00:15:57,284 --> 00:15:59,479
Does it take this long to get beer?

164
00:15:59,553 --> 00:16:01,487
It's recycled. Will it do?

165
00:16:03,324 --> 00:16:05,224
Amrita Jaishankar. Tanya.

166
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:06,782
Tanya. Amrita Jaishankar.

167
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,418
You can also call her Amy.

168
00:16:08,796 --> 00:16:10,787
quiz her if you like.

169
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:12,731
I need to get myself a drink.
- Hi.

170
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:16,496
So, Hollywood.

171
00:16:17,304 --> 00:16:18,703
How many guys have you slept with?

172
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,204
Do you eat crows?

173
00:16:20,674 --> 00:16:22,574
Is the word 'brother' a
relationship or an abuse.

174
00:16:22,977 --> 00:16:25,571
What do you think? We like you?

175
00:16:26,614 --> 00:16:28,605
Is the word 'brother' a
relationship or an abuse.

176
00:16:28,816 --> 00:16:29,976
Where does one apply
Himani Navratna oil?

177
00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:31,741
Okay. Enough. Enough.

178
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:39,652
You know, Hollywood..

179
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:43,291
..friends are of two kinds.

180
00:16:44,598 --> 00:16:48,534
Some you can call at 2:00am.

181
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:50,861
And you know that they
will be there for you.

182
00:16:51,672 --> 00:16:56,575
And then the ones whom
you ONLY call at 2:00am.

183
00:16:59,346 --> 00:17:01,405
You must have read the
forwarded emails right?

184
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:05,313
So, you know that there are
seven rules of friendship.

185
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,411
We have one more rule.

186
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:10,588
Screw all the rules, no rules.

187
00:17:12,393 --> 00:17:15,362
Yes, there is one thing.

188
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:18,924
There is one thing.

189
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:22,266
Just one rule. Trust.

190
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:44,290
Trust.

191
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:47,292
Trust.

192
00:17:47,928 --> 00:17:52,365
You know, Hollywood,
trust is like balls. Balls.

193
00:17:53,434 --> 00:17:55,527
It doesn't really
matter if you have them.

194
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:57,430
But if you don't have them..

195
00:17:59,506 --> 00:18:00,734
..you can't play.

196
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:04,439
I don't promise that
we will be there..

197
00:18:04,511 --> 00:18:06,274
..to help you solve
all your problems.

198
00:18:06,347 --> 00:18:08,372
Because that's not going to happen.

199
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:14,854
But as long as you are with us,
you will not have any problems.

200
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,491
And that is a promise.

201
00:18:20,227 --> 00:18:22,388
Do you know how to swim?
- Yes.

202
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:29,667
'After KC's long
boring speech, I realised..'

203
00:18:29,737 --> 00:18:32,535
'..why people are so
violent during riots?'

204
00:18:35,876 --> 00:18:40,609
'Because being a part of something
makes you feel so powerful.'

205
00:18:41,415 --> 00:18:45,647
'Earlier, I used to
feel that life is a wait.'

206
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:48,244
'A long boring wait.'

207
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:53,717
'Now I feel life is like a movie.'

208
00:18:53,894 --> 00:18:57,591
'So what if it's boring.
You can at least forward it.'

209
00:20:01,662 --> 00:20:03,220
Do you have a girlfriend?

210
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:05,421
She's dead.

211
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:07,366
Did you kill her?

212
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:16,571
No.

213
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:19,405
No!

214
00:20:24,685 --> 00:20:25,879
Zubin.

215
00:20:27,955 --> 00:20:29,445
Oh, shit.

216
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:41,425
Perfect.

217
00:20:41,468 --> 00:20:42,594
Yes.

218
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:06,485
Is it love?

219
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,259
With KC?

220
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,727
Come on, man. She's sweet.

221
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:13,963
She's very down-market.

222
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:18,265
You are so cute when you lie.

223
00:21:19,673 --> 00:21:20,901
Are you hitting on me?

224
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,601
What do you see in him anyway?

225
00:21:55,676 --> 00:21:57,303
I see myself in him.

226
00:21:57,711 --> 00:22:00,680
Then you don't need KC.
you need a mirror.

227
00:22:51,932 --> 00:22:53,331
Arvind! Are you crazy?

228
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,765
You are out on bail.

229
00:22:55,469 --> 00:22:57,733
We won't gain anything
by doing something here.

230
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:01,803
Let's go to the
commissioner's office tomorrow.

231
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:03,970
Where are you going? Wait.

232
00:23:04,745 --> 00:23:06,542
Arvind! Arvind!

233
00:23:19,526 --> 00:23:21,357
Where is sir?
- Sir is upstairs.

234
00:23:28,435 --> 00:23:29,834
Enjoy the party, buddy.

235
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:31,497
Please go. Don't bother me.

236
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:34,005
Have some more.
- Enough. Enough. I'm already full.

237
00:23:34,274 --> 00:23:38,472
Sir, if you say 'yes' the work
on building will start soon.

238
00:23:41,415 --> 00:23:42,643
Mr. Mathur.

239
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:44,845
back with a warrant?

240
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,485
Oh brother!

241
00:23:52,492 --> 00:23:54,357
Hey, someone go
downstairs and check him.

242
00:23:54,428 --> 00:23:56,487
Hey, what happened?
You pushed him down?

243
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:12,245
Next time if you raise
your hand on any woman

244
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:14,242
..then I will throw you from the
tenth floor and not the first.

245
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,719
He will never trouble you again.

246
00:26:06,193 --> 00:26:09,356
What, man. You guys bicker a lot.

247
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:10,726
So much noise!

248
00:26:10,931 --> 00:26:14,196
One shouldn't rent out
to young couples like you.

249
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:19,468
I didn't sleep the whole night.
Not even for a minute.

250
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,339
So many bags?

251
00:26:25,412 --> 00:26:27,505
You are going to your mother's?

252
00:26:55,775 --> 00:26:57,242
Devil.

253
00:26:58,745 --> 00:27:00,269
Fairy.

254
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,545
Amy, you will blink now.

255
00:00:27,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Www.mOVIEshareZ.coM

256
00:27:02,849 --> 00:27:04,282
Yeah?

257
00:27:08,421 --> 00:27:09,786
It must hurt.

258
00:27:15,896 --> 00:27:21,459
I am the devil, my
eyes are always wide open!

259
00:27:21,735 --> 00:27:23,396
No, that's not going to work, Amy.

260
00:27:23,904 --> 00:27:27,863
Because I have focus and you don't.

261
00:27:29,242 --> 00:27:31,870
I have another thing
which you don't have.

262
00:27:31,945 --> 00:27:33,344
What?

263
00:27:39,586 --> 00:27:41,850
Nice try, but no.

264
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,383
I would have won.

265
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:46,755
I think we both
know who would've won.

266
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:51,354
Put your knockers away..
help me clean up this mess

267
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,267
Your mommies such a hottie.

268
00:27:58,471 --> 00:28:00,939
not ugly like your mom.

269
00:28:03,944 --> 00:28:05,502
Touchy, Parsee.

270
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:09,441
What's going on here?

271
00:28:10,317 --> 00:28:12,615
Eye lock.
- Eye lock. I want to play.

272
00:28:12,686 --> 00:28:14,415
I also want to play. I also
want to play. Play with me.

273
00:28:14,454 --> 00:28:15,580
What do I need to do?

274
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:18,414
Eye lock.

275
00:28:37,644 --> 00:28:39,805
No. No. No.

276
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:44,748
KC, I am starving. Let's go out.

277
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:48,512
I am not going out.
- Oh c'mon let's go out.

278
00:28:49,356 --> 00:28:50,880
Son, cook something, will you?

279
00:28:50,991 --> 00:28:53,619
Stuff your son up. I
am not Sanjeev Kapoor.

280
00:28:54,694 --> 00:28:56,491
Order and pay for it.

281
00:28:57,263 --> 00:28:58,457
Move.

282
00:28:58,932 --> 00:29:00,900
KC. Come on, let's go out.

283
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:02,766
Anything for you, Hollywood.

284
00:29:03,636 --> 00:29:05,228
Let's have a midnight buffet.

285
00:29:07,674 --> 00:29:09,767
There's no romance
in a midnight buffet.

286
00:29:10,543 --> 00:29:13,273
Romance lies in
scrambled eggs and bun.

287
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,806
Scrambled eggs and bun.

288
00:29:28,428 --> 00:29:31,397
Parsee, let's have
some drinks now. What say?

289
00:29:31,464 --> 00:29:34,297
Dad's bar is closed.
- Oh.

290
00:29:34,968 --> 00:29:37,493
So what will we do now?

291
00:29:44,844 --> 00:29:48,280
What flavours do
you have in condoms?

292
00:29:48,348 --> 00:29:50,441
Condoms. - Do you have strawberry?
I want strawberry.

293
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,881
Strawberry.
- I don't have strawberry.

294
00:29:52,952 --> 00:29:54,613
You don't? Apricot?
- You have apricot?

295
00:29:54,687 --> 00:29:56,416
I don't have apricot.
- You don't?

296
00:29:56,489 --> 00:29:58,252
Then what do you have?
- Not a problem.

297
00:29:58,324 --> 00:29:59,552
And..

298
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:00,786
Amy, will litchee do?

299
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,350
It will be great. It will be great.

300
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:03,862
I don't have litchee.
- 'Kala Khatta' (java plum)?

301
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,363
'Kala Khatta'?

302
00:30:05,432 --> 00:30:11,496
Do one thing. 2 litchees.
2 chocolates. And..

303
00:30:11,738 --> 00:30:14,673
4 strawberries. Parcel it.

304
00:30:27,353 --> 00:30:30,015
Wait. Wait. Wait.
- Run. Run. Run.

305
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,757
Wait. Wait. Wait.

306
00:30:33,927 --> 00:30:35,986
What difference does it make if the
cough syrup is for kids or adults?

307
00:30:36,262 --> 00:30:37,388
You wasted time unnecessarily.

308
00:30:37,464 --> 00:30:40,331
Expiry date. Eh E E E
E E E E SExpiry date.

309
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:44,266
I was checking the expiry date.

310
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:49,738
''My heart is beating.
Keeps on repeating.''

311
00:30:50,343 --> 00:30:54,746
''My heart is beating.
Keeps on repeating.''

312
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:58,643
''My heart is beating. Keeps on..''
- Sing the next line dude . .

313
00:30:58,952 --> 00:31:03,480
''I don't know what the lyrics are.''

314
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:07,722
''I'm waiting for you.''

315
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:14,462
''My heart is beating.
Keeps on repeating.''

316
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:17,430
''He's waiting for me.''

317
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,766
Oh, so sweet.

318
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:24,508
Tanya, what do you
call a crazy vibrator?

319
00:31:24,711 --> 00:31:25,837
What?

320
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:29,915
''Dildo is crazy. Dildo is insane.''

321
00:31:30,483 --> 00:31:32,678
''Dildo is crazy.''
- ''Dildo is crazy.''

322
00:31:32,752 --> 00:31:34,982
''Dildo is insane.''
- ''Dildo is insane.''

323
00:31:35,255 --> 00:31:38,520
''Dildo is crazy. Dildo is insane.''

324
00:31:38,858 --> 00:31:40,325
ZUbi! Zubi! Zubi! Zubi!

325
00:31:40,393 --> 00:31:41,883
Go. Go. Go. Go for it.

326
00:31:41,961 --> 00:31:44,691
Go slow. Go slow, please.
- Game on, brother.

327
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:49,426
KC, hold this. KC, hold this.
- Slow down. Slow down.

328
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,271
Fuck you.

329
00:31:59,512 --> 00:32:00,843
Fuck you.

330
00:32:08,721 --> 00:32:10,712
Go. Go. Go.

331
00:32:43,623 --> 00:32:45,318
Fuck you!

332
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:53,680
KC, get a cab and go home.

333
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:57,714
Get a cab and go home.

334
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:00,824
I'll drop them and keep the car
in the restaurant for the night.

335
00:35:02,328 --> 00:35:04,387
We will take the car to
Tarun's in the morning.

336
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:06,592
let it be there for some days.

337
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:10,933
We could have saved them.
- Did anyone see us?

338
00:35:11,204 --> 00:35:12,466
There was no one there.

339
00:35:15,274 --> 00:35:17,299
We could have saved them.

340
00:35:18,711 --> 00:35:20,474
It's okay. It's okay.

341
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:16,525
Get me its address.

342
00:37:17,597 --> 00:37:18,757
Okay, tell me.

343
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:21,693
063..

344
00:38:52,825 --> 00:38:53,951
Look, boss.

345
00:38:54,226 --> 00:38:56,990
Here the Courts are no different
From local vegetable markets

346
00:38:57,229 --> 00:38:59,390
Everything is on sale here.

347
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:03,393
If you don't buy it at the
right time, your case will also..

348
00:39:07,273 --> 00:39:09,241
..will rot like stale cauliflowers.

349
00:39:09,508 --> 00:39:11,442
He is Judge Sinha's
close associate.

350
00:39:11,544 --> 00:39:12,704
He will suppress the case.

351
00:39:12,778 --> 00:39:16,544
And if that happens then
you can have your job back.

352
00:39:16,682 --> 00:39:17,842
Ok?

353
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:19,543
Come.

354
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:21,680
Do you have cash?

355
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:25,549
Come.

356
00:39:26,192 --> 00:39:27,659
I'll do the talking inside.

357
00:39:27,727 --> 00:39:29,354
Hello. Okay?

358
00:39:31,263 --> 00:39:33,561
Yes. Yes. No, sir, I remember.
- Come in.

359
00:39:33,633 --> 00:39:34,930
Well..
- Sir.

360
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:38,227
You will get 23 carriages
in two hours, sir. Yes. Yes.

361
00:39:38,304 --> 00:39:39,464
Yes, sir.

362
00:39:39,538 --> 00:39:42,302
And.. The wedding decorator?
- Yes, sir. I have spoken to him.

363
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:44,707
Don't worry, sir. Okay, sir.

364
00:39:45,211 --> 00:39:46,803
Okay, sir. I'll
come in the afternoon.

365
00:39:48,648 --> 00:39:50,616
Okay, sir. Thank you, sir.

366
00:39:57,623 --> 00:39:59,818
Has he got it?
- Yes, he has.

367
00:40:00,693 --> 00:40:02,456
Take it out. Take it out. Hello.

368
00:40:07,466 --> 00:40:09,866
It's Rs.50,000, Mr. Yadav.

369
00:40:10,469 --> 00:40:12,630
That.. Mathur case..

370
00:40:13,305 --> 00:40:16,297
The Corporators case? The one he
flung from the first floor, right?

371
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,366
Yes, that's the one.
That's the one. Yes.

372
00:40:21,847 --> 00:40:24,372
Good. Very good.

373
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:30,816
Be it a cop or a peon,
everyone come to me ultimately.

374
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,618
To get their job done.

375
00:40:34,994 --> 00:40:36,928
Dilbar.
- Coming, sir. I'm here, sir.

376
00:40:36,996 --> 00:40:39,658
Hurry up.
- Hello, sir.

377
00:40:39,732 --> 00:40:42,599
What is this Ballu? Same old stuff?

378
00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:44,893
Dilbar.
- Yes?

379
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:47,336
You brought her last
week as well, right?

380
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:48,634
Are the girls on strike?

381
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:50,869
No, sir. All the girls are on duty.

382
00:40:50,943 --> 00:40:53,377
Mr. Yadav, please manage just once.

383
00:40:53,446 --> 00:40:55,038
I'll make better
arrangements next time.

384
00:40:55,314 --> 00:40:56,406
Okay. Okay. Fine.

385
00:40:56,482 --> 00:40:57,710
Ballu.
- Yes.

386
00:40:57,783 --> 00:40:59,876
Kapari was here in the afternoon.
- Okay.

387
00:40:59,952 --> 00:41:01,783
He was saying you..

388
00:41:03,522 --> 00:41:04,614
You..

389
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,214
Why are you hitting me?

390
00:41:06,525 --> 00:41:08,254
What are you doing?

391
00:41:13,466 --> 00:41:16,765
Help me. - Do you want
me dead? Are you crazy?

392
00:41:16,836 --> 00:41:19,669
You won't be spared.
You.. You are done for.

393
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:21,434
Why are you hitting him?

394
00:41:49,702 --> 00:41:50,930
Sorry I'm late.

395
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,831
Traffic is crazy.

396
00:41:55,608 --> 00:41:56,802
There.

397
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:04,843
Sorry.

398
00:42:10,623 --> 00:42:11,851
What did I miss?

399
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:14,987
Why?

400
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:17,987
What are you trying to
prove by doing all this?

401
00:42:22,968 --> 00:42:24,959
What does she want to prove
by wearing Saira's clothes..

402
00:42:25,004 --> 00:42:26,767
..and make-up and
doing all this? Tell me.

403
00:42:26,939 --> 00:42:28,736
At least somebody remembers mom.

404
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:39,678
Just leave. Leave now.

405
00:42:43,823 --> 00:42:45,916
Amy..
- Just leave me alone.

406
00:42:45,991 --> 00:42:47,481
Please.

407
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:50,756
Please.

408
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:05,374
Yes, Zubin. What happened?
- Somethings happened.

409
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,749
No, I can't come right now .
- Its serious ,just come

410
00:43:12,852 --> 00:43:14,649
Fine. Where?

411
00:43:17,756 --> 00:43:21,522
Why are we meeting here?
- You see the stairs? Come upstairs.

412
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:22,924
Okay, I'm coming up.

413
00:43:23,495 --> 00:43:25,622
Yes, I'm coming up
the stairs right now.

414
00:43:25,931 --> 00:43:27,421
Yes.

415
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,408
Why have you called me here?
- Just come.

416
00:43:36,442 --> 00:43:37,602
What's going on?

417
00:43:39,612 --> 00:43:41,307
It won't take me even two
minutes to arrest all of you.

418
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,608
You know that, don't you?

419
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:45,542
Who is she?

420
00:43:45,618 --> 00:43:47,643
Is she that junkie's sister?
- Sir, she..

421
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,017
Who the hell is this idiot?
- Amy, please..

422
00:43:49,288 --> 00:43:51,256
What did she say?
- Amy, he's a cop. He knows..

423
00:43:51,323 --> 00:43:52,756
What did she say?
- What does he know?

424
00:43:52,825 --> 00:43:55,350
What is your name?
What is your name?

425
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:56,860
Amy.
- Amy what?

426
00:43:56,896 --> 00:43:59,387
Amrita Jaishankar.
- Amrita Jaishankar.

427
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:00,792
Shut your face.
- Amy. Amy, please.

428
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:01,891
You guys..
- Keep quiet.

429
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:03,491
Keep quiet, Amy. Please.

430
00:44:03,569 --> 00:44:04,763
Keep quiet.
- What?

431
00:44:04,837 --> 00:44:06,600
Just because he is a cop
I should touch his feet?

432
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:07,901
Amy
- Keep quiet, please.

433
00:44:07,973 --> 00:44:09,702
He's playing with us. - No.
Sir. Sir. No, sir. Please, wait,

434
00:44:09,775 --> 00:44:11,367
Don't you see he's playing games
with us? - Please sit down, sir.

435
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:12,637
What do you want?
- Amy, just keep quiet.

436
00:44:12,711 --> 00:44:14,269
What do you want? Tell me.
- Amy, please..

437
00:44:14,346 --> 00:44:16,541
Shut up, Amy. Shut up.

438
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:21,979
Who is she? Who is she?
- Sir. Sir, you please..

439
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:23,380
Who is she?
- Sorry, sir.

440
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:24,945
Have a seat, sir. Let's talk, sir.

441
00:44:25,758 --> 00:44:27,248
What are you staring at?
- Sir, you..

442
00:44:27,326 --> 00:44:29,590
Sir. Sir. Sir. Forget her,
sir. We are talking to you, sir.

443
00:44:29,662 --> 00:44:32,358
Have a seat. Please
have a seat. Have a seat.

444
00:44:32,431 --> 00:44:33,989
Amy, please, just
shut up, okay? Please.

445
00:44:34,266 --> 00:44:35,426
Please keep quiet.

446
00:44:37,736 --> 00:44:40,330
You told me that you want to
settle this. That's why I am here.

447
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,535
Otherwise, I would be thrashing
all of you in prison, right now.

448
00:44:43,776 --> 00:44:45,266
Sir, you tell me
what needs to be done.

449
00:44:45,344 --> 00:44:47,710
What.. what will you do?
- Compromise.

450
00:44:56,889 --> 00:44:58,356
25 lakhs.

451
00:44:59,692 --> 00:45:00,989
I'll take 25 lakhs.

452
00:45:02,328 --> 00:45:04,353
Sir, from where will
we arrange for 25 lakhs?

453
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:07,297
Bastard. You want me to
tell you where to get it from?

454
00:45:07,366 --> 00:45:08,765
I'll tell you from
where you will get it?

455
00:45:11,203 --> 00:45:12,932
You have killed two people.
You know that, don't you?

456
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:19,576
You'll get the money from where
you get the booze and these sluts.

457
00:45:19,745 --> 00:45:21,440
I could have gone to your parents.

458
00:45:21,613 --> 00:45:23,444
But I am here
because you asked me to.

459
00:45:23,615 --> 00:45:25,242
You know that. You
know that, don't you?

460
00:45:26,485 --> 00:45:27,884
You will get your money.

461
00:45:29,922 --> 00:45:32,550
Smartass, you have two days.

462
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:35,288
I can't hush the witness
for more than two days.

463
00:45:35,561 --> 00:45:36,755
Got it?

464
00:45:37,997 --> 00:45:41,262
If I get my money, all
of us will be happy.

465
00:45:42,568 --> 00:45:43,967
Otherwise, I am sure
to get a promotion.

466
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:45,731
Get that.

467
00:45:46,605 --> 00:45:50,803
And if you try to run
away then you know..

468
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,640
Two days.

469
00:46:40,325 --> 00:46:41,451
Look..

470
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,919
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

471
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:46,422
I guess cocaine is
still in your system.

472
00:46:47,332 --> 00:46:49,994
The cop wants 25 lakhs,
not 25 thousand.

473
00:46:51,236 --> 00:46:52,726
I always wanted to rob a bank.

474
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:54,701
Everything is
happening because of you.

475
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,501
All these bloody school
boys wanted to impress you.

476
00:46:57,943 --> 00:46:59,240
We have become murderers now.

477
00:46:59,311 --> 00:47:00,608
Stop calling this a
bloody murder, okay?

478
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:02,203
It was an accident.

479
00:47:02,481 --> 00:47:03,607
You were also with us.

480
00:47:03,682 --> 00:47:05,445
Yes, but you were the
one driving the car, KC.

481
00:47:05,517 --> 00:47:06,643
Tanya.

482
00:47:12,324 --> 00:47:14,519
If we have 25 lakhs
then it's an accident.

483
00:47:14,893 --> 00:47:16,258
Otherwise, it's a murder.

484
00:47:16,328 --> 00:47:17,955
Your father is not
a sheikh in Dubai.

485
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:19,958
He's a sheikh's driver.

486
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:21,861
From where will you get the money?

487
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:27,734
From where will we get the money?

488
00:47:37,249 --> 00:47:39,240
A dead elephant is still valuable

489
00:47:40,752 --> 00:47:42,515
Our elephant is still alive.

490
00:47:43,489 --> 00:47:45,389
Elephant.

491
00:47:47,693 --> 00:47:49,251
The one that you drive.

492
00:47:51,463 --> 00:47:53,624
What are you saying, Dash?
Why don't you talk straight?

493
00:47:55,634 --> 00:47:56,862
Tokyo Sam's.

494
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:02,838
'We'll sell your car.'

495
00:48:03,909 --> 00:48:05,843
'We'll get 25 lakhs.'

496
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:07,471
Boom.

497
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,506
Boom.

498
00:48:09,715 --> 00:48:11,740
And we can say that
the car was stolen.

499
00:48:13,185 --> 00:48:15,278
Great and KC's dad
will lodge a complaint.

500
00:48:15,387 --> 00:48:17,514
and thanks to your
hummer's hi-tech GPS system..

501
00:48:17,589 --> 00:48:19,955
..we will be behind bars. Game over.

502
00:48:20,826 --> 00:48:22,623
And what will I tell my dad?

503
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:24,457
The car got lost
while I was driving it?

504
00:48:24,563 --> 00:48:26,258
It's a car, not a mobile phone.

505
00:48:27,232 --> 00:48:29,962
Guys, let's steal
his mother's jewellery.

506
00:48:30,736 --> 00:48:32,499
Been there and done that.

507
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:34,271
You remember what
happened last time?

508
00:48:34,339 --> 00:48:35,829
You stole from your employees?

509
00:48:35,908 --> 00:48:37,705
Tell me. Tell me.
- We are innocent, sir.

510
00:48:37,776 --> 00:48:39,676
Tell me, where have
you hidden the stash?

511
00:48:39,745 --> 00:48:41,337
We didn't steal anything, sir.
- I don't know, sir.

512
00:48:41,413 --> 00:48:42,675
Tell me the truth.
- I don't know, sir.

513
00:48:42,748 --> 00:48:44,739
Where have you hidden the stash?
- Sir, I don't know anything.

514
00:48:44,816 --> 00:48:48,684
I am innocent, sir.
- We are innocent, sir.

515
00:48:49,755 --> 00:48:50,983
OK. Wait wait wait.

516
00:48:51,256 --> 00:48:52,621
Wait a minute.. you
want to sell my car.

517
00:48:52,858 --> 00:48:54,689
Steal my mother's jewellery.

518
00:48:54,826 --> 00:48:56,851
Am I the only money
bags in this city?

519
00:48:56,995 --> 00:48:58,963
you always carry so much money

520
00:48:59,464 --> 00:49:02,831
Of course, you are the only
rich guy who has committed murder.

521
00:49:03,602 --> 00:49:05,502
I mean accident.

522
00:49:05,704 --> 00:49:08,764
Guys, why don't we just go
and talk to our parents?

523
00:49:09,174 --> 00:49:11,506
Yes. - They are our parents.
They will understand.

524
00:49:11,577 --> 00:49:12,805
Are you kidding?

525
00:49:12,878 --> 00:49:14,937
My dad is on a project
commissioned by the government.

526
00:49:15,447 --> 00:49:17,472
Everything will be over
if such a news gets out.

527
00:49:17,549 --> 00:49:20,484
And you know my father.
He's a saint.

528
00:49:21,186 --> 00:49:24,280
He will disown me.

529
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:30,693
What about the marbles.
Balls. Trust.

530
00:49:30,963 --> 00:49:33,659
The things KC always
keeps barking about.

531
00:49:33,966 --> 00:49:35,661
Really?
- That's just his.. - Barking?

532
00:49:35,701 --> 00:49:37,896
Barking?
- Shomu. Shomu.

533
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:39,597
Oh, yes. We have to stick together.
- Shomu.

534
00:49:39,638 --> 00:49:41,401
That's what we are doing.
We are sticking together.

535
00:49:41,473 --> 00:49:42,963
Shomu.

536
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:46,841
'My friend, Shomu.'

537
00:49:48,614 --> 00:49:49,842
Hi. Shomu.

538
00:49:50,916 --> 00:49:54,249
'Shomu was sitting on the dinner
table and glaring at his mother.'

539
00:49:56,355 --> 00:49:58,823
'But why was he doing that?'

540
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:01,384
Flashback.

541
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,223
'Shomu, this is
already a flashback.'

542
00:50:03,996 --> 00:50:05,793
Then it's a
flashback in a flashback.

543
00:50:07,432 --> 00:50:09,525
'Once, Shomu was in deep slumber.'

544
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:13,867
'His mother found uncut cocaine
worth 10 lakhs in his bag.'

545
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:18,969
'His mother very affectionately
flushed the cocaine.'

546
00:50:19,244 --> 00:50:21,678
'And gave Shomu a tight slap.'

547
00:50:22,281 --> 00:50:24,681
'While munching on
the dinner table..'

548
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:28,481
'..Shomu greedy gaze/shifted/towards
his small, chubby brother..'

549
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,286
'..who was sitting on his
father's lap and gobbling sweets.'

550
00:50:32,357 --> 00:50:33,881
'Then an idea flashed

551
00:50:34,359 --> 00:50:36,919
'Step One. mix pills
into chocolate mousse.'

552
00:50:40,699 --> 00:50:45,033
'Step Two. hidechubby
Monu under his own bed.'

553
00:50:46,872 --> 00:50:49,932
Call them now. - 'Step Three.
He called his friend.'

554
00:50:50,909 --> 00:50:52,342
Okay.

555
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:57,445
'Step Four. Shomu's friend
calls up Shomu's father.'

556
00:51:00,752 --> 00:51:02,686
'And demands a ransom of 20 lakhs.'

557
00:51:02,788 --> 00:51:03,914
What?

558
00:51:05,257 --> 00:51:09,660
'Step five. Shomu stops his
father from calling the cops.'

559
00:51:09,728 --> 00:51:11,958
'He diverts his
attention towards his mother.'

560
00:51:12,331 --> 00:51:13,525
Monu.

561
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:16,931
Mama, ask papa to save Monu.

562
00:51:17,502 --> 00:51:18,992
Papa, please save Monu. Papa.

563
00:51:19,271 --> 00:51:21,364
'Then some television
serial acting.'

564
00:51:22,007 --> 00:51:24,771
Papa, please, papa. Save him.

565
00:51:24,843 --> 00:51:26,470
My Monu.

566
00:51:27,846 --> 00:51:29,711
'And your dish is ready.'

567
00:51:30,949 --> 00:51:32,541
'His father's bags the money,'

568
00:51:37,956 --> 00:51:39,890
'Shomu's friend picks the money.'

569
00:51:40,792 --> 00:51:43,989
'Shomu gets a 'payment
received' confirmation.'

570
00:51:56,942 --> 00:52:00,708
'After the confirmation Shomu
prepared for family reunion.'

571
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:09,677
Mama. Look, mama,
Monu is back. Mama.

572
00:52:09,755 --> 00:52:11,655
Mama, look, Monu is back.

573
00:52:12,491 --> 00:52:15,324
Look, mama, there he is.
- Monu. - Monu.

574
00:52:15,394 --> 00:52:16,691
Mama, Monu is back. Papa.
- Monu.

575
00:52:16,762 --> 00:52:18,696
Papa, Monu is back.
- Monu.

576
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:21,665
Monu.
- Look, mama.. Mama..

577
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:28,433
Monu. Monu, say something.

578
00:52:31,843 --> 00:52:33,401
'Family reunion.'

579
00:52:45,424 --> 00:52:46,686
Then what happened to Shomu?

580
00:52:47,726 --> 00:52:51,787
The cocaine Shomu's mum
flushed was worth 10 lakhs.

581
00:52:53,999 --> 00:52:57,457
Shomu's chubby,
brother was worth 20 lakhs.

582
00:52:57,969 --> 00:53:00,597
Profit, 10 lakhs.

583
00:53:02,441 --> 00:53:06,502
By the way, these days Shomu
is backpacking in Amsterdam.

584
00:53:09,748 --> 00:53:11,306
Let's do it. We should do it.

585
00:53:12,317 --> 00:53:14,911
We can do it. We
will do it. Let's do it.

586
00:53:14,986 --> 00:53:16,283
Should we?
- Yes.

587
00:53:16,354 --> 00:53:17,412
Yes?
- Yes.

588
00:53:17,456 --> 00:53:18,548
Sure?
- Yes.

589
00:53:20,959 --> 00:53:24,827
Ya?! Sounds good? You keep feeding
him with these ridiculous stories..

590
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:26,761
..and he falls for it everytime.

591
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:29,926
Do you have a better idea?
Will you give 25 lakhs to the cop?

592
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:31,893
KC, what are you saying?

593
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,395
We'll kidnap someone?
- Yes.

594
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:35,867
KC, this..

595
00:53:35,941 --> 00:53:38,409
I don't want to go
behind bars, Tanya. Do you?

596
00:53:38,743 --> 00:53:40,506
Do you want to go behind bars?
- Okay. Chill.

597
00:53:40,645 --> 00:53:42,613
Assume that we kidnap someone.

598
00:53:42,914 --> 00:53:44,609
Who will we kidnap?

599
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:46,947
Your handicapped sister?

600
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:49,619
Or my brother who is
in the boarding school?

601
00:53:49,855 --> 00:53:51,618
Or Tanya's..
- Me.

602
00:53:52,491 --> 00:53:54,322
What?
- Yes.

603
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,421
My dad's rich. New in town.
Loves me a lot.

604
00:53:57,796 --> 00:53:59,423
Make a phone call.

605
00:54:00,966 --> 00:54:02,228
He'll melt.

606
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,494
Will your dad pay up?

607
00:54:03,768 --> 00:54:06,328
Okay, but if your
dad's rich, new in town..

608
00:54:06,404 --> 00:54:09,339
..loves you a lot then why
don't ask him for money?

609
00:54:09,674 --> 00:54:10,868
Exactly.

610
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:13,341
Because I don't want
to go to a convent.

611
00:54:13,445 --> 00:54:14,537
Convent?

612
00:54:14,613 --> 00:54:17,548
If my dad even gets a hint
about what happened last night..

613
00:54:17,782 --> 00:54:19,249
..that's where Im heading.

614
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:25,588
Will your dad pay up?
- Yes.

615
00:54:00,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Www.mOVIEshareZ.coM

00:54:26,491 --> 00:54:27,890
Of course. He loves me.

617
00:54:28,693 --> 00:54:31,389
Okay. Fine. If we
are kidnapping Amy..

618
00:54:31,463 --> 00:54:33,727
..we'll cab it to her
house in the morning.

619
00:54:33,798 --> 00:54:36,323
And dads bungalow in Khandala..

620
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:37,959
We can stay there.
- No, the bungalow in Nerul.

621
00:54:38,236 --> 00:54:39,635
Perfect. Okay?

622
00:54:41,273 --> 00:54:42,570
I'll make the plan.

623
00:54:45,677 --> 00:54:47,702
You will go to
college as usual, tomorrow.

624
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,241
as soon as the driver leaves..

625
00:54:52,317 --> 00:54:53,682
As soon as the driver leaves..

626
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:56,016
..I'll take a cab
from outside college.

627
00:55:01,326 --> 00:55:02,554
'No, no, no.'

628
00:55:03,228 --> 00:55:04,627
'Come back. Come back.'

629
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:10,633
'Not from outside'

630
00:55:10,669 --> 00:55:11,761
Then?

631
00:55:11,903 --> 00:55:13,837
'You will walk.'
- Okay.

632
00:55:15,407 --> 00:55:16,533
'Keep walking.'

633
00:55:16,841 --> 00:55:18,206
'Keep walking.'

634
00:55:18,376 --> 00:55:19,638
'Keep walking.'

635

00:59:09,607 --> 00:59:12,337
I checked the messages. Everything.

703
00:59:12,577 --> 00:59:13,771

should have checked.

704
00:59:13,845 --> 00:59:15,278
This is your..
- Just.. Just calm down.

705
00:59:15,346 --> 00:59:16,813
You should have at
least looked into this.

706
00:59:17,215 --> 00:59:19,706
You should have checked.

707
00:59:19,784 --> 00:59:21,775
You should've told me. But we have..

708
00:59:22,187 --> 00:59:23,654
Sir.
- You have to calm down, Jai.

709
00:59:23,721 --> 00:59:25,484
I am calm. I am..
- He is trying to do his job, Jai.

710
00:59:25,557 --> 00:59:27,354
No. What? What?
Nothing is being done.

711
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:29,524
Which floor did you throw him from?

712
00:59:31,529 --> 00:59:32,621
First.

713
00:59:32,764 --> 00:59:36,325
He's a Corporater. You
know that, don't you?

714
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:38,669
That's why I threw him
from the first floor, sir.

715
00:59:45,276 --> 00:59:46,470
Look, Mathur..

716
00:59:47,846 --> 00:59:51,907
..it's not that the department
is suddenly in love with you

717
00:59:53,318 --> 00:59:54,615
It's simple.

718
00:59:55,954 --> 00:59:59,720
Its a kidnapping case of
this NRI's 18-year-old daughter.

719
01:00:01,693 --> 01:00:03,888
The Home minister
has called, thrice.

720
01:00:04,596 --> 01:00:05,893
Elections are around the corner.

721
01:00:06,965 --> 01:00:10,401
When these politicians get a chance,
they don't lose the opportunity.

722
01:00:10,535 --> 01:00:13,265
They will screw us cops.

723
01:00:13,371 --> 01:00:14,702
What orders do you have
for me, sir?

724
01:00:15,373 --> 01:00:16,670
You have a good network.

725
01:00:16,975 --> 01:00:18,704
I'll give you the men you want.

726
01:00:19,944 --> 01:00:22,572
You are suspended hence I
can't take you in officially.

727
01:00:23,548 --> 01:00:25,743
But you have to handle this case.

728
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:28,742
without making noise.
At the earliest.

729
01:01:12,964 --> 01:01:14,329
Did you contact Rehmat?

730
01:01:14,499 --> 01:01:15,727
He's not answering the phone.

731
01:01:16,634 --> 01:01:17,828
Get his address.

732
01:01:22,907 --> 01:01:24,272
Her mother.

733
01:01:26,711 --> 01:01:28,906
I'm her step-mom.

734
01:01:29,948 --> 01:01:34,681
its been twelve years since her
mum passed on in a mental asylum.

735
01:01:34,819 --> 01:01:36,343
problems in your family?

736
01:01:36,587 --> 01:01:38,680
Which family doesn't have problems?

737
01:01:41,726 --> 01:01:43,387
I've given the phone
numbers and details..

738
01:01:43,461 --> 01:01:46,328
..of all her friends to the
officer sitting downstairs.

739
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,258
'We just got the news..'

740
01:02:24,335 --> 01:02:26,769
'..that Mr. Anand Jaishankar's
daughter got kidnapped.'

741
01:02:37,248 --> 01:02:40,479
'The kidnapers have called
just once for the ransom.'

742
01:02:40,718 --> 01:02:43,812
'Mumbai police commissioner
has assigned a special team.'

743
01:02:43,988 --> 01:02:45,580
These are her four friends.

744
01:02:46,391 --> 01:02:48,723
Karan Chaudhary. Zubin Shroff.
Tanya Sharma and this guy.

745
01:02:48,926 --> 01:02:50,621
Her parents haven't met him.

746
01:02:50,695 --> 01:02:51,719
Pandey.
- Sir.

747
01:02:51,796 --> 01:02:52,990
I want all the details
on the four of them.

748
01:02:53,264 --> 01:02:54,424
Where do their friends,
parents go and what they do.

749
01:02:54,499 --> 01:02:56,797
The fun they have. Everything.

750
01:04:04,502 --> 01:04:06,766
Are Amrita's friends
behind her kidnapping?

751
01:04:06,838 --> 01:04:09,864
Or is it a case of
multiple kidnapping?

752
01:04:09,941 --> 01:04:12,501
The police have refused
to comment .

753
01:04:12,577 --> 01:04:14,306
As of now the parents
are in a state of shock.

754
01:04:14,378 --> 01:04:15,902
they have refused to
speak to the media.

755
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,379
The three missing
friends are Tanya Sharma..

756
01:04:17,448 --> 01:04:20,281
..Zubin Shroff and Karan Chaudhary.

757
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,211
Move. Move back. No comments.

758
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:27,423
Move back.

759
01:04:27,492 --> 01:04:30,552
No comments.
- Sir. Sir. Sir, please.

760
01:04:30,628 --> 01:04:32,425
Leave us alone.
Please leave us alone.

761
01:04:32,497 --> 01:04:35,330
Please leave us alone.

762
01:04:35,566 --> 01:04:40,469
My sister Tanya Sharma
just signed a three film deal.

763
01:04:40,538 --> 01:04:43,564
I feel a leading
actress is behind this.

764
01:04:43,641 --> 01:04:44,801
Do you suspect anyone, madam?

765
01:04:44,876 --> 01:04:47,811
No, I can't take names. I'm sorry.

766
01:04:49,614 --> 01:04:51,275
The phones of the missing
four are off since morning.

767
01:04:51,382 --> 01:04:52,974
any information on
the fourth person?

768
01:04:53,251 --> 01:04:55,412
The fourth person's name.
Dushant Sahu.

769
01:04:55,486 --> 01:04:57,283
He works at a
coffee shop Carter Road.

770
01:04:57,355 --> 01:04:59,585
He has been arrested
thrice because of drugs.

771
01:04:59,657 --> 01:05:01,522
That too in three different states.

772
01:05:01,726 --> 01:05:03,353
That means in three hours
a single kidnapping case..

773
01:05:03,427 --> 01:05:06,294
..has turned into a
multiple kidnapping case.

774
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:08,557
Was this case given
to me to screw me?

775
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:21,644
Karan is the sole heir to my
business worth 500 crores.

776
01:05:21,979 --> 01:05:25,881
And you are ignoring my son's case
because of an American's daughter.

777
01:05:26,317 --> 01:05:28,877
I have'nt raised my
sister on peanuts.

778
01:05:28,953 --> 01:05:32,218
it has only been a few hours.

779
01:05:32,657 --> 01:05:34,818
And we are taking this
case very seriously.

780
01:05:49,774 --> 01:05:53,335
Dushant Sahu is
your roommate, right?

781
01:05:53,744 --> 01:05:56,008
Where is he? where are his friends?

782
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,248
He is missing since last night.

783
01:05:58,683 --> 01:06:03,416
I know nothing

784
01:06:03,487 --> 01:06:06,354
A new revelation in the
Amrita Jaishankar kidnapping case.

785
01:06:06,524 --> 01:06:09,357
We've figured that
Amrita and her friends'..

786
01:06:09,427 --> 01:06:11,327
..friends can be
behind their kidnapping.

787
01:06:11,395 --> 01:06:14,489
Amrita Jaishankar's father who is
a famous government contractor..

788
01:06:14,565 --> 01:06:16,533
..has been asked to
pay a ransom of 3 crores.

789
01:06:16,601 --> 01:06:18,592
So where exactly is
Amrita Jaishankar?

790
01:06:37,388 --> 01:06:38,548
Look up.

791
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:58,498
Mr. Kibla Rehmatullah
Khan at your service.

792
01:06:59,168 --> 01:07:05,630
''My love, you..''

793
01:07:07,576 --> 01:07:10,773
''Your love..''

794
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:13,247
''My..''

795
01:07:13,715 --> 01:07:15,774
What the hell.

796
01:07:16,452 --> 01:07:18,113
Who is it?
- Son..

797
01:07:18,187 --> 01:07:20,712
Hurry up, son, your wife will age.

798
01:07:20,789 --> 01:07:22,051
Hurry
- I'm coming.

799
01:07:22,124 --> 01:07:23,250
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

800
01:07:23,325 --> 01:07:24,622
let me wear my pants. Do
you want me to come naked?

801
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:29,529
Oh, God. Hurry up.
- Go. I'm coming. Go. Go.

802
01:07:33,402 --> 01:07:37,532
''My love..''

803
01:07:38,407 --> 01:07:40,841
Who is it? - Uncle, they
are calling you downstairs.

804
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:44,238
Bugger off . Scoot!. ''They
are calling you downstairs.''

805
01:07:48,283 --> 01:07:52,549
''My love..''

806
01:07:53,355 --> 01:07:54,413
Who is it?

807
01:07:56,358 --> 01:07:57,416
Sir!

808
01:07:57,493 --> 01:07:59,723
Mr. Mathur, listen to me.
- He is taking your son.

809
01:07:59,761 --> 01:08:01,023
Why are you taking him away?

810
01:08:01,096 --> 01:08:03,758
Listen to me, Mr. Mathur.

811
01:08:04,032 --> 01:08:06,762
Mr. Mathur, I.. I was
going to answer your phone.

812
01:08:15,744 --> 01:08:18,713
Okay, why are we at Vijay
Mallay's kingfisher villa?

813
01:08:19,148 --> 01:08:20,740
Dash, come in. Dash, come in. Dash.

814
01:08:21,183 --> 01:08:23,583
Dash must have
thought of something right?

815
01:08:23,652 --> 01:08:25,142
Dash.
- Balls.

816
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,278
Look at this place.

817
01:08:27,556 --> 01:08:29,148
What food do you want?

818
01:08:29,758 --> 01:08:30,816
Food.

819
01:08:32,728 --> 01:08:34,593
such an exciting place.

820
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:36,829
My arse.

821
01:08:37,065 --> 01:08:40,796
you outsiders always find
the filth in India exciting.

822
01:08:41,069 --> 01:08:44,561
Blah. Blah. Blah.

823
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,130
Such nags.

824
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:47,800
Dash, tell them about the plan.

825
01:08:48,577 --> 01:08:50,568
Are you done with your shit?

826
01:08:53,081 --> 01:08:54,105
This is my friend's lodge.

827
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:57,111
It's obvious from its looks.

828
01:08:58,086 --> 01:09:00,145
Don't talk, listen.

829
01:09:03,091 --> 01:09:05,651
My friend will be coming here
with an unregistered SIM card.

830
01:09:05,727 --> 01:09:08,662
We'll make our next and perhaps
our last phone call from it.

831
01:09:09,064 --> 01:09:11,123
Hi, my name is Zubin.

832
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,326
I am a Parsee boy.

833
01:09:13,335 --> 01:09:15,633
I play with myself as well
while playing videogames.

834
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:26,504
Sir.

835
01:09:29,151 --> 01:09:32,348
Mr. Mathur, please let me go.

836
01:09:33,155 --> 01:09:34,554
Sir, my informer will
be here soon.

837
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:38,357
Sir, have I ever given
you wrong information?

838
01:09:39,394 --> 01:09:41,191
Sir, you have stripped me
from the middle of my wedding.

839
01:09:41,263 --> 01:09:42,696
It's a sin, sir.

840
01:09:43,632 --> 01:09:45,190
Sir, please let me go.

841
01:09:45,834 --> 01:09:48,632
Sir, I'm starting afresh

842
01:09:48,704 --> 01:09:50,103
What's the point in
getting married?

843
01:09:50,205 --> 01:09:51,263
What will you do?

844
01:09:54,042 --> 01:09:56,101
Everything will be over in 8 months.

845
01:09:56,178 --> 01:09:58,510
And your wife will leave
with the painting you paid for.

846
01:09:59,248 --> 01:10:01,113
He wants to start
a new life he says.

847
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:03,509
Sir, panting? Sir?

848
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,180
Two. Three. Four.

849
01:10:11,126 --> 01:10:12,252
Stupid.

850
01:10:12,327 --> 01:10:14,022
Where will we ask
him to get the money?

851
01:10:15,464 --> 01:10:16,624
Outside that shop?

852
01:10:16,698 --> 01:10:18,632
Or that one
selling bras and panties?

853
01:10:19,468 --> 01:10:20,492
Chill, Parsee.

854
01:10:22,204 --> 01:10:23,171
What about the police?

855
01:10:23,405 --> 01:10:24,804
Why do you ask so many questions?

856
01:10:25,307 --> 01:10:26,740
What if Amy's dad brings
the police?

857
01:10:28,477 --> 01:10:31,310
Then we will cut Amy
into tiny pieces..

858
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:33,814
..and feed her to the dogs.
- No.

859
01:10:34,082 --> 01:10:36,676
KC, Zubi has got a point here.

860
01:10:37,252 --> 01:10:39,083
Okay. Okay. no need for drama

861
01:10:39,121 --> 01:10:40,645
Save that for your
television serials.

862
01:10:41,156 --> 01:10:42,214
Get lost.

863
01:10:43,158 --> 01:10:45,149
Zubi, give me the phone.
I want to call my sister.

864
01:10:45,227 --> 01:10:46,285
No phone calls.

865
01:10:46,728 --> 01:10:48,696
If we switch on the phone there
is a risk of being tracked down.

866
01:10:49,831 --> 01:10:52,800
Track down? Who will track us down?

867
01:10:53,168 --> 01:10:54,499
Police?
- Maybe.

868
01:10:56,672 --> 01:10:59,300
If and only if Amy's dad
has told them everything.

869
01:10:59,675 --> 01:11:01,108
That means until now you
guys where confident..

870
01:11:01,176 --> 01:11:03,144
..that the cops aren't involved.

871
01:11:03,211 --> 01:11:04,337
And suddenly it's a maybe.

872
01:11:04,746 --> 01:11:08,512
Tell me, KC, why did you
get Kareena Kapoor along?

873
01:11:08,717 --> 01:11:09,775
For Saif.

874
01:11:10,519 --> 01:11:11,645
Kareena. Saif.

875
01:11:12,254 --> 01:11:16,247
Hey guys, seriously, this is
not a 'Safe' place to meet.

876
01:11:17,659 --> 01:11:20,457
That's really funny, man.
- That's a good Parsee come back.

877
01:11:21,263 --> 01:11:22,093
Hello, sir.

878
01:11:22,164 --> 01:11:24,257
It's confirmed news. A
15-16 year old girl.

879
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:25,800
Looks European. Golden hair.

880
01:11:26,034 --> 01:11:27,467
Did you see any weapons there?
- No, sir.

881
01:11:27,536 --> 01:11:28,764
I didn't see any weapons.

882
01:11:29,037 --> 01:11:31,471
But yes, the girl was coked up.

883
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,631
Let's go.

884
01:11:33,709 --> 01:11:36,473
Sir. Sir. Sir. Can I leave?
- Go.

885
01:11:58,133 --> 01:12:00,294
Amy. Amy, look here.

886
01:12:00,635 --> 01:12:01,624
Amy, look at this. Look at this.

887
01:12:04,172 --> 01:12:06,231
'The kidnapping case
of Amrita Jaishankar..'

888
01:12:06,308 --> 01:12:08,139
'..has taken a completely new turn.'

889
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:10,303
'Right now the police are not
only looking for this young girl..'

890
01:12:10,379 --> 01:12:12,244
'..but also for three
of her friends

891
01:12:12,314 --> 01:12:13,747
'..who disappeared
the same time as her.'

892
01:12:14,015 --> 01:12:16,245
'There has been no ransom call
to any of her other friends.'

893
01:12:16,318 --> 01:12:18,252
'And the police
are yet to confirm..'

894
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,447
'..whether the friends are the
victims or indeed the kidnappers.'

895
01:12:20,722 --> 01:12:23,384
There's a lot of speculation
where the youngster might be hiding.

896
01:12:23,458 --> 01:12:25,426
The police
currently traced the call..

897
01:12:35,704 --> 01:12:39,071
Leave me. Brother,
whom have you brought?

898
01:12:39,141 --> 01:12:41,336
Help! You want to put
me in trouble?

899
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:44,673
KC. KC.

900
01:12:45,614 --> 01:12:48,344
Bolt the door. Leave me.

901
01:12:49,518 --> 01:12:51,611
'We now have pictures of
the four missing youngsters.'

902
01:12:51,686 --> 01:12:53,415
'The parents have
offered reward to anyone..'

903
01:12:53,488 --> 01:12:56,013
..who can provide the police with
information on their whereabouts.'

904
01:13:04,666 --> 01:13:08,261
Leave me! Leave me!

905
01:13:10,272 --> 01:13:11,330
Help!

906
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,429
Help!

907
01:13:12,507 --> 01:13:14,441
Do you want us killed?
Let go of her.

908
01:13:19,181 --> 01:13:21,046
Shut up! Shut up, you witch!

909
01:13:24,519 --> 01:13:29,252
Leave me! Leave me!

910
01:13:32,727 --> 01:13:34,251
Who are you?
- How can you just barge in?

911
01:13:34,329 --> 01:13:35,387
Leave.
- Get out of here.

912
01:13:35,464 --> 01:13:36,522
I said get out of here.

913
01:13:36,598 --> 01:13:38,759
Sit down.
- How dare you come inside?

914
01:13:39,034 --> 01:13:40,331
Sit down. Sit down.

915
01:13:40,402 --> 01:13:42,336
You are pointing a gun
at me in front of a kid?

916
01:13:43,705 --> 01:13:44,763
Help! Help!

917
01:13:47,576 --> 01:13:48,770
Who are you?
- Get out of here.

918
01:13:49,044 --> 01:13:50,306
Get out. - You are pointing a
gun at me in front of a kid?

919
01:13:50,378 --> 01:13:51,606
I said sit down. Raise your hands.

920
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,738
I told you.
- Yes..

921
01:13:52,814 --> 01:13:54,008
Shut up! Shut up!

922
01:14:14,703 --> 01:14:16,227
No.

923
01:14:26,248 --> 01:14:27,545
Don't you have any shame?

924
01:14:27,616 --> 01:14:28,742
You are pointing a gun at
me in front of a kid?

925
01:14:29,017 --> 01:14:30,575
Get out of here.
- Arvind, is everything alright?

926
01:14:33,388 --> 01:14:36,050
Let's go, guys. Let's go. Let's go.

927
01:14:39,594 --> 01:14:41,255
Hey, stop. Stop right there.

928
01:14:41,329 --> 01:14:45,698
Go upstairs. Go upstairs.
Go upstairs. Run. Run. Run.

929
01:14:52,274 --> 01:14:53,400
Hurry up. Run.

930
01:15:04,352 --> 01:15:05,717
Keep quiet.
- No, get out of here.

931
01:15:05,987 --> 01:15:07,045
Keep quiet.
- Get out of here.

932
01:15:07,389 --> 01:15:08,447
I said, get out.

933
01:15:10,525 --> 01:15:12,550
Come on, kick the door.
Kick the door.

934
01:18:34,763 --> 01:18:37,789
I'm standing right outside the lodge
where the gun fight took place.

935
01:18:38,066 --> 01:18:40,660
The two Kenyan
nationals Omar and Tofeeq..

936
01:18:40,735 --> 01:18:42,703
..had entered the
country a month ago..

937
01:18:42,771 --> 01:18:44,466
..to deliver a heavy
consignment of cocaine.

938
01:18:44,539 --> 01:18:47,099
Both of them were being
haboured by an Indian family..

939
01:18:47,175 --> 01:18:50,235
..Kadija and Mustaq Ansari,
who have just been arrested.

940
01:18:50,478 --> 01:18:53,777
Also found dead on the spot was
Germany tourist Claudia Jones..

941
01:18:54,048 --> 01:18:55,640
..who was reported
missing by German embassy..

942
01:18:55,717 --> 01:18:57,275
..around four weeks ago.

943
01:18:57,652 --> 01:19:01,053
Her cause of death has been
confirmed as a overdose of cocaine.

944
01:19:01,089 --> 01:19:04,422
Sir, it's like you go for a
prayer and you end up fasting.

945
01:19:04,492 --> 01:19:06,653
Your Mumbai police was
looking for Amrita Jaishankar..

946
01:19:06,728 --> 01:19:09,663
..but it got a Germany
citizen missing since four weeks..

947
01:19:09,697 --> 01:19:12,029
..Claudia's dead body.

948
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,294
What do you have to say about this?

949
01:19:13,368 --> 01:19:15,802
Excuse me. What do you think?

950
01:19:16,171 --> 01:19:18,571
That police handles
only one case at a time?

951
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,370
For us, each and
every case is important.

952
01:19:21,442 --> 01:19:23,672
If we have Amrita's
case it doesn't mean..

953
01:19:23,745 --> 01:19:26,270
..that we ignore Claudia's case.

954
01:19:26,414 --> 01:19:29,212
Please. Our experts' team has
been investigating this case..

955
01:19:29,284 --> 01:19:31,343
For the past four weeks.

956
01:19:31,419 --> 01:19:34,752
And what is so surprising
if we find Claudia Jones?

957
01:19:34,823 --> 01:19:37,087
I am surprised at your behaviour.

958
01:19:37,158 --> 01:19:40,423
You are looking for drama even
when the police has done good work.

959
01:19:40,695 --> 01:19:43,459
Saw how the
commissioner is fooling people?

960
01:19:44,065 --> 01:19:46,659
So what?
- What did the doctor say?

961
01:19:46,734 --> 01:19:48,258
I've already been shot thrice.

962
01:19:48,336 --> 01:19:49,633
Doctor said if I get shot again..

963
01:19:49,704 --> 01:19:50,728
..there will be no blood
left in my body.

964
01:19:50,805 --> 01:19:52,397
Sir, where is Amrita?

965
01:19:54,609 --> 01:19:55,667
Doctor said that?

966
01:19:57,612 --> 01:19:58,670
Sandeep, crabs don't
have any blood in them..

967
01:19:58,746 --> 01:20:00,213
..and cops don't have
a single loyal bone.

968
01:20:00,281 --> 01:20:01,407
Now what you think is what you are.

969
01:20:03,384 --> 01:20:04,442
Did you find anything
in the laptop?

970
01:20:04,519 --> 01:20:07,044
No. And nothing in the
Facebook account as well.

971
01:20:07,121 --> 01:20:08,520
Except sympathy messages.

972
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:10,490
About 3000 of them
but nothing suspicious.

973
01:20:10,558 --> 01:20:11,650
Anything from the tracking device?

974
01:20:11,726 --> 01:20:13,717
I have diverted the phone
calls of all the parents here.

975
01:20:14,329 --> 01:20:16,194
In about 20 minutes I will be
able to crack anyone calling.

976
01:20:16,231 --> 01:20:17,289
Inspector.

977
01:20:17,365 --> 01:20:19,663
And the terrestrial
tracking software which helps in..

978
01:20:19,734 --> 01:20:20,792
Inspector.

979
01:20:24,072 --> 01:20:29,442
Yes, ma'am?
- How old was that girl?

980
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:31,239
17.

981
01:20:34,716 --> 01:20:35,774
Jai..

982
01:20:36,718 --> 01:20:38,652
Jai, we have lost her.

983
01:20:44,626 --> 01:20:47,094
Jai, what am I going to do?

984
01:21:17,759 --> 01:21:21,217
How.. All of us kidnapped?

985
01:21:23,064 --> 01:21:24,497
I don't understand anything.

986
01:21:24,532 --> 01:21:26,193
I also don't understand.

987
01:21:26,601 --> 01:21:29,365
Does the hero love the
milkmaid or the other item girl?

988
01:21:30,338 --> 01:21:32,636
Amy
- Can you guys just stop it?

989
01:21:34,342 --> 01:21:35,775
If we don't go home for few hours..

990
01:21:36,044 --> 01:21:36,772
..does it mean
that we are kidnapped?

991
01:21:39,347 --> 01:21:41,815
Dash. Dash.

992
01:21:43,384 --> 01:21:44,578
What's the plan, now?

993
01:21:45,586 --> 01:21:49,249
KC, your dad can solve this.

994
01:21:50,058 --> 01:21:51,252
Let's go back.

995
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,320
Go back?

996
01:21:53,461 --> 01:21:54,519
Tanya..

997
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:03,996
What do you think? The cops are
doing a striptease in the station?

998
01:22:06,441 --> 01:22:09,001
If we go back, they will
badger each one of us..

999
01:22:09,077 --> 01:22:11,375
..where we were and
what were we doing.

1000
01:22:11,612 --> 01:22:16,049
One wrong answer and you
will be thrashed in such a way..

1001
01:22:16,117 --> 01:22:17,345
..that you will never forget.

1002
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:21,211
We don't have the
money and on top of that..

1003
01:22:21,289 --> 01:22:23,018
..Malwankar is
sitting over our heads.

1004
01:22:25,793 --> 01:22:28,057
We will call
everyone's dads tonight.

1005
01:22:28,629 --> 01:22:31,029
And decide the drop off point.
- Okay.

1006
01:22:31,232 --> 01:22:32,221
Why everyone's dads?

1007
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,029
Why not ask when we
have the opportunity.

1008
01:22:34,202 --> 01:22:36,227
According to the media all
four of you got kidnapped, right?

1009
01:22:38,673 --> 01:22:40,436
Then how much money will we get?

1010
01:22:40,508 --> 01:22:42,339
Amy.
- What?

1011
01:22:44,045 --> 01:22:45,444
25 from your dad.

1012
01:22:46,514 --> 01:22:48,243
We will get 25 from his dad.

1013
01:22:49,317 --> 01:22:50,443
10 from Zubin's dad.

1014
01:22:54,088 --> 01:22:57,387
And from Tanya's sister,
perhaps 1500.

1015
01:23:01,029 --> 01:23:02,496
All of you wait here.
I'll go and make the calls.

1016
01:23:02,563 --> 01:23:04,030
Wait. I'll come along.

1017
01:23:04,098 --> 01:23:06,191
You stay here. Take care of them.

1018
01:23:17,178 --> 01:23:18,270
KC.

1019
01:23:18,346 --> 01:23:19,404
What's happening?

1020
01:23:20,214 --> 01:23:21,408
Can't you see it?

1021
01:23:21,749 --> 01:23:23,011
Don't you understand?

1022
01:23:23,351 --> 01:23:24,409
What do you mean?

1023
01:23:24,485 --> 01:23:26,009
Dash is a big bullshitter.

1024
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:31,021
You are agreeing to
whatever he is saying.

1025
01:23:31,092 --> 01:23:32,150
Nothing like that.

1026
01:23:32,226 --> 01:23:33,420
Whose plan it was to
kidnap someone?

1027
01:23:35,329 --> 01:23:38,059
And now.. He is asking a
ransom from everyone's dads.

1028
01:23:38,499 --> 01:23:41,059
And why did he hit him so badly?

1029
01:23:42,537 --> 01:23:45,062
Yes. Why did he hit him?

1030
01:23:45,406 --> 01:23:47,135
He should have just
watch me get raped, right?

1031
01:23:47,175 --> 01:23:49,075
Just cool it, you know.

1032
01:47:00,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Www.mOVIEshareZ.coM

1033
01:23:49,143 --> 01:23:51,077
Rape? What rape?

1034
01:23:51,312 --> 01:23:53,177
You both looked like you
were made for each other.

1035
01:23:53,247 --> 01:23:55,044
Didn't you see their..

1036
01:23:55,316 --> 01:23:56,510
..chemistry?

1037
01:23:58,586 --> 01:23:59,644
Tanya.
- Tanya.

1038
01:23:59,687 --> 01:24:01,177
Stupid. Listen..
- Tanya.

1039
01:24:06,327 --> 01:24:07,988
Zubi, go.

1040
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:09,755
Tanya.

1041
01:24:15,703 --> 01:24:17,364
I'm leaving.
- Look, don't take..

1042
01:24:17,438 --> 01:24:19,599
I'm leaving.
- Don't take Amy seriously.

1043
01:24:23,611 --> 01:24:26,205
Zubi, we.. We are all going to die.

1044
01:24:27,048 --> 01:24:28,606
See, I.. I know

1045
01:24:28,683 --> 01:24:30,617
I am freaking out, too.

1046
01:24:30,685 --> 01:24:32,209
Everything will be fine.

1047
01:24:34,388 --> 01:24:37,152
What will be fine, Zubi?

1048
01:24:37,658 --> 01:24:39,216
I was almost raped.

1049
01:24:40,595 --> 01:24:41,687
Reped. Zubi.

1050
01:24:46,367 --> 01:24:50,235
Two days ago we ran
over and killed two men.

1051
01:24:53,374 --> 01:24:54,966
And in that lodge, that..

1052
01:24:55,176 --> 01:24:57,576
We killed that bastard.
- There's no proof.

1053
01:24:57,645 --> 01:24:59,510
I mean like, he
could still be alive.

1054
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:01,013
What difference does it make?

1055
01:25:01,983 --> 01:25:03,382
What difference does it make?

1056
01:25:27,275 --> 01:25:29,402
Please, get me out of here.

1057
01:25:31,312 --> 01:25:32,506
Please.

1058
01:25:35,116 --> 01:25:36,413
Zubi.

1059
01:25:38,052 --> 01:25:39,747
I cannot leave KC.

1060
01:25:43,324 --> 01:25:48,023
You love me, right?

1061
01:25:50,198 --> 01:25:51,495
Please, get me out of here.

1062
01:25:51,566 --> 01:25:55,058
I want to go home, Zubi.

1063
01:25:55,136 --> 01:25:58,162
I don't want to do this anymore.

1064
01:25:58,339 --> 01:25:59,966
Please Zubi.

1065
01:26:00,441 --> 01:26:04,036
Take me home. Please.

1066
01:26:06,581 --> 01:26:07,741
Please.

1067
01:26:10,418 --> 01:26:11,442
I'll..

1068
01:26:13,621 --> 01:26:15,384
..get a cab.

1069
01:26:19,126 --> 01:26:21,117
I'll come with you.

1070
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:25,462
They will suspect us
if we go together.

1071
01:26:27,735 --> 01:26:30,260
If they ask, just
make up something, okay?

1072
01:26:30,338 --> 01:26:33,102
Say that I have gone to
get food or something.

1073
01:26:34,075 --> 01:26:35,542
Okay?
- Okay.

1074
01:26:35,743 --> 01:26:41,045
Zubi, I want your phone.
I want to call my sister.

1075
01:26:42,617 --> 01:26:44,107
Please.

1076
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:56,096
Don't worry? We are
doing the right thing.

1077
01:27:00,668 --> 01:27:03,296
Now we need 50.. not 25 lakhs.

1078
01:27:03,604 --> 01:27:06,801
Tomorrow 11:30am sharp.
Outside the Goodluck restaurant.

1079
01:27:07,308 --> 01:27:08,502
Lower Parel.

1080
01:27:08,576 --> 01:27:11,272
Come alone. If you bring
the police along then..

1081
01:27:11,312 --> 01:27:13,075
You will get the money.

1082
01:27:13,147 --> 01:27:14,478
Balwant, who is the SI
of that area?

1083
01:27:14,548 --> 01:27:16,482
Please don't hurt Amy.

1084
01:27:16,684 --> 01:27:18,447
Can I speak to Amy?

1085
01:27:18,686 --> 01:27:20,176
Hello. Hello.

1086
01:27:20,254 --> 01:27:21,380
What date is it tomorrow?

1087
01:28:04,598 --> 01:28:05,758
Give me that.

1088
01:28:07,501 --> 01:28:09,264
Give it back to me.

1089
01:28:12,173 --> 01:28:14,573
I'll kill you.
- Let me go.

1090
01:28:17,378 --> 01:28:18,367
What's going on?

1091
01:28:18,446 --> 01:28:19,572
Yes?

1092
01:28:19,647 --> 01:28:20,545
What's going on?

1093
01:28:20,614 --> 01:28:21,808
I'll tell you what's going on.

1094
01:28:22,116 --> 01:28:24,107
The bitch was calling the cops.

1095
01:28:24,151 --> 01:28:26,051
I was not calling the cops.

1096
01:28:26,354 --> 01:28:27,753
Tanya.
- Just stay here.

1097
01:28:27,822 --> 01:28:30,347
I'm not going anywhere.
- You were calling the cops.

1098
01:28:30,391 --> 01:28:32,188
KC, I didn't call the cops.
- Bitch.

1099
01:28:32,226 --> 01:28:33,488
Where did you get the phone?

1100
01:28:33,561 --> 01:28:34,687
Who gave you this phone?
- Trust, huh?

1101
01:28:34,762 --> 01:28:36,093
Where's Zubin?

1102
01:28:36,197 --> 01:28:37,129
He is out to get food.

1103
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:39,063
Trust? Trust.
- You bitch.

1104
01:28:39,166 --> 01:28:41,293
Trust means shit, doesn't it?
- You bitch.

1105
01:28:41,369 --> 01:28:43,269
Who broke our trust?

1106
01:28:46,073 --> 01:28:47,335
Everything has
happened because of you, KC.

1107
01:28:47,408 --> 01:28:49,069
Everything has
happened because of you.

1108
01:29:09,029 --> 01:29:10,155
Tanya, get up.

1109
01:29:10,231 --> 01:29:11,323
Amy.

1110
01:29:12,166 --> 01:29:13,155
Tanya.

1111
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:24,634
I hope she..

1112
01:29:45,433 --> 01:29:46,457
KC.

1113
01:29:46,667 --> 01:29:47,599
Tanya.

1114
01:29:56,277 --> 01:29:57,369
Zubin.

1115
01:29:58,112 --> 01:29:59,136
Zubin.

1116
01:31:04,678 --> 01:31:06,407
Which information are you
talking about? - Don't shout, sir.

1117
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,142
Of course, I will shout.
- No, you don't have to shout.

1118
01:31:09,216 --> 01:31:11,548
Who is he to tell me not to shout?

1119
01:31:11,619 --> 01:31:13,246
One by one.

1120
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,515
You think your brother
will ever come back?

1121
01:31:15,589 --> 01:31:17,523
Please. Stop it.

1122
01:31:17,591 --> 01:31:19,058
That's enough.

1123
01:31:19,126 --> 01:31:20,559
Please, sir.

1124
01:32:00,067 --> 01:32:01,432
Our sources have just informed us..

1125
01:32:01,502 --> 01:32:04,699
Tanya Sharma has been found.

1126
01:32:04,772 --> 01:32:06,569
Tanya Sharma has been found.

1127
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:09,541
Still no news on Amrita Jaishankar.

1128
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:48,439
Stay here till I don't return.

1129
01:33:20,514 --> 01:33:21,538
Where are you?

1130
01:33:21,615 --> 01:33:23,708
On second floor in
the opposite building.

1131
01:33:56,050 --> 01:33:58,382
Yes, sir, I can see him.

1132
01:34:22,209 --> 01:34:23,642
Why did Mahabharata take place?

1133
01:34:24,244 --> 01:34:26,212
Because Draupadi laughed.

1134
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:28,514
I found this audio
clip in Amy's laptop.

1135
01:34:29,049 --> 01:34:30,744
It matches with the ransom call.

1136
01:34:31,351 --> 01:34:34,548
I'm 100% sure its Dushyant Sahu.

1137
01:34:35,456 --> 01:34:37,117
Did our hero come to
pick up the money?

1138
01:34:38,625 --> 01:34:40,320
No

1139
01:34:41,328 --> 01:34:42,488
I don't think he will.

1140
01:35:54,101 --> 01:35:55,500
Tanya.

1141
01:35:57,638 --> 01:35:58,662
Tanya, listen to me.

1142
01:36:16,456 --> 01:36:17,445
Tanu.

1143
01:36:21,762 --> 01:36:23,127
Tanya.

1144
01:36:27,067 --> 01:36:28,125
Tanya.

1145
01:36:30,103 --> 01:36:31,229
Tanya.

1146
01:36:42,349 --> 01:36:43,543
Hello.

1147
01:36:45,219 --> 01:36:46,208
Yes.

1148
01:36:48,055 --> 01:36:49,249
So?

1149
01:36:51,692 --> 01:36:52,784
So what were the others doing?

1150
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:54,186
Where they busy celebrating
Lord Krishna's birthday?

1151
01:36:54,261 --> 01:36:56,092
Sir, actually..
- Just a minute, Mathur.

1152
01:36:56,263 --> 01:36:57,696
Is this a joke?

1153
01:36:58,065 --> 01:37:00,295
It has been more than 48 hours.
What have we done?

1154
01:37:00,534 --> 01:37:02,331
We found that German
girl Claudia by fluke.

1155
01:37:02,402 --> 01:37:03,767
We had one chance but
we lost that as well.

1156
01:37:04,037 --> 01:37:06,801
There's a half dead
girl lying in here..

1157
01:37:07,074 --> 01:37:08,473
..who might die as I speak.

1158
01:37:08,575 --> 01:37:09,735
Sir, I know that, but..

1159
01:37:09,810 --> 01:37:11,710
You don't know anything, Mathur.

1160
01:37:11,778 --> 01:37:13,746
Is the media targeting you?

1161
01:37:14,181 --> 01:37:17,514
They have linked everything to this
case from terrorism to black magic.

1162
01:37:17,584 --> 01:37:19,211
There is a lot of
pressure on me, Mathur.

1163
01:37:19,286 --> 01:37:20,548
I keep getting
calls from my seniors.

1164
01:37:20,587 --> 01:37:22,555
I'm repeatedly being told that
they will give the case to CBI..

1165
01:37:22,623 --> 01:37:24,648
Sir, I'll talk to you later.
- You..

1166
01:37:27,794 --> 01:37:29,819
Sir, we found him
outside the airport.

1167
01:37:30,097 --> 01:37:31,655
His father was
sending him to Bangalore.

1168
01:37:32,599 --> 01:37:34,191
Did he say anything?
- No, sir.

1169
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:41,837
I want my lawyer.

1170
01:37:45,145 --> 01:37:47,113
What did you think you are
sitting in an American prison?

1171
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:48,442
It's my right.

1172
01:37:48,849 --> 01:37:51,340
Only the police are right
during an interrogation.

1173
01:37:51,418 --> 01:37:54,615
No one will come to know even if
I bump you off in an encounter.

1174
01:37:54,655 --> 01:37:55,713
Got it?

1175
01:38:00,394 --> 01:38:03,329
Now tell me, where are
the rest of your friends?

1176
01:38:03,697 --> 01:38:06,097
Otherwise, along with you, your
parents, too, won't get a lawyer.

1177
01:38:07,768 --> 01:38:08,757
Tell me.

1178
01:38:13,407 --> 01:38:14,339
Okay, don't tell me.

1179
01:38:15,609 --> 01:38:17,600
I'll book you for Tanya's murder.

1180
01:38:19,613 --> 01:38:21,080
You killed Tanya, didn't you?

1181
01:38:21,148 --> 01:38:22,547
No, sir. I didn't.

1182
01:38:22,649 --> 01:38:24,514
You killed Tanya, didn't you?
- No, sir. I didn't.

1183
01:38:26,119 --> 01:38:27,643
Never

1184
01:38:27,821 --> 01:38:30,449
I had told them I don't
want to be a part of this.

1185
01:38:31,124 --> 01:38:32,250
They..

1186
01:38:34,127 --> 01:38:35,492
I got scared, sir.

1187
01:38:37,798 --> 01:38:39,129
I got scared.

1188
01:38:40,801 --> 01:38:42,666
Look, you couldn't save Tanya.

1189
01:38:43,470 --> 01:38:45,700
But you can save yourself trust me.

1190
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:48,330
Trust a cop?

1191
01:38:50,544 --> 01:38:52,478
All this has
happened because of a cop.

1192
01:38:54,414 --> 01:38:55,711
What do you mean?

1193
01:38:57,117 --> 01:38:58,379
Let us pray.

1194
01:38:59,353 --> 01:39:02,618
Almighty God, whose
blessed son bears our grief..

1195
01:39:02,689 --> 01:39:07,251
..and carries our sorrows,
grant faith and courage..

1196
01:39:07,327 --> 01:39:10,592
..to all who are
suffering at this time.

1197
01:39:10,664 --> 01:39:12,655
And give your
strength and blessing..

1198
01:39:12,733 --> 01:39:15,463
..to those who seek to help them.

1199
01:39:15,802 --> 01:39:18,293
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

1200
01:39:18,638 --> 01:39:19,696
Amen.

1201
01:39:42,129 --> 01:39:43,187
Amy..

1202
01:39:44,664 --> 01:39:47,462
Someone must have taken
her to the hospital, right?

1203
01:39:51,138 --> 01:39:52,400
Amy, you think she's okay?

1204
01:39:55,275 --> 01:39:56,765
I think I should call her.

1205
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:01,474
Yes, I'll call her.

1206
01:40:02,649 --> 01:40:06,176
No.. No one will believe
that it was an accident, KC.

1207
01:40:06,386 --> 01:40:09,082
I know how it works.
That's the way it works.

1208
01:40:10,424 --> 01:40:13,188
No one believed my mother either.

1209
01:40:15,095 --> 01:40:16,426
They just locked her up.

1210
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:21,465
They are going to lock us up, too.

1211
01:40:22,436 --> 01:40:25,769
Once we get the money..
Then.. then.. then..

1212
01:40:26,173 --> 01:40:29,199
Then we should leave. Yes.
Then we have to get out of here.

1213
01:40:29,276 --> 01:40:31,039
We have to leave.

1214
01:40:32,379 --> 01:40:33,641
We'll go to LA.

1215
01:40:34,214 --> 01:40:37,445
For a few days I'll
request them to let my mom out.

1216
01:40:37,517 --> 01:40:38,484
You can meet my mom.

1217
01:40:38,552 --> 01:40:42,044
What crap are you ranting?
- Her eyes are so beautiful.

1218
01:40:42,122 --> 01:40:43,555
she paints so well.

1219
01:40:43,657 --> 01:40:44,646
You have to see her paintings.
- What happened?

1220
01:40:44,724 --> 01:40:46,055
She's amazing.

1221
01:40:46,193 --> 01:40:48,218
I didn't get the money.
Cops all around.

1222
01:40:49,162 --> 01:40:51,494
Dash, don't lie. Where's the money?

1223
01:40:52,432 --> 01:40:53,364
Where's the money?

1224
01:40:56,036 --> 01:40:58,368
Your dad had made
all the arrangements.

1225
01:40:59,005 --> 01:41:00,472
I would've got caught if I
had gone to take the money.

1226
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:01,768
It would have been better
if you would've got caught.

1227
01:41:02,042 --> 01:41:03,066
What?

1228
01:41:04,344 --> 01:41:05,470
Move.

1229
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:07,674
No.
- Where are you going?

1230
01:41:08,148 --> 01:41:10,116
I'm hungry. I'm
going to get some food.

1231
01:41:14,721 --> 01:41:16,780
From our department?
- Yes, sir.

1232
01:41:17,591 --> 01:41:19,024
Zubin is telling the truth.

1233
01:41:19,092 --> 01:41:21,720
all rascals cooking up a story.

1234
01:41:22,496 --> 01:41:25,431
It's part of the plan blame a cop.

1235
01:41:25,499 --> 01:41:28,468
Mathur, I am not getting emotional..

1236
01:41:28,535 --> 01:41:31,197
..because Malwankar or
whoever he is, is a cop.

1237
01:41:32,272 --> 01:41:34,604
While sitting here, I know
whose uniform gets ironed where.

1238
01:41:35,075 --> 01:41:36,565
Please, sir. Listen to me.
- Mathur.

1239
01:41:36,643 --> 01:41:38,235
Enough is enough.

1240
01:41:38,311 --> 01:41:39,335
Enough is enough indeed.

1241
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,674
You solve this case and
get yourself transferred.

1242
01:41:42,749 --> 01:41:44,478
Listening to a kid
you are acting insane..

1243
01:41:44,551 --> 01:41:47,076
I'ts not nonsense im not
getting instigated by a kid, sir.

1244
01:41:47,521 --> 01:41:49,546
I've been trying to tell you
since long you are not getting me.

1245
01:41:49,756 --> 01:41:51,223
I've done my background check, sir.

1246
01:41:52,192 --> 01:41:53,625
Sorry won't be able to do this.

1247
01:41:54,427 --> 01:41:57,555
Sir. Sir, Pratham has called in.

1248
01:41:57,631 --> 01:41:58,689
The phone number given by
Zubin Shroff belongs..

1249
01:41:58,765 --> 01:42:00,323
..to some Gauri Malwankar.

1250
01:42:03,503 --> 01:42:06,472
Patel, keep in mind that
he shouldn't find out..

1251
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:07,598
..that we know about him.
- Swine.

1252
01:42:07,674 --> 01:42:09,005
No one will send a
message to the wireless.

1253
01:42:09,042 --> 01:42:10,771
I've already given a
message to the wireless.

1254
01:42:11,011 --> 01:42:12,069
With whose permission?

1255
01:42:12,145 --> 01:42:13,578
With whose.. Sorry.

1256
01:42:16,216 --> 01:42:17,478
Sandeep, let's go.

1257
01:42:18,485 --> 01:42:19,577
Let's go.

1258
01:42:30,063 --> 01:42:32,054
Gopi must be on his
way back from school.

1259
01:42:32,566 --> 01:42:34,295
Where are you going?

1260
01:42:34,367 --> 01:42:36,130
Have your lunch.
I'll be back in an hour.

1261
01:42:36,203 --> 01:42:37,500
Gauri Malwankar?
- Okay?

1262
01:42:42,309 --> 01:42:43,503
Shut up.

1263
01:42:45,312 --> 01:42:48,304
I said shut up. He
shouldn't find out.

1264
01:43:08,735 --> 01:43:10,066
Where were you?

1265
01:43:38,632 --> 01:43:39,792
Move aside. Move aside.

Forget it.

Yes.

1279
01:46:32,505 --> 01:46:35,065
Arvind, Nandini had come to my
clinic. She's had a small accident.

1280
01:46:35,141 --> 01:46:36,540
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1281
01:46:36,609 --> 01:46:39,134
There is a fracture,
but it's nothing serious.

1282
01:46:39,212 --> 01:46:41,180
Don't worry. Listen,
Arvind. Listen to me. Arvind..

1283
01:46:42,582 --> 01:46:44,209
What is it?
- Stop.

01:46:45,452 --> 01:46:46,350
You handle this.

1286
01:46:47,554 --> 01:46:49,146
Where are you going?

1287
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:51,487
Arvind.

1288
01:47:09,342 --> 01:47:10,570
Why have you come here?

1289
01:47:13,112 --> 01:47:14,704
to meet my wife.

1290
01:48:10,770 --> 01:48:11,759
Yes, tell me.

1291
01:48:13,172 --> 01:48:14,196

01:48:15,208 --> 01:48:16,368
Any other information?

1293
01:48:29,522 --> 01:48:31,615
We are already very disturbed.

1294
01:48:31,691 --> 01:48:33,181
We are worried for our son.

1295
01:48:33,259 --> 01:48:35,727
Please go away.

1296
01:48:35,795 --> 01:48:38,787
Watchman. Watchman.
Take them out of here.

Giving us a lot of trouble.

1298
01:48:44,737 --> 01:48:46,204
You have a phone in here?

1299
01:48:46,239 --> 01:48:48,434
The news is confirmed.

1300
01:48:48,741 --> 01:48:51,835
Malwankar last called from
a public booth in Vasai.

1301
01:48:52,478 --> 01:48:55,311
And Karan Chaudhary
just called his father..

1302
01:48:55,381 --> 01:48:56,678
asked him to come to
a church in Vasai.

1303
01:48:56,749 --> 01:48:58,046
Any contact from his dad?

1304
01:48:58,117 --> 01:48:59,516
No, his phone is off.

1305
01:49:00,453 --> 01:49:02,512
Leave. I'll meet you in Vasai.

1306
01:49:02,589 --> 01:49:04,113
Vasai.

01:50:26,305 --> 01:50:28,102
Amy, come, let's go from here.
- KC, have you got the money?

1325
01:50:00,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Www.mOVIEshareZ.coM

1326

01:50:31,778 --> 01:50:33,109
Where were you?
- Amy.. Amy..

1329
01:50:33,179 --> 01:50:34,305
I don't want to go home.

I have called my dad. I
have called my dad. - No.

He must be on his way
to pick us up. Come on.

1332
01:50:38,284 --> 01:50:39,615
You called him?
- No..

1333
01:50:39,752 --> 01:50:41,276
Amy, please. Come on, Amy.
- I don't..

1334
01:50:41,354 --> 01:50:42,514
With whose
permission did you call him?

1335
01:50:43,623 --> 01:50:45,818
Do I need your
permission to call my dad?

1336
01:50:46,092 --> 01:50:47,252
Amy. Amy, come on, let's go.

1337
01:50:47,293 --> 01:50:48,590
We were deciding
everything together, right?

1338
01:50:48,795 --> 01:50:51,059
What happened now?
- Now I have decided.

1339
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:53,064
Amy Let's go.

1340
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:54,325
No one will go anywhere.

1341
01:50:54,734 --> 01:50:57,168
Malwankar is not
answering his phone.

1342
01:50:58,604 --> 01:51:00,299
Enough of planning.

1343
01:51:00,773 --> 01:51:02,707
Until now it was
all your plan, right?

1344
01:51:03,276 --> 01:51:04,265
Is it working?

1345
01:51:05,578 --> 01:51:07,671
Whose plan was it
to kidnap oneself?

1346
01:51:09,115 --> 01:51:11,276
Whose plan was it to
hide in Bhindi Bazaar?

1347
01:51:11,751 --> 01:51:13,275
Whose plan was it to come here?

1348
01:51:13,753 --> 01:51:15,118
Amy, come on, let's go. Please.

1349
01:51:15,188 --> 01:51:17,019
Dash. Dash. Dash.

1350
01:51:17,090 --> 01:51:19,285
We can fix this, okay? I
know my dad. He loves me.

1351
01:51:19,358 --> 01:51:20,552
He loves me a lot, okay?

1352
01:51:20,626 --> 01:51:22,253
He must have paid up

1353
01:51:22,695 --> 01:51:24,287
Where have you hidden it?

1354
01:51:24,363 --> 01:51:26,729
Where have you hidden it?
- Just shut up, Amy.

1355
01:51:28,634 --> 01:51:30,761
Your dad hates you, okay?

1356
01:51:32,305 --> 01:51:36,264
Had he loved you he
would've quietly paid the money.

1357
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:42,304
And you..

1358
01:51:42,749 --> 01:51:45,411
You can leave if you want to.
She won't go anywhere.

1359
01:51:48,654 --> 01:51:50,053
Come on, Amy.

1360
01:51:57,330 --> 01:51:58,661
You will hit me?

1361
01:51:59,665 --> 01:52:00,689
Come on, Amy.
- No.

1362
01:52:00,767 --> 01:52:03,065
Let's go, Amy.
Let's get out of here.

1363
01:52:34,567 --> 01:52:36,467
It was my plan. My plan.

1364
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:11,001
Who is in there? Open
the door! Open the door!

1365
01:53:18,678 --> 01:53:20,407
People have gathered outside.
Come with me.

1366
01:53:21,113 --> 01:53:22,171
I have to go and get mom.

1367
01:53:24,317 --> 01:53:26,478
Amy, come with me.
- I have to get mom.

1368
01:53:30,289 --> 01:53:32,723
Amy.
- I have to go and get mom.

1369
01:53:32,792 --> 01:53:35,693
Your mother is dead. Do
you wish to die as well?

1370
01:53:35,761 --> 01:53:37,194
Come with me. Just get up.

1371
01:53:40,433 --> 01:53:43,061
No! She's not dead!
- Shut up.

1372
01:54:05,057 --> 01:54:06,718
Who is in there?

1373
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:08,554
Come on, run.

1374
01:54:08,661 --> 01:54:10,185
Move.

1375
01:56:18,157 --> 01:56:20,091
Amrita Jaishankar has been found.

1376
01:56:20,159 --> 01:56:24,152
The kidnappers of this
high profile kidnapping case..

1377
01:56:24,230 --> 01:56:27,097
..finally lost their
lives at God's abode.

1378
01:56:27,133 --> 01:56:31,092
Amrita bravely fought
with her kidnappers.

1379
01:56:31,170 --> 01:56:33,661
After a 48 hour ordeal

1380
01:56:33,739 --> 01:56:36,037
..the girl is now
safe with her parents.

1381
01:56:36,108 --> 01:56:39,737
Mathur, there is a difference
between the fact and the truth.

1382
01:56:41,747 --> 01:56:47,310
Mathur, the truth is its
the duty of every cop..

1383
01:56:47,386 --> 01:56:49,752
..to selflessly serve his nation.

1384
01:56:51,457 --> 01:56:55,393
But the fact remains
in a salary of 8500..

1385
01:56:56,529 --> 01:56:59,726
..he has to look after his family,
serve his nation..

1386
01:57:02,201 --> 01:57:08,572
..and be loyal,
selflessness goes for a toss.

1387
01:57:12,511 --> 01:57:18,609
One person is
responsible for all this.

1388
01:57:19,351 --> 01:57:20,784
Malwankar.

1389
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:22,685
It's true.

1390
01:57:23,355 --> 01:57:27,758
But the fact is to save the
face of the entire police force..

1391
01:57:29,695 --> 01:57:33,256
..this case has to be suppressed.

1392
01:57:34,433 --> 01:57:36,128
You've to decide..

1393
01:57:36,836 --> 01:57:42,331
..whether you will
go with truth or fact.

1394
01:57:53,752 --> 01:57:56,016
Amrita fought bravely
with her kidnappers..

1395
01:57:56,088 --> 01:57:58,352
..and just about managed to escape.

1396
01:57:58,557 --> 01:58:00,787
The other victims Tanya
Sharma and Zubin Shroff..

1397
01:58:01,060 --> 01:58:02,687
..are also in safe custody now.

1398
01:58:03,195 --> 01:58:04,492
While it was earlier reported that..

1399
01:58:04,563 --> 01:58:06,428
..one of her friends
Dushant Sahu might have been..

1400
01:58:06,499 --> 01:58:07,523
..involved in the kidnapping.

1401
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:09,363
At this point we
cannot confirm this.

1402
01:58:09,435 --> 01:58:11,062
I, Tanya Sharma.. I, Zubin Shroff..

1403
01:58:11,137 --> 01:58:14,334
In my sound mind, and
without any pressure from anyone..

1404
01:58:14,373 --> 01:58:17,706
..accept that we were not a part
of Amrita Jaishankar's kidnapping.

1405
01:58:18,344 --> 01:58:21,404
Like us, Karan Chaudhary
and Amrita Jaishankar, too..

1406
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:23,141
..became victims of this conspiracy.

1407
01:58:24,383 --> 01:58:27,614
This entire incident was
planned by Dushyant Sahu.

1408
01:58:27,753 --> 01:58:31,587
Wherever possible we tried our
best to stop our friend Dusyhant.

1409
01:58:32,491 --> 01:58:35,153
All four of us claim to be
innocent in this incident.

1410
01:58:35,227 --> 01:58:38,060
Yours' sincerely, Tanya.

1411
01:58:45,471 --> 01:58:48,133
Operation 'Amrita
Missing' has coming to an end.

1412
01:58:48,541 --> 01:58:51,237
During this case
Inspector Malwankar..

1413
01:58:51,343 --> 01:58:53,743
..who was investigating this case..

1414
01:58:54,013 --> 01:58:55,708
..has been seriously injured.

1415
01:58:56,515 --> 01:58:57,743
Malwankar..

1416
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:07,019
Look carefully at this bed,
this wall and this ward.

1417
01:59:09,094 --> 01:59:11,790
Because you will be
coming back here, soon.

1418
01:59:12,631 --> 01:59:14,394
Not because of what you have done.

1419
01:59:15,768 --> 01:59:18,293
But because I won't let
the years of hard work..

1420
01:59:18,370 --> 01:59:20,133
..of the police
force go down the drain.

1421
01:59:20,206 --> 01:59:22,231
I'm sorry, sir.

1422
01:59:22,808 --> 01:59:24,366
Sir. Sir..

1423
01:59:24,577 --> 01:59:25,635
Sir..

1424
01:59:26,345 --> 01:59:27,505
I am..

1425
01:59:41,627 --> 01:59:44,460
Mathur. Thanks a lot.

1426
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:49,294
Thanks.

1427
02:02:41,140 --> 02:02:43,040
What is your name, my child?

1428
02:02:46,478 --> 02:02:47,604
Saira.

1429
02:02:49,348 --> 02:02:51,111
Amy.

1430
02:02:53,218 --> 02:02:54,708
Saira Jaishankar.
