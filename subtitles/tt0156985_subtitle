1
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,200
THE ROAD

2
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,840
What's the fare?

3
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,600
Fifty rupees.

4
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,400
Sir, you gave me
100 rupees mistakenly.

5
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,680
OK!

6
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,040
Thank you.

7
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,960
Ravi, are you using
soda to freshen up?

8
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,480
Are you up for a
night shift again?

9
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,040
Why don't you take a break?

10
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,080
Driving round the
clock will kill you.

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,720
What can I do if I can't sleep?

12
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,960
Mumbai is full of
weirdos, no one sleeps!

13
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Mister, will you take me
to Kalapool Teenbatti?

14
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
Sure.

15
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,280
- One won't do.
- Take it, pal!

16
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,080
- Pakya!
- Hold on.

17
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,840
Why is everyone
huddled over there?

18
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,000
Ravi, we have a bride!

19
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,840
Bride?
I didn't see any bandwagon or procession!

20
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,000
So how come we have a bride?

21
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,400
- Gotya got married!
- What?

22
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,000
Here is my friend, Ravi! My pal!

23
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,160
Ravi!

24
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,560
I was looking for you.

25
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,240
- Congratulations!
- Come over here.

26
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,480
Thank you. What's up, Pakya?

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,200
So this is the bride?

28
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,400
Gotya, you haven't
got a place to stay.

29
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,640
Where will you keep her?

30
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,760
Pakya, ever since I was born,

31
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,840
I've spent my life on this
road and this pavement.

32
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,520
It has raised us so far.

33
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,280
- That's true.
- But now you have a wife.

34
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,960
So what?

35
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,360
God blessed me with a
bride, so He'll grant me a home.

36
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,440
- Isn't that right, Ravi?
- Right, pal!

37
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,840
We don't have a place to live.

38
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,360
Nor a bed to sleep.

39
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,000
We don't have a place to live.

40
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,480
Nor a bed to sleep.

41
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,160
But all we have is God.

42
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,480
So far He has raised us.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,440
We don't have a place to live.

44
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,040
Nor a bed to sleep.

45
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,440
We don't have a place to live.

46
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,760
Nor a bed to sleep.

47
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,480
But all we have is God.

48
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,120
So far God has raised us.

49
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,160
We spend our lives on pavements.

50
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,480
We can't dream of
mansions and luxury.

51
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,720
This road seems to
be like our guardian.

52
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,280
We are oblivious
to all relations.

53
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,800
All we have is this
dark night with us.

54
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,760
All we have is this
dark night with us.

55
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,400
We are deprived of all hopes.

56
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,880
So far God has raised us.

57
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,280
What kind of
nation do we live in?

58
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,480
Why do people
remember us after we die?

59
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,800
This is the world Where
the blind and deaf live.

60
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,400
Every one of them is helpless.

61
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,320
Who will pay us a heed?

62
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,120
But we will endure and live on.

63
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,800
We will drink.

64
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,280
But we will endure and live on.

65
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,120
We will drink.

66
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,320
This life is a goblet of venom.

67
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,840
So far God has raised us.

68
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,320
We don't have a place to live.

69
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,920
Nor a bed to sleep.

70
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,840
We don't have a place to live.

71
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,280
Nor a bed to sleep.

72
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,840
But all we have is God.

73
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,360
So far God has raised us.

74
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,840
But all we have is God.

75
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,840
So far God has raised us.

76
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,640
Congratulations, Gotya!

77
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,040
Gotya.

78
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,600
Why did your wife take off
her mangalsutra and vermilion?

79
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,160
Yes Ravi, it's true.
We are not married yet.

80
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,480
But we definitely
want to get married.

81
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,080
It's still an incomplete dream,

82
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,680
which we'll fulfill someday.

83
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,440
If you can pretend
to be married,

84
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,840
why don't you get married?

85
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,640
Tell me, Gotya!
What's your problem?

86
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,160
Tell me!

87
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,200
Get out.

88
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,240
Come on, tell me.
Why don't you speak?

89
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,440
Shall I tell you why?

90
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,360
Because she is a prostitute!

91
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,480
And those people will never
allow us to get married, Ravi!

92
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,640
I haven't got enough
money to buy her off!

93
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Gotya, why don't
you both run away?

94
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,000
It's not that easy, Ravi!

95
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,280
They are very powerful!

96
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,320
And it's also true I
am equally weak!

97
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,920
People say this
is a city of dreams.

98
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,520
Will our dreams ever come true?

99
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,760
Can a prostitute
ever get married?

100
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,240
Your dreams will be fulfilled.

101
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,760
My heart says so.

102
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,000
Your dreams will
be fulfilled for sure.

103
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,440
Gotya, let's go.

104
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,240
People say this
is a city of dreams.

105
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,280
Will our dreams ever come true?

106
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,000
Can a prostitute
ever get married?

107
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,160
Brother!

108
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,480
Save me.

109
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,560
Hey, girl, are you crazy?

110
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,120
Why are you standing in the
middle of the road at night?

111
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,320
My birds have
gone crazy, not me.

112
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,560
Look at them.
I let them go, but they just won't budge!

113
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,600
I know why they
don't want to leave.

114
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,760
Why is that?

115
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,200
Because this city
is very dangerous!

116
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,880
If they fly out, vultures
and hawks will eat them.

117
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,240
They will be killed.

118
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,040
So what should I do with them?

119
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
My uncle is going to
take me somewhere

120
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,840
and I can't take them along.

121
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,280
Give them to me.

122
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,840
Will you take care of them?

123
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,720
Sure.

124
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,960
- Properly?
- Yes.

125
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,040
Pooja, where are you?

126
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,760
Take this.

127
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,320
Do you know?

128
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,480
You're the first person in
this city I'm not scared of!

129
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,120
Hurry! Come on.

130
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,640
Let them get in!

131
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,200
Come in. Over there!

132
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,160
- What's up?
- We've been called.

133
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,360
- Who called you?
- Hey!

134
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,000
Hey, girl! Over there!

135
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,560
Sit down!

136
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,720
Open the gate. I want to go out.

137
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,120
Hey, come over here!

138
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,240
Sit down!

139
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,520
I go berserk when you look at me

140
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,760
I go berserk when
you look at me.

141
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,760
You drive me crazy, baby.

142
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,800
Nature is great! What a beauty!

143
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,520
Nature has done
wonders with you.

144
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,160
Look, I got goose bumps!

145
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,640
I almost had a heart attack.

146
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,320
So fair!

147
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,320
And look at her body!

148
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,400
Don't you be afraid of me, love!
Don't you be afraid!

149
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,840
I won't harm you!
I really can't harm you!

150
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,600
Do you know why?

151
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,200
Because I am a eunuch!

152
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,880
Just look at me!
I am just a poor, ugly creature.

153
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,840
Look at the cruel joke of fate!

154
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,880
All I have is brains.

155
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,680
And I can be so damn smart.

156
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,640
That's why I provide
services to men

157
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,320
and I force women to serve them!

158
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,520
King of this domain.

159
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,840
King of flesh trade!

160
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,680
And my name is Maharani!

161
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,880
What's going on, uncle?

162
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,080
- Let's get out of here.
- Let me tell you.

163
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,880
It's all fate.

164
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,920
We call it destiny!

165
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,560
Your dad and your uncle
have borrowed from me

166
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,240
for your grandpa's treatment.

167
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,880
And they kept you as a security.

168
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,280
Do you know about security?

169
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,080
Then say it loudly!
Why are you so shy?

170
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,840
But he couldn't even pay
me a dime for so many years!

171
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,480
So I brought Bansi's
daughter here!

172
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,640
Today, he has come here
to rescue his daughter.

173
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,280
What can he do?
He hasn't got a penny to repay me!

174
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,240
So he brought you here.

175
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,600
From now on, you'll stay here.

176
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,760
In this brothel.

177
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,160
Instead of his daughter.

178
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,680
No, uncle, you can't do that!

179
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,400
I am your niece.

180
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,480
This is all about relations!

181
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,440
When your neck is on the line,

182
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,800
you really don't
care about relations.

183
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,400
Poor Bansi hasn't
got a choice, has he?

184
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,680
You are his niece,
but she's his daughter.

185
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,840
He has taken the right
decision for his daughter.

186
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,680
Your fate has brought you here.

187
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,240
Nothing can be done now.
Nothing!

188
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,120
Got that?

189
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,480
I will make you
a high class slut!

190
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,040
I can guarantee you that.

191
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,240
Take me away from here!

192
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,320
Uncle, you can't
do this with me!

193
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,800
Please forgive me!

194
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,680
Forgive me!

195
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,000
- Forgive me!
- Don't create a scene!

196
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,920
Bansi! Get away from here!

197
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,080
Get going!

198
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,600
Come on.

199
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,240
Uncle!

200
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,080
Don't leave me here!

201
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,600
Crying won't help you.

202
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,880
Don't leave me here!

203
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,200
OK, OK.

204
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,200
- Juhu?
- Please get in.

205
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,000
Sir, a few days back, I saw
your photo in the newspaper.

206
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,240
You got an award.

207
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,520
Yes. You are right.

208
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,520
Your photo was in
The Times of India

209
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,640
and there was an article
about you in Illustrated Weekly.

210
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,560
Yes, sir.

211
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,880
It seems you are
an educated man.

212
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,880
So, why become a cabbie then?

213
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,280
It's a long story.

214
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,640
I am looking for someone.

215
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,680
May I help you?

216
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,480
So who are you looking for?

217
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,960
It's just a face. A hazy memory.

218
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,560
Not sure if I'll see
that person again.

219
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,640
Pull over.

220
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,440
- Here.
- No fare for you, sir.

221
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,840
- Keep it.
- No, sir.

222
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,760
OK.

223
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,440
If ever you need my
help, I live over here.

224
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,120
- See you.
- OK, sir.

225
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,720
Hi, Ravi!

226
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,480
Were you up all night?

227
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,440
Yes.
Just hold this cage for a while.

228
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,320
- David!
- Yes.

229
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,200
- Get a cup of tea upstairs.
- Sure. Right away!

230
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
Ravi!

231
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,680
Consume poison if
you want to die, not tea.

232
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,160
What's wrong, Salim?

233
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,160
You've been driving this
cab for the last 40 hours!

234
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,360
Do you wish to die?

235
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,160
What else will I do
to make a living?

236
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,640
Whenever I close my eyes,

237
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,200
all I remember is
that terrible incident!

238
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,360
Then I can't sleep.

239
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,120
Why don't you take medicine?
You're going to go crazy.

240
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,680
You'll need a shock treatment!
Got it?

241
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,960
I can't forget my sister.
I just can't, Salim.

242
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,120
What can I do?

243
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,520
I can see her every
moment of my life!

244
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,440
Ravi, it's been seven
years since she died.

245
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,880
You must get over it now.

246
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,000
You can't let memories
of the dead smother you.

247
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,680
- Right?
- Ravi!

248
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,680
Look what they have done to him.

249
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,080
What happened to him?

250
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,960
Last night three
goons beat him up

251
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,360
and drove off with his cab!

252
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,240
- Where did this happen?
- Near Colaba bus station.

253
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,320
Salim, take him to the hospital.
I'll be right back.

254
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,720
- Let's go, Pakya.
- Come on.

255
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,160
Come on.

256
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,400
Come on.

257
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,600
Smarty-pants, what
are you looking at?

258
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,960
Buzz off.

259
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,960
I want some stuff for my cab.

260
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Then go to a shop!
What are you doing here?

261
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,520
I want to buy a stolen one!

262
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,600
Are you a cop?

263
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,480
Pakya, he thinks I am a cop!

264
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,080
And does he think
I am a constable?

265
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,960
A cripple constable!

266
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,760
Come on!

267
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,560
Dude, you can get
everything in here!

268
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,200
- Really?
- Take your pick, buddy.

269
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,320
Sure.

270
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,600
How much for this one?

271
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,240
Tires are worth ten grand.

272
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,160
An engine will cost you eight.

273
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,480
The frame is about twelve grand.

274
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,960
So the whole comes out to 40.

275
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,640
For you, I will slash
it to thirty-eight!

276
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,840
Do you want it? Thirty-eight?

277
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
Ten!

278
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,440
Plus five is fifteen!

279
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,200
- And then five more.
- Hey, what are you up to?

280
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,400
Wait, don't disturb me
when I am counting!

281
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,240
Twenty.

282
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,400
And then thirty!

283
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,320
I want thirty-eight
thousand, OK?

284
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,760
What are you doing?

285
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,760
Thirty-eight thousand?

286
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,480
Boy, I don't have
that much money!

287
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,880
Jerk, what are you doing here?
Just get lost!

288
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,440
Can I suggest something?

289
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,760
I will take this cab for free.

290
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,480
Because this cab belongs
to someone I know.

291
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,880
Are you crazy or something?

292
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,640
- Are you crazy?
- Yes, I am crazy!

293
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,960
You wanna see? I am a punk!

294
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,480
Wanna see?

295
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,320
Don't move or
else I will shoot you!

296
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,360
Pakya!

297
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,280
- I will shoot you!
- Get the cab!

298
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,480
- I will shoot you!
- Shut up!

299
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,360
- Get the cab!
- I will shoot you!

300
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,520
- He can't do it! Get the cab!
- I will do it!

301
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,160
- Get the cab!
- Don't do it! I will shoot him!

302
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,200
He will kill you!

303
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,240
- I will shoot you!
- Will you?

304
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,160
- Yes, I will shoot you!
- Then shoot me!

305
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
- You want to shoot me? Go ahead.
- Yes!

306
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,360
Come on, shoot me! Come on.

307
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,240
You beat him up, didn't you?

308
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,040
You beat him up, didn't you?

309
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,200
No, Ravi! Stop it!

310
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,640
God knows why you
were born in our family!

311
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
I will beat you up!

312
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,880
Rupa is not in the room!

313
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,840
- I think she ran away!
- Take off your shoes!

314
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,120
Grandpa! Grandpa!

315
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,400
It's a telegram!

316
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,640
We found her after two years.

317
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,160
She is in Mumbai, grandpa.
And she is in a hospital.

318
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,280
Let's go to Mumbai
and bring her back.

319
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,880
- Right?
- OK.

320
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,440
Where is ward number 13?

321
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,320
This way.

322
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,120
I will kill you!

323
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,400
You can't keep me in here!

324
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,960
I am getting out of here!

325
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,080
No! No!

326
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:03,000
I am getting out of here!

327
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,480
- I'm leaving.
- Rupa!

328
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,280
Rupa!

329
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,800
No! No!

330
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,360
- Please take me away from here!
- Rupa!

331
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
Rupa!

332
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,600
Rupa, I am Ravi.

333
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,800
Your brother, Ravi.

334
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,920
- Ravi!
- Yes.

335
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,600
Ravi!

336
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,520
Don't touch me, Ravi.

337
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,600
I have sinned! I have sinned!

338
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,760
No, Rupa, don't say that.

339
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,560
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine.

340
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,480
It will be fine!

341
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,160
Everything will be fine!

342
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,480
- How do you feel now?
- I am fine now.

343
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,040
Brother, will you take
me away from here?

344
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,840
Brother, I am really scared.

345
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,280
Please take me away from here.

346
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,040
I want to go back home.

347
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,400
Brother, please!

348
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,080
Yes, we are here
to take you back.

349
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,960
Grandpa, please forgive me.

350
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,480
I know I made a mistake, but...

351
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,640
I want to come back home.

352
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,000
Please take me home.

353
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,600
Yes?

354
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,280
Can you tell me where can I find Ms.
Rupa?

355
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,800
- Ms. Rupa?
- Yes.

356
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,520
She is right there,
bed number two.

357
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,400
Thank you, sister.

358
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,080
What's wrong?

359
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,440
That woman...

360
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,800
She won't let me go home.

361
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,200
She will take me back!

362
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,200
- Please ask her to leave!
- OK.

363
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,240
Don't you leave me!

364
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,160
Please ask her to leave!

365
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,200
Please!

366
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,280
Let's get away from here!

367
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,800
- No, brother!
- Grandpa!

368
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,920
Grandpa, what's going on?

369
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,280
Come outside, I will tell you.

370
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,280
Grandpa!

371
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,600
Listen to me, grandpa! Brother!

372
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,560
Come on, son!

373
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,040
Where are you taking me?

374
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,880
She is not Rupa anymore!
She has sinned!

375
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,880
That woman has
told me everything.

376
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,800
She was in that brothel
for two long years!

377
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,080
She eloped with a man
and he sold her to a brothel!

378
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,640
She doesn't exist for us now!

379
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,440
She's infested with a disease!

380
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,320
She has sinned!

381
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,840
No, grandpa! She is my sister!
My elder sister!

382
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,200
She belongs to our family!

383
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,280
We can't leave unless
we take her with us!

384
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,760
Just come with me!

385
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,080
Our family has
been a priest's family

386
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,480
for the last three generations!

387
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,480
Our entire village swears by

388
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,920
our religious sanctity
and our virtues!

389
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,800
People worship God,
but they respect our family!

390
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,600
How can I take this
sinner to that village?

391
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,840
No! She chose a path to hell.

392
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,040
Come, we will go home
and perform last rites.

393
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,200
To hell with your
religion and your customs!

394
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,480
I don't want any of this!

395
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,920
You wanted to
perform last rites for her!

396
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Why don't you do it for me, too?

397
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,840
I am going back up there.

398
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,080
- To my sister!
- Brother!

399
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,720
Brother, please save me!

400
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,520
- Rupa!
- Brother! Help!

401
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,360
No!

402
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,120
Rupa!

403
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,680
Rupa! No!

404
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,240
Ravi!

405
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,640
- Ravi.
- No!

406
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,520
- Rupa!
- Hey, Ravi.

407
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,280
- Uncle Salim!
- Ravi!

408
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,040
Uncle, Rupa!

409
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,640
I can't... Rupa!

410
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,280
Mr. Salim, get this medication

411
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,080
and sign this form.

412
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,640
He must be admitted right away.

413
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,000
But why?

414
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,120
We must give him
electric therapy!

415
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,960
I will chop off my
hand before signing

416
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,480
this death warrant
for my friend!

417
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,040
It's pretty normal
treatment for such a patient.

418
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,760
Maybe it's normal for you,
but my friend is special to me.

419
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,560
So what are you going to do?

420
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,120
Who am I to turn to about this?

421
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,920
I'm turning to Him.
The Almighty.

422
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,480
He gave him this pain.
He can take it away.

423
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,760
There must be someone
who will ease his pain.

424
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,640
Hold on.

425
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,040
Why are you crying?
Don't create a scene.

426
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,400
Do it properly. No clumsy jobs.

427
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,600
Don't you cry, girl! I warn you!

428
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,280
Crying is futile.
Your fate is sealed now.

429
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,520
Arrange the garland.

430
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,160
If crying could
change my destiny,

431
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,840
wouldn't you see
me crying all day?

432
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,160
Are you done? Back off now!

433
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,720
I cried a lot when people
called me gay, a eunuch.

434
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,760
But I was destined to become a eunuch.
So I became one.

435
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,320
And you are destined to become
a slut, so get ready to be one.

436
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,600
And you will make it to the top.
Trust me.

437
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,560
Oh, macho man,
hold this properly.

438
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,440
You will regret if
you don't listen to me.

439
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,080
Don't play with your fate.

440
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,520
Just look at her.
Her face looks haggard due to crying.

441
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,880
Hey, don't you cry!

442
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,360
Who will buy you if
your face looks like that?

443
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,800
Who is going to bid for you?

444
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,080
Don't you cry.

445
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,800
Get ready for next
full moon night.

446
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,400
You have no idea
how beautiful you are.

447
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,160
You are gonna set
fire to this market.

448
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,880
Ravi, why don't you speak up

449
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,480
instead of sitting
with a gloomy face?

450
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,440
What's wrong with you?
I don't get this at all.

451
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,360
- Salim! Salim.
- Yes?

452
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,160
I have an idea.

453
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,720
- What is it?
- Let's get him married.

454
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,760
If his wife will pester
him, he'll have to talk.

455
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,760
Here comes Gotya.

456
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,560
- Come here. Listen to me.
- What is it?

457
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,040
Do you know anyone?
We should get him married.

458
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,120
Forget about it!

459
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,000
If he is destined
to get married,

460
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,840
she'll appear out of nowhere.

461
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,360
God has already
decided everyone's fate.

462
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,200
Ravi, come on, drop me at Chanda's place.
Come on.

463
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,080
No, Gotya, get some another cab.

464
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,880
Come on, pal.
You'll go crazy if you sit here like this.

465
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,920
Come with me,
let's do something!

466
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,000
I have to pay cab
fare in any case.

467
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,960
Right?

468
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,440
Why wouldn't I pay my friend?

469
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,120
- Isn't that right?
- Absolutely!

470
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,560
- Perfect!
- Am I right?

471
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,560
Come on!

472
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,520
Come on, pal! Come on!

473
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,240
Ravi, I will be back soon.

474
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,760
Get her! Don't let her escape!

475
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,440
Get her!

476
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,800
Save me! Take me from here!

477
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,760
Save me!

478
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,000
Come on, get out of there!

479
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,360
Come on!

480
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,240
Take her upstairs!

481
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,920
- Come on!
- Hey! Wait!

482
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,520
Why are you forcing her
if she doesn't want to go?

483
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,960
Mind your own business!

484
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,280
- I am going to whack you!
- Keep out of this.

485
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,480
Take your friend!

486
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,240
- Get him out of here!
- Yes!

487
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,440
- Don't try to act smart!
- Ravi, no.

488
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,280
Just get lost! Come on.
Back off, Ravi!

489
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,080
Ravi, come on!
Don't mess with them!

490
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,560
Get back to your work! Get lost!

491
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,320
You are the first person in
this city I am not scared of!

492
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,040
Take me away from here!

493
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,200
Save me!

494
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,120
For the first time in seven
years, you spoke about a girl

495
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,720
who is alive instead of
talking about your dead sister.

496
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,120
I think you're on
the right track.

497
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,600
Salim, that innocent
face still haunts me.

498
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,320
And she is calling me!

499
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,320
She wants my help.

500
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,960
How much do I have?

501
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,480
You've stashed 30 grand
over the last seven years.

502
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,120
Give it to me.
I will rescue her today.

503
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,120
So you'll blow all
your money on her?

504
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,400
Ravi, let me tell
you about love.

505
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,760
Once you're
engulfed by this fire,

506
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,680
it just grows with
each passing day.

507
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,240
And it can never be put off!

508
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,720
Gotya, I had a run-in
with those guys.

509
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,400
What if they recognize me?

510
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,680
Don't talk rubbish.

511
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,440
That place is filled with
drunkards and peddlers!

512
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,760
They wouldn't realize if their
own father passed by them!

513
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,920
So they won't recognize you.
Don't worry!

514
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,440
You know what? Just keep quiet.

515
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,280
And let me do the talking.

516
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,840
And the rest will
be handled by Gullu.

517
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,560
Gullu? Who is he?

518
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,440
Are you nuts, Gotya?

519
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,320
You want me to take away
a girl from Maharani's den?

520
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,720
You have no idea.
This is no cakewalk!

521
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,080
I know everything, Gullu.
But you have to do this anyhow!

522
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,920
But how will I do it? How?

523
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,760
Listen, mister, this is
where I earn my living.

524
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,960
If she doesn't come
back, I'll be out of business.

525
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,440
Do you know the consequences?

526
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,520
Why don't you think beyond that?

527
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,680
You are a pimp!

528
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,640
How are you going
to answer to God?

529
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,760
What will happen when
your sins will be counted?

530
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,800
Why don't you do at
least one good deed?

531
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,360
Watchdog!

532
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,400
Will you keep it locked,
because you are guarding it?

533
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,640
Smoky!
Don't you see that I've got new customers?

534
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,840
Come on, jerk, let us in now!

535
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,480
Bholu! Let them in!

536
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,240
Idiot! Come, sir!

537
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,000
Come on in, Gotya!

538
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,280
Why do you need
a pimp to visit us?

539
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,600
Come in!

540
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,840
- Look, I have brought my friend in here.
- Really?

541
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,920
He is shy as he is new here.

542
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
- Sit down!
- Sit down!

543
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,120
He's back from abroad.
Got a truckload of money.

544
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,960
That's why I brought him here.

545
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,600
This place means
satisfaction guaranteed!

546
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,720
My guarantee!

547
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,040
That's fine.
But where are the girls?

548
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,680
Why not? Sure.

549
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,080
Come on, get them out here.

550
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,000
Sir, just turn around.

551
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,320
I want that girl.

552
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,600
What an amazing customer!

553
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
He wants the girl who
will be auctioned today.

554
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,120
Why did you bring her out?

555
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,680
She has already been sold.

556
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,480
He has put in a bid of ten grand for her!
Take her away!

557
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,960
No! I bid twelve grand!

558
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,680
Didn't I tell you
she's been sold?

559
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,720
Find some other girl!

560
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,600
Just look there!
She is good, isn't she?

561
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,680
Two grand can't buy my honor.

562
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,640
- Fifteen thousand!
- Fifteen?

563
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,760
Did you see that?

564
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,840
Did you see?

565
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,240
She is getting
the right price now!

566
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,200
That's why I say
that without a pimp,

567
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,960
you can't make much profit!

568
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,880
Even I am willing
to pay fifteen grand!

569
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,200
Twenty grand!

570
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,880
It's a matter of ego now.
I'm not backing off! Thirty grand!

571
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,480
OK, here is your
thirty thousand.

572
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,840
And I got two more! Thirty-two!

573
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,640
Here's thirty-five thousand!

574
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,640
Thirty-five!
That's more like it!

575
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,120
Now the girl will go
to the highest bidder.

576
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,120
Both of them have
emptied their coffers!

577
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,480
Pal, why don't you
come tomorrow?

578
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,240
What difference
does a night make?

579
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,080
Tomorrow she'll be much cheaper!

580
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,840
No! No!

581
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,240
I will come back
with more money!

582
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,760
But that girl will go with me.

583
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,080
Listen, sir, this
trade runs on time.

584
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,960
First come, first served.
That's it!

585
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,320
Night and this trade
stop for no one.

586
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,360
Get lost if you haven't
got more money.

587
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,440
- Come on, sir. Hurry up.
- Wait.

588
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,600
- Here.
- A single bill won't do. Take out a wad.

589
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,640
Just a minute, sir.

590
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,120
- Here it is.
- Give it to him.

591
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,640
Give it.

592
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,120
Take this.
And now this girl belongs to me.

593
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,320
Hey, wait, why
are you so excited?

594
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,400
So have you got more than him?

595
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,000
This is wrong, Maharani!
You had cut a deal with me!

596
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,360
This is inhuman!
You have cheated me.

597
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,080
Get lost.

598
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,000
Do you think pimps
and sluts are humans?

599
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,800
Trying to teach
me about humanity?

600
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,800
Take this!

601
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,760
Just go and continue
with your corrupt business!

602
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,160
Don't lecture us about honesty!
Get lost!

603
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,800
Excuse me, sir.

604
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,320
Have a blast tonight.

605
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,080
Go easy on her.
She is a new girl.

606
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,840
Girls, get back to your work!
Get back!

607
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,880
- Go back there.
- Where are you going?

608
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,600
- Stop! Just wait there!
- Leave her!

609
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,040
- Leave her!
- Chanda, leave!

610
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,440
Go on, my boy.

611
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,000
Are you blushing?
Move it, pal! Go on!

612
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,680
Look, she is eagerly
waiting for you!

613
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,400
Take them to a room.

614
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,880
Come on, pal.

615
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,880
What's wrong?

616
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,240
Can I take her out?

617
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,680
Why not? Sure!

618
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,360
You have paid for her.
You can take her anywhere.

619
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,800
But where will you go?
Which hotel?

620
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,400
Citizen hotel!
We've already booked the room.

621
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,600
- At Karim's place?
- Yes!

622
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,240
I know him pretty well.

623
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,440
Come on, go!

624
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,880
Listen, girl, he is going
to be your man for tonight!

625
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,680
Make him happy.

626
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,120
Don't create a scene.
Is that clear?

627
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,520
Come on, take her!

628
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,720
Oh, please move.

629
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,960
Come on, don't be shy like a kid.
Go!

630
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,280
And give her some fancy name.

631
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,320
Gotya, where are you going, pal?

632
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,240
Why don't you wait here
for tonight with Chanda?

633
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,200
No, boss. I would rather leave.

634
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,600
I've never spent a night
with Chanda at your place.

635
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,720
But today, you got to stay here.

636
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,920
Till your friend
returns with that girl,

637
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,280
you'll stay with us.

638
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,840
Gotya, don't feel bad.
It's strictly business!

639
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,560
She is new and
so is this fellow.

640
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,720
Who knows if
they'll ever return?

641
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,840
So you'll be here as our security deposit.
Till tomorrow.

642
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,440
You can leave!
But be here by morning, OK?

643
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,320
Or else we have
your friend with us!

644
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,120
Bye!

645
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,280
Come on, Gotya.

646
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,280
Chanda! Chanda!

647
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,040
Take Gotya inside.

648
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,840
I didn't guess you
came to save me.

649
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,480
Are they still alive?

650
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,760
How could I let them die?

651
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,400
Keep them with you for tonight.

652
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,680
There is going to be
night every day, Ravi!

653
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,240
I will make sure I
will be always there.

654
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,520
For how long?

655
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,480
Till the day you'll be free!

656
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,200
Now tell me, where will you go?

657
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,520
To the temple.

658
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,880
I feel I should ask
something from God.

659
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:07,200
I have sworn.

660
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,480
To make you mine.

661
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,600
I have sworn.

662
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,640
To make you mine.

663
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:29,520
Your eyes gleam.

664
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,360
With only love.

665
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,840
I have sworn

666
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,840
to make you mine.

667
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,200
I will let everyone know.

668
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,800
What love really is.

669
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,240
I will let everyone know.

670
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,240
What love really is

671
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,880
I will vanquish.

672
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,680
Everyone for you.

673
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,880
Your love.

674
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,120
Has made me crazy.

675
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:54,920
Your love.

676
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,080
Has made me crazy.

677
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:06,200
I have sworn

678
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,080
to make you mine.

679
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,880
I want to steal.

680
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,640
The dew from your lips.

681
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,800
I want to steal.

682
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,160
The dew from your lips

683
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,520
I want to.

684
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,720
Spend my life with you.

685
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:59,240
Your intoxicating love.

686
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,000
Runs through my blood.

687
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:10,160
Your intoxicating love.

688
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,680
Runs through my blood.

689
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,640
I have sworn.

690
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,720
To make you mine.

691
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,040
Your arms.

692
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,880
Hold the world for me.

693
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,080
Your arms.

694
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,280
Hold the world for me

695
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:04,280
I am nothing without you.

696
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,480
I have a world of happiness.

697
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,360
As I have found you.

698
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:21,320
I have a world of happiness.

699
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,960
As I have found you.

700
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:32,560
I have sworn.

701
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,720
To make you mine.

702
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:43,840
Your eyes gleam.

703
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,400
With only love.

704
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:55,080
I have sworn.

705
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:59,200
To make you mine.

706
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,440
Pooja, I would have never
left you there, but for Gotya.

707
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:14,080
Ravi, you gave me so
much respect in a night

708
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,880
I don't care if I die now.

709
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,360
Pooja, I won't let
anything happen to you.

710
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,000
I need you.

711
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,440
Tonight I'll rescue
you from there.

712
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,360
I don't care about
the consequences.

713
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,640
Ravi, this is total madness!

714
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,400
Salim, come on,
make him understand.

715
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,600
Today he mortgaged his
cab and got the money.

716
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,520
He'll pay it back
and save her tonight!

717
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,160
Maybe day after tomorrow!
Or after that!

718
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,120
How long will you
continue to save her?

719
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,720
I just want to save her.
That's it!

720
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,600
I don't care if I'll
have to sell myself.

721
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,720
- Got that?
- Did you hear that?

722
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,040
Did you hear what he said?

723
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,960
- Let me go!
- Come on!

724
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,240
- Let me go!
- Come on!

725
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,720
Didn't I tell you that I
don't want to go with you?

726
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,080
Don't force me!

727
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,760
What if I am a prostitute?
I still have feelings.

728
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,680
- I don't want to be with him!
- Come on!

729
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,160
- Let me go!
- Don't act too smart!

730
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,560
- Let me go!
- Come on!

731
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,480
Let me go!

732
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,120
What is it?

733
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,080
To whom are you signaling?

734
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,000
Don't push him!
He is our customer!

735
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,200
And customers should
not be pushed, pal!

736
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,360
Get away, you pimp!

737
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,160
What are you doing here?

738
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,160
Go and find more customers!

739
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,000
How can you call me a pimp?
You called me a pimp?

740
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,440
Shall I tell you what you are?
Shall I?

741
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,600
What's up? What's going on?

742
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,080
What are you calling him?
Come over here! Come on!

743
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,480
Come on!

744
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,280
Now tell me.
Tell me, what is it?

745
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,840
Tell me, what is it?

746
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,120
Rascal!

747
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,680
I might not be fully a man...

748
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,160
But I can take down
five men like you!

749
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,720
Tell me, why are you here?
Tell me!

750
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,920
I brought that guy again!

751
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,200
And he is back
with a lot of money!

752
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,800
So are you back again?

753
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,600
What will you do with this girl?

754
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,680
Just play around?

755
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,640
Just tell me the price!

756
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,280
I will do what I want.
None of your business.

757
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,920
That's definitely my business!

758
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,040
I just don't sit around!
I've been here for thirty years!

759
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,600
This morning, when
you brought her back

760
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,520
I looked at her and I realized

761
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,440
that you didn't sleep
with her last night.

762
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,720
Look, I am paying you
more than last night!

763
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,640
I see.

764
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,120
If you want, my
friend will stay over!

765
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,320
But tonight, she will go with me.
Got that?

766
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,360
I am running this
brothel for everyone!

767
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,960
We got so many customers
and it's my job to please everyone.

768
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,160
But a jerk like you comes
over once in a blue moon,

769
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,320
who pays thirty grand but
doesn't sleep with a girl.

770
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,840
Either you are
crazy or you love her!

771
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,080
And both the facts
are dangerous for us!

772
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,880
Go find some other brothel.
Get lost!

773
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,560
Or you can take another girl.

774
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,760
I will let you go
with Chanda for free!

775
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,920
She is very close to
your friend, isn't she?

776
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,040
- Just take her out!
- No!

777
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,000
I only want her!

778
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:15,040
Oh, I am sick of you!

779
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,960
What kind of man are you?

780
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,160
Hey, throw him out!

781
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,160
- Hurry up!
- Come on!

782
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,400
- Hurry up!
- Get lost!

783
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,400
What are you looking at?

784
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,920
Hey!

785
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,160
What are you up to?

786
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,960
- Don't beat him! Don't beat him!
- Get lost!

787
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,760
- Hey, don't touch him!
- Get lost, you pimp!

788
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,360
Are you crazy?

789
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:25,560
Whenever you
tried to stop lovers.

790
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,520
Love has deepened.

791
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:35,400
It has deepened

792
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:40,440
even more.

793
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,600
Whenever the world.

794
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:52,600
Has stopped lovers from meeting.

795
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:58,440
Their love has
deepened even more.

796
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:03,000
Their love deepens even more.

797
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,080
No matter what the world does.

798
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,440
You can't stop it.

799
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:15,720
Their love deepens even more.

800
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,800
Whenever the world Has
stopped lovers from meeting.

801
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,960
Can't stop clouds from raining.

802
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,520
Can't stop lightening either.

803
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,760
No one can stop these.

804
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:05,640
No one can stop these.

805
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,640
The fragrance of the flowers.

806
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,600
And the cuckoo from singing.

807
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:16,280
No one can stop them.

808
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,320
No one can stop them.

809
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,400
Whenever the world will create.

810
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,520
Whenever the world.

811
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,800
Raises a wall between lovers.

812
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,880
Their love will
deepen even more.

813
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:46,400
Their love will
deepen even more.

814
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,640
Whenever the world Has
stopped lovers from meeting.

815
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,440
The memories in my heart.

816
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,240
The promises of my beloved.

817
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,520
Nobody can tie them with chains.

818
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:36,120
Nobody can tie them with chains.

819
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:43,320
The treasure of
love and feelings.

820
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,680
Nobody can buy them with wealth.

821
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,040
Nobody can buy them with wealth.

822
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,880
Whenever this cruel world.

823
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,080
Whenever this cruel world.

824
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,040
Buries lovers alive.

825
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:11,480
Their love will
deepen even more.

826
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:17,080
Their love will
deepen even more.

827
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:23,440
Whenever the world Has
stopped lovers from meeting.

828
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,960
Their love has deepened.

829
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,360
Deepened.

830
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,280
Deepened.

831
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,280
Deepened even more.

832
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:43,440
When two lovers.

833
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:49,320
When two lovers are
made restless by the world.

834
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:55,080
Their love has
deepened even more.

835
00:58:55,160 --> 00:59:00,320
Their love has
deepened even more.

836
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:06,360
No matter what the world
does You can't stop it.

837
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:12,040
Their love has
deepened even more.

838
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:17,680
Whenever the world Has
stopped lovers from meeting.

839
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,520
Why are you so shy? Come on!

840
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,360
Come on, don't be shy!

841
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,800
Do come tomorrow!

842
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,560
I will allow you only
on one condition.

843
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:04,600
That you deflower
her right in front of me!

844
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,000
Tell me, do you agree?

845
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,400
Are you shy because of me?

846
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,240
You know what am I?

847
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,600
So, tell me, do you agree?

848
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,080
Yes, I agree!

849
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,440
Yes?

850
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,440
Come. Come in!

851
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,080
Let's go!

852
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,920
Maharani, just as
this is her first time,

853
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,440
it's mine, as well.

854
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,000
So what's the matter?
Hold her! What's the big deal?

855
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,280
I want to ask you
something about deflowering.

856
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,200
- What is it?
- Come here.

857
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,240
Why should I come there?
You hold her. I will watch from here.

858
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,560
Come here for a minute.

859
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,080
OK, here I come.

860
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,880
So tell me.

861
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,400
Well, I...

862
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,800
"Well, I..." What is it?

863
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,040
I want to...

864
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,200
- Are you feeling shy?
- Yes.

865
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,560
You can whisper it in my ears.
Tell me.

866
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,000
Come on, Pooja!

867
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,400
Back off! Back off!

868
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,080
Open the door.
Or I will slit his throat!

869
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,120
Open the door! Open it!

870
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,640
Pooja, run!

871
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,080
Gotya, run!

872
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,560
Gotya! Run!

873
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,440
Chanda, come on!

874
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:57,920
Gullu, run!

875
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,560
Come on, Gotya! Come on!

876
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,160
Get in the car, Ravi! Hurry up!

877
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,360
- Is she all right?
- She has bled a lot!

878
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,920
Take her to the hospital.

879
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,920
No!

880
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,760
Let me bleed!

881
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,440
Let me writhe in pain!

882
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:00,880
Maharani!

883
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:06,720
This blood flow,
and this intense pain

884
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,280
will constantly remind me

885
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:13,640
that that scoundrel...

886
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,240
has taken away a girl

887
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,840
from Maharani's den!

888
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,240
Maharani!

889
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,440
Now this wound
will continue to bleed

890
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,720
till I find that girl.

891
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,800
I swear on my turf,

892
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,560
if I don't bury
that fellow here,

893
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,680
I'll change my
name from Maharani.

894
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,520
Gotya!

895
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:17,920
Gotya!

896
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,400
Where is he?

897
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:22,920
Gotya!

898
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,960
Gotya!

899
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,120
I saw you and my heart danced.

900
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:03,920
The desire to live has awoken.

901
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:11,760
The desire to live till doomsday
Has awoken in my heart.

902
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:20,280
I saw you and my heart danced.

903
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:28,400
The desire to live has awoken.

904
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:34,640
The desire to live till doomsday
Has awoken in my heart.

905
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:28,920
Never seen such a
beautiful ambiance.

906
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,840
And this magic is incomparable.

907
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:39,680
Nobody has loved
me this way before.

908
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:44,440
And I didn't love
anyone this way either.

909
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:48,160
This happiness is here to stay.

910
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,600
We are devoid of all sorrow.

911
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,520
I feel like flying away.

912
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,640
And touching the sky.

913
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,440
The desire to live has awoken.

914
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:11,520
The desire to live till doomsday
Has awoken in my heart.

915
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,440
I saw you and my heart danced.

916
01:07:55,360 --> 01:08:00,400
My life has changed.

917
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:05,440
And I feel like living again.

918
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:11,160
Everything feels so changed.

919
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:16,240
Even I am changing too.

920
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,760
My dream has been fulfilled

921
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,960
I've met my loved one.

922
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,480
Between the sanctum of clouds.

923
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,680
We are ready to live.

924
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:35,680
The desire to live has awoken.

925
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:43,680
The desire to live till doomsday
Has awoken in my heart.

926
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,120
I saw you and my heart danced.

927
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:59,240
The desire to live has awoken.

928
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:07,080
The desire to live till doomsday
Has awoken in my heart.

929
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,600
May God bless them!

930
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,920
At least I have done
one good deed in my life.

931
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,320
The strap has come loose.
Never mind.

932
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,040
What's going to happen to me?

933
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:32,120
I can't go back to Maharani.

934
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,640
She might kill me!

935
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,680
I really messed up with her!

936
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,760
Get him!

937
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,840
Save me!

938
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:48,080
- Somebody save me!
- Get him!

939
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,200
Beloved doesn't agree with me.

940
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:55,000
Beloved doesn't agree with me.

941
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:59,000
Beloved doesn't agree with me.

942
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,880
Beloved doesn't agree with me.

943
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,920
Beloved doesn't agree with me.

944
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Uncle Kareem, save me!

945
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,040
Suleiman! Uncle Kareem!

946
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,080
Somebody save me!

947
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,960
They will kill me!

948
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,360
No!

949
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,680
Maharani, please forgive me.

950
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,240
I was wrong.
I won't do it again!

951
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:27,880
I know God punishes
everyone right here.

952
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,640
Where will a pimp like me go?

953
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,840
I am going to die here!

954
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,720
But how will you kill me?

955
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,400
Come on!
So kill me now! Hurry up!

956
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:43,720
- Kill me! Don't make me wait!
- Gullu!

957
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,880
Gullu, it's not your fault.

958
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,680
The fault must be in your legs.

959
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,680
You ran away from me, right?

960
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,360
- Break his legs!
- No!

961
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:00,840
Play!

962
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,920
Beloved doesn't agree with me.

963
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,240
Uncle Kareem!

964
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,840
Please save me!

965
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,920
Don't break my legs!

966
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:12,680
Beloved doesn't agree with me.

967
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,800
Beloved doesn't agree with me.

968
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,000
Louder!

969
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,520
Beloved doesn't agree with me.

970
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,520
Beloved doesn't agree with me.

971
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,120
Brother, have some more.

972
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,320
No, not for me.

973
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,560
Give it to Gotya.

974
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,240
After all he is married, not me.

975
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,000
No, he is just joking!

976
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,200
Do you intend to kill
me by overeating?

977
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,080
We are just married.

978
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:41,080
At least let me enjoy
it for a few days!

979
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,800
What do you say, Salim?
Am I right?

980
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,560
Please have it.

981
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,360
- Sister-in-law!
- Enough.

982
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,960
- Sister-in-law!
- Tell me.

983
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,520
Please take these girls
to your mother-in-law.

984
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,920
- I want to have a word with Salim.
- OK.

985
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,040
Please come with me. Please!

986
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:09,400
Come on, kids.

987
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:15,840
What are you thinking about?

988
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,760
At least let me think
since you are not.

989
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,360
How long will you keep
running away from them?

990
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,520
How long?

991
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,280
Today, they came to
my hotel looking for you.

992
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,560
Pakya told me this.

993
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,480
Tomorrow, they might come here.

994
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,640
How long will you
hide from them?

995
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,120
- Answer me!
- Salim is absolutely right!

996
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,920
I didn't tell you, but
they had gone to my den.

997
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,240
They ransacked it!
Now I am out of business!

998
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,040
What should I do?
Tell me, what should I do?

999
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,200
Shall I take her there again?

1000
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,360
Why don't you all understand?

1001
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,600
I love her!

1002
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,280
Didn't I tell you not to
take her there again?

1003
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,080
Didn't I tell you
not to love her?

1004
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:56,480
All I am saying is that
we must go to police.

1005
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,120
Let's get their help.

1006
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,320
Do you know someone
who can help us?

1007
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,680
Yes, I do.

1008
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,120
I hope you didn't tell
anyone about this.

1009
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,640
No, sir, we didn't.

1010
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:17,200
We didn't want to
tell anyone about this.

1011
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,040
That's why we decided
to meet you personally.

1012
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,880
Sir, please tell us
what we should do.

1013
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,640
We know it's difficult
for us to get rid of them!

1014
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,360
And it also concerns the
lives of two innocent girls.

1015
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,440
Where are those girls now?

1016
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,520
They are staying
at our friend's house.

1017
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,240
But we can't keep
them there much longer.

1018
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,800
Those girls must give
me a written statement.

1019
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,880
Only then can a case be filed.

1020
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,960
I can't arrest them unless
and until a case is filed.

1021
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:52,320
These prostitution
racketeers are pretty powerful.

1022
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,360
We must be absolutely careful.

1023
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,320
I have a suggestion.

1024
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,560
Bring those girls to
Satyam Car Park at 4 p.m.

1025
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:07,080
I will record their statement,
then a case will be filed.

1026
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,440
Then you'll get
police protection.

1027
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:38,920
Maharani!

1028
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,040
Gotya, run!

1029
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:57,480
You can run but you can't hide.

1030
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:04,200
You are a mouse and I
am a cat Run here I come.

1031
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,200
The cat cried meow.

1032
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,840
The cat cried meow.

1033
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,400
Why are you scared of me?

1034
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,640
I am here just to hug.

1035
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,960
And give you some love.

1036
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,440
Pooja, calm down.

1037
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,080
Pooja.

1038
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,480
Gotya, run!

1039
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,040
Run!

1040
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:32,680
No.

1041
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,560
Chanda! Gotya!

1042
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:39,520
Gotya!

1043
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,280
No, Gotya!

1044
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,000
Ravi, go away! Save Pooja.

1045
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,680
- Gotya.
- Save Pooja, Ravi!

1046
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,960
Gotya!

1047
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,320
So, Gotya?

1048
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,800
Does it hurt?

1049
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:16,840
It hurts?

1050
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,840
Let me show you.

1051
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,080
Kill me, Maharani!

1052
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,360
Bye!

1053
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,320
Hello, Lalwadi Police Station?

1054
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:45,440
Inspector, you have
betrayed your profession!

1055
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,520
You are unworthy of
the medal given to you!

1056
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,840
But you have to remember
one thing, Inspector!

1057
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,160
I will come back!

1058
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,520
I will hide her somewhere
and I will be back for revenge!

1059
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:03,840
Soon your photo will be in
the papers for the last time.

1060
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,800
As an obituary.

1061
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,080
He has run away with my jeep!

1062
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:14,920
I am answerable to
someone, Maharani!

1063
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,240
What do I tell them now?

1064
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,720
I wonder where he is!

1065
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,080
How will I find him now?

1066
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,320
Calm down, Inspector!

1067
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,720
Get a cold drink for him.

1068
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,760
Wait! I don't want a cold drink.

1069
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:27,960
Get to the point!

1070
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,080
Get to the point?

1071
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,040
I'll get to the point.

1072
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,240
Sure, here it comes!

1073
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,520
Are you crazy?

1074
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,960
But now the case
can be filed, can't it?

1075
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:48,200
Now go tell your seniors

1076
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:52,240
you were attacked on your
way home and you were off duty.

1077
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,920
That he slashed
you with a razor,

1078
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,160
robbed you and
took away your jeep.

1079
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,080
Now the entire police
force will hunt him!

1080
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,560
Go boy!

1081
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,800
Send all-out search signals!

1082
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:10,320
Every check post should
have the jeep's license number!

1083
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,560
Listen carefully!

1084
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,880
He has stolen a police jeep.

1085
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,040
Ravi!

1086
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,120
No, I am fine.

1087
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,040
Who is this?

1088
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,880
This is Ravi.

1089
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:43,800
Where are you, Ravi?

1090
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,200
I don't know, Salim.

1091
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:46,960
I don't know anything.

1092
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,200
I don't know where
I'll go from here.

1093
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,160
I just know Pooja is
not safe in Mumbai.

1094
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:58,800
Salim, we have been betrayed.

1095
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,520
Somebody betrayed us.

1096
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:05,000
That police inspector
works for Maharani.

1097
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,520
What?

1098
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,880
I will call you again.

1099
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:13,320
Salim, please be careful.

1100
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,760
- Regards.
- Regards.

1101
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:38,000
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1102
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:42,280
Pooja, is there any place

1103
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,440
where I can leave
you and go back?

1104
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,640
You will go back there?

1105
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,320
Gotya was my friend, Pooja.

1106
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,320
The King of Rampur's palace
is a mile away from here.

1107
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:59,080
My uncle is a caretaker over there.
We can go there.

1108
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,200
OK.

1109
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,120
Rest for a while.
You look really tired.

1110
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,080
No.

1111
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,640
I must get back.

1112
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,760
I can't stop here.

1113
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,000
When will you be back?

1114
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,600
Maybe never.

1115
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,160
Who was he, Pooja?

1116
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:42,760
Blood!

1117
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,400
Let's take him to the doctor.

1118
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,160
No! No!

1119
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,120
It's a bullet wound.

1120
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:54,640
A doctor might
inform the police.

1121
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:59,040
And then they will know
where we are, Pooja.

1122
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:03,120
No, I can't go to the doctor.

1123
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,440
I won't go.

1124
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,920
I won't go to a doctor!

1125
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,040
Come on, dear!

1126
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,680
Sir, come in.

1127
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,920
Now tell me who he is
and what's wrong with him.

1128
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:44,800
It's a bullet wound.

1129
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,920
Bullet wound?
Why didn't you tell me this before?

1130
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,840
What am I supposed
to do about this?

1131
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,080
Why don't you have a look first?

1132
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:00,960
The wound has become infected
and he has lost a lot of blood.

1133
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,320
He is burning with fever!

1134
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:07,960
Shiva, I am not a doctor!

1135
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,600
- I can't do this!
- Listen to me.

1136
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,120
If you want to save him, you
must take him to a hospital!

1137
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,000
No!

1138
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,640
We can't do that!

1139
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,160
If we don't do that,
he will surely die!

1140
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,480
Right here!

1141
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:20,520
I know that!

1142
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,000
I know that very well!

1143
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:25,280
But if we take him to the hospital,
police will come to know about us.

1144
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,800
And what if that happens?

1145
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,080
Then what will happen?

1146
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,640
They'll sell me back
to the same brothel

1147
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,320
he has rescued me from.

1148
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:37,640
Sir, I beg of you!
Please do something!

1149
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,040
OK! Mix some butter and
turmeric and apply it to his wound.

1150
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,400
Mix turmeric in the
milk, give it to him

1151
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,560
as he gains consciousness.

1152
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:49,000
That's it!
And leave the rest to God!

1153
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:21,120
No, Gotya! Leave me!

1154
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:22,520
Gotya!

1155
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:26,680
- No! No! I will kill them!
- Ravi!

1156
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,720
- Gotya!
- Calm down!

1157
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,320
- Calm down!
- Gotya!

1158
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,280
- Gotya!
- Everything will be fine!

1159
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,120
- No!
- Calm down, Ravi!

1160
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,080
Everything will be fine!

1161
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,120
- No! No!
- Control yourself!

1162
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,560
- Gotya!
- Ravi.

1163
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,560
Ravi.

1164
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:52,880
Ravi!

1165
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,200
Ravi!

1166
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,440
Ravi!

1167
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:39,800
- Yes?
- Inspector Irani.

1168
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,440
I have to ask you
a few questions.

1169
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,680
Tell me.

1170
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,400
Your friend is in danger.

1171
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:54,080
If you know anything
about him, then tell me.

1172
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:57,800
I am a police officer
and I want to help.

1173
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,680
I have no idea, sir.

1174
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,760
I will let you know
if I find out anything.

1175
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:10,280
I look at your face and I can
see you know lots of things.

1176
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,560
He called you, didn't he?

1177
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,320
Didn't he?

1178
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,680
It seems you've never
been to a police station, right?

1179
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:25,680
Trust me, sir.
I don't know anything about him.

1180
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:28,760
- Why would I lie to you, sir?
- You are right.

1181
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,360
- You are not lying, right?
- No.

1182
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,880
He doesn't know anything.

1183
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:43,960
But still, keep an eye on him.

1184
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:47,200
Because he's bound
to meet him someday.

1185
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,840
- So how is he now?
- Everything is fine.

1186
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,080
He's sleeping, let him rest.

1187
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:53,800
He's waking up.

1188
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,760
You've recovered because of him.

1189
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,520
He has saved your life.

1190
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:04,160
Well, it's not me but rather her!
She's given you a new life!

1191
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,720
Thank you.

1192
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:09,040
I want to call my
friend in Mumbai.

1193
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:10,520
How can I call him?

1194
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,160
Don't get up, son! Don't get up!

1195
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:16,440
For that, you must
go to the post office.

1196
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,480
Why don't you
rest for a few days?

1197
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,920
And take this medicine.

1198
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,760
And then you will be all right.

1199
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,560
Dear, medicine.
Give him some of it.

1200
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,680
Look sir, this
is a hill station.

1201
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,240
And lots of tourists
visit this place.

1202
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:36,240
And it's really difficult to
find them in such a situation!

1203
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:38,560
But why don't you
try a little harder?

1204
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:41,120
We are sure that they
must be somewhere there!

1205
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:42,920
The girl comes from a
hill station and she is local.

1206
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,680
We'll do our best!

1207
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:49,520
They will find them.

1208
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,120
- Where's the phone?
- It's inside.

1209
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:04,560
Get me tea!
And some biscuits too!

1210
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:05,720
Uday.

1211
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,760
Isn't she Shiva's niece?

1212
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,520
No, pal, you are mistaken.

1213
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,040
But who is that guy with her?

1214
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:15,800
Who knows?
He doesn't belong here.

1215
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:19,520
Who is this?

1216
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,680
This is Ravi!

1217
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:21,560
Ravi?

1218
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,880
Where are you? And how are you?

1219
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,000
Everything is fine, Salim!

1220
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,080
Don't come over here,
they are looking for you.

1221
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:30,360
OK.

1222
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:34,160
Salim, I need some money.

1223
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,440
I hope you can send some.

1224
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:37,200
Sure, just give me your address.

1225
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,240
- The address is, Rampur Palace.
- Yes!

1226
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:42,200
- Rampur.
- OK.

1227
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:43,800
I will send you a
money order today.

1228
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,080
- Don't worry!
- OK.

1229
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:46,400
- God bless you!
- Regards.

1230
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:16,520
Dear, I am going to the market.

1231
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,520
I will be late.

1232
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,280
- Take care.
- Yes, uncle.

1233
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,240
I wouldn't have
lived without you

1234
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:44,880
I would have died
If you hadn't come.

1235
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:52,640
I wouldn't have
lived without you

1236
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:56,760
I would have died
If you hadn't come.

1237
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:01,960
I would have never known.

1238
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:05,400
What love really is

1239
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,280
I wouldn't have
lived without you.

1240
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:16,960
I wouldn't have
lived without you

1241
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:21,400
I would've died If
you hadn't come.

1242
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:25,880
I would have never known.

1243
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:29,720
What love really is

1244
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:33,360
I wouldn't have
lived without you

1245
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,720
I would've died If
you hadn't come.

1246
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:32,520
The fragrance
lingers everywhere.

1247
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:38,200
Flowers bloom That's
how the spring arrives.

1248
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:42,080
The time to fall in love.

1249
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:46,000
Comes only once.

1250
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:51,000
I feel like.

1251
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:54,120
Showering love on you

1252
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:58,480
I feel like.

1253
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,680
Accepting your love

1254
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,440
I feel like.

1255
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:09,280
Accepting your love

1256
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,960
I would have never loved
anyone Except for you.

1257
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:20,120
I would have never loved
anyone Except for you.

1258
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:23,840
How could I express my love?

1259
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:29,040
I would have never known.

1260
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:32,640
What love really is.

1261
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:36,640
I wouldn't have
lived without you

1262
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:41,480
I would've died If
you hadn't come.

1263
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:11,160
I can't forget you.

1264
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:14,960
Even if I want to

1265
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:18,520
I have waited for you.

1266
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:22,280
For many days and nights.

1267
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:27,520
If I have to.

1268
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,840
Go away from you.

1269
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:34,480
You will miss me.

1270
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,600
Every moment.

1271
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:42,120
You will miss me.

1272
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:45,720
Every moment

1273
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:49,400
I get scared when you say this.

1274
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:56,760
I get scared when you say this.

1275
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:00,680
You torment me so much.

1276
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:05,360
I would have never known.

1277
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:09,360
What love really is

1278
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:13,280
I wouldn't have
lived without you

1279
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:18,040
I would've died If
you hadn't come.

1280
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:26,640
When I look into the mirror

1281
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:30,480
I see your face my beloved.

1282
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:34,120
Whenever I breathe.

1283
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:38,560
Your fragrance
lingers in my mind.

1284
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:43,000
It's now difficult.

1285
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:46,440
To live without you

1286
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:50,400
I am your heart.

1287
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:53,800
You are mine

1288
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:57,520
I am your heart.

1289
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:01,400
You are mine

1290
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:05,040
I would have
repented all my life.

1291
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:12,280
I would have
repented all my life.

1292
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:16,360
If I'd hidden this from you.

1293
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:20,840
I would have never known.

1294
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:24,920
What love really is

1295
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,680
I wouldn't have
lived without you.

1296
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:35,880
I wouldn't have
lived without you

1297
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:40,600
I would've died If
you hadn't come

1298
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:44,640
I would have never known.

1299
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:48,720
What love really is

1300
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:52,560
I wouldn't have
lived without you

1301
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:57,240
I would've died If
you hadn't come.

1302
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:20,920
Pooja.

1303
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,480
Pooja!

1304
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:42,200
Uncle, I apologize to you

1305
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,480
for causing you problems.

1306
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,720
This is not a city, Ravi.

1307
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,560
Here people can create
mountains out of a molehill.

1308
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:51,040
I am aware of that, uncle.

1309
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:54,920
That's why I want to marry
Pooja as soon as possible.

1310
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,040
If you agree,

1311
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:00,360
I'll call Salim and ask
him to send some money.

1312
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:02,880
So that I can handle all
the wedding expenses.

1313
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:15,040
Water. Water.

1314
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:20,160
Water! Water!

1315
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:27,400
What is water, Salim?
We will give you liquor.

1316
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:29,040
And scotch! Right?

1317
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,680
But you should tell
us where your friend is!

1318
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:35,400
We have been sitting
here for two hours.

1319
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:41,480
Look, if you don't
tell us where he is,

1320
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:46,280
this macho-man will slice your
belly and take out that address

1321
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:47,840
that you gulped down!

1322
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,200
You are a scoundrel!

1323
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:52,120
Do you think I fear death?

1324
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:55,080
You want to kill
me, you can do that!

1325
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,880
But I won't tell you
where my friend is!

1326
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,280
I'll never tell you.

1327
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:02,240
Oh God! He's spitting on me!

1328
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:05,120
Irani, he's trying to scare me.

1329
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:07,000
Macho-man, kill
him and be quick!

1330
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:08,320
He spat on me?

1331
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:19,840
Dear God, how could this happen?

1332
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:28,480
Hello. May I speak to Salim?

1333
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:29,880
This is Pakya.

1334
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:32,200
What are you doing there?

1335
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:33,880
They killed him!

1336
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:36,560
Ravi, they killed Salim!

1337
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,080
Salim is no more now!

1338
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:58,200
So, old man, I hear your niece
has brought a lover from Mumbai?

1339
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:01,920
Don't you feel
ashamed for saying this?

1340
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Shame?

1341
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:05,160
You and your favorite
niece should feel ashamed.

1342
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,480
She wanders
everywhere with her lover!

1343
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:11,040
If she wanted a lover, aren't
we three enough for her?

1344
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:12,840
We would have
come at her first call!

1345
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,080
Are you blind?

1346
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:48,320
You scoundrel!
Just see where you are walking!

1347
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:49,760
What's going on here?

1348
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,200
That man over there!
Just look how he bashed all of us!

1349
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:11,520
- What?
- We found the boy!

1350
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,040
- Come again.
- Yes!

1351
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:15,880
- Does he match our description?
- Yes, sir!

1352
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:18,320
Very good, Inspector! Very good!

1353
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:23,440
Pooja? Pooja!

1354
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:26,680
Pooja?

1355
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:35,440
Pooja, they killed Salim.

1356
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:37,480
I am leaving now.

1357
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:39,800
I must leave!

1358
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:43,040
First, they killed Gotya and Chanda.
And now Salim.

1359
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:44,200
Enough is enough!

1360
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:46,680
I must stop them.

1361
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,960
No one should lose
their lives because of me.

1362
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,280
Don't cry, Pooja.

1363
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,360
Your tears will
weaken my resolve.

1364
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,640
Your love is my strength.

1365
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:30,800
I want to marry you
before you leave.

1366
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:37,480
Right here, right now.

1367
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:39,440
That's it.

1368
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:15,800
I have seen this
world and its ways.

1369
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:20,320
But nothing can replace love.

1370
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:26,400
I have seen this
world and its ways.

1371
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:30,600
But nothing can replace love.

1372
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:37,200
Come let me embrace
you My beloved.

1373
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:41,320
Nothing can replace love.

1374
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:48,080
I have seen this
world and its ways.

1375
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:52,720
But nothing can replace love.

1376
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:23,680
You are my first love

1377
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:28,880
I will give up
everything for you.

1378
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:37,440
I wish to spend my life
Entwined in your beautiful hair

1379
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:42,800
I will keep you in the
depths of my heart

1380
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:48,080
I want to live in
this sweet pain.

1381
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:52,600
Nothing can replace love.

1382
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:58,880
Come let me embrace
you, my beloved.

1383
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:03,320
Nothing can replace love.

1384
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:09,800
I have seen this
world and its ways.

1385
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:14,720
But nothing can replace love.

1386
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:27,120
Pooja, run!

1387
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,200
Pooja, run!

1388
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:47,720
Pooja, run away!

1389
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:11,200
Pooja, run away!

1390
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:13,440
Pooja, get away!

1391
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:18,360
Pooja, get away!

1392
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,160
Pick him up!

1393
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:50,040
Hey!

1394
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:06,600
- Shut up!
- No.

1395
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,080
Hold her!

1396
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:13,000
Ravi!

1397
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:02,480
Brother!

1398
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:12,720
Goldie, shut up!

1399
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:16,800
Stop howling!

1400
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,040
You bitch!

1401
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:19,880
Goldie, shut up!

1402
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:22,280
Quiet, Goldie! Shut up!

1403
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:23,600
Come on!

1404
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:27,760
Go inside and stay there!

1405
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,280
Listen, Inspector,
your dog is howling.

1406
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,960
Do you know when a dog howls?

1407
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:47,000
Whenever he smells death!

1408
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:51,640
If you can run from
your death, then run!

1409
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:42,200
So who is going to die now?

1410
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:43,880
Kill me! Come on!

1411
01:55:57,480 --> 01:55:59,800
Now, run from your
death if you can!

1412
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,680
Run!

1413
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:13,920
Are you blind, you jerk?
Can't you see?

1414
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:19,000
Hey, what are you up to?

1415
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:27,000
Move!

1416
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:36,040
Leave or else I will slash her!

1417
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:55,480
Pooja! Pooja!

1418
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:59,000
Pooja, come here.
I want to show you something.

1419
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:00,880
Come. Come on.

1420
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:03,520
Just see!

1421
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:06,960
I've decked out the entire
neighborhood for you.

1422
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:10,760
You are going to be
the bride for tonight!

1423
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:13,920
Hey, give me a smile. Come on.

1424
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:16,160
Your groom is about to come.

1425
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,240
Give me a smile. Come on.

1426
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:19,880
Maharani!

1427
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:25,480
See, here comes the scoundrel!

1428
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:31,280
Scoundrel! You are not dead yet?

1429
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:33,840
You too have nine
lives like a cat, do you?

1430
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Go and take care
of him downstairs!

1431
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:55,400
Don't shoot!

1432
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:02,080
Maharani!

1433
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:05,440
Come on out, you eunuch!

1434
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:07,080
Come on out!

1435
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:09,680
You murdered my sister!

1436
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:11,920
I won't spare you today.

1437
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:16,400
Today I'll burn you along
with your evil empire.

1438
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:18,880
You are hiding from me?

1439
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:21,200
Are you scared of me?

1440
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:22,560
Maharani!

1441
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:25,520
Macho-man, your
opponent is down there!

1442
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:28,560
I have looked after
you for this day!

1443
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:30,440
Let me see what you can do!
Hurry up!

1444
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:34,880
Come out, Maharani! You eunuch!

1445
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:39,240
Come out! Are you scared of me?

1446
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:42,760
Are you scared of death?

1447
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:30,800
Look. I don't feel pain.
Come on!

1448
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:44,880
Don't come forward! Don't!

1449
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:47,760
What kind of man are you?
Are you trying to kill a eunuch?

1450
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:52,760
I will burn down everything
if you make a move.

1451
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:57,240
I will die, but Pooja and
you will burn along with me.

1452
02:00:57,680 --> 02:01:00,080
You know my name is Maharani!

1453
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:33,960
Hit him some more!

1454
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:03,000
Thrash him!

1455
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:04,720
Finish him off!

1456
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:08,960
Kill him!

1457
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:32,840
Look there! Just look at that!

1458
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:36,480
She is going to
die like your sister!

1459
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:47,320
Brother!

1460
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:57,080
Brother, save me!

1461
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:26,840
No!

1462
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:39,360
Pooja, jump!

1463
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,400
Jump, Pooja!

1464
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:45,120
- Jump!
- Pooja! Dear, jump!

1465
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:46,440
No!

1466
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:47,360
Pooja, jump!

1467
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,880
No!

1468
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:50,600
I'm telling you, jump!

1469
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:51,800
Jump, Pooja!

1470
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:55,440
Pooja, I am here!
I am right here!

1471
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,880
Jump! Jump, Pooja!

1472
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:00,040
Oh God!

1473
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:25,240
Ravi was punished for taking
the law into his own hands.

1474
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:26,800
And then...

1475
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:40,040
I have sworn.

1476
02:04:40,120 --> 02:04:43,840
To make you mine.

1477
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:51,000
I have sworn.

1478
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:55,480
To make you mine.

1479
02:04:56,800 --> 02:05:02,240
Your eyes gleam.

1480
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:06,600
With only love.

1481
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:13,720
I have sworn.

1482
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:17,840
To make you mine.

1483
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:47,160
I will let everyone know.

1484
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:50,640
What love really is.

1485
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:56,120
I will let everyone know.

1486
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:59,400
What love really is

1487
02:05:59,480 --> 02:06:02,800
I will vanquish everyone.

1488
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:05,920
For you.

1489
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:11,200
Your love.

1490
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:15,840
Has made me crazy.

1491
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:22,920
Your love.

1492
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Has made me crazy.

1493
02:06:28,280 --> 02:06:34,080
I have sworn.

1494
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:38,440
To make you mine
