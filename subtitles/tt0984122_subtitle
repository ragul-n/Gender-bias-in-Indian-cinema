1
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:26,374
He is Swami, a simple and honest
man, who is <i>living...</i>

2
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:29,040
<i>...his</i> life with simplicity in a
small village in Maharashtra.

3
00:05:04,884 --> 00:05:10,481
And she is the Swamis life-Iong
earning. His wife, Radha.

4
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:14,985
Swamis life revolves
around Radha.

5
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:18,431
They have a priceless bond,
which was made 10 <i>years...</i>

6
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:20,022
<i>...ago</i> when they got married.

7
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:25,436
And since then they have
craved to <i>become...</i>

8
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:27,837
<i>...a</i> parent of a small baby.

9
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:31,433
It is said that prayers
are very powerful.

10
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:34,443
They never gave up hope.

11
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:38,844
But God has to yield
to their request.

12
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:41,719
After being childless
for many <i>years...</i>

13
00:05:42,722 --> 00:05:44,690
<i>...they</i> are finally going
to have a child.

14
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:49,525
Radha is a South-Indian Brahmin.

15
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:55,699
And Swami is an orthodox
Maharashtrian Brahmin.

16
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:12,846
Radha, take care of yourself.

17
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:14,748
I will take care of myself.

18
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:16,916
But you dont take care of yourself.

19
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:18,215
Why?

20
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:19,783
What happened to me?

21
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:21,721
I am observing it for the
past few days <i>that...</i>

22
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:23,888
<i>...you</i> bring your lunch back home.

23
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:26,825
You are pestered with
worries more than I.

24
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,094
It is not like that.

25
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:32,029
Oh! So I dont cook food
properly these days.

26
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:33,764
Radha.

27
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:35,633
Dont worry.

28
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:38,506
If God had intended to keep
us childless, he <i>wouldnt...</i>

29
00:06:38,578 --> 00:06:41,069
<i>...have</i> given us a ray of
hope after so many years.

30
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:45,809
Please hold this.

31
00:06:59,265 --> 00:07:01,597
Oh! Is it so?

32
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,730
Did you get it!

33
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,537
I know dear. I wont
lift heavy objects.

34
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:16,543
All right.
- You can go.

35
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:50,579
The relationship spreads
<i>fragrance...</i>

36
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,050
<i>...like</i> old sandalwood.

37
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:58,216
Life is a bond of breath.

38
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:02,718
You cant break it
even if you try.

39
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:07,296
You cant separate
it even if you try.

40
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:11,296
The relationship spreads
<i>fragrance...</i>

41
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:13,898
<i>...like</i> old sandalwood.

42
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:19,111
Life is a bond of breath.

43
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:24,615
You cant break it
even if you try.

44
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:29,618
You cant separate
it even if you try.

45
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:39,064
Master, my master.

46
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:44,193
Master, my master.

47
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:50,641
The way a wick burns
along with the lamp.

48
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:57,644
The way the breeze brings
the news of spring.

49
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:02,981
I too cant live without you.

50
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:14,028
I cant live without you.

51
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:16,059
Hey! Vegetable-seller.

52
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:17,795
Greetings.
- Greetings.

53
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:28,339
Hail Lord!

54
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:33,843
Hey! Vegetable-seller.

55
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:46,822
Hey! Welcome. Welcome, Mr. Parikh.

56
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,958
How are you, Swami?

57
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:49,092
You have come after a long time.

58
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:50,829
Greetings, sister-in-law.
- <i>Greetings. -  Greetings.

59
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:53,031
Swami, if I come here daily
then I will become bankrupt.

60
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:54,431
Come on.

61
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:56,700
Show me some beautiful bracelets.

62
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:57,834
Yes, sister-in-law. Sure.

63
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:05,082
Look at these. These are
the new <i>designs. -  Yes.

64
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:06,713
And in this town you will
find the best <i>designs...</i>

65
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:08,219
<i>...only</i> in this shop.

66
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:12,725
Do you want to see this? Yes.

67
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:17,855
It looks so beautiful.

68
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:21,191
You can buy it if you like it.

69
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:23,735
Mr. Parikh, sister-in-laws
choice is very good.

70
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:26,000
You have selected the
best <i>bracelet. -  Right!

71
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:27,830
Look. You can also check it.

72
00:10:28,374 --> 00:10:30,740
Why do they appear to
be same to me, Swami?

73
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:33,735
Mr. Parikh. Its because
you have <i>come...</i>

74
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:37,374
<i>...to</i> buy gold only for
your satisfaction.

75
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,885
But sister-in-law has come
here to satisfy herself.

76
00:10:40,286 --> 00:10:42,948
It is a matter of each
ones point of view.

77
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:47,050
Swami, we are leaving.

78
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:51,821
Swami!

79
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:53,456
Greetings sir.
- Greetings to you.

80
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:56,769
Whats the matter? Have
you sold some <i>jewelry...</i>

81
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:57,962
<i>...even</i> before I could come here?

82
00:10:58,771 --> 00:10:59,897
Lord Ganpati is kind to us.

83
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:03,206
How is Radha?
- She is fine.

84
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:07,310
She has got a new companion
who keeps her busy all day.

85
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,772
Companion?
- Yes. Her TV.

86
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:15,777
Greetings! Todays special report.

87
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:18,314
It is said the real India
is in the villages.

88
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:20,793
But even today the level
of <i>education...</i>

89
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,225
<i>...in</i> villages and towns is pathetic.

90
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:24,826
Instead things are getting
worse as each day passes.

91
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:27,798
On one hand computer education
has <i>become...</i>

92
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:31,530
...compulsory in cities like Mumbai,
Delhi and Bangalore.

93
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:34,102
English has become
a common language.

94
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,808
On the other hand people in
the smaller towns have <i>been...</i>

95
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:37,934
...denied all these things.

96
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:39,801
It is still a distant dream.

97
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:41,271
Who is responsible for this?

98
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:44,813
The government or the fate
of the children <i>who...</i>

99
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:47,352
<i>...have</i> been born in small towns.

100
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:49,921
This was our special report.

101
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:51,886
Now listen to the weather report.

102
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:58,021
Take this.

103
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,124
Sir, here you are.

104
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:09,533
Okay brother.
- All right. Bye.

105
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:23,113
Gotya, stop!

106
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:24,982
Pandu, hurry up!

107
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:26,856
Gotya, stop!

108
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:39,529
Pandu!

109
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:41,030
What is it?

110
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:42,165
Look at that!

111
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:47,543
Why is the tree swaying?

112
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:51,548
My mother says there are
ghosts in the trees.

113
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:58,016
Yes, it looks like a
very dangerous ghost!

114
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:00,490
He is shaking the tree so violently!

115
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,225
Come on, run!
- Run!

116
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:07,423
Gotya!

117
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:11,426
The ghost knows your name!

118
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:13,030
Pandu!

119
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,965
The ghost also knows your name!

120
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:18,101
Come on, run!

121
00:13:18,177 --> 00:13:19,235
Wait!

122
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:22,037
O Lord! O Lord!
- O Lord! O Lord!

123
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:26,274
O Lord! O Lord!
- O Lord! O Lord!

124
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:37,927
Shucks! Uncle Swami, so it is you!

125
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:39,055
Who else?

126
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:40,599
You had us frightened.

127
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,935
We thought there was a dangerous
ghost on the tree.

128
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:46,938
Do I look like a ghost? Come here.

129
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:48,198
Help me in collecting the flowers.

130
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:51,066
Yes, quickly! Come on.

131
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:54,173
This one.
- Pick this.

132
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:55,305
Pick this one.

133
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:57,140
What about this?

134
00:13:58,518 --> 00:14:00,281
Wonderful!
- Take these.

135
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:09,552
Uncle Swami, arent you taking
these for aunt Radha?

136
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:11,088
Right!
- Right!

137
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:12,589
You rascals!

138
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,026
Uncle Swami!

139
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:17,493
Very naughty!

140
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,162
Uncle Swami!

141
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:20,597
Come here!

142
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:10,022
Is it so?

143
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:12,149
As if you have understood
everything!

144
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:16,755
Come on, freshen up.

145
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:18,354
All right.

146
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:34,304
There is a good aroma all around.

147
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:35,605
Have you prepared something special?

148
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:39,345
Its Payasam! Kheer! (Rice pudding)

149
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:43,118
Change your clothes. I
will serve the food.

150
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:51,056
I have still not <i>understood...</i>

151
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,065
<i>...why</i> you collect these
5 rupee coins?

152
00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:57,068
Radha, you must have <i>seen...</i>

153
00:15:57,136 --> 00:16:01,072
...little children building
houses of sand.

154
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:03,807
I have not just seen it I
used to make them myself.

155
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:05,403
It was great fun!

156
00:16:08,814 --> 00:16:10,748
Sometimes the houses were good.
Other times not so good.

157
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:12,542
So they were rebuilt.

158
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,511
You will not find any reasons for
this building and rebuilding.

159
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:19,818
So are you trying to become
a child again at this age?

160
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,592
Radha, I wish I could.

161
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:24,094
You grow old only in your mind.

162
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:28,767
The heart wants to do certain
things but the mind refuses.

163
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:30,566
I dont care about
what the mind says.

164
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:32,167
I will only listen to my heart.

165
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:36,141
Listen, right now my heart tells
me we should have our food.

166
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:38,234
Give it to me.

167
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:42,108
Did you like the kheer?

168
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:47,109
I wanted to tell you something.

169
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:49,545
Speak up!

170
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:51,112
They were showing on TV <i>that...</i>

171
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:54,355
<i>...the</i> education level in
the villages is pathetic.

172
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:56,853
There are good schools
in the cities.

173
00:16:57,396 --> 00:17:00,229
There are big classrooms!
They teach you English.

174
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:01,791
They teach you about computers.

175
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:03,260
The teachers are also good.

176
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:08,863
Why dont we move to the cities?

177
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:14,346
I told you because my
heart asked me to.

178
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:18,614
My mind was refusing but
I did not listen to it.

179
00:17:20,386 --> 00:17:23,150
It is really well cooked!
I mean the kheer!

180
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:32,163
Please tie this.

181
00:17:32,365 --> 00:17:33,423
Okay, give it.

182
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,266
Did I say anything wrong?

183
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:45,171
Radha, you are right. We
have spent our <i>lives...</i>

184
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:48,270
...without any excitement.

185
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:50,912
But now we will not let
our child <i>future...</i>

186
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:53,310
Is it okay?

187
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:12,600
Anand, why are you shouting? Today
is your fathers pay-day.

188
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:15,263
He will bring a lot of toys for you.

189
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:18,867
Wonderful! Your father has arrived!

190
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:25,614
Have you bought the whole toy shop?

191
00:18:25,684 --> 00:18:26,742
Is he asleep?

192
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:30,251
No, he just woke up. Oh
God! Its too heavy!

193
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:34,223
Anand!
- Anand, look at this!

194
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:36,657
Anand, look what your father
has brought for you!

195
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:37,820
Look what your father
has brought for you!

196
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:38,955
Look at this!

197
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:46,525
Slowly, walk towards me, my child.

198
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,294
My child! My child!

199
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:50,301
Dont fall! Dont fall!

200
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:51,893
You will fall down!

201
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:55,372
Slowly, walk towards me, my child.

202
00:20:17,963 --> 00:20:21,330
Swami will make my
dreams come true.

203
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,763
He will fill my life
with happiness.

204
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:38,681
Father! Mother! Father!

205
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:50,146
Stop! Stop, Swami! Swami!

206
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:51,689
Catch me, mother!

207
00:21:51,757 --> 00:21:53,054
Stop! Where are you going?

208
00:21:53,992 --> 00:22:00,693
Stop! Come here! Son! Son!

209
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:02,925
Move!

210
00:22:06,338 --> 00:22:10,399
Hakka-bai! Tell your son
to stay in his limits!

211
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:12,939
How dare he sit on this chair?

212
00:22:13,378 --> 00:22:15,710
You work in my house.
So I spared him!

213
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:17,441
Otherwise I would have
beaten him more!

214
00:22:17,783 --> 00:22:19,842
Take him away! Get lost!

215
00:22:25,223 --> 00:22:28,215
Dont cry, Swami! You are
my good boy, arent you?

216
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:30,455
You like the chair?
- Yes, mother.

217
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:32,258
I will get such a chair for you.

218
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:34,732
My good child!

219
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,861
Whats the matter? You cant sleep?

220
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:04,791
Swami!
- Yes, sir!

221
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:06,490
I have good news for you!

222
00:23:06,965 --> 00:23:09,456
My friend has opened a jewellery
shop in Mumbai.

223
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:12,469
And he needs an accountant.

224
00:23:12,537 --> 00:23:14,937
Go and meet him. I have told
him to give you a job.

225
00:23:15,073 --> 00:23:18,406
Thanks! I will complete the
work and go in the evening.

226
00:23:18,477 --> 00:23:21,344
No! Not in the evening!
Go right now!

227
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:24,007
By evening there will be many
candidates for this post.

228
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:25,480
But the <i>work...</i>

229
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,314
Swami, go! Go! Work will go on! Go!

230
00:23:28,386 --> 00:23:31,844
I am leaving! Thanks!
- Fine!

231
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:57,077
Who is it?
- Swami.

232
00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:00,084
Swami who?
- Wawan has sent me.

233
00:24:00,152 --> 00:24:01,847
I see! Come in!

234
00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:06,357
Greetings.
- Greetings.

235
00:24:06,424 --> 00:24:09,222
Wawan told me about you.
- Yes.

236
00:24:09,294 --> 00:24:11,228
I have a jewellery shop in Mumbai.

237
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:12,854
My manager looks after the shop.

238
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:14,831
I will give you a letter
addressed to <i>him. -  Okay.

239
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,958
You will get the job.

240
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:18,869
Stay here! I will be
back in 5 minutes.

241
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:22,237
Will you have tea or
something, Swami?

242
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:24,832
No. Thanks.
- Okay.

243
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:51,166
Uncle, will you play
volleyball with me?

244
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:53,562
Okay.

245
00:24:56,508 --> 00:24:58,976
Uncle, go and get the ball!

246
00:24:59,144 --> 00:25:02,875
You <i>see...</i> I am playing
it after a long time.

247
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:06,247
When did you play last?
- When I was of your age.

248
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:09,151
You were of my age?
- Yes.

249
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:11,620
Then how did you grow up so big?

250
00:25:12,991 --> 00:25:17,325
By running! If you too will run fast
like me, you will grow up quickly!

251
00:25:17,395 --> 00:25:18,521
Is that so?

252
00:25:18,597 --> 00:25:20,622
Yes! Quickly get the ball! Come on!

253
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:32,270
Uncle, now I will quickly
grow up, wont I? - Yes!

254
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:34,103
Lets play it again!

255
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:38,246
Quickly get it!

256
00:26:12,117 --> 00:26:14,950
I am sorry. I dozed off.

257
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,955
Thats fine, Swami. If you are
tired, then rest for a while.

258
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:19,081
No, thanks.

259
00:26:19,157 --> 00:26:23,321
Here is the letter. Your
work will be done.

260
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:35,439
Thanks, sir!

261
00:26:40,645 --> 00:26:44,979
Oh my God! Anand, come here!

262
00:26:45,116 --> 00:26:46,344
What happened, mother?

263
00:26:46,418 --> 00:26:49,979
Look, such a big building!
Such a long bridge!

264
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:59,225
Oh my God! So big! Its
so nice, mother!

265
00:26:59,331 --> 00:27:01,731
Its America! America!

266
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,997
America! Where is it?
- Its far away!

267
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,731
Furtherer than the moon too?

268
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:11,074
No! Moon is in the sky!
This is on the earth!

269
00:27:11,142 --> 00:27:16,079
Oh my God! - As if you have
understood everything!

270
00:27:16,147 --> 00:27:21,016
So what? I will carry
you and take you!

271
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:24,180
Wow! You will carry me!

272
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:29,693
If you will do this, I wont
take you! I will go alone!

273
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:32,025
You will go alone, leaving me!

274
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:47,769
Radha! Radha! Look!

275
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:49,306
What happened?

276
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:53,044
<i>This...</i> Anand will study in Mumbai.
- How?

277
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:58,045
<i>This...</i> I have got a job! Look!

278
00:27:58,656 --> 00:28:00,180
In Mumbai!
- Yes!

279
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:01,589
You got a job?
- Yes!

280
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:07,564
Oh my God! Anand! Anand!

281
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:20,470
Radha!

282
00:28:24,082 --> 00:28:26,346
My parents had built this
house with so much love.

283
00:28:28,586 --> 00:28:30,611
I too spend my life here.

284
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:35,658
Anand too was born here. I dont
feel like leaving this house.

285
00:28:35,727 --> 00:28:39,128
Father! Father!

286
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:42,291
Father!
- Yes! Come! - Father!

287
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:45,827
But I will have to
leave for his sake.

288
00:28:54,112 --> 00:28:55,170
Swami!

289
00:28:57,215 --> 00:28:59,809
You?
- Greetings! Greetings!

290
00:28:59,884 --> 00:29:02,250
Greetings, Radha!
- Greetings!

291
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,750
Your house has fetched
a good price, Swami.

292
00:29:05,123 --> 00:29:08,581
You will get a rented
house in Mumbai.

293
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,854
Its your grace.

294
00:29:10,862 --> 00:29:13,763
Take care!
- Okay.

295
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:15,322
I will leave now.
- Thanks a <i>lot. -  Okay.

296
00:29:29,214 --> 00:29:31,375
We will go to Mumbai!
We will go to Mumbai!

297
00:29:31,449 --> 00:29:33,610
We will go to Mumbai! We will
go to Mumbai! - Anand too!

298
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:36,381
We will go to Mumbai!
We will go to Mumbai!

299
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:27,401
We will be born countless times.

300
00:30:27,472 --> 00:30:32,500
But we will never separate.

301
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:43,218
Whether we receive joy or sorrow.

302
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:48,225
Our love will never wane.

303
00:30:48,426 --> 00:30:53,523
We have taken this oath.

304
00:30:53,598 --> 00:30:58,399
We have taken this oath.

305
00:30:58,469 --> 00:31:01,302
We have taken this oath.

306
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:28,899
We got such a nice
house at low rent!

307
00:31:36,975 --> 00:31:38,567
Its so breezy!

308
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:42,546
And the entire city can
be seen from here! Look!

309
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:46,278
Look! Another good thing is <i>that...</i>

310
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:50,014
...Anand will always
be in front of me.

311
00:31:51,422 --> 00:31:54,289
Look! You didnt see this!

312
00:31:54,425 --> 00:31:57,758
The landlord is so nice!
He left a sofa!

313
00:31:58,997 --> 00:32:01,329
Now I will sit and rest!

314
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:18,373
Get up! Get up! Get up!

315
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:33,388
Landlords sofa!
- Yes! I became the laughingstock.

316
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:39,469
You adorn your sweet house.
I will go to the shop.

317
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:41,061
Fine?
- Go!

318
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:42,470
Hold this!

319
00:32:44,075 --> 00:32:45,667
Father! Father!
- Yes!

320
00:32:45,743 --> 00:32:48,678
Take me along too! I want
to go for an outing!

321
00:32:48,746 --> 00:32:53,649
Son, if we both went then
mother will be alone.

322
00:32:53,718 --> 00:32:56,346
There should be one man at home.
- Is that so?

323
00:32:56,421 --> 00:33:00,619
Yes! We will go out later.
Right now you help mother.

324
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:02,617
Okay!

325
00:33:02,694 --> 00:33:06,892
Okay! Listen! Dont let
mother sit on the sofa!

326
00:33:19,677 --> 00:33:21,372
Wow, my brave son!

327
00:33:38,096 --> 00:33:40,530
I see! Swami!
- Yes!

328
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:42,429
You can join from tomorrow.

329
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,491
Or if you want, you
can join from today.

330
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:46,628
I need a day or two.

331
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:50,401
Why? I see! You want
to find a house.

332
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:51,965
No! I have found a house.

333
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:56,137
I have to enrol my son in a school.
- Where?

334
00:33:56,214 --> 00:33:58,774
I still dont know.
I have to find out.

335
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:03,952
There is a nice school nearby.
Hansraj Morarji school.

336
00:34:04,021 --> 00:34:06,819
Is it English medium school?
- Yes.

337
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:13,494
What name you said?
- Hansraj Morarji school.

338
00:34:13,564 --> 00:34:15,031
<i>Hansraj...</i>

339
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:20,467
Fine. I will try for the admission.
Then I will join work.

340
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:22,529
Okay.
- <i>Greetings. -  Bye.

341
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:42,082
Look! How can it be him?

342
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:12,481
Oh my God! - As if you have
understood everything!

343
00:35:13,524 --> 00:35:15,492
Tomorrow morning we have to <i>go...</i>

344
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,788
<i>...for</i> Anands schools admission.

345
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:19,694
Get ready soon. Its an
English medium school.

346
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:20,822
Is that so?

347
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:24,934
Mother! School!

348
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:31,167
Answer the teacher correctly.
Dont be mischievous.

349
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:34,605
Okay, mother. I wont
be mischievous.

350
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:37,113
Remember? You had promised me.

351
00:35:37,181 --> 00:35:41,618
I remember, mother. What
did you say, mother?

352
00:35:42,186 --> 00:35:44,552
Naughty child! You
forgot everything!

353
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:47,551
You have to study and
become a big man.

354
00:35:47,658 --> 00:35:49,216
You have to go to America.

355
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:53,696
I know that. I was testing whether
you remember or not.

356
00:35:55,533 --> 00:36:00,266
Look, you can play pranks
at home with your mother.

357
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:03,000
But not in the school!

358
00:36:03,074 --> 00:36:07,272
Listen to the teacher. Study well.

359
00:36:07,545 --> 00:36:09,570
Otherwise you wont be
able to go to America.

360
00:36:11,816 --> 00:36:13,283
Mother, I will go to America.

361
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:18,186
I will take you too! I wont
be mischievous. Fine, mother?

362
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:20,918
Okay! Lets go!

363
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:22,550
Come on! Hurry up! Hurry up!

364
00:36:22,627 --> 00:36:25,687
Oh my God! What have you worn?
- What?

365
00:36:26,097 --> 00:36:28,292
We are going for Anands
schools <i>admission. -  So?

366
00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:31,164
Its an English medium school.
Will you wear this?

367
00:36:31,702 --> 00:36:32,760
Wait!

368
00:36:36,574 --> 00:36:37,973
Wear this!

369
00:36:38,976 --> 00:36:41,877
This will be fine! Change quickly!

370
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:46,641
Keep quiet!

371
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:50,577
Its auspicious to have curd
and sugar before leaving.

372
00:36:50,655 --> 00:36:52,680
Open your mouth. You too!

373
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:57,819
Its done!

374
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,591
Lets go! We are getting late!

375
00:37:00,665 --> 00:37:02,895
Come on! Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

376
00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:05,224
Close the door!

377
00:37:17,748 --> 00:37:22,208
<i>Look...</i> your child cant
get the <i>admission. -  Why?

378
00:37:22,286 --> 00:37:24,652
Because our school has
its own prestige.

379
00:37:24,722 --> 00:37:28,852
We give admission only to children
with educated parents.

380
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:32,225
My son will study.

381
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:35,628
What difference will it make
whether we are educated or not?

382
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,167
It makes a lot of difference.

383
00:37:37,234 --> 00:37:41,330
If parents are not educated, how
will they teach the child?

384
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:44,767
We will teach him! You
give him the admission!

385
00:37:44,842 --> 00:37:48,278
<i>Look...</i> you are wasting my
and your time by arguing.

386
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,117
Listen to me. Get your son enrolled
in some government school.

387
00:37:55,353 --> 00:37:57,821
If we had to enrol him in
a government <i>school...</i>

388
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,947
<i>...then</i> why would we had left
our village and come here?

389
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:02,252
This school is very expensive.

390
00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:03,654
People pay thousands as <i>donation...</i>

391
00:38:03,728 --> 00:38:05,889
<i>...for</i> their childrens admission.

392
00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:08,124
You people wont be
able to afford it.

393
00:38:08,232 --> 00:38:16,401
You people take money for
education? Its not right.

394
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:19,905
Its not in my hands.
I cant do anything.

395
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:26,282
Aunt! That aunt is not
giving me admission!

396
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:29,217
Go and tell her to give
me the admission.

397
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:33,680
Please! Go! I am sorry.

398
00:38:33,824 --> 00:38:36,884
I have to take my
parents to America.

399
00:38:36,961 --> 00:38:39,429
If I wont study, I wont
be able to go to America.

400
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:43,198
I will do whatever
my mother told me.

401
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:46,703
I will study hard. I
will obey my teacher.

402
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:50,707
Please tell her to enrol
me in her school!

403
00:38:50,975 --> 00:38:55,071
Enrol me in this school.
I will be a good child.

404
00:39:10,928 --> 00:39:14,420
Excuse me! Excuse me!

405
00:39:16,734 --> 00:39:19,726
Principal has called you. Go.

406
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:26,736
Greetings.
- <i>Greetings. -  Come in!

407
00:39:27,111 --> 00:39:28,976
Anand!
- Come here!

408
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:32,073
Greetings. Have a seat.

409
00:39:32,149 --> 00:39:33,309
Thats okay.

410
00:39:34,885 --> 00:39:39,185
Your son is very sweet! He
will study in this school!

411
00:39:39,557 --> 00:39:42,117
He wants to study in this <i>school...</i>

412
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:44,252
...because he wants to
fulfil your dream.

413
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:49,230
At such a young age, he said
this and he won my heart.

414
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:52,765
You dont worry. I will
look after him.

415
00:39:58,142 --> 00:39:59,769
Fine!

416
00:39:59,844 --> 00:40:01,778
Greetings.
- Greetings.

417
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:04,781
Thanks!
- Come! Come!

418
00:40:10,154 --> 00:40:12,952
Carefully! Climb the stairs.

419
00:40:17,795 --> 00:40:19,057
Radha.
- Yes.

420
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,791
You go and buy the groceries.
I will just come.

421
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:22,526
Okay. Lets go.

422
00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:31,332
Yes, sir.

423
00:40:32,409 --> 00:40:34,138
Whats the cost of this chair?

424
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:37,009
18500 rupees. Its an
antique piece, sir.

425
00:40:39,216 --> 00:40:41,275
Greetings.
- Bye.

426
00:40:52,029 --> 00:40:55,226
If you like that chair so much,
then why dont you buy it?

427
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,560
You need money for that.
- Take it from the piggy bank.

428
00:41:01,038 --> 00:41:05,099
Beware if you tried
to break it, Radha!

429
00:41:05,943 --> 00:41:10,846
I like those 5 rupees coins
a lot. I will never spend it.

430
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:13,477
You too!

431
00:41:27,031 --> 00:41:29,465
Radha, I am leaving for work.
- Okay.

432
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:35,327
Anand! Your tie!

433
00:41:36,874 --> 00:41:38,865
<i>This... this...</i>

434
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:41,878
Mother, you dont know
how to wear the tie!

435
00:41:41,946 --> 00:41:43,345
I dont know!

436
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,144
Who taught you?

437
00:41:47,218 --> 00:41:49,186
That senior madam taught me!

438
00:41:51,121 --> 00:41:54,989
You felt bad?
- No!

439
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,589
Mother! Mother! What happened?

440
00:42:02,299 --> 00:42:05,462
My stomach is aching.

441
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:16,407
Have water!

442
00:42:18,015 --> 00:42:24,318
Shall I call the doctor?
- No. I am fine.

443
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:27,250
Come. I have to take
you to the school.

444
00:42:27,324 --> 00:42:31,920
No. You are not fine. I will
go to the school alone.

445
00:42:31,996 --> 00:42:34,624
I remember the way to the school.

446
00:42:34,698 --> 00:42:36,928
I know the traffic signal too.

447
00:42:37,001 --> 00:42:38,662
Now I have grown up, mother.

448
00:42:38,736 --> 00:42:42,035
And I will get a doctor
on my way back.

449
00:42:42,306 --> 00:42:43,671
Oh my God!

450
00:42:45,209 --> 00:42:47,177
Will you take me to your school?

451
00:42:47,244 --> 00:42:48,939
You want to go out?
- Yes.

452
00:42:49,013 --> 00:42:50,105
Come with me!

453
00:42:51,048 --> 00:42:54,381
Father!
- Come! Run! Run!

454
00:42:54,451 --> 00:42:55,679
Lets go!

455
00:42:56,954 --> 00:43:00,617
Father, I will take you.
- Is that so?

456
00:43:00,691 --> 00:43:03,216
Now I have grown up, father!
- Yes, son.

457
00:43:03,294 --> 00:43:04,955
Today in the morning
mother held my <i>hand...</i>

458
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:07,623
<i>...and</i> I brought her here.
- Mother held your hand?

459
00:43:07,698 --> 00:43:12,658
Yes. Mother was not fine. She
had severe stomach-ache.

460
00:43:13,237 --> 00:43:15,137
Your mother?
- Yes.

461
00:43:15,973 --> 00:43:17,634
Is that so? Lets go.

462
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:24,707
Mother! Mother!

463
00:43:25,983 --> 00:43:27,348
Anand!

464
00:43:27,418 --> 00:43:29,386
Radha!
- Yes.

465
00:43:29,453 --> 00:43:32,581
You were not well in the morning?
- Yes. <i>But...</i>

466
00:43:32,656 --> 00:43:34,123
You should have called me.
I would have come home.

467
00:43:34,191 --> 00:43:37,058
It was just for sometime.
Later I felt better.

468
00:43:37,127 --> 00:43:39,721
I will take an off tomorrow. I
will take you to a nice doctor.

469
00:43:41,665 --> 00:43:45,465
Why are you worried? No
need to go to the doctor.

470
00:43:45,536 --> 00:43:48,004
Tomorrow we are going to
the doctor! Thats it!

471
00:43:54,411 --> 00:43:57,209
Drive slowly. She is not well.
- Okay.

472
00:44:31,415 --> 00:44:34,782
She has bilateral renal
arteries stenosis.

473
00:44:35,185 --> 00:44:36,243
Meaning?

474
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,788
Her kidney artery
has got compressed.

475
00:44:38,856 --> 00:44:40,790
Because of that her blood
circulation has stopped.

476
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:42,587
So she has stomach-ache.

477
00:44:45,295 --> 00:44:47,092
No need to worry.

478
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:49,328
We will have to perform
a small operation.

479
00:44:49,733 --> 00:44:51,792
The blood circulation
will become normal.

480
00:44:52,803 --> 00:44:54,065
Operation?

481
00:44:54,371 --> 00:44:57,807
Operation is important. Till then
I will prescribe some medicine.

482
00:45:00,077 --> 00:45:01,408
What will be the cost?

483
00:45:02,646 --> 00:45:04,079
Around 20000-25000 rupees.

484
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:45,179
What happened?

485
00:46:11,548 --> 00:46:14,142
For me, you had to break
your piggy bank.

486
00:46:16,553 --> 00:46:17,884
No, Radha!

487
00:46:20,324 --> 00:46:22,884
These 5 rupees coins are not
more important than you.

488
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:48,715
8,755 rupees!

489
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,285
Fine. Give.

490
00:47:10,607 --> 00:47:14,202
When did you come?
- You rest! Rest!

491
00:47:14,278 --> 00:47:17,611
I just dozed off.
- Thats okay.

492
00:47:19,383 --> 00:47:24,514
<i>Radha...</i> from tomorrow I will
come home <i>late. -  Why?

493
00:47:24,955 --> 00:47:28,721
There is shortage of money.
I will have to work overtime.

494
00:47:32,496 --> 00:47:34,225
You take care.

495
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:37,593
What has happened to me?

496
00:47:40,237 --> 00:47:41,795
Everything will be fine.

497
00:47:52,382 --> 00:47:57,285
Try to live separately for a day.

498
00:47:57,754 --> 00:48:02,248
Separately for a day.

499
00:48:07,998 --> 00:48:12,935
Whenever the eyes opened.

500
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:18,264
Your image dwelled in my eyes.

501
00:48:18,475 --> 00:48:23,469
Both of them forgot the world.

502
00:48:23,547 --> 00:48:28,348
Both of them forgot the world.

503
00:48:28,418 --> 00:48:31,012
Forgot the world.

504
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:56,344
Sir, I will leave.
- Okay.

505
00:48:57,748 --> 00:49:00,308
Take <i>this. -  I wont be able
to come <i>tomorrow. -  Why?

506
00:49:00,384 --> 00:49:04,980
I have to take my wife to the
doctor. I will leave <i>now. -  Okay.

507
00:49:58,642 --> 00:50:03,375
I have been observing since a long
time. You like this chair a lot.

508
00:50:03,513 --> 00:50:05,538
Its not right, Radha!

509
00:50:05,615 --> 00:50:07,640
You dont know what you have done!

510
00:50:08,685 --> 00:50:13,987
I know! I spend the money
kept for my treatment.

511
00:50:16,026 --> 00:50:17,926
You fulfil all my wishes.

512
00:50:18,862 --> 00:50:21,956
Cant I fulfil your small wish?

513
00:50:22,032 --> 00:50:24,023
Radha, I like this chair a lot!

514
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:26,130
But your operation
was more important!

515
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,028
From where will I get so much money?

516
00:50:31,808 --> 00:50:37,405
I have bought it with so much love.
And you are scolding me.

517
00:50:42,652 --> 00:50:44,882
You will make me work overtime.

518
00:50:51,428 --> 00:50:55,159
Didnt you see? Our name
too is engraved on it.

519
00:51:05,942 --> 00:51:07,170
Radha!

520
00:51:22,492 --> 00:51:24,926
Anand! Sit there!

521
00:51:24,995 --> 00:51:26,587
What is this, father!

522
00:51:26,663 --> 00:51:30,099
Since morning you are saying
to sit here, to sit there!

523
00:51:30,167 --> 00:51:32,192
I have to complete my homework!

524
00:51:32,269 --> 00:51:34,965
For the last time, son.
- You always say that!

525
00:51:35,038 --> 00:51:39,202
Move! Come on! Come on!

526
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:41,467
My sweet child!

527
00:52:08,705 --> 00:52:10,229
What is this?

528
00:52:11,641 --> 00:52:13,575
Moving the chair!

529
00:52:13,643 --> 00:52:18,239
Fool! - You too, father! You
didnt find the place!

530
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:19,782
I wont let you sit!

531
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,215
Making me mad!

532
00:52:23,186 --> 00:52:24,244
Radha!

533
00:53:25,882 --> 00:53:28,180
You will like this now.

534
00:53:28,251 --> 00:53:33,314
Oh my God!
- You are welcome.

535
00:53:38,028 --> 00:53:39,222
Very good!

536
00:53:54,945 --> 00:53:59,211
<i>Radha...</i> I will be late tonight.
Dont wait for <i>me. -  Okay.

537
00:54:18,034 --> 00:54:19,365
Are you leaving?
- Yes.

538
00:54:25,942 --> 00:54:27,307
You have come?

539
00:54:28,745 --> 00:54:30,736
Radha, you are still awake!

540
00:54:33,149 --> 00:54:35,140
I wanted to talk to you.

541
00:54:35,852 --> 00:54:37,649
Its 3 oclock in the night.

542
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:39,382
Go to sleep. We will talk
tomorrow morning.

543
00:54:41,858 --> 00:54:45,692
Not here. Sit on your chair.

544
00:54:47,063 --> 00:54:48,121
Chair?

545
00:54:51,334 --> 00:54:53,996
I want to see you seated
on your chair.

546
00:55:08,018 --> 00:55:09,076
Fine.

547
00:55:11,421 --> 00:55:16,358
Do you <i>know...</i> today Anands
teacher was very happy.

548
00:55:17,227 --> 00:55:21,220
She was <i>saying...</i> he is
brilliant in studies.

549
00:55:24,134 --> 00:55:26,068
He is mischievous too.

550
00:55:29,272 --> 00:55:34,710
Once I had told <i>him...</i> America
is a nice place.

551
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:42,712
He said I will carry you there.
- Naughty boy!

552
00:55:44,421 --> 00:55:48,414
Will Anand go to America?
- Yes, Radha.

553
00:55:51,728 --> 00:55:54,788
Will he go?
- Yes.

554
00:57:30,827 --> 00:57:37,062
Radhe.

555
00:57:38,368 --> 00:57:42,168
Radhe.

556
00:57:42,238 --> 00:57:45,537
Radhe.

557
00:57:46,876 --> 00:57:51,836
Radhe.

558
00:57:51,915 --> 00:57:52,973
Mother!

559
00:57:53,049 --> 00:57:59,454
Radhe.
- Mother!

560
00:58:14,871 --> 00:58:20,935
When God grants wishes.

561
00:58:21,878 --> 00:58:27,874
Then soul unites with soul.

562
00:58:32,222 --> 00:58:38,957
Departure of the body
is not separation.

563
00:58:39,028 --> 00:58:45,524
Memories are left behind.

564
00:58:46,035 --> 00:58:53,203
This is what the sky
says to the earth.

565
00:58:53,276 --> 00:58:59,909
This is what the sky
says to the earth.

566
00:58:59,983 --> 00:59:03,350
Sky to the earth.

567
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:10,084
Swami.

568
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:12,992
My Swami.

569
00:59:13,062 --> 00:59:16,657
My Swami.

570
00:59:17,033 --> 00:59:20,002
My Swami.

571
00:59:21,204 --> 00:59:28,303
Like the lamp and the wick.

572
00:59:28,411 --> 00:59:37,945
Like the monsoon breeze.

573
00:59:48,698 --> 00:59:55,160
Your and my union.

574
01:00:38,081 --> 01:00:40,106
Take this piece out.
- This <i>one. -  Yes.

575
01:00:42,151 --> 01:00:44,016
Swami.
- Yes.

576
01:00:44,087 --> 01:00:46,055
Your son works in a
multinational <i>bank...</i>

577
01:00:46,122 --> 01:00:48,352
<i>...what</i> is the need for
you to work now?

578
01:00:48,424 --> 01:00:51,757
My son says the same thing.
- What do you tell him?

579
01:00:52,028 --> 01:00:54,019
That manager sir says the
same thing everyday.

580
01:00:56,499 --> 01:00:57,693
How is Anand?

581
01:00:57,767 --> 01:01:00,759
Pooja!
- Anand! Anand!

582
01:01:02,038 --> 01:01:04,233
Good, I love you <i>so...</i>

583
01:01:05,308 --> 01:01:07,367
My heart is <i>true...</i>

584
01:01:08,311 --> 01:01:10,779
So, in love with <i>you...</i>

585
01:01:11,781 --> 01:01:14,045
Anand, did you read
todays Bombay Times?

586
01:01:14,117 --> 01:01:15,550
Why is there a important news?

587
01:01:15,618 --> 01:01:19,054
No, there a research
according to <i>which...</i>

588
01:01:19,122 --> 01:01:22,489
...those who get married at the
right time, they are happier.

589
01:01:23,192 --> 01:01:25,456
Okay. Thats nice.

590
01:01:25,528 --> 01:01:26,586
And guess what?
- What?

591
01:01:26,662 --> 01:01:27,788
My friend.
- Who?

592
01:01:27,864 --> 01:01:29,627
Rima.
- Rima.

593
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:31,326
Rima.
- Rima, Rima, Rima, <i>Rima...</i> Yes.

594
01:01:31,401 --> 01:01:34,564
She got <i>married. -  Wow,
that is a good news.

595
01:01:35,204 --> 01:01:37,069
By the way
what is the age of your friend?

596
01:01:37,273 --> 01:01:38,535
About my age.

597
01:01:39,575 --> 01:01:42,339
How lucky, she will
be happy all her life.

598
01:01:42,812 --> 01:01:44,143
She will be happy, isnt it?

599
01:01:44,213 --> 01:01:45,271
Yes, yes she will be happy.

600
01:01:45,348 --> 01:01:46,406
She will be happy, isnt it?

601
01:01:46,482 --> 01:01:49,417
Yes Pooja, they will be happy so?
- So?

602
01:01:49,585 --> 01:01:51,815
So what?
- So what.

603
01:01:51,888 --> 01:01:53,617
So what Pooja?

604
01:01:55,691 --> 01:01:58,421
So nothing, I am going.
- Where are you going?

605
01:01:58,494 --> 01:02:00,086
I am going to celebrate
the <i>happiness...</i>

606
01:02:00,163 --> 01:02:01,221
<i>...of</i> my friends marriage.

607
01:02:01,297 --> 01:02:03,390
By the way, I forgot to
tell you one thing Pooja.

608
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:05,225
Yesterday I was <i>thinking...</i>

609
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:07,826
<i>...why</i> dont I talk about
my marriage to my father.

610
01:02:11,274 --> 01:02:12,332
So then?

611
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:15,600
You were going somewhere?
- You were saying something.

612
01:02:15,678 --> 01:02:17,111
Me, what was I saying?

613
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,841
You were talking about marriage.

614
01:02:18,915 --> 01:02:20,212
I was talking about father.

615
01:02:20,283 --> 01:02:22,114
Tell <i>me. -  Okay madam, okay.

616
01:02:22,852 --> 01:02:25,548
I think about marriage
as much as you do.

617
01:02:25,788 --> 01:02:29,155
But what can I do, whenever
I talk about <i>marriage...</i>

618
01:02:29,225 --> 01:02:30,852
<i>...he</i> starts talking about America.

619
01:02:30,927 --> 01:02:32,690
When are you going to America?

620
01:02:32,762 --> 01:02:33,820
Have you made your passport or not?

621
01:02:34,297 --> 01:02:37,130
He wants to see the dreams
being <i>fulfilled...</i>

622
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,600
<i>...that</i> my mother had seen.

623
01:02:41,604 --> 01:02:42,866
You are right.

624
01:02:42,939 --> 01:02:45,874
You dont worry, your dream
will surely be <i>fulfilled...</i>

625
01:02:45,942 --> 01:02:47,807
<i>...and</i> all of us together
will go to America.

626
01:02:47,877 --> 01:02:50,607
Okay.
- Okay.

627
01:02:57,653 --> 01:02:59,746
Father, tea.

628
01:03:01,324 --> 01:03:03,349
Dont forget to take your
medicine after lunch.

629
01:03:03,426 --> 01:03:05,155
And please father

Father.

632
01:03:13,369 --> 01:03:16,395
Tea.
- What about the job in America?

633
01:03:16,806 --> 01:03:19,502

01:03:33,723 --> 01:03:36,191
Father is sitting besides me.

637
01:03:36,259 --> 01:03:37,726
Father is sitting besides me.

638
01:03:37,793 --> 01:03:38,851
We are meeting in the evening?
- Yes.

639
01:03:38,928 --> 01:03:41,897
We will <i>meet...</i> we will
meet in the evening. Ok bye.

640
01:03:46,269 --> 01:03:48,931
Come on father, I will
drop you at the shop.

641
01:03:49,005 --> 01:03:52,202
So soon, there is
still 2 hours left.

642
01:03:52,275 --> 01:03:53,765
Anyways, it takes 21/2 hours.

643
01:03:59,215 --> 01:04:01,877
Slow son, slow, slow.
- Yes father.

644
01:04:03,819 --> 01:04:06,515
Slowly, slowly, slowly.
- Yes father, yes.

645
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:09,221
Slowly.
- Father, we are going <i>slow...</i>

646
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:10,953
<i>...we</i> are travelling at 20.
- Then reduce it to 10.

647
01:04:11,027 --> 01:04:13,427
If I slow it down,
then it will stop.

648
01:04:13,563 --> 01:04:16,978
My cycle is better, it never stops.
- Yes father.
