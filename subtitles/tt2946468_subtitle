1
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,120
Yes, dude?
–Where is he? Is he inside?

2
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,520
Yes, mate, he is inside.
–Put the phone down.

3
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,600
Beyond this, there
is no point talking to me.

4
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,480
I built the house
as it was my dream house.

5
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,960
I can't give it up.
–Why must you give it up for me?

6
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,000
If you don't pay up in 2 days,
I'll take the money myself.

7
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,880
Even if you talk hours on end,
I won't understand anything.

8
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,200
The only lingo I speak
is money.

9
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,960
Talk using that lingo.
You can go now.

10
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,240
Priya, are you back? So fast?
–Yes, where are you?

11
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,840
I'm on my way. Of all days,
I don't see any auto around.

12
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,280
Look here, Priya, I'll be there.
Stay calm, okay?

13
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,320
Please don't give excuses,
come fast.

14
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,160
Come on! Come fast!

15
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,400
<i>Where will I look for money...</i>

16
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,960
<i>Where will I look for money...</i>

17
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,960
<i>Money is God,</i>
<i>he went hunting for God...</i>

18
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,840
<i>He flew to catch it...</i>

19
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,760
<i>Money can do wonders, he did</i>
<i>the craziest things for it...</i>

20
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,520
<i>Humanity took a backseat...</i>

21
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,320
<i>Time did not change anything...</i>

22
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,320
<i>No proper way of life...</i>

23
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,040
<i>I was always high...</i>

24
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,000
<i>Something did not make sense...</i>

25
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,040
<i>Girls fought among themselves...</i>

26
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,960
<i>No value for self–respect...</i>

27
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,720
<i>No place for human here...</i>

28
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,800
<i>No God to kill the Asuras...</i>

29
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,000
<i>When we have expectation...</i>

30
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,960
<i>We stop at nothing...</i>

31
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,920
<i>Where to look for justice...</i>

32
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,840
<i>If you have money,</i>
<i>you are a king...</i>

33
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,760
<i>People love money...</i>

34
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,480
<i>He thinks hard to save...</i>

35
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,400
<i>He inhales poisonous air...</i>

36
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,400
<i>He goes looking for death...</i>

37
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,600
<i>Money is God...</i>

38
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,000
<i>Money is God...</i>

39
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,720
<i>Money is God,</i>
<i>he went hunting for God...</i>

40
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,480
<i>He flew to catch it...</i>

41
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,680
<i>Money can do wonders, he did</i>
<i>the craziest things for it...</i>

42
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,560
<i>Humanity took a backseat...</i>

43
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,800
<i>Money is God...</i>

44
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,680
<i>Money is God...</i>

45
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,680
<i>Money is God...</i>

46
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,200
Come, friend.

47
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,280
They are Market Ravi's men.

48
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,240
Market Ravi?
What is he doing here?

49
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,600
Only God knows. They've been
here for the past 2 days.

50
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,320
Let them do whatever they want.
Let's mind our business.

51
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,400
Let's just stay focused
on our work.

52
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,360
It's brother. Vanakkam, brother.
–Salim, pass the phone to Thiru.

53
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,840
Sure. Hey!

54
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,160
Brother?
–What is this, Thiru?

55
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,320
You should have been more careful.
–I did it properly.

56
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,520
Don't know from where
the fool took a peak.

57
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,760
It's okay, I'll handle it.
Stay there for 2 days.

58
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,720
Don't come out till I tell you.
Don't do anything, okay?

59
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,120
Okay.
–Okay, pass the phone to Salim.

60
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,640
Hey, here!
–Yes?

61
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,760
Call Constable Velu.
He has the details of the witness.

62
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,600
Follow him and get him.
If you catch him, kill him.

63
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,920
If you can get him, kill our guy.
–Brother?

64
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,440
Brother?
–What else to do?

65
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,360
If the witness identifies him,
we'll be in trouble.

66
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,320
Then why waste time
following the other man?

67
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,240
He's right beside me,
I can do it right now.

68
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,680
Thiru is a loyal worker.
It's tough to get a man like him.

69
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,240
So, if he has the luck,
we'll get the other man.

70
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,800
Sir, you keep asking
the same question.

71
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,520
When can I go back?
–The officer is asking you.

72
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,520
Just answer him.
–I rushed towards the auto, sir.

73
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,920
The murderer got into the auto
with the bloody knife and took off.

74
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,920
When I checked, I realised
the victim was still alive.

75
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,360
So, I brought him in. Period.
Can I go now?

76
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
If you see the murderer,
can you identify him?

77
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,520
Yes, sir,
but I'm afraid to get involved.

78
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,480
You should have had the fear
before bringing the victim...

79
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,400
...to the hospital.
Get me?

80
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,600
Salim, where are you?
I'm coming.

81
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,680
There are many
stab wounds on the body.

82
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,440
Because he was drunk,
he had heavy blood loss.

83
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,400
We have done our best.
But we can't say anything...

84
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,840
...until we keep him
under observation for 48 hours.

85
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,600
Okay?

86
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,040
Madam, do you suspect anyone
in this incident?

87
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,080
Sir, can I go?
My friend is waiting for me.

88
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,920
Okay, you can go. Look here,
you can't leave the city.

89
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
I'll call you
at any time for enquiry.

90
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,000
Get me? Go on.
–Okay, sir.

91
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,720
Madam, that is the man who rescued
your husband and brought him...

92
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
...to the hospital.

93
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,400
Listen carefully, white shirt
with red checks.

94
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,880
That's the man.
Here he is.

95
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,160
You said white shirt
with red checks.

96
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,520
Yes, he just changed.
–Don't confuse me.

97
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,800
This is the man, right?
–Yes, handle it.

98
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,560
What happened, dude?

99
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,240
They killed me
with their questions.

100
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,320
Please don't ask me anything.
–Where do you want to go?

101
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,840
Go on, I'll tell you.

102
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,960
What happened?
–What am I to say?

103
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,880
She switched off her phone.
–Then your episode is over.

104
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,800
Come on!
–It is a delicate issue.

105
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,320
When you got delayed, she must
have cancelled her plans...

106
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,960
...to elope with you,
gone home and slept.

107
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,120
No matter what happens,
she would give me an earful...

108
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,960
...and not switch off her phone.
Something happened.

109
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,840
What could have happened?
–I don't know.

110
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,480
This is Entertainment Pandi.
In this Kali Yuga,...

111
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,440
...I'm the only one who feels
that no one should be a bachelor.

112
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,520
Seth, what's the matter?
Are you enjoying? Enjoy!

113
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,960
Excuse me, may I use
your phone for a minute?

114
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,640
Let me use first. One minute.
Seth, all my girls are sweet.

115
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,160
What? Operation failure?
No cooperation?

116
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,760
Look here, Seth, you are my friend.
But I can't refund your cash.

117
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,200
I've become decent only recently.
Don't turn me into a beast.

118
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,960
Dhana!
Dhana, why are driving?

119
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,560
Get in, I'll tell you.

120
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,160
What's in here?
–What's in here is not important.

121
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,800
How it is going to solve
your problem is important.

122
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,000
I have a confidential sim
in my cell phone...

123
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,600
...that no one can trace.
I'll forward all the information...

124
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,960
...in this pen drive
to a VIP through MMS.

125
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,640
10 minute after sending it,
contact the VIP...

126
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,120
...and tell him the original
video is with you.

127
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,560
Take whatever money
you need from him.

128
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,040
Make arrangements to collect
the money tomorrow morning.

129
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,600
You have to tell him where and
what time you want to meet him,...

130
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,560
...don't agree to whatever he says.
Do you get what I am saying?

131
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,200
Sir, I need a huge amount.
I bet you know that.

132
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,040
I know. With what is in here,
you can demand twice...

133
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,400
...the amount that you want.
Here you go.

134
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,640
Sir, what is in here?
–No, Vicky.

135
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,600
It's best you finish this deal
without knowing what is inside.

136
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,120
Another important thing.
Once you make this call,...

137
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,840
...you can't come out of it
till the deal is over.

138
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,600
What is it?

139
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,800
No, I trusted Akash so much.

140
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,200
But he cheated me.
I didn't trust you.

141
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,320
I didn't listen to you either.
But you are helping me.

142
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,000
Vicky, not only Akash,
even I will cheat you...

143
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
...when I get
the right opportunity.

144
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,800
You are solely responsible
for your present position.

145
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,840
Through this deal, you can solve
your problem for now.

146
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,840
Until you understand
your responsibility,...

147
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,480
...anyone can cheat you
at any point of time.

148
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,880
What the hell!

149
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,720
Mr. Mani, you don't seem
to understand.

150
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,280
What I'm saying is,
Vicky's place.....

151
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,960
Hello! Akash!
–Nothing, sir.

152
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,280
It was my sister.
Forget it, Mr. Mani.

153
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,800
I have already spoken
to Mr. Sathasivam.

154
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,480
I'm reminding you because
of the situation he is in now.

155
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,840
You got the property because of me.
Please don't forget that.

156
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,640
I've told you the share
due to me once the deal is over.

157
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,600
Just adhere.....
–Akash, you keep repeating...

158
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,640
...what you have already said.
If Sathasivam said so,...

159
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,920
...it will take place.

160
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,960
Don't worry, Durga,
nothing will happen to him.

161
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,360
How can you be so sure?

162
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,640
Has he done
that much of good deeds?

163
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,720
If he survives, I wonder how many
lives he is going to destroy.

164
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,040
Instead, let him die here.

165
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,200
What are you saying, Durga?

166
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,320
The man lying
in there is your husband.

167
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,280
Whose husband? Because my father
couldn't repay the debt...

168
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,200
...he took from this man,
he forced me to marry him.

169
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,960
How can I think of him
as my husband?

170
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,360
Did he call you indecently
to sleep with him for a night?

171
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,400
He invited the town,
arranged a feast for them and...

172
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,720
...married you in front of them.
–So? Must I live happily with him?

173
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,200
If I want to live happily,
he must die here.

174
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,080
I know you will talk
in support of him.

175
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,240
I'm not obliged
to listen to you.

176
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,400
Hello!
–What happened?

177
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,520
I said I'll call you.
–They need the money urgently.

178
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Tell them I'll come
with the money. Okay?

179
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,800
Sure.

180
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,920
This is Guna.
His child is in the hospital.

181
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,720
Scheduled for a surgery tomorrow,
he needs to pay by today.

182
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,840
He has come for help too.

183
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,960
I have no money,
but I know where it is.

184
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,800
I know how to get it too.

185
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,080
If you come, we can get
the money immediately.

186
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,600
What are you saying?
What to take? Where to take?

187
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,640
I don't get it.
–We need to rob.

188
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,200
You need money, he needs money.
I need money too.

189
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,520
I know where
to get the money we want.

190
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,880
If we take it,
all our problems will be solved.

191
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,760
I'm a professor.
–We are police officers.

192
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,880
We don't have a choice.
Do you have another option?

193
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,720
If you have, go ahead.

194
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,640
You came here because
you didn't have any other option.

195
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,320
This is the only way.
If you are agree, tell us.

196
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,120
Priya is thinking that
I will conduct her wedding well.

197
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,240
Her happiness is important to me.
I'm prepared to do anything for it.

198
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,480
My father is ready
to do anything for me.

199
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,560
I lied to him and
stood there waiting for you.

200
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,720
What is wrong with you, Priya?
I'm telling you,...

201
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,760
...a man was fighting for his life.
My only intention was to save him.

202
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,920
What about me?
I was standing on the road alone.

203
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,120
What do you want me to do now?
Do you want to elope? Let's go.

204
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,480
What for? No need?
I've decided to go home.

205
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,000
I'll go home and marry the man
my father has chosen for me.

206
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,840
At least I'll earn a good name.
–So, the decision...

207
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,680
...to elope with me is wrong.
–Yes, I made a mistake.

208
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,040
I fell in love with you and decided
to marry you despite the fact...

209
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,320
...that my father hates you.
–Fine, you can go.

210
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,840
I wish you all the best.
–I can't go just like that.

211
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,680
What do you want then?
–I want my bag back.

212
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,480
I can't go home without it.
–Why?

213
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,720
Because my family necklace which
my mother gave me is in the bag.

214
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,720
If I go home without it, my family
will poison my food and kill me.

215
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,080
Okay, what should I do now?
–Find my bag for me.

216
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,040
Did you hear that?
For her to marry a fool,...

217
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,880
...I must go all over town
and look for her bag.

218
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,920
How do I look?
–It's because of you I lost my bag.

219
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,160
Look, I'm only responsible
for my bag.

220
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,800
It is here.
You are responsible for you bag.

221
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,680
Get me?
–God! Can you both calm down?

222
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,440
What?
–Come here.

223
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,520
Why are you fighting with her?
–I'm telling her clearly.

224
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,720
But she is laying down
her condition.

225
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,480
Forget it. She is tensed
as she ran away from home.

226
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,160
She also got scared
after seeing those robbers.

227
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,720
You tell me,
do you want her or not?

228
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,280
I don't want her.
–She may be a fool,...

229
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,560
...if you miss her, you won't find
someone like her again.

230
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,640
You are right.
–Then listen to me.

231
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,200
Go and help her.
–Where am I to find...

232
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,560
...those robbers in this big city?
–You won't find them.

233
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,280
You won't find the bag either.
–Then how?

234
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,880
That is why I am asking you
to find for it.

235
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,480
Try to convince her
while looking for her bag.

236
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,520
Why did you decide to help me
all of a sudden?

237
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,440
What am I to say?
–Please spare me.

238
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,440
Look, I'm not responsible
for your bag.

239
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,200
But you brought it because of me.
So, I'm offering to help you.

240
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,440
Okay, come on,
let's lodge a police report.

241
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,280
Why? Do you think I can't do that?
I don't want that.

242
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,840
That is why I am you for help.
–Why not?

243
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,840
This area's police inspector
is my father's close friend.

244
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,240
If I go there,
my father will come to know.

245
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,520
Then where to look for them?
–I know where they would be.

246
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,400
What? You know? But how?

247
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,000
A man point a knife at me
this morning.

248
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,240
The fool next to him
said this all of a sudden.

249
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,760
Come to Kundi Thoppu and ask the
people about Senthil and Palani.

250
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,080
Then you'll know who we are.

251
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,920
Why don't you give our address too?
Go and start the vehicle.

252
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,920
After we leave,
you must forget everything.

253
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,040
You have to.
If you don't, I'll stab you.

254
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Agree?

255
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,680
What's that in your hand?
Give it to me!

256
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Keep walking
without looking back.

257
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,960
Kundi Thoppu, if we go there,
we can catch them.

258
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,000
Fine, they would have
sold everything by now?

259
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,360
Okay! They wait with the bag
as they know we'll be coming...

260
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,320
...without selling anything.
Happy?

261
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,560
<i>Drinks that you love...</i>

262
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,080
<i>There is</i>
<i>a little intoxication in it...</i>

263
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,120
<i>Because there is</i>
<i>intoxication in it...</i>

264
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,440
<i>Arguments will occur...</i>

265
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,440
<i>It will give a good name...</i>

266
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,360
<i>It will pretend</i>
<i>like a monkey...</i>

267
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,480
<i>At dawn...</i>

268
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,400
<i>You won't feel</i>
<i>drunk anymore...</i>

269
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,520
<i>Dull girl</i>
<i>is playing hard to get...</i>

270
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,600
<i>I'm unable to win</i>
<i>that dull girl...</i>

271
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,440
<i>Glasses enhance of looks</i>
<i>for now...</i>

272
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,680
<i>It is going to ensure that we have</i>
<i>a tough time later on...</i>

273
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,920
<i>Koovam is a river too,</i>
<i>but can we swim in it...</i>

274
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,080
<i>Love intoxicates too,</i>
<i>but can it be like booze...</i>

275
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,600
<i>If I pass out drunk,</i>
<i>my wisdom will shine bright...</i>

276
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,840
<i>Why...</i>

277
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,960
<i>Dull girl</i>
<i>is playing hard to get...</i>

278
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,480
<i>I'm unable to win</i>
<i>that dull girl...</i>

279
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,160
<i>Glasses enhance of looks</i>
<i>for now...</i>

280
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,600
<i>It is going to ensure that we have</i>
<i>a tough time later on...</i>

281
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,520
<i>Why...</i>

282
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,800
<i>Why...</i>

283
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,080
<i>If you buy a sari from Pothys</i>
<i>and make your love grow...</i>

284
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,240
<i>Even if you buy</i>
<i>a Samsung or Nokia...</i>

285
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,280
<i>Even if you hang out</i>
<i>together all the time...</i>

286
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,320
<i>Even if you propose</i>
<i>and make out...</i>

287
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,320
<i>Love is just</i>
<i>a past–time for women...</i>

288
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,480
<i>If you ignore it,</i>
<i>your life will be good...</i>

289
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,880
<i>Why...</i>

290
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,840
<i>Why...</i>

291
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,600
<i>I'll smack you</i>
<i>of you talk ill about love...</i>

292
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
<i>If you had met an angel,</i>
<i>you would understand...</i>

293
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,080
<i>Love won't hurt an empty heart...</i>

294
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,920
<i>Even a child know that only rubbish</i>
<i>gets collected in it...</i>

295
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,120
<i>Why...</i>

296
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,480
<i>Why...</i>

297
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,640
<i>Why...</i>

298
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,800
<i>Why...</i>

299
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,760
<i>Do you want butterflies</i>
<i>in your heart...</i>

300
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,600
<i>Do you want to be successful...</i>

301
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,560
<i>You want a girl like Anushka...</i>

302
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,680
<i>If you are like Hanuman,</i>
<i>you will never fall in love...</i>

303
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,720
<i>Booze will only make you drunk</i>
<i>for a while, it's not like love...</i>

304
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,640
<i>You can achieve with love,</i>
<i>so fall in love...</i>

305
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,480
<i>Why...</i>

306
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,880
<i>Why...</i>

307
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,280
<i>Love that starts at Coffee–Day</i>
<i>ends in the Tasmac...</i>

308
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,200
<i>Only if you have money,</i>
<i>love opens its eye...</i>

309
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,400
<i>Even if Anushka appears before me,</i>
<i>I don't need her...</i>

310
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,080
<i>If I sleep for half a day,</i>
<i>she'll come on her own...</i>

311
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,520
<i>She'll appear in my dream...</i>

312
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,360
<i>Why...</i>

313
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,080
<i>Why...</i>

314
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,720
<i>Like the blue sky...</i>

315
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,800
<i>God gave love too...</i>

316
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,480
<i>All the boons that you are supposed</i>
<i>to receive will vanish...</i>

317
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,680
<i>Only love will stay</i>
<i>till the end...</i>

318
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,800
<i>Just like love,</i>
<i>Tasmac is great too...</i>

319
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,000
<i>I'm telling you,</i>
<i>listen to me...</i>

320
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,320
<i>Devadas taught us both...</i>

321
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,320
<i>Before him, you are dummies...</i>

322
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,440
<i>Why...</i>

323
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,640
<i>Why...</i>

324
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,440
<i>Why...</i>

325
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,800
Listen, whatever we steal,
we spend it in government shops.

326
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,960
We are martyrs.
They should erect a statue for us.

327
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,520
Senthil!
–Sir, good morning.

328
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,200
How are you?
–I'm good. What do I lack?

329
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,600
What's up?
–I need a favour from you.

330
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,080
What job, sir?
–I need a vehicle urgently.

331
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,240
Sir, I left that a long time ago.
Can't do that.

332
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,640
Trying to be funny with me?
I'll pay you.

333
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,800
I know you will.
–This is not the same.

334
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,640
Do the job well this time.
–Okay, don't be moved.

335
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,080
When do you want it?
–The job is tomorrow morning.

336
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,800
Deliver the car by tonight.
–You make it sound so easy.

337
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,160
Today is not possible.
–You can do it, I know.

338
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,120
Come with the vehicle, I'll tell
you what the plan is.

339
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,760
Okay, sir.

340
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,680
Rubbish, what a living!
–You'll say this.

341
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,400
Then you'll do the work he says.
Shameless man!

342
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,640
I'll go and meet the doctor.....
–Tell the doctor...

343
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,640
...you'll pay up by tomorrow.
Ask him to start the surgery.

344
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,800
Go on.

345
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,920
Why are you upset? Don't think
about what would happen tomorrow.

346
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,680
If we do that, what would happen.
Just think of that.

347
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,440
Be cool.

348
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,040
I think the man I wanted to meet
is here. This is his car.

349
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,120
Let me go and meet him.

350
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,800
You are angry with Sathasivam.
It's not fair to be upset with me.

351
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,520
Please take it.
I won't talk about him, happy?

352
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,880
You hate him.
Then why did you come here?

353
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,040
Why are you sitting
here for hours?

354
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,280
I'm serious. You may go,
I'll look after him.

355
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,120
It's okay, I'll stay here.
I'll stay and get the results.

356
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,920
I'm telling you
I'll pay you tomorrow.

357
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,480
I'll get the money tomorrow,
I've made the arrangements.

358
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,400
Come on, sister.
–If anything happens...

359
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,320
...to my child by then, you had it.
–Sir, come on.

360
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,960
Let me go. Do you know who I am
Police sub–inspector.

361
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,040
I'm under suspension, that is
why I'm suffering this fate.

362
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,840
I'll take charge soon.
I'll handle you then,...

363
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,920
...I won't let anyone go.
–Don't be angry.

364
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,760
Keep quiet.
The child's surgery must go on.

365
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,880
Let's go.
–Or I won't let anyone go.

366
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,040
Sir, don't be tensed.
I won't tell anyone about this.

367
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,680
What do you want?

368
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,440
The property that you have.
–Which property?

369
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,520
Vicky's property.
–Do you know what you're saying?

370
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,400
Do you know the value
of that property?

371
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,600
I know very well.
I'm not asking it for free.

372
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,920
Tell me it's cost.
I'm ready to pay you.

373
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,480
Ready? How will you pay me?
–That's none of your business.

374
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,440
Get the documents ready tomorrow.
I'll come with the money.

375
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,720
But I've agreed
to sell it to Lawrence,...

376
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,040
...I even collected an advance.
–Return the money back to him.

377
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,640
Close the deal.
Must I teach you these things?

378
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,280
If Lawrence doesn't get it,
he'll go to any extent.

379
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,880
He must stood down.
I am down there.

380
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,080
Don't worry about him.

381
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,880
This has been my dream.
If I let this opportunity go,...

382
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,360
...I won't get a better chance.
Get me this deal.

383
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,920
Sir!
–Sorry, brother, very sorry.

384
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,640
Hey! You can speed,
but don't drive recklessly.

385
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,560
At least when I'm going
to see my lover,...

386
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,640
...I can drive myself.

387
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,080
Only you would praise your guy.
–What's wrong with you?

388
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,440
I like him, so I praise him.
–Dhanam, no matter what I say,...

389
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,640
...you don't seem to get it.
He is not a nice guy.

390
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,080
He would do anything for money,
be careful.

391
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,920
So, can't I love?

392
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,560
Dhanam, I know how
you started this profession.

393
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,520
Entertainment.
We don't know what made him...

394
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,480
...choose this profession,
and become a thug.

395
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,160
I don't know
if I will live with him.

396
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,240
But he is not a bad guy.
I have faith in him.

397
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,840
Hey! What are you doing here?

398
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,120
I came to talk
politics with you.

399
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,680
Why, aren't you free?
–How do you know I'm here?

400
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,920
Maybe the police
don't know you are here.

401
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,440
But I have good connections.

402
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:33,120
Eat slowly. You are going
to get choked to death.

403
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,400
What is it? I've been calling you
for a long time.

404
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,480
Okay, I've answered. What's up?
–How long to wait with the stuff?

405
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,800
Okay, you want me
to inform him, right?

406
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,760
I'll tell him.

407
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,880
Why are you guys following us?
Dismissed!

408
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,920
Ravi called. Everything is ready.
He is waiting for you.

409
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,760
Really?
–He is a smart boy.

410
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,120
Tell him we'll be there by tonight?
–We? You go on your own.

411
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,520
Where are you going?
–I'm not coming, you go on.

412
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,160
Where are you going?
–Where will I go? Home.

413
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,400
I have work, I'll finish that.....
–Listen, I have imported liquor.

414
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,840
Come and drink. Let's go.
–Even if I go to Kasi,...

415
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,280
...fate will not let me go.
Nothing, get in, we'll go now.

416
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,800
Boss likes you very much.
Wherever he goes,...

417
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,560
...you must tag along.
You are great.

418
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,240
Hey! Trying to be funny with me?
What do you know?

419
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,240
I won't tell anyone if he errs,
that is the only reason.

420
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,880
Sundarajan, who is this?

421
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,960
Someone is messing with me
without knowing who I am.

422
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,360
I will surely kill him.

423
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,560
It's Ravi who is calling?
–What does he want?

424
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,160
Can't he wait?
–Okay, I'll talk to him.

425
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,040
Here, talk.
–Hello!

426
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Did you see the MMS I sent to you?
–It's him.

427
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,840
Put him on speaker.
–I have the original video...

428
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,400
...of the clip you saw.
I'm ready to give it to you.

429
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,640
But only if you give me
the amount I ask for.

430
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,680
How much?
–Rs3 crores.

431
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,840
Tell him I'll give him
–Okay, when and where?

432
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,720
Tomorrow at 10.30 am,
the park along Mount Road.

433
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,360
Come alone with the money.
–But that's a busy place.

434
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,760
That is why I picked the place.
Get me?

435
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,120
Loud and clear.

436
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,960
Why did you come here?

437
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,640
Why aren't you responding
to my calls?

438
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,640
Don't you know why?
–I told you, didn't I?

439
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm not involved
in what my brother did to you.

440
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,880
It's not fair to ignore me
because of what he did.

441
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,400
Nanditha, please go.
–I won't go, Vicky.

442
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,480
I'll stay here.
–Enough of your concern.

443
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,360
That is why I'm facing this now.
–Okay, like you said,...

444
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,240
...let me be the cause
of this problem.

445
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,240
But now, the onus
is also on me to solve it.

446
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,640
No matter what you say,
I won't leave.

447
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,080
I genuinely care about you.
Don't make it a mockery.

448
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:55,000
Forget about the anger you have
on me, focus on your program today.

449
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,960
Whose number are you using
to call me?

450
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,280
No, dad, this is
my friend's number.

451
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,880
My phone has run out of battery.
–Did Swetha's wedding go on well?

452
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,440
Yes, it went on well.
I met my friends here.

453
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,080
They want me to treat them
for my wedding.

454
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm going to take them for dinner.
I'll be a little late. Is it okay?

455
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,720
Okay, but be careful.
–Dad!

456
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,920
What is it?
–The wedding will go on well.

457
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,960
So, relax. Bye.
–Sure.

458
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,440
So, you don't plan
to give me a second chance?

459
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,480
Please, don't say anything
and confuse me.

460
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,240
I'm not confusing you, Priya.
You are confused.

461
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,480
If this morning,
a man did not attack another,...

462
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,280
...I would have come on time.
If I had come on time,...

463
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,160
...we would have eloped.
If we had eloped,...

464
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,560
...we would be married by now.
If we were married,...

465
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,960
...would you be confused?
–Did your plan backfire?

466
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,360
Brother, just concentrate
on the road.

467
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,320
We sort out our problem.
–I see hundreds of people...

468
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,480
...like you daily.
That is why I am saying.

469
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,040
Hey, good–for–nothing!
Your job is to drive. Just do that.

470
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,120
How dare! What did you say?
Be respectful.

471
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,840
He think he is a big fish
and we have to respect him.

472
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,600
How can she talk that way?
–Am I too much?

473
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,200
Your job is to drive. Why get
involved in people's problem?

474
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,120
Hey, wait!

475
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,000
Why is she hitting me?
Is she crazy?

476
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:43,440
Crazy? Who is crazy?
You and your family are crazy!

477
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,720
Oh God!
–Don't look, help!

478
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,240
Priya, keep quiet!

479
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,440
This is a girl.
–Where are you going? Here!

480
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,600
Let me go!

481
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,200
Are you a girl? Devil!
Even my wife did not hit me...

482
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,120
...with a slipper.
–If I come there, you'll die.

483
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,680
Why should I die?
The man who marries you is a goner.

484
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,160
What?
–Sir, you look like a good man.

485
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,640
Can you find someone better?
You'd better get away from her!

486
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,040
Run for your life first.
–Go!

487
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,920
Leave her!

488
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,800
Keep going!

489
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,760
You've chased away our ride.
How are we to go now?

490
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,720
Do you want us to go in his car?
He spoke ill about me. Useless!

491
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,120
He spoke ill about you.
You don't go.

492
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,040
Why can't I take his ride? Auto!
–Yes, sir?

493
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,320
Kundi Thoppu,
can you take us there?

494
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,760
Sure, get in.

495
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,160
He'll take us, get in.

496
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,640
That's him, Kathir!
–Why did she come here?

497
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,400
Hey!

498
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,760
Give me your phone.
–What for?

499
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,360
Give!
–Here!

500
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,800
Fool, why are you
taking my picture?

501
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,200
Why are you taking
his picture in our area?

502
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,360
It's nothing.
–Hey!

503
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,160
What?
–I'll do what I want.

504
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,120
Mind your business.
–Don't pick on him.

505
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,160
If I do, what will he do?
–Why pick on me in my area?

506
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,400
He has come! Will you pick
on us in my brother's area?

507
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,960
Give me the phone.
–She's a little girl. Let her go.

508
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,560
Who is a little girl?
–Is that important? Must you know?

509
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:13,320
Brother, give me my phone.
–Okay, I'll keep the phone. Go!

510
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,920
Take her with you.
–Hey!

511
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,120
Please keep quiet!
It is a Rs20,000 phone.

512
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,920
I only paid Rs6,000 for it.
I have to pay its instalment.

513
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,200
Please give it back to me.
–Get lost!

514
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,720
He has a knife!
–Come on, Kathir!

515
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,600
Careful.

516
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,560
It's a bad area.
What are you doing here?

517
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,040
You can tell me if you like.
I may help you.

518
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,320
2 men stole her bag.
–Great.

519
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,440
How do you know they are there?
–They are there.

520
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,080
I saw one of them there.
He ran upon seeing me.

521
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,680
Did he see you too?
No point looking there anymore.

522
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,800
They would have escaped by now.
Don't worry.

523
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,320
Can you identify him?
How does he look?

524
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,680
One minute.
Give me your phone.

525
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,880
It's him.

526
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,520
I know him, it's Senthil.
He's from this area, I know him.

527
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,640
Do you know
where he would be right now?

528
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,240
We can catch him wherever he is.
–Mad guy!

529
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,600
So, she came. So what?
–Don't, I'll get angry.

530
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,800
Will you get angry
if I say something?

531
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,960
What is it?
–You can never be a good thief.

532
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,000
Tell me I'm not a good man,
I'll agree.

533
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,280
But don't say I'm not a good thief.
–Let me go.

534
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,800
We spent all our money.
What are we going to do now?

535
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,040
Who said we have no money?

536
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,680
Look.
–Where did you get this from?

537
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,440
It was in the girl's bag
that we took this morning.

538
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,800
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
–I know what you would have done.

539
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,920
What would I have done?
–You would have gifted it...

540
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,680
...to Dhanalakshmi.

541
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,560
Why are you smiling?
–Right.

542
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,600
Where is Dhanalakshmi?
I want to see her right now.

543
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,400
I can't see her now.
She's with a customer.

544
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,600
Once she is done, I'll speak
to her and let you know.

545
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,040
Call me no matter
how long it takes.

546
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,080
Okay.

547
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,400
I wonder what she sees in him.

548
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,680
I want to get married
and settle down.

549
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,520
What for?
–Can't I get married?

550
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,960
Be my guest.

551
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,600
Marry anyone your like.
But you must come when I call you.

552
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,320
You will come.

553
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,280
I won't go to anyone
after marriage.

554
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,040
It will only be with my husband.

555
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,040
You can do something.

556
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,040
Marry me. Then I'll be
with you all the time.

557
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,200
Go!

558
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,040
Why? Are you angry?

559
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,440
Are you saying I should not fall
in love and get married?

560
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,480
Hey, pick up the money
and give me in my hand.

561
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,640
What do you think of me?
Am I begging you?

562
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,240
How can you throw the money
on my face? Pick it up!

563
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,480
Here! Go!
–I'll go!

564
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,280
Did I come here to start
a family with you?

565
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,320
Fine, yes, I liked you.

566
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,600
But no.

567
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,440
How will you accept me
as a wife?

568
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,720
You won't, right?

569
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,600
What do you know about me?
Thousands are queuing up for me.

570
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,080
My fate, I like you.

571
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,200
Why? Because you're an angel?

572
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:48,080
You make a living
by torturing people.

573
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,200
I entertaining people
for a living.

574
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,840
No matter how you look at it,
I'm much better than you.

575
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,880
Bear that in mind.

576
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:09,600
Dhana, why are you leaving so fast?
Do you have another client waiting?

577
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,400
Move!
–Wait!

578
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,200
Why are you upset?
I'll pay you twice the amount.

579
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,760
Don't!
–Hey!

580
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,240
She is refusing, leave her alone.
–Just mind your business.

581
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,280
You're pointing your hand!

582
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,680
What?

583
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,960
I told you clearly
not to come here.

584
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,600
Brother, they are new. They picked
on you as they don't know you.

585
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,120
You can go, madam.

586
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,920
He is Brother Thiru.
He's a tiger.

587
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,440
Take him away!

588
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,280
Drink, brother.

589
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,280
Drink.

590
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,200
What happened? You look tired.
And your face looks bad.

591
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,040
What did he say?
–He is not a good man.

592
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,360
He is someone who would do
anything for money.

593
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,520
Pity him, Dhanam. We don't know
what made him become a rogue.

594
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,040
Don't, I'm already angry.

595
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,920
Don't be angry,
tell me what happened.

596
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,960
He refused to marry me, happy?
–Is that all?

597
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,080
What is this, Dhanam? Forget about
the man who doesn't love you,...

598
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,760
...think about the man
who is crazy about you.

599
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,520
I mean Senthil.
He called, he wants to see you..

600
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,760
God, let me go, I can't.
–What is this, Dhanam?

601
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,200
He'll keep you beside him
and say a few love poems.

602
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,640
What is the problem?
–That is why I don't want.

603
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,680
Pity him, I don't want
to give him false hopes.

604
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,080
Dhanam, in our business,
we must not consider...

605
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,520
...if an action
is sinful or a good deed.

606
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,480
He knows this will not come true.
That is why he is coming after you.

607
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,320
Even your rich clients do not give
you expensive gifts, but he does.

608
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,280
Just listen to him
for a few minutes.

609
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,800
Hey!
–Collection officer is here.

610
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,880
You do not come to the station
or take care of me.

611
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,960
No work over there, brother.

612
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,480
Here.

613
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,760
Is your problem solved?

614
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,680
You can only look.
–Take care of me often.

615
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,520
Sure.
–Who is it?

616
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,600
The ICU patient has passed away.

617
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,800
I don't want any explanation.
It is absolutely ridiculous.

618
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,720
You were with him,
you're saying you did not notice.

619
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,920
Sorry, sir.
–Doctor, what happened?

620
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,440
How are you related to the patient?
–I'm his friend.

621
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:38,000
Okay, nothing to worry. Did anyone
go in to see the patient?

622
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,000
Yes, doctor, I went in. Why?
–Nothing.

623
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,720
Try not to go in
as far as possible.

624
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,840
Even if you go in, don't touch
the patient or anything around him.

625
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,360
Understood?
–Okay.

626
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:59,800
Sister, what happened?
–His medicine flow got obstructed.

627
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,880
How?
–Someone shut the valve.

628
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,040
Who could have done it?
–Don't know.

629
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,200
Someone must have one it,
or it could have closed on its own.

630
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,760
The doctor is yelling because
he feels we were careless.

631
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,760
<i>Time to enjoy...</i>

632
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,640
<i>Where is it heading too...</i>

633
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,440
<i>Heart which will</i>
<i>withstand anything...</i>

634
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,240
<i>It breaks...</i>

635
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,600
<i>Anything that changes</i>
<i>is not true...</i>

636
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,280
<i>Those with scars</i>
<i>will not change...</i>

637
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,280
<i>The circle that you see</i>
<i>when love blinds you...</i>

638
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,520
<i>It is gone</i>
<i>when the blindfold is removed...</i>

639
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,080
<i>If pain becomes a language...</i>

640
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,760
<i>If darkness is light...</i>

641
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,440
<i>If this is the only way...</i>

642
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,680
<i>We will travel</i>
<i>as long as the path takes us...</i>

643
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:28,840
<i>Let's have fun...</i>

644
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:35,080
<i>Let's have fun...</i>

645
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,840
<i>A bud that is crushed</i>
<i>can still bloom...</i>

646
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,560
<i>It is crushed by a force...</i>

647
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,320
<i>An instrument that is broken</i>
<i>can still produce sound...</i>

648
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,880
<i>The damage will not affect it...</i>

649
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,720
<i>The people see something else...</i>

650
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,360
<i>I see something else...</i>

651
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,200
<i>My love will not change...</i>

652
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,960
<i>Look at me, girl...</i>

653
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,880
<i>Anything that changes</i>
<i>is not true...</i>

654
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,360
<i>Those with scars</i>
<i>will not change...</i>

655
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,320
<i>The circle that you see</i>
<i>when love blinds you...</i>

656
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,680
<i>It is gone</i>
<i>when the blindfold is removed...</i>

657
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,880
<i>Let's have fun...</i>

658
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,120
<i>Let's have fun...</i>

659
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,320
<i>Let's have fun...</i>

660
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,280
<i>Colours all around us...</i>

661
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,160
<i>The sky as far</i>
<i>as the eye could see...</i>

662
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,840
<i>Without you,</i>
<i>there is not me...</i>

663
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:26,920
<i>Can we fly</i>
<i>with one set of wings...</i>

664
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,840
<i>The colour of the sky...</i>

665
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,040
<i>I see a different tone...</i>

666
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,800
<i>Won't you change your mind...</i>

667
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,400
<i>What else am I asking for...</i>

668
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,960
<i>Anything that changes</i>
<i>is not true...</i>

669
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,760
<i>Those with scars</i>
<i>will not change...</i>

670
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,680
<i>The circle that you see</i>
<i>when love blinds you...</i>

671
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,680
<i>It is gone</i>
<i>when the blindfold is removed...</i>

672
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,000
<i>If pain becomes a language...</i>

673
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,920
<i>If darkness is light...</i>

674
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,880
<i>If this is the only way...</i>

675
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,280
<i>We will travel</i>
<i>as long as the path takes us...</i>

676
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,120
<i>Let's have fun...</i>

677
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,000
<i>Let's have fun...</i>

678
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,480
Are you on nights?
Me too.

679
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,160
It looks costly.
–Why do you look at those things?

680
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,240
Do you like it? Wear it, Dhanam.
It'll look nice on you.

681
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,680
Really?
–Why are you asking like that?

682
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,200
What do you lack?
Everything will look good on you.

683
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,120
Senthil, I want
to leave everything...

684
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,960
...and get married.

685
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,200
What do you think about it?

686
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,720
Why? Can't I get married?
–What do you lack, Dhanam?

687
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,720
You can get married.

688
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,360
No, keep this
as my wedding gift to you.

689
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,160
Do you love me that much?

690
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,800
Tell me, Senthil.

691
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:56,560
Then fine.
Will you marry me?

692
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,160
Stop the car!
–What is it?

693
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,800
Stop!

694
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,840
Go on, I'll come on my own.
–Okay.

695
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,880
What is your problem?
Why do you keep following me?

696
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,000
What? Are you worried
I'll kill him?

697
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,120
Mom!

698
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,480
I've apologised to you.
Then why are you doing this?

699
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,400
Dude, Dhanam asked
if I'd like to marry her.

700
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,120
Look.

701
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,840
What I do is bad.
–What is this?

702
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,160
But you'll do anything.
–The fight is serious.

703
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,040
That's his car.

704
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,000
I'll go and start the car.
Push our bike aside and join me.

705
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,960
When did you plan it?
–When you were proposing...

706
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:59,000
...to the filth.
You said I look like a fool.

707
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,800
This is a master plan.
–Just go!

708
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:10,520
Mom, help me! Mom!

709
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,440
Brother, let me go!

710
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,840
I want to go home.
I want to see my mother.

711
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,120
I'm scared, brother.

712
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,480
Let's go.
–Let me go.

713
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,160
Vicky, please don't do this.
–God!

714
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,240
Who left the horn here?

715
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,520
Hey!

716
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,160
Get going!

717
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,880
Let me go!

718
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,080
Vicky!

719
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,960
Let me see.

720
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,720
Stop!

721
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,840
Stop the car.

722
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,680
Palani!
–Stop!

723
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,040
I think he saw the thief.

724
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,640
Why? What happened?

725
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:26,560
He is not going to catch the thief.
He is just acting.

726
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,680
How do you know?
–I'm not lying, madam.

727
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,840
He does not plan
to catch the thief.

728
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:35,160
Did he say so to you?
–Why must he tell me?

729
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,280
When you weren't around,
he was telling someone.

730
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,480
Get in! Who is he?

731
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,720
Let me go!

732
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:55,200
Tell me the truth.
Do you think I turned off the drip?

733
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,960
No, that's not what I think.
I won't even think that way.

734
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,000
Because it was me
who turned it off.

735
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,760
I sent the men
to kill him yesterday.

736
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,840
Today, I tried
to murder him again.

737
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,040
I'm scared, brother.

738
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,080
Why are you watching?

739
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:23,280
Let me go please!

740
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,920
It seems there is something
important in your bag.

741
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,280
If you find it, you'll marry
someone else. Is that true?

742
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:56,680
He's not going to find the bag.
I know where the thief will be now.

743
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,680
If you have faith in me,
come with me.

744
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:02,840
I swear I'll catch the thief
for you. Have faith in me.

745
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,320
Hey!

746
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,440
Stop!
–Let me go!

747
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,280
Who are you? Why are you after me?
–You stole the girl's bag.

748
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,720
Where is the bag?
–Let me go.

749
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,320
Why is he fighting here?

750
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,520
Let's go!

751
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,520
You want him to die.
Nothing wrong in that.

752
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:52,600
He should die. We couldn't see
eye to eye in business.

753
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,880
For you, in life.

754
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,280
If he dies,
both our problems will end.

755
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:03,120
So do us a favour.
Kill him.

756
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,200
Don't worry, they have
given us 48 hours.

757
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:11,480
If anything happens by then,
it will seem like natural death.

758
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,040
If things go out of hand,
I'll handle it.

759
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,720
Vicky, let's go and lodge
a police report first.

760
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,520
We can't go to the police.
–Why not?

761
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,440
There is a bag in the car with
something that can't reach...

762
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,480
...the police.
–What is it?

763
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,880
Tell me, Vicky.

764
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,800
Hello, Nanditha!

765
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:15,400
Vicky, listen to me.
It's good we lost it.

766
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,880
We don't need the money.
What you earned and saved,...

767
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,880
...everything is gone.
That's all, right? Let it go.

768
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
We are only going to fall down,
but we won't die.

769
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:33,400
We'll earn
what we want hereafter, okay?

770
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:42,400
What are you thinking?
Do you want him to die or not?

771
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:49,120
Okay, go on.
I'll handle it.

772
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,560
Priya!

773
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:11,480
Look how the old man
is guarding the entrance.

774
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:16,800
If I walk in with this, he'll take
it and keep it in his safe.

775
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,040
So you keep this for now.

776
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,840
Dhanam, Senthil is a good man.

777
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,680
If you become his wife,
you'll have a good life.

778
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:35,560
You know how much I like her.
She is asking me to marry her.

779
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,600
How can I say no?
You tell me.

780
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,320
I didn't say anything.
–I know you are upset.

781
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,200
You know, right?
Shut up and work then.

782
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,640
Fine, I'll be glad
if you are happy with her.

783
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,920
Looks like he thrashed you.
–Even the car's owner...

784
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:58,000
...did not hit me so hard.
But that guy fixed me good.

785
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,440
What happened?
–I don't know.

786
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,520
She was with me all along.
She left all of a sudden.

787
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,760
Who is it? Priya?
–Her father.

788
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:13,360
Professor?
Why is he calling you?

789
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,080
She called him once from my phone
when we were together.

790
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,920
Great.
–Say something to him.

791
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:22,320
He'll recognise my voice.
–Yeah, you answered...

792
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,760
...all his questions in class.
So he knows your voice.

793
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,840
Talk to him.
–Hello!

794
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,880
I'm Priya's father.
–Yes, sir?

795
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,240
Can you pass the phone to Priya?
–She is not here right now.

796
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,880
Not here? Where is she then?
–I don't know. But don't worry.

797
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,680
I'll reach her and
ask her to talk to you.

798
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:48,040
Sure. Your name please?
–Sir, my name is Sasi.

799
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,320
Okay.
–Why did you say my name?

800
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,640
He hates me.
–Why? Does he like me?

801
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,680
Forget it, I could
only remember your name.

802
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:01,480
I bet. Instead of sleeping at home,
I came when you called.

803
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,040
I bet you'll remember only my name
and not anyone else.

804
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,400
Forget it, don't be tensed.
–You're supposed to be tensed.

805
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:09,280
Your lover is missing.
–I'm not tensed.

806
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,680
Nothing will happen to her. I hope
she doesn't cause harm to others.

807
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,720
Pity the auto man.

808
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,200
What happened?
Where are we now?

809
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:41,080
Enough, how long are you
going to pretend?

810
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:45,320
Why? What happened?

811
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,760
What is this?

812
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,720
People are saying
you're a brave man.

813
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,040
Are you really that Sathasivam?

814
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:02,320
I don't even raise
my voice in front of you.

815
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,560
Are you afraid of me?

816
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:16,000
Are you saying
I can't do anything?

817
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:27,440
5 minutes,
everything will be over. Okay?

818
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:14,080
Why are you looking, dude?
Don't know who she is?

819
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,880
The witness
who saw you attack the man,...

820
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,440
...it's his girl.
He took off.

821
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:26,240
He'll come looking for her.
We'll get him then. Okay?

822
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,000
What? Did you get scared?

823
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,480
You're no God like you think you
are, you're just an ordinary man.

824
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:43,280
Even the greatest man
will end up like this one day.

825
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,400
No one can prevent it
from happening.

826
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,120
But there is something
that can be prevented.

827
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:54,800
You need to earn bonds who will cry
for us at a time like this.

828
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,400
Do you have someone like that?
If you survive,...

829
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,360
...do you have someone
will be happy for you?

830
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,320
No one? Then.....

831
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,120
Escape, Velu.

832
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:31,160
What was that?

833
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,000
Did something sting me?

834
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,840
Coffee.

835
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,920
What happened?

836
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:01,520
I built this house with love.
–Vicky, I know you love this place.

837
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,320
Yes, and I will miss it.

838
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:10,600
Okay, I've made arrangements
for us to rent an apartment.

839
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,840
We'll know that by tomorrow.

840
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,480
I've lodged a report
that the car was stolen.

841
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,000
I said no.
–Don't worry, Vicky.

842
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,240
The inspector
is my friend's brother.

843
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,040
If we do not lodge a report because
of the pen drive in the car,...

844
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:29,960
...what if the robbers use it
for some criminal activities?

845
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,880
We'll be in a bigger soup.
Get me?

846
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,480
I've also listed down everything
that you need to do today.

847
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,520
You have done so much work
in the morning itself.

848
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,480
Yes, you need not worry
about anything.

849
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,440
I am here for you.
–What shall we do now?

850
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,720
I don't know.
I thought she'll come home.

851
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,400
But there has been 25 miss calls
from her father till now.

852
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:55,160
I don't know where she went.

853
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:02,240
Who is it? The professor?
–No, it's another number.

854
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,680
Answer, Priya could be calling
from another number.

855
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,520
Hello!
–This is the inspector...

856
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,960
...from K2 Station.
–Police.

857
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,840
Police?
–Hello!

858
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:16,680
Yes, sir.
–Are you Sasi?

859
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,680
Priya's father has lodged
a report that his daughter...

860
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,440
...has been missing
since yesterday.

861
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,640
I need to question you
regarding the case.

862
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,400
Come to K2
Police Station immediately.

863
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,240
You must come immediately.
–Okay, sir.

864
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,040
What happened?
–Get ready.

865
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,640
We need to go
to the police station.

866
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,760
We? You need to go.
This is your problem.

867
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:40,920
Why should I come along?
–Whether I go or not,...

868
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,120
...you have to be there.
They have actually called you.

869
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:48,000
What for? Why?
–The professor lodged...

870
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,840
...the missing person's report
using your name.

871
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,240
Why?
–Because I gave your name.

872
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,840
Get ready, dude, we have to go.

873
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,480
Did I fall asleep here?

874
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:15,120
Where is the patient who was here?
–We moved him to another ward...

875
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,240
...in the morning itself.
–Which ward?

876
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:24,640
Do you think I'm a bad man?
–There is nothing to think.

877
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,680
You are a terrible person.
I know for sure.

878
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,560
Not only to me, you've sinned
to many people numerous times.

879
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,960
You know that too.

880
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:39,840
You're a despicable man who would
do anything to line your pocket.

881
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:44,520
Can you deny it?
–Why don't you kill me then?

882
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,520
Why are you letting me go?

883
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,000
You won't get
a better chance than this.

884
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,560
Just because my father
didn't have money,...

885
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:57,000
...you used that weakness
to married me.

886
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,800
But the same man taught me
that it's shameful to use...

887
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:03,480
...a man's weakness
to defeat him.

888
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:08,080
I believe in it.
So I won't harm you here.

889
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,800
Once you recover and come home,
if I could do anything to you,...

890
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:17,400
...I would do it happily.
You can rest peacefully for now.

891
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,560
God!
–Hey!

892
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:28,640
I know you're not here to stay
guard, but to spy on us.

893
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:35,320
You'd better go.
I injected you yesterday.

894
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,880
Today, I'll stab you there.
Get me?

895
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,160
Hey! Tell Manikandan
he doesn't have to come here.

896
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,040
If he comes,
I'll gather the town.

897
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,160
Not this way,
it's that way.

898
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:55,320
What are you saying?
–She made me doze off.

899
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,560
What?
–Sathasivam's wife.

900
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,520
If I stay here any longer,
my life will be in danger.

901
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,360
I'm leaving, sir.
One more important news.

902
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,760
He said you should not come here.
If you do, she said...

903
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,920
...she'll gather the town
and humiliate you.

904
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,400
She looks good, right?
–Hey!

905
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,480
Tell me the truth.
Why did you bring her here?

906
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,800
What is it, dude?
I told you, didn't I?

907
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:32,040
Don't you trust me?

908
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:45,680
Brother, Kathir escaped.
So I came back to the lodge.

909
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:50,360
Thiru is here. Shall I kill him?
–Forget about Kathir and Thiru.

910
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,360
Go to the hospital.
Sathasivam has survived.

911
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,240
He should not leave
the hospital alive.

912
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,720
Kill him right there.
–Okay.

913
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:07,560
The man you attacked has survived.
I'll go and get rid of him.

914
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:12,080
Stay here till I get back.
Let her stay here too, okay?

915
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:17,560
If she wakes up by then,
don't talk to her.

916
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:21,360
She'll talk and convince you.
–What?

917
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,880
Anything, dude.
She's a lady.

918
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,600
Hello!
–What is this? You told us...

919
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,400
...to come to the park
in Mount Road, but you're going...

920
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,760
...to Egmore with a girl.
–How did you get this number?

921
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,280
That is not important.
The video clip is important to us.

922
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,640
Can you give it to us?
I know the clip is with you.

923
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,080
Not only that,
I know where you live,...

924
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,400
...what you do,
where you're going now,...

925
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:07,360
...I know everything.
A car is following you right now.

926
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,200
What is it, Vicky?
–Don't change the plan,...

927
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,680
...give them the stuff.

928
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,880
They'll leave you
once you give them the stuff.

929
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,600
If you don't give them,
they'll take the clip themselves.

930
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,320
So, get it done
and over with.

931
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:04,480
Hey! Who are you?

932
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:10,960
Why did you tie me up here?
Hello!

933
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,920
What do you want?

934
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:22,080
If you yell,
I'll stab you with this. Get me?

935
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,880
I'm not going to harm you.
Let your lover boy come here.

936
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,760
Then I'll let you go.

937
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,800
I don't get it.
–You need not understand anything.

938
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,000
Just shut up.

939
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,000
Look here, sir,
a mistake has happened.

940
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,480
The person I love is called Kathir.
He works in a call centre.

941
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,960
He's not one
who would look for trouble.

942
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:59,080
You have caught me my mistake.
–Did he see something...

943
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:02,520
...that he shouldn't have seen
yesterday morning?

944
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,880
Yes, sir.
He saw someone attacking a man.

945
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
He took the man to the hospital
and informed the police too.

946
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:15,720
We did not make a mistake then.
He saw what he shouldn't have seen.

947
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,520
He rescued a man
whom he shouldn't have rescued.

948
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:23,200
And he even went to the police.
There is nothing left to do.

949
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:27,080
Let him come.
Till then.....

950
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,480
If you had caught me
just to catch Kathir,...

951
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,840
...why did the auto man kidnap me
by telling me not to trust him?

952
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,920
How will Kathir come here
if he doesn't know I'm here?

953
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:49,640
<i>If she wakes up before that,</i>
<i>she'll talk and convince you.</i>

954
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:54,400
<i>What?</i>
<i>–Anything, dude. She's a lady.</i>

955
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,600
Who is Sasi?
<i>–Traitor.</i>

956
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:07,000
Wait outside, I'll call you later.
–No, sir, I'll wait here.

957
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,600
Pity him, he hasn't been
to a police station.

958
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:15,680
She he is afraid.
–He has told you. Go!

959
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:29,080
Professor.
–You did not see her thereafter.

960
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,120
I swear, sir.

961
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Hello.
–We are here.

962
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,160
Okay, I'm coming.

963
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,320
Sir?
–Hold him till I get back.

964
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,360
Get in! Look where
he is standing in his uniform.

965
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,840
What happened?
Any news about Priya?

966
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,560
She is safe,
she is with her friends. Get in.

967
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,960
How do you know?
–I was asking her friend.

968
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:05,320
She is safe.
Get into the car.

969
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,120
He's good. Let him
rest here for a week.

970
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:17,400
Once a medication cycle is over,
you can take him home, okay?

971
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:35,760
You need not believe what I say,
but I'll still tell you.

972
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:40,160
The job I do,
the wicked things I do,...

973
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:43,600
...I never regretted them.

974
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,520
I only did
what I thought was right.

975
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,040
I had another nature.

976
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:53,760
But that is called selfishness,
I realised that only after...

977
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,520
...you told me.

978
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:00,720
The same way, I liked you.

979
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:06,480
I spoke to your father.
He agreed.

980
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,960
I married and brought you back.

981
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:15,040
But when you smiled just now,
I realised that...

982
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:18,480
...you never smiled
as long as we were together.

983
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:26,160
Okay, don't think about anything,
please sleep.

984
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,720
We'll sort out everything later.

985
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,520
He's on the 3rd floor, B Ward.
He worries about him.

986
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:39,920
He is still weak. But you must
be careful with his wife.

987
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,280
She is dangerous,
she'll make you suffer.

988
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,280
Really?
–I've experienced it.

989
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,000
We'll see.
–That's it.

990
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:53,280
Yes, dude?
–Hey, showing me your colour?

991
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,640
What happened?
–Am I your procurer?

992
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:01,320
Dude, I told you
not to talk to the girl.

993
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,880
Salim.
–Now you found out I lied to you.

994
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,560
You do not listen to me.....
–Look, Sathasivam's wife.

995
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:14,960
Dude, don't be angry.
You need not be a procurer.

996
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:19,400
Just drop it. I'll handle it.
–Come, I'll show you.

997
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:33,280
I told you to sit
down quietly for some time.

998
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,960
What's your problem?
–What could be my problem?

999
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,960
You are right,
Salim lied to me.

1000
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:46,560
He brought you here
for another reason.

1001
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:50,480
You'd better leave
before he comes. Go on!

1002
01:22:55,680 --> 01:23:00,520
Hey! Tell your lover
to leave town for some time...

1003
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,880
...and not get spotted by us
or the police. Go!

1004
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,880
Mom!

1005
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,040
That's the house.
Do you remember what I said?

1006
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:43,400
You only have 20 minutes. Come back
to the car no matter what happens.

1007
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:45,640
Your daughter's wedding
depends on this.

1008
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,240
Don't botch it.
–We're from income tax department.

1009
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:53,000
Palani, get their mobiles.
–Give me your phone!

1010
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,520
Go and sit.

1011
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,600
Give me your cell phone.

1012
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,240
Who are you?
–Income tax department.

1013
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:03,800
Please come down, sir.

1014
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,360
It's good
if you cooperate with us, okay?

1015
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:09,360
Take him down.

1016
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,160
Keep an eye on him.
–Okay.

1017
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,160
Palani!

1018
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:33,920
<i>I'm under suspension now,</i>
<i>that's why I'm suffering this fate.</i>

1019
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:37,640
<i>I'll take charge soon.</i>
<i>I won't let anyone go.</i>

1020
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,200
<i>He is under suspension.</i>

1021
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,080
They are cheats.

1022
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:45,480
Wait here, I'll be right back.

1023
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:51,920
Where is he?
–God! He was there.

1024
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,480
Fool!

1025
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,400
Where is your husband?

1026
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:01,200
Keep an eye on her.

1027
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,760
Is this enough
for your daughter's wedding?

1028
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:14,040
You doing this
despite knowing about me?

1029
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,640
Put it back inside.

1030
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,280
There goes
your daughter's wedding.

1031
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,840
What happened?
–Kill him!

1032
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,800
Sheila!

1033
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,920
Is it you?

1034
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,720
Sir!

1035
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,240
Gopi!

1036
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,280
Get in!

1037
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,640
This is the best place to lose
the people who are following us.

1038
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:49,920
And then? They know
everything about us.

1039
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:53,240
I don't think they'll let us go
until we give them to pen drive.

1040
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,360
I think we should go
to the police.

1041
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:56,920
I think we are taking
risk for nothing.

1042
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:00,000
It's not that easy.
We don't know his influence.

1043
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:03,880
And we need to know how involved
is Mr. Sulaiman in this.

1044
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,440
Mr. Sulaiman!

1045
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:11,240
Akil! Don't cry, Akil!

1046
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:14,400
What happened to your dad?

1047
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:19,800
What? 3 men?

1048
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,360
They are over there.
–Catch them.

1049
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:27,480
Okay, look after your dad.
–What happened?

1050
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:37,640
Vicky, nothing will happen to him.

1051
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,680
Get down.

1052
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,040
Where is the pen drive?
–Pen drive.....

1053
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:50,880
No, I can't die
for your stupid plan

1054
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,760
You need not say anything.
I know what to do.

1055
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,840
The pen drive you're looking for
is not with us now.

1056
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:01,520
But I know who has it.
If you come with us,...

1057
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:05,360
...I'll give it to you.
Please leave me after that.

1058
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,520
Carefully lift him.

1059
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,040
Get into the car.
–Don't we have to admit him?

1060
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:21,040
They'll handle it.
Come on!

1061
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:28,120
If we leave him like that,
what about his child's surgery?

1062
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,520
What about your friend's
daughter's wedding?

1063
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:32,600
We came counting on you,
what about our share?

1064
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:36,760
You just drove off.
–I didn't come here for anyone.

1065
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:40,240
I came here for myself.
I need not worry about the rest.

1066
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,720
My daughter is getting married
in the morning.

1067
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,240
I got down into this
as I needed money for her wedding.

1068
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,800
I made a mistake, I shouldn't have
listened to Parasuraman.

1069
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,400
He said it's a normal theft,
he killed everyone.

1070
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:05,240
Now I don't even have the money.
I've only become a murderer.

1071
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,840
Nothing will happen, sir.
Why are you tensed?

1072
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:13,160
How can I not be tensed?
Parasuraman cheated me.

1073
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:19,120
And my daughter too.
She left yesterday morning.

1074
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,280
She has not returned.

1075
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:25,320
Parasuraman said she is safe
in her friend's house.

1076
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,680
When I call her now, she doesn't
want to answer her phone.

1077
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,640
I thought I'll go straight
to the police station.

1078
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,320
He said he was questioning
someone there.

1079
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:38,880
Sir, be patient. We'll find
your daughter wherever she is.

1080
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,320
Don't you and your lover have
better work to do?

1081
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,240
Why get involved in things
that doesn't concern you?

1082
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,960
Just mind your business.
–Do you know the girl is there?

1083
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:51,640
I do. So what?

1084
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,640
You had the heart to release me,
you should have had the heart...

1085
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:58,440
...to help the girl too.
–Are you saying I made a mistake?

1086
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,040
If you will only pity
one person per day,...

1087
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,680
...let it be that girl then.

1088
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:12,600
Get up!

1089
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,360
I won't feel proud
that I released you...

1090
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:20,920
...or regret for not helping
the girl. Get me? Go!

1091
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:26,640
I'll go. But if I leave,
it's only with that girl.

1092
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,320
They are terrible guys.

1093
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:31,760
That's my problem.
I'll handle it.

1094
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,200
Lock your door
and stay safe indoors.

1095
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,200
Hey!

1096
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,680
Dispose the car.

1097
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:58,680
The door is open.

1098
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,240
Who are you?
–I'm Das, Lawrence's brother.

1099
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,680
Buying and selling land
is our family profession.

1100
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:34,240
If you mess with that,
do you think we'll keep quiet?

1101
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:38,680
 Yes, constable
–Salim, where are you?

1102
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:41,920
At the tea shop opposite
the hospital. Tell me.

1103
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:45,560
Okay, I want you to leave.
–But my job isn't over.

1104
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:48,240
No need to do anything,
someone killed Mani.

1105
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,080
What are you saying?
Who did that?

1106
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:53,600
I'll tell you first
when I get more details.

1107
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:55,320
I want you to leave now.

1108
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:02,200
So what if they shoot Manikandan?

1109
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:14,240
Who is that?

1110
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:18,640
What is it?
–Someone was standing there.

1111
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,920
There is no one here.
I told you to sleep peacefully.

1112
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:40,680
I think what you said is true.
It is giving me the creeps.

1113
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:46,000
I'm not lying,
I was busy making money,...

1114
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:48,480
...I didn't have time
to think about anything else.

1115
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:54,200
Now that I'm lying here,
I have time to think.

1116
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,480
Everything is wrong.

1117
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:03,360
But what can I do now?
I can't undo my mistakes.

1118
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:08,840
Yes, you can.
If you know you have erred,...

1119
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,800
...as atonement,
you can do some good deeds.

1120
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,320
Atonement.

1121
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:19,360
What should I do? Tell me.

1122
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:23,160
Give up the money
that you earned wrongfully.

1123
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:29,080
Right now, in this hospital,
many people need money.

1124
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:32,360
Help at least a few.

1125
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:39,760
Call the office and ask someone
to get my chequebook.

1126
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:44,800
What are you looking?

1127
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,800
Call them.

1128
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,680
Yes?

1129
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,640
Really? Confirmed?

1130
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:15,880
Okay, I'll bring her.

1131
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:21,280
What? Are you bored?
It's okay.

1132
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:27,040
Soon I'll take you to an uncle.
If you do what he says,...

1133
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:30,880
...I'll send you home later.
Okay?

1134
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,880
Good girl.

1135
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:03,920
Let me go!

1136
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:07,440
Let me go!

1137
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:10,560
I'm telling you to let me go.

1138
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:16,160
Come on.

1139
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:26,600
Excuse me.

1140
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:31,360
What are you doing here?
Who are they?

1141
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:35,240
They want what you took from Vicky.
Please give it to them.

1142
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:39,600
What? What do they want.
–They are terrible people.

1143
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:42,600
It's only smart to give
without a problem.

1144
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:48,440
Hey, why should I give
the minute you ask?

1145
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:55,080
What is this? Let me go.
–What's happening?

1146
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,200
Come on!
–Come fast!

1147
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,480
Hey!

1148
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,880
They smacked him good.

1149
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:27,320
I got him his share.
He deserves it.

1150
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,080
There is a call
from the police station.

1151
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:47,240
They took everything from the car,
including the bag...

1152
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,280
...with the pen drive.

1153
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:52,120
Where am I to look for it?

1154
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:56,960
What? Money isn't ready?
Then it is risky.

1155
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:01,160
What are you saying?
–She had pizza, burger,..

1156
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:04,600
...apple juice and
grew up like a queen.

1157
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:09,480
If you will only give her bread,
let me know now.

1158
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,520
Come over here.

1159
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:19,600
Drink.

1160
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:24,600
Look, money is not a problem.
We couldn't get it on time.

1161
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:27,920
That's the problem.
We'll get it if we try elsewhere.

1162
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:32,600
We need to work hard.
How can you say things like that...

1163
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:35,040
...and disappoint him. Is it fair?
–It's not that, Palani.

1164
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,360
You and Senthil
are important to me.

1165
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:42,520
But Dhanalakshmi believes in me.
She agreed after I spoke to her.

1166
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,160
Do you know how much
she believes in me?

1167
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:47,080
How much?
–Hold this.

1168
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:52,880
<i>I must get it.</i>
–Senthil gave her.

1169
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:57,320
She told me to keep it safely.
Dhanalakshmi believes in me.

1170
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:00,800
I didn't expect you
to get so emotional.

1171
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:05,440
Finish this.
I have the money already.

1172
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:08,760
I am drunk.
Don't you have to get drunk?

1173
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:12,800
You must. I'll go
and get a full bottle.

1174
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:16,640
He'll ask for money.
Drink this! Country fellow!

1175
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:37,640
What happened?
–Akash who is supposed to marry...

1176
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:42,720
...Priya tomorrow is hospitalised.
–Hospital? What happened?

1177
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,760
Someone went into his office
and smacked him.

1178
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,000
I wonder what other news
I'll be getting.

1179
01:38:55,760 --> 01:39:01,120
Hello! Guna!
Where are you?

1180
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:04,360
Sorry, sir, I didn't know
how to tell my wife.

1181
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,720
That is why I called you.
–No problem.

1182
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:11,000
Forget it, let's do
what is necessary.

1183
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:14,480
What more can happen?
Where am I to go for cash...

1184
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:17,680
...for my son's surgery?
–I didn't pay...

1185
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,720
...for your son's surgery.
My husband did it.

1186
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:22,800
He is very sick
in this same hospital.

1187
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:27,720
I only want you
to pray for him.

1188
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:42,040
What happened?

1189
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:46,880
Kamala, I couldn't look
for money for our son's surgery.

1190
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:49,720
I tried my best.

1191
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:06,880
One, please.

1192
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,280
Vanakkam, sir.
What are you doing here?

1193
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:17,720
Where did you go before
I could come back to the auto?

1194
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:20,600
Madam told me to leave,
that is why I left.

1195
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:23,000
What?
–Yes, sir.

1196
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:25,080
It seems
you were pretending to help.

1197
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:27,000
I didn't say so,
those were madam's words.

1198
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:30,040
She said you were planning for her
wedding to be called off...

1199
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:33,080
...by not finding her necklace.
Forget it, sir.

1200
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:38,000
Girls are like this.
–Fine, where did you drop her?

1201
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:41,240
The same place
where we went in the morning.

1202
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:44,520
What happened there?
–I don't know.

1203
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,640
I dropped her and left.

1204
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:54,120
You didn't see her after that?
–I just told you that.

1205
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:02,120
Something is wrong.
I botched it when I tried...

1206
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:06,440
...to raise money for the wedding,
I went out to rob,...

1207
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:10,440
...my daughter, Priya,
is still not back home,...

1208
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:13,800
...the groom got hurt
and he is lying in the hospital,...

1209
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,800
...there is a reason for this.

1210
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:19,840
Or this wouldn't happen
to my daughter.

1211
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:24,920
Or maybe she's against
this marriage,...

1212
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:28,080
...she could be staying
at her friend's place.

1213
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:31,280
Talking about friends,
that reminds me.

1214
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:41,920
Hello!

1215
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,960
Sleep, I'll go and arrange
for the money.

1216
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:00,000
What are you going to do?
–I'll sell this and get some money.

1217
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:03,280
That bag?
You won't get anything for that.

1218
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:06,720
I'll make something.
I have to feed her, don't I?

1219
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:10,440
Right, I'll come with you.
–Why are you coming?

1220
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:14,680
You'll go out, must I stay here?
I'll come with you.

1221
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:17,720
What are you saying?

1222
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:25,760
You can't make anything
from this.

1223
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:29,000
I'll keep her happy.

1224
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:33,760
But in haste, I swore to her
that I won't steal anymore.

1225
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:38,560
So what now? You want money,
but you must not steal.

1226
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:42,880
I have an idea. If I tell you,
you must not get angry.

1227
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:47,720
Why would I get angry? Tell me.
–Give me the bag.

1228
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,840
What for?
–Give, I'll tell you.

1229
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:51,360
Fool!

1230
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:55,960
Oh my God! Run, Palani!
–Catch me if you can.

1231
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,840
Stop!

1232
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:02,440
Stop! Where are you running?

1233
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,320
Not me!
–Where is the girl?

1234
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:09,240
Girl? Which girl?
–Don't pretend.

1235
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,040
The girl who came looking
for you yesterday. Where is he?

1236
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:13,280
Sir, I swear,
I didn't see her after that.

1237
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:16,200
Tell me the truth.
–Trust me, I don't know.

1238
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,560
Okay, where is the necklace
that was in the bag?

1239
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:24,320
Sir, this is a question.

1240
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:29,320
But I won't answer you.
–Hey!

1241
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:31,680
Stop!

1242
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:34,880
Move!

1243
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:39,600
Stop!

1244
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:46,720
Get lost!

1245
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:57,000
The necklace is in there.
Eat it.

1246
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:58,920
What is happening here?

1247
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:07,040
There is nothing here.
–Fool, he messed up my shirt.

1248
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:09,840
Where did you go?
–I didn't go anywhere.

1249
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:13,240
I was standing right next to you.
You ran when you saw him.

1250
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,800
Why did you run?
–Don't ask.

1251
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:19,440
He has been chasing me
since yesterday.

1252
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,040
But why?
–I stole the necklace...

1253
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:28,120
...and gave Dhanam. He wants it.
–Where is the bag?

1254
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,560
He kept chasing me.
I threw the bag at him...

1255
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,520
...and told him
the necklace is in it.

1256
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:38,720
What is it?

1257
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:55,280
What is this?

1258
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:03,280
Vikram.

1259
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:17,160
Show me.
–Thank God. Got it!

1260
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:20,920
Vicky, one minute.

1261
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:25,960
Hey!

1262
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,880
Thanks, dude.
That was a great help.

1263
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,840
It's okay.

1264
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,560
Hello.
–I'm Sasi's mother.

1265
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:50,800
What is it, aunty?
–Is Sasi with you?

1266
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:53,840
No.
–He left his mobile at home.

1267
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:56,840
He left this morning,
he still hasn't returned.

1268
01:45:57,280 --> 01:46:01,320
Hey, don't you have conscience?
I came with you.

1269
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:05,680
Is this how you ditch him?
–No, our professor.....

1270
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:08,200
I followed him.
–Give me my bike key.

1271
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:12,760
I told you about my friend, right?
He's the one.

1272
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:16,000
Hey!
–Goodbye to bad rubbish!

1273
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:19,320
Hey!

1274
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:31,080
This is the auto driver.

1275
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:41,080
Sit, what is your name?
–Don't touch me, let me go.

1276
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:43,280
Nothing will happen,
don't be scared.

1277
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:47,440
Get lost! Let me go!

1278
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:50,640
I'm telling you nothing
will happen to you.

1279
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:06,360
Come.

1280
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:09,600
Take a seat.

1281
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:12,360
Hey, pour.

1282
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,480
The job is done.
So we are leaving.

1283
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:21,680
Before you go, shall we play?
–Sure.

1284
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:34,080
There is a beauty inside,
do you want to see her?

1285
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:38,240
Hey!
–Brother?

1286
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:45,560
Hey, come on!
–Get lost!

1287
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:50,120
Sit!

1288
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:03,160
Let's play.
If you win, we'll leave her here.

1289
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:08,400
But if I win,
I'll take her. Okay?

1290
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:16,520
No matter where you are today,
you'll become our briyani.

1291
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:21,720
Come alone to the place I said
at 10 midnight with the money.

1292
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,280
Alone.

1293
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:30,400
Vicky, do you think
he will come alone?

1294
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:33,000
Definitely not.
–Then why look for trouble?

1295
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:37,240
Let's give it to the police.
–If we do, will he be punished.

1296
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:41,800
Will the girl get justice?
–So, what will you do?

1297
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:47,480
Here.

1298
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:58,600
Who are you?

1299
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:02,200
What do you want?
–I came to kill your husband.

1300
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:06,120
If you are silent,
I'll kill him quietly and leave.

1301
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:11,360
Look, if you are doing this
for money,...

1302
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:16,200
...I'll give you more.

1303
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:24,000
I have lots of money,
by God's grace.

1304
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:26,800
Then what do you want?
Ask, I'll give.

1305
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:33,720
Once, please.

1306
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:40,160
When I saw you,
I don't know what happened to me.

1307
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,800
Do you read me?

1308
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,440
If you agree, then it's fine.

1309
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,480
Or your husband.....

1310
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:03,720
What is it?
You said you're going to run away.

1311
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:08,520
Why are you getting dressed?
–Yes, I'm going to run.

1312
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:15,800
But before that,
for the people who like me,...

1313
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:18,320
...one last dance for them.

1314
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:04,760
<i>This chariot that moves</i>
<i>is a golden chariot...</i>

1315
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:10,560
<i>I'm the glittering queen at night,</i>
<i>have fun...</i>

1316
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:13,120
<i>I'm like toddy that</i>
<i>is out of this world...</i>

1317
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:15,560
<i>Drink as it is</i>
<i>of superior quality...</i>

1318
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:18,040
<i>I'm like toddy that</i>
<i>is out of this world...</i>

1319
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:21,000
<i>Drink as it is</i>
<i>of superior quality...</i>

1320
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:26,200
<i>I'm coming to seduce</i>
<i>all of you...</i>

1321
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:31,440
<i>This chariot that moves</i>
<i>is a golden chariot...</i>

1322
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:36,680
<i>I'm the glittering queen at night,</i>
<i>have fun...</i>

1323
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:05,680
<i>This is the normal practice,</i>
<i>why hesitate...</i>

1324
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:08,320
<i>Seduction continues...</i>

1325
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:13,280
<i>Excitement spreads all over...</i>

1326
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:16,400
<i>I'm like a honey comb</i>
<i>in the middle of the forest...</i>

1327
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:24,400
<i>You can harvest the honey...</i>

1328
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:29,360
<i>Come on...</i>

1329
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:34,120
<i>This chariot that moves</i>
<i>is a golden chariot...</i>

1330
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:39,840
<i>I'm the glittering queen at night,</i>
<i>have fun...</i>

1331
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:11,120
<i>This closeness between us will last</i>
<i>till the excitement is over...</i>

1332
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:16,480
<i>We can have fun till dawn...</i>

1333
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:19,360
<i>The stars will wink at us...</i>

1334
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:21,920
<i>It cheers us...</i>

1335
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:24,600
<i>The stars will wink at us...</i>

1336
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:27,480
<i>It cheers us...</i>

1337
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:32,360
<i>Let's not go wrong...</i>

1338
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:54,640
You will look after me, right?
–Definitely.

1339
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:58,120
Will you stop stealing
and go to work?

1340
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:03,200
Why do you asking?
–For fun.

1341
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:07,320
Fine, before we leave,
there is something to be done.

1342
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:11,200
Tell me what it is.
I'll do anything for you.

1343
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:16,840
You must steal one last time,
for my sake.

1344
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:49,040
Take her to the vehicle.
–One more game. Sit.

1345
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:55,320
You have a copy, right? Why?
–Because I won't need it.

1346
01:54:55,440 --> 01:55:00,520
This thing will end here today.
What am I going to do with a copy?

1347
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:06,560
Right, we'll end
this here today.

1348
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:15,840
I hit the jackpot.
I won't steal.

1349
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:20,520
My mother's. I got it back.

1350
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:34,480
You said only one game.
–I said I will leave her here...

1351
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:38,480
...only if I win.
So, I'm going to play till I win.

1352
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:43,680
Not only this girl,
leave the other girl too. Agree?

1353
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:59,120
You!

1354
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:02,920
Where is my Priya?
What did you do to her?

1355
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:09,080
You want to cut or shall I?
–I'll do it.

1356
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:58,000
Senthil, come!
–They are taking something.

1357
01:57:58,120 --> 01:57:59,920
Catch them.

1358
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:13,280
Catch them!

1359
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:45,960
Let go!

1360
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:51,000
Let go!

1361
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:56,000
Come fast!

1362
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:03,240
Let's go.
–Hurry!

1363
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:07,480
Catch them!
–Hurry!

1364
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:09,880
Come on!

1365
02:00:20,440 --> 02:00:22,720
Hey!

1366
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:31,840
There is no one else here.
It's only you and me.

1367
02:00:32,120 --> 02:00:34,280
No, we are here too.

1368
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:41,400
Sundarajah, I underestimated you.
–You thought I was a fool, right?

1369
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:45,560
I'm your loyalist. But.....

1370
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:48,240
Go, dear.

1371
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:50,560
I have a daughter
who is 14 years old.

1372
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:58,120
Let me go.
I will not harm you.

1373
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:04,200
You won't harm me. But you'll ruin
the lives of young girls.

1374
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:06,480
You can keep the pen drive.
I'll give you double the amount...

1375
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:09,360
...you asked for.

1376
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:11,520
Give it to the police
and get me into trouble.

1377
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:15,120
If I go to the police,
you'll get away.

1378
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:19,120
No, please.
–What about the little girl?

1379
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:23,160
Therefore.....

1380
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:28,800
I told you
I won't need it anymore.

1381
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:52,560
Brother!

1382
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:17,560
How much?
–Friend, sad he's leaving you?

1383
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:22,240
No, sister.
He has no money.

1384
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:25,920
I don't know
where you'll go and do what.

1385
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:31,640
I don't know what we will do.

1386
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:37,040
But what we have been doing
all this while,...

1387
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:39,880
...we will never do that.

1388
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,920
You called me sister.

1389
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:45,880
Did you ever feel like
calling me that way before?

1390
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:50,320
You only thought of my rate.
–No.

1391
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:53,880
Then why did you
call me that way?

1392
02:03:57,160 --> 02:03:59,280
Because I am going to live
with your friend, right?

1393
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:05,400
I want that.
I want only that.

1394
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:07,360
We'll handle the rest later.

1395
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:11,200
Hey!

1396
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:16,120
Congratulations. You are right.
You're a lucky man.

1397
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:27,520
I'm ready to start
a new life tomorrow.

1398
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:31,880
I'm glad I did not take money
for this deal.

1399
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:38,000
When I saved your husband
yesterday, I lost my lover.

1400
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:42,120
Now I saved you,
my girl left me for good.

1401
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:45,160
Where did she go?
–I don't know.

1402
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:48,960
The only guy who knew met
with an accident outside and died.

1403
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:54,040
He behave this way to you,
I wonder what he did to my Priya.

1404
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:59,440
Nothing would have happened to her.
Just watch,...

1405
02:04:59,560 --> 02:05:02,160
...she'll come
and stand in front of you.

1406
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:10,720
Doctor, please help.

1407
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:21,600
Priya!

1408
02:05:26,280 --> 02:05:28,360
Where did you go?

1409
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:12,520
Your wedding should go on.
Here you go.

1410
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:16,080
Why are you upset? Aren't you
in favour of this marriage?

1411
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:21,840
Your wedding will go on
as planned in the morning.

1412
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:23,480
But the groom will be someone else?
–Who will it be?

1413
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:27,600
How would I know?
But the professor knows.

1414
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:30,600
Wait!

1415
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:32,680
Here, talk to him.

1416
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:38,400
Dad!

1417
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:56,560
Durga, that's another thing
that I should give up.

1418
02:06:56,680 --> 02:07:01,680
The boy is suffering because of it.
His number is behind the paper.

1419
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:07,320
Call and tell him right now that
his property is only for him.

1420
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:14,720
Hello, Vicky.
