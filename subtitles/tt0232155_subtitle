Oh Lord,
you are the highest authority

You solve the problems
of one and all

14
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:51,810
You are the protector
of those that have gone astray

15
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:03,710
You are the hope of the helpless

16
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Oh Lord,
please listen to our prayer

17
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:26,750
Please heed the pleas of us orphans

18
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:37,670
We are without resources,
we are destitute

19
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,490
The fact is we are in despair

20
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:58,810
Rescue us from the
atrocities of the wealthy

21
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:09,370
Please preserve the
honor of us orphans

22
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:20,070
May our garden remain ever green

23
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:30,940
May our country
remain ever green

24
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,860
Doctor, tomorrow is Eid (festival).

25
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,300
Has the tailor delivered
the clothes for the kids?

26
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes sir, the clothes have come.

27
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,900
Sir, you are so concerned
for the orphans.

28
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,910
If only every person had
the same sentiments in his heart...

29
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,190
our orphans would
have no woes left.

30
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,260
That's right, kids are all equal...

31
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,100
be they rich or poor.

32
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,090
Besides, these are kids...

33
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,010
whom we are duty bound
to look after on behalf of God!

34
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,780
May god bless you! Thank
God for your presence.

35
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,720
Else we all of us have
forgotten our duties!

36
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:23,110
But Doctor, I notice even
you tend to their health all day.

37
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,990
This is commendable too!

38
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,830
You are being very charitable.

39
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,350
God knows I love all the
kids as much as my son Yusuf!

40
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,840
Where were you, Bedil?

41
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,590
Sir, I was in the operating room.

42
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,390
Just for once speak the truth. Yusuf?

43
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,080
- Yes?
- Was he there?

44
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,950
Actually, Doctor...

45
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,010
I left the operating
room a little early.

46
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,820
Because my heart is very weak,
I can't watch the operation.

47
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,080
Idiot.

48
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,486
Bedil, you have no heart.

49
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,670
How can your heart be weak
when you don't have a heart?

50
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,990
Oh yeah.

51
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,180
Didn't you notice the three
eye candies surrounding me?

52
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,520
You see, my boy?
A heart operation is so risky.

53
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,280
But Mr. Bedil, do you even know...

54
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,380
how that man's frail heart
withstood such major surgery!

55
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,400
How?

56
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,140
Actually his heart was strong
thanks to lots of heartbreak!

57
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,006
Be that as it may, I consider
the world of love an asylum...

58
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,950
and every lover a lunatic!

59
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,856
- Well, to each his own...
- Hello, Bedil.

60
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,630
- Hello! Oh, hello.
- Hey!

61
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,250
Wow. It seems like
candies have been frozen...

62
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,480
and floated into the hospital.

63
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,590
Oh! So you are
a follower of this love!

64
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,410
My dear boy,
you don't need for them.

65
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,430
They would lay their lives for you.

66
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,280
All you need is a box
of chocolates for them.

67
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,800
Anyway, that is my world.

68
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,230
Tell me. How is your love
story progressing these days?

69
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,930
It's okay.
I see her once or twice a year.

70
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,670
These days...

71
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,866
Oh yes, you see her
during one crescent moon.

72
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,290
And then at the next crescent moon.

73
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,016
Have you ever dated her?

74
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,340
We haven't dated.

75
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,970
I've been flirting
with her for years now.

76
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,950
Tell me. Does the man
only have a daughter? No sons?

77
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,456
No, only one daughter.

78
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,360
And how is Mukarram
related to the Nawab?

79
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,690
He isn't kin. He is his
wife's oldest nephew.

80
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,860
Has he given up studies completely?

81
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,380
He isn't interested in studies.

82
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,870
Day and night he gambles,
hunts, plays chess, and flies kites.

83
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,626
He only wakes up
at 10:00 in the morning.

84
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,050
- Ten o'clock?
- Exactly.

85
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,210
And only when a pretty maid
plays sweet notes on the harp.

86
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,910
Oh, wow! That is the
joy of life, my boy.

87
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,630
Bless me for I have
turned you into a killer.

88
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,110
- Shut up!
- Shut Up?

89
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,030
Water.

90
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,720
Soap.

91
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,870
The Nawab Sahib
hasn't arrived yet?

92
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,270
My quail is itching for a fight.

93
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,450
Yes. He'll arrive shortly.

94
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,490
Even my quail is
in the same condition.

95
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,080
Take a look.

96
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,300
He is getting as wild as a lion!

97
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,930
We'll know soon.

98
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,880
Sure.

99
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,910
Greetings.

100
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,650
Greetings!

101
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,180
So you made it?

102
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,050
- That's right.
- Have a seat.

103
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,490
Please begin.

104
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,220
Mir Banne, how is the quail doing?

105
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,790
Take a look, sir!

106
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,800
Great.

107
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,990
He is quite tall.

108
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,170
He really appears to be fierce.

109
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,000
Sir, he is as sharp as a sword.

110
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,380
Never mind a sword,
he's more like a cannon.

111
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,010
No doubt at all, sir!

112
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,320
He won't be defeated easily.
He's as strong as steel, sir.

113
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,190
Mir Banne?

114
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,740
Yes sir.

115
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,940
Get ready for the battle.

116
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:05,280
Wow! Buck up!
Come on! Great! Wow! There goes!

117
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,210
Well done my lion!

118
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,180
You have proved your loyalty today.

119
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,880
I have never enjoyed
a lion-fight as much as this.

120
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,410
I swear I have no regrets
about his running away.

121
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,670
He made Nawab Nabban's
quail bite the dust.

122
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,260
Nawab Nabban was training
his quail for the last seven years.

123
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,590
But he fought with so much gusto.

124
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,680
Looking at his last move...

125
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,530
I thought it chased
Nawab Nabban's bird.

126
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,710
The kick wasn't strong enough...

127
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,760
or it would have worked.

128
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,250
Defeat or victory depends on luck.

129
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,470
But the real challenge
is the spirit of the heart!

130
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,260
I told you earlier
this quail had gone old.

131
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,050
Train another bird.
Did you see that?

132
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,370
Yes Sir.
He ran away because he was old.

133
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,080
Now you say it is old.
You were all praise for it earlier.

134
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,490
When I praise, you praise.

135
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,720
When I criticize, you criticize.

136
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:07,340
Yes Sir, I am not the quail's
slave. I do your bidding, sir.

137
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,470
I know you only too well.

138
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,800
Yet I am prepared to sustain you.

139
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,370
These dark clouds
won't stop chasing us.

140
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,330
One keeps rolling in after another.

141
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,700
But how will the moon be visible?

142
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,280
- Why?
- When the full moon is visible on earth...

143
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,500
how will the
crescent moon show up?

144
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,530
Stop it. I don't like such talk.

145
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,350
Felicitations, ma'am.
There's the moon.

146
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,100
- Where?
- Out there, ma'am!

147
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,180
Felicitations! Felicitations!

148
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,080
Hey, where is it?

149
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,620
Sorry ma'am, I was praying.

150
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:10,380
My eyes have been yearning
for a very long time

151
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:23,570
Please inhabit the
world of my vision

152
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:42,660
Having made you the
possessor of such beauty...

153
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,500
who told God to
make you so cruel?

154
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,470
Please inhabit the
world of my vision

155
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:15,060
I would sacrifice myself
on this bashfulness

156
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,820
Come forward and please my heart

157
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,450
Please inhabit the
world of my vision

158
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:46,440
My heart is in your custody

159
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,990
It is up to you.
Inhabit it or destroy it

160
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,020
Please inhabit the
world of my vision

161
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,480
When he comes to our
house tomorrow for sweets...

162
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,380
I will surely complain to father.

163
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,010
- Oh, please don't tell the Master, ma'am.
- Why not?

164
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,320
It would mean we are weak.
We cannot wreak vengeance.

165
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,770
So what should we do?

166
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,460
Listen.

167
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,500
Eid. Let's hug and celebrate Eid

168
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,970
Eid. Come let's celebrate Eid,
friends

169
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,810
Daily it is milk
and other sweets

170
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,750
Today it is only sweet vermicelli,
friends

171
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,920
Eid. Let's celebrate Eid

172
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,850
Eid. Come let's celebrate Eid,

173
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,560
Big or small,
everybody celebrates Eid

174
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,080
Everybody sings songs of joy

175
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,060
Sweethearts celebrate at Eid,
friends

176
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,030

178
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,670
The old and the young
wish each other happily

179
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,540
Friends wish their bosom friends!

180
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,530
Eid. Come let's celebrate Eid,
friends

181
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,470
Eid. Let's celebrate Eid

182
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,340
Superb! The sweets
were so delicious.

183
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,860
Everyone was licking
their lips in glee.

184
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,630
Here's your gift, Tilak.

185
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,070
Shabnam, here's your gift!

186
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,370
And this is Nawab Najma's gift!

187
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,310
Thank you, father!

188
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,490
The doctor and his
son Yusuf have arrived.

189
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,870
Please ask them to sit.
I'm coming!

190
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,350
Is this the time to visit?

191
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,940
It's been twenty years
since he's settled in Lucknow.

192
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,310
Still, he knows nothing
of Lucknow's etiquette.

193
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,810
That's right.
But why should I forget my manners?

194
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,270
Father, I was unable
to tend to the guests.

195
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,530
If you permit me,
may I serve sweets for these two?

196
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,740
Sure, my child!
Did you see that, sweetheart?

197
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,590
Even the children of sociable
families become sociable.

198
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,486
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

199
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,780
- Greetings!
- God Bless you!

200
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,770
- Happy Eid!
- Happy Eid!

201
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,290
- Happy Eid!
- Happy Eid!

202
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,520
Please take a seat!

203
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,436
Have you put the
chilies in his water?

204
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,020
- Yes.
- I hope you didn't put chilies in the Doctor's water.

205
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,700
- No.
- Get the salt.

206
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,080
Here.

207
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,660
Add lots of salt.

208
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,670
That will teach him
a lesson for flying kites.

209
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,990
Taste that. Should I add some more?

210
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,160
It's like poison, ma'am. Poison!

211
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,030
Be careful not to put
salt in the Doctor's bowl.

212
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,940
No, I'm adding sugar to his bowl.
He's not to blame.

213
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,860
Go bring Gulabo.

214
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,000
Look, this bowl is for the Doctor.

215
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,880
And this one is for his son Yusuf.

216
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,710
- But why so, Ma'am?
- You don't know?

217
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,910
The Doctor consumes more sugar...

218
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,020
while his son consumes less.

219
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,690
- Don't forget.
- No Madam, I get it.

220
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,720
This bowl is for the Doctor
and this one is for his son.

221
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,060
Correct.

222
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,640
Go.

223
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,630
Nawazish Ali! Nawazish Ali!

224
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,500
What?

225
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,620
Look Nawazish Ali,
this bowl is for the Doctor...

226
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,550
and this one is for his son.

227
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,780
But why two different
types of bowls?

228
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,610
I'm fed up with your whims.

229
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,490
Mind your own business.

230
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,350
Shut your mouth
or you'll regret it.

231
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,520
Look here,
you always try to lord over me.

232
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,270
I've been here for last 17 years.

233
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,300
Hundreds like you
have come and gone.

234
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,840
You are always jabbering.

235
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,130
- Do you know who has sent these sweets?
- Who?

236
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,700
The young mistress has
sent it over personally.

237
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,030
And she specifically demanded
what I conveyed to you.

238
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,210
So why didn't you say
anything all this time?

239
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,136
You should have said
so in the first place.

240
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
You just got saved from
being hanged, Nawazish Ali.

241
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,090
And if she does not hang Me,
you do it.

242
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,170
Stop it, you villain!
Take a good look at your face!

243
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,950
I forgot.

244
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,230
Which bowl is for whom?

245
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:18,620
Got it! This is for the doctor.
No, this is for the son.

246
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,560
Forget it. Who cares? Whatever.

247
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,220
Doctor, today's sweets
have become famous...

248
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,010
in almost all of Lucknow.
Come, please have some!

249
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,490
Thanks!

250
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,860
- Please have some.
- Thanks.

251
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:38,290
Quite frankly, I haven't
eaten better sweets than these.

252
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,820
Wonderful!

253
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,160
- Go ahead and have it!
- Yes.

254
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,760
There, he ate it!

255
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,460
Oh, his expression didn't change?

256
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,530
Look, the father is paying
for the son's misdeeds.

257
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,020
Poor Doctor.

258
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,900
He must be thinking
we add salt in our desserts.

259
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,880
Perhaps we will get
the son with the betel leaf.

260
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,120
I hope the betel leaf
gets caught in his throat.

261
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,716
This is superb, sir.

262
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,460
I have never eaten
better vermicelli before.

263
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,850
Have some more, son.
Do not hesitate.

264
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,890
Tell me, Doctor, what is
your opinion of the vermicelli?

265
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,820
It is very good.

266
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,960
It seems as if I
am sitting in heaven...

267
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,800
eating a divine dish.

268
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:40,510
Doctor, it seems you
don't eat too much dessert.

269
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,530
No, sir.

270
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,170
When you were having
the vermicelli...

271
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,780
I could tell from
your expressions.

272
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,850
Yes sir.

273
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,340
Thanks!

274
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,240
Yusuf dear, which year
of medicine are you doing?

275
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,030
The fourth year, sir.

276
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,910
What is the matter, Yusuf dear?
Is everything okay?

277
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,800
The fourth year.

278
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:42,910
The one who offers
me chilies in betel leaves...

279
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:55,910
I am praying for her quietly

280
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:11,750
At least my love
has left this effect

281
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:24,600
It has had a silent
impact on her as well

282
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:40,530
Oh, dear heart,
lest my love be disgraced

283
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,740
Please be discreet about love

284
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,020
Some day she will surely be mine

285
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:22,590
My heart says so.
My heart says so quietly

286
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,650
Give it to me.
This is my Eid gift from aunt.

287
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,260
You came to collect your Eid gift...

288
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,900
but did you think of going
to aunt's house to wish her?

289
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,360
When she was alive
you always went there.

290
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,860
Nobody hides behind
a veil in dad's presence...

291
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,646
but everyone hides
behind veils in my presence.

292
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,816
Who other than Najma hides
behind a veil in your presence?

293
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,230
Sure. Till yesterday
she used to play with me...

294
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,676
but today she has
to hide behind a veil?

295
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,626
Why shouldn't she?
After all, she is a growing girl.

296
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,830
In fact, you should avoid
going in front of her.

297
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,260
That's why I don't go there.

298
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,590
Don't go. You want me
to scold you some more on Eid?

299
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,530
Here. Take your gift.

300
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,480
Greetings!

301
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,100
God bless you!

302
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,410
Why have you come now?

303
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,630
Mom, may God grant you a long life!

304
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,360
Please, may I have another
five hundred rupees?

305
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,560
What for? Just the day before
yesterday you took five hundred.

306
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,976
And now this?

307
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,400
This is my Eid gift.

308
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,140
And the other five hundred?

309
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,276
A hundred went towards
the kite fliers' wages...

310
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,796
a hundred towards the
quail trainers' wages...

311
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,406
a one hundred-fifty towards
the chess players' wages...

312
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,706
and a hundred-fifty
for other entertainers.

313
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,116
Five hundred rupees are gone.

314
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,540
And what is this money for?

315
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:47,560
Look Mom, winter has set in.
I need to buy new pigeons.

316
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,030
I have to get their clothes sown.

317
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,350
And above all, eight kite
games remain to be played.

318
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,560
Mukarram,
when will you mend your ways?

319
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,160
You gave up studying ages ago.

320
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,490
If your marriage
is proposed shortly...

321
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,750
their first query will be,
What does the boy do?

322
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:11,090
Mom, what are you saying?
I did O level in English.

323
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:15,940
I know Arabic and Persian too.
What more do you want, mom?

324
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,350
But my boy, you must put
this knowledge to good use.

325
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,200
Oh! You mean to say
I should take up a job.

326
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:27,320
Has anyone in the family
taken a job before now?

327
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,400
Give me one example of
anyone having taking up a job.

328
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,080
Those were different times.

329
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,090
Becoming a judge or barrister
brings you renown these days.

330
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,940
Mom, the fact is
that if you have money...

331
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,330
you can buy off ten
judges and ten barristers.

332
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,870
Look at how famous your son is.

333
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,230
I am an excellent kite-flyer,
excellent quail-fighter...

334
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,820
nobody can beat
me in the board games.

335
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,310
And don't even mention chess.

336
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,390
I receive hundreds
of invitations from abroad.

337
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,570
But what can I say?
I cannot leave Lucknow.

338
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,300
As for people like Sultan Khan...

339
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,940
they are hopeless.

340
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,430
- Really, my son?
- Would I lie to you?

341
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,940
These wrists are so strong,
all of Lucknow swears by them.

342
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,400
Is that so?

343
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:23,010
Is that so? Recently
your son broke an iron rod.

344
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,556
Oh God! I hope you
didn't hurt yourself, son.

345
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,530
Not at all, mom.
These wrists are made of lead.

346
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,890
Tell me, is your son inferior
to any judge or barrister?

347
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,530
Not at all, Mukarram!
You are right.

348
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,350
Then let me have those
five hundred rupees.

349
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,190
Give it to me. Go on. Go on.

350
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,080
- Go on.
- Okay.

351
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,790
The heart.

352
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,930
It is the most vital
organ of the body...

353
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,030
and is related to
all other parts of the body.

354
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,220
The heartbeat gives
life to the entire body...

355
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:59,620
and if it stops
life comes to an end.

356
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,490
Bedil, matters of the heart
are being discussed. Love, too.

357
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:09,540
My dear friend,
you discuss love daily.

358
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,440
Has there been any
mention of love as yet?

359
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,150
Let us clarify this today.

360
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,810
Watch out, my boy,
lest you be embarrassed.

361
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,860
Excuse me Doctor,
I want to ask you...

362
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,500
where in the heart
does one find love?

363
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,610
The world of the heart is so big.

364
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,680
Love must be lying
in some nook and cranny.

365
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:37,806
That means you admit
that love actually exists...

366
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,480
and that it is
found around there?

367
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,560
It is perfectly clear now.
Sit down.

368
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,800
Shut up!

369
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,900
So you admit love exists?

370
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:52,680
But what is this about?
Why the preoccupation with love?

371
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,890
I'm not preoccupied
with love, he is.

372
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,330
And I am not an
enthusiast of love.

373
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,760
Not an enthusiast, or incapable?

374
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,560
Excuse me.

375
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,800
If you aren't an enthusiast
of love, you aren't human.

376
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,170
In fact it is for
the sake of love...

377
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,200
that this whole wide
world of has been created.

378
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,420
Why did you have to tease me?

379
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,480
You are very mischievous.

380
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,820
But I got back.

381
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,030
You got stung by the chilies.

382
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:45,360
What if had told my dad?

383
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,320
But how could I have done that?

384
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,010
Did I have the heart to do so?

385
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,530
You could have borrowed it from me,
my dear...

386
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,580
and told the Nawab.

387
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,670
Tilak, I was trying
to compose a couplet.

388
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,640
Sure. To get the correct emotions...

389
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,830
you placed Mr. Yusuf's
torn kite was in front of you.

390
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,530
Nonsense! Where is the paper?

391
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,710
Your wish is my command!
Shall I tell you something?

392
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,110
What?

393
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,780
Love seeks a confidante.

394
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,680
Tell him tomorrow if not today.
What's the big deal?

395
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,020
Shut up! It appears as
if you are looking for trouble.

396
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:27,860
Sure. A truthful person
is always looking for trouble.

397
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,470
Wait.

398
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,080
Why?

399
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,100
Why?

400
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,100
Why?

401
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,160
Why would you say such a thing?

402
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,640
The secret in your
heart will come out

403
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,700
With that heartthrob thief

404
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,740
Which thief?

405
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:30,509
Why?

406
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,679
Why would you say such a thing?

407
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:45,230
This is no way to behave

408
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,890
I don't understand you

409
00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:01,630
If you make the wrong move,
you are sure to lose

410
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,430
Why?

411
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,480
Why would you say such a thing?

412
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:28,430
Love is playing sun
and shade at this time

413
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,360
You will spend your nights
counting stars in future

414
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:48,860
Throughout the night.
Throughout the night

415
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,200
Why?

416
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,400
Why would you say such a thing?

417
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,740
My dear, I'm fed up
with your love story!

418
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,210
Ages have passed
without any result.

419
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,280
I did not fall in love for results.

420
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,720
Why else?

421
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,786
Stop talking nonsense!

422
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,400
Either you take my advice...

423
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,890
or stop telling me the
story of your hopeless love.

424
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,646
Buddy, tell me a simple way.

425
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,830
Your suggestions are the
kind that could get me bashed.

426
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,750
Really? So you're afraid
of being bashed up now?

427
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,480
Then you should forget love.
Go to Banaras.

428
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,190
My dear man,
I swear if I were in your place...

429
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,176
by now I would have
spoken to her many times...

430
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,730
and met her thousands of times.

431
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,130
Will you suggest something
or go on lecturing me like this?

432
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,380
My dear, take me for instance.

433
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,320
Listen, when I fell
in love with my wife...

434
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,500
Listen...

435
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,050
that is your sister-in-law,
around six years back.

436
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,740
Not so I could flirt with
her while another married her.

437
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,650
- Really?
- But because I could take her as my wife.

438
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,770
My dear I swear by you,
I was bashed up hundreds of times.

439
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,870
- I was laid up in bed. You know what I did then?
- What?

440
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,350
As soon as I got up from
bed I was back to my old ways!

441
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,360
You're really brave!
So what was the outcome?

442
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,716
You're asking about the
outcome again? Don't you see...

443
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,730
I have six kids like
you playing in the house?

444
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,230
Your kids!
When did you get married?

445
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,300
Take it for granted.
Such things are taken for granted.

446
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,220
Well, trainer Bedil,
let me try my luck today.

447
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,450
Sure. You must go!
Take the plunge, my dear.

448
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,430
Success is desperate
to kiss your feet.

449
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,710
But if something
untoward does happen...

450
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,940
Untoward? What do you mean?

451
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,120
I mean even if you get bashed up.

452
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,090
I shall keep a bed ready.

453
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:44,510
Bless me for I turned
you into a hearty romantic.

454
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,530
Tilak is out! Tilak is out!

455
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,330
Go stand facing the
wall in front of you.

456
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,960
Don't come till someone
calls out to you.

457
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,750
Go.

458
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,780
- May I come?
- Not yet.

459
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,510
May I come?

460
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,600
- Not yet.
- Oh God! Who is this devil?

461
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,560
Not the devil, it is I, Yusuf.

462
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,350
- Oh, Mr. Yusuf.
- Yes.

463
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,510
What are you doing
here at this hour?

464
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,620
I have come for some
very urgent help from you.

465
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,550
- From me?
- Yes.

466
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,846
Only you can do it.

467
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,270
Well, what work?

468
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,400
Well, what work?

469
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,380
Just let me have
a glimpse of Najma.

470
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,030
So the fire is raging
equally on both the sides.

471
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,810
Not today.

472
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,250
Not today? Then when?

473
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,820
Tomorrow.

474
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,270
Oh no. I shall die.

475
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,540
I'd be grateful if you tried today.

476
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,810
Oh God! How do I manage it?

477
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,830
Look, go notify Najma.

478
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,510
After she's notified,
ask her to hide over here.

479
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,630
Did you hatch this
plan when you left home?

480
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,790
No. By your grace I
only thought of it just now.

481
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,310
Tilak, you may come now.

482
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,420
Tilak, you may come now.

483
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,000
Coming.

484
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,580
I am waiting, ma'am.

485
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,130
Please don't forget.

486
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,330
You're under my oath.

487
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,850
Ma'am is tagged!
Ma'am is tagged! Ma'am is tagged!

488
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,750
Okay, tell me, where shall I hide?

489
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,020
Exactly the same place I hid.

490
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,210
Ma'am, do not come
out until I call you.

491
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,170
May I come?

492
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,410
Not yet.

493
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,660
May I come?

494
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,750
- Not yet.
- My goodness!

495
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,180
Who is this ill-mannered fellow?

496
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,530
It is bad manners no doubt.

497
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,610
But I'm afraid you
didn't recognize me.

498
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,800
How would I know?

499
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,500
Great!

500
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,370
Miss, I am the person
who was robbed at your place.

501
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,730
- Who robbed you?
- You did, Miss.

502
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,000
- Me?
- Yes, miss!

503
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,910
What did I rob?

504
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,210
Well, you stole my kites...

505
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,670
fed me chilies in the
betel leaf, and stole my heart.

506
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:28,060
Today it appears as if...

507
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:40,180
the world seems to be changing

508
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,780
Today it appears as if...

509
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:02,550
the world is taking
on a new zeal

510
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,600
The color of happiness
is spreading across the world

511
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:26,410
The world is taking
on a new zeal

512
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:39,140
Whose voice did my ears hear?

513
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,680
This heart is
uncontrollable in the bosom

514
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:10,360
The more she tries
to hide from me...

515
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:22,580
the more my eyes yearn for her

516
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:39,150
The stars are twinkling

517
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:51,580
Someone is smiling somewhere

518
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:08,400
To whom is the moon so attracted?

519
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:20,990
The moon is alighting
on the Earth

520
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,160
Even your voice is
laced with pain now.

521
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,570
What?

522
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:40,370
Do you ever get any sleep?

523
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,580
Go to bed.

524
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:45,130
And are you resting too?

525
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,100
I was about to sleep.

526
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,910
But I was disturbed
by your arrival.

527
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:51,940
You think you will
get sleep if I go away?

528
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,820
Why?

529
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:56,780
Because you will not sleep.

530
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,086
You're being crazy again.

531
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,510
No, not crazy.

532
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:04,630
Listen, I nodded
off for a little while...

533
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:10,500
and dreamt of you standing
near the wall like a thief.

534
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,720
Suddenly I heard someone's
voice from outside.

535
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,956
Whose voice?

536
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,550
Well, I forget.
Actually I was sleepy...

537
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,970
but it sure as hell
sounded like Mr. Yusuf's voice.

538
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,000
So both of you were
in on the conspiracy?

539
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:28,710
Listen.

540
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,450
I don't want to hear it. Go away.

541
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,040
It is to your advantage.
Listen or you'll be sorry.

542
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,420
Uh-huh.

543
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:36,850
'Uh-huh' means 'yes'.

544
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,440
I didn't hear it.

545
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:41,010
When you say 'hear it' after the 'not',
it means you heard me.

546
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,350
Continue speaking nonsense!

547
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,830
Turning away means 'as you wish'.

548
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:47,830
Okay. Good night!

549
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,560
Please go to sleep soon.

550
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,440
God damn, the love patient.

551
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,340
Dad is around.

552
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,660
I meant to say, God bless you.

553
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,190
And it is time for your medicine.

554
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,380
Tel me, what was the outcome?

555
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,260
Did you meet? Spoke to her?

556
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:20,750
No. Nothing much.

557
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,480
You aren't opening up today.

558
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,340
Something is fishy.

559
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:30,000
Would I lie to you?
I told you nothing much happened.

560
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:32,440
You are hiding things
from a person like me?

561
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,320
Look at me.

562
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,190
My boy,
your eyes are dripping love.

563
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,220
My foot, my tutor!

564
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,290
That means my eyes
didn't drip love before.

565
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:48,130
It did, but it was awful.

566
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:51,280
You have become stronger
thanks to me, else...

567
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:58,820
there is no control on love.
This is a fire.

568
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,930
Hey! My dad is unwell.

569
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,740
So what?
I am merely singing, not crying.

570
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:08,480
And music is beneficial
for all ailments.

571
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,260
You want me to be beaten up?
He is not well.

572
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:14,820
Bless me for I have turned
you into a hearty romantic.

573
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,660
Hey! What are you doing?

574
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,530
Stop it, will you?

575
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,950
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

576
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:22,330
Yes, tell me.

577
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,960
Who is this?

578
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,800
He is the Nawab's employee.

579
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,560
I see! So this is the Nawab's...

580
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,316
What's the matter?

581
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,736
The young mistress is unwell.

582
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,160
The Nawab has sent for the Doctor.

583
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:35,350
You go ahead.
I shall send him right away.

584
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,080
There you go, my dear.

585
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:43,096
Just one meeting and
she's got love fever.

586
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,376
Quiet.

587
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,220
Bless me for I have turned
you into a hearty romantic.

588
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,460
Yusuf!

589
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,120
Your dad's here.

590
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,710
Hey, what's all the noise about?

591
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:57,760
Greetings, Doctor.

592
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:00,340
Bedil is here. God bless you, son.

593
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,520
Father, Nawazish from
the Nawab's house was here.

594
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,790
The young lady is unwell.
They wish to see you.

595
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,410
- Have they called me now?
- Yes.

596
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,850
Okay.

597
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,520
Hush!

598
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:18,550
Yusuf, please get my bag ready.

599
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:20,580
I shall change and
be back right away.

600
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,180
Very well.

601
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:23,916
Hey, let go.

602
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,850
This is a good chance.
Hide his bag somewhere.

603
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,446
What good will it do?

604
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,160
Tell your dad to
proceed in a hurry...

605
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:31,300
while you follow
him with the bag.

606
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:34,170
That's fantastic, my boy!

607
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,670
You see?
This is called expert advice.

608
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,320
- Bless me for I have turned you into a hearty romantic.
- Hush!

609
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:46,090
- Yusuf!
- Yes?

610
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:58,200
Yusuf, my boy, bring me my bag.

611
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,640
I am looking for
it but I can't find it.

612
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,330
What? Where has it gone?

613
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:05,300
Well, it must be around.
Father, you are in a hurry.

614
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:07,116
You proceed and I will
follow you with the bag.

615
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,340
Okay.

616
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,520
But please bring it quickly.

617
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,510
Yes. Yes. I shall come right away.

618
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,040
Mr. Yusuf has come.

619
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:22,370
Escort him in.

620
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,320
You shouldn't have taken
the trouble since you are unwell.

621
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,580
Not at all. I'm feeling better now.

622
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,920
Even Yusuf can attend
to such minor treatments.

623
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,910
Yes. By the grace of God...

624
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:35,550
Yusuf even attends
to major ailments now.

625
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,450
- Greeting, sir!
- God bless you!

626
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,960
Where was the bag?

627
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,740
It was right there.
But neither one of us saw it.

628
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:46,910
I heard you tend to major
ailments now by God's grace.

629
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,440
Yes, sir!

630
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,516
Something interesting happened
yesterday at the Medical College.

631
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,940
What happened, Yusuf?

632
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:53,670
Well, a patient came in with fever.

633
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:57,360
None of the doctors
could diagnose his fever.

634
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:58,710
And?

635
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:02,730
I took his pulse and
by your grace I told them...

636
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,630
the cause of the fever
was terror and fright!

637
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,250
Great! That is really excellent!

638
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,100
God bless you!

639
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,630
Well, please take
a look at my daughter.

640
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,870
She might not be suffering
with the same kind of fever.

641
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,870
Yes, this fever is
common these days. Dad?

642
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:17,910
Sure, son. Please go ahead.

643
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,090
I would like to take her pulse.

644
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,520
Certainly. Come along!

645
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,600
Yusuf wants to take her pulse!

646
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:30,190
Very well.

647
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,730
Come.

648
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:51,590
Is everything alright, Yusuf?

649
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,520
Well, I did mention to you earlier.

650
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:55,690
It is the same.
Terror-fever.

651
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:57,130
You saw how it affected me?

652
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,456
I immediately got a shock.

653
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,670
Yusuf, is the pulse-rate very fast?

654
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,046
Yes, father.

655
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:03,500
But there's no reason to worry.

656
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,330
This is symptomatic of this fever.

657
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,310
I need to make some
queries now, sir.

658
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,190
Yes, of course.

659
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:16,030
Tell me, ma'am, did you go
near a shrub in the past few days?

660
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,880
I mean in a garden?

661
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,320
Yes!

662
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:27,670
Now ask her if she
saw a shadow near the wall.

663
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,240
She says she thought
that shadow was a human being.

664
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:35,470
But it turned out to be a monkey.

665
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,770
Oh, okay!
What did you say? Monkey?

666
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,620
How did those cheeky monkeys
get into the garden?

667
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,920
She says she's afraid.

668
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,450
Don't worry, young lady.
The monkey can't do you any harm.

669
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:08,410
Monkeys are known for this.
The rest is up to the monkey.

670
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,990
No problem, ma'am.
Please do not worry.

671
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,070
I shall get my dad to
write out a prescription.

672
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,320
Well done, Yusuf.

673
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:19,850
You seem to know a lot
more than mere medicine.

674
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:23,020
Yes. This is the marvel
of science these days.

675
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,696
Tell me Nawazish Ali,
what news have you brought?

676
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,570
Sir, the doctor is still unwell.

677
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,660
Hasn't his pain subsided
since last night?

678
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,490
Yes sir. That's kidney pain.

679
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,120
I shall accompany you
to see the doctor right away.

680
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,060
Why did you take the trouble?

681
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,580
What are you saying?

682
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:57,020
A neighbor's duty comes
before a relative's, doctor.

683
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:00,930
You're right.
Thanks to you that is true.

684
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:04,880
Else these are times when
the son tells his father...

685
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:08,440
he flatly refuses to marry.

686
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,740
What is the matter, doctor?

687
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,250
What can I say, Nawab?

688
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:16,050
It appears as though
this pain will subside...

689
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,510
only after killing me.

690
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,320
God forbid, doctor!

691
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,340
I mean it.

692
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:25,980
I wanted Yusuf to marry
while I'm still alive.

693
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,620
But the sons these days
do not pay heed to anything...

694
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,090
and flatly refuse
you to your face.

695
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:36,120
Has Yusuf turned down marriage?

696
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,480
Yes.

697
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,230
My niece Razia and
his alliance was fixed...

698
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:46,290
ten years ago with my permission.

699
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,280
Little did I know...

700
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:52,970
Yusuf would disgrace
me thus in my final days.

701
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,570
Don't lose heart.
I shall talk to him.

702
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,150
In fact, I have the right
to scold him if need be.

703
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:00,250
But what does he say?

704
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:02,870
Find out for yourself.

705
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:05,800
Because I feel it would be best...

706
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:09,490
for him to get engaged
within a day or two.

707
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,160
Yusuf, please come here.

708
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:14,550
Coming.

709
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:16,666
Greetings, sir!

710
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:17,790
God bless you!

711
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:20,880
Yusuf, you passed
your medical exam...

712
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,770
and yet you did
not treat me to sweets?

713
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:24,250
Yes.

714
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,430
How long will you continue
working at the hospital?

715
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,240
- Another two months.
- And afterwards?

716
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,890
I shall set up my own
clinic and start practicing.

717
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:35,510
Yusuf, I fail to understand...

718
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:40,270
how an obedient son
like you could refuse.

719
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:45,040
Especially when your
father is in this condition.

720
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:48,180
Why are you objecting
to marry Razia?

721
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:52,810
She's family. Well-known,
accomplished, and pretty.

722
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:56,350
And most interesting is
that she is of the same blood.

723
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,740
That's right.

724
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,960
Another thing.
This is the seventh generation...

725
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:04,820
where the girls and boys
have married within the family.

726
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:07,730
Yes. My family is the same.

727
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,060
We would rather lose our lives...

728
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,026
before the girls and
boys marry outside the family.

729
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:13,450
That is the pride of the family.

730
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:17,180
But, sir, may I say something?

731
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:21,290
How can an uneducated wife
please her educated husband?

732
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,540
What nonsense!
When we got married...

733
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,960
the wives weren't very literate.

734
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,940
Just the basic home education,
and good upbringing...

735
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:32,590
which I regard far better.

736
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,740
But, sir, your family
is a whole other matter.

737
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,810
The education and upbringing
is far better in your family.

738
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,420
You see?

739
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,016
God, please grant me quick death...

740
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,390
so I don't have
to hear any more of this.

741
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:49,586
- Doctor...
- Yusuf, you dare to insult my family to my face!

742
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:52,300
- That's not what...
- When your own kin says such things...

743
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,360
- to whom will we marry our daughters?
- But, father...

744
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:58,280
I have given my word
for this match ten years ago.

745
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,160
This promise cannot be broken.

746
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,590
- Either you marry her or I will commit suicide.
- Doctor!

747
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:06,900
If I had a son like
this I would shoot him dead.

748
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:11,220
The father's condition is so
bad and he refuses to marry? Fool!

749
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,470
I feel he is in love with a girl.

750
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,180
That is the reason for his refusal.

751
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:20,180
Be that as it may! Yusuf's
refusal to marry at this time...

752
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,480
is practically the
same as to going against God.

753
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,860
Yes, that is true.

754
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,230
Do parents rear and educate
their children for this?

755
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,450
So that the father makes
his will at his deathbed...

756
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,120
while the son refuses marriage.

757
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:35,540
Such children are
better off dead at birth.

758
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,030
You are right. The world
just does not care these days.

759
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:41,280
Well, I am going out for a while.

760
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,800
Where to?

761
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,270
I'll go visit the doctor.

762
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,701
Then I shall try to persuade him.
Perhaps he will concede.

763
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:03,430
Tilak...

764
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,450
tell him I have heard everything.

765
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:10,790
It would be best for
him to pay heed to the elders.

766
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:13,830
That is no longer possible.

767
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:16,390
I am helpless.

768
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,080
Try to forget me.

769
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,800
I tried.
But I could not forget you.

770
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:24,850
I could be disgraced
if you take another step.

771
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,660
I have come too far.
I cannot revert now.

772
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:32,210
Family honor is the greatest
thing in my opinion.

773
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,100
And love?

774
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,880
Is that of no importance
in your opinion?

775
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:38,410
I told you I am helpless.

776
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:45,450
If you insist you
will lose me forever.

777
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,350
What did you say?
Lose you forever?

778
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,230
Yes.

779
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,200
What do you have to say now?

780
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,350
Nothing.

781
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,540
Your wish is my command now.

782
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,460
Because my life depends
on your well-being.

783
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:04,950
This is not a command.

784
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,360
I am requesting you.

785
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:09,770
One last request.

786
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,890
If the whole world insisted
I would not have agreed.

787
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,950
But I am obligated to you.

788
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:23,250
You need not worry.

789
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,590
I shall agonize my entire life...

790
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:29,590
but I will not
bring disgrace on you.

791
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:41,850
Mr. Yusuf,
do you agree to marry Razia...

792
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:48,770
daughter of Ahmed Hussain
for a dowry of one thousand coins?

793
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:51,080
I accept.

794
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:13,180
Continue singing,
for it is spring. Sing

795
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,950
The sorrow of love makes me cry

796
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,370
There's happiness all around

797
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:53,340
It is spring all around

798
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:04,290
There's grief all around

799
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:11,390
Life is full of pain

800
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:21,960
My smile is like the moonlight,
my joy is like spring

801
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:37,750
In my opinion, without you
flowers are like thorns to me

802
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:48,960
There is no sorrow today

803
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,800
My heart is at peace

804
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,860
You have inflicted
this sorrow on me

805
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:11,700
That is why I love this sorrow

806
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:20,470
Sing. Sing.
I sacrifice myself for you

807
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:29,450
Continue singing,
for it is spring. Sing

808
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:41,920
The sorrow of love makes me cry

809
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:05,140
Sister, this time you
have come after a long time.

810
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:08,430
Goodness! My eyes yearned
for a glimpse of your face.

811
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,960
I was longing to come too.

812
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:13,570
But I did not have the time.

813
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:17,700
Now tell me, how is Najma?

814
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,700
She is a little better now, sister.

815
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,010
God bless you, my child.

816
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:29,870
Why did you take the trouble?

817
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,580
To welcome you.

818
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:34,440
Bless you! Do you see
how much she cares for me?

819
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,880
You are right.

820
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:38,870
Go get some rest, my child. Go.

821
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,980
It is always such
a pleasure to see Najma.

822
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,600
She is a lovely girl.
May god bless her!

823
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,520
Have a seat, sister.

824
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,490
Well, have you fixed a date as yet?

825
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:54,960
Yes, sister.

826
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:58,010
Sister, Najma is your own child.

827
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:02,240
Who in the family could
be better than Mukarram?

828
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,870
Just tell us when.

829
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,460
But there is one problem.

830
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:09,390
It has only been a while
since the Doctor passed away.

831
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,840
Yes I heard.

832
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:12,170
I was very sorry.

833
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:15,700
But I'm glad he got his
son married during his lifetime.

834
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:18,380
This marriage took place
with great difficulty, sister.

835
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:21,280
We are glad Yusuf
conceded at my insistence.

836
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:23,210
He has great respect for me.

837
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:26,430
God bless him. He is a good boy.

838
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:28,310
Yes.

839
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:30,450
So how long will you wait?

840
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,380
Just another week.

841
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:35,380
His final obsequies
are on this Sunday.

842
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:40,640
You are aware the late
doctor was my close friend.

843
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:44,070
After that it is up to you.
Anytime you wish.

844
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:48,980
I feel any day soon should be good.

845
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:50,500
As you wish.

846
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,310
- What do you say?
- Certainly, sister.

847
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,520
- Ma'am...
- What?

848
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,140
Ma'am...

849
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:04,030
Why don't you say
what you wish to say?

850
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:06,190
I know what you want to say.

851
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,260
I know why my aunt came.

852
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:10,730
Shall I tell you
what's going to happen?

853
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:03,260
Who is that?
Why is she pushing her way forward?

854
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,160
She is Dr. Yusuf's wife, Razia.

855
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:09,990
Is this Razia?

856
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:11,120
Yes.

857
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:27,630
Tell me,
did you like the pretty bride?

858
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:31,150
Not so great. She's alright.

859
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:33,690
Please don't say
that in my presence.

860
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:37,080
I'm sorry.
I don't know how to mince words.

861
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,310
I only call a spade a spade.

862
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:47,340
Do you agree to
marry Nawab Mukarram...

863
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:50,310
for a dowry of ten lakh rupees?

864
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,090
Say yes, my girl.

865
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,420
Just as your mother and
you grandmother said yes.

866
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:02,440
Say it. Say yes, my girl.

867
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,150
No need to feel shy. Just say yes.

868
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:08,120
Hmm...

869
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:10,300
Congratulations! Congratulations!

870
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:20,720
Burn, burn.
Burn, oh moth. Burn down to ashes

871
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:29,250
Nobody understands your pain

872
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:43,260
Only the victim understands

873
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,750
Burn away silently

874
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:06,310
Burn, burn.
Burn, oh moth. Burn down to ashes

875
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:16,130
Do not narrate your tale of woes,
you silly

876
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:25,180
Do not make the smiling ones cry,
you silly

877
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,020
Burn away with a smile

878
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:58,980
Unite. Go unite with your flower,
oh honeybee

879
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:17,710
Strangers don't
appreciate your pain

880
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:31,010
Only a family member
would understand

881
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:39,620
Go meet up with your own ones

882
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:53,920
Unite. Go unite with your flower,
oh honeybee

883
01:08:57,479 --> 01:09:01,489
Do not wander from bough to bough,
you silly

884
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:10,240
Don't stumble in a falsely
inebriated condition

885
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:19,050
Come to your senses and unite

886
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:33,310
Unite. Go unite with your flower,
oh honeybee

887
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,580
Unite

888
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,410
Your song was good, Razia.
You sing well.

889
01:09:44,069 --> 01:09:49,249
Even you sing well. But
your song had a modicum of pain.

890
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,850
Perhaps your voice is such.

891
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:53,830
And how about your song?

892
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,410
It was a dance of joy.
Tell me something.

893
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:00,410
I know you are the moth.

894
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:05,060
But where is the fire?
And where is she blazing?

895
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,840
Fire? She is present
in my own house.

896
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:10,700
Don't you see the
bright lights all around?

897
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:12,550
Thank you.

898
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:20,280
By the way, I saw Najma.
She isn't very pretty.

899
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,860
Ever since you have
returned from the wedding...

900
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,760
you've done nothing
but criticize the bride.

901
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,376
Don't you have
anything better to do?

902
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,480
Bride? Don't you
mention her by name?

903
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:35,636
What is the big deal
in mentioning her name?

904
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:38,960
Razia. Najma.
I can mention everybody's name.

905
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,320
But you are aware my late
father was the Nawab's employee.

906
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,060
I owe my education and
this house to the Nawab.

907
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:49,900
That's why I don't feel
right criticizing that family.

908
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,940
Sure. Why would you tolerate
criticism of that family?

909
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,640
Just what do you read all day long?

910
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:00,246
How do I explain it
to an illiterate like you?

911
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:03,450
How can I practice if I
don't study? You talk nonsense.

912
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,530
Why marry me when I am illiterate?

913
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,881
Father knew the answer to that.
You should have asked him.

914
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:11,960
Or you can go home and ask uncle.

915
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,700
That means they forced
you into this marriage.

916
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:19,180
You did not wish to do so.

917
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:21,930
Why are we debating this issue now?

918
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,000
I just returned from the clinic.
I haven't even rested after eating.

919
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:28,080
That's why I'm telling you
to sleep. Read it in the morning.

920
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,670
Eighteen. Eighteen. It is eighteen!

921
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,260
The dice are askew.
Look properly.

922
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,326
- No, it is not askew.
- It is askew.

923
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:46,456
- No, it isn't.
- It is askew.

924
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,420
You cheat this way.
I refuse to play with you.

925
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:51,610
Please get some sleep now, ma'am.

926
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:55,930
You go to bed. I will sleep later.

927
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,220
When?

928
01:11:58,490 --> 01:11:59,890
At whatever time he comes in.

929
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:03,330
How long will you
wait for the master?

930
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:05,710
For as long as there is
life left in my eyes.

931
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:10,030
Ma'am, this world
is a strange place.

932
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:17,120
Only some kings and jewelers
recognize pearls and diamonds.

933
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:18,990
What do you mean?

934
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:22,490
If you had married Yusuf...

935
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:24,200
Tilak! What nonsense is this?

936
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:27,071
You are sinning and you
are making a sinner of me as well.

937
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:30,190
Have you no shame mentioning
a strange man this way?

938
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:31,920
- Yusuf is a stranger?
- Yes.

939
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:34,690
He's been a stranger
to me since the nuptials.

940
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:38,200
My Nawab is my faith, my world,
and my duty hereafter.

941
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,996
I'm shocked...

942
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:43,400
you could say such a thing
despite being brought up with me.

943
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,210
Madam! What is the matter with you?

944
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:47,830
You do not understand as yet?
Let me make it clear.

945
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:52,210
A girl buries her desires,
her hopes and love of dear ones...

946
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:55,280
at her maternal home.
She gets married...

947
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,200
and only leaves her
husband's home after death.

948
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,876
You will return
home tomorrow morning.

949
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,380
I do not need you any more.

950
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:02,610
Ma'am...

951
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:05,090
Not Ma'am.
I am someone's wife now.

952
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:07,350
I wish to obey all
of my husband's commands.

953
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:09,730
But my order remains
unchanged in your case.

954
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:12,246
- Get out of here!
- But you require a companion.

955
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:14,280
Tilak, I no longer
need a confidante.

956
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:16,210
This is my greatest confidante.

957
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,350
God's wish is my command hereafter.

958
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:04,280
Is this the only outcome of love?

959
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:29,440
Thousand of woes and
only one innocent heart

960
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:48,210
My world is so very dark

961
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:06,680
Even the morning is
twilight in my opinion

962
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:34,900
I understand this
from my heartbeats...

963
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:53,510
that life is
another name for anxiety

964
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:19,710
I am pleased with my broken heart,
therefore...

965
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:38,390
again today your
name comes to my lips

966
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:59,230
Is this the only outcome of love?

967
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,920
Are you finished singing?

968
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,640
Yes.

969
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,100
I thought you were studying.

970
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:12,390
Yes, I felt like
singing for a change.

971
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:14,520
Sing some more.

972
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:17,160
I'm done singing.
I shall sing again when I wish to.

973
01:17:17,650 --> 01:17:19,050
Why would you want to sing now?

974
01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:21,600
- What do you mean?
- I am here.

975
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:23,706
No, that's not the reason.

976
01:17:23,730 --> 01:17:25,240
If I am in the mood
I'll sing again.

977
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:26,770
Wait for a little while.

978
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:28,980
Mood?

979
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:32,460
Why don't you say
if you miss someone?

980
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:35,570
Miss whom?

981
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:36,960
Could be anyone.

982
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:40,630
God forbid anyone falls in love...

983
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:43,560
and be unsuccessful.

984
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,890
You are bringing
up the same topic again?

985
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:47,840
Are you offended?

986
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:50,910
I bet she is yearning
for you over there.

987
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:53,630
And here you...

988
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,880
- Vile woman!
- What did you say?

989
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:58,690
If you ever malign anyone
I shall break your bones.

990
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:00,920
- You'll break my bones?
- Yes!

991
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:05,240
Yes? Oh My God!
Hit me some more. Hit me some more.

992
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:08,530
It was my misfortune
I got married to you.

993
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,500
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

994
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:12,040
So why is she crying?

995
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,350
How would I know?

996
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:16,620
You find everything I say taunting.

997
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:20,090
I will go home to my mother's home.

998
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:22,580
Go away!

999
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:40,580
All of you, leave.

1000
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,750
Roshan, you stay here.

1001
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:08,930
Water.

1002
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,000
You? Why did you take the trouble?

1003
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,340
Where the hell are all the maids?

1004
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:27,480
I forbade them to do any work.

1005
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:28,930
Why?

1006
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:33,570
So that I may serve you.

1007
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,750
But this is not your job.

1008
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:39,610
Yes, you are right.

1009
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:45,510
But I have no other
means to get near you.

1010
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:49,620
Excuse me. I got so tied
up playing dice last night...

1011
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:51,070
Please take a seat.

1012
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:53,370
Was the game too complicated?

1013
01:19:53,570 --> 01:19:56,810
Yes. Nawab Nabban
had only one coin left...

1014
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,940
and both my warriors
were still alive.

1015
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:00,520
What happened next?

1016
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:02,600
I cornered the coin for hours.

1017
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:04,250
So did you win or lose?

1018
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:08,530
By your grace, nobody can
compete with me at this time.

1019
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:11,370
Possibly your warrior
was left behind.

1020
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,440
Yes. It seemed so.

1021
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:15,850
What?

1022
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,780
Do you know how to
play the board game?

1023
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:20,960
Just a wee bit.
Would you like to play?

1024
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:23,050
Sure. A good deed
needs no permission.

1025
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:33,740
Is this bet acceptable? Or
do you want to play another match?

1026
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,700
You think I lost this match?

1027
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,040
Hold on, I'll be back shortly.

1028
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:46,870
- Agha Hazar.
- Yes sir.

1029
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:48,230
Come here.

1030
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:51,130
Not you, only Agha Hazar.

1031
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:57,590
Yes Master.

1032
01:20:57,930 --> 01:21:01,970
I'm playing backgammon
with my wife. And I am losing.

1033
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,200
What's her position on the board?

1034
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:08,640
The wife has lost both warriors.
Only one coin remains.

1035
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:11,520
- What about you?
- I have both my warriors intact.

1036
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:13,940
- So play another board.
- What?

1037
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:15,530
Play another board?

1038
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:18,460
Play another board? And
you consider yourself an expert?

1039
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:20,580
Get out of here! Go!

1040
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,040
Forgive me. It took me a while.

1041
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,000
Nawab Zaki is a great
player of backgammon.

1042
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:38,810
He came to consult
me for a good move.

1043
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,910
I see. So you accept this bet?

1044
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:47,030
Do you know how to play chess?

1045
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:49,410
Just a wee bit.
Would you like to play?

1046
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:50,660
Yes, come on.

1047
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:58,360
There. Check.

1048
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,950
It is too early for that.
Here goes.

1049
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:04,050
And that is mate!

1050
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,490
Don't disturb this board.
I'll return right away.

1051
01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:14,190
Abban!

1052
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:15,556
Yes sir.

1053
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:16,680
Come here.

1054
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:18,720
Not you. Only Abban.

1055
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:23,280
Yes, my Lord.

1056
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:26,950
I am in a game of chess
with my wife and I am losing.

1057
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:30,070
What is the position
of the board, sir?

1058
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:31,860
My king is in check.

1059
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:33,916
Then play your knight.

1060
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:35,240
Even the knight is dead.

1061
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:36,570
Then play the rook.

1062
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:37,926
The rook is also dead.

1063
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:41,470
In that case,
play a new game, sir.

1064
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:43,340
- Play a new game?
- Yes.

1065
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:45,420
And you guys consider
yourself experts at the game?

1066
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,760
I've spent lakhs of rupees
on you guys. Get out of here!

1067
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:50,110
Sit, sit.

1068
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:53,110
What are you playing, my dear?

1069
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:56,550
He asked me to join
him for a game of chess.

1070
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,190
Don't play chess with Mukarram,
my girl.

1071
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:02,020
He plays very well.

1072
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:05,050
Many time he has been invited
to play by the foreigners.

1073
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:07,820
Mukarram please
play your turn fast...

1074
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:10,230
as we're getting late for the meal.

1075
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:12,580
Okay, we'll play
more after eating.

1076
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,500
But now, what move is left?
The game is lost!

1077
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:18,560
Yes.

1078
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:22,170
Oh, okay. You were supposed
to have gone abroad to play.

1079
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,000
Just as well you didn't go...

1080
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:26,010
or you would have
acted thus out there as well!

1081
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:28,520
They would have called
you unsporting.

1082
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:38,010
So now Yusuf has started
to dare hit my sister!

1083
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:41,140
He had wed her for this only?
Chhabban just come with me.

1084
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,360
Chhabban's father?

1085
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:47,486
What is it?

1086
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:50,126
Both the brothers have
gone to thrash up Yusuf.

1087
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:51,250
What?

1088
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:55,190
Look Razia I have
told you many times...

1089
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,960
you should never complain
against your husband.

1090
01:23:58,500 --> 01:23:59,900
Come with me to your home.

1091
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:01,670
No Dad. I will not go.

1092
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,550
- Come on. I'll drop at your home.
- No.

1093
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:05,190
Get up!

1094
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:09,340
Doctor,
what do you advise for diet?

1095
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,700
- Take something light.
- Very well!

1096
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:13,780
Mohammed Ali.

1097
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,140
Yusuf!

1098
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:25,320
Brother Chhabban.

1099
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,710
Why did you raise
a hand to hit Razia?

1100
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:29,806
I never hit her.

1101
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:31,130
You mean she is lying?

1102
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:32,576
Brother Wasim,
I merely scolded her.

1103
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,130
Scolded her? But why?

1104
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,720
She behaved rudely.

1105
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:37,856
You have become very arrogant
after becoming a doctor.

1106
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,280
Come and apologize to her.

1107
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:42,030
Or know that your guts
will be out of your belly!

1108
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:47,690
Look, I've always regarded
you as elder brothers...

1109
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:51,106
but remember I have the same blood
in my veins as you have...

1110
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:53,370
- and now I cannot take this any more.
- What do you say?

1111
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,340
Stop this!

1112
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:58,776
Do not butt in this father!

1113
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,490
Get out! llliterates!

1114
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:01,976
If you are my sons...

1115
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,890
then even Yusuf is the
son of my late brother.

1116
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:05,620
Go and embrace him.

1117
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,060
Go ahead.

1118
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:15,120
Now go back home!

1119
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:17,490
Ill-mannered fools!

1120
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:20,940
Son, I have brought back
Razia again to your house.

1121
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:25,030
Yusuf you must take care of her.
She is illiterate...

1122
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:27,250
but you are educated.

1123
01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:29,210
Uncle, I never did anything to her.

1124
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,960
I expect that only from you!

1125
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:37,730
It seems the Nawab
will not come today either.

1126
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:40,980
So will we have to fly
the kites without him today?

1127
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:42,920
- How will we do that?
- Why?

1128
01:25:43,290 --> 01:25:44,790
Where are the kites
and the strings?

1129
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,950
Oh, you are worried
about kites and strings...

1130
01:25:48,530 --> 01:25:50,490
but since yesterday my
birds are without any feed.

1131
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:52,790
After all, what about
these innocent creatures?

1132
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:54,670
But this had never
happened earlier.

1133
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:58,720
Oh dear.
I hear that the board and...

1134
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:00,960
chess players have been
turned out from service!

1135
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,116
And now it is our turn.

1136
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:05,570
For God's sake do
not speak black words.

1137
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:08,910
So this is all the
doing of the new wife.

1138
01:26:09,010 --> 01:26:10,470
Surely there is no doubt in that.

1139
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:12,410
You people can go away.

1140
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:14,790
The Nawab will not
come outside today either.

1141
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,550
Dear lady, please inform us...

1142
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:21,070
at what time
will the Nawab come...

1143
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:23,660
to the music and dance
sitting in the evening...

1144
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:27,460
so we shall come in time.

1145
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:30,550
Don't bother. He won't
go there, either, today.

1146
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:34,640
But listen, this function
was arranged as per his wish.

1147
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:37,010
So it is cancelled
as per his wish.

1148
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:38,560
Very well.

1149
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:42,620
Did you all see?

1150
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:44,860
Now utter black words!

1151
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:48,970
Come on now.
Why are you sitting?

1152
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,100
Get up!

1153
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:14,590
My lover's eyes are magic arrows.
I surrender myself

1154
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:19,460
My beloved's eyebrows are bows.
I surrender myself!

1155
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:28,710
The eyes' arrows are too much

1156
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:35,970
Those eyelashes
shoot me with spears...

1157
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,500
yet they are the life
of this wounded one

1158
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:03,150
The bow-string is made of love

1159
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:10,260
My heart is like the breeze

1160
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:15,690
The eyes are like the flying kite

1161
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:23,070
My beloved's eyebows are bows.
I surrender myself

1162
01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:27,730
My lover's eyes are magic arrows.
I surrender myself

1163
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:34,880
Left playing the board game...

1164
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:36,990
Left playing the chess game...

1165
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:44,150
only connected to the game of Love

1166
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:18,840
Sir.

1167
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:36,380
Who is the letter from?

1168
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:37,620
Collector.

1169
01:29:38,310 --> 01:29:39,610
What does he write?

1170
01:29:39,970 --> 01:29:42,090
He has written regarding
the revenue from the village.

1171
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,560
Just ask the accountant
to respond to it.

1172
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:46,710
But the letter
is addressed to you.

1173
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,020
Yes it is.

1174
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:50,950
So unless you tell
him what to write back...

1175
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,416
how will the accountant
know what to reply?

1176
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,820
I don't usually bother
with these matters.

1177
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:58,040
These matters of accounts
are too complicated.

1178
01:29:58,140 --> 01:29:59,340
So what?

1179
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:01,110
You can make an effort.

1180
01:30:01,670 --> 01:30:05,780
Go and tell the accountant
that the reply will be sent later.

1181
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:10,270
Please read out the letter to me.
What does it say?

1182
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:13,291
What a trivial matter you're taking up.
Is this the right time for it?

1183
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:17,250
Listen...

1184
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:19,410
today we've forgotten something.

1185
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:20,800
What?

1186
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,220
Chess!

1187
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:25,530
Yes, that's it!
Come on, let's play!

1188
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:27,490
I shall win all the games today!

1189
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:28,980
Hmm, we'll see about that.

1190
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:30,560
Okay, let's see.

1191
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:42,920
Here you are, madam.

1192
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:44,950
Your king is in check.

1193
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:47,190
I seem to be losing
many games today.

1194
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:50,530
You have won many a game too.

1195
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:53,990
Oh yes, even the smartest
of players gets defeated by...

1196
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:56,400
a very small negligible confusion.

1197
01:30:56,810 --> 01:30:58,710
This bloody confusion
is like that only.

1198
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,240
Every game has this rule.

1199
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:03,996
So much so that the game
of life which is considered...

1200
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:08,270
to be the toughest is
lost by the slightest confusion.

1201
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:11,530
Well, what is this game of life?
Pray teach me too!

1202
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:14,520
I am trying to.

1203
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:19,070
Just consider this,
in chess, what to say of the pawn?

1204
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:21,620
Even the king gets
defeated by a wrong move!

1205
01:31:22,130 --> 01:31:23,966
But initially the
mistakes of the pawns...

1206
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:25,900
only lead matters
to the queen and king.

1207
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:27,970
Correct!

1208
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,340
But if the King remains
alert at his own station...

1209
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:36,260
and so does the queen,
and so also the pawns...

1210
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:38,010
Then there is no
question of defeat.

1211
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,070
All will discharge
their own duties.

1212
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:43,160
Yes, and this is the game of life.

1213
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:45,570
Now just consider...

1214
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:49,210
for instance, your accountant.

1215
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:53,780
Let's say he is the queen
and all other employees are pawns.

1216
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:59,120
Whether or not they are performing
their respective duties properly...

1217
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:01,080
else God forbid...

1218
01:32:01,130 --> 01:32:03,540
one day the king is
liable to be in trouble.

1219
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:07,900
And thus the winning game
of life is bound to be lost.

1220
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:10,070
Very correct.

1221
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:11,730
Thanks!

1222
01:32:13,330 --> 01:32:14,770
Today you have opened my eyes.

1223
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:18,470
Don't worry.
Let us finish this game...

1224
01:32:19,130 --> 01:32:20,530
and this one you
are going to win.

1225
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:22,580
We shall play chess later.

1226
01:32:22,730 --> 01:32:24,970
As of today let me take
the accounts from the accountant.

1227
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,000
Oh Lord!

1228
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,980
By your Grace,
today I have won the game forever.

1229
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:40,296
Greetings to you, Sir.

1230
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,416
Greetings.

1231
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,960
Why did sir take the trouble today?

1232
01:32:43,130 --> 01:32:44,530
I have some work with you.

1233
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:46,536
You need money, sir.
It shall be done, sir.

1234
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:47,760
No sir.

1235
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:49,100
Not the money...

1236
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,170
rather I need the
accounts for the money.

1237
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:53,650
Accounts of which money, sir?

1238
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,646
How many years has it been
since my late father passed away?

1239
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:58,766
Four years sir.

1240
01:32:58,790 --> 01:32:59,846
Four years?

1241
01:32:59,870 --> 01:33:01,910
So I need the accounts
only for the last four years.

1242
01:33:02,130 --> 01:33:05,340
But your late Father,
may he rest in heaven...

1243
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:06,866
he never asked
to see any accounts.

1244
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:08,290
But I want to see the accounts.

1245
01:33:09,530 --> 01:33:11,836
Accounts for last three years
have already been submitted, sir.

1246
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:13,796
- For how many days is it remaining?
- Only the current year, sir.

1247
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:15,486
Then let me have the accounts
for this year.

1248
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:16,926
- Then...
- What do you mean by 'then'?

1249
01:33:16,950 --> 01:33:18,150
As you say sir.

1250
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:21,840
Rs. 20,000 came in as revenue...

1251
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:25,820
- of which Rs 3,000 went as taxes.
- Sir.

1252
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:28,656
So why does the
book have an entry...

1253
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,120
of only 15,000 instead of 20,000?

1254
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:32,110
Where is the Rs. 5,000?

1255
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:34,756
Er, perhaps there
is an error in account.

1256
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:35,976
Error in account?

1257
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,960
You've been working for last three hours
yet there's an 'error in account'?

1258
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:41,280
Sir, kindly give
me time till tomorrow.

1259
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:43,140
I have forgotten the
ledger-book at home.

1260
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:45,510
Should it be kept at home home,
or here in the office?

1261
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,720
Sir, kindly give
me time till tomorrow.

1262
01:33:48,910 --> 01:33:50,160
Very well then.

1263
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:53,370
But you will have to produce
the accounts for the Rs. 20,000...

1264
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:55,810
fully tallied and complete.

1265
01:33:56,070 --> 01:33:59,760
Please note that you've been serving
here since my father's time.

1266
01:34:00,230 --> 01:34:02,750
So I am lenient. Otherwise I
would have had you sent to jail.

1267
01:34:03,530 --> 01:34:06,560
And tomorrow if you are unable to
account for the Rs. 20,000...

1268
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:10,570
then for God's sake you
need not come here. Is that clear!

1269
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:19,120
Greetings, madam!

1270
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:21,560
Come Tilak! What brings you here?

1271
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,480
Just came over to see you, madam.

1272
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:27,170
Tilak, I am extremely happy today.

1273
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:29,990
It is a very auspicious day.

1274
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:33,080
Today I have achieved my purpose.

1275
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:37,690
Tilak, you do not look happy.

1276
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,980
Are you not glad in my happiness?

1277
01:34:41,710 --> 01:34:43,730
May the Lord keep you happy,
forever.

1278
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:45,920
But Madam...

1279
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:47,050
Tilak...

1280
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:53,676
But Madam,
you have earned this joy...

1281
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:55,770
after ruining someone's life.

1282
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:58,010
- Yusuf...
- Stop it Tilak.

1283
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:59,700
Again you have
started the same story.

1284
01:34:59,730 --> 01:35:01,030
Leave here.

1285
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:04,670
I say this because he
will listen to none except you.

1286
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,310
Now I cannot say anything to him.

1287
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:07,750
As you wish...

1288
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,956
but you should remember that
he entered into this marriage...

1289
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:11,280
only upon your bidding...

1290
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:14,190
and now in this situation it is
your duty to save his life.

1291
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,000
I very well realize this duty...

1292
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:19,060
but my duty stops me.
I cannot do this.

1293
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:21,790
Tilak I am married. I belong to...

1294
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:23,700
someone now.
Tilak go away. Just go away.

1295
01:35:23,790 --> 01:35:24,890
Madam.

1296
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:30,120
Whenever I remember you...

1297
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:36,300
I feel a pang in my heart

1298
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:42,270
I shed tears, silently...

1299
01:35:44,290 --> 01:35:48,690
while the world sleeps

1300
01:35:51,030 --> 01:35:55,170
To whom can I tell my tale of woe?

1301
01:35:59,910 --> 01:36:02,450
None can share my misery

1302
01:36:07,710 --> 01:36:15,710
Oh come. Oh come.
My heart is not at peace

1303
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:22,680
Someone waits for you...

1304
01:36:24,510 --> 01:36:28,140
desperate with his life

1305
01:36:35,610 --> 01:36:37,730
Slowly...

1306
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:46,290
slowly tread the path in love

1307
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:54,960
You may not lose.
The path is very tough

1308
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:08,040
Are you remembering someone?

1309
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:20,910
Pain is written on your face

1310
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:32,340
Wipe those tears from your eyes

1311
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:40,980
Do not feel miserable, my lord

1312
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:55,840
Slowly, slowly
tread the path of love

1313
01:37:56,580 --> 01:38:04,580
You may not lose.
The path is very tough

1314
01:38:09,170 --> 01:38:11,250
Slowly, slowly

1315
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:16,820
Razia, come here.

1316
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:20,150
You called for me?

1317
01:38:22,490 --> 01:38:24,280
Or is it my imagination?

1318
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:26,030
Yes, I did call for you.
Please come here.

1319
01:38:32,590 --> 01:38:33,690
Please sit.

1320
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:36,076
What?

1321
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:37,200
Yes, please sit down.

1322
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:41,770
Today I want to take
a decision with you.

1323
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,800
Decision?
Why do you need me for it?

1324
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:48,100
Do whatever you feel like doing.

1325
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:51,540
More than I, you are
needed for this decision.

1326
01:38:53,390 --> 01:38:55,370
Really? Then tell me.

1327
01:38:58,050 --> 01:39:01,150
You are aware that we have
to lead this life together...

1328
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:03,400
and in this very house.

1329
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:05,740
I am aware.

1330
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:08,441
Now it is up to you, whether
you make this house a hell...

1331
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:10,240
or live here peacefully.

1332
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:22,520
You want to take a decision
orally or from the heart?

1333
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:24,900
From the heart.

1334
01:39:24,930 --> 01:39:27,480
Decisions can be taken
by heart only when...

1335
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:31,430
you throw away the
memory of someone from there.

1336
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:36,010
Look Razia, my mind
is at its wit's end...

1337
01:39:36,980 --> 01:39:40,110
because of your 24-hour nagging.

1338
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:42,300
I cannot do any work, anywhere.

1339
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,360
My practice is halved.

1340
01:39:45,450 --> 01:39:47,770
I am ill-famed in
town for my confusion.

1341
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:51,340
None except you
has a remedy for this.

1342
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:57,440
I am prepared to treat you,
but just tell me...

1343
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:01,480
have you ever tried
to cure my wounded heart...

1344
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,150
or have you always
been rubbing salt on it?

1345
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:08,320
I know you are my husband.

1346
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:10,600
I know very well my duty.

1347
01:40:11,170 --> 01:40:12,570
But I'm helpless.

1348
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:15,740
Have you ever realized
that I am your wife?

1349
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:18,580
Have you ever addressed
me lovingly as Razia?

1350
01:40:19,110 --> 01:40:21,020
You are forever lost
in just one thought.

1351
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:23,970
You mean I should see
my house being destroyed and...

1352
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:25,640
not even utter a sigh?

1353
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:27,650
Razia! Just listen.

1354
01:40:28,570 --> 01:40:30,360
Would you prefer
we not reach any decision?

1355
01:40:30,730 --> 01:40:32,430
Both our lives
may remain a living hell?

1356
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:34,126
Don't act crazy
and don't make me crazy either.

1357
01:40:34,150 --> 01:40:35,570
Call me crazy or whatever.

1358
01:40:35,830 --> 01:40:39,320
I have become mad and
I will make you mad too.

1359
01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:44,370
I'll enjoy it when this house burns.
We two mad ones will also burn...

1360
01:40:44,590 --> 01:40:45,990
and I'll laugh like mad.

1361
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:02,060
- You did not give them medicine.
- You were absent.

1362
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:03,580
Repeat yesterday's dose.

1363
01:41:03,610 --> 01:41:05,010
Doctor, I want to say something.

1364
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,936
I shall not see anyone today.
You all repeat yesterday's dose.

1365
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,580
- Doctor...
Take yesterday's medicine!

1366
01:41:09,710 --> 01:41:14,340
Bless me that I made
you a hearty romantic!

1367
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:15,810
Bedil...

1368
01:41:17,550 --> 01:41:20,170
Bedil, right now I am
in no mood for fun. Just go away.

1369
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:25,956
Have you lost your
head completely, my dear?

1370
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:27,650
I say, you had better go home now.

1371
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:32,700
Else you will kill me?

1372
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:34,040
Stop joking.

1373
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:39,980
I am very serious,
and you call it joke.

1374
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:42,920
Better go home and say
these serious things. Go.

1375
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:46,270
Yusuf, come to your senses.

1376
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:48,380
I'm senseless and
want to remain so.

1377
01:41:48,410 --> 01:41:52,800
I won't let you be senseless.
You are my only friend.

1378
01:41:53,070 --> 01:41:55,880
Today there's no other doctor
as important as you in town.

1379
01:41:56,150 --> 01:41:57,550
I'm proud of this.

1380
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:01,750
You have toiled for this position
just so that you may waste it thus...

1381
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,720
squander it for a useless thing...

1382
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:06,600
that you can never
get come what may?

1383
01:42:06,850 --> 01:42:09,376
Stop this nonsense. I don't want
to hear this. Go away from here.

1384
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,610
I shall not go till I
bring you back to your senses.

1385
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:13,200
You'll bring me to my senses?

1386
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:24,870
Yusuf sir, madam is unwell.
They have sent for you.

1387
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:26,380
I won't come.

1388
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:27,766
The nawab has called you.

1389
01:42:27,790 --> 01:42:29,086
I won't go anywhere.

1390
01:42:29,110 --> 01:42:30,680
Yusuf sir,
the junior madam is sick.

1391
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:32,760
- What?
- Najma is unwell.

1392
01:42:33,570 --> 01:42:34,870
- Najma?
- Yes.

1393
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,160
I shall come along. Let's go.

1394
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:42,100
Come doctor.
I was waiting for you.

1395
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:43,940
Please come.

1396
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:03,440
Mukarram,
let him see the pulse urgently.

1397
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:06,460
Very well.

1398
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:20,420
I have the thermometer.

1399
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:24,260
Here.

1400
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:50,340
Doctor?

1401
01:43:50,510 --> 01:43:51,610
Yusuf?

1402
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:53,380
I shall immediately
go and get the medicine.

1403
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:01,870
I sing...

1404
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:07,440
sing in joy

1405
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:21,080
I wipe away all the woes

1406
01:44:28,590 --> 01:44:32,060
I make the weeping ones smile

1407
01:44:32,220 --> 01:44:38,460
He would call me.
I would not go to him

1408
01:44:42,180 --> 01:44:45,990
I would tease him some more.
I sing

1409
01:45:04,330 --> 01:45:10,180
Come hear the story
of the world from me

1410
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:22,740
Misery is the old age of the heart...

1411
01:45:27,210 --> 01:45:30,570
and joys its youth

1412
01:45:34,170 --> 01:45:37,320
Then why should I not sing?

1413
01:45:40,540 --> 01:45:41,940
I sing...

1414
01:45:44,910 --> 01:45:47,370
sing in joy

1415
01:45:55,650 --> 01:45:56,950
You liked my song?

1416
01:45:57,190 --> 01:45:58,590
Very good. Sing some more.

1417
01:46:09,410 --> 01:46:11,210
Madam, I am always scared...

1418
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:14,220
some day you may
not utter my name for all...

1419
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:16,110
that I have told
you in confidence.

1420
01:46:16,530 --> 01:46:18,480
Even if I were to say,
who would believe it?

1421
01:46:18,570 --> 01:46:21,110
Well Madam,
the entire town knows...

1422
01:46:21,390 --> 01:46:23,830
that I am to be
wed to Nawazish Ali

1423
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:27,970
- Okay, tell me something.
- Yes?

1424
01:46:28,860 --> 01:46:31,980
When I saw Nawazish Ali
standing outside the garden...

1425
01:46:32,950 --> 01:46:35,510
was Najma herself
talking to him, or...

1426
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:39,040
No Ma'am, the messages
were exchanged, though.

1427
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:41,656
I have heard other news.

1428
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:42,780
What?

1429
01:46:42,820 --> 01:46:47,500
Nawazish Ali came this morning.
He said Najma is seriously ill...

1430
01:46:48,550 --> 01:46:51,710
and Mr. Yusuf is laboring
hard for her treatment.

1431
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:59,600
Get my palanquin.

1432
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:01,850
Go.

1433
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:15,110
Najma.

1434
01:47:15,650 --> 01:47:18,310
God forbid. How is your health?

1435
01:47:19,620 --> 01:47:22,230
I am okay, by your good wishes.

1436
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:26,660
Except for wishing well,
what else can we do?

1437
01:47:27,170 --> 01:47:30,840
What do we poor folks
have that we can give you?

1438
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:34,870
Wherever we see friendly
folks we pray for their good.

1439
01:47:35,570 --> 01:47:37,820
Your good wishes
are very valuable.

1440
01:47:39,170 --> 01:47:42,580
Don't say that.
Along with good wishes...

1441
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,550
my husband's medicines
are also very valuable.

1442
01:47:46,630 --> 01:47:49,290
I would like to give you
some good wishes, in private...

1443
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:52,100
so please ask these
ladies to leave us alone.

1444
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:54,820
I hope you don't mind.

1445
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:07,170
Sir, please do not go inside.

1446
01:48:07,490 --> 01:48:08,590
Why not?

1447
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:10,860
Mr. Yusuf's wife has come.

1448
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:14,500
Yes?

1449
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:16,560
Now tell me.

1450
01:48:18,370 --> 01:48:19,940
I am wondering...

1451
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:26,660
do I begin the tale of my destroyed
home and your kindness on me...

1452
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:29,920
right from beginning
or from the recent times?

1453
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:35,610
You mean to say,
I have destroyed your home?

1454
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:39,450
No, no,
you are absolutely innocent.

1455
01:48:39,870 --> 01:48:44,530
This is like the proverbial dame
who ignites a spark and stands back.

1456
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:48,780
Razia, you misunderstand.
Some foe has misinformed you.

1457
01:48:49,180 --> 01:48:52,920
Najma, you initially started
the spark while I kept quiet.

1458
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:57,520
But I notice that the sparks of
your beauty still burn my house.

1459
01:48:58,310 --> 01:48:59,790
What do you want to say?

1460
01:49:00,410 --> 01:49:02,480
That now you will yourself
have to burn, too...

1461
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:04,280
in the same fire started by you.

1462
01:49:04,450 --> 01:49:07,780
Before the wedding you kept
meeting with Tilak. I never did mind.

1463
01:49:07,890 --> 01:49:08,990
Razia...

1464
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:12,100
he loved you or you loved him.
I never did mind.

1465
01:49:12,470 --> 01:49:14,480
- Razia...
- But now you have no right to...

1466
01:49:14,510 --> 01:49:18,460
instigate this fire more
under the guise of your illness.

1467
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:19,640
Razia!

1468
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,400
Why have you called me?

1469
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,600
Just relax for a while.
I shall tell you.

1470
01:49:48,350 --> 01:49:51,300
I don't have leisure.
Nor do I wish to meet you.

1471
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:52,800
Bedil...

1472
01:49:54,050 --> 01:49:57,200
I need to apologize.
That day I raised a hand on you...

1473
01:49:57,690 --> 01:49:58,990
I wasn't in my senses.

1474
01:49:59,850 --> 01:50:01,210
I went many times to your place...

1475
01:50:01,290 --> 01:50:02,590
but could not meet you.

1476
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:04,330
Please pardon me my friend.

1477
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,490
Cut out that nonsense,
else I shall give you one.

1478
01:50:08,660 --> 01:50:10,380
It is too hot. Take off your cap.

1479
01:50:13,550 --> 01:50:15,450
You want to hit me?
Come do it.

1480
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:26,200
Yes.

1481
01:50:26,970 --> 01:50:28,070
What?

1482
01:50:28,130 --> 01:50:30,360
Yes. Yusuf sir,
you must leave there right away.

1483
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:33,030
Mukarram Nawab is coming
there with a pistol to kill you.

1484
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:34,610
Go somewhere quickly.

1485
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:37,330
What is it?

1486
01:50:37,850 --> 01:50:39,790
Mukarram is coming
with a pistol to kill you.

1487
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:42,126
Mukarram is coming
with a pistol to kill me?

1488
01:50:42,150 --> 01:50:43,250
Yes.

1489
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:46,230
Then let him come.
Who is afraid here?

1490
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:48,900
Don't be crazy.
Come along come with me.

1491
01:50:49,540 --> 01:50:52,500
That is not possible.
Now I'll be alone here.

1492
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:58,100
Do you want to die?

1493
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:02,340
I died the day
Najma got married.

1494
01:51:06,450 --> 01:51:09,230
Come with me or I'll
kill you and myself too.

1495
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:12,440
That's the same thing, Mr.
You'll kill me or not.

1496
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:18,030
Yusuf, come.
For God's sake come.

1497
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:20,880
You are my friend.
I won't let you die.

1498
01:51:20,910 --> 01:51:22,470
Are you so scared about my death?

1499
01:51:22,530 --> 01:51:24,250
My dear, death is heaven.

1500
01:51:24,510 --> 01:51:28,800
Yusuf don't be obstinate.
For God's sake come.

1501
01:51:51,930 --> 01:51:54,190
There is no hope left.
An operation is useless.

1502
01:51:54,330 --> 01:51:55,630
You please try.

1503
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:57,770
I have already examined.
There is no hope.

1504
01:51:58,030 --> 01:51:59,230
You, doctor?

1505
01:51:59,330 --> 01:52:01,450
Now the operation is useless.
Nothing can be done.

1506
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:04,690
Doctor, I am ready
to give away all my wealth.

1507
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:06,420
For God's sake cure him back.

1508
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:10,850
Nawab, sir, wealth can
buy you everything except life.

1509
01:52:11,310 --> 01:52:12,840
I am sorry. I am helpless.

1510
01:52:14,050 --> 01:52:15,150
Helpless.

1511
01:52:19,390 --> 01:52:21,420
Yusuf, Yusuf has not come!

1512
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:24,780
Is Dr. Yusuf there?

1513
01:52:24,850 --> 01:52:26,250
Hello? Dr. Yusuf?

1514
01:52:27,650 --> 01:52:29,850
Oh, Nawab sir? Tell me?

1515
01:52:30,530 --> 01:52:32,740
Yusuf, my child, why have
you not come till now?

1516
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:34,770
Mukarram's condition
is so critical...

1517
01:52:35,290 --> 01:52:36,810
you will have
to perform the operation.

1518
01:52:37,110 --> 01:52:38,510
All the other doctors have refused.

1519
01:52:38,950 --> 01:52:40,250
Please come immediately.

1520
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:42,810
Sir, it's better if the operation
is performed at the hospital.

1521
01:52:43,010 --> 01:52:44,880
No, the operation
will take place at home.

1522
01:52:45,310 --> 01:52:46,510
You come right away.

1523
01:52:46,910 --> 01:52:48,910
Okay, I'll be right there.

1524
01:52:54,570 --> 01:52:55,670
595.

1525
01:52:57,610 --> 01:52:59,450
Hello? It is me, Dr. Yusuf.

1526
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:03,170
All instruments,
nurses, oxygen, etc...

1527
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:07,960
for the operation must be sent immediately
to Mukarram Nawab's residence.

1528
01:53:09,090 --> 01:53:12,150
Yes, yes,
I am operating. Send it now.

1529
01:53:25,030 --> 01:53:30,040
Why are you doing this operation?
Is there no other doctor in town?

1530
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:31,820
All other doctors have given up.

1531
01:53:32,370 --> 01:53:34,256
The Nawab insists that
I should do the operation.

1532
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:36,200
Why do you drag the Nawab's name?

1533
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:38,380
Najma must have asked you.

1534
01:53:38,610 --> 01:53:40,670
Razia, you have crossed all limits.

1535
01:53:41,420 --> 01:53:43,340
This is a question
of life or death for a person.

1536
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:45,520
For a doctor there can
be nothing greater than this.

1537
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:47,340
Move! I don't have time.

1538
01:53:48,450 --> 01:53:52,020
Not a question of life,
only of death.

1539
01:53:52,530 --> 01:53:53,630
What nonsense!

1540
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:55,430
Not nonsense. I speak the truth.

1541
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:57,790
After ages you have
now got the opportunity.

1542
01:53:58,250 --> 01:54:02,220
You and Najma have together
planned to kill Mukarram.

1543
01:54:02,550 --> 01:54:05,200
Afterwards, the coast
will be clear for you both.

1544
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:06,760
Villain, go away.

1545
01:54:08,730 --> 01:54:10,076
You cannot do the operation.

1546
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:12,250
Leave me, else the patient may die.
I don't have time.

1547
01:54:12,410 --> 01:54:15,280
If you go there, I shall
tell the senior Nawab that...

1548
01:54:15,450 --> 01:54:17,340
you want to kill Mukarram.

1549
01:54:17,510 --> 01:54:19,230
- I say leave me.
- No.

1550
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:40,070
You all please move aside.

1551
01:54:40,350 --> 01:54:41,990
Preparations for
operation are going on.

1552
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:47,800
No point in crying.
This is delicate.

1553
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:01,190
Mr. Yusuf, you came too late.

1554
01:55:01,890 --> 01:55:03,290
What happened, Yusuf?

1555
01:55:03,610 --> 01:55:06,030
Nothing. I had fallen
on the staircase in my hurry.

1556
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:08,260
- Where is Mukarram.
- Come.

1557
01:55:09,190 --> 01:55:13,500
Yusuf, you're that father's son
who was my great friend.

1558
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,540
And I feel towards you
as I do my son.

1559
01:55:17,370 --> 01:55:19,140
God has given me just
one daughter.

1560
01:55:19,770 --> 01:55:22,410
Please try that
her life is not ruined.

1561
01:55:24,430 --> 01:55:27,150
Yusuf, sir, the young mistress
wants to tell you something.

1562
01:55:27,330 --> 01:55:28,526
Tell her I'm in a hurry.

1563
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:30,590
Tell him that I shall
take back my husband from him.

1564
01:55:31,010 --> 01:55:34,690
Tell her I am not God. But
By God I shall spare no effort.

1565
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:52,620
Mukarram...

1566
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:54,760
I just want to say one thing.

1567
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:57,900
Perhaps you do not know that...

1568
01:56:58,270 --> 01:56:59,670
every doctor
has given up on you.

1569
01:57:01,830 --> 01:57:04,020
But I was ready to
take this major risk and...

1570
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:06,500
agreed to operate upon you.

1571
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:11,520
Only so that if by God's
grace you become well again...

1572
01:57:13,430 --> 01:57:15,910
then I may be able to clear this
misunderstanding in your mind.

1573
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:18,340
Najma is innocent.

1574
01:57:19,570 --> 01:57:20,770
She is yours.

1575
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:23,350
She loves only you.

1576
01:57:25,470 --> 01:57:27,020
If you still don't believe this...

1577
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:30,560
then here is the pistol...

1578
01:57:32,890 --> 01:57:34,090
and here am I.

1579
01:57:58,350 --> 01:58:01,690
Tell her, congratulations,
the operation has been a success.

1580
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:12,350
Yusuf...

1581
01:58:12,660 --> 01:58:14,880
Congratulations,
the operation was successful.

1582
01:58:15,260 --> 01:58:17,370
Yusuf, God knows...

1583
01:58:18,590 --> 01:58:20,310
you have done me
a favor that cannot...

1584
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:23,210
be forgotten in my entire life.

1585
01:58:23,990 --> 01:58:25,290
What are you saying, sir?

1586
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:27,120
I have always taken
favors from you.

1587
01:58:28,050 --> 01:58:29,620
I have just done my duty.

1588
01:58:49,230 --> 01:58:50,630
So finally you have killed?

1589
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:52,240
No, the operation was successful.

1590
01:58:52,860 --> 01:58:54,160
I am going to meet Razia.

1591
01:58:54,190 --> 01:58:56,800
Now you are going to
see her when she has died.

1592
01:58:57,110 --> 01:58:58,210
She's died?

1593
01:58:59,380 --> 01:59:00,580
How can that be possible?

1594
01:59:02,420 --> 01:59:06,150
I just came from there.
While dying she said...

1595
01:59:06,660 --> 01:59:08,870
'please ask my
master to forgive me'.

1596
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:10,740
'My misunderstanding is cleared'.

1597
01:59:11,130 --> 01:59:12,430
'It was all my fault'.

1598
01:59:13,510 --> 01:59:14,710
Now what is there?

1599
01:59:15,810 --> 01:59:18,550
If she were alive
I would have pardoned her.

1600
01:59:19,450 --> 01:59:23,690
Still, Yusuf, please pardon her.
The dead lady's soul will be at peace.

1601
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:27,830
Just once say that
you have pardoned her.

1602
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:32,280
Razia, I have pardoned you.

1603
01:59:34,550 --> 01:59:35,850
My God has pardoned you.

1604
01:59:35,910 --> 01:59:38,230
My lord and master, if you
have pardoned me then come home!

1605
01:59:39,110 --> 01:59:46,410
Bless me, that I made
you a hearty romantic.
