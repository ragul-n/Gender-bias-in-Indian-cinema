Kiss is planted With love.

00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,412
Kiss Won't generate love.

12
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:34,622

Hey SWetha? You and Uday...

TomorroW morning?

44
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,604
Routine problem.
Don't you've any other solution?

45
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,799
This is not routine problem,
SWetha's dad is the Home Minister.

46
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,675
Moreover he's encounter specialist.

47
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,948
SWetha's marriage and
our death Will happen at a time.

48
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,210
That's the real point of interest.
Why are you guys Worrying?

49
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,649
lt's my plan and l'm taking the risk.

50
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,153
What's in love?
Any fool can fall in love.

51
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:42,885
l mean you must have guts to go
against everyone and marry them off.

52
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,689
All l've is guts.

53
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,835
Tell me! Surprized,
Why you haven't yet named me?

54
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,364
Nothing much,

55
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,971
just hide SWetha and Uday in
your home tonight, that's all.

56
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,769
Home Minister is your family friend,
so he'll not suspect you.

57
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,003
Will it Work out?

58
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,843
Just noW reached Sandy's house.

59
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,290
Going to a party at Srinath uncle's
place, Why notjoin us?

60
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,983
No Way! He'll kill With the old tale
of his making it big time.

61
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,620
l can't tolerate it.
- Okay, l asked you just like that.

62
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,739
They are safe, let's go.
TomorroW morning at 6 am, Sandy.

63
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:37,044
You guys don't get out of bed by 10 am also,
What are you planning to do at 6 am?

64
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:43,054
Anyway he'll not get a job,
he has decided to Watch birds.

65
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,085
Shall We go?

66
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,098
l've a small suggestion for you.
- What?

67
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,563
Looks like your sleeve is getting
smaller With passing time.

68
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,165
l'll listen if my husband tells,
not you.

69
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,408
Gopi couldn't tell you directly
and sought my help to tell you.

70
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,507
ls it true, Gopi?- What's this?
- ls it true?

71
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,182
He's creating unnecessary trouble
and you believe him! He'll...

72
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,853
HoW you've raised your son?
- You raised him.

73
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,597
Why are you so Worried?
lt's me!

74
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,933
She left her home for me,
can't you get it?

75
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,104
HoW much my dad Will get tensed
and shake up the entire state?

76
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,072
Mere thought of it
is giving me jitters.

77
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,439
Don't get tensed,
everything Will go on smoothly.

78
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,078
Be careful.

79
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,518
Did you find the man Who cut a girl's
throat for not acknoWledging his love?

80
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,054
Found him sir.
But died in an encounter...

81
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,624
He died! That's all?
- Yes sir.

82
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,818
l'm Worried about repercussions.

83
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,726
We are in trouble if We fail
to find him or if he's killed.

84
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,401
Don't spare such rogues
under any circumstances.

85
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:08,135
Entire state's youth must Wet their
pants on hearing about love.

86
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,398
Got me?

87
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,070
Come in Sandeep!
When did you come?

88
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,246
l didn't see you.

89
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,779
lt seems you got a job in America.

90
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,515
Your dad told me,
please take your seat.

91
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,181
lt's cool to celebrate,
have a drink.

92
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:28,087
That's respect!
That's Why l like you so much.

93
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,691
Where is SWetha?

94
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,794
Didn't she come With you?

95
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,261
SWetha Will never come home.

96
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:37,602
What did you say?

97
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,930
Can We go in and talk personally?

98
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:42,965
No problem, carry on.

99
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,277
SWetha has eloped With
my friend Uday.

100
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,970
What the hell are you saying, bloody?

101
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:58,154
You knoW Who l am, right?
Where is SWetha? Tell me!

102
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,619
SWetha is With Uday, uncle.

103
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,619
lf l book you under any case,
your career is finished.

104
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:08,625
l knoW that very Well,
that's Why l came to you, uncle.

105
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,566
As a father your anger and
hurt is justified.

106
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,467
As the Home Minister, you can find
SWetha using your network.

107
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,838
You'll get her married again
even if she's married.

108
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,705
You'll have Uday get killed
in some encounter.

109
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,904
Am l right?
- You're right.

110
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,650
Doesn't your friend has
this common sense?

111
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,081
Go and tell him about
my poWer and reach.

112
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:32,485
Before l tell them about your poWer,
you must knoW their love poWer.

113
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,352
What should l knoW about it neWly?

114
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,826
No need to use your intelligence
department to find SWetha and Uday.

115
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,432
Just use your intelligence to knoW
Who is Uday, that's enough.

116
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,234
You've crossed our age,
just go back again and think.

117
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,167
Have you come here to give me
a ride on time machine?

118
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,274
l'll kill you, bloody!

119
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,341
You can kill anything born on this earth,

120
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:04,853
but one can never kill love,
notjust men even God can't kill it.

121
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,496
Where is Sandy?
Still under rugs?

122
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,222
Didn't turn up from last night?
That's Worrying me.

123
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,030
Look, Sandy is here.

124

That's like my grandson!

medicine dose, grandma?

137

Oh no!

Will he like her?

144
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,668
Why are you looking at
photos early morning?

145
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,504
To select a photo for
the poster, right?

146
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,734
Why are you taking sudden
interest in my publicity?

147
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,040
Who amongst them is
very close to you?

148
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,174
Close?

149
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,453
lf l get close to one,
others Will unite to kill me.

150
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,122
That's Why l'm very close
With all of them.

151
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:22,322
lsn't it difficult With Whole bunch?
You must be close With only one.

152
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,621
HoW can he understand

00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,051
l thought it'll be very difficult
to get his acceptance.

160

l never expected he'll
agree so easily.

161
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,250

live alone in America.

162

We'll talk to her parents.
- Yes, We Will. See!

That's Why this photo exhibition.
They all are just friends.

166
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,000

00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,506
ls it international problem?

169
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,182
You select a bride for me,
l'll marry her.

170
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:22,012
What?
- You select and l'll marry.

171
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:26,283
Will you go for an arranged marriage
instead of love marriage?

172
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,121
There's something fishy in it.

173
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:33,961
He's alWays in pubs and parties,
hoW can he be Without a girl friend?

174
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,428
Something is not right.

175
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,261
Going to pubs don't mean
l must have girl friends.

176
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,169
Don't l Want a girl friend?

177
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,866
l haven't met a girl Who could
make me skip a beat.

178
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,137
So l've decided to marry
the girl of your choice.

179
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,972
To Which bygone era do you belong?

180
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:55,210
30 years ago l and your dad
fell in love, eloped to marry.

181
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,447
Born in fast generation,
Will you go for an arranged marriage?

182
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,183
ls arranged marriage taboo
for the fast generation?

183
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,954
Why? You Want to curse us
all your life.

184
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,690
Vasu, you remember, last year
l bought a shirt for his birthday,

185
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,458
he threW it on my face,

186
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:15,066
When he didn't like my surprize gift,
Will he like my selected lifetime gift?

187
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,868
You're right, you don't knoW
about latest fashion,

188
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,737
don't knoW about latest trends,

189
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,972
shirts or cell phones can be
exchanged or left unused,

190
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,741
but life partner isn't like that,

191
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,681
must be very careful While selecting,

192
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,720
l fear my selection may go
Wrong in tension,

193
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,381
so l'm leaving that
responsibility on you both.

194
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:41,856
By any chance are We responsible
for refusing love marriage?

195
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:47,170
What's your opinion about
our married life?

196
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,839
l think l Was in eight class,

197
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,740
one night you threW a chapatti on
mother's face for not in round shape,

198
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,813
mummy Wasn't any less,
she hit you back With a spatula.

199
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,506
lt lead to big trouble.

200
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,278
You shoWed me lraq War in home.

201
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,081
That night sister Sindhu
and l never slept.

202
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,192
We entered hall next morning
fearing terrible but...

203
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,789
The scene Was completely different.

204
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,128
Both Were happily talking to each other
as if nothing had happened last night.

205
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:22,032
Still l can't understand hoW you
both compromised that night.

206
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,037
Apart from those little arguments,

207
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:28,201
l haven't seen any couple more
understanding than you.

208
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,210
l too Want to be like you.

209
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,914
What happened to you then?

210
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,814
We expected you Will
bring a princess,

211
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,386
but you've left the responsibility
of finding a bride on us.

212
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,887
You played some trick
and trapped mom.

213
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,659
You got lucky, croW.

214
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,420
Anyway l'm not as talented
as you are, Gopi.

215
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:51,594
lf Vasu had brothers like me then,
you Would've got the stick.

216
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:56,263
Why not noW? You come to beat me
for eloping With your mother.

217
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:02,241
l did What l ought to then,
that's Why you're here noW.

218
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,988
Who are you guys?
Why are you standing there only?

219
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,659
My boss Won't step out until
inauspicious time elapses.

220
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,257
lnauspicious time has elapsed!

221
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,193
Who are you?

222
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,528

You've guessed it right, boss.

00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,649
l can judge by reading the faces.

That's Why, l never shoW the

ShoW it to the groom only.

You decide it.
- Why should l decide?

280
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:43,897
You decide in Which element
you'll become a part of it.

281
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,831
Why should l become part of it?

282

So, no one to shed a tear also.
So, l can kill you immediately.

First you relax.

288

What's this mom?

289
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:21,869
ls this the Way to find a bride?

290
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,338
When l could broWse internet
and find a job,

291
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,704
can't l chat and find a bride for myself?

292
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,014
This is not right.

293
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,218
Go personally and find a bride for me.

294
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,182
Birth or death isn't in our hands,

295
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:45,052
marriage is the only occasion
We choose ourselves,

296
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:50,361
We mustn't miss the happiness and
festivities accompanying it.

297
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:10,781
What We couldn't give to our parents 30
years ago, he has given us an opportunity,

298
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,185
We must keep his trust.

299
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:32,539
l've seen love failures taking to drinks,
Why are you drinking after marriage?

300
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,468
Not only him, l too Want to drink.

301
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,478
When you both had same tastes
before marriage, l Was surprized,

302
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:39,547
is it this one?

303
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,180
What happened?
- We don't have any problem. lt's you!

304
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,047
Do you knoW What he's doing?

305
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:49,749
He has almost stopped drinking, right?

306
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:51,754
Shut up!

307
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:55,126
Sandy is going for an
arranged marriage!

308
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:57,931
Bloody!

309
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,697
lt's my marriage.
Why are you guys shocked?

310
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,941
We had great expectations on
your love marriage,

311
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,270
that you Will elope With
CM or PM's daughter,

312
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,004
bomb blasts and hot chases,
l had great plans for your marriage.

313
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,547
So many girls are sWooning over you,

314
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,413
Why are you going for
an arranged marriage?

315
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:20,285
You'll not knoW What you're
missing is the thrill of love.

316
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,459
Love is not a thrill but
a great feeling.

317
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,654
Don't shut me up.

318
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:30,062
ln my opinion When two people like
each other at the same time, it's love.

319
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,964
ls it any accident When two
vehicles hit at the same time?

320
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:37,073
First you like someone,
it Will turn into love later.

321
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,971
Yuck! l can't fall in love
for the sake of love.

322
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,406
l must get that feeling.

323
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,681
When l see a beautiful girl,
l feel just a WoW!

324
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,613
l don't get the feel, love!

325
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:52,154
You knoW the advantages
of love marriage?

326
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,587
You'll knoW What your Wife
likes before itself.

327
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,125
Wife can knoW What food
husband likes before itself.

328
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,888
Family background and
bank balances Will be clear.

329
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,829
lt's not in arranged marriages.
Will you be happy With it?

330
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:07,831
Correct! l never thought in this angle.

331
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,838
l may be Wrong in deciding this.

332
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,745
Your parents' marriage is
love marriage, right?- No.

333
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,273
Your parents?
- No.

334
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,281
Arranged?

335
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,920
HoW can there be understanding
between your parents then?

336
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:25,817
Aren't they fighting each other everyday?

337
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,685
Aren't their lives full of problems?
Tell me.

338
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:30,793
Can't you understand after seeing us?
That they are very happy.

339
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:31,787
That's it.

340
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,488
Can't you understand hoW successful
my parents' love marriage is after seeing me?

341
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,166
Not only that my sister's too
is love marriage.

342
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:42,931
So, l respect and like love
marriages more than you all.

343
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:47,475
Whether it's arranged or love marriage,
there are bound to be some failures.

344
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,738
Problem isn't in the marriage.

345
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,917
lt's in understanding each other
and finding true love.

346
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:56,609
Then, Why don't you fall in love?
- Don't l Want to fall in love?

347
00:30:56,821 --> 00:31:00,052
Till noW l never had that magic feeling.

348
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:04,058
So, l left the choice to my parents
Who understand me best.

349
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,787
But till noW you said
you'll do anything for love.

00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,137
Sister, please shoW me.

Let him see it.

Mother, you tell her.

360
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,455
On one condition,
if your brother-in-laW gets promotion,

361
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,997
you must Walk to Tirumala
and tonsure your head. Okay?

362

Grandma! According to tradition
When should a groom see the bride?

381
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:06,982
According to tradition, my grandfather saW
my grandmother in marriage canopy.

382
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,244
Fantastic idea!
l'll also see her there only.

383
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:15,617
This is more thrilling than love marriage.

384
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:19,123
l'm sure he's gone crazy.
He's gone crazy.

My marriage should also happen
like the one in this photograph.

387
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,243
What?
Like my grandmother's marriage?

388
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:38,074
You're asking a marriage that
Was celebrated 100 years ago.

389
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,441
lt Was a 16 day long
marriage festivities!

390
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,049
ln that marriage Was 5 days affair.
- 5 days!

391
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,049
Grandma's marriage!

392
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,419
A big marriage canopy!

393
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:49,854
A vast pedestal!

394
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,688
Brothers...sisters!

395
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:55,161
Aunts...uncles!
Paternal aunts...maternal uncles!

396
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,631
lt used be a grand spectacle!

397
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,962
5 days marriage?

398
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,902
Mummy, my marriage also
must be like that.

399
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,636
5 days?

400
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,501
Can relatives stay for so long?

401
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,349
Why not?
Can't our relatives do this for us?

402
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:17,647
Just one day is quite difficult,
5 days is practically impossible.

403
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,748
l'll put a ring to some girl
in America and kiss her.

404
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,655
Marriage Will be over in seconds.
- No please.

405
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,156
Let's go for 5 day marriage
as you Wish.

l didn't understand When he
turned cross While delivering him,

408
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,336
though he's groWn up,
he's still like that only.

409
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:48,051
Grandpa! - So, you're learning to
be a householder.

410
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,410
This is my childhood style.

411
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,953
lf any guests come l used
to give Water to Wash legs.

412
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,216
You're also doing the same.
Little bit trendy noW.

Though nearing a century,
you're still very strong.

00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,261
What's the secret of your health?

417
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,903
My grandson gives me
medicine three times a day.

418
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,905
That's the secret.
- Medicine? What's that? Give us also.

419
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,066
You too Want it?
Here it is!

420
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:14,904
This is it!

00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,416
Thank God! You've come!

422
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:21,950
Father-in-laW.

423
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,121
Welcome, uncle.
- Can't bear him anymore, aunt?

He Wants every relative

00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,659
Why are you so adamant?

427

l've given her all the addresses l knoW.

428
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,258
They are running around.

429
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,431
lnfact l got married taking
half day leave from office.

430
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,396
Would anyone go to attend someone
else's marriage taking a Week off?

431
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,369
l don't care about all that,
l'll marry only everyone makes to it.

432
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,735
lf not l'll cancel it.

438
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,287

Creadits Goes to IsaiThai.com [IsaiMannan]

443
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:30,019
l expected you'll go at
jet speed like Allu Arjun,

444
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:33,486
l didn't expect you'll plan systematically
like Allu Ramalingaiah.

445
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,885
My friends too tell the same thing.

446
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:36,957
Why youth like you is going
backWards in time?

447
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:40,324
lt's not going back,
it's bringing back the olden times.

448
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,557
To say it in simple term, recycle!

449
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:49,429
Where life begins, after some time
it must reach the starting point.

450
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:55,740
Granny, have cool drink.
You didn't have anything since afternoon.

451
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,104
You're very caring about me.

452
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,648
First day chief guest,
second day ordinary guest,

453
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,012
third day unWanted guest,
l expected such a treatment.

454
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,882
Did you've such bad idea about us?

455
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:05,680
You too have little.

456
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:10,693
l expected you'll shoW differences between
relatives of husband side & Wife side.

457
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,159
But Vasundhara looks
after everyone equally.

458
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,127
Were you having such
cheap idea about us?

459
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,461
Don't Worry, just playing With you.

460
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:19,761
Look!
- ls it?

461
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:23,197
Yenki's marriage cost dear to Subbi.
This is it.

462
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:29,039
ln the name of your marriage,
your aunt made me shell out Rs.25000.

463
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,572
You'll anything Whatever
your tongue Wags.

464
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:35,809
Table full of tasteless food and
love less husband are of no use.

465
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,715
l married him because he's aunt's son.

466
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,147
What We eat daily is any special,
is aunt's son a husband?

467
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,224
Like old husband even on festival day.

468
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,953
Hear this one.

469
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,222
Long back a maiden,

470
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:54,963
l thought 'Garbhadanam' means
eating something not this torture.

471
00:37:56,407 --> 00:38:00,002
Another man When he Was called
to bedroom for the first night,

472
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:05,672
said, he has got no time and use
someone else as standby and finish it.

473
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:07,980
Out sourcing?

474
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:11,712
There Was his brother, he Was
asked to say something good.

475
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,824
He asked, Where's the bride WidoW?

476
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,518
When asked by sister-in-laW to
come to romance her.

477
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,720
Brother-in-laW asked,
What benefit Would l get?

478
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,058
l never said like that.
- Why Would you say like that?

479
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,928
You'll say it's not proper to
romance aunt daughter.

480
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,160
Stubborn husband Will cry if l pinch also.

481
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:28,360
Don't use the occasion to pinch me.

482
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,267
l knoW only this proverb,
please don't mind.

483
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,170
This is What you call pinching the
child and then rocking the cradle.

484
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,376
Did you say about my Wife
or a proverb?

485
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:39,015
Proverbs come from our lives only.

486
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,074
lf you see Arundhati star in marriage,
you'll not get such doubts.

487
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,186
Where did he see Arundhati?

488
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,979
When asked have you seen Arundhati?

489
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:51,025
lt seems he said l didn't see
but saW Rs.60000 loan.

490
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:59,030
l Was lucky in this matter, uncle.
l could see only Rs.25000.

491
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,466
Even that Rs.25000 Was my dad's.

492
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:10,511
Marriage homes must be happy
and filled With laughter.

493
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:14,742
Will gossip fill our stomachs?
Let's hit the dinner table.

494
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:15,884
Everything is ready.

495
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,479
Why haven't mom and dad
returned from the bride's place?

496
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,554
They Will come.
- Children, come.

497
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,653
Hey groom! Just got a call that
your visa is ready.

498
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,853
Tie the knot and leave to America.

Go ahead, l'm not that
handsome anyway.

507

We told her that you'll marry
Without seeing her photo also.

bride and groom agreeing to marry
Without seeing each other,

My son is cool,
Why are you so itching to see her?

521
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,228
Along With him all of you must
see her in marriage only.

522
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,028
That's Will add great thrill
to the marriage.

As youth gets displeasured,
heart gets illuminated...

539
00:42:55,339 --> 00:43:01,209
Groom's people, very kind people
arriving for the marriage...

She's not here.

We traced the lnnova With

628
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:30,781
it's a fake number.

629

We've shoWn state Wide

He said he isn't in that list.

631
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:38,226
They have abducted her
before marriage,

632
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:41,759
they could be your enemies too.
- My enemies?

633

Bride's parents, he's Commissioner.
- Greetings.

Who Was after your daughter?

Sorry, l didn't mean like that.

636

l thought it Was better to
investigate from all angles.

637
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:03,547
Nothing like that, not because
she's my daughter, Deepthi is an angel.

638
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,447
Her only concentration Was on studies.

639
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:08,150
lf it Was for ransom, We Would've
got a phone call by noW.

640
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:10,120
We didn't get it, it means
it's more dangerous.

But this doesn't look like a
regular criminal's handiWork.

642
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,960
Somebody has planned it Well
to look like an accident.

643
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:16,358
Luckily no life Was lost.

644
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,467
You must solve this problem,
Sandeep must go to America next Week.

645
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:21,636
Come.

646
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:29,809

The sacrificial fire must burn
for entire 16 days non-stop.

648
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:38,316
Marriage is stopped, do We need to
keep the sacrificial fire burning?

649
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:42,423
Don't say it, it's Wrong, already
a bad thing has happened,

650
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:47,590
if sacrificial fire is put off midWay,
it's bad omen.

01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:48,491
Don't say like that.

652

face many obstacles,

We've studied psychos
and criminals list,

665
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,416
someone is very strong
against this marriage,

666
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:46,220
unable to trace out Where he has
taken her and What he may've done?

667
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,717
We suspect if she's alive.

Creadits Goes to IsaiThai.com [IsaiMannan]

669
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:05,032
Sandeep is going to America tomorroW,
We came to meet him.

670
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:07,503
We'll inform you immediately
on getting any clue.

671
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:13,410
Calm doWn...please calm doWn.

672
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:16,542
Be brave.

673
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:21,721
Police have given up,
it's better We too give up.

674
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,919
Please don't mistake me
for saying this,

675
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:26,424
Deepthi is also like my granddaughter,

676
01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:29,256
if she goes missing,
What can anyone do?

677
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:37,434
Why not get that quick marriage broker and
get Sandeep married before he leaves?

678
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,164
You said What l thought.

679
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,070
lt's marriage only after
one ties the knot.

680
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:45,077
Even it one tied the knot, legally they must
Walk the holy seven steps together.

681
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:48,250
lt isn't a marriage and
the missing girl isn't your Wife.

682
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:50,817
First let him go to America
and get out of it.

683
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:56,419
Our bad luck mustn't affect
your son's life.

684
01:04:57,526 --> 01:05:02,463
HoW long can you Wait for my daughter
nobody knoWs if she's alive or not?

685
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:03,131
Hubby!

686
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:08,003
We did arrange a grand marriage,
but got stopped before tying the knot.

687
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:10,432
lt means they Weren't married.

688
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:19,045
We don't have any objection if you
fix another marriage for your son.- Okay.

689
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,009
What the hell are you saying?

690
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:24,309
ls it marriage only if l tie the knot?

691
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,845
Are the rituals before it nothing?

692
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:30,751
You gave her in marriage to me,
l accepted, has it got no meaning?

693
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,288
You made us place jaggery and
cumin seeds on head.

694
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:34,621
Was it a dolls play?

695
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:39,692
Nobody knoWs the meaning of Deepthi's
look on removing the screen,

696
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:43,298
is it you my friend for Whom
l Was Waiting till noW,

697
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:46,198
a happiness, a surprize,

698
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:49,804
she conveyed through her eyes,
l'll surrender my life to you.

699
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:54,149
Till noW magic of love
never touched me.

700
01:05:54,717 --> 01:06:00,383
That magic of love feeling...
l felt on Deepthi at the first sight.

701
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,085
Sister, you said you got the
same feeling in library.

702
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:07,755
You voWed to leave With him
going against parents.

703
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:11,127
l never understood the
poWer of first look.

704
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:15,570
Uday, you said about love at first sight,
When We ragged SWetha.

705
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,433
l used to think hoW could one
fall in love at first sight.

706
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,742
But l can understand noW,

707
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:26,039
that magic one moment Which can bring
two hearts together for lifetime,

708
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:29,482
you had it in library,
for you While ragging,

709
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:33,114
for me under the marriage canopy,

710
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:37,490
l fell in love With Deepthi
at first sight.

711
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:45,790
Whether tradition or laW accepts
or not, Deepthi is Wife.

712
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:48,128
Whether l tie knot With her or not...

713
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:55,939
Hearing their Words l'm scared
if sister is alive or not.

714
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:59,915
But hearing your Words
l feel she's alive.

715
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:05,779
Like in fables you read, l'll bring your
sister even if she's beyond seven seas.

716
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:07,455
Well said grandson!

717
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:12,388
When you chose traditional marriage,
l thought you Were doing it for fun,

718
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:19,099
love sprouted from that tradition, and
you're so responsible for that love,

719
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,290
l came to knoWjust noW.

720
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:24,602
What you said a little While ago is true,

721
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:29,307
placing jaggery and
cumin seeds isn't child's play,

722
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:30,638
it isn't fun too,

723
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:38,116
When you mix jaggery and
cumin seeds, it's energy,

724
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:41,079
a magnetic force is produced
from that energy,

725
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:44,122
it produces magnetic force!

726
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:48,158
LikeWise an attraction develops
between Wife and husband.

727
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:50,491
What our science says?

728
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:52,524
The divine spiritual energy
enters from here,

729
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:54,258
it's alWays closed,

730
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:58,663
When jaggery and cumin seeds
are placed here, it opens up,

731
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:05,045
spiritual energy above Will reach
the centre of forehead here,

732
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:13,388
When they see each other,
each other's energy Will merge into one,

733
01:08:13,956 --> 01:08:18,655
that's first sight,
that's What We call magic of love!

734
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,895
lt's love Which unites two hearts forever.

735
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:27,260
You Will come victorious!

736
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:30,163
You Will come back With your Wife.

737
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:33,540
The voWs you made,
they Will protect you.

738
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:20,598
Forget her!

739
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:24,676
Forget her!

740
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:38,287
Till noW didn't find any trace
about the girl?

741
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:41,458
What is your department doing?
ls it Working or sleeping?

742
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,760
What are you trying?
To find Ways to close this case.

743
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:49,630
You may say some psycho killed her
and didn't find body also.

744
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:51,806
That's all, okay?
l knoW your Working style.

745
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:56,137
Governments change
but police are the same alWays.

746
01:11:57,379 --> 01:12:00,815
Going over speed, sloW doWn.

747
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:04,811
When my daughter Went missing,
Sandeep informed her Whereabouts.

748
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:05,679
Not the police.

749
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:11,322
His future Wife is missing
and l'm unable to help him.

750
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,227
l must help him, mustn't l?

751
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:16,394
Where is Sandeep?

752
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:20,500
lt's been 3 days since he
has come home.

753
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:24,297
He gave up job in America for Deepthi.

754
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:28,837
Poor boy! He mustn't get into trouble
going in search of her.

755
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:32,602
Nothing Will happen to him,
he saW her forjust a moment only,

756
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:35,306
but has fallen in love so deeply,

757
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:38,748
Sandeep Will come back
With Deepthi only.

Why are you here on roads instead

On Which day it got stopped?

762
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:37,345
Noodles mustn't boil for more
than two minutes,

763
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:40,014
three knots of marriage mustn't
take more than 3 minutes.

764
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:45,676
lf you go on road, if it's traffic jam,
ogle the girl in next car,

765
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:47,082
marry her in the parking lot,

766
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:50,018

01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:20,917
l think he's planning
to bump you off.

777
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,886
Why a plan to kill me?
Just a punch can do it.

778

Your level is very loW,
so arranging separately.

They must come out atleast to kill me.

That's enough to knoW the
Whereabouts of Deepthi.

She forced us to send our daughter

Sister is very good lady,
she presented this rose plant to me.

For attending school regularly.

Look...look here!

828
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:07,489
Got scared? Tell me!
Remove your hands.

829
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,461
Please don't harm me.
- Remove hands...got scared?

830
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,699
Will you throW acid on her?
You go! l'll take care of him.

831
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:19,572
HoW dare you tease girls?
Are girls so cheap to you?

832
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:20,638
Will you throW acid on her?

833
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:23,777
lnfact those girls must
throW acid on rogues like you.

834
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:25,378
Even encounter death to
rogues like you is justified.

835
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:26,877
Are you neW to this area?
HoW dare you attack me!

836
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:11,859
Move!

837
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:35,072
Creadits Goes to IsaiThai.com [IsaiMannan]

838
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,352
Sir, the girl Who Was here just noW...
- AnganWadi teacher?

839
01:22:48,763 --> 01:22:49,730
Went home just noW.

840
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:51,558
AnganWadi teacher?

841
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,562
Where is her home?
- Near that temple.

842
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:03,335
Madam, AnganWadi teacher's house...?
- This one only.

843
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:07,281
Don't knoW What had happened,
just noW police came and took her.

844
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:14,984
Daddy, call the Commissioner
immediately....

845
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,391
Sandy is here!
- HoW are you my brother?

846
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:25,163
HoW are you my son?
- Got any information?

847
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:29,995
Your information is correct,
l think teacher knoWs about Deepthi.

848
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:34,507
You traced her out before us.

849
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:38,771
We tried to get information before
you but she's tight lipped.

850
01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:42,740
l'm sure she has some information.
Actually We should...

851
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:04,028
l'm an Ogre, devotee of Satan.

852
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:09,436
Will you deny eternity to me
for not having heavenly ambrosia?

853
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:13,707
Even Gods Who had ambrosia
Will meet end in the great storm.

854
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:21,783
But Lord Shiva Who has taken
the poison Will defy death.

855
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,017
Enemy of the death!

856
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:27,824
Lord Shiva is eternal!

857
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:28,996
Evil poWer!

858
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:34,761
lf a man With poison in neck
can become eternal,

859
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:36,867
Why shouldn't l be?

860
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:40,432
Every cell in me is filled With poison.

861
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:42,776
lsn't that qualification enough for me?

862
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:46,008
Goddess Abhisarani!

863
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:47,844
Goddess Sharvani!

864
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:50,107
Goddess of Mantra and Tantra!

865
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:56,019
Devil, she-devil, ghost, demon,
elf, fiend, monster, Ogre, Satan!

866
01:24:56,558 --> 01:24:58,025
Evil poWers!

867
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:02,055
Announce to the World, l'm eternal!

868
01:25:02,897 --> 01:25:04,421
Evil poWer!

869
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:06,332
l don't have death!

870
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:09,464
l don't have death!

871
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:12,569
l don't have death!

872
01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:25,881
They stopped the bus for this play,
you got me into this.

873
01:25:27,422 --> 01:25:28,218
HoW much more time Will it last?

874
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:30,115
Already We are very late.

875
01:25:30,592 --> 01:25:32,560
l think bus Will not start
even after the play is over.

876
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,091
People are mesmerized.

877
01:25:34,429 --> 01:25:35,896
People at home Will
be tensed if l'm late.

878
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:57,581
MLA Kondaraju Will honour
DiWakar on the stage.

879
01:25:57,785 --> 01:25:58,410
He Will honour!

880
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:09,092
You mustn't do the honour,
it must be done by that girl!

881
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:19,070
Let's go and sit in the bus, coming?

882
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:25,612
Anybody can act but only DiWakar can
put life into those characters.

883
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:28,782
He's overdoing everything.
Who is he?

884
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:32,851
He behaves like a psycho and
none to beat him negative characters.

885
01:26:33,054 --> 01:26:34,851
Yes, indeed he's going
overboard in everything.

886
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:28,031
He Wanted to get honoured by you,
hoW dare you refuse!

887
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,039
You've committed a mistake.

888
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:33,544
Where ever he plays a drama,
you must attend and honour him.

889
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:35,375
FolloW him.
- lsn't it, brother?- Come here.

890
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:41,220
Wrong, don't talk like that.
Deal Women smoothly.

891
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:45,284
She didn't like my acting,
so she didn't honour me.

892
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:47,454
Tell me...Why didn't you like it?

893
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:50,021
Tell me, Who l am?

894
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:54,432
True! l myself don't knoW Who am l...

895
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:57,128
Some say l'm a Mayala Maratee,

896
01:27:57,472 --> 01:27:59,201
some say l'm Sangram Singh,

897
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:02,737
Duryodhana, Betala, Keechaka,
they call me by many names,

898
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,303
till noW l Was slave to those roles,

899
01:28:05,647 --> 01:28:09,083
noW...just a While ago,
l came to knoW Who l am.

900
01:28:09,684 --> 01:28:11,083
That too because of you.

901
01:28:13,354 --> 01:28:15,914
Man...l'm a man!

902
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:19,484
l'm totally fallen for you.

903
01:28:20,528 --> 01:28:21,961
Engine has heated up.

904
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:24,989
l Want to drive holding the steering.

905
01:28:26,567 --> 01:28:28,296
What a figure! What a pride!

906
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:30,530
You didn't like my acting.

907
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:35,334
But as a man l'll satisfy your urges.

908
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:39,271
Tonight let's satisfy our urges.

909
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:42,281
Nothing Will happen if you
don't go to home for a night.

910
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:48,117
Don't do it for free.
Take anything you Want.

911
01:28:48,723 --> 01:28:50,748
Just one night!

912
01:29:03,905 --> 01:29:06,169
Evil poWer!

913
01:29:08,309 --> 01:29:12,040
l Won over death, l thought there's
nothing to Win over in this World.

914
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:15,447
There is evil poWer...there is...

915
01:29:17,285 --> 01:29:17,979
Woman!

916
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,715
l must Win over her!

917
01:29:21,756 --> 01:29:23,951
l Wanted her forjust one night only.

918
01:29:24,592 --> 01:29:26,992
No, that's not enough noW.

919
01:29:28,663 --> 01:29:31,928
This evil Ogre desires a Woman
and has fallen in love.

920
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:41,074
As many nights she has in her life,
l Want every one of it for myself.

921
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:50,074
My strength and her pride
are perfect match, evil poWer!

922
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:54,778
Love at first sight is routine,
love at first slipper shot is variety.

923
01:29:54,989 --> 01:29:56,923
lt's not love but birth
of a neW character.

924
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:59,250
Though he has come out of the stage,
Kapalika is still hanging on to him.

925
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:00,893
Don't knoW What Will he do noW.

926
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:06,194
What? ls it sultry?

927
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:09,498
From noW onWards only AC buses
must ply on this route.

928
01:30:10,705 --> 01:30:14,835
Don't do it for one night,
We have many nights in future,

929
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:18,038
go, drop them.

930
01:30:25,153 --> 01:30:27,417
We thought he'll get sense
if hit With a slipper,

931
01:30:28,189 --> 01:30:30,953
We never expected
he'll go to this length.

932
01:30:37,999 --> 01:30:41,696
Till noW We didn't kneW him,
noW that We knoW let's get him, sir.

933
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:54,842
We couldn't do anything till noW
because We didn't kneW about Deepthi,

934
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:57,708
noW We knoW she's in DiWakar's custody,
Why don't you make a move?

935
01:30:59,687 --> 01:31:03,350
We didn't kneW anything about her,
so We had some hope,

936
01:31:04,358 --> 01:31:05,256
after knoWing...

937
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:08,859
...it's better to forget about her.

938
01:31:12,366 --> 01:31:16,268
Nobody can ever touch DiWakar.
He's no ordinary man.

939
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,939
l don't care Who he is!
All l care is What he has done.

940
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,732
Kidnapping Deepthi is enough
to shoW him hell.

941
01:31:25,847 --> 01:31:29,180
KK brothers mean kings of hell!

942
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:32,615
Prabhakar and DiWakar!
ShoW them hell is impossible.

943
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:40,291
Worst example of children groWing
into demons from a broken family.

944
01:31:41,462 --> 01:31:44,761
Prabhakar and DiWakar are
illegal children of their father.

945
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:55,566
Creadits Goes to IsaiThai.com [IsaiMannan]

946
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:03,683
Both ruling party and
opposition party are their slaves.

947
01:32:04,285 --> 01:32:06,583
Prabhakar is happy if people
are afraid of him.

948
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:12,548
But DiWakar has a strange Weakness.

949
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:14,850
Playing drama!

950
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:21,767
Even in real life he behaves like
the villain roles he dons in dramas.

951
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:30,507
Does your old hands still
have the same strength?

952
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:34,305
Was it these hands that signed
to cancel our bus permits?

953
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:38,714
l'll noW cut your hands into pieces.

954
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:46,126
Give your hands to me, Thakur!

955
01:32:53,434 --> 01:32:58,633
He's a human beast Who can tame
a raging bull With empty hands.

956
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:15,646
Creadits Goes to IsaiThai.com [IsaiMannan]

957
01:33:25,499 --> 01:33:27,626
Evil poWer!

958
01:33:29,403 --> 01:33:31,337
He doesn't care about laW or death.

959
01:33:31,973 --> 01:33:34,464
To say clearly,
he has no control on himself.

960
01:33:35,109 --> 01:33:36,599
He behaves abnormally.

961
01:33:37,945 --> 01:33:45,477
Though We knoW Deepthi is With him,
it's not easy to free her from him.

962
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:47,487
Who is paying you salary?
Govt. or DiWakar?

963
01:33:47,688 --> 01:33:48,484
You're licking his boots!

964
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:52,355
ShoW your police poWer on
criminals not on innocents.

965
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,926
You may have your reasons,
but it's my Deepthi Who is With him,

966
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:57,063
l'll not care even if
God of Death himself comes.

967
01:33:57,431 --> 01:33:58,830
Why am l telling you this?

968
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:02,727
lnstead of doing a police job
Why not you better do...

969
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:07,202
l knoW hoW to bring back my Deepthi.

970
01:34:10,444 --> 01:34:11,672
Don't become a criminal
in the rush of blood.

971
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,115
You may get back her
if you kill him.

972
01:34:15,783 --> 01:34:17,751
You may have to spend
your life in jail.

973
01:34:18,452 --> 01:34:19,749
Please don't spoil your future.

974
01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:24,419
lf We fail to take action,
call us Whatever you Want.

975
01:34:24,725 --> 01:34:27,592
Just give us one chance
to do our duty.

976
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,067
Home Minister! HoW dare!

977
01:34:34,769 --> 01:34:37,863
l made you the Home Minister,
Will you let police come after me?

978
01:34:38,072 --> 01:34:41,132
Hold on forjust a minute, Prabhakar.
Don't raise your BP.

979
01:34:41,842 --> 01:34:43,207
SomeWhere a mistake has happened,

980
01:34:43,744 --> 01:34:45,211
hoW can police dare come to your home?

981
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:48,007
Are they here Without your permission?

982
01:34:48,282 --> 01:34:49,647
Don't narrate tales to me.

983
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:52,717
ln next elections my people
Will not vote for you,

984
01:34:52,987 --> 01:34:54,511
they Will run buses over you.

985
01:34:54,722 --> 01:34:57,054
Give the phone to the officer,
l'll talk to him.

986
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:01,426
Who are you?

987
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:04,154
You? What's this rashness?

988
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:07,991
Do you think yourself
a police hero in uniform?

989
01:35:08,269 --> 01:35:09,201
Sir, that is...

990
01:35:10,438 --> 01:35:14,772
You must feel...
that's the poWer of the uniform.

991
01:35:16,644 --> 01:35:19,408
You're the first officer to there
With a Warrant.

992
01:35:19,814 --> 01:35:24,012
Don't discuss like politician,
bash those two bastards like policeman.

993
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:27,919
You do your duty, l'll not stop
officers discharging their duty.

994
01:35:28,656 --> 01:35:33,423
Don't shoW happiness on face,
keep it sullen as if l'm scolding you.

995
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:35,884
Give the phone to that bastard!

996
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:39,662
Did you tell him?
- l told him clearly.

997
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:43,696
Just a formality, they'll see
around your home and leave.

998
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:46,762
l'll take care of the later problems.
- Okay...okay.

999
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:03,787
lt's locked! Open it.

1000
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:07,826
l can open it but you can't bear it.

1001
01:36:08,562 --> 01:36:10,427
You'll get scared seeing
her pitiable condition.

1002
01:36:10,898 --> 01:36:12,456
Go...go and do your duty.

1003
01:36:12,666 --> 01:36:13,564
Open the door.

1004
01:36:14,635 --> 01:36:16,694
l'll not open it.
Do What so ever you Want to!

1005
01:36:16,904 --> 01:36:20,863
Once l confirm Who is inside,
l'll do What ever l can then.

1006
01:36:24,478 --> 01:36:27,413
ls it the Way to talk to an artiste
because you've poWer?

1007
01:36:28,716 --> 01:36:33,119
l'm telling you,
my girl is inside.

1008
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:35,779
She's safe.
Write a report and leave.

1009
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:37,352
Will you open it or
shall l break it open?

1010
01:36:37,558 --> 01:36:39,423
Will you break it?- Yes.
Let me see it.

1011
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:04,345
Take their cell phones and
break the Wireless sets.

1012
01:37:06,187 --> 01:37:08,417
Bloody, take it doWn! Go!

1013
01:37:08,689 --> 01:37:13,023
Study the sections and
book the cases. Go! - We'll go.

1014
01:37:14,395 --> 01:37:17,023
We'll come back for you!
You're finished!

1015
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:42,946
l've removed the chassis number
and replaced it With fake.

1016
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:07,405
Where?

1017
01:38:15,956 --> 01:38:16,581
HoW?

1018
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:47,482
What happened sir?

1019
01:38:47,888 --> 01:38:51,051
ACP's jeep has met With an accident
While coming from KK brothers' home.

1020
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:56,523
ACP and all others With him are dead.

1021
01:39:45,379 --> 01:39:48,212
lf you covet another man's Wife,
you'll get ruined.

1022
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:49,911
You'll pay dearly for your sins.

1023
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:57,482
Experience! What a lovely experience!

1024
01:40:01,395 --> 01:40:05,957
You're avoiding me Without
knoWing the bliss in my arms.

1025
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:07,967
Why are you so proud?

1026
01:40:09,203 --> 01:40:11,933
You're just a slave in the harem.

1027
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:17,136
The only qualification you've
is l desire you,

1028
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:20,140
if not What great qualification you have?

1029
01:40:21,215 --> 01:40:23,183
may your husband be God,

1030
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:24,710
may your husbands be angels,
holymen or Nagas or anything else,

1031
01:40:24,918 --> 01:40:26,510
may they be ogres, demons or devils,

1032
01:40:27,087 --> 01:40:32,889
but l'm mightiest of the
mightiest Keechaka.

1033
01:40:37,998 --> 01:40:41,263
Don't knoW hoW much that demon
is torturing my daughter.

1034
01:40:42,603 --> 01:40:47,472
He Would've molested her,
she Would've lost her chastity.

1035
01:41:08,328 --> 01:41:09,556
Nothing Will happen to Deepthi.

1036
01:41:15,869 --> 01:41:18,497
Chastity isn't a matter concerning body.

1037
01:41:20,407 --> 01:41:21,806
lt's about the mind.

1038
01:41:23,243 --> 01:41:27,043
lf her body is hurt, a doctor can
treat her back to health.

1039
01:41:28,649 --> 01:41:31,914
Her pure mind Will be
Waiting for me only.

1040
01:41:39,526 --> 01:41:40,925
No need for the Wife to commit adultery.

1041
01:41:41,962 --> 01:41:43,725
People desert Wives
purely on suspicion,

1042
01:41:44,665 --> 01:41:48,999
though a father
l'm not so broadminded,

1043
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:52,530
your grandfather Was right,

1044
01:41:53,607 --> 01:41:58,840
a man's true character comes out
only during difficulties.

1045
01:42:03,984 --> 01:42:07,317
l knoW if you study Well you
can earn degrees,

1046
01:42:09,089 --> 01:42:20,899
l just came to knoW you become
broadminded With culture.

1047
01:42:27,307 --> 01:42:32,210
One step further, l'll kill you,
or else l'll kill myself.

1048
01:42:33,614 --> 01:42:37,448
You'll never get me.
- No...no...you must be safe.

1049
01:42:37,951 --> 01:42:39,976
Losing your life or mine is same.

1050
01:42:41,221 --> 01:42:44,850
Okay, if you're not in mood noW,
tomorroW...

1051
01:42:45,626 --> 01:42:47,150
lf not tomorroW, day after tomorroW...

1052
01:42:47,728 --> 01:42:49,286
Can't l Wait for you?

1053
01:42:49,963 --> 01:42:53,558
lf it Was for a night only,
l Would've had you by force.

1054
01:42:53,867 --> 01:42:58,827
l Want all your nights for me,
that's Why l'm tolerating your abuses.

1055
01:43:01,842 --> 01:43:02,501
Take rest!

1056
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:14,712
l'll bring Deepthi.

1057
01:43:15,789 --> 01:43:17,757
l'm not saying just as responsibility,

1058
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:20,493
l'm saying it With love.

1059
01:43:24,798 --> 01:43:30,202
Not With laWs or sections,
one hit Will bring doWn his evil empire.

1060
01:43:31,138 --> 01:43:36,201
My rage Will not only make him
cry save me, even his evil poWer Will.

ShoW him our poWer, boys!

1065

lt's a Week, you don't eat or drink,
or even sleep.

1066
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:45,604
Though lost Weight,
you're still beautiful.

1067
01:45:46,039 --> 01:45:49,736
l Was expecting you'll give
yourself to me.

1068
01:45:50,177 --> 01:45:54,011
lf not l alWays have the right to force.

1069
01:45:57,050 --> 01:46:00,781
Still having hope that he'll come?

1070
01:46:01,421 --> 01:46:03,787
Brother, phone...
- No phone calls, get out.

1071
01:46:04,725 --> 01:46:07,489
Prabhakar brother has used
the Word urgent for the first time in life.

1072
01:46:14,067 --> 01:46:17,036
Tell me, What's it?
- Brother, a man here...

1073
01:46:17,938 --> 01:46:20,907
Not a man, say correctly.

1074
01:46:21,675 --> 01:46:24,769
Groom...Deepthi's groom.

1075
01:46:26,179 --> 01:46:27,146

You're nearing your death!

1078
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:20,759
Leave her!

1079
01:47:21,468 --> 01:47:22,435
Leave Deepthi!

1080
01:47:23,503 --> 01:47:25,596
lf not your brother Will die!

1081
01:47:28,909 --> 01:47:32,072
Yes, death has come very near.

1082
01:47:39,486 --> 01:47:39,952
Go!

1083
01:47:43,657 --> 01:47:44,146
Go!

1084
01:48:04,444 --> 01:48:08,039
Brother, don't leave her, kill him!

1085
01:48:36,309 --> 01:48:38,573
Brother, she made me remember
that l'm a man.

1086
01:48:38,879 --> 01:48:40,870
Though you brought her for yourself,

1087
01:48:41,581 --> 01:48:43,572
you have her first, then l'll have her.

1088
01:48:43,783 --> 01:48:49,915
Like We are partners in business,
let's share her too. Done?

1089
01:49:01,768 --> 01:49:05,932
Though Draupadi Was Won by Arjuna,
all 5 brothers shared her.

1090
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:08,730
Though l played so many dramas
based on Mahabharata,

1091
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:10,839
l forgot the basic concept of it.

1092
01:49:11,044 --> 01:49:13,706
Even Vali and Sugreeva
did same in Ramayana.

1093
01:49:13,914 --> 01:49:15,541
You're dead, bloody!

1094
01:49:16,116 --> 01:49:19,517
HoW dare he teaches me epics about
Vali and Sugreeva sharing a Wife.

1095
01:49:20,587 --> 01:49:23,147
Doesn't he knoW Sugreeva
planned and killed Vali?

1096
01:49:23,623 --> 01:49:26,558
Had you that common sense
you'd be alive noW, brother?

1097
01:49:27,794 --> 01:49:30,194
Will you leave your brother
as orphan, brother?

1098
01:49:31,064 --> 01:49:34,056
Our father died in your hands,
you died in my hands,

1099
01:49:34,701 --> 01:49:37,329
Why should l live noW?
Why should l live?

1100
01:49:41,908 --> 01:49:43,466
l must live for her.

1101
01:49:44,844 --> 01:49:50,441
lf anyone else desires What l like,
l'll not spare even if it's my oWn brother,

1102
01:49:51,151 --> 01:49:52,846
l'll kill him.

1103
01:49:55,989 --> 01:49:59,152
Till noW you got saved hiding
behind a Woman like a eunuch,

1104

Poor man! HoW long can he sWim?

1107
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:48,907
This is my domain!

1108
01:50:49,275 --> 01:50:51,869
lt isn't a thrill to kill a lion in kitchen,

1109
01:50:52,245 --> 01:50:56,375
but killing a deer in forest
is very thrilling.

1110
01:50:57,150 --> 01:50:59,209
l like hunting before killing.

1111
01:50:59,452 --> 01:51:01,215
Start!
- Already started!

1112
01:51:02,422 --> 01:51:03,684
Your brother's body...

Let's finish him first and
then cremate him leisurely.

1114

lf my desire has to be fulfilled,
l must offer a human sacrifice.

You didn't even tie the knot,
What am l to you?

l don't knoW.

1118
01:52:15,095 --> 01:52:17,586
But l feel like giving my life for you.

1119
01:53:25,231 --> 01:53:29,065
You didn't go aWay,
you came back for me.

1120
01:53:30,637 --> 01:53:31,899
That's enough for me.

Looks like she has been
starving for many days.

1124
01:54:37,804 --> 01:54:39,431
These tablets...
- Find her!

1125
01:54:39,639 --> 01:54:44,440

all of us under his lorry.

01:54:48,715 --> 01:54:51,513
l beg you, if they see me,
they Will kill me.

1129
01:54:51,718 --> 01:54:52,980
Please leave the place With her.
