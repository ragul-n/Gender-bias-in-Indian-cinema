1
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:36,773
- Is Arunmozhi varman there?
- Whose asking?

2
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:37,939
I came for medication

3
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:40,621
Just go down the lane and you will
find him couple of houses away

4
00:01:40,663 --> 00:01:43,424
Three weeks back, I met
him in this house only

5
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:46,971
This is fourth week, hence he will
be there in fourth house only

6
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,797
Hmm

7
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:54,860
If there is lack of concentration in work,
then that person will definitely fail

8
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:57,471
You want to know my achievements?

9
00:01:57,705 --> 00:02:01,195
I am 80 years old and my
profession is 50 years old

10
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:06,637
Even now I get clients despite
all the advanced Doctors

11
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:08,171
That’s my achievement.

12
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:09,983
You got healing hands

13
00:02:10,257 --> 00:02:14,840
Even at this age, you start your
practice at 7 AM without fail

14
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:18,603
Everyday, I woke up at 4
AM, then one hour walking,

15
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,991
One hour yoga,

16
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,369
I will wash my clothes before shower.

17
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:28,569
What are you praying sincerely everyday?

18
00:02:28,594 --> 00:02:31,877
I should live without depending anyone,

19
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:36,312
I pray that I should leave the
moment I start depending others!

20
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:44,111
I have big family and
performed all my duties

21
00:02:44,216 --> 00:02:47,929
Two of my grand kid’s
marriage are pending,

22
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:52,486
Once I have seen their marriage,
then I'll call it enough here

23
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:53,546
Don't cry kid

24
00:02:53,947 --> 00:02:56,913
- Hey Sangili, how is your hand now?
- I'm fine,

25
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:58,720
This is my grandson,

26
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:02,658
He was walking near our field
and stepped on a beer bottle

27
00:03:02,731 --> 00:03:04,778
These drunk guys are reckless

28
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,254
Even I was injured couple of
times...

29
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:09,481
...don't worry, will treat the wound

30
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:11,845
I went to the other house and they said...

31
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:14,611
Fourth week, hence fourth house,
Isn't that you heard?

32
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:15,356
Yes!

33
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:19,442
You both should have
been surprised by that?

34
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:21,204
Yes! but how did you know?

35
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:22,490
One house only, but

36
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:27,152
In the race against time,
my wife died early

37
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:29,809
I got three sons and a Daughter

38
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:31,769
One week per house...

39
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:33,453
...and whatever I earn, will split with them...

40
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:37,101
...and stay with each of them for a week

41
00:03:40,726 --> 00:03:41,960
Then?

42
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:43,291
He's my first son.

43
00:03:43,687 --> 00:03:47,969
No one knows the poorness of the
rich and richness of the poor

44
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:51,300
Hmm! words from the Satan!

45
00:03:51,404 --> 00:03:53,755
He gets anger for everything.

46
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,888
He expects prime respect from everyone.

47
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:58,382
Whats the senile tiger asking?

48
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,694
He calls me Senile Tiger,
even the kids pick that word

49
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:05,455
Senile Tiger, mom calling you for lunch.

50
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:07,561
My grandson is more
close to me than my son

51
00:04:08,907 --> 00:04:14,865
Paramu is more poisonous than
snake's venom! be careful!!

52
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:20,301
My elder grandson Paramu neither
raises voice nor raises his hands

53
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:21,683
A Paper!

54
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,769
A Pen!

55
00:04:23,058 --> 00:04:24,433
Just one Petition!

56
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:29,993
That's all! Once he filed a petition
for making him wait in the ration shop

57
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:33,978
Once he filed a petition for the
bus coming late by ten minutes

58
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:36,865
Finally, he filed petition on the police...

59
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,552
...who delayed the enquiry of his previous petitions

60
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:42,415
Government, Is it functioning or frozen?

61
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,352
- What's your Problem Sir?
- Why didn't you shave?

62
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:46,508
Who the hell is this guy?

63
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:50,401
Is he married?

64
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:54,400
I told you that I have
a daughter,

65
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:57,389
- Brother, did you see 'that'?
- No

66
00:04:57,448 --> 00:04:59,871
That’s the way we used to
search the domestic animals

67
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:01,924
- Did 'it' came this way?
- No

68
00:05:02,348 --> 00:05:05,181
My daughter searches her
husband the same way

69
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:07,863
Let the peace prevails everywhere

70
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:11,443
Get up drunkard! Why are you
embarrassing me like this?

71
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:13,436
Aren't you ashamed?

72
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:17,836
Uncle, Without getting a groom for your
daughter, why are you doing all this?

73
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:25,133
Wait until I file a petition on you!

74
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:28,336
Thus finally, He married Umayal's daughter.

75
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:35,322
Lady, where's your husband?

76
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:36,233
I don't know

77
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,488
Don't you respect this uniform my lady?

78
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:40,556
Are you new here?

79
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,394
- Yes, why are you asking?
- We got used to this!

80
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:45,322
If he comes home, ask him
to come to Police station

81
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:47,483
If he comes to your station,
ask him to come home

82
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:49,441
This is my third son's house

83
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,764
He is Engineer in
Electricity board office

84
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:55,429
He switches off the bike while
descending the road, Such a thrift

85
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:57,859
Good earning in Government job,

86
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,675
He does money lending as well,

87
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:03,613
He likes to count and smell the currency

88
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,113
and a big snack eater!

89
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,604
Yeah, keep explaining our
family tree to all passerby

90
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:13,439
- Everyone please have food.

91
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:14,676
What about his kids?

92
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:16,070
His son is in Dubai

93
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:18,746
He left his wife here and earning there...

94
00:06:18,787 --> 00:06:20,732
...but calls himself a Family man!

95
00:06:20,764 --> 00:06:22,483
Hey Baby, Wazzup?

96
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,801
Your father sends me in the
bus to the hospital...

97
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:27,621
...despite having a car

98
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:31,985
He just smells the money but never spends,

99
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:34,704
It's too hot here and we need an AC!

100
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:38,217
Ok, but what about your second son?

101
00:06:38,242 --> 00:06:39,982
He's chandrabose

102
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:49,081
He's the smartest and strongest

103
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:52,894
He desires to be first everywhere,

104
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:59,806
Unnecessary death, leaving
his family to suffer

105
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,754
Oh god! Why do you keep blabbering?

106
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:09,378
Thenmozhi, Thenu(Honey) neither
expires nor exploits others

107
00:07:09,821 --> 00:07:14,149
Such a pure soul with high self respect

108
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:16,048
She has a son

109
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:26,665
Compassionate and soft natured

110
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:30,950
Smart enough to win everyone

111
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:37,124
- Who do you think will win?
- I vouch for Arumpon.

112
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:42,045
Come on, Come on guys, Cheers!

113
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:06,066
Guys, It's my treat so have
fun, but PAY for yourself

114
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:08,983
- Bro
- Bro, what a victory!

115
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:13,957
Bro, we are expected to win continuously

116
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,418
- We will win!
- Yes, definitely!

117
00:08:26,696 --> 00:08:28,294
Just one son?

118
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,622
He have a sister, Tulasi

119
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:35,410
If a garden is filled with all types
of plants void of Tulasi plant,

120
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:37,129
Then it's not called as garden

121
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:42,212
Also, even one Tulasi plant will
make an empty place into a garden

122
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:46,651
Likewise, this house is considered
a garden by my presence, got it?

123
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:48,615
- Got it!
- Yes!

124
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:51,498
Such an example for siblings.

125
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,710
Brother..

126
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,584
Will you do anything I ask for?

127
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:59,151
Do you doubt that bro?

128
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:02,089
Do I look like an idiot to
follow all your orders blindly?

129
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:05,062
- I will listen if it has any value, else,
- Enough sister!

130
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,746
Don't eat too much!

131
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:11,173
My daughter-in-law desires to get
Tulasi married to her nephew,

132
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,340
Either PK or CK, I'm fine with one
of them getting married to Tulasi

133
00:09:15,393 --> 00:09:17,833
Have you seen 'Pasamalar',
'Kilakku seemaiyile' films?

134
00:09:17,864 --> 00:09:18,692
Yes

135
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:19,988
This is the latest version

136
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,533
My sister is my soul
and she's my world

137
00:09:22,643 --> 00:09:24,252
I'm content if she's happy

138
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:27,846
I can't bear the pain if she cries!

139
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:30,971
When my eyes are open, I
wish to see her smile

140
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:34,799
When my eyes are shut, I
wish to hear her happiness

141
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,533
Welcome my dear brother

142
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:39,978
You are my rock star!

143
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:45,208
Your presence gives me abundance power

144
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:50,856
Oh my brother, His
kindness precedes his name

145
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:56,117
And there's no other
brother with such a fame

146
00:09:56,199 --> 00:10:01,350
Oh my brother, His
kindness precedes his name

147
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:05,825
And there's no other
brother with such a fame

148
00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:12,176
Oh my dear sister, you are our princess

149
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:17,106
Your kindness keeps me in my senses

150
00:10:17,393 --> 00:10:22,679
My sister, her kindness precedes her name

151
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:27,705
And there's no other
sister with such a fame

152
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:33,221
She's the ambassador for
all my love proposals

153
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:39,106
She's smart enough to make
me win at all junctures

154
00:10:39,184 --> 00:10:46,762
My brothers charm and smile,
is a delight to watch

155
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:51,799
Oh my brother, His
kindness precedes his name

156
00:10:52,143 --> 00:10:57,788
And there's no other
brother with such a fame

157
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,059
My sister is my soul

158
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:02,726
and she's my world

159
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,163
My sister is my soul

160
00:11:07,038 --> 00:11:08,038
and she's my world

161
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:13,332
My brother is more important than you

162
00:11:16,463 --> 00:11:19,483
My brothers are more
important than you!

163
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:34,666
I will be your brother even in your
next birth, lets sign an agreement

164
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:40,135
Next birth you will be my father and lets
continue this circle without annulment

165
00:11:40,244 --> 00:11:45,687
It's rare to find such
compassion with relatives

166
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:50,713
Take a look, We are the
Pasamalar Part 2 derivatives

167
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:56,052
I will buy this world
if my sister wishes for

168
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,345
Her smile alone is enough
for me to live for

169
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:06,536
I will not let go of you
even if God asks for

170
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:11,536
Oh my brother, His kindness
for sister precedes his name

171
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:17,291
And there's no other
brother with such a fame

172
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,316
My sister, her kindness precedes her name

173
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:28,255
And there's no other
sister with such a fame

174
00:12:29,203 --> 00:12:30,203
My sister is my soul

175
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:33,161
and she's my world

176
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:35,567
My sister is my soul

177
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:38,328
and she's my world

178
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:42,185
- Brother!
- Yes Sister?

179
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:48,128
Hello, dear ?

180
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:49,964
What happened?

181
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:55,488
The new Kerala mill owner is poaching
our labors with high salary

182
00:12:56,463 --> 00:12:57,986
All of them are leaving
after the pooja holidays

183
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,807
Ok, did you inform your nephew about this?

184
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:10,807
First talk to Ayyanar

185
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:16,886
- Nephew
- Yes Uncle?

186
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:18,239
Come and meet me

187
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:28,261
Who is it Uncle? The Keralite?

188
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:30,249
Uncle, shall I say one thing?

189
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:33,785
An owner should know things end to end

190
00:13:34,136 --> 00:13:36,621
or should get things done.

191
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,566
You have both, but that's not enough

192
00:13:40,323 --> 00:13:41,009
What do you mean?

193
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:44,281
Let me explain.

194
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:51,546
Guys, just hold on a minute,

195
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,703
This is not just one time occasion,
we will do this every month

196
00:13:58,057 --> 00:14:03,283
From Today, my uncle will take
care of you all, so have fun guys

197
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:06,651
- Marudhu, all good ? have fun
- Sure brother!

198
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,621
Where was this
hospitality till now?

199
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,877
The moment we plan to leave,
these guys are giving us respect

200
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:13,697
and we are acknowledging
this without qualm

201
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:15,174
Hey, check if he wants anything.

202
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:18,864
- Balaji, having good time?
- Yes bro, superb party

203
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:23,851
His parents were not talking to each other
for 15 years and he didn't mend anything...

204
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:26,490
...but now pretending to be our peacemaker

205
00:14:28,185 --> 00:14:30,651
Guys, have nice time

206
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:35,343
And don't drink and drive, sleep
here and leave in the morning

207
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:38,561
- Ayyanar, take care of them
- Sure Uncle

208
00:14:47,744 --> 00:14:48,744
Oh god!

209
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:51,888
Oh my good lord!

210
00:14:51,913 --> 00:14:56,570
All you drunken morons, which
one of you picked the lock?

211
00:14:56,756 --> 00:14:58,272
What the hell happened ?
Why are you shouting?

212
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:02,725
1 kg gold, Rs,20 Lakhs cash, one of
your men cracked the safe and stole it

213
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,796
- Stolen?
- Yes

214
00:15:03,978 --> 00:15:06,446
Is this the way you
guys show your honor?

215
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:10,642
Ayyanar, no one should leave from here,
shut the door and call the police

216
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:11,761
- Sir, but..
- Shut up

217
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:14,547
Wait uncle, have patience

218
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:17,214
There may be few black sheeps among them

219
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:20,792
But we can't make everyone
suffer at the hands of Police

220
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:24,605
All your wealth came from their hard work,

221
00:15:24,746 --> 00:15:27,762
so except the thieves no one
else should be humiliated

222
00:15:27,872 --> 00:15:31,098
Also do you think that the thief
will continue to work here?

223
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,448
A week or a year, the thieves will try
to leave the job and reveal themselves

224
00:15:36,012 --> 00:15:37,694
then we will show our wrath

225
00:15:37,882 --> 00:15:40,299
Ok guys, get ready and start the work

226
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,017
Why did you send everyone away?

227
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,586
Aunty, what was there in the safe?

228
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:49,031
Rs.20 Lakhs cash, 1 Kg gold
and 3 diamond necklace

229
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,156
- Is it?
- Yes!

230
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,767
Rs.12,500 in cash, two fake currency,
80-100 gm gold, Am I right?

231
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:58,834
What are you talking about?

232
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,813
My men only cracked the safe Aunty!

233
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:06,074
All the goods are kept inside
the pooja room, go and fetch it

234
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:09,798
Uncle, do you think anyone
will try to leave us?

235
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:15,813
Uncle, I will do anything
to protect your pride

236
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:24,731
Brother ! A snake bit
me, come here fast.

237
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,479
Oh my! please come fast

238
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:29,231
- Sister!
- What happened?

239
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:30,406
Come fast brother!

240
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:33,343
- Snake bit me!
- Did you take a look at the snake?

241
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:35,507
- I don't know brother
- Just check the type bro

242
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,518
Grandpa, A snake bit Tulasi

243
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:40,928
Bring her fast

244
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:43,855
Nothing will happen dear

245
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:46,277
Just chew this, fast

246
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:48,091
Uncle, A snake bit Tulasi

247
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:49,735
What? Tulasi bit a snake?

248
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:55,282
Is it a poisonous snake?

249
00:16:57,911 --> 00:17:00,489
Hospital will be costly,

250
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,788
What happened son?

251
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,702
Take her to the old man

252
00:17:07,116 --> 00:17:09,678
- Hey, which type is this?
- Cobra bro!

253
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:12,649
- Grandpa, it's painful
- Please bear it dear

254
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:17,676
You didn't check the snake?

255
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:19,500
No aunty, but brother
is searching for it

256
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:23,225
Grandpa, unable to confirm the snake
type, but we found cobra skin there

257
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,536
Oh no! Poisonous Cobra!

258
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,002
Cobra's bite will not look like this,

259
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:30,909
This looks like,

260
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:32,449
An harmless water snake

261
00:17:32,474 --> 00:17:35,419
What!!! You guys brought
the whole house down!

262
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,218
Not just water snake, even for moth,
they will behave like this only

263
00:17:38,293 --> 00:17:40,089
But, who called everyone?

264
00:17:40,115 --> 00:17:46,234
It's me bro, I sent a voice message in
family whats app group and everyone's here

265
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:47,493
Let's deal this later!

266
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,969
It's painful grandpa.

267
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:52,563
What? Court ordered to shut down wine shop?

268
00:17:52,677 --> 00:17:55,949
- Yes bro!
- What will our guys do now?

269
00:17:56,263 --> 00:17:59,059
No, oh no!

270
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:02,636
Acharya Devo Bava!

271
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:07,376
The thing is, he flooded the
government with petitions

272
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:12,227
Our defense is that we will open
the wine shop after 12 noon

273
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:17,324
Their counter defense is that, the liquor
is available since 6 AM through backdoor

274
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:22,506
Our defense is that, the bar
and wine shop is shut at 10 PM

275
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:27,089
Their counter defense is that, the liquors
available in black market after 10 PM

276
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:30,110
He also adds that, those
who buys in black market,

277
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:33,086
settles at schools late night and get drunk

278
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:35,204
on top of all this things,

279
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:41,089
The used cups are mixed with
drinking water and makes it nasty

280
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:42,866
Remember the Diwali offer banner?

281
00:18:42,932 --> 00:18:50,339
those who drinks above Rs. 1000 will be selected
randomly and offered with Fridge, TV or Grinder

282
00:18:50,391 --> 00:18:55,748
He filmed a documentary about this and
showed to Judge,

283
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:58,326
with caption
- A FILM BY ARUMPON

284
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:01,545
- What should we do Uncle?
- What were you doing till now?

285
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:06,473
Just chill Client, the judgment is not
to have wine shop in the city limits

286
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:10,537
I'm suggesting to shift bar and
wine shop outside the city limits

287
00:19:10,788 --> 00:19:15,028
All our customers will reach
the spot by any means, got it?

288
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:19,105
Thus, no case can stop our income!

289
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:25,552
I don't run this shop for money,

290
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:28,123
It's my pride to have a shop in the city

291
00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:31,226
- Pride? huh!
- My nephew was earning through that bar!

292
00:19:31,616 --> 00:19:37,574
Running a Bar, Cattle feeding and owning
a Marriage hall are all rich men's pride

293
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:38,629
 and they are trying to spoil that

294
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:41,787
He has already spoiled your reputation

295
00:19:42,118 --> 00:19:43,722
Arumpon and Petition Paramu!

296
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:50,528
Uncle, it's been five years
and the ritual is incomplete

297
00:19:50,654 --> 00:19:55,093
Shall we complete the ritual ? I feel that's
the reason for bad things happening to Tulasi

298
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:59,101
If you feel so, let's offer
prayer and complete rituals

299
00:19:59,325 --> 00:20:00,325
On top of it,

300
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:04,331
- We will come to know..
- Who all will attend!

301
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:10,703
Check with your uncles for their availability,
let's finish it before the horse function.

302
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:14,810
Let's not humiliate Tulasi in the
name of rituals, check with her once

303
00:20:14,953 --> 00:20:18,250
I'm in, at least I'll
be showered with gifts

304
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:23,933
Dear son, for a change, we
are going to have feast!

305
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,567
- Only feast?
- Off course

306
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:28,360
Based on our petition, Court
shuts down all the wine shops

307
00:20:30,343 --> 00:20:33,582
Sons! Why are you getting
into such unnecessary things?

308
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:36,499
Be careful guys, they
are petty minded people

309
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:39,577
- being righteous may..
- get us into trouble

310
00:20:45,762 --> 00:20:47,950
Brother, Fresh stock.

311
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,943
- How is the sales of our Tulasi brand?
- going well

312
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:53,628
- You want some more
- No, will take it next week

313
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:57,117
- Bro, I came to your house and uncle was not there
- That's good news, right?

314
00:20:57,143 --> 00:20:58,966
Bro, I want to talk about the ritual prayer

315
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,246
- Yes Uncle?
- What are you planning to do?

316
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:03,973
Uncle, they should know what fear is.

317
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:07,263
Hey, we all are related and
this will create more trouble

318
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,345
So don't complicate things,

319
00:21:09,397 --> 00:21:13,114
- but Uncle,
- First let's try to compromise through his Uncle

320
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:16,887
- was he angry? what you told him bro?
- Nothing serious bro.

321
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:19,419
Good one bro!

322
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:22,770
- Hey, do you have CPR brand sesame oil?
- No, we have only Tulasi brand sesame oil

323
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,157
- Don't mention about that cheap product!

324
00:21:24,294 --> 00:21:26,430
Better shut down your store!

325
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:31,199
The district collector has ordered,
so better shut down the store!

326
00:21:31,263 --> 00:21:33,825
Again! Good one bro!

327
00:21:34,505 --> 00:21:36,043
Why would you do the
rituals for her?

328
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,028
I will attend for your sake sister,

329
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,599
But won't be part of ceremony

330
00:21:40,637 --> 00:21:41,637
Why not brother?

331
00:21:42,005 --> 00:21:44,895
We are not responsible for
your husband's wrongdoing

332
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,887
and people will speak ill about us,

333
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:49,348
Aunty, Veg-stew is superb!

334
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:51,762
Brother's opinion is correct,

335
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,786
We would have participated if
it were your own daughter,

336
00:21:55,989 --> 00:21:57,278
Will you do it or not?

337
00:22:01,425 --> 00:22:02,993
- ok!
- fine!

338
00:22:03,018 --> 00:22:06,340
Why didn't you consult with me first?

339
00:22:06,372 --> 00:22:09,784
Your mother discussed with her brothers
first and then only came knocking my door

340
00:22:09,817 --> 00:22:12,433
You are mistaken uncle, I
came to your house first,

341
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:15,627
- You were not in home
- Is it so?

342
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:18,018
You are behaving exactly like your dad!

343
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:20,744
At least he's stepping up for
something, what about you?

344
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:25,205
But, Why should your uncle
participate in the ceremony?

345
00:22:25,236 --> 00:22:27,619
- They confirmed their participation
- Is it so?

346
00:22:29,174 --> 00:22:30,888
I will attend, but will not participate

347
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,693
- This is not fair
- Your husband always put money over relationship!

348
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,010
- Get lost!
- You too!

349
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:40,198
Your father's presence alone
will grace the ceremony!

350
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:41,877
His absence will be even more graceful!

351
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:45,549
- What?
- I'm at marriage hall, let's discuss about it.

352
00:22:46,956 --> 00:22:51,088
I would have thrashed him if
he was not related to us.

353
00:22:51,113 --> 00:22:55,487
Bro, just chill, take it slow.

354
00:22:55,613 --> 00:22:59,369
I registered that squatter land with your
help when you were the panchayat leader.

355
00:22:59,534 --> 00:23:01,932
That's the reason I'm having
this conversation with you.

356
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,557
Please warn your sons

357
00:23:03,745 --> 00:23:08,510
My son is innocent. It should be
his cousin. I will look into it.

358
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:13,487
I keep telling everyone that two
grooms are competing for my daughter,

359
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:15,838
in reality they are not
even ready to participate.

360
00:23:15,932 --> 00:23:19,018
They will participate and one
of them will marry Tulasi

361
00:23:19,116 --> 00:23:24,037
Don't worry, I won't leave them.
I will prove my worth.

362
00:23:24,121 --> 00:23:25,019
Mass bro!

363
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:29,212
However you try, you will fall
short of your Father's height!

364
00:23:29,237 --> 00:23:31,776
It has become a habit for people
to compare father and son.

365
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:35,994
Yes dad, that comparison is pretty stupid.

366
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,846
Bro, Just be cautious while going out

367
00:23:39,237 --> 00:23:42,049
- But I always take you with me
- Not anymore!

368
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:48,026
First we are going to elder uncle house
and then to the younger uncle house.

369
00:23:48,143 --> 00:23:51,112
- Bro!
- huh, the comic police!

370
00:23:51,198 --> 00:23:52,682
How are you bro?

371
00:23:52,713 --> 00:23:55,915
- I'm good, how is Video coverage...
- Business going on?

372
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:59,979
- It's alright uncle
- Sit, what's up?

373
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,548
What my father did maybe wrong,

374
00:24:02,878 --> 00:24:05,455
Please participate for
the sake of your sister

375
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:12,193
My mom will be happy if her brothers and
her nephews participate in the function

376
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:15,868
I had bought the gifts, all you have
to do is participate in the function

377
00:24:16,142 --> 00:24:20,262
and offer blessings for my sister

378
00:24:21,236 --> 00:24:26,314
- Guys, support me
- Dad, we owe aunt at least this much

379
00:24:26,511 --> 00:24:29,596
Also Tulasi deserves your blessing dad

380
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:35,306
Fine, I will present the
gift bought by you,

381
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,987
But your mom shouldn't think about
getting Tulasi married to one of my sons

382
00:24:41,143 --> 00:24:43,565
That's the deal, what do you say?

383
00:24:44,052 --> 00:24:47,092
I know that you wont accept Tulasi as your
daughter-in-law,

384
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,201
I already start searching groom for her

385
00:24:49,386 --> 00:24:51,534
Aren't we good enough?

386
00:24:53,573 --> 00:24:56,615
- Bro, PK and CK deserves more...

387
00:24:56,694 --> 00:24:58,979
- ...but not sure whether it's good
- or bad

388
00:24:59,073 --> 00:25:01,924
- Kid, do you want to stay here
- Nope, let's leave

389
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:06,048
- Let's go home
- This is the last stop Kid!

390
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:20,766
It's a shame to make a future district
collector to do household job

391
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:23,542
HELLO!

392
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:28,948
Hi Machi(friend), How are you?

393
00:25:29,065 --> 00:25:31,995
- Hey Collector, so when did you...
- come from Chennai?

394
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,009
Yesterday

395
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:35,432
- yesterday means?
- Wednesday!

396
00:25:36,174 --> 00:25:39,376
- Why didn't you come...
- to meet us Mango!

397
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:43,049
- Dude, let me impress her please.
- ok fine!

398
00:25:44,768 --> 00:25:45,901
- Uncle
- Grandpa

399
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:46,987
- Aunty
- Grandma

400
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,298
- Welcome
- What's all this?

401
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,752
I just bought everything
needed for Tulasi function

402
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:54,900
Elder uncle agreed, I kindly
request you also to agree

403
00:25:54,925 --> 00:25:56,581
- so that the function
- will be excellent

404
00:25:56,606 --> 00:25:57,606
Did my brother agreed?

405
00:25:58,198 --> 00:26:01,791
Your sister and Tulasi has taken care
of them and they owe her that much

406
00:26:02,026 --> 00:26:04,338
- When is the function?
- 3rd evening Aunty

407
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,393
6 PM with heavy feast!

408
00:26:06,518 --> 00:26:08,588
So you will be ready for
marriage after the function

409
00:26:09,057 --> 00:26:14,409
- If uncle agrees for it, then...
- will print marriage invitation

410
00:26:14,604 --> 00:26:20,268
Aunty, uncle's cough is increasing
day by day, give some medication

411
00:26:20,385 --> 00:26:22,641
- have some food
- not interested in leftovers!

412
00:26:22,704 --> 00:26:24,133
Don't spoil the marriage proposal!

413
00:26:24,175 --> 00:26:25,815
- Son-in-law
- Uncle?

414
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:31,178
Just imagine Maangani coming
to our village as collector,

415
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:37,216
- Let's raise our voice!
- Till last breath!

416
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:38,916
It'll be awesome!

417
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:40,315
Wow!! Excellent Uncle!

418
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:44,268
How about she signs the
paper in the green ink?

419
00:26:44,307 --> 00:26:45,307
It will be in green colour

420
00:26:45,744 --> 00:26:48,401
It will be a proud moment Uncle!

421
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:50,752
So make sure no one disturbs that goal!

422
00:26:50,784 --> 00:26:53,518
Uncle, everything will
happen as per her destiny.

423
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:56,885
- Lets think positive!
- If not?

424
00:26:57,228 --> 00:27:00,126
Little Sharp tongue! go!

425
00:27:00,198 --> 00:27:01,643
Get lost!

426
00:27:03,643 --> 00:27:07,080
Ok, I will leave now and
will come later... Uncle!

427
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:12,426
Go and fetch your brother and his mom

428
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:15,576
He's not allowing to take a sip!

429
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,599
What's the matter bro?

430
00:27:18,624 --> 00:27:21,339
Did you call for us brother?

431
00:27:22,238 --> 00:27:26,769
- Hey, why did you bring everyone?
- Just a precaution

432
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:29,496
Are you rubbing shoulders in
the name of social service?

433
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:33,589
No Uncle, It's the school road and even
the ladies finds it tough to cross

434
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:37,855
on top they are supplying the liquors
24 hours for various occasions

435
00:27:37,973 --> 00:27:38,919
Is it so?

436
00:27:38,944 --> 00:27:43,372
- The black market price goes from Rs. 150 to..
- Rs. 250

437
00:27:43,768 --> 00:27:47,088
- and all the dishes are...
- pre-cooked and bad!

438
00:27:47,113 --> 00:27:49,378
- Dad
- Will you please shut up!

439
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:55,781
-Also they leave the bottles everywhere
- lots of people getting hurt because of that

440
00:27:55,886 --> 00:28:00,878
Son, don't do this, you
may invite trouble!

441
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:04,002
Are you planning to enter Politics?

442
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,612
We don't need to be in politics
to stand up for issues,

443
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:14,237
We are doing as little as
possible for this society

444
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:20,483
These questions about politics are actually keeping
the good people away from the social issues

445
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:22,010
Mass bro!

446
00:28:24,228 --> 00:28:25,666
Keep quiet Grandpa!

447
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:26,673
Shut up!

448
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:33,143
Guys, they will do anything to
uphold their pride, be careful

449
00:28:33,182 --> 00:28:39,080
If they consider those things as pride, then we
should be proud for what our brothers did!

450
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,113
Why are you here?

451
00:28:41,172 --> 00:28:42,815
Tulasi, you go home!

452
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:44,705
She's telling the truth!

453
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:50,877
I'm directly benefited by shutting down
the wine shop, so leave it brother

454
00:28:51,034 --> 00:28:53,065
Who will touch them when you are here?

455
00:28:53,182 --> 00:28:55,994
Don't ask me anything if
something happens to them!

456
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,096
Deal, don't ask us if
anything happens to them!

457
00:29:00,175 --> 00:29:01,175
Yeah, deal!

458
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,477
Let's move

459
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:12,605
Send them away, they need
to prepare for function

460
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,853
Just be careful in the function

461
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,844
Welcome all!

462
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,095
Welcome!

463
00:29:28,993 --> 00:29:33,406
Yeah, do it with smiling face
and they will give money!

464
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,059
- What about me?
- Your getting from Dubai, so keep quiet

465
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:39,301
Smart! she took the money

466
00:29:47,897 --> 00:29:55,724
You are born for me!

467
00:29:55,816 --> 00:30:03,980
To give me all the happiness!

468
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:18,701
You are born for me!

469
00:30:19,143 --> 00:30:27,091
To give me all the happiness!

470
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:34,759
You hit me like thunder
and gave me love and war!

471
00:30:34,975 --> 00:30:43,099
Your love sizzles like water out
of the sluice and fill me in jar!

472
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:46,045
You are the sound of my life!

473
00:30:46,455 --> 00:30:50,010
You came as a fresh breeze

474
00:30:50,928 --> 00:30:53,970
The beautifully woven saree,

475
00:30:54,192 --> 00:30:57,942
When you wear my heart
becomes carefree

476
00:30:58,267 --> 00:31:05,649
You are born for me!

477
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:14,064
To give me all the happiness!

478
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:21,505
You hit me like thunder
and gave me love and war!

479
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:29,406
Your love sizzles like water out
of the sluice and fill me in jar!

480
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:34,411
You are born for me!

481
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:37,633
So, are you happy?

482
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:39,326
Yes brother, happy.

483
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:43,310
Did you notice that elder one
neither came inside nor had food

484
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,565
- yes, he left.
- is it?

485
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:48,567
What's the grievance?

486
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:52,328
Kotravai, looks like good collection?

487
00:31:52,445 --> 00:31:58,617
Bro, you used to mock Maangani with names,

488
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:03,096
But now your eyes are glued on
her in front of whole world!

489
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:05,857
What? Did Maangani
came to the function?

490
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:06,612
wow!

491
00:32:06,637 --> 00:32:07,681
I didn't see her

492
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:08,487
wow!

493
00:32:08,591 --> 00:32:11,377
Enough bro, just be honest.

494
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,502
It's unconditional love!

495
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:17,249
- Unconditional huh?
- Love! Love!

496
00:32:17,414 --> 00:32:19,445
Shut up, PubG maniac!

497
00:32:19,654 --> 00:32:24,705
It means, I love her even if she
doesn't look at me or talk to me

498
00:32:24,914 --> 00:32:27,752
I just love everything she does,

499
00:32:28,456 --> 00:32:32,948
- I love her without any reason, if you scold her
- then also he will love her

500
00:32:34,229 --> 00:32:36,208
How did you fall for her?

501
00:32:36,241 --> 00:32:40,251
When she went to Chennai for
studies, I kept thinking about her

502
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:44,621
but I keep doing my work
and didn't disturb her

503
00:32:45,378 --> 00:32:49,935
- Not only talking, even thinking about her...
- also called as LOVE!

504
00:32:50,013 --> 00:32:51,627
Good timing kid!

505
00:32:51,732 --> 00:32:53,294
This is too much my dear brother.

506
00:32:55,168 --> 00:32:57,434
Let's keep this as our little secret

507
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:59,025
I won't bro!

508
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,794
Great timing! when did you came bro?

509
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:03,110
I'm here since the start

510
00:33:03,211 --> 00:33:06,987
- Is he loving me since 12th grade?
- I think even before that

511
00:33:07,274 --> 00:33:09,825
He conceals his intention
in front of everyone

512
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:14,695
My dad clarified that my goal is
to become the district collector

513
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,757
I will become district collector and
come to our village in Government Jeep

514
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,940
Then skip it,

515
00:33:20,574 --> 00:33:24,532
He's an idiot to call it
an unconditional love

516
00:33:24,643 --> 00:33:26,726
Unconditional love?

517
00:33:28,627 --> 00:33:33,600
You don't get distracted, your aim
is to become district collector

518
00:33:34,826 --> 00:33:36,544
Hey, What is this?

519
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:39,721
Avaram flower, good for health

520
00:33:39,746 --> 00:33:43,990
We mix this in Tea, keeps us
away from diabetics, cancer

521
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,075
Oh, I heard this before,

522
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:50,190
Food is medicine, go traditional way,

523
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,976
Don't fry, just boil,

524
00:33:53,107 --> 00:33:56,987
Your brother lectures this
for hours, it's torture.

525
00:33:58,643 --> 00:34:03,981
Do you remember that you had
short hair in 12th grade?

526
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:10,429
My brother took rabbit's blood, soaked
in white cloth and dried it,...

527
00:34:10,477 --> 00:34:14,711
...then picked aloe Vera, mixed
with coconut oil... for what?

528
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:16,560
to make your hair strong and long

529
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,112
You were delighted by the result, but now?

530
00:34:20,154 --> 00:34:22,471
You forgot everything?

531
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:27,527
I remember now, I'm sorry dear.

532
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:34,247
First, stop faking your accent

533
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:38,101
- Are you here for donation for horse festival?
- Yes sir,

534
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:40,653
So, how much my elder uncle gave?

535
00:34:40,705 --> 00:34:42,951
He promised Rs. 25,000

536
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,601
I will give Rs. 10,000 in
the name of my grandpa

537
00:34:46,405 --> 00:34:48,774
- Cash or Card?
- you haven't upgraded to Paytm?

538
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:51,572
smiling face!

539
00:34:51,613 --> 00:34:55,623
Along with Rs. 10,000,
sponsor 2 Tins oil as well

540
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:59,893
- Ok! For temple or your home?
- For temple only

541
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,410
I'm buying doll horse in my
sister's name for offering

542
00:35:03,462 --> 00:35:04,462
wow great!

543
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:05,623
Why now brother?

544
00:35:05,676 --> 00:35:08,332
Just an offering to get you married

545
00:35:08,514 --> 00:35:09,686
Rs. 1001 in my name

546
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:13,514
Even your nephew gave Rs. 10000

547
00:35:13,582 --> 00:35:14,582
Rs.10000 !

548
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:18,594
He's oil factory owner, he can afford.

549
00:35:18,647 --> 00:35:19,740
True!

550
00:35:19,845 --> 00:35:22,136
Same like his father.

551
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:26,478
My dad is better than him, write Rs.25K

552
00:35:26,564 --> 00:35:28,204
Ok Sir.

553
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:31,980
What will they do with Rs.
25, write down Rs.2000

554
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:36,771
But sir, your son meant Rs.25000

555
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:40,313
What? come close my dear son,
it will be easy to spit on you

556
00:35:40,366 --> 00:35:41,824
Make it Rs.10001

557
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:43,881
Such an honor sir!

558
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:59,023
Wow! Super.

559
00:36:01,386 --> 00:36:03,860
Bro, look at that, it's fantastic.

560
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,115
- Son-in-law
- Uncle?

561
00:36:07,183 --> 00:36:10,292
- horse function, no party?
- there you go!

562
00:36:11,073 --> 00:36:14,224
Oh my, I could have married a
donkey instead of your daughter

563
00:36:14,278 --> 00:36:15,893
Long live your legacy!

564
00:36:15,987 --> 00:36:18,122
Hope you live long to see that!

565
00:36:18,149 --> 00:36:20,362
- Son-in-law, why are you spoiling him?

566
00:36:20,414 --> 00:36:23,278
Who knows when he will leave us?

567
00:36:23,617 --> 00:36:25,466
Welcome uncle

568
00:36:25,492 --> 00:36:28,278
So wannabe collector, what's up?

569
00:36:28,461 --> 00:36:30,388
Hey, go away

570
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,054
Tulasi, this offering is for her

571
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:39,220
- did he mention about this?
- No, I came to know few minutes back

572
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,300
How much you paid for function?

573
00:36:40,341 --> 00:36:43,440
I became generous and wrote Rs. 501

574
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:44,466
Just Rs.501?

575
00:36:44,508 --> 00:36:52,971
Hello sir, I wrote down Rs. 501 in your
name, still waiting for the payment

576
00:36:53,138 --> 00:36:55,101
On the way! on the way!

577
00:36:55,528 --> 00:37:00,918
- Why are you looking sad?
- Enough bro, give some space

578
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:02,877
- Bro
- Yes?

579
00:37:02,939 --> 00:37:05,204
- That's Kumaran's son, right?
- Why are you asking?

580
00:37:05,273 --> 00:37:08,553
- For Tulasi
- What about your cousins CK or PK?

581
00:37:08,581 --> 00:37:10,586
I thought of expanding
the relatives circle.

582
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:12,903
Aren't you fed up with
existing relatives?

583
00:37:17,149 --> 00:37:18,606
I asked you not to talk bro.

584
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:20,429
- Shut up
- Good looking horse

585
00:37:20,508 --> 00:37:22,825
Yes, very nice!

586
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,060
I'm gonna kill you

587
00:37:24,258 --> 00:37:25,258
Don't disturb me!

588
00:37:25,742 --> 00:37:26,940
What's unconditional love?

589
00:37:28,034 --> 00:37:29,034
You told her?

590
00:37:29,076 --> 00:37:32,747
Well, it means I like you
for no particular reasons

591
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:35,977
Even if the whole
world mocks you,

592
00:37:36,106 --> 00:37:39,230
- your uncle's watching you...
- I know, but he isn't smart enough

593
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:45,267
Even, If you fall for someone but realise I'm the
better option, then also I will like you

594
00:37:45,357 --> 00:37:48,039
that's called unconditional love

595
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:50,070
She looks like catla fish

596
00:37:53,935 --> 00:37:56,981
- Hey how are you?
- I'm good thanks!

597
00:37:57,373 --> 00:37:58,570
- Bro
- yes?

598
00:37:58,727 --> 00:38:00,393
- Maangani
- what about her?

599
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,284
- I want to get close
- So?

600
00:38:03,362 --> 00:38:05,289
- Why don't you help me?
- What?

601
00:38:05,472 --> 00:38:08,596
- I'm your brother, give respect
- Ok bro, sorry!

602
00:38:08,867 --> 00:38:11,393
- Look there, start praying
- I know.

603
00:38:29,562 --> 00:38:30,916
Acharya Devo Bava

604
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:33,510
The issue is, this is agricultural land

605
00:38:33,608 --> 00:38:37,140
So he got stay order against
selling it as commercial property

606
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:38,884
Why are you staring at me?

607
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:43,338
Looks like he sent this along
with wine shop petition

608
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:46,713
Unfortunately Judge noticed
it now and gave stay order!

609
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:51,530
Our defense is that, we claim that this
is not used for farming for past 10 years

610
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:55,759
But his counter defense is attacking my
reputation in bar council and calls me fake

611
00:38:55,799 --> 00:39:00,382
He complained that I graduated through
backdoor and made it personal

612
00:39:00,466 --> 00:39:02,044
Finally what I suggest is that,

613
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:11,232
Book a suite in Le-meridian, I will
brainstorm to file this case in high court

614
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,490
- What I suggest is that,
- Yes?

615
00:39:13,565 --> 00:39:15,856
- Just shut up!
- You will end up in Jail!

616
00:39:15,928 --> 00:39:17,620
It's gonna be tough to sell plots

617
00:39:17,706 --> 00:39:21,364
The buyers are scared about
the legal issues Uncle

618
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:23,590
and on top, we got a stupid lawyer

619
00:39:24,811 --> 00:39:26,032
Greetings!

620
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:30,507
We got loan and purchased
this land, hope it's clean

621
00:39:30,627 --> 00:39:34,481
Don't worry, I will fix it in two weeks.

622
00:39:34,654 --> 00:39:36,112
- Hello Mr. Lawyer
- Yes?

623
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,606
All good?

624
00:39:37,685 --> 00:39:41,486
Can't you see? We are all good!

625
00:39:41,565 --> 00:39:45,629
- We trust you
- you will end up in street!

626
00:39:48,194 --> 00:39:49,194
Who are they?

627
00:39:49,396 --> 00:39:53,145
Bro, are they here for festival donation?

628
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:55,580
Who filed the case against plot sales?

629
00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:59,771
My dad requested and my uncle gave inputs
and I wrote the petition, so what now?

630
00:39:59,852 --> 00:40:00,852
Keep quiet kid!

631
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:02,460
Those are our lands,

632
00:40:02,509 --> 00:40:05,191
Who are you to shut down
wine shop and stop plot sales?

633
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:12,039
I saved Rs.125 everyday and bought
that land, now you put us in loss.

634
00:40:12,064 --> 00:40:15,203
Rs. 125 per day? I heard this somewhere!

635
00:40:15,242 --> 00:40:17,346
- Why are you diverting the topic
- You need to answer for Rs. 125!

636
00:40:17,503 --> 00:40:19,794
Bro, I got this.

637
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,751
Oi! You guys are from 100
days employment plan right?

638
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,977
Your supervisor is there, look!

639
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:29,244
Bro, they brought these
poor guys for few bucks

640
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:31,846
Guys, break them to pieces!

641
00:40:31,893 --> 00:40:34,403
Bro, Time to show your power

642
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:38,233
Son, Let's take rest, I
don't get into fights!

643
00:40:38,257 --> 00:40:39,257
Ok!

644
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,745
This way son, Bro, give that mic

645
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,610
Hey, Don't do this, stop!

646
00:41:01,678 --> 00:41:04,881
As the Horse festival concluded,

647
00:41:04,945 --> 00:41:08,500
We present you a special Sunday show

648
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:11,741
We request all the people to come here,

649
00:41:11,899 --> 00:41:15,024
and grace the occasion.

650
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,047
This is a humble request
from the festival committee

651
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:27,885
Mic set bro, please dedicate
a SUPER STAR song for my bro

652
00:41:39,198 --> 00:41:42,089
Uncle, a baldy is behind you!

653
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,757
Wow! That checkered shirt guy
getting it slow and steady!

654
00:41:53,534 --> 00:41:58,261
As per the proverb goes, my bro
is kicking the wrong doers

655
00:41:58,286 --> 00:42:03,000
and the thugs keep adding in,
Here comes our Mr. Thothathiri

656
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,552
Mr. Thothathiri, public review please.

657
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:10,119
Please give space for public and transport

658
00:42:10,276 --> 00:42:13,817
Thanks for your advice!

659
00:42:23,363 --> 00:42:27,909
The fight is reaching the climax.

660
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:41,464
My dear Husband, money can't
replace your presence here.

661
00:42:41,698 --> 00:42:43,546
I applied leave, I will come for delivery.

662
00:42:43,571 --> 00:42:46,567
- I want you to be here for delivery
- Sure dear.

663
00:42:47,427 --> 00:42:50,242
- How are you guys?
- Fine grandpa

664
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,068
What happened?

665
00:42:52,093 --> 00:42:57,291
We came in a mini van, it
toppled and we got injured

666
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,322
Get some oil

667
00:42:59,484 --> 00:43:01,373
- What happened guys?
- come here son!

668
00:43:01,467 --> 00:43:06,275
Yes, an overloaded mini van toppled.

669
00:43:06,432 --> 00:43:11,636
This doesn't look like
an accidental injury!!

670
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:16,674
Here they are!

671
00:43:18,031 --> 00:43:20,374
That's my grandson as well as my apprentice

672
00:43:20,635 --> 00:43:22,405
You guys sit down

673
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,436
Grandpa, he was the one
who has beaten us in pulp

674
00:43:24,593 --> 00:43:26,650
Yes, he's the one!

675
00:43:26,714 --> 00:43:29,354
Already there's a conspiracy that
you are sending me patients,

676
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:32,959
why are you proving that?

677
00:43:32,984 --> 00:43:34,471
Sit down, Sit down guys!

678
00:43:34,496 --> 00:43:37,204
Too much crowd, you also apply medicines

679
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:40,425
No sir, we will wait!

680
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,004
Don't worry, he's thorough professional

681
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,094
He's the one who treats me!

682
00:43:46,176 --> 00:43:49,218
Get up, How did I hit you?

683
00:43:54,819 --> 00:43:57,790
Don't shout, I haven't started yet.

684
00:44:01,696 --> 00:44:03,883
Now, lift your hand.

685
00:44:04,066 --> 00:44:06,149
Good, who is next?

686
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:08,310
Looks like fallen while
talking in mobile phone!

687
00:44:12,862 --> 00:44:13,862
That's it, go

688
00:44:14,956 --> 00:44:17,455
That's it mate, go and take rest

689
00:44:17,508 --> 00:44:22,820
I heard your cousin is getting married to
someone else and not Tulasi, is it true?

690
00:44:24,484 --> 00:44:26,231
He always places richness
above relationship

691
00:44:26,336 --> 00:44:28,627
True, I'm worried about mom.

692
00:44:28,784 --> 00:44:33,054
So the police groom ditched us!

693
00:44:33,185 --> 00:44:35,502
But, I think it's good for you Tulasi

694
00:44:35,527 --> 00:44:36,057
How?

695
00:44:36,158 --> 00:44:39,856
Yes mom, Just imagine him
as our groom for a minute!

696
00:44:39,971 --> 00:44:44,763
Aunty, ha ha ha ha!
how are you? ha ha ha ha!

697
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:49,033
Brother in law, ha ha ha ha!
I can't even imagine that!

698
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:52,705
Tulasi, Is dinner ready? ha ha ha ha!

699
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,909
Don't laugh, just imagine your
situation after marriage.

700
00:44:55,968 --> 00:44:58,565
The second cousin, CK is much better

701
00:44:58,683 --> 00:45:01,031
Aunty, how are you?

702
00:45:01,062 --> 00:45:03,569
Tulasi, Shall we go for
"Darbar" for Pongal?

703
00:45:03,632 --> 00:45:05,365
He will be the right fit!

704
00:45:05,462 --> 00:45:08,691
Oh enough, I don't believe that.

705
00:45:08,743 --> 00:45:10,644
Trust me Mom,

706
00:45:10,731 --> 00:45:13,048
I will take care of it, you
don't show your grievance

707
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:15,852
We will all attend PK's marriage
with big smile in our face

708
00:45:15,905 --> 00:45:17,857
A big smile, sure bro!

709
00:45:17,936 --> 00:45:19,826
Yes my smarty sister!

710
00:45:22,295 --> 00:45:24,925
Grandeur preparation!

711
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:29,066
These function are conducted for
pride and not for blessings!

712
00:45:29,275 --> 00:45:31,279
- son in law!
- yes uncle?

713
00:45:31,384 --> 00:45:33,564
- Marriage function!
- Yes, it is.

714
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:36,175
- Non Veg feast is there
- Veg is also available

715
00:45:36,227 --> 00:45:40,160
- How about small party?
- No way, get lost!

716
00:45:42,461 --> 00:45:44,690
Welcome, Welcome!

717
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:48,154
- Welcome Tulasi, how are you?
- I'm good uncle, how are you?

718
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:49,738
- Welcome Aunty
- Greetings!

719
00:45:49,868 --> 00:45:52,654
Tulasi, you are late!

720
00:45:52,759 --> 00:45:55,128
- Sorry Aunty
- Where's your brother?

721
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:56,378
He is inside

722
00:45:56,509 --> 00:45:58,019
Ok, carry on.

723
00:46:02,973 --> 00:46:05,655
Why are you late?

724
00:46:05,832 --> 00:46:10,113
It's fine if one person from the
family comes early, isn't it partner?

725
00:46:10,165 --> 00:46:13,654
What? how is it related?

726
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,788
think that you are my
wife and you will get it.

727
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:16,519
WHAT?

728
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:20,774
- Kani, how is this guy looking?
- Good, why are you asking?

729
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,769
- Finding match for Tulasi
- What about my brother?

730
00:46:22,874 --> 00:46:25,764
Your brother? What's the assurance
that he will not ditch us?

731
00:46:25,815 --> 00:46:27,560
- Nothing's going as per our will
- Maangani

732
00:46:27,612 --> 00:46:31,388
What are you talking to Arumpon?
Your father is searching for you,

733
00:46:32,028 --> 00:46:34,059
Great! take her away!

734
00:46:37,174 --> 00:46:40,455
I also wish to wear a saree

735
00:46:41,923 --> 00:46:46,271
I will get a maroon colour
saree for you from Kanchipuram

736
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,866
I was just talking about the saree,
why are you diverting the topic?

737
00:46:49,919 --> 00:46:52,600
They got both veg and
non-veg counters here!

738
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:56,767
Yes! Yes! someone is trying
to build a proposal here!

739
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:57,855
I can see that!

740
00:46:57,965 --> 00:47:00,986
I think you are all spoiling
my district collector dream!

741
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:05,073
Please place your foot on
ground and think twice!

742
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,712
- Bro, don't spoil it!
- Ok OK

743
00:47:10,603 --> 00:47:11,852
Dude, focus there

744
00:47:21,494 --> 00:47:23,727
That's your last laugh!

745
00:47:24,043 --> 00:47:26,149
She's too modest.

746
00:47:26,254 --> 00:47:31,175
I will keep my head high during marriage.

747
00:47:31,201 --> 00:47:33,883
Let the guy be modest!

748
00:47:33,988 --> 00:47:38,337
Yes Partner, I want my
wife to be like that only.

749
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:41,122
Oi! I didn't mean you.

750
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:44,248
But, I'm talking about
you only, is it wrong?

751
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,280
Not wrong partner!

752
00:47:46,566 --> 00:47:47,894
Good timing kid!

753
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,029
Smart like his dad!

754
00:47:50,054 --> 00:47:51,201
Not like you?

755
00:47:51,644 --> 00:47:53,467
Don't talk like that in front of my son

756
00:47:53,492 --> 00:47:56,825
Let's talk about our
family then, is that fine?

757
00:47:57,016 --> 00:47:59,229
They are moving fast!

758
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,311
Pons! One minute!

759
00:48:19,556 --> 00:48:21,951
I have a question for you,

760
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,222
Which fruit do you like ?

761
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:29,415
- My sister will misinterpret, let me go now
- Son!

762
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:31,446
- let's go son
- Yes mom

763
00:48:31,472 --> 00:48:33,112
- I will talk to you later
- wait!

764
00:48:33,165 --> 00:48:35,274
Who is important for you?
your mom or myself?

765
00:48:35,378 --> 00:48:36,940
- My mom
- What about me?

766
00:48:37,411 --> 00:48:38,869
Son, it's getting late!

767
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:40,543
Yes, mom give me a minute.

768
00:48:40,665 --> 00:48:44,180
I think she's testing
him, he's stammering.

769
00:48:44,285 --> 00:48:46,928
I don't understand your question dear.

770
00:48:47,095 --> 00:48:48,240
How will you take care of me?

771
00:48:48,543 --> 00:48:51,437
Hey Bro, why are you wasting time?
let's move.

772
00:48:51,492 --> 00:48:52,683
Just a minute Mom!

773
00:48:52,751 --> 00:48:55,965
I will take care of you the
same way I look after my mom!

774
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:05,809
You should take care of me like how you
will take care of your little princess

775
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,543
Will you do that, partner?

776
00:49:30,315 --> 00:49:37,551
Oh my love, Oh my love, Crush me like henna

777
00:49:37,656 --> 00:49:45,232
and apply it on your hands !

778
00:49:45,467 --> 00:49:52,732
The universe shows me
the depth of your love

779
00:49:52,837 --> 00:50:00,147
You tie me like a kite with your eyes

780
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:03,696
I'm eternally happy

781
00:50:03,775 --> 00:50:10,712
Your presence makes me go crazy

782
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:18,542
I'm in cloud nine,

783
00:50:19,253 --> 00:50:21,883
because you are mine!

784
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:29,227
Oh my love, Oh my love, I
will crush you like henna

785
00:50:29,383 --> 00:50:37,153
and apply it on your hands !

786
00:50:38,988 --> 00:50:39,988
Not me!

787
00:50:44,733 --> 00:50:51,217
The sound of temple bells blend with
anklets sound and results in bliss

788
00:50:51,894 --> 00:50:59,191
I feel the warmth of the
womb when you are with me

789
00:50:59,771 --> 00:51:06,508
Even the lamps looks like shining stars

790
00:51:07,057 --> 00:51:13,696
That's the result of being in love

791
00:51:13,792 --> 00:51:20,685
The way you speak, brings me peace

792
00:51:20,737 --> 00:51:25,332
I will carry you in my heart

793
00:51:25,385 --> 00:51:28,483
I'm in cloud nine,

794
00:51:29,195 --> 00:51:32,285
because you are mine!

795
00:51:32,312 --> 00:51:39,291
Oh my love, Oh my love, I
will crush you like henna

796
00:51:39,448 --> 00:51:47,581
and apply it in my hands!

797
00:51:54,985 --> 00:51:56,506
Dad, Please forgive me!

798
00:51:56,612 --> 00:51:58,758
He was waiting all this time!

799
00:51:58,805 --> 00:52:01,123
- Ask him to get lost!
- Please bless us dad!

800
00:52:01,303 --> 00:52:02,708
You won't get my blessings!

801
00:52:03,026 --> 00:52:04,244
I'm sorry dad, Please forgive me

802
00:52:04,324 --> 00:52:08,790
As expected, the second
son also ditched us.

803
00:52:09,598 --> 00:52:10,925
- Tulasi
- Yes bro?

804
00:52:11,124 --> 00:52:15,420
I will tell you a secret, don't get
upset and you should never tell mom

805
00:52:15,457 --> 00:52:18,321
- Ok deal!
- Uncle clearly told me that,

806
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:23,008
He will never agree for the
marriage proposal with his son

807
00:52:23,144 --> 00:52:27,649
How can I say this to mom, that's why I
keep looking for options, ha ha ha ha ha

808
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:32,649
Ha ha ha, he tried to pull my
legs, but I escaped, ha ha ha

809
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:36,139
- Great! super bro!
- Yes, super bro!

810
00:52:36,217 --> 00:52:38,196
- Why bro?

811
00:52:43,363 --> 00:52:45,618
Bro, do you think mom heard us?

812
00:52:45,643 --> 00:52:47,023
Shall I go and ask her?

813
00:52:47,338 --> 00:52:48,666
Don't worry, she
couldn't have heard

814
00:52:48,697 --> 00:52:50,128
She must have heard.

815
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:52,680
- What do you think Grandpa?
- She couldn't have heard.

816
00:52:52,785 --> 00:52:54,425
- What if she heard it?
- rightly said!

817
00:52:54,582 --> 00:52:57,967
Grandpa, then she will
never talk to her brothers

818
00:52:58,019 --> 00:52:59,790
True, she'll go to that extreme.

819
00:52:59,973 --> 00:53:04,894
Bro, let me repeat the words, you act
like mom,

820
00:53:04,998 --> 00:53:07,029
-  let's get the clarity
- Why bro?

821
00:53:07,082 --> 00:53:10,467
Please do it bro, If she had
heard, I need to act accordingly

822
00:53:10,712 --> 00:53:13,186
That's the price paid for being too good!

823
00:53:13,263 --> 00:53:15,815
He should be irresponsible like me!

824
00:53:15,964 --> 00:53:16,964
Grandpa,

825
00:53:17,342 --> 00:53:19,867
Ready, Action!

826
00:53:20,035 --> 00:53:23,967
Uncle clearly denied the marriage proposal

827
00:53:24,098 --> 00:53:25,920
that's why I started
seeing options for you,

828
00:53:25,954 --> 00:53:27,984
Oh my!

829
00:53:28,129 --> 00:53:29,129
What happened?

830
00:53:29,154 --> 00:53:31,705
I'm not sure bro!

831
00:53:31,779 --> 00:53:33,627
She must have heard it clear.

832
00:53:33,655 --> 00:53:37,225
Tulasi, can you please act like mom,
so that we can clarify this doubt

833
00:53:37,233 --> 00:53:38,233
Get lost, I won't do it!

834
00:53:38,504 --> 00:53:39,753
Who else is there?

835
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,844
My dear Grandsons! Leave me out!

836
00:53:44,883 --> 00:53:46,785
Grandpa, that's going solo,

837
00:53:46,889 --> 00:53:51,316
Bro, you sit here and mimic me, I will play
the mom's part and let's get it clarified

838
00:53:51,701 --> 00:53:52,701
Action!

839
00:53:52,842 --> 00:53:55,482
Grandpa, what's the dialog?

840
00:53:56,004 --> 00:53:57,592
- No,
- One more

841
00:53:57,696 --> 00:53:58,998
It'll go even more!

842
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,180
Action!

843
00:54:02,742 --> 00:54:04,023
Yes mom?

844
00:54:04,156 --> 00:54:09,774
I didn't hear it first time,
but I got it second time

845
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:13,855
Great! it's evident now.

846
00:54:13,908 --> 00:54:17,970
Everybody cheats me, I was born that way

847
00:54:18,231 --> 00:54:23,933
But I never cheated anyone and
that's why it makes me sad

848
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:25,756
Nobody cheated you mom!

849
00:54:25,983 --> 00:54:28,196
Are they evaluating me
based on my wealth?

850
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:31,706
Who are they to evaluate
about me or your sister?

851
00:54:32,756 --> 00:54:36,036
Mom, he loved that girl and
got married, what can we do?

852
00:54:36,108 --> 00:54:38,373
He eloped with her!

853
00:54:38,426 --> 00:54:40,743
They are all thieves!

854
00:54:41,504 --> 00:54:46,855
They use their son as bait to
accumulate wealth in the name of dowry!

855
00:54:46,941 --> 00:54:48,998
No one respects character

856
00:54:49,129 --> 00:54:51,785
When wealth increases,
the affection increases

857
00:54:51,993 --> 00:54:54,311
when wealth decreases,
the affection decreases

858
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,717
Everything is measured based on money

859
00:54:58,073 --> 00:55:02,161
If we have money, will
they deny your sister?

860
00:55:02,264 --> 00:55:04,139
Money mongrels!

861
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:06,152
Let's not be like them,

862
00:55:06,225 --> 00:55:11,332
If you get good sleep at
night, then you are rich

863
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:16,701
If you can't sleep at
night, then you are poor

864
00:55:16,754 --> 00:55:18,081
Good one Grandpa!

865
00:55:18,342 --> 00:55:21,519
Leave all this, I will bring
excellent groom for my sister

866
00:55:21,613 --> 00:55:26,951
I will get someone like...
like "Vijay deverakonda"

867
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:33,956
- Mango! Hello?
- Partner, Kotravai got labour pain, come here fast

868
00:55:35,129 --> 00:55:39,165
- Bro, call her husband, let her talk to him
- Yes, sure

869
00:55:39,243 --> 00:55:43,836
We are taking your wife
to hospital for delivery.

870
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:47,076
- Take her to good hospital brother
- Sure, have a word with her

871
00:55:47,493 --> 00:55:51,816
- Talk to your husband
- Kotravai, don't worry, my brothers are there

872
00:55:52,363 --> 00:55:54,107
When are you coming here?

873
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,373
Still waiting for leave approval dear.

874
00:55:56,398 --> 00:55:57,475
Give the phone,

875
00:55:57,543 --> 00:56:01,420
Shall I call your owner and
say that your father expired?

876
00:56:01,465 --> 00:56:03,246
- Leave it bro!
- Then only he'll come here!

877
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:08,954
What's the point in earning Lakhs if you
can't stay next to her during delivery?

878
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:12,019
No one can compensate your presence bro!

879
00:56:12,124 --> 00:56:16,889
- I get it now bro!
- Don't cry, we will take care.

880
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:28,151
I will kill you if you leave
me alone for my delivery

881
00:56:28,264 --> 00:56:31,206
No way, the moment you get conceived...

882
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:32,300
He'll run away!

883
00:56:32,387 --> 00:56:33,402
Brother!

884
00:56:33,602 --> 00:56:35,633
I'll take good care of you!

885
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:38,107
- How will you take care of me?
- Let me explain..

886
00:56:38,238 --> 00:56:40,555
- Elder brother,
- Yes sister?

887
00:56:40,677 --> 00:56:43,046
- Do me a favour
- Yes, what do you want?

888
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,790
Stop the vehicle and get me an auto

889
00:56:45,815 --> 00:56:51,310
- Why?
- Looks like these two lovebirds will kill me

890
00:56:51,483 --> 00:56:53,722
He's going damn slow

891
00:56:53,826 --> 00:56:55,414
The baby inside will feel
the shock if I go fast

892
00:56:55,467 --> 00:56:58,826
Why don't you get down and push the
car, that will be smoother ride

893
00:56:58,851 --> 00:57:00,752
Why don't you push the accelerator!

894
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:02,367
Dad, cucumber!

895
00:57:02,576 --> 00:57:04,654
Bro, stop over, let's get some cucumber

896
00:57:04,686 --> 00:57:10,518
Idiots! are we on tour here? I'm in Pain!

897
00:57:10,352 --> 00:57:12,282
Uncle, we admitted her
in private hospital

898
00:57:12,298 --> 00:57:13,298
What? Why private hospital?

899
00:57:13,634 --> 00:57:15,852
Why didn't you go for government hospital?

900
00:57:15,928 --> 00:57:18,454
Maangani took that decision uncle!

901
00:57:18,506 --> 00:57:19,506
How much is the advance?

902
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:23,636
You'll get heart attack if I say that!
so come here fast.

903
00:57:24,365 --> 00:57:26,683
- Is he crying dad?
- Yes my son!

904
00:57:26,761 --> 00:57:28,480
Poor guy!

905
00:57:29,419 --> 00:57:30,419
Take one,

906
00:57:31,402 --> 00:57:34,950
In his account only, Also
ordered biryani for lunch

907
00:57:38,331 --> 00:57:40,128
Looks like her mom

908
00:57:45,745 --> 00:57:47,802
Don't kiss her like that,
she'll get infected

909
00:57:47,934 --> 00:57:50,465
- then show me how?
- Really?

910
00:57:50,523 --> 00:57:54,794
- Girls love kiss on forehead
- Is it?

911
00:57:54,886 --> 00:57:57,464
- Girls love long kiss as well
- Is it?

912
00:57:57,542 --> 00:57:59,807
Long kiss not on forehead!

913
00:58:01,492 --> 00:58:02,560
I got it!

914
00:58:02,637 --> 00:58:03,991
Why don't you give one?

915
00:58:09,142 --> 00:58:10,142
sister in law!

916
00:58:10,992 --> 00:58:12,762
She's sleeping

917
00:58:14,195 --> 00:58:18,023
Yes true, get lost guys!

918
00:58:19,012 --> 00:58:21,433
Cute baby but she deserves better mom!

919
00:58:22,737 --> 00:58:27,892
Our first kiss should be today!

920
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:31,825
It will be memorable for us always!

921
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:34,784
Even after marriage,

922
00:58:35,382 --> 00:58:36,528
not me,

923
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:40,506
Oh god, she started crying,

Here he come!

926
00:58:45,591 --> 00:58:46,770
Who asked you to admit here?

927
00:58:46,822 --> 00:58:51,249
First go and check your heir,
then worry about money

928
00:58:51,399 --> 00:58:52,700
Go and see her first!

929
00:58:54,029 --> 00:58:59,289
You lend money for interest
right, I will spend it all.

930
00:59:01,128 --> 00:59:04,331
Girls like it when a guy hug from behind

931
00:59:04,643 --> 00:59:07,195
- What about you?
- I too like it

932
00:59:07,283 --> 00:59:10,607
- The kid is 3 Kg and strong
- I will get back to you!

933
00:59:11,389 --> 00:59:12,389
Let's continue

934
00:59:14,279 --> 00:59:17,117
You should carry me around,

935
00:59:17,419 --> 00:59:18,811
and give tight hugs

936
00:59:19,425 --> 00:59:21,300
There shouldn't be any gap for breathing!

937
00:59:22,055 --> 00:59:25,519
That type of hug will stand
evident for our love!

938
00:59:25,884 --> 00:59:27,862
Will you hug me now?

939
00:59:30,563 --> 00:59:34,313
Hug? I'm shy type,

00:59:34,399 --> 00:59:38,071

941
00:59:38,615 --> 00:59:41,229
You will see that soon!

00:59:45,998 --> 00:59:48,315

953
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,169

01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:34,142

958
01:00:39,738 --> 01:00:42,992
We are going to have a feast!

959
01:00:43,696 --> 01:00:46,742
Super human survives by eating Iron pieces!

960
01:00:46,821 --> 01:00:50,440
Hmm, this guy should try my wife's
cooking then he can claim super human!

961
01:00:50,545 --> 01:00:56,144
Son, our neighbour is coming with a
marriage proposal for you and your sister?

962
01:00:57,055 --> 01:00:58,055
Let's proceed with it mom!

963
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:02,029
What? She's older than you brother!

964
01:01:02,523 --> 01:01:04,425
So what?

965
01:01:04,469 --> 01:01:08,539
Ramayi is 55 years old and still
unmarried, she'll be good match for you!

966
01:01:08,572 --> 01:01:10,981
Bro! but the groom looks good!

967
01:01:11,023 --> 01:01:12,092
I don't like him!

968
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:14,164
It doesn't matter.

969
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:17,472
So get used to it and change your mindset

970
01:01:17,576 --> 01:01:20,982
Look Mom, My brother Loves Maangani,
so talk to your brother first

971
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:23,300
and then I will marry whomever you wish

972
01:01:23,378 --> 01:01:25,565
Don't you have courage to step up?

973
01:01:26,138 --> 01:01:29,132
I told clearly not to engage with
them, but no one is listening

974
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,232
Mom, Let's proceed with your
wish, Tulasi, please leave it

975
01:01:32,267 --> 01:01:36,042
If you truly love her,
you won't leave her ever

976
01:01:37,545 --> 01:01:39,758
What if he loves his
sister more than anyone?

977
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:42,630
Shut up bro!

978
01:01:48,576 --> 01:01:53,498
Uncle, They both like each other.

979
01:01:54,383 --> 01:01:59,955
Elder uncle didn't agree for my marriage,
at least you fulfill this wish uncle.

980
01:02:00,451 --> 01:02:04,513
My mom and brother are taking
wrong decisions for my sake.

981
01:02:04,539 --> 01:02:09,945
You need to take a good decision
uncle, Please uncle, Please

982
01:02:09,998 --> 01:02:11,555
What did you say about
my elder brother?

983
01:02:12,915 --> 01:02:20,050
My elder brother is very
clear about relationship

984
01:02:20,135 --> 01:02:25,578
and you know well why he rejected you!
No one will marry you!

985
01:02:25,753 --> 01:02:28,201
Get up and get lost.

986
01:02:30,003 --> 01:02:32,924
Dad, why would you hurt
her with your words?

987
01:02:32,979 --> 01:02:36,279
I know how to make alliance
for you, so keep quiet

988
01:02:36,722 --> 01:02:39,664
- Uncle
- Get out!

989
01:02:59,178 --> 01:03:03,683
Uncle, If you don't like Tulasi then
ignore her, why do you insult her birth?

990
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:06,372
What if she takes any wrong
decision in depression?

991
01:03:07,179 --> 01:03:10,225
No one got any rights to talk about her!

992
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:11,891
- Hey
- Just sit down!

993
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,079
Show your authority
in your station

994
01:03:14,497 --> 01:03:18,533
You were brought up with
silver spoon unlike us

995
01:03:19,066 --> 01:03:20,680
You will never understand!

996
01:03:21,894 --> 01:03:24,248
You can decide your
alliance as per your wish

997
01:03:24,691 --> 01:03:27,972
We are dependent on our hard
work and not on your blessings

998
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:31,748
Why are you talking like
this to your uncle?

999
01:03:31,801 --> 01:03:36,071
Aunty, no one should disrespect
people, else this will be the result

1000
01:03:38,337 --> 01:03:42,443
Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh my god!
how do you manage bro?

1001
01:03:44,957 --> 01:03:49,513
Grandpa, I spoke to my uncle,
he's fine with this alliance

1002
01:03:49,565 --> 01:03:53,288
But they expect to setup a
business for brother-in-law!

1003
01:03:53,313 --> 01:03:54,375
I'm not surprised!

1004
01:03:54,436 --> 01:03:55,841
We will organise it bro

1005
01:04:02,065 --> 01:04:05,945
How can you agree to it? Didn't
you analyse the bloodline?

1006
01:04:06,036 --> 01:04:09,489
I thought you all approve
Tulasi as your own

1007
01:04:09,529 --> 01:04:12,539
She doesn't come from our bloodline!

1008
01:04:12,644 --> 01:04:14,792
I have made alliance with
your family with pride,

1009
01:04:14,839 --> 01:04:19,104
Likewise, whomever you make alliance
with should have some dignity!

1010
01:04:19,962 --> 01:04:20,769
Fine, do it then!

1011
01:04:20,959 --> 01:04:23,797
I expect your participation as well

1012
01:04:23,827 --> 01:04:26,263
I will just be a spectator

1013
01:04:26,352 --> 01:04:28,216
Sister, what should I do now?

1014
01:04:28,279 --> 01:04:31,013
Brother, she's a good girl
and so please proceed

1015
01:04:31,935 --> 01:04:33,513
You are always welcome son!

1016
01:04:33,983 --> 01:04:36,560
But, I'm in tight spot now,

1017
01:04:37,269 --> 01:04:38,098
Yes Sir?

1018
01:04:38,123 --> 01:04:41,482
My cousin needs Rs.5 Lakhs as loan,

1019
01:04:42,134 --> 01:04:45,727
He'll be prompt in repaying
interest, please help

1020
01:04:45,962 --> 01:04:48,409
Sir, but I am the one
who got loan from you!

1021
01:04:48,462 --> 01:04:51,560
- Just do what I ask for
- I don't get it sir!

1022
01:04:53,358 --> 01:04:55,753
Collect from him in the evening.

1023
01:04:56,483 --> 01:04:59,242
Make sure you pay the interest
before 5th of every month

1024
01:04:59,321 --> 01:05:00,336
Sure Uncle.

1025
01:05:00,493 --> 01:05:01,925
Spend wisely.

1026
01:05:02,594 --> 01:05:03,896
Thanks a lot Uncle.

1027
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:08,097
Yes Sir?

1028
01:05:08,175 --> 01:05:11,378
I will give you Rs.5 Lakhs, hand
it over to him as your money

1029
01:05:11,899 --> 01:05:14,305
- Collect the interest every month and give it to me
- Ok Sir!

1030
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:17,972
Why should I give it for free!

1031
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:23,909
Welcome all!

1032
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:27,295
Welcome, Please be seated!

1033
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:31,148
- So what you said?
- I told him to proceed if they are interested

1034
01:05:31,264 --> 01:05:35,404
How are you granny? Cute!

1035
01:05:38,118 --> 01:05:41,737
Hey, make it fast kid.
Lots of people to serve

1036
01:05:44,029 --> 01:05:45,029
Go and sit bro

1037
01:05:45,175 --> 01:05:46,175
- Son
- Yes mom?

1038
01:05:46,269 --> 01:05:50,175
No one from Groom's side has come yet?

1039
01:05:52,826 --> 01:05:58,034
They will come, might be
waiting for auspicious time

1040
01:06:04,612 --> 01:06:07,554
Give some space,
Thenmozhi

1041
01:06:09,139 --> 01:06:11,326
Some issue in my brother's house,

1042
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:14,217
So they want to stop this engagement.

1043
01:06:14,311 --> 01:06:16,248
What are you telling?

1044
01:06:16,821 --> 01:06:19,685
Mom, your brother family betrayed us!

1045
01:06:19,868 --> 01:06:22,309
They could have told us earlier,

1046
01:06:22,426 --> 01:06:25,310
We were humiliated in front of god's aisle!

1047
01:06:25,389 --> 01:06:29,529
This will never transcend to marriage!
bad luck.

1048
01:06:32,707 --> 01:06:36,170
- We shouldn't have done this dad
- We can't go against the will of my brother in law!

1049
01:07:03,054 --> 01:07:08,508
So Ayyanar, You are
getting smart these days!

1050
01:07:08,613 --> 01:07:12,362
You are planning to be the sole
heir of your uncle's properties

1051
01:07:12,493 --> 01:07:13,335
Not like that bro!

1052
01:07:13,366 --> 01:07:16,835
Why are you spinning
wheels, ask him directly.

1053
01:07:16,929 --> 01:07:21,424
You are bachelor and
your uncle has no heir,

1054
01:07:21,503 --> 01:07:25,982
What's the point in accumulating wealth?
so pls provide free side dish to customers

1055
01:07:26,061 --> 01:07:28,274
Dude, I'm already struggling
to finish my house,

1056
01:07:28,326 --> 01:07:32,562
Why do you struggle, finish off
your uncle and take over his house

1057
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:34,620
Does he need such big house at this age?

1058
01:07:34,672 --> 01:07:35,844
Don't talk ill about my uncle!

1059
01:07:35,948 --> 01:07:41,911
All I'm telling is that you are
rightful heir and please claim it!

1060
01:07:51,495 --> 01:07:52,771
Why are you sitting here Aunty?

1061
01:07:52,823 --> 01:07:55,635
I'm tired, just taking rest.

1062
01:07:55,766 --> 01:07:57,146
Come Aunty, I will drop you.

1063
01:07:57,207 --> 01:07:59,732
No issues, My son will
come and pick up soon

1064
01:07:59,785 --> 01:08:02,466
Why are you avoiding me?
Am I untouchable?

1065
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:04,237
Not like that!

1066
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:07,545
Why aren't you married yet?

1067
01:08:07,884 --> 01:08:11,920
I wish to, but no one's ready for alliance.

1068
01:08:15,539 --> 01:08:16,597
Have some food,

1069
01:08:16,682 --> 01:08:20,549
Aunty, I was casually asking your
daughter for marriage, please ignore

1070
01:08:20,633 --> 01:08:23,315
Why? Aren't you interested in my daughter?

1071
01:08:23,363 --> 01:08:27,920
Not like that Aunty, I'm no
match for her beauty and brain!

1072
01:08:28,005 --> 01:08:31,885
Only blessed soul will
be able to marry her,

1073
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:35,269
Do you know that your relative
spoiled this marriage?

1074
01:08:35,347 --> 01:08:36,347
What are you telling?

1075
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:40,920
Yes, one of your relatives spoiled this
marriage alliance, just be cautious.

1076
01:08:40,972 --> 01:08:42,862
Now you tell me, Will
you marry my daughter?

1077
01:08:43,878 --> 01:08:48,019
I have a very bad reputation here aunty,

1078
01:08:48,123 --> 01:08:53,180
I haven't tasted a drop despite running a
bar, even then no one is ready for alliance,

1079
01:08:53,235 --> 01:08:56,907
I keep running end to
end to meet the needs,

1080
01:08:57,082 --> 01:08:59,998
Shall I ask my son and
daughter's opinion once?

1081
01:09:00,026 --> 01:09:03,567
I'm fine with this alliance, but
I don’t think so they will agree,

1082
01:09:04,645 --> 01:09:10,009
Aunty, I'm so happy that you at least
considered a proposal, good bye.

1083
01:09:12,792 --> 01:09:17,765
What happened to you mom? I'm
planning for better prospects.

1084
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:19,612
When will that happen?

1085
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,045
Just wait for some more time,

1086
01:09:21,222 --> 01:09:22,602
I like him a lot.

1087
01:09:23,102 --> 01:09:27,477
I will get married on the same
date which was fixed earlier.

1088
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:31,935
Don't spill words in
anger, He's a fraudster

1089
01:09:31,988 --> 01:09:37,091
He's notorious guy and dangerous as well,

1090
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:40,659
Are you not interested to see my marriage?

1091
01:09:40,938 --> 01:09:43,203
His parents are not even talking
to each other for past 15 years

1092
01:09:43,368 --> 01:09:46,545
One house with two kitchens,
he's not even bothered about it,

1093
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:50,789
Who is the good guy here?
everybody got a mask

1094
01:09:52,201 --> 01:09:54,414
He doesn't hide his nature, that's all

1095
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:58,763
Just be patience, We have many relatives
and we will make good decision

1096
01:09:58,849 --> 01:10:01,322
The same relatives have
stopped this marriage,

1097
01:10:02,305 --> 01:10:06,576
Everybody likes me, but
no one will marry me

1098
01:10:07,253 --> 01:10:10,508
But, He's ready to marry
me, so please agree

1099
01:10:11,602 --> 01:10:13,243
Let me try to have a life

1100
01:10:15,102 --> 01:10:17,528
You don't trust me, right?

1101
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:19,154
Not like that brother,

1102
01:10:20,498 --> 01:10:23,255
Only you four will speak high about me,

1103
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,083
but the whole town is there
to criticise my birth

1104
01:10:28,102 --> 01:10:29,670
Will you swear on me,

1105
01:10:29,999 --> 01:10:31,952
that you will never mention
about marriage again?

1106
01:10:32,665 --> 01:10:34,633
Then I will live with you all forever,

1107
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:39,961
This continuous conversation about
marriage is killing me brother.

1108
01:10:48,889 --> 01:10:53,185
This will never transcend to marriage!
bad luck.

1109
01:10:55,477 --> 01:10:59,774
- Isn't she from your Family?
- Not by bloodline

1110
01:11:01,597 --> 01:11:04,461
Think about your birth, who will marry you?

1111
01:11:06,389 --> 01:11:10,242
Everybody likes me, but
no one will marry me

1112
01:11:12,925 --> 01:11:14,383
I like him a lot!

1113
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:47,117
I will share the womb

1114
01:11:47,248 --> 01:11:52,847
to be your brother, all the time

1115
01:11:53,029 --> 01:11:58,758
I will share the womb

1116
01:11:58,863 --> 01:12:05,201
to protect you like a Mother, all the time

1117
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:21,782
You are my inspiration

1118
01:12:21,884 --> 01:12:27,560
You gave me purpose in relationship

1119
01:12:27,691 --> 01:12:33,263
You showered me with kindness,

1120
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:38,576
and to see you always is a blessing.

1121
01:12:38,628 --> 01:12:44,206
You are my earth and sky

1122
01:12:44,519 --> 01:12:50,742
Your smile alone is
enough for me to survive

1123
01:12:50,987 --> 01:12:56,643
I will share the womb

1124
01:12:56,761 --> 01:13:02,292
to be your brother, all the time

1125
01:13:02,519 --> 01:13:08,190
I will share the womb

1126
01:13:08,339 --> 01:13:11,748
to protect you like a Mother, all the time

1127
01:13:11,773 --> 01:13:16,954
Brother, She would be expecting
us to do the honors

1128
01:13:17,632 --> 01:13:21,757
She was angry with us that day,
hope she'll realise our worth today

1129
01:13:22,137 --> 01:13:24,402
My brother's didn’t even come for honors

1130
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:27,501
They are going on family vacation

1131
01:13:27,658 --> 01:13:29,975
Why do they show their
grievance at this instance?

1132
01:13:30,106 --> 01:13:32,345
It's time, get the thali(nuptial chain)

1133
01:13:32,864 --> 01:13:34,598
Uncle, Please do the honors

1134
01:13:36,146 --> 01:13:37,544
Wait a minute Grandpa,

1135
01:13:39,744 --> 01:13:42,218
Uncle, you do the honors.

1136
01:14:31,946 --> 01:14:34,211
Congrats bro!

1137
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:37,024
- Happy married life, dear
- Show her the phone

1138
01:14:37,154 --> 01:14:40,033
- Tulasi, Happy married life
- Thanks brother!

1139
01:14:40,149 --> 01:14:41,149
Brother in law!

1140
01:14:47,936 --> 01:14:48,936
Do it proper!

1141
01:14:49,888 --> 01:14:51,632
Please stand this way!

1142
01:15:04,317 --> 01:15:05,317
Just  skin allergy,

1143
01:15:11,509 --> 01:15:14,024
Let me stand next to my brother in law

1144
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:19,097
Brother in law, please
take good care of Tulasi

1145
01:15:19,774 --> 01:15:23,784
Sure, but I heard that you and your
grandpa didn't approve this marriage

1146
01:15:24,227 --> 01:15:26,545
- Not like that..
- Is it?

1147
01:15:26,753 --> 01:15:31,024
You have no idea about my character

1148
01:15:32,665 --> 01:15:33,665
You will get to know,

1149
01:15:33,915 --> 01:15:35,547
Mom, Did everybody had food?

1150
01:15:35,795 --> 01:15:36,829
Tulasi dear, let's go for lunch

1151
01:15:40,873 --> 01:15:41,873
Come!

1152
01:15:57,591 --> 01:16:03,143
The groom was here till
lunch, he even served guests

1153
01:16:03,221 --> 01:16:08,012
The photographer asked him
to hug Tulasi for a photo...

1154
01:16:08,169 --> 01:16:13,299
...that made him angry and he
left and everyone's searching

1155
01:16:13,404 --> 01:16:15,330
Where could've he gone?

1156
01:16:15,459 --> 01:16:16,632
He's not in bar.

1157
01:16:16,817 --> 01:16:18,247
He's not in home,

1158
01:16:18,325 --> 01:16:20,122
Is he trying to con us?

1159
01:16:21,736 --> 01:16:23,117
Let us know if you
get any information

1160
01:16:24,476 --> 01:16:27,549
He's not like that bro,
you go an stay with mom

1161
01:16:27,654 --> 01:16:29,008
Don't worry Tulasi

1162
01:16:29,138 --> 01:16:30,882
God! give us peace!

1163
01:16:31,794 --> 01:16:34,632
- Hey Paramu, my wife is also missing!
- What?

1164
01:16:34,693 --> 01:16:37,375
- so?
- Did they elope?

1165
01:16:37,413 --> 01:16:38,975
What the hell!

1166
01:16:39,008 --> 01:16:40,335
Our son got dysentery

1167
01:16:40,391 --> 01:16:42,423
Oh no, She's here only!

1168
01:16:42,471 --> 01:16:46,403
Rascal! We know Ayyanar is
brainless, but not tasteless

1169
01:16:48,308 --> 01:16:51,167
The young star Prasanth is here!

1170
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,077
Hello Groom!!

1171
01:16:53,265 --> 01:16:54,309
Why didn't you invite
me for your marriage?

1172
01:16:54,361 --> 01:16:57,017
- Didn’t feel like inviting you!
- Oh, where are you going alone?

1173
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:58,215
I'm going abroad

1174
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:02,773
Ayyanar! you would be doing a
great favour to your wife!

1175
01:17:02,956 --> 01:17:06,080
- So, kindly go abroad and never come back!
- This is why I didn't invite you!

1176
01:17:06,133 --> 01:17:07,447
I know that you will never invite me,

1177
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:11,118
so I came in via backdoor for
lunch, The food was as bad as you!

1178
01:17:11,172 --> 01:17:13,773
- Shut up and get lost!
- Good bye!

1179
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,096
What is this?

1180
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:20,064
- Where were you?
- I went for a small walk

1181
01:17:20,143 --> 01:17:25,195
Then went to restroom, It was sweating
so had a shower and here I am refreshed.

1182
01:17:25,299 --> 01:17:27,929
The function is at 6:30 PM right?
We still have time, come on.

1183
01:17:30,356 --> 01:17:33,714
My blessings for long life!

1184
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:35,679
Come

1185
01:17:40,044 --> 01:17:42,361
You don't need to fall
on the feet of elders,

1186
01:17:42,507 --> 01:17:46,990
Even I don't like that. Our
blessings will always be with you.

1187
01:17:49,096 --> 01:17:53,809
- Hey Tulasi, no formalities please
- Why are you spoiling her gifts?

1188
01:17:55,043 --> 01:17:58,740
If you take your life serious,
then living will be easy

1189
01:17:58,862 --> 01:18:04,200
If you take your life easy, then
living will be serious, got it?

1190
01:18:05,294 --> 01:18:06,294
My blessings!

1191
01:18:09,054 --> 01:18:12,726
- What?
- Why your groom is so arrogant?

1192
01:18:13,013 --> 01:18:15,773
He needs more dowry, do
you want to lend some?

1193
01:18:15,851 --> 01:18:19,366
Why would I? Let him be
arrogant, it suits him.

1194
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:26,233
My blessings!

1195
01:18:35,305 --> 01:18:37,596
No. Take blessings
from elder brother.

1196
01:18:37,987 --> 01:18:40,877
No, it's fine Tulasi.

1197
01:18:41,815 --> 01:18:44,393
All our gods are with
you, my blessings

1198
01:18:44,862 --> 01:18:47,309
No Tulasi, No formalities!

1199
01:18:53,325 --> 01:19:01,189
Our Mom, brother and myself will
visit you often, so be happy

1200
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:05,069
Come, get blessings
from Uncle and Aunt.

1201
01:19:06,786 --> 01:19:08,238
Our Blessings Tulasi!

1202
01:19:08,551 --> 01:19:10,894
Insha-Allah, may god bless you!

1203
01:19:14,956 --> 01:19:22,742
Grandpa, elders, Uncle, Aunt,

1204
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:27,972
Please forgive me If I
had hurt anyone of you,

1205
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:33,140
I'm so blessed to have you all in my life.

1206
01:19:34,268 --> 01:19:35,268
Mother!

1207
01:19:37,799 --> 01:19:41,095
Even my mother wouldn't have
taken care of me so much,

1208
01:19:41,617 --> 01:19:45,093
I can't thank you
enough in this life!

1209
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:52,330
The pain and sacrifice
endured by my brother,

1210
01:20:05,544 --> 01:20:06,544
Let's leave Grandpa

1211
01:20:16,403 --> 01:20:18,903
I am seeing your father in you!

1212
01:20:19,373 --> 01:20:23,305
My son is not dead, he's living in you,

1213
01:21:33,022 --> 01:21:36,694
Wow, It's surprising to see
them taking the sport casually

1214
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,342
They both are thick
friends since childhood!

1215
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:44,667
They are doing business in the name
of sport, they are inviting trouble

1216
01:21:44,758 --> 01:21:48,091
He's the one who helps in my growth

1217
01:21:48,247 --> 01:21:51,529
He's the one who gives shoulder in trouble

1218
01:21:51,581 --> 01:21:55,044
When we come together, the
issues resolves itself.

1219
01:21:55,097 --> 01:21:57,414
He's my saviour!

1220
01:21:57,507 --> 01:22:03,887
Oh my friend! Oh my friend!

1221
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:10,763
He helps me to achieve my goals!

1222
01:22:10,972 --> 01:22:17,794
Oh my friend! Oh my friend!

1223
01:22:17,872 --> 01:22:24,418
He helps me to achieve my goals!

1224
01:22:25,934 --> 01:22:29,189
He's the one who helps in my growth

1225
01:22:29,398 --> 01:22:32,731
He's the one who gives shoulder in trouble

1226
01:22:32,809 --> 01:22:36,193
When we come together, the
issues resolves itself.

1227
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:38,434
He's my saviour!

1228
01:22:38,746 --> 01:22:45,204
Oh my friend! Oh my friend!

1229
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:52,273
He helps me to achieve my goals!

1230
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,663
The bull in the field

1231
01:22:56,767 --> 01:22:59,683
Never stops until it wins

1232
01:22:59,815 --> 01:23:05,804
He's the one, who accepts me as I am.

1233
01:23:05,846 --> 01:23:09,048
Dharma, your marriage is not accepted here,

1234
01:23:09,075 --> 01:23:10,950
Better alienate his family from the village

1235
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:14,792
Well, who needs your
support, get a life guys

1236
01:23:16,782 --> 01:23:23,750
Oh my friend! Oh my friend!

1237
01:23:23,882 --> 01:23:30,574
He's helps me to achieve my goals!

1238
01:23:30,809 --> 01:23:38,413
The words have no meaning
in front of  our friendship

1239
01:23:38,438 --> 01:23:45,130
Let's walk with out head held high
in pride and create new history

1240
01:23:57,625 --> 01:24:00,486
We are unbeatable!

1241
01:24:00,591 --> 01:24:01,591
Keep thinking that way!

1242
01:24:01,647 --> 01:24:05,124
- Careful what you ask for!
- What will you idiots offer?

1243
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:09,981
Guys, Please keep your fight off limits!

1244
01:24:10,596 --> 01:24:16,117
- Buddy, Don't lose control!
- Mate, I wont spare anyone!

1245
01:24:16,285 --> 01:24:18,343
Dharma, your life is in my hands now!

1246
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:32,420
Death or Marriage, they will go first and
leave last

1247
01:24:51,971 --> 01:24:58,533
Our relationship will
continue even beyond our time

1248
01:24:58,778 --> 01:25:05,720
It multiplies over the
time and never ceases

1249
01:25:06,788 --> 01:25:09,711
- Hey. boy or girl?
- It's a boy

1250
01:25:09,842 --> 01:25:12,393
Celebration everywhere!

1251
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:19,529
Everyday is new day for us

1252
01:25:19,686 --> 01:25:28,659
We never listened to idiots, and
never disrespected friends!

1253
01:25:28,764 --> 01:25:35,268
Oh my friend! Oh my friend!

1254
01:25:35,373 --> 01:25:42,169
He helps me to achieve my goals!

1255
01:25:42,352 --> 01:25:48,643
Oh my friend! Oh my friend!

1256
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:57,815
He helps me to achieve my goals!

1257
01:26:02,087 --> 01:26:03,675
Bose!

1258
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:13,147
Cover the exits!

1259
01:26:13,831 --> 01:26:14,831
No, Leave me,

1260
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,052
How dare you?

1261
01:26:18,644 --> 01:26:19,644
Die, you filth!

1262
01:26:25,799 --> 01:26:28,170
Brother, Somebody killed Dharma.

1263
01:26:28,223 --> 01:26:29,223
Where?

1264
01:26:34,762 --> 01:26:35,762
Dharma

1265
01:26:36,476 --> 01:26:37,986
My Friend!

1266
01:26:43,683 --> 01:26:45,063
Hey, get away!

1267
01:26:52,932 --> 01:26:53,932
Dharma

1268
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,563
Buddy, What happened?

1269
01:27:02,578 --> 01:27:07,239
Oh my Darma!

1270
01:27:07,423 --> 01:27:11,381
Dad!

1271
01:27:32,244 --> 01:27:34,691
Paramu, come, let's go

1272
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:39,664
How dare you enter the house, help me!

1273
01:27:39,744 --> 01:27:44,848
- Help me Please
- Hey, who are you?

1274
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:52,229
If I see you again here, I will kill you.
Get lost !

1275
01:27:52,512 --> 01:27:56,296
Why are you going?
Don't you have sense?

1276
01:28:07,494 --> 01:28:09,525
Please take this,

1277
01:28:11,192 --> 01:28:15,738
Also take this for monthly expense,

1278
01:28:17,978 --> 01:28:22,728
Bro, I heard you are
buying everything in pair

1279
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,876
Yes, He would have done
the same if I was dead

1280
01:28:25,192 --> 01:28:28,655
Don't pressurize kids, They will learn

1281
01:28:29,983 --> 01:28:31,545
Ok, you take rest.

1282
01:28:31,624 --> 01:28:36,535
Chandrabose starts visiting
her house regularly

1283
01:28:36,665 --> 01:28:38,488
Yeah, kick it

1284
01:28:48,853 --> 01:28:52,889
Dad, you should warn Bose. The whole village
is speaking ill about his relationship.

1285
01:28:53,107 --> 01:28:56,743
Even his wife is silent while
everyone in the village is noticing

1286
01:28:56,822 --> 01:28:59,884
If this continues, then
we will go separate ways

1287
01:29:00,691 --> 01:29:01,691
Is hot water ready?

1288
01:29:03,791 --> 01:29:06,525
Are you hearing enough from villagers?

1289
01:29:12,489 --> 01:29:14,022
Why are you doing this?

1290
01:29:16,681 --> 01:29:17,681
What!

1291
01:29:19,041 --> 01:29:24,509
I swear on this fire, there
is nothing physical about it.

1292
01:29:25,004 --> 01:29:30,915
Not just money, but giving time
is also considered as help

1293
01:29:31,983 --> 01:29:37,113
I really don't care what the
villagers think about us,

1294
01:29:37,139 --> 01:29:39,638
I only owe you people explanation!

1295
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:44,055
I know and I really don't
care about other's opinion

1296
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:48,533
- I was just asking whether you were aware about it?
- I know long before!

1297
01:29:48,769 --> 01:29:53,795
Why the hell you burnt so many
chillies to make that point!

1298
01:29:53,925 --> 01:29:57,362
- You have to look tidy all the time!
- Daddy

1299
01:29:59,915 --> 01:30:01,946
Lunch is ready Dad

1300
01:30:02,982 --> 01:30:04,981
Come dear! Tulasi!

1301
01:30:06,706 --> 01:30:08,971
- Did you had ?
- Yes

1302
01:30:09,101 --> 01:30:10,064
- What you had?
- Idly

1303
01:30:22,513 --> 01:30:25,689
The rat is spoiling the field

1304
01:30:25,836 --> 01:30:29,451
- Ask Arumpon to come to field
- Ok, sure.

1305
01:30:31,643 --> 01:30:36,695
- Esakki, shall we fence your field as well?
- Ok Dad

1306
01:30:38,076 --> 01:30:40,315
Give me that wire

1307
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:53,859
Take this and go, I will make connection

1308
01:30:55,187 --> 01:30:57,999
- Where is Arumpon?
- He will join soon Dad,

1309
01:31:04,224 --> 01:31:07,166
Where did he  go?

1310
01:31:07,479 --> 01:31:10,135
Hold it tight, Yes, Good!

1311
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:16,515
- Hold it tight and pull, then come here
- Ok Dad

1312
01:31:16,577 --> 01:31:17,644
Bro, Keep an eye!

1313
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:21,905
- Hit it, hit it hard
- Ok Dad

1314
01:31:21,932 --> 01:31:22,932
Let's go fast!

1315
01:31:33,614 --> 01:31:34,614
My son

1316
01:31:41,171 --> 01:31:47,837
Arumpon, Cut down the power, fast

1317
01:32:14,186 --> 01:32:16,555
Oh my God!

1318
01:32:26,815 --> 01:32:31,815
Cremate them first, else
there will be police case

1319
01:32:35,783 --> 01:32:40,919
- Let's cremate before Police barge in
- Get up my son, What will I do now?

1320
01:32:42,717 --> 01:32:45,830
We will all end up in jail.

1321
01:32:47,698 --> 01:32:52,101
No time for grievance!

1322
01:32:52,126 --> 01:32:56,571
We didn't inform anyone, we used the woods...

1323
01:32:56,674 --> 01:33:02,492
...and we cremated them overnight

1324
01:33:06,681 --> 01:33:07,681
Brother!

1325
01:33:09,824 --> 01:33:11,930
- Brother

1326
01:33:17,354 --> 01:33:18,354
Brother!

1327
01:33:20,206 --> 01:33:21,206
Brother!

1328
01:33:24,939 --> 01:33:29,815
Tulasi's mom passed away in
few months in depression

1329
01:33:29,881 --> 01:33:35,349
we are actually scared about
her future after her marriage.

1330
01:33:37,954 --> 01:33:42,585
I heard that too much of tears
spilled in yesterday's marriage

1331
01:33:42,695 --> 01:33:45,647
Even the actual parents wouldn't
have shed that much tears!

1332
01:33:45,935 --> 01:33:48,474
Sentimental episodes!

1333
01:33:49,778 --> 01:33:55,339
The whole town is spitting on
us that we skipped marriage

1334
01:33:55,513 --> 01:33:59,662
Yes, they mocked you a lot,
I'm not gonna spare him

1335
01:34:00,027 --> 01:34:01,615
- Forgive him dear,
- No way

1336
01:34:04,808 --> 01:34:06,639
It's of no use now.

1337
01:34:08,584 --> 01:34:12,099
I heard you were scolding us
for not attending the marriage

1338
01:34:12,132 --> 01:34:14,643
You didn't attend the marriage,

1339
01:34:14,675 --> 01:34:18,652
At least you could've apologized and
blessed my sister over the phone

1340
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:22,464
Is that how much you love me?

1341
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:25,563
Not only talking, even
thinking about you is love

1342
01:34:28,131 --> 01:34:30,995
- and then?
- I thought you will not talk to me!

1343
01:34:31,021 --> 01:34:33,390
I also had the same conviction,

1344
01:34:33,696 --> 01:34:37,315
But, this love is not only
selfless but also shameless

1345
01:34:37,428 --> 01:34:40,214
- What do you think about yourself?
- I think about you only

1346
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:45,552
- I will also show attitude
- Is it, give a try please!

1347
01:34:48,235 --> 01:34:51,401
- Whom do you think my father is to you?
- He's my father in law!

1348
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:53,381
- then my mom?
- She's my mother in law

1349
01:34:53,459 --> 01:34:55,230
Do you remember what all
my Mom did for you?

1350
01:34:55,282 --> 01:35:00,021
 lots of sweets and chicken meals!

1351
01:35:00,204 --> 01:35:05,304
I have organized feast for my sister,
come here and I will clear the debts!

1352
01:35:06,813 --> 01:35:12,521
- You have no idea about my upbringing
- Let's marry and I will see it myself

1353
01:35:13,344 --> 01:35:16,744
- I am so happy that you called,
- Same here

1354
01:35:17,072 --> 01:35:19,673
- we are also happy
- PK is also happy

1355
01:35:21,234 --> 01:35:23,499
So the big fool PK is also there?

1356
01:35:24,334 --> 01:35:27,667
- how do you know ?
- No one can laugh like him in this world!

1357
01:35:30,756 --> 01:35:34,918
- Hi Grandpa, aren't you sleeping?
- How can I?

1358
01:35:34,996 --> 01:35:40,856
She's educated that’s why
she's scolding him decent!

1359
01:35:41,273 --> 01:35:46,715
No one can make us happy
or sad like relatives

1360
01:35:48,534 --> 01:35:50,855
So, When is the feast
for relatives?

1361
01:35:52,132 --> 01:35:57,405
First let me treat
Tulasi and her husband!

1362
01:35:57,115 --> 01:35:58,692
Aunty, aren't you ready yet?

1363
01:36:01,115 --> 01:36:04,153
Uncle, There may be
thousand issues among you...

1364
01:36:04,255 --> 01:36:08,866
...As your daughter in law, I can never
allow this two kitchen system.

1365
01:36:09,178 --> 01:36:11,779
Get ready, we need to go my
brother's house for feast

1366
01:36:12,045 --> 01:36:13,201
- Son in law
- Aunty

1367
01:36:13,235 --> 01:36:14,953
Brothers!

1368
01:36:15,086 --> 01:36:16,257
- Shall we go?
- Yes, sure

1369
01:36:16,435 --> 01:36:19,618
Without hesitation you
have decided to marry me,

1370
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:23,954
So I want to take care of you better
than your mother and brother.

1371
01:36:24,068 --> 01:36:28,540
I know that, but not sure whether
you will match my brother.

1372
01:36:30,427 --> 01:36:32,505
- Brother
- Tulasi, Where are you?

1373
01:36:32,549 --> 01:36:35,517
- Just starting
- Fine, all others have arrived.

1374
01:36:35,671 --> 01:36:38,557
- Just one petition and you will get your pension
- Brother!

1375
01:36:38,714 --> 01:36:42,190
- Sorting few things, will come there soon
- Make it fast bro.

1376
01:36:43,965 --> 01:36:46,292
You are going the wrong way,

1377
01:36:46,448 --> 01:36:48,381
Do you want me to
come empty handed?

1378
01:36:48,714 --> 01:36:53,147
- Welcome Uncle, where's Tulasi and brother in law?
- They left home half hour earlier,

1379
01:36:54,266 --> 01:36:56,506
- Please take your seat
- Welcome! Welcome!

1380
01:36:57,325 --> 01:36:58,325
Welcome sir!

1381
01:36:58,869 --> 01:37:02,601
Tulasi, Get whatever you and your brother wants,

1382
01:37:02,643 --> 01:37:04,801
- Let me check, Arumpon,
- Yes Uncle

1383
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:07,621
Haven't you paid the interest yet?

1384
01:37:07,934 --> 01:37:11,058
- I will give today evening,
- Don't spoil my name son!

1385
01:37:16,483 --> 01:37:18,435
Why have you brought me here?

1386
01:37:18,516 --> 01:37:20,605
Even he's like your brother,

1387
01:37:21,605 --> 01:37:23,066
Is Arumpon your real brother?

1388
01:37:27,108 --> 01:37:29,177
These cellphones are big nuisance,

1389
01:37:29,336 --> 01:37:34,180
- Man, what a surprise?
- Yes mate, we came for the feast.

1390
01:37:34,234 --> 01:37:36,519
- Welcome, how are you Tulasi?
- Hey Kid, had any food?

1391
01:37:36,578 --> 01:37:38,355
- That's what he's made for
- Like a Lion!

1392
01:37:39,567 --> 01:37:41,207
-  Kid, Where's your dad?
- He'll come soon.

1393
01:37:41,284 --> 01:37:43,002
So Grandpa, Are you hungry?

1394
01:37:43,746 --> 01:37:48,629
- Yes, tell me?
- Your groom is in his friend's house ignoring your feast.

1395
01:37:48,752 --> 01:37:52,340
- Who told you?
- I have my source!

1396
01:37:53,337 --> 01:37:57,361
- Haven't they started yet?
- They started long back, might have stopped at temple.

1397
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,783
Did you invited your groom or not?

1398
01:38:00,681 --> 01:38:02,283
Why are you making us wait?

1399
01:38:08,015 --> 01:38:09,466
Dude, I'm hungry.

1400
01:38:09,525 --> 01:38:12,132
- Mani, ask everyone to have lunch
- Ok Dad.

1401
01:38:12,308 --> 01:38:13,714
Come let's have lunch

1402
01:38:13,739 --> 01:38:15,106
Don't get embarrassed.

1403
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,933
Guys, Lift it and tie

1404
01:38:19,551 --> 01:38:20,551
- Ok Brother
- Hold the chair

1405
01:38:20,714 --> 01:38:21,714
Tulasi

1406
01:38:24,730 --> 01:38:28,065
What? Why have you come long?

1407
01:38:28,261 --> 01:38:30,605
I think your husband is feeling
shy to come to our house

1408
01:38:30,664 --> 01:38:33,320
- He's neither shy...
- nor ashamed, am I right?

1409
01:38:33,374 --> 01:38:35,483
Ok, then you have it.

1410
01:38:35,948 --> 01:38:37,764
- Welcome Sister
- How are you all?

1411
01:38:37,862 --> 01:38:38,956
- We bought you lunch
- oh thank you.

1412
01:38:39,170 --> 01:38:40,499
- Where's brother in law?
- He's inside

1413
01:38:40,577 --> 01:38:42,999
Heard he went to his
Friend's house for feast

1414
01:38:46,499 --> 01:38:47,499
Brother in law!

1415
01:38:48,272 --> 01:38:50,928
- Brother in law!
- Oye Uncle!

1416
01:38:52,706 --> 01:38:54,190
I think he's sleeping

1417
01:38:54,225 --> 01:38:55,884
Glad you came this far.

1418
01:38:58,830 --> 01:39:02,013
See, This house is built
by my brother in law.

1419
01:39:02,291 --> 01:39:03,579
This is where Tulasi will live,

1420
01:39:03,659 --> 01:39:05,924
- Aunty, Welcome.
- Greetings, Son in law.

1421
01:39:05,983 --> 01:39:08,893
Hello Uncle, I know that
you were not sleeping

1422
01:39:09,451 --> 01:39:11,411
Have it son, Please.

1423
01:39:12,131 --> 01:39:14,983
I'm already full Aunty.

1424
01:39:17,095 --> 01:39:18,095
Hello Brother in law.

1425
01:39:19,649 --> 01:39:21,798
Tulasi, haven't
you fed them yet?

1426
01:39:21,917 --> 01:39:23,303
How long they will starve?

1427
01:39:30,702 --> 01:39:32,870
No dog responds to these callings, bro.

1428
01:39:33,553 --> 01:39:37,362
Puppy, Puppy, Puppy come here,

1429
01:39:37,538 --> 01:39:40,155
Come here, go to your boss.

1430
01:39:40,208 --> 01:39:41,909
This dog is updated uncle!

1431
01:39:43,036 --> 01:39:44,754
Do you want feast?

1432
01:39:46,923 --> 01:39:48,446
He wont eat all this boss.

1433
01:39:48,524 --> 01:39:51,629
Tulasi, ask your husband
to finish the house soon,

1434
01:39:51,688 --> 01:39:54,403
Let me know if he's running
short of cash, I'll organise

1435
01:39:56,962 --> 01:40:00,379
Tulasi, tomorrow we are going
to my uncle's house for feast

1436
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:04,025
- Looks like he takes eating a serious business
- Will you shut up kid?

1437
01:40:04,709 --> 01:40:08,869
Tulasi, the engine sound is not good,
I think it needs to be serviced

1438
01:40:09,143 --> 01:40:11,375
Mom, take your son to a good doctor.

1439
01:40:11,532 --> 01:40:12,766
Also add some salt in his food.

1440
01:40:14,182 --> 01:40:16,408
We are all consuming chemicals
in the name of salt

1441
01:40:16,506 --> 01:40:19,455
Only the raw salt is good for health.

1442
01:40:19,611 --> 01:40:22,341
So you take that Tulasi. Let's leave mom.

1443
01:40:22,731 --> 01:40:24,607
- Bye Aunty
- Bye Sister

1444
01:40:26,891 --> 01:40:29,138
Every mother feels this pain right?

1445
01:40:29,236 --> 01:40:31,560
Not all grooms are like this son,

1446
01:40:31,716 --> 01:40:35,993
- He didn't even welcome you
- He welcomed you, that's sufficient mom.

1447
01:40:38,493 --> 01:40:39,645
Take good care of him

1448
01:40:39,752 --> 01:40:41,603
Tulasi is there to take care of him

1449
01:40:52,107 --> 01:40:55,335
Then, What did your
brother in law told you?

1450
01:40:56,858 --> 01:41:00,002
He said he will give money
for the house construction.

1451
01:41:00,159 --> 01:41:04,413
He will give money today and
will take advantage tomorrow,

1452
01:41:04,623 --> 01:41:08,026
Should I lose my respect and
stand in the corner? or outside?

1453
01:41:08,125 --> 01:41:10,624
- Why are you talking like this?
- Then what are we here for?

1454
01:41:10,992 --> 01:41:14,039
Should you build house on his money?

1455
01:41:14,899 --> 01:41:18,453
I will organise Rs.5 Lakhs by selling
some gold, you finish the construction

1456
01:41:18,531 --> 01:41:20,513
Uncle, Already your situation is worse,

1457
01:41:20,545 --> 01:41:23,599
people are already asking to
refund for the land sales money!

1458
01:41:23,648 --> 01:41:26,050
The whole reason for this
fiasco is your brother in law

1459
01:41:28,325 --> 01:41:31,407
I don't have kids, you are my heir

1460
01:41:32,930 --> 01:41:35,742
If I'm saved, then I will
add your name in my will

1461
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:39,180
Else will sell everything
and settle the debt

1462
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:41,915
I will arrange for money,
start the construction.

1463
01:41:43,536 --> 01:41:45,079
Take this,

1464
01:41:45,704 --> 01:41:48,473
Finish the work in 2 months
for house warming ceremony

1465
01:41:48,962 --> 01:41:50,875
So you married for the
sake of your uncle?

1466
01:41:51,423 --> 01:41:54,196
- So it's all planned?
- No no, not like that.

1467
01:41:54,313 --> 01:41:58,278
You guys asked 'May I come
in?' and I said 'Ok Welcome'

1468
01:42:01,789 --> 01:42:05,016
I like you a lot, but I hate your brother.

1469
01:42:05,463 --> 01:42:09,560
- Why you don't like him?
- Yes, ask him why?

1470
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:13,427
Tell me how to sort this out.

1471
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:17,490
Is it? They incurred few
crores loss to my uncle,

1472
01:42:17,568 --> 01:42:19,825
Ask them to meet my
uncle and sort it out,

1473
01:42:19,881 --> 01:42:21,623
now stop talking about brothers.

1474
01:42:28,403 --> 01:42:30,137
Bad habit!

1475
01:42:30,541 --> 01:42:37,090
Earlier, people used to visit
and pay their respects,

1476
01:42:37,266 --> 01:42:40,566
but today, the same guys
are asking for the refund

1477
01:42:40,743 --> 01:42:44,649
Either I should run away or sell
this marriage hall to clear debts

1478
01:42:44,687 --> 01:42:47,108
If you withdraw the case,
It will be good for all

1479
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:51,381
That's not possible, please let
us know what else we can do?

1480
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:57,183
What's in it for you? I will give you a
share, so cooperate with me on this.

1481
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:02,025
Grandpa, were you hiding?

1482
01:43:02,125 --> 01:43:04,429
hey, who asked you to come here?

1483
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:06,865
So, everybody is inside only!

1484
01:43:06,949 --> 01:43:11,474
I told you clearly and you keep
repeating the same mistake

1485
01:43:11,513 --> 01:43:16,650
It was filed long back, but only
recently we got the judgement.

1486
01:43:16,963 --> 01:43:19,657
More than him, the buyers
are suffering a lot!

1487
01:43:20,088 --> 01:43:23,935
- It's all hard earned money son!
- Yes, I heard you too got 2 plots in it.

1488
01:43:23,993 --> 01:43:26,431
- Did you bought in Aunty name or someone else?
- Shut up idiot.

1489
01:43:26,783 --> 01:43:28,306
Ok fine, Fix it.

1490
01:43:28,423 --> 01:43:30,943
We can't, the judgement has been passed.

1491
01:43:31,117 --> 01:43:34,203
It's out of our hands uncle.

1492
01:43:34,459 --> 01:43:36,353
Tulasi got married to this
family, so tread careful

1493
01:43:38,297 --> 01:43:41,939
Her Husband, myself, we will
take care of her Uncle.

1494
01:43:43,241 --> 01:43:46,694
The guy who split lands into
pieces has never lived in peace

1495
01:43:47,007 --> 01:43:49,018
I'll take a small piece.

1496
01:43:52,289 --> 01:43:55,151
So, tell me now, what
should I do with them?

1497
01:43:55,738 --> 01:43:58,921
I will never interfere again,
you do whatever you want to do.

1498
01:44:04,886 --> 01:44:06,253
Keep the rest in account bro,

1499
01:44:06,995 --> 01:44:07,995
- See you brother
- Ok!

1500
01:44:10,814 --> 01:44:11,814
take care of this,

1501
01:44:13,262 --> 01:44:15,501
Tulasi,

1502
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:19,271
Why have you come suddenly in barefoot?

1503
01:44:19,521 --> 01:44:22,431
- What happened?
- Nothing mom.

1504
01:44:23,154 --> 01:44:25,360
I understood his true
purpose of this marriage,

1505
01:44:25,458 --> 01:44:28,485
He wants to avenge you
and make his uncle happy

1506
01:44:28,566 --> 01:44:30,142
I asked him why and he
threw the tumbler at me

1507
01:44:30,279 --> 01:44:32,524
- Then?
- His mom stopped him,

1508
01:44:32,549 --> 01:44:34,501
- Where is he now?
- Home

1509
01:44:34,732 --> 01:44:36,587
- come
- just leave it bro

1510
01:44:36,724 --> 01:44:38,520
Just come with me.

1511
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:41,274
What's up bro?

1512
01:44:41,305 --> 01:44:42,305
Arumpon leaving angry!

1513
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:43,676
- Bro,
- Paramu

1514
01:44:43,735 --> 01:44:46,778
Some issue in Tulasi house,
her husband slapped her,

1515
01:44:46,837 --> 01:44:49,493
- How dare he?
- Where are you going Dad?

1516
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:52,228
- I'm going for tussle
- I will also join you

1517
01:44:52,266 --> 01:44:54,140
Welcome my dear son, come let's go.

1518
01:44:54,277 --> 01:44:56,640
I'm not going to spare anyone today

1519
01:44:56,761 --> 01:44:59,844
- I'm customer bro
- I need extra hands

1520
01:45:01,888 --> 01:45:02,888
Hey Partner!

1521
01:45:06,693 --> 01:45:10,412
Ayyanar, Your wife has
brought her brother

1522
01:45:21,295 --> 01:45:23,732
Fast! Fast! Fast!
Here we come brother!

1523
01:45:23,771 --> 01:45:27,185
Aunty, when elders are here how
come you sent Tulasi away?

1524
01:45:27,498 --> 01:45:30,720
This is not fair, Tulasi, you go inside.

1525
01:45:30,974 --> 01:45:32,985
This should be the last time for
you to come alone to our house.

1526
01:45:33,010 --> 01:45:35,549
 Fast! Fast! Fast! drive safely!

1527
01:45:35,611 --> 01:45:38,219
Son! Lock the gate!

1528
01:45:38,298 --> 01:45:42,341
Tulasi, you shouldn't come to
our home for small grievances

1529
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:46,009
Also don't speak high
about us in this house!

1530
01:45:46,068 --> 01:45:47,786
like greatness of my mother and brother.

1531
01:45:47,826 --> 01:45:52,513
He's teaching them without lifting a stick!

1532
01:45:52,943 --> 01:45:55,774
face to face conversation
will solve all the problems,

1533
01:45:55,931 --> 01:45:58,587
But no one does that,

1534
01:45:58,974 --> 01:46:00,458
- Am I right uncle?
- Yes son!

1535
01:46:02,411 --> 01:46:04,774
- Come inside son
- some other time Aunty.

1536
01:46:06,063 --> 01:46:08,895
Sometimes life will be worse
than our expectation,

1537
01:46:09,345 --> 01:46:11,786
Sometimes it will be better
than our expectation

1538
01:46:12,119 --> 01:46:15,849
If you adjust and accept,
then things will be smooth

1539
01:46:16,685 --> 01:46:19,399
This advice is not only
for girls, for boys too

1540
01:46:19,654 --> 01:46:22,115
A suit is missing unlike Gopinath!

1541
01:46:22,232 --> 01:46:24,927
Brother in law, Please forgive Tulasi,

1542
01:46:25,338 --> 01:46:27,173
Whatever happened with your
uncle wasn’t intentional

1543
01:46:27,295 --> 01:46:29,267
Action block changed to emotional block!

1544
01:46:31,412 --> 01:46:34,806
His aiming is bad, better
hide the sticks guys!

1545
01:46:35,334 --> 01:46:39,826
Aunty, Treat Tulasi like your own daughter.

1546
01:46:42,853 --> 01:46:45,958
Get inside, bye Uncle, Bye Aunty.

1547
01:46:46,251 --> 01:46:48,448
Why is he aiming high?

1548
01:46:48,924 --> 01:46:56,560
- Driver start the vehicle, Don't shoot brother!
- Don't shoot uncle!

1549
01:47:00,486 --> 01:47:02,654
That's a life line for you,

1550
01:47:03,041 --> 01:47:06,829
Bro, you are in hunt and feast mode now,

1551
01:47:06,947 --> 01:47:10,345
But I'm not hungry, so some other time!

1552
01:47:13,251 --> 01:47:16,320
They force us to deliver punch dialogs!

1553
01:47:16,596 --> 01:47:20,150
I explained rationally,
hope things will be fine

1554
01:47:21,025 --> 01:47:23,661
Don't ask about this to
Tulasi, she might get upset

1555
01:47:23,721 --> 01:47:25,693
I'm not insensitive!

1556
01:47:27,275 --> 01:47:31,728
Ok, I'll take leave else will
spend the whole day watching you.

1557
01:47:33,525 --> 01:47:35,419
Why you keep starring at me?

1558
01:47:35,513 --> 01:47:39,048
Your father kills with the cough
and you kill me with the look!

1559
01:47:41,928 --> 01:47:46,021
- Yes Maangani?
- What happened, you guys were rushing fast?

1560
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:49,517
Is it? may be next time we will slow down!

1561
01:47:49,552 --> 01:47:53,008
Tulasi, your brother never
conceals anything from me

1562
01:47:53,185 --> 01:47:57,345
Your brother has suffered a
lot for you since childhood

1563
01:47:57,541 --> 01:47:59,122
You should understand that,

1564
01:47:59,357 --> 01:48:02,970
- There may be thousands of problems, but
- Ok Enough

1565
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,783
- I will take care of myself
- I'm talking for your wellness

1566
01:48:05,915 --> 01:48:09,177
Don't discuss about this with your brother,

1567
01:48:09,295 --> 01:48:12,419
I will also give a piece of
advice for your wellness,

1568
01:48:12,664 --> 01:48:17,790
I heard you were wasting time in
the name of collector dreams!

1569
01:48:18,064 --> 01:48:21,775
There is no such possibilities
in your horoscope.

1570
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:25,568
So better marry my brother
and settle down in life

1571
01:48:25,627 --> 01:48:29,553
- Hey,
- This is what your partners says about you!

1572
01:48:29,979 --> 01:48:36,091
Also, I agreed to this marriage so
that you both can get married soon

1573
01:48:38,045 --> 01:48:40,115
- Don't discuss this with my brother,
- OK! OK!

1574
01:48:45,930 --> 01:48:48,723
- Hello Partner?
- Won't I ever become collector?

1575
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:51,555
What? Why are you talking like this?

1576
01:48:51,614 --> 01:48:54,250
- What will happen to my dream?
- Don't pretend!

1577
01:48:54,421 --> 01:48:56,237
- I heard those were your words!
- What?

1578
01:48:56,395 --> 01:48:58,719
- Who told you this?
- Your sister!

1579
01:48:59,831 --> 01:49:04,049
Here she is, You stay in
line, don't utter a word!

1580
01:49:06,884 --> 01:49:09,266
- Tulasi
- I know that she's your girlfriend.

1581
01:49:09,407 --> 01:49:12,352
but why would you tell everything to her?

1582
01:49:12,449 --> 01:49:14,383
She's no match for me,

1583
01:49:14,964 --> 01:49:18,831
What non sense? Why are
you talking about me?

1584
01:49:18,890 --> 01:49:22,718
OH! So she's next to you, right?

1585
01:49:22,758 --> 01:49:28,343
Listen carefully, I can
spoil your dream in seconds

1586
01:49:28,363 --> 01:49:29,847
- You crazy
- Am I?

1587
01:49:30,647 --> 01:49:32,004
I will take care of you later.

1588
01:49:32,442 --> 01:49:35,731
What's your comment about
my collector dream?

1589
01:49:38,144 --> 01:49:41,308
- When did I told you Tulasi?
- Sometime back,

1590
01:49:41,425 --> 01:49:45,663
- Even Paramu bro was there,
- Got it, It was his comment!

1591
01:49:45,726 --> 01:49:49,236
- He said she can't even become compounder
- Wait! What?

1592
01:49:53,074 --> 01:49:54,441
Hello Collector madam!

1593
01:49:54,466 --> 01:49:57,727
- When are you going to..
- sign with green ink

1594
01:49:57,752 --> 01:49:59,353
But you said I wont become a collector!

1595
01:49:59,382 --> 01:50:01,901
- No, I never told that
- I heard you only told such thing

1596
01:50:01,961 --> 01:50:04,499
But I will benefit the most
if you become collector!

1597
01:50:04,539 --> 01:50:08,230
- but brother only told in a flow
- Bro, when did I told you that?

1598
01:50:08,315 --> 01:50:11,316
Oh you are with her, I
think Tulasi told that!

1599
01:50:11,414 --> 01:50:12,414
Brother!

1600
01:50:12,504 --> 01:50:17,776
Oh God! Whole family is on phone,
whom else should I blame it on.

1601
01:50:18,558 --> 01:50:22,464
First tell me who are all there
in the call, then let me confirm

1602
01:50:22,504 --> 01:50:27,523
Anybody can say anything,
but why would you say that?

1603
01:50:27,548 --> 01:50:29,868
Why dad? bye!

1604
01:50:29,938 --> 01:50:32,418
What a performance!

1605
01:50:32,443 --> 01:50:35,540
You flunked in the exams
and didn't inform me,

1606
01:50:35,641 --> 01:50:37,928
so out of anger, I told her like that,

1607
01:50:38,022 --> 01:50:40,295
but didn't expect her to
bring this topic to you,

1608
01:50:40,426 --> 01:50:42,106
You are way above all this dear,

1609
01:50:42,207 --> 01:50:43,960
But no one knows that level!

1610
01:50:44,899 --> 01:50:46,188
Get out!

1611
01:50:47,570 --> 01:50:51,648
Partner, I saved your
number as 'Maangani IAS'

1612
01:50:51,698 --> 01:50:52,698
Is it Bro?

1613
01:50:52,722 --> 01:50:54,596
You should always give
importance to me.

1614
01:50:55,570 --> 01:50:56,995
We are still in the call!

1615
01:50:57,031 --> 01:51:00,569
- Why are you eavesdropping?
- Ok, Good bye!

1616
01:51:00,686 --> 01:51:04,826
- This is too much!
- Ignore that cross talk!

1617
01:51:05,706 --> 01:51:08,889
- Where are you?
- I am in the milk farm only bro!

1618
01:51:08,968 --> 01:51:11,917
- Please allow me to talk!
- Ok, Good bye!

1619
01:51:11,975 --> 01:51:13,729
- Cut off
- Good respect!

1620
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:16,228
Shall I come there?

1621
01:51:19,739 --> 01:51:23,981
Hey Magnetic eyes, I will get
you minister post, rub it back

1622
01:51:30,397 --> 01:51:31,397
Rub it right!

1623
01:51:34,451 --> 01:51:35,451
The left!

1624
01:51:38,758 --> 01:51:42,385
Hey magnetic eyes, your
look gets me high mambo!

1625
01:51:42,410 --> 01:51:47,021
And lovely pearl beauty,
we will make good combo!

1626
01:51:48,987 --> 01:51:49,987
Right here!

1627
01:51:52,856 --> 01:51:53,883
Rub it back!

1628
01:51:54,089 --> 01:51:57,726
Hey magnetic eyes, you
win me over at ease

1629
01:51:57,809 --> 01:52:01,606
Hey handsome, give me a kiss!

1630
01:52:04,234 --> 01:52:05,234
Rub it right!

1631
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:08,690
The left!

1632
01:52:09,235 --> 01:52:12,802
I'm the leader of the Shy people's group

1633
01:52:13,062 --> 01:52:16,657
After I saw you, I quit that troupe

1634
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:20,485
I was without a follower
in the world of Twitter

1635
01:52:20,510 --> 01:52:23,927
After I followed you, I
became a trendsetter!

1636
01:52:24,294 --> 01:52:27,601
The single became sixer!

1637
01:52:42,653 --> 01:52:46,220
Hey magnetic eyes, your
look gets me high mambo!

1638
01:52:46,273 --> 01:52:50,387
And lovely pearl beauty,
we will make good combo!

1639
01:53:19,153 --> 01:53:20,153
All sexy girls!

1640
01:53:27,927 --> 01:53:31,171
Let's buy a piece of land
in moon and build a house

1641
01:53:31,196 --> 01:53:35,538
Let's live without any interference!

1642
01:53:35,563 --> 01:53:39,349
Let's get ten kids
and teach them Tamil

1643
01:53:39,374 --> 01:53:42,657
and listen to the stories
without disturbance

1644
01:53:42,736 --> 01:53:46,212
You are my cold Jigarthanda(sweet drink)

1645
01:53:46,342 --> 01:53:49,570
I will gulp it in jive

1646
01:53:49,828 --> 01:53:53,138
I know about you Dear,

1647
01:53:53,163 --> 01:53:57,799
I will never make you wait, I swear!

1648
01:53:57,824 --> 01:54:01,084
I was stumped over by your glam!

1649
01:54:01,108 --> 01:54:05,196
I was excited by your by your charm!

1650
01:54:20,212 --> 01:54:23,831
Hey magnetic eyes, your
look gets me high mambo!

1651
01:54:23,962 --> 01:54:27,425
Hey handsome, give me a kiss!

1652
01:54:30,123 --> 01:54:31,123
Rub it here!

1653
01:54:33,986 --> 01:54:34,986
Rub it back!

1654
01:54:35,147 --> 01:54:39,200
I'm the leader of the Shy people's group

1655
01:54:39,262 --> 01:54:42,725
After I saw you, I quit that troupe

1656
01:54:42,752 --> 01:54:46,605
I was without a follower
in the world of Twitter

1657
01:54:46,632 --> 01:54:50,147
After I followed you, I
became a trendsetter!

1658
01:54:50,213 --> 01:54:53,871
The single became sixer!

1659
01:55:16,112 --> 01:55:19,419
Oh my magnetic eye beauty!

1660
01:55:22,233 --> 01:55:24,915
If you are not inviting my brother for house
warming, then let's not invite anyone

1661
01:55:24,994 --> 01:55:27,545
You, me, your parents and
your uncle are sufficient.

1662
01:55:27,598 --> 01:55:31,972
It's all my hard earned money? Why
shouldn't I celebrate it grand?

1663
01:55:32,002 --> 01:55:34,108
Then invite my brothers as well,

1664
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:36,165
No, he's a bad omen for me.

1665
01:55:36,206 --> 01:55:41,101
This house was incomplete for more than four
years, your uncle didn't help at that time?

1666
01:55:41,207 --> 01:55:43,488
Only when my brother wants to
help, your uncle gave you money

1667
01:55:43,565 --> 01:55:47,513
My uncle built this house for his sister,
even you don't have any rights in this.

1668
01:55:47,539 --> 01:55:51,158
- What? I will invite my brother
- Yes, go ahead and do that,

1669
01:55:51,710 --> 01:55:55,949
If he comes for the function,
I will swear at him!

1670
01:55:57,353 --> 01:55:59,284
Don't mention about
your brothers again

1671
01:55:59,313 --> 01:56:00,656
Won't you guys support me?

1672
01:56:01,070 --> 01:56:04,246
- Hey, call your uncle.
- Call him

1673
01:56:06,901 --> 01:56:10,169
- Tell me son,
- It's me, your brother!

1674
01:56:10,198 --> 01:56:11,198
Tell me brother!

1675
01:56:11,292 --> 01:56:13,792
Did you got any invite for
Tulasi's house warming ceremony?

1676
01:56:13,817 --> 01:56:16,034
- Arumpon is here, asking us to come
- No brother,

1677
01:56:16,315 --> 01:56:18,036
They don't want us to come

1678
01:56:18,270 --> 01:56:21,733
He just want to insult Arumpon,

1679
01:56:22,021 --> 01:56:23,922
He invited the entire
neighbourhood except us!

1680
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:31,306
As if he has built a palace, I
don't give a damn about this.

1681
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:36,099
Just leave it bro, If I want to go then need to apply
leave with loss of pay, then need to spend on gift.

1682
01:56:36,308 --> 01:56:38,364
So it's better this way!

1683
01:56:38,615 --> 01:56:45,880
- Ok, inform our relatives not to attend the function then
- Sure brother, will inform everyone

1684
01:56:46,636 --> 01:56:49,031
Is Arumpon there?

1685
01:56:52,484 --> 01:56:54,254
You didn't pay interest yet to Arunachalam?

1686
01:56:54,333 --> 01:56:58,552
- I will pay after Housewarming ceremony
- Fast guys, he keeps calling me.

1687
01:56:59,583 --> 01:57:06,015
If we skip the function, then this will
become routine. We shouldn't leave our rights

1688
01:57:06,119 --> 01:57:07,119
Absolutely right!

1689
01:57:07,239 --> 01:57:10,624
So, you want us to get humiliated there?

1690
01:57:10,727 --> 01:57:12,471
Our relatives won't come,

1691
01:57:13,372 --> 01:57:16,640
Let's go and offer our respects
without anyone noticing

1692
01:57:16,781 --> 01:57:19,823
Why should we do that in secret?

1693
01:57:19,874 --> 01:57:24,796
No one will participate
against your uncle's words

1694
01:57:25,369 --> 01:57:29,510
Then let's take all our labours,
they are always there for us

1695
01:57:30,577 --> 01:57:34,692
- I'm also in
- You will be leading us Grandpa!

1696
01:57:38,831 --> 01:57:42,459
Great, Very good signs!

1697
01:57:42,576 --> 01:57:44,880
- Take care of everyone one
- Yes sure

1698
01:58:09,700 --> 01:58:11,028
The labours are
carrying the plates!

1699
01:58:12,576 --> 01:58:13,576
Welcome Brother!

1700
01:58:13,601 --> 01:58:16,120
- Welcome brother, mother
- How are you ?

1701
01:58:16,442 --> 01:58:18,278
Welcome grandpa, welcome all

1702
01:58:18,298 --> 01:58:23,645
- You said you didn't invite them
- I didn't, that shameless guy came on his own.

1703
01:58:25,683 --> 01:58:27,707
I will take care of him

1704
01:58:28,235 --> 01:58:29,993
Do whatever you want after I leave

1705
01:58:30,579 --> 01:58:32,864
Uncle, where are you leaving?

1706
01:58:32,923 --> 01:58:37,122
It's auspicious day and Pari agreed to
pay advance for the marriage hall sales

1707
01:58:39,396 --> 01:58:42,099
Tulasi, the house looks pleasant

1708
01:58:42,856 --> 01:58:44,734
I was not expecting you brother,

1709
01:58:44,970 --> 01:58:50,419
I didn't even have the courtesy of inviting
you, and on top I asked you not to come,

1710
01:58:51,528 --> 01:58:54,106
I don't need an invite for
your house function, sister!

1711
01:58:57,144 --> 01:58:58,813
Welcome all,welcome!

1712
01:58:59,263 --> 01:59:02,934
- Tulasi, give them milk
- I'm happy about the house.

1713
01:59:04,981 --> 01:59:09,879
Son, don't do it. Such an auspicious
day and don't want to see blood

1714
01:59:17,598 --> 01:59:19,097
Brother, Let's have food.

1715
01:59:19,274 --> 01:59:22,613
No, I'm already full with milk.

1716
01:59:22,731 --> 01:59:24,953
Organise a feast and
invite us, we will come.

1717
01:59:25,266 --> 01:59:26,711
Grandpa, have some food please.

1718
01:59:26,829 --> 01:59:31,633
No worries dear, take care.

1719
01:59:36,713 --> 01:59:38,801
Please ignore my husband's behaviour.

1720
01:59:41,473 --> 01:59:43,774
He may not like us,

1721
01:59:44,171 --> 01:59:45,962
but we will never ignore him,

1722
01:59:48,423 --> 01:59:51,569
Just be happy sister, bye.

1723
01:59:59,389 --> 02:00:03,789
Nobody can win a person
who is ready to lose.

1724
02:00:21,516 --> 02:00:23,599
He's upset, you better leave fast.

1725
02:00:23,624 --> 02:00:26,494
- Sorry bro, I coudn't come!
- That's fine bro.

1726
02:00:26,666 --> 02:00:29,315
- Why did you go there Grandpa?
- Why Uncle?

1727
02:00:29,919 --> 02:00:33,345
I told you not to go, what's the
point in attending the function?

1728
02:00:34,264 --> 02:00:37,349
Our survival is not based on your income,

1729
02:00:37,443 --> 02:00:40,861
If you want to stay here, you
better live by my rules!

1730
02:00:46,629 --> 02:00:49,162
- Aunty, Grandpa is leaving us,
- Let him leave,

1731
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:51,056
He likes Arumpon more
than us, let him go

1732
02:00:51,155 --> 02:00:55,310
- Grandpa, please forgive dad, stay back please
- No way

1733
02:00:56,151 --> 02:00:57,674
See how my Dad goes behind him,

1734
02:00:57,948 --> 02:01:01,092
They both have planned this.

1735
02:01:03,163 --> 02:01:07,048
- Wait until I send you away the same way!
- Ha, you are my legacy!

1736
02:01:09,619 --> 02:01:13,833
Brother! I never expected to buy your marriage hall!

1737
02:01:15,125 --> 02:01:16,896
Take care! Best wishes!

1738
02:01:18,208 --> 02:01:19,677
Good, alright!

1739
02:01:21,392 --> 02:01:23,306
Count this and store it.

1740
02:01:23,521 --> 02:01:27,720
- It will help in your marriage expense
- Leave it Grandpa!

1741
02:01:28,692 --> 02:01:31,114
What happened? Break-up?

1742
02:01:31,173 --> 02:01:35,255
Grandpa! no issues with Maangani, but
I doubt whether Uncle will agree.

1743
02:01:36,270 --> 02:01:39,103
- Hello
- Brother, Please don't tell anyone

1744
02:01:39,279 --> 02:01:41,563
Your brother in law slapped your
sister and she's unconscious now.

1745
02:01:41,676 --> 02:01:43,220
- What?
- True brother!

1746
02:01:43,254 --> 02:01:45,714
- They took her to hospital
- Which one?

1747
02:01:51,018 --> 02:01:54,347
- Patient name Tulasi, what's the room number?
- one second sir!

1748
02:01:56,313 --> 02:02:00,011
- She's not here
- Sorry bro, She's admitted in Janaki hospital

1749
02:02:00,495 --> 02:02:02,623
- Tell me the truth!
- I swear bro!

1750
02:02:07,921 --> 02:02:09,811
What you did to Tulasi?

1751
02:02:09,967 --> 02:02:10,967
Did you roam a lot?

1752
02:02:14,336 --> 02:02:17,189
Congratulations, You will soon be an uncle!

1753
02:02:18,187 --> 02:02:21,641
Brother, I just thought of calling you now,

1754
02:02:21,666 --> 02:02:23,262
I only asked my guys to call him,

1755
02:02:23,287 --> 02:02:25,332
- Oh is it!
- I'm so happy Tulasi

1756
02:02:25,644 --> 02:02:27,186
My blessings

1757
02:02:27,325 --> 02:02:31,172
Your responsibility is doubled now!

1758
02:02:31,524 --> 02:02:34,489
I told my Uncle and he told me
this is not right time for baby

1759
02:02:34,528 --> 02:02:37,535
Brother, what were you
both discussing about?

1760
02:02:37,595 --> 02:02:42,164
We were just discussing about the baby

1761
02:02:42,946 --> 02:02:47,306
- So when are you going to get married
- Hopefully soon.

1762
02:02:51,938 --> 02:02:53,593
Congrats

1763
02:02:53,692 --> 02:02:55,000
wish you the same!

1764
02:02:55,114 --> 02:02:57,711
It took time to escape my father's fort

1765
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:01,619
You are already late!

1766
02:03:02,145 --> 02:03:04,214
- Don't get irritated if a girl comes late
- is it?

1767
02:03:04,255 --> 02:03:09,020
- At the same time, don't make her wait, got it?
- Yes sure!

1768
02:03:09,410 --> 02:03:12,555
- You should like my arrogance
- Ok, then,

1769
02:03:12,653 --> 02:03:16,672
- You should convince your mother if she's not happy about me
- OK

1770
02:03:17,062 --> 02:03:22,922
- If we go for shopping, you shouldn't let me pay
- Don't worry, I wouldn't let you go for shopping

1771
02:03:22,964 --> 02:03:25,925
- You shouldn't complain about my lipstick
- I wont

1772
02:03:25,987 --> 02:03:29,287
Good, you shouldn't see the 'last
seen' status and argue with me

1773
02:03:29,933 --> 02:03:32,409
Ok, also won't ask anything even
if you turn off 'last seen'

1774
02:03:32,526 --> 02:03:33,854
- Correct!
- Good lord!

1775
02:03:33,932 --> 02:03:37,447
You shouldn't feel shy to carry
my handbag when going out

1776
02:03:37,686 --> 02:03:39,655
I'm already doing that, Ok!

1777
02:03:39,725 --> 02:03:43,874
- Don't force me to call your friends as 'brother'
- Ok!

1778
02:03:43,942 --> 02:03:46,849
- You will love all my friends
- Double Ok!

1779
02:03:46,909 --> 02:03:47,909
- What?
- I mean!

1780
02:03:48,325 --> 02:03:49,408
What did I tell you?

1781
02:03:49,486 --> 02:03:54,037
- Hey, will you agree for everything?
- Yes, I will

1782
02:03:54,126 --> 02:03:56,313
Don't worry, All the best for your exams!

1783
02:03:56,391 --> 02:03:59,730
I believe you will pass the exams!

1784
02:03:59,927 --> 02:04:04,438
If the marriage will distrub
your vision, then I will wait.

1785
02:04:04,576 --> 02:04:08,696
I want to become Collector,
and then marry you

1786
02:04:08,829 --> 02:04:11,250
We owe that much to Tulasi.

1787
02:04:12,129 --> 02:04:14,062
She endured all this for us!

1788
02:04:20,792 --> 02:04:22,306
I will buy it for you,

1789
02:04:22,643 --> 02:04:24,322
- Aunty
- Tulasi

1790
02:04:24,401 --> 02:04:25,905
- Yes brother
- What happened?

1791
02:04:26,003 --> 02:04:30,104
- Nothing brother, I'm not feeling well
- What happened?

1792
02:04:45,561 --> 02:04:47,768
- What happened sister?
- Nothing brother

1793
02:04:47,865 --> 02:04:49,173
Then why are looking sad?

1794
02:04:50,678 --> 02:04:52,631
I can't be happy like you,

1795
02:04:52,749 --> 02:04:57,826
I had to laugh, cry, stare,
sleep without any complaints,

1796
02:04:58,003 --> 02:04:59,252
because I'm woman!

1797
02:04:59,292 --> 02:05:02,412
We treat woman as god,
tell me what happened?

1798
02:05:03,350 --> 02:05:06,572
- Why is your face swollen?
- Just mind your business brother!

1799
02:05:06,767 --> 02:05:10,361
I just conceal everything
and exist here,

1800
02:05:11,065 --> 02:05:14,639
You warned me about this
guy, but I ignored you!

1801
02:05:14,678 --> 02:05:17,783
Just stop it, What the hell happened Aunty?

1802
02:05:17,916 --> 02:05:19,888
- I mean...
- Just tell us

1803
02:05:22,292 --> 02:05:24,908
- Who are you guys?
- We need three whiskey bottles

1804
02:05:24,964 --> 02:05:28,326
- Why are you asking it here?
- We bought from here several time,

1805
02:05:28,402 --> 02:05:33,033
- The shop opens at 12 noon only, but they sell here
- What's this Aunty?

1806
02:05:33,580 --> 02:05:35,939
If I see you guys again,
I will thrash you all.

1807
02:05:35,998 --> 02:05:38,517
Hey, You cheapsters
shouldn't show any pride!

1808
02:05:38,751 --> 02:05:40,216
Let's get it from springhead!

1809
02:05:40,801 --> 02:05:43,908
What's happenning here?
Where's the stock aunty?

1810
02:05:46,946 --> 02:05:47,946
What is this?

1811
02:05:51,769 --> 02:05:53,986
Sir, Please spare the lady!

1812
02:05:54,090 --> 02:05:57,214
She's pregnant, please spare her,

1813
02:05:57,254 --> 02:05:58,581
Please Sir, spare her

1814
02:05:58,601 --> 02:06:01,511
Dear, Please forgive me,
Please give it to me

1815
02:06:03,367 --> 02:06:06,394
My brother warned me for this only.
Aren't you ashamed of this work?

1816
02:06:06,746 --> 02:06:09,124
Aren't you ashamed
of your birth!

1817
02:06:09,223 --> 02:06:12,796
- Be careful, If you speak ill about my birth
- Shut up!

1818
02:06:14,896 --> 02:06:18,246
Do you think she got no one to look after?

1819
02:06:33,404 --> 02:06:34,075
COME!

1820
02:06:43,303 --> 02:06:47,404
I keep forgiving you but you are
taking too much of advantage

1821
02:06:51,024 --> 02:06:52,024
COME!

1822
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:05,112
It's 12:01 noon and why
isn't the shop opened yet?

1823
02:07:05,170 --> 02:07:06,479
Redecorating the shop!

1824
02:07:06,557 --> 02:07:08,100
Can't you do that later?

1825
02:07:08,236 --> 02:07:12,455
How dare you slap a pregnant lady?

1826
02:07:12,651 --> 02:07:13,651
Hey, Stop it!

1827
02:07:13,822 --> 02:07:16,556
I asked my sister to be patience but
not at the cost of self respect

1828
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:22,260
- You humiliate everyone, shall I do the same now?
- Hey, leave me alone!

1829
02:07:22,312 --> 02:07:24,006
- Shall I?
- Don't do it!

1830
02:07:25,646 --> 02:07:28,302
I spare you for the
sake of my sister

1831
02:07:34,561 --> 02:07:37,529
So, What's your
plan for revenge?

1832
02:07:39,730 --> 02:07:43,798
I think he'll pass
away before planning!

1833
02:07:44,398 --> 02:07:45,745
Looks like Pilot car!

1834
02:07:46,913 --> 02:07:47,913
huh, this guy!

1835
02:07:48,874 --> 02:07:50,808
Why is he with gang?

1836
02:07:56,463 --> 02:07:59,563
Welcome Pari bro, you
came to console him?

1837
02:08:00,418 --> 02:08:01,418
Please take your seat!

1838
02:08:02,059 --> 02:08:04,408
- Why are you drinking?
- Nothing

1839
02:08:05,326 --> 02:08:09,076
This is the first time he's drinking
in his life, so just imagine the pain!

1840
02:08:09,794 --> 02:08:11,439
- Bad timing mate
- Sorry bro!

1841
02:08:11,479 --> 02:08:14,525
He's already humiliated
by his brother in law,

1842
02:08:14,628 --> 02:08:16,088
and you are provoking him,

1843
02:08:16,245 --> 02:08:20,874
Not just humiliation, he has
totally spoiled his reputation

1844
02:08:22,529 --> 02:08:26,283
Why are you shouting at him?
He's just brutally honest.

1845
02:08:27,163 --> 02:08:28,803
Just don't piss me off, get out.

1846
02:08:28,842 --> 02:08:33,608
- Why are you showing you anger at an innocent?
- Who is innocent?

1847
02:08:33,662 --> 02:08:34,662
Roaring lion!

1848
02:08:34,717 --> 02:08:38,388
I came here with gang to
thrash your brother in law.

1849
02:08:38,447 --> 02:08:40,127
- Come let's go
- Not needed, get lost

1850
02:08:40,497 --> 02:08:44,580
Not needed? hey, Look here mate!

1851
02:08:44,940 --> 02:08:50,188
Hey Your Uncle can't clear debts and
wrote off all the wealth in my name

1852
02:08:50,321 --> 02:08:51,321
and you are asking me to get lost?

1853
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:53,921
So, you came here to insult me?

1854
02:08:54,232 --> 02:08:55,890
Just get out guys!

1855
02:08:55,984 --> 02:08:57,273
Whom are you asking to leave?

1856
02:08:57,371 --> 02:09:03,837
You don't have courage to thrash your
brother in law but you keep shouting at me!

1857
02:09:03,973 --> 02:09:06,414
Can you touch me and leave
this bar in a piece?

1858
02:09:06,571 --> 02:09:10,965
This is my place and my
bar, you get out now!

1859
02:09:17,410 --> 02:09:20,515
Brother, Pari Brother!

1860
02:09:21,587 --> 02:09:26,119
Hey, he's bleeding guys!

1861
02:09:26,341 --> 02:09:28,411
he's not breathing

1862
02:09:29,817 --> 02:09:33,743
Hey Pari, get up, get up.

1863
02:09:33,776 --> 02:09:35,503
You killed our brother!

1864
02:09:38,429 --> 02:09:39,672
That was not intentional,

1865
02:09:41,170 --> 02:09:43,014
We will not spare you!

1866
02:09:43,077 --> 02:09:44,077
Kill him now!

1867
02:09:44,585 --> 02:09:45,585
Leave me,

1868
02:09:48,140 --> 02:09:49,764
Don't let the murderer escape!

1869
02:09:51,448 --> 02:09:53,971
Ayyanar Killed Pari, Let's go guys!

1870
02:09:54,074 --> 02:09:55,074
We shouldn't spare him!

1871
02:09:57,199 --> 02:09:58,199
STOP!

1872
02:10:00,801 --> 02:10:01,801
STOP!

1873
02:10:02,873 --> 02:10:04,392
- Yes, tell me
- A small issue Uncle

1874
02:10:04,472 --> 02:10:06,815
- I slapped Pari and he is dead
- What?!?

1875
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:09,926
But why the hell are
you calling me?

1876
02:10:10,283 --> 02:10:13,111
Go and surrender at Police station.

1877
02:10:13,145 --> 02:10:13,902
Uncle!

1878
02:10:18,261 --> 02:10:21,575
Tulasi, Pari is dead, I
didn't kill him intentionally

1879
02:10:21,616 --> 02:10:22,983
- What?
- Yes Tulasi.

1880
02:10:24,271 --> 02:10:29,755
He shouldn't reach Police
station, go for the kill.

1881
02:10:31,924 --> 02:10:33,994
Oh my god, It's your dad!

1882
02:10:34,019 --> 02:10:39,052
Brother, They are all united
to kill your brother in law

1883
02:10:39,077 --> 02:10:40,092
What are you telling?

1884
02:10:40,205 --> 02:10:43,701
Lift him guys!

1885
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:49,060
Don't leave him,

1886
02:10:52,732 --> 02:10:53,732
Search him

1887
02:10:54,966 --> 02:10:55,966
He's not here

1888
02:10:57,286 --> 02:11:00,474
- Brother in law, you there?

1889
02:11:02,322 --> 02:11:05,680
- Where are you?
- I'm near your field only.

1890
02:11:05,751 --> 02:11:08,938
- All my sins are chasing me
- Make your way into the grove

1891
02:11:08,976 --> 02:11:10,921
Hey, I found him!

1892
02:11:11,189 --> 02:11:12,189
Fast guys,

1893
02:11:14,461 --> 02:11:15,461
Run fast guys!

1894
02:11:21,210 --> 02:11:22,210
Catch him!

1895
02:11:26,758 --> 02:11:27,758
Don't leave him

1896
02:12:08,362 --> 02:12:10,400
Cover the exits guys!

1897
02:12:12,307 --> 02:12:14,944
Let's discuss about this first

1898
02:12:15,061 --> 02:12:17,697
We will discuss over his dead body!

1899
02:12:17,913 --> 02:12:21,545
I will hand over my brother
in law at Police station,

1900
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:23,299
You can handover his dead body!

1901
02:12:23,417 --> 02:12:24,417
Please spare him!

1902
02:13:03,253 --> 02:13:04,253
Stab him!

1903
02:13:58,647 --> 02:14:01,174
Brother! Husband!

1904
02:14:02,866 --> 02:14:04,499
Brother! Brother!

1905
02:14:06,002 --> 02:14:07,569
Brother, What's happenning here?

1906
02:14:07,642 --> 02:14:12,040
- You both leave
- How will you tackle alone?

1907
02:14:12,087 --> 02:14:14,985
Come, let's go.

1908
02:14:18,100 --> 02:14:19,795
He's trying to escape, catch him

1909
02:14:20,218 --> 02:14:22,256
Catch him guys!

1910
02:14:53,486 --> 02:14:56,079
Oh god! No!

1911
02:15:12,793 --> 02:15:13,793
No..wait

1912
02:15:14,660 --> 02:15:16,722
I swear I'm not responsible for this!

1913
02:15:24,935 --> 02:15:25,935
My respects!

1914
02:15:27,376 --> 02:15:29,799
We should kill them both.

1915
02:15:30,432 --> 02:15:33,307
Brother, you will not
go alone to the grave

1916
02:15:33,354 --> 02:15:37,307
- We will send him with you
- Let's go and take his life

1917
02:15:42,135 --> 02:15:44,275
Come on guys

1918
02:15:44,791 --> 02:15:45,791
Don't miss a spot,

1919
02:15:52,537 --> 02:15:54,285
- Whose in the house?
- We will kill him here,

1920
02:15:56,374 --> 02:15:57,295
Where's your grandson?

1921
02:15:57,858 --> 02:16:00,203
He should be hiding inside, bring him out.

1922
02:16:01,918 --> 02:16:04,460
Stop! Stop! Open the door!

1923
02:16:05,769 --> 02:16:09,983
Search everywhere, spare none.

1924
02:16:10,075 --> 02:16:11,703
Where is he?

1925
02:16:12,621 --> 02:16:15,433
I will kill your grandson before
I send off my brother in law.

1926
02:16:18,215 --> 02:16:19,945
- Who are you?
- Get lost

1927
02:16:22,286 --> 02:16:23,286
Hey, Stop you guys!

1928
02:16:23,362 --> 02:16:24,905
Where's Arumpon?

1929
02:16:25,023 --> 02:16:27,034
Why are you disturbing us?

1930
02:16:27,129 --> 02:16:29,277
- Show your anger at him
- I want him here

1931
02:16:29,414 --> 02:16:31,601
Shut up, Pari is related to us as well,

1932
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:34,335
He's not here, If you see
him do whatever you want

1933
02:16:34,390 --> 02:16:37,772
I swear that I will kill him first
and then cremate my brother in law

1934
02:16:37,812 --> 02:16:41,444
- Keep your rowdyism outside, now get out
- I swear I will kill him.

1935
02:16:41,776 --> 02:16:42,963
Where is he?

1936
02:17:02,037 --> 02:17:06,349
Brother, Pari's men came
home searching for you

1937
02:17:06,447 --> 02:17:10,490
They hit Anbu in the
commotion, you stay alert

1938
02:17:10,812 --> 02:17:12,560
All are with you only right?

1939
02:17:13,088 --> 02:17:14,689
Take care of them.

1940
02:17:57,043 --> 02:17:59,048
Is it still paining?

1941
02:17:59,384 --> 02:18:02,938
Don't worry, the pain will reduce

1942
02:18:05,010 --> 02:18:08,231
Uncle, one thug broke my head.

1943
02:18:08,642 --> 02:18:11,961
You came here to see
whether we are alive?

1944
02:18:12,949 --> 02:18:16,607
Shut up, Do you have any idea how much trouble we are in?

1945
02:18:17,865 --> 02:18:18,865
Get out!

1946
02:18:19,692 --> 02:18:21,391
- Get out!
- Dad!

1947
02:18:22,392 --> 02:18:23,392
You carry on

1948
02:18:23,779 --> 02:18:28,348
Your dad did the same
thing and he died soon

1949
02:18:28,395 --> 02:18:30,575
Brother, he's our younger one.

1950
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:33,168
He will also have the same fate!

1951
02:18:33,555 --> 02:18:35,858
If you don't behave yourself,
you will be gone soon

1952
02:18:36,897 --> 02:18:40,076
I never crossed limits, I
always consult with you all

1953
02:18:40,140 --> 02:18:43,300
So you never disobeyed us?
You always do the opposite!

1954
02:18:43,417 --> 02:18:45,077
Is this how you respect us?

1955
02:18:45,650 --> 02:18:50,141
Since the day her parents entered
our house, we have issues

1956
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:51,627
and now she's the trouble maker

1957
02:18:51,715 --> 02:18:54,302
I told your mother to
leave her in orphanage,

1958
02:18:54,361 --> 02:18:56,294
- Your mom never listened to us
- Brother, please don't be harsh

1959
02:18:57,999 --> 02:19:03,464
Son, you better leave, the whole village
is waiting to see our family split

1960
02:19:04,044 --> 02:19:08,073
What are you staring at? I will slap you!

1961
02:19:08,171 --> 02:19:12,096
- Son, you are crossing your limits.
- I don't think so?

1962
02:19:12,546 --> 02:19:17,643
He's the one stands in front for
all the festivals and ceremonies,

1963
02:19:18,732 --> 02:19:21,350
Are you competing with me?

1964
02:19:23,596 --> 02:19:25,315
You will never change!

1965
02:19:28,606 --> 02:19:30,516
How can I compete with you Uncle?

1966
02:19:31,042 --> 02:19:35,925
You are much ahead of us
after my father's death

1967
02:19:36,706 --> 02:19:41,178
I'm nobody, I couldn't even
perform last rites for my father

1968
02:19:41,846 --> 02:19:48,406
I believed that I will remember
my father through you all

1969
02:19:49,010 --> 02:19:53,092
But have you ever treated
me fair atleast once?

1970
02:19:53,664 --> 02:19:55,357
You won't even step into my house,

1971
02:19:56,256 --> 02:20:00,181
I asked for a financial help, but he's
collecting interest through third person

1972
02:20:00,357 --> 02:20:02,524
I didn't feel offended,

1973
02:20:02,912 --> 02:20:04,686
But now I realise that,

1974
02:20:04,757 --> 02:20:09,858
you all were treating us like
orphans and not relatives

1975
02:20:12,310 --> 02:20:15,099
I like my uncles a lot,

1976
02:20:16,056 --> 02:20:20,837
But, even they were not ready
to accept marriage proposals

1977
02:20:23,578 --> 02:20:27,907
You too, We never did anything
without your knowledge

1978
02:20:28,346 --> 02:20:30,505
But you did a lot without our knowledge,

1979
02:20:31,272 --> 02:20:33,376
Including, stopping Tulasi's marriage.

1980
02:20:34,217 --> 02:20:36,872
Had you agreed for the marriage,

1981
02:20:38,275 --> 02:20:40,657
We wouldn't be running like this,

1982
02:20:43,642 --> 02:20:47,544
You will never understand our pain,
your father is still alive

1983
02:20:49,895 --> 02:20:52,474
But, for me,

1984
02:20:53,353 --> 02:20:54,818
I lost my father,

1985
02:20:55,315 --> 02:20:57,472
and she lost everyone.

1986
02:20:58,653 --> 02:21:01,635
I promised that I will
take care of her,

1987
02:21:01,683 --> 02:21:04,159
Do you want me to quit on her?

1988
02:21:05,776 --> 02:21:10,655
Not only Tulasi, I would be
doing the same for anyone here

1989
02:21:13,312 --> 02:21:15,561
Are we there to only
share happiness?

1990
02:21:19,185 --> 02:21:23,599
Only our grandfather looked
at us like relatives

1991
02:21:25,608 --> 02:21:31,196
My mom is very cautious in our upbringing,

1992
02:21:31,373 --> 02:21:34,185
and we try hard to live
upto her expectation

1993
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:41,915
We don't expect your sympathy, but
atleast don't add more pain to us

1994
02:21:42,092 --> 02:21:45,021
We will be able to survive on our own

1995
02:21:48,811 --> 02:21:52,596
There's no point in competing with you,

1996
02:21:54,119 --> 02:21:56,541
You keep going in the front as usual,

1997
02:21:57,069 --> 02:21:59,295
We will just happily follow you,

1998
02:21:59,666 --> 02:22:02,166
However you insult us,

1999
02:22:02,908 --> 02:22:07,576
We keep roaming around
to earn your affection

2000
02:22:12,838 --> 02:22:16,746
I'm sorry If I had insulted you

2001
02:22:19,075 --> 02:22:21,531
Kid, I'm sorry.

2002
02:22:24,253 --> 02:22:28,914
I will take care of this problem

2003
02:22:30,274 --> 02:22:33,278
I will solve this issue on my own

2004
02:22:38,871 --> 02:22:39,871
Don't cry,

2005
02:22:40,251 --> 02:22:45,680
I really can't see you crying,
Please don't lose hope

2006
02:22:47,008 --> 02:22:48,413
Don't mind all this.

2007
02:22:52,713 --> 02:22:54,288
I will also come with you Uncle

2008
02:22:55,617 --> 02:22:58,996
Not this time my dear Kid.

2009
02:23:14,910 --> 02:23:19,085
Brother, Arumpon is at our
temple gates with his family

2010
02:23:19,206 --> 02:23:21,588
- What are you telling?
- True brother!

2011
02:23:21,605 --> 02:23:24,378
Get ready guys, We will kill him today.

2012
02:23:41,051 --> 02:23:43,826
Hey, you saved your brother in law...

2013
02:23:43,919 --> 02:23:47,301
...and entered our village
without any fear?

2014
02:23:47,372 --> 02:23:51,044
- You have spoiled my sister's life
- I will kill you all now!

2015
02:23:51,145 --> 02:23:52,403
Let's see who will save you.

2016
02:23:52,543 --> 02:23:55,582
I beg you all, please don't beat him

2017
02:23:58,472 --> 02:24:02,579
- Hey, Stop it guys-
I wont spare anyone, Leave me guys

2018
02:24:02,797 --> 02:24:05,612
They have surrendered themselves
in front of our panchayat...

2019
02:24:05,729 --> 02:24:08,337
Let him explain first

2020
02:24:08,362 --> 02:24:09,362
Yes, proceed

2021
02:24:13,455 --> 02:24:14,455
Let's listen to them first!

2022
02:24:16,734 --> 02:24:18,733
What my brother in law did is stupidity

2023
02:24:19,465 --> 02:24:22,273
I saved him so that
no other life is lost

2024
02:24:23,428 --> 02:24:24,753
I know the value of life

2025
02:24:25,925 --> 02:24:27,937
I understand that family's pain

2026
02:24:30,106 --> 02:24:33,754
Please tell us what we
need to do for redemption

2027
02:24:33,837 --> 02:24:36,800
Your brother in law didn't kill him

2028
02:24:37,132 --> 02:24:38,694
This guy killed him

2029
02:24:39,730 --> 02:24:41,937
He will surrender and confess to Police

2030
02:24:42,835 --> 02:24:44,886
Your brother in law confessed for money

2031
02:24:44,984 --> 02:24:49,418
My whole village will support that
your brother in law is innocent

2032
02:24:49,531 --> 02:24:51,484
So, you bring your brother in law outside

2033
02:24:51,524 --> 02:24:53,769
I will chop him to pieces

2034
02:24:54,955 --> 02:24:55,955
I will kill him

2035
02:24:56,035 --> 02:24:58,496
We will live peacefully
after seeing his blood

2036
02:24:58,650 --> 02:25:03,261
Is it fair to have
an eye for an eye?

2037
02:25:04,629 --> 02:25:08,023
Look at her, she's pregnant

2038
02:25:08,492 --> 02:25:10,835
Do you want her to face the
same fate like your sister?

2039
02:25:10,893 --> 02:25:15,425
I don't care about your daughter's life

2040
02:25:15,484 --> 02:25:17,535
Ask me anything apart from
my brother in law's life

2041
02:25:17,594 --> 02:25:18,594
What do you mean?

2042
02:25:19,703 --> 02:25:21,265
You want to settle this with money?

2043
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:24,777
Are you showcasing your richness?
I want him only

2044
02:25:24,855 --> 02:25:27,296
and nobody leaves until he come here.

2045
02:25:27,395 --> 02:25:32,902
No one from your village can enter here,
Let's wait for your brother in law

2046
02:25:35,658 --> 02:25:39,679
I came here and kneel down in front
of you doesn't mean that I 'm scared

2047
02:25:40,430 --> 02:25:43,121
If I'm scared, I would be alone

2048
02:25:43,357 --> 02:25:45,993
You have no idea If I
stand up in this issue

2049
02:25:46,599 --> 02:25:50,642
It wont take more than couple of minutes
to thrash you all and walk away

2050
02:25:50,701 --> 02:25:53,122
Hey, how dare you,

2051
02:26:06,795 --> 02:26:08,958
They are the affected, so I didn't hit back

2052
02:26:09,525 --> 02:26:11,185
Others don't have that advantage

2053
02:26:11,733 --> 02:26:12,733
I'm not here for fight

2054
02:26:17,665 --> 02:26:21,063
I know the pain of my sister

2055
02:26:21,845 --> 02:26:24,364
and also can understand
the pain of their family

2056
02:26:26,125 --> 02:26:27,934
I have seen my mom in the same situation,

2057
02:26:28,814 --> 02:26:30,942
I have experienced that kid's emotion

2058
02:26:32,489 --> 02:26:35,255
I know the pain of widowed mother

2059
02:26:36,455 --> 02:26:38,302
I have experienced all this things

2060
02:26:41,107 --> 02:26:44,532
My mom always address me as saami(god)

2061
02:26:45,126 --> 02:26:47,626
but she's the real god

2062
02:26:48,055 --> 02:26:50,926
She faced all troubles and brought us up

2063
02:26:51,356 --> 02:26:54,462
the only reason she's kneeling
down in front of you all is,

2064
02:26:54,579 --> 02:26:58,153
the respect we pay for the affected family

2065
02:26:59,540 --> 02:27:01,684
Please understand that,

2066
02:27:01,724 --> 02:27:03,911
How dare he can hit us!

2067
02:27:07,437 --> 02:27:08,624
Don't you guys get it?

2068
02:27:09,146 --> 02:27:12,753
I don't want to lose another
life in the name of revenge

2069
02:27:14,190 --> 02:27:16,212
No one have rights to kill

2070
02:27:16,818 --> 02:27:20,118
and not necessarily a lost life
is compensated with another life

2071
02:27:21,193 --> 02:27:22,193
Mom, get up.

2072
02:27:22,619 --> 02:27:23,619
Tulasi, get up.

2073
02:27:29,580 --> 02:27:33,600
I know it's this is wrong time to ask this,

2074
02:27:37,403 --> 02:27:42,047
But If you wish, I will marry
you and accept your kids

2075
02:27:43,043 --> 02:27:44,043
Brother!

2076
02:27:45,290 --> 02:27:48,981
Not immediately, take your time

2077
02:27:55,226 --> 02:27:56,637
Thank you.

2078
02:27:57,698 --> 02:27:59,944
You are a big hearted.

2079
02:28:01,698 --> 02:28:05,627
Why should I punish you for
someone else's mistake

2080
02:28:07,714 --> 02:28:12,326
His fate ended in this way

2081
02:28:14,159 --> 02:28:16,225
His time has come, that's it.

2082
02:28:16,519 --> 02:28:19,898
There's no point in holding grudges

2083
02:28:21,173 --> 02:28:25,719
My husband and myself blessed
this girl for happy life

2084
02:28:27,164 --> 02:28:29,292
I can't spoil her life!

2085
02:28:32,148 --> 02:28:36,540
I request our people to
send them away with respect

2086
02:28:36,755 --> 02:28:42,669
That's enough for me and my
husband will truly rest in peace

2087
02:28:50,470 --> 02:28:51,470
Sister

2088
02:28:52,123 --> 02:28:55,286
- Oh my dear
- Please get up

2089
02:28:57,083 --> 02:28:58,083
Please get up

2090
02:29:15,028 --> 02:29:16,942
You have lots of
relatives in our village

2091
02:29:17,987 --> 02:29:19,566
You are always welcome there.

2092
02:29:20,590 --> 02:29:22,425
I will come and meet you often

2093
02:29:23,153 --> 02:29:24,153
is it fine?

2094
02:29:33,319 --> 02:29:34,319
Goodbye Son!

2095
02:29:51,403 --> 02:29:54,707
You have raised above
your father today!

2096
02:29:59,407 --> 02:30:01,438
You are making me owe more

2097
02:30:13,651 --> 02:30:15,500
- Uncle, it's Maangani's baby showering
- What?

2098
02:30:15,562 --> 02:30:18,531
I mean, Tulasi's baby showering,
brother in law also coming in parole

2099
02:30:18,559 --> 02:30:21,586
Thought of doing it big, need some money

2100
02:30:22,504 --> 02:30:25,491
Can you please organise some
funds through your friend?

2101
02:30:25,526 --> 02:30:28,695
- Why ? I will give you son
- I will pay back the interest promptly.

2102
02:30:28,728 --> 02:30:30,609
- welcome son
- Hello aunty

2103
02:30:30,687 --> 02:30:32,464
It's our house function son,

2104
02:30:33,265 --> 02:30:34,843
careful sister,

2105
02:30:35,755 --> 02:30:39,745
- So Maangani, when will you become collector?
- Soon bro.

2106
02:30:42,166 --> 02:30:44,842
I will take you to a good
doctor after marriage

2107
02:30:44,941 --> 02:30:46,854
- Son in law
- Yes Uncle?

2108
02:30:47,069 --> 02:30:49,729
- No party?
- No pocket!

2109
02:30:49,823 --> 02:30:53,866
The kid is crying, will you shut up please!

2110
02:30:56,268 --> 02:30:57,268
Shall we conclude?

2111
02:30:57,675 --> 02:30:59,964
A FILM BY PANDIRAJ!

2112
02:31:01,034 --> 02:31:06,680
I will share the womb

2113
02:31:06,704 --> 02:31:12,304
to be your brother, all the time

2114
02:31:12,328 --> 02:31:18,057
I will share the womb

2115
02:31:18,081 --> 02:31:24,419
to protect you like a Mother, all the time
