1
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,179
This tale began with the birth of a mentally challenged bay, Rohit.

2
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,450
As years went by, his physical growth continued unhindered...

3
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,782
but his mental age- remained that of a child.

4
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,214
The way he spoke, his habits, everything...

5
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,559
But he had to pay a price for his innocence.

6
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,357
Everyone makes fun of me.

7
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,469
If you don't help me, then who will?

8
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,429
You are so powerful.

9
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:48,602
Please God, please can you give me a little bit of your power?

10
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:53,746
And, one night, a space-ship landed in Kasauli.

11
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,717
Rohlt found Jaadu...

12
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,516
and his life turned into bliss.

13
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,519
Jaadu blessed Rohlt with amazing powers...

14
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,490
...and that transformed him completely.

15
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,362
Rohit's fame spread far and wide.

16
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,729
One clay he received a special invitation...

17
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,265
...to visit Singapore for some research.

18
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,234
The invitation was sent by the famous Dr. Siddhant Arya.

19
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,670
Mr. Rohit Mehra, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

20
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,399
Unfortunately Sonia Mehra lost both her...

21
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,274
son Rohlt and daughter-in-law Nisha forever...

22
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:24,544
and her grandson Krishna became her reason to live-.

23
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:30,251
But, she was so scared by Krishna's baffling super powers that

24
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,381
she took him away to a remote and unknown location.

25
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,351
But Destiny chose the path of love...

26
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,484
Krishna followed his love, Priya, to Singapore...

27
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:42,424
where he learnt the shocking truth that...

28
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,524
his father Dr. Rohit Mehra was alive.

29
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,372
And was being held captive by Dr. Siddhant Arya since many years.

30
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,233
Time saw Krishna create a new history.

31
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,009
With a broken piece of a mask-..

32
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,974
...that he donned in the midst of a circus fire.

33
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,714
And, this led to the birth of..-...

34
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,910
a protector, a friend, a superhero

35
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,643
<i>Krrish!</i>

36
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,040
Kaal's experiment ls a success.

37
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,913
Now, this virus--.

38
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,748
Will mark the beginning...

39
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,044
of the end of humanity.

40
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,484
Thank you, Jaadu.

41
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:02,430
I have now understood your secret of harnessing the power of sunlight.

42
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,965
If this experiment is successful.--...

43
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,066
It will usher in a new beginning...

44
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,733
for this world, for all mankind.

45
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,508
Just 10 more minutes.

46
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,514
Papa? What happened?

47
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,819
Is everything alright?

48
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:29,757
Of course.

49
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:30,623
I am also fine!

50
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:31,660
And everything is also fine!

51
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,728
in fact, l am so excited that...

52
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,730
Papa?

53
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,525
Oh <i>,</i> sorry for waking you up.

54
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,694
But, It's just 9 minutes to sunrise.

55
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,100
Come on, you have to come up to the lab.

56
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,036
Come on! 
- Yes, papa.

57
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,606
<i>('Imam!</i>

58
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,006
It should all work today!

59
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,036
I have tweaked the formation to perfection.

60
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,480
My calculations should not go wrong today.

61
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,560
Wow, papa!

62
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,751
What's all this?

63
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,191
My years of hardwork...

64
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:10,993
and endeavour.

65
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,570
Because life originates in light.

66
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,631
Light gives life-.

67
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,605
And, I think I have finally...

68
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,542
managed to create the perfect combination...

69
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:22,678
to multiply the energy of light...

70
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,270
by using mirrors to reflect it.

71
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,212
This magical combination is naturally present in nature.

72
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,553
But, unfortunately we cannot see it.

73
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:34,548
Hence, I have invented this pen...

74
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,620
which is actually an electronic device.

75
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,289
Whenever it's in the presence of such a combination...

76
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,866
It gets activated and starts beeping...

77
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:48,201
And then, It consolidates and multlplies...

78
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,972
all the light beams and concentrates it on a subject.

79
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:53,805
And, manifests the life giving properties of light.

80
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,905
You mean, the rays of the sun will...

81
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,640
revive this dead plant?

82
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,312
What?

83
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,050
But that's Impossible!

84
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,432
What do you mean?

85
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,668
Of course it's possible!

86
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,881
It will, lam certain.

87
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,583
Fingers crossed, cross them!

88
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,562
Papa, the sun...

89
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,073
The pen has been activated.

90
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,052
This means... the placement of all the mirrors is correct.

91
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,746
The formation ls absolutely right.

92
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,780
The power of the energy ls far too much.

93
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,749
I have ta think of something.

94
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,346
I must do something.

95
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,189
Perhaps, we need to build a filter...

96
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,817
that passes just the right amount of radiance...

97
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,192
and absorbs the rest of the energy.

98
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:27,764
You mean...

99
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,163
..a filter with a brain, papa?

100
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,930
Correct
- A filter with a brain!

101
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:38,907
Easy, I wlll build It.

102
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,041
And then you'll see.

103
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,475
This experiment will change face of solar energy-.

104
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,157
What are you staring at?

105
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:48,138
Don't you have work today?

106
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,246
Corrie on, time to go to office!

107
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,456
A filter with a brain.

108
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,953
Easy, I'll do It.

109
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,254
Krishna!

110
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,764
Ready, Papa-

111
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,369
Hmm... smart you're looking.

112
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:15,471
Thank you.

113
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,942
Did you fix the tyre that someone pu nctu red yesterday?

114
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:19,876
Yeah, no...

115
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,144
the thing is-..

116
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,116
Where the hell is Priya'?

117
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,209
Priya!

118
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,778
I am coming!

119
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,358
Ready, Papa-

120
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,822
<i>Sure.</i>

121
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,223
Get dressed, first.

122
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,387
I am ready.

123
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,792
Are you sure?

124
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,788
I was only touching up...

125
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:36,890
I will finish it up in the car.

126
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,533
Puncture!

127
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,508
Look.

128
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,950
Yeah.

129
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,786
Wow I

130
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,257
Now you look perfectly ready!

131
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,350
I am also ready.

132
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,298
Okay, since we are all ready, let's go paint the town red-.

133
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,030
Red?

134
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,432
Don't you have to go work at the TV channel today?

135
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,502
I have to.

136
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,205
But, after a quick visit to the parlour.

137
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:22,939
Alright Krishna.

138
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,105
Your office ls here.

139
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,113
Oh, actually my new office ls a little ahead.

140
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,242
If you take the next right...

141
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,342
tthen again the right after the first left--.

142
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,444
You will reach the security agency, that's my new office.

143
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,090
Even the Air india job?

144
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,853
Hurry up! I am getting late!

145
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,390
Don't change the topic.

146
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,589
What happened this time?

147
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:43,992
I know what happened.

148
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,066
What?

149
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,034
When the clients must be coming to book their air tickets.-.

150
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,605
He must have been in the air!

151
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:49,999
Hence, the airline authorities must have...

152
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,369
permanently grounded him.

153
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,601
And told him to take off for good.

154
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:54,469
Correct?

155
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,272
Right. Papa-

156
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,345
That is exactly what happened.

157
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:57,913
Very good.

158
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,307
I'm proud of you.

159
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,842
That's it. Right there- Step.

160
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,281
This is my new office.

161
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:04,944
You work at SIS?

162
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,888
Oh husband, come here.

163
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,555
Yes, wife?

164
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,494
I am going to leave the studio at 4:30 pm.

165
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,331
You have to meet me at 5:00 pm sharp.

166
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,162
I hope you haven't forgotten.

167
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,061
Yes .

168
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,064
If you are late again, Mr. Mehra...

169
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,004
maybe you'll get fired from being a husband too...

170
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,376
I know. Bye.

171
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,002
Bye.

172
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,575
Alright, papa-

173
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,280
Where should I drop you off?

174
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,383
What do you mean?

175
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,280
I haven't been sacked, yet.

176
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,179
Drop me off at the lab as always.

177
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,159
We shall overcome...

178
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,257
We shall overcome...

179
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,661
Krishna...
Kripal--. you both have been fired.

180
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,399
Here's your termination letter...

181
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,202
and here's you rs.

182
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:09,646
What's wrong?

183
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,621
Shrunk from a football to a tennis ball?

184
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,390
Yesterday, when those four robbers broke into the jewellery store..-

185
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,491
you disappeared!

186
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,090
Are you really surprised they fired you?

187
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,025
But, you also?

188
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,603
Well, even Iran.

189
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,298
But I ran away, so I could come back.

190
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,633
What do you mean?

191
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,670
I mean...

192
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,344
what are you all staring at?

193
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,276
We have been sacked...

194
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,972
but you still have jobs to do.

195
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,516
Get going. 
- Okay.

196
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,084
You don't understand.

197
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,646
Yesterday, after I ran off.

198
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,014
I mean, left...

199
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,051
who entered the store?

200
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:51,484
Who?

201
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,653
Who entered?

202
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:53,395
<i>Krrish!</i>

203
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,259
Correct!

204
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,661
Understood the secret?

205
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,138
What's my full name'?

206
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,509
Kripal Sharma.

207
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,375
Yes, take the Kri of Kripal.

208
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,140
Kri.

209
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,214
And the Sh of Shanna.

210
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:12,611
Sh.

211
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,082
Put them together, what do you get?

212
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,049
<i>Krrish .</i>

213
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:16,645
You?

214
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:20,453
Not so loud.

215
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,184
If anyone hears, a crowd will gather.

216
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,261
People will ask for autographs, you know what I mean...

217
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,056
You still think I am wrong-.

218
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,098
Right?

219
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,366
Height!

220
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,194
<i>Krrish is quite ta“.</i>

221
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,999
And you are...

222
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,697
One has to adjust things, my friend.

223
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,032
Tall, when a fight is an.

224
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,441
But I like to be small on duty.

225
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:41,670
Never mind, you won't get it-.

226
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,479
That's the style of us supermen.

227
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,148
And, you are a mere common man.

228
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:49,242
Go ahead and find a job that you might be good at.

229
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,183
Correct?

230
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,117
Breaking news from Mumbai.

231
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,189
The front landing gear of flight AKA 101...

232
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,261
coming in from Delhi to Mumbai ls jammed.

233
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,388
All the attempts of the pilot to extend It have been futile.

234
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:06,468
Failure to lock down the landing gear can cause a crash landing.

235
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,663
This can prove fatal to all the passengers...

236
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,071
...and the crew present in the aircraft.

237
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,448
See? 
Duty calls.

238
00:17:12,474 --> 00:17:13,126
I must go.

239
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,363
'And, we'll keep updating you about it, time to time.'

240
00:17:15,389 --> 00:17:16,136
- Where did he go?

241
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,283
Mumbai Control. AKA 101...

242
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,284
waiting for instructions.

243
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,252
AKA 101

244
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:29,525
we have cleared runway 2-7 for emergency landing...

245
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,128
you are cleared to land.

246
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,127
Best of Luck.

247
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,698
Sir, landing without an extended nose landing gear...

248
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,532
can cause the plane to skid...

249
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,725
It can even explode.

250
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,634
We don't have any other option.

251
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,070
We have run out of fuel.

252
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,407
We have to take this chance.

253
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,644
Pay Attention, please keep your seat belts fastened...

254
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,680
and take brace position for landing.

255
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,077
What did he say?

256
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,211
What's happening?

257
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,342
Looks like something is really wrong.

258
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,608
What's going on?

259
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,858
Mom, we are going ta be- fine?

260
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:17,202
God, Please help us. Please...

261
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,678
<i>Bravo, Krrish .</i>

262
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,321
Super job, Krrlsh.

263
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,595
We have safely landed.

264
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:39,405
<i>Krrish!</i>

265
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,876
<i>Look mum, Krrish! -
 What'? Where'!?</i>

266
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:52,447
An epidemic of an unknown virus has broken out in Namibia-.

267
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,649
Disturbing images of the virus outbreak have..-...

268
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,420
"Just come in from the city of Gebabis.

269
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,382
Our correspondent ls currently at the local office...

270
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,043
...of the international Health Council...

271
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,888
waiting for a statement from Dr. Varun Shetty...

272
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,389
...Regional Director of the WHO.

273
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,923
On my return from Namibia this morning...

274
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,554
I have Immediately briefed senior members of the IHC...

275
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,894
about the current state of this outbreak.

276
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:40,494
This virus needs to be contained as soon as possible.

277
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:44,573
Otherwise the consequences would be,
would be catastrophic.

278
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,533
infected samples of blood have
been dispatched to distinguished...

279
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,578
scientists and doctors
in all parts of the world.

280
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,846
We need,
we need all the help possible...

281
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,575
...in coming out with an antidote.

282
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:58,110
It is now quite clear that
the Namibia crisis is escalating.

283
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,515
Our channel has set
up a toll free emergency...

284

...help line for any
virus related information-.

285
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,055
Hello, Yes, Dr. Shetty?

286
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,494
Dr. Mehra, lam sure you must have...

287
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,566
heard about the
life threatening virus...

288
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,534
that is creating panic in Namibia-.

289
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,432
Yes, we just saw It on TV...

290
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:17,497
Dr. Shetty, how long does It take- fer
the symptoms of this virus to show?

291
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,576
What ls the incubation period?

292
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,812
People start exhibiting
the symptoms within...

293
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,673
...5 seconds to 5 minutes of contact.

294
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,150
This virus is spreading
rapidly through air and water-.

295
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,447
We have sent the
blood samples of the...

296
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,888
...lnfected people
to several labs worldwide.

297
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,185
You will receive It too.

298
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,754
And, I am really hopeful that...

299
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,959
you will be successful
in coming up with a solution.

300
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,961
That's why,
you are my last hope, Dr. Mehra.

301
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,430
Please, do something.

302
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:47,059
I will give it my all, Dr Shetty-

303
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:54,807
Hello.

304
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,570
Hello, Dr. Shetty?

305
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:57,870
Yes, who's this?

306
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:03,484
Hello sir, this is Alok Sen-
Dr. Alok Sen.

307
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,749
Sir, I have to meet you right: now.

308
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,853
It's very urgent sir. Please, sir-.

309
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:08,890
Regarding what?

310
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,084
Sir...

311
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,923
I have some shocking
information about...

312
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,964
the virus outbreak in
Namibia and its antidote.

313
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,030
What!

314
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,862
I will tell you everything
when we meet, sir-.

315
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,927
That's why I am calling from
a pay phone, sir- Please, sir.

316
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,595
Okay... calm down, Dr. Sen.

317
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,535
I am heading to my office.
Why don't you come there?

318
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,575
The address ls...

319
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,509
Yes, sir- I know where it: is,
I'll be there soon.

320
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,913
Good evening, sir.

321
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:36,849
Good evening.

322
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:37,886
I am expecting someone.

323
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,114
Okay, sir. - Thanks-.

324
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,027
Who are you?

325
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:52,157
Unique, Unusual, Unparalleled.

326
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,263
Because, I have no history...

327
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,234
no past.

328
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,837
Just the present.

329
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,268
Surprlsed?

330
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,873
Whoever you are, you have
clearly come to the wrong place.

331
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:07,175
The place is also right,
and so is the time.

332
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,811
The same can't be said
about my intentions though...

333
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,910
What nonsense! Please leave!

334
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,824
At least get to know me flrst.

335
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,222
I am the answer
to all your questions.

336
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,898
- Look... - You look...

337
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:26,692
into my eyes -. .

338
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:28,600
To find yourself.

339
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,607
What the hell do
you think you are doing?

340
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,704
Sir, there ls a Dr.
Sen here to see you...

341
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,709
Send him in.

342
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:11,746
Right, sir.

343
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,117
Dr. Shetty? I'm Dr. Sen.

344
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:19,579
Thank you for meeting me.

345
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,884
You said you wanted to tell
me something about the virus?

346
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,155
Yes, sir- Here...

347
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:31,891
This contains a sample of the virus,
and it's antidote.

348
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,031
I work for Kaal Pharmaceuticals.

349
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:40,033
This company experiments
with the fusion of DNA--.

350
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:43,908
Of different species to
create antidotes for viruses.

351
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:45,704
But sir.-.

352
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,708
I recently discovered that...

353
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,049
before they can formulate
the antidote, they create the virus.

354
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,250
They have laboratories
all over the world.

355
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,726
Sir, I've collected
all evidence against them...

356
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,161
...and saved it in this pen drive.

357
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:09,795
You were assigned
charge of Lab no. 3.

358
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:16,876
Where you had to put together
the DNA of various species...

359
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,274
but instead you put
together these files?

360
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,346
How do you know?

361
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,017
I know!

362
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:43,298
You've made a grave
mistake by cheating him.

363
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,097
He can't stand traitors.

364
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,925
This is Kaya-.

365
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,693
A miracle of science.

366
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,765
Created by the one,
who ls creating...

367
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,772
his own, new and
extraordinary world on Earth.

368
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,414
This is Kaal.

369
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:30,886
He believes that he is the
master of his awn life and destiny.

370
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,747
An enigma.

371
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,222
A scientific genius.

372
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:42,791
His research of many years
is now capable of changing the world-.

373
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:52,268
But he began every experiment
with the aim of changing himself.

374
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,471
It ls rather ironic that...

375
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:04,176
a brain so sharp ls housed in a body
that ls paralyzed below the neck...

376
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,516
except for two of his fingers.

377
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,428
Unbelievable as It ls,
but It ls true...

378
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:18,962
that Kaal can conjure up the power
of his mind into these two fingers...

379
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:23,098
to lift things, make them fly, or
destroy them, through telekninesis.

380
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:29,437
Yet, he has been attempting
to obtain the bone marrow...

381
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,411
which would rejuvenate him.

382
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:36,947
But when Kaal,
with his unusual DNA...

383
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,385
could not find his
cure among humans--.

384
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,983
He began experimenting on animals.

385
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:47,395
Fusing together his DNA and
blood with that of the animals'-..

386
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,260
Kaal created creatures
as one creates test tube babies.

387
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:52,494
in this process,
Kaal made such amazing creatures...

388
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,070
whose mind and soul were Kaal's.

389
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:59,835
Human in appearance but
beastly in nature and strength.

390
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,300
Kaal has named them...

391
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,341
Manimals!

392
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:10,317
But despite all efforts Kaal
hasn't found the bone marrow yet.

393
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,856
His search still continues.

394
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,119
initiate!

395
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:47,915
Start Deliquldatlon!

396
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,134
Fusion ls the future!

397
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,710
Begin the final test-.

398
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,979
Kaal... - Let It learn
to survive in this environment...

399
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,149
and, continue your research.

400
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,387
I am sure you will
find that bone marrow.

401
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,585
And success will be yours soon.

402
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,458
I am successful even today.

403
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:12,530
You may have noticed the lethal
strike of my new manimal, Striker.

404
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,436
Success was Kaal's...

405
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:18,707
even when he made you.

406
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,373
Fusing my blood with
that of a chameleon's.

407
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,743
That's the reason you
can change your form and shape.

408
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,245
Wherever, whenever.

409
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,319
Let's find out how many lives
the virus has claimed in Namibia-.

410
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,626
These red dots indicate
that more than...

411
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,065
40%of Namibia's population
has been infected by the virus.

412
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:50,501
This has thrown many genius
scientists off their keel.

413
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:54,300
Our scientists want to know
when we should send our antidote.

414
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,641
Let sortie more people die.

415
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,475
Let there be more fear.

416
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,678
It's simple science, Kaya.

417
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:13,492
Our profit will rise
as people's hopes fall.

418
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,435
This virus ls not natural...

419
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,070
It was created.

420
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:27,567
But, sir...who would do such a thing?

421
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,111
A madman.

422
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,774
Dr. Mehra,
an antidote has been successfully...

423
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,177
...made for the virus
outbreak in Namibia.

424
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,450
This breakthrough was achieved by a
company called Kaal Pharmaceuticals.

425
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:44,284
The antidote has reached Namibia
and the situation ls under control.

426
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,195
Thank God!

427
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,096
This antidote has
proved yet again that...

428
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,400
there are more kind hearted
people than evil ones.

429
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:00,774
<i>Krrish .</i>

430
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:02,534
<i>Krrish .</i>

431
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,474
Al Sabah 13th floor, Millat Nagar.

432
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,183
Help! Help me!

433
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:10,544
Mummy!

434
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,118
<i>Somebody, he“)!</i>

435
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,382
Vicky!

436
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,854
Help! Help me!

437
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:17,787
Help me.

438
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:37,608
There's no need to be scared anymore,
you are safe now.

439
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,444
Okay'?

440
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,349
in fact, we're both safe.

441
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,150
But tell me something...

442
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,782
what were you doing up there?

443
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:55,524
I was doing my homework, when
l saw a pigeon stuck in the wires..-...

444
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,165
struggling to break free.

445
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,895
So I went up to the
roof to set It free.

446
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,468
Though I have small hands...

447
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:05,572
I managed to set the pigeon free.

448
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,540
But I got trapped.

449
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,668
Mother, help me. Mother.

450
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,906
But you saved me, Krrish.

451
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,511
Thank you, Krrish.

452
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,683
Thank you...

453
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,510
Krrish.

454
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:20,881
Me?

455
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,487
You saved the pigeon's life.

456
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:28,364
Anyone who takes away tears
and spreads happiness is Krrish!

457
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,362
Wow, even lam Krrish!

458
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:31,862
Yes .

459
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:35,802
But, Krrish,
yea have a mask, a suit...

460
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,571
and super powers.

461
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:39,366
What do I have?

462
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:45,470
You have an innocence which
has taught me a lesson today-.

463
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:49,206
That, age doesn't matter,
courage does.

464
00:36:54,545 --> 00:37:00,723
Here's a small gift,
from Krrish, to little Krrish.

465
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,434
This ls now the symbol of
your honesty and righteousness.

466
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,598
Welcome to the team.

467
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,772
Team? I am a part
of you r team, Krrish?

468
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,439
Yes, but you must promise me that...

469
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,302
you won't try to imitate me by...

470
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,905
...climbing,
jumping and leaping off buildings.

471
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,818
Promise? - I promise, Krrish.

472
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,259
Gone.

473
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,267
Sir... yes, sir?

474
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,867
Welcome!

475
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,339
How nice of you to make It an time!

476
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,306
Might as well have
come after we closed.

477
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,642
By the way,
may I ask you what took you so long?

478
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,439
I had to go, sir.

479
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,274
You had to go?

480
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:53,838
Yes, sir.

481
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,611
It was more Important than your job?

482
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:56,548
No.

483
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,948
The guests were waiting
for Chinese food...

484
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,955
and they left with a mouthful
of indian abuses- - Breaking news!

485
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:01,648
Do you get It?

486
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:04,420
Eternal savior,
Krrish, rescued another kid and...

487
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,791
safely reunited him with his family.

488
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:10,760
Proving yet again, where
there's crisis, there is Krrish.

489
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,469
On one hand there's Krrish.

490
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,071
He flies like the wind,
winning over hopeless situations.

491
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,807
Yes. - And,
on the other, there's you.

492
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,571
You run like the wind
from situations which need ye...

493
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,008
You could learn
something from Krrish.

494
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,813
Perhaps,
if you'd been more like him...

495
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,814
I wouldn't have to sack you.

496
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:31,815
You are fired!

497
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:35,785
Sir, please.

498
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:43,728
And, before we wind up,
another breaking news.

499
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,501
Our reliable sources
have confirmed that...

500
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,663
Krrish will be off duty,
starting 11 :30 tonight.

501
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:51,899
That's It for now.

502
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,632
This ls Priya Mehra, Aaj Tak.

503
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:21,026
Happy birthday to you.

504
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:24,368
Happy birthday to you.

505
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,840
Happy birthday dear Krishna.

506
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,879
Happy birthday to you.

507
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,816
Happy birthday, husband!

508
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:47,394
This ls the best surprise ever!

509
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,730
Well, I've also got
yea the best gift ever!

510
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:53,424
What?

511
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,439
We're going to have a baby!

512
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,778

“Tonight's pa ﬂy"

548
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:23,304

552
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,087
"I want to move"

553
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,150
"Check It out"

554
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:11,056
"More colorful than colors"

555
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,953
"A moment so wonderful yet deep"

556
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,657
“This time will never come again"

557
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:22,770
"We might never get this chance again"

558
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:26,304
"Newer dreams, light up my eyes"

559
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,168
"My thoughts go through a crazy riot"

560
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:33,905
"My desires have lost direction"

561
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,313
"My friends"

562
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:43,020
"My friends"

563
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:48,462
"My friends, salute to you all"

564
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:52,223

"Raghupati Raghav"

570
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:14,381
"Raghupati Raghav"

571
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:42,381
Today ls a very happy day for us.

572
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:47,416
When kids grow up...

573
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:49,422
they start treating elders like kids.

574
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:52,851
I know It's Krishna's birthday today.

575
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:56,195
I've even got him a gift.

576
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,002
There's some other good news.

577
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,535
And Mr. Balgopal will
tell you what It ls, himself.

578
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,337
Some other good news?

579
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,971
And, who ls Mr. Balgopal?

580
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,875
I don't think I even
have any friends by this name.

581
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:19,920
Actually, I may just.

582
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,212
One can't even recall all
the names of his friends at this age-.

583
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,824
Balgopal?

584
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,329
That's your name tool

585
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:46,339
You are going to be a grandpa.

586
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:51,912
Grandpa?

587
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:56,155
Really?

588
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,122
Yes, Papa-

589
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:27,345
Every father wants
to see his kids grow up.

590
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,216
Wants to play with them,
fool around with them...

591
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:33,153
But that joy was taken away from me.

592
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:38,490
I could not see the number
of times you fell dawn...

593
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,397
the number of times you
got back up on year feet-..

594
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,202
All the times you came
home covered in mu ck.

595
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,570
I still regret net being
able to witness all of that-.

596
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,504
But, now, I have no regrets.

597
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:52,607
No complaints.

598
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,149
So what If I couldn't
be there as a father.

599
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,478
I will be there now, as a grandpa.

600
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:00,646
I will live up your childhood...

601
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:02,988
through your child-.

602
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:11,423
Thank you, Priya,
for completing our small family.

603
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:13,323
And yes.

604
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:17,638
Happy birthday, Krishna.

605
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:22,133
Here's a small gift for you-..
for both of ye...

606
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,506
Okay, Pa Pa-

607
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:28,145
And I will distribute these
sweets among my colleagues.

608
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,475
Everyone will be thrilled.

609
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,517
It will be a fun day.

610
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,202
What are you doing, Kaal?

611
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:29,170
If only l had the use
of all of my fingers...

612
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,673
my whole hand...

613
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,448
my entire body-.

614
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:43,416
You have no idea what
I would be capable of.

615
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,321
I am still amazed...

616
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,552
how you manage to do, what you do.

617
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,595
How did you get these powers?

618
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:52,460
What ls the secret behind It?

619
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,992
inspite of being so powerful,
why Is...

620
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:57,231
...your body still
wheelchair bound, Kaal?

621
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:03,544
Kaal, you are choking me.

622
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,274
It hurts.

623
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,007
And It should.

624
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:10,313
Because, you have hurt me.

625
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:14,152
By asking me the question...

626
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:17,318
for which I don't'! have an answer.

627
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:23,027
And lam still searching for It.

628
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,631
What are you doing, son?

629
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:34,302
Don't misuse your powers.

630
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:37,804
Don't use your powers
for destruction.

631
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:41,548
How many times have I told you, Kaal?

632
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,742
And haw many times
have I asked you, dad?

633
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,285
How did I get these powers?

634
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:47,781
Why am I like this?

635
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:49,515
I don't know that.

636
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,782
You have been lying all this while.

637
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,057
You are lying new too.

638
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,188
Trust me, I am telling you the truth.

639
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,661
Stop It, Kaal.

640
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:09,467
Kaal...

641
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,313
I didn't find an answer then.

642
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:21,853
Even after all this research,
all these experiments...

643
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,625
I still haven't found the answer-.

644
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:29,188
But, I know science has the answer.

645
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,331
And, therein lies my cure-.

646
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,298
My cu re lies in that answer-.

647
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,138
I have spent millions.

648
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,646
I will spend billions.

649
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:52,814
Doctors, how much have we earned
from the antidote sales in Namibia?

650
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:57,724
320 million dollars and counting.

651
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:00,852
A little fear and
320 million dollars.

652
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,529
And still counting!

653
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,361
The business of fear...

654
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,568
ls the best business.

655
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:12,531
But now millions are net enough,
we need to earn in billions.

656
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:17,508
It ls now time,
to plant the virus in a country...

657
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,274
that has a population of billions.

658
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,462
india? Or, China'?

659
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,634
China's population surpasses
that of india, Kaal.

660
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:45,469
But a million Gods rule over india.

661
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:48,502
And people have
immense faith in them.

662
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:53,814
Let's find out if
any one of their Gods--.

663
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:59,648
Can save them from our virus.

664
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:32,773
Krishna, let's have Ice cream?

665
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:34,514
Ice cream?

666
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:36,642
But I heard, during pregnancy...

667
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,878
women like to have sour things.

668
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:39,846
But I am craving for sweet things.
- Really?

669
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:43,288
Because I want our baby
to turn out sweet, like you.

670
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:44,825
Aka)'-

671
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:47,823
Let's go and sit there.

672
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,521
Stop licking the ice cream like that!

673
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:57,299
You ate up my ice cream'?

674
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,540
I thought you got it for me!

675
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:05,945
I couldn't eat my own!

676
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:07,071
How could I eat yours?

677
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,407
Let's get another one. - Let's go.

678
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,586
Kripal, what's up'?

679
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:13,843
I am quite worked up.

680
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,547
I am trying to control my anger.

681
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,956
Because I was just accused
of being an Ice cream thief.

682
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:24,558
We'd like to have same flavor again.
- Okay, sir.

683
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,997
So, what will you have?

684
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:36,107
So, you are handing
over empty cones to us!

685
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:37,035
Sir, I had filled it.

686
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,108
If It was full, why ls It empty now?

687
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:39,847
Sir, you can see while
I fill the scoop again.

688
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,347
Yes, do It in front of me.

689
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,783
Two choco blocks, please.

690
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:48,785
Sir, you saw It for yourself!
I had filled It!

691
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:51,358
Yeah, he filled
It and yet It's empty.

692
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:53,385
Mummy, my Ice cream?

693
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:54,929
I just got you one.

694
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:57,896
Where's my Ice cream gone?

695
00:55:57,987 --> 00:55:59,432
Where ls my Ice cream?

696
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:01,001
Mummy, my Ice cream?

697
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:03,071
Can you fill It once more please?
- Yes. sir.

698
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:23,386
What ls It?

699
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,526
I'll be right back.

700
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:27,659
But...

701
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:47,965
Yes, KaYa-

702
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:52,908
Kaal, Mumbai's pulse
ls about to change.

703
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,489
Nerve wracking reports coming
in from several parts of Mumbai.

704
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:06,584
This virus ls spreading
across Mumbai city.

705
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:09,493
The whole of Mumbai has been engulfed
by a horrifying, unknown disease.

706
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:11,065
First report came in
from 'CST Railway Station'

707
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:14,795
in no time, a perilious
virus has taken over Mumbai.

708
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:18,134
On roads, offices and from
every where same reports are coming

709
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,139
Similar kind If reports
are started coming from"

710
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,834
"other parts of city as well.

711
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,038
As you can see...

712
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:29,810
fear and horror have
spread everywhere.

713
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:32,978
Every hospital ls facing
a similar or worse situation.

714
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:37,718
Countless people are critical.

715
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:42,160
And, 117 people have lest their
lives to the rapidly spreading virus.

716
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:45,632
Someone call a crane
to move this truck.

717
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:46,994
Dad, get up!

718
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,831
Wake up, dad, please!

719
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:55,172
Krrish, please help.

720
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:56,903
My wife's in a bad condition.

721
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:31,877
Krrish..- my dad...

722
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:38,914
Krrish, save my child

723
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:40,787
Krrish, my children...

724
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:45,989
Krrish, please save my wlfe...

725
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,028
Save my father.

726
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:04,971
Krrish, please help!
- Krrish, please help!

727
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,929
My fear has come true.

728
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:30,265
It's the same virus that...

729
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:34,701
claimed thousands
of lives in Namibia-.

730
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:37,203
Oh my God!

731
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:40,047
But there ls an
antidote for this virus.

732
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,116
Contact Kaal
Pharmaceuticals Immediately.

733
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:54,058
Kaal, after what
happened with Striker...

734
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:56,925
we should be wary of Krrish.

735
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:01,366
Our virus will test him too.

736
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:06,306
The indian government has
weakened due to this virus, Kaal.

737
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:10,103
They are contacting
our dealers repeatedly.

738
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:20,019
Kaal, the key component
of the antidote ls ready.

739
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:22,953
We must start working on
the antidote as soon as possible.

740
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:26,026
How long will It take
for our scientists to make It?

741
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,693
10 days!

742
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,456
The city will be dead in 10 days!

743
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:36,759
People are dying in front of me,
in my arms.

744
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:38,461
I can hear their screams...

745
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:40,764
and, lam helpless.

746
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:43,004
I am helpless, papa.

747
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,741
What is the point of me being Krrish?

748
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:49,076
There ls a palm.

749
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:52,776
There ls.

750
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:57,222
inspite of being around infected
people, you are net affected-.

751
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:03,023
And neither ls Priya,
as she ls carrying your baby.

752
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:09,102
All my colleagues have
fallen prey to this virus.

753
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:11,263
All except me.

754
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:16,871
That means,
we are Immune to this virus.

755
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,048
Perhaps, our blood
has something that ls...

756
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:25,149
shielding us, protecting us.

757
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:29,053
What are you doing?

758
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:30,453
If I remain Immune to this virus...

759
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,192
...even after It ls
infused in my blood then...

760
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,952
my blood can be used to
make an antidote for this virus.

761
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:36,325
No, Papa-.

762
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,096
I won't let you do this-.

763
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:41,365
Krishna, this ls the only
way to find a cure for the virus.

764
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:43,164
Then, inject It in my blood.

765
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:47,799
No, that's toe risky.

766
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:51,308
I could put you under risk--.

767
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:53,512
But, not the people's hope.

768
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,476
Right now,
you are everyone's last hope, papa...

769
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,519
not me!

770
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:02,388
Test It on me.

771
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:06,784
But.

772
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:07,884
Please, papa.

773
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,396
Krishna.

774
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:51,363
Krishna!

775
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:08,088
I am okay.

776
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:13,919
I am okay.

777
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:20,432
This means, I can make
an antidote from your blood.

778
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:23,368
Now, we will be able to save people.

779
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:26,338
It should take only a few hours...

780
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:28,874
But...

781
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,880
How can we provide the anitode
to so many in so little time?

782
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:38,481
How will we do that?

783
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:54,960
Kaal, there's a problem.

784
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:56,425
I don't know how...

785
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,557
but, the effect of our
virus ls wearing off in Mumbai.

786
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:08,640
One of you has betrayed me.

787
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:11,400
You have cheated Kaal.

788
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:17,375
I warned you that the antidote should
not reach india until after 10 days.

789
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,116
How, then?

790
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:24,086
Who did It?

791
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:25,983
No one, Kaal.

792
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:27,994
We are still making our antidote!

793
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:31,992
Rumor has It, that a scientist from
a research institute in Mumbai...

794
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:34,034
has managed to create
the antidote to our virus.

795
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,430
What?

796
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:37,197
What nonsense?

797
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,638
How can a measly
scientist manage to...

798
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:45,002
find an antidote for Kaal's virus?

799
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:52,081
The antidote can
only be prepared from...

800
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:53,752
my DNA..-...

801
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:56,523
my blood.

802
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:03,323
And how can anyone get It?
From where?

803
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:05,255
How?

804
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:16,071
How can my blood be coursing
through someone else's veins?

805
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:19,236
How?

806
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,708
<i>Mumbai has once again proved...</i>

807
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:55,580
to be unstoppable, unafraid, invincible
by vanquishing this virus.

808
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:59,445
I salute the courage of this city-.

809
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:01,654
The spirit of Its citizens...

810
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:06,185
and more importantly
the real hero of this victory.

811
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,460
A friend ta the kids-..

812
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:09,857
A hope for the grown-ups...

813
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:12,127
and, the support to the elders...

814
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,432
our very own, Krrish.

815
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:16,768
If you are present here...

816
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:18,604
or wherever you are...

817
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:22,142
please know that words
aren't enough to thank you.

818
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:26,370
Yet, we have attempted in
our small way to felicitate you

819
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:29,176
and, this shall be the
new Identity of the city.

820
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,843
And, to present to you all,
this new Identity...

821
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:34,714
I would like to call upon stage..-...

822
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:36,784
the man, without whom...

823
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,122
even Krrish's efforts
would have been futile...

824
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:40,859
<i>Dr. Rohit! Mehra.</i>

825
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,690
Please come, sir.

826
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:10,491
Thank you for all your love.

827
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:12,324
Thank you so much.

828
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:16,593
But, lam sure If
you were in my place...

829
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:18,460
you would have done the same.

830
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:20,757
I was merely a medium.

831
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:22,830
Our effort has been successful...

832
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:24,769
"because of your
prayers and well wishes.

833
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:33,905
I would also like
to thank Krrish--.

834
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:37,750
For making our nights safer and
gifting us a promise of a new day.

835
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:47,691
Sir, do you know Krrish?

836
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:54,967
I believe in Krrish.

837
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:57,666
I believe that...

838
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,633
we all have the essence
of Krrish in us.

839
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:05,506
Every person, who uses
their abilities to help others...

840
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:06,974
who extends a helping
hand selflessly...

841
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:08,771
who stands by those in need...

842
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,407
ls, indeed Krrish.

843
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,480
We all have Krrish in us.

844
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:13,915
Even lam Krrish.

845
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:15,319
Krrish told

846
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,448
when leaved a pigeon.

847
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:19,220
He also gave me this symbol.

848
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:20,283
Even I have one.

849
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:21,623
Me too.

850
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:26,764
I have one mo!

851
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,843

852
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,578
"Created man"

853

"The Almighty"

854
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:28,026
"Created man"

855
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:35,301
"Who has come on this earth"

856
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:37,064
“To execute His plan"

857
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,604
"He ls a friend's friend"

858
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,972
"A best friend"

859
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:51,807
"The evil ones fear his very name"

860
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:54,453
"The Almighty"

861
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,854
"Created man"

862
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:44,464
“Till yesterday he steed alone"

863
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:49,439
"I have decided to walk on His path“

864
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:58,744
“Till yesterday he steed alone"

865
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:03,649

"Together we make this
world a beautiful place"

01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:18,171
"Together we make this
world a beautiful place"

869
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:22,474
"We will bring the dawn of love"

870
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:25,706
"He ls a friend's friend"

871
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:27,805

"The Almighty"

"Created man"

877
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:55,492
Looks like Krishna's here.

878
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:56,900
I'll check, papa.

879
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,510
What's the matter, Priya?
Who ls It?

880
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:13,075
No one, papa.

881
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:26,665
Priya!

882
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:28,596
Priya!

883
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:32,000
Priya.

884
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:44,124
What's her blood group?

885
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:46,330
O positive.

886
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:50,202
Any medical history, any allergies?

887
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:51,998
No.

888
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,870
But, Priya ls pregnant.

889
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:07,921
Krishna, howls Priya?

890
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:10,886
I don't know anything yet, papa.

891
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:12,815
They have taken
her in for a check-up.

892
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:15,851
What's going on, Palm?

893
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:17,452
Don't worry.

894
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:18,930
We'll soon find out.

895
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:21,433
Thanks to you one of the
attackers ls in our custody.

896
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:24,031
I just hope... Mr. Mehra...

897
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:26,305
your wife ls alright now.

898
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:28,842
But, lam sorry to say,
we couldn't save the baby.

899
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:19,181
Papa.

900
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:24,161
It's going to be alright...

901
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:26,466
It's going to be fine-.

902
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:30,133
We don't need tears right now.

903
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:35,136
Because Priya needs you, Krishna.

904
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:37,305
You must make her smile again.

905
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:39,378
You must teach her
how to live again-.

906
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:42,312
And, only you can do It.

907
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,178
Only you, Krishna.

908
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:50,012
Welcome, Mrs. Priya Mehra.

909
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:55,254
I hope you had a pleasant journey.

910
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:57,415
Who are you?

911
01:21:57,479 --> 01:22:02,053
I know strange places
can be frightening.

912
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:04,261
You are in Kaal's world.

913
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:26,016
Here, lam trying to have
a conversation with you...

914
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:28,315
and you are trying
to run from

915
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:30,080
trying to attack me.

916
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:40,191
It's not safe to be running
in your condition, for both of you.

917
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:45,038
So, please, sit clown-.

918
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:50,742
Sit!

919
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:07,092
Who ls Krrish?

920
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,119
Who Is he?

921
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:12,197
I... I don't know.

922
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:15,025
But you do know...

923
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:16,296
that the antidote for my virus...

924
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:20,101
was created by your father-in-law,
Rohlt Mehra.

925
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:24,333
I'm sure you know how.

926
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:27,203
I don't know that.

927
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:29,748
But, I do know that...

928
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:34,144
only you have the answers
to all my questions.

929
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:37,349
Look, please...

930
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:40,015
my family...
my husband...

931
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:42,493
They must be searching for
And If they...

932
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:45,326
We search for things
that are missing.

933
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:47,756
But you are not missing, Priya.

934
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:50,559
You are here.

935
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:52,601
And there tool

936
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:56,340
Yes, two seats please.

937
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,679
Priya, all set!

938
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:11,350
First day, first shew-.

939
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:13,192
Shall we go?

940
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:29,468
Where are you lost?

941
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:31,674
I am right here.

942
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:33,471
in from of you.

943
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:36,271
You are in front of

944
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:38,173
but not with me.

945
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:39,341
What?

946
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:41,819
If you were really here...

947
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:44,147
you'd have sensed
that I have changed.

948
01:24:46,614 --> 01:24:49,220
Yes, ma'am,
starting today, I'm all you rs.

949
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:52,797
Just like your channel
entertains 24/7...

950
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,364
lam here at your service,
to entertain you.

951
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:56,663
48114.

952
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:57,792
I have the list ready for each day.

953
01:24:57,859 --> 01:24:59,133
From Sunday to Monday.

954
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:00,605
From shopping to cinema.

955
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:02,206
And, I won't ask for any leaves.

956
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:03,298
Nor any promotions.

957
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:04,502
I only want my salary.

958
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:06,375
Which would be--.

959
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:09,409
A few thousand smiles.

960
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:11,840
A few million hugs-.

961
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:13,881
A few billion kisses.

962
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:16,481
That's all I want.

963
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:19,853
So, where do we start?

964
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:23,290
You've read my mind.

965
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:25,322
Where do we start?

966
01:25:27,722 --> 01:25:32,796
We start by letting go of the past.

967
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,530
This ls really strange.

968
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:03,600
His heart is beating
only once every two minutes-.

969
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:07,238
This means, he ls hibernating.

970
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:11,203
in this suspended state,
along with this heart rate...

971
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:13,869
he can stay alive
for as long as he wants.

972
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:17,449
But, human beings can't do that.

973
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,779
But some animals can.

974
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:23,920
They hibernate underground...

975
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:26,656
and resurface only when
the weather ls favorable.

976
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:31,464
Perhaps,
he also has that very ability.

977
01:26:32,787 --> 01:26:36,291
He ls as much an animal,
as he ls human.

978
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:41,430
I guess, he can be called a mutant.

979
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:43,707
Mutant?

980
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:45,705
Yes, Krishna.

981
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:48,347
Ancient mythology like Mahabharata
and Ramayana had such creatures.

982
01:26:48,503 --> 01:26:50,574
Shurpnakha could
even change her form.

983
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:28,454
- Hello!
- Priya, are you okay?

984
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:30,920
- Yes, why?
- I will be late in coming home-.

985
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:35,493
Because one of the attackers
ls coming back to consciousness.

986
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:48,473
Once he ls awake perhaps
he can help us and we can help him.

987
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:52,901
And, he can tell
us who It Is that ls...

988
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:56,039
trying to attempt such a dangerous
subversion of laws of nature.

989
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:00,717
Priya!

990
01:28:02,577 --> 01:28:03,954
Priya, why did you come here?

991
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:05,789
I was getting scared.

992
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:08,051
No need to be afraid.

993
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:14,399
Krishna, lam afraid.

994
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:16,025
He will kill me.
He will kill us-.

995
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:17,564
Do something, Krishna.

996
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:18,899
Get a sedative, Immediately.

997
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,064
Papa, you have to kill him-.

998
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:22,501
No, no, you have to kill him,
Krishna. It'll be fine, Priya.

999
01:28:24,699 --> 01:28:26,337
Priya. - Kill him!

1000
01:28:26,834 --> 01:28:28,438
Father.

1001
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:29,709
Father.

1002
01:28:52,727 --> 01:28:53,933
That thing..-...

1003
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:55,906
he tried to kill me.

1004
01:28:56,531 --> 01:28:57,805
You saw It, didn't you?

1005
01:28:58,099 --> 01:29:00,340
If you weren't there to save me...

1006
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:03,440
What did lever do to them?

1007
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:04,906
Who are these people?

1008
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:06,815
What do they want from us?

1009
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:08,986
Priya, I can imagine
you are disturbed.

1010
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:11,956
But, please, calm down.

1011
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:15,558
Perhaps we would
have got some answers...

1012
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:17,853
if he had been alive for longer.

1013
01:29:19,454 --> 01:29:20,728
But, who are they?

1014
01:29:20,955 --> 01:29:22,457
And, why are they attacking us?

1015
01:29:22,623 --> 01:29:23,966
Attacking papa?

1016
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:25,733
You think It could be because...

1017
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,806
papa made an antidote
for the virus?

1018
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:31,773
Yes, I thlnk so too.

1019
01:29:31,933 --> 01:29:33,674
You are on the right track.

1020
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:36,747
We can't be sure...

1021
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:43,485
but, the attack seems to be linked
with the virus and the antidote.

1022
01:29:43,644 --> 01:29:45,419
It seems very probable.

1023
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:48,760
That means, they can come back.

1024
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:51,527
They can spread the virus again.

1025
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:54,024
We'd still be able to save people.

1026
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:55,997
But, how?

1027
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:57,695
They have burned the lab down.

1028
01:29:57,959 --> 01:29:59,563
Yes .

1029
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:03,706
But we still have the antidote.

1030
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:06,175
And If needed,
we can make more of It.

1031
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:14,143
How?

1032
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:16,611
How... papa?

1033
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:18,051
Because, Priya, we have--

1034
01:30:18,112 --> 01:30:21,457
Papa, I think,
her questions won't stop until...

1035
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:24,123
you make the antidote
in front of her eyes.

1036
01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:27,694
Because, she Isn't Priya.

1037
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:38,874
She ls just a journalist right now.

1038
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:41,605
Yes .

1039
01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:45,173
She is indeed interrogating
like a journalist.

1040
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:48,086
Because she hasn't
been to work for so long...

1041
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:50,487
the journalist in
her ls trying to surface.

1042
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:54,160
That's why, you should
resume work from tomorrow, Priya.

1043
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:56,155
And right now,
you are going to bed.

1044
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:57,821
- But, papa...
- Let's go.

1045
01:30:57,885 --> 01:31:00,832
Krishna, let papa tell us.

1046
01:31:00,888 --> 01:31:02,458
We should know this.

1047
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:04,936
There's no telling
when we might need it.

1048
01:31:05,026 --> 01:31:07,563
Father.
Listen to me, Krishna.

1049
01:31:07,628 --> 01:31:10,131
If we come to know how
papa makes the antidote...

1050
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:11,972
we could help him.

1051
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:14,112
This ls very Important.

1052
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:16,607
Why don't you understand?

1053
01:31:28,082 --> 01:31:29,857
I love you.

1054
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:52,780
Mr. Mehra,
here's your appointment letter.

1055
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:54,811
You can join from tomorrow.

1056
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:57,015
Thank you, sir.
- Ladles and gentleman...

1057
01:31:57,078 --> 01:31:59,581
It ls now time to announce
the names of this week's...

1058
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:02,093
...lucky draw winners,

1060
01:32:06,988 --> 01:32:09,298
Mr. Sachin Gupta.

1061
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:14,905
And our second place winner is Mr-
Pooja Misha-a-.

1062
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:20,203
And today's jackpot winner, who
has won Rs. 100,000... - Thank you.

1063
01:32:20,301 --> 01:32:21,746
Mrs. Avi Shah.

1064
01:32:21,802 --> 01:32:25,215
Hey! That's me.

1065
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:31,214
Hell?-

1066
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:55,169
My baby!

1067
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:58,843
MY baby, my baby!

1068
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:02,218
Thank you.

1069
01:33:02,343 --> 01:33:03,583
Thank you.

1070
01:33:03,644 --> 01:33:05,248
My baby!

1071
01:33:09,984 --> 01:33:11,588
Thank you!

1072
01:33:11,953 --> 01:33:13,694
This ls from all of us.

1073
01:33:15,356 --> 01:33:16,892
What's this?

1074
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:18,335
The symbol of Krrish.

1075
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:21,233
Anyone who steps up to help another
person, ls rewarded with this.

1076
01:33:22,363 --> 01:33:24,138
Where can I meet Krrish?

1077
01:33:24,632 --> 01:33:26,305
I do not know that.

1078
01:33:26,701 --> 01:33:29,045
I just know that
he ls always present...

1079
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:31,310
...at the right place,
at the right time.

1080
01:33:31,839 --> 01:33:33,284
And, when he Isn't...

1081
01:33:33,641 --> 01:33:38,249
kind people like you,
take his place.

1082
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:40,156
But, what did I do?

1083
01:33:40,681 --> 01:33:41,921
You did.

1084
01:33:41,983 --> 01:33:45,123
You have done what
any kind person would do.

1085
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:51,902
Your good human instincts
saved a child's life...

1086
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:55,172
...and her mother's as well.

1087
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:05,948
You don't understand, Krishna.

1088
01:34:15,016 --> 01:34:16,791
I love you.

1089
01:34:21,222 --> 01:34:22,724
"On heart"

1090
01:34:24,759 --> 01:34:27,365
"Tell me"

1091
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:32,200
"Where have you been hiding"

1092
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:36,408
"Why, today, for the first time"

1093
01:34:36,437 --> 01:34:41,250
"Have I felt you beat inside"

1094
01:34:44,011 --> 01:34:45,888
"on heart"

1095
01:34:47,314 --> 01:34:49,851
"Tell me"

1096
01:34:51,886 --> 01:34:54,264
"Where have you been hiding"

1097
01:34:56,991 --> 01:34:59,164
"Why, today, for the first time"

1098
01:34:59,226 --> 01:35:02,935
"Have I felt you beat inside"

1099
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:09,181
"Yes u

1100
01:35:10,037 --> 01:35:14,042
"My heart"

1101
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:18,824
"Has heard your"

1102
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:24,462
"Heart's call"

1103
01:35:24,752 --> 01:35:26,254
"on heart"

1104
01:35:28,089 --> 01:35:30,467
"Tell me"

1105
01:35:32,493 --> 01:35:35,497
"Where have you been hiding"

1106
01:35:37,798 --> 01:35:39,869
"Why, today, for the first time"

1107
01:35:40,034 --> 01:35:44,005
"Have I felt you beat inside"

1108
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:25,483
"The world around
me seems to be a lie"

1109
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:33,989
"The world around
me seems to be a lie"

1110
01:36:34,255 --> 01:36:38,863
"On my dreams I now rely"

1111
01:36:38,959 --> 01:36:43,430
"Lost in your embrace"

1112
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:47,940
"The world seems a better place"

1113
01:36:48,402 --> 01:36:51,144
"This love ls"

1114
01:36:52,006 --> 01:36:54,509
"Like that gust of wind"

1115
01:36:56,443 --> 01:36:59,014
"Like that tidal wave“

1116
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:07,296
"That sweeps away
everything in Its path"

1117
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:13,331
"I too have been swept away"

1118
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:15,270
"And have said"

1119
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:19,141
"Everything I wanted to say"

1120
01:37:20,267 --> 01:37:22,372
"I too have been swept away"

1121
01:37:22,469 --> 01:37:24,107
"And have said"

1122
01:37:24,872 --> 01:37:28,149
"Everything I wanted to say"

1123
01:37:28,209 --> 01:37:33,209
"My heart has heard
your heart's call"

1124
01:38:00,474 --> 01:38:04,354
"The sky ls within my reach"

1125
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:13,396
"The sky ls within my reach"

1126
01:38:14,188 --> 01:38:18,068
"And Earth feels like paradise"

1127
01:38:18,592 --> 01:38:23,166
"Does this happen in love"

1128
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:27,402
"To me, new everything feels nice"

1129
01:38:28,269 --> 01:38:29,612
"on heart"

1130
01:38:31,639 --> 01:38:33,676
"Tell me"

1131
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:39,123
"Where have you been hiding"

1132
01:38:41,315 --> 01:38:43,386
"Why, today, for the first time"

1133
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:47,965
"Have I felt you beat inside"

1134
01:38:51,025 --> 01:38:53,335
"Yes u

1135
01:38:54,361 --> 01:38:57,240
"My heart"

1136
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:01,607
"Has heard"

1137
01:39:03,404 --> 01:39:09,980
"Your heart's call"

1138
01:39:15,516 --> 01:39:20,124
Who am talking to?
Priya, or my Kaya?

1139
01:39:20,554 --> 01:39:22,261
I need some more time, Kaal.

1140
01:39:24,191 --> 01:39:26,364
I do not have time.

1141
01:39:28,362 --> 01:39:33,175
Bring me the information
by tomorrow or...

1142
01:39:35,636 --> 01:39:40,642
Kaal will obtain
It by his own means.

1143
01:39:52,753 --> 01:39:56,257
Doctor, are all
the parameters normal?

1144
01:39:57,124 --> 01:39:58,569
Parameters are normal.

1145
01:39:58,759 --> 01:40:00,739
The foetus ls healthy
and in the right position.

1146
01:40:01,095 --> 01:40:02,768
Then what ls It still
doing in It's mother's womb?

1147
01:40:04,531 --> 01:40:06,306
Get It out.

1148
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:08,642
Right away.

1149
01:40:08,702 --> 01:40:11,148
But why, Kaal?

1150
01:40:11,638 --> 01:40:18,749
I want to try injecting my DNA
in Its DNA at this foetal stage...

1151
01:40:18,779 --> 01:40:22,659
and see what generates.

1152
01:40:24,585 --> 01:40:29,585
Because, we have not yet conducted any
experiments with human foetuses.

1153
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:36,572
That's right, Kaal.

1154
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:38,132
But, It's too early.

1155
01:40:38,298 --> 01:40:41,507
Pulling the foetus
out right now ls dangerous.

1156
01:40:41,602 --> 01:40:42,808
It will die.

1157
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:45,614
Until the foetus
ls three months old...

1158
01:40:46,306 --> 01:40:48,115
we cannot take It out.

1159
01:40:48,542 --> 01:40:50,613
Nor, can we conduct
any experiments.

1160
01:40:51,111 --> 01:40:53,614
in fact,
we cannot even do a DNA test.

1161
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:56,793
How much longer?

1162
01:40:56,817 --> 01:40:58,455
At least a week, Kaal.

1163
01:41:00,521 --> 01:41:02,398
Only another seven days.

1164
01:41:04,558 --> 01:41:08,506
And your nine month long
ordeal will come to an end.

1165
01:41:10,397 --> 01:41:15,278
And perhaps get answers
to all my questions.

1166
01:41:25,512 --> 01:41:27,458
Krishna, where are you?

1167
01:41:29,316 --> 01:41:32,297
Some startling facts
have been revealed, Krishna.

1168
01:41:33,253 --> 01:41:34,596
At first, we discovered that...

1169
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:37,726
the DNA of the antidote supplied
by Kaal Pharmaceuticals...

1170
01:41:38,192 --> 01:41:42,698
ls a match to the DNA
of the mutant in our custody.

1171
01:41:46,133 --> 01:41:50,445
Even more alarming
truth ls the fact that...

1172
01:41:52,206 --> 01:41:55,881
the DNA of the antidote
created by us...

1173
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:59,690
ls also more or less the same.

1174
01:42:01,415 --> 01:42:03,554
I did several tests to confirm.

1175
01:42:04,251 --> 01:42:06,891
Every single time,
I get the same result.

1176
01:42:07,554 --> 01:42:08,760
But, how Is that possible?

1177
01:42:09,523 --> 01:42:11,230
Because we made
that antidote from...

1178
01:42:17,798 --> 01:42:19,903
- I guess Priya has woken up.
- Yes.

1179
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:21,613
- About the antidote...
- How Is she?

1180
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:24,339
She is fine.

1181
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:26,213
- The antidote... - Listen...

1182
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:29,177
lam leaving for
Singapore tomorrow.

1183
01:42:29,243 --> 01:42:30,381
Take care of yourself and Priya.

1184
01:42:30,477 --> 01:42:31,581
You are going to Singapore?

1185
01:42:32,746 --> 01:42:34,453
Why?

1186
01:42:34,915 --> 01:42:36,588
Because...

1187
01:42:37,651 --> 01:42:41,690
Singapore, Dr.
Arya. and his cruel intentions...

1188
01:42:43,257 --> 01:42:45,362
are all an Important
part of my past.

1189
01:42:47,694 --> 01:42:51,801
And, the facts that have surfaced
have raised many questions.

1190
01:42:52,866 --> 01:42:58,475
Perhaps, I can only find
the answers by revisiting my past-.

1191
01:43:12,219 --> 01:43:13,926
- There you are.
- What happened?

1192
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:15,399
Are you alright?

1193
01:43:15,455 --> 01:43:17,230
Yes, WNW

1194
01:43:17,691 --> 01:43:19,295
I don't'! know.

1195
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:21,472
I felt like you were calling
out to me from a distance.

1196
01:43:22,629 --> 01:43:26,907
I am right here with you-
Why would I call out to you'?

1197
01:43:27,467 --> 01:43:28,775
True.

1198
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:32,676
Papa had asked for some coffee.

1199
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:34,544
He ls still working.

1200
01:43:34,975 --> 01:43:36,511
But, it's quite late-.

1201
01:43:37,377 --> 01:43:38,856
Let me go check on him.

1202
01:43:38,912 --> 01:43:40,220
No.

1203
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:43,489
He said he ls working
on some Important research.

1204
01:43:43,717 --> 01:43:45,719
We shouldn't disturb
him until morning.

1205
01:43:45,986 --> 01:43:47,863
Come with me.
Come on.

1206
01:43:47,921 --> 01:43:49,491
Okay, let's go.

1207
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:21,728
What's the matter?

1208
01:44:22,389 --> 01:44:23,766
No.

1209
01:44:24,491 --> 01:44:26,493
Now, I cannot break
Krishna's trust.

1210
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:29,464
And...

1211
01:44:29,529 --> 01:44:30,940
what about Kaal's trust?

1212
01:44:33,467 --> 01:44:41,352
I will ask him to wait until
Rohit Mehra returns from Singapore.

1213
01:45:24,051 --> 01:45:24,791
Hello.

1214
01:45:24,851 --> 01:45:27,388
I have found all the answers
I was looking for, Krishna.

1215
01:45:27,554 --> 01:45:30,433
Coming to Singapore
was a good move.

1216
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:32,327
Singapore?

1217
01:45:32,659 --> 01:45:34,070
You're in Singapore?

1218
01:45:34,094 --> 01:45:35,402
When did you leave?

1219
01:45:35,462 --> 01:45:37,066
Why didn't you tell me?

1220
01:45:37,097 --> 01:45:38,576
Of course, I did.

1221
01:45:38,832 --> 01:45:40,402
I told you last night...

1222
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:41,911
when you came down to the lab.

1223
01:45:43,103 --> 01:45:44,707
Last night?

1224
01:45:45,505 --> 01:45:46,950
When?

1225
01:45:54,881 --> 01:45:56,554
And I was going to
share some more details...

1226
01:45:56,616 --> 01:45:57,993
but, Priya woke up.

1227
01:45:58,352 --> 01:45:59,831
Remember?

1228
01:46:05,092 --> 01:46:06,093
There you are.

1229
01:46:06,126 --> 01:46:07,696
What happened?

1230
01:46:08,595 --> 01:46:09,835
You're here with me.

1231
01:46:09,896 --> 01:46:11,136
But not really here.

1232
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:13,367
Shurpnakha could
even change her form.

1233
01:46:15,535 --> 01:46:18,414
If we find out how papa
made the antidote for the virus.

1234
01:46:20,507 --> 01:46:22,487
Krishna, yea have to kill him.

1235
01:46:23,677 --> 01:46:27,523
She is indeed interrogating
like a journalist.

1236
01:46:49,503 --> 01:46:50,982
Krishna...

1237
01:46:51,872 --> 01:46:53,442
Krishna...

1238
01:46:55,642 --> 01:46:57,019
Who are you?

1239
01:46:59,179 --> 01:47:00,681
Priya.

1240
01:47:01,014 --> 01:47:02,516
I am Priya Mehra.

1241
01:47:02,883 --> 01:47:04,157
You are not Priya.

1242
01:47:04,618 --> 01:47:05,756
Yes, lam.

1243
01:47:05,819 --> 01:47:07,890
I am Priya-.. Krishna!

1244
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:12,968
You aren't Priya.

1245
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:16,468
If you were...

1246
01:47:17,197 --> 01:47:21,475
you would know the truth
about Krishna and Krrish.

1247
01:47:24,771 --> 01:47:26,216
Tell me who you are!

1248
01:47:31,178 --> 01:47:32,885
Where's my Priya?

1249
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:34,684
Your Priya?

1250
01:47:34,748 --> 01:47:36,193
Yes .

1251
01:47:41,588 --> 01:47:43,033
Krishna?

1252
01:47:43,857 --> 01:47:45,234
Yes, Krishna.

1253
01:47:53,733 --> 01:47:56,509
Your tears might influence Krishna.

1254
01:47:58,738 --> 01:48:00,046
But, they won't fool Krrish.

1255
01:48:04,811 --> 01:48:06,017
Where's my Priya?

1256
01:48:07,547 --> 01:48:10,027
She ls in a safe place.

1257
01:48:11,051 --> 01:48:12,758
Priya and...

1258
01:48:14,187 --> 01:48:15,689
your child, too.

1259
01:48:32,606 --> 01:48:35,746
Believe me,
lam telling the truth...

1260
01:48:35,809 --> 01:48:37,288
to both Krishna and Krrish.

1261
01:48:42,249 --> 01:48:43,728
Where Is she?

1262
01:48:44,718 --> 01:48:50,794
Welcome to the world of Kaal, Dr.
Rohlt Mehra.

1263
01:48:51,625 --> 01:48:53,730
And, lam sorry...

1264
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:56,568
I had to bring you
here without your consent.

1265
01:48:58,565 --> 01:49:02,980
You went to Singapore
looking for some answers.

1266
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:08,084
Tell me, what did you find?

1267
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:15,323
That man should
never try to be God.

1268
01:49:17,751 --> 01:49:22,791
Many years ago, Dr. Arya
had held me captive in Singapore.

1269
01:49:25,091 --> 01:49:26,866
And during that period...

1270
01:49:27,327 --> 01:49:30,171
he conducted a strange
experiment on me.

1271
01:49:32,933 --> 01:49:34,344
Dr. Mathur...

1272
01:49:35,702 --> 01:49:38,945
If this experiment ls successful...

1273
01:49:40,807 --> 01:49:43,617
I will have created
a new Rohit Mehra-.

1274
01:49:44,911 --> 01:49:47,221
From his own blood, his own DNA.

1275
01:49:49,082 --> 01:49:55,328
With all of Rohit's mental
and physical powers...

1276
01:49:57,257 --> 01:50:03,264
but, controlled entirely by me.

1277
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:08,370
Dr. Arya did manage ta
create a child using my DNA.

1278
01:50:10,236 --> 01:50:12,944
But the child turned
out to be handicapped.

1279
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:17,711
Dr. Arya. instructed Dr.
Mathur to dispose of the baby.

1280
01:50:18,812 --> 01:50:20,951
But Dr. Mathur couldn't do so.

1281
01:50:21,748 --> 01:50:24,752
He left the baby
in an orphanage instead.

1282
01:50:25,085 --> 01:50:26,894
- And... - And then...

1283
01:50:29,723 --> 01:50:34,297
A rich man adopted
the handicapped child.

1284
01:50:36,062 --> 01:50:38,303
And raised him as his own.

1285
01:50:38,698 --> 01:50:43,169
That means, the one I
always regarded as my father...

1286
01:50:44,871 --> 01:50:46,316
was not really my father.

1287
01:50:49,042 --> 01:50:54,287
Because, that handicapped
child ls none other than me.

1288
01:50:55,715 --> 01:50:59,128
And you--. you are my father-.

1289
01:51:07,227 --> 01:51:08,433
I like It.

1290
01:51:10,296 --> 01:51:12,776
Everything's going
to be alright now.

1291
01:51:14,334 --> 01:51:16,905
I found you and with you...

1292
01:51:17,003 --> 01:51:19,847
I found the answers
to all my questions.

1293
01:51:20,774 --> 01:51:24,779
Now I'll find a cure
for my condition as well.

1294
01:51:26,079 --> 01:51:31,222
I just need a little help from you.

1295
01:51:32,285 --> 01:51:33,992
What help?

1296
01:51:36,923 --> 01:51:39,267
I need your bone marrow.

1297
01:51:42,162 --> 01:51:43,732
Bone marrow?

1298
01:51:48,268 --> 01:51:49,747
You can have It.

1299
01:51:51,037 --> 01:51:52,482
I will help you.

1300
01:51:54,174 --> 01:51:58,122
You will have to put
an end to what you are doing.

1301
01:51:59,379 --> 01:52:03,885
You must destroy this
little universe you've created.

1302
01:52:04,918 --> 01:52:06,261
Dad...

1303
01:52:07,387 --> 01:52:09,060
can I call you dad?

1304
01:52:09,823 --> 01:52:11,359
Of course I can...

1305
01:52:12,192 --> 01:52:13,967
yea are my clad indeed-.

1306
01:52:14,928 --> 01:52:16,771
Dad...

1307
01:52:17,097 --> 01:52:19,077
no terms and conditions.

1308
01:52:19,933 --> 01:52:21,935
Doing that will cause you...

1309
01:52:22,936 --> 01:52:24,779
a lot of grief-.

1310
01:52:25,805 --> 01:52:27,079
Because then...

1311
01:52:27,874 --> 01:52:29,478
I will be forced to take the DNA...

1312
01:52:29,509 --> 01:52:32,854
from the bone marrow
of the baby that...

1313
01:52:33,313 --> 01:52:35,156
Priya ls carrying.

1314
01:52:36,249 --> 01:52:37,956
Your grandchild.

1315
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:41,822
My grandchild?

1316
01:52:44,023 --> 01:52:45,502
But I thought...

1317
01:52:46,826 --> 01:52:49,136
- even before she could give--
- No...

1318
01:52:49,863 --> 01:52:51,399
the baby is alive.

1319
01:52:52,132 --> 01:52:56,080
Because, Priya is in my custody.

1320
01:52:57,203 --> 01:52:58,944
Do you want to see her?

1321
01:53:09,015 --> 01:53:10,289
But...

1322
01:53:11,050 --> 01:53:13,030
Priya ls... there...

1323
01:53:14,287 --> 01:53:17,325
That ls not Priya.

1324
01:53:18,324 --> 01:53:20,361
She ls one of my mutants.

1325
01:53:21,027 --> 01:53:22,973
Masquerading as Priya.

1326
01:53:23,496 --> 01:53:25,976
The real Priya ls
here and she's safe.

1327
01:53:26,332 --> 01:53:28,141
Her baby ls healthy.

1328
01:53:29,335 --> 01:53:31,212
And sols baby's bone marrow.

1329
01:53:32,038 --> 01:53:34,951
You may feel that we
are all alone right now.

1330
01:53:36,209 --> 01:53:39,315
And hence,
you may torture us all you want.

1331
01:53:41,447 --> 01:53:47,022
But, you don't know the
power of a father's tears.

1332
01:53:49,189 --> 01:53:54,195
That ls why you
cannot see him coming.

1333
01:53:59,165 --> 01:54:01,042
He ls our strength.

1334
01:54:02,335 --> 01:54:04,872
And he ls the end of you.

1335
01:54:11,477 --> 01:54:13,320
My real son...

1336
01:54:14,981 --> 01:54:16,392
Krrish!

1337
01:56:39,625 --> 01:56:41,161
Are you okay?

1338
01:56:41,227 --> 01:56:42,604
Yes .

1339
01:56:49,402 --> 01:56:50,574
Krishna...

1340
01:56:50,636 --> 01:56:52,013
Kaal is not in this facility.

1341
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:32,083
Come in, dad.

1342
01:57:40,787 --> 01:57:43,393
Look, I have found my feet.

1343
01:57:46,059 --> 01:57:48,437
- Whereas you...
- How do you feel, Kaal?

1344
01:57:51,597 --> 01:57:55,204
I was talking to my dad.

1345
01:58:19,826 --> 01:58:22,466
This ls just the beginning.

1346
01:58:23,629 --> 01:58:27,509
A lot of blood ls yet to be shed.

1347
01:58:31,604 --> 01:58:37,384
- Yes, Kaal?
- Kaya, thank you so much.

1348
01:58:39,846 --> 01:58:44,659
Because of you,
Rohlt Mehra ls with me.

1349
01:58:47,286 --> 01:58:51,735
Come back here,
from wherever you are.

1350
01:58:53,126 --> 01:58:55,163
Come to the facility
where I created you-.

1351
01:59:40,406 --> 01:59:45,185
Aren't you glad to
be back in your world?

1352
01:59:45,478 --> 01:59:46,821
Kaya?

1353
01:59:49,315 --> 01:59:50,521
Kaal?!

1354
01:59:50,583 --> 01:59:56,465
Kaya, now you shall bear
witness to Kaal's powers.

1355
01:59:56,956 --> 01:59:58,799
I'm going to destroy humanity...

1356
01:59:58,858 --> 02:00:01,498
and create a race
of powerful creatures.

1357
02:00:01,727 --> 02:00:03,832
This world belongs to me now.

1358
02:00:05,765 --> 02:00:07,472
It could have been ours...

1359
02:00:08,834 --> 02:00:12,646
but, you chose a different path.

1360
02:00:14,574 --> 02:00:16,417
By betraying me.

1361
02:00:23,983 --> 02:00:31,492
I knew you would bring Krrish here.

1362
02:00:34,493 --> 02:00:37,406
And that ls exactly
what I wanted you to do.

1363
02:01:18,938 --> 02:01:20,474
Krrish!

1364
02:01:23,943 --> 02:01:26,856
You are going to need your tears.

1365
02:01:28,581 --> 02:01:30,686
Save them...

1366
02:01:32,885 --> 02:01:34,990
for your father.

1367
02:01:37,290 --> 02:01:40,032
Sorry, for our father.

1368
02:01:42,028 --> 02:01:45,373
Yes, we are brothers.

1369
02:01:46,399 --> 02:01:49,380
Two sons of the same father.

1370
02:01:50,069 --> 02:01:52,049
The only difference Is that...

1371
02:01:52,071 --> 02:01:55,075
you are the child
born out of love...

1372
02:01:55,641 --> 02:02:00,021
and, lam the child born out of Dr.
Arya's insanity.

1373
02:02:00,780 --> 02:02:04,455
Ask him, If you don't believe me.

1374
02:02:08,688 --> 02:02:09,962
Papa?

1375
02:02:10,022 --> 02:02:13,629
I have only taken his bone marrow.

1376
02:02:15,828 --> 02:02:17,569
If he survives...

1377
02:02:17,963 --> 02:02:19,670
the world will end, Krishna.

1378
02:02:19,865 --> 02:02:25,008
Dad, you are asking one
son to kill your ether son'?

1379
02:02:28,341 --> 02:02:29,752
I like It.

1380
02:02:29,975 --> 02:02:33,923
I will gladly fulfil your wish.

1381
02:04:30,830 --> 02:04:33,606
Krrish, my victory
will be marked by death.

1382
02:04:33,666 --> 02:04:37,671
Your and your child's death.

1383
02:04:45,744 --> 02:04:49,920
No member of your
family will survive.

1384
02:05:13,639 --> 02:05:15,175
Krishna!

1385
02:05:18,844 --> 02:05:20,585
Krishna.

1386
02:05:22,047 --> 02:05:27,156
Look dad,
I made your wish come true.

1387
02:05:30,623 --> 02:05:34,901
Now, I do not even
need to kill ye...

1388
02:05:35,561 --> 02:05:39,236
Because the death
of your real son...

1389
02:05:39,765 --> 02:05:44,043
will finish you too, Rohlt Mehra.

1390
02:06:03,222 --> 02:06:04,326
Krishna...

1391
02:06:05,324 --> 02:06:06,997
Krishna, get up.

1392
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:09,234
Krishna...

1393
02:06:13,666 --> 02:06:14,940
Krishna!

1394
02:07:07,753 --> 02:07:09,391
Who are you?

1395
02:07:20,733 --> 02:07:22,735
Hey, did you get that?

1396
02:07:39,385 --> 02:07:42,855
The one that you
all pin your hopes on.

1397
02:07:43,656 --> 02:07:45,363
That you depend on.

1398
02:07:45,824 --> 02:07:48,168
Kaal has destroyed him.

1399
02:07:48,794 --> 02:07:51,707
I have killed Krrish!

1400
02:07:51,764 --> 02:07:53,107
What?!

1401
02:07:55,968 --> 02:07:57,675
Oh my God!

1402
02:08:00,239 --> 02:08:05,917
Yes, I have made Krrish a martyr-.

1403
02:08:06,345 --> 02:08:10,259
Now, It's Priya Mehra's turn.

1404
02:08:10,949 --> 02:08:12,292
So bring her to me.

1405
02:08:19,391 --> 02:08:23,737
The longer she takes to reach me...

1406
02:08:24,463 --> 02:08:30,141
the more I will torture you all.

1407
02:10:14,373 --> 02:10:16,512
A filter with a brain.

1408
02:10:19,945 --> 02:10:21,481
A filter with a brain.

1409
02:10:26,819 --> 02:10:28,457
A filter with a brain.

1410
02:10:36,228 --> 02:10:37,901
Please God.

1411
02:10:39,064 --> 02:10:43,012
Please God.

1412
02:11:24,910 --> 02:11:30,019
Krishna, never think you are alone.

1413
02:11:31,383 --> 02:11:33,624
Because no one ever really dies.

1414
02:11:34,553 --> 02:11:37,397
The soul... the energy...

1415
02:11:37,623 --> 02:11:40,399
It only gets transferred
from one body to another.

1416
02:11:41,193 --> 02:11:44,265
Old lives end but
return as new lives.

1417
02:11:45,664 --> 02:11:49,134
Look, Krishna...

1418
02:11:50,035 --> 02:11:52,447
lam coming back
to life within you.

1419
02:11:52,671 --> 02:11:55,015
Our powers are uniting.

1420
02:11:55,474 --> 02:11:57,420
We'll always be together.

1421
02:11:58,677 --> 02:12:00,418
I'll stay alive in you-.

1422
02:12:00,612 --> 02:12:02,592
And in your memories.

1423
02:12:05,284 --> 02:12:09,130
And you will forever
be in my blessings.

1424
02:12:59,538 --> 02:13:02,075
What are you doing, Vicky?
Vicky, where are you going'?

1425
02:13:02,207 --> 02:13:03,550
Vicky!

1426
02:13:24,529 --> 02:13:26,668
Emotional fools.

1427
02:13:27,432 --> 02:13:30,413
All you silly and helpless
people are like insects to me.

1428
02:13:30,702 --> 02:13:32,045
An inferior race.

1429
02:13:32,104 --> 02:13:34,414
One that I can crush anytime.

1430
02:13:35,374 --> 02:13:38,355
How will you save her?

1431
02:13:38,410 --> 02:13:40,253
We'll give our lives for her-.

1432
02:13:40,312 --> 02:13:41,655
No!

1433
02:13:42,214 --> 02:13:44,194
We'll take his life.

1434
02:13:44,649 --> 02:13:46,185
I like It.

1435
02:13:46,718 --> 02:13:49,665
You have quite an attitude
for someone so small.

1436
02:13:49,721 --> 02:13:51,359
So what If I am small?

1437
02:13:51,656 --> 02:13:53,329
One's courage should be undettered.

1438
02:13:53,625 --> 02:13:54,763
Krrish said so.

1439
02:13:54,793 --> 02:13:57,273
Krrish...ls no more!

1440
02:13:57,329 --> 02:13:58,808
This ls the era of Kaal !

1441
02:13:59,364 --> 02:14:01,537
Krrish ls the courage within us.

1442
02:14:02,501 --> 02:14:04,640
And cannot be killed by any Kaal.

1443
02:14:07,139 --> 02:14:12,350
Krrish will remain alive
until the last one cf us is alive.

1444
02:15:13,105 --> 02:15:14,243
What's the matter, Kaal?

1445
02:15:14,306 --> 02:15:15,717
Scared?

1446
02:20:34,893 --> 02:20:36,566
Krishna!

1447
02:20:38,062 --> 02:20:47,813
Such a wonderful family reunion.

1448
02:20:48,907 --> 02:20:51,854
Who do I kill first?

1449
02:20:53,445 --> 02:20:54,788
Father?

1450
02:20:55,447 --> 02:20:58,155
Or son?

1451
02:21:03,721 --> 02:21:05,223
Look at yourself.

1452
02:21:06,191 --> 02:21:09,900
You are just an
ordinary human being.

1453
02:21:10,995 --> 02:21:12,941
An ordinary son.

1454
02:21:13,765 --> 02:21:15,938
A weak father.

1455
02:21:24,509 --> 02:21:26,716
Being human is not a weakness...

1456
02:21:27,245 --> 02:21:28,918
It ls my strength.

1457
02:21:29,681 --> 02:21:32,662
Because I have the
blessing of every father...

1458
02:21:32,717 --> 02:21:34,526
and the love of every child.

1459
02:23:09,113 --> 02:23:10,820
Krishna...

1460
02:23:20,758 --> 02:23:23,102
Surprlse !

1461
02:23:32,036 --> 02:23:33,913
Krishna, get up.

1462
02:23:34,706 --> 02:23:36,276
Krishna.

1463
02:23:38,876 --> 02:23:42,983
Only those who are born can die.

1464
02:23:43,748 --> 02:23:45,750
I was never born.

1465
02:23:46,651 --> 02:23:50,155
So, lean never die.

1466
02:25:19,243 --> 02:25:21,723
No matter haw powerful evil is-..

1467
02:25:21,979 --> 02:25:26,928
Good will always triumph over It.

1468
02:25:46,104 --> 02:25:51,076
Krishna, never think you are alone.

1469
02:25:52,777 --> 02:25:54,450
Because no one ever really dies.

1470
02:25:56,314 --> 02:25:58,191
We'll always be together.

1471
02:25:59,484 --> 02:26:00,986
I'll stay alive in you-.

1472
02:26:01,385 --> 02:26:03,365
And in your memories.

1473
02:26:04,322 --> 02:26:08,395
And you will forever
be in my blessings.

1474
02:26:24,175 --> 02:26:25,916
Mr. Krishna...

1475
02:26:30,782 --> 02:26:32,227
Mr. Krishna.

1476
