00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:26,050
Long live Aristotle!
Long live Aristotle!

Long live Aristotle!
Long live Aristotle!

5
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,370
Why is the Emperor's seat vacant?

6
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,070
Seleucus, I want to know
what work Alexander finds so important...

7
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,130
that he doesn't even have time
to attend to my proclamation.

8
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,520
Alexander has not told me anything.

9
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,690
- Juminees, do you know?
- No, respected guru!

10
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,960
But this wise man knows everything.

11
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,820
You are his teacher.

12
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,960
It is the world's biggest misfortune...

13
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,510
that when the most important matters
of state are to be discussed...

14
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,200
he, who appreciates such matters the most,
chooses to be absent.

15
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,300
Cancel this session.
We will not discuss business today.

16
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,810
I may please be excused for speaking...

17
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,190
but we're waiting eagerly
to hear something from you.

18
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,930
You want to listen to my proclamation?

19
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,020
But where is Alexander?

20
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:05,490
Rexrees! Rexrees!

21
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,580
Your Highness, I'd like
to once again humbly state...

22
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,510
that my name is not Rexrees,
but Rukhsana.

23
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,580
Maybe, but once the Emperor
takes a liking to something...

24
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,300
he gives it a Greek name.

25
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:38,100
As long as the Emperor had not seen you,
you were Rukhsana.

26
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,130
But the moment the Emperor
laid eyes on you...

27
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,160
and the Emperor took a liking to you...

28
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,040
you became Rexrene from Rukhsana.

29
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,890
And what about you, Your Highness?

30
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,360
In Greece, I was Alexander.
But Iran has made me Sikandar.

31
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,020
And you're not upset with Iran for this?

32
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,290
Upset? Why should I be upset?

33
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,120
Iran has given me
a beautiful damsel like you.

34
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,600
I thank the Emperor.

35
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,080
Alexander does not like
this old way of saying thanks.

36
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,800
Come here,
come close to the Emperor.

37
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,350
Place your fair arms around my neck.

38
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,350
Look into my intoxicating eyes
with your intoxicating eyes.

39
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,760
Bring a radiant smile
to your enticing lips.

40
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,620
And when I am thus
totally driven crazy by you...

41
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,480
then tell me,
in a beautiful and bashful voice...

42
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,720
"thank you".

43
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,270
The Emperor will accept
this "modern" thanks.

44
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,760
But, Your Highness...

45
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,170
now say "thank you".

46
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,080
Thank you.

47
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,610
I swear by God, your grace and mischief
add to your beauty.

48
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,260
I have prepared something
for Your Highness with my graceful hands.

49
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,300
The Emperor will appreciate it.

50
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,290
I praise anything made by your
graceful hands without even seeing it.

51
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,460
Rukhsana wants to hear praise for her,
not from your lips, from your eyes.

52
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,680
So should I bring it here and show you?

53
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,150
Do I have your permission?

54
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,500
I'll take that as a "yes".

55
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,670
A "modern" thank you!

56
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,490
- Rexrees!
- No, Rukhsana!

57
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,450
Rukhsana! See,
I've called you "Rukhsana".

58
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,450
So are you happy now?

59
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,300
But if you come before me again,
I'll still call you "Rexrees".

60
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,190
What a beautiful name it is!

61
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,640
Who's come to meet me now?

62
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,680
Tell him I cannot meet him.

63
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,920
Your guru Aristotle is here.

64
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,810
My guru!

65
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,810
May the Gods give you a longer life
than the Sun and the Moon!

66
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,430
I've come to tell you something.

67
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,630
Do you have time now?

68
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,250
I can never be so busy...

69
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,040
that I do not have time for my guru.

70
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,940
My son, may your fame
spread as far as the winds blow.

71
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,830
Is your mind free of the thought
of women at this moment?

72
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,040
If not,
then clear your mind right now.

73
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,170
Otherwise your mind will not
be able to receive words of wisdom.

74
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,240
My mind always has room
for whatever you may have to say.

75
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,270
Then listen to me.

76
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,410
I have only come to say that...

77
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,960
if you wish to conquer the world,
you need to first win over your own mind.

78
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:26,100
And if you wish to win over your mind,
then stay away from women.

79
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,300
A woman is
the biggest weakness of man.

80
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,750
He who gets entangled in
the world of women, gets destroyed.

81
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,990
This isn't something
I've just made up.

82
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,810
This is a lesson taught
to us repeatedly by history.

83
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,640
He who heeds my words,
will live the immortal life of the soldier.

84
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,050
He who does not heed my words,
will live in darkness like a common man...

85
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,150
and die in anonymity.

86
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,570
The beautiful creation,
of my beautiful hands!

87
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,050
Forgive me,
but I cannot stay for long.

88
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,940
Who was he
that was here just now?

89
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,090
What will you do,
knowing his name?

90
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,590
I will try to understand
what important work it was...

91
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,450
that had to come
between your love and my pleasure.

92
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,280
That was my guru, Aristotle.

93
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,650
And what did he tell you?

94
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:49,000
He said, "He who would conquer the world,
should stay away from women".

95
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,840
What else?

96
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:59,400
He said "A woman is
the biggest weakness of man".

97
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,780
Nonsense! A woman is a
man's biggest strength.

98
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,230
He who wants to conquer the world,
should have a woman by his side.

99
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,360
Without a woman, a man's life
is incomplete. She completes him.

100
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,910
You have spoken very well.

101
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,570
I ask for my reward.

102
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,950
And my reward
is that you sit here.

103
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:29,220
And drown your guru's advice
in just one glass of my house wine.

104
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,760
That will be difficult to do.

105
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,560
What will be difficult to do?
You are the Emperor.

106
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,700
You're the Supreme Commander, you're
the Nikator, you can do anything.

107
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,490
To the world I may be the Emperor,
the Supreme Commander, the Nikator.

108
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,730
But in front of my guru,
I am like a child.

109
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,030
If Aristotle wishes, he can
make any number of Sikandars...

110
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,070
but even if a thousand Sikandars
try their level best...

111
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,200
they will not be able
to make one Aristotle.

112
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,200
You have refused my wine!

113
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:17,130
You had given me this wine
to drown my guru's advice in it.

114
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,890
But there was
one other thing he said.

115
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,130
Do you have a strong enough heart
to listen to it?

116
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,500
Your lady has got a heart of steel.

117
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:33,640
He said "He who gets entangled
in the world of women, gets destroyed".

118
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,170
Now tell me what
you've to say to this.

119
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:42,120
I have to say that your guru
has insulted the role of women.

120
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,530
He has insulted
the maturity of women.

121
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,390
He has scorned the world of women.

122
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,770
And I, an unknown and insignificant woman,
will give him a fitting reply.

123
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,350
I will tell him that his age and stature
have no standing in front of women.

124
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,590
He thinks he is above everybody,
nobody can make an impact on him.

125
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,450
But I will prove that his reputation,
earned over a lifetime...

126
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,690
can be ruined by just
one glance from a woman.

127
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,410
You are crazy.
My guru is above all this.

128
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,200
But he is a man.
And every man has a heart.

129
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,480
I don't believe he has a heart.

130
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,030
And if he ever had one,
it is now dead.

131
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,650
A woman can bring
a dead heart to life.

132
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,370
Please do one thing.

133
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,290
Just stand by your window
tomorrow morning.

134
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,710
And when I clap my hands,
come over to your guru's garden.

135
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:40,850
Then you'll see that picture of your guru
that you cannot imagine.

136
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,560
Awake! Beauty approaches

137
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,480
Arise and open the door

138
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,480
Look at me...

139
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,910
say something

140
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,120
Smile a little...

141
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,680
sing a little

142
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,370
Bring some color into your life

143
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,950
You are lucky,
it is your good luck that...

144
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,166
your house is blessed with...

145
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,120
flowers and youth

146
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,660
Awake! Beauty approaches

147
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,310
It is time to drink nectar

148
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,090
It is time to live your life

149
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,470
Eat a little, drink a little

150
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,540
Live a little before you die

151
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,290
How often in a still pool...

152
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,080
do you get a new lease of life?

153
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,250
Awake! Beauty approaches

154
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,280
Who is this spoiling my garden?

155
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,170
I... I'm Rukhsana.

156
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,130
Rather, instead of saying
you've spoiled my garden...

157
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,890
I should say you've made
its flowers more beautiful...

158
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,240
and its air more fragrant.

159
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,850
You are not Rukhsana,
you are a fairy tale.

160
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,690
So I am a fairy tale?

161
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,850
No, I made a mistake.
You're not a fairy tale.

162
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,610
You are the dream that the youth
of this world dreams.

163
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,740
You are the song of love
that sings to beauty.

164
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,880
You are the story that the spring
tells in the ears of the flowers.

165
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:50,290
When I was young. Or, to be precise,
when the world was young...

166
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,800
there was a woman
of your age in Greece.

167
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,660
When she laughed, the entire world lit up.

168
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,320
When she spoke, the Spring
could not muster words in response.

169
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,450
She died.
And with her, my love died.

170
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,040
My heart died, my dreams died.

171
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,720
And, in my young age,
I became old.

172
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,030
Can a man become old
in his young age?

173
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,310
Yes, he can become
old in his young age...

174
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,030
and become young in his old age.

175
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,240
And today I feel as if it's not you
who's come to my garden...

176
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,680
but as if Spring's arrived in my old age.

177
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,690
Don't get startled, woman.

178
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,030
I will give you
everything in this world.

179
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,750
Tell me just one thing.
Will you be able to love me?

180
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,160
In other words, you will not.

181
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,160
Like others, you also
only look at appearance.

182
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,230
You don't look at the heart within.

183
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,120
If you cannot love me,
why do you come in my path?

184
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,670
To tell you the price of my love.

185
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,910
Tell me, I'll pay even the price
of the stars in the sky for it.

186
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,940
Are you really stupid, or are you
trying to make a fool of me?

187
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,040
No sane person will ever do this.
This is impossible.

188
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,280
Pity! You couldn't even accept
this token request in the name of love.

189
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,650
But what
will we achieve by this?

190
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,480
Okay, where's the harness?
I accept this childish demand of yours.

191
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,060
The world is surprised
when it sees my horse.

192
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,850
This sturdy horse of mine,
which I dote upon.

193
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,440
Come on, move.
Come on, move.

194
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,290
Come on, move.

195
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,670
- Show me some speed in your feet.
- Rukhsana!

196
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,020
"A woman is the biggest
weakness of man."

197
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:15,390
"He who wants to conquer himself,
should stay away from women."

198
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,120
Guru, please leave. This woman doesn't
deserve to stand anywhere near you.

199
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,490
You are wondering
what happened to your guru.

200
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,730
This woman is happy
she's gotten the better of me.

201
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:35,520
But I say that if a woman
can fool a wise old man like me...

202
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,590
then what can she not do
to a young man like you?

203
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,590
Old age is colder than ice, youth
is more red-hot than the embers.

204
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:49,520
Old age is wise and experienced,
youth is impulsive and inexperienced.

205
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:55,820
Old age observes and thinks,
youth observes but gets impatient.

206
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,610
I can only pray that the Gods above
give you eyes to see and ears to listen.

207
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:06,160
Just think, if a woman
can get an old man drunk on wine...

208
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,400
what magic cannot she do
on a young man?

209
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,120
This incident isn't
a defeat for your guru.

210
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,670
It is a lesson for you for life.

211
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,850
Always keep this in mind.

212
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,190
It will serve you well all your life.

213
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,390
You are mine.
And I am yours.

214
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:56,140
But until I have conquered India,
I will not appear before you.

215
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,380
Please bear one thing in mind.

216
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,660
Peace of mind comes not from war
or victory, but from peace and love.

217
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,470
May the Gods protect us!

218
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,050
Your goal is to conquer the world.

219
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,910
You go on ahead, we'll head back.

220
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,600
But I will need your advice
every step of the way.

221
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,430
I have given you
whatever advice I had to give you.

222
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,290
There was one thing remaining.

223
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,986
You needed to know what a woman
is capable of doing to you.

224
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,770
Today I've told you that too.

225
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,110
Now nothing more remains
to be told from my side.

226
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,590
So have faith in the Gods now.

227
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,250
Every country in the world
is waiting to accept you as their leader.

228
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,130
May the Gods protect us!

229
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,710
Seleucus, give the army its orders.

230
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,790
By God's grace, we will attack India.

231
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,220
Life exists because of love,
let it be spent in love

232
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,970
At the feet of beauty,
give up your heart...

233
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,870
give up your life

234
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,040
Life exists because of love

235
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,350
Life is but one night,
and love is the light of life

236
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,060
Let the light burn
for as long as possible

237
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,650
Partake of the brightness

238
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:54,860
Life exists because of love,
let it be spent in love

239
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,200
Life is a garden,
love brings color to it

240
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:10,880
Add some fire to it...

241
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,570
and drink it down

242
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:25,700
Life exists because of love,
let it be spent in love

243
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,040
Life is a gamble,
don't look at it from afar

244
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,490
Step up to it,
and put your life on the line

245
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,110
Smile even if you lose

246
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Life exists because of love,
let it be spent in love

247
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,790
Life is a passion,
live it with passion

248
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:12,300
Be the emperor of your life

249
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,020
Take over the skies

250
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:27,130
Life exists because of love,
let it be spent in love

251
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,750
Long live Alexander!

252
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,540
Long live Alexander!

253
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,670
- Long live the King!
- Long live India!

254
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,326
Tell me, what is the news?

255
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:19,630
Sikandar has crossed the Sind.
His army is now coming this way.

256
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,560
- How big is his army?
- More than 100,000 strong.

257
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,940
And King Ambhi didn't try to stop him?

258
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,000
I have heard that he's
decided to surrender to him.

259
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:36,140
So as soon as the fire heard
of the water, it extinguished itself?

260
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,380
Did you hear that, Prince Amar?

261
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,550
Maybe he wants to take
Sikandar's help to attack us?

262
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,140
He who doesn't try to protect himself...

263
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,510
will not even get protection from God.

264
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:52,440
When even the gatekeepers
have colluded with the marauders...

265
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,440
what becomes of the house?

266
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,650
If the inner doors of the house are strong,
there can be no damage to it.

267
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,440
And the inner doors
of the house are strong, Father.

268
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,890
Have faith in us, we will win.

269
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,640
Until now Sikandar has only
seen those who covet life.

270
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,710
He has not seen those
who value self respect.

271
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:14,230
Rest assured, each one of our soldiers
will take on four of theirs.

272
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,980
If this is true, then even
Brahma cannot defeat us.

273
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:22,190
Commander, you go and prepare for battle.

274
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,150
Minister, please send invitations to the
kings of Abhisar, Salkot and Kulut.

275
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,740
But will they come?

276
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:32,180
Why won't they?
After all they are human, not stone.

277
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,630
Write to them that a foreign force
has attacked our country.

278
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:40,320
If we don't unite and face up to this enemy,
future generations will call us cowards.

279
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,420
And our country will be ruled
by a foreign king.

280
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,900
A foreign king should not be allowed
to rule over our country.

281
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:51,450
Prarthana, you are my sister.
You should think of my welfare.

282
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,660
And you are King Ambhi. You
need to think of your country's welfare.

283
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,270
Whatever I am doing
is for the good of my country.

284
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,490
No way, you're doing
nothing for your country.

285
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,110
You care only for your life.

286
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,480
He who cares only for his own life,
cannot do anything in this world.

287
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,730
So what do you suggest I do?

288
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,680
Join hands with King Puru
and take on Sikandar.

289
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,580
That is impossible.

290
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,750
Then join hands with Sikandar
and cut Puru's throat.

291
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,580
And make India a slave country.

292
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,160
Why do you care
so much about Puru?

293
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:26,880
Because he's brave, and is willing
to lay down his life for his country.

294
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,950
But he is our enemy.

295
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,880
And he is a threat to our country.

296
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,360
If, joining hands with Sikandar, we get
rid of this thorn forever, what's wrong?

297
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,180
There was once a fight
between a horse and a lion.

298
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,670
The horse was weak,
the lion was strong.

299
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,730
A man told the horse
"I'll help you".

300
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,080
The horse was happy
at the offer of help.

301
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,010
The man said
"Take me on your back".

302
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,730
The horse obliged.

303
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,520
At that time somebody remarked, "You
fool, the lion will lose if it has to".

304
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,830
"But you've lost even before
the battle's started".

305
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,660
And you can see for yourself,
to date the horse is slave to man.

306
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,140
And to date, the lion is
king of the jungle.

307
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:17,550
Those who went for grand glory,
did not even retain what they had.

308
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,580
Do you realize what you are saying?

309
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:26,230
I'm only saying this deal you're
carving out will prove very costly for you.

310
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:30,230
I don't care how costly it is,
I will definitely go through with it.

311
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:35,580
When you're hell bent on selling
out your country and its freedom...

312
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,810
then from today, we are not
brother-sister anymore. Goodbye!

313
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,949
But where will you go? To Puru?

314
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,260
Yes, I will go to him.

315
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:50,189
Aren't you ashamed to leave
your brother and go to his enemy?

316
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:55,149
When the brother is not ashamed
to go to lndia's enemy, Sikandar...

317
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:59,530
why should the sister be ashamed
of going to lndia's friend, Puru?

318
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:05,150
You try to make India a slave,
I will try to keep India free.

319
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:14,760
Long live Alexander!
Long live Alexander!

320
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,620
What is this noise about?

321
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,890
The king of Takshila, Ambhi,
has accepted our terms.

322
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,580
- And his other friends?
- They too.

323
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,990
The Emperor is happy to hear this.
Make offerings to the Gods.

324
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,510
Your Highness, they have sent
a load of presents for you.

325
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:54,060
Long live Nicator Alexander,
long live Nicator Alexander!

326
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,300
Send them also Greek
and Iranian gifts from our side.

327
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,600
And, send them a message...

328
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,330
to come and receive their reward
as soon as they can.

329
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,640
They will be presented at the earliest.

330
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:16,840
Juminees, today we've secured
our first success in India.

331
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:23,910
Today I am happy, and I want
to share this happiness with my men.

332
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,810
So distribute all the presents
amongst the men.

333
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:32,660
And make sure our laborers
do not get left out.

334
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,606
The time you take to get
groceries from the market...

335
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,336
a person can go to Iran and back.

336
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,756
Excuse me today.

337
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:05,580
Today I'm not going to excuse you.
You've done this too many times.

338
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:10,230
- Then give me some punishment
- I won't. I leave that to your mother.

339
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,990
My mother will not punish me today.

340
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:17,500
- Why not?
- Today is Raakhi.

341
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:26,330
If you notice, everybody is singing,
dancing and enjoying themselves.

342
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,530
I'm also going to join them.
Goodbye!

343
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,980
Wait, wait! I will also join you.

344
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:35,250
- Nobody will mind, I hope?
- If anybody minds, I will handle it.

345
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,350
The days of monsoon are here

346
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,070
Buy me a veil

347
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,790
Every house is playing music

348
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,690
Buy me a veil

349
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:18,100
How long will I wear this old veil?

350
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,710
- My beauty wilts in it.
- Alas!

351
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,050
Buy me a veil

352
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:40,050
The days of monsoon are here

353
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,460
Buy me a veil

354
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,460
Every house is playing music

355
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,990
Buy me a veil

356
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,720
The new stole accentuates my beauty

357
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,820
The red stole brings out my color

358
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,230
It makes me look desirable

359
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,200
Buy me a veil

360
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:44,400
The days of monsoon are here

361
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,850
Buy me a veil

362
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:57,150
Every house is playing music

363
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,500
Buy me a veil

364
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,250
The gardens look beautiful

365
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:29,240
My mind is filled with love

366
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,930
My beauty calls out to you

367
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,890
Buy me a veil

368
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,920
The days of monsoon are here

369
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,330
I am worried.

370
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:01,680
When the world celebrates this season...

371
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,120
eyes are on you, too

372
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,460
The days of my youth have passed

373
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,770
With it my love has also gone

374
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,010
Who will bring back my lost time?

375
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,320
I am worried

376
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,620
The days of monsoon are here

377
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,210
Buy me a veil

378
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:54,240
Every house is playing music

379
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,720
Buy me a veil

380
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,230
Your dress suggests you are a foreigner

381
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,060
Your face says you are tired.
Sit down

382
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,990
Should I get you milk?
Would you like some sweets?

383
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:19,090
If you could bring some water,
that would be a big favor.

384
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,120
And if I get you milk,
would that be a small favor?

385
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:49,630
What's the occasion today?

386
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,070
Today is the day we celebrate
Rakhi in our country.

387
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,040
Today is the day sisters tie
a rakhi on their brothers' wrists.

388
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,550
And brothers give them
gold and silver in return.

389
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,296
And what about a girl
who doesn't have a brother?

390
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,140
Whoever she ties a rakhi to,
becomes her brother.

391
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,410
Oh, the festivals of India!
They make me "hoppy".

392
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:11,030
Not "hoppy", say "happy".

393
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,720
You're crying in vain
and spoiling your eyes.

394
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:23,230
I know you don't have a brother,
but who can force the hand of God?

395
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,990
Indeed, who can force the hand of God?

396
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,820
He chooses to give some
and not to give some.

397
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:35,370
Just look at our King.
He has seemingly everything, but no sister.

398
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,950
The King does not have a sister?

399
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:44,910
And even our princes have no sisters.

400
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,700
And you have no brother here.

401
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:50,570
That is why we'd like you
to tie rakhis for the princes.

402
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:53,740
They'll get a sister,
you'll get brothers.

403
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,210
As you say, Your Highness.

404
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:59,180
Then go quickly lest the princes
look the other way.

405
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:05,970
Till today we had only sons,
from today we have a daughter too.

406
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:09,320
A daughter is the pride of a home.

407
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,310
What home is that, where there's
no sound of a daughter's anklets?

408
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:17,410
What home is that, where there is no
loving tiff between brother and sister?

409
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,180
Long live the King!

410
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,240
A foreign woman stands at the doorstep.

411
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:24,760
- She desires an audience with the King.
- Let her in.

412
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,820
Why don't you show me
what you've brought me?

413
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:40,440
I've told you a hundred times I will.

414
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:42,460
Please sit down there.

415
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:45,750
Okay, here I am. Seated.

416
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,680
Thank you very much.

417
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,920
Now tell me what you've brought me.

418
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:55,290
The King and the Queen told me
to tie rakhi for the princes.

419
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,350
So I've brought a rakhi with me.

420
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,050
Then go ahead, tie it.

421
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,270
Tie it yourself.
Why should I tie it for you?

422
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,420
Then what will I tell the King?

423
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,360
How should I know?
Say whatever comes to your mind.

424
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,770
Who, Amar? Come, brother.

425
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:19,150
If I may, hearty congratulations!

426
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:22,250
Congratulations? To me?
Shouldn't they be for you?

427
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,520
For both of us.

428
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

429
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,060
So should I explain to you, big brother?

430
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,350
Congratulations to you
for getting a wife.

431
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,760
And to me for getting a sister-in-law.

432
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:35,900
You cannot fool me today, big brother.

433
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,550
Today I'm saying it, tomorrow
the whole town'll be talking about it.

434
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,650
So you are daughter of that country
where King Dara was ruler?

435
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,060
He was a friend of mine.

436
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,400
I regret that I could not
come to his aid.

437
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,470
Tell me, what can I do for you?

438
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,060
I have brought a gift
for the King of India.

439
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:05,470
And hope that the King will accept it.

440
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,360
I'll accept your gift with pleasure.

441
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,850
Then show me your hand.

442
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,670
You are scared?

443
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:17,360
No, I am just thinking.

444
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,570
What's there to think about?

445
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,950
It's easy to become brother-sister.

446
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,760
But it's not easy to honor
the essence of this relationship.

447
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:27,050
Then please think it over.

448
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,180
But please don't forget that
I've come all the way from Iran.

449
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:34,660
And I've come with the hope
of making the King of India my brother.

450
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,280
Okay, go ahead and tie it.

451
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,380
- From today you are my brother.
- From today you are my sister.

452
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:03,000
Today you've tied a rakhi
for me for the very first time.

453
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:05,150
Tell me what I should
give you in return.

454
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:08,990
I haven't made you my brother
for gold or silver.

455
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:12,650
In the country of Iran,
I have everything I need.

456
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,470
Even if the sister has
all the world's treasures...

457
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,160
it's the brother's duty to give her
a gift on the day of rakhi.

458
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:25,710
Tell the treasurer to arrange a thousand
gold coins and a palace for my sister.

459
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,326
A palace?

460
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:30,500
The King's sister cannot live
in an inn or a charity home.

461
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,120
What's my sister thinking about now?

462
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:42,050
I am wondering that you never
even asked me why I've come here.

463
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:47,150
The brother's conscience says:
"Don't ask such questions, you're Indian".

464
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:52,080
And the sister's conscience says:
"Tell him immediately. You're from Iran".

465
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,740
Then let the sister speak,
the brother will listen.

466
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:59,490
I've come here with the intention
of preventing any harm to Sikandar.

467
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,960
Are you regretting what
you've just accepted?

468
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,860
No, I'm just surprised.

469
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,790
If you want, I'll remove this right now.

470
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,450
When you tied this,
you became my sister.

471
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:17,000
Now by removing it,
you cannot become a stranger.

472
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,720
Long live the King!

473
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,400
King Totu.

474
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,600
King Virbahu.

475
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,680
King Ambhi.

476
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:38,970
Greece.

477
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:03,630
The Emperor believes all
have got their share.

478
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:08,210
Thanks to the Emperor's kindness,
nobody has missed out.

479
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:10,270
You lied to me.

480
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,020
I notice that the two of you
haven't received anything yet.

481
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:17,620
You will be punished for this lie.

482
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:21,760
And your punishment is...

483
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,790
this sword for you...

484
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:32,340
and, this one for you.

485
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:35,990
But the Emperor hasn't
kept anything for himself?

486
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:41,580
I've kept for myself that which cannot
be found in all the treasures of India.

487
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,400
I swear by God, our Emperor
is really the son of Jupiter.

488
00:49:55,190 --> 00:50:03,190
Seleucus, what did Puru say?

489
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,910
I wanted to tell you
about that tomorrow.

490
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:09,810
- Why not today?
- Today is the day of victory.

491
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,530
For Nicator,
every day is a day of victory.

492
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,510
Tell me what his reply was.

493
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,460
- May my life be spared.
- Your life will be spared!

494
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:22,460
Puru has said:
"I'll see you on the field of battle".

495
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,390
Jemenees, reserve the
best presents of Greece for him.

496
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:32,280
I like those who accept my terms.

497
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,860
But I respect those
who challenge me to a fight.

498
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,410
I respect a man who knows
how to fight in battle...

499
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:45,380
but I worship a man who knows
how to die on a battlefield.

500
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,000
No doubt a man's life is to live...

501
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:52,340
but sometimes moments
arise in a man's life...

502
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,030
when he becomes immortal in death.

503
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,680
And when he escapes alive,
he no longer lives.

504
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,990
Today that moment of reckoning
has arrived.

505
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:05,470
Sikandar thinks we're small and weak,
so he's attacked us.

506
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,710
But has he given us a reason
for attacking us?

507
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:11,400
He says,
"I want the entire world to bow before me".

508
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:14,360
And what about those
who refuse to bow before him?

509
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,430
He says those countries
have no right to exist.

510
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:21,150
He has fire in one hand,
and a sword in the other.

511
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:25,980
And every country that defies him
in his path, is razed to the ground.

512
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,290
Many countries have accepted defeat,
many have been destroyed.

513
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:32,430
Now it's our turn.

514
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,350
And he stands at our doorstep
and asks us "What's your stand?"

515
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,200
King Abhisar?

516
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:44,420
I believe that honor and bravery
is not the preserve of one man.

517
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:48,660
He has no right to threaten
or bully the rest of the world.

518
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,730
The King of Kulut,
what do you prefer?

519
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,030
A life of subjugation
or an honorable death?

520
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:57,170
I want a life of victory.

521
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,620
- And you, King of Salkot?
- We will fight.

522
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,820
- And you, King of Pashpat?
- We will win!

523
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,750
But it would be a mistake
to underestimate the enemy.

524
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:13,160
He is Sikandar.
He only knows to win, not to lose.

525
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:18,130
If we have God with us,
we'll teach him how to lose.

526
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:23,680
We'll teach him such a lesson
that he'll not dare come this way again.

527
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,330
But King Puru, you haven't
shared your views with us yet.

528
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,400
My view is that if anybody
is becoming a threat to world peace...

529
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:36,360
and wants to bring everybody
under his own control...

530
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:38,980
then it is the duty
of every man to challenge him.

531
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,670
Your view is completely correct.

532
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:44,500
Please go ahead, we are all with you.

533
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,840
Then come,
let's bury our differences for now.

534
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,800
Let's forget our domestic issues,
our problems with each other.

535
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,280
And let's first tackle that man...

536
00:52:54,610 --> 00:53:00,180
who wants to destroy our peace
in his quest for world sovereignty.

537
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:04,520
If we stay united,
then we will live and be victorious.

538
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:08,830
But if we don't,
we are assured of death and defeat.

539
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:12,410
May He give us life and victory!

540
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:25,340
May our country win!

541
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:34,090
India is our home

542
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,230
India is our world

543
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:42,610
We are the birds of this land

544
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,710
This land is our garden

545
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,330
May our country win!

546
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,630
Its feet are adorned by golden Lanka

547
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:10,730
Lakes adorn it like a pearl necklace

548
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:18,900
lts beauty is unique and enthralling

549
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:26,790
At the crest is the crown of the Himalayas

550
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,480
May our country win!

551
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:44,200
Awake, God of War!

552
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,460
Awake, be alert!

553
00:54:55,490 --> 00:55:00,670
Raise some fearsome storms from our land

554
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:06,330
Give us your courage

555
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:11,570
Spread our zeal across the land

556
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:13,980
Oh God!

557
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:20,390
May our country win!

558
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:28,630
God, You are our Father!

559
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,690
It is all in your hands

560
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:43,860
Show us the way, light a flame

561
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:51,070
It is a dark night tonight

562
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,650
You are our one support

563
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:05,650
May our country win!

564
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:42,530
Holy Fire, what can I ask from you?

565
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:48,490
If I ask for Sikandar's victory,
it will mean defeat for Puru.

566
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:54,140
And if I ask for Puru's victory,
it means defeat for Sikandar.

567
00:56:55,170 --> 00:57:00,030
Puru is my brother,
Sikandar is my beloved.

568
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:05,380
So I ask you to spare both their lives.

569
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,130
Save the honor of both.

570
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,890
Let both of them return
without losing face.

571
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:14,610
May our country win!

572
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:22,610
May our country win always

573
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:29,470
May the world sing our praises

574
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,290
The whole world will learn from us...

575
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:44,770
how to live and how to die

576
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:51,770
Our story will live on forever

577
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,350
May our country win!

578
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,000
It's been two months...

579
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:25,720
and not even one of our men
has been able to cross the river yet?

580
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:29,170
Seleucus, I want to know
the reason for this.

581
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:32,480
Your Highness, may your fame only increase!

582
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:34,440
But there has been a delay.

583
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,270
You call this a delay?

584
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,470
The Emperor considers this his defeat.

585
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,440
No opponent has ever
held out for so long against me.

586
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,090
Jemenees, what do you have to say?

587
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:46,780
Your Highness, this is the season of rains.

588
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:51,230
Don't try to hide your weakness
using rain as an excuse.

589
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:53,980
It's not the rain obstructing us.

590
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,980
It is the army of Puru
that isn't allowing us to progress.

591
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:04,910
As long as I'm alive,
there's no need for you to worry.

592
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:07,180
Your forces will advance.

593
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,300
The Emperor is pleased
to see such a show of courage.

594
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:20,870
And when the Emperor likes something
or finds something beautiful...

595
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:24,140
he calls it by its Greek name.

596
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:29,140
Till today, you were King Ambhi.
From today your name will be Amphis.

597
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,240
I will respect the name
given by the Emperor.

598
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:46,340
So Amphis,
is this Puru really all that brave a man?

599
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:52,130
The Emperor thinks
that before going to war...

600
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,160
he should see firsthand
how Puru rules his country.

601
00:59:55,470 --> 01:00:00,060
After the battle, he may
well escape but his country will not.

602
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,850
- But Nicator...
- No ifs, ands, or buts.

603
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:07,050
Your Nicator wants to see
who this man is...

604
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,430
who is made of such rock and steel...

605
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:13,050
that he refuses to be cowed
by storm or cyclone.

606
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,050
Men of such steel aren't born everyday.

607
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,770
In many centuries,
one such man is born.

608
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,050
Juminees, make arrangements.

609
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,010
The Emperor has decided
to cross the river.

610
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,490
Rexrees!

611
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:47,350
Today your Nicator is going
to meet lndia's bravest man.

612
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:54,930
If only you'd been here, I'd have
taken you also with me to meet him.

613
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:40,040
Attention, everybody!
The King's procession is approaching.

614
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,020
You who with a kind heart...

615
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:49,216
we hail everything you do.

616
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,216
You protect the honor
of even the poor...

617
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,320
the poor of the land hail you.

618
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,460
We hail your name,
we hail your deeds.

619
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,560
We hail your throne,
we hail your kingdom.

620
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:04,590
May you be blessed so, dear King.

621
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,520
May your rule be
hailed in all three worlds.

622
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:10,620
May your rule be hailed,
may your rule be hailed.

623
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:14,210
Bring the Greek envoy to the court.

624
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:09,460
On behalf of Nicator Alexander.

625
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,890
We welcome you.

626
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:28,700
- Do I have your permission?
- Yes, you do.

627
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:41,190
Nicator Alexander wishes King Puru
health and well being.

628
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:46,200
The King is informed
that the son of Jupiter, Alexander...

629
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,500
has set out to conquer the world.

630
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:53,510
But his kind heart does not wish
to see blood spilt in vain.

631
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:58,540
That is why he wishes that
King Ambhi and his allies...

632
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:01,920
surrender to Greece,
accepting its terms...

633
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:05,090
in the process,
saving their respective kingdoms.

634
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:09,090
In the same way, if you also accept
Alexander as supreme ruler...

635
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:14,710
then your rule and power
will be left as they are now.

636
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:17,270
You have only to pay
an annual fee of 200 elephants...

637
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:22,880
2,000 Indian swords
and 20,000 gold coins.

638
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:26,390
In return for this,
Alexander gives you the assurance...

639
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:29,360
that there will be no interference
with your rule.

640
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:33,350
Rather, if a third force
attacks your country...

641
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:36,700
Alexander's substantial forces
will protect you.

642
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:42,730
Messenger, go tell your Emperor that...

643
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,620
till now he's only seen Indian swords.

644
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:48,350
Now he will see Indian warriors too.

645
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:52,620
My Emperor has extended a hand
in friendship towards the King.

646
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:55,650
This is not a hand in friendship,
it is a hand claiming victory.

647
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:00,720
He wants us to be like slaves
on our knees, kissing his palm.

648
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,100
And he, like the master,
pats us on our backs.

649
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,820
Puru has only known to have
others bow before him.

650
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,850
He does not know to bow before others.

651
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,200
So what should I go tell him?

652
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:15,300
Tell him he has insulted me.

653
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:17,920
Our reply to this insult
will be with our swords.

654
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:21,430
I would like to once again
suggest with great respect...

655
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:25,300
that the King consider
the implications of his decision.

656
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:27,950
You are exceeding your brief, messenger!

657
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:30,570
But I forgive you.

658
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:40,120
Minister, send two rotis made of gold
and pearls for Sikandar through the envoy.

659
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:42,940
Rotis of gold?

660
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:46,910
Others hunger for rotis
of maize and millet.

661
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:51,900
Your Sikandar hungers for rotis
of gold, silver and jewelry.

662
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:57,040
If this weren't true, he wouldn't
go about destroying the entire world.

663
01:06:57,690 --> 01:07:01,830
Dear King, you are insulting
my Emperor in front of me.

664
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:04,860
But when you are
face to face with my Emperor...

665
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:07,900
you won't dare insult him
in this manner.

666
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:12,960
Whatever I'm saying,
I'm saying in front of your Emperor.

667
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,580
What's this you are saying?

668
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:21,480
I am saying that before me
is not a Greek messenger...

669
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:23,180
but Sikandar himself!

670
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,260
Can you deny this?

671
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:52,810
No, I do not deny it.

672
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:02,150
You have sharp eyes,
I compliment you on them.

673
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,350
We have very sharp swords too.

674
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:09,180
When I get to see how sharp they are,
I will compliment them too.

675
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,250
But right now, you should be
praising me for my courage.

676
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,690
That I chose to come to your court.

677
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:19,140
And if I tie up your courage and
throw you into a cell, then what?

678
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:24,860
The world will say Puru had a sharp eye,
but not a brave heart.

679
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,070
And if I give orders to kill you...

680
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:32,335
won't you regret your
courage goading you...

681
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:34,339
on to the biggest
mistake of your life?

682
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,370
If you kill me, you will be
the one regretting it.

683
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:41,469
That you have deprived this world
of its bravest man.

684
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:49,020
And have you considered what the world
will say if you get me killed?

685
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:52,090
You are anyway destroying world peace.

686
01:08:52,569 --> 01:08:56,879
To satisfy your own selfish desires,
you are destroying the whole world.

687
01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:00,670
Wherever you go,
you take devastation with you.

688
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,120
If the world doesn't object to your deeds,
why should it object to mine?

689
01:09:04,569 --> 01:09:08,359
It'll say "Puru killed Sikandar when
he was but a messenger in his court".

690
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,050
"This was a sign of his
cowardice and weakness".

691
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:13,529
When Sikandar, without reason...

692
01:09:13,939 --> 01:09:18,869
kills innocent citizens of Iran, Egypt
and Gandhar in their own homes...

693
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:21,589
he is called brave, courageous,
and a Nicator.

694
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:25,900
And if Puru, to protect his country's
honor and freedom, punishes the culprit...

695
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:28,009
he becomes a coward?

696
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:33,800
This may be justice in Greece,
not in the rest of the world.

697
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,620
After all, what has India taken of yours?

698
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:43,580
Have any of us snatched your bread,
your clothing, your self respect from you?

699
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:47,960
Or have any of us
curbed your freedom?

700
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:52,790
If the answer's no, how do you justify
trying to make India your slave?

701
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:57,370
The Emperor who dies without
expanding his kingdom is no Emperor.

702
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:01,650
And the Emperor who allows his
captured enemy to walk away free?

703
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:06,750
All I know is that for so many
to attack one person...

704
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:10,950
is such injustice
that no country will approve of it.

705
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:14,500
Not even your India.

706
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:17,020
And is there any country...

707
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:21,290
which will approve of Sikandar's attacks
on small and weak countries?

708
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:24,260
Is there any country in the world
which will say...

709
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,460
that deploying Sikandar's
army of 120,000...

710
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:31,390
against Puru's army of 30,000
is an act of bravery and valor?

711
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:35,460
Will you tell 90,000 of
your men to step aside?

712
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:38,870
That only 30,000 of your men
fight against 30,000 of mine?

713
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,140
While fighting Dara,
did you bother to check whether...

714
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:44,660
your troops didn't number
more than his troops?

715
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,180
If you didn't care then,
then why protest now?

716
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:49,900
When your gambit worked,
you killed your enemy.

717
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:52,730
So when your enemy's gambit works,
he will kill you.

718
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,860
Then give out orders.
Everyone in your court has a sword.

719
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:59,620
I would've gladly accepted your request.

720
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:02,930
And I would've shred you to pieces,
feeding you to the vultures.

721
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:06,820
But unfortunately you
have come as a messenger.

722
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:12,890
Commander, give Sikandar
due state protection...

723
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,470
and see that he crosses the river.

724
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:19,580
Your Highness, my intervention be excused,
but politics tells us...

725
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:24,880
that letting go of a captured enemy
is the same as accepting defeat.

726
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:30,230
But Indian politics tells us that
he who has come as a messenger...

727
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,980
should be treated only as a messenger.

728
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,570
You can go, Emperor,
you are a free man.

729
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:39,600
We will now meet only
on the battlefield.

730
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:42,810
And I hope that you will not
be a messenger at that time.

731
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,980
And I'll also not be alone.

732
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:49,980
King Puru, I have never paid
salute to anybody to date.

733
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:54,460
But you are a brave man
and I salute you.

734
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:58,530
Good bye, Greek Emperor, goodbye.

735
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:33,510
Bloom, beautiful flowers

736
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:37,470
Spring is here

737
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:03,600
Nature has whispered this
in the ears of rosebuds...

738
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,040
"Bloom, bloom"

739
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:22,760
Bloom, beautiful flowers.
Spring is here

740
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:30,860
Everything about this season is beautiful

741
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:37,030
The days are filled with songs,
the nights with stories

742
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:50,200
In this young, evergreen world...

743
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:58,120
there's green everywhere today

744
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:03,600
Bloom, bloom

745
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:13,080
Bloom, beautiful flowers.
Spring is here

746
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:24,870
The towns, paths, jungles,
gardens are fragrant

747
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:28,700
The very sight makes me sing aloud

748
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:39,900
Everybody's forehead
is being kissed by...

749
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,790
the blessing of youth

750
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,890
Bloom, bloom

751
01:14:54,060 --> 01:15:00,790
Bloom, beautiful flowers.
Spring is here

752
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:17,080
Prarthana?

753
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:22,330
Prince, what brings you
here at this time?

754
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:24,230
Sit down, Prarthana.

755
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,220
I want to say something to you.

756
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:34,430
But now I'm wondering
whether I should say it or not.

757
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:37,600
Then please first ponder on this.

758
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:42,940
The thing is Prarthana,
that nowadays I see a dream.

759
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:49,420
And that dream
is very pleasant and sweet.

760
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:53,930
I've discussed this dream
with the King also.

761
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:56,660
- You have?
- And he said...

762
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:00,000
"Go tell her about whom
you have this dream".

763
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,060
Okay.

764
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,440
You've understood
what this dream is?

765
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:12,300
- Yes.
- So what should I understand then?

766
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:14,820
Nothing,

767
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:17,680
Prarthana, you have
to give me an answer.

768
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:23,330
- I will not.
- I say you have to.

769
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,060
Ok, then you sit here.

770
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,260
Here I am. Seated.

771
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,920
Now close your eyes.

772
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:34,576
Ok, eyes closed.

773
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,050
- And don't open them until I tell you to do so.
- Okay.

774
01:17:30,930 --> 01:17:32,790
Prarthana! Prarthana!

775
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:41,680
- What's the matter, Amar?
- Nothing, Mother.

776
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:44,260
Mother knows everything.

777
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:47,020
You keep quiet.
You are the younger one.

778
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:51,120
Oh God, in my next birth
let me not be the younger one.

779
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,600
Everybody who wants to,
just bullies me.

780
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:01,050
What did she say? Yes or No?

781
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:06,630
Crazy boy! He's too shy
to talk to his own mother.

782
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:10,220
Mother, you can see
a smile on his lips.

783
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:11,906
That should tell you enough.

784
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:13,420
There's no need to ask him.

785
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:15,110
In other words, "yes".

786
01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:18,110
I had told the same to the King earlier.

787
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:20,900
The girl's like the moon,
the boy's like the sun.

788
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:22,590
It will be a good match.

789
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,930
Son, you should not now
see too much of Prarthana.

790
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:30,350
- That is our tradition.
- Say "As you wish, Mother".

791
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:45,030
There's a thief in the garden,
the gardener sleeps

792
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:05,050
Beware of these thieves

793
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,160
They are everywhere

794
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:16,080
The gardener sleeps

795
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:26,460
There's a thief in the garden,
the gardener sleeps

796
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:33,770
Other thieves look for darkness

797
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:40,970
They lurk in the shadows

798
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:48,210
These garden thieves are daring

799
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,480
For them the night is...

800
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,860
just like the brightness of day

801
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,160
The gardener sleeps

802
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:17,060
There is a thief in the garden,
the gardener sleeps

803
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:24,160
Other thieves steal silver...

804
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:31,500
gold, diamonds, precious pearls

805
01:20:35,390 --> 01:20:38,800
These garden thieves are dangerous

806
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:44,350
What to say of gold and silver

807
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,940
These take even your mind and body

808
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:56,620
The gardener sleeps

809
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:05,450
There is a thief in the garden,
the gardener sleeps

810
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:15,680
Jasram, do you know who Sukhmunia
is calling "a thief in the garden"?

811
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,170
What do I know?

812
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:23,060
I care about eating the fruit,
not counting how many grow on the tree.

813
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:29,130
Fool, why do you ask this young man?

814
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:34,880
Ask this wise man,
I'll tell you all you need to know.

815
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:41,570
He has gone grey
but he has can still pack a punch.

816
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:51,430
So who is the "thief in the garden"?

817
01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:56,010
If Sukhmunia sings this,
she's referring to Jasram.

818
01:21:56,620 --> 01:22:01,010
And if my wife sings this,
she's talking about me.

819
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:04,410
- That's a lie.
- That's the truth.

820
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:10,690
Why do you fight over it?
Just ask Sukhmunia.

821
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:14,660
The garden is India. And the thief
is the Greek Emperor, Sikandar.

822
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:16,730
He has come to destroy our peace.

823
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:19,350
And our people are just sleeping.

824
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:22,720
And here was Jasram,
thinking she was singing him a love song.

825
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,620
He who sings a love song in these
difficult times, commits a sin.

826
01:22:26,890 --> 01:22:29,340
And he who listens to such a song,
is also a sinner.

827
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:34,100
You've made a very profound
statement, Sukhmunia.

828
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:36,170
Forget your home and its comforts.

829
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,270
And march ahead to protect your country.

830
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:40,270
May you live long!

831
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:45,710
Take an oath you will sacrifice
your life but not your country's honor.

832
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:49,640
You don't worry.
I'll give up my life for my country.

833
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:53,020
That's easy to say.
Let me see it in action.

834
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:56,540
The storm is still some distance away.

835
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:01,570
Let it come closer.
Then see what we're all capable of.

836
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:47,750
We've covered part of the distance.
A small part still needs to be covered.

837
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:56,130
This is a sign from above, that the
time for waiting has now passed.

838
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:58,710
Today is the day to cross the river.

839
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:02,260
Attention!

840
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:05,430
The enemy should not cross the river!

841
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,640
Attention!

842
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:12,500
Attention!

843
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:18,020
The enemy should not
cross the river! Attention!

844
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:26,240
Attention! The enemy should not
cross the river! Attention! Attention!

845
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:33,040
The enemy should not
cross the river! Attention!

846
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:37,520
This light should be burning
all night long.

847
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:40,360
The soldiers should be on alert
all night long.

848
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:41,970
So that the enemy is distracted...

849
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:46,110
and the Emperor, with half his men,
can travel 20 miles and cross the river.

850
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:03,410
Attention! The enemy
should not cross the river!

851
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:11,820
Attention! Attention! The enemy
must not cross the river! Attention!

852
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:21,370
With the river like this, who
has the courage to even step into it?

853
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:29,160
Attention! The enemy must not
cross the river! Attention!

854
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:47,370
There, an enemy arrow has greeted us.

855
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,260
Long live Nicator Alexander!

856
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:57,470
King Amphis, now your Indian
troops will be in front.

857
01:27:57,510 --> 01:28:05,510
Long live Nicator Alexander!

858
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:12,010
Indian soldiers? Indian soldiers?

859
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:18,350
Trust me,
this is the army of King Visarg.

860
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:21,900
Amar, take 2,000 men with you.

861
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:25,250
If it's the army of King Visarg,
welcome it.

862
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:28,180
If it's Sikandar's army, fight it.

863
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:31,690
I have confidence in both your bravery,
and your intelligence.

864
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,760
Wait!

865
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:37,800
Such a big army! These aren't Visarg's
men, these are Sikandar's men.

866
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,830
Let them run. We will chase
them and finish off every man.

867
01:29:43,690 --> 01:29:47,800
They are more in number.
But we are brave. We will fight.

868
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:52,590
Pray and before you die,
kill as many of the enemy as you can.

869
01:30:05,130 --> 01:30:09,550
We are lucky. They are themselves
coming in the line of our arrows.

870
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:13,230
When they come, give way.

871
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:15,230
When they are in, surround them.

872
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:17,340
And mind you,
not one man should escape.

873
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:20,230
This is our first battle
this side of the river.

874
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:50,400
Amar! Amar! Amar, my son!

875
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:56,320
Who says that Amar is dead?

876
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,840
In his death,
he has only attained immortality.

877
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,360
And I am proud that he was my son.

878
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:07,390
He has protected my honor.

879
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:10,900
He has proved to be a
worthy son of his mother.

880
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:14,760
He has protected his country's honor.

881
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:25,070
I see that all of you are in mourning.

882
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:28,790
But remember what the prince said...

883
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:31,240
and go to the battlefield in good cheer.

884
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:35,100
May God bring you back
in good cheer too.

885
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,610
I know you are his mother.

886
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,920
But what's the point in weeping?

887
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:04,740
Weeping only causes us to become diffident.

888
01:33:05,810 --> 01:33:08,050
And right now what we need is courage.

889
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:10,430
Promise that you won't cry.

890
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:15,700
Ok, I will not cry.
I will not cry.

891
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:28,320
He was our enemy.
He has killed many of our soldiers.

892
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:30,720
But he was brave.

893
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:33,210
If he'd wanted,
he could've tried to escape.

894
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:35,690
And if he'd tried,
he might've succeeded.

895
01:33:36,330 --> 01:33:39,350
But he chose to be brave
and put his life at risk.

896
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:41,900
I salute him.

897
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:47,450
Give me your wishes, that I may prove
to be a worthy son to my mother.

898
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:51,550
My brother, I am very worried.

899
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:53,720
I wonder what will happen today.

900
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:56,496
I wonder who will win, who will lose.

901
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:58,570
Victory or defeat is just a game of life.

902
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:00,610
One shouldn't obsess
too much about them.

903
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:05,270
It is our duty to fight with the
full strength of our body and soul.

904
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:07,330
And leave the rest to God.

905
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:12,090
May God protect you.

906
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:15,370
May God protect our country.

907
01:34:17,010 --> 01:34:18,650
Prarthana, pray for my brother's welfare.

908
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:21,360
His welfare is more important
than the country's welfare.

909
01:34:21,810 --> 01:34:24,330
If he is there,
the country will be saved.

910
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:26,880
If he isn't, the country
will also not survive.

911
01:34:27,490 --> 01:34:29,630
In front of the country,
a king is nothing.

912
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,840
If the country is saved,
it will find more kings.

913
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:36,010
If the country loses,
the kings will become slaves.

914
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:38,220
I like what Prarthana says.

915
01:34:39,180 --> 01:34:41,800
Her love for me has made
a coward of my sister.

916
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:45,110
And I know the reason
for this cowardice.

917
01:34:45,690 --> 01:34:47,940
My sister is concerned
about Sikandar also.

918
01:34:51,970 --> 01:34:54,800
Prarthana, I am going to war.

919
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:57,450
And anything can happen in war.

920
01:34:58,090 --> 01:35:01,620
I may return in the evening,
celebrating a victory.

921
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,890
Or maybe tonight's moon doesn't get
to see me, it sees my dead body.

922
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:11,410
So if you have any desire,
tell me now.

923
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:13,130
I will fulfill it.

924
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:16,790
My only desire is that you
rid the country of its enemies.

925
01:35:17,430 --> 01:35:19,440
I will honor your desire.

926
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:22,790
Now what does my sister want?

927
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:28,990
All I want is that the purpose
of my coming here from Iran...

928
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:30,610
should be satisfied.

929
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:32,330
You mean Sikandar should win?

930
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:35,640
No! I don't care about victory or defeat.

931
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:38,600
I only want Sikandar to be alive.

932
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:44,590
I give you my word that Sikandar
will not die at my hands.

933
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:46,030
Why won't he die?

934
01:35:46,190 --> 01:35:48,190
He who has attacked us without cause...

935
01:35:48,630 --> 01:35:50,460
he who has killed my brother Amar...

936
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:54,010
he who has killed 2,000
of our soldiers in one night...

937
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:56,630
he who wants to defeat us
and make us his slaves...

938
01:35:57,250 --> 01:36:00,770
he whose eyes are on
our dignity and our wealth...

939
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:06,280
he who is a destroyer of peace
and has taken many innocent lives...

940
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:08,420
why should he not be
killed by your hands?

941
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:10,310
You want to know the reason?

942
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:23,070
Look at this. This is the rakhi
that Rukhsana has tied for Puru.

943
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:25,480
But if you look at it carefully...

944
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:29,720
you'll see this is the rakhi
that Iran has tied for India.

945
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:33,850
I regret that India could not
come to lran's aid.

946
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:37,270
But Puru will definitely come
to the aid of lran's daughter.

947
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:40,330
So this means you will
deliberately make your country lose?

948
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:45,500
He who deliberately causes
his country to lose, is an animal.

949
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:48,950
Rather, calling him an animal
is an insult to animals.

950
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:05,980
Prarthana wishes that I fight
for the country.

951
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:11,220
I've assured her I will sacrifice
my last drop of blood for the country.

952
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:15,080
Rukhsana wants Sikandar
to remain alive.

953
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:19,830
I've assured her too that Sikandar
will not die at my hands.

954
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:23,490
Now you tell me,
what do you want?

955
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:27,370
I don't want anything...

956
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:34,830
because what I want,
no power on earth can give me.

957
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:37,720
Sarita Rani, be calm.

958
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:43,340
May God give you life and victory.

959
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:06,740
Rukhsana, you did not apply paste
on your brother's forehead?

960
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:33,370
The battle has started.

961
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:37,240
The time for talk is over.

962
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:41,620
Father, the time for battle has arrived.
Give me your permission.

963
01:38:42,710 --> 01:38:47,380
I give you my permission.
Go, serve your country.

964
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:50,380
I will take care of myself.

965
01:38:52,890 --> 01:38:54,620
Mother, give me blessings.

966
01:38:55,580 --> 01:39:00,170
May you get an arrow here.
Not here.

967
01:39:16,330 --> 01:39:24,330
All you soldiers, today once again
you are being put to the test.

968
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:28,810
With fire in your hearts,
revolt in your eyes...

969
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:33,120
pray to the Gods and advance further.

970
01:39:33,810 --> 01:39:39,800
Let it be written in indelible print
in the annals of history...

971
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:46,210
that the world was meant
to fall at your feet.

972
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:50,830
In the skies, Jupiter is with you.

973
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:55,730
On Earth, Jupiter's son,
Alexander, is with you.

974
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:59,690
Long live Nicator Alexander!

975
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:08,410
Long live King Puru! Long live King Puru!
Long live King Puru!

976
01:40:10,030 --> 01:40:16,480
My men of steel, you are sons of those
brave men who knew how to fight...

977
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:19,610
but did not know how
to run away from a battlefield.

978
01:40:20,370 --> 01:40:22,270
You belong to that country...

979
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:29,300
that has never allowed its honor
or flag to be compromised.

980
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:34,370
And today an arrogant foreigner
comes to you and tells you...

981
01:40:34,810 --> 01:40:39,640
to compromise your flag,
otherwise he'll destroy you.

982
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:43,780
If you want to save your
and your country's honor...

983
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:47,700
if you want to respect
the honor of your ancestors...

984
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:51,630
then march ahead with the full strength
of your body and soul.

985
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:54,870
Even if you die,
make the enemy retrace his steps.

986
01:40:55,550 --> 01:41:00,490
Show the world that you know not
just to live for your country...

987
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,350
but to die for it too.

988
01:45:48,330 --> 01:45:50,530
Turn back!

989
01:45:51,570 --> 01:45:53,570
Shahru, advance!

990
01:47:39,110 --> 01:47:40,860
Keep moving forward, don't turn back.

991
01:47:41,230 --> 01:47:43,130
If we turn back,
there's only death for us.

992
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:27,130
"I give you my word that Sikandar
will not die at my hands".

993
01:51:20,830 --> 01:51:28,310
Long live Nicator Alexander!
Long live Nicator Alexander!

994
01:51:28,590 --> 01:51:33,930
Long live Nicator Alexander!
Long live Nicator Alexander!

995
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:36,930
Congratulations to the Emperor.
We have won.

996
01:51:37,170 --> 01:51:40,960
I am pleased.
Go bring King Puru to me.

997
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:57,810
We thank the gods in the skies
who helped us again.

998
01:51:58,570 --> 01:52:03,430
And we once again
came out true in this test.

999
01:52:04,290 --> 01:52:09,020
The Emperor respects the bravery
of every single soldier here.

1000
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:15,320
But more than that,
he respects those brave...

1001
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,980
who are not here today to celebrate.

1002
01:52:19,850 --> 01:52:25,080
But their spirit is watching us
even from the dead.

1003
01:52:25,770 --> 01:52:30,250
And happy at our victory.
Victory to Greece!

1004
01:52:30,820 --> 01:52:36,140
Victory to Greek soldiers!
Victory to Greek martyrs!

1005
01:52:40,890 --> 01:52:46,860
Long live Alexander!
Long live Nicator!

1006
01:52:53,170 --> 01:52:55,310
Your Highness, King Puru is here.

1007
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:11,400
Sikandar acknowledges his brave enemy.

1008
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:20,160
So, now you realize Alexander's strength?

1009
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,710
It took him only a day
to win victory over you.

1010
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:27,700
Not through strength did you
achieve victory, but through deceit.

1011
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:32,910
If you were so strong,
why didn't you cross the river in daytime?

1012
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:35,420
All's fair in love and war.

1013
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:40,970
Then is it also okay to kill an emperor
disguised as an envoy?

1014
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:43,700
You didn't do me a favor.

1015
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:46,390
You had confidence
in your own capabilities.

1016
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:48,590
And that turned out to be a mistake.

1017
01:53:49,050 --> 01:53:51,830
If I make this mistake
a million times and am made prisoner...

1018
01:53:52,330 --> 01:53:56,480
if I get another chance,
I'll still make this same mistake.

1019
01:53:58,170 --> 01:53:59,690
I have seen many rulers...

1020
01:54:00,210 --> 01:54:02,210
and also defeated many rulers...

1021
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:07,960
but, I swear by Jupiter, I've never
seen a ruler as brave as you.

1022
01:54:09,100 --> 01:54:11,100
I have also seen many emperors.

1023
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:13,820
And also defeated many emperors.

1024
01:54:14,650 --> 01:54:16,650
But I swear on the name
of my arrow and my sword...

1025
01:54:17,060 --> 01:54:19,990
I've never seen an emperor
as vain and shallow as you.

1026
01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:23,350
Speak with respect.

1027
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:26,440
You are talking to Jupiter's son
and the world's conqueror.

1028
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:29,060
Who are you?
Don't you even know...

1029
01:54:29,570 --> 01:54:33,300
that when two kings speak,
it's an insult to them to interupt?

1030
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:37,430
Had you been in my court,
I would have dismissed you for this.

1031
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:41,740
And told you to first learn the protocol
of royal court proceedings.

1032
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:44,630
Seleucus, what you did wasn't right.

1033
01:54:45,700 --> 01:54:48,120
Your Highness, I am sorry.

1034
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:53,770
I am happy at your outspokenness.
So tell me...

1035
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:56,390
how would you want to be treated?

1036
01:54:57,590 --> 01:55:00,520
Like a king should treat another king.

1037
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:03,710
Anything else you want to say?

1038
01:55:04,450 --> 01:55:08,420
Whatever I had to say,
I've said in my earlier reply.

1039
01:55:09,970 --> 01:55:14,450
Write these words of King Puru in gold,
and preserve them amongst my treasures.

1040
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:17,830
When I return to Greece,
I will show the people of Greece...

1041
01:55:18,930 --> 01:55:22,510
that the world contains even
such people who may lose in war...

1042
01:55:23,010 --> 01:55:24,510
but do not lose their courage.

1043
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:27,100
People who do not bow
their heads down, blaming fate.

1044
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:31,030
And whose sons fearlessly walk
into the throes of death.

1045
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:36,090
King Puru, I acknowledge
that you are a brave man.

1046
01:55:36,850 --> 01:55:41,400
So brave that no power in this world
can make you bow before it.

1047
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:44,970
I'm letting you go free.

1048
01:55:45,810 --> 01:55:47,500
I let your soldiers go free.

1049
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:49,950
I let your country be free again.

1050
01:55:50,540 --> 01:55:56,600
In addition, the area near Hydaspes
that we captured will be returned.

1051
01:55:57,530 --> 01:55:59,170
Seleucus, tell the soldiers to step back.

1052
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:05,980
But will we still be subjugated to you?

1053
01:56:07,180 --> 01:56:09,770
In India,
you will be my biggest friend.

1054
01:56:10,420 --> 01:56:12,780
And in the annals of Greek history,
your name will be Porus.

1055
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:16,420
For the second time,
I offer you my hand in friendship.

1056
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:19,520
In return,
Puru offers his hand in love.

1057
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:22,560
Long live Nicator Alexander!

1058
01:56:23,730 --> 01:56:28,480
Long live King Porus!

1059
01:56:34,100 --> 01:56:38,140
King Amphis,
you did not cheer King Porus?

1060
01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:42,060
I do not want my friends
to be enemies with each other.

1061
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:46,550
You also should say
"Long live King Porus!".

1062
01:56:49,030 --> 01:56:50,820
Long live King Porus!

1063
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:59,470
Long live King Puru! Long live King Puru!
Long live King Puru!

1064
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:31,770
This is a splendorous night, my love

1065
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:47,900
I could stay awake
every moment of this night

1066
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:57,440
I could die for this night

1067
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:08,230
When do such nights come along?

1068
01:58:13,090 --> 01:58:19,950
This is a splendorous night, my love

1069
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:35,290
In this silvery night, I burn

1070
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:44,420
I walk on the streets of azure

1071
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:55,070
Sweet nectar fills my body

1072
01:58:59,730 --> 01:59:06,030
This is a splendorous night, my love

1073
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:21,230
In this silvery night, songs bloom

1074
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:29,820
Dreams are being made
in the silver gardens

1075
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:40,190
What a beautiful, clear,
and pleasant night this is

1076
01:59:44,670 --> 01:59:50,770
This is a splendorous night, my love

1077
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:03,150
Your husband has returned from war.

1078
02:00:03,450 --> 02:00:04,910
Welcome him with traditional honors.

1079
02:00:13,310 --> 02:00:15,550
What is this you're
mumbling to yourself?

1080
02:00:16,620 --> 02:00:18,350
I am praying to God that...

1081
02:00:18,830 --> 02:00:22,240
in my next birth too I should
get a brave husband like you.

1082
02:00:22,790 --> 02:00:26,550
Ok, I have accepted your prayer.

1083
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:30,960
In your next birth also,
I will be your husband.

1084
02:00:33,860 --> 02:00:35,960
Come on, let it be.

1085
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:38,440
Who welcomes an old man
with traditional honors?

1086
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:42,300
Even if a man is old,
he is still his woman's husband.

1087
02:00:42,750 --> 02:00:46,300
I do speak to you in a loud voice,
it doesn't mean I fight with you.

1088
02:00:48,660 --> 02:00:52,880
Brothers, today the honor of our country
and our king has been saved.

1089
02:00:53,430 --> 02:00:55,020
This is an occasion for celebration.

1090
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:57,400
Light up lamps in every household.

1091
02:00:57,670 --> 02:00:59,080
Wait a moment!

1092
02:01:00,770 --> 02:01:03,010
Had this really been a happy occasion...

1093
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:06,050
the palace would have been
glittering with light.

1094
02:01:06,610 --> 02:01:08,080
But I have just been there.

1095
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:12,880
Both outside and inside the palace
there is complete darkness.

1096
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:15,600
What is the reason for this darkness?

1097
02:01:16,210 --> 02:01:19,180
For a defeated soldier,
darkness is his biggest reward.

1098
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:22,830
But you have not lost.
This is your victory.

1099
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:26,690
That's what you say.
But I say this is as good as my death.

1100
02:01:27,140 --> 02:01:29,300
Rather, it would have been better
if I had been killed.

1101
02:01:29,590 --> 02:01:31,790
At least the world would not say
that Puru was defeated.

1102
02:01:32,310 --> 02:01:34,790
He who says that Puru lost, is blind.

1103
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,070
In that case, the whole world is blind.

1104
02:01:37,550 --> 02:01:40,030
Using this logic, the generations
to come will also be blind.

1105
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:43,510
Because they'll also read history books
and say that Puru was defeated.

1106
02:01:44,170 --> 02:01:46,820
History records what happened
out there in broad daylight.

1107
02:01:47,370 --> 02:01:50,410
It does not record what happened
in the darkness of homes.

1108
02:01:51,020 --> 02:01:54,580
Apart from me, who knows that you'd
extracted a promise from Puru?

1109
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:59,820
That promise prevented Puru from killing
Alexander when he had the chance?

1110
02:02:00,750 --> 02:02:06,800
History will only say Alexander
won and he let Puru free.

1111
02:02:06,980 --> 02:02:10,400
You are right.
This is all my fault.

1112
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:15,670
I was also a big fool, to make such
a promise without a second thought.

1113
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:17,600
So is another promise
being made here or what?

1114
02:02:17,650 --> 02:02:19,100
You go away from here.

1115
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:21,910
I don't want anybody
to see my disgraced face.

1116
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:23,910
And it's alright
for Rukhsana to see it?

1117
02:02:24,660 --> 02:02:28,940
Rukhsana can see it, because she's
the one who's caused this disgrace.

1118
02:02:31,390 --> 02:02:34,840
Tell me what I should do.
I'm willing to do anything.

1119
02:02:35,260 --> 02:02:37,660
I've committed a grave crime against you.

1120
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:40,420
- Now you're saying it.
- So far only Puru has been defeated.

1121
02:02:40,730 --> 02:02:43,380
In a few days,
the rest of India will also be defeated.

1122
02:02:43,450 --> 02:02:47,240
Sikandar's forces will keep advancing
and capturing India.

1123
02:02:47,830 --> 02:02:51,240
That will be the end
of lndia's independence.

1124
02:02:51,450 --> 02:02:53,520
That will not be the end
of lndia's independence.

1125
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:56,100
That will be the end
of Sikandar's bravery.

1126
02:02:56,760 --> 02:02:59,070
The people beyond the river Beas
are not as foolish as I.

1127
02:02:59,620 --> 02:03:01,720
They will fight the Greek army
tooth and nail.

1128
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:05,130
It is also possible that Sikandar
is killed in battle there.

1129
02:03:05,660 --> 02:03:08,990
But I've heard that,
seeing your bravery...

1130
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:11,316
Sikandar's army has refused
to advance further into India.

1131
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:15,130
The soldiers have refused,
but Sikandar hasn't, has he?

1132
02:03:15,950 --> 02:03:18,350
Sikandar only has to give them
a short motivational speech...

1133
02:03:18,850 --> 02:03:21,230
and they'll regain all
their enthusiasm and energy.

1134
02:03:22,370 --> 02:03:24,190
Sikandar will think of that as his victory.

1135
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:27,260
But this victory will actually
turn out to be his defeat.

1136
02:03:32,980 --> 02:03:34,770
He will not cross the Beas!

1137
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:36,880
He will not cross the Beas!

1138
02:03:37,260 --> 02:03:39,010
He will not cross the Beas!

1139
02:03:42,660 --> 02:03:46,800
This mad woman says,
he will not cross the Beas.

1140
02:03:48,180 --> 02:03:50,970
But he will cross even the Ganges.

1141
02:03:51,390 --> 02:03:53,450
Who will cross even the Ganges?

1142
02:03:54,870 --> 02:04:00,310
My Amar, who else?
Have you forgotten Amar so soon?

1143
02:04:01,660 --> 02:04:05,210
You are the father,
you can forget him.

1144
02:04:06,330 --> 02:04:10,380
But I am his mother, I can never forget.

1145
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:16,820
It is true that we are soldiers.

1146
02:04:17,010 --> 02:04:20,170
It is also true that soldiers
do not refuse to follow orders.

1147
02:04:20,350 --> 02:04:22,030
But soldiers also have eyes.

1148
02:04:22,060 --> 02:04:23,460
And those eyes see.

1149
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:27,130
And based on what they see,
they tell us the truth.

1150
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:29,160
Nobody should be blind on purpose.

1151
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:30,986
We are not blind. We are not blind.

1152
02:04:31,010 --> 02:04:32,356
But we are being blinded.

1153
02:04:32,380 --> 02:04:35,750
Do we realize that Porus
has wiped out half our troops?

1154
02:04:35,820 --> 02:04:37,446
And weakened the resolve
of the other half.

1155
02:04:37,470 --> 02:04:40,500
If you search among your brave men,
you'll find a fear of Porus.

1156
02:04:40,690 --> 02:04:43,880
And it is not just we who fear Porus.
Even our Emperor fears him.

1157
02:04:44,010 --> 02:04:46,290
Otherwise he would never
have reconciled with him.

1158
02:04:46,910 --> 02:04:50,120
It is indeed true that Porus
is no ordinary man, he is a god.

1159
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:53,390
Remember all that he said
that day in the court?

1160
02:04:53,940 --> 02:04:55,420
Nicator Alexander swallowed all that.

1161
02:04:55,980 --> 02:04:59,700
We've been told that 40,000 of our troops
have been sent back to Iran and Greece.

1162
02:05:00,050 --> 02:05:02,840
But I say this is the biggest lie
in the annals of Greek history.

1163
02:05:03,250 --> 02:05:05,650
These 40,000 men have been killed
in the war with Porus' men.

1164
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:08,210
And our Nicator is hiding
this truth from us.

1165
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:10,250
This is very true.

1166
02:05:10,280 --> 02:05:13,630
I have seen with my own eyes,
when our court was in progress...

1167
02:05:13,900 --> 02:05:17,970
the bodies of our men were being burnt
together with those of Hindus.

1168
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:19,730
And now we're being told...

1169
02:05:19,830 --> 02:05:22,720
that 40,000 soldiers have been
given leave to go home.

1170
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,690
Are we to understand that
tomorrow when we are killed...

1171
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:30,760
a plaque with our names will be made
and will say "these were given leave"?

1172
02:05:31,410 --> 02:05:34,510
All this is fine,
but what can we do?

1173
02:05:34,890 --> 02:05:36,350
We are weak and powerless.

1174
02:05:37,190 --> 02:05:39,170
Who says you are weak and powerless?

1175
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:41,820
You have won for Sikandar
every single battle of his.

1176
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:44,230
Who says you don't
have an identity of your own?

1177
02:05:44,580 --> 02:05:47,060
Sikandar derives all his strength from you.

1178
02:05:47,370 --> 02:05:49,640
Who says that your voice
will have no impact?

1179
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:52,500
Sikandar cannot walk
one step without you.

1180
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:56,190
Tell him you are tired of this life
of spear and sword.

1181
02:05:56,610 --> 02:05:58,880
Tell him that your hearts
now yearn for peace.

1182
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:01,500
Tell him your families
are calling you back home.

1183
02:06:02,050 --> 02:06:03,710
Tell him you will not advance further.

1184
02:06:03,740 --> 02:06:11,320
We will not advance further!
We will not advance further!

1185
02:06:16,840 --> 02:06:20,110
Send us back home!
Send us back home!

1186
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:23,700
We will not advance further!

1187
02:06:31,940 --> 02:06:36,140
The time for rest and relaxation is over.
We need to resume our mission.

1188
02:06:38,170 --> 02:06:41,450
- King Amphis?
- Yes?

1189
02:06:42,620 --> 02:06:44,140
How are you going to help me?

1190
02:06:44,580 --> 02:06:47,440
My army and I are both at your disposal.

1191
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,620
I am pleased to hear that.
It is what I was expecting.

1192
02:06:53,130 --> 02:06:56,300
And King Porus, my friend?
What about you?

1193
02:06:57,100 --> 02:07:00,440
I'm afraid you are not
going to like my answer.

1194
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:02,640
So is the king not going to help me?

1195
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:04,510
The king is my friend!

1196
02:07:04,780 --> 02:07:08,500
I am your friend only later,
I am first a son of this soil.

1197
02:07:09,030 --> 02:07:12,160
Bravo! I am disappointed
in your answer...

1198
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:14,430
but I respect your patriotism.

1199
02:07:17,150 --> 02:07:19,840
I will pray for your life, for sure.

1200
02:07:21,570 --> 02:07:24,220
- And not for my victory?
- No.

1201
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:27,290
Because your victory
means defeat for my country.

1202
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:32,600
The man who prays for his country's
defeat, or helps in such cause...

1203
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:36,800
is no man, but an animal.
In fact, he is worse than that.

1204
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:39,560
Because even an animal
does not pray for its own defeat.

1205
02:07:39,970 --> 02:07:42,940
Puru, you've insulted me.
I challenge you to a sword fight.

1206
02:07:44,110 --> 02:07:48,180
I'm glad that my neighbor's blood
is not entirely water.

1207
02:07:50,550 --> 02:07:51,950
Wait!

1208
02:07:54,870 --> 02:07:56,330
You are my friends.

1209
02:07:57,270 --> 02:08:00,170
I don't want you wasting your energies
fighting each other.

1210
02:08:03,070 --> 02:08:06,410
King Amphis,
I'm going to ask you something.

1211
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:09,130
And you know I don't take
no for an answer.

1212
02:08:09,370 --> 02:08:12,170
And I don't know how
to say no to you.

1213
02:08:13,430 --> 02:08:19,370
I want you to get your sister, Prarthana,
married to King Porus' son, Samarpal.

1214
02:08:23,780 --> 02:08:28,260
- So you agree?
- Who can refuse Sikandar's request?

1215
02:08:28,430 --> 02:08:31,190
Then put away your swords.
You are related now.

1216
02:08:31,990 --> 02:08:37,880
Seleucus, tell the men to get ready.
We will now advance.

1217
02:08:38,170 --> 02:08:41,670
We will not advance.
We will not advance.

1218
02:08:42,050 --> 02:08:45,700
We want to go home.
We want to go home.

1219
02:08:45,910 --> 02:08:49,290
Send us back home.
Send us back home.

1220
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:18,270
Long live Nicator Alexander!

1221
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:24,370
Have the rules of loyalty changed today?

1222
02:09:24,810 --> 02:09:27,480
You cannot even wish me
a long life today?

1223
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:36,370
The Emperor has always heard only
shouts of loyalty from you men.

1224
02:09:37,190 --> 02:09:41,810
But today the Emperor senses
revolt and disobedience.

1225
02:09:42,640 --> 02:09:45,810
I do not take kindly to disobedience.

1226
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:48,530
What do you want from me, after all?

1227
02:09:53,570 --> 02:09:56,190
Tell me, what do you want from me?

1228
02:09:56,670 --> 02:09:58,320
We don't want anything, Your Highness.

1229
02:09:59,110 --> 02:10:02,430
If you want nothing,
why are you assembled here?

1230
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:05,180
We want to go home.

1231
02:10:05,850 --> 02:10:07,630
Say "I want to go home".

1232
02:10:08,150 --> 02:10:09,560
We want to go home.

1233
02:10:10,250 --> 02:10:15,830
Yes, we want to go home.

1234
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:20,900
I now realise for the first time that
I've got a bunch of weaklings in my army.

1235
02:10:21,550 --> 02:10:27,550
Being miles away from home, they've
forgotten their duty towards their country.

1236
02:10:28,210 --> 02:10:29,630
We know our duty.

1237
02:10:29,830 --> 02:10:31,480
And we have always fulfilled our duty.

1238
02:10:31,790 --> 02:10:34,450
But it's been fourteen years
since we left home.

1239
02:10:34,890 --> 02:10:38,370
Our families wake up each morning
with hope that we'll return that day...

1240
02:10:38,550 --> 02:10:40,410
and go to sleep each night, disappointed.

1241
02:10:40,750 --> 02:10:42,790
We have a responsibility towards them too.

1242
02:10:43,170 --> 02:10:47,580
So, with great respect, we request
that we be allowed to go home.

1243
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:51,330
To tell your families that you've
returned home as failures?

1244
02:10:51,530 --> 02:10:55,296
We are not failures.
We've fought wars. And won them.

1245
02:10:55,320 --> 02:10:56,990
Who says we have won wars?

1246
02:10:58,590 --> 02:11:06,590
These are the people
who the Emperor is proud of.

1247
02:11:07,880 --> 02:11:14,320
These are the men whose names will be
recorded in Greek history for posterity.

1248
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:19,770
My brave men, just think...

1249
02:11:20,770 --> 02:11:24,910
When you left Greece,
you were just a stream.

1250
02:11:25,420 --> 02:11:28,110
Today you are a splashing river.

1251
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,970
And if you keep advancing like this...

1252
02:11:31,450 --> 02:11:34,490
tomorrow you will be an ocean.

1253
02:11:35,380 --> 02:11:36,930
You won victory over Iran.

1254
02:11:37,490 --> 02:11:39,070
You won victory over Turan.

1255
02:11:39,310 --> 02:11:40,800
You won victory over Egypt.

1256
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,280
You won victory over Babul and Gandhar.

1257
02:11:43,860 --> 02:11:49,690
And now, when on the verge of winning over
the land which grows gold and silver...

1258
02:11:50,140 --> 02:11:51,960
whose oceans have pearls...

1259
02:11:52,290 --> 02:11:53,930
whose forests have sandalwood...

1260
02:11:54,440 --> 02:11:56,240
whose soil has saffron...

1261
02:11:56,860 --> 02:12:02,960
when this land is ready
to fall at your feet...

1262
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:06,890
a land which even the
sun and moon envy...

1263
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:11,680
then love for your home
has suddenly developed in your hearts?

1264
02:12:12,370 --> 02:12:15,740
This love for your home is just
another name for cowardice.

1265
02:12:16,130 --> 02:12:17,710
Get rid of this cowardice.

1266
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:21,260
And rekindle that spark
of bravery in you and say...

1267
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:24,090
"We will advance further".

1268
02:12:24,570 --> 02:12:26,330
But what is the point
in advancing further...

1269
02:12:26,430 --> 02:12:28,530
when, after fighting Porus,
we've come to realize...

1270
02:12:28,680 --> 02:12:31,000
that beyond this,
we've even stronger enemies to deal with?

1271
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:34,390
So should we advance only
to be annihilated in this foreign land?

1272
02:12:34,770 --> 02:12:36,770
And there not be anybody
to even mourn our deaths?

1273
02:12:37,150 --> 02:12:41,250
Are we to advance only so you can
build your palaces on our graves?

1274
02:12:41,730 --> 02:12:44,940
Why should we, thousands of men,
sacrifice our lives...

1275
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:47,660
to satisfy this crazy ambition of yours?

1276
02:12:48,040 --> 02:12:49,460
Because you are soldiers.

1277
02:12:50,280 --> 02:12:53,420
And it is the duty of every soldier
to listen to his superior's orders...

1278
02:12:53,860 --> 02:12:55,260
and follow the orders.

1279
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:58,000
So have we not been
following your orders?

1280
02:12:58,180 --> 02:13:02,070
Haven't we been facing up to death
every single time on your orders?

1281
02:13:02,620 --> 02:13:05,760
Haven't we been sacrificing our lives,
winning for you half the world?

1282
02:13:06,270 --> 02:13:10,100
Do you want even the wind now
to blow only with your permission?

1283
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:14,230
Do you want even the river now
to flow only with your permission?

1284
02:13:14,610 --> 02:13:18,340
Do you want the whole world
should surrender to you?

1285
02:13:18,850 --> 02:13:21,510
But Your Highness, the world
is a very big place.

1286
02:13:21,980 --> 02:13:27,680
No one man, however great,
can be master of all elements of the world.

1287
02:13:29,740 --> 02:13:32,050
Fear the wrath of the god
of the skies, Jupiter.

1288
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:35,880
You are offending the son of Jupiter.

1289
02:13:36,350 --> 02:13:39,090
We don't want to offend
the son of Jupiter.

1290
02:13:39,370 --> 02:13:41,260
All we want is to go home.

1291
02:13:41,430 --> 02:13:45,670
We want to go home!
We want to go home!

1292
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:49,490
Then go!
And tell your families that...

1293
02:13:50,010 --> 02:13:53,250
you've left your Nicator
behind in enemy territory.

1294
02:13:54,010 --> 02:13:57,730
So that he gets disgraced
and dies in anonymity.

1295
02:14:39,690 --> 02:14:42,090
Till today, I have never faced
defeat from anybody.

1296
02:14:42,930 --> 02:14:45,470
But today my own men
have defeated me.

1297
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:50,470
Juminees, what will the world say?

1298
02:14:50,900 --> 02:14:53,670
What will the annals of history say?
What will future generations say?

1299
02:15:03,460 --> 02:15:04,920
But I have decided on one thing.

1300
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:09,080
Go, prepare the offerings
for my father, Jupiter.

1301
02:15:09,530 --> 02:15:12,220
If he accepts the offerings,
my soldiers will come with me.

1302
02:15:13,150 --> 02:15:15,560
If he does not,
I will also go back with them.

1303
02:15:16,350 --> 02:15:18,631
Let the world see it as if
my father, Jupiter, refused me.

1304
02:15:20,590 --> 02:15:22,870
My father, Jupiter, must save my honor.

1305
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:10,300
Father Jupiter, your son Alexander wants
your permission to advance further.

1306
02:16:12,910 --> 02:16:15,430
Give him a sign through Nature.

1307
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:30,740
Alexander! Father Jupiter is not
happy with you.

1308
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:36,050
He has rejected your offerings.
You cannot proceed!

1309
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:31,640
- Rukhsana!
- Your Highness!

1310
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:41,020
Long live Nicator Alexander!

1311
02:18:41,879 --> 02:18:47,219
Alexander, in front of father Jupiter,
you've embraced this woman.

1312
02:18:47,629 --> 02:18:49,939
So, according to the laws
of the gods...

1313
02:18:50,250 --> 02:18:52,460
she is your wife and
you are her husband.

1314
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:58,560
Long live Alexander!

1315
02:18:59,110 --> 02:19:02,350
Seleucus, let the wish of
father Jupiter be respected.

1316
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:04,830
Divide the troops into two battalions.

1317
02:19:05,450 --> 02:19:08,180
One will go back with you
via one route.

1318
02:19:08,969 --> 02:19:12,039
The other will go back with me
via another route.

1319
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:54,500
Life exists because of love,
let it be spent in love

1320
02:19:54,710 --> 02:19:58,470
At the feet of beauty,
give up your heart...

1321
02:19:58,710 --> 02:20:00,740
give up your life

1322
02:20:00,790 --> 02:20:02,740
Life exists due to love

1323
02:20:02,810 --> 02:20:04,630
Beauty is here in its prime

1324
02:20:04,830 --> 02:20:06,730
This moment is priceless

1325
02:20:10,900 --> 02:20:14,660
I am singing now,
you should sing too

1326
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:20,590
Let us sing together

1327
02:20:20,830 --> 02:20:24,726
Life exists because of love,
let it be spent in love

1328
02:20:24,750 --> 02:20:28,970
At the feet of beauty,
give up your heart...

1329
02:20:29,070 --> 02:20:31,040
give up your life

1330
02:20:31,090 --> 02:20:33,050
Life exists because of love

1331
02:20:33,170 --> 02:20:37,140
Life is for one night,
embrace this darkness

1332
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:44,960
Be like the moon,
and spread moonlight everywhere

1333
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:50,860
Serve everyone the nectar of love

1334
02:20:51,100 --> 02:20:55,100
Life exists because of love,
let it be spent in love

1335
02:20:55,210 --> 02:20:58,890
At the feet of beauty,
give up your heart...

1336
02:20:59,170 --> 02:21:01,100
give up your life

1337
02:21:01,180 --> 02:21:03,130
