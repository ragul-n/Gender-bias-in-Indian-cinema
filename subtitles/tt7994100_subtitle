1
00:00:00,608 --> 00:00:03,987
Smoking is injurious to health.

2
00:00:04,878 --> 00:00:07,338
It causes cancer.

3
00:00:08,635 --> 00:00:10,945
Smoking is injurious to health.

4
00:00:11,608 --> 00:00:13,243
It causes cancer.

5
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:09,127
Dear, Roshni and Raja,

6
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:13,412
Though these days letters
are out of vogue but could not

7
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:19,452
resist the temptation of inviting
you by letter on the occasion

8
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:21,518
of 50th marriage anniversary

9
00:01:21,817 --> 00:01:25,425
of your mother and me, the July, we
plan to celebrate that special day

10
00:01:25,898 --> 00:01:27,830
at our ancestral house, Komolini.

11
00:01:28,303 --> 00:01:30,533
50 years back, I had brought
your mother

12
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,775
to Komolini as a newly wed wife.

13
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:41,682
At this age, what remains are the
past reminiscences.

14
00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:45,613
Roshni is yet to visit our
ancestral house.

15
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,047
These days one always feels that
our remaining days are numbered.

16
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:54,183
The rest has assured us that they

17
00:01:54,303 --> 00:01:57,480
will come since they all live
within the country.

18
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:02,223
So it depends on you to

19
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,548
fulfil our dearest wish and make
that occasion complete.

20
00:02:06,398 --> 00:02:07,965
As always our

21
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:12,355
blessings and love for the two
of you.

22
00:02:13,588 --> 00:02:14,885
Yours, dad.

23
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:57,427
Left.

24
00:03:57,657 --> 00:04:00,588
More. No. Not that much.

25
00:04:02,115 --> 00:04:03,697
Why don't you get it?

26
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:05,048
No!

27
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:09,155
Why don't you get it?
Come here. Look from here.

28
00:04:09,402 --> 00:04:12,428
Do you see which side
is off kilter?

29
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:13,888
It's crooked!

30
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,402
Will you shut up? Stop poking
your nose into everything!

31
00:04:18,118 --> 00:04:20,862
Phatik!
- Hang on, sister-in-law.

32
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:22,308
Now, what's up?

33
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,592
You're off again. Fix this
before you go anywhere.

34
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:27,497
I will go after I do it.

35
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:31,038
First, make this right.
Then get the big painting

36
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:35,118
from that room and hang it
on the outside wall.

37
00:04:35,238 --> 00:04:37,687
Phatik! Where are you?

38
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:42,388
Didn't I tell you to get

39
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,388
the stuff out from the chest?

40
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:49,105
They will come here.
- Now, before you rush off,

41
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,363
go fetch the painting and hang
them on the outside wall.

42
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:55,525
Really! On the outside wall?
- Yes.

43
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:02,255
Alright, off you go.

44
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:03,687
Hey, you.

45
00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:06,105
Hey. Yes, you. Come down here.
- Me?

46
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:07,795
Come here and do this.

47
00:05:08,148 --> 00:05:10,563
They can't hang a damn
picture straight.

48
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,620
Mom, please see to it he's
in bed by nine.

49
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:15,815
You take care.

50
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:18,653
Tell the driver not to drive
like a maniac. - Okay.

51
00:05:19,082 --> 00:05:21,060
And don't be too late.
- No, we won't.

52
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,018
Mom, get ice-cream for me.

53
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:26,345
Okay. But only if you don't
bother grandma. - Okay.

54
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:28,990
Dad, you too.
- Sure!

55
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,975
Just like his mother.
- Bye.

56
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:33,147
Always ordering!
- Well! Blame it on me.

57
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:42,275
Keep the sweets.

58
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:44,490
Careful!

59
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,595
Did you get the sweets
from Surja Modak's?

60
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,675
Could you get the jolbhora?
- Yeah!

61
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,157
If there an India-wide competition,

62
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:06,055
Surja Modak would rank first.
- Okay. Let's go.

63
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:08,973
Have you become their spokesperson?

64
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,930
It's not that.

65
00:06:11,752 --> 00:06:14,518
Please put the AC on.
- Why do you need AC?

66
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:18,443
AC will cost more.
- We don't need AC then.

67
00:06:18,703 --> 00:06:20,875
We can just roll down
the window pane.

68
00:06:22,323 --> 00:06:24,940
What is this? This one doesn't
roll down? - That doesn't work.

69
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,750
Why don't you roll down that one?
- No way!

70
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:29,965
I have shampooed today
my hair. It will get messy.

71
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:31,435
Nothing will happen.
Let some fresh air in.

72
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:33,145
No. - Let some fresh air in.
We won't need AC.

73
00:06:34,203 --> 00:06:35,338
Strange.

74
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:40,440
Tublu. I am taking these two along.

75
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:43,100
Why?

76
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:48,570
You are not wearing these
fine clothes on the way there.

77
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:51,370
What am I suppose to wear?

78
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,068
Well, they said that we have
to wear Bengali outfits.

79
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,878
Am I back in school?

80
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,953
People are coming from far away.

81
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:07,293
It will be a close-knit family
affair. That's why...

82
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:11,963
Are we from near or far?

83
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:14,935
Just because we live close by
doesn't mean...

84
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't start again.

85
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,832
In that case, I will go on my own.

86
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,188
Just one evening is all there is to
it. Don't make a big deal please.

87
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:28,620
Order has been place.
You can't just say no.

88
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,577
I am saying no. That's it.

89
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:34,068
What do you mean?
- Don't argue with me. Fifty years

90
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,777
and we can't get flowers?

91
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,513
What's going on here?

92
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:40,223
This man is driving me nuts
with these marigolds.

93
00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:41,668
What are we going to do with these?

94
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:45,518
He asked me to get flowers from
wherever I could. Now, he says, no.

95
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,450
And so you got marigolds?

96
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:50,807
See, Hari gave us these
Rajanigandhas.

97
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:52,515
I am going to lose money
on this, ma'am.

98
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,337
Where did these ugly vases
descend from?

99
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:58,115
Maybe you can offer these
to the gods?

100
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:02,475
Okay, Phatik will take care
of how much you owe.

101
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:05,342
Well, Phatik, there weren't any
vases less ugly anywhere?

102
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:06,790
These will be in the living room

103
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:09,277
besides the main entrance.

104
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:12,920
I understand but these
are very ugly.

105
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:15,115
Joga doesn't have any
that are better looking.

106
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,098
If I knew about this,
I would brought some from my home.

107
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,678
Do this. Get us two good quality
earthen pitchers. Go on, now!

108
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:25,968
May I say something?

109
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:30,358
I know someone who has recently
started a decorator business.

110
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:32,498
Everything he has
is all new and shiny.

111
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:35,245
Should I get it from there?
- Earthen pitchers.

112
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:39,643
What are you still doing here?

113
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:43,210
I really like Ranga uncle.

114
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:46,325
He is so rich but doesn't
show it, no?

115
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,460
And his wife, at her age,
looks stunning.

116
00:08:53,318 --> 00:08:55,880
Their kids, are a bit hoity-toity.

117
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,360
By the way, did you keep the
bank documents in the drawer?

118
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:06,800
This is the third time I said yes.

119
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,368
Documents!
That's all you think about.

120
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:16,215
Have we gone our for an
outing like this before?

121
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:20,140
Haven't we? Every year, we go
to Dakshineshwar temple, the zoo.

122
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:22,022
Damn.

123
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,793
That is different.
A whole gang packed like sardines.

124
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:30,910
Like now, just the two of us.
We haven't done that.

125
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,715
I know that you don't enjoy

126
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:40,088
my company on such trips.

127
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:43,503
I can feel it.

128
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:47,990
How about some tea? Should we stop?

129
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,628
Driver, stop when you see
a tea stall.

130
00:10:22,643 --> 00:10:25,075
Tublu, don't stand so
close to the door.

131
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:53,318
Where are you?
It's going to rain any minute.

132
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:56,248
Why don't you give them a call
to see if they have left?

133
00:10:57,275 --> 00:11:00,085
It always rains on this day.
After all, it's Ulta Rath.

134
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,313
What is this?
- Take a look.

135
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,845
These sepia...

136
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:20,835
These sepia toned photos.

137
00:11:21,495 --> 00:11:22,543
Great.

138
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,635
Is that all you saw?
The sepia tone?

139
00:11:32,153 --> 00:11:33,893
Jona! Pass me a cigarette.

140
00:11:35,158 --> 00:11:36,543
You still owe me three.

141
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,197
You have repaid me yet.

142
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,068
I am just requesting for one more.

143
00:11:42,457 --> 00:11:43,495
My father-in-law has come.

144
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:44,888
What?

145
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:48,922
What has that got to do...
- Hurry up, guys.

146
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:52,358
Phatik, who all are coming?
- Why do you care?

147
00:11:52,705 --> 00:11:54,500
Listen. Quickly cut the onions.
Get the fish ready.

148
00:11:54,987 --> 00:11:56,900
The mutton is yet to be washed?

149
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,527
Jona, wash the mutton.

150
00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:03,905
If the cook finds out you guys are
lagging behind, he will lose it.

151
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,688
Remember this sari?
- Which one?

152
00:12:10,782 --> 00:12:12,218
Just take a look.

153
00:12:13,992 --> 00:12:16,998
You gifted me this at Mamoni's
wedding. It's it beautiful?

154
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:21,160
Hey, come here and see why
the string has gotten entangled.

155
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:24,153
What's up? Well,
that which happens all too often.

156
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:27,073
Let me see.
Now how did this happen?

157
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,213
Well, I tried to pull on this side
and the other side slid right in.

158
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:36,208
I can't imagine how one makes
the same error for fifty years!

159
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:37,613
Hang on.

160
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,250
I think I can fix this using
my fingers.

161
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:44,457
But if not,
I will need a safety pin.

162
00:12:44,673 --> 00:12:46,868
Sister-in-law.
- Yeah. Come in.

163
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,018
Hang on a second.

164
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,970
All nicely decorated.
- Okay.

165
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:58,553
The day you first stepped into this
house, I was just a little boy.

166
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,585
I do remember it all though.

167
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:02,800
What's all this?

168
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,200
Well, Roshni is stepping into this
house for the first time today.

169
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:10,282
We plan to welcome her formally.

170
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:14,045
But back in those days,
there used to be a gold coin.

171
00:13:14,262 --> 00:13:16,510
Thank heavens! I have managed
to untangle the stupid knot.

172
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:20,260
Please don't mess this up
anymore. Okay?

173
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,208
I have no idea how
this keeps happening.

174
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,018
Yes, Tonu. You have
reached already.

175
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:28,175
Almost there? Okay.
Has aunty reached?

176
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,078
Superb.

177
00:13:30,748 --> 00:13:32,208
See you shortly. Okay.

178
00:13:33,473 --> 00:13:34,555
Sister,

179
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,392
another surprise for dad and mom.

180
00:13:38,438 --> 00:13:39,723
Look.

181
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,675
Still have goosebumps
just looking at this.

182
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,740
It's amazing.

183
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,313
Remarkable.

184
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:55,757
They are here.

185
00:13:57,022 --> 00:13:58,210
They are here!

186
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:16,233
Hey, you all. Come out to help.
Very well. - How are you, Phatik?

187
00:14:16,558 --> 00:14:19,530
You are have...
- Hey, Roshni. This is Phatik.

188
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,807
Oh yes, of course.

189
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,522
Come! Welcome.

190
00:14:23,642 --> 00:14:26,613
Mom. How are you?

191
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,640
Fine. There she is.
- Stay well, my dear.

192
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,738
Come.
- Bless you.

193
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:34,278
Do you know who I am?

194
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:36,213
Stumped?

195
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:39,230
How's she suppose to? She
is seeing her for the first time.

196
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,755
I am his elder uncle's wife.
- Your turn.

197
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:45,047
Oh my. Not me.
- Why not?

198
00:14:45,403 --> 00:14:46,798
You could have told me.

199
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:49,230
Talk to him.
- It's yours, dear.

200
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,673
You do it. Let me play
the conch shell instead.

201
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:54,700
Oh dear, you are so old-fashioned.

202
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:57,997
Let's begin.

203
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,798
You would have
done a much better job than me.

204
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,463
Exactly. That should be done.

205
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:18,742
What a welcome!

206
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:21,130
With this much fanfare,
you should have worn a sari.

207
00:15:22,785 --> 00:15:25,542
In that case, you should have worn
your traditional Bengali outfit.

208
00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:28,622
Mom, you are defending her?
- Of course.

209
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,995
That's right.

210
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:33,805
You know when she came to our
family as a newly wed,

211
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:37,887
she was everyone's go-to person.
See?

212
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:40,528
Come inside.
- Wait.

213
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,225
I don't get a welcome now that the
new bride is here? You came alone?

214
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:49,360
Why?

215
00:15:50,777 --> 00:15:51,825
I am not enough?

216
00:15:52,377 --> 00:15:53,598
Come on in.

217
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:06,908
Hold on a sec.
- Why? What's up?

218
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,092
Looks okay?

219
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:18,983
Come.

220
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,578
The bag?

221
00:16:34,215 --> 00:16:35,783
Please bring the bag in.
- Okay.

222
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,152
Hello, Santosh.

223
00:17:28,718 --> 00:17:30,378
Thank you, my dear.

224
00:17:31,102 --> 00:17:32,875
That you have brought these
red roses for me.

225
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:36,560
You thought about me.

226
00:17:36,777 --> 00:17:39,707
I am feeling very, very special.

227
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:41,815
It's not just for you,
brother-in-law.

228
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:44,333
It's for the two of you.

229
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:46,712
The wedding involved you both,
didn't it? - Really?

230
00:17:47,545 --> 00:17:52,680
That may be. But, for now,
these roses are mine.

231
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:57,890
Just because I am old, everyone
gives me white flowers. - So sad.

232
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:00,073
Your mother couldn't come?

233
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,570
Her knee is aching up.

234
00:18:03,403 --> 00:18:05,825
And this is a long drive.
I didn't want to take any chances.

235
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:07,437
Well, what about your son then?

236
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:10,475
Well, he doesn't budge unless
his grandma does.

237
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,155
Hey you.

238
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:15,143
You have been told not to put
all of it in one go.

239
00:18:15,835 --> 00:18:17,208
Jona can fry really well.

240
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:19,220
Jona.

241
00:18:21,998 --> 00:18:23,078
Enough.

242
00:18:23,878 --> 00:18:26,658
What a shoddy job.

243
00:18:29,448 --> 00:18:31,285
You swine.

244
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:33,350
No cussing while cooking.

245
00:18:34,032 --> 00:18:36,280
It spoils the taste.

246
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:42,422
Wow!

247
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:46,367
Stairway to heaven.

248
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:50,778
Mom asked us to sleep in here?

249
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,563
This room is for our new bride.

250
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:09,817
Why us? You and dad could
have stayed here.

251
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:14,900
Are you serious? You think
your dad and me

252
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,593
can climb those stairs at our age?

253
00:19:19,193 --> 00:19:20,772
But still, mom. So fancy.

254
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:23,038
You see.

255
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,162
When I joined this family
as a new bride,

256
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,490
my mother-in-law offered me
this very same room.

257
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,638
I am merely keeping the Basu
family tradition alive.

258
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:37,772
Sister-in-law.
- Coming.

259
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:40,508
You two settle down.
I am needed there.

260
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,215
Who's that old man?

261
00:20:04,032 --> 00:20:05,090
Golok uncle.

262
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,972
The great cook - Golok.
They are our family's cooks.

263
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:11,870
They?

264
00:20:12,518 --> 00:20:16,138
Yeah, their entire family.

265
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:19,015
Golok uncle. His father.
His father's father.

266
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,875
Everyone has to be a cook?

267
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,373
What if someone wants
to do something else?

268
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:28,468
I suppose, they can.

269
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:30,727
But they take it as their pride.

270
00:20:32,393 --> 00:20:34,068
I am repeating myself here.

271
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:37,115
That too a thousand times.

272
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:40,673
I don't know. I don't
feel like going over this again.

273
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:44,078
Mamoni!

274
00:20:44,198 --> 00:20:47,398
I have to hang up now.
Please contact Mr. Panicker.

275
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:50,457
Yes, mom.

276
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:56,533
What's up with you?
- Nothing much.

277
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,695
Where's dad?
- Are you done?

278
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:04,285
The mutton has been marinating for
hours. Ask him to start cooking it.

279
00:21:04,405 --> 00:21:07,237
Don't bring down the house.
All in good time. - Okay.

280
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:09,463
Phatik, what's there?

281
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:11,678
A temple.

282
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,700
Highly awakened goddess in there.

283
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,830
When folks used to live in that old
house, the temple was used a lot.

284
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:19,095
Old house?

285
00:21:20,715 --> 00:21:24,567
There. Don't start exploring. Okay?
It's forbidden to go there.

286
00:21:25,248 --> 00:21:26,490
If the master hears of it...

287
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:29,010
Hey, Pocha. Start frying
the mutton. - Yes.

288
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,765
It takes time to cook.
- I will.

289
00:21:32,143 --> 00:21:33,593
He has to rush me with
every little thing.

290
00:21:33,873 --> 00:21:35,658
Hey there, Pocha.
Finish marinating the mutton.

291
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,760
You scared me.

292
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,393
The hunted.
- Why are you freaking her out?

293
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,237
I am not freaking her. I
am already freaked out,

294
00:21:51,262 --> 00:21:53,203
and on top of that you are
tapping me from behind.

295
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,010
These are old habits.

296
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,545
You know, he had locked me in here
for a day in our childhood. - Who?

297
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,912
Your dear husband.

298
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:03,485
Oh my. You were that cruel?

299
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:04,933
You mean, he has changed now?
- What are you wearing?

300
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,718
So, Tonu? We were kidding
around back then.

301
00:22:09,442 --> 00:22:10,998
You know, back in those days,

302
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,550
he used to bore the hell out of me.
Well, not bore, more like torture.

303
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:19,442
That's not right.
- Very bad boy.

304
00:22:21,095 --> 00:22:22,447
No!

305
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:24,078
Not really.

306
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:26,923
We were young then.

307
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:29,203
Early teens, maybe. Right?

308
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,468
Pompi?
- Coming.

309
00:22:35,203 --> 00:22:38,175
Now make sure you don't lock
your sister up again.

310
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,108
You are looking nice.

311
00:22:45,518 --> 00:22:48,330
Well, I hear Tonu has brought

312
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,113
Surja Modak's sweets.
Where are those?

313
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,703
Really, brother-in-law.

314
00:22:54,092 --> 00:22:58,537
You tell me I am still
going strong and you?

315
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:01,005
Not to be left behind.
You are aware

316
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,802
of everything amidst all
chaos. - No, it's not that.

317
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,518
My grandfather would routinely get
sweets from Surja Modak. - Okay.

318
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:11,362
My father didn't go that far,
of course.

319
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:14,065
But he would still
on special occasions...

320
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,690
Here you go. Surja Modak.
- Here.

321
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,662
Phatik, all well?

322
00:23:18,782 --> 00:23:20,208
Just wow.
- Take one.

323
00:23:20,328 --> 00:23:25,138
We get this everyday. You don't.
Take more. We got this for you two.

324
00:23:25,258 --> 00:23:29,377
It's okay. Here. Well,
one thing is clear. Jolbhora

325
00:23:29,603 --> 00:23:32,943
still has juice in it.

326
00:23:34,252 --> 00:23:36,847
Phatik, have you seen Roshni?
- No.

327
00:23:37,085 --> 00:23:39,052
Sister! Here's your tea.

328
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:43,657
Then go get some rest. It'll
be a while before things start.

329
00:23:43,777 --> 00:23:47,050
It's 5:30 now. Program starts
at 7:30. - Program?

330
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,087
What program?
- Did you hear that?

331
00:23:50,112 --> 00:23:53,245
Now please don't interfere.
- Okay.

332
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,613
How can it be that we would have
no say? Why are you saying that?

333
00:23:57,872 --> 00:24:00,563
Why are you saying that?

334
00:24:00,683 --> 00:24:03,732
How many are as blessed as you are!
- Exactly.

335
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:05,763
I am here after such a long while.

336
00:24:06,392 --> 00:24:09,623
This house stands still
because of this man.

337
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,268
I don't see Tublu around?

338
00:24:14,068 --> 00:24:15,690
Where has he gone?

339
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:28,305
You are here?

340
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:30,598
Everyone is looking for you.

341
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,663
Why all of a sudden?

342
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:35,788
Tell them I am busy.

343
00:24:36,598 --> 00:24:37,808
That doesn't sound nice.

344
00:24:39,873 --> 00:24:43,063
I can't be like Tonu,
the puny, obedient cat.

345
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:47,463
Why do you say that? There
are many there you can talk to.

346
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:52,037
Please go, mom. Why don't you go
and talk about the good old day?

347
00:24:53,303 --> 00:24:54,612
I am cursed.

348
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:56,947
May I come in?

349
00:24:57,845 --> 00:24:59,865
Brother, tea for you.

350
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,747
Hey.

351
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:05,173
You didn't have to... - Well,
you weren't coming to get it.

352
00:25:06,135 --> 00:25:08,092
I was saying...

353
00:25:08,212 --> 00:25:12,200
Roshni was wanting to see
the old part of the house.

354
00:25:12,718 --> 00:25:15,908
I said to make sure that was okay.

355
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,343
"I have with me all I have for you"

356
00:25:26,843 --> 00:25:31,200
"to offer everything to you."
- Parimal.

357
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,287
Congratulations, my friend.
- What an entry.

358
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,708
How are you all? Tonu.
- Good!

359
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:43,718
Well, what goodies do you have
in the bag of yours?

360
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,597
Well, let me figure
out who gets the goodies,

361
00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:49,125
then I will reveal the what part.

362
00:25:49,222 --> 00:25:52,313
How are you?
- Same.

363
00:25:52,713 --> 00:25:56,095
Because of these two, I get to meet
up with people from the past.

364
00:25:56,215 --> 00:25:57,762
How are you?
- Very fine.

365
00:25:57,882 --> 00:26:01,275
Wow. Look at this spread.
- Have a seat.

366
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,225
Phatik. A round of freshly
made tea please.

367
00:26:30,605 --> 00:26:32,162
You...
- Poka.

368
00:26:35,285 --> 00:26:37,545
What is that?
- You don't know?

369
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:39,995
She has kept the Po in Porimal Kaka

370
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,190
and also the Ka in the
end. Hence, Po Ka.

371
00:26:45,165 --> 00:26:48,073
Weren't you expected this morning?
- Let me take it.

372
00:26:48,452 --> 00:26:52,020
You know my unreliability
is my strong point. - That I know.

373
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,855
I had some work in the morning.

374
00:26:53,975 --> 00:26:58,170
By work you mean trying
to land a girl?

375
00:27:00,008 --> 00:27:01,607
How do you know
I don't have a girlfriend?

376
00:27:01,727 --> 00:27:05,457
Exactly. How do you know that?
- So you are still going strong.

377
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,922
Look who's talking.
A half century of romance.

378
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,305
Great achievement. Manjari.

379
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:16,635
Tenacity, Parimal. Tenacity.
- So all the credit

380
00:27:17,122 --> 00:27:19,025
goes to her?
- No.

381
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,982
80% for her. 20% for you.
- What do you mean?

382
00:27:23,102 --> 00:27:27,738
Tolerating you for fifty years.
What a scary thought.

383
00:27:28,635 --> 00:27:30,268
One and half teaspoons sugar for
you, right?

384
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,728
I was wrong about the 80%.
Make it 100%.

385
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,305
She still remembers how much
sugar I take.

386
00:27:37,425 --> 00:27:40,268
That's amazing.
- Right, Poka.

387
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,160
Roshni?

388
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,613
Have you seen Roshni?

389
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:38,563
I am calling her but can't reach
her. - Oh my God.

390
00:28:38,975 --> 00:28:43,268
Where is she? In this house...
- Where were you?

391
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,250
I was with brother.

392
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,262
Look at that concern.

393
00:28:48,382 --> 00:28:52,305
Stop it now. Hey, look where she
is. We must look for her. - Hey.

394
00:28:52,425 --> 00:28:54,338
Call Phatik.

395
00:28:54,705 --> 00:28:56,078
Phatik?

396
00:28:57,343 --> 00:28:59,495
Hey, listen. Have you seen Roshni?

397
00:29:00,315 --> 00:29:04,120
The new bride. That way?
- She went that way.

398
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:27,783
I was back there.

399
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:31,957
She said how beautiful the pond
was and then she asked about...

400
00:29:33,157 --> 00:29:34,757
Stop talking rubbish.

401
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,148
They are saying

402
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:40,873
they saw her go towards
the back of the house. - What?

403
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:45,135
Hang on. Back there means...

404
00:29:45,513 --> 00:29:46,962
Towards the old mansion.

405
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,568
Roshni!

406
00:30:07,113 --> 00:30:08,217
Roshni!

407
00:30:10,412 --> 00:30:11,547
Roshni!

408
00:30:33,525 --> 00:30:36,338
I have repeatedly told you
to keep an eye so that

409
00:30:36,363 --> 00:30:39,850
no one goes towards the old
mansion. Haven't I? - Roshni?

410
00:30:39,947 --> 00:30:42,022
You too should have kept
an eye on her.

411
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:45,417
It should have been made clear
to her from the start.

412
00:30:53,147 --> 00:30:55,748
I have gone hoarse reminding
everyone not to go there.

413
00:30:55,773 --> 00:30:56,878
Does anyone care to listen.

414
00:30:56,975 --> 00:30:59,605
Roshni.
- In the end, no one listens to

415
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,213
an old man until they have to.

416
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,877
Now we can't find her.

417
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:06,953
Alright. Stop it now.

418
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:10,650
Relax. No need to get all
worked up. She is not a kid...

419
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:17,883
Must be Roshni.
- Where are you?

420
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:22,358
Wait there. I am coming.

421
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,168
She's near the Khidki pond.

422
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,672
You all go back. I am bringing
her along.

423
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:32,433
Khidki pond?

424
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:34,975
Strange.

425
00:32:22,015 --> 00:32:23,075
Roshni!

426
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:31,098
Roshni!

427
00:32:32,275 --> 00:32:33,292
Roshni!

428
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,812
What's wrong with you?

429
00:32:43,187 --> 00:32:44,247
What happened?

430
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,452
Who's that man?

431
00:32:52,698 --> 00:32:55,650
Give me some ideas, man.
I am stuck. - What do you need?

432
00:32:55,953 --> 00:32:59,705
I was thinking mom and dad
would sit here. - Sounds good.

433
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:03,975
Then, Aunt can sit here.

434
00:33:04,473 --> 00:33:06,062
Should I light those?

435
00:33:06,505 --> 00:33:08,343
Yes, sure. Go ahead.

436
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,575
And please remove this. - This one,
right? Yeah, it's too big.

437
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:14,785
Hey, you. Come here.

438
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,055
Hurry up, guys.

439
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:20,730
What else?
- And...

440
00:33:21,768 --> 00:33:22,848
Hold on, let me tell these folks.

441
00:33:23,153 --> 00:33:26,265
Well, take this from here.
And turn on those lights.

442
00:33:26,828 --> 00:33:28,125
Keep it outside.

443
00:33:28,245 --> 00:33:30,320
All the way out. Keep it there.

444
00:33:32,438 --> 00:33:35,508
I am thinking. Let's move this
piece and bring that here.

445
00:33:36,103 --> 00:33:39,250
It creates a nice intimate circle.

446
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,448
We can sit here. - That sounds
good. We can gather here

447
00:33:41,473 --> 00:33:43,912
and have the dinner
there. - Yes, absolutely.

448
00:33:44,008 --> 00:33:45,715
Does this still work?

449
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,288
Lovely. Beautiful. - God knows.
It has got a retro feel in it.

450
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:54,937
And the award goes to Phatik.

451
00:33:55,705 --> 00:33:56,775
Yes, I am telling you.

452
00:33:57,532 --> 00:33:59,855
I haven't done anything.
- Who said that?

453
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:02,438
Here, the flowers and the sweets.

454
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:04,257
Do as you please.
- You have kept

455
00:34:04,282 --> 00:34:06,203
Komolini so well.
- You will be awarded.

456
00:34:06,418 --> 00:34:09,380
Not only Komolini... Listen,
come here. Wait! - What is this?

457
00:34:10,038 --> 00:34:11,120
Did you bring the stuff?

458
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,438
What's he telling you?
- Don't interfere.

459
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:17,153
You just said you will award me.

460
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,140
I will tell you what my award will
be? - Yes.

461
00:34:19,498 --> 00:34:22,818
A huge portrait with brother
and sister-in-law.

462
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:24,558
If it's that huge, it won't fit in
through the doors.

463
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:28,288
Let me go and hurry them along.

464
00:34:28,528 --> 00:34:30,818
Otherwise, the dressing up will
never end. - Yeah.

465
00:34:31,047 --> 00:34:32,743
Good idea. Let me go too.

466
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:36,678
Phatik. I need your help. - You
guys, manage here. I am going.

467
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:39,652
Here, this one.

468
00:34:41,503 --> 00:34:42,583
Oh my.

469
00:34:43,513 --> 00:34:45,513
You'll need a dozen safety pins to
bring this under control, my dear.

470
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:48,940
Pin it all over. It's beautiful.

471
00:34:49,935 --> 00:34:51,858
Hey, isn't this your wedding sari?

472
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,952
What a remarkable memory.

473
00:34:55,072 --> 00:34:56,673
Well, if my husband
was around, he would

474
00:34:56,698 --> 00:34:58,358
quip that this is
limited to saris only.

475
00:34:59,718 --> 00:35:02,148
I heard some gossip
when you chose such

476
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:04,725
light colours. That
much I can recall.

477
00:35:04,822 --> 00:35:06,053
Get your petticoat out.

478
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,218
What's wrong, mom?
You have headache?

479
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:17,775
No,

480
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:20,025
didn't get my nap this afternoon.

481
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,673
Where have you been?
- I was just here.

482
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,538
You should wear this
in the evening.

483
00:35:28,922 --> 00:35:29,938
Oh my!

484
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:32,500
This is my wedding saree.

485
00:35:32,748 --> 00:35:36,100
You had this with you? Yes?
- Yes. Yes, ma'am.

486
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,812
"Stored it all this
while with love and care,"

487
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,963
"cleaned and
buffed for you to wear."

488
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,290
You must be crazy, dear.

489
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:50,307
At this age, am I young bride?
Wearing a resplendent red?

490
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,168
So what, mom?
This notion of wearing

491
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,682
white age is a very
Bengali tradition.

492
00:35:55,873 --> 00:35:58,673
Well, I am Bengali after all.

493
00:35:58,793 --> 00:36:02,165
And you? Did you bring your wedding
saree along? - No, I haven't.

494
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:04,243
Did bring a silk sari though.

495
00:36:04,805 --> 00:36:05,832
What is this?

496
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:08,232
Why is your left hand empty?

497
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,588
Did you take off your
wedding bangle?

498
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:13,950
Mamoni?

499
00:36:19,692 --> 00:36:23,033
Earlier today, you managed to leave
the Basu family wonder struck.

500
00:36:23,345 --> 00:36:25,282
Me? Why?

501
00:36:26,103 --> 00:36:29,583
By wandering off to the
old mansion. Leave it.

502
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,875
Am I not supposed to?
- Oh no, dear.

503
00:36:33,453 --> 00:36:35,983
Why?
- God knows.

504
00:36:37,713 --> 00:36:40,255
Something happened a while back.

505
00:36:41,595 --> 00:36:45,270
They all left that mention
and set up life in this one.

506
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,698
That was many years back.

507
00:36:49,968 --> 00:36:52,150
What had happened?

508
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,508
No need to know.

509
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,395
And you have never asked
your husband?

510
00:36:58,628 --> 00:36:59,762
Listen.

511
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,125
This is the Basu family.
You and me, we are not part of it.

512
00:37:05,188 --> 00:37:07,550
I have heard my
mother-in-law bring it up.

513
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:09,255
She was on the phone with someone.

514
00:37:09,793 --> 00:37:11,243
Sounded like someone had
died there.

515
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:13,805
And not a natural death.

516
00:37:14,938 --> 00:37:16,073
Anyway,

517
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:19,783
we are here to celebrate.
Why bother?

518
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,140
Let's see.

519
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,458
P C Chandra Jewellers.

520
00:37:31,848 --> 00:37:33,998
All that is good.

521
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:38,258
Oh my. You look stunning.

522
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,582
See, even your husband
will not recognise you now.

523
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:35,088
Happy anniversary. Here.
- Happy anniversary.

524
00:38:37,013 --> 00:38:39,650
The bigger one.
- No!

525
00:38:42,702 --> 00:38:45,850
What are you doing?
- No, not such a big bite.

526
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,833
Dad, have it.
- Let's click a picture.

527
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,030
Brilliant.

528
00:38:50,055 --> 00:38:52,848
Let me feed you a little.
- No, not me.

529
00:38:52,943 --> 00:38:54,413
Feed dad a little.

530
00:38:54,768 --> 00:38:58,260
He really shouldn't. He is diabetic.
- He is only partially diabetic.

531
00:39:00,045 --> 00:39:02,228
I give up, really.

532
00:39:02,445 --> 00:39:05,472
Open your mouth.
Happy anniversary. - Yay.

533
00:39:05,592 --> 00:39:07,798
Eat to your heart's content.
- Gather around, everyone.

534
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:09,960
A family photo, please.

535
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:12,293
Family photo without you?
That makes no sense. Come here.

536
00:39:12,325 --> 00:39:15,487
Well, then who will click the
photo? How about you, Phatik?

537
00:39:15,512 --> 00:39:19,763
No way. Not me. - What
will happen to huge portrait?

538
00:39:19,883 --> 00:39:22,867
Dad, come. - It's quite easy. The
camera is not going to bite you.

539
00:39:22,987 --> 00:39:27,093
Move the chair.
- No, I can't do it.

540
00:39:27,213 --> 00:39:30,378
My eighty year old mother-in-law
also can. You can do it.

541
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:33,513
Okay. Show me what to do.
- Go, show him. Come here.

542
00:39:33,633 --> 00:39:36,693
Okay, since there is no other go...

543
00:39:36,813 --> 00:39:39,222
Come here. This side.

544
00:39:39,342 --> 00:39:43,405
You two, you look like you were
forced to marry each other.

545
00:39:43,525 --> 00:39:46,703
What is she saying?
- Brother, come here. Aunt.

546
00:39:46,823 --> 00:39:50,390
Hang on, everyone.
- Okay.

547
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,595
Go and stand there.
- Stand here.

548
00:39:52,865 --> 00:39:56,380
Get us in the frame. Move to your
side. - Where are you guys?

549
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:01,948
Okay, ready? One! Two! Three!

550
00:40:07,357 --> 00:40:08,957
Yay.
- Now mine?

551
00:40:09,077 --> 00:40:12,685
Let me see what you clicked.
- The huge portrait.

552
00:40:12,805 --> 00:40:15,835
Here see.
- Come here, Phatik.

553
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:20,420
Are we there in the frame?
- Ready? Everyone is there. Okay?

554
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,748
Wait. - I can't find Phatik
in the frame. Sorry, it's fine.

555
00:40:24,868 --> 00:40:27,235
Ready? One! Two! Three!

556
00:40:31,082 --> 00:40:32,228
Back in the day,

557
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:37,525
the pomp and glory of this house
was simply astounding.

558
00:40:38,153 --> 00:40:41,095
Many renowned singers stopped by.

559
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,305
The nautch girls would
rock the place.

560
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:45,395
They would shoot movies here.
- Really?

561
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:49,947
Movies? - You got that right.
I've seen it all with my own eyes.

562
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,000
The film, Dutta, was shot
in this house.

563
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:57,503
The great star, Suchitra Sen,
used to stay in that room.

564
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:02,638
What a beauty!
What a temper she has.

565
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:07,515
Suchitara Sen?
- No! Suchitra Sen.

566
00:41:07,872 --> 00:41:09,515
Of Uttam Suchitra fame.

567
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,828
Uncle, should I pour some now?
- Pour on.

568
00:41:15,688 --> 00:41:20,065
After fifty years, there are no
secrets, Parimal. - Why not?

569
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:24,198
That means you have some,
don't you? Spill the beans!

570
00:41:24,223 --> 00:41:25,495
Tell us, Poka.

571
00:41:26,488 --> 00:41:27,950
Do you know who
accompanied your father

572
00:41:27,975 --> 00:41:29,690
for the selection
of his bride? - Who?

573
00:41:30,272 --> 00:41:31,258
Remember?

574
00:41:33,548 --> 00:41:37,265
Yours truly. Of course,
I was not alone.

575
00:41:37,785 --> 00:41:40,602
His father came
along and then there

576
00:41:40,993 --> 00:41:43,430
was the potential groom himself.

577
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:46,100
We were sitting around, I looked at

578
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,583
the bride-to-be's face.
She has this bewildered look.

579
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:52,128
She seemed unsure. Who was
she potentially marrying?

580
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:57,373
Your father, he is great man,
handsome, confident.

581
00:41:57,493 --> 00:42:00,562
He thinks any woman will choose
him. - That's right.

582
00:42:01,015 --> 00:42:05,167
That any woman can fancy me
is beyond his imagination.

583
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,985
Hold on. Parimal,

584
00:42:09,105 --> 00:42:12,715
are you into doping or is this is
the plot of your new novel? - Why?

585
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,440
When was it that I fancied you?

586
00:42:15,893 --> 00:42:17,520
Well, as they say, a guilty
conscience needs no accuser.

587
00:42:18,758 --> 00:42:20,415
Did I say that?

588
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:24,358
Did I say that? - Phatik, move
aside. You are blocking my view.

589
00:42:25,363 --> 00:42:27,137
May I say something?

590
00:42:28,543 --> 00:42:32,067
Well, may be not.
- Go on.

591
00:42:32,348 --> 00:42:33,493
Speak freely.

592
00:42:33,883 --> 00:42:38,143
Well, it's really nothing. My
mother-in-law did mention that

593
00:42:38,263 --> 00:42:41,310
the two of you knew each other
before your marriage.

594
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:46,133
Theirs was a sort of love
marriage, really.

595
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:50,693
What is this sort of love marriage?
Please clarify.

596
00:42:50,813 --> 00:42:53,182
Amazing. - I am her son and

597
00:42:53,588 --> 00:42:56,507
yet she tells you this but not me.

598
00:42:57,068 --> 00:42:59,553
No, she's sort of right. I did
- Listen to this.

599
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:01,915
know him a bit during
my college days.

600
00:43:02,528 --> 00:43:04,938
The marriage, itself, was,

601
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,258
well, arranged later.

602
00:43:09,242 --> 00:43:12,280
After fifty years,
surprises remain.

603
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,217
He had just returned from England
trained as a barrister at law.

604
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,670
And I was a fresher
at Presidency College.

605
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,315
English was your major, no?
- Yes.

606
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,250
Don't interrupt please.

607
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:34,940
Go on.
- Okay. Your father,

608
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:38,023
he was the heartthrob
of every woman

609
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:40,262
in the college. Because
he was so handsome. - Great.

610
00:43:40,475 --> 00:43:44,940
Well, he still is.
- Exactly.

611
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:47,848
Tell them, Parimal. You too
used to join us. - Yes.

612
00:43:48,303 --> 00:43:52,833
Me, him, Prabal, Asheem, Phulu.
- Wait.

613
00:43:52,953 --> 00:43:55,623
Would Asheem show up as
well? - Yes, of course.

614
00:43:55,743 --> 00:43:57,215
He was a student at Calcutta
medical college then.

615
00:43:57,253 --> 00:43:58,965
Don't you remember?
- And then?

616
00:43:59,062 --> 00:44:01,645
Those days are right
before my eyes.

617
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:04,110
And we girls would all
show up as well.

618
00:44:04,543 --> 00:44:09,223
Seeing him, my girlfriends
would go all weak in their knees.

619
00:44:09,482 --> 00:44:10,510
And you?

620
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,475
That he was so handsome.
No argument there.

621
00:44:14,595 --> 00:44:17,178
But I was never that star-struck.
- Okay.

622
00:44:17,298 --> 00:44:19,060
Dad, did you feel these things?

623
00:44:20,487 --> 00:44:25,255
What? That mom was trying to... Let
me hear. - You'll get a tight slap.

624
00:44:25,525 --> 00:44:28,945
No, listen. Well, such thoughts
were far from my mind back then.

625
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:31,095
Exactly.
- This is exaggeration.

626
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:35,017
You know, love, romance, and such
minor vices, - It wasn't there.

627
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:37,373
emotions,

628
00:44:37,493 --> 00:44:41,503
no one was in the mindset
for all that. - That's right.

629
00:44:41,947 --> 00:44:45,773
He was a careerist, right?
His idols were Nehru, Churchill.

630
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:49,470
Careerist, for sure. But
not a philistine. He loved poetry.

631
00:44:49,863 --> 00:44:51,030
Exactly which year was this?

632
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:58,025
Say 1966.
- Yes, '66. Yes.

633
00:44:58,145 --> 00:45:02,068
Right. 1966. - We were
dreaming of a brave new world.

634
00:45:02,188 --> 00:45:03,463
Communist.

635
00:45:04,198 --> 00:45:07,485
Dreams of a socialist revolution.
- Dad.

636
00:45:07,885 --> 00:45:13,572
You know, those hours spent at
The Coffee House were so magical.

637
00:45:14,653 --> 00:45:17,398
Different believes. Different ways.

638
00:45:18,718 --> 00:45:22,243
Even the thoughts were different

639
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:25,313
and that inevitably led
to heated arguments.

640
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:29,335
No fighting though.

641
00:45:29,562 --> 00:45:32,697
And yet, a day or two later,

642
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:37,820
each of us paid up our college dues
and became friends all over again.

643
00:45:51,452 --> 00:45:53,452
You hijacked the conversation.

644
00:45:53,572 --> 00:45:56,013
What did I do? - Mom was about
to say something. Mom, go ahead.

645
00:45:56,543 --> 00:45:57,970
What is this?
- Don't talk.

646
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:00,050
About your father?

647
00:46:00,075 --> 00:46:01,202
Here. Welcome.
- Thank you.

648
00:46:01,238 --> 00:46:04,793
Thank you. - Well, I noticed him
at The Coffee House mainly.

649
00:46:05,593 --> 00:46:07,235
We had never been
formally introduced.

650
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,817
He was a bit senior, frankly.

651
00:46:09,237 --> 00:46:12,155
Then, one fine day, a match
came from his family.

652
00:46:12,415 --> 00:46:16,815
My uncle's son was his father's
client. - Did they ask you first?

653
00:46:17,868 --> 00:46:20,148
In those days, no one bothered.
Not back then.

654
00:46:20,938 --> 00:46:22,592
Almost blind.

655
00:46:22,852 --> 00:46:27,025
Well, my uncle mentioned
that the would be groom

656
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,787
was planning a visit soon.

657
00:46:29,628 --> 00:46:32,602
I knew they were looking for
someone worthy.

658
00:46:33,055 --> 00:46:37,727
But I didn't know it would be him.
One thing is true, though.

659
00:46:38,385 --> 00:46:41,888
Had I objected, no one would
force me into a marriage.

660
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:44,732
In that sense, they were
very progressive.

661
00:46:45,207 --> 00:46:48,515
We have now heard your side of the
story, mom. Now, dad, your side.

662
00:46:49,013 --> 00:46:51,337
My side of the story? One day,

663
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,223
out of the blue, my father said,
listen up,

664
00:46:54,547 --> 00:46:58,528
coming Sunday you are going to
see this girl. He is acting well.

665
00:46:58,648 --> 00:47:03,230
Just like legendary Chhabi Biswas.

666
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:05,020
His dad. He was a sample.

667
00:47:05,475 --> 00:47:09,313
We called him Hitler.
- Don't listen to this.

668
00:47:09,433 --> 00:47:11,802
He always treated me
with affection.

669
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:17,228
Mom? What was your thought
when you first saw dad?

670
00:47:17,563 --> 00:47:19,983
Finally, an important question.
Correct.

671
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:22,675
You couldn't come up with
a better question. - Really.

672
00:47:22,795 --> 00:47:27,395
To be honest, I was a little
afraid. No! - What?

673
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:31,752
Not after seeing him.

674
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:36,183
You see, in those days,
there was no looking back.

675
00:47:36,303 --> 00:47:40,248
I mean, once you committed,
that was for life. - Fair.

676
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,713
Now, may I say something?
- Please.

677
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,967
Do you know how I felt when

678
00:47:47,913 --> 00:47:50,723
I first saw her?

679
00:47:51,642 --> 00:47:54,075
I don't know how to put it...

680
00:47:55,868 --> 00:47:58,883
A feeling of contentment. Delight.

681
00:47:59,003 --> 00:48:02,063
But what was that exactly...

682
00:48:02,183 --> 00:48:06,040
He had no clue what that
meant. - Love at first sight, dad?

683
00:48:09,013 --> 00:48:10,193
Pure bliss.

684
00:48:23,047 --> 00:48:25,047
Elder sister-in-law wants you
downstairs.

685
00:48:28,463 --> 00:48:29,673
Phatik,

686
00:48:32,355 --> 00:48:33,803
does Prahlad uncle live

687
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:36,972
there all alone?

688
00:48:44,528 --> 00:48:46,420
We are not allowed to go there.

689
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:49,543
And...

690
00:48:50,777 --> 00:48:53,988
Ranga Babu sends some money
through me each month.

691
00:48:56,962 --> 00:48:58,237
How much money exactly?

692
00:49:01,685 --> 00:49:02,713
500!

693
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:08,637
Just 500.

694
00:49:10,118 --> 00:49:12,625
So everyone can sleep
well at night.

695
00:49:15,598 --> 00:49:16,647
Tell me something.

696
00:49:19,922 --> 00:49:20,970
Never mind.

697
00:49:23,848 --> 00:49:26,702
Well, Phatik.

698
00:49:28,248 --> 00:49:29,565
Have you ever wondered

699
00:49:30,853 --> 00:49:33,198
how a man can live on like

700
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,290
this after such an incident?

701
00:49:40,582 --> 00:49:41,890
You know everything
there is to know.

702
00:49:44,193 --> 00:49:45,447
I am an ordinary servant.

703
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:50,528
See you.

704
00:49:53,815 --> 00:50:01,155
"I longed to forget you"

705
00:50:01,385 --> 00:50:05,037
"but could not."

706
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:10,098
"I longed to forget you"

707
00:50:10,337 --> 00:50:17,050
"but could not."

708
00:50:17,947 --> 00:50:21,137
"Your memories,

709
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,418
"like shadows,"

710
00:50:25,538 --> 00:50:32,012
"left me not."

711
00:50:32,132 --> 00:50:37,200
"I longed to forget you"

712
00:50:37,548 --> 00:50:43,860
"but could not."

713
00:50:46,402 --> 00:50:49,568
"You could never grasp"

714
00:50:50,185 --> 00:50:55,818
"how it burns to be apart."

715
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,898
"Dream garlands, once of flowers,"

716
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:08,012
"wilted, now of thorns."

717
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:14,962
"The pain of losing you is"

718
00:51:15,395 --> 00:51:22,055
"a shroud on my being."

719
00:51:22,445 --> 00:51:27,483
"I longed to forget you"

720
00:51:27,805 --> 00:51:33,993
"but could not."

721
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:39,103
"I longed to forget you"

722
00:51:39,223 --> 00:51:46,087
"but could not."
- Take the camera closer to her.

723
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:49,740
Simply wow.
A Pratima Bandopadhyay special.

724
00:51:50,713 --> 00:51:51,957
Wonderful!

725
00:51:52,778 --> 00:51:55,082
You continue to sing so well.

726
00:51:55,202 --> 00:51:59,310
I bet she practices secretly.
- No. Oh come on.

727
00:51:59,968 --> 00:52:02,207
Of course, there was a time
when I did train regularly.

728
00:52:03,615 --> 00:52:05,562
Once Tublu's father passed away...

729
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,658
You are simply brilliant.

730
00:52:07,928 --> 00:52:09,270
Too bad we won't hear Tublu sing.

731
00:52:10,178 --> 00:52:11,918
That boy loves music.

732
00:52:15,918 --> 00:52:18,005
On whose orders
are the front gates open?

733
00:52:20,622 --> 00:52:22,405
Biju, Narayan,

734
00:52:23,065 --> 00:52:25,238
ask Kameshwar to bring 20 soldiers.

735
00:52:27,173 --> 00:52:30,815
Who has turned on the chandeliers
without my permission? Who?

736
00:52:32,188 --> 00:52:34,243
Our man has gone crazy again.

737
00:52:34,697 --> 00:52:36,113
Make sure he doesn't get an entry.

738
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:39,108
This morning, I ran into him.

739
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:40,665
He was cussing like crazy.

740
00:52:40,903 --> 00:52:43,768
Remember that broad who
went in there...

741
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:48,038
But she was such a doll. Shut up.

742
00:52:48,383 --> 00:52:49,757
Show some respect
for the new bride!

743
00:52:57,565 --> 00:53:02,895
He didn't even bother to ask.

744
00:53:03,177 --> 00:53:05,383
I don't get it.

745
00:53:57,272 --> 00:53:58,450
Prahlad uncle.

746
00:54:02,883 --> 00:54:04,192
Can you recognise me?

747
00:54:12,973 --> 00:54:15,903
We meet after a long time.

748
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:19,237
I saw Tublu after a long time.

749
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:22,328
I do understand. I am coming
back on Wednesday. Yeah.

750
00:54:23,863 --> 00:54:26,900
But tell them that I will be
there by...

751
00:54:28,468 --> 00:54:29,518
So send a mail.

752
00:54:31,345 --> 00:54:32,815
Yeah, send them on Monday.

753
00:54:33,313 --> 00:54:36,373
And tell them I will be back.
Wednesday. Bye.

754
00:54:38,092 --> 00:54:40,568
I will land on Tuesday night. Yeah.

755
00:54:43,043 --> 00:54:44,535
Okay. Yeah.

756
00:54:45,335 --> 00:54:47,347
I will talk to you tomorrow. Bye.

757
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:04,027
Pass me a cigarette.

758
00:55:08,363 --> 00:55:09,940
Give me a drag.

759
00:55:10,395 --> 00:55:13,975
You remember what a drag is.

760
00:55:14,872 --> 00:55:16,925
Yes, I remember it all.

761
00:55:18,828 --> 00:55:22,330
Come on now. A drag.
- This one? This contains...

762
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:26,947
What? Laced with pot?

763
00:55:27,628 --> 00:55:30,492
Good. Even better.

764
00:55:33,055 --> 00:55:34,190
Pass it.

765
00:55:41,725 --> 00:55:44,752
Where did you get this?
- Phatik.

766
00:55:45,328 --> 00:55:47,122
I had asked him to procure some
from before.

767
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:50,517
Bravo!

768
00:55:52,257 --> 00:55:54,073
What is Tublu up to these days?

769
00:55:55,403 --> 00:55:58,128
The same job as before.

770
00:55:59,078 --> 00:56:03,045
Is this the one with a low salary?

771
00:56:04,593 --> 00:56:06,128
How I struggle to make
both ends meet,

772
00:56:06,917 --> 00:56:10,408
I know and so does the Almighty.

773
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:17,218
Didn't he land a job with
the law firm in Kolkata?

774
00:56:18,127 --> 00:56:19,597
He didn't take it up?

775
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,068
I can only share this with you.

776
00:56:23,695 --> 00:56:25,598
He has his father's stubbornness.

777
00:56:26,538 --> 00:56:29,857
Refused to take that up because
your husband had recommended him.

778
00:56:31,435 --> 00:56:35,263
He didn't bring it up with me.
But you know, I am his mother.

779
00:56:36,355 --> 00:56:37,372
I get it.

780
00:56:39,058 --> 00:56:43,005
You misunderstand him
and that hurts you.

781
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:48,172
Fact is, he needs you
everywhere he goes.

782
00:56:49,718 --> 00:56:52,863
Is he keeping up with
the singing or has he left it?

783
00:56:53,545 --> 00:56:54,582
His whim.

784
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:57,233
Once he gets going,
won't stop all day.

785
00:56:57,258 --> 00:56:58,423
Even forget to shower and eat then.

786
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,360
If someone were to ask him to sing,
that's it.

787
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:05,708
Say at a community function.
A firm no.

788
00:57:06,313 --> 00:57:07,632
Well, he did show up today.

789
00:57:08,713 --> 00:57:10,605
Cares deeply for his cousins.

790
00:57:11,318 --> 00:57:12,788
Doesn't show it though.

791
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:15,533
You know,

792
00:57:18,615 --> 00:57:20,270
it's been a while. I have been
playing this game.

793
00:57:21,783 --> 00:57:23,933
Game?

794
00:57:29,503 --> 00:57:33,070
Sometimes, I shut off everything.

795
00:57:35,557 --> 00:57:37,373
I shut out my life.

796
00:57:38,465 --> 00:57:41,762
I mean, my work, Bombay, family.

797
00:57:43,362 --> 00:57:44,475
Forgetting everything,

798
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:49,880
I think of my childhood.

799
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:55,900
Me too.

800
00:57:59,522 --> 00:58:01,403
Is that so?

801
00:58:04,885 --> 00:58:06,473
It brings solace, doesn't it?

802
00:58:10,345 --> 00:58:11,415
Exactly.

803
00:58:14,745 --> 00:58:17,535
Just like meditation.

804
00:58:19,793 --> 00:58:22,323
A cathartic feeling.

805
00:58:24,822 --> 00:58:27,330
Like when we would all descend
here for the summer holidays.

806
00:58:28,928 --> 00:58:30,702
Palpable excitement all around.

807
00:58:32,237 --> 00:58:34,507
Packing everything
the night before.

808
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:37,945
All my dolls.

809
00:58:38,735 --> 00:58:40,258
Mom would be on my case for that.

810
00:58:41,263 --> 00:58:43,977
She'd say, do you really need to
bring a suitcase full of dolls?

811
00:58:44,595 --> 00:58:46,153
Remember?

812
00:58:46,585 --> 00:58:48,867
How can I forget? Of course.

813
00:58:51,115 --> 00:58:52,563
My cricket gear.

814
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,385
And the ball.

815
00:58:57,038 --> 00:58:58,325
Those cricket matches
in the afternoon.

816
00:58:59,265 --> 00:59:01,007
Dad, grandpa.

817
00:59:02,217 --> 00:59:04,228
Phatik and his antics on the field.

818
00:59:04,952 --> 00:59:08,293
Spreading both his hands.
- Yes, right.

819
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:12,508
Oh my God.

820
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:14,790
Exactly.

821
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,293
Oh my God.

822
00:59:26,595 --> 00:59:28,065
You guys...

823
00:59:28,303 --> 00:59:29,978
A brother sister meeting
in progress?

824
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:35,460
Mom, I am feeling really good.
Come sit, mom.

825
00:59:38,185 --> 00:59:41,103
Some wine?
- That sounds great.

826
00:59:41,223 --> 00:59:44,683
Was missing it. Not
in front of everyone. - Have it.

827
00:59:47,925 --> 00:59:51,872
You know, we were reminiscing.
- Is that so?

828
00:59:54,205 --> 00:59:58,443
Look at me. You live in Mumbai
and he lives in America.

829
00:59:59,298 --> 01:00:04,163
All I have are those memories.
She was born.

830
01:00:04,837 --> 01:00:06,058
Then you.

831
01:00:07,323 --> 01:00:09,495
School admissions,

832
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:12,843
high school exams, university.

833
01:00:13,388 --> 01:00:14,848
Then came the weddings.

834
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:17,627
And soon I became a grandmother.

835
01:00:18,945 --> 01:00:20,978
How time flew.

836
01:00:21,682 --> 01:00:25,617
Why the rush to become grown-ups.
Who asked you to?

837
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:34,352
Mom.

838
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,713
May I say something?
- Go on, dear.

839
01:00:45,768 --> 01:00:47,973
Never mind.
- Why never mind?

840
01:00:50,373 --> 01:00:51,422
Is it about Souren?

841
01:01:00,158 --> 01:01:01,715
What are you doing here all alone?

842
01:01:05,823 --> 01:01:06,850
Listen,

843
01:01:10,558 --> 01:01:11,877
there is something

844
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:17,433
about this room.

845
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:20,880
Believe me.

846
01:01:22,892 --> 01:01:23,918
I mean...

847
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:26,188
I think 10 days back.

848
01:01:28,222 --> 01:01:29,498
10 days back,

849
01:01:30,698 --> 01:01:32,385
I saw this room in my dream.

850
01:01:34,568 --> 01:01:36,255
How many glasses of wine
before that?

851
01:01:41,628 --> 01:01:44,710
You don't believe me, right?
- Okay. Fine. I believe you. Go on.

852
01:01:52,592 --> 01:01:54,862
I don't remember exactly
what I saw.

853
01:01:58,905 --> 01:01:59,998
But...

854
01:02:04,473 --> 01:02:05,598
Trust me.

855
01:02:07,393 --> 01:02:08,700
It was the same room,

856
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:10,885
you know.

857
01:02:11,793 --> 01:02:12,842
Let me tell you

858
01:02:13,523 --> 01:02:14,680
what exactly you saw.

859
01:02:16,053 --> 01:02:19,242
You saw me locking you up
in this room

860
01:02:19,468 --> 01:02:20,755
and I will tell you why.

861
01:02:22,442 --> 01:02:24,367
You knew we were all coming here.

862
01:02:25,468 --> 01:02:26,765
We'd all be together.

863
01:02:27,988 --> 01:02:29,253
That's why you saw this room.

864
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,793
Actually, this room is a symbol
of our shared childhood.

865
01:02:41,295 --> 01:02:42,788
Absolutely, Mr Freud.

866
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:51,210
But I didn't tell your wife why you

867
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:55,145
locked me up in this room.

868
01:02:57,167 --> 01:02:58,432
She would be shocked.

869
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:11,578
Tublu?

870
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:28,013
Where were you?

871
01:03:29,245 --> 01:03:30,587
I was with Prahlad uncle.

872
01:03:36,963 --> 01:03:38,585
Was chatting with your mother.

873
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:40,748
Listen, Tublu.

874
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:43,367
It's time for you to settle
in to a nice job in Kolkata.

875
01:03:43,392 --> 01:03:44,707
You remember

876
01:03:46,662 --> 01:03:48,337
we would walk down that path?

877
01:03:50,802 --> 01:03:52,380
You, me and

878
01:03:53,925 --> 01:03:55,213
Sajal.

879
01:03:57,430 --> 01:04:00,078
We'd sit there

880
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:04,640
and Sajal would teach me how
to play a folk instrument.

881
01:04:09,105 --> 01:04:10,208
Recall any of this,

882
01:04:11,863 --> 01:04:12,900
aunty?

883
01:04:16,597 --> 01:04:17,722
Tell me something.

884
01:04:19,418 --> 01:04:20,857
When I was young,

885
01:04:21,765 --> 01:04:24,408
I would want to put
on your nail polish, your lipstick.

886
01:04:24,433 --> 01:04:26,448
You wouldn't let me
and that made me mad.

887
01:04:26,543 --> 01:04:29,223
I would lock you up here.
What is so shocking about this?

888
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:38,593
Boys don't want to put on nail
polish, lipstick.

889
01:04:38,618 --> 01:04:39,540
That's not natural.

890
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:43,008
The grown-ups would mind. That's
why I didn't give you those things.

891
01:04:43,233 --> 01:04:44,337
Yes, but...

892
01:04:45,483 --> 01:04:47,450
What is there to get shocked?

893
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:51,800
At what? - A minute ago,
you said, your wife,

894
01:04:51,825 --> 01:04:53,615
if she found out,
would get shocked.

895
01:04:57,395 --> 01:04:58,498
Let it go.

896
01:04:59,915 --> 01:05:01,125
Tell me, how are you?

897
01:05:04,053 --> 01:05:05,623
Good question. How am I?

898
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:11,743
So, I wake up in the morning,
take a shower, eat, etc.

899
01:05:11,863 --> 01:05:14,467
Catch the 8:26 train to Howrah.

900
01:05:15,268 --> 01:05:16,848
A bus to office.

901
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:20,307
If the boss is in a good mood,
then great.

902
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,100
Otherwise, bad day.

903
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:25,603
Then either the 5:20 or 6 pm train,
back to my burrow.

904
01:05:26,512 --> 01:05:29,528
Make nice with the wife.
Son's upcoming exams.

905
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:32,413
Office picnic.

906
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:37,862
Once a year, around the time
of the puja,

907
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,003
rent a car and go nuts
idol-hopping.

908
01:05:40,597 --> 01:05:43,062
A middle class existence
on a conveyor belt.

909
01:05:44,218 --> 01:05:45,718
All this is hard for
you to understand.

910
01:05:45,743 --> 01:05:47,118
Your trajectory is a
bit higher than mine.

911
01:05:55,343 --> 01:05:56,423
Does that make

912
01:05:58,228 --> 01:05:59,310
it any easy?

913
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,332
Hold on.

914
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,883
Let me track down your father.

915
01:06:05,365 --> 01:06:07,548
You see, every man needs

916
01:06:08,553 --> 01:06:12,230
his own private space.
Primal need for privacy.

917
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,473
A word missing from our
middle class dictionary.

918
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,303
What have you been seeking, Tonu?

919
01:06:24,142 --> 01:06:26,790
Remember when we used to visit
this place for the summers?

920
01:06:27,568 --> 01:06:28,985
You would go on and on
about your future.

921
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:31,913
Going abroad.

922
01:06:32,432 --> 01:06:33,892
Living in New York.

923
01:06:34,215 --> 01:06:35,458
Couldn't muster enough courage.

924
01:06:38,043 --> 01:06:40,778
You had decided to take
out the mole

925
01:06:40,898 --> 01:06:43,312
by operation. What happened then?

926
01:06:44,382 --> 01:06:46,013
I didn't have the guts not even to

927
01:06:46,038 --> 01:06:47,833
get that simple
thing taken care of.

928
01:06:50,348 --> 01:06:52,205
I always wanted to
run away from here.

929
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:53,865
Off to a place where
no one knew of me.

930
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:58,295
No one to force me to play soccer
or study commerce

931
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:01,430
or get married or have kids.

932
01:07:05,992 --> 01:07:08,640
I don't get you, Tonu.
- Why not?

933
01:07:10,002 --> 01:07:11,408
I can only bring these up with you.

934
01:07:12,337 --> 01:07:13,537
You ought to understand.

935
01:07:14,942 --> 01:07:18,467
I have never been turned on by
women. Not back then, not now.

936
01:07:19,862 --> 01:07:22,845
Boys, yes. But I would find it
crude. I would realise

937
01:07:26,283 --> 01:07:27,980
I was different in some way.

938
01:07:37,267 --> 01:07:38,392
I...

939
01:07:42,002 --> 01:07:45,700
I am not sure I follow.
What are you trying to say?

940
01:07:46,478 --> 01:07:48,433
I know you understand.

941
01:07:49,688 --> 01:07:52,173
It's just that you are scared
to even articulate it, right?

942
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:00,088
Then, Rintu?
- Rintu's my son.

943
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:08,035
He is. But for that to happen...

944
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:15,440
Doctors, Ayurveda, astrologers,

945
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,462
chants, shamans.

946
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:22,843
There were times I would
want to commit suicide.

947
01:08:22,868 --> 01:08:23,735
Just didn't have the guts.

948
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:41,683
Pompi.

949
01:09:40,113 --> 01:09:42,125
Nothing will change.

950
01:09:44,157 --> 01:09:46,308
It will stay the same as before.

951
01:09:51,845 --> 01:09:54,038
You must admit that

952
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:57,508
I have neglected my duties as
your husband

953
01:09:57,628 --> 01:10:00,612
or as Rintu's father. Have I?

954
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,217
And I won't in the future.

955
01:10:11,358 --> 01:10:14,353
Will Rintu end up like you?

956
01:10:18,062 --> 01:10:19,132
Like me?

957
01:10:21,185 --> 01:10:23,963
What are you talking about?
- Don't touch me.

958
01:10:27,012 --> 01:10:29,087
You are sick.
You need to see a doctor.

959
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:51,010
Our forefathers,

960
01:10:51,962 --> 01:10:53,885
as the lineage expanded,

961
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,703
set up three different
establishments.

962
01:10:58,967 --> 01:11:00,600
The first one was abolished,

963
01:11:01,627 --> 01:11:04,740
the second inspired

964
01:11:05,465 --> 01:11:08,243
by Mughal times,

965
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:14,220
and the third and the last one

966
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:19,735
was called Flower Gardens mansion.

967
01:11:20,145 --> 01:11:21,528
It was constructed

968
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:24,793
by Rajabahadur Mohanlal Basu.

969
01:11:25,473 --> 01:11:29,355
The construction was overseen

970
01:11:29,798 --> 01:11:33,453
by himself during British times.

971
01:11:33,907 --> 01:11:38,447
Along side, there was
a summer house,

972
01:11:38,793 --> 01:11:41,583
a bungalow named Red Hut

973
01:11:42,145 --> 01:11:44,165
more like a mansion.

974
01:11:46,232 --> 01:11:48,198
Raja Mohanlal Basu.

975
01:11:49,108 --> 01:11:53,195
In 1913, he earned
the title of Rajabahadur

976
01:11:53,918 --> 01:11:56,427
from the British.

977
01:11:58,503 --> 01:11:59,713
This is our blood.

978
01:12:00,773 --> 01:12:04,340
So, a toast to our forefathers.

979
01:12:04,567 --> 01:12:05,400
Enough now.

980
01:12:05,425 --> 01:12:08,568
Spare her the details of the
glorious past of this family.

981
01:12:08,902 --> 01:12:13,128
Instead, please come and sit by me.
Come. Sit here.

982
01:12:13,873 --> 01:12:16,263
Phatik!

983
01:12:17,138 --> 01:12:20,415
How pretty she is, our new bride.

984
01:12:22,512 --> 01:12:25,907
It's been a while. So when do we
see some grand kids?

985
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:29,950
That's it. Here comes the
familiar attack.

986
01:12:30,503 --> 01:12:31,788
Don't delay.

987
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:35,227
As mothers, you too have
some responsibilities, don't you?

988
01:12:37,888 --> 01:12:39,000
I will be right back.

989
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:47,865
Just spare my son out of this.
Okay?

990
01:12:52,395 --> 01:12:55,585
Don't indulge him in this dirt.

991
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,855
Don't compel me to be nasty.

992
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,893
I warned you just, Souren.

993
01:13:03,942 --> 01:13:05,433
Just shut up!

994
01:13:09,898 --> 01:13:11,563
Having a fight?

995
01:13:15,673 --> 01:13:17,467
Mom, will you please come and sit?

996
01:13:31,877 --> 01:13:34,038
The day went so beautifully

997
01:13:35,553 --> 01:13:36,958
after such a long time.

998
01:13:39,975 --> 01:13:41,002
You know, mom,

999
01:13:41,823 --> 01:13:45,273
I could share so many stories with
brother after such a long time.

1000
01:13:48,623 --> 01:13:51,597
Parimal uncle,

1001
01:13:53,608 --> 01:13:57,315
brother, Tonu and all of you.

1002
01:14:00,363 --> 01:14:03,262
I had so much fun today.

1003
01:14:10,247 --> 01:14:13,533
I failed.

1004
01:14:15,065 --> 01:14:16,778
I failed, mom.

1005
01:14:19,817 --> 01:14:21,245
I failed.

1006
01:14:28,615 --> 01:14:30,405
Sometimes, you know what I feel?

1007
01:14:32,528 --> 01:14:35,480
Just give it all up and come

1008
01:14:36,008 --> 01:14:40,408
and live with you and dad
in Kolkata. - Do that.

1009
01:14:40,678 --> 01:14:44,527
Who's stopping, sweetheart?
We are here for all of you.

1010
01:14:44,948 --> 01:14:45,998
You think,

1011
01:14:46,408 --> 01:14:48,650
just because you are all grown up,
working

1012
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:51,175
that you are no longer our sweetie?

1013
01:14:53,612 --> 01:14:55,298
You know, mom?

1014
01:14:58,303 --> 01:15:01,233
I had decided not to attend this.

1015
01:15:03,935 --> 01:15:06,000
The past few days, a nightmare.

1016
01:15:07,265 --> 01:15:10,682
But I had to come.

1017
01:15:11,588 --> 01:15:12,950
This means something to me.

1018
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:17,718
This is special to me.

1019
01:15:18,162 --> 01:15:20,043
You know?
- This place, right?

1020
01:15:21,135 --> 01:15:25,048
This place... I felt it's as if...

1021
01:15:26,128 --> 01:15:28,950
you and dad

1022
01:15:29,685 --> 01:15:31,328
as if you are

1023
01:15:32,638 --> 01:15:35,773
the Paragon of...
- Paragon.

1024
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:38,778
Leave all this.

1025
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,248
Fifty is just a number.

1026
01:15:44,423 --> 01:15:46,865
Come. Let's go

1027
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:50,033
and join others for dinner.
I'll take you, come with me.

1028
01:15:55,082 --> 01:15:57,620
Will you carry me, mom?
- Yeah sure.

1029
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:01,665
Roshni. Please tell me,
what's wrong?

1030
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,487
Roshni, what's wrong with you?

1031
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:07,773
Roshni? Listen to me.

1032
01:16:08,097 --> 01:16:09,470
Roshni, please!

1033
01:16:10,172 --> 01:16:11,285
Please tell me what happened.

1034
01:16:11,405 --> 01:16:13,462
Why the hell is everyone concerned
about me

1035
01:16:13,487 --> 01:16:15,428
not having a child?
- Who has spoken these words?

1036
01:16:15,868 --> 01:16:17,382
First, your sister. Now, aunty.

1037
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:20,150
What's their problem? It's my life.
- Just calm down.

1038
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:21,138
You are just overreacting.

1039
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:23,365
I am overreacting?
So you think this is fine?

1040
01:16:23,398 --> 01:16:24,670
I am not saying this is fine.

1041
01:16:24,695 --> 01:16:26,660
So, what are you saying may I know?
- Don't shout.

1042
01:16:26,733 --> 01:16:29,075
Why shouldn't I shout?
Should I tell everyone?

1043
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,258
Should I?
- What do you want to say?

1044
01:16:30,355 --> 01:16:32,408
That it's your bloody defective
sperms.

1045
01:16:32,528 --> 01:16:34,213
Just shut up.
- Why should I shut up?

1046
01:16:34,852 --> 01:16:37,198
Am I saying something wrong?
Everyone should know that you

1047
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:40,830
don't have the guts to have someone
else's. - Yes, I don't want to.

1048
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:43,597
Rather I have my own blood.
Do you understand that?

1049
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:45,920
Yes, of course.

1050
01:16:46,883 --> 01:16:50,192
The Royal Blood.
The Royal Blood my foot.

1051
01:16:51,748 --> 01:16:53,945
Just like a father.
The blood flows...

1052
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:55,040
Don't utter a single word.

1053
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:10,223
Come now. Come. Let's go get some.

1054
01:17:10,872 --> 01:17:12,255
Raja, come join for dinner.

1055
01:17:17,153 --> 01:17:22,028
Please don't mind
if I exaggerate a bit.

1056
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:23,747
Okay?

1057
01:17:24,353 --> 01:17:28,503
You see. Do you know what

1058
01:17:28,623 --> 01:17:30,093
makes me so happy?

1059
01:17:31,573 --> 01:17:34,828
That you are all

1060
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:37,012
so busy.

1061
01:17:37,628 --> 01:17:41,455
That in spite of all
your commitments,

1062
01:17:41,963 --> 01:17:44,125
all of you came.

1063
01:17:45,552 --> 01:17:47,043
That you cared.

1064
01:17:48,223 --> 01:17:51,790
This is what gladdened me the most.

1065
01:17:53,465 --> 01:17:57,595
We are all aware this is the era
of nuclear families.

1066
01:17:58,223 --> 01:18:01,315
Everyone is scattered,
dispersed, disbanded.

1067
01:18:03,025 --> 01:18:07,035
Everything has changed.
Take this house, for instance.

1068
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:10,610
This was such a
happening place when

1069
01:18:10,635 --> 01:18:13,128
the entire Basu clan
lived under this roof.

1070
01:18:14,693 --> 01:18:18,908
This special day.

1071
01:18:19,698 --> 01:18:21,125
This anniversary.

1072
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:24,000
It's just an excuse, really.

1073
01:18:25,298 --> 01:18:26,920
This excuse is...

1074
01:18:34,608 --> 01:18:35,623
Hello.

1075
01:18:38,207 --> 01:18:39,255
What?

1076
01:18:40,477 --> 01:18:45,072
No, we are not returning tonight.
We'll be back tomorrow morning.

1077
01:18:47,158 --> 01:18:52,540
No, I didn't get drenched.
My throat is a bit scratchy.

1078
01:18:55,655 --> 01:18:56,822
Give him the phone.

1079
01:18:59,005 --> 01:19:00,043
Yes, dear.

1080
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:05,773
No. We are not coming home tonight.
Be a sweetheart and go off to bed.

1081
01:19:05,893 --> 01:19:08,335
We'll be there when you get up
in the morning. Okay?

1082
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:12,498
Yes, dad will be there as well.

1083
01:19:15,048 --> 01:19:16,810
Do you want to talk to him?

1084
01:19:18,195 --> 01:19:19,243
Hold on.

1085
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,290
Yes, dear. We will be there.

1086
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:28,670
We'll bring candy.

1087
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:33,383
Off to bed, now. Okay, honey?
We'll talk later.

1088
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:35,318
So sorry.

1089
01:19:36,627 --> 01:19:39,718
Roshni, why are you so far
from me? Come closer.

1090
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:41,622
Come.

1091
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:45,600
Come.

1092
01:19:47,698 --> 01:19:50,540
You belong here. Next to him.

1093
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:57,255
This place is vacant.
- Go on. What were you saying?

1094
01:19:58,110 --> 01:20:00,748
No, not much left to say.

1095
01:20:01,883 --> 01:20:03,860
Just that,

1096
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:07,665
she's been on my side

1097
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:11,665
these fifty years.

1098
01:20:12,942 --> 01:20:15,353
That is my biggest award.

1099
01:20:17,353 --> 01:20:19,083
I feel so contented today.

1100
01:20:21,913 --> 01:20:22,865
And

1101
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:27,947
I know you think of me
as traditionalist.

1102
01:20:29,007 --> 01:20:32,337
So as a traditional, let me say,

1103
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:36,303
those starting on life's journey,

1104
01:20:37,785 --> 01:20:39,635
I am reminded of something.

1105
01:20:40,835 --> 01:20:44,845
The bearded bare Tagore said,

1106
01:20:45,893 --> 01:20:48,532
Life's up and downs,

1107
01:20:49,785 --> 01:20:51,970
live through them with a smile.

1108
01:20:53,257 --> 01:20:55,667
Fill your heart forever with honey

1109
01:20:56,997 --> 01:20:58,910
from Him stream.

1110
01:21:00,283 --> 01:21:01,548
Beautiful.

1111
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:11,280
Let's begin.

1112
01:21:18,752 --> 01:21:20,935
Tublu, have this. It's good.
- Take some more.

1113
01:21:21,477 --> 01:21:25,455
I know you like chicken.
Start with that.

1114
01:21:26,742 --> 01:21:29,152
After all, this is your first
visit to this house.

1115
01:21:29,617 --> 01:21:31,833
Another cause for celebration,
isn't it?

1116
01:21:33,973 --> 01:21:36,568
Don't feel down. It'll be okay.
- Pompi.

1117
01:21:37,378 --> 01:21:38,585
Not returning home
tonight. Did your

1118
01:21:38,610 --> 01:21:40,020
mother-in-law scold you for that?

1119
01:21:40,385 --> 01:21:44,330
Why this long face? Eat up.
- I am.

1120
01:21:46,308 --> 01:21:47,878
The cooking is fantastic.

1121
01:21:47,973 --> 01:21:50,623
In that case, shouldn't you
be taking some more food?

1122
01:21:50,743 --> 01:21:53,475
I am. Want some salad? - So,
what do you call this fish dish?

1123
01:21:53,738 --> 01:21:56,635
It's probably not fish.
- What is it then?

1124
01:21:56,755 --> 01:22:00,592
Minced fish ball.
A signature dish in our family.

1125
01:22:00,712 --> 01:22:02,138
Go on, describe it for him.

1126
01:22:02,258 --> 01:22:05,943
You tell them.
- Amazing dish.

1127
01:22:06,462 --> 01:22:09,998
Take this. - Oh my God.
What are you doing?

1128
01:22:10,118 --> 01:22:12,625
Crazy, giving a widow fish to eat?

1129
01:22:12,852 --> 01:22:14,442
Sister,

1130
01:22:14,712 --> 01:22:16,110
why do you hold on to all that?

1131
01:22:16,135 --> 01:22:17,913
No one does anymore.
- I am sorry, dear. I do.

1132
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:19,847
Don't do that.
- I don't eat it.

1133
01:22:20,138 --> 01:22:25,458
Finish up your drink soon.
- Yes, I am just...

1134
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:35,465
Now you also come and eat.
- Yes. Coming.

1135
01:22:35,513 --> 01:22:38,378
Brother-in-law, one shouldn't
sing at the dinner table.

1136
01:22:38,403 --> 01:22:41,362
People go bonkers.
- No.

1137
01:22:41,705 --> 01:22:44,245
He can't go more crazy than

1138
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:47,500
he already is. - Actually, I was
singing for you folks.

1139
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:50,158
Since I am the known devil,
no one appreciates me.

1140
01:22:59,152 --> 01:23:01,368
Phatik, make sure

1141
01:23:01,607 --> 01:23:04,568
that the chauffeur and the
help get to eat as well. - Okay.

1142
01:23:06,418 --> 01:23:08,212
Look at this.
- I mean to say

1143
01:23:08,438 --> 01:23:11,877
one should retain the kid within.
- Why aren't you eating, Tublu?

1144
01:23:11,997 --> 01:23:14,655
Let me serve you.
- It will be done.

1145
01:23:15,823 --> 01:23:16,928
Here.

1146
01:23:17,707 --> 01:23:20,593
Manjari!

1147
01:23:21,145 --> 01:23:24,053
Hey. What are you doing here?

1148
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:26,523
They are having dinner.
Let's go now.

1149
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:29,190
Why all this feasting if
Prahlad can't join in?

1150
01:23:29,522 --> 01:23:32,960
Who the hell are you guys?

1151
01:23:33,315 --> 01:23:35,457
What kind of feast is this?

1152
01:23:36,128 --> 01:23:38,182
No dancing. No music.

1153
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:40,213
You call this a feast.

1154
01:23:40,505 --> 01:23:43,977
Am I new in Komolini?
- Who let this man in?

1155
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:46,538
Hadn't I been clear...
- I invited him.

1156
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:50,917
He wanted to meet aunty.
- Come, uncle. Let's go.

1157
01:23:51,338 --> 01:23:52,377
No, Pranab.

1158
01:23:57,367 --> 01:23:59,723
Do you have that piece of paper?

1159
01:24:01,528 --> 01:24:03,870
You know, when someone dies,

1160
01:24:03,895 --> 01:24:06,472
they give you a piece of paper
from municipality.

1161
01:24:07,128 --> 01:24:09,808
Do you have that for Sajal?
- Phatik.

1162
01:24:10,878 --> 01:24:14,425
It's okay. I will be on my way.

1163
01:24:15,052 --> 01:24:19,538
Fact is, I have been wanting
to visit Manjari.

1164
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:23,808
I was saying to Tublu...
You recall, Manjari?

1165
01:24:24,953 --> 01:24:26,888
You, Sajal and Tublu,

1166
01:24:27,797 --> 01:24:29,515
you would hang out
all day together.

1167
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:31,645
Sajal used to sing.

1168
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,813
Those memories are all I have.

1169
01:24:38,013 --> 01:24:40,088
What can I say, Prahlad?

1170
01:24:42,207 --> 01:24:45,925
I don't have the face to ask you
how you are doing. - This little

1171
01:24:46,433 --> 01:24:48,088
kindness from you,

1172
01:24:48,953 --> 01:24:50,618
I don't need

1173
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:55,667
to hear anymore.
- Come, let's go.

1174
01:25:05,948 --> 01:25:07,883
The chandelier has one bulb missing

1175
01:25:10,273 --> 01:25:12,727
and no one seems to care.

1176
01:25:31,897 --> 01:25:32,978
Who was Sajal?

1177
01:25:37,993 --> 01:25:39,130
Tell us, uncle.

1178
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:49,335
Not in the middle of dinner.
- Please, aunty.

1179
01:25:50,815 --> 01:25:52,103
You of all people,
don't say a word.

1180
01:25:53,952 --> 01:25:55,725
Let uncle tell us, who is Sajal?

1181
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:58,162
Stop it. Tublu.

1182
01:25:58,187 --> 01:26:00,323
Let uncle describe honours
and traditions of this family.

1183
01:26:09,285 --> 01:26:10,335
Tublu.

1184
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:13,243
You'd like to know who is Sajal,
right?

1185
01:26:13,675 --> 01:26:15,340
Sajal...

1186
01:26:16,098 --> 01:26:19,320
He is Prahlad uncle's only son.
Who was...

1187
01:26:24,142 --> 01:26:25,753
You are trying to whitewash
away everything.

1188
01:26:28,305 --> 01:26:30,368
That old man created a lot of
inconvenience, right?

1189
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:32,285
The picture perfect family...

1190
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:34,047
This is not the right
time to talk about all this.

1191
01:26:34,072 --> 01:26:35,205
Don't forget your place, kid.

1192
01:26:35,807 --> 01:26:38,195
Those phrases in English will
not exonerate your father.

1193
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:42,153
All this lording about...
This fragile aristocracy.

1194
01:26:42,802 --> 01:26:45,288
The true face is that old mansion.

1195
01:26:45,613 --> 01:26:48,953
Where Prahlad uncle spends years,
rotting and waiting for his son.

1196
01:26:50,370 --> 01:26:53,137
The son this Basu family...

1197
01:26:55,138 --> 01:26:57,018
You kicked him away from home,
uncle?

1198
01:26:58,425 --> 01:26:59,873
You felt no hesitation whatsoever?

1199
01:27:00,413 --> 01:27:03,613
Tublu. Please stop.
- Let go off me, mom.

1200
01:27:03,733 --> 01:27:05,983
Tell me, why did you guys
stop coming to this house?

1201
01:27:06,008 --> 01:27:08,523
Tublu. - No need to tell me.
Tell the new bride.

1202
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:11,322
I don't want to hear another
word against my father.

1203
01:27:11,442 --> 01:27:13,030
Hey, listen, brother.
- Shut up, brother.

1204
01:27:14,003 --> 01:27:16,393
Calm down. Let me handle this.

1205
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,900
Sajal's death was

1206
01:27:26,965 --> 01:27:28,435
an accident.

1207
01:27:31,765 --> 01:27:34,922
Accident? Is that so?

1208
01:27:36,025 --> 01:27:37,583
You had claimed you

1209
01:27:37,608 --> 01:27:39,865
were abroad at that time. So how
did you find out? Via a phone?

1210
01:27:42,025 --> 01:27:45,733
Brother, please.
Mom, take care of aunty.

1211
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:49,755
Please come. Wash up. Come with me,
please. - I am good.

1212
01:27:50,643 --> 01:27:52,913
I am fine.
- Tublu, please listen.

1213
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:02,810
Sister.

1214
01:28:28,635 --> 01:28:29,998
Shame on me.

1215
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:33,943
Please forgive me, everyone.

1216
01:28:34,268 --> 01:28:37,283
What are you saying?
Every family has its own drama.

1217
01:28:37,683 --> 01:28:40,430
It's okay.
- He really didn't want to come.

1218
01:28:42,493 --> 01:28:44,083
Had I not insisted, maybe
things would be better.

1219
01:28:47,553 --> 01:28:49,337
After his father passed away,

1220
01:28:50,515 --> 01:28:52,147
he took Sajal.

1221
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:55,758
I want to go travelling with Sajal.

1222
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:59,065
He is going to give me
voice lessons.

1223
01:29:00,190 --> 01:29:02,135
I will go fishing with him.

1224
01:29:02,623 --> 01:29:03,830
Fly kites together.

1225
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:09,132
I remember. Remember it all.

1226
01:29:11,368 --> 01:29:13,260
After the incident with Sajal,

1227
01:29:15,033 --> 01:29:16,525
he changed completely.

1228
01:29:17,683 --> 01:29:18,763
I think

1229
01:29:19,693 --> 01:29:21,178
he had figured it all out.

1230
01:29:21,298 --> 01:29:31,167
"My friend, where is he?"

1231
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:35,070
"This separation"
- Isn't that Tublu?

1232
01:29:35,448 --> 01:29:41,643
"burns me up."

1233
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:47,590
"It burns me up"

1234
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,243
"wherever I go."

1235
01:29:54,173 --> 01:30:00,650
"My friend."

1236
01:30:01,265 --> 01:30:06,347
"Where is he?"

1237
01:30:06,703 --> 01:30:10,335
"Where? Where?"

1238
01:30:11,612 --> 01:30:21,417
"Me, I will perish,"

1239
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:27,590
"separated from him"

1240
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:31,592
"wherever I go."

1241
01:30:32,835 --> 01:30:37,603
"Where is he,"

1242
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:42,252
"my friend?"

1243
01:30:44,858 --> 01:30:51,150
"My friend."

1244
01:30:51,753 --> 01:30:56,813
"Only had I known,"

1245
01:30:57,288 --> 01:31:01,008
"that we would get separated."

1246
01:31:02,543 --> 01:31:07,505
"Only had I known,"

1247
01:31:07,893 --> 01:31:11,720
"that we would get separated."

1248
01:31:12,922 --> 01:31:22,780
"Then I would have made sure"

1249
01:31:23,905 --> 01:31:28,628
"that I never let him go."

1250
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:32,727
"Where is he, my friend?"

1251
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:38,985
"Where is he,"

1252
01:31:39,505 --> 01:31:43,440
"my friend?"

1253
01:31:46,198 --> 01:31:52,748
"My friend."

1254
01:31:53,215 --> 01:31:58,177
"I tell my friend"

1255
01:31:58,675 --> 01:32:02,632
"that I am"

1256
01:32:03,647 --> 01:32:13,247
"burning from inside."

1257
01:32:14,598 --> 01:32:19,560
"My heart is aching, my friend."

1258
01:32:20,047 --> 01:32:23,572
"Where is he?"

1259
01:32:25,203 --> 01:32:29,765
"Where is he,"

1260
01:32:30,502 --> 01:32:33,615
"my friend?"

1261
01:34:20,983 --> 01:34:22,497
You haven't turned the lights on?

1262
01:34:39,015 --> 01:34:40,735
The rains did come as predicted.

1263
01:34:48,918 --> 01:34:50,453
Fifty years.

1264
01:34:53,123 --> 01:34:54,518
It's a long period of time.

1265
01:34:58,388 --> 01:34:59,610
And yet, too short.

1266
01:35:03,977 --> 01:35:06,225
How did all this time manage
to escape?

1267
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:09,437
Hmm.

1268
01:35:13,783 --> 01:35:14,960
What do you mean, hmm?

1269
01:35:24,778 --> 01:35:25,935
Manjari,

1270
01:35:28,108 --> 01:35:30,767
fifty fifty years is enough time

1271
01:35:32,172 --> 01:35:34,690
to understand the meaning of hmm.

1272
01:35:38,508 --> 01:35:39,590
Fact is,

1273
01:35:41,103 --> 01:35:43,038
I can't get that song off my mind.

1274
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:47,318
Song? You mean

1275
01:35:49,243 --> 01:35:51,080
the song Tublu was singing?

1276
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,150
He has always been a good singer.

1277
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:57,998
Just like his dad.

1278
01:36:00,993 --> 01:36:02,300
Just like Sajal.

1279
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:07,912
He picked the song up from Sajal.

1280
01:36:09,425 --> 01:36:10,830
Really? From Sajal?

1281
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:17,435
The first few months after marriage
when I came into this mansion,

1282
01:36:19,113 --> 01:36:22,680
I was very lonesome.

1283
01:36:23,468 --> 01:36:25,955
Of course, everyone
showered me with affection.

1284
01:36:26,910 --> 01:36:31,428
Your father, your brother and
sister. And yet, there was this...

1285
01:36:32,977 --> 01:36:36,923
And these were days when you spent
most of your time in Kolkata.

1286
01:36:41,927 --> 01:36:46,230
Sajal, he had this earthly
quality to him.

1287
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:51,128
We would go for walks
near the pond.

1288
01:36:53,182 --> 01:36:57,603
Pluck mangoes and flowers.
And sing together.

1289
01:36:58,738 --> 01:37:00,608
Me, Sajal and Tublu.

1290
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:04,332
Though I knew I was
the bride of the lord's family

1291
01:37:04,357 --> 01:37:06,763
and he was a
son of a commoner. Still.

1292
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:13,950
Honestly, Sajal had such
an amazing voice.

1293
01:37:14,652 --> 01:37:16,500
He left me mesmerised.

1294
01:37:18,468 --> 01:37:20,330
Then suddenly one day,
you told me we were to

1295
01:37:20,355 --> 01:37:22,405
leave for England
immediately for your work.

1296
01:37:24,965 --> 01:37:27,550
Once he heard the news,
Sajal broke down.

1297
01:37:29,237 --> 01:37:31,193
He would say, Manjari,

1298
01:37:32,707 --> 01:37:35,615
if you leave, who will I sing for?

1299
01:37:40,567 --> 01:37:45,680
And then, the night before we
were to leave,

1300
01:37:47,463 --> 01:37:49,323
it was Ulta Rath that
night as well.

1301
01:37:50,263 --> 01:37:52,448
It was raining much like tonight.

1302
01:37:55,205 --> 01:37:59,670
The boy stayed up all night through
the rain soaked to his skin,

1303
01:38:00,935 --> 01:38:02,275
singing to me.

1304
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:06,998
The song that Tublu
was singing tonight, that one.

1305
01:38:09,798 --> 01:38:11,420
Not once did I come to the window.

1306
01:38:13,128 --> 01:38:15,203
I somehow knew he was there,
waiting for me.

1307
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,445
Even then I didn't.
Not even for once.

1308
01:38:19,408 --> 01:38:22,210
All of a sudden, hearing that song
again...

1309
01:38:22,235 --> 01:38:24,103
Not out of the blue, Manjari.

1310
01:38:27,073 --> 01:38:28,133
As in?

1311
01:38:30,133 --> 01:38:33,177
The decision to leave for England.

1312
01:38:33,202 --> 01:38:34,622
It wasn't something I
decided all of a sudden.

1313
01:38:37,788 --> 01:38:39,917
I knew.

1314
01:38:41,008 --> 01:38:42,123
What did you know?

1315
01:38:43,118 --> 01:38:45,030
There had been some gossip.

1316
01:38:48,772 --> 01:38:50,533
Some of it reached my father.

1317
01:38:52,847 --> 01:38:55,635
There was talk of needing
to protect the family heritage.

1318
01:38:58,273 --> 01:38:59,312
Besides,

1319
01:39:02,123 --> 01:39:03,788
I had seen the two of you together.

1320
01:39:05,193 --> 01:39:06,977
How come you've never
brought it up?

1321
01:39:07,453 --> 01:39:08,847
I didn't.

1322
01:39:12,090 --> 01:39:13,258
The reason

1323
01:39:16,770 --> 01:39:17,928
being pride.

1324
01:39:21,268 --> 01:39:23,583
The new bride of this family

1325
01:39:25,150 --> 01:39:27,755
being seen with an ordinary
caretaker's son.

1326
01:39:28,425 --> 01:39:29,517
I couldn't

1327
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:32,415
bring it up. In fact,

1328
01:39:33,063 --> 01:39:34,815
I wounded my self-esteem.

1329
01:39:35,692 --> 01:39:37,897
After that...
- You never

1330
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,388
understood me.
- I decided without

1331
01:39:43,302 --> 01:39:45,540
asking you to leave for England.

1332
01:39:49,508 --> 01:39:53,085
And because of all this,

1333
01:39:54,017 --> 01:39:57,443
if someone kills himself.
Surely, I am not to be blamed.

1334
01:39:59,607 --> 01:40:02,752
That crime, that's not on me.

1335
01:40:03,898 --> 01:40:06,287
But you said that

1336
01:40:06,957 --> 01:40:11,822
he fell from the roof top of the
old mansion and it was an accident.

1337
01:40:15,075 --> 01:40:16,135
Manjari.

1338
01:40:19,033 --> 01:40:22,945
Fifty years has gone by.

1339
01:40:25,735 --> 01:40:27,865
All these while,

1340
01:40:28,643 --> 01:40:30,795
things have been fine.

1341
01:40:35,150 --> 01:40:38,188
Things were all fine? Really?

1342
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:46,708
Souren,

1343
01:42:47,658 --> 01:42:48,793
well,

1344
01:42:50,038 --> 01:42:53,550
if you don't object, maybe...

1345
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:57,203
This winter,

1346
01:42:58,793 --> 01:43:01,680
you and me... Together...

1347
01:43:03,788 --> 01:43:07,160
I mean... Can we go

1348
01:43:09,993 --> 01:43:11,258
and get Chiku?

1349
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:33,885
So it rained after all.

1350
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:36,900
Well. It is a well known fact

1351
01:43:37,678 --> 01:43:39,615
that it rains on this
auspicious day of Ulta Rath.

1352
01:43:42,112 --> 01:43:46,188
The day when Sajal stood outside
the window for Manjari

1353
01:43:46,858 --> 01:43:48,642
and drenched himself in the rain,

1354
01:43:50,565 --> 01:43:53,518
was it raining like this as it is
today?

1355
01:43:56,047 --> 01:43:58,900
The call of death which
pulled Sajal,

1356
01:44:00,673 --> 01:44:05,710
was it due to his unrequited love
for Manjari?

1357
01:44:07,408 --> 01:44:09,550
I don't know the answers
to these questions.

1358
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:13,917
But this much I could realise today

1359
01:44:14,912 --> 01:44:16,003
that we may

1360
01:44:17,235 --> 01:44:19,182
remain entangled in this

1361
01:44:19,970 --> 01:44:22,888
small circle of life.

1362
01:44:25,493 --> 01:44:28,975
But that has no effect
on the rhythms of nature.

1363
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:33,732
Even a curse from the past
comes and

1364
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:37,970
haunts us as if to remind us
that in

1365
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:40,963
this vastness of life,
there is a truth

1366
01:44:42,283 --> 01:44:45,623
that is beyond the personal trials

1367
01:44:46,673 --> 01:44:49,202
and tribulations of mankind.

1368
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:55,993
The fact that after 50 years
of married life with Manjari,

1369
01:44:57,930 --> 01:45:00,167
I can realise this ultimate truth.

1370
01:45:01,658 --> 01:45:03,097
That is my real cause

1371
01:45:04,233 --> 01:45:05,875
of celebration today.

1372
01:45:08,318 --> 01:45:10,102
The fragility of my pride
of our ancestry,

1373
01:45:11,443 --> 01:45:13,518
the fading pride of a
nebulous past.

1374
01:45:14,783 --> 01:45:17,400
Even the crevices in my apartment,

1375
01:45:17,963 --> 01:45:19,368
success makes me realise today.

1376
01:45:20,860 --> 01:45:22,578
A realisation much

1377
01:45:23,313 --> 01:45:25,043
larger than all that embraces me,

1378
01:45:26,318 --> 01:45:28,535
and the rain, as if,

1379
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:32,655
serves as a reminder to all this.

1380
01:45:38,850 --> 01:45:46,698
"It's raining."

1381
01:45:46,818 --> 01:45:50,655
"The clouds are pouring."

1382
01:45:50,893 --> 01:45:56,180
"It's the monsoon season."

1383
01:45:56,300 --> 01:45:59,940
"Cool breeze is flowing."

1384
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:04,233
"It's raining."

1385
01:46:04,353 --> 01:46:12,990
"It's raining."

1386
01:46:13,110 --> 01:46:20,202
"The clouds are pouring."

1387
01:46:20,322 --> 01:46:25,567
"The lightning strikes."

1388
01:46:25,687 --> 01:46:30,838
"The lightning strikes."

1389
01:46:31,048 --> 01:46:36,185
"The wind is flowing."

1390
01:46:36,305 --> 01:46:41,568
"The lightning strikes."

1391
01:46:41,688 --> 01:46:46,713
"The lightning strikes."

1392
01:46:46,995 --> 01:46:51,838
"The wind is flowing."

1393
01:46:51,958 --> 01:46:58,658
"It's thundering loudly."

1394
01:46:58,778 --> 01:47:05,015
"It's raining."

1395
01:47:05,362 --> 01:47:10,508
