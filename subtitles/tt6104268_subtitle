Radio: With 'Twisted News',
Big B & Murugan are here.

26
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,451
Is not just a shocking news;

27
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,522
Gosh! Who is going to get that?

28
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:29,038
Ayikkara's ex-M LA Advocate
Ramanunni who was expelled from CDP.

29
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,656
When a young leader smart with
puns, gets a gun; what would he do?

30
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:33,986
He'll do a lot of things.

31
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,283
But Ramanunni is afraid of someone.

32
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,028
Why is he afraid?

33
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,566
'Cucumber Town' is
waiting for that.

34
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,326
Fear is good.

35
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,723
Ramanunni's meeting with the district
Collector is scheduled at 10.30 AM.

36
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:57,037
This meeting is just a procedure
instructed by the Indian Arms Act,

37
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,593
to allow the possession of a
licensed gun for self-defence.

38
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,148
It is expected that Ramanunni
would arrive with police protection.

39
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,122
When they promised tight security,
I didn't think it would be so tight!

40
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,162
Didn't I say that we'll get a
taxi from the railway station, Sir?

41
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,080
To make you pay so much money..

42
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,379
But this would be only around
40-50 Rupees. You have it, right?

43
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,381
You're not used to
paying money, right?

44
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:37,033
So, I have the money to pay
this rickshaw here with me.

45
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,342
- The entire media is here.
Don't stop in front of them.

46
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:43,672
Stop here.

47
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,169
Stop! Stop!

48
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,027
What are you doing?

49
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,099
What's your name?

50
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,989
I'm really happy that
you stopped right here.

51
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,311
It will be exciting only when
these TV people are around!

52
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,237
Oh! I'm happy!
- We shall meet somewhere.

53
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,283
Get down, sir.

54
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:13,639
Move, I say.

55
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:15,951
Make way.

56
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,882
Did you stay silent till now because
the party's allegations on you were true?

57
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,272
I'll tell you in detail.

58
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,460
Move! Move!

59
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,828
Isn't this gun license a
publicity stunt, Mister?

60
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,135
It is to avoid a public stunt.

61
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:36,992
Will you use the gun?

62
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,981
Shouldn't I protect my
life myself, Chandran?

63
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,417
Or else, I should have had a
fiery brother-in-law like you.

64
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,058
But now, you don't have a
sister whom I can marry, right?

65
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,420
Are you actually afraid
of a murder attempt?

66
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,784
I've slept there for a long time;

67
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,098
I would at least be
a martyr if I die.

68
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,865
There won't even be a witness!

69
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,346
A warning that anyone who's
scared of losing their own lives,

70
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,322
Give me protection!

71
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,119
In this situation, this would
definitely be controversial.

72
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,923
But, the documents
are all supportive.

73
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,046
There are 12 FIRs about
phone threats itself!

74
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,494
And,

75
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,955
Moreover, it's also a plus point
that your father is a martyr.

76
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:58,623
No. That's not there.

77
00:08:59,071 --> 00:08:59,891
He was murdered.

78
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,272
Okay Mr. Ramanunni.

79
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,392
After that, you
can receive the gun.

80
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,888
Who was expelled from the
Communist Democratic Party,

81
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,984
Palakkad District
Collector has granted him

82
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,340
the license to possess
a gun for self-defence.

83
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,566
The officials have informed that the
license has been granted for a revolver.

84
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:29,427
Ending the speculations that Ramanunni
would join the opposite party NSP,

85
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:35,039
NSP's state president, Sagar Nagamadom
had a meeting with Ramanunni at the TB.

86
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,465
When they came out
after the discussion,

87
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,727
both of them claimed that their discussion
was just a friendly conversation.

88
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,824
We have decided to
go forward, together.

89
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,444
Okay then.
- Namaste.

90
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:53,601
Long Live The Revolution!

91
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:57,023
Hail CDP!

92
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,093
Ramanunni, you traitor!

93
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,996
We will deal with you soon!

94
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:13,422
This party has grown by shedding
blood & sacrificing lives!

95
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:19,057
Long Live The Revolution!

96
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,152
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

97
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:24,986
Stop it, I say!

98
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,831
I said stop it!

99
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,590
What nonsense are you doing?

100
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,412
This is not just Ramanunni's house;

101
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,126
it is Comrade
Ragini's house as well.

102
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,425
You keep throwing! This is
Ramanunni's house as well.

103
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,287
Long Live The Revolution!

104
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,735
Long Live Comrade Ragini!

105
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,091
Long Live CDP!

106
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,897
Ramanunni & NSP leaders had a
meeting earlier today at the TB.

107
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,445
He has insulted his
father's martyrdom.

108
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,792
He has insulted my womb.

109
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,077
A renegade who
betrayed his own party!

110
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,049
As NSP's candidate, against Communist
Democratic Party, are increasing.

111
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:17,325
What do you say?

112
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,943
Communists have a tradition
of fighting against renegades,

113
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,306
even if they are related by blood.

114
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,488
If Ramanunni is NSP's candidate,

115
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,044
I will be there in the front row to
fight against that political eunuch.

116
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:33,065
Anyway, this Ayikkara by-election
is sure to startle Kerala politics.

117
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,809
What would be Ramanunni's
political future...

118
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,439
Who is that old hag, Sir?

119
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,040
That old hag is my mother
who gave birth to me!

120
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,239
Oops. Sorry sir.
I didn't know that.

121
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,374
Did it hurt?
- No, sir.

122
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,188
No?
- It's slightly hurting now, Sir.

123
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:52,928
Good boy!

124
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,710
For the time being, it's fine.

125
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,984
And send a trustworthy guy
to drive the car as well.

126
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,617
Don't we need cash
to spend, Rawuther?

127
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,996
It's politics! Can we spend
our own money for this?

128
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,912
When bars were open,
it wasn't so difficult.

129
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,033
What? There's nothing to be fixed.

130
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,254
Ramanunni Sir will
be NSP's candidate.

131
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,244
Just close your eyes &
give the money, Rawuther.

132
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,234
What?
- Oh ya! Long Live India.

133
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,468
Namaste. I am TC.

134
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,985
Thomas Chacko. The state general
secretary of the youth wing.

135
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:31,973
What?
- Not that.

136
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,051
There are 9 general
secretaries. I'm one among them.

137
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,963
To explain NSP's
procedures to you, Sir.

138
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,573
I have a mahout's role.

139
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,487
Please don't disobey, sir.

140
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,107
TC..
- Yes.

141
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,362
Addressing someone as 'Sir' is
subjective in this party, sir.

142
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,836
Of if there is a chance to rise,

143
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,843
Otherwise, it's just 'son',
'dear', 'idiot' and all that.

144
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,050
So, that address
can change any time.

145
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,756
Don't worry. There won't be
any swearing at your father.

146
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,460
Good! This should be there.

147
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,160
That usual constipated expression;

148
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,930
Sir, the fit is fine, right?

149
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,155
Shall I leave?
- Okay.

150
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,176
Here, sir.

151
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:26,581
Yes!

152
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,979
Hey! You may go.
Ask Majid to call me.

153
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:39,847
Lesson 1 .

154
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:42,887
Should be there on your face.

155
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,214
Meeting is at 10 AM; but you
should reach there only at 10.30.

156
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,431
Oh! Lesson 2, right?

157
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,044
Well, I should know
everything about you, right?

158
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,105
I had, but I stopped now.

159
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,358
Communism.

160
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,178
Yes. 55 Biriyanis.

161
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,217
35 Chicken & 20 Mutton.

162
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,604
What?

163
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,216
This core committee meeting is
just a function for the sake of it.

164
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,406
Sagar Sir's decision will be final.

165
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,322
One of Sagar Sir's agendas
is to tame Udayabhanu.

166
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,037
Pushpan.

167
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,033
How long have you been
working for Rawuther?

168
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,359
Are you into politics?

169
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,135
That's good!

170
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,329
That's how you should be!

171
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,907
Make a living by
working hard, okay?

172
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,052
Okay sir.

173
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,763
Why do you have to get
cursed by the people?

174
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,854
Udayabhanu who lost to you
in the previous election,

175
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,959
will campaign for you to get
votes in this by-election.

176
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,163
That's good.

177
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,504
The people deserve that!

178
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,188
In this situation,

179
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,853
this is just a thought considering the
chances of success in the by-election.

180
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,408
As Palakkad District President,

181
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,073
let Udayabhanu talk first.

182
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,916
To make this party
survive in the district.

183
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,163
It's not with the
non-violence of you people,

184
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,688
who see that there's no soil or
blood on the whites that you wear;

185
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,614
This Udayabhanu created an address
for this party in the district,

186
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,039
I haven't sent people to do anything
by giving them money & alcohol!

187
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,066
I have done things directly!

188
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,260
Many things that you
may be scared to hear.

189
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,053
When I lost a leg,

190
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,888
there are many here, who had tears
in their eyes because of grief.

191
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:27,622
But I realized only later that their grief
was because my head wasn't chopped off.

192
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,430
Or even speak a couple
of lines on the roads;

193
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,013
From a time when those comrades
didn't allow any of these;

194
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,988
I took all this to a level

195
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,870
where we can hold a district
convention of 2 lakh people.

196
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,093
Bhanu, everyone
knows all this, right?

197
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,712
I an": reminding, President.
I an": just reminding!

198
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,239
That is, in our town,
there's a saying;

199
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,999
'If you carry a person who
shat, even you would stink'

200
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:53,964
You also would have heard it.

201
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,997
Whoever came up with the idea
of me supporting this Ramanunni;

202
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,650
Let me tell you, President.
That's gonna be in vain!

203
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,043
Oops. I'm sorry.

204
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,316
I won't repeat it, sir. I swear.

205
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,244
Namaste. Namaste to everyone.

206
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,245
Last time,

207
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:21,989
I lost to this Comrade
Ramanunni just for 1400 votes.

208
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,465
This time, whoever the
candidate of CDP is,

209
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,767
it's sure that I would win
for at least 10,000 votes.

210
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,883
This is just a discussion
regarding the by-election.

211
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,787
Leave it, President!
Discussion, it seems!

212
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,199
What image does this Ramanunni
have in this constituency?

213
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,900
He is someone who
betrayed his own party,

214
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:46,122
which raised him, educated him,
made him an advocate and even an MLA!

215
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,902
To quote his mother,
he's a renegade!

216
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:58,038
And the workers who campaigned aggressively
against this Ramanunni last time;

217
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,847
If you tell them to work
for Ramanunni this time;

218
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,200
All this is part of politics;
forget everything else;

219
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:06,881
But I can't do that.

220
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,130
To stand here like this.

221
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,890
When people at home
can't even eat porridge;

222
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,703
if a guest is offered Biriyani;

223
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,551
No doubt about that.

224
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,545
I haven't asked for a Biriyani;

225
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,510
and no one has offered
it to me here as well.

226
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,043
I was invited to this party.

227
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,450
When you talk, I have to
get that consideration.

228
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,784
I studied in a Government
Malayalam Medium School.

229
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,437
From the money that my
mother made by rolling beedis;

230
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,197
I studied with the little money that
was left after paying levy to the party.

231
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,940
I bought the coat & gown
to enrol as an advocate,

232
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,043
with 10,000 Rupees that
my mother took as a loan,

233
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,131
from the Beedi workers'
co-operative society.

234
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,834
And, why the party gave
me a seat to contest.

235
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,869
It is because, in a land which celebrates
a martyr's day for Comrade Raghavan yearly;

236
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:30,269
the chances of that martyr's son's
success was much more than anyone else.

237
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,696
It was that emotion in the constituency
which made Bhanu Sir lose for 1400 votes;

238
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,474
It might be difficult for you
to ask votes for me, Bhanu Sir.

239
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:46,148
I don't have any difficulty in
asking votes for you, Bhanu Sir.

240
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,911
By the hands of the
people of this party!

241
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:03,077
Still,

242
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,782
I don't have any difficulty to work for
this party wearing this Khadi attire;

243
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,431
And because of my belief that
there's nothing wrong in it.

244
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,055
Udayabhanu, we haven't
taken any decisions yet.

245
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,675
You started this meeting after
taking all the decisions, right?

246
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,938
I am not joining to
applaud. That's all.

247
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,979
Sir, how was his performance? Did it work?
- It was great.

248
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,451
It was your coaching, is it?

249
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,852
If you ask me to do something,
I should do it well, right?

250
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,265
Good job.

251
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,677
There will be an official announcement
tomorrow, about your candidate-ship.

252
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,217
When you give speeches outside,

253
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,082
and in party meetings;

254
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,204
you should highlight the
things you mentioned earlier.

255
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,836
Malayalam medium school;
your mom's beedi rolling;

256
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,202
Sir, can you phrase
it more decently?

257
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,741
It sounds like you are swearing at him.
- Is it?

258
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,934
So your mom's job,
that is beedi rolling.

259
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,894
The loan from
co-operative society;

260
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,561
You can be a little more emotional.

261
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,331
Sir, I'll make sure of that.

262
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,941
We should turn everything
into votes. Everything!

263
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,417
Making people laugh
is not our intention.

264
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,303
Come! There are a lot
more things to do! Come!

265
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,096
Go and check.

266
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,135
Dad, you won!

267
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,033
You have come with a
bottle of Vodka for me.

268
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,374
I didn't know. I'll
get it delivered.

269
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:31,682
No.

270
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,330
He meant that he got a bottle
of vodka because you came now.

271
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:35,683
A bet.

272
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,242
He was speaking metaphorically.

273
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,333
It was one week back.

274
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:40,988
I said that you
would come to see me.

275
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:44,862
And you've come before that.

276
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,119
Silver.

277
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:01,173
Well, when did you start
practising this sixth sense?

278
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,044
It has been 18 years since I
was expelled from the party.

279
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,061
And all of them have met me
within a week of their expulsion.

280
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,828
Now do you know what's the
secret behind the sixth sense?

281
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,396
I haven't come here because
I had a similar fate;

282
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:20,596
You are a columnist and political
observer with a lot of readers, right?

283
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,413
I came to seek help.

284
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,054
Ideological?

285
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,023
No.

286
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,062
Whatever party policy it may be, I
don't think that decision was right!

287
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,889
That's exactly why I didn't raise my
hand at the subject committee meeting.

288
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,393
And you were sent there to
raise your hand for that!

289
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:49,268
You can raise your hands for your
rights and wrongs back at your home!

290
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,241
In this district,
martyrdom is like..

291
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,057
A road accident.

292
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,989
An accident that happens
if you aren't careful.

293
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,039
There's a compensation that
the party gives for that.

294
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,751
We would name a library or
protest cabinet after the martyr.

295
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:13,928
Assembly seat.

296
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,413
So, don't supply any more
of your ideologies to me.

297
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:22,287
Your father had a bad habit
of having such ideologies.

298
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,897
We didn't have to
tolerate him much!

299
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,485
The party has a ration system now.

300
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,097
That's awesome!

301
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,986
Was that so bad that
you had to kick him?

302
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,166
I lost control for a second.

303
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,840
If you aren't interested in
black tea, the poison is ready!

304
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:02,586
That will be great!

305
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:09,483
No.    www.TamilMV.re

306
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,189
Then you can start now.

307
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,774
I also started
after being expelled.

308
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,442
Since people close to me
were all from the party,

309
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,368
when I was expelled, I turned into
a 'Yatheem Khana' brand orphan.

310
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,703
Me, who was only experienced in
writing party committee minutes;

311
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,172
was approached to write a column,
by the mother of all newspapers!

312
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,799
They were adamant on turning
him into a Shakespeare.

313
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,783
None of this bourgeois
set-up is mine.

314
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,099
It's all her savings!

315
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,293
This anti-marriage girl.

316
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:56,096
Do you know?

317
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,213
But since I was proud of
my own father, I didn't go.

318
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,616
So smoothly you swore at my father!

319
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:15,382
Sir,

320
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,042
until everything turns normal,

321
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,092
That's NSP.

322
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,512
Yes. It's ready!

323
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,229
Ayikkara & Ramanunni
are the topics.

324
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:45,579
Will he kill me?

325
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,491
Your request has worked out.

326
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,127
Phew! That's a relief.

327
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,101
MY name, right?

328
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,102
Helena.

329
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,902
But, I don't make buildings.
- Then?

330
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,242
Did you see that?

331
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,937
Floor designing for
reality shows on channels.

332
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,600
Art direction!

333
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,122
Since my behaviour is very good,

334
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,152
Nice!

335
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:31,965
Sorry. I thought it was water.

336
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,057
Anyway you've tasted
it. Go ahead & finish it!

337
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,563
No! No!

338
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,157
It's a time when I have to be
much more alert and in my senses.

339
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,434
So, I worked in different
channels as art director,

340
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,736
programme producer,
programme director, etc.

341
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:47,834
With that, she
stopped movies as well.

342
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,999
Now she's trying to
start an online channel.

343
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,236
Yes. A different approach.

344
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,580
So you're quite something!

345
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,200
Well, since you've
gotten to know each other;

346
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:03,891
There you go!

347
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,283
Hello! Where did you escape?
Aren't you coming back?

348
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,033
People from your
home-town are here.

349
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,627
Udayabhanu sir, Ambadi Mohanan,
Comrades and everyone else are here.

350
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,345
Oh gosh! He is drunk!

351
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,920
He is smoking as well!

352
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:45,562
And come back in the morning.

353
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,476
Do you have lights
for a beedi, Comrade?

354
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:58,495
He was mocking us!

355
00:29:58,763 --> 00:29:59,613
Yes!

356
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,578
I'll do the needful!

357
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,418
Ramanunni got stinking drunk
and landed in front of us.

358
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:17,998
What is this?

359
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,586
The step is not
staying at one place.

360
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,135
CDP.

361
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,342
NSP.

362
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,262
Let it be there!

363
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,342
Hey! Turn it off!

364
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,029
What's your problem?

365
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,492
Can't I take a selfie or what?

366
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,036
Like that!

367
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,948
You & your bloody selfie!

368
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:02,443
Delete it!

369
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,265
I asked you to delete it!

370
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,660
Take his mobile & delete
all the videos from it.

371
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:20,104
I'll point this to your Ambadi
Mohanan's forehead one day.

372
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,064
<i>Go! “'2?</i>

373
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:26,633
TC!

374
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,013
Don't we have a room in this place?

375
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,850
Don't hold me.

376
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,415
I am completely normal.

377
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,215
If we wear Khadi,

378
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,969
we have to be decent.

379
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:46,616
They would call anyway, right?

380
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,365
Exclusive! That's not enough.

381
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,100
If it's just that,
people won't believe it.

382
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,344
Let everyone come.

383
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,245
We just have to keep
watching as spectators.

384
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,138
Call them!

385
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:08,421
Shall I call the media, Comrade?
- No.

386
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:12,852
There's no point in stomping!

387
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,248
But Comrade,

388
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,569
pointing a gun is
a big deal, right?

389
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:17,904
We don't have proof, right?

390
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,121
That's his trick.

391
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:25,505
Don't fall for it.

392
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:30,484
This party has a tradition.

393
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,975
You have to respect the purity
of the Khadi while you wear it.

394
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,908
Getting drunk and
making people talk!

395
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,911
Scoundrels from both sides
are waiting for a reason!

396
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:41,861
Luckily no one else saw it.

397
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,340
Otherwise, there would have
been a media frenzy over here!

398
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,712
Pointing a gun at someone
is a non-bailable of fence!

399
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:51,351
Hey!

400
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,391
If you touch even a drop of
alcohol, you'll know my true colours!

401
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,266
Gun.

402
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,787
That's on the left
side. On the right?

403
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,780
The meaning of what I said is that,

404
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,122
when you drink, you should drink
without any fuss. That's all!

405
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,941
So you were just acting drunk, huh?

406
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,929
Keep this in the bathroom
& go open the door.

407
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,296
Media?

408
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,411
What is it?
- Ramanunni?

409
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:53,163
I'll call him. Sir!

410
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,376
I'm coming!
- He is coming.

411
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,253
There's a talk show
for a TV channel

412
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,239
Volga is the co-ordinator.

413
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,267
Well, why have you all
come here at this hour?

414
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:20,225
That Ramanunni got stinking drunk
and pointed a gun at a CDP worker.

415
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,200
I got stinking
drunk some time back?

416
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:25,879
What is all this, dude?

417
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,060
I don't know.

418
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,272
Do you have a breath analyser?

419
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,314
The thing that the police
makes your blow into.

420
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,186
It makes a sound like this.
- That's it.

421
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,945
Am I drunk?
- No sir.

422
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,769
Whom do you say that
I pointed a gun at?

423
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,039
While I was coming inside,

424
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,930
Ya. Those CDP workers were the
ones who were standing there.

425
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:57,058
Did I point a gun or
anything like that at you?

426
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:58,545
No! Not at all!

427
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,271
Well, who was your informer?

428
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,170
It was an anonymous call.

429
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,135
So you'll have the number,
right? Just call him back.

430
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:07,487
Here you go!

431
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,043
Most TV channels are here.
No need of any tension.

432
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,230
Just a second. I'm
getting another call.

433
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,168
Is it Mr. Anonymous?
- Anonymous?

434
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,147
Who is he?

435
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,246
Do you think Udayabhanu
sir is involved in this?

436
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,403
Udayabhanu Sir wouldn't
make a false allegation.

437
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,364
Anyway, he is in the next
room. Ask him directly!

438
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:47,307
Okay then. Good night!

439
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,831
Bhanu sir is sure to have
a bad name among them.

440
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,988
But Bhanu is a back-stabber.

441
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,019
You are the eyes
behind me, from now on.

442
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:16,483
I'm your disciple from now on!

443
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,102
You have much more tricks than
them in your pocket, right?

444
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,934
Hey! Shall we have a drink each?

445
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,044
Both of us?
- Yes!

446
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,790
So it's a complete transformation?

447
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,899
Won't you hear the
case before noon?

448
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,873
The Bombay High Court's judgement,

449
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:11,445
Sit down, man!

450
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:15,308
Hi sir. Please come.

451
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,290
Gosh! Don't kill me!

452
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,991
Why did you stand up?
- Just like that.

453
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,359
But since Ramanunni has
police protection currently,

454
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,382
after the Commission
declined the request,

455
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,569
Even with strong police protection,
many have been murdered, including VIPs;

456
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,313
the High Court agreed to
Ramanunni's appeal that

457
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,246
Bombay High Court's Govind alias
Bhai vls Vikram Kumar case's judgement

458
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:47,185
was relevant in his case as well.

459
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,067
Is it? I'll get it checked.

460
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:07,551
It won't take long, right?

461
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,988
The CCTV camera in the
guest room isn't working.

462
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:21,932
Ramanunni, what happened?

463
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,158
No!
- No one should go there. Move!

464
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,236
There's more space on the
wall of your house, right?

465
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,133
Click a photo where you're smiling.

466
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,203
No! Ramanunni! Stop, I say!

467
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:40,821
Even if a bit of this comes
on the internet or on mobiles,

468
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,034
What? What's the
problem, Ramanunni?

469
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,964
If Mohanan isn't there, it's okay.
We can do the programme with you.

470
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,865
What I have to say; let me say
that directly to my people first.

471
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:05,258
I'll come after that.

472
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:09,969
Well, what happened inside?

473
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,921
I'll tell you when you're
mature enough to know it.

474
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,068
My first public meeting
at Ayikkara on Wednesday!

475
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,722
Only me, you and Udayabhanu
will be on the stage.

476
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:20,881
But Bhanu Sir...

477
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,397
After the meeting, we'll
go directly to my house.

478
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:26,913
She is my mother!

479
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,864
That's okay! But if CDP
workers create any trouble?

480
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,189
Yes.

481
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,938
The police would be there
to take care of all that!

482
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:37,517
And let me tell you something;

483
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,132
don't ever ask such lame doubts!

484
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,238
Understood?
- Yes!

485
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,170
I am trapped in a tiger's den!

486
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:51,019
The official announcement was
made during a press conference,

487
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,299
at the guest house
around 4 PM this evening.

488
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,964
Since it is confirmed that
Ramanunni is NSP's candidate,

489
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:59,767
we can be sure that CDP will nominate
the strongest opponent against him.

490
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,418
There are reports from the
party circle suggesting that

491
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,433
district secretary Ambadi Mohanan
would be Ramanunni's opponent.

492
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,368
In the election,

493
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,146
Sagar knows that
we will cheat them.

494
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,690
He won't be bothered
even if Ramanunni loses.

495
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,983
A sword to strike me!

496
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,356
That's all Ramanunni is for him!

497
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:28,144
He should be burnt down to ashes.

498
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,190
And I want to smear that
ash on Sagar's forehead!

499
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:35,935
Even if we don't bring the people,

500
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:40,422
Anyway, with the announcement
and posters and everything,

501
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,065
let things be swell!

502
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:48,626
Advocate Ramanunni will address you
at the police station ground from 5 PM.

503
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,827
To make this meeting
a huge success,

504
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,743
I humbly invite all the
believers of democracy.

505
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,344
We will fight our
opponents politically;

506
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,895
that should be our policy
that's presented to the public.

507
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,842
So, at a public place,

508
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:11,658
no one should shout,
spit or poke Ramanunni.

509
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,205
If the workers do
something emotionally..

510
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,817
When they obey me when I say
that you have to do something,

511
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:20,976
they have to obey when I
ask them not to do anything.

512
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:25,326
None of us should create a
ruckus during his meeting.

513
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,067
Understood?

514
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:31,403
Well, when is your name
going to be declared, Comrade?

515
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,346
After his meeting.

516
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,371
Tonight 8 PM,

517
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,039
Eranadu Stallions vls
Thalassery Blockbusters.

518
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,045
When is the final match?
- On this 16th.

519
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,220
Yes.

520
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,026
If we resign,

521
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:54,372
or even if we just
think of resigning,

522
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:56,332
they will immediately expel us.

523
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:00,143
You know right?

524
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:05,344
Here's someone who threw away even
his MLA seat without caring a damn,

525
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,240
this Ramanunni!

526
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:12,203
It's because he couldn't tolerate
CDP's crooked political policies!

527
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,156
That's why we are saying that,

528
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,123
that ideological purity,

529
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,988
that's what made NSP
welcome Ramanunni.

530
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,382
Why do I have to say any more?

531
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,201
Now, Ramanunni will talk to you.

532
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,353
Hail Ramanunni!

533
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,806
Even if I start like that just
for this on time, it's okay.

534
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:41,176
Most of the people among those
who have gathered here, are them!

535
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:45,354
When I saw such a huge crowd,

536
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,498
'You have great public
support over here, man'.

537
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,182
'If they announce that I
have to be hanged to death,

538
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,994
there would be much more
people to watch that', said I.

539
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:57,627
Isn't that true?

540
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:02,697
I was named by my grandfather.

541
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,097
Ramanunni.

542
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:13,872
The new name is
- Renegade!

543
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:17,477
This"

544
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:21,185
Raman, Krishnan, Babu,
Varghese, Mohammed, Shashi..

545
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,932
Do these names belong
to only one person? No!

546
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,950
Has been assigned by that party
to many people earlier as well.

547
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,360
When I reach home tonight,
my mother will call me.

548
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,690
Renegade, my son;
dinner is ready. Come & have it!

549
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,355
Whatever mothers call us,
it feels good to hear that.

550
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:46,134
What is that betrayal
I did to the community?

551
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,897
I didn't say anything
to the journalists,

552
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:51,156
because I didn't want to
create a fuss by revealing it.

553
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,992
But since I'm a renegade
now, I can say it.

554
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,255
Should a milk-man who tried to
keep a blade on the cow's breast,

555
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,027
He should be slapped!

556
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:02,378
He should be slapped on his face!

557
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:05,263
The 50 acre land that the
government obtained 10 years back,

558
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,163
to be distributed among
1000 homeless people;

559
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,920
when the district secretary Ambadi
Mohanan tried to hand it over to

560
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:15,977
an expatriate
businessman for peanuts;

561
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:17,413
<i>I</i> OPPOSED him!

562
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:22,094
Or renegadism!

563
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:27,145
Comrade Raghavan has said that
if someone does something nasty,

564
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:30,229
Martyr Raghavan.

565
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,389
A strong one, right on
Ambadi Mohanan's face!

566
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:54,307
Gather maximum number of comrades.

567
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,895
The procession should
start from here.

568
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,183
You go to sleep. I'll come.

569
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,889
At the CDP Ayikkara
area committee office,

570
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:18,438
Control calling.

571
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:20,379
There's information that,

572
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:25,157
There will be party workers
in front of my house, right?

573
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:26,982
Of course! There will be some.

574
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,948
Without Bhanu Sir's permission,
we won't get many people.

575
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,359
The police is behind us, right?

576
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:42,598
We should have gone
there in the morning.

577
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:44,327
No. There's nothing to worry.

578
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:45,631
The police is with us.

579
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,990
Hail Ramanunni!

580
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,328
O' brave & valiant Ramanunni!

581
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:03,678
Lead us with valour!

582
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,772
Move! Move! Please come, sir.

583
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:15,508
Wait.

584
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,849
It's a CDP area committee
member's house, right?

585
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:21,974
Protection is needed only outside.

586
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:25,431
Sorry.

587
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,061
None of you have to step inside!

588
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:35,541
Come inside!

589
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:42,281
Go.

590
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,102
Bye. I'll see you at the
guest house in the morning.

591
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,308
No. We'll go to the guest
house together tomorrow. Come!

592
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:48,975
Not just tonight.

593
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:53,096
Let me have dinner.

594
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:11,377
Namaste.

595
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:12,545
Why is he here?

596
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,312
Secretary & Youth Wing
can all stay outside.

597
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:23,849
Thank you very much.
- TC!

598
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,049
You wait outside. You can
leave when I tell you to.

599
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:31,864
Looks like he'll send
me off only after dinner.

600
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:33,859
Comrade!
- Leave me!

601
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:38,317
Dinner is on the table.

602
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,398
I knew that you would
see my speech on TV,

603
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:50,157
and that you would cook
stir-fried lentils for me.

604
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:54,601
You've learned their cheesy
flattering lines so fast!

605
00:47:58,475 --> 00:47:59,555
But no one else
should talk cheesily.

606
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:02,704
As if, right from the time you stopped
breast-feeding & I started talking;

607
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:04,923
I used to talk about Das
Capital & Communist Manifesto!

608
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,267
I don't have the brains for that.

609
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:12,854
Mom, have you read
all of them, Comrade?

610
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,193
And they were
explained in detail too;

611
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,269
A few days before
I gave birth to you.

612
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:23,208
He was saying that his son
should start from the womb itself!

613
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:27,265
And the Comrade's son has grown
up to be dressed in pristine white!

614
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,384
When we are kids,
we play with shit.

615
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,037
The day you will change
this statement of yours.

616
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:10,456
But I will say to you;

617
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,844
And look at this now!

618
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:45,019
Long Live The Revolution!

619
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:51,495
Hail CDP!

620
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,480
Down Down Ramanunni!

621
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:10,212
Close the gate! Fast!

622
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,184
Ramanunni, you traitor!

623
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,139
We'll deal with you later!

624
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,789
CDP workers. I think
there are too many of them.

625
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,408
What do we do with
such few policemen?

626
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,916
Hail CDP!

627
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:30,968
The spears of Vayalar, the
bows & arrows of Wayanad,

628
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:34,252
haven't lost their sharpness yet!
- Down Down Ramanunni!

629
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,064
Hail CDP!

630
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:48,053
There's a torch in
the cupboard. Bring it.

631
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,197
Why does she need a torch
when there are so many lights?

632
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:56,126
Ramanunni, shall we ask
Bhanu sir to send more people?

633
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:58,487
Isn't that better?

634
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:00,399
She closed it. Oh gosh!

635
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:03,845
Open the door, I say! Mom!

636
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:07,366
She locked it.

637
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,465
Hail CDP!

638
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:13,664
Long Live The Revolution!

639
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:16,357
Hail CDP!

640
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:24,829
Down Down Ramanunni!

641
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:30,012
They opened the gate!

642
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:47,953
Your mom betrayed us!

643
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:09,909
Comrades,

644
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,274
Communist Democratic Party,

645
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:17,736
is going to contest a very important
and historic by-election at Ayikkara.

646
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,832
In this election, we have
to fight against a renegade,

647
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,145
who has turned into an instrument
of the bourgeois fascist politicians.

648
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:33,824
Today, the ceremony of announcing
the candidate in Ayikkara,

649
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,127
nominated unanimously by the
entire CDP State Committee;

650
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:42,923
to do it in front of the brave
martyr Comrade Raghavan's house.

651
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,044
I am going to
announce the candidate.

652
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:50,421
Martyr Comrade Raghavan's widow;

653
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:52,404
Comrade Ragini Raghavan.

654
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,789
Hail Comrade Ragini!

655
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,979
Hail Comrade Ragini! Hail CDP!

656
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,011
Our candidate,

657
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:21,840
will talk to you now.

658
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:25,184
My dear comrades,

659
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:29,062
I am committed to fulfil any
duty that the party assigns to me.

660
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:33,607
I know that the decisions taken by
the party would always be correct.

661
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,331
Red Salute!

662
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:43,962
Hail Comrade Ragini!

663
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:48,298
Long Live The Revolution!

664
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:54,795
Hail Comrade Mohanan!

665
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,009
Hail CDP!

666
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:42,326
A leader who has risen,
Our own dear leader,

667
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:45,913
This world which can even change
the golden words of its people.

668
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:47,913
A progress with writings on walls;

669
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:49,524
A battle between parties,

670
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,330
Quarrels on the streets,

671
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:56,143
Everyone would come, folding their
hands, with smiles as their trump cards;

672
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:59,236
Be it the left, or the
right; They are all the same!

673
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:02,766
Queueing up, the people stand
united to give their verdict;

674
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:06,076
When the votes are counted, the
winner would be the king of the people.

675
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,204
A leader who has risen,
Our own dear leader,

676
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:12,974
Light some incense
and pray ringing bells.

677
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,801
A progress with writings on walls;

678
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,389
A battle between parties,

679
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:19,177
Quarrels on the streets,

680
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:21,039
Running around for votes.

681
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:38,155
Even though the flags and
the paths are different;

682
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:41,705
the goal is the same!
Ruling the people!

683
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,822
An array of promises,

684
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,434
A series of endless curses,

685
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,395
It's time to hunt for votes, daily.

686
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:51,832
The constituency has awakened,

687
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:55,125
The competition has
turned into a festival.

688
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,842
The votes cast by the fingers
upon which the ink is applied,

689
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,263
Understand that, work towards that.

690
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,194
No more laziness! Listen
to the people's opinion!

691
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,900
Keep marching forward
to a massive victory!

692
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,083
Everyone would come, folding their
hands, with smiles as their trump cards;

693
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:12,689
Be it the left, or the
right; They are all the same!

694
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,366
When the votes are counted, the
winner would be the king of the people.

695
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:30,302
For you, Comrade.

696
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:51,641
A leader who has risen,
Our own dear leader,

697
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:55,165
This world which can even change
the golden words of its people.

698
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,146
Thanks. I'm really hungry.

699
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:05,158
Everyone would come, folding their
hands, with smiles as their trump cards;

700
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:08,755
Be it the left, or the
right; They are all the same!

701
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,662
Queueing up, the people stand
united to give their verdict;

702
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:13,919
Stop there, you!

703
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:19,099
Everyone would come, folding their
hands, with smiles as their trump cards;

704
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:22,796
Be it the left, or the
right; They are all the same!

705
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:26,179
Queueing up, the people stand
united to give their verdict;

706
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:30,216
When the votes are counted, the
winner would be the king of the people.

707
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,400
What do you think?

708
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:43,191
Why so? Why don't
you have confidence?

709
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:45,486
His mother is his opponent,
right? It might be because of that.

710
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:49,952
I will win, sir.

711
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:51,016
Then what's the problem?

712
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:06,045
I meant that you would sell all the
votes of NSP to the opposite party.

713
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:08,796
Ramanunni!
- How dare you talk nonsense to me?

714
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,129
Ramanunni, talk respectfully!

715
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,850
Do you believe that
I will win, sir?

716
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:17,209
Yes.

717
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:20,846
You may leave.

718
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:24,449
Here, sir. Bye.

719
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:28,216
If you lose, what about
your political future?

720
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:31,836
Why? Won't you try?
- Should you remind me about that?

721
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:34,265
Less talk and more action.
That's what we need.

722
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:38,159
Aren't you coming to
watch the football match?

723
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:39,968
Ya right! Tomorrow is
the election convention.

724
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,734
In between all that, is this
football match needed? Come!

725
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:46,998
Today is the final match, man!

726
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,774
I have played earlier
for Eranadu Stallions.

727
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,257
You freshen up & wait.
I'll come & pick you up.

728
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,047
Okay.

729
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,903
My dear football lovers,

730
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:01,157
within a few minutes, an amazing
battle between the kings of football;

731
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:05,544
is going to ensue
at Chembara ground.

732
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:09,592
The teams that are fighting it
out in today's final match are

733
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:12,869
Eranadu Stallions and
Malappuram Delta Force.

734
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:14,943
The players are
being introduced to,

735
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:18,971
prolific businessman and the caretaker
of Palakkad Football League, Mr.Tomichan.

736
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:23,955
Listen to me.

737
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:28,109
Those are our seats.
Check the list!

738
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,228
We have limitations
on what we can do.

739
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:32,144
What? What's the problem?

740
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,894
We have also paid
money to come here.

741
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,049
Policemen? Where?
Give me that chart.

742
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,728
My dear Chandretta, there's
no point in checking that.

743
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,989
And I reserved it for Ramanunni
& the policemen accompanying him.

744
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,285
If we don't give them seats,
it will be contempt of court.

745
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:49,975
This guy is such a nuisance!

746
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:51,660
You don't worry.

747
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:53,515
Get two additional seats
and make them sit there.

748
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:56,017
That's what I was trying to
do. But they started shouting.

749
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:02,833
Turning this ground into
a sea of football lovers,

750
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,413
including women and children,

751
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,518
and all the people of
this town, age no bar;

752
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:11,276
Brother,

753
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,031
there's a request from our club.

754
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:14,516
It's a small request.
- What?

755
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:16,764
For the first few minutes,
just around 10 minutes;

756
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:19,548
I'm not at all prepared.
- That's okay.

757
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:22,461
It's for our club.
- I'll mess it up.

758
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:26,801
It won't be nice.
- Brother!

759
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,290
Come, brother. Just 10 minutes.

760
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,030
Will you be able to?

761
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:33,985
Do it fast. Make
sure you get votes.

762
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:43,806
The commentary for the first
few minutes of this final match,

763
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:47,244
will be done by Eranad
Stallions team's ex-Captain,

764
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:50,251
and Kerala team's
ex-centre forward,

765
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:51,920
our ex-M LA,

766
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:53,298
Ramanunni Sir!

767
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:55,647
Brother, please start. Rock it!

768
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,207
He should have
stayed there quietly.

769
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,350
They are not booing.

770
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,832
They are cheering for you.

771
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:12,484
I used to be.     www.TamilMV.re

772
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:15,303
It's like that when you get older..

773
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:24,655
The exciting game is beginning now.

774
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,101
It's the fierce battle by
Eranad's mighty warriors

775
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:29,703
who had henna on their
blood-smeared hands.

776
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:31,969
With shots like thunderbolts,

777
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:34,596
Stallions Mancheri's Noushad,

778
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,329
Throwing the audience into
a frenzy of excitement,

779
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,241
we are witnessing a fierce
battle between both the teams.

780
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,401
So instead of doing
commentary for this game,

781
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:48,759
because of my desire to watch
the game from the gallery,

782
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:50,282
lam going to the gallery.

783
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,640
Requesting every single
one of you to vote for me,

784
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:56,017
I am leaving. Thank you. Namaste!

785
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:01,352
When he used to be in the Kerala
team, I have seen one match.

786
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:03,261
He's an expert in fouls.

787
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,813
He got a red card on that day.

788
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:08,348
(Commentary in progress)

789
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:36,946
As the Eranad Stallions are marching
to victory in the first half,

790
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:40,383
here's the whistle
calling for half-time.

791
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:45,188
The Eranad Stallions are receiving
wide applause from the audience.

792
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:47,158
They will rock in the second half.

793
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:50,623
To watch our final match,

794
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,800
CDP candidate, Comrade
Ragini Raghavan is here now.

795
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:56,933
We welcome her
respectfully to the gallery.

796
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,766
We also should have come in
creating a frenzy like this.

797
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:03,408
Sheesh! Why didn't
I think of this idea?

798
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,831
Didn't you hear the booing
when I did the commentary?

799
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:09,868
Ya! I heard it!

800
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:15,779
Hail Comrade Ragini!

801
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:17,175
Comrade!

802
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:37,552
Someone call a doctor!

803
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:38,964
Move away!

804
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:44,086
Comrade!

805
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:47,866
Mohanetta, what happened?

806
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:51,079
Call an ambulance.

807
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,426
Isn't there any doctor from
the sports council here?

808
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,560
Mohanetta!
- Excuse me.

809
01:03:59,101 --> 01:03:59,921
Doctor.

810
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:34,970
Someone shot him!

811
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:39,491
Oh God!

812
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:41,039
It's not safe to stay here now.

813
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,397
Let's go! Come on!

814
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:45,547
Come! Let's go!

815
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:50,315
Move! Move away!

816
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,230
Move, I say!

817
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:56,021
He is dead.

818
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:57,429
No one should touch the body!

819
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,550
Cover the scene.

820
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:00,404
Report to the SP & ask
him to send more forces.

821
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,041
Come fast!

822
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,140
Move! Come this way!

823
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:17,996
Go directly to my home.

824
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:21,292
It's not safe to stay at
home. I have to get my clothes.

825
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:22,851
Start the car!
- Start!

826
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:28,322
Whatever provocation
happens from their side;

827
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,255
they may even burn our office down;

828
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,423
there might be attacks
against our workers;

829
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:36,414
Ramanunni!

830
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:41,325
We can proceed after hearing the
election commission's decision.

831
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:42,607
And be careful!

832
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:54,499
I am sure!

833
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:00,212
Huh? What?

834
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,669
A week back, he pointed
a gun at me and told me;

835
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:04,232
that he will point
it at Mohanan too,

836
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:08,930
Get his statement. Right now!

837
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,460
Call the PC on protection and
find out where Ramanunni is.

838
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,216
Arrange the sufficient force
for his protection. Right now!

839
01:06:18,607 --> 01:06:20,247
Your people should make sure that
the crowd doesn't enter this space.

840
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:23,009
Until the force arrives. Or else,
we'll lose the little evidence we have.

841
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:30,691
The entire footage from the
channels that covered the game;

842
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:32,817
should be handed over to
the police today itself.

843
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:34,339
Deepak,

844
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:37,585
From the reservation chart,

845
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:40,077
make the people from this gallery
alone, without missing anyone;

846
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,019
What about the election?

847
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:50,230
If there's a law & order issue,
the election will be postponed.

848
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,440
Where is Bhanu?
- Can't get through to him, sir.

849
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,137
Ayikkara will burn!

850
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,861
Additional force is for
your protection, sir.

851
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:14,735
Call some more people if you can.

852
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:26,378
Breaking News.

853
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:29,709
Ambadi Mohanan was murdered. Murder
happened in front of thousands.

854
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:35,538
The police suspect that the shot was
fired from a silencer-attached gun.

855
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,438
Ramanunni's presence at the 1st
class gallery during the incident,

856
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:45,144
After the proceedings, the police will take
the corpse to Kozhikode Medical College.

857
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:47,765
Doctors lead by the Police surgeon,

858
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,114
in the presence of forensic
& ballistic experts,

859
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:53,023
will perform the post mortem
tonight itself, apparently.

860
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:58,022
He is sharing his
condolences with the workers.

861
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,870
This is purely a
pre-planned murder.

862
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:08,053
Our party will fight against
it legally and politically!

863
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:12,828
I have given strict instructions
to the lower factions,

864
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:18,067
that there shouldn't be any emotional
reactions from any party workers.

865
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:25,751
The party has decided to call for a
completely peaceful Harthal (strike).

866
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:30,345
Ballistic experts have arrived.

867
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:34,825
From the primary deductions,

868
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,161
it cannot be seen as
a political murder.

869
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:39,016
In front of so many people,

870
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:44,098
Sir, is the murderer related
to any terrorist group?

871
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:47,647
We cannot confirm baseless
facts based on speculations.

872
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:52,926
The Home Minister & Party Secretary
have promised the Election Commission

873
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:54,879
that there won't be
any law & order issues.

874
01:08:55,364 --> 01:08:57,354
They needn't waste the sympathy
wave that they got, right?

875
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:05,132
If the election had been postponed,

876
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:07,171
all the work we did would
have gone down the drain.

877
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,313
But who would have
murdered Mohanan?

878
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:11,339
Even though it was
Mohanan who was killed,

879
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:14,135
I am the target, TC.

880
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,009
Sit.

881
01:09:26,428 --> 01:09:27,798
Right now, only a
couple of questions.

882
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:29,100
We'll talk in detail later.

883
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,039
He denied that in front
of the media that day.

884
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:38,184
That you pointed a gun
at Comrade Rajendran...

885
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:51,841
I will point this to Mohanan as well
and that will be to shoot him down;

886
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:53,454
A sentence like that..
Did you say that?

887
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:57,341
The situation then..
- It's true. You said it.

888
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:01,121
Inside the guest room of
Reporter channel, with Mohanan..

889
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:04,697
Sir, he kicked me out without
any provocation. Everyone saw it!

890
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:08,853
No one saw what
happened inside, right?

891
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:12,914
After you got the gun,

892
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:20,098
Yes sir.

893
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:24,579
Do you both have Aadhar cards?

894
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:27,439
Come.

895
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:35,279
Note these details
and SMS it to me.

896
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,920
Thomas, SMS the details of
these cards to sir. Make it fast.

897
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:42,510
Can I see your gun, Ramanunni?

898
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:46,067
It is at home, sir.

899
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,060
You went home directly
from the stadium, right?

900
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:53,965
Sir,

901
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:56,946
it's like you have already decided
that I should be the culprit.

902
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:13,975
Is he an agricultural
officer or what?

903
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:19,839
Our palm prints, blood groups, retina
scans & even our DNAs are in that, right?

904
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:23,528
But I...

905
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,166
You are my constant
companion, right?

906
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:34,225
Don't be shocked.

907
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:35,473
What?

908
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:37,969
The policemen standing outside?

909
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:39,544
Yes.

910
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:43,014
Then?

911
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:49,120
Police custody!

912
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:50,421
Don't give me such bullshit!

913
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:52,877
Then you go and try.

914
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:54,092
Try, man!

915
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:02,953
Did you send the message to sir?
- Yes sir.

916
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:05,183
Idly is fine, right?

917
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:08,907
What?

918
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:11,866
No! It's not that.

919
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:14,437
I was talking about bringing breakfast
when I come back in the morning.

920
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,994
Breakfast is in the morning, right?

921
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:18,956
Now you go and sit inside, sir.

922
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:22,527
I don't want to take rest.

923
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,146
Let me talk"
- Sit inside..

924
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:26,257
<i>Son-an Sh'!</i>

925
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,030
That's it!

926
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:33,231
All of them will learn a lesson!

927
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,859
Just because some scoundrel
killed some other scoundrel,

928
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:44,108
To put us in trouble..

929
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:52,312
Service temporarily
suspended, it seems.

930
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:55,520
Mine too.

931
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:14,609
The Sub Divisional Magistrate,

932
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:16,800
and some school teacher nearby,

933
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:18,086
and a photographer.

934
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:20,197
Take them & go to
Ramanunni's house immediately.

935
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:21,546
Come on, quick!

936
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,219
Before Ambadi Mohanan's funeral,

937
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:54,081
the culprit will be
arrested. That's all!

938
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:55,513
Make way, please.

939
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:01,549
That is the path of the bullet;

940
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,201
it is 35 degrees
downward from the front.

941
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,994
And it has been shot from
a 22-23 metre distance.

942
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:09,894
That means,

943
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:13,105
from the first or second
row on top of the gallery.

944
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:17,485
Ramanunni & Thomas Chacko were on
these two seats in the second row.

945
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:21,872
The bullet recovered from the body.

946
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:26,427
This is a .32 bullet.

947
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,747
All the licensed
guns in the district

948
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:35,986
have been surrendered
before the ADM.

949
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,549
Except Ramanunni's gun.

950
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:42,322
Ramanunni's revolver
seized from his house.

951
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:52,769
Sir, in this situation, will
the election be postponed?

952
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:55,675
The culprits will be arrested
in half an hour. You can witness!

953
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:56,974
Move, please.

954
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,119
Webley & Scott .32 Revolver.

955
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:01,221
.32 Revolver.

956
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:04,281
This is a 6-shot revolver.

957
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:09,236
There were only 5 bullets in this.

958
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:11,489
One bullet is missing.

959
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,748
This is not just
a political murder.

960
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:27,137
Personal vengeance is the reason.

961
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:30,166
We have 3 solid prior
incidents to prove that.

962
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:32,772
Corroborated by 12 statements.

963
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:37,481
And, on this gun;

964
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:42,019
Ramanunni's and Thomas Chacko's.

965
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:49,279
Who among them was the
one who shot the gun?

966
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:51,382
That' the only remaining
thing to be proved.

967
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,843
Did you give them breakfast?
- Yes sir.

968
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:57,565
Shall I proceed to arrest them?

969
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:00,375
Yes. You can proceed.

970
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,084
What?

971
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:14,438
Come on, search!

972
01:17:07,525 --> 01:17:08,375
Comrades,

973
01:17:10,261 --> 01:17:13,101
we have always answered
back for every martyrdom.

974
01:17:13,631 --> 01:17:15,381
That's not a policy of ours.
It's an emotion.

975
01:17:17,035 --> 01:17:18,495
That emotional community sense,

976
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:20,190
is this party's foundation.

977
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:27,870
Long Live the Revolution!

978
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:36,190
Ramanunni & Thomas Chacko were on
these two seats of the second row.

979
01:17:36,788 --> 01:17:38,308
This is a .32 bullet.

980
01:17:38,656 --> 01:17:40,496
Ever since the by-election
notification was out,

981
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:45,199
all the licensed guns in the district
have been surrendered before the ADM.

982
01:17:46,097 --> 01:17:47,117
Except Ramanunni's gun.

983
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,880
Personal vengeance is the reason.

984
01:17:51,169 --> 01:17:53,419
Three solid prior incidents,

985
01:17:53,805 --> 01:17:56,385
and statements from 12 witnesses
which corroborate that;

986
01:17:57,075 --> 01:17:59,265
We have sufficient and
conclusive evidence.

987
01:18:00,078 --> 01:18:00,928
And not just that,

988
01:18:01,212 --> 01:18:02,962
this gun has palm-prints
of two people.

989
01:18:03,381 --> 01:18:05,021
Ramanunni's & Thomas Chacko's.

990
01:18:13,357 --> 01:18:17,427
This is a soft drink can that was found
from the first class gallery by the police.

991
01:18:21,399 --> 01:18:22,569
I mean, silencer.

992
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,040
A silencer which can be made easily
by anyone, using a soft drink can.

993
01:18:27,038 --> 01:18:30,258
Many sites on the internet show how
it is made, along with pictures.

994
01:18:31,142 --> 01:18:33,802
Have you found Ramanunni's & Thomas
Chacko's fingerprints on that, sir?

995
01:18:34,278 --> 01:18:37,268
The crowd that had assembled at the
first class gallery after the incident,

996
01:18:38,015 --> 01:18:40,295
This was found in a condition that
was trampled and crushed by them.

997
01:18:41,686 --> 01:18:44,376
The accused escaped from
police custody very expertly.

998
01:18:45,056 --> 01:18:47,666
But his face which is popular
among all the people of Kerala;

999
01:18:50,261 --> 01:18:51,521
And so, arrest will happen soon.

1000
01:19:01,205 --> 01:19:02,315
One bullet.

1001
01:19:03,975 --> 01:19:05,235
How did it go missing
from the gun?

1002
01:19:12,416 --> 01:19:13,266
No!

1003
01:19:13,551 --> 01:19:15,221
If so, I should suspect
you first, right?

1004
01:19:18,289 --> 01:19:19,929
Oh! Is that so?

1005
01:19:20,992 --> 01:19:21,662
Okay!

1006
01:19:27,665 --> 01:19:28,515
Where are you going?

1007
01:19:28,666 --> 01:19:30,396
Let the police arrest me.
Let them question me.

1008
01:19:30,701 --> 01:19:33,251
How did my fingerprint come on the gun?
That's what they need to know, right?

1009
01:19:33,704 --> 01:19:35,164
The answer for that is
what you just said.

1010
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:38,310
Even the Comrades have seen you
giving me the gun many times!

1011
01:19:40,578 --> 01:19:41,428
Move!

1012
01:19:41,612 --> 01:19:42,432
If I don't leave now,

1013
01:19:44,348 --> 01:19:46,078
Move, Ramanunni.
- Go and sit there!

1014
01:19:47,285 --> 01:19:49,215
Only because I don't have the
address of a father or a family;

1015
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:51,840
I have been doing a servant's job
to all the people in the party,

1016
01:19:52,256 --> 01:19:54,096
and even you, who came in now.

1017
01:19:54,692 --> 01:19:57,032
But that was because I was sure
that my day would come too.

1018
01:19:57,495 --> 01:19:59,665
That shouldn't end for someone
else within a matter of a day.

1019
01:20:05,303 --> 01:20:06,503
You are not going anywhere!

1020
01:20:09,207 --> 01:20:10,197
This is a trap laid for me.

1021
01:20:10,408 --> 01:20:11,838
Whether it is from the
Left or the Right.

1022
01:20:17,014 --> 01:20:19,354
Have the police decided who the accused
are with such conclusive evidence,

1023
01:20:20,017 --> 01:20:21,007
till date in Kerala?

1024
01:20:24,055 --> 01:20:25,545
They will make you say
whatever they need.

1025
01:20:26,591 --> 01:20:27,581
You will be an Approver.

1026
01:20:30,294 --> 01:20:32,374
Didn't you talk about it now?
Your political future!

1027
01:20:36,734 --> 01:20:38,514
I can come out on
parole after 2-3 years.

1028
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:41,350
If I come out, then cut & paste!

1029
01:20:45,643 --> 01:20:48,013
It's not that I want to live
long and create history here.

1030
01:20:49,714 --> 01:20:50,854
Like my father,

1031
01:21:00,157 --> 01:21:01,327
I will chop you into pieces!

1032
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:14,880
Until the polling is over,
CDP won't make a move.

1033
01:21:15,473 --> 01:21:17,053
It's an easy walk-over for them, right?

1034
01:21:18,376 --> 01:21:20,456
NSP's independent candidate,
the murderer is absconding.

1035
01:21:23,648 --> 01:21:25,818
They will be on a hunt in
every NSP member's house.

1036
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:27,370
I'm telling you again!

1037
01:21:27,585 --> 01:21:30,275
Ramanunni is just an independent
candidate supported by NSP.

1038
01:21:35,426 --> 01:21:38,036
So to save your lives and honour,
this is the only option now.

1039
01:21:47,071 --> 01:21:49,911
The support that NSP had extended
to independent candidate Ramanunni,

1040
01:21:50,408 --> 01:21:52,398
has been cancelled
unconditionally;

1041
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:57,530
and I'm glad to inform that NSP's complete
support will be with him - Sumesh.

1042
01:21:59,383 --> 01:22:00,873
Hello! Ya.
Just a minute.

1043
01:22:03,354 --> 01:22:04,434
I am coming with them.

1044
01:22:05,456 --> 01:22:06,446
I'll start in the evening.

1045
01:22:09,293 --> 01:22:10,963
All the cameras should
be perfectly concealed.

1046
01:22:11,529 --> 01:22:13,019
They shouldn't spot
even one of them.

1047
01:22:13,464 --> 01:22:15,014
And once you install the mobile jammer,

1048
01:22:15,299 --> 01:22:16,999
go to every nook and
corner and check it.

1049
01:22:20,371 --> 01:22:22,391
And ya, remove the dish
antenna and TVs immediately.

1050
01:22:23,574 --> 01:22:24,864
We are going to rock, dear!

1051
01:22:31,282 --> 01:22:33,652
When they make something,
can't they make it sweet?

1052
01:22:46,497 --> 01:22:47,927
Chandrika?

1053
01:22:50,534 --> 01:22:51,904
I have a blouse
tailor-made for you.

1054
01:22:52,636 --> 01:22:54,476
Then stick a dry grape
on your face as well.

1055
01:22:56,173 --> 01:22:57,433
Then no one would recognize you.

1056
01:22:59,944 --> 01:23:01,694
Let's try and get away from
here somehow, you devil!

1057
01:23:04,115 --> 01:23:05,515
Do something weird to
your face and hair.

1058
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,540
Should I also look weird now?

1059
01:23:10,688 --> 01:23:11,918
Or else, I'll go surrender.

1060
01:23:13,457 --> 01:23:14,537
I'm not going. Let
me have my drink.

1061
01:23:19,196 --> 01:23:20,506
I have mailed your
note to the advocate.

1062
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,060
Let's move it tomorrow itself.

1063
01:23:24,335 --> 01:23:25,795
It's sure that sessions
would deny it.

1064
01:23:26,103 --> 01:23:27,123
Second chance is
at the High Court.

1065
01:23:29,607 --> 01:23:31,827
Are you going to hide thinking
that you'll get anticipatory bail?

1066
01:23:36,547 --> 01:23:38,857
If I cannot escape from this, why
should I call myself a lawyer then?

1067
01:23:40,484 --> 01:23:41,884
Hey! Chandrika is here!

1068
01:23:45,289 --> 01:23:46,489
Have you brought any munchies?

1069
01:23:52,530 --> 01:23:54,430
Now we will contact each other
only through these mobiles.

1070
01:23:56,133 --> 01:23:57,393
And I have saved my
new number as well.

1071
01:24:02,506 --> 01:24:04,116
Jeans, T-shirts, shorts?

1072
01:24:04,508 --> 01:24:06,818
Hey! I won't wear any of this!

1073
01:24:07,311 --> 01:24:09,861
If someone sees me wearing this, my
political future would end there!

1074
01:24:10,347 --> 01:24:12,337
Hey! It's better that I
surrender than doing this!

1075
01:24:15,519 --> 01:24:17,299
Until then, it's dangerous
to travel in my car.

1076
01:24:17,688 --> 01:24:19,468
I have found a way
to cross Mangalore.

1077
01:24:22,226 --> 01:24:24,366
Kozhikode - Thalassery - Kannur
- Kasargode - Mangalore.

1078
01:24:24,995 --> 01:24:26,835
That route is there, right?
You think you are Columbus?

1079
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:30,410
Don't you know this place?

1080
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:35,000
You are really drunk, man!

1081
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:37,870
It's at Goa - Maharashtra border.

1082
01:24:39,477 --> 01:24:41,227
I haven't taken my passport.
- Shut up!

1083
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,090
There's buttermilk in the fridge.
Give some to him.

1084
01:24:44,982 --> 01:24:46,972
Buttermilk is great with Vodka.
Bring it!

1085
01:24:48,352 --> 01:24:50,932
A beach resort where my friend
is doing the interior work,

1086
01:24:51,388 --> 01:24:52,848
at Goa - Maharashtra border.

1087
01:24:54,492 --> 01:24:55,482
Won't there be workers there then?

1088
01:25:00,631 --> 01:25:02,031
Goans drink very well!

1089
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:04,673
And ya, there are absolutely no
communication facilities there.

1090
01:25:05,169 --> 01:25:06,749
No land phone, no signal for mobiles;

1091
01:25:08,405 --> 01:25:10,155
There's a town 28 kms away.

1092
01:25:11,976 --> 01:25:13,146
I can't survive without that.

1093
01:25:15,246 --> 01:25:16,096
Well,

1094
01:25:17,715 --> 01:25:18,915
What are you going to
do by knowing them?

1095
01:25:19,183 --> 01:25:20,033
Shut up, man!

1096
01:25:20,651 --> 01:25:21,551
I'll be there for that, right?

1097
01:25:21,986 --> 01:25:23,506
I can go out, find things
out and come back, right?

1098
01:25:24,054 --> 01:25:24,904
Hey!

1099
01:25:27,391 --> 01:25:28,941
We don't have to cut
our hair, wear shorts,

1100
01:25:30,728 --> 01:25:32,838
we just have to go out on the
road and they will take us there.

1101
01:25:36,167 --> 01:25:37,397
I don't think we
can go with him.

1102
01:25:38,002 --> 01:25:39,732
No. Even if he goes out
on the road, it's fine.

1103
01:25:40,037 --> 01:25:41,497
But when they take us, they
will take us together.

1104
01:25:43,107 --> 01:25:43,957
Right?

1105
01:25:49,046 --> 01:25:50,036
I am not that type!

1106
01:25:51,649 --> 01:25:52,499
Leave me!

1107
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:56,970
Shut up!

1108
01:26:06,463 --> 01:26:08,633
'A burning fire in the heart'

1109
01:26:08,999 --> 01:26:14,799
'Still where are you going, far away,
with a smile on your face?'

1110
01:26:15,706 --> 01:26:19,926
'A raging fire of betrayal
is spreading all over'

1111
01:26:20,611 --> 01:26:25,411
'Through that, where
are you going, far away?'

1112
01:26:37,528 --> 01:26:40,018
'Like how Sreeraman
went away long ago'

1113
01:26:40,464 --> 01:26:41,834
<i>'Wow'</i>

1114
01:26:42,299 --> 01:26:44,789
'From the land to the
forest, this game of Rama'

1115
01:26:45,236 --> 01:26:46,496
<i>'Wow'</i>

1116
01:26:46,971 --> 01:26:49,141
'Running without an end,
this game of Rama'

1117
01:26:51,542 --> 01:26:53,882
'Searching for secrecy,
this game of Rama'

1118
01:26:54,378 --> 01:26:56,278
'Whose sins are you
suffering for, Rama?'

1119
01:26:56,647 --> 01:26:58,757
'This game is spreading
around like wildfire'

1120
01:26:59,149 --> 01:27:00,929
'Hide in the forests and wait, Rama'

1121
01:27:01,318 --> 01:27:03,658
'Your game of
conquest is truthful'

1122
01:27:05,723 --> 01:27:08,213
'Like how Sreeraman
went away long ago'

1123
01:27:08,692 --> 01:27:09,592
<i>'Wow'</i>

1124
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:12,750
'From the land to the
forest, this game of Rama'

1125
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:15,100
'A burning fire in the heart'

1126
01:27:15,466 --> 01:27:19,946
'Still where are you going, far away,
with a smile on your face?'

1127
01:27:22,039 --> 01:27:24,089
There's just one problem.
There are too many pillars.

1128
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,860
Once I enter my room, I want to
walk openly, without clothes.

1129
01:27:33,751 --> 01:27:35,271
There's a limit to
driving a person crazy!

1130
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:38,040
I'm playing this game
with my life at stake.

1131
01:27:42,593 --> 01:27:46,193
I'm asking you just to be with me, in
your senses, to get out of this mess.

1132
01:27:48,032 --> 01:27:48,672
Don't betray me.

1133
01:27:51,201 --> 01:27:52,511
'Someone is standing
guard all around'

1134
01:27:55,205 --> 01:27:57,815
'Cut it off and
come out, Oh Rama'

1135
01:27:58,275 --> 01:27:59,125
TC!

1136
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:01,990
'Stay away for some time'

1137
01:28:02,479 --> 01:28:03,819
'Hide in the pit and wait'

1138
01:28:04,214 --> 01:28:05,064
TC!

1139
01:28:05,215 --> 01:28:07,145
(Saying gibberish)

1140
01:28:14,091 --> 01:28:15,931
I want to make a confession!

1141
01:28:21,332 --> 01:28:23,472
'Like how Sreeraman
went away long ago'

1142
01:28:24,101 --> 01:28:25,001
<i>'Wow'</i>

1143
01:28:28,439 --> 01:28:29,989
'A burning fire in the heart'

1144
01:28:34,745 --> 01:28:36,055
What?
- Ramanunni's face.

1145
01:28:37,481 --> 01:28:40,941
'A raging fire of betrayal
is spreading all over'

1146
01:28:41,518 --> 01:28:43,508
'Through that, where
are you going, far away?'

1147
01:28:44,221 --> 01:28:45,331
What is going on there?

1148
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:14,654
Ajay,

1149
01:29:15,052 --> 01:29:16,832
the jammers are working perfectly, right?
- Yes, dear.

1150
01:29:17,187 --> 01:29:18,267
There are no problems with that.

1151
01:29:49,319 --> 01:29:50,369
Thank God!

1152
01:29:53,724 --> 01:29:55,744
If Thomas escapes,
it's all over!

1153
01:30:09,373 --> 01:30:12,853
The shot was fired from either the first
or second row from the top of the gallery.

1154
01:30:22,219 --> 01:30:23,949
Ever since the by-election
notification was out,

1155
01:30:24,288 --> 01:30:27,978
all the licensed guns in the district
have been surrendered before the ADM.

1156
01:30:29,526 --> 01:30:30,516
And not just that,

1157
01:30:30,761 --> 01:30:32,841
this gun has palm-prints
of two people.

1158
01:30:33,230 --> 01:30:34,250
Ramanunni's & Thomas Chacko's.

1159
01:30:40,237 --> 01:30:41,817
Hey! Take this away.
Don't do such vulgar stuff.

1160
01:30:43,173 --> 01:30:45,193
This is something worn
to hide the vulgarity.

1161
01:30:47,177 --> 01:30:49,197
I'm wearing this daily by
turning it inside out.

1162
01:30:59,556 --> 01:31:00,406
Is it?

1163
01:31:03,227 --> 01:31:04,077
I do remember.

1164
01:31:06,663 --> 01:31:08,713
Since there's no Church or priest here,

1165
01:31:10,968 --> 01:31:12,018
You will have peace of mind.

1166
01:31:14,671 --> 01:31:15,521
Helena,

1167
01:31:17,207 --> 01:31:18,057
Helena?

1168
01:31:20,711 --> 01:31:21,561
Okay.

1169
01:31:24,648 --> 01:31:25,988
Whatever you have to say!

1170
01:31:29,186 --> 01:31:30,086
But I have something to say.

1171
01:31:33,657 --> 01:31:35,147
I don't think you did
it with your own hand.

1172
01:31:36,293 --> 01:31:37,143
But,

1173
01:31:41,698 --> 01:31:43,718
Or, it happened with your consent.

1174
01:31:46,336 --> 01:31:48,236
Not because of the expulsion
from the party or politics,

1175
01:31:49,172 --> 01:31:50,102
to kill him,

1176
01:32:06,123 --> 01:32:07,793
Pointing the gun at
the guest house,

1177
01:32:08,125 --> 01:32:09,855
and you said that you'll
fire it on Mohanan one day.

1178
01:32:10,227 --> 01:32:11,747
And the incident at the channel studio.

1179
01:32:12,062 --> 01:32:13,732
When I asked you what
happened inside,

1180
01:32:14,031 --> 01:32:15,321
you said you'll tell me
when I have to know!

1181
01:32:17,601 --> 01:32:18,971
I'll listen!
- Then listen!

1182
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:20,420
I'll tell you!

1183
01:32:22,439 --> 01:32:24,079
I have a reason to kill him!

1184
01:32:28,745 --> 01:32:32,875
First, at the party office;
he said it cryptically,

1185
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:39,570
Your father had a bad habit
of having such ideologies.

1186
01:32:42,993 --> 01:32:45,013
Since he was stabbed with
a knife by someone in the dark,

1187
01:32:57,441 --> 01:32:58,551
I wanted to meet you alone.

1188
01:33:04,014 --> 01:33:05,384
I'll do that, after hearing it from you.

1189
01:33:11,254 --> 01:33:12,124
My father's death.

1190
01:33:36,346 --> 01:33:37,196
Yes.

1191
01:33:43,487 --> 01:33:46,267
I reached this stature after playing and
plotting many games of blood-baths.

1192
01:33:49,693 --> 01:33:51,833
My hard-work started when I
ran around in shorts itself!

1193
01:34:12,182 --> 01:34:13,492
Since you heard this much,
I'll tell you the rest too.

1194
01:34:14,017 --> 01:34:15,717
How that was credited
to NSP's account..

1195
01:34:16,186 --> 01:34:18,646
To switch two actual
culprits in another case,

1196
01:34:20,724 --> 01:34:23,124
a favour that Udayabhanu
had to do for me;

1197
01:34:25,395 --> 01:34:27,915
the butcher was also
supplied by Udayabhanu.

1198
01:34:32,202 --> 01:34:33,462
So when are you
going to shoot me?

1199
01:35:04,067 --> 01:35:05,357
I should be the one
killing him, right?

1200
01:35:06,136 --> 01:35:06,986
Tell me!

1201
01:35:15,112 --> 01:35:15,962
Done!

1202
01:35:16,313 --> 01:35:18,653
Tomorrow evening 7.30, during
the prime time of all channels,

1203
01:35:19,082 --> 01:35:20,512
this episode should be
uploaded on the website.

1204
01:35:21,017 --> 01:35:23,597
Send a mail to all channels
with our promo attached to it.

1205
01:35:26,323 --> 01:35:27,553
Entire Kerala should wait.

1206
01:35:29,359 --> 01:35:30,209
What say?

1207
01:35:31,728 --> 01:35:32,578
Hey! Look!

1208
01:35:38,602 --> 01:35:39,452
Drink it, I say!

1209
01:35:48,311 --> 01:35:49,951
Ramanunni, don't hurt me.

1210
01:35:50,614 --> 01:35:51,464
Tell me!

1211
01:35:59,923 --> 01:36:01,183
Tell me!
- Don't hit me!

1212
01:36:02,459 --> 01:36:03,309
I'll tell you.

1213
01:36:06,129 --> 01:36:07,739
Called me and threatened
that he would kill me.

1214
01:36:09,933 --> 01:36:10,603
Episode 2!

1215
01:36:13,203 --> 01:36:15,373
Case No.1, which we are
presenting in this programme,

1216
01:36:16,106 --> 01:36:19,476
'Hiding days of a culprit'

1217
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:21,280
Ambadi Mohanan murder.

1218
01:36:21,578 --> 01:36:23,768
A unique political murder.

1219
01:36:24,247 --> 01:36:27,557
Ever since Ramanunni was declared
a suspect, we were following him.

1220
01:36:28,251 --> 01:36:31,211
Following Ramanunni and his assistant
Thomas Chacko, we reached

1221
01:36:31,688 --> 01:36:33,968
their hideout which is outside Kerala.

1222
01:36:34,457 --> 01:36:37,087
Planting some hidden cameras in this
hideout without their knowledge;

1223
01:36:37,527 --> 01:36:39,137
we are recording the
hiding days of these wolves

1224
01:36:39,496 --> 01:36:41,166
who disguise themselves
as public servants.

1225
01:36:41,464 --> 01:36:43,104
Through their own
words and actions,

1226
01:36:43,433 --> 01:36:46,713
we welcome the public and the police
to gather new truths and evidences,

1227
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:48,410
revealed by them.

1228
01:36:49,206 --> 01:36:50,346
Hiding days of a culprit,

1229
01:36:51,741 --> 01:36:53,001
This was attached to the mail.

1230
01:36:55,212 --> 01:36:57,402
Open the website of 'Hot Pursuit'
and start working with this mail.

1231
01:36:58,048 --> 01:36:58,898
Come on! Fast!

1232
01:37:01,451 --> 01:37:02,471
I am contesting here.

1233
01:37:02,986 --> 01:37:04,476
Our symbol - Auto Rickshaw.
- Namaste.

1234
01:37:06,323 --> 01:37:07,873
We have to fold hands
even in front of enemies.

1235
01:37:10,327 --> 01:37:11,877
Ramanunni is on TV!

1236
01:37:13,496 --> 01:37:14,486
Come, Prakashan.

1237
01:37:15,999 --> 01:37:16,929
Huh?
What is it?

1238
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:18,350
Ramanunni is on TV, it seems!

1239
01:37:18,602 --> 01:37:20,092
Ramanunni on TV?
Everybody, come!

1240
01:37:20,437 --> 01:37:23,367
With evidences that point fingers at the
mystery behind Ambadi Mohanan's murder,

1241
01:37:27,477 --> 01:37:29,877
Ramanunni and Thomas Chacko who
are suspected to be the culprits,

1242
01:37:32,048 --> 01:37:35,618
And the same night, Ambadi
Mohanan killed my father.

1243
01:37:39,389 --> 01:37:41,319
A distinctive political murder.

1244
01:37:41,691 --> 01:37:44,761
Ever since Ramanunni was declared
a suspect, we were following him.

1245
01:37:45,362 --> 01:37:48,112
Following Ramanunni and his assistant
Thomas Chacko, we reached

1246
01:37:48,598 --> 01:37:50,348
their hideout which is outside Kerala.

1247
01:37:50,734 --> 01:37:53,344
Planting some hidden cameras in this
hideout without their knowledge;

1248
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:55,500
we are recording the
hiding days of these wolves

1249
01:37:57,574 --> 01:37:59,324
Through their own
words and actions,

1250
01:37:59,643 --> 01:38:02,633
we welcome the public and the police
to gather new truths and evidences,

1251
01:38:03,146 --> 01:38:04,106
revealed by them.

1252
01:38:11,721 --> 01:38:12,571
Sir!

1253
01:38:14,324 --> 01:38:16,284
Both the site's IP address
and the mail lD's IP address

1254
01:38:16,626 --> 01:38:17,446
are from Singapore.

1255
01:38:17,627 --> 01:38:19,467
What?
- Not that they are in Singapore.

1256
01:38:55,732 --> 01:38:57,692
This is something which is
worn to hide vulgarity.

1257
01:38:58,101 --> 01:38:59,531
You had said that you wanted
to confess yesterday.

1258
01:39:00,036 --> 01:39:00,886
I don't remember that.

1259
01:39:01,104 --> 01:39:03,914
Since there's no Church or priest here,
you just have to confess to anyone.

1260
01:39:21,624 --> 01:39:23,844
Ambadi Mohanan killed my father.

1261
01:39:27,564 --> 01:39:28,464
This is his game!

1262
01:39:28,732 --> 01:39:30,192
Ya right!
Comrade Mohanan, it seems!

1263
01:39:33,136 --> 01:39:34,916
His trick to make us
fight between ourselves.

1264
01:39:36,306 --> 01:39:39,556
A return gift, for Ambadi
Mohanan's co-operation,

1265
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:41,510
in a murder committed by NSP.

1266
01:39:42,545 --> 01:39:46,005
The butcher who killed my father
was supplied by Udayabhanu.

1267
01:39:48,651 --> 01:39:50,171
When I did a help for them,

1268
01:39:53,223 --> 01:39:54,333
Now, what do we tell the public?

1269
01:39:55,592 --> 01:39:57,402
Is it so difficult
to fool the public?

1270
01:40:00,263 --> 01:40:02,783
Well,
$0.. Was it you?

1271
01:40:08,438 --> 01:40:09,988
Extra Judicial Confession.

1272
01:40:14,110 --> 01:40:16,950
This programme is part of a
conspiracy to destroy our party.

1273
01:40:17,514 --> 01:40:19,034
With a pre-planned script,

1274
01:40:21,151 --> 01:40:22,901
this has been shot with
Ramanunni's acknowledgement.

1275
01:40:23,253 --> 01:40:24,543
But sir, politically..
- I don't have anything more to say.

1276
01:40:24,988 --> 01:40:28,058
The party secretary is saying that it was
shot with Ramanunni's acknowledgement.

1277
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:32,250
What he has done now,
is self incriminating.

1278
01:40:36,066 --> 01:40:37,526
Moreover, according to
Indian Evidence Act,

1279
01:40:40,603 --> 01:40:43,593
If you ask me whether it was
Mohanan who got Raghavan killed,

1280
01:40:46,476 --> 01:40:47,846
I had no part to play in it.

1281
01:40:49,446 --> 01:40:51,966
I was cut 37 times
at that bus-stand.

1282
01:40:55,051 --> 01:40:56,421
Who was the first accused in that case?

1283
01:40:58,388 --> 01:41:00,668
How can I strike a deal
with such a person?

1284
01:41:01,091 --> 01:41:03,371
Comrade Raghavan was a leader who
had such a soulful relationship,

1285
01:41:05,728 --> 01:41:06,578
Comrade,      www.TamilMV.re

1286
01:41:06,996 --> 01:41:09,396
this confession will create confusion
among the workers and supporters.

1287
01:41:12,702 --> 01:41:14,162
There are only <i>7</i> days
left for the election.

1288
01:41:16,439 --> 01:41:19,069
Announce a re-investigation
of Comrade Raghavan's murder.

1289
01:41:21,411 --> 01:41:23,961
For the time being, that's enough
to protect the image of the party.

1290
01:41:42,365 --> 01:41:43,415
Don't be startled
hearing all this.

1291
01:41:49,639 --> 01:41:52,599
Or else, he wouldn't have set forth
to do this, risking his life.

1292
01:41:59,382 --> 01:42:00,402
I wouldn't have contested.

1293
01:42:02,485 --> 01:42:05,525
He didn't say it because he didn't want
the party to become weak, Comrade.

1294
01:42:07,157 --> 01:42:08,827
His fight wasn't with the party.

1295
01:42:09,592 --> 01:42:10,932
It was against Mohanan alone.

1296
01:42:21,704 --> 01:42:23,014
Won't you be able to locate them?

1297
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:27,180
With the sources of the mail
sent and the video uploaded,

1298
01:42:29,179 --> 01:42:30,029
Why?

1299
01:42:32,682 --> 01:42:34,432
Singapore?
- Didn't I tell you over the phone?

1300
01:42:37,754 --> 01:42:40,974
With a spoofing software, one can
select the IP address of any country.

1301
01:42:42,358 --> 01:42:44,818
It will only show that it was connected
from a server in that country.

1302
01:42:45,662 --> 01:42:48,622
But, it wouldn't have happened
from that server at that time.

1303
01:42:50,066 --> 01:42:52,646
We have experienced that in
many online fraud cases.

1304
01:42:53,169 --> 01:42:54,129
Still, why don't you try?

1305
01:42:57,507 --> 01:43:00,757
State Home Ministry has to give a
request to the Central Home Ministry,

1306
01:43:01,344 --> 01:43:04,184
and finally Central Home Ministry
has to give a request to Interpol.

1307
01:43:05,315 --> 01:43:07,625
Interpol will investigate
that at the concerned server,

1308
01:43:08,017 --> 01:43:10,357
and the report has to come through all
the channels that it went through.

1309
01:43:12,188 --> 01:43:13,888
Even then, the result will be zero.

1310
01:43:16,426 --> 01:43:18,386
Sir, it's either a
hotel or a resort.

1311
01:43:19,262 --> 01:43:22,222
Even though it's feeble, we have identified
the sound of the sea in the soundtrack.

1312
01:43:23,533 --> 01:43:25,053
So, a beach resort.

1313
01:43:28,238 --> 01:43:29,528
Pondicherry,
Kerala Coast,

1314
01:43:30,106 --> 01:43:31,806
Karnataka, Goa,

1315
01:43:32,075 --> 01:43:33,275
they maybe anywhere
among these places.

1316
01:43:33,543 --> 01:43:35,823
Sir, let them upload
the coming episodes.

1317
01:43:36,512 --> 01:43:38,792
We will get the clue about the
location from that itself.

1318
01:43:42,018 --> 01:43:43,128
In case, if the need arises,

1319
01:43:45,154 --> 01:43:46,004
Definitely!

1320
01:44:04,073 --> 01:44:05,093
It has been announced that

1321
01:44:05,308 --> 01:44:08,268
the 2nd episode will be uploaded
on Hot Pursuit by 7.30 PM tonight.

1322
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:12,030
Kerala is waiting impatiently.

1323
01:44:12,181 --> 01:44:13,171
Get these details.

1324
01:44:14,117 --> 01:44:15,897
With just a few
seconds remaining,

1325
01:44:21,457 --> 01:44:22,357
Shouldn't he be killed?

1326
01:44:22,625 --> 01:44:24,115
I should kill him, right?

1327
01:44:26,229 --> 01:44:29,069
Oh! $0..
was it you?

1328
01:44:30,133 --> 01:44:31,273
I should have done it.

1329
01:44:32,669 --> 01:44:33,519
But..

1330
01:44:36,372 --> 01:44:37,222
Who did it?

1331
01:44:49,385 --> 01:44:50,235
Drink it.

1332
01:44:53,122 --> 01:44:54,262
I don't want it.

1333
01:44:56,626 --> 01:44:57,476
Drink it!

1334
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:04,979
Bloody! He is changing the route.

1335
01:45:10,473 --> 01:45:12,223
No one told me to do it
and I haven't done it.

1336
01:45:12,942 --> 01:45:13,812
You didn't do it?

1337
01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:15,070
Tell me, you ****

1338
01:45:23,586 --> 01:45:24,436
Stop!

1339
01:45:26,289 --> 01:45:27,139
Tell me!

1340
01:45:36,532 --> 01:45:38,342
Tell me the truth!
- Ramanunni won't do it.

1341
01:45:39,001 --> 01:45:40,781
Even if he has to kill him,
he should make him say it.

1342
01:45:41,104 --> 01:45:42,304
Ramanunni, I haven't done anything.
Don't hit me.

1343
01:45:46,709 --> 01:45:48,759
Ramanunni, don't hit me!

1344
01:45:55,551 --> 01:45:56,401
Hey!

1345
01:45:57,620 --> 01:45:59,110
Ramanunni, I haven't done anything!

1346
01:45:59,489 --> 01:46:00,979
Stop there!
- Believe me!

1347
01:46:07,330 --> 01:46:08,790
Ramanunni, don't hit me!

1348
01:46:12,635 --> 01:46:13,865
He's coming to kill me!

1349
01:46:32,622 --> 01:46:34,432
Don't hit me!
Don't hit me, please!

1350
01:46:35,525 --> 01:46:36,375
Don't hit me!

1351
01:46:50,606 --> 01:46:51,506
Tell me the truth.

1352
01:46:52,074 --> 01:46:53,884
I won't go behind bars for
something I haven't done.

1353
01:46:55,611 --> 01:46:56,811
I will kill you and go!

1354
01:46:58,548 --> 01:47:00,158
Tell me!
- I swear! I don't know!

1355
01:47:02,151 --> 01:47:04,701
When you got sloshed, didn't you cry
and say that you wanted to confess?

1356
01:47:05,121 --> 01:47:06,931
If it's not that, what the
hell do you want to confess?

1357
01:47:07,323 --> 01:47:08,223
You bloody..
- Don't hit me.

1358
01:47:08,424 --> 01:47:11,424
I'll tell you.

1359
01:47:11,627 --> 01:47:12,827
That bloody bastard,

1360
01:47:15,331 --> 01:47:18,171
He said that I needn't be so
sincere and hard-working for you,

1361
01:47:23,739 --> 01:47:24,589
Udayabhanu.

1362
01:47:30,746 --> 01:47:34,816
I told him about your election
strategies and daily programmes.

1363
01:47:36,786 --> 01:47:38,456
Who is it? Is it Udayabhanu who calls you?

1364
01:47:44,327 --> 01:47:45,347
When was the last time he called?

1365
01:47:45,595 --> 01:47:46,445
Last time..

1366
01:47:48,464 --> 01:47:49,314
That evening.

1367
01:47:51,667 --> 01:47:53,157
There was nothing
to say on that day.

1368
01:47:53,669 --> 01:47:55,189
I said that you're going
to watch the match.

1369
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:58,460
My dear Ramanunni,

1370
01:48:02,612 --> 01:48:04,252
To steal a bullet
from a gun is like..

1371
01:48:04,747 --> 01:48:06,917
I don't have the capability
to do such a huge treachery.

1372
01:48:10,219 --> 01:48:11,069
A buffalo!

1373
01:48:13,256 --> 01:48:14,246
Believe me, man!

1374
01:48:16,158 --> 01:48:17,008
Kill me!

1375
01:48:36,412 --> 01:48:37,232
Just one person.

1376
01:48:47,089 --> 01:48:49,719
While seizing the gun from home, is it
so difficult for him to remove a bullet?

1377
01:48:50,593 --> 01:48:52,323
What if the party had
decided to trap you?

1378
01:48:56,299 --> 01:48:57,149
No!

1379
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:58,450
He won't do that.

1380
01:48:59,068 --> 01:49:00,998
If he traps me, the original
culprit would escape.

1381
01:49:06,676 --> 01:49:07,986
Then try and remember.

1382
01:49:08,444 --> 01:49:10,814
Are you sure that you had loaded six
bullets in the gun that day?

1383
01:49:28,598 --> 01:49:29,448
Yes.

1384
01:49:32,568 --> 01:49:33,968
On the day of the core
committee meeting,

1385
01:49:34,270 --> 01:49:36,320
I had gone to the rifle club
for practice in the morning.

1386
01:49:39,041 --> 01:49:40,271
That means, six bullets each.

1387
01:49:42,178 --> 01:49:43,488
I could shoot only one bullet.

1388
01:49:45,681 --> 01:49:47,051
Asking me to reach
Kochi at 10 AM.

1389
01:49:49,685 --> 01:49:51,115
Yes, dude! The trainer Siby Chacko.

1390
01:49:52,588 --> 01:49:53,848
Oh Holy Mother!

1391
01:49:58,494 --> 01:49:59,574
Did it hurt?
- Get lost!

1392
01:50:00,329 --> 01:50:02,319
Don't make me curse you..

1393
01:50:05,234 --> 01:50:06,784
My leg. He broke it.

1394
01:50:08,638 --> 01:50:10,128
What is he going to do?

1395
01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:15,830
They didn't say when the
next episode will be aired.

1396
01:50:17,246 --> 01:50:19,056
Freeze and zoom every visual
to check it thoroughly.

1397
01:50:19,649 --> 01:50:21,789
For any property, instrument, name..

1398
01:50:22,184 --> 01:50:24,024
Anything which we can use
to track the location..

1399
01:50:24,353 --> 01:50:25,203
Give it to me.

1400
01:50:28,190 --> 01:50:29,300
Take him into custody
immediately.

1401
01:50:29,592 --> 01:50:31,232
The media shouldn't
get him before us.

1402
01:50:33,429 --> 01:50:35,799
All of you guys with this 'red'
background have this thought.

1403
01:50:36,599 --> 01:50:38,909
That all the people dressed in
'Khadi' are cowardly scumbags.

1404
01:50:39,702 --> 01:50:40,572
Isn't that why,

1405
01:50:40,770 --> 01:50:43,760
you hit me like a dog for something
which you weren't sure at all?

1406
01:50:51,781 --> 01:50:52,921
Do you want to go back?

1407
01:50:53,616 --> 01:50:55,076
Wherever we go, we
will go together.

1408
01:50:57,486 --> 01:50:58,336
TC,

1409
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:03,320
If I go alone, I have to get
beaten up for both of us, right?

1410
01:51:03,993 --> 01:51:05,393
Why should I stop you
from getting your share?

1411
01:51:06,996 --> 01:51:08,336
If we are beaten up, both
of us should get it.

1412
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:11,950
Don't laugh!

1413
01:51:13,969 --> 01:51:15,339
Did you know anything?
- There's a bad news.

1414
01:51:16,972 --> 01:51:18,202
We don't have anything
else to expect.

1415
01:51:21,110 --> 01:51:22,750
It will be filed in the High
Court day after tomorrow.

1416
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:27,160
There are many missing links in the
police's circumstantial evidence.

1417
01:51:27,650 --> 01:51:28,820
Let us sort it out.
We'll do it after that.

1418
01:51:32,088 --> 01:51:34,108
If they get any clue and
catch you from here;

1419
01:51:35,991 --> 01:51:37,071
For hiding the culprits.

1420
01:51:39,028 --> 01:51:40,758
With the exception from IPC 216,

1421
01:51:41,130 --> 01:51:43,090
if the wife has hidden the
culprit, they can't charge a case.

1422
01:51:45,367 --> 01:51:47,447
The exemption is valid even for the
girl who's going to be his wife.

1423
01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:51,289
What's there to
understand in this?

1424
01:51:53,142 --> 01:51:54,952
For the time being, only this
political issue is on my mind.

1425
01:51:57,713 --> 01:51:59,793
We have a lot of time to
romance and get married!

1426
01:52:00,182 --> 01:52:01,032
What? How?

1427
01:52:01,317 --> 01:52:02,167
We will live.

1428
01:52:03,452 --> 01:52:05,002
I can promise you
only that much now.

1429
01:52:07,623 --> 01:52:08,473
Love you too!

1430
01:52:12,194 --> 01:52:13,044
Don't say anything!

1431
01:52:15,131 --> 01:52:15,981
Get lost!

1432
01:52:17,733 --> 01:52:19,483
Public-Friendly Police
Station, Thodupuzha

1433
01:52:25,508 --> 01:52:27,178
By which law did you
arrest the witness, Sir?

1434
01:52:27,543 --> 01:52:29,093
We haven't arrested him. We
called him to get his statement.

1435
01:52:29,411 --> 01:52:30,461
Sir! Sir..
- Please move!

1436
01:52:40,222 --> 01:52:41,562
Did you watch the programme?
- Yes sir.

1437
01:52:43,125 --> 01:52:44,235
Which happened in your presence,

1438
01:52:47,229 --> 01:52:48,899
I can say it correctly if I
check the daily register.

1439
01:52:49,298 --> 01:52:50,938
We'll check all that later.
Continue.

1440
01:53:03,212 --> 01:53:04,062
Here.

1441
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:07,170
If our stance is like this,
the recoil will be in our control.

1442
01:53:10,653 --> 01:53:11,503
Try.

1443
01:53:18,994 --> 01:53:19,844
Phone!

1444
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:32,250
I'll reach there, sir.
Okay.

1445
01:53:35,244 --> 01:53:36,414
Can't you go after
finishing this?

1446
01:53:39,048 --> 01:53:39,948
I have a meeting at 10 AM.

1447
01:53:42,351 --> 01:53:43,931
Did Ramanunni come
anytime after that?

1448
01:53:46,355 --> 01:53:48,105
The relevant page from
the daily register.

1449
01:53:50,492 --> 01:53:51,892
Sir, procedure is simple.

1450
01:53:52,661 --> 01:53:53,951
ADGP Intelligence,

1451
01:53:56,599 --> 01:53:59,029
To the DG of Indian Computer
Emergency Response Team,

1452
01:53:59,501 --> 01:54:00,961
a request has to be mailed.

1453
01:54:01,437 --> 01:54:02,987
Maximum 48 hours.

1454
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:06,060
I think there's
nothing to worry.

1455
01:54:08,344 --> 01:54:11,124
They haven't announced when and on which
date the next episode will be online.

1456
01:54:13,482 --> 01:54:15,232
Siby Chacko, who was not
allowed to meet the media,

1457
01:54:15,584 --> 01:54:18,014
and was kept in custody for 2
hours in Thodupuzha Cl Office,

1458
01:54:18,454 --> 01:54:20,234
was questioned by the Police
& a statement was recorded.

1459
01:54:20,556 --> 01:54:22,866
I have said everything I had to
say, to Sir, at the station.

1460
01:54:23,626 --> 01:54:26,906
The incident when Ramanunni mentioned
that a bullet was missing from his gun,

1461
01:54:29,031 --> 01:54:31,991
Siby Chacko revealed to the media
that it's absolutely true.

1462
01:54:42,678 --> 01:54:43,528
Sheesh!

1463
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:45,049
These guys are lagging it so much.

1464
01:54:45,681 --> 01:54:47,171
Will we get an
episode for tomorrow?

1465
01:54:50,219 --> 01:54:51,069
Let's see.

1466
01:54:53,722 --> 01:54:54,572
TC,

1467
01:55:00,329 --> 01:55:03,259
Now the party and Paulson know
that I wasn't the one who did it.

1468
01:55:04,300 --> 01:55:05,530
But until the election is over,

1469
01:55:07,036 --> 01:55:09,086
what if they want me
to be accused of it?

1470
01:55:09,705 --> 01:55:10,555
Well,

1471
01:55:10,973 --> 01:55:12,023
what if I win?

1472
01:55:12,975 --> 01:55:14,175
After this election,

1473
01:55:16,312 --> 01:55:17,862
and they can catch the
original culprit, right?

1474
01:55:20,082 --> 01:55:21,102
What are you thinking?

1475
01:55:23,385 --> 01:55:25,345
There's an innocence on her face.

1476
01:55:25,721 --> 01:55:27,181
But none at all in her behaviour.

1477
01:55:28,590 --> 01:55:29,960
That girl. Hallelujah!

1478
01:55:30,259 --> 01:55:31,109
Hallelujah?

1479
01:55:33,295 --> 01:55:35,225
There is a slight
femininity in her walk.

1480
01:55:40,402 --> 01:55:42,392
She's not the type of girl
you can marry, Ramanunni.

1481
01:55:43,072 --> 01:55:44,802
You can flirt around for
time pass if you want to.

1482
01:55:46,742 --> 01:55:47,592
Are you done?

1483
01:55:49,645 --> 01:55:51,695
You have to escape
smoothly. That's best.

1484
01:55:53,215 --> 01:55:54,235
I shall escape.

1485
01:55:57,019 --> 01:55:57,919
You and your bloody..

1486
01:56:03,525 --> 01:56:05,045
So did you find a way to escape?

1487
01:56:05,394 --> 01:56:06,244
Tell me.

1488
01:56:06,695 --> 01:56:08,425
Are you sober enough to listen?

1489
01:56:09,031 --> 01:56:10,811
Of course! One more
peg & I'll be fresh!

1490
01:56:12,968 --> 01:56:13,868
Go have a bath and come.

1491
01:56:15,070 --> 01:56:16,440
Bathe at 2 AM in the morning?

1492
01:56:16,972 --> 01:56:18,022
I won't do that.

1493
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:19,790
There's a bath that
you can take at 2 AM.

1494
01:56:20,075 --> 01:56:20,925
Come!

1495
01:56:22,311 --> 01:56:23,331
I'm not the marriageable
type, it seems!

1496
01:56:26,115 --> 01:56:27,285
If I have said that I'll shoot,

1497
01:56:28,117 --> 01:56:30,227
I will shoot only in front of ten
or more people in broad daylight!

1498
01:56:45,034 --> 01:56:46,374
Push me down once more. Once more!

1499
01:56:50,372 --> 01:56:51,222
Ramanunni,

1500
01:56:51,673 --> 01:56:53,423
now I am okay. You can talk now.

1501
01:56:55,611 --> 01:56:56,541
Whoever might have killed him,

1502
01:56:57,679 --> 01:56:59,139
why did they kill him?

1503
01:57:01,583 --> 01:57:02,543
Wash your head again!

1504
01:57:06,288 --> 01:57:07,278
Dude, apart from me;

1505
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:10,750
who else would be so angry that
they would want to kill Mohanan?

1506
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:13,470
He got many people killed, right?

1507
01:57:16,131 --> 01:57:17,091
If it's one of them,

1508
01:57:17,366 --> 01:57:20,026
would they do such a planned
murder with a silencer-attached gun?

1509
01:57:20,536 --> 01:57:23,196
According to the tradition of our land,
they would only stab him to death, right?

1510
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:26,820
Since all the other guns
except mine are surrendered,

1511
01:57:27,509 --> 01:57:30,609
it's sure that Mohanan was
killed using an illegal gun.

1512
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:32,810
But this bullet has
to suit it, right?

1513
01:57:33,148 --> 01:57:34,258
You idiot!
- Yes!

1514
01:57:34,516 --> 01:57:36,326
A bullet from any .32 revolver,

1515
01:57:36,718 --> 01:57:38,938
will fit into any .32
revolver of any brand.

1516
01:57:39,354 --> 01:57:40,814
The cartridges are
all in standard size.

1517
01:57:42,291 --> 01:57:43,991
So that's all this
ballistics is about!

1518
01:57:45,761 --> 01:57:48,391
Mohanan has to be killed,
and I have to be framed.

1519
01:57:49,631 --> 01:57:51,441
Who needs both these
things to happen equally?

1520
01:57:59,408 --> 01:58:00,258
Ramanunni!

1521
01:58:03,479 --> 01:58:04,379
It's him!

1522
01:58:06,215 --> 01:58:07,115
Udayabhanu!

1523
01:58:09,585 --> 01:58:11,835
Who else will have so
much rage against Mohanan?

1524
01:58:12,721 --> 01:58:15,061
Even though he was cut into pieces,
he bounced back in shape, right?

1525
01:58:20,195 --> 01:58:21,305
It's him!

1526
01:58:24,566 --> 01:58:25,416
Scoundrel!

1527
01:58:26,135 --> 01:58:28,065
Either him, or Sudhi.

1528
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:33,660
They both would have been there at
the first class gallery on that day.

1529
01:58:37,613 --> 01:58:40,773
Why didn't Paulson Devassy notice that
while checking the reservation chart?

1530
01:58:43,619 --> 01:58:46,749
Or else, Udayabhanu wouldn't have
reserved his seat in his own name.

1531
01:58:47,289 --> 01:58:48,429
Why do you need the chart?

1532
01:58:48,657 --> 01:58:50,297
If they were there, someone
would have seen them, right?

1533
01:58:50,626 --> 01:58:51,966
Channels will have videos, right?

1534
01:58:52,261 --> 01:58:54,431
Moreover, how many people
would've shot selfies & videos?

1535
01:58:56,532 --> 01:58:57,552
Who should be checking it?

1536
01:58:58,200 --> 01:58:59,400
After crowning me as the culprit,

1537
01:58:59,668 --> 01:59:02,358
that DYSP Paulson Devassy is sitting
and dreaming of police medals.

1538
01:59:03,138 --> 01:59:04,158
Ajay! Till here.

1539
01:59:06,141 --> 01:59:06,961
From where?

1540
01:59:08,343 --> 01:59:09,893
But skip the comments
about me in between.

1541
01:59:16,752 --> 01:59:17,602
That's true.

1542
01:59:20,189 --> 01:59:22,799
Something to laugh about, or
something to be relieved about?

1543
01:59:27,362 --> 01:59:28,212
I know that.

1544
01:59:28,463 --> 01:59:29,313
H ow?

1545
01:59:30,098 --> 01:59:32,118
Didn't I tell you that
Udayabhanu threatened me?

1546
01:59:32,534 --> 01:59:34,994
That was not just
threatening with words.

1547
01:59:35,470 --> 01:59:39,600
He spoke after getting the gun from Sudhi's
waist and pointing it at my rib cage!

1548
01:59:40,642 --> 01:59:42,282
Hey! Did you notice that gun?

1549
01:59:42,578 --> 01:59:43,628
Was it a revolver or a pistol?

1550
01:59:45,113 --> 01:59:47,223
Well, while pressing the
trigger, it goes round..

1551
01:59:47,583 --> 01:59:48,433
Isn't that a revolver?

1552
01:59:48,750 --> 01:59:50,010
Yes!
- So it's a revolver.

1553
01:59:51,653 --> 01:59:55,873
Dude, did you notice the
opening of it's barrel?

1554
01:59:56,992 --> 01:59:59,212
Was it the same size
as my gun's opening?

1555
02:00:00,662 --> 02:00:03,792
I'll put my finger and measure
the opening while I am at gunpoint!

1556
02:00:05,167 --> 02:00:06,017
Okay.

1557
02:00:06,201 --> 02:00:07,431
So one thing is for sure.

1558
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:10,950
Since it wasn't surrendered,
that gun is illegal.

1559
02:00:12,975 --> 02:00:15,115
Imagine that their gun
and your gun are similar.

1560
02:00:16,011 --> 02:00:17,001
Didn't you ask earlier,

1561
02:00:17,279 --> 02:00:19,359
that how will you shoot when
the police is next to you?

1562
02:00:23,252 --> 02:00:25,302
It's sure that the shot was
fired from first class gallery.

1563
02:00:28,023 --> 02:00:29,803
If so, like you suspect Udayabhanu;

1564
02:00:32,261 --> 02:00:33,111
Right?

1565
02:00:35,597 --> 02:00:38,317
He wasn't wearing a coat or a
jacket like a professional killer.

1566
02:00:39,001 --> 02:00:40,401
He sat there wearing a
'Mundu' & shirt, right?

1567
02:00:40,702 --> 02:00:43,282
If he takes out a gun, people sitting next
to him or in front of him may not notice.

1568
02:00:45,674 --> 02:00:46,634
It's a gallery, right?

1569
02:00:52,281 --> 02:00:54,941
If you want to clearly know how
the shot was fired, there's one way.

1570
02:00:55,584 --> 02:00:57,284
Just call 'Malayala
Rama' newspaper.

1571
02:00:57,586 --> 02:00:59,956
They will make a proper drawing
including a chart, and give you!

1572
02:01:01,990 --> 02:01:04,920
If Udayabhanu can do it,
I can also do it, right?

1573
02:01:07,195 --> 02:01:08,045
Sit down.

1574
02:01:13,535 --> 02:01:15,145
No! For example. I am Sudhi.

1575
02:01:16,171 --> 02:01:17,541
Sudhi must be the one who shot.

1576
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:19,210
He is the gunman, right?

1577
02:01:22,678 --> 02:01:23,818
That means, a silencer.

1578
02:01:24,479 --> 02:01:26,939
If I hold this in my hand, no one
would doubt me. It's a cola can, right?

1579
02:01:27,382 --> 02:01:30,342
When it was the right time, he took the
gun from his waist & put it into the can,

1580
02:01:31,186 --> 02:01:32,386
Didn't they talk about a cola can?

1581
02:01:34,456 --> 02:01:36,096
Red Bull, Coca Cola, Thums Up?

1582
02:01:36,692 --> 02:01:38,182
That has to be checked. Why?

1583
02:01:41,196 --> 02:01:42,066
Come. Let's check.

1584
02:01:44,066 --> 02:01:45,406
Udayabhanu is addicted to Red Bull.

1585
02:01:45,767 --> 02:01:46,997
He cannot survive without that.

1586
02:01:47,235 --> 02:01:49,345
He drinks minimum
5-6 of them daily.

1587
02:01:50,172 --> 02:01:51,022
Phew!

1588
02:01:51,273 --> 02:01:53,443
If we could get some photo or
video of him sitting in the gallery;

1589
02:01:54,076 --> 02:01:56,096
In it, if he has a Red
Bull can in his hand;

1590
02:01:56,511 --> 02:01:59,581
if the police didn't find any other
empty Red Bull can from the gallery;

1591
02:02:03,518 --> 02:02:04,858
Didn't you get
anything else to say?

1592
02:02:06,521 --> 02:02:07,571
So sad!
- I said that in excitement.

1593
02:02:09,157 --> 02:02:10,887
Statements from 12
witnesses corroborating it.

1594
02:02:11,293 --> 02:02:13,403
We have sufficient and
conclusive evidence.

1595
02:02:15,230 --> 02:02:17,070
This gun has palm
prints of two people.

1596
02:02:20,135 --> 02:02:23,825
This is a soft drink can that the police
found from the first class gallery.

1597
02:02:27,275 --> 02:02:28,505
It's Red Bull! Red Bull!

1598
02:02:35,417 --> 02:02:37,817
We have to mail a detailed note to
the lawyer first thing in the morning.

1599
02:02:38,253 --> 02:02:39,773
We have to move to the
High Court today itself.

1600
02:02:41,590 --> 02:02:43,080
4 days is a lot of time.

1601
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:46,310
We will get a video camera,

1602
02:02:46,628 --> 02:02:49,208
and you should explain all this
in detail standing in front of it.

1603
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:52,670
Showing this.

1604
02:02:53,335 --> 02:02:56,525
We will send copies of it
to Paulson and the media.

1605
02:02:57,139 --> 02:02:59,219
Like LTTE Prabhakaran
and Bin Laden did,

1606
02:03:02,577 --> 02:03:04,657
Don't make me grow so much, TC!

1607
02:03:05,514 --> 02:03:06,564
Let's move legally.

1608
02:03:08,183 --> 02:03:09,413
Then I'll go have a peg.

1609
02:03:14,122 --> 02:03:16,902
Are these evidences enough to
send Udayabhanu to the jail?

1610
02:03:17,526 --> 02:03:18,866
It's not about
getting him punished;

1611
02:03:21,730 --> 02:03:24,220
The accused needn't prove his
innocence in a criminal case;

1612
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,960
even if we create a cloud
over the prosecution case;

1613
02:03:28,637 --> 02:03:30,007
we will get the benefit of doubt.

1614
02:03:31,306 --> 02:03:33,206
After that, to arrest Udayabhanu
and proceed with the trials,

1615
02:03:33,575 --> 02:03:34,885
these are more than enough!

1616
02:03:35,644 --> 02:03:38,134
So I can have 4 more drinks
peacefully, right? Okay!

1617
02:03:39,581 --> 02:03:41,721
This is for Udayabhanu.
You bloody rascal fellow!

1618
02:03:47,689 --> 02:03:48,619
This is more than enough.

1619
02:03:50,158 --> 02:03:52,738
We need a tail punch episode to shoot
out on the day before the elections.

1620
02:03:54,129 --> 02:03:57,759
Ayikkara's dearest son, and the
leader of people-friendly development;

1621
02:03:58,567 --> 02:04:04,457
Sumesh Venjara's election campaign
vehicle is passing before you right now.

1622
02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:06,740
Hey! Stop!

1623
02:04:07,042 --> 02:04:07,892
Stop, I say!

1624
02:04:08,643 --> 02:04:09,953
Why should we stop here?

1625
02:04:10,212 --> 02:04:11,732
Shouldn't you be
giving a speech at <i>7</i> PM?

1626
02:04:12,047 --> 02:04:13,217
You go and give a
speech there, dad!

1627
02:04:15,450 --> 02:04:18,230
Now the party and Paulson know
that I wasn't the one who did it.

1628
02:04:21,223 --> 02:04:23,063
What if they want me
to be accused of it?

1629
02:04:25,126 --> 02:04:26,906
She's not a fraud, but..

1630
02:04:27,262 --> 02:04:29,192
She's not the type of girl
you can marry, Ramanunni.

1631
02:04:29,564 --> 02:04:31,314
You can flirt around for
time pass if you want to.

1632
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:32,520
That's enough.

1633
02:04:34,002 --> 02:04:35,372
If you flirt, she won't leave you.

1634
02:04:38,106 --> 02:04:38,956
Okay.

1635
02:04:46,181 --> 02:04:47,031
Get lost, man!

1636
02:04:49,284 --> 02:04:51,034
If that's not the case and
this was taken seriously,

1637
02:04:51,419 --> 02:04:53,319
that Paulson Devassy
is such an idiot!

1638
02:04:54,756 --> 02:04:56,336
When two policemen are
sitting on my either side;

1639
02:04:57,192 --> 02:04:59,272
I shot him down with a
silencer-attached gun it seems!

1640
02:05:02,330 --> 02:05:03,500
If I was the one who shot it..

1641
02:05:07,235 --> 02:05:09,845
He easily got a sensational
political murder, right?

1642
02:05:10,338 --> 02:05:11,448
So when he got a chance,

1643
02:05:14,009 --> 02:05:14,909
That's the truth!

1644
02:05:17,512 --> 02:05:20,122
I will shoot only in front of ten
or more people in broad daylight

1645
02:05:21,283 --> 02:05:23,743
I left CDP praying to God for
a life imprisonment punishment.

1646
02:05:25,587 --> 02:05:27,867
I was just waiting for my
mom to win in the elections.

1647
02:05:31,326 --> 02:05:33,436
I shouldn't win in
NSP's banner, TC.

1648
02:05:36,131 --> 02:05:39,561
Anyway, your seat was a result of that
bloody scoundrel Sagar Nagadom's game,

1649
02:05:40,135 --> 02:05:41,535
to get rid of Udayabhanu;

1650
02:05:49,644 --> 02:05:50,544
Hey Sudhi!

1651
02:05:54,049 --> 02:05:56,659
Mohanan has to be killed, and
I have to be framed as well.

1652
02:06:10,298 --> 02:06:11,148
Ramanunni!

1653
02:06:13,301 --> 02:06:14,151
It's him!    www.TamilMV.re

1654
02:06:14,302 --> 02:06:15,262
So you are saying that?

1655
02:06:21,376 --> 02:06:22,336
Udayabhanu?

1656
02:06:26,481 --> 02:06:27,331
It's him!

1657
02:06:31,286 --> 02:06:33,426
Even though he was cut into pieces,
he bounced back in shape, right?

1658
02:06:34,289 --> 02:06:36,399
That's when I was
appointed over his head.

1659
02:06:38,994 --> 02:06:39,924
Bloody bastard!

1660
02:06:49,571 --> 02:06:51,271
Udayabhanu was at the first
class gallery. I saw him.

1661
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:53,370
I also saw him. And the
other guy was also with him.

1662
02:06:53,675 --> 02:06:55,815
- Udayabhanu wouldn't have
reserved his seat in his own name.

1663
02:06:56,211 --> 02:06:57,821
Why do you need the
chart? If they were there..

1664
02:06:58,113 --> 02:06:58,963
Sudhi!

1665
02:07:01,650 --> 02:07:03,230
Hide the gun somewhere immediately.

1666
02:07:03,718 --> 02:07:05,178
If they catch it,
we will have to hang.

1667
02:07:08,356 --> 02:07:09,556
Throw it away somewhere.

1668
02:07:19,367 --> 02:07:22,177
Call some channel immediately
and arrange an interview of mine.

1669
02:07:23,271 --> 02:07:24,121
Make it fast.

1670
02:07:26,741 --> 02:07:27,971
Yes. Paulson Devassy.

1671
02:07:30,011 --> 02:07:31,321
They have to be
shadowed immediately.

1672
02:07:32,414 --> 02:07:34,144
I have already sent my squad.

1673
02:07:34,482 --> 02:07:35,332
Okay.

1674
02:07:35,483 --> 02:07:38,913
Through conversations
which are private,

1675
02:07:39,487 --> 02:07:42,617
Ramanunni who is doing his own
analysis of the Mohanan murder;

1676
02:07:45,026 --> 02:07:47,246
that the murderer is NSP
Palakkad District President,

1677
02:07:47,729 --> 02:07:48,579
Udayabhanu.

1678
02:07:49,064 --> 02:07:51,694
The police's findings which
seem to be complete rubbish;

1679
02:07:52,167 --> 02:07:53,247
inaccuracies in the investigation;

1680
02:07:53,468 --> 02:07:55,688
Ramanunni is negating them
with logical questions.

1681
02:07:56,304 --> 02:07:58,054
The baseless thoughts.

1682
02:07:58,406 --> 02:08:00,276
The new episode of Hot Pursuit

1683
02:08:00,642 --> 02:08:02,952
which has dialogues and visuals
that increase its authenticity.

1684
02:08:05,013 --> 02:08:08,793
Ramanunni is back in the spotlight with
interesting and thought-provoking topics.

1685
02:08:09,417 --> 02:08:13,077
Ramanunni is carving his own destiny
in Kerala Politics, this time.

1686
02:08:13,688 --> 02:08:16,848
Ramanunni, who set forth to become
a successor to Sukumara Kurup;

1687
02:08:17,425 --> 02:08:20,995
'Compass' is looking at the visuals
from the hidden cameras at his hideout.

1688
02:08:26,134 --> 02:08:26,984
We saw him.

1689
02:08:27,135 --> 02:08:27,985
Yes.

1690
02:08:29,104 --> 02:08:30,804
Was he there from the
beginning? Did you notice?

1691
02:08:35,677 --> 02:08:37,347
I don't know if he was
there since the beginning.

1692
02:08:40,682 --> 02:08:41,532
Sir!

1693
02:08:49,557 --> 02:08:50,407
Paulson Sir?

1694
02:08:54,395 --> 02:08:56,445
Udayabhanu's name is not
there in the reservation chart.

1695
02:08:59,267 --> 02:09:00,167
There are eye-witnesses.

1696
02:09:02,270 --> 02:09:04,410
Sir, the chart was prepared with
the names of those who booked seats.

1697
02:09:09,110 --> 02:09:11,950
He entered the gallery without
a reservation ticket, right?

1698
02:09:14,182 --> 02:09:15,822
Who will dare to
stop him if he comes?

1699
02:09:17,986 --> 02:09:20,036
If I had seen him, I definitely
would have stopped him, sir.

1700
02:09:20,388 --> 02:09:22,908
Most probably, he would have reserved
the seat in someone else's name.

1701
02:09:24,659 --> 02:09:26,329
The visuals from the
gallery are being checked.

1702
02:09:26,995 --> 02:09:29,275
We will talk after locating
the exact seat that he sat on.

1703
02:09:31,466 --> 02:09:33,196
Get all the details of Udayabhanu.

1704
02:09:33,535 --> 02:09:35,025
Sir, if we take this route,

1705
02:09:35,336 --> 02:09:36,886
won't it be proved that
we were wrong earlier?

1706
02:09:37,272 --> 02:09:38,262
This is Kerala, man!

1707
02:09:40,441 --> 02:09:42,691
The media and public
would force us to.

1708
02:09:43,411 --> 02:09:45,461
If we have made a mistake,
there's no shame in rectifying it.

1709
02:09:47,782 --> 02:09:49,972
What's there so much to
investigate about that?

1710
02:09:50,718 --> 02:09:51,568
It's true!

1711
02:09:54,189 --> 02:09:55,939
Sudhi was also with
me. My assistant!

1712
02:09:56,424 --> 02:09:58,234
Were you at the gallery since
the beginning of the game?

1713
02:10:00,161 --> 02:10:02,821
I had a meeting with the state
president Sagar Nagamadom that day.

1714
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:06,070
Then let me ask you..

1715
02:10:06,334 --> 02:10:07,414
Stop your trial..

1716
02:10:07,635 --> 02:10:09,805
Will I be the murdererjust
because Ramanunni said so?

1717
02:10:10,338 --> 02:10:13,298
How can he say that I did the murder
because I was present in the gallery?

1718
02:10:14,008 --> 02:10:17,288
Udayabhanu's & Sudhi's names are not on
the first class gallery's reservation chart.

1719
02:10:20,014 --> 02:10:21,474
If so, why can't you be suspected?

1720
02:10:24,018 --> 02:10:24,868
Yes!

1721
02:10:26,387 --> 02:10:28,347
I definitely went there
by reserving a seat.

1722
02:10:29,023 --> 02:10:32,063
But I don't know why my name
is not on the reservation chart.

1723
02:10:35,630 --> 02:10:37,970
We have received an
explosive report now.

1724
02:10:39,167 --> 02:10:42,187
An hour back, Udayabhanu's assistant
Sudhi was taken into Police custody.

1725
02:10:45,607 --> 02:10:49,267
An unlicensed .32 revolver
was also seized from Sudhi.

1726
02:10:51,379 --> 02:10:53,809
The reports that we
received suggest that

1727
02:10:56,551 --> 02:10:57,921
Udayabhanu!
- Get lost!

1728
02:11:08,596 --> 02:11:10,676
Sir, what's your reaction
on Sudhi's arrest?

1729
02:11:11,099 --> 02:11:12,799
I don't want to say anything. Move!

1730
02:11:13,635 --> 02:11:15,155
Move away!

1731
02:11:18,539 --> 02:11:19,939
Move! Make way!

1732
02:11:27,248 --> 02:11:28,208
We have a lot of questions.

1733
02:11:29,684 --> 02:11:30,974
Let's go.
- No.

1734
02:11:33,187 --> 02:11:34,037
Move backwards.

1735
02:11:36,291 --> 02:11:38,341
Haven't those guys gone for the campaign at
Pingalan1 ward? - They went in the morning.

1736
02:11:38,693 --> 02:11:40,303
Hot Pursuit is banned.
The news is on TV.

1737
02:11:42,030 --> 02:11:42,880
Come.

1738
02:11:43,031 --> 02:11:45,341
Hot Pursuit is just
a fake sting operation

1739
02:11:49,704 --> 02:11:51,104
We have received proper
evidence for that.

1740
02:11:54,409 --> 02:11:56,189
That's why the site is being blocked.
- What is this?

1741
02:11:58,413 --> 02:12:00,903
We didn't receive any evidence
connecting him to the murder.

1742
02:12:01,582 --> 02:12:04,332
When there is just one day remaining
for the campaign to end in Ayikkara,

1743
02:12:04,986 --> 02:12:07,916
the blocking of Hot Pursuit's
website in such a hurry,

1744
02:12:08,423 --> 02:12:12,523
is being analysed generally as CDP's
political destitution being exposed.

1745
02:12:15,129 --> 02:12:16,359
This will affect the party gravely.

1746
02:12:16,631 --> 02:12:18,061
Provoking the public for no reason?

1747
02:12:31,612 --> 02:12:32,462
Sir.

1748
02:12:39,387 --> 02:12:40,937
The distance from where
the shot was fired,

1749
02:12:48,730 --> 02:12:50,870
We cannot return your mobile now.

1750
02:12:51,666 --> 02:12:52,516
This is an exhibit.

1751
02:12:52,734 --> 02:12:54,724
Deepak - Sir
- Give him his SIM card.

1752
02:12:55,036 --> 02:12:57,026
Then record his statement &
prepare the crime scene description.

1753
02:13:01,976 --> 02:13:04,816
Police should stop their injustice!

1754
02:13:05,313 --> 02:13:09,823
Cancel the ban on hot pursuit.

1755
02:13:10,551 --> 02:13:13,571
DYSP Paulson should resign!

1756
02:13:14,088 --> 02:13:16,608
Resign and step out!

1757
02:13:18,559 --> 02:13:19,409
Why?

1758
02:13:25,299 --> 02:13:26,879
Yes?
- Sir, hot pursuit's fourth episode.

1759
02:13:31,039 --> 02:13:32,149
They are showing
that on TV now, Sir.

1760
02:13:32,407 --> 02:13:35,097
(It will be telecast on
Reporter Channel at 3 PM)

1761
02:13:43,418 --> 02:13:44,268
1 .45

1762
02:13:44,619 --> 02:13:46,259
Send all the e-mails
to my private folder.

1763
02:13:46,621 --> 02:13:48,171
Do not pick up any party calls.

1764
02:13:50,124 --> 02:13:51,174
Check all the mails properly.

1765
02:13:54,462 --> 02:13:55,512
Paulson Devassy. DYSP.

1766
02:13:55,997 --> 02:13:57,987
Important people from the party
& ministry have already called.

1767
02:13:58,433 --> 02:13:59,483
The 'NO' that I told all of them;

1768
02:14:05,073 --> 02:14:07,353
I didn't come here to tell
you not to telecast it.

1769
02:14:08,476 --> 02:14:09,476
Then?

1770
02:14:09,477 --> 02:14:11,877
Before you telecast it, you
should show that episode to me.

1771
02:14:13,114 --> 02:14:14,104
No way, man!

1772
02:14:17,051 --> 02:14:18,721
I mean something
regarding the evidence;

1773
02:14:19,253 --> 02:14:21,623
once you telecast it, those evidences
would be destroyed immediately.

1774
02:14:25,193 --> 02:14:26,063
Okay.

1775
02:14:27,161 --> 02:14:29,851
They have told us that the episode
would be mailed to us at 2.30 PM.

1776
02:14:30,531 --> 02:14:32,231
Only because connecting
programmes are scheduled,

1777
02:14:32,633 --> 02:14:34,153
we fixed the telecast at 3 PM.

1778
02:14:39,707 --> 02:14:40,557
Ask me!

1779
02:14:42,610 --> 02:14:45,330
In today's episode, if you get any
solid evidence against Udayabhanu,

1780
02:14:46,147 --> 02:14:47,897
will you arrest
Udayabhanu today itself?

1781
02:14:49,450 --> 02:14:50,850
Within half an hour, that means;

1782
02:14:53,354 --> 02:14:54,284
he will be arrested!

1783
02:14:57,125 --> 02:14:57,975
If we do that,

1784
02:14:58,159 --> 02:15:01,259
Can you give a news bulletin
saying that I arrested Udayabhanu,

1785
02:15:01,996 --> 02:15:04,956
with solid evidence,
before you got this episode?

1786
02:15:07,168 --> 02:15:08,308
Honest Intention!

1787
02:15:08,569 --> 02:15:10,759
I want to get rid of this
'Jittery Jack' nickname.

1788
02:15:14,008 --> 02:15:15,848
Dude, if it's Red Bull,
our route is clear!

1789
02:15:16,177 --> 02:15:17,227
Come! Let's check!

1790
02:15:18,646 --> 02:15:20,456
Udayabhanu is addicted to Red Bull.

1791
02:15:22,250 --> 02:15:24,240
He drinks minimum
5-6 of them daily.

1792
02:15:26,087 --> 02:15:28,397
If we could get some photo or
video of him sitting in the gallery;

1793
02:15:29,023 --> 02:15:31,103
In it, if he has a Red
Bull can in his hand;

1794
02:15:31,492 --> 02:15:34,242
if the police didn't find any other
empty Red Bull can from the gallery;

1795
02:15:35,997 --> 02:15:38,957
Check if Udayabhanu or Sudhi had a Red
Bull can with them in that mobile video.

1796
02:15:40,635 --> 02:15:42,035
Only we need to know this. Quick!

1797
02:15:42,603 --> 02:15:44,713
I said that in excitement.
Was it cheap, Ramanunni?

1798
02:15:45,439 --> 02:15:47,869
We have to mail a detailed note to
the lawyer first thing in the morning.

1799
02:15:48,309 --> 02:15:50,939
Was any other empty Red Bull
can recovered from there?

1800
02:16:11,265 --> 02:16:13,405
Then prepare a remand request
& come fast to the guest house.

1801
02:16:16,204 --> 02:16:17,984
We should report to
the court before 5 PM.

1802
02:16:19,407 --> 02:16:21,307
And,
the entire responsibility is mine!

1803
02:16:24,045 --> 02:16:25,215
Say that all decisions
were made by me.

1804
02:16:38,326 --> 02:16:39,936
Government Guest House, Palakkad.

1805
02:16:45,466 --> 02:16:46,366
Move, please.

1806
02:16:46,968 --> 02:16:47,928
Move! Make way.

1807
02:17:11,259 --> 02:17:13,309
Hail Ramanunni!

1808
02:17:19,667 --> 02:17:20,977
Our dearest Ramanunni!

1809
02:17:26,707 --> 02:17:28,457
Independent Candidate
Adv. Ramanunni.

1810
02:17:29,176 --> 02:17:31,956
Things are so complicated that we
cannot say who is in Ayikkara's heart.

1811
02:17:32,780 --> 02:17:35,390
The workers of both fronts
and Columbian Club members,

1812
02:17:36,017 --> 02:17:38,067
are extremely excited and hopeful.

1813
02:17:38,486 --> 02:17:41,946
We can't say now if CDP which Ramanunni
left, will try to safeguard their position,

1814
02:17:42,523 --> 02:17:45,623
or whether NSP would try to
win back the seat they lost.

1815
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:48,000
Ayikkara, to the
polling booth today.

1816
02:17:48,362 --> 02:17:49,942
After detailed
political discussions,

1817
02:17:50,298 --> 02:17:51,528
the awakened minds of Ayikkara,

1818
02:17:55,970 --> 02:17:59,720
Various polling booths have been
experiencing huge rush since morning.

1819
02:18:00,508 --> 02:18:04,518
The election commission has arranged
tight security at the polling booths.

1820
02:18:05,212 --> 02:18:06,502
Ignoring the ailments of age,

1821
02:18:06,747 --> 02:18:08,767
to register their votes...

1822
02:18:09,250 --> 02:18:11,360
In the by-election at
Ayikkara constituency,

1823
02:18:11,719 --> 02:18:13,939
Independent Candidate,
Advocate KR Ramanunni,

1824
02:18:14,388 --> 02:18:19,898
has won by 11,891 votes against his
opposite candidate, CDP's Ragini Raghavan.

1825
02:18:20,728 --> 02:18:24,648
The total number of votes counted
- 156,913.

1826
02:18:26,067 --> 02:18:27,967
Mainstream political parties"

1827
02:18:28,369 --> 02:18:31,239
Ramanunni who was an MLA of
CDP, was expelled from the party,

1828
02:18:31,739 --> 02:18:33,729
and resigned his post
from the assembly;

1829
02:18:34,141 --> 02:18:36,801
following which a by-election
was announced in Ayikkara.

1830
02:18:37,712 --> 02:18:42,432
In the first round, Nallippadi Panchayat
gave Ramanunni a lead of 1416 votes.

1831
02:18:43,184 --> 02:18:45,084
A historical and
unexpected turn of events!

1832
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:48,679
Advocate Ramanunni has swept the
Ayikkara Assembly By-Election.

1833
02:18:49,423 --> 02:18:52,053
Along with proving his innocence,
in the Mohanan murder;

1834
02:18:52,526 --> 02:18:55,626
the ex-MLA was in hiding
for the last few days.

1835
02:18:56,430 --> 02:18:58,330
Being the prime suspect
of the said case,

1836
02:18:59,100 --> 02:19:02,200
the irony here is that he
vindicated himself unknowingly,

1837
02:19:03,037 --> 02:19:05,697
with the help of a hide and shoot programme
- Hot Pursuit.

1838
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:10,860
This can certainly be considered as a
massive breakthrough, in modern politics.

1839
02:19:17,151 --> 02:19:19,111
Your friend Ajayan doesn't
have any doubt, right?

1840
02:19:19,487 --> 02:19:20,337
No.

1841
02:19:20,554 --> 02:19:22,694
Even if we had told him, there
wouldn't be any problem. - No!

1842
02:19:32,099 --> 02:19:34,059
How I won without the
support of any party?

1843
02:19:40,374 --> 02:19:42,124
Hey! Don't be formal!

1844
02:19:43,544 --> 02:19:45,214
Should everything
be formal, Helena?

1845
02:19:46,781 --> 02:19:47,631
Live with me.

1846
02:19:54,288 --> 02:19:55,488
In your dreams!

1847
02:19:58,192 --> 02:19:59,802
You better live with me.

1848
02:20:00,428 --> 02:20:03,678
In this world, only you know
that I was also part of this game.

1849
02:20:05,032 --> 02:20:06,522
If I let you go, it's
a huge risk, dear.

1850
02:20:07,034 --> 02:20:08,734
Such a huge punishment
for helping you out?

1851
02:20:13,307 --> 02:20:15,147
I'll see to it that you
don't part ways with me!

1852
02:20:16,377 --> 02:20:17,927
It's my necessity, right?

1853
02:20:24,285 --> 02:20:26,155
That's a reason to have
a drink in the morning.

1854
02:20:55,616 --> 02:20:56,986
Oh my God!

1855
02:21:06,093 --> 02:21:07,733
Unnimara.. I mean, Ramanunni!

1856
02:21:09,163 --> 02:21:10,013
What is all this?

1857
02:21:12,366 --> 02:21:15,116
She secretly shot everything
that we did here & sent it on air.

1858
02:21:17,104 --> 02:21:17,954
And what?

1859
02:21:19,707 --> 02:21:21,167
The people made me
win the election.

1860
02:21:31,151 --> 02:21:32,001
Of course!

1861
02:21:33,621 --> 02:21:34,471
Keep it up!

1862
02:21:48,736 --> 02:21:52,196
Long Live Ramanunni!

1863
02:21:57,611 --> 02:21:59,751
Do you claim that voters
have proved their allegiance?

1864
02:22:00,147 --> 02:22:01,487
Which front have you
decided to join hereafter?

1865
02:22:02,016 --> 02:22:03,096
I'll explain everything in detail.

1866
02:22:03,350 --> 02:22:05,280
Anyway, the truth was proved.
That itself is a great fortune.

1867
02:22:10,257 --> 02:22:13,247
That this 'Hot Pursuit' was doing a Hide
& Shoot and showing it to the people?

1868
02:22:14,595 --> 02:22:16,965
They themselves declared it after
the election results came out.

1869
02:22:17,631 --> 02:22:21,001
Anyway, me and TC are lucky
that things ended in a good way.

1870
02:22:21,569 --> 02:22:22,469
Right, TC?
- Yes.

1871
02:22:22,736 --> 02:22:24,906
Even though I got a TC
from NSP, I'm also happy.

1872
02:22:25,339 --> 02:22:26,569
I will be with Ramanunni hereafter.

1873
02:22:27,041 --> 02:22:28,771
Thanks, to the
people and the media.

1874
02:22:32,346 --> 02:22:33,216
Keep chanting!

1875
02:22:51,198 --> 02:22:52,048
Get lost!

1876
02:23:37,044 --> 02:23:37,944
It's .32, right?

1877
02:23:40,581 --> 02:23:41,431
Point 32.

1878
02:24:02,069 --> 02:24:04,379
A hide & shoot programme
based on political crimes.

1879
02:24:13,247 --> 02:24:17,027
A campaign has been fixed through the
ground margin during the half time break.

1880
02:24:19,019 --> 02:24:20,159
Chandran, it shouldn't falter.

1881
02:24:42,743 --> 02:24:44,733
Udayabhanu's name is not
there on the reservation chart.

1882
02:24:49,283 --> 02:24:50,803
If Udayabhanu's name
is not on the chart,

1883
02:27:56,236 --> 02:27:57,986
Do you feel like saying
'Red Salute', Comrade?

1884
02:28:00,307 --> 02:28:03,557
It was not just a cliched cinema-styled
revenge by the son for his father;

1885
02:28:08,015 --> 02:28:09,275
we don't need another Mohanan.

1886
02:28:11,184 --> 02:28:12,034
Annihilation!

1887
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:15,850
Because I believe in the
annihilation of people like him,
