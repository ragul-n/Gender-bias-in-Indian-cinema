1
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
"India" 1664

2
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:34,310
A piece of jewelry

3
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:40,864
"But there was someone who destroyed that heaven."

4
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:58,380
Remember, Tana

5
00:04:58,977 --> 00:05:06,056
The fighter "who makes his sword will double his confidence in his sword"

6
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,288
If you want to hit a sword then you
have to be as fast as electricity

7
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:18,845
If you want to climb a rock, go to the top

8
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:25,773
If you want to fight, fight like a strong sun

9
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:33,148
What are you doing now, Tana?

10
00:05:47,124 --> 00:05:48,727
you are very strong

11
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:58,112
There was bloodshed everywhere

12
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:00,835
Many were silent with fear

13
00:06:01,073 --> 00:06:05,525
But some of them were fighting bravely for freedom

14
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:08,315
- I will come too

15
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,665
Take care of your mother and sister

16
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:19,022
Killings and looting were everywhere

17
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:26,315
Anyone who cannot give us
anything should give his life

18
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,488
.. all with all their might

19
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:48,021
They were fighting

20
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:55,758
This war was not about power, but about courage

21
00:06:58,013 --> 00:07:03,639
A person who is not afraid of failure will triumph

22
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:12,199
My Father

23
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:14,812
My Father

24
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:17,705
My Father

25
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:27,081
My main strength is you, Tana

26
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,628
Every time they die and leave a fortune to their children

27
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:34,215
But I have a mission for you

28
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:36,501
To restore the freedom of this land

29
00:07:57,258 --> 00:07:58,400
good luck

30
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:02,851
My Father

31
00:08:04,392 --> 00:08:06,517
" <font color=" # FFE87C>seventeen years ago "

32
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:12,192
Destruction was widespread all over the
country, and despair was raging everywhere

33
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:19,200
Then a brave man ruled the mountains of India

34
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:24,565
His name was Maharaj (Chhatrapati Shivaji)

35
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:30,097
Shivaji was king and his power commanded him

36
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:35,716
Shivaji, with leaders such as Nurhan Beg,
was thinking of restoring the country

37
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:39,955
Among all his leaders, there were those
who loved him more than his right hand

38
00:08:40,273 --> 00:08:44,090
true man

39
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:47,045
Commander (Tanhaji Malusar)

40
00:08:52,148 --> 00:09:01,983
<font color=# FFE87C>Tanhaghi: The Unknown Warrior</font>

41
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:25,804
♪ The enemy will destroy the country and make it burnt ♪

42
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,414
♪ Let everyone see where they are ♪

43
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:40,517
♪ To arouse all national pride ♪

44
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:50,368
Born with confidence and hard training

45
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:55,751
He raised his people with his sword for the sake of the country's flag

46
00:12:56,164 --> 00:13:00,179
... and won 40 battles

47
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,727
The enemy in Delhi from these victories was
not pleased "with Delhi in the year 1664"

48
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:08,139
He was preparing for a bigger war

49
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:18,097
Perpetual "Mughal" may prevail

50
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:27,248
Mr. Rajagi, who is weaker than you in front
of you to claim ownership? What would you do?

51
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,470
It will be destroyed

52
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:35,637
A new war was about to begin

53
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:39,002
War between the two angels

54
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,780
Instead of singing

55
00:13:40,892 --> 00:13:48,352
He sat on the elephant and welcomed the war with an army of eighty thousand

56
00:13:49,483 --> 00:13:54,367
And neither side was of the same strength

57
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:58,196
"There was concern about the face of" Shivaji

58
00:14:00,403 --> 00:14:08,093
Ajay wanted to conquer a large part of the country

59
00:14:08,434 --> 00:14:12,179
Then Shivaji ruled those parts

60
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:15,346
So there was no other way but war

61
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:19,465
Keep us alive,

62
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:21,092
God remove the sadness from us

63
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:22,878
And we gave strength

64
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,806
Now you just let us know

65
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,592
The Marathi army is alive

66
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,537
Or it will be destroyed by these monsters

67
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:35,791
Shivaji was afraid and needed more power

68
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,997
He was under attack from both sides

69
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,664
- Can't say much, but for how long?

70
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,338
No matter how prepared we are

71
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:49,608
But we are weak against them

72
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,096
If we want to defeat the enemy

73
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:01,048
We do not accept failure

74
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,072
There is only one way

75
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,337
To make peace

76
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:11,381
Send someone to tell me I'm going to go ahead with myself

77
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:17,169
Going to the Mongols means digging your grave with your own hands

78
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:21,256
But Shivaji of people and his soldiers were
important to the castle "Burandar" June 11, 1665

79
00:15:26,538 --> 00:15:27,538
"Brother" Umrah Konkan

80
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:34,811
Brother I have bad news for you

81
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:41,890
His entire Shivaji government surrendered including here

82
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:46,767
The enemy took advantage of the situation

83
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,643
Shivaji Prison

84
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:54,302
And to get many benefits

85
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:02,801
They have started the crime again in the eyes of everyone

86
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:07,634
And the resumption of looting

87
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:09,476
What do you do?

88
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,476
We haven't delivered this temple yet?

89
00:16:13,134 --> 00:16:14,134
Then you see

90
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:19,936
It's finally time to give it to us so it's better than now

91
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:28,817
Your King Shivaji handed all his rule to our king

92
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:32,563
North will be here too

93
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,783
So let them end their prayers

94
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:43,283
Then this temple for you

95
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:47,322
I can only do you a favor

96
00:16:50,013 --> 00:16:52,521
- How dare you get out of here?

97
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:57,552
It does not matter if they give you a fuss

98
00:16:58,203 --> 00:17:01,171
If you make a mistake, we will shed your blood

99
00:17:02,457 --> 00:17:03,719
Calm down

100
00:17:11,245 --> 00:17:13,237
We commit to wholesale

101
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,134
It's very understanding

102
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:19,103
Then you should go

103
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:25,206
Take away all flags from now on...
here and now on every corner

104
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,396
The magnificent Mughal property will rise...

105
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:30,841
Long live the Mongolian verdict.

106
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,683
Congratulation

107
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,675
But we are happy with that

108
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,251
This will not last long

109
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,885
Whatch out

110
00:17:54,224 --> 00:17:55,224
Madam

111
00:17:55,731 --> 00:17:57,175
Don't wear shoes?

112
00:17:58,063 --> 00:18:00,088
The air is very hot and your feet are very cold

113
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:05,397
- His land may not burn

114
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:10,976
I will not wear shoes until our flag is raised again

115
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:15,910
"Umrah with our land, as I delivered my shoes to" Mughals

116
00:18:23,657 --> 00:18:26,450
God, we will wait for victory again

117
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:31,731
Four years later

118
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:33,267
Four years have passed

119
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:37,061
Today, in some areas, the Mughal flag was raised, the Rajad Fort

120
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:39,648
But everyone still has hope

121
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:45,640
On a clear day, King Shivaji managed
to escape from the Mongols and return

122
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:51,046
Then they brought him some news

123
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:55,244
Sir, I teach you

124
00:18:57,213 --> 00:19:01,673
As if you came with great concern

125
00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:03,443
The news is...

126
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:06,490
That of Delhi government

127
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:10,427
He still wants to control the entire country

128
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:16,410
An army of two thousand men was sent to command the rotor hall

129
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:19,348
Oedipan !?

130
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,419
His name is very famous

131
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,046
Thirty-three years

132
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:30,562
It is very dangerous and the world is very trusting

133
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,935
But the universe does not trust anyone, sir

134
00:19:36,229 --> 00:19:40,665
A few months ago, the king of Iran was in
Agra with his guests on the Yamuna Agra River

135
00:19:41,364 --> 00:19:44,832
And play in the world of human chess

136
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:47,570
Here is the king of the universe

137
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:51,189
This is a horse step

138
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:58,919
"I forgot the king's soldier," Pahlavi said

139
00:19:59,102 --> 00:20:00,657
Move your spine first

140
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:08,023
I'm here too

141
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:55,275
Let's take a serious step to destroy the soldier

142
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:56,426
The scientist was very happy with Audipan's
courage and made him part of the Royal Guard

143
00:21:56,871 --> 00:21:57,871
And one night

144
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:04,092
Red Fort Delhi

145
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,180
Sir

146
00:23:12,831 --> 00:23:15,188
Odeban brought me tomorrow

147
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:18,013
All he asked, sir

148
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:46,435
Why stand up

149
00:24:12,322 --> 00:24:15,758
I want to conquer all of India

150
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:17,479
... and I want to

151
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,758
The "Mughal" flag is raised throughout the lands

152
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:26,615
And I want my master... the mission of this great and precious work

153
00:24:27,345 --> 00:24:29,297
I get it for you...

154
00:24:31,365 --> 00:24:34,829
We also opened half of India so far

155
00:24:36,084 --> 00:24:40,321
We also control half the other half

156
00:24:46,137 --> 00:24:49,710
I am very happy for your dedication and loyalty

157
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,495
So it will make you my commander in command

158
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,948
On that day I became a leader

159
00:25:03,663 --> 00:25:06,694
This is not a devil

160
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:08,417
But it is nothing less than Satan

161
00:25:09,814 --> 00:25:15,179
And now the devil has poisonous force and snake

162
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:21,107
The power of Audipan!  Or his army of two thousand is not so important

163
00:25:21,449 --> 00:25:26,575
The important thing is that he has an important weapon

164
00:25:26,877 --> 00:25:30,782
The poisonous snake's name

165
00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:34,107
It could reach thousands of revolutions

166
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:39,583
Can destroy a city with one shot

167
00:25:40,377 --> 00:25:46,837
The larger and more resistant walls are also unable to withstand it

168
00:25:56,252 --> 00:25:59,831
If you can get here

169
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:04,791
The restoration of "India" may become a dream

170
00:26:07,506 --> 00:26:11,807
- You are talking about failure and telling the truth

171
00:26:11,902 --> 00:26:15,489
Before fighting we must learn from defeat

172
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:20,084
It is not easy as you think

173
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,315
I myself accept the leadership of this war

174
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:28,339
No, sir

175
00:26:29,426 --> 00:26:31,370
It is not a problem if thousands of soldiers die in this war

176
00:26:31,752 --> 00:26:34,045
But do not let the catastrophe be upon you, dear one thousand come to mind

177
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:36,173
There is another leader...

178
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:39,783
Who could have won this war...

179
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:45,521
"Commander" Tanhaji Malusere

180
00:26:46,283 --> 00:26:48,584
Infinite person

181
00:26:52,942 --> 00:26:54,703
But we cannot tell him now

182
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,450
Why don't we say, sir?

183
00:26:57,966 --> 00:27:01,394
At home where a girl will marry

184
00:27:02,077 --> 00:27:04,973
One should not speak of murder

185
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:11,084
For the first time in many years

186
00:27:12,077 --> 00:27:14,029
Happiness has come to her home

187
00:27:59,222 --> 00:28:03,118
"Everyone fled with fear."

188
00:28:03,126 --> 00:28:07,991
When I show my sword

189
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:23,035
Everything was one and a half and I believed in the Moon

190
00:28:28,823 --> 00:28:32,394
"We are all very brave men."

191
00:28:32,498 --> 00:28:36,132
From now on, we will celebrate every day

192
00:28:36,188 --> 00:28:45,053
"From today there is nothing wrong with reaching the" moon

193
00:29:23,855 --> 00:29:28,490
"There was smoke and darkness everywhere."

194
00:29:28,515 --> 00:29:31,475
"I gave him the light."

195
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:38,663
It gave us strength and blessings and restored happiness

196
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:45,512
All the blessings she gave us made us laugh

197
00:29:46,332 --> 00:29:53,974
Thank you for coming to my house.

198
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:57,392
"We are never afraid and" out of the way

199
00:29:57,417 --> 00:30:02,591
We accepted all this talk of the moon

200
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:12,024
"We are all very brave men."

201
00:30:12,031 --> 00:30:15,602
From now on, we will celebrate every day.

202
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:23,792
As of today there is nothing wrong with
"everything on our way to the" moon

203
00:31:38,507 --> 00:31:40,296
Are you missing my father?

204
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:42,796
Whenever I hold this sword in my hands

205
00:31:45,568 --> 00:31:48,091
I remember something...

206
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:50,069
He always said

207
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:54,750
Tania will get married very beautiful

208
00:31:57,528 --> 00:31:59,123
But the world did not give him a chance

209
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:03,020
With the sword you make your blood

210
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:08,321
So if you cry, they no longer believe in your strength

211
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:13,877
"I will win every war," Savitri said

212
00:32:15,711 --> 00:32:16,711
But in this war

213
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:19,996
I always lose

214
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:23,416
I will not let you lose

215
00:32:25,052 --> 00:32:27,996
We are holding a wonderful marriage, Raiba

216
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:31,901
Its convoy is very colorful...

217
00:32:32,687 --> 00:32:34,401
People only look

218
00:32:36,584 --> 00:32:40,401
My father will be happy wherever he is

219
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:41,948
What if I see one?

220
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:46,313
There is nothing wrong with "Parvati" at the foot of Shankar, the goddess

221
00:32:46,988 --> 00:32:49,543
But if I sat on the feet of my husband, there is nothing wrong with that

222
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:55,636
Amra, who will meet the couple a lot

223
00:32:57,456 --> 00:32:58,456
Yes, this

224
00:33:00,722 --> 00:33:04,634
But we only see each other's eyes when we see ourselves

225
00:33:07,238 --> 00:33:09,357
I want to see both of us together

226
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:15,372
We do not see each other in this small mirror

227
00:34:04,981 --> 00:34:07,116
He is coming now

228
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:10,854
I say beautiful lady and leader here too

229
00:34:11,378 --> 00:34:15,108
But I do not understand what her relationship with the leader is

230
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:19,505
I told you he is a demon

231
00:34:19,787 --> 00:34:22,354
But he seems to be interested in humans

232
00:34:23,885 --> 00:34:25,432
Wow the commander is watching

233
00:34:39,006 --> 00:34:40,831
How do I destroy it?

234
00:34:41,577 --> 00:34:43,418
You will definitely be ruined

235
00:34:44,696 --> 00:34:48,561
A widow raised from her husband's mourning

236
00:34:53,286 --> 00:34:55,897
What man commits this sin?

237
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:08,617
When he gets angry, he becomes red

238
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:13,156
But you will become whiter and thinner

239
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,489
like the moon

240
00:35:17,974 --> 00:35:20,236
God-fearing, adobeian

241
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:24,799
The fear of God raised my blood

242
00:35:29,218 --> 00:35:31,660
But this desire is also fulfilled with my blood

243
00:35:33,277 --> 00:35:35,268
And now he wants it

244
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:39,079
It goes on my body

245
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:50,578
wherever you are

246
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:54,075
I also

247
00:36:01,288 --> 00:36:03,518
I do not change my name either

248
00:36:04,815 --> 00:36:06,931
Because my name is also attractive to me

249
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:26,895
Shankariya Yes brother

250
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:30,300
Until I came back with Shivaji

251
00:36:30,673 --> 00:36:34,919
Until then your eyes and sword should be very careful

252
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:38,315
I now have protection here

253
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:45,612
Boy, yes

254
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,889
The sun is shining from above

255
00:36:48,096 --> 00:36:50,048
And you never end of your nap

256
00:36:52,453 --> 00:36:54,072
Shut up, let's go

257
00:37:03,525 --> 00:37:05,827
Shivajia "knows you a lot"

258
00:37:06,343 --> 00:37:09,406
Let me tell you the truth that today there is nothing against you

259
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:14,128
If you think there is strength

260
00:37:15,557 --> 00:37:19,922
"Shivaraj" ideas completely changed the country and history

261
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:23,287
I think you change history, too

262
00:37:25,002 --> 00:37:28,866
Another person is writing history, so this is it

263
00:37:30,713 --> 00:37:32,966
Who writes?  I write -

264
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:39,966
Come, brother

265
00:37:40,245 --> 00:37:42,871
It is too late for horses to get tired

266
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:44,569
Give me that brush

267
00:38:00,141 --> 00:38:01,125
Tania

268
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:05,879
At the "Ripa and Shivaji" wedding you must have the party

269
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:10,419
If Raja doesn't come, you won't come too, right?

270
00:38:10,816 --> 00:38:14,331
If I don't come, he will definitely come

271
00:38:54,344 --> 00:38:56,367
I'll take a break

272
00:38:56,971 --> 00:38:58,867
- Tell me, sir

273
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,072
Sir, I have news for you

274
00:39:14,056 --> 00:39:16,953
Audbian will arrive at the Dokan Gate

275
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,460
My father is great here

276
00:39:32,452 --> 00:39:36,697
Yes, Rajar, King of Marathas

277
00:39:38,214 --> 00:39:42,523
We have come blessings

278
00:39:42,658 --> 00:39:47,531
And if this does not work in vain with us

279
00:39:48,645 --> 00:39:50,224
Nobody returns to the village

280
00:39:50,249 --> 00:39:56,177
Ask your son Shivaji Marajaj whether he will come to our bride or not?

281
00:39:56,432 --> 00:39:57,836
To a thigh

282
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:02,838
- We did not find the time to bless you

283
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:05,362
"Yurja's wedding."

284
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:08,243
"Who are we to invite? Yes" Hitma -

285
00:40:08,701 --> 00:40:11,875
We will do the task first and then we will tell you

286
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,192
Can't we do anything?

287
00:40:19,478 --> 00:40:21,787
Why, sir?  Adeebhan soon will come

288
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,707
We heard that he would attack

289
00:40:27,922 --> 00:40:32,144
On the one hand, Bishkek Khan and his army, on the one hand, and Udayban

290
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:37,477
In the middle of the war with the two of us will be destroyed

291
00:40:37,986 --> 00:40:39,438
So what do we do?

292
00:40:41,676 --> 00:40:42,676
We have a way

293
00:40:44,494 --> 00:40:46,644
Of course Khan cannot harm us

294
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:49,398
Parents to fear Adeebhan

295
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:51,882
His Excellency the Sultan

296
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:54,453
Commander Tania arrived

297
00:40:58,113 --> 00:41:00,088
She must have come to call me

298
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,359
be cerfull

299
00:41:03,192 --> 00:41:05,049
Tania should not have knowledge

300
00:41:23,632 --> 00:41:26,123
As our time progressed

301
00:41:26,981 --> 00:41:30,234
You too will be broken

302
00:41:31,306 --> 00:41:34,909
If India's hope is good for you then it will be

303
00:41:49,365 --> 00:41:50,365
Shivram

304
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,281
Are you okay? Yes, Your Excellency

305
00:42:17,824 --> 00:42:20,824
Wow, we should come to you

306
00:42:21,388 --> 00:42:25,244
Born at home

307
00:42:25,454 --> 00:42:28,189
How can a mother expect more from this?

308
00:42:28,956 --> 00:42:32,741
Shiva said that she will be out of the woods with milk

309
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:34,918
But I feel

310
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,125
That your son is back in this house

311
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,502
Get this to complete the ceremony

312
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:47,599
With the whole family

313
00:42:48,758 --> 00:42:50,956
Bring him on

314
00:43:02,197 --> 00:43:04,919
How is the wedding?  - Great

315
00:43:06,142 --> 00:43:10,276
In fact, the most important of all is the prayer ceremony

316
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,784
Waiting for this day?  Heavily -

317
00:43:13,888 --> 00:43:15,903
The first time you come

318
00:43:21,086 --> 00:43:23,998
You are preparing for war

319
00:43:25,693 --> 00:43:26,693
Not

320
00:43:31,815 --> 00:43:32,815
“Remember,” Raja said

321
00:43:33,696 --> 00:43:38,974
We fought together a few years ago

322
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:40,897
I said it

323
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:46,262
He is brave enough to risk his life to save someone else

324
00:43:54,734 --> 00:43:58,202
Now in every struggle I am in front of you

325
00:44:01,716 --> 00:44:02,716
brother

326
00:44:03,854 --> 00:44:07,925
Your leader, our eyes are clear, welcome

327
00:44:08,822 --> 00:44:10,552
Greetings to my master

328
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:18,504
Crushing the tree trunk and breaking the enemy's head are very different things

329
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:19,789
brother

330
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:23,876
Everyone should be as brave as they can speak

331
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,487
I am not just talking

332
00:44:27,012 --> 00:44:29,289
When it is time to show my strength and my courage

333
00:44:29,504 --> 00:44:33,289
If His Holiness allowed the body to soften the synaptic

334
00:45:23,936 --> 00:45:25,734
It is not bad to exercise a little

335
00:45:36,022 --> 00:45:38,903
Tell me how it was

336
00:45:50,841 --> 00:45:51,841
Don't want to finish?

337
00:45:59,172 --> 00:46:00,172
I say that

338
00:46:01,644 --> 00:46:03,786
Go and tell Tangy everything

339
00:46:05,335 --> 00:46:08,239
Tell him that His Holiness hides something about you

340
00:46:10,596 --> 00:46:14,556
It will fall between sugar, Raja and Tanagaji

341
00:46:17,787 --> 00:46:19,405
And what if you become one?

342
00:46:20,482 --> 00:46:23,278
Tangh, you will definitely win a chicken.

343
00:46:24,378 --> 00:46:26,013
But he will not return

344
00:46:29,831 --> 00:46:34,751
And what if "Raja" understands that I told him that?

345
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,119
good

346
00:46:36,886 --> 00:46:38,275
Say it was necessary

347
00:46:40,894 --> 00:46:45,409
Say that "Thanhaji" has threatened you

348
00:46:46,528 --> 00:46:50,868
His holiness will hold you back

349
00:46:52,202 --> 00:46:54,543
He will reward you

350
00:46:56,112 --> 00:47:01,032
It was as if you were in politics first and then you got stuck

351
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:09,579
You have a good brain

352
00:47:09,728 --> 00:47:10,728
Hit her anymore

353
00:47:13,485 --> 00:47:14,485
Come

354
00:47:14,669 --> 00:47:17,541
Hello captain, please

355
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,224
Your store looks good

356
00:47:23,725 --> 00:47:25,360
I want two faces

357
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,400
we see each other

358
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,963
So take this, sir

359
00:47:37,842 --> 00:47:38,842
you too

360
00:47:39,621 --> 00:47:42,850
- I was looking for you

361
00:47:43,353 --> 00:47:46,041
I don't know why you're looking for me

362
00:47:46,984 --> 00:47:48,653
There is one important issue

363
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:52,828
I get it

364
00:48:08,124 --> 00:48:09,124
Forgive me, sir

365
00:48:12,249 --> 00:48:15,280
I couldn't come to welcome you

366
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:20,383
Are you ready?

367
00:48:21,327 --> 00:48:22,700
Yes I got involved

368
00:48:23,253 --> 00:48:24,253
What is a conflict?

369
00:48:24,891 --> 00:48:26,574
You explain to them

370
00:48:27,384 --> 00:48:29,701
They reject my words

371
00:48:34,796 --> 00:48:35,796
What was this, sir?

372
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:39,884
When I threw a cane, you put your right hand forward

373
00:48:41,511 --> 00:48:42,511
Not your chest

374
00:48:43,598 --> 00:48:48,232
When a threat comes in, you should not always protect your chest and move forward

375
00:48:48,574 --> 00:48:50,470
You have to send your right hand forward

376
00:48:51,852 --> 00:48:55,089
But this time I can't say the right thing

377
00:48:55,297 --> 00:48:56,297
Why can't you?

378
00:48:56,574 --> 00:48:58,899
Because her daughter's wedding

379
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:02,954
Is her daughter's wedding more important than this city?

380
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:07,249
Is her daughter's wedding more important to the life and life of Marathians?

381
00:49:07,765 --> 00:49:14,987
Is it very important for her daughter's wedding that the
king lie to her boss and her boyfriend's girlfriend?

382
00:49:15,623 --> 00:49:17,599
Is her bride so important?

383
00:49:18,028 --> 00:49:23,663
Are you going to sacrifice yourself?

384
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:28,629
And give them all the sadness and let them win?

385
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:33,081
I'm going to destroy it

386
00:49:36,169 --> 00:49:37,169
Tania

387
00:49:46,638 --> 00:49:47,638
Today

388
00:49:48,146 --> 00:49:52,915
My job is to restore happiness to you

389
00:49:57,323 --> 00:50:02,098
For me these tears are very valuable

390
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,614
When these tears flow my blood boils

391
00:50:10,358 --> 00:50:14,032
He gave you a walk

392
00:50:16,905 --> 00:50:17,905
Not Tania

393
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:28,143
- Please understand your son, madam

394
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:31,548
You are my son too

395
00:50:36,674 --> 00:50:38,816
Your son when he wants to do something

396
00:50:39,887 --> 00:50:42,308
This is an opportunity to be touched upon

397
00:50:51,733 --> 00:50:55,042
May Allah give us strength

398
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:08,816
Upload banners and tell everyone

399
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:12,752
First we go to enemy war and then we celebrate

400
00:51:30,269 --> 00:51:32,244
We have two ways

401
00:51:33,149 --> 00:51:34,149
attack

402
00:51:34,578 --> 00:51:36,760
Or wait for his army

403
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:40,903
My master always tells you that

404
00:51:41,737 --> 00:51:43,339
It was intended that their strength be weak

405
00:51:45,165 --> 00:51:46,165
We will attack

406
00:51:46,493 --> 00:51:48,823
We should go there

407
00:51:52,991 --> 00:51:56,173
We have four ways to get there, sir

408
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,633
The former will pass through Sharnbad

409
00:52:00,687 --> 00:52:01,687
battlefield

410
00:52:02,697 --> 00:52:04,546
Adeebhan does not take risks

411
00:52:05,308 --> 00:52:06,895
The second is Kollamare Road

412
00:52:07,364 --> 00:52:09,188
Directly from Aurangabad to Pune

413
00:52:13,999 --> 00:52:14,999
Without a word

414
00:52:17,158 --> 00:52:18,459
He will not go away

415
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:23,721
The third way across the country is to get to Pune

416
00:52:23,793 --> 00:52:25,681
The longest way

417
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,808
not like that

418
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:31,610
And the fourth way, sir

419
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,690
The shortest path

420
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:37,309
From the mountains

421
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:40,944
The simplest saw

422
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:44,466
In what way are we going, sir?

423
00:52:53,053 --> 00:52:54,197
We are going from Sherdon

424
00:52:54,631 --> 00:52:55,631
Sherdon

425
00:52:56,229 --> 00:53:00,435
Sherdon, Audban comes from Sherdon

426
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:06,007
We hope to get them in Sherdon

427
00:53:07,562 --> 00:53:09,618
And defeat them

428
00:53:23,134 --> 00:53:26,888
I want to give you something

429
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:29,142
- completing the mission

430
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:31,412
And your life is in danger too

431
00:53:32,198 --> 00:53:36,412
Before Tana arrives in Sherdon, you must reach Udban

432
00:53:37,531 --> 00:53:40,777
data?  Tell me I am with him

433
00:53:42,212 --> 00:53:45,029
Just take over, Shivaji

434
00:53:45,313 --> 00:53:47,124
I will always serve him

435
00:53:48,646 --> 00:53:49,646
Yes sir

436
00:53:51,678 --> 00:53:53,780
Yehia Mahadeo

437
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:57,290
"Long live," Mahadeo said

438
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:00,111
healthy

439
00:54:02,484 --> 00:54:03,484
listen now

440
00:54:05,222 --> 00:54:06,222
listen now

441
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:10,214
what happened?  We have been here for three days

442
00:54:11,238 --> 00:54:12,793
We will not move forward

443
00:54:13,595 --> 00:54:17,071
And the leader watches that woman all day and night

444
00:54:17,206 --> 00:54:20,682
- Who is this woman again?

445
00:54:21,984 --> 00:54:24,237
You did not understand anything

446
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,555
To be honest, first love is very devastating

447
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:34,073
Yes that's right

448
00:54:35,129 --> 00:54:37,668
But today it seems silly

449
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:55,580
Sir

450
00:55:06,141 --> 00:55:07,141
Sir

451
00:55:07,363 --> 00:55:08,363
What is the matter?

452
00:55:08,732 --> 00:55:10,883
One of the "bons" here

453
00:55:27,214 --> 00:55:28,649
Dear Adopan

454
00:55:29,224 --> 00:55:30,224
who are you?

455
00:55:31,649 --> 00:55:32,848
Resignation letter?

456
00:55:34,052 --> 00:55:37,059
- Yes, a small speech

457
00:55:42,223 --> 00:55:44,890
This is for you, Jagat Singh

458
00:55:51,172 --> 00:55:54,561
The message came from Chandra Singh

459
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:57,125
To tell the story

460
00:55:58,696 --> 00:56:02,680
From the leader “Marathi” means that “Tanhaji” will go to the Sherdon Mountains

461
00:56:05,053 --> 00:56:06,973
To attack you

462
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:11,667
I hope my friendship with you will be permanent

463
00:56:16,412 --> 00:56:18,465
Why did you send me this news?

464
00:56:19,569 --> 00:56:21,227
For friendship

465
00:56:21,937 --> 00:56:25,179
With your friendship with Chandra Singh, you form your government sooner

466
00:56:25,283 --> 00:56:28,632
You have to befriend your enemy's enemy anyway

467
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:32,600
Who is the enemy?  Tanhajee Malusere -

468
00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:34,282
Who is the friend?

469
00:56:36,176 --> 00:56:37,176
Sir

470
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:40,056
You are a revolving "Audipan"

471
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,874
Few of our news

472
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:04,390
If the news is one of your news, I will be your permanent friend

473
00:57:08,196 --> 00:57:09,949
And if you are not one

474
00:57:11,354 --> 00:57:15,735
I am leaving this world

475
00:57:33,426 --> 00:57:36,536
Sir, in the Sherdon Mountains, my approach

476
00:57:36,727 --> 00:57:39,124
Waiting for his forces

477
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:44,749
I told

478
00:57:49,657 --> 00:57:51,173
If so

479
00:57:51,848 --> 00:57:55,204
I receive our friend

480
00:58:07,849 --> 00:58:10,999
Be a little more careful

481
00:58:11,182 --> 00:58:13,284
Don't miss it too much

482
00:58:13,649 --> 00:58:17,696
- I'm not joking

483
00:58:18,768 --> 00:58:21,577
With this army he will not leave the area alive

484
00:58:23,649 --> 00:58:24,649
There will be a massacre

485
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:51,002
Where do they want to go?

486
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,606
The detective said that they would understand

487
00:58:56,053 --> 00:58:57,703
From there they go

488
00:59:02,741 --> 00:59:04,155
Vacationers

489
00:59:08,369 --> 00:59:09,369
Yes sir

490
00:59:09,853 --> 00:59:12,186
Let's prepare the army, sir?

491
00:59:12,837 --> 00:59:15,320
From now on the army must always be ready

492
00:59:16,162 --> 00:59:17,162
But sir

493
00:59:18,551 --> 00:59:20,098
How do we go?

494
00:59:22,487 --> 00:59:23,868
We are going from Sherdon

495
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:48,921
Look

496
01:00:01,804 --> 01:00:05,147
The leader, they are in between but seem very low

497
01:01:33,793 --> 01:01:34,793
Leader

498
01:01:35,952 --> 01:01:38,967
We are all marathons

499
01:02:45,318 --> 01:02:48,792
What do you think of Mr. Adiban

500
01:02:50,627 --> 01:02:54,404
Tears were thrown from the eyes of your enemy

501
01:02:56,276 --> 01:02:59,808
Until now, Tanagee must be sad

502
01:03:48,886 --> 01:03:50,806
Everyone jerk

503
01:03:51,664 --> 01:03:53,988
The important thing is how to respond to this trick

504
01:03:57,444 --> 01:03:58,444
Take your sword

505
01:03:59,148 --> 01:04:01,734
Our soul is still good

506
01:04:03,021 --> 01:04:04,925
Tania returns to the beginning

507
01:04:05,537 --> 01:04:09,417
Tighten your steps again and try again

508
01:04:11,767 --> 01:04:12,767
brother

509
01:04:13,318 --> 01:04:16,518
Let's go to Cougar now, not Syria

510
01:04:17,669 --> 01:04:21,692
You are back to Roger

511
01:04:22,812 --> 01:04:24,502
And watch out for everything

512
01:04:26,168 --> 01:04:27,168
And where are you going?

513
01:04:28,256 --> 01:04:31,350
I'm going to answer this trick

514
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:36,130
But they go

515
01:04:36,948 --> 01:04:39,845
Odeban will see him Tania

516
01:04:40,401 --> 01:04:45,646
It's time for Audipan to die and nothing to worry about

517
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,123
In Dukan v. Marathas

518
01:05:33,187 --> 01:05:36,441
This is the first victory that I am saying, Udban

519
01:05:36,888 --> 01:05:37,888
Congratulation

520
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:44,189
Congratulation

521
01:05:44,301 --> 01:05:51,745
Pete Khan sent a letter to King Bresson stating that
the poisonous snake had reached its destination

522
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,415
And his rule grew

523
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:01,780
Turn it over

524
01:06:03,455 --> 01:06:06,264
Take the mark

525
01:06:17,161 --> 01:06:18,161
But sir

526
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:21,225
We are waiting for the king's order

527
01:06:23,785 --> 01:06:26,157
Think about it once

528
01:06:56,874 --> 01:06:59,318
We want a better victory

529
01:07:01,118 --> 01:07:03,397
Sir, there is news about Deccan

530
01:07:05,696 --> 01:07:07,722
"Adobean" arrived there

531
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:13,476
Now, no one can stop you from conquering all of India

532
01:07:23,442 --> 01:07:24,759
Think

533
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:31,299
There is a way to die and pressure death on you

534
01:07:31,775 --> 01:07:36,188
And your problem is so big that no one can explain it to you

535
01:07:37,696 --> 01:07:41,307
They make fun of all of you

536
01:07:44,855 --> 01:07:50,196
Come on, do not look at the enemy who is looking at you

537
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:53,235
So I looked for you and followed you

538
01:07:58,732 --> 01:08:00,747
I have said this for years

539
01:08:01,789 --> 01:08:03,908
No matter how serious the problem is

540
01:08:06,496 --> 01:08:08,614
There is definitely a way

541
01:08:09,902 --> 01:08:11,082
Everything has a way

542
01:08:11,511 --> 01:08:13,940
This has a price

543
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,646
And now they should be tired

544
01:08:20,099 --> 01:08:22,543
Where does this road go

545
01:08:24,504 --> 01:08:25,504
nobody knows

546
01:08:26,305 --> 01:08:29,852
Years have passed but there was no one

547
01:08:31,567 --> 01:08:32,567
listen now

548
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:38,868
There is a way for your weapon... at home

549
01:08:40,106 --> 01:08:42,241
One in secret...

550
01:08:44,622 --> 01:08:47,661
What a pain you can't get there

551
01:08:51,027 --> 01:08:55,264
Why are you risking your life?

552
01:08:58,074 --> 01:09:04,241
Dad I have God's help so why am I concerned about myself

553
01:09:05,368 --> 01:09:06,368
you are right

554
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:09,970
I'm blind

555
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:14,677
But I also want to see freedom

556
01:09:16,689 --> 01:09:18,840
Come to eat

557
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:26,959
There is one person who can help

558
01:09:28,421 --> 01:09:29,421
From?

559
01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:35,094
"The Mughal of Martha, Admiral" Serenik

560
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:43,361
Sirink, is that you?

561
01:09:43,494 --> 01:09:44,494
Yes sir

562
01:09:45,403 --> 01:09:48,784
Sorry for the error last night

563
01:09:51,102 --> 01:09:52,102
What happened last night?

564
01:09:52,578 --> 01:09:54,791
He forgot the answer

565
01:09:55,808 --> 01:09:58,831
We always told her to stay awake

566
01:10:00,054 --> 01:10:02,958
He had to answer that I was on the alert

567
01:10:03,998 --> 01:10:05,593
But he did not say anything

568
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:09,292
Sir, there were a few wild "pigs" going through me last night

569
01:10:10,102 --> 01:10:12,332
If I shout, it will attack me

570
01:10:24,437 --> 01:10:28,135
Was there a wild "pig" last night?  Yes sir

571
01:10:28,707 --> 01:10:31,294
Until today the milk stopped

572
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:34,278
Say no more

573
01:10:35,374 --> 01:10:37,302
Stay awake

574
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:40,405
Tell me to hurry

575
01:10:41,016 --> 01:10:45,072
Stay awake Tell me I'm awake

576
01:10:47,017 --> 01:10:49,437
Stay awake

577
01:10:59,508 --> 01:11:01,302
He didn't say that

578
01:11:08,084 --> 01:11:10,479
Adobein "didn't make a mistake"

579
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:13,051
He is only punished

580
01:11:16,155 --> 01:11:19,147
Always remember this

581
01:11:22,338 --> 01:11:25,290
We have time to go

582
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,240
Satya

583
01:11:33,396 --> 01:11:34,396
Anything happened

584
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:39,356
You do not tell anyone what happened here, sir

585
01:11:42,793 --> 01:11:47,117
Search "Nick" in the woods but I didn't find the tiles

586
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,497
Like wild animals

587
01:12:13,425 --> 01:12:14,425
Get to know him first

588
01:12:16,069 --> 01:12:17,069
who is this

589
01:12:17,543 --> 01:12:19,988
This is a corpse

590
01:12:25,003 --> 01:12:28,400
She told me several times not to break the wall

591
01:12:30,884 --> 01:12:31,884
But then again

592
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:35,892
Nick has serious consequences

593
01:12:36,646 --> 01:12:39,550
Why you are not saying the truth?  - what truth?

594
01:12:40,464 --> 01:12:42,479
These poor people last night

595
01:12:43,249 --> 01:12:46,130
Only once he forgot to say that he was on alert

596
01:12:46,448 --> 01:12:49,297
How did you know that?  A living person can lie -

597
01:12:51,803 --> 01:12:52,803
But not dead

598
01:12:57,017 --> 01:13:00,056
What does Nick say?

599
01:13:01,644 --> 01:13:02,644
It is true

600
01:13:03,619 --> 01:13:08,413
But what can we do besides silence against Adobe?

601
01:13:08,795 --> 01:13:09,795
What I've done so far

602
01:13:11,914 --> 01:13:12,914
betrayal

603
01:13:14,884 --> 01:13:17,669
I betrayed your land

604
01:13:18,201 --> 01:13:20,518
Betraying your enemy now, why should we?

605
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:23,922
Whose?  - For Yorav's sake

606
01:13:23,947 --> 01:13:28,526
For your private life and for your secret

607
01:13:29,322 --> 01:13:30,573
That Shivaji?

608
01:13:31,098 --> 01:13:34,931
The person who did not think about this upon surrender

609
01:13:35,876 --> 01:13:38,621
What would have happened to us -

610
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:44,613
We need your help to defeat this enemy

611
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:50,867
He has come here again and wants to kill us all

612
01:13:51,081 --> 01:13:54,597
Yet you live in shame for the rest of your life

613
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:58,803
You can no longer leave your home on a clear day

614
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:02,389
They steal you from everything before your eyes

615
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:07,140
They take everything from you and you are the most important

616
01:14:07,165 --> 01:14:10,682
Long live and says you can not do anything else

617
01:14:11,502 --> 01:14:13,248
How much more do you want to kill?

618
01:14:17,694 --> 01:14:25,574
The universe will open and Adian will kill someone like a court

619
01:14:25,599 --> 01:14:33,418
We have to say every night and stay up and alert

620
01:14:33,426 --> 01:14:35,298
Do you want this?

621
01:14:47,471 --> 01:14:52,994
Turn the tile until there is a feeling of revenge inside you

622
01:14:54,169 --> 01:14:55,280
But she can not count on you

623
01:14:56,871 --> 01:14:57,871
Stop

624
01:14:58,257 --> 01:15:00,026
Who are you at all

625
01:15:02,284 --> 01:15:03,284
fighter

626
01:15:04,332 --> 01:15:05,332
My name is

627
01:15:06,459 --> 01:15:08,982
"Commander", Tenji Mauser

628
01:15:21,096 --> 01:15:23,841
From today we will do what you say

629
01:15:24,364 --> 01:15:28,491
I want to see them before defeating the enemy

630
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:30,314
We should see them

631
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:35,568
So tomorrow we have a party on the hill

632
01:16:15,553 --> 01:16:20,235
Shankar, Shankar.

633
01:16:23,832 --> 01:16:28,638
"Hold her tail."

634
01:16:28,663 --> 01:16:31,932
Shankar, Shankar.

635
01:16:32,615 --> 01:16:36,829
"There's always a fire going on in my chest."

636
01:16:36,854 --> 01:16:41,409
"There's always a fire going on in my chest."

637
01:16:58,743 --> 01:17:01,195
"My behavior is great."

638
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:03,163
"My mind is too high."

639
01:17:03,188 --> 01:17:05,172
"My dance is like a sharp sword."

640
01:17:05,197 --> 01:17:07,704
"And most of all"

641
01:17:20,591 --> 01:17:22,828
"I got good things from everyone."

642
01:17:22,853 --> 01:17:25,027
"This is my word everywhere."

643
01:17:25,052 --> 01:17:29,678
"I have every place."

644
01:17:31,155 --> 01:17:36,472
"Hold her tail."

645
01:17:50,831 --> 01:17:58,759
"She dances and makes everyone dance."

646
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:07,976
"She dances and makes everyone dance."

647
01:18:08,193 --> 01:18:12,907
"God is always behind me."

648
01:18:12,932 --> 01:18:17,209
"There is a lot of strength and strength in my legs"

649
01:18:17,837 --> 01:18:21,820
"I will remove any obstacle on my way"

650
01:18:21,845 --> 01:18:25,720
"Hold her tail."

651
01:18:26,459 --> 01:18:34,307
Shankar, Shankar.

652
01:18:34,858 --> 01:18:38,945
"There's always a fire going on in my chest."

653
01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:43,265
"There's always a fire going on in my chest."

654
01:18:52,659 --> 01:19:01,433
"God forbid"

655
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:07,791
"God forbid"

656
01:19:07,816 --> 01:19:15,846
"God forbid"

657
01:19:21,565 --> 01:19:22,565
Why did you kill him?

658
01:19:22,843 --> 01:19:26,343
Everywhere in the world, the penalty for treachery is only one game

659
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:30,050
who are you?

660
01:19:34,692 --> 01:19:35,692
Tania

661
01:19:44,457 --> 01:19:46,361
Yes sir

662
01:19:46,386 --> 01:19:49,338
Arrest them with great respect

663
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:21,193
Behind them, there is a secret path with a secret door

664
01:20:25,896 --> 01:20:27,824
Like she's so scared

665
01:20:32,118 --> 01:20:36,768
If you had asked me about it before
you came, the bowl wouldn't dare come

666
01:20:40,443 --> 01:20:45,752
If someone stops you and tells you, I am not afraid of you

667
01:20:46,387 --> 01:20:52,228
So either Devonis or Marathi

668
01:20:56,376 --> 01:20:57,738
You mean you're crazy?

669
01:20:58,873 --> 01:21:04,896
Crazy King Martha is the King, the Territory and God

670
01:21:09,498 --> 01:21:12,260
Soil and kingdom are for conquest

671
01:21:14,014 --> 01:21:18,212
Don't be optimistic about what this person can do -

672
01:21:19,204 --> 01:21:23,537
One calls heaven twice a day

673
01:21:24,403 --> 01:21:26,371
before the sun rise

674
01:21:27,396 --> 01:21:30,309
After sunset

675
01:21:32,412 --> 01:21:34,943
... my upbringing is linked to emotions

676
01:21:36,126 --> 01:21:38,189
He caused me water...

677
01:21:39,805 --> 01:21:44,487
You can give it to me but I can take it

678
01:21:46,132 --> 01:21:47,322
Then again

679
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:51,235
I can throw you in the ground

680
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:55,259
The truth is that everyone returns to their lands

681
01:21:57,989 --> 01:22:02,338
But think about it if this soil brings you back

682
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:05,123
What happens to your body?

683
01:22:19,575 --> 01:22:20,575
Unfortunate Vipan

684
01:22:22,493 --> 01:22:25,707
This right hand is what you want to kill

685
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:30,096
If Tanhaji is here, Shivaji will definitely come here

686
01:22:30,326 --> 01:22:33,064
My sword has just come out of Jugat Singh

687
01:22:33,763 --> 01:22:38,016
And my bloodstained prayers

688
01:22:39,937 --> 01:22:42,485
Now I'm not someone else

689
01:22:48,857 --> 01:22:53,326
With this card you wanted to kill your enemy

690
01:23:05,558 --> 01:23:06,991
You're right

691
01:23:07,698 --> 01:23:09,960
The traitor is just one punishment

692
01:23:11,213 --> 01:23:12,213
the death

693
01:23:14,444 --> 01:23:16,666
We are both waiting now

694
01:23:19,038 --> 01:23:20,301
You are waiting for death

695
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:27,883
I'm waiting, Shivaji

696
01:24:05,461 --> 01:24:07,309
The more strength you get, the less pain you get

697
01:24:35,413 --> 01:24:37,302
They asked for my help

698
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:40,953
For my sister

699
01:24:42,048 --> 01:24:43,048
Perfect for her

700
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,405
We lived in a village

701
01:24:50,064 --> 01:24:51,754
"The village was named" Vidipur

702
01:24:54,024 --> 01:24:56,746
Udban was our guardian

703
01:24:57,691 --> 01:25:00,953
All the children of the royal family were playing together

704
01:25:01,382 --> 01:25:02,865
And one day

705
01:25:03,437 --> 01:25:05,929
The prince was asked to attend a wedding

706
01:25:06,596 --> 01:25:09,564
Udban told him that I love you

707
01:25:12,192 --> 01:25:13,850
are you kidding?

708
01:25:14,676 --> 01:25:16,358
My love is no joke

709
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:22,707
But I have no interest

710
01:25:24,606 --> 01:25:25,606
but why?

711
01:25:29,154 --> 01:25:31,571
In marriage, the two parties must be equal

712
01:25:32,285 --> 01:25:33,864
As for I'm missing

713
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:40,586
I am not the only one... because you are a prince and I am just a princess

714
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,690
If only this would be fine

715
01:25:44,204 --> 01:25:45,204
So what's the problem?

716
01:25:46,031 --> 01:25:47,928
The issue of adoption

717
01:25:48,984 --> 01:25:53,563
You are definitely the guardian but your mother

718
01:26:05,588 --> 01:26:10,424
He got out of there and no one knew where he was going

719
01:26:10,830 --> 01:26:13,718
And she married the prince

720
01:26:14,441 --> 01:26:16,988
Then one day Audipian returned with the Mongols

721
01:26:17,822 --> 01:26:19,512
He attacked the village

722
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:22,734
The Mongols "kill the ideal husband"

723
01:26:23,552 --> 01:26:27,186
Bring the widow's widow fully with her

724
01:26:28,004 --> 01:26:30,432
And you became friends with her to save your sister

725
01:26:35,075 --> 01:26:37,099
... this is so bewildering promise

726
01:26:38,322 --> 01:26:42,583
If our target is different but our enemy is the same

727
01:26:43,877 --> 01:26:48,297
From now on, I will not sword in any marathon

728
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:55,687
You must entertain Udban by midnight

729
01:26:57,082 --> 01:26:58,772
The Bavarian lived!

730
01:27:00,224 --> 01:27:03,026
- There is a problem behind that and moving forward, yes, sir

731
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:28,580
She escapes and is searched for everywhere, yes sir

732
01:28:21,736 --> 01:28:24,813
Where do we go, sir, we looked everywhere in the castle

733
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:26,400
But we did not find that

734
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:36,016
Was she hurt?

735
01:28:38,651 --> 01:28:39,651
Come

736
01:28:40,198 --> 01:28:44,333
See when this hurts you

737
01:28:45,596 --> 01:28:47,039
Wounds are healed

738
01:28:51,718 --> 01:28:52,718
This painful

739
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,198
Send your people everywhere

740
01:29:01,286 --> 01:29:05,730
Shoot every village that helps him

741
01:29:06,647 --> 01:29:07,647
I

742
01:29:08,302 --> 01:29:09,302
Station...

743
01:29:10,496 --> 01:29:11,496
I want...

744
01:29:28,192 --> 01:29:30,005
I apologize to you

745
01:29:30,513 --> 01:29:34,497
Suddenly, I remembered Tanhaji Shivaji's promise

746
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:37,259
What about the promise we made?

747
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,687
Should we change the date of marriage?

748
01:29:41,506 --> 01:29:43,894
This is how our reputation goes in the village

749
01:29:45,966 --> 01:29:49,949
You are great and your honor is our honor

750
01:29:50,657 --> 01:29:54,236
She feels that we have some preparation
for a wedding in our village, too

751
01:29:55,586 --> 01:29:59,173
But we did not specify the exact date of the wedding

752
01:30:00,356 --> 01:30:02,577
What is the difference if it is a few days late?

753
01:30:02,602 --> 01:30:05,498
We don't want this wedding to be late one day

754
01:30:06,823 --> 01:30:08,760
Please calm down

755
01:30:09,126 --> 01:30:11,784
His brother swore an oath

756
01:30:12,562 --> 01:30:16,054
First the victory convoy will start, then the Ripa wedding caravan

757
01:30:17,096 --> 01:30:18,096
Okay, Shivaji

758
01:30:18,731 --> 01:30:21,095
If I swear to God, we have accepted it

759
01:30:21,584 --> 01:30:24,805
Shivaji is a human being, but not less than God

760
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:29,750
Remember this is an honor for all of us Marathists

761
01:30:30,595 --> 01:30:37,642
When he is killed with his sword, we respect women and honor all people

762
01:30:38,567 --> 01:30:40,856
You and I will be respected

763
01:30:41,158 --> 01:30:43,396
If it bears the name of anyone

764
01:30:44,068 --> 01:30:45,531
Nobody understands

765
01:30:47,182 --> 01:30:50,316
You'd better die like a brave than live like a coward

766
01:30:50,341 --> 01:30:53,150
But what if they fail?

767
01:30:53,857 --> 01:30:57,825
God forbid, what if the disaster leader comes with a disaster?

768
01:31:04,065 --> 01:31:05,525
I promise you

769
01:31:07,396 --> 01:31:14,975
Everything that happens on the day after the due
date will definitely make your daughter our bride

770
01:31:16,485 --> 01:31:17,485
Do you feel comfortable?

771
01:31:18,344 --> 01:31:22,454
he is coming

772
01:31:22,709 --> 01:31:26,208
The leader is coming

773
01:31:37,633 --> 01:31:40,513
Get all ready for the wedding

774
01:31:40,649 --> 01:31:43,538
All I asked my brother

775
01:31:44,030 --> 01:31:45,720
What about the enemy?

776
01:31:49,824 --> 01:31:53,538
One house, two doors and two Mughal soldiers

777
01:31:54,506 --> 01:31:58,109
Big ball and adobe

778
01:32:14,822 --> 01:32:15,822
You are like conditioner

779
01:32:18,845 --> 01:32:21,384
But you cannot stop crying

780
01:32:26,768 --> 01:32:28,343
I understand everyone

781
01:32:30,291 --> 01:32:31,521
But how do I understand myself

782
01:32:40,031 --> 01:32:41,031
say something

783
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:46,657
One aspect of maintenance and the other side of commitment to the relationship

784
01:32:47,683 --> 01:32:48,976
Which one do you choose?

785
01:32:51,937 --> 01:32:53,810
I can also ask a question

786
01:32:55,568 --> 01:33:00,345
On the one hand, the mother's seal on the other hand, and the reign of your husband

787
01:33:01,458 --> 01:33:03,402
Which one should I choose?

788
01:33:04,934 --> 01:33:06,751
In the answer I can only say that

789
01:33:07,886 --> 01:33:12,616
One side of human rights and the other side of human pride

790
01:33:13,704 --> 01:33:15,711
Which one should I choose?

791
01:33:18,125 --> 01:33:21,156
There must be courage with pride

792
01:33:22,089 --> 01:33:23,406
Who can defeat you

793
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:30,430
Imagine what my reward was for winning the war

794
01:33:32,835 --> 01:33:33,835
Why should I assume

795
01:33:35,505 --> 01:33:36,505
You will definitely win

796
01:33:38,584 --> 01:33:40,496
And I give you every prize I want

797
01:33:44,299 --> 01:33:45,299
Then he promised me

798
01:33:46,825 --> 01:33:49,036
When I returned to greet you with joy

799
01:34:15,062 --> 01:34:16,062
your brother

800
01:34:16,710 --> 01:34:17,710
Fear is not perfect

801
01:34:19,141 --> 01:34:21,504
Aduban "goes out to do something"

802
01:34:23,782 --> 01:34:25,186
I want to tell you something important

803
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:33,416
Tonight, "Tanhaji" is attacking his people here

804
01:34:34,234 --> 01:34:35,837
Along with this

805
01:34:36,947 --> 01:34:37,947
We will also be released

806
01:34:39,766 --> 01:34:42,869
We just have to help her tonight

807
01:34:45,318 --> 01:34:46,318
What about her brother?

808
01:34:50,769 --> 01:34:53,260
"Accept marriage" from Adopan

809
01:34:54,150 --> 01:34:56,368
Happy to celebrate and warm up

810
01:34:56,393 --> 01:34:58,678
It is easy to do

811
01:35:04,067 --> 01:35:06,011
Are you very confident in Tana?

812
01:35:08,972 --> 01:35:11,463
I saw the tangible eyes of history

813
01:35:13,546 --> 01:35:15,281
It will change very soon

814
01:35:25,879 --> 01:35:27,791
Excuse me, sir

815
01:35:28,467 --> 01:35:31,037
I committed my army to take care of it

816
01:35:31,554 --> 01:35:36,260
Yes, there should be a fit of anger among your people

817
01:35:37,678 --> 01:35:40,725
At the door of the house

818
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:43,040
Where did you go?

819
01:35:43,948 --> 01:35:45,606
Nobody knows anything

820
01:35:46,694 --> 01:35:49,781
You are looking for him but you cannot find it

821
01:35:53,567 --> 01:35:56,138
That is why I have to take their lives

822
01:35:57,405 --> 01:35:58,405
Sir

823
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:01,518
Again, think of me as I will forgive them

824
01:36:07,818 --> 01:36:10,568
What kind of humor is this a joke game?  It is not silly

825
01:36:11,029 --> 01:36:16,140
Your desires and desires are fulfilled

826
01:36:16,798 --> 01:36:17,798
Oh really?

827
01:36:20,124 --> 01:36:23,481
I send this to you

828
01:36:34,832 --> 01:36:35,832
What does this mean?

829
01:36:36,722 --> 01:36:39,196
He said absolutely yes

830
01:36:39,291 --> 01:36:41,632
You will be prepared again

831
01:36:43,342 --> 01:36:45,476
- Sir

832
01:37:05,268 --> 01:37:08,529
What do you give me a wedding gift?  Whatever you say -

833
01:37:12,308 --> 01:37:14,291
My Maluser approach

834
01:37:57,015 --> 01:38:01,054
"Lift your sword."

835
01:38:18,901 --> 01:38:23,630
My son, my son

836
01:38:27,774 --> 01:38:31,407
Do some magic and show you courage

837
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:34,288
All enemies would be amazed

838
01:38:36,908 --> 01:38:38,915
What is that?  Lymph-

839
01:38:39,788 --> 01:38:43,447
It makes the enemy stay awake

840
01:38:46,178 --> 01:38:51,844
Today my last wish was fulfilled

841
01:38:53,043 --> 01:38:55,828
“It may be that God will return,” Tianji said

842
01:38:56,890 --> 01:38:57,890
My Father

843
01:38:58,001 --> 01:39:02,096
Everyone says he has a strong army, artillery, and army

844
01:39:02,231 --> 01:39:05,286
How do we defeat him?  Well, tell me, son

845
01:39:05,699 --> 01:39:07,731
Who won the battle against the enemy?

846
01:39:09,176 --> 01:39:12,286
Fighting to the last breath -

847
01:39:12,946 --> 01:39:15,485
who will win?

848
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:18,890
“Who is the winner? Your leader,” Masuri

849
01:39:19,275 --> 01:39:20,275
Not

850
01:39:21,947 --> 01:39:25,232
God is your follower

851
01:39:25,259 --> 01:39:27,525
It belongs to all of us

852
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:20,648
Does everyone remember their duty?  Yes sir

853
01:40:20,823 --> 01:40:26,307
I, two sergeants and "fifty" soldiers climb the abyss

854
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:31,580
If young people can't show it to us either

855
01:40:32,414 --> 01:40:35,818
Me and three hundred people in front of the gate are waiting

856
01:40:39,604 --> 01:40:44,857
I go upstairs and open the door early

857
01:40:47,516 --> 01:40:50,762
When he will open her attack he must be on both sides -

858
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:56,071
We go through the door and I and behind you and your
people if you want to increase the number of people

859
01:40:59,143 --> 01:41:02,349
What is your login?  This is the sound

860
01:41:04,357 --> 01:41:05,357
And the alarm

861
01:41:06,437 --> 01:41:09,682
This is not my voice

862
01:41:09,969 --> 01:41:11,754
"The crow's sound

863
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:23,707
Both Earth and War must be made

864
01:41:23,732 --> 01:41:28,049
Each marathon must stand with a sword

865
01:41:34,806 --> 01:41:37,194
These are my last words

866
01:41:38,028 --> 01:41:41,385
I do everything to destroy it

867
01:42:44,003 --> 01:42:45,828
And do not go

868
01:44:40,496 --> 01:44:42,131
And do not leave

869
01:44:46,397 --> 01:44:48,126
killers

870
01:44:55,918 --> 01:44:57,625
Not

871
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:00,950
Long live God

872
01:47:06,661 --> 01:47:08,915
Charm

873
01:47:26,396 --> 01:47:27,396
be cerfull

874
01:47:39,559 --> 01:47:42,336
Brother, no news about "Tana" yet

875
01:47:44,519 --> 01:47:46,233
Trust the fate

876
01:48:24,643 --> 01:48:27,515
Sir, we have been attacked

877
01:49:57,547 --> 01:50:00,904
Tana!

878
01:50:22,869 --> 01:50:25,353
Sir, there is no hope for victory

879
01:54:31,353 --> 01:54:32,353
you've been deceived

880
01:56:01,885 --> 01:56:03,758
I get it

881
01:57:55,348 --> 01:57:58,166
Take your sword

882
01:57:58,246 --> 01:58:00,443
"And turn to the enemy"

883
01:58:00,785 --> 01:58:03,618
"Attack them"

884
01:58:04,095 --> 01:58:06,515
And make them a thousand pieces

885
01:58:07,142 --> 01:58:14,983
"Do not be afraid because you have this day."

886
01:59:48,510 --> 01:59:51,042
Something big has happened

887
01:59:52,590 --> 01:59:54,446
The disaster has come

888
01:59:56,947 --> 01:59:59,962
I have to go there now

889
02:00:01,725 --> 02:00:04,327
But your leader swore an oath

890
02:00:05,645 --> 02:00:09,288
Until you have no news of your victory, get out of the ring

891
02:00:10,566 --> 02:00:12,486
Tears do not stop

892
02:00:13,971 --> 02:00:16,811
This means that his blood is flowing

893
02:00:19,288 --> 02:00:22,923
Arrange everything I should go to

894
02:01:14,181 --> 02:01:19,157
"You will be eternal forever."

895
02:02:44,806 --> 02:02:50,734
People leave an inheritance to their children and inherit our duty towards you

896
02:02:51,219 --> 02:02:54,044
Restore the freedom of this land

897
02:03:32,068 --> 02:03:37,634
Do your best to put out your fire

898
02:03:38,230 --> 02:03:43,507
"The enemy will die and you will also be high in the country."

899
02:03:43,889 --> 02:03:49,111
Do your best to put out your fire

900
02:03:49,358 --> 02:03:54,437
"The enemy will die and you will also be high in the country."

901
02:05:10,581 --> 02:05:12,818
Receive

902
02:05:25,581 --> 02:05:26,818
It was our last war

903
02:05:58,633 --> 02:06:00,633
Wake up, Tana

904
02:06:03,178 --> 02:06:04,178
You did a great job

905
02:06:04,814 --> 02:06:11,855
Tana sacrificed himself for the freedom of his country.

906
02:06:14,104 --> 02:06:17,868
Thousands of people still remember him

907
02:06:18,932 --> 02:06:22,177
Tana, save the whole country.

908
02:06:23,225 --> 02:06:28,431
Auranzeb wanted to conquer the whole
country and that is still just a wish

909
02:06:33,094 --> 02:06:37,593
Shivaji himself arranged for Ripa's marriage

910
02:07:03,887 --> 02:07:08,482
Malusari also kept his promise to Tanagi

911
02:07:15,647 --> 02:07:19,060
You will win and I will give you every gift

912
02:07:20,235 --> 02:07:25,163
So I promised you to welcome me as a bride

913
02:07:25,632 --> 02:07:33,433
"Every breath taken will be remembered"

914
02:07:34,069 --> 02:07:41,618
"Every breath taken will be remembered"

915
02:07:43,020 --> 02:07:48,226
"I will always remember you"

916
02:07:48,758 --> 02:07:55,171
"I will always be for you and I will stick"

917
02:07:56,696 --> 02:08:03,892
"I will always be for you and I will stick"
