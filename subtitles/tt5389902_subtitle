1
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,680
RBI, Reserve Bank of India

2
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,590
It is the central banking organisation of India.

3
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,830
It controls the monetary policy of the Indian rupee.

4
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,300
Here, under the guidance of RBI Governor.

5
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,680
With the chairmen and directors of all the banks in India

6
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,190
A meeting is organised to discuss
about the unclaimed accounts.

7
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,600
Having nobody to look after

8
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,600
Thousands of crores money are lying
unclaimed in the lakhs of accounts.

9
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,190
Those accounts are called as unclaimed accounts.

10
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,850
Are you thinking, how can the money be lying unclaimed?

11
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,210
If there are no transactions in the accounts for
over 10 years, they would become unclaimed accounts.

12
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,590
Banking system has begun in India 100 years ago.

13
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,770
But the bank accounts had no proper proofs.

14
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:04,580
There was nothing like Photo identity, address proof,
nominee information and Know Your Customer policies.

15
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,700
As many people died without informing their family
about the money deposited in the bank accounts

16
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,790
Those accounts were left unclaimed.

17
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,060
But through this meeting organised here,
those unclaimed accounts are to be unveiled.

18
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,540
By using the technology

19
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,990
They have decided to put the details of
the unclaimed accounts on the bank websites.

20
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,960
We have to see how many people would get blessings
from the Goddess Lakshmi after knowing the count.

21
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,080
Lacchindeviki O Lekkundi
Goddess Lakshmi has a count

22
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,110
Goddess Lakshmi

23
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,080
Goddess Lakshmi has a count

24
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,040
Goddess Lakshmi

25
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,040
Goddess Lakshmi has a count

26
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,040
Goddess Lakshmi

27
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,120
Goddess Lakshmi has a count

28
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,750
Goddess Lakshmi

29
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,640
Goddess Lakshmi

30
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,860
Goddess Lakshmi

31
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,840
Goddess Lakshmi

32
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,530
Goddess Lakshmi

33
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,700
Good morning!
Wake up wake up wake up, selfie baby

34
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,110
Take a bath, selfie baby

35
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,820
World is waiting for you baby

36
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,360
Get up and smile for the world

37
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,770
Sweety Devi Cutie Devi
Naughty Devi hottie Devi

38
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,630
Selfie Devi sexy Devi

Selfie Devi sexy Devi
Vixy Devi Devi Devi

41
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,280
Grandma!

42
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,340
Devi, have you locked the door properly?
- Yes I locked, grandma.

43
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,310
Did you check the lock twice by pulling it?
- Yes, I did.

44
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,910
That is okay, why is your neck empty?

45
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,340
Grandma, how could you say like you are watching me on live?

46
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,880
I too joined the Face book.

47
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,500
I am following you.
- Okay.

48
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,150
By the way, did you stop the habit of
peeking into neighbors house?

49
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,600
Thanks, grandma.
You reminded me at the right time.

50
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,820
Bloody fellow! Still he is sleeping.

51
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,420
Who is the one that srayed pesticide
early in the morning?

52
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,600
How can a pig know the fragrance of a perfume?

53
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,540
Oh! Always in repair.

54
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,770
If can smell this fragrance,
It means she has started.

55
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,600
If she has started,
It means I am late.

56
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,110
Madam, everyone will be fit like you
if they do not use the lift.

57
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,040
Everyone will remain like you if they do not use this.

58
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,510
Get that lift repaired.

59
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,860
Lift is working, madam.

60
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,610
He got ready so fast!

61
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,630
We grew up by eating maggi.
Anything can be done in two minutes.

62
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,070
You will die, man!

63
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,990
Hi!
- Hi.

64
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,720
Why are you so late?

65
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,780
Here, keep this inside.

66
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,460
What work does he have here?
- I do not know. Come.

67
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,940
God! My loving universal star!

68
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,170
At least from today, let my stars shine
and make them support me, god.

69
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,960
Bet, sir bet. 20 for 10
40 for 20, 80 for 40 come on

70
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,820
Move aside move!

71
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,670
Superstar Mahesh Babu Rs 100

72
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,360
Bet, sir bet. 20 for 10
40 for 20, come sir.

73
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,460
Mega Power Star Ram Charan
- Damn it!

74
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:52,090
Bet, sir bet. 20 for 10
- Powerstar Pawan Kalyan 100

75
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,080
Young Tiger NTR
- Oh

76
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,340
Hey, give me that offering.
- This offering is for the manager.

77
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,240
Hey, look over there.

78
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,550
He will never change.

79
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,680
For everyone, this is a bank.
But for me, this is a temple.

80
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,540
Because mother and father used to work here.

81
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,730
I spent my entire childhood here.

82
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,120
My parents died in an accident.

83
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,860
Even though I got several big offers

84
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,640
Feeling that I am with my parents,
I am working in this bank.

85
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,260
Welcome!

86
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,420
He has started
- Welcome to the world of money.

87
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,640
In the entire world, I like money
more than anything else.

88
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,230
That is why I am working in a bank.

89
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,640
Money is seen everywhere.

90
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,220
Money deposits and withdrawals

91
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,900
Either cheques or currency stacks

92
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,540
They must cross me
That is my position.

93
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,580
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

94
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,600
What?
- Good morning, sir.

95
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,070
You were talking about the positions

96
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,230
No sir, I am thinking about
the position of this bank without you.

97
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,980
You still have 5 years of service, even then

98
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,700
You are taking voluntary retirement
thinking about the next generation

99
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,360
Hats off sir.
Great sir.

100
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,540
I cannot think of Hussain Sagar without
Buddha and the bank without you sir.

101
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,690
Who is that again?

102
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,610
What? Has your biscuit gone waste

103
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,600
He is not such type of person who would
get tempted for biscuits or sweets.

104
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,800
Good morning, sir.
- Friday morning, Devi.

105
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,370
Early in the morning I went to the Goddess temple
and performed worship on your name

106
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,090
I brought kumkum and offering.

107
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,850
You are a goddess, dear.

108
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,310
Very good!

109
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,290
Bye, baby.
- Sir, sir offering.

110
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,730
Everyone is doing the job, but why?
Without any devotion and fear

111
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,290
If he have been a priest in the temple
instead of bank manager

112
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,510
He would have connected the god with the devotee.

113
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,300
What do you say?

114
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,960
Why?
- Hey, send that vehicle here.

115
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,560
I have all the papers, sir.

116
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,340
But there are more than required.

117
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,860
What, sir?
- Mirrors.

118
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,390
As per the rule, there should be two mirrors.

119
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,190
But why your vehicle has three?

120
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,590
That is my wish, sir.

121
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,570
There is no rule that there should
not be an extra mirror?

122
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,470
Imposing Rs 1000 fine because of
the extra mirror and your extras.

123
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,350
Fine? This is not fair, sir.

124
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,880
You have to pay.
- No.

125
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,970
My uncle is a lawyer. I know all the rules.
- You have to pay.

126
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,120
I know all the regulations and everything.
- First, you pay it and then fight in the court.

127
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,160
I am not paying, sir.
- You are supposed to pay the fine.

128
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,670
This is wrong, sir.
- Sir, greetings.

129
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,980
Hi Naveen!
- Hi, sir.

130
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,090
How are you?
- Fine, sir.

131
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,320
Even she is working in our bank. Leave her, sir.

132
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,310
I am leaving you this time as Naveen said.

133
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,830
Naveen, ask her to reduce her perfume along with extras.

134
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,070
I cannot tolerate it.

135
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,090
Deva Devam Devi

136
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,830
This is not her perfume smell.

137
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,260
How can I help you, sir?

138
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,370
Help desk, sir.

139
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,810
I have to open a locker.

140
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,550
In order to open a locker,
you have to open an account first.

141
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,390
Where should we open the account?

142
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,620
I will help you.
Come, please.

143
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,600
Come, come.

144
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,840
Please, have the seat, madam.

145
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,610
Sir, just one minute.
- Okay.

146
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,840
You hang up.

147
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,880
She is like a jersey horse.

148
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,310
Excuse me, sir.
Your signature, please.

149
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,020
Hey!
- Yes.

150
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,550
What?
- Do they need loan?

151
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,780
Looks like they can even buy the bank.
Why do they need a loan?

152
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,900
Ask them to buy.

153
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,310
Sir will take care of the bank
and I will look after madam.

154
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,400
Hey, clean it first.

155
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,070
You will come to me
- Madam sign here.

156
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,420
Oh

157
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,680
Sir, I have a doubt.
By seeing you

158
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,240
You do not look like you earned by working hard.

159
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,910
How did you get this status, sir?

160
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,150
Brother, if we get the money for sure if we work hard

161
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,600
Everyone will work hard.

162
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,780
I am also working hard, sir
by standing there.

163
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,950
Everyday lakhs and crores are coming
and going by crossing me.

164
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,290
But I am left right here.

165
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,120
If you give me a lift

166
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,650
I will get settled, sir.

167
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,580
Are you interested in sports?
- I got into the job in sports quota, sir.

168
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,330
I am talking about this sport.

169
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,220
Playing cards?

170
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,030
Do you think playing cards is so cheap?

171
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,310
If it is was included in the Olympics,
our people would have been the all-time favorites.

172
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,830
You have the fire in you.
- Sir.

173
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,590
I can see your future.

174
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,100
Get Rs 50,000 ready.
Call me.

175
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,830
See your future.
- Rs 50,000?

176
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,510
Yes.

177
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,160
Come.
- Sir.

178
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,040
Rs 50,000
What to do now?

179
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,620
No. You are killing me
- He already has problems with his two wives.

180
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,090
What will he give me?

181
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,330
Oh, I should not ask her.

182
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,010
Bro!

183
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,830
Bro

184
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,390
What did I say?

185
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,830
I just said that I will take care, right?

186
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,310
You can take care
Bro, I want Rs 50,000.

187
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,480
What, Rs 50,000 to see?
- Hand loan, bro.

188
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,790
I will return by Monday.

189
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,490
Always ditching but
have you ever returned the loan?

190
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,430
Rs 1 lakh

191
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,560
What, will you get low BP to give me the loan?

192
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,670
First, open my account.

193
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,510
What will be there in the useless account?
- First, open it.

194
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,410
Why do we need so much violence?

195
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,330
Rs 1 lakh was credited in your account.
Who is this Mahesh?

196
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,540
He might be anyone, I do not care.

197
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,810
As people like you are doing the job

198
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,120
The amount was credited to my account by mistake.

199
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,410
Still we have to give their money back, right?

200
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,020
What is the day today?
- Saturday.

201
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,940
Within half an hour,
all the bank transactions will be closed.

202
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:58,680
So

203
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,920
For the one who deposited that 1 lakh to visit
the bank and give the complaint

204
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,430
And the complaint to come to our bank
to get the clearance

205
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,720
It would take minimum one week.

206
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,860
I just need the time till Monday.

207
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,180
Your time is running bad, be careful.

208
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:16,530
Hey, Goddess Lakshmi came to
my account by missing the count

209
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,580
It means my time has started.
- Do not know

210
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:29,300
The one who leaves the public is a saint

211
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:35,260
The one who is left by the public
is a waste fellow

212
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:42,610
The one who robs the public is the worst fellow

213
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,110
Then what about human?

214
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:53,550
The one who gets crushed between
money and she, is a man

215
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,940
Why do we need all those?

216
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,610
Learn ABC from me

217
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:20,300
Wear, wear, wear, wear the mask

218
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,330
Wear the maska maskalakadi mask

219
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,300
Wear the mask like a magician

220
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:35,510
Wear, wear
Wear the mask

221
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,570
Wear maska maskalakadi mask

222
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,840
Wear the mask like a magician

223
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,450
Wear the mask while entering into action

224
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,370
Wear the mask when you are getting intoxication

225
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,530
Wear the mask during enjoyment

226
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,210
Wear the maska maskalakadi mask

227
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,350
Wear the mask like a magician

228
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,730
After falling in love deeply, if we start enjoying

229
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,890
There will be no risk, come on wear the mask

230
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:25,110
After getting impressed,
wear the mask if you want to pinch my cheeks

231
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:35,980
If you want to cool down your fire
without getting caught by anyone

232
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:42,760
Oh my dear, Ranga you beautiful thief

233
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,300
Wear the maska maskalakadi mask

234
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,350
Wear the mask like a magician

235
00:19:52,980 --> 00:20:00,610
Wear, wear, wear the mask

236
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,840
Wear the maska maskalakadi mask

237
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,670
She is creating a big problem by doing ruckus,
rocking all the village, look here

238
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,240
Wearing a beautiful sari and exposing her belly button

239
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,280
She is tempting me with her stunning beauty

240
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,230
She consumes alcohol and smoke cigar

241
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,240
She will even consume the toddy

242
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,670
She will warn the young boys and
will hit if something goes wrong

243
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,900
Oh goddess! This is the job of young boys

244
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,120
Without leaving the drink and this piece

245
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,410
If you want to stay beside me, then wear the mask

246
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,410
Without revealing your secret until the end

247
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,760
If you want to make it successful, then wear the mask

248
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:12,040
You cannot visit during day time
to receive the romantic kisses

249
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:20,070
Macha re Macha very warmly..

250
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,910
Wear the mask,
Wear the maska maskalakadi mask

251
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,170
Wear the mask like a magician

252
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:38,360
Wear, wear, wear, wear the mask

253
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,410
Wear the maska maskalakadi mask

254
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,570
Wear the mask like a magician

255
00:21:59,170 --> 00:21:59,960
Sorry!

256
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,500
Bye, master.

257
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,290
Wear, wear, wear..

258
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,350
Even though I lose several games

259
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,660
If I pee, then it will be a victory in life.

260
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,660
Is it a sentiment?

261
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,530
Do you want to piss here only?

262
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,350
One minute.

263
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,620
Carry on

264
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,150
Our sir asked to bring you.

265
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,440
Which sir?
- Our sir.

266
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,710
Where does he stay?
- If you come we will take you.

267
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,190
If not?

268
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,240
Sir, sir!
Why did you bring me, sir?

269
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,770
Sir!

270
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,600
Who are you, sir?

271
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,330
Tell me, sir.

272
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,140
Sir, they have brought me instead of
someone else by mistake.

273
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,240
I am very useless, sir.

274
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,860
Who are you, sir?
Tell me, sir.

275
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:46,110
Your account is credited Rs 1 lakh by Mahesh.

276
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,160
There will be a procedure to claim the amount.

277
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,870
Not this procedure.
Any options?

278
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,730
Sir, I asked you for the options.

279
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,500
Not hundreds not thousands but crores

280
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,130
Thousands of crores are left unclaimed in the bank

281
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,740
Many people maintain the bank accounts
secretly from their family members.

282
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,660
Some people will have fake accounts.

283
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,720
As such accounts were left unclosed

284
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,130
As they die without disclosing those
secret deposits to anyone

285
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,660
Those accounts would become the unclaimed accounts.

286
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:55,690
But now RBI has ordered to put the details of
the unclaimed accounts in the website.

287
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,300
Already few banks audited
those unclaimed accounts which they have

288
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,960
And kept them on their websites.

289
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,160
But among the very few banks which
did not keep them on the websites

290
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,470
Janata Bank in which you work is one.

291
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,900
That is why I targeted you.

292
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,250
After getting the details of those unclaimed accounts

293
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,620
Selecting few accounts among them

294
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,460
By faking the documents stating
we are the heirs to the money,

295
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,050
We can rob that money.

296
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,430
So I want the data file of
the unclaimed accounts in your bank.

297
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,600
You have to bring that.

298
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:27,470
Thank you boss.
I will bring how many ever files you want, boss.

299
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,240
Not the files which you think.

300
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,630
Computer data files.

301
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,950
In the bank, only two people
have the access to that.

302
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,010
One is the manager and the other is Devi.

303
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,430
What is this boss.

304
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,040
You said good news but immediately gave me a twist.

305
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:45,080
He is like a messenger of god and
she will worship the bank as a temple.

306
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,360
I will give you the share of 5 percent.

307
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,090
Give me another 5 percent, boss.
You will get the file.

308
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:58,370
10 percent, Okay.
- Deal, deal okay. 	- Deal.

309
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,150
Will he bring?

310
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,910
He alone can bring.

311
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,450
How to open this?

312
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,580
What are you doing?
What work do you have here?

313
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:19,280
As the time for customers is over,
I thought to help Devi, sir.

314
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,610
Is it? Wait.

315
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:31,700
Devi, Naveen is free without work it seems.
He is eager to do work.

316
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,420
He wanted to help you it seems.

317
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,980
If he is so free, ask him to take out
the complaints from the complaint box and file them.

318
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,080
That is right too.

319
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,630
You heard it?
Go and do that work.

320
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,360
That complaint box..

321
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,200
Tell me.
- Brother, what you said is correct.

322
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,860
If the finger print of either Devi or
Manager is not scanned on the device

323
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,660
It is impossible to open the data room.

324
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,660
But you do not worry, brother.

325
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,640
I will follow Devi seriously, I will get it done.
- Okay.

326
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,650
My percentage

327
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,510
Can he not hear me completely?

328
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,300
Why are you not answering my call from three days?

329
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,690
Where did you go?
- She does not have time sense at all.

330
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,370
She has come.

331
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,610
He might not have got up still.

332
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,050
One second one second.

333
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,800
I will open it. I will open it.
One second.

334
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,560
Please.

335
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,650
Why did he change his route?

336
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,980
Devi!
- Go! - Devi!

337
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,590
I think your connection is temporarily disconnected.

338
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,030
Why? Are you looking to get connected permanently?

339
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,520
We can think of connecting later,
come sit on the bike first.

340
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,610
What is the matter?

341
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,340
Recently, all out friends went to
the restaurant together.

342
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,390
As she has no friends, I thought of introducing
my friends and asked her to come there.

343
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,900
There we have clicked a few photos.

344
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:49,200
I posted one of them on the Face book.
- So?

345
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:55,610
For that photo, many people commented
on me more than on her.

346
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,510
What else?

347
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,980
She felt jealous and unfriended me.
- Oh my god!

348
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,270
The days have gone where they complain on the comments

349
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,320
Now they are feeling sad that they do not get comments.

350
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,470
Oh Lord!

351
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,120
Go and talk. All the best.

352
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:21,520
Sorry, Devi.
I did not expect that you would be so hurt.

353
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,400
Devi, please try to understand.

354
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,140
This situation looks favourable for me.

355
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,220
Yes!

356
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,810
Pooja madam, you do not worry.

357
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,550
I will offer you the lift daily.

358
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,970
It is not about the lift.

359
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,540
You want your friendship to be connected again?

360
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,860
Leave it for me.
- What will you do?

361
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,410
We have to remove the thorn with a thorn.

362
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,940
We can also remove it using a pin, right?

363
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,300
We can also remove it using the mobile.

364
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,720
Thorn?
- No, still.

365
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,310
Give me your mobile once.

366
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,980
Sweety Devi Cutie Devi
Naughty Devi hottie Devi

367
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:53,560
Selfie Devi sexy Devi
Vixy Devi Devi Devi

368
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,780
Pooja Pooja!

369
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,990
Where did you hide so much talent all these days?

370
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,020
Superb! Fantastic!

371
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,800
What you are talking about?

372
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,600
You never told me that you have
so much talent in photography.

373
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,910
Did you see how many likes I have got?

374
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,250
3,000 likes in half an hour.

375
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,110
Even I do not know that I look so beautiful.

376
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,460
I did not click them, it is Naveen.

377
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,460
No chance at all.

378
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,610
Promise. Really he is the one who captured them.

379
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,910
Mr Naveen! Come here.

380
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,920
Come here, sir.

381
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,130
She is appreciating that you clicked them perfectly.

382
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,070
Pooja's marriage was fixed.
You are the photographer.

383
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,860
Hello, me?
Yes, coming.

384
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,320
Oh, too much.

385
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,130
They are not good.
- Let us take this.

386
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,790
Hey, my bag!
- Hey, leave it. Wait.

387
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,600
Leave
- You bloody thief, leave.

388
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,250
Leave it.

389
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:23,100
Hey!
- Leave it.

390
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,220
Why did you steal that?
- I am not a thief, sir. Take your bag.

391
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:35,230
Even then I do not lose this chance.
- Sir, take your bag.

392
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,090
Hit him!

393
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,010
Do you know who he is?
- He might be anyone, what is now?

394
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,030
Take it.
- Hey, my bag.

395
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,790
Oh, Devi!

396
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,220
Leave about the bag.
We can buy another one.

397
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,650
My phone is there in it.

398
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,820
Devi!

399
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:09,960
Yes!

400
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,290
You devil!

401
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,000
Naveen!

402
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,940
Naveen

403
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,530
No, Naveen.

404
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,670
He is escaping.

405
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,440
Sir sir!
- Done?

406
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,910
Someone is about to kill us by beating, sir.
- Killing? - Yes, sir.

407
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,050
Who is that?

408
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:44,240
Brahmaji IPS
Batch No 67. Encounter specialist.

409
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:49,800
Department posted him the mock drill officer
who educates the public to reduce his aggressiveness.

410
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,320
Hey stop! stop!

411
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,600
Who are you?
Are you their leader?

412
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,850
We are police.
- If you are the police, will you snatch the purse?

413
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,390
Hey, not that. As robbery, chain snatching
and pick-pocketing are happening in this area

414
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,430
We came on a mock drill here.

415
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,660
We are doing a Police drill.
- What is a police drill?

416
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,400
To educate public, how to be alert
when a roberry takes place

417
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,670
For that, we are doing police drill.
- How can I believe that you are police?

418
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,670
Bloody! How should I make him believe?

419
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,910
Here, this is gun.

420
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,630
This is a cigarette lighter, right?
- You bloody!

421
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,650
Real police gun.
- Sorry, sir.

422
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:23,900
Will you believe now?
- I believe, sir. Sorry.

423
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,140
Hey, move.

424
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,370
Madam, here is your bag.
Here is your knife.

425
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,270
Bye, madam.

426
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:35,330
Naveen!

427
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,760
Yes!

428
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,190
Hello!

429
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,510
Not only your body, you should also fill the vehicle.

430
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,920
Instead of taking a class in the morning,
she can give me a lift, right?

431
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,640
Come, I will give you lift.

432
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:33,710
Do not dry the clothes outside.
Today it would rain.

433
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,010
Bye, sister,
- Bye!

434
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,290
Bye!

435
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:40,950
Get down.

436
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,260
I said get down.

437
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:44,850
What happened?

438
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:53,490
Go, man!

439
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,370
Stop it.

440
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,220
Hey! Okay, come and sit.

441
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,980
You should maintain the distance.
- Okay, madam.

442
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,420
I have a small doubt.
- Ask.

443
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,320
Any vehicle will have two mirrors.
But why did you keep three?

444
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,710
One is to look at right side, one is to look at left

445
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,840
The middle one is to look at me.
- Oh!

446
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,330
Take that bag.

447
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,080
There is a phone in the bag.
Take it out.

448
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,670
There is a selfie stick in that. Take out that also.
- Okay.

449
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:30,730
Why?

450
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,670
To take a selfie during self drive.

451
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,180
Get down.

452
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,320
The bank is nearby, right.
You come by walk.

453
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:49,450
Why?

454
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,520
If anyone sees us, will they not think otherwise?

455
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,480
Oh
- Get down.

456
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,740
Bye!
- Bye.

457
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,440
From 'if anyone sees us, they might think otherwise',

458
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,460
I will make you say, 'I do not care if anyone sees'.

459
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,310
Sir, put this cheque in the drop box.
- Will that box give the money?

460
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,670
Sir, this is an account payee cheque.

461
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,930
You can draw money from
your account once it is cleared.

462
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,170
No need of any box or a drawer.

463
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,130
That Nookaraju said that
I will get money after giving this cheque.

464
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,000
Mr Naveen!

465
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,030
Mr Naveen?

466
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,260
Mr Naveen?

467
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,500
Mr Naveen?

468
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,820
Mr Naveen?

469
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,610
Can you please come here.
- Yes, coming.

470
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,390
Tell me, Ms Devi.

471
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:08,360
This sir do not know the difference between a
bearer cheque and an account payee cheque.

472
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,740
Will you explain him?
- Suresure.

473
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,330
Come, dear. Come.

474
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,060
What a chance you gave me, dear.

475
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,170
What is this early in the morning?

476
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,220
It is 11 o'clock.
Are you sleeping still?

477
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,700
Holiday What would I do geting up?

478
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,780
Get ready fast, let us go for shopping.

I got a habit of forgetting everything hastily

482
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,120
That is very nice

483
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:27,430
Very nice

484
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:33,290
Thought to dance by showing all my greatness

485
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:37,840
My heart left me due to ruckus while dancing

486
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,130

I came in front of you, please look at me

493
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:32,740
Covering my thoughts with dreams

494
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,480
I am in front of your eyes, honey bee

495
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:42,370
There might be a man handsome than me

496
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:46,700

who is available for you like me

Cannot get rid of the madness which is holding the young age

503
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,100
It will not go unless you melt

504
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:32,320
Coming with a relation and giving me lenience

505
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,790
You are the light of your beauty, my Lacchi

506
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,660

507
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:46,150

put them in your hand, says the bond

508

When you are eager to make me agree

00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:15,570
In that eager, your real face has been revealed

515
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,790
That is very nice

516
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,490
When you are making efforts
to impress me with your greatness

517
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:27,000
The vibrations in that efforts got confused

518
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,360

If you do not bring the data tomorrow,
the ending will be like that.

525
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,720
What?

526
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,330

- Go.

527
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,210
Data.. Data..

528
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,720
Hey, I am scared looking at you.

529
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,480
How royal you were?

530
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,250
From the time when you have been following that Devi

531
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,570
Your stars went out of the track, and are making you tensed.

532
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,090
There is a known astrologer named Black Star.

533
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,650
If you meet him,
he will put your stars again on the track.

534
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,890
Come, let us meet him.

535
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,990
Come, dude. Let us go.

536
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,330
Go, man.

537
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,440
If not now, let us go tomorrow.
- Hey, get lost.

538
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,770
Devi! One minute, I am sorry.
I forgot to say.

539
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:08,880
I got a call to submit the data of
those unclaimed accounts by tomorrow morning.

540
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:11,290
Make it today itself at any cost.

541
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,850
It is almost over, sir.
- Okay.

542
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:15,830
But I will complete it and go.
- Okay. Very good.

543
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,610
If you want you can call the cab. Okay?

544
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,310
The main problem is with the cabs, right?

545
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,360
Naveen!
- Sir.

546
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,130
Come here.
- Coming, sir.

547
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:29,250
Tell me, sir.
- I have given some work to Devi.

548
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:32,830
Be with her to help and drop her at home.
- Okay, sir.

549
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,240
You both stay nearby, right?
- Yes, sir.

550
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,910
Naveen! Get me the file of 1958.
- Okay.

551
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,610
Devi, coffee
- Okay.

552
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,030
Door
- Oh.

553
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,820
Hello.
- Devi, open the door.

554
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,410
Okay, one second.

555
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,550
Devi!
- Yes.

556
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,720
Oh, no. Sorry, Devi.
It fell by mistake.

557
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,890
It slipped. Sorry, Devi.

558
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,270
Why sorry?
Will anyone throw it intentionally?

559
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,710
I will go to the washroom and come back. Okay?
- Okay.

560
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,370
Tell me, grandma.

561
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:53,160
I understood.. it is about the marriage, right?

562
00:46:56,170 --> 00:47:00,540
Now you can stop attending the functions
in search of the groom for me.

563
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:03,360
I do not know yet, grandma.

564
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,180
I will tell you after I get 100 percent trust.

565
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,820
Shall we go?
- Okay.

566
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:46,130
It was fine as you are here.
If not it would have been very late.

567
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,720
Park the bike and come.

568
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:00,520
No, I have some other work outside.
You go.

569
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,580
Where? Shopping?

570
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:05,020
No, birthday party of a friend.

571
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,570
Oh! So today you saved your money.

572
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,380
Okay, enjoy. Bye!
- Bye.

573
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:17,670
Naveen!

574
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,440
If you do not bring the data tomorrow,
the ending will be like that.

575
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:45,470
Answer the call.. Answer the call.

576
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:51,680
Bloody fellow, Answer the call.

577
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,330
He has come.

578
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,500
You are safe as you brought it.

579
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:10,580
If not you would have been died.

580
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:23,770
Crores.. Crores of rupees.

581
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:27,360
I would like to rob everything.
- Why late, let us get everything.

582
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,340
All the accounts will not suit us.

583
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:34,010
We have to list out the accounts
without nominees and records.

584
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,220
Perfect!

585
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,360
Ankalamma
Umadevi

586
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,840
There are no nominees and records.
There is no chance of finding them.

587
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,400
These are the accounts.
Perfect!

588
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:10,810
What next, brother?

589
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:12,730
What next?

590
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,170
We need the heirs of Ankalamma and Umadevi.

591
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,390
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

592
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:36,510
How can I help you?

593
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,170
I came to know that my grandma
had an account in your bank.

594
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,800
I came to inquire.
- Okay.

595
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,140
One minute.

596
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:43,680
Details are in this.

597
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,860
You please be seated, sir.
- Okay.

598
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,420
I will inquire.
- Thank you.

599
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:51,320
Take it.

600
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,390
Sir, you have to submit the original documents.
- Okay.

601
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,690
How can I help you, madam?
- I need some information.

602
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:03,520
About what?

603
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,470
I came to know about the account details of my grandma.

604
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:10,510
Hello, mam.
- Hello.

605
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,340
So, we need your documents to prove
that you are her grand daughter.

606
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:17,070
Yes, I am her grand daughter.
- Oh, that is okay.

607
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,590
But we still need some documents
to give you further details.

608
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:22,270
So, I will do one thing.
I will write it down.. Yeah..

609
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,060
You bring it. Okay.
- Okay.

610
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,440
Hi.
- Good morning, sir.

611
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,640
All the documents what you asked are in this file.
- Okay, sir.

612
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:31,170
Okay, madam.

613
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:35,410
I will submit all the documents and call you.
- Sure, thank you. - Welcome.

614
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:41,090
Hello, sir.
- Hi.

615
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,070
I received a call that the documents
were matched and can claim the amount.

616
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:46,850
Yes, sir. I called you.
- Oh, is that you? - Congrats.

617
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:51,840
Brother, there is a small formality to claim the amount.
- Tell me.

618
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:54,450
You too should have the account in this bank.

619
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,520
So you have to open an account in this bank.

620
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:00,340
What are you thinking?

621
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:02,960
You did not say this before, right?

622
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,800
That is
- What to do now?

623
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,350
The chequebook will not be given
immediately after opening the account, right?

624
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:08,810
That is not a big problem.

625
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:11,280
You fill that form and sign on it.
That is enough.

626
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,920
I will give you the chequebook now itself.

627
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:17,380
Sir, Ankalamma file.

628
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:34,030
Okay. The one who came to claim
the account of Ankalamma.. Who is that?

629
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:36,900
Yes! Mahesh.. Ask him to come.
- Okay, sir.

630
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:41,570
You need not go anywhere. Call on phone.
- Okay, sir.

631
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:49,630
Naveen! Manager is calling Mahesh.
Send him inside.

632
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:54,250
Call from manager.
He wants to talk to you.

633
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:55,640
He asked you to come to his chamber.

634
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:57,420
Everything is clear, right?
What will he speak?

635
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,590
Do not get tensed.

636
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,310
He will ask you to invest in bonds of fixed deposits.

637
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,630
You tell him very confidently that
you would like to donate it to some trust.

638
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,510
Meanwhile, I will open the accounts
and get the cheque book ready.

639
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:08,810
Cool, brother.
- Okay.

640
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:11,870
May I come in, sir?
- Yes.

641
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:15,570
Welcome to the grandson of Ankalamma.

642
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:18,160
Mahesh
- Mahesh

643
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,770
Vibrations are not only in the name, but also in the hand.

644
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,290
Sit.
- Thank you, sir.

645
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:25,160
You have to thank her but not me.

646
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:28,810
She is the one who gave the future
to the accounts which were in the dust.

647
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,440
Oh! Thank you.

648
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:34,750
Mr Mahesh, what do you do?
- Business in the states.

649
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,160
Which state?
Tamil Nadu or Karnataka or Maharashtra?

650
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:44,000
United States of America, sir.
- United States Very good.

651
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,430
When did you get settled there?
- Long back.

652
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:48,550
Long long ago

653
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:52,590
By the way, how did you get the details of this account?

654
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,940
When I was clearing the properties, I got the account details.

655
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:01,170
Oh, you emptied there and you are going to empty here.

656
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:07,540
May I come in, sir?
- Come Come in.

657
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:08,960
What?

658
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:11,160
Sir has forgot the signature.
- Take it.

659
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,970
Thank you, sir.
- You wait. I have some work with you.

660
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:21,450
A small request.
- Tell me.

661
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,390
For our bank which has protected your account so safely

662
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,520
You too should do a small favour.

663
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:31,360
You wanted me to invest in the bonds.
- Yes.

664
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,590
Sorry, sir.
That is the money of my grandmother.

665
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:36,230
I would like to donate it to a good trust in her name.

666
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:40,140
Oh, that is nice.
Very good.. Very good!

667
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,790
Okay, did you ever see your grandmother?

668
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:49,140
My grandmother was not alive
by the time when I born.

669
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,520
So, I do not know more about her.
- That is it, right

670
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:53,230
It is okay if you are not aware then.

671
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,930
But as you came to claim her account,
you have to know it now.

672
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:05,510
Several years ago, an elderly man came
to open the account in our bank.

673
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,830
I thought it was on his name.

674
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,890
But he said

675
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,720
No on my name, but on the name Ankalamma.

676
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,110
I asked who is she?
Then he said

677
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:22,970
It did not rain sufficiently
in their place for a long time it seems.

678
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:28,090
Then they vowed to the village goddess
whom they worship.

679
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,170
With her blessings, as it rained sufficiently

680
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,900
Their crops got high yield.

681
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,400
After a few days, they built a temple
for that goddess it seems.

682
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:44,560
The Hundi at the temple was filled
with the gifts offered by the devotees.

683
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:51,020
Then that elderly man, with the fear
that someone may rob that Hundi

684
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:55,170
He opened the account in the name of
that goddess in our bank

685
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,590
And deposited the whole amount in our bank.

686
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:05,210
Ankalamma is the name of that goddesss, man.

687
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:15,060
Now, tell me.
Is Ankalamma your grandmother?

688
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,550
Devi, call Ms Jyoti.

689
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:31,180
Sir, shall we talk personally?
- No talking, nothing to talk.

690
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:33,430
Sir, I will go.
- Where will you go?

691
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,800
You heard about the Penna river dam

692
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:39,980
Will not you hear about the Somasila floodgate?

693
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:42,940
May I come in, sir?

694
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:47,360
Welcome! Come in.

695
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:54,640
Oh my god!

696
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,620
Looking at you, I feel like seeing Umadevi madam.

697
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:05,640
The way of wearing sari, bindi and that royalty

698
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,570
Thank you, sir.
- Very happy, baby.

699
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,760
At least now you came to settle the account of Umadevi.

700
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:17,690
By the by, meet Mr Mahesh.
Same to same as your case.

701
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:21,760
A small request.

702
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,400
You would ask me to invest the money
in your bank, is that it?

703
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:28,570
I would like to start an old age home in the name
of my grandmother and do service.

704
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,710
That is nice.
Very good.. Very good!

705
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,390
Exactly even sir has the same thought.

706
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,770
Did you ever see your grandmother?

707
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,590
She died at my childhood itself.

708
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,330
So you do not know anything about her.

709
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:50,970
It is okay even if you do not see her

710
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:54,640
You have to know a little about her.
- Tell me.

711
00:57:56,230 --> 00:58:01,430
Your grandmother Umadevi was
the only successor of Rao Bahadur Rangarao.

712
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:09,320
He nurtured her with utmost care as she has no mother.

713
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,140
He never said no to whatever she asked.

714
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:17,730
Umadevi who reached her young age said
her father about her love towards a musician.

715
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,070
Even Rangarao agreed for that.

716
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:27,980
He did not like to marry Umadevi who did not
know even the basics of music

717
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,220
Said that musician directly.

718
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:44,380
As he was unable to perform the marriage
of his daughter and did fulfil her wish

719
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:47,350
Rangarao died in that pain.

720
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:50,210
But Umadevi did kept quite.

721
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,370
With the determination, she started to learn music.

722
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,890
But will that musician keep quite?

723
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:59,810
How much time will he wait?
He married another girl.

724
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:04,490
Unable to digest this, Umadevi committed suicide and died.

725
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:14,090
The rumour is that even now the soul of
Umadevi is moving somewhere practising music.

726
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:22,830
How did Umadevi who died without
getting married give birth a son?

727
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:25,360
And when were you born to him?

728
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:29,860
He is the grandson of Goddess Ankalamma

729
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:35,400
She is the granddaughter of
unmarried Umadevi who is roaming as a soul.

730
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:08,790
Goddess Lakshmi

731
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:16,890
Who could guess what will happen every minute?

732
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:19,580
Sir! I want to talk to you, sir.

733
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,900
Sir I want to talk to you, sir.

734
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,530
Please reduce the volume, sir.

735
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:27,830
Okay, tell me.

736
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:35,220
Now tell me. What is your personal thing?

737
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:37,640
It is about the honour of our bank, sir.

738
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,350
I will have to talk to our manager once.
- Okay, call him.

739
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,930
What, man?
Are they getting bashed up in the cell?

740
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,720
When you are in our bank which has been
completed 100 years without any remark

741
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,650
If anyone knows that someone tried
to do a fraud, is it not a disreputaion sir!

742
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,870
Who will receive this direputation, sir?
- Who?

743
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,350
It is us, right?

744
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,740
If the press comes to know about this,
what happens to the reputation of our bank, sir?

745
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,650
I will talk with SI once, give him the phone.

746
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:03,540
Manager is on call.

747
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:07,190
Tell me, sir.
- This is the matter of a bank.

748
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:09,750
If this reach the media, not only we

749
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,120
All our customers will also get into the trouble.

750
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,660
We will take care not to repeat such an incident once again

751
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:18,290
For this time, give them a warning and leave.

752
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,880
Okay, sir.
Take care of us too.

753
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:22,600
Our person will take care, sir.

754
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:23,990
Okay, brother.

755
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,780
If I see you either in this city or state,
I will bash you up in the cell.

756
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:39,110
Are you playing a drama?

757
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:42,050
What, boss? I just played a trick on the police
and saved you from them

758
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:44,430
Why are you holding my shirt?
- Not the shirt, but I should hold your neck.

759
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:48,510
Yes, you would.. both planning and execution are yours.
But you blame me! Leave me.

760
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:50,850
I salute you and your operation.

761
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:52,940
Do not meet me again.
Do not even call me.

762
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,570
It is better for you both if you shift
from here as soon as possible.

763
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:57,890
Good bye!

764
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:02,630
Naveen, what happened?
- What happened?

765
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,700
An unexpected problem occured in our bank family.

766
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:09,080
If the problem becomes public, we will be on the footpath.

767
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:12,980
Using my talent and dealing privately with the police

768
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:14,560
I solved that problem.

769
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:18,060
You keep quiet. Got it?

770
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,400
There are some people, but why?

771
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,410
They will not work other than worshipping.

772
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:25,140
One has to work like you.
I am very proud of you, dude.

773
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,870
Okay, I will meet the manager and come.
- Okay.

774
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,530
Hey, everything is okay, right?
- 100 percent okay, sir.

775
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:42,940
They will not even look at our bank from now.

776
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:48,950
Can I believe you 100 percent?

777
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:06,690
Sir, why did you come here at this time?

778
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:10,370
Nothing, I thought to see you and came here.

779
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:14,060
Okay, can I believe you 100 percent?

780
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,270
Sir, about what you are
- You do not think of anything now.

781
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:20,630
I will tell you an idea with which you can get them both.

782
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:23,650
What both, sir?
- One is Devi

783
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,960
Second one is the money which you get if you give the data.

784
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:29,090
Data? What data, sir?

785
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,880
I got the doubt when you followed Devi.

786
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:38,500
It was confirmed when you were
moving near the data room.

787
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:45,170
Then I fixed a camera in the data room
and connected it to my mobile.

788
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:47,280
I saw your entire movie.

789
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:54,810
Sir, one gang trapped me.
But she is believing me heartfully.

790
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:56,370
I cannot lose that trust, sir.

791
01:03:56,620 --> 01:04:00,020
So I have decided not to give that data, sir.

792
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:02,970
No, you have to give the data to them.

793
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:07,090
I cannot cheat Devi, sir.
- Already you cheated her.

794
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:11,810
If you do not give the data, then
you will be the one who ruins the life of Devi.

795
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,520
Okay, what do you want me to do?

796
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:15,870
You have the pen drive, right

797
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:19,620
Give this pen drive instead of that pen drive.

798
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:24,670
The further story will keep on going automatically.

799
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:28,060
I will do as you said only if you say that
there will be no problem to Devi.

800
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:31,420
The problem occurs only if you do not do as I said, right

801
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:36,220
How perfectly you managed, man!

802
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:39,420
But you narrated the fake stories
and scared them well, sir.

803
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:42,740
They are not the fake stories but are real.
- Yes, real!

804
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:45,550
Now the main story begins.

805
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:49,510
Here, the cheques prepared on their names.

806
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:53,550
Take my car and meet the bank manager of Kukatpalli.

807
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,410
He will give you the cash, bring it.

808
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:57,400
What?

809
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:02,480
How can we share it, sir?
- You tell me.

810
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:05,960
As we are only two, Goddess account is for you
and ghost account is for me.

811
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,360
We will do as you said.
You go and bring the cash. Go.

812
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:10,530
What again?

813
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:16,190
Sir, Devi will come to know
if the amount gets clear from the accounts.

814
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:17,150
Oh!

815
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,370
Devi, come to my cabin.

816
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:26,580
Yes, sir.

817
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:30,500
Devi, from now, only I will deal with
that unclaimed accounts section.

818
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:37,160
Sir, but
- I saw the thing you did, right

819
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,780
The documents were perfect, sir.

820
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:42,160
The one who did the scam planned it more perfectly than you.

821
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:56,770
You made her cry, sir

822
01:05:56,970 --> 01:06:00,130
Just tears, right? Wipe them with currency notes.
They will vanish, you go.

823
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:24,510
Why are you here?

824
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,980
Sorry, I came to the wrong address.
- You came to the right address, come.

825
01:06:28,370 --> 01:06:29,450
Come inside.

826
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:40,330
Come, keep it there.

827
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,300
Sit down.

828
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,740
Why are you with them, sir? They are the gamblers, sir.
- Is it?

829
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:56,930
They asked me to bring Rs 50,000 to the club
and grabbed Rs 1 lakh from me.

830
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:57,680
Okay.

831
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,460
Cheating the innocents like me

832
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,760
They opened the locker in our bank to hide all the money, sir.

833
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:07,560
It was me who made open that.

834
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:11,420
Do you know where the money which is
being used for rotation in that club has come

835
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,460
It is from our bank.

836
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:17,400
The way how I used you to bring out
the money which was kept unclaimed

837
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:20,100
To put that inside, I used these two.

838
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:23,330
I no need of all these.
If you give my share, I will go.

839
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:26,190
Share? Dear, share it seems.

840
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,890
What, baby?
Do not you like it.?

841
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,690
Why are you doing like that?
Are you saying no?

842
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:42,830
She likes only receiving but does
not want to give even a single not it seems.

843
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:46,720
You are not very aged, right?
You are a young boy.

844
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:48,910
You can do such things so many. Now you go.

845
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:50,320
Sir
- Go!

846
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:52,670
Think of it once.
- I said go, right? Go.

847
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:01,530
This is injustice, sir.
- That is it. So what?

848
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,910
You will get a rotten death, sir.

849
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:07,720
God will never forgive you, sir.

850
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:30,930
Sir.. sir!

851
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,120
Why are you going, sir?

852
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:37,570
Have you forgotten that today is Monday?
- Shivoham

853
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:41,900
Worshipped Lord Shiva and brought this Vibuthi.
No evil eye will fall on our bank.

854
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:56,320
Go.

855
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:06,290
Please come.

856
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:21,430
They hide the money in the bank
again after robbing it from the bank.

857
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:23,090
But they cheated me.

858
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,430
Why is it burning?

859
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:09,800
Why is it appearing again?

860
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:20,860
Devi, come to my room.

861
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,250
Sir, you called me

862
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:33,170
What is this?

863
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:35,430
Vibuthi has turned red and it is burning.

864
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:41,990
Vibuthi How can Vibuthi turn red?
- That is what I am asking, right?

865
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:48,010
Devi!

866
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:50,970
Why the smoke is coming?

867
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:53,630
Where is your face?
Only the hair is visible.

868
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:56,090
Not devi

869
01:10:58,210 --> 01:10:59,680
Goddess

870
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:04,570
Where?

871
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:08,260
Why are you coming close?

872
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:09,610
Do not look at me like that.

873
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:10,860
Hey!

874
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:13,230
It is me, baby. Your bank manager.

875
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:15,900
When one's destruction time arrives,
one has extreme thoughts.

876
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,370
That is why Vibuthi turned red.

877
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:23,690
Ankalamma wishes for your blood.

878
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:27,560
Ankalamma? Who is Ankalamma?

879
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,420
Who is Ankalamma

880
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,230
How could you lift it like that?

881
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:37,820
You took the donations which were offered
by my devotees after their wish gets fulfilled

882
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:39,280
And do not you remember me?

883
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,420
Goddess Ankalamma!
Salutations, goddess.

884
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,470
I remember, goddess.

885
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:47,980
If I step on you,
you will vomit the blood and die.

886
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,320
I mad a mistake because of greedy, goddess.

887
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,570
I will do whatever you ask me to do.

888
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:57,170
Why are you moving like that?

889
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,540
Oh, no! Why did you fall down?

890
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:04,330
I think the goddess has left her.

891
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:07,920
Devi.. Devi!

892
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,650
What happened, sir?

893
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:14,390
The face turned back and the hair came front side

894
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:16,390
Then hair went back and the face came front side.

895
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:18,800
I think you felt giddy.
Even for me.

896
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Why, sir?
Why Vibuthi turned red?

897
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:27,630
I kept kumkum on Vibuthi, Ankalamma.
- Ankalamma?

898
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,540
That is
I am saying that I kept the kumkum of Ankalamma.

899
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:32,690
Do not know, sir

900
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:36,310
You are very disturbed
since the time of Ankalamma account issue.

901
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:40,060
Tomorrow is Tuesday, right
- Yes.

902
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:43,280
I will go to Hanuman temple,
perform pooja in your name and bring the Sindhoor.

903
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:49,140
What is he?

904
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:52,830
Naveen, come to my room immediately.

905
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:54,990
Come, sit.

906
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:57,350
What is this appearance, sir?

907
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,320
Devi is a goddess.
- I know.

908
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,140
How do you know?

909
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:05,870
Goddess of my love.

910
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:09,710
Not the Goddess of love.
Goddess of the village.

911
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:13,330
Devi has been possessed by Goddess Ankalamma.

912
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:16,140
She lifted such a big sofa up to this height.

913
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,050
She would have lifted me and
thrown away after a while.

914
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:21,970
She came to know that we took the money.

915
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:24,570
Now we but you.
- Yes, it is me.

916
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:28,090
Said that she would see my end.
- She should have done it already.

917
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:29,380
She postponed it unnecessarily.

918
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:32,210
Why are you so angry with me?
- Or else what, sir?

919
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:33,780
You said two stories to take away money.

920
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:35,530
Another story to skip my share?

921
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:38,150
My boy, the account of ghost is yours.

922
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:42,620
But you follow that Devi correctly
and find the actual matter.

923
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:46,380
I will do it, but you will not narrate a new story, right?
- I will not say.

924
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:47,970
The account of ghost is yours.

925
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,630
So expensive?
There he is selling at a very low price.

926
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:03,210
These are fresh.
- They are not very fresh.

927
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:04,450
But you are telling more
- Hi, Devi.

928
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:09,420
I will take if you give me for Rs 10.
- No, these are of first-class quality.

929
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:11,890
You will say first class quality 100 percent guarantee

930
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:15,180
We cannot know how many damages
will be there unless we cut.

931
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:20,820
Please come.. fresh vegetables.
Come, madam.

932
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:22,700
How much are these?
- One kilo for Rs 40, madam.

933
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,200
It is too much.
- what do you want, Devi?

934
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,710
What about that?
- 250 grams for Rs 20.

935
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:26,960
Shall I bargain?
- No.

936
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:30,400
Not only them, you can manage everything.

937
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:31,970
What happened now?

938
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:36,870
Do not talk.
I should not believe even 1 percent.

939
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,690
Me?
- Yes, you.

940
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:44,340
Is there anyone who says positively about you in the bank?

941
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:46,450
Waste fellow!

942
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:54,540
What happened?

943
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:58,670
She hated me that there is nobody
who says positively about me in the bank.

944
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:00,020
Did she say that?
- Yes.

945
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:01,780
Hey, where are you going?

946
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:05,200
She said it is enough if one person says it, right?
That one is me, I will say it and come.

947
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:09,630
At this time? Now?
- This is the right time to say about you.

948
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,430
I am going.
- Hey - Wait. I will set it.

949
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:14,910
Correct!

950
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,470
Devi.. Devi!

951
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,000
Devi!

952
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,180
Oh, the door is open.

953
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:30,210
Devi.. Devi! Come.

954
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,220
Devi, what disguise it this?

955
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:40,540
Why are you saying Devi
like you are calling your wife

956
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:41,470
Your name is Devi, right?

957
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:47,420
Not Devi Umadevi.
- Umadevi?

958
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:57,930
What happened to him?
Why did not he come yet?

959
01:16:03,690 --> 01:16:06,280
Ms Umadevi Please leave me, Umadevi.

960
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:17,310
What happened?

961
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,750
What happened?
- She bashed me badly.

962
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:22,210
Bashed you?
- Yes.

963
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:23,610
How can she bash you? Damn!

964
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:28,330
What did you say about me?
- She has bashed me before I started.

965
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:29,730
She would have killed me if I told her.

966
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:34,760
Will you bash my friend?
Devi, you are finished.

967
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,820
Hey, where are you going?
- Hey, you go.

968
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:38,810
Hey, listen to me.
- Hey, you get lost.

969
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:40,610
She has a powerful weapon in her hand. Do not go.

970
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:42,630
It might be a weapon but here it is Naveen.

971
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:44,540
Hey, I am coming. This is the flat.

972
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:47,560
Devi.. Devi!

973
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,510
Why did you stop there, come in.

974
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:55,470
I am waiting for you.

975
01:16:56,930 --> 01:16:58,290
For me?
- Yes.

976
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:08,780
What kind of decoration is this?
- I decorated for you.

977
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:12,300
Why? Is this not looking good?
- Good.

978
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:17,760
Why are you standing like that?
Come, sit.

979
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:21,130
I will decorate even you.

980
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:32,600
The power has gone, right?
How can you do makeup in the darkness, Devi?

981
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,570
What if it is dark?
I can do perfectly in the darkness.

982
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:39,850
Why are you calling me Devi always.
You can call me Uma, right?

983
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:42,200
Uma?
- Yes.

984
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:44,190
You want my account but

985
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:46,490
What is wrong in calling me Uma?

986
01:17:46,690 --> 01:17:47,630
Are you Umadevi?

987
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:49,840
It has happened as manager said.

988
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:52,690
Anyway, I do not have any connection
with your bank account.

989
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,480
What are you doing, Devi?

990
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:01,970
You will destroy the makeup.
That is why I am fastening your hands.

991
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:03,090
Why are you fastening my hands?

992
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:05,630
Devi! No Umadevi!
- Do not move.

993
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:07,140
There is no connection between your account and me.

994
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:08,250
My manager has stolen everything.

995
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:10,550
Where did she go?

996
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:23,720
Shall I sing a song?
- Song?

997
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:36,730
Vashigolisova

998
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:42,940
Vasoligoshiva

999
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:25,380
Hello!
- Sir, it is me Naveen.

1000
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:27,580
Why did you call me at this time?

1001
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:29,820
Devi is not a goddess but a devil, sir.
- Devil?

1002
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:30,910
Umadevi, sir.

1003
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,370
Had you a glance in that disguise?
- Yes.

1004
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:37,960
Here I am scared of her, but you are laughing!
- What should I do instead of laughing?

1005
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:45,020
You said Devi is a goddess. I want the account of the ghost.
Did she give you nicely? Are you satisfied?

1006
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:46,520
I do not want any goddess account and ghost account.

1007
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:50,200
You have to save me from this.
If not I will say that you did everything.

1008
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,500
Do not do that.

1009
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:54,990
I was unable to tolerate just one avatar.
Do I need another?

1010
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:58,820
I cannot
- If she comes to me again then it is up to you.

1011
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,090
Can I escape from that?

1012
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:04,560
You do not reveal everything in fear. I will manage it.
- Okay.

1013
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,520
Baby Devi!
- What, sir?

1014
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:13,780
Today is my birthday.
You have to come for lunch with me.

1015
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:17,400
Okay Happy birthday, sir.
- Thank you!

1016
01:21:17,890 --> 01:21:20,050
Why me for lunch, sir?

1017
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:23,740
When your father and mother were alive, we three used to go.

1018
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:28,700
If I have lunch with you, I feel like having lunch with them, dear.

1019
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:33,270
You should not say no, please.
- Okay, sir. - Thank you!

1020
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:39,590
Nothing to fear.
Today I will get rid of the ghost which possessed Devi.

1021
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:43,070
I have settled everything.
- Sir, shall we go? - Okay, we will go.

1022
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:46,440
Naveen, my car driver did not come today.
You can come, right?

1023
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:48,510
There is a lot of work in the bank, sir.

1024
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:51,470
Sir is asking, right?
You can come, right?

1025
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,680
Why are you like that? Come.
You come, baby.

1026
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:02,800
We used to reserve this table
whenever I and your parents come here.

1027
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:03,660
Oh

1028
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:06,290
Order, sir.
- You please order, baby.

1029
01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:08,690
Sir, it is your birthday.
You have to place the order.

1030
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:10,590
No, dear. You have to give.

1031
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:12,660
Whenever we come here,
your mother used to give the order.

1032
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:13,500
Okay.

1033
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:19,980
2 chicken biryani, 2 plates chicken legs, Paya, Fish fry

1034
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:24,500
Tandoori chicken, prawns fry, Szechuan Chicken Fried Rice

1035
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:30,220
Chilli Chicken wet and that is it.
- What, baby? So many items?

1036
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:33,910
All these are for you, sir.
I am pure vegetarian.

1037
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:36,710
Boy, one veg fried rice for me.
- Okay, madam.

1038
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:40,800
Hey, Subbarao!

1039
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:46,550
He is our old customer. I will talk to him and come back soon.
- Okay, sir.

1040
01:22:53,150 --> 01:22:54,180
Come come.

1041
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:58,400
As you said, I asked her to place the order.

1042
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:59,710
Did you see how many items she ordered.

1043
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:02,880
She is very normal.
- You are not understanding.

1044
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:05,560
You no need to worry.

1045
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:08,600
How am I booked this way?
What will this mad girl do now?

1046
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,690
Mummy.. mummy!

1047
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:21,460
Why did you come here leaving her there?

1048
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:22,540
You came leaving me there, right?

1049
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:24,640
She did not order for herself.
She may eat me up.

1050
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,150
Are you talking about that girl?
- Yes.

1051
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:29,890
You are wrong.
She is perfectly normal.

1052
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:32,780
Who is he?
- He is a very famous psychiatrist.

1053
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:34,510
He will get rid of the ghost which possessed Devi.

1054
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,490
I understood one thing.
- What?

1055
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:39,070
Both of you have Paranoid phobia.

1056
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:42,690
Sir, I did not ask you to say about our diseases
but the disorder of that girl.

1057
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:47,830
That girl has nothing.
She is very very normal.

1058
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:48,830
That is it
- Come on.

1059
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:08,620
Sir, did you finish your handwash also?

1060
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:13,740
You ate very fast.
Sorry, sir. I am very slow at eating.

1061
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:16,620
Wait, I am done.
I will wash my hand and come.

1062
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:24,590
She said that all the items were ordered for us

1063
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:29,590
She ordered 10 plates, she ate everything
without leaving a single piece.

1064
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:32,170
What, doctor?
- Oh my god!

1065
01:24:32,370 --> 01:24:36,940
She is thinking that you too ate
along with her and went for handwash.

1066
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:40,470
No doubt, this is a case of multiple disorders.

1067
01:24:40,670 --> 01:24:43,410
You have to do whatever she asks.

1068
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:48,040
If not life will fall into danger. Take care.
- Okay.

1069
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:51,090
She will eat me too if I stay here. Bye!
- Doctor

1070
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:55,230
What there to, sir?
- What is there to do?

1071
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:58,320
We have to make a restaurant available always.

1072
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,490
Or else she would sprinkle
salt and pepper on you and me

1073
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:01,560
She will suck our blood.

1074
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,920
You will be fine as you are young.
But I will be tasteless.

1075
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:08,260
Sir, shall we go?
- Okay.

1076
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:38,710
Who do you think I am man?

1077
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:41,440
Who do you think, man

1078
01:25:41,610 --> 01:25:43,730
Who do you think I am?

1079
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:47,220
I am Ankamma Ankalamma

1080
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:50,580
I am Ankala Parameswari

1081
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:53,370
You bloody fellow

1082
01:25:58,030 --> 01:26:02,680
If you plan to steal the money
of mother of all the goddesses

1083
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:10,170
If you plan to take away everything
which was given to me by so many devotees

1084
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:15,360
If you are taking the gifts vowed during
struggles and offerings in front of me

1085
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:18,560
Do you think that I will just see silently

1086
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,340
You bloody fellow

1087
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:37,470
Where were you all these days

1088
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:40,920
Are you here, Julu
- Julu?

1089
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:42,590
My Julu

1090
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:45,720
My Yajulu

1091
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:49,610
My dearest Somayajulu

1092
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:55,200
Fulfill my wishes

1093
01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:00,040
Taking all my wealth

1094
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:05,760
Why are you behaving like you do not know anything

1095
01:27:07,710 --> 01:27:13,970
For you, I wore the diamond bangles
and kept jasmine flowers in my hair

1096
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:19,100
I wore the diamond bangles
and kept jasmine flowers in my hair

1097
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:22,460
For me?

1098
01:27:24,210 --> 01:27:28,640
I will drink your blood and chew your meat

1099
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:31,550
I will break your bones

1100
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,770
I will tear your ribs

1101
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:43,580
I will wrap you up and swallow you
in one gulp, you bloody fellow

1102
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:52,190
Goddess Ankalamma! Did you go again?

1103
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:56,050
I cannot tolerate this confusion, goddess.

1104
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,290
Stop this guest appearance like the ghost

1105
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:01,870
Finally, tell me what do you want me to do.

1106
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:06,210
Put all the money which you have stolen in my Hundi.
- Okay, goddess. I will put.

1107
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:08,360
Then what about my money?
- What is this?

1108
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:10,190
Tone has changed and also the place.

1109
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:17,230
Umadevi, is that you?
Tell me, where should I get that.

1110
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:18,940
Where will you give?

1111
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:21,540
Why did she start again?

1112
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:25,830
Put the money of Umadevi also in my hundi.
- Okay, goddess Okay.

1113
01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:30,450
I am accepting my mistake and
I will put all the money in your hundi.

1114
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:23,080
Hi, Devi!

1115
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:26,370
I did not expect that you would get caught so easily.

1116
01:29:33,490 --> 01:29:37,500
Jyoti, concept is super.

1117
01:29:38,110 --> 01:29:40,620
Mr Mahesh, direction was fantastic.

1118
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,840
But Ms Devi, you are the super actor.

1119
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:43,870
Is that success?

1120
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:45,440
That is surprise as it is success, right.

1121
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:48,740
Devi, thank you so much.
You made it.

1122
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:51,300
It is my duty to help the bank.

1123
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:54,610
But what you are doing is a big help to the society.

1124
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:58,420
Our meeting and this journey is very interesting.

1125
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:05,230
Mahesh.. Mahesh!

1126
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:09,110
Oh, shit! Go go fast.
- Jyoti!

1127
01:30:13,930 --> 01:30:14,760
I want to talk to you.

1128
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:18,120
Tell me how you got the data.

1129
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:19,660
Naveen

1130
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:24,770
Devi!
- Yes.

1131
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:27,100
Oh! Sorry, Devi.

1132
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:35,060
Park it and come.
- No, I have some work outside. You go.

1133
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,610
It is enough if you fill that form
and sign on it.

1134
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,410
Okay. Thank you.

1135
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:43,640
We have to tell you one thing.
- What?

1136
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:48,820
As you thought, we are not committing any fraud.
We are journalists.

1137
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:55,140
The unclaimed accounts which were left
in the bank for years have been misused.

1138
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:58,050
To prove that, we started this operation.

1139
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:01,560
If we have withdrawn the money as planned

1140
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,720
By arranging the press meet

1141
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:07,680
We thought to expose the bank employees involvement
and the fraud happening in the bank to the public.

1142
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,160
You would have told the truth when you got caught.

1143
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:13,490
Nobody could have believed if we said so.

1144
01:31:13,690 --> 01:31:16,320
And they would have thought that
we both are planning something to escape.

1145
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:20,140
Very wisely your manager trapped us
and he has withdrawn that money.

1146
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:23,040
Is that why he removed me from the data section?

1147
01:31:23,210 --> 01:31:25,510
If required you check your data
Our both accounts were closed.

1148
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:31,110
If you do this help, we can expose
the fraud that has happened.

1149
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:33,860
And the remark made on us can be cleared.

1150
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:37,180
Mainly, we can make that unclaimed accounts issue public.

1151
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:42,690
Okay. I am with you.

1152
01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:16,390
I did not expect that the manager will get caught so easily.

1153
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:17,360
It is the power of Devi.

1154
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,670
According to our plan..

1155
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:23,550
The manager will come to the temple tomorrow
at 12:12 pm and put the money in hundi.

1156
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:27,010
He said that he will accept his mistakes
in front of the goddess.

1157
01:32:27,180 --> 01:32:29,060
Everything will be recorded in the cameras
which we have set there

1158
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:31,050
It will be live telecast on TV, web and mobiles.

1159
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:33,560
So unclaimed accounts issue will be highlighted.

1160
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,730
One request from me.

1161
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:41,780
We have to book Naveen by saying that
he committed so many mistakes.

1162
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:42,790
Okay, then

1163
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:47,240
Giving you the update for every minute,
I will follow the manager and come.

1164
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:49,570
How if you come?
I mean

1165
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:53,350
As it is a live telecast,
the police will come to the bank immediately.

1166
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:58,680
So you should be there and fix Naveen - Correct.
- Yes.

1167
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,270
Then only I will get satisfied.
- All the best, Devi. - Okay.

1168
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:03,390
Update everything from time to time.
- Okay.

1169
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:04,780
Jyo!
- Yes.

1170
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:06,920
Book two tickets to Dubai immediately.

1171
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:16,540
Razak Bhai! I am sending 3 crores.
That should be delivered in Dubai.

1172
01:33:33,270 --> 01:33:36,080
Mata! Bless me, goddess.

1173
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:44,400
Mata Sharanam Sharanam Mata

1174
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:47,870
Sir!
- Not sir Mata

1175
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,140
Mata?
- Yes, Mata.

1176
01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:53,070
This is the Ankalamma Maala.

1177
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:56,450
All our problems will get solved by today, Mata.

1178
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:59,490
The goddess appeared in my dream and said that

1179
01:33:59,690 --> 01:34:02,480
If we put all the money
which was stolen from her in Hundi

1180
01:34:02,610 --> 01:34:04,330
She will forgive and leave us, Mata.

1181
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:06,280
Then what about me?
- She said that also.

1182
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:09,380
Umadevi who is torturing you is the devotee
of that goddess it seems.

1183
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:13,800
So she said if we put even that money
in hundi, she will also forgive you, Mata.

1184
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,270
Then, will you give it?
- You do not worry, Mata.

1185
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,850
I took this oath to end up this, right?

1186
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:22,290
Mata!
- Sir

1187
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:26,970
Mata, I took the oath.
Everything will happen as you thought.

1188
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:31,270
About what, sir?
- It is that that.

1189
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,880
Mahesh, they have come.

1190
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,800
Mr Mahesh! They have come.
- Okay.

1191
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:31,300
Where are you?
- I am at the temple.

1192
01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:34,500
Okay Okay.

1193
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:02,630
Mata.. mata.. mata

1194
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:08,090
Mahesh, some thieves have entered the bank.

1195
01:36:08,290 --> 01:36:09,030
How can the thieves enter?

1196
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:14,990
Mr Mahesh, some robbers entered the bank.

1197
01:36:15,190 --> 01:36:17,440
I know.. I know.
- How do you know?

1198
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:24,460
Oh god! Did you find the time
only today to do the robbery?

1199
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:33,010
Sir Police sir!

1200
01:36:35,010 --> 01:36:37,190
Police?
- Police?

1201
01:36:37,890 --> 01:36:39,600
Sir!
- How come you are here?

1202
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,530
Here I am doing the job, sir.
- Sir! - You too?

1203
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:44,240
Are you both working here?
- Yes, sir. How come you are here?

1204
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:47,280
As your manager requested me, I came on a mock drill to this bank.
- Okay, sir.

1205
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:48,650
If some thieves attack suddenly

1206
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:50,380
Hey, what?
- Nothing, sir.

1207
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:52,330
Disturbing in between.
Be there.

1208
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,440
Where am I?
- Thieves, sir Thieves

1209
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:59,600
Mock drill is to educate the customers and staff
how to react when some thieves attack suddenly.

1210
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:00,250
Oh!

1211
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:10,370
Mata.. mata.. mata

1212
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:20,650
Mahesh

1213
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:24,950
Mahesh!

1214
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,670
Why are you holding me?
Leave me.

1215
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:03,320
Sir, the thieves have entered
the Janata Bank main branch.

1216
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:04,220
Come immediately, sir.

1217
01:38:08,390 --> 01:38:10,660
Jyoti! Where is the suitcase?

1218
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:15,120
Hey, bring him here.

1219
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:26,620
What? What is this, man?
You came selecting a bad time

1220
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,530
Did you find the time only today to do your duty?

1221
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:32,050
Do you know at whom you are pointing the gun?

1222
01:38:32,330 --> 01:38:33,850
At a goddess, man.

1223
01:38:35,090 --> 01:38:36,660
Where? Ask your goddess to come.

1224
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:37,680
Ask your goddess to come.

1225
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:40,080
Why are you staring silently still?

1226
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:43,000
Come at least to save your money, goddess. Come!

1227
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:47,710
Will you come and torture me if I am alone?

1228
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:48,860
Will not you come if there are so many?

1229
01:38:50,650 --> 01:38:53,170
Goddess might not come from this Devi

1230
01:38:53,370 --> 01:38:57,760
But to save her money, that goddess will come.

1231
01:38:58,180 --> 01:38:59,700
I will make her come.

1232
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:18,390
Come dear Mahalakshmi Come here

1233
01:39:18,540 --> 01:39:24,570
Come dear Mahalakshmi Come here

1234
01:39:24,710 --> 01:39:31,060
You can cleanse the sins in our bank and go

1235
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:40,590
You can cleanse the sins
in our bank and go, queen of money

1236
01:39:40,790 --> 01:39:49,590
Come dear Mahalakshmi Come here

1237
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:55,480
Will the goddess come if I call her so softly?

1238
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:56,690
How can she come?

1239
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:07,850
Goddess Mahalakshmi, come here
Come on, Goddess Vijaya Lakshmi

1240
01:40:08,030 --> 01:40:11,870
Goddess Varalakshmi, come here
and close the account, please

1241
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:17,270
Goddess Mahalakshmi, come here
Come on, Goddess Vijaya Lakshmi

1242
01:40:17,470 --> 01:40:21,000
Goddess Varalakshmi, come here
and close the account, please

1243
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:24,760
Bash up one by one and bury under the earth

1244
01:40:24,910 --> 01:40:28,480
Send them to the jail and break their bones

1245
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:32,840
Oh dear goddess, show us your divine self

1246
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:36,800
Goddess Lakshmi, show your divine self

1247
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:40,950
What, goddess?
Is this not enough?

1248
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:42,410
Oh gosh!

1249
01:40:42,610 --> 01:40:45,640
Then, even by garlanding you, paying salutation
and chanting your mantras

1250
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,360
I will please you.
I will not leave you.

1251
01:40:54,890 --> 01:40:57,260
Sri Lakshmi, Jaya Lakshmi, Bhulakshmi
Golakshmi

1252
01:40:57,410 --> 01:40:58,630
That Lakshmi, this Lakshmi

1253
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:01,000
You might be any Lakshmi

1254
01:41:02,110 --> 01:41:04,990
I worshipped you, prayed to you,
chanting your name, servicing you

1255
01:41:05,190 --> 01:41:10,360
I kept your savings balance safely in the locker

1256
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:17,350
By killing the convicts who have stolen
the money, protect your money

1257
01:41:17,550 --> 01:41:20,400
Creating tsunami, earthquakes

1258
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:24,100
Come to write the chapter of destruction

1259
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:30,880
Come on.. come on.. come on

1260
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,680
Mata

1261
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,640
Will the priest also there in the locker room
along with the goddess?

1262
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:28,220
Mata! Pleased by my prayers

1263
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:32,060
Did you come from the earth and
appeared in this avatar, Mata?

1264
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:35,610
Is he the priest or mad person?
- I am blessed, Mata I am blessed.

1265
01:42:37,410 --> 01:42:41,280
Mata! Lit up this with that, Mata.
I will give you arti.

1266
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:44,950
Sri Lakshmi, Dhilakshmi, Bhulakshmi, Golakshmi
- Shut up!

1267
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:50,200
Did I come to the bank or to a mental hospital?

1268
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,860
You came to the bank, Mata.

1269
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:55,130
Then, where is the locker room?
- Lockers are there.

1270
01:42:55,330 --> 01:42:57,560
But your money is outside.
- Outside?

1271
01:42:58,680 --> 01:42:59,450
Go, Mata.

1272
01:43:00,050 --> 01:43:03,500
Burn those convicts with this and take away your money.

1273
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:06,060
Take your positions.
- Oh, police

1274
01:43:09,030 --> 01:43:10,330
Jyoti, come on move.

1275
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:12,850
Come on!

1276
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:22,690
Sir, I am the one who called you about
the thieves entering the bank.

1277
01:43:22,870 --> 01:43:23,430
Okay.

1278
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:25,020
Hey, take them away.

1279
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:32,270
You want a light for your face!

1280
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:35,870
Did you start the robbery in the banks leaving the ATMs?

1281
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:38,790
From where did you start digging?
- Charminar.

1282
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:41,340
Are you single?
Or is there anyone else?

1283
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:46,300
Only pigs come as a group, lion comes all alone

1284
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:50,730
No multi-star, only single star.

1285
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:55,020
That is this Burning Star!

1286
01:43:56,010 --> 01:43:58,330
Are you injured severely?
- Yes. - Oh, no

1287
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:01,860
It will heal very soon.
- Okay.

1288
01:44:05,570 --> 01:44:07,230
Is it paining?
- Yes.

1289
01:44:09,030 --> 01:44:11,070
Enough blowing at that, you can do it later.

1290
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:15,100
Do not know where the money of
the goddess has gone during the fight, boy.

1291
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:18,160
Sir, I have concealed that carefully.
- Concealed? - Yes, sir.

1292
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:20,730
Where?
- There, sir. Come.

1293
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:22,560
Baby, you too come.

1294
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:33,150
My dearest Mata!

1295
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:36,830
This year, you are the best employee of the year.
- Thank you, sir.

1296
01:44:41,980 --> 01:44:44,770
I have to go to the temple immediately
and put this money in hundi.

1297
01:44:44,970 --> 01:44:46,080
Goddess Lakshmi has a count, right?

1298
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:48,930
Money rained at Jubilee Hills Road No. 36

1299
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:51,860
In the accident took place at Peddamma Temple, Jubilee Hills

1300
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:55,990
Water tanker hits the car which has been driven
by Somayajulu, manager of Janata Bank.

1301
01:44:56,190 --> 01:44:58,450
Crores of rupees spilt out of the car

1302
01:44:58,650 --> 01:45:02,270
Identified as the money that belongs
to the unclaimed accounts scam.

1303
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:07,640
While the old criminals Mahesh and Jyoti who planned
this scam tried to escape by threatening with weapons

1304
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:12,290
Encounter specialist Brahmaji chased them
and arrested them at Charminar area.

1305
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:17,340
Cannot you stay without smoking?

1306
01:45:18,210 --> 01:45:18,760
Here

1307
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:24,840
I have many doubts about
the incident happened in the bank.

1308
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,610
Everything was like a miracle.

1309
01:45:29,710 --> 01:45:32,550
Why did Mahesh and Jyoti who were supposed
to be at the temple come to the bank?

1310
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,990
Mock drill officer has come correctly at that time.

1311
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:38,360
That thief is another one in the climax.

1312
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:50,360
You know everything, right?
- Yes.

1313
01:45:50,910 --> 01:45:52,960
I saw you going to Mahesh.

1314
01:45:54,990 --> 01:45:56,810
What the work she has outside
during bank working hours?

1315
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:05,170
I heard everything what you discussed.

1316
01:46:15,390 --> 01:46:18,360
You will not understand whatever I say at that time.

1317
01:46:19,780 --> 01:46:22,250
I have set the mock drill officer to arrive.

1318
01:46:22,790 --> 01:46:25,840
Hello, it is me the manager of
Janata Bank Somayajulu speaking.

1319
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:28,080
You have to come to our bank and conduct a mock drill.

1320
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:31,160
As your manager requested me,
I came on a mock drill to this bank.

1321
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,280
Then what about that thief?

1322
01:46:34,370 --> 01:46:35,800
I do not know who he is.
