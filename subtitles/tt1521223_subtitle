1
00:00:00,304 --> 00:00:05,264
ITI MRINALINI

2
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,318
This...

3
00:01:23,454 --> 00:01:25,319
...is my last night.

4
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:30,559
I am ending my life of my own free will.

5
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,691
I have no grievances...

6
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,292
...no accusations against anyone.

7
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,663
But wait... is that the truth?

8
00:01:42,673 --> 00:01:47,406
...or must we cling to our pretenses
till the very end?

9
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:56,604
At me tugs night's sleepless river

10
00:01:56,604 --> 00:01:59,721
At me tugs night's sleepless river

11
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,385
At me tugs the secret dark

12
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:07,294
Breaks my sleep and opens wide

13
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:10,423
The bolted doors of sightless night.

14
00:02:13,704 --> 00:02:17,538
Torn clouds in the vWind; around the moon

15
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:21,339
Suddenly gather blue crystals of time

16
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,414
I come out of doors to a deserted earth

17
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:27,676
And roadways seemingly
filled with sky...

18
00:02:31,522 --> 00:02:35,288
The first call came in primal boyhood

19
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,360
On a maddening day of aches

20
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:41,693
Bugles of battle rang through my flesh

21
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,632
Then my dreams were first unchained.

22
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:50,431
At me tugs...

23
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:54,404
...night's sleepless river

24
00:02:57,581 --> 00:03:01,278
All rules, all duties ring hollow

25
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:04,582
Familiar roads turn labrynthine

26
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:08,351
My beguiled eyes touch far horizons

27
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:14,488
All barriers false have been cut down!

28
00:03:15,332 --> 00:03:18,426
At me tugs...

29
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:21,695
...night's sleepless river

30
00:03:31,682 --> 00:03:32,444
Meenu...

31
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:34,347
Which one?

32
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:40,483
The one on the left.

33
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:45,595
Now look at these two...

34
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:49,432
Nah... the earlier one.

35
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:52,561
But I feel...

36
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:54,663
...this one's the best!

37
00:03:55,306 --> 00:03:55,533
Oh no!

38
00:03:55,573 --> 00:03:56,631
Look what you've done Imtiaz!

39
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:59,301
Smudged it all!
Honestly, you're the limit!

40
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:01,308
Really? Let's see?

41
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,468
No! Let go!

42
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,512
Come, let me do it-

43
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:06,514
No! No! Let go! Please!

44
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,708
I'm very ticklish!

45
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:12,687
Now I've got to do it all over again!

46
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:16,585
Guess what's my next film?

47
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:17,694
Don't know.

48
00:04:19,363 --> 00:04:21,490
Make a guess! I've even got funding!

49
00:04:21,632 --> 00:04:22,621
You tell me.

50
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,359
I'm not in the mood for guessing games.

51
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:33,399
You stir my soul with your call...

52
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:37,307
Oh my waker of sorrows!

53
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:40,644
For you I shall sing my song...

54
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:42,442
The Red Oleander?

55
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:45,312
Bishu, my madcap...

56
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:47,287
...you call me your waker of sorrows?

57
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:48,649
Of course!

58
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:52,726
You are my messenger
from unknown shores...

59
00:04:53,297 --> 00:04:54,525
When you arrived in this dark kingdom...

60
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:57,429
...a salty ocean breeze
came and buffeted my heart.

61
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:58,533
Good Lord!

62
00:04:58,636 --> 00:04:59,694
What exactly are you planning?

63
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:01,736
Not asking me to play Nandini, are you?

64
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:06,440
You're nuts, Imtiaz!

65
00:05:06,544 --> 00:05:08,512
What will you do
if I actually say 'yes'?

66
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:09,703
I want you to say yes!

67
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:12,608
Impossible Imtiaz!

68
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:14,548
Nandini? At my age!

69
00:05:15,386 --> 00:05:16,751
She is a metaphor for youth!

70
00:05:17,688 --> 00:05:18,518
Remember...

71
00:05:18,722 --> 00:05:20,690
Her sari's the colour of paddy...

72
00:05:21,358 --> 00:05:22,723
...she wears earrings
of red oleander?

73
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:26,690
What exactly does Tagore mean by
'colour of paddy'?

74
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:30,364
Green of young paddy plants.
Or yellow of ripened stalks?

75
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:32,660
I've never been able
to figure that out somehow...

76
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:38,439
Nandini...

77
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:51,686
Like you!

78
00:05:52,323 --> 00:05:52,721
Like me?

79
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:58,386
Why didn't you come earlier, Imtiaz?

80
00:05:59,363 --> 00:06:02,332
When I was young enough to play Nandini?

81
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,527
Born at the wrong time!

82
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:11,398
So many people will be there!

83
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,540
It's a premiere after all!

84
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:15,608
They'll all be dressed to kill!

85
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,371
And you?
Going in an ordinary cotton sari!

86
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:20,707
What will people say?

87
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,315
They'll say:

88
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:27,423
Look! Her sari's the colour of paddy...

89
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:29,556
...and she has red oleanders
at her ears!

90
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:51,313
Meenu-di

91
00:06:51,448 --> 00:06:52,574
Welcome! Welcome!

92
00:06:57,621 --> 00:06:59,486
You were wonderful in this film!

93
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:00,512
Fantastic! Really!

94
00:07:00,624 --> 00:07:01,556
How've you been, Meenu-di

95
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:02,556
Very well.

96
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,620
How lovely you look!

97
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,455
You always dress
differently from everyone else!

98
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,323
How do you do it?

99
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:12,401
Look at me! I'm getting old already!

100
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,431
Nonsense! You look so pretty!

101
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,628
Our... er...

102
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,633
...director isn't here?

103
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:19,472
Here I am!

104
00:07:19,677 --> 00:07:20,439
There!

105
00:07:21,512 --> 00:07:21,739
Here she is!

106
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:23,508
My...

107
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:26,381
...Kunti!

108
00:07:32,323 --> 00:07:33,654
Stop! Don't push!

109
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,553
Excuse me! Excuse me!

110
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:36,717
Let us pass please...

111
00:07:38,562 --> 00:07:39,586
Ah! Here's Hiyaa!

112
00:07:47,738 --> 00:07:49,262
My!

113
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:52,341
She's all dolled up!

114
00:07:53,377 --> 00:07:55,402
Trying to compete with you!

115
00:08:30,614 --> 00:08:32,309
Do you see now?

116
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:34,417
Why I wanted you and no one else?

117
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,511
You were right. I'm glad you insisted.

118
00:08:39,323 --> 00:08:40,654
The film worked out rather well...

119
00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:50,625
We are good together!
- You've started again!

120
00:08:58,442 --> 00:08:59,636
You talk far too much!

121
00:09:01,678 --> 00:09:04,374
Supposing someone vWere to see us?

122
00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:00,633
I'll just be a minute!

123
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:07,502
Meenu-di

124
00:10:07,744 --> 00:10:09,302
You're here?

125
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:10,710
Everyone's looking for you outside!

126
00:10:13,317 --> 00:10:14,409
That's why I ran avWay!

127
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:16,347
You look tired!

128
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:17,520
Not well?

129
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:19,351
No... er...

130
00:10:20,357 --> 00:10:22,382
There's such a crowd out there...

131
00:10:23,594 --> 00:10:24,618
Call that a crowd?

132
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:26,762
Then vWhat vWill you do
at the unit party after this?

133
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:29,623
The whole film industry will be there!

134
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:33,335
I'm thinking of skipping that too...

135
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,728
What're you saying!

136
00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:37,597
You're the star of the evening!

137
00:10:38,675 --> 00:10:40,336
If you don't come...

138
00:10:40,544 --> 00:10:41,442
Tch!

139
00:10:41,512 --> 00:10:43,707
Your eye make-up has smudged!

140
00:10:45,516 --> 00:10:46,710
May I?

141
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:47,713
Yes... I...

142
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:50,308
I'll fix it...

143
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,391
Really Meenu-di!

144
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:05,729
How gorgeous you look still!

145
00:11:06,436 --> 00:11:07,334
Thank you!

146
00:11:07,638 --> 00:11:08,730
You're very lovely yourself!

147
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,701
And you've done a great job
in this film!

148
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:14,301
My goodness!

149
00:11:14,411 --> 00:11:16,470
Sharing screen space with you was scary!

150
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:18,709
I used to be a huge fan of yours!

151
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,383
Used to be?

152
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:21,609
Not any longer?

153
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:28,381
Did you know Hiyaa would
this good in Draupadi's role?

154
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,563
The entire credit goes to Imtiaz-da!

155
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:33,723
Not at all!

156
00:11:34,331 --> 00:11:36,697
Hiyaa vWorked very hard herself.
I knew she'd do it!

157
00:11:39,469 --> 00:11:42,438
So are we seeing Hiyaa again
soon in one of your films?

158
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:43,597
Absolutely!

159
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,370
Very soon!

160
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:50,308
This is a very joyous evening...

161
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:54,644
Salil- babu your film
'Born Of The Sun' opens today...

162
00:11:55,385 --> 00:11:58,320
All our journalist friends
are present here today...

163
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:01,355
May I make a short announcement here?

164
00:12:01,491 --> 00:12:03,516
Of course! Of course! Please -

165
00:12:03,627 --> 00:12:05,356
It gives me great pleasure to...

166
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:13,501
It gives me great pleasure to announce
our new venture from Spotlight Films!

167
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:15,362
On the 1st day of the Bengali NevW Year!

168
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:16,471
The name of the film:

169
00:12:16,673 --> 00:12:18,265
The Red Oleander!

170
00:12:18,408 --> 00:12:18,737
To be directed by:

171
00:12:19,576 --> 00:12:21,373
Imtiaz Chaudhury!

172
00:12:22,613 --> 00:12:23,580
And...

173
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,614
...the central role of
Nandini will be played by:

174
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:28,475
Hiyaa Majumdar!

175
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:30,610
Superb casting! Fabulous!

176
00:12:36,393 --> 00:12:38,691
The first lesson of an actor's life:

177
00:12:39,363 --> 00:12:40,387
Timing!

178
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:45,333
The perfect moment
of entry and exit on stage!

179
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:50,702
The moment of entry
was not in my hands...

180
00:12:51,742 --> 00:12:53,573
...but the exit can surely be?

181
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:56,307
In this chancy life of ours...

182
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:58,606
...let this one thing
be vWithin my control.

183
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:55,328
Oh! It's you ma'am!

184
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,635
But the party's upstairs.
In the Banquet Hall...

185
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:01,700
I know.

186
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:04,409
I've been there.

187
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:06,475
Actually...

188
00:14:06,717 --> 00:14:08,344
...this darkness...

189
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:10,315
...I find it soothing.

190
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,316
Why? Is there a problem?

191
00:14:13,623 --> 00:14:14,749
Not at all, ma'am!

192
00:14:15,392 --> 00:14:17,485
No problem at all.
Please sit wherever you wish...

193
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:19,555
What can I get you?

194
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:29,264
Would you like me to get you anything?

195
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:31,571
No... nothing right now.

196
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:19,310
You're here!

197
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:20,651
And we were looking for you upstairs!

198
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:23,619
But I had gone upstairs.

199
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:25,550
It's you who was not there.

200
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:26,323
Strange!

201
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
How come we didn't see you?

202
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:28,360
We?

203
00:15:28,498 --> 00:15:29,726
Who's 'vWe' Imtiaz?

204
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,692
You and Hiyaa?

205
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:37,735
We meaning... all of us!
The cast, the crew... everyone!

206
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:39,702
Come on now!

207
00:15:40,277 --> 00:15:42,370
They're all waiting for
you at the cast party...

208
00:15:42,412 --> 00:15:44,380
Cast party for which film, Imtiaz?

209
00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:46,573
The Red Oleander?

210
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:48,373
That's what it seemed like...

211
00:15:48,618 --> 00:15:51,519
...seeing you and
your heroine at the bar window!

212
00:15:59,563 --> 00:16:02,293
Am I really needed there?

213
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:06,527
You know how it is!

214
00:16:07,404 --> 00:16:09,668
All decisions don't
lie with the director!

215
00:16:13,677 --> 00:16:17,374
Probably it's true that
Nandini does need a fresh face.

216
00:16:17,714 --> 00:16:19,545
You said so yourself!

217
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:21,512
That's what the producers feel too...

218
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:23,414
And... regarding...

219
00:16:23,753 --> 00:16:25,516
...this thing about casting Hiyaa...

220
00:16:25,722 --> 00:16:27,349
...I would've told you myself
sooner or later. But...

221
00:16:27,491 --> 00:16:29,459
...but about this sudden announcement...

222
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:30,615
I didn't have a clue!

223
00:16:54,284 --> 00:16:57,378
At me tugs night's sleepless river

224
00:16:58,722 --> 00:17:01,657
At me tugs the mysterious dark

225
00:17:03,393 --> 00:17:04,655
Breaks my sleep...

226
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,497
...breaks my... sleep...

227
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,693
...breaks my sleep...

228
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:20,574
For Minu...

229
00:17:21,545 --> 00:17:23,672
in our City of Memories...

230
00:17:24,614 --> 00:17:25,478
Abhi

231
00:17:25,749 --> 00:17:28,616
Breaks my sleep and opens wide

232
00:17:28,718 --> 00:17:31,346
The bolted doors of sightless night...

233
00:17:31,454 --> 00:17:34,321
Torn clouds in the vWind; around the moon

234
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:36,392
Suddenly gather blue crystals of time

235
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:38,551
I come out of doors to a deserted earth

236
00:17:38,662 --> 00:17:40,562
And roadways seemingly
filled with sky...

237
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:41,688
You bourgeois!

238
00:17:42,332 --> 00:17:43,663
And you call yourself a revolutionary!

239
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:46,693
Recite Mayakovsky from memory
and then we'll talk!

240
00:17:46,736 --> 00:17:47,668
Yes, come on!

241
00:17:47,737 --> 00:17:48,601
Hey, pass me a fag!

242
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,470
Just listen to him!

243
00:17:54,578 --> 00:17:56,307
Sounds like a Russian agent!

244
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:56,674
Exactly!

245
00:17:57,581 --> 00:17:59,606
What does Mayakovsky know
of nights in Kolkata?

246
00:17:59,716 --> 00:18:01,308
And you do?

247
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:02,682
Remember those lines?

248
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:04,546
They give me goose bumps!

249
00:18:05,689 --> 00:18:08,385
A naked Shiva rules the roads...

250
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:10,550
...in baritone sings a glorious song

251
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:14,721
Whatever you say,
the images of the city...

252
00:18:15,498 --> 00:18:17,329
...are best in Shakti's poems!

253
00:18:17,534 --> 00:18:18,626
Yes, that's true!

254
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:22,405
From head to foot a crazy swaying...

255
00:18:22,472 --> 00:18:23,404
...walls merge into walls.

256
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,566
Corniches into corniches...

257
00:18:24,641 --> 00:18:27,474
...footpaths change underfoot
at dead of night!

258
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:36,714
Done?

259
00:18:38,455 --> 00:18:39,444
Remember! Tonight!

260
00:18:40,657 --> 00:18:43,421
You know what,
I've got an offer for a film!

261
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:45,553
From Siddhartha Sarkar

262
00:18:46,396 --> 00:18:46,691
No!

263
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:50,594
You...

264
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:52,333
Honest!

265
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:55,502
He sent his assistant across last night.

266
00:18:55,705 --> 00:18:57,673
Apparently he'd seen me
in a play...

267
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:00,466
You're going to act in
a Siddhartha Sarkar film?

268
00:19:01,478 --> 00:19:03,639
You of all people!

269
00:19:05,548 --> 00:19:08,312
Oh sorry! Not film! They call it
'picture' don't they?

270
00:19:08,518 --> 00:19:10,679
What a snob you are!

271
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:15,358
Name another director
as successful as he!

272
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,323
Don't say successful!

273
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,620
There can be many kinds of success!

274
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:20,525
You mean commercially successful!

275
00:19:20,697 --> 00:19:22,631
If only he wasn't so pretentious!

276
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:26,733
Behaves like he's churning
out one masterpiece after another!

277
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:28,597
Well, I hardly have a choice!

278
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:33,632
I wasn't exactly wooed by
the likes of Ray, Mrinal Sen & Ghatak!

279
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:36,306
Why films anyway?

280
00:19:36,446 --> 00:19:38,607
You're a good student. Finish college
and go for higher studies!

281
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:42,280
Actually...

282
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:44,746
I can't stand that house any longer.

283
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:48,591
Yes. Yes!

284
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:50,523
It's always we who use up the water!

285
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:52,390
It starts flowing at 5 in the morning.

286
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:53,589
Why don't you fill the tanks then?

287
00:19:53,663 --> 00:19:54,459
Indeed!

288
00:19:54,564 --> 00:19:57,397
I wake up at the crack
of dawn to fill the tanks...

289
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,698
...and you'll wake up leisurely
to do your morning jobs!

290
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:04,363
What! What did you say?

291
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:06,407
Stop fighting, you two!

292
00:20:06,543 --> 00:20:08,374
The same routine every morning!

293
00:20:12,682 --> 00:20:13,706
Where will you go?

294
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:15,279
Don't know...

295
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:16,713
...even a small place would do.

296
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:19,552
I'd do it up the way I want.

297
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:23,324
There'd be plenty of light
and fresh air...

298
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:25,420
Ma won't come I'm sure.

299
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:28,425
She'll stay on in that awful
hole clinging to my father's memory!

300
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:33,328
And what'll you do?

301
00:20:33,737 --> 00:20:35,466
Become a filmstar?

302
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:37,562
Maybe...

303
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:40,268
I used to think...

304
00:20:40,443 --> 00:20:41,375
I'd be a novelist...

305
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:42,669
or perhaps a poet...

306
00:20:43,713 --> 00:20:44,680
but now?

307
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:46,547
Let's see...

308
00:20:47,584 --> 00:20:49,484
I feel bad for my brother.

309
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,287
Poor chap!

310
00:20:51,454 --> 00:20:52,546
No escaping us, even in Canada!

311
00:20:53,623 --> 00:20:56,490
Has to take care of all our expenses!

312
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,487
Works overtime every day!

313
00:21:00,396 --> 00:21:03,422
Hardly has time for
his graduate studies.

314
00:21:04,634 --> 00:21:05,532
No Abhi.

315
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:08,333
I have to start earning now...

316
00:21:08,438 --> 00:21:09,530
Or else, get married!

317
00:21:11,474 --> 00:21:12,634
So get married!

318
00:21:13,543 --> 00:21:14,532
Who's stopping you?

319
00:21:15,612 --> 00:21:16,476
To whom?

320
00:21:17,447 --> 00:21:18,641
Can't depend on you!

321
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:20,507
For one thing, you're a Naxalite...

322
00:21:20,617 --> 00:21:22,551
...besides,
the police have their eye on you!

323
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:26,512
What choice do I have
except the silver screen?

324
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:32,359
So after all those heated discussions on
Bergman. Truffaut and Godard...

325
00:21:32,562 --> 00:21:34,393
...you end up with Siddhartha Sarkar!

326
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,362
What a fall!

327
00:21:40,303 --> 00:21:42,498
He's filming a reputed novel, however!
Rajani.

328
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:44,300
A blind girl's role
in my very first film!

329
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,338
Who knovWs...

330
00:21:45,475 --> 00:21:47,568
Might end up winning an award!

331
00:21:49,712 --> 00:21:53,307
Your brother keeps asking you
to join him in Toronto.

332
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,572
Why don't you do that?

333
00:21:55,385 --> 00:21:56,317
You're a bourgeois anyway...

334
00:21:56,653 --> 00:21:58,678
...you won't have any problems
in a capitalist country!

335
00:21:59,722 --> 00:22:01,622
Take your mother with you and go!

336
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,652
Ma'll never leave that house!

337
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:04,724
I told you...

338
00:22:05,562 --> 00:22:07,757
Anyway, better for her not to go
to Canada right now!

339
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:09,294
Why?

340
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:11,529
Dada...

341
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:13,299
well...

342
00:22:13,536 --> 00:22:15,436
Dada's living with someone.

343
00:22:15,672 --> 00:22:17,299
Not married though!

344
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:18,602
Julia.

345
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:20,376
A German girl.

346
00:22:20,577 --> 00:22:21,635
They haven't told Ma yet.

347
00:22:22,445 --> 00:22:23,707
They'll tell her only
after they're married.

348
00:22:24,547 --> 00:22:26,708
She's so rigid about marriage
and stuff like that!

349
00:22:29,452 --> 00:22:31,613
Can you blame her
after her ovWn experience?

350
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:36,358
Well, it's true Baba
didn't marry her legally...

351
00:22:36,593 --> 00:22:38,458
...there vWas just
a temple ceremony...

352
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:40,322
Ma's never been
able to live that down!

353
00:22:40,597 --> 00:22:43,623
She thinks he could never have left us
if the marriage had been registered!

354
00:22:45,335 --> 00:22:47,565
As if that ever stopped a divorce!

355
00:22:48,471 --> 00:22:49,369
As if you don't know...

356
00:22:50,273 --> 00:22:51,672
...why I don't want to leave Kolkata!

357
00:22:52,642 --> 00:22:53,540
Swear by me!

358
00:22:58,748 --> 00:22:59,578
Shhh!

359
00:23:00,316 --> 00:23:00,680
What if someone hears us?

360
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:03,650
The fish?

361
00:23:05,455 --> 00:23:05,682
Oh right!

362
00:23:06,623 --> 00:23:08,454
I keep forgetting!

363
00:23:08,758 --> 00:23:10,589
What luck that your Aunt
went off on a pilgrimage!

364
00:23:11,594 --> 00:23:12,526
Listen!

365
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:15,391
Weren't you supposed
to feed the fish?

366
00:23:15,598 --> 00:23:16,428
Have you?

367
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:17,631
I will. Tomorrow.

368
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:19,595
Now will you please
shut up for a bit?

369
00:23:20,403 --> 00:23:22,337
Must you always feel responsible
for everything?

370
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:26,539
What?

371
00:23:27,443 --> 00:23:29,411
Just close your eyes and try to
feel a bit passionate!

372
00:23:29,512 --> 00:23:31,343
Like the heroines you see in films!

373
00:23:31,614 --> 00:23:32,342
Okay...

374
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:39,679
Now what?

375
00:23:41,391 --> 00:23:43,621
Supposing your aunt returns
and finds the fish all dead?

376
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,458
What'll you say?

377
00:23:45,762 --> 00:23:47,389
Actually...

378
00:23:47,563 --> 00:23:50,498
...you see Auntie, I'd brought
this girl over and...

379
00:23:54,604 --> 00:23:55,468
What?

380
00:23:56,673 --> 00:23:57,605
What's the matter Abhi?

381
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,672
Are you mad at me?

382
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,468
I promise I vWon't say another word!

383
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:08,414
Hear the dogs barking?

384
00:24:10,453 --> 00:24:11,351
Let them.

385
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:15,588
Quick Meenu!

386
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,423
You have to go!
Slip out by the back door...

387
00:24:20,296 --> 00:24:20,591
Hurry!

388
00:24:20,663 --> 00:24:22,494
Are you mad? I'm not leaving you!

389
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:26,465
Open the door!

390
00:24:26,602 --> 00:24:27,500
Police! Open up!

391
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:29,301
Hurry Meenu!

392
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:32,472
I'm going to try and escape
from the terrace. Go!

393
00:24:32,642 --> 00:24:33,506
Hurry Meenu!

394
00:25:08,478 --> 00:25:09,706
No one is responsible for my death...

395
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,672
...except me.

396
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:16,408
I have taken a conscious decision
to end my life.

397
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,487
I don't feel the need to
explain my action to any one.

398
00:25:26,462 --> 00:25:30,330
I am leaving everything
I own to my employees.

399
00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:33,534
Only my books of poetry...

400
00:25:34,303 --> 00:25:35,600
...and my beloved Begum...

401
00:25:36,672 --> 00:25:41,735
...should be sent to my friend
Chintan Nair...

402
00:25:43,346 --> 00:25:45,337
...at his home in Auroville, Pondicheri.

403
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:51,649
His card is attached herewith.

404
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,552
I am donating my body to
The Medical College.

405
00:26:01,631 --> 00:26:04,327
If there is indeed such
a thing as a soul...

406
00:26:04,734 --> 00:26:10,673
...mine would be at peace if my body
were used for medical research.

407
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:12,403
Sincerely.

408
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:13,531
Mrinalini.

409
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,408
Didi.

410
00:26:18,748 --> 00:26:20,409
Should I warm up your dinner novW?

411
00:26:21,617 --> 00:26:23,312
Oh! You haven't left as yet?

412
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:24,649
Why?

413
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:28,490
You shouldn't have waited so long!

414
00:26:30,326 --> 00:26:30,758
No...

415
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:33,426
I don't want any dinner
so late at night...

416
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,524
Not feeling so good anyway...

417
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,631
Well... I've made your bed.

418
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:40,629
Should I go now?

419
00:26:41,604 --> 00:26:42,536
But...

420
00:26:43,372 --> 00:26:44,600
you said you're not feeling well?

421
00:26:45,341 --> 00:26:46,535
Should I stay back tonight?

422
00:26:46,642 --> 00:26:47,666
No, it's not that serious.

423
00:26:48,578 --> 00:26:49,670
And listen...

424
00:26:50,613 --> 00:26:51,739
I'd like to...

425
00:26:52,648 --> 00:26:54,548
...sleep till late tomorrow.

426
00:26:55,718 --> 00:26:57,583
If there are any calls for me... or...

427
00:26:58,354 --> 00:26:59,616
...if my manager asks for me...

428
00:27:00,323 --> 00:27:02,450
...say I'm not well
and shouldn't be called.

429
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:07,296
Okay. Goodnight then...

430
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:12,528
Moti

431
00:27:12,735 --> 00:27:13,565
Yes, madam?

432
00:27:14,337 --> 00:27:15,634
Bring me a bottle of water please.

433
00:27:16,405 --> 00:27:16,666
Chilled?

434
00:27:18,508 --> 00:27:19,634
Yes... chilled.

435
00:27:32,355 --> 00:27:32,650
Chintan

436
00:27:40,663 --> 00:27:41,391
Madam

437
00:27:41,697 --> 00:27:43,426
If you don't feel well at night...

438
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:45,591
...just give me a call
and I'll come up.

439
00:27:47,737 --> 00:27:48,635
I'll be off then?

440
00:27:49,572 --> 00:27:50,436
Okay...

441
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:06,645
You said nothing is
within our control...

442
00:28:53,302 --> 00:28:54,428
now that in The Red Oleander...

443
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,368
you've been replaced
by Hiya Majumdar...

444
00:29:04,547 --> 00:29:05,673
For shame, Suresh babu!

445
00:29:07,316 --> 00:29:07,611
For shame!

446
00:29:08,317 --> 00:29:11,309
I had never dreamt that
you could sink so low!

447
00:29:11,654 --> 00:29:14,623
You took advantage of
your friend's illness and...

448
00:29:15,758 --> 00:29:18,750
...made this outrageous proposal.
How could you!

449
00:29:20,396 --> 00:29:21,363
Did you imagine...

450
00:29:22,598 --> 00:29:25,362
...that we Brahmo vWomen
have no self-respect?

451
00:29:27,503 --> 00:29:28,595
In our community...

452
00:29:28,738 --> 00:29:30,729
ideas of feminine virtue...

453
00:29:31,674 --> 00:29:33,574
...are different from yours?

454
00:29:49,425 --> 00:29:50,449
Ranu-di...

455
00:29:52,595 --> 00:29:53,687
It's me, Mrinalini.

456
00:29:54,463 --> 00:29:55,657
I was shooting on the next floor.

457
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:57,629
Heard you were here... and so...

458
00:29:58,334 --> 00:29:59,699
I thought I'd come
and congratulate you...

459
00:30:00,469 --> 00:30:01,629
...for your Padmashree AvWard.

460
00:30:02,438 --> 00:30:03,632
We're so proud of you!

461
00:30:05,341 --> 00:30:06,467
Have vWe met?

462
00:30:06,642 --> 00:30:08,439
Don't tell me
you don't know her, Ranu!

463
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:09,700
Mrinalini Mitra!

464
00:30:10,613 --> 00:30:12,376
She's a terrific actress!

465
00:30:12,648 --> 00:30:15,708
That new girl who got
the Urvashi Award...

466
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:18,412
...for Siddhartha's last picture.
Rajani!

467
00:30:18,454 --> 00:30:19,648
Oh yes.

468
00:30:20,323 --> 00:30:21,654
I've heard the name. So...

469
00:30:22,425 --> 00:30:23,289
Keshto!

470
00:30:23,492 --> 00:30:24,459
Keshto!

471
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,288
Get me my paan box!

472
00:30:28,464 --> 00:30:29,488
Oh my!

473
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,630
A national award
for your very first picture!

474
00:30:34,437 --> 00:30:36,462
And so young too!

475
00:30:36,605 --> 00:30:38,470
Talented. Aren't vWe?

476
00:30:38,574 --> 00:30:40,269
Give me your blessings...

477
00:30:40,376 --> 00:30:41,638
No, no! None of that!

478
00:30:44,413 --> 00:30:46,540
We are a sinning lot!

479
00:30:47,683 --> 00:30:49,446
Our blessings...

480
00:30:49,618 --> 00:30:51,449
...will hardly vWork, my dear!

481
00:30:54,357 --> 00:30:56,450
But I'll bless you anyway!

482
00:30:56,692 --> 00:31:00,685
May you attain
worldwide fame!

483
00:31:01,497 --> 00:31:02,725
May the audience adore you!

484
00:31:03,332 --> 00:31:05,391
For us artistes...

485
00:31:05,568 --> 00:31:07,695
...the audience is the only God!

486
00:31:08,337 --> 00:31:09,429
Right. Prasad-da?

487
00:31:09,505 --> 00:31:10,301
Of course!

488
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:11,371
Hey PavWcha!

489
00:31:11,474 --> 00:31:12,498
PavWcha!

490
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:14,632
Come and take a photograph
for your magazine!

491
00:31:14,744 --> 00:31:20,705
Padmashree Sumitra Devi vWith National
Award-winner Mrinalini Mitra!

492
00:31:21,484 --> 00:31:23,611
Caption: Yesterday meets Today!

493
00:31:23,753 --> 00:31:27,348
And tell them to send me a
commission for the idea!

494
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:28,445
Hey, Ranu!

495
00:31:28,591 --> 00:31:31,389
Ranu! Just got another idea!

496
00:31:31,694 --> 00:31:37,326
How about you as Ayesha and Meenu
as Tilottama in Durgeshnandini?

497
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,589
What do you think?

498
00:31:38,734 --> 00:31:41,396
We were looking for a new face.

499
00:31:42,405 --> 00:31:43,394
Weren't we?

500
00:31:44,473 --> 00:31:46,373
Splendid idea!

501
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:48,635
You sure have an eye for casting!

502
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:50,677
Here, have a paan.

503
00:31:51,414 --> 00:31:52,472
Don't say later...

504
00:31:52,515 --> 00:31:54,574
...that Ranu's miserly
vWith her favours!

505
00:31:58,721 --> 00:31:59,653
Well, my girl...

506
00:32:01,457 --> 00:32:02,583
...think you'll manage?

507
00:32:05,394 --> 00:32:09,353
Won't be nervous acting
with Ranu-di, will you now?

508
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:13,293
Of course. I'd be a little nervous...

509
00:32:13,436 --> 00:32:17,270
...but acting vWith you
would be a dream come true!

510
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:20,638
Nervous! A likely candidate!

511
00:32:22,378 --> 00:32:25,313
It'll be a match between equals!

512
00:32:25,614 --> 00:32:26,638
Mark my words!

513
00:32:27,483 --> 00:32:30,475
A tooth and nail fight!

514
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:31,651
Come on, Pawcha!

515
00:32:32,488 --> 00:32:34,353
Hurry up!

516
00:32:35,324 --> 00:32:39,454
Of course I was thrilled!
Who wouldn't be after an Urvashi?

517
00:32:39,628 --> 00:32:41,755
That too in your very first picture.
No kidding!

518
00:32:42,531 --> 00:32:43,623
Can I make a request Barun-da?

519
00:32:43,732 --> 00:32:45,359
Sure! Go ahead.

520
00:32:45,468 --> 00:32:46,594
Don't say 'picture'. Please!

521
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:50,499
Not call a picture a 'picture'?
What do I call it then?

522
00:32:51,373 --> 00:32:55,332
Call it a film... or a movie?
It is moving images after all...

523
00:32:56,745 --> 00:33:00,340
Quite a snob. Aren't you Meenu?

524
00:33:00,483 --> 00:33:04,317
Okay, okay. Film!

525
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:06,421
So tell me, which pic -

526
00:33:07,523 --> 00:33:10,356
Film! Which films
are you vWorking in novW?

527
00:33:10,593 --> 00:33:12,652
Which is the most exciting?

528
00:33:13,729 --> 00:33:15,458
Durgeshnandini!

529
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:17,328
Sumitra Devi as Ayesha
and me as Tilottama!

530
00:33:19,335 --> 00:33:19,733
Didi...

531
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,735
Yes, Kamala-di?
Are the lights ready?

532
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:26,340
No... which sari should I press?

533
00:33:26,442 --> 00:33:28,342
The stripes or the checks?

534
00:33:28,511 --> 00:33:30,411
Why me, Kamala-di?

535
00:33:30,513 --> 00:33:32,640
Ask one of the assistants!

536
00:33:33,415 --> 00:33:34,677
You're the limit, Kamala-di!

537
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,750
Don't pretend Barun-da!
As if you hadn't heard the news!

538
00:33:41,657 --> 00:33:42,646
Are you sure, Meenu?

539
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:43,723
What d'you mean?

540
00:33:44,393 --> 00:33:46,293
Prasad Sen offered me
the role himself!

541
00:33:46,462 --> 00:33:47,588
In front of Ranu-di!

542
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,595
It vWas in the papers too.
Didn't you see it?

543
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:51,732
Wait, I had cut it out...

544
00:33:52,568 --> 00:33:53,500
Kamala-di?

545
00:33:53,536 --> 00:33:54,662
Where did I keep that cutting?

546
00:33:55,304 --> 00:33:56,601
It seems you haven't seen
today's paper then...

547
00:33:57,706 --> 00:33:59,333
Here...

548
00:34:03,412 --> 00:34:04,674
MRINALINI THROWN OUT OF DURGESHNANDINI

549
00:34:04,713 --> 00:34:07,409
They say Sumitra Devi was behind it all.

550
00:34:08,317 --> 00:34:11,514
Our editor wants a reaction from you...

551
00:34:21,297 --> 00:34:21,763
Post script:

552
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:28,303
After my death,
no memorial services should be held...

553
00:34:28,504 --> 00:34:33,407
...nor any obituaries about me
published anywhere.

554
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,575
I have been a victim
of media attention all my life.

555
00:34:37,746 --> 00:34:41,409
I vWould like to be
spared that in death.

556
00:34:41,717 --> 00:34:44,447
If this last wish is respected...

557
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,621
...it would be the most
fitting tribute to me.

558
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:49,650
Mrinalini Mitra.

559
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:28,528
For Meenu the Madcap.
Your brother

560
00:36:03,732 --> 00:36:06,462
This too, was a commercial success!
Abhi

561
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:35,619
SOHINl: MRINALINI & SIDDHARTHA'S LOVE
CHILD?

562
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:39,501
Our first child Siddhartha!

563
00:36:39,735 --> 00:36:41,703
Born of our love...

564
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:45,669
Could you have said this
if I'd been your vWife?

565
00:36:50,312 --> 00:36:51,643
Look at me, Meenu!

566
00:37:00,656 --> 00:37:01,748
But not right now.

567
00:37:08,564 --> 00:37:10,293
The first lesson in acting!

568
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:10,728
Understand?

569
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,692
Now a blind girl's timing...

570
00:37:13,335 --> 00:37:15,394
...and Mrinalini Mitra's timing
can't be the same!

571
00:37:15,537 --> 00:37:16,265
Can it?

572
00:37:16,472 --> 00:37:16,699
No...

573
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:18,363
Much more uncertainty...

574
00:37:18,607 --> 00:37:19,471
hesitation...

575
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:20,570
...all that has to come in!

576
00:37:23,312 --> 00:37:23,607
Meenu...

577
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,304
You've read it
a number of times now...

578
00:37:26,482 --> 00:37:27,346
...this novel Rajani.

579
00:37:28,317 --> 00:37:30,410
Can you tell me what the author
keeps saying to Rajani?

580
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:33,383
Well?

581
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,558
'SIowly Rajani, slowly'?

582
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:39,690
I'm saying the same to you!

583
00:37:40,462 --> 00:37:42,487
Slowly Mrinalini. Slowly!

584
00:37:42,664 --> 00:37:43,722
Don't rush.

585
00:37:44,433 --> 00:37:46,458
Okay, let's try scene no 5 where...

586
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:47,502
Sachindra, sir...

587
00:37:47,736 --> 00:37:49,431
...where Sachindra says to Rajani -

588
00:37:49,671 --> 00:37:50,501
One minute!

589
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,470
Let him serve the tea first -

590
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:53,640
Put it on the table.

591
00:37:54,476 --> 00:37:56,341
Good God! What's all this now?

592
00:37:57,446 --> 00:37:58,470
Right in the middle of our rehearsal...

593
00:37:59,481 --> 00:38:00,413
Honestly!

594
00:38:00,682 --> 00:38:01,740
All very vWell for you to talk!

595
00:38:02,317 --> 00:38:03,443
Lunch has to be cooked too!

596
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:05,416
That's just when you'll want your tea!

597
00:38:06,522 --> 00:38:07,511
How are you Manas?
- Fine.

598
00:38:08,423 --> 00:38:09,617
Ajanta?
- Very vWell.

599
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:11,420
But what's all this Boudi?

600
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,654
What have you done
- We can't eat so much!

601
00:38:15,297 --> 00:38:15,524
Of course you can.

602
00:38:16,298 --> 00:38:18,391
Eat it vWhile it's hot.

603
00:38:20,402 --> 00:38:22,427
And is this your new heroine?

604
00:38:22,538 --> 00:38:24,403
Yes, that's Meenu.

605
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:27,736
Meenu?

606
00:38:28,544 --> 00:38:29,568
That's my pet name Boudi.

607
00:38:29,745 --> 00:38:31,269
My name is Mrinalini.

608
00:38:31,713 --> 00:38:32,680
Mrinalini Mitra.

609
00:38:33,515 --> 00:38:34,675
What're you doing!

610
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:36,349
What's all this nonsense?

611
00:38:36,518 --> 00:38:37,485
What exactly is going on here?

612
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:38,711
Is this a tea party or a rehearsal?

613
00:38:39,354 --> 00:38:39,615
Come on now!

614
00:38:39,655 --> 00:38:40,519
Let's finish this scene -

615
00:38:40,722 --> 00:38:41,518
Forget the tea!

616
00:38:42,558 --> 00:38:43,547
Whatever you like!

617
00:38:44,593 --> 00:38:45,719
There won't be any later...

618
00:38:47,362 --> 00:38:47,691
...remember that!

619
00:38:49,364 --> 00:38:49,591
Ready Meenu?

620
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:53,433
Y-es... ready...

621
00:38:54,336 --> 00:38:55,303
I'll give your cue.

622
00:38:55,537 --> 00:38:56,435
When you hear that...

623
00:38:56,672 --> 00:38:57,570
...Iook at me.

624
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,467
But with unseeing eyes!
Ready?

625
00:39:03,478 --> 00:39:04,274
Rajani!

626
00:39:06,481 --> 00:39:07,277
Wrong!

627
00:39:07,516 --> 00:39:10,644
But you just asked me
to look at you!

628
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:13,279
Not at me! In my general direction!

629
00:39:13,488 --> 00:39:15,581
How can a blind girl look
exactly 'at' someone?

630
00:39:16,391 --> 00:39:18,291
Come on! We must get this right!

631
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,392
This is very important!

632
00:39:20,362 --> 00:39:21,590
Okay Manas.
Now you give her the full cue.

633
00:39:22,364 --> 00:39:23,388
I'm going to watch
from the camera angle.

634
00:39:25,734 --> 00:39:26,598
Listen my girl...

635
00:39:27,736 --> 00:39:29,431
...Iook at me -

636
00:40:38,373 --> 00:40:42,469
(Invitation to a party
for the film Beesh Kanya)

637
00:43:04,419 --> 00:43:05,386
You won't get anywhere
as an actress!

638
00:43:07,622 --> 00:43:10,386
Not if you are
as indisciplined as this!

639
00:43:11,326 --> 00:43:12,554
Just because you've got
an Urvashi Award...

640
00:43:12,694 --> 00:43:14,662
...you think you're
the cat's whiskers!

641
00:43:15,697 --> 00:43:17,324
Don't think I haven't heard!

642
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,591
Late nights and
wild parties every day!

643
00:43:21,403 --> 00:43:22,495
Returning home in the wee hours!

644
00:43:23,305 --> 00:43:24,670
Dark circles under your eyes
the next day!

645
00:43:24,706 --> 00:43:25,695
What do you think you're up to?

646
00:43:27,676 --> 00:43:28,404
Listen!

647
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,375
Just talent is not enough.
Understand?

648
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:32,308
You need dedication
along with that!

649
00:43:33,315 --> 00:43:35,647
If you haven't understood
this elementary principle...

650
00:43:36,418 --> 00:43:38,318
...then go! Don't waste
your time and ours!!

651
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,290
Is that clear?

652
00:43:51,533 --> 00:43:53,364
Or are you rearranging
your room! What're you doing?

653
00:44:01,443 --> 00:44:03,377
Why did you scold me
in front of everyone!

654
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,450
Okay, come on!

655
00:45:19,554 --> 00:45:20,521
One rehearsal and take...

656
00:45:20,722 --> 00:45:21,518
Ready Meenu?

657
00:45:21,723 --> 00:45:24,453
Yes, long ago.
But the continuity sari...

658
00:45:26,361 --> 00:45:27,589
Haven't given her the sari yet!

659
00:45:27,662 --> 00:45:29,289
We have to take the shot
in exactly 15 minutes!

660
00:45:29,397 --> 00:45:29,692
Right?

661
00:45:30,298 --> 00:45:32,289
12 minutes! Sunrise at
exactly 05.12 today!

662
00:45:32,601 --> 00:45:33,625
The dresser isn't here yet, sir.

663
00:45:33,735 --> 00:45:36,295
Hey! Check if the sari's come!

664
00:45:36,438 --> 00:45:38,497
Told you, not yet!

665
00:45:38,673 --> 00:45:41,437
A spot boy is waiting at the gate.
He'll bring it as soon as it comes.

666
00:45:43,545 --> 00:45:45,410
Get the sari out of the
trunk and give it to her!

667
00:45:46,681 --> 00:45:48,649
Kamala-di had taken the
sari home last night...

668
00:45:49,384 --> 00:45:51,443
...said she'd bring it vWashed
and pressed before the shot.

669
00:45:54,756 --> 00:45:56,485
Meenu-di's dresser, sir.

670
00:45:59,594 --> 00:46:01,459
So we'll miss the shot now!

671
00:46:02,297 --> 00:46:03,389
Because of a damn sari!

672
00:46:03,632 --> 00:46:04,724
Who the hell gave her permission...

673
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,494
...to take the sari home?

674
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:09,602
Not a single continuity article
must leave the studio premises!

675
00:46:13,675 --> 00:46:14,471
AnsvWer me!

676
00:46:17,445 --> 00:46:19,413
Kamala-di! I asked you a question!

677
00:46:19,681 --> 00:46:21,342
Do you know that vWe missed
the shot because of you?

678
00:46:22,284 --> 00:46:23,410
That I let you take the sari home...

679
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:26,577
...against the director's express
orders just because I trusted you?

680
00:46:26,721 --> 00:46:28,712
Have you any idea of the
loss incurred because of you?

681
00:46:31,426 --> 00:46:32,358
Sorry didi...

682
00:46:32,427 --> 00:46:33,724
No, simply saying
sorry is not good enough!

683
00:46:34,729 --> 00:46:36,697
Answer my question!

684
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:39,357
You fell asleep, right?

685
00:46:40,335 --> 00:46:40,733
What time did you wake up?

686
00:46:44,673 --> 00:46:47,403
Kamala-di, speak clearly!

687
00:46:47,575 --> 00:46:48,564
I got up at 3.

688
00:46:49,577 --> 00:46:50,339
What!

689
00:46:50,712 --> 00:46:51,610
3AM!

690
00:46:54,316 --> 00:46:55,476
What were you doing up at that hour?

691
00:46:56,618 --> 00:46:57,642
Making lentil paste...

692
00:46:59,321 --> 00:47:00,754
...gets up at 3 every
morning and makes lentil paste...

693
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,453
...for the local confectioner.

694
00:47:03,692 --> 00:47:05,421
Needs the money to
supplement her income.

695
00:47:07,295 --> 00:47:09,695
A dresser's wages are
hardly enough for her needs!

696
00:47:11,566 --> 00:47:13,557
How much I screamed at her today!

697
00:47:15,303 --> 00:47:16,531
And it wasn't even her fault!

698
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:20,599
There was a strike in her
area this morning! - Why?

699
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:22,576
Don't know... something political...

700
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,407
Oh yes! Some CPM leader
was killed, right?

701
00:47:24,512 --> 00:47:28,744
Probably. - God! Party
politics will ruin this state!

702
00:47:29,684 --> 00:47:32,346
Do you how young Kamala-di
was when she became a widovW?

703
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:34,385
How young?

704
00:47:34,456 --> 00:47:35,616
She was only twenty-five!

705
00:47:36,725 --> 00:47:37,692
She should've married again!

706
00:47:38,693 --> 00:47:40,490
Found a nice,
loaded party for herself!

707
00:47:40,595 --> 00:47:42,290
Rubbish!
- Why're you moving away?

708
00:47:42,364 --> 00:47:43,353
What a vWay to talk!

709
00:47:44,332 --> 00:47:46,391
It vWasn't that easy to remarry then!

710
00:47:47,335 --> 00:47:48,324
That too in Bangladesh!

711
00:47:49,304 --> 00:47:50,498
Are you listening?

712
00:47:51,306 --> 00:47:51,533
I am!

713
00:47:52,307 --> 00:47:53,501
Listening vWhile kissing...

714
00:47:54,409 --> 00:47:58,311
She came here as a refugee...
Brought up her daughters all by herself!

715
00:47:59,347 --> 00:48:00,609
She married her elder
daughter off last year.

716
00:48:01,716 --> 00:48:03,650
Next year it'll be the younger one.

717
00:48:04,552 --> 00:48:05,610
And then she'll be free...

718
00:48:07,455 --> 00:48:09,514
There you are! A happy ending!

719
00:48:10,392 --> 00:48:11,359
Don't joke about it!

720
00:48:11,526 --> 00:48:12,550
You know what I've decided?

721
00:48:13,294 --> 00:48:15,694
What? - I'll ask her to come
& live with me after that.

722
00:48:16,564 --> 00:48:17,656
I live here all by myself.

723
00:48:18,466 --> 00:48:19,694
That vWay she'd be able
to save on house rent too!

724
00:48:20,568 --> 00:48:21,432
What d'you think?

725
00:48:21,703 --> 00:48:24,297
Know vWhat your problem is Meenu?

726
00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:30,503
Now you've decided to
control poor Kamala-di's life!

727
00:48:31,346 --> 00:48:32,370
Whatever for?

728
00:48:33,481 --> 00:48:34,743
Give her some money instead!

729
00:48:35,517 --> 00:48:36,541
That would come in handy.

730
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:39,612
I could give her some too.
For her daughter's wedding...

731
00:48:39,687 --> 00:48:40,619
She won't take it!

732
00:48:41,456 --> 00:48:42,616
I've offered many times.

733
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:44,680
She may be poor...

734
00:48:45,493 --> 00:48:46,585
...but she's got a lot of self-respect!

735
00:48:47,762 --> 00:48:49,457
That's what I like so much about her!

736
00:48:51,366 --> 00:48:54,733
So it won't hurt her self
respect to live here as a dependant?

737
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:56,559
What kind of talk is that?

738
00:48:57,472 --> 00:48:58,564
Why a dependant?

739
00:49:00,275 --> 00:49:00,707
You should say...

740
00:49:01,476 --> 00:49:02,738
...like a guardian!

741
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:06,579
I've given up asking my mother...

742
00:49:07,582 --> 00:49:09,550
...so I'm asking Kamala-di.

743
00:49:15,356 --> 00:49:16,448
Do as you wish.

744
00:49:18,626 --> 00:49:19,558
I have to go now...

745
00:49:20,495 --> 00:49:21,359
I'm late already...

746
00:49:21,529 --> 00:49:22,393
So soon?

747
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,391
How come?

748
00:49:24,566 --> 00:49:25,396
Not staying for dinner?

749
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,524
Not possible.

750
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:29,661
Have to pick Mithu up.

751
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:31,664
From her parents' place.

752
00:49:32,607 --> 00:49:35,542
Naturally the'll expect me
to join them for dinner.

753
00:49:36,411 --> 00:49:37,708
It'll get late for the
boys if I go any later.

754
00:49:38,713 --> 00:49:40,305
They have school tomorrow...

755
00:49:40,582 --> 00:49:42,709
Oh! An invitation from the in-laws!

756
00:49:46,421 --> 00:49:47,285
You could say that.

757
00:49:50,391 --> 00:49:51,289
I don't understand it!

758
00:49:51,726 --> 00:49:53,751
You say you have no
relationship with your wife...

759
00:49:54,429 --> 00:49:55,521
...neither emotional, nor physical!

760
00:49:56,331 --> 00:49:58,492
Yet you maintain all social niceties!

761
00:49:59,467 --> 00:50:01,367
What kind of hypocrisy is that?

762
00:50:03,471 --> 00:50:04,699
Well, we do have a social relationship!

763
00:50:20,522 --> 00:50:22,387
Stay on a little longer...

764
00:50:22,657 --> 00:50:24,284
...or do you have shooting?

765
00:50:25,393 --> 00:50:26,451
I do.

766
00:50:27,395 --> 00:50:29,386
You see, because of the Emergency...

767
00:50:29,731 --> 00:50:32,325
...they got permission for the
shoot with a lot of trouble!

768
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,740
What happened. Baby?

769
00:50:49,417 --> 00:50:51,317
...we'll be coming to India with her.

770
00:50:51,386 --> 00:50:52,410
You'll see her then.

771
00:50:52,654 --> 00:50:56,420
You can come too. Whenever
there's a gap in your work, right?

772
00:51:47,308 --> 00:51:50,334
So. Baby... you'll be calling me Aunt?

773
00:51:51,512 --> 00:51:52,501
Not Mummy?

774
00:51:54,382 --> 00:51:55,314
Shona?

775
00:51:56,484 --> 00:51:57,542
Sohini!

776
00:52:09,631 --> 00:52:11,496
Siddhartha had called...

777
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:13,291
Which flight is he coming by?

778
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:41,595
Which flight?

779
00:52:43,364 --> 00:52:45,730
Listen, he's run into
a bit of a problem...

780
00:52:46,601 --> 00:52:48,432
So he's not coming after all?

781
00:52:49,504 --> 00:52:51,631
I knevW it!

782
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:53,570
It isn't exactly like that.

783
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:56,468
Maithili's father
- has had a stroke...

784
00:52:56,711 --> 00:52:59,578
...and there's no one in
their family who can take charge.

785
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:26,605
Bye for now. It'll be okay...

786
00:53:34,716 --> 00:53:38,675
You'll be really well looked
after by your brother in Canada.

787
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:43,723
We can't even go to a doctor here...

788
00:53:44,325 --> 00:53:46,350
...for fear of the news leaking out!

789
00:53:47,295 --> 00:53:50,423
I've been worried sick!

790
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:52,658
Worried my foot!

791
00:53:53,334 --> 00:53:55,427
You wanted me to get
an abortion, remember?

792
00:53:56,437 --> 00:53:57,461
Don't bring all that up any more.

793
00:54:01,576 --> 00:54:04,477
She? How can you be so sure?

794
00:54:04,712 --> 00:54:05,474
I do.

795
00:54:11,652 --> 00:54:15,713
Siddhartha and
Mrinalini's daughter: Sohini

796
00:54:22,497 --> 00:54:26,433
This is a real marriage?
Not a film shot?

797
00:54:28,603 --> 00:54:31,367
You too made the same mistake Meenu!

798
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:33,501
I had no choice ma.

799
00:54:34,709 --> 00:54:36,700
I'm four months' pregnant.

800
00:55:06,307 --> 00:55:09,504
Why don't you come and live vWith me?

801
00:55:10,478 --> 00:55:11,410
Will you?

802
00:55:14,282 --> 00:55:15,715
The water's begun to come in.

803
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:19,381
I'll go and put the kettle on.

804
00:55:25,293 --> 00:55:26,590
Have something to eat before you go...

805
00:55:27,295 --> 00:55:29,559
Shouldn't remain on an
empty stomach too long...

806
00:56:34,462 --> 00:56:36,726
Remember how many times
Mom had my head shaved?

807
00:56:37,365 --> 00:56:38,389
Used to say the hair would grow thicker!

808
00:56:38,566 --> 00:56:41,694
True! It will grow long
and thick, wait and see!

809
00:56:42,303 --> 00:56:44,430
I hate Mamoni!
- Shona!

810
00:56:44,572 --> 00:56:46,369
She's a bad monster!

811
00:56:47,441 --> 00:56:48,635
Ugly dragon!

812
00:56:51,379 --> 00:56:53,643
Shona... where is Shona?

813
00:56:56,684 --> 00:56:58,379
Have a seat Dada...

814
00:56:59,353 --> 00:57:01,344
What's the matter?

815
00:57:01,455 --> 00:57:03,548
Meenu's had her head shaved.

816
00:57:03,691 --> 00:57:06,319
Now she refuses to show
her face to the world!

817
00:57:08,362 --> 00:57:09,294
What a mess!

818
00:57:13,501 --> 00:57:15,332
I feel terrible!

819
00:57:15,569 --> 00:57:16,433
Shona!

820
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,435
O Shona! Let me see your face?

821
00:57:18,673 --> 00:57:20,641
You don't look bad at all, mamma...

822
00:57:20,675 --> 00:57:22,734
I do! I look awful!

823
00:57:24,578 --> 00:57:26,273
Like a vWitch!

824
00:57:27,615 --> 00:57:29,583
A witch!

825
00:57:33,621 --> 00:57:34,610
Let's see what you've got?

826
00:57:45,499 --> 00:57:48,332
Come here... come!

827
00:57:48,402 --> 00:57:52,600
Why're you angry baby? I'll
turn you into a fairy, just see!

828
00:57:55,710 --> 00:58:01,706
Indi, Bindi & Sindi
Peeping from behind a tree...

829
00:58:02,383 --> 00:58:06,410
...one Saturday heard a very nasal song!

830
00:58:06,687 --> 00:58:10,418
Frightened,
Indi-Bindi turned into stone!

831
00:58:11,292 --> 00:58:12,554
What a beautiful fairy!

832
00:58:28,609 --> 00:58:30,702
Shona look! Look at yourself!

833
00:58:55,302 --> 00:58:59,466
Kaku! HovW much longer? You
promised we'd go sea-bathing!

834
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:00,729
Of course we will!

835
00:59:01,275 --> 00:59:03,743
As soon as Mamoni does an okay shot.
We'll jump into the sea!

836
00:59:04,512 --> 00:59:06,377
Come on, hurry up everybody!

837
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,313
Mamoni!
- Hi Shona!

838
00:59:09,617 --> 00:59:11,278
Say 'Start playback! '

839
00:59:12,553 --> 00:59:14,418
Louder! Again!

840
00:59:16,724 --> 00:59:18,453
Wait, wait my dear!

841
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:23,358
Let me fix the reflectors! Or
your Mamoni will look ghastly!

842
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:34,630
Fine. That'll do!

843
00:59:40,481 --> 00:59:41,709
Okay... umbrella out!

844
01:00:24,425 --> 01:00:25,323
Say 'Cut it! '

845
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:27,451
Louder!

846
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,575
Maybe this is the closest
we'll ever get to a marriage...

847
01:01:57,418 --> 01:01:59,386
...this time we three have
together during a shoot!

848
01:02:02,556 --> 01:02:06,356
Majhe majhe... vWhat?

849
01:05:01,502 --> 01:05:06,371
For Mrinalini in admiration -
Chintan. 5th June 1984

850
01:05:07,641 --> 01:05:10,474
Your Bengali handwriting
is very impressive!

851
01:05:10,577 --> 01:05:13,307
I studied in Tagore's university
in Shantiniketan. Throughout.

852
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:18,642
Married a Bengali girl too!
Mira. Didn't you know?

853
01:05:19,553 --> 01:05:21,578
That explains it!
- What explains what?

854
01:05:22,356 --> 01:05:24,324
I used to always wonder
how a Nair (South Indian)...

855
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:27,586
managed to write a love story
about a Muslim girl...

856
01:05:28,395 --> 01:05:30,454
...and a Baul singer
of Bengal!

857
01:05:30,564 --> 01:05:32,327
That too in a remote rustic setting!

858
01:05:32,633 --> 01:05:36,330
But your Bengali pronounciation
still has a touch of the South!

859
01:05:36,437 --> 01:05:37,301
Right here -

860
01:05:37,438 --> 01:05:41,374
Naturally! He lives in the South.
Has a lovely home in Pondicheri!

861
01:05:41,642 --> 01:05:43,337
Another one here please...

862
01:05:48,549 --> 01:05:51,541
But Red Earth vWon't do
as a name for a Bengali film!

863
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:53,381
What'll the film be called?

864
01:05:56,423 --> 01:05:57,720
Why don't you suggest one?

865
01:06:01,728 --> 01:06:02,695
How about Radha?

866
01:06:03,464 --> 01:06:06,490
Because Laila is Radha in a sense...

867
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:08,464
I mean...
- Oh hello Meenu!

868
01:06:09,336 --> 01:06:10,735
I was thinking of calling you!

869
01:06:11,538 --> 01:06:14,302
And here you are in person!
What a co-incidence!

870
01:06:15,342 --> 01:06:17,276
Siddhartha! HovW're you?

871
01:06:17,377 --> 01:06:20,312
Getting by...
- Forgotten Prasad-da completely, eh?

872
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:22,478
Famous director now!

873
01:06:22,616 --> 01:06:24,413
What're you saying! Join us...
- No. No!

874
01:06:24,718 --> 01:06:27,346
Not today. Let me introduce...

875
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:29,679
...my new director - Sabyasachi.

876
01:06:30,424 --> 01:06:31,618
He's directing my new picture.

877
01:06:33,293 --> 01:06:34,555
Witten a terrific script!

878
01:06:35,295 --> 01:06:36,592
Totally heroine oriented!

879
01:06:37,331 --> 01:06:39,424
Meenu. You must do the role!

880
01:06:39,633 --> 01:06:42,397
Let Sabyasachi narrate it
to you one of these days...

881
01:06:43,604 --> 01:06:46,334
What's the point Prasad-da?
No free dates at all!

882
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:49,338
See? Just signed a new film!

883
01:06:51,478 --> 01:06:52,467
What're you saying!

884
01:06:52,613 --> 01:06:54,410
Even if you can manage
some dates early next year...

885
01:06:54,481 --> 01:06:55,607
Totally booked!

886
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:59,284
I had a lot of free dates
at one time, remember?

887
01:06:59,453 --> 01:07:00,715
You didn't want any then!

888
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:05,454
Now that you see fit to cast me.
All my dates are taken!

889
01:07:05,592 --> 01:07:06,684
Ironic, isn't it?

890
01:07:07,294 --> 01:07:08,625
Do sit!
Some tea?

891
01:07:09,463 --> 01:07:10,327
I see!

892
01:07:10,764 --> 01:07:11,628
So it's like that, is it?

893
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:13,628
Very well.

894
01:07:15,402 --> 01:07:16,494
I'll remember this!

895
01:07:17,604 --> 01:07:19,731
Life's a long business you know!

896
01:07:20,474 --> 01:07:21,463
Let's go Sabyasachi.

897
01:07:27,581 --> 01:07:29,344
Really gave it to him!

898
01:07:29,483 --> 01:07:30,381
See. Chintan?

899
01:07:30,584 --> 01:07:32,518
This is known as Star Power!

900
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:34,744
Well, I'm not a saint you know!

901
01:07:36,356 --> 01:07:38,381
Sorry to put you through this!

902
01:07:38,525 --> 01:07:39,457
That's okay.

903
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:41,554
This is also an experience.

904
01:07:42,563 --> 01:07:44,497
So you've read my novel?

905
01:07:44,631 --> 01:07:48,533
Naturally! It was shortlisted
for the Booker Prize...

906
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:50,726
Meenu's a real bookworm!

907
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,329
Anyway. Listen!

908
01:07:54,474 --> 01:07:57,341
You guys chat about the book.
I've got to go...

909
01:07:58,312 --> 01:08:00,303
I have to take this contract
to the producers.

910
01:08:00,414 --> 01:08:01,711
There's some ritual or other...

911
01:08:03,517 --> 01:08:05,610
Radha is a great name!
We'll keep that.

912
01:08:10,724 --> 01:08:12,419
I'll send the car right back.

913
01:08:39,586 --> 01:08:41,713
Why did you want me for Laila?

914
01:08:55,636 --> 01:08:59,402
Then tell me what it is.
Which part of my face?

915
01:08:59,673 --> 01:09:03,473
Eyes? Nose?
Lips? Eyebrows?

916
01:09:03,677 --> 01:09:06,578
It'll help my performance if I know!

917
01:09:07,514 --> 01:09:09,345
Ummm... wait, let me see...

918
01:09:15,555 --> 01:09:19,286
Never mind. Forget it.

919
01:09:22,396 --> 01:09:25,422
You're not beautiful
in the conventional sense.

920
01:09:26,566 --> 01:09:27,430
Thanks!

921
01:09:28,435 --> 01:09:29,629
But there's something else...

922
01:09:49,456 --> 01:09:52,357
Yeats! My favourite poet!

923
01:09:53,393 --> 01:09:54,360
Mine too!

924
01:10:26,626 --> 01:10:29,493
You and Chintan
seem to have really hit it off!

925
01:10:30,464 --> 01:10:32,694
Been seeing him quite a bit lately!
- Well...

926
01:10:33,667 --> 01:10:36,329
There's a shared interest
in literature...

927
01:10:36,636 --> 01:10:38,627
Yes, we've become good friends...

928
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:42,431
That's become an euphemism
for something else Meenu!

929
01:10:42,542 --> 01:10:44,737
It's what you say to journalists
when asked:

930
01:10:45,445 --> 01:10:49,347
Mrinalini Devi, what exactly is your
relationship with Siddhartha Sarkar?

931
01:10:49,483 --> 01:10:51,576
Why, vWe're just good friends!

932
01:10:53,587 --> 01:10:57,353
What exactly is my relationship
vWith Siddhartha Sarkar, Sid?

933
01:10:59,726 --> 01:11:02,286
Our daughter is eight going on nine.

934
01:11:02,462 --> 01:11:04,362
You've still not managed
to become free...

935
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:08,631
There! You've started
your nagging again!

936
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:15,440
Babul is about to sit for
his school leaving exam...

937
01:11:15,542 --> 01:11:18,340
Tutul's still recovering from
his appendix operation...

938
01:11:19,312 --> 01:11:20,370
At this stage how can I possibly...

939
01:11:20,514 --> 01:11:21,378
And Shona?

940
01:11:22,516 --> 01:11:23,676
Isn't she your child too?

941
01:11:24,651 --> 01:11:28,417
Apart from taking her out once in
a while or buying her a few gifts...

942
01:11:28,555 --> 01:11:31,456
Mamoni! Kaku!
A baby tiger! Come quick!

943
01:11:32,425 --> 01:11:33,449
Coming Shona...

944
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:37,328
SIDDHARTHA & MRINALINI'S
LOVE CHILD: SOHINI?

945
01:11:59,553 --> 01:12:01,544
Did anyone else from
the media ask for me?

946
01:12:02,389 --> 01:12:04,653
Ajournalist from 'Silver Screen'
wanted an intervievW.

947
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:07,551
I told him that you weren't vWell.

948
01:12:07,694 --> 01:12:11,460
Then he wanted to know
where Shona was!

949
01:12:11,698 --> 01:12:12,562
What!

950
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,432
Damn!

951
01:12:14,601 --> 01:12:16,501
We shouldn't have brought
her to the studio today!

952
01:12:17,504 --> 01:12:20,337
Should have sent her to
Darjeeling with Dada and Julia!

953
01:12:21,408 --> 01:12:24,502
Ever since those pictures at the zoo
there's been no end to all this!

954
01:12:25,378 --> 01:12:26,367
Where's Shona?

955
01:12:26,513 --> 01:12:28,413
Never let her out of sight!

956
01:12:28,548 --> 01:12:29,572
No, no... Shona...

957
01:12:29,616 --> 01:12:31,311
Thank God today's
the last day of the shoot!

958
01:12:31,551 --> 01:12:33,280
Shona's fine.

959
01:12:33,453 --> 01:12:37,321
I've left her with Chintan Dada...
there they are!

960
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:40,687
Where?

961
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:53,563
Umm?
- May I...

962
01:12:57,344 --> 01:12:58,641
May I say something Didi?

963
01:12:59,479 --> 01:13:01,504
The pendant is not centred!

964
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:02,705
Fix it!

965
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:04,675
Yes... vWhat were you saying?

966
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:10,647
I overheard the dressmen talking...

967
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:12,447
...and I...

968
01:13:13,426 --> 01:13:16,623
Why do you always take forever
to say anything Kamala-Di!

969
01:13:17,497 --> 01:13:18,691
What were they saying?

970
01:13:19,366 --> 01:13:21,334
Come on, give me the bunch of keys -

971
01:13:24,738 --> 01:13:26,672
They were saying...

972
01:13:28,408 --> 01:13:29,636
Boudi's going to...

973
01:13:30,343 --> 01:13:31,537
...have a child again.

974
01:13:31,678 --> 01:13:33,305
What d'you mean Boudi?

975
01:13:33,647 --> 01:13:36,673
Which Boudi?
Say it properly!

976
01:13:37,517 --> 01:13:40,611
Maithili Boudi. Siddhartha-da's wife...

977
01:13:42,489 --> 01:13:43,353
What?

978
01:13:43,623 --> 01:13:45,648
I don't know...

979
01:13:46,293 --> 01:13:47,555
...I'm just telling you what I heard.

980
01:13:50,397 --> 01:13:52,331
Honestly! These people
do nothing but gossip!

981
01:13:52,666 --> 01:13:54,395
A pack of lies!

982
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:57,630
Siddhartha and his wife live
in the same house... that's all!

983
01:13:57,737 --> 01:14:00,729
They've nothing betvWeen them.
I've told you already!

984
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:04,370
Hurry up now.
Where's the nose-ring?

985
01:14:04,477 --> 01:14:07,310
What about the ears?
Earrings or tops? Did you check?

986
01:14:07,614 --> 01:14:08,581
Earrings...

987
01:14:10,317 --> 01:14:13,514
Er... can I say something Didi?

988
01:14:13,653 --> 01:14:15,416
You won't get angry?

989
01:14:15,522 --> 01:14:18,389
Again? Hurry up then!

990
01:14:19,559 --> 01:14:24,428
Why don't you break it off with Dada?

991
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:28,424
I mean... it's been a long time.
Hasn't it?

992
01:14:28,635 --> 01:14:32,332
Dada will never be able
to leave his family...

993
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:35,369
Besides. All that nasty stuff
about you in the papers...

994
01:14:36,476 --> 01:14:38,341
What I say is...

995
01:14:39,446 --> 01:14:42,711
...why break up someone's home?

996
01:14:49,589 --> 01:14:51,352
Yes. Coming!

997
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:53,689
Hurry up.

998
01:14:57,664 --> 01:14:58,688
Hey Bishtu!

999
01:14:59,299 --> 01:15:01,631
Another net on the face light!

1000
01:15:02,535 --> 01:15:03,729
Mahinder, can we
go for a take please?

1001
01:15:04,404 --> 01:15:05,666
Meenu...
Need another rehearsal?

1002
01:15:06,306 --> 01:15:06,567
Manas?

1003
01:15:07,374 --> 01:15:07,669
Rehearsal?

1004
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:09,342
I'm ready. Take! Take!

1005
01:15:13,313 --> 01:15:14,644
Meenu... Oh God!
Why more make-up now?

1006
01:15:16,449 --> 01:15:18,610
Mess up her hair
a bit. That's all!

1007
01:15:22,655 --> 01:15:24,452
Didi glycerin?

1008
01:15:24,591 --> 01:15:25,683
No... ask them to take the shot.

1009
01:15:27,293 --> 01:15:27,588
Ready sir...

1010
01:15:27,694 --> 01:15:31,528
Bishtu!
Didn't I tell you to put on another net?

1011
01:15:34,634 --> 01:15:36,329
Yes... order.

1012
01:15:46,312 --> 01:15:46,641
Lailee...

1013
01:15:48,615 --> 01:15:49,513
O Lailee!

1014
01:15:50,383 --> 01:15:52,647
What's the matter vWith you?
Won't you get up today?

1015
01:15:53,586 --> 01:15:57,647
The whole day went by... you didn't bathe.
Didn't cook. Didn't eat...

1016
01:15:59,559 --> 01:16:01,550
...the neighbours are all gossiping!

1017
01:16:03,596 --> 01:16:05,393
Some down and out
Baul singer...

1018
01:16:06,332 --> 01:16:07,697
...used to be high on hash all day...

1019
01:16:08,435 --> 01:16:11,336
...you're going to mourn
his death like this?

1020
01:16:11,738 --> 01:16:13,296
Who was he to you?

1021
01:16:15,642 --> 01:16:17,371
Who was he?

1022
01:16:18,511 --> 01:16:21,503
Do I myself know who he was?

1023
01:16:22,682 --> 01:16:24,445
Sometimes it vWould seem...

1024
01:16:24,717 --> 01:16:27,652
...he'd alvWays lived within me...

1025
01:16:29,656 --> 01:16:31,453
...and yet sometimes he'd seem...

1026
01:16:32,292 --> 01:16:34,658
...countless leagues away!

1027
01:16:35,662 --> 01:16:37,562
Impossible to reach out to!

1028
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:39,595
Don't talk in riddles Laila!

1029
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,528
I can't make any sense
of your words!

1030
01:16:42,335 --> 01:16:43,427
You're my wife!

1031
01:16:43,603 --> 01:16:47,471
Yet you pine for that vagabond!

1032
01:16:48,575 --> 01:16:51,476
What did you see in him
that you didn't find in me?

1033
01:16:53,513 --> 01:16:54,480
Tell me Laila...

1034
01:16:55,515 --> 01:16:57,483
...how have I wronged you?

1035
01:16:59,352 --> 01:17:03,288
Don't say that! Why should
you have wronged me?

1036
01:17:05,692 --> 01:17:10,459
Besides, who are we
to tell right from wrong?

1037
01:17:13,366 --> 01:17:16,301
Maybe that's the vWay
Allah has ordained it...

1038
01:17:18,505 --> 01:17:21,269
...some are born as
'Ayan Ghosh' in this world...

1039
01:17:21,641 --> 01:17:22,608
...some as 'Krishna'...

1040
01:17:25,345 --> 01:17:26,539
...and some, like me, as 'Radha'...

1041
01:17:31,384 --> 01:17:33,352
Let me check the last frame...
- Come.

1042
01:17:40,326 --> 01:17:41,384
Okay for you?
- All good.

1043
01:17:42,662 --> 01:17:45,597
Okay. Print that!
- Another one for safety sir?

1044
01:17:45,732 --> 01:17:47,427
No need. It'll just get stale!

1045
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,468
Okay... wind up everyone.
Location pack-up!

1046
01:17:51,371 --> 01:17:53,703
Didi?
- Later... let her be...

1047
01:18:02,315 --> 01:18:04,340
It's Boudi! HovW are you?

1048
01:18:04,484 --> 01:18:06,452
I'm fine. How are you all?

1049
01:18:06,553 --> 01:18:07,679
First class! Please come...

1050
01:18:11,558 --> 01:18:12,650
Well, have you packed up?

1051
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:19,430
Let's see...

1052
01:18:23,536 --> 01:18:25,470
Had to come on the last day?

1053
01:18:25,572 --> 01:18:27,540
Well, someone has to
look after the home!

1054
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:45,421
Didi come, let's go to your room...

1055
01:19:05,411 --> 01:19:07,379
I'll explain later...

1056
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:12,350
I have to go with them today!

1057
01:19:13,353 --> 01:19:13,751
You see how it is!

1058
01:19:14,587 --> 01:19:15,451
Dad!

1059
01:19:16,723 --> 01:19:18,281
Coming son...

1060
01:19:20,426 --> 01:19:22,553
Please don't create a scene baby!

1061
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,392
Coming, Babul!

1062
01:19:31,704 --> 01:19:32,568
See you...

1063
01:19:55,461 --> 01:19:55,756
Good?

1064
01:19:58,665 --> 01:19:59,632
Not so good?

1065
01:20:03,736 --> 01:20:09,299
So uh-huh means good,
and unh-hunh means bad, right?

1066
01:20:13,379 --> 01:20:16,314
Mamoni! Uncle Chintan!
What a huge ship!

1067
01:20:23,356 --> 01:20:25,381
Your ice-cream.
- Thanks!

1068
01:20:25,558 --> 01:20:28,288
One huge ship and
many tiny little boats!

1069
01:20:28,728 --> 01:20:32,323
Hm... there are tiny little boats.
But that one is a launch...

1070
01:21:35,661 --> 01:21:36,559
Moti!

1071
01:21:39,532 --> 01:21:40,362
Didi...

1072
01:21:41,701 --> 01:21:45,296
Didi, should I ask Moti
to warm up your dinner?

1073
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:48,272
Didi...

1074
01:22:11,697 --> 01:22:13,688
Didi. It's late...

1075
01:22:35,688 --> 01:22:36,620
I...

1076
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:40,286
...I don't know how to
explain this Meenu...

1077
01:22:41,461 --> 01:22:41,722
It vWas...

1078
01:22:43,529 --> 01:22:45,360
...just an accident!

1079
01:22:46,599 --> 01:22:49,625
Mithu and I don't even share
a bedroom any more...

1080
01:22:52,371 --> 01:22:52,735
Suddenly...

1081
01:22:53,539 --> 01:22:55,370
...late that night...

1082
01:22:57,677 --> 01:22:58,644
...she came into my room.

1083
01:23:00,546 --> 01:23:01,604
She was very upset...

1084
01:23:02,515 --> 01:23:04,483
...about our son Tutul's
post-operative complications.

1085
01:23:07,453 --> 01:23:08,545
And then...

1086
01:23:16,696 --> 01:23:17,560
But trust me...

1087
01:23:17,697 --> 01:23:20,666
My trust or lack of it
is immaterial Siddhartha.

1088
01:23:23,436 --> 01:23:25,666
You're telling me this
five months later.

1089
01:23:27,373 --> 01:23:28,431
You didn't tell me then!

1090
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:31,702
Maybe you would never have...

1091
01:23:32,712 --> 01:23:35,579
...if your wife hadn't become
accidentally pregnant!

1092
01:23:37,416 --> 01:23:38,314
Anyway...

1093
01:23:39,318 --> 01:23:40,717
...these discussions are
meaningless novW.

1094
01:23:46,392 --> 01:23:48,519
Your stuff is in this bag...

1095
01:23:53,566 --> 01:23:54,658
Please take it with you.

1096
01:23:58,437 --> 01:24:00,302
If you want to meet Shona.
Let me know.

1097
01:24:01,574 --> 01:24:02,370
I'll send her across.

1098
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:08,538
But please don't try to meet me...

1099
01:24:11,584 --> 01:24:12,551
Meenu, you really want to...

1100
01:24:13,419 --> 01:24:14,681
...end a relationship
of so many years...

1101
01:24:15,555 --> 01:24:16,351
...like this!

1102
01:24:16,489 --> 01:24:19,356
That relationship has no value
for me any more.

1103
01:24:20,593 --> 01:24:25,690
I've been through a lot of
humiliation and indignity...

1104
01:24:29,535 --> 01:24:30,524
...but not any more!

1105
01:24:42,648 --> 01:24:43,580
But of course!

1106
01:24:46,485 --> 01:24:47,315
Naturally!

1107
01:24:50,756 --> 01:24:52,519
Chintan is there novW! Right?

1108
01:25:01,567 --> 01:25:09,474
My freedom lies in waves of light...

1109
01:25:10,343 --> 01:25:12,470
...in these open skies

1110
01:25:24,357 --> 01:25:34,733
My freedom lies in the dust of
this earth and blades of grass

1111
01:26:00,393 --> 01:26:01,690
Very good!

1112
01:26:14,473 --> 01:26:16,668
You know you were adopted.
Don't you?

1113
01:26:17,276 --> 01:26:20,473
Yes. Mom and Dad told me
when I was six years old.

1114
01:26:30,523 --> 01:26:31,717
But haven't you ever wondered...

1115
01:26:32,525 --> 01:26:35,392
...who your real parents are?

1116
01:26:36,362 --> 01:26:37,294
But I do know!

1117
01:26:37,496 --> 01:26:38,360
You do?

1118
01:26:42,735 --> 01:26:46,637
...I know you're supposed to
be my aunt and Kaaku's your friend.

1119
01:26:52,278 --> 01:26:54,473
And we spent all
our holidays with you...

1120
01:26:57,583 --> 01:26:58,709
And then one night...

1121
01:26:59,385 --> 01:27:03,617
I heard Mom and Dad talking
in our Toronto home...

1122
01:27:07,326 --> 01:27:11,387
They vWere saying. "If Shona wants
to know who her real parents are...

1123
01:27:11,464 --> 01:27:13,364
...should we tell her
about Meenu and Sid?"

1124
01:27:17,737 --> 01:27:18,704
When did this happen?

1125
01:27:19,472 --> 01:27:21,337
Just before this trip.

1126
01:27:28,414 --> 01:27:29,381
Of course...

1127
01:27:30,382 --> 01:27:32,350
Why didn't you and
Kaaku marry?

1128
01:27:32,485 --> 01:27:34,419
Then I could have stayed
with you guys!

1129
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,647
Why did he marry that other Aunty?

1130
01:27:39,391 --> 01:27:41,723
He'd already married
Maithili Aunty Shona.

1131
01:27:42,495 --> 01:27:44,463
Then we met and vWanted
to get married.

1132
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:46,621
But legally you can't marry twice.

1133
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:48,698
So we went to a mandir
and got married.

1134
01:27:52,671 --> 01:27:53,660
A temple.

1135
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:57,569
And that's illegal?

1136
01:27:58,744 --> 01:27:59,676
Sort of...

1137
01:28:02,715 --> 01:28:05,377
Won't Kaaku
see us any more Mamoni?

1138
01:28:13,492 --> 01:28:17,428
Because he'd promised me he'd
take me to see King Kong...

1139
01:28:17,563 --> 01:28:19,497
but when I called him he said...

1140
01:28:19,532 --> 01:28:22,558
'I'm busy Shona. We'll go later.
I'll call you'.

1141
01:28:22,668 --> 01:28:24,499
But... he didn't...

1142
01:28:36,549 --> 01:28:37,675
I don't know Shona!

1143
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:43,611
Supposing Kaaku never comes back?

1144
01:28:45,391 --> 01:28:47,291
Will you feel very bad
mamma?

1145
01:28:49,461 --> 01:28:50,621
I'm here for you Shonai...

1146
01:28:51,564 --> 01:28:52,622
your Mamoni...

1147
01:28:59,738 --> 01:29:02,468
And you'll never leave me?

1148
01:29:04,443 --> 01:29:05,535
No baby!

1149
01:29:09,615 --> 01:29:12,311
Why can't I live with you Mamoni?

1150
01:29:12,518 --> 01:29:14,349
Would you like to?

1151
01:29:15,554 --> 01:29:17,545
Won't miss Mom & Dad?

1152
01:29:17,656 --> 01:29:19,681
A little...
but I'll see them every year!

1153
01:29:20,292 --> 01:29:21,691
And they'll be here
on holidays!

1154
01:29:31,637 --> 01:29:34,663
First let Mom & Dad return from
Darjeeling...

1155
01:29:38,644 --> 01:29:41,408
And you won't be able to
adjust to any school here!

1156
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,607
Let me find out if
the International School has...

1157
01:30:38,337 --> 01:30:39,304
Oh my goodness!

1158
01:30:40,272 --> 01:30:41,466
What d'you think you're doing!

1159
01:30:42,474 --> 01:30:44,465
Just look! Honestly this girl!

1160
01:30:44,576 --> 01:30:46,339
Ruined all my packing!

1161
01:30:47,346 --> 01:30:50,747
As soon as Dada & Julia are back.
We'll have to leave...

1162
01:30:51,383 --> 01:30:52,441
...for the airport!

1163
01:30:52,551 --> 01:30:54,712
Why bother, Mamoni?

1164
01:30:55,521 --> 01:30:56,545
After packing so neatly...

1165
01:31:01,293 --> 01:31:02,419
Uncle Chintan is right!

1166
01:31:05,631 --> 01:31:09,328
So you've started teasing me too!

1167
01:31:09,501 --> 01:31:10,593
Wait, I'll show you!

1168
01:31:18,477 --> 01:31:21,503
We are going to pack it haywire style!

1169
01:31:22,381 --> 01:31:23,643
Just the way it'll get on the flight!

1170
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:24,714
Ready?

1171
01:31:25,551 --> 01:31:26,677
Here goes!

1172
01:31:28,587 --> 01:31:29,485
A pair of jeans!

1173
01:31:31,290 --> 01:31:33,554
And now a... nightie!

1174
01:31:34,727 --> 01:31:36,490
Oh? So novW it's my turn, huh?

1175
01:31:37,296 --> 01:31:38,422
And now a t-shirt!

1176
01:31:38,731 --> 01:31:40,392
Now a skirt!

1177
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:42,424
Another t-shirt!

1178
01:31:43,302 --> 01:31:44,599
There! They're back!

1179
01:31:44,737 --> 01:31:47,706
The session starts from June, but -
- Good morning ma'am!

1180
01:31:49,742 --> 01:31:51,437
But if it's June...

1181
01:31:51,543 --> 01:31:53,602
But we'll make an exception
for you, don't worry.

1182
01:31:54,747 --> 01:31:58,740
But will she be able to adjust?
I'm a little worried...

1183
01:31:59,351 --> 01:32:01,546
I think it'll be
a smooth transition.

1184
01:32:01,653 --> 01:32:03,644
That's true! There are
many kids like her, right?

1185
01:32:11,697 --> 01:32:13,392
The bill please!

1186
01:32:13,499 --> 01:32:14,625
All these?

1187
01:32:16,602 --> 01:32:17,569
This too? Okay...

1188
01:32:17,669 --> 01:32:20,433
Didi!
Please let me pay for this...

1189
01:32:20,572 --> 01:32:22,699
Why?
- It's my gift for Shona.

1190
01:32:32,718 --> 01:32:34,743
Come Didi,
get some sleep now...

1191
01:32:36,488 --> 01:32:39,548
There's an early flight
to Delhi tomorrow!

1192
01:32:39,625 --> 01:32:42,287
Almost done...

1193
01:33:06,518 --> 01:33:09,316
This picture's only 16 reels long!

1194
01:33:09,688 --> 01:33:11,383
Never mind the 'picture' now!

1195
01:33:11,723 --> 01:33:12,587
Let's have lunch...

1196
01:33:20,532 --> 01:33:22,659
Come, eat it vWhile it's hot!

1197
01:33:57,503 --> 01:33:58,561
Now the phone calls have started!

1198
01:33:59,338 --> 01:34:00,498
You eat. I'll take the call.

1199
01:34:02,341 --> 01:34:03,706
Say I'm having lunch.
Call later.

1200
01:34:04,543 --> 01:34:06,477
And speak in Hindi, not Bengali!

1201
01:34:12,518 --> 01:34:14,509
Oh, just a minute.
I'll hand her the phone.

1202
01:34:15,721 --> 01:34:17,382
Call from Canada.

1203
01:34:17,723 --> 01:34:18,621
Dada.

1204
01:34:20,292 --> 01:34:20,724
Yes, Dada?

1205
01:34:21,326 --> 01:34:23,521
What happened?
Is the flight late?

1206
01:34:24,396 --> 01:34:24,623
Meenu...

1207
01:34:26,365 --> 01:34:27,627
You... you haven't heard?

1208
01:34:28,534 --> 01:34:30,525
Heard vWhat?

1209
01:34:30,736 --> 01:34:33,330
About... A.I. 182?

1210
01:34:34,373 --> 01:34:39,367
A. I. 182?
You mean Shona's flight?

1211
01:34:39,511 --> 01:34:43,607
At 12.44 IST. Air India flight 182
Emperor Kanishka...

1212
01:34:43,749 --> 01:34:47,480
...disintegrated over
the Atlantic Ocean.

1213
01:34:49,688 --> 01:34:52,748
Among the 329 passengers
on board...

1214
01:34:53,392 --> 01:34:55,587
mostly Canadian nationals
of Indian origin...

1215
01:34:55,727 --> 01:34:59,322
...there are 84 children
aged 12 years and under.

1216
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:03,497
Come in Dada...

1217
01:35:52,684 --> 01:35:53,708
Does Sid knovW?

1218
01:35:56,288 --> 01:35:57,516
Has he been informed?

1219
01:35:58,423 --> 01:36:03,326
Yes... I called his house.
He's gone on an outdoor shoot...

1220
01:36:04,329 --> 01:36:07,298
They said they'd let him know.

1221
01:36:13,305 --> 01:36:14,567
How is she novW?

1222
01:36:15,407 --> 01:36:17,466
She was released from the
hospital this morning...

1223
01:36:19,411 --> 01:36:22,380
She couldn't take too many tablets...

1224
01:36:22,614 --> 01:36:23,512
Thank God!

1225
01:36:24,549 --> 01:36:26,483
Police inquiries have been
taken care of.

1226
01:36:27,352 --> 01:36:29,479
Kamala-di was a great help!

1227
01:36:32,557 --> 01:36:33,489
Is she in her bedroom?

1228
01:36:36,361 --> 01:36:37,589
Not opening the door.

1229
01:36:39,298 --> 01:36:40,697
Not even for us.

1230
01:36:43,735 --> 01:36:46,431
Why don't you try...

1231
01:37:27,646 --> 01:37:29,375
Sir, the light is ready -

1232
01:37:30,449 --> 01:37:30,676
Yes...

1233
01:37:31,516 --> 01:37:32,414
Let's go...

1234
01:37:32,617 --> 01:37:33,515
Sir!

1235
01:37:36,655 --> 01:37:39,488
Take your time sir... no hurry!

1236
01:37:40,392 --> 01:37:41,654
The actors aren't here yet.

1237
01:37:50,469 --> 01:37:54,405
She had said... I don't want
to fly alone Mamoni!

1238
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:56,537
You come and fetch me!

1239
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:21,595
Why on earth... didn't I
let her stay vWith Dada & Julia?

1240
01:38:22,434 --> 01:38:27,371
At least... at least I used to
see her once a year...

1241
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:29,464
Now...

1242
01:38:41,553 --> 01:38:44,420
How can I ever face Dada & Julia?

1243
01:38:44,656 --> 01:38:47,648
Because I...
I killed their daughter!

1244
01:38:56,635 --> 01:38:57,602
Chintan...

1245
01:39:00,372 --> 01:39:03,432
They couldn't get Shona
out of the vWater...

1246
01:39:04,476 --> 01:39:08,537
They...
they couldn't even find her!

1247
01:39:11,483 --> 01:39:13,383
She must have felt so cold!

1248
01:39:25,697 --> 01:39:27,597
She didn't know how to
swim you know!

1249
01:39:28,366 --> 01:39:30,425
She must've called out for me!

1250
01:39:31,536 --> 01:39:33,436
How terrified she must've been!

1251
01:39:38,543 --> 01:39:39,669
I wasn't there!

1252
01:39:40,612 --> 01:39:42,512
I couldn't hear...

1253
01:39:43,582 --> 01:39:46,449
...I couldn't hear
her cries for help!

1254
01:39:53,592 --> 01:39:54,581
Mira...

1255
01:40:00,398 --> 01:40:01,422
...this is Mrinalini.

1256
01:40:04,302 --> 01:40:06,532
I've brought her home.

1257
01:40:55,287 --> 01:40:58,518
You left Mira and came to Calcutta?

1258
01:41:01,393 --> 01:41:02,655
Right then you needed me more.

1259
01:41:06,731 --> 01:41:08,631
How many times
I've told you Minnie...

1260
01:41:09,734 --> 01:41:12,328
...you believe in only
one kind of love!

1261
01:41:24,416 --> 01:41:28,648
LABANYA
STARRING: MRINALINI MITRA

1262
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:56,312
Didi...

1263
01:41:56,615 --> 01:41:59,516
One Mr. Imtiaz Chowdhury
is here to see you...

1264
01:41:59,651 --> 01:42:01,551
He's waiting in the study.

1265
01:42:05,557 --> 01:42:08,424
I went through your profile.

1266
01:42:09,561 --> 01:42:14,328
I've seen your first film too... er...
Kaal Madhumaash

1267
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:16,694
Didn't have much
of a run. Did it?

1268
01:42:17,702 --> 01:42:18,634
I'm afraid not!

1269
01:42:19,537 --> 01:42:22,404
Even my closest friends
couldn't say otherwise!

1270
01:42:26,411 --> 01:42:27,378
But...

1271
01:42:27,512 --> 01:42:29,412
...it got a lot of critical acclaim...

1272
01:42:30,682 --> 01:42:32,547
...and some awards too, right?

1273
01:42:32,684 --> 01:42:33,616
Right. Right...

1274
01:42:33,752 --> 01:42:35,686
Best Film at the
Rotterdam Film Festival...

1275
01:42:36,354 --> 01:42:38,322
Best Direction at the
National AvWards...

1276
01:42:38,423 --> 01:42:40,687
And at Karlovy Vary it got...

1277
01:42:41,359 --> 01:42:43,384
What's the use of these awards...

1278
01:42:43,728 --> 01:42:47,289
...if one's own people
don't see the film? Hm?

1279
01:42:47,732 --> 01:42:51,429
For whom do you make your films?
Do you know that?

1280
01:42:53,371 --> 01:42:54,269
For vWhom?

1281
01:42:54,706 --> 01:42:58,267
For film-buffs all over.
They're all my own people!

1282
01:43:01,446 --> 01:43:03,573
Your tea's getting cold...

1283
01:43:04,416 --> 01:43:05,576
I didn't want any...

1284
01:43:07,352 --> 01:43:10,549
Still, since they've brought it...

1285
01:43:11,423 --> 01:43:12,412
...would you prefer coffee instead?

1286
01:43:13,391 --> 01:43:14,585
Yeah, coffee'd be good.
Black please!

1287
01:43:17,362 --> 01:43:19,296
Moti!
- Didi you...

1288
01:43:19,364 --> 01:43:24,392
Oh Kamala-di Please ask Moti to
bring us some black coffee...

1289
01:43:27,405 --> 01:43:30,568
So you had an occidental upbringing!

1290
01:43:32,477 --> 01:43:36,436
No, I mean... you were
brought up in America, right?

1291
01:43:36,715 --> 01:43:38,580
Because I asked for black coffee?

1292
01:43:39,551 --> 01:43:41,451
That too!

1293
01:43:42,353 --> 01:43:44,287
Besides. You still roll your 'r'-s!

1294
01:43:44,355 --> 01:43:47,324
National Awarrrds! Karrrlovy Varrry!

1295
01:43:50,595 --> 01:43:53,428
Graduated from the
NYU Film School.

1296
01:43:54,632 --> 01:43:56,497
You're very observant!

1297
01:44:01,673 --> 01:44:04,471
I went through the treatment.

1298
01:44:05,577 --> 01:44:09,308
Especially the end where there's fire
raging across the screen...

1299
01:44:09,514 --> 01:44:13,507
...and wild animals...
- crying out on the soundtrack!

1300
01:44:23,294 --> 01:44:26,388
...you could say
the end of an epoch...

1301
01:44:30,502 --> 01:44:34,666
But the problem is...
I've quit acting Imtiaz!

1302
01:44:35,273 --> 01:44:36,570
I know ma'am. I'm aware of that.

1303
01:44:37,475 --> 01:44:41,707
I don't know how much you...
Thank you! Put it here.

1304
01:44:44,516 --> 01:44:48,577
I don't know how much
you know exactly. Because...

1305
01:44:48,753 --> 01:44:51,483
...I haven't acted even once
in the last 15 years!

1306
01:44:51,623 --> 01:44:55,457
I've had many good offers...
from many eminent directors...

1307
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:56,727
...but I've said no to them all.

1308
01:44:57,695 --> 01:45:02,598
So I'm really sorry Imtiaz, but
I'm afraid my answer has to be no!

1309
01:45:05,503 --> 01:45:09,337
Ma'am. I knew all this
before I came here.

1310
01:45:11,576 --> 01:45:12,634
But why?

1311
01:45:19,317 --> 01:45:20,648
Your acting ability, for one!

1312
01:45:21,319 --> 01:45:22,718
Your personality! Your...

1313
01:45:25,323 --> 01:45:25,721
You...

1314
01:45:27,425 --> 01:45:30,326
...you don't seem to understand
that I need someone...

1315
01:45:31,563 --> 01:45:35,465
...who can deliver lines in English
plus understand Tagore's spirit!

1316
01:45:35,633 --> 01:45:37,533
Where can I get
such an actor for Kunti?

1317
01:45:41,573 --> 01:45:43,507
If you refuse to play Kunti...

1318
01:45:53,718 --> 01:45:56,312
Is the English dialogue done?

1319
01:45:58,756 --> 01:46:02,658
It vWill be. I'm on the look-out
for someone good to do it.

1320
01:46:03,661 --> 01:46:04,650
Yes, but who?

1321
01:46:07,699 --> 01:46:09,291
It'll be done ma'am!

1322
01:46:09,434 --> 01:46:12,460
You just have to say yes &
everything else will fall into place!

1323
01:46:12,737 --> 01:46:15,365
These are pressure tactics Imtiaz!

1324
01:46:15,707 --> 01:46:17,334
Who's playing Karna?

1325
01:46:17,475 --> 01:46:20,569
Talks are on with a British actor...

1326
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:23,371
...but we're still not sure
of getting him!

1327
01:46:23,514 --> 01:46:24,344
And if you don't?

1328
01:46:24,682 --> 01:46:25,478
Plan B?

1329
01:46:32,457 --> 01:46:34,288
Why not play Karna yourself?

1330
01:46:34,559 --> 01:46:35,389
What?

1331
01:46:35,693 --> 01:46:37,661
Sometimes you don't have a choice!

1332
01:46:39,364 --> 01:46:40,729
What about costumes?

1333
01:46:43,368 --> 01:46:45,359
A designer from Bombay
is doing the costumes...

1334
01:46:49,674 --> 01:46:53,576
I don't vWant the costumes to be
of any particular place or time.

1335
01:46:56,414 --> 01:46:59,679
It could be contemporary...
could be ancient...

1336
01:47:00,551 --> 01:47:02,485
It's the concept of the character
that's important here!

1337
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:12,495
I... I'll be right with you...

1338
01:47:48,299 --> 01:47:49,391
Kunti is a widow...

1339
01:47:51,736 --> 01:47:54,534
Many would suggest white for her.

1340
01:47:55,306 --> 01:47:56,432
But you know...

1341
01:47:56,741 --> 01:47:59,676
...that black is the internationally
accepted colour of mourning.

1342
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,551
Tell your designer...

1343
01:48:11,489 --> 01:48:14,287
...that I suggested this.

1344
01:48:20,565 --> 01:48:24,296
Can I... can I ask you
a question ma'am?

1345
01:48:24,602 --> 01:48:25,432
Yes?

1346
01:48:26,304 --> 01:48:28,602
Why did you suddenly give up acting?

1347
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:31,675
Especially after your
portrayal of Tagore's Labanya!

1348
01:48:34,612 --> 01:48:38,378
Have you any idea of
the loss to Bengali cinema?

1349
01:48:47,658 --> 01:48:49,489
No Ajanta. I can't...

1350
01:48:51,362 --> 01:48:52,556
I won't go...

1351
01:48:52,697 --> 01:48:58,329
Tell Rajat & Manas-da
not to vWait for me.

1352
01:49:00,505 --> 01:49:03,303
I don't want to see
Satyajit Ray like that!

1353
01:49:09,614 --> 01:49:11,582
Know vWhy I gave it up?

1354
01:49:14,519 --> 01:49:17,682
All my life I had waited
for a phone call from him!

1355
01:49:18,356 --> 01:49:21,757
After his death it seemed
meaningless to continue.

1356
01:49:22,593 --> 01:49:24,288
I'd had enough of acting...

1357
01:49:25,396 --> 01:49:30,527
My hopes of doing good work
died vWith him!

1358
01:49:36,674 --> 01:49:37,663
You said yes to me!

1359
01:49:49,387 --> 01:49:54,552
Maybe the hunger for good work
never quite dies in an actor...

1360
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:56,688
...and so I had to agree!

1361
01:50:21,419 --> 01:50:22,545
Mother?
- I knovW! Weird!

1362
01:50:22,753 --> 01:50:25,415
Exactly! I mean...
- Mother sounds funny here!

1363
01:50:25,556 --> 01:50:26,682
I knovW!

1364
01:50:26,724 --> 01:50:31,718
They did a literal translation
from Tagore's poem!

1365
01:50:40,638 --> 01:50:45,598
Um... my lady... no, listen Imtiaz!
How about good woman who are you?

1366
01:50:53,417 --> 01:50:56,750
Did you ever translate
Tagore's poem yourself?

1367
01:50:57,421 --> 01:51:00,356
No... it just struck me!

1368
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:07,420
No, really! As I was...
- Anyway, Meenu listen! Meenu!

1369
01:51:07,565 --> 01:51:11,592
You correct this, okay?
- Correct this!

1370
01:51:14,372 --> 01:51:17,307
Just hear me out...
- Listen to me woman!

1371
01:51:17,675 --> 01:51:21,475
Just complete the basic correction.
Then obviously I'll look into it!

1372
01:51:22,446 --> 01:51:24,676
I have loads of prep for this film!

1373
01:51:25,383 --> 01:51:28,546
And I have to play Karna.
Damn that British actor!

1374
01:51:30,354 --> 01:51:32,413
Besides. This could be a joint work!

1375
01:51:33,357 --> 01:51:34,654
Your name would appear next mine...

1376
01:51:37,662 --> 01:51:40,358
No! No! Not at all!

1377
01:51:40,665 --> 01:51:43,327
Then here's your script!
I'm not touching it!

1378
01:51:44,368 --> 01:51:47,360
You're so reticent!
Why?

1379
01:51:47,505 --> 01:51:50,531
You think seeing my name up there
means anything any more?

1380
01:51:52,476 --> 01:51:53,374
No

1381
01:51:53,511 --> 01:51:54,341
It's not that...

1382
01:51:55,313 --> 01:51:59,545
I thought... it'd be a nice way of
us being... linked together?

1383
01:52:01,285 --> 01:52:03,446
In art... if not in real life!

1384
01:52:03,654 --> 01:52:05,485
And why not in real life?

1385
01:52:05,723 --> 01:52:07,657
Don't have the courage?

1386
01:52:10,728 --> 01:52:11,695
Do you?

1387
01:52:14,398 --> 01:52:23,466
Your social standing... your image...
could you risk all that for me?

1388
01:52:27,478 --> 01:52:28,410
I don't know...

1389
01:52:30,514 --> 01:52:31,606
...perhaps not...

1390
01:52:43,494 --> 01:52:44,324
Meenu...

1391
01:52:45,329 --> 01:52:48,492
Let's run away somewhere
once the film is done...

1392
01:52:54,739 --> 01:52:58,607
You and I will arrive separately!

1393
01:52:59,277 --> 01:53:00,574
Not a soul will know!

1394
01:53:01,412 --> 01:53:02,470
How about it, hm?

1395
01:53:02,647 --> 01:53:03,614
And then?

1396
01:53:04,715 --> 01:53:07,650
Then vWe'll rent an attic...

1397
01:53:08,686 --> 01:53:10,745
...roam the streets of
Paris by day...

1398
01:53:11,489 --> 01:53:14,549
...visit museums...
- sit and chat at roadside cafés...

1399
01:53:14,659 --> 01:53:16,559
Right! And then...

1400
01:53:16,661 --> 01:53:21,291
...at night we'll return to our attic!
With a bottle of red wine...

1401
01:53:21,432 --> 01:53:24,458
some cheeses... breads...
- Foodie!

1402
01:53:25,403 --> 01:53:27,428
And after that...

1403
01:53:27,638 --> 01:53:30,368
No! After that nothing!

1404
01:53:30,474 --> 01:53:32,567
You've given me loads
of stuff to correct!

1405
01:53:32,643 --> 01:53:34,338
When do you suppose I'll do it?

1406
01:53:34,478 --> 01:53:35,536
The shoot's around the corner!

1407
01:54:19,724 --> 01:54:21,316
Well?

1408
01:54:24,562 --> 01:54:28,430
So novW all that's left is the fire.

1409
01:54:28,566 --> 01:54:30,500
When're we filming that?

1410
01:54:32,303 --> 01:54:33,702
Fire! Fire!

1411
01:54:35,573 --> 01:54:37,507
Get more water!
Another bucket!

1412
01:54:38,376 --> 01:54:40,503
Hurry!
Call the fire brigade!

1413
01:54:48,352 --> 01:54:50,582
Get a chair for her. Someone!

1414
01:54:53,357 --> 01:54:54,551
Get a bloody chair here!

1415
01:54:59,563 --> 01:55:03,465
Hurry up with the water!
Blankets! Sand!

1416
01:55:30,361 --> 01:55:36,527
What? What is it?
- Kamala- di!

1417
01:55:36,667 --> 01:55:39,500
Hey... hold her someone!
Stay here with her!

1418
01:56:35,659 --> 01:56:37,684
It's been three months...

1419
01:56:46,504 --> 01:56:50,270
Do you... blame me?

1420
01:56:52,343 --> 01:56:53,708
For Kamala-di's...

1421
01:57:47,498 --> 01:57:49,329
I am coming to you...

1422
01:58:27,538 --> 01:58:29,699
Tell me how many
happy marriages have you seen?

1423
01:58:30,674 --> 01:58:32,437
Take the case of literature...

1424
01:58:32,543 --> 01:58:35,512
...any truly memorable work...

1425
01:58:37,281 --> 01:58:40,580
...how many books have been written
about married couples? Hm?

1426
01:58:45,489 --> 01:58:47,719
You'd wanted to make
a home with Sid...

1427
01:58:54,565 --> 01:58:57,625
Sid couldn't give that to you.
He was vWeak...

1428
01:58:58,736 --> 01:59:02,536
...but it doesn't mean
he never loved you at all!

1429
01:59:04,375 --> 01:59:07,572
Maybe he did. In his own flawed way.

1430
01:59:11,682 --> 01:59:13,582
Life is so random!

1431
01:59:21,392 --> 01:59:23,587
...but nothing is really
vWithin our control.

1432
01:59:26,697 --> 01:59:28,631
Take Mira and me...

1433
01:59:32,469 --> 01:59:35,529
Did vWe knovW vWhen we got married...

1434
01:59:37,541 --> 01:59:38,667
...that she'd become crippled?

1435
01:59:39,309 --> 01:59:40,674
That she'd never be
able to bear a child?

1436
01:59:58,562 --> 02:00:03,522
Sometimes you have to
let go Minnie...

1437
02:00:04,435 --> 02:00:07,529
Just let go
and take life as it comes!

1438
02:00:13,644 --> 02:00:15,612
There's yet another
kind of love Minnie...

1439
02:00:18,582 --> 02:00:20,607
...perhaps you never realised it...

1440
02:00:23,353 --> 02:00:26,379
A love that has
no expectations...

1441
02:00:35,299 --> 02:00:35,594
I know.

1442
02:00:37,634 --> 02:00:39,431
You don't have to say any more...

1443
02:01:58,515 --> 02:01:59,607
What's it Begum?

1444
02:02:00,551 --> 02:02:03,452
Need to go out?
Come!

1445
02:02:05,622 --> 02:02:09,388
Oh dear me!
Wait, wait, wait -

1446
02:02:26,476 --> 02:02:28,376
Just a minute!

1447
02:02:28,512 --> 02:02:30,480
Wait! Wait!

1448
02:02:32,516 --> 02:02:33,312
Come...

1449
02:03:53,664 --> 02:03:53,914
Lanes and by-lanes trip my heels -

1450
02:03:53,914 --> 02:03:57,725
Lanes and by-lanes trip my heels -

1451
02:03:58,568 --> 02:04:02,527
Fragile households! Whose are these?

1452
02:04:03,340 --> 02:04:07,436
In a profound comedy of
birth and death

1453
02:04:07,577 --> 02:04:15,712
Lies the essence of tears and mirth.

1454
02:04:17,454 --> 02:04:21,686
It's the call of night,
a ghostly beckoning

1455
02:04:22,392 --> 02:04:26,385
In it lie seeds of sorcery -

1456
02:04:26,697 --> 02:04:31,634
Such enchantment...
all seems nothing!

1457
02:04:32,302 --> 02:04:36,363
Conjuror's gold in the heart of being!

1458
02:04:36,707 --> 02:04:41,508
Yet I must leave, I must go far

1459
02:04:42,579 --> 02:04:46,481
A ghostly vigil waits for me

1460
02:04:47,417 --> 02:04:52,480
Where yearning rocks
to the rhythm of waves

1461
02:04:52,656 --> 02:04:57,684
Where sounds gather to devour memory...

1462
02:04:58,528 --> 02:05:03,465
At me tugs night's sleepless river

1463
02:05:04,401 --> 02:05:07,734
At me tugs the secret dark

1464
02:05:08,638 --> 02:05:13,541
Breaks my sleep and opens wide

1465
02:05:14,478 --> 02:05:18,380
The bolted doors of sightless night.

1466
02:05:28,425 --> 02:05:31,519
Lanes and by-lanes trip my heels -

1467
02:05:31,661 --> 02:05:34,687
Fragile households! Whose are these?

1468
02:05:35,399 --> 02:05:38,698
In a profound comedy of birth and death

1469
02:05:39,336 --> 02:05:48,301
Lies the essence of tears and mirth.

1470
02:05:51,314 --> 02:05:54,477
It's the call of night,
a ghostly beckoning

1471
02:05:54,618 --> 02:05:57,610
In it lie seeds of sorcery -

1472
02:05:57,721 --> 02:06:01,452
Such enchantment... all seems nothing!

1473
02:06:01,558 --> 02:06:05,494
Conjuror's gold in the heart of being!

1474
02:06:06,696 --> 02:06:09,722
Yet I must leave, I must go far

1475
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:13,597
A ghostly vigil waits for me

1476
02:06:13,670 --> 02:06:17,436
Where yearning rocks
to the rhythm of waves

1477
02:06:17,574 --> 02:06:21,442
Where sounds gather to devour memory...

1478
02:06:24,414 --> 02:06:27,645
At me tugs night's sleepless river

1479
02:06:28,285 --> 02:06:31,413
At me tugs the secret dark

1480
02:06:31,521 --> 02:06:34,752
Breaks my sleep and opens wide

1481
02:06:35,392 --> 02:06:37,690
The bolted doors of sightless night.

1482
02:06:38,395 --> 02:06:41,296
At me tugs...

1483
02:06:41,631 --> 02:06:45,328
...night's sleepless river.

1484
02:06:45,435 --> 02:06:48,529
At me tugs...
