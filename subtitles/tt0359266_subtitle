1
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:49,746
Who is it?

2
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:55,160
Bihari, like always today
again you are so much drunk.

3
00:01:56,563 --> 00:01:59,430
You will not change.
What are you hiding?

4
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:03,096
Nothing, sir. I have some chapattis.

5
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,104
I was thinking of
distributing it among poor.

6
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:07,299
Okay fine. Go. Go and sleep.

7
00:02:14,714 --> 00:02:19,117
Child? Where were
you taking my child?

8
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:21,120
Tell. Tell you scoundrel.

9
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:25,124
Yes, I am taking your child
to my hut and I have left...

10
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:29,288
...my child in your palace.
Did you understand?

11
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:31,728
This dream of yours will
never be fulfilled, Bihari.

12
00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:33,129
It will be definitely fulfilled,
Thakur. It will be.

13
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,134
I will not allow you to
lead a life of kings...

14
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:38,660
...by taking
possession of my property.

15
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:40,672
I am not responsible
for this, Bihari...

16
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,140
...but it was your own
father responsible for it.

17
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,145
He sold each piece of
his land to my father and...

18
00:02:46,213 --> 00:02:49,273
...wasted the money in
liquor and gambling.

19
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:52,147
We have not snatched
this property from...

20
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:54,153
...you but we have
brought it from your father.

21
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:58,555
Thakur, if the
father has sold it then...

22
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:02,083
...the son will obtain it back again.

23
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:05,091
I will see to it
that my son becomes...

24
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:07,429
...the heir to this property.

25
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:12,768
And your son will lead a
life of paupers like me.

26
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,238
You unfaithful one.

27
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,324
Keep crying child. You will
keep crying like this through...

28
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:42,732
...out your life and my son will
become a king when he grows up.

29
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,733
Child Raja, you
have turned ten today.

30
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:53,676
Wish you a very happy birthday.

31
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:58,150
Mom, today is my birthday too.

32
00:03:58,218 --> 00:04:00,152
Then why didn't you
celebrate my birthday?

33
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:06,153
You wretched, this is written
in his destiny. In his destiny.

34
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:09,093
He will become the king of Chandpur...

35
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:10,220
...and you are very bad fortuned.

36
00:04:10,297 --> 00:04:13,232
You will always serve him
and be a servant to him ever.

37
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,097
Coming, mistress.

38
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:20,366
Son, be careful. This
horse may drop you down.

39
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,103
Mom, the one who won't
listen to me, will be flayed.

40
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:28,647
Go. Go inside.
- Okay, mom.

41
00:04:35,522 --> 00:04:36,580
Child, I hope you are not hurt.

42
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:40,114
You bastard, have you
gone blind. Can't you see?

43
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:45,721
How dare you? You have
hit my mother. My mother.

44
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,460
Say sorry to my mother. Say sorry.

45
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,468
Kishan, mind you if you
raise your hand on my son.

46
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,270
You always keep
hitting my innocent son.

47
00:04:56,343 --> 00:04:58,140
Bihari, your son takes undue...

48
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:01,476
...advantage of our love and favors.

49
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:05,416
I am very ashamed, madam. He
is getting spoilt day by day.

50
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:08,153
It is not good for him
to stay here otherwise...

51
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:10,416
...even Kumar will get
spoilt in his company.

52
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,425
Just tomorrow I will
send him to his uncle.

53
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:16,553
No. No. I will not
allow my Kishan my go.

54
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,622
I will not allow my dear
son to be separated from me.

55
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:25,160
Come what may I will
definitely take that bastard with me.

56
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:27,365
Then take me also. I beg of you.

57
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,308
Take out all his anger
on me. Cut me to pieces...

58
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:33,778
...but don't do this
oppression on me. Please don't do it.

59
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:36,441
Now how do I explain it to you,
you wretched woman?

60
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:44,451
That... That... That
bastard Kishan is not your son.

61
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:48,125
What?
- Yes, do you remember you and hte...

62
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:51,721
...mistress gave birth to
children at the same time?

63
00:05:51,798 --> 00:05:56,792
The same night I exchanged the kids.

64
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:02,339
You have committed such a big sin.

65
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:07,613
I have not committed any sin.
I got my son his rights.

66
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:14,211
No. This is not possible. I
will never allow this to happen.

67
00:06:14,287 --> 00:06:19,418
Kishan is the right owner
of that property, not Kumar.

68
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:21,619
I'll go right now and tell
everything to the mistress.

69
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:28,294
You bastard, I have won my battle.

70
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:34,698
Tell. Tell. Tell me that you
won't reveeal this to anyone.

71
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:37,242
I will reveal. I will reveal.

72
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,175
No. No, you will not reveal anything.

73
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:42,510
I am indebted to her.
I am indebted to her.

74
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:45,779
No. No. You will not tell.
- I am indebted...

75
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:02,526
You cannot speak now.
This is your punishment.

76
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:06,205
You wanted to snatch
the right of my son...

77
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:10,208
...and God snatched
your voice from you.

78
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:21,552
Mom. Mom, are you upset with me?

79
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:25,489
Mom, if you want beat me,
but don't separate me from you.

80
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:28,493
Mom, from today I will
never raise my hand on anyone.

81
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:31,689
Mom, from today I will
never raise my hand on anyone.

82
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:34,700
Mom, beat me. Please
forgive me once, mom.

83
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:38,499
Mom, say something.
Mom, say something please.

84
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:41,768
Just once, mom. Just
forgive me once, mom.

85
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:45,106
Speak something, mom. Mom,
unless you don't call me...

86
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:50,241
...I will never return back,
mom. Never, mom.

87
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:52,113
Come. Come. Make it fast.
Otherwise we'll miss the train.

88
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:54,119
Come fast. Come.

89
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:16,073
Bombay central. Two purses,
twenty rupees.

90
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:20,545
Twenty rupees. Go. Get lost.

91
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:30,418
Grant road. C'mon tell.

92
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,152
Sir, I found this made
of brass from the temple.

93
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:35,091
Brass. What generation has come?

94
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:37,686
People even do cheating with God.

95
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:40,699
Before it used to be made of
gold now it is made of brass.

96
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:46,569
Listen chotanki, from
tomorrow put him on duty near Dadar.

97
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,107
Did people do this to you?

98
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:52,110
No. No. No. I will not steal.
I will not steal.

99
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:53,702
You will not do it?
- Yes, I won't do it.

100
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,240
Santacruz, get up. Tell me
why do you steal things?

101
00:08:58,318 --> 00:09:00,115
Master, if I don't steal then my...

102
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:05,384
Did you listen? You
too have a poor mother.

103
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,394
If you don't earn for her
then she will die of hunger.

104
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:13,063
Tell. Should I write
your name or strike it...

105
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:15,259
...off or should I
tell to your father?

106
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:17,599
Tell. Should I write your
name or should I strike it off?

107
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,331
No. No. Don't strike off my name.

108
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:23,335
I will do everything
for the sake of mother.

109
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:25,468
I will do everything
for the sake of mother.

110
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:40,424
Thief. Catch. Thief. Catch.
Catch. Catch.

111
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:55,373
My purse. - You bastard, you
teach small kids to steal.

112
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:58,171
Don't hit me. I didn't
steal anything. Listen to me.

113
00:09:58,244 --> 00:10:00,109
Listen to me. I have
not stolen anything.

114
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:04,113
What happened?

115
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:06,117
He stole a girl's purse.
- No. My father is not a thief.

116
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:07,652
No. My father is not a thief.

117
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:12,121
Constable, I have not done the theft.

118
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:13,783
What ever you want to say,
say it in the police station.

119
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,122
Come to the police station.

120
00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:18,129
Child, you wait here. I'll be back.
- Father.

121
00:10:18,197 --> 00:10:21,132
C'mon, move. Move.

122
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,794
My father is not a thief.
My father is not a thief.

123
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:27,272
Good, my child. Come with me.

124
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,138
He is innocent. The police
is taking him. Save him.

125
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:32,473
Don't worry. I will take his bail.

126
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:33,603
Will you take bail for him?

127
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,138
I will take his bail and
ruin his entire house.

128
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:40,811
Don't commit such a sin.
Don't commit such a sin.

129
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:46,154
My father is not a thief. My
father is not a thief. He is not.

130
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:47,624
You Chinchpokli.

131
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,165
Why are you getting
drenched in the rain?

132
00:10:56,235 --> 00:11:00,171
My father is not a thief. My
father is not a thief. He is not.

133
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:06,110
They have taken my father to
police station. He is not a thief.

134
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:11,247
I swear I will pay
for the obligation...

135
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,114
...which I have on your father.

136
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:14,244
My father is not a thief.

137
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:21,124
Who are you?
- I am a stranger.

138
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:23,662
Stranger?
- Are you not feeling hungry?

139
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,721
I have not eaten
anything since morning.

140
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:27,265
Come. Let us eat together.

141
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,734
Half, half.
- Fifty-fifty.

142
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:37,600
Fifty-fifty.

143
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,527
I have to go. I will have to go.

144
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:46,538
Stranger, don't leave me.
Don't leave me and go.

145
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:58,479
A very big ambassador is
coming to our hotel, inspector.

146
00:13:58,551 --> 00:14:00,212
Are all the
arrangements up to the mark?

147
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:03,483
Yes, sir. - Security, CID,
police is scattered on all sides.

148
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:06,081
Even the biggest thief
in the world will not...

149
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:08,093
...dare to come here.
- Thank you. Thank you.

150
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:13,090
Hi excellency, welcome. Your
excellency, grace our hotel.

151
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,101
We will try our best to
serve your excellency.

152
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:17,693
Welcome. Welcome.

153
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:24,302
Come. Come. Come.

154
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:50,128
One, two, three, four, five.

155
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,401
Come with me. Hurry up. Hurry up.

156
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:01,070
What happened, inspector?
- Don't worry, madam.

157
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:03,081
What don't worry? Start the lift.

158
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:04,343
Just a minute, sir. Is there anyone?

159
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:11,222
Is there anyone?
- Slave is present.

160
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:14,087
Who are you?
- Lift man.

161
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,220
Why did the lift stop?
- The weight has become too much.

162
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:18,354
The lift is meant for ten
people and you are saying...

163
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:20,092
...with three people
the weight has increased.

164
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,100
The weight didn't increase
because of three persons...

165
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:24,102
...but because of these
diamonds worth 300 thousand.

166
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,694
That's why I have come
to reduce the weight.

167
00:15:25,771 --> 00:15:29,104
Excuse me, madam. Smile.
- Nonsense. My diamonds.

168
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:40,371
Hare Rama. Rama.
Rama ho Rama. Rama.

169
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:45,383
Hare Krishna. Krishna, Krishna.

170
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:49,387
I've become an
ascetic by renouncing.

171
00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:57,662
I've become an ascetic by
renouncing the entire world.

172
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:03,464
I don't have any enmity with
others nor love with our own.

173
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:06,471
I've become an
ascetic by renouncing.

174
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:12,136
I've become an ascetic by
renouncing the entire world.

175
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:18,081
I don't have any enmity with
others nor love with our own.

176
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,085
I've become an
ascetic by renouncing.

177
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:26,557
Hare Rama. Rama.
Rama oh Rama. Rama.

178
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:32,291
Hare Krishna. Krishna. Krishna.

179
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:15,403
These attachments and
these traps of greed

180
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:19,342
These attachments and
these traps of greed

181
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:23,544
All are fools to fall in this trap.

182
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:30,418
Sell happiness and
buy pain and sorrows.

183
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:33,287
Sell happiness and
buy pain and sorrows.

184
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:39,093
World is that market.
World is that market.

185
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:44,626
I've become an ascetic by
renouncing the entire world.

186
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:47,501
I've become an
ascetic by renouncing.

187
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,757
At every step the
heart is deceived.

188
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,761
At every step the
heart is deceived.

189
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:54,638
Who will show me the way now?

190
00:19:56,375 --> 00:20:04,373
This life without vision is like...

191
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,112
Like a boat without a rudder.

192
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:10,121
Like a boat without a rudder.

193
00:20:59,238 --> 00:21:03,106
The childhood is like
a doll made of glass.

194
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:08,704
And the youth is
like a packet of magic.

195
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:15,716
The doll broke and
the packet opened.

196
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:18,120
The doll broke and
the packet opened.

197
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,454
The doll is helpless.
The doll is helpless.

198
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:29,127
I've become an ascetic by
renouncing the entire world.

199
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:34,468
I've become an ascetic by
renouncing the entire world.

200
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,807
I don't have enmity with
others nor love with our own.

201
00:21:39,878 --> 00:21:44,747
I've become an
ascetic by renouncing.

202
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:48,150
Rama, Rama, Rama ho Rama. Rama.

203
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,623
Krishna. Krishna, Krishna.

204
00:21:53,492 --> 00:21:58,759
Rama, Rama. Rama ho Rama. Rama.

205
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:03,564
Krishna. Krishna, Krishna.

206
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:09,097
Rama, Rama. Rama ho Rama. Rama.

207
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:14,373
Krishna. Krishna, Krishna.

208
00:22:22,521 --> 00:22:25,115
This is our area. If I see
you again I'll break your...

209
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:28,182
...hands and legs and give it
in your hands. Understood?

210
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,129
Very nice. I agree. This
is what is called manly.

211
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:35,723
Shake hands. From today we
both we'll share fifty-fifty.

212
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:40,128
Fifty-fifty.

213
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:43,402
'Fifty-fifty. This
girl can't be her.'

214
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:49,213
You won't understand my problem.

215
00:22:49,281 --> 00:22:51,146
Please understand my problems...

216
00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:54,549
But trust me, I'll
return each penny of yours.

217
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,612
But when will you give it?
In your next birth?

218
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,488
Whenever I come, you
return me empty handed.

219
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,091
Wait for some days.

220
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:09,158
You will not listen like this. I
am giving you the last warning.

221
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:12,101
If you return the
money within one day...

222
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:15,231
...then I'll burn you with this stove.

223
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:17,241
Or else I'll hit you
and turn you bald.

224
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:22,110
What did you say oh bald one,
will you turn my father bald?

225
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:25,116
Today I just removed your
wig but if you say it again...

226
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,119
...I will remove your brain
from your head. Understood?

227
00:23:28,187 --> 00:23:30,451
Child, I was just
giving tea to your father.

228
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:32,649
You rascal, you were making tea.

229
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:35,125
Go straight away.

230
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:38,129
Otherwise if I slap
you once you will keep...

231
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:40,529
...rotating like a fan for six months.

232
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:44,126
Dear, one shouldn't speak
like this to big people.

233
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:48,139
Who big people? There
might not be anyone...

234
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:51,540
...wicked or cheap than
this person in entire India.

235
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,477
This man who gave us the house
on rent for 10 thousand...

236
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:56,138
...then later he gave...

237
00:23:56,215 --> 00:23:59,150
...us a loan of 20 thousand
and increased the interest...

238
00:23:59,218 --> 00:24:01,083
...and the rate to 50 thousand...

239
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:05,089
And you call this person good man.

240
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:08,558
You bald one, take your
wig and get lost from here.

241
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:10,424
Get lost. Go out.

242
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:15,297
Now I am going. I will see you later.

243
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:17,096
What will you see? I keep 1760...

244
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:19,637
...men like you in my pocket.

245
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:22,367
Get lost from here.
Get lost. Get lost.

246
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:27,174
Mind you if I don't make you
talk like a wild pigeon in court.

247
00:24:34,186 --> 00:24:37,246
I had told you, our son
will become a big man.

248
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:45,129
I don't want anything mother.
I just want your affection...

249
00:24:45,197 --> 00:24:48,724
...your lap, the dust below your feet.

250
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:53,602
I wish that you should
always remain happy. Always.

251
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:59,667
And mom, I want to see
the smile on your lips.

252
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:03,681
I always want to see
happiness on your face.

253
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,547
Your son, Kishan.

254
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:15,684
You are so lucky. Your
son loves you so much.

255
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:21,494
You always want to tell me something.

256
00:25:23,168 --> 00:25:25,102
Whenever I speak about your son...

257
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,161
...you want to tell me something.

258
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:30,436
After all, what you want to say?

259
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:37,109
Nothing. Nothing. She was dumb...

260
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:40,583
...now even her brain has got ruined.

261
00:25:40,652 --> 00:25:44,713
She even keeps asking me
questions this way. Come.

262
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:49,183
Mistress, your son
is waiting for you.

263
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:02,331
You were ruining my entire
life's hard work and my desire.

264
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:06,070
Mind you, if you attempt to do
like this again. Understood?

265
00:26:25,364 --> 00:26:29,095
You wretched woman.
Whenever I am leaving for...

266
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,158
...some work, you come in
the way like a black cat.

267
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:40,105
Mom. Where is mother? I am
asking you, where is my mom?

268
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:51,115
Mom, you are sitting here and I am...

269
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:52,247
...searching you here and there.

270
00:26:52,324 --> 00:26:57,261
Oh my son!
- My dear mom. My loving mom.

271
00:26:57,329 --> 00:27:00,264
What's the matter? Today you
are expressing so much love.

272
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:04,462
Mom, I always love you
so much. Don't I? - Yes.

273
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:07,403
Mom, give me some money.

274
00:27:07,472 --> 00:27:10,464
How much money do you need?
- 500 thousand.

275
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:13,067
500 thousand? You had
taken this much amount just...

276
00:27:13,145 --> 00:27:16,137
...some days back. What will
you do with so much money?

277
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:22,285
The thing is sir is
sowing a field of money.

278
00:27:22,354 --> 00:27:25,687
If he sows thousands,
he will reap millions.

279
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:28,089
He has started a new business.
- Yes, mother.

280
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:34,096
Wait. I'll just get it.
- My dear mom.

281
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:39,228
Why are you dropping
saliva like a dog?

282
00:27:39,304 --> 00:27:41,101
Take this. Your reward.

283
00:27:45,711 --> 00:27:48,703
Take child. These are the
earnings of my entire life.

284
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,113
I had kept it for you. Now I
am giving it in your hands.

285
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:57,121
Mom, don't worry. Today I am
taking this money in hand...

286
00:27:57,189 --> 00:27:58,383
...and tomorrow I'll bring
them loading in a truck.

287
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:02,058
Keep my things in the car.
I have to leave for Bombay.

288
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:06,591
Okay, I am leaving mom.
- May you have a long life!

289
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:27,618
Sir. Sir. Wife is missing
from the house. - What? - Yes.

290
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:29,677
I searched everywhere. But
I didn't find her anywhere.

291
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:31,484
Where she must have gone?

292
00:28:33,158 --> 00:28:36,685
Surely she must have gone
to Bombay to meet her son.

293
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:43,366
Yes, play child. I
give a shot of 500.

294
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:49,096
You play very safe. 10,000.

295
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:53,507
Looks like he brought
the money looting a bank.

296
00:28:53,578 --> 00:28:56,103
And I pack.

297
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:59,378
Whatever you got, we'll start
the game. You should also start.

298
00:29:35,287 --> 00:29:39,087
Friend, a game of 1000
or 2000 is played by kids.

299
00:29:39,157 --> 00:29:42,752
Let's play a manly game.
500 thousand at shot.

300
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:51,095
I'll bring guarantee
for 500 thousands...

301
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:53,296
...from the manager and after that...

302
00:29:53,371 --> 00:29:56,101
Excuse me. Are you
going to change the cards?

303
00:29:56,174 --> 00:30:01,168
No. I was going to change my destiny.

304
00:30:01,246 --> 00:30:04,443
Keep these cards. I'll
be back in a moment.

305
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:37,679
This is the guarantee
for 500 thousand. Here.

306
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:41,743
Three aces.

307
00:30:49,561 --> 00:30:51,620
Sixes can never become lucky.

308
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,826
This is called being lucky.

309
00:31:02,307 --> 00:31:05,765
I am the right owner of this money.

310
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:12,439
Put the counters and
the money in my account.

311
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:19,123
Sir, has come. Only he
understands the pain of poor.

312
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,123
God will always keep
you happy. Always happy.

313
00:31:34,606 --> 00:31:38,474
Mother, pray that my
mother should always be happy.

314
00:31:57,762 --> 00:32:00,162
You had come to meet your son.

315
00:32:32,264 --> 00:32:33,731
This is my area. Understood?

316
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:37,131
If you want to come here,
you need to take my permit...

317
00:32:37,202 --> 00:32:39,136
...otherwise you should
take the beatings and leave.

318
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:49,211
You idiot, leave.

319
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:35,119
Mother, who were those men?

320
00:33:39,197 --> 00:33:41,461
Looks like she is into a
big trouble. Come with me.

321
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:46,133
Child, again you have
done something. Who is this?

322
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:50,197
Father, she is a troubled woman.

323
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:52,470
I brought her to give
her support for some days.

324
00:33:52,544 --> 00:33:54,136
One who is oneself
without any support...

325
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:56,146
...can lend what support to others?

326
00:33:56,214 --> 00:33:57,738
I didn't understand, father.

327
00:33:57,816 --> 00:34:01,217
Today again the landlord
had come to ask for rent.

328
00:34:01,286 --> 00:34:02,548
He has given us 24 hours time.

329
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,212
Now you only tell what I should do?

330
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:06,223
Father, let the landlord go to hell.

331
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:12,628
A wild pigeon has come to this city.

332
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:15,097
If I cut his wings
then leave alone 50,000...

333
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:18,499
...I will be able to get 500 thousand.

334
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:32,444
Come, sir. It is your shop.

335
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:34,451
You are a very
idiotic kind of person.

336
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:36,111
Don't you know the
prince of a place is...

337
00:34:36,187 --> 00:34:38,655
...called your honor
and not sir? Understood?

338
00:34:38,723 --> 00:34:40,190
Of which place are you the prince?

339
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:45,127
I am the last prince of Chandpur,
Surat Singh.

340
00:34:45,196 --> 00:34:46,458
Come. Come.

341
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:48,123
See, It is my beloved's birthday.

342
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:51,134
So I want to select a
necklace for her which is dazzling...

343
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:53,136
...with diamonds, shining
with pearls, expressing love.

344
00:34:53,204 --> 00:34:55,263
Hurry up. I have no time.

345
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,807
What are you seeing? Show him...

346
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,137
...some nice, expensive necklace.

347
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:01,269
This is worth 25,000.
- This is for 25,000.

348
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:02,404
And this one is worth 50,000.

349
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,345
And this is worth 75,000.

350
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:06,077
What's this 25, 50, 75 thousand.

351
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:07,482
Are you selling
diamonds or vegetables?

352
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:09,349
This much we put in the
necks of our cows and buffaloes.

353
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:11,412
Cows and buffaloes?
- Yes, cows and buffaloes.

354
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:13,616
Show me some expensive necklace.
Expensive.

355
00:35:15,293 --> 00:35:18,490
Take out the big necklace
worth one million. Make it fast.

356
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:25,096
See this. This is the
necklace worth one million.

357
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:29,106
I am sure my fiancee will
definitely like this necklace.

358
00:35:29,174 --> 00:35:33,167
I liked what you selected.
- You?

359
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:37,442
Yes, me.
- But who are you?

360
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:43,513
Me? I am his fiancee
and he is my beloved.

361
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:49,322
I am his heartthrob.
He values diamonds...

362
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:52,124
...and my eyes are deceptive.

363
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:55,530
Dear, will you not
take the gift of love?

364
00:35:57,535 --> 00:35:59,127
What is happening?

365
00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:02,071
Pack the necklace and
I'll give you a cheque.

366
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,404
I don't want cheque,
but cash. Only cash.

367
00:36:04,476 --> 00:36:09,072
Okay. Then tomorrow my
secretary will come and give...

368
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:13,083
...one million cash and
then you can pack my necklace.

369
00:36:13,151 --> 00:36:16,552
C'mon darling. Let's go.

370
00:36:18,423 --> 00:36:21,085
Just a minute.
- What happened?

371
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,217
Where is the necklace?

372
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:26,089
Necklace? - Which necklace?
- The one worth one million.

373
00:36:26,164 --> 00:36:29,099
It's not with us.
- Then it is not even here.

374
00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:32,095
What are you seeing here?

375
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,104
Leave alone touching
with hands, we don't touch...

376
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:35,434
...such a necklace even with our legs.

377
00:36:35,507 --> 00:36:36,565
C'mon darling.

378
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:40,771
Don't force me so much that I
should call the police. Wait.

379
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:42,369
Leave alone police,
call the military.

380
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:44,108
We have not stolen anything.
Why should we be afraid?

381
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:49,643
I'll just show it to you.
- Church gate police station.

382
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:52,383
I am calling from
jewelers Narbheram Mirawala.

383
00:36:52,457 --> 00:36:53,515
A diamond necklace
worth one million...

384
00:36:53,591 --> 00:36:55,115
...has been stolen from my shop.

385
00:36:55,193 --> 00:36:57,593
Fine. You wait there
and I'll just come.

386
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:04,328
Come.
- Is your name Mr. Rasilal? - Yes.

387
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:06,529
Did you call us?
- Yes, I had called you up.

388
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:09,129
I had shown them the necklace and...

389
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:11,732
...during our conversation
the necklace went missing.

390
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:14,277
Mind you. You hid it
yourself and now blaming us.

391
00:37:14,345 --> 00:37:16,336
You both will have to come
to the police station with me.

392
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:20,214
And you also. - You take them
and I'll be there in a while.

393
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:23,083
You Rasilal, I will teach
you such a lesson that today...

394
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:25,088
...you are selling
diamonds and tomorrow you...

395
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:27,488
...will be seen selling
tomatoes on the road.

396
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:31,154
C'mon, inspector. I am ready.
- Tomato?

397
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,772
Rasilal? - Yes. - Did you
call Church gate police station?

398
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:55,114
Yes. I had given a call. - Your
diamond necklace is missing? - Yes.

399
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:56,312
Where are those people?
- Those people?

400
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:58,514
The police has taken those people.

401
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,114
But we have just come.
- You have just come? - Yes.

402
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,724
...one million and
false police personnel.

403
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:10,056
Great my false police man.
Here is your reward.

404
00:38:10,134 --> 00:38:13,592
I told Kishan's plan of
stealing the necklace to Mary.

405
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:15,400
And Mary even stole the necklace.

406
00:38:15,473 --> 00:38:18,465
But Kishan is a very intelligent
man. He will surely obtain it.

407
00:38:18,543 --> 00:38:23,071
You are very lucky. If
you Kishan is intelligent...

408
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:28,084
...then even my Mary is no less.

409
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:32,480
Take this, your reward.

410
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:43,491
Today I really
appreciate this plan of yours.

411
00:38:48,773 --> 00:38:51,298
Oh villagers! Today is an auspicious
day Is it or not? - Yes, it is.

412
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:53,105
From both of us today
there will be free...

413
00:38:53,177 --> 00:38:55,771
...flow of liquor for
the entire village.

414
00:38:57,515 --> 00:38:59,380
I will also drink.

415
00:39:01,786 --> 00:39:05,654
Will you also drink or what?
- I will also drink and you too.

416
00:39:09,127 --> 00:39:10,253
Listen. Listen.

417
00:39:39,157 --> 00:39:45,289
Let go of my hand. Let go
of my hand and let me drink.

418
00:39:45,363 --> 00:39:50,164
Let me drink. Let me drink.
Let me drink.

419
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:53,431
Let go of my hand
and let me drink.

420
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:58,237
Let me drink. Let me drink.
Let me drink.

421
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:01,767
Don't wink your eyes.
Let me live.

422
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:06,442
Let me live. Let me live.
Let me live.

423
00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:11,181
Come here. Come here. Come here.

424
00:40:11,255 --> 00:40:16,124
No. No. Some one will see.
Be there. Be there.

425
00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:20,130
Let go of my hand
and let me drink.

426
00:41:01,572 --> 00:41:06,168
I am very innocent.
I am very innocent...

427
00:41:06,244 --> 00:41:08,439
...and this rascal is back of me.

428
00:41:08,513 --> 00:41:11,311
He gives something
else and you abuse him.

429
00:41:11,382 --> 00:41:14,442
I am innocent and a
rascal is back of me.

430
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:17,647
He gives something else
and you give him abuses.

431
00:41:17,722 --> 00:41:21,123
What do you keep
staring without blinking?

432
00:41:21,192 --> 00:41:24,252
What do you keep
staring without blinking?

433
00:41:24,328 --> 00:41:28,128
Now you have attained
your youth in totality.

434
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:37,200
Save me from this scoundrel.
Scoundrel. Scoundrel.

435
00:41:37,275 --> 00:41:40,472
Let go of my hand
and let me drink.

436
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:45,346
Let me drink. Let me drink.
Let me drink.

437
00:42:33,397 --> 00:42:36,127
I am alone.

438
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:41,336
I am alone and there are so
many companions with you.

439
00:42:41,405 --> 00:42:45,808
I don't understand Hindi,
speak in Marathi.

440
00:42:45,877 --> 00:42:51,144
I am alone and there are
many companions with you.

441
00:42:51,215 --> 00:42:55,549
I don't understand Hindi,
speak in Marathi.

442
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:59,283
Where's the need of
Hindi or Marathi in love?

443
00:42:59,357 --> 00:43:02,292
Where's the need of
Hindi or Marathi in love?

444
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,693
Speak with your hands
and don't hold my wrist.

445
00:43:07,298 --> 00:43:15,296
Hug me today. Hug me.
Hug me. Hug me.

446
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:18,433
Let go of my hand and
let me drink.

447
00:43:18,509 --> 00:43:23,173
Let me drink. Let me drink.
Let me drink.

448
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:26,444
Don't wink your
eyes and let me live.

449
00:43:26,517 --> 00:43:31,250
Let me live. Let me live.
Let me live.

450
00:43:31,322 --> 00:43:36,521
Come here. Come here.

451
00:43:36,594 --> 00:43:40,462
No. No. Some one will see.
Be there. Be there.

452
00:43:40,531 --> 00:43:43,329
Come here. Come here.

453
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:46,666
No. No. Be there. Be there.

454
00:43:46,737 --> 00:43:49,672
Come here. Come here.

455
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:53,471
No. No. Be there. Be there.

456
00:44:21,706 --> 00:44:24,106
You used of think of
yourself as a very big goon.

457
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:30,711
Bring the car inside, rascal.

458
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:37,583
False police, artificial liquor,
false hotel and this real money

459
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:41,648
Take this, Rashit. Have fun. Go.

460
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:26,496
The girl was a thief and even
the entire locality a deception.

461
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,568
I will not leave you,
girl. I will not leave you.

462
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:55,724
This is the house.

463
00:46:00,738 --> 00:46:03,730
Mother, you are everything for me.

464
00:46:05,142 --> 00:46:08,475
You are my God, my Durga, my Laxmi.

465
00:46:08,546 --> 00:46:14,075
Mom, I can fight
with the entire world...

466
00:46:14,151 --> 00:46:15,413
...but not with your seperation.

467
00:46:16,287 --> 00:46:24,422
Once. Just once come to me.
Hug me. Just once.

468
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:30,156
Bless me mother, so that I
should have a small house...

469
00:46:30,234 --> 00:46:33,101
...in which you should be
with me and I should keep...

470
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:35,570
...the happiness of the
entire world at your feet.

471
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:38,107
And spend my entire
life in worshipping you.

472
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:41,110
I should spend my entire
life in worshipping you, mom.

473
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:04,067
So, now you have
got so much courage.

474
00:47:04,135 --> 00:47:06,126
You went to Bombay
to meet your Kishan.

475
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:08,535
He is neither related to you
by blood nor is he your son.

476
00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:11,074
Listen to one more thing carefully.

477
00:47:11,142 --> 00:47:17,342
If you try to reveal the secret
to Kishan, then I will kill him.

478
00:47:20,151 --> 00:47:21,209
I hope you understood.

479
00:47:32,163 --> 00:47:34,757
Oh God! What sort
of darkness is this?

480
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:38,431
What sort of test you
are taking of my affection?

481
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:44,098
When he was being separated
from me, I couldn't stop him...

482
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:47,239
...and today I couldn't meet
him even after reaching till him.

483
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:52,509
I am dumb, but you
even dumber than me, God.

484
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:56,110
You are even dumber than me.
Even dumber than me.

485
00:48:06,397 --> 00:48:07,455
Mother.

486
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:43,757
'My mom must be
definitely in some trouble.'

487
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:56,112
Mom. See your Kishan
has come, mom. Mom.

488
00:49:25,342 --> 00:49:31,542
Mom, forgive me if
I made any mistake.

489
00:49:31,615 --> 00:49:34,413
Mom, how did your hand got burnt?

490
00:49:36,153 --> 00:49:38,553
Tell, mom. Why are you quiet?

491
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:41,556
How did your hand get burnt?

492
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:45,220
These old and torn clothes, this
burnt hand, these swollen eyes.

493
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:50,496
Looks like, looks like, you
have borne lot of sorrows.

494
00:49:52,236 --> 00:49:55,433
Mom, have you working
as a laborer or what?

495
00:49:56,707 --> 00:49:58,106
Tell me, mom. The money which I...

496
00:49:58,175 --> 00:50:00,109
...had been sending
was enough for you.

497
00:50:00,177 --> 00:50:02,111
Then why did your
condition become like this?

498
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:08,117
Tell, mom. What condition
you have made of yourself?

499
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:13,521
Tell, mom. Why are
you quiet? Speak to me.

500
00:50:14,191 --> 00:50:16,250
What ever sorrows and troubles you...

501
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:18,522
...have in your heart,
give them to your son.

502
00:50:18,595 --> 00:50:20,392
Speak to me once, mom.

503
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:25,124
Lord Ram left his home for
14 years on his mother's...

504
00:50:25,202 --> 00:50:29,138
...saying and I have
spent 20 years away from you.

505
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:33,142
Just once, mom. Speak
to me once otherwise...

506
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,269
...l'll think that you
are still upset with me.

507
00:50:36,213 --> 00:50:39,148
If your son leaves today then
he will directly go into the...

508
00:50:39,216 --> 00:50:42,151
...darkness of death and he
will never again return, mom.

509
00:50:42,219 --> 00:50:46,155
Tell me. Tell me, what
sorrow you have? Tell me.

510
00:50:49,493 --> 00:50:52,485
You can't speak or what?
- No.

511
00:51:01,438 --> 00:51:06,375
These tears in your eyes.
You wretched. - Mom.

512
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:12,110
Your oppressions have
snatched her voice from her.

513
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:18,118
You bastard, you swine.
And taking advantage of...

514
00:51:18,188 --> 00:51:22,249
...her dumbness, you
separated her from his child.

515
00:51:25,195 --> 00:51:27,595
My name is Kishan.
- Kishan.

516
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,598
Today 20 years have passed by.

517
00:51:32,669 --> 00:51:35,467
The childhood has turned to youth...

518
00:51:36,206 --> 00:51:37,537
...but you have not changed.

519
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:39,599
How I would have changed, big mom?

520
00:51:40,811 --> 00:51:47,148
I left my childhood over
here and today when I retuned...

521
00:51:47,217 --> 00:51:50,152
...it felt as if the
childhood clanged to me and...

522
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:53,155
...I cried terribly the way
I cried in my childhood.

523
00:51:53,223 --> 00:51:54,485
What are you trying to say?

524
00:51:57,561 --> 00:51:59,153
I saw the same
oppressions on my mother...

525
00:51:59,229 --> 00:52:01,094
...which I found on
her in my childhood.

526
00:52:01,165 --> 00:52:03,156
Everything is the same.

527
00:52:04,168 --> 00:52:06,102
When nothing changed over here...

528
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:08,104
...then how I could
have changed, big mom?

529
00:52:08,172 --> 00:52:12,108
What oppression has been
done on her? Ask your mother.

530
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:14,101
If she would have been
capable of telling...

531
00:52:14,178 --> 00:52:17,443
...something then, why
this day would have come?

532
00:52:17,514 --> 00:52:20,176
Get lost from here. Get lost.

533
00:52:21,652 --> 00:52:25,315
I am going, but I am
taking my mother along.

534
00:52:25,389 --> 00:52:29,189
Come, mom. Come. The world
made by God is very big.

535
00:52:29,259 --> 00:52:32,592
Don't worry. Your son
is with you, mom. Come.

536
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,395
Daddy, I have 500
thousand in my fist.

537
00:52:40,471 --> 00:52:44,339
From today you are the father
of the princess of Chandpur.

538
00:52:44,408 --> 00:52:46,399
You are a king.

539
00:53:08,565 --> 00:53:11,500
You have broken it.
What have you done?

540
00:53:11,568 --> 00:53:13,297
Someone call the police.

541
00:53:16,707 --> 00:53:18,572
Chandpur. Princess of Chandpur.

542
00:53:20,177 --> 00:53:24,637
The princess of Chandpur
has come to our hotel.

543
00:53:50,674 --> 00:53:53,142
Me.
- Good morning. Greetings.

544
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:54,268
Where am I?

545
00:54:00,551 --> 00:54:04,078
Don't be scared. It's we. I
am the manager of this hotel.

546
00:54:04,154 --> 00:54:08,215
He is a doctor. He
has come to treat you.

547
00:54:08,292 --> 00:54:12,092
Don't be scared, miss princess.
- What miss?

548
00:54:12,162 --> 00:54:16,098
Miss princess.
- See, I am not a princess.

549
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:20,102
Princess, we know that you
are the princess of Chandpur.

550
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:22,434
It is our good fortune
that your car broke...

551
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:24,770
...the door of our
hotel and came inside.

552
00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:26,233
I hope I was not lying.

553
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:27,504
What is this story of princess?

554
00:54:27,578 --> 00:54:32,777
Case of Amnesia.
- Oh! You mean...

555
00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:36,114
Oh! Shut up. By that
the stomach is cleansed.

556
00:54:36,186 --> 00:54:37,778
Here the memories have got cleansed.

557
00:54:37,854 --> 00:54:40,448
The princess has lost her memory.

558
00:54:40,524 --> 00:54:42,788
It means the police
will file a case on us.

559
00:54:42,859 --> 00:54:45,794
What do I know? I am a doctor.
Ask some lawyer.

560
00:54:45,862 --> 00:54:48,126
If your hat is removed
and your neck belt is...

561
00:54:48,198 --> 00:54:50,393
...thrown out, then, you
look exactly like a lawyer.

562
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:52,128
And if your spectacles are
sold and the coat is auctioned...

563
00:54:52,202 --> 00:54:54,329
Shut up.
- Oh! Sorry. Sorry.

564
00:54:54,404 --> 00:54:56,269
Princess of Chandpur.

565
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:59,468
Princess of Chandpur has come.

566
00:54:59,543 --> 00:55:02,603
I have to settle
some old dues with her.

567
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:10,083
Come. Come, princess. Most welcome.

568
00:55:10,153 --> 00:55:11,415
One second please.

569
00:55:13,423 --> 00:55:16,153
Remaining people move aside.
Reduce the crowd.

570
00:55:16,226 --> 00:55:19,423
You man with black bow, move aside.

571
00:55:19,496 --> 00:55:23,091
You man with moustache
like a bee, get aside.

572
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:26,101
You tall madam, don't style
your hair but move from there.

573
00:55:26,436 --> 00:55:31,271
Smile a little. Give an
expression of shyness.

574
00:55:35,712 --> 00:55:37,111
I am sorry.

575
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:39,375
You have spoilt the business.

576
00:55:46,189 --> 00:55:48,521
Come. Come. Welcome. Most welcome.

577
00:55:57,467 --> 00:56:01,403
Ladies and gentlemen, today
the princess of Chandpur...

578
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:10,140
...inaugurated our hotel
and increased its glory.

579
00:56:10,213 --> 00:56:12,545
Thank you, your highness.
- Okay, I make a move now.

580
00:56:12,616 --> 00:56:14,083
See our show and go.
- No. Not today.

581
00:56:14,151 --> 00:56:17,086
Today is my fiancees
birthday and unless I don't...

582
00:56:17,154 --> 00:56:20,089
...reach he will not
celebrate his birthday.

583
00:56:20,157 --> 00:56:23,092
Hello. Leave alone birthday,
I will not...

584
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,095
...celebrate even the
death day without you.

585
00:56:26,163 --> 00:56:27,562
Bastard.

586
00:56:28,632 --> 00:56:30,099
I am your fiancee. Wherever you are...

587
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:33,102
...required, I will reach that place.

588
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:35,104
What are you seeing that side?

589
00:56:35,172 --> 00:56:36,639
According to the
tradition of the family...

590
00:56:36,707 --> 00:56:39,232
...it is your duty to give
the gift of love. Isn't it?

591
00:56:39,309 --> 00:56:41,368
I say come, my darling.

592
00:56:41,445 --> 00:56:43,106
I will teach you such a lesson that...

593
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,306
...you will remember it
through out your life.

594
00:56:44,381 --> 00:56:46,110
I have tasted you, now you will...

595
00:56:46,183 --> 00:56:48,378
...remember me throughout your life.

596
00:56:48,452 --> 00:56:50,113
Why are you feeling shy?
We have fallen in love...

597
00:56:50,187 --> 00:56:51,779
...and have not committed some theft.

598
00:56:51,855 --> 00:56:53,117
Even if we have committed a theft...

599
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,181
...then we will handle it with love.

600
00:56:56,293 --> 00:56:59,126
Let go of my hand.
- If you try to get your hands...

601
00:56:59,196 --> 00:57:01,460
...released, then you
will find handcuffs in them.

602
00:57:01,531 --> 00:57:04,329
Remember one thing. Let
the drama of love continue...

603
00:57:04,401 --> 00:57:06,266
...and let the decision
of treasure be taken.

604
00:57:06,336 --> 00:57:07,530
I will never give you the necklace.

605
00:57:07,604 --> 00:57:10,072
No. If you deny then I'll let your...

606
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,471
...secret in front of the public.

607
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:13,406
If I gave an opportunity,
you are taking undue advantage.

608
00:57:13,477 --> 00:57:15,672
Think again. Give me the thing
or else you will get beatings.

609
00:57:15,746 --> 00:57:17,077
I will not give it.

610
00:57:17,147 --> 00:57:20,082
Which language is this?
- This is a special language...

611
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:22,084
...of accounts of our court
which you will not understand.

612
00:57:22,152 --> 00:57:24,677
Princess, I came and
gave you my heart and...

613
00:57:24,755 --> 00:57:26,416
...you have brought this
heart made of leather.

614
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:28,082
Anyways, the colors
of world have changed.

615
00:57:28,158 --> 00:57:29,420
I'll manage with that. C'mon give it.

616
00:57:29,493 --> 00:57:31,484
No.
- Give it. - No. - I say give it.

617
00:59:24,608 --> 00:59:26,542
Promise of love.
- Fifty-fifty.

618
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:28,669
What are your intentions?
- Fifty-fifty.

619
00:59:28,745 --> 00:59:31,213
Half, half.
- Fifty-fifty.

620
00:59:36,152 --> 00:59:40,282
We both are equal.

621
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:44,760
We both are equal.
Neither more nor less.

622
00:59:44,828 --> 00:59:46,693
Promise of love.
- Fifty-fifty.

623
00:59:46,763 --> 00:59:49,163
What are your intentions?
- Fifty-fifty.

624
00:59:49,232 --> 00:59:51,359
Half, half.
- Fifty-fifty.

625
00:59:58,642 --> 01:00:00,371
We both are equal.

626
01:00:00,443 --> 01:00:04,106
We both are equal.
Neither more nor less.

627
01:00:05,315 --> 01:00:07,180
Promise of love.
- Fifty-fifty.

628
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,377
What are your intentions?
- Fifty-fifty.

629
01:00:09,452 --> 01:00:11,579
Half, half.
- Fifty-fifty.

630
01:00:58,234 --> 01:01:02,500
One has to give heart in
return to heart, my king.

631
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:08,168
One has to take half
happiness and half sorrows.

632
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:13,709
One has to give heart in
return to heart, my king.

633
01:01:13,783 --> 01:01:18,117
One has to take half
happiness and half sorrows.

634
01:01:18,188 --> 01:01:23,251
So, it means. It means.
It means. It means.

635
01:02:12,776 --> 01:02:17,713
Wait. Wait, even you
have stolen my peace.

636
01:02:21,518 --> 01:02:26,182
Return it to me as
it belongs to others.

637
01:02:28,191 --> 01:02:33,128
Wait. Even you
have stolen my peace.

638
01:02:33,196 --> 01:02:37,394
Return it to me as
it belongs to others.

639
01:02:37,467 --> 01:02:42,734
So, it means. It means.
It means. It means.

640
01:02:42,806 --> 01:02:44,671
Promise of love.
- Fifty-fifty.

641
01:02:44,741 --> 01:02:47,141
What are your intentions?
- Fifty-fifty.

642
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:49,337
Half, half.
- Fifty-fifty.

643
01:03:38,728 --> 01:03:42,596
Let go of my wrist in public.

644
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:48,193
Don't look at my face,
but look into my eyes.

645
01:03:49,806 --> 01:03:54,140
Let go of my wrist in public.

646
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:58,476
Don't look at my face,
but look into my eyes.

647
01:03:58,548 --> 01:04:03,349
So it means. - It means. -
It means. It means. It means.

648
01:04:03,419 --> 01:04:05,478
Promise of love.
- Fifty-fifty.

649
01:04:05,555 --> 01:04:07,614
What are your intentions?
- Fifty-fifty.

650
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:10,090
Half, half.

01:04:17,167 --> 01:04:18,759
We both are equal.

01:04:32,649 --> 01:04:36,107
Promise of love.

656
01:05:23,499 --> 01:05:25,558
'Let go of father.
- Don't hit me. Don't hit me.'

657
01:05:25,635 --> 01:05:28,229
'I have not stolen anything.
Listen to me. Listen to me.'

658
01:05:28,304 --> 01:05:29,430
'My father is not a thief.'

659
01:05:29,505 --> 01:05:32,702
Sir, my daughter has gone
to arrange money for you...

660
01:05:32,775 --> 01:05:35,505
...and she has still not returned.
Sir, she will come.

661
01:05:35,578 --> 01:05:37,307
No excuse will work now.

662
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:41,783
How many more days should I wait?
Throw his belongings.

663
01:05:41,851 --> 01:05:43,113
Go from here.
- Sir, have mercy.

664
01:05:43,186 --> 01:05:46,121
Don't speak of mercy. There is no...

665
01:05:46,189 --> 01:05:49,181
...mercy even in the house of God.

666
01:05:49,259 --> 01:05:51,659
I say Stop it. Stop it.
- What stop it?

667
01:05:52,795 --> 01:05:54,387
Have mercy on me.
- Get lost.

668
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:59,532
Today, I'll take my money and go.

669
01:05:59,602 --> 01:06:02,469
Sir, my daughter must be coming.
- No excuse will work

670
01:06:05,408 --> 01:06:07,137
Oh lord! Help me.

671
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:10,270
Even your God will not
be able to save you today.

672
01:06:10,346 --> 01:06:12,075
Call your God.

673
01:06:14,684 --> 01:06:17,084
God's name from the mouth of evil.

674
01:06:17,487 --> 01:06:19,079
You ruined so many
lives and today you...

675
01:06:19,155 --> 01:06:21,350
...will beg for your life,
you scoundrel.

676
01:06:22,692 --> 01:06:25,217
Where are you taking the things?
- Who are you?

677
01:06:25,295 --> 01:06:27,092
I had come to your
school 20 years back.

678
01:06:27,163 --> 01:06:29,688
Did you forget your father or what?

679
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:41,636
Good Rehman.

680
01:07:00,129 --> 01:07:01,653
Your man is having a
knife in his hand...

681
01:07:01,731 --> 01:07:03,062
...and I have a
bundle of money in mine.

682
01:07:03,132 --> 01:07:04,599
You can end the battle now.

683
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:06,259
Think. If you want this stop them.

684
01:07:06,336 --> 01:07:08,133
Move back. Move back.

685
01:07:08,204 --> 01:07:10,069
You have come to show bravery in...

686
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:11,538
...the house of a
decent man. Move from here.

687
01:07:21,351 --> 01:07:26,084
Stop, you bald one. Don't
you see he is paying? Go.

688
01:07:36,566 --> 01:07:40,093
Sir, I hope you are not hurt.

689
01:07:43,573 --> 01:07:45,302
Do you need some more money?

690
01:07:46,709 --> 01:07:48,301
Then give the papers of this house.

691
01:07:52,315 --> 01:07:54,306
Kindly, take these also.

692
01:07:57,653 --> 01:07:59,644
Sir, do you need something else also?

693
01:07:59,722 --> 01:08:03,522
No. No. Now even the debt is
cleared and I got the money.

694
01:08:03,593 --> 01:08:05,584
Kindly let me go...

695
01:08:05,661 --> 01:08:07,128
So kindly get lost.

696
01:08:07,196 --> 01:08:10,131
Let me at least
chance to move from here.

697
01:08:16,406 --> 01:08:17,668
Who are you?

698
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:21,608
I had an old debt on me,
that's what I had come to fulfill.

699
01:08:33,756 --> 01:08:36,418
What should I tell my daughter,
if she questions me?

700
01:08:37,593 --> 01:08:42,553
Tell her that fifty-fifty had come.

701
01:08:51,174 --> 01:08:52,232
Where am I?

702
01:08:52,775 --> 01:08:56,176
Don't go anywhere.

703
01:08:56,245 --> 01:09:00,113
Where am I? You are
in our possession.

704
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:10,124
We got you here because we
will auction you in Chandpur.

705
01:09:10,193 --> 01:09:15,130
So that those people
will come running.

706
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:17,723
How will they come?
- They will come in motor.

707
01:09:18,401 --> 01:09:21,199
And we will earn
hundreds of thousands of rupees.

708
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:23,261
We will earn thousands of rupees.

709
01:09:25,141 --> 01:09:28,599
If you do like this then you
will be called the biggest fools.

710
01:09:28,678 --> 01:09:30,077
We will be called fools.

711
01:09:30,146 --> 01:09:34,412
You fools, if you go
to do the dealing for...

712
01:09:34,484 --> 01:09:36,679
...a false princess, then you will
beaten with shoes. - We'll be beaten.

713
01:09:36,752 --> 01:09:38,083
A single hair won't
remain on the head...

714
01:09:38,154 --> 01:09:40,145
...and all your teeth will be broken.

715
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,417
Our teeth will be broken.

716
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:45,093
Don't you believe me?
Come with me to some...

717
01:09:45,161 --> 01:09:48,096
...police station and even you
will be put in along with me.

718
01:09:48,164 --> 01:09:49,563
Even we will be imprisoned.

719
01:09:49,632 --> 01:09:53,090
Yes, my house is in Koliwada slums.

720
01:09:53,169 --> 01:09:55,694
Koliwada slums?
- My father stays there.

721
01:09:55,771 --> 01:10:00,105
If you even go and tell him
he will give you 420 beatings.

722
01:10:00,176 --> 01:10:05,580
He will hit with shoes 420 times.

723
01:10:05,648 --> 01:10:14,454
It means we will not be able
to get one million rupees.

724
01:10:14,524 --> 01:10:17,118
I will give them one million rupees.

725
01:10:17,193 --> 01:10:20,128
It is not more than
the princess life.

726
01:10:20,196 --> 01:10:22,130
Take out one million rupees from...

727
01:10:22,198 --> 01:10:25,258
...the treasury and
give it to the minister.

728
01:10:25,334 --> 01:10:27,802
Just a minute, your highness.

729
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:29,462
Why do you believe that
this girl is the princess?

730
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:32,133
Minister, Tiwari had
eloped with the princess...

731
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:34,540
...twenty years back. Did you forget?

732
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:36,805
And today he is
asking the price for it.

733
01:10:36,879 --> 01:10:39,814
Minister, he has even
written a ransom note behind it.

734
01:10:41,617 --> 01:10:42,743
I want my daughter.

735
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:48,488
A 20 years old story
has started again today.

736
01:10:53,229 --> 01:10:55,493
'Your faithful servant is
still alive, your majesty.'

737
01:10:55,565 --> 01:10:57,430
'Tiwari, take this
child and leave from here.'

738
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,229
'I will handle this Shamsher Singh.'

739
01:11:08,644 --> 01:11:11,704
'There is no use of hiding,
my majesty. Come outside.'

740
01:11:11,781 --> 01:11:13,112
'These blood drops of
yours are unfaithful to you...

741
01:11:13,182 --> 01:11:15,116
...and are revealing
where you have hidden.'

742
01:11:15,184 --> 01:11:17,175
'So, please come outside.'

743
01:11:17,253 --> 01:11:25,126
Your highness, this is an
act of that unfaithful Tiwari.

744
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:30,655
Tiwari? - Yes. And he only
eloped with the princess.

745
01:11:30,733 --> 01:11:34,669
My daughter. Minister, I
want my daughter back.

746
01:11:34,737 --> 01:11:38,138
Don't worry your highness. I
will not leave Tiwari alive...

747
01:11:38,207 --> 01:11:42,541
...even though if he is
hiding in any corner of the world.

748
01:11:42,612 --> 01:11:45,740
I will complete the
work today which...

749
01:11:45,815 --> 01:11:48,409
...I left incomplete 20 years back.

750
01:11:49,819 --> 01:11:54,153
Tiwari has asked one million
rupees for the life of princess.

751
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:57,156
I will kill both of them.

752
01:12:00,162 --> 01:12:03,222
Versova beach, at ten in the night.

753
01:12:16,846 --> 01:12:19,644
These people have really come.

754
01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:22,309
The girl was trying to fool us.

755
01:12:22,385 --> 01:12:24,717
Come. Come, Pathan. Come.

756
01:12:26,322 --> 01:12:29,120
Rupesh, keep an eye everywhere.

757
01:12:30,326 --> 01:12:32,590
I will handle those
people and come back.

758
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:36,395
Okay. Your bag.

759
01:12:40,469 --> 01:12:46,533
One, two.
- Code word. - Let him come in.

760
01:12:49,311 --> 01:12:55,147
Come. Here is your princess.

761
01:12:55,217 --> 01:12:58,209
A bag of magic, princess.

762
01:12:58,287 --> 01:13:00,152
Don't go on her signal.

763
01:13:00,222 --> 01:13:04,420
Take out one million and
take her. Fast. Make it fast.

764
01:13:04,493 --> 01:13:07,360
We don't have time. We are very busy.

765
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:09,762
First tell me where Tiwari is?
- Who Tiwari?

766
01:13:09,832 --> 01:13:15,099
This Tiwari.
- We don't know Tiwari.

767
01:13:15,171 --> 01:13:17,366
First you say
princess and now Tiwari.

768
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:21,570
Take out the money. Why
are you eating our brains?

769
01:13:21,644 --> 01:13:26,172
Why do you want to hit us?

770
01:13:30,186 --> 01:13:32,347
Oh princess, who are these?

771
01:13:37,526 --> 01:13:39,517
Number four, three, nine.

772
01:13:46,235 --> 01:13:47,463
Shamsher.

773
01:13:52,742 --> 01:13:55,472
Mr. Tiwari, the
exit is not that side.

774
01:13:55,745 --> 01:13:57,269
It is this side. This side.

775
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,807
Come, oh faithful
servant of Chandpur.

776
01:14:00,216 --> 01:14:01,410
Did you recognize me?

777
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:04,210
Who can one forget an
unfaithful man like you?

778
01:14:08,691 --> 01:14:10,090
And you know very
well how dangerous...

779
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:11,490
...is the poison of this snake.

780
01:14:12,161 --> 01:14:14,220
It ruins the family and
destroys the property.

781
01:14:15,231 --> 01:14:17,756
If you want your life, then
tell where is the princess?

782
01:14:18,701 --> 01:14:23,263
Tell. - I will not tell. I
will die but I won't tell. - Tell.

783
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,114
The person who says no
to Shamsher Singh...

784
01:14:33,182 --> 01:14:34,706
...knocks on the door
of his death himself.

785
01:14:35,718 --> 01:14:40,348
If you love life, then tell.
This is your last chance.

786
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:42,648
Then listen, Shamsher Singh.

787
01:14:43,726 --> 01:14:46,126
That day when I was
running taking the princess...

788
01:14:46,195 --> 01:14:48,789
...with me, and your
men were following me...

789
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:10,245
I couldn't save her.
I couldn't save her.

790
01:15:11,754 --> 01:15:13,278
Means this princess
is not a real one.

791
01:15:14,757 --> 01:15:17,282
The real princess died 17 years back.

792
01:15:19,695 --> 01:15:22,095
Yes. If the princess
would have been alive then...

793
01:15:22,164 --> 01:15:25,224
...I swear on the feet of
late majesty, I would have...

794
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:27,269
...risked my life, and see to
it that she got her rights.

795
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:33,709
...and I would have
taken you to the willows.

796
01:15:34,643 --> 01:15:36,110
First I will hang
them on the willows...

797
01:15:36,178 --> 01:15:38,669
...and then I will handle you also.

798
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,250
So, much do you want?
- Ten, ten.

799
01:15:53,329 --> 01:15:54,626
One million rupees.

800
01:15:54,697 --> 01:15:57,257
No. Not one million rupees.
Give us one million beatings.

801
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:59,460
Give half to me and half to him.

802
01:15:59,535 --> 01:16:02,060
Why do you hit me? I
already died seeing his gun shot.

803
01:16:02,137 --> 01:16:07,404
- He is a pillar.

804
01:16:08,477 --> 01:16:10,342
Hello Mr. Pillar. Will
you give me an autograph?

805
01:16:13,682 --> 01:16:15,343
We have not seen anything.
We didn't hear anything.

806
01:16:15,417 --> 01:16:17,351
You are a king. You are majesty.

807
01:16:17,653 --> 01:16:20,247
Kill a rat or a dog
but don't kill us.

808
01:16:20,689 --> 01:16:22,452
Why Dastur?
- Close the door.

809
01:16:29,498 --> 01:16:30,556
Come, sir.

810
01:16:32,701 --> 01:16:34,635
Even we will not
leave you, you cruel.

811
01:16:37,172 --> 01:16:40,335
What's this? Where is the girl?

812
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:45,674
Where millions are involved, I
will not go from there so easily.

813
01:16:46,715 --> 01:16:48,114
Oh! I think you were
dreaming of becoming...

814
01:16:48,183 --> 01:16:51,448
...a princess, that's
why you didn't escape.

815
01:16:52,621 --> 01:16:54,111
But even you know that
this dream of yours...

816
01:16:54,189 --> 01:16:55,713
...has taken you to
the doors of death.

817
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:58,115
One has to play with
life and death...

818
01:16:58,193 --> 01:17:01,720
...to achieve the crown and throne.

819
01:17:02,197 --> 01:17:04,665
Not play with death, but
you will have to hug death.

820
01:17:05,734 --> 01:17:07,065
I will make a
dangerous condition of yours...

821
01:17:07,136 --> 01:17:08,728
...which you might
not have even imagined.

822
01:17:12,207 --> 01:17:14,198
What will you get by harming me?

823
01:17:14,677 --> 01:17:17,077
If you are intelligent then
do something by which both...

824
01:17:17,146 --> 01:17:21,742
...you and me are profited.
And keep this toy inside.

825
01:17:22,651 --> 01:17:27,247
You bloody. - Sir, listen
to something. Listen to me.

826
01:17:27,589 --> 01:17:30,683
What is it?
- An idea has struck me.

827
01:17:31,593 --> 01:17:33,424
We will not get
anything by killing this girl.

828
01:17:34,697 --> 01:17:37,097
Play a game by which the girl is
alive and in our control and...

829
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:40,761
...the property worth
millions comes in our possession.

830
01:17:41,437 --> 01:17:44,099
Have you gone mad?
- Seeing the snap mother...

831
01:17:44,173 --> 01:17:47,233
...princess has accepted
her to be the princess.

832
01:17:48,243 --> 01:17:51,508
If you take any other girl
then no one will believe.

833
01:17:52,715 --> 01:17:54,114
Do a dealing with her and make...

834
01:17:54,183 --> 01:17:55,775
...her sit on the throne of Chandpur.

835
01:17:56,685 --> 01:17:59,279
The throne will then
itself come in our possession.

836
01:18:02,391 --> 01:18:03,449
You donkey, for the
first time in your life...

837
01:18:03,525 --> 01:18:04,583
...you talked of
something which makes sense.

838
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:08,394
Yes sir. You never gave
me an opportunity before.

839
01:18:08,464 --> 01:18:09,556
Shut up.

840
01:18:13,202 --> 01:18:18,731
Girl, continue with the
drama of being a princess.

841
01:18:20,142 --> 01:18:21,507
I will make you sit on
the throne of Chandpur.

842
01:18:22,711 --> 01:18:24,076
And the day you will
be crowned, you will...

843
01:18:24,146 --> 01:18:28,242
...handover the keys of
treasury in my hands.

844
01:18:28,317 --> 01:18:30,080
Leave alone the keys, I will even...

845
01:18:30,152 --> 01:18:31,346
...keep the lock,
but what will I get?

846
01:18:33,655 --> 01:18:35,520
I will give you one
million in return.

847
01:18:36,225 --> 01:18:39,752
Do you accept the deal?
- No. Two millions.

848
01:18:40,696 --> 01:18:45,497
Do you agree?
- I agree.

849
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:12,718
My child.

850
01:19:13,629 --> 01:19:15,062
My child. I was feeling restless to...

851
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:16,461
...hug you since so many years.

852
01:19:18,634 --> 01:19:20,067
Don't know how many
troubles you must...

853
01:19:20,135 --> 01:19:23,229
...have borne in the last 20 years.
- Mother.

854
01:19:31,113 --> 01:19:34,640
Now the game is in our hands.
Lets cheers on this. Cheers.

855
01:19:36,718 --> 01:19:38,083
Sir, these are the two men who...

856
01:19:38,153 --> 01:19:40,747
...vanished the
princess from the hotel.

857
01:19:41,256 --> 01:19:44,692
Are we magicians to make the
girl appear and disappear?

858
01:19:45,427 --> 01:19:46,587
That girl herself was a magician.

859
01:19:46,662 --> 01:19:49,324
She was about to vanish us.
She was a cheater.

860
01:19:50,766 --> 01:19:53,701
Where is the girl? - Where is
the girl? - Where is the girl?

861
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:57,261
It is better to go to the
graveyard than telling this.

862
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,365
Not so early sir. Now he will give.

863
01:20:02,678 --> 01:20:06,774
Sir, the thing is you even
need to put petrol to start a car.

864
01:20:07,316 --> 01:20:10,774
To start us put the petrol of money,
we will ring the horn.

865
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,119
Even that will be
done but first tell...

866
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:15,247
...in which city is
the girl right now?

867
01:20:15,324 --> 01:20:18,725
Maybe Kanpur.
- No. No. Nagpur.

868
01:20:19,261 --> 01:20:22,389
No. No. Jabalpur.
- Cha... Cha... Chandpur.

869
01:20:23,732 --> 01:20:26,394
Chandpur.
- Yes. Yes.

870
01:20:33,642 --> 01:20:41,310
Yes...

871
01:20:42,317 --> 01:20:44,148
If the men of Shamsher Singh see us...

872
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:46,380
...then they will take
us to the graveyard.

873
01:20:49,758 --> 01:20:54,422
Chandpur is a treasure. We
have to walk only 5 miles.

874
01:20:54,596 --> 01:20:57,827
And then we will get one million.

875
01:21:02,437 --> 01:21:04,598
'Why don't we fix the
relation today itself? '

876
01:21:04,673 --> 01:21:07,733
'My daughter and your son.
- I accept. Let's hug each other.'

877
01:21:08,177 --> 01:21:10,702
What happened mother?
- Nothing, my child. Nothing.

878
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:12,442
Tell me, what happened?

879
01:21:13,549 --> 01:21:15,107
Today destiny has returned you your...

880
01:21:15,184 --> 01:21:17,618
...rights to you, and
my daughter to me.

881
01:21:18,687 --> 01:21:21,121
After shedding tears in
your remembrance for...

882
01:21:21,190 --> 01:21:23,715
...years, today lights are
sparkling in this house.

883
01:21:25,194 --> 01:21:27,719
Now it looks like even my
dream will be fulfilled, mother.

884
01:21:28,197 --> 01:21:30,290
Now only one dream is
left unfulfilled, my child.

885
01:21:31,466 --> 01:21:33,297
Your marriage.
- Marriage?

886
01:21:33,635 --> 01:21:35,125
Yes. Your father had
fixed your relation in...

887
01:21:35,204 --> 01:21:38,367
...childhood with Kumar Singh,
the son of mistress.

888
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:40,139
But mother, me...
- I expect my child that...

889
01:21:40,209 --> 01:21:43,372
...you will not reject his last wish.

890
01:21:46,281 --> 01:21:48,374
You?
- Yes, me. - Get lost from here.

891
01:21:48,717 --> 01:21:50,685
Don't worry. I have not
come to blackmail you.

892
01:21:50,752 --> 01:21:52,481
Go and play this
drama somewhere else.

893
01:21:52,821 --> 01:21:54,311
The drama has ended long back.

894
01:21:54,389 --> 01:21:55,651
I have come to start the reality.

895
01:21:56,658 --> 01:21:59,388
Reality? By handing me to
the police like that day.

896
01:21:59,828 --> 01:22:01,625
It was a mistake, a sin,
which I made unknowingly.

897
01:22:05,267 --> 01:22:07,098
That's why I have
come to penance now...

898
01:22:07,169 --> 01:22:09,262
...and I have come to
make you believe my love.

899
01:22:17,613 --> 01:22:21,709
That day the game was in your hand,
today it is in my hand.

900
01:22:22,618 --> 01:22:24,108
On my one shout you will be caught...

901
01:22:24,186 --> 01:22:27,280
...in fetters and put into the prison.

902
01:22:28,423 --> 01:22:30,414
It will be better for
you if you leave from here.

903
01:22:32,294 --> 01:22:34,125
I've heard when money
comes not only the clothes...

904
01:22:34,196 --> 01:22:36,289
...but even the spirit of
a person gets changed...

905
01:22:36,365 --> 01:22:39,459
...and starts flowing. I am leaving.

906
01:22:40,302 --> 01:22:42,736
But before I leave,
listen to something.

907
01:22:43,472 --> 01:22:46,134
If I don't break your
arrogance and take you in front of...

908
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:48,733
...the entire court, then
even my name is not Kishan.

909
01:22:51,647 --> 01:22:52,739
Even I will see.

910
01:22:53,282 --> 01:22:55,750
Glory to the princess.
Glory to the princess.

911
01:22:56,485 --> 01:22:58,817
Glory to the princess.
Glory to the princess.

912
01:23:02,591 --> 01:23:04,081
Today on this auspicious occasion...

913
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:07,492
...I want to give you
all one more good news.

914
01:23:09,698 --> 01:23:12,098
The princess
engagement is fixed with...

915
01:23:12,167 --> 01:23:15,261
...master Virendra Singh's son, Kumar.

916
01:23:26,515 --> 01:23:28,107
I was told in childhood that I will...

917
01:23:28,183 --> 01:23:30,708
...be married to the
princess of Chandpur.

918
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:34,111
But today it feels as
if he moon has come...

919
01:23:34,189 --> 01:23:37,716
...down from the sky on to the earth.

920
01:23:38,627 --> 01:23:44,623
I am very lucky that
destiny has made you mine.

921
01:23:47,202 --> 01:23:49,534
Search someone else for yourself.

922
01:23:50,205 --> 01:23:52,730
Only I have the right on her.

923
01:24:00,749 --> 01:24:04,082
The people in love break the
walls of life and hug death...

924
01:24:04,152 --> 01:24:07,747
...and I just broke the wall of
a fort and desired to see you.

925
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:10,089
You ill mannered. Do you know...

926
01:24:10,158 --> 01:24:11,648
...where you are standing right now?

927
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:15,425
Below the sky and above
the earth made by God.

928
01:24:16,598 --> 01:24:18,088
Then be on earth. If
you look towards...

929
01:24:18,166 --> 01:24:20,691
...the sky then you will be beheaded.

930
01:24:22,704 --> 01:24:26,765
People in love live from heart,
who is bothered of head?

931
01:24:27,709 --> 01:24:29,108
I can give you such a
punishment for this mistake...

932
01:24:29,177 --> 01:24:32,544
...that you will remember
it throughout your life.

933
01:24:33,281 --> 01:24:35,112
I have borne so many
punishments in life...

934
01:24:35,183 --> 01:24:37,708
...that punishments
remember and not vice versa.

935
01:24:38,286 --> 01:24:42,484
I am giving you a last chance.
Leave from here immediately.

936
01:24:42,724 --> 01:24:47,354
I have come to leave, but not alone.
I will take you along.

937
01:24:47,429 --> 01:24:48,794
Arrest him.

938
01:25:20,495 --> 01:25:23,589
A beloved has come.

939
01:25:24,433 --> 01:25:31,703
A beloved has come
keeping his head on his hand.

940
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:35,539
I have given my heart to you.

941
01:25:36,378 --> 01:25:39,506
Now I will even
give my life for you.

942
01:25:40,515 --> 01:25:47,387
My dear, my beloved.
My dear, my beloved.

943
01:25:48,457 --> 01:25:55,522
A beloved has come
keeping his head on his hand.

944
01:25:56,465 --> 01:25:59,798
I have given my heart to you.

945
01:26:00,469 --> 01:26:03,438
Now I will even
give my life for you.

946
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:11,736
My dear, my beloved.
My dear, my beloved.

947
01:26:12,214 --> 01:26:15,206
A beloved has come.

948
01:26:16,151 --> 01:26:18,244
A beloved.

949
01:26:46,715 --> 01:26:50,776
I am not the one to feel scared.

950
01:26:51,186 --> 01:26:54,349
There is no sorrow even if I die.

951
01:26:55,290 --> 01:26:58,384
I am not the one to feel scared.

952
01:26:58,793 --> 01:27:02,320
There is no sorrow even if I die.

953
01:27:03,064 --> 01:27:10,470
Dear, this hatred of
yours is not less than love.

954
01:27:10,572 --> 01:27:20,243
I will call it a flower
even if you throw a stone.

955
01:27:20,682 --> 01:27:23,583
A beloved has come.

956
01:27:24,486 --> 01:27:26,420
A beloved.

957
01:28:22,711 --> 01:28:24,076
The heart is meant for loving...

958
01:28:24,145 --> 01:28:30,243
...and life is meant
for giving to others.

959
01:28:30,685 --> 01:28:32,084
The heart is meant for loving...

960
01:28:32,153 --> 01:28:38,353
...and life is meant
for giving to others.

961
01:28:39,227 --> 01:28:45,757
What is the value of life,
for a person mad in love?

962
01:28:47,268 --> 01:28:56,438
Try it today and see.
See it, my beloved.

963
01:28:56,711 --> 01:28:59,771
A beloved has come.

964
01:29:00,382 --> 01:29:02,213
A beloved.

965
01:29:31,479 --> 01:29:38,510
You are upset with me.
This attitude is very good.

966
01:29:39,587 --> 01:29:46,459
You are upset with me.
This attitude is very good.

967
01:29:47,429 --> 01:29:54,699
How do the people know that
this is a secret of love?

968
01:29:55,437 --> 01:29:58,270
Every one gets upsets
and then they agree.

969
01:29:59,174 --> 01:30:04,703
They agree. They often agree.

970
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:12,479
A beloved has come
keeping his head on his hand.

971
01:30:13,254 --> 01:30:16,587
I have given my heart to you.

972
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:20,617
Now I will even
give my life for you.

973
01:30:21,262 --> 01:30:28,532
My dear, my beloved.
My dear, my beloved.

974
01:30:29,537 --> 01:30:32,506
A beloved has come.

975
01:30:33,508 --> 01:30:35,305
A beloved.

976
01:30:35,376 --> 01:30:36,468
Now you people will dance.

977
01:30:36,544 --> 01:30:38,307
Now you all will dance.
Dance otherwise...

978
01:30:38,546 --> 01:30:40,138
All of you dance.

979
01:30:41,216 --> 01:30:43,207
Other wish...

980
01:30:53,328 --> 01:30:57,492
A beloved has come.

981
01:31:12,514 --> 01:31:14,106
Big mom, move from the way.

982
01:31:14,182 --> 01:31:17,174
You cannot take my daughter-in-law
from here till I am alive.

983
01:31:17,252 --> 01:31:19,447
You will have to pass
through my dead body.

984
01:31:19,521 --> 01:31:22,513
Don't be stubborn, big mom. I
have been fulfilling all your...

985
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:25,855
...orders throughout my life.
Move from my way now.

986
01:31:25,927 --> 01:31:29,294
Today you are taking
the honor of my house.

987
01:31:29,364 --> 01:31:32,128
If you really have the blood
of Rajputs in your veins then...

988
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:35,294
...you are under the oath of
your mother's milk. Let go of her.

989
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:39,135
Today. Today I would have fulfilled...

990
01:31:39,207 --> 01:31:41,300
...my wish by hook or by crook.

991
01:31:41,476 --> 01:31:45,537
But you have put me under
the oath of my mother's milk.

992
01:31:46,481 --> 01:31:49,780
Take.
- Child.

993
01:31:52,054 --> 01:31:55,990
We want to meet the princess.
We want to meet the princess.

994
01:31:56,058 --> 01:31:57,992
We want to meet the princess.
We want to meet the princess

995
01:31:58,494 --> 01:32:01,327
Stop. - Princess. - Tell me,
what's the matter?

996
01:32:03,265 --> 01:32:05,995
Princess, the people
of your kingdom are...

997
01:32:06,068 --> 01:32:07,126
...under oppression
since the last 20 years.

998
01:32:07,203 --> 01:32:10,263
The farmer does hard work
and instead of food eats whips

999
01:32:11,207 --> 01:32:14,142
Some times he
quenches his thirst by...

1000
01:32:14,210 --> 01:32:15,507
...tears and sometimes by his blood.

1001
01:32:20,082 --> 01:32:21,549
How did this rats of
kingdom enter the palace?

1002
01:32:22,084 --> 01:32:24,348
These poor people have
come with some complaints.

1003
01:32:26,288 --> 01:32:28,017
A false princess doesn't
listen to real complaints.

1004
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:29,148
But they want to...

1005
01:32:29,225 --> 01:32:32,160
Tell them to go out from here.
- They want to tell something.

1006
01:32:32,228 --> 01:32:34,162
Ask them to go or
else on my one hint...

1007
01:32:34,230 --> 01:32:36,198
...they will be sent
out of this world.

1008
01:32:37,099 --> 01:32:38,157
Shall I show you an example?

1009
01:32:38,234 --> 01:32:40,031
No. No. Don't do like this, please.

1010
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:49,236
You all leave from here. I
don't want to listen to anything.

1011
01:33:02,057 --> 01:33:05,993
Manohar Singh, these poor
people came with a complaint.

1012
01:33:06,061 --> 01:33:08,996
Listen to their
complaints properly this night.

1013
01:33:28,083 --> 01:33:30,176
I hate you.

1014
01:33:30,619 --> 01:33:37,183
You are upset with me.
This is a nice expression.

1015
01:33:38,694 --> 01:33:45,190
You are upset with me.
This is a nice expression.

1016
01:33:47,102 --> 01:33:54,099
How would the people know
that this is a secret of love?

1017
01:33:55,044 --> 01:33:56,978
Every beautiful girl who is
upset is convinced at last.

1018
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:02,983
Did you recognize me? He
really loves you very much.

1019
01:34:06,055 --> 01:34:07,317
Not me, but he loves my money.

1020
01:34:07,389 --> 01:34:10,586
You desire for money.
Who had come for theft?

1021
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:12,459
Who played with the
emotions of mother queen?

1022
01:34:12,528 --> 01:34:13,995
If he wanted, he would have taken...

1023
01:34:14,063 --> 01:34:15,257
...you in front of the entire court.

1024
01:34:15,331 --> 01:34:19,995
But no. He kept the promise of
mistress and left you there.

1025
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:24,005
Mary, he really loves you.

1026
01:34:48,297 --> 01:34:51,960
Kishan. Kishan, take me from here.

1027
01:34:53,035 --> 01:34:55,560
Take me very far from here.

1028
01:35:13,389 --> 01:35:16,483
You? Princess, since
when the people of palace...

1029
01:35:16,558 --> 01:35:21,495
...started knocking
on the doors of huts?

1030
01:35:23,065 --> 01:35:25,590
Since the time the heart
believed the truth of your love.

1031
01:35:25,667 --> 01:35:30,502
Is it? How did hatred
suddenly turn to love?

1032
01:35:32,074 --> 01:35:36,170
Believe me, Kishan. I
feel choked in that palace.

1033
01:35:37,546 --> 01:35:39,207
A poor man spends his
life even on the bed of...

1034
01:35:39,281 --> 01:35:41,681
...thorns and you are
feeling choked even in a palace.

1035
01:35:43,152 --> 01:35:45,518
Yes, I would have
taken you but not now.

1036
01:35:47,089 --> 01:35:49,353
Do you know, I swore on my mother's...

1037
01:35:49,425 --> 01:35:52,417
...milk and I can't
break that promise.

1038
01:35:53,562 --> 01:35:55,962
You took that oath for the
real princess of this kingdom...

1039
01:35:56,031 --> 01:36:01,469
...who is dead. But me... I
am not the real princess.

1040
01:36:01,537 --> 01:36:03,300
Kishan, I beg falling at your feet...

1041
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:06,434
I have been
imprisoned like a pawn on...

1042
01:36:06,508 --> 01:36:09,306
...which Shamsher Singh
is playing his tricks.

1043
01:36:10,245 --> 01:36:12,975
Take me from here.
Kishan, take me from here.

1044
01:36:14,049 --> 01:36:15,175
Take me somewhere far from here.

1045
01:36:20,055 --> 01:36:21,989
Mother, you are here.

1046
01:36:24,059 --> 01:36:26,186
Mother, do you know her?

1047
01:36:32,501 --> 01:36:34,469
What are you seeing, loot the
houses of those people who...

1048
01:36:34,536 --> 01:36:37,266
...have not paid the revenue,
and put them in dungeon.

1049
01:36:38,073 --> 01:36:40,166
Search the princess
by hook or by crook.

1050
01:36:59,127 --> 01:37:01,220
Don't be so cruel. Be scared of God.

1051
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:04,965
You don't leave a
single grain for the poor...

1052
01:37:05,033 --> 01:37:06,967
...and upon that you
even ask for revenue.

1053
01:37:07,035 --> 01:37:09,970
This is not revenue but the
pieces of flesh from the body.

1054
01:37:10,038 --> 01:37:12,563
Pinch and eat it.
- Let go, you cruel men.

1055
01:37:12,641 --> 01:37:14,506
Let go of my father.
Let go of my father.

1056
01:37:15,644 --> 01:37:17,134
Why do you oppress the poor ones?

1057
01:37:19,381 --> 01:37:22,475
Shut up, you girl.
Shamsher Singh rules here.

1058
01:37:23,051 --> 01:37:26,578
And those who doesn't
obey his orders, are killed.

1059
01:37:28,056 --> 01:37:30,115
If we curse you, then
neither you will remain...

1060
01:37:30,192 --> 01:37:32,160
...nor Shamsher Singh,
and neither his rule.

1061
01:37:34,062 --> 01:37:36,121
Let go of me, you scoundrel.

1062
01:37:36,198 --> 01:37:37,256
You have insulted
Shamsher Singh. Today I will...

1063
01:37:37,332 --> 01:37:38,993
...take out your honor in
front of the whole village.

1064
01:37:41,403 --> 01:37:42,995
Let go of me, you cruel.
Let go of me.

1065
01:37:44,072 --> 01:37:46,006
Be afraid of the judgment of god.

1066
01:37:46,542 --> 01:37:49,204
You shameless. Does
your rule teach you...

1067
01:37:49,278 --> 01:37:50,336
...to snatch the honor of a woman?

1068
01:37:50,412 --> 01:37:54,109
I say let go of me. Let go
of me. What are you seeing?

1069
01:37:55,017 --> 01:37:57,349
He is not snatching my honor,
but of your mother, sister...

1070
01:37:57,419 --> 01:38:01,446
...and your daughter.
Have some shame at least.

1071
01:38:02,024 --> 01:38:05,960
Let go of me, you scoundrel.
May god teach you a lesson.

1072
01:38:06,028 --> 01:38:09,225
Help me. Help me.

1073
01:38:13,035 --> 01:38:14,468
From where did you come?

1074
01:38:17,372 --> 01:38:19,567
You cruel men, whenever
there is a threat to the...

1075
01:38:19,641 --> 01:38:20,972
...honor of Draupadi, a
Kishan took birth on this earth.

1076
01:38:21,043 --> 01:38:22,101
You bitch.

1077
01:38:22,177 --> 01:38:25,510
Wait. Enough of this oppression.
Stop this cruelty.

1078
01:38:25,581 --> 01:38:27,515
Only the orders of
Shamsher Singh are fulfilled here.

1079
01:38:28,050 --> 01:38:29,984
Let Shamsher go to hell.

1080
01:39:12,027 --> 01:39:14,222
What are you seeing? Put
the entire village on fire.

1081
01:40:18,226 --> 01:40:20,956
Bastard. You are a beggar of
streets worth two pennies.

1082
01:40:21,029 --> 01:40:22,553
How dare you create
obstacles in my work?

1083
01:40:23,031 --> 01:40:25,966
They were doing so much oppression...

1084
01:40:26,034 --> 01:40:27,092
...that I was unable to bear it.

1085
01:40:29,037 --> 01:40:31,972
I have ruled this kingdom on
the foundation of cruelty.

1086
01:40:33,241 --> 01:40:35,971
I used blood instead of
ink on the paper of justice.

1087
01:40:37,045 --> 01:40:39,309
This is my law. - Keep me
away from this environment.

1088
01:40:40,048 --> 01:40:41,982
I can't see the
condition of poor people.

1089
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:43,483
I can't bear their screams.

1090
01:40:47,589 --> 01:40:48,988
Bear it till tomorrow.
Then you will...

1091
01:40:49,057 --> 01:40:51,048
...not hear these screams.
- Means?

1092
01:40:52,994 --> 01:40:58,057
Come with me. Tomorrow
is your crowing ceremony.

1093
01:40:58,133 --> 01:40:59,464
Crowning ceremony?
- Yes.

1094
01:41:01,002 --> 01:41:02,060
The government has
accepted you as the...

1095
01:41:02,137 --> 01:41:03,195
...princess on the
saying of her excellency.

1096
01:41:05,006 --> 01:41:06,337
And see. See this.
- What is this?

1097
01:41:08,343 --> 01:41:10,402
This is the key to
that treasure which I...

1098
01:41:10,479 --> 01:41:11,946
...had been worshipping
since the last 20 years.

1099
01:41:13,448 --> 01:41:15,279
I have prayed for this
treasure like fools.

1100
01:41:16,017 --> 01:41:18,952
But I was never able
to reach this treasure...

1101
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:20,078
...because the
government has given the keys...

1102
01:41:20,155 --> 01:41:21,349
...of this treasure in
the hands of trustees.

1103
01:41:21,423 --> 01:41:22,947
Tomorrow after your
crowing ceremony...

1104
01:41:23,024 --> 01:41:24,958
...the keys will come into your hands.

1105
01:41:25,026 --> 01:41:27,153
You handover all those keys to me.

1106
01:41:28,230 --> 01:41:30,425
Then. Then this
treasure will be mine.

1107
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:33,968
The desire of Shamsher
Singh's life will be fulfilled.

1108
01:41:34,035 --> 01:41:35,969
His penance will be completed.

1109
01:41:36,037 --> 01:41:37,095
This kingdom will become his and...

1110
01:41:37,172 --> 01:41:38,366
...her excellency
will become his slave.

1111
01:41:40,041 --> 01:41:41,133
Hey! What happened?

1112
01:41:44,045 --> 01:41:48,505
I am feeling little bit scared.
My feet are staggering.

1113
01:41:50,051 --> 01:41:52,315
I will not be able to do this work.
- What?

1114
01:41:54,055 --> 01:41:55,113
Tomorrow is the
crowning ceremony and...

1115
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:56,248
...you are saying you
can't do this work.

1116
01:41:56,458 --> 01:41:57,982
You will have to do this work.

1117
01:41:59,261 --> 01:42:00,990
You will have to do
exactly the way I said.

1118
01:42:02,597 --> 01:42:04,394
Remember one thing properly.
If you try to play any...

1119
01:42:04,466 --> 01:42:06,991
...trick tomorrow on the
day of crowning ceremony...

1120
01:42:07,068 --> 01:42:09,502
...or If you provoke
people against me then...

1121
01:42:09,571 --> 01:42:12,404
...my men will bruise you
with bullets right there.

1122
01:42:14,075 --> 01:42:16,600
Did you understand? Go.
Wipe you sweat and take rest.

1123
01:42:18,613 --> 01:42:20,012
Looks like the girl is hesitating.

1124
01:42:21,416 --> 01:42:22,508
Be ready tomorrow. If
she commits any mistake...

1125
01:42:22,584 --> 01:42:25,018
...in the crowing ceremony tomorrow,
then I will take...

1126
01:42:25,086 --> 01:42:28,544
...out a handkerchief from
here as a hint and as soon...

1127
01:42:28,623 --> 01:42:31,023
...as I turn the handkerchief,
you should kill her.

1128
01:42:32,427 --> 01:42:34,156
The crowing ceremony
will definitely take place.

1129
01:42:34,229 --> 01:42:36,026
Do you know what
Shamsher Singh desires?

1130
01:42:37,299 --> 01:42:39,233
I know it very well.
But even my name is not...

1131
01:42:39,301 --> 01:42:42,429
...Kishan if I flop
Shamsher Singh's plans tomorrow.

1132
01:42:48,109 --> 01:42:50,168
The residents of Chandpur,
this day will be...

1133
01:42:50,245 --> 01:42:53,305
...written in golden words in
the history of this kingdom.

1134
01:42:54,583 --> 01:42:56,244
Today that happy day
has come for which...

1135
01:42:56,318 --> 01:42:57,979
...we had been waiting
for the last 20 years.

1136
01:42:59,254 --> 01:43:01,188
This kingdom existed
but there was no...

1137
01:43:01,256 --> 01:43:03,190
...one to sit on the
throne and do justice.

1138
01:43:04,492 --> 01:43:07,188
That person to do justice
has come. Princess Ratna.

1139
01:43:18,139 --> 01:43:20,004
And now she will be crowned.

1140
01:43:31,620 --> 01:43:33,520
Princess, here are the
keys to the treasury.

1141
01:43:35,357 --> 01:43:38,019
From today this is your
responsibility. Congratulations.

1142
01:43:46,101 --> 01:43:49,036
If the keys is so big, then
how heavy must be the treasure?

1143
01:43:49,104 --> 01:43:50,628
Don't worry about that, princess.

1144
01:43:51,039 --> 01:43:53,507
The servant is present
to bear that weight.

1145
01:43:55,043 --> 01:43:57,978
I've heard that the revenue
of many people is still due.

1146
01:43:59,047 --> 01:44:02,380
Yes, princess. The tax of many
years is due on these people.

1147
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:04,975
They take the whippings but
don't pay the land revenue.

1148
01:44:05,053 --> 01:44:06,987
Let everyone's revenue be pardoned.

1149
01:44:07,055 --> 01:44:10,991
What? - Yes. Let
everyone's old revenue be pardoned...

1150
01:44:11,059 --> 01:44:14,495
...and in future don't take
the revenue from anyone.

1151
01:44:18,066 --> 01:44:21,502
What are you seeing,
minister? Announce it.

1152
01:44:23,271 --> 01:44:28,402
The princess in her
full senses announces...

1153
01:44:28,476 --> 01:44:31,536
...that everyone's land
revenue is pardoned.

1154
01:44:33,081 --> 01:44:35,015
And from today onwards no revenue...

1155
01:44:35,083 --> 01:44:36,345
...will be taken from anyone.

1156
01:44:37,686 --> 01:44:42,020
And the lands that are
confiscated be released.

1157
01:44:43,692 --> 01:44:45,421
And the lands that
have been confiscated...

1158
01:44:45,493 --> 01:44:48,018
...will be returned to them.

1159
01:44:49,431 --> 01:44:50,489
What am I listening?

1160
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:54,962
What is the punishment
given in this kingdom to...

1161
01:44:55,036 --> 01:44:57,231
...those who take undue
advantage of their position?

1162
01:44:57,305 --> 01:45:00,570
They are whipped and
locked in the prison.

1163
01:45:01,042 --> 01:45:04,478
Then take them. Whip them
and close them in prison.

1164
01:45:04,546 --> 01:45:08,107
But they are...
- They are cruel.

1165
01:45:08,183 --> 01:45:10,310
They have oppressed the poor people.

1166
01:45:11,586 --> 01:45:13,451
Ram Singh.
- Order, sir. Take this two men...

1167
01:45:13,521 --> 01:45:15,580
...and whipping them
close them in prison.

1168
01:45:17,058 --> 01:45:20,391
Forgive us, master.
Forgive us, master.

1169
01:45:20,462 --> 01:45:21,986
This is the order of the princess.

1170
01:45:23,064 --> 01:45:24,122
Forgive us. Forgive us.

1171
01:45:27,602 --> 01:45:31,003
Wait. The prisons are already full.

1172
01:45:32,073 --> 01:45:33,335
There might not be
any place for them.

1173
01:45:34,075 --> 01:45:36,600
Release the old prisoners.

1174
01:45:37,078 --> 01:45:39,012
Thanks a lot to the princess.

1175
01:45:40,081 --> 01:45:42,413
Glory to the princess.
Glory to the princess.

1176
01:45:42,484 --> 01:45:45,351
Father. - My child. God
listened to my prayers.

1177
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:47,513
Yes, father. - The princess
has really done a miracle.

1178
01:45:52,027 --> 01:46:01,959
Dear, handover the gun to
me and hold what I give you.

1179
01:46:04,305 --> 01:46:07,365
This is an artificial one.
- Even you are not real.

1180
01:46:10,045 --> 01:46:12,377
Take it. Take it.

1181
01:46:17,052 --> 01:46:19,145
Now one last thing is remaining.

1182
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:20,983
It will be better if
I complete that too.

1183
01:46:22,323 --> 01:46:25,986
Minister, since how long
are you serving this kingdom?

1184
01:46:26,061 --> 01:46:28,120
I served this kingdom my entire life.

1185
01:46:28,196 --> 01:46:30,596
Then do something. Take rest now.

1186
01:46:30,665 --> 01:46:34,260
It is not good for health
to work so much in old age.

1187
01:46:34,335 --> 01:46:36,997
Shamsher Singh's
bones are made of steel

1188
01:46:37,072 --> 01:46:38,539
He can never become old.

1189
01:46:40,075 --> 01:46:43,010
By keeping for longer periods
even real steel turns rusty.

1190
01:46:43,078 --> 01:46:45,603
Don't trust too much on your bones.

1191
01:46:47,082 --> 01:46:50,017
If they break, you will
not even be able to walk.

1192
01:46:55,557 --> 01:46:57,457
He is showing the flag when
the train has already moved.

1193
01:47:00,628 --> 01:47:03,461
Look, now you don't even
seem to be feeling well.

1194
01:47:04,032 --> 01:47:06,227
Why are sweating in
this winter season?

1195
01:47:07,168 --> 01:47:09,966
He is just sweating, and don't
know what all he is emitting.

1196
01:47:10,572 --> 01:47:14,372
Go and take rest. From
today you are on holiday.

1197
01:47:15,043 --> 01:47:18,376
He has been fired. Now
what will happen to you?

1198
01:47:18,446 --> 01:47:21,472
Glory to the princess.
Glory to the princess.

1199
01:47:21,549 --> 01:47:22,982
Glory to the princess.

1200
01:47:23,585 --> 01:47:26,383
Wait minister. Take your flag.

1201
01:47:27,388 --> 01:47:29,253
You old one, what are you seeing?
Take your flag and go.

1202
01:47:29,324 --> 01:47:31,189
You may require it
to wipe your sweat...

1203
01:47:31,259 --> 01:47:33,489
...and in future to wipe what not.

1204
01:47:33,561 --> 01:47:34,994
Take it. Take it. You see that side.

1205
01:47:42,604 --> 01:47:44,504
Trustee sir.
- Yes, princess.

1206
01:47:46,074 --> 01:47:49,009
I am not capable of
handling this burden.

1207
01:47:50,078 --> 01:47:51,545
I handover this
responsibility to you.

1208
01:47:53,014 --> 01:47:54,948
But princess?
- Yes. - As per your order.

1209
01:47:55,016 --> 01:47:58,952
Glory to the princess.
Glory to the princess.

1210
01:48:03,158 --> 01:48:06,559
Mother queen, I am not a princess.
I am a thief.

1211
01:48:08,029 --> 01:48:11,362
I pretended to be your
daughter in greed of money.

1212
01:48:12,033 --> 01:48:15,093
I had come to deceive
you and loot your money.

1213
01:48:16,471 --> 01:48:21,431
But your love and
affection put shackles in my feet.

1214
01:48:23,044 --> 01:48:25,979
Today I am going very
far from you, mother.

1215
01:48:27,048 --> 01:48:29,983
If possible. If possible, forgive me.

1216
01:48:56,010 --> 01:48:58,137
You? What have you come to do here?

1217
01:49:00,548 --> 01:49:02,209
I came to ask about the
health of my princess.

1218
01:49:03,017 --> 01:49:05,076
To ask whether her health has
also deteriorated like her...

1219
01:49:05,153 --> 01:49:07,553
...intentions after handling the
responsibility of the kingdom.

1220
01:49:15,029 --> 01:49:16,087
This is not a wallet from someone's...

1221
01:49:16,164 --> 01:49:17,222
...pocket but, a
hammer of this kingdom.

1222
01:49:17,298 --> 01:49:19,232
Its very heavy and
you will get a sprain...

1223
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:21,097
...in your wrist if
you try to hit with it.

1224
01:49:21,636 --> 01:49:23,126
You ill mannered. Let go of my hand.

1225
01:49:26,307 --> 01:49:27,968
You have not
recognized Shamsher till now.

1226
01:49:29,043 --> 01:49:31,102
He has removed many
big kings and emperors...

1227
01:49:31,179 --> 01:49:32,237
...from his way, and
you a girl of yesterday...

1228
01:49:32,313 --> 01:49:34,474
...has come to remove me from the way.

1229
01:49:45,593 --> 01:49:47,993
I risked my life for this kingdom.

1230
01:49:48,596 --> 01:49:50,496
I will give up my life
but not this kingdom.

1231
01:50:17,992 --> 01:50:19,289
Don't let her go. Catch hold of her.

1232
01:50:22,297 --> 01:50:23,958
Who is it?
- It's me.

1233
01:50:28,036 --> 01:50:30,095
Where will you escape?
- I am your master.

1234
01:50:43,051 --> 01:50:46,509
Shamsher Singh, I have finished...

1235
01:50:46,587 --> 01:50:47,986
...your swine's, now it is your turn.

1236
01:50:49,057 --> 01:50:51,389
You bastard. Why you
do hide and attack?

1237
01:50:51,459 --> 01:50:52,926
If you have the
courage come in front.

1238
01:51:33,034 --> 01:51:34,092
You bastard.

1239
01:51:55,056 --> 01:51:56,114
The marks of your
whips are present on...

1240
01:51:56,190 --> 01:51:58,590
...the back of every
man of this kingdom.

1241
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:02,325
I will make you pay for
that each and every whip.

1242
01:52:04,065 --> 01:52:05,123
Since the past 20 years these poor...

1243
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:06,325
...people have been bearing this pain.

1244
01:52:06,401 --> 01:52:08,164
Today you also
experience that pain and see.

1245
01:52:09,070 --> 01:52:10,128
Get up, you scoundrel.

1246
01:52:16,077 --> 01:52:23,006
Move. Don't try to play tricks.
Move straight. Move.

1247
01:52:26,521 --> 01:52:28,182
What happened, daughter?
- Nothing.

1248
01:52:29,424 --> 01:52:31,187
Since the past 20
years Shamsher Singh had...

1249
01:52:31,259 --> 01:52:34,160
...forgotten his position. I
was reminding him the same.

1250
01:52:35,096 --> 01:52:36,529
Take him and put him in dungeon.

1251
01:52:36,597 --> 01:52:41,034
No. No, princess. No. No.
Have mercy. Have mercy. Mercy.

1252
01:52:42,103 --> 01:52:43,570
He is an old and faithful servant.

1253
01:52:44,105 --> 01:52:46,039
If today he has
committed any mistake then...

1254
01:52:46,107 --> 01:52:47,506
...I ask you for
forgiveness on his behalf.

1255
01:52:48,109 --> 01:52:50,043
Forgive him once and never again in...

1256
01:52:50,111 --> 01:52:51,305
...his life will he
protest against you.

1257
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:55,972
And if he protests again,
then behead him.

1258
01:52:57,452 --> 01:53:00,250
Shamsher Singh's flower.

1259
01:53:03,324 --> 01:53:05,121
You are very fond of flowers.
Isn't it?

1260
01:53:06,327 --> 01:53:08,192
The gardens over
here are getting dried.

1261
01:53:09,063 --> 01:53:11,998
From tomorrow you will work
as a gardener. Understood?

1262
01:53:12,066 --> 01:53:14,125
The flowers have
bloomed in every garden.

1263
01:53:18,339 --> 01:53:20,170
Father. Father, you?
- Yes.

1264
01:53:21,509 --> 01:53:22,999
How come you are here?
- You only called me here.

1265
01:53:23,077 --> 01:53:26,012
Me?
- Yes. Yes. - No, I didn't.

1266
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:28,014
Father, leave immediately from here...

1267
01:53:28,082 --> 01:53:29,140
...or else the entire
game will be finished.

1268
01:53:32,086 --> 01:53:35,613
Very well. Very well. So,
you came here to play a game.

1269
01:53:38,359 --> 01:53:39,417
You wanted to take the
entire treasure of this...

1270
01:53:39,494 --> 01:53:41,018
...kingdom and escape
with your lame father.

1271
01:53:45,099 --> 01:53:51,561
Are you a thief? - I was a
thief and I came to commit theft.

1272
01:53:52,039 --> 01:53:55,475
But your love and the
condition of the poor...

1273
01:53:55,543 --> 01:53:56,976
...people here changed my intentions.

1274
01:53:57,044 --> 01:53:58,102
I swear on you, mother queen.

1275
01:53:59,046 --> 01:54:01,514
Don't call me mother.
You are a deceiver.

1276
01:54:02,049 --> 01:54:04,984
You made fun of my
motherly affection.

1277
01:54:05,052 --> 01:54:08,112
You have deceived the honor
and respect of this kingdom.

1278
01:54:08,189 --> 01:54:10,453
Don't say like this, mother.
- Take her away from my eyes.

1279
01:54:11,392 --> 01:54:12,484
We will take her, your highness.

1280
01:54:15,062 --> 01:54:16,461
We will take her in
front of the entire public.

1281
01:54:17,665 --> 01:54:18,996
We will make such condition of her...

1282
01:54:19,066 --> 01:54:20,328
...that even death will shiver once.

1283
01:54:24,472 --> 01:54:26,997
Have mercy, your highness.
Have mercy on my daughter.

1284
01:54:27,074 --> 01:54:28,268
She is the support of my life.

1285
01:54:28,342 --> 01:54:30,003
Your Excellency, have
mercy on my daughter.

1286
01:54:30,077 --> 01:54:32,136
No. She has hurt the
feelings of a mother.

1287
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:34,342
She has made fun of the
throne of this kingdom.

1288
01:54:34,415 --> 01:54:36,474
She should definitely get
the punishment for this.

1289
01:54:36,551 --> 01:54:38,485
No, your highness. She
is innocent and ignorant.

1290
01:54:38,553 --> 01:54:40,418
Forgive her. Please forgive her.

1291
01:54:58,372 --> 01:55:02,365
Where did you find this locket?
Why don't you speak?

1292
01:55:03,044 --> 01:55:04,511
Where did you find
this locket? Speak up.

1293
01:55:04,579 --> 01:55:05,978
Why don't you speak?

1294
01:55:06,047 --> 01:55:11,314
This locket is of my daughter.
- This is a lie.

1295
01:55:12,253 --> 01:55:14,187
This is the same locket
which the king put in...

1296
01:55:14,255 --> 01:55:17,190
...the neck of the princess
after threading it with pearls.

1297
01:55:18,526 --> 01:55:20,994
Tell us truly otherwise the
result of it will be very bad.

1298
01:55:21,062 --> 01:55:24,122
Tell. Tell.
- I will tell. I will tell.

1299
01:55:25,399 --> 01:55:28,129
Your highness, she
is not my daughter.

1300
01:55:29,070 --> 01:55:32,267
20 years back I found her
near the banks of a river.

1301
01:55:33,608 --> 01:55:36,008
And she was having
this locket in her neck.

1302
01:55:36,077 --> 01:55:38,011
Let go of the princess.
Let go of the princess.

1303
01:55:38,079 --> 01:55:41,515
Shut up. If anybody
moves from his place...

1304
01:55:41,582 --> 01:55:45,348
...and if anyone utters
a word from his mouth...

1305
01:55:45,419 --> 01:55:48,513
...then he will be burnt
alive with his entire family.

1306
01:55:50,625 --> 01:55:52,957
How many families
will your burn and...

1307
01:55:53,027 --> 01:55:54,289
...how many mouths will you shut?

1308
01:55:54,362 --> 01:55:58,230
We both are present here. We
will see the drama together.

1309
01:55:59,033 --> 01:56:02,093
Arrest him.
- I am coming.

1310
01:56:14,248 --> 01:56:15,306
Catch hold of him.

1311
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:20,378
Follow him.

1312
01:56:28,596 --> 01:56:29,654
Finish that rascal.

1313
01:58:26,313 --> 01:58:27,974
What are you seeing?
Catch hold of him.

1314
01:58:28,048 --> 01:58:30,243
Kishan.
- Wait. Stop.

1315
01:58:32,586 --> 01:58:35,316
She is the real princess
of Chandpur. Let go of her.

1316
01:58:36,056 --> 01:58:37,318
Real princess?

1317
01:58:40,127 --> 01:58:43,119
Now tell. What price
will you take to go...

1318
01:58:43,197 --> 01:58:47,156
...away from the life of princess?

1319
01:58:50,604 --> 01:58:51,593
Take this, the keys to the treasury.

1320
01:58:52,006 --> 01:58:54,941
Open the treasury and take
as much money as you want.

1321
01:58:55,009 --> 01:58:58,274
But please stop
following the princess. Go.

1322
01:59:02,483 --> 01:59:06,351
Your highness,
people leave palaces in...

1323
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:08,354
...love and reject
the throne and crown.

1324
01:59:09,089 --> 01:59:12,547
People sacrifice in love
and not do dealing in love.

1325
01:59:14,028 --> 01:59:18,089
Be happy. Keep your
treasure with you.

1326
01:59:18,165 --> 01:59:20,360
Now the princess will
get engaged to Kumar.

1327
02:00:11,619 --> 02:00:15,953
Sing, dance and make merry.
Have fun together.

1328
02:00:16,023 --> 02:00:20,960
Sing, dance and make merry.
Have fun together.

1329
02:00:21,028 --> 02:00:25,965
Today is a day of happiness.
So celebrate this happiness.

1330
02:01:12,479 --> 02:01:22,946
Let me go, my friends. What
relation do I have with you?

1331
02:01:24,625 --> 02:01:34,967
Let me go, my friends. What
relation do I have with you?

1332
02:01:37,037 --> 02:01:46,969
I don't have any destination.
I am a vagabond.

1333
02:01:49,049 --> 02:01:58,447
Let me go, my friends. What
relation do I have with you?

1334
02:02:00,527 --> 02:02:09,595
One falls in love with
destiny in this world.

1335
02:02:11,672 --> 02:02:22,412
Or the poor like me falling
in love with rich like you.

1336
02:02:24,084 --> 02:02:34,016
This world is like a moon
and I am a broken star.

1337
02:02:35,629 --> 02:02:46,028
Let me go, my friends. What
relation do I have with you?

1338
02:03:30,617 --> 02:03:36,351
Oh my friend, may
you always be happy.

1339
02:03:37,091 --> 02:03:41,221
Oh my friend, may
you be always happy...

1340
02:03:41,295 --> 02:03:47,530
...in this palace and
in this colorful life.

1341
02:03:49,103 --> 02:03:58,978
Those lanes of me
are calling me back.

1342
02:04:01,048 --> 02:04:11,117
I am a foreigner. I am a nomad.

1343
02:04:13,193 --> 02:04:23,330
Let me go, my friends. What
relation do I have with you?

1344
02:04:25,172 --> 02:04:35,138
I don't have any destination.
I am a vagabond.

1345
02:05:07,581 --> 02:05:09,481
'I have to go.
- Stranger, don't leave me and go.'

1346
02:05:09,550 --> 02:05:12,178
'I'll have to go.
- Stranger, don't leave me and go.'

1347
02:05:13,053 --> 02:05:14,987
'Stranger, don't leave and go. Stop.'

1348
02:05:20,594 --> 02:05:29,127
Foreigner, oh foreigner,
oh foreigner, oh foreigner.

1349
02:05:30,604 --> 02:05:39,535
I have come leaving
those palaces of separation.

1350
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:55,087
I have come breaking all
the traditions of this world.

1351
02:05:56,563 --> 02:06:05,961
You are a sea of love
and I am it's flow.

1352
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:15,971
You are my support
and I am your support.

1353
02:06:18,252 --> 02:06:27,126
You are my support
and I am your support.

1354
02:06:41,074 --> 02:06:42,507
Arrest them.

1355
02:06:48,081 --> 02:06:53,451
Mother queen, fetter
me and bury me alive.

1356
02:06:54,021 --> 02:06:55,488
I accept all punishment of yours.

1357
02:06:57,024 --> 02:07:03,486
But mother, don't
punish my Kishan, my love.

1358
02:07:04,564 --> 02:07:09,501
Release him. I beg
for my love, mother.

1359
02:07:10,037 --> 02:07:14,974
Shut up. Staying in the huts
he had an eye on the palace.

1360
02:07:15,042 --> 02:07:17,169
His eyes will be snatched.
- No, mother.

1361
02:07:17,244 --> 02:07:20,975
So that no one dares
to see here again.

1362
02:07:21,048 --> 02:07:23,448
Don't do like this mother.
- Soldiers, take her.

1363
02:07:25,519 --> 02:07:29,387
Mother queen, I beg in
front of you. Let go of him.

1364
02:07:29,456 --> 02:07:33,984
It is not his fault. Let
go of him, mother queen.

1365
02:07:35,395 --> 02:07:41,197
These are the eyes, which
put a wrong eye on my fiancee?

1366
02:07:41,601 --> 02:07:43,000
Tell.

1367
02:07:55,615 --> 02:07:59,142
You bastard. Till today
you kept biting my affection.

1368
02:08:00,287 --> 02:08:02,278
Today I will kill
you with my own hands.

1369
02:08:24,177 --> 02:08:34,576
No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
No. No. No. No. No.

1370
02:08:36,056 --> 02:08:38,581
Shanti, your voice.

1371
02:08:41,395 --> 02:08:42,987
If today I wouldn't have
been able to speak then a...

1372
02:08:43,063 --> 02:08:46,328
...mother would have ruined
her womb with her own hands.

1373
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:49,130
Kishan is your son,
mistress. He is your son.

1374
02:08:49,202 --> 02:08:50,999
He is your son.

1375
02:08:52,606 --> 02:08:54,938
Don't tell such a big lie
to save your son's life,

1376
02:08:55,008 --> 02:08:56,270
Shanti. Don't.

1377
02:08:56,610 --> 02:08:58,942
No. No, mistress. I am
absolutely speaking the truth.

1378
02:08:59,012 --> 02:09:01,207
Since the past 20 years you used...

1379
02:09:01,281 --> 02:09:04,273
...to ask me what I wanted to tell.

1380
02:09:04,351 --> 02:09:07,149
I just wanted to tell you that
Kishan is your son, not mine.

1381
02:09:07,220 --> 02:09:10,951
No, mom. No, mom. Don't say
like this. Don't say like this.

1382
02:09:12,459 --> 02:09:13,949
I was dying my whole life to hear...

1383
02:09:14,027 --> 02:09:15,460
...the word son from your mouth.

1384
02:09:16,029 --> 02:09:17,963
Today you got back your voice and...

1385
02:09:18,031 --> 02:09:20,090
...you say that I am not your son.

1386
02:09:20,167 --> 02:09:23,102
Don't say like this,
mom. Don't say like this.

1387
02:09:23,570 --> 02:09:25,970
Let my body be cut into pieces.
But don't say like this.

1388
02:09:26,039 --> 02:09:27,973
Don't break the pure relationship...

1389
02:09:28,041 --> 02:09:29,474
...of a mother and his son.

1390
02:09:30,043 --> 02:09:32,102
For God sake you
told this today but...

1391
02:09:32,179 --> 02:09:34,113
...never tell again
that I am not your son.

1392
02:09:38,051 --> 02:09:42,112
No, son. No. I always
considered you as my son.

1393
02:09:43,256 --> 02:09:48,990
That son whom I didn't give
birth but I achieved everything.

1394
02:09:50,997 --> 02:09:54,933
And the one I gave birth
to has no value of me.

1395
02:09:59,005 --> 02:10:02,133
Oh my God! Don't you feel ashamed?

1396
02:10:03,009 --> 02:10:05,944
You are lying to the
mistress to save your son's life.

1397
02:10:06,546 --> 02:10:08,104
Whom we served through out our life.

1398
02:10:08,181 --> 02:10:10,945
No, mistress. I am
speaking the truth.

1399
02:10:11,017 --> 02:10:13,349
You are lying. Tell,
what is the truth...

1400
02:10:13,420 --> 02:10:14,478
Tell them the truth. Tell

1401
02:10:16,356 --> 02:10:20,486
You have got back your life
but I will take your life.

1402
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:24,963
Don't hit my mother.
- Tell. Tell. - No.

1403
02:10:27,033 --> 02:10:28,091
Tell. I say tell.

1404
02:10:45,118 --> 02:10:48,576
Now tell who exchanged the kids?
- Me.

1405
02:10:49,489 --> 02:10:53,323
No. Kumar cannot be
the son of a servant.

1406
02:10:56,396 --> 02:10:59,263
Trustee, bring the keys.
- I don't have the keys.

1407
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,058
I say give me the keys.

1408
02:11:07,274 --> 02:11:09,936
Come.
- Stop. You will not go from here.

1409
02:11:10,010 --> 02:11:11,272
Move or else I will fire.

1410
02:11:12,012 --> 02:11:14,537
I have been living like
kings and I will live like kings.

1411
02:11:15,015 --> 02:11:16,277
Fire on your mother.

1412
02:11:22,222 --> 02:11:28,957
Son, why did you save me?
Why did you save me?

1413
02:11:29,029 --> 02:11:33,090
You should have let me die.
You should have let me die.

1414
02:12:12,539 --> 02:12:13,597
Yes, this one.

1415
02:12:16,076 --> 02:12:17,543
Tell me where is the treasure?

1416
02:12:27,087 --> 02:12:28,145
I don't know.

1417
02:12:30,090 --> 02:12:33,423
I will tell you where is
the treasure. - Who are you?

1418
02:12:33,493 --> 02:12:37,020
I am the person by
whom you will be killed.

1419
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:51,043
If you want your lovers
life then come out. Come.

1420
02:12:55,582 --> 02:12:59,109
Now tell, whose death is
written by whose hands?

1421
02:13:00,587 --> 02:13:03,055
Time will only tell who
will die by whose hands.

1422
02:13:12,532 --> 02:13:15,000
What happened? You have lost courage.

1423
02:13:16,670 --> 02:13:20,003
Now take God's name and
be ready for the prayers.

1424
02:13:42,362 --> 02:13:44,523
If I want I can kill you today.

1425
02:13:46,099 --> 02:13:47,157
But you are the son of that mother...

1426
02:13:47,233 --> 02:13:49,030
...whom I worshipped
through out my life.

1427
02:14:21,067 --> 02:14:23,126
There is definitely
some secret behind it.

1428
02:15:27,066 --> 02:15:28,124
Your death.

1429
02:15:36,509 --> 02:15:39,000
I served this kingdom
for the last 30 years.

1430
02:15:39,078 --> 02:15:41,603
And today you have come
to loot this treasure.

1431
02:15:45,418 --> 02:15:49,479
This is mine. This is mine.
All this is mine.

1432
02:15:51,024 --> 02:15:53,288
This is mine. No one
can snatch it from me.

1433
02:16:00,233 --> 02:16:07,571
No. No. Save. Save. No. No. Save.

1434
02:16:18,651 --> 02:16:20,585
I will give up my life but not you.

1435
02:16:32,665 --> 02:16:36,328
We both are equal.

1436
02:16:36,402 --> 02:16:40,133
We both are equal.
Neither more nor less.

1437
02:16:42,075 --> 02:16:44,134
Promise of love.
- Fifty-fifty. - Fifty-fifty.

1438
02:16:46,179 --> 02:16:48,613
What is the intention?
- Fifty-fifty. - Fifty-fifty.
