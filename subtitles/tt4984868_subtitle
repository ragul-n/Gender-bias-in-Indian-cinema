1
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:54,375
Friendship, enmity and love...

2
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,207
give birth to many stories.

3
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,415
But revenge ends all stories.

4
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:15,082
"I ride my Ducati
at the speed of 150."

5
00:01:16,832 --> 00:01:20,125
"They try very hard.
Everyone talks about me."

6
00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:23,207
"I live in a foreign country.
I have my pride."

7
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,625
"I didn't change my cap,
I didn't change my Nike."

8
00:01:26,707 --> 00:01:29,625
"But since I have come,
I changed the car."

9
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:32,957
"They try very hard.
But this is my time."

10
00:01:33,082 --> 00:01:36,000
"I still dine at a five
star hotel with Gippi Grewal."

11
00:01:36,082 --> 00:01:39,415
"My lifestyle is like a movie.
I'm like a movie star."

12
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,000
"There is no gap in my rap
which my best attack."

13
00:01:41,082 --> 00:01:43,082
"You too should rap like me."

14
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,000
"I don't talk big."

15
00:01:47,332 --> 00:01:49,332
"I don't show off."

16
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:52,750
"I don't care a damn."

17
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:55,000
"My friend's are proud."

18
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:58,250
"My friend's are proud."

19
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,165
"My friend's are proud."

20
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,665
"My friend's are proud."

21
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:08,000
"I ride my Ducati
at the speed of 150."

22
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,500
"My friend's are proud."

23
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:14,832
"My friend's are proud."

24
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:17,625
"My friend's are proud."

25
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:20,582
"I ride my Ducati
at the speed of 150."

26
00:02:20,665 --> 00:02:24,290
"Black ride and black kurta-pajama."

27
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,582
"I wear it because I like it."

28
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:30,625
"Chandigardh and Mohali is my town."

29
00:02:30,707 --> 00:02:33,707
"I take my sports car
and can never be caught."

30
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,957
"I don't call anyone's culture fake."

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,957
"I sing Gurdas Maan's Rees
or even Drake where I please."

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,457
"I don't talk big."

33
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:48,750
Ekom.

34
00:02:49,957 --> 00:02:52,875
Just like other Punjabi boys, he
too dreamed to go outside his country.

35
00:02:53,332 --> 00:02:55,915
In the official manner
or in the unofficial manner.

36
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,207
His dream was fulfilled,
just like his personality...

37
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,415
by taking the official path.
For studies.

38
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:13,207
Lord, bless me and reach
me to my destination well.

39
00:03:14,415 --> 00:03:15,832
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

40
00:03:16,457 --> 00:03:18,165
Hello, where are you?

41
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,415
At the fields.

42
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,915
-Hello.
-Welcome aboard.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,375
Who are you saying hello to?

44
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,707
That was aunt...

45
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,978
she has come to the fields
to pluck some spinach....

46
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:26,375
Listen...

47
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:27,915
I'll call you later.

48
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,832
Let me put this off.

49
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:31,207
Welcome aboard.

50
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,707
It is so difficult
to get a visa to America.

51
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,875
One should ask a person like me.

52
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:40,540
It is as difficult as finding God.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,915
Mother had said don't
do anything wrong.

54
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,582
I have got a great seat.

55
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,540
You are very fortunate.

56
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,375
It's okay.
If I feel hot, I'll open the window.

57
00:03:57,457 --> 00:03:59,832
-Excuse me.
- Sir.

58
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:10,915
"I will not let you
become someone else's."

59
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:16,082
"I will not let you
belong to a stranger."

60
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,582
"I will not let you
become someone else's."

61
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:32,958
"I will not let you
belong to a stranger."

62
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:38,750
"I will fight with my God.."

63
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:44,375
"..and will have you
destined in my life."

64
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,291
"I will fight with my God.."

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,875
A breeze is blowing
in the plane too.

66
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,708
But her seat cannot be 13B.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,583
I am not so fortunate.

68
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,958
Excuse me.
13B... that's my seat.

69
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,625
Please come. Come.

70
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,375
When one gets an American visa...

71
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,082
even God comes closer and listens.

72
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:09,040
Did you say something?

73
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:13,083
I was saying that are
you too going to America?

74
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,208
We all are going to America.

75
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:18,582
Really? So no one is
getting off on the way?

76
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:20,790
-Excuse me?
-Just kidding.

77
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,416
What is it?
Did you want to get off on the way?

78
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:26,790
No, no. I have a ticket till America.

79
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,583
Actually I brought food from home.

80
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,833
So I thought if we stop somewhere...

81
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,332
I will have it heated up.

82
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,916
Are you going to America
for the first time?

83
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,333
Yes, yes. First time.

84
00:05:38,415 --> 00:05:41,957
I'm Ekomkar Singh Grewal.
BPO Kumbhkela, District Ludhiana...

85
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,707
Punjab, India, phone no.
9-8-7-2-7-1-5-0-4-6...

86
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,040
student visa,
two year cooking course...

87
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:50,915
Freemonte University.
Want to open a restaurant in India.

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,290
I'm totally prepared for
the questions at the immigration.

89
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:59,083
Can I tell you a secret?
All this is planned.

90
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,000
Cooking is just an excuse.

91
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,208
I have everything planned.
I was a little weak in English.

92
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:08,665
But now I have learned it.
With six band hits.

93
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,708
Hi, I'm Jasmine. I live in America.

94
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,790
I came to Chandigarh
for a cousin's wedding.

95
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,375
I see.

96
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:20,750
You must have got a lot
of respect during the wedding?

97
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,916
We respect people
who stay abroad a lot.

98
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,125
Anyway, people who stay
in America are respected a lot.

99
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,416
Where do you live in America?

100
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,166
Why? Do you need help?

101
00:06:29,415 --> 00:06:33,832
No, no need for help.
I will send some cards on festivals.

102
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,625
And when we get close...

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,665
I will have you get
some sweets from the village.

104
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,375
You're unbelievable.

105
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,750
Same to you.

106
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,875
Are you sleepy?

107
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:59,375
"I will not lose you."

108
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:04,958
"I will never separate from you."

109
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,250
"I will not lose you."

110
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:21,916
"I will never separate from you."

111
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:29,166
"Even if you hurt me, I promise.."

112
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:34,541
"..I will take it with a smile."

113
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,040
-Okay, then... I must go.
-Yes.

114
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,625
The immigration line for you is there.

115
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,708
-Okay.
-Okay.

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,833
Bye.

117
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:47,000
Same to you.

118
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:49,916
Excuse me.

119
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,208
Yes.

120
00:07:51,915 --> 00:07:52,582
Bye.

121
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:53,625
Bye.

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,750
Bye.

123
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,000
-What is this?
-What's the matter?

124
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,875
Don't you want to send
me cards during festivals?

125
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:11,082
I want to send it.

126
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:13,540
I live close to your University.

127
00:08:13,915 --> 00:08:14,915
Really?

128
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,833
Okay. Bye.

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Again?

130
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,708
Your hand is very...

131
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,750
Very soft.

132
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,166
-Ekom....
-Yes.

133
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:26,958
Bye.

134
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,125
Bye.

135
00:08:33,332 --> 00:08:36,750
Look mother,
your son has reached America.

136
00:08:41,082 --> 00:08:42,832
Excuse me,
can I see your passport please.

137
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:45,750
-Passport?
-Yes. Passport, please.

138
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,583
Two years study visa course.

139
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,666
Ekomkar Singh Grewal, my name.

140
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,166
And whenever there is
a Punjabi criminal case...

141
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:06,375
they just take one name.

142
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,875
Sergeant Jasjeet Singh Sandhu.

143
00:09:14,082 --> 00:09:16,957
Sir, my name is Ekomkar Singh.

144
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,041
I don't even know Shinda.

145
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:21,500
I have been telling this
to everyone since morning.

146
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:23,207
I'm tired of telling this.

147
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,166
You know better that
you are Shinda or Ekom.

148
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,957
But we won't let you
leave till we confirm it.

149
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,166
But who is Shinda anyway?

150
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,875
John, can you please get the monitor?

151
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:38,791
Yes sir.

152
00:10:00,957 --> 00:10:04,000
Shinda was a hardcore
criminal in Los Angeles.

153
00:10:05,457 --> 00:10:06,540
He is accused of the murder of...

154
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,250
two policemen and three civilians.

155
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:12,000
That's shocking!

156
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,958
He looks exactly like me.

157
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,666
Last year police held
an operation on 8th november.

158
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,833
during which,
Shinda died in a bomb blast.

159
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,707
Sir, if Shinda is dead,
why are you after me?

160
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,791
I'm here for studies.

161
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,750
God knows how my mother
managed to send me here.

162
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:38,750
The police just assume
that Shinda died in that blast.

163
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,791
When his body was
found by the police...

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,666
it was so badly burnt
that it couldn't be identified.

165
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:47,500
We didn't even have
his blood identity...

166
00:10:47,582 --> 00:10:49,832
because he was
living here illegally.

167
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,875
We believe that the corpse was Shinda.

168
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,250
And now Shinda lookalike
is sitting in front of us.

169
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,207
And now seeing you we feel...

170
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,291
that Shinda did not
die that day but escaped.

171
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,332
You are permitted
to make a phone call.

172
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,082
But if you want,
you can be granted...

173
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,041
ea lawyer by the government.

174
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:14,750
'What's the matter?'

175
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:16,540
'Don't you want to send
me cards during festivals?'

176
00:11:18,707 --> 00:11:19,915
I want to make a call.

177
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,708
-Number?
-7-1-4...

178
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,875
4-4-3...

179
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,416
1-5-9-4.

180
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,625
This is serious.

181
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,041
And it's unfortunate
that you're involved.

182
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:44,250
Look, I'm not a lawyer...
and I don't even know one.

183
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,166
Don't think that I
don't want to help you.

184
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,875
I will do whatever I can to help.

185
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,833
Yes. There is a lawyer in Los Angeles.

186
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,625
Karanvir Jatala.

187
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,708
He is one of the topmost
lawyers of California.

188
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,707
I've heard that he even goes
out of his way to help Punjabis.

189
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,375
Something or the other
is always in the news about him.

190
00:12:13,082 --> 00:12:16,457
I'll go and speak to him.

191
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,832
Good morning.

192
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:33,875
Good morning.

193
00:12:34,082 --> 00:12:35,665
-How are you doing?
-Great. You?

194
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm fine. Thank you.

195
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,916
-Please, come up to my office.
-Sure.

196
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,957
First I will investigate
on this case on my level.

197
00:12:43,707 --> 00:12:44,957
I need all the details
of Ekom's passport...

198
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,832
his residential address,
and if he has any relatives...

199
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,125
in America, then their addresses...

200
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:54,750
and the details about
all the family members back home.

201
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,000
Sir, whatever you explained
to me over the phone...

202
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,541
I have already brought
all those details.

203
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:05,250
He just has a mother in his family,
no one else.

204
00:13:06,582 --> 00:13:07,250
Fine.

205
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,750
I will have a look
at it and get back to you.

206
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,707
Okay, sir.

207
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:13,875
Take care.

208
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,458
Look, son...

209
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:25,125
before taking up your case,
I want to ask you...

210
00:13:25,582 --> 00:13:28,332
a few questions
for my satisfaction.

211
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:36,125
If you need my help,
then tell me the entire truth clearly.

212
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,458
Yes.

213
00:13:40,332 --> 00:13:43,582
If you hide anything or I find out
that even a single thing is a lie...

214
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,000
then you'll have to rot
behind these bars all your life.

215
00:13:48,957 --> 00:13:50,000
Absolutely.

216
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,166
I cannot thank you enough
that you have come to meet me.

217
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,083
Do you have any relatives in America?

218
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:02,916
No. All my relatives
are in Mogha and Maansa.

219
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,208
No one has seen anything outside that.

220
00:14:05,707 --> 00:14:09,625
I have an uncle who works at a bank.

221
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:13,165
He sometimes visits Chandigarh.
To take part in some agitation.

222
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,416
Address? Where do you live?

223
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:19,750
BPO Kumbhkela,
District Ludhiana, Punjab, India.

224
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:21,957
What are your parent's names?

225
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,708
My father's name is Late Mr.
Laxman Singh...

226
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,250
and my mother Mrs. Mahendar Kaur.

227
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,166
Your school and college?

228
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,957
1st and 2nd grade was
in the village school.

229
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,707
Till the 12th grade
DAV College Samrala.

230
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,125
Who else is in your family?

231
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,875
Just me and my mother.

232
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,625
Now mother is alone because I am here.

233
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,625
Okay. I'll begin the
investigation from my end.

234
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,666
And you...

235
00:14:55,332 --> 00:14:57,000
Just sign on these papers.

236
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,332
Take.

237
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,707
Sign it. They are
not your property papers.

238
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,875
We had two acres.

239
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,707
We had to mortgage
that too to come here.

240
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,707
Mr. Sandhu.

241
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:42,582
Pause it here.

242
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:52,333
Yes.

243
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:57,415
Mr. Sandhu,
this boy is absolutely right.

244
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,000
He is not Shinda.

245
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:03,750
He's Ekomkar Singh Grewal.

246
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,957
Mr. Jatala, I didn't get you.

247
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:11,290
Yes, Mr. Sandhu.
Look at this video carefully.

248
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:13,875
Shinda shot with his right hand...

249
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:16,290
and he shot both men on their head...

250
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:18,957
at a distance of
almost seven meters.

251
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:22,957
It means that Shinda was right-handed.

252
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,582
And a left-handed person can never...

253
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:29,083
be so accurate with his right hand...

254
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,582
and that too at a distance
of almost seven meters.

255
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,875
Right?

256
00:16:35,457 --> 00:16:39,290
This boy is lefty.
He signed these papers...

257
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,375
right in front of
me with his left hand.

258
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:44,125
Yes.

259
00:16:44,957 --> 00:16:46,165
That's a valid point.

260
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,500
Yeah.

261
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:51,875
-Hello.
-Hello.

262
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:52,790
Mahendar Kaur?

263
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,500
-Yes.
-Just a moment.

264
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,041
Yes, sir. I have Ekom's mother
on the line. Should I put her through?

265
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,500
Yes, put her through.

266
00:17:01,707 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

267
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,250
Hello.

268
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:08,875
Hello, aunt.

269
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,832
Hello.

270
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,040
Hello, aunt.

271
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,040
Hello, who are you?

272
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,375
-I'm Karanvir Jatala from America.
-Jatala?

273
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,791
Ekom's teacher.

274
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:20,207
Hello, son. Bless you.

275
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:24,125
Is everything fine?
Did Ekom reach there safely?

276
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:28,458
He didn't even call.
I'm really worried.

277
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,790
Yes. He's absolutely fine.
Don't worry about him.

278
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,333
He's a very good boy.

279
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:35,125
Yes, that is true.

280
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,166
Aunt, I have a few questions for you.

281
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,458
This is a formality in our college.

282
00:17:40,915 --> 00:17:42,415
Yes, tell me son.

283
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,415
Is everything alright?

284
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:06,500
Yes, he's fine.
His class begins from tomorrow.

285
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,415
Son, if he does not do
his homework then scold him.

286
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,541
A teacher is also like one's parents.

287
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,375
Yes, you can stop worrying about him.

288
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:20,708
He is my only son. All alone.

289
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,750
Now, son, he is in your hands.

290
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:27,916
Son, if he is nearby,
can I talk to him?

291
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,415
No problem, aunt.
Now he's in his room.

292
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,541
He will call you as
soon as he gets his mobile.

293
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:35,791
Okay.

294
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,290
Don't worry, I'm here.

295
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,000
Okay son. Bless you.

296
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:42,915
-Okay.
-Bye.

297
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,415
Bye.

298
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,125
Hello, Jasmine.

299
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,166
Hello sir.

300
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,458
I think I'll take this case.

301
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,375
Great.

302
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,750
Thank you so much sir.

303
00:19:02,915 --> 00:19:05,207
So that we can save an innocent boy.

304
00:19:05,415 --> 00:19:07,500
Okay. Absolutely, sir.

305
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,540
Sir, we have come to know that...

306
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,040
Shinda's aunt stays
at Blue Water Street.

307
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,333
I have heard that
Shinda would stay there.

308
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,250
Brilliant.

309
00:19:14,415 --> 00:19:15,915
Let's start the case with this first.

310
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,250
-Devinder Kaur?
-Yes.

311
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,333
Shinda was my elder sister's son.

312
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,040
He came to America through
Mexico in an illegal manner.

313
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,208
He stayed for 2-3 years in Sacramento.

314
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:49,290
But couldn't stay permanently.

315
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,583
Then he came here.

316
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:55,291
He and Sunny used
to go to work together.

317
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,957
What work did he do?

318
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,040
You know what other
Punjabi boys do here.

319
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,165
Shinda played Kabbadi in India.

320
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,791
He used to go many
times at nights here too.

321
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:14,250
He would tell me,
"Aunt, I'm going to do wrestling."

322
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:18,916
And I would say, "Wrestling?
What wrestling goes on here?"

323
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,083
He would say,
the ones that foreigners do.

324
00:20:23,415 --> 00:20:25,082
And they have a good name too.

325
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,500
That white day of 7th November...

326
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,083
was a dark night for us.

327
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,832
Sunny and Shinda left
but didn't come back.

328
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,708
How did you learn about Shinda?

329
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:43,582
I read in the newspaper the next day.

330
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,332
After I read it,
I felt like I'm dying.

331
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Sunny is still missing.

332
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,832
Was Shinda permanent here?

333
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,916
No. But he was very happy.

334
00:20:56,665 --> 00:20:59,290
He had a friend named Nicky.

335
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,165
She was a Punjabi
and she was born here.

336
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:06,250
They both were very happy.

337
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,290
He would say that
he would marry her...

338
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,000
and become a permanent citizen.

339
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:13,915
Even I was extremely happy.

340
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,625
Mothers always pray for
the well being of their sons.

341
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,958
But God had planned
something else for him.

342
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:28,125
Wonder who cast an
evil eye on our happiness.

343
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:32,665
I just have their photos now.

344
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,875
Aunt, can we see their rooms.

345
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,000
It's possible that we find a clue.

346
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,707
Yes, sure.

347
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:38,916
Since brother Shinda came in my life,
I felt complete.

348
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:43,415
Laughing, enjoying,
dancing, playing, a lot of fun.

349
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:47,458
Every day is filled
with joy and colorful.

350
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,415
Sir, I have found this diary.

351
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,416
I guess it belongs to Sunny.

352
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:03,790
3rd November,
today is brother Shinda's 8th fight.

353
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:08,957
Nowadays, brother Shinda
is at the peak in street fights.

354
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,665
And I am too because
of brother Shinda.

355
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,665
They say the fighter in
today's fight is very strong.

356
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:30,125
"I ride my Ducati
at the speed of 150."

357
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:35,582
"They try very hard.
Everyone talks about me."

358
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,790
So buddy, you want to put
money on any of the fighters?

359
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,458
I put 500 on Michal.

360
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,915
This is Sunny. Innocent.

361
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,750
He thinks from his heart,
not his mind.

362
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:56,832
That's why Shinda's life...

363
00:23:56,915 --> 00:23:58,040
I will bet on Michael.

364
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:00,582
-Michael?
-Yes, its Michael.

365
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,333
Good luck, buddy.

366
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:10,083
-You did the right thing.
-Yeah, yeah.

367
00:24:13,665 --> 00:24:16,290
Brother, are you going to bet today?

368
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,375
500 on Shinda.

369
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,458
-You have made a great choice.
-Yeah.

370
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:29,750
Captain.
God knows why he called Captain.

371
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:33,790
But he is definitely the
captain of street fighting.

372
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:37,000
He hunts for the best fighters
from the small fights...

373
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,458
and makes them do bigger fights,
that's his hobby.

374
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,458
-3-4-5. It's 700, buddy.
-Yeah.

375
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:51,125
"Nowadays the kids are acting smart,
we say these things are old."

376
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,125
That's my brother.

377
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:57,666
"Nowadays the kids are acting smart,
we say these things are old."

378
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:01,500
He is the guy who has
been talking lots of noise.

379
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,458
"They will burn the surroundings."

380
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,250
"They will lift weapons
if anyone beats them."

381
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:10,000
"The one who saw his day rise
from the rooftop in the village."

382
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:15,250
"The one who saw his day rise
from the rooftop in the village."

383
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,458
Goodbye, Michael.

384
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,415
"He single handedly is enough."

385
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:21,125
"The one who saw his day rise
from the rooftop in the village."

386
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:23,916
"He single handedly is enough."

387
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,165
"To say all this is very easy."

388
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:29,916
"The work we do is difficult."

389
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,708
"You don't get these
opportunities so easily."

390
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,625
"These liars deceived us."

391
00:25:36,165 --> 00:25:37,457
One...

392
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,000
"He left the house saying
he wants to be a star."

393
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,833
"Now God is looking after me."

394
00:25:43,915 --> 00:25:46,665
"Whatever I have
written is the truth."

395
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:49,375
Two...

396
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,833
"Those who were standing with us...
like pillars in difficult times."

397
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:55,666
Three...

398
00:25:55,958 --> 00:26:01,041
"Those who were standing with us...
like pillars in difficult times."

399
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:04,625
"He is made a member of the family."

400
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:07,250
"After winning he will be proud."

401
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:08,666
Come on.

402
00:26:10,165 --> 00:26:12,040
Get up, brother Shinda! Get up!

403
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,540
Come on!

404
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,833
Get up! Get up!

405
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,666
"The one who saw his day rise
from the rooftop in the village."

406
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,833
-Four...
-Yes.

407
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:29,791
Get up, Shinde!

408
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,415
Come on, Shinde! Get up!

409
00:26:33,665 --> 00:26:35,290
Yo!

410
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:37,915
-Yes!
-That's the man!

411
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:40,083
Yeah!

412
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:09,457
This is Shinda.
Self willed, happy and proud.

413
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,875
The one who has come to ground people.

414
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:18,208
People say that Shinda makes
decisions for love with his heart...

415
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,207
and for battles, with his hands.

416
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,208
You were amazing, brother!

417
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,375
Come let me introduce
you to Captain. Come.

418
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:41,833
Did you see our tiger, sir?
He shattered him in a punch.

419
00:27:41,915 --> 00:27:43,832
Yes, brilliant!

420
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,875
Captain likes tigers too.

421
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:50,458
Not the ones in circus, but like him.

422
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,833
Open.

423
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,000
You have something special in you.

424
00:27:54,415 --> 00:27:56,207
-Who is he?
-He's my brother.

425
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,458
My aunt's son. Shinda.

426
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:01,625
He has come from
Sacramento some time back.

427
00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:03,332
And he is Captain.

428
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:07,125
He has a great reputation between
the night lovers of Las Vegas.

429
00:28:09,915 --> 00:28:13,207
A diamond's value is only
known when a jeweler sees it.

430
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,458
Think big. Raise your level.

431
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:23,040
A tiger doesn't have any difficulty
in killing a deer, eagle or a snake.

432
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,000
If I come down to show my talent...

433
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,750
you will forget all your levels.

434
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:36,458
I do as I please.
I fight where I wish to.

435
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:41,665
23, 24, 24 and a half and 25,000.

436
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,125
A prize of 25,000 from
the English wrestling.

437
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:50,166
Today we will drink liquor
and shake the ground and enjoy.

438
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,750
-You should join us, sir.
-No, no.

439
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:57,332
You enjoy the function. I must leave.

440
00:28:58,165 --> 00:29:02,082
But surely come if you
can really shake the ground.

441
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,333
I'll wait.

442
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,166
Come, Sunny.

443
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:24,790
"The line on the metal is difficult."

444
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:28,790
"They give me respect like a kid."

445
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,165
"The line on the metal is difficult."

446
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:37,041
"They give me respect like a kid."

447
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:40,166
"Keep your hopes high."

448
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:42,875
"They will come back."

449
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:46,666
"The one who saw his day rise
from the rooftop in the village."

450
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:49,832
"The one who saw his day rise
from the rooftop in the village."

451
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:52,707
"He single handedly is enough."

452
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,375
"The one who saw his day rise
from the rooftop in the village."

453
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,540
"He single handedly is enough."

454
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:04,333
"After drinking, the Jatt.."

455
00:30:04,415 --> 00:30:08,165
-"..is romaing the streets."
-Cheers!

456
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,583
-Hey Sunny Singh.
-Yes.

457
00:30:10,665 --> 00:30:15,165
They all say...
This liquor is to talks...

458
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,707
You must see beautiful
dreams after drinking.

459
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,083
Really?

460
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,790
Tell me, which beautiful
dream did you see?

461
00:30:26,165 --> 00:30:27,332
I?

462
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:32,040
I am riding a tractor in the fields.

463
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,875
There is a girl named
Nicky sitting on the tractor.

464
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,000
There is smoke coming
from the silencer...

465
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:42,875
and the tractor
is making weird noises.

466
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,457
Brother, what kind of a dream is this?

467
00:30:47,665 --> 00:30:54,125
Listen. Idiot,
behind the tractor there were ants.

468
00:30:54,333 --> 00:31:01,166
And Nicky's hair is
flying with the breeze.

469
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:06,125
Only you and Nicky are in this dream.

470
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,375
You've cut my scene.

471
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,915
Idiot, look.

472
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:18,500
The one bringing the tea in an urn...
that's you.

473
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,791
Really? You both
will have tea together.

474
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,875
Even in your dreams you have tea.

475
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,583
Come on, listen.

476
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,665
Don't say stupid things.

477
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,458
You realize how late it is?
You have to rise early tomorrow.

478
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:41,582
No, no. Tonight I'll go to the casino.

479
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,290
Hey, idiot,
you want to go to the casino?

480
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,915
Whenever we go to the casino drunk...

481
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,708
they kick us out.

482
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:52,375
Today is our lucky day, bro.

483
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,666
A target is never
missed by the tiger...

484
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:02,790
and beating Sunny
in gambling is not easy.

485
00:32:04,165 --> 00:32:08,125
Listen, Listen everyone.

486
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:10,166
The ants are suffering from cold.

487
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:21,833
Hey, don't lose and come,
for God's sake.

488
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,125
Brother, you have a right.

489
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,000
How much did you lose?

490
00:33:22,915 --> 00:33:24,290
That's what I'm unable to tell you.

491
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,165
Is something wrong with your tongue?

492
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,333
Tell me.

493
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,290
$1 lakh.

494
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,166
How much?

495
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:36,250
I'm ashamed of myself.

496
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,625
Where did you pay the
rest of the 80,000 from?

497
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:43,040
I took 80,000 from Frank.

498
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:47,500
Brother Shinda,
I will never gamble again.

499
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:49,916
You decided that very soon.

500
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:53,166
Frank kills people even for $500.

501
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:55,083
How did he spare you?

502
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,500
He has given me 48 hours.

503
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,665
Brother Shinda...

504
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:01,291
Yes, tell me.

505
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:02,583
Help me this time.

506
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:08,375
Please.

507
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:15,208
Nobody is going to
lend us so much money.

508
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:24,708
Call your friend Captain.

509
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
He was talking big last night.

510
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:43,541
Welcome.

511
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,333
Sit, sit.

512
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,875
I told you that I'll wait.

513
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:58,166
But I'm happy that you came today.

514
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:04,125
But Sunny, you know what
the best move in gambling is?

515
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,333
Which?

516
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:10,083
Stay away from gambling.

517
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:18,541
All this my hobby
as well as my passion.

518
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:21,708
My passion is business.

519
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:28,041
A business is not built by force,
but my mind.

520
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:32,166
My mind says not to pay you.

521
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:37,541
Frank is behind you.
Then i'm behind you.

522
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:46,083
Being a Punjabi, I will tell
you that people like Frank are crazy.

523
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,833
We are crazy too.

524
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:58,375
-If you're a businessman, talk like one.
-Keep quiet.

525
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,375
We need the money in two days.

526
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,000
Will you fight?

527
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:12,583
When?

528
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:17,875
In Downtown, there is a secret
fight organized every Sunday.

529
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,708
'Do or Die'.

530
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:23,541
If you win, means killing a man.

531
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:27,291
But if you lose, you die.

532
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:34,166
All the millionaires bet there.

533
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,833
I will bet $2 lakhs on you.

534
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:39,458
If you win, I will win four times...

535
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:40,875
and 2 lakhs will be yours.

536
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:44,625
But if your lose,
I will lose my money...

537
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,666
and you will lose everything.

538
00:36:57,791 --> 00:37:01,041
Pardon us, sir. We don't
need to fight at such a place.

539
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:04,041
My brother's life isn't that cheap.

540
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:10,583
You arrange the fight.
We'll meet on Sunday.

541
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:14,166
Done.

542
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:15,875
Come on, Sunny.

543
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,208
Brother Shinda,
if something happens to you...

544
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,541
I won't stay alive either.

545
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:40,375
Sunny, you worry on the
day when 5-7 men surround me.

546
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:45,083
When it's one-on-one,
nobody can beat your brother.

547
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:47,125
This job is very difficult.

548
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:53,083
Yes. But we will not
get much from an easy job.

549
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:56,583
Anyway, we have three options.

550
00:37:57,125 --> 00:38:00,333
If I didn't fight, you'll die alone.

551
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,166
But if I fight and lose,
we both will die.

552
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,708
But if I fight and win,
we both will be saved.

553
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:50,791
Life has been testing
us at every turn.

554
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,166
Why not another one?

555
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:32,250
This phase of life was very weird.

556
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:37,000
Brother Shinda was looking
into the eyes of death for me.

557
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:43,125
All the limits of bravery
ended at brother Shinda.

558
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:55,541
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's a beautiful evening...

559
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:58,083
and we have some great
fight lined up for you guys.

560
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:13,166
So let's welcome the
four time champion Pablo.

561
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:29,166
And for the very first time,
let's welcome Shinda.

562
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:45,125
Let's have some fun, baby.

563
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:53,625
Pablo, lets go take him down.

564
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:58,625
That's my dog! Make me some money.

565
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:03,541
Go on, show him who is the boss!
I'm the boss!

566
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,666
Make him feel the pain! Holla!

567
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:26,875
That's my boy!

568
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,250
Yeah that's my homie!

569
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:47,000
Yeah baby, take him now.

570
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:13,625
That's my boy! Get up!

571
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,000
Yeah!

572
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:49,583
Get back in there!

573
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:53,083
Pablo, what are you playing yet?

574
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:54,833
Don't disappoint me.

575
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:57,541
I've got half a
million ridding on you.

576
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,041
Pablo, get up!

577
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:08,750
Do you hear me? Get up!

578
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:11,989
He doesn't realize I have
half a million riding on him.

579
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:12,666
Pablo, get up.

580
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:26,708
Finish him!

581
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:47,500
What the heck!

582
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:53,708
No!

583
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,208
Pablo, get up!

584
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:07,166
That's your only way out.

585
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:08,958
Finish him!

586
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:12,958
Pablo, please!

587
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,666
Up, up! Get up!

588
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:41,666
Finished!

589
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:49,166
Forgive me for this sin, Lord!

590
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:30,000
Sunny, you were the one who gambled...

591
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:35,833
but he lost the game.

592
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:51,625
You were great.

593
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,375
I knew it that killing
makes one feel amazing.

594
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:58,291
I have a principle in life...

595
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:01,375
that nobody has
a tear in their eyes...

596
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,458
because of me, but for me.

597
00:46:06,291 --> 00:46:08,375
You can never be a
star with honesty, Shinda.

598
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,916
You can never rule by being honest.

599
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,166
You have to put fear in their minds.

600
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:18,291
The way a tree does
not eat its own fruits.

601
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:21,291
Rivers do not drink their own water.

602
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:26,166
Similarly Shinda doesn't
live for himself but for his family.

603
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:29,583
Now you have
killed just one, Shinda.

604
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:31,625
You still have to kill 25 more.

605
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,250
Once you kill the 26th,
then you'll win Captain's heart.

606
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:37,958
If you doubt it, then try me.

607
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:52,500
When your Captain feels
he is a burden on this land...

608
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:54,791
call me...

609
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,916
I will be there.

610
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:03,083
Even if it's the middle of the night.

611
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:10,500
Come on, Sunny.

612
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:25,750
He talks like a poisonous snake.

613
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:30,791
I never found someone so
intimidating in just two days.

614
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:39,958
From the money Shinda won,
he returned to Frank $80,000...

615
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:42,208
and pulled me out of the death trap.

616
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:45,208
Our lives were going really well.

617
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:47,208
We were enjoying our lives.

618
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:50,166
I and brother Shinda
both were very happy.

619
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:54,166
Sunny, I must declare
something clearly.

620
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,458
What, brother?

621
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:58,854
Boys and girls in Delhi, Kolkata,
and Bangalore go on dates.

622
00:47:58,855 --> 00:47:59,875
Yes.

623
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:02,625
But boys and girls from Batinda,
Maansa, Mogha...

624
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:03,916
and Ludhiana go on scheduled dates.

625
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,333
That's true.

626
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:09,625
If I were not living here...

627
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,791
I would not be going on
American dates, but scheduled dates.

628
00:48:17,916 --> 00:48:19,250
It's the same case here.

629
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,291
The only difference
is that the dates there...

630
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:23,958
are during the day,
and here they are at night.

631
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:33,208
Idiot. If you and Nicky weren't
in my lives, I would be lost.

632
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:36,750
I would be craving
for love all my life.

633
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:42,250
My father has seen me
from the heavens growing up.

634
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:47,416
He must be happy to see us happy.

635
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:51,000
Yes, brother.

636
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:53,833
I'm sure the sound of our
laughter must be reaching up there.

637
00:48:56,791 --> 00:48:58,875
And uncle must be shouting out...

638
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:02,583
"Look at my tiger!
He shattered him in a punch!"

639
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:26,958
Captain.

640
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:30,250
Hello.

641
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:31,250
Sunny!

642
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:33,125
-Yes, brother.
-Where are you?

643
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:38,291
There is a blast here.
I took a five lakh bet for Shinda.

644
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,583
Five lakh.

645
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:42,000
Whatever we win will
be divided in half.

646
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:45,125
You know, 50-50.

647
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:50,166
Ask Shinda to be prepared.
The fight is day after tomorrow.

648
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:52,250
Brother, one minute.

649
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:55,625
Brother Shinda, Captain just called.

650
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:57,875
He has bet half million on you.

651
00:49:58,166 --> 00:49:59,750
He has asked you to
be prepared for the fight.

652
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:01,750
Tell him that I won't fight.

653
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:07,041
Has he gone crazy?
I have taken up the bet already.

654
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:08,250
Get him on the phone.

655
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:10,541
Sure.

656
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:12,541
Brother Shinda.

657
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:26,791
Captain, you memory is a little weak.

658
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:31,250
I had told you earlier
too but you forgot about it.

659
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,208
I do as I please.

660
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:37,250
I fight where I want to.

661
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,166
Goodbye.

662
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,333
Sir, should I say yes for the fight?

663
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:51,291
Deal cancelled.

664
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:53,333
Cancelled.

665
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:06,958
Nicky's phone is switched off.

666
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:10,416
-Where did you ask her to wait?
-Right here.

667
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:12,708
We'll wait here. You
go inside and check.

668
00:51:12,709 --> 00:51:13,375
Yes.

669
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:14,833
Okay.

670
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:17,708
Careful.

671
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,208
-So, Preeti...
-What else?

672
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,416
He left.

673
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,458
So what is it?

674
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:33,208
-Give me a kiss quickly.
-Why?

675
00:51:54,916 --> 00:51:57,833
Shinda, don't speak. And don't panic.

676
00:51:57,916 --> 00:51:59,458
Just listen calmly.

677
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:02,625
You have 48 hours to arrange
half a million dollars...

678
00:52:02,875 --> 00:52:05,416
then we will peacefully
give Nicky back to you.

679
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:07,125
In case of failure...

680
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:09,125
we will send her dead body to you.

681
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:12,583
I will call you back
to let you know the location...

682
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:14,250
and where to bring the money.

683
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:34,916
No, no. The deal hasn't been canceled.

684
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,541
It was someone else. Someone else.

685
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,916
-Where is Nicky?
-What?

686
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:46,541
Where is Nicky?

687
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:49,291
-Who Nicky?
-Don't act innocent.

688
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,416
Tell me clearly.

689
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,041
Someone kidnapped Nicky.

690
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:54,291
The kidnappers are
asking for $5 lakhs.

691
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:58,916
If you think that I'm involved
in this, then you both are wrong.

692
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:04,833
Yes, but to arrange the money
I can arrange a fight to help you.

693
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:07,375
I will arrange the money.

694
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:14,250
You just pray that you pay
the ransom and get Nicky back...

695
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:17,250
or else you know what they do.

696
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:21,291
I do my business straight
and you do it almost wrong.

697
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:25,458
And remember,
if anything happens to Nicky...

698
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:28,250
then your night people
who stay awake in the night...

699
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:30,041
I won't let them
sleep in the day too.

700
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:33,000
What do you think,
that Captain will fear your threats?

701
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:36,625
You're at least feeling the fear,
but you don't show it.

702
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:47,125
Call him when you have to shoot birds.

703
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,291
You need guts to kill a man.

704
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:55,291
I will remind you once again, Shinda
thinks for love from the heart...

705
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:57,458
and for battle, from the hands.

706
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:02,833
After looking at you and your people,
Captain...

707
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,541
it feels as if fireflies
are threatening to cause fire.

708
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:11,208
Whichever step you take, take smartly.

709
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:14,791
You cannot get insurance
for the one who is dead.

710
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:23,041
Remember this, Captain.

711
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:25,708
If you do something fishy...

712
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,000
then you will be
controlled by Shinda.

713
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:34,000
And only one kite will fly in the sky,
which will be Shinda's.

714
00:54:58,416 --> 00:55:00,916
An action done without
consideration is called mistake...

715
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,625
and the one done
with a lot of planning...

716
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:06,625
is conspiracy...

717
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:09,000
that Captain has done.

718
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:26,875
The man is strong.

719
00:55:27,416 --> 00:55:29,500
There can be two swords in one case...

720
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:32,166
one dull and one sharp.

721
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:35,750
But here, both of them are sharp.

722
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:39,375
One has to be taken out.

723
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:48,083
What is in this, brother?

724
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:52,125
-Newspaper.
-Newspaper?

725
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:54,250
And the money?

726
00:55:57,458 --> 00:55:58,541
What do we do now?

727
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:03,208
You drive.
I have thought of something.

728
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:33,416
Brother Shinda, Nicky isn't here.

729
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:35,750
It doesn't feel right.

730
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:48,833
Brother Shinda!

731
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:50,291
They escaped, brother?

732
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:52,250
He didn't escape,
someone helped him. Come on.

733
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,250
Come on.

734
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:30,291
I'll go here.

735
00:59:30,541 --> 00:59:32,041
You go there.

736
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:33,791
Okay.

737
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:35,500
All the best.

738
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,041
Nicky?

739
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:42,166
How is Nicky?

740
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:46,083
She is fine now. She is sleeping.

741
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:05,708
Brother, this means
the police is also with him.

742
01:02:06,708 --> 01:02:07,583
It looks like that.

743
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:28,458
My God!

744
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:41,958
Captain.

745
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:45,666
Take it.

746
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:50,208
Sunny...

747
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:52,958
let me talk to Shinda.

748
01:03:03,291 --> 01:03:04,625
Tell me, Captain.

749
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:08,958
Before you destroy my night life...

750
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:12,125
I thought I must let you know...

751
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:14,208
who kidnapped Nicky?

752
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:16,541
Come tomorrow morning at 11.

753
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:20,041
I will show you the man
whom you are looking for.

754
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:30,791
Captain is behind all of this.

755
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:32,708
What did he say?

756
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,833
There is a bridge
outside LA North-side.

757
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:39,166
He asked me to come
there at 11ªm tomorrow.

758
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:43,916
I hope we don't get
into trouble by going there.

759
01:03:45,291 --> 01:03:49,083
We are already in trouble. Let's go.

760
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:50,750
We'll see what happens.

761
01:03:53,458 --> 01:03:54,500
Mission.

762
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,250
This diary ends here.

763
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:03,250
This is till the 6th.

764
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:07,458
This means that Shinda
and Sunny went there on the 7th.

765
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:11,291
But what happened after that?

766
01:04:13,166 --> 01:04:18,000
Only Captain can tell
us or that girl Nicky.

767
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:24,916
Anyway, tomorrow I'll ask for the
next hearing at court from the judge.

768
01:04:27,708 --> 01:04:29,875
But now we have to
find out about Captain.

769
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:36,166
Jasmine, go and meet Ekom.

770
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:38,125
He must be worried.

771
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,458
-And give him all this information.
-Yes, sir.

772
01:04:45,125 --> 01:04:46,333
Jasmine, I...

773
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,708
Ekom, don't worry.

774
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:49,916
You will be proved
innocent in the court.

775
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:52,958
For sure.

776
01:05:08,125 --> 01:05:20,750
"I make my beloved's picture and cry."

777
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:32,166
"I make images on paper and cry."

778
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:42,041
"I take some mud and go on a war."

779
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:54,916
"I draw a Romeo and Juliet and cry."

780
01:05:57,583 --> 01:06:09,250
"I draw a Romeo and Juliet and cry."

781
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:21,750
Shinda?

782
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,250
Yes. Shinda.

783
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,625
I thought you were dead.

784
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:29,250
I was peacefully dead...

785
01:07:29,583 --> 01:07:33,125
but you brought me to life again.

786
01:07:34,666 --> 01:07:38,041
This means what the
police is saying is right.

787
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:42,791
You didn't die that day, you escaped.

788
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:44,416
Escaped.

789
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:50,958
I escaped from LA.

790
01:07:52,291 --> 01:07:54,708
But you will have to
escape from this world.

791
01:08:41,457 --> 01:08:45,625
Lord, protect us.
I hope this dream doesn't come true.

792
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:48,291
An innocent life is at stake.

793
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:11,458
Ekom!

794
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:13,832
Ekom, stay down.

795
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:28,332
Ekom, save yourself.

796
01:11:28,416 --> 01:11:29,958
Get up! Run!

797
01:11:39,166 --> 01:11:41,583
Go! Go! Run!

798
01:13:47,332 --> 01:13:49,582
Excuse me, sir.
I'll be back in a minute.

799
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,332
Wait there. I'll be there right away.

800
01:14:30,082 --> 01:14:31,000
What?

801
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,541
This attack was for Shinda.

802
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:43,833
This means that Shinda's
enemies are still alert.

803
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:49,500
And this clearly means
that there's an officer...

804
01:14:49,582 --> 01:14:53,707
in the police department
who informed the attackers.

805
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:56,541
In such circumstances,
it won't be right...

806
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:59,582
to hand over Ekom to the police.

807
01:15:01,291 --> 01:15:03,041
Let me talk to the judge.

808
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:07,541
Jasmine, take Ekom to a safe place.

809
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:14,832
Your Honor, may I approach the bench?

810
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:36,500
Well, the court will reschedule
the hearing for next Wednesday.

811
01:15:36,707 --> 01:15:39,457
Please make sure your client is here.

812
01:15:57,375 --> 01:15:59,375
Come with me. Come.

813
01:16:12,875 --> 01:16:15,000
You sit.

814
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:16,916
I'll bring a bandage.

815
01:17:43,832 --> 01:17:50,290
Jasmine, if you are not around me,
I feel uneasy.

816
01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:56,708
And when you are around me,
I forget everything.

817
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:59,291
I go into a different world.

818
01:18:13,875 --> 01:18:15,916
In one breathe.

819
01:18:27,707 --> 01:18:33,000
"My soul is where you are."

820
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:38,125
"My soul is where you are."

821
01:18:38,625 --> 01:18:45,791
"The place where
we made big promises."

822
01:18:46,666 --> 01:18:52,000
"My beloved runs
like blood in my veins."

823
01:18:52,207 --> 01:18:57,957
"My beloved runs
like blood in my veins."

824
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:13,625
"Wherever you walk from,
there is your scent in the breeze."

825
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:19,708
"If I don't see you for a moment,
my heart is sad."

826
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:21,750
"My heart is sad."

827
01:19:22,207 --> 01:19:27,250
"Wherever you walk from,
there is your scent in the breeze."

828
01:19:27,707 --> 01:19:32,707
"If I don't see you for a moment,
my heart is sad."

829
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:40,791
"When I see you,
I feel I have seen God."

830
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:46,666
"My beloved runs
like blood in my veins."

831
01:19:46,707 --> 01:19:54,707
"My beloved runs
like blood in my veins."

832
01:20:05,707 --> 01:20:11,207
"When I drown in your memories,
I keep drowning."

833
01:20:11,332 --> 01:20:16,957
"I keep singing about
you all day like a song."

834
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:27,291
"When I drown in your memories,
I keep drowning."

835
01:20:27,666 --> 01:20:33,041
"I keep singing about
you all day like a song."

836
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:35,500
"I'll take you away from here."

837
01:20:35,582 --> 01:20:41,290
"I'll go along with you."

838
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:46,750
"My beloved runs
like blood in my veins."

839
01:20:46,832 --> 01:20:53,625
"My beloved runs
like blood in my veins."

840
01:21:02,957 --> 01:21:03,707
Hello.

841
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:06,666
Well, young man.
How are you? All good?

842
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,000
I am fine. I was saved.

843
01:21:10,457 --> 01:21:11,665
Ekom, you're an honest man.

844
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:13,916
And even God is on
an honest man's side.

845
01:21:15,207 --> 01:21:17,415
Even the judge has agreed
to the police's enquiry.

846
01:21:17,707 --> 01:21:21,332
Jasjit is doing the rest of the work.
He will take you.

847
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,250
But one thing is for sure...

848
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:28,125
that there is a betrayer
in the police department.

849
01:21:29,666 --> 01:21:30,875
Here too?

850
01:21:32,582 --> 01:21:33,750
Here too.

851
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:36,625
Another good thing has happened.

852
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:39,833
A close one's name has
appeared in Sunny's diary...

853
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:42,375
who has been found.

854
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,082
Who?

855
01:21:45,707 --> 01:21:48,457
Preeti. It's Preeti.

856
01:21:49,416 --> 01:21:50,875
Preeti who?

857
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:52,875
Sunny's girlfriend.

858
01:21:53,332 --> 01:21:55,625
She works at a restaurant.

859
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,875
Meeting her will help our case...

860
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,207
and I'm going to meet her.

861
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:02,125
Sir.

862
01:22:02,207 --> 01:22:03,207
Yes, tell me.

863
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,000
Can I come along?

864
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:09,500
As you wish. You come along too.

865
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,250
Where has Jasmine gone?

866
01:22:13,332 --> 01:22:15,290
She has gone to the market.
-Okay.

867
01:23:04,957 --> 01:23:06,000
Shinda!

868
01:23:06,291 --> 01:23:07,458
Preeti.

869
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:11,375
-Preeti?
-Yes.

870
01:23:11,457 --> 01:23:13,665
-You are mistaken like us.
-Yes.

871
01:23:13,957 --> 01:23:16,125
He isn't Shinda. He's Ekom.

872
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:21,791
Like the police department,
Preeti also thought Ekom was Shinda.

873
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:26,875
Lawyer Jatala told Preeti the
difference between Shinda and Ekom.

874
01:23:30,207 --> 01:23:33,790
This has become the
biggest trouble for me.

875
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:40,000
Preeti, I want to ask you
something about Shinda's friend Nicky

876
01:23:40,791 --> 01:23:42,791
Nicky was a very close
friend of mine too.

877
01:23:45,082 --> 01:23:48,790
But after Sunny and Shinda left,
we never met.

878
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,791
My life is over after Sunny left.

879
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:59,290
I have cut off from everyone.

880
01:23:59,916 --> 01:24:02,583
Just from home to shop, shop to home.

881
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:07,583
You have a picture of Nicky?

882
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:11,958
Yes, I do. It's at my house.

883
01:24:18,457 --> 01:24:20,415
-Come in.
-Thank you.

884
01:24:22,916 --> 01:24:24,791
-Nice place.
-Thank you.

885
01:24:25,082 --> 01:24:25,707
Would you like to have something?

886
01:24:25,791 --> 01:24:27,666
No. Thank you very much.

887
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:29,541
Please sit.

888
01:24:37,582 --> 01:24:41,165
It may be in this.
I'll have to check.

889
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:48,750
Got it. This is Nicky.

890
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:00,416
Jasmine?

891
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,832
You showed your true self.

892
01:25:51,375 --> 01:25:54,125
You're nothing like I thought you are.

893
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,082
Tell me what your intention was.

894
01:25:56,166 --> 01:25:56,833
Ekom!

895
01:25:57,582 --> 01:25:59,207
Ekom, leave my hand.

896
01:25:59,875 --> 01:26:01,457
Leave my hand.

897
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,625
You want to know my intentions?

898
01:26:05,707 --> 01:26:08,790
My intention was to
protect you and help you.

899
01:26:12,082 --> 01:26:15,290
After Shinda left, I went to India.

900
01:26:16,291 --> 01:26:18,916
After my wounds healed,
I came back...

901
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:21,041
and saw you in the plane.

902
01:26:22,082 --> 01:26:26,125
I knew it that you'll
be stopped at the airport.

903
01:26:27,166 --> 01:26:31,541
My only mistake is
that I see Shinda in you.

904
01:26:31,832 --> 01:26:34,000
I feel Shinda around me.

905
01:26:35,332 --> 01:26:39,582
The day Shinda died, I was with him.

906
01:26:41,207 --> 01:26:42,957
Sunny died in front of me as well.

907
01:26:43,541 --> 01:26:46,583
That day Captain had
called us outside LA...

908
01:26:46,666 --> 01:26:50,458
below a bridge at 11ªm
to tell us about the kidnappers.

909
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:30,916
You are perfectly on time, Shinda.

910
01:27:31,375 --> 01:27:32,957
You seem to be very excited.

911
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:35,957
Before fighting against the tiger...

912
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:38,416
one must learn
the rules of the jungle.

913
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:41,957
You must not act like a jackal.
Tell me where they are.

914
01:27:42,041 --> 01:27:43,291
What will you do if I tell you?

915
01:27:43,332 --> 01:27:45,165
Whatever I did to your men.

916
01:27:48,832 --> 01:27:50,665
You have crossed the limit.

917
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:53,332
You killed my five men
and you still didn't die.

918
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:55,875
You're a cheater. Cheater!

919
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,666
Cheating is worst than killing.

920
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:02,082
You shouldn't feel so bad, Shinda.

921
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,375
And Sunny, you are just caught
unnecessarily in the crossfire.

922
01:28:13,832 --> 01:28:15,707
I had sent them to kill Shinda.

923
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:20,125
But then I learnt that
Shinda's life is in Sunny.

924
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:34,207
They said "Captain,
take Shinda's life first."

925
01:28:44,832 --> 01:28:46,375
Sunny!

926
01:28:50,957 --> 01:28:52,750
Sunny!

927
01:30:35,875 --> 01:30:38,916
Nothing will happen to you, Sunny.

928
01:30:39,582 --> 01:30:41,582
I don't know how
much time I have left.

929
01:30:42,791 --> 01:30:44,625
Nothing will happen, Sunny.

930
01:30:44,791 --> 01:30:46,958
"Three... took up a free fight."

931
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:49,791
"Someone with pride
has clashed with me."

932
01:30:49,957 --> 01:30:54,125
"Captain is roaming
around killing goats."

933
01:30:54,207 --> 01:30:57,540
"Captain is roaming around.."

934
01:31:04,207 --> 01:31:06,290
Nothing will happen to you, Sunny.

935
01:31:10,707 --> 01:31:15,915
Sunny died in our arms in some time.

936
01:31:20,125 --> 01:31:21,750
Get up! Get up!

937
01:31:34,332 --> 01:31:37,415
The police was looking
for Shinda everywhere...

938
01:31:37,791 --> 01:31:41,833
and we both left the
city and went to Apple Valley.

939
01:31:42,416 --> 01:31:46,125
We took a house on
rent for some time there.

940
01:31:46,457 --> 01:31:49,750
On our way there,
we stopped at a gas station.

941
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,125
Leave it.

942
01:32:40,207 --> 01:32:42,000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

943
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,332
We left the bread at the store.

944
01:33:56,332 --> 01:33:58,375
You freshen up. I'll get it.

945
01:33:58,541 --> 01:33:59,875
-One second.
-Yes.

946
01:34:02,707 --> 01:34:04,290
Cover your face.

947
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:10,541
I'll come.

948
01:35:30,707 --> 01:35:31,665
Yes, Nicky.

949
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:34,041
Shinda, the police has come outside.

950
01:35:34,166 --> 01:35:35,291
Someone must have told them.

951
01:35:35,332 --> 01:35:36,457
Leave from there immediately.

952
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:43,332
Nicky, I won't be able
to escape so easily from here.

953
01:35:44,666 --> 01:35:47,416
You get at the Desmony Gas station.
I'll meet you there.

954
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:48,666
You promise?

955
01:35:49,166 --> 01:35:50,208
I'll be there. You go.

956
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:52,125
I'm telling you, please. Trust me.

957
01:35:52,375 --> 01:35:53,291
Promise me.

958
01:35:54,541 --> 01:35:57,291
Okay, promise. You go. I'll be there.

959
01:37:28,291 --> 01:37:30,208
God damn it. Hold your fire.

960
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:24,875
"During the winter,
at dawn, my beloved.."

961
01:40:25,625 --> 01:40:34,332
"..I would have fresh
feelings about you."

962
01:40:36,041 --> 01:40:44,875
"O my dear, the special present
you gave me became my death.."

963
01:40:48,291 --> 01:40:54,750
"During the winter,
at dawn, my beloved.."

964
01:40:57,416 --> 01:41:04,166
"..I would have fresh
feelings about you."

965
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:14,832
"O my dear, the special present
you gave me became my death.."

966
01:41:15,082 --> 01:41:20,790
"..I keep it close to.."

967
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:27,750
"I keep your scarf close to my heart."

968
01:41:27,916 --> 01:41:34,208
"I keep your scarf close to my heart."

969
01:41:34,291 --> 01:41:41,125
"I keep your scarf close to my heart."

970
01:41:43,832 --> 01:41:50,582
"My heart keeps pounding
thinking of you."

971
01:41:50,666 --> 01:41:56,958
"How do I tell you how
my days go by in sorrow?"

972
01:41:59,875 --> 01:42:06,291
"My heart keeps pounding
thinking of you."

973
01:42:07,041 --> 01:42:12,625
"How do I tell you how
my days go by in sorrow?"

974
01:42:13,125 --> 01:42:16,291
"O my dear, you left me in darkness.."

975
01:42:16,625 --> 01:42:22,500
"O my dear,
you left me in darkness to be afraid."

976
01:42:23,832 --> 01:42:30,207
"I keep your scarf close to my heart."

977
01:42:30,291 --> 01:42:36,583
"I keep your scarf close to my heart."

978
01:42:36,666 --> 01:42:42,958
"I keep your scarf close to my heart."

979
01:43:02,832 --> 01:43:04,332
Shinda didn't come.

980
01:43:06,166 --> 01:43:07,625
He broke his promise.

981
01:43:08,957 --> 01:43:10,625
He was a liar.

982
01:43:18,375 --> 01:43:19,707
Sorry, Jasmine.

983
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:23,083
Wonder what all I accused you of.

984
01:43:24,457 --> 01:43:26,625
You are right at your part.

985
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:31,416
I agree with you.

986
01:43:31,707 --> 01:43:35,290
If you testify your truth
at the court this Wednesday...

987
01:43:35,916 --> 01:43:37,541
then I will handle everything.

988
01:43:38,291 --> 01:43:40,083
No charges will be pressed on you.

989
01:43:40,166 --> 01:43:43,500
After that, Ekom will be released.

990
01:43:43,582 --> 01:43:45,415
And that's my promise.

991
01:43:46,375 --> 01:43:50,291
I have decided.
I will do everything for him.

992
01:44:09,957 --> 01:44:15,082
"I will state the truth
in front of the judge."

993
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:22,082
"I think tomorrow the judgment
will be based on your statement."

994
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:28,250
"This will prove that I am innocent."

995
01:44:28,332 --> 01:44:34,207
"Your testimony on
Wednesday will release him."

996
01:44:34,541 --> 01:44:41,333
"Your testimony on
Wednesday will release him."

997
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:47,207
"Your testimony on
Wednesday will release him."

998
01:44:59,166 --> 01:45:05,291
"Tomorrow I will hold your
hand publicly and solve all problems."

999
01:45:05,375 --> 01:45:11,082
"I will burn fire-crackers in joy."

1000
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:17,416
"I find it amusing,
how this happened."

1001
01:45:17,625 --> 01:45:23,416
"Your testimony on
Wednesday will release him."

1002
01:45:23,707 --> 01:45:31,040
"Your testimony on
Wednesday will release him."

1003
01:45:31,416 --> 01:45:36,500
"Your testimony on
Wednesday will release him."

1004
01:46:26,375 --> 01:46:27,707
Please be seated.

1005
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:34,041
On advocate Jatala's suggestion...

1006
01:46:34,125 --> 01:46:37,291
Nicky gathered
courage and testified.

1007
01:46:38,375 --> 01:46:42,291
Whatever happened that day
and how Shinda died in front of her...

1008
01:46:42,582 --> 01:46:45,540
she repeated that entire incident.

1009
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:50,541
Even aunt testified that
Ekom is really Ekom and not Shinda.

1010
01:46:50,750 --> 01:46:53,916
That only Ekom's
face resembles Chinda...

1011
01:46:54,125 --> 01:46:55,457
and not his personality.

1012
01:46:56,416 --> 01:47:00,583
Sergeant Sandhu vouched on
his experience of so many years...

1013
01:47:00,832 --> 01:47:02,625
and assured the court...

1014
01:47:02,707 --> 01:47:05,040
that he is Ekom and not Shinda.

1015
01:47:05,625 --> 01:47:09,000
Advocate Jatala broke all
limits of his recommendations...

1016
01:47:09,166 --> 01:47:12,500
he did his best and
was true to his reputation...

1017
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:15,207
and left the verdict to the court.

1018
01:47:32,875 --> 01:47:37,166
The court found Ekom
innocent and released him.

1019
01:47:37,332 --> 01:47:40,500
And said, welcome to America.

1020
01:47:45,666 --> 01:47:49,000
Thank you, Mr. Jatala.
I owe you my life.

1021
01:47:49,250 --> 01:47:51,207
There's nothing to owe me.

1022
01:47:51,582 --> 01:47:54,540
If I can't be of any
help to my countrymen...

1023
01:47:55,041 --> 01:47:56,875
then what's the use of my position?

1024
01:47:58,791 --> 01:48:01,166
Thank you, Mr.
Jasbir. You helped me so much.

1025
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:03,541
Why are you thanking me?
That was my duty.

1026
01:48:04,375 --> 01:48:08,416
Okay, good luck.
If you need anything, call me.

1027
01:48:08,457 --> 01:48:10,125
-Thank you.
-Take care.

1028
01:48:11,416 --> 01:48:12,208
Bye.

1029
01:48:23,582 --> 01:48:26,582
Often when we think
that the story is over...

1030
01:48:26,916 --> 01:48:29,416
the story actually
starts from there.

1031
01:50:17,957 --> 01:50:21,290
Whether the enemies are in
front of you or across the globe...

1032
01:50:21,457 --> 01:50:24,290
revenge knows no boundaries.

1033
01:50:30,041 --> 01:50:33,500
Brother Shinda, come I'll
teach you how to take a selfie.

1034
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:35,582
Teach her.
What will I do after learning?

1035
01:50:35,666 --> 01:50:37,708
Just get here. When I'm not around...

1036
01:50:37,791 --> 01:50:39,791
you'll look at
my photos and miss me.

1037
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,207
What will I do with the
pictures of an idiot like you?

1038
01:50:42,291 --> 01:50:46,041
Come on. Stand behind.
Smile. One, two, three.

1039
01:50:46,457 --> 01:50:48,832
-At least pose.
-How?

1040
01:50:48,916 --> 01:50:49,541
Smile.

1041
01:50:50,832 --> 01:50:53,665
Bigger smile. Bigger smile.

1042
01:50:53,916 --> 01:50:56,000
Yes, that's good.

1043
01:50:56,125 --> 01:50:58,082
There is no one
greater than my Shinda.

1044
01:51:10,666 --> 01:51:15,375
Forgive me it took so long, brother.

1045
01:51:15,791 --> 01:51:18,416
But don't think that
I forgot about it.

1046
01:51:19,207 --> 01:51:21,500
I will take revenge for you.

1047
01:51:39,541 --> 01:51:40,708
Hello.

1048
01:51:46,541 --> 01:51:47,750
Captain.

1049
01:51:51,957 --> 01:51:53,457
Shinda, you have a great voice.

1050
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:55,291
As soon as you begin speaking,
I know it's you.

1051
01:51:57,041 --> 01:51:59,041
I knew you would remember me.

1052
01:52:00,541 --> 01:52:03,458
I could never forget
about you after Sunny's death.

1053
01:52:03,916 --> 01:52:05,583
I think of you every moment.

1054
01:52:13,375 --> 01:52:15,416
Good. Very good.

1055
01:52:16,416 --> 01:52:18,083
I tried to shoot you the other day.

1056
01:52:19,375 --> 01:52:20,457
But Sunny got shot.

1057
01:52:23,457 --> 01:52:25,207
You know why?

1058
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,957
Because you will die directly by me.

1059
01:52:29,207 --> 01:52:31,790
Don't waste your energy
over the phone, captain.

1060
01:52:32,457 --> 01:52:36,000
Save it. It'll be useful in the fight.

1061
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:38,416
You must have heard
the old saying that...

1062
01:52:39,291 --> 01:52:43,416
when a jackal has to die,
he runs towards the city.

1063
01:52:46,875 --> 01:52:49,541
Whether you die or I do...

1064
01:52:49,916 --> 01:52:54,583
this last fight should be amazing.

1065
01:52:55,416 --> 01:52:56,458
Tell me...

1066
01:52:58,457 --> 01:52:59,500
wherever I have to come.

1067
01:53:00,041 --> 01:53:03,041
Apple Valley. Sunday at 11.

1068
01:53:05,125 --> 01:53:06,082
I'll be there.

1069
01:53:07,291 --> 01:53:08,333
Done.

1070
01:53:09,457 --> 01:53:13,375
And listen, tell your family...

1071
01:53:14,332 --> 01:53:15,790
that you won't be coming back.

1072
01:53:24,166 --> 01:53:26,000
I have already gone, Captain.

1073
01:53:26,207 --> 01:53:28,415
You must bring your family along.

1074
01:53:28,916 --> 01:53:31,583
When you'll be dead...

1075
01:53:31,791 --> 01:53:33,916
you need someone to be with you.

1076
01:53:55,082 --> 01:53:56,040
Hello.

1077
01:53:56,541 --> 01:53:58,708
-Hello.
-Hello, who's this?

1078
01:53:58,791 --> 01:54:01,541
This is Karanvir Jatala.
Ekom's teacher.

1079
01:54:02,916 --> 01:54:04,875
Usha ma'am is busy at the rehearsal.

1080
01:54:04,957 --> 01:54:06,415
Please call back later.

1081
01:54:06,541 --> 01:54:08,416
This isn't Mrs. Mahendar's number?

1082
01:54:08,457 --> 01:54:11,000
No, no. This is Mrs. Usha's number.

1083
01:54:11,082 --> 01:54:12,915
She's an actor.
She's an amazing artist.

1084
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,250
Please call back later.

1085
01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:17,166
Okay.

1086
01:54:27,207 --> 01:54:29,582
-Where is Shinda?
-He is waiting for you.

1087
01:54:29,791 --> 01:54:33,958
Karanvir Jatala realized
that Ekom is Shinda.

1088
01:54:34,875 --> 01:54:36,791
There were many
questions in his heart...

1089
01:54:37,457 --> 01:54:39,332
for which he wanted answers.

1090
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:43,125
If Shinda is in front of me...

1091
01:54:43,207 --> 01:54:46,207
then who was the
man who died in the blast?

1092
01:54:46,916 --> 01:54:49,375
That day,
when we went to the gas station...

1093
01:54:51,416 --> 01:54:52,250
Yeah.

1094
01:54:54,250 --> 01:54:55,541
Hey, is it Captain?

1095
01:54:55,707 --> 01:54:56,207
Yes, Frank.

1096
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:58,707
White Hall farm.
9 street. Malibu beach.

1097
01:54:58,791 --> 01:55:00,583
Send your man before
the police gets that.

1098
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:12,250
Michael, I have a job for you.

1099
01:55:26,375 --> 01:55:29,500
Nicky, freshen up.

1100
01:55:32,125 --> 01:55:33,041
Okay.

1101
01:56:30,625 --> 01:56:31,707
Captain?

1102
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,125
If Captain knows I'm here...

1103
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:37,416
surely the police know too.

1104
01:56:41,582 --> 01:56:42,625
Nicky...

1105
01:56:44,166 --> 01:56:45,375
take the car out.

1106
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,416
Quickly. Quick.

1107
01:58:36,916 --> 01:58:39,166
That contract killer was Mexican.

1108
01:58:40,457 --> 01:58:43,665
I thought that even he
didn't have his blood identity...

1109
01:58:43,750 --> 01:58:45,582
with American Government like me.

1110
01:58:46,250 --> 01:58:49,791
I put my wristband on his hand...

1111
01:58:50,207 --> 01:58:55,582
and the American Government
thought that burnt body was Shinda's.

1112
01:58:55,916 --> 01:58:59,958
After that I went back
to India through Mexico.

1113
01:59:00,791 --> 01:59:03,166
What is this funda
about left and right?

1114
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,332
After going to India,
for about six months...

1115
01:59:07,457 --> 01:59:09,582
I kept my right hand plastered.

1116
01:59:09,791 --> 01:59:12,416
And did all my work with my left hand.

1117
01:59:12,707 --> 01:59:15,457
I had all my tattoos removed as well.

1118
01:59:15,791 --> 01:59:16,708
Good.

1119
01:59:17,082 --> 01:59:18,957
If you had gone back to India...

1120
01:59:19,041 --> 01:59:21,333
then why did you
come back to death again?

1121
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:27,541
Mr. Jatala, everything isn't
done just to protect your life.

1122
01:59:28,125 --> 01:59:30,916
Some things are done
to protect life and live it.

1123
01:59:31,707 --> 01:59:33,290
I didn't get you.

1124
01:59:36,707 --> 01:59:38,790
I loved Sunny more than my life.

1125
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:43,332
That day, when he was shot...

1126
01:59:59,207 --> 02:00:00,625
Brother Shinda...

1127
02:00:04,125 --> 02:00:05,750
Nothing will happen to you.

1128
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:23,625
Brother Shinda...

1129
02:00:23,707 --> 02:00:26,125
I and Nicky took Sunny with us.

1130
02:00:27,207 --> 02:00:29,000
But Los Angeles was very far.

1131
02:00:31,416 --> 02:00:34,291
Sunny's condition was getting worse.

1132
02:00:34,750 --> 02:00:37,041
It was very difficult
for us to get to LA.

1133
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,500
And a gas station came on the way...

1134
02:00:56,791 --> 02:00:59,875
where we stopped
to get bandage for him.

1135
02:01:02,875 --> 02:01:04,041
We have reached.

1136
02:01:07,166 --> 02:01:09,208
Nicky, be quick.

1137
02:01:21,625 --> 02:01:25,416
Brother Shinda. Shinda...

1138
02:01:26,666 --> 02:01:28,291
his aim was good.

1139
02:01:28,375 --> 02:01:32,207
Nothing will happen to you.

1140
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:35,291
-Here's your bandage.
-Some more.

1141
02:01:36,082 --> 02:01:37,125
Some more.

1142
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,541
No, brother, I won't make it.

1143
02:01:43,666 --> 02:01:46,166
-I don't regret dying.
-No.

1144
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:51,541
Because I'm dying in
my brother Shinda's arms.

1145
02:01:52,166 --> 02:01:54,375
-I'm happy.
-Don't say that.

1146
02:01:54,416 --> 02:01:56,500
I'm telling you,
everything will be fine.

1147
02:01:57,832 --> 02:01:58,707
How much? - $20.

1148
02:01:58,791 --> 02:01:59,875
Kindly add this.

1149
02:02:02,582 --> 02:02:05,540
But I regret that I'm
leaving a brother like you.

1150
02:02:06,166 --> 02:02:08,208
You're not going anywhere.

1151
02:02:08,416 --> 02:02:11,500
Now you have to dance at my wedding.

1152
02:02:11,957 --> 02:02:14,540
You have to play with my children.

1153
02:02:15,207 --> 02:02:18,165
You have to fulfill my dream.
About the fields.

1154
02:02:24,625 --> 02:02:26,916
I was enjoying living life now.

1155
02:02:28,832 --> 02:02:30,290
I don't want to die.

1156
02:02:33,875 --> 02:02:36,375
And that Captain
shattered all our dreams.

1157
02:02:41,791 --> 02:02:46,208
-Do one thing.
-Yes.

1158
02:02:48,625 --> 02:02:49,957
Don't spare him.

1159
02:02:51,541 --> 02:02:53,041
We will not spare him.

1160
02:02:53,332 --> 02:02:57,750
-We both will go together.
-No.

1161
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,457
You will kill him alone.

1162
02:03:00,541 --> 02:03:02,958
You will take revenge
for your younger brother.

1163
02:03:05,416 --> 02:03:08,041
I will watch you taking
revenge from up there.

1164
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:10,250
Sunny. Sunny.

1165
02:03:10,332 --> 02:03:12,875
Sunny. Sunny.

1166
02:03:13,207 --> 02:03:14,665
Sunny. Sunny.

1167
02:03:16,041 --> 02:03:17,375
Sunny.

1168
02:03:20,207 --> 02:03:21,375
Sunny.

1169
02:04:33,791 --> 02:04:35,750
We were not born from the same womb...

1170
02:04:36,832 --> 02:04:39,415
but we had that same
blood running in out veins.

1171
02:04:40,750 --> 02:04:44,375
Your last breathes are accountable...

1172
02:04:45,416 --> 02:04:49,041
and I will take away
Captain's every breath.

1173
02:04:50,375 --> 02:04:54,500
I swear on you.
I will kill him right here.

1174
02:04:59,332 --> 02:05:02,165
Why did you choose me for this case...

1175
02:05:02,875 --> 02:05:05,000
instead of all
the lawyers in the city?

1176
02:05:05,707 --> 02:05:07,790
We went through your entire career.

1177
02:05:07,916 --> 02:05:09,500
You have given more
importance to justice...

1178
02:05:09,582 --> 02:05:11,000
than to advocacy.

1179
02:05:11,291 --> 02:05:14,041
We couldn't find
anyone better than you.

1180
02:05:14,666 --> 02:05:16,916
It was our good luck
you didn't guess it.

1181
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:20,832
We agree that out ways were wrong,
but not our intentions.

1182
02:05:22,875 --> 02:05:25,791
Life had brought us to a place...

1183
02:05:26,041 --> 02:05:28,458
where all the doors close.

1184
02:05:34,375 --> 02:05:37,750
At first, even after winning the case,
I felt like I lost.

1185
02:05:39,166 --> 02:05:42,458
But now I feel a bigger victory.

1186
02:05:47,666 --> 02:05:49,458
Good luck for the future.

1187
02:06:02,082 --> 02:06:05,415
"Cover everything."

1188
02:06:05,457 --> 02:06:09,415
"See the blood shedding from my eyes."

1189
02:06:11,375 --> 02:06:18,457
"Inform all the enemies."

1190
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:26,666
"My blood rushes to take
revenge for everything."

1191
02:06:27,082 --> 02:06:32,790
"My blood rushes to take
revenge for everything."

1192
02:06:32,875 --> 02:06:39,041
"My blood rushes to take
revenge for everything."

1193
02:06:51,375 --> 02:06:53,832
"The hands which were
raised for killing.."

1194
02:06:53,916 --> 02:06:57,458
"..I will break them."

1195
02:06:57,875 --> 02:07:03,582
"His mouth did not
tire calling me brother."

1196
02:07:04,082 --> 02:07:10,040
"Only you can solve my problems."

1197
02:07:12,875 --> 02:07:19,000
"My blood rushes to take
revenge for everything."

1198
02:07:19,457 --> 02:07:25,082
"My blood rushes to take
revenge for everything."

1199
02:07:25,250 --> 02:07:31,250
"My blood rushes to take
revenge for everything."

1200
02:08:07,875 --> 02:08:10,166
Take, son.
Hot flatbreads made by your aunt.

1201
02:08:10,250 --> 02:08:12,041
Give me, aunt.

1202
02:08:12,207 --> 02:08:15,915
Mummy, now brother won't
be eating your food anymore.

1203
02:08:16,250 --> 02:08:18,500
What happened?
You don't like my food anymore?

1204
02:08:18,582 --> 02:08:20,665
Aunt, he's just joking.

1205
02:08:21,666 --> 02:08:23,125
Brother is in love...

1206
02:08:23,457 --> 02:08:25,165
now make arrangements
for his wedding.

1207
02:08:26,832 --> 02:08:29,332
Really? But you didn't
introduce me to the girl.

1208
02:08:29,541 --> 02:08:32,041
No. Hold this, aunt. I'll...

1209
02:08:32,625 --> 02:08:34,791
You're talking nonsense, you dog!

1210
02:08:34,875 --> 02:08:36,541
No! No, brother. No! Enough.

1211
02:08:54,332 --> 02:08:55,540
Ekom.

1212
02:09:06,750 --> 02:09:07,750
Aunt.

1213
02:09:11,707 --> 02:09:12,625
Aunt.

1214
02:09:13,207 --> 02:09:14,250
Shinda.

1215
02:09:26,916 --> 02:09:28,375
Get lost...

1216
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,791
You should have told mummy
that only her name is Nicky.

1217
02:09:32,207 --> 02:09:33,332
She is a bomb.

1218
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:36,625
She has driven my brother crazy.

1219
02:09:37,500 --> 02:09:41,916
No, buddy.
She doesn't have anyone except me.

1220
02:09:43,250 --> 02:09:45,291
Mother and father
left her and went away...

1221
02:09:45,832 --> 02:09:49,832
and you know the relatives
very well... who supports you?

1222
02:09:50,916 --> 02:09:52,375
But she is very nice.

1223
02:09:54,166 --> 02:09:56,541
My brother Shinda also
cannot be got just like that.

1224
02:09:58,291 --> 02:10:01,250
We must have done some good deeds in...

1225
02:10:01,707 --> 02:10:03,790
our previous lives
that we found each other.

1226
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:08,166
Brother Shinda...

1227
02:10:09,457 --> 02:10:11,582
we weren't born from the same womb...

1228
02:10:13,041 --> 02:10:15,166
but I love you a lot.

1229
02:10:15,957 --> 02:10:17,500
You're my life, brother.

1230
02:10:18,207 --> 02:10:21,250
When you're around,
nobody can even touch me.

1231
02:10:21,750 --> 02:10:24,625
If anyone does,
I will take his life away.

1232
02:12:53,791 --> 02:12:56,875
I guess, let's not waste time.

1233
02:12:59,332 --> 02:13:00,832
You are in such a rush to die?

1234
02:13:01,875 --> 02:13:04,625
Captain doesn't rush to die,
but to kill.

1235
02:13:04,707 --> 02:13:06,625
I will clear this
delusion of yours today.

1236
02:13:07,375 --> 02:13:10,541
Captain is that lion,
who always roars.

1237
02:13:10,625 --> 02:13:13,457
You don't become a tiger
by having long nails, Captain.

1238
02:13:13,875 --> 02:13:15,791
You have to hunt with bravery.

1239
02:13:16,625 --> 02:13:18,875
Shinda has learnt one thing in life...

1240
02:13:19,375 --> 02:13:23,250
I don't start anything fight,
but I don't spare anyone who has.

1241
02:13:23,916 --> 02:13:25,541
You have a lot of grudge against me.

1242
02:13:25,791 --> 02:13:30,625
I had told you before
that Shinda lives king-size.

1243
02:13:30,832 --> 02:13:36,290
Whatever he does is in double,
whether love or enmity.

1244
02:13:36,541 --> 02:13:38,291
Who is used to winning...

1245
02:13:38,375 --> 02:13:40,791
he can go to any extent to win.

1246
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:44,707
Many thieves, dacoits,
and politicians put together...

1247
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,707
and when you join
dogs and horses.

1248
02:13:46,791 --> 02:13:48,416
Then Captain is made.

1249
02:14:00,416 --> 02:14:01,916
You have the strength.

1250
02:14:02,791 --> 02:14:04,791
But you don't have
the mind like Captain does.

1251
02:14:05,332 --> 02:14:07,375
If you need to control
a crazy horse...

1252
02:14:07,457 --> 02:14:09,290
you need to run by its side,
captain.

1253
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:12,457
If you come in front of it,
it will run over you.

1254
02:14:15,332 --> 02:14:18,207
That's it. Enough of the trash talk.

1255
02:14:18,541 --> 02:14:20,208
Remember Sunny Singh.

1256
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:22,250
Be ready to go to your brother.

1257
02:14:22,791 --> 02:14:24,541
Remember this, Captain.

1258
02:14:25,332 --> 02:14:30,540
Whether the sun rises from
behind the mountains or rocks...

1259
02:14:31,207 --> 02:14:33,582
the sun is always the sun.

1260
02:14:58,791 --> 02:15:01,041
Come on. Come on.

1261
02:15:13,666 --> 02:15:15,791
We will kill him together.

1262
02:15:16,832 --> 02:15:18,332
You will kill him alone.

1263
02:15:18,791 --> 02:15:20,750
You will take revenge
for your brother.

1264
02:15:23,207 --> 02:15:25,915
I will watch you taking
revenge from up there.

1265
02:15:27,207 --> 02:15:29,957
Neither Ekom, nor Shinda.

1266
02:15:31,166 --> 02:15:32,791
Now a brother will fight.

1267
02:16:16,666 --> 02:16:19,750
Just naming yourself Captain
doesn't make you a captain.

1268
02:18:02,875 --> 02:18:08,208
They say that when dogs bark,
they must be killed.

1269
02:18:37,415 --> 02:18:40,457
I told you that you
do have the strength...

1270
02:18:41,208 --> 02:18:42,916
but not the mind that Captain has.

1271
02:19:58,415 --> 02:20:02,540
"Run away, my friend... on a carriage."

1272
02:21:03,250 --> 02:21:05,040
You were right, Captain.

1273
02:21:05,915 --> 02:21:08,040
It's great fun to kill someone.

1274
02:21:18,875 --> 02:21:22,958
'I swear on you.
I will kill him right here.'

1275
02:21:56,665 --> 02:22:00,332
'Tell me,
which beautiful dream did you see?'

1276
02:22:00,708 --> 02:22:01,500
'I?'

1277
02:22:02,875 --> 02:22:06,500
'I am riding a tractor in the fields.'

1278
02:22:08,500 --> 02:22:11,500
'There is a girl named
Nicky sitting on the tractor.'

1279
02:22:11,750 --> 02:22:13,875
'There is smoke coming
from the silencer..'

1280
02:22:13,958 --> 02:22:17,000
'..and the tractor
is making weird noises.'

1281
02:22:19,833 --> 02:22:21,958
'Brother,
what kind of a dream is this?'

1282
02:22:22,250 --> 02:22:28,540
'Listen. Idiot,
behind the tractor there were ants.'

1283
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:35,708
'And Nicky's hair and veil
is flying with the breeze.'

1284
02:22:36,708 --> 02:22:40,250
'Only you and Nicky
are in this dream.'

1285
02:22:41,165 --> 02:22:42,750
'You've cut my scene.'

1286
02:22:45,165 --> 02:22:46,957
'Idiot, look.'

1287
02:22:47,250 --> 02:22:50,540
Sunny, dear. Take tea for your father.

1288
02:22:51,165 --> 02:22:56,582
'The one bringing the tea in an urn...
that's you.'

1289
02:22:58,750 --> 02:23:01,165
'Really?
You both will have tea together.'

1290
02:23:03,540 --> 02:23:05,957
'Even in your dreams you have tea.'

1291
02:23:41,540 --> 02:23:45,750
"Father is happy,
have returned the loan."

1292
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:52,665
"I have some collected with me."

1293
02:23:52,750 --> 02:23:58,415
"If I become happy,
I will tell you something."

1294
02:23:58,500 --> 02:24:01,250
"The harvest is good, my beloved."

1295
02:24:01,290 --> 02:24:04,165
"I will get you a diamond nose-ring."

1296
02:24:04,250 --> 02:24:06,958
"The harvest is good, my beloved."

1297
02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:10,375
"I will get you a diamond nose-ring."

1298
02:24:18,500 --> 02:24:22,665
"I will get ready and go with you."

1299
02:24:22,750 --> 02:24:28,500
"I will go to the market with you."

1300
02:24:28,583 --> 02:24:31,625
"I will get ready and go with you."

1301
02:24:31,708 --> 02:24:35,541
"I will go to the market with you."

1302
02:24:35,625 --> 02:24:38,375
"I will get you a nice veil."

1303
02:24:38,458 --> 02:24:41,250
"I will get you a satin dress."

1304
02:24:41,290 --> 02:24:44,125
"The harvest is good, my beloved."

1305
02:24:44,208 --> 02:24:47,000
"I will get you a diamond nose-ring."

1306
02:24:47,125 --> 02:24:49,790
"The harvest is good, my beloved."

1307
02:24:49,875 --> 02:24:54,583
"I will get you a diamond nose-ring."

1308
02:25:05,290 --> 02:25:10,207
"The seeds that we still plough."

1309
02:25:10,290 --> 02:25:15,290
"They are still waiting."

1310
02:25:15,458 --> 02:25:18,750
"The seeds that we still plough."

1311
02:25:18,833 --> 02:25:22,708
"They are still waiting."

1312
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:25,415
"Now is time to enjoy."

1313
02:25:25,500 --> 02:25:28,375
"We have lived miserly for long."

1314
02:25:28,458 --> 02:25:31,250
"The harvest is good, my beloved."

1315
02:25:31,290 --> 02:25:35,790
"I will get you a diamond nose-ring."
