1
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:35,110
Come on friends,
win two times in one go!

2
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,573
You have lost again!

3
00:00:37,277 --> 00:00:42,393
Come on, play again,
you will win double!

4
00:00:42,473 --> 00:00:44,549
Oh! You have lost this one too!

5
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:48,823
Do you have more?
- Why are you spoiling the child?

6
00:00:48,996 --> 00:00:51,019
Hey! Old man. 
Why are you ruining my business?

7
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:53,158
Get lost!

8
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:56,648
Hey! Why are you hitting him?

9
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:05,231
Hey! Why did you hit him?

10
00:01:05,428 --> 00:01:06,660
Hey! Whose kid is he?

11
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,051
You go to school! 

12
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:11,031
You can watch
an old man being thrashed?

13
00:01:11,163 --> 00:01:14,475
But, I cannot see it!
-Will you give him justice?

14
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:15,370
Get away!

15
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:23,831
Go away...and what are
you all seeing, go away!

16
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:26,136
Go away.

17
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,163
Go.

18
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:31,771
Go.

19
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:58,166
What have you got, Shankar?
- Sir, my mother has sent rice.

20
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:01,214
That's all? Keep it aside!

21
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,433
Hey, Rahim!
- Yes, sir?

22
00:02:04,603 --> 00:02:07,949
Wasn't your father supposed to
get sugar and butter for me?

23
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:10,534
My father is ill, sir.
- But, he isn't dead!

24
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:11,756
Master!
- Shut up!

25
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,090
Help!

26
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,877
I'll teach you a lesson.
- Don't hit me, sir!

27
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:31,126
Uncle, please don't sell me,
please stop them!

28
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:34,484
My mother made you
my guardian, please help me!

29
00:02:34,836 --> 00:02:37,633
Leave me, you rascal!

30
00:02:37,713 --> 00:02:43,674
Don't act smart, I am Mamia Bhangetevas.
I am not taking you for free!

31
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,025
I have paid money to your uncle, 
come on!

32
00:02:47,105 --> 00:02:48,824
No, I will not!

33
00:02:50,284 --> 00:02:51,689
Leave me!

34
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:54,135
Leave me!

35
00:02:54,405 --> 00:02:56,273
Leave me!
- Nobody will save you.

36
00:02:56,353 --> 00:02:57,935
I'll not go.

37
00:02:58,128 --> 00:03:00,489
Please leave me for God's sake!

38
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:03,593
Leave her, you rascals!

39
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:08,441
Don't you dare come in our way!

40
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:23,573
Hey! What are you doing?

41
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,920
Hey! Which jerk dared to call me out?

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,125
Who is it?
-It's me!

43
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:37,554
Go away from here!

44
00:03:38,391 --> 00:03:43,243
Is she your mother,
or your sister?

45
00:03:43,594 --> 00:03:45,125
Yes, she is. Leave her!

46
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:48,513
Ask these cowards here, who I am?
- Leave me!

47
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:53,220
I am Mamia Bhangetevas.
I can beat everyone here, single handed!

48
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:59,107
Go away from here 
or I will take away your sister too!

49
00:04:01,237 --> 00:04:03,500
Get lost, coward!!

50
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:09,494
Hey, look! He ran away!
The chicken ran away!

51
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:51,455
Who were those girls for whom you
fought such dangerous criminals?

52
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,574
How were they related to you?

53
00:06:53,654 --> 00:06:56,985
Mother, he must have thought
of them as his sisters.

54
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,203
Isn't it, brother?
- Shut up! You always side him.

55
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:05,457
Mother, instead of them,
if someone would drag my sister...

56
00:07:05,764 --> 00:07:07,584
...and nobody would come
forward to help her...

57
00:07:07,982 --> 00:07:09,258
...then what would she go through?

58
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:14,383
But if something would happen to you
then what would we go through?

59
00:07:15,293 --> 00:07:16,558
Have you ever thought of that?

60
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:21,295
I didn't think of anything
when I heard those hapless girls crying!

61
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,516
Mother, have faith in your son.

62
00:07:24,804 --> 00:07:27,485
Nothing will happen to me!

63
00:07:35,908 --> 00:07:42,286
"I've loved only you.
I've given my heart to you."

64
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:45,581
"No matter what happens.."
- Hi, baby.

65
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:52,783
Why did you slap me?
I did not tease you!

66
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:55,189
Then who teased me?
- He did!

67
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:57,719
You midget!

68
00:07:58,292 --> 00:07:59,484
You fool.

69
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:02,831
The day I lay my hands on you,
I will thrash you!

70
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,820
I don't mind, actually, we both would
have been married long back!

71
00:08:08,873 --> 00:08:12,086
And by now, you would have
a child as old as me!

72
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,889
You have been failing in the same
class since past 10 years...

73
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:18,243
I suggest that you
should leave studies...

74
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:20,747
at this age,
you won't even get a job anywhere.

75
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:24,293
I work for a girl, not for a job!

76
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:26,995
Who will marry you?
-Atleast, you will marry me!

77
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:31,117
Kiddo! First grow up!

78
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,348
What happened?
- Arjun...

79
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,035
you better talk
to your idiot friends...

80
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:35,999
they keep teasing us all the time!
- Arjun!

81
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:42,226
And this mosquito!
- Hey! Why do I get complains everyday?

82
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:47,712
Arjun, look there,
the Minister's lad is coming!

83
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:50,776
Hi, Pinky, Radha, Mona, Mukesh.
How are you?

84
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:57,175
How are you, Khulla Ramani?
And sir, how are you?

85
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,717
I am fine with your mercy!

86
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:02,872
Sure, be happy!

87
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:08,305
Rascal!...Let's go, Professor
Mistry must be taking attendance.

88
00:09:08,385 --> 00:09:09,804
Let's go.
- Yes, let's go!

89
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:11,845
Number 8?

90
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,413
Number 8?

91
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:15,230
Number 8?
- Sorry, sir.

92
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,170
It's you? I shake up seeing you.
Sit, dear.

93
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:25,972
Why do you come like imps in
the class, sit down quickly!

94
00:09:26,386 --> 00:09:27,467
Sit down!

95
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:31,927
What a classroom! Number 9?

96
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:33,792
I'm fine.

97
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:35,846
Number 10?

98
00:09:36,698 --> 00:09:38,603
Sleeping in the den.

99
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:44,594
Wake up! This ass was my classmate
and now he is my student.

100
00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:46,151
And yet he has not improved!

101
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:48,719
Number twelve?

102
00:09:51,314 --> 00:09:54,557
Please support me.
-I will die!

103
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,945
She utters nonsense.

104
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:59,160
Number thirteen.
- Beautiful teen!

105
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:00,500
I know it!

106
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:02,367
Number 14?

107
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:05,327
Number 14?

108
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:11,960
Sir, I am fourteen.
-Why don't you stand up and say?

109
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,406
Roll number 15?

110
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,230
Fifteen!

111
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:21,890
Where is roll number fifteen?
-She won't come that easily!

112
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:25,851
Because, roll number fifteen has
been upgraded to sixteen today.

113
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:27,022
Who is this roll number fifteen?

114
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:16,637
"I am sweet sixteen"

115
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:24,198
"I am hot as fire"

116
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,473
"I am sixteen, I am hot as fire,
I have come to inflame everyone"

117
00:11:33,553 --> 00:11:38,606
"I am sixteen, I am hot as fire,
I have come to inflame everyone"

118
00:11:38,686 --> 00:11:43,656
"Whoever has seen me, says..."

119
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:48,607
"I take away their senses"
- "I take away their senses"

120
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:51,437
"I am sweet sixteen"

121
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:56,110
"I am hot as fire"

122
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:41,237
"She is sixteen, she is hot,
she has come to inflame everyone"

123
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:48,324
"Whoever has seen her said,
she takes away senses"

124
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:16,870
"You all feel stifled inside..."

125
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:21,759
"come out and enjoy the weather"

126
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,392
"come out and enjoy the weather"

127
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:31,471
"The cheerful ones say..."
- "The cheerful ones say..."

128
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:36,209
"she will create a sensation"
- "she will create a sensation"

129
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:38,655
"I am sweet sixteen"

130
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,802
"I am hot as fire"

131
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:50,750
"I am sixteen, I am hot as fire,
I have come to inflame everyone"

132
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,278
"Whoever has seen me, says..."

133
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:55,719
"I take away their senses"

134
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:58,106
"I take away their senses"

135
00:13:58,186 --> 00:14:00,894
"I am sweet sixteen"

136
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,407
"I am hot as fire"

137
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:12,691
"Shut this college"

138
00:14:12,771 --> 00:14:17,357
"Shut .. "
- "this college"

139
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:22,218
"Dance, sing,
be merry and enjoy life"

140
00:14:22,298 --> 00:14:26,855
"Dance, sing, 
be merry and enjoy life"

141
00:14:26,935 --> 00:14:31,558
"Shut this college"

142
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:36,851
"Shut this college"

143
00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:43,853
Silence! In the honor
of my birthday today...

144
00:14:44,014 --> 00:14:46,303
everyone gets a treat
in the canteen.

145
00:14:49,109 --> 00:14:52,713
Eat whatever you want but,
in limit and especially you!

146
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:56,835
Hey, stingy! Being a Commissioner's
daughter, you are such a miser?

147
00:14:56,915 --> 00:14:58,916
I will eat a lot!

148
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,489
I may be the Commissioner's
daughter but, I am helpless...

149
00:15:01,656 --> 00:15:05,087
my father is not corrupt or,
I would treat you as much as you want!

150
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:06,570
Forget it, you are a miser!

151
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,454
Happy birthday!
- Cake is here.

152
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:09,738
Chocolate cake.

153
00:15:09,818 --> 00:15:11,924
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

154
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:15,246
Hey! You are really heartless.
-Why?

155
00:15:15,326 --> 00:15:20,880
Will you cut a heart?
- What do I do? Nobody takes my heart!

156
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,424
Okay, cut it.

157
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:26,936
Happy birthday to you!

158
00:15:27,016 --> 00:15:29,369
Happy birthday to you!

159
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:32,747
Happy birthday to Deepa.

160
00:15:32,827 --> 00:15:35,720
Happy birthday to you!

161
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:39,504
Deepa, whom will you give this
first piece of your heart?

162
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:42,497
Me!
-No, she will give it to me!

163
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:46,037
Forget it, Deepa,
you give this piece to me.

164
00:15:46,117 --> 00:15:48,337
No Deepa, give this piece to me.

165
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:49,963
Me.
- Me.

166
00:15:50,043 --> 00:15:51,918
Stop it!

167
00:15:52,146 --> 00:15:54,790
Let's do one thing,
you all keep your mouth open...

168
00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:56,520
and I will close my eyes and walk...

169
00:15:56,749 --> 00:16:00,775
whoever is destined will get
the first piece of my heart.

170
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:02,684
All right.

171
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:04,187
In line.

172
00:16:17,796 --> 00:16:22,171
Oh no. Why did you give a piece of your
heart to a man who can never love?

173
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:24,152
Radha.
- Sorry. - Ok.

174
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:28,993
I cannot help it!  Arjun,
I hope you will take care of my heart?

175
00:16:29,234 --> 00:16:31,253
I am not the kind to get
involved in such things.

176
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,254
But, I do get involved,
you give this piece to me!

177
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:35,286
Stop it, Pankaj.
- Stupid!

178
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:37,330
Stop fighting like kids!

179
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:41,295
Today is Deepa's birthday,
we have the whole day...

180
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,913
Let's freak out, let's have fun.

181
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:45,286
Let's go to see a film.

182
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:49,733
Forget films, come with me,
I will show you something rare!

183
00:16:49,813 --> 00:16:52,381
What?
-A well of fire!

184
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:04,710
Come my friends and witness
the most dangerous game...

185
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,181
Look.
- Watch this unique game.

186
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:12,907
Friends, this is not a mere game,
this is a game of people with guts.

187
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:17,161
Our fearless player will show
his marvels in a few minutes.

188
00:17:17,396 --> 00:17:21,847
He will light fire on his body
and jump in this water.

189
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,697
This world has many fearless players...

190
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:29,574
so, let's applaud for today's player.

191
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:34,726
Really?

192
00:17:58,252 --> 00:17:59,705
Look, Deepa.

193
00:18:28,699 --> 00:18:33,313
Hey! You charge 100 rupees ticket
for such a cheap item?

194
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:37,809
You are looting us?
You think we are fools?

195
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:40,030
It's this special dress
which protects this man!

196
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,066
Wearing this dress,
anyone can jump from a height.

197
00:18:42,146 --> 00:18:45,544
Even I can.
- Madam, women cannot play this game.

198
00:18:46,352 --> 00:18:49,604
And sir, if you are talking so
much then why don't you jump?

199
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:51,531
The company will give you
a very big reward.

200
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,936
Come on, go and jump!

201
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:58,263
Now you are scared?
Why did you talk so much?

202
00:18:58,343 --> 00:19:00,971
It's the company's challenge,
not a joke.

203
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:04,157
But, if you lose your life,
the company will not be responsible.

204
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:08,481
Only we have the person
who can do this stunt.

205
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:09,976
Nobody else can perform this act!

206
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:11,637
I will do it!

207
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,658
What happened?

208
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,736
Let's see.
- I don't think he will survive.

209
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:01,374
Is he dead?
- Is he dead?

210
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:16,435
We came to know of the story of
that guy who died the other day.

211
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:17,928
What happened? 

212
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,993
He promised
his girlfriend an expensive gift.

213
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:24,364
Is it? 
-What a man! He gave his life for his love!

214
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:25,682
Fatso!
- Hi, Arjun!

215
00:20:25,762 --> 00:20:27,950
Love is such!

216
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:34,060
I think a man who has never loved
or has no girlfriend is incomplete.

217
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,872
What is the connection in being
a man and having a girlfriend?

218
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:41,112
There is a connection.
When there is a girl in a man's life...

219
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:44,438
then his obsession and
strength is doubled.

220
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:49,305
And not only that, when this
same man falls weak in life...

221
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,909
his girlfriend gives him inspiration.

222
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:54,944
Do you know.

223
00:20:55,024 --> 00:20:59,707
A man who gets a woman who truly
loves him, is really very lucky!

224
00:20:59,787 --> 00:21:02,642
Someone like me!
-Enough, now let's go.

225
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:14,202
When there is a girl in a man's life,...

226
00:21:14,282 --> 00:21:16,981
his strength and obsession is doubled.

227
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,518
And not only that, 
when this man fall weak in life...

228
00:21:20,932 --> 00:21:24,479
his girlfriend gives him inspiration.

229
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:32,874
Arjun, will you take care
of this piece of my heart?

230
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:52,421
"Tell me, Radha.
Will we unite or not?"

231
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,438
Never!

232
00:21:54,518 --> 00:21:57,903
She doesn't listen,
but it will happen.

233
00:21:58,136 --> 00:22:00,653
Hey! What are you doing?

234
00:22:00,974 --> 00:22:03,293
How are you, chief?
- Where is Deepa?

235
00:22:03,576 --> 00:22:06,045
You too? There she is!

236
00:22:06,261 --> 00:22:08,508
Gold spot.
- Thumbs up.

237
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:11,261
Sir.
- Hi.

238
00:22:12,735 --> 00:22:14,695
Deepa.
- Hi, Arjun.

239
00:22:15,906 --> 00:22:18,047
I want to tell you
something important.

240
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:20,996
So, tell me.
-Not here, come there.

241
00:22:21,722 --> 00:22:23,141
Go!

242
00:22:31,431 --> 00:22:32,742
Now tell me what is it?

243
00:22:33,082 --> 00:22:35,762
Deepa, I have realized that...

244
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:39,623
What have you realized?
-I have realized that...

245
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:41,587
Will you only keep realizing
or will you speak further?

246
00:22:41,815 --> 00:22:43,367
I love you, Deepa.

247
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:49,271
Love!
-Yes Deepa, I love you!

248
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:50,969
But I don't love you.

249
00:22:51,225 --> 00:22:55,854
I know that not only you love me but,
you are crazy about me!

250
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:01,663
Who told you this?
-The first piece of your heart.

251
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,766
Which you gave only to me inspite of
the presence of several other boys.

252
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:09,761
My eyes were closed that is why,
that cake went in your mouth.

253
00:23:09,841 --> 00:23:14,205
I understand everything,
you wanted to surprise me.

254
00:23:14,678 --> 00:23:18,183
You think that when I will
get upset and go away...

255
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:21,186
then suddenly,
you will come running to me...

256
00:23:21,435 --> 00:23:27,126
and hug me, now tell me,
haven't I spoken your feelings?

257
00:23:27,381 --> 00:23:31,261
Have you gone mad?
-I have gone mad in your love.

258
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,436
Then I think I will have
to cure your madness.

259
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:37,531
Radha, Mukesh, Pankaj, Lambu come fast.
- Deepa, please.

260
00:23:37,611 --> 00:23:40,984
Come here everyone!
-What is it?

261
00:23:41,064 --> 00:23:43,671
Don't ridicule my love.

262
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:49,212
He says that...you tell them.
-Why don't you tell us?

263
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:52,442
He says that he loves me.

264
00:23:52,522 --> 00:23:56,843
Arjun and love?
- Forget it. You surely have misunderstood.

265
00:23:57,226 --> 00:24:02,480
He must have said something else!

266
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:09,667
Don't ever claim your love or you
will be thrashed by me. You bull!

267
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:15,038
Don't you dare call me a bull!
-I will, what will you do?

268
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:23,476
Mark my words, one day,
you will accept me in front of everyone.

269
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:24,902
Forget it.

270
00:24:24,982 --> 00:24:27,402
C'mon, baby.
- Love!

271
00:24:28,381 --> 00:24:29,902
C'mon.

272
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:38,419
Mukesh.

273
00:24:38,499 --> 00:24:43,543
What is the matter?
-My mother is very serious, Arjun.

274
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:48,544
If the operation is not done,
she will not live.

275
00:24:49,328 --> 00:24:53,245
The doctor has asked for seventy
thousand rupees for the operation.

276
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,240
Seventy thousand?
-Yes, Arjun.

277
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:03,275
You go to your mother,
I will try and make the arrangements.

278
00:25:14,168 --> 00:25:15,619
This is from me.

279
00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:28,184
Go ahead, college beggar!

280
00:25:28,456 --> 00:25:30,263
Watch your mouth, Pankaj.

281
00:25:33,455 --> 00:25:36,094
I should speak with respect with
people collecting bogus funds?

282
00:25:37,307 --> 00:25:41,479
It's really sad to see that strong
men like him have to resort to this!

283
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:42,598
Pankaj.

284
00:25:42,678 --> 00:25:45,595
People get angry on
hearing the truth!

285
00:25:45,972 --> 00:25:51,207
It's Mukesh's mother who is sick
then why are you in pain?

286
00:25:51,457 --> 00:25:55,313
Because, she is my mother too!

287
00:25:55,393 --> 00:26:00,646
Great! For the first time I've seen
someone begging for his mother!

288
00:26:01,086 --> 00:26:03,556
If you really consider
Mukesh's mother as your own...

289
00:26:03,957 --> 00:26:06,709
then why don't you jump in the
well of fire and save her life?

290
00:26:07,216 --> 00:26:09,919
I surely will save her!

291
00:26:22,952 --> 00:26:24,252
Arjun!

292
00:26:24,894 --> 00:26:26,755
Brother!
- Mother!

293
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,206
Son, what are you about to do?

294
00:26:29,286 --> 00:26:31,516
It is the question of
Mukesh's mother's life.

295
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:37,043
Do you think it is smart to give up
your life to save someone else's?

296
00:26:37,761 --> 00:26:41,576
People think with their head but,
your son listens to his heart.

297
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:43,356
No son, please come down.

298
00:26:43,495 --> 00:26:44,974
Yes brother, come down.

299
00:26:49,668 --> 00:26:53,532
Arjun, if something happens to you,
what will your old mother do?

300
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:57,646
Mother, the lady who is hospitalized
is also someone's mother!

301
00:26:58,032 --> 00:27:01,050
You care for everyone but,
you've forgotten your own mother?

302
00:27:01,326 --> 00:27:03,756
Every son lives for his mother...

303
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:09,001
but your son, is playing with his
life for someone else's mother.

304
00:27:09,903 --> 00:27:13,436
Bless me, mother.
-You want me to bless you to die?

305
00:27:13,653 --> 00:27:15,200
How can you be so heartless?

306
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,499
Stop being stubborn and
come down for my sake.

307
00:27:18,755 --> 00:27:20,975
Mother, if you insist,
I will come down...

308
00:27:21,626 --> 00:27:26,978
but if something happens to 
Mukesh's mother, will you be happy?

309
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:29,608
Answer me, mother!

310
00:28:23,753 --> 00:28:25,595
Thank you, Arjun.
- Mukesh.

311
00:28:27,537 --> 00:28:29,615
Thank you, Arjun.
Thank you very much.

312
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:35,815
You jumped into the well of death
to save my mother's life?

313
00:28:36,474 --> 00:28:37,509
Mukesh.

314
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:42,657
If you wouldn't endanger your life,
you know what the doctor would say?

315
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:44,571
I'm sorry.

316
00:28:44,651 --> 00:28:47,099
They would say that they
could not save my mother!

317
00:28:47,538 --> 00:28:50,140
And I would have become an orphan.

318
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:55,412
But, you saved my mother and
saved me from being an orphan.

319
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:03,841
Stop crying, Mukesh! No, Mukesh.

320
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:23,793
Arjun.

321
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,350
Hi, Arjun.

322
00:29:30,364 --> 00:29:31,800
Hi.

323
00:29:32,524 --> 00:29:33,673
What are you reading?

324
00:29:34,317 --> 00:29:35,482
Chemistry.

325
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:38,529
What does your chemistry
say about your heart?

326
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:41,631
Why do you want to know,
you don't have a heart!

327
00:29:41,777 --> 00:29:45,030
I do have! 
- I am sure it's a piece of cake.

328
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:49,017
I have a heart that beats
and do you know...

329
00:29:49,946 --> 00:29:54,539
whenever I see you,
something happens to me!

330
00:29:55,118 --> 00:30:00,884
Is it? 
-And when I sleep in the night then...

331
00:30:00,964 --> 00:30:04,543
I come in your dreams, right?
-Yes!

332
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:07,432
And in your sleep you must be
thinking that I am your pillow?

333
00:30:07,512 --> 00:30:08,851
Correct.

334
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,483
Which means, I am your pillow?
- Yes.

335
00:30:11,563 --> 00:30:14,976
You are saying yes!
-Why don't you understand?

336
00:30:15,893 --> 00:30:18,829
When someone comes into the bed,
like a pillow...

337
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:21,564
then you should understand
that the person is in love.

338
00:30:22,413 --> 00:30:27,338
What?
- I mean, I am in love with you!

339
00:30:27,674 --> 00:30:31,281
You mean love?
-Yes!

340
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:34,456
Listen friends, listen to the latest news!
- Stop it, Arjun.

341
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:37,927
What are you doing?
-The same that you did to me!

342
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:44,215
Love?! Everyone, come here!
- What happened?

343
00:30:47,098 --> 00:30:52,036
What happened, Arjun?
-Tell them, why are you quiet?

344
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,235
What happened, Arjun?

345
00:30:53,315 --> 00:30:56,828
You tell us. 
She says she is in love with me.

346
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:06,099
But, she has already rejected your love?

347
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,792
Exactly and now she is accepting it!

348
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,490
Come on, tell me in front of everyone!

349
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:14,092
"I am burning in fire of passion..."

350
00:32:14,535 --> 00:32:20,238
"I am burning in fire of passion..."

351
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:28,764
"like the dew of love,
douse the fire within me"

352
00:32:28,844 --> 00:32:35,990
"like the dew of love,
douse the fire within me"

353
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:43,506
"You will do a great favor on me"

354
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:49,008
"I am burning in fire of passion..."

355
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:31,570
"I have lost my senses,
I feel restless..."

356
00:33:34,734 --> 00:33:41,882
"I have lost my senses,
I feel restless..."

357
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:48,989
"a sweet pain now pierces my heart"

358
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:55,764
"We both are alone,
the ambience is perfect..."

359
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:02,957
"We both are alone,
the ambience is perfect..."

360
00:34:03,201 --> 00:34:10,096
"touch my lips,
let our breath mingle..."

361
00:34:10,453 --> 00:34:17,373
"you will do a great favor on me"

362
00:34:18,277 --> 00:34:23,217
"I am burning in fire of passion..."

363
00:34:25,558 --> 00:34:31,143
"I am burning in fire of passion..."

364
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:59,565
"You are my love, you are my life"

365
00:35:02,147 --> 00:35:09,334
"You are my love, you are my life"

366
00:35:09,414 --> 00:35:16,334
"Wherever you tread
becomes my destination"

367
00:35:16,534 --> 00:35:23,244
"I am crazy about you,
I worship you as my God"

368
00:35:23,738 --> 00:35:30,620
"I am crazy about you,
I worship you as my God"

369
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:37,642
"Abandon this world,
encircle me in your arms"

370
00:35:37,814 --> 00:35:44,696
"You will do a great favor on me"

371
00:35:45,965 --> 00:35:51,502
"I am burning in
the fire of passion"

372
00:36:08,905 --> 00:36:12,148
Hi, Dinky. Dear Dinky.

373
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:14,021
Hi, Dinky.

374
00:36:16,082 --> 00:36:18,481
How long will you keep running
away from me, dear Dinky?

375
00:36:19,173 --> 00:36:21,671
Just once, smile at me!

376
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:24,646
I don't mind even if you
vent out your venom on me!

377
00:36:25,237 --> 00:36:26,960
Get lost.

378
00:36:34,217 --> 00:36:36,472
You think you can run away from me?

379
00:36:37,219 --> 00:36:40,766
Mukesh, Pankaj is misbehaving
with Dinky in the toilet.

380
00:37:19,692 --> 00:37:22,628
Rascal, who are you to
interfere in my matters?

381
00:37:23,138 --> 00:37:25,688
Hello, police station.

382
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:40,952
I'll break your bones!

383
00:37:51,362 --> 00:37:53,934
What's happening here?
- Inspector, this boy...

384
00:37:54,014 --> 00:37:56,889
No  Inspector, this boy entered
the bathroom with this girl.

385
00:37:57,668 --> 00:37:59,826
I told him this is college and I'll
not let such things happen here!

386
00:38:00,098 --> 00:38:02,828
So he...look inspector,
how much he has hit me!

387
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:06,754
Sir, he is lying. No sir,
-she willingly went with him.

388
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:07,846
He is lying! 

389
00:38:08,231 --> 00:38:10,099
How dare you do such things
in the bathroom?

390
00:38:21,339 --> 00:38:25,166
If dare to do this again
then I will rip you apart!

391
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,458
Let's go, Mr. Pankaj.

392
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:36,612
Arjun, Pankaj has picked up
a fight in the college.

393
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,196
Inspector, now you have
to handle everything.

394
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:43,132
Don't worry sir,
this is my jurisdiction.

395
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,278
Drive the way you want.

396
00:38:55,163 --> 00:38:56,701
Mukesh. Mukesh.

397
00:38:57,622 --> 00:38:59,406
Someone please take him
to the hospital.

398
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,489
Hey! Get the tea quickly!
-Get it, sir.

399
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:07,652
Here it is.

400
00:39:08,122 --> 00:39:12,482
Sir, I have trapped Mukesh in the
police snare in such a way that...

401
00:39:12,562 --> 00:39:15,502
he will keep getting beaten up
if he tries to act smart!

402
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:21,658
If you sign this report, 
you can change his complete destiny!

403
00:39:32,211 --> 00:39:33,427
Pankaj!

404
00:41:18,813 --> 00:41:24,232
My child! What happened to you?
O God! Why did you do this?

405
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:28,212
What will a helpless mother
do without her son?

406
00:41:28,803 --> 00:41:32,350
Mukesh my child, how can I live?

407
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,455
Mukesh.

408
00:41:34,749 --> 00:41:38,060
Wait! Before you cover
the crime committed by law...

409
00:41:38,549 --> 00:41:43,342
let this officer of law see the
merciless and true picture of law!

410
00:41:43,422 --> 00:41:46,523
Child, who is this boy?

411
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:48,072
He...

412
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,572
He...father, he was a support
of an old mother!

413
00:41:54,892 --> 00:41:56,687
But, your law snatched him away!

414
00:41:56,767 --> 00:41:59,949
your inspector
killed him because...

415
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:04,476
he stopped a minister's son from
committing a filthy offense!

416
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,442
See how mercilessly he has
been killed, father.

417
00:42:10,219 --> 00:42:12,128
This poor boy died...

418
00:42:14,894 --> 00:42:18,146
and his aged mother
has become helpless.

419
00:42:19,388 --> 00:42:23,898
She is as good as dead.
Can your law return her son back?

420
00:42:24,303 --> 00:42:28,357
If you would have seen Mukesh's
condition, you too would get enraged.

421
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:31,725
Besides, Arjun just broke
that inspector's jaw.

422
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:35,105
How did Arjun go wrong,
answer me, father...

423
00:42:36,043 --> 00:42:38,375
why did your law handcuff him?

424
00:42:39,354 --> 00:42:41,821
And why was that cruel
inspector left scoot free?

425
00:42:42,242 --> 00:42:44,890
That man is a stigma
in the name of law!

426
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,895
It becomes very difficult
to confer justice...

427
00:42:47,508 --> 00:42:51,445
when an officer from our department
behaves in this manner!

428
00:42:52,246 --> 00:42:56,257
Arjun, it's very nice to know that
you fight to give justice to others.

429
00:42:57,618 --> 00:43:02,501
But to fight for other's justice,
you should adopt the right way.

430
00:43:03,517 --> 00:43:07,395
Our police force desperately
needs young men like you.

431
00:43:11,206 --> 00:43:12,925
Sir, you have given me
a very good advice.

432
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:18,255
I feel a new path has opened for me
and a new destination is ahead.

433
00:43:21,028 --> 00:43:28,450
You too will reach your destination
the way I have reached mine.

434
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:32,229
I beg your pardon.
-I am going to retire very soon.

435
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,774
Then I will shift to Mumbai,
where my house is.

436
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:40,833
But before that, it is imperative
that you become a police officer.

437
00:43:41,762 --> 00:43:43,080
Yes, sir.

438
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:04,856
Climb the ropes!

439
00:44:06,368 --> 00:44:08,057
Look ahead!

440
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,659
Climb!

441
00:44:27,744 --> 00:44:29,264
Bhaskar.

442
00:44:34,196 --> 00:44:35,504
Attention everyone!

443
00:44:37,828 --> 00:44:40,757
Arjun Singh, you too go
and line up there!

444
00:44:40,901 --> 00:44:43,902
He is very badly injured,
please let me take your jeep...

445
00:44:44,052 --> 00:44:45,911
and admit him in
the hospital immediately.

446
00:44:46,189 --> 00:44:48,523
The Government jeep is not
meant for such things!

447
00:44:48,756 --> 00:44:50,097
Someone call the ambulance.

448
00:44:50,177 --> 00:44:52,441
But sir, what if he dies before that?

449
00:44:52,827 --> 00:44:54,102
Then he will die!

450
00:44:54,398 --> 00:44:57,016
Ok. Now you don't try to teach me.

451
00:44:57,096 --> 00:44:59,304
Stand in your line, idiot.

452
00:44:59,384 --> 00:45:02,064
Sir, I will not let him die!

453
00:45:25,162 --> 00:45:30,656
Sorry young man, if you would get
him earlier, I could have saved him.

454
00:45:30,736 --> 00:45:32,417
No!!

455
00:46:43,486 --> 00:46:47,523
Arjun Singh, will you cool down?
Cool down.

456
00:46:50,834 --> 00:46:52,246
Mohite.
- Yes, sir.

457
00:46:52,326 --> 00:46:53,845
This matter is quite complicated.

458
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,427
That is why, I want to present this
case to the higher authorities.

459
00:46:59,895 --> 00:47:01,377
They will decide further.

460
00:47:02,514 --> 00:47:06,044
It could be possible that
Arjun Singh is punished.

461
00:47:06,956 --> 00:47:11,044
Or, it could even be that
only you get the punishment.

462
00:47:12,055 --> 00:47:14,510
There is no need for
any further decision, sir.

463
00:47:15,264 --> 00:47:17,713
I have learnt from my student,
Arjun Singh that...

464
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:23,319
a man is known not by his position
or pride but, by his qualities.

465
00:47:24,352 --> 00:47:25,687
I'm sorry, sir.

466
00:47:26,331 --> 00:47:27,581
I'm sorry, sir.

467
00:47:28,003 --> 00:47:30,797
A man learns when the time is right.

468
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:40,631
Mother! Someone is at the door.

469
00:47:42,555 --> 00:47:44,341
Who is it?
- Police.

470
00:47:44,645 --> 00:47:46,722
There is a warrant in
the name of Arjun Singh.

471
00:47:47,314 --> 00:47:50,350
Oh, God! I think he has
shown his stunts there too!

472
00:47:51,656 --> 00:47:53,759
Coming!

473
00:48:00,305 --> 00:48:03,966
What is the matter, inspector?
Arjun is not here...

474
00:48:04,705 --> 00:48:06,297
what has he done?

475
00:48:06,377 --> 00:48:09,509
His fault is that your Arjun
has become an inspector!

476
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:11,924
Arjun.

477
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,333
Mother...my dear mother!

478
00:48:16,598 --> 00:48:17,565
How are you?

479
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:20,455
Put me down,
you will fall and drop me too!

480
00:48:20,535 --> 00:48:24,051
Your son's arms are not so weak
that they will drop you.

481
00:48:26,057 --> 00:48:28,985
Mother, isn't brother looking
very nice in this uniform?

482
00:48:29,621 --> 00:48:32,743
Am I not looking? I hope you don't
cast your evil eye upon me!

483
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:36,300
Mother, tell him not to tease me!
-He is just kidding!

484
00:48:36,621 --> 00:48:38,327
How can a sister cast an evil eye?

485
00:48:39,594 --> 00:48:44,152
Arjun, you look very weak,
didn't they give you food there?

486
00:48:44,409 --> 00:48:46,736
I was deprived of only one thing.
-What?

487
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,853
Here, take this...you imp!
- Mother.

488
00:49:02,933 --> 00:49:04,458
I'm sorry, mother.
- Mother.

489
00:49:04,538 --> 00:49:08,662
Mother.
- My son.

490
00:49:19,152 --> 00:49:20,385
Hello, Arjun.
- Hi, Raj.

491
00:49:20,652 --> 00:49:23,858
Arjun, you've been posted in
Mumbai's most notorious area.

492
00:49:24,123 --> 00:49:26,459
It's called Shaitan Chowki,
a known criminal lives there...

493
00:49:26,689 --> 00:49:29,627
his name is Bhaiji and
whoever comes in this way...

494
00:49:30,045 --> 00:49:32,190
he kills that person.
- What?

495
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:34,538
That is why, everyone hesitates
being posted there.

496
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,122
But you be on alert.

497
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,323
Mr. Lalia.

498
00:50:22,317 --> 00:50:23,584
Mr. Lalia.

499
00:50:24,593 --> 00:50:28,338
Bhaiji, you?! 
Tell me, how can I serve you?

500
00:50:28,554 --> 00:50:31,435
From today, this factory belongs to me!
- To you?!

501
00:50:31,515 --> 00:50:34,710
How is this possible?
-It already has become possible!

502
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:37,859
Look, the owner has handed
over the papers in my name.

503
00:50:37,939 --> 00:50:38,961
But, Bhaiji...

504
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:47,135
Hey, Laliya! Don't play with fire,
water and Bhaiji...

505
00:50:47,872 --> 00:50:52,818
fire burns, water drowns
and Bhaiji tortures.

506
00:50:53,868 --> 00:50:57,490
I understand Bhaiji, 
who has the daring to defy you?

507
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:00,405
I have seen Ministers
falling at your feet.

508
00:51:01,005 --> 00:51:04,253
I will vacate this place
within one hour.

509
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,038
You are quite intelligent.

510
00:51:06,985 --> 00:51:08,306
See you.

511
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:17,406
What does your Minister want?
Let's go and check.

512
00:51:17,716 --> 00:51:20,516
The God of poor and the
Almighty of the unemployed...

513
00:51:21,533 --> 00:51:25,350
a great Minister like
Ramsukh Jadhav called you here...

514
00:51:25,747 --> 00:51:31,106
but, you didn't come, I had to send
my workers to get you here.

515
00:51:31,753 --> 00:51:34,249
You measly, inspector...

516
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:36,466
you are trying to defy
a known minister like me?

517
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,465
Come on, give that file to me.

518
00:51:40,126 --> 00:51:44,564
I will not, this file has
evidence against all your crimes!

519
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:47,383
I understand everything!

520
00:51:48,116 --> 00:51:51,058
You are suffering from
the disease of honesty.

521
00:51:51,138 --> 00:51:53,645
You will suffer this
disease all your life...

522
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,142
but, you will not gain anything!

523
00:51:56,789 --> 00:51:59,612
Listen to me and
stop acting foolish.

524
00:51:59,692 --> 00:52:04,091
Give the file to me and you
can take some money in return.

525
00:52:04,171 --> 00:52:07,412
You can own a house,
start a business or get married.

526
00:52:08,844 --> 00:52:11,851
Idiot, don't massage my legs.
Give him his gift.

527
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:19,668
It has five hundred thousand rupees.

528
00:52:21,107 --> 00:52:25,551
I don't want this gift! 
Now the police will give you a gift!

529
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:30,201
Hey! I am talking to you nicely
and yet you don't understand?

530
00:52:30,281 --> 00:52:34,012
But, you don't know when things
cannot be done in the right manner...

531
00:52:34,207 --> 00:52:36,840
then I even know how to get
the things in a wrong manner!

532
00:52:37,176 --> 00:52:41,840
Get lost from here! Go home and
treat the disease of honesty in you!

533
00:52:42,372 --> 00:52:44,507
I will not spare you!

534
00:52:44,651 --> 00:52:48,680
Let me see how you won't! Hey,
you worm from the gutters of honesty!

535
00:52:54,314 --> 00:52:55,412
Bhaiji.

536
00:53:11,178 --> 00:53:13,538
Inspector, Bhaiji has called you!

537
00:53:13,618 --> 00:53:16,339
So now the minister has roped
in Bhaiji into this matter?

538
00:53:16,997 --> 00:53:22,202
And Bhaiji has sent his men
here to threaten me?

539
00:53:25,122 --> 00:53:26,220
Leave me.

540
00:53:57,707 --> 00:54:02,518
Don't play with fire,
water and Bhaiji.

541
00:54:04,123 --> 00:54:12,075
Fire burns, water drowns
and Bhaiji tortures!

542
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:49,560
You cannot leave me and go!

543
00:55:00,416 --> 00:55:03,000
Where is the other dead body?
-Other dead body?

544
00:55:04,183 --> 00:55:06,045
Yes.
- I don't understand.

545
00:55:06,267 --> 00:55:10,874
You didn't understand
or you are pretending to be ignorant?

546
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,091
I want to know where
that Bhaiji's corpse is?

547
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:18,934
He is the one who snatched
my husband from me.

548
00:55:21,826 --> 00:55:29,644
I want to see that Bhaiji,
that rascal's corpse too!

549
00:55:30,145 --> 00:55:31,838
How can you accuse anyone
without any proof?

550
00:55:31,918 --> 00:55:32,671
Proof?

551
00:55:32,751 --> 00:55:34,582
What proof do you want?

552
00:55:36,408 --> 00:55:42,043
Cowards! You are a disappointment
to law and to humanity!

553
00:55:43,947 --> 00:55:51,989
But, I will not be quiet!
I will scream and tell everyone...

554
00:55:52,342 --> 00:55:57,744
that my husband's
murderer is Bhaiji!

555
00:56:02,508 --> 00:56:08,384
You are smart, within 24 hours,
you are outside your factory.

556
00:56:10,843 --> 00:56:13,790
It is not easy to take over
Laliya's factory, Bhaiji!

557
00:56:14,377 --> 00:56:17,112
Just take a look around you.

558
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,960
A dog should never hunt for a lion!

559
00:56:29,541 --> 00:56:33,908
Because, when a lion roars,
the dog forgets to bark!

560
00:56:42,354 --> 00:56:48,675
I'll give you a death in which
there will be no final rites!

561
00:56:50,279 --> 00:56:56,681
Put him the boiler!
-No, Bhaiji!! Bhaiji, please stop them.

562
00:56:58,573 --> 00:57:00,364
No!

563
00:57:07,463 --> 00:57:13,345
Welcome sir, your enemy
has been roasted to death.

564
00:57:14,054 --> 00:57:16,911
This is for you.
-Have you got the exact amount?

565
00:57:17,686 --> 00:57:22,609
You can count it.
It is exact.

566
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:25,453
Bhaiji, can I get the papers?
-Which papers?

567
00:57:25,913 --> 00:57:28,611
The factory papers, Bhaiji!

568
00:57:28,691 --> 00:57:35,731
I have no papers.
-But, you promised, Bhaiji!

569
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:39,468
That was a verbal promise but,
my heart wants something else.

570
00:57:40,479 --> 00:57:41,567
Put him also in the boiler!

571
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:48,689
No Bhaiji, 
please don't do this to me!

572
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:52,284
What are you doing? Leave me.

573
00:58:05,764 --> 00:58:08,011
Bhaiji, come there.

574
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:14,479
Seeing your face I feel that you
have killed that honest inspector.

575
00:58:15,031 --> 00:58:18,122
You did a very nice thing.
-Show me the stuff!

576
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:19,474
Bhaiji.

577
00:58:20,046 --> 00:58:25,914
Sure! But listen, 
why don't you reduce your murder rates?

578
00:58:26,391 --> 00:58:28,645
If you charge so much for
each and every murder...

579
00:58:28,725 --> 00:58:32,759
then I will become a pauper
and lose my sleep!

580
00:58:32,839 --> 00:58:36,021
You earn because of me and
you don't wish to part with my share?

581
00:58:36,673 --> 00:58:41,164
I will pluck out your eyes and
you will not be able to see your chair!

582
00:58:42,039 --> 00:58:43,716
Don't say that! 

583
00:58:43,796 --> 00:58:45,886
Who creates riots 
and makes you win in elections?

584
00:58:45,966 --> 00:58:48,853
You, Bhaiji.
-Who silences the public?

585
00:58:48,933 --> 00:58:50,202
You, who else? 

586
00:58:50,282 --> 00:58:51,920
Then why are you asking me
to reduce my rates?

587
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:55,997
You cannot even make a speech,
you talk like a roadside rogue!

588
00:58:57,547 --> 00:58:59,014
What are you saying, Bhaiji?

589
00:58:59,094 --> 00:59:00,233
Brother, do you need anything?

590
00:59:01,866 --> 00:59:03,729
I don't need anything,
you go inside!

591
00:59:05,537 --> 00:59:08,027
Bhaiji.
- Who is this lass?

592
00:59:08,847 --> 00:59:12,336
She is my sister.
-She is quite attractive.

593
00:59:12,416 --> 00:59:16,563
Why have you hidden her?
-Bhaiji, here is your money!

594
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:20,039
Bhaiji, you have taken the money
but, where is the file?

595
00:59:20,165 --> 00:59:23,549
This money is for committing a murder,
not for giving the file!

596
00:59:23,629 --> 00:59:24,831
Got it?

597
00:59:24,911 --> 00:59:29,793
Bhaiji, being on my side,
you play games with me?

598
00:59:30,136 --> 00:59:32,245
Okay tell me, 
how much do you want for the file?

599
00:59:32,419 --> 00:59:33,936
You'll not get the file.
-Why?

600
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:39,418
To tame the bear, 
you have to put a rope through his nose.

601
00:59:40,254 --> 00:59:43,209
You are the bear and
the file is that rope!

602
00:59:43,767 --> 00:59:48,262
And when I will pull the rope, 
you will stand on your legs and dance!

603
00:59:49,478 --> 00:59:53,583
What a brilliant idea, Bhaiji...

604
00:59:53,663 --> 00:59:56,370
I will make the public dance
and you make me dance!

605
01:00:08,199 --> 01:00:10,277
Arjun Singh Baksh from Pune.

606
01:00:11,933 --> 01:00:12,800
Sorry, sir.

607
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,669
We had the information
of your arrival...

608
01:00:14,889 --> 01:00:19,296
but, we didn't know you
would come unexpectedly!

609
01:00:19,376 --> 01:00:21,738
My name is Arjun Singh Baksh...

610
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:26,885
and I don't spare the people who sleep
or wile their time on duty!

611
01:00:26,965 --> 01:00:28,223
Yes, sir.

612
01:00:29,102 --> 01:00:30,381
What is your name?

613
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:34,524
Dharam Varma. Sub inspector.

614
01:00:36,905 --> 01:00:39,393
So sub inspector Dharam Verma.
- Yes, sir.

615
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:42,452
I want Bhaiji's file.

616
01:00:42,893 --> 01:00:46,314
Sorry sir, 
there is no file in such a name.

617
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,126
What?...The known criminal
of this area...

618
01:00:51,196 --> 01:00:54,041
whose crimes are known
even in Poona...

619
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:56,866
you are telling me that
there is no file in his name?

620
01:00:57,402 --> 01:00:58,811
How is that possible?

621
01:00:59,504 --> 01:01:04,605
Wherever I am,
I have the key of my enemy in my hand.

622
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:10,419
You are a journalist and
collect reports against us?

623
01:01:11,758 --> 01:01:13,490
You click our pictures on sly?

624
01:01:16,201 --> 01:01:19,408
It's a nice picture.
What will you do with it?

625
01:01:20,829 --> 01:01:23,912
I'll give it to the police
and print it in the newspaper.

626
01:01:24,035 --> 01:01:27,080
What will happen
if you print it in the paper?

627
01:01:28,091 --> 01:01:30,256
I've killed many such inspectors!

628
01:01:30,917 --> 01:01:32,412
But, nobody can reach me!

629
01:01:46,591 --> 01:01:49,829
You think that the entire
Mumbai city fears you?

630
01:01:50,323 --> 01:01:56,666
Don't forget, there are more
brave men like inspector Rohit!

631
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:02,806
What did you say? 
- Your crimes have crossed a limit!

632
01:02:03,235 --> 01:02:06,549
It just needs to be exposed!

633
01:02:16,268 --> 01:02:20,060
So what if you tear this file,
I will prepare another file!

634
01:02:20,491 --> 01:02:22,729
I will expose you to the world!

635
01:02:23,075 --> 01:02:25,609
The one who tries to expose me...

636
01:02:27,805 --> 01:02:31,101
I kill that person!

637
01:02:39,082 --> 01:02:40,619
Bhaiji.

638
01:02:46,068 --> 01:02:50,540
For the first time some inspector
has dared to come to my office!

639
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:53,067
I have heard many stories
about your crime...

640
01:02:53,147 --> 01:02:54,784
But, nobody has read them.

641
01:02:55,798 --> 01:02:58,269
Because, nobody dared to write it.

642
01:02:58,393 --> 01:03:02,582
Don't worry, I have come here
to make a file of your crimes!

643
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:05,141
Inspector Arjun Singh Baksh.

644
01:03:05,547 --> 01:03:09,194
You have come but,
do you think you can go back?

645
01:03:09,274 --> 01:03:14,151
Of course I can, and if I want,
I can take you along with me.

646
01:03:14,652 --> 01:03:17,983
But unfortunately, 
I don't have any evidence against you.

647
01:03:20,512 --> 01:03:23,226
The proof is always at my feet!

648
01:03:24,364 --> 01:03:27,822
One has to just look for it...

649
01:03:29,093 --> 01:03:31,133
and try to grab it!

650
01:03:32,387 --> 01:03:34,203
If you have the guts
then handcuff me!

651
01:03:34,533 --> 01:03:40,318
I will show you all those things
which you had never dreamed of!

652
01:03:40,398 --> 01:03:41,804
Inspector!

653
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:50,504
Don't ever play with
fire, water and Bhaiji.

654
01:03:51,586 --> 01:03:58,060
Fire burns, water drowns
and Bhaiji tortures!

655
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:02,447
I am acquainted with the flames of
fire and the depth of water...

656
01:04:02,887 --> 01:04:07,223
but today, I vow not to
spare a criminal like you!

657
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,074
Good morning, sir.

658
01:04:13,154 --> 01:04:14,896
Greeting, sir.
-Why are you in this state?

659
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:16,752
Sir, that...
-Where is your uniform?

660
01:04:16,832 --> 01:04:18,036
Sir, that..

661
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:29,606
Is this the time to come to office?

662
01:04:29,686 --> 01:04:31,717
Deepa.
- What, Deepa?

663
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:35,550
Call me inspector Deepa Sahani
and that too, with respect.

664
01:04:35,822 --> 01:04:36,971
Deepa.

665
01:04:37,408 --> 01:04:39,624
You called out my name again?
Constable!

666
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:40,943
Yes, sir.

667
01:04:41,451 --> 01:04:43,246
You get out.
- Yes, sir.

668
01:04:43,657 --> 01:04:44,608
Deepa.

669
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:47,761
This is a police station, not your house.
-I know it!

670
01:04:48,011 --> 01:04:50,325
Now remove the uniform.
-If you say then...

671
01:04:51,492 --> 01:04:52,320
Deepa, please.

672
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,568
Okay, I am removing...take this!

673
01:04:57,065 --> 01:04:57,822
Constable!

674
01:04:57,902 --> 01:04:58,860
Yes, sir.

675
01:05:01,098 --> 01:05:03,725
I just hate you, Arjun.

676
01:05:04,157 --> 01:05:08,974
You had no time to inquire how I am,
where I am?

677
01:05:09,147 --> 01:05:10,975
If something would happen to...

678
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:15,929
Ms. Deepa Sahani, I have lodged
your complain in my mind.

679
01:05:16,249 --> 01:05:20,999
First tell me,
why did you come here?

680
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:24,262
I came here because, the area
in which you had seen a house...

681
01:05:24,342 --> 01:05:26,488
I have spoken to Mr. Shinde there.

682
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:30,140
You go and meet him and
call mother and Sapna here.

683
01:05:30,366 --> 01:05:32,675
I had come to tell you this.

684
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:36,516
Thank you. And that...
-Enough, I know what you want to say.

685
01:05:36,596 --> 01:05:38,947
I know you will ask me to leave
because you are busy.

686
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,950
I am leaving,
I have not come to stay here.

687
01:05:42,411 --> 01:05:43,870
Bye.
- Bye.

688
01:05:46,357 --> 01:05:47,114
Deepa.

689
01:05:51,078 --> 01:05:51,943
Arjun.

690
01:06:18,718 --> 01:06:23,959
"Please explain to me what love is"

691
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:29,065
"Please explain to me what love is"

692
01:06:29,145 --> 01:06:34,352
"My heart wants to know
if you are aware of it?"

693
01:06:34,432 --> 01:06:39,432
"My heart wants to know
if you are aware of it?"

694
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:44,807
"Please tell me the secret of love"

695
01:06:44,887 --> 01:06:49,907
"Please explain to me what love is"

696
01:06:49,987 --> 01:06:54,893
"My heart wants to know
if you are aware of it?"

697
01:06:55,094 --> 01:07:00,019
"Please tell me the secret of love"

698
01:07:00,327 --> 01:07:08,359
"Please explain to me what love is"

699
01:07:13,181 --> 01:07:23,414
"You perhaps know what love is,
teach me how to read your eyes"

700
01:07:23,494 --> 01:07:28,459
"I am not aware of it,
please teach me"

701
01:07:28,539 --> 01:07:38,705
"You perhaps know what love is,
teach me how to read your eyes"

702
01:07:38,881 --> 01:07:43,549
"I am not aware of it,
please teach me"

703
01:07:43,629 --> 01:07:48,358
"Now that my curiosity is aroused,
my beloved, don't torment me"

704
01:07:48,438 --> 01:07:53,360
"Please explain to me what love is"

705
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,447
"My heart wants to know
if you are aware of it?"

706
01:07:58,527 --> 01:08:02,797
"Please tell me the secret of love"

707
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:11,449
"Please explain to me what love is"

708
01:08:31,666 --> 01:08:39,509
"I surely will teach you,
I am not so immature..."

709
01:08:39,589 --> 01:08:46,799
"I will teach you
how to fall in love"

710
01:08:46,993 --> 01:08:54,742
"I surely will teach you,
I am not so immature..."

711
01:08:54,943 --> 01:09:02,250
"I will teach you
how to fall in love"

712
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:07,270
"I am thankful to you, my dear"

713
01:09:51,352 --> 01:09:54,826
It had to rain today!
Come on, hurry up!

714
01:09:55,114 --> 01:09:58,173
Arjun, I was waiting for you.

715
01:09:58,253 --> 01:10:01,919
Mr. Shinde, this is my mother
and she is my sister, Sapna.

716
01:10:01,999 --> 01:10:02,590
Hello.

717
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:04,778
Mother, he is Mr. Shinde,
the owner of this house.

718
01:10:04,858 --> 01:10:07,723
Hello.
Arjun praises you a lot.

719
01:10:07,884 --> 01:10:10,534
Mother, Mr. Shinde indeed
is a very nice man.

720
01:10:10,614 --> 01:10:13,279
I have to go to visit the Commissioner,
please give the keys.

721
01:10:16,699 --> 01:10:18,653
My life is precious to me,...

722
01:10:19,121 --> 01:10:22,943
I don't want to give you the house
and enlist myself as Bahiji's enemy.

723
01:10:23,339 --> 01:10:24,549
I too have a family.

724
01:10:24,809 --> 01:10:26,957
I don't want to endanger their lives.

725
01:10:27,374 --> 01:10:29,917
Go and make arrangements for
your stay somewhere else.

726
01:10:30,171 --> 01:10:34,201
If you didn't want to give the house,
you could refused earlier.

727
01:10:34,281 --> 01:10:37,192
I had no idea that you
were under Bhaiji's wrath!

728
01:10:37,272 --> 01:10:39,366
Brother.
- Why are you chanting his name?

729
01:10:40,031 --> 01:10:42,839
If he is a goon
then I too am a caretaker of law!

730
01:10:43,953 --> 01:10:47,832
You may be a police inspector
or a Collector, it makes no difference!

731
01:10:48,126 --> 01:10:52,940
Whatever you will do, you
will do within the parameters of law.

732
01:10:53,164 --> 01:10:55,464
But, whatever Bhaiji does,
is his law!

733
01:10:55,645 --> 01:10:57,813
Isn't it?
-Yes!!

734
01:10:57,984 --> 01:11:01,755
Aunty, if you don't wish to see
your son dead then return back.

735
01:11:02,666 --> 01:11:05,704
We don't care if he or his family dies!

736
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:08,100
We don't want to endanger our
lives by giving him a house here.

737
01:11:08,274 --> 01:11:11,006
We will not let you live here.
-That's right, we will not!

738
01:11:11,086 --> 01:11:17,705
Shut up, you cowards!  Inspector,
you have come to live here?

739
01:11:17,995 --> 01:11:20,711
Amongst these coward
and impotent men?

740
01:11:20,979 --> 01:11:26,066
In front of their eyes, 
Bhaiji takes away their womenfolk...

741
01:11:26,146 --> 01:11:31,160
he disgraces their honor but,
they have no guts to defy him!

742
01:11:31,378 --> 01:11:34,513
And after his threat, do you think
they will let you stay here?

743
01:11:35,131 --> 01:11:41,501
Inspector, the one who has the
daring to defy that Bhaiji...

744
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:45,751
will only let you live here!

745
01:11:48,244 --> 01:11:54,806
The one who has no fear of life
and has no family to cry for.

746
01:11:56,222 --> 01:11:59,258
And I am that person, inspector!

747
01:11:59,585 --> 01:12:01,861
Come with me! Come, aunty!

748
01:12:15,327 --> 01:12:19,628
This is my husband's picture
who was killed by Bhaiji.

749
01:12:19,929 --> 01:12:24,407
Bhaiji, inspector Rohit's wife has
given refuge to Arjun in her house.

750
01:12:28,957 --> 01:12:32,878
I am going, mother.
- Arjun, is Bhaiji a very dangerous man?

751
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,100
Why does everyone fear him so much?

752
01:12:35,432 --> 01:12:39,016
They don't fear him,
these decent people fear their honor!

753
01:12:39,096 --> 01:12:40,957
But, what enmity
do you share with him?

754
01:12:41,211 --> 01:12:46,612
It's simple, he commits crime
and I stop his crime!

755
01:12:47,086 --> 01:12:50,840
Seeing this fear for Bhaiji
terrorizes me!

756
01:12:51,376 --> 01:12:54,173
Listen to me,
please get a transfer somewhere else.

757
01:12:54,253 --> 01:12:58,579
Aunty, ask him to get a transfer
where there is no other Bhaiji!

758
01:12:59,092 --> 01:13:02,072
Where there is no crime
and only justice prevails!

759
01:13:02,956 --> 01:13:07,355
But, perhaps there is no place where
people like Bhaiji don't exist!

760
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:11,001
I am a mother, 
I always fear the unknown.

761
01:13:12,738 --> 01:13:15,189
Please don't get scared,
I am leaving.

762
01:13:23,575 --> 01:13:24,947
Did brother leave?
-Yes.

763
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:29,815
He left without eating?
-He hasn't eaten since morning.

764
01:13:30,062 --> 01:13:35,053
Don't worry, I'll go to the police
station and give him the food.

765
01:13:35,133 --> 01:13:36,047
Okay.

766
01:13:36,127 --> 01:13:41,075
But child, how will you in this rain,
at this hour?

767
01:13:41,269 --> 01:13:43,959
Don't worry aunty,
I will be back in a jiffy!

768
01:13:44,151 --> 01:13:45,271
Hurry up, Sapna.

769
01:13:45,578 --> 01:13:46,507
Here.

770
01:13:46,788 --> 01:13:49,782
Sapna, you both have dinner.
-No, we'll have when you return.

771
01:13:49,862 --> 01:13:52,475
Alright but, lock the door
and windows properly.

772
01:13:52,555 --> 01:13:54,801
I'll come back soon.
-Take care, child.

773
01:13:55,407 --> 01:13:56,434
Come, mother.

774
01:14:20,641 --> 01:14:25,193
Wretched woman! I made you
a widow when you were young...

775
01:14:26,023 --> 01:14:27,479
and yet you did not learn a lesson?

776
01:14:27,677 --> 01:14:32,058
You have wounded my soul!

777
01:14:32,636 --> 01:14:37,166
Some day, I will injure you in a way
that you will plead at my feet!

778
01:14:37,246 --> 01:14:41,423
You will plead for your death but,
you will not get it!

779
01:14:42,156 --> 01:14:44,539
You will rot!

780
01:14:44,619 --> 01:14:47,987
Why did you give refuge
to that inspector?

781
01:14:48,532 --> 01:14:50,691
With whose permission did you
give him refuge, tell me?

782
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:54,835
It is my house, you impotent man!

783
01:14:56,699 --> 01:15:02,542
You called me impotent?
-Yes, you are!

784
01:15:02,753 --> 01:15:06,210
My husband was a man who
challenged a weakling like you!

785
01:15:09,433 --> 01:15:12,041
Your husband died here
and you too will die here!

786
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:21,728
But first, I will prove it to you that
I am a man!

787
01:15:40,441 --> 01:15:42,775
Good morning, sir.
- Very good morning, Mahesh.

788
01:15:42,855 --> 01:15:45,494
I want to go to ex Commissioner,
Raj Sahani's house...

789
01:15:45,716 --> 01:15:49,750
if you have some work, contact
me there or at my residence.  Ok?

790
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:50,673
Yes, sir.
- Arjun.

791
01:15:53,862 --> 01:15:54,857
Arjun.

792
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:56,760
Ratna.

793
01:15:59,571 --> 01:16:00,953
How did this...

794
01:16:04,204 --> 01:16:10,365
Bhaiji and his men have
snatched my honor...

795
01:16:14,673 --> 01:16:23,901
they repeatedly raped me
throughout the night.

796
01:16:24,461 --> 01:16:29,005
I will not spare that scoundrel!
I will kill him!

797
01:16:29,263 --> 01:16:36,362
Yes, kill him
or he will kill the goodness.

798
01:16:38,035 --> 01:16:43,112
Only crime will prevail
and he will kill decent human beings.

799
01:16:45,447 --> 01:16:47,958
He is a stigma to the society.

800
01:16:48,038 --> 01:16:53,238
Yes, I will wipe out this stigma!
Someone get the ambulance quickly!

801
01:16:53,546 --> 01:16:55,578
Ratna. Ratna.

802
01:17:02,097 --> 01:17:08,121
Inspector, you must have received
the reward of my enmity.

803
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:09,554
Bhaiji!

804
01:17:09,911 --> 01:17:12,798
Thankfully you have learnt
to talk with respect.

805
01:17:14,145 --> 01:17:17,048
Now teach your mind something.

806
01:17:18,646 --> 01:17:25,531
I will put you in a much worse
condition than that lady!

807
01:17:25,611 --> 01:17:32,817
Time yourself, in exact one hour,
I will drag you to my police station!

808
01:17:33,095 --> 01:17:37,679
After that, I will be at peace only
when I send you to the gallows.

809
01:17:40,535 --> 01:17:43,570
Wishful thinking!

810
01:17:43,963 --> 01:17:47,988
Listen, only my law exists here.

811
01:17:49,836 --> 01:17:57,797
If you are so hot blooded then
come here and test your strength!

812
01:19:43,526 --> 01:19:48,446
Hey, inspector! Are you crazy?

813
01:19:49,363 --> 01:19:52,917
You have locked me up behind bars?

814
01:19:53,807 --> 01:20:00,676
You are very happy?
But, your happiness is short lived...

815
01:20:01,496 --> 01:20:05,420
no bars are strong enough
to hold me for a long time!

816
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:13,067
Sad, nobody informed you that
I have made those bars!

817
01:20:13,539 --> 01:20:17,233
I am the one who does
not spare any criminal!

818
01:20:17,461 --> 01:20:20,772
Inspector, don't consider
yourself God...

819
01:20:22,091 --> 01:20:27,118
don't play with fire,
water and Bhaiji!

820
01:20:28,002 --> 01:20:32,860
Fire burns, water drowns and...
-Bhaiji tortures!

821
01:20:33,372 --> 01:20:36,542
The way you tortured
Rohit and his wife?

822
01:20:36,939 --> 01:20:41,143
Similarly, I too will torture you
and take you to the gallows!

823
01:20:41,223 --> 01:20:43,216
I will kill you before that, inspector!

824
01:20:44,068 --> 01:20:49,218
Because, I am like a snake who has
the picture of his enemy in his eyes!

825
01:20:50,035 --> 01:20:54,106
Look into my eyes, you will see the
picture of your family's doom!

826
01:20:55,108 --> 01:20:59,914
What you have done today,
no police officer has ever done it.

827
01:21:00,162 --> 01:21:04,176
Agreed but, you also know that
Bhaiji is a very dangerous man.

828
01:21:04,909 --> 01:21:07,094
Why didn't any other police officer
dare to arrest him?

829
01:21:07,536 --> 01:21:10,321
Not only because,
he is very dangerous.

830
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:15,799
It is because, all the minister,
officers are puppets in his hands.

831
01:21:15,983 --> 01:21:18,454
Maybe, but there is
something called law.

832
01:21:19,005 --> 01:21:22,248
If he continues his tyranny,
we cannot sit quietly and watch!

833
01:21:22,901 --> 01:21:26,657
Sir, there is no account
of his crimes...

834
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,008
because today, for the first time
a file in his name is made.

835
01:21:29,646 --> 01:21:32,725
But very soon, this file will
be in the godown of law...

836
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:35,566
and Bhaiji will be hung at the noose!

837
01:21:35,646 --> 01:21:36,455
Good.

838
01:21:37,473 --> 01:21:39,072
I am proud of you...

839
01:21:39,763 --> 01:21:43,469
that you are chosen by me and
you are so talented and honest!

840
01:21:44,779 --> 01:21:48,657
If you continue to do your duty
in this manner then one day...

841
01:21:48,995 --> 01:21:52,145
the entire police department
will be proud of you!

842
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:53,525
Thank you, sir.

843
01:22:02,658 --> 01:22:08,513
Son, look at this!
Look what Bhaiji's men have done.

844
01:22:09,141 --> 01:22:11,964
Even Ratna has not
come back since last night.

845
01:22:14,001 --> 01:22:16,676
Mother, Ratna is not alive.

846
01:22:17,206 --> 01:22:20,774
What? 
-Yes mother, Bhaiji killed her.

847
01:22:21,252 --> 01:22:22,889
But, I too have not spared him.

848
01:22:23,728 --> 01:22:25,465
I have put him behind bars!

849
01:22:26,182 --> 01:22:28,230
And I will take him to the gallows.

850
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:32,435
Which gallows, inspector?

851
01:22:33,819 --> 01:22:35,328
Which law are you talking about?

852
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,783
An insignificant inspector...

853
01:22:40,901 --> 01:22:43,625
was trying to put
a lion behind bars?

854
01:22:43,705 --> 01:22:46,165
Look, a lion is standing
in front of you!

855
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:52,146
Where will you go now?
Whose help will you seek?

856
01:22:52,816 --> 01:22:58,717
You dragged me to the jail for
the sake of an unknown girl?

857
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:04,714
You pride in your uniform
and it's strength, isn't it?

858
01:23:07,222 --> 01:23:09,612
I give you seven days...

859
01:23:11,933 --> 01:23:13,881
you can show me your strength
in these seven days.

860
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:21,938
You can knock at the doors of law,
ring their bells...

861
01:23:23,116 --> 01:23:26,039
and on the seventh day,
come and stand here.

862
01:23:26,676 --> 01:23:30,642
In front of your eyes,
I will deflower your sister!

863
01:23:30,722 --> 01:23:32,345
You!

864
01:23:36,325 --> 01:23:37,541
Arjun.

865
01:24:02,921 --> 01:24:06,926
No sir, this is a lie!
It's a false accusation on me!

866
01:24:07,435 --> 01:24:11,954
I didn't purposely kill inspector
Mahesh, I had no personal grudge.

867
01:24:12,896 --> 01:24:19,552
But as per the eye witness, Bhaiji,
you purposely killed Mahesh!

868
01:24:19,632 --> 01:24:22,962
Sir, that rogue Bhaiji is my enemy!

869
01:24:23,497 --> 01:24:26,184
Because,
I arrested him for raping Ratna!

870
01:24:26,383 --> 01:24:31,035
Wrong! The man who raped
Ratna is in the lock up!

871
01:24:31,115 --> 01:24:35,444
That man came to my house and
challenged me in public that...

872
01:24:35,948 --> 01:24:38,601
he would molest my sister Sapna,
on the seventh day!

873
01:24:38,681 --> 01:24:45,571
No, to avenge your personal grudge,
you framed Bhaiji for raping Ratna.

874
01:24:46,711 --> 01:24:51,398
And when inspector Mahesh released
innocent Bhaiji and arrested..

875
01:24:51,478 --> 01:24:54,629
the real culprit and came to you
to prove Bhaiji's innocence...

876
01:24:54,763 --> 01:24:57,231
you were enraged and
killed the inspector!

877
01:24:57,381 --> 01:25:00,800
This is a lie!
-Don't speak nonsense!

878
01:25:01,532 --> 01:25:04,625
People like you taint
the police department.

879
01:25:07,548 --> 01:25:13,082
You make us bow with shame!
How dare you malign decent people?

880
01:25:13,997 --> 01:25:16,618
Bhaiji is decent?

881
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:20,894
I thought you were a honest officer
and would confer justice.

882
01:25:21,511 --> 01:25:24,428
I expected that you would
protect my mother and sister.

883
01:25:25,277 --> 01:25:29,362
But the words you have uttered
are not your own...

884
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:33,184
it sounds like words of the people
who have been bought by Bhaiji!

885
01:25:33,264 --> 01:25:35,364
Arjun.
- You have been bribed, sir!

886
01:26:21,536 --> 01:26:23,447
"My heart dances to your music"

887
01:26:24,877 --> 01:26:27,227
"I belong to you, my dear"

888
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,774
"My heart dances to your music"

889
01:26:32,047 --> 01:26:33,781
"I belong to you, my dear"

890
01:26:33,961 --> 01:26:38,642
"My youth burns like
the flame of the lamp"

891
01:26:42,996 --> 01:26:45,097
"My heart dances to your music"

892
01:26:46,308 --> 01:26:48,329
"I belong to you, my dear"

893
01:26:48,409 --> 01:26:52,732
"My youth burns like
the flame of the lamp"

894
01:27:27,666 --> 01:27:31,090
"Quench the thirst
of my parched lips"

895
01:27:31,294 --> 01:27:35,382
"My desires are unfulfilled,
embrace me"

896
01:27:38,389 --> 01:27:41,943
"Quench the thirst
of my parched lips"

897
01:27:42,084 --> 01:27:45,471
"My desires are unfulfilled,
embrace me"

898
01:27:45,551 --> 01:27:49,634
"Love me, O my dear"

899
01:28:03,290 --> 01:28:08,059
"Never play with fire,
water and Bhaiji."

900
01:28:08,664 --> 01:28:14,410
"Fire burns, water drowns
and Bhaiji tortures!"

901
01:28:25,415 --> 01:28:28,836
"My love has pulled you here"

902
01:28:29,018 --> 01:28:32,732
"Once in my cage,
nobody can go out free"

903
01:28:35,784 --> 01:28:39,587
"My love has pulled you here"

904
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:43,281
"Once in my cage,
nobody can go out free"

905
01:28:43,428 --> 01:28:47,405
"You will ache when
you will yearn for me"

906
01:29:11,281 --> 01:29:15,172
Long live the Minister!!

907
01:29:15,252 --> 01:29:17,847
Greetings!

908
01:29:18,893 --> 01:29:26,744
So what if I am the Minister,
I take care of everyone!

909
01:29:26,824 --> 01:29:31,869
Why does this man look so pale?
Do you feed him or not?

910
01:29:32,014 --> 01:29:35,006
Do you give him food or you eat his share?
-We give him, sir!

911
01:29:36,018 --> 01:29:37,860
Feed them properly,
they are my children.

912
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:41,808
Why is he crying?
Hey! Why are you crying?

913
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:43,026
Minister.

914
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:44,716
What happened?

915
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:48,145
A lot of injustice
is being mete out to me.

916
01:29:48,526 --> 01:29:50,095
Nobody hears to my pleas.

917
01:29:50,404 --> 01:29:52,376
I am sure that
you will listen to me.

918
01:29:52,456 --> 01:29:56,435
What happened?
Who has mete out injustice on you?

919
01:29:56,764 --> 01:29:59,538
Please set me free, sir.

920
01:30:00,116 --> 01:30:03,821
Because, a goon called Bhaiji has
announced that he'll rape my sister!

921
01:30:06,324 --> 01:30:07,554
Bhaiji?

922
01:30:08,446 --> 01:30:12,449
Oh, I see! You don't worry...

923
01:30:13,148 --> 01:30:15,869
I will wipe out all your
worries and apprehensions!

924
01:30:16,094 --> 01:30:19,068
I will be indebted to you.

925
01:30:19,374 --> 01:30:21,645
I have not done any favor on you!

926
01:30:21,942 --> 01:30:27,766
Whoever it may be, if he's a tyrant,
the law will punish him too!

927
01:30:29,212 --> 01:30:32,425
You be rest assured.

928
01:30:33,052 --> 01:30:35,019
Good bye.

929
01:30:35,890 --> 01:30:37,025
Let's go.

930
01:30:46,752 --> 01:30:48,813
You are inspector Arjun, isn't it?

931
01:30:53,685 --> 01:30:58,492
Good I recognized you?
You wanted to fight Bhaiji?

932
01:31:01,157 --> 01:31:04,368
Bhaiji's enemy is my enemy too.

933
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:07,101
And my enemy is Bhaiji's enemy.

934
01:31:07,373 --> 01:31:15,329
You think I will free you? I
am going to make a noose ready for you!

935
01:31:15,544 --> 01:31:16,963
Scoundrel!

936
01:31:18,408 --> 01:31:19,733
Don't scream so much.

937
01:31:23,152 --> 01:31:24,152
Let's go, aunty.

938
01:31:46,688 --> 01:31:49,432
Don't worry, come with me.

939
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:57,596
What is this?
-Where are you taking them?

940
01:31:58,434 --> 01:32:00,841
To my house!
-You cannot take them.

941
01:32:02,066 --> 01:32:02,719
Why?

942
01:32:02,799 --> 01:32:05,928
If they are not found here,
Bhaiji will kill us!

943
01:32:07,835 --> 01:32:10,465
Bhaiji will remove us from
our houses and beat us up!

944
01:32:10,545 --> 01:32:13,296
There will be unaccountable
deaths here!

945
01:32:13,376 --> 01:32:15,050
Right!

946
01:32:15,409 --> 01:32:17,117
Police will click the pictures
of the corpses and go away.

947
01:32:17,344 --> 01:32:20,334
Our children will be orphaned
and our wives will be widowed.

948
01:32:20,414 --> 01:32:23,583
Bhaiji's men will molest
our sisters and wives!

949
01:32:23,663 --> 01:32:25,271
Yes!

950
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:28,717
Go back home!
-Don't touch them!

951
01:32:30,624 --> 01:32:33,712
And don't you dare stop us!

952
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:48,433
You perhaps don't know, I'm retired
police Commissioner, Raj Sahani!

953
01:32:48,908 --> 01:32:55,161
And if I want I can have you all
arrested on charges of threatening!

954
01:32:55,449 --> 01:32:57,980
It would be better if you
move away from our path!

955
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,488
And let me tell you
one more thing...

956
01:33:04,472 --> 01:33:06,898
Bhaiji cannot harm you.

957
01:33:08,879 --> 01:33:11,740
If you wish to live then learn
to look up in front of Bhaiji.

958
01:33:13,968 --> 01:33:16,195
Come with me.

959
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:20,572
Leave us at the mercy of Almighty.
Whatever has to happen will happen!

960
01:33:21,009 --> 01:33:24,340
You go away. Let's go, child.

961
01:33:25,346 --> 01:33:27,337
Let's go, child.

962
01:33:35,489 --> 01:33:40,208
If this is the case then I will send
8-10 constables for their safety.

963
01:33:40,601 --> 01:33:42,345
Thanks, Mr. Roy.
- You're welcome.

964
01:33:42,669 --> 01:33:43,899
Just a moment.

965
01:33:44,723 --> 01:33:45,444
Hello.

966
01:33:45,524 --> 01:33:48,150
I am Minister Ramsukh Jadhav speaking.

967
01:33:48,345 --> 01:33:51,182
Yes sir, tell me?
-How much police force do you have?

968
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:53,229
Send all of them to me.

969
01:33:53,597 --> 01:33:57,602
I am going out for a rally tomorrow.

970
01:33:57,682 --> 01:33:58,927
Ok, sir.

971
01:34:01,536 --> 01:34:04,418
Mr. Sahani, I am sorry,
I cannot help you.

972
01:34:04,819 --> 01:34:08,546
But you just promised that you
would send a few constables.

973
01:34:09,168 --> 01:34:10,986
Yes but, the minister
just called up...

974
01:34:11,066 --> 01:34:15,653
he is going on a rally and
has ordered to send the entire force.

975
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:19,748
Arjun.

976
01:34:21,001 --> 01:34:24,180
Whatever has happened with you...

977
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:27,548
I am solely responsible for it.

978
01:34:28,933 --> 01:34:31,419
If I would not tell you
to join the police force...

979
01:34:32,224 --> 01:34:34,351
then what has happened
would perhaps not happen!

980
01:34:35,331 --> 01:34:38,290
Sir, why are you holding
yourself responsible?

981
01:34:38,972 --> 01:34:42,313
I am not bothered about myself,
my only concern is that...

982
01:34:43,034 --> 01:34:44,626
what will happen to
my mother and sister?

983
01:34:44,706 --> 01:34:51,375
All our attempts to protect your
mother and sister have been futile.

984
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:56,962
These ministers and officers who
talk about public protection...

985
01:34:57,182 --> 01:34:59,265
are all been bribed by Bhaiji!

986
01:35:00,222 --> 01:35:03,392
Hey! Your time is over.
-Just a minute.

987
01:35:03,472 --> 01:35:05,968
Are you going or should I throw you out?
-Hey, constable!

988
01:35:06,048 --> 01:35:09,448
Hey! Neither are you an inspector
nor is he the Commissioner, go!

989
01:35:09,528 --> 01:35:13,838
You scoundrel!
-Get lost from here!

990
01:35:35,654 --> 01:35:37,746
Hey, old woman! Open the door.

991
01:35:38,089 --> 01:35:40,573
Look, Bhaiji has brought food for you.

992
01:35:40,833 --> 01:35:42,407
Open the door.

993
01:35:43,094 --> 01:35:46,662
Open the door, why are you scared?

994
01:35:47,732 --> 01:35:52,401
You rascal,
I am not scared of you, I hate you!

995
01:35:52,609 --> 01:35:56,531
But, I am in love
with your daughter!

996
01:35:56,684 --> 01:35:57,975
What should I do about that?

997
01:36:00,585 --> 01:36:06,470
I swear it Sapna,
I dreamed about you last night.

998
01:36:07,337 --> 01:36:11,923
You rascal! 
Don't forget that my Arjun is yet alive.

999
01:36:12,003 --> 01:36:16,667
Don't worry, very soon, he too
will be hung by the noose.

1000
01:36:16,834 --> 01:36:20,626
Arjun will be hung but only after,
he kills you!

1001
01:36:20,833 --> 01:36:23,517
Wishful thinking!

1002
01:36:26,046 --> 01:36:30,407
I have got some food for her.

1003
01:36:31,076 --> 01:36:33,549
Hey, Mangal! Get the food here.

1004
01:36:33,745 --> 01:36:35,087
I don't need your food!

1005
01:36:37,282 --> 01:36:41,346
You may not eat but,
Sapna will eat.

1006
01:36:43,088 --> 01:36:47,286
Only when she is well fed,
I will like her!

1007
01:36:49,284 --> 01:36:53,964
Eat, sweetheart.
-Sapna would have surely eaten this food.

1008
01:36:54,566 --> 01:36:59,362
Even I would have eaten if this food
was offered after your funeral.

1009
01:37:05,836 --> 01:37:09,571
Don't play with fire,
water and Bhaiji.

1010
01:37:10,971 --> 01:37:14,482
Mangal, throw whatever
food is there in the house.

1011
01:37:15,068 --> 01:37:16,956
And cut off the
water connection too.

1012
01:37:18,105 --> 01:37:23,472
When you will crave for every drop
of water and a little food...

1013
01:37:24,062 --> 01:37:27,657
only then will you know what I am!

1014
01:37:28,066 --> 01:37:33,896
Listen everyone! If anyone
tries to help this lady...

1015
01:37:34,393 --> 01:37:36,908
then there will be
only corpses in this area.

1016
01:37:42,588 --> 01:37:45,864
Mother! Come mother.

1017
01:37:59,405 --> 01:38:06,697
The tables have turned on you! I
am outside the jail and you are inside.

1018
01:38:10,041 --> 01:38:17,379
Did you recognize him? He is the same
whom you had thrashed a lot.

1019
01:38:18,049 --> 01:38:21,494
He is the jailer of this jail.

1020
01:38:23,054 --> 01:38:26,069
I will fill in all
your enemies in this jail.

1021
01:38:26,685 --> 01:38:29,473
And they will not let you
step out alive from here.

1022
01:38:33,305 --> 01:38:34,765
Bhaiji!

1023
01:38:45,721 --> 01:38:47,149
Arjun Singh!

1024
01:39:16,798 --> 01:39:19,355
Who is it?
-It's me, Sahani.

1025
01:39:31,859 --> 01:39:33,377
Come in, brother.

1026
01:39:37,106 --> 01:39:41,812
I have got food for you. 
-Why are you taking trouble for us?

1027
01:39:42,066 --> 01:39:46,663
It's no trouble,
I am just doing my duty.

1028
01:39:47,071 --> 01:39:48,663
Please eat.

1029
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:52,526
We will eat but,
you please go from here.

1030
01:39:52,713 --> 01:39:56,067
If Bhaiji or his men
see you helping us then...

1031
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:57,942
then they will harm you too!

1032
01:39:59,795 --> 01:40:01,013
Alright, I am going.

1033
01:40:04,614 --> 01:40:05,664
Please lock the door.

1034
01:40:20,383 --> 01:40:23,033
Eat, child.
- No!!

1035
01:40:34,027 --> 01:40:35,750
Come...sit.

1036
01:40:36,757 --> 01:40:40,586
I have not come here to sit,
I have come to talk to you!

1037
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:45,095
I feel proud that
my father's arms were cut...

1038
01:40:45,611 --> 01:40:47,858
the arms which were raised
against the monster, Bhaiji!

1039
01:40:48,259 --> 01:40:52,332
And your hands which are
raised to salute Bhaiji...

1040
01:40:52,666 --> 01:40:55,283
I condemn such hands!

1041
01:41:19,461 --> 01:41:26,692
A dynamite is fixed here,
everyone move away!

1042
01:41:56,067 --> 01:41:57,711
No, child!

1043
01:42:00,046 --> 01:42:01,639
No!!

1044
01:42:02,768 --> 01:42:08,353
Why did you make
an attempt of escaping?

1045
01:42:10,805 --> 01:42:16,679
Hey! You were trying to
get away from your cage?

1046
01:42:18,765 --> 01:42:26,760
Don't you know that the hunter
always clips the wings of the birds?

1047
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:31,105
Where were you running off to?
Speak up!

1048
01:42:31,185 --> 01:42:36,232
I tried to run so that,
I could kill you and feed you to dogs!

1049
01:42:36,312 --> 01:42:46,149
Then you see, 
how I torture you and put you to death!

1050
01:43:13,438 --> 01:43:16,141
No!

1051
01:43:16,811 --> 01:43:25,250
What happened, mother? Water?
You lie down, I will get water for you!

1052
01:43:25,784 --> 01:43:29,363
I will manage to get water,
you please lie down.

1053
01:43:29,443 --> 01:43:30,876
I just come.

1054
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:46,895
Why have you come here?
-My mother will die of thirst.

1055
01:43:46,975 --> 01:43:51,159
Please give me a glass of water.
-Get lost!

1056
01:43:54,983 --> 01:44:00,231
You?!...What do you want?
- Please give me a glass of water.

1057
01:44:00,311 --> 01:44:02,477
Do I want to get myself
killed by giving you water?

1058
01:44:02,557 --> 01:44:03,764
Get lost.
- Listen.

1059
01:44:04,048 --> 01:44:11,176
Please give me only one glass of water!
Please give me some water.

1060
01:44:30,972 --> 01:44:35,136
Mother, I have got water
for you, please drink.

1061
01:44:35,496 --> 01:44:39,569
Mother, please drink.

1062
01:44:40,311 --> 01:44:46,311
Mother, please drink.

1063
01:44:46,391 --> 01:44:50,160
Mother! Mother! Mother!

1064
01:45:00,718 --> 01:45:03,891
Doctor, please open
the door, quickly!

1065
01:45:04,829 --> 01:45:09,700
Doctor, my mother is very ill,
please come with me!

1066
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:12,711
I don't want to spoil my health
by curing your mother.

1067
01:45:12,791 --> 01:45:13,735
Please don't say that.

1068
01:45:13,815 --> 01:45:18,841
Didn't Bhaiji say that whoever
helps you will also be in trouble!

1069
01:45:18,921 --> 01:45:21,873
Please doctor.
- Please excuse me, you go inside!

1070
01:45:21,953 --> 01:45:25,688
Please, doctor!
- Please, go away.

1071
01:46:20,505 --> 01:46:23,701
Mother!

1072
01:46:27,817 --> 01:46:29,570
Mother!

1073
01:46:35,526 --> 01:46:39,728
Today is the seventh day and
as per my promise, I am here.

1074
01:46:39,808 --> 01:46:43,818
Open the door, Sapna.

1075
01:46:49,639 --> 01:46:51,190
The poor girl is scared.

1076
01:47:00,138 --> 01:47:04,168
Leave me you scoundrel, if
something happens to my sister today...

1077
01:47:04,757 --> 01:47:06,350
then I will not spare
Bhaiji and you!

1078
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:09,511
I will burn the entire world!

1079
01:47:11,769 --> 01:47:16,007
Bhaiji and your sister
must be on fire at the moment.

1080
01:47:16,293 --> 01:47:18,523
Today is the seventh day!

1081
01:47:18,991 --> 01:47:22,010
And Bhaiji keeps his word.

1082
01:47:39,684 --> 01:47:42,294
When I promise to love...

1083
01:47:42,896 --> 01:47:44,903
the girls commit suicide.

1084
01:47:50,573 --> 01:47:52,367
She was a nice girl!

1085
01:48:24,364 --> 01:48:27,353
'Mother,
you blame brother unnecessarily.'

1086
01:48:27,433 --> 01:48:29,254
'I am proud of my brother.'

1087
01:48:29,334 --> 01:48:32,506
'Till brother is there
no one can do us harm.'

1088
01:48:44,285 --> 01:48:46,239
'Arjun, is something
happens to you..

1089
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:48,576
..what will happen to this old
mother and your sister?'

1090
01:50:40,484 --> 01:50:44,417
Rascal, don't you dare touch my daughter!
- Papa.

1091
01:50:44,497 --> 01:50:46,455
Very good, Mohite!

1092
01:50:46,889 --> 01:50:49,786
I am glad that you got both,
the father and the daughter.

1093
01:50:50,327 --> 01:50:53,152
Now this imbecile will
tell me where Arjun is.

1094
01:50:57,189 --> 01:51:03,291
Commissioner, we got your hands
cut but yet, you did not learn?

1095
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:11,204
Now I will do what I could not
do with Arjun's sister.

1096
01:51:11,284 --> 01:51:15,727
Before that, Arjun will do something
which has never happened before.

1097
01:51:15,941 --> 01:51:18,061
He will wipe out your existence
from the face of this earth!

1098
01:51:23,034 --> 01:51:27,271
He will wipe out my existence?

1099
01:51:28,192 --> 01:51:30,717
I will kill that scoundrel today itself!

1100
01:51:30,890 --> 01:51:35,185
You cannot kill him.
Nobody can kill Arjun!

1101
01:51:35,992 --> 01:51:39,796
He is like a volcano and
the day that volcano erupts...

1102
01:51:39,982 --> 01:51:42,707
it will blow criminals
like you into smithereens.

1103
01:51:53,230 --> 01:51:59,341
I never thought that I would taint
such a beautiful girl like you!

1104
01:51:59,820 --> 01:52:04,069
Today, I will burn you in my fire!

1105
01:52:04,149 --> 01:52:05,755
Bhaiji!

1106
01:52:05,835 --> 01:52:08,676
This fink always
comes at the wrong time!

1107
01:52:09,247 --> 01:52:10,112
What is the matter?

1108
01:52:10,192 --> 01:52:16,293
I told you that Kamble was eying
my chair and was trying to get it.

1109
01:52:16,467 --> 01:52:21,076
And that's what is happening,
he is going to the High Command...

1110
01:52:21,156 --> 01:52:23,161
and my chair is going to topple!

1111
01:52:23,241 --> 01:52:24,612
So what can I do?

1112
01:52:25,032 --> 01:52:29,827
Before he topples my chair,
you kill him.

1113
01:52:30,891 --> 01:52:35,055
What will you give me if I kill him?

1114
01:52:35,135 --> 01:52:37,996
I will give you 2.5 million.

1115
01:52:38,428 --> 01:52:40,774
That amount is not enough
to even make me feel good!

1116
01:52:42,330 --> 01:52:45,954
Okay 5 million!
-I want a crate!

1117
01:52:46,287 --> 01:52:49,704
What do you mean by that?

1118
01:52:49,784 --> 01:52:51,812
10 million.
-10 million?!

1119
01:52:51,892 --> 01:52:55,239
In underworld lingo,
a crate means 10 millions!

1120
01:52:56,396 --> 01:53:04,856
Alright, I will give you
10 millions...1 crate!!

1121
01:53:05,753 --> 01:53:07,213
Bhaiji!

1122
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:18,407
Arjun!

1123
01:53:33,547 --> 01:53:37,906
Never play with fire,
water and Bhaiji.

1124
01:53:38,301 --> 01:53:43,747
Fire burns, water drowns
and Bhaiji tortures!

1125
01:53:43,827 --> 01:53:49,825
"No...no!!"

1126
01:54:06,239 --> 01:54:11,465
"I have kept my heart
at your feet..."

1127
01:54:11,545 --> 01:54:17,076
"look at me and embrace me"

1128
01:54:17,283 --> 01:54:22,181
"look at me and embrace me"

1129
01:54:22,261 --> 01:54:30,343
"I have dedicated my youth
in your name, look at me"

1130
01:54:30,423 --> 01:54:33,232
"and embrace me"

1131
01:54:33,794 --> 01:54:40,654
"I have kept my heart
at your feet..."

1132
01:54:52,294 --> 01:54:58,190
"There is a big gap
between you and me..."

1133
01:54:58,270 --> 01:55:04,012
"but, if we decide to meet,
nobody can stop us"

1134
01:55:06,567 --> 01:55:09,337
"You're a cute and a sweet girl."

1135
01:55:09,417 --> 01:55:13,790
"Glaring at you isn't
robbery or stealing."

1136
01:55:13,870 --> 01:55:18,022
"10 million, Bhaiji"

1137
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:23,830
"There is a big gap
between you and me..."

1138
01:55:24,027 --> 01:55:28,882
"If we decide in our hearts,
then what are these obstacles."

1139
01:55:28,962 --> 01:55:34,541
"Nothing is difficult for us"

1140
01:55:34,621 --> 01:55:40,529
"look at me and embrace me"

1141
01:55:40,609 --> 01:55:47,284
"I have kept my heart
at your feet..."

1142
01:56:04,308 --> 01:56:09,896
"There are thousand
emotions in your eyes..."

1143
01:56:09,976 --> 01:56:16,276
"there are several
desires within me too"

1144
01:56:18,666 --> 01:56:21,247
"Whatever is yours
is mine too, dear."

1145
01:56:21,327 --> 01:56:23,977
"We share it equally, brother."

1146
01:56:24,410 --> 01:56:26,914
"What's the delay when
the damsel is here?"

1147
01:56:26,994 --> 01:56:29,873
"10 million, Bhaiji"

1148
01:56:30,324 --> 01:56:35,905
"There are thousand
emotions in your eyes..."

1149
01:56:35,985 --> 01:56:41,010
"there are several
desires within me too"

1150
01:56:41,090 --> 01:56:46,368
"No matter what
the consequences are"

1151
01:56:46,448 --> 01:56:52,038
"look at me and embrace me"

1152
01:56:52,557 --> 01:56:57,800
"I have kept my heart
at your feet..."

1153
01:56:57,880 --> 01:57:03,337
"look at me and embrace me"

1154
01:57:04,099 --> 01:57:10,716
"I have kept my heart
at your feet..."

1155
01:57:13,070 --> 01:57:21,764
"We have come for you girl.
We are all here waiting for you."

1156
01:57:24,392 --> 01:57:29,788
"The loafers are enjoying
and having fun."

1157
01:57:29,868 --> 01:57:33,331
"The clowns are hitting the walls."

1158
01:57:35,732 --> 01:57:41,227
"Babli and Badal are swinging.
Bijli and bulbul are dancing around."

1159
01:57:41,307 --> 01:57:46,931
"I sing container, container,
Bhaiji container."

1160
01:57:49,417 --> 01:57:54,799
"The snake charmer
makes you dance."

1161
01:57:54,879 --> 01:57:57,980
"The music goes on and on."

1162
01:57:58,060 --> 01:58:01,491
"Container, container, my container."

1163
01:58:03,730 --> 01:58:09,157
"Round and round like a hanging rope."

1164
01:58:09,237 --> 01:58:11,925
"Container,
container, Bhaiji container."

1165
01:58:12,005 --> 01:58:14,720
"Container,
container, Bhaiji container."

1166
01:58:22,119 --> 01:58:27,052
Bhaiji, 10 million!

1167
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:30,235
Container, container.

1168
01:58:30,629 --> 01:58:31,855
Come with me!

1169
01:58:32,238 --> 01:58:33,319
Bhaiji.

1170
01:58:51,153 --> 01:58:53,809
You scoundrels! Let go of Deepa!

1171
01:58:53,889 --> 01:58:56,863
I will kill you!

1172
01:58:57,093 --> 01:58:58,985
You idiot.

1173
01:59:03,053 --> 01:59:03,833
Father.

1174
01:59:03,913 --> 01:59:05,503
Sir, why did you do this?
- Father.

1175
01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:07,527
Father.

1176
01:59:07,607 --> 01:59:08,760
Shoot him!

1177
01:59:24,321 --> 01:59:25,537
No.

1178
01:59:36,394 --> 01:59:38,016
Sir.
- Father.

1179
01:59:55,727 --> 01:59:57,670
Don't cry, Deepa.

1180
02:01:56,093 --> 02:02:00,269
Where is your Bhaiji,
tell me you fink?

1181
02:02:00,349 --> 02:02:03,067
At Saki Naka's dockyard.

1182
02:02:06,049 --> 02:02:10,632
Bhaiji, he killed them both!

1183
02:02:10,712 --> 02:02:13,262
Now he will come and get us too.

1184
02:02:14,558 --> 02:02:17,662
If you talk more, 
I will shoot you before he reaches here!

1185
02:02:18,873 --> 02:02:21,909
Bhaiji, what will you
achieve by killing me?

1186
02:02:22,167 --> 02:02:25,926
If you have to kill someone
then kill that Arjun Singh!

1187
02:02:26,496 --> 02:02:29,236
Or else, he will kill both of us!

1188
02:02:35,553 --> 02:02:41,241
You wait and see how I torture
that rascal and put him to death!

1189
02:02:48,772 --> 02:02:49,621
Hello.

1190
02:02:49,701 --> 02:02:51,607
Yes, Arjun.
- Have you arranged for the car?

1191
02:02:52,066 --> 02:02:54,687
Yes, it is. 
-Is everything done as per the plan?

1192
02:02:55,008 --> 02:02:56,430
The timing should be correct.

1193
02:02:56,747 --> 02:02:57,824
Okay.

1194
02:03:01,723 --> 02:03:04,095
I found out where
that Arjun Singh is hiding.

1195
02:03:04,379 --> 02:03:10,947
I will not let this battle of Arjun
Singh and Bhaiji continue for long!

1196
02:03:12,419 --> 02:03:18,229
He is hiding in the Raymond complex,
take the police force there.

1197
02:03:19,602 --> 02:03:24,427
And apprehend that
obsessed Arjun Singh!

1198
02:03:40,867 --> 02:03:45,436
The police force has besieged you!

1199
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:49,194
If you want your safety then
surrender yourself to the police.

1200
02:03:49,584 --> 02:03:51,521
Until I don't kill Bhaiji...

1201
02:03:51,838 --> 02:03:54,285
I will not surrender
myself to the police.

1202
02:03:54,365 --> 02:03:58,094
Then I will be
compelled to shoot you!

1203
02:03:58,174 --> 02:04:01,106
Inspector,
I have no enmity with the police...

1204
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:05,195
you are my fellow mates, 
I don't wish to shoot any one of you!

1205
02:04:05,533 --> 02:04:07,262
Move from my path!

1206
02:04:08,384 --> 02:04:10,749
Stop the firing.

1207
02:04:24,221 --> 02:04:27,872
Arjun Singh, 
don't take the law in your hands.

1208
02:04:28,054 --> 02:04:29,458
Surrender yourself!

1209
02:04:29,538 --> 02:04:33,522
I will surrender myself but, only
after I kill that monster, Bhaiji!

1210
02:04:39,774 --> 02:04:40,771
Dharam.

1211
02:04:40,851 --> 02:04:50,859
Don't worry about me, Arjun...
just destroy that Bhaiji!

1212
02:04:52,528 --> 02:04:58,260
No, Dharam!

1213
02:05:07,219 --> 02:05:09,161
Stop that firing.
- Hold the firing.

1214
02:05:11,072 --> 02:05:15,089
Inspector, you all wait here.
- Yes, sir.

1215
02:05:39,497 --> 02:05:43,785
Ask them to throw their weapons.
-No, inspector! Shoot him!

1216
02:05:44,123 --> 02:05:48,934
Don't worry about me,
you shoot him!

1217
02:05:49,014 --> 02:05:50,943
Fire.

1218
02:06:20,361 --> 02:06:24,537
Sir, it had become necessary for me
to take the law in my hands.

1219
02:06:25,276 --> 02:06:28,937
Because, law does not only give
justice but, protection too!

1220
02:06:30,228 --> 02:06:34,515
And today, I will show the true
face of law to the lady of justice!

1221
02:06:59,099 --> 02:07:02,617
He will not spare us,
he will kill us too!

1222
02:07:03,739 --> 02:07:09,353
He is obsessed! Run out
and close the doors!

1223
02:07:10,086 --> 02:07:14,750
You go and shut the windows!
He may appear from the roof too!

1224
02:07:14,891 --> 02:07:19,157
Where should I hide?
I will hide in the bathroom!

1225
02:07:19,237 --> 02:07:21,631
But sir, you have to attend
a party meeting now.

1226
02:07:21,898 --> 02:07:25,766
Fool, if I am alive,
I can attend several meetings!

1227
02:07:25,902 --> 02:07:29,099
But if you don't go now,
your position will be in danger!

1228
02:07:29,239 --> 02:07:32,766
My position will be in danger?
O God, what should I do now?

1229
02:07:32,909 --> 02:07:35,434
O Gandhiji, please guide me,...

1230
02:07:35,579 --> 02:07:38,143
one side is the danger of
position and on other is my death!

1231
02:07:38,359 --> 02:07:39,971
Now you just have a death threat...

1232
02:07:40,358 --> 02:07:44,080
but, if you lose your position,
the public will beat you to death!

1233
02:07:44,899 --> 02:07:51,276
No, I cannot give up my position!

1234
02:07:51,550 --> 02:07:55,837
I will surely go. Make sure
all the streets are empty!

1235
02:07:56,217 --> 02:08:02,467
I want a police convoy
all around me!

1236
02:08:03,677 --> 02:08:07,098
Arjun Singh!!

1237
02:08:27,117 --> 02:08:33,409
Hey! Stop the car!

1238
02:08:37,991 --> 02:08:39,558
Madam, don't stop your car here.

1239
02:08:39,638 --> 02:08:43,956
My car has stopped, please help me.
-Hey! Push the car.

1240
02:09:11,475 --> 02:09:13,512
Drive faster!

1241
02:09:18,443 --> 02:09:21,019
Come on, drive faster!

1242
02:09:32,846 --> 02:09:36,668
I will give you a reward,
drive faster!

1243
02:09:44,506 --> 02:09:45,715
Idiot! Drive faster!

1244
02:09:51,748 --> 02:09:54,409
Come on, hurry up!

1245
02:12:25,268 --> 02:12:28,263
Where is Arjun Singh?
-I don't know!

1246
02:12:28,795 --> 02:12:31,787
Okay, we will have to check
your car...constable!

1247
02:12:40,322 --> 02:12:43,174
Sorry for the trouble, madam. You can go.
- Thank you.

1248
02:13:00,650 --> 02:13:03,078
Arjun.

1249
02:13:13,565 --> 02:13:17,297
Deepa, quickly remove the bullet!

1250
02:13:18,886 --> 02:13:19,797
Hurry up!

1251
02:13:30,288 --> 02:13:33,577
That Arjun Singh killed
a minister in public.

1252
02:13:34,267 --> 02:13:35,871
And you all could not do anything?

1253
02:13:36,590 --> 02:13:41,340
Now, I will have to do
something to arrest him!

1254
02:15:23,217 --> 02:15:31,227
Didn't I tell you, don't play with fire,
water and Bhaiji!

1255
02:15:35,175 --> 02:15:37,375
Kill the scoundrel!

1256
02:15:41,767 --> 02:15:43,878
Hit him more!

1257
02:15:53,052 --> 02:15:54,604
Kill the rascal!

1258
02:15:54,684 --> 02:15:56,984
Bhaiji, your tame dogs
cannot harm me!

1259
02:15:57,320 --> 02:16:01,336
Let's see how much they can hit
and how much I can endure?

1260
02:16:01,416 --> 02:16:04,606
Come on, hit me!

1261
02:19:05,239 --> 02:19:06,633
Constables, catch him.

1262
02:19:07,646 --> 02:19:10,439
No!!
-Take him away!

1263
02:19:10,728 --> 02:19:16,876
Come.
- Leave me...No!

1264
02:19:17,528 --> 02:19:24,367
No!! Leave me!!

1265
02:19:24,641 --> 02:19:28,279
I will kill that rogue!

1266
02:19:28,674 --> 02:19:31,640
Leave me, I say!

1267
02:19:32,052 --> 02:19:36,368
I will not spare you, Bhaiji!

1268
02:19:36,677 --> 02:19:38,112
Handcuff him!

1269
02:19:39,147 --> 02:19:41,759
Move away.
- Bhaiji.
