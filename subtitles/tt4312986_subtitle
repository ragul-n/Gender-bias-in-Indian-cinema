Uttam Kumar, Suchitra Sen

3
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,280
From the above mentioned address
it's clear to you..

4
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,000
That I've shifted to a new address.

5
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,280
For me changing houses has become..

6
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,599
An of repeated action
like changing clothes.

7
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,319
I've resigned from job because..

8
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,599
The employers..

9
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,800
.Because the employers..

10
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:13,479
Have ill-intentions.

11
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,680
I've given up painting too because..

12
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,520
I don't have colour as..

13
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,000
I've to evade the money lenders.

14
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,759
Whenever I hear a knocking sound
at the door I startle.

15
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,519
Are you Ms. Shakuntala?

16
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,839
Greetings! I'm Rajnath.
Rajnath Samanta.

17
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,680
I'm the owner of the flat that
you left without paying rent.

18
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:25,920
Why did you leave suddenly?
Was the rent too much?

19
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,959
You could have informed
before leaving.

20
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,759
Then would you've let
me stay without rent?

21
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,920
Not really. I would've seen
that you could pay the rent.

22
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,879
How?

23
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,399
You're an artiste, right?

24
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,560
I've contacts with a few newspapers.

25
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,160
I could've made arrangements.

26
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,439
Now I can't do it.

27
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,040
I think, you'll go to any
lengths for your rent.

28
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,480
But, I can't leave this place now.

29
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,040
Come after a couple of days.

30
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,360
Few days later?

31
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,519
Well, I might come and see
you've left this place too.

32
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,439
So you've come to take the money?

33
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,439
What can I do? You see, we..

34
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,800
Never mind. I'll give
you your money.

35
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,879
Have you brought the receipt?

36
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:24,240
Receipt?

37
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,399
Check in your bag.

38
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,160
It's not in the bag.

39
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,240
In that case, you may leave.

40
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:44,240
If I come after a few days,
will I get the money?

41
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,240
What if you don't?

42
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,079
The courts will do it for me.

43
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,199
In that case, you can
go to the courts!

44
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:54,720
That I can.

45
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,000
But you really should consider
my proposition.

46
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,160
You may go scot-free but someone
else will be in a fix.

47
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:05,879
Bhaskardas Mallik. In whose name
the flat has been rented.

48
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,680
He will get the summons tomorrow.

49
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,560
Greetings!

50
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,439
Excuse me, can you send orders
for paintings here?

51
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,079
Live in my flat and the
orders will come there.

52
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,600
Oh yes!

53
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Oh, come in!

54
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,959
Why the hammer in hand?

55
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,000
This one? To teach you a lesson.

56
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,720
Who gave Mr. Rajnath my address?

57
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,879
Who else would know your
address besides me?

58
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,879
Stop kidding! Why did you
give him my address?

59
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,759
Couldn't help it.

60
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,279
The way he asked me, I thought
he might starve..

61
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,480
If he didn't get the rent.

62
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,759
So I told him.

63
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,079
I see. I'll tell Debu
everything today.

64
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,600
What's the point? He'll
gladly smack his student.

65
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,519
Good. I don't want to see
you ever again here.

66
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,399
You won't see me if I don't come.

67
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,696
Won't see me if I
don't come, indeed!

68
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,039
Why did you give him my address?

69
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,775
Oh dear! If I didn't tell him, he
would've complained against..

70
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,519
Me in court.

71
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,120
Now he'll complain against me!

72
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,879
Are you crazy?

73
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,720
A guy who can spend Rs. 200
to get Rs. 70 will never..

74
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,679
Complain. I can say that for sure.

75
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,919
- Are you my bride?
- What?

76
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,240
You're my bride?

77
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,440
I'm your bride! Okay, come
along, I'm your bride.

78
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,679
I'm your bride! Who taught you this?

79
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,720
- My grandfather.
- Grandfather?

80
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,360
Well, he is really something.

81
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,519
What is your name?

82
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,000
One is Babloo, another Dadu
and the third is Goon!

83
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,879
- The last one is perfect!
- Babloo!

84
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:38,320
Babloo! Babloo!

85
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,799
Have you come to take
your son? Come in.

86
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,960
He is so naughty. It's
hard keeping him in.

87
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,200
You've to watch what you say!

88
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,159
I don't like criticism
of my husband.

89
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,720
Tell me sweetie, who am I?

90
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,440
You're my bride.

91
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:06,399
Oh no! That's his grandfather's
training.

92
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:11,679
Speaks to him all day long about
his bride and spoils him.

93
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,639
But I must say, my son
has good choice.

94
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Are you new here?

95
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,600
Yes. We've been here
just a few days.

96
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,480
- Were you here earlier?
- Yes.

97
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,919
Okay, bye. He is waiting
at the table.

98
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,440
If I don't go he won't eat.

99
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,720
His father?

100
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,080
No, his grandfather. Why?

101
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,320
Just wanted to know.

102
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,240
I've seen all of you, but
not your husband, so..

103
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,399
He is away. Come Babloo.

104
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,960
You were so frightened.
Did it hurt much?

105
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,559
Your Highness, slept well?

106
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,320
I'm leaving, I'll be late returning.

107
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,120
I see. Have you visited aunt
in the past week or so?

108
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,399
Where was the time?

109
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,559
Oh, you were so very busy!

110
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,320
Please go today, she had called.

111
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,080
- I'm going to her place.
- Oh.

112
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,360
I'll be late. Don't wait
up till 1:00 a.m. now!

113
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,399
Okay, go now!

114
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,120
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

115
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:38,559
- May I come in?
- Come in.

116
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,480
Hope you're faring okay. I
should've checked earlier.

117
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
Why?

118
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,240
Your livelihood depends on
the atmosphere around you.

119
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,039
It's our duty to take
care of the same.

120
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,559
So you do check on your
tenants now and then.

121
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,240
I don't but I should. Just that.

122
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,399
No problem over here now but I
don't know about the future.

123
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,120
Your rent for 2 months.

124
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,159
I didn't expect the rent today.

125
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:27,840
Just as well. These are
hard times. Have a seat.

126
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,559
Do you've anything more to say?

127
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:35,120
Yes. I didn't come here
for the money exactly.

128
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,960
Earlier too you didn't
come for the money.

129
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,919
Neither will you do so
in the future, I know.

130
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,840
Meaning?

131
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,440
You're extremely well off,
it's common knowledge.

132
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,240
Drop the act and get to the point.

133
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,720
True. Let me tell you about myself.

134
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,399
I had no choice but to use
this devious method.

135
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,639
There was no other way
to get you back here.

136
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,519
What's your gain in
getting me back here?

137
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:16,679
Wonderful! Have you painted this?

138
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,320
I know you're upset.

139
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,440
Look, I didn't really think of
profit or loss in getting..

140
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,360
You back here. I just told
you what I aimed for.

141
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,320
I knew Bhaskar and I had
heard of you long back.

142
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,120
You don't know me and never have.

143
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,320
Do you've anything more to say?

144
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,720
Yes.

145
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,919
This is an invite from
a monthly publication.

146
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,000
They will pay well if
they like the painting.

147
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,840
I don't need that.

148
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,279
You may not need it, but we do.

149
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,679
One more thing, you'll have to
go to our club once in a while.

150
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,919
Why should I go to your club?

151
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,279
You've a wrong opinion of me,
I want to change that.

152
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,279
If you visit the club you'll
realize that we've more to..

153
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,559
Worry about than just
the basic necessities.

154
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,600
Who says you need to worry
about basic necessities?

155
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,759
I'm too caught up in my own affairs
to make time for all that.

156
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,679
This is your anger speaking.

157
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,120
Agreed. But why do I've
to visit your club?

158
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,360
You haven't told me that.

159
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,320
To get your sympathy.

160
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,559
Besides, when we meet famous
singers, writers or..

161
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,080
Painters, we force them to
visit us. Won't you come?

162
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,200
- No!
- Why?

163
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,000
Well, I'm pleased to hear your
reason for inviting me.

164
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,159
But I've long passed the stage
to get impressed with flattery.

165
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,879
No point going on, it's late
now. Please leave now.

166
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,759
I'll think about it later.

167
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,559
You'll think about it? Okay.

168
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:32,440
Oh yes, I'll visit again. Bye.

169
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,399
What's all this?

170
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,200
Explanations later. My hands
hurt!

171
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,720
Come in.

172
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,039
If I've a few mothers-in-law like
you, I'll never want for food!

173
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,399
What's new about this, Raju?

174
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,960
It's been 20 years now
I've problems sleeping.

175
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,440
From tomorrow, you've
to do as I say.

176
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,080
You don't realize how tired
you get toiling away all day.

177
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,399
I toil away so that I get tired.

178
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,879
At your age, you're not
expected to work so hard.

179
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,519
You can't manage it anymore.

180
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:40,159
Go out of station for few days.

181
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,879
Will you go?

182
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,840
Tell him that gentleman
has come to meet him.

183
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:47,840
No gentleman meets him.

184
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,600
Has he left?

185
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,039
He went the other way.

186
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,320
Did you recognize him?

187
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,559
Look behind and see who he is.

188
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,440
Baggage and all?

189
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,519
- Have you come straight from the station?
- Yes.

190
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,839
You said there was someone.
Is this him?

191
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,920
It's not his fault, brother. I
almost got caught in the lie.

192
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Shosha, get some piping hot
savouries and tea for brother.

193
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,160
- Give him the money.
- What?

194
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:42,440
No credit anymore.

195
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,720
Why didn't you let me know
of the complications there?

196
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,640
You've been there already?

197
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,160
In that case, you've
seen everything.

198
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,240
Now you take over and
let me out of this.

199
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,440
I can't keep hiding behind
closed doors anymore.

200
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,400
Can you do something? Then both
they and we get relief.

201
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
What?

202
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,640
You picked them from the streets.

203
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,079
Send them back there. They'll
at least get fresh air.

204
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,880
Bhaskar, don't talk like
a foolish, wise man..

205
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,720
I can't stand it.

206
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,960
I've read the letter at least
10 times since yesterday.

207
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,680
Think about it, I've spent so
many years just reading..

208
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:42,279
Letters from your son.

209
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,376
If I had studied further, in
the same time I'd have been..

210
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,759
A graduate today.

211
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:51,640
If your son goes abroad to study,
think how restless..

212
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,920
This old man will get.

213
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,255
If this is to be the state of
affairs, I'd rather not send my..

214
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,720
Son abroad.

215
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,759
I just can't read the letter
now, I'm cooking.

216
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,416
Grandpa, give me puffed rice.

217
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,880
- What?
- Puffed rice.

218
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,880
Puffed rice? Okay.

219
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,839
I'll give it to you.
Come dear. Come.

220
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,920
Here.

221
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,519
Are you upset with me?

222
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,759
Upset? Why?

223
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,720
I read your letter.

224
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,559
Not at all. I'm glad you
indulged the old man.

225
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,279
What are you thinking?

226
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,279
Oh just, whether I've added
salt to my dish here.

227
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,799
As if you can think about it.

228
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,960
- How's Shuku?
- Good.

229
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,640
What's up, is she fine?

230
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:56,799
Why not? She's got a good
place to live in.

231
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,960
A young husband.

232
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,519
Besides, rich folks
visit her everyday.

233
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:07,160
No point in my telling you.
Go take a look for yourself.

234
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,200
Shuku has married? When?

235
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,799
How do I know? I just found out.

236
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,559
What was that about rich folk?

237
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:27,240
He visits. Although he hasn't
cut much ice with her.

238
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,240
Brother, he is a patron of the arts.

239
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,319
He was so impressed with one
of Shuku's paintings..

240
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,599
That he immediately paid Rs. 2000.

241
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,200
What's Shuku's address?

242
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,799
I'll take you there.

243
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,319
What did you say? A Libran? Oh.

244
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,680
Finances will be good but due
to certain circumstances..

245
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:52,119
Your money matters
won't be stable.

246
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,559
Though you will find satisfaction
and fame in work..

247
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,640
You'll be restless. Things
look up on the home front.

248
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,240
How about neighbours?

249
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,759
There is like-mindedness there.

250
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,240
Health is good but your mental
state might interfere with..

251
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:11,359
- A cause of concern.
- Ok.

252
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,359
You mean to say those who
are under this star..

253
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,680
- Does Ms. Shakuntala Roy live here?
- You are...?

254
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,440
I'm her relative.

255
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,319
I don't think she mentioned
any relative.

256
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,599
You're not supposed to know.
And who are you?

257
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,160
Me?

258
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,400
I'm her grandfather-in-law.

259
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,599
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

260
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,200
Take these stairs, if you find
the door on the right shut..

261
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:49,720
Enter the left hand side room.

262
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,279
You'll find her chatting
with her mother-in-law.

263
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,440
Okay.

264
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,640
You get married and all!

265
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,279
I thought, I..

266
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,839
I didn't ask you what you think.
Whom do you want to meet?

267
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,440
Ms. Shakuntala.

268
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,680
She isn't in, wait in the
living room downstairs.

269
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:47,720
Okay, I'm really very sorry.

270
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,640
The old gentleman downstairs
said she would be here so..

271
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,000
Shakuntala is a distant
cousin of mine.

272
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,640
Bye.

273
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,640
Excuse me, are you Mr. Debkamal?

274
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,599
Yes. I have never visited
here before this.

275
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,640
Please wait here, she'll
be here anytime now.

276
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,839
Her room is shut.

277
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,136
It's okay, I'll wait downstairs.

278
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,480
No, please sit here. I've heard
of you but not seen you..

279
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,759
What an embarrassing
situation we got into!

280
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,839
Come in. Sit.

281
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,400
- Doesn't Shakuntala know you'll be coming today?
- No.

282
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:30,720
Is she used to getting
smacks from you?

283
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,039
You were asking about her marriage.

284
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,119
I mean.

285
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,559
I see, did you see the grandson?

286
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:41,880
No, is he here?

287
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,079
He was right next to
the old gentleman.

288
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,599
Hey brother, you! How long
have you been here?

289
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,400
I don't get it. Are
you coming or going?

290
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,799
Enough of the sweet talk, I've
been waiting for half an hour.

291
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,279
You're alright, I see.
Sipping tea and all.

292
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
No..

293
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,920
Actually, I was heating water
anyway for my back..

294
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:17,559
So I made a cup of tea for him.

295
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,119
What's wrong with your back?

296
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,640
I think I've broken
a bone or something.

297
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,720
You see, I, I.. Let's go to
your room, I'll tell you.

298
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:33,400
Hardly have you come here
and you worry about..

299
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,440
The mission.

300
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:39,200
Money, money, money! You'll
go mad someday.

301
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,839
You know since childhood, what
it is not to have that.

302
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,119
When did you paint that?

303
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,559
After you left.

304
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,440
It seems some big shot is totally..

305
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,480
Impressed with the painting.

306
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,000
Who told you?

307
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,279
I met Bhaskar, remember?

308
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,519
Brother, I think he needs
to be reined in.

309
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,599
Earlier, such people were
afraid to come near you.

310
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,039
What's up?

311
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,400
What do you think?

312
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:25,119
Hasn't he been snubbed by you?

313
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,839
He has, several times.

314
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,160
He comes here and gets
snubbed time and again.

315
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:34,920
Once I thought, I'd give
him the painting.

316
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,160
Then I thought, what's the point?

317
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,839
It will lie under his bed.

318
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:47,200
And he will probably
discover art in me.

319
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,480
Next time, I'll ask him what
the painting means to him.

320
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:00,799
Who's this?

321
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,359
Hey, come in. You're his
elder brother-in-law.

322
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,039
Really?! You put me
in a real quandary.

323
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,039
You would've been in
prison, you know.

324
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:24,240
Not bad. First he is busy with
his wife and now he gets..

325
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,559
Elder brother-in-law for company!

326
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,799
I say, do you guys
want to eat or not?

327
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,400
If he doesn't want to eat,
why force the poor guy?

328
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:36,559
Take him as your disciple, it
will be good for the country.

329
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,160
I didn't get that. Do
I serve the country?

330
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,559
May be not. But you're a
saviour of the orphans.

331
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,400
- Saviour?
- Aren't you?

332
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:56,720
No.

333
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,440
Then what are you?

334
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,400
- I'm only concerned about them.
- Really?

335
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,480
You folks make fun of it, I know.

336
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,880
But I speak the truth.

337
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,359
Shakuntala is an artiste, she has
forgotten her childhood days.

338
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,359
I haven't.

339
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,160
My mother was compelled to take
refuge at Shakuntala's home.

340
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:30,200
I don't know why. I don't know
where we came from either.

341
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,920
Shakuntala's father was an artiste.

342
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,559
May be, that is why we got
shelter with him that day.

343
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,920
Shakuntala's mother
died at her birth.

344
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,319
My mother brought us up like
siblings, but not for long.

345
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,680
My mother expired, a few days
later, Shakuntala's father too.

346
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,599
Both siblings were almost
reduced to penury.

347
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,680
We sold Shakuntala's father's
paintings walking streets..

348
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:09,440
After streets at whatever
price we got for them.

349
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,799
Shakuntala got refuge
with the missionaries.

350
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:20,680
I too got a shelter. Bhaskar
lived there too.

351
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,480
One day, Bhaskar came and told
me, the shelter owners..

352
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,119
Were planning to blind me.

353
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:29,799
It would be a good source of income.

354
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,880
I was just 12 then, caught
up in all kinds of fears.

355
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,599
Fearing for myself I ran away
that night. Bhaskar and me.

356
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:47,799
I can't tell you what all
we did just to survive.

357
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:51,799
A person with a history like
this can hardly think of..

358
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,640
Serving the nation.

359
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,720
Ever since, all I've desired
for is just one thing.

360
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,400
Wealth, immense wealth.

361
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,240
If I ever get that someday,
you can certainly make your..

362
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:14,519
Son my disciple. I won't object.

363
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,279
Come in.

364
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,719
Have a seat, Shakuntala
will be here any moment.

365
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:40,960
You are?

366
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,359
You don't know me.

367
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:47,920
I haven't seen you here before,
that's why I ask.

368
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,799
I wasn't here before.

369
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,920
Are you related to Ms. Shakuntala?

370
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,880
I'm Debkamal, you could
say I'm a relative.

371
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,680
Ms. Shakuntala was mentioning
that she will visit..

372
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,799
Your club someday soon.

373
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:09,039
Oh. That's a relief.

374
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,279
Here.

375
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:14,119
No, thank you!

376
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:21,480
You're Shakuntala's elder
brother, isn't it?

377
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,559
I believe you are in the
pharmaceutical business.

378
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,200
You're wrong. That is a worthless
proposition as far..

379
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,039
As earning goes.

380
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:37,000
My real work is going door to door.

381
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:40,440
That doesn't sound like
very good business.

382
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,759
What do I say to that?

383
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,319
I don't think there is
anything bad about it.

384
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,079
That is so far, right? How
can you depend on that?

385
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:54,799
Hey come in!

386
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,880
You were late coming, we've
introduced ourselves.

387
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,960
He relieved me by informing me
about your visiting our club.

388
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,880
- Now if you could relieve me on his front.
- How's that?

389
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,640
No it's just that the boys at
the club wanted to organise..

390
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,799
Something.

391
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,735
Since you're quite experienced
in the field..

392
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,960
Thought you might
show them the way.

393
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:17,079
Does it exclude you?

394
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:22,839
No. I act on whims too.

395
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,960
Okay, I assure you on
Shakuntala's behalf.

396
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,640
You talk of leading the
way, how can I lead?

397
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,880
Actually my destination
is just the opposite.

398
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,160
To observe wealthy people like
you and learn their ways..

399
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,119
In great detail.

400
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,440
Then try to achieve the
same in a bigger way.

401
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,640
I've observed something.
I feel that even today.

402
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,960
The ones you should befriend,
you seem to antagonise..

403
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:58,480
Them at the very outset. Isn't it?

404
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,279
A complex issue? Can't
seem to solve it.

405
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,839
Sounds good though.

406
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,920
It looks like you've come very
well prepared for this.

407
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,240
You're right, you know.

408
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,480
But you do agree, following
something positive can only..

409
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,000
End in good results.

410
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,880
- Can you play any string instrument?
- No.

411
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,440
Neither can I?

412
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,960
But I do know, if the training is
not right, the most beautiful..

413
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,079
Instrument can sound all wrong.

414
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,240
In fact, the strings can even break.

415
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,480
That's exactly what you're
trying to say here.

416
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,240
It's good to empathies with the rich
but not to try and emulate them.

417
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,079
Isn't it?

418
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:56,480
Excuse me, I must finish
these letters.

419
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:59,440
We'll be there at the right time.

420
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:02,440
Thanks a million!

421
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,599
Are you displeased if I come here?

422
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,319
If you don't get it, better not ask.

423
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,880
Oh yes, the money for two
of your paintings and..

424
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,680
A letter from the monthly
publication. They were with me.

425
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,400
Do the publishers think
your home is my address?

426
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:40,599
No. I'm the one who arranged
it, that's why.

427
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,440
May I know the reason?

428
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Reason? That's the only excuse
I have of coming here.

429
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:01,839
Do you like the painting?

430
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,480
Yes.

431
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,279
You can take it if you want.

432
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,159
I like the painter more
than the painting.

433
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,000
If you can tire of her too
and hand her over to me..

434
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,800
I can willingly take her home.

435
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,239
Mr. Rajnath!

436
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,280
See, what a fix you are in,
if you evade answering.

437
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,679
You knew the answer all along.

438
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,519
"When the attachment breaks,
there is great pain."

439
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,280
"The melody does not come together."

440
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,239
"Amidst all the turmoil and unrest
when a little blossom..

441
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,800
Comes apart."

442
00:34:52,880 --> 00:35:00,360
"Yet, in all this, please
stay with me, be mine."

443
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:08,440
"Yet, in all this, please
stay with me, be mine."

444
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,719
Come in. I was wondering
if you'd come.

445
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,719
However worthless something
may seem, there is always..

446
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:29,400
Something worthy hidden in it.

447
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:35,400
For when the dishonourable
receive something, they..

448
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:43,000
Certainly feel extreme gratitude
towards the giver.

449
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:45,960
How do you come to understand..

450
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,559
Such deep matters?

451
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,760
I told you, a certain respectable
institution has..

452
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,480
Wizened me beyond my years.

453
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,199
Why do you carry this
onerous burden?

454
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:09,480
See, you seem to have come
to many assumptions..

455
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:15,440
On your own. If all these were
true it would be impossible to live.

456
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:18,679
Who told you all men live?

457
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,199
Can you tell me something?

458
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,519
Life is an endless burden for
the needy and impoverished.

459
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,320
And they carry on grudgingly,
who made you believe this?

460
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:37,880
When I started the institute I
automatically came to know of this.

461
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:44,880
Does that mean you don't want
the institute to exist?

462
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,760
We want it to exist. We sincerely
want it to carry on..

463
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,320
That's why it's so difficult.

464
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,320
What's the name of the
mission you were in..

465
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,880
As a child?

466
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,840
Sharadamoyi Orphanage.

467
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,400
Why? Do you want to
check out the facts?

468
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:15,119
I just might do that! You'll
visit us now and then.

469
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,480
Why, you're at it again!

470
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,159
I'm feeling a little unwell.

471
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:59,679
I thought I might take
some and get sleep.

472
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,239
So much all at once?

473
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:08,599
Don't try to be my doctor
now. I'm used to it.

474
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:10,679
Let's see.

475
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,480
If I don't take this much,
it will be like..

476
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:14,920
Pricking myself for nothing.

477
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,880
Are you upset?

478
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,559
No, you're the big doctor here.

479
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,400
I'm ignorant since I couldn't
get my doctor's degree.

480
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:35,519
You've only yourself to blame.

481
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,559
Who will accept you as a doctor?

482
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:49,159
Go to bed. It's rather late.

483
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:48,920
'Rajnath, will it be fine?
Promise me.'

484
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,280
'Don't worry.'

485
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,519
'Are you crazy?'

486
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,599
'Do you know how it'll end?'

487
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,519
'Yes.'

488
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,199
'Rajnath, don't be silly. Why
take someone else's blame..

489
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,559
On yourself?'

490
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:03,679
'Save me, Rajnath!'

491
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,440
'Listen to me, Rajnath!' 'Rajnath!'

492
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:06,360
'Listen, Rajnath!'

493
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,840
'Rajnath, where are you going?'

494
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:20,960
Shuku, Harnath Samanta is
not a bad man, you know.

495
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:25,000
He is quite crazy but
he is a famous doctor.

496
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:29,320
Naturally, when he sends his
car for you, he will be..

497
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,880
Good and famous.

498
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:33,360
Are you jealous?

499
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,960
No, I'm just a little worried about
your attraction to the rich.

500
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:43,920
Shakuntala, you must help me.

501
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:45,920
Father seems to be quite ill.

502
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:47,559
You tell me now?!

503
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,840
We offered so many times,
you didn't let us help.

504
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:55,760
I'm sorry. I can't manage alone now.

505
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,639
If you could get me a good doctor.

506
00:40:58,719 --> 00:40:59,880
I'll leave right away.

507
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:08,159
Daughter-in-law, why hasn't
sonny arrived yet?

508
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,800
- No letter even?
- No father.

509
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,280
No letter today, we'll certainly
get one tomorrow.

510
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,320
We must send a telegram tomorrow.

511
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:39,336
If he doesn't come immediately,
it'll be difficult..

512
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,119
To control things here.

513
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:43,519
I've done it.

514
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:09,239
Does Ms. Shakuntala Ray live there?

515
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:12,199
Yes, but she has gone out.

516
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,159
Okay.

517
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:22,840
- What is it?
- You are?

518
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:24,320
I'm her elder brother.

519
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,920
Oh.

520
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,360
Excuse me,

521
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:40,599
please give her these.

522
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:48,719
And tell her, that these two
had come to me exactly..

523
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:50,760
In this manner one day.

524
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,599
Listen!

525
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Are you absolutely clear about
what you've said and written?

526
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,159
Bye!

527
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:25,440
Have you heard the good news?

528
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:29,119
How will I, if you don't tell me?

529
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:34,360
I had no idea the Samantas
had so much money.

530
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,639
I could figure out only after
visiting them several times.

531
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,679
What's the good news in this?

532
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
They can give us Rs. 5,000,000
to Rs. 6,000,000..

533
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:44,639
Very easily anytime.

534
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,960
They have 5 to 7 homes in Kolkata.

535
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:50,880
What is that to you?

536
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,440
And this successful
business to top that.

537
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:56,159
He is famous all over Bengal.

538
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,800
Why are you beating around the bush?

539
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,719
Come right out with
what you've to say.

540
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,976
Are you really so dense that you
don't get what I'm trying..

541
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,880
To say here?

542
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,976
Has it ever occurred to you
how many people can be..

543
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,920
Settled with this kind of money?

544
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:11,960
What is the use of thinking
all this rubbish?

545
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:14,119
Everything. You must marry Rajnath.

546
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,360
Are you out of your mind?

547
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,320
I don't know. But
marry him you must.

548
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,639
It's a mistake.

549
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,599
I don't like jokes.
You'll do as I say.

550
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,320
What is your objection, may I know?

551
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,840
I don't know about that.

552
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,639
But any woman will
do for Mr. Rajnath.

553
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,599
No need for me in that place.

554
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:36,719
How will you spend your life?
Just painting and teaching?

555
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:41,400
I don't know, brother.

556
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:51,880
But if I do find a home where..

557
00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:00,400
I'm truly needed, I'll
go most willingly.

558
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:03,760
And

559
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:13,400
if I don't meet someone like
that, I'll spend the rest..

560
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,440
Of my life the way I have
spent my 25 years so far.

561
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,360
Why did you suggest
this all of a sudden?

562
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,159
Why? Do you think I'm a little boy?

563
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,800
Rajnath has limitless wealth.

564
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,575
He has always managed to get
whomever or whatever..

565
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:36,880
He has fancied on strength
of that wealth.

566
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:39,519
Shuku, he deserves to be punished.

567
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,800
And I think you're the one who
can teach him that lesson.

568
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:45,719
Your anger is misplaced, brother.

569
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:47,800
He alone is not to blame.

570
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,639
And even if he deserves punishment,
I'm not foolish..

571
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,280
Enough to punish myself
for life in the process.

572
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,000
But this is not what you
really want, is it?

573
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,400
You just eye his wealth.

574
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,880
So far, we've no proof
of his being a bad man.

575
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,760
Haven't you?

576
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,639
No. At least another 100
people must have said..

577
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,920
In their hearts what
he told me so easily.

578
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,119
They didn't have the courage
and he has a surplus of that.

579
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,000
Of course, if his courage
crosses limits I too can..

580
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:29,000
Answer him in kind.

581
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,519
You can rest assured of that.

582
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,840
Mum, I want to sleep near my bride.

583
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,840
- What?
- I want to sleep near my bride.

584
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,360
You want to sleep near your bride?

585
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:00,400
Good time you've chosen
to sleep near your bride.

586
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,000
Take care of your husband now.

587
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,880
Didn't you receive any letter
by the evening post?

588
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,719
Are all of you going
to drive me crazy?

589
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:18,159
I hear, Mr. Choudhury is very
ill, so I came to see him.

590
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:21,159
Have a seat. I'll get brother.

591
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:25,119
No need. Take me there.
I want to check him.

592
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,079
I didn't know you're a doctor.

593
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,880
- You're not supposed to know.
- I see.

594
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:39,280
Come.

595
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,800
How long has he had this fever?

596
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,800
Nine days.

597
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,456
Did he have chest pain from
the very beginning?

598
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,000
Yes, from the very beginning.

599
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,119
If the chest pain and fever
don't subside by tomorrow..

600
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:15,039
Send for a specialist.

601
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:16,760
Is it serious?

602
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,239
Not a very sound condition there.

603
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,000
If father was here I'd have
brought him to check him.

604
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,920
You've the big do at your club
after a couple of days.

605
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,480
Won't your father be there?

606
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,880
He'll surely come.

607
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,840
- But you must visit the club.
- I'll go.

608
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:31,199
Very good.

609
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,599
Get the medicine right away
and give it to him.

610
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:34,719
Three times today.

611
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,239
I didn't know you're a doctor.

612
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:41,199
Not a doctor, but a specialist
you might say.

613
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,639
The prescription has
dad's signature.

614
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:47,840
If you've faith in me, get
it and give it. It'll help.

615
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,719
Is it okay to get the medicine?

616
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,840
I think so. His father is such
a famous doctor, his company..

617
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,880
Must have rubbed off on his son.

618
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,519
You can get it.

619
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,480
I don't need to.

620
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:12,320
Why are you taking it off the wall?

621
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:16,480
Have you forgotten the charity
auction at Rajnath's club?

622
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:19,400
You want to take the picture,
its fine by me.

623
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,639
Kindly don't involve me with it.

624
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:24,039
It's better if you don't advise me.

625
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:30,400
Mr. Deb, the fever has increased.

626
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:32,400
- What should we do?
- Oh.

627
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,239
On my way back after giving
this painting, I'll fetch a..

628
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,039
- Good doctor.
- Okay.

629
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:40,199
You should've informed me
a couple of days earlier.

630
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:47,039
A few days back a gentleman
dropped in to see him.

631
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:49,239
He mentioned the same ailment
and prescribed these.

632
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:52,039
We didn't have the confidence
to give these.

633
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,880
It's Dr. Samanta's
prescription and..

634
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,440
You didn't have the confidence?

635
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,000
This is his son.

636
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,880
Even so, if he diagnosed the
disease 3 days back and..

637
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,800
Prescribed these medicines
it's evident..

638
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:09,079
He is a good doctor.

639
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,936
If you had given these medicines
then, he wouldn't..

640
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,400
Have deteriorated to this extent.

641
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:22,639
500! 500-1, 2, 3, sold!

642
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,480
Shuku, Rajnath has brains!

643
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,480
This is an excellent
way to gather funds.

644
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,360
500, I mean 500.

645
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:02,800
- Here goes 500.
- No, no.

646
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,360
- 500, 1, 2.
- 600.

647
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,880
- 600, 1, 2.
- 700.

648
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,519
I can't do this, brother.
Keep quiet like this.

649
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,280
I'll let him know what
a big fool he is.

650
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,400
Keep quiet.

651
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:01,679
Sonny, want to see some
magic? See, see.

652
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:23,880
Come in. Is everything alright?

653
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,760
Yes.

654
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,840
- How much?
- 3,000.

655
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,880
- 3,000?
- Yes.

656
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:28,440
Come, come in.

657
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:32,039
Sit. He didn't suspect
anything, did he?

658
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:32,679
Not at all.

659
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,679
He can fool even the hangman,
who will suspect?

660
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,840
When he saw how upset
I was, he consoled me..

661
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,159
- For half an hour.
- Well done, partner, well done!

662
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,000
'You may need the painting again.
Hang it up carefully.'

663
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,639
'There was no need
for this charade.'

664
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,320
'If you needed the money, you
should've asked. Rajnath.'

665
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:15,360
You may go.

666
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,119
You should've gauged your
enemy's strength before..

667
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,079
Going into battle with him.

668
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:30,400
- Has Shushanto written?
- No.

669
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,400
Did you send a telegram?

670
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,880
No, that is not possible.

671
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,679
Give me the address, I'll send it.

672
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:42,760
It's no use.

673
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,679
See, I understand there is
some friction between..

674
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:52,400
The two of you. But this is
hardly the time to hold on to that.

675
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,039
I know.

676
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,679
Shakuntala, I want to
ask you something.

677
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,119
- I hope you don't mind.
- What?

678
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,000
Can we send for Mr. Rajnath please?

679
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:14,679
Why do you want to call him?

680
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,199
I don't know.

681
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:23,000
When I see father suffering
I can only think of him.

682
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:27,159
What are you thinking?

683
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,239
Nothing. Alright.

684
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,480
I'll go to him.

685
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:42,480
No one here?

686
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:50,360
- No. I've told them not to come.
- Oh.

687
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,400
You're shocked, right?

688
00:54:55,159 --> 00:55:00,199
Ask someone to get the painting
you bought that day.

689
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:07,920
- I've sent that picture back.
- To whom?

690
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,519
The owner of the painting.

691
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:14,719
Why? What about the money?

692
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,800
I've sent a cheque.

693
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:29,639
Raju, I've decided to go out of
Kolkata in a couple of days.

694
00:55:30,519 --> 00:55:34,000
Why don't you go and stay with
your aunt for few days?

695
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:37,360
You're barely back.
You want to go again?

696
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:43,800
Let me go. You were the ones who
insisted I go for a change.

697
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:46,519
Where will you go?

698
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:49,760
I haven't thought about it yet.

699
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,840
I'll board a west bound
train and then decide.

700
00:55:56,599 --> 00:55:59,679
Don't worry, I'll return soon.

701
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,119
Okay.

702
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,960
Why were you so upset
about that painting?

703
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:17,639
I wasn't upset. I haven't been as
calm as that day in a long time.

704
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:27,119
Aunt, what is the matter with dad?

705
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:28,599
Why, what happened?

706
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:34,159
- He has changed a lot. He is leaving again.
- Where?

707
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:36,719
I don't know.

708
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:45,920
How would I know? Being crazy
is a family trait with you.

709
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,960
You've come to make
amends with Rajnath?

710
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,400
He isn't at home.

711
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,199
When will he return?

712
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,480
Does even he know when
he will return?

713
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:12,639
Do you need to meet him urgently?

714
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,039
Yes, it was a bit urgent.

715
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,480
You..

716
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,239
Please return this to him.

717
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,519
Look dear, if you ask for
something like this..

718
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:51,760
I'll be in a fix.

719
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:57,079
Instead, you better settle this
matter with that fool yourself.

720
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:02,599
Can you tell me what
this is all about?

721
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,760
You return it to him personally.

722
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:12,280
I don't know what the
problem here is.

723
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,480
Whatever it is, I
must tell you this.

724
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,440
My Rajnath has never harmed
anyone knowingly.

725
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:26,400
I know you believe this.

726
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,159
Unfortunately, he has been at the
receiving end of a lot of ill will.

727
00:58:30,519 --> 00:58:33,079
You too must've heard
many tales about him.

728
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:38,920
But you'll never know him if
you seek the real Raju only..

729
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,199
In his words.

730
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,119
Never mind that. You paint well.

731
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,440
If you can do something for me..

732
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:51,320
You need not return this cheque.

733
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,079
I'll give it to you as fees.

734
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,679
If I work, you may
pay me separately.

735
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,599
Very well. What do you want?

736
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,599
You've to treat a patient.

737
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:05,280
Wait here, I'll be back soon.

738
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,840
Look at this picture carefully.

739
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:14,119
When this picture was taken
she was around your age.

740
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,119
She is my wife.

741
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:20,079
She used to look like
that 20 years ago.

742
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:26,719
You've to add about 20 years
to this picture and paint it.

743
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:28,440
Can you do it?

744
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:33,880
Don't you have a more
recent picture?

745
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:41,880
No. She wasn't in my life..
With me at a later date.

746
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,559
Why? Can't you do it?

747
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,840
- I'll try.
- Very well.

748
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,360
I'll go to visit the patient.

749
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:59,920
Get these immediately. All
the instructions are given.

750
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,920
How is he?

751
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,039
Not good. You've called
me a bit too late.

752
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,800
Listen, I'll be out of
Kolkata for a few days.

753
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:19,599
You may call Raju if required.

754
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,480
I'll tell him what's to
be done before I go.

755
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,800
Why did you suddenly think of that
devious plan the other day?

756
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,199
- Were you in need of money urgently?
- No.

757
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,599
Then?

758
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:48,280
I thought it's inappropriate
that you've so much money.

759
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,880
How much of my wealth
can you lessen in this way?

760
01:00:55,639 --> 01:00:57,360
Instead, if you really feel that..

761
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,679
I shouldn't have so much money.

762
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:06,280
Come to my house when I return.

763
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,159
I'll arrange for something.

764
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,599
I know how hard it is to
gather so much wealth.

765
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,039
I see, come.

766
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:23,159
"There will be a new dawn soon..

767
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:28,280
My woes will not last."

768
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:34,199
"The beasts of unhappiness
and need won't..

769
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:38,280
Bark at the door of my existence."

770
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:43,440
"There will be a new dawn soon..

771
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:48,679
My woes will not last."

772
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:55,199
"The beasts of unhappiness
and need won't..

773
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:59,719
Bark at the door of my existence."

774
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:14,840
"The demons won't stay anymore."

775
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:27,440
"No longer will troubles stay
longer than necessary."

776
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:47,519
"No more new troubles
or problems for us."

777
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,119
Instead.

778
01:02:52,840 --> 01:03:00,840
"Each person will love the other
without any inhibition."

779
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:11,000
"No one will be left without
love and warmth."

780
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:15,719
Father!

781
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:24,000
Has sonny's letter come?
Won't he come?

782
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:29,480
Yes, father. I'll get the letter.

783
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:41,000
Father, here is the letter.
I'll read it to you.

784
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:49,559
My dear, respected father. I was
out for some important work.

785
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,039
I couldn't reply to Savita's
letter yesterday.

786
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:01,599
I can't tell you how worried
I'm about your illness.

787
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:11,400
I've asked for leave and will
leave in a day or two.

788
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:18,159
I pray to God, that you stay ..

789
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:24,599
Well and recover soon, father.

790
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,360
Father!

791
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,599
Father!

792
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,719
Mother!

793
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,679
Mother!

794
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:52,079
You've got letter?

795
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,639
Bablu!

796
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:08,880
I'm envious of Rajnath.
He is born lucky.

797
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:13,320
Brother, whom does this
picture resemble?

798
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:18,400
I don't see any resemblance.

799
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:20,920
You won't see it, go!

800
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,360
- Should I? I'll be back soon.
- Go.

801
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:05,119
- How is it?
- It's good.

802
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,880
You should've informed
before coming!

803
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:10,760
I'd have done that earlier.

804
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:14,719
But I think such formality is
not necessary with you now.

805
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,320
I came because of Mrs.
Savita's notice.

806
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,520
I dropped in to see
mum's portrait too.

807
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:26,679
You've done a good job. Send
it across when it's done.

808
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,079
And your bill along with it.

809
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:55,840
Shakuntala!

810
01:07:02,039 --> 01:07:04,920
Where is the one who was here now?

811
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,960
- Who, Mr. Rajnath?
- Yes.

812
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,400
Why did you send for him?

813
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,760
I didn't send for him.

814
01:07:18,679 --> 01:07:22,039
I sent a notice regarding leaving
the house. So he came.

815
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Oh. You, are you leaving this place?

816
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:36,119
I have to leave.

817
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,079
Government won't pay
father-in-law's pension anymore.

818
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,199
Why did Mr. Rajnath come?

819
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:52,159
He couldn't say what he came to say.

820
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:57,440
How can he simply say, stay
without paying rent?

821
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,519
So he just conveyed
his condolences..

822
01:08:00,679 --> 01:08:02,440
On father-in-law's death.

823
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,480
What's wrong with you?

824
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:09,920
Seems like something's wrong.

825
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,239
No. What can go wrong?

826
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,640
Something has happened here.

827
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,560
What can happen?

828
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:39,318
Did someone visit?

829
01:08:41,078 --> 01:08:42,478
Mr. Rajnath had come.

830
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,600
I see.

831
01:08:44,439 --> 01:08:46,279
He said the painting wasn't bad.

832
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,054
He has asked me to send the bill..

833
01:08:48,078 --> 01:08:49,558
Along with the completed painting.

834
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:51,879
I didn't have time to reply.

835
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,760
Brother, let me tell you something.

836
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,960
I'm not responsible for what
happened with my earlier..

837
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:00,840
Painting.

838
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,720
Yet, the entire blame
has come to me.

839
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,720
Where are you going?

840
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,840
I told you. Since the entire
blame has come to me..

841
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:15,038
I've to make some arrangement.

842
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:18,159
- Going to Rajnath?
- Yes.

843
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:23,439
A few days back a lady named
Kanak Mitra had asked me..

844
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,560
To give these to you.

845
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,880
You've given me this at
the right time, brother.

846
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,399
- How long have you been here?
- Just now.

847
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:10,680
- I've something to tell you.
- Yes?

848
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,560
I'm greatly indebted to you folks.

849
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,079
There is one more thing
you must do for me.

850
01:10:17,239 --> 01:10:18,239
What's that?

851
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,840
Please arrange for a
house with low rent.

852
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:24,399
Will you leave this place?

853
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,199
We've to leave. We've no choice.

854
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:34,560
You'll live alone? I mean,
I was saying..

855
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:36,560
At least here, we are with you.

856
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,320
Wherever we stay,
I hope we can meet you.

857
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:44,239
Or else I wouldn't
have taken this decision.

858
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:47,199
I've been meaning to ask you
something for a while now.

859
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,960
Give me Mr. Shushanto's address.

860
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:53,079
What will you do with the address?

861
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,880
If necessary I'll go to him.

862
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:58,560
When I began writing
letter after letter..

863
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:04,960
In my husband's name it
was really quite funny.

864
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:11,760
I felt bad for the old man. I had
no time to think about myself.

865
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,399
So let's not talk about that today.

866
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:16,920
You..

867
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:25,439
Mr. Deb, after so long, words
of sympathy won't help.

868
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,680
You? Come in.

869
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:46,920
Have a seat.

870
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
No, I'm not here to sit.

871
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:53,239
You seem to be here to make
some sort of compromise.

872
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:00,399
I don't like to fight.
It's distasteful to me.

873
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:03,079
Just like you find certain
things distasteful.

874
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:07,520
If you haven't got it yet,
let me explain it to you.

875
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:12,399
I've no empathy with people
who strut their wealth.

876
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,880
Let their be no
misunderstanding between..

877
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,960
Us about each other from now on.

878
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,279
Please answer my question.

879
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:39,880
If I hadn't caught you out
that day, would you've..

880
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,760
Returned this cheque?

881
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:45,880
No.

882
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:52,000
But I certainly would've shown
you how a rich man's..

883
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,800
Enchantment can be broken
to smithereens.

884
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:57,760
And what about the ring?

885
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,920
You took a long time returning it.

886
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,560
May be I wanted to sell
it for big bucks.

887
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:11,896
Please send for someone
to show me the way out.

888
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,439
My name has been sullied
since my student days.

889
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:19,520
Women are just playthings
that I buy with my wealth.

890
01:13:20,119 --> 01:13:21,439
I give them rings.

891
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:27,119
For cheap attraction, I buy their
paintings for Rs. 3,000.

892
01:13:31,399 --> 01:13:33,520
You know I'm alone
at home at this hour.

893
01:13:34,359 --> 01:13:41,159
Yet you didn't feel afraid
coming here alone?

894
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,159
What if I imprison
you here all night?

895
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:48,159
Mr. Rajnath, don't cross limits.

896
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:50,760
It'll be difficult for
you to get out of this.

897
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,680
Don't try to scare me, Shakuntala.

898
01:13:53,079 --> 01:13:54,840
Answer my question.

899
01:13:55,239 --> 01:13:57,600
After hearing such bad things
about me, you should've..

900
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,119
Hesitated to come to me
at so late an hour alone.

901
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,159
But you didn't, why?

902
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:05,960
If I'm really so bad, what
gave you this confidence?

903
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,400
I'm not going to back
off today, Shakuntala.

904
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:14,319
You've my word, if you answer
my question satisfactorily..

905
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,720
I'll never bother you again.

906
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,079
Okay, let go.

907
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,880
Tell me. What do you want to say?

908
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:38,600
It's okay. No need for that.

909
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,479
Come, let me drop you.

910
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:47,239
No. Let me answer first.

911
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:49,960
Let's
settle this today once and for all.

912
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,720
Just address me with respect.

913
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:54,960
I'll answer you.

914
01:14:56,079 --> 01:14:58,640
There is no point explaining
something..

915
01:14:59,479 --> 01:15:02,279
That was done on reflex.

916
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:07,560
Answer if you feel like
or just let it go.

917
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:15,119
Haven't you felt that I'm other
than what you've heard of me?

918
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:16,840
No.

919
01:15:18,359 --> 01:15:21,880
You believe everything you heard?

920
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:26,920
I believe everything
I heard and saw.

921
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,840
What if I tell you, the
blame put on me in my..

922
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:41,920
Student life is not my fault
but the misdoings of womankind?

923
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:47,479
A woman like you had ruined all
my dreams and aspirations.

924
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:51,560
Just because I didn't return
her romantic overtures..

925
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:55,199
She alleged that I made her
unconscious for an entire..

926
01:15:56,119 --> 01:16:02,720
Night under the guise
of emergency duty.

927
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:07,880
I didn't even protest. I
just kept staring at her.

928
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,040
My shortcoming was just this
that I made a mistake..

929
01:16:11,239 --> 01:16:12,920
In recognising her true colours.

930
01:16:13,079 --> 01:16:19,199
And about Kanak Mitra's ring,
she made it on her own whim.

931
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,159
She wore it on her own whim.
All I did was pay the bill.

932
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:30,680
Shakuntala, women who make
advances in the hopes..

933
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:34,439
Of wearing a ring, I never
put a ring on their finger.

934
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:41,640
Ramdin, take the lady home.

935
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:44,439
Mr. Rajnath.

936
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,960
I think the first person to hear
of all these allegations..

937
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,600
Against me was Mr. Debkamal.

938
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:53,640
That may be so, I don't mind.

939
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:57,039
Because I don't give clarifications
to anyone.

940
01:16:58,039 --> 01:17:03,600
And since you wanted to finish
the matter today, I won't go..

941
01:17:04,439 --> 01:17:06,199
Into any clarifications.

942
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:09,920
You can rest assured.

943
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,039
Madam!

944
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,600
What is it?

945
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:34,199
The same thing, what about
a low rent house for me?

946
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,000
- I'm checking.
- I know.

947
01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:39,640
May I know when the
checking will finish?

948
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,960
I can tell you. Debu, the house
I've seen today is first class.

949
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:47,039
Mrs. Savita, we'll go tomorrow,
you too may have a look.

950
01:17:49,079 --> 01:17:50,159
Well, that's taken care of.

951
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:54,399
Shuku, what did you tell Mr.
Rajnath the other day?

952
01:17:57,399 --> 01:17:58,199
Why?

953
01:17:58,279 --> 01:18:01,279
There is some news in
the papers today.

954
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:07,359
It's about their club. It says
here, artist Ms. Shakuntala's..

955
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:11,960
Painting was auctioned for Rs.
3,000 and she donated..

956
01:18:12,039 --> 01:18:17,279
The money for public
welfare etc. etc.

957
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:19,840
Did you tell him the other day?

958
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:22,000
Not at all.

959
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,560
The man sure has a sense of humour.

960
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:29,239
One man has put all
of you in a quandary.

961
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,880
But if I get the chance..

962
01:18:34,359 --> 01:18:39,199
To ruin him today
I won't spare him.

963
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:46,640
But respect, that's
something else now.

964
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:52,479
That he'll have from me, forever.
As long as I live.

965
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:58,600
"You're the truth, you're
pure and beautiful."

966
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:04,760
"You light a thousand lamps
in everyone's lives."

967
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:10,520
"In one hand you hold the
cup of venom and in the..

968
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:18,600
Other, well being
of the entire world."

969
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:25,319
"You're the truth, you're
pure and beautiful."

970
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:31,920
"You light a thousand lamps
in everyone's lives."

971
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,560
- You?
- Yes.

972
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:37,479
When did you come?

973
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,720
Just now.

974
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,399
Oh, come in.

975
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:56,159
"Oh lord, in this wide world
of yours, why do people..

976
01:19:56,239 --> 01:20:00,600
Hanker for ownership?"

977
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,520
Were you successful in your mission?

978
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:06,199
"You light a hundred lamps."

979
01:20:06,279 --> 01:20:07,439
Is there a mistake?

980
01:20:08,079 --> 01:20:12,159
Mistake? None at all.

981
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:17,920
I knew there is no mistake
from the very first day.

982
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:21,560
"You light a hundred lamps."

983
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,279
- I'll leave again tomorrow.
- Where?

984
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:32,760
Where? I don't know yet.

985
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,600
When will you return?

986
01:20:38,479 --> 01:20:40,079
There is no question of returning.

987
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:44,199
"Quench this thirst of mine, you're..

988
01:20:44,319 --> 01:20:48,520
The path and the direction."

989
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:52,680
"You're the supreme path shower."

990
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:56,359
"Will you lead the way for me?"

991
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:57,640
Will you go with me?

992
01:20:59,079 --> 01:21:01,439
"You light a hundred lamps."

993
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,760
Where will I go?

994
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,840
"You're the truth, you're
pure and beautiful."

995
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,600
For you men it is easy to
just walk out like this.

996
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:17,479
But for us, we've to go through
trials till the very last day.

997
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:18,976
"You're the truth, you're
pure and beautiful."

998
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,600
Where can I escape to?

999
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:24,319
"You're the truth,
you're pure and beautiful."

1000
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:26,039
Are you afraid of Raju?

1001
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,119
Afraid?

1002
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:33,239
"You're the truth, you're
pure and beautiful."

1003
01:21:33,479 --> 01:21:36,239
Fear? Not fear.

1004
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:45,159
But I can't put a name
to the feeling.

1005
01:21:46,119 --> 01:21:48,000
Never mind. Raju will be upset.

1006
01:21:48,079 --> 01:21:56,079
How could I bear such grave
pain that you caused me?

1007
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:04,520
But because of me, someone
like me got lost in this..

1008
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Big, wide world.

1009
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:09,840
How can I forget her?

1010
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:14,880
But the fault is entirely mine.

1011
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,199
You didn't know anything.

1012
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:20,279
Then why do you want to take
on this responsibility?

1013
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,720
Therein lies the problem.

1014
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:29,319
What I've here is not reality.

1015
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:36,520
But if I disown this can you
imagine what a big lie it would be?

1016
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:45,159
"Quench this thirst of mine, you're..

1017
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:49,119
The path and the direction."

1018
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:54,079
- Did you find out the truth?
- Yes.

1019
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,199
What else did you find out?

1020
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,159
I'll tell you everything.
But listen..

1021
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:04,960
Can you give me something to eat?

1022
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:10,760
I'm very hungry and sleepy.

1023
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:16,640
Wait for a bit, I'll get
you food right away.

1024
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:23,199
"You're the truth, you're
pure and beautiful."

1025
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:25,095
"You light a thousand lamps
in everyone's lives."

1026
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:28,159
I won't go. Inform him.

1027
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:30,439
I can't. It's impossible.

1028
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,840
Come tomorrow morning,
I can't do a thing now.

1029
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:36,520
I've to see him now,
by hook or by crook.

1030
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:39,199
Please let me pass,
I'll meet him.

1031
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:40,359
Shocking!

1032
01:23:40,439 --> 01:23:42,560
I won't leave without meeting him.

1033
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,920
Send word to doctor.

1034
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,479
Let her in.

1035
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:54,800
Doc, doctor, please come with me.

1036
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:02,039
I beg of you, I'll arrange for
your fees any which way.

1037
01:24:04,119 --> 01:24:10,199
You know us, you can rest assured.

1038
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:27,399
How is he?

1039
01:24:28,479 --> 01:24:30,119
What were you doing for so long?

1040
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,000
Give me a piece of paper.

1041
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,000
Tuli.

1042
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,439
What happened? Did you get it?

1043
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,600
I couldn't do better. I got Rs. 35
at 12%%% interest per rupee.

1044
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:50,199
Okay.

1045
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,159
Send your man with me.

1046
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,039
Your fees.

1047
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:12,199
Do as I say.

1048
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:52,840
Doctor, doctor, doctor!

1049
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:41,239
I hear you're leaving.

1050
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,239
- I have to go.
- Why?

1051
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:52,039
Running away from a problem.

1052
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:53,439
Suprabha!

1053
01:26:54,840 --> 01:27:02,039
Doctor, as it is I can never repay
what you've done for us.

1054
01:27:09,479 --> 01:27:12,520
What do you think, I'll
let you go without..

1055
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,560
Repaying?

1056
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:12,920
You have to tell me something today.

1057
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,039
What is it?

1058
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:20,560
Did you marry me to come
here and get drunk?

1059
01:28:21,479 --> 01:28:25,199
No. For peace.

1060
01:28:27,039 --> 01:28:29,159
To get some peace.

1061
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:32,119
Why, what is your problem?

1062
01:28:33,039 --> 01:28:35,199
It's been 3 months to our marriage.

1063
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,080
Did you marry me secretly
just because..

1064
01:28:37,119 --> 01:28:38,439
I belong to a different caste?

1065
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:41,279
And you leave your wife
alone here day after day?

1066
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,119
Tell me honestly, is
this the only reason?

1067
01:28:44,199 --> 01:28:45,119
Stop it!

1068
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:48,079
Stop it, stop it, for
God's sake, stop it!

1069
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:52,239
I'm not in a good mood today.

1070
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,319
Why the bad mood?

1071
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,000
I'm your wife, tell me.

1072
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:00,279
I'll tell you why his mood is bad.

1073
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:04,520
You?

1074
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:06,800
Who are you?

1075
01:29:07,119 --> 01:29:09,920
Tell her, tell her who I am.

1076
01:29:10,119 --> 01:29:12,720
Tell her why you married
her so secretly?

1077
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:14,840
How dare you come here?

1078
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:16,479
Why have you come here?

1079
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,600
To have a look.

1080
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:23,000
To see before I leave, if what
people whisper is true or not.

1081
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:26,640
Oh, you've come to have
a look and leave?

1082
01:29:27,319 --> 01:29:30,880
Take a look, have a good look.

1083
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:35,680
You've troubled me a lot,
please leave now.

1084
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:39,680
Go, go wherever you want.
Let me stay in peace.

1085
01:29:40,119 --> 01:29:41,760
I want a little peace.

1086
01:29:42,039 --> 01:29:44,159
I've come, so I can leave,
I'm not here to stay.

1087
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,880
You don't have to worry for
Debkamal or me from now on.

1088
01:29:48,279 --> 01:29:50,119
Leave my Debkamal behind!

1089
01:29:50,319 --> 01:29:53,920
Believe me, I didn't intentionally
set out to break..

1090
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,159
Someone's home.

1091
01:29:55,239 --> 01:29:59,720
Please return home. I give you my
word everything will be fine.

1092
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:01,856
I'm not educated and all to
speak in a sophisticated..

1093
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:04,039
Manner like you.

1094
01:30:05,079 --> 01:30:09,319
Let me go, you've
my Debkamal's oath.

1095
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:15,760
No, please don't do that. I
can't allow this. Not at all.

1096
01:30:19,159 --> 01:30:20,319
You didn't get?

1097
01:30:23,479 --> 01:30:24,479
Listen.

1098
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:30,039
I heard from Ramu that you're
leaving this place.

1099
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:34,920
Where will you go?

1100
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:36,920
I'll see.

1101
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:43,319
You won't acknowledge our
relationship henceforth?

1102
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:48,319
This is something you
wanted to hide..

1103
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:50,399
It will remain so forever.

1104
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,039
You're not alone in this.

1105
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:01,960
You can't deny the one
who will soon arrive.

1106
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:08,239
I'll deny that too. That
responsibility is yours not mine.

1107
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:13,039
When the time comes, I'll send
the one who'll arrive to you.

1108
01:31:13,319 --> 01:31:15,800
Won't you think of me at all?

1109
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,520
I've decided.

1110
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:21,720
What about me? Won't you think
of my feelings at all?

1111
01:31:22,439 --> 01:31:27,119
What will I live with? Tell
me, Suprabha, tell me.

1112
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:30,520
Answer me, Suprabha! Suprabha,
tell me!

1113
01:31:41,159 --> 01:31:42,199
Come and eat.

1114
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:49,560
Listen, I've written a will.

1115
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:53,960
Read it carefully and sign it.

1116
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:59,840
No need for witnesses. Let
Raju do what he sees fit.

1117
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:03,720
I've written to Raju and
told him everything.

1118
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:06,119
Come.

1119
01:32:36,359 --> 01:32:38,680
Raju, what is the matter with you?

1120
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:44,399
Father has written, read it.

1121
01:32:45,479 --> 01:32:49,239
Forget the letter. What's
wrong with you?

1122
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:53,239
Is it because your property
is getting divided?

1123
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:56,415
Why didn't father tell me here
that Debkamal is my elder..

1124
01:32:56,439 --> 01:32:58,439
Brother?

1125
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:03,520
I don't know.

1126
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:04,920
I'm sure you know.

1127
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I've been observing all these days,
but didn't ask anything.

1128
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:12,880
Today, I want to know everything.

1129
01:33:14,119 --> 01:33:18,079
Is Debkamal my stepbrother?

1130
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:22,119
Did his mother leave home,
before I was born or after?

1131
01:33:22,279 --> 01:33:24,960
Before. But..

1132
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,079
I understand.

1133
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:29,320
What arrangements has father made?

1134
01:33:29,439 --> 01:33:30,439
I'll tell you.

1135
01:33:31,159 --> 01:33:33,680
What has he written in
the letter about that?

1136
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:39,039
He wrote you've the will. It'll be
registered as soon as you want.

1137
01:33:40,439 --> 01:33:45,520
And if I don't wish it, this
will stay a secret forever.

1138
01:33:48,359 --> 01:33:50,199
When did father send the will?

1139
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:53,319
He didn't send it, he came himself.

1140
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,079
Father had come here?

1141
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:08,600
I see.

1142
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:14,520
Raju! Listen! Where are you going?
You wanted to see the will!

1143
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:15,600
That won't be necessary.

1144
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:17,680
No, you have to listen to me.

1145
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:21,680
You've to give Debkamal
half of what you receive.

1146
01:34:38,119 --> 01:34:39,880
That is why I like
you so much, aunt.

1147
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:41,920
I never said I won't
share the property.

1148
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,720
I just don't want the
will to go through.

1149
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:49,399
If we set out to do that,
father's closely guarded..

1150
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,640
Secret will be common
knowledge and his good..

1151
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,520
Name will be sullied.

1152
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:08,039
Have the doctor check
your head, you donkey!

1153
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,680
Forget gentlefolk, even human
beings can't live there.

1154
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,760
You're only good at fooling around.

1155
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:19,279
What is it you want? You won't
get anything better..

1156
01:35:19,359 --> 01:35:20,960
Than this at this rent.

1157
01:35:21,319 --> 01:35:22,880
I've been going mad
looking for houses.

1158
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,199
Leave it! You don't have to
look further. It's enough.

1159
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,359
Come, what's the
point in waiting here!

1160
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:35,760
Behold! The show is here!

1161
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:46,000
- Debu, you go ahead, I've some work here.
- Where?

1162
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:47,239
You don't know.

1163
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,760
Listen, I've something to say.

1164
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,159
Don't mind.

1165
01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:57,680
Stop looking for houses.

1166
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:05,359
You won't like any house for Ms.
Savita except room ♪ 27.

1167
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:08,600
Idiot!

1168
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:16,000
Honestly, didn't you like the house?

1169
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:17,159
Did you?

1170
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:21,079
Forget about me. It doesn't matter
whether I like it or not.

1171
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:25,439
Besides, the way you shouted
at that innocent man..

1172
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:27,560
It's not his fault, you know.

1173
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:31,880
I know, what Bhaskar said was right.

1174
01:36:33,399 --> 01:36:37,520
We'll never get something better
than this at this rent.

1175
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,159
Why did you stop here?

1176
01:36:42,359 --> 01:36:43,840
Come, let's go fix the place.

1177
01:36:44,119 --> 01:36:45,159
I didn't say that.

1178
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,119
I just wanted to know why
you didn't like the place.

1179
01:36:48,199 --> 01:36:49,439
I liked it, come on.

1180
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:52,319
What a problem! Do you want
to attract a crowd?

1181
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,520
Come, I don't like that
place one bit. Come.

1182
01:36:56,319 --> 01:37:00,439
Saw that?! I told you,
only beasts live here!

1183
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:06,479
Beasts like this are present on
every street of Kolkata. Come.

1184
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:12,319
I'll find a place for you within
7 days. Keep everything ready.

1185
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:16,640
Even Babloo speaks like
this when he is angry.

1186
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:17,800
Meaning?

1187
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:20,455
I mean, you don't have to look
for houses for me anymore.

1188
01:37:20,479 --> 01:37:21,680
Why?

1189
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:25,439
If the landlord comes and sees
this he'll kill both of us.

1190
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:28,439
Give me the brush! Give!

1191
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:40,880
Isn't Debkamal here?

1192
01:37:42,279 --> 01:37:44,760
He has gone out. Please have a seat.

1193
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,079
Brother will be back soon.

1194
01:37:47,279 --> 01:37:48,359
He's out?

1195
01:37:49,399 --> 01:37:53,079
When he returns please tell
him to surely meet me today.

1196
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,000
It's important.

1197
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,359
Why? What's the matter?

1198
01:37:58,039 --> 01:37:59,359
Nothing to worry about.

1199
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:02,776
How long have you been here?

1200
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:03,880
Oh.

1201
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:05,960
Tell me.

1202
01:38:09,479 --> 01:38:10,479
Read this.

1203
01:38:56,079 --> 01:38:58,600
What is the proof here?

1204
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:03,159
Father has collected evidence by
going out every now and then.

1205
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:08,920
I left home when I was 2.
Why did he suspect?

1206
01:39:09,359 --> 01:39:11,880
He heard your introduction
at the club.

1207
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:16,880
If you've any doubts,
you may ask aunt.

1208
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:19,680
I don't know everything clearly.

1209
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,279
What do you want to do?

1210
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:30,760
Father's wish is clearly written,
even though he did leave it..

1211
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:33,039
To my discretion.

1212
01:39:34,199 --> 01:39:39,039
However, I've no objection
to his wish.

1213
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,720
There is one condition, though.

1214
01:39:43,159 --> 01:39:44,920
Condition?

1215
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:49,680
I've no issue with money, but I
do care about dad's good name.

1216
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:52,000
Therefore, I don't want
to go to the court..

1217
01:39:52,079 --> 01:39:54,039
Regarding property and all.

1218
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,840
Why?

1219
01:39:59,079 --> 01:40:02,399
The Samanta family has
a very good name.

1220
01:40:03,279 --> 01:40:05,279
If we go to courts etc. for
property matters this..

1221
01:40:05,479 --> 01:40:07,839
Rather strange incident won't
remain a secret any longer.

1222
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:11,359
If there was an incident,
it was not a lie.

1223
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:12,760
Why do you want to hide it?

1224
01:40:13,039 --> 01:40:16,000
There must be something behind
this whole thing which..

1225
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:19,920
Is why dad kept this entire
episode a secret always.

1226
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:23,439
Naturally, he too is
to blame for this.

1227
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:24,560
I don't deny that.

1228
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:28,079
A man whose wife leaves home,
he must be guilty..

1229
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:29,439
Rajnath!

1230
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:37,119
That's why I say, discussions
aside, I said what I feel.

1231
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:40,600
And this is my final decision.

1232
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,079
You may leave now.

1233
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:45,720
If I've something to say,
I'll let you know later.

1234
01:40:46,039 --> 01:40:48,800
Alright. Give me the letter.

1235
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:00,880
If I wanted to cheat you,
I wouldn't have..

1236
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:03,239
Come here with the letter.

1237
01:41:08,119 --> 01:41:09,640
I could've simply burnt it.

1238
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,199
No brother. I won't allow this.

1239
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:17,520
We've come so far on our own steam.

1240
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,800
- Why take favours from dame luck at this stage?
- Hm.

1241
01:41:21,079 --> 01:41:24,239
Don't ho-hum. Let's
leave this place.

1242
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:27,600
Shuku, isn't Rajnath
a wonderful boy.

1243
01:41:28,119 --> 01:41:33,920
His intelligence matches
his courage.

1244
01:41:35,079 --> 01:41:36,960
No point resisting.

1245
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,960
Brother, are you crazy?

1246
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:45,520
- May be.

1247
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:50,560
Now, such doubts will
assail you that even..

1248
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,680
You may go crazy.

1249
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,439
- May I say something?
- No.

1250
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:03,520
I'll say it. I thought
I had no compassion.

1251
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:06,880
But compared to you
I'm quite a softie.

1252
01:42:08,439 --> 01:42:11,199
You're supposed to
build not destroy.

1253
01:42:11,279 --> 01:42:14,680
Bhaskar, I've told you so
many times I hate anyone..

1254
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:15,960
Speaking like a wise fool!

1255
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:18,520
You'll do as I tell you.

1256
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:23,199
I want the entire history
of the Samanta family.

1257
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:25,960
When are you leaving?

1258
01:42:29,119 --> 01:42:30,560
I take the train tonight.

1259
01:42:42,439 --> 01:42:43,439
Okay.

1260
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:50,960
- Will you please ask Bhaskar to come?
- Why?

1261
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:54,000
If his house is vacant I'll take it.

1262
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:58,760
- Bhaskar is very busy now, he has no time.
- Oh.

1263
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:05,039
Besides, you can't leave now.

1264
01:43:08,239 --> 01:43:12,439
Earlier, I would've been happy if
you had forced your will on me.

1265
01:43:16,119 --> 01:43:17,439
And now?

1266
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:19,960
I don't know.

1267
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:26,359
But the path that you've taken,
if you ever return from that..

1268
01:43:26,439 --> 01:43:31,279
I may be able to answer you.

1269
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:38,640
Listen to me. Sort out your
differences with Mr. Rajnath.

1270
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:43,520
Trying to take him on you've
only hurt yourself.

1271
01:43:45,319 --> 01:43:46,960
It's not his fault.

1272
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:50,000
Is the fault mine?

1273
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:56,760
No, not so. Destiny has
always made fun of you.

1274
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,359
Never made fun of him.

1275
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:01,239
It will now.

1276
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:06,760
Where is Shakuntala?

1277
01:44:07,279 --> 01:44:09,479
Why? At her student's place.

1278
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:12,800
Oh. This means she'll
be late returning.

1279
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:17,640
Tell her I'm going
out for a few days.

1280
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:19,439
No need to worry.

1281
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:22,760
You're leaving without meeting her?

1282
01:44:24,199 --> 01:44:27,760
- I've no time.
- Oh.

1283
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:38,680
Debkamal, when did you come?

1284
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:42,880
Looks like you know I was away.

1285
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:55,640
I've gathered the Samanta
family's entire history.

1286
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:02,439
Please tell Rajnath, one day
he wanted to give me..

1287
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:05,439
Wealth. I didn't take it.

1288
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:12,840
Today, I want not half but
his entire property.

1289
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,281
He wanted to save the family's
good name and didn't want..

1290
01:45:16,319 --> 01:45:18,319
A legal will and all.

1291
01:45:19,319 --> 01:45:23,000
For the same reason, I ask him
to give up..everything today.

1292
01:45:24,319 --> 01:45:26,640
I've written everything to Rajnath.

1293
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:29,840
I've given him 3 days time.

1294
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:34,159
He has to let me know
within this time.

1295
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:42,479
Now it is in your hand to
make him agree or not.

1296
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:49,840
Rajnath may not listen to his aunt,
but surely he'll listen to..

1297
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,720
His mother.

1298
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:53,680
Debkamal!

1299
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:56,199
I know, how big..

1300
01:45:56,279 --> 01:46:00,359
It's okay! If you know so much,
don't forget you speak..

1301
01:46:00,439 --> 01:46:02,239
In front of a mother.

1302
01:46:05,079 --> 01:46:07,359
This mother can bear a lot,
at the same time she can..

1303
01:46:07,439 --> 01:46:09,199
Be very firm.

1304
01:46:10,399 --> 01:46:12,520
I would've certainly
told him everything.

1305
01:46:13,319 --> 01:46:15,719
But I took pity on the man who
couldn't get a night's sound..

1306
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:18,640
Sleep for 20 long years.

1307
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:21,440
I didn't want to send
him to an early death.

1308
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,881
Year after year, he finished
himself only fretting about..

1309
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,640
The two of you.

1310
01:46:26,359 --> 01:46:28,559
If you have the heart to understand
this, you may call..

1311
01:46:29,079 --> 01:46:32,079
Me mother.
Not to look for excuses!

1312
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,000
You?

1313
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:48,680
Is Mr. Debkamal here?

1314
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:50,079
You..

1315
01:46:58,119 --> 01:46:59,319
Where is your brother?

1316
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,080
I had some important work with him.

1317
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:03,960
Brother is not home.

1318
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:10,079
Please have a seat.

1319
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:19,399
When he returns tell him I'm ready
to hand over the entire..

1320
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:22,119
Property to him.

1321
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,960
And that he should go
to the office and..

1322
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:27,279
Learn about the business.

1323
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:33,760
And the house, he'll get
it the day he wants.

1324
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:37,920
The house, everything?

1325
01:47:40,079 --> 01:47:43,760
Yes, everything except me.

1326
01:47:48,399 --> 01:47:52,279
Have you finished mum's painting?

1327
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:56,760
Will you give it to me?

1328
01:48:01,399 --> 01:48:03,359
You probably think why I need it.

1329
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:08,399
Dad is not here. Everything
is my responsibility.

1330
01:48:09,079 --> 01:48:12,479
Right up to keeping the picture
in it's right place.

1331
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:17,119
I'll give it to you.

1332
01:48:50,199 --> 01:48:53,319
You were mentioning that keeping
it in it's rightful place..

1333
01:48:53,399 --> 01:49:00,079
Is also your responsibility.
Where are you going now?

1334
01:49:03,479 --> 01:49:04,800
I'll see where I can go.

1335
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:06,760
Thank you!

1336
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:09,760
Apart from this, the employees
will do everything.

1337
01:49:10,239 --> 01:49:12,560
You only have to take
care of the accounts.

1338
01:49:13,199 --> 01:49:15,640
If you've any problems, let
me know from time to time.

1339
01:49:16,439 --> 01:49:21,359
And all my banks have
been sent notices..

1340
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:25,760
Aren't you listening?

1341
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:28,439
Oh, no tell me.

1342
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:31,840
Are you unwell?

1343
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:36,319
Yes. I mean, I was preoccupied.

1344
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:41,760
Besides, I'm unwell.

1345
01:49:43,239 --> 01:49:46,840
You're a doctor, give
me some medicine.

1346
01:49:50,119 --> 01:49:55,720
How can you take that
medicine confidently?

1347
01:49:58,199 --> 01:50:00,520
Come, I'll show you the factory.

1348
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:04,279
You can meet everyone. Come.

1349
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:09,279
Debu.

1350
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:11,520
I'm here.

1351
01:50:23,279 --> 01:50:24,399
What are you staring at?

1352
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:28,920
- Just to see how a millionaire looks!
- How?

1353
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:34,239
When I used to drink a lot I
used to see bloody faces..

1354
01:50:34,319 --> 01:50:34,960
Quiet!

1355
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:35,720
Brother, calm down.

1356
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:38,840
Even a corpse in a graveyard
will wake up with your voice!

1357
01:50:42,479 --> 01:50:46,039
Sister, why are you so quiet?

1358
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:51,680
I do fear Debu's wrath
but I'll still say it.

1359
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,239
I know he has recognised Mr.
Rajnath for what he is.

1360
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:00,680
Sister, you were wrong
in recognising him.

1361
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:04,279
Bhaskar, I've told
you so many times..

1362
01:51:04,359 --> 01:51:05,760
If you talk like a foolish..

1363
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,760
Wise person, you don't
like it. Right?

1364
01:51:10,359 --> 01:51:12,335
Brother, you always got it
wrong that is why I never..

1365
01:51:12,359 --> 01:51:13,680
Listened to you.

1366
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:17,279
You should actually say, when
fools mistakenly speak the..

1367
01:51:17,359 --> 01:51:21,760
Truth, wise men like
you can't stand it.

1368
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:23,439
It's okay, brother. I'll leave.

1369
01:51:29,239 --> 01:51:31,840
- Excuse me.
- Who me?

1370
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:33,880
Yes.

1371
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:37,039
Is that house still available?

1372
01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:38,439
I don't know.

1373
01:51:39,199 --> 01:51:40,920
Can you please check for me?

1374
01:51:41,319 --> 01:51:44,439
I can, but no pleases. You've
to pay for my streetcar fare.

1375
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,480
Never mind, you don't
have to give it.

1376
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:50,520
When you requested me, I knew..

1377
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:52,720
You took me for a gentleman.

1378
01:51:53,199 --> 01:51:55,680
There goes my 50 paise. I'll
let you know after 2 days.

1379
01:51:59,359 --> 01:52:02,319
Debu, may I ask you a question?

1380
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:03,720
Yes.

1381
01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:06,279
Why did Mr. Rajnath say
that the other day?

1382
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:08,240
That will be the arrangement
that is why.

1383
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:09,799
That is not the answer
to my question.

1384
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,279
Why this arrangement?

1385
01:52:11,479 --> 01:52:14,600
I'm the sole owner of the
property, which is why?

1386
01:52:15,079 --> 01:52:16,359
And Mr. Rajnath?

1387
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:23,359
The court will decide
what his share is.

1388
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:26,880
But he is unwilling to go so far.

1389
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:28,880
Why?

1390
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:32,359
He may be my stepbrother, but
that too is open to the..

1391
01:52:32,439 --> 01:52:34,359
Court's decision.

1392
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:38,039
He never had anyone called 'aunt'.

1393
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:39,840
She is his mother.

1394
01:52:42,399 --> 01:52:43,640
Mother?

1395
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:19,079
- Mother!
- Raju!

1396
01:53:20,319 --> 01:53:21,600
I came to you mother.

1397
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:29,239
No, no, no! You can't do this!
I won't let this happen!

1398
01:53:29,319 --> 01:53:30,600
Shuku!

1399
01:53:32,119 --> 01:53:33,560
You've brought me up, brother.

1400
01:53:34,319 --> 01:53:35,800
Don't try to scare me.

1401
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:40,560
Forget Rajnath, have you
thought of his mother?

1402
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,159
Not once did you think how
low you've pulled them!

1403
01:53:44,079 --> 01:53:46,760
You sympathise with everyone today,
but have you ever..

1404
01:53:47,159 --> 01:53:49,279
Spared a thought
for my predicament?

1405
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:52,120
A helpless woman with her
two year old sought shelter..

1406
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:54,840
Seeking help from all and sundry.

1407
01:53:55,319 --> 01:54:02,159
She finally left life with that
humiliation and failure in her heart.

1408
01:54:03,399 --> 01:54:09,640
And me, a son of a millionaire.
I grew up in starvation.

1409
01:54:10,159 --> 01:54:14,840
I was ready to bite myself
to satisfy my hunger.

1410
01:54:15,039 --> 01:54:18,039
Today I want money, immense wealth.

1411
01:54:18,439 --> 01:54:20,135
So that I can bring succour
to thousands of boys who..

1412
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:21,199
Suffer the way I did.

1413
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:24,880
I'll make my institute a success
by hook or by crook!

1414
01:54:28,439 --> 01:54:31,840
You could relate to me about
my father very nicely when..

1415
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,200
We were kids. Do you remember?

1416
01:54:36,399 --> 01:54:38,399
You've probably forgotten
everything now.

1417
01:54:39,479 --> 01:54:41,199
Debu, I haven't forgotten.

1418
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:46,800
As we grow, the greatest
desire we have is to..

1419
01:54:47,119 --> 01:54:48,600
Forget ourselves.

1420
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:57,840
When this desire overcomes us,
we forget who we really are.

1421
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:04,279
Debu, the ones for whom you
seek this wealth, they have..

1422
01:55:04,439 --> 01:55:08,520
Moved away from your vision
a long time back.

1423
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:09,840
You don't even recall that.

1424
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:10,359
Shuku!

1425
01:55:10,439 --> 01:55:13,359
What you're trying to do now is
not a mission to serve but..

1426
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:14,840
Your make believe lifestyle.

1427
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:16,576
Forget finding yourself, from
there you will even lose..

1428
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:18,199
Sight of the sky!

1429
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,359
No, Debu, this is not done!
I won't let you!

1430
01:55:28,079 --> 01:55:31,239
Very well then, release
me in that case.

1431
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:37,960
I haven't stopped anyone,
where will you go?

1432
01:55:43,199 --> 01:55:44,439
Let's see.

1433
01:55:47,479 --> 01:55:53,840
I told you once, if someone
calls me out of real need..

1434
01:55:57,279 --> 01:55:59,439
I'll have no objections
to going to such a person.

1435
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:05,199
For a few days now, I hear
that person calling me.

1436
01:56:08,119 --> 01:56:10,199
I hear it day and night.

1437
01:56:56,840 --> 01:57:01,079
Guard, guard, guard!

1438
01:58:25,399 --> 01:58:27,039
Why are these pictures still here?

1439
01:58:27,119 --> 01:58:28,119
These pictures?

1440
01:58:28,159 --> 01:58:30,760
Yes, these pictures. Take
them off right away.

1441
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:32,760
- Right away?
- Yes!

1442
01:58:33,079 --> 01:58:36,199
Take them off now! This one,
this one, this one!

1443
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,479
Shall I remove this picture?

1444
02:00:03,479 --> 02:00:04,600
What did you say?

1445
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:05,880
Should I dump this picture?

1446
02:00:06,439 --> 02:00:10,840
This one?

1447
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:15,640
Out.

1448
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:19,880
Get out!
I say, get out!

1449
02:00:20,119 --> 02:00:24,199
I don't want anyone,
get out, get out!

1450
02:01:06,279 --> 02:01:09,680
You, at this hour?

1451
02:01:13,439 --> 02:01:18,199
Come in. Come.

1452
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:32,520
Have a seat, I'll get mother.

1453
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:35,039
I've already met mother.

1454
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:48,840
Do you want to say something?

1455
02:01:52,079 --> 02:01:59,640
Yes. But I don't know what to say.

1456
02:02:04,359 --> 02:02:08,600
Have you come alone?
Or is Debu with you?

1457
02:02:12,119 --> 02:02:13,520
I've come alone.

1458
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:19,439
May I ask why?

1459
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:29,640
Because, I had no problems
finding my station in life.

1460
02:02:39,119 --> 02:02:44,039
Now that you're a millionaire, are
you taking pity on the poor?

1461
02:02:51,199 --> 02:02:53,039
I haven't come with material wealth..

1462
02:02:54,439 --> 02:03:02,000
But with wealth in my heart.

1463
02:03:04,239 --> 02:03:06,880
That is something I always had.

1464
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:10,079
I came because I wanted to.

1465
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:12,616
Please don't humiliate
me by asking for..

1466
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:13,720
Any more explanations.

1467
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:24,880
Rajnath,

1468
02:03:33,199 --> 02:03:38,960
I don't think you ever had
the strength to deny me.

1469
02:04:59,359 --> 02:05:00,439
Mr. Deb!

1470
02:05:15,159 --> 02:05:19,680
I've been waiting for this
day for the last 20 years.

1471
02:05:20,199 --> 02:05:23,600
Now that you've arrived,
will you leave like this?

1472
02:05:34,359 --> 02:05:35,399
Mother!

1473
02:05:36,279 --> 02:05:40,479
"Quench this thirst of mine, you're..

1474
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:45,000
The path and the direction."

1475
02:05:45,079 --> 02:05:49,359
"You're the supreme path shower."

1476
02:05:49,439 --> 02:05:53,039
"Will you lead the way for me?"

1477
02:05:53,359 --> 02:05:59,560
"You light a hundred lamps
in everyone's life."

1478
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:05,720
"You're the truth,
you're pure and beautiful."

1479
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:12,479
"You light a hundred lamps
in everyone's life."

1480
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:14,760
"You are truth.."
