Whose?
- Mine!

3
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,374
If looks are there,
can survive in the field.

4
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:45,608
Our Seena was chucked out! Only
because, had no enough of looks.

5
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:49,173
Chucked out!
- Then what, told to go!

6
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:53,278
Shall we apply some more
pan cakes below the neck?

7
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:56,240
This channel doesn't
want people like me!

8
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:02,348
If we people read the news, it seems
there won't be hike in viewership.

Hey Girl! I'm going!

For the time being will join the

Not because of looks...

14
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,238
...on reading the news there was
a spelling mistake, which is why.

15
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:22,544
Do you know on whose, name it was?

16
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,713
Whose was it?
- 'Kannan Koothattukulam'

17
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,610
Honey come, there is a breaking news.
- Coming buddy!

Get lost man!

21
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,746
The Finance Minister of Kerala,
K P Ravi Varma...

22
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,871
...was admitted at the Reheja
hospital at Delhi, due to heart attack.

23
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,072
Few hours back he was talking to
media persons, he was collapsing.

24
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,778
For a person to live for a day
Rs. 28/- was enough...

25
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,574
...as cited by the Planning
commission, however...

26
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,704
...Sri, Ravi Varma was fully in favor with
the planning commission's decision.

27
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:02,538
Following that, from his own party
members, strong criticism aroused.

28
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:06,046
As per the reports, obtained, Ravi Varma
had not battled out the danger zone.

29
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:10,941
Call that Anthonichan here!

30
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,276
Mister Anthonichan!
- Yes.

31
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:26,908
Did you get Akhilesh?
- Yes.

32
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:27,904
When will he reach?

33
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,674
In Qatar airways, via Doha,
will reach tomorrow morning.

34
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:32,473
How are things outside?

35
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,171
This Delhi journey,
then sudden arrival of Akhilesh...

36
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,970
...had created some discord, among...

37
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,875
...the members of youth
wing and their buddies.

38
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:40,947
Akhilesh, knows how
to deal with these kind of men.

39
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:43,447
On that matter,
he is much smarter than me.

40
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,246
He is coming here, with
a definite plan and agendas.

41
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:50,311
Then am I not a heart patient?

42
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:54,537
Will submerge that, in this

do like that. That is sirs order.

Coming, after enough of training.

Are you not informed with the matters?

50
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:20,413
Most probably, son, Akhilesh will
be the new leader of youth wing.

51
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:25,378

Good if you go there,
Mollamma had called from Paris.

00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,713
Do you want to harass
our party to the core?

167
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:21,211
If that is the intention,
just carry on writing like that.

168
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:24,112
But regarding the caliber of Akhilesh...

169
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,541
...the ordinary people out here,
very well knows it.

170
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:29,136
Hasn't he got education, isn't he a
young man who has got an integrity?

171
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:31,736
Isn't he smart? Then what is the
problem? That, he is my son! Is that so?

172
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:32,903
Sir, but, that...

173
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,447
See, please I'm a heart patient.

174
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:38,474
When you attack a person,
on surrounding...

175
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:40,103
...at least that you
must consider that, is it not?

176
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,472
When he had put on 'Kadhar',
he became a real leader.

177
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:30,774
Sir, that is not Kadhar, it is linen.

178
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:32,275
What Lenin?

179
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,207
Not Lenin, linen,
that is best suited for this hot.

180
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:37,872
Will look like 'Kadhar',
but the thing is class.

181
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:40,340
There are certain, difference
of opinion in the youth wing.

182
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:44,180
To settle that,
Akhilesh has some plans.

183
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:46,178
New generation, is it not?

184
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,380
Must require some strategies.
He is really talented!

185
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:54,140
It looks like; he will reach one step,
higher than the Father.

186
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:56,810
That is how, it should happen.

187
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:33,479
Having been waiting for long?
Heavy block at the Aluva Bridge.

188
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:34,272
Hey you!

189
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:48,876
Johns and Korah!
- Yea.

190
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:51,774
I'm Kunjachan. Got little late.

191
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,640
Innova is at the workshop.

192
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:12,577
Kindly adjust,
no much distance also.

193
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,200
<i>$11224.</i>

194
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:45,446
Will take time, huge block!

195
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,944
Get lost!

196
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,038
August 15th.

197
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,142
Is it not independence day? All
these people are gathered for the rally.

198
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,236
My Mother India!

199
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:39,539
Hey lady! What is it?

200
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:43,206
That is all too expensive.

201
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:45,340
The children are like that,
they will scream, shit...

202
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:46,866
...no enough money to survive.

203
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:48,505
Now she wants cotton
to be placed at the buttocks!

204
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,842
It was wife.

205
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:57,203
Not lovely, Pushpa!

206
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:09,374
Is that not Government vehicle, will
not kill all of a sudden will kill bit by bit.

207
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,774
Get down!

208
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,368
How heavy!

209
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:44,839
Hello...Not that way, this way.

210
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,546
Walk carefully, or else
will be pierced with steel.

211
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:58,944
The way we came is shortcut,
the vehicle will come this way.

212
00:31:00,033 --> 00:31:03,014
Come, this is the house
allotted for your stay.

213
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,007
This area is much of a demanded area.

214
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:24,037
Come here,
why are you standing there?

215
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,913
Come, on comparing
with the rent, this is a Taj Mahal.

216
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,375
Kitchen and bedroom, even though
a small one, it is there, inside.

217
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,702
Then toilet, that is outside.

218
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:39,474
Even when there is no water in the
pipe, nothing to worry, there is well.

219
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:44,410
Though, it is very deep,
water will never be dried.

220
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,704
What is your name, you said?
- Korah.

221
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,878
You can draw the water!

222
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:04,642
You filthy animal, is this your
Dad's property, to use this?

223
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,640
Toilet!

224
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:18,514
Poor fellow only that much
if you want, can pour some water.

225
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:21,908
Hey man, why are you
showing us this house?

226
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,808
- To stay!

227
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:25,370
The food and accommodation
is arranged here.

228
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:27,078
For whom?
- For you!

229
00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:30,177
Got six months' rent,
take the key. Here

230
00:32:56,234 --> 00:32:58,544
Why is Dad handling our
matters so carelessly?

231
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:00,712
The agent arranged by Dad...

232
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:06,703
The car which came to pick up,
you would have run away!

233
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:12,143
And the house given for us, on rent
our dog's den is better than this.

234
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:17,073
Dad had gone for a medical
conference at New Jersey...

235
00:33:17,633 --> 00:33:18,577
I'll call him and tell.

236
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:28,341
Gave the key and he left.

237
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:31,275
Got the key!

238
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
<i>$11224.</i>

239
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,481
Your Dad doesn't know
to arrange a simple thing.

240
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,779
He is the same old guy, who had gone
from here, during the 'bell-bottom times'

241
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,635
Hey bell-bottom!

242
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:23,414
Joe, what is wrong with that house?
A two storied house, within the city.

243
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,907
Have told, got sufficient amenities.

244
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,907
Keralam, is not America, there within the
short notice, only this can be arranged.

245
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:40,542
Anyway let me check it, will arrange
the necessary amenities. Son, Joe...

246
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:52,400
<i>$11224.</i>

247
00:35:54,867 --> 00:35:59,009
Sir, today is the fourth day, right
from yesterday, calling from office.

248
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,777
North Indian parties have booked earlier,
should return the vehicle, by afternoon.

249
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:15,310
Sir, then what should I do?

250
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:21,046
When our new
car is ready, from here...

251
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:23,443
...take the goods from
this car to that car. Okay.

252
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,045
<i>Not 'footy sir, Ooty'.!</i>

253
00:36:56,767 --> 00:37:02,012
Sir, this costly car means BMW, Benz
which one do you want in that?

254
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:03,972
No sir.

255
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,770
Have only, those in the list I told.

256
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:13,444
The high ranged out here
is BMW C4. Will that do?

257
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,905
Usually, only under the guarantee
of some travel agencies...

258
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,502
wears, like these will be given.

259
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,144
I'm giving it in my own personal risk.

260
00:37:35,267 --> 00:37:38,339
Then there is nothing to worry,
on giving it to people like you.

261
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,943
Must give the passport here, must
pay the advance payment that is all.

262
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:45,669
Can't we pay the full
amount as advance?

263
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,543
Where is the trip destined?

264
00:37:52,967 --> 00:37:55,470
To chart the days,
how many days it may take?

265
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:02,544
Now we cannot tell
how many days we will be there.

266
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:05,343
After that, where to?

267
00:38:12,433 --> 00:38:13,207
Is that so?

268
00:38:15,034 --> 00:38:17,014
Sir, this card is not working.

269
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:27,577
Some technical problem
with the bank. Any other card?

270
00:38:33,567 --> 00:38:35,012
This car is of much demand.

271
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:37,975
Sir, key...

272
00:38:57,267 --> 00:39:03,183
Sir, four days bill Rs. 56,000!-
advance Rs. 30,000 balance Rs. 26,000.

273
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,471
From the office it is instructed
should collect as cash.

274
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,571
Samir as I told earlier, if you have
property only then the loan can be given.

275
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,505
Madam some problem
with their NRI account.

276
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:49,146
This Mathew is
he the husband?

277
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,638
- No, Father!

278
00:39:52,534 --> 00:39:54,241
There is no goal keeper at the post!

279
00:39:57,034 --> 00:39:59,913
We came, only last week,
we were busy, traveling...

280
00:40:00,834 --> 00:40:02,814
...when we checked today
some problem in the card.

281
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,175
Maybe some simple error.

282
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,171
Oh! Forgot, what to drink?
Tea or coffee.

283
00:40:15,567 --> 00:40:17,274
Ravi, something cold.

284
00:40:27,434 --> 00:40:29,573
Who is this Issac John?
- My Dad.

285
00:40:32,334 --> 00:40:33,574
He had closed this account!

286
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:38,842
Presently, this account is not there!

<i>$11224.</i>

288
00:41:15,867 --> 00:41:18,245
Actually does your Dad
have some financial crisis?

289
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:27,344
Tell Susan Aunty to divorce
your Dad and marry a rich guy.

290
00:41:27,934 --> 00:41:29,880
I don't find any solution other than that.

291
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,138
That is what your Mama did!

292
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:33,804
But that 'French Pariah'
is not letting me inside!

293
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:40,811
Thampi, as per my calculations things
have to happen in its place, correctly.

294
00:41:41,234 --> 00:41:44,078
That is why, people like you
are employed here.

295
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,537
Joe, son tell me.

296
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:56,174
Today on checking the account,
it seems it is closed.

297
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:57,639
Yes, son.

298
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,449
On checking that account, it had lot
of cash in it, now there is no use of it.

299
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,006
Do you know the meaning of this,
what you said?

300
00:42:12,934 --> 00:42:17,610
Do you know how much money you
had swindled here? 20, 000 Dollars!

301
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:25,072
Son, in our hospital a junior doctor
is not getting this much salary.

302
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,737
In India, living cost is less...

303
00:42:29,867 --> 00:42:34,646
...including food, stay, travel plus
all other expenses, 5,000 bucks.

304
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,474
More than enough!

305
00:42:35,767 --> 00:42:39,237
Only 5, 000 Dollars!
Dad that is not enough!

306
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,139
5, 000 Dollars!
I told 5,000 Rupees! Indian Rupee!

307
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:46,774
Joe, even that is more!

308
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:52,982
The balance, should be spend carefully.
Learn how to manage money.

309
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,446
No text books will come at
par with real life experience!

310
00:43:21,467 --> 00:43:24,505
The Indian plan was Dad's trap Korah!

311
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:25,407
Oxygen?

312
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,470
2,000 Dollars!

313
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,376
When your call came, do you know what
all things came flowing to my mind?

314
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,238
Fish curry at the toddy shop...

315
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,371
...festival at the Kallu Para church,
Pathalam Balan's music show.

316
00:44:18,733 --> 00:44:23,011
2,000 Dollars, Isaac doctor
had told, not to send a penny!

317
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,271
Strict order...

318
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:28,105
...even the amount of urine you are
spilling out there, we get the details here!

319
00:44:28,934 --> 00:44:31,210
The doctor very well knows it,
I'll be the one...

320
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,712
...who will be helping you,
in which ever manner.

321
00:44:34,634 --> 00:44:36,511
Hey, don't you know
the attitude of your Father...

322
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:38,939
...then my manager job will
be at stake! At Kumbanad.

323
00:44:39,567 --> 00:44:44,710
Then, I also, will be at that place,

00:47:21,367 --> 00:47:22,846
That day was also
a full moon was it not?

327
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:25,311

Will there be any nude
beach like that in India?

330
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,977

I tried to tune that beach...

Half earth distance from here to US.

Here, there is no one to
control us is it not Korah?

335
00:49:17,834 --> 00:49:19,040
No one to help also.

336
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,846
To go back
at least we need, 2,000 Dollars.

337
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:31,709
Whom to ask? Who would give?
You had disgusted all of them.

338
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,177
Who? Me?
- No...Me!

At least if there were
1000 Dollars, I would have gone!

340
00:49:43,267 --> 00:49:43,938
Then what about me?

341
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:45,803

00:49:45,867 --> 00:49:46,937
For that, I'll go,
does it make any difference?

For that why do you want to scare,
by speaking English?

390
00:55:35,434 --> 00:55:38,574
If it is 'no' means no need,
I can very well control for a day.

Want girls?

College going items are there.
- What?

397
00:56:13,467 --> 00:56:16,846
No what, and where is!
Ladies, but it has to be night.

398
00:56:17,067 --> 00:56:18,307
They will wear the nighty and come.

Can you give me some paper'?
- Only your passport left as paper.

This bloody Indian closet,
which ass-ole had invented this!

403
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:47,146
One hole and this kind of sitting.

404
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:54,006
Will create lot of problem
if it does not fall in to this hole exactly!

405
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,876
By the time you break your legs,
banging go and fetch some water!

406
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,080
Hi, we had come for BPL survey.

00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,177
How much is your annual income?

412
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,378
Can tell your Father's.

413
00:57:55,467 --> 00:57:56,946
Joe, water!

414
00:57:57,934 --> 00:58:00,540
Look, we have to visit lot of houses...

415
00:58:00,634 --> 00:58:03,046
...be cooperative,
all the findings should be exact.

416
00:58:06,967 --> 00:58:09,277
Johns...will anything turn out!

417
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:25,377
Sister, will go!

418
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,777
Joe, what's going on there,
are you free after roaming around?

419
00:58:44,134 --> 00:58:45,875
Here, we are just wasting the time.

420
00:58:47,234 --> 00:58:50,909
Is that all, that can be
taken care of, where is Korah?

421
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,612
He is here.
Hey man Dad!

422
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:56,037
Are you both listening?

423
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,604
What is your program,
tomorrow morning at 9: 30?

424
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,278
It will be somewhat
3 to 3.5 kilometers...

425
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,438
...to Allocious College,
from where you are staying.

426
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,276
Then by around 8:30 in the morning...

427
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:17,311
...both of you get ready
and go to that college.

428
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,378
For what uncle?

429
00:59:18,934 --> 00:59:21,244
By tomorrow itself, you are joining there.

430
00:59:24,434 --> 00:59:26,380
The class had already started,
two weeks back.

431
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:27,777
You people are already late.

432
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,040
What we? Uncle, why should I go!

433
00:59:31,567 --> 00:59:34,173
I had arranged there,
your admission also.

434
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:40,408
Then who will go to
Melbourne University?

435
00:59:40,767 --> 00:59:44,112
Don't you know the land called
Keralam, is the biggest University?

436
00:59:44,367 --> 00:59:47,109
When you study there,
you will pass, anywhere in the world.

437
00:59:53,800 --> 01:00:00,046
Then...What will...We!
- You will study there! And pass!

438
01:00:00,467 --> 01:00:02,606
No, we'll not go to class!

439
01:00:03,034 --> 01:00:05,139
Don't bunk your classes.

440
01:00:05,367 --> 01:00:09,747
Then there will be a short fall in
five thousand which I promised.

441
01:00:11,633 --> 01:00:16,207
Then, only when you study and succeed,
only then you can come here.

442
01:00:20,234 --> 01:00:24,148
Even if you take, any number
of years, I'll not say anything!

443
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,247
So, tomorrow morning 9:30
Allocious College.

444
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,380
Thampi, take the statement of the
account which is closed, do not forget.

445
01:00:58,167 --> 01:01:04,118
Know, we are little late, past is past,
now this is the right time.

446
01:01:04,434 --> 01:01:07,313
They will flourish in this, I'm sure!

447
01:01:15,767 --> 01:01:17,542
Had expected,
will wash only on going back.

448
01:01:21,667 --> 01:01:22,737
It is all because of you.

449
01:01:24,367 --> 01:01:26,813
You are the one wearing the
underwear, and not washing it.

450
01:01:26,967 --> 01:01:28,344
Then, all the blame is on me.

451
01:01:28,834 --> 01:01:30,643
Who was the one,
who banged on that black's ball!

452
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:31,438
Is it me?

453
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,873
Then who broke
the strap of his girlfriend?

454
01:01:33,967 --> 01:01:34,672
Is it me?

455
01:01:35,867 --> 01:01:38,279
Is it me who got aroused and
jumped, on hearing India?

456
01:01:41,634 --> 01:01:44,581
I'll do as I like! Who are you, who
told you to come, without asking?

457
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:46,575
Your Father! That fraud!

458
01:01:46,767 --> 01:01:48,838

01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,440
You wait and see, I'll wear under
garments only once I reach there!

462
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,242
Stop there man!

463
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,938
Buddy what is it, should I interfere?

464
01:02:35,067 --> 01:02:36,842
Buddy what is this avoiding like?

465
01:02:38,567 --> 01:02:40,911
After all, don't we
have a relationship?

466
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,603
What relationship?
- Relation, during shitting!

467
01:02:46,334 --> 01:02:48,473
I can do what I can buddy!

468
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,411
We need one lakh rupees,
can you give that?

469
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:58,238
Will do it, by night,
by around eight, eight thirty!

470
01:03:00,567 --> 01:03:03,446
Can be arranged buddy
but there is risk involved.

471
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:05,141
Whatever case it may be,
can the cash be obtained?

472
01:03:05,367 --> 01:03:07,210
On giving hundred,
will get two hundred.

473
01:03:07,667 --> 01:03:09,408
On giving fifty thousand,
will receive one lakh!

474
01:03:09,867 --> 01:03:11,244
A matter of doubling.

475
01:03:14,234 --> 01:03:16,908
Just because of your help,
'morning rituals' are taking place...

476
01:03:17,267 --> 01:03:18,644
...just consider as a gratitude for that!

477
01:03:21,167 --> 01:03:23,374
Have fifty,
will return as one in the evening?

478
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:26,336
Dude leave it, if not trusted!

479
01:03:41,934 --> 01:03:44,039
Do we have to trust
that black fool Korah?

480
01:03:45,134 --> 01:03:48,672
We've taken the decision,
sold the laptop and got the money!

481
01:03:48,934 --> 01:03:52,279
That laptop is worth of 3,000 Dollars,
just sold it for 50,000 Rupees!

482
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,440
With this cash either one of us
can go, let's just try that.

483
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,176
Will go back, will drop this plan.

484
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:05,411
But with this cash I'll be the one going,
after reaching there, I'll take you!

485
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:07,838
If that is the case, I'll go first!

486
01:04:12,367 --> 01:04:13,744
If at all going, will go together.

487
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,181
Must show them, for those who
thought we will never return.

488
01:04:24,267 --> 01:04:25,837
This Johns and Korah,
who they really are!

489
01:04:27,233 --> 01:04:29,975
Bloody pariah dogs
we are coming back!

490
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,671
How long are we waiting for porridge?

491
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:57,616
Buddy what is this, where were you?

492
01:04:57,767 --> 01:04:59,110
Don't have any responsibility!

493
01:04:59,534 --> 01:05:02,447
Want one is it not? - Yes.
Do you have fifty with you?

494
01:05:06,334 --> 01:05:09,008
They are all regular customers
out here. You come, buddies!

495
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:18,904
You stay here, give that money.

496
01:05:38,967 --> 01:05:41,777
Hey! Who is that? Is it Ambili?

497
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,638
Who?
- Korah!

498
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,138
What kind of a ridiculous name is that?

499
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,642
Not good enough!
Who is there, along with you?

500
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:57,639
John's!
- That is good, a nice name.

501
01:06:03,934 --> 01:06:05,709
Mother, I'll go out and come.

502
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:10,909
If you go out...Who will smash chewing
leaves for me...Will your Father come!

503
01:06:13,567 --> 01:06:14,841
That lady is mad!

504
01:06:14,967 --> 01:06:16,742
Your Father is mad!
- Get lost!

505
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:21,640
Buddy here you go,
one lakh at your service!

506
01:06:21,767 --> 01:06:23,007
Counting and all after you reach home.

507
01:06:28,134 --> 01:06:29,169
That was not required!

508
01:06:31,967 --> 01:06:35,710
After all, what is this? For the needy
I have arranged even the kidney!

509
01:06:37,434 --> 01:06:39,778
Go and come back after visiting
Madurai, Ooty, Palani and all.

510
01:06:41,067 --> 01:06:43,673
Then, don't give this to the bank!

511
01:06:45,233 --> 01:06:47,406
Why?
- What why?

512
01:06:47,934 --> 01:06:52,041
Only the Gandhi's picture is original,
the note is flake! Truly flake!

513
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,474
When caught by the police,
will be inside!

514
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,944
Not only you, me too!

515
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:04,506
Why do you want this money for?
- To go to America!

516
01:07:13,167 --> 01:07:15,841
Then what, what madness
are you talking about?

517
01:07:16,134 --> 01:07:18,136
No doubt will be behind the bars!

518
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,871
Is this money not for you
to roam around and freak out!

519
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:29,535
Get our money back!

520
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,241
Don't take the
measurement of my neck!

521
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,338
The money which is given,
can't be taken back!

522
01:07:38,634 --> 01:07:40,170
I've not cheated anybody...

523
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,904
...morning I told, there is risk,
and it is doubling case and all.

524
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,938
Here comes police...

525
01:07:49,334 --> 01:07:54,716
...then what did Mammotty do?
What a great comedy it was!

526
01:07:58,367 --> 01:07:59,107
Buddy!

527
01:08:03,467 --> 01:08:05,708
Then what should I do?
What are you guys saying?

528
01:08:05,867 --> 01:08:07,642
We want our money back!

529
01:08:07,734 --> 01:08:09,270
Again and again,
repeating the same thing!

530
01:08:09,667 --> 01:08:12,876
Those guys cleaning the vessels, at
least they have ten stabbing cases!

531
01:08:13,133 --> 01:08:14,942
I'm going, hear that!

532
01:08:35,867 --> 01:08:45,220
Who are you, hey catch him!
Come! He harassed me! Catch him!

533
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:56,603
Leave me!

534
01:09:18,734 --> 01:09:19,439
Korah!

535
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:30,638
Go man!

536
01:09:43,467 --> 01:09:50,248
Come fast, fast, my money, you pariahs!

537
01:10:09,634 --> 01:10:10,339
Korah!

538
01:10:11,134 --> 01:10:11,908
Leave!

539
01:10:12,967 --> 01:10:15,504
Time up, don't beat!

540
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,646
You should have gone with that money,
and then you might have taken me.

541
01:11:00,134 --> 01:11:03,980
No, you, should have gone!

542
01:11:04,467 --> 01:11:07,471
Is it not that? You dog, I told
thousand times, that I will go, I will go!

543
01:11:10,034 --> 01:11:11,604
If it is college,
then carry on with college!

544
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:15,282
Buddy! There is one more possibility
of getting the original notes!

545
01:11:19,767 --> 01:11:20,745
Can you give kidneys!

546
01:11:22,667 --> 01:11:24,010
My Mother!

547
01:11:53,467 --> 01:12:00,681
Uncle! The bus, via Allocious College!

548
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,973
Don't you know to
read Malayalam, is it not?

549
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:11,600
<i>$11224.</i>

550
01:12:57,267 --> 01:12:58,644
I will get the vehicle to
the show room by evening.

551
01:12:59,067 --> 01:13:01,104
Let this, week's episode
go on like this.

552
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:04,414
Then tell the producer, if there is
shoot, prior notice must be given.

553
01:13:05,767 --> 01:13:06,438
Fine!

554
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:28,380
Where to?
- Allocious College. Appa...Cious!

555
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,070
I'm not heading that way!

556
01:13:32,267 --> 01:13:34,838
Appa...Applied Science!

557
01:13:42,734 --> 01:13:44,611
Pop in, I'll drop!

558
01:14:06,601 --> 01:14:07,739
Have heard a lot!

559
01:14:08,367 --> 01:14:09,778
When and where?

560
01:14:10,067 --> 01:14:11,740
Yesterday from the toilet!

561
01:14:18,267 --> 01:14:19,211
I'm Madhu Mitha.

562
01:14:19,934 --> 01:14:21,106
Madhu Mathi, nice name!

563
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:25,504
Yea, Madhu Vidhu (Honey moon)
No, Madhi Muddu!

564
01:14:25,767 --> 01:14:26,472
Enough of it!

565
01:14:29,767 --> 01:14:33,271
Looks like, this gentleman has not
done over with that trouble so far!

566
01:14:38,367 --> 01:14:42,747
Are you really from States?
Is it any kind of built up!

567
01:14:48,367 --> 01:14:49,368
We've got passport and all!

568
01:14:50,634 --> 01:14:52,705
I have believed
then how come here!

569
01:14:55,934 --> 01:14:59,677
Story means is there stunt,
chase villain, things like that.

570
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:00,939
Everything is there!

571
01:15:01,034 --> 01:15:05,210
Is it so? - Yes.
- Then don't tell, will be bored!

572
01:15:15,067 --> 01:15:16,478
Okay, everything is acknowledged!

573
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,778
Hey you! Get out of my car!

574
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:51,543
Did you get scared?
Sister was just conning!

575
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,470
Are you studying here?

576
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:03,842
Why, why not? Do we have
to change that, can change!

577
01:16:11,601 --> 01:16:14,309
We are now learning
about money exchange.

578
01:16:14,934 --> 01:16:18,643
But now I'm going to tell
about yet another exchange.

579
01:16:18,767 --> 01:16:22,340
A cultural exchange,
an Indo -American partnership.

580
01:16:22,767 --> 01:16:27,182
Two Malayalee's who are not Indians,
from now on, they are with us.

581
01:16:27,767 --> 01:16:31,943
We learn from them and
they learn from us, lot of things.

582
01:16:50,401 --> 01:16:55,401
<i>$11224.</i>

583
01:17:25,267 --> 01:17:28,680
Friends! Our friend Meena
Ramachandran, who had secured...

584
01:17:28,801 --> 01:17:32,943
...a merit seat for MBA, had
attempted for a suicide as you know.

585
01:17:33,101 --> 01:17:35,138
Meena had done that on
account of, rising college fees...

586
01:17:35,201 --> 01:17:37,181
...which is hiked with whims and fancies.

587
01:17:37,767 --> 01:17:40,941
She had escaped just because of luck.
Today she is at the hospital bed.

588
01:17:41,267 --> 01:17:43,247
Our campus life
will be complete only...

589
01:17:43,334 --> 01:17:45,837
...when we study with
the energetic persons like her.

590
01:17:46,334 --> 01:17:49,474
This is not a so called strike,
be human...

591
01:17:49,667 --> 01:17:52,477
...since it is our responsibility
that Meena must study with us...

592
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:54,672
...today we are
boycotting today's class.

593
01:18:13,234 --> 01:18:17,478
To whom did you ask to stop the class?
Who gave you permission for that?

594
01:18:17,567 --> 01:18:18,944
Sir, it was on
account of increasing the fees.

595
01:18:19,034 --> 01:18:20,877
Is it written anywhere, she
consumed poison on account of that!

596
01:18:21,234 --> 01:18:22,713
May be some love affair,
or some kind of pregnancy.

597
01:18:22,867 --> 01:18:24,744
For these issues, the class
cannot be discontinued.

598
01:18:24,934 --> 01:18:27,210
Had invested two crores
to construct the auditorium.

599
01:18:27,301 --> 01:18:28,780
I'm the one who is
answerable to the Father.

600
01:18:29,401 --> 01:18:32,143
Then, somehow managed
the TV and news personals.

601
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:35,374
Those students were told to come.

602
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,036
Oh! Leaders.

603
01:18:38,434 --> 01:18:41,142
So remember what have told,
classes must go on.

604
01:18:46,034 --> 01:18:47,536
I don't want to listen to any excuses.

605
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:51,075
Is that enough!

606
01:18:51,167 --> 01:18:53,511
Sir, only you have to tell,
what the management stand is?

607
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,137
Meena Ramachandran
had not died, had survived...

608
01:18:56,234 --> 01:18:59,147
...and for attempting suicide there
must be some personal matters.

609
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:01,041
What can college
management do on that?

610
01:19:01,134 --> 01:19:05,014
Every person is attempting to suicide,
based on personal problems.

611
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,639
Here, everyone knows
what Meena's problem is.

612
01:19:10,267 --> 01:19:11,940
Is there any problems that
cannot be resolved on talking?

613
01:19:14,967 --> 01:19:17,072
Management, will never trouble you.

614
01:19:17,601 --> 01:19:18,978
Sir, hard to believe!

615
01:19:20,167 --> 01:19:23,148
I will take up the expense of Meena
Ramachandran on carrying on...

616
01:19:23,234 --> 01:19:25,771
...with her studies and
also her hospital expenses.

617
01:19:26,534 --> 01:19:27,911
Our party will take up the matter.

618
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,607
See, we do not intend to take up
this as, bracketed as, a party issue.

619
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:33,738
Can you give any
assurance for preventing...

620
01:19:33,834 --> 01:19:35,404
...rocketing increase of college fees?

621
01:19:39,167 --> 01:19:41,647
Are you doing some kind
of car shows on TV, is it not?

622
01:19:42,567 --> 01:19:45,047
Dear, you might be the one,
who had informed the channels.

623
01:19:45,934 --> 01:19:47,106
I had submerged that!

624
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:51,315
Let us know what you have
decided. Only when it is positive.

625
01:19:57,901 --> 01:20:00,438
We must not fall prey to girl's apple.

626
01:20:01,667 --> 01:20:02,338
Apple?

627
01:20:02,434 --> 01:20:04,175
Even Adam fell prey to apple.

628
01:20:04,367 --> 01:20:08,440
From that day the problems had started,
you must control on seeing girl's apple!

629
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,145
What did I do for that?

630
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,578
When that girl was
preaching something...

631
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:14,804
...why did you make, 'the eyes as bulb'
and leave the place like that and go?

632
01:20:14,967 --> 01:20:16,412
Then, what?
Must we, be alone in the class?

633
01:20:16,634 --> 01:20:19,376
If there is no attendance, the cash will
not fall in to accounts, do you know that?

634
01:20:21,134 --> 01:20:23,740
If we could get one lakh as a lost
money, would have escaped!

635
01:20:24,001 --> 01:20:27,244
From where?
Whom to ask? Who will give?

636
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:31,443
Are you trying to flee in between,
leave what is in your hand and go!

637
01:20:31,534 --> 01:20:32,512
Will get man!

638
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:34,670
Hey drop and go man!

639
01:20:35,334 --> 01:20:39,976
Will get balls! Only hundred bugs in
hand, not even money to buy burger!

640
01:20:44,467 --> 01:20:46,344
Put the money and go!

641
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,038
Dude no need, from her
character, she is your Dad's sister!

642
01:20:51,267 --> 01:20:52,541
Cannot be predicted!

643
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:03,671
Million Dollar babies had come at
the right time! Put your contributions.

644
01:21:06,734 --> 01:21:08,975
This is the fund to discharge Meera
Ramachandran from the hospital.

645
01:21:09,434 --> 01:21:11,277
We do not have
anything in the form of cash.

646
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:13,210
May be in Dollars,
never mind, put that also.

647
01:21:13,534 --> 01:21:14,512
Can we put tomorrow?

648
01:21:14,667 --> 01:21:16,704
Got enough money to secure an
admission on NRI seat, is it not?

649
01:21:16,867 --> 01:21:17,641
Hey put it man!

650
01:21:27,301 --> 01:21:28,041
Mathumitha...

651
01:21:29,034 --> 01:21:31,173
I just wanted to enquire a thing.

652
01:21:31,801 --> 01:21:32,541
Go on!

653
01:21:35,634 --> 01:21:38,171
That is because!
- What is because?

654
01:21:38,267 --> 01:21:40,338
Like!
- Like, what?

655
01:21:40,467 --> 01:21:42,947
Our Meera Ramachandran...

656
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:50,545
No problem with her.
But son has got some problem!

657
01:21:50,734 --> 01:21:56,810
Me? - Yea.
- No. - Yes, there is!

658
01:21:57,667 --> 01:21:59,078
Really, I came to ask about Meera.

659
01:21:59,167 --> 01:22:03,138
We are now going to hospital, if you
come there, you can know the matters.

660
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,341
There she goes with the apple!

661
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:27,671
Brother here!

662
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,843
I've got lot of purchase...

663
01:22:40,067 --> 01:22:43,640
...toilet papers, some creams,
had enough of using this hand.

664
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:47,839
Will give you, your share, you can
do whatever you want with that!

665
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:53,407
So, that is 2,500 each!

666
01:22:53,634 --> 01:22:59,744
That means eighty
something rupees per day!

667
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:08,382
<i>$11224.</i>

668
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,939
How can we live with this amount?

669
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:20,347
From today onwards in our life,
there must be clear planning.

670
01:23:21,667 --> 01:23:25,615
Now itself, the balance for this tea,
you have collected it by counting it.

671
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:29,113
Likewise we must think every
rupee, before we spent.

672
01:23:30,001 --> 01:23:35,001
<i>$11224.</i>

673
01:23:43,934 --> 01:23:45,208
Take one 60!

674
01:23:47,467 --> 01:23:49,174
This one too!

675
01:23:49,367 --> 01:23:50,141
Yup!

676
01:23:50,267 --> 01:23:52,975
Like this, one or two times in
a month. That is enough!

677
01:24:01,367 --> 01:24:02,243
Sir, do you want some more?

678
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:08,000
<i>$11224.</i>

679
01:24:30,767 --> 01:24:34,271
This me, should be seeing pole
dancing at the pussy cat longue!

680
01:24:36,467 --> 01:24:39,311
Nissan's first hatch back in India.

681
01:24:39,467 --> 01:24:40,946
Hey, there she is,
That Madhu Mitha!

682
01:24:41,067 --> 01:24:43,445
Here!
On the TV.

683
01:24:44,567 --> 01:24:47,173
Had used clear lens head lamps,

684
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:51,112
so will give better visibility
for the driver at night.

685
01:24:51,234 --> 01:24:54,215
You are the one who gave
my hundred rupees to her.

686
01:24:54,334 --> 01:24:57,144
Because of her, this Korah
was starved today afternoon!

687
01:24:58,101 --> 01:25:00,547
I want it back now!

688
01:25:05,067 --> 01:25:11,177
Your game! For that is she a girl? If
so, why can she grow the hair in length?

689
01:25:11,867 --> 01:25:14,871
On looking closely, can
see the mustache also!

690
01:25:15,034 --> 01:25:19,949
But should look closely.
I'm sure, she is the male!

691
01:25:21,634 --> 01:25:24,672
She has not recognized us,
who we really are, that is why.

692
01:25:30,467 --> 01:25:32,947
Today we will make her to respect!

693
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:42,339
The Finance Minister was
hospitalized at the sea shore hospital,

694
01:25:42,501 --> 01:25:43,775
due to heart attack.

695
01:25:43,934 --> 01:25:47,177
On the occasion of electing the
son, Akhilesh Varma as the

696
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:52,841
president of the youth wing,
Ravi Varma had discomfort.

697
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,777
Within the three months it is the
second time, he is being hospitalized

698
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,402
due to heart related issues.

699
01:25:58,567 --> 01:26:01,138
Air this news just like this, if
anything more is required,

700
01:26:01,267 --> 01:26:02,974
I will discuss with sir and tell you.

701
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:07,878
I can't understand why did Father
take up such a plan like this?

702
01:26:08,101 --> 01:26:12,811
Son, you leave it, if sir does one
thing it will have lot of intentions.

703
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:15,641
Once we crystalize in mind,
he will see up there!

704
01:26:17,767 --> 01:26:23,217
Lot of activist like this, dressed
in cotton and with a jute bag!

705
01:26:23,367 --> 01:26:26,644
Hey girl! We've decided, what
to do on the issue of Meera.

706
01:26:26,734 --> 01:26:27,940
Hey! Who is this 'we'?

707
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,376
Students union
when did that rapture!

708
01:26:31,501 --> 01:26:33,606
Don't try to show off!

709
01:26:33,701 --> 01:26:36,910
Do you have an official
representation of students?

710
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:40,810
You get the Akhilesh's money
and eat! Not of our concern!

711
01:26:40,934 --> 01:26:43,346
The problem, is on the fees
of poor student's here.

712
01:26:43,467 --> 01:26:45,242
When Akhilesh sir told, would
pay the Meena's fees,

713
01:26:45,334 --> 01:26:46,574
you are one, who told, no.

714
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:47,270
Yes, I did!

715
01:26:47,367 --> 01:26:49,108
But Meena's family wants that!

716
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,580
They have agreed, collected the
money also from tomorrow onwards

717
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:54,304
she will start coming
to college also.

718
01:27:03,434 --> 01:27:05,311
Enough, of your, one man operation!

719
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,644
There are other males,
to intervene in this!

720
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:16,813
America, you don't interfere in this.
Leave and go to where you came from!

721
01:27:22,567 --> 01:27:25,343
This son had come,
not just to walk off like that!

722
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:28,978
What is the problem? ls Meena
having any other ailments?

723
01:27:29,567 --> 01:27:33,037
So ABCD's have come to
probe in to the problem, is it?

724
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,080
You people, are not
even Indian citizens,

725
01:27:43,267 --> 01:27:45,907
this is the matter of indigents, who
doesn't have money to pay the fees.

726
01:27:46,034 --> 01:27:47,138
Are you like that?

727
01:27:47,234 --> 01:27:47,939
If so?

728
01:27:48,034 --> 01:27:51,379
What hunger in America?
Porridge for Obama also!

729
01:27:51,467 --> 01:27:54,866
Have you people ever starved,
ever lived without food?

730
01:27:54,867 --> 01:27:59,441
That is all another item man!
Have you guys, heard of that?

731
01:27:59,567 --> 01:28:01,547
Morning itself, your bed
coffee and all your...

732
01:28:02,167 --> 01:28:06,172
Bed Coffee, we never used to
take that, saving rupees three!

733
01:28:06,367 --> 01:28:08,608
Lilly Hotel at Pullepadi, Rs.8!

734
01:28:08,734 --> 01:28:10,145
If you cross the railway
gate and walk,

735
01:28:10,234 --> 01:28:11,372
will reach college within
thirty minutes!

736
01:28:11,434 --> 01:28:13,311
No waiting for the bus, no
hassles, no need to stand,

737
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:14,208
no need to take tickets.

738
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,677
Walking is good for health!

739
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:21,842
Lunch at Neethi canteen
porridge and beans! Rs.10!

740
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:25,814
At 4, by the road, black tea, with
sugar, 3, without, 2, no snacks!

741
01:28:25,901 --> 01:28:26,936
That is cut!

742
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,776
Then, dinner, at the road
side eateries, Porotta, 4,

743
01:28:29,834 --> 01:28:33,111
...for daily customers, 3, beef
may be free, on getting peas,

744
01:28:33,167 --> 01:28:34,339
...it is lottery, life just like that.

745
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:38,314
So, when you control like
that per day Rs. 83/- in total.

746
01:28:43,167 --> 01:28:46,080
So don't teach hunger!

747
01:28:46,167 --> 01:28:48,306
Have you both,
come to study hunger?

748
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,435
What does it matter, if so?

749
01:28:49,534 --> 01:28:51,036
Hey man! Don't point and speak!

750
01:28:58,134 --> 01:29:01,980
All this arguments and noise
at a hospital, go, all of you!

751
01:29:02,034 --> 01:29:04,033
Are you not ashamed,
like small babies!

752
01:29:04,034 --> 01:29:05,342
Is it for this, you all came here?

753
01:29:05,467 --> 01:29:06,241
Go!

754
01:29:13,667 --> 01:29:15,578
When have you
decided to come to India?

755
01:29:15,667 --> 01:29:16,372
That is when...

756
01:29:18,567 --> 01:29:22,379
My childhood was in a crowded
city of New Yolk in a big house.

757
01:29:34,467 --> 01:29:38,813
A childhood where I was not
attended, though I had everyone.

758
01:29:41,967 --> 01:29:45,540
To me Father was the
screams in that house!

759
01:30:03,167 --> 01:30:05,704
In that big house, I was lone!

760
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,074
I was also alone!

761
01:30:07,167 --> 01:30:09,511
Yes, we both, alone!

762
01:30:10,667 --> 01:30:13,147
I saw Dad's smiling face only when,

763
01:30:13,201 --> 01:30:15,579
money was over flown in the
balance sheet of the business.

764
01:30:17,167 --> 01:30:20,205
Dad always loved, money and Dad!

765
01:30:23,534 --> 01:30:27,175
Never have i watched even one
scene between Dad and Mom!

766
01:30:36,767 --> 01:30:38,007
When I grew up,

767
01:30:38,067 --> 01:30:41,378
the classes at college and text
books were only our relief.

768
01:30:41,467 --> 01:30:45,347
We tried to forget everything by
concentrating fully on studies.

769
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:50,144
After securing lot of ranks
we were not satisfied at all!

770
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:55,710
But Dad was parting
more and more from our paths!

771
01:30:57,601 --> 01:31:02,601
<i>$11224.</i>

772
01:31:19,367 --> 01:31:22,143
It was during this time, we
turned on to the activism.

773
01:31:22,767 --> 01:31:26,078
The problems of ordinary
men and their life!

774
01:31:28,067 --> 01:31:31,378
We stroked a lot for
the starving blacks!

775
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:39,378
I had to allot full of my time
to solve my Dad's problems!

776
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:48,337
When we came to know that even
the prayers cannot save Dad,

777
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:55,012
we left behind that city and
all the luxuries.

778
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:56,238
To India!

779
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:02,879
Dad still, calls us to return...

780
01:32:03,667 --> 01:32:08,616
but the low profiled life, as we
longed, the little happiness in it.

781
01:32:09,067 --> 01:32:14,073
That is what we experience here,
to you, it may sound like fairy tale!

782
01:32:15,001 --> 01:32:18,505
It is not to prove it to anyone, we
live like this. No one to be defeated also.

783
01:32:18,834 --> 01:32:21,440
If you want you can
check our bank balance.

784
01:32:22,134 --> 01:32:23,772
Madhu Mitha knows our house.

785
01:32:26,101 --> 01:32:27,444
If you want you can also come.

786
01:32:30,801 --> 01:32:32,974
Take this, might be needy!

787
01:32:48,101 --> 01:32:51,412
Did it goof-up? Did work out?

788
01:32:52,801 --> 01:32:57,801
<i>$11224.</i>

789
01:33:45,234 --> 01:33:48,010
Finance Minister
K P Ravi Varma expired.

790
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:52,139
Death was by evening seven
o'clock, due to heart attack.

791
01:33:52,234 --> 01:33:54,009
Pertaining to which, he was
undergoing treatment...

792
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:57,741
in a private hospital. Upon his
death, ends the political life

793
01:33:57,801 --> 01:33:59,678
that spreads over thirty years.

794
01:33:59,734 --> 01:34:05,548
Ravi Varma's son and president of
the party's youth wing, Akhilesh Varma...

795
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,666
I, Akhilesh Varma will solemnly
abide and follow the constitution of India,

796
01:34:09,667 --> 01:34:12,341
...as directed by the law.

797
01:34:12,467 --> 01:34:14,947
Will discharge the duties to
the best of my consciousness,

798
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,776
will strive without fear, favoritism ,
unbiased, and will undertake justice

799
01:34:17,867 --> 01:34:20,973
to men from all walks of life

800
01:34:21,034 --> 01:34:23,480
I solemnly, take the
pledge in the name of God.

801
01:34:23,634 --> 01:34:26,877
Then within three months,
by election will take place,

802
01:34:26,934 --> 01:34:30,143
Government is ruling is out, only on
the strength of majority of single

803
01:34:30,201 --> 01:34:31,271
seat don't you know that?

804
01:34:31,334 --> 01:34:33,499
After thirty year of ruling
Ravi Varma had obtained

805
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:37,243
only the majority of mere 3000 Votes.

806
01:34:38,067 --> 01:34:40,138
Time had exceeded
to come to the forefront.

807
01:34:40,267 --> 01:34:42,747
There are certain small opponents
within the party circle,

808
01:34:42,867 --> 01:34:46,440
for solemnizing before the
completion, of my Father's death rituals.

809
01:34:46,534 --> 01:34:50,778
Father's 16th day demise! Apart
from death rituals, undertaken...

810
01:34:50,867 --> 01:34:53,939
the Ravi's soul, is longing
to see you as a minister.

811
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,447
Long before, a Bishmachariya
in Kerala politics,

812
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,741
his son was made to minister like this

813
01:34:59,834 --> 01:35:03,008
Then what happened for the by
election, the people gave a great blow!

814
01:35:03,101 --> 01:35:03,943
I know sir.

815
01:35:04,034 --> 01:35:06,139
Don't think we are
underestimating you.

816
01:35:06,767 --> 01:35:09,873
There is a foul tendency
among the mass of Kerala,

817
01:35:09,934 --> 01:35:13,905
to vote against those who
rule. Should be careful.

818
01:35:16,034 --> 01:35:19,743
If we ask money from local guardian
I fear your Dad may come to know that.

819
01:35:20,434 --> 01:35:24,314
This is our last chance, must come
back at least with fifty thousand!

820
01:35:27,434 --> 01:35:34,044
Come here! Too bad that you do not
know the address of local guardian.

821
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:36,706
American is it not,
that is why, it is like this!

822
01:35:38,934 --> 01:35:40,072
Are you going like that?

823
01:35:40,167 --> 01:35:43,614
Give some perfume, let's us
also have some spray and all!

824
01:35:59,467 --> 01:36:02,710
Do you know this
Kumbannad? Thiruvella!

825
01:36:06,067 --> 01:36:07,671
How many kilometers from here?

826
01:36:07,967 --> 01:36:12,780
One kilometers,
one hundred kilometers!

827
01:36:14,467 --> 01:36:15,946
Will it be a hard drive?

828
01:36:17,367 --> 01:36:18,937
Beauty will it not be!

829
01:36:21,067 --> 01:36:22,444
What are, you children's problem?

830
01:36:23,867 --> 01:36:25,005
Must go to local guardian's place.

831
01:36:25,067 --> 01:36:25,772
Go on!

832
01:36:25,834 --> 01:36:26,904
Don't know the way.

833
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,913
These are all the chances,
can catch a bus and go!

834
01:36:29,967 --> 01:36:30,775
Will vomit!

835
01:36:30,934 --> 01:36:32,971
Came to study the life
of the poor, is it not?

836
01:36:33,067 --> 01:36:35,104
Get in carrying a plastic pouch!

837
01:36:37,001 --> 01:36:37,638
Okay then.

838
01:36:43,334 --> 01:36:44,870
Then, happy journey!

839
01:37:00,734 --> 01:37:05,444
Buddy I'm Mathu Mitha,
where are you children?

840
01:37:06,401 --> 01:37:08,745
On the bus, on the
way to Kumbanad.

841
01:37:08,834 --> 01:37:15,080
Then come back immediately, there
are two thief's sleeping in your room!

842
01:37:21,767 --> 01:37:24,873
Are not ashamed to tell lies,
empty stomached?

843
01:37:41,567 --> 01:37:42,841
Who is there of yours at Kumbanad?

844
01:37:43,667 --> 01:37:47,137
Tell the truth! Will only speak
lie, when you use tongue!

845
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:50,777
Dad's house.
Ancestral house!

846
01:37:51,867 --> 01:37:55,542
I've got a UNICEF program
today, not as much as you people,

847
01:37:55,767 --> 01:37:59,237
can't get sleep without doing at
least one charity work, a day.

848
01:38:00,867 --> 01:38:03,746
So my own scorers key,

849
01:38:04,067 --> 01:38:06,638
no need to wait for the bus,
no hassles, no queues!

850
01:38:09,334 --> 01:38:11,575
But must pour petrol and the vehicle

851
01:38:11,667 --> 01:38:13,647
should be handed over,
tomorrow morning at home.

852
01:38:16,634 --> 01:38:22,607
Madhu Mitha! Is she a girl? If so,
why can she grow the hair in length?

853
01:38:22,667 --> 01:38:27,548
On looking closely, can see the
mustache also! But should look closely!

854
01:38:33,001 --> 01:38:38,001
<i>$11224.</i>

855
01:39:14,601 --> 01:39:16,103
Which is this Murikkan
Parambil House?

856
01:39:16,167 --> 01:39:17,077
This is the one.

857
01:39:36,667 --> 01:39:41,047
Brother, someone is coming under
the pretext, it is Kalamandalam!

858
01:39:41,167 --> 01:39:43,943
Not yet learned, have
been drumming for long!

859
01:39:44,067 --> 01:39:48,277
This is not, your kind of
knocking, this is art. Is it not?

860
01:39:48,534 --> 01:39:51,845
Good if you go to America,
will be a really a good show!

861
01:39:52,234 --> 01:39:53,713
What is his worry!

862
01:39:53,767 --> 01:39:55,041
No medicine for this!

863
01:39:55,134 --> 01:39:56,545
Hubby, don't bother,
carry on drumming!

864
01:40:10,101 --> 01:40:13,173
I'm John's... Issac John's at America.

865
01:40:16,767 --> 01:40:17,768
My God!

866
01:40:30,367 --> 01:40:32,347
Then what are the
news in America?

867
01:40:33,434 --> 01:40:37,177
How is brother in law, still
with that wig and all?

868
01:40:39,067 --> 01:40:43,914
I also like ducts, but the son
Sebastian doesn't take ducks.

869
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,378
He will only take KPSC's chicken.

870
01:40:47,601 --> 01:40:48,773
KPSC?

871
01:40:48,901 --> 01:40:50,437
Man KFC?

872
01:40:51,601 --> 01:40:54,047
That is the one, when you go to
America, will only get stuff like this,

873
01:40:54,134 --> 01:40:55,010
is it not?

874
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:58,809
Yes, all the com patriots are jealous!

875
01:40:59,967 --> 01:41:00,911
For what?

876
01:41:01,701 --> 01:41:05,615
Didn't you know anything? Next
month we are coming there!

877
01:41:05,701 --> 01:41:06,645
Didn't brother in law tell, anything?

878
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:08,976
Issac brother had
send us all the visas at all.

879
01:41:09,067 --> 01:41:11,104
Kariachan is learning
to drum for that only!

880
01:41:11,867 --> 01:41:15,110
I will just rock for all the
Malayalee programs in America...

881
01:41:15,167 --> 01:41:17,511
for church programs and all.

882
01:41:17,767 --> 01:41:20,247
Then, brother in law
will be shocked, is it not?

883
01:41:20,367 --> 01:41:21,266
Why not?

884
01:41:21,267 --> 01:41:23,543
What is the value of dollar now?

885
01:41:23,867 --> 01:41:27,007
It has been very long, since
we have seen Dollar!

886
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:32,675
I've never seen Dollar, do you
have one in hand, to show me!

887
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:37,508
This is our Sebastian!

888
01:41:40,201 --> 01:41:43,671
Don't you remember him?
He is your younger brother.

889
01:41:43,934 --> 01:41:47,438
He has given up old roughness,
now turned to a decent person.

890
01:41:47,501 --> 01:41:51,950
Dad had told me to use your car
and your room on reaching at States!

891
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:00,305
Are you studying from native
place, from now on, is it not?

892
01:42:00,601 --> 01:42:02,444
Brother in law Issac had told that.

893
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:06,107
Ask about the other thing.

894
01:42:06,234 --> 01:42:10,239
You ask.

895
01:42:10,334 --> 01:42:11,574
Hubby you ask.

896
01:42:12,667 --> 01:42:15,113
He is your brother's son.
Is it not? You must ask.

897
01:42:15,201 --> 01:42:22,449
Son, tell brother to send some
money along with the ticket.

898
01:42:58,367 --> 01:43:02,008
John's and Korah Murrikkan had
come to Allocious College

899
01:43:02,067 --> 01:43:05,207
by giving up the luxurious
life in America.

900
01:43:08,867 --> 01:43:11,279
They have disdained
properties worth of millions

901
01:43:11,367 --> 01:43:14,314
and have travelled
to seek their roots.

902
01:43:14,367 --> 01:43:16,870
And they are all the more
happy in this endeavor.

903
01:43:16,934 --> 01:43:19,141
They understand, when
a person comes to know

904
01:43:19,201 --> 01:43:20,271
the problems of ordinary men.

905
01:43:20,367 --> 01:43:23,109
They realize, to know
the real Indians.

906
01:43:25,134 --> 01:43:26,511
That is the reason why,

907
01:43:26,567 --> 01:43:28,012
these young men can enjoy stay
in single bedroomed house,

908
01:43:28,067 --> 01:43:32,038
walk on foot and
country cuisines.

909
01:43:33,167 --> 01:43:36,910
As youth's are speedily following
the fashion and luxurious life,

910
01:43:37,001 --> 01:43:39,880
these Mallu's who had come
from America are all the more

911
01:43:39,967 --> 01:43:40,968
different from the
present day youths.

912
01:43:41,067 --> 01:43:43,707
As the new generation are after
extravaganza, John's and Korah...

913
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:45,906
becomes unique
examples of simple life...

914
01:43:45,967 --> 01:43:48,140
by showing their life as a message.

915
01:43:50,967 --> 01:43:53,641
Hey are you staying here quietly?

916
01:43:53,834 --> 01:43:56,940
You guys are the role model for the
new generation, then how come

917
01:43:57,034 --> 01:43:58,513
you are shy and standing aloof?

918
01:43:59,201 --> 01:44:02,273
We Malayalli's have a
problem do you know what?

919
01:44:02,334 --> 01:44:04,678
Once we see something good,
very difficult to accept it.

920
01:44:04,767 --> 01:44:07,247
Hey give them a good clap!

921
01:44:23,367 --> 01:44:26,177
Now why should I take a
class on money management?

922
01:44:26,367 --> 01:44:29,314
These smart ones, have shown
with their life, haven't they?

923
01:45:00,034 --> 01:45:05,712
Sir, this Johns Issac and Keera
Murikkan, no Korah Murikkan...

924
01:45:05,801 --> 01:45:07,246
they are wanted by principal.

925
01:45:23,167 --> 01:45:27,946
Do you know what this is? Do
you know, who all will read this?

926
01:45:28,067 --> 01:45:32,948
This is for the first time, a thing like
this, have come about the students here.

927
01:45:37,567 --> 01:45:39,444
Got scared, is it not?

928
01:45:39,501 --> 01:45:44,246
Hey congratulations man!
Not only about the students.

929
01:45:44,301 --> 01:45:48,579
It is for the first time, a news
about the college is coming.

930
01:45:48,667 --> 01:45:53,047
In three places, it is specially
mentioned Allocious College.

931
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:58,476
Saw the youth page
is it not? How is it?

932
01:46:58,967 --> 01:47:00,776
Seena Mol really worked
as a thunder bolt is it not?

933
01:47:00,867 --> 01:47:03,711
Congrats lady! You are really mad!

934
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:07,942
Really! Then our
readers are also mad.

935
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,911
You don't underestimate readers.

936
01:47:10,001 --> 01:47:13,642
Hey get lost, right from the morning
the phone calls are pouring in...

937
01:47:13,734 --> 01:47:14,610
like anything before!

938
01:47:14,701 --> 01:47:15,975
Asking the numbers of that guys!

939
01:47:16,067 --> 01:47:18,013
Those boys have become a star!

940
01:47:18,101 --> 01:47:21,014
You have not cheated
the readers, but your self's!

941
01:47:21,134 --> 01:47:25,549
Look, only now I came to the
track, when I started my carrier,

942
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:27,876
I had sincerity and
social commitment also.

943
01:47:27,967 --> 01:47:32,040
Then what happened?
Now Seena Mol is a star.

944
01:47:32,101 --> 01:47:33,546
Did you become a journalist for that?

945
01:47:33,634 --> 01:47:36,945
Do you think that, all this
news coming in the newspaper...

946
01:47:37,034 --> 01:47:38,274
and channels are true?

947
01:47:38,967 --> 01:47:41,573
It is all created dear! Like this one!

948
01:47:42,667 --> 01:47:44,704
But this is really atrocious!

949
01:47:44,767 --> 01:47:49,807
Story must be sensational and the
circulation must go up, that is all dear!

950
01:47:50,867 --> 01:47:55,714
Are you coming to fashion show by
evening? There will be smart boys, girl!

951
01:48:01,367 --> 01:48:03,347
Both of you are happy now!

952
01:48:03,467 --> 01:48:04,912
There was not much
clarity for the photo.

953
01:48:05,034 --> 01:48:06,274
But mine was good one!

954
01:48:07,434 --> 01:48:11,814
Both the guys are fire
brands! Must meet Balettan,

955
01:48:13,234 --> 01:48:15,009
heard that went cross
with the boys of Akhilesh!

956
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:17,205
Where there is violence,
our party will be there...

957
01:48:17,301 --> 01:48:19,338
then for the poor and starved.

958
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:22,438
Hey man, where, your
party is there, there is violence!

959
01:48:22,534 --> 01:48:24,104
Rajesh, leave them alone!

960
01:48:24,167 --> 01:48:26,613
You don't get worried!
We are supporting them!

961
01:48:26,834 --> 01:48:29,371
Don't you know where the party
office is, on top of beverages?

962
01:48:29,467 --> 01:48:30,377
Okay then, see you!

963
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:38,411
Be careful, men
started to take attention.

964
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:44,000
<i>$11224.</i>

965
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,209
Is the aluminum
roofing of the house over?

966
01:48:52,267 --> 01:48:52,904
Over!

967
01:48:53,034 --> 01:48:54,104
Is the leaks done with?

968
01:48:54,168 --> 01:48:54,873
Finished!

969
01:48:54,967 --> 01:48:58,505
So all your things are going
smoothly, but from your newspaper,

970
01:48:58,567 --> 01:49:00,444
I'm not getting any benefit.

971
01:49:00,534 --> 01:49:02,411
Had not the report
of Kerala Yatra appeared,

972
01:49:02,467 --> 01:49:04,777
even though when I was on leave,
gave the news at the right time.

973
01:49:04,867 --> 01:49:09,543
I saw that but also saw the story of
two idiots by the side of our news.

974
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:13,446
That news about the NRI boys, is it
not? That is only to fill the columns.

975
01:49:13,634 --> 01:49:15,545
We have seen these kind
of madness, of the men

976
01:49:15,634 --> 01:49:16,908
who have money, long before.

977
01:49:17,034 --> 01:49:19,537
But anybody can understand,
in that, here and there...

978
01:49:19,601 --> 01:49:21,239
I'm the one, who is sly poked!

979
01:49:21,334 --> 01:49:24,076
Who had reported this?
A lady in the probation.

980
01:49:24,134 --> 01:49:26,136
Told to publish, as it was
a story with a positive note...

981
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:27,338
from the minister's college.

982
01:49:27,434 --> 01:49:28,936
Are you a bureau chief or...

983
01:49:29,634 --> 01:49:31,170
But in the youth page!

984
01:49:31,234 --> 01:49:32,577
Don't beat about the bush!

985
01:49:32,634 --> 01:49:35,547
There should not be any kind
of follow up, on this story!

986
01:49:35,634 --> 01:49:38,547
Why is that you told you will scribble
some positive story before the election?

987
01:49:38,667 --> 01:49:40,044
Roopesh is working on the plan.

988
01:49:40,467 --> 01:49:42,344
It must appear before the election.

989
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:50,979
Who is that? Mathew
sir got conned or what?

990
01:49:51,067 --> 01:49:53,673
That news about those two
American boys, on that news...

991
01:49:53,767 --> 01:49:55,678
it seems Akhilesh's Kerala
Yatra got duped up!

992
01:49:56,434 --> 01:49:59,506
Threatened, will assault, if one
does any kind of follow up on that.

993
01:49:59,567 --> 01:50:02,480
Then you don't take up that, our
channel will take up that story.

994
01:50:02,534 --> 01:50:04,036
<i>Man don": you have any other ï¬‚ab'.!</i>

995
01:50:04,101 --> 01:50:06,377
If it comes in any
channel I will be in trouble.

996
01:50:06,434 --> 01:50:09,608
I have decided to cover
that story, early morning itself,

997
01:50:09,667 --> 01:50:11,647
when I asked three days
leave, for my sister's marriage.

998
01:50:11,701 --> 01:50:13,977
I was told to come up
with some interesting story!

999
01:50:14,034 --> 01:50:15,069
Leave that man!

1000
01:50:15,134 --> 01:50:18,513
No, will spice up, with
damn good visuals and all.

1001
01:50:19,401 --> 01:50:22,871
Who had put clavier spade.
That was striked by queen.

1002
01:50:23,034 --> 01:50:26,811
Then in that case, let the
Jacky be on top of the queen!

1003
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,139
Everything, should be in
the mood of a live reporting.

1004
01:50:32,301 --> 01:50:35,942
Will enter after an intro, that is, in
the back ground there is house.

1005
01:50:37,234 --> 01:50:39,180
Not only back ground I
should be also in the frame.

1006
01:50:39,234 --> 01:50:41,771
Why don't we put the camera in a
low angle and charge and take like this!

1007
01:50:41,834 --> 01:50:43,279
Hey man don't make me mad!

1008
01:50:43,334 --> 01:50:47,476
At least today we must
have an exclusive, my buddy!

1009
01:50:53,834 --> 01:50:56,474
Living among us but
not like us, the two men,

1010
01:50:56,567 --> 01:50:59,047
who had become role
models for us, Johns and Korah.

1011
01:50:59,167 --> 01:51:02,239
Today in Youth and Talk we
have stunning life stories of them...

1012
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:03,711
who had stolen the hearts of youth.

1013
01:51:06,667 --> 01:51:08,647
Keep it on the table!
Slept or what?

1014
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:10,577
Got it man!

1015
01:51:10,634 --> 01:51:16,050
This is the cost cutting,
here the soap is cut and kept.

1016
01:51:17,167 --> 01:51:22,446
Paper napkin, this
must be the breakfast!

1017
01:51:23,334 --> 01:51:25,644
Sugar, to keep away from ants!

1018
01:51:26,534 --> 01:51:28,377
Hallo, who are you?

1019
01:51:28,667 --> 01:51:30,476
I'm Srikumar Perrunna!

1020
01:51:30,567 --> 01:51:31,204
What do you want?

1021
01:51:32,934 --> 01:51:34,777
Today, in this episode,
we are meeting,

1022
01:51:34,867 --> 01:51:36,141
who have come from America... two!

1023
01:51:42,334 --> 01:51:43,711
Beef is finished,
shall we order more?

1024
01:51:43,801 --> 01:51:44,939
No need.
Yes, order!

1025
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:49,841
Brother, beef fry
one more plate, repeat.

1026
01:51:50,367 --> 01:51:52,278
Who will notice when the news,
that comes in the local page...

1027
01:51:52,367 --> 01:51:56,577
in the paper, but your colour will be
completely changed when on TV.

1028
01:51:56,667 --> 01:51:58,943
That is the impact
when it comes in channel.

1029
01:51:59,067 --> 01:52:01,843
This will go to the very house
in America! Just wait and see.

1030
01:52:02,301 --> 01:52:05,805
Just be part and cooperate, then I
will manage to make it, to a big event.

1031
01:52:05,867 --> 01:52:10,577
Son this Mullaperiyar what is
happening on that, there was a time,

1032
01:52:10,667 --> 01:52:12,112
when we were all frightened,
it will break very now!

1033
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:15,113
Are you sad, on not breaking, you
should be happy on that is it not?

1034
01:52:15,167 --> 01:52:16,703
How much is it? We are together.

1035
01:52:17,334 --> 01:52:18,312
240!

1036
01:52:23,167 --> 01:52:25,238
Upholding the simple
life followed by Gandhiji,

1037
01:52:25,301 --> 01:52:28,180
these two young men,
who had come from America...

1038
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:30,777
Brother, is it necessary,
that this cooling glass?

1039
01:52:30,867 --> 01:52:32,369
My heavens! Must not
wear cooling glass!

1040
01:52:32,467 --> 01:52:33,343
Then shall I wear?

1041
01:52:33,434 --> 01:52:35,175
Not that, it may not
work out on our mood!

1042
01:52:37,034 --> 01:52:38,980
Shall we not add
some more flavors?

1043
01:52:39,067 --> 01:52:40,478
Yes, indeed!
Then carry on!

1044
01:52:45,967 --> 01:52:47,105
Camera is running okay!

1045
01:52:47,401 --> 01:52:49,881
How can you cut
short the living expense

1046
01:52:49,967 --> 01:52:52,208
when the living cost is shooting up?

1047
01:52:57,967 --> 01:53:01,566
According to Indian planning board,
for a person to survive for one day,

1048
01:53:01,567 --> 01:53:03,547
Rs. 28 is required, do
you agree with that?

1049
01:53:03,667 --> 01:53:07,308
What Rs. 28! With Rs. 83 can't live
her! Then how come with Rs.28!

1050
01:53:07,434 --> 01:53:10,677
Is your life, a protest
against our government?

1051
01:53:17,801 --> 01:53:20,247
These young men are inviting
attention to a big social

1052
01:53:20,334 --> 01:53:21,745
and political issue.

1053
01:53:22,167 --> 01:53:24,044
They are strongly protesting against
the ever increasing living cost,

1054
01:53:24,134 --> 01:53:30,176
making the poor, poorer, News
TV Channel is proud to bring new

will be followed in Youth and Talk.

1057
01:53:37,534 --> 01:53:38,512

"As others run, I will
run right at the middle."

1072

"Men have different desires."

1073
01:55:14,034 --> 01:55:15,843
"What is confronted is..."

1074

"What a big destiny of fate.
Do not succumb to fate."

1075
01:55:18,134 --> 01:55:20,944
"Carry on, must go no with
the gimmicks till the last."

1076
01:56:38,234 --> 01:56:41,807
Dad, what about the bike?

1077
01:56:42,267 --> 01:56:46,113
Here, the children of millionaires
are going to college by walking.

1078
01:56:46,167 --> 01:56:47,544
Get lost you and your bike!

1079

"As others run, I will run right at the

1095
01:58:04,901 --> 01:58:08,610
Today we have two special
guests, Johns and Korah,

1096
01:58:08,801 --> 01:58:12,749
they are also teaching us to
cut short the living expenses,

1097
01:58:12,834 --> 01:58:14,541
coming from America.

1098
01:58:14,667 --> 01:58:17,773
There is a caller on club
FM, let's see who this is.

1099
01:58:20,601 --> 01:58:21,909
Is it Johns and Korah?

1100
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:25,604
We are the final year, electronics
students of Aqueous College.

1101
01:58:26,267 --> 01:58:28,747
We have decided to cancel the
annual tour and with that money,

1102
01:58:28,867 --> 01:58:32,371
decided to build a house
for the poor family.

1103
01:58:37,434 --> 01:58:41,109
"Men have different desires.
What is confronted is..."

1104
01:58:41,201 --> 01:58:42,544
"What a big destiny of fate.
Do not succumb to fate."

1105
01:58:42,634 --> 01:58:46,241
"Carry on, must go no with
the gimmicks till the last."

1106
01:59:31,067 --> 01:59:32,068
Who are they?

1107
01:59:33,467 --> 01:59:36,311
Chief Minister is
saying we are naxal's.

1108
01:59:36,434 --> 01:59:40,439
22 families are in the protest tents,

1109
01:59:40,568 --> 01:59:42,013
just like the beggars for
so many months now.

1110
01:59:42,067 --> 01:59:44,138
No political parties still now
have taken any concern over it.

1111
01:59:44,634 --> 01:59:48,081
Only few college students and
church have come up for help.

1112
01:59:48,201 --> 01:59:52,047
Only surviving with
food from the rice they bring.

1113
01:59:52,101 --> 01:59:54,274
Dude our rice is also over!

1114
01:59:55,434 --> 01:59:57,107
But even if we come...

1115
01:59:57,167 --> 02:00:01,445
If you come, the students from
the college, will have more vigor.

1116
02:00:01,701 --> 02:00:06,241
As a result of that, the authorities
cannot avoid us, all of a sudden.

1117
02:00:06,767 --> 02:00:10,408
We have already committed
certain programs. Is it not Johns?

1118
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:12,777
There are lot of programs for
which dates are already given.

1119
02:00:13,001 --> 02:00:18,781
Will cancel all that, we will be
definitely be there for the protest.

1120
02:00:18,867 --> 02:00:21,780

Then shall we.
Okay then.

1123
02:00:28,201 --> 02:00:29,179
Okay children.

1124
02:00:35,334 --> 02:00:37,473
These guys, no cash
even, to cook the rice!

1125
02:00:37,567 --> 02:00:39,478
Tomorrow morning
program at the ladies college.

1126
02:00:39,534 --> 02:00:41,275
If we go for that, we will
get at least small snacks!

1127
02:00:41,568 --> 02:00:42,512
If we go for their program?

1128
02:00:42,567 --> 02:00:43,944
Who is going for the
protest and things?

1129
02:00:45,801 --> 02:00:48,441
Lucky, we die, eating a burger!

1130
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:50,138
When, will we, go...

1131
02:00:51,367 --> 02:00:53,608
This is our breakfast.

1132
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:57,574
Total five, out which three are sold,

1133
02:00:57,867 --> 02:01:00,643
this is some kind of poor,
Chinese quality metal!

1134
02:01:00,701 --> 02:01:02,305
After selling, shop
keepers may not take it back.

1135
02:01:05,267 --> 02:01:06,177
Only this much!

1136
02:01:06,701 --> 02:01:09,375

If I go, will get more money than this.

1141
02:01:21,268 --> 02:01:27,810
Will get, more than this, but not
for that, but for this, this trophy!

1142
02:01:27,967 --> 02:01:33,349
If you give this, I'll get you Rs.
1,000 for this, as simple as a flower!

1143

You are also on this competition,
try to get this trophy somehow!

1144
02:01:40,301 --> 02:01:43,441

more, you will see my true, nature!

1145
02:01:43,534 --> 02:01:45,844

This one lakh Rupees

1152
02:02:20,634 --> 02:02:25,500
Though, one lakh is not a big
amount, value of the award is really big!

1153
02:02:25,501 --> 02:02:27,947
No, no, one lakh is a

Who are they?

1163
02:02:46,567 --> 02:02:47,307
Abukka!

1164
02:02:47,734 --> 02:02:49,975
Will this price money be
received at the award function?

1165
02:02:50,567 --> 02:02:54,447
The result is not yet with,
you are in the third position.

1166
02:02:54,834 --> 02:02:57,144
First one is Finance
Minister Akkilesh Varma.

1167
02:02:57,434 --> 02:02:59,744
Second is, Kapila Das writer.

1168
02:03:00,367 --> 02:03:03,473
Must regard as a great achievement
that you are the finalist,

1169
02:03:04,401 --> 02:03:07,280
On the SMS vote
Akkilesh is far ahead.

1170
02:03:14,768 --> 02:03:17,044
Since, you had come in youth
award, there was a hype...

1171
02:03:17,101 --> 02:03:20,605
in SMS rating. Is it not Pottens?

1172
02:03:20,667 --> 02:03:21,577
Yes, indeed!

1173
02:03:21,634 --> 02:03:23,875
I was telling them Akkilesh
Varma, is the one leading.

1174
02:03:23,934 --> 02:03:28,644
No, no need of speculations. It is an
age of new media, one comment

1175
02:03:28,767 --> 02:03:32,237
or twit is enough to change
all this position within a day!

1176
02:03:32,334 --> 02:03:34,871
You still have time to
come to the front.

1177
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,812
The final result will be
based on the SMS vote, only.

1178
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,308
It must be like that.

1179
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:42,105
Yes, sir.

1180
02:03:47,267 --> 02:03:49,679
We must somehow get this award.

1181
02:03:49,900 --> 02:03:51,777
Can send some
messages from my phone

1182
02:03:51,934 --> 02:03:53,504
if your phone wouldn't
have smashed by you,

1183
02:03:53,601 --> 02:03:54,909
could have send some messages.

1184
02:03:55,567 --> 02:03:58,878
We can send messages by the
friends in college and by Lyoid.

1185
02:03:58,934 --> 02:04:00,004
That is not enough dude

1186
02:04:00,134 --> 02:04:02,671
That Akkilesh will pay the cash
and employ men to send the SMS.

1187
02:04:10,167 --> 02:04:12,044
Where are you now?
At the shooting?

1188
02:04:12,167 --> 02:04:13,237
No, at the college.

1189
02:04:13,334 --> 02:04:15,109
When Scaria called
from Kumbannadu,

1190
02:04:15,201 --> 02:04:16,612
it seems you are not
picking up the phone.

1191
02:04:16,734 --> 02:04:17,678
You are busy is it not?

1192
02:04:18,834 --> 02:04:23,715
Son this month attendance is
very poor! So, in that case,

1193
02:04:23,834 --> 02:04:25,541
will remit only Rs. 3,000
in the account.

1194
02:04:25,667 --> 02:04:28,477
If the things go on like
this, the next month...

1195
02:04:28,534 --> 02:04:29,706
Will not be required, Dad.

1196
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:36,650
Maximum one week, before
that I'll come to a decision.

1197
02:04:39,367 --> 02:04:41,904
Johns, son!

1198
02:04:49,301 --> 02:04:52,248
These men was are pushed to
streets in the name of development.

1199
02:04:52,301 --> 02:04:54,577
They have started to protest against
the government, for a long time,

1200
02:04:54,634 --> 02:04:56,545
who tries to vacate them.

1201
02:04:56,634 --> 02:04:59,410
This strike has got no backing
from any political parties,

1202
02:04:59,501 --> 02:05:02,812
students are backing this
strike and have gained attention.

1203
02:05:02,867 --> 02:05:05,939
Failing not to mention with the
involvement of Johns Korah in it.

1204
02:05:06,034 --> 02:05:09,038
They have made, life a protest by

1205
02:05:09,167 --> 02:05:10,737
which means are they
going to lead this protest?

1206
02:05:10,867 --> 02:05:12,278
We'll ask them.

1207
02:05:13,601 --> 02:05:16,775
For those who lost the house,
for those who were vacated,

1208
02:05:16,834 --> 02:05:20,805
their pain, we know that very well.

1209
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:24,640
Thrown out from houses, no food!

1210
02:05:29,967 --> 02:05:33,437
This protest has got a genuine
intention, do not divert that.

1211
02:05:33,767 --> 02:05:37,237
We students only supports this
protest, it is for them to speak,

1212
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:39,007
so ask them!

1213
02:05:39,334 --> 02:05:40,472
Both of you come here!

1214
02:05:41,767 --> 02:05:43,041
Why a show off here!

1215
02:05:43,101 --> 02:05:45,240
We came, to support the strike.

1216
02:05:48,067 --> 02:05:51,981
Will strike till, death.

1217
02:05:55,534 --> 02:05:57,445
Government, uphold justice!

1218
02:05:59,067 --> 02:06:01,707
Somehow must get that
one lakh rupees, with that SMS.

1219
02:06:01,801 --> 02:06:03,041
I told you, at that time, is it not?

1220
02:06:03,134 --> 02:06:03,942
When did you tell?

1221
02:06:26,834 --> 02:06:30,338
Will not spare this land!

1222
02:06:31,967 --> 02:06:33,742
Who had acknowledged
the collectors order?

1223
02:06:33,834 --> 02:06:34,642
It is me sir.

1224
02:06:34,900 --> 02:06:37,346
Are you planning to
stay in here, with that order?

1225
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:39,944
Before 10 o'clock all this
sheds will be demolished is that

1226
02:06:40,001 --> 02:06:41,480
what you told and singed on it.

1227
02:06:41,534 --> 02:06:43,810
We had signed, on the condition
that we will be replaced with

1228
02:06:43,867 --> 02:06:45,938
houses. If there is any decision
on that, tell that sir!

1229
02:06:46,034 --> 02:06:48,708
No, no, I do not know all those
things! You go and talk to collector.

1230
02:06:48,767 --> 02:06:50,303
Then where will we go, tell that.

1231
02:06:50,367 --> 02:06:51,971
That, and all I don't know.

1232
02:06:52,067 --> 02:06:52,841
Get up!

1233
02:06:55,034 --> 02:06:57,412
Get up and go man!

1234
02:06:59,767 --> 02:07:03,579
Will strike till, death!

1235
02:07:07,134 --> 02:07:10,980
Will not spare this land! And the
house, we are born, never leave that!

1236
02:07:11,067 --> 02:07:16,244
No problem sir, they will cooperate
sir! No chance of a protest sir.

1237
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,609
They are departing from the tents.

1238
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:20,846
Hey, no need of camping here sir.

1239
02:07:22,700 --> 02:07:23,440
What is this man!

1240
02:07:28,300 --> 02:07:31,076
What is this, get up and get lost!

1241
02:07:34,501 --> 02:07:36,276
Move back from the vehicle!

1242
02:07:37,501 --> 02:07:39,981
What is your problem get up
and go! Didn't I tell, to get up?

1243
02:07:46,567 --> 02:07:47,409
What did you say?

1244
02:07:47,467 --> 02:07:48,810
Move away from the
side of the vehicle!

1245
02:07:49,034 --> 02:07:54,848
Tell the verdict on their matters,
where will they go from here?

1246
02:07:54,934 --> 02:07:58,143
As the election is declared,
government cannot take a decision on it.

1247
02:07:58,267 --> 02:07:59,466
As soon as the
election is completed,

1248
02:07:59,467 --> 02:08:00,946
rehabilitation package
will be declared.

1249
02:08:01,068 --> 02:08:02,911
Only till that time, they
only have to cooperate.

1250
02:08:02,967 --> 02:08:04,105
Don't try to fool them by saying,

1251
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:07,204
adjust for the time
being and will decide later.

1252
02:08:07,301 --> 02:08:08,803
We have heard enough of it.

1253
02:08:12,101 --> 02:08:13,341
Tell the decision sir.

1254
02:08:13,934 --> 02:08:14,708
Tell sir.

1255
02:08:14,867 --> 02:08:16,244
You people can't
understand by saying is it not?

1256
02:08:16,301 --> 02:08:17,507
Lift them away!

1257
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:22,910
Leave me!

1258
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:34,400
<i>$11224.</i>

1259
02:10:50,367 --> 02:10:54,611
On taking part with strike, will
get SMS, got beating! Stopped!

1260
02:10:54,701 --> 02:10:58,171
For getting the award you die,
or kill do whatever you want!

1261
02:10:58,267 --> 02:11:00,338
You wait and see this
plan will be worked out.

1262
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:02,971
The channels came to
the hospital, took the interview,

1263
02:11:03,067 --> 02:11:04,546
only when we suffer,
will get the cash!

1264
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:07,308
This is the cash we are getting
for the first time by suffering.

1265
02:11:07,401 --> 02:11:09,938
On trying real hard, that one lakh
rupees will fall in to our hands!

1266
02:11:10,001 --> 02:11:11,639
With that we can go back.

1267
02:11:11,701 --> 02:11:14,011
You try all by yourself, I'm not there!

1268
02:11:14,067 --> 02:11:15,410
You go, if you get the cash.

1269
02:11:16,034 --> 02:11:19,504
When you reach there, if you
have the soul! Send one ticket,

1270
02:11:19,667 --> 02:11:21,738
I'll come if I'm alive!

1271
02:11:22,701 --> 02:11:24,476
Had the police
knocked on your head!

1272
02:11:28,467 --> 02:11:33,610
It must be the police,
I can't! Tell, I'm dead!

1273
02:11:53,634 --> 02:11:55,307
Police really assaulted is it not?

1274
02:12:00,067 --> 02:12:02,638
We thought, you are pseudo
revolutionaries, saying,

1275
02:12:02,700 --> 02:12:05,544
knows the pain of the
ones who are starved!

1276
02:12:05,901 --> 02:12:09,371
But today on the intervention of
yours, there was a mood of revolt,

1277
02:12:09,467 --> 02:12:10,468
right from its roots!

1278
02:12:11,901 --> 02:12:14,882
Yes, spark of fire has been lit,

1279
02:12:14,967 --> 02:12:19,109
tomorrow it will engulf it to
a big flame! We'll spread it!

1280
02:12:19,200 --> 02:12:21,646
Tomorrow at least two
battalion of police will be there,

1281
02:12:21,734 --> 02:12:22,974
there might be firing also.

1282
02:12:24,501 --> 02:12:27,971
Once police attacks, must fight
back! We are there with you!

1283
02:12:28,300 --> 02:12:29,779
Police will shoot!

1284
02:12:29,868 --> 02:12:30,573
Let them!

1285
02:12:32,967 --> 02:12:34,708
Keep this in case of an emergency!

1286
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:41,944
No need.

1287
02:12:42,668 --> 02:12:44,807
This guts, is the biggest weapon!

1288
02:12:44,967 --> 02:12:48,278
Tomorrow a historic
event is waiting for you!

1289
02:12:48,334 --> 02:12:50,109
The words of Mao
is going to be true.

1290
02:12:50,167 --> 02:12:52,566
Villages like Illampalli, on
account of its resistance

1291
02:12:52,567 --> 02:12:54,410
will shake the beaucracy!

1292
02:12:54,467 --> 02:12:57,243
The tents destroyed by the police
will sprout again there itself, tomorrow.

1293
02:12:59,167 --> 02:13:00,441
Comrades will see you tomorrow!

1294
02:13:22,834 --> 02:13:30,446
I must see them. Must
call them, back at the earliest.

1295
02:13:31,934 --> 02:13:36,383
Not getting them over the phone.
Scaria had gone in search of them.

1296
02:13:38,401 --> 02:13:42,008
I must see them,
didn't I tell, must call them back.

1297
02:13:44,934 --> 02:13:49,474
Wait there, you are the only person,

1298
02:13:49,534 --> 02:13:50,911
is this the way to
correct the children?

1299
02:13:50,967 --> 02:13:54,710
Apart from this what was the way in
front of us? Are they to stay here?

1300
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:56,777
Then what happened
on sending them there?

1301
02:14:02,401 --> 02:14:07,401
<i>$11224.</i>

1302
02:14:55,900 --> 02:14:56,844
Where was it?

1303
02:14:57,901 --> 02:14:58,572
Here!

1304
02:14:59,467 --> 02:15:01,071
For me it was here!

1305
02:15:25,034 --> 02:15:27,480
American Malayalli's Johns
and Korah are found missing

1306
02:15:27,534 --> 02:15:30,276
after the Illampalli lathi charge.

1307
02:15:30,334 --> 02:15:33,781
Their friend and neighbor,
Lyoid Fernandez had informed...

1308
02:15:33,834 --> 02:15:35,279
this to media.

1309
02:15:35,334 --> 02:15:37,211
We had a relationship, having
food, from the same plate,

1310
02:15:37,267 --> 02:15:39,304
using one, and common toilet!

1311
02:15:40,501 --> 02:15:44,449
Buddy on seeing the scenes of their
beating on TV, heart was broken!

1312
02:15:44,601 --> 02:15:50,950
I went to station to give a
petition but I was questioned,

1313
02:15:51,067 --> 02:15:53,946
I'm the one who is answerable.

1314
02:15:54,001 --> 02:15:56,641
Children's parents will ask me!

1315
02:15:56,734 --> 02:15:59,578
Though the time has lapsed, on the
missing of Johns Korah, still now,

1316
02:15:59,634 --> 02:16:02,080
we do not have a concrete
answer on where they are.

1317
02:16:02,167 --> 02:16:04,306
From the circumstantial evidences
we can come to know that...

1318
02:16:04,367 --> 02:16:07,871
it is a well-planned kidnapping.

1319
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:11,709
There is a wide spread doubt that,
is police behind this missing?

1320
02:16:11,767 --> 02:16:14,008
Or is it any kind of sabotage?

1321
02:16:14,067 --> 02:16:18,413
Johns Korah's are they still alive?
Doubts are not ending, so as the news.

1322
02:16:25,034 --> 02:16:28,880
Even though, there was an attack
on police, no one was arrested

1323
02:16:28,967 --> 02:16:30,241
not even the leaders of the strike
nor the volunteers in the protest.

1324
02:16:30,334 --> 02:16:32,610
Then why should Johns and
Korah alone be arrested?

1325
02:16:39,067 --> 02:16:42,173
The DGP Varghese Manjuran
had stated that, American malayalli's...

1326
02:16:42,267 --> 02:16:44,645
and social activist, Johns Issac,
Korah Murrekkan's missing case...

1327
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:47,977
further more investigations
has been stated.

1328
02:16:52,934 --> 02:16:56,313
Our only prayers are, both
of them must be returned alive.

1329
02:16:56,667 --> 02:16:58,874
What is this government doing?

1330
02:17:41,101 --> 02:17:44,241
Students protest, claiming that the
government is behind their missing,

1331
02:17:44,301 --> 02:17:47,248
protest tuned out to violence.

1332
02:17:51,968 --> 02:17:56,110
Fascist and ruling terrorist's
creates, generally, martyrs.

1333
02:17:56,367 --> 02:17:59,211
What happened in the case of
comrade Johns and Korh is

1334
02:17:59,267 --> 02:18:00,302
nothing different.

1335
02:18:00,367 --> 02:18:02,108
This government must resign!

1336
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:06,639
People have asked in return
before, for the blood of martyrs.

1337
02:18:06,734 --> 02:18:08,839
With a weapon 'vote' !

1338
02:18:08,934 --> 02:18:13,041
Where is this, Johns and Korh,
government must answer'?

1339
02:18:23,968 --> 02:18:27,040
Have Johns and Korh been
murdered by political rivals?

1340
02:18:27,100 --> 02:18:29,512
Or will we hear the both names,
in the list of ones in the lockups,

1341
02:18:29,567 --> 02:18:31,205
in the coming days?

1342
02:18:31,734 --> 02:18:34,237
Will this be a headache for
the government as there are only

1343
02:18:34,334 --> 02:18:36,041
few days left for the election?

1344
02:18:47,134 --> 02:18:49,375
Must smile properly.

1345
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:53,905
Mother, greetings, should help.

1346
02:18:54,167 --> 02:18:58,411
Help, you all threw
away that children!

1347
02:18:58,901 --> 02:19:01,472
Then coming here and standing.

1348
02:19:01,567 --> 02:19:02,944
Whose matter are
you telling Mother?

1349
02:19:03,901 --> 02:19:05,380
He is the candidate here.

1350
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:07,241
Akkilesh Varma, do
you know the symbol?

1351
02:19:07,301 --> 02:19:07,870
Why not?

1352
02:19:07,967 --> 02:19:08,877
We know everything,

1353
02:19:08,967 --> 02:19:13,712
Those children who disdained their
families for us, you all finished them!

1354
02:19:13,801 --> 02:19:19,752
Now, wants help! Get lost from
here, no one should be seen here.

1355
02:19:22,067 --> 02:19:24,946
Hi, sister!
Closed!

1356
02:19:27,101 --> 02:19:31,106
Akkilesh Varma,
candidate, our varma sir's son.

1357
02:19:31,201 --> 02:19:32,646
What is this all about?

1358
02:19:33,567 --> 02:19:35,843
These fellows have switched off
the mobile and will be enjoying

1359
02:19:35,934 --> 02:19:37,936
the chill in Kuttalam or kuttikanam.

1360
02:19:38,167 --> 02:19:40,340
How many more days
left for election, Venella?

1361
02:19:40,768 --> 02:19:44,841
Trying for the maximum, some
decision will be taken within 48 hours.

1362
02:19:44,934 --> 02:19:49,474
48 hours! Tomorrow morning at 11
is the press meet, what will I say?

1363
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:50,203
Let me...

1364
02:19:52,767 --> 02:19:54,303
You are very much late.

1365
02:19:55,134 --> 02:19:58,274
Things won't comply on
kissing the hand of bishop!

1366
02:19:58,333 --> 02:19:59,539
CM, don't feel bad,

1367
02:19:59,633 --> 02:20:02,239
police lathi charge at Illiampalli,
worsened the situation to such an extent.

1368
02:20:02,334 --> 02:20:04,439
Oh! Now after everything,

1369
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:06,480
planning to put the blame on
home ministry and police, is it?

1370
02:20:06,767 --> 02:20:09,475
How long, is this student's missing?

1371
02:20:09,567 --> 02:20:11,740
What are you coming to say?

1372
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:15,243
Are these police here, standing
with the finger in the mouth!

1373
02:20:15,467 --> 02:20:18,346
Anyway, due to their missing it
has created worry for me also.

1374
02:20:18,400 --> 02:20:21,006
Look, it is your responsibility
also, to find them.

1375
02:20:21,100 --> 02:20:23,603
Those, children are studying in
the benami, College of yours.

1376
02:20:24,134 --> 02:20:26,671
Things will fall in its place
only when we stand together.

1377
02:20:26,734 --> 02:20:30,113
You must do yours and I must do
mine, then only we can sit in the

1378
02:20:30,167 --> 02:20:32,272
ministerial chair like
this with buttocks!

1379
02:20:32,334 --> 02:20:33,506
Stop it Venella!

1380
02:20:33,967 --> 02:20:37,312
No body get tensed,
I'll manage my concerns.

1381
02:20:37,901 --> 02:20:40,177
<i>I will</i> do any help to find them.

1382
02:20:40,267 --> 02:20:41,302
No need sir.

1383
02:20:41,367 --> 02:20:46,339
Now, it is my need to find them and
win the elections. No body take trouble!

1384
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:59,850
Check this out! How is this lad?
He is a doctor in America.

1385
02:21:01,667 --> 02:21:03,237
Looks like those smug!

1386
02:21:03,367 --> 02:21:06,974
Who comes to marry film stars,
the one without moustache?

1387
02:21:07,100 --> 02:21:08,875
This is like that type. I don't want.

1388
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:12,447
Then are you going to
study for Mother Theresa?

1389
02:21:12,667 --> 02:21:15,910
Professor you don't take trouble,
I'll find out my bridegroom.

1390
02:21:17,767 --> 02:21:19,110
Go and open the door!

1391
02:21:22,934 --> 02:21:27,280
Hey where were you?
Where are you coming from?

1392
02:21:27,767 --> 02:21:29,713
Madhu Mitha.

1393
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,946
Happy to know that you are alive!

1394
02:21:40,234 --> 02:21:42,942
Two cops have come
here in search of you.

1395
02:21:43,067 --> 02:21:44,910
Madhu Mitha we actually...

1396
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:48,038
If confession is your intention,
go straight and turn left.

1397
02:21:48,100 --> 02:21:51,377
Church is there, I don't want
to listen.You must listen.

1398
02:21:51,467 --> 02:21:52,070
I don't want to hear.

1399
02:21:52,134 --> 02:21:55,377
Not that, for the last two
days we were in a junk bus.

1400
02:21:57,833 --> 02:21:59,312
Give something to eat.

1401
02:21:59,367 --> 02:22:00,311
Me too!

1402
02:22:00,400 --> 02:22:01,708
Suffer by yourself!

1403
02:22:02,767 --> 02:22:04,303
Go to that hospital and take a look,

1404
02:22:04,434 --> 02:22:05,811
just because of you, there
are few indigents.

1405
02:22:05,933 --> 02:22:07,537
Who got thrashing
and are lying there.

1406
02:22:07,901 --> 02:22:09,938
What harm did they do to you all!

1407
02:22:10,034 --> 02:22:11,843
Madhu Mitha listen to
what we are saying.

1408
02:22:12,434 --> 02:22:14,641
Don't let me to say, go out!

1409
02:22:47,967 --> 02:22:51,766
Right in the front page, Johns Korh
missing must be investigated by

1410
02:22:51,767 --> 02:22:56,045
police, comments
Justice Krishnna Raj.

1411
02:22:57,667 --> 02:23:02,810
What is your plan, shouldn't
inform home? Call home!

1412
02:23:08,467 --> 02:23:10,105
Do you have double bulls eye?

1413
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:12,808
Single.

1414
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:18,211
Then two dosa's will do.

1415
02:23:27,701 --> 02:23:30,307
Child! Prepare for them,
whatever they need.

1416
02:23:31,633 --> 02:23:34,045
Grand Father have you believed
the American story told by them?

1417
02:23:34,134 --> 02:23:35,169
Good!

1418
02:23:35,834 --> 02:23:38,110
Whatever that was told
yesterday is true.

1419
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:39,770
Then how are the things
to be, ongoing back?

1420
02:23:39,833 --> 02:23:41,107
Planning to be decent?

1421
02:23:44,967 --> 02:23:45,672
Yes.

1422
02:23:46,434 --> 02:23:50,382
How can they go back? Who
will give money for the ticket?

1423
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:58,710
Madhu Mitha, only you can help
us now. Will return the cash,

1424
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:00,541
once we reach there.

1425
02:24:00,634 --> 02:24:02,272
I don't have interest in that?

1426
02:24:04,100 --> 02:24:06,273
I don't have cash with
me, then how can I?

1427
02:24:07,067 --> 02:24:16,249
You have lot of ear rings,
on selling two or three!

1428
02:24:16,801 --> 02:24:17,802
Is it not gold?

1429
02:24:32,267 --> 02:24:33,439
Don't turn on the lights.

1430
02:24:33,567 --> 02:24:34,910
Will anyone see?

1431
02:24:34,967 --> 02:24:35,843
Keep quite you!

1432
02:24:37,867 --> 02:24:40,266
Korh please, don't make noise.

1433
02:24:40,267 --> 02:24:41,439
Not me it is the door.

1434
02:25:02,734 --> 02:25:05,180
See, these unwashed under
garments! That is Korh,

1435
02:25:05,267 --> 02:25:07,873
what I said, will wash
only once I reach there!

1436
02:25:10,167 --> 02:25:12,704
Washing and all, afterwards, must
send the cash of this ticket to

1437
02:25:12,833 --> 02:25:14,574
Madhu Mitha on reaching there.

1438
02:25:19,334 --> 02:25:20,836
Both together!

1439
02:25:22,734 --> 02:25:24,645
Why are you, not
putting on the light?

1440
02:25:25,367 --> 02:25:27,313
Current bill!

1441
02:25:31,034 --> 02:25:32,741
Where were you, both of you?

1442
02:25:33,367 --> 02:25:35,313
We were here itself!

1443
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:37,971
Media and people really
fried the government!

1444
02:25:38,301 --> 02:25:42,579
You are missing, in
the custody, killed.

1445
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:46,975
Arrange the press
meet tomorrow morning.

1446
02:25:47,201 --> 02:25:51,047
Me and missing Jonhs and Korh!

1447
02:25:56,900 --> 02:25:59,972
They will be with me. The rest of
the things, on meeting in person.

1448
02:26:02,434 --> 02:26:05,938
You don't worry anything,
just tell what I tell you to say.

1449
02:26:06,167 --> 02:26:07,840
Somebody have kidnapped you,

1450
02:26:07,967 --> 02:26:11,744
I will tell who did, what
was the motive and all.

1451
02:26:11,867 --> 02:26:13,312
Then, tomorrow.

1452
02:26:13,367 --> 02:26:14,437
We are not here, tomorrow.

1453
02:26:14,734 --> 02:26:15,439
Not here!

1454
02:26:15,567 --> 02:26:16,409
Tomorrow, we are not here.

1455
02:26:33,234 --> 02:26:35,578
Flight is at morning
5:30 we are going.

1456
02:26:35,767 --> 02:26:40,739
Going where to? Do you know what
all problems you have created?

1457
02:26:40,834 --> 02:26:43,280
Without solving all that
cannot go from here.

1458
02:26:47,367 --> 02:26:48,607
Tomorrow press meet,

1459
02:26:48,667 --> 02:26:50,613
after that along with me, for
the election campaigning.

1460
02:26:51,333 --> 02:26:52,710
Going back, will decide later.

1461
02:27:06,067 --> 02:27:08,013
Is this your problem?

1462
02:27:12,500 --> 02:27:14,411
I'll decide when you guys go!

1463
02:27:37,067 --> 02:27:38,205
Navas!

1464
02:27:38,333 --> 02:27:40,176
Not that way, come fast!

1465
02:27:42,300 --> 02:27:43,438
Catch them!

1466
02:27:43,734 --> 02:27:50,879
Don't leave, catch them! Stop there!

1467
02:27:52,201 --> 02:27:57,201
<i>$11224.</i>

1468
02:29:02,900 --> 02:29:04,243
Want water to drink.

1469
02:29:22,433 --> 02:29:23,605
Do you know this person?

1470
02:29:26,501 --> 02:29:28,845
Yea, he is the one at the house.

1471
02:29:29,267 --> 02:29:30,371
House?

1472
02:29:30,467 --> 02:29:32,003
No. Not this man.

1473
02:29:33,067 --> 02:29:34,944
Then do you know them?

1474
02:29:36,767 --> 02:29:37,507
No.

1475
02:29:37,567 --> 02:29:40,912
Just take a look and say. May
be your own Fathers photo!

1476
02:29:44,600 --> 02:29:50,710
You do not know them? Then
you might be knowing him?

1477
02:29:51,567 --> 02:29:52,375
Yes.

1478
02:29:55,167 --> 02:29:56,544
We know, we do not know them!

1479
02:29:56,600 --> 02:29:57,840
Gopan Chandrashekkar

1480
02:29:58,267 --> 02:30:02,613
one of the most wanted
extremist of central government.

1481
02:30:03,467 --> 02:30:05,913
Not only him, but you
know, all of them.

1482
02:30:05,967 --> 02:30:06,445
No.

1483
02:30:06,534 --> 02:30:08,207
Last week they had met you.

1484
02:30:08,267 --> 02:30:08,677
No.

1485
02:30:08,767 --> 02:30:10,007
19th night.

1486
02:30:10,067 --> 02:30:10,704
No.

1487
02:30:10,767 --> 02:30:12,474
That meeting took
place in your house.

1488
02:30:12,534 --> 02:30:13,444
No sir.

1489
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:17,670
There is an intelligence report that
you had planned a mission based

1490
02:30:17,767 --> 02:30:18,711
on Cochin Metro.

1491
02:30:18,800 --> 02:30:19,676
What was that plan?

1492
02:30:20,867 --> 02:30:22,471
It is true that they had come.

1493
02:30:24,767 --> 02:30:26,974
They came asking for
the support for the protest.

1494
02:30:28,001 --> 02:30:30,447
Told something absurd
and they had gone.

1495
02:30:30,633 --> 02:30:33,614
We do not know, their
ware bouts even now or then.

1496
02:30:33,667 --> 02:30:35,943
We are not connected
with any radical groups.

1497
02:30:37,234 --> 02:30:43,241
Whose is the master plan that you
are enacting here? Tell that also.

1498
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:55,040
Turn off that camera,
erase that last question.

1499
02:31:03,067 --> 02:31:05,343
I know you do not have
any connection with the

1500
02:31:05,400 --> 02:31:07,175
so called radical groups.

1501
02:31:07,367 --> 02:31:10,940
That is what we are
also saying. Leave us free!

1502
02:31:11,067 --> 02:31:16,141
What was that bothering you, on
telling to stay with Akkilesh till election?

1503
02:31:16,767 --> 02:31:21,614
What? Do you think you call break
Finance Minister's balls and go?

1504
02:31:21,734 --> 02:31:23,042
We can't do that!

1505
02:31:26,234 --> 02:31:29,511
Here in Fort Kochi, we have caught
the whites for buying the ganja,

1506
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:31,978
jailed them. And have made
them read...lndian law!

1507
02:31:32,300 --> 02:31:34,644
Now they are all in
jail making Chapatis!

1508
02:31:35,767 --> 02:31:38,748
No one have come
to ask nor will ask.

1509
02:32:14,934 --> 02:32:18,313
Sign, sign man!

1510
02:32:28,967 --> 02:32:30,344
Hey get UP!

1511
02:32:46,100 --> 02:32:47,272
Get inside!

1512
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:17,677
Slowly, stitch will break!

1513
02:33:19,501 --> 02:33:23,449
Urine is not passing is it not? Are
you discharged, or came out?

1514
02:33:23,567 --> 02:33:25,740
Where are they taken?
Tell me at least.

1515
02:33:25,800 --> 02:33:29,407
The problem cannot be solved by
putting those American boys in the jail.

1516
02:33:29,467 --> 02:33:32,141
Where are they taken
what is the plan?

1517
02:33:32,334 --> 02:33:33,608
Can go, only after telling that

1518
02:33:35,433 --> 02:33:36,707
Move back boy!

1519
02:33:36,834 --> 02:33:38,142
Are you blocking?

1520
02:33:38,667 --> 02:33:40,772
What you did is a big blunder?

1521
02:33:40,867 --> 02:33:43,211
When they are jailed,
there glamour will increase

1522
02:33:43,267 --> 02:33:44,541
They will grow from there.

1523
02:33:44,600 --> 02:33:46,705
After they are freed from jail, will
create head ache for us again.

1524
02:33:46,767 --> 02:33:47,302
A big trouble.

1525
02:33:47,434 --> 02:33:48,708
Then what are you going to do?

1526
02:33:50,434 --> 02:33:54,041
These things should not be delayed,
must be finished in a single shot!

1527
02:33:55,334 --> 02:34:00,943
How long I'm doing this! No
one has come to know that,

1528
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:04,345
. bladder was smashed
by those children!

1529
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:06,937
No one should know, it
is a shame, go and take rest.

1530
02:34:07,067 --> 02:34:08,137
Sir, they are waiting.

1531
02:34:08,267 --> 02:34:09,041
Coming man!

1532
02:34:13,734 --> 02:34:17,204
Live telecast of Home minister
Venella Gopalan Nair's press meet.

1533
02:34:17,300 --> 02:34:18,836
After government,
been put on turmoil.

1534
02:34:18,900 --> 02:34:20,243
The government's
official explanations,

1535
02:34:20,334 --> 02:34:22,007
after the missing of Johns and Korh.

1536
02:34:28,733 --> 02:34:30,144
Where is John's and Korh?

1537
02:34:30,234 --> 02:34:31,645
What is the crime they have done?

1538
02:34:32,067 --> 02:34:33,944
Why is the government
playing a hide and seek?

1539
02:34:34,067 --> 02:34:35,637
What the opposition
leader has told...

1540
02:34:36,867 --> 02:34:40,337
This is the foreigners act as per
1946, it is very well written in this.

1541
02:34:40,867 --> 02:34:46,647
Laws that have to be followed by
foreigners, on reaching here, in India.

1542
02:34:51,034 --> 02:34:55,779
This is the amendment
brought in 64. It is further strict...

1543
02:34:55,867 --> 02:34:57,676
What we have to ask is
what is the of fence done by them?

1544
02:34:58,134 --> 02:35:01,513
Be patient! Listen what I'm saying.

1545
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:02,977
After that, can do
cross questioning?

1546
02:35:03,100 --> 02:35:05,580
Is it a big crime in interfering
with the problems of the poor?

1547
02:35:05,667 --> 02:35:07,271
It is a crime, were bail,
will not be obtained.

1548
02:35:25,001 --> 02:35:27,538
In politics, missionary activities,
like that, there are lot of visa rules.

1549
02:35:27,633 --> 02:35:32,514
Areas where foreigners
cannot intervene.

1550
02:35:34,500 --> 02:35:37,845
...It is not what I have
told it is in this.

1551
02:35:42,600 --> 02:35:43,442
Sit.

1552
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:46,738
Sit there, keep quite!

1553
02:35:56,667 --> 02:35:59,079
Those who come in tourist
visa must see the place and go.

1554
02:35:59,167 --> 02:36:01,238
Those in student's visa
must study and go.

1555
02:36:01,900 --> 02:36:05,973
If they start to align with Maoist
and start doing national threats.

1556
02:36:06,033 --> 02:36:08,206
This government cannot
watch that and stand.

1557
02:36:13,267 --> 02:36:14,940
Johns and Korah
are they not Indians?

1558
02:36:15,067 --> 02:36:17,707
No they are not Indians.

1559
02:36:20,834 --> 02:36:24,077
They are the American
citizens born in America.

1560
02:36:31,400 --> 02:36:33,209
This is a political conspiracy.

1561
02:36:33,300 --> 02:36:35,075
This is to curb young men
entering politics, a clear cut,

1562
02:36:35,167 --> 02:36:37,340
"fabricated, political
programming, is it not?

1563
02:36:37,400 --> 02:36:40,279
No, government has got clear
evidences, video tapes,

1564
02:36:40,334 --> 02:36:43,144
where they are accepting the crime.

1565
02:36:48,201 --> 02:36:50,181
When are they going to be
produced in the court?

1566
02:36:50,267 --> 02:36:52,713
Government has taken the legal
opinion of Advocate General,

1567
02:36:52,801 --> 02:36:54,803
necessary actions have been taken.

1568
02:37:01,933 --> 02:37:03,935
So government had
decided to put them in jail is it?

1569
02:37:04,033 --> 02:37:08,743
Kerala government is
deporting them. Listen carefully.

1570
02:37:26,501 --> 02:37:31,575
Their visa, will be cancelled and
they will be send back home.

1571
02:37:50,200 --> 02:37:51,008
Come, get I-l P!

1572
02:37:51,167 --> 02:37:52,646
Get up!

1573
02:37:56,667 --> 02:37:58,544
This is truly in humane.
A violation of human rights.

1574
02:37:58,667 --> 02:38:02,080
A responsible government
must enact the rules.

1575
02:38:02,167 --> 02:38:04,010
Governments had deported
many in the past, of those

1576
02:38:04,067 --> 02:38:06,604
who fail to abide with the visa rules.

1577
02:38:14,534 --> 02:38:16,844
In this case, pertaining to
the fact, they are students

1578
02:38:16,901 --> 02:38:20,644
and also their mass support.
Giving, concessions.

1579
02:38:20,701 --> 02:38:23,147
Government has taken this decision
on the humanitarian ground.

1580
02:38:23,567 --> 02:38:25,866
Kerala government is
bearing all the expenses,

1581
02:38:25,867 --> 02:38:28,347
including the flight
ticket, for the return.

1582
02:38:28,467 --> 02:38:31,710
Government had contacted
American consulate, Embassy,

1583
02:38:31,801 --> 02:38:34,077
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and all.

1584
02:38:34,167 --> 02:38:37,114
Not only that, their
parents are also inform ed.

what would you like
to say to compatriots?

1588
02:39:23,834 --> 02:39:24,471
What did you ask?

1589
02:39:24,534 --> 02:39:26,536
How would you
react to the act of deporting?

1590
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:28,308
Shouldn't have done this, to us!

1591
02:39:28,400 --> 02:39:31,266
Youth have already reacted
to the governments, action.

1592
02:39:31,267 --> 02:39:32,337
What do you have to say to youths?

1593
02:39:32,434 --> 02:39:35,142
Future is always in the
hands of youth! Support them!

1594
02:39:37,367 --> 02:39:38,641
We have proved that!

1595
02:39:40,734 --> 02:39:43,146
Older generation must trust them!

1596
02:39:43,434 --> 02:39:44,572
Any message before you go?

1597
02:39:44,667 --> 02:39:45,236
What?

1598
02:39:45,733 --> 02:39:47,303
Any message to the people of India?

1599
02:39:55,600 --> 02:39:58,638
We have shown a way here, it is
dedicated to the young generation here!

1600

this year's Asia Today, Youth
Icon Award, has been declared.

1604

Korh are the Youth Icons of this

1605
02:40:44,267 --> 02:40:48,147

This award is for creating a change,
among the youths of Kerala,

1607
02:40:52,267 --> 02:40:57,182
by cut shorting the expenses,
disdaining luxurious life style in America.

1608
02:40:57,634 --> 02:41:02,674
They were elected by the Malayalee
youths, all over the world, through SMS.

1609
02:41:03,234 --> 02:41:05,771
As Johns and Korh
are bestowed with this award...

1610
02:41:05,867 --> 02:41:09,747
it has opened, an archetype,
on new way of living.

1611
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,708
Johns and Korh have returned
back, to where they have started.

1612
02:41:23,900 --> 02:41:26,176
Even though, they could not
make it, as Issac John expected!

1613
02:41:26,334 --> 02:41:29,076
They are coming back with a
master's degree that too,

1614
02:41:29,134 --> 02:41:32,809
from the biggest University, from
the world named, Keralam!

1615
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:36,980
Whatever may be the
intentions of Johns and Kora.

1616
02:41:37,133 --> 02:41:39,135
Though they played
'fiddle' without knowing!

1617
02:41:39,201 --> 02:41:41,238
Government, out of their despair,
had to build houses for the natives

1618
02:41:41,301 --> 02:41:46,216
of Illampilli. They got
back, their old lives.

1619
02:41:46,567 --> 02:41:48,547
Along with happiness.

1620
02:41:49,767 --> 02:41:53,305
In the bi election, during that
time, though failed tragically!

1621
02:41:53,400 --> 02:41:58,008
Akkilesh Varma is still a minister,
not in Kerala, but in the center!

1622
02:41:58,200 --> 02:42:02,444
He was elected to the Raja Saha,
as a nominee of the ruling party.

1623
02:42:02,534 --> 02:42:04,480
He is actively involved in
reconstruction of the country,

1624
02:42:04,534 --> 02:42:06,241
as the assistant minister of energy.

1625
02:42:06,434 --> 02:42:11,076
Why because, isn't India
a democratic country!

1626
02:42:14,967 --> 02:42:17,709
Johns had kept his word, as
soon as he reached America!

1627
02:42:17,934 --> 02:42:21,677
He had send the entire money
spend on ticket to Madhu Mitha!

1628
02:42:22,201 --> 02:42:26,650
Along with that, he had exchanged
one more thing. His heart.

1629
02:42:26,767 --> 02:42:28,178
She had accepted it!

1630
02:42:29,401 --> 02:42:31,347
As, all this is required for the story,

1631
02:42:31,434 --> 02:42:34,347
as Madhu Mitha has
got lot of other jobs to do.

1632
02:42:35,401 --> 02:42:39,247
Nothing of this sort ever happened!
She had lot of things to do, again!

1633
02:42:41,700 --> 02:42:45,079
Media birds have
forgotten Johns and Korh.

1634

They are waiting for
some other news avatar!
