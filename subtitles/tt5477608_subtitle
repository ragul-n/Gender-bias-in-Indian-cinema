2
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,700
Good or bad I've had the
habit of writing everything.

3
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,440
Today after 8 years,
I felt like writing again...

4
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,010
Slowly things are
beginning to get better.

5
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,480
Especially Mini...

6
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,000
Hopefully next Week, I will
he able to take Mini to America.

7
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,490
- Goodnight Mamma.
- Goodnight.

8
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,470
The Dock... keeps warning
me that I am wasting my money.

9
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,770
There is no guarantee that Mini
will walk again after the operation.

10
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,210
But... What is life without hope?

11
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,640
Today I gave the muse a day off..

12
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,220
Mini and I spent the
Whole Sunday messing about.

13
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,520
We cooked..

14
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,190
Cleaned the house..

15
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,020
I didn't do much Mini
did most of the work.

16
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,390
And in the night we had the
mother daughter ludo championship.

17
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,400
As usual Mini was Winning...
But how could I let that happen

18
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,200
I know she saw me cheat.

19
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,510
But she let me Win.

20
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,410
Nobody loves me like Mini does.

21
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,250
No...no...Mamma... Mamma...

22
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,120
Mini! Mini...Mini

23
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,760
Shhh. Darling.. It's okay..

24
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,190
It's just a had dream.

25
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,270
Nothing will happen
to you as long as I'm alive.

26
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,620
Mini .. Mini ..

00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,070

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,750

The number you are trying to reach...

00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,750
I can't get through to her mobile.
Maybe she is on the train.

41
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,010

have been here at 6. I am so late.

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,060
- In the toilet.
- Why were you late?

76
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,070
You must come at 6 a.m sharp!

77
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,400
Yes.. Sorry.

78
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,100
What happened to your voice?

79
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,670
I have a sole throat.

80
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,500
Make sure Mini does her school work.

81
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,170
And don't go too near to
I don't want her to get any infection.

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,470

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,810

00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,620
You are an unique sample!

86
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,560
Hello Doctor?

87
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,000
Vidya, when are you treating
me to some good sweets?

88
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,300
What's that famous
sweet of Chandan Nagar?

89
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,030
..JOLBHORA..?

90
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Whenever you say, Doctor.

91
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,330
Now?

92
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,670
I have a good news.

93
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,140
What news Doctor?

94
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,080
Mimi's confirmation has
come through with Dr. Andrews.

95
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,280
You can take her to America.

96
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,310
But I hope you realise..

97
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,350
There is no guarantee
that Mini will get better.

98
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,130
You still want to go?

99
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,190
Bidya?

100
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,400
Yes. I want to go.

101
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,170
That's the spirit.

102
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,270
Listen, my travel agent has done your
passports & visa and left them with me.

103
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,030
Come quickly and take them.

104
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:49,480
But remember. I am not giving
them unless you get me some sweets..

105
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,740
- Okay?
- Yes Doctor.

106
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,740
Bye.

107
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,600
Mini?

108
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,660
Mini?

109
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,990
Why are the lights off!

110
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,300
Mini?

111
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,590
Hello...

112
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,530
Where are you both?

113
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,400
I am in my house.

114
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,760
What? Where is Mini?

115
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,170
And Why are you in your house?

116
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,170
You told me not to come.

117
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,540
I spoke to you from my office.
You said..

118
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,170
What do you mean ..I told you..?

119
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,040
I was on my Way to your house.
You called and said not to come..

120
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,340
I called you?

121
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,350
Yes.

122
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,320
Uncle. .

123
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,360
- Uncle..

124
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,230

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,430
- Huh?

126
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,490
Yes. I Went in the morning.
Checked on her.

127
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,230
Gave her some juice.

128
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,140
- Then?
- You told me the muse has come.

129
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,040
I told you?

130
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,470
- Yes, you called and told me..
- When?

131
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,280

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,050
Around eleven?

133
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,620
But I never called you.

134
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,520
My phone's ringing--

00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,180
Who?

149
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,580
Indrojeet Singh.

150
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,550
Doctor Maity?

151
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,280
Sub-inspector Inderjeet Singh.

152
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,550
You reported a hit and run?

153
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,680
Yes, yes..But only hit not run.

154
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,560
He bought her in.

155
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,460
I swear, sir.. I did not hit her.

156
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,120
- She just Ian in front of my 08.1..
- Stop it. Go, sit there.

157
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,560
Don't move till I come hack.

158
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
When-is the victim?

159
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,030
Come..

160
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,290
I haven't seen you
before in Chandan Nagar.

161
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,370
Why? You get a police case everyday?

162
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,670
No, No.. I had gone to the police
station but did not see you there.

163
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,410
I just got transferred last week.

164
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,380
Oh! There . .

165
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,440
What is her condition?

166
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,040
That is the problem.

167
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,510
She seems to have gone into a coma.

168
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,120
Coma?

169
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,520
Yes.
It is an acute case of TBI..

170
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,030
Traumatic Brain Injury..

171
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,430
But I don't think it's permanent.

172
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,170
I am expecting her to recover
in the next five to six days...

173
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,070
But inspector. .

174
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,160
I have a different problem.

175
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:48,070
Her treatment is very expensive..
Who will bear her medical expenses?

176
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,380
At most I can keep her for two days,
beyond that it'll be very difficult.

177
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,380
It's ok Doctor.

178
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,550
I am sure she has someone.

179
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,010
Doctor, can you remove
this mask for a second?

180
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,710
I need to see her face.

181
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,110
Open it.

182
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,260
Durga?!

183
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,290
No no.. Bidya.

184
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:37,600
Vidya?

185
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,500
Yes. She is not Durga.
She is Bidya, Bidya Sinha.

186
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,190
Vidya Sinha?
How do you know?

187
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,470
Put it hack.

188
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,070
See.. this was with her.

189
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,540
When she was brought in.

190
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,340
Vidya Sinha.

191
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,210
You know her?

192
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,990
No.

193
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,060
Come with me..

194
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,400
Suddenly she came in front.

195
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,300
Happened in this junction..

196
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,740
- Here?
- Yes.

197
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,980
Hey police, hands up!

198
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,510
Hands up!

199
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,310
Stop crying..

200
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,620
Which way did she run in from

201
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,590
Hands up! Hands up!

202
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,350
I'll put you in jail!
I'll put you in jail!

203
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,510
O dada

204
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,010
Yes.

205
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,470
This is Bidya madam.

206
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,020
Where does she stay?

207
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,580
Who is it?

208
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,220
Police.

209
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,490
Police? Why?

210
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,620
You know her?

211
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,490
One second..

212
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,400
This is our Bidya..

213
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,630
I came down and saw no one is here..

214
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,130
I only locked up the house.

215
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,980
You locked up?

216
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,680
Yes. I have a spate key,
in case Mini needs any help.

217
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,240
Who's Mini?

218
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,510
Her daughter.

219
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,010
She has a daughter?!

220
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,550
Yes.

221
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,730
How old is she?

222
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,270
14 ,15 I don't know..

223
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,430
But the poor child is paralyzed.

224
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,230
Where is she now?

225
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:11,440
Not very sure.
Bidya also was asking where is Mini?

226
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,660
You said Mini is paralyzed?

227
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,550
Yes.

228
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,060
Below the waist.

229
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,260
Her wheelchair is here..
How can she go anywhere?

230
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,330
I don't know.

231
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,470
Maybe the nurse knows.

232
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,400
You have the nurse's number?

233
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,800
It's on that board.

234
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,360
Are you really in a coma or are
you trying to escape from me?

235
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,330
But how will you escape death Durga?

236
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,400
You are not answering...

237
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,700
I'll have to check myself.

238
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,610
Sorry I don't have the
time to clean this.

239
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,650
Okay then.

240
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:30,660
I won't kill Mini till you regain...

241
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,330
Who are you?
This is not visiting time.

242
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,120
Strange . .

243
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,590
So Vidya asked you not to come today?

244
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,430
Yes.

245
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,210
Ok.

246
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,410
Uncle. .

247
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,410
Uncle. .

248
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,780
You go up and rest.

249
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,560
Rashmi. .

250
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,220
Have you forgotten?

251
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,990
- What?
- You have a wife, a daughter...

252
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,020
I'll have to die to forget that.

253
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,500
Tsk Tsk.
What rubbish you speak!

254
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,400
Why?

255
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,170
You love me that much?

256
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,270
Nope.

257
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,640
Please talk to your daughter.

258
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,340
She is driving me crazy.

259
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,340
Daddy, I want a dog..

260
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,250
That is you mothers department
please ask her.

261
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,050
I asked. She said either she will
stay in the house or the dog.

262
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,050
Good.

263
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,580
This is good news.

264
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,780
Then maybe We should
get a dog immediately..

265
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,750
Why?
You found another wife?

266
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,220
Joking yaar!

267
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,560
When you coming home?
Have you seen the time?

268
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,290
Simran is also waiting for you..

269
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,230
You said 9 p.m..
It's midnight now!

270
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,070
Is this any time to come home?

271
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,330
Come hack quickly.

272
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,530
Have you had dinner?

273
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,800
Have you eaten anything?

274
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,340
Rashmi. Rashmi hold on.
I am coming.. Give me a minute..

275
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,340
Do you want to tell me something?

276
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,680
What? Why?

277
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,020
You look like it.

278
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,380
Why?
You Want to say something?

279
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,210
Yes.

280
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,420
Speak.

281
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,020
Can we go back to Kolkata?

282
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,420
What?
We just shifted a week hack!

283
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,060
It's so boring here!
Everyone goes to sleep by 9 p.m.

284
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,160
It's like this only in small towns.

285
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,270
What?

286
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,600
Everyone goes to sleep at nine.

287
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,210
Then why are we awake?

288
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,130
What happened?

289
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,500
She is not Durga.. Bidya.

290
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,440
- Who's Mini?
- Her daughter.

291
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,120
Something really
distubed me a lot today.

292
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,990
But I don't know whether
I heard it correctly..

293
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,700
Or was it a voice
from my own childhood.

294
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,630
It began as a routine
day at school...

295
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,520
Same old school work.
Fees, Syllabus etc etc..

296
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,250
But the person I wanted to
turn up didn't seem likely today.

297
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,970
Then maybe I spoke too soon..

298
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:09,730
As usual Mini Dewan was marched
into the Principal's office.

299
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:13,370
My only respite in
an otherwise boring day.

300
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,410
It happened at least once every week.

301
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,380
Stay here .

302
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,558
Mini Dewan! Come.

303
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:26,525
Sit.

304
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,232
But Mini never looked at me.

305
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:34,268
She just sits quietly
playing with her paper toys.

306
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:39,434
I tried many times to be her friend.
To talk to her.

307
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,635
But all my attempts ï¬‚opped.

308
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:47,008
It was impossible to he
friends with Mini Dewan.

309
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,646
Today Mrs. Burnett was
a little mole angry than usual.

310
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,018
Mrs. ... Oh.
She is not there?

311
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:52,578
No.

312
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,520
Durga! I just don't understand what
to do with this gill!

313
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:59,184
First she didn't
use to pay attention..

314
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,094
Now she has started falling
asleep during my class..

315
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,230
You keep on sitting here!
Nonsense.

316
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,199
I couldn't stop myself from laughing.

317
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,668
And then the day changed..

318
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,274
Mini smiled at me fol the first time.

319
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,374
Diksha...

320
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:20,972
Rosni...

321
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,613
Today her ca: was late..

322
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,546
So I gave it another shot.

323
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,589
Hello...

324
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,090
Your cat is late today.

325
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,494
You fell asleep in class today?

326
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,068
Your cat's hem..

327
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:48,169
Do you know my name?
My name is Durga.

328
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,545
Even I used go fall
asleep in my class.

329
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,550
Especially in Maths.

330
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,653
Is Mrs. Burnett very boring?

331
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,256
Must he. She looks it.

332
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,549
No.

333
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,717
Good grief.
You can speak?

334
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,655
Mrs.Burnett is not boring.

335
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,193
No? Then Maths is boring?

336
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:15,029
Maths is not boring.
Mrs. Burnett is not boring.

337
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,473
Then Why did you fall asleep in class?

338
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,501
Because they don't
let me sleep in the night.

339
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:26,005
I didn't understand what Mini said.

340
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:30,014
But before I could ask, the ca: left.

341
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,318
Because they don't
let me sleep in the night.

342
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:42,155
I don't know Why I buy fruits
everyday.. I don't like fruits..

343
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,230
But I need to change..

344
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:48,627
The doctor said I must
eat fruits for my skin to improve..

345
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,700
And I want to look better.

346
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,706
But not fol myself. fol Arum.

347
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,166
Durga.

348
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,648
I desperately wanted
to give life a second chance..

349
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,653
I met Arun in kalimpong last year.

350
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:06,717
I think he likes me.

351
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:10,983
Even though I am not sure
if I can give him what he wants.

352
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,255
Are you alright?

353
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,293
Yes.

354
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,264
Sure? You seemed lost.

355
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,234
No. I was just quiet.

356
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:22,994
Really?

357
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,107
Really... Why?

358
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,372
Because We just Walked
past your house..

359
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,684
Durga..

360
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,978
Would you like to come
out for diner tonight?

361
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,989
I wanted to say YES but.

362
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,090
Arun.. today..

363
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,320
Not a problem.
No need to rush.

364
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,995
Whenever you're comfortable...

365
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,058
The restaurant isn't going anywhere..

366
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,296
- It can't also..
- What?

367
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,569
Restaurant.

368
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,641
Ah yes.

369
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,210
But I can go..

370
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:03,104
Bye!

371
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,006
Bye.

372
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:30,066
I was angry with myself
fol saying no to Arun..

373
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,469
But I could not get What
Mini said out of my head.

374
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,444
Because they don't
let me sleep in the night.

375
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:46,046
Something really
distubed me a lot today.

376
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,722
But I don't know whether
I heard it correctly..

377
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,619
OI was it a voice
from my own childhood..

378
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,427
Wake up!

379
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:00,235
Are you reading a book?

380
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,299
No. It's a diary.

381
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,304
Whose diary?
Looks like a school diary.

382
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,372
It's evidence. From that hit and run...

383
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,341
I didn't even know..

384
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:11,342
What?

385
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,081
That you can read.

386
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,372
Ha Ha Ha..

387
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,420
Ramsingh come.

388
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,057
Call this nurse.
Ask her to come in..

389
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,359
And also... where do you
record all case related materials?

390
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:36,628
What, sir?

391
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:38,607
Case related materials, evidence?

392
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:43,510
Like this. From the accident case...

393
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,411
Does this station have
a book for recording?

394
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:51,312
No sir. Nothing happens
here in Chandan Nagar.

395
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,488
Nothing happens?

396
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,090
It's happening now?

397
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,222
Yes.

398
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,359
Go buy one.

399
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,688
- Yes sir.
- Thank you.

400
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,994
Over the next few days,
I tried talking to

401
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,069
I never got a chance..

402
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:11,697
Ma' am.

403
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:19,038
3 one's are 3...3 two's are 6...

404
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,311
I didn't know who to talk to..

405
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,782
And I know from my own past...

406
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,579
...that there is no point in talking
to anyone without proof..

407
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,055
I needed to get close to

408
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,787
That's the only Way
she would talk to me.

409
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,588
I needed a plan.

410
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,556
That day after school,
I looked through Mini's records.

411
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:42,528
I found Mini was Weak
in Maths and English.

412
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,744
I had completely forgotten
about Arun that week...

413
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,642
So has she vanished?

414
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,081
Guard? It's okay..

415
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:57,613
Didn't I tell you?

416
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:01,754
Hi.

417
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:05,688
Sorry. I did not
hear from you all week.

418
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:09,221
I , got worried..
So I...came here.

419
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:12,997
Yes.

420
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:18,501
I Wasn't used to
people caring fol me..

421
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,510
I forgot my umbrella.

422
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,155
You are Wet.

423
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:53,234

424
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,037

425
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,678

426
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,045

427
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,575
Keep them here .

428
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,180
I was scared.

429
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:08,321
I always wanted to
hide from everyone

430
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:13,018
I Wanted to he left alone
I don't Want anyone to touch me.

431

00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,030
I need some water.

434
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,537
But I need to get used to life..

435
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,634
If I have to start a new life..

436
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,338
I have to forget my childhood.

437
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,374

00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,108
I want Arun to like me..

439
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,215
I don't want Arun
to hate me like Inder.

440
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,059
Sir...

441
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:50,794

I think I found one but she Ian away.

00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,543
All relatives are like that.
They run away.

477
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:49,641
But inspector I can't keep
her more than one day..

478
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,315
It's too expensive fol me.

479
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:08,000
I needed to know What Mini meant.

480
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,966
And I was going to do
whatever I could to find out..

481
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,739
Who was not letting her sleep?

482
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,307
Guard?

483
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:15,973
Is there someone home?

00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,475

485
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,625

Hello.

487
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,166

00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,037
I had it all set.

490
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:47,665
I am from Mini's school.

491
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,767
Them is some concern
with Mini's performance.

492
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,536
You are in my house.

493
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:54,683
You must first introduce yourself.

494
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,613
Sorry.. My name is Durga Rani Singh.

495
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:00,984
You are from Kalimpong??

496
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:05,260
No. I was in Delhi and
then in Kolkata for some time..

497
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,951
Married?

498
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,125
No.

499
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,093
You are a teacher in Mimi's school?

500
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:12,594
I lied.
Yes.

501
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:15,001
Yes... Bye Mom!

502
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,042
Please tell me..

503
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,571
I explained to her
that Mimi's performance...

504
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,672
English and
Mathematics were pool..

505
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,618
And the school wanted to
help her with extra tuitions.

506
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:33,747
So Mini has to stay hack
in school fol an extra 110111?

507
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,081
Only two days a Week.

508
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:37,488
This was the only Way I could
get Mini alone.

509
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,655
Mini is only 6 years old.

510
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,526
R's um as if she is doing some
'AS exams.

511
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,065
No need to do all this now.

512
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:49,169
I'll call the headmistress
and thank her.

513
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,639
Oh no! That's the last thing I needed.
Her contacting the school...

514
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,109
But it's only an hour after school..

515
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,075
No.

516
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,373
I was losing. Last attempt.

517
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,518
I could come home and help

518
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,085
We are doing this with
some other students.

519
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,986
You are doing this
with other students also?

520
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,150
I lied again.

521
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:11,021
Yes.

522
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:18,558
Yes, sir.

523
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:21,966
I will be there.

524
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,739
Sir, she did not have a mobile..

525
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,174
Okay.

526
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,001
There you are Inder. You are back.

527
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,709
Sir! I was coming to see you only..

528
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,509
No no sir sir..

529
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,045
Listen.

530
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:08,511
Get me some tea.

531
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,015
I got a call from Maity's
nursing home.

532
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:13,484
- There is one hit and run case..
- Yes, sir I was there...

533
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:16,284
We need to move the victim
to a government hospital.

534
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:17,451
Sir have you gone mad?

535
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:18,526
Excuse me?

536
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,389
Patient is in a temporary coma..

537
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:24,496
Sir..It's only a matter of time
for her to come around.

538
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:25,632
Who will pay for her expenses?

539
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:26,793
I am sure she has someone.

540
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,128
Have you found anyone?

541
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:29,704
Not yet, but.

542
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,071
That's What the doctor told me.
So who will pay? You?

543
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:38,646
Please think before
you address your seniors.

544
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:44,415
Anyway..
Mole important mam-us.. See..

545
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:49,781
What happened to that tea?

546
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:51,254
What is this?

547
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:52,623
Durga Rani Singh.

548
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,460
Wanted for kidnapping and murder.

549
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,224
What?

550
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:57,692
Dangerous woman.

551
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:58,665
Sir tea?

552
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:02,727
She kidnapped a child in Kalimpong..

553
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,104
And when someone tried to stop her,
she murdered that person.

554
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,707
She has been spotted in Chandan Nagar.

555
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:14,378
Once Kalimpong? police arrives you will be
working with them to find this woman.

556
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,247
Rubbish sir.
She can't be a murderer.

557
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,148
How do you know?
You know her?

558
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:22,752
Sir.. look at her face? Look

559
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:24,690
You think she can kill someone?

560
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,423
My gut feel says that this
gill is not a murderer.

561
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,627
Inder you were all set to get
a promotion to Lalbazar, right?

562
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:39,031
You messed up your last
case with your gut feeling.

563
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:40,431
And instead of a
promotion to Lalbazar.

564
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,307
You got demoted to
Chandan Nagar.

565
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:47,675
So if I were you..

566
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:53,312
I would rely a little
less on my gut feeling.

567
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:54,385
Sorry sir.

568
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,823
Sir, got a new book.
We can record evidence here.

569
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:58,717
What evidence?

570
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:01,027
This diary?

571
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:05,267
Have you gone mad Ramsingh?
What did I tell you?

572
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,028
I asked you fol a diary like this?

573
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:13,005
Not some exercise book...

574
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,006
You forgot?
Get me another diary like this...

575
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,471
Thank you. Go now.

576
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:19,573
Whose diary is that?

577
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,014
This? This is my Wife's diary.

578
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,484
This is over.
She wanted another one..

579
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,382
- Oh your Wife's diary?
- Yes.

580
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:30,089
Good. So find out What
she thinks about you..

581
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:35,255
Inder, this hit and run case..
Who's the victim?

582
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,492
A local Woman.

583
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,134
Name?

584
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:46,536
Vidya Sinha.

585
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,137
Vidya Sinha, okay.

586
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:55,481
Hello.

587
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,515
Durga.. Your student.

588
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:59,378
From now she is you: responsibility..

589
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,454
And .
You must study properly,

590
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:05,717
School feels you
are very behind in class.

591
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,326
No... No.. Nothing like that.

592
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,159
Let me finish, please.

593
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,261
So Mini you must study properly.

594
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,262
Ma'am you need anything?

595
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,027
What would you like to have?

596
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:16,661
Ahhh...

597
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,404
She doesn't Want anything.

598
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:26,613
I could see Mini was
uneasy seeing me in the house.

599
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,478
I needed something
to make her comfortable.

600
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,711
Sit down Mini..

601
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,277
And I got it.

602
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:37,356
Ma'am I would need you to leave.

603
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:40,427
It would be better if
I could teach Mini alone..

604
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,128
You Want me to leave?

605
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,161
No.. Not like that.

606
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:46,697
You know What I mean!

607
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:52,263
I couldn't believe
that I winked at the lady.

608
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,265
Neither could she..

609
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:03,649
I was too much in a hurry.

610
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,386
Mini, remember What
you told me that day?

611
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:09,121
Who doesn't let you
sleep in the night?

612
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:14,723
Mini!

613
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:18,996
Why are you outside?

614
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,436
Mini I asked you a question?
Why have you left the room?

615
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,143
I asked her to get me some water.

616
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:32,475
Okay. In future just ring
the bell next to the table.

617
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:34,479
- The servant will come.
- Ok.

618
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:36,183
Come.

619
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:41,478
How could I forget, that unless
she wanted to talk herself.

620
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:44,615
I could not force her to talk.

621
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:46,628
What do you Want to do?

622
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:49,461
I had to first become her friend.
Her confidante.

623
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:53,160
A friend who she
can trust and talk to.

624
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:56,403
A friend who I never had.

625
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:07,640
Do you sell water colors?

626
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:12,450
I had read somewhere that painting
is a good way to bond with children...

627
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:14,615
Let's paint.

628
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:16,691
Take.

629
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,220
Can I use my fingers?

630
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:20,988
But they will get dirty. Use a brush.

631
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:25,231
I forgot Mini needs
to make her own choices.

632
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,563
Okay, use your fingers.

633
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:00,164
Mini.

634
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,271
Durga let me show you RAJNIGANDHA.

635
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:07,473
Rajnigandha?

636
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:08,540
Yep.

637
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:11,478
Vidya Sinha's Rajnigandha.

638
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:13,207
Who's Vidya Sinha?

639
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:22,122
I love Vidya Sinha.

640
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,324
What's this?

641
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:35,230
Draw.

642
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:00,026
Come..

643
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:03,960
Where you taking me?

644
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,360
MY Playroom;.

645
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,068
My god!

646
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,334
You have so many toys?

647
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:20,342
I spent 9 months with

648
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:22,508
But I still wasn't any closer
to the answer I was looking fol..

649
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:27,621
What happens to you?

650
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:28,985
Sorry..

651
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:29,681
No...No , it's all right.

652
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,487
Madam.. I have to go..

653
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:32,458
What's this?

654
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,421
Seems as if someone is
drawing on a repeat loop.

655
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,496
Arun made me realise
that Mini was not thawing.

656
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,160
She was repeating.

657
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:45,103
As if something is happening to her on
a repeat loop. Over and over again.

658
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:50,269
These zeroes were like secrets
coming out from inside her.

659
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:55,045
And that secret was hidden
somewhere inside this house

660
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,981
I had to find it.
I needed evidence.

661
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,584
Everything was normal.

662
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,489
I found nothing.

663
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,087
But I didn't know
what I was looking fol..

664
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:49,198
All I knew was that What happened to
me as a child should not happen to Mini

665
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:55,269
This world doesn't
need another Durga.

666
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:06,150
Yes?

667
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,353
Sorry.. I was looking for the toilet.

668
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,455
But this is my study..

669
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:14,594
Not that bad as a toilet. Is it?

670
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:18,592
No. No. Its nothing like a toilet.

671
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,267
In fact very neat and clean.

672
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,232
You are here
to tutor Mini right?

673
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:26,607
Yes.

674
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:31,703
There is a toilet downstairs
also, near the living room.

675
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:33,408
Oh. Okay.

676
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,676
Uhhh.. Sorry.

677
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:45,192
It looked so beautiful.
Like Japanese origami.

678
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,353
You like origami?

679
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,466
- Yes.
- Very good!

680
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,366
Let me make something fol you..

681
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,695
- No No.. Let me not brother you..
- Please. Please.

682
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,666
I insist.
You are a guest in our house.

683
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:27,659
For you.

684
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:30,661
Thank you.

685
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:33,506
- I better get back to
- Sure.

686
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:37,536
Next to the living room.

687
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:38,511
Sorry?

688
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:40,274
Toilet.
I thought you Wanted?

689
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:56,821
The food is not good?

690
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:00,068
Not good but very good

691
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:01,625
You approve of the cook?

692
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,698
I would hire this cook any day.

693
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,475
Good. There's an offer on..

694
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:09,170
What?

695
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:13,041
You can have this cook fol
life at a throwaway price..

696
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,407
Plus he will clean
the dishes fol flee.

697
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:16,641
Meaning?

698
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:21,312
I got a promotion.

699
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:24,617
I am now the international
manager of my publication.

700
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:26,693
Congratulations!

701
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:28,219
Thank you.

702
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:33,261
But I have to relocate to London..

703
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:36,029
Oh...

704
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,194
Let me finish.

705
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:44,208
Durga..

706
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:50,511
I would he honored if you married
me and come to London.

707
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:58,087
- OIL. Arum.
- No rush.

708
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:00,254
Take your time

709
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:04,460
I told Arun that I'd give him an
answer before he leaves.

710
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:06,495
As much as I was scared
of a marriage again...

711
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,226
Sit down !

712
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,201
...I really wanted to be with Arun.

713
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,501
Durga! What to do with this child?

714
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:15,269
Again she fell asleep in my class.

715
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:36,560
What's this?

716
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:44,663
Mini how did you hurt yourself?
Huh?

717
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,473
Mini didn't say a wold.

718
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,513
But I couldn't take it any mole.

719
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,513
- Where is Mini?
- Upstairs.

720
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:58,348
And running.. running..
running...running...he wins..

721
00:52:58,408 --> 00:52:59,443
Mini?

722
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:04,558
I can't come this Saturday.
So I have to teach Mini today.

723
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,225
Okay. Come.. Let's change.

724
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,465
Then-is no one I.n the house.
So I was just helping Mini to change.

725
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:12,998
I'll help her.

726
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:17,661
Ok. Mini time to study.

727
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,001
We will play later.

728
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:19,530
Come Mini!

729
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,106
Minn...

730
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:24,568
Her clothes .

731
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:36,353
I was sure he knew that I knew.
I had to move fast.

732
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,558
I am very angry ..may--

733
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:43,397
Why?

734
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:47,302
This man who I know..

735
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,695
he touched me here.

736
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:04,150
I don't like anybody touching
me here or here. Makes me very angry.

737
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:07,981
And it really hurts.

738
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,154
Especially here .

739
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:21,596
I was very neat to Mini's truth..
I needed to move very carefully.

740
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,596
He keeps touching me..

741
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,468
I don't know how to stop them.

742
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,673
Me too.

743
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:33,604
Yeah. I don't like it at all.

744
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:35,307
Yeah.

745
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:42,590
One of my friends touched me..

746
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:45,220
Who touched you Mini?

747
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,185
Mobil uncle..

748
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,228
- He keeps.
- Mini!

749
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:50,259
Yes.

750
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,663
Mini, you haven't drank your milk..

751
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:54,361
- Come.. quickly drink your
- Yes, uncle.

752
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:21,988
So you don't like anyone
touching you here and there?

753
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:27,298
She is an six year old child.
Your own niece.

754
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:30,462
But she likes it when
I touch her here and there.

755
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,470
What is you: problem?

756
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:38,207
Anything that I can fix?

757
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,380
But you are grown up now!

758
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,614
I will report you.

759
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,011
Do it.

760
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:50,389
Do it.

761
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:56,120
And What do you think
will happen to Mini if you did?

762
00:55:57,787 --> 00:56:00,700
What will happen to you?

763
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:11,036
What if suddenly there are people
who want to touch you here and there?

764
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:15,082
Mrs. Dewan..

765
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:18,380
I told her what her
son was doing with

766
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:19,019
What?

767
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:22,385
First she couldn't believe it..
Then she understood.

768
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:27,255
I did not know whether I was
feeling a sense of victory or relief.

769
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:31,158
But. Mini was finally safe.

770
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:39,270
My happiness was short-lived.

771
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:41,272
I don't understand?

772
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,373
Durga We are letting you go.

773
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,771
You have brought shame to this school.

774
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:50,444
You have impersonated a teacher and
stolen things from the Dewan family.

775
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:53,583
Be glad that the family is not pressing
any police charges against you.

776
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:58,287
Ma'am Mini is being
abused by her uncle.

777
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,452
- What?
- Even her grandmother knows this.

778
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:04,362
I had a suspicion and that's
why I did all this to find out..

779
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:08,595
And because I found out,
they are not going to the police.

780
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:11,696
Dewans? Are you blind?

781
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:15,132
Durga I know this family personally!

782
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:19,046
Mobil loves Mini like his daughter.

783
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:22,973
Why would a family
abuse their own child?

784
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:30,487
Unfortunately you
are the one Who's blind.

785
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:34,221
It was useless talking to Mr.Mason.

786
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:37,062
I did what I should've done long ago.

787
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,258
Keep the file.

788
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,996
- Yes?
- I want to report a child abuse.

789
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:50,041
Him.

790
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:51,705
- Mr.Mohit Dewan?
- Yes?

791
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:53,573
- Come this side!
- Why?

792
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:54,743
Come this side!

793
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:56,475
What's going on?

794
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,617
Where is Mini?

795
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:11,263
Let him go.

796
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,391
Sorry Mr. Dewan!

797
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:14,958
What? Why are you letting him go?

798
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:17,334
Mini hasn't said anything
which points to

799
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,303
...not have we found anything in the
house which can incriminate anyone.

800
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:22,634
She is a liar.
Check with the school.

801
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:24,975
- Sir please listen to me
- Please he quiet

802
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:29,549
She pretended to be a teacher
and stole from out house.

803
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:32,448
Call Liza Mason in
Scottish Missionaries.

804
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,519
Liza Mason..
Is this true?

805
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:36,448
- No.
- You didn't lie?

806
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:38,287
No I did lie that I'm a teacher.

807
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,418
So you are not a teacher?

808
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:41,985
- No I am not a teacher sir.
- Then why did you lie?

809
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:45,765
I mean I did pretend to be
a teacher... but not to steal..

810
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:47,468
- Now you are really wasting my time.
- No sir...

811
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:50,231
Ma'am she is a six year old ma'am.

812
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:53,000
She is a six year old child..
Your own granddaughter.

813
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:55,039
If you to have to save someone
save her.. not this monster.

814
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,524
Durga...

815
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:14,461
Durga..

816
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:24,733
Wait wait.

817
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:27,664
Durga.

818
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:31,138
I never gave Arun an answer.

819
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:34,481
That night Arun Went away to London.

820
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:39,252
I had to choose between Arun and
I chose

821
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:43,423
Are you still reading?

822
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:46,250
Yes .. Almost done...

823
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:52,455
I was really missing Arun.

824
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,466
Normally he would meet me here.

825
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:55,634
Durga!

826
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:03,439
Do you have any idea,
how much my mother loves me?

827
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:06,307
Why did you go to the police, Durga?

828
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,246
Because you are a pervert
and you need to be in jail.

829
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:12,516
How did you know?
I am curious. Are you an expert?

830
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,584
OI out of experience?

831
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:17,190
I would say its experience...

832
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,021
...especially if you don't like
being touched here and there.

833
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:24,725
So tell me.. When you grew up..
Did it affect you?

834
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,033
Are you married?

835
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,332
Can you be normal with you: partner?

836
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,037
They say these things spoil
your sex life, you get seated of sex?

837
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:35,804
Are you also scared?

838
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:41,709
For no reason you ended
Mimi's life Durga..

839
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,752
And now..
I hope you can live with that.

840
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,653
There was something
in Mohit's voice...

841
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:50,816
...which made me feel
very scared for Mini.

842
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:54,752
I needed to see her.
I needed to know she is safe.

843
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:03,427
There was no one in the house.

844
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,437
Mini?

845
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,436
I couldn't find Mini.

846
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:11,504
Mini...

847
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:14,439
Mini...

848
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:17,015
Mini...

849
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:20,781
Mini...

850
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:24,016
Mini...

851
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:25,617
Mini...

852
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:27,492
Mini...

853
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:30,156
What are you doing out there?
Come here.

854
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:31,493
Come inside.

855
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:33,793
Mini..

856
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,044
Mini...

857
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:49,514
Mini what are you doing here?

858
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:51,718
It's very scary here.
Let's go.

859
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,054
Its all my fault.

860
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:55,554
What?

861
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:58,750
Grandma told me its all my fault.

862
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:01,661
It would be
better if I wasn't there.

863
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:08,059
She did not mean it.

864
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:12,396
You are a very good girl ok?

865
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:15,409
I am a had gill.

866
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:18,703
Because of me mummy and daddy died..

867
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:23,710
Because of me Mobil
uncle is feeling sad..

868
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:26,485
It's all my fault.

869
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:30,385
It's not your fault.

870
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:32,788
Everything is going to he okay..
I promise.

871
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:34,761
Come.. Let's go inside.

872
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:37,359
I have to make it right.

873
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,397
Make What right?

874
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:44,534
You don't have to do anything..

875
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,764
Come inside.

876
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:48,502
- Come.
- It's all my fault.

877
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:52,109
- It's not you: fault.
- Grandma said it's all my fault.

878
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:55,815
You don't have to do anything.
Go inside.

879
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,275
MINI!!

880
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:12,762
Where are you going
at this time of the night?

881
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:15,491
Vidya Sinha.

882
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:23,070
Durga.. I don't know
if you can heat me..

883
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:28,481
What?

884
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:31,016
Police work. Go to sleep
or I will put you in jail..

885
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:38,382
Durga.. This is Inder.

886
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:46,026
I am so sorry Durga
but you never told me.

887
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:52,299
Today I realized after
reading you: diary.

888
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:59,411
Durga when we got married
we were too young..

889
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:01,674
..and we didn't understand much.

890
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:10,116
I didn't know you had so
much pain and hurt inside you..

891
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,755
I thought you just didn't like me.

892
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,595
DOCTOR! DOCTOR!

893
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:26,707
I am telling you doctor.
Her finger moved..

894
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:29,306
Where I am saying it didn't?

895
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:33,069
It may have.. But
sometimes it happens.

896
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:36,445
Doesn't mean anything.

897
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:38,643
It's purely a reï¬‚ex action.

898
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:40,119
But how?

899
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:40,677
Watch.

900
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:43,087
Get me a needle.

901
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:50,727
See? Did anything move?

902
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,261
Put some cotton.

903
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:22,525
And What do you think
will happen to Mini?

904
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:30,470
For no reason you ended
Mimi's life Durga.

905
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:34,071
It's all my fault.

906
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:39,375
MINI!!

907
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:01,624
Durga Rani Singh?

908
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:04,163
Yes.

909
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:05,330
May We come in?

910
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:07,101
Why is she here?

911
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,510
Durga.. You have filed some serious
accusations against my family...

912
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:12,736
I Wanted to explain to you..

913
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:16,246
You don't have to explain anything
to me. It's all with the police.

914
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,478
I think it's best we
take this matter inside..

915
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:20,487
to discuss it
out here in the open.

916
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:22,987
Come let's go inside.

917
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:25,992
Durga.. Mini is a child..

918
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:27,584
She says anything she Wants.

919
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,654
That doesn't mean it's all true.

920
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:35,363
Mini never got the
love of her parents. .

921
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:39,631
And that's Why she has been a little
mentally unstable since childhood.

922
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:41,606
Mini is not mentally unstable,
Mrs. Dewan!

923
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:45,076
It's you and your son
Who's mentally unstable.

924
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:46,477
Who did all those..

925
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:48,606
Mobil hasn't done anything to

926
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,413
He has. Mini told me herself

927
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,546
You can't rely on her words!

928
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:57,421
Tomorrow if she says that.

929
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:01,723
...you pushed her off the
roof and should I believe that?

930
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,434
So that's your solution?

931
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:14,337
Try and prove that Mini
is mad so nobody believes her?

932
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:15,966
Come on, Durga..
I have known Mini since birth.

933
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:17,636
And that's Why you allowed Mohit..

934
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,646
to abuse your own granddaughter
whom you know since birth?

935
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,273
Mohit loves Mini
like his own daughter.

936
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:25,979
That is not love, Mrs.
Dewan. That is abuse.

937
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,545
Then Why didn't Mini
say anything till now?

938
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:33,093
Surely she would know the
difference between love and abuse..

939
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:36,561
Tell me, Mrs. Dewan.

940
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:43,233
How does an six year old know the
difference between love and abuse?

941
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:46,001
How does she know...

942
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:50,175
that when someone touches her private
parts, that is not love hut abuse.

943
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:55,277
How does that six year old know
that there are toys..

944
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:59,009
but her uncle's private parts is not
a toy to play with?

945
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:02,579
How does she know that when her uncle
doesn't let her sleep at night...

946
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:05,489
It's not a game. It's abuse.

947
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:07,423
Tell me Mrs. Dewan?

948
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:13,157
How does an six year old know
the difference between love and abuse?

949
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:15,224
Durga.. this is going somewhere else..

950
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,699
So Withdraw the case
and let's settle this.

951
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:20,698
What do you Want?

952
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:25,410
All I want is to see you
and you: son in jail!

953
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:30,212
If Mini does not know the
difference between love and abuse...

954
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:32,041
it's because of YOU.

955
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:38,023
Durga have you said
this to anyone else?

956
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:40,756
No one. Why?

957
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:41,994
Good.

958
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:50,296
You go to the hospital
and take care of.

959
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:51,770
I will take care of this one.

960
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:55,539
Please don't hurt her..
She is only a child..

961
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:58,745
You should have minded
your own business.

962
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:02,682
Mrs. Dewan! Mrs. Dewan!!!

963
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:06,544
Hey? Why in such a hurry to die?

964
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:22,196
Sorry Durga. I didn't
have the time to sterilize this.

965
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:26,465
You are only making
it difficult for yourself.

966
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:30,076
It's up to you whether you
want a painful or a painless death.

967
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:32,240
It's very simple..

968
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:38,108
A lonely gill, unmarried
lost her job..

969
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:41,519
Slashes her wrist in depression.

970
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,362
What's that?

971
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:30,229
Nothing. This is going
to help you to sleep.

972
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:33,700
But I don't Want to sleep.
I Want to go home.

973
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:39,202
Didn't uncle and I give you
so many toys and dresses?

974
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:42,072
So that you don't tell
anyone outside?

975
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:44,346
Did We not give you?

976
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:49,054
But you didn't do
What I told you to do..

977
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:53,220
I am sorry.
I will not do it again.

978
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:55,659
I Want to go home.

979
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:58,264
Sister, which room is Mini Dewan in?

980
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,595
- Mini Dewan..cabin number 29.
- 29.

981
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,533
L.1...

982
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:11,534
I don't Want to sleep.
I am scared.

983
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,580
Well, it's all your fault,

984
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:16,407
Mini.

985
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:23,489
It's not her fault, It's not
her fault. Say it's not her fault..

986
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:26,220
It's YOUR fault.
She is only a six year old child..

987
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,228
Say it's not her fault.

988
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:53,576
Mildâ€

989
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:58,417
Come on, let's get
you out of here...

990
01:11:58,514 --> 01:11:59,492
Grandma?

991
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:01,653
She's gone to sleep.

992
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:03,563
Do I have to sleep also?

993
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:07,761
No no. As long as I am alive
nothing will happen to you.

994
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:09,568
Promise .

995
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:57,108
You have grown..

996
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,614
I missed you.

997
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:06,392
Everyone loves spelling?

998
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:08,561
- Yeah.
- And you're not scared of aunty?

999
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,392

- Hi Daddy...

1000
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:11,654

Bye Daddy.-

1005
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:33,050
Where were you all night?

1006
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:36,486
Rashmi.... I'll drop
her to school from tomorrow.

1007
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:39,151
Why? If you have so much
time to spate, spend it with me.

1008
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,022
Not like that, yaar!

1009
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:43,588
You're not coming in?

1010
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:44,690
Coming.

1011
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:51,668
Listen.. I have to go to Kolkata..

1012
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:55,401
Wow! And when I Want to go

01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:57,569
Don't joke. There is
something I need to do..

01:13:57,633 --> 01:13:59,340
Something important?

I don't want to know.

Now go.

1026
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:37,517
What are you doing?

1027
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:33,668
You're not supposed to get up.

1028
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:36,499
- I need to leave..
- llama! llama!

1029
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,735
Please lie down

1030
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:39,638
What happened?

01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:42,045
Prepare a sedative. Quick.
You lie hack.

1032
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:43,208
Sister I. .

What is going on here?
What are you doing?

1034
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:47,647
I need to leave..
I have to go to Kolkata.

1035
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,416
Give me the sedative.

1036
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:51,786
Put her hack in bed.

1037
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:53,687
- Slowly.
- Oho.

1038
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:55,290
It has started bleeding.

1039
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,692
Slowly.

1040
01:15:56,752 --> 01:16:01,326
Your stitches have come apart now..
I have to re-stitch them...

1041
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:03,402
What happened to me?

1042
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,667
You have been in an accident.

1043
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:08,435
I am calling the police.

1044
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:10,699
- They will come and explain.
- Police?

1045
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:18,442
Doctor please don't call the police..
please don't call the police..

1046
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:20,378
Sir, you called?

1047
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:22,988
Yes.

1048
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:29,595
What was that drama yesterday
about the diary and evidence book?

1049
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:34,360
Sir .. He first told me that diary
is evidence from that accident case..

1050
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:35,992
He has to record it.

1051
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:37,731
So I went and bought
the exercise book.

1052
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:41,167
Then in flout of you he said
it's his Wife's diary.

1053
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:44,642
I was very confused..
where did this wife come ï¬‚ora?

1054
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:48,146
This is that Maity nusing home case?

1055
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:50,013
I think so, sir.

1056
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:53,351
Where is Inder?

1057
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:55,445
He came in the morning, then left.

1058
01:16:57,212 --> 01:16:58,555
Wait I will call him.

1059
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:17,641
The number you are trying
to reach is unavailable.

1060
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:20,179
Sir , inspector Singh's
phone is coming switched off.

1061
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:23,045
Call the police station.
See if Haldar is there.

1062
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:24,382
Yes sir.

1063
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:26,415
But why didn't you shift her?

1064
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:30,019
I had ordered Inder to shift her.

1065
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:31,987
That problem was solved.

1066
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:35,286
Inspector Singh offered
to pay for her expenses.

1067
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:38,630
What I? Inder offered to pay?

1068
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:40,659
- Ramsingh..
- Yes Sir!

1069
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:42,360
Get my car out..

1070
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:45,638
These new boys think
they are too smart.

1071
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:47,234
But I am smarter.

1072
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,536
- Definitely.
- Move it.

1073
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:53,477
Quickly

1074
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:54,707
Take.

1075
01:17:57,773 --> 01:18:00,720
I am finding this very
hard to believe, inspector..

1076
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:06,623
Are you sure you are not
confusing Bidya with someone else?

1077
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:10,592
Trust me, doctor.
Nobody is mole surprised than I am.

1078
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:15,624
But it is true that
Durga Rani Sing]: is a Wanted criminal.

1079
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:18,261
She kidnapped Mini, and maybe...

1080
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,167
...responsible fol the
death of Mimi's grandmother.

1081
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:23,203
- See this.
- What?

1082
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:29,015
And this Durga.. Is Bidya?

1083
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:30,144
Yes.

1084
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:36,684
But.. if she is not her mother why would she
go through all the trouble to cure Mini?

1085
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:38,550
I don't know, doctor.

1086
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:42,153
But I intend to find out.

1087
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:45,021
But now you are telling
me they are fake passports.

1088
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:46,297
Absolutely.

1089
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:48,264
These are false names.

1090
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:50,529
How can they be fake?

1091
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:52,538
Visas were issued on these passports...

1092
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:57,074
You have no idea how much
talent We have in out country.

1093
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:18,030
You know Goopi?

1094
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:28,174
Uncle? You know where
I can find Goopi?

1095
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:37,346

makes these fake passports.

1109
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:12,335

1165
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:44,743
I know you are desperate
for a promotion...

1166
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:48,453
But that doesn't mean you circumvent
me and keep me in the dark.

1167
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:50,248
- Sir I..
- You knew this was...

1168
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,552
the same Durga Rani
but you didn't tell me..

1169
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:55,488
Because you wanted
to take all the credit.

1170
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,129
You wanted to he the hem.

1171
01:25:57,318 --> 01:26:02,529
Even though I am the one who
told you she is a Wanted criminal.

1172
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:04,561
sir, you got it all wrong.

1173
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:05,562

1175
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:10,501
Wand only when it was confirmed
I was going to come to you.

1176
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:12,000
What confirmation?

1177
01:26:12,133 --> 01:26:15,444
Sir, when you told me, I was
not sure if it was the same Woman.

1178
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:19,981
I got a lead to a
doctor Sen in Kolkata.

1179
01:26:20,408 --> 01:26:24,720
I Went and found out that she is the
same Durga Rani Singh.

1180
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:26,324
She is..

1181
01:26:27,549 --> 01:26:32,589
Sir she was planning to leave the
country using false documents.

1182
01:26:34,088 --> 01:26:35,590
This Woman? Rubbish.

1183
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:38,001
Not possible.

1184
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,230
See this.

1185
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:42,207
Proof.

01:26:44,165 --> 01:26:45,143

1187
01:26:52,473 --> 01:26:53,747

01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:57,282

1189
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:58,656
I don't believe..

1190
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:04,963
Anyway.. Tomorrow we take her
back to Kolkata and hand her over.

1191
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:11,004
Sir after we catch her..
My promotion is guaranteed, right?

1192
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:18,634
Let's do our work.
Promotion will come.

1193
01:27:20,535 --> 01:27:22,105
Excuse me sir?

1194
01:27:23,438 --> 01:27:26,248
- What is it?

1195
01:27:26,641 --> 01:27:27,346
What is this?

1196
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:28,613
Sir you see.

1197
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:37,495
What is this?

1198
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:40,498
The bill for Bed 21.
That accident case.

1199
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:42,535
The doctor got it wrong..

1200
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:46,332
What I told him was I will take
care if it is mole than two days.

1201
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:48,006
Doesn't mam-m.
Take this hack. I will talk to him.

1202
01:27:48,129 --> 01:27:50,473
Sir, you only give it hack to
OI he will shout at me.

1203
01:27:50,531 --> 01:27:52,636
Arch.. is this a joke or what?

1204
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,003
How can you give me a hill
of 65.000 rupees like this?

1205
01:27:55,169 --> 01:27:57,342
You should have at least
called me before making this bill.

1206
01:27:57,405 --> 01:27:59,749
I tried calling you, sir..
Your phone was off.

1207
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:01,487
I even called your house..

1208
01:28:01,542 --> 01:28:02,350
You did WHAT?

1209
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:06,983
sir you only said to call
home if your mobile was off...

1210
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:10,620
The number you are trying
to reach is currently not available.

1211
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:12,961
Where is daddy?

1212
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:14,397
I don't know.

1213
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:21,338
Is that daddy's diary?

1214
01:28:22,163 --> 01:28:23,107
I don't know.

1215
01:29:05,306 --> 01:29:06,114
Hey!

1216
01:29:07,475 --> 01:29:08,977
You scared me..

1217
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:11,281
I heard your hike.

1218
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,350
You're not coming up?

1219
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:16,553
I was just about to come up.

1220
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:19,429
You started smoking again?

1221
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:22,362
Cigarette? I quit long hack.

1222
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:31,177
You promised you'll quit.

1223
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:32,503
I did. I have.
Look.. just once in a While.

1224
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:33,705
But Why didn't you tell me?

1225
01:29:34,302 --> 01:29:37,181
Rashmi, I don't smoke regularly..
Once in a while..

1226
01:29:40,108 --> 01:29:43,453
If I told you.. You would
get Worried fol no reason.

1227
01:29:43,678 --> 01:29:45,089
So you hid it from me?

1228
01:29:45,613 --> 01:29:46,455
Yes.

1229
01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:50,187
What else have you hidden from me?

1230
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,290
You read the diary?

1231
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:54,230
NO.

1232
01:29:54,989 --> 01:29:56,332
Why would I read someone else's diary?

1233
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:59,262
You are my husband.
You tell me.

1234
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:14,246
You both need to he quiet.

1235
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:17,553
Because in case the
constable outside wakes up..

1236
01:30:18,045 --> 01:30:21,390
- I'll have to put him to sleep.
- You?

1237
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:23,293
Where is Mini?

1238
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:25,188
- What?
- Where is Mini?

1239
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:28,393
Where is my daughter?

1240
01:30:28,656 --> 01:30:29,600
Daughter?

1241
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:33,436
Yes. Definitely looks like you..

1242
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:40,602
She is waiting for
you to come and save her.

1243
01:30:41,235 --> 01:30:44,580
Please let her go.
I am begging you.

1244
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:46,518
How do I let her go Durga?

1245
01:30:46,674 --> 01:30:51,384
In my whole career,
only you two escaped from me.

1246
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:56,785
And when I take money for work.
I always finish it.

1247
01:30:57,218 --> 01:31:00,165
Even if it takes eight years.

1248
01:31:00,755 --> 01:31:04,760
Anyway .. I need 'you' to kill

1249
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:07,662
What?

1250
01:31:11,566 --> 01:31:13,136
She is your daughter no?

1251
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:17,180
Because as a mother you will obviously
want the best for your child.

1252
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:18,574
Yes?

1253
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:22,117
Please..

1254
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:28,125
You want to given her a peaceful death
or a painful one..

1255
01:31:41,229 --> 01:31:45,302
So if you reach by tomorrow evening..
You can kill her yourself.

1256
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:46,673
In a peaceful Way.

1257
01:31:55,076 --> 01:31:56,453
Like this.

1258
01:31:57,411 --> 01:32:00,585
BUT IF YOU don't, them.

1259
01:32:07,088 --> 01:32:08,089
Tomorrow. 5 p.m.

1260
01:32:10,124 --> 01:32:11,296
Be there .

1261
01:32:39,453 --> 01:32:41,729
Does anyone else know
that she is your ex-wife?

1262
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:44,392
No, no one.

1263
01:32:47,662 --> 01:32:49,573
It was hardly a marriage, Rashmi.

1264
01:32:50,264 --> 01:32:53,768
Even I didn't remember
Durga till I saw her again..

1265
01:32:54,368 --> 01:32:57,144
Do you believe her story?

1266
01:32:58,472 --> 01:32:59,678
I don't know...

1267
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:02,145
But Why would someone
write lies in their diary?

1268
01:33:02,276 --> 01:33:04,517
And the other kidnapping
and murder story?

1269
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:07,385
My gut feeling says
that Durga is not like that.

1270
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:14,193
The last time you had a gut feeling
We ended up in Chandan Nagar...

1271
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:17,128
I'm a Policeman, Rashmi.
I've stayed two years with hen.

1272
01:33:18,659 --> 01:33:21,299
She was my wife.

1273
01:33:27,301 --> 01:33:31,249
Rashmi? Why are you crying?

1274
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:38,019
Should I he Worried?

1275
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,016
Durga was my wife.

1276
01:33:41,582 --> 01:33:42,720
You are my Wife now.

1277
01:33:44,218 --> 01:33:47,290
Then don't do anything
that will affect out daughter.

1278
01:33:48,656 --> 01:33:49,657
Never.

1279
01:33:51,726 --> 01:33:53,399
Even if I Wanted to I can't.

1280
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:58,772
Tomorrow she will be handed over to
Kalimpong? police and end of story.

1281
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:02,240
I need to tell you something..

1282
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:06,710
Yes sir.

1283
01:34:07,274 --> 01:34:08,344
What?

1284
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:10,019
Coming.

1285
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:13,354
Durga has escaped
from the nursing home..

1286
01:34:45,613 --> 01:34:49,151
Hey? Do you Want to marry me?

1287
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:56,259
How could you let her escape?

1288
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:58,564
But, sir... she said she
wanted to go to the toilet..

1289
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:02,005
And also that Woman died..
In that confusion..

1290
01:35:02,096 --> 01:35:03,404
In that confusion..

1291
01:35:03,464 --> 01:35:04,602
What happened?

1292
01:35:04,665 --> 01:35:06,269
She passed away in her sleep.

1293
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:09,712
Look at him?
Did I ask you to Watch this Woman?

1294
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:11,643
Then Why did you not stay with Durga?

1295
01:35:13,307 --> 01:35:15,651
- But how can I go to ladies toilet?
- Shut up!

1296
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:57,525
She should not go
out of Chandan Nagar

1297
01:35:57,585 --> 01:35:58,325
Yes sir!

1298
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:02,726

1299
01:36:03,057 --> 01:36:05,196

Who's upstairs?

1309
01:38:44,652 --> 01:38:46,723

He got shot.

1329
01:39:45,346 --> 01:39:46,416
Hello.. Haldar.

1330

01:39:48,515 --> 01:39:50,756
Yes.. but no harm done..
Just a ï¬‚esh wound.

1332
01:39:51,218 --> 01:39:52,526

No one.

1334
01:39:57,157 --> 01:39:58,135
What do you mean 'no one?

1335
01:39:58,192 --> 01:40:01,071
One dangerous criminal
Durga Rani Singh...

1336
01:40:01,261 --> 01:40:05,073
Inder had a narrow escape..
Four inches this side and goodbye.

1337
01:40:05,766 --> 01:40:10,647
The woman whose hospital bills
you were going to pay.. she shot you?

1338
01:40:12,473 --> 01:40:16,387
No no Inder did that
to keep her here..

1339
01:40:16,443 --> 01:40:18,445
We can watch hen.

1340
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:20,581
She doesn't escape.

1341
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:22,551
Yes.

1342
01:40:25,719 --> 01:40:27,699
Rashmi?

1343
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:30,798
Rashmi, wait. .

1344
01:40:31,025 --> 01:40:33,096
Rashmi .. Listen.

1345
01:40:34,561 --> 01:40:35,505
What happened?

1346
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:37,398
It's my job, Rashmi.

1347
01:40:37,564 --> 01:40:39,441
- No, it's NOT.
- Shhhh.

1348
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,070
Had you told everyone
the truth the first day..

1349
01:40:41,168 --> 01:40:42,806
This Wouldn't have happened.

1350
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:46,549
Rashmi. the bullet hardly touched me.
I am okay.. Nothing happened.

1351
01:40:46,707 --> 01:40:49,119
- You said I had nothing to Worry about.
- You don't.

1352
01:40:49,209 --> 01:40:51,052
But you are still defending her!

1353
01:40:51,245 --> 01:40:53,122
What if it hit you
four inches this side?

1354
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,055
What if something happened to you?

1355
01:40:55,182 --> 01:40:57,594
Did you even once think
of Simran or the baby?

1356
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:02,125
Baby? What?

1357
01:41:05,292 --> 01:41:06,293
Are you pregnant?...

1358
01:41:08,462 --> 01:41:11,068
Rashmi is this a
Way to give such news?

1359
01:41:11,265 --> 01:41:13,142
Inder?

1360
01:41:14,468 --> 01:41:18,041
Sir, no one since I have been here..

1361
01:41:18,705 --> 01:41:20,343
When did the last train leave?

1362
01:41:20,474 --> 01:41:22,078
The last train left long hack.

1363
01:41:22,176 --> 01:41:23,052
She is not here.

1364
01:41:23,477 --> 01:41:24,751
- Anything?
- No sir,

1365
01:41:25,345 --> 01:41:26,016
Okay '

1366
01:41:26,046 --> 01:41:27,457
Sir, I think she
has left fol Kolkata.

1367
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:29,254
I have the same feeling.

1368
01:41:31,618 --> 01:41:34,189
You: men came all the
way from Chandan Nagar.

1369
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:36,029
To tell us that they
found this woman...

1370
01:41:37,491 --> 01:41:38,731
And then lost her?

1371
01:41:42,162 --> 01:41:43,266
Looks like it.

1372
01:41:43,597 --> 01:41:45,577
Sir if I'm not mistaken..

1373
01:41:45,632 --> 01:41:47,543
..this Chandan Nagar is just
about the size of a football ground.

1374
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:50,044
How can she escape from there?

1375
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:51,044
How?

1376
01:42:22,436 --> 01:42:23,574
Excuse me, Ma'am..

1377
01:42:27,207 --> 01:42:29,016
What are you doing here?

1378
01:42:29,176 --> 01:42:31,747
I am looking fol the exit.

1379
01:42:33,113 --> 01:42:35,150
Come with me, Ma'am.
I'll show you where it is.

1380
01:42:36,016 --> 01:42:41,466
I don't understand why this woman
would come to Kolkata from Kalimpong?

1381
01:42:41,555 --> 01:42:43,398
If she wanted to escape, she would
have run fa: away!

1382
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:46,170
Why come to a place so close?

1383
01:42:50,531 --> 01:42:53,671
Only a Week hack We
found new information..

1384
01:42:54,468 --> 01:42:57,540
that she was once married
to someone in Kolkata.

1385
01:42:58,205 --> 01:43:00,185
Maybe to meet or seek help from him.

1386
01:43:01,408 --> 01:43:02,318
Who?

1387
01:43:02,409 --> 01:43:05,686

Nothing - Are you okay?

1413

Have they hurt you?

1414
01:45:45,372 --> 01:45:46,783

Both of you are going

You can't get away with murder.

01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:04,360
Why not, Durga?

1423
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:08,366
You did, didn't you?

1424
01:46:14,134 --> 01:46:15,704

01:46:15,969 --> 01:46:16,970

Don't worry it's clean.

01:46:42,562 --> 01:46:44,564
I Won't do it.

01:46:45,031 --> 01:46:46,635
What choices do you have?

1435
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:47,337
Take it.

01:46:47,401 --> 01:46:48,744
Even if I let you go..

1437
01:46:49,069 --> 01:46:51,015

Oh? A twist in the tale?

01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:13,997
Stop this nonsense and just kill her.

01:47:14,494 --> 01:47:17,236
At least you kill fol money..

Inder is an idiot.

Screwed up his promotion...

1471
01:49:15,615 --> 01:49:17,686

01:50:21,715 --> 01:50:23,524
They never helped me..

1492
01:50:24,017 --> 01:50:25,462
They are all
the same..

1493
01:50:25,552 --> 01:50:26,690

Inder why did Durga call you?

1500
01:50:48,341 --> 01:50:51,185

As long as I'm alive..
Nothing will happen to you.
