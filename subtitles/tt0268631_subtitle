1
00:00:10,457 --> 00:00:14,188
'You don't like to dwell
on the royal dome.'

2
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:15,455
'You are an Eagle.'

3
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:20,859
'You rest only on the peaks
of high mountain.'

4
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,404
l'll not drive the boat now.

5
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:57,341
Why not?

6
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:58,745
l'm hungry.

7
00:03:58,818 --> 00:03:59,876
Again you are hungry?

8
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:01,545
Yes. Again.

9
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:03,155
You ate so much in the morning.

10
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:04,622
Even the hotel people
are tired of you.

11
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:07,626
You ate so much, but
still you want more.

12
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:09,286
Yes.

13
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:17,700
Ah! Ah!
- Ah! Ah! Help!

14
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:26,305
Hey, look! He is coming once again.

15
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:28,176
lf he comes again, l'll
teach him a lesson..

16
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:29,510
..which he will remember
all his life.

17
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:53,539
The boys think that if they
make a pass at girls..

18
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:55,871
..the girls will love
them. Nonsense!

19
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:00,672
Shall l say something, Geeta?

20
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:02,546
Tell me. Why do you ask?

21
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:05,275
Whatever it is, the
boy is good looking.

22
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:07,147
You shut up!

23
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:17,223
Aren't you ashamed to harass girls?

24
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:20,165
ls it ladylike that
you throw at me..

25
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:22,167
..whatever that comes in your hand?

26
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:23,763
What if the boat had capsized?

27
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:26,704
l'm thinking about the same. Why the
boat collided for no reason at all?

28
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:30,573
What do you mean? lf l had gun in
my hand, l'd have shot at you.

29
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:31,702
lt was just an apple.

30
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:35,372
The apple is lovely and then it
was hit by you. So l'm finished.

31
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:37,245
He is in mood of love.

32
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:38,375
Shut up!

33
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:39,509
She got it right.

34
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:56,201
You know? How much..
- Oh..

35
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:59,534
Hello, Geeta!

36
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:02,200
Hello. - Waiter!

37
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:06,407
Waiter, bring cutlet
and coffee for me.

38
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:08,478
Cutlet and plain coffee for me.

39
00:06:08,548 --> 00:06:09,606
Sandwich and tea.

40
00:06:09,683 --> 00:06:11,412
Bring cashew nuts and
ice-cream for me.

41
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:14,351
Waiter, bring cheese sandwich
and coffee for me.

42
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:17,680
Geeta, look, he has come once again.

43
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:36,700
Waiter! - Yes, sir.

44
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:39,368
What has the madam sitting on the
table in front of me ordered?

45
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:41,175
She has ordered many things.

46
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:42,373
Bring all those for me.

47
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:43,507
Ok, sir.

48
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:47,378
Look Shobha, he is deliberately
staring at me.

49
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:48,580
You don't think about him at all.

50
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:50,179
Look, Geeta, how he
is looking at us!

51
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:51,518
l'll teach him a lesson right away.

52
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:53,183
Don't be crazy, Geeta, the
more you get disturbed..

53
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:54,783
..the more he will harass you.

54
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:56,192
Why is he harassing me?

55
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:29,761
Look, Shobha, once again
he has mocked at me.

56
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:31,557
He is mocking at all of us.

57
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:40,167
Bad mannered!

58
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,367
Shobha, l cannot sit here
anymore. l'll go.

59
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:45,367
Look! Listen! Please forgive me.

60
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:47,504
The sneeze was not deliberate.
lt was automatic.

61
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:51,709
You know it well that sneeze is
natural, it comes involuntarily.

62
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:54,379
This is correct, Geeta.

63
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:55,512
Shobha!

64
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:58,453
Please explain it to her.
You look sensible.

65
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:13,202
This program is organised for the
school children. For their aid.

66
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:18,744
We thank P.S. college,
Delhi and Ms. Geeta.

67
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:25,147
Ms. Geeta is here with her friends
to help the poor children.

68
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:28,285
Sangeeta loves her face so much.

69
00:08:28,354 --> 00:08:29,412
What else to do, Geeta?

70
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:32,214
Don't worry, you are very beautiful.

71
00:08:32,492 --> 00:08:34,551
All the time only girls say so.

72
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:37,221
Oh! So you want a boy
to say this to you?

73
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:40,228
l'm not lucky like you.

74
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,495
You came here, and you met
him on the motorboat.

75
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:44,230
Perhaps he'll come here too.

76
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:46,772
Don't talk about him. lf he comes
here, then l'll not dance.

77
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,367
The man, who was driving the
motorboat, has arrived here.

78
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:54,505
He has come here? Now l'll not
dance. l'll not dance in any case.

79
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:56,640
What are you saying, Geeta. You
have come here for the charity show.

80
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:58,581
Yes, you are here for
the charity show.

81
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:01,381
l'll not dance at all. And
this is my final decision.

82
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:02,716
l'll go from here right now.

83
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:09,519
Though this night is colourful.

84
00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:16,133
Though this night is colourful.

85
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:20,798
This night has the poison
of sorrow in it.

86
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:30,478
lnside the poetic words there
is hint of grievance.

87
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,486
Though this night is colourful.

88
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:45,162
You listen to it, l'll
recite some couplets.

89
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:50,362
l want to get some disbursement.

90
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:56,772
For the children of this nation.

91
00:09:57,243 --> 00:10:02,442
They should get some donation.

92
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,710
But with the money
from this donation.

93
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:13,715
How many children can complete
their studies?

94
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,720
How many of them do well?

95
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:23,599
How many of them can succeed?

96
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:30,469
Though this night is colourful.

97
00:10:30,743 --> 00:10:35,271
This night has the poison
of sorrow in it.

98
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:40,279
Though this night is colourful.

99
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:49,217
Though there no lack of money.

100
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:54,426
But poor do not get it.

101
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:06,173
The coins come out of
the mint very fast.'

102
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:16,183
But then they get
hidden somewhere.'

103
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:22,794
Though this night is colourful.

104
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:27,594
This night has the poison
of sorrow in it.

105
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:32,530
lnside the poetic words
there is hint of grievance.

106
00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:37,269
lnside the poetic words
there is hint of grievance.

107
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:42,278
Though this night is colourful.

108
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:00,557
Listen! Listen!

109
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,237
Did you like my poetry?

110
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:09,240
When you come
the poetry comes alive.

111
00:12:09,842 --> 00:12:12,572
l ask to be forgiven if
l doing something wrong.

112
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:20,242
Hey, hurry up! The car
is waiting below.

113
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:21,377
Come on, hurry up.

114
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:22,580
We must reach Ranikhet
before it is evening.

115
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,713
Where is my lipstick?

116
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,519
Are you going for a picnic
or for a beauty show?

117
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:42,206
Even today it is not warm.

118
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:43,867
Look, how cold my hands have become?

119
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:46,211
lt's very cold here.

120
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:47,605
There must be snowfall somewhere.

121
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:34,521
Err!!
- Oh!

122
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:39,193
Why did you stop me? You should have
let me get lost in the landscape.

123
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:43,194
So soon! Come on, l'll show
you more beautiful scenes.

124
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:34,583
The evening has set on
the mountain trees.

125
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:42,789
The evening has set on
the mountain trees.

126
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:51,601
There is soft light, the
darkness is inching ahead.

127
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:55,334
There is soft light.

128
00:14:58,277 --> 00:15:02,145
The day and night meet.

129
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:06,682
Like two loving hearts.

130
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:10,483
The day and night meet.

131
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:15,156
Like two loving hearts.

132
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:23,567
The sky is happy and it has
spread colour everywhere.

133
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:27,436
The sky is happy.

134
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:47,724
There is poetry in
the still waters.

135
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:55,791
There is poetry in
the still waters.

136
00:15:56,335 --> 00:16:04,606
There is fragrance in
the wet atmosphere.

137
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:12,812
There is fragrance in
the wet atmosphere.

138
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:16,821
On the mountain trees.

139
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:36,706
Why one wouldn't fall in love
in this lovely scenery?

140
00:16:36,776 --> 00:16:44,581
Why one wouldn't fall in love
in this lovely scenery?

141
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:48,778
There is the glow of light.

142
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:53,449
There is joy everywhere.

143
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:57,326
There is the glow of light.

144
00:16:57,396 --> 00:17:01,457
There is joy everywhere.

145
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:05,262
On the mountain trees.

146
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:18,478
Why would our heart long
for any other view?

147
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:26,287
Why would our heart long
for any other view?

148
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:34,760
Since l found you the
whole world is mine.

149
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:43,242
Since l found you the
whole world is mine.

150
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:51,307
The evening has set on
the mountain trees.

151
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:55,252
On the mountain trees.

152
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:05,527
Please excuse me, l got delayed.

153
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,135
Why are you quiet?
What is the matter?

154
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:13,532
My mother is very sick. l received
a telegram a while back.

155
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:15,673
ls she sick since long?

156
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,800
When l left home she was
perfectly all right.

157
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:19,202
l don't know what happened.

158
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:20,404
You must go soon.

159
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,805
Geeta, l.. - Nobody in the world
is bigger than mother.

160
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:26,147
l used to think the same. But now..

161
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:29,346
..l think when l lose you,
my heart with be broken.

162
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:31,687
We're going to be together
for lifetime.

163
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,684
A few months of solitude
will pass very soon.

164
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:37,559
Telegram me as soon as you reach
there about mother's health.

165
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:43,359
Greetings, daddy.

Bless you, son. You came
at the right time.

167
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:46,166
Daddy, how is mother?

168
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:48,237
Go and see her yourself.

169
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:49,501
Daddy!
- Go.

170
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:55,712
'Om.. Agnaye swaha.'

00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,847
'Om.. Yamay swaha.'

172
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:03,517
'Om.. lndray swaha.'

173
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,787
'Om.. Prajapatye swaha.'

174

Mother! mother, what happened?

175
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:14,726
Madan, you have arrived, my son?

176
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,131
Yes, mother.

177
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:18,261
l was very impatient
to meet you, son.

178
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:21,799
Mother, you are okay, so why did you
sent a telegram and called me here?

179
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:26,269
Today l'm ok. l'm alive. But no one
knows what will happen tomorrow.

180
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:27,607
Mother, what will happen tomorrow?

181
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,807
Son, tomorrow the inauspicious
time begins.

182
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:32,214
So how could l allow you
to stay at Nainital?

183
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:34,548
Mother, l was so happy there that..
- ls that so?

184
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,485
Yes, mother.
- What was so special?

185
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:39,155
Nothing, mother. The
weather was so good.

186
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:42,160
Oh! Listen, the priests say that..

187
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:45,220
..the seven planets have
come together in charts.

188
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:47,561
There is danger that the whole
world will be destroyed.

189
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:50,158
Mother, have you called
these great men for that?

190
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:52,366
Son, you should not say such things.

191
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:54,297
The sacred fire is being carried
out in the whole country.

192
00:19:54,707 --> 00:19:56,174
Only these wise people
can save the world..

193
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:58,176
..from this evil planetary position.

194
00:19:58,244 --> 00:20:00,769
You are right, mother, you
are perfectly right.

195
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:02,507
Only these people have
been saving us and..

196
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:04,173
..only these people will save us.

197
00:20:04,316 --> 00:20:05,783
Dear, you must be tired
because of the journey.

198
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:07,318
Please go and take rest. Go.

199
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:12,453
Did you meet your mother?
How is she?

200
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:14,516
Daddy! Mother is perfectly
all right.

201
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:17,195
She is the convener
of the sacred fire.

202
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:20,388
But daddy, so much unnecessary
expenditure?

203
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:24,191
All the sweets and lavish dishes?

204
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:28,603
Son, your mother has begun
this donation spree.

205
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:33,211
To tell the truth, your marriage
could have been organised..

206
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,612
..at half the value of the
expenditure being carried out here.

207
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:41,476
You could have used the rest of
the money for your honeymoon.

208
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:46,218
No, sir, this is your mistake.
l, Giridahrilal, am still alive.

209
00:20:46,492 --> 00:20:52,431
Madam had ordered that 50 tins
of butter be used in the fire.

210
00:20:53,432 --> 00:21:00,497
l used only 5 tins of quality butter
and added some cheap butter to it.

211
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:04,505
She thinks it is all home
made quality butter.

212
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:13,179
Great, Giridharilal. l never
thought you are capable of this.

213
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:15,243
Good! Very good!

214
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:18,181
l'm not worthy of so much praise.

215
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:21,652
All the time l think for
the good of this family.

216
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:24,195
After all this is like my own house.

217
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:26,254
Why not? This is your house.

218
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:27,590
Brother!

219
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:32,395
Sheela!

220
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:36,405
l said to you to take me with you
to Nainital. But you didn't.

221
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:39,273
l'm happy that you are called
back by sending a telegram.

222
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:40,539
l'll definitely take you
there, the next time.

223
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:43,207
O God! What have you done? These
sweet balls were for..

224
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:46,410
..those sacred priests.
You have touched them!

225
00:21:46,485 --> 00:21:48,612
So what? The time of
untouchables is over.

226
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:51,212
lf mother had seen this, both of
us could have been in trouble.

227
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,817
Did mother see it? She didn't,
right? Shall l take one more?

228
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:57,825
You didn't ever take anything
from your sister? Just one?

229
00:21:58,297 --> 00:22:01,562
Here! Take these two. One yours
and the other on my behalf.

230
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:07,837
Greetings, madam.

231
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:09,373
Greetings. - Greetings, sir!

232
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:10,701
Please sit down, Mr. Giridharilal.

233
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,574
Tell me, what brings you here
so early in the morning?

234
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:16,238
Tulja, bring one more cup.

235
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:19,176
l need your signature
on the papers..

236
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:21,845
..of the tender of the
government contract.

237
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:26,188
But Mr. Giridharilal, as long
as the inauspicious time..

238
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:29,591
..is not over, a new job cannot
be started. Ask your madam.

239
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:33,194
The new job can be started. Because
of the worship by the..

240
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:36,598
..priests the influence of bad
planetary position is averted.

241
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:39,463
Or God only knows what
would have happened.

242
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:42,268
You are very right, madam. God
knows what would have happened.

243
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,203
You are really great. Because
of the sacred fire..

244
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:48,542
..the bad planetary influence
is averted, great.

245
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:55,411
You are great, Mr. Giridharilal.
You too believe such things?

246
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:59,423
l.. l..
- Yes? Say it. Say yes.

247
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,354
Don't you believe in
planetary influence?

248
00:23:02,227 --> 00:23:07,164
l don't believe? How dare l say?

249
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:13,696
Madam, sir, l'm your servant.
Both of you are my masters.

250
00:23:13,906 --> 00:23:15,840
How can the servant say anything?

251
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:22,370
lt means you believe in loyalty.
Towards me or towards her!

252
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:26,174
All right. Give me. Which
papers need my signature?

253
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:30,848
Here's the pen. Here.

254
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:35,891
You should read it. You signed
without reading it.

255
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:38,458
l need not worry when you are there.

256
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,521
Whatever you have written
must be correct.

257
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:42,197
Should l sign this cheque too?

258
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:44,525
l've to pay the cement supplier.

259
00:23:44,603 --> 00:23:46,195
But l've not yet checked the amount.

260
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:47,669
Should l fill the amount?

261
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,540
What are you saying? l'll put my
signature, you fill the amount later.

262
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:56,411
Thank you, sir. You have to attend
the meeting of contractors.

263
00:23:56,482 --> 00:23:58,473
Good that you reminded me.
l'd almost forgotten.

264
00:23:59,284 --> 00:24:00,273
Take it.

265
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:03,347
Mother, the bad planetary
position is over.

266
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:04,548
May l go to the school now?

267
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:05,681
Yes, go dear.

268
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:07,819
Come. Dear.

269
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:14,364
This useless woman sneezes
only when my son goes out.

270
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:16,360
Go. Sit down.

271
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,828
Gappu, sit here for
a couple of minutes.

272
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:21,566
Don't go to school until
there is second sneeze.

273
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:27,576
Gappu, aren't
you going to the school?

274
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:28,704
Come, l'll drop you there.

275
00:24:29,248 --> 00:24:31,375
Champa has sneezed.
So the road is closed.

276
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:34,245
Be ready for second sneeze.

277
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:42,391
Come on. The second
sneeze came. Let's go.

278
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:49,325
Madam, take it from me
that Sheela's wedding is fixed.

279
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:53,862
Now someone must come to
help you in this house.

280
00:24:54,673 --> 00:24:58,609
You are right. l too think that
Madan's marriage is getting delayed.

281
00:24:58,944 --> 00:25:00,206
Madan's marriage is getting
delayed? Don't worry.

282
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:04,742
Giridharilal is still alive.
He can get married soon.

283
00:25:05,284 --> 00:25:09,414
l've already seen a lovely
girl for him that..

284
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:13,686
..if you meet her today, you'll
want the wedding tomorrow.

285
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:19,630
That's good news. l think, you
take so much care of my family.

286
00:25:20,232 --> 00:25:23,167
O God! l was so busy thinking
about this family..

287
00:25:23,235 --> 00:25:25,499
..that l forgot my
own family matter.

288
00:25:25,838 --> 00:25:28,830
Madam, today evening l'll
have to go to the airport.

289
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:32,176
You know; my niece Rekha
is coming from America.

290
00:25:32,778 --> 00:25:34,245
ls Rekha coming?
- Yes.

291
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:37,376
lt's very auspicious. She
must be grown up now?

292
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:39,710
Excuse me, she must be young woman.

293
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:42,845
She is marriage age now.
She was my small doll.

294
00:25:43,322 --> 00:25:45,256
The time travels so fast, madam.

295
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:46,382
That's true.

296
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:48,588
You must be commended,
Mr. Giridharilal.

297
00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:53,595
Rekha's parents have passed
away. You raised her.

298
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:56,393
Now Rekha will serve
you at your old age.

299
00:25:56,468 --> 00:26:00,404
No, madam, for me the happiest
day will be when..

300
00:26:00,472 --> 00:26:04,670
..l'll see Rekha serving
her mother-in-law.

301
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:22,757
Listen, dear. l want to talk to
you about something important.

302
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:24,159
Yes?!

303
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:34,237
Why are you quiet, uncle?

304
00:26:34,306 --> 00:26:36,171
l can say something only
if you stop your parade.

305
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,504
Yes, uncle, tell me.

306
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:42,178
Listen dear, Madan is handsome..

307
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:45,705
..educated and a thorough gentleman.

308
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:48,185
lt's been my dream that you get..

309
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:50,847
..married to him
since you were a child.

310
00:26:55,594 --> 00:27:01,726
Oh! l like Madan. Uncle,
sometimes you talk sense.

311
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:06,795
And l want you too to pay attention
to sensible matters.

312
00:27:07,472 --> 00:27:10,202
l'll try, uncle. l'll try my best.

313
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:16,206
Dear Rekha, if you marry Madan,
you can have control over him.

314
00:27:16,682 --> 00:27:18,547
You'll rule that family.

315
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:22,281
You must understand that his
mother is orthodox woman.

316
00:27:22,688 --> 00:27:27,216
You'll have to give up foreign
fashion to keep her happy.

317
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:32,696
What a nice idea! Do you want me
not to read the poetry by Keats?

318
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:36,166
Should l read instead Saint
Tulsida's poems to Madan's mother?

319
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:39,635
Should l throw away the
Shakespeare Drama's?

320
00:27:40,305 --> 00:27:42,637
And should l begin to sing prayers
with Madan's mother?

321
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:46,371
l don't like it. l don't
like it at all.

322
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:49,437
Then l must warn you, you will
never get married to Madan.

323
00:27:49,848 --> 00:27:53,375
l will see how Madan will
not get married to me?

324
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:31,280
Why?

325
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:33,221
Speak at a low voice or
my fish will run away.

326
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:36,220
Why? lf l talk, the
fish will not come?

327
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:40,428
So, will the fish arrive to listen
to lovely tune you are singing?

328
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,563
You are flattering me because you
want me to praise your poetry.

329
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:46,831
You need not praise my poetry.
You like it much.

330
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:48,831
Because right now you
were singing the same.

331
00:28:49,775 --> 00:28:51,834
Your voice is as lovely as you are.

332
00:28:52,577 --> 00:28:56,445
l felt as if l heard a lovely
melody of a temple bell.

333
00:28:59,785 --> 00:29:02,117
All right. You remember
your poetry, l'll go.

334
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:14,257
Though you'll go, your
shadow will remain.

335
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:23,266
Though you'll go, your
shadow will remain.

336
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:32,217
Some shine of the beauty
will surely remain.

337
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:36,345
Some shine of the beauty.

338
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:52,364
You have met me at
this lovely pond.

339
00:29:52,771 --> 00:30:00,837
Whenever l see it,
l'll see you here.

340
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:09,581
This memory will never
go nor will this view.

341
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:18,321
Though you go away, you'll
come back here.

342
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:27,395
Though you'll go, your
shadow will remain.

343
00:30:28,206 --> 00:30:36,477
Some shine of the beauty
will surely remain.

344
00:30:36,882 --> 00:30:40,477
Some shine of the beauty.

345
00:30:50,295 --> 00:30:58,703
The fragrance of the body
will spread in the air.

346
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:06,572
Your hair will have
its impression here.

347
00:31:07,712 --> 00:31:16,177
The flowers will take away
the freshness of your lips.

348
00:31:16,588 --> 00:31:24,188
The imprint of your beauty
will always remain here.'

349
00:31:25,263 --> 00:31:33,602
Though you'll go, your
shadow will remain.

350
00:31:34,272 --> 00:31:42,611
Some shine of the beauty
will surely remain.

351
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:46,611
Some shine of the beauty.

352
00:31:54,292 --> 00:32:02,290
ln this pulsating
lovely landscape.'

353
00:32:04,636 --> 00:32:13,169
ln this pulsating
lovely landscape.'

354
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:21,509
Don't think you are just
a saga of a short time'

355
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:30,457
Now you'll be with me
always like my luck.

356
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:38,529
'You are the part of the
luck of this scenery.

357
00:32:39,604 --> 00:32:47,602
Though you'll go, your
shadow will remain.

358
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:56,615
Some shine of the beauty
will surely remain.

359
00:32:57,422 --> 00:33:05,557
Some shine of the beauty.

360
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:16,204
Madam, someone has
arrived to meet you.

361
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:17,533
Ok, l'll come soon.

362
00:33:18,343 --> 00:33:20,243
l had sent a telegram to Madan.

363
00:33:20,345 --> 00:33:21,676
Perhaps he has come to meet me.

364
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,908
Go, dear, go soon, l'll
come in a short while.

365
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:31,622
Geeta!
- Madan!

366
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:38,919
Did you receive my telegram?
- Yes, l did.

367
00:33:39,364 --> 00:33:40,422
After quite a long time.

368
00:33:40,699 --> 00:33:42,929
l was anxious without you.
You won't understand it.

369
00:33:43,368 --> 00:33:44,801
Huh! Don't you say so!

370
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:49,539
Tell me, how's your mother?
How is she?..

371
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:51,632
Strange! She called
me unnecessarily.

372
00:33:52,277 --> 00:33:54,245
l was so unhappy to
be away from you.

373
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:55,778
First it's mother, and
only then it's me.

374
00:33:56,715 --> 00:33:57,841
Shall l introduce you to my mother?

375
00:33:57,949 --> 00:33:59,883
Yes, sure. l'm here to meet her.

376
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:02,584
Mother! Mother!

377
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,388
Mother, he is Madan.

378
00:34:09,494 --> 00:34:10,552
Greetings, mother!

379
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:11,720
Bless you!

380
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,888
Please sit down.

381
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:17,896
Madan, Geeta always praises you.

382
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:21,696
She praises me because she
wants me to praise her.

383
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:22,898
Perhaps you are right, dear.

384
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:25,199
lsn't it, right? Ask her!

385
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:29,210
l only praised you in front of
mother; shall l malign you a bit?

386
00:34:29,314 --> 00:34:32,181
No dear, after meeting him, l think
Madan is not just gentleman..

387
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,308
..but a thorough gentleman.

388
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:35,285
Mother, you don't know what he did..

389
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:37,287
Enough! Please carry on.
l'll send some tea.

390
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:43,217
Let her come back, l'll tell
her about all you gimmick.

391
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,762
Please don't do it. l'll lose
all the impression l made.

392
00:34:45,864 --> 00:34:46,922
l'll surely tell.

393
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:48,757
Will you?

394
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:49,925
l'll. Surely l'll.

395
00:34:50,602 --> 00:34:52,934
'You are angry at my love.'

396
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:55,397
'l'm in love with your anger.'

397
00:34:55,774 --> 00:34:57,401
So you are subdued now?

398
00:34:57,575 --> 00:35:00,339
'Even the greats have to
bow down before love.'

399
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:02,439
'You look so beautiful.'

400
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:03,705
Mother!

401
00:35:07,652 --> 00:35:10,712
l've already read this book.
You had given it to me.

402
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:24,692
Okay, Geeta. Tomorrow 7 o'clock
at Central Library.'

403
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:27,364
Shall l go?
- Ok.

404
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:31,832
Greetings, madam!
- Greetings!

405
00:35:32,177 --> 00:35:33,542
Touch her feet!

406
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:34,906
Dear, Rekha!

407
00:35:36,448 --> 00:35:37,745
Madam, you recognised
her immediately.

408
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:39,373
Bless you!

409
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:42,685
How beautiful! How lovely she is.

410
00:35:42,787 --> 00:35:44,254
Please sit down, dear.

411
00:35:46,524 --> 00:35:48,492
She looks so lovely in a sari.

412
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,559
The foreign returned girls
wear boy's clothes.

413
00:35:52,864 --> 00:35:55,924
That's true. But as you have
seen my Rekha hasn't changed.

414
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:58,929
Mother, shall l take Rekha to daddy?

415
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:00,404
Yes, you can take her.

416
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:02,502
l'll prepare tea. l'll be back.

417
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:08,337
Daddy! Do you recognise her?

418
00:36:10,815 --> 00:36:13,579
No?! She is Rekha.

419
00:36:14,486 --> 00:36:15,783
Oh, Rekha.

420
00:36:16,187 --> 00:36:17,245
Greetings, uncle!

421
00:36:17,655 --> 00:36:20,715
Greetings, madam! Good morning!

422
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:22,759
Uncle! Please don't make fun of me.

423
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:29,460
lt's wonderful, Sheela. Look,
Rekha grew up so tall.

424
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:33,194
Dear, come here. Sit down.

425
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,209
My daughter looks like a moon.

426
00:36:38,443 --> 00:36:39,671
Yes, the full moon.

427
00:36:39,777 --> 00:36:43,440
Yes. Rekha, did you
meet Sheela's mother?

428
00:36:43,581 --> 00:36:44,639
Yes, uncle.

429
00:36:44,782 --> 00:36:47,910
Ok. Now tell me, you must have
liked America very much?

430
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:50,444
Oh, it's a wonderful country, uncle.

431
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:54,456
Swimming pools. Picnic spots.
Hotels, clubs.

432
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:57,920
Ballet dancing, rock-n-roll
and Cha-cha-cha.

433
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,327
Look! Your uncle is here.

434
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:02,731
Giridharilal is at your service.

435
00:37:03,268 --> 00:37:04,530
l like Rekha very much.

436
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:08,762
She is still innocent even after
coming back from America.

437
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,198
As she was earlier.

438
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:11,874
Uncle! Please sit down.

439
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:16,136
As soon as Rekha came
back from America..

440
00:37:16,214 --> 00:37:19,445
..l asked her to begin wearing
the lndian clothing.

441
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:21,246
And she readily agreed.

442
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:24,320
But she is disturbed
because of the sari.

443
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:26,151
She must have wore foreign
clothing there..

444
00:37:26,224 --> 00:37:27,748
..so she is not used
to wearing a sari.

445
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:28,883
You are right.

446
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,151
Look dear, if the head
is covered, that's ok..

447
00:37:31,229 --> 00:37:32,890
..and if it isn't, there no problem.

448
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:35,164
lf you keep on pulling up the sari..

449
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:37,895
..you'll look more American
than lndian.

450
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,161
Master, the building that is
being built in Old Delhi..

451
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:43,537
..we need cement permit for it.

452
00:37:43,841 --> 00:37:47,242
Rekha, let uncle talk about
business. We'll go.

453
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:48,903
Yes, dear, go.

454
00:37:52,784 --> 00:37:56,185
Sheela, don't you have
decent ball rooms..

455
00:37:56,254 --> 00:37:58,449
..good swimming pools,
or clubs in Delhi?

456
00:37:58,623 --> 00:38:00,488
You must be going to the clubs?

457
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:03,821
l just go to college
and come back home.

458
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:05,624
But brother must be going.

459
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,663
Yes, indeed! Madan must
be aware about them.

460
00:38:10,134 --> 00:38:11,192
Please come, madam.

461
00:38:15,206 --> 00:38:16,366
What do you think of Rekha?

462
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:18,236
l liked her very much?
What about you?

463
00:38:18,476 --> 00:38:21,536
l too like her. Let's
see if Madan likes her.

464
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,778
Rekha! Please, come here.

465
00:38:31,322 --> 00:38:32,880
No, Sheela, l'll prepare it.

466
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:40,889
Mr. Giridharilal.
- Yes, master.

467
00:38:41,232 --> 00:38:43,166
Rekha was shorter than the
tea trolley before..

468
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:45,566
..but today she is preparing tea.

469
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:49,230
Welcome, Madan. Come!

470
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:52,708
Hello, Madan.
- Hello!

471
00:38:54,512 --> 00:38:58,312
l'm Rekha!
- No! Good God!

472
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,808
Hello, madam!
- Ouch!

473
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:03,414
Mother, look, Madan hit me so hard.

474
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:05,449
My bone must have cracked.

475
00:39:08,693 --> 00:39:11,423
Even in childhood, both of
you used to hit each other.

476
00:39:11,729 --> 00:39:14,129
Madan, now you should
not hit my dear Rekha.

477
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:17,861
Mother, she is good at getting
beaten. She is just being phoney.

478
00:39:18,136 --> 00:39:20,127
When the girls come back from
foreign soil, they become..

479
00:39:20,204 --> 00:39:22,138
..delicate like a glass. Just
touch them and they get broken.

480
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:50,896
Madan!
- Which Madan?

481
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:53,369
l was talking to you
about him just now.

482
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:55,462
ls she Geeta?
- No.

483
00:39:55,573 --> 00:39:56,631
Then who is that woman?

484
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:57,766
l don't know.

485
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,843
lt seems your mood.. No! Let's go.

486
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:26,597
What are you thinking about, Madan?

487
00:40:26,704 --> 00:40:28,399
Huh.. nothing.

488
00:40:29,373 --> 00:40:31,307
You are so close but
you seem far away.

489
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:27,446
l am sorry for coming late!

490
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:30,611
You are not late.
l don't understand.

491
00:43:30,721 --> 00:43:31,779
Central Library!

492
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:34,286
Oh! l forgot!

493
00:43:34,558 --> 00:43:37,220
You had gone to the library?
- Yes!

494
00:43:37,795 --> 00:43:40,628
But tomorrow l am going
to the hair stylist.

495
00:43:40,798 --> 00:43:44,791
l will cut my hair short
and give it a new style.

496
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:46,198
Wearing 'Salwar Kameez' (lndian
traditional dress)..

497
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,669
..and saris is now old fashion.

498
00:43:47,805 --> 00:43:51,241
From tomorrow l will wear
skirt jacket and slacks.

499
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:52,808
Then you will take me to the club?

500
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,268
Stop it, Geeta!

501
00:43:54,378 --> 00:43:56,312
That girl has been visiting
our house since childhood.

502
00:43:56,414 --> 00:43:58,211
When l was coming to meet
you after getting ready..

503
00:43:58,282 --> 00:44:00,648
..father said take
Rekha to the club.

504
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:02,343
What could l have done?
l was helpless.

505
00:44:02,486 --> 00:44:04,386
ln the club you were
holding her hands.

506
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:05,546
That too was your helplessness?

507
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:06,884
Don't misunderstand me, Geeta!

508
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:09,657
There is nobody in my
life besides you!

509
00:44:10,227 --> 00:44:11,524
l want to marry you!

510
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:15,155
Marriage? How can l say? Ask mother!

511
00:44:15,566 --> 00:44:16,624
Geeta!

512
00:44:17,902 --> 00:44:19,233
Congratulations, Mr. Rai!

513
00:44:20,204 --> 00:44:22,172
Gandhi Memorial Hospital's
land case..

514
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:25,367
..with the landlord..
we have won that case.

515
00:44:26,711 --> 00:44:28,906
Congratulations to you and
not me, Mr. Girdharilal!

516
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,580
lt's all the outcome
of your services.

517
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:35,808
Sir, Girdharilal has taken
birth to serve this family!

518
00:44:36,187 --> 00:44:37,245
Have a seat!

519
00:44:43,194 --> 00:44:47,255
Mr. Girdharilal! You are
a valuable man for me!

520
00:44:47,598 --> 00:44:51,591
Sir, this hospital contract
is a major contract.

521
00:44:51,802 --> 00:44:55,932
Around 20000-25000 cement sacks
will be required for this building!

522
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:00,434
And sir, do you know?

523
00:45:00,644 --> 00:45:03,135
Right now there is deficiency
of cement in the market!

524
00:45:03,314 --> 00:45:04,508
Goods are not easily available.

525
00:45:04,615 --> 00:45:07,743
We have permit of 50,000
cement sacks.

526
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,719
What are you trying to say?

527
00:45:11,155 --> 00:45:15,649
Mr. Rai, right now people are
ready to pay any price for it.

528
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,352
You can quote any price.

529
00:45:17,795 --> 00:45:20,161
lf we sell half of our quota..
then the remaining half..

530
00:45:20,231 --> 00:45:22,597
..is enough for the hospital.

531
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:25,168
lf there is a dearth then we have..

532
00:45:25,236 --> 00:45:28,262
..enough material to
manufacture cement!

533
00:45:28,506 --> 00:45:30,906
The sellers will get the cement.

534
00:45:31,175 --> 00:45:32,802
And people will get the hospital.

535
00:45:33,177 --> 00:45:35,611
And we will get 1 .5-2 lakhs.

536
00:45:45,523 --> 00:45:46,785
Let it be there.

537
00:45:51,395 --> 00:45:53,727
For how long have you
been working for me?

538
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:57,360
Around 12 years!

539
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:00,530
ln 12 years a stranger
becomes a kin.

540
00:46:01,572 --> 00:46:04,871
ln these 12 years l considered
you as a family member.

541
00:46:05,876 --> 00:46:08,709
l considered you as my friend!

542
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:14,650
l considered you as my brother!

543
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:20,217
You are dear to me. You are
my friend, my brother.

544
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:22,156
And today you have hurt my heart..

545
00:46:22,226 --> 00:46:24,251
..my conscience, my character!

546
00:46:24,495 --> 00:46:27,760
Sir, people do make mistakes.
Forgive me.

547
00:46:28,532 --> 00:46:33,731
Girdharilal, what l regret is
that you didn't recognise me.

548
00:46:34,905 --> 00:46:39,239
l have enough wealth. lt's
sufficient for me and my family!

549
00:46:40,177 --> 00:46:44,170
And if in the future
l become a pauper..

550
00:46:44,248 --> 00:46:48,617
..still l won't betray my nation,
my country, my conscience!

551
00:46:51,922 --> 00:46:56,518
l can sell cement and earn 2 lakhs!

552
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:03,298
A hospital can be built
from sand! Sand!

553
00:47:05,436 --> 00:47:10,135
Where our mothers, our children..

554
00:47:10,207 --> 00:47:16,339
..our sisters, our daughters will
stay sick and ill and the hospital..

555
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:25,821
Mr. Girdharilal! l should die
before thinking of this!

556
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,517
l should die!

557
00:47:29,793 --> 00:47:33,456
lt's not your mistake!
lt's my mistake!

558
00:47:34,498 --> 00:47:38,559
Maybe your expense is
more and income less.

559
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:44,534
How much salary do you
receive? How much?

560
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,603
Sir..
- l am asking you!

561
00:47:51,515 --> 00:47:52,573
1000 rupees!

562
00:47:52,917 --> 00:47:58,617
From today your salary
is 2000 rupees!

563
00:48:00,758 --> 00:48:04,717
lts okay, Girdharilal!
Forget what happened!

564
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:08,330
But it shouldn't happen again!

565
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,267
You are my friend!

566
00:48:12,303 --> 00:48:13,861
And you will
always remain my friend!

567
00:48:15,306 --> 00:48:20,767
Go! Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

568
00:48:52,343 --> 00:48:54,607
Madan always changes topic
when we talk of marriage!

569
00:48:55,179 --> 00:48:58,546
Did we get married
as per our wishes?

570
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,648
There are so many girls.
He can select any.

571
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:03,177
Call Madan!

572
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,612
Go and call your brother!

573
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,850
Today Madan will have
to choose a girl!

574
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:12,852
Come on, brother! Mother
is calling you! - Why?

575
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,625
You will have to take decision
of your marriage! - Marriage?

576
00:49:15,799 --> 00:49:18,233
Mother has so many snaps of girls.

577
00:49:18,402 --> 00:49:19,630
You just have to select one.

578
00:49:23,774 --> 00:49:24,832
Come on!

579
00:49:26,176 --> 00:49:27,234
Come, son!

580
00:49:29,213 --> 00:49:33,309
Look, Madan! Today no excuses!
Select a girl!

581
00:49:33,517 --> 00:49:35,883
Otherwise tell me whom
do you want to marry!

582
00:49:36,153 --> 00:49:37,211
Mother!

583
00:49:39,657 --> 00:49:41,420
Brother, see this girl!

584
00:49:41,725 --> 00:49:44,785
Sheela, is this a girl's photo
or a parachute's photo?

585
00:49:50,267 --> 00:49:52,360
Let me also see the snaps!

586
00:49:54,305 --> 00:49:55,704
Father, she is nice!

587
00:49:55,806 --> 00:50:01,676
Yes! Wow! Wow! Very pretty!
Really nice!

588
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,238
Show me!

589
00:50:04,315 --> 00:50:05,373
Madan's mother, see this!

590
00:50:06,917 --> 00:50:11,445
She is really so pretty!
Her eyes are mesmerizing.

591
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:16,558
Sister, l am lucky that
you liked my daughter.

592
00:50:16,927 --> 00:50:19,191
Now even if somebody weighs
Madan with gold..

593
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:23,757
..still l will get him
married only to Geeta.

594
00:50:23,867 --> 00:50:26,700
Thank you. We are ordinary people.

595
00:50:27,371 --> 00:50:29,635
But where have you hidden your gem?

596
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:31,866
l have come to your house
to ask for her hand.

597
00:50:32,209 --> 00:50:34,643
Sister, don't say that.
This house is yours.

598
00:50:34,745 --> 00:50:38,408
l will just call her. Geeta! Geeta!

599
00:50:40,384 --> 00:50:41,442
Come, dear!

600
00:50:42,219 --> 00:50:43,277
Hey!

601
00:50:51,862 --> 00:50:52,920
Come, dear.

602
00:50:56,567 --> 00:50:57,761
So pretty!

603
00:50:59,636 --> 00:51:04,767
l was calling her a gem. But
she is worth more than that.

604
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:07,735
Sister-in-law!

605
00:51:08,779 --> 00:51:11,714
My Gappu has spoken such
auspicious words!

606
00:51:12,516 --> 00:51:14,450
He called Geeta sister-in-law.

607
00:51:15,285 --> 00:51:16,912
Sister, congratulations.

608
00:51:17,521 --> 00:51:19,352
From today Geeta is my daughter.

609
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,295
l am really pleased to see Geeta.

610
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:27,690
Congratulations, sister!

611
00:51:28,332 --> 00:51:32,268
First you have sweets! Great!

612
00:51:32,469 --> 00:51:33,936
Today l am shocked!

613
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:38,605
As soon as Gappu saw the girl..
he said sister-in-law.

614
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,207
l told the girl's mother
that it's an..

615
00:51:41,278 --> 00:51:43,439
..auspicious sign for this occasion.

616
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:47,516
From today the girl is mine. Here.
You too have sweets.

617
00:51:47,618 --> 00:51:48,676
Congratulations to you for
the daughter-in-law.

618
00:51:48,786 --> 00:51:50,515
Congratulations to you too.

619
00:51:50,621 --> 00:51:52,714
Mother, give me sweets!
- Yes! Here!

620
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:55,518
Congratulations to you too for
your brother's wedding! Eat!

621
00:51:56,593 --> 00:51:58,652
Girdharilal is still alive.

622
00:51:58,829 --> 00:52:02,196
Tell me too why are you
congratulating each other?

623
00:52:02,533 --> 00:52:03,898
Come, Mr. Girdharilal! Come!

624
00:52:04,168 --> 00:52:05,226
Sit! Sit!

625
00:52:05,669 --> 00:52:07,660
You wanted Madan to get
married, didn't you?

626
00:52:07,771 --> 00:52:09,295
The marriage is fixed.
- ls that so?

627
00:52:09,406 --> 00:52:10,668
Congratulations to you too!

628
00:52:11,575 --> 00:52:14,373
Not one. l will eat two of it.

629
00:52:14,511 --> 00:52:17,207
Why only two? The tray is full.

630
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:20,608
Mr. Girdharilal!

631
00:52:20,717 --> 00:52:22,742
Now there should be
no delay in marriage.

632
00:52:23,487 --> 00:52:24,818
You will have to make
all the arrangements.

633
00:52:25,355 --> 00:52:28,381
Tell the priest to fix
an auspicious date.

634
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,722
Why is Girdharilal alive?
To serve this house!

635
00:52:32,396 --> 00:52:36,492
The bride is delicate like
a flower. Beautiful.

636
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,795
Just like a full moon.

637
00:52:39,903 --> 00:52:41,200
Mr. Girdharilal, she is so pretty..

638
00:52:41,271 --> 00:52:44,832
..that Madan decided to marry
her when he saw her snap.

639
00:52:45,876 --> 00:52:47,810
l am really happy!

640
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:50,607
Mr. Girdharilal, call the priest.

641
00:52:50,848 --> 00:52:52,713
He used to come everyday.
He has just not come today.

642
00:52:52,883 --> 00:52:54,942
l have even got the
girl's horoscope.

643
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:58,511
Yes, yes. The priest
will be here. Soon.

644
00:53:01,525 --> 00:53:03,584
Shobha, don't hit me.

645
00:53:03,694 --> 00:53:04,752
What are you doing?

646
00:53:04,828 --> 00:53:06,455
Don't you know that she is
delicate like a flower?

647
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:08,554
What to do? l am feeling
so affectionate.

648
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,171
As the marriage date
is approaching..

649
00:53:21,245 --> 00:53:23,475
..she is becoming prettier.

650
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,548
That is fine. But
why does it happen?

651
00:53:25,682 --> 00:53:27,673
lf it's a love marriage then
this is what happens.

652
00:53:27,784 --> 00:53:29,809
Geeta, how does it
feel to be in love?

653
00:53:30,587 --> 00:53:32,919
Heart aches.
- Heart aches.

654
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,215
And you like this pain.
- You like the pain.

655
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,588
What kind of pain is this?
l never felt it!

656
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:41,923
lt will happen. You have
still not met anybody.

657
00:53:42,366 --> 00:53:46,700
l do meet guys. They whistle
and sing filmy songs.

658
00:53:46,803 --> 00:53:47,929
And then they leave.

659
00:53:50,474 --> 00:53:51,941
Hari! Hari! Hari!

660
00:53:59,816 --> 00:54:00,874
Congratulations, aunt!

661
00:54:01,151 --> 00:54:02,743
Congratulations for Geeta's
marriage, aunt!

662
00:54:02,853 --> 00:54:05,720
Congratulations to you all!
God bless my Geeta!

663
00:54:05,822 --> 00:54:08,450
Just watch, aunt. Geeta
will rule that house!

664
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:09,719
May what you say come true!

665
00:54:09,826 --> 00:54:12,818
Forget that! Right now
give some sweets!

666
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:19,829
Somebody has come! - Somebody from
Madan's house must have come!

667
00:54:21,805 --> 00:54:23,534
Let's go, Geeta! Come on!

668
00:54:23,607 --> 00:54:24,665
Come on! Come on!

669
00:54:24,775 --> 00:54:26,174
Why are you feeling shy? Get up!

670
00:54:31,815 --> 00:54:33,282
Greetings.
- You?

671
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:35,683
l am Girdharilal!

672
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:38,379
l think you have come from
Mr. Rai's house! - Yes!

673
00:54:38,555 --> 00:54:39,783
Madan's mother has sent me!

674
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:42,586
Come! Come! Have a seat!
l am Geeta's mother!

675
00:54:44,328 --> 00:54:46,193
You have come to inform us about..

676
00:54:46,263 --> 00:54:47,355
..the wedding date, Mr.
Girdharilal, right?

677
00:54:47,564 --> 00:54:49,828
l am really pleased that
you have come! - Pleased?

678
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:55,661
Sister, people are so
helpless in this world!

679
00:54:56,573 --> 00:54:58,939
We can't control joy or sorrow!

680
00:54:59,543 --> 00:55:01,670
At times joy, at times sorrow.

681
00:55:01,778 --> 00:55:04,246
What are you saying?
ls everything fine?

682
00:55:04,715 --> 00:55:09,652
Sister, l am really sad.
Man has reached the moon.

683
00:55:09,753 --> 00:55:14,156
And we think it's our
duty to believe in..

684
00:55:14,224 --> 00:55:17,352
..black magic, planets, books!

685
00:55:17,728 --> 00:55:19,753
Mr. Girdharilal! What's the matter?

686
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:24,630
The thing is that..
madam is orthodox.

687
00:55:24,735 --> 00:55:25,793
What has happened?

688
00:55:27,304 --> 00:55:30,171
Priest saw your daughter's
horoscope and he said..

689
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:34,301
..the town where this girl goes,
that town will be destroyed.

690
00:55:34,745 --> 00:55:37,578
The house she enters, that
house will be destroyed.

691
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:39,306
Stop it, Mr. Girdharila! Stop it!

692
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:42,180
And the woman on whom this
girl's shadow befalls..

693
00:55:42,252 --> 00:55:43,685
..that woman will become barren.

694
00:55:43,787 --> 00:55:46,312
No, no! How is this possible?
My Geeta is not like this!

695
00:55:46,423 --> 00:55:48,687
The priest says this marriage
is not possible!

696
00:55:49,326 --> 00:55:50,588
Geeta is a Manglik!
- No!

697
00:55:50,861 --> 00:55:51,919
O My God!

698
00:56:06,843 --> 00:56:11,177
Mother! Why are you sad, mother?

699
00:56:12,182 --> 00:56:13,342
l am bound to be sad!

700
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:16,548
Your sorrow is my sorrow, Geeta!

701
00:56:16,653 --> 00:56:17,881
Look at me, mother!

702
00:56:18,689 --> 00:56:20,589
Accepting defeat is not
the sensible thing to do!

703
00:56:21,391 --> 00:56:25,418
Mother, forget everything!
Smile! Mother, smile!

704
00:56:26,697 --> 00:56:29,359
How can l smile, Geeta? How?

705
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:33,462
Smile once, mother! Otherwise
l will feel really sad!

706
00:56:36,206 --> 00:56:39,698
Fine! Fine, dear!

707
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,909
Mother! l think they have come!

708
00:56:45,215 --> 00:56:46,273
l will open the door!

709
00:56:46,516 --> 00:56:49,212
Now what, mother?
How can l face him?

710
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:50,784
l will talk to him!

711
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:54,248
Mother!

712
00:56:58,662 --> 00:57:00,493
Greetings, aunt!
- God bless you, dear!

713
00:57:00,697 --> 00:57:02,756
How are you?
- l am fine!

714
00:57:03,633 --> 00:57:06,329
Madan! Geeta is not at home!

715
00:57:06,603 --> 00:57:07,865
Geeta is not at home?

716
00:57:10,307 --> 00:57:11,535
Aunt, l will wait!

717
00:57:15,746 --> 00:57:19,341
But Madan, l think Geeta
won't return so soon.

718
00:57:19,683 --> 00:57:21,708
Okay, mother. l will leave.

719
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,753
But mother, what's the matter?
You look so sad.

720
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:27,654
Mother, forgive me.

721
00:57:31,328 --> 00:57:35,765
Mother said l am not at home.
lt's my mistake, Madan.

722
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:38,463
lts okay, Geeta. But
what's the matter?

723
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:42,729
Mother is so worried and you..
you are so sad and worried.

724
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,705
Did somebody from
my house come here?

725
00:57:45,308 --> 00:57:47,902
Do you know what the priest said..
- Yes, l know.

726
00:57:51,181 --> 00:57:53,479
So what? You are worried for this!

727
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:56,814
Geeta, the priest can't take
the decision of our lives!

728
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,379
Destiny can't change our intentions!

729
00:57:59,589 --> 00:58:03,616
Geeta, do you remember that season
of spring and that song?

730
00:58:04,261 --> 00:58:07,856
Yes. A woman can never forget
her first love, Madan!

731
00:58:08,131 --> 00:58:10,224
Fine! But why are you
talking like this!

732
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:16,166
Because l can never
forget those moments.

733
00:58:16,473 --> 00:58:17,531
Geeta!

734
00:58:18,408 --> 00:58:21,741
l used to think that
we will never part!

735
00:58:22,379 --> 00:58:25,746
But Madan, maybe we
will never unite.

736
00:58:25,882 --> 00:58:27,213
What are you saying, Geeta?

737
00:58:27,818 --> 00:58:30,582
Madan, don't get upset.
l am helpless.

738
00:58:31,288 --> 00:58:34,780
l am unfortunate. l
am destined for this.

739
00:58:34,891 --> 00:58:38,156
Geeta, l am sad that my love
couldn't even give you..

740
00:58:38,228 --> 00:58:40,594
..the strength to face the world!

741
00:58:41,331 --> 00:58:42,764
This deceitful and
treacherous world.

742
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:44,164
You forgot your love, your oaths..

743
00:58:44,234 --> 00:58:46,896
..and promises of faithfulness!

744
00:58:47,771 --> 00:58:50,262
l didn't forget anything.
l remember everything.

745
00:58:50,907 --> 00:58:53,273
You will always be
close to my heart.

746
00:58:53,777 --> 00:58:59,909
But l can't marry you. Forgive
me, Madan. Forgive me.

747
00:59:00,483 --> 00:59:01,848
lf possible then forget me.

748
00:59:18,134 --> 00:59:31,446
l have myself broken
the bond of my love.

749
00:59:33,817 --> 00:59:45,217
l have myself broken
the bond of my love.

750
00:59:47,764 --> 00:59:53,361
My loyalty had ruined.

751
00:59:53,536 --> 01:00:03,912
My loyalty had ruined all hopes.

752
01:00:17,193 --> 01:00:27,569
l have decided to forget you but.

753
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:40,206
l have decided to forget you but.

754
01:00:41,518 --> 01:00:46,478
Neither my heart nor l know.

755
01:00:46,556 --> 01:00:51,619
Neither my heart nor l know.

756
01:00:51,895 --> 01:00:57,231
How will l live after
forgetting you?

757
01:00:59,736 --> 01:01:10,374
l have myself broken
the bond of my love.

758
01:01:23,693 --> 01:01:28,790
lf we ever meet again.

759
01:01:28,932 --> 01:01:34,199
We will turn our back.

760
01:01:36,873 --> 01:01:41,936
lf we ever meet again.

761
01:01:42,212 --> 01:01:47,548
We will turn our back.

762
01:01:47,684 --> 01:01:52,951
lf l ever hear your name.

763
01:01:53,223 --> 01:01:58,286
lf l ever hear your name.

764
01:01:58,428 --> 01:02:03,456
Then l will keep quiet
with my head bowed.

765
01:02:06,169 --> 01:02:16,568
l have myself broken
the bond of my love.

766
01:02:21,718 --> 01:02:26,849
l don't want to think,
still l think.

767
01:02:26,923 --> 01:02:32,520
What will be left in my life?

768
01:02:34,898 --> 01:02:40,268
l don't want to think,
still l think.

769
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:45,601
What will be left in my life?

770
01:02:45,809 --> 01:02:50,872
Suppressing desires of having you.

771
01:02:51,281 --> 01:02:56,810
Going away from your thoughts.

772
01:02:58,922 --> 01:03:04,292
Suppressing desires of having you.

773
01:03:04,627 --> 01:03:09,655
Going away from your thoughts.

774
01:03:12,168 --> 01:03:22,772
l have myself broken
the bond of my love.

775
01:03:27,584 --> 01:03:28,642
What are you doing?

776
01:03:29,652 --> 01:03:32,246
l don't want to eat.
- Why?

777
01:03:33,656 --> 01:03:36,386
lf he doesn't want to eat, fine.
Why are you insisting?

778
01:03:36,726 --> 01:03:38,421
l don't like such children!

779
01:03:38,862 --> 01:03:40,261
lf he doesn't want to eat then
he should go to his room!

780
01:03:46,469 --> 01:03:47,527
And what are you doing?

781
01:03:49,205 --> 01:03:50,263
You too don't want to eat?

782
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:51,865
Then you too go!

783
01:03:59,749 --> 01:04:01,307
Otherwise they will
lose their self-respect.

784
01:04:01,885 --> 01:04:03,147
Are children like this?

785
01:04:03,486 --> 01:04:05,613
They get upset if their
wish is not fulfilled.

786
01:04:07,557 --> 01:04:09,582
You shouldn't be angry while eating.

787
01:04:13,763 --> 01:04:16,664
Gappu! You didn't eat dinner.
But why are you crying?

788
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:19,632
Why has brother not come?
- He will be here soon.

789
01:04:19,769 --> 01:04:21,896
He won't come!
- Don't say that!

790
01:04:25,175 --> 01:04:27,905
Sister, she was really nice!
- Who?

791
01:04:28,711 --> 01:04:29,769
Sister-in-law!

792
01:04:31,514 --> 01:04:33,778
Driver! Did you find Madan?
- No, sir!

793
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:36,514
We searched everywhere. But
l didn't find junior sir.

794
01:04:37,187 --> 01:04:39,655
Any other work for me?
- No, driver! You can go!

795
01:04:42,192 --> 01:04:43,250
l don't understand..

796
01:04:43,393 --> 01:04:44,451
Why don't you understand?

797
01:04:45,261 --> 01:04:47,593
We no longer control
the children at home!

798
01:04:48,665 --> 01:04:50,394
Everybody wants to
do as they please!

799
01:05:02,412 --> 01:05:04,676
Madan's mother!
- Yes!

800
01:05:09,385 --> 01:05:11,819
Can l say something?
- Yes!

801
01:05:20,763 --> 01:05:24,221
You can't change the direction
of the arrow shot.

802
01:05:25,435 --> 01:05:27,232
Children find their own way.

803
01:05:27,904 --> 01:05:29,565
Nobody can stop their way!

804
01:05:29,706 --> 01:05:31,367
Nobody can change their destination!

805
01:05:31,574 --> 01:05:34,304
But l can't bring that Manglik
girl in this house!

806
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:37,172
ls this your final decision?
- Yes!

807
01:05:41,718 --> 01:05:43,310
What will be the outcome?

808
01:05:44,254 --> 01:05:45,846
Do you know what will
be the outcome?

809
01:05:47,457 --> 01:05:52,520
l am afraid to say this.
My heart trembles.

810
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:00,328
'This lightening! This storm!'

811
01:06:00,737 --> 01:06:02,398
'God knows where he is!'

812
01:06:03,139 --> 01:06:05,539
'lf anything happened
to my Madan then..'

813
01:06:05,742 --> 01:06:07,334
No, no, no!

814
01:06:08,478 --> 01:06:10,412
lf anything happened
to my Madan then..

815
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,677
Don't say that! Don't say that!

816
01:06:12,882 --> 01:06:14,679
God willing my Madan
should be alive!

817
01:06:14,817 --> 01:06:16,478
That girl is Madan's life!

818
01:06:17,287 --> 01:06:19,551
lf Madan doesn't marry her
then he will kill himself!

819
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:21,823
Don't talk such inauspicious things!

820
01:06:22,158 --> 01:06:25,821
For God's sake! Don't say
that! No, no! No, no!

821
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:36,361
Hello! lt's me!

822
01:06:37,173 --> 01:06:39,835
What? Bad news?
- Bad news?

823
01:06:40,176 --> 01:06:41,234
Suicide!

824
01:06:41,311 --> 01:06:42,369
Who has committed suicide?

825
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,345
He is dead!
- Who is dead?

826
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:51,584
My heart is breaking! Tell me!
Tell me! Who is dead?

827
01:06:51,854 --> 01:06:52,912
Who is dead?

828
01:06:53,523 --> 01:06:56,356
Madan! My son Madan! My son!

829
01:06:56,859 --> 01:06:59,453
You have come! God saved you!

830
01:07:00,196 --> 01:07:03,529
Look, l am your mother! You
can do anything you want!

831
01:07:03,733 --> 01:07:06,725
l don't want anything!
l just want you to live, son!

832
01:07:06,803 --> 01:07:07,861
l just want you to live!
- Mother!

833
01:07:08,738 --> 01:07:13,732
Just now.. just now
l heard a bad news!

834
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:17,204
l have lost all my strength!

835
01:07:18,147 --> 01:07:19,614
You marry her!

836
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:24,745
Madan! Madan's mother! Look!
Now Madan has come!

837
01:07:25,154 --> 01:07:27,622
Why are you crying? Madan has come!

838
01:07:28,157 --> 01:07:31,820
Go and rest! Go! Go! Go!

839
01:07:37,166 --> 01:07:38,360
Where had you gone?

840
01:07:40,169 --> 01:07:41,227
Why have you come so late?

841
01:07:42,505 --> 01:07:45,497
You don't know what we went through!

842
01:07:45,908 --> 01:07:47,569
l am really worried, father!

843
01:07:48,344 --> 01:07:51,836
Son, you lost hope so soon?

844
01:07:53,182 --> 01:07:55,241
You will marry that girl!

845
01:07:56,519 --> 01:07:57,850
That time has passed, father.

846
01:07:58,187 --> 01:08:01,782
No! Time has not passed!
You will marry that girl!

847
01:08:03,726 --> 01:08:06,320
Go, son! Go and rest! Go!

848
01:08:22,745 --> 01:08:23,803
Are you Geeta?

849
01:08:24,147 --> 01:08:25,580
You?

850
01:08:26,749 --> 01:08:27,807
Madan is my son!

851
01:08:29,685 --> 01:08:30,743
Come!

852
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:35,548
Mother has gone to the temple!

853
01:08:35,758 --> 01:08:37,453
She will be here soon! Have a seat!

854
01:08:41,497 --> 01:08:45,524
Geeta! l am proud of your Madan!

855
01:08:46,702 --> 01:08:48,499
He chose a girl like you!

856
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:53,775
Like a Goddess you are virtuous,
pure and innocent!

857
01:08:55,178 --> 01:08:59,706
And l praise Madan for his choice.

858
01:09:00,383 --> 01:09:02,180
l have a daughter Sheela!

859
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:07,780
Seeing you l don't know why l
feel like calling you daughter.

860
01:09:08,658 --> 01:09:09,716
Father.

861
01:09:10,726 --> 01:09:14,389
Geeta.. shall l ask you something?
- Yes!

862
01:09:16,666 --> 01:09:19,658
Why are you betraying yourself?

863
01:09:20,736 --> 01:09:22,203
Why are you being hard on yourself?

864
01:09:23,806 --> 01:09:24,864
For his happiness!

865
01:09:26,209 --> 01:09:29,372
l don't mind if my life is ruined.

866
01:09:30,146 --> 01:09:31,875
Life is very precious, Geeta.

867
01:09:33,216 --> 01:09:35,275
You don't have any right to ruin it.

868
01:09:36,352 --> 01:09:39,617
You think if you are ruined
then a person will flourish.

869
01:09:41,157 --> 01:09:44,217
You think somebody will
be happy in your sorrow.

870
01:09:45,228 --> 01:09:47,321
No, dear. This won't happen!

871
01:09:48,865 --> 01:09:52,232
Your destruction will
ruin this family!

872
01:09:53,169 --> 01:09:57,629
A father, a mother, a sister.

873
01:09:58,908 --> 01:10:01,570
An innocent brother's
heart will break.

874
01:10:03,446 --> 01:10:06,176
And its also possible
that Madan's mother..

875
01:10:06,249 --> 01:10:09,446
..will lose Madan forever!

876
01:10:09,852 --> 01:10:11,843
Don't say that! This
is not possible!

877
01:10:12,522 --> 01:10:15,457
What will happen! What can happen!
Forget all that, Geeta.

878
01:10:16,659 --> 01:10:21,255
Just tell me.. can you be happy
after taking this decision?

879
01:10:21,664 --> 01:10:22,722
Tell me, dear. Tell me!

880
01:10:23,466 --> 01:10:25,525
Can you be happy without Madan?

881
01:10:25,735 --> 01:10:27,202
No! No!

882
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:31,931
Only fortunate people are
destined for such love!

883
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:37,608
lt seems.. you both were
life partners before too!

884
01:10:39,582 --> 01:10:41,948
You both have taken
birth for each other.

885
01:10:43,486 --> 01:10:45,283
So why did you take this decision?

886
01:10:45,354 --> 01:10:46,616
Tell me! Why did you
take this decision?

887
01:10:49,225 --> 01:10:52,626
Fine. As you wish!

888
01:10:54,897 --> 01:10:57,764
l had come to you with high hopes.

889
01:10:59,435 --> 01:11:04,429
l thought you will surely do a
favour on an old man like me, dear.

890
01:11:06,909 --> 01:11:11,175
You will keep the honour
of an old man intact.

891
01:11:13,783 --> 01:11:17,412
Let it be. l will leave.

892
01:11:20,189 --> 01:11:23,249
l am old. l am sick.

893
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:30,427
l am on my deathbed.
l might die anytime.

894
01:11:30,633 --> 01:11:31,725
Don't say that, father.

895
01:11:33,936 --> 01:11:37,770
Father! You again called me father!

896
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:43,941
So promise me that you will
come to me when l am dying.

897
01:11:45,281 --> 01:11:50,651
lf you came then this dying old
man's soul will be in peace.

898
01:11:51,487 --> 01:11:52,545
Will you come?

899
01:11:53,222 --> 01:11:55,622
Don't say that, father!
Don't say that!

900
01:11:56,492 --> 01:11:59,290
l will do what you want!

901
01:12:00,363 --> 01:12:02,422
God bless you, dear! God bless you!

902
01:12:03,766 --> 01:12:04,824
God bless you!

903
01:12:09,639 --> 01:12:13,166
Hello, Rekha! You have
come after a long time!

904
01:12:13,909 --> 01:12:15,171
You look worried.

905
01:12:16,178 --> 01:12:17,236
Anything special?

906
01:12:18,381 --> 01:12:22,374
Not for you. But for
me it's special.

907
01:12:22,852 --> 01:12:23,910
l don't understand.

908
01:12:25,254 --> 01:12:27,586
That's the sorrow. You
didn't understand.

909
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,321
What are you saying, Rekha?

910
01:12:33,863 --> 01:12:36,195
You are getting married?
- Yes. l am getting married.

911

Congratulations.

912
01:12:39,335 --> 01:12:40,529
Thanks. But why are you crying?

913
01:12:42,838 --> 01:12:46,638
l will cry all my life!
l can never forget you!

914
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:49,268
Rekha!

915
01:13:12,435 --> 01:13:15,165

01:16:47,683 --> 01:16:50,481
No, no! Madan's heart will break!

962
01:16:50,853 --> 01:16:52,844
l told you that l won't participate
in this wedding!

963
01:16:53,589 --> 01:16:54,647

01:16:56,458 --> 01:17:00,189
Today l came to know that

01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:06,134
Today l came to know that you can..

966

Mother!

974
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:39,225

What has happened?
What has happened?

976
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:45,238
That Manglik girl has
come in this house!

977
01:17:48,177 --> 01:17:49,906
She stepped in the house
and Mr. Rai died!

978
01:17:50,179 --> 01:17:57,244
She is very ill-fated.
- Yes, right said.

979
01:19:05,254 --> 01:19:06,653
Gappu! Quickly drink your milk!

980
01:19:06,789 --> 01:19:07,847
Don't you want to go to school?

981
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:09,454
Yes, sister-in-law.
- Hurry up!

982
01:19:23,338 --> 01:19:24,396
Are you ready?

983
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:27,373
Yes, l am late. As father is
not there l am really busy.

984
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:30,838
And it feels as if we are
going away from each other.

985
01:19:33,549 --> 01:19:37,280
You shouldn't think like that.
l will always be with you!

986
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:38,878
Bye-bye!

987
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:45,718
Sister-in-law, l couldn't study
for the past 4 months.

988
01:19:45,861 --> 01:19:48,489

How is mother?

995
01:20:48,891 --> 01:20:51,553
She has not forgotten father's
death. Look after her.

996
01:20:52,227 --> 01:20:53,285
This is my duty.

997
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:55,491
Has Gappu gone to sleep?
- Yes.

998
01:20:56,298 --> 01:20:57,424
Has Sheela returned?

Please sit down.

1003
01:21:46,348 --> 01:21:47,747
Have you typed those tenders?
- Yes, sir.

1004
01:21:47,883 --> 01:21:48,941
May l see them?

1005
01:21:56,491 --> 01:21:57,549
Come, uncle. Hang on.

1006
01:21:58,293 --> 01:22:01,319
Yes. You can shift
on 1 7th July. Yes.

1007
01:22:02,164 --> 01:22:03,222
Thank you.

1008
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:05,224
Tell me, uncle.

1009
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,359
l need your signatures
on these papers.

1010
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:12,673
So many papers, uncle. And
cheques too are there.

1011
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:14,433
Very important cheques.

1012
01:22:14,576 --> 01:22:16,168
What's the hurry, uncle?

1013
01:22:16,478 --> 01:22:19,311
But l have to settle
trader's account.

1014
01:22:19,615 --> 01:22:20,912
l need the signature on
the cheques today itself.

1015
01:22:21,183 --> 01:22:22,912
Everybody in the market trusts us.

1016
01:22:23,485 --> 01:22:26,648
You are right, Madan. Trust
is very important.

1017
01:22:26,922 --> 01:22:30,255
lf people don't trust
God then God too..

1018
01:22:30,859 --> 01:22:33,521
l see! So you will
read and then sign.

1019
01:22:33,595 --> 01:22:34,653
Yes, uncle. Tomorrow.

1020
01:22:36,198 --> 01:22:39,395
Yes. Madan speaking. Yes. Yes.

1021
01:23:03,759 --> 01:23:06,159
Uncle.. what's the matter?

1022
01:23:07,496 --> 01:23:10,226
Good that you didn't marry
that foolish Madan.

1023
01:23:10,832 --> 01:23:12,424
Are you drunk, uncle?

1024
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,235
Yes, l am drunk.

1025
01:23:14,636 --> 01:23:17,434
ln 12 years Mr. Rai never
asked me for the accounts!

1026
01:23:17,773 --> 01:23:20,571
He signed the papers kept in front
of him without reading it.

1027
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:24,543
And this young Madan.. he says
l won't sign without reading.

1028
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:26,841
l considered him like my son.

1029
01:23:27,516 --> 01:23:29,381
And he thinks that l am dishonest.

1030
01:23:29,851 --> 01:23:31,182
Madan, whom till now you
called a decent guy..

1031
01:23:31,253 --> 01:23:34,780
..today you are calling
him insolent.

1032
01:23:35,524 --> 01:23:38,687
Why? Because he didn't marry me.

1033
01:23:39,628 --> 01:23:41,493
No, this is not so.

1034
01:23:42,397 --> 01:23:46,265
You are calling him insolent
because he didn't heed you.

1035
01:23:47,402 --> 01:23:48,596
You are not concerned for me.

1036
01:23:48,804 --> 01:23:51,329
You have always thought about
your benefit, uncle!

1037
01:23:51,873 --> 01:23:55,570
You told me.. be like
an lndian girl.

1038
01:23:55,911 --> 01:23:58,812
You should wear a sari. You should
cover your head with a veil.

1039
01:23:59,414 --> 01:24:00,540
You should greet people.

1040
01:24:00,749 --> 01:24:02,614
And you should touch Madan's
mother's feet.

1041
01:24:03,618 --> 01:24:06,883
l did all of this. But
l didn't marry Madan.

1042
01:24:07,723 --> 01:24:10,886
You are not sad. But l am! l am sad!

1043
01:24:11,293 --> 01:24:15,627
Rekha.. dear, your sorrow is mine.

1044
01:24:16,832 --> 01:24:18,891
Don't be sad. Don't be dejected.

1045
01:24:19,434 --> 01:24:24,633
This is Delhi. Here you
will find many rich guys.

1046
01:24:24,906 --> 01:24:29,400
Girdarilal is still alive. l will
get you married to a billionaire.

1047
01:24:30,178 --> 01:24:34,911
No, uncle. Don't do so many
favours. l don't want to marry.

1048
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:37,914
l won't marry! l won't marry!
l won't marry!

1049
01:24:43,191 --> 01:24:45,523
Sister-in-law, narrate
me the monkey story.

1050
01:24:46,528 --> 01:24:48,462
First your school studies
then the story.

1051
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:49,588
l memorised everything.

1052
01:24:49,664 --> 01:24:51,723
You memorised everything?
Fine. Listen.

1053
01:24:53,735 --> 01:24:56,260
Come, Mr. Girdarilal! Sit!

1054
01:24:57,205 --> 01:24:58,263
Tell me, how are you?

1055
01:24:58,407 --> 01:25:02,810
l am fine. l am alive. But life
is no longer the same, ma'am.

1056
01:25:03,145 --> 01:25:04,203
Why so?

1057
01:25:07,416 --> 01:25:11,284
Such a boss.. a nice friend..
is no more.

1058
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:14,311
So now who will respect Girdarilal?

1059
01:25:14,556 --> 01:25:15,750
What happened?

1060
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:20,492
Yes, in a jungle there
was a ferocious lion.

1061
01:25:20,829 --> 01:25:23,229
That lion was so hot tempered that..

1062
01:25:23,298 --> 01:25:26,165
..the other lions
were afraid of him.

1063
01:25:26,368 --> 01:25:29,235
They would bow down their
head and greet him.

1064
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:31,639
Got it?
- Yes, sister-in-law. l understood.

1065
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:35,833
And in that jungle a
smart monkey lived.

1066
01:25:36,578 --> 01:25:37,636
Very fashionable.

1067
01:25:37,779 --> 01:25:43,240
He would wear a suit and
a tie and grandly smoke.

1068
01:25:43,518 --> 01:25:45,383
Sister-in-law, the monkey
used to smoke?

1069
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,578
Yes, why not?

1070
01:25:46,721 --> 01:25:48,780
Do you think l am a kid
and you are fooling me?

1071
01:25:48,924 --> 01:25:50,255
This is a fictional monkey.

1072
01:25:50,392 --> 01:25:52,724
But the monkeys in the
zoo don't smoke.

1073
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:55,728
The fictional monkey smokes.
Now l won't narrate it.

1074
01:25:56,264 --> 01:25:58,596
Madan said l won't
sign on the papers?

1075
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:00,190
Yes, ma'am.

1076
01:26:00,735 --> 01:26:03,727
He shouldn't have said that.
l will ask him.

1077
01:26:04,339 --> 01:26:05,670
He is making a mistake.

1078
01:26:06,675 --> 01:26:10,475
lt's not his mistake. You can
understand who teaches him..

1079
01:26:10,712 --> 01:26:14,478
l understood. l understand
everything, Mr. Girdarilal!

1080
01:26:14,549 --> 01:26:15,607
l understand everything!

1081
01:26:15,884 --> 01:26:17,146
The lion shouted!

1082
01:26:19,221 --> 01:26:22,156
The lion ran after the monkey.
The monkey ran away.

1083
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:23,484
He jumped on the tree.

1084
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:26,651
The lion shouted, come
down. Come down.

1085
01:26:27,696 --> 01:26:29,687
Gappu! Gappu!

1086
01:26:29,831 --> 01:26:31,890
Gappu, get up. Gappu, get up.

1087
01:26:33,502 --> 01:26:35,663
Show me! What happened,
sister-in-law?

1088
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:37,398
Wait, l will get the medicine.

1089
01:26:37,706 --> 01:26:38,764
Don't cry, Gappu.

1090
01:26:38,907 --> 01:26:41,171
lf mother found out then she
won't spare sister-in-law.

1091
01:26:41,309 --> 01:26:43,174
l won't cry. l won't cry.

1092
01:26:44,279 --> 01:26:45,906
lt's a minor wound. lt will
get cured by tomorrow.

1093
01:26:46,681 --> 01:26:48,512
l know why this happened.

1094
01:26:51,586 --> 01:26:53,383
Hari! Hari! Hari!

1095
01:26:53,522 --> 01:26:55,251
Thank God you arrived, priest!

1096
01:26:55,490 --> 01:26:56,855
Mr. Girdarilal told me!

1097
01:26:56,925 --> 01:26:59,450
Nobody besides Mr. Girdarilal
is concerned about this family!

1098
01:27:01,396 --> 01:27:04,194
Ma'am, l think somebody has
cast an evil eye on Gappu.

1099
01:27:04,332 --> 01:27:05,526
This is what even l thought.

1100
01:27:06,468 --> 01:27:07,867
She cast an evil eye on my child!

1101
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:09,528
l will just ward off the evil eye!

1102
01:27:09,671 --> 01:27:11,536
But nobody besides you
should stay here.

1103
01:27:12,207 --> 01:27:13,640
Leave! Go! Leave!

1104
01:27:16,811 --> 01:27:18,506
You understood who has
cast an evil eye.

1105
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,671
She is the only unlucky
person in this house.

1106
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:29,448
Geeta!

1107
01:27:31,793 --> 01:27:34,193
You have to endure so many sorrows
because of me, Geeta.

1108
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:38,897
You are mine, what can
give me more happiness?

1109
01:27:39,434 --> 01:27:40,492
Geeta!

1110
01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:45,037
lf you have love then you can face
all the sorrows in the world!

1111
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,402
Geeta, you know that mother..

1112
01:27:46,474 --> 01:27:50,376
Don't complain about mother!
She is my mother! - Geeta!

1113
01:27:54,482 --> 01:27:56,814
Doctor! He had high fever at night.

1114
01:27:57,953 --> 01:27:59,921
Doctor, no need to give medicines.

1115
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:02,216
My Gappu is now fine.
Here is offering.

1116
01:28:02,490 --> 01:28:03,957
lt's because of my injection.

1117
01:28:04,025 --> 01:28:06,823
Not injection, priest's
mantras are potent.

1118
01:28:06,962 --> 01:28:09,522
Yes, ma'am. Nowadays injections
are just fashionable thing.

1119
01:28:10,498 --> 01:28:11,556
Fashionable thing.

1120
01:28:13,201 --> 01:28:15,260
Gappu, have some offering.

1121
01:28:15,937 --> 01:28:18,838
Priest chanted the mantra
and you got well.

1122
01:28:24,245 --> 01:28:26,008
Madan!
- Yes, mother!

1123
01:28:28,316 --> 01:28:29,908
Earlier you would come without
having to call you.

1124
01:28:30,285 --> 01:28:33,482
Now l have to call you. You
are changing day by day.

1125
01:28:33,855 --> 01:28:36,790
No, mother. This is not so.
There is so much work load.

1126
01:28:37,192 --> 01:28:38,784
You know that your father
used to consider..

1127
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:40,418
..Mr. Girdharilal as his friend.

1128
01:28:40,495 --> 01:28:42,122
Yes, mother. What's the matter?

1129
01:28:42,430 --> 01:28:43,954
He has many complains from you.

1130
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:46,262
Complains from me? Why?

1131
01:28:46,835 --> 01:28:48,393
Why didn't you sign on his papers?

1132
01:28:48,536 --> 01:28:51,232
Oh! Mother, that day l
was really busy and..

1133
01:28:51,306 --> 01:28:52,364
..l had not read the papers.

1134
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,498
How could l have signed
without reading it?

1135
01:28:53,808 --> 01:28:55,969
lf he has any complains
then l will apologise.

1136
01:28:56,344 --> 01:28:58,278
Yes, son. Do apologise to him.

1137
01:28:58,813 --> 01:29:00,872
Mother, shall l leave?
- God bless you, son.

1138
01:29:03,818 --> 01:29:05,479
Amit! Has uncle come to the office?

1139
01:29:06,888 --> 01:29:08,480
Come, uncle. You have a long life.

1140
01:29:08,556 --> 01:29:10,956
l was just thinking about
you. Have a seat.

1141
01:29:11,026 --> 01:29:12,823
Why? Anything special?

1142
01:29:13,828 --> 01:29:16,296
Yes. That day you were mistaken.

1143
01:29:17,032 --> 01:29:20,832
l regret that l hurt
you. Forgive me.

1144
01:29:21,069 --> 01:29:24,766
You have hurt me? Why
are you apologising?

1145
01:29:24,839 --> 01:29:25,897
l don't understand, Madan.

1146
01:29:25,974 --> 01:29:27,771
Mother said that you
felt bad because..

1147
01:29:27,842 --> 01:29:30,208
..l didn't sign on the
papers that day.

1148
01:29:30,845 --> 01:29:32,813
Oh! That day!

1149
01:29:33,114 --> 01:29:36,982
l didn't complain about you to
ma'am, dear. l just told her.

1150
01:29:37,118 --> 01:29:39,382
l don't have any complains
from you. No complains.

1151
01:29:39,454 --> 01:29:40,512
So you have forgiven me?

1152
01:29:40,789 --> 01:29:45,283
Yes, dear. Like father like son.

1153
01:29:47,162 --> 01:29:48,891
Madan.
- Yes.

1154
01:29:49,798 --> 01:29:52,266
Right now l have come
for some personal work.

1155
01:29:52,467 --> 01:29:53,900
Tell me, uncle. What's the matter?

1156
01:29:54,102 --> 01:29:56,935
Dear, Sheela's alliance
has been fixed.

1157
01:29:57,305 --> 01:29:58,932
We have spoken to the guy's family.

1158
01:29:59,007 --> 01:30:02,204
Uncle, that's really great! Now
why to delay the marriage?

1159
01:30:03,411 --> 01:30:07,279
No reason for that. The guy's
family is demanding 1 lakh.

1160
01:30:07,482 --> 01:30:09,347
1 lakh!
- Yes, dear.

1161
01:30:09,551 --> 01:30:12,384
ln this country a guy
is worth 1 lakh!

1162
01:30:13,088 --> 01:30:17,184
And the girl.. who is the mother
of his future child..

1163
01:30:18,226 --> 01:30:21,354
..whose child is the future
of this country..

1164
01:30:21,996 --> 01:30:25,432
..she has no respect and value!

1165
01:30:26,101 --> 01:30:29,400
Madan, we are helpless. This
is what has been happening.

1166
01:30:29,938 --> 01:30:32,099
This is the ritual of our country.

1167
01:30:32,173 --> 01:30:34,437
But uncle, if we educated people..

1168
01:30:34,509 --> 01:30:37,239
..can't change the wrong
norms of the country..

1169
01:30:37,312 --> 01:30:38,438
..then who will change it?

1170
01:30:39,414 --> 01:30:42,383
May Mr. Rai's soul rest in peace!

1171
01:30:43,051 --> 01:30:47,010
Madan, he had promised
to give 1 lakh.

1172
01:30:48,523 --> 01:30:50,354
Father had agreed to give 1 lakh?

1173
01:30:51,392 --> 01:30:53,860
The father who loved
his son immensely..

1174
01:30:54,028 --> 01:30:57,464
..today when he is dead then this
is how son is repaying his love.

1175
01:30:57,532 --> 01:30:59,864
Mother, don't misunderstand me.

1176
01:31:00,101 --> 01:31:02,092
l am doing what father told me.

1177
01:31:02,837 --> 01:31:04,964
But l don't believe
in these wrong norms.

1178
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:06,802
To hell with that!

1179
01:31:06,875 --> 01:31:09,503
You should fulfil your
father's promise!

1180
01:31:09,811 --> 01:31:11,108
This is the tradition
of this family!

1181
01:31:11,346 --> 01:31:13,211
Mr. Girdarilal, l
am right, am l not?

1182
01:31:16,251 --> 01:31:18,185
l know who is spoiling you.

1183
01:31:18,286 --> 01:31:19,810
Shameless! You were
standing here and..

1184
01:31:19,888 --> 01:31:20,946
..eavesdropping on your
wedding conversation!

1185
01:31:21,156 --> 01:31:22,214
l won't marry!

1186
01:31:22,824 --> 01:31:24,951
You won't marry! How dare you!

1187
01:31:25,927 --> 01:31:28,293
Who are you to take this
decision? Shameless!

1188
01:31:28,763 --> 01:31:29,821
Get lost!

1189
01:31:29,898 --> 01:31:30,956
Come, Sheela. Go to your room.

1190
01:31:32,033 --> 01:31:33,091
Did you see that, Mr. Girdarilal!

1191
01:31:33,168 --> 01:31:34,362
What is my position in this house?

1192
01:31:34,803 --> 01:31:36,464
l know who is now ruling this house!

1193
01:31:36,771 --> 01:31:39,137
Mother, l will give uncle
a cheque of 1 lakh.

1194
01:31:39,774 --> 01:31:41,765
Don't be angry at Madan, ma'am.

1195
01:31:41,876 --> 01:31:44,470
lt was just his obstinacy.
l will get the cheque.

1196
01:31:50,852 --> 01:31:52,183
Who has kept the vessels here?

1197
01:31:52,787 --> 01:31:54,448
Ma'am, your daughter-in-law
has washed it.

1198
01:31:55,123 --> 01:31:58,092
Daughter-in-law? There
are servants at home.

1199
01:31:58,426 --> 01:31:59,791
She just wants to show her husband..

1200
01:31:59,861 --> 01:32:02,295
..that she is being made
to work like a servant!

1201
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:03,829
Atrocities are being
committed on her.

1202
01:32:04,132 --> 01:32:06,430
This woman will surely separate
the mother and son.

1203
01:32:07,135 --> 01:32:08,796
You pretend to be virtuous!

1204
01:32:10,371 --> 01:32:12,339
O my God!
- Mother!

1205
01:32:12,874 --> 01:32:14,034
Beware if you touched me!

1206
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:18,309
O my God! O my God!

1207
01:32:19,414 --> 01:32:20,472
O my God!

1208
01:32:40,768 --> 01:32:41,860
Are you going somewhere, Geeta?

1209
01:32:42,403 --> 01:32:43,836
Yes.
- Where?

1210
01:32:44,906 --> 01:32:47,431
Great! You only said that we
will go out in the evening.

1211
01:32:48,509 --> 01:32:49,771
l am so sorry, Geeta.

1212
01:32:50,044 --> 01:32:52,239
l was so engrossed in my office
work. l just forgot.

1213
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:53,438
l will just get ready.

1214
01:32:53,514 --> 01:32:56,005
You get ready. l will take
mother's permission.

1215
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:05,020
She separates my children from me.

1216
01:33:06,027 --> 01:33:07,995
She snatched my Madan from me.

1217
01:33:17,872 --> 01:33:19,169
lt's hurting a lot.

1218
01:33:20,975 --> 01:33:23,739
Your massage makes
me feel so better.

1219
01:33:26,948 --> 01:33:29,212
None of my wish was fulfilled.

1220
01:33:31,819 --> 01:33:36,188
l wish l had got a nice
daughter-in-law.

1221
01:33:37,959 --> 01:33:41,861
She would serve me..
understand my sorrow.

1222
01:33:43,932 --> 01:33:45,490
But how could l have got one?

1223
01:33:47,769 --> 01:33:51,933
l am unfortunate.
Really unfortunate.

1224
01:33:54,075 --> 01:33:57,374
You! You won't let me sit
peacefully here too!

1225
01:33:58,246 --> 01:34:00,373
Cheater! What's the need
to shed crocodile tears?

1226
01:34:01,115 --> 01:34:03,948
With these crocodile tears you
snatched my son too from me!

1227
01:34:04,018 --> 01:34:05,076
Get lost!

1228
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:17,088
lt's inauspicious.

1229
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:19,166
A new trouble is going to
befall on this house.

1230
01:34:19,801 --> 01:34:20,859
Come, Mr. Girdarilal!

1231
01:34:21,436 --> 01:34:23,199
Everyday a new problem!

1232
01:34:24,138 --> 01:34:26,106
God save this house
from destruction!

1233
01:34:26,407 --> 01:34:27,465
Now what happened?

1234
01:34:28,209 --> 01:34:30,871
Ma'am, that cheque of
1 lakh has bounced.

1235
01:34:31,045 --> 01:34:32,740
Cheque has bounced?
- Yes, Madan!

1236
01:34:32,814 --> 01:34:33,872
How is this possible?

1237
01:34:34,082 --> 01:34:35,982
There is only 15000
rupees in the bank.

1238
01:34:37,285 --> 01:34:38,343
15000!

1239
01:34:39,153 --> 01:34:41,178
l know why all this is happening!

1240
01:34:41,289 --> 01:34:42,813
l know everything!

1241
01:34:43,491 --> 01:34:46,858
God, save us. Save us.

1242
01:34:50,031 --> 01:34:53,000
Mr. Soni.. before too l told you.

1243
01:34:53,434 --> 01:34:55,265
There is some mistake
in the accounts.

1244
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:58,102
You are ClD's responsible officer.

1245
01:34:58,172 --> 01:35:01,141
l have decided to hand
over this case to you.

1246
01:35:01,209 --> 01:35:03,973
Don't worry, Mr. Madan.
l will find out everything.

1247
01:35:04,045 --> 01:35:06,070
And in this matter l will
help you the best l can.

1248
01:35:06,247 --> 01:35:09,341
Now permit me to leave.
- Thank you very much. - All right!

1249
01:35:09,951 --> 01:35:11,179
Yes, Madan speaking.

1250
01:35:11,853 --> 01:35:13,218
Not today. lt will take 2-3 days.

1251
01:35:13,788 --> 01:35:14,948
Thank you very much.

1252
01:35:18,126 --> 01:35:19,184
That will be all.

1253
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:26,333
Mr. Madan, it's really shameful!

1254
01:35:26,868 --> 01:35:28,165
What do you mean?

1255
01:35:28,903 --> 01:35:30,928
lt's really shameful for you!

1256
01:35:31,005 --> 01:35:32,404
Mr. Agarwal, what are
you trying to say?

1257
01:35:32,473 --> 01:35:33,997
Your second cheque too has bounced.

1258
01:35:34,075 --> 01:35:37,875
So what? l will issue another
cheque in a week!

1259
01:35:37,945 --> 01:35:40,743
l can't even wait for a day,
Mr. Madan! - Pardon me.

1260
01:35:40,815 --> 01:35:42,942
l am not a billionaire like you
that l can wait for a week.

1261
01:35:43,151 --> 01:35:45,881
There is only one option,
Mr. Agarwal! Trust me.

1262
01:35:45,953 --> 01:35:48,478
l told you that l can't
wait even for a day.

1263
01:35:48,756 --> 01:35:49,814
l am helpless.

1264
01:35:49,891 --> 01:35:53,486
lt means nobody in the market
should trust you.

1265
01:35:53,828 --> 01:35:56,422
lf you don't trust me then you
can do anything you want.

1266
01:35:56,497 --> 01:35:59,159
Why don't you clearly say that
you have gone bankrupt!

1267
01:35:59,233 --> 01:36:02,828
Mr. Agarwal! The door is there!
Get lost! Please!

1268
01:36:32,733 --> 01:36:36,794
Sheela, l have a request.
Will you heed me?

1269
01:36:36,871 --> 01:36:37,963
Yes, sister-in-law.

1270
01:36:38,806 --> 01:36:41,400
Marry the guy with whom
your alliance is fixed.

1271
01:36:45,947 --> 01:36:47,209
Pardon me, sister-in-law.

1272
01:36:49,217 --> 01:36:52,812
Sheela, l again tell you.
l request you.

1273
01:36:52,954 --> 01:36:54,251
Forget that guy.

1274
01:36:54,989 --> 01:36:57,924
l can't forget him, sister-in-law!
l can never forget him!

1275
01:36:58,025 --> 01:37:00,493
l didn't commit any sin!
l didn't commit any crime!

1276
01:37:00,828 --> 01:37:04,764
Sheela, no matter whose
mistake it is..

1277
01:37:04,832 --> 01:37:07,300
..l am blamed for it.

1278
01:37:08,769 --> 01:37:12,205
Have mercy on me, Sheela. Have
mercy on your sister-in-law.

1279
01:37:16,944 --> 01:37:21,176
Don't l pity you? l don't
understand what will happen.

1280
01:37:21,482 --> 01:37:25,179
Who is that guy? How is he?
lf mother found out then?

1281
01:37:26,087 --> 01:37:30,251
Sheela, mother shouldn't find
out.. that you love him.

1282
01:37:31,259 --> 01:37:32,783
Mother shouldn't find out.

1283
01:37:35,329 --> 01:37:37,092
Shameless girl!

1284
01:37:37,165 --> 01:37:38,393
Why didn't you die
when you were born?

1285
01:37:39,467 --> 01:37:40,525
Unlucky girl!

1286
01:37:41,068 --> 01:37:43,798
You came in this house using
the charade of love..

1287
01:37:43,871 --> 01:37:45,964
..and you are teaching this
innocent girl the same thing!

1288
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:48,808
And this shameless girl
is learning it!

1289
01:37:50,811 --> 01:37:53,143
So she refused to marry
on your saying!

1290
01:37:54,048 --> 01:37:56,209
Who is he? Why don't you tell me?

1291
01:37:57,451 --> 01:38:00,181
You tell me!
- l don't know!

1292
01:38:00,421 --> 01:38:03,515
You don't know! You feign innocence!

1293
01:38:04,258 --> 01:38:07,819
l know all your flaws!

1294
01:38:08,196 --> 01:38:11,563
Unlucky! Shameless! Manglik!

1295
01:38:12,066 --> 01:38:13,124
What's the matter, mother?

1296
01:38:14,402 --> 01:38:15,460
What's the matter, mother?

1297
01:38:15,536 --> 01:38:17,834
Matter? Look at your wife's doings!

1298
01:38:17,939 --> 01:38:20,840
She was delivering a guy's love
message to your sister!

1299
01:38:21,242 --> 01:38:22,470
She is teaching her how to love!

1300
01:38:22,910 --> 01:38:24,969
And she was saying mother
shouldn't find out.

1301
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:27,372
What's the matter, Geeta?
ls this true?

1302
01:38:27,982 --> 01:38:30,246
l am asking you, is this true?
- l..

1303
01:38:30,318 --> 01:38:31,979
Did you say that mother
shouldn't find out!

1304
01:38:32,286 --> 01:38:33,344
Why don't you say?

1305
01:38:33,888 --> 01:38:35,185
l just say that..

1306
01:38:36,123 --> 01:38:37,283
Brother!
- Move, Sheela!

1307
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:40,491
l am worried. l am in debt.

1308
01:38:41,062 --> 01:38:45,123
And she has made this
house hell. Hell!

1309
01:38:46,067 --> 01:38:48,968
Madan! Madan, hit me more!
Punish me more!

1310
01:38:49,136 --> 01:38:52,162
But don't leave me like
this! Don't leave me!

1311
01:39:23,904 --> 01:39:27,840
l am very, very sorry, Renu.
Forgive me. l came late.

1312
01:39:27,908 --> 01:39:30,900
lts okay, Rekha. He is
my fiance Mr. Shyam!

1313
01:39:31,078 --> 01:39:32,136
Hello!
- Hello!

1314
01:39:32,213 --> 01:39:34,272
Come. Let's celebrate.

1315
01:39:34,482 --> 01:39:36,347
You will be really sad
if you went inside.

1316
01:39:36,951 --> 01:39:39,784
l will be sad? What's the matter?

1317
01:39:40,187 --> 01:39:42,018
lnside Madan is drinking.

1318
01:39:42,923 --> 01:39:45,255
Madan.. is drinking?

1319
01:39:46,394 --> 01:39:48,385
Excuse me. See you later.

1320
01:40:01,475 --> 01:40:02,533
Madan!

1321
01:40:07,014 --> 01:40:08,174
What's the matter, Madan?

1322
01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:11,450
What have you done to yourself?

1323
01:40:12,119 --> 01:40:13,450
Come on! Let's go home!

1324
01:40:14,055 --> 01:40:16,387
Home? l won't go!

1325
01:40:16,924 --> 01:40:18,915
l won't let you drink
anymore, Madan!

1326
01:40:18,993 --> 01:40:20,255
Don't stop me, Rekha.

1327
01:40:21,262 --> 01:40:24,026
l am really sad. So
l will drink a lot.

1328
01:40:24,432 --> 01:40:25,956
What is your sorrow, Madan?

1329
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,459
Nobody can understand my sorrow.

1330
01:40:29,103 --> 01:40:30,331
l understand, Madan!

1331
01:40:31,439 --> 01:40:33,964
l won't let you drink!
l won't let you drink!

1332
01:40:35,109 --> 01:40:37,771
Rekha, by drinking
l want to change..

1333
01:40:37,845 --> 01:40:40,905
..my heart, my mind and my world!

1334
01:40:58,866 --> 01:41:07,365
Give me your sorrow,
pain and your worries.

1335
01:41:09,410 --> 01:41:12,811
You are under the oath of sorrow.

1336

Give me the loneliness
of this heart.

1337

You are under the oath of sorrow.

Let me see how the
world harasses you.

1346
01:42:26,053 --> 01:42:34,119
Let me see how the
world harasses you.

1347
01:42:34,328 --> 01:42:42,394
Someday give me your sorrow.

1348

Someday give me your sorrow.

1349
01:42:59,453 --> 01:43:07,451
The heart l wanted, the
stranger received it.

1350

The heart l wanted, the
stranger received it.

Look at me, Madan. l'm your Rekha.

01:43:56,777 --> 01:43:59,337
l can transform all your
misery to happiness.

1356
01:43:59,847 --> 01:44:05,786
You? - Yes, l. no one can
love you as much as l do.

1357
01:44:10,124 --> 01:44:11,523
You still have the time, Madan.

1358
01:44:13,794 --> 01:44:17,787
Forget Geeta. Leave her.

1359
01:44:18,532 --> 01:44:19,897
Divorce Geeta.

1360
01:45:20,394 --> 01:45:21,861
Geeta, l'm drunk.

1361
01:45:28,736 --> 01:45:30,067
Geeta, l'm drunk.

1362
01:45:33,474 --> 01:45:34,736
Did you hear me?

1363
01:45:35,943 --> 01:45:37,001
Yes.

1364
01:45:37,077 --> 01:45:39,773
Aren't you angry at me? Don't
you have any complaints?

1365
01:45:41,115 --> 01:45:42,173
No.

1366
01:45:42,249 --> 01:45:44,183
Why don't you object? Why
don't you get angry at me?

1367
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:46,177
You are my lord.

1368
01:45:46,253 --> 01:45:49,222
But l've beaten you. l've
beaten you, Geeta.

1369
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:51,751
You had beaten me as you
think l belong to you.

1370
01:45:51,825 --> 01:45:52,883
Geeta!

1371
01:46:05,272 --> 01:46:06,762
Double pneumonia.
- Yes, doctor!

1372
01:46:07,107 --> 01:46:09,769
Madan's mother should not come to
know about Madan's condition..

1373
01:46:09,843 --> 01:46:11,174
No doctor can say this, doctor.

1374
01:46:14,948 --> 01:46:18,145
You? Here? lll-fated woman!

1375
01:46:18,786 --> 01:46:20,845
You've already taken the
life of Madan's father.

1376
01:46:20,921 --> 01:46:21,910
What do you want now?

1377
01:46:22,389 --> 01:46:25,449
lf something happens to
my Madan, l'll kill you.

1378
01:46:25,926 --> 01:46:28,793
Go away from here. Go away!

1379
01:46:32,933 --> 01:46:34,798
Madam, Priest is calling you.

1380
01:46:35,235 --> 01:46:36,293
l'll be there. You go.

1381
01:46:41,408 --> 01:46:42,466
Yes, priest?

1382
01:46:43,777 --> 01:46:46,473
Madam, three things are needed
for Madan to get well.

1383
01:46:46,814 --> 01:46:47,872
Tell me.

1384
01:46:47,948 --> 01:46:49,279
100 kg home made clarified butter.

1385
01:46:50,084 --> 01:46:51,813
7 black goats go give
away as donation.

1386
01:46:51,885 --> 01:46:54,945
And Rs.2500 as priests expense.

1387
01:46:57,991 --> 01:47:02,485
l'll give all this, Priest. But
l want my Madan to get well.

1388
01:47:05,933 --> 01:47:09,334
Father, what can l do?
How do l live?

1389
01:47:10,504 --> 01:47:16,443
l'm your daughter Geeta. lf l'm at
fault, God should take away my life.

1390
01:47:17,511 --> 01:47:19,308
But he should cure my Madan.

1391
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:22,781
O God! The moment this
ill-fated woman..

1392
01:47:22,850 --> 01:47:25,512
..entered this house,
l lost my husband.

1393
01:47:26,186 --> 01:47:28,245
This witch took life of my husband.

1394
01:47:28,956 --> 01:47:32,517
O God, take away this ill-fated
woman from this house.

1395
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:38,393
Keep away my Madan, my child,
from this ill-fated woman.

1396
01:47:50,077 --> 01:47:52,545
What are you doing to my son?
Go away from here.

1397
01:47:55,115 --> 01:47:57,140
l had warned you not to
go to Madan's room.

1398
01:47:57,417 --> 01:48:01,353
You are ill-fated woman. You'll
take his life if you stay with him.

1399
01:48:01,421 --> 01:48:02,479
Mother!

1400
01:48:02,556 --> 01:48:05,218
l'll throw you out of the house
before you touch him.

1401
01:48:05,292 --> 01:48:06,418
Don't be so unkind, mother.

1402
01:48:06,493 --> 01:48:08,358
Please, mother.

1403
01:48:08,428 --> 01:48:12,831
When you entered my home,
my husband died.

1404
01:48:13,834 --> 01:48:15,893
Get out of this house!

1405
01:48:16,136 --> 01:48:18,161
Mother, l'll go away
as soon as he gets well.

1406
01:48:18,238 --> 01:48:19,432
No! No! - Mother!

1407
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:21,166
You must go away from this home.

1408
01:48:21,241 --> 01:48:23,266
l'll not let you stay
here even for a moment.

1409
01:48:23,343 --> 01:48:25,777
Get lost from here. So many
times l said to her..

1410
01:48:25,846 --> 01:48:28,440
..that she should keep
away from my son.

1411
01:48:28,515 --> 01:48:29,777
Hari! Hari! Hari!

1412
01:48:29,850 --> 01:48:30,908
Greetings!

1413
01:48:31,785 --> 01:48:33,776
You sent away your daughter-in-law
at this time of night?

1414
01:48:34,254 --> 01:48:35,778
What if she commits suicide, madam?

1415
01:48:35,856 --> 01:48:38,518
That is what l want. lf she dies
everybody's problems will get over.

1416
01:48:54,541 --> 01:48:59,535
Dear, you are very hungry. Why
don't you eat something?

1417
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:02,009
Why don't you tell me,
what is wrong?

1418
01:49:02,816 --> 01:49:04,147
After all, l'm your mother.

1419
01:49:04,818 --> 01:49:07,252
Mother, l've no trouble.

1420
01:49:08,088 --> 01:49:09,817
Did your mother-in-law
say anything to you?

1421
01:49:09,957 --> 01:49:12,425
No! She too is my mother.

1422
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:16,388
Mother, leave me alone.
Please leave me alone.

1423
01:49:23,103 --> 01:49:27,369
Though life is cruel.

1424
01:49:28,942 --> 01:49:33,311
Though life is bitter,
life is strife.

1425
01:49:34,314 --> 01:49:42,449
lt is a moan from the heart.
lt's is the soul's grief.'

1426
01:49:42,789 --> 01:49:46,384
Though life is cruel.

1427
01:49:48,095 --> 01:49:52,088
Though life is bitter,
life is strife.

1428
01:49:52,799 --> 01:50:00,467
lt is a moan from the heart.
lt's is the soul's grief.'

1429
01:50:00,807 --> 01:50:05,005
Though life is cruel.

1430
01:50:20,827 --> 01:50:28,199
l've taken an oath that l'll
stay alive whatever happens.

1431
01:50:28,502 --> 01:50:35,874
Now why should l complain
for this situation?

1432
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:44,178
l'll spend rest of my
life in this manner.

1433
01:50:44,518 --> 01:50:51,924
So what if l've to live in pain?

1434
01:50:52,459 --> 01:50:56,293
Though life is cruel.

1435
01:50:57,898 --> 01:51:02,028
Though life is bitter,
life is strife.

1436
01:51:02,302 --> 01:51:10,141
lt is a moan from the heart.
lt's is the soul's grief.'

1437
01:51:10,210 --> 01:51:14,146
Though life is cruel.

1438
01:51:30,263 --> 01:51:37,362
Why should l complain
about my fate?

1439
01:51:38,071 --> 01:51:45,443
The same fate had given
me so much happiness.

1440
01:51:45,946 --> 01:51:53,182
lf today l've tears in my eyes.

1441
01:51:53,854 --> 01:52:01,226
ln the past l was bestowed
with a smile.

1442
01:52:01,528 --> 01:52:05,225
Though life is cruel.

1443
01:52:06,967 --> 01:52:11,131
Though life is bitter,
life is strife.

1444
01:52:11,538 --> 01:52:18,910
lt is a moan from the heart.
lt's is the soul's grief.'

1445
01:52:19,379 --> 01:52:23,076
Though life is cruel.

1446
01:52:29,089 --> 01:52:36,495
l've not lost my faith and hope.

1447
01:52:36,863 --> 01:52:44,235
One day the tide will turn.

1448
01:52:44,771 --> 01:52:52,109
One day the sorrow will go away.

1449
01:52:52,312 --> 01:53:00,117
One day the ray of
hope will emerge.

1450
01:53:01,521 --> 01:53:06,015
Though life is cruel.

1451
01:53:07,394 --> 01:53:11,888
Though life is bitter,
life is strife.

1452
01:53:15,869 --> 01:53:20,272
Geeta! Geeta!

1453
01:53:22,075 --> 01:53:23,770
Mother!
- Yes, my son!

1454
01:53:23,844 --> 01:53:25,402
Where is Geeta?

1455
01:53:25,745 --> 01:53:29,112
She is at her home. l tried to stop
her, but still she went away.

1456
01:53:30,484 --> 01:53:31,746
Madam!
- Yes?

1457
01:53:31,818 --> 01:53:32,876
lt's the time of worship.

1458
01:53:32,953 --> 01:53:34,011
All right. You go l'll come.

1459
01:53:35,755 --> 01:53:38,849
Sheela! lt's the time your brother
should be given medicines.

1460
01:53:38,925 --> 01:53:41,826
Please give him. l'll be back.

1461
01:53:45,765 --> 01:53:46,857
Sister-in-law!
- Sister-in-law!

1462
01:53:48,068 --> 01:53:49,899
Sheela! Gappu!

1463
01:53:52,205 --> 01:53:53,900
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!

1464
01:53:54,875 --> 01:53:56,968
Gappu! Please don't try.

1465
01:53:57,777 --> 01:53:58,835
Please don't cry.

1466
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:07,442
Sheela, how is your brother now?

1467
01:54:08,121 --> 01:54:09,281
Now he has regained consciousness.

1468
01:54:09,956 --> 01:54:11,014
Thank God!

1469
01:54:11,091 --> 01:54:14,026
He was asking about you,
sister-in-law.

1470
01:54:15,395 --> 01:54:20,298
God should give my life
to him. All my life.

1471
01:54:20,867 --> 01:54:23,165
Sister-in-law! Take
care of your health.

1472
01:54:23,737 --> 01:54:24,897
Brother will get well.

1473
01:54:26,806 --> 01:54:28,831
Alas! l was with him at this time.

1474
01:54:29,776 --> 01:54:31,038
l could have taken care of him.

1475
01:54:32,312 --> 01:54:37,477
Sheela, please take care of your
brother as l'm not there now.

1476
01:54:38,752 --> 01:54:41,482
Now please go, Sheela. What
if mother comes to know?

1477
01:54:42,222 --> 01:54:44,349
Okay, sister-in-law.
Let's go, Gappu!

1478
01:54:44,491 --> 01:54:48,222
l'll not come. l'll not come.
l'll stay with sister-in-law.

1479
01:54:49,496 --> 01:54:51,396
Gappu! You don't know anything.

1480
01:54:51,998 --> 01:54:54,489
l give you an oath on me,
you must go with Sheela.

1481
01:54:54,768 --> 01:54:57,430
l'll not stay with mother,
l'll stay with you.

1482
01:54:58,138 --> 01:54:59,935
l'll come later. Now you please go.

1483
01:55:00,006 --> 01:55:01,769
Sister-in-law, why
don't you eat food?

1484
01:55:01,975 --> 01:55:04,000
l'll eat. Please go now.

1485
01:55:04,878 --> 01:55:07,210
You'll surely come back?
- Yes, l'll definitely come back.

1486
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:08,338
Really you'll come?
- Yes.

1487
01:55:15,822 --> 01:55:19,383
Whether Mr. Madan is sick or fine,
we want out money back.

1488
01:55:19,459 --> 01:55:20,949
We must get our money back.

1489
01:55:21,027 --> 01:55:24,394
lf we don't get our money back,
we'll put him in jail.

1490
01:55:24,464 --> 01:55:26,056
We'll put him in hand-cuffs.

1491
01:55:26,132 --> 01:55:27,793
We'll take over his bungalow.

1492
01:55:27,867 --> 01:55:29,732
We'll anyhow take our money back.
- We'll put him in hand-cuffs.

1493
01:55:29,803 --> 01:55:32,101
We'll put him in jail.
- We'll take over his bungalow.

1494
01:55:34,407 --> 01:55:36,898
Madan, go inside. The doctor
has forbidden you to go out.

1495
01:55:36,977 --> 01:55:38,467
Please go and take rest.

1496
01:55:38,745 --> 01:55:42,078
Mother, let me go. l'll bring
money from anywhere.

1497
01:55:42,148 --> 01:55:45,345
No, Madan, l'll sell my jewellery.
l'll return their money.

1498
01:55:45,418 --> 01:55:47,852
Mother, you don't have to sell
jewellery as long as l'm alive.

1499
01:55:47,921 --> 01:55:49,411
You have a high fever.
You must take rest.

1500
01:55:49,489 --> 01:55:51,855
Until now, no one entered
this house with complaints.

1501
01:55:52,492 --> 01:55:54,483
l cannot tolerate
this insult, uncle.

1502
01:55:55,395 --> 01:55:56,794
No need to worry about it.

1503
01:55:56,863 --> 01:55:58,797
You are saying that there's
no need to worry.

1504
01:55:58,865 --> 01:56:02,096
They say they'll get me jailed.
They want to sell this house.

1505
01:56:02,168 --> 01:56:03,430
They say they'll get me hand-cuffed.

1506
01:56:03,503 --> 01:56:05,095
Madan!
- They are talking nonsense.

1507
01:56:05,171 --> 01:56:08,004
No one can do anything to you.
Giridharilal is still alive.

1508
01:56:08,074 --> 01:56:10,304
Uncle, you are alive and
you'll remain alive.

1509
01:56:10,510 --> 01:56:12,944
But l don't want to stay
alive with such insult.

1510
01:56:13,013 --> 01:56:14,776
l'll bring my jewellery,
l'll sell it and..

1511
01:56:14,848 --> 01:56:18,249
Mother, l'll not let you
sell the jewellery.

1512
01:56:18,318 --> 01:56:19,945
Okay, then we'll sell this bungalow.

1513
01:56:21,021 --> 01:56:24,388
No, mother, father had
built this bungalow.

1514
01:56:24,457 --> 01:56:26,448
lt's the question of
out family honour.

1515
01:56:26,726 --> 01:56:29,251
l care for your life more
than the family honour.

1516
01:56:30,096 --> 01:56:33,031
Nothing is more precious
than you for me.

1517
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:35,165
Why are you quiet, uncle?

1518
01:56:35,969 --> 01:56:38,233
l don't understand what
should be done.

1519
01:56:38,305 --> 01:56:40,830
l don't understand where so much
of our money has vanished.

1520
01:56:40,907 --> 01:56:43,137
What was it spent for?
Who swindled it?

1521
01:56:43,209 --> 01:56:44,733
Tell me, uncle, who swindled it?

1522
01:56:45,345 --> 01:56:47,176
l don't want to answer
this question.

1523
01:56:47,414 --> 01:56:50,281
You are elder to me. You
are my father's friend.

1524
01:56:50,350 --> 01:56:53,080
You are the manger of this firm.
You must answer me.

1525
01:56:53,153 --> 01:56:54,814
You are accountable.

1526
01:56:55,922 --> 01:56:57,947
Do you mean to say l swindled
all the money?

1527
01:56:58,124 --> 01:57:00,058
lt does not mean so,
Mr. Giridharilal.

1528
01:57:00,126 --> 01:57:02,185
So what else does it mean, madam?

1529
01:57:02,262 --> 01:57:04,423
Uncle, you always take out a
wrong meaning of what l say.

1530
01:57:04,497 --> 01:57:07,933
Whoever swindled the money,
you are accountable. You!

1531
01:57:08,902 --> 01:57:12,429
l'm not accountable. l'm
accountable to nothing.

1532
01:57:12,505 --> 01:57:13,767
Do you understand?

1533
01:57:13,873 --> 01:57:16,501
Mr. Giridharilal! Mr. Giridharilal!

1534
01:57:17,777 --> 01:57:18,835
Sister-in-law!

1535
01:57:19,446 --> 01:57:20,504
Sheela!

1536
01:57:24,517 --> 01:57:27,281
Please sit down. Why do
you look disturbed?

1537
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:28,782
ls everything all right or not?

1538
01:57:29,055 --> 01:57:31,523
Sister-in-law, brother
is in great difficulty.

1539
01:57:32,459 --> 01:57:36,020
l didn't want to tell you this.
Brother doesn't have any money.

1540
01:57:36,396 --> 01:57:38,261
So many people are knocking
at our door for repayments.

1541
01:57:39,065 --> 01:57:40,464
l don't know what will happen.

1542
01:57:41,534 --> 01:57:43,263
lf possible, sister-in-law,
please come back home.

1543
01:57:44,838 --> 01:57:46,806
You should be near brother
at such time.

1544
01:57:47,807 --> 01:57:49,297
How can l come, Sheela?

1545
01:57:49,876 --> 01:57:52,003
l'm getting late, sister-in-law.
l'll go.

1546
01:57:59,552 --> 01:58:02,453
l'm a ClD officer. He
is the bank accountant.

1547
01:58:02,822 --> 01:58:06,019
lf we don't meet Mr. Madan today,
all our efforts will go in vain.

1548
01:58:07,394 --> 01:58:08,918
All right. Go and meet him.

1549
01:58:08,995 --> 01:58:10,053
Thank you very much! Please come.

1550
01:58:10,930 --> 01:58:11,988
Mother!

1551
01:58:14,434 --> 01:58:15,492
What do you want, dear?

1552
01:58:15,568 --> 01:58:19,334
For God's sake, be kind
to me or l'll be ruined.

1553
01:58:19,572 --> 01:58:21,039
What do you want to say, dear?

1554
01:58:21,574 --> 01:58:23,906
Give all my jewellery and
money to me, mother.

1555
01:58:24,310 --> 01:58:27,370
He doesn't have money. He
is in great difficulty.

1556
01:58:27,447 --> 01:58:31,213
Geeta, this money was kept for you.

1557
01:58:31,785 --> 01:58:35,516
l don't want anything. lf something
happens to him, l'll be ruined.

1558
01:58:35,855 --> 01:58:40,315
Geeta, you asked for money
and jewellery from me.

1559
01:58:41,895 --> 01:58:43,954
Ask for something else, dear.

1560
01:58:44,864 --> 01:58:48,459
l can give you my life. l can
sacrifice my life for you.

1561
01:58:49,102 --> 01:58:52,037
l'm your mother, Geeta.
l'm your mother.

1562
01:58:52,472 --> 01:58:53,530
Mother!

1563
01:58:57,811 --> 01:58:59,836
Madam, our advocate has arrived.

1564
01:59:01,815 --> 01:59:02,873
Our advocate?
- Yes.

1565
01:59:03,950 --> 01:59:05,008
Greetings!

1566
01:59:08,555 --> 01:59:11,183
Please sit down. Tell me.

1567
01:59:11,491 --> 01:59:13,356
l don't understand anything, madam.

1568
01:59:13,827 --> 01:59:14,885
Why do you say so?

1569
01:59:15,261 --> 01:59:16,319
This bungalow is kept mortgaged.

1570
01:59:17,397 --> 01:59:20,457
This bungalow is mortgaged?
Our bungalow?

1571
01:59:21,835 --> 01:59:22,893
With whom?

1572
01:59:23,102 --> 01:59:24,160
With Mr. Giridharilal.

1573
01:59:24,971 --> 01:59:26,097
What are you talking about?

1574
01:59:27,173 --> 01:59:31,234
O God, l don't understand anything.
l don't understand anything.

1575
01:59:33,079 --> 01:59:35,377
l'll ask for proof in the court.
How can Mr. Giridharilal..

1576
01:59:35,448 --> 01:59:36,813
..mortgage this bungalow?

1577
01:59:42,789 --> 01:59:43,881
Greetings, Mr. Giridharilal.

1578
01:59:44,324 --> 01:59:47,225
Greetings! Please come, priest.

1579
01:59:47,794 --> 01:59:48,852
What brings you here?

1580
01:59:48,928 --> 01:59:50,122
l came to you..

1581
01:59:50,196 --> 01:59:52,323
So you are here to talk
on behalf of them?

1582
01:59:52,532 --> 01:59:55,524
No, Mr. Giridharilal. l
was always on your side.

1583
01:59:55,802 --> 01:59:57,133
But whatever happened is bad.

1584
01:59:57,303 --> 02:00:01,433
Priest, you don't know how
they've behaved with me.

1585
02:00:01,875 --> 02:00:05,811
But l know it. Now l'll not stop
until l take over their bungalow.

1586
02:00:06,112 --> 02:00:08,842
You are sinful. You are
destroying that family.

1587
02:00:08,982 --> 02:00:11,473
But l'll not let this happen. Never!

1588
02:00:11,551 --> 02:00:14,076
You lived on the money l gave you.

1589
02:00:14,153 --> 02:00:16,144
You dare say you'll
not let it happen?

1590
02:00:16,556 --> 02:00:20,424
l'll be damned if l don't
make Madan beg on streets.

1591
02:00:20,493 --> 02:00:23,860
Mind your tongue, Mr. Giridharilal.
l'm still alive.

1592
02:00:24,097 --> 02:00:26,224
As long as l'm alive, you
cannot do anything to them.

1593
02:00:26,299 --> 02:00:28,096
l can even send you to jail.

1594
02:00:28,167 --> 02:00:31,933
How can you? Do you
think l'm a child?

1595
02:00:32,372 --> 02:00:34,772
You know everything that
l've done against them..

1596
02:00:34,841 --> 02:00:37,435
..but still you can't
do anything against me.

1597
02:00:37,877 --> 02:00:41,438
lf you open your mouth,
l'll kill you.

1598
02:00:42,115 --> 02:00:43,173
Let go of me.

1599
02:00:43,516 --> 02:00:48,180
l don't want to see your face.
Get out of my house. Get out!

1600
02:00:48,855 --> 02:00:51,517
l was a bad person before.
But now l'm not.

1601
02:00:52,191 --> 02:00:54,125
l had come to say something
else to you.

1602
02:00:54,327 --> 02:00:57,455
But you've harmed yourself. l'll
go to the police right now.

1603
02:00:57,530 --> 02:01:01,330
You dare threaten me with police?
l've them in my pockets.

1604
02:01:02,268 --> 02:01:04,327
Only your dead body will
reach the police.

1605
02:01:04,404 --> 02:01:05,803
Move aside!
- Wait!

1606
02:01:06,239 --> 02:01:08,139
l'll send your dead
body to the police.

1607
02:01:11,945 --> 02:01:15,540
Uncle! The bad deed always lands
you in such a situation.

1608
02:01:17,016 --> 02:01:21,214
l've heard all of it.. what you
have done to Madan's family.

1609
02:01:23,189 --> 02:01:26,955
lf l knew about it, l wouldn't
have come back from America.

1610
02:01:28,761 --> 02:01:31,958
Now l'll not stay here. l'll not.

1611
02:01:43,276 --> 02:01:47,770
l understand! l understand.. the
difficulties we face are..

1612
02:01:47,847 --> 02:01:53,444
..because you were going
to come to our home.

1613
02:01:54,087 --> 02:01:56,453
You were insulted and thrown away
from home, but still you came back?

1614
02:01:56,990 --> 02:01:58,787
Go back from this house immediately.

1615
02:01:59,225 --> 02:02:02,888
Mother! - Witch! As you
came my husband died.

1616
02:02:02,962 --> 02:02:05,123
Now that you've come, this
bungalow is mortgaged.

1617
02:02:05,198 --> 02:02:06,256
Get out of here.

1618
02:02:06,432 --> 02:02:08,263
Let me meet him just once, mother.

1619
02:02:08,334 --> 02:02:09,801
l warn you, don't call me mother.

1620
02:02:09,869 --> 02:02:11,530
One last time. l'll
not come back again.

1621
02:02:11,971 --> 02:02:14,804
l'll not let you ill- fated woman
to get anywhere near my son.

1622
02:02:15,541 --> 02:02:19,477
l always cared for this family.
He is in great difficulty.

1623
02:02:19,846 --> 02:02:21,814
Give me once chance. Perhaps
this might help..

1624
02:02:24,083 --> 02:02:27,416
l know what you are up to.
And even your excuses.

1625
02:02:27,754 --> 02:02:29,415
No, l'll not let you meet him.

1626
02:02:30,256 --> 02:02:32,417
l'll meet Madan. Surely
l'll meet him.

1627
02:02:32,492 --> 02:02:35,222
Today l'll meet him in any case.
Let me see who can stop me.

1628
02:02:35,294 --> 02:02:36,352
You dare do this?

1629
02:02:36,429 --> 02:02:37,919
Let go of me.

1630
02:02:38,498 --> 02:02:40,489
Today no power in the
world can stop me.

1631
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,093
Why just you, today l'll
not even fear the death.

1632
02:02:43,169 --> 02:02:44,227
Witch!

1633
02:02:46,272 --> 02:02:49,264
Wait! Wait, today l'll kill you.

1634
02:02:50,877 --> 02:02:53,869
Father, please help me.
What can l do?

1635
02:02:53,946 --> 02:02:56,506
How can l stay alive? l'm your
daughter Geeta, father.

1636
02:02:57,283 --> 02:02:59,012
Father, please help me.

1637
02:03:05,391 --> 02:03:07,518
You do not deserve to be called
as anyone's mother.

1638
02:03:08,161 --> 02:03:10,322
You don't feel love, compassion
or humanity.

1639
02:03:10,897 --> 02:03:13,263
You had killed father, not me.

1640
02:03:13,533 --> 02:03:15,524
You are responsible for
the death of father.

1641
02:03:16,002 --> 02:03:17,128
Now do you want to
take Madan's life..

1642
02:03:17,203 --> 02:03:18,465
..by keeping him away from me?

1643
02:03:18,538 --> 02:03:20,335
You must shut up, or l'll kill you.

1644
02:03:20,406 --> 02:03:22,966
Let go of me. l'm not ill-fated.

1645
02:03:23,042 --> 02:03:25,237
Your false ideas and notions
are ruining this family.

1646
02:03:25,311 --> 02:03:28,405
O God! This woman will make me mad.

1647
02:03:28,481 --> 02:03:29,743
Get out of here.

1648
02:03:35,321 --> 02:03:38,415
Wait.. l'll kill..
- mother! Mother!

1649
02:03:42,095 --> 02:03:43,494
Please accept my request, Madan.

1650
02:03:43,796 --> 02:03:45,320
l've brought money and
jewellery with me.

1651
02:03:45,398 --> 02:03:47,866
Please take it, perhaps your
troubles will get over.

1652
02:03:48,501 --> 02:03:50,366
Have you seen, Madan? See it.

1653
02:03:50,903 --> 02:03:53,098
You blamed Mr. Giridharilal,
now l can understand that..

1654
02:03:53,172 --> 02:03:55,504
..she had taken all the
money and jewellery.

1655
02:03:55,842 --> 02:03:57,104
She is a thief.

1656
02:03:57,176 --> 02:03:58,234
Please don't say so, mother.

1657
02:03:58,878 --> 02:04:00,778
Father brought her here
as your daughter-in-law.

1658
02:04:00,847 --> 02:04:02,940
Yes, and so she took away
your father's life.

1659
02:04:03,015 --> 02:04:04,073
Get lost from here.

1660
02:04:04,150 --> 02:04:06,084
Mother! She won't go
away from this house.

1661
02:04:06,519 --> 02:04:09,215
She won't go away? She won't
go away from this house?

1662
02:04:09,522 --> 02:04:13,253
ls it you who is saying this? Good.
Now l'd go out of this house.

1663
02:04:13,326 --> 02:04:15,453
Mother! You too won't
go away from this home.

1664
02:04:15,528 --> 02:04:17,462
Who are you to stop me?
- Mother!

1665
02:04:17,530 --> 02:04:18,792
Let go of me.

1666
02:04:19,065 --> 02:04:20,396
She has used her magic on you.

1667
02:04:20,933 --> 02:04:22,798
You've forgotten all about
your father's death.

1668
02:04:22,869 --> 02:04:26,965
Now l'll die. Now l'll give
up my life. l'll die..

1669
02:04:27,039 --> 02:04:28,097
Mother!

1670
02:04:31,344 --> 02:04:33,209
Today is the last day
of her life, mother.

1671
02:04:33,780 --> 02:04:36,408
From today this ill-fated woman
will not be in our house.

1672
02:04:37,016 --> 02:04:39,746
She will be dead. l can sacrifice
the most precious..

1673
02:04:39,819 --> 02:04:43,084
..thing in my life
to keep you happy.

1674
02:04:43,489 --> 02:04:46,947
l'll kill her! l'll kill her!

1675
02:04:47,026 --> 02:04:49,153
l'll kill her!

1676
02:04:49,228 --> 02:04:50,286
Mr. Madan!

1677
02:04:50,496 --> 02:04:52,327
Mr. Madan! Let go of her.

1678
02:04:52,398 --> 02:04:54,298
Let go of her, Mr. Madan. Let go.

1679
02:04:55,368 --> 02:04:57,495
She is a goddess. l'm sinful.

1680
02:04:58,104 --> 02:05:00,766
Madam, please forgive me.
Giridharilal gave me..

1681
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:03,001
..Rs.10000 and got her
birth-chart changed.

1682
02:05:03,075 --> 02:05:05,373
l changed her chart and
made her ill-fated.

1683
02:05:05,444 --> 02:05:07,002
She is not ill-fated.
She is not ill-fated.

1684
02:05:07,079 --> 02:05:12,517
O God! O God! What have l done?

1685
02:05:15,521 --> 02:05:18,046
My daughter! My dear!

1686
02:05:20,126 --> 02:05:24,085
Madan! Please forgive me.

1687
02:05:24,163 --> 02:05:25,221
Mother!

1688
02:05:29,802 --> 02:05:32,327
The girl is going to her in-laws.

1689
02:05:32,738 --> 02:05:36,469
She is adorned with ornaments.

1690
02:05:36,742 --> 02:05:39,404
And the girl is going
