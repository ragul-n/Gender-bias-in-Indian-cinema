What should I say about myself?

00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:42,638
Anything. For example, where do
you stay? Where have you studied?

Today, I woke up very
early in the morning.

There is a small playground
in front of our house.

53
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:36,238
People go there for morning walks.

54
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:39,761
And there is a flower bed
in the middle.

55
00:03:41,163 --> 00:03:44,774
And there is a Shiva temple
in one corner of the playground.

56
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:48,258
There was no one out there,
early in the morning.

57
00:03:48,815 --> 00:03:50,867
I saw a woman,

58
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:53,289
in front of the Shiva temple.

59
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:55,418
She was standing alone,

60

with folded hands.

61
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:59,458

saw the woman in the morning.

64
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:07,825
Okay, fine. Next question.

65
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:10,035
What will you do if you receive
fifty lakh rupees?

66
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:15,228
Speak up.

67
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:20,500
I want to do many things.
Should I say it all?

68
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:21,883

73
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:36,617
And you? Won't you
do something for yourself?

74
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:39,343
Hey, you are the one who
will play and win the fifty lakhs.

75
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:40,909
Don't you have
any desire of your own?

76
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:42,386
What is that?

77
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,804
I will also travel with my daughter.

78
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:47,627

Tell us your name and then...
- Write your name here. - Here?

Okay? - Hmm.
- Hey, just check on the sound.

And, I like,

95

air on the television.

I mean, I draw courage
to face my real-life struggles.

That is what I think.

101
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:45,351

earlier was that,

00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:46,993
people would tidy
their homes and cabinets. - Hey!

103
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,470

Now what?
- Bag.

Earlier, people would tidy
their homes and cabinets.

108
00:06:02,551 --> 00:06:04,134
But now, everyone is trying
to clean up their lives.

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,624
Should I carry this? Will it help?

180
00:09:47,425 --> 00:09:48,345
So, what did you say?

181
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:50,994
What will you do
if you win fifty lakh rupees?

182
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,949
I said whatever came to my mind.

183
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,902
Same here.

184
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:04,683
My mind had stopped working.

185
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,091
I got into some trouble
in the morning today.

186
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:35,651
Yes, tell me.

187
00:10:37,563 --> 00:10:38,618
No, it's alright.

188
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:47,552
How much do you need?

189
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:51,551
Okay, I will withdraw and keep it.

190
00:10:54,606 --> 00:10:55,473
Alright.

191
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:57,455
"As our eyes meet."

192
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:28,523
It was a bundle of
five hundred rupee notes.

193
00:11:29,537 --> 00:11:31,061
Do you know it
had fifty thousand rupees.

194
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:35,691
'Write it down.
Twice a day after food.'

195
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:36,811
'Okay?'

196
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,681
'Give me the money.'

197
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:40,416
Hey, number seven!

198
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:42,110
Come on.
- Srabony Barua, go inside, please.

199
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:51,935
[Indistinct chatter]

200
00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:53,301
Please, come in.

201
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:03,659
Do we have to get an X-Ray done?

202
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:06,004
There is a bruise here.

203
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:25,094
There is money in my wallet.

204
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:26,172
Oh, that is not a problem.

205
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:36,420
Sir, can you spare
two minutes. Thank you, sir.

206
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:41,820
The bag.

207
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:05,009
'Number ten. Juthi Khil!'

208
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:16,377
'Sister, may I make a request.'

209
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,201
'Please, do not negotiate.'

210
00:13:18,443 --> 00:13:22,670
'Buy what you like for rupees
thirty. One price, thirty rupees.'

211
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:25,127
Wait. Let me see, what is the
best way to get to Dumdum from here.

212
00:13:27,091 --> 00:13:29,447
No, it's okay. I will go home.

213
00:13:29,537 --> 00:13:30,731
Thank you so much.

214
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,314
This is for you.

215
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,652
Won't you have tea?

216
00:13:35,174 --> 00:13:36,710
Come on, let's have
some tea. It's 3 PM.

217
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:38,974
Please, come.

218
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:45,691
What happened to your money?

219
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:47,280
Oh, that wasn't my money.

220
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:48,910
That is Antara's money.

221
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,038
And that is the problem.

222
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:54,520
Have you asked the other
members of the family?

223
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,945
I don't have anyone.

224
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:01,474
And you?

225
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:05,560
Husband and daughter.

226
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,988
Today, I am also, in a fix.

227
00:14:13,915 --> 00:14:15,234
What happened?

228
00:14:30,297 --> 00:14:31,609
Hey, Buri!

229
00:14:32,562 --> 00:14:35,002
Buri, don't be late. It's 8:30 AM.

230
00:15:33,788 --> 00:15:35,576
She refused to go to school.

231
00:15:35,782 --> 00:15:37,174
Crying and chaos.

232
00:15:39,225 --> 00:15:40,991
Her father is not here.

233
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:43,388
Who knows where he brought her from?

234
00:15:48,943 --> 00:15:50,175
Today is not a good day.

235
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,840
Actually, she is
a very stubborn girl.

236
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:58,888
She fusses around with food.

237
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,356
I have no choice but to get that
particular vase for her.

238
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:04,818
How old is she?

239
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:06,570
Twelve.

240
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:13,891
Where will you get
an identical flower vase?

241
00:16:21,277 --> 00:16:23,387
Where did the money go
from inside the cabinet?

242
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:27,337
Cabinet, trunk, below
the bed... It's nowhere.

243
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:37,509
Is Antara, a friend of yours?

244
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:40,076
She will be my wife
after another two months.

245
00:16:40,838 --> 00:16:42,671
I had worked hard to save money.

246
00:16:46,576 --> 00:16:48,276
However, I have managed a little.

247
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:36,357
Who is it? What do you want?

248
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:39,141
It's me.
- Oh, come up here.

249
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,418
It is not possible to sell
second-hand goods at a good price.

250
00:17:49,032 --> 00:17:51,267
These days most people
take pictures on mobile phones.

251
00:17:51,714 --> 00:17:53,143
I'll give you ten thousand rupees.

252
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,667
What are you saying?
Just ten thousand?

253
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:58,382
How do I explain it to you? It will
lie at home. No one will buy it.

254
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,034
No, no, at least quote
a reasonable price.

255
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:02,326
Hey, I gave you a good price.

256
00:18:02,575 --> 00:18:04,979
No one will give you more than this.
- That is because I am in need,

257
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:06,583
otherwise, would I have sold it?

258
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:10,013
Don't you know how hard
I worked, saved and then bought it.

259
00:18:10,394 --> 00:18:13,120
Oh, dear! I am quoting the
final price. Now, don't negotiate.

260
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:14,710
Okay. Now, you may go.

261
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:36,489
No, listen to what I am saying.

262
00:18:37,053 --> 00:18:39,325
Listen, can't you manage
with fifteen thousand rupees?

263
00:18:39,523 --> 00:18:40,988
You have worked
so hard to save money.

264
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,432
The fifty thousand will just go.

265
00:18:43,276 --> 00:18:44,397
Hey, no. No.

266
00:18:44,984 --> 00:18:46,604
I am saying it
for your betterment. Yes.

267
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:52,172
How come you have such a big
amount,

268
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:55,175
in your bag?
- There you are.

269
00:18:58,326 --> 00:18:59,543
Please, have.
- I won't eat.

270
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:00,817
Hey, eat it.

271
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,913
After all, you
haven't eaten all day.

272
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,475
Otherwise, you will fall ill.

273
00:19:39,098 --> 00:19:40,563
Oh! Can you tell me what happened?

274
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:42,403
We had to face so much for
this greed for fifty lakh rupees.

275
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:45,714
Your hand. And I wasted
a complete workday.

276
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:49,752
Has the pain in your arm subsided?

277
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:53,621
That's good.

278
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:58,142
Come inside the house. This place
will go underwater in a while.

279
00:19:58,384 --> 00:19:59,762
Oh, no!
- Yes.

280
00:19:59,852 --> 00:20:01,938
There is tremendous waterlogging
here. Another fifteen minutes,

281
00:20:02,165 --> 00:20:04,027
and the children will start
playing with paper boats.

282
00:20:04,117 --> 00:20:06,416
Really, do children still, play
with paper boats? - Yes. Come in.

283
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:08,161
Come on.
- Come on, brother. Come inside.

284
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,801
This way, please.

285
00:20:18,773 --> 00:20:20,224
"If I think,"

286
00:20:20,912 --> 00:20:22,671
"I am just fine."

287
00:20:24,158 --> 00:20:25,499
"Life is good."

288
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,295
"Things are just fine."

289
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:31,032
"They got stuck in the rain."

290
00:20:31,588 --> 00:20:33,105
Open room number eleven.
- Sure.

291
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:35,040
We will sit here.
- Yes, yes, it's fine in here.

292
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:37,611
How will you sit here?
People will come and go.

293
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:39,018
You can go up and sit upstairs. Go.

294
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:40,315
I will send some tea.

295
00:20:41,364 --> 00:20:42,302
Let's go.

296
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:44,024
Come on.

297
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:45,812
Do I have to sign anywhere?

298
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:48,553
No, no. Just give me
two hundred rupees.

299
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:55,406
"My dreams hang in mid-air
while the clock goes on ticking.'

300
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,804
"Be it morning, dusk,"

301
00:20:58,894 --> 00:20:59,757
"or night,"

302
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:03,956
"that which is destined
to happen, is happening."

303
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,697
"Life is good."

304
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:11,373
"If I think,"

305
00:21:12,546 --> 00:21:14,203
"I am just fine."

306
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,109
"Life is good."

307
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:20,885
"Things are just fine."

308
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,087
The bathroom is right here.

309
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:35,410
Please, call me
if you need something?

310
00:21:44,154 --> 00:21:45,583
I'll leave my bag here.
- Hmm.

311
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:18,342
Potato fritters, chicken fry or
'makha muri.' What should I get you?

312
00:22:18,555 --> 00:22:20,365
No, no, we don't need anything.

313
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:50,547
Is the bathroom clean?
- Yes.

314
00:22:58,704 --> 00:23:00,199
The way it's raining!

315
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:03,973
I hope we don't end up
spending the night here.

316
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:07,007
Maybe someone will murder us?

317
00:23:11,586 --> 00:23:12,964
Are you so scared of dying?

318
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:22,599
The soul neither dies
nor can it take birth.

319
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,486
Did you read the Gita
inside the washroom.

320
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:29,970
They told us we can order food.

321
00:23:31,392 --> 00:23:32,821
Fritters or 'muri makha.'

322
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,953
Tell me, if you wish to eat.

323
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:41,689
Won't you tell Antara that
the money is not there?

324
00:23:43,808 --> 00:23:45,743
If I can arrange for
the entire amount,

325
00:23:46,021 --> 00:23:47,501
then what is the need to tell?

326
00:23:52,638 --> 00:23:53,862
That means,

327
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,137
the lies will remain
in between the two of you?

328
00:24:01,116 --> 00:24:03,703
Though, it should not be so,
in between husband and wife?

329
00:24:08,094 --> 00:24:09,743
What will you do about
your daughter's flower vase?

330
00:24:13,907 --> 00:24:16,545
[Indistinct chatter]

331
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,455
This is not from here, sister.

332
00:24:30,932 --> 00:24:32,485
It is from Khurja, Uttar Pradesh.

333
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,135
Can you order and get one for me?

334
00:24:34,772 --> 00:24:37,586
No. No one will be able to
get one for you, here.

335
00:24:38,363 --> 00:24:42,305
If you know someone who
is travelling to Delhi or Aligarh?

336
00:24:42,395 --> 00:24:43,566
Then give it to that person.

337
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:45,734
This is a very commonly
available design in Khurja.

338
00:24:45,954 --> 00:24:47,618
You will get it very easily.

339
00:25:03,528 --> 00:25:04,568
How much do you have in your bag?

340
00:25:06,334 --> 00:25:07,705
Fifty thousand.

341
00:25:10,687 --> 00:25:12,468
Antara did not call you even
once during the entire day?

342
00:25:13,508 --> 00:25:14,359
No.

343
00:25:14,952 --> 00:25:16,132
She dropped me a message.

344
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:18,411
What happened at
the audition for fifty lakhs?

345
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,130
I did not inform at home.

346
00:25:30,173 --> 00:25:31,433
There is no waterlogging!

347
00:25:32,107 --> 00:25:33,214
Come on, let us just leave.

348
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:08,387
Hey.

349
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:10,492
You have spent a lot since morning.

350
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:11,770
Hey, it's okay.
- No.

351
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,394
It's not alright.
- There you are.

352
00:26:22,644 --> 00:26:24,256
The story did not end.

353
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,290
Which story?

354
00:26:26,747 --> 00:26:27,738
Mine and yours.

355
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:29,918
Oh, mine is just...

356
00:26:31,062 --> 00:26:33,829
I gave fifteen thousand to Antara
today,

357
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:35,805
and I will see about the rest.

358
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:37,382
But your issue will not
be resolved so easily.

359
00:26:38,508 --> 00:26:40,706
No, I think I will get it,

360
00:26:41,192 --> 00:26:42,341
by the day after tomorrow.

361
00:26:42,505 --> 00:26:44,076
The flower vase?
- Yes.

362
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:46,339
I will fly to Delhi tomorrow
early in the morning.

363
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:48,544
And then another
four hours to Khurja.

364
00:26:59,942 --> 00:27:03,887
I would like to encash
my fixed deposit.

365
00:27:07,615 --> 00:27:09,007
Just fill this form and,

366
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:11,762
sign on the backside.

367
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,066
Yeah.

368
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:23,604
Listen, Antara.

369
00:27:24,337 --> 00:27:25,861
Yes, I have withdrawn the cash.

370
00:27:26,184 --> 00:27:28,867
I am going somewhere at the
moment. You will get it by evening.

371
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:30,957
Yes, of course.

372
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:34,226
Yes, yes. Listen, make
all the arrangements.

373
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:35,934
You can leave, tomorrow morning.

374
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,073
I cannot leave my daughter alone.

375
00:27:44,692 --> 00:27:46,935
So, Antara is travelling
tomorrow morning.

376
00:27:48,943 --> 00:27:52,328
I will pay for everything.
Her air ticket, hotel etc.

377
00:27:52,702 --> 00:27:54,776
And she will take ten thousand
for doing the job.

378
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:57,246
Oh, she is also, Antara?

379
00:27:59,231 --> 00:28:00,441
She is the same person.

380
00:28:02,192 --> 00:28:04,669
I have known your bride-to-be
since we were children.

381
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:06,875
Huh! What rubbish.
She is not my wife.

382
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:10,342
Hey, we used to live
in the same neighbourhood.

383
00:28:11,851 --> 00:28:15,552
However, I did not know
that she is getting married to you.

384
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,116
Hey, why are you mixing
the two stories? This is so strange?

385
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,242
She hasn't told you
about me, isn't it?

386
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,548
This is one of her bad habits.
She keeps secrets.

387
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:25,307
Listen, I have known
Antara for two years.

388
00:28:25,397 --> 00:28:26,604
She is not such a girl.

389
00:28:26,694 --> 00:28:28,304
And I have known her
for twenty years.

390
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,964
Each time she broke up with a guy,
I am the one who supported her.

391
00:28:31,054 --> 00:28:33,171
Nonsense! What rubbish
are you talking about?

392
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:35,443
Hey, please ask. Praddut,
Sowmalya... - Rot!

393
00:28:35,662 --> 00:28:37,113
They are all her ex-boyfriends.

394
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:39,558
And then, what is that
fellow's name. Lalit Singh.

395
00:28:39,648 --> 00:28:40,749
Hey, will you stop?

396
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:43,843
What silly tales!
- Hey, hey, listen. Come here.

397
00:28:44,282 --> 00:28:45,360
Wait.

398
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:48,767
Yeah, what?

399
00:28:51,185 --> 00:28:52,467
This is not mine.

400
00:28:52,702 --> 00:28:53,867
Take it.

401
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,100
"Heart..."

402
00:29:05,127 --> 00:29:09,146
"There is a heart within the heart."

403
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,685
"And deep within that is
another heart."

404
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:21,993
"A known home."

405
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,607
"Everything is chaotic
within the house."

406
00:29:27,836 --> 00:29:31,740
"Another house..."

407
00:29:32,714 --> 00:29:37,638
"A, lone mirror is swaying
in the wind."

408
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:44,038
"Search, search, search!"

409
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:48,183
"Wipe off the dust and filth."

410
00:29:49,762 --> 00:29:53,301
"Heart..."

411
00:30:00,322 --> 00:30:03,414
"Because I want to see myself,"

412
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:06,767
"fly with my new wings."

413
00:30:06,986 --> 00:30:10,066
"The desires in my heart,"

414
00:30:10,272 --> 00:30:12,963
"have changed their colours."

415
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:16,810
"Just before dawn breaks,"

416
00:30:16,994 --> 00:30:19,983
"someone wakes up in a dream."

417
00:30:20,073 --> 00:30:23,165
"I weave,"

418
00:30:23,394 --> 00:30:27,184
"a new tale with my words."

419
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:31,546
"I dream of the skies and flowers,"

420
00:30:31,636 --> 00:30:34,773
"and find a way to break out of
my mundane existence."

421
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:38,277
"And then I wake up in the morning."

422
00:30:38,689 --> 00:30:42,388
"I look at my heart in a new light."

423
00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:46,921
"The hidden desires of my heart..."

424
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,100
"Alone,"

425
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:54,193
"in secret."

426
00:31:01,487 --> 00:31:04,602
"Let all my loneliness
burn and dissolve."

427
00:31:04,877 --> 00:31:07,454
"Let me protect my heart."

428
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,603
"Let me forget those faces."

429
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:15,001
"My lost heart."

430
00:31:17,165 --> 00:31:20,795
"There is a heart within the heart."

431
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:26,578
"And deep within that is
another heart."

432
00:31:34,765 --> 00:31:36,334
So, what is it with you?

433
00:31:36,802 --> 00:31:38,692
Why did you keep
your mobile off all day?

434
00:31:39,253 --> 00:31:40,615
I had one meeting after another.

435
00:31:41,577 --> 00:31:44,119
So, what is the problem
in telling your son?

436
00:31:45,092 --> 00:31:46,936
Don't you know how he
behaves if you get late?

437
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:09,344
Why are you so late?

438
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:12,358
I was caught up somewhere.

439
00:32:14,126 --> 00:32:16,188
I called you so many times.

440
00:32:23,453 --> 00:32:24,287
It was switched off.

441
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,147
Will you eat or
have you already eaten?

442
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,163
Do I ever eat outside?

443
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:01,250
Krishna, heat the food.

444
00:33:28,446 --> 00:33:30,791
What is this? Did you fall?
- No.

445
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,742
Why do you have a bandage
on your arm? - It's nothing.

446
00:33:33,897 --> 00:33:35,491
Was your mobile switched off today?

447
00:33:35,902 --> 00:33:37,734
Quite a few people had
called from your office.

448
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:39,805
Samiran da. Mr. Nandi.

449
00:35:15,536 --> 00:35:16,518
Where was your meeting?

450
00:35:17,872 --> 00:35:19,646
Mahesh Tala, Bata Nagar.

451
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:21,369
Oh, dear!

452
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:23,970
To attend an office meeting,

453
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:25,809
you went so far, alone?

454
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:30,190
New client.

455
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:32,960
The office and factory
is on that side.

456
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:39,820
Srinivas said,
he doesn't know a thing.

457
00:35:41,257 --> 00:35:42,752
He will know only after
the site is approved.

458
00:35:47,442 --> 00:35:49,721
Please. I am not spying on you.
Okay!

459
00:35:50,623 --> 00:35:52,147
Kahon was getting upset.

460
00:35:52,947 --> 00:35:54,596
And so I called Srinivas.

461
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:11,356
I won't eat.
- Why?

462
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,191
I am in a fix.

463
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,664
Hello.

464
00:36:40,036 --> 00:36:41,216
Who are you?

465
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:44,865
Phone.

466
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:46,850
Who is it?

467
00:36:47,092 --> 00:36:48,807
I don't know. He won't
tell his name.

468
00:36:57,322 --> 00:36:58,384
Hello.

469
00:37:06,381 --> 00:37:07,407
Fine.

470
00:37:09,642 --> 00:37:10,939
What's up with you?

471
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:20,817
Why have you called?

472
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:02,488
Again you have closed your eyes?

473
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,015
Please, focus on what you are doing.

474
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,642
Stupid.

475
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:34,558
What is the meaning of this?

476
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,578
Hey!

477
00:39:41,858 --> 00:39:43,699
My geography paper did not go well.

478
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:46,007
Are your results out?

479
00:39:46,603 --> 00:39:47,885
Not yet.

480
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:51,642
Why didn't you do well?
Didn't you study?

481
00:39:54,764 --> 00:39:56,688
Now, you will have to study
all the subjects.

482
00:39:57,339 --> 00:39:59,757
Later you can focus on what
you like. - Literature.

483
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:03,704
Will you teach me
after studying literature,

484
00:40:03,794 --> 00:40:06,454
how to weave a fantastic tale?
- Great story?

485
00:40:07,956 --> 00:40:09,798
Do you know, that is everything.

486
00:40:11,281 --> 00:40:13,067
When there is
no story in one's life,

487
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:15,677
we weave our own tale.

488
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:19,462
Have you understood?
- Hmm.

489
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:36,409
All this unhappiness and chaos.

490
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,643
They are destroying this,

491
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,629
breaking that.

492
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,805
Can you tell me what are
we latching on to for hope? - Story?

493
00:40:49,106 --> 00:40:50,206
Absolutely.

494
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:52,476
Because there is a story, there is,

495
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:53,869
a design.

496
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:55,408
This lack of solidarity,

497
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,036
in the midst of that,
we have some control.

498
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:00,281
Have you understood?
- Hmm.

499
00:41:00,766 --> 00:41:02,113
I will teach you geography
from today.

500
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,538
And what will you teach me
after learning literature?

501
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:07,673
How to tell a great story?

502
00:41:22,203 --> 00:41:23,980
Hey, I don't like the poach.

503
00:41:24,237 --> 00:41:25,740
Should I boil an egg for you?

504
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,058
No.

505
00:41:27,764 --> 00:41:29,312
Give me oats.
- Okay.

506
00:41:40,762 --> 00:41:42,164
Are you going to work, today?

507
00:41:46,578 --> 00:41:49,024
The ones used to running.
- They will run!

508
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:00,182
Have you seen the CBSE results
of Kahon's school, this year?

509
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:03,271
Is it very bad?

510
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:06,092
I have been telling you
for two years to change the school.

511
00:42:06,998 --> 00:42:08,189
Hey!

512
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:09,874
He is just in class six.

513
00:42:09,964 --> 00:42:12,036
Yeah, so, after this
no school will take him.

514
00:42:13,007 --> 00:42:14,894
Why don't you understand?

515
00:42:20,316 --> 00:42:22,203
Now, I will have to
take the initiative.

516
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:23,861
Do it for yourself.

517
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:27,059
What should I do?

518
00:42:27,994 --> 00:42:29,826
A job or a business.

519
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:31,200
Whatever you like.

520
00:42:31,566 --> 00:42:33,124
And who will look after Kahon?

521
00:42:33,214 --> 00:42:34,543
I will get you the oats.

522
00:42:41,415 --> 00:42:42,725
So, the people who
go out and work,

523
00:42:43,348 --> 00:42:44,969
don't they look after
their children?

524
00:42:45,491 --> 00:42:46,736
Don't be silly.

525
00:42:48,238 --> 00:42:50,263
This is a dangerous age.

526
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:55,813
So, which age is not dangerous?

527
00:42:59,348 --> 00:43:00,676
Stupid!

528
00:43:02,206 --> 00:43:04,716
And if your phone is switched off
today, I'll kill you.

529
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:07,207
Hey, you!

530
00:43:09,232 --> 00:43:10,450
Sit, sit, sit.

531
00:43:18,165 --> 00:43:19,803
Will you be late today, as well?

532
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:23,146
Do I come late, every day?

533
00:43:25,676 --> 00:43:26,509
Do I?

534
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:29,798
When will you be back?

535
00:43:31,758 --> 00:43:33,077
By 7 PM.

536
00:43:55,815 --> 00:43:57,363
Morning, ma'am.
- Morning.

537
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:03,839
I know that, and that is why
my company is the best.

538
00:44:04,865 --> 00:44:06,211
How are you, ma'am?
- Fine, thank you. - Good morning.

539
00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:08,768
Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

540
00:44:08,858 --> 00:44:10,416
Good morning ma'am.
- Morning.

541
00:44:21,765 --> 00:44:23,799
Come in.
- Madam, we are all set.

542
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:25,521
I am just coming.

543
00:44:26,922 --> 00:44:28,195
Good morning, everyone.

544
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:30,917
It's my pleasure to present
before you, this unique machine.

545
00:44:31,787 --> 00:44:33,720
It increases your efficiency.

546
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,185
It's time saving.

547
00:44:35,275 --> 00:44:37,659
It's... - Just a second.
- Good morning, ma'am.

548
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:44,557
You may start.
- Yeah.

549
00:44:45,261 --> 00:44:49,090
This machine produces three types
of double chamber tea bags.

550
00:44:49,255 --> 00:44:50,510
As you can see here,

551
00:44:50,703 --> 00:44:53,149
the filter tea bag can be wrapped,

552
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:55,740
either with an outer paper envelope,

553
00:44:56,096 --> 00:44:58,817
or a aroma protection foil.

554
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:01,757
Now, this is something
very unique in this product.

555
00:45:03,095 --> 00:45:04,982
As we can see,

556
00:45:05,072 --> 00:45:08,628
the threads are knotted
securely, from the top of the bag,

557
00:45:08,718 --> 00:45:11,522
by two-needle stitches.
You can see them.

558
00:45:11,815 --> 00:45:13,491
One. This is on the left.

559
00:45:13,581 --> 00:45:15,195
Thank goodness,

560
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:17,449
at least, he looks interesting
from behind.

561
00:45:18,255 --> 00:45:22,505
Ugh! - This is a very important
part of our system.

562
00:45:27,297 --> 00:45:29,368
Sir, this bus's power is quite less.

563
00:45:30,284 --> 00:45:32,106
Who knows what
they have given us?

564
00:45:32,419 --> 00:45:33,748
Is it 1200 Watts?
- Yes.

565
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:35,452
I will get it replaced by tomorrow.

566
00:45:41,342 --> 00:45:43,613
Sir the fibre class clips
are 16 by 24.

567
00:45:44,017 --> 00:45:45,858
And the exterior MW is four inches.

568
00:45:47,102 --> 00:45:51,436
The positive is .52 and
the negative is .26 sir.

569
00:45:52,397 --> 00:45:54,623
It's not matching. Just check
the measurement on the strip.

570
00:45:55,108 --> 00:45:57,050
The correction is done, sir.
It is down here.

571
00:45:57,957 --> 00:45:59,377
The plan we had for phase
three, why don't you get that?

572
00:45:59,981 --> 00:46:01,786
Okay, sir. - Come on.
- We will get that.

573
00:46:11,287 --> 00:46:12,890
Ashish.

574
00:46:13,055 --> 00:46:14,841
It's a big investment.
- Hmm.

575
00:46:15,263 --> 00:46:18,194
Please, boycott the
year-wise financial burden.

576
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,236
Fine.
- So, our,

577
00:46:22,188 --> 00:46:23,984
existing machines...

578
00:46:24,305 --> 00:46:25,990
How will we dispose them off?

579
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,041
I mean, will we get
any returns from those?

580
00:46:29,682 --> 00:46:32,842
We can get good returns from
the new ones, ma'am.

581
00:46:34,235 --> 00:46:36,470
Okay, okay. Alright.

582
00:46:37,314 --> 00:46:40,812
In that case, work it out.
And, hurry up.

583
00:46:41,114 --> 00:46:42,442
Okay, fine.
- We must not delay this.

584
00:46:42,532 --> 00:46:43,789
We must not delay this at all.

585
00:46:45,439 --> 00:46:46,813
Pit chamber pack.

586
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:48,782
Good morning.
- Morning.

587
00:46:54,249 --> 00:46:55,980
So, what's going on around us?

588
00:46:57,107 --> 00:46:58,646
Middle-aged married woman,

589
00:46:58,736 --> 00:47:01,064
are getting closer to
their physical instructors.

590
00:47:06,065 --> 00:47:07,641
What has got into your head, now?

591
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:10,443
What will get into my head?
So strange!

592
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:12,486
Take a look at this article.

593
00:47:13,696 --> 00:47:16,298
The unbearable loneliness
of the privileged life.

594
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,876
Read it. You are never
up-to-date about anything.

595
00:47:26,273 --> 00:47:28,461
Look. All over urban India,

596
00:47:28,551 --> 00:47:30,505
privileged women
are struggling with loneliness.

597
00:47:30,862 --> 00:47:33,326
They are educated. They are
married at the right time.

598
00:47:33,711 --> 00:47:35,534
They have money. They have it all.

599
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,225
Yet everyone is so lonely. Isn't it?

600
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,097
And, see.

601
00:47:44,187 --> 00:47:46,213
And a professional marriage
counsellor has said that,

602
00:47:46,303 --> 00:47:49,291
many of these women carry on
with their personal trainers.

603
00:47:49,547 --> 00:47:51,012
Did you also, not have one?

604
00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:53,430
A young boy. He was
your yoga teacher?

605
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:57,122
Oh, no. I am confusing you
with someone else.

606
00:47:57,627 --> 00:48:01,036
Whatever. So, basically,
the physical barrier,

607
00:48:01,126 --> 00:48:03,673
that is broken. So, it gets easier.

608
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,744
Do you get it?
- Hmm.

609
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:09,920
Are only the women, lonely?
I don't believe that.

610
00:48:10,406 --> 00:48:13,494
No. Everyone is lonely.
I mean, look at me.

611
00:48:13,795 --> 00:48:17,624
They are on Facebook all night,
like pictures and mast*rb**e!

612
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,399
Oh, my God!
- What happened? - Ugh!

613
00:48:20,637 --> 00:48:22,707
I cannot manage
this girl any longer. Hey!

614
00:48:22,991 --> 00:48:25,080
Hey, come on. Get out!
- What is this?

615
00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:27,013
Go out and do whatever you like.
- What?

616
00:48:27,296 --> 00:48:29,403
Hey, why? I mean...
- Shut up!

617
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:32,571
What are you doing? Hey, my iPad.

618
00:48:33,029 --> 00:48:34,486
Bag! Ugh!

619
00:48:39,826 --> 00:48:40,898
Hello.

620
00:48:43,452 --> 00:48:44,973
Yes, tell me.

621
00:48:47,637 --> 00:48:49,790
Hey, first, tell me why
do you want to meet?

622
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:51,613
We can take time out to talk.

623
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,374
Okay, fine.

624
00:49:51,843 --> 00:49:53,025
It's right here.

625
00:49:53,272 --> 00:49:55,186
[Indistinct chatter]

626
00:49:55,424 --> 00:49:57,806
Last week...
- So, then, will you let me know?

627
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,552
[Indistinct]

628
00:50:02,412 --> 00:50:04,730
Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Good afternoon.

629
00:50:05,014 --> 00:50:06,259
Hi.

630
00:50:12,673 --> 00:50:14,725
After how long did he call?
- Who?

631
00:50:14,815 --> 00:50:16,456
Your husband.
- Oh?

632
00:50:17,262 --> 00:50:19,011
About seven to eight years.
- This table ma'am.

633
00:50:19,231 --> 00:50:20,468
Thank you.

634
00:50:21,265 --> 00:50:22,465
What does he want?

635
00:50:29,281 --> 00:50:30,710
Apparently, nothing.

636
00:50:31,214 --> 00:50:33,403
I have come to Kolkata for two days.

637
00:50:33,493 --> 00:50:35,088
I would like to meet you, once.

638
00:50:36,627 --> 00:50:39,375
He called me at home yesterday
and today at work.

639
00:50:48,894 --> 00:50:50,882
Will you meet him?
- Good afternoon.

640
00:50:52,523 --> 00:50:54,556
Good afternoon. 'Chello' kebab?

641
00:50:55,151 --> 00:50:56,827
Will you meet him?

642
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,026
What else should I order with
the 'Chello' kebab?

643
00:51:00,363 --> 00:51:01,746
Fresh lime or Mojito?

644
00:51:01,985 --> 00:51:04,311
Will you meet that man?

645
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:09,202
No.

646
00:51:11,264 --> 00:51:12,427
Fine.

647
00:51:12,601 --> 00:51:15,065
Mojito with no sugar syrup.
- Okay, ma'am.

648
00:51:15,642 --> 00:51:16,989
And more mint leaves.

649
00:51:18,289 --> 00:51:19,507
Thank you.
- Thank you.

650
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:21,788
Ma'am, may I?

651
00:51:34,529 --> 00:51:35,765
What are you looking at?

652
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:47,573
Look at that man.

653
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,657
Right there. The one with
packets in both hands.

654
00:51:54,398 --> 00:51:56,202
He is a distant cousin brother.

655
00:51:57,172 --> 00:52:00,525
Till some years back, he used to
work with our company?

656
00:52:03,815 --> 00:52:05,894
He started fighting on
behalf of the labours.

657
00:52:06,536 --> 00:52:07,690
That's it.

658
00:52:12,353 --> 00:52:14,057
Not only did he lose his job,

659
00:52:15,066 --> 00:52:17,255
my uncle taught my
elder uncle such a lesson,

660
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,453
that he will never be able to
work in a tea company ever.

661
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:23,376
Wherever he tried to work,

662
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,720
false allegations about him
reached the company.

663
00:52:30,265 --> 00:52:35,531
Our company had employed
a dedicated group to do this job.

664
00:52:36,273 --> 00:52:38,691
Now, he works for
a small printing press.

665
00:52:46,074 --> 00:52:48,200
Why is our company, so revengeful?

666
00:52:51,304 --> 00:52:55,051
What is the use of money and
power, if you cannot take revenge?

667
00:53:16,183 --> 00:53:17,786
Oh, wow! Facebook?

668
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:43,385
This is for you, on behalf of
the company.

669
00:53:43,475 --> 00:53:44,446
Thank you. Thank you so much.

670
00:53:44,536 --> 00:53:45,321
Wish you
all the best for the project.

671
00:53:45,411 --> 00:53:46,041
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

672
00:53:47,454 --> 00:53:49,716
Arya, now, you may say a few words.

673
00:53:49,869 --> 00:53:52,789
Oh, dear! I cannot articulate
my thoughts and speak properly.

674
00:53:53,152 --> 00:53:55,415
I invariably go off on a tangent.
Anyway.

675
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:57,655
I'll try to make a short speech.

676
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:01,319
So, I joined this company
three years back.

677
00:54:01,409 --> 00:54:04,821
And, I used to be
a very different human being.

678
00:54:05,231 --> 00:54:07,495
I was uninspired.
I was under-confident.

679
00:54:07,585 --> 00:54:09,174
I was very short-tempered.

680
00:54:09,709 --> 00:54:11,570
Also, I was very fickle minded.

681
00:54:11,827 --> 00:54:14,656
And there was this one person,
who changed my life.

682
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:16,363
And she is right there.

683
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,478
Thank you for teaching me,
how to be patient.

684
00:54:20,402 --> 00:54:22,234
For expanding my horizon.

685
00:54:22,976 --> 00:54:24,332
For inspiring me to do better.

686
00:54:25,357 --> 00:54:26,940
So, thank you for being there
in my life.

687
00:54:27,782 --> 00:54:28,962
Thank you.

688
00:54:29,344 --> 00:54:30,896
Also, I'd like to thank everyone.

689
00:54:30,986 --> 00:54:33,514
Thank you for the
beautiful gifts and the flowers.

690
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,914
I mean, I don't know, what I would
have done without you all.

691
00:54:37,004 --> 00:54:40,125
Because after I ended up in this
company, everything was new to me.

692
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,418
But the journey has been incredible.

693
00:54:42,508 --> 00:54:44,544
Hello.
- And, I had no experience.

694
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:47,584
Yes, I am speaking.

695
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:50,625
Yes. Greetings.

696
00:54:50,846 --> 00:54:52,297
'I have taken too much of
your time.'

697
00:54:55,198 --> 00:54:57,463
Why are you calling me
about this issue?

698
00:55:00,065 --> 00:55:01,640
'Thanks Arya,
for your lovely speech.'

699
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:04,103
I am sure you know my designation?

700
00:55:05,621 --> 00:55:08,802
This is an accounts department
issue. Why are you calling me?

701
00:55:11,594 --> 00:55:13,316
Don't ever do this.

702
00:55:15,243 --> 00:55:16,313
What is wrong with the accounts?

703
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:21,230
You have not released some dealer's
payment and he is calling me.

704
00:55:21,911 --> 00:55:22,966
Who? What is the name?

705
00:55:23,142 --> 00:55:24,989
There is no need to
get him into trouble.

706
00:55:25,415 --> 00:55:28,177
Hey, no. Last week,

707
00:55:29,396 --> 00:55:31,462
I sanctioned all the payments.

708
00:55:31,552 --> 00:55:32,811
Brother has stopped the payments.

709
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:35,287
We won't be able to release
any cheque before the year ends.

710
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:38,974
That is why family business means,

711
00:55:40,227 --> 00:55:41,576
lifelong drudgery.

712
00:55:42,044 --> 00:55:43,561
Ugh!
- So, leave it.

713
00:55:44,249 --> 00:55:45,309
In your generation,

714
00:55:45,399 --> 00:55:48,236
no one but you showed
interest in the family business.

715
00:55:48,734 --> 00:55:50,332
Everyone has chosen
their own profession.

716
00:55:50,969 --> 00:55:53,102
Had everyone taken
the responsibility together,

717
00:55:53,469 --> 00:55:55,066
then us uncles,

718
00:55:55,433 --> 00:55:57,192
would have left all this long back.

719
00:55:57,801 --> 00:55:59,735
Where would you have gone?
To the Himalayas?

720
00:56:01,082 --> 00:56:02,541
Hey, listen. Listen.

721
00:56:03,003 --> 00:56:04,520
I have something
to say to you. Come here.

722
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:08,031
So where is your
brilliant assistant off to?

723
00:56:10,378 --> 00:56:12,437
She is going for a research
programme in Texas.

724
00:56:12,812 --> 00:56:14,234
I see. Good.

725
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:18,117
Rajat has come to Kolkata.

726
00:56:19,259 --> 00:56:20,527
Have you met him?

727
00:56:21,238 --> 00:56:22,396
He called me.

728
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:24,976
He has created some new trouble,

729
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,137
in the money market, stocks etc.

730
00:56:28,235 --> 00:56:30,932
Anyway, that can be resolved.
We are there,

731
00:56:32,076 --> 00:56:33,644
after all, he is your husband.

732
00:56:34,406 --> 00:56:35,872
I get it.

733
00:56:37,682 --> 00:56:39,617
He wants to patch-up with you.

734
00:56:40,117 --> 00:56:42,198
And I suggest, you should
give him a chance.

735
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:43,891
Talk it out with him.

736
00:56:44,535 --> 00:56:46,016
After all, you are not
getting any younger.

737
00:56:47,276 --> 00:56:49,035
You pay your dealers,

738
00:56:49,416 --> 00:56:50,596
and I will look into this.

739
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:59,817
"Girls in white dresses
with blue satin sashes,"

740
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,283
"snowflakes that stay on my
nose and eyelashes."

741
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:06,830
"Silver white winters
that melt into spring,"

742
00:57:07,136 --> 00:57:10,676
"These are a few of
my favourite things."

743
00:57:11,453 --> 00:57:15,454
"When the dog bites,
when the bee stings..."

744
00:57:16,092 --> 00:57:18,642
"When I am feeling sad,"

745
00:57:18,892 --> 00:57:23,245
"I simply remember
my favourite thing, which is you."

746
00:57:25,929 --> 00:57:33,371
"And then I don't feel so bad."

747
00:57:42,382 --> 00:57:44,031
No, I will not meet him.

748
00:57:46,011 --> 00:57:48,118
We have stayed with each
other for so many years.

749
00:57:48,496 --> 00:57:49,721
Hello?

750
00:57:50,695 --> 00:57:53,214
We were together for nine years.

751
00:57:54,486 --> 00:57:57,246
Our wavelengths don't match
at certain basic places, Rajat.

752
00:57:57,544 --> 00:57:58,929
And we will never have
anything in common.

753
00:58:01,643 --> 00:58:03,635
Please, don't call me again.

754
00:58:06,241 --> 00:58:07,789
Hey, Rani!
- Yes?

755
00:58:07,879 --> 00:58:09,732
What is it? I can't hear a thing.

756
00:58:09,936 --> 00:58:11,108
Don't you charge it or what?

757
00:58:11,198 --> 00:58:12,405
I keep it on the charger.

758
00:58:12,581 --> 00:58:14,465
Where is it charged?
I can't hear a thing.

759
00:58:15,271 --> 00:58:16,498
In the next ten years,

760
00:58:16,588 --> 00:58:19,397
Indian real estate will
cross a hundred million dollars.

761
00:58:19,769 --> 00:58:20,749
Play.

762
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,506
The way your furniture
is wrapped in paper,

763
00:58:24,121 --> 00:58:25,467
it looks like installation art!

764
00:58:25,557 --> 00:58:27,986
Everything will settle down.
Just a matter of two days.

765
00:58:28,609 --> 00:58:32,796
Kajol, there is eight per cent
accelerated GDP growth.

766
00:58:33,098 --> 00:58:34,985
Rise in disposable income.

767
00:58:35,379 --> 00:58:38,741
And increase demand for quality
residential real estate.

768
00:58:38,979 --> 00:58:40,765
Why don't you?
- Hey, Gupta! Will you stop?

769
00:58:40,855 --> 00:58:42,881
Like the other day, I will
open your fly zip!

770
00:58:43,055 --> 00:58:44,750
Hey! Hey! What is this?

771
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:47,058
Hey, listen, today
it's just us, okay.

772
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,541
Our wives are also, not here.
- Mine is.

773
00:58:49,999 --> 00:58:50,960
I have a wife.
- Hey, right there!

774
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:52,298
I will get up there!

775
00:58:52,388 --> 00:58:55,605
Do you know, if I could
own a car like that.

776
00:58:55,921 --> 00:58:57,546
It is an awesome piece.
- 'Hey, bootlicker!'

777
00:58:57,636 --> 00:58:58,491
'What did you say?'

778
00:58:58,581 --> 00:59:00,568
The price is about 1.24.
- 'Am I a bootlicker?'

779
00:59:00,752 --> 00:59:03,142
I am a bootlicker? - What else?
- You! You are a bootlicker!

780
00:59:03,354 --> 00:59:05,177
Now, look at these.

781
00:59:05,267 --> 00:59:07,724
Hey, will you stop?
- Just don't talk rubbish!

782
00:59:08,301 --> 00:59:09,721
After an accident...
- 'You are calling me a bootlicker?'

783
00:59:09,914 --> 00:59:11,215
Keep quiet!
- No, say what I want to know?

784
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:12,991
All the FAQs about the car.
- [Indistinct]

785
00:59:13,081 --> 00:59:15,703
Oh! Bangla medium. How
would you know?

786
00:59:15,869 --> 00:59:17,545
What do you mean by abuse?
- Hey! Hey!

787
00:59:17,966 --> 00:59:19,533
How dare you call me a bootlicker?
- What is all this?

788
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:21,951
Why does this happen every day?
- What a nuisance!

789
00:59:22,243 --> 00:59:24,176
What don't you tell him?
- Shut up!

790
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:27,247
Disgusting!

791
00:59:30,511 --> 00:59:31,367
Darn!

792
01:00:03,124 --> 01:00:04,771
Will you click a few pictures of me?

793
01:00:05,058 --> 01:00:07,561
Hey. Sure.

794
01:00:10,453 --> 01:00:13,302
Someone has offered me
a modelling job on Facebook.

795
01:00:14,089 --> 01:00:15,372
Genuine?

796
01:00:16,059 --> 01:00:17,635
A lot of useless people
do such things.

797
01:00:19,027 --> 01:00:20,602
He is also, probably useless.

798
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:25,796
Initially, he said it is
an ad for inner-wear. - Okay.

799
01:00:26,254 --> 01:00:27,655
All sorts of rubbish.

800
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:38,766
Will you take the pictures for me?
- Hmm.

801
01:00:40,406 --> 01:00:42,714
Up until now, all the pictures
you have taken of me,

802
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,692
I have kept all of them in my album.

803
01:00:46,947 --> 01:00:47,808
Good.

804
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:51,471
If I ever organise an exhibition,
I will beg you to lend them to me.

805
01:00:58,717 --> 01:01:00,512
Do you love me?

806
01:01:01,052 --> 01:01:03,388
But you fear to say anything
because I am your friends' wife.

807
01:01:03,892 --> 01:01:05,157
You have lost your mind,
haven't you?

808
01:01:06,155 --> 01:01:07,621
Are you on drugs again?

809
01:01:15,316 --> 01:01:16,819
Will you sleep with me once?

810
01:01:17,643 --> 01:01:20,573
Let go. What nonsensical talk!

811
01:01:23,963 --> 01:01:24,970
Coward.

812
01:01:31,693 --> 01:01:33,387
I will come with you, today.

813
01:01:33,965 --> 01:01:34,982
Where?

814
01:01:35,284 --> 01:01:36,447
Anywhere.

815
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:38,371
But you have school?

816
01:01:38,536 --> 01:01:39,589
I won't go.

817
01:01:40,331 --> 01:01:41,210
Why?

818
01:01:41,773 --> 01:01:43,046
I am not feeling good.

819
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,208
When will grandma, come?

820
01:01:45,877 --> 01:01:46,939
Sunday.

821
01:01:51,162 --> 01:01:53,224
There are times when we
don't like to do stuff.

822
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:55,018
But we have to do them.

823
01:01:55,431 --> 01:01:56,567
As they say in that poem...

824
01:01:56,805 --> 01:01:59,086
I slept and dreamt
that life was a beauty.

825
01:01:59,176 --> 01:02:02,036
I woke and found that life is duty.

826
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:06,660
This Sunday, I and you will go out
very early and bring grandma home.

827
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,474
This Sunday.
- Hmm.

828
01:02:08,564 --> 01:02:09,784
Your grandma has holidays
on Monday and Tuesday.

829
01:02:10,461 --> 01:02:12,779
Then she will go back
on Wednesday morning?

830
01:02:13,317 --> 01:02:14,517
Well, she will have to go
when the school re-opens.

831
01:02:15,259 --> 01:02:16,395
After all, grandma
is the headmistress.

832
01:02:17,742 --> 01:02:19,959
After she retires next year, she
will stay with us longer.

833
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,102
Where is the passport? Right here.

834
01:03:05,755 --> 01:03:06,599
Okay.

835
01:03:13,951 --> 01:03:15,141
I will really miss you.

836
01:03:15,486 --> 01:03:16,490
Me too.

837
01:03:18,088 --> 01:03:19,974
Do you know, there is
something in you,

838
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,262
and maybe no one knows that.

839
01:03:22,352 --> 01:03:23,988
But that provides you sustenance.

840
01:03:24,078 --> 01:03:25,746
And that is the greatest
thing in your life.

841
01:03:26,954 --> 01:03:28,022
Come on, you better go inside.

842
01:03:28,572 --> 01:03:29,589
You are getting late.

843
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:30,996
Call me once you reach Delhi. Okay.

844
01:03:31,194 --> 01:03:32,907
Don't forget.
- Yes, ma'am.

845
01:03:33,515 --> 01:03:34,531
Love you.

846
01:03:34,825 --> 01:03:36,046
I love you.

847
01:03:36,916 --> 01:03:38,584
I love you. Love you. Love you.

848
01:03:39,653 --> 01:03:40,625
Go on.

849
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:43,839
Sister-in-law.

850
01:04:51,935 --> 01:04:54,029
Oh, my! It's you?

851
01:04:55,004 --> 01:04:56,051
Come in.

852
01:05:04,539 --> 01:05:05,682
How are you?

853
01:05:08,303 --> 01:05:09,262
And you all?

854
01:05:10,572 --> 01:05:11,931
As expected.

855
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:13,745
Sit.
- Hmm.

856
01:05:20,713 --> 01:05:22,263
Today, he is at home.

857
01:05:22,743 --> 01:05:23,878
Should I leave?

858
01:05:24,165 --> 01:05:26,443
No, no. What is that? Sit.

859
01:05:32,413 --> 01:05:33,739
Does he still, write.

860
01:05:34,876 --> 01:05:36,130
No.

861
01:05:36,514 --> 01:05:39,798
At times I force him to sit,
then he writes a line or two.

862
01:05:40,133 --> 01:05:41,012
Who is it?

863
01:05:42,451 --> 01:05:43,682
Has she come here
to poke fun at us?

864
01:05:44,225 --> 01:05:45,679
Did I not forbid you?

865
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:46,680
What are you doing?

866
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:47,949
You should see
her attitude in the office.

867
01:05:48,039 --> 01:05:49,356
Why are you acting crazy?

868
01:05:49,628 --> 01:05:51,705
For what her uncles did to you,

869
01:05:51,795 --> 01:05:53,159
why are you holding her
responsible for that?

870
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:55,068
Have I ever misbehaved
with you in office?

871
01:05:55,324 --> 01:05:57,410
She is the God of four hundred
workers. Managing Director!

872
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,832
I will not go from here.

873
01:05:59,311 --> 01:06:01,493
I will stay for as long as I like.
You do as you please.

874
01:06:03,906 --> 01:06:04,873
Hey, listen.

875
01:06:05,783 --> 01:06:07,054
Listen to me.
- Hey.

876
01:06:08,741 --> 01:06:09,804
I will clump your hair!

877
01:06:11,674 --> 01:06:13,248
Hey, can you tell me
what is she doing in my room?

878
01:06:13,624 --> 01:06:14,663
Out!

879
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,004
What is wrong with you?

880
01:06:17,715 --> 01:06:19,122
You are crossing your limits.

881
01:06:20,073 --> 01:06:22,959
If you are so angry then why did
you write the poem, the other day?

882
01:06:26,731 --> 01:06:27,978
'The storm broke my Buri's,'

883
01:06:28,713 --> 01:06:30,775
'glass doll.'

884
01:06:32,542 --> 01:06:35,883
'All I am left with is
a few broken pieces.'

885
01:06:40,462 --> 01:06:44,115
'There flies the dust
on the night, when dreams broke.'

886
01:06:45,066 --> 01:06:47,096
'But her home broke,
long before that,'

887
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:48,726
'in protest.'

888
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:54,128
After that?

889
01:06:58,899 --> 01:07:02,208
'My Buri's shadow now grows longer,'

890
01:07:03,743 --> 01:07:06,876
'jumps over the terrace parapet
to mix with the dust on the path.'

891
01:07:09,345 --> 01:07:11,000
'Is she still afraid of crying,'

892
01:07:11,631 --> 01:07:13,501
'as she still holds on
to the broken doll?'

893
01:07:13,845 --> 01:07:17,409
'All her sorrows are a secret.'

894
01:07:19,718 --> 01:07:21,612
'The pain of breaking,'

895
01:07:22,387 --> 01:07:23,786
'brings tears to her eyes.'

896
01:07:26,119 --> 01:07:27,646
'Does she still looks for
the broken doll,'

897
01:07:30,394 --> 01:07:32,000
'on her own?'

898
01:07:38,122 --> 01:07:39,401
Give her our burnt tea.

899
01:07:42,836 --> 01:07:44,307
And not the tea from
your wretched company.

900
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:58,404
Teentala.

901
01:09:00,585 --> 01:09:01,672
What do you mean?

902
01:09:07,081 --> 01:09:09,974
First, I thought
your name is incorrect.

903
01:09:11,277 --> 01:09:12,955
When I checked on Facebook,
I recognised you.

904
01:09:14,106 --> 01:09:16,080
Then I did a bit of online digging
on Google. That's it.

905
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,533
Such a huge tea company.
Managing Director.

906
01:09:19,765 --> 01:09:20,956
Would you like to have some tea?

907
01:09:21,587 --> 01:09:22,402
No.

908
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:24,112
Thanks.

909
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,813
So, the other day, why did you
mix up the story at the last phase?

910
01:09:30,821 --> 01:09:33,202
I am sure there are many
such characters in you.

911
01:09:33,578 --> 01:09:34,777
I just have one, that is Antara.

912
01:09:34,867 --> 01:09:37,957
Whatever story I think of,
it always revolves around her.

913
01:09:38,517 --> 01:09:40,571
Who told you that I have
other characters?

914
01:09:41,826 --> 01:09:42,817
No.

915
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,063
I just thought.

916
01:09:45,629 --> 01:09:47,515
So, for how long have you
been doing this?

917
01:09:53,309 --> 01:09:54,419
It must be,

918
01:09:56,193 --> 01:09:57,344
about five or six years.

919
01:09:57,823 --> 01:09:59,141
Oh, wow!

920
01:10:00,636 --> 01:10:01,923
For so many days?

921
01:10:02,459 --> 01:10:04,105
For me, this was just
the fourth time.

922
01:10:05,256 --> 01:10:06,431
Haven't you ever been caught?

923
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:10,627
I don't know whether everyone
is convinced or not, however,

924
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:12,912
no one has ever challenged me.

925
01:10:13,528 --> 01:10:15,462
Oh, wow! You have been doing this
for the past four to five years!

926
01:10:16,341 --> 01:10:17,787
I simply cannot get it into my head.

927
01:10:21,017 --> 01:10:22,999
Do you ever feel like a liar?

928
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:24,461
No.

929
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:27,146
Never.

930
01:10:32,134 --> 01:10:33,412
I am a civil engineer.

931
01:10:34,475 --> 01:10:35,906
Delta Construction Company.

932
01:10:36,505 --> 01:10:38,911
My wife's name is Zinnia,
and my son is Kahon.

933
01:10:39,709 --> 01:10:40,660
Kahon?

934
01:10:45,015 --> 01:10:46,766
You said that your daughter
is twelve years old.

935
01:10:47,684 --> 01:10:48,555
Kahon is eleven.

936
01:10:50,593 --> 01:10:51,648
So.

937
01:10:53,358 --> 01:10:54,948
Why do you make up tales?

938
01:10:58,137 --> 01:10:59,831
I don't know. I like to do it.

939
01:11:00,981 --> 01:11:02,228
This is just my fourth time.

940
01:11:04,042 --> 01:11:05,049
It's like...

941
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,901
It's like creating a new world.

942
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,890
And there is nothing
wrong with that.

943
01:11:14,565 --> 01:11:17,122
This is amazing.
The two players meet.

944
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:18,760
You won the first round.

945
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:21,270
But it wasn't fair play.

946
01:11:26,593 --> 01:11:28,750
Now we know each other's
true identities.

947
01:11:31,339 --> 01:11:33,449
So, there won't be a second round.

948
01:11:36,511 --> 01:11:37,402
Yes, of course.

949
01:11:38,573 --> 01:11:39,628
But I mean...

950
01:11:40,585 --> 01:11:41,922
We can share our experiences
with each other.

951
01:11:42,012 --> 01:11:43,540
I mean, it's a unique thing.
- I think,

952
01:11:48,969 --> 01:11:50,869
we want to be friends.

953
01:11:54,005 --> 01:11:55,535
Seeking companionship.

954
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,485
But the equation and parameters,

955
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:03,104
are completely different.

956
01:12:06,258 --> 01:12:07,272
Even a story has,

957
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,133
an equation and parameters.

958
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,034
Beginning, midst,

959
01:12:17,444 --> 01:12:18,370
and the end.

960
01:12:19,813 --> 01:12:21,501
And you cannot deny that.

961
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:26,478
Take care.

962
01:12:42,512 --> 01:12:43,527
You too.

963
01:12:45,642 --> 01:12:52,231
"Is this the end of my walk."

964
01:12:52,642 --> 01:12:58,241
"I feel so incomplete, deep within."

965
01:13:00,162 --> 01:13:01,672
Will you please increase the volume.

966
01:13:03,576 --> 01:13:05,379
"I am stuck."

967
01:13:05,796 --> 01:13:08,580
"I just want to live."

968
01:13:08,894 --> 01:13:12,770
"If I think of a life,"

969
01:13:13,553 --> 01:13:17,034
"that is worth living."

970
01:13:17,745 --> 01:13:20,280
"I am just fine."

971
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:22,500
"Life is good."

972
01:13:35,971 --> 01:13:37,231
Listen, here.

973
01:13:50,961 --> 01:13:52,289
What did he tell you?

974
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,165
He did not do well
in the geography paper?

975
01:13:55,486 --> 01:13:56,823
Just geography?

976
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,518
Look.

977
01:13:59,736 --> 01:14:01,650
Physics, history, mathematics.

978
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,748
Do you see in what state is he in?

979
01:14:04,893 --> 01:14:05,974
Nice.

980
01:14:06,193 --> 01:14:07,585
His Bengali and
English are very good.

981
01:14:09,748 --> 01:14:11,296
What is your problem? Seriously?

982
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:13,028
Are you really crazy,

983
01:14:13,118 --> 01:14:15,062
or you are just not bothered
about your child?

984
01:14:18,514 --> 01:14:20,044
Let me tell you clearly.

985
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:22,508
I will not keep him at home,
after this result.

986
01:14:23,846 --> 01:14:25,366
Ronita has given me all the details.

987
01:14:25,623 --> 01:14:27,061
The admission test is next month.

988
01:14:28,032 --> 01:14:29,242
That,

989
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:31,092
hostel in Kurseong?

990
01:14:31,569 --> 01:14:33,813
I know, you don't care.

991
01:14:34,078 --> 01:14:36,423
But I will not let my son
go on the wrong path.

992
01:14:36,881 --> 01:14:39,101
Just because he performed
poorly in one exam,

993
01:14:39,191 --> 01:14:40,639
will you send him to a hostel?

994
01:14:40,902 --> 01:14:42,835
This is your problem.

995
01:14:43,834 --> 01:14:46,070
You could not take any drastic step
in your life.

996
01:14:46,546 --> 01:14:49,615
So look, in spite of your brilliant
career, you are still here.

997
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:52,051
And look at your classmates.
They are so successful.

998
01:14:52,141 --> 01:14:53,287
Yes, they have made it big.

999
01:14:53,377 --> 01:14:55,266
North pole. South pole. So what?

1000
01:14:55,944 --> 01:14:57,107
Our Prafulla da,

1001
01:14:57,336 --> 01:14:58,490
he who delivers the newspaper.

1002
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:00,697
If he goes to Manhattan and
sells New York Times,

1003
01:15:00,787 --> 01:15:01,795
what will he become?

1004
01:15:02,207 --> 01:15:03,663
Will his life become meaningful?

1005
01:15:04,294 --> 01:15:07,390
And the equation is not so simple.
There is a problem with his studies,

1006
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,251
we need to figure that out
and solve it.

1007
01:15:09,341 --> 01:15:10,807
Kahon won't go anywhere.
He will stay here.

1008
01:15:11,064 --> 01:15:13,372
Fine. Then, I won't stay here.

1009
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,211
That's your wish.

1010
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:26,949
'Talking of people to dine,
I am alone.'

1011
01:15:28,433 --> 01:15:30,155
Who will switch off the television?
- 'No one wants to eat.'

1012
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:32,875
'Hereafter, I won't try to
prepare any new dish.'

1013
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:34,479
'Then do one thing, sister-in-law.'

1014
01:15:34,569 --> 01:15:36,493
'Don't cook anything today.'

1015
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:37,895
'Let it be.'

1016
01:15:51,508 --> 01:15:53,276
Please, don't come back
after two days.

1017
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:06,541
Hey.

1018
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:09,455
Hey.

1019
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,209
Why haven't you
changed your clothes?

1020
01:16:15,345 --> 01:16:17,250
Go and change.

1021
01:16:18,652 --> 01:16:19,788
Go.

1022
01:19:10,976 --> 01:19:12,085
Hey, Chabi da.

1023
01:19:17,488 --> 01:19:19,313
When?

1024
01:19:24,304 --> 01:19:25,807
I am coming.

1025
01:20:35,744 --> 01:20:37,275
Come.

1026
01:20:43,751 --> 01:20:45,994
Will he get a bypass?
- No.

1027
01:20:49,608 --> 01:20:50,400
Come.

1028
01:20:56,422 --> 01:20:57,353
Your mother,

1029
01:20:58,883 --> 01:21:01,748
came and knocked on
my door, last night.

1030
01:21:03,449 --> 01:21:04,892
The time was,

1031
01:21:05,281 --> 01:21:07,120
around 1:30 PM.

1032
01:21:08,711 --> 01:21:11,848
I came and saw, she was lying with
her legs and arms stretched apart.

1033
01:21:14,573 --> 01:21:15,834
She was panting?

1034
01:21:19,761 --> 01:21:22,802
She was trying to say something.

1035
01:21:24,165 --> 01:21:25,411
But she couldn't.

1036
01:21:29,162 --> 01:21:30,980
I went to the other room and
called everyone.

1037
01:21:35,216 --> 01:21:36,506
And then.

1038
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,020
Another ten minutes.

1039
01:21:44,487 --> 01:21:45,843
Name. Jayashree Sarkar.

1040
01:21:47,154 --> 01:21:48,957
Age. 64. Correct?

1041
01:21:49,485 --> 01:21:50,423
Yes.

1042
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:55,215
You said she passed at 2:15 AM?
- Yes.

1043
01:22:39,889 --> 01:22:41,450
One after the other,

1044
01:22:42,234 --> 01:22:44,880
all the rooms have
become empty, Kajol.

1045
01:22:48,398 --> 01:22:49,409
First floor.

1046
01:22:50,941 --> 01:22:51,982
Second floor.

1047
01:23:52,768 --> 01:23:53,925
Come downstairs.

1048
01:23:56,975 --> 01:23:58,843
Yes, I'll find out.

1049
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:01,225
Er... brother is asking,

1050
01:24:01,315 --> 01:24:02,624
whether you will
take aunt to Kolkata

1051
01:24:02,714 --> 01:24:04,244
or will you perform the rites here?

1052
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:06,150
No, no, let's take
mother to Kolkata.

1053
01:24:06,538 --> 01:24:07,601
We will take her, huh.

1054
01:24:09,484 --> 01:24:11,155
Mother, stayed here all her life.

1055
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:13,852
But whatever you decide.

1056
01:24:17,099 --> 01:24:18,059
Okay, we will do everything here.

1057
01:24:18,149 --> 01:24:19,839
Then, let me inform everyone.
- Hmm.

1058
01:24:23,138 --> 01:24:26,281
Your uncle who stays
in Chandan Nagar,

1059
01:24:26,576 --> 01:24:27,484
have you informed him?

1060
01:24:28,107 --> 01:24:29,302
No, I don't know.

1061
01:24:29,514 --> 01:24:31,925
Younger brother called
everyone in the morning.

1062
01:24:44,458 --> 01:24:46,825
"When in bliss,"

1063
01:24:47,681 --> 01:24:51,659
"I have seen you."

1064
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:56,063
"When in despair,"

1065
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:58,159
"I had you by my side."

She used to visit us often.

1069
01:25:08,329 --> 01:25:10,205
Auntie would love to hear her sing.

1070
01:25:15,505 --> 01:25:22,210
"I keep it a secret, when
I have lost you."

1071
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:29,487
"I lose you in a trance
and accomplish you."

1072
01:25:30,255 --> 01:25:37,198
"When in bliss,
I have seen you."

1073

"For my entire life,"

1074
01:25:45,872 --> 01:25:49,793
"you strike the strings of my lute."

1075
01:25:50,037 --> 01:25:55,753
"You have strung me again
and again."

1076
01:25:56,051 --> 01:26:02,521
"And that is why in
the soul of all my music,"

1077
01:26:02,804 --> 01:26:09,136

in my life."

"When in bliss,
I have seen you."

01:26:17,548 --> 01:26:22,157
"When in despair,
I had you by my side."

"When in bliss,
I have seen you."

1082
01:26:47,564 --> 01:26:53,885
"I don't fear anything, any longer."

1083
01:26:54,416 --> 01:26:56,758
"If my achievements end here,"

1084
01:26:56,848 --> 01:27:03,318
"you will take me to
new heights of awareness."

1085
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:10,303
"In new light and new darkness,"

1086
01:27:11,012 --> 01:27:17,333
"or on a vast seaside."

1087
01:27:17,549 --> 01:27:20,169
'I teach in a school around here.'

1088
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,852
'Oh, do you stay here?'

1089
01:27:24,192 --> 01:27:27,361
'Oh, I addressed you in a familiar
way, I hope you don't mind?'

1090
01:27:28,692 --> 01:27:31,138
'Had you addressed me otherwise,
I would have fought with you.'

1091
01:27:32,439 --> 01:27:33,465
I stay in Kolkata.

1092
01:27:33,978 --> 01:27:36,186
But I have never seen you
before now?

1093
01:27:36,546 --> 01:27:39,382
I have seen you on many occasions?

1094
01:27:39,873 --> 01:27:41,683
Today, I felt like talking to you.

1095
01:27:41,843 --> 01:27:42,767
You did the right thing.

1096
01:27:42,857 --> 01:27:44,790
That is how something beautiful,
comes into existence.

1097
01:27:45,729 --> 01:27:47,136
What is your name?
