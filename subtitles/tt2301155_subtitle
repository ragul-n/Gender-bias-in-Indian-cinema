1
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,680
11th January 1982.

2
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,546
Until that day,
there were no major skirmishes...

3
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,556
between the Bombay police
and the underworld...

4
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,353
that the public remembered.

5
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,829
I was all fired up...

6
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,554
to change the course of history.

7
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:42,860
I am...

8
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,532
Manya Surve!

9
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,938
I am Assistant Commissioner
of Police, Afaaque Baagraan.

10
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,602
I was to change
the course of history.

11
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,974
Until that day, the police force was
shackled by laws and directives.

12
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,774
I unshackled them!

13
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,878
This is the tale of that
very first police encounter.

14
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,287
M anohar.-.

15
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,468
M anohar.-.

16
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,597
M anohar.-.

17
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,738
What's the answer
to the fifth question?

18
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,739
Show me.

19
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,714
Sir!

20
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:05,806
Yes?

21
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,749
QKZY-

22
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,794
What's up, Manohar?

23
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:19,489
All good.

24
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:20,793
Through with your tests?

25
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,026
Yes.

26
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,658
How did you do?

27
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:24,793
Good.

28
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,335
How long are you going to sulk?

29
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,712
You look better when you smile.

30
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,341
Here... - Don't talk to me!

31
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,479
Couldn't you help me?

32
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,781
It was one question...

33
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,517
What's wrong is wrong and...

34
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,684
'And I never do anything wrong!'

35
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,052
Tell me something...

36
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,924
we've been seeing each
other for four years.

37
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:54,796
We love each other but you've
never taken me to your place...

38
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,400
you haven't introduced
me to your mother yet!

39
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,560
Now isn't that wrong?

40
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,365
All in good time.

41
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,666
'All in good time!'

42
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:04,639
I haven't met your family yet, wonder
when you will meet my family!

43
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,742
I will do both!

44
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,142
But first stop sulking
and stop fighting.

45
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,541
You fight when someone hurts you...

46
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,109
And it hurts when you love someone.

47
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,080
Right?

48
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,416
Have this.

49
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:26,493
Will you marry me even if
your mother doesn't approve of me?

50
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,690
No way!

51
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:28,858
I'll go with my mother's choice.

52
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,091
Mom...

53
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:32,466
Come.

54
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,469
M anohar.-.

55
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:34,835
This is Vidya.

56
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,930
I told you about her.

57
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,067
Season's greetings.

58
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,002
Today is a very auspicious day!

59
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,409
Come in...

60
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,671
Manya is lucky to have you.

61
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:48,149
What's a sweet girl
like her doing with you?

62
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,512
Well...

63
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:52,718
she loves him.

64
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,890
And why not?

65
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,518
This family is famous
for two things.

66
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,826
Mom's chicken gravy
and her blue-eyed boy.

67
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,862
Dada...

68
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,029
Aren't you on the run?

69
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,730
On the run for what?

70
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,135
Just because I beat up Bhatkar's
goon and broke his ribs?

71
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,740
When you aren't here,
Bhatkar's goons harass us.

72
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,211
They ask about you.

73
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,937
How long do we continue like this?

74
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,673
When will this be over?

75
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,718
It will be over soon, trust me.

76
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,013
Once I get rid of Bhatkar,
everything will be fine.

77
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,122
Don't think about this.

78
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,923
You should think
about Manya's wedding.

79
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,788
It will be a grand event.

80
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,955
We'll put up lights for three
days and play movies for everyone.

81
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,168
Bhargav. - Manohar.

82
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,837
What the.. Leave me.

83
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,488
Leave me.

84
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,254
Leave me.

85
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,797
Manohar,
why don't you do something?

86
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,730
What if he is your step-brother?

87
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,034
Save him...

88
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,105
Or he will die.

89
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,111
Save him...

90
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,937
I've grown up with
what you saw today.

91
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,064
My step-dad could barely
afford to feed us...

92
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,902
but he beat the hell out of us!

93
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,677
My mom...

94
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,313
she was so busy saving
me from his rage"

95
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,208
"that she forgot to save herself.

96
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,053
That is why graduating from
college is very important for me.

97
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,590
I could have told you
the answer during the test...

98
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,619
but I don't want to do anything
that will bring down my ambition.

99
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:48,199
Once I graduate and get a job...

100
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,226
I will walk away from it all.

101
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,995
Don't worry, Manohar.

102
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,232
Everything will be okay.

103
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:13,222
Can you not be on time for once?

104
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,257
The test results are out today.

105
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,817
I went to the temple to pray.

106
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:17,827
Oh please!

107
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,158
My mom and dad will be here soon.

108
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,391
But first the results.

109
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,228
You have to meet them.

110
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,733
Of course!

111
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,264
Oh yes.

112
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,669
- Vishal...
- Yes.

113
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,131
Roll number 118...

114
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:31,971
what did I score?

115
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,408
Let me check.

116
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,139
3-0-2!

117
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,648
Section 302.

118
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,218
What will you do with the result?

119
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,016
Even if the ink in
your pen is clean...

120
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,147
you have rogue blood
running through your veins.

121
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:49,318
What did I do?

122
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,384
You and your brother
are charged with murder.

123
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,020
But I did nothing.
Why are you hitting me?

124
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,259
Are you embarrassed of
being hit in front of everyone?

125
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,663
Weren't you embarrassed
when you committed murder?

126
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,431
This is not right, sir.

127
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,336
You stopped a policeman?

128
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,009
How dare you?

129
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,055
Why are you beating him up?

130
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,897
Stop.

131
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,221
What's going on?

132
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,699
Who is he?

133
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,725
I don't know.

134
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,734
Open it.

135
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,074
Please let me go.

136
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,769
I studied hard so that I could
be an honest family man like you.

137
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,007
Please!

138
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,240
Honest?

139
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,808
What makes you think I am honest?

140
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,250
My own kids think I'm a scoundrel.

141
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,016
Sir, this will ruin my life.

142
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,284
Please, I did nothing wrong.

143
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,824
You are right.

144
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,889
You did nothing wrong.

145
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,290
Your father did everything wrong.

146
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,957
He gave birth to two rascals!

147
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,828
Book him under section 302!

148
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,894
Sir...

149
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,798
Get in!

150
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,141
To hell with Bombay Police!

151
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,770
You tricked me...

152
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,212
you betrayed..

153
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,016
Shut up!

154
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,447
Shut up!

155
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,552
Your game is over.

156
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,119
- Pawar...
- Yes sir.

157
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,921
- Take us to Sion Hospital.
- Okay.

158
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:11,893
All of you have betrayed us.

159
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:12,993
If you had respected
the police uniform..

160
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,299
...you wouldn't be down in the dust.

161
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,805
I'll be down in the dust
the day I turn into ash.

162
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,569
I am still alive.

163
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,510
Your bullets turned
out to be useless.

164
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,913
I'm surprised...

165
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,148
your blood seems to have run dry...

166
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,520
but you haven't lost the nerve!

167
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,826
You know, destiny gives everyone
their fair share of life...

168
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,397
but now your destiny
has reached it's end.

169
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,439
First bring the criminals
sentenced for life.

170
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,368
Come on.

171
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,012
Get in line. Move.

172
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,483
He won't be hungry.

173
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,918
Rather than let your
share of food go waste,

174
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,588
it's better that Sheikh Munir
has everything from your plate.

175
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,119
You shared your meal with me,
so I owe you.

176
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,689
Otherwise you would be lying
on this table like your brother.

177
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,484
Remember this...

178
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:22,930
in here you can fight,
kill or be killed.

179
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,664
But you can't talk.

180
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,107
Never talk to the jailer.

181
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,367
Get it?

182
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,944
Who was it?

183
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,228
I don't know.

184
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,401
I didn't see the face.

185
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:03,029
It's your first day in here
and you're talking like a pro!

186
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:09,044
If your fancy dress competition
is over, can I leave?

187
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:13,650
Let them go and lock
up Potya in a solitary cell.

188
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,288
Munir...

189
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:25,991
thank you.

190
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,998
You can drop the thank you.

191
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,327
Two bottles of alcohol
is the price...

192
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,390
to kill you and your brother.

193
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,466
Whom did you kill?

194
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,528
No one... I am innocent.

195
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,006
You know, an innocent in ajaiL.

196
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:42,103
"And a condom in a brothel
have absolutely no value!

197
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,639
You look for one,
you'll get a thousand!

198
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:49,285
The thing is he got one bottle"

199
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,583
"and in four weeks
Potya will be released...

200
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,716
and head for the second bottle.

201
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,159
That means,
you have four weeks to live and...

202
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,194
Potya has four weeks to drink.

203
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,624
No.

204
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,056
I have four weeks to plan.

205
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,099
And who will help you?

206
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,395
You!

207
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,030
Why would I do that?

208
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,033
Because you owe me.

209
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:19,344
If you don't go up to heaven, one
day you will surely reach the top.

210
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:49,807
When is the wedding?

211
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,677
Next month...

212
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,411
but I haven't said 'yes'.

213
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,646
Why not?

214
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:58,486
Whom are you waiting for?

215
00:17:58,544 --> 00:17:59,716
You!

216
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,225
Don't you want me to wait for you?

217
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,484
You wouldn't ask
if you really wanted to!

218
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,096
If you weren't locked up in here,
I wouldn't need to ask!

219
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,531
Is it my fault that I am in here?

220
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,465
Are you saying that
I am to blame for this?

221
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,767
When you know the answer,
why do you want me to say it?

222
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,665
Are you fighting with
me or breaking up with me?

223
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,677
I am doing precisely
what you are here for!

224
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,509
I am giving you your freedom.

225
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,148
Freedom isn't meant
for either of us.

226
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,876
You are locked up in jail
and I am paying the price for it.

227
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,143
What price are you talking about?

228
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,517
You are out in the open.

229
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,452
You can get married
to anyone you want.

230
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,492
You can live the life
both of us dreamed of.

231
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,895
What do you want me to do?

232
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,360
Say 'yes!

233
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,135
M anohar.-.

234
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,136
Your test results...

235
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,641
It doesn't matter anymore.

236
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,179
Hello.

237
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,754
Hello.

238
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,553
M anya...

239
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,353
this is Veera.

240
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,661
Hello.

241
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:16,267
He is so strong
he can crush anyone.

242
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,401
The inmates fear Potya...

243
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,467
but they not only fear Veera,
they also respect him.

244
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,268
If anyone can help you...

245
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,871
it is Veera.

246
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,383
What do you want?

247
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,250
I want to learn from you.

248
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,953
Everybody wants to learn...

249
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,851
but fighting isn't for kids.

250
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,487
And I'm not a kid.

251
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,559
I'll do everything you say.

252
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,622
It's the student that
makes his master great.

253
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,660
If Eklavya hadn't
cut off his thumb...

254
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,397
no one would remember Drona today.

255
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,941
I'm ready to become Eklavya.

256
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,641
He cut off his own thumb...

257
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,607
I'll cut off my own hand.

258
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,677
What do you say?

259
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,749
In that case, you found Drona!

260
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,293
The Olympic games state...

261
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,994
victory and defeat don't matter...

262
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,933
you have to play with pride.

263
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:36,864
I say to hell with pride,
'cause here your life is at stake!

264
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,643
Kill or be killed!

265
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,633
M anya...

266
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:49,470
Manya, use the knife!

267
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,499
The new don of Yerwada prison...

268
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,508
Manya Surve.

269
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,682
A man has to become an animal
before he can become a human being.

270
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:36,626
I chose the opposite route.

271
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:39,185
You will always be an animal.

272
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,159
"And that's why you
will die a dog's death!

273
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,427
All thanks to the police.

274
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,501
Mothers don't give
birth to criminals...

275
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,561
it's the police that
makes criminals out of men!

276
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:53,568
It I hadn't killed Potya,
he would've killed me.

277
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:56,043
Death was always eager
to close in on you.

278
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,605
But you are fortunate that..

279
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:02,016
...life surrendered
to your charm once again.

280
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,744
I am shocked, officer.

281
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:08,181
I thought you are a coward
who shoots fake bullets...

282
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,086
but you are also a philosopher.

283
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:15,032
When I was in prison using
my charm to seduce life...

284
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,457
what were you up to?

285
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:20,060
Back in those days the Mastan
gang was terrorizing Bombay.

286
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:26,202
And the cops were
helpless because..

287
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,910
...the laws and official
diktats gave no recourse.

288
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,247
Move back.

289
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,676
Sir!

290
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,078
Did you take the
victim's statement?

291
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,120
She is in no state to talk...

292
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,012
and I'm in no state to face her.

293
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:43,491
Careful.

294
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,857
Help her to sit.

295
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,532
Cover him.

296
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,229
Step out.

297
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,243
I can't change what has happened...

298
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,647
but I promise that no one else
will go through this pain again.

299
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,718
And for that I need you to help me.

300
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,216
Don't be afraid...

301
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,550
tell me what happened.

302
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:22,828
My husband and I came from
Lucknow to celebrate our honeymoon.

303
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:26,227
We had returned from
watching a movie...

304
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,766
and my husband was
taking the key to our room.

305
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:34,742
That's when those goons
came down and kept staring at me.

306
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:38,775
My husband and I
came up to our room.

307
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,181
I was in the bathroom when...

308
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,813
Where's she?

309
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,079
Where's she? - What happened?

310
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:49,592
Move!

311
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:26,754
There were two jerks.

312
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,859
Only the Mastan gang is
capable of such atrocious acts-.

313
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,061
Question the hotel
staff and watchman.

314
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,894
No one will testify.

315
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,161
Why not?

316
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,865
If they don't talk,
torture them until they do.

317
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,876
We will torture them,
but they will kill them.

318
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,205
Who will testify against
the Mastan gang"

319
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,802
"and see their
kids become orphans?

320
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:47,309
I have promised the girl that...

321
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,384
I won't let anyone else
suffer what she went through.

322
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,244
Is that promise worthless?

323
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,881
At a time when even
the cops are worthless"

324
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,289
...you are holding on to a promise?

325
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,657
Stop talking like a coward!

326
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,662
We are responsible
for what happened to her.

327
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,130
I agree someone
else stripped her...

328
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,758
but it's our apathy that
ripped away her dignity.

329
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:10,072
And to make things worse...

330
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,369
you talk to him.

331
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:14,210
Salaam-walekum.

332
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,244
Walekum-a-salaam.

333
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:19,944
Bhende...

334
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,413
his polite mannerisms
are very potent.

335
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,719
Congratulations.

336
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,653
I mean,
you solved another big case.

337
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:32,158
So, what do you think?

338
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,031
I don't think it was difficult.

339
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,656
The crime took place
in a crowded area...

340
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,895
so you have plenty
of eye-witnesses.

341
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:43,096
And our cops are renowned
for their competence.

342
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:47,070
When a lion grows old,
even dogs bark at him.

343
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,810
You too can say what you want.

344
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:53,006
Tomorrow when you print
this report in your newspaper...

345
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:55,242
the morale of the
cops will go for a toss!

346
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,711
What morale are you talking about?

347
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:03,727
The eunuchs have better
morale than the cops.

348
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,220
I mean, you can blame
nature for their plight...

349
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:07,958
but what's your excuse?

350
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,964
Giving advice is easy, Sadik.

351
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:13,961
Do you have a solution?

352
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:15,436
Of course, I do.

353
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,206
Come.

354
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,143
Have you seen the film, 'Sholay'?

355
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,748
Not another story!

356
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,349
There was a dialogue
in that film...

357
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,413
'Only iron can cut iron.'

358
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:30,344
What are you getting at?

359
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,320
Zubair and Dilawar Haksar.

360
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,247
Constable llmtiaz's sons?

361
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:35,383
Yes.

362
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:38,428
Since you can't get Dharmendra
and Amitabh from Sholay...

363
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,958
you'll have to make do with them.

364
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,292
Where can I find them?

365
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,000
Salaam-walekum.

366
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,835
Salaam-walekum. - Salam!

367
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,440
Salaam-walekum.

368
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,272
Salaam-walekum.

369
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:00,374
Salaam-walekum.

370
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,876
Hey!

371
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,883
Dilawar...

372
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:11,912
Name?

373
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,888
Zubair Imtiaz Haksar.

374
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,989
Dilawar Imtiaz Haksar.

375
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,392
Get inside.

376
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,043
I want you to work for me.

377
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,444
Doing what?

378
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,076
The same thing you
were doing back there.

379
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,519
You mean what the cops
don't have the guts to do.

380
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:49,289
No, I mean, what the
cops aren't permitted to do.

381
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:52,291
I want this city clean...

382
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,191
and for that it's important
to wipe out the Mastan gang.

383
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,333
With that sort of cleaning...

384
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:01,360
the streets of Bombay will be
drenched in blood, not soap water.

385
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:03,867
Will do.

386
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:08,339
The cops won't trouble you,
I can guarantee you that.

387
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,148
I'm impressed.

388
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:21,454
That sounds like Subhash Chandra
Bose's independence slogan...

389
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:25,594
'Give me your blood and
I'll give you your freedom.'

390
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,530
Do you accept?

391
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,000
We'll think about it.

392
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:40,534
Dilawar said, we'll think about it.

393
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,512
You're saying 'Sholay'..

394
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,518
"Transformed Dilawar and
Zubair from a spark to a flame?

395
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,516
'Sholay' did a lot more.

396
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,257
Sadik believed himself to be...

397
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,626
'Thakur' and Dilawar and
Zubair as his 'Jai and Veeru'.

398
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:05,067
Under that presumption...

399
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,365
he published the pictures of
Yakub and Batla in his newspaper.

400
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,068
Walekum, Sadik.

401
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,404
Walekum-a-salaam...

402
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,109
Check out the first page.

403
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:21,143
I can't believe you
published their pictures.

404
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,008
Is that a wise move?

405
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:24,418
It's the truth.

406
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,348
It may not be wise
to speak the truth...

407
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,254
but it's better than
to lie like a coward.

408
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,691
Sometimes cowardice
helps people stay alive.

409
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:36,625
It's heartening to see
the concern in your advice.

410
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:38,092
Here.

411
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:41,035
Well, it's our duty to warn you.

412
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,006
And it's my duty
to publish the facts.

413
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:47,541
As long as you are around,
I have nothing to worry.

414
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,706
Did you meet Bhende?

415
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,547
You recommended us to him?

416
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,684
You want us to work for the cops?

417
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,179
Not at all.

418
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,681
In fact,
the cops will work for you.

419
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,388
Is that so?

420
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:10,456
- Shinde...
- Yes sir.

421
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:13,059
Get the Head Office to send an
arrest warrant for Batla and Yakub.

422
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,296
Bhende, request for
ammunition from the armory.

423
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,361
Keep the force on standby.

424
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:17,634
We have to move fast.

425
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,378
Their pictures and address
are out in the newspaper.

426
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:35,625
We have all the information
except their blood group.

427
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,051
The newspaper has
made our task easy.

428
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,786
The least we can do is arrest them.

429
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:44,600
No cops have ever
entered that area.

430
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:46,033
I know.

431
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:49,534
That's why those scoundrels do what
they want, wherever they want to.

432
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:53,141
I am going there to arrest them.

433
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,502
You are welcome to come along.

434
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,274
We will go in wearing uniforms
and come out in a shroud.

435
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:00,273
Let's tie the shroud on our head.

436
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:06,048
Once we arrest Yakub and Batla, we
can pin the medals on our uniform.

437
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,258
What do you say?

438
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,421
Let's go!

439
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:14,792
Everybody wants to be a hero.

440
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,724
Amitahh Bachchan has
brainwashed everybody!

441
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:38,118
How much? - .50 paise.

442
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:43,191
It can't get easier than this.

443
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,291
He is alone.

444
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,090
A bull may stand alone but...

445
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:49,322
his flock is sure to be around.

446
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:50,523
What?

447
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,133
11 o'clock.

448
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,464
2 o'clock.

449
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:01,310
What's our move?

450
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:02,606
12 to 3 is yours.

451
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,113
Bhende, you take on 3 to 6.

452
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,444
And I will handle 6 to 12.

453
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:08,741
What happened?

454
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,184
Forget it.

455
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:28,368
Yakub...

456
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,674
Your picture doesn't
do you justice.

457
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:36,612
You are more fearsome in real life.

458
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:40,649
Do you have any idea
what you've just said?

459
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,210
How dare you come into
my area and insult me?

460
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,184
Come along quietly or...

461
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:51,190
this picture will be part
of tomorrow's obituary column.

462
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,450
Who are you?

463
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,622
Afaaque Baagraan... - Tea.

464
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:57,165
Inspector Afaaque Baagraan.

465
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:58,495
You are here to take me away?

466
00:35:58,557 --> 00:35:59,399
Yes.

467
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,401
How?

468
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,493
Police van.

469
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:06,698
There's no police van
that can hold Yakub Lala.

470
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:08,605
In that case...

471
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:11,543
I'll call for an ambulance.

472
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,767
Don't move or you're dead.

473
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:40,671
3n!

474
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,248
M ove.

475
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:54,511
M ove.

476
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:57,912
Take him.

477
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:07,053
That was a fabulous sequence.

478
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,292
You should sell
it to a film producer.

479
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,400
Instead of a medal,
you'll get money.

480
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,697
I got something better
than medals and money.

481
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:16,599
Satisfaction.

482
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,470
Satisfaction that Bombay had...

483
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,568
one less scoundrel to fear.

484
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,642
While you arrested one...

485
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:28,551
two more were planning their
escape from Ratnagiri prison.

486
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,919
Manya! Come.

487
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,722
M anyag

488
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:09,509
Mince meat for lunch?

489
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:11,848
You're right!

490
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:15,423
I am sure I have sautéed potato.

491
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,119
What did I tell you?

492
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:18,627
Sautéed potato and okra!

493
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:19,753
I'm tired of this.

494
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:20,829
The okra is good.

495
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:21,897
What do you think you're doing?

496
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,488
- Where's your lunch box?
- I don't have one.

497
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:24,761
Your wife didn't pack
lunch for you today?

498
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,858
She gave nothing!

499
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,065
That's nothing new.

500
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,432
- Hello?
- Your wife cooks mince meat well.

501
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,873
Can't stop licking my fingers.

502
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,445
Didn't she pack that
for your son's lunch?

503
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,641
Who is this?

504
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:41,607
Batla!

505
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,486
Where is my son?

506
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:48,616
He is in school right now.

507
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:51,854
But when they have their
lunch break in 30 minutes...

508
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,925
and your son opens his lunch box...

509
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:56,758
instead of mince meat,
he will get a bomb.

510
00:40:57,021 --> 00:41:00,093
And instead of your son,
you will get mince meat.

511
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:07,498
Am bat, trace this call
and get Batla's location.

512
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,542
Bhende, head to the
school with a squad.

513
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:10,739
QKZY-

514
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,008
Get the car.

515
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,115
Sir!

516
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:52,179
Listen...

517
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,519
check the classrooms on the ground
floor and also check the ground.

518
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:55,684
QKZY-

519
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:34,561
Move it!

520
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,725
Hey... - What?

521
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,379
You do something wrong
and we'll stop you.

522
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,652
You commit a crime
and we'll shoot you.

523
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:37,625
As long as you're around,
so will we.

524
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,657
And this strife will continue...

525
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:45,031
strife will continue.

526
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,703
No, sir...

527
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:53,834
But we never drag our
family into this mess.

528
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,406
You better remember this, Batla.

529
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:01,679
Take him away.

530
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,119
Come on.

531
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:11,190
Let's go. Come on.

532
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:17,798
Listen...

533
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,831
the law doesn't allow
me to grant you this right.

534
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:29,343
But my religion doesn't allow
me to snatch this right from you.

535
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,140
Take this...

536
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,176
Take this...

537
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,680
And do as you wish.

538
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:02,209
You and me aren't very different.

539
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:05,075
Our weakness was our family.

540
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,113
You saved your son...

541
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,716
and were proclaimed a hero.

542
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:14,852
While I saved my brother
and was branded zero.

543
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,384
You could've become a better
person in prison, if you wanted to.

544
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:23,091
But it's more tempting to become
completely ruthless, isn't it?

545
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,428
Second chances are
found only in stories...

546
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:27,936
not real life.

547
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,235
My story was set
in stone the day...

548
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:35,368
that crook Inspector Ambolkar falsely
accused me in the police FIR.

549
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:38,369
Is that why you..

550
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:41,781
...got a string of FIR's
in every police station in Bombay?

551
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:46,347
No, I did something
else before that.

552
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:49,416
Munir...

553
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:52,224
We haven't done anything yet...

554
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:54,126
we haven't even joined a gang.

555
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,189
And this is where you want to be.

556
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:58,267
That's because...

557
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:01,962
over here you don't need to
be married to enjoy the benefits.

558
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:05,538
Hey look, I am that Bruce...

559
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,106
who has practised self
control for 8 long years!

560
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:08,233
At least let me take a look and...

561
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:12,144
find out if my
pistons are in order.

562
00:46:12,804 --> 00:46:14,249
You don't need to check.

563
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:17,249
Weapons catch rust, warriors don't.

564
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:18,785
You're right!

565
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:22,346
Moreover, Romeo's are in
short supply here, not Juliefs!

566
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:29,262
"Only for a day."

567
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:33,331
"For a moment."

568
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:42,809
"I want to be your bride for a day."

569
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:51,152
"I've been waiting for you."

570
00:46:51,976 --> 00:47:01,829
"Let me bathe in this
fragrance of love."

571
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:08,293
"Only for a day."

572
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:25,852
"She'll steal your heart."

573
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,589
"She'll steal your life."

574
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:33,357
"She'll steal your loyalty."

575
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,226
"Laila's gonna.."

576
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:37,095
"Laila's gonna.."

577
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:42,228
"Laila's gonna rob you clean."

578
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:48,271
"Laila's gonna rob you clean."

579
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,973
"She'll take one look at you.“

580
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:55,550
"She'll pierce your heart.“

581
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,512
"She'll take one look at you.“

582
00:47:58,576 --> 00:48:00,385
"She'll pierce your heart.“

583
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:02,651
"She'll change the ambiance."

584
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,091
"Laila's gonna rob you clean."

585
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:14,026
"Laila's gonna rob you clean."

586
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,659
"She makes your heart throb."

587
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:51,496
"Her attitude's unique."

588
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,072
"She can enthrall you."

589
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,576
"Make you unconscious.“

590
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:58,580
"Lovers hover around her."

591
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:02,146
"She can do anything."

592
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:07,280
"Laila's gonna rob you clean."

593
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:12,958
"Laila's gonna rob you clean."

594
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:39,516
"Laila's got intoxicating eyes."

595
00:49:40,044 --> 00:49:43,218
"Her attitude so enthralling."

596
00:49:44,048 --> 00:49:45,686
"She's got a sexy gait."

597
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,558
"She's just awesome."

598
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:50,428
"And that curvy waist.“

599
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,726
"She's not going to spare you."

600
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:59,031
"Laila's gonna rob you clean."

601
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:04,311
"Laila's gonna rob you clean."

602
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:09,516
"She'll steal your heart."

603
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:13,187
"She'll steal your life."

604
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,320
"She'll steal your heart."

605
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:17,017
"She'll steal your life."

606
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:19,527
"She'll steal your loyalty."

607
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:24,723
"Laila's gonna rob you clean."

608
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:30,396
"Laila's gonna rob you clean."

609
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:36,403
"Laila's gonna rob you clean."

610
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,273
Hey...

611
00:50:39,437 --> 00:50:41,417
come with me.

612
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:42,447
Let me go!

613
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,520
- I said, come.
- Leave my hand!

614
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:48,588
Why are you forcing her?

615
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:50,148
She's a prostitute.

616
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:52,590
And a prostitute has
no rights in a brothel.

617
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:58,461
She is a woman too.

618
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,763
And every woman has a right.

619
00:51:03,628 --> 00:51:05,437
Are you her pimp?

620
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,809
Your first mistake
was to grab her hand.

621
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,848
Your second mistake was to hit her.

622
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:21,486
I suggest you don't
make another mistake.

623
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,181
Because if you do,
I'll hit you so much...

624
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:26,558
that your body won't know
which wound hurts the most!

625
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,828
Wm"!

626
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:38,095
Women have been controlling
men right from the Garden of Eden.

627
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,370
An apple is all I asked for and...

628
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:45,307
you threw me out of paradise!

629
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:50,512
One look at the emperor...

630
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:55,156
and the empire changed hands...

631
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,757
What will become of you?

632
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:03,155
The one whose hand you
are holding is my sweetheart.

633
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:06,496
If she is your sweetheart,
she doesn't belong in a brothel.

634
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,429
She deserves a mansion...

635
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:12,272
where people respect
her and not pay to use her!

636
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:18,575
It's not his mistake.

637
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,707
He protected me.

638
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:31,922
Thank you.

639
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:34,294
Hold on.

640
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:39,858
I can't accept your money.

641
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,294
Let me know if you
have any work for me.

642
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:43,427
Fine.

643
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:44,802
Come to Mohammad Ali Road tomorrow.

644
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:46,307
Where at Mohammad Ali Road?

645
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,310
You don't enter an empire
and ask for the emperor's address.

646
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:00,519
The lowered heads of the slaves
will lead you on the right path.

647
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,620
Allah-hafiz!

648
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:12,660
Salaam-walekum...

649
00:53:12,723 --> 00:53:14,532
I am Sheikh Mohammed Yunus Munir.

650
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:17,536
Born in Bhiwandi, that's where
I grew up and earned my notoriety.

651
00:53:17,728 --> 00:53:19,605
At the age of 11 I committed
my first robbery and...

652
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:21,936
at the age of 13 I went
to prison for the first time.

653
00:53:22,266 --> 00:53:24,246
As soon as I turned 18,
I was sentenced for 8 years.

654
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,440
That's enough!

655
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:28,910
You are going to ask for work,
not for your dad's dowry!

656
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:31,249
Jerk!
Either way, I have to ask.

657
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:34,551
And I request you not
to create any trouble.

658
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,586
Also button up your shirt,
don't try to be a stud!

659
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:53,469
Salaam-walekum, bhai.

660
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:54,406
Walekum.

661
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:56,706
I am Sheikh Mohammed Yunus Munir.

662
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,743
Born in Bhiwandi, that's where
I grew up and earned my notoriety.

663
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:02,874
At the age of 11 I committed
my first robbery and...

664
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,977
at the age of 13 I went
to prison for the first time.

665
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:06,448
What can you do?

666
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,648
Whatever you want me to.

667
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:11,887
Kidnapping,
arson, robbery, murder, rape...

668
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:13,551
if the girl is pretty.

669
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:19,690
What can you do?

670
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,862
A human body has 206 bones"

671
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,030
"and the Indian constitution
defines 1670 laws.

672
00:54:24,895 --> 00:54:27,501
I break everything
from bones to laws.

673
00:54:27,565 --> 00:54:29,408
Crops...

674
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:33,841
Rain helps crops grow, not thunder.

675
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:37,280
If I wanted to grow crops,
I'd till the land in a village...

676
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:38,920
I wouldn't come to
the city to use a gun.

677
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,687
That's the way he talks.

678
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,485
We just want to work with you.

679
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,428
Dilawar..

680
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:49,862
But you sure use your mouth a lot.

681
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:51,490
It's better than licking
someone's behind!

682
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:02,038
This is my brother, Dilawar.

683
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:07,883
Don't stare at him or
raise your voice with him.

684
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,545
Get it?

685
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:13,350
What?

686
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:15,717
What?

687
00:55:16,547 --> 00:55:19,027
If today weren't the
first day of Ramadan...

688
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:22,764
we'd sell your flesh
at the abattoir!

689
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:25,364
Talk some sense into him.

690
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,592
It's your territory.

691
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:29,568
Every lion has a territory.

692
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:30,900
Hey!

693
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:39,708
Not just this territory.

694
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:42,577
You can go anywhere in Bombay...

695
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,744
there's only one lion...

696
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:47,116
Zubair Imtiaz Haksar.

697
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,891
Take your friend and go away.

698
00:55:51,048 --> 00:55:52,959
Don't you ever come back.

699
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:54,961
I will.

700
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,359
And the day I come back...

701
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,660
the jungle will be the same...

702
00:55:58,388 --> 00:55:59,799
but a different lion.

703
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,036
Manya...let's go..

704
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:22,547
I warned you not
to create any trouble.

705
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,159
Now we are doomed.

706
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:27,123
No other gang in Bombay
will ever hire us.

707
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,395
I don't want to
join someone's gang.

708
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:30,794
I will start my own gang.

709
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:31,992
Sounds like a plan but...

710
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:33,727
two people don't make a gang.

711
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,971
Who do we take on?

712
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:42,539
Here you go.
- Thank you, madam. - Okay.

713
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:46,775
Ladies and gentlemen,
today you can beat this wrestler.

714
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,140
Five rupees!

715
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:51,147
For five rupees you get five
minutes to vent your anger on him.

716
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:54,482
Had a tough morning with your wife?

717
00:56:54,645 --> 00:56:56,989
The boss chew your brains all day?

718
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,859
Rising inflation eating your wages?

719
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:04,829
Your wife trying
to seduce your neighbor?

720
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:07,059
Worried your salary
will never be enough?

721
00:57:07,124 --> 00:57:10,537
This is your chance
to vent your anger!

722
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:11,935
Come on!

723
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:18,644
Time up... That's it!

724
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:26,847
You are ours for
the next 10 minutes.

725
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,580
What are you doing here?

726
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:30,957
We want to recruit you in our gang.

727
00:57:31,715 --> 00:57:33,661
If I join you,
I won't be alive for long.

728
00:57:33,717 --> 00:57:35,697
You jerk, you call this life?

729
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:38,198
You were better off in prison.

730
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,763
At least you commanded respect.

731
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:41,962
Don't you raise your hand.

732
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,470
We paid the kid.

733
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:45,471
Listen, Veera...

734
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:48,868
I can't guarantee that
you will have a respectable life.

735
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:51,872
But I assure, you will
be respected as long as you live.

736
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:53,942
What do you say?

737
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,607
I am not as learned as you are.

738
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,549
But life has taught me that.

739
00:57:57,608 --> 00:58:00,555
"Friends and opportunities
don't come by often.

740
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:05,251
Why did you hit me?

741
00:58:05,516 --> 00:58:06,927
Your time is up!

742
00:58:12,556 --> 00:58:14,866
This is Gyancho, a shooter.

743
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:17,967
Is that really your name?

744
00:58:23,534 --> 00:58:25,844
I was kidding... sit.

745
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:30,607
What will you have?

746
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:31,982
Milk?

747
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,152
Ice cream?

748
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,117
Veera, get some
ice cream for the kid.

749
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:43,592
Very funny!

750
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:45,562
Now can we get down to business?

751
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:46,829
Business?

752
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:49,935
So, instead of playing with marbles,
you're playing with bullets.

753
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:52,971
Enough!

754
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,176
- Or else...
- Or else what?

755
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,575
You'll go to your mom and cry?

756
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:01,748
I'll shoot you!

757
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:07,113
You jerk, you'll shoot me?

758
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:11,049
If you act smart, you won't be
left with any marbles at all! Punk!

759
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:12,650
Son-of-a..

760
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:17,998
Talk about being childish!

761
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:22,993
Learn to handle the weapon
before you learn to shoot.

762
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:26,334
Otherwise it may go
off at the wrong place.

763
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:31,812
Now that you think I'm a child...

764
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:34,046
do you want to see what I can do?

765
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,944
You are so full of yourself!

766
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,177
Yes, I am.

767
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:39,981
Because every bullet
fired from my gun...

768
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,121
salutes my marksmanship...

769
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,987
before taking out my mark!

770
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,721
Quay»-

771
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,764
Veera, give me a grape.

772
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:57,333
Here.

773
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,103
Let's see what you can do.

774
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:09,082
Manya, are you crazy?

775
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:10,641
What if he misses?

776
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:11,879
You'll never know.

777
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:13,313
You brought him, didn't you?

778
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,083
Now it's either you or the grape.

779
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:19,958
Veera, why didn't you
get a watermelon today?!

780
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:24,063
Not from here... from there.
- Manya..

781
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:26,227
Manya, we want a shooter.

782
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,701
Not an Olympic gold medalist...

783
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:28,996
Right?

784
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,830
Take it easy, you jerk!

785
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,379
Now that was a first.

786
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,143
Grape blows up there and
the juice flows down there!

787
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,856
Get in. Get in.

788
01:00:55,285 --> 01:00:57,356
Don't move.

789
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,898
Get down.

790
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,107
You too. Come on.

791
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:08,666
Hand over the money.

792
01:01:12,302 --> 01:01:15,715
Don't move or I'll shoot.

793
01:01:16,707 --> 01:01:18,414
Quiet!

794
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,086
Let's go, Manya,

795
01:01:58,782 --> 01:02:00,819
I've told you a million times...

796
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:02,989
Bhatkar Dada rules
over Agar Bazaar area.

797
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:06,099
And only he can demand
a share from the sales.

798
01:02:06,156 --> 01:02:07,396
Yet you've come back!

799
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:09,869
What's your answer to Manya Surve?

800
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:12,965
You want an answer for Manya Surve?

801
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:14,440
You want an answer?

802
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:17,835
Here...

803
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:22,507
Come on!

804
01:02:49,032 --> 01:02:51,808
Now who the hell are you?

805
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:54,344
Manohar Arjun Surve.

806
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:58,250
Manya Surve.

807
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:11,088
Did you just piss in your pants?

808
01:03:12,055 --> 01:03:14,899
From now on every
time you hear my name...

809
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,233
you will pee in fear!

810
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:19,240
I will pay you every week.

811
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:21,173
I swear... I will.

812
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:23,809
Look what's written.

813
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,278
What are you reading?

814
01:03:25,335 --> 01:03:28,316
The article says Pappu
Patil is terrified and...

815
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:32,214
has refused to divulge
the name of the assailant.

816
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:35,548
According to sources
it was Manya Surve.

817
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,189
His terror has been spreading"

818
01:03:37,247 --> 01:03:40,592
...all over Dadar and
Agar Bazaar like wildfire.

819
01:04:14,384 --> 01:04:16,625
So tell me...

820
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:17,991
what do you want to talk about?

821
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,624
We've heard that
you don't have children.

822
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:20,994
Yeah.

823
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:22,934
Hence, we've found an heir for you.

824
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:24,294
Really?

825
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:27,570
Starting today 50 % of your illegal
earnings belong to Manya Surve.

826
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:31,977
When you retire in a few years,
he will take over everything.

827
01:04:34,304 --> 01:04:39,310
Some years ago a cockroach like
you stepped up to become the don.

828
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:43,322
I gave him the same
example but he ignored it.

829
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,087
And he was squashed.

830
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:46,923
What was his name...

831
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,463
Surve... Bhargav Surve.

832
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:55,535
M oreover...

833
01:04:56,259 --> 01:05:01,265
I even got Ambolkar to arrest his
younger brother under section 302.

834
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,236
I had them killed in prison.

835
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:06,905
That was the end of them.

836
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:41,115
If you had given us our share,
instead of narrating this tale...

837
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:43,011
your story wouldn't end today.

838
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:44,478
What do you mean?

839
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:46,953
I guess you didn't hear my name.

840
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:50,016
Manya Surve.

841
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,360
Bhargav Surve's younger brother.

842
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:59,332
You're going to kill
me here in this market?

843
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:16,244
What about him?

844
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:18,519
- What's your name?
- Jamaal.

845
01:06:18,575 --> 01:06:20,054
You want to work?

846
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:21,547
Yeah.

847
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:23,249
What did you do for him?

848
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:24,986
I was his bodyguard.

849
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:29,186
Come.

850
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:31,095
Now you have to guard our bodies!

851
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,292
Tell me something...

852
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:33,698
what does your name mean?

853
01:06:33,757 --> 01:06:35,998
Gyancho means someone
who is very intelligent.

854
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:39,198
What can you teach us today?

855
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:41,242
So, my teaching for today.

856
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:45,478
A man's world revolves
around his girl.

857
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,312
And there are three
chapters to every girl.

858
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,109
Chapter one...

859
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,050
When you are trying to charm her..

860
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:55,079
...you sing Kishore
Kumar's love songs.

861
01:06:55,245 --> 01:06:57,486
"The beautiful evening...“

862
01:06:57,547 --> 01:06:59,220
"Close to my heart." - Correct.

863
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:02,125
You charm her and
you start seeing her.

864
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:03,459
Chapter two...

865
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,464
Sing songs by Rafi.

866
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:07,730
When you've already charmed her,
why do you need Raft's songs?

867
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:10,635
Idiot! Don't you
want some excitement?

868
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:16,034
Raft's super romantic
songs are perfect for that.

869
01:07:16,066 --> 01:07:20,037
"I can never forget."

870
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:22,379
"The moments spent together"

871
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:25,552
What's the third chapter?

872
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:27,645
Chapter threemSongs by Mukesh.

873
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:33,221
When the girl breaks your
heart and leaves you all alone...

874
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,726
Mukesh's soulful songs are like..

875
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:38,391
...a balm that will
soothe your heartbreak.

876
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:42,768
And then?

877
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,129
What else?

878
01:07:44,194 --> 01:07:46,800
Start with Kishore all
over again... and a new girl.

879
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:48,803
And romance will blossom one again.

880
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:52,274
The 'Kishore,
Rafi, Mukesh' cycle keeps turning.

881
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:55,145
Rascals!

882
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:57,307
Waiter.

883
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,845
- Yes sir.
- What the hell is this?

884
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,589
How can they use such language?

885
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:03,419
Cheers!

886
01:08:04,114 --> 01:08:05,354
Excuse me, sir...

887
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:07,292
please don't use such language.

888
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,225
The other guests are complaining.

889
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:10,662
Brilliant!

890
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,198
It's acceptable if he
says 'f**"' in English...

891
01:08:13,356 --> 01:08:16,132
But he has a problem,
if we use a cuss word in Hindi?

892
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:19,364
Tell that English speaking idiot,
'Be Indian, Abuse Indian'.

893
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:20,874
Now get lost!

894
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:22,801
Some people have
nothing better to do.

895
01:08:22,866 --> 01:08:25,346
Excuse me gentlemen,
is there a problem?

896
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,243
I'm the manager here. - What the..

897
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:36,418
Sorry, madam, we were only kidding.

898
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:39,388
Enjoy your meal.

899
01:08:59,436 --> 01:09:02,610
"He? Ma"Ya--"

900
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:06,820
"Listen Manya.“

901
01:09:07,911 --> 01:09:10,824
"He? Ma"Ya--"

902
01:09:11,448 --> 01:09:15,294
"Listen Manya.“

903
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:23,663
"Let the booze flow."

904
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:33,180
"Just live your life."

905
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:36,774
"He? Ma"Ya--"

906
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:41,689
"Listen Manya.“

907
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:45,723
"He? Ma"Ya--"

908
01:09:46,216 --> 01:09:50,722
"Listen Manya.“

909
01:10:11,808 --> 01:10:18,851
"Wonder where I lost track of life."

910
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:26,924
"All my dreams were shattered."

911
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:36,538
"The wind drifted us apart."

912
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:44,883
"We danced to the tunes of fate."

913
01:10:46,376 --> 01:10:53,385
"The intoxication soothes my pain."

914
01:10:54,951 --> 01:11:03,302
"Let the booze flow."

915
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:06,865
"He? Ma"Ya--"

916
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:11,410
"Listen Manya.“

917
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:18,943
"Let the booze flow."

918
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:28,522
"Let the booze flow."

919
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:33,925
"Just live your life."

920
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:37,865
After returning to Bombay
didn't you meet your mother?

921
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:40,931
If I had been released from prison,
I would have.

922
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,503
But when you escape from prison"

923
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:44,511
...you don't find your
mother on that path.

924
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:47,341
A mother always
forgives her children.

925
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,081
She would've forgiven you.

926
01:11:50,373 --> 01:11:52,353
No, she wouldn't...

927
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:54,945
because I was her last hope.

928
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,314
Now she had given
up on that hope too.

929
01:11:58,381 --> 01:12:02,056
So you lost your
sweetheart and your mother.

930
01:12:02,852 --> 01:12:04,422
No...

931
01:12:04,754 --> 01:12:07,325
my sweetheart was
waiting to be found.

932
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:23,114
"I felt so lifeless."

933
01:12:24,107 --> 01:12:31,685
"without you."

934
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:41,764
"Now we're happy,
let there be no pain."

935
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:49,402
"Only love. Only love."

936
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:56,949
"Where will my passion take me?"

937
01:12:57,774 --> 01:13:03,588
"I feel alive now.."

938
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:05,157
When did you start coming here?

939
01:13:05,415 --> 01:13:06,860
When you couldn't make it anymore.

940
01:13:06,983 --> 01:13:08,894
I've heard your prayers
are answered at this temple.

941
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:11,064
Now I believe it's true.

942
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:14,663
I had lost hope of seeing you here.

943
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,169
You have a habit of...

944
01:13:17,927 --> 01:13:19,702
giving up too soon.

945
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:24,100
While you have a habit of fighting.

946
01:13:24,534 --> 01:13:26,707
You fight when someone hurts you.

947
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:30,711
And it hurts when you love someone.

948
01:13:32,175 --> 01:13:36,715
I've heard that it hurts
less as time passes by.

949
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,091
That's a lie.

950
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:40,890
The pain in my heart
hasn't gone away..

951
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:42,930
...since the day you
married someone else.

952
01:13:43,186 --> 01:13:46,998
What if I tell you that even after
a year I still yearned for you...

953
01:13:47,857 --> 01:13:50,633
would that reduce your pain?

954
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:52,067
And after that?

955
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:55,005
Well, my parents
stopped nagging me..

956
01:13:55,064 --> 01:13:56,600
"And I didn't have
to say 'yes' anymore.

957
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:59,579
"I felt lost after we separated."

958
01:14:00,036 --> 01:14:06,783
"Don't ever leave me again."

959
01:14:08,478 --> 01:14:15,862
"Take me in your arms."

960
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:23,568
"Don't ever shatter my dreams.“

961
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:31,802
"Now that we're together."

962
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:37,049
"Let there be no sorrows. Only love."

963
01:14:37,507 --> 01:14:45,551
"Come closer, my fate.“

964
01:14:45,715 --> 01:14:52,599
"That's what I pray for."

965
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:58,029
"My heart says.."

966
01:14:58,094 --> 01:15:02,133
"..I want to be yours."

967
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:05,202
"That's my prayer."

968
01:15:05,268 --> 01:15:09,808
"That's my prayer."

969
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:16,084
"Where will my passion take me?"

970
01:15:16,145 --> 01:15:21,145
"I feel alive now in your eyes."

971
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:36,042
"The sky cried along with me."

972
01:15:44,774 --> 01:15:47,277
Hey... I want four boxes.

973
01:15:53,316 --> 01:15:56,593
Ambolkar... remember me?

974
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:59,992
Are you a Bollywood
star that I should know you?

975
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:04,068
Manohar Arjun Surve.

976
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:04,831
Okay?

977
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:07,738
Remember Bhargav Surve?

978
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:10,233
College test results...

979
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,604
section 302...

980
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:16,149
Bhatkar's bribe...

981
01:16:16,706 --> 01:16:18,811
of course!

982
01:16:19,609 --> 01:16:20,986
When did you get out of prison?

983
01:16:21,177 --> 01:16:23,783
I escaped.

984
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:28,790
Now you want to fight with a cop?

985
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:33,628
I've been fighting with
every cop because of you.

986
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:36,602
All cops are scoundrels!

987
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:09,336
Remember what you had said?

988
01:17:09,392 --> 01:17:11,668
You said,
'my mother made a mistake, not me'.

989
01:17:12,228 --> 01:17:17,837
Now you will regret why your
father ever slept with your mother!

990
01:17:23,206 --> 01:17:25,277
I have a family...
please forgive me.

991
01:17:27,043 --> 01:17:28,113
Why?

992
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:31,886
You had said, your family
knows you are a scoundrel.

993
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:36,787
It won't make a
difference to your family.

994
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:56,140
You enjoyed bringing the
Bombay police down on it's knees.

995
01:18:57,266 --> 01:19:01,476
And today your
knees have given way.

996
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:05,751
What are you looking at?

997
01:19:07,977 --> 01:19:09,251
Your watch.

998
01:19:11,347 --> 01:19:14,794
It's a cheap HMT watch.
Not a Rolex gifted by a don.

999
01:19:15,051 --> 01:19:17,053
How does it matter, officer?

1000
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:19,061
Both display the time...

1001
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:21,832
but yours is also
displaying your intention.

1002
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:23,431
What do you mean?

1003
01:19:24,827 --> 01:19:29,173
When you got into this vehicle,
it was five past two.

1004
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,836
Now it's 3 o'clock.

1005
01:19:32,902 --> 01:19:36,816
It takes 10 to 12 minutes to drive
from Wadala College to Sion Hospital.

1006
01:19:37,173 --> 01:19:39,084
And 15 minutes if
we're caught in traffic.

1007
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:43,546
You've been driving
around in circles...

1008
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:49,025
hoping that time will do
the job your bullets failed to do.

1009
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:54,867
But I won't die so easily.

1010
01:20:52,315 --> 01:20:55,956
If I can fire 10 bullets
at you in a crowded area...

1011
01:20:56,318 --> 01:21:00,095
I can easily fire one bullet
through your head when we're alone.

1012
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,628
You are still breathing as
these wheels are turning because...

1013
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:06,066
I am interested in your story.

1014
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:08,899
And I want to know
what happened next.

1015
01:21:09,265 --> 01:21:11,302
It's in your interest
to keep talking"

1016
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:13,438
"and don't try to change the end.

1017
01:21:15,905 --> 01:21:18,351
You will die, Manya because...

1018
01:21:19,408 --> 01:21:22,548
while you were alive you made life
hell for the police force and...

1019
01:21:22,912 --> 01:21:25,017
even God's mercy
can't save you today.

1020
01:21:46,969 --> 01:21:48,915
This place is awesome.

1021
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:51,278
Imagine all the hot girls...

1022
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:52,944
It doesn't matter...

1023
01:21:53,008 --> 01:21:57,013
Once the lights go off, all girls are
Hema Malini and I am Shah Jahan!

1024
01:21:57,313 --> 01:22:00,021
Shah Jahan was an idiot
to build the Taj Mahal.

1025
01:22:00,216 --> 01:22:01,559
What would you have built?

1026
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:03,596
- The Qutub Minar!
- Why?

1027
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:08,258
Because it's tall and it's been
standing erect for all these years!

1028
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,365
This table is reserved.

1029
01:22:13,329 --> 01:22:14,467
Is it still reserved?

1030
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:15,508
No, sir. Sorry.

1031
01:22:15,564 --> 01:22:17,703
- For whom is it reserved?
- For Zubair.

1032
01:22:20,236 --> 01:22:24,116
For 365 days a year, this table,
just like the rest of the city is...

1033
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:26,585
reserved for it's rightful owner.

1034
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:33,258
Dogs mark their territory
by pissing around the place...

1035
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:36,495
since when do lions do the same?

1036
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:39,023
You're funny.

1037
01:22:39,188 --> 01:22:42,658
Instead of becoming a don,
I suggest you become a clown.

1038
01:22:44,093 --> 01:22:50,669
Do you think if you hire
local goons and get rid of a cop...

1039
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,373
you own this table?

1040
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,346
Of course I do!

1041
01:22:56,405 --> 01:22:59,113
This table and this city.

1042
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:03,418
I guess you don't know the difference
between owner and gatekeeper.

1043
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,152
- Son-of-a--
- No...

1044
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,460
today is the festival
of Gudi Padwa and...

1045
01:23:11,687 --> 01:23:14,429
on this day we don't
get into a fight.

1046
01:23:15,558 --> 01:23:17,629
Moreover,
I am grateful to your brother.

1047
01:23:18,627 --> 01:23:21,699
If he hadn't hit me back then...

1048
01:23:21,764 --> 01:23:23,744
today I would've been
standing behind you.

1049
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:29,141
You'd stand behind
me and stab my back.

1050
01:23:29,472 --> 01:23:33,249
The day I attack,
I'll make sure I stab your chest!

1051
01:23:34,476 --> 01:23:36,183
In that case, I'll pray..

1052
01:23:36,245 --> 01:23:39,556
...that it's neither Ramadan
nor Gudi Padwa that day.

1053
01:23:40,282 --> 01:23:44,526
So you can neither run nor hide.

1054
01:23:45,087 --> 01:23:50,059
We'll know that day as
to who runs and who hides.

1055
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,688
- Your drink?
- I don't drink.

1056
01:24:12,748 --> 01:24:14,386
He only has tea.

1057
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:17,463
Why didn't you bring
your family along?

1058
01:24:17,653 --> 01:24:20,532
My wife went to her mother's
place and took Salman along.

1059
01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:22,600
You are a lucky guy, Afaaque.

1060
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:25,672
I mean, I often tell Suman to visit
her mother, but she never goes

1061
01:24:26,195 --> 01:24:28,835
Though her mother
visits every 15 days.

1062
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:33,837
You'll catch up
while I heat the food.

1063
01:24:35,137 --> 01:24:36,343
Did you read today's newspaper?

1064
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:37,475
Yes.

1065
01:24:38,307 --> 01:24:39,547
All of us knew...

1066
01:24:40,309 --> 01:24:42,516
that Amholkar had it coming.

1067
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:44,781
I have no problem
with him being thrashed.

1068
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:49,185
It would make no difference
to me even if he were killed.

1069
01:24:53,389 --> 01:24:54,732
Then...

1070
01:24:56,158 --> 01:24:57,102
what is the problem?

1071
01:24:57,159 --> 01:24:59,298
The problem is he
was wearing the uniform.

1072
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:01,802
Whether the uniform is
of an army officer or a cop...

1073
01:25:02,565 --> 01:25:06,513
it assures the people that their
country... their city is safe.

1074
01:25:06,702 --> 01:25:11,412
But when a local goon thrashes a
cop on duty in front of a crowd...

1075
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:14,481
it's all of us who get thrashed.

1076
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:18,682
The public trusts
the uniform, not us.

1077
01:25:18,814 --> 01:25:20,452
You think the public
trusts the uniform?

1078
01:25:20,716 --> 01:25:23,663
Police officers
themselves don't trust it.

1079
01:25:24,153 --> 01:25:25,223
Take Ambolkar for example.

1080
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:28,234
He is so terrified by Manya that he
has refused to lodge a complaint.

1081
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:30,563
He went to the police
headquarters dressed in a veil..

1082
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,230
...to apply for a transfer.

1083
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:35,275
It seems he wants to go as
far away from Bombay as possible.

1084
01:25:35,497 --> 01:25:37,499
What do you have to say about that?

1085
01:25:38,734 --> 01:25:40,611
All I am saying is,
what's happening is not good.

1086
01:25:40,836 --> 01:25:44,215
With a gun in hand,
even a eunuch pretends to be a man.

1087
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:47,649
And a goon with a
gun thinks he is God.

1088
01:25:47,709 --> 01:25:48,779
Come on!

1089
01:25:49,778 --> 01:25:51,724
Don't think so much about Manya.

1090
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:55,162
He is a small time goon,
and soon he will die a dog's death.

1091
01:25:58,687 --> 01:26:01,759
Just because a match-stick is in
a match-box, people think it is...

1092
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:03,531
only used to light a cigarette.

1093
01:26:04,593 --> 01:26:08,803
But we shouldn't forget that
the same spark when fanned by...

1094
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:10,742
a breeze can engulf a pyre.

1095
01:26:11,233 --> 01:26:13,440
Let them burn each other's pyre!

1096
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:16,507
We will warm our
hands in it's heat.

1097
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:06,327
"Test me."

1098
01:27:07,256 --> 01:27:11,227
"Come face me."

1099
01:27:12,294 --> 01:27:16,299
"Test me."

1100
01:27:16,865 --> 01:27:20,472
"Come face me."

1101
01:27:20,669 --> 01:27:22,410
"My heart's open."

1102
01:27:22,471 --> 01:27:24,542
"You're such a flirt."

1103
01:27:24,606 --> 01:27:28,452
"Don't be so innocent.“

1104
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:32,322
"Babli's naughty-".

1105
01:27:32,381 --> 01:27:36,261
"Babli's naughty-".

1106
01:27:36,285 --> 01:27:39,755
"Babli's naughty-".

1107
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:41,858
"Don't be so innocent.“

1108
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:44,597
"Babli's naughty-".

1109
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:14,060
"I've been craving for so long."

1110
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:21,906
"Let's douse these emotions.“

1111
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:29,647
"I've been craving for so long."

1112
01:28:29,705 --> 01:28:33,448
"Let's douse these emotions.“

1113
01:28:33,608 --> 01:28:37,351
"No time to breathe."

1114
01:28:37,413 --> 01:28:41,919
"Just the will to give love."

1115
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:47,363
"Put your heart on fire."

1116
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:51,860
"Come face me."

1117
01:28:53,629 --> 01:28:55,575
"My heart's open."

1118
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:57,541
"You're such a flirt."

1119
01:28:57,599 --> 01:29:01,445
"Don't be so innocent.“

1120
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:05,349
"Babli's naughty-".

1121
01:29:05,407 --> 01:29:09,082
"Babli's naughty-".

1122
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:12,723
"Babli's naughty-".

1123
01:29:12,781 --> 01:29:17,423
"Babli's naughty-".

1124
01:29:41,777 --> 01:29:42,915
M anohar.-.

1125
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:44,385
What's this?

1126
01:29:44,513 --> 01:29:45,685
You escaped from prison?

1127
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:48,853
No, I've returned
from a pilgrimage.

1128
01:29:50,419 --> 01:29:51,898
I've been sentenced for life.

1129
01:29:52,788 --> 01:29:56,065
If I hadn't escaped
I'd be rotting inside.

1130
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:59,004
This newspaper says you're
Bombay's most dangerous gangster.

1131
01:29:59,061 --> 01:30:00,404
That's wrong.

1132
01:30:00,929 --> 01:30:02,499
I am...

1133
01:30:03,765 --> 01:30:06,541
the don of Bombay.

1134
01:30:07,636 --> 01:30:09,047
What's gotten into you?

1135
01:30:09,104 --> 01:30:11,948
I can't believe you are
the Manohar I was in love with.

1136
01:30:12,007 --> 01:30:13,953
That Manohar is dead!

1137
01:30:14,643 --> 01:30:17,180
Have you ever seen the
ECG machine in a hospital?

1138
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:21,193
A slant in the stripe
means the person is alive.

1139
01:30:22,017 --> 01:30:25,157
A straight stripe means he is dead.

1140
01:30:27,189 --> 01:30:30,500
The old Manohar was straight,
so he died.

1141
01:30:30,959 --> 01:30:33,803
The new one is not
and that's why he is alive.

1142
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:37,440
The old Manohar
was weak and naive...

1143
01:30:37,499 --> 01:30:39,479
and the new one
is strong and shrewd.

1144
01:30:40,869 --> 01:30:43,816
He was innocent
yet he was imprisoned.

1145
01:30:44,072 --> 01:30:46,985
The new one is guilty
yet he roams freely.

1146
01:30:47,576 --> 01:30:49,783
The old one was afraid
of copying in a test...

1147
01:30:50,012 --> 01:30:52,959
while the world is
afraid of the new one!

1148
01:30:53,849 --> 01:30:55,590
I am not afraid, Manohar.

1149
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:58,722
And if you don't give this up,
I go away.

1150
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:00,956
Just like you did before?

1151
01:31:03,025 --> 01:31:04,504
Where will you go?

1152
01:31:04,993 --> 01:31:07,234
Whether a woman is a
widow or someone's wife...

1153
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:10,803
there are thousands of
creeps waiting to pounce on her.

1154
01:31:12,534 --> 01:31:16,539
If you are with me,
no one will dare touch you.

1155
01:31:16,705 --> 01:31:17,740
Get it?

1156
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:19,012
But you will touch me.

1157
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:22,553
And there's no difference
between you and the others.

1158
01:31:22,844 --> 01:31:24,517
I find you disgusting.

1159
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:26,191
What the--

1160
01:31:35,924 --> 01:31:40,532
You think there
is a dearth of women?

1161
01:31:41,263 --> 01:31:44,676
One word and they will do as I say.

1162
01:32:00,582 --> 01:32:02,186
- How is Sadik doing?
- He is critical.

1163
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:03,194
Did he give a statement?

1164
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:05,788
He won't talk to us but
he is talking to those jerks.

1165
01:32:58,707 --> 01:32:59,947
Afaaque.

1166
01:33:03,612 --> 01:33:04,920
What did Sadik say?

1167
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:06,254
Why?

1168
01:33:07,282 --> 01:33:08,920
You want to take his statement?

1169
01:33:09,885 --> 01:33:11,091
Then what?

1170
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,059
Another arrest?
Just like you did before?

1171
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:16,760
How did that help?

1172
01:33:17,793 --> 01:33:21,639
They were released
on bail in 10 days..

1173
01:33:21,696 --> 01:33:23,642
"And this is what
they did to Sadik.

1174
01:33:24,633 --> 01:33:26,237
I understand your anger, Zubair.

1175
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:29,781
That's why I am
tolerating your tone.

1176
01:33:30,705 --> 01:33:32,309
But mistake my tolerance
as my weakness.

1177
01:33:32,374 --> 01:33:36,686
Not just weak,
the police force is worthless.

1178
01:33:37,045 --> 01:33:40,219
You have guns but they
are loaded with blanks.

1179
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:41,793
Hey...!

1180
01:33:42,183 --> 01:33:44,925
The bullets in a cop's
gun are solid iron!

1181
01:33:45,053 --> 01:33:47,226
Once you're shot.

1182
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:49,928
...you'll never complain of iron
deficiency as long as you're alive.

1183
01:33:49,991 --> 01:33:53,268
Well then go after Batla and Lala.

1184
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:55,665
Your words mean nothing to me.

1185
01:33:55,964 --> 01:33:58,001
Now we will take
charge of the situation.

1186
01:33:58,233 --> 01:34:00,713
Natik was like a father figure.

1187
01:34:01,002 --> 01:34:05,417
To avenge his death, we will torture
Mastan's gang like never before.

1188
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:07,151
Take him away...

1189
01:34:07,275 --> 01:34:09,915
or you will lose him,
just like you lost Sadik.

1190
01:34:10,112 --> 01:34:11,386
Yeah.

1191
01:34:12,914 --> 01:34:16,123
Be prepared to receive two corpses!

1192
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:18,059
Let's go.

1193
01:34:19,421 --> 01:34:23,836
If you do anything rash,
those corpses will be yours.

1194
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:01,105
Forgive me, Dilawar.

1195
01:35:01,763 --> 01:35:05,370
Mistakes can be forgiven, not sins.

1196
01:35:05,834 --> 01:35:08,110
And that sin was your last mistake.

1197
01:35:09,771 --> 01:35:11,045
Kill him.

1198
01:35:25,353 --> 01:35:26,855
Am bat...

1199
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,765
This tea is so refreshing!

1200
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:33,069
You are unbelievable.

1201
01:35:33,128 --> 01:35:34,232
You are still sitting here.

1202
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:36,775
It's general knowledge...

1203
01:35:36,965 --> 01:35:40,378
the police is always late in arriving,
so we thought we'd wait here.

1204
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:41,941
Get in the car.

1205
01:35:42,037 --> 01:35:43,778
Do you have a warrant?

1206
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:45,949
Or a witness?

1207
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:48,485
The entire neighborhood
has witnessed your act.

1208
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:50,313
You're standing on a bird's nest.

1209
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:54,192
These witnesses are like
Gandhi's three monkeys but...

1210
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:57,054
they are loyal to us.

1211
01:35:57,385 --> 01:35:59,387
They don't hear
anything against us...

1212
01:35:59,454 --> 01:36:01,024
they don't see...

1213
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:02,329
they don't speak.

1214
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:04,233
You want witnesses?

1215
01:36:05,226 --> 01:36:07,467
They will come to you.

1216
01:36:08,396 --> 01:36:09,807
Trust me.

1217
01:36:21,543 --> 01:36:22,988
What the--

1218
01:36:24,078 --> 01:36:25,523
Boss"

1219
01:36:31,319 --> 01:36:32,923
Dilawar...

1220
01:36:34,022 --> 01:36:36,002
Don't worry, Batla.

1221
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:40,201
We aren't kind enough
to give you an easy death.

1222
01:36:41,062 --> 01:36:43,406
The more we make you suffer...

1223
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:48,003
the better Sadik's soul will rest.

1224
01:37:45,426 --> 01:37:48,236
Have you ever seen a headless hen?

1225
01:37:48,296 --> 01:37:50,572
Have you seen it run around?

1226
01:37:51,099 --> 01:37:54,273
The body just can't realize
that its head is cut off.

1227
01:37:55,303 --> 01:37:59,080
You will run to Pydhonie Police
station like a headless hen...

1228
01:38:00,174 --> 01:38:02,916
and confess to all your crimes.

1229
01:38:06,448 --> 01:38:08,257
Sir...

1230
01:38:08,416 --> 01:38:10,089
Sir, please arrest me.

1231
01:38:10,184 --> 01:38:11,663
Arrest me!

1232
01:38:12,053 --> 01:38:14,499
I confess to all my crimes.

1233
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:18,302
I am responsible for the
Chawla Guest House incident...

1234
01:38:18,993 --> 01:38:20,597
I killed Sadik...

1235
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:24,001
I also killed Yakub...

1236
01:38:24,165 --> 01:38:25,371
Who cut your hands?

1237
01:38:25,433 --> 01:38:27,936
I cut my own hands!

1238
01:38:28,236 --> 01:38:32,275
You can charge me under any section
you want, but please arrest me!

1239
01:38:32,473 --> 01:38:33,577
Just arrest me.

1240
01:38:33,641 --> 01:38:35,086
Move it.

1241
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:37,515
Arrest me...

1242
01:38:44,118 --> 01:38:45,119
Hello, sir.

1243
01:38:45,219 --> 01:38:46,061
What's the latest?

1244
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:47,463
I've got solid information.

1245
01:38:47,622 --> 01:38:49,226
Today the underworld
in Bombay will witness.

1246
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:51,463
...something that's
never happened before.

1247
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:53,036
Truce!

1248
01:38:53,161 --> 01:38:55,437
Truce between Mastan
and the Haksar brothers.

1249
01:38:57,031 --> 01:38:59,204
- Where?
- At Maqsood's house.

1250
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:19,660
We have come together
for a truce...

1251
01:39:19,721 --> 01:39:22,099
not to quarrel like street dogs.

1252
01:39:23,992 --> 01:39:28,463
Sir, we respect you a
lot and that's why we are here.

1253
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:31,439
We honor your judgment.

1254
01:39:36,371 --> 01:39:40,513
I promise you we won't
wage this blazing war anymore.

1255
01:39:42,677 --> 01:39:45,988
But if anyone tries
to kindle a spark...

1256
01:39:46,147 --> 01:39:49,094
we will reduce them to ashes!

1257
01:39:50,752 --> 01:39:52,425
Dilawar...

1258
01:39:53,021 --> 01:39:55,763
do I have your word on this?

1259
01:39:56,157 --> 01:39:58,603
Sir, we are all Muslims here.

1260
01:39:59,094 --> 01:40:03,065
And a true Muslim always
sticks by his word.

1261
01:40:04,432 --> 01:40:05,775
All of you...

1262
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:09,647
Let's keep our hands
on the Holy Koran...

1263
01:40:10,538 --> 01:40:14,452
and make this truce solemn.

1264
01:40:17,578 --> 01:40:21,685
That historic truce was
more of an orchestrated act.

1265
01:40:22,117 --> 01:40:25,326
They took a solemn
oath on the Holy Koran.

1266
01:40:26,387 --> 01:40:29,766
They considered the Koran holy,
I didn't.

1267
01:40:30,725 --> 01:40:34,036
Alamzeb and Amirzada were traitors.

1268
01:40:35,563 --> 01:40:38,772
Zubair and Dilawar failed
to see their true colors.

1269
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:41,444
You knew them yet you
joined hands with them?

1270
01:40:44,272 --> 01:40:46,809
When two people have
a similar agenda...

1271
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:49,814
they can help themselves.

1272
01:40:50,178 --> 01:40:53,785
And you know very well,
how much I wanted to...

1273
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:58,085
get rid of the Haksar brothers.

1274
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:04,332
You've been swift
in making your mark.

1275
01:41:04,492 --> 01:41:09,066
If you aren't quick enough, you
are an easy target for your enemy.

1276
01:41:09,631 --> 01:41:10,701
Let's get to the point.

1277
01:41:10,765 --> 01:41:12,438
I want Zubair dead.

1278
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:13,843
Can you do it?

1279
01:41:14,135 --> 01:41:16,843
You're asking if I can
hit a nail with a hammer?

1280
01:41:18,706 --> 01:41:20,117
Manya, how could you say yes?

1281
01:41:20,141 --> 01:41:21,677
It's not an easy task.

1282
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:25,087
If it were easy,
he wouldn't come to me.

1283
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:28,354
Two gangs control Bombay city.

1284
01:41:28,482 --> 01:41:31,395
One gang has approached
us for help...

1285
01:41:31,786 --> 01:41:33,663
that makes them weaker than us.

1286
01:41:34,455 --> 01:41:36,662
And if we get rid
of the other gang...

1287
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:39,166
who is the undisputed
don of Bombay?

1288
01:41:39,694 --> 01:41:40,798
Manya Surve!

1289
01:41:40,861 --> 01:41:43,808
The Mastan gang controlled
Bombay for 40 years.

1290
01:41:44,199 --> 01:41:46,372
Finally one man decided
to take them on...

1291
01:41:46,501 --> 01:41:48,276
to destroy them.

1292
01:41:48,436 --> 01:41:51,144
To rule this city
with his fist. Zubair.

1293
01:41:51,272 --> 01:41:52,342
And we are to kill him?

1294
01:41:52,406 --> 01:41:55,615
People will talk about us
in the same way after a 100 years.

1295
01:41:55,843 --> 01:41:58,881
And no one will remember Zubair,
Dilawar or Mastan.

1296
01:41:59,847 --> 01:42:01,793
People will remember us.

1297
01:42:02,117 --> 01:42:04,290
Manya Surve and his gang!

1298
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:09,558
It's easy to become a criminal...

1299
01:42:10,391 --> 01:42:12,428
but this is a shot
at becoming a legend.

1300
01:42:13,761 --> 01:42:15,399
Who is with me?

1301
01:42:16,697 --> 01:42:19,644
Manya, you will either
kill or get us killed.

1302
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:21,338
If you get us killed,
we have no regrets.

1303
01:42:21,836 --> 01:42:26,148
But if you go for the kill,
it will be a fight to remember.

1304
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:02,744
Fill up the tank.

1305
01:43:03,511 --> 01:43:05,218
Sir, smoking is not--

1306
01:44:35,837 --> 01:44:37,316
Zubai r-..

1307
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:41,651
The jungle is the same,
but the lion has changed.

1308
01:44:56,557 --> 01:45:01,836
A jackal doesn't become
a lion by killing one.

1309
01:45:03,998 --> 01:45:08,640
All of you are jackals...

1310
01:45:08,903 --> 01:45:11,850
that's why you are
hunting in a pack.

1311
01:45:12,473 --> 01:45:15,511
Bloody jackals!

1312
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:28,957
Zubair Imtiaz Haksar, was
an emperor and is still an emperor.

1313
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:32,565
Well, this is Mariya Surve's
parting gift to an emperor.

1314
01:46:20,475 --> 01:46:21,954
Dilawar!

1315
01:46:22,510 --> 01:46:24,956
Take a look, Manya Surve
is standing in your lane.

1316
01:46:28,149 --> 01:46:30,095
Who the hell do you think you are?

1317
01:46:30,151 --> 01:46:31,755
- No, take it easy, Dilawar.
- Let me go.

1318
01:46:31,819 --> 01:46:33,662
It's suicidal to step out.

1319
01:46:33,821 --> 01:46:35,164
Remember I had said...

1320
01:46:35,423 --> 01:46:37,869
The day I attack,
I'll make sure I stab your chest.

1321
01:46:37,925 --> 01:46:40,735
That new kid on the block...
I'm going to bury him...

1322
01:46:40,795 --> 01:46:42,536
The new don of Bombay...

1323
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:43,731
Manya Surve.

1324
01:46:43,798 --> 01:46:46,438
We don't have back up or weapons.

1325
01:46:46,501 --> 01:46:47,673
Come on, let's go.

1326
01:46:47,735 --> 01:46:49,476
With Zubair dead
their gang is over.

1327
01:46:49,537 --> 01:46:50,914
Let me go.

1328
01:46:50,971 --> 01:46:54,180
We can kill Dilawar some other time."

1329
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:17,973
"The fire's raging.."

1330
01:47:21,836 --> 01:47:23,975
"There's smoke around.“

1331
01:47:27,741 --> 01:47:31,655
"The fire's raging,
there's smoke of love around."

1332
01:47:35,549 --> 01:47:39,122
"The fire's raging,
there's smoke of love around."

1333
01:47:39,453 --> 01:47:43,128
"Who stole my heart?“

1334
01:47:44,558 --> 01:47:48,096
"Here I am. Manya's here."

1335
01:47:48,462 --> 01:47:51,932
"Everyone's talking about me."

1336
01:47:52,133 --> 01:47:55,910
"Here I am. Manya's here."

1337
01:47:56,070 --> 01:47:59,779
"Everyone's talking about me."

1338
01:47:59,974 --> 01:48:03,581
"Here I am. Manya's here."

1339
01:48:03,878 --> 01:48:08,190
"Everyone's talking about me."

1340
01:48:33,107 --> 01:48:36,520
"He stares at me."

1341
01:48:36,910 --> 01:48:39,982
"Someone let him now."

1342
01:48:40,814 --> 01:48:44,057
"Hold him tight."

1343
01:48:44,652 --> 01:48:47,792
"He's mesmerized by my looks."

1344
01:48:48,589 --> 01:48:52,560
"You cannot endure the pain of love."

1345
01:48:56,530 --> 01:49:00,034
"I'll take any pain you give me."

1346
01:49:00,101 --> 01:49:03,947
"I'll willingly accept any anguish."

1347
01:49:04,005 --> 01:49:09,079
"I can do anything you wish."

1348
01:49:11,945 --> 01:49:15,654
"I can do anything you wish."

1349
01:49:15,716 --> 01:49:21,029
"Anything's possible for you."

1350
01:49:22,023 --> 01:49:25,732
"You're special,
you make my heart beat."

1351
01:49:25,893 --> 01:49:29,841
"I'm floored on you."

1352
01:49:31,032 --> 01:49:34,844
"Here he is. Manya's here."

1353
01:49:34,902 --> 01:49:38,782
"You're different, you're unique."

1354
01:49:38,839 --> 01:49:42,286
"Here I am. Manya's here."

1355
01:49:42,710 --> 01:49:46,624
"Everyone's talking about me."

1356
01:49:46,647 --> 01:49:50,094
"Here he is. Manya's here."

1357
01:49:50,284 --> 01:49:54,164
"You're different, you're unique."

1358
01:49:54,221 --> 01:49:58,067
"Here I am. Manya's here."

1359
01:49:58,125 --> 01:50:02,596
"Everyone's talking about me."

1360
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:13,843
Let's go.

1361
01:50:14,041 --> 01:50:15,315
Is everyone ready?

1362
01:50:15,376 --> 01:50:16,616
Of course, we are.

1363
01:50:16,677 --> 01:50:19,351
Don't spare anyone
from Manya's gang.

1364
01:50:19,613 --> 01:50:21,786
He was barking like
a dog in my lane.

1365
01:50:21,849 --> 01:50:23,886
Set Agar Bazaar on fire,
if necessary.

1366
01:50:24,151 --> 01:50:25,630
QKZY-

1367
01:50:25,653 --> 01:50:27,064
Where is Zubair?

1368
01:50:27,854 --> 01:50:30,027
I asked, where is Zubair?

1369
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:32,395
He went to see Chitra.

1370
01:50:35,830 --> 01:50:37,901
He's never stayed
this long with her.

1371
01:50:38,699 --> 01:50:39,871
Something is wrong.

1372
01:50:42,336 --> 01:50:44,282
Bhai, there's a call from J.J.
Hospital.

1373
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:14,069
Zubai r-

1374
01:52:24,905 --> 01:52:26,748
Sir, we're taking
the body for post-mortem.

1375
01:52:26,774 --> 01:52:27,946
No!

1376
01:52:30,144 --> 01:52:32,454
No one will touch him.

1377
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:36,324
They have cut him ruthlessly.

1378
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:40,955
Now it's my turn to cut.

1379
01:52:42,489 --> 01:52:45,026
As long as Zubair was alive,
he kept Dilawar in check.

1380
01:52:45,893 --> 01:52:48,203
Now he will turn the
underworld upside down.

1381
01:52:49,363 --> 01:52:53,436
Where Zubair's tale ends,
Dilawar's begins.

1382
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,377
The death is in their family...

1383
01:52:56,169 --> 01:52:58,308
but the whole city
will mourn tomorrow.

1384
01:53:03,410 --> 01:53:06,323
Vidya, open the door.

1385
01:53:07,448 --> 01:53:09,291
Manohar, go away!

1386
01:53:09,516 --> 01:53:10,824
Vidya, open the door.

1387
01:53:10,851 --> 01:53:12,125
I won't open the door.

1388
01:53:12,186 --> 01:53:13,995
If you don't I'll break it down.

1389
01:53:16,957 --> 01:53:18,402
Vidya... open the door.

1390
01:53:20,561 --> 01:53:21,869
Don't create a scene!

1391
01:53:21,929 --> 01:53:23,237
Go away.

1392
01:53:32,506 --> 01:53:33,917
M anohar.-.

1393
01:53:38,845 --> 01:53:39,846
Why are you here?

1394
01:53:39,913 --> 01:53:42,450
Didn't you say... 'One word
and women would do as you say}?

1395
01:53:42,816 --> 01:53:43,988
Then why are you here?

1396
01:53:45,052 --> 01:53:47,191
I don't want such women.

1397
01:53:47,421 --> 01:53:49,059
I want you.

1398
01:53:58,131 --> 01:53:59,337
Why me?

1399
01:54:03,337 --> 01:54:07,251
Because the Manohar that died,
loved you.

1400
01:54:08,108 --> 01:54:12,079
And until Manya dies,
he will only love you.

1401
01:55:17,611 --> 01:55:20,285
Allah! You're our benefactor.

1402
01:55:20,347 --> 01:55:22,224
Forgive their sins.

1403
01:55:22,282 --> 01:55:24,990
Accept our prayers.

1404
01:55:59,153 --> 01:56:00,063
Salaam!

1405
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:04,159
We are very sorry for your loss.

1406
01:56:05,425 --> 01:56:07,701
Is this why you wanted a truce?

1407
01:56:09,563 --> 01:56:11,543
No, Dilawar.

1408
01:56:12,165 --> 01:56:14,338
All of us want peace.

1409
01:56:15,035 --> 01:56:19,142
Your brother's killer
won't be spared.

1410
01:56:21,275 --> 01:56:23,084
I lost my brother.

1411
01:56:23,577 --> 01:56:25,215
And I will avenge his death.

1412
01:56:26,547 --> 01:56:29,551
I don't care what the population
of this country is...

1413
01:56:29,984 --> 01:56:31,759
but I will turn it into a cemetery.

1414
01:56:32,486 --> 01:56:33,726
Khuda-hafiz.

1415
01:57:05,118 --> 01:57:07,189
Did he tell you where Manya is?

1416
01:57:08,255 --> 01:57:09,393
No.

1417
01:57:36,583 --> 01:57:38,824
I want Munir.

1418
01:57:54,601 --> 01:57:56,080
- Let's go.
- Munir...

1419
01:57:56,536 --> 01:57:58,072
You go ahead,
I'm not feeling too well.

1420
01:57:58,104 --> 01:58:00,243
I guess it's last night's dinner.
I'll see you later.

1421
01:58:00,307 --> 01:58:02,753
Idiot, you should have
some control over what you eat.

1422
01:58:03,110 --> 01:58:05,852
That was good biryani
that you've wasted. Hurry up.

1423
01:58:06,113 --> 01:58:07,683
- Salaam, Munir.
- Walekum-a-salaam.

1424
01:58:46,253 --> 01:58:48,733
You are definitely
going to meet God today.

1425
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:54,566
Tell me where Manya is
and you'll get a worthy death.

1426
01:58:54,761 --> 01:58:56,798
I won't tell you.

1427
01:58:58,231 --> 01:59:02,543
I'm grateful for a death
that will extend my friend's life.

1428
01:59:02,702 --> 01:59:07,776
It's unfortunate that
you're dying to save a Hindu.

1429
01:59:10,210 --> 01:59:13,487
A true Muslim will kill...

1430
01:59:14,681 --> 01:59:17,184
and also give up his
own life for a dear friend.

1431
01:59:18,685 --> 01:59:21,256
Friendship doesn't
subscribe to religion.

1432
01:59:24,691 --> 01:59:26,796
Neither does enmity.

1433
01:59:28,896 --> 01:59:30,239
QKZY-

1434
01:59:31,197 --> 01:59:33,575
As soon as you step out
of God's house on earth...

1435
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:36,246
be prepared to meet Him in heaven.

1436
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:16,883
Munir is in trouble.

1437
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:42,277
Stop!

1438
02:01:25,846 --> 02:01:27,052
What happened?

1439
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:31,722
Shut up.

1440
02:01:35,322 --> 02:01:37,598
Come Veera. Quickly!

1441
02:02:30,377 --> 02:02:32,084
Munir!

1442
02:02:32,913 --> 02:02:34,586
Get up!

1443
02:02:42,389 --> 02:02:43,834
Get up.

1444
02:02:46,426 --> 02:02:47,905
Get up.

1445
02:02:51,898 --> 02:02:53,969
Munir.

1446
02:03:01,608 --> 02:03:04,054
Munir get up.

1447
02:03:07,714 --> 02:03:08,988
Come.

1448
02:03:24,397 --> 02:03:25,876
Where are you going?

1449
02:03:26,833 --> 02:03:29,074
To take care of
unfinished business.

1450
02:03:30,003 --> 02:03:32,040
I'm sending Dilawar to his brother.

1451
02:03:32,438 --> 02:03:36,511
If you want to commit suicide,
hang yourself from a ceiling fan.

1452
02:03:36,943 --> 02:03:38,980
Why are you presenting
yourself to Dilawar?

1453
02:03:43,016 --> 02:03:44,495
Don't you trust me anymore?

1454
02:03:44,551 --> 02:03:46,087
It's not about trust...

1455
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:47,958
it's about time.

1456
02:03:48,021 --> 02:03:50,001
Time is a fleeting companion.

1457
02:03:50,423 --> 02:03:52,835
Yesterday it was on our side,
today it's with him.

1458
02:03:52,893 --> 02:03:54,099
What do you suggest?

1459
02:03:54,161 --> 02:03:56,505
That I should hide like a mouse?

1460
02:03:56,563 --> 02:03:57,769
Yes.

1461
02:03:57,831 --> 02:04:00,641
We give him a chance to
make the same mistake we did.

1462
02:04:00,834 --> 02:04:02,871
Let him think we are weak.

1463
02:04:03,736 --> 02:04:05,909
And when time moves
over to our side...

1464
02:04:06,139 --> 02:04:08,119
you make your move on Dilawar.

1465
02:04:08,975 --> 02:04:12,184
Fine, I'll do as you say.

1466
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:16,160
But I won't stay
cooped up for long.

1467
02:04:18,584 --> 02:04:21,622
It's easy to kill
a snake in an open space.

1468
02:04:21,788 --> 02:04:25,736
Once it is in the burrow, it's
impossible to escape its venom.

1469
02:04:38,805 --> 02:04:40,648
I track the movements of cops.

1470
02:04:40,707 --> 02:04:43,085
I figured that when I saw you.

1471
02:04:43,776 --> 02:04:45,483
What do you want?

1472
02:04:45,612 --> 02:04:46,852
Manya Surve.

1473
02:04:47,647 --> 02:04:48,955
Dead!

1474
02:04:50,717 --> 02:04:54,494
Bombay is a haystack and
Manya is the proverbial needle.

1475
02:04:55,689 --> 02:04:57,669
My gang is unable to find him.

1476
02:04:58,525 --> 02:05:01,904
If anyone can find him, it's you.

1477
02:05:03,096 --> 02:05:05,076
You can name your price...

1478
02:05:05,998 --> 02:05:07,534
for getting rid of Manya.

1479
02:05:08,502 --> 02:05:11,005
Shoot him with all
the bullets that you have.

1480
02:05:11,237 --> 02:05:14,741
I didn't choose this
uniform to fulfill your wish.

1481
02:05:15,241 --> 02:05:17,619
I'll ignore this encounter.

1482
02:05:18,878 --> 02:05:20,255
Encounter...

1483
02:05:20,513 --> 02:05:21,753
that's a nice word for...

1484
02:05:23,182 --> 02:05:24,661
'a meeting'.

1485
02:05:26,052 --> 02:05:28,157
So go ahead and help
Manya encounter death.

1486
02:05:29,656 --> 02:05:31,192
I'll make sure you
get both money and medals.

1487
02:05:31,525 --> 02:05:32,936
Didn't you hear what I said?

1488
02:05:33,159 --> 02:05:35,298
Kill him wherever you see him.

1489
02:05:35,595 --> 02:05:39,065
Label it a shootout or an encounter,
but make sure the case is closed.

1490
02:05:39,298 --> 02:05:43,212
I guarantee there won't
be any inquiry into his killing.

1491
02:05:44,070 --> 02:05:45,242
Listen carefully...

1492
02:05:45,304 --> 02:05:48,251
I can afford two meals a
day and I pray five times a day.

1493
02:05:49,208 --> 02:05:50,915
That's all I need.

1494
02:05:51,878 --> 02:05:54,017
You can never put a price on me.

1495
02:05:54,948 --> 02:05:57,792
You may not have a price,
but I'm sure your seniors do.

1496
02:05:58,752 --> 02:06:00,993
You will have to carry
out your senior's order.

1497
02:06:02,021 --> 02:06:03,864
And you will get one.

1498
02:06:13,099 --> 02:06:14,305
Afaaque...

1499
02:06:15,735 --> 02:06:18,614
what was so important that
couldn't wait until morning?

1500
02:06:18,805 --> 02:06:22,275
Today I realized why the color
of the police uniform is khaki.

1501
02:06:22,642 --> 02:06:25,179
People can crap all over
us yet it won't be seen.

1502
02:06:26,846 --> 02:06:27,916
What happened?

1503
02:06:28,281 --> 02:06:30,261
Dilawar wanted to crap all over...

1504
02:06:31,217 --> 02:06:32,958
he wants Manya Surve dead.

1505
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:37,729
And he wanted a cop
to do the dirty deed.

1506
02:06:38,257 --> 02:06:39,736
He said,
kill Manya in an 'encounter'.

1507
02:06:39,793 --> 02:06:41,636
First he tried to bribe and then..

1508
02:06:41,694 --> 02:06:42,934
...he threatened with
an order from the top.

1509
02:06:43,730 --> 02:06:45,232
I wanted to shoot
him dead right there.

1510
02:06:45,598 --> 02:06:47,043
But I was helpless.

1511
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:49,041
We have to seek
permission from you..

1512
02:06:49,102 --> 02:06:50,672
...even if we have
to go to the bathroom.

1513
02:06:50,937 --> 02:06:52,245
Even if we know
who the criminal is...

1514
02:06:52,305 --> 02:06:55,775
we have to get the evidence
and witness before filing an FIR.

1515
02:06:55,842 --> 02:06:57,116
And then we get the warrant.

1516
02:06:57,210 --> 02:07:00,054
Until then the witness
is either bought or killed.

1517
02:07:00,113 --> 02:07:01,820
And the criminal walks away free.

1518
02:07:01,881 --> 02:07:04,327
The prostitutes are better than us.

1519
02:07:04,384 --> 02:07:07,888
At least their clients
get some pleasure for the money.

1520
02:07:08,054 --> 02:07:10,728
First we take an oath,
then we take our salary...

1521
02:07:10,790 --> 02:07:13,361
and then we watch the
drama in the police station...

1522
02:07:14,394 --> 02:07:18,342
while the criminal
takes us for a ride.

1523
02:07:20,333 --> 02:07:21,971
Have you said what you wanted to?

1524
02:07:22,969 --> 02:07:24,209
May I say something now?

1525
02:07:26,739 --> 02:07:28,116
Get rid of Manya Surve.

1526
02:07:30,143 --> 02:07:31,315
Kill him.

1527
02:07:33,379 --> 02:07:34,915
Not for Dilawar...

1528
02:07:36,182 --> 02:07:38,253
and not because we
have an order from the top.

1529
02:07:40,186 --> 02:07:43,793
But for the sake of our uniform.

1530
02:07:45,959 --> 02:07:48,872
Dilawar said, 'I may not
have a price, but my seniors do'.

1531
02:07:50,096 --> 02:07:51,268
How much did he pay, sir?

1532
02:08:03,276 --> 02:08:08,316
You think you're
the only honest cop?

1533
02:08:09,682 --> 02:08:13,755
You know why the color
of this uniform is khakhi?

1534
02:08:14,754 --> 02:08:17,325
It's the color of mud.

1535
02:08:18,024 --> 02:08:22,734
And every cop is ready to become
one with it or bury a criminal in it.

1536
02:08:23,163 --> 02:08:24,301
Why Manya, sir?

1537
02:08:25,031 --> 02:08:25,941
Why not Dilawar?

1538
02:08:25,998 --> 02:08:28,808
I don't care who dies.

1539
02:08:29,068 --> 02:08:31,708
Manya is a criminal
and the world knows that.

1540
02:08:31,805 --> 02:08:35,753
While Dilawar is pretending
to be a righteous citizen.

1541
02:08:35,942 --> 02:08:38,718
If you kill Dilawar,
there could be an inquiry.

1542
02:08:38,878 --> 02:08:42,883
But if you kill Manya, it will be a
slap in the face of other criminals.

1543
02:08:43,249 --> 02:08:45,456
The decision is yours.

1544
02:08:46,819 --> 02:08:48,093
You have to choose one.

1545
02:08:49,755 --> 02:08:50,961
Manya, sir.

1546
02:08:51,825 --> 02:08:53,099
I choose Manya.

1547
02:08:55,361 --> 02:08:56,806
Welcome officers.

1548
02:08:56,997 --> 02:08:59,944
Until today no country
has given their police force...

1549
02:09:00,767 --> 02:09:03,839
the opportunity that
we are about to receive.

1550
02:09:05,171 --> 02:09:09,051
The liberty to shoot any criminal.

1551
02:09:10,210 --> 02:09:13,384
But until Manya Surve is alive...

1552
02:09:13,446 --> 02:09:15,426
we will neither sleep not rest.

1553
02:09:19,052 --> 02:09:21,760
Some people study history,
while others teach history.

1554
02:09:21,854 --> 02:09:24,425
We are going to create history.

1555
02:09:24,790 --> 02:09:26,201
We will form three groups.

1556
02:09:26,259 --> 02:09:27,932
Ambat will lead the first group...

1557
02:09:30,096 --> 02:09:33,043
I will lead the second
and Bhende the third.

1558
02:09:36,536 --> 02:09:41,383
The dossier contains photographs
of Manya and his gang members.

1559
02:09:42,475 --> 02:09:46,855
The photographs are old,
but you will get a fair idea.

1560
02:09:51,951 --> 02:09:53,931
Sir, he is in room number 10.

1561
02:09:57,557 --> 02:09:59,036
Stop.

1562
02:10:06,198 --> 02:10:08,303
- Move it.
- Where do I go?

1563
02:10:12,105 --> 02:10:14,142
I pity you, Jamal.

1564
02:10:15,207 --> 02:10:17,915
Helping Dilawar to capture
Munir was a big mistake.

1565
02:10:18,144 --> 02:10:21,216
Dilawar doesn't need you
anymore and Manya won't spare you.

1566
02:10:21,414 --> 02:10:23,587
He won't let you live
and I won't let you die.

1567
02:10:23,883 --> 02:10:25,590
Save me, sir.
I don't want to die now.

1568
02:10:25,851 --> 02:10:28,923
Every time you try to hide...

1569
02:10:30,556 --> 02:10:32,160
I will find you.

1570
02:10:32,358 --> 02:10:35,896
And I will set you free
so that Manya can kill you.

1571
02:10:36,128 --> 02:10:37,232
Save me, sir.

1572
02:10:37,297 --> 02:10:41,905
But I have a deal that will help
you stay alive and keep you safe.

1573
02:10:43,369 --> 02:10:44,848
In prison.

1574
02:10:46,005 --> 02:10:48,144
Tell me how to get to Manya.

1575
02:10:49,475 --> 02:10:53,514
You will get police protection
and the police will get Manya.

1576
02:10:55,548 --> 02:10:57,152
What say?

1577
02:10:58,117 --> 02:10:59,425
Vidya, sir...

1578
02:11:00,420 --> 02:11:01,558
Vi dya?

1579
02:11:02,422 --> 02:11:04,925
Vidya will lead you to Manya.

1580
02:11:12,265 --> 02:11:13,869
Where is Manya?

1581
02:11:15,335 --> 02:11:17,406
When did you last see him?

1582
02:11:17,904 --> 02:11:19,611
Look at these pictures.

1583
02:11:19,973 --> 02:11:24,547
They were Manya's companions
and look what Dilawar did to them.

1584
02:11:27,913 --> 02:11:30,291
Manya killed Dilawafs brother...

1585
02:11:31,918 --> 02:11:33,522
imagine what he will do to Manya.

1586
02:11:33,886 --> 02:11:35,297
He will give Manya
such a brutal death that...

1587
02:11:35,355 --> 02:11:39,963
it will be difficult to identify
his body or even cremate him.

1588
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:42,903
Think about this...

1589
02:11:43,963 --> 02:11:47,604
gangsters like Haji Maqsood and
Wasim Lala have given up crime...

1590
02:11:47,667 --> 02:11:50,546
and are leading a normal life.

1591
02:11:51,571 --> 02:11:52,914
It's because of us.

1592
02:11:52,939 --> 02:11:57,046
Manya can also have this,
if he helps us.

1593
02:11:57,543 --> 02:12:00,217
Why do you want to help Manohar?

1594
02:12:00,480 --> 02:12:02,653
He considers the cops his enemy.

1595
02:12:03,049 --> 02:12:04,528
He hates cops.

1596
02:12:04,684 --> 02:12:06,357
That's his opinion.

1597
02:12:06,519 --> 02:12:08,294
What will we get by killing Manya?

1598
02:12:08,454 --> 02:12:10,957
We may not be able to stop
people from becoming criminals...

1599
02:12:11,190 --> 02:12:16,572
but we can offer criminals like Manya
a chance to lead a normal life.

1600
02:12:17,263 --> 02:12:21,336
Can you guarantee that there
is no danger to Manohar's life?

1601
02:12:21,501 --> 02:12:22,605
No, I can't.

1602
02:12:22,668 --> 02:12:24,306
But if you don't help us...

1603
02:12:25,304 --> 02:12:29,514
I can guarantee that
Manya will be killed.

1604
02:12:39,285 --> 02:12:40,229
Pawar...

1605
02:12:40,286 --> 02:12:41,287
Yes sir.

1606
02:12:41,687 --> 02:12:43,598
Two cups tea, please.

1607
02:12:48,327 --> 02:12:50,000
- Hello...
- Hello...

1608
02:12:51,096 --> 02:12:52,336
M anohar?

1609
02:12:53,699 --> 02:12:55,235
Are you alright?

1610
02:12:55,301 --> 02:12:56,302
Yes.

1611
02:12:56,969 --> 02:13:00,644
I want to go out of town for
a few days, will you come along?

1612
02:13:01,274 --> 02:13:02,617
Where to?

1613
02:13:04,043 --> 02:13:05,283
I don't know.

1614
02:13:05,711 --> 02:13:08,555
If you are with me,
we'll figure something.

1615
02:13:09,682 --> 02:13:10,683
When?

1616
02:13:10,749 --> 02:13:12,092
Tomorrow...

1617
02:13:12,285 --> 02:13:13,628
12 o'clock...

1618
02:13:14,454 --> 02:13:15,762
Wadala College.

1619
02:13:17,223 --> 02:13:18,531
Sure.

1620
02:13:40,379 --> 02:13:41,619
Hello...

1621
02:13:42,114 --> 02:13:43,422
Inspector Baagraan?

1622
02:13:46,619 --> 02:13:47,791
Got him.

1623
02:13:48,654 --> 02:13:50,099
Officers!

1624
02:13:50,656 --> 02:13:53,159
This is the layout of
Ambedkar College at Wadala.

1625
02:13:53,393 --> 02:13:55,532
Manya Surve will be there
at 12 o'clock tomorrow...

1626
02:13:55,728 --> 02:13:58,334
and we will teach him
a lesson he'll never forget.

1627
02:13:58,464 --> 02:14:03,436
Just like a fox sniffs out
a rabbit before attacking it...

1628
02:14:03,669 --> 02:14:07,776
Manya Surve will sniff
out cops before being attacked.

1629
02:14:08,174 --> 02:14:12,680
He will have a gun but
he won't know whom to fire at.

1630
02:14:12,745 --> 02:14:15,453
We will go there undercover...

1631
02:14:15,515 --> 02:14:17,153
As college students.

1632
02:14:17,216 --> 02:14:19,560
Jeans, t-shirt, sneakers...

1633
02:14:19,719 --> 02:14:21,699
your makeover should
be so perfect that...

1634
02:14:21,754 --> 02:14:24,325
even your own mother shouldn't
be able to recognize.

1635
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:25,596
Let's go. - Yes, sir.

1636
02:14:28,694 --> 02:14:32,767
All of you will carry
books with concealed guns.

1637
02:14:36,635 --> 02:14:38,308
Ambat and I will
cover the college...

1638
02:14:38,437 --> 02:14:40,713
whereas the rest will be with
Bhende manning the road blocks.

1639
02:14:40,839 --> 02:14:42,443
If Manya decides
to escape by road...

1640
02:14:42,508 --> 02:14:44,454
he has three options.

1641
02:14:44,577 --> 02:14:47,285
Dahisar, Thana or Vashi.

1642
02:14:47,513 --> 02:14:48,583
I will be at Vashi...

1643
02:14:48,647 --> 02:14:50,285
- Shetty will be at Dahisar
- Yes sir.

1644
02:14:50,349 --> 02:14:52,158
- And Jamdade will be at Thana.
- Yes sir.

1645
02:14:55,821 --> 02:14:57,425
Stop.

1646
02:14:58,157 --> 02:14:59,534
I am sorry, sir.

1647
02:14:59,592 --> 02:15:00,832
I can't shave off my moustache.

1648
02:15:01,093 --> 02:15:03,437
In my community, I can shave
it off only after my father dies.

1649
02:15:04,430 --> 02:15:07,309
If you father were to hear you,
he'd die of shame.

1650
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:09,705
A cops father feels proud
of his son when he is ready to...

1651
02:15:09,769 --> 02:15:12,750
not just shave off his moustache
but lay down his life for duty.

1652
02:15:13,239 --> 02:15:14,684
Come on...

1653
02:15:19,645 --> 02:15:20,851
Shave!

1654
02:15:27,720 --> 02:15:29,859
- No, I can't do it.
- Sit.

1655
02:15:30,823 --> 02:15:32,200
You have to do it, Ambolkar.

1656
02:15:32,358 --> 02:15:33,336
But why me?

1657
02:15:33,392 --> 02:15:37,431
You are the only cop who
has seen Manya Surve from up close.

1658
02:15:37,863 --> 02:15:40,366
You will be standing outside
the college dressed as a postman.

1659
02:15:40,566 --> 02:15:43,877
When you see him you will shift the
bag from your left shoulder to...

1660
02:15:44,169 --> 02:15:46,547
your right as a signal.

1661
02:15:46,672 --> 02:15:48,413
I won't wear a postman's uniform.

1662
02:15:48,474 --> 02:15:50,215
You have to.

1663
02:15:50,776 --> 02:15:54,189
When you can wear a veil, what's wrong
in wearing a postman's uniform?

1664
02:15:54,346 --> 02:15:55,882
What if he recognizes me?

1665
02:15:56,148 --> 02:15:58,185
That's why it is
important for you...

1666
02:15:58,217 --> 02:16:01,289
to recognize him before
he recognizes you.

1667
02:18:56,061 --> 02:18:57,631
M anohar.-.

1668
02:19:08,707 --> 02:19:10,050
Come on! Let's go.

1669
02:20:13,038 --> 02:20:15,541
Am bat... corner him.

1670
02:21:18,637 --> 02:21:19,877
Stop firing!

1671
02:21:23,241 --> 02:21:25,016
Stop!

1672
02:21:34,553 --> 02:21:35,793
M anya...

1673
02:21:39,725 --> 02:21:40,999
Surrender...

1674
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:49,872
Surrender!

1675
02:23:58,864 --> 02:24:00,138
Am bat...

1676
02:24:01,199 --> 02:24:04,908
put the body in the vehicle
and drive to Sion Hospital.

1677
02:25:10,969 --> 02:25:12,243
- Rane...
- Yes sir.

1678
02:25:12,304 --> 02:25:13,715
File a report.

1679
02:25:14,172 --> 02:25:15,947
Manya Surve, dead on arrival.

1680
02:25:16,174 --> 02:25:17,414
Killed in encounter.

1681
02:25:17,876 --> 02:25:19,981
- Take the body to the morgue.
- Yes sir.
