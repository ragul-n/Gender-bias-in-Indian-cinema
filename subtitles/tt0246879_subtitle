1
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,484
Should we open the gates?
- She's an old flame. Let her in.

2
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,695
Raka sahib.

3
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,698
Jwala is here.

4
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,898
Why have you come?
- For my brother's sake.

5
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:21,573
Take the charges back,

6
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,742
and let him out ofjail.

7
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:32,090
That moron tried to kill me.

8
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,757
l could've fed him to the dogs...

9
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:40,765
if l wanted. But l don't want
to take the law in my hands.

10
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:46,268
That's because l'm a gentleman.
And l am peace-loving.

11
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,269
Only l know how much of
a peace-loving gentleman you are.

12
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:57,105
When you seduced me,
you were just a pauper.

13
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:01,943
Then you grabbed all l had...
my inheritance, my diamonds.

14
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:08,123
That's how you rose to become
''Raka, the richest man''

15
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,292
''On every morsel is writ the name
of the one who will eat it'' (adage).

16
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,629
So also with silver.
On every piece is writ a name.

17
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,633
lt's all a matter of luck
and a man's hard work.

18
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:23,805
Time was when you were everything!
And l was a nobody.

19
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:28,636
Today, l am everything!
And you are a nobody.

20
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,645
Maybe your brother couldn't
come to terms with my successes.

21
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,154
My brother came to teach you a lesson
for the scum that you are.

22
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:42,326
He wanted to avenge me. My ruination.
- The outcome of which he now suffers.

23
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:46,164
l robbed you and l got away with it.

24
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,993
lf you have the courage, then come
snatch it all back from me

25
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,663
Consider ourselves in a state of war.
ln war, a Rajput...

26
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:59,006
would never beg. Unlike you.
- Don't exceed your limits!

27
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,674
Speak softly! You are in my house

28
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:09,347
Like my patience, the glass panes in
my house are thin and very sensitive.

29
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:14,191
Your pride and your glass panes
l will crush under my feet some day.

30
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,029
Else l am no Jwala.

31
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:34,044
Vikram, Raka has refused
to withdraw the charges.

32
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,711
Never mind. Try as much as he might,
the sentence won't exceed a year.

33
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,720
After that, it's between us!

34
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,226
Time over.

35
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,892
l'll come back tomorrow.
With the lawyer.

36
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:05,235
Jwala came here to threaten me.
Never mind what it costs.

37
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,580
Just make sure her brother
serves the longest possible time.

38
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:17,745
You're soiling my car.
- No sir. l'm cleaning it sir.

39
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,917
l'm hungry. Will you please
give me some money? Allah bless you.

40
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,922
Get lost.
- God bless you.

41
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,036
Hey! What have you done?

42
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:41,110
l didn't do that, sir.
The scratch was there before.

43
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,512
Rascal! You're lying.

44
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:48,777
l may be poor. But l'm no liar.
- Don't you dare talk back.

45
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:58,263
You'll never forget who l am
- God, you couldn't be!

46
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,791
Human, you don't seem to be.
And l'm not scared of the devil.

47
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:08,296
And what have you to say of yourself?
- Praise the good Lord who made us all.

48
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:13,141
Tell me, a small scratch means more
to you than a man? Because he's poor?

49
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,647
He isn't a man. The likes of him
are vermin for society

50
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,417
Dogs like them should be
run over and killed

51
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:25,154
So proud of your car?
- Hey mister, this is a mercedes.

52
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,549
Have you ever driven
something like this?

53
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:31,493
Not yet. But l'll give it a try.
How about a 50-cent bet?

54
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:36,827
What are you doing?

55
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,024
You'll get me killed!

56
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,876
You've destroyed my car!

57
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:32,724
Stop!

58
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,412
Let me go!
- Boss, one more chance please.

59
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,093
No, l don't think
l can handle this car

60
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,598
You win.

61
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:18,930
Here's one buck.
Fifty for the bet.

62
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,107
The rest for repairs.

63
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:49,530
Fantastic Sheila! You're voice
is as lovely as you are.

64
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,671
Thank you.

65
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,220
What do you think of me?

66
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,217
lf you ever speak to Sheila
like that again...

67
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,486
l'll shove these whiskers
down your throat.

68
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,969
You mustn't get so worked up, Rajesh.
These are my fans.

69
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,406
And some of them aren't sophisticated.
- To hell with your fans.

70
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,735
Next time, l'll hang one of them.

71
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,252
Have you cooled down?

72
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,432
Rajesh, how long has it been
since we met?

73
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,608
About an hour and a half.
- l'm not talking about today.

74
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,944
When did we meet first?
- Long, long ago...

75
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,109
when the sun nor moon nor stars,
nor the skies, nor earth was.

76
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,952
No digression. lt's been
a year and a half

77
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,455
And you haven't yet told me
what you do.

78
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,296
l enjoy myself.
- Apparently!

79
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:22,966
What do you happen to do
for a living?

80
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:30,972
l steal.
- Stop joking, Rajesh.

81
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:36,804
lt's true. But you won't believe me.
- Did you just go crazy?

82
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,651
No point talking to you.

83
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,823
What are you searching?
- l think l dropped my keys.

84
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,826
So help me God!

85
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:20,518
l'm becoming apprehensive.
You aren't really a thief, are you?

86
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,851
Do l look like a thief?
You are the thief

87
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:28,525
You've seduced me. And you've
robbed me of all l had.

88
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:35,366
Sheila, no more singing
in the nightclub.

89
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,471
Now let me have it.

90
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,310
You...?

91
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,973
l taught you how to steal.
Where did you learn how to fight?

92
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,977
What are you doing here?
- Stealing. Not praying, surely...?

93
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,149
Been working on it for two hours.
Bloody thing wouldn't give in.

94
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:35,152
Then l saw a shadow. And l thought it
must be Rajesh. Who else would dare...?

95
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,662
Now give it to me.
- What?

96
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,161
Half of it is mine.
- No guests, please.

97
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,163
Hey, l'm your guru! You're expected
to give a handsel to your guru.

98
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:49,169
One pays obeisances to his guru.
One doesn't pay a guru in cash

99
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:53,508
Come on, for old times' sake.
- No friends between thieves.

100
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:57,504
Will you bite the hand that fed you?
- Get lost.

101
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,685
Come on, give me a share.
l'm going away to London.

102
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:06,183
Who knows if we'll ever meet again?
- Joe, you're going to London?

103
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,693
Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me earlier?

104
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,696
l wanted to test you.

105
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,537
May l...?
Really?

106
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:23,873
Long live, my friend!
That's why l say, friendliness is...

107
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,545
Next to godliness?
- Well said!

108
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,736
What a dish!

109
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,249
My car crashed into yours. My mistake.
- Never mind

110
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,985
You're so handsome!
You're so beautiful!

111
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:16,249
Look, you drove my quarry away

112
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,093
You're no less than Cleopatra.

113
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,358
Excuse me, l'm in a hurry.

114
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,090
l'm in no hurry. l'm not leaving you!

115
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:24,259
Please Mother! For God's sake!
- You called me mother?

116
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,450
What happened?

117
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,619
Nothing... it's nothing,
lnspector sahib.

118
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,618
My car crashed into someone's car.

119
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:49,123
Your license and registration.

120
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,632
ln the car. l'll get it.

121
00:23:55,167 --> 00:24:00,469
Your license too.
- Why do you want my license?

122
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,534
Afterwards we got to know about
a robbery in the neighborhood.

123
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:32,662
Forced open a safe.
Cash and jewelry stolen.

124
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,339
This man's background
is quite interesting.

125
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:41,009
Used to be a motorbike daredevil.
He gave it up after an accident.

126
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,341
For a while, he disappeared.
When he surfaced again...

127
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:48,675
he was a changed man. He has
an apartment. And he has a car.

128
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:54,189
But no reported occupation.
- Of late, there has been a spurt...

129
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:59,355
in robberies. Even the toughest of
safes are cracked open. Like magic.

130
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:05,169
The car he was traveling in
was stolen. That's why he ran

131
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:50,137
l didn't fall down.
l was surveying the height.

132
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,977
lt isn't too high.

133
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,650
There's more behind me.

134
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,991
Thanks.

135
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:22,333
Fatso, sign up with the Army if you
like shooting. Why are you after me?

136
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,836
The name is Khan. Amjad Khan

137
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:32,509
And a Khan doesn't let go
once he has latched on

138
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,015
Sticky customer

139
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:41,522
Are you forcing yourself upon me?
- Yes.

140
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,033
You know him?

141
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,871
Handsome fellow, isn't he?

142
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,374
Couldn't be a relative, could he be?
- No.

143
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:01,371
What does he do?
- Robs.

144
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:06,544
Goodness! Robs?
Boys these days...

145
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:12,883
Friend, this gun has 3 bullets.
How many would you like to bite?

146
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:16,894
l'm not hungry.
Please help yourself.

147
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,563
You'll find it very appetizing.
The bag.

148
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:29,566
Okay. But believe me, the clothes
in it aren't your size.

149
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,642
They won't fit.
Anyway, if you insist.

150
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:43,747
What was that? A hammer?
You could've broken my jaw.

151
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:52,422
Enough ofjokes. Get it?

152
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:39,473
Fatso, look the police are coming
You'll get caught...

153
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,977
and you'll get me caught too.
You want the stuff, right?

154
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,638
Let's share it. Fifty fifty.
Let go... come on, let go.

155
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,410
l will.
- l can't breathe. Let go.

156
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,987
l will, l will.

157
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:09,166
Rajesh Kumar alias Kailash Nath
is hereby convicted for robbery.

158
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,842
Under section 392 of
the lndian Penal Code...

159
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,911
the convict is sentenced
to rigorous imprisonment...

160
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,013
for three and a half years

161
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:40,026
Shocked? Are you?!
- l told you l'm a thief.

162
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,199
But if you still love a thief,
wait for me.

163
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:53,377
Sheila, promise me that you'll
never come to the jail to see me.

164
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,054
l won't be able to bear it.

165
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,258
l need a van.
A big one.

166
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:46,103
For three days.
You'll get a lot of money.

167
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,267
Who sent you?
- God.

168
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,447
Listen...

169
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:04,452
Why are you so angry? Did you look at
yourself in the mirror this morning?

170
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,125
lf you don't get lost, l'll send you
to the hospital in this ambulance

171
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,788
Bad joke.

172
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:22,629
How about that one?
- Still a bad joke.

173
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,316
How's that?

174
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:51,661
How's this?

175
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,175
That car carrying the gold.
When does it reach the highway?

176
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,675
l don't know.
- Say it.

177
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,685
Eleven!

178
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:13,346
The number on the license plates?
- MRH 7241 .

179
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,187
Not the real number. The fake one.

180
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,538
Now that you've helped the law...

181
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:32,702
the law will take care of your
livelihood for the next 15 years

182
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,759
You sound cheerful today, Mohan.
What gives?

183
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,429
Good news.
- Go on.

184
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:30,760
l'm getting married
- ln our profession, that's tough.

185
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:36,270
Ever thought of that?
- This is my last day on the job

186
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:43,274
l'm quitting.
- Congratulations.

187
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,283
Careful. Checkpost coming up

188
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:05,959
Here's the way bill.
Please, l'm in a hurry

189
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:13,299
Do you get paid for mumbling?

190
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:17,807
l get paid for going to sleep.

191
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:22,642
Go home and go to sleep.
- l can't sleep at home. Because...

192
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,152
the gold is in here.

193
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:30,322
What do you mean?
- l'll explain. Open the truck.

194
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:09,196
Talk about slaughtering the enemy,
and you get killed by your own kin.

195
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,434
Heard you've been playing
hide and seek with the police

196
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,344
Where's the stuff?

197
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:12,488
The shining star in our firmament.

198
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:24,161
l'm very happy with you.
But l'm very unhappy about you.

199
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:29,833
l shall never forget
what your men did today.

200
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:36,173
Are you talking about Mohan?
- He served you all his life.

201
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:43,013
He slogged to fill your coffers.
And today, you kill him like a dog?

202
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:47,857
l didn't kill him, Amar.
He walked to his own death

203
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:56,026
Any man who gets captured
by the police...

204
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:00,037
poses a threat for me
and my organization.

205
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:04,202
And l always counter threats
before their time.

206
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,377
So according to you,
human life has no value?

207
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:14,882
Our organization doesn't need humans.
We need men who can perform.

208
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:20,717
Conscience, love, friendship
are meaningless for us.

209
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,552
For us the police means death.
Why don't you understand that?

210
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:30,400
Mohan was cornered. Through him,
the police could've reached us.

211
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,570
All we did was to remove
their stepping stone.

212
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,075
For all these years,
l've been kept in the dark.

213
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:44,745
l didn't know you're so inhuman.
l cannot abide by your principles

214
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:51,748
l'm leaving your organization.
- Foolish! You can leave me...

215
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:55,417
only after you're dead.

216
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:01,594
l'm doing it now.

217
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:06,592
Strike the name Amar out
of your diaries.

218
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:10,266
Do you know the consequences?
- Anything worse than death?

219
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:45,302
l could've killed him too.
But l want him alive

220
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:50,640
What if he informs the police?
- He won't. He's brave.

221
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:56,377
My threats didn't stop him. The police
won't be able to make him speak

222
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:14,890
Darling, why are you crying?
- Papa, l thought you aren't coming.

223
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,734
Sorry darling, l'm late.

224
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,738
Come, let's go.

225
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,089
Tina, where are we going
for the holidays?

226
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:44,420
Did Mummy love me?

227
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:50,756
Yes. She used to love you
very much

228
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:55,932
How did she look?
- Very pretty. Just like you.

229
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,298
Are you hurt?

230
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:47,146
l can't give you my heart.
- The bill.

231
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:51,152
Can't give you that either.
''ghoosa lagakey''

232
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:55,829
What's ''ghoosa lagakey''?
- My pet one-liner

233
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:08,845
Ms Sheila, there's magic
in your voice.

234
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:11,344
l'm crazy about your voice

235
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:13,846
Autograph, please

236
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:17,509
So you're interested in music too?
l thought you're just a boxer.

237
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:22,189
No, l'm not.
But l would've become one.

238
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:28,187
What does that mean?
- My father. He boxed me in.

239
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:31,197
Your father is a boxer too?
- Boxer? Who, my father?

240
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:34,700
All he did was to sit behind
the cash counter...

241
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:38,200
and he fleeced his customers
of every penny he could

242
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:41,870
But at the end of the day, he was
still trying to make ends meet.

243
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:50,882
So he's the one who started this cafe?
- And he made my life hell.

244
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:57,552
l would've been a champion today!
l would've floored Sonny Liston.

245
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:02,156
Joe Frazier would've been
no match for me.

246
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:07,067
l would've sent...

247
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,401
Mohammed Ali packing.

248
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:14,069
Mohammed Ali became Mohammed Ali
after the prize fights.

249
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:18,404
My father named me Mohammed Ali
when l was born.

250
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,590
Here come the hoodlums!
They are trouble

251
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,598
But you're a boxer.
Why are you afraid?

252
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:39,591
l'm not afraid about
getting beaten up.

253
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:43,603
But if l hit them,
they are going to die.

254
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,603
Don't you worry.
l'll fix them right away

255
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:02,622
Didn't you see the sign?
The cafe is closed. Go away

256
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:10,288
Look, it's going to be bad
if l get angry. Go away

257
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,978
You cowards

258
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:26,145
Aren't you ashamed?
l'm calling the police

259
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:32,318
We're here. What use calling
the police, darling?

260
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:35,151
What an attitude!

261
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,405
Don't you want to know my stats?

262
00:46:57,114 --> 00:47:00,515
You forgot to ask me on the way.
That's why l'm here.

263
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:05,852
To settle the account.
- ls he teaching us accountancy?

264
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:10,684
No. l'm here to settle the accounts

265
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:16,362
His engine is overheating!
- lt's kicking up such a racket.

266
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:23,036
You fellows are the ones
who have been kicking up a racket

267
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:28,708
Now he's going to fix your silencer.

268
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:42,725
This is my daughter. Tina

269
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,359
My Papa is very strong.

270
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,596
What's your name?
- Sheila.

271
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,287
You're a fine boxer.

272
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:48,287
Mr Mohammed Ali, l'm willing
to compensate you...

273
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:55,059
for the losses you have incurred.
- Keep it, man

274
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:55,131
l haven't lost anything.
This is capital!

275
00:48:54,998 --> 00:49:00,800
How come?
- My rotten old man glassed me in.

276
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:03,799
Today l'm free! From today,
this cafe is closed

277
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:09,472
And l begin!
lnside the ring!

278
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:15,149
Papa, shall we drop Sheila home?
- Why not?

279
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:20,821
Thank you very much, l can manage.
- Formality is such an irritant.

280
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:25,821
This young man is my new disciple.
Go with him. And don't be formal.

281
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:27,997
You won't be irritated.

282
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,495
You must accept my ''ustad's'' verdict.
- All right.

283
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,022
Here's is my place.

284
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:03,196
Sheila, if the hoods tease you again,
just tell me and my Papa.

285
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,528
Why me? You alone are enough.

286
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,532
Sheila, do you live here all alone?

287
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,870
Yes.
- When Papa goes away to work,...

288
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,948
even l live all alone.

289
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,551
Why, where's your Mummy?

290
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,215
l don't have a Mummy.

291
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,732
Sheila, can l come to your house
to meet you?

292
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,891
Sure darling.
Whenever you want.

293
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:37,632
Rajesh, l'm getting
out of here tomorrow.

294
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:42,470
l have a fabulous assignment for you.
Only you can pull it off.

295
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,314
You'll make it rich, my friend

296
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:50,478
l'll wait for you.

297
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:32,862
l hope she isn't bothering you?

298
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,040
She loves you very much.

299
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:48,703
She's so engrossed with you, that she
has forgotten that she has a father

300
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:57,716
She's lucky.
- What's luck got to do with it?

301
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:03,548
lt's said that a woman's love
can change a man's destiny.

302
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:08,898
Love changes a man's luck.

303
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:45,734
Remember me?

304
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:50,895
Who can forget a face like that?
- My wife thinks so too.

305
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:54,068
Then you should spend
some more time with her

306
01:01:54,944 --> 01:02:00,075
How l'd love to do that!
But l happen to be a policeman.

307
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:03,085
And l have to take care
of folks like you

308
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:07,411
Does the government pay you
to make life miserable for me?

309
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:11,260
Get lost, man!

310
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:16,925
Get going. This is a big bad city.

311
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:21,600
Someone might be getting robbed now.
Someone might be getting raped.

312
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:26,100
lmpossible! As long as
you are here,...

313
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,944
nothing can go wrong in the city

314
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,455
Can l give you a lift somewhere?
- The last time, you gave me...

315
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:41,523
a lift upto the jail. Enough for me.

316
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:43,792
This time, l'll drop you home.

317
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:49,287
You can take a ride on a police car
to jail. Not home.

318
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:58,136
The next six months
For the next six months...

319
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:02,305
twice a week... you will report
to the Bandra Police Station.

320
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:06,482
This is crazy.

321
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:10,148
Never again, as long as l live,...

322
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:14,482
would l like to see your face, sir

323
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:18,649
Twice a week.
You must!

324
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:12,711
Nice bike.

325
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,385
Have you renewed your license?

326
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:22,717
l'll do it for you.
Get going.

327
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:47,746
Look ahead. Ahead lies the road.
- But my destination is on my pillion.

328
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:52,247
Now you will be gentleman,
and you will take me home.

329
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:55,082
What are your intentions?
- Only good intentions

330
01:04:55,625 --> 01:05:00,085
The guest will be fed,
and made to feel at home.

331
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:04,592
And what else will you do?
Come on Sheila, say it.

332
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:24,780
What if the bike crashed?
- l would've trying to save you.

333
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:30,281
And the crowds would've celebrated
the dead lover.

334
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:43,632
Tell me, did you miss me?

335
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:49,801
l know you didn't.
But l was so lonely.

336
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:57,149
l can't live without you, Rajesh.
- Then the next time l go to jail...

337
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,320
l'll take you along.
- You mean you'll do it again?

338
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:06,150
l haven't decided anything as such.
But who can do anything about luck?

339
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:12,156
Make yourself mighty
So mighty that before He decides...

340
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:16,493
your Maker shall ask of you
Speak thy mind.

341
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:21,836
Lofty ideals and poetry?
What's happening to you?

342
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:27,846
Been seeing a poet of late?
- Well, l did meet someone

343
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:34,846
Who?
- Young and handsome like you.

344
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:38,853
He speaks poetry.
And he has a way with words.

345
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:56,872
Rajesh, what happened?
Are you angry?

346
01:06:57,413 --> 01:07:01,042
l was justjoking.
- l don't like jokes like that.

347
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,218
Sorry.

348
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:06,054
l won't crack jokes like that
ever again.

349
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:09,884
Now get up. Are you going
to sit here all day?

350
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,829
Come in.

351
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,738
Yes?
- We're here to escort you.

352
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:31,246
Where to?
- You've been invited to a feast.

353
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:37,085
l don't like eating out.
Enjoy yourselves.

354
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:47,425
Strange humor! What's this?
A feast or a farce?

355
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:49,924
You'll know when you get there.
Come on.

356
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:54,770
Don't worry, Sheila.
l'll be back soon

357
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:57,772
Shall we?

358
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:15,286
Look, l'm being very polite with you.
This isn't necessary

359
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,459
Please put it away.
lt scares me

360
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:30,305
Why are you folks so serious?
We're going to a party

361
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,374
Let's talk about the good life

362
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:35,644
No...?

363
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:02,166
l'm sorry for putting you
through all this trouble

364
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:06,504
l just wanted to see who my host is.
That's why l came

365
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:13,348
Nice gun

366
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:20,855
Vicky, l like your friend

367
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,517
My sister, Princess Jwala

368
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:30,697
My brother is all praise for you.
So l invited you

369
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:36,026
And this is how you
invite your guests?

370
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:41,206
- What about your other style?
- Welcome

371
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:55,390
Do you know who he is?

372
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:01,886
Once l lost a bet to him.
Worth fifty cents

373
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:05,059
Fifty cents? He's worth millions

374
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:12,238
My bets are based on
my assessment of worth

375
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:16,236
And you're right.
Fifty cents is all he's worth

376
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:21,071
But there's jewelry worth 10 million
locked inside his safe

377
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:24,351
And it's rightfully mine

378
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:29,257
l hear you work magic
with your fingers, and...

379
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:36,086
locks dance to your tune
and doors spring open

380
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:41,597
So you want me open the safe?

381
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:46,102
Yes
- Friend, here's 50,000.

382
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:51,769
Advance 500,000 more
after the job is done

383
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:04,948
Please do the job as soon as you can

384
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:10,295
You seem to be in a big hurry.
You see, l'm just out ofjail

385
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:14,460
Keep the money now.
Let's talk later

386
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:20,631
You keep it. Till the money stays
with you, we'll remember each other

387
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:30,144
Would you mind if l played
the drums tonight?

388
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:31,820
Certainly

389
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:36,150
Would you still mind?

390
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:40,495
No! Not at all

391
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:45,663
l guessed so.
