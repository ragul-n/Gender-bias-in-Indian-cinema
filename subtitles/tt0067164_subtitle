1
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:24,354
I cannot tolerate indiscipline!

2
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:27,767
Aren't you in charge of
the school prayer?

3
00:07:28,602 --> 00:07:29,330
I am.

4
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:33,968
So? Is that all you have to say?
Explain why! Explain yourself!

5
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:41,973
Vegetables, cooked, fed father,
then I left. That's why I'm late

6
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:44,344
You have to do all that?

7
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:46,308
No, my sister-in-law does.

8
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,654
Then, and so?!

9
00:07:48,388 --> 00:07:51,084
Bhabhi is very ill.
She has a high fever.

10
00:07:52,025 --> 00:07:53,856
That is why I had to do it all...

11
00:07:55,462 --> 00:08:02,868
Bhabhi is ill.
What do you care?!

12
00:08:03,537 --> 00:08:08,099
I've broken rules,
punish me!

13
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:11,739
It's very fair. Very fair...!

14
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:18,978
I'm sorry Kusum. I didn't
know this. Go, go to class.

15
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,011
Thank you, M'am (teacher)

16
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:34,926
So young and such responsibility!
She has no mother... poor girl.

17
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:38,236
Poor girl.
- No, the poor girl.

18
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:44,073
Kusum is surely detained...
she'll stay back for 2 hours.

19
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:47,010
Hi, Tara.
- What happened Kusum?

20
00:08:47,381 --> 00:08:48,939
Nothing really!
- Did you apologize?

21
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:56,452
On the contrary! She did! She
said I'm sorry Kusum, go to class!

22
00:08:57,658 --> 00:08:59,819
How did you manage that?!

23
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,065
I conned her so well, I could
have put Meena Kumari to shame!

24
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,496
Hey, don't we have
Ms. Choudhari now?

25
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,273
Lets faf right at the back!
She'll sit with a novel and say.

26
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,733
Write an essay of 5 pages!

27
00:09:27,454 --> 00:09:32,482
Sit down. I'll take
the roll call later.

28
00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:36,654
- First write an essay - 5 pages
Topic?

29
00:09:38,231 --> 00:09:42,065
The Roll of Cinema on the Public.

30
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:49,272
It's Saturday. Let's go see a movie.
- Which one?

31
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:52,010
"The Man" Dilip and Waheeda.

32
00:09:52,412 --> 00:09:53,811
Dilip Kumar?! Oh wow!!

33
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:54,973
Why?

34
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:59,010
Oh it's a good movie,
just too slow...

35
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:07,324
Shahenshah Saleem cannot sacrifice
his lady love for Hindustan...

36
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:17,533
Bury me alive,
but my love is undying! Finale!

37
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,700
Kusum, what's happening there?!

38
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:23,502
They're talking about the movies
Madam!

39
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:28,008
Yes Ma'am, it's about the essay.
We're exchanging notes.

40
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:30,213
Right. All right.
That will do.

41
00:10:34,688 --> 00:10:35,916
Come on, will you go with us?

42
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:37,952
No, Bhabi might get mad.

43
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:39,886
You can tell her
you were studying at Tara's.

44
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:42,252
No, I wouldn't lie to her.

45
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:43,756
But you did, the last week!!

46
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,095
That was for "Anupama".
I'll go if we watch "Anupama".

47
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:48,163
That's the second time!?

48
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:58,067
So? Look how Dharmendra has acted!
"Anupama" it is then.

49
00:12:08,348 --> 00:12:10,111
Guddi...
- Yes, daddy?

50
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:15,078
You're so late.
- We had special classes daddy.

51
00:12:15,455 --> 00:12:16,922
Final exams are approaching...

52
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,125
But then you could inform us, dear.
We worry, you know...

53
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:26,260
Bhabhi has been up and down
worried sick. Right... go on...

54
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:31,970
Bhabhi... I'm starved. I'd like
something quickly...

55
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:36,999
You've dumped your books again!

56
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:39,005
How often have I to stop you...

57
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:48,185
Sorry, Bhabhi.
- "Anupama"?

58
00:12:50,156 --> 00:12:51,418
Bhabhi, give me your hand...

59
00:12:55,095 --> 00:12:56,528
What's that for?

60
00:12:57,097 --> 00:12:59,224
I had this ugly thought
in the morning!

61
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:02,764
You were feverish and
I was looking after you!

62
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:05,498
There now, I bit the ill
feeling away.

63
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:08,296
Which one? The fever -
or the care?!

64
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:13,211
Both...! Abracadabra boo!!

65
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,380
OK.
Where have you been today?

66
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:21,344
Today? We had special classes,
we were given a test.

67
00:13:21,655 --> 00:13:25,147
But when I went to school, I was told
you had a half day at 01.30 hrs?

68
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:29,259
Father said you went up and down ten
times. When did you go to school?

69
00:13:29,796 --> 00:13:35,132
You little liar. Yet again
you went for a movie. Who with?

70
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:37,467
Lata and Tara.

71
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:45,371
Guddi, look, if you don't do well,
I will be blamed.

72
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:49,271
People will think that no one really
cared for you except your mother.

73
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:54,344
Am I not like your mother?

74
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,421
Oh Bhabhi, this will never
repeat again.

75
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:00,692
Wait and see,
I'll top the class.

76
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,829
So what's up, everybody?
I'm famished.

77
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:12,336
Guddi, look what I've brought.

78
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:13,465
What's it, Bhaiyya?

79
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:22,045
Wait...!
A frock!

80
00:14:22,349 --> 00:14:25,216
Thank you so much!
...Bhabhi!

81
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:27,310
Look at what Bhaiyya bought.

82
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:30,383
Beautiful, wonderful,
one sea two flowers.

83
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:30,988
What's all this?

84
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:33,417
Anupama's housefull!!

85
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,119
And where are you going?!
- I'll be back...

86
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:37,157
At least finish eating...?

87
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:46,232
Here you go...
here's your blouse-piece

88
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:53,305
How large is it?
- One meter...?

89
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:57,049
All that much?
I only need 75 cms.

90
00:14:57,684 --> 00:15:00,244
You keep losing weight.
What can I do?

91
00:15:00,553 --> 00:15:03,716
When was I all that plump
that I needed one meter?

92
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,490
Hey what are you doing - hey!!

93
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,098
She worships you, you've
bought her a new dress!

94
00:15:16,369 --> 00:15:17,700
I see, and where did you
pick that up from?

95
00:15:17,904 --> 00:15:20,566
From Bhabhi! Like it, Bhabhi?
- It's too short.

96
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:25,471
But that's the style! It's a mini!
- No style, nothing.

97
00:15:25,745 --> 00:15:27,872
A young girl should wear a sari.

98
00:15:28,682 --> 00:15:32,709
Malasinha's so much older.
She wears them too!

99
00:15:33,186 --> 00:15:35,746
I'm playing badminton.
I'm with Lata and Tara.

100
00:15:36,923 --> 00:15:39,915
Don't get the girl frocks, please.
She should wear saris.

101
00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:43,789
Girl? What girl, she's my sister!
- Yes but she is like my daughter.

102
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,620
Ah, if you do want
to be a mother...

103
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:49,561
Oh stop teasing...
She's even forgotten to eat!

104
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,140
Bhaiyya, telegram.
- A telegram? Oh God!

105
00:15:56,676 --> 00:16:00,976
From whom? In his last letter
Mamaji had mentioned he was ill.

106
00:16:01,748 --> 00:16:04,012
But it is from Mamaji!
- Why? What's wrong?

107
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:07,481
Your brother's arriving!
- Who? Navin?

108
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:13,091
Yes. For some interview.
I'll go fetch him.

109
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:25,731
Go on, I'll follow you

110
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:41,878
Ah Navin, young man, you're here!
Bless you, son!

111
00:16:42,255 --> 00:16:45,918
Where's Kishan? Didn't he fetch you
- Yes he's coming, he's outside.

112
00:16:46,993 --> 00:16:49,791
What's that, Sir!?
What?

113
00:16:50,196 --> 00:16:53,097
Chess hasn't been
played for a year!?

114
00:16:53,466 --> 00:16:54,933
It's not been touched
since I left?

115
00:16:56,069 --> 00:17:01,507
OK, let's see you make a move.
- Right, lets play! Hmmm!

116
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:11,208
You've just arrived
and you've started playing!!

117
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:13,241
Did you meet your sister?

118
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,614
Of course he'll meet her,
where's the hurry?

119
00:17:29,502 --> 00:17:31,129
Where's Navin?
Hasn't he come with you?

120
00:17:31,404 --> 00:17:33,338
He has. He's already playing
chess with father!

121
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,700
It's started! At least father
will have some company now.

122
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:41,512
He's been Ionely since mother
passed away...

123
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:44,750
Why, am I not around?
- Yes, and he's quite bored...

124
00:17:44,984 --> 00:17:45,473
What!?

125
00:17:50,256 --> 00:17:51,587
There's a horse left...

126
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,891
Navin, how's Mamaji?
- All gone.

127
00:17:58,198 --> 00:18:01,099
What!? What happened?
- Lost a horse...

128
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:06,431
A horse!? When did he have a horse?
- Oh, not him, my horse...

129
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:08,138
Statue!

130
00:18:10,143 --> 00:18:11,007
What... what's this?

131
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:16,080
It's our game, father. Until I say
"Over", she does not move!

132
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,915
Give an "Over" dear,
tell her "Over"

133
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:23,144
Over!
- Bahu, get some tea dear.

134
00:18:23,423 --> 00:18:26,085
You're not allowed tea, father,
Doctor's orders!

135
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:31,389
Right, then get some for Navin.
- He can have some when he comes up.

136
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:32,961
Didi...
- Yes.

137
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:33,756
Come here...

138
00:18:42,308 --> 00:18:45,300
Hi Motu! Fatso!
- Who says I'm fat!

139
00:18:45,945 --> 00:18:48,277
So neither am I short.
Look how tall I've grown.

140
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:55,043
Statue! Aaah you moved!
Come here, come here, now!

141
00:18:57,323 --> 00:18:59,052
Dum dum dum!

142
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,819
You're so wicked. I thought I'd
be the first to freeze you and

143
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,654
you had to start... Wait.

144
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:07,730
I'm caught
- let me finish.

145
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:11,164
Papa, please, go on, play later.
- Leave me, naughty, shooo!

146
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:12,234
Why don't you lose?
Pack up, please.

147
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:21,241
You won't finish till its dark
- Oh go on. It's all right. Go.

148
00:19:23,116 --> 00:19:25,277
We'll continue in the night.
- Right.

149
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:32,116
Thank you.
- What for?

150
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:36,055
He almost killed me. You saved me.
I almost lost my horse to him.

151
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:40,361
I'll keep my books.
- Quickly.

152
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:44,901
Didi, oh Didi...

153
00:19:45,872 --> 00:19:49,808
Stop yelling!
- Why should I stop yelling?

154
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:53,509
I've come after so long...
you don't even talk to me?

155
00:19:56,115 --> 00:19:57,241
Stop it, I'll whack you now.

156
00:19:58,751 --> 00:20:01,117
Don't you wash before eating?

157
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:03,815
But I'll have to
wash up after eating.

158
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:04,884
Why do it twice?

159
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:12,259
Navin, how is Mamaji?

160
00:20:12,632 --> 00:20:14,327
OK. He complains a lot.

161
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,467
He says if you had parents
you'd visit more often.

162
00:20:17,937 --> 00:20:22,499
He's only an uncle.
Why would you visit him, he says!

163
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:28,209
That's not it Navin. There's father,
husband's office, Guddi's school...

164
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:29,139
Bhabhi...!

165
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,782
Let's go for a picnic tomorrow.
The way we went last year...

166
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:34,178
Don't you have school?

167
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:39,049
It's a holiday, Bhabhi, and
Bhaiyya might also have a holiday.

168
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:57,137
Bhabhi, may I wear this dress
when I go?

169
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:58,434
No, wear a sari and go.

170
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:01,041
I won't let you go
in half a dress with Navin.

171
00:21:01,614 --> 00:21:05,983
It's a mini. By saying that it's
half, you make it even shorter!

172
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,253
Listen, Guddi,
you are not a baby.

173
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:09,350
Wear the sari.

174
00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:12,347
I won't wear the sari.
- Then you can't go!

175
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,319
Fine, I won't go!

176
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,559
Right, do as you please
you're a grown girl!

177
00:21:24,737 --> 00:21:26,466
Who am I to say anything!?

178
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:45,250
The Government is building a huge
bridge... they want to interview me.

179
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:47,954
What do you have to do with
bridge building.

180
00:21:48,294 --> 00:21:49,989
Naveen is an engineer, father.

181
00:21:50,263 --> 00:21:53,926
Oh, that's right, Masterji had said
you were studying engineering.

182
00:21:54,534 --> 00:21:55,364
Masterji?

183
00:21:55,635 --> 00:21:59,571
Your Uncle - Mamaji, father has
never called him Professor.

184
00:22:02,108 --> 00:22:03,507
Your medicine, father.

185
00:22:03,976 --> 00:22:05,034
Where's Guddi disappeared?

186
00:22:05,778 --> 00:22:07,837
It's a quarter to six.
Doesn't she want to go for the movie?

187
00:22:37,043 --> 00:22:41,605
Bless you child.
Who's lovely child is this Bahu?

188
00:22:41,914 --> 00:22:43,814
It's our own Guddi, Father.
- Really?

189
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,517
Let me take a look.
Turn around dear, turn...

190
00:22:46,953 --> 00:22:51,049
Oh of course, my little girl.
When did you grow up so fast.

191
00:22:51,591 --> 00:22:53,889
How divine you look in a sari.

192
00:22:54,794 --> 00:22:57,490
Hmmm! You call me Guddi and
you make me wear a sari?

193
00:22:57,763 --> 00:23:00,755
OK, no more Guddi,
only Kusum!

194
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:03,264
From now on "Shorty"
will never figure.

195
00:23:03,636 --> 00:23:08,198
Naveen never call Shorty,
I mean Kusum, names again!

196
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:11,537
OK, you guys move along now
It's already six o'clock

197
00:23:12,378 --> 00:23:13,276
Go on!

198
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:31,726
She is a grown girl now.

199
00:23:32,431 --> 00:23:36,367
I guess so, but I don't need
anxiety about her marriage

200
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:39,968
As if you could be bothered.
I am part of the family...

201
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:41,838
It's my responsibility too

202
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,239
And have you thought
of something?

203
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:45,636
Yes, in a way!

204
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:46,411
What? Who!?

205
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:49,942
Naveen!
I'll speak with Mamaji later.

206
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,983
That's nice.
That's a lovely thought bahu

207
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:55,913
Then dowry won't be
such an issue

208
00:23:56,255 --> 00:23:58,723
Masterji is any way
against the idea

209
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:02,486
Bahu, you haven't been to Bombay
in a long while.

210
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:07,363
Listen, wait for Guddi's exams to
get over and then you could take her...

211
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:12,133
to meet Masterji.
You could talk...

212
00:24:12,572 --> 00:24:15,632
But father, we should let Naveen
decide. He should make up his mind.

213
00:24:16,008 --> 00:24:18,602
Why don't you check with him
before leaving?

214
00:24:19,011 --> 00:24:21,445
I will.
Just leave it to me.

215
00:24:35,094 --> 00:24:41,226
Kusum you're annoyed because
we didn't go for a movie?

216
00:24:42,435 --> 00:24:45,029
When you come to Bombay
I'll take you everyday

217
00:24:45,304 --> 00:24:45,668
Lies!

218
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:48,268
I promise.
. believe me!

219
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:53,674
You've spoilt the whole day!
What was wrong with a movie?

220
00:24:54,013 --> 00:24:54,911
Where has it been spoilt?

221
00:24:55,414 --> 00:25:00,147
I think it's been a lovely day.
You've been with me!

222
00:25:00,486 --> 00:25:02,317
As if I wouldn't be
with you at the movies.

223
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:04,180
Yeah... but the crowd...

224
00:25:04,523 --> 00:25:07,617
You don't want crowds
at the movies??

225
00:25:07,693 --> 00:25:10,560
Yes. That's why I've brought you here.
You could get lost in there...

226
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:14,197
Get lost? Am I a baby?
- Yes. You haven't understood why...

227
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:21,201
We chose the movies?
- I did understand. I'm not daft!

228
00:25:21,841 --> 00:25:22,637
Prove it!

229
00:25:22,942 --> 00:25:25,410
Prove it?
You dislike movies.

230
00:25:25,645 --> 00:25:27,738
You prefer these ruins,
statues and...

231
00:25:29,248 --> 00:25:38,452
Kusum, think, these ruins are
thousands of years old.

232
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:50,927
Today, you and I stand here with...
- Naveen!

233
00:25:51,337 --> 00:25:53,737
Oh that's the same dialogue in
the movie "Night has to fall"...

234
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,036
You can think of
nothing except movies!

235
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,078
I know. I do like
them a great deal!

236
00:26:00,346 --> 00:26:02,746
The noise and action,
song and dance!

237
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:05,313
OK, sing a song!
- No, not now. Perhaps tomorrow.

238
00:26:05,551 --> 00:26:07,542
But I leave tomorrow.
- Why?

239
00:26:08,354 --> 00:26:11,118
Stay back a day?
Nothing's urgent!

240
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:15,417
I've got the interview, remember,
just watch me become an engineer...

241
00:26:15,928 --> 00:26:20,865
Build a bridge across the river,
go for a boat ride each day...

242
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:24,262
Will you take me?
- Definitely.

243
00:26:24,704 --> 00:26:26,262
Promise?
- Promise.

244
00:26:26,772 --> 00:26:31,573
But for now, sing for me.
What are you thinking of?

245
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:35,408
Which film song to sing!
- Oh no, not a film song!..

246
00:26:35,748 --> 00:26:36,305
Why not?

247
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:39,445
They all sound the same, fifty
violins screeching...

248
00:26:40,052 --> 00:26:41,679
That classical one...

249
00:26:41,954 --> 00:26:46,015
Which one? ..."Paapi hara"?
- Yes!

250
00:30:30,749 --> 00:30:34,583
Tell me. Why don't you tell me?
- Don't hassle me.

251
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,984
Didi, how should I know?

252
00:30:36,322 --> 00:30:38,483
You wouldn't know
whether you like her?

253
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:40,448
She's alright,
I guess.

254
00:30:41,226 --> 00:30:44,787
So then you do fancy her!
Shall I speak with Mamaji?

255
00:30:46,532 --> 00:30:47,829
Tea!
- Thank you!

256
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:49,395
Huh! Thank you!

257
00:30:49,802 --> 00:30:51,292
Can't wait a day longer.

258
00:30:51,637 --> 00:30:53,901
And he belts out orders as if
he's at a restaurant...

259
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:59,940
Look, you couldn't get
a better girl than my sis-in-law!

260
00:31:00,446 --> 00:31:02,209
I'll write to
Mamaji tomorrow

261
00:31:02,815 --> 00:31:06,478
As if that's important!
Have you asked her?

262
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:09,182
I could, for your sake!

263
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:12,922
You talk as if you've been
bribed by the in-laws!

264
00:31:13,225 --> 00:31:15,056
My in-laws could be yours too!

265
00:31:15,361 --> 00:31:17,921
If they become mine,
then you are done for!

266
00:31:20,633 --> 00:31:21,827
Is that right?

267
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:31,809
Who's this?
Hema Malini.

268
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,006
What happened
- Nothing. Jitendra's photo.

269
00:31:38,651 --> 00:31:39,481
Good God!

270
00:31:40,452 --> 00:31:43,182
Kusum, do you know,
when Jitendra had fever,

271
00:31:43,522 --> 00:31:46,821
I rubbed his photo with
a wet towel!

272
00:31:50,262 --> 00:31:53,129
So, if Rajesh Khanna had
sore eyes what would you do?

273
00:31:53,198 --> 00:31:58,500
I would give my life for him,
right Kusum!?

274
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:01,871
Wrong number!
It's Dharmendra over there!

275
00:32:02,841 --> 00:32:05,105
No Dharmendra, nothing.

276
00:32:05,477 --> 00:32:10,176
The exams come galloping. If I
don't do well, my Bhabhi's blamed.

277
00:32:12,685 --> 00:32:18,988
No films and no stars
for a month Just sit and mug.

278
00:32:21,627 --> 00:32:25,620
You want to fall sick?
You are reading day and night

279
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:27,460
I've got to come first,
right Bhabhi?

280
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,931
Go on, get some air...
- Kusum...

281
00:32:31,937 --> 00:32:34,132
Tara, take her out with you...

282
00:32:37,242 --> 00:32:40,837
Kusum, there's a shoot at the fort
tomorrow. Coming?

283
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:44,780
No, there are exams and classes...

284
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,684
Waheeda and Dharmendra
will be there!

285
00:32:48,387 --> 00:32:49,649
Dharmendra?
- Yes.

286
00:32:49,988 --> 00:32:52,684
How do you know?
- My brother said so. He knows them.

287
00:32:53,158 --> 00:32:57,219
Will he let us see the shoot?
- Why not? I'll tell him.

288
00:32:57,563 --> 00:32:58,655
Kundan Bhaiyya's at home?

289
00:32:58,997 --> 00:33:00,123
Yes.
- So let's catch him.

290
00:33:08,207 --> 00:33:10,971
What have you worn
- you sample!

291
00:33:11,543 --> 00:33:16,947
This? You wouldn't understand!
It's the latest Shammi Kapoor style.

292
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:22,518
Kundan, why don't you get a job?

293
00:33:22,988 --> 00:33:25,456
It's 2 years since
you stopped studying.

294
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:29,650
Studies wouldn't help
your son, Mother...

295
00:33:30,562 --> 00:33:36,159
Most people do not have
what I have!

296
00:33:36,735 --> 00:33:39,363
And which of your qualities
have I missed out on?

297
00:33:40,572 --> 00:33:45,236
The whole world has seen them, Mom,
This face and this voice...

298
00:33:45,577 --> 00:33:50,071
that's all a hero really needs!
Film offers should pour in soon!

299
00:33:51,617 --> 00:33:54,108
They've spoken to Sadhana

300
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:59,284
Sadhana? Sadhana who?
Bunty's aunt?

301
00:34:00,392 --> 00:34:05,523
Oh mother! Sadhana the great,
the great film star

302
00:34:06,832 --> 00:34:11,895
It's not long before you'll have
a car and a bungalow, trust me!

303
00:34:12,504 --> 00:34:17,305
You haven't given birth to a son...
you've given birth to a phenomenon!

304
00:34:18,377 --> 00:34:23,838
Do you have 10 rupees?..
Quick mom, I have an appointment

305
00:34:24,249 --> 00:34:31,178
That's like a sweet girl!
Thank you mom...!

306
00:34:35,961 --> 00:34:40,864
Bhaiyya take us for that film shoot!?
- No, You might be a disturbance...

307
00:34:41,233 --> 00:34:43,997
No disturbance, Bhaiyya,
we'll watch from far...

308
00:34:44,536 --> 00:34:45,833
Oh, you girls do not understand...

309
00:34:46,505 --> 00:34:51,875
When acting, if there is disturbance,
the actor loses out an expression.

310
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:53,107
I mean...

311
00:34:53,445 --> 00:34:55,845
Oh, go on Bhaiyya,
you're faffing...

312
00:34:56,215 --> 00:34:57,682
I doubt if anyone
even knows you there!

313
00:34:58,116 --> 00:34:59,606
No one knows me?

314
00:35:02,387 --> 00:35:07,654
There's Dharmendra,
Dharmendra does what I say...

315
00:35:08,627 --> 00:35:11,221
Anyway... who's going?

316
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:14,858
Only ten of us...
- Any teacher?

317
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:15,792
No.

318
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:20,733
Right, I'll inform Quader
the Controller of Production.

319
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:28,109
Quader Bhai...

320
00:35:28,814 --> 00:35:31,908
Have you anything for me?
- Don't worry,

321
00:35:32,284 --> 00:35:34,980
I've got lots of sets
I'll be shooting on...

322
00:35:35,254 --> 00:35:37,381
Could you begin shooting soon?
- How can I begin so quickly?

323
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:42,657
I'm short on 4-5000/- rupees. Once
I manage that, we start next month.

324
00:35:43,028 --> 00:35:44,893
We've got Dharam though...
- Dharam?

325
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,961
Dharmendra, our dear friend?

326
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:50,065
I'll give you a chance a side role
- Thanks a lot...

327
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:51,936
What was that?
- Thank you...!

328
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:57,872
One favor... if you could manage
Rs.4- 5000/-, go to Bombay and

329
00:35:58,143 --> 00:35:59,201
deposit it at Ranjit Studio...

330
00:35:59,478 --> 00:36:00,604
Which one?
Ranjit Studio.

331
00:36:00,946 --> 00:36:01,970
Yes, go there and ask for Quaderbhai...
Who?

332
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:03,111
Quaderbhai.
- Right.

333
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:04,347
And where does
Quaderbhai live?

334
00:36:04,616 --> 00:36:07,517
Anyone could tell you,
and I'll set the mahurat!

335
00:36:08,387 --> 00:36:09,877
Quaderbhai...
- Yes?

336
00:36:10,188 --> 00:36:14,522
One question...
Will Sadhana be my heroine?

337
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:18,055
You amaze me! She is a
proposal for another picture

338
00:36:18,363 --> 00:36:19,728
This one's got our - Baby!

339
00:36:20,032 --> 00:36:22,364
Baby?
- Baby Naaz?!

340
00:36:22,668 --> 00:36:24,295
No... No...

341
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,203
Then?

342
00:36:26,505 --> 00:36:28,803
Sharmila...!
- Sharmila...!?

343
00:36:29,074 --> 00:36:32,908
Yes, Sharmila. We call her Baby!
- My God!!

344
00:36:33,245 --> 00:36:34,644
She pesters each day,

345
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,440
Quaderbhai when do we start, when?
When do you become producer?

346
00:36:37,749 --> 00:36:39,410
I haven't had the chance,
you see!

347
00:36:39,751 --> 00:36:42,049
Now that you'll manage this
finance we start immediately.

348
00:36:43,188 --> 00:36:47,215
Quader!
Can we have some tea?

349
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:54,690
Dharmendra - our friend!
He only drinks the tea I bring him!

350
00:36:55,734 --> 00:36:56,962
I'll have to go...

351
00:37:04,476 --> 00:37:06,273
What had you said in English?

352
00:37:06,578 --> 00:37:07,306
Thanks a lot...

353
00:37:07,713 --> 00:37:08,737
Lot!

354
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:23,090
Kusum? Pen.
- You're all from one school?

355
00:37:23,362 --> 00:37:23,885
Yes.

356
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,489
You all haven't done
the bunk, have you?

357
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:29,028
No, we've taken leave.

358
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:34,937
You've got a great teacher if
she leaves you to see a shoot!

359
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:39,538
No, no. We've had a half day.
Our principal expired!

360
00:37:44,449 --> 00:37:47,077
I used to say the same thing
when I'd go watch a hockey match.

361
00:37:47,753 --> 00:37:51,780
I've killed just
as many principals!

362
00:37:54,593 --> 00:37:56,993
Where's Waheeda?
- Tch! Tch!

363
00:37:57,396 --> 00:38:00,229
She's older, you say
Waheedaji!

364
00:38:00,565 --> 00:38:01,088
Sorry

365
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:02,593
That's all right. She's over there.

366
00:38:03,835 --> 00:38:08,135
You've forgotten your pen...
- Thank you.

367
00:38:13,345 --> 00:38:17,748
Don't you want to meet Waheedaji?
- Autograph.

368
00:38:18,884 --> 00:38:22,911
What's this..."Anupama"!?
You've seen it?

369
00:38:23,321 --> 00:38:24,686
Three times.

370
00:38:25,023 --> 00:38:28,857
Good God! Bunking school?
- No.

371
00:38:29,294 --> 00:38:30,056
Then how?

372
00:38:30,629 --> 00:38:33,826
Once with my family
- And the remaining...!

373
00:38:36,368 --> 00:38:38,768
So, did you like "Anupama"?
- Very much.

374
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:41,495
And the other movies you've seen?

375
00:38:42,274 --> 00:38:45,971
Phool aur Pathar",
"Deewar", "Bandini"...

376
00:38:46,278 --> 00:38:47,245
All your movies!

377
00:38:47,612 --> 00:38:54,017
Your pen please... your name?
- Kusum.

378
00:38:55,587 --> 00:39:04,495
Kusum... with love... date?
- 6th.

379
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:09,232
6/6/...
- '70

380
00:39:09,534 --> 00:39:12,970
'70
- Thank you.

381
00:39:13,238 --> 00:39:13,932
Happy?

382
00:39:16,274 --> 00:39:17,571
Thank you very much.

383
00:41:37,382 --> 00:41:40,783
Meera's love is immortal.

384
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:49,021
His image haunted her, he was
her guide, her reason to live...

385
00:41:49,561 --> 00:41:51,085
Did Meera marry?
Teacher...

386
00:41:52,831 --> 00:42:04,470
Yes, for social norms, but she never
gave her husband conjugal bliss.

387
00:42:04,943 --> 00:42:08,902
That is why she writes, "You are
my eternity, Girdhar Gopal.

388
00:42:09,247 --> 00:42:14,776
"There is no one else,
Not even my husband."

389
00:42:16,354 --> 00:42:19,118
Didn't Meera's household
have objections?

390
00:42:19,758 --> 00:42:25,526
The question didn't arise.
Meera's love was true.

391
00:42:25,864 --> 00:42:33,327
Truth beckons the Lord and all
worldly ties are broken.

392
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:37,631
Man emerges stronger...

393
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:49,345
My love is pure. I've always loved
you and each of your photographs.

394
00:42:50,889 --> 00:42:55,849
That's why I see
all your movies.

395
00:42:58,029 --> 00:43:03,661
Meera breaks worldly ties and
searches Gopal.

396
00:43:04,336 --> 00:43:08,534
I bunk school and run to see
your movies...

397
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:15,943
My love for you is true like Meera's.
I know you're married,

398
00:43:16,881 --> 00:43:23,582
but I do not grudge your wife.
She's like my sister.

399
00:43:24,589 --> 00:43:26,523
And your children...

400
00:43:26,925 --> 00:43:30,122
What are you
muttering all alone?

401
00:43:30,395 --> 00:43:32,920
Nothing Bhabhi. We've got
a dissertation on Meera.

402
00:43:33,365 --> 00:43:35,094
Write your essay later.
Wear this sari now.

403
00:43:41,673 --> 00:43:43,732
But, it's made of silk...
- Yes, so?

404
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:50,044
I've sworn not to wear silk.
- Why?

405
00:43:51,049 --> 00:43:54,746
It's a vow, a sacrifice Bhabhi.
I am content.

406
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,446
You're to write an essay on Meera,
or become a hermit?

407
00:43:58,857 --> 00:43:59,755
Go on, wear the sari.

408
00:44:04,095 --> 00:44:06,723
You wouldn't understand Bhabhi...

409
00:44:07,432 --> 00:44:14,338
Truth is the lords strength
and so all ties are broken...

410
00:44:23,882 --> 00:44:24,974
Bhaiyya...

411
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,884
How was it... you seem quite
happy... how was the paper?

412
00:44:28,186 --> 00:44:30,518
First class!
Now we can go to Bombay!

413
00:44:30,855 --> 00:44:33,756
Not with me, with Bhabhi.
- You're not going? Why?

414
00:44:34,058 --> 00:44:36,583
Something's cropped up suddenly.
I'll join you later. Get in.

415
00:44:47,272 --> 00:44:49,467
Exams over?
- Yes.

416
00:44:49,774 --> 00:44:50,934
When are you going to Bombay?

417
00:44:51,176 --> 00:44:53,371
Tomorrow.
- You'll have a lot of fun...

418
00:44:54,078 --> 00:44:58,139
What fun? What's there to do
and see anyway? Only the sea...

419
00:44:58,483 --> 00:45:01,111
Why? There's Rajender,
Jeetender, Dharmender.

420
00:45:01,453 --> 00:45:04,183
As if they're all lined
up to welcome me!

421
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:11,590
Kusum...?! Tara?
What's up? Something's wrong!

422
00:45:17,202 --> 00:45:21,161
Bhabhi... Bhabhi...?!
Tara, what's wrong!? What is it?

423
00:45:21,906 --> 00:45:24,340
What's the matter, Tara?
Why are you crying?

424
00:45:24,742 --> 00:45:26,710
I haven't the slightest.
As she entered, she started sobbing!

425
00:45:27,011 --> 00:45:27,773
What's wrong, dear?

426
00:45:28,847 --> 00:45:30,644
Kundan has run away
from home, Bhabhi.

427
00:45:30,915 --> 00:45:33,577
What?
- Yes, with mother's valuables.

428
00:45:33,918 --> 00:45:35,146
From tomorrow, Mother...

429
00:45:35,653 --> 00:45:37,484
Oh my!
Did you all fight?

430
00:45:37,789 --> 00:45:41,452
No, he's left for Bombay.
He's said he'd become a hero there.

431
00:45:42,293 --> 00:45:45,262
Mother says since
you're going to Bombay...

432
00:45:45,563 --> 00:45:46,894
Of course we'll try and find him.

433
00:45:47,198 --> 00:45:50,463
We'll try and bring him back.
Don't cry dear, don't cry.

434
00:46:19,931 --> 00:46:26,837
"Love... love... love... love

435
00:46:31,376 --> 00:46:34,436
Goes on and is alive.

436
00:46:34,812 --> 00:46:41,775
Is at your call

437
00:46:42,654 --> 00:46:48,820
Nothing but love

438
00:46:54,566 --> 00:46:58,627
Love... love...
Iove... love"

439
00:47:20,525 --> 00:47:23,050
"I could give my
life for you Rita"

440
00:47:23,761 --> 00:47:25,854
"I can't live without
you either Rajan".

441
00:47:26,297 --> 00:47:28,458
"You have dared to do this?"
- But father..."

442
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:36,835
"Shut up - nasty girl!
I'll suck you blood!"

443
00:47:41,813 --> 00:47:43,371
"I'll kill you - I'll shoot."

444
00:48:06,404 --> 00:48:08,201
Mamaji, Mamaji!
- Statue!

445
00:48:12,677 --> 00:48:14,611
Didi, you haven't even
stepped in and you're caught!

446
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:19,973
How can you do this, no wishes,
no greetings, no blessings...!

447
00:48:21,052 --> 00:48:23,987
Over - it's over -
bless you child!

448
00:48:24,255 --> 00:48:25,244
Mamaji, statue!

449
00:48:32,463 --> 00:48:38,129
How can you do this...
no greetings, nothing?

450
00:48:39,103 --> 00:48:41,799
No blessings at your feet?
Poor Mamaji!

451
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,001
You can move only
on one condition.

452
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:48,511
Do not move your limbs,
flutter your eyes...

453
00:48:50,148 --> 00:48:52,116
Will you get us ice cream?

454
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,709
Will you take us to the movies?

455
00:49:00,892 --> 00:49:06,262
Anything else, Bhabhi, quick,
tell me... would you like a Maami?

456
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:09,557
Oooh! Over!!

457
00:49:11,969 --> 00:49:15,302
No problem Guddi, I'll catch you
unawares when you get married.

458
00:49:15,606 --> 00:49:16,834
I'm not getting married!

459
00:49:17,141 --> 00:49:19,302
Really? Sure?
Then let's shake on that!

460
00:49:20,812 --> 00:49:22,143
What are you happy about?

461
00:49:22,714 --> 00:49:25,410
One more member to join
the bachelor union!!

462
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:34,080
What's this?
- Pudding.

463
00:49:34,392 --> 00:49:36,622
No, no. I've had enough.
- Take a little...

464
00:49:37,095 --> 00:49:38,221
No, that's enough

465
00:49:38,529 --> 00:49:42,522
Oh Mamaji, do take some. Why do
you feel shy? You're at home...

466
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:52,472
It's hard to believe little Guddi has
grown up until she opens her mouth!

467
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:58,214
That's correct. I'm worried. She's a
young lady who should be married.

468
00:49:58,483 --> 00:49:59,074
Bhabhi!?

469
00:49:59,817 --> 00:50:02,342
What's the hurry?
We'll finish pudding and then...

470
00:50:06,624 --> 00:50:09,024
Have you seen a suitable boy?
- Yes.

471
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:10,555
I've even spoken
about him to father

472
00:50:10,928 --> 00:50:12,725
We need to know how you feel.

473
00:50:13,197 --> 00:50:14,391
Me?
- Yes...!?

474
00:50:17,635 --> 00:50:21,594
Oh! I see!..
Hey where are you going?

475
00:50:23,441 --> 00:50:26,035
My, my!
Women of today do feel shy!

476
00:50:27,345 --> 00:50:29,074
What do you think, Mamaji?

477
00:50:29,347 --> 00:50:36,276
What do I think? Ask him!
So, Don Juan how do you feel?

478
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:38,012
Why ask me?

479
00:50:38,523 --> 00:50:41,151
Why feel shy?
The same thing happened to me.

480
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:45,551
When I did not respond, my family
thought I was disinterested.

481
00:50:46,397 --> 00:50:48,695
The result?
I'm still a bachelor!

482
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,100
Answer convincingly..."Yes"!
Or, "Absolutely yes"!

483
00:50:54,472 --> 00:50:55,530
I don't know.

484
00:51:01,746 --> 00:51:05,113
I have no problem Uma,
just one condition...

485
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:06,344
Which is...?

486
00:51:07,385 --> 00:51:08,784
There will be a dowry!

487
00:51:09,053 --> 00:51:09,610
What?!

488
00:51:13,224 --> 00:51:15,351
After pudding,
I need paan!

489
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,633
Kusum, why are you crying?

490
00:51:37,448 --> 00:51:46,618
This marriage is not happening.
Navin, I cannot marry you.

491
00:51:49,627 --> 00:51:59,298
Don't misunderstand. I do not
want to betray you. I love another.

492
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:10,511
I'm glad you trust me.
Tell me who it is? I could help.

493
00:52:11,816 --> 00:52:15,718
I cannot marry him either,
Navin.

494
00:52:17,622 --> 00:52:19,021
Why?

495
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:22,792
He's married.

496
00:52:23,895 --> 00:52:26,159
What? What are you saying!!

497
00:52:27,565 --> 00:52:28,691
He's got children.

498
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,894
How would you know! Maybe he's
pulling a fast one on you.

499
00:52:33,037 --> 00:52:41,001
No, Navin. He is not.
He cares. He's like God.

500
00:52:43,781 --> 00:52:49,344
Like Meerabai's Krishna!

501
00:52:49,987 --> 00:52:53,718
Kusum, you're naive.
Tell me who it is.

502
00:52:55,026 --> 00:52:58,655
No, Navin. Do not put me in a spot.

503
00:52:58,896 --> 00:53:02,229
Oh stop that acting!
Tell me or I'll blow it!

504
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,626
No...!
- So then tell me!?

505
00:53:10,908 --> 00:53:15,538
Dharmendra.
- Dharmendra... who?

506
00:53:16,147 --> 00:53:19,173
Dharmendra - Sharmila of the movies-
a filmstar...?

507
00:53:21,485 --> 00:53:26,115
Dharmendra!? A film star!
Where's the problem?!

508
00:53:26,557 --> 00:53:27,922
You'll find this fixation
in any home.

509
00:53:32,163 --> 00:53:40,935
Even I remember the film stars
Rajendra Kumar, Asha Parekh...

510
00:53:42,073 --> 00:53:46,237
Shashi Kapoor, Rajesh Khanna.

511
00:53:48,879 --> 00:53:52,747
Guddi's very naive.
Couples look for Dilip Kumar

512
00:53:53,017 --> 00:53:54,575
and Saira Banu replicas in
each other.

513
00:53:55,386 --> 00:53:57,479
Yes, but I haven't harbored
thoughts like that...?

514
00:54:00,291 --> 00:54:05,820
Look Navin, Guddi has no concept.
She's walks on a cloud.

515
00:54:06,464 --> 00:54:07,624
She thinks its all true.

516
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:11,796
It's not.

517
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:15,505
It's infatuation.
It won't last long.

518
00:54:17,074 --> 00:54:20,532
But now I don't want the marriage.

519
00:54:21,412 --> 00:54:26,111
Tell me something.
Do you desire Kusum?

520
00:54:29,053 --> 00:54:31,021
Apart from being your uncle (mama)
I'm your friend.

521
00:54:31,789 --> 00:54:33,051
But Mamaji...
- No buts.

522
00:54:35,893 --> 00:54:38,191
Do you like the girl?
You haven't answered.

523
00:54:39,997 --> 00:54:40,986
Don't you think it's your duty...

524
00:54:41,232 --> 00:54:46,363
to help unknot her?
Help the poor girl.

525
00:54:47,238 --> 00:54:50,765
Forget what you heard.
Don't tell your sister anything.

526
00:54:51,142 --> 00:54:53,940
Act as if nothing happened
between the two of you.

527
00:54:54,979 --> 00:54:58,142
She shouldn't realize that I know
how she feels.

528
00:54:59,116 --> 00:55:01,676
Don't worry. Leave everything
else to me. Go on... go!

529
00:55:14,265 --> 00:55:16,426
Deshpande speaking.

530
00:55:16,934 --> 00:55:21,894
Deshpande, this is Gupta here.
How are you? Have I disturbed you?

531
00:55:22,206 --> 00:55:28,577
No. No not at all. So tell me how
come you thought of me after so long?

532
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:33,214
I need a favor. Aren't they making
a film based on your novel?

533
00:55:33,551 --> 00:55:37,510
Yes. As long as there was
no film, it was my novel.

534
00:55:38,122 --> 00:55:42,991
They've messed it all.
It's unbelievable!

535
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,787
The hero-heroine romance one another
in the most ridiculous manner...

536
00:55:47,231 --> 00:55:51,167
running, chasing and dancing even
if they walk with two left feet.

537
00:55:51,635 --> 00:55:55,127
Oh God... my poor story!

538
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:11,715
The hero chases the villain - in
a car on a bike - on a horse?

539
00:56:12,389 --> 00:56:23,163
And as he walks... they fight!

540
00:56:24,969 --> 00:56:41,478
It's terrible, the fight. I wish
I could die. It's so violent.

541
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:46,589
Oh lord! You poor chap! Anyway
I have nothing to do with your story.

542
00:56:46,891 --> 00:56:47,915
It's your hero, I want.

543
00:56:48,459 --> 00:56:52,896
Who?
- Dharmendra.

544
00:56:53,397 --> 00:56:56,958
Aha, salt and pepper hair and
you fancy autographs now?

545
00:56:57,301 --> 00:57:05,072
No. It's work. My thesis.
Will you make an appointment?

546
00:57:05,609 --> 00:57:08,009
Absolutely. I'll fix something.

547
00:57:08,612 --> 00:57:10,512
Give me a call once you've got
me a day.

548
00:57:33,304 --> 00:57:37,764
One rupee - just a rupee.
I'm blind, one rupee and the lord

549
00:57:38,108 --> 00:57:39,132
will always feed you.

550
00:57:40,444 --> 00:57:42,571
Mister, one moment...

551
00:57:45,015 --> 00:57:46,744
You mean, you can see?

552
00:57:47,117 --> 00:57:53,852
Yes. I can see, walk earn... I'm
not a beggar. I do the make up.

553
00:57:54,191 --> 00:57:54,782
Make up?

554
00:57:55,092 --> 00:57:58,493
That's right. I was memorizing my
lines for a film.

555
00:57:58,829 --> 00:57:59,693
I'm very sorry...

556
00:58:00,164 --> 00:58:01,495
Doesn't matter, that doesn't matter

557
00:58:01,732 --> 00:58:03,222
You seem new around here.

558
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:07,401
Yes. It's my first time.
Is Dharmenderji here in this studio?

559
00:58:07,705 --> 00:58:09,730
Dharmendra... that's his
make up room.

560
00:58:10,107 --> 00:58:15,807
Thank you.
You're welcome. Just a rupee...

561
00:58:16,113 --> 00:58:18,877
I'm blind just a rupee
and the lord will feed you.

562
00:58:26,657 --> 00:58:29,626
Yes?
- I'd like to meet Mr. Dharmender.

563
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,190
Regarding?
- Work. Only with him.

564
00:58:32,463 --> 00:58:34,397
Your name?
- Prof. Gupta.

565
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:39,399
Oh do come in Professor,
what can I do for you?

566
00:58:41,272 --> 00:58:44,673
I'd like to speak with you privately.
- Alone?

567
00:58:45,109 --> 00:58:45,939
For 5 minutes.

568
00:58:46,477 --> 00:58:50,641
Pant Dada, I'll send for you in
5 minutes. Do come this way, sir...

569
00:58:58,555 --> 00:58:59,453
Do tell me...

570
00:58:59,957 --> 00:59:04,826
It's like this; I've got this slight
calamity where only you can help.

571
00:59:06,363 --> 00:59:09,821
The problem is,
I have a niece.

572
00:59:12,002 --> 00:59:13,026
Yes, and...

573
00:59:14,038 --> 00:59:19,476
The problem?
She loves you!

574
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:20,469
What?

575
00:59:21,045 --> 00:59:23,240
Don't be alarmed, she's never
really met with you.

576
00:59:24,148 --> 00:59:25,445
And you say she loves me?

577
00:59:25,916 --> 00:59:28,146
How do you expect me to
believe that, Sir?!

578
00:59:28,419 --> 00:59:33,516
One, just one minute...
listen to what I have to say

579
00:59:34,325 --> 00:59:38,421
It's not only my niece,
but a thousand other girls...

580
00:59:39,096 --> 00:59:41,724
like her who haven't met you
but are crazy about you.
