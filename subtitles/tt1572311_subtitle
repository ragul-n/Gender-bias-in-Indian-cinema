1
00:01:56,807 --> 00:02:02,601
every youth has there hero,

2
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:08,822
who gives everything to them.

3
00:02:09,308 --> 00:02:11,952
this story is about a hero..

4
00:02:12,243 --> 00:02:13,838
I am just kidding.

5
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:29,671
how can you watch these forgery
films,

6
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:31,051
I like them.

7
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:37,000
if you will watch these type of movie,
your baby could get possess.

8
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:39,183
he will become born thief.

9
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:43,635
just like Abhimanu, in Mahabharat.

10
00:02:43,755 --> 00:02:45,404
shut up.

11
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:49,001
my son will become big man.

12
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,956
people will wait long to see him.

13
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:55,144
and when they will see him they
will call the police.

14
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:57,639
let us watch the movie.

15
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:44,283
what happen?
tank broke.

16
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:49,202
not plumber, its my tank.

17
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,975
congrats, you got a son.
and my wife?

18
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:57,785
both are fine,
where is my watch.

19
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:03,404
my chain.

20
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:21,371
we caught the biggest smuggling last night.

21
00:06:22,655 --> 00:06:25,590
thousand years old antique from
our country.

22
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:30,781
diamond, jewelries, paintings. and
the total is.

23
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:36,601
we stop it from being export.

24
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:42,103
the value is around 500 crore. 

25
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:47,963
Interpol has doubt, that all the stuff..

26
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:51,385
is belongs to anti smuggler, Jhori Brothers.

27
00:06:52,242 --> 00:06:55,184
both are not from the people,

28
00:06:55,304 --> 00:06:57,282
who let go of there stuff.

29
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:05,058
they try to get it back, so our job is
not done here.

30
00:07:05,402 --> 00:07:10,608
our next mission will be safe transfer
to the government treasure.

31
00:07:11,109 --> 00:07:14,208
and the name will be, India..

32
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:18,781
Shut up.

33
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:24,604
and the name will be India's treasure.

34
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:32,548
in this mission we have to take the 
treasure in train to Delhi.

35
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:36,388
keep in mind this train will go straight 
to Delhi.

36
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:39,233
it will not stop anywhere.

37
00:07:39,353 --> 00:07:43,172
so there is only one way, for 
Jhori Brothers to get it back.

38
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:46,449
they can only steal from running train.

39
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:48,422
he says anything.

40
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:54,892
everyone knows, they don’t do there
illegal work by them self.

41
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:59,401
they will try to get help from someone.

42
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:03,909
but who is that?

43
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:08,521
who could do this job.

44
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:12,320
in daylight, he could do in the night
time as well.

45
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,419
why, under the nose, he could do
behind back.

46
00:08:15,785 --> 00:08:17,110
right?

47
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,175
only there man can do this job.

48
00:08:23,477 --> 00:08:28,580
the first one is Ismail Sheikh,
aka Ismail Koyla.

49
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:35,312
who is more black have no idea.

50
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,357
he got two weapon.

51
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:43,223
one darkness and other is his smile.

52
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:58,876
you are under arrest.

53
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:03,983
he disappear in the darkness.

54
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:06,060
I think he ran away again.

55
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:10,850
that’s why we never caught him.

56
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:16,256
few years back he try to 
steal in museum.

57
00:09:16,376 --> 00:09:21,213
but this time I had his case.

58
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:25,638
his bad luck or yours?

59
00:09:26,243 --> 00:09:27,903
keep quite and listen.

60
00:09:33,893 --> 00:09:36,888
you are under arrest.

61
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:41,146
but all his tricks were old.

62
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:47,336
Ismail, why don’t you live law full life?

63
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,145
I have mind blowing job for you.

64
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:53,264
you can get Rs. 100000 for one hour.

65
00:09:54,934 --> 00:10:01,654
they want to use you as a train light.

66
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:05,246
there he is..

67
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:10,161
smile please.

68
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:13,983
second candidate is Master India.

69
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:18,699
you mean Mister India, I mean Master India.

70
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:24,598
Mr. India was nice man that his corrupt
son.

71
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:29,095
who is misusing his father's power.

72
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:34,846
he don’t steal in darkness like Ismail,

73
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:40,189
he steal in day light, in front of everyone.

74
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,341
someone stop him,

75
00:10:49,938 --> 00:10:51,638
he is gone.

76
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:59,235
I was after him.

77
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:05,222
and one day finally..

78
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:18,022
I changed his bracelet while hand
shaking.

79
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:34,680
Master India though that he got
disappear.

80
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,038
he was dancing like hell.

81
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:41,348
he didn’t knew that now everyone can 
see him.

82
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:57,226
Commissioner is happy.

83
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:03,447

00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:10,754
also know as Tees Maar Khan.

86
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:15,930
his fan call him half robin hood.

87
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:18,238
why half robin hood?

88
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,828
because he took from reach but don’t
give to poor.

89
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:26,065

Tees Maar Khan.

00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:57,102

00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:31,578
freedom.

157
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,403
you are nothing understanding.

158
00:21:41,612 --> 00:21:44,951
all of you will go to jail,

159
00:21:47,364 --> 00:21:54,189

we cant go home.

163
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:52,143
why? in one hours police will be
at home.

164
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:55,000
I cant handle them more then one hour.

165
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,817
but Anya is not at home.

166
00:23:58,235 --> 00:24:00,100
where is she?
In mehboob studio.

167
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:03,054
she is doing item number,
her craziness of acting.

168
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:08,506
what is the name of the movie?
when Sheela was young.

169
00:24:08,936 --> 00:24:10,045
this dirty name.

170
00:24:11,141 --> 00:24:12,171
let's go Mehboob.

171
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:17,679
take me to Mehboob studio.

172
00:28:59,227 --> 00:29:00,858
who is it?

173
00:29:13,881 --> 00:29:16,855
today that producer was about to sign me.

174
00:29:17,207 --> 00:29:19,542
but where was the contract?

175
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:22,125
in his hotel room?

176
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:26,586
Contract was in his pocket,
only pen was in hotel.

177
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,424
acting is useless.

178
00:29:32,311 --> 00:29:36,576
acting is like chewing gum.

179
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:42,501
first it got taste and then you suffer
for throwing it away.

180
00:29:43,101 --> 00:29:47,040
because you are having it for long,
so you get attach.

181
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,762
leave the acting,

182
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:55,054

272
00:38:21,403 --> 00:38:28,018
there must be 20 to 30 police in that
train.

273
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,450

274
00:38:30,734 --> 00:38:33,666
but how we can carry that much stuff?

275
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:37,788
it can take whole month.

276
00:38:38,518 --> 00:38:40,292
we would need more man.

00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:50,512
we can get these man, but we cant
share our plan with them.

279
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:54,999

315
00:41:41,308 --> 00:41:48,915

story of the movie?

591
01:13:16,945 --> 01:13:19,809
you are white girl.

592
01:13:20,592 --> 01:13:24,280
why she would steal the bank?

593
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,638
because he father is an Indian.

594
01:13:27,758 --> 01:13:31,862

595
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:36,333

01:13:36,453 --> 01:13:40,993

man around.

601
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,643

603
01:14:53,382 --> 01:14:55,236

01:14:55,751 --> 01:14:59,604

605
01:15:00,346 --> 01:15:01,088

01:15:16,939 --> 01:15:20,318
they are killing Indian people.

610
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:26,293

01:15:29,531 --> 01:15:33,157

625
01:18:49,868 --> 01:18:51,949
I just fall in to the character.

626
01:18:52,258 --> 01:18:54,257
I though you will fall in to the camera.

627
01:18:59,931 --> 01:19:02,795

628
01:19:03,701 --> 01:19:05,844

634
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:33,930
that is finished, forget the reel,
no one will know.

635
01:19:35,578 --> 01:19:38,092
Atish and Buntty are in films from
past ten years.

636
01:19:38,508 --> 01:19:41,660
we can handle Atish but buntty is
too much.

637
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:45,781
so what now?

638
01:19:46,111 --> 01:19:49,407
we would need money, like around
5 to 6 lacks.

639
01:19:52,312 --> 01:19:53,157
what is that?

640
01:19:53,816 --> 01:19:57,628

641
01:19:57,748 --> 01:19:58,802

01:20:31,709 --> 01:20:35,521

654
01:20:55,971 --> 01:20:58,052
Hero is Atish Kapoor.

655
01:20:59,330 --> 01:21:01,452
but main role is mine.

656
01:21:01,572 --> 01:21:03,965
I was big fan of this father.

657
01:21:04,448 --> 01:21:08,362

yes I saw him, he was going towards
back with his three friends.

664
01:21:43,588 --> 01:21:47,049

01:21:47,461 --> 01:21:50,820
at that time do only one thing.

666
01:21:51,438 --> 01:21:52,386

01:22:24,879 --> 01:22:26,775
they are saying they will kill us.

672
01:22:26,895 --> 01:22:29,062

677
01:23:33,889 --> 01:23:36,340
ghost without head.

678
01:24:00,684 --> 01:24:05,546
where the Boss is going, I think

679
01:24:07,201 --> 01:24:11,178
see Mr. Director is going towards ghost.

680
01:24:20,573 --> 01:24:23,890

681
01:24:24,199 --> 01:24:28,659
but that’s the ghost, that is the
only problem.

682
01:24:38,425 --> 01:24:43,329

01:58:53,978 --> 01:58:55,974
keep in mind I will run away.

900
01:59:30,629 --> 01:59:33,880
why are you running?

901
02:00:00,805 --> 02:00:03,735
those are poor's money.

902
02:00:05,699 --> 02:00:06,504
let me try.

903
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:04,512
nice film.

904
02:01:23,865 --> 02:01:25,536
congrats to you too.

905
02:01:26,034 --> 02:01:27,393
be safe.

906
02:01:30,552 --> 02:01:32,560
nice movie.

907
02:01:33,463 --> 02:01:35,269
this movie must go in Oscar.

908
02:01:35,539 --> 02:01:37,539
what is Oscar?

909
02:01:37,769 --> 02:01:39,313
I want to touch his legs.

910
02:01:48,029 --> 02:01:50,873
he ran again.!

911
02:02:13,742 --> 02:02:14,535
how you are here?

912
02:02:14,856 --> 02:02:17,059
just like that.

913
02:02:17,179 --> 02:02:23,509
Tees Maar Khan fled again that’s the
26th time.

914
02:02:26,744 --> 02:02:29,216
I can give you one last chance to
fix the hole.

915
02:02:30,162 --> 02:02:30,854
if you guys..

916
02:02:31,335 --> 02:02:33,039
give my cut back.

917
02:02:33,276 --> 02:02:34,955
in a moment.

918
02:02:35,536 --> 02:02:36,515
guard..

919
02:02:45,437 --> 02:02:46,551
what is this nonsense?

920
02:02:49,710 --> 02:02:54,292
now we decide that we are taking over
your money and plane as well.

921
02:02:55,195 --> 02:02:56,393
right captain?

922
02:02:57,217 --> 02:02:58,753
yes Boss.
the Plane.

923
02:03:00,137 --> 02:03:04,989
I found only one parachute, wear it
and jump, fast.. fast..

924
02:03:24,630 --> 02:03:29,795
you cant take bone from the dog,
and money from Tees Maar Khan.
