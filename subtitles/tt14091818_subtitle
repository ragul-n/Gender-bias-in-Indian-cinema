1
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:51,625
LOVER

2
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,208
Our fathers are
quite happy with this marriage.

3
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,958
After all,
it's a profitable deal for them.

4
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:19,125
But I've always loved someone else,
so I won't be able to love you.

5
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,125
I won't allow my father
to be a grandfather,

6
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,666
so don't expect anything from me.

7
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,833
I won't apologize
because in such marriages

8
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,416
everyone has to compromise.

9
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,333
You understand.

10
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,416
Then why did you marry me?

11
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,708
I wasn't given a choice.

12
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,625
So what do you expect from me, then?

13
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,666
To uphold
our families' reputation, that's all.

14
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,791
Why are men
in this country such hypocrites?

15
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,750
If you guys can cheat, you should
have the guts to be cheated on.

16
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:03,166
If I had guts, there'd be
someone else here in your place.

17
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,041
So now I'm supposed to suffer
all my life for your lack of courage?

18
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,416
Look at me.

19
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,875
Happy birthday, Lipakshi.

20
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,416
How do you know it's my birthday?

21
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,375
Because I'm crazy about you.
I know everything.

22
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:51,000
Your age is 25. Zodiac sign, Scorpio.

23
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,750
And your favorite color is green.

24
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,375
I even have a gift for you.

25
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,833
What is it?

26
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,333
Why are you being so shy? Tell me.

27
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,750
It's a sexy nightie.

28
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,250
Just like they wear
in those English movies.

29
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:10,625
And it's green.

30
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,375
Please put it on. It'll be so hot,
I swear on my mother's life.

31
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:19,166
If Babloo comes to know,
he'll put you through some serious pain.

32
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,500
He's gone to Lucknow to meet his uncle.
Tonight there's no pain, only gain.

33
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,583
Please, Lipakshi, dear. Please.

34
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,000
Thank you, Lipakshi.

35
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,041
A dying man's last wish
should always be fulfilled.

36
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,166
-You fucking piece of shit!
-Gopal, sir.

37
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,958
-How dare you!
-Gopal, sir.

38
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,000
Babloo, sir…

39
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,916
I made a huge mistake. Please forgive me.

40
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,583
You call me sir

41
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,041
and then you try to screw my wife.

42
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,625
I messed up, sir. I'm so sorry.

43
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,791
-I'll show you, motherfucker!
-I don't wanna die.

44
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:24,250
-I don't wanna die, sir!
-Cut off his head.

45
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,458
Won't you wish me a happy birthday?

46
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,750
How do I look?

47
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,750
Stop acting so promiscuous.

48
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:45,083
Then do something about it,
so that I won't act like that.

49
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,750
Someday I'm going to kill you myself.

50
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,875
Use your hands.

51
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,750
I don't trust your gun.

52
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,583
It's prone to misfire.

53
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,833
No! I don't want to die! Please!

54
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:22,125
I'll leave Bara Banki
and never come back, I promise.

55
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,625
Please forgive me, sir.
The oil will burn me.

56
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,625
Now listen to me, you dickhead.

57
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,708
Oil has to be hot enough
to fry meat, you get that?

58
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:34,541
I swear on my mother's life, sir.
I'll never even look at your wife again.

59
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,583
Why not?

60
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:41,083
In fact, I want you to look at her
with your hungry, lustful eyes everyday.

61
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,333
So that when you do,
your fried little sausage reminds you

62
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:50,041
of what it means in Bara Banki
to put your eyes on Babloo's wife.

63
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,708
-Lower him.
-Sir. Please forgive me, sir.

64
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,500
Sir!

65
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,166
-Later, then.
-No!

66
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,250
Lower.

67
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,041
Sir, namaste.

68
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,541
Mishra.

69
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,458
-How's everything?
-All good, sir.

70
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,416
Sir…

71
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,250
Sweets? What's the occasion?

72
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,416
Sir, with your blessings,

73
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,541
my son Raj just got a job
at a bank in London.

74
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,291
He'll earn 1.5 million a year.

75
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,291
-1.5 million.
-Yes, sir.

76
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,916
Isn't his name Raj Kumar?

77
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,625
It is. But ever since
he went to Mumbai for college,

78
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:37,333
he chucked the Kumar out of Raj Kumar.

79
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,208
What's wrong with "Raj Kumar"?

80
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,375
He thinks it doesn't suit his personality.

81
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,458
Whereas Raj sounds pretty cool.

82
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,708
So is this cool guy
coming to Bara Banki or…

83
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,666
He's on his way.
His friends have gone to pick him up.

84
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,458
-Ask him to come to the mansion.
-Okay, sir.

85
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,375
Hello.

86
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,875
Where the hell are you?

87
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,750
I'll show him how cool he is.

88
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,041
-Gopal, sir.
-Yes.

89
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,541
What do I have to do
to look as good as him?

90
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,125
Wait for another life.

91
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,125
-Sir.
-Babloo, sir.

92
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,125
-Hello.
-How are you, Raj?

93
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,166
-I'm good.
-Sir, it's Raj Kumar.

94
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,791
No. Just Raj is fine.

95
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,291
Suits him better.

96
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,083
Thanks.

97
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,541
Thanks to you, sir,
I now have a job in London.

98
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,500
What did I do?

99
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,166
You've kept my father
on your payroll for 30 years.

100
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,416
Even paid his hospital bills
when he broke his leg.

101
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,250
-I was the one who broke it.
-He made a mistake.

102
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,041
You have the right.

103
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,791
I've got a Rolex for you.

104
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,416
You didn't have to.

105
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,291
You've given so much to my family.

106
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,208
And I believe that
when you take something from someone,

107
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,208
you should always return the favor.

108
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,708
Won't you give me anything?

109
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,500
I'm Lipakshi. Babloo's wife.

110
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,875
Hello, ma'am.

111
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,708
Don't call me ma'am.

112
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,500
Not everyone needs to call me ma'am.

113
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,125
Sir's wife deserves respect
from everyone in this town,

114
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,166
state and the entire country.

115
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,208
You could have said that
while looking at me.

116
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,041
The only person
who's entitled to do that is Mr. Babloo.

117
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,541
That's exactly the issue.

118
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,666
He doesn't really know
what to do with that entitlement.

119
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,708
-Sir, I should go now.
-No.

120
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,041
Breakfast is already set.

121
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,875
Mishra, you can leave.
Raj will come later.

122
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,625
Sir, have a paratha. It's hot.

123
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,166
-Thank you.
-Some pickle?

124
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,041
Just get the damn pickle.
I've been asking for it since forever.

125
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,333
You'll go there and become
a slave to white people again.

126
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,916
Work for us. You're like family.

127
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,791
-My job there has already been confirmed.
-So?

128
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,416
Tell them you changed your mind.
Nobody's gonna shoot you.

129
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,208
-You're getting 1.5 million there, right?
-Yeah.

130
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,666
We'll…

131
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,166
give you 2.5.

132
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,625
Sir, it's not about the money.

133
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:48,166
You do know finance, right?
Or did you cheat to get your degree?

134
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,875
I topped at the university.

135
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,500
You'll be amazed to see
how I'll double your money.

136
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,583
Okay, it's final, then.

137
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,250
From this day on, you're mine.

138
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,333
Okay, sir.

139
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,583
From today, I'm yours.

140
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,000
Eat.

141
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,541
Do you work out?

142
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,500
Yes, ma'am.

143
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,958
Even we have a little gym
here in our mansion.

144
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,541
You can use it if you want to work out.

145
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,125
Thanks, ma'am, but I work out at home.

146
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,833
You could invite me over then.

147
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,458
Are you out of your mind?
Now you'll become Babloo's servant?

148
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,208
Like father, like son.

149
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,791
You were his servant
all your life. I'm just following you.

150
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,291
I did it because
I didn't have any other option.

151
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,083
Why'd I pay for your education?

152
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,791
I did it so you could get out
of this cesspool and take us with you.

153
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,208
You can leave. I'm staying here.

154
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:05,000
Do you see my limping leg?
This is all thanks to Babloo.

155
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,666
You crashed
his new Mercedes into a planter.

156
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,250
What else should he have done?

157
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,791
I can't believe this.
You're taking his side?

158
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,791
That's because
the real moolah lies on his side.

159
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,708
Instead of 1.5, I'll get 2.5.
Have you seen that much money?

160
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes, I have. Many times.

161
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,208
I've also seen how people get ruined
when they keep running after money.

162
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,541
-Bravo!
-Hey! Shut up.

163
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,500
I didn't force you to get married

164
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,125
so that I don't have to butt heads
with a daughter-in-law.

165
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,166
Let me watch my TV show in peace?

166
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,166
-Sorry, Mom.
-Get out of here.

167
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,833
Mishra, warm my dinner.

168
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,166
-I told you to get an expensive one.
-Here you go.

169
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,958
And where the hell were you?

170
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:45,958
Hey.

171
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,708
Yeah, right.

172
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,750
Here you snatch my cigarette,
and there you put a Rolex in Babloo's ass.

173
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,458
Your ass is too small
for a Rolex, isn't it?

174
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,250
Should I try a lollipop?

175
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,333
Shut up. Bloody freeloaders.

176
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,833
Vibhishan, the Rolex is fake.

177
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,666
Anyway, what's with that Lipakshi?

178
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,458
-You mean ma'am?
-Ma'am for you, not for me.

179
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,958
Give me the information.

180
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,583
She hails
from a political family in Hardoi.

181
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,166
Babloo's father funded
her father's political campaign,

182
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,416
helped him become an MLA.

183
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,750
Then forced her into marrying Babloo
and handed him a liquor license.

184
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,541
But one thing's for sure…

185
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,250
the marriage is totally on the rocks.

186
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,958
-And why's that?
-Children, of course.

187
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,041
It's been years since
they got married and still no child.

188
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,708
Does Babloo Junior manage
to give a standing ovation?

189
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,625
I don't know what Babloo Junior does,

190
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,458
but, yes, I do know
that Babloo Senior can screw your ass.

191
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,750
Stay away from her or you'll be screwed.

192
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,166
-Really?
-Really.

193
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:07,208
Collection network is set.
Every day they are counting.

194
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,291
The cash generated yearly is 100 million.

195
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,083
From land and liquor.

196
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:18,083
All this money is invested
in builders and property.

197
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,958
The yearly returns is at 15%.

198
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,583
Gopal has helped raise me.

199
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,083
He has handled all my business till now.

200
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:30,166
Sir, I have something to say.
Dealing in cash is now old school.

201
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,375
Returns are less,

202
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,791
and the government
is looting rich people for votes.

203
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,916
Now it's time to turn
all this black money into white.

204
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,500
Are you out of your mind?
Those income tax guys will come after us.

205
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,333
They won't.

206
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,708
Your money will be moved
through offshore accounts.

207
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,000
We'll invest in London
and New York stock exchanges.

208
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,000
We'll invest in hedge funds.
You know what hedge funds are?

209
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,666
Hedge funds. I know.

210
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,583
We'll get minimum 30% returns.
I'll get the paperwork started.

211
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,208
Good.

212
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,958
He speaks such fluent English.

213
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,500
That bugger
is fooling us with all his English.

214
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,958
I also know. Fuck.

215
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,791
What are hedge funds?
You never mentioned them.

216
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,000
Sir, I don't think this is a good idea.

217
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,000
When are you going to
stop pretending and look at me properly?

218
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,000
Hello, ma'am.

219
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,083
This naive act of yours,
keep it aside for Babloo.

220
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,583
He can be fooled, not me.

221
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,625
Why have you come here?

222
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,875
Why have you come here?

223
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,375
I wanted some water.

224
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,041
From my glass?

225
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,375
I'm not talking about the house.
I'm talking about my life.

226
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,875
-Why have you come into my life?
-It wasn't me.

227
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,833
I was supposed to go to London.
It was Mr. Babloo who stopped me.

228
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,208
And you let him do that so easily?

229
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,750
Wow.

230
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,625
Quite obedient you are.

231
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,416
Ma'am, please maintain distance.
Someone might see us.

232
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,166
Let them.

233
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,833
You are from a good family.

234
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,458
You are Mr. Babloo's wife.

235
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,291
This disgraceful behavior
doesn't suit you.

236
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,208
Quiet!

237
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,500
You're all the same.

238
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,125
Ever since you've arrived,
you keep staring at me.

239
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:15,041
You drink water from my glass,
and you talk about disgrace and stature?

240
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:19,500
You don't need to remind me
that I'm Babloo's wife.

241
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,625
The loneliness I feel
in this house is enough of a reminder.

242
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,458
I came to you looking for a companion,

243
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,916
but you're not even worthy
of being called a stranger.

244
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,791
Sir.

245
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,166
If you don't mind, can I say something?

246
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,250
You should leave ma'am.

247
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,166
She's not the right kind of woman.

248
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,916
If I could,
I would have done it a long time ago.

249
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,375
Her father is an MP.

250
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,708
If she goes, then I go down.

251
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:12,916
Ma'am.

252
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,000
Yes, Raj.

253
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,625
-Hi, sir.
-Hi.

254
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,791
I'm sorry
I've called so late in the night.

255
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,500
I have a fever.
I can't even manage to stand.

256
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,916
Can I take a leave tomorrow?

257
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,500
Yes, get some rest.

258
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,708
You have to travel to Lucknow.
I'll send Vibhishan.

259
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,500
I'll go on my own.

260
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,166
Okay, I'll tell Krishna.
He'll come to pick you up.

261
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,333
-Yes, okay. Take care.
-Okay.

262
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,583
Good night, sir. Thank you.

263
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:58,000
You bugger.
Why should I take him to Lucknow?

264
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,708
Because you look like a driver.

265
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,500
Your father's a driver,
dickhead. Not mine.

266
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,541
But you're the one
who looks like my father's son.

267
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,250
Did Auntie ever
pay our house a visit? Tell me.

268
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,000
Friend, companion, enemy…

269
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:28,333
Make me whatever you want me to be.
Just don't make me a stranger.

270
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,500
What if I raise an alarm?

271
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,125
Please go ahead.

272
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,625
Now that Babloo is away,
you've suddenly become Romeo?

273
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,583
The day you decide you're ready,

274
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,750
this Romeo
can even make you elope with him.

275
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,583
I don't trust evading eyes.

276
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,083
How dare you look into my eyes?

277
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,250
The whole country
should call me ma'am, right?

278
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,375
Am I not Mr. Babloo's wife?

279
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,375
I'm bad luck.

280
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,250
Whoever comes close to me dies.

281
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,666
Death is fine for me.

282
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,250
One, two. Yes.

283
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,000
One, Two. Jump.

284
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,166
-Sir.
-One, two.

285
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,541
Sir?

286
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,458
-Sir, you've become quite lazy.
-What the…

287
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,208
Sorry, sir.

288
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:56,583
-I'll show you how lazy I am.
-Sorry, sir, I made a mistake.

289
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,750
I made a mistake.

290
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,416
You're such a bitch.

291
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:28,333
You were making me jealous
back there with Babloo.

292
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:31,291
If I'm a bitch, then you're a bastard.

293
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,708
Will you run away with me?

294
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,916
After I got married to Babloo…

295
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,791
I had lost all hope from life.

296
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,541
And then you came into my life.

297
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,791
Now it feels like
I also have the right to be happy.

298
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,041
To start a new family.

299
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,041
To be able to live again.

300
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:29,958
Do you love me?

301
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,083
You do, right?

302
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:39,958
Yeah.

303
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,041
I love you, Raj.

304
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,750
I've booked two tickets
for the day after tomorrow.

305
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:52,625
Reach the railway station by 4:00.

306
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:14,541
-This mail arrived today for you.
-Here, keep this inside.

307
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:15,458
Okay, sir.

308
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,666
-Done?
-Yes.

309
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,041
Raj, you'll come with us.

310
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,958
But, sir, I have to drop off
my parents at the bus station.

311
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:57,083
-Drop them and come to the farm.
-I'll bring him there.

312
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:02,458
-Raj, come alone.
-Okay, sir.

313
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:14,208
Okay, you go.

314
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:16,458
-Take care of Mom.
-Go, you go.

315
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:40,250
Sir.

316
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,083
Don't call me that.

317
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:44,166
I'm not your sir.

318
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:47,000
Why do you say that?

319
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,458
-You'll always be that.
-Because I don't want that.

320
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:51,833
I want something else from you.

321
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:05,791
Sorry. It's just that…

322
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,333
I've fallen in love with you.

323
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:13,458
I didn't think this would happen…

324
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:16,458
but it did.

325
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,458
I love you, Raj.

326
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,291
-Sir--
-Don't call me that.

327
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:28,458
Okay.

328
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:31,083
Babloo.

329
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,041
Can you say that one more time?

330
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,916
Babloo.

331
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:54,375
He…

332
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,875
He called me by my name, too.

333
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:02,333
"Aye, Babloo."

334
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,458
Ashish Pandey.

335
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:09,833
We were in love with each other.

336
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,458
We were planning
to run away from Bara Banki.

337
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,291
Somehow my father came to know…

338
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:22,333
And that very night…

339
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,250
Ashish and his entire family were gone.

340
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:34,583
I don't even know if he's alive.

341
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:42,125
And then my father,

342
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:46,208
in order to save his honor,
forced me to get married.

343
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:49,125
I could never love Lipakshi.

344
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,458
Even though it wasn't her fault.

345
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:56,833
I never gave my father the satisfaction
of being a grandfather till the end.

346
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:06,958
Can you do me a favor?

347
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:30,375
After marrying Lipakshi,
I was never attracted to anyone.

348
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:32,416
Never expressed my feelings.

349
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:38,458
I let her off the hook for every mistake
she made. But… not for this one.

350
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,166
Raj, kill Lipakshi.

351
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,541
If her father wasn't a powerful man…

352
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:46,625
But I won't let anything happen to you.

353
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,291
I'll be with you forever.

354
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:56,625
Will you do it?

355
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:08,958
I've been alone
for a long time, Raj. Very alone.

356
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:26,666
I found out that Gopal and ma'am
are planning to run away together.

357
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:30,750
You take care of Gopal.
I'll kill ma'am at the station.

358
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,833
Be careful.

359
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:42,000
Just make sure nothing happens to you.

360
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:46,083
I'll be fine.

361
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:58,583
So what do you expect from me, then?

362
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,708
To uphold
our families' reputation, that's all.

363
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:29,250
You were always like my son!
How could I have done this?

364
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,708
That is why!

365
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:55,583
Babloo, sir.

366
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:59,458
Gopal is innocent. Let him go.

367
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:02,416
Now that you've seen the video.

368
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:06,041
You broke my father's leg for no reason.

369
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,166
-Which of your feet slipped, Mr. Mishra?
-I'm sorry, sir.

370
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,583
Babloo, sir! Sir, please!

371
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:19,916
That was the day I took an oath
that one day I'll take my revenge.

372
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:35,333
Out of your colossal wealth,
I've siphoned off only five million.

373
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,291
Which you and Gopal
will never be able to trace.

374
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:45,958
By the time you watch this video,

375
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:49,166
me and my family
will have left this country.

376
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,708
Lipakshi and you
have given me a lot of love.

377
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:57,791
I'll always be grateful for that.

378
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:08,666
I once told you…

379
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:12,000
use your hands to kill me.

380
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,333
I don't trust your gun.

381
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,750
I'm pregnant.

382
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,666
I had told you

383
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:12,125
when I take something
from someone, I always return the favor.

384
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:16,791
Yours lovingly, Raj Kumar Mishra.

385
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:32,875
TOY

386
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:22,666
What's your name?

387
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:24,666
Binny.

388
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,625
-Can you speak louder?
-Binny.

389
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:31,000
Binny.

390
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:32,541
Which school do you go to?

391
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:36,208
Rani Lakshmi Bai Inter College.

392
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:39,000
You study in an inter college?

393
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,875
No.

394
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:41,791
Why not?

395
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:43,958
Why don't you study
in an intermediate college?

396
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,333
I'm too young, that's why. Fourth grade.

397
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:49,625
You don't seem that young.

398
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:56,500
Hey. Go away.

399
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,125
Sister will be here soon.

400
00:35:58,208 --> 00:35:59,791
No, she won't.

401
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:02,958
Neighborhood people have
told her not to hang around here.

402
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,041
You get lost, too.

403
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:07,041
They also told you not to set up
your stall here, didn't they?

404
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,708
Hey! You've got a sharp tongue.

405
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:11,458
And there's leakage in you shop.

406
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:13,375
Leakage? What do you mean?

407
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:16,208
Water leakage.

408
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,875
I'll burn you sisters someday!

409
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:25,041
I've heard that you're quite mischievous.

410
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:26,583
No, I'm not.

411
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:28,708
Come on, you're bluffing.

412
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:30,583
Be honest.

413
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,666
Okay, maybe sometimes.

414
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:36,291
So what kind of mischief do you get into?

415
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:40,708
I sometimes pour water into Sushil's iron.

416
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:41,708
Really?

417
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,541
Then he must be quite angry at you, right?

418
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,708
He says he'll burn us.

419
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,375
Where's my sister?

420
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:07,458
How come you're panting so much?

421
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:09,958
I just poured water into Sushil's iron.

422
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,458
What did he say then?

423
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:13,125
He said he'll burn us.

424
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:15,166
He said that?

425
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:17,833
Burn us?

426
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:19,375
Meenal?

427
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:24,125
Shoes outside!

428
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:28,375
How many times have I told you
to leave your shoes outside!

429
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,458
-Why don't you get it?
-That's enough.

430
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:32,208
Look at this! She never listens to me!

431
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,875
I just cleaned it and she stained it!

432
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:35,458
-How hard the child is hit.
-Go on.

433
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:37,958
Get the clothes from the terrace. Go!

434
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:50,416
You hit me too hard today.

435
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:54,708
-You want her to give you food?
-Will she?

436
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:57,416
After seeing you
get that beating? She sure will.

437
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:05,750
-What's for lunch today?
-Eggplant.

438
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:07,916
They eat eggplant every other day.

439
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,916
That's why they're not able to have kids.

440
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:12,208
If they do, it'll look like an eggplant.

441
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:23,333
Fold them.

442
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:30,125
I've kept aside
some food for you, child. Go eat.

443
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,500
Ma'am, you shouldn't give her food.

444
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:34,541
She'll finish all of your eggplant.

445
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:39,250
Look at this cute, innocent child.
How could you hit her like that?

446
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,666
It didn't hurt too bad, did it?

447
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:45,541
-Ma'am?
-Yes?

448
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:47,958
We don't have electricity anymore.

449
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:50,708
The neighborhood people
have cut off our illegal power connection.

450
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:54,125
There's nothing
but darkness in our lives now.

451
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,375
She can't read, she can't sleep.

452
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:00,666
Would you please talk
to the neighborhood people about this?

453
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,500
Vinod Agarwal is
the neighborhood's new secretary.

454
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:05,458
You should talk to him.

455
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:07,875
Which Vinod Agarwal?

456
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:11,708
B-16. His wife is pregnant.

457
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:14,291
I've been knitting this sweater
for their expected baby.

458
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:18,500
He's the one who wears dark glasses
and rides a motorcycle. Talk to him.

459
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,833
If he agrees, he can get
your power working.

460
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:23,125
Okay.

461
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:26,583
Isn't that so? Take it.

462
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,583
-Sister, I swear on Binny.
-Stop calling me sister.

463
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,500
Sorry.

464
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:38,500
Ma'am, we're poor people.

465
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,500
-So are many people in this country.
-Please--

466
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:43,291
-Stop it!
-Sorry, ma'am.

467
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:46,458
Our father left us after Binny was born.

468
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:47,708
Our mother died.

469
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:51,000
We were left all by ourselves.

470
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:54,291
I somehow manage to earn enough to send
her to school. I've not done anything.

471
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:57,083
Meenal, if our senior officer
sees you crying like this,

472
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:59,208
then he'll surely think you're a criminal.

473
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,125
Stop crying. Give straight answers.

474
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:02,875
Manju.

475
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:12,500
Did she say anything?

476
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:23,833
What's going on between Sushil and you?

477
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,833
What luck!

478
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,083
Yeah, whatever.

479
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:40,708
What luck!

480
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,541
You're such a bitch!

481
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:46,041
-Hey!
-Bitch!

482
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,958
You're calling me a bitch?
I'll bite you then.

483
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:50,750
Should I bite you? Should I?

484
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:55,833
I'm here.

485
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:04,083
-Did you bring coal?
-Coal?

486
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,333
You didn't ask me to get coal.

487
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:09,708
You forgot?

488
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:12,416
To burn us.

489
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:23,666
They'll take away my stall.

490
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,666
If you love your stall so much,
stay there. Why come here?

491
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:29,208
My hands are aching.

492
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:32,250
So are mine, after washing
all those kitchen utensils.

493
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:34,333
And so are mine,
after doing all that homework.

494
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:36,375
Don't worry.

495
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:39,958
-I'll massage your hands.
-No need for all this.

496
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:42,208
If us coming to your stall
bothers you so much,

497
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:43,666
then you shouldn't be here either.

498
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:48,041
That motherfucker Agarwal
tells me that I fool around with women.

499
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:50,625
-Who's Agarwal?
-Vinod Agarwal.

500
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:53,333
He's the new secretary.

501
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:55,916
I told him I don't fool around with women,

502
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:59,000
but he said
I shouldn't even joke around with them

503
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:01,041
as it doesn't look good
for the neighborhood.

504
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,875
He cursed at me so much.

505
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:05,375
He's threatening to
close down my stall. What will I do?

506
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,250
What do I do?

507
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:10,708
It's okay. Calm down. Relax.

508
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:12,625
Calm down.

509
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:15,000
Can I mess up your hair?

510
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:16,250
Yes, you can.

511
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:19,208
You're overdoing it.

512
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:22,416
You're orphans, but you're teaching
your sister to fool around with men?

513
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:24,791
Screwing around with that laundry guy?

514
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:26,291
No, ma'am.

515
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:28,333
I go to his stall
to deliver people's clothes.

516
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:30,083
What time did he leave Agarwal's house?

517
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:34,000
-When?
-The day of the incident.

518
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:37,416
-What time did he leave Agarwal's house?
-I don't remember, sister.

519
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:48,125
You both sought pleasures of the flesh.
Now you'll get your flesh ripped.

520
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,958
-Sister…
-Move!

521
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:52,666
Move. Straight ahead.

522
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,541
When did you
start working at Agarwal's house?

523
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:58,166
How many times have I told you
not to come here?

524
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,666
You should get away from here.

525
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,125
I'm not leaving without meeting Agarwal.

526
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:10,125
He has said multiple times
that you shouldn't hee-haw over here.

527
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:12,333
-Am I doing that?
-What does "hee-haw" mean?

528
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,750
This. It means this.

529
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,083
See? There's your hee-haw.

530
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:17,916
He always has his eyes on me.

531
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:21,041
Not on you. He always has his eyes on me.

532
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,791
Utter nonsense you speak.

533
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:27,416
Hey, you done with the clothes?

534
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,333
No, sir, they'll be done in an hour.

535
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,791
You should be focusing
on your trade and not the maid.

536
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:34,958
Congratulations.

537
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:39,000
-What for?
-You're going to be a father, right?

538
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,291
Congratulations.

539
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,833
Abha didi told me.

540
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:50,250
She's knitting
a blue sweater for your baby.

541
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:52,125
Wasn't that supposed to be a surprise?

542
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:54,000
You ruined it.

543
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:57,166
Surprise, in English, means unexpected.

544
00:44:57,791 --> 00:44:58,833
You get what I mean?

545
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:04,000
Like you're crossing a road and suddenly
a truck comes at you unexpectedly.

546
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:07,000
-Then you get a surprise.
-Yes, you got it.

547
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:10,666
But how exactly
did I ruin a surprise for you?

548
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,541
You just told me
about the blue sweater, didn't you?

549
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:17,916
Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

550
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,333
What did she say?

551
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:22,583
She studies in a government school.

552
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:24,416
Becoming more of a rascal lately.

553
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,125
I want to put her in a better school.

554
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:30,250
Been looking for more work
so I can do that.

555
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:35,833
Come to my house tomorrow morning.

556
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:37,916
I'll introduce you to my wife.

557
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:40,000
Okay.

558
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:44,541
Focus.

559
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:19,541
I had to cough.

560
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,166
Yes. Let's call it a day.

561
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:38,208
This neighborhood
is filled with such idiots.

562
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:46,208
A woman who can't bear children

563
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:48,875
is knitting sweater
for someone else's baby.

564
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:51,041
And someone who's having a baby

565
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:53,500
is more excited
for a surprise sweater than the baby.

566
00:46:56,791 --> 00:47:00,791
These people give you clothes,
fruit and food to eat.

567
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:04,083
You're talking shit about them.

568
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:11,750
That huge gate and the guard outside it,
who are they meant to stop?

569
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:14,458
People like us.

570
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,333
So we can't ever get into their palaces.

571
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:23,041
Those people living
in mansions can never be our friends.

572
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,000
Sons of bitches shut off our power.

573
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,500
Let it go. It doesn't matter. Happens.

574
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:35,375
Why doesn't it matter?

575
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,166
She had gotten used to
falling asleep watching TV.

576
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,875
Used to leave the TV on
when she went to sleep.

577
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:45,958
Colorful lights falling on her eyes from
the TV used to give her colorful dreams.

578
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:52,458
Those people won't let you reconnect
your illegal connection.

579
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,708
If Vinod Agarwal decides to,
he can make it happen.

580
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,000
He won't do anything fishy.
He has a wife at home.

581
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,625
I'll do all the cleaning
in two, three hours and get out.

582
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:17,958
Let him stare at me if he wants to.

583
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:20,791
If he tries anything more than that,

584
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:23,791
I'll print a hot iron on his face.

585
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:32,958
You're not any less of a fool.

586
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:37,208
If that ain't the truth.

587
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:46,416
Meenal, cut these vegetables.

588
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,875
Okay, ma'am.

589
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:50,166
Meenal, what are you doing?

590
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,833
Ma'am, actually we don't have electricity.

591
00:49:53,416 --> 00:49:57,083
The neighborhood people disconnected
our power. Could you have a word with sir?

592
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,375
I will.

593
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,666
Come on, tell me everything you know.

594
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,583
What, sir?

595
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:01,750
Everything that happened
at his house. Quick, there's no time.

596
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:04,833
-Sir, how would I know that?
-Why?

597
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,416
Meenal didn't tell you anything?

598
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:33,666
As of now, it's only
Sushil's screams that you can hear.

599
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:38,333
Start talking or else
you'll soon hear Binny scream, too.

600
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:42,458
I haven't done anything.

601
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:45,250
You should question that bitch Abha.

602
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:48,000
She's infertile.
She must have been jealous.

603
00:51:48,958 --> 00:51:50,666
I haven't done anything at all.

604
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:57,083
-It's really beautiful.
-You can use it later.

605
00:51:57,166 --> 00:51:58,291
Offer her first.

606
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:04,875
You left our house to work over here.

607
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,625
It's because she's pregnant.

608
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:11,000
Needed more attention.

609
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:15,083
When you get pregnant,
I'll work for you again.

610
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:26,291
My darling, my golden boy.

611
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:29,541
Let me give you a massage.

612
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:32,458
Oil.

613
00:52:33,291 --> 00:52:36,166
Oil massage, oil massage.

614
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,750
Oh, my darling son.

615
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:41,500
Such a beautiful baby.

616
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:44,791
Little Agarwal.

617
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,041
Such a pretty little baby.

618
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,125
When I go to sleep,

619
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:01,000
what exactly do you and Sushil do?

620
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,416
Nothing.

621
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:07,041
Hey. That's a lie.

622
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:11,000
How do you know
what's true and what's not?

623
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:15,875
-You're asleep by then, aren't you?
-How can I sleep without the TV on?

624
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:23,333
Do you want to have a baby, too?

625
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:30,416
I'll whack you so hard,
you'll see colorful lights without the TV.

626
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,125
-Now sleep.
-Why?

627
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:36,083
Weren't you crying
all those tears watching that baby?

628
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,541
What baby?

629
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:41,750
They make me clean all that shit and piss,

630
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:45,125
and the only reason they
even hold their baby is to play with it.

631
00:53:45,208 --> 00:53:48,416
It's not their baby,
it's just a toy for them.

632
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:54,333
Yes.

633
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:56,333
We're all prepared for the function.

634
00:53:56,916 --> 00:53:58,041
Stop worrying.

635
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:00,333
Don't go on shopping
for too long, it'll tire you.

636
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:03,500
Yes. I'm with the baby.

637
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:04,666
Come home soon.

638
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:17,625
Listen.

639
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:24,333
You need electricity?

640
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:28,416
-Yes.
-I'll get it done.

641
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:30,916
No need to worry.

642
00:54:31,666 --> 00:54:32,750
Thank you.

643
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:38,166
You'll dry all these clothes by yourself?

644
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:40,583
Let me help you with that.

645
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,458
You should be with the baby.

646
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:47,875
-It's okay, let me help.
-No, I'll do it.

647
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:55,500
Binny, keep playing
with the baby. Shake that. Yes.

648
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,041
Take care of the baby, okay?

649
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:08,708
There.

650
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:11,166
You got hurt.

651
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,916
You want the electricity or not?

652
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:32,083
You want it, right?

653
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,375
Meenal, what happened?

654
00:55:57,458 --> 00:55:59,500
Will you please tell me what happened?

655
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,791
Sushil, you motherfucker.

656
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:14,416
I've told you not to
let people loiter around over here.

657
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,791
Don't you get it?

658
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:18,500
What are you staring at?

659
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,291
What are you staring at, you bastard?

660
00:56:21,666 --> 00:56:27,208
We let you put up your stall here,
and you create a nuisance for us.

661
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:32,500
Fucking imbecile!

662
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:33,833
Take this.

663
00:56:33,916 --> 00:56:36,000
I'll teach you a lesson today.

664
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,208
Fucker!

665
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:43,458
Mr. Agarwal, stop it.

666
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:46,291
What are you doing? Stop it, Mr. Agarwal.

667
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:47,875
What are you doing, Mr. Agarwal?

668
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:50,166
Let me go.

669
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:55,291
Look at that little girl, she's seven.

670
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,500
She has no idea
what this man's intentions are, does she?

671
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:06,541
Are you okay, child?

672
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:08,916
We're having the function tonight.

673
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:10,666
Come over.

674
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,750
Help my wife with things.

675
00:57:13,916 --> 00:57:14,958
You come, too.

676
00:57:15,541 --> 00:57:16,375
Okay?

677
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:22,708
Come here.

678
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:25,875
Now look…

679
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,416
when I tell you something,
you better listen.

680
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,958
I say everything for a reason. Get it?

681
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:34,375
Come over in the evening.

682
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:36,583
Have some snacks.

683
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:41,208
Go on now.

684
00:58:04,708 --> 00:58:06,250
Can we play a game?

685
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:18,208
It's working!

686
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:27,000
What's this?

687
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:31,375
Haven't you seen me cry before?

688
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:36,541
"Such a beautiful baby.
What a pretty baby."

689
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:38,750
"Little Agarwal baby."

690
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:39,916
"My baby."

691
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:42,583
These tears aren't like those ones?

692
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:48,375
And what are those ones like?

693
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:51,416
Bitch tears!

694
01:00:03,083 --> 01:00:04,208
Motherfucker!

695
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:09,041
Son of a bitch.
So you don't know anything?

696
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:12,291
Nothing at all?

697
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:14,875
I have done nothing, sir.

698
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,416
All I did was blow up the transformer.

699
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,375
I'll make you feel sorry, you fucker.

700
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:26,666
Vinod Agarwal groped Meenal, sir!

701
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,625
That motherfucker groped Meenal!

702
01:00:52,041 --> 01:00:55,083
No. What the hell?

703
01:00:55,166 --> 01:00:58,666
Here we're celebrating the light
of our lives, and it just went dark.

704
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:00,750
He talks without thinking.

705
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:03,333
-Where's our light, our Chirag?
-Right here.

706
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:04,583
Check if he's okay.

707
01:01:06,666 --> 01:01:08,291
-He's not here.
-What do you mean?

708
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:11,875
Abha?

709
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,458
Where is he?

710
01:01:13,541 --> 01:01:15,291
Where's our son? Does somebody have him?

711
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:16,666
He was here only…

712
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,541
-Get me a flashlight.
-Did you see him?

713
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:20,875
Sunita mausi, is he with you?

714
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:22,750
Do any of you have him with you?

715
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:24,333
Munna, munna.

716
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,333
Where's my son? Where is he? Move aside.

717
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,666
Vinod Agarwal had groped Meenal
on the same day.

718
01:02:47,916 --> 01:02:50,208
Both of them think
of the other as their toy.

719
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:51,750
Both of whom?

720
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:56,791
The rich, and then these ones.

721
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:59,458
The ones who steal electricity.

722
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:03,625
HAZRATGANJ POLICE STATION
LUCKNOW

723
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:04,541
She's here.

724
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:05,458
Please come.

725
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:11,833
Please come.

726
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:14,750
That's her! She's the one!

727
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,083
It's because of her
that we're getting accused!

728
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:20,000
She's the one who killed that baby!
She's barren! Bloody bitch!

729
01:03:20,083 --> 01:03:21,458
I know you did it!

730
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:23,958
Shut your mouth!

731
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:11,125
Show me your bag, child.

732
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:14,041
Your bag.

733
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:36,333
You took this from the baby.

734
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,333
It wasn't their baby.

735
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:43,791
It was just their toy.

736
01:04:54,875 --> 01:05:00,875
SLOPPY KISSES

737
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:35,416
Bhupesh!

738
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,041
The manager is here! Get to work!

739
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:38,833
But who's that madam over there?

740
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:52,666
Bharti.

741
01:05:54,541 --> 01:05:55,375
Learn from her.

742
01:05:57,583 --> 01:05:59,666
She's the one
they were talking about yesterday.

743
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,250
There goes your dream job.

744
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:34,083
Sir.

745
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:40,125
Sir, you said
the data operator job wasn't available.

746
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:42,625
Then why did you hire that girl?

747
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:45,041
I have the same degree.

748
01:06:45,125 --> 01:06:46,833
I gave the right answers in my interview.

749
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:49,208
Sure. You gave the right answers.

750
01:06:49,958 --> 01:06:52,916
You're qualified, too. There are
many factors when it comes to hiring.

751
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,416
Sir, I got 74% in B. Com.

752
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,291
I'm very good at accounting, too, sir.

753
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:02,625
Can you work on Tally?

754
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:05,000
And Excel?

755
01:07:06,333 --> 01:07:08,291
I can learn it in a week, sir.

756
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:13,583
Bharti, is there a better machine-man
than you on the entire floor?

757
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:18,583
You know what separates
you from these men?

758
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:22,500
They're all workers.
And you're a craftsman.

759
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:25,166
Don't get wrapped up in all this.

760
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,791
Soon you'll be promoted
to a shift supervisor.

761
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:29,833
So I can't get the data operator job?

762
01:07:33,208 --> 01:07:34,916
It's time for my morning prayer.

763
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,333
We'll talk about this later. Now get out.

764
01:07:42,916 --> 01:07:45,000
How long does it take
to learn Excel and Tally?

765
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:47,250
Three days? Four days?

766
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:49,333
A week at most?

767
01:07:49,416 --> 01:07:52,458
Even if you learn all that,
you won't get the job.

768
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:55,291
What do you mean?

769
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:00,166
Why can't I get the job?

770
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:07,625
Say something.

771
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:10,541
Is it because I don't
wear makeup like her?

772
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:13,666
-I have a degree, too, you know.
-Because you're Bharti Mandal.

773
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:18,375
Do you have a privileged-caste surname
like Banerjee or Sharma?

774
01:08:18,458 --> 01:08:19,625
We are Dalits.

775
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:22,125
Did you forget that for a moment?

776
01:08:24,083 --> 01:08:25,958
They'll allow us to eat at a table,

777
01:08:26,958 --> 01:08:29,041
but they won't let us work at one.

778
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:34,333
Don't fight for what can't be yours
or they'll burn you up in flames.

779
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,875
To hell with your fear, Dashrath.

780
01:08:57,791 --> 01:08:59,833
Please come, madam. This is the canteen.

781
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:16,666
Hello. Priya Sharma.

782
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:24,041
It's my first day at work.

783
01:09:34,958 --> 01:09:36,625
Would you like some stuffed okra?

784
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:52,666
Where do you go when you have to pee?

785
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:56,083
Where everyone goes.

786
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,375
But how can women go there?

787
01:09:58,458 --> 01:09:59,833
Do you see any women here?

788
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:04,500
You?

789
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:14,708
Sit down.

790
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,625
Miss Priya, you coming
down here feels like…

791
01:10:26,166 --> 01:10:28,250
a goddess has descended upon us.

792
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:31,583
Look, India has progressed so much,

793
01:10:31,666 --> 01:10:34,375
and yet there isn't
a single woman in this factory.

794
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,708
Don't look at her.

795
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:41,458
If you stare too long,

796
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:45,666
you'll see a beard sprouting on her face.

797
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:47,958
Get back, Bhupesh.

798
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:51,750
She works her hands on machines all day.

799
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:54,416
She only has her hands to satisfy herself.

800
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,250
Motherfucker.

801
01:10:59,041 --> 01:11:01,166
Have you gone mad?
How can you hit her like that?

802
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,458
She threw water at me!

803
01:11:03,541 --> 01:11:05,708
-And you…
-Stop it. Don't you have manners?

804
01:11:07,208 --> 01:11:09,291
-Bharti.
-Ma'am, stop.

805
01:11:13,625 --> 01:11:15,291
No, no, no.

806
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:17,958
You had it coming.

807
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:19,125
Take her away.

808
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:20,708
Behaving like such a creep,

809
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:22,875
I'd say he deserves a few more slaps.

810
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:24,708
I had warned him many times.

811
01:11:29,541 --> 01:11:30,375
Are you okay?

812
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:33,375
-Yes, sir.
-Who started the fight?

813
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:39,458
Sir, that long-haired man was being--

814
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:40,791
Sir, it's just…

815
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:42,583
Let it be.

816
01:11:43,458 --> 01:11:44,791
Why do you do this?

817
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:46,958
It happens in every few months.

818
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:51,000
If you had hurt your hands,
who'd pay for the idle machines?

819
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:52,666
Tell me.

820
01:11:54,583 --> 01:11:55,666
Be careful.

821
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,458
Why didn't you say anything?

822
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,500
You are Kavita.

823
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:08,625
What?

824
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:10,541
Kavita was my childhood friend.

825
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:14,041
We were in high school
and the Holi festival was on.

826
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:18,958
As she was about to sit,
I kept a red water balloon on her seat.

827
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:22,458
Her white skirt and panties
turned totally red.

828
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:25,208
She was screaming in horror.

829
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:26,416
Poor thing.

830
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:32,416
But she didn't complain, just like you.

831
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:36,833
She spent all day with a sweater
tied around her waist. Stupid girl.

832
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:42,958
Your name's Bharti, right?

833
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:45,916
Bharti…

834
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:48,666
Banerjee.

835
01:12:55,416 --> 01:12:57,125
You have beautiful eyes.

836
01:13:04,041 --> 01:13:05,541
I should leave now.

837
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:08,791
Yeah, I need to finish
my joining formalities, too.

838
01:13:10,666 --> 01:13:11,708
I'll see you later.

839
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:21,541
Murli.

840
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:23,541
What are you eating?

841
01:13:23,625 --> 01:13:25,875
Come on. I'll feed you.

842
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:30,416
Come here.

843
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:36,875
What happened?

844
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:39,875
So you pooped outside
Auntie Dwivedi's house again?

845
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:41,583
Why?

846
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:45,416
Why did you do it?
Tell me. Don't you understand?

847
01:13:45,958 --> 01:13:48,125
Haven't I told you 100 times not to do it?

848
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:49,583
All you want is food.

849
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:52,125
No, you're not getting any.

850
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:57,500
-Not on video. Witch.
-Why?

851
01:13:57,583 --> 01:13:59,041
All the boys do it.

852
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:01,000
So you know what stuff boys do?

853
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:02,583
I do. Can I show you?

854
01:14:03,166 --> 01:14:04,541
-Can I?
-Show me.

855
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:13,250
Witch. Not on video.

856
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,791
What shall I do?

857
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:19,208
Pack you in a suitcase
and take you to Delhi with me?

858
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:03,500
Are you asleep?

859
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:06,000
Please come.

860
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:28,125
Miss Bharti.

861
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,375
Do you always walk home?

862
01:15:32,583 --> 01:15:34,916
-Yes.
-I live nearby, too.

863
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,208
About ten minutes by rickshaw,
and fifteen minutes walking.

864
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:43,041
But the Sharmas' daughter-in-law
can't be seen walking on streets.

865
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:46,750
Can I drop you home?

866
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:50,333
Well, I'm not a Sharma daughter-in-law.

867
01:15:50,416 --> 01:15:53,958
Don't worry. I won't cling on to you.

868
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:58,416
I won't ask everyday.
Just for today. Come on.

869
01:16:01,916 --> 01:16:04,083
Is it some special occasion?

870
01:16:04,166 --> 01:16:06,750
I'm really craving some dahi vada today.

871
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:08,666
Come on.

872
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:13,041
Don't put ginger powder in hers.
And make mine really spicy.

873
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:20,875
Thank you.

874
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:23,291
That's for you.

875
01:16:25,041 --> 01:16:28,000
So you were telling me,
who are your friends?

876
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:30,041
Friends?

877
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:34,625
-Dashrath.
-Not like him.

878
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:38,458
I mean… your best friend.

879
01:16:40,708 --> 01:16:44,291
Like Kavita, whose skirt
and panties you turned red?

880
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:48,166
OMG! Such dirty talk in public?

881
01:16:52,666 --> 01:16:57,541
You know, Kavita and I loved
riding around on my scooter in college.

882
01:16:57,625 --> 01:17:00,500
Once during our exams,
we were up studying all night.

883
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:04,375
So in the morning I said,
"Let's go for a ride."

884
01:17:06,333 --> 01:17:07,958
She sat behind me

885
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:10,583
and fell asleep
like a baby on my shoulder.

886
01:17:11,541 --> 01:17:13,750
I didn't have the heart to wake her up,

887
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:16,500
so I rode the scooter around
for an hour and a half

888
01:17:16,583 --> 01:17:18,375
just so she could
remain blissfully asleep.

889
01:17:18,958 --> 01:17:21,125
And then, it ran out of petrol.

890
01:17:22,333 --> 01:17:25,375
We dragged the scooter
around for four kilometers.

891
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:28,458
And instead of being grateful,
she shouted at me.

892
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:29,958
Witch.

893
01:17:32,625 --> 01:17:34,041
You call her a witch?

894
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,666
That's what I used to call her.

895
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:38,833
Not anymore.

896
01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:42,375
Now she doesn't even take my calls.

897
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:44,583
She got married and flew away.

898
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:48,583
I guess someone else
gets to call her a witch now.

899
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:56,291
-Didn't you try to contact her again?
-I did.

900
01:17:56,791 --> 01:17:59,166
I even went to her office to surprise her.

901
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:01,625
She got mad at me.

902
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:04,291
She said, "Grow up,
we're not in college anymore."

903
01:18:05,041 --> 01:18:06,625
She said, "You're married,

904
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:09,500
and you still want to frolic
on a scooter with pompoms."

905
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,583
I talk too much, don't I?

906
01:18:18,666 --> 01:18:21,750
You must think
I'm always telling these Tangy Tales.

907
01:18:22,416 --> 01:18:23,666
"Tangy Tales"?

908
01:18:24,958 --> 01:18:26,916
Haven't you read that magazine?

909
01:18:28,125 --> 01:18:30,625
It has such fun, pulpy stories.

910
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:32,375
Really.

911
01:18:33,541 --> 01:18:35,041
So is that how you got the job?

912
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:37,375
By telling them Tangy Tales
during your interview?

913
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:41,416
Believe it or not,
it was something like that.

914
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:45,041
The manager asked me what my hobbies were.

915
01:18:45,666 --> 01:18:48,666
I told him I do palm-reading.

916
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:49,583
That's it.

917
01:18:49,666 --> 01:18:52,333
You learn that much in a Brahmin house.

918
01:18:52,416 --> 01:18:56,208
I looked at his palm
and just rattled off a few things.

919
01:18:56,291 --> 01:18:59,000
Astrology, fortune-telling, blah-blah…

920
01:18:59,666 --> 01:19:01,333
And I got a call the next day.

921
01:19:01,416 --> 01:19:03,625
They didn't ask you
if you can work on Excel and Tally?

922
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:06,041
No. Sir said that Mr. Alok
will teach me everything.

923
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:08,833
Everyone's so helpful.

924
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:13,166
Anyway, I've managed to learn
quite a bit in the last few days.

925
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:20,000
Did I say something wrong?

926
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:22,166
Nothing. It's just…

927
01:19:22,833 --> 01:19:25,083
I miss my mom suddenly.

928
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:28,333
I can understand.

929
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:52,166
Look.

930
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:56,208
Neither is Dashrath your best friend…

931
01:19:57,625 --> 01:19:59,500
nor is Kavita my friend anymore.

932
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:03,791
From today onwards, we'll be friends.

933
01:20:05,291 --> 01:20:06,125
Okay?

934
01:20:10,125 --> 01:20:12,625
I made pulao today. Ma taught me.

935
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:15,916
I think I overdid the cardamom. Try some?

936
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,750
-No.
-Come on. Just one bite.

937
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:28,208
Just want to say

938
01:20:29,708 --> 01:20:33,875
Stay with me, always

939
01:20:35,583 --> 01:20:39,333
Your hands, these nights
Our little secrets

940
01:20:39,416 --> 01:20:44,416
Snuck in a corner

941
01:20:45,666 --> 01:20:49,916
Tucked under my pillow

942
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:54,333
Like a magic potion

943
01:20:54,958 --> 01:20:59,625
Stay with me

944
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:09,208
Wherever I go

945
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:15,291
I pass through you

946
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:19,875
To find myself

947
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:29,000
Just want to say

948
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:33,958
Stay with me, always

949
01:21:34,041 --> 01:21:40,041
Forever, stay

950
01:21:54,125 --> 01:21:55,125
Priya.

951
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,541
-Sorry, I'm really late.
-Not at all.

952
01:21:57,625 --> 01:21:59,375
And I forgot to get the box of sweets.

953
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:01,375
Never mind. Come in.

954
01:22:06,958 --> 01:22:08,958
-It smells delicious.
-Right?

955
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:10,875
Totally.

956
01:22:11,666 --> 01:22:14,375
You know,
I haven't had chicken since I got married.

957
01:22:14,958 --> 01:22:17,541
If my in-laws find out,
they'll be in shock.

958
01:22:17,625 --> 01:22:19,625
-A Sharma girl eating meat--
-Stop talking.

959
01:22:19,708 --> 01:22:21,041
Tell me how it tastes.

960
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:25,500
Salt?

961
01:22:26,166 --> 01:22:28,000
-It's perfect.
-Is it salty enough?

962
01:22:28,791 --> 01:22:30,583
You have magic in your hands.

963
01:22:30,666 --> 01:22:32,125
-Give me your hands.
-Why?

964
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:35,333
I thought you were going to read my palm.

965
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:37,041
Sorry.

966
01:22:37,125 --> 01:22:38,666
I gave you sloppy kisses.

967
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:42,375
What? Do you want sloppy kisses, too?

968
01:22:44,041 --> 01:22:45,750
-Come.
-He just wants chicken.

969
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:47,958
I see.

970
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:51,333
So you won't share
my sloppy kisses with anyone?

971
01:23:32,458 --> 01:23:33,625
Sorry.

972
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,375
No, it's okay.

973
01:23:37,583 --> 01:23:38,708
I understand.

974
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:24,958
Come.

975
01:24:26,375 --> 01:24:27,708
Why did you call me here?

976
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:32,875
Actually, the manager
told me to not go downstairs.

977
01:24:33,583 --> 01:24:36,791
He said there are strange people there,
and the place stinks.

978
01:24:38,416 --> 01:24:39,291
Please sit.

979
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:40,833
Yeah.

980
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:43,083
What else?

981
01:24:43,708 --> 01:24:45,416
What else did the manager say?

982
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:47,083
Nothing else.

983
01:24:52,625 --> 01:24:55,041
But I don't care about any of this.

984
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:00,208
You can come here.

985
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:03,000
We'll have our own small world.

986
01:25:03,708 --> 01:25:04,875
Our little corner.

987
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:06,833
Where no men are allowed.

988
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:10,458
There are men around here.

989
01:25:13,291 --> 01:25:15,708
By the way, didn't you see
my WhatsApp message?

990
01:25:16,875 --> 01:25:19,250
Yeah, I did.

991
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:21,375
I won't take any excuses.

992
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:23,708
You have to come for my birthday.

993
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:26,791
Shiv especially asked me to invite you.

994
01:25:28,583 --> 01:25:29,958
Please come?

995
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:32,041
My in-laws are after my life.

996
01:25:32,125 --> 01:25:34,666
They say there are
no ladies at the factory.

997
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:38,500
If they meet you,
they'll stop pestering me to quit.

998
01:25:39,625 --> 01:25:41,125
Please?

999
01:25:44,916 --> 01:25:45,750
All right.

1000
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:56,708
-Bharti. Come in.
-Sorry.

1001
01:25:56,791 --> 01:25:59,208
-No, I'll wait outside.
-Come.

1002
01:26:02,458 --> 01:26:05,250
Is she always dressed like this?

1003
01:26:05,333 --> 01:26:06,166
Yes.

1004
01:26:07,041 --> 01:26:10,416
-To what caste do Banerjees belong?
-They're Bengali Brahmins, Ma.

1005
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:16,625
Be cautious about who you mingle with.

1006
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:19,875
Your father-in-law
will be a head-priest next year.

1007
01:26:21,083 --> 01:26:22,875
-Yes.
-Okay?

1008
01:26:27,291 --> 01:26:28,500
From there, yes.

1009
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:29,666
From this side…

1010
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:32,208
Hello. How are you?

1011
01:26:32,291 --> 01:26:34,458
Please come.

1012
01:26:34,541 --> 01:26:36,958
Here comes the birthday girl. Please come.

1013
01:26:37,791 --> 01:26:39,041
I'll be back in two minutes.

1014
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:41,958
-Excuse me.
-God bless you.

1015
01:26:43,083 --> 01:26:45,333
Well, a cake contains eggs.

1016
01:26:45,416 --> 01:26:47,083
So my father wouldn't allow it.

1017
01:26:47,166 --> 01:26:49,208
He's stuck in a time-warp, you see.

1018
01:26:49,291 --> 01:26:51,000
You're right.

1019
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:54,208
So here's what I did. I worked
all night churning milk and grinding nuts

1020
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:57,916
and made, for my beautiful wife,
a pristine milk cake.

1021
01:26:58,541 --> 01:27:01,458
-Here, do the honors.
-Keep it there.

1022
01:27:01,541 --> 01:27:02,583
So I shouldn't serve her?

1023
01:27:03,416 --> 01:27:04,291
Yes, come.

1024
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,666
It's a birthday to remember.

1025
01:27:13,666 --> 01:27:15,875
You deserve this first.

1026
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:17,166
No, silly girl.

1027
01:27:20,291 --> 01:27:22,708
Are you in a time-warp, too?
Like my father.

1028
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:25,000
You're getting influenced. Here, eat.

1029
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,541
Why are you crying?

1030
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:31,708
Serve it to everyone.

1031
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:36,875
We got you a birthday cake, after all.
Help your sister-in-law.

1032
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:40,125
Please have some hot samosas.

1033
01:27:43,166 --> 01:27:44,583
Please have some.

1034
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:50,916
What's the matter?

1035
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:54,708
When I take a bath,

1036
01:27:55,958 --> 01:27:58,208
Shiv irons my clothes for me.

1037
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:03,208
My WhatsApp reads
"Shiv is typing" all day.

1038
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:08,250
Then his messages pop up.

1039
01:28:09,791 --> 01:28:12,416
"What are you up to?" With a smiley.

1040
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:18,291
Look.

1041
01:28:18,958 --> 01:28:22,041
He sends me
cute baby pictures every morning.

1042
01:28:25,291 --> 01:28:27,291
Shiv wants a child,

1043
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:30,666
and I can't even get myself to love him.

1044
01:28:34,458 --> 01:28:36,416
What should I do?

1045
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:38,125
Is there some defect in me?

1046
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:40,291
Should I see a doctor?

1047
01:28:42,291 --> 01:28:44,125
-Am I crazy?
-No.

1048
01:28:45,041 --> 01:28:49,666
It's crazy that I can't love
such a nice man, right?

1049
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:52,583
Please.

1050
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:56,000
Please help me.

1051
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:03,875
At times like this, I really miss Kavita.

1052
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,291
You loved Kavita a lot, right?

1053
01:29:16,125 --> 01:29:16,958
And me?

1054
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:22,208
Even more than Kavita.

1055
01:29:29,375 --> 01:29:33,333
Look, there's no defect
in us that needs to be fixed.

1056
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:35,791
Listen.

1057
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:40,541
You need to own your truth.

1058
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:42,375
That's the only way you can be happy.

1059
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:45,625
I've accepted my truth.

1060
01:29:47,291 --> 01:29:49,541
Now that you know a part of my truth…

1061
01:29:55,041 --> 01:29:56,791
another truth is that…

1062
01:29:58,041 --> 01:30:00,000
I'm not Bharti Banerjee.

1063
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,250
My name is Bharti Mandal.

1064
01:30:07,666 --> 01:30:08,791
I'm a Dalit.

1065
01:30:11,375 --> 01:30:14,458
My mother and granny are midwives,
like most women of our caste.

1066
01:30:17,291 --> 01:30:18,291
Someone's calling.

1067
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:20,958
Hello, sir.

1068
01:30:22,791 --> 01:30:23,625
Yes, sir.

1069
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:25,916
Sorry, sir.

1070
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,041
Yes, sir.

1071
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:32,375
The manager said I've made a big blunder.

1072
01:30:33,125 --> 01:30:34,875
Will you please come with me?

1073
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:36,833
Yeah, let's go.

1074
01:30:36,916 --> 01:30:39,750
I'm telling you the truth.

1075
01:30:42,916 --> 01:30:45,791
I think we are all prepared.

1076
01:30:45,875 --> 01:30:47,750
She's here.

1077
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:51,250
You wait outside.

1078
01:30:52,375 --> 01:30:54,125
Okay, she's here now.

1079
01:30:54,208 --> 01:31:00,500
Happy birthday to you

1080
01:31:00,583 --> 01:31:03,916
Happy birthday, dear Priya

1081
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,833
Happy birthday to you

1082
01:31:44,375 --> 01:31:47,250
Have some snacks, sir.
Before they go cold.

1083
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:51,250
Cut and distribute the cake to everyone.

1084
01:31:52,625 --> 01:31:56,625
No one's eating the samosas.
They're just sitting there.

1085
01:32:02,541 --> 01:32:05,041
Thanks to you, we've cut
a cake here for the first time.

1086
01:32:05,125 --> 01:32:05,958
Really?

1087
01:32:08,416 --> 01:32:10,416
So what if you cut a cake on Sunday?

1088
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,916
Your office can still celebrate on Monday.

1089
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Please have it.

1090
01:32:16,083 --> 01:32:18,166
I have an announcement to make.

1091
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:20,958
I've given orders to install
a ladies' toilet in our office.

1092
01:32:21,916 --> 01:32:24,250
-It was long overdue.
-Superb.

1093
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:42,416
All you workers
can share the rest of the cake.

1094
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:43,250
I've been looking for you everywhere.

1095
01:34:46,375 --> 01:34:47,500
Sorry.

1096
01:34:47,583 --> 01:34:49,666
The manager and others were around.

1097
01:34:50,291 --> 01:34:52,041
Or I would have fed you cake, too.

1098
01:35:02,666 --> 01:35:04,791
You were saying something earlier, right?

1099
01:35:04,875 --> 01:35:06,416
About owning my truth,

1100
01:35:07,208 --> 01:35:09,000
accepting my identity

1101
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:10,875
to find happiness?

1102
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:15,208
Priya, I'm going to tell you something.

1103
01:35:16,625 --> 01:35:18,083
Listen carefully.

1104
01:35:20,416 --> 01:35:22,125
It may sound strange at first.

1105
01:35:25,416 --> 01:35:28,875
You told me the other day
how Kavita is so happy with her life.

1106
01:35:30,083 --> 01:35:31,000
Think about it.

1107
01:35:31,708 --> 01:35:33,708
You guys had loads of fun in college.

1108
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:36,791
But now she's settled in
with her new family.

1109
01:35:37,791 --> 01:35:39,250
She has a respectable life.

1110
01:35:40,666 --> 01:35:44,666
In all these years,
she's never called you.

1111
01:35:48,083 --> 01:35:48,916
Why?

1112
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:53,000
Because she is really happy.

1113
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:56,958
She's found her identity as a mother.

1114
01:35:58,375 --> 01:36:01,916
Similarly, the thing
that will make you feel complete…

1115
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:05,375
is being a mother.

1116
01:36:07,583 --> 01:36:10,708
Once you become a mother,
you'll stop fighting within yourself.

1117
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,750
This storm inside you will settle down.

1118
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:19,250
Only a child can bring you closer to Shiv.

1119
01:36:20,333 --> 01:36:21,791
But I'm not even 30 yet.

1120
01:36:24,541 --> 01:36:27,166
Priya, I was 32 when I had a miscarriage.

1121
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:34,500
After three months, my husband left me.

1122
01:36:36,041 --> 01:36:37,541
Our palm lines often deceive us.

1123
01:36:38,916 --> 01:36:43,791
Anyway, you're fully ready to be a mother.

1124
01:36:46,375 --> 01:36:47,583
You have to decide.

1125
01:36:49,916 --> 01:36:51,875
Whether you want to suffer like me…

1126
01:36:52,958 --> 01:36:54,041
or live happily.

1127
01:36:55,166 --> 01:36:56,416
With respect.

1128
01:36:57,750 --> 01:36:58,666
With Shiv.

1129
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,041
Think about it.

1130
01:37:03,625 --> 01:37:07,125
My heart's not convinced, Miss Bharti.

1131
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:10,583
But thank you.

1132
01:37:12,958 --> 01:37:14,500
Without your help…

1133
01:37:16,166 --> 01:37:17,916
I don't know what I would've done.

1134
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,458
Really.

1135
01:37:23,791 --> 01:37:25,041
Thanks a lot.

1136
01:38:06,458 --> 01:38:08,333
I barely finished talking.

1137
01:38:08,416 --> 01:38:10,791
I just mentioned a baby
and Shiv got so excited.

1138
01:38:11,291 --> 01:38:13,791
He was so happy
that he started making sweets at midnight.

1139
01:38:14,875 --> 01:38:16,708
He woke everyone up.

1140
01:38:20,333 --> 01:38:22,166
That's when I understood what you meant.

1141
01:38:23,083 --> 01:38:24,166
You were right.

1142
01:38:25,333 --> 01:38:26,250
I'll have a baby.

1143
01:38:29,291 --> 01:38:30,500
You've made the right choice.

1144
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:32,583
But will you help me?

1145
01:38:34,416 --> 01:38:35,416
Sure.

1146
01:38:37,416 --> 01:38:40,833
Tell me. Do you get your period on time?

1147
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:42,583
Yes.

1148
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:46,333
Doing it ten days before
and after the menstrual cycle

1149
01:38:46,416 --> 01:38:48,583
increases your chances
of getting pregnant.

1150
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,083
The uterus opens up at this time.

1151
01:38:52,166 --> 01:38:54,541
Wow. You know so much.

1152
01:38:55,041 --> 01:38:56,083
How did you learn?

1153
01:38:56,916 --> 01:38:59,125
The same way you learnt palm-reading.

1154
01:39:01,708 --> 01:39:02,791
Right.

1155
01:39:02,875 --> 01:39:08,958
You'll have to keep track
of when you do it in a diary.

1156
01:39:10,625 --> 01:39:11,458
All right.

1157
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:18,166
Now I know when I'm supposed to do it…

1158
01:39:19,041 --> 01:39:20,416
But where?

1159
01:39:21,458 --> 01:39:22,791
There's no place at home.

1160
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:26,833
We're a family of 11
in a two-room apartment.

1161
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:33,625
No. You asked me
to feed him biscuits, right? I fed him.

1162
01:39:34,458 --> 01:39:35,750
Shiv must be on his way.

1163
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:38,416
Did the manager ask about me?

1164
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:40,583
Yes, I told him…

1165
01:39:40,666 --> 01:39:41,875
"Ladies' problems."

1166
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:46,333
Thank you. Also,
I had to tally April's expense sheet…

1167
01:39:46,416 --> 01:39:49,000
Yeah, I've done it.
It's in the expense folder.

1168
01:39:49,583 --> 01:39:50,458
Wow!

1169
01:39:51,333 --> 01:39:53,583
You did it in 20 minutes flat.

1170
01:39:53,666 --> 01:39:56,041
It takes me at least two hours.

1171
01:39:56,125 --> 01:39:57,791
Thank you so much.

1172
01:39:57,875 --> 01:39:58,791
Sloppy kisses.

1173
01:40:07,166 --> 01:40:08,250
Shiv's here.

1174
01:40:08,333 --> 01:40:09,791
I'll hang up now.

1175
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:11,208
Yeah, okay.

1176
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:13,041
All the best.

1177
01:40:13,625 --> 01:40:14,541
Thank you.

1178
01:40:25,583 --> 01:40:27,083
I have to leave in 15 minutes.

1179
01:40:27,166 --> 01:40:28,125
-What?
-Yes.

1180
01:40:28,208 --> 01:40:29,041
Okay, move.

1181
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,125
Sorry.

1182
01:40:31,208 --> 01:40:32,833
-Did you get hurt?
-No.

1183
01:40:37,375 --> 01:40:39,500
Forget about that.

1184
01:40:44,041 --> 01:40:45,041
Thank you.

1185
01:41:49,125 --> 01:41:49,958
That's it.

1186
01:41:54,791 --> 01:41:55,625
Are you okay?

1187
01:41:56,416 --> 01:41:57,875
Should this be happening now?

1188
01:41:57,958 --> 01:42:01,333
Morning sickness doesn't occur during
the last month. Must be indigestion.

1189
01:42:07,166 --> 01:42:08,000
Let's go?

1190
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:15,958
Are the reports okay?

1191
01:42:16,041 --> 01:42:19,375
Yes, sir. Just got
a check-up done. Everything's normal.

1192
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:21,291
Great.

1193
01:42:21,375 --> 01:42:24,041
Sir, you've been so helpful.

1194
01:42:25,125 --> 01:42:27,041
I'll be back in three months.

1195
01:42:27,666 --> 01:42:30,083
Please don't hire someone else.

1196
01:42:30,166 --> 01:42:31,625
I understand.

1197
01:42:32,375 --> 01:42:34,208
You must take complete rest.

1198
01:42:35,583 --> 01:42:37,375
But we can't stall work for three months.

1199
01:42:37,458 --> 01:42:40,083
No, sir, that's what
I wanted to discuss with you.

1200
01:42:40,166 --> 01:42:42,333
Bharti knows all the work.

1201
01:42:42,416 --> 01:42:44,250
She can manage until I'm back.

1202
01:42:45,416 --> 01:42:47,500
She's been helping me all these days.

1203
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,083
All right.

1204
01:42:54,125 --> 01:42:55,416
I can't say no to you.

1205
01:42:56,166 --> 01:42:57,375
Thank you, sir.

1206
01:42:57,458 --> 01:42:58,750
-Shall I leave?
-Sure.

1207
01:42:59,875 --> 01:43:04,500
4 MONTHS LATER

1208
01:43:04,583 --> 01:43:06,375
Bharti. When did you come?

1209
01:43:06,958 --> 01:43:08,208
Just now.

1210
01:43:11,833 --> 01:43:13,708
-Shut the door, please.
-Yes.

1211
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:28,833
Little prince.

1212
01:43:31,458 --> 01:43:32,500
Looks just like you.

1213
01:43:36,041 --> 01:43:36,916
Sit.

1214
01:43:43,625 --> 01:43:45,041
You look all settled.

1215
01:43:51,916 --> 01:43:55,166
-How's everyone in the office?
-Everyone's fine.

1216
01:44:03,541 --> 01:44:04,541
What happened?

1217
01:44:06,166 --> 01:44:07,000
Nothing.

1218
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:14,250
I wonder if I made a mistake.

1219
01:44:15,625 --> 01:44:18,875
All day I'm either changing diapers,
cooking or breastfeeding.

1220
01:44:19,666 --> 01:44:22,958
And Shiv seems weirdly distant lately.

1221
01:44:25,916 --> 01:44:27,291
He's very helpful.

1222
01:44:27,875 --> 01:44:30,458
But even his niceness
has started to prick me.

1223
01:44:37,166 --> 01:44:38,291
Kavita was right.

1224
01:44:40,166 --> 01:44:44,583
"You're married, but you still want
to frolic on a scooter with pompoms."

1225
01:44:46,750 --> 01:44:48,250
You're a mother now.

1226
01:44:49,375 --> 01:44:50,500
Focus on your baby.

1227
01:45:12,208 --> 01:45:14,291
Miss Bharti, thank you so much.

1228
01:45:14,791 --> 01:45:17,625
-Come on.
-No, really. I mean it.

1229
01:45:18,791 --> 01:45:21,250
She just praises you all the time.

1230
01:45:21,333 --> 01:45:25,458
She told us how you
encouraged and supported her.

1231
01:45:25,958 --> 01:45:30,833
Honestly, you've brought
all this joy to our family.

1232
01:45:30,916 --> 01:45:32,083
It's nothing.

1233
01:45:32,166 --> 01:45:34,500
We don't want to give you more trouble.

1234
01:45:35,291 --> 01:45:37,208
She'll resume work this month.

1235
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,125
-Right?
-Again?

1236
01:45:40,708 --> 01:45:43,041
The baby hasn't even
learned how to drink milk yet,

1237
01:45:43,125 --> 01:45:44,833
and you want her to start work?

1238
01:45:44,916 --> 01:45:46,833
-Ma--
-Bharti, you tell them.

1239
01:45:47,583 --> 01:45:51,500
Priya was telling me your mother
and grandma are midwives, right?

1240
01:45:51,583 --> 01:45:54,375
You must’ve learnt such work
considering the caste you belong to.

1241
01:45:54,458 --> 01:45:56,291
Put some sense into them.

1242
01:46:00,541 --> 01:46:01,500
Okay.

1243
01:46:02,541 --> 01:46:04,500
Make a separate file for cash flow.

1244
01:46:04,583 --> 01:46:06,375
Already did it, sir.
I emailed you yesterday.

1245
01:46:06,458 --> 01:46:08,375
I sent the purchase records, too.

1246
01:46:10,416 --> 01:46:11,416
Really?

1247
01:46:12,333 --> 01:46:13,333
Good.

1248
01:46:14,416 --> 01:46:15,250
Okay, sir.

1249
01:46:16,333 --> 01:46:17,208
By the way…

1250
01:46:18,375 --> 01:46:20,083
-I spoke to Priya.
-Really?

1251
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,333
She needs some more time.

1252
01:46:22,916 --> 01:46:24,291
Your mother's right.

1253
01:46:25,458 --> 01:46:28,333
It'll take you some months
to regain your health.

1254
01:46:29,458 --> 01:46:30,916
A mother needs proper nutrition.

1255
01:46:31,875 --> 01:46:35,333
And looking after the baby,
feeding him, changing diapers…

1256
01:46:35,416 --> 01:46:37,541
Being a mom is a full-time responsibility.

1257
01:46:38,166 --> 01:46:39,791
Feeding the baby, changing diapers, etc.

1258
01:46:39,875 --> 01:46:43,250
And then to handle
office work and all that stress.

1259
01:46:43,833 --> 01:46:45,791
And factory conditions are so unhygienic.

1260
01:46:46,416 --> 01:46:47,583
It stinks so much there.

1261
01:46:47,666 --> 01:46:49,458
It won't be good for her health.

1262
01:46:49,541 --> 01:46:51,416
She seemed a bit stressed.

1263
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:55,500
That would definitely
affect the baby's health.

1264
01:46:57,291 --> 01:46:58,291
Right?

1265
01:46:59,125 --> 01:47:00,625
She's quit the job.

1266
01:47:00,708 --> 01:47:04,000
So you can take over her responsibilities.

1267
01:47:04,666 --> 01:47:05,500
Yes, sir.

1268
01:47:06,208 --> 01:47:07,416
As you deem fit.

1269
01:47:31,166 --> 01:47:37,083
UNSPOKEN

1270
01:48:40,583 --> 01:48:41,458
Hot.

1271
01:48:51,458 --> 01:48:53,166
May I say something?

1272
01:48:54,541 --> 01:48:55,791
Say it.

1273
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,125
So should I leave?

1274
01:49:40,291 --> 01:49:41,500
Where do you want to go?

1275
01:49:42,916 --> 01:49:45,625
Madam?

1276
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:47,833
Bandra.

1277
01:49:52,208 --> 01:49:54,666
Don't walk away.
I'm not done talking to you!

1278
01:49:54,750 --> 01:49:57,125
One second! One second, just wait.

1279
01:49:57,208 --> 01:49:59,166
Don't "one second" me, Natasha.

1280
01:49:59,250 --> 01:50:01,541
-This is your entire plot.
-What plot?

1281
01:50:01,625 --> 01:50:03,333
Your game, your strategy, your tricks.

1282
01:50:03,416 --> 01:50:05,541
Every time
you accuse me of all these things.

1283
01:50:05,625 --> 01:50:07,083
Hey, I'm not accusing you.

1284
01:50:07,166 --> 01:50:09,000
I'm just trying
to show you the truth, Rohan.

1285
01:50:09,083 --> 01:50:10,125
What truth?

1286
01:50:10,208 --> 01:50:11,166
That I'm a bad father?

1287
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:13,958
-Okay, I'm a bad father. Happy?
-Did I say that?

1288
01:50:14,041 --> 01:50:15,708
Don't put words in my mouth, okay?

1289
01:50:15,791 --> 01:50:18,458
I'm just saying
that you're a distant father.

1290
01:50:18,541 --> 01:50:20,500
I've heard that. And I've also heard that…

1291
01:50:20,583 --> 01:50:22,916
I'm unavailable. I'm disinterested.

1292
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,625
That I don't talk to my daughter.

1293
01:50:25,208 --> 01:50:26,708
What does it all come up to?

1294
01:50:26,791 --> 01:50:28,541
That Rohan Sharma is a bad father.

1295
01:50:28,625 --> 01:50:31,125
Rohan, you are a very good father.

1296
01:50:31,208 --> 01:50:34,916
-Make an effort to talk to the child.
-You know what? I don't give a shit.

1297
01:50:36,958 --> 01:50:40,708
Don't use that term. It infuriates me!

1298
01:50:40,791 --> 01:50:43,583
I don't give a shit
about that either, so shut up.

1299
01:50:49,583 --> 01:50:53,000
Have you ever thought
about what all I do for Samaira?

1300
01:50:53,791 --> 01:50:57,333
I'm bloody moving heaven and Earth
to get a cochlear implant done.

1301
01:50:57,416 --> 01:51:00,458
Maybe you don't know,
but I've talked to her about this.

1302
01:51:00,541 --> 01:51:02,166
And she wants it, too.

1303
01:51:02,250 --> 01:51:03,416
You don't talk to her!

1304
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:05,458
You send her WhatsApp messages!

1305
01:51:05,541 --> 01:51:07,708
That's because
I'm bloody working day and night!

1306
01:51:07,791 --> 01:51:10,125
I don't have time
to learn the sign language!

1307
01:51:10,208 --> 01:51:13,250
Sign language is her only language, Rohan.

1308
01:51:13,958 --> 01:51:15,458
She's going deaf.

1309
01:51:16,166 --> 01:51:17,791
How many of us are you going to lose

1310
01:51:17,875 --> 01:51:20,500
before you
come to grips with this situation?

1311
01:51:20,583 --> 01:51:24,416
Just because you can't handle this,
doesn't mean you bring it out on her.

1312
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:26,666
You have to talk to her, at least.

1313
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:29,375
If you can't understand it,
it's your problem.

1314
01:51:29,458 --> 01:51:30,958
Don't bring it out on my child!

1315
01:51:31,041 --> 01:51:32,125
Enough!

1316
01:51:46,416 --> 01:51:48,750
I don't have as much spare time as you do

1317
01:51:48,833 --> 01:51:52,541
to learn painting,
poetry and sign language.

1318
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:57,041
Please understand, and leave me alone.

1319
01:52:07,708 --> 01:52:10,666
I will be on time
for dinner tonight. I promise. Bye.

1320
01:53:49,833 --> 01:53:52,416
She looks just like you.

1321
01:53:56,291 --> 01:53:59,083
She's way prettier than me.

1322
01:54:00,250 --> 01:54:04,541
Wait. You speak sign language?

1323
01:54:11,375 --> 01:54:15,250
When most people come here,
they keep trying to talk to me.

1324
01:54:17,875 --> 01:54:21,250
Some communicate through writing.

1325
01:54:21,333 --> 01:54:23,958
And I end up
getting tired of all that reading.

1326
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:28,375
You must know what I mean, right?

1327
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:35,750
Take this girl, for example.

1328
01:54:37,666 --> 01:54:40,375
When I was taking this photo…

1329
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:46,041
this girl just kept pouting and posing.

1330
01:54:46,125 --> 01:54:48,583
It just ended up looking silly.
I was fed up.

1331
01:54:49,958 --> 01:54:53,625
I think these days
people have forgotten how to be happy.

1332
01:54:54,708 --> 01:54:56,208
So then, what did you do?

1333
01:54:56,291 --> 01:54:57,916
I told this girl…

1334
01:54:58,625 --> 01:54:59,958
a Deaf joke.

1335
01:55:01,791 --> 01:55:04,625
And then she finally started laughing.

1336
01:55:04,708 --> 01:55:06,250
What was the joke?

1337
01:55:08,666 --> 01:55:10,416
Wait a minute…

1338
01:55:12,208 --> 01:55:17,041
You told this girl a joke. Told her, how?

1339
01:55:19,166 --> 01:55:21,333
With my mind.

1340
01:55:31,958 --> 01:55:33,041
Who is she?

1341
01:55:34,041 --> 01:55:36,416
That's you 15 years later.

1342
01:55:37,875 --> 01:55:40,625
Or maybe you 15 years ago.

1343
01:55:40,708 --> 01:55:43,125
Hey. I'm not that old.

1344
01:55:49,666 --> 01:55:50,541
Where's Dad?

1345
01:55:51,291 --> 01:55:52,125
Work.

1346
01:55:53,333 --> 01:55:54,166
Busy?

1347
01:55:55,666 --> 01:55:56,500
Busy.

1348
01:56:01,625 --> 01:56:02,666
Mom?

1349
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:09,166
Do you think I'll ever be
able to lead a normal life?

1350
01:56:09,250 --> 01:56:10,333
Of course, yes.

1351
01:56:11,708 --> 01:56:13,375
You're unable to hear.

1352
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,458
-But you are absolutely perfect.
-No.

1353
01:56:16,541 --> 01:56:18,125
I don't mean that.

1354
01:56:19,833 --> 01:56:23,375
I mean, do you think I'll be loved?

1355
01:56:23,458 --> 01:56:25,041
Like this?

1356
01:56:32,458 --> 01:56:35,291
You'll be loved a lot by someone someday.

1357
01:56:37,333 --> 01:56:40,416
Even more than I love you.

1358
01:56:42,625 --> 01:56:43,833
I don't think so.

1359
01:56:45,041 --> 01:56:47,125
Why are you saying this, honey?

1360
01:56:49,791 --> 01:56:50,916
Mom, look at you.

1361
01:56:52,041 --> 01:56:53,625
So pretty.

1362
01:56:53,708 --> 01:56:55,333
You can obviously hear.

1363
01:56:59,375 --> 01:57:01,208
Dad still doesn't love you.

1364
01:57:09,583 --> 01:57:13,750
And if someone can't love you,
then do I even stand a chance?

1365
01:57:38,291 --> 01:57:44,041
This old couple was just sitting
so happily and enjoying the rain.

1366
01:57:52,083 --> 01:57:54,333
Or maybe they were tired.

1367
01:57:55,708 --> 01:57:57,083
Fed up.

1368
01:57:57,791 --> 01:58:01,333
And just sat in the rain in despair.

1369
01:58:04,291 --> 01:58:05,500
I think…

1370
01:58:06,541 --> 01:58:08,583
the photographs you click…

1371
01:58:09,791 --> 01:58:11,583
have a little sadness in them.

1372
01:58:19,583 --> 01:58:23,750
What people see in my photographs,

1373
01:58:24,958 --> 01:58:26,500
it says less about me…

1374
01:58:27,958 --> 01:58:31,500
and more about them.

1375
01:58:38,791 --> 01:58:40,541
Could you ever hear?

1376
01:58:41,250 --> 01:58:43,541
Yes, with a cochlear implant.

1377
01:58:45,583 --> 01:58:47,208
If you're able to hear with an implant,

1378
01:58:47,291 --> 01:58:50,458
then why do you choose
to remain deaf and unhappy?

1379
01:58:50,541 --> 01:58:53,416
Because people always lied to me.

1380
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:55,125
So I got it removed.

1381
01:59:00,666 --> 01:59:01,791
Your lips…

1382
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:05,041
can always lie.

1383
01:59:06,416 --> 01:59:09,500
But your eyes always the truth.

1384
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:20,458
Do you know why books are better…

1385
01:59:21,666 --> 01:59:24,041
over movies?

1386
01:59:27,375 --> 01:59:33,500
Because when we read books,
we create our own world.

1387
01:59:35,083 --> 01:59:37,666
I could always hear sounds
with a hearing aid,

1388
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:41,625
but now I can create
my own soundtrack without them.

1389
01:59:47,291 --> 01:59:50,166
I can hear you in my mind.

1390
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:52,625
And your voice sounds just so beautiful.

1391
01:59:58,083 --> 02:00:01,166
You know I can hear, right?

1392
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:10,208
And I know what you sound like, too.

1393
02:00:21,666 --> 02:00:23,041
Nats, have a look at this.

1394
02:00:23,875 --> 02:00:26,458
There's a long waiting period
for cochlear implant.

1395
02:00:26,541 --> 02:00:29,750
But I have a friend who can
bring it down to six months. Good, right?

1396
02:00:33,583 --> 02:00:34,416
Now what?

1397
02:00:35,958 --> 02:00:38,000
You're planning for tomorrow,
but what about today?

1398
02:00:38,666 --> 02:00:40,291
What about right now?

1399
02:00:41,958 --> 02:00:43,416
Natasha, just stop it, okay?

1400
02:00:44,458 --> 02:00:45,666
It's such a simple thing.

1401
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:49,000
Just look into her eyes and talk to her.

1402
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,291
You make it sound like
I don't love my own daughter.

1403
02:00:52,375 --> 02:00:54,958
But your daughter
is gonna feel that you don't love her.

1404
02:00:59,291 --> 02:01:00,625
I know you love her.

1405
02:01:01,208 --> 02:01:02,666
Just go tell her that…

1406
02:01:03,250 --> 02:01:04,666
in her language.

1407
02:01:06,166 --> 02:01:08,000
Just make her laugh.

1408
02:01:08,666 --> 02:01:10,916
I'm really tired
of listening to your voice.

1409
02:01:14,583 --> 02:01:17,875
If you'll try to hear it
with your mind, you'll know.

1410
02:01:23,083 --> 02:01:24,708
What do you call a deaf dog?

1411
02:01:26,291 --> 02:01:28,875
Doesn't matter because it can't hear you.

1412
02:01:39,875 --> 02:01:42,500
How many
serious relationships have you had?

1413
02:01:43,708 --> 02:01:45,458
One. It's finished now.

1414
02:01:45,541 --> 02:01:49,041
What do you mean, "It's finished"?
I don't care, okay? Bye.

1415
02:01:50,875 --> 02:01:51,791
What happened?

1416
02:01:52,916 --> 02:01:53,791
Nothing important.

1417
02:01:54,791 --> 02:01:57,958
What "nothing important"?
You have to tell me, come on.

1418
02:01:58,041 --> 02:01:59,833
Please.

1419
02:01:59,916 --> 02:02:01,958
Till the time I tell you,
you won't let me relax?

1420
02:02:02,041 --> 02:02:03,125
Just relax, Natasha.

1421
02:02:03,208 --> 02:02:04,250
Don't tell me to relax.

1422
02:02:04,333 --> 02:02:06,791
That's the last thing you say
to somebody when they're angry.

1423
02:02:06,875 --> 02:02:09,000
That's because
you react to every little thing.

1424
02:02:09,083 --> 02:02:13,875
It's always the little things
that matter, not the big promises.

1425
02:02:13,958 --> 02:02:16,833
What's important
is that people understand each other.

1426
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:35,291
When was the last time
that you said "I love you" to someone?

1427
02:03:41,791 --> 02:03:43,125
Too scared.

1428
02:03:47,250 --> 02:03:48,416
Hi, Samaira.

1429
02:08:08,666 --> 02:08:10,208
I…

1430
02:08:11,166 --> 02:08:12,916
I love…

1431
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,541
I love you.

1432
02:08:47,166 --> 02:08:48,875
Hot.

1433
02:08:58,083 --> 02:08:59,791
May I say something?

1434
02:09:01,166 --> 02:09:02,416
Say it.

1435
02:09:06,916 --> 02:09:07,750
So should I leave?

1436
02:10:41,208 --> 02:10:42,666
It's here.

1437
02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:47,541
-You are supposed to respect me.
-Respect.

1438
02:10:49,583 --> 02:10:52,750
I think… I am… trying.

1439
02:10:54,125 --> 02:10:54,958
Mom.

1440
02:10:56,250 --> 02:10:57,333
Hey, Nats.

1441
02:10:57,416 --> 02:11:00,625
I asked her what she'd like for breakfast,
and you know what she said?

1442
02:11:00,708 --> 02:11:02,333
"I don't give a…"

1443
02:11:02,416 --> 02:11:04,583
Say. "I don't give a shit."

1444
02:11:08,125 --> 02:11:10,291
-What are you laughing at?
-At you.

1445
02:11:13,208 --> 02:11:15,875
To breakfast now, you naughty girl.

1446
02:11:15,958 --> 02:11:18,625
Come on. Chop-chop. Hurry up.

1447
02:12:10,875 --> 02:12:11,833
Nats?

1448
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:13,250
Who is it?

1449
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:15,833
Nobody.

1450
02:12:17,333 --> 02:12:19,166
It's just some salesman.

1451
02:12:21,083 --> 02:12:22,250
We don't need anything.

1452
02:12:25,416 --> 02:12:27,166
We don't need anything.

1453
02:12:40,250 --> 02:12:41,250
You…

1454
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:45,666
managed to lie…

1455
02:12:46,833 --> 02:12:48,541
with your eyes.

1456
02:12:51,875 --> 02:12:52,708
I'm sorry.

1457
02:13:55,958 --> 02:13:59,375
That man loved you?
