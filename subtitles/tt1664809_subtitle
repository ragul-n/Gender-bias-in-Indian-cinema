Mr. Reddy.

55
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:11,227
Our peopIe are angry.

56
00:06:14,603 --> 00:06:15,627
Veerabhadra..

57
00:06:15,737 --> 00:06:16,795
..is aIIotting most
of the seats for..

58
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:20,171
..the district counciI eIections
to the peopIe of his caste.

59
00:06:20,843 --> 00:06:22,811
What do you mean by 'PeopIe
of his caste'?

60
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,439
In our constituency there
are many peopIe..

61
00:06:26,482 --> 00:06:29,713
..of Veerabhadra's caste. We
have to Iook after everyone.

62
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:31,713
Veerabhadra is doing
the right thing.

63
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,448
He is not doing. He
is just saying.

64
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,056
What do you mean?
He is using you.

65
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:45,731
He is sIowIy taking your
power into his hands.

66
00:06:52,508 --> 00:06:55,443
You are sitting here at home and
he is going around town..

67
00:06:55,477 --> 00:06:59,311
..teIIing everyone that
he is the reaI Ieader.

68
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,281
You wiII face duaI bIows
because of that.

69
00:07:03,752 --> 00:07:07,381
How come? -You are becoming
weak among our peopIe.

70
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:10,420
And among other castes where
you shouId've won..

71
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:12,654
..some brownie points he is
waIking away with the credit.

72
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:23,903
Your grandfather once
toId you something..

73
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:27,459
Sister.

74
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,266
Wow! What a pIeasant surprise!

75
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:33,038
That's not the thing, sister.

76
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:34,568
You know how is it..

77
00:08:34,643 --> 00:08:35,871
We don't have time to breathe..

78
00:08:35,978 --> 00:08:37,707
..ever since his eIection
work has begun.

79
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:40,007
We have to make tea and snacks
for hundreds of peopIe.

80
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:41,879
There's aIways a rush
at home. -It happens.

81
00:08:41,984 --> 00:08:45,181
Greetings, sister.
So Veerabhadra..

82
00:08:45,854 --> 00:08:47,617
I hear some compIaints
against you.

83
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:49,448
Sister-in-Iaw, after marriage
even praises..

84
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:52,088
..sound Iike compIaints. -Ok.
Ok. Don't justify yourseIf now.

85
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:54,094
I got hoId of you after a Iong
time. PIease sit down.

86
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:55,094
I wiII make some coffee for you.

87
00:08:55,197 --> 00:08:57,688
Sir, Mr. Narsimha is caIIing
you. -I'II be back in a whiIe.

88
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,558
Sister..

89
00:08:59,635 --> 00:09:02,001
..I wiII prepare the rasam (sort
of tamarind soup) today.

90
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:06,865
But what happened?

91
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,205
Why did you canceI their
seats aII of a sudden?

92
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:12,106
Do I have to answer that?

93
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:15,011
I don't want to get
into an argument.

94
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,448
I have taken the decision.

95
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:18,846
But Mr. Reddy, you gave
me the right..

96
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:21,447
..to take decision regarding
this matter earIier.

97
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,916
Don't argue with me.

98
00:09:28,764 --> 00:09:30,197
You may not want to answer..

99
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:32,859
..but I have to answer my
peopIe. -Your peopIe?

100
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,762
When did they become
your peopIe?

101
00:09:37,873 --> 00:09:39,238
You think you are their Iord?

102
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:40,768
I gave them my word.

103
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:42,776
With whose permission did
you give them your word?

104
00:09:42,844 --> 00:09:44,835
Mr. Reddy, after working for
you for aII these years..

105
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,848
..and after doing whatever
I did for you..

106
00:09:47,182 --> 00:09:50,845
..you are asking me this
question today? -Hey!

107
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:55,078
Have you done us a favor
by working here?

108
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:58,855
In return Mr. Narsimha has
done so much for you.

109
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:01,258
I understand everything,
Nagamani. Everything.

110
00:10:02,564 --> 00:10:04,589
Mr. Reddy, I have been
patient tiII now.

111
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:07,165
Before this matter
gets worse.. -Hey!

112
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,597
You are threatening
Mr. Narsimha?

113
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:14,766
What's that Iook?

114
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:18,473
Look down. Look down!

115
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:27,755
No, no, no. -It wiII
taste great.

116
00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:29,947
What are you doing! So much
spice? He won't eat it.

117
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:31,185
No! If you won't add
this much spice..

118
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:32,752
..they won't even touch
it here. Add some more.

119
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:34,591
That's why there's so much
aggression in you peopIe.

120
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:36,028
They Iike it very spicy. -Nari.

121
00:10:37,032 --> 00:10:39,398
Let's go from here. -What
happened? -I said Iet's go.

122
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:42,160
But what happened?
-I said Iet's go.

123
00:10:42,404 --> 00:10:44,167
Let's go from here.
Let's go. -What..

124
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:45,672
At Ieast Iet me wash my hand.

125
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:54,438
What happened? Why is
Veerabhadra Ieaving in a huff?

126
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,608
Don't take that traitor's
name in front of me.

127
00:10:57,185 --> 00:10:59,619
You know what aII he was
saying behind my back?

128
00:11:16,571 --> 00:11:20,200
Society is nobody's
personaI property.

129
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:23,609
Higher caste. Lower caste.
It's aII rubbish.

130
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:28,740
This is just one man's battIe
against another.

131
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:32,616
Which book says it, in which
Veda is it written..

132
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:37,216
..that we are born to be their
sIaves and to serve them?

133
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:40,359
And if it's written anywhere,
then burn that writing down.

134
00:11:40,595 --> 00:11:43,029
Cut the tongues of those who
caII you untouchabIe.

135
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:46,532
Gouge out those eyes which don't
see you as human beings.

136
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:51,800
TiII now no one had dared
to Iook into your eyes.

137
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:54,132
And he..

138
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:57,745
He used to Iive at your
feet tiII yesterday.

139
00:11:59,548 --> 00:12:01,448
And today he is abusing you
in front of everyone.

140
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:06,314
You get a chance onIy once in
Iife to prove your worth.

141
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:10,147
And no one gives you that
chance. You have to snatch it.

142
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:14,122
He turned your peopIe
against you.

143
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,598
Mr. Narsimha, you fed
miIk to that snake..

144
00:12:21,736 --> 00:12:23,397
..and today he is ready
to bite you.

145
00:12:23,472 --> 00:12:27,602
The sickIe that your ancestors
used to cut the harvest..

146
00:12:27,642 --> 00:12:32,443
..that they cuItivated
for those rogues..

147
00:12:32,547 --> 00:12:34,378
Now the time has come to
use the same sickIes..

148
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:36,576
..to cut their heads and drench
this Iand with their bIood.

149
00:12:36,618 --> 00:12:41,180
From this moment onwards we are
going to fight for our rights.

150
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:48,628
What shouId be done if a branch
revoIts against the stem!

151
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:55,325
We shouId cut it. We
shouId cut it out.

152
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:00,965
Get rid of him.

153
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:13,545
Durga.

154
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,052
You know Manda, don't
you? -Manda, who?

155
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:22,157
Veerbhadra's right hand man..

156
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:26,865
You know Lord Shiva's tempIe..

157
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,870
..behind KaiIash generaI
stores, right?

158
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,608
His home is right next to it.

159
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:55,055
Hey! -Don't be scared.

160
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:57,427
If we had come to kiII you,
you wouId be dead by now.

161
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,424
Mr. Nagamani wants
to taIk to you.

162
00:14:01,202 --> 00:14:03,796
We wiII send your husband back.
But if you taIk to anyone..

163
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:04,395
..about this incident before
he comes..

164
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:06,736
..your husband wiII come back,
but without his head.

165
00:14:09,711 --> 00:14:11,474
You have onIy two choices.

166
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:18,384
Either you join hands with
us and kiII Veerabhadra..

167
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:22,451
..or say no to us and die.

168
00:14:26,795 --> 00:14:32,665
Look, Manda, we can kiII
Veerabhadra without your heIp..

169
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:36,829
..but we need you to kiII both
him and his reputation.

170
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:40,632
If we kiII Veerbhadra his
voters and supporters..

171
00:14:40,675 --> 00:14:44,634
..wiII turn against us
in the eIections.

172
00:14:46,414 --> 00:14:48,405
You are his most IoyaI man.

173
00:14:48,883 --> 00:14:54,253
If you kiII him, peopIe
wiII doubt..

174
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,587
..the great man himseIf.

175
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:04,428
And aIso, what wiII you get
if you work for him?

176
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,156
Today you are his servant.

177
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:07,661
Tomorrow you wiII be..

178
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,871
..his sons Shankar's and
Pratap's servant.

179
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,805
But if you kiII him..

180
00:15:24,653 --> 00:15:26,382
You can become the Ieader.

181
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:33,188
After Ravan's death Ram didn't
get Lanka's throne..

182
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:38,699
..but Vibhishan got it.

183
00:16:32,554 --> 00:16:34,579
What happened? -There are
some stones on the road.

184
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,987
Must be someone's mischief.

185
00:16:50,872 --> 00:16:52,032
Go back. Go back.

186
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:53,331
Go. Go.

187
00:16:58,613 --> 00:16:59,807
Hey, Veerabhadra.

188
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:02,943
Veerabhadra, we are
here to kiII you.

189
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:06,486
There are 40-50 innocent peopIe
aIong with you in the bus.

190
00:17:07,388 --> 00:17:11,757
To kiII you we wiII kiII
them aII if required.

191
00:17:12,293 --> 00:17:15,729
Now wiII you hide among
them Iike a woman..

192
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:19,961
..and be the cause of their
deaths or wiII you come out..

193
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:24,537
..Iike a man and die
aIone. You decide.

194
00:17:24,572 --> 00:17:25,766
Where are you going?

195
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:27,539
You are not going anywhere.

196
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:29,472
Leave me. -They wiII kiII you.

197
00:17:29,544 --> 00:17:30,568
You don't go. Don't
go. -Don't go.

198
00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:32,168
You don't worry at aII.
-You don't go.

199
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,907
Nothing wiII happen to
you. -PIease don't go.

200
00:17:33,982 --> 00:17:35,472
Nothing wiII happen to you.
-PIease don't go..

201
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,383
I'II taIk to them. -PIease
don't go. -Don't go.

202
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,249
I said I wiII taIk to
them. -Don't go out.

203
00:17:41,122 --> 00:17:42,555
Stop. Stop.

204
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,616
Stop. Stop. PIease come inside.
How can I? -PIease come inside.

205
00:17:46,728 --> 00:17:48,923
It's a matter of many
Iives. Leave me.

206
00:17:49,731 --> 00:17:52,256
Who are you? Come in front
of me and taIk.

207
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:01,306
Manda. -Yes.

208
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:07,245
You rogue! -Hey, Manda,
what's happened to you?

209
00:18:07,315 --> 00:18:10,682
Why are you doing this?
Sister-in-Iaw, He is a thief.

210
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,183
Sister-in-Iaw, he was trying
to fooI everyone.

211
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:15,682
What did you think? You thought
we won't find out?

212
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:18,683
You.. You cheated everyone.

213
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,056
Today on everyone's behaIf I
have come to teach you a Iesson.

214
00:18:22,697 --> 00:18:24,460
On whose behaIf? What are
you taIking about?

215
00:18:24,566 --> 00:18:25,590
I am taIking on everyone's
behaIf.

216
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,962
What's happened to you? -What
are you taIking about?

217
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:28,968
TiII now I used to think
that you are a good man.

218
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:32,330
That's why I worked for you.

219
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:34,534
Do you aII know this?

220
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,040
He devoured party's fund.

221
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:40,905
I wiII kiII you.

222
00:18:41,082 --> 00:18:43,243
KiII me if you want to.. -No.
-..but don't Iecture.

223
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:44,942
KiII him, Manda.

224
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:49,052
I must get the punishment for
trusting a man Iike you.

225
00:18:49,123 --> 00:18:50,886
Come on, kiII me. -Shoot
him, Manda.

226
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,359
Move away. Shoot me. -PIease
come in. -Shoot him, Manda.

227
00:18:53,795 --> 00:18:55,956
PIease come in. -Shoot me.
What are you staring at?

228
00:18:56,064 --> 00:18:57,463
Shoot me. -Manda, shoot him.

229
00:18:58,366 --> 00:19:00,732
Shoot him, Manda. -Shoot me.

230
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:02,993
Shoot me. What are
you Iooking at?

231
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:07,038
Shoot me. What are you waiting
for? -Shoot me.

232
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,912
You remember the deaI
with Nagamani?

233
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:22,953
Everyone must see
you kiIIing him.

234
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:24,115
Go. Go and kiII him.

235
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,121
Don't ruin everything, Manda.
Go and kiII him fast.

236
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:30,929
Leave me. Leave me.

237
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:32,657
Everyone is watching.
Go and kiII him.

238
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:35,836
Go, or eIse the deaI is off. Go.

239
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,367
Everyone is watching. Go.

240
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:42,875
Leave me. Leave me.

241
00:19:47,382 --> 00:19:48,406
No.

242
00:19:50,184 --> 00:19:52,084
No. No.

243
00:19:52,654 --> 00:19:54,485
No. No.

244
00:19:56,691 --> 00:19:58,090
Manda, no. Manda, no.

245
00:19:58,293 --> 00:19:59,658
Manda, no.

246
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:01,258
Manda, no. Manda, no.

247
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,389
Leave me. Leave me. Leave me.

248
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,324
Manda, no.

249
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:07,592
Manda, no.

250
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:08,658
Manda, no.

251
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:10,661
No!

252
00:20:26,387 --> 00:20:29,083
Unfortunate. Quite unfortunate.

253
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:32,590
Your own man kiIIed him.

254
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:35,092
What can anyone do..

255
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:37,687
..if the enemy is hidden
in our house?

256
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,967
I know very weII who kiIIed him.

257
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,665
Manda kiIIed your father in
front of a hundred peopIe.

258
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:47,031
Manda.

259
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:54,072
Manda kiIIed my father
in front of everyone.

260
00:20:57,051 --> 00:20:58,609
But I know that behind Manda..

261
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:05,719
..there are Narsimha Reddy
and Nagamani Reddy.

262
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:08,318
Manda aIone didn't kiII him.

263
00:21:09,063 --> 00:21:10,428
It was done by those peopIe..

264
00:21:10,498 --> 00:21:12,261
..for whom my father worked
aII these years.

265
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:16,266
Veerbhadra isn't dead yet.

266
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:19,429
His sons are aIive.

267
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:22,403
So they want bIoodshed.

268
00:21:23,511 --> 00:21:27,174
I wiII shed their bIood.

269
00:21:28,216 --> 00:21:30,776
BIood wiII spiII every day
and every moment here now.

270
00:21:31,953 --> 00:21:37,414
And it won't stop tiII this Iand
is drenched with their bIood.

271
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:13,409
Anandpur. What sort of a
pIace is your Anandpur?

272
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:15,052
It's a nice pIace to Iive.

273
00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:17,490
It's an even better
pIace to Ieave.

274
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:22,022
So you wiII stay in
the city? -Yes.

275
00:23:23,064 --> 00:23:25,430
What's your father's
name? -Veerabhadra.

276
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,265
Are you a Brahmin? -No.

277
00:23:28,402 --> 00:23:29,596
Do you beIieve in God?

278
00:23:34,775 --> 00:23:36,140
First I beIieve in myseIf.

279
00:23:37,178 --> 00:23:39,373
You couIdn't touch
his feet? -Whose?

280
00:23:39,981 --> 00:23:42,449
Yes, his feet. Father wouId've
been impressed.

281
00:23:44,085 --> 00:23:47,350
Nandini, I never do
what I don't Iike.

282
00:23:47,822 --> 00:23:49,346
What's there in it not to Iike?

283
00:23:49,423 --> 00:23:50,822
What's the need for aII this?

284
00:23:51,192 --> 00:23:53,285
I am marrying you. I'm not
marrying your father.

285
00:23:53,861 --> 00:23:58,230
But if you wish I have no
probIem in touching your feet.

286
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,027
You want a sIap from me?

287
00:24:01,636 --> 00:24:02,830
And what did you say?

288
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:06,802
First I beIieve in myseIf and
then I beIieve in God.

289
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:11,201
He's in you. He's in me.

290
00:24:12,413 --> 00:24:13,539
He's in my father too.

291
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:16,341
What wouId you have Iost if
you had said one smaII Iie?

292
00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:18,608
I never Iie. -Now don't Iie.

293
00:24:18,953 --> 00:24:20,352
Hey, where's the cherry in this?

294
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:24,184
If this was our first meeting,
forget about taIking to you..

295
00:24:24,258 --> 00:24:26,021
..I wouIdn't even have
Iooked at you.

296
00:24:27,428 --> 00:24:29,419
I don't understand why
you are so difficuIt.

297
00:24:29,497 --> 00:24:33,092
Nandini, honest peopIe aIways
come across as difficuIt.

298
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:34,359
Just shut up.

299
00:24:35,036 --> 00:24:36,401
TaIking to you is of no use.

300
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,174
What happened?

301
00:24:51,385 --> 00:24:52,409
Nandini..

302
00:24:54,288 --> 00:24:56,347
My.. My father..

303
00:24:58,192 --> 00:25:00,251
I need to go home. UrgentIy.

304
00:25:10,638 --> 00:25:13,106
'What Nandini doesn't
know now is that..'

305
00:25:13,774 --> 00:25:18,438
'..Pratap is waIking down
a path of no return.'

306
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:25,849
'After Veerabhadra's
brutaI murder..'

307
00:25:25,953 --> 00:25:28,251
'..Pratap's brother Shankar
who couIdn't..'

308
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:29,846
'..attack Nagamani Reddy..'

309
00:25:30,057 --> 00:25:32,150
'..and Narsimha Deva
Reddy because..'

310
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:34,023
'..of the increased security..'

311
00:25:34,095 --> 00:25:36,996
'..was Iiving in the forest and
attacking their supporters.'

312
00:26:47,134 --> 00:26:50,535
'As a consequence of these
gueriIIa attacks..'

313
00:26:50,604 --> 00:26:53,971
'..a new character makes an
entry into Raktha Chritra..'

314
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:59,505
'..who was worse than a demon.'

315
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:05,648
'He is Nagamani Reddy's
son Bukka Reddy.'

316
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:45,519
'On hearing about Shankar's
expIoits he started kiIIing..'

317
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:49,927
'..Shankar's men in the most
brutaI way possibIe.'

318
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:32,794
'Bukka Reddy was not just an
exponent of vioIence..'

319
00:28:33,574 --> 00:28:38,637
'..but he moIested every
woman he fancied..'

320
00:28:38,846 --> 00:28:43,010
'..irrespective of their caste,
creed, reIigion, age..'

321
00:28:43,117 --> 00:28:45,847
'..pIace or time..'

322
00:28:56,363 --> 00:28:59,196
Leave me. Leave me. HeIp!

323
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,569
Leave me. Leave me.

324
00:29:26,026 --> 00:29:27,186
Leave me. Leave me.

325
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:29,127
Rajeev. Rajeev.

326
00:29:30,097 --> 00:29:32,725
Leave me. Leave me. HeIp!

327
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:45,576
'Consumed with the cocktaiI of
aIcohoI, women and power..'

328
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:49,510
'..day and night he
proved himseIf..'

329
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,517
'..to be worse than a demon.'

330
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,844
No. No.

331
00:29:54,388 --> 00:29:56,117
Forgive me. Forgive me.

332
00:29:58,692 --> 00:30:01,661
'Bukka had aIready dragged
Anandpur back from..'

333
00:30:02,196 --> 00:30:05,290
'..20th century to a different
era where there we no ruIes.'

334
00:30:05,966 --> 00:30:09,527
'And now on hearing about
Shankar's brother..'

335
00:30:09,837 --> 00:30:13,898
'..Pratap's arrivaI he came
out of his burrow.'

336
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:15,499
Stop.

337
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,502
Where are you going?

338
00:30:18,345 --> 00:30:20,609
We heard Shankar's brother
Pratap Ravi has come.

339
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:26,542
Wait tiII the eIections
are over.

340
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:30,984
TiII eIection are over..

341
00:30:41,635 --> 00:30:43,068
Come up stair.

342
00:30:46,073 --> 00:30:48,041
'The number of peopIe
with a gun in hand..'

343
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,203
'..kept increasing
in this region.'

344
00:30:51,312 --> 00:30:54,110
'Instead of tiIIing
their farms..'

345
00:30:54,582 --> 00:30:56,447
'..farmers started manufacturing
bombs.'

346
00:30:56,984 --> 00:30:59,350
'BIood repIaced water
in canaIs.'

347
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:03,051
'Democracy turned into ajoke.'

348
00:31:04,058 --> 00:31:07,653
'The age-oId poverty and poor
man's fight for survivaI..'

349
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:14,525
'..when IandIords and
capitaIists are on assauIt.'

350
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:17,897
'Now Pratap Ravi stepped
into such environment..

351
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:21,067
..of Anandpur..'

352
00:31:31,785 --> 00:31:32,809
He's Durga.

353
00:31:34,355 --> 00:31:36,186
He's one of those who
kiIIed father.

354
00:31:38,492 --> 00:31:40,255
The rest of them wiII
aIso be caught.

355
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:50,430
Enough.. -What are the
poIicemen doing?

356
00:31:51,305 --> 00:31:53,773
Matters have reached this far
onIy because of the poIicemen.

357
00:31:54,942 --> 00:31:55,966
Forget it.

358
00:31:58,379 --> 00:31:59,903
You don't interfere in aII this.

359
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,974
You concentrate on your studies.

360
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,816
Father aIso wanted the same.

361
00:32:10,724 --> 00:32:11,748
You study.

362
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:20,391
Look Ravi, other than taking
revenge from father's kiIIers..

363
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:24,628
..I aIso have the responsibiIity
to..

364
00:32:25,172 --> 00:32:28,767
..get justice for his foIIowers.

365
00:32:31,145 --> 00:32:35,809
TiII everyone doesn't
get justice..

366
00:32:38,185 --> 00:32:41,916
..I won't stop my struggIe.
Forget it.

367
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:49,557
How is mother? -'With his
father's brutaI death..'

368
00:32:50,097 --> 00:32:53,760
'..Pratap's dream of a great
future burst Iike a bubbIe.'

369
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:56,764
'Like many peopIe
present here..'

370
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,029
'..Pratap started understanding
the..'

371
00:32:59,506 --> 00:33:01,098
'..reaIities of his homeIand..'

372
00:33:01,642 --> 00:33:04,372
'..which he had been hearing
since his chiIdhood.'

373
00:33:05,546 --> 00:33:07,480
'It's not a fight for bIood.'

374
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:11,451
'It's a fight for seIf-esteem,
for identity.'

375
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:14,587
'But at present it
can't be toId..'

376
00:33:15,122 --> 00:33:21,391
'..how deep or above Pratap
is of this whirIpooI.'

377
00:33:22,496 --> 00:33:23,520
How is Shankar?

378
00:33:24,998 --> 00:33:26,966
How is he? -Yes.

379
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:32,270
Your friend.. some girI
caIIed Nandini caIIed.

380
00:33:32,673 --> 00:33:34,231
Why wouId anyone kiII anyone..

381
00:33:34,775 --> 00:33:36,208
..so brutaIIy without a reason?

382
00:33:38,011 --> 00:33:40,002
Such peopIe wiII stay
in our house?

383
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,148
Is it visibIe on anyone's
face that he..

384
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:44,180
..wouId have support
of such peopIe?

385
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:46,777
Thank God that you are
sitting safe at home.

386
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:53,521
Look, Nandini. Everyone
commits mistakes.

387
00:33:54,695 --> 00:33:55,992
Forget Pratap now.

388
00:33:58,265 --> 00:34:02,167
Father, I Iove Pratap.

389
00:34:04,505 --> 00:34:06,996
TiII I know what's the reason
behind aII this..

390
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:10,902
..I won't change my
decision. -Look..

391
00:34:14,581 --> 00:34:15,605
HeIIo!

392
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
Nandini..

393
00:34:22,556 --> 00:34:23,580
Pratap.

394
00:34:25,459 --> 00:34:27,324
Pratap? Where are you?

395
00:34:27,528 --> 00:34:30,190
I hope you are fine. What
happened, Pratap?

396
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:33,991
They kiIIed my father, Nandini.

397
00:34:34,535 --> 00:34:39,063
No! -I never knew that
they couId do so.

398
00:34:41,008 --> 00:34:43,101
Mother and sister-in-Iaw
are unabIe to bear it.

399
00:34:44,077 --> 00:34:47,478
Now, poIice are Iooking
for my brother.

400
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,874
Shankar.

401
00:35:24,284 --> 00:35:25,308
We found him.

402
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:29,045
AIive? -Yes.

403
00:35:54,948 --> 00:35:56,006
Goodbye.

404
00:36:17,271 --> 00:36:21,105
Where is Shankar? -Shankar?
Who is Shankar?

405
00:36:21,575 --> 00:36:22,633
My brother, Shankar.

406
00:36:23,944 --> 00:36:26,105
Who are you? -My name
is Pratap. -So?

407
00:36:26,914 --> 00:36:28,814
I Iearnt that my
brother is here.

408
00:36:29,049 --> 00:36:31,210
Here? Where? -Here in
your poIice station.

409
00:36:32,386 --> 00:36:34,911
Who toId you? -Look,
I've Iearnt it.

410
00:36:35,455 --> 00:36:37,446
You've arrested him today.
Where's my brother?

411
00:36:37,491 --> 00:36:41,188
Hey! Lower your voice! Lower it!

412
00:36:42,229 --> 00:36:44,094
I wiII thrash you
bIack and bIue.

413
00:36:44,197 --> 00:36:46,495
Pratap hasn't done
anything wrong.

414
00:36:46,934 --> 00:36:48,629
He doesn't have any
criminaI case too.

415
00:36:48,702 --> 00:36:50,795
It's your responsibiIity to
Iet him meet his brother..

416
00:36:50,871 --> 00:36:52,498
..as per the Iaw.

417
00:36:57,277 --> 00:36:58,301
Who are you?

418
00:36:58,879 --> 00:36:59,903
I am the Iawyer.

419
00:37:00,681 --> 00:37:04,640
Idiot! Here I am the
Iaw. I am the Iaw.

420
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:12,057
You want to meet your
brother? -Yes.

421
00:37:13,427 --> 00:37:15,019
Come, I wiII show you. Come.

422
00:37:15,595 --> 00:37:19,087
See him. Go and meet
your brother.

423
00:37:34,448 --> 00:37:35,710
Did you meet your brother?

424
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,647
I kiIIed him as per the Iaw.

425
00:37:40,454 --> 00:37:41,853
Now do whatever you can do.

426
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,796
Let go off him!

427
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,414
Let go off me!

428
00:38:55,429 --> 00:38:56,453
Let go off me!

429
00:38:58,365 --> 00:39:00,629
Idiot! You are done for today!

430
00:39:01,068 --> 00:39:03,036
How dare you hit me!

431
00:39:32,365 --> 00:39:33,992
Ramesh, take care
of sister-in-Iaw.

432
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:36,160
We are taking Pratap aIong
with us. Pratap!

433
00:39:58,258 --> 00:40:02,285
Mr. Reddy, we Iost both my
husband and my eIder son.

434
00:40:03,396 --> 00:40:05,762
Now I don't have anyone
other than Pratap.

435
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,658
Sister. Sister.

436
00:40:09,436 --> 00:40:12,098
We'II go away from here.
We don't want anything.

437
00:40:12,472 --> 00:40:14,030
We wiII go far away from here.

438
00:40:14,241 --> 00:40:15,367
I wiII pacify Pratap.

439
00:40:15,642 --> 00:40:17,109
He'II sureIy Iisten to me.

440
00:40:17,811 --> 00:40:20,041
My son never says
no to me, sister.

441
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,217
Mr. Reddy. Mr. Reddy..
I beg of you.

442
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:27,780
Sir, if my son has any
feeIing of revenge..

443
00:40:27,854 --> 00:40:29,287
..I wiII ask him to wipe it out.

444
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:30,720
I wiII ask him to wipe it out.

445
00:40:31,024 --> 00:40:32,651
I assure you, sir. -Stop it!

446
00:40:32,692 --> 00:40:34,057
I assure.. -Stop it!

447
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,892
You think by asking us
to not harm your son..

448
00:40:40,233 --> 00:40:41,495
..you are doing us a favor?

449
00:40:43,103 --> 00:40:44,161
Your husband..

450
00:40:45,038 --> 00:40:47,370
We took care of your husband.

451
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,874
And he tried to bite
us in return.

452
00:40:50,644 --> 00:40:51,770
He tried to bite us.

453
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:55,410
Your son Shankar tried
to kiII Narsimha.

454
00:40:56,283 --> 00:40:58,046
Go. Go away!

455
00:40:58,418 --> 00:41:01,387
Your son, Pratap cannot escape
by hiding in the forest..

456
00:41:01,454 --> 00:41:04,514
We wiII kiII him at any cost.
-Hey, throw her out!

457
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:08,124
Throw her out! -Sister!
Sister! -Hey!

458
00:41:08,361 --> 00:41:11,853
Sister, pIease Iisten to me!
-Throw her out. -Sister!

459
00:41:18,638 --> 00:41:21,300
Pratap, they have got power.
They have poIice's support.

460
00:41:21,841 --> 00:41:23,604
They have the government
on their side.

461
00:41:24,911 --> 00:41:27,436
But stiII we wiII see how
Iong they wiII escape.

462
00:41:27,814 --> 00:41:29,907
We revere your father
and brother Shankar..

463
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,813
..more than you do.

464
00:41:31,885 --> 00:41:34,786
Not just you, but they
have got enemies..

465
00:41:34,854 --> 00:41:38,051
..aII over Anandpur. You stay
here. Don't be scared.

466
00:41:38,425 --> 00:41:39,858
We wiII protect you.

467
00:41:39,926 --> 00:41:42,190
We'II take revenge.

468
00:41:42,395 --> 00:41:45,057
No. I wiII take that revenge.

469
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:46,358
Don't get emotionaI.

470
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,364
Have you ever heId a gun
in your Iife? -No.

471
00:41:52,172 --> 00:41:53,366
Not with the gun..

472
00:41:57,911 --> 00:41:59,970
I wiII stab each one of them
to death with a knife.

473
00:42:06,653 --> 00:42:09,451
We can understand your anger.

474
00:42:09,656 --> 00:42:12,216
It's easier said than done.

475
00:42:12,525 --> 00:42:13,617
Leave this to us.

476
00:42:14,394 --> 00:42:20,629
My father.. My brother..
My mother..

477
00:42:22,202 --> 00:42:23,499
Revenge wiII be mine too.

478
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:33,110
We'II pIan to kiII Narsimha,
Nagamani, Manda..

479
00:42:33,647 --> 00:42:37,105
..aII the three of them at
one go at the same time.

480
00:42:37,817 --> 00:42:41,275
No. Not at once.

481
00:42:42,455 --> 00:42:45,253
One at a time. One by one.

482
00:42:46,192 --> 00:42:51,220
After kiIIing one, I wiII
give another one..

483
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:53,892
..specific time of his death.

484
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,834
So that he shouId feeI
the fear of death.

485
00:43:00,006 --> 00:43:01,906
I won't Iet them die so easiIy.

486
00:43:02,876 --> 00:43:08,473
PIanned by Nagamani, impIemented
by Manda..

487
00:43:09,382 --> 00:43:11,077
..and ordered by Narsimha Reddy.

488
00:43:11,484 --> 00:43:12,883
I wiII kiII the three of them.

489
00:43:14,654 --> 00:43:19,091
My mother used to treat
Narsimha Reddy's wife..

490
00:43:19,993 --> 00:43:21,790
..Gomati as her own sister.

491
00:43:22,529 --> 00:43:24,520
My mother was humiIiated
in front of her.

492
00:43:25,498 --> 00:43:29,298
My mother was kicked and
she didn't utter a word.

493
00:43:35,175 --> 00:43:38,906
First of aII.. I wiII
make her cry.

494
00:45:59,052 --> 00:46:02,146
Hey, when you father and son
were roaming in the town..

495
00:46:02,789 --> 00:46:04,154
..he came here and kiIIed him.

496
00:46:06,292 --> 00:46:10,285
His mother used to
caII me sister.

497
00:46:10,763 --> 00:46:12,560
She came here and begged
me to spare her son.

498
00:46:13,533 --> 00:46:16,991
Why didn't you kiII him earIier?
You just kept thinking.

499
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,335
Why? Why didn't you
kiII him earIier?

500
00:46:19,439 --> 00:46:20,599
Why you didn't kiII him?

501
00:46:21,074 --> 00:46:23,304
Why didn't you kiII him?
Why didn't you kiII him?

502
00:46:23,943 --> 00:46:25,968
Why didn't you kiII him?
Why didn't you kiII him?

503
00:46:30,283 --> 00:46:32,114
Hey Bukka.

504
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:34,280
Shut up! Just shut up!

505
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:39,383
Aunt is right.

506
00:46:41,127 --> 00:46:43,061
We shouId've kiIIed him
right in the beginning.

507
00:46:44,364 --> 00:46:45,695
This happened because of you.

508
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:47,557
Wait tiII the eIections
are over.

509
00:46:47,634 --> 00:46:49,295
You asked me to wait tiII
the eIections are over.

510
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:50,700
You wiII make his dead body
contest the eIection now?

511
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:52,398
Bukka. -Shut up!

512
00:46:54,774 --> 00:46:55,900
Keep your mouth shut!

513
00:47:06,085 --> 00:47:08,918
Aunt, I'm Nandini speaking.

514
00:47:09,822 --> 00:47:12,757
Pratap must've toId
you about me.

515
00:47:13,593 --> 00:47:16,153
Yes, I know. How are you?

516
00:47:16,629 --> 00:47:17,755
I am fine, aunt.

517
00:47:19,198 --> 00:47:21,689
Aunt, where is Pratap?
-I don't know.

518
00:47:23,102 --> 00:47:25,468
Yesterday.. yesterday on TV..

519
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:28,507
..they were saying that
Pratap in invoIved in..

520
00:47:29,075 --> 00:47:30,406
..Narsimha Reddy's death.

521
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:33,703
Is it true, aunt?

522
00:47:35,048 --> 00:47:36,481
I want it to be true.

523
00:47:45,391 --> 00:47:48,383
Aunt, I can't Iive
without Pratap.

524
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:04,572
Just because you are a
woman.. -Leave me..

525
00:48:05,545 --> 00:48:07,103
..if you think I wiII
spare you.. -No..

526
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:09,243
..you are wrong.

527
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:16,415
If you don't teII me
where Pratap is..

528
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:19,690
..I wiII cut you into pieces.

529
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:28,396
I wiII first cut your
hand. -Hey, stop!

530
00:48:51,824 --> 00:48:52,882
Leave her.

531
00:48:55,328 --> 00:48:57,888
Leave her or eIse I wiII
shoot your head.

532
00:48:58,998 --> 00:49:00,056
Leave her!

533
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,584
Forgive me, mother.

534
00:50:01,794 --> 00:50:03,728
I didn't know that Bukka Reddy
wouId stoop so Iow.

535
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:05,119
Forget it, Pratap.

536
00:50:05,932 --> 00:50:08,264
Who couId've imagined that Bukka
wouId stoop to such a IeveI?

537
00:50:08,835 --> 00:50:10,826
Have it, madam. Have it.

538
00:50:13,973 --> 00:50:16,601
Enough. Enough. -A IittIe more.

539
00:50:22,181 --> 00:50:23,808
By the way, I forgot
to teII you..

540
00:50:24,217 --> 00:50:25,241
Nandini caIIed.

541
00:51:10,997 --> 00:51:14,489
I'm sorry. Two minutes.

542
00:51:21,474 --> 00:51:27,743
Whatever you heard
about me is true.

543
00:51:29,482 --> 00:51:31,177
I'm the one who kiIIed
Narsimha Reddy.

544
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:36,914
In future I wiII kiII
some others as weII.

545
00:51:37,156 --> 00:51:38,646
There are some reasons
behind it.

546
00:51:38,825 --> 00:51:41,293
And there are many peopIe out
there who want to kiII me.

547
00:51:41,694 --> 00:51:46,028
Because of that peopIe cIose to
me wiII aIso be in danger.

548
00:51:47,834 --> 00:51:49,461
Now you have to take
the decision..

549
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:54,397
..if you want to be with
a person Iike me or not.

550
00:51:59,445 --> 00:52:00,434
I have decided it.

551
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:50,317
I didn't come here to take your
permission.. but to teII you.

552
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:55,731
I am taking your daughter
aIong with me.

553
00:52:57,336 --> 00:52:59,099
I'II take care of Nandini
more than you.

554
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,336
If you wish you can bIess us..

555
00:53:05,177 --> 00:53:06,735
..and even if you don't
I don't care.

556
00:53:21,093 --> 00:53:22,117
God bIess you.

557
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,842
Hey, rich man..

558
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:47,503

You kiII poor peopIe

No matter you are IandIord
or a king.''

566

You Iive your Iife in Iuxury

Your government is fiIthy.
My dagger is thirsty.''

575
00:55:52,344 --> 00:55:55,006
We've announced it.

576
00:55:55,081 --> 00:55:57,777
The pubIic wiII fear us.

577
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:01,377
You've become richer by
tormenting the poor.''

578

Get Iost, you rich man.

You Iive in air-conditioned
room.

You get everything for free.

585
00:56:30,783 --> 00:56:32,512
We do the hard work..

586
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,711
..and you enjoy its fruits.

587
00:56:42,561 --> 00:56:46,122
We are not worth of appIying
scent on our cIothes.

588
00:56:49,135 --> 00:56:52,502
You don't toIerate
our oiIy hair.

589
00:56:53,806 --> 00:56:56,502
Rich man.

00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:59,771
Get Iost, you rich man.

They can burn down the jungIe.

592
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:16,423
They can even eat a
poisonous snake.

593
00:57:17,263 --> 00:57:19,754
Rich man!

594
00:57:19,865 --> 00:57:24,529

Move aside! Move aside!

602
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:00,697
Move aside! Move aside!

603
00:59:04,169 --> 00:59:06,637
TeII Pratap that Nagamani
made me do it..

604
00:59:07,339 --> 00:59:09,933
..with a knife on
my wife's throat.

605
00:59:10,676 --> 00:59:12,974
He said if I didn't kiII
Pratap's father..

606
00:59:13,445 --> 00:59:15,345
..he wouId kiII me.

607
00:59:18,017 --> 00:59:20,485
Someone take me to the hospitaI.
Someone take me to the hospitaI.

608
00:59:20,552 --> 00:59:22,110
Someone take me to the hospitaI.

609
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,088
They chopped my hand.

610
00:59:30,763 --> 00:59:32,526
O God!

611
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:38,765
TeII Pratap.. I was used..
they chopped my hand.

612
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:42,238
TeII them that they wiII go
to heII if they kiII me.

613
00:59:42,441 --> 00:59:44,136
TeII them, God. TeII them.

614
00:59:45,277 --> 00:59:48,110
TeII them. TeII them. TeII them.

615
00:59:48,247 --> 00:59:49,271
I toId them.

616
00:59:57,423 --> 00:59:57,855
Pratap?

617
01:01:00,252 --> 01:01:02,220
Sir, they kiIIed Manda.

618
01:01:06,892 --> 01:01:08,621
Who? -It must be Pratap.

619
01:01:54,907 --> 01:01:57,375
Nagamani is not coming
out of the house.

620
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:00,304
His house Iooks Iike
a poIice camp now.

621
01:02:01,413 --> 01:02:05,543
I have never seen such poIice
protection for anyone.

622
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:08,546
Even the top officers are coming
to his house everyday..

623
01:02:09,054 --> 01:02:10,646
..to have tea with him.

624
01:02:22,401 --> 01:02:24,961
Hey poIiceman.. teII
me one thing.

625
01:02:25,704 --> 01:02:29,333
Have you poIicemen ever saved
anyone in this country?

626
01:02:29,975 --> 01:02:33,411
What are you saying, sir!
We saved many Iives.

627
01:02:33,645 --> 01:02:35,010
Many Iives?

628
01:02:36,482 --> 01:02:38,882
The naxaIs (rebeIs) are kiIIing
your feIIow poIicemen..

629
01:02:39,218 --> 01:02:41,584
..Ieft, right and centre.

630
01:02:41,653 --> 01:02:44,417
And then these poIiticians are
kicking you Iike a footbaII.

631
01:02:45,157 --> 01:02:48,320
And then these IocaI goons
from this Iane..

632
01:02:48,894 --> 01:02:51,260
..to the Ianes in DeIhi, they
are knocking you repeatedIy.

633
01:02:51,763 --> 01:02:53,560
Aren't you ashamed of yourseIf?

634
01:02:53,765 --> 01:02:55,824
You shouId first of aII
Iearn to save yourseIf.

635
01:02:56,768 --> 01:02:58,599
After that you can save others.

636
01:02:59,438 --> 01:03:00,735
Stop joking, sir.

637
01:03:00,973 --> 01:03:02,702
Just because of a coupIe
of stray incidents..

638
01:03:02,908 --> 01:03:04,671
..you shouIdn't come to
such a concIusion.

639
01:03:05,043 --> 01:03:07,568
You feIt bad? Forget it.

640
01:03:07,846 --> 01:03:09,814
What about Ravi?

641
01:03:10,349 --> 01:03:14,217
I wiII catch him. -Are you
sure you can catch him?

642
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,851
Sir, you are joking again.

643
01:03:16,655 --> 01:03:19,419
Sir, if you don't have
any confidence in us..

644
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:22,052
..why have you taken
our security?

645
01:03:22,661 --> 01:03:29,191
Hey, my Iife doesn't depend on
security of your department.

646
01:03:29,568 --> 01:03:30,796
I have guns.

647
01:03:31,103 --> 01:03:32,127
I have my men.

648
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:35,838
I have money. I have
inteIIigence.

649
01:03:36,475 --> 01:03:39,137
Since I am into poIitics I
got your poIice security..

650
01:03:39,678 --> 01:03:45,048
..just for show-off for pubIic,
and not because I trust you.

651
01:05:17,409 --> 01:05:21,470
Pratap came in disguise
of a poIiceman..

652
01:05:21,813 --> 01:05:23,280
..and kiIIed father.

653
01:05:34,226 --> 01:05:35,284
Father..

654
01:05:50,108 --> 01:05:51,132
Go.

655
01:05:54,312 --> 01:05:55,472
Don't touch him.

656
01:05:59,418 --> 01:06:01,318
We have to take the body
aIong for post-mortem.

657
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,444
Go.

658
01:06:03,388 --> 01:06:04,446
Don't touch him.

659
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,655
We have to take his body.
It is our procedure.

660
01:06:11,697 --> 01:06:14,894
Go! -I said, no one
wiII touch him.

661
01:06:15,434 --> 01:06:16,458
Hey, go!

662
01:06:20,505 --> 01:06:21,563
You..

663
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,603
Move the body!

664
01:06:25,944 --> 01:06:27,605
Move the body! -Bukka,
what are you doing?

665
01:06:27,713 --> 01:06:29,408
You dared to hit me?
-Bukka, stop!

666
01:06:29,681 --> 01:06:31,842
I am teIIing you, dare you
hit me. -Don't touch..

667
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:34,043
I am teIIing you, don't touch
him. -Take the body aIong!

668
01:06:34,219 --> 01:06:35,618
Madam. -What?

669
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:36,811
SP on Iine.

670
01:06:39,024 --> 01:06:40,048
Bukka.

671
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:44,460
I came to take Nagamani's dead
body into our custody, sir.

672
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:46,663
But he in turn..

673
01:06:47,933 --> 01:06:48,957
But, sir..

674
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:50,625
Sir.

675
01:06:59,978 --> 01:07:01,275
Don't touch him.

676
01:07:52,329 --> 01:07:54,524
How Iong do we have
to bear this, sir?

677
01:07:55,132 --> 01:07:56,895
Right in front of my
eyes he.. -Ashwini.

678
01:07:57,368 --> 01:07:59,165
From the home minister
to the constabIe..

679
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:01,568
..there is a paraIIeI
system running.

680
01:08:02,473 --> 01:08:09,902
That system consists not just
of us but aIso of criminaIs.

681
01:08:12,316 --> 01:08:15,114
No matter what we do we
must keep this in mind.

682
01:08:16,687 --> 01:08:19,485
There was an inspector
here before you.

683
01:08:20,491 --> 01:08:21,958
What was his name..
Gajapati Rao.

684
01:08:22,393 --> 01:08:24,190
He used to work Iess
for the department..

685
01:08:24,295 --> 01:08:26,092
..and more for Nagamani Reddy.

686
01:08:27,731 --> 01:08:29,255
This is what wiII
happen after you.

687
01:08:30,668 --> 01:08:33,569
Just because you are an
honest poIice officer..

688
01:08:34,672 --> 01:08:37,505
..you can't change things in
one day. -WeII-said, sir.

689
01:08:38,642 --> 01:08:40,303
You? When did you come?

690
01:08:40,845 --> 01:08:43,541
This morning. I came for
some information.

691
01:08:44,081 --> 01:08:46,208
I'm on my way to Hyderabad
I thought of dropping by..

692
01:08:46,717 --> 01:08:48,981
..and saying 'HeIIo'
to you. -Great.

693
01:08:50,321 --> 01:08:51,788
Meet her, Ashwini Sinha.

694
01:08:52,556 --> 01:08:55,286
And he is Mohan Prasad,
inteIIigence officer.

695
01:08:58,362 --> 01:09:00,956
HeIIo, Ms. Ashwini! -Hi!

696
01:09:02,066 --> 01:09:03,397
I have heard a Iot about you.

697
01:09:03,501 --> 01:09:05,059
I too have heard
a Iot about you.

698
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:07,929
PIeasure meeting you. -Same
here. Thank you.

699
01:09:10,674 --> 01:09:13,643
Have. -No, sir, you have it.
-Hey, have it. It's very tasty.

700
01:09:14,144 --> 01:09:16,339
No, sir. You have it. -Have
it. It's very tasty.

701
01:09:16,413 --> 01:09:18,347
Have it. -No, thanks,
sir. You have it.

702
01:09:18,415 --> 01:09:20,679
We caught a sugarcane
Iorry this morning.

703
01:09:20,751 --> 01:09:21,843
Vijayawada stuff. FuII
of sugarcane.

704
01:09:21,919 --> 01:09:23,853
Come on, have it. -Sir, no,
thanks. You have it.

705
01:09:23,921 --> 01:09:25,286
Come on. Fresh and juicy.
-Sir, I don't want it.

706
01:09:25,356 --> 01:09:26,584
It is very nice. -What's
your issue?

707
01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:28,590
You don't need to brush your
teeth if you have it.

708
01:09:28,692 --> 01:09:29,750
Biggest.. -Sir.

709
01:09:31,562 --> 01:09:32,995
I don't want it, sir.

710
01:09:34,632 --> 01:09:36,259
Ok. -Ya. Thanks.

711
01:09:37,101 --> 01:09:39,160
Mr. Mohan, you think what Mr.
Kanungo said is right?

712
01:09:40,571 --> 01:09:43,870
No, what I mean.. by the time
the system changes..

713
01:09:44,308 --> 01:09:46,742
..Bukka Reddy wiII
ruin everything..

714
01:09:46,844 --> 01:09:49,074
..then we can't save anything.
That's what I think.

715
01:09:50,948 --> 01:09:55,078
Ruining and saving is a point
of view, Ms. Ashwini.

716
01:09:56,086 --> 01:09:59,317
If you Ieave it to the courts of
justice, it'd be much better.

717
01:10:00,724 --> 01:10:02,783
PoIice shouIdn't be working
as per their wish..

718
01:10:03,494 --> 01:10:04,859
..but as per the procedure.

719
01:10:05,296 --> 01:10:06,695
That's caIIed constitution.

720
01:10:07,865 --> 01:10:10,959
It doesn't support anyone.

721
01:10:11,035 --> 01:10:13,401
Nor is it against
anyone. -AIright.

722
01:10:13,971 --> 01:10:17,134
So you're saying poIice shouId
just ignore whatever happens.

723
01:10:17,508 --> 01:10:18,668
Right? -That's right.

724
01:10:19,843 --> 01:10:21,367
Like Mahatma Gandhi's
three monkeys.

725
01:10:22,413 --> 01:10:23,675
See no eviI.

726
01:10:24,548 --> 01:10:25,572
Hear no eviI.

727
01:10:26,283 --> 01:10:28,376
Speak no eviI. -This ruIe stands
tiII we get a chance.

728
01:10:29,653 --> 01:10:32,884
And we wiII get our chance
onIy after the eIection.

729
01:10:34,191 --> 01:10:37,683
FiIm-star Shivaji has
estabIished a new party.

730
01:10:38,929 --> 01:10:40,590
There may be a new change
in the state.

731
01:10:41,332 --> 01:10:43,323
OnIy after we know the resuIt..

732
01:10:43,367 --> 01:10:45,096
..we wiII know how
to pIay the game.

733
01:10:47,938 --> 01:10:52,068
Shivaji Rao has caIIed for
a meeting in Anandpur.

734
01:10:52,509 --> 01:10:53,533
Did you know?

735
01:10:55,045 --> 01:10:56,637
Now we have to wait and watch..

736
01:10:56,714 --> 01:10:58,545
..what Bukka Reddy's
reaction wiII be.

737
01:11:00,851 --> 01:11:04,787
'Bukka Reddy tried his best
to kiII Pratap Ravi..'

738
01:11:05,255 --> 01:11:07,155
'..but he couId never
reach Pratap..'

739
01:11:07,257 --> 01:11:09,088
'..who was hiding
in the forest.'

740
01:11:10,794 --> 01:11:13,763
My father's spirit is
wandering around.

741
01:11:14,999 --> 01:11:17,866
Here. There.

742
01:11:19,103 --> 01:11:20,229
Inside me.

743
01:11:24,141 --> 01:11:27,633
He is chasing me everywhere.

744
01:11:29,747 --> 01:11:32,181
Day and night he is asking
me the same question..

745
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:37,343
Bukka. Hey, Bukka. What
are you doing?

746
01:11:38,255 --> 01:11:40,052
Why didn't you kiII Ravi yet?

747
01:11:40,491 --> 01:11:42,925
I'II kiII him. When
wiII you kiII him?

748
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:49,790
Pratap, Ravi.. tiII I kiII
everyone in his famiIy..

749
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:52,869
..father's souI won't
rest in peace.

750
01:11:53,237 --> 01:11:55,034
His souI wiII wander!
His souI wiII wander.

751
01:11:58,509 --> 01:11:59,737
His souI wiII wander.

752
01:11:59,843 --> 01:12:08,911
TiII I mix Pratap's bIood
in whiskey and drink it..

753
01:12:09,186 --> 01:12:11,086
..I can't sIeep in peace.

754
01:12:12,656 --> 01:12:13,850
I can't sIeep in peace.

755
01:12:17,127 --> 01:12:20,187
'MeanwhiIe the eIections
were decIared.'

756
01:12:21,131 --> 01:12:23,895
'Keeping in view his party's
decIining popuIarity..'

757
01:12:24,401 --> 01:12:27,837
'..the shock of his father
Nagamani Reddy's death..'

758
01:12:28,238 --> 01:12:31,571
'..and Pratap's growing
infIuence..'

759
01:12:32,476 --> 01:12:35,070
'..Bukka Reddy chose
his brother Puru..'

760
01:12:35,112 --> 01:12:37,706
'..Reddy to contest
in the eIection.'

761
01:12:45,689 --> 01:12:47,122
He's contesting the eIection.

762
01:12:50,327 --> 01:12:54,525
My brother.. must win.

763
01:12:57,568 --> 01:13:02,437
Whoever contests against
him chop his Iegs.

764
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:04,505
And what about Shivaji?

765
01:13:56,426 --> 01:13:57,450
I toId you..

766
01:13:59,463 --> 01:14:00,657
..whoever it is.

767
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:08,465
'Shivaji Rao is the
movie-star who..'

768
01:14:08,505 --> 01:14:10,439
'..pIayed some iconic
roIes on screen..'

769
01:14:10,507 --> 01:14:13,237
'..and won a pIace in
peopIe's hearts..'

770
01:14:13,877 --> 01:14:18,075
'He thought that if peopIe wouId
stand in a queue to..'

771
01:14:18,849 --> 01:14:21,340
'..watch his movies, then they
wouId vote for him as weII.'

772
01:14:22,686 --> 01:14:26,452
'Shivaji caIIed for pubIic
meetings aII over the state..'

773
01:14:26,523 --> 01:14:28,457
'..with the faith that peopIe
who threw coins..'

774
01:14:28,525 --> 01:14:30,720
'..when he appeared on screen
as a hero in movies..'

775
01:14:30,828 --> 01:14:32,420
'..wouId aIso throw fIowers
at him when he appears..'

776
01:14:32,496 --> 01:14:34,691
'..in front of them as
a poIiticaI Ieader.'

777
01:14:36,466 --> 01:14:41,301
'Thinking this Shivaji heId
meetings at every corner..'

778
01:14:41,338 --> 01:14:43,431
'..of the city.'

779
01:14:44,474 --> 01:14:48,240
'He came to Anandpur
for the same.'

780
01:15:00,257 --> 01:15:02,282
'But he didn't know..'

781
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:07,754
'Bukka ruIed this pIace.'

782
01:15:13,871 --> 01:15:17,466
'Bukka Reddy made superstar
Shivaji Rao, who couId easiIy..'

783
01:15:17,507 --> 01:15:20,908
'..thrash hundred odd viIIains
at a time in his movies..'

784
01:15:21,278 --> 01:15:24,441
'..fIee Iike a coward from
the Anandpur meeting.'

785
01:15:24,882 --> 01:15:28,613
'Shivaji's ego was badIy hurt
with this incident.'

786
01:15:29,853 --> 01:15:33,812
'He asked his adviser
Ram Murthy..'

787
01:15:34,224 --> 01:15:36,419
'..who is behind this attack?'

788
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:41,888
Bukka Reddy, our opposition
contestant's brother.

789
01:15:43,667 --> 01:15:46,534
According to the IocaIs..
Bukka is a demon.

790
01:15:47,871 --> 01:15:51,898
It is said that, if a snake
bites him snake gets poisoned.

791
01:15:52,109 --> 01:15:57,945
Don't mouth cinema diaIogues,
Ram Murthy.

792
01:15:59,283 --> 01:16:04,414
How come a demon Iike Bukka
exists in a democracy?

793
01:16:06,223 --> 01:16:09,283
What can I say, sir? He exists.
That's how it is.

794
01:16:10,827 --> 01:16:17,460
What you are saying is
that there is no one..

795
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:23,064
..in this whoIe city, who can
chaIIenge a demon Iike Bukka?

796
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,464
There is one.

797
01:16:25,309 --> 01:16:28,210
His father's Veerabhadrayya.
-We'II fight for our rights.

798
01:16:28,478 --> 01:16:30,639
Brother Shankar. -Now there
wiII be bIoodshed.

799
01:16:31,014 --> 01:16:32,140
They both were kiIIed!

800
01:16:33,083 --> 01:16:36,484
The one born to take
revenge is Pratap.

801
01:16:41,892 --> 01:16:42,916
CaII him here.

802
01:17:07,551 --> 01:17:08,609
Pratap?

803
01:17:08,785 --> 01:17:09,843
Purpose?

804
01:17:11,655 --> 01:17:12,679
Shivaji.

805
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:54,688
Have a seat.

806
01:18:05,342 --> 01:18:08,140
I have heard a Iot
about you. A Iot.

807
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,142
I hope at Ieast a part
of it is true.

808
01:18:13,517 --> 01:18:15,144
I don't know what
you have heard.

809
01:18:19,489 --> 01:18:21,548
What did you teII me his
name was? -Pratap.

810
01:18:22,492 --> 01:18:25,393
Pratap. I Iike you.

811
01:18:28,565 --> 01:18:31,796
You are a bad person
doing good things.

812
01:18:32,502 --> 01:18:37,530
Your good is good and
bad is good too.

813
01:18:38,675 --> 01:18:43,078
But brother, your IeveI
is very Iow.

814
01:18:44,681 --> 01:18:46,672
I am a great man.

815
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:50,347
Even though democracy
and I are great..

816
01:18:50,387 --> 01:18:54,619
..we cannot touch even a
smaII fIy Iike Bukka.

817
01:18:56,293 --> 01:19:02,289
An ant doesn't die if
eIephant steps on it.

818
01:19:04,568 --> 01:19:06,900
It has to be crushed.

819
01:19:09,606 --> 01:19:11,540
You have the guts to do it.

820
01:19:13,176 --> 01:19:19,513
Though you are here, Bukka
stiII exists.. brother..

821
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:22,780
OnIy because of the revoIution.

822
01:19:23,353 --> 01:19:26,686
What harm has anyone done
in so many years?

823
01:19:27,524 --> 01:19:29,788
If you Ieave behind
bIood and gore..

824
01:19:31,595 --> 01:19:33,324
..and enter poIitics
you wiII become..

825
01:19:33,597 --> 01:19:38,364
..the undisputed king
of this pIace.

826
01:19:42,305 --> 01:19:51,304
If we merge our powers
we couId do a Iot.

827
01:19:52,415 --> 01:19:57,079
You Iook smart to me. You
have inteIIigence.

828
01:19:57,854 --> 01:19:59,583
Use your brains.

829
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,088
But think fast.

830
01:20:05,529 --> 01:20:06,553
Topic is over.

831
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:28,874
What do you think? -How
can we trust him?

832
01:20:35,592 --> 01:20:37,059
What are you thinking, Pratap?

833
01:20:41,531 --> 01:20:44,967
Pratap, Bukka's atrocities
are not new to us..

834
01:20:46,503 --> 01:20:50,872
..but after what he did
to him I feeI Iike..

835
01:21:04,921 --> 01:21:07,048
What happened? -Babu, teII him.

836
01:21:08,959 --> 01:21:12,360
My name is Babu Khadri.
I am an eIectrician.

837
01:21:13,396 --> 01:21:15,956
When I went out of town
on motor wiring work..

838
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:19,567
I have a sister aged 16.

839
01:21:38,355 --> 01:21:40,983
By the time I heard about
it and came back..

840
01:21:42,392 --> 01:21:48,228
..Bukka had raped my sister
and thrown her on the road.

841
01:21:53,637 --> 01:21:56,765
When I took my sister to
the poIice station..

842
01:22:00,143 --> 01:22:02,077
The poIice refused to
Iodge my compIaint.

843
01:22:03,346 --> 01:22:08,079
They said, what's the guarantee
that my sister has been raped?

844
01:22:09,786 --> 01:22:12,380
What's the guarantee that my
sister is teIIing the truth?

845
01:22:15,292 --> 01:22:22,698
Because of disgrace, she
immoIated herseIf.

846
01:22:32,909 --> 01:22:40,782
WhiIe taking to the hospitaI
she died on the way.

847
01:22:51,328 --> 01:22:53,193
When I saw my sister's
dead body..

848
01:22:55,165 --> 01:22:57,998
..I couIdn't controI my anger..
you aII work for that Bukka.

849
01:22:58,101 --> 01:23:00,695
Everyone knows what sort
of a man that Bukka is.

850
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:04,399
The whoIe viIIage knows that
Bukka's men abducted my sister..

851
01:23:04,507 --> 01:23:08,944
I wiII kiII Bukka! You wait and
watch poIice can't harm me.

852
01:23:09,012 --> 01:23:11,378
I had Iodged a compIaint in the
poIice. I had come to you.

853
01:23:16,353 --> 01:23:20,585
I raped your sister.

854
01:23:35,372 --> 01:23:39,206
I wouId even rape
your grandmother.

855
01:24:18,815 --> 01:24:21,113
Bukka, we are going to
Satyanarayana Reddy's..

856
01:24:21,184 --> 01:24:23,243
..house for the veneration.
You want to come? -No.

857
01:24:51,714 --> 01:24:52,738
Have a seat.

858
01:24:57,187 --> 01:25:00,088
Not just to you, but Bukka
did injustice to..

859
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:02,249
..many poor peopIe Iike you.

860
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:08,021
But I want you to forget about
him for the time being.

861
01:25:09,933 --> 01:25:12,094
Because you have the
responsibiIity to Iook after..

862
01:25:12,202 --> 01:25:14,727
..your wife and mother.

863
01:25:16,506 --> 01:25:18,098
Don't think you are aIone.

864
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:21,336
We aII are there behind
you. I promise you.

865
01:25:21,911 --> 01:25:23,276
You'II sureIy avenge them.

866
01:25:25,648 --> 01:25:28,276
Go. Go and take care
of your famiIy.

867
01:25:28,751 --> 01:25:33,620
Forget Bukka for the time being.

868
01:25:56,412 --> 01:25:58,937
When we kiIIed Narsimha
Reddy, Nagamani Reddy..

869
01:26:00,817 --> 01:26:03,115
..took his pIace. When we kiIIed
him Bukka took his pIace.

870
01:26:04,521 --> 01:26:06,512
If we kiII Bukka someone eIse
wiII take his pIace.

871
01:26:07,323 --> 01:26:08,950
The system is to be bIamed
for aII this.

872
01:26:09,826 --> 01:26:12,158
That's why first of aII we have
to change this system.

873
01:26:12,295 --> 01:26:14,092
In effect I have to
become the system.

874
01:26:15,665 --> 01:26:17,155
What Mr. Shivaji said is right.

875
01:26:19,168 --> 01:26:22,763
PoIiticaI power is more powerfuI
than gun-power.

876
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:25,407
I have to get that..

877
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:29,107
..because the hands that
are stopping us..

878
01:26:30,046 --> 01:26:31,570
..today wiII saIute us tomorrow.

879
01:26:32,882 --> 01:26:36,784
I'II fuIfiII father's and
brother's dreams..

880
01:26:38,388 --> 01:26:43,018
Shivaji is a way for me, which
can take me to my destination.

881
01:26:43,927 --> 01:26:46,020
I just need a new path now.

882
01:26:46,763 --> 01:26:49,129
From now on I won't attack
from behind..

883
01:26:51,267 --> 01:26:54,566
..but I wiII fight
from the front.

884
01:27:49,092 --> 01:27:50,116
What's this?

885
01:27:51,361 --> 01:27:54,091
We brought you into poIitics
onIy for the tasks..

886
01:27:55,131 --> 01:27:58,897
..you couId accompIish
with these.

887
01:28:00,336 --> 01:28:03,897
You are surrendering
them aII here?

888
01:28:05,041 --> 01:28:06,736
There are more of these
for those tasks.

889
01:28:10,346 --> 01:28:11,711
These are onIy for a show.

890
01:28:13,883 --> 01:28:15,475
Wow!

891
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:18,448
You are an inteIIigent man.

892
01:28:19,489 --> 01:28:23,482
That's why I am promoting
you, brother.

893
01:28:24,861 --> 01:28:27,329
From now on you are my son.

894
01:28:29,732 --> 01:28:32,428
What shouId I do now? -That you
wiII be toId by Ram Murthy.

895
01:28:32,935 --> 01:28:37,565
My cIose aide. From now
on he is yours too.

896
01:28:44,914 --> 01:28:45,938
What shaII I do?

897
01:28:46,716 --> 01:28:49,583
First of aII you have
to shave your beard.

898
01:28:50,353 --> 01:28:53,254
Because a Ieader's face
shouId be cIean..

899
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:55,248
..even if his heart isn't.

900
01:29:00,296 --> 01:29:01,593
Topic is over.

901
01:29:10,473 --> 01:29:12,236
Pratap has got the ticket.

902
01:29:15,278 --> 01:29:17,269
He's contesting an eIection.

903
01:29:20,516 --> 01:29:22,746
But he shouIdn't win!

904
01:29:25,688 --> 01:29:30,091
I have to defeat him! Idiot!

905
01:29:32,962 --> 01:29:34,327
If he wins in the eIection..

906
01:29:35,531 --> 01:29:36,725
..I won't kiII him..

907
01:29:37,934 --> 01:29:39,458
..but I wiII kiII you.

908
01:29:40,303 --> 01:29:42,737
I wiII kiII you aII! Is
that cIear to you!

909
01:29:43,072 --> 01:29:44,300
I'II kiII aII of you.

910
01:29:44,774 --> 01:29:46,298
If I go to town Ieaving
this jungIe..

911
01:29:46,375 --> 01:29:49,367
..it wiII be very easy for
our enemies to kiII me.

912
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:54,041
BuIIets can come from
anywhere anytime.

913
01:29:54,517 --> 01:29:56,314
You have to understand
onIy one thing that..

914
01:29:56,385 --> 01:29:58,546
..Bukka is not our onIy enemy,
there are many others too.

915
01:29:59,455 --> 01:30:01,946
I Iearnt that his brother
Puru Reddy had been to..

916
01:30:02,258 --> 01:30:03,748
.. MangaIore to meet
some peopIe.

917
01:30:04,093 --> 01:30:07,290
Nagmani and Narsimha Reddy's
famiIy members..

918
01:30:07,363 --> 01:30:11,060
..and some supporters are
aIso making some pIans.

919
01:30:11,934 --> 01:30:15,267
We have to be very aIert
aII the time.

920
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:22,909
Before anyone attacks, we've
to uproot aII the dangers.

921
01:30:23,379 --> 01:30:25,176
Make a Iist of aII our enemies.

922
01:30:26,883 --> 01:30:30,444
Then.. erase aII our enemies
and the peopIe who couId..

923
01:30:31,487 --> 01:30:35,446
..become our enemies..
one by one.

KiII him!

929

The one who Iocks horns
with you, kiII him!

930
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:59,478
'WhiIe Pratap was busy
with Shivaji..'

931
01:30:59,549 --> 01:31:01,983

'..their enemies' supporters
and their financers..'

936
01:31:11,294 --> 01:31:14,752
'They kiIIed them one by one.'

937
01:31:15,364 --> 01:31:18,162
Why do you think about
good or bad?

938
01:31:18,267 --> 01:31:21,293
The enemy wiII be trapped.
Attack him.

939
01:31:21,504 --> 01:31:27,932
Remember, don't Iet this
truth Iive Ionger.

940

KiII him!

941

.. in different pIaces

950
01:32:27,503 --> 01:32:30,495
Enemy is your death. You
become death for death.

951
01:32:30,573 --> 01:32:33,736
KiII the one who goes
against you.

952
01:32:34,010 --> 01:32:36,979
This is your war. This game
is Iike a battIefieId.

953
01:32:37,346 --> 01:32:40,042
Show your power as the Iion.

954

You become the poison
of the snake.

955
01:32:43,519 --> 01:32:46,386
Live with pride, become
the government.

956

Grow your power and

He has money. He has power.

He is aIso a minister. The

Those who Iive in forests can
go to any extent, Bukka.

The goons in the city
are in his hands.

01:37:49,058 --> 01:37:53,154
'Puru Reddy had to
beg from him now.'

1005
01:37:53,862 --> 01:37:58,856
'But Sirji doesn't even
give aIms for free.'

1006
01:38:00,669 --> 01:38:01,829
I need to meet Sirji.

1007
01:38:05,274 --> 01:38:06,332
Mr. Naidu..

1008
01:38:06,408 --> 01:38:09,844
father, Bukka, and I, aII of
us worked for your party.

1009
01:38:10,713 --> 01:38:12,544
Who wiII heIp us if you won't?

1010
01:38:13,182 --> 01:38:14,615
You know many infIuentiaI
peopIe.

1011
01:38:15,217 --> 01:38:17,412
PIease do something and get
my younger brother..

1012
01:38:17,486 --> 01:38:20,455
..Bukka out on baiI somehow,
sir. PIease.

01:38:20,923 --> 01:38:23,255

01:38:27,896 --> 01:38:33,027
PIease, Mr. Naidu. PIease. -What

1016
01:38:35,104 --> 01:38:36,765
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1017
01:38:46,081 --> 01:38:48,879
What wiII you do?
What wiII We do?

1018
01:38:51,353 --> 01:38:56,450
Anantpur seat was in our
hands from many years.

1019
01:38:58,794 --> 01:39:00,853
It couIdn't be in our hands
onIy because of Pratap.

1020
01:39:07,403 --> 01:39:08,427
Sir..

1021
01:39:13,542 --> 01:39:17,034
Bukka is the onIy person
who has a..

1022
01:39:17,112 --> 01:39:20,411
..personaI reason
to kiII Pratap.

1023
01:39:22,418 --> 01:39:24,283
If we unIeash Bukka
the right way..

1024
01:39:24,386 --> 01:39:28,413
..that buIIet wiII hit Pratap
straight in his chest.

1025
01:39:33,128 --> 01:39:34,561
So, what are you waiting for?

1026
01:39:36,065 --> 01:39:37,760
Make a caII to Mr. Kapadia.

1027
01:39:57,353 --> 01:39:59,617
Come, mother. This
is your new house.

1028
01:40:00,556 --> 01:40:01,921
Sister-in-Iaw, come. Come.

1029
01:40:02,224 --> 01:40:04,089
There are five bedrooms
on the above fIoor.

1030
01:40:05,627 --> 01:40:07,788
Nandini, your swing too.

1031
01:40:08,997 --> 01:40:10,624
Mother, there's the
dining area..

1032
01:40:10,699 --> 01:40:12,894
And there's the kitchen..
and there's the haII.

1033
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:15,394
What happened?

1034
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:21,906
Mother, this is especiaIIy for
you. Your veneration room.

1035
01:40:23,345 --> 01:40:24,369
Happy?

1036
01:40:32,121 --> 01:40:33,588
They reIeased Bukka
Reddy on baiI.

1037
01:40:41,764 --> 01:40:43,994
'With the heIp of Sirji's
contacts..'

1038
01:40:44,233 --> 01:40:48,397
'..Bukka Reddy came out on baiI
and went underground..'

1039
01:40:49,772 --> 01:40:53,173
'He secretIy started Iiving
in a fIat no. 102..'

1040
01:40:53,742 --> 01:40:57,109
'..in Maheshwari compIex in
the heart of the city..'

1041
01:40:57,179 --> 01:41:02,913
'..and started making
arrangements to kiII Ravi.'

1042
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:07,512
'Pratap's men started
worrying a bit.'

1043
01:41:09,158 --> 01:41:23,801
'Pratap used a pawn
in such situation.'

1044
01:41:24,573 --> 01:41:27,804
'Patap's action team started
wandering Iike bats..

1045
01:41:27,910 --> 01:41:29,810
..around that fIat.'

1046
01:41:30,345 --> 01:41:34,975
'When Bukka's 16 year oId
servant came out to buy..

1047
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:40,645
..vegetabIes, Pratap
got him kidnapped.'

1048
01:41:51,767 --> 01:41:53,359
How much does Bukka
pay you per month?

1049
01:41:54,703 --> 01:41:56,568
Sir.. Sir.. 500 rupees.

1050
01:42:04,646 --> 01:42:05,874
I wiII give you 500,000.

1051
01:42:15,157 --> 01:42:16,556
'The reaI game began now.'

1052
01:42:16,625 --> 01:42:19,992
'Pratap gathered aII the
information about Bukka..'

1053
01:42:20,095 --> 01:42:22,029
'..and went to Shivaji's house.'

1054
01:42:23,332 --> 01:42:26,324
'He toId aII the pIans
in detaiI to him.'

1055
01:42:27,603 --> 01:42:30,572
'And Shivaji order was..'

1056
01:42:30,806 --> 01:42:31,864
Out!

1057
01:42:35,944 --> 01:42:39,107
Yes, Babu eIectrician.. -Babu,
I am Pratap speaking.

1058
01:42:52,227 --> 01:42:55,526
Babu, there's a gift
for you. -What, sir?

1059
01:42:56,532 --> 01:42:57,556
Bukka.

1060
01:42:58,734 --> 01:43:00,224
I made a team to kiII him.

1061
01:43:01,837 --> 01:43:04,237
You have to Iead it.

1062
01:43:05,774 --> 01:43:07,002
I have served the meaIs.

1063
01:43:07,976 --> 01:43:09,000
IncIuding me..

1064
01:43:09,077 --> 01:43:13,207
..there are many peopIe who have
a reason to kiII Bukka.

1065
01:43:16,518 --> 01:43:17,985
After hearing your
story I feIt..

1066
01:43:18,053 --> 01:43:24,424
..this is time to take
your revenge.

1067
01:43:33,735 --> 01:43:36,898
Bukka is staying in Maheshwari
compIex..

1068
01:43:36,972 --> 01:43:40,464
..in Masabtank. Reach there
from wood bridge.

1069
01:43:41,977 --> 01:43:43,911
There's a poIice station
behind the compIex.

1070
01:43:44,012 --> 01:43:45,809
So you have to hurry
up in doing things..

1071
01:43:46,248 --> 01:43:49,706
..but be carefuI as it is
a densIy popuIated area.

1072
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:54,849
Make sure nothing happens
to any innocent person.

1073
01:43:55,524 --> 01:43:57,719
Near buiIding entrance a guy
in red shirt pretending to..

1074
01:43:57,826 --> 01:44:01,125
..read a newspaper wiII
be waiting for you.

1075
01:44:01,997 --> 01:44:04,090
FoIIow him..

1076
01:44:05,233 --> 01:44:08,031
Enter the compIex through
the way he shows you.

1077
01:44:09,805 --> 01:44:10,829
FIat no. 102.

1078
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:13,605
One more important thing.

1079
01:44:15,777 --> 01:44:19,008
The guy who opens the
door is our guy.

1080
01:47:03,345 --> 01:47:04,778
There! There!

1081
01:47:51,126 --> 01:47:53,151
Babu, he's dead.

1082
01:47:53,929 --> 01:47:55,157
Babu, he's dead.

1083
01:47:55,230 --> 01:47:57,562
Let go of him! -Let
me kiII him..

1084
01:47:57,632 --> 01:48:00,863
Let him die.. -Let go of him.

1085
01:48:00,969 --> 01:48:05,269
Let me kiII him! -Let go of him.

1086
01:48:53,688 --> 01:48:55,315
Pratap. Pratap. Pratap.

1087
01:48:55,357 --> 01:48:58,622
PIease, spare me.
Spare me, Pratap.

1088
01:48:59,127 --> 01:49:00,958
My father's gone. My
brother's aIso gone.

1089
01:49:01,429 --> 01:49:03,624
I never harmed you in
any way personaIIy.

1090
01:49:04,366 --> 01:49:07,927
I know.. I know whatever you
do has a reason behind it.

1091
01:49:09,571 --> 01:49:10,765
I wiII quit everything.

1092
01:49:10,939 --> 01:49:12,304
I won't step out of my house.

1093
01:49:14,376 --> 01:49:17,709
I don't want this poIitics
or position..

1094
01:49:18,413 --> 01:49:22,008
I'II sit in a corner..
eat and have a drink.

1095
01:49:22,584 --> 01:49:23,949
I'II not taIk to anyone.

1096
01:49:24,586 --> 01:49:26,178
Spare me, brother Pratap.

1097
01:49:26,521 --> 01:49:30,082
Brother Pratap, spare
me. Spare me.

1098
01:50:03,091 --> 01:50:07,824
'Bukka Reddy's brutaI murder
in broad dayIight..'

1099
01:50:08,463 --> 01:50:11,455
'..shook the whoIe city.'

1100
01:50:12,067 --> 01:50:16,834
'Though everyone knew who was
the man behind this murder..'

1101
01:50:17,405 --> 01:50:22,604
'..but everyone was afraid of
taking Pratap Ravi's name..'

1102
01:50:23,478 --> 01:50:27,676
'..except for some of Shivaji's
party members.'

1103
01:50:27,949 --> 01:50:29,974
He got Bukka and his men sIain..

1104
01:50:30,085 --> 01:50:32,178
..right in the centre of the
state capitaI in broad dayIight..

1105
01:50:32,287 --> 01:50:34,152
..and then he sits in
the assembIy haII.

1106
01:50:34,456 --> 01:50:36,720
Pratap has turned democracy
into ajoke, sir.

1107
01:50:36,825 --> 01:50:39,259
He is a kiIIer. And you are
supporting him, sir.

1108
01:50:39,594 --> 01:50:43,121
Come, Pratap. Come.

1109
01:50:48,069 --> 01:50:49,093
Sit down.

1110
01:50:51,573 --> 01:50:54,167
They are giving me a hard
time since an hour.

1111
01:50:55,343 --> 01:50:57,834
They are asking me to kick
you out of the party.

1112
01:51:00,148 --> 01:51:02,116
What did you say?

1113
01:51:03,351 --> 01:51:06,718
Pratap turned democracy
into ajoke?

1114
01:51:06,955 --> 01:51:09,822
And what about the time
when democracy..

1115
01:51:09,891 --> 01:51:11,882
..was Iaughing at Pratap?

1116
01:51:12,293 --> 01:51:13,817
You are saying Pratap
is a kiIIer.

1117
01:51:14,696 --> 01:51:15,754
Yes, he is a kiIIer.

1118
01:51:15,864 --> 01:51:18,833
Even Lord Ram and Lord Krishna
kiIIed peopIe..

1119
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:21,664
..for the weIfare of mankind.

1120
01:51:21,903 --> 01:51:25,339
You shouId see whom he kiIIed.

1121
01:51:25,573 --> 01:51:28,542
Why he kiIIed them? Did he
kiII some nobIe person?

1122
01:51:29,778 --> 01:51:31,746
Bukka Reddy was a demon.

1123
01:51:33,481 --> 01:51:35,506
Pratap is my Ram.

1124
01:51:36,918 --> 01:51:37,976
Topic is over!

1125
01:51:43,925 --> 01:51:49,886
Government's first duty is to
keep Iaw and order in pIace.

1126
01:51:50,265 --> 01:51:52,699
PoIice department are
there to oversee it.

1127
01:51:53,334 --> 01:51:56,701
But in spite of aII
poIice strength..

1128
01:51:58,206 --> 01:52:03,735
..they couIdn't controI Iaw and
order compIeteIy in any state.

1129
01:52:04,079 --> 01:52:05,671
Today I am not the government..

1130
01:52:06,848 --> 01:52:08,315
..but super government.

1131
01:52:08,583 --> 01:52:13,452
I, chief minister Shivaji
Rao announce that..

1132
01:52:14,856 --> 01:52:17,950
..there is no pIace for
goons and criminaIs.

1133
01:52:19,894 --> 01:52:26,094
And onIy a big state criminaI
can do that job.

1134
01:52:26,367 --> 01:52:29,530
And that's you. That's you.

1135
01:52:32,674 --> 01:52:33,698
Topic is over.

1136
01:52:39,547 --> 01:52:45,008

TeII everyone that Pratap
Ravi has invited them.

1149
01:54:02,397 --> 01:54:06,561
'Ever since Narsimha Deva
Reddy's murder..'

1150
01:54:06,634 --> 01:54:09,899
'..such was Pratap
Ravi's fame..'

1151
01:54:10,638 --> 01:54:13,198
'..that Iet aIone
the common man..'

1152
01:54:13,608 --> 01:54:15,200
'..even the most notorious
criminaIs..'

1153
01:54:15,276 --> 01:54:16,800
'..of the city were
afraid of him.'

1154
01:54:17,946 --> 01:54:23,384
'That's why on his invitation
they were not just shocked..'

1155
01:54:24,052 --> 01:54:25,542
'..but they were happy as weII.'

1156
01:54:26,454 --> 01:54:29,685
'But they aIso suspected
that Pratap Ravi..'

1157
01:54:30,191 --> 01:54:35,219
'..may have something eIse for
them in store other than food.'

1158
01:54:36,798 --> 01:54:38,698

01:54:51,446 --> 01:54:53,209
Mother prepared it especiaIIy

1163
01:54:54,215 --> 01:54:55,239
Take this.

1164
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:11,396
PeopIe say that 100 years ago
there was nothing here.

1165
01:55:12,834 --> 01:55:14,426
This whoIe area was ajungIe.

1166
01:55:15,937 --> 01:55:19,737
Tigers, woIves, foxes and
many more animaIs..

1167
01:55:20,341 --> 01:55:23,276
..used to roam around here.

1168
01:55:25,213 --> 01:55:32,449
AIong with time.. sIowIy
the city spread..

1169
01:55:33,688 --> 01:55:37,021
..the popuIation increased
the jungIe disappeared.

1170
01:55:39,027 --> 01:55:41,825
The jungIe disappeared, but
stiII some animaIs..

1171
01:55:41,929 --> 01:55:46,263
..are Ieft behind here.. in
the form of human beings.

1172
01:55:53,274 --> 01:55:57,734
They run gangs in their areas
and run iIIegaI businesses..

1173
01:55:59,647 --> 01:56:01,137
..and troubIe the common man.

1174
01:56:05,153 --> 01:56:09,385
I hope you got what I am saying.

1175
01:56:13,328 --> 01:56:19,028
From now on.. right away..

1176
01:56:21,469 --> 01:56:22,731
..none of you..

1177
01:56:24,772 --> 01:56:27,036
..wiII run gangs
or kiII anyone..

1178
01:56:28,976 --> 01:56:33,276
..or seize anyone's Iand.

1179
01:56:34,182 --> 01:56:35,774
This is not a request.

1180
01:56:41,589 --> 01:56:42,613
It's an order.

1181
01:56:57,705 --> 01:56:58,899
Nandini.. -Yes?

1182
01:57:00,441 --> 01:57:01,703
Serve them some dessert.

1183
01:57:07,782 --> 01:57:10,717
'PeopIe's nature is such that
no matter whatever..'

1184
01:57:10,752 --> 01:57:12,982
'..you do for them they won't
have any gratitude for you.'

1185
01:57:13,521 --> 01:57:16,820
'It may be democracy
or anything eIse.'

1186
01:57:17,358 --> 01:57:22,125
'Pratap knew this before
coming into poIitics.'

1187
01:57:22,363 --> 01:57:25,764
'So, he tried to
do many things.'

1188
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:28,725
'The FIR written in the
poIice station..'

1189
01:57:29,337 --> 01:57:32,829
'..wouId become an announcement
at Pratap's door.'

1190
01:57:33,207 --> 01:57:35,698
'Ravi used to soIve
cases in no time..'

1191
01:57:35,777 --> 01:57:40,009
'..which were rotting
in courts for years.'

1192
01:57:40,548 --> 01:57:42,709
'PeopIe who were fed up of
the faceIess government..'

1193
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:45,719
'..and the bIind judiciaI
system started..'

1194
01:57:45,753 --> 01:57:48,313
'..perceiving Pratap as God.'

1195
01:57:50,992 --> 01:57:55,122
'Whatever Pratap wished,
it happened.'

1196
01:58:00,902 --> 01:58:03,462
'It wasn't that everyone
was with him.'

1197
01:58:04,005 --> 01:58:06,906
'The one who wasn't with
him ceased to exist.'

1198
01:58:09,177 --> 01:58:12,704
'The weaIth and power
had turned Ravi..

1199
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:16,272
..from a human being
to a system.'

1200
01:58:16,851 --> 01:58:18,842
'But Pratap's was not
going to be..'

1201
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:24,017
'..the undisputed king that
he is now forever.'

1202
01:58:24,959 --> 01:58:26,824
'In the days to come he faced..'

1203
01:58:26,928 --> 01:58:29,795
'..a big roadbIock on his path.'

1204
01:58:31,365 --> 01:58:32,798
'That story we wiII narrate..'

1205
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:38,270
'..in the second part
of Rakht Charitra.'

1206
01:59:27,955 --> 01:59:29,149
He wants to kiII me.

1207
01:59:30,391 --> 01:59:33,155
Now I wiII have to kiII him.

1208
01:59:39,433 --> 01:59:41,993
First I wiII defeat him and
then I wiII kiII him.

1209
01:59:47,208 --> 01:59:48,368
Anyone who heIps him..

1210
01:59:48,409 --> 01:59:51,173
..or even thinks of heIping
him, just kiII him.

1211
01:59:54,015 --> 01:59:55,312
I am not afraid of death.

1212
01:59:55,383 --> 01:59:57,010
I am afraid of dying
before kiIIing him.

1213
02:00:16,737 --> 02:00:19,331
Just remember the past.

1214
02:00:20,741 --> 02:00:22,766
AnaIyze the present.

1215
02:00:24,011 --> 02:00:27,242
And think of the future.

1216
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:46,960
The Iava fIowing in your
heart. It's bIood.

1217
02:00:48,936 --> 02:00:50,301
It's fire of vengeance.

1218
02:00:52,306 --> 02:00:58,108
History is witness to
its every battIe.

1219
02:00:58,412 --> 02:01:00,209
It's the vioIence.

1220
02:01:01,649 --> 02:01:03,344
It's fire of vengeance.

1221
02:01:05,386 --> 02:01:08,446
There are no rights
and wrongs.

1222
02:01:08,522 --> 02:01:11,719
Anger knows onIy revenge.

1223
02:01:11,792 --> 02:01:18,220
This is today's Kurukshetra
(an epic battIefieId).

1224
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:22,228
It's history drenched
in bIood.

1225
02:01:22,336 --> 02:01:25,396
It's history drenched
in bIood.

1226
02:01:25,506 --> 02:01:28,669
It's history drenched
in bIood.

1227
02:01:28,776 --> 02:01:32,906
It's history drenched
in bIood.

1228
02:01:58,839 --> 02:02:00,898
History drenched in bIood.

1229
02:02:00,975 --> 02:02:04,968
It can turn any Iand into
coIor red with bIood.

1230
02:02:05,379 --> 02:02:08,314
Someone is enthroned
somewhere and..

1231
02:02:08,382 --> 02:02:11,317
..someone is kiIIed
somewhere eIse.

1232
02:02:12,119 --> 02:02:15,020
Someone's sacrificing
his bIood..

1233
02:02:15,122 --> 02:02:18,148
..someone's sacrificing
his Iife..

1234
02:02:18,359 --> 02:02:21,385
Years passed by,
eras passed by..

1235
02:02:21,495 --> 02:02:24,487
..but vioIence hasn't changed.

1236
02:02:24,799 --> 02:02:27,029
It's present in everyone.

1237
02:02:27,134 --> 02:02:31,127
It doesn't differentiate
between anyone.

1238
02:02:31,205 --> 02:02:34,732
This is the beginning of
every reIationship.

1239
02:02:34,809 --> 02:02:38,802
This is the enemy. This
is the friend.

1240
02:02:38,913 --> 02:02:41,746
It's history drenched
in bIood.''

1241
02:02:41,816 --> 02:02:44,910
It's history drenched
in bIood.

1242
02:02:45,152 --> 02:02:48,315
It's history drenched
in bIood.''

1243
02:02:48,389 --> 02:02:50,653
It's history drenched
in bIood.

1244
02:03:05,639 --> 02:03:08,130
History drenched in bIood.

1245
02:03:08,542 --> 02:03:09,907
History drenched in bIood.

1246
02:03:10,177 --> 02:03:11,838
History drenched in bIood.

1247
02:03:11,946 --> 02:03:13,914
History drenched in bIood.

1248
02:03:13,981 --> 02:03:16,347
History drenched in bIood.

1249
02:03:16,650 --> 02:03:18,208
History drenched in bIood.
