1
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,965
All incidents and some
spoof characters in

2
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,973
this film are fictitious,
bear no resemblance

3
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,630
Do you think you are a big man?

4
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,150
How dare you talk back like a prude...

5
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,473
When you are new...

6
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:04,618
learn who's who before
you start pointing things

7
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,150
If not, this happens
Understand?

8
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,110
They're here
Let's go

9
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,230
Let's go now

10
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,030
Maasi...

11
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,990
One minute...

12
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:20,855
Yea what?

13
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,740
They're coming!

14
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:26,965
You wanted to know what's in my mouth

15
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,350
- Here's some fruit
- Maasi!

16
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:34,684
Your death is in my hands!

17
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,830
- Did you bring it?
- Yes, brother

18
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,045
At what time does
Mahima come?

19
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,750
After college at 1

20
00:06:22,023 --> 00:06:22,829
Did you check?

21
00:06:22,854 --> 00:06:23,654
Yes, I did

22
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,390
Recharge for this number

23
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,630
This college, yes?

24
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,483
The women are coming out

25
00:06:52,508 --> 00:06:53,148
Be ready

26
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,030
- This number
- Okay

27
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:09,115
Why is he here?

28
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:17,588
A pepsi

29
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,070
But brother...

30
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,270
What are you looking at?

31
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,614
I've been watching you...

32
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,799
You always make trouble

33
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:50,959
Die!

34
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,550
Attu!

35
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,150
Come quickly!

36
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,870
What the hell!
It burns!

37
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,550
Move!

38
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,430
Faster!
Go go!

39
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:08,590
Why did you lose track and do that?

40
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:09,415
Forget it

41
00:08:09,486 --> 00:08:10,715
It's not rare

42
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,879
But...that's acid!

43
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,710
He threw tea on my face

44
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:14,725
He got it back

45
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,350
I know him well

46
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,710
Just 'cause he's rich F***king twat!

47
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:19,895
He deserved it

48
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,270
Brother!

49
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,950
- Go
- Careful

50
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,590
Brother! Go

51
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,110
Go!

52
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,110
Come, brother!

53
00:08:38,182 --> 00:08:39,342
Come!

54
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,550
Brother! Come! Come!

55
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,230
Come!

56
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,390
Brother, go

57
00:09:44,354 --> 00:09:46,378
Dude! Who are these guys?

58
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:47,123
Sir Sir...
Gotcha!

59
00:09:47,304 --> 00:09:48,104
Let go!
Please sir

60
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,910
I did it in a fit of rage...

61
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:50,753
What?

62
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:52,298
Wait while I catch my breath
Let go!

63
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,390
Hey you!

64
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,070
- You broke the windshield...
- Our car's?

65
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:56,645
and you think you can escape?

66
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,470
Pay up!

67
00:09:57,495 --> 00:09:58,695
Do you know who I am?

68
00:09:58,727 --> 00:09:59,247
One minute

69
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:00,766
Dude, make a note of the address

70
00:10:00,924 --> 00:10:01,964
I'm Maasi!

71
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,710
- Okay You?
- I'm Attu

72
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,590
Of course you are 'attu' and not awesome

73
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,790
What is your name, idiot?
But my name is Attu

74
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:09,325
Sorry dude! It seems his name is Attu

75
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:11,233
My girlfriend will shout at me pay up!

76
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:13,138
There is a guy chasing me with a gun!

77
00:10:14,205 --> 00:10:16,125
That story is hard to
believe even with a knife

78
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,390
And you say a gun, eh! Pay up!

79
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,590
Dude! These guys are real thugs!

80
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:30,609
That was close

81
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:31,870
They would have finished us off

82
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,630
Yea

83
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,481
What are you saying?

84
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:38,346
Where?

85
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:39,391
Start the car!

86
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,110
- What happened?
- Start the car!

87
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,645
What was the issue?

88
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,282
I don't know, sir

89
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:46,267
We don't know what they were arguing about

90
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,750
How did he look?

91
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:48,680
But he...
Oh my God!

92
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:50,585
Dude, why are they talking to the cops?

93
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,899
He was dark and tall

94
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:53,964
Hey, call her quick
There are another guy

95
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:55,557

96

97
00:10:57,251 --> 00:10:58,371
So what is...?

00:10:58,396 --> 00:10:59,396
You come here

99
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,670
What happened to upset you?

100
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,030
What happened, baby?

101
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,510
Tell me, hon...

102
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,270
It's okay there, there

103
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:08,158
What happened?

104
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:09,150
It's nothing...

105
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:10,735
Some guy threw acid on someone...

106
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,680
So she's upset

107
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,190
Were you hurt?

108
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:15,750
And here?

109
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:16,710
It's nothing...

110
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:18,123
He's spooked 'cause a guy
broke the windshield

111
00:11:18,148 --> 00:11:19,788
- They broke the windshield
- It's okay

112
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:21,550
It's okay
Come

113
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:23,095
I'll buy you ice cream

114
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,041
It's very late

115
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:25,946
Where are you two?

116
00:11:25,971 --> 00:11:27,230
We are leaving

117
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:28,501
I'll be there shortly

118
00:11:28,684 --> 00:11:30,844
Please deal with the warden

119
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:32,749
Come soon
Yes yes okay Bye

120
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:34,470
Priya!

121
00:11:34,557 --> 00:11:35,870
Is this salmon?

122
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:36,653
No! That's Nagma

123
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:37,765
Shut up and eat

124
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,550
Dude!

125
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,171
Today was f***ked up!

126
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:41,236
Was that just today?

127
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,950
I couldn't go for my interview

128
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:44,605
They broke the windshield

129
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,870
They nearly threw acid at my girl's face!

130
00:11:47,035 --> 00:11:49,555
That face already looks like
acid has taken a lick

131
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:52,620
Forget it

132
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,285
What would you have done
if she had been acid-attacked?

133
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,066
I would've escaped, dude!

134
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,091
I will slipper you!

135
00:11:58,478 --> 00:11:59,878
Priya!

136
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:01,870
Sorry dude...

137
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:04,015
How much more will you eat? Come!
if something like...

138
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,533
I'll kill him, dude!

139
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,790
Is this enough?

140
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:08,565
Just one more half-boil please...

141
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,436
The warden is already
pissed off come, let's go

142
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:12,310
Abbas, take the car for repair
Saro, wait!

143
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,510
Later!
I'm talking to you

144
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,830
And you are walking away

145
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:16,150
I will stab him!

146
00:12:16,175 --> 00:12:17,855
Don't stab my eye Sit

147
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:19,718
Acid!

148
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:23,047
I will not stop until I find you...

149
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:24,232
...and kill you!

150
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:27,110
How, dude? Like this?

151
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,830
Like this

152
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,070
I'll take a knife...

153
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,230
and if I stab from the back,
it'll come out in the front

154
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:33,990
He'll die, dude

155
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,630
This is hilarious to watch!

156
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,870

and stab the nape of his neck,

159
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,906
it'll come out the front!

160
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:44,774
He'll die, dude

161
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,520

It's Gemini Ganesan

170
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,367
That's what my dad named me

171
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,630
Mummy calls me Bruce Lee

172
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:07,815

00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:09,455
Okay Bruce Lee, sir

00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:40,631
Not bad...

192
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,350
Infamous don Maasi stabbed?!

193
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:04,645
Why is he rejecting my call?

194
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,510
- Get lost!
- You get lost!

195
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,510
Hey! What are you doing?

196
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:26,183
Have you seen my socks?

197
00:15:27,356 --> 00:15:28,716
Where are you leaving to?

198
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,630
The guy who fought us!

199
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,880
Why is lying dead?

200
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:39,352
Have you seen my socks?

201
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,919
I'm telling you a guy is dead and...

202
00:15:40,968 --> 00:15:42,048
you talk about socks

203
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:43,287
You killed him, didn't you?

204
00:15:43,312 --> 00:15:44,825
What did you say!

205
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,890
Why would I kill him?

206
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:47,792
Then how did he die
exactly like you described?

207
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:49,822
That's something even I don't know

208
00:15:50,461 --> 00:15:52,061
You must have done it while drunk

209
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,870
The cops will be here in 10

210
00:15:53,948 --> 00:15:56,028
Plead guilty! Your sentence will be lesser

211
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:57,927
What are you saying! What did I do?

212
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,162
Did I kill him?

213
00:16:07,187 --> 00:16:09,747
You stabbed him clean and through,
just like you said

214
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,116
Will the cops come, like you said?

215
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:13,021
For sure

216
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,570
Dude!

217
00:16:16,595 --> 00:16:17,912
Police!

218
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:18,937
Police!

219
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,150
I'm scared dude!
Just die!

220
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,990
Come!

221
00:16:24,094 --> 00:16:25,060
You answer the door...

222
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,045
the cops will enter and
I'll slyly escape, Go!

223
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:31,030
Hey wait! wait!
Leave me!

224
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:31,855
It's just her!
Hey!

225
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:33,187
Why are you acting like idiots?

226
00:16:33,212 --> 00:16:34,652
He is behaving like an idiot

227
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:35,744
Look at this!

228
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,279
Here! Read this!

229
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,511
He says I killed him

230
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:46,468
Did you kill him?

231
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:48,213
He was the guy who threw acid

232
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:50,763
Is that so?

233
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,516
You avoid her I'll avoid him

234
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,021
Pack your clothes
We're leaving

235
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,039
- Stop talking s**t
- Listen

236
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,844
He committed murder
You are the reason

237
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:00,629
The police will arrest you both in sometime

238
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:01,831
Henceforth, we're strangers

239
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:02,591
Let's go

240
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:05,059
I won't believe you
if you say you are a murderer

241
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:06,964
How can I believe he is one?

242
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,821
Look at his face
Don't you want to laugh?

243
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,190
Let go

244
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,472
He's calling me a murderer

245
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:14,737
You say I have a baby-face

246
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,030
That's enough

247
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,430
Look...

248
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:18,781
I laugh when I look at his face

249
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:20,012
But his name scares me

250
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:20,557
Good bye

251
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:21,422
Abbas!
Dude! Dude!

252
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:22,287
Catch him!
Dude!

253
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,365
Come here!

254
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:23,910
Sit!

255
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,752
My name has a huge flashback

256
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:27,177
I don't have the time We're leaving

257
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:27,936
Sit!

258
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:29,262
Listen for 5 minutes

259
00:17:30,278 --> 00:17:31,705
I've always been afraid of everything

260
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,010
Afraid of dogs...of cats...

261
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:33,879
Very afraid of the elephant...

262
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:35,104
If I refuse to eat,

263
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:36,567
they won't mention the boogieman,

264
00:17:36,592 --> 00:17:39,752
but the police, to force me to eat

265
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,790
Or else
One might be scared of insects...

266
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,580
but have you met someone
scared of butterflies?

267
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:49,705
Seeing me afraid of everything...

268
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:51,325
my mom was worried

269
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,910
And then, something happened

270
00:17:55,104 --> 00:17:57,064
I was watching Action Fridays on TV

271
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,390
Punch!

272
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,350
Punch harder!

273
00:18:04,112 --> 00:18:05,592
I watched that movie

274
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,055
My mom watched my eyes
Punch him! Yes!

275
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:11,036
Harder! Seeing me draw
courage from Bruce Lee...

276
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,870
from that day onwards my mom...

277
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,310
Bruce Lee!

278
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,430
Who me?
Yes! You are Bruce Lee

279
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,190
"Who am I? I'm your daddy"

280
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:21,769
"Grandson of a warrior"

281
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:23,215
"A small argument,"

282
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,000
"we blow it up into a big fight"

283
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:26,456
"Hey! Who's that?"

284
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:28,447
"Who's he? Why are you scared?"

285
00:18:28,472 --> 00:18:29,672
"What's that guy's name?"

286
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,590
"Bruce Lee!"

287
00:18:42,685 --> 00:18:44,565
"Who am I? I'm your daddy"

288
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,970
"Grandson of a warrior"

289
00:18:45,995 --> 00:18:48,635
"I'm here for my revenge
Look out!"

290
00:18:48,768 --> 00:18:51,928
"BAM! Your ears and lungs are torn"

291
00:18:52,024 --> 00:18:54,544
"WHAM! You'll break and tremble in fear"

292
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,883
"Yeah! If you hear his name,"

293
00:18:56,908 --> 00:18:59,308
"you'll shake in fear and gibber"

294
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
Be awesome like Bruce Lee!

295
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:04,704
You dare touch my face!

296
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:05,889
My friend will come now!

297
00:19:05,962 --> 00:19:06,922
Who is he?

298
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,150
Call him here!

299
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,230
"Bruce Lee!"

300
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,270
"Who am I? I'm your daddy"

301
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,748
"Grandson of a warrior"

302
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:26,653
"I'm here for my revenge
Look..."

303
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:31,318
Ow! It hurts, brother!

304
00:19:31,343 --> 00:19:32,743
Brother, brother! Let go!

305
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:34,279
Since I've arrived, I noticed...

306
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:35,224
you are hitting only me

307
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:36,369
You aren't hitting them

308
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,710
Why are you hitting me?

309
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,630
Well...

310
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,270
What did you say your name was?

311
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:43,149
Bruce Lee

312
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,750
Brother! Please!
That's why I hit you!

313
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,087
I was beaten badly that day

314
00:19:51,112 --> 00:19:53,112
I never mention
Bruce Lee to anyone, since

315
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:55,239
I only say Ganesh

316
00:19:55,922 --> 00:19:57,602
What a flashback!

317
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,310
Look! Even he looks pissed off

318
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:02,575
Maybe I can believe you

319
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,840
But the police won't

320
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,079
The police will arrive and shoot you dead

321
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:08,971
What s**t! Get lost! Go!

322
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:11,284
Idiots! You don't be scared, baby

323
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:13,878
Damn! She escaped before
I could try anything

324
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:14,783
Poor guy

325
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:15,968
Will the police come?

326
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:17,673
No darling...They won't

327
00:20:18,473 --> 00:20:19,673
But he said so

328
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:21,849
No! He's just teasing you

329
00:20:21,874 --> 00:20:23,874
Moron! You don't stress

330
00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:26,783
Keep combing my hair

331
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,241
You told me to relax but you seem tensed

332
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:32,986
Tensed?

333
00:20:33,126 --> 00:20:33,780
Who me?

334
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:34,565
I'm not

335
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,510
- Then why is your heart beating fast?
- Is it?

336
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,040
Here...check again?

337
00:20:38,743 --> 00:20:39,823
Shall I?

338
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:40,968
Bruce Lee!

339
00:20:57,926 --> 00:21:00,263
"Hey my sugar mint girl..."

340
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:02,288
"I'm your refreshing jigarthanda"

341
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:04,758
"My colourful girl..."

342
00:21:05,294 --> 00:21:07,614
"Sweet baby, sweetheart..."

343
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,030
"Darling...the pupil of my eyes"

344
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,181
"Come on my sweet demon"

345
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:14,566
"Do something you are not supposed to..."

346
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:16,398
"Lady!"

347
00:21:16,423 --> 00:21:18,306
"When I think of you...Hot..."

348
00:21:18,331 --> 00:21:20,691
"Turn and French me"

349
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:22,567
"There's no stopping"

350
00:21:22,592 --> 00:21:24,232
"My little banshee..."

351
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:27,185
"Lady, you are my heartbeat"

352
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,170
"The centre of my gravity,"

353
00:21:29,195 --> 00:21:31,995
"You are my book of sentiments..."

354
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:34,033
"I am modern Bruce Lee"

355
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,190
"Hey lively girl"

356
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,110
"My little sun"

357
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,630
"You are my girlfriend, you bad girl"

358
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,750
"Miss oh, Miss, you rowdy woman"

359
00:22:00,775 --> 00:22:03,335
"The ginger gin who shares my feelings"

360
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:07,527
"The sky grows colder..."

361
00:22:08,205 --> 00:22:12,524
"And lust engulfs..."

362
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:15,335
"My white liar..."

363
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:17,835
"I want a kiss when you are free"

364
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,520
"Like a seat belt, a hug is enough"

365
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:22,585
"You are my Bedlington puppy..."

366
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:24,345
"Lady!"

367
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,250
"When I think of you...Hot..."

368
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:28,315
"Turn and French me"

369
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,486
"There's no stopping"

370
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:32,591
"My little banshee..."

371
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:35,025
"Lady, you are my heartbeat"

372
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,354
"The centre of my gravity"

373
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:39,859
"You are my book of sentiments..."

374
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,830
"I am modern Bruce Lee"

375
00:22:56,568 --> 00:23:01,404
"Your bewitching eyes, have made me silly"

376
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:06,541
"Sweety, you made a lion into a puppy"

377
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:10,726
"A kiss on my head..."

378
00:23:11,438 --> 00:23:15,798
"I want every second..."

379
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:18,697
"Round and round, around me"

380
00:23:18,722 --> 00:23:20,522
"You came my little sheep"

381
00:23:21,085 --> 00:23:22,322
"Sweetly and softly"

382
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:23,467
"A hide and seek..."

383
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,599
"Move away and close your eyes"

384
00:24:06,983 --> 00:24:08,928
Godfather! He's the
one who killed Maasi

385
00:24:08,953 --> 00:24:09,873
We shouldn't let him go

386
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:12,218
Tell me now
And I'll do him in

387
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,130
Shut up!

388
00:24:13,194 --> 00:24:14,434
Will you not shut up!

389
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,230
Kaasi, let him go

390
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,870
He'll die

391
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:34,534
'A few days before'

392
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:37,950
You

393
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,880
Stop that car

394
00:24:38,982 --> 00:24:40,542
Hey! Stop the car

395
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,320
Why didn't they stop here?

396
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:44,118
'Our' boys, sir...

397
00:24:44,143 --> 00:24:45,503
'Our' boys meaning your sons?

398
00:24:45,846 --> 00:24:47,526
They pay (bribe) on time...

399
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:49,591
It seems like we get
rupees but not respect

400
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,190
- Call them
- Sir, I only meant...

401
00:24:51,285 --> 00:24:54,645
Call them here
Hey, please come here

402
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,060
What's up constable?

403
00:24:56,085 --> 00:24:57,725
Don't you educate the newbies?

404
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,050
You get it on time every month

405
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:01,435
What's with this new protest?

406
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,590
What sir? Any problem?

407
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:04,366
Wow!

408
00:25:04,422 --> 00:25:06,982
Have you become so big
that you solve police problems?

409
00:25:07,823 --> 00:25:10,160
Oh, it's just couple of
street dogs stirring the streets

410
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,120
I came to catch them

411
00:25:11,518 --> 00:25:13,285
Careful, sir It might be rabid

412
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,110
It'll bite

413
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:17,014
Rabid or mange, I'll take care of it
Where are you returning from?

414
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:17,999
It's nothing sir

415
00:25:18,024 --> 00:25:20,384
We were bored and stepped
out to give the cops a job

416
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:23,719
Sarcasm, eh?

417
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,742
Don't you visit a new officer?

418
00:25:27,188 --> 00:25:28,428
Where did you steal from?

419
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:30,792
We don't steal

420
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,230
Then? Are you garbage pickers?

421
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,790
Only 'situations'

422
00:25:34,495 --> 00:25:37,495
You are talking about
situations to a state employee

423
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,070
Won't he step out?

424
00:25:39,462 --> 00:25:40,727
Come here

425
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:42,952
Sir, don't
You come here

426
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,160
Get out now
Sir, easy...

427
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:28,525
Is he the villain?

428
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:30,508
He looks frightfully funny

429
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,390
What's your name?

430
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,670
What's your name sonny?

431
00:26:38,588 --> 00:26:39,948
Ramdass

432
00:26:40,758 --> 00:26:41,758
From?

433
00:26:43,965 --> 00:26:44,725
Madurai

434
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,190
Why won't you talk?

435
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,559
Have you stuffed your mouth on a fruit?

436
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,732
Have you stuffed your mouth on a fruit?

437
00:27:00,655 --> 00:27:02,378
You wanted to know
what he had in his mouth...

438
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:03,923
It was fruit
Here

439
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,790
You are next

440
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:18,264
- That's a horse?
- Dude!

441
00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:20,449
I always wanted to ride a horse

442
00:27:20,593 --> 00:27:21,599
But you do it everyday

443
00:27:21,624 --> 00:27:23,950
- Talk too much and I'll kick you
- Wait

444
00:27:24,112 --> 00:27:25,392
But he is telling the truth

445
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,200
You're taking his side?!

446
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,228
Are you photographing girls?

447
00:27:30,253 --> 00:27:31,322
I'm catching Pokemon

448
00:27:31,347 --> 00:27:32,462
Pokemon!

449
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,350
Get lost!

450
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,750
Jobless!
The joker

451
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:36,120
Idiot
Dude!

452
00:27:36,344 --> 00:27:38,544
That's our chief!
It's a conference

453
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,190
Our chief!

454
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,550
Brother!
When is he expected?

455
00:27:44,605 --> 00:27:45,488
In 10 minutes

456
00:27:45,513 --> 00:27:47,496
Dude! Today we should meet
him and get an autograph

457
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:48,448
Super! Yes!

458
00:27:48,473 --> 00:27:50,058
Hey! Come here

459
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,003
What?

460
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:52,074
An old game

461
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:53,419
Why does she like old things?

462
00:27:53,552 --> 00:27:56,152
6 rings for 50
You win what you catch

463
00:27:56,231 --> 00:27:57,911
We know! You shut it
Give me the cash

464
00:27:58,038 --> 00:27:59,318
50 sir, 50

465
00:28:05,328 --> 00:28:07,830
- Hey get the cash
- What do you want?

466
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:09,055
Sunglasses

467
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,689
You?

468
00:28:09,714 --> 00:28:10,994
Umm
Watch

469
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:11,845
You?

470
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,430
Dude!

471
00:28:12,528 --> 00:28:13,608
I want that alcohol

472
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:15,313
That's my boy!

473
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:15,984
Watch

474
00:28:16,072 --> 00:28:18,152
Aim correctly
Don't miss it

475
00:28:18,544 --> 00:28:20,304
Come on, alcohol!

476
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:21,489
Damn!

477
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,400
Dude! Throw higher

478
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,030
Throw!
Alcohol!

479
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,990
Alcohol!

480
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,670
Alcohol!

481
00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:30,432
Alcohol!

482
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:31,479
Isn't there one more?

483
00:28:31,504 --> 00:28:32,144
Last try

484
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:32,769
Come on

485
00:28:32,801 --> 00:28:33,441
Try it

486
00:28:33,528 --> 00:28:35,328
Don't listen to her
Bag the alcohol

487
00:28:35,353 --> 00:28:36,353
We hit it
We take it

488
00:28:36,486 --> 00:28:37,065
Throw now

489
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,890
How long will you take? Do it

490
00:28:42,142 --> 00:28:44,422
Alcohol! Dude!!

491
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:46,506
Sunglasses!
Throw it!

492
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:47,411
Throw it!

493
00:29:00,343 --> 00:29:02,703
What are you going to do with this?

494
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,590
Boss!

495
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:06,291
You keep the camera and give us the bottle

496
00:29:06,316 --> 00:29:07,676
No way
You can leave

497
00:29:07,775 --> 00:29:09,299
The leader of the people's party

498
00:29:09,324 --> 00:29:13,284
This is such an old camera
This is a digital camera

499
00:29:13,422 --> 00:29:14,844
- Is it working condition?
- Go go go!

500
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:16,109
Let's click pictures
Come

501
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:17,334
Go fast

502
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:37,394
With a heart as huge as Mount Everest
a person who is forever young

503
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:38,739
A Tamil artist

504
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:39,801
Our brother

505
00:29:39,848 --> 00:29:42,488
I invite Mansoor Ali Khan
to address the gathering

506
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:46,495
Chief!

507
00:29:46,527 --> 00:29:47,727
Chief!

508
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:48,912
Chief!

509
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:54,057
My dear people,
who mean more than my life

510
00:29:54,135 --> 00:29:56,695
My warriors in veshtis

511
00:29:56,735 --> 00:29:59,535
My bulls in dhotis

512
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,147
Come!

513
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:04,172
The ladies who are waiting to
take a selfie with me,

514
00:30:04,216 --> 00:30:06,216
In our government
of the golden-age

515
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:10,104
the ginger pickle vendor is
running an engineering college

516
00:30:10,712 --> 00:30:13,472
A beans vendor
runs a Pizza Corner

517
00:30:13,497 --> 00:30:15,497
Where did this change come from?

518
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,842
Without arguing that it's Sunday,
we attended parliamentary sessions

519
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:19,581
Chief!

520
00:30:19,606 --> 00:30:22,726
Once every 5 years to
pass by the constituency

521
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,073
is not the kind
of inept chief I am

522
00:30:25,098 --> 00:30:26,858
- Yes, Chief!
- You are right! Yes!

523
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:30,848
Ask about our achievements
from your house pressure cooker

524
00:30:30,927 --> 00:30:32,327
Even it will whistle!

525
00:30:32,352 --> 00:30:35,392
Because the railway station
is unveiling my statue

526
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,337
I take leave of you

527
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:40,096
Long love
The People's Party Thank you

528
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:56,845
Chief!
Just one autograph please!

529
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,587
I have finally seen you
in person, Chief!

530
00:30:58,612 --> 00:31:00,100
I can die peacefully now!

531
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,391
- That's too much
- Today I'll die happily!

532
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:05,336
Think of your parents! Chief!
Just one autograph please! Long live Chief!

533
00:31:05,361 --> 00:31:07,641
Chief, you must act
in Avatar Part 4

534
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,434
I will place a billboard for it

535
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:11,379
Chief, you can leave

536
00:31:11,525 --> 00:31:13,950
The future President of Africa,
Mansoor Ali Khan!

537
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:17,135
The future Ward Councillor,
Mansoor Ali Khan!

538
00:31:17,229 --> 00:31:19,149
The Voice winner,
Mansoor Ali Khan!

539
00:31:19,182 --> 00:31:21,700
Dancing with the Stars winner,
Mansoor Ali Khan!

540
00:31:21,725 --> 00:31:24,805
'Who wants to be a Millionaire'
winner, Mansoor Ali Khan!

541
00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:27,221
- Absolutely crazy, man!
- Fool, you fool

542
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:29,206
I asked you so many times
for a photo

543
00:31:29,231 --> 00:31:30,549
Why didn't you click one?

544
00:31:30,574 --> 00:31:32,094
It's just a photo
Why make a big deal

545
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:32,959
Dude!
Bruce Lee

546
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:34,865
I got an autograph
from our Chief!

547
00:31:35,015 --> 00:31:36,159
- For me?
- What he said?

548
00:31:36,184 --> 00:31:37,864
I got it for you

549
00:31:38,047 --> 00:31:38,887
Autograph?!

550
00:31:38,912 --> 00:31:41,912
A match stick sparked, a match stick sparked
My dear bird

551
00:31:41,937 --> 00:31:43,377
Are you idiots?

552
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,845
People will be
fans for heroes

553
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,150
Why are you
fans of a villain?

554
00:31:46,175 --> 00:31:48,055
How dare you talk
about my Chief?

555
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,440
- What?
- Have you seen him dance? Mass appeal!

556
00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:51,739
Want to see?
Let's go dude

557
00:31:51,764 --> 00:31:54,604
"My hands hurts and so does
my shoulder and my thigh"

558
00:31:54,687 --> 00:31:56,364
"When a young woman's
hand grazes you"

559
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:58,149
"All diseases will
speed away"

560
00:31:58,174 --> 00:31:59,774
"That's it!"

561
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,650
"Hey Groom!"

562
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:06,478
"Shall I make some coffee?"

563
00:32:06,503 --> 00:32:08,205
"Shall I make some tea?"

564
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,455
"Tell me, my son-in-law"

565
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,887
"Mr.Big shot"

566
00:32:11,912 --> 00:32:14,792
"Tell me, my son-in-law"

567
00:32:15,615 --> 00:32:18,403
"I don't want coffee,
father-in-law"

568
00:32:18,428 --> 00:32:22,788
"I don't want tea,
father-in-law"

569
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:26,378
"A glass of water is enough,
father-in-law for my thirst"

570
00:32:26,434 --> 00:32:29,872
"A glass of water is enough,
father-in-law"

571
00:32:29,897 --> 00:32:32,377
"Is the younger daughter pretty?"

572
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:39,039
"Is the younger daughter pretty?"

573
00:32:39,064 --> 00:32:40,904
"Is the elder daughter pretty?"

574
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:42,929
"Tell me, my son-in-law"

575
00:32:42,954 --> 00:32:43,954
"To accept"

576
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:46,601
"Tell me, my son-in-law"

577
00:32:46,626 --> 00:32:48,066
"What do you say?"

578
00:32:48,137 --> 00:32:51,577
"The younger girl is not pretty"

579
00:32:51,726 --> 00:32:54,846
"The elder girl is also not pretty"

580
00:32:55,922 --> 00:32:57,750
"I don't want the younger girl,
father-in-law"

581
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,523
"I don't want the elder girl,
father-in-law"

582
00:32:59,548 --> 00:33:01,708
"Mother-in-law is enough,
father-in-law"

583
00:33:01,824 --> 00:33:03,158
"Who?
My wife"

584
00:33:03,183 --> 00:33:05,143
"Mother-in-law is enough,
father-in-law"

585
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,870
'OK Doctor, what would
you advise him?'

586
00:33:09,311 --> 00:33:12,401
'Even when one is young, they
should be taught discipline'

587
00:33:12,426 --> 00:33:15,386
Mother-in-law is enough, father-in-law

588
00:33:15,735 --> 00:33:17,335
I'm flying high today

589
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,270
Chief, you belong in Hollywood

590
00:33:21,022 --> 00:33:26,902
That signature head move all

Where are you, chief?

592

Chief!

593
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,190
No matter where you are,
I'll find you

594
00:33:33,215 --> 00:33:34,855
With the same camera

595
00:33:34,952 --> 00:33:37,952
I promise to take
one picture with you

596
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:40,247
Chief?

00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,956
Have you come for me?

599
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:44,621
Long live my Chief!
I'm coming for you!

600
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,871
Hey! Where are you going, Mansoor?

601
00:33:46,896 --> 00:33:48,216
Wait, I'm coming

602
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,910
Boss

603
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,950
He is our Godfather

604
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,670
Please sit

605
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,479
He is Mans-

00:34:31,323 --> 00:34:33,123
Biriyani!

607
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,030
He's seems to be very hungry

608
00:34:44,998 --> 00:34:48,518
A match stick sparked,

609
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,710
Oh there you are, Chief!

610
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:53,389
the gate the gate

611
00:34:53,414 --> 00:34:54,854
Woohoo!

612
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:00,607
Your mouth will
become tired, bro

613
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,750
Oh no

614
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,270
Coochie coochie coo

615
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,030
Click!

616
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,388
The Chief's car!

617
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:13,185
Chief!

618
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,810
You are a handsome man!

619
00:35:15,565 --> 00:35:16,443
Chief

620
00:35:16,468 --> 00:35:17,428
Chief

621
00:35:17,605 --> 00:35:19,253
Come out, come out wherever you are

622
00:35:19,278 --> 00:35:20,958
Come on
Chief, Buddy!

623
00:35:24,615 --> 00:35:25,775
Just a minute

624
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,350
I need to pee

625
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:29,739
"A match stick sparked"

626
00:35:29,764 --> 00:35:32,204
The old guys aren't
there anymore

627
00:35:32,229 --> 00:35:35,269
And I wasn't sure
who to meet

628
00:35:35,484 --> 00:35:37,840
My boy mentioned you
So, I came to meet

629
00:35:37,865 --> 00:35:39,266
The house exterior looks old

630
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:40,452
But inside, it looks like
all fun and frolic

631
00:35:40,477 --> 00:35:43,675
- Chief! There you are!
- Will I get the other parcel?

632
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:47,799
What's with the eagles
and bisons?

633
00:35:47,832 --> 00:35:49,112
Chief!
Chief!

634
00:35:49,143 --> 00:35:50,583
Chief!
Chief!

635
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:53,088
I finally saw you! I finally saw you!

636
00:35:53,316 --> 00:35:55,916
He wearing coat
he vanish into thin air?

637
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,110
Damn!

638
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,110
Just a second

639
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,935
Just a
This guy needs to be taken out

640
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,320
He's a slippery eel

641
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,630
This dog wants to be a
contender for Chief Minister

642
00:36:11,655 --> 00:36:12,857
Here Take this

643
00:36:12,882 --> 00:36:14,392
This is just an advance

644
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,470
Shoot

645
00:36:23,094 --> 00:36:24,045
Chief!

646
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:27,990
No, no, no, no

647
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,395
What the hell have you done!

648
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,137
Do you know who he is?
What a bigwig he is?

649
00:36:42,162 --> 00:36:43,042
He's a minister!

650
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,239
I brought him here

651
00:36:44,264 --> 00:36:45,264
This is not good

652
00:36:46,033 --> 00:36:47,793
Hey, are you retarded?

653
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,910
Won't you tell me, Godfather?

654
00:36:59,935 --> 00:37:01,175
Hey! Couldn't you
have told me?

655
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,160
Come

656
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:04,487
Hey, come!

657
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,900
Will anyone cry all night?

658
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,870
- What is it?
- Look at this photo

659
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,510
Minister!

660
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,630
Isn't his death the reason
why this city is terrorised?

661
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,270
How did you take this?

662
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,414
This is evidence for murder

663
00:38:02,439 --> 00:38:04,119
- Let's go
- Where?

664
00:38:04,246 --> 00:38:05,486
Police station

665
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,860
Get lost!

666
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,965
To explain my crying all night,
I haven't deleted it yet

667
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,310
He's lying
He doesn't know how to delete it

668
00:38:12,335 --> 00:38:13,655
Give me the camera

669
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,510
Delete it

670
00:38:14,535 --> 00:38:16,523
What?
Are you saying we should forget it?

671
00:38:16,548 --> 00:38:19,228
How can we let it go when it's
happened right before us?

672
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:22,887
If we are blind to this we
are making a bigger mistake!

673
00:38:22,973 --> 00:38:25,553
No way! I'm not a hero
to question the wrong

674
00:38:25,578 --> 00:38:26,698
You may not be a hero

675
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:28,203
But I'm a heroine and I will question

676
00:38:28,228 --> 00:38:29,176
Please go ahead

677
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:32,401
Go to the police and court, get justice and
walk back in slow motion

678
00:38:32,426 --> 00:38:34,146
We'll clap for you

679
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:35,598
Dude! You feel me?

680
00:38:35,623 --> 00:38:37,931
She has a rom-com face
and is thinking about action

681
00:38:37,956 --> 00:38:39,796
Why are you behaving
like a chick?

682
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:41,541
Chick? Me?
You are a chick

683
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:42,766
Yes, I am

684
00:38:42,837 --> 00:38:44,557
Aren't you a man?
Behave like one

685
00:38:44,652 --> 00:38:46,017
Shall we wait outside?

686
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:47,117
Get lost

687
00:38:47,142 --> 00:38:47,982
I don't care

688
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,070
Abbas, are you coming or not?

689
00:38:51,056 --> 00:38:52,976
Hey, Bruce Lee is right

690
00:38:53,047 --> 00:38:55,647
Do we need to get involved
with the cops and court?

691
00:38:55,672 --> 00:38:56,312
Scram

692
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,710
You!

693
00:38:57,797 --> 00:38:59,077
Watching Dora!

694
00:38:59,735 --> 00:39:00,695
Give me that

695
00:39:01,335 --> 00:39:02,937
That a minster has no security has...

696
00:39:02,962 --> 00:39:06,722
...made the public panic
and the supporters angry

697
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:10,310
His son and family
are deeply mourning his loss

698
00:39:10,852 --> 00:39:12,195
With elections coming up, his death...

699
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,195
...has caused a major stir
in Tamil politics...His son?

700
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:17,344
This is Ramesh reporting for
Hey why not...

701
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:19,169
...give the camera to his son?

702
00:39:19,194 --> 00:39:21,034
Let him figure it out

703
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:22,391
Let him deal with it

704
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:23,185
What do you say?

705
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:23,930
Yeah
OK

706
00:39:23,955 --> 00:39:24,795
We can try that

707
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,940
OK? OK?

708
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:27,115
Abbas, leave

709
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,700
Let him come only
if he wants to

710
00:39:29,126 --> 00:39:29,970
Where are you going?

711
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:30,755
I'll come with

712
00:39:30,808 --> 00:39:32,288
Why?
Well,

713
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,877
You three ladies are
going by yourself

714
00:39:33,902 --> 00:39:34,902
You need a man

715
00:39:35,189 --> 00:39:36,829
- That's why
- Tall talk

716
00:40:02,648 --> 00:40:05,128
Dude! A plane, above

717
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,430
They'll never learn

718
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,550
Why do you brake like that!

719
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,734
There are cops

720
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:26,559
So what?

721
00:40:26,584 --> 00:40:28,304
- Relax!
- Why are you scared of them?

722
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,515
What should one be scared of?

723
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,460
How to get in?

724
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,790
I don't know how

725
00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:43,807
Wait!

726
00:40:44,821 --> 00:40:46,301
You two wait here

727
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:47,801
Why am I wearing this?

728
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:49,614
This is a girl's ID card!

729
00:40:50,632 --> 00:40:51,712
- Who are you?
- Press, sir

730
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,470
- Go ahead
- Escape!

731
00:40:59,403 --> 00:41:01,110
The body is there

732
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:05,270
What happened?

733
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:07,735
My Chief!
They killed him!

734
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:08,848
Shut it!

735
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,300
He's coming!

736
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:12,485
- I'm going to
- Hey wait!

737
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,430
Let go!

738
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:16,064
Sir
Ma'am!

739
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:18,089
I need to speak
Please step back, Ma'am

740
00:41:18,122 --> 00:41:19,682
He is going to talk to you
Step back

741
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:24,317
What do you want me to say?

742
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,350
What did he do?

743
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:29,845
He was always about
his Political party

744
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:33,470
I don't know if the murderer a
party member or the opposition

745
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:00,931
- Yes, dude?
- He is here too

746
00:42:00,956 --> 00:42:03,156
- Who?
- It's that Godfather

747
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,230
Who?
Forget it Bye

748
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,630
I am but a young boy
What can I do?

749
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,390
But there is one thing the
guy who killed my father...

750
00:42:11,466 --> 00:42:12,896
...should be legally punished,

751
00:42:12,921 --> 00:42:15,561
whoever he is,
however rich he his

752
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:17,465
I will not rest until then

753
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:21,130
This government, the police,
I don't believe anyone

754
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:23,113
I believe only in you

755
00:42:23,138 --> 00:42:25,058
How could one have
the heart to do this?

756
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:28,293
Do you know how much
he has done for the people?

757
00:42:28,576 --> 00:42:30,176
Please support me

758
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:33,201
In this matter, I trust only
the media and the people

759
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:34,699
You are enough

760
00:42:34,724 --> 00:42:36,324
I trust only you

761
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:38,207
Please help find the murderer

762
00:42:38,247 --> 00:42:39,687
That would mean a lot

763
00:42:40,832 --> 00:42:41,700
Godfather!

764
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,605
They've killed my dad, Godfather!

765
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,310
He was true to everyone

766
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,790
He is posing for pictures
Is he mental?

767
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:59,163
A gun is passed to him
He's going to kill him too

768
00:42:59,188 --> 00:43:00,382
Come
Let's leave

769
00:43:00,487 --> 00:43:02,073
Let's leave come
What are you saying

770
00:43:02,098 --> 00:43:03,578
Let's go follow
Come!

771
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:07,286
Who are you?
What do you want?

772
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:09,627
Restroom
I need to use the restroom

773
00:43:09,652 --> 00:43:11,052
Yes That's right
Restroom

774
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:12,670
Brother

775
00:43:13,087 --> 00:43:14,447
Come this side

776
00:43:18,945 --> 00:43:20,485
Going somewhere?

777
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,434
Restroom, brother

778
00:43:21,459 --> 00:43:22,979
Go that side
You can go, Ma'am

779
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,470
That's the ladies room

780
00:43:27,295 --> 00:43:29,095
I don't know what to do

781
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,015
So many calls since morning

782
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,030
Sir's gun

783
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:48,942
He left it behind

784
00:43:48,967 --> 00:43:54,327
My dad instead his head,
should have been shot here

785
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:56,384
What a despicable man!

786
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:58,143
Has a son at every constituency

787
00:43:58,191 --> 00:44:00,991
He would have made his sons
contest at every constituency

788
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:04,191
Good thing we took care of it

789
00:44:04,216 --> 00:44:05,376
Or else,

790
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,982
he would have talked to the press
about his wives and sons

791
00:44:08,007 --> 00:44:09,487
Have you received the amount?

792
00:44:09,575 --> 00:44:10,535
I've spoken to sir

793
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,840
He wants to contest now

794
00:44:11,865 --> 00:44:14,025
- We'll see about the next
- Brother

795
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,370
Our leader has arrived
Leader is here

796
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,840
Where did you go?

797
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:30,710
- Come!
- Did you see them?

798
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,390
Did you give it? Well?
Answer!

799
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:35,576
The son murdered the father

800
00:44:35,662 --> 00:44:36,530
How do you know?

801
00:44:36,555 --> 00:44:38,225
I overheard at the restroom

802
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,090
You return with problems
when you go to pee

803
00:44:40,154 --> 00:44:41,634
Shut it
Let's go now

804
00:44:46,102 --> 00:44:48,662
Fortunately, we didn't
say anything to him

805
00:44:49,128 --> 00:44:51,118
The Godfather would
have butchered us

806
00:44:51,411 --> 00:44:52,211
Bro,

807
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:55,743
If it's easy to do good, then the
world won't have any bad people

808
00:44:55,768 --> 00:44:59,048
Doing good is the only
investment without profit

809
00:44:59,073 --> 00:45:01,273
That's why no one does it

810
00:45:01,374 --> 00:45:04,457
That's why the good ones
call it Karma

811
00:45:04,482 --> 00:45:06,122
Cause then, someone may do good

812
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,550
Dude, if someone falls on the road
why do we help them right away?

813
00:45:09,787 --> 00:45:12,565
Because if we slip we hope
that someone will help us up

814
00:45:12,807 --> 00:45:14,615
There is no charity in the world
No, no

815
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,000
Everything is selfish

816
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,694
Why are we itching to get justice?

817
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,174
Cause if someone kills us
we hope someone gets us justice

818
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:24,576
Bruce Lee

819
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:25,765
When we do good
Oh God!

820
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,841
Please stop talking

821
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,843
Drive straight to the police station

822
00:45:29,868 --> 00:45:31,588
I'll even plead guilty
to this murder

823
00:45:31,613 --> 00:45:33,773
But no more punch lines please!

824
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,510
Talk only about what
we should do now

825
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,590
How about the Press?

826
00:45:46,383 --> 00:45:48,983
We could, but we don't know anyone

827
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,959
We'll get into trouble if we aren't careful

828
00:45:53,255 --> 00:45:55,175
It's better to know someone...

829
00:45:58,673 --> 00:45:59,673
What's the time?

830
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:02,670
12:10...

831
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:09,310
"It's nothing but the truth"

832
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:10,469
Hi Uncle! How are you?

833
00:46:10,494 --> 00:46:11,894
This is Suprajit's daughter...

834
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:13,243
- Remember me?
- Yes, dear Go on

835
00:46:13,268 --> 00:46:14,748
Can we meet you now?

836
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,870
I'm out of town regarding a case

837
00:46:16,895 --> 00:46:19,110
How about tomorrow at court?
OK uncle I'll come

838
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,565
Thank you
OK dear

839
00:46:24,111 --> 00:46:25,551
Yesterday's blouse was better

840
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:26,323
No, this is better

841
00:46:26,348 --> 00:46:29,081
We're going to court at 10am tomorrow

842
00:46:29,106 --> 00:46:30,026
Why?

843
00:46:30,051 --> 00:46:31,571
To meet my father's acquaintance

844
00:46:31,596 --> 00:46:33,796
And he's a lawyer Don't be late OK?
Bye!

845
00:46:34,885 --> 00:46:35,628
Dude...

846
00:46:35,653 --> 00:46:37,973
There is a guy here
making a joke out of everything

847
00:46:38,023 --> 00:46:40,503
A joke in court?
Watch where you're going, moron

848
00:46:40,934 --> 00:46:42,654
Why are they all laughing?

849
00:46:43,732 --> 00:46:45,252
Order, Order!

850
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:53,682
He isn't an innocent person,
as he pretends to be

851
00:46:53,776 --> 00:46:56,176
He's a cold-blooded murderer He's a psycho

852
00:46:56,415 --> 00:46:57,735
He kills if he gets angry

853
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,084
He kills for money
He kills for political benefits

854
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,109
He kills for business

855
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,490
Put him in jail
Sentence of the highest degree, your Honour

856
00:47:03,515 --> 00:47:04,795
That's all, Your Honour

857
00:47:05,421 --> 00:47:06,221
Excellent!

858
00:47:06,246 --> 00:47:07,206
Isn't that your uncle?

859
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:09,447
Then?

860
00:47:10,638 --> 00:47:11,998
Order Order

861
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:13,598
He sounds funny

862
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:14,870
My Lord...

863
00:47:15,111 --> 00:47:16,351
My client...

864
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,910
doesn't kill when he is angry

865
00:47:19,088 --> 00:47:20,088
He eats

866
00:47:20,365 --> 00:47:21,845
When angry...

867
00:47:21,936 --> 00:47:23,176
some shout...

868
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,590
some cry...

869
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:25,350
but...

870
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:26,870
only one in a million will...

871
00:47:27,006 --> 00:47:28,206
eat a lot

872
00:47:28,566 --> 00:47:29,446
They are...

873
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,191
emotional eaters

874
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:32,270
So...

875
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,950
He is an emotional eater

876
00:47:34,296 --> 00:47:36,296
Here is the medical certificate

877
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,343
I request Mr Pillai to google...

878
00:47:39,525 --> 00:47:40,956
about emotional eating

879
00:47:40,981 --> 00:47:43,899
Or I could ask my secretary to send a link

880
00:47:43,924 --> 00:47:44,984
Let him read that

881
00:47:45,051 --> 00:47:46,931
Why did you leave?
Then?

882
00:47:46,956 --> 00:47:48,983
Are you suggesting talking to his lawyer?
Leave me out

883
00:47:49,008 --> 00:47:52,209
But...He supports
that guy knowing well he is bad

884
00:47:52,234 --> 00:47:53,241
How will he support us?

885
00:47:53,266 --> 00:47:55,005
That's their job

886
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:55,967
Let's try and talk...

887
00:47:55,992 --> 00:47:57,712
From the evidence...

888
00:47:57,744 --> 00:48:00,544
this court deems
the defendant as not guilty

889
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,617
That won't work

890
00:48:05,642 --> 00:48:07,484
No Listen to me!

891
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:08,949
I'll handle it
Godfather...

892
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,200
You had the judge wound up, alright...

893
00:48:11,272 --> 00:48:12,272
Am I right?

894
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,110
Godfather...

895
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:17,590
A joke

896
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:19,950
A joke?

897
00:48:20,395 --> 00:48:21,635
Godfather!

898
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:22,985
A joke

899
00:48:24,632 --> 00:48:27,232
The torture of being
hitched to his madman...

900
00:48:27,439 --> 00:48:29,399
Are you coming or not?
No You can go

901
00:48:29,485 --> 00:48:30,338
Pew!

00:48:30,363 --> 00:48:31,803

How is your dad?

910
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,670
There's a case that...
Shhh! Shut up

911
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,501
It's nothing, Uncle She wants a divorce

912

913

Leave!

921
00:49:04,047 --> 00:49:05,087
Look!

922
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:07,191
in front of the court and all these police,

923
00:49:07,216 --> 00:49:09,616
he is going Pew! Pew! with a gun

924
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:12,081
And to tell them, he is a murderer...

925
00:49:12,106 --> 00:49:13,786
and his gun is real...

926
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:15,424
will be why we get shot

927
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:16,950
You shut it! I know

928
00:49:19,172 --> 00:49:20,532
Pew!

929
00:49:20,879 --> 00:49:21,719
Pew!

930
00:49:21,744 --> 00:49:22,424
Pew!

931
00:49:22,471 --> 00:49:23,311
You're right

932
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:24,616
In front of a court...

933
00:49:24,648 --> 00:49:27,168
amongst all the cops,
he is acting like a clown

934
00:49:27,262 --> 00:49:28,382
He should be...

935
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:30,868
Sigh...she is a piece of work

936
00:49:31,285 --> 00:49:33,565
You shouldn't take
photographs inside the court

937
00:49:34,295 --> 00:49:35,255
Pew!

938
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:37,950
There's our lawyer

939
00:49:38,087 --> 00:49:39,007
Godfather!

940
00:49:39,245 --> 00:49:40,925
that's our lawyer, who's become a judge

941
00:49:41,005 --> 00:49:41,765
Brother!

942
00:49:43,911 --> 00:49:44,871
Pew!

943
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,078
You! What did you do?

944
00:49:49,103 --> 00:49:51,271
Get into the car! Godfather!
Are you mental?

945
00:49:51,296 --> 00:49:53,136
Hey, start the car Quickly!

946
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:54,732
Oh Godfather!
He's getting away

947
00:49:54,757 --> 00:49:56,717
Get out of our way! Move it!

948
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:04,679
I can't do this anymore

949
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:06,367
I swear, I can't

950
00:50:08,465 --> 00:50:10,625
Anyone in my shoes, will think the same

951
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,400
We throw the camera away and...

952
00:50:12,425 --> 00:50:14,225
we get back to our business

953
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:15,193
What?

954
00:50:15,218 --> 00:50:16,578
They've killed the Minister

955
00:50:16,687 --> 00:50:17,767
There's a murder at court

956
00:50:17,792 --> 00:50:19,232
and we have the evidence

957
00:50:19,605 --> 00:50:22,686
Are you asking us
to give in knowing all this?

958
00:50:22,711 --> 00:50:25,471
And it's not one, but two murders
Shut your mouth

959
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:27,255
You talk too much
Fine, I'll stop

960
00:50:27,521 --> 00:50:28,231
To the commissioner's office

961
00:50:28,256 --> 00:50:29,096
My dear...

962
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:30,703
I don't care if you call me a chick...

963
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:32,550
I'd rather be alive, than be a man

964
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,615
That's important

965
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:34,630
I'm leaving

966
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,055
Why do you wear a pant and shirt?

967
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,720
Will my dress fit you?

968
00:50:39,852 --> 00:50:41,612
Do you want to wear my clothes?

969
00:50:47,528 --> 00:50:48,288
Dude!

970
00:50:49,181 --> 00:50:50,501
I'll kill you

971
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:51,390
What?

972
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:52,710
What was that!

973
00:51:05,449 --> 00:51:07,569
Go talk to her Go

974
00:51:11,127 --> 00:51:12,087
I'm sorry

975
00:51:14,585 --> 00:51:16,105
What do you want me to do?

976
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,190
Sorry

977
00:51:18,221 --> 00:51:19,915
Let's go to the commissioner

978
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,909
The commissioner?
I'm already afraid of cops...

979
00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:23,549
She's mentioning the commissioner

980
00:51:24,653 --> 00:51:25,541
OK

981
00:51:25,566 --> 00:51:26,926
Let's not meet directly

982
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,400
Is there another way?

983
00:51:28,531 --> 00:51:30,380
Shall we email him?

984
00:51:30,526 --> 00:51:32,919
Super! Nope
They'll find us through the IP address

985
00:51:32,975 --> 00:51:35,295
And then they'll torture us with enquiry

986
00:51:36,578 --> 00:51:38,178
What do we do?

987
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:40,044
Can we courier it?

988
00:51:40,069 --> 00:51:42,029
But it might get misplaced

989
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:44,950
How about delivering it
in person like a courier boy?

990
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:45,885
Great idea!

991
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:47,030
Who will deliver it?

992
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:49,710
You

993
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:50,658
Me?

994
00:51:50,683 --> 00:51:52,523
You look handsome, just like a courier boy

995
00:51:52,548 --> 00:51:53,388
Hey!

996
00:51:53,487 --> 00:51:54,687
I'm already afraid of cops...

997
00:51:54,712 --> 00:51:56,293
How can I get inside
the commissioner office?

998
00:51:56,318 --> 00:51:58,798
No one wears a uniform there
For real?

999
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,403
Hey keep him distracted
I need to check my mail

1000
00:52:01,428 --> 00:52:01,988
Take it

1001
00:52:02,013 --> 00:52:03,853
Have you lost weight?
I'm hitting the gym

1002
00:52:03,878 --> 00:52:04,838
Look at my arms
Oh yea

1003
00:52:04,863 --> 00:52:05,703
Got it Let's go

1004
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,280
We came to get a delivery uniform
What are we doing here?

1005
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:10,345
He'll come this way
How do you know?

1006
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:12,230
Whenever we have a problem in life...

1007
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:13,175
he will show up

1008
00:52:13,223 --> 00:52:14,412
Will he show up with an uniform?

1009
00:52:14,437 --> 00:52:15,677
With a cap, too

1010
00:52:17,591 --> 00:52:18,591
Come!

1011
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:20,748
What?

1012
00:52:20,773 --> 00:52:22,213
Get lost!

1013
00:52:24,769 --> 00:52:26,769
The fatso lied to me

1014
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,670
Where did he go?

1015
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,710
Excuse me
Yes? It's me

1016
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:05,630
Dude! what is this?

1017
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:06,950
That guy we hit this morning...

1018
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:07,523
Yea...

1019
00:53:07,548 --> 00:53:09,188
He's here with a few guys Look

1020
00:53:10,935 --> 00:53:11,921
Won't they find you?

1021
00:53:11,946 --> 00:53:13,226
I'm in disguise

1022
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,320

...guy who comes here everyday to drink?

1027
00:53:25,821 --> 00:53:27,647
I don't know him

1028
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:29,519
You seem to be new...

1029
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:31,671

00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,455

00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:23,318
Sir!

1108
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:26,569
Until now, we've photos of him
murdering someone Right?

1109
00:57:26,656 --> 00:57:29,456
Let's take a photo of him being arrested
Oh dear, Bruce Lee!

1110
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,142
OK Wait, I'll come along

1111
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:32,127
Be gone

1112
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:33,239
Hey!

1113
00:57:33,264 --> 00:57:34,071
Where are you going?

1114
00:57:34,142 --> 00:57:35,822
They rarely step out of the room

1115
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,159
Come now
Hey!

1116
00:57:42,702 --> 00:57:44,142
Commissioner! Come, let's run away!

1117
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,515
Where are you going?

1118
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,640
Wait, let's listen...
What the judges at the court say...

1119
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,455
what the minister's speak at home...

1120
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:50,590
forget all that

1121
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:52,576
There is a guy shooting pictures of you

1122
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:53,561
You shoot him, before all

1123
00:57:53,586 --> 00:57:55,626
But it wasn't me
It maybe so, Godfather...

1124
00:57:55,759 --> 00:57:57,959
If something like this happens again...

1125
00:57:57,984 --> 00:57:59,264
I'll have to shoot

1126
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,878
Hey Kaasi, take care

1127
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:23,550
We're caught

1128
00:58:23,575 --> 00:58:25,255
Yes, we are caught

1129
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:26,430
They'll kill us

1130
00:58:26,611 --> 00:58:28,371
Yes They'll kill us

1131
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:29,720
We have to escape

1132
00:58:29,745 --> 00:58:31,145
Yes
Yes, we have to escape

1133
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,535
What happened?

1134
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,680
What is it, Godfather?

1135
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:45,270
Restroom...I need to use the restroom

1136
00:58:46,528 --> 00:58:48,768
It's not a boy who shot the photos

1137
00:58:49,825 --> 00:58:51,305
It's a girl

1138
00:58:52,207 --> 00:58:53,727
Let's not be in town for two days

1139
00:58:53,752 --> 00:58:54,688
Shall we go someplace?
Hey!

1140
00:58:54,713 --> 00:58:55,833
Where exactly?

1141
00:58:55,858 --> 00:58:56,858
Pondicherry?

1142
00:58:56,936 --> 00:58:58,102
My friend has a place there

1143
00:58:58,127 --> 00:58:59,247
Are we leaving now?

1144
00:58:59,272 --> 00:59:00,272
We can't go today

1145
00:59:00,385 --> 00:59:01,545
There will be checkpoints

1146
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:02,530
The police will catch us

1147
00:59:02,608 --> 00:59:03,986
You shouldn't drink and drive

1148
00:59:04,011 --> 00:59:05,691
But only we drank You can drive

1149
00:59:06,312 --> 00:59:07,032
No...

1150
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:09,110
I had two shots because I was also happy

1151
00:59:09,601 --> 00:59:10,521
You sinner!

1152
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:11,765
This explains Pondicherry

1153
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:12,446
Another thing...

1154
00:59:12,471 --> 00:59:15,203
I can't leave
whenever I want from the hostel

1275
01:03:46,334 --> 01:03:48,574

Of course, I love my girl

1277
01:03:50,232 --> 01:03:52,432
I got scared when she called me

1278
01:03:52,457 --> 01:03:53,937
I don't know...I spoke nonsense

1279
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:54,990

01:04:06,344 --> 01:04:07,584
Where is the camera?

1286
01:04:08,112 --> 01:04:09,472

the camera...

1288
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:14,430
All our problems...

1289
01:04:14,588 --> 01:04:15,588
are because of you

1290
01:04:16,132 --> 01:04:19,132
My life was good
You ruined it

1291
01:04:19,838 --> 01:04:21,838
The bane of my life

1292
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,310
Getting rid of you is my priority

1293
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:28,470
Die!

1294
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:34,230
What a big river!

1295
01:04:34,356 --> 01:04:36,476
How can I find a camera in here?

1296
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:40,420
Oh God!

1297
01:04:40,445 --> 01:04:42,285
They are calling me

1298
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:44,099
Hello?
The camera...

1299
01:04:44,124 --> 01:04:45,444
Sir? sir?
Can you hear me?

1300
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:46,685
...battery is running out...

1301
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:49,110
I...I...I'll call you
Hello? Can you...?

1302
01:04:49,254 --> 01:04:51,254
They've called us
What do we do?

1303
01:04:51,823 --> 01:04:53,230
Shall we go to the police?

1304
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:53,941
The police?

1305
01:04:53,966 --> 01:04:55,606
Shut it
The Commissioner is their friend

1306
01:04:55,631 --> 01:04:56,951
The police won't help

1307
01:04:57,070 --> 01:04:58,510
What can we do?

1308
01:04:58,565 --> 01:04:59,452
I don't know

1309
01:04:59,477 --> 01:05:00,797
But don't worry, dude

1310
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:02,590
I'll save your girl

1311
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:06,030
The fool is making jokes in this situation

1312
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:08,430
Dude!

1313
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:09,623
Shall we approach a thug?

1314
01:05:09,648 --> 01:05:10,328
A thug?

1315
01:05:10,353 --> 01:05:11,953
Thugs know thugs well

1316
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:13,150
They have a link

1317
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:13,910
Oh!

1318
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:23,870
Dude...

1319
01:05:23,972 --> 01:05:25,355
Thugs know other thugs

1320
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,628
They have a link

1321
01:05:26,653 --> 01:05:28,373
If we tell them what happened...

1322
01:05:28,398 --> 01:05:29,413
they will help us

1323
01:05:29,438 --> 01:05:30,598
I don't know any thug

1324
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:32,790
I know well that you know nothing

1325
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:34,430
But, there is an idea

1326
01:05:34,509 --> 01:05:35,749
My uncle is a don

1327
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:37,390
If we tell him what happened...

1328
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:38,870
...he will surely help us

1329
01:05:39,776 --> 01:05:40,990
Your uncle?

1330
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:41,979
A don?

1331
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:43,324
Is this believable?

1332
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:44,910
I swear my uncle is a don

1333
01:05:44,935 --> 01:05:46,415
Which area?
Royapuram

1334
01:05:47,697 --> 01:05:48,537
Royapuram...

1335
01:05:49,790 --> 01:05:50,590
Royapuram...

1336
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:52,870
Let's go

1337
01:05:58,510 --> 01:05:59,590
Dude!

1338
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,520
You mentioned some noise in the car...

1339
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:03,740
Tic, tic...

1340
01:06:03,927 --> 01:06:06,247
I can hear it
Yea...

1341
01:06:06,365 --> 01:06:08,726
It's a carburettor-shock absorber
issue in the engine

1342
01:06:08,751 --> 01:06:09,551
What?

1343
01:06:09,576 --> 01:06:11,096
Drive into a pothole

1344
01:06:12,853 --> 01:06:14,013
Can you hear it?

1345
01:06:15,285 --> 01:06:16,925
Dude, I can hear it

1346
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:18,270
Is it?

1347
01:06:18,359 --> 01:06:20,039
Pull over to the side

1348
01:06:22,128 --> 01:06:23,328
How is that heard?

1349
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:26,870
Now, dude?
Yes, I can still hear it

1350
01:06:27,287 --> 01:06:28,247
Now, dude?

1351
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:30,310
Dude, dude! It stopped
Get in Come

1352
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:31,437
I knew it

1353
01:06:31,462 --> 01:06:32,782
I can hear it again

1354
01:06:32,934 --> 01:06:34,254
What the...!

1355
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:44,950
It stopped
Don't move Come!

1356
01:06:45,735 --> 01:06:46,935
Easy now

1357
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:50,502
Did you see that?

1358
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,390
I'm a big engineer, dude

1359
01:06:52,445 --> 01:06:54,858
Benz and BWM's are a piece of cake

1360
01:06:54,883 --> 01:06:56,043
You are awesome, dude!

1361
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:57,510
Top notch!

1362
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:00,230
Dude...

1363
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:02,070
My uncle doesn't like back talk,

1364
01:07:02,095 --> 01:07:03,575
talking loud,

1365
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,760
and speaking in English

1366
01:07:04,814 --> 01:07:06,694
To sum it, my uncle doesn't like talking

1367
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:08,554
Then how can...?
We have to

1368
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:10,539
It's all the same

1369
01:07:12,055 --> 01:07:13,775
Talk less and...
Get out of the way!

1370
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,000
Who the...?
Chief!

1371
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:22,430
Logu and Dev kidnapped Commissioner's
daughters at the sugarcane fields

1372
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:23,995
Praba is also there

1373
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:26,540
Uthra has left with Prabha's cash

1374
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:28,270
Kuruvi's also gone there

1375
01:07:29,232 --> 01:07:30,352
Does Sathya know?

1376
01:07:30,455 --> 01:07:31,495
He does, chief...

1377
01:07:31,605 --> 01:07:33,485
Sathya will take care of the kids

1378
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:35,190
But Kiruba will die

1379
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:37,708
What are you saying, Chief!

1380
01:07:37,733 --> 01:07:39,653
Kiruba will die?

1381
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:42,070
It's unfair how Kuruvi will die too

1382
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:43,614
Kuruvi will die too?

1383
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:45,639
It's ok if Kiruba dies

1384
01:07:45,712 --> 01:07:48,072
But why should Kuruvi die?

1385
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,937
Oh no! Kuruvi!

1386
01:07:51,441 --> 01:07:52,761
Kuruvi!

1387
01:07:52,786 --> 01:07:54,706
Oh my God...

1388
01:07:54,927 --> 01:07:55,805
Dude...

1389
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:58,710
Narrating what's done, is normal
How can he predict the future?

1390
01:07:58,759 --> 01:07:59,799
I told you...

1391
01:07:59,988 --> 01:08:02,190
Uncle would've sketched
the whole thing for them

1392
01:08:02,215 --> 01:08:02,855
Come!

1393
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:03,990
Hey!

1394
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:05,808
Yes, you have your lucky charm

1395
01:08:08,587 --> 01:08:09,827
Uncle...

1396
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:11,626
Welcome...

1397
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:13,750
I...a girl...

1398
01:08:13,805 --> 01:08:14,685
A girl?

1399
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:16,159
I'm in love with a girl, uncle

1400
01:08:16,184 --> 01:08:16,824
What!

1401
01:08:16,879 --> 01:08:17,839
You are in love?

1402
01:08:17,864 --> 01:08:19,807
Yes, Uncle I'm in love with a girl

1403
01:08:19,832 --> 01:08:21,192
And she's kidnapped

1404
01:08:21,217 --> 01:08:24,817
Let go! Don't take out your anger
because I didn't marry Anjali

1405
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:27,045
In my next life, I'll marry Anjali

1406
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:28,230
I want my girl for this life

1407
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,224
Help us, uncle!

1408
01:08:30,249 --> 01:08:31,287
It's not what you think

1409
01:08:31,312 --> 01:08:32,229
I know, uncle...

1410
01:08:32,254 --> 01:08:33,334
that you are a don and...

1411
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,239
that you don't get involved in small matters

1412
01:08:35,264 --> 01:08:36,424
Do anything, uncle!

1413
01:08:36,449 --> 01:08:38,569
I don't have anyone else but you
Of course, I'll help,

1414
01:08:38,663 --> 01:08:40,384
I'll get up only when you promise

1415
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:41,489
I will save her!

1416
01:08:41,735 --> 01:08:44,206
No! I'll get up
when you swear on your mom

1417
01:08:44,231 --> 01:08:46,031
I swear on mom, dad
and everyone Get up!

1418
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:49,269
Dude, calm down
Help me, uncle!

1419
01:08:49,294 --> 01:08:50,854
You shouldn't cry like a baby

1420
01:08:52,127 --> 01:08:53,007
Uncle?

1421
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:54,958
Who is he?
God...Godfa...

1422
01:08:54,983 --> 01:08:55,638
Hey!

1423
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:57,270
I don't know, uncle

1424
01:08:57,351 --> 01:08:58,271
Which area?

1425
01:08:58,296 --> 01:08:59,416
That's
Wait!

1426
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:00,395
I don't know, uncle

1427
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:01,900
How do you know about the kidnapping?

1428
01:09:01,984 --> 01:09:02,984
He called, uncle
Dude!

1429
01:09:03,009 --> 01:09:03,969
Don't!
Hey!

1430
01:09:04,423 --> 01:09:05,103
Who is this?

1431
01:09:05,128 --> 01:09:06,208
Bruce Lee

1432
01:09:06,233 --> 01:09:06,953
Bru...?

1433
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:07,875
Hi!

1434
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:08,900
My friend, uncle

1435
01:09:08,925 --> 01:09:10,165
They kidnapped his girl too

1436
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:11,070
Call them

1437
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:11,910
Why?

1438
01:09:13,032 --> 01:09:14,912
Only then can we figure out their area

1439
01:09:14,937 --> 01:09:15,657
How?

1440
01:09:15,682 --> 01:09:17,320
Why are you talking like this?

1441
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:19,110
We can't get out alive

1442
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,340
Hello!

1443
01:09:22,365 --> 01:09:23,925
We've kidnapped your chick

1444
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:24,830
Hey!

1445
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,143
Don't freak out!

1446
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:28,309
Nothing will happen to your chick

1447
01:09:28,334 --> 01:09:29,897
If you think of screwing me over...

1448
01:09:29,922 --> 01:09:31,522
your chick will bite the big one

1449
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:33,627
Give me my money...

1450
01:09:33,652 --> 01:09:35,332
and walk away with her

1451
01:09:35,493 --> 01:09:36,973
This is north Madras

1452
01:09:36,998 --> 01:09:37,718
Hello!

1453
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:39,790
We've taken your girl

1454
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,190
Don't be afraid

1455
01:09:41,230 --> 01:09:43,110
Nothing will happen to your girl

1456
01:09:43,135 --> 01:09:44,855
Give us the payment
Take your girl

1457
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,840
Understand?

1458
01:09:45,865 --> 01:09:46,985
This is normal Madras

1459
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:48,462
Super, uncle!
Hey!

1460
01:09:48,487 --> 01:09:49,727
Keep quiet

1461
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:50,990
Give the phone

1462
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,196
Where is the bomb that was here?
Maasi has it

1463
01:09:56,221 --> 01:09:57,501
What is Maasi...

1464
01:09:58,485 --> 01:09:59,168
Search

1465
01:09:59,193 --> 01:10:02,313
I gave it to Maasi and
I don't know where it is now

1466
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:04,510
Wasn't it somewhere here?

1467
01:10:05,093 --> 01:10:06,612
Brother! Kaasi, brother, do you know?

1468
01:10:06,714 --> 01:10:08,074
What is it again?

1469
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:09,110
Hello?

1470
01:10:09,135 --> 01:10:10,215
Hello, villain sir...

1471
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,400
Please talk for 5 minutes

1472
01:10:11,425 --> 01:10:12,779
My uncle wants to hear your voice

1473
01:10:12,804 --> 01:10:13,404
You...!

1474
01:10:13,465 --> 01:10:14,225
Villain sir...

1475
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:15,290
He's babbling...

1476
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,200
Don't mistake us...

1477
01:10:16,225 --> 01:10:17,985
Tell me where to come
and give the camera

1478
01:10:18,064 --> 01:10:18,944
No, son...

1479
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:21,110
Is your uncle the police?

1480
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:22,118
No sir...
Listen...

1481
01:10:22,143 --> 01:10:24,103
No police can do anything against me

1482
01:10:24,169 --> 01:10:26,209
Only if I speak for longer than 80 seconds...

1483
01:10:26,272 --> 01:10:27,512
can you trace my number

1484
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:28,227
Do you know?

1485
01:10:28,252 --> 01:10:29,672
It's not what you think, villain sir

1486
01:10:29,697 --> 01:10:30,617
He's being funny

1487
01:10:30,642 --> 01:10:31,922
Godfather...
One minute...

1488
01:10:32,693 --> 01:10:33,922
Did you want 1 or 2 biriyanis?

1489
01:10:33,947 --> 01:10:35,267
Biriyani?
Two

1490
01:10:36,613 --> 01:10:38,333
Chicken biriyani or mutton?

1491
01:10:38,885 --> 01:10:40,125
Chicken biriyani

1492
01:10:40,743 --> 01:10:41,543
Hey...

1493
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:42,830
Hey...

1494
01:10:42,991 --> 01:10:44,351
Tell me, Godfather

1495
01:10:44,582 --> 01:10:45,502
Madurai Pandiyan

1496
01:10:48,114 --> 01:10:49,653
Is the 80 seconds over?

1497
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:50,798
No, sir...

1498
01:10:50,973 --> 01:10:53,130
You can't contact me for the next 2 days

1499
01:10:53,155 --> 01:10:53,995
OK?

1500
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:55,257
Disconnect

1501
01:10:55,282 --> 01:10:56,482
Villain sir...Villain!

1502
01:10:56,624 --> 01:10:58,270
Uncle and I...

1503
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:00,030
Uncle?
No!

1504
01:11:01,389 --> 01:11:02,270
Uncle?

1505
01:11:02,295 --> 01:11:03,455
I'm talking to you!

1506
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:04,630
Uncle!

1507
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:06,430
What is it, uncle?

1508
01:11:07,159 --> 01:11:08,725
He is a good friend

1509
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,030
Super!
Didn't I tell you?

1510
01:11:10,086 --> 01:11:12,246
This is awesome!
Uncle has international links

1511
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:12,990
But...

1512
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,355
...he is my enemy now

1513
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:16,066
Tell us correctly
Is he an enemy or friend?

1514
01:11:16,091 --> 01:11:16,651
The truth

1515
01:11:16,792 --> 01:11:18,312
It's a long flashback

1516
01:11:18,454 --> 01:11:19,454
Come inside
Let's talk

1517
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:21,109
The tank top is super!
Where did you buy it?

1518
01:11:21,134 --> 01:11:22,254
Seasonal discounts

1519
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:38,590
Lot of memories

1520
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:42,150
Pappa, pappa, paaa!

1521
01:11:43,078 --> 01:11:44,158
Bye!

1522
01:11:44,371 --> 01:11:45,811
Bye!

1523
01:11:52,118 --> 01:11:52,861
Grandma!

1524
01:11:52,886 --> 01:11:54,212
I'm going to become a hero

1525
01:11:54,237 --> 01:11:55,025
See you! Mother!

1526
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:56,890
I'm going to become a villain

1527
01:11:58,765 --> 01:12:00,807
To trust good children...

1528
01:12:00,832 --> 01:12:02,712
Hello darling...

1529
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:04,079
Baby!

1530
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:06,030
I'm going to become MGR

1531
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:07,070
Grandma!

1532
01:12:07,095 --> 01:12:09,895
I'm going to become Nambiar

1533
01:12:10,885 --> 01:12:11,812
And just like that,

1534
01:12:11,837 --> 01:12:14,757
we took our bag and arrived at Madras

1535
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:17,506
I'm a child of your home...

1536
01:12:17,531 --> 01:12:18,691
Get out!
Let me in!

1537
01:12:18,798 --> 01:12:19,558
I...

1538
01:12:19,622 --> 01:12:21,382
didn't get any acting chances

1539
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:22,750
But, he...

1540
01:12:22,775 --> 01:12:25,175
I've dreamed of this for years
Keep rolling

1541
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:27,710
My dear god!
Who's this, praying to the road?

1542
01:12:27,865 --> 01:12:28,849
Stop Who are you?
Brother...

1543
01:12:28,874 --> 01:12:30,794
Steven Spielkumar asked me to meet him
Who?

1544
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:32,110
You don't know?

1545
01:12:32,165 --> 01:12:33,966
The box office hit 'It may dawn'...

1546
01:12:33,991 --> 01:12:35,031
The director of that movie

1547
01:12:35,056 --> 01:12:35,776
Brother...

1548
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:37,731
His next movie is titled
'Oh No! It's gone'...

1549
01:12:37,756 --> 01:12:39,116
Oh No! There is no such thing Move

1550
01:12:39,141 --> 01:12:40,723
Brother, if you don't let me in...

1551
01:12:40,748 --> 01:12:41,958
I'll lose my chance

1552
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,571
No chance

1553
01:12:43,596 --> 01:12:45,196
Oh No! It's gone!

1554
01:12:45,727 --> 01:12:47,047
You pushed me, didn't you!

1555
01:12:47,452 --> 01:12:49,012
This sphere...

1556
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:50,350
will spin for me one day

1557
01:12:50,436 --> 01:12:51,788
Leave or else...
I'll see you then

1558
01:12:51,813 --> 01:12:53,493
Wait for it
You stay there

1559
01:12:53,599 --> 01:12:55,241
I came with dreams

1560
01:12:55,266 --> 01:12:57,026
How dare you chase me away!

1561
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:00,550
One day, I'll become a great villain...

1562
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:02,430
and act in this studio

1563
01:13:03,101 --> 01:13:04,501
If not, my name isn't Ramdass

1564
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:06,910
Brother, one black tea please

1565
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:08,390
I'll be back!

1566
01:13:08,478 --> 01:13:09,918
I will!
Hey!

1567
01:13:10,165 --> 01:13:11,097
Will you come with us?

1568
01:13:11,122 --> 01:13:12,362
Where? To act as a villain?

1569
01:13:12,415 --> 01:13:13,355
To become a villain

1570
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:14,500
What? To what a villain?

1571
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:15,430
To become a villain?

1572
01:13:15,455 --> 01:13:16,206
Come on!

1573
01:13:16,231 --> 01:13:17,111
Come on!

1574
01:13:17,231 --> 01:13:18,311
Here or there?

1575
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:18,888
Here?

1576
01:13:18,913 --> 01:13:20,233
To act?

1577
01:13:20,415 --> 01:13:22,335
I will become a villain

1578
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:30,830
He joined them...

1579
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:33,270
Became a hired hand

1580
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:36,156
He progressed to become a thug

1581
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:40,710
He became the right hand

1582
01:13:43,525 --> 01:13:45,500
And that's how he became a don

1583
01:13:45,525 --> 01:13:46,485
And you?

1584
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:50,070
Jing jung jung jing...

1585
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:51,678
Jing jung jung jing...

1586
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,040
"I'm an automan..."

1587
01:14:15,065 --> 01:14:16,445
"I know all routes..."

1588
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:18,270
"A man of fair rates..."

1589
01:14:18,295 --> 01:14:19,894
"a friend of good folks..."

1590
01:14:19,919 --> 01:14:21,678
"a good singer..."

1591
01:14:21,703 --> 01:14:23,284
"a man from Gandhi's land..."

1592
01:14:23,309 --> 01:14:24,749
"a hunter if I take my spear..."

1593
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:26,470
"A brother to the meek..."

1594
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:29,279
"A man with a sympathetic heart..."

1595
01:14:29,304 --> 01:14:32,474
"A kinsman of poor..."

1596
01:14:32,499 --> 01:14:36,139
"I'm always a kinsman of the poor"

1597
01:14:39,304 --> 01:14:41,165
Do you drive autos?

1598
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:43,110
We thought you were a don

1599
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:45,750
I doubted it
when you said he was your uncle

1600
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:47,140
What were the sugarcane fields...

1601
01:14:47,165 --> 01:14:48,005
...commissioner's daughter...

1602
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:49,670
and that Kuruvi will die

1603
01:14:49,695 --> 01:14:50,335
Son!

1604
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,960
Haven't you watched 'Never Fear'?

1605
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,200
He had a power cut

1606
01:14:53,225 --> 01:14:54,345
He asked for the climax

1607
01:14:54,432 --> 01:14:55,392
I told him to come

1608
01:14:55,478 --> 01:14:57,549
Myskkin made an awesome movie

1609
01:14:57,574 --> 01:14:58,694
Haven't you watched it?

1610
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:00,041
But the knife, the blood was...
Welcome, dear

1611
01:15:00,066 --> 01:15:00,826
Leave it here
Have some soup

1612
01:15:00,851 --> 01:15:02,091
Soup
Oh yes

1613
01:15:02,709 --> 01:15:03,949
It'll taste good

1614
01:15:04,195 --> 01:15:05,635
Leave it here
Dear?

1615
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:07,900
Keep the knife aside
The kids might be scared

1616
01:15:07,925 --> 01:15:08,629
Go away or...

1617
01:15:08,654 --> 01:15:10,214
your mouth...
Son, son!

1618
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:11,039
Don't do it!

1619
01:15:11,064 --> 01:15:12,793
Are you and your wife kidding us?
No, no!

1620
01:15:12,818 --> 01:15:13,698
What the hell, dude!

1621
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:14,710
Son...

1622
01:15:15,263 --> 01:15:16,943
I maybe a funny hero...

1623
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:18,055
but he...

1624
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:19,052
is a real villain

1625
01:15:19,077 --> 01:15:21,560
I thought you were a rowdy
But you are a joker

1626
01:15:21,585 --> 01:15:23,505
And that tank top and wrap around of yours!

1627
01:15:23,567 --> 01:15:25,367
I'm going to split your head into two

1628
01:15:25,428 --> 01:15:26,771
Let it go

1629
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:27,950
Uncle!
Yes

1630
01:15:27,975 --> 01:15:29,535
You were childhood friends

1631
01:15:29,933 --> 01:15:32,053
You'll know his plus and minus

1632
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:33,750
When you were young...

1633
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:35,658
have you ever competed with him and won?

1634
01:15:35,683 --> 01:15:37,138
A competition...Son!

1635
01:15:37,487 --> 01:15:39,567
No such thing happened

1636
01:15:39,699 --> 01:15:41,535
No uncle
There must be something

1637
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,640
Think hard!

1638
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:44,870
What shall I think about?

1639
01:15:45,613 --> 01:15:46,121
Suji?

1640
01:15:46,146 --> 01:15:47,793
Mom and I are here, dad!

1641
01:15:47,818 --> 01:15:49,378
I'm scared daddy

1642
01:15:49,784 --> 01:15:50,510
Hey!

1643
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:51,550
It's me

1644
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:53,070
You heard?

1645
01:15:53,421 --> 01:15:55,181
Your wife and kid are here

1646
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:58,471
If even a speck of dust is moved...

1647
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:00,110
I'll cut it

1648
01:16:01,067 --> 01:16:03,467
Take your hand off

1649
01:16:03,565 --> 01:16:05,182
Scratching his bald head...

1650
01:16:05,207 --> 01:16:06,967
I've trimmed it down

1651
01:16:07,335 --> 01:16:08,335
Uncle!

1652
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:10,319
I have an idea

1653
01:16:10,538 --> 01:16:11,338
Son!

1654
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:12,510
I have an idea too

1655
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:13,550
Share it, share it...

1656
01:16:13,659 --> 01:16:14,510
You go first

1657
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:16,085
You are older...

1658
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:17,790
You go first
OK Here goes

1659
01:16:19,018 --> 01:16:20,027
When I was young...

1660
01:16:20,052 --> 01:16:21,332
When I was in class 5,

1661
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:22,378
When?

1662
01:16:22,403 --> 01:16:23,723
5th grade! 5th grade!

1663
01:16:26,504 --> 01:16:27,984
I studied all night and

1664
01:16:28,009 --> 01:16:29,889
when I saw the question paper...

1665
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:31,990
I knew all the answers

1666
01:16:33,103 --> 01:16:35,423
My favourite teacher, Malathi was there

1667
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:38,910
I was so happy

1668
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:42,070
I was ready to answer
and searched for my pen

1669
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:43,269
The pen was missing

1670
01:16:43,294 --> 01:16:44,134
Oh no!

1671
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,839
And then?

1672
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:46,660
When I looked for it...

1673
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,125
he had it

1674
01:16:48,391 --> 01:16:49,951
Gotcha!

1675
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:51,670
Baldy! Scram!

1676
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:52,683
What did you do?

1677
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:54,068
I was so angry

1678
01:16:54,093 --> 01:16:55,453
I didn't know what to do

1679
01:16:55,552 --> 01:16:57,672
The teacher was staring at me

1680
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,413
I thought deeply

1681
01:17:00,839 --> 01:17:03,319
Suddenly, I took his pen

1682
01:17:03,782 --> 01:17:04,640
And then?

1683
01:17:04,665 --> 01:17:05,625
What else?

1684
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:07,730
I told him to exchange the pens

1685
01:17:09,743 --> 01:17:10,695
He gave it back

1686
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,120
Super, Uncle!
Thank you

1687
01:17:12,366 --> 01:17:13,406
Dude!

1688
01:17:13,431 --> 01:17:15,391
What a stupid flashback
and why a super for this?

1689
01:17:15,416 --> 01:17:17,016
Swear on your mom that it was superb

1690
01:17:17,236 --> 01:17:18,316
Shhh!

1691
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:19,424
Uncle!

1692
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,120
It's the same pen story

1693
01:17:23,063 --> 01:17:24,883
What we are going to do is...

1694
01:17:24,908 --> 01:17:26,748
Like how he has kidnapped my girl...

1695
01:17:26,773 --> 01:17:29,013
I will kidnap his girl...

1696
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:31,992
we will demand my girl in exchange for his

1697
01:17:32,017 --> 01:17:33,057
He will do it

1698
01:17:33,082 --> 01:17:34,522
It can be excellently executed

1699
01:17:34,547 --> 01:17:36,227
What are you blabbering? Look!

1700
01:17:36,312 --> 01:17:37,112
But, son

1701
01:17:37,137 --> 01:17:38,417
There is a small problem

1702
01:17:38,442 --> 01:17:39,242
What is it, uncle?

1703
01:17:39,267 --> 01:17:40,387
He doesn't have a girl

1704
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,439
Wife?
No

1705
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:42,787
Mistress?
Nope

1706
01:17:42,812 --> 01:17:43,972
Who is there, then?

1707
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:44,717
Son,

1708
01:17:44,791 --> 01:17:46,911
he had a 'right hand' and a 'left hand'

1709
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:48,588
And they chopped one hand,

1710
01:17:48,613 --> 01:17:49,987
He eats and cleans with the same hand?

1711
01:17:50,012 --> 01:17:51,812
Not a hand, a human

1712
01:17:51,936 --> 01:17:53,816
They were Kaasi and Maasi

1713
01:17:53,841 --> 01:17:55,561
He won't do anything directly

1714
01:17:55,586 --> 01:17:56,786
These guys do it for him

1715
01:17:56,811 --> 01:17:58,051
And Maasi was slayed

1716
01:17:58,183 --> 01:17:59,243
Now, Kaasi, is his everything

1717
01:17:59,268 --> 01:18:00,680
So, we take Kaasi

1718
01:18:00,705 --> 01:18:01,545
Super!

1719
01:18:01,570 --> 01:18:02,539
Be right back

1720
01:18:02,564 --> 01:18:04,789
It's kidnapping
Not Karaoke Revolution

1721
01:18:04,814 --> 01:18:05,774
We can lose our lives

1722
01:18:05,966 --> 01:18:07,071
Dude, kidnapping is easy

1723
01:18:07,096 --> 01:18:08,216
How so?
Go straight to...

1724
01:18:08,241 --> 01:18:09,921
Burma bazaar
Store no 246

1725
01:18:10,008 --> 01:18:11,328
You'll find Sheikh Dawood there

1726
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:12,713
Who? Sleeper cell?

1727
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:14,390
I will slipper you

1728
01:18:14,415 --> 01:18:15,375
He owns a CD store

1729
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,520
Buy all the Tamil action movies

1730
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:18,199
Dude...

1731
01:18:18,224 --> 01:18:20,904
In this situation,
do you really want to watch movies?

1732
01:18:20,952 --> 01:18:22,432
Do as I say

1733
01:18:24,055 --> 01:18:24,986
Son...

1734
01:18:25,011 --> 01:18:26,291
I am ready

1735
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:27,682
Shall we go?

1736
01:18:27,707 --> 01:18:28,307
You!

1737
01:18:28,332 --> 01:18:29,044
What is this?

1738
01:18:29,069 --> 01:18:31,229
You said kidnapping
I'm in my action costume

1739
01:18:31,465 --> 01:18:32,054
How is it?

1740
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:33,436
Go change your clothes

1741
01:18:33,461 --> 01:18:34,021
But son...

1742
01:18:34,046 --> 01:18:35,526
I've bombs that I can throw

1743
01:18:35,688 --> 01:18:37,608
Throw it and I'll throw it back at you

1744
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:38,452
Go away

1745
01:18:38,477 --> 01:18:40,277
Why are you saying no to this?

1746
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:41,543
Dude!

1747
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:43,590
I don't even like ribbing him

1748
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:45,670
It's OK
Are we trusting him with this kidnapping?

1749
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:51,870
Manikkam,
It pokes

1750
01:18:53,501 --> 01:18:55,141
Careful
It might slip

1751
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:56,548
With a wig, you are Baasha

1752
01:18:56,635 --> 01:18:58,155
Without it, are you Alavanthaan?

1753
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,030
Switch it on

1754
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:05,070
Shall I?
Go ahead!

1755
01:19:09,943 --> 01:19:11,463
Don't hide it

1756
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:13,470
Ooooh!

1757
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:15,670
Dude! What is this!

1758
01:19:15,695 --> 01:19:16,759
I asked for action movies

1759
01:19:16,784 --> 01:19:18,824
He gave me all the action movies
Just change it

1760
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:21,689
It is good
Let's watch this

1761
01:19:21,714 --> 01:19:23,501
He is like your son

1762
01:19:23,526 --> 01:19:24,966
Will you watch porn with him?

1763
01:19:24,991 --> 01:19:26,271
I'll beat you!

1764
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:27,630
Change it

1765
01:19:34,026 --> 01:19:36,746
What is it? What happened to you?

1766
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:39,509
Who are you? What is this?

1767
01:19:39,534 --> 01:19:41,595
Everything has a reason
Shut up and get in the car

1768
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,820
The car? Please come

1769
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:40,150
To drink...

1770
01:20:48,775 --> 01:20:49,735
Van has come

1771
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:50,880
Come with me

1772
01:20:54,190 --> 01:20:56,430
Wake up, dear

1773
01:20:57,328 --> 01:20:58,728
It's the TV

1774
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:01,470
Did you get it?

1775
01:21:02,519 --> 01:21:04,239
Did you get it?
Yes it is, son!

1776
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:06,310
Go then

1777
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:08,630
Tell me...

1778
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:09,617
Dude...

1779
01:21:09,642 --> 01:21:11,562
I have an amazing plan

1780
01:21:11,587 --> 01:21:12,547
Tell me, tell me

1781
01:21:12,671 --> 01:21:13,831
I thought of it last night

1782
01:21:13,856 --> 01:21:15,210
You were sleeping so I didn't tell you

1783
01:21:15,235 --> 01:21:16,288
Super!
Follow me!

1784
01:21:16,313 --> 01:21:17,976
Tell me!

1785
01:21:18,468 --> 01:21:19,030
Dude!

1786
01:21:19,055 --> 01:21:21,460
It's already been one day
since the girls were kidnapped

1787
01:21:21,485 --> 01:21:24,125
I don't know what that caveman Godfather
did to them...

1788
01:21:24,175 --> 01:21:26,695
My girl is already thinking of breaking up

1789
01:21:26,743 --> 01:21:27,906
Tell now!

1790
01:21:27,931 --> 01:21:29,327
Let Uncle come

1791
01:21:29,352 --> 01:21:30,992
Unc...Uncle!

1792
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:32,840
Uncle! That's enough Come

1793
01:21:32,865 --> 01:21:33,985
I'm done!
Get out now!

1794
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:36,210
Do you need to go urgently?
Get out

1795
01:21:36,991 --> 01:21:38,711
I use my right hand, son

1796
01:21:38,783 --> 01:21:40,143
Move it
What now?

1797
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:42,439
Woah woah woah!

1798
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:44,715
Son...
Why are you behaving strangely?

1799
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:46,565
You don't behave like this

1800
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:47,590
Tell me

1801
01:21:47,645 --> 01:21:49,076
Will you tell or shall I jump?
Wait, wait!

1802
01:21:49,101 --> 01:21:50,075
Wait

1803
01:21:50,191 --> 01:21:50,871
Why tension?

1804
01:21:50,896 --> 01:21:52,896
Uncle...Yes I'm here
Come here

1805
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:54,830
Tell

1806
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:58,475
Dude! Look around

1807
01:21:58,544 --> 01:22:00,864
There's no one
It won't be heard even if you shout it

1808
01:22:02,942 --> 01:22:04,902
We are going to kidnap by drugging him

1809
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:06,150
I'll kill myself
Wait!

1810
01:22:06,175 --> 01:22:07,815
What?
It's a great plan

1811
01:22:07,894 --> 01:22:09,558
It can be excellently executed

1812
01:22:09,709 --> 01:22:11,109
That's an old plan

1813
01:22:11,244 --> 01:22:12,484
What is this, dude...

1814
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:15,110
All of Tamil cinema has this scene

1815
01:22:15,165 --> 01:22:16,125
Trust that it will work

1816
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:17,550
Yeah!

1817
01:22:17,969 --> 01:22:19,484
Where will you buy it?
Good question

1818
01:22:19,509 --> 01:22:20,629
The movies didn't say that

1819
01:22:20,654 --> 01:22:22,719
We don't have to, either
Good question, too

1820
01:22:22,744 --> 01:22:24,485
Whether you use drugs...

1821
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:26,961
or whether you split his head with a rod

1822
01:22:26,986 --> 01:22:28,186
I need you to kidnap him

1823
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:29,770
The second idea is also good

1824
01:22:29,795 --> 01:22:30,835
Dude!

1825
01:22:30,935 --> 01:22:34,015
I told you not to watch movies all night

1826
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:35,590
My son You silent

1827
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:37,039
When shall we?

1828
01:22:37,064 --> 01:22:38,064
and how?

1829
01:22:38,151 --> 01:22:39,537
There is something important to do

1830
01:22:39,562 --> 01:22:40,642
Please tell me

1831
01:22:40,858 --> 01:22:42,298
Retards!

1832
01:22:43,626 --> 01:22:45,346
"Kaasi"

1833
01:22:48,398 --> 01:22:50,998
I've told you not to pee in bed!

1834
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:57,175
- Darling
- Tea

1835
01:22:57,246 --> 01:22:59,286
How do you poop so many times?

1836
01:23:00,512 --> 01:23:01,392
I say, that's enough!

1837
01:23:01,486 --> 01:23:03,436
If you mess with me, that's it!

1838
01:23:03,461 --> 01:23:04,861
Kaasi, where's your wife?

1839
01:23:04,886 --> 01:23:06,086
Why are you carrying water?

1840
01:23:06,111 --> 01:23:08,511
Hey! Why do you always
take a dump near my house?

1841
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,045
So what, Devi?
It's not in your house

1842
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:11,430
Did you take a photo?

1843
01:23:11,662 --> 01:23:13,262
Be careful Else they'll figure it out

1844
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:16,172
Hello there
Are you from another city?

1845
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:17,078
We are foreigners

1846
01:23:17,103 --> 01:23:18,143
Sightseeing...

1847
01:23:18,254 --> 01:23:21,092
A thank you for that
glance you gave me

1848
01:23:21,117 --> 01:23:22,287
Dad?

1849
01:23:22,312 --> 01:23:24,152
Are you acting like
in yesterday's movie?

1850
01:23:24,177 --> 01:23:25,790
That was nothing, son

1851
01:23:25,815 --> 01:23:27,112
There was something
on mom's face...

1852
01:23:27,137 --> 01:23:30,105
Wipe it off with your hands
Why use your mouth?

1853
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:41,487
Hey! Open the door

1854
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:43,832
OK See you tomorrow

1855
01:23:51,464 --> 01:23:52,464
Well?

1856
01:23:52,543 --> 01:23:54,463
You have been standing all day

1857
01:23:54,678 --> 01:23:56,281
I beg you to share your plan

1858
01:23:56,306 --> 01:23:58,186
Nice shirt
Keep quiet

1859
01:23:58,630 --> 01:23:59,510
Thank you

1860
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:00,439
OK

1861
01:24:00,681 --> 01:24:03,510
From 10am to 10pm,
Kaasi is very busy

1862
01:24:03,565 --> 01:24:05,735
from 10pm to 12AM, he's at his mistress

1863
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,360
After 12AM, he goes home

1864
01:24:07,416 --> 01:24:08,496
Two broads - one night?

1865
01:24:08,559 --> 01:24:09,679
Are you jealous?

1866
01:24:09,704 --> 01:24:10,904
No
OK

1867
01:24:11,286 --> 01:24:13,218
And it is then, that he is alone

1868
01:24:13,243 --> 01:24:15,460
There'll be people at other times

1869
01:24:15,485 --> 01:24:16,765
But why is he alone now?

1870
01:24:16,790 --> 01:24:19,750
Because, the broad he was with,
eloped with his friend

1871
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:21,990
Oh! Nice

1872
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,950
So our kidnapping point
is Arunachalam road

1873
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:28,928
The darkest hour

1874
01:24:28,953 --> 01:24:30,390
A yellow light

1875
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:32,550
Wearing a red shirt,
he walks out of the dark

1876
01:24:32,575 --> 01:24:33,710
He walks
Yes

1877
01:24:34,257 --> 01:24:35,977
Far away is an auto

1878
01:24:36,002 --> 01:24:37,882
Uncle in front You and I behind

1879
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:40,101
The handkerchief
is in my hand

1880
01:24:40,126 --> 01:24:41,926
After he comes out of the dark

1881
01:24:41,984 --> 01:24:44,704
Uncle will slowly drive next to him

1882
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:49,665
I will pass through the air and
hold the handkerchief to his nose

1883
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:51,530
He faints
We lift

1884
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:52,594
Super!

1885
01:24:52,619 --> 01:24:54,139
Great plan!
Yes!

1886
01:24:55,481 --> 01:24:57,173
This is a plan from
the Jaishanker decade

1887
01:24:57,198 --> 01:24:58,894
Dude, this is
a terrible plan

1888
01:24:58,919 --> 01:25:00,496
It will work
Wait and watch

1889
01:25:00,626 --> 01:25:01,186
Son

1890
01:25:01,211 --> 01:25:03,378
This plan will definitely work

1891
01:25:03,403 --> 01:25:04,996
You! Change your
costume first

1892
01:25:05,021 --> 01:25:05,941
To what?

1893
01:25:05,966 --> 01:25:06,722
Is it Baasha?

1894
01:25:06,747 --> 01:25:07,667
or Padayappa?

1895
01:25:07,692 --> 01:25:08,660
Kattappa

1896
01:25:08,685 --> 01:25:10,136
Bahubali Kattappa

1897
01:25:10,161 --> 01:25:11,241
How?

1898
01:25:11,968 --> 01:25:12,925
Like this

1899
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:14,150
Like this?

1900
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:20,390
That's all dandy

1901
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:21,642
But when you observe this

1902
01:25:21,667 --> 01:25:23,370
Feels like Mysskin Movie

1903
01:25:23,672 --> 01:25:25,392
It's not like a Mysskin movie

1904
01:25:25,417 --> 01:25:26,417
It is a Mysskin movie

1905
01:25:26,442 --> 01:25:28,922
Cut to camera above
a street light

1906
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:34,710
What pa?

1907
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:36,430
He will come

1908
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:45,590
Uncle! He's coming

1909
01:25:45,684 --> 01:25:46,724
Start the vehicle

1910
01:25:47,895 --> 01:25:49,535
Why are you pumping it?

1911
01:25:52,287 --> 01:25:53,167
What are you doing?

1912
01:25:53,192 --> 01:25:53,912
Son,

1913
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:55,264
I think we've run out of gas

1914
01:25:55,289 --> 01:25:56,529
What? No petrol?

1915
01:25:56,670 --> 01:25:57,350
What are you saying?

1916
01:25:57,375 --> 01:25:58,719
I gave it for service

1917
01:25:58,744 --> 01:26:01,064
I've got a mileage of 40km

1918
01:26:01,799 --> 01:26:03,719
How are we doing this?
Don't stress it

1919
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:04,881
I've bought it in a can

1920
01:26:04,906 --> 01:26:06,586
You guys are funny

1921
01:26:08,043 --> 01:26:10,163
Tell your aunt to divorce him
He's here

1922
01:26:16,342 --> 01:26:17,382
Uncle!

1923
01:26:17,501 --> 01:26:18,701
Come quickly

1924
01:26:19,247 --> 01:26:20,167
Hey!

1925
01:26:21,295 --> 01:26:23,495
Ready Shall we?
Move it

1926
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:28,870
Uncle!

1927
01:26:28,895 --> 01:26:30,178
Drive! Go closer!

1928
01:26:30,203 --> 01:26:31,563
I am! I am!
Quickly!

1929
01:26:31,588 --> 01:26:33,061
Faster! Faster!

1930
01:26:33,086 --> 01:26:33,926
Don't stress it

1931
01:26:34,245 --> 01:26:35,928
Ready, uncle?

1932
01:26:35,953 --> 01:26:37,313
Dude! Go!

1933
01:26:42,303 --> 01:26:43,760
What happened?

1934
01:26:43,808 --> 01:26:45,688
You messed it
Keep driving!

1935
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:48,489
Drive! Drive!
I am! I am!

1936
01:26:48,514 --> 01:26:49,504
The auto is choking

1937
01:26:49,529 --> 01:26:51,449
Dude! Uncle! Drive faster!

1938
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:53,430
What?
Why is it stopping?

1939
01:26:53,455 --> 01:26:55,055
Hey! He's here! On no!

1940
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:57,629
Baldy!

1941
01:26:57,654 --> 01:26:58,908
Hey! I'm asking you stop the auto

1942
01:26:58,933 --> 01:27:00,573
We're sorry we tried
to kidnap you!

1943
01:27:00,793 --> 01:27:02,193
What? Kidnap me?!

1944
01:27:02,335 --> 01:27:03,655
I came to catch the auto

1945
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:04,994
How dare you try to kidnap me!

1946
01:27:05,055 --> 01:27:07,251
I'm gonna
Not me It wasn't me!

1947
01:27:07,276 --> 01:27:08,415
Hey!
Hey Abbas!

1948
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:09,400
It's all because of you

1949
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:12,598
Why are you crying? Drive faster

1950
01:27:12,623 --> 01:27:13,302
OK

1951
01:27:13,327 --> 01:27:15,536
Why were you trying to kidnap me?

1952
01:27:15,569 --> 01:27:17,147
Brother

1953
01:27:17,172 --> 01:27:18,174
Just a minute

1954
01:27:19,857 --> 01:27:21,564
I'm embarrassed

1955
01:27:21,589 --> 01:27:22,405
Hey!

1956
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:23,925
I don't know why I came along
Hey!

1957
01:27:23,965 --> 01:27:25,659
Uncle! He fainted!

1958
01:27:25,684 --> 01:27:27,444
Oh joy!!

1959
01:27:35,191 --> 01:27:36,420
Gemini Ganesh!

1960
01:27:36,445 --> 01:27:37,325
Come out!

1961
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:38,193
Hey Abbas!

1962
01:27:38,218 --> 01:27:40,018
Get out!
What's with him? What is he doing?

1963
01:27:40,043 --> 01:27:42,123
I'll check Kattappa!
You got me beaten up!

1964
01:27:42,148 --> 01:27:43,148
What is it?

1965
01:27:43,272 --> 01:27:44,352
Come!
Why shouting?

1966
01:27:44,377 --> 01:27:45,257
Hey kids!

1967
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:47,190
Do you know how big a thug I am?

1968
01:27:47,621 --> 01:27:50,741
I wanted to be a hero, because in movies,
the villain gets beaten up

1969
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:52,510
But you got me beaten up

1970
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:53,910
Don't ever come home

1971
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:55,171
If you do, I'll divorce your aunt

1972
01:27:55,196 --> 01:27:57,388
I'll kill you
Got it?

1973
01:27:57,413 --> 01:27:57,999
Yes?

1974
01:27:58,024 --> 01:27:58,904
Who is it?

1975
01:28:02,047 --> 01:28:03,047
Dude, call him

1976
01:28:03,671 --> 01:28:04,511
Hey!

1977
01:28:04,536 --> 01:28:05,256
Hey!

1978
01:28:05,281 --> 01:28:07,201
I've kidnapped you
but you are napping

1979
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:12,910
Where's your right hand?

1980
01:28:12,935 --> 01:28:14,295
Here Right here

1981
01:28:15,055 --> 01:28:16,095
Where's Kaasi?

1982
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:18,332
That's near Haridwar

1983
01:28:18,357 --> 01:28:19,394
This falls flat

1984
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:20,819
- Where's your right
- Kaasi?

1985
01:28:21,636 --> 01:28:22,470
Kaasi...

1986
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:23,203
Kaasi...

1987
01:28:23,228 --> 01:28:24,028
Kaasi...

1988
01:28:28,688 --> 01:28:30,288
Here's Kaasi

1989
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:32,859
Godfather! I've been kidnapped

1990
01:28:32,884 --> 01:28:35,284
Save me, Godfather! Please!
Enough!

1991
01:28:35,790 --> 01:28:36,510
Kaasi!

1992
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:38,510
Son, don't hurt Kaasi

1993
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:41,110
I've already lost Maasi Please!

1994
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:46,350
If my girl gets a small scratch,
you will not see your guy alive

1995
01:28:50,128 --> 01:28:51,168
Give that phone!

1996
01:28:51,193 --> 01:28:52,473
Hello? Moron!

1997
01:28:52,498 --> 01:28:55,778
When you told him not to hurt me
that's when he hit me

1998
01:28:55,803 --> 01:28:57,363
I know how to handle this

1999
01:28:57,388 --> 01:28:58,508
You shut up

2000
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:00,350
Thank you
Welcome

2001
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:04,493
Dude! Untie him

2002
01:29:04,518 --> 01:29:06,238
Let her they
Untie him!

2003
01:29:06,263 --> 01:29:07,423
What happened?

2004
01:29:07,486 --> 01:29:10,326
He's hitting her after
we threatened to kill him

2005
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:12,788
He's not worth that much
Untie him

2006
01:29:12,813 --> 01:29:14,668
What did you say, son?
What do you mean?

2007
01:29:14,768 --> 01:29:17,128
Hey! Don't talk
Leave

2008
01:29:17,153 --> 01:29:17,993
Get lost!

2009
01:29:19,167 --> 01:29:20,527
Why did I kidnap him?

2010
01:29:20,552 --> 01:29:21,992
Son, pass the phone

2011
01:29:22,086 --> 01:29:23,101
Use your phone

2012
01:29:23,175 --> 01:29:24,562
Son, I don't have
talk time balance

2013
01:29:24,587 --> 01:29:25,947
Give me your phone

2014
01:29:26,047 --> 01:29:27,247
Have fun!

2015
01:29:28,375 --> 01:29:29,455
What happened?

2016
01:29:29,565 --> 01:29:30,254
Dude!

2017
01:29:30,279 --> 01:29:31,839
She's swearing at me

2018
01:29:31,864 --> 01:29:33,424
Did she talk about family?
Yes

2019
01:29:33,449 --> 01:29:35,849
About my family?
She couldn't stop

2020
01:29:35,959 --> 01:29:36,879
Hey Attu!

2021
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:37,824
Where are you?

2022
01:29:37,849 --> 01:29:38,569
Yes, chief...

2023
01:29:38,594 --> 01:29:41,154
He started hitting her after
you threatened to kill him

2024
01:29:41,179 --> 01:29:41,834
You heard that?

2025
01:29:41,859 --> 01:29:44,619
I think that how Maasi was murdered
What!

2026
01:29:44,809 --> 01:29:47,129
Did Godfather kill
my friend Maasi?

2027
01:29:54,742 --> 01:29:56,542
Uncle! Hello, uncle?
Yes son Go on

2028
01:29:57,015 --> 01:29:57,943
Uncle, where is dad?

2029
01:29:57,968 --> 01:29:59,488
He stepped out
What is it?

2030
01:29:59,523 --> 01:30:01,443
You need to take someone out
Right now!

2031
01:30:01,608 --> 01:30:03,608
What happened?
He threw acid on my friend

2032
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:05,073
Will you end it or shall I?

2033
01:30:05,098 --> 01:30:06,698
Son, be patient

2034
01:30:06,849 --> 01:30:07,847
How did he look?

2035
01:30:07,872 --> 01:30:09,952
His look height and weight
and aged between 38-40

2036
01:30:10,041 --> 01:30:11,063
Scar on his face, well built

2037
01:30:11,088 --> 01:30:12,848
white beard
Which area?

2038
01:30:12,873 --> 01:30:14,688
Vyasarpadi
I'll handle it

2039
01:30:14,713 --> 01:30:16,473
Never ever leave those

2040
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:18,431
Son You've told it to me

2041
01:30:18,643 --> 01:30:20,003
I'll deal with it

2042
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:23,470
Who's the gang in your area
that does acid attacks?

2043
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,160
It's our Maasi

2044
01:30:29,988 --> 01:30:31,171
He just returned from jail

2045
01:30:31,196 --> 01:30:32,716
That gang does acid
attacks sometimes

2046
01:30:32,784 --> 01:30:35,504
After you take him down,
come home and collect 10

2047
01:30:37,232 --> 01:30:38,906
Hello
Is Maasi on duty?

2048
01:30:38,943 --> 01:30:39,703
Yes

2049
01:30:39,728 --> 01:30:40,968
He's touched a big place

2050
01:30:40,993 --> 01:30:41,713
A big place?

2051
01:30:41,738 --> 01:30:43,738
Take him down
I'll send 10

2052
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:50,640
Hey!

2053
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:55,951
Maasi...

2054
01:30:58,302 --> 01:31:00,382
Who's with Maasi?
Attu

2055
01:31:01,014 --> 01:31:03,694
Call Attu and...tell
him to take down Maasi

2056
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:04,439
Why?

2057
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:07,092
He planned to kill me

2058
01:31:08,126 --> 01:31:09,926
Hello?
Attu

2059
01:31:10,005 --> 01:31:10,981
Where are you?

2060
01:31:11,006 --> 01:31:12,686
There's a guy chasing us with a gun

2061
01:31:12,735 --> 01:31:14,295
Chasing with a gun?

2062
01:31:14,327 --> 01:31:15,727
Is Maasi with you?

2063
01:31:15,752 --> 01:31:16,407
Yeah

2064
01:31:16,432 --> 01:31:17,912
Take him down

2065
01:31:18,110 --> 01:31:19,430
What?

2066
01:31:19,517 --> 01:31:21,317
He's tried to kill Brother

2067
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:23,550
He said so

2068
01:31:23,590 --> 01:31:24,430
So, finish him

2069
01:31:24,822 --> 01:31:25,424
Hey...

2070
01:31:25,449 --> 01:31:27,853
Who is that?
Hang it the phone

2071
01:31:28,716 --> 01:31:29,716
OK brother

2072
01:31:38,736 --> 01:31:40,136
Did you kill my friend Maasi?

2073
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:40,801
Bro! Bro!

2074
01:31:40,826 --> 01:31:42,736
Brother!
Kaasi, let it go I didn't kill Maasi!

2075
01:31:42,761 --> 01:31:43,541
That was him

2076
01:31:43,566 --> 01:31:44,686
Brother, please
listen to me

2077
01:31:44,711 --> 01:31:46,556
Wait! He's trying to say something
Let him speak

2078
01:31:46,581 --> 01:31:48,854
I killed Maasi because
he tried to kill Godfather

2079
01:31:48,879 --> 01:31:50,239
You would've done the same

2080
01:31:50,335 --> 01:31:52,323
I didn't know it was
for money until later

2081
01:31:52,348 --> 01:31:54,068
That's why I confessed now
Let go!

2082
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:55,750
Yes

2083
01:31:57,845 --> 01:32:01,805
My friend Maasi and I,
planned to kill Godfather

2084
01:32:01,853 --> 01:32:03,213
But Maasi got caught

2085
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:06,620
I will avenge Maasi and
won't stop until I kill Godfather

2086
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:07,931
With my hands!

2087
01:32:07,956 --> 01:32:09,196
Brother! Brother!
Godfather!

2088
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:12,416
We are leaving tonight
for Maaru's wedding

2089
01:32:12,441 --> 01:32:14,481
Godfather will be alone
Finish him!

2090
01:32:14,506 --> 01:32:15,826
Death by my hands!

2091
01:32:15,851 --> 01:32:17,251
Godfather will die in my hands

2092
01:32:17,276 --> 01:32:18,393
Son! Do you have a billhook?

2093
01:32:18,426 --> 01:32:20,719
Do you have it? A gun maybe?

2094
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:22,925
Godfather will die in my hands

2095
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:24,163
What should we do with him?

2096
01:32:24,208 --> 01:32:26,168
Get him booze, He'll be OK

2097
01:32:27,879 --> 01:32:29,439
Hey! What's your drink?

2098
01:32:33,143 --> 01:32:35,110
Maasi

2099
01:32:39,096 --> 01:32:43,336
After Vineet and Abbas
in movie 'Kadhal Desam'

2100
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:46,950
Were you very good friends?

2101
01:32:47,407 --> 01:32:48,807
Where do I start?

2102
01:32:48,886 --> 01:32:50,246
It's not a simple friendship

2103
01:32:50,271 --> 01:32:52,271
We've had it for generations

2104
01:32:52,318 --> 01:32:54,318
Oh! Generation after generation?

2105
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:57,830
My mom and his mom were thick friends

2106
01:32:58,064 --> 01:33:00,864
My grandma and his grandma
were also thick friends

2107
01:33:01,518 --> 01:33:02,589
Were you neighbours?

2108
01:33:02,614 --> 01:33:03,494
No, no

2109
01:33:03,792 --> 01:33:05,752
You lived in the same neighbourhood?
No, No...

2110
01:33:05,777 --> 01:33:07,017
Then how?

2111
01:33:07,738 --> 01:33:09,777
They were working together

2112
01:33:09,802 --> 01:33:10,620
What is the nature of work?

2113
01:33:10,645 --> 01:33:12,160
Prostitution
Yuck!

2114
01:33:12,185 --> 01:33:13,305
Are you guys 'the bass turds'?

2115
01:33:13,368 --> 01:33:15,128
How dare you ask me that!
How can I not?

2116
01:33:15,153 --> 01:33:16,033
Dude! Let it go

2117
01:33:16,817 --> 01:33:18,777
Brother, I've a small doubt

2118
01:33:18,856 --> 01:33:20,776
Son, it's not like this right

2119
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:24,630
No, bro I'm dating my girl for 2 years now

2120
01:33:25,321 --> 01:33:28,321
Just kissing and
that's all we've done

2121
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:32,079
Godfather has her
for two days now

2122
01:33:32,104 --> 01:33:33,824
He wouldn't have
done anything right?

2123
01:33:33,849 --> 01:33:35,009
Oh stop it, son

2124
01:33:35,034 --> 01:33:36,733
Tell me, man!
My heart's racing

2125
01:33:36,758 --> 01:33:37,718
I told you to stop it

2126
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:40,062
Son, you pour
Will you answer or pay up for the drink?

2127
01:33:40,087 --> 01:33:41,163
How dare you say that!

2128
01:33:41,188 --> 01:33:42,348
My girl is also kidnapped

2129
01:33:42,373 --> 01:33:43,693
Answer
Answer

2130
01:33:44,108 --> 01:33:45,188
I will, son

2131
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:47,287
A few days ago,

2132
01:33:47,312 --> 01:33:49,072
it was an English movie

2133
01:33:49,670 --> 01:33:52,076
Like the villain in that film,

2134
01:33:52,101 --> 01:33:55,501
he kidnapped many women
No! No no

2135
01:33:55,607 --> 01:33:57,087
and raped them

2136
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:01,030
Let me go!

2137
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:10,990
What are you saying? Rape?

2138
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:12,095
Why is he saying rape?

2139
01:34:12,128 --> 01:34:15,288
Please don't do anything
to my girl, Godfather!

2140
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:16,564
Hey! Hey!

2141
01:34:16,589 --> 01:34:17,638
My girl looks like a troll

2142
01:34:17,663 --> 01:34:18,743
I am never turned on by her

2143
01:34:18,768 --> 01:34:20,118
How can he rape her?

2144
01:34:20,143 --> 01:34:21,223
Son, son, son

2145
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:22,390
I'm not done

2146
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:24,470
One day

2147
01:34:25,022 --> 01:34:26,462
He didn't get any broad

2148
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:28,350
One butt ugly gal

2149
01:34:28,451 --> 01:34:30,154
We tried to stop him

2150
01:34:30,179 --> 01:34:31,939
Brother, no no

2151
01:34:32,466 --> 01:34:33,190
But

2152
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:35,162
He pushed us all out
Get out!

2153
01:34:35,187 --> 01:34:37,209
and closed the door

2154
01:34:38,359 --> 01:34:41,119
Suddenly a loud sound -
Ahhh!!

2155
01:34:41,710 --> 01:34:44,790
When we ran to
see what it was

2156
01:34:50,086 --> 01:34:52,766
We all thought he hurt his chest

2157
01:34:52,830 --> 01:34:55,630
But he didn't hurt his chest, son

2158
01:34:55,670 --> 01:34:56,711
Gak!

2159
01:34:56,736 --> 01:34:57,990
Then?
What else

2160
01:34:58,015 --> 01:35:01,895
He fell that day
and never rose again

2161
01:35:02,026 --> 01:35:03,579
What a disgusting man - that Godfather!

2162
01:35:03,604 --> 01:35:06,126
"Oh genius
Come win me over"

2163
01:35:06,174 --> 01:35:09,439
"To have met you is a blessing"

2164
01:35:14,023 --> 01:35:15,703
Hey, untie me and watch

2165
01:35:15,728 --> 01:35:18,008
I dance better than her

2166
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:21,630
Nope I like Nayanthara

2167
01:35:23,670 --> 01:35:24,546
Hey!

2168
01:35:24,571 --> 01:35:26,931
Don't you ever get turned on?

2169
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:30,150
What are you saying!

2170
01:35:30,488 --> 01:35:32,848
Let's see if he tries to rape

2171
01:35:32,928 --> 01:35:34,048
There's just one guy

2172
01:35:34,073 --> 01:35:35,793
We can beat him up and run

2173
01:35:35,950 --> 01:35:37,830
Idiot!

2174
01:35:42,008 --> 01:35:42,969
How long have you worked for him?

2175
01:35:42,994 --> 01:35:44,820
Now that you ask that, son
No!

2176
01:35:44,845 --> 01:35:46,365
Not another flashback!

2177
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:47,931
I'm watching you
You are talkative

2178
01:35:47,995 --> 01:35:48,915
Tell us the plan

2179
01:35:48,969 --> 01:35:50,969
I need a sketch pen
and a chart

2180
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:53,910
Come inside
We have a set up

2181
01:36:02,670 --> 01:36:04,086
You draw well, brother

2182
01:36:04,111 --> 01:36:05,111
Were you an artist?

2183
01:36:05,185 --> 01:36:07,425
Yes, son I drew Anjaneyar on the streets

2184
01:36:07,543 --> 01:36:09,303
You begged for change?

2185
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:23,735
If you bend like Vijay
"Kaththi" movie I will kick you

2186
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:25,560
It comes more movies
Enough

2187
01:36:25,585 --> 01:36:27,505
What happened, son?
I'll be back

2188
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:32,481
Son

2189
01:36:32,506 --> 01:36:33,946
This is Godfather's house

2190
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:35,606
His front entrance

2191
01:36:35,631 --> 01:36:36,511
The back entrance

2192
01:36:36,536 --> 01:36:38,296
So we enter through the back

2193
01:36:38,447 --> 01:36:39,887
A good man uses the front door

2194
01:36:39,912 --> 01:36:40,712
He's a criminal

2195
01:36:40,737 --> 01:36:42,057
He uses the back door

2196
01:36:42,082 --> 01:36:44,522
So, we enter through the front door

2197
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:46,265
When you go straight and turn right

2198
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:46,890
And?

2199
01:36:46,915 --> 01:36:48,355
Nothing
It's a wall

2200
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:51,300
So, we take a left and then a right
and reach an entry

2201
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:53,614
There will be a shelf there

2202
01:36:53,639 --> 01:36:55,839
The shelf will have a beautiful Pillayar

2203
01:36:56,014 --> 01:36:57,214
Pillayar?

2204
01:36:59,102 --> 01:37:03,277
Stand there and pray for
the success of your task

2205
01:37:03,302 --> 01:37:07,222
When the pace is set won't
praying ruin the action mood?

2206
01:37:07,304 --> 01:37:09,024
Son, This is my plan

2207
01:37:09,088 --> 01:37:10,248
I will pray

2208
01:37:10,303 --> 01:37:11,743
Shall I continue or not?

2209
01:37:11,838 --> 01:37:13,518
Dude, it's just Pillayar We'll pray

2210
01:37:13,543 --> 01:37:14,192
Continue

2211
01:37:14,217 --> 01:37:16,817
A left from there
will take you to a room

2212
01:37:16,842 --> 01:37:18,882
Inside that room
is the toilet

2213
01:37:18,959 --> 01:37:20,999
You enter the toilet
Dude!

2214
01:37:21,094 --> 01:37:23,340
You asked us to pray OK!
Should we go inside the toilet?

2215
01:37:23,365 --> 01:37:25,026
But it hasn't come yet
Why should we go?

2216
01:37:25,051 --> 01:37:26,891
Even if it doesn't come,
you should go

2217
01:37:26,967 --> 01:37:28,247
When you see inside

2218
01:37:28,272 --> 01:37:30,152
There will be a hole
Gross!

2219
01:37:30,191 --> 01:37:32,291
Since you've arrived
all you say is toilet and hole

2220
01:37:32,316 --> 01:37:33,362
Dude, let's abort this plan

2221
01:37:33,387 --> 01:37:34,282
Son, son, son!

2222
01:37:34,307 --> 01:37:36,467
I'm not talking about
the hole in the ground

2223
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:37,950
There's a hole on the wall

2224
01:37:38,568 --> 01:37:39,848
Exhaust fan?
No, son

2225
01:37:39,873 --> 01:37:41,033
It's at about your height

2226
01:37:41,227 --> 01:37:42,628
Why a hole in the wall?
Son...

2227
01:37:42,653 --> 01:37:45,213
I already told you that Godfather
rapes from time to time

2228
01:37:45,238 --> 01:37:46,158
How do we know that?

2229
01:37:46,183 --> 01:37:47,303
We watched through it

2230
01:37:47,337 --> 01:37:48,697
You flea bags watched live sex?

2231
01:37:48,722 --> 01:37:50,042
Son!
Dishonorable!

2232
01:37:50,151 --> 01:37:52,271
The hole that we made then,
is now useful for you

2233
01:37:52,296 --> 01:37:53,656
Understand?

2234
01:37:53,743 --> 01:37:55,423
Let it go
Please go on

2235
01:37:55,448 --> 01:37:59,970
When you see through that hole
you'll see Godfather and the girls...

2236
01:37:59,995 --> 01:38:02,035
...and gather other details

2237
01:38:03,790 --> 01:38:04,646
Next!

2238
01:38:04,671 --> 01:38:05,511
Son...?

2239
01:38:05,591 --> 01:38:06,991
Who is the hero of this movie?

2240
01:38:07,766 --> 01:38:08,451
Me!

2241
01:38:08,476 --> 01:38:10,556
If I do everything,
why the hell are you here?

2242
01:38:10,609 --> 01:38:11,304
Scram!
What!

2243
01:38:11,399 --> 01:38:12,399
Idiots

2244
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:15,230
Brother

2245
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:19,150
I'll save my girl and throw
Godfather at your feet

2246
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:20,835
Come!

2247
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:22,220
Son, Son!
One minute

2248
01:38:22,245 --> 01:38:23,565
That toilet,

2249
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:27,032
Check for a key in the first drawer

2250
01:38:27,057 --> 01:38:28,497
Else check in the second drawer

2251
01:38:28,522 --> 01:38:30,442
If not, check the cupboard

2252
01:38:30,467 --> 01:38:31,267
Look there

2253
01:38:31,292 --> 01:38:33,012
Son, search the room

2254
01:38:33,037 --> 01:38:33,917
Find the key

2255
01:38:33,961 --> 01:38:34,686
Don't forget

2256
01:38:34,711 --> 01:38:36,391
Is that the key to Godfather's room?

2257
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,936
Nah That's my house key

2258
01:38:37,992 --> 01:38:39,312
I forgot it there

2259
01:38:39,337 --> 01:38:40,937
If you bring it and drop me home

2260
01:38:40,962 --> 01:38:42,802
I don't have to unnecessarily travel

2261
01:38:42,943 --> 01:38:43,823
Come!
Come!

2262
01:38:48,071 --> 01:38:49,071
Yes, auntie?

2263
01:38:49,096 --> 01:38:51,256
Where is your uncle?
I haven't seen him in 2 days

2264
01:38:51,441 --> 01:38:53,200
Uncle is dead
Don't you know?

2265
01:38:53,225 --> 01:38:54,545
What! Oh my god!
Yes, auntie

2266
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:56,370
You can collect his body from GH tomorrow

2267
01:38:56,395 --> 01:38:58,435
Good night Sweet dreams
But I sent him with you...

2268
01:38:58,750 --> 01:39:00,110
What are you saying?

2269
01:39:00,582 --> 01:39:02,182
Who is that?
Aunt

2270
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:03,160
Come

2271
01:39:06,832 --> 01:39:07,512
Dude!

2272
01:39:07,537 --> 01:39:08,897
The front or back entrance?

2273
01:39:09,439 --> 01:39:10,199
Back entrance

2274
01:39:10,224 --> 01:39:11,544
No, the front
No, the back

2275
01:39:11,569 --> 01:39:12,769
No, the front
Where's the map?

2276
01:39:12,910 --> 01:39:14,030
I'll get it from the car

2277
01:39:14,392 --> 01:39:15,592
I've the map in my mind

2278
01:39:15,694 --> 01:39:16,254
It's the back

2279
01:39:16,279 --> 01:39:17,239
The front
The back

2280
01:39:17,264 --> 01:39:18,024
The front
The back

2281
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:19,079
The back
The back

2282
01:39:19,236 --> 01:39:20,876
The back
The back entrance! Come

2283
01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:26,630
Softly
OK

2284
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:28,270
Is this OK?
OK

2285
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:30,550
Dude!

2286
01:39:30,575 --> 01:39:31,855
He said left, yes?
Yes

2287
01:39:32,346 --> 01:39:34,506
Why is there a wall?
Let's go right then

2288
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:35,270
OK

2289
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:36,990
This is the entry

2290
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:38,588
Then, this is the shelf

2291
01:39:39,277 --> 01:39:40,357
But there is no Pillayar

2292
01:39:40,543 --> 01:39:41,485
There's a Murugan

2293
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:42,670
Did he say Pillayar or Murugan?

2294
01:39:42,695 --> 01:39:43,415
Pillayar, dude...

2295
01:39:43,470 --> 01:39:44,190
Maybe it's Murugan?

2296
01:39:44,215 --> 01:39:46,175
No He said Pillayar
No it is Murugan

2297
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:47,510
OK Pillayar or Murugan -

2298
01:39:47,550 --> 01:39:48,470
they are brothers

2299
01:39:48,495 --> 01:39:49,695
Let's pray first

2300
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:51,618
What if there is a Pillayar
in the front entrance?

2301
01:39:51,643 --> 01:39:52,763
Let's go front
Wait!

2302
01:39:53,351 --> 01:39:54,751
I'll go check, You wait here

2303
01:39:54,776 --> 01:39:55,976
I'll call you
Be ready

2304
01:39:56,664 --> 01:39:57,774
Dude...Call me soon

2305
01:39:57,799 --> 01:39:58,599
I will try

2306
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:03,469
Dude, I'm inside

2307
01:40:03,494 --> 01:40:04,454
There's a wall on the right

2308
01:40:04,528 --> 01:40:05,968
OK OK Keep going...

2309
01:40:06,536 --> 01:40:07,856
There is an entry in the left

2310
01:40:07,952 --> 01:40:09,192
The Pillayar is here

2311
01:40:09,656 --> 01:40:10,416
OK I'll come there

2312
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:11,990
No, no! Don't!
Why?

2313
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:12,750
No?

2314
01:40:12,790 --> 01:40:14,251
What if they knew our plan and...

2315
01:40:14,276 --> 01:40:16,036
and exchanged the statues?

2316
01:40:16,311 --> 01:40:17,591
There's a door near you

2317
01:40:17,773 --> 01:40:18,384
Go inside

2318
01:40:18,409 --> 01:40:19,009
OK

2319
01:40:20,165 --> 01:40:21,885
Dude, the door opened

2320
01:40:23,270 --> 01:40:24,470
It opened for me too

2321
01:40:24,510 --> 01:40:25,550
There is a door here

2322
01:40:26,064 --> 01:40:27,624
Dude, there's another door here

2323
01:40:28,550 --> 01:40:30,070
You have a door there too?

2324
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:31,550
Why are there two doors?

2325
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:33,790
Dude, just a second I'll pray and come

2326
01:40:34,048 --> 01:40:35,288
Oh God, save us

2327
01:40:35,574 --> 01:40:37,174
Dude I prayed Did you?

2328
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:38,479
Yes I did
Cool

2329
01:40:38,965 --> 01:40:39,790
Dude,

2330
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:41,350
Open that door

2331
01:40:42,910 --> 01:40:43,990
There's a toilet here

2332
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:47,470
There's a toilet here too

2333
01:40:47,678 --> 01:40:48,598
There too?

2334
01:40:48,670 --> 01:40:50,390
Yes!
Why are there two toilets?

2335
01:40:51,093 --> 01:40:52,053
What about the hole?

2336
01:40:52,110 --> 01:40:53,870
Where will it be - the hole?

2337
01:40:59,510 --> 01:41:01,150
I think Kaasi has failed us

2338
01:41:02,910 --> 01:41:04,790
There's no cloth here...

2339
01:41:06,796 --> 01:41:07,556
Dude...

2340
01:41:07,884 --> 01:41:09,517
I found the hole
Where?

2341
01:41:09,542 --> 01:41:11,222
Check the shampoo shelf

2342
01:41:11,310 --> 01:41:12,630
They've closed it with a cloth

2343
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:13,820
Where's the shampoo?

2344
01:41:13,845 --> 01:41:14,885
I found it!

2345
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:15,910
I'll call you back

2346
01:41:29,619 --> 01:41:30,647
Hey, wait!

2347
01:41:31,878 --> 01:41:33,110
I told you to wai...!

2348
01:41:38,436 --> 01:41:40,116
Please step aside

2349
01:41:40,790 --> 01:41:42,550
Please step aside

2350
01:41:44,437 --> 01:41:45,917
Thanks

2351
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:01,868
Do you know why I
asked you to step aside?

2352
01:42:01,893 --> 01:42:02,613
Why...?

2353
01:42:02,798 --> 01:42:03,969
It might spray

2354
01:42:03,994 --> 01:42:04,994
That's why

2355
01:42:05,188 --> 01:42:05,828
Go on

2356
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:08,550
Open and go

2357
01:42:08,870 --> 01:42:09,618
Bye

2358
01:42:12,925 --> 01:42:13,645
Dude!

2359
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:15,592
He got scared and ran away
Behind you...

2360
01:42:15,655 --> 01:42:17,095
...find him then...
Behind you!

2361
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:18,390
Behind you!

2362
01:42:20,110 --> 01:42:22,070
I'll fall at your feet and ask forgiveness

2363
01:42:24,049 --> 01:42:25,369
This is next, right?

2364
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:30,630
A gun...!

2365
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:34,070
Yep

2366
01:42:35,557 --> 01:42:36,282
The camera?

2367
01:42:36,307 --> 01:42:38,805
He threw the camera into the river
Shut it!

2368
01:42:38,830 --> 01:42:40,430
That's the cause of all problems
Please!

2369
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:41,830
Eff off
Forget that

2370
01:42:42,270 --> 01:42:43,350
Call your girl

2371
01:42:43,604 --> 01:42:44,670
What?

2372
01:42:44,695 --> 01:42:46,070
You kidnapped her

2373
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:46,992
What did you do to my girl?
Hey!

2374
01:42:47,017 --> 01:42:48,961
I said, call your girl

2375
01:42:48,986 --> 01:42:49,506
Hey!

2376
01:42:49,591 --> 01:42:51,471
When an elder tells you to call, you call

2377
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:54,350
Hey! Wait!

2378
01:42:58,270 --> 01:43:00,470
You are I are over

2379
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:01,310
Hang up!

2380
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:03,099
Hello darling!

2381
01:43:03,357 --> 01:43:05,150
Darling!
I will slipper you

2382
01:43:05,190 --> 01:43:06,870
Darling, this is Godfather speaking

2383
01:43:06,943 --> 01:43:07,983
Godfather?

2384
01:43:08,112 --> 01:43:09,870
How are you calling from his number?

2385
01:43:09,910 --> 01:43:11,390
You thought you could escape

2386
01:43:11,790 --> 01:43:13,470
Your guys were caught here

2387
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:14,860
Now, you come here

2388
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:16,710
What is it?

2389
01:43:16,807 --> 01:43:19,510
Who asked these guys to be heroic?

2390
01:43:20,652 --> 01:43:21,492
Arrgh!!

2391
01:43:25,070 --> 01:43:27,183
Do you have brains?
How will I know that you'll escape?

2392
01:43:27,208 --> 01:43:28,808
Can you do one thing right?

2393
01:43:31,230 --> 01:43:32,371
For you,...

2394
01:43:32,396 --> 01:43:34,836
I should present a huge punishment

2395
01:43:35,653 --> 01:43:37,893
What shall I do?

2396
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:40,310
I'll wear my coat and think

2397
01:43:46,352 --> 01:43:47,469
Hey! What are you doing?

2398
01:43:47,494 --> 01:43:48,344
Trying to escape

2399
01:43:48,398 --> 01:43:49,918
Please save me too
OK

2400
01:43:50,401 --> 01:43:51,481
Shut up

2401
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:57,747
Come on, come on!
Keep quiet

2402
01:43:57,772 --> 01:43:58,904
I'm trying
He's going to find out

2403
01:43:58,929 --> 01:44:00,369
Quickly
The, the first hit is you

2404
01:44:00,568 --> 01:44:01,968
Don't listen to her
Hey!

2405
01:44:06,647 --> 01:44:07,927
Please tell him...

2406
01:44:09,670 --> 01:44:10,990
What are you searching for?

2407
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:13,110
Car keys are missing

2408
01:44:13,712 --> 01:44:15,072
Then, let's go in my car

2409
01:44:16,055 --> 01:44:17,615
Sure
Sir, my car is punctured

2410
01:44:17,726 --> 01:44:18,447
Let's go

2411
01:44:18,472 --> 01:44:19,952
But it's a punctured car!
We'll fix it

2412
01:44:20,023 --> 01:44:21,183
Godfather! Hey!

2413
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:22,390
Father...

2414
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:24,070
S**t
Father!

2415
01:44:24,764 --> 01:44:26,350
Hey! There's no space
Ow!

2416
01:44:26,375 --> 01:44:28,015
Move
Can I sit in the front?

2417
01:44:28,072 --> 01:44:28,873
Godfather! Let us go

2418
01:44:28,898 --> 01:44:30,458
Hey Godfather!
Please...

2419
01:44:30,614 --> 01:44:32,054
Where are you taking...?

2420
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:34,169
Godfather!

2421
01:44:34,194 --> 01:44:35,434
Please let us go

2422
01:44:35,782 --> 01:44:36,822
Please!

2423
01:44:37,894 --> 01:44:39,614
What are you searching for?

2424
01:44:40,273 --> 01:44:42,193
These keys are

2425
01:44:44,006 --> 01:44:45,109
How did you get this?

2426
01:44:45,134 --> 01:44:46,334
What is that?
What is that?

2427
01:44:47,008 --> 01:44:47,470
Bomb

2428
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:48,670
What!
Bomb!

2429
01:44:48,695 --> 01:44:49,415
You!

2430
01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:52,656
You kept saying that
it was engine problem...

2431
01:44:52,681 --> 01:44:53,562
It's a bomb!

2432
01:44:53,587 --> 01:44:54,787
Sorry dude! Technical fault

2433
01:44:55,150 --> 01:44:56,590
Sorry sir
You all should...

2434
01:45:23,569 --> 01:45:26,489
Is this apocalypto - taking us with a rope

2435
01:45:30,951 --> 01:45:32,951
Hey! Hey! Somebody come here!

2436
01:45:32,975 --> 01:45:33,935
Where did you all go?

2437
01:45:34,015 --> 01:45:35,295
Hey Godfather!

2438
01:45:36,039 --> 01:45:37,159
You old fag!

2439
01:45:44,030 --> 01:45:45,510
Hello, Amanda

2440
01:45:46,390 --> 01:45:48,070
You don't know me, but

2441
01:45:48,350 --> 01:45:49,510
I know you

2442
01:45:49,990 --> 01:45:51,590
I want to play a game

2443
01:45:52,830 --> 01:45:53,990
Hey! What?

2444
01:45:54,030 --> 01:45:55,110
I'm looking for a wire

2445
01:45:55,776 --> 01:45:56,496
You...

2446
01:45:57,270 --> 01:45:58,630
Scram
Thanks

2447
01:45:59,148 --> 01:45:59,988
Sorry

2448
01:46:00,013 --> 01:46:02,133
So, how you are going to die is,

2449
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:04,550
after the countdown,...
the machine in front of you

2450
01:46:04,575 --> 01:46:07,095
will punch and try to kill you

2451
01:46:07,386 --> 01:46:08,746
If you don't die,

2452
01:46:08,771 --> 01:46:09,891
the saw above you,...

2453
01:46:10,134 --> 01:46:12,354
will inch down and slice your head

2454
01:46:12,379 --> 01:46:14,180
If you still don't die,

2455
01:46:14,205 --> 01:46:16,140
the saw below you, will slice your butt

2456
01:46:16,165 --> 01:46:16,925
No!

2457
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:18,913
I don't want this machine
Give me another!

2458
01:46:18,938 --> 01:46:20,938
Why do you want another?
You are going to die

2459
01:46:20,963 --> 01:46:22,363
Die!
Go away!

2460
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:23,710
Before dawn,...

2461
01:46:24,633 --> 01:46:26,553
Make your choice

2462
01:46:42,061 --> 01:46:42,941
Dude!

2463
01:46:42,990 --> 01:46:44,030
We're done!

2464
01:47:00,863 --> 01:47:02,823
It's punching me!

2465
01:47:04,110 --> 01:47:06,790
It's spinning above and below!

2466
01:47:07,552 --> 01:47:08,592
Bruce Lee!

2467
01:47:13,870 --> 01:47:15,630
Oh Nooooooo!

2468
01:47:17,134 --> 01:47:18,140
Oh yay!

2469
01:47:18,165 --> 01:47:19,325
It is malfunctioning

2470
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:20,870
Super!

2471
01:47:21,071 --> 01:47:22,471
It'll be repaired in 5

2472
01:47:23,034 --> 01:47:23,860
How?

2473
01:47:23,885 --> 01:47:25,485
It's Sunday
The technicians won't come

2474
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:26,590
I will do it

2475
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:27,670
Sir,...

2476
01:47:27,743 --> 01:47:29,503
Where are you going?

2477
01:47:29,765 --> 01:47:30,394
Spanner

2478
01:47:30,419 --> 01:47:32,139
OK Return quickly I'm scared

2479
01:47:34,036 --> 01:47:35,996
Dude! How do we escape?

2480
01:47:39,051 --> 01:47:39,811
I knew it

2481
01:47:39,836 --> 01:47:41,950
Your faces told me you'll mess it up

2482
01:47:41,990 --> 01:47:42,830
So, I followed

2483
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:45,070
Brother!
Stop talking and help! Yea yea

2484
01:47:45,110 --> 01:47:47,060
How will I know one room
has two toilets?

2485
01:47:47,085 --> 01:47:49,645
Godfather has knee pain
He can't sit on his hunches

2486
01:47:50,044 --> 01:47:50,910
So he uses western toilet

2487
01:47:50,935 --> 01:47:52,255
But he prefers the Indian one

2488
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:54,480
Come here! Come here!
I am...I am

2489
01:47:54,969 --> 01:47:56,289
Dude, quickly!

2490
01:48:08,350 --> 01:48:09,790
Throw the gun away

2491
01:48:17,169 --> 01:48:17,889
Hey!

2492
01:48:18,722 --> 01:48:20,350
Now, you throw the gun away

2493
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:21,990
Son, not just your gun...

2494
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:24,200
all guns on this set,

2495
01:48:24,804 --> 01:48:25,804
don't have bullets

2496
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:28,040
S**t

2497
01:48:28,065 --> 01:48:29,245
Forget the gun

2498
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:31,470
We are six
You are alone

2499
01:48:31,590 --> 01:48:33,190
You'll die if we all hit you

2500
01:48:33,215 --> 01:48:35,935
But all villains get a chance to repent

2501
01:48:36,174 --> 01:48:37,654
I'll give you that

2502
01:48:37,790 --> 01:48:39,630
Scram!
One more thing,

2503
01:48:40,982 --> 01:48:43,859
The men who went for the wedding
missed Pandyan Express...

2504
01:48:43,918 --> 01:48:46,878
and without using the
next Pallavan express,...

2505
01:48:47,318 --> 01:48:48,918
have returned

2506
01:48:51,190 --> 01:48:52,270
Oh no!

2507
01:48:53,870 --> 01:48:54,670
Come on!

2508
01:48:54,950 --> 01:48:56,950
Hey!
Catch them! Hey!

2509
01:48:57,007 --> 01:48:59,127
Yea! Run into me just like that

2510
01:48:59,919 --> 01:49:01,199
Catch him!
Abbas !

2511
01:49:01,224 --> 01:49:02,264
Abbas, come quickly!

2512
01:49:05,056 --> 01:49:08,136
Why do they all look like
the thugs from old Ramki movies?

2513
01:49:17,613 --> 01:49:19,093
Why are you getting beaten up?

2514
01:49:34,423 --> 01:49:35,183
Dude!

2515
01:49:35,279 --> 01:49:36,328
Come cut this!

2516
01:49:36,353 --> 01:49:38,237
He's coming to hit me!
Come on! Cut it!

2517
01:49:38,262 --> 01:49:40,342
He's coming! Come on!
Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!

2518
01:49:41,367 --> 01:49:42,527
Cut!

2519
01:49:45,734 --> 01:49:47,174
What's with these guys?

2520
01:49:52,045 --> 01:49:52,645
Action!

2521
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:54,310
Hey! Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!

2522
01:49:55,670 --> 01:49:56,310
Son,

2523
01:49:56,335 --> 01:49:57,655
I'm the true don

2524
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:59,033
They came to act in movies

2525
01:49:59,058 --> 01:50:00,298
They'll stop if you yell cut

2526
01:50:00,878 --> 01:50:01,678
Damn

2527
01:50:01,703 --> 01:50:02,623
Then let's pack up!

2528
01:50:02,648 --> 01:50:03,528
Hey!

2529
01:50:04,489 --> 01:50:06,489
Don't stop till I tell you to

2530
01:50:07,528 --> 01:50:08,408
Action!

2531
01:50:24,230 --> 01:50:25,150
Shhh!

2532
01:50:25,541 --> 01:50:26,981
Your shot is over
Lie down

2533
01:50:27,550 --> 01:50:28,550
Lie down

2534
01:50:31,190 --> 01:50:32,310
Hey! Go!

2535
01:50:40,441 --> 01:50:42,001
Hey! Get 'em!

2536
01:50:44,824 --> 01:50:45,664
Manickkam!

2537
01:50:45,689 --> 01:50:47,329
I want Abbas alive

2538
01:50:47,423 --> 01:50:49,343
Tell them, I am back

2539
01:50:49,368 --> 01:50:52,288
I am back
This is Kabali

2540
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:56,230
Push me!

2541
01:51:23,281 --> 01:51:23,961
Dude,

2542
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,560
Uncle is back!
Oh shut up

2543
01:51:28,196 --> 01:51:30,436
What is he doing?
A scene from Ghilli

2544
01:51:36,904 --> 01:51:38,824
(Song from movie 'Varlaru')

2545
01:51:42,713 --> 01:51:44,873
Did he lose his mind after the beating?

2546
01:51:54,550 --> 01:51:55,870
He is dead meat

2547
01:51:57,070 --> 01:51:58,070
Let's go

2548
01:52:03,470 --> 01:52:05,630
Sir, sir... Don't shoot!

2549
01:52:06,310 --> 01:52:07,910
Here, eat this banana

2550
01:52:09,710 --> 01:52:12,310
He is peeling the banana
like loading bullets into the gun

2551
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:14,980
Sir, please no

2552
01:52:18,063 --> 01:52:19,023
Thanks, son

2553
01:52:19,230 --> 01:52:21,841
To take a dip
in the Thamirabharani river

2554
01:52:21,866 --> 01:52:22,586
Sorry sir!

2555
01:52:22,704 --> 01:52:24,184
Sorry sir!
Why did you push that away?

2556
01:52:24,286 --> 01:52:25,566
You stupid mongrel!

2557
01:52:25,870 --> 01:52:27,485
I brought only one fruit

2558
01:52:27,510 --> 01:52:28,040
Shall I run and...

2559
01:52:28,065 --> 01:52:29,945
get it from the nearest store?
Will you?

2560
01:52:30,026 --> 01:52:31,226
Go quickly, idiot!

2561
01:52:35,790 --> 01:52:37,150
Dude! Why?

2562
01:52:37,590 --> 01:52:38,750
Dude! Just a minute...

2563
01:52:38,790 --> 01:52:39,853
Dude, what are you doing?

2564
01:52:39,878 --> 01:52:40,692
Punch him!

2565
01:52:40,717 --> 01:52:41,689
No way

2566
01:52:41,764 --> 01:52:43,044
Dude, don't embarrass me

2567
01:52:43,132 --> 01:52:45,292
You have to punch
because your name is Bruce Lee

2568
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:46,808
You say so?
Yea!

2569
01:52:46,833 --> 01:52:48,633
OK Hold him tight
Yea! Come on!

2570
01:52:49,071 --> 01:52:49,791
Super!

2571
01:52:49,855 --> 01:52:51,535
Just like that, yea!
Hold him tight, man

2572
01:52:51,683 --> 01:52:52,509
Yea!

2573
01:52:53,776 --> 01:52:54,736
Oh no!

2574
01:52:54,817 --> 01:52:56,377
Run!
You dodo!

2575
01:52:57,891 --> 01:52:58,811
It's a good thing,

2576
01:52:58,836 --> 01:53:00,276
the fruit police is missing

2577
01:53:00,301 --> 01:53:01,021
Gotcha!

2578
01:53:01,089 --> 01:53:02,649
Running away are you!
Sir, sir!

2579
01:53:03,150 --> 01:53:04,030
I bought it, sir

2580
01:53:04,383 --> 01:53:05,503
Store is nearby
Fantastic!

2581
01:53:05,832 --> 01:53:07,672
For one fruit, he's bought a dozen

2582
01:53:07,759 --> 01:53:08,485
Leave it there!

2583
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:09,452
Fruits?

2584
01:53:09,477 --> 01:53:11,516
I searched the length of this
movie for you and the fruit

2585
01:53:11,541 --> 01:53:12,501
You should be...

2586
01:53:13,671 --> 01:53:14,551
Hey Kabali!

2587
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:15,550
Here's a fruit

2588
01:53:15,621 --> 01:53:16,461
Please sir

2589
01:53:17,019 --> 01:53:18,090
Pass the fruit

2590
01:53:18,115 --> 01:53:19,115
Is there another?

2591
01:53:20,070 --> 01:53:20,910
Hey!

2592
01:53:21,110 --> 01:53:22,350
What are you doing?

2593
01:53:23,310 --> 01:53:24,371
No more fruit for you

2594
01:53:24,396 --> 01:53:25,676
I'm changing to bomb!

2595
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:28,150
Move it!

2596
01:53:28,570 --> 01:53:29,810
Didn't you say Cut?

2597
01:53:30,350 --> 01:53:32,110
Do anything! But they,

2598
01:53:37,845 --> 01:53:39,085
Hey! Watch this!

2599
01:53:39,150 --> 01:53:40,230
Look dude!

2600
01:53:40,256 --> 01:53:42,056
Why is he break-dancing?

2601
01:53:42,127 --> 01:53:43,365
Hey! Wait!

2602
01:53:43,390 --> 01:53:44,550
Godfather is calling you

2603
01:53:45,992 --> 01:53:46,912
Yes, Godfather!

2604
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:49,110
Yes, Godfather?

2605
01:53:50,121 --> 01:53:51,841
You act well, Godfather!

2606
01:53:51,984 --> 01:53:53,431
Do you want a hug?

2607
01:53:53,456 --> 01:53:54,096
Here!

2608
01:53:56,910 --> 01:53:58,110
Yuck!

2609
01:54:00,270 --> 01:54:01,390
What are they doing?

2610
01:54:03,617 --> 01:54:05,057
Godfather!

2611
01:54:05,097 --> 01:54:08,217
No!

2612
01:54:08,398 --> 01:54:09,438
Hey!
What the!!!

2613
01:54:10,350 --> 01:54:11,030
Yuck!

2614
01:54:11,159 --> 01:54:12,959
What are they?
Ack!

2615
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:21,950
Die!

2616
01:54:33,183 --> 01:54:34,263
Oh No! Brother Kaasi!

2617
01:54:34,510 --> 01:54:35,590
Brother Kaasi?

2618
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:38,145
Brother Kaasi, have you left
to be with Maasi?

2619
01:54:38,230 --> 01:54:39,550
Oh no! Brother! How can I...

2620
01:54:40,030 --> 01:54:41,110
Brother...

2621
01:54:41,135 --> 01:54:42,175
Hey! Get up

2622
01:54:43,270 --> 01:54:44,390
What did you say on the phone?

2623
01:54:44,430 --> 01:54:45,670
You don't want me, eh?

2624
01:54:45,806 --> 01:54:47,806
They held me for two days

2625
01:54:47,831 --> 01:54:50,871
Instead of running towards me,
you are crying for him

2626
01:54:50,950 --> 01:54:52,430
What do you think of yourself?

2627
01:54:52,710 --> 01:54:54,110
One minute
Just one

2628
01:54:54,750 --> 01:54:55,390
Sir,

2629
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:58,270
Why is that in all movies
the cops arrive in the climax?

2630
01:54:58,295 --> 01:54:59,455
How did you get here?

2631
01:54:59,799 --> 01:55:01,599
You have understood wrong

2632
01:55:01,710 --> 01:55:03,230
The police have always been here

2633
01:55:03,464 --> 01:55:06,264
Because I questioned them,
they stuffed a fruit in my mouth

2634
01:55:06,470 --> 01:55:09,510
I chased them to get
my revenge with a fruit

2635
01:55:10,830 --> 01:55:12,150
Maasi!

2636
01:55:13,190 --> 01:55:14,630
and Maasi was killed by someone

2637
01:55:15,256 --> 01:55:17,510
So I tried to kill Kaasi with a gun,...

2638
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:19,607
But he bent down to pick his keys...
Brother!

2639
01:55:19,688 --> 01:55:21,208
...that bullet killed the judge

2640
01:55:25,805 --> 01:55:28,664
So I decided to finish
Kaasi and Godfather,

2641
01:55:28,689 --> 01:55:29,929
with a gun and fruit...

2642
01:55:30,110 --> 01:55:31,790
But you ask me why we arrive last

2643
01:55:31,975 --> 01:55:33,535
Oh! That's how you end up here

2644
01:55:33,984 --> 01:55:35,464
Why didn't you say something?

2645
01:55:35,646 --> 01:55:36,966
The audience are scolding you

2646
01:55:37,139 --> 01:55:37,788
Forget that

2647
01:55:37,813 --> 01:55:38,693
Back to our issue
Hello,

2648
01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:39,470
Excuse me

2649
01:55:39,619 --> 01:55:41,339
Please wait! We are talking
Go away!

2650
01:55:42,132 --> 01:55:43,332
Impatient lil

2651
01:55:43,418 --> 01:55:45,138
Why are you starting?

2652
01:55:45,247 --> 01:55:46,567
Right after you leave

2653
01:55:46,732 --> 01:55:48,892
Thank you sir
They'll ask for police protection too

2654
01:55:50,832 --> 01:55:52,472
You destroyed my whole gang!

2655
01:55:52,768 --> 01:55:54,128
See what I'll do!

2656
01:55:54,774 --> 01:55:57,734
What's that tick tick sound?

2657
01:55:58,079 --> 01:55:59,839
Here, from here

2658
01:56:02,405 --> 01:56:03,725
This bomb?

2659
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:04,870
It will blow up!

2660
01:56:05,647 --> 01:56:06,967
It bombed out alright
