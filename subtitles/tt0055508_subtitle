1
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,398
I don't seem to recognize you.

2
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,339
Have you just come?

3
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,741
That's right.

4
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,014
My name is Sri Gobindolal Chakraborty.

5
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,015
I teach in this village.

6
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,251
I am here for twenty years.

7
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,151
Namaste.

8
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,431
Sitting here... in the evening...

9
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,264
on the Saha's ghat...

10
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,234
No... no... don't misunderstand me

11
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,336
but... those who believe in...

12
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,430
ghosts and spirits...

13
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,209
...they prefer the evenings...

14
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,699
What about you?

15
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,074
I am carefree.

16
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,451
I also have a special interest

17
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,443
in ghosts and spirits

18
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,991
but I haven't been fortunate

19
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,983
enough to spot one myself.

20
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,329
You see this book?

21
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,093
In this house of the Sahas

22
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,138
an absolutely astonishing

23
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,730
event happened.

24
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,164
It's all recorded here.

25
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,411
You got an interview with one, I bet.

26
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,149
That's right but...

27
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,140
how many appreciate my powers?

28
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,384
They think I am high on hash

29
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,047
but who can make them understand?

30
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,859
Even Ayurveda says that smoking

31
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,054
hash stokes the imagination.

32
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,162
Your story...

33
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,329
Want to hear it?

34
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,195
You can call it a story...

35
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,529
...or history...

36
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,877
please listen carefully,

37
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,111
listen:

38
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,022
about thirty years ago,

39
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,358
in the beginning of the month of January,

40
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,327
one morning, a carriage stopped

41
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:25,093
at the Saha residence at Manikpur.

42
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,325
From the carriage alighted

43
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,569
a young Bengali man

44
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,096
Saha and his wife Monimalika.

45
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,674
The old manager of the estate,

46
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,809
Teenkori, escorted the couple

47
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,902
to the upstairs room.

48
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,675
Upon the death of the father,

49
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,347
the son had inherited the estate.

50
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,253
Phanibhusan relocated himself

51
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,255
and his wife from Calcutta to

52
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,246
Manikpur to claim his inheritance.

53
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,327
It is a matter of pride that

54
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,318
you have come to stay here.

55
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,466
I'll finish all the work and then

56
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,162
quietly bide my time.

57
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,606
Well, now you take

58
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:10,736
charge of everything.

59
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:15,248
Everything is yours but I am

60
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:20,242
concerned about your wife.

61
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,822
There is no need to worry. She will

62
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,052
get used to living here after awhile.

63
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,293
Anyway I am here for

64
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,285
anything you may need.

65
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,066
Don't worry. There won't be

66
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,055
any problems.

67
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,301
Okay. Then I will carry on.

68
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,364
Okay.

69
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,134
Take your leave.

70
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,808
Moni,

71
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,886
how do you like it?

72
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,093
See that?

73
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,064
Boats with our jute,

74
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,462
our boats.

75
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,967
What bird is that singing?

76
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,636
Ask Bhagirath.

77
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,042
Bhagirath?

78
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,043
My servant.

79
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:39,955
So tell me. How do you like it Moni?

80
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:46,289
How calm. How peaceful.

81
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,027
Moni,

82
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,071
I brought you here because

83
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,868
you wanted to come.

84
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,140
If you don t like it then...

85
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,116
I like it very much.

86
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,420
My aunty. She was

87
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,978
known for her beauty.

88
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,191
If I wore as much jewellery

89
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,283
I would be too.

90
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,229
Even without it, you are.

91
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,397
Oh! So you don't want to

92
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:03,101
give me jewellery, I suppose.

93
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,771
Haven't I given it to you before?

94
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,348
So you won't give me anymore?

95
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,248
I will,

96
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,948
now I will.

97
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,720
What do you say?

98
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,553
Oh! There is a condition, I suppose?

99
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,333
What?

100
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,300
What condition?

101
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,245
You have to love me.

102
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,444
"You have to love me."

103
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,091
By uttering these magic words he

104
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,082
thought he could gain her love.

105
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,318
He was under that impression.

106
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,432
He failed to realize that crudeness

107
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,434
would have more impact

108
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,698
than gentlemanly behaviour.

109
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,139
Women like to have sour mango

110
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,767
and hot pepper.

111
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,245
A deer seeks a hard tree trunk

112
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,043
to sharpen its antlers.

113
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,851
It is not satisfied with

114
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,353
the soft banana tree.

115
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,151
Phanibhusan was like the banana tree.

116
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,092
Anyway, one afternoon

117
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,083
after this incident:

118
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,206
Mistress,

119
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,545
someone is here to see you.

120
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,319
Why is he here? The master

121
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,411
is in the office.

122
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,354
He has come to see you.

123
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,655
To see me?

124
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,788
That's right. He claims to be your brother.

125
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,456
My...

126
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,661
Do you recognize me?

127
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,201
Bhagirath, you may go now.

128
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,416
I think you don't recognize me.

129
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,051
My name is...

130
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,109
I know.

131
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,188
Oh, you remember me?

132
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,712
How fortunate I am.

133
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,624
What do you want?

134
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,927
I live in the next village.

135
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,829
I heard you had come.

136
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,990
What do you want from me?

137
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,934
Don't worry Moni, I haven't come

138
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,425
to talk about the past.

139
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,939
What past? And what is there

140
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,531
to talk about?

141
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,409
Even if there was, I did not

142
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,240
come to speak about that.

143
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,303
You are getting me wrong.

144
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,983
I don't have time. Tell me

145
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,644
what you want.

146
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,182
I need some work.

147
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:06,787
What work?

148
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,322
Alms.

149
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:10,921
What?

150
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,264
I will die of starvation.

151
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,960
Monimalika, I have come to you...

152
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:18,735
What can I do?

153
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,575
If you talk to your husband

154
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,279
for your distant cousin,

155
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,247
a job in his office...

156
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,384
I will speak to him if you promise

157
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,251
never to return to this house.

158
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,124
Sure, unless the office falls under

159
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,058
the domain of this house.

160
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,390
I don't want to listen to you anymore.

161
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,122
Okay then I won't disturb you anymore.

162
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,731
Don't. Or else it won't be good.

163
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:53,064
If ever you need me for anything...

164
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,001
No. I don't see that happening.

165
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,542
Okay. I am leaving.

166
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,276
Moni

167
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,247
Moni

168
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,364
Bhagirath

169
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,965
What's this? Oh you.

170
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,399
I was getting worried.

171
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,364
How do I look?

172
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,235
What's the reason?

173
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,002
Just like that.

174
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,585
Didn't you say you don't

175
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,052
have any jewellery?

176
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,723
Have you seen how I have

177
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,156
decorated the bed?

178
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,296
If I don't do all this

179
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,331
how do I bide my time?

180
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,822
Is this anything to say?

181
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,436
If you are finding it difficult to

182
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,301
pass your time here then don't stay.

183
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,828
Go back to Calcutta.

184
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,073
No, not to Calcutta.

185
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,379
Not anymore.

186
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:21,353
They don't like me.

187
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,150
You think I don't know?

188
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,391
What are you saying, Moni?

189
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,120
Who doesn't like you?

190
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,854
Who doesn't like you?

191
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:37,333
All the relatives

192
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,297
because I couldn't have a child.

193
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,647
Moni... Moni... now, now.

194
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,377
You are behaving like a child.

195
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,215
No I am not behaving like a child.

196
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:03,417
We are married for ten years.

197
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,102
You are laughing?

198
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,093
Don't you feel anything?

199
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,430
You actually don't feel anything?

200
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,007
Tell me,

201
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,842
honestly tell me,

202
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,347
don't you think I am unlucky?

203
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,349
That I am a bad omen?

204
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,985
Moni... Moni. How can you

205
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,977
think such thoughts? How?

206
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:30,784
How can you say this?

207
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,979
You don't think so?

208
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,319
Listen to me... Moni... look at me.

209
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,290
We both want a child. Just because...

210
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,401
can't you understand

211
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,392
how much I love you eh?

212
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,026
Moni... Moni?

213
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,876
Then how did I get this feeling?

214
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,949
You won't any more,

215
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,788
don't let it.

216
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,592
Throw all your fears and

217
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,026
worries into the river.

218
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:13,987
What do you say?

219
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,367
Oh, what did he say his name was?

220
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:31,339
Er... er... Madhu...

221
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,249
Madhusudhan.

222
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,446
That's right.

223
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,189
He's my...

224
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,986
your distant cousin, isn't he?

225
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:39,921
That's right.

226
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,684
Do you think you can...

227
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,996
Yes. I have already made arrangements.

228
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,259
Are you happy?

229
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,936
Yes.

230
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:08,382
The tune plays softly

231
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:18,092
the tune plays softly

232
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,316
Oh, you have come?

233
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,448
What's that?

234
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,271
But that's not the reward

235
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,262
for your song

236
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,839
for that I'll owe you one.

237
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:27,374
What happened? Moni... Monimalika...

238
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,188
You know...

239
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,247
Yes, tell me.

240
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,326
How long has Bhagirath been employed here?

241
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,525
Why do you ask?

242
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,432
You tell me.

243
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,068
Before my birth.

244
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,099
Why?

245
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:53,706
Moni?

246
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,548
Today as I was looking

247
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,539
through my jewellery box...

248
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,512
...he entered my room...

249
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,983
and... was looking longingly.

250
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:10,891
Don't laugh.

251
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,288
Look here Moni.

252
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,362
You can doubt me if you want

253
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,230
but not Bhagirath.

254
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,700
What if he does something?

255
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,273
Then I shall punish him

256
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,881
and why do you keep playing

257
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,473
with your jewellery all the time?

258
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,007
People will think you are mad.

259
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,552
What else is there to do?

260
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,154
You tell me.

261
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,334
Fine. Play with your jewellery

262
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,323
as much as you please.

263
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,429
It's your right to do so,

264
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,128
you are a queen.

265
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,839
Of cards?

266
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,477
Do you know what queen?

267
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,079
What queen?

268
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,211
Jute queen

269
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,455
Alas, Phanibhusan, did your

270
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:11,990
simple mind ever imagine

271
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,360
that all your fancy dreams

272
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,352
would come to nought?

273
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,134
The crux of your wealth

274
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:26,127
your peace, your happiness... jute.

275
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,940
That same jute one day would

276
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,135
light up to darken your future.

277
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,210
The losses are immense, aren't they?

278
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:16,883
Yes.

279
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,912
I have to do something,

280
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,723
There's no other way.

281
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,829
What will happen?

282
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,368
Don't worry,

283
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,899
I'll make some arrangements.

284
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,068
How?

285
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,144
Don't worry... don't worry...

286
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,781
Then why are you worrying?

287
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,220
What arrangements? Tell me.

288
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,431
This is all business talk.

289
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,422
You won't understand

290
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,759
Tell me, I'll try.

291
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,297
I have to make good the losses.

292
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:12,239
How much?

293
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:18,742
Do you have the money?

294
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,413
That's what i am thinking about.

295
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,298
Can't my jewellery

296
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,287
make up for the losses?

297
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:40,968
What?

298
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,038
My jewellery?

299
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:10,530
Moni,

300
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,162
will you give me your jewellery?

301
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:22,975
What happened?

302
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,148
What happened?

303
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,368
I did not ask for

304
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,995
your jewellery, Moni?

305
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,233
You would have.

306
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,368
What?

307
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,108
How can you...

308
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,175
You would have

309
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,014
I know, you would have.

310
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,683
That's what you were thinking.

311
00:26:58,683 --> 00:26:59,479
No.

312
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:00,813
No, Moni.

313
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,310
I never even considered such a thing.

314
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,217
Then what were you thinking?

315
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,060
... I was thinking...

316
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,059
I was thinking...

317
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:23,441
...of going to Calcutta

318
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:24,533
to arrange for some money,

319
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,011
but how can I leave

320
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,774
you alone here and go?

321
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:31,909
And you won't go to Calcutta.

322
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,853
I have no other option but this Moni.

323
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,551
Oh, you can go.

324
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,158
I'll be all right.

325
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:45,653
I won't have any problems.

326
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,006
You will be all alone?

327
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:56,574
So what?

328
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,638
I'll be all right.

329
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,245
Moreover, Bhagirath is also here.

330
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,244
I won't have any problems. You go.

331
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,412
I have to go, Moni.

332
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,281
I have no other option,

333
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,524
almost thirty thousand rupees.

334
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:22,199
What if you don't get the money?

335
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:32,371
I will get it.

336
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:39,216
Once I get the money, I'll get you a...

337
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,145
Careful, Phanibhusan,

338
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,013
the future seems unfavourable.

339
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,282
You went to Calcutta because

340
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,451
you had no other option,

341
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,497
but then why didn't you compel

342
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,192
your wife to go with you?

343
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,128
What is wrong with your manhood?

344
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,369
Don't you know that your wife is sick?

345
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,360
and incapable of making decisions?

346
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,107
Is this obsessive greed of

347
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,598
Monimalika normal?

348
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:32,294
Who's that?

349
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,095
It's me, Madhusudhan.

350
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,538
Oh, come in.

351
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,106
Where are you?

352
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:51,780
What happened?

353
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,351
Have you dyed your hair?

354
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:55,882
I can't believe it.

355
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,198
I have to go to my father's house.

356
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,187
You have to take me,

357
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,025
you have to take me. It's very important.

358
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,061
Can't you go after a couple of days?

359
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,402
In just a couple of days, your husb...

360
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,270
I know.

361
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,213
I can't tell you anything. Don't ask me.

362
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:18,148
Tell me. Will you take me?

363
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,421
You want to go to your father's house?

364
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,982
And I have to take you there?

365
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:29,923
Your husband?

366
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,625
Will you take me or not?

367
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,526
Tell me, will you take me or not?

368
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,472
Will you go or not? Tell me.

369
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:43,030
Wait, wait Monimalika,

370
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:48,973
Wait. Let me sit down. Let me think.

371
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,152
Will you go or not, tell me.

372
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:01,855
I will go, but then what?

373
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,027
Do you know why

374
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,388
my husband has gone to Calcutta?

375
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,428
I can well guess.

376
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:24,977
She wants to go to her father's house

377
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,218
and I...

378
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,478
See? Can you see?

379
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:35,289
If he can't arrange the money

380
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:36,791
none of this will be left.

381
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,121
Then nothing will be left,

382
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,095
everything will be over.

383
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,230
I will not let that happen.

384
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,162
Are you planning to take it with you?

385
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:50,808
If I don't take it, how will I survive?

386
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:52,704
I will die.

387
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,373
When do you plan to come back?

388
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:58,980
Will you go?

389
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,413
Will you go?

390
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,854
Tell me, will you go?

391
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,567
Tell me, will you go or not?

392
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:21,028
Today, there is a drama.

393
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,602
Today?

394
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:30,347
Send Bhagirath to watch it.

395
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,082
This very day?

396
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,089
This very day?

397
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,963
Come in.

398
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,038
Are you ready?

399
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,175
Just a minute.

400
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,948
Let me sit down for a while.

401
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:03,806
A question has come to my mind.

402
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,870
I thought I would ask you.

403
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,376
Tell me.

404
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:24,328
You are deserting

405
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:29,322
a person so dear to you...

406
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:37,371
don't you have any regrets?

407
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:42,707
I have one regret.

408
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,118
He had promised to bring me

409
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,109
some jewellery.

410
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,222
I won't get that.

411
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,575
Let's go.

412
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:21,507
Come.

413
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:22,649
What about...

414
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:24,783
What?

415
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,015
Your box?

416
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:28,017
What box?

417
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,558
Your jewellery box?

418
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,139
I have worn them all.

419
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,774
I won't part with them as long as I live.

420
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:08,289
What... come on.

421
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,121
Moni?

422
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,564
Moni?

423
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,300
Moni!

424
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,605
What happened?

425
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,415
Yesterday there was a drama...

426
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,982
she told me...

427
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,988
Tell me, where has she gone?

428
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:12,390
Don't blame me... I don't know...

429
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,381
anything... I don't know anything...

430
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:19,329
There was no news of her.

431
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:23,034
You have to pay for your sins.

432
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:27,027
There's no forgiveness, no escape.

433
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,329
Did you call, master?

434
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:44,406
Turn off the lamp.

435
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,461
Moni

436
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,401
Moni

437
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:07,409
Moni

438
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:11,177
Moni

439
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:41,008
Did you want something?

440
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,985
No.

441
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,001
Are you listening?

442
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,775
I thought you had fallen asleep.

443
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:11,940
Okay, listen.

444
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:18,781
The next day was the full moon.

445
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:10,920
Moni

446
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:16,051
you have come back?

447
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,130
So? You heard the story?

448
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,265
How did you like it?

449
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:05,742
Excellent story

450
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:07,733
but full of factual errors

451
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:11,636
Errors?

452
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:15,141
How do you know?

453
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:25,987
My name is Phanibhusan Saha

454
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:26,891
Namaste.
