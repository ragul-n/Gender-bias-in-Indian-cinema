2
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:21,934
Mr. Rahim, it would appear that all
these people have been... abandoned.

3
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:24,803
First of all,
not a single day goes by

4
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,806
without the Mayor personally
asking me about Orangi Town.

5
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:31,243
<i>I just got off the phone
with him.</i>

6
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:34,279
<i>Because of the Mayor
and Special Committee,</i>

7
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,282
<i>this isn't a citywide epidemic.</i>

8
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,517
<i>We do understand.</i>

9
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,887
Mr. Craig Evans, his wife,

10
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,691
the most high profile survivor
of the first wave.

11
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,460
How would you describe your
wife's condition at this point?

12
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,929
She's stable,
she's out of intensive care.

13
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,999
Signs are positive,
and the doctors...

14
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:57,302
We are confident that
she's going to get better.

15
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,972
Well, I'm guessing
that the patch is no longer working

16
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,374
<i>- at this stage in the disease.
- No.</i>

17
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,276
<i>She's been put into
an induced coma</i>

18
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,778
<i>in order to limit
her brain activity</i>

19
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,714
<i>to try to stop the virus
from spreading.</i>

20
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,582
She's holding steady, Craig.
We're on track.

21
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,688
Her vitals are strong.
Scans are clear.

22
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,826
When we cut back on the drugs,
we see the difference.

23
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,761
She's fighting it, Craig.

24
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,808
<i>We're still trying
to wrap this up,</i>

25
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,009
<i>but doesn't look like they
want to budge from that number.</i>

26
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:22,047
<i>They've got so much tied up
in that turbine deal.</i>

27
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,384
<i>We're sending Jenson over to the
UAE office to meet with them again.</i>

28
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,019
Okay, keep me in the loop.

29
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,703
When did you
start drinking local?

30
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,805
Since my guy jacked up the prices.

31
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,574
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

32
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,914
Holy shit!

33
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,751
Hey, do you mind looking
at that?

34
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,232
- I think the connection's got cacked out or something.
- Sure.

35
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:04,856
What's this?

36
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,792
Wind energy.

37
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,094
It's the wave
of the future apparently.

38
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,836
Saw you on TV today.

39
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,506
Pretty good.

40
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,012
You know, if you could ever fix a
problem by denying it ever existed,

41
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:29,181
this place would be
a fucking utopia.

42
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,729
<i>Craig.</i>

43
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,766
<i>What are you trying to say?</i>

44
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:53,004
<i>You know I can't
leave this place.</i>

45
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,177
<i>You know how much
my work means to me.</i>

46
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,884
Maybe this place wouldn't
be such a hell hole

47
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:09,221
if you stop treating it like it
was some sort of endurance test.

48
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:24,102
This guy, Farhan...

49
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:28,874
uh, she would borrow his bike to drive
around in the parking lot sometimes.

50
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:32,978
So one day she decides she wants to
take it out in the city for a cruise.

51
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,181
I said, "There's no way
Farhan's letting you do that."

52
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,251
"There's no way he's
going to know," she says.

53
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:42,988
Goes around the first corner
and bang, straight into a car.

54
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,957
And not just any car.
It was a lab instructor.

55
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,927
Luckily, though,
no one got hurt.

56
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,062
But her father had to come in
and calm the whole situation down

57
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,898
and get her out
of some deep shit.

58
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:07,846
I feel like every day
I got to...

59
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,050
find a way to keep
her alive in my mind.

60
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,924
Seeing her...

61
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,894
lying in that bed...

62
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,799
a part of me...

63
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,703
wants to...

64
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,339
forget this place in
my life ever existed.

65
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,620
<i>The cold reality, Vikas.</i>

66
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,723
<i>These are slums with people
living on daily wages.</i>

67
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,961
<i>I've been to this places...</i>

68
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,241
So you just got out of the car?

69
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,078
Yeah.

70
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,880
How close did he come
to taking your head off?

71
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,951
Well, he got a piece.

72
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,319
That's his blood on your shirt.

73
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,829
You're very lucky, though.
The test came back clean.

74
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,095
Hello.

75
00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:35,180
<i>Am I
speaking to Mr. Craig Evans?</i>

76
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,282
Who is this?

77
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:40,218
<i>My name is Amina.</i>

78
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,187
<i>I'm the one who left
those papers.</i>

79
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,422
Yeah. Are you sure
those are for me?

80
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,591
<i>Yes, Mr. Evans.</i>

81
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,361
Why? What is this about?

82
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,430
<i>I need to see you
as soon as possible.</i>

83
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,067
<i>It's about the MN-2.</i>

84
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,452
I apologize you having to come
all this way, Mr. Evans.

85
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,191
My husband's name
is Shehzad Ameen.

86
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,295
He's a reporter for Saiyaara.

87
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:36,034
Yes, I've seen him...
on television.

88
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,570
Three days ago he disappeared.

89
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,209
Shehzad thought he had found
something important.

90
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,211
Proof.

91
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:51,616
- Proof of what?
- I'm not sure.

92
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:55,420
Something about the patch,
the disease.

93
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:58,523
He's been warned
to keep his eyes closed.

94
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,125
Let this pass.

95
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:05,229
But there was no
talking sense into him.

96
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:14,038
Mrs. Ameen, why did you
send me those papers?

97
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:17,241
You have to help me.

98
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,444
My husband's life is in danger.

99
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,280
This story is tragic but...

100
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,982
This is no story, this is real!

101
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,552
This a matter for the police.

102
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:30,488
You're talking about kidnapping
and who knows what else.

103
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,325
You're American.
You can do anything you want.

104
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,995
I saw you on TV, and I said,

105
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:40,098
"This is the only man
who can help me."

106
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,766
You can talk to someone
in your country.

107
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:44,202
- Get to the bottom of all this...
- No!

108
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,607
The police won't help me.

109
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,204
Craig.

110
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,077
Craig.

111
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:37,575
He would go there to work sometimes.
This is the key.

112
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,275
Hello.

113
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,512
Uh, hello.

114
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:22,747
Craig.

115
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,682
I'm a friend of Shehzad's,

116
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:26,050
a friend of the family.

117
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:28,552
I, uh... They gave me the key.

118
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,555
I live across the hall.

119
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,997
Sometimes I would walk in
and it seemed like

120
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,533
he had done nothing
but smoke all night.

121
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:45,503
Other times...

122
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,839
I'd hear voices
from behind the door.

123
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:51,676
Loud voices.

124
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:53,744
Arguments.

125
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,451
That night
that he disappeared...

126
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,421
He wouldn't sit for a minute.

127
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,389
Kept walking around here.

128
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,425
Back and forth, back and forth.

129
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:09,994
Did he mention that he
was going to meet someone?

130
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,062
Maybe a name.

131
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,431
No.

132
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,033
But he did use my cell phone.

133
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,003
He said
he didn't want to use his.

134
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:21,872
May I see it?

135
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:53,371
- Hello.
- My name is Craig Evans.

136
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,906
I'm a friend of Shehzad Ameen.

137
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,455
Now, how is that possible?

138
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:10,508
<i>I'm gonna wait
for the perfect moment.</i>

139
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:18,165
I'm gonna look him in the eye...

140
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:20,326
and I'm gonna tell him
I'm gonna marry his daughter.

141
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:30,728
How's work?

142
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:34,298
It's fine.

143
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,566
Hmm.

144
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:39,169
Garden's looking nice.

145
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,606
Hmm, thank you.

146
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:49,914
I wanna try to get her back.

147
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:52,116
What?

148
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:53,478
I wanna get her back
to the States.

149
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:56,620
Why?

150
00:25:58,024 --> 00:25:59,664
I'll have her looked
at by another doctor.

151
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,158
Do more tests.

152
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:04,061
Get a second opinion.

153
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:05,930
Third.

154
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,799
Doctors here aren't white,

155
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,701
but that doesn't mean
they're no good.

156
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:13,270
Rias is our top man.

157
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:16,106
There's no one more qualified
than him to take care of her.

158
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,588
Maybe there's something
we're missing.

159
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:21,612
It's not convenient for you
to be here

160
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,748
with your work and travel.

161
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,883
But I don't see what that has
to do with my daughter.

162
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:27,618
What if we're getting locked
into something

163
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,687
without knowing
all the possibilities first?

164
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:30,955
What possibilities?

165
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:32,990
You think I haven't explored
all of them?

166
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:34,325
You think that I would
just leave her

167
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:36,561
in some hospital hoping
for the best?

168
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,796
If there is a chance,
if there is a fraction of a chance...

169
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,066
No one can give her the care and
attention she's getting here.

170
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,170
She's not going anywhere...

171
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,372
in case I wasn't clear.

172
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,376
Hello.

173
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:26,677
<i>Who is this?</i>

174
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:29,147
I've been trying to reach you.

175
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:31,949
<i>How do you know Shehzad?</i>

176
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:34,785
Who am I speaking to?

177
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:36,420
<i>Shehzad, how do you know him?</i>

178
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:38,122
<i>Where did you get these papers?</i>

179
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:41,091
I'm a friend.
His wife gave them to me.

180
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:43,293
You know where Shehzad is?

181
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:45,229
<i>No.</i>

182
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:46,864
Did you give him these papers?

183
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,799
<i>I, I, I can't talk to you
on this phone.</i>

184
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,235
Then where?

185
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:40,217
I was working at Ingenec
at that time.

186
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:48,759
I can't remember
who recommended him.

187
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,078
I remember

188
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,719
somebody that knew me,
called me up and...

189
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:55,799
wanted me to meet this guy

190
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,901
who was doing the story
on pharmaceuticals...

191
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,103
for some news channel.

192
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,790
He really knew

193
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:04,631
how to make somebody feel
like a piece of shit.

194
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:08,479
He had a real gift for it.

195
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,219
Farooq.

196
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:16,954
Don't you see
what's going on here?

197
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:19,289
Do the right thing.

198
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:25,329
The night he disappeared...

199
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:26,930
he talked to you, right?

200
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,265
Yeah, he called.

201
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,977
He knew they were on to him.

202
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:42,780
He knew he was over,
he had nowhere to go.

203
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,181
And do you know
what happened to him?

204
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:45,249
No.

205
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:47,885
But I can guess.

206
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:59,062
This is about the drug tests,

207
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:00,931
the clinical trials.

208
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,332
That's all in the early days.

209
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:04,454
That's irrelevant.
That's just the tip of the iceberg.

210
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,131
Shehzad had found out that...

211
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
that they had found the cure.

212
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,413
Please.

213
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:47,377
Hmm.

214
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,475
You're going to need a lot
more evidence

215
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:21,078
for a story like this.

216
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,980
Some time ago,
he came up with a story.

217
00:31:23,616 --> 00:31:25,349
A corrupt government official,

218
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:26,617
very high ranking,

219
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,552
accepting a bribe in some

220
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,520
highway construction scandal.

221
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,055
It was a spicy story.

222
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,123
Made a big splash.

223
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,325
Put him on the map.

224
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,329
Except for one thing.

225
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:41,265
He made it all up.

226
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:44,501
You see, around here, everyone,

227
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,970
from the ministers
to the tea boy think that they

228
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:49,940
understand the root
of this country's problems.

229
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:52,109
Shit doesn't just happen
around here.

230
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:55,145
Everything is part of some
masterplan.

231
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:58,048
And Shehzad...

232
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,917
He just gives the viewers
what they want.

233
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,085
There is no conspiracy.

234
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,221
No cure.

235
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,357
And this sort of talk is...

236
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:09,092
dangerous.

237
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:20,537
Mr. Evans, Mr. Evans.

238
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:26,310
I'm Mariam.

239
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:28,078
I work on Waqas's show.

240
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:27,270
I'm the one who gave
Amina your contact information.

241
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:34,077
Those rigged trials...

242
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:37,381
that is what this is about,
right?

243
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:40,684
Did you find anything,
anything more?

244
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,352
You want Shehzad's story.

245
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,189
I'm just trying to help.

246
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,058
In exchange for whatever
I can find out.

247
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:50,227
I saw Shehzad.

248
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:55,165
<i>Sultan, the head guy
from Ingenec was there.</i>

249
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:58,769
Excuse me, excuse me.

250
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:20,357
I did catch this one name.

251
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:23,060
Jarvis.

252
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,883
<i>Shehzad Ameen's body was found</i>

253
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:21,618
<i>in the early hours
of the morning.</i>

254
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,220
<i>Tests have confirmed the traces</i>

255
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:24,754
<i>of the virus in Amin's blood.</i>

256
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:26,823
<i>And the police have stated
there is little doubt</i>

257
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:29,226
<i>that Amin was also a victim
of such an attack.</i>

258
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:31,728
<i>The time of death
has been put at</i>

259
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,864
<i>approximately,
1:00 a.m. last night.</i>

260
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,640
Sir, just one minute.
Sir, just one minute.

261
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:11,014
And I have every reason
to believe

262
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,736
that their results were accurate.
Thank you.

263
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:17,854
I have nothing to add.

264
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,590
I have nothing more to add.
Now get the hell out of here.

265
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:24,861
<i>Damn it.</i>

266
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,697
<i>Sir, please, sir.
Just two minutes.</i>

267
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:40,110
The hell.

268
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,051
Hello.

269
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:49,619
<i>Craig.</i>

270
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:50,787
Farooq?

271
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,088
<i>Something's come up.</i>

272
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,591
<i>About Shehzad,
about this whole mess.</i>

273
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:56,926
<i>Come to my place right now.</i>

274
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,327
I don't understand
what you're saying.

275
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:55,992
Can you help me?

276
00:44:57,095 --> 00:44:58,861
Can you help me get out of here?

277
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:00,963
Please?

278
00:45:53,518 --> 00:45:54,851
Rehan!

279
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:56,813
Good.

280
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:25,975
Hello?

281
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:27,310
- Fahad.
<i>- Craig.</i>

282
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:28,377
<i>Holy shit,
where the hell are you?</i>

283
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:30,613
I'm fine, I'm safe. Listen.

284
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:32,848
I need you to go to my place,
grab some of my things, then, come meet me

285
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:34,617
by the beach,
behind the train tracks.

286
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,319
<i>Get me some clothes, too.</i>

287
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:37,386
Done.

288
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:39,682
Fucking rat!

289
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:42,685
You'll never be like them.

290
00:48:42,687 --> 00:48:44,453
You'll always be a sewer rat.

291
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:47,556
To be used and thrown away.

292
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:41,510
<i>Ingenec is running a program</i>

293
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:42,645
called Jarvis.

294
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,364
Uh-huh.

295
00:49:44,365 --> 00:49:46,082
Would you mind telling me
what the hell's going on?

296
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:49,652
Here, here. You see this?
Right here. Look.

297
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:52,588
Jarvis is the code name
for the MN-2 research program.

298
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,123
It's where they
developed the patch

299
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:55,291
and the cure.

300
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:56,392
The what?

301
00:49:56,394 --> 00:49:58,027
Did you just say "cure"?

302
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,164
I could save her.

303
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:17,013
Charming. Who lives here, man?

304
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:19,281
Oh. Okay.

305
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:22,678
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

306
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:34,590
Mariam, where are you right now?

307
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:40,529
<i>This is off the record. Yes.</i>

308
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:42,698
<i>But let's start being
honest with each other.</i>

309
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:48,804
<i>So, when was this?</i>

310
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:51,841
<i>About four years ago.</i>

311
00:51:51,843 --> 00:51:55,411
<i>There had been some cases
outside the city.</i>

312
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:57,279
<i>Some in the northern areas.</i>

313
00:51:59,584 --> 00:52:01,283
<i>People dismissed it.</i>

314
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,719
<i>As if it was a hoax.</i>

315
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:05,788
<i>An aberration.</i>

316
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:09,391
<i>No one was keeping track...</i>

317
00:52:10,862 --> 00:52:12,661
<i>until it exploded.</i>

318
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:22,171
<i>They finally hit upon
a formula where...</i>

319
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:25,608
<i>it would control the symptoms
for short periods of time.</i>

320
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:27,810
<i>The violence...</i>

321
00:52:29,547 --> 00:52:31,814
<i>bursts of aggression.</i>

322
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,829
I had already submitted
an internal report

323
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:49,832
which detailed the progress.

324
00:52:52,236 --> 00:52:54,503
It was all very satisfactory.

325
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:01,744
But they did tell you
to stop, didn't they?

326
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:07,650
Not in those words, but yes.

327
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:11,754
I found out...

328
00:53:12,757 --> 00:53:14,924
that the drug
would be held back.

329
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,526
For how long?

330
00:53:17,929 --> 00:53:19,428
I don't know.

331
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:22,965
Maybe forever.

332
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:28,837
<i>The cure was destroyed.</i>

333
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:36,645
What do we do now?

334
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:38,647
I don't know.

335
00:53:50,494 --> 00:53:52,394
I could have made that for you.

336
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:53,562
It's all right.

337
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:55,297
I've already made it.

338
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,466
Are you hungry?

339
00:53:57,468 --> 00:53:59,868
You hardly ate
anything at dinner.

340
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:01,604
Just wanted some tea.

341
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:11,413
<i>With more than
13,000 now dead in Pakistan</i>

342
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:12,881
<i>and cases emerging globally,</i>

343
00:54:12,883 --> 00:54:15,701
<i>the price of Sedare
is sky-rocketing.</i>

344
00:54:15,702 --> 00:54:18,520
<i>Ingenec's stock prices have risen
faster than any company in history</i>

345
00:54:18,522 --> 00:54:22,291
<i>along with rumors swirling
of a massive U.S. takeover.</i>

346
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:26,295
<i>Mr. Sultan, the company is making
hundreds of millions in profit daily.</i>

347
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:27,896
<i>Is this not unethical?</i>

348
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:36,538
<i>We have doubled
the efforts to find a cure,</i>

349
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,491
<i>a permanent solution.</i>

350
00:54:39,492 --> 00:54:42,443
<i>We're also doing our best to deal
with the high demand of Sedare.</i>

351
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:45,014
<i>Our factories are running
day and night.</i>

352
00:54:45,016 --> 00:54:46,548
Good night, dear.

353
00:54:47,051 --> 00:54:48,684
I'll be up soon.

354
00:55:15,346 --> 00:55:18,580
Neutral brain activity
was her only defense.

355
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:25,421
It's adapting to the treatment,
becoming active again.

356
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:29,758
We will lose her
in two or three weeks.

357
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,841
Her mother died of cancer.

358
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:22,845
I know.

359
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:29,818
The chemo stripped everything.

360
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:35,057
Her left side, you know, here...

361
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:38,060
they had to cut away.

362
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:43,966
Insiya, she would clean her...

363
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,502
feed her...

364
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:48,804
talk to her.

365
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:55,577
One day,
she said she's made up her mind.

366
00:56:57,948 --> 00:56:59,982
She's going to be a doctor.

367
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:10,092
Everything that I built...

368
00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:13,162
was for them.

369
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:17,666
Yet in the end...

370
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,170
I could save neither.

371
00:57:45,663 --> 00:57:47,663
Time to leave it for Imtiaz.

372
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:28,897
Hello?

373
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:32,067
<i>My name is Imtiaz.</i>

374
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,902
<i>You've been looking for me.</i>

375
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:05,601
What is this place?

376
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:07,603
Our latest research facility.

377
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:10,205
A payoff for my loyalty.

378
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,046
It wasn't supposed
to get to this.

379
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:27,923
<i>This virus...</i>

380
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:31,994
it has these...

381
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:34,930
amazing properties.

382
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:42,638
Research that could lead
to unbelievable breakthroughs.

383
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:59,688
And they told me
I could do whatever I wanted.

384
01:01:00,924 --> 01:01:04,126
<i>All I had to do was
keep my mouth shut...</i>

385
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,199
and my eyes closed.

386
01:01:20,778 --> 01:01:22,177
Let a few people die.

387
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,183
The hubris of an old man...

388
01:01:30,387 --> 01:01:31,787
I gave in...

389
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:37,993
for a chance at a legacy.

390
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:46,301
What about this cure?

391
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:29,111
Mmm.

392
01:02:57,808 --> 01:02:58,907
Nasir.

393
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:29,838
Here.

394
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:53,361
All these specimens are
beyond phase three.

395
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:59,100
Kept alive so we can...

396
01:04:00,237 --> 01:04:01,970
study the mutations.

397
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:04,439
Human Petri dishes.

398
01:04:27,164 --> 01:04:28,330
This is it.

399
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:30,599
Yes.

400
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:57,559
This was the only batch
I could save.

401
01:04:58,562 --> 01:04:59,628
Take it.

402
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,910
This way.

403
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:20,615
Go for God's sake.

404
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:23,418
Otherwise, we both die.

405
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:26,534
He's dead!

406
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:31,739
No!

407
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:29,230
Get him, dog.

408
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:22,423
- <i>Hey, where are you?</i>
- I'm at the hospital.

409
01:11:22,646 --> 01:11:24,712
<i>How's the arm?</i>

410
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:27,482
I'll live. Listen, is everything
in place for tonight?

411
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:29,951
<i>Uh, yes.</i>

412
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,819
What?

413
01:11:33,023 --> 01:11:34,989
<i>Is this how you want to do it?</i>

414
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:37,725
Do I have to walk you
through this again?

415
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,728
<i>Okay, never mind.
Everything's good. Don't worry.</i>

416
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:42,397
Wait for my word.

417
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:48,670
I think you should
go away for a while.

418
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:50,538
Stay with somebody.
Preferably, out of town.

419
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:52,507
I'm not going anywhere,
Mr. Evans.

420
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:56,911
This is my house,
my family home.

421
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:02,850
He died fighting
for what was right.

422
01:12:08,091 --> 01:12:09,541
He just ran out of time.

423
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:11,622
And I saw him finally become
the man he wanted to be.

424
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,363
That's the gift he left for me.

425
01:12:16,599 --> 01:12:17,665
For Sara.

426
01:14:00,637 --> 01:14:02,069
Somebody help me!

427
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:04,705
Somebody help!
It's okay, come on.

428
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:02,930
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

429
01:15:02,932 --> 01:15:04,232
My lawyer will answer, okay?

430
01:15:09,072 --> 01:15:10,838
<i>And staying with our main story,</i>

431
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,825
<i>the follow continues at Ingenec.</i>

432
01:15:13,826 --> 01:15:16,811
<i>In a secretly recorded interview,
the company's top scientist alleges.</i>

433
01:15:16,813 --> 01:15:19,614
<i>Ingenec kept the MN-2 cure
off the market</i>

434
01:15:19,616 --> 01:15:22,116
<i>in an effort to maximize sales
of the patch.</i>

435
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:24,652
<i>This comes just days after
the company was sold</i>

436
01:15:24,654 --> 01:15:27,021
<i>to an American
pharmaceutical group.</i>

437
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:30,124
<i>There is now speculation that
this was somehow part of the deal.</i>

438
01:15:30,126 --> 01:15:33,194
<i>If the drug was held back at
the behest of the new owners...</i>

439
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:02,023
<i>Meanwhile,
experts warn the drug still needs</i>

440
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:04,025
<i>to go through rigorous tests.</i>

441
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:06,827
<i>There's no evidence yet
that this is a complete cure.</i>

442
01:16:06,829 --> 01:16:11,065
<i>The virus is highly resistant and
come back after a period of dormancy.</i>

443
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:13,701
<i>The World Health Organization
has advised extre...</i>

444
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:23,050
