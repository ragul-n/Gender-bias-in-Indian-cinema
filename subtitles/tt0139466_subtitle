You Tube search name - Miss Mary

3
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,520
Laxmi School is dedicated
to my missing daughter Laxmi.

4
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,630
This school is as dear to me
as the children are to their parents.

5
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,450
On its 16th anniversary today,
you will be glad to know that...

6
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,590
I'm going to upgrade our primary
school to middle grade.

7
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:09,960
To manage which, I have advertised
for a graduate husband and wife.

8
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,190
I hope my efforts bear fruit.

9
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,190
Ma, was Laxmi a prankster like me?

10
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,990
No, dear. She was very soft.

11
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,670
Where's Raju?
He's such a careless boy.

12
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,866
He didn't even attend the school's
anniversary function today.

13
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:47,810
Father, he must be somewhere searching
for sister Laxmi with his binoculars.

14
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,640
Your favorite nephew,
lndia's number one detective...

15
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,430
would do nothing but look for Laxmi.

16
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:03,330
- What kind of getup is this?
- Sorry. Actually, I found them...

17
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,060
- Who are they?
- This man says the girl is our Laxmi.

18
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,520
- No, she can't be our Laxmi.
- Aunt, take a look at this locket.

19
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,200
- Did it belong to Laxmi?
- No, this isn't the one.

20
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,850
I doubted it. Do take a look
at the mole on her leg.

21
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,730
- Please do.
- Laxmi had a mole on her right leg.

22
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,760
- Not on the left.
- Sir, when she was a kid...

23
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,350
the mole was on her right leg. As she
grew up, the mole shifted to her left.

24
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,950
- Like a train shuttling, well?
- Where did you find these imposters?

25
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,090
Throw them out! Bloody detective!

26
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:50,070
Chicken! What are you watching?
Get out of here! Or, I'll turn you in.

27
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,930
Get lost!

28
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,660
Chandragupta, you're useless.
I told you this girl is a fake!

29
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,090
Today, because of you,
the number one detective is disgraced.

30
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,870
- Yes...
- Shut up!

31
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,130
Aunt, give me a proper
description of Laxmi.

32
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,270
I'll place an advertisement again
in the newspapers. God willing...

33
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,360
we'll find our Laxmi
and the teachers at the same time.

34
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,750
Chandragupta, ass, write it down.
Go on, Aunt.

35
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,380
Laxmi was a real goddess.
She was true to her name.

36
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,630
When she went missing, she had a
leaf-shaped locket around her neck.

37
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,420
She had a beautiful mole
on her right leg.

38
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,900
My friend, listen...

39
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:04,290
to the cuckoo sing out there

40
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,660
So sweet is her voice...

41
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,000
it strums my heartstrings

42
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,730
When she hears someone
calling out to her lover...

43
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,710
her forlorn heart cries

44
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,750
It reminds her over and over...

45
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,650
of the lovelier times she spent

46
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,090
Miss Mary, I'm sorry,
I've been suddenly transferred.

47
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,290
Here's your fees.
We're leaving tomorrow.

48
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,560
- Leaving?
- Yes, must follow the Center's order.

49
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,880
- I hope you have another job at hand.
- No, this was the only one I had.

50
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,450
I see. Would you like
to do office work?

51
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,140
- Sure.
- One of my friends informed me that...

52
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,940
he needs some clerks at his office.
If you want, I can recommend you.

53
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,250
- Please do, I'll be obliged, sir.
- It's all right.

54
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,650
Here's the recommendation letter.
I'm sure you'll get the job.

55
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,420
I must say Kiran has a sweet voice.
Please let her continue her training.

56
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,910
Sure.

57
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,590
Mohan! Mohan!

58
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:23,020
- Sorry. isn't Mohan in?
- He is. He's getting ready.

59
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,140
Mr. Arun, I've been transferred.
We're leaving tomorrow.

60
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,990
Leaving tomorrow?
Well, no problem.

61
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,240
Coming and going is part of life.
Government servants like you...

62
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,740
keep getting transferred, and people
like me keep looking for jobs.

63
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,280
If you don't mind, please
recommend me to any of your friends.

64
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,150
- I'll be obliged.
- I've already written a letter.

65
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,580
Here it is, and take your fees too.

66
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,360
- You didn't take long.
- He sent me out.

67
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,310
But you too are sailing
in the same boat as I am.

68
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,090
That's right.

69
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,520
He must've surely given you
a recommendation letter.

70
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,140
- Oh no, I never asked for one.
- Good. Saved your honor.

71
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,500
I unabashedly asked for one.
The poor don't get a hearing.

72
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,900
He flatly refused.
Well, God will provide me.

73
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,120
- Where are you going anyway?
- Home. I stay at Bandra.

74
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,720
Bandra? You're on the wrong side then.
Buses to Bandra go from that bus stand.

75
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,500
- This one goes to Fort.
- I know, but before going home...

76
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,510
I'll drop by the hospital
to see my friend who is ill.

77
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,390
- Where are you headed?
- Santacruz.

78
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,650
Santacruz? Then what are you doing
here? Your bus too goes from there.

79
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,910
Yes, but I have to buy medicine
from Fort. My grandma is very ill.

80
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,636
- Only one seat.
- My friend is suffering, please.

81
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,150
Look, my grandma is dying. Just think,
you can make thousands of friends.

82
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,800
- But you don't find too many grannys.
- Relax, and make up your mind.

83
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,140
- Look, my friend...
- My grandma! Sorry, grandma.

84
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,610
It'll take six more months
to extend the business.

85
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,020
Why don't you drop in after a year?

86
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,160
- Excuse, do come next year.
- Sure, if I'm alive.

87
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,270
Be seated, please.

88
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,330
What would you like?
Tea? Or coffee?

89
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,030
Bring a glass of cold water.

90
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,710
You see, I'm moved
when I see a jobless person.

91
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,070
- What do you say?
- You are right.

92
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,480
Some people think, by setting up
new schools and colleges...

93
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,360
the government is invariably helping
unemployment rise. What do you think?

94
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,810
- That's right.
- That's where you're wrong.

95
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,180
If the water dries up,
it's not the well's fault.

96
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,530
Every young person ought
to acquire education...

97
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,830
before they think
of eradicating unemployment.

98
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,730
After much efforts, I've come up with
a solution to this horrible problem.

99
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,550
- Would you like to hear?
- Tell me.

100
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,900
- Drink some water.
- No, thanks.

101
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,680
- Please.
- No, thanks.

102
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:18,720
Fine, listen. Young girls and boys
who are going to inherit property...

103
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:25,350
must not race for jobs. That would
cut down unemployment by a quarter

104
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,440
- Aren't I right?
- Right.

105
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,320
Likewise, working young men
should marry jobless young women...

106
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,420
and working girls
should marry jobless men.

107
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,060
That would cut down the country's
unemployment by another quarter.

108
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:47,980
That means half the unemployment
problem is solved.

109
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,770
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Yes, yes.

110
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:56,760
That leaves the poor men. They'd rather
look for rich girls than look for jobs.

111
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,280
If all the poor men
are married to rich girls...

112
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,690
then three-quarters of unemployment
will be eliminated.

113
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,100
Now for the remaining quarter, they'll
manage to find jobs somewhere some way.

114
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,920
- What do you say?
- Wonderful idea.

115
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,200
It's a phenomenal idea,
but you got it.

116
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:20,550
What you must now do is, go and
find yourself a rich or a working man.

117
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,740
- Need some cold water?
- No, thanks

118
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,840
Excuse me! It's a priceless idea,
so make the most of it.

119
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,050
Are you married?

120
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,100
- I'm still young.
- Why not try me?

121
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,910
- You?
- Idiot!

122
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,840
Mary has gone for the tuition, John.
She should be here any moment.

123
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,440
- Get some tea for John.
- Father, I don't feel like it.

124
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,180
Father, I wish to tell you something.

125
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:30,640
It's very sensitive and
I feel very embarrassed to say it.

126
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,040
I'm embarrassed too. It's been six
months since I borrowed money from you.

127
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,790
- It's not about that.
- No good keeping the truth, John.

128
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:46,290
I'm looking for a job.
I'll repay you as soon as I get one.

129
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,830
Not money, the purpose of my visit
is something else.

130
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,270
I've fallen in love with Mary.

131
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,270
I keep getting proposals
from faraway places...

132
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:08,310
via messengers, via post,
via telegram, by air.

133
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:15,060
- Why don't you talk to Mary about me?
- She knows what's good and bad for her.

134
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,320
Talk to her. If she is willing,
we have no problems.

135
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:23,729
- No doubt, no doubt.
- Have tea.

136
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,460
Insult! Humiliation! Dishonor!
Did you see that?

137
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,330
I did, Mr John.
In fact, you are very impatient

138
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,650
lmpatient? I've been holding myself
back for the last six months.

139
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,770
No more! I can't wait one more day.
I can't wait one moment.

140
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:06,020
Either return my money
or get Mary married to me.

141
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,670
Have patience, John. I can't
get Mary married against her wishes.

142
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,430
As for your money,
I'll return it to you anyway.

143
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:26,030
No Mary, no delay. I'll sue you, and
get every thing in this house auctioned.

144
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,360
Papa, we've had too much. Why don't you
sell this locket and just pay him off?

145
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,340
Forgive me, Mary. I'm a fool.

146
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,240
Not my fault though.
The devil rode on me.

147
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,280
I don't want the money.
I hate money, I love you.

148
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:54,210
- If you say, I'll lend you more.
- I need neither your money nor you.

149
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,720
As for your money, we'll deliver it
as soon as we have it.

150
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,480
Don't be furious, Mary.
I'll come back tomorrow.

151
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,620
How long will this jerk continue
to harass us, Papa?

152
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,160
Why don't you sell my locket
and get him off your back?

153
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,350
No dear, you must
never sell the locket.

154
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:27,700
My child, you don't know its worth.
This is the very locket...

155
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,610
- that lit up our house.
- I don't understand. I'm a Christian.

156
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,390
Why does my locket
hold a picture of Hindu deities?

157
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,610
All religions are the same.
You must respect all religions.

158
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:44,740
I shared your ideas before, but ever
since you stepped into our house...

159
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,210
I have fallen in love
with all religions.

160
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,730
Every river meets the ocean.

161
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,780
Likewise, every religion leads man
to the same destination...

162
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:00,730
no matter what you call Him,
Allah, God or Bhagwan.

163
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,666
Money matters more than God,
so let me have some of it

164
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:34,890
Give me a coin...
a quarter, a fifty, or a cent

165
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,860
This blind man who can see,
sells tickets to heaven

166
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,890
Man, grab one quickly!
Only a few seats are left

167
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,940
Life is short, so you'd better
understand your instincts

168
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:30,100
And let me have
a quarter, a fifty, or a cent

169
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,950
Money matters more than God,
so let me have some of it

170
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:43,190
Give me a coin,
a quarter, a fifty, or a cent

171
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:07,060
Charity washeth away
the sins of lifetimes

172
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,960
Give away a little,
and you will earn much more

173
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,576
What's there to think about,
oh ignorant ones? It's a smooth deal

174
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:25,290
So let me have some of it,
a quarter, a fifty or a cent

175
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:32,040
Money matters more than God,
so let me have some of it

176
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:38,400
Give me a coin,
a quarter, a fifty, or a cent

177
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,940
The Lord Almighty is innocent
and His ways are mysterious

178
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:07,120
He only manifests before him
who digs into his pockets

179
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,826
I'm the Almighty's servant,
let me recommend your salvation

180
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:19,870
So give me some,
a quarter, a fifty or a cent

181
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:26,720
Money matters more than God,
so let me have some of it

182
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:33,410
Give me a coin,
a quarter, a fifty, or a cent

183
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,360
Wanted Column?

184
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,500
Right, friend. Even I used to read
sports columns when I was in college.

185
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,940
But after graduation, my eyes stick
nowhere else but on the vacancy column.

186
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,640
- Excuse me, you don't have a job?
- I do. Road Inspector

187
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,110
- I see. Jobless.
- I have run from pillar to post.

188
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,470
But these days, finding a job
is tougher than milking stone.

189
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:29,690
You're right, sir. But the truth is you
chaps only know how to read and write.

190
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,790
Along with knowledge,
you need to be tactful too.

191
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,150
No doubt. How much do you manage
to earn in a day?

192
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:43,560
The market is quite dull of late. The
rich hesitate to dig into their pockets.

193
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,690
Even then, after food, drinks
and cinema, I get to keep a few bucks.

194
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,620
- Why don't you do this?
- Do what?

195
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:58,090
Make a nice box of tin, put a hole
through it and cover it in print.

196
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,160
- Print what?
- I'll tell you.

197
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,420
Write that, in so and so place
an ancient temple has been found...

198
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:13,840
and it needs donations. And believe me
people will pour money into it.

199
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,460
- You will be richer.
- Hang on. I've found it.

200
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,836
- Found what?
- A job. Laxmi Middle School...

201
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,120
needs graduate teachers.

202
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,240
Gone.

203
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,530
- Who's gone?
- The job.

204
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:38,710
- Amazing. That was one quick exit.
- Well, they need a married couple.

205
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:44,220
Not my cup of tea. That's why they say
that fate is the other name of wife.

206
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,836
Now where am I to find a graduate lady
who'll agree to marry me?

207
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,260
- What you do is...
- Wait a second.

208
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,480
Lady, I'm a blind man.
Give me a dime or two.

209
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,760
Shut up. She's also like me,
inspects roads. Go on.

210
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,380
Sorry, I lied for the sake
of survival. But I couldn't make it.

211
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,700
Please be seated, come.

212
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,020
Be seated.

213
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,950
To begin with, that chap spoke big.
Then he just shoved me out.

214
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:24,270
I was so dazed that I gulped down
a whole glass of water before I left.

215
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:29,240
That scum! I didn't drink water,
in fact I made him drink it.

216
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:35,830
- Great. I guess you're a graduate.
- I am. Saint Xavier's College.

217
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,140
Who cares about the college? There's
an advertisement that's no good for me.

218
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:43,540
Maybe it'll work things for you.
Up there.

219
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,220
Nonsense. This is ridiculous.
Not every teacher is married.

220
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,510
You're right. Besides,
I'm not mad to get married.

221
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,520
- I got an idea. May I?
- Go ahead.

222
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,150
Don't take offense please,
because I say it with a good heart.

223
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:06,080
Look, if you're in love
with a graduate, then get married.

224
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,990
- You'll get the job pronto.
- Thank you. I don't want to marry!

225
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:20,290
There's a way out. You'll be able
to repay the loan in two months...

226
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,150
and we'll both have jobs too.
After that you can quit if you wish.

227
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,830
- But where's the job?
- I'll tell you.

228
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,430
Haste is waste. What do you say?

229
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,100
You're right.

230
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:40,410
You see, I'm in pretty bad shape.
Unless I find a job soon...

231
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,480
I'll be reduced to begging. If I'm not
mistaken, your state too, is like mine.

232
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,240
- Stop joking.
- No, I'm serious.

233
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,030
A man in need does anything
just to feed himself.

234
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,140
Would you mind if we put on an act
for sometime for the sake of livelihood?

235
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:00,490
- You want me to join the theater?
- Oh no. You don't understand.

236
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,890
What I mean is,
life is a stage too.

237
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,930
For the sake of our jobs, if the
two of us could... I mean, we...

238
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,110
- you and I...
- Be explicit! Why do you stutter?

239
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:16,710
I'm saying it, but please
consider it before you refuse.

240
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,540
For getting the jobs,
why don't we play...

241
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,930
- husband and wife?
- What?

242
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,910
- It's only an act.
- You can't trust a person anymore.

243
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,750
Now, you're acting in haste.
I told you to give it a good thought.

244
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,790
Think about it with a cool head.
If you sinks in, meet me here.

245
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,650
- This is my latest address.
- Thanks.

246
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:45,930
No good, guru. You still have time.
A tin box, a hole in it...

247
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,810
- and a printed paper stuck on it.
- Forget it. I've hit the bullseye.

248
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:54,500
- How's that, guru?
- A girl's acceptance is refusal...

249
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:59,660
- and refusal is acceptance. She's game.
- Hats off to you, guru. I got it.

250
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,620
When a girl agrees, she doesn't really.
When she refuses, she actually agrees.

251
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:09,750
- What's that?
- I change getup like a girl does.

252
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,061
I never imagined Johnny would
turn out to be such a crook.

253
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,160
Had I not borrowed money from him, you
wouldn't have had to bear such shame.

254
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:29,090
What good regretting now, Papa?
We have to repay him anyway.

255
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:37,860
Papa, there was an advertisement
seeking a teacher. Rs 250 per month.

256
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,880
But the place is 200 miles
away from here.

257
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:47,200
Papa, if you approve,
I'll apply for it.

258
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:54,600
Impossible, Mary. Not even a moment
have we kept you away from our eyes.

259
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,400
How can we send you so far away?

260
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:05,100
Mummy, at least let me work for two
months, just to repay the scum's loan.

261
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:12,110
- Papa, please tell Mummy...
- My child, we've never refused you.

262
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,310
As you wish.

263
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:32,270
- Excuse me...
- Please! Give me a coin or two.

264
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:37,120
- Skip it. Where's that man?
- Oh, it's you! Sorry.

265
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,950
Guru went to get something typed.
Stay here, I'll be right back with him.

266
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,280
Be seated.

267
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,110
Please sit.

268
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:05,170
Actually, I thought over it all night.
Your idea is good in a way.

269
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,210
Of course. ldeas make the world
go round. You read the Bible, right?

270
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,810
- Nature is one of God's ideas.
- Have you read the Bible?

271
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:18,050
In fact, I have read Scriptures
of almost all religions.

272
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:23,210
- You and I don't know each other well.
- What's the need to know more?

273
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,990
At our first meeting I figured
you were from a decent family.

274
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:33,280
As for myself, you feel
the same too, I guess?

275
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,730
Could be. But I've been deceived
so many times that...

276
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:42,380
You don't want to be deceived anymore?
I assure you I won't ever deceive you.

277
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,670
If you want, I can show you
my conduct certificate.

278
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:49,900
No need. But still,
I don't feel like it.

279
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,230
For decisions like this, you use
your brain over your heart.

280
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:56,870
You're right. That's why
I wish to betray my heart.

281
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:02,100
For two months, I'll try
to act as your... your...

282
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,330
No need to say it. I understand.

283
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,990
I'll be drawing 200 per month
and you'll be drawing 250.

284
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,920
On the basis of salaries,
you'll be the man and I your wife.

285
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,900
So prepare the application,
I'll sign it.

286
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,330
- There's something else I wish to say.
- I understand.

287
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,740
You don't need to be afraid
of anything. If you want...

288
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,090
I'm willing to go to the church
and take an oath.

289
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:27,080
- You go to church too?
- Temples, mosques, God, devil...

290
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,120
- I believe in everything.
- Maybe...

291
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,120
- but I trust only the Merciful Christ.
- Wonderful.

292
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:40,360
- Sign it, please.
- Look, we'll be no more than friends.

293
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:46,390
Trust me. We'll be acting man and wife
only to keep our jobs secured.

294
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,510
- As for the...
- It's okay. I don't wish to hear more.

295
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:55,270
- I feel embarrassed.
- All right, just sign it.

296
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,420
So you prepared
the application in advance?

297
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,350
Mrs. Arun.

298
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,070
- Now let me have an anna.
- An anna?

299
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,640
Half the cost of the stamp.
It's just business.

300
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,760
As for the expenses,
to each his own.

301
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,000
If you come home,
I'll introduce you to my Papa.

302
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:27,770
- But you can't reveal anything.
- I'm not that stupid.

303
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,040
- Cash?
- Yes?

304
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,900
- Post this letter for me.
- Guru, this is stupid.

305
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,926
Let's go to the beach this evening
and put up a nice triplet show.

306
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,850
- We'll make money. Forget about this.
- Don't!

307
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,610
- He's an interesting person.
- You've found a nice friend indeed.

308
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,180
Guru, make sure you come back soon.
I'll be back soon too.

309
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,040
I'm off on a business trip.

310
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,850
Father.

311
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,130
Raju, did we receive more applications?

312
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,320
- One, uncle.
- Married couple?

313
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:08,270
- Yes.
- Good. Wire them to come at once.

314
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:12,980
But they're very young. They don't
seem to have much experience.

315
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,520
You don't have to poke that
detective nose in everything.

316
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,200
Experience, or no experience,
at least they are graduates.

317
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,550
Besides, they're married.
What more do we ask for?

318
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,220
- Right, Father.
- Wire them at once. Go.

319
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,819
Wait!

320
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:35,080
Also send them 100 bucks for the fare.
They may not have it. Understand?

321
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,460
Yes uncle.

322
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,390
Excuse me, any letter for Mr. Arun?

323
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,139
- Address?
- Postmaster.

324
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:50,919
- There's a money order.
- Oh! Thanks.

325
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,590
Praise the Lord

326
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,370
Praise the Lord.

327
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,740
- In the name of the Lord, give me alms.
- Go away. Aren't you ashamed to beg?

328
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,640
You're a robust man.
Why don't you do some labor?

329
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:16,070
Sir, I asked for alms, not advice.
If you have money, give me.

330
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,230
- Else, get lost.
- Hey, it's you!

331
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:22,170
- I am. Let go of my hand.
- I won't.

332
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,810
- Why not?
- How long will you con the world?

333
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,060
I've found a job.
Why don't you come with me?

334
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:32,186
- Now guru, don't drag me among thorns.
- Don't you want a job?

335
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,660
- Not at all.
- Why not?

336
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,571
- What does a job provide anyway?
- Begging commands respect, does it?

337
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,220
No, but life is fun. Can't you see?
Everyday I get into a new getup...

338
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:46,670
and con people. Today I'm a cripple,
tomorrow a blind man.

339
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,740
Every day is innovative.
You make money and also enjoy.

340
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:54,760
- A job can't buy you that much.
- But how long will the con job work?

341
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,520
If the government finds out,
you'll end up in jail.

342
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:03,840
Nonsense. Why would the government
pick a fight with beggars?

343
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,440
You have no idea, Cash.
A new law is about to be enforced.

344
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,120
Any person found begging will be
caught and put among beggars.

345
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,100
The police will force them to work.

346
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,610
- Honestly, guru?
- Yes, it was in the papers yesterday.

347
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,660
In that case, I'm willing
to go with you.

348
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:25,240
Fine, I'll take you along, but you
won' play any tricks with us.

349
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,640
No way, guru.
I'll find many other fools there.

350
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,930
All right.
You'll pick up Mary this evening.

351
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,020
Keep this.

352
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,640
Excuse me. what's all this?

353
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,890
- Aren't you Mr. Arun?
- You're mistaken.

354
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,940
Am I?

355
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,200
- Are you Mr Arun?
- Yes.

356
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,540
- Isn't your wife with you?
- She is.

357
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:31,280
I was mistaken. You got off different
coaches, so I thought otherwise.

358
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,010
- No, she is my wife.
- I brought garlands for you,

359
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,520
But I put it on someone else.
Never mind.

360
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:41,620
Gangu, pick up the luggage, quick,
and put it in the car.

361
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,570
Gangu, are you through?
Okay, please get in.

362
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,500
- After you.
- No way. Young men first.

363
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:53,880
- The two of you must sit together.
- It's okay, please sit.

364
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:57,880
- You are like my father.
- Of course, I am.

365
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,800
Get in, Mr. Arun.

366
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,080
Come on in.

367
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:20,040
Hello. I'm R.K Raju.
I'm Laxmi School's secretary.

368
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:25,046
I'm also a smalltime detective.
People say I'm lndia's number one.

369
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:31,360
Enough, windbag. He's my friend's son.
Been with us since he was a child.

370
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,820
Okay, Raju, see that their things
are placed properly in the bungalow.

371
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:42,150
Laxmi's mother, this is our
new graduate teacher couple.

372
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,930
They are just like our children.

373
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,950
She is like our daughter,
and he is like our son-in-law.

374
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:53,660
I have told them
how dear the school is to you.

375
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,150
Yes my child, the school
means life to me.

376
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,270
- Tell me something.
- Ask.

377
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:08,070
- What did your master do before?
- Sir, he commands respect.

378
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:12,890
He's a great man.
He owns half of Bombay.

379
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,290
Race Course, Boribunder,
High Court, Hanging Gardens...

380
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:20,640
- to name just a few.
- In that case, why is he here?

381
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,100
- That's the secret.
- Secret? There's a secret here.

382
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,730
- Let me hear it, feller.
- For such a big secret...

383
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:33,340
you have too small an ear.
Still, I can tell you.

384
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:37,120
- How?
- Let me have some dough first.

385
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,260
- Dough? What the hell is that?
- You don't understand? Cash.

386
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,570
- You got it.
- Here you are.

387
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,020
- That's more like it.
- Cash!

388
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,680
- You're at it again.
- Guru, a thief can stop stealing...

389
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,990
- but he can't stop swindling.
- Don't ever give him money.

390
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:04,080
- And never fall for his words.
- But he told me everything about you.

391
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:10,010
- Yes guru, everything.
I had almost finished.

392
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,130
I'll tell you the rest tomorrow.
Guru, the water is ready for your bath.

393
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,840
I wish to ask you something.
If you could spare five minutes...

394
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,970
Now look, the water is getting cold.
If you could spare five minutes...

395
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,720
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

396
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,390
- You are twenty, I guess?
- Right.

397
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,150
- Do you have parents?
- Yes.

398
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,780
Are you their real daughter?
Or did they borrow you from someone?

399
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:04,820
- What do you mean? Are you grilling me?
- Easy, lady.

400
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:09,800
It's in your own interest. Should you
turn out to be our missing Laxmi...

401
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:14,680
you'll inherit half Uncle Rai's property
and I'll be spared the trouble.

402
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,680
- What's going on? Is it a joke?
- There'll be a grand party then.

403
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:23,340
Amazing, mister. You're still here.
You don't remember what I told you?

404
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,180
I'm leaving, buddy.
Let's go, Chandragupta.

405
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:30,050
Chandragupta?
Great name for a comic-face.

406
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:02,240
We've fallen among strange people.
The old man is damn strict.

407
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,740
And his future son-in-law!
He's half-nuts.

408
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:09,520
- I don't know how we'll get along.
- There's only one solution.

409
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,730
Ignore whatever they say or do.

410
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,990
Well said. They'll keep on
treating me like a married woman.

411
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,430
- Do you expect me to sit and watch?
- We have no choice.

412
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:26,290
Come what may, we'll have to spend
these two months keeping our eyes shut.

413
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:30,270
As per Hindu custom, a married woman
must apply vermillion on her forehead.

414
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:33,320
If you don't, they'll be suspicious.

415
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,100
Anyway, what's the harm
in applying vermillion?

416
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,870
But how do I apply it?
I don't know these customs.

417
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,000
Not so hard.
If you try, you'll learn soon.

418
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,850
But you won't tell them anything
about me without consulting me.

419
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,740
And I won't tell them anything
about you without consulting you.

420
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,450
I promise. Go on, take some rest.
The journey was tiring, wasn't it?

421
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,470
- And be careful with one more thing.
- What is it?

422
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,000
The cross.

423
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,180
Narayan!

424
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:54,710
Why did you lock the door from outside?
Scared of kidnappers, eh?

425
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,580
- One must protect himself.
- Oh yes!

426
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,380
Welcome.

427
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:26,230
- Children, this is your new teacher.
- Greetings, sir.

428
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,740
Greetings. Be seated.

429
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:33,290
- Your classroom is over there.
- Greetings, ma'am.

430
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:36,020
- Greetings, ma'am.
- Greetings.

431
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,020
Take out your history books, students.
Let me see what has been taught so far.

432
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:45,410
There was no one to teach us, sir.

433
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:48,790
Two months since the summer vacations
ended, and no one taught you anything?

434
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,750
Had someone been teaching us,
you wouldn't be here, sir.

435
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,900
Naughty boys. All right, no problem.
I'll teach you.

436
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,800
In Emperor Akbar's court, one of his
advisors was the inimitable Birbal.

437
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:22,160
See Chandragupta? Laxmi's picture
perfectly matches the teacher's looks.

438
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,660
- No way.
- Chandragupta! You're myopic!

439
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,870
Look intently. Same eyes,
same nose...

440
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:34,240
- same looks, exact copy!
- Absolutely!

441
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,650
We must end this matter this very night.

442
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,840
- Greetings, sir.
- Greetings. Bless you.

443
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:59,060
- This is my daughter Sita.
- Greetings.

444
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:03,320
Look son, the two of you
will dine with us tonight.

445
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,010
And you'll have
to see me dance too.

446
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:24,760
- All right, we'll be there.
- Let's go, sister.

447
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:31,450
- I'll leave now.
- Where to? Won't you see the dance?

448
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:36,490
- It upsets my stomach. Bye.
- Bye.

449
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,500
Be seated.

450
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:45,510
What's this? Sit beside him.
Why must you shy away?

451
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:48,966
Make him a paan, dear

452
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:51,160
She hurt her finger.
I'll make it myself.

453
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:38,720
My love, come and embrace me

454
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:42,740
My heart is on fire...
I can't take it anymore

455
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:46,200
I can't hold on

456
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:27,780
What spell is this, my love?

457
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,490
Nothing amuses me at all

458
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,960
Those eyes have stolen
my very being

459
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:41,730
Come on the sly, near my window

460
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:46,420
I can't take it anymore

461
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,770
I can't hold on

462
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,710
Now that I've given
my heart to you...

463
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,400
you belong to me

464
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:48,850
Please pass through my street sometime

465
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:53,340
Without you, my love, I'll die

466
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:55,790
I'll die without you

467
00:52:56,330 --> 00:53:01,500
I can't take it anymore,
I can't hold on

468
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,100
My love, come and embrace me

469
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,720
My heart is on fire.
I can't take it anymore

470
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,740
I can't hold on

471
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:19,730
Amazing! Where did
Sita learn dancing?

472
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,400
At home. We hired a dance teacher.

473
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:27,040
- Sister, you haven't said a word yet.
- The dance was good.

474
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:29,460
But these types of songs
don't befit a modest girl.

475
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:35,290
You must teach her some good songs.
She can dance to any music.

476
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:37,410
My pleasure.
Send her over from tomorrow.

477
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:47,610
Amazing buddy.
You know English too.

478
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,040
No, I just guess the news
looking at the pictures.

479
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,650
Certainly. That's how
modern day studies are done.

480
00:53:55,270 --> 00:54:00,730
You haven't told me your name yet.
It should be a powerful name I suppose.

481
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,940
Mister, it is, absolutely.
My name makes the banks, mills...

482
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:13,300
and all businesses run. But why do you
need my name when I'm present myself?

483
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,170
For no reason.

484
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:19,980
- Buddy, is the lady from Bombay?
- You may say that.

485
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:24,890
Is she her parents' real daughter?
Or was she adopted?

486
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,600
Maybe she was borrowed.

487
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:32,620
Tell me this much. Does she
have a mole on her right leg?

488
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,010
Yes, sir. As big as a watermelon.

489
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,730
I'm talking about the lady,
not an elephant.

490
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,500
- Answer to the point.
- Well, if not a watermelon...

491
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,630
it should be almost
the size of an ant's tail.

492
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:51,870
You're quite smart and diplomatic.

493
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,820
Well, tell me,
when did your mother marry?

494
00:54:55,350 --> 00:55:00,680
Now look sir, you should be
asking my Father that.

495
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:03,960
You didn't get me.
I meant the lady.

496
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:09,500
I see. Sir, you have no right
to ask me about other's secrets.

497
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,490
Secret?
There's some secret to it?

498
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:16,960
- What's the secret?
- I'm not an ingrate.

499
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:22,000
- I can't betray my master for free.
- Not for free, buddy.

500
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:27,140
- Here you are.
- Now that's more like it.

501
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:34,300
Chandragupta, write. My master
and the lady were college mates.

502
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:38,040
Both used to cast glances
at each other, on the sly.

503
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:41,210
Their professor watched both of them,
and the students watched the professor.

504
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:44,160
The glances went from students to
professor, professor to students...

505
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,020
- master to lady, lady to master...
- Enough, enough!

506
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:49,770
- What happened?
- Cut the crap.

507
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:55,510
- Who saw whom first?
- Even they could never decide that.

508
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,700
They fight over it every day.
Wife says, "You did".

509
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:05,070
Husband says, "You did".

510
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:09,630
She says, you did, he says, you did,
she says, you did, he says, you did...

511
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:17,360
- You did!
- When did they marry?

512
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:22,460
Sir, the wedding episode
is longer than a movie story.

513
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:28,040
You've paid only for the trailer.
Have you seen the movie "The Succour"?

514
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,030
- Of course.
- Then don't be a scrooge...

515
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:33,760
- and give me some more dough.
- All right, buddy.

516
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,150
Here. Go on.

517
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:44,230
It was quite predictable.
At times when she didn't see him...

518
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:49,420
she went to his house,
and vice versa.

519
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:55,860
They went to the beaches, movies,
gardens and back home...

520
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:59,310
home to movies, gardens, movies,
and back home again.

521
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:02,730
Finally, they proved that
the world is round.

522
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:07,650
Awful. Just tell me,
how did they marry?

523
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:13,880
Strange. How am I to tell you in
three seconds what took three years?

524
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:17,050
Yes, if you could release
some more cash.

525
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:20,810
Take your mind off money
for a while.

526
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,480
My pocket's empty now.
I'll give you tomorrow.

527
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,890
Your pocket is empty
and my throat is sore.

528
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:33,180
- I'll tell you the rest tomorrow.
- You think I'm going to vanish?

529
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:37,280
- Take whatever you want tomorrow.
- You think I'm going to vanish?

530
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:41,700
Hear whatever you want tomorrow.
There goes the bell.

531
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:45,240
- You must leave now. Bye.
- Bye.

532
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:02,340
Today's our elder daughter's birthday.
My wife has invited your wife.

533
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,990
Mr. Rai, we have lots to do
at home tonight.

534
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:24,800
It can be done tomorrow.
You have no idea.

535
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:29,560
She reminds my wife
of our missing daughter Laxmi.

536
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,380
Please send her over.

537
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:47,110
- All right Mr. Rai, she'll be there.
- Please do. Bye.

538
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:56,730
Today is Laxmi's 20th birthday.
It's been 16 years since she went missing.

539
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,950
Only God knows where and how she is.

540
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,800
My child, please put on this sari.

541
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:09,460
It'll make me feel like
I'm watching my daughter Laxmi.

542
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:22,190
- I'm not so hungry. You may eat.
- No, you must eat.

543
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,940
As they say,
even God doesn't sleep hungry.

544
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:30,640
How true, guru. Humans, supersouls
and noble souls like me...

545
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:34,320
- everyone need to eat.
- He's a pious man.

546
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:39,100
- Are you enlightened too?
- Of course. We're strictly Hindus.

547
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:44,300
Our birth, our life and our death
are enlightened.

548
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:48,350
Forget the teachings.
Give her some vegetables.

549
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:51,770
- Lunch is great today.
- Looks good.

550
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:56,480
If Damayanti could cook like this,
King Nand would never have deserted her.

551
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:01,460
Lady, this dinner is
going to be memorable.

552
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,910
- Only chillies in it!
- Never mind, let it be.

553
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:21,000
- Try this.
- Give him.

554
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:35,070
- Cash, why did you add so much salt?
- I didn't, guru.

555
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:40,690
- Not my mistake.
- I read the book right to you.

556
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:46,200
Then it's the quantity to blame.
For two bucks saved, dinner's ruined.

557
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:49,450
So you folks weighed the spice
before adding them?

558
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:53,500
- Is there any vegetable left?
- Lots.

559
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,570
- I'll cook.
- Sure.

560
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:57,770
Well...

561
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:07,400
- Sir, where's sister?
- She's inside. Be comfortable.

562
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,120
- Would you have tea?
- No, thanks.

563
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,410
I just had bread and butter.

564
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:20,220
Sir, look at my necklace.
It's bought from Bombay? How's it?

565
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:22,610
- Very nice.
- And my earrings, sir?

566
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:25,240
- They're nice too.
- And my veil?

567
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:27,110
Take a look.

568
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:31,280
How'd I know? There she is.
Ask her.

569
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:37,380
- How do you find it, sister?
- Lovely. Get up now.

570
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:40,840
Why should I get up?
Doesn't this sofa belong to me?

571
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:45,710
Of course, it belongs to you.
The sofa, the house...

572
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,760
and we too belong to you.
Won't you get up now?

573
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:52,220
- No, no! I'm not getting up.
- C'mon, get up for the music lessons.

574
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:58,970
Did you see, sir? Sister hit me.
Ma never even touched me.

575
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,250
A teacher has more rights.
Go on, sit for the lessons.

576
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:31,330
These men are cruel and heartless.
Beware of them

577
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:36,430
Don't fall for their sweet talk

578
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:19,880
For all their silver tongues,
they are poor at heart

579
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:24,616
For what they show off,
they deliver so little

580
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:29,100
Big talk but nothing to show!
That's a die-hard habit

581
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:34,060
Don't ever fall
for their sweet talk

582
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:16,980
Heed my valuable advice.
I mean it

583
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:21,806
It's better to stay away from fire

584
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:26,440
They are sworn liars!
That's a die-hard habit

585
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:30,890
Don't ever fall
for their sweet talk

586
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:40,640
These men are cruel and heartless.
Beware of them

587
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:44,980
Don't fall for their sweet talk

588
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:00,380
Amazing! Very noble thought.
Great advice, wonderful lesson.

589
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:04,050
- You like it?
- Sure. A good thought must be shared.

590
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:07,930
- May I offer her some advice?
- My pleasure.

591
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:45,220
Keep pace with the world.
Times have changed

592
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:49,830
Blaming it on men
is a dated tune

593
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:54,670
Call us born liars,
or call us obsessed...

594
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:59,250
but it is men to whom
the world is enslaved

595
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:07,160
Men are cruel and heartless,
I agree

596
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:11,410
Still, it is men to whom
the world is enslaved

597
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:55,010
Anger, vanity and aggressiveness
are women's mistakes

598
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:59,730
Keep a cool head!
That's the first rule to follow

599
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:04,570
You may call me a madman
but this much I say is true

600
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:09,030
It is men to whom
the world is enslaved

601
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:16,690
Men are cruel and heartless,
I agree

602
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,970
Still, it is men to whom
the world is enslaved

603
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:35,320
Sir, you are just amazing.

604
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:38,360
- What do you say?
- I didn't like it at all.

605
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:43,160
- Sir, I loved it.
- Why don't you learn music from him?

606
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:44,630
Sure.

607
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:49,680
Goodness! I almost forgot. Ma has
invited both of you over for lunch.

608
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:54,560
- Impossible. We have to go to school.
- School? But today is Sunday.

609
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:58,000
- We don't feel hungry on Sundays.
- I don't know.

610
01:07:58,430 --> 01:07:59,930
I have conveyed Ma's message.

611
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:04,010
Whether you go or you stay home,
the choice is yours. I'm off.

612
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,510
He's an important man.
What's the harm in accepting?

613
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,180
What harm? You wouldn't know that.
Last night they were getting too close.

614
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:16,690
They assume you're their
son-in-law and I'm their daughter.

615
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:19,820
- Someone is certainly inciting them.
- You mean I'm at it?

616
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:23,149
Who else can it be?
The fake wedding was your idea.

617
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:26,170
If you hadn't cooked up this idea,
I wouldn't be in this terrible mess.

618
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:28,719
After all, who are they to me?
What do I mean to them?

619
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,600
You think I have crazy ideas?
Look, I'm not that type.

620
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:34,960
No matter what, you have to spend
these two months here.

621
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:36,910
Then you can leave after you're paid.

622
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:40,300
- As for me, let's see what fate brings.
- I don't care.

623
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:43,080
But I'm not going there for lunch!

624
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,510
You've come alone?
Where's our daughter?

625
01:08:54,649 --> 01:09:00,869
- She's not well.
- How could you leave her alone then?

626
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,980
You're strange. Don't you
care for your wife?

627
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:09,320
Mr. Rai, you were expecting us,
so I thought I'd go and inform you.

628
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:14,580
- All right, go on. I'll get a doctor.
- No Mr. Rai, it's nothing serious.

629
01:09:14,689 --> 01:09:17,149
- Go on, I say.
- Listen to me, Mr. Rai...

630
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,209
Go on! Strange man.

631
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:27,810
- Sorry madam, I've made a mistake.
- Of course, what else can you do?

632
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:33,260
- Nothing new. What is it this time?
- You refused to go for lunch.

633
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:37,860
But I went, and he asked me about you.
I don't know what hell drove me...

634
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:40,680
to say that you're ill.
No sooner did I say that...

635
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:46,419
Mr. Rai began raging at me,
"Why did you leave her alone?"

636
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:50,230
"Don't you care for your wife?
Go home, I'll get a doctor."

637
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:55,410
Well madam, the doctor is on his way.
Please manage it, else I'm dead.

638
01:09:55,630 --> 01:10:00,230
I see. So for your own sake now,
you want me to play sick.

639
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:04,700
If not for me, for my job's sake.
I'll be obliged.

640
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:09,450
Why don't you suggest me a disease too?
Tuberculosis, pneumonia, rheumatism, lunacy?

641
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:12,310
- What would you suggest?
- Whatever you like.

642
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:16,010
- I mean, I didn't name any sickness.
- Arun...

643
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:18,940
They're here. Lie down! Please!

644
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:24,410
Come, doctor.

645
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,520
What happened to you, my child?

646
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,690
What is it, child?
Doctor, examine her.

647
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:46,530
Never mind. So what if she
doesn't tell me anything?

648
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:51,470
I have treated several mutes.
She's caught a cold in the brain.

649
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:57,300
Such patients lie senseless.
But there's nothing to worry about.

650
01:10:57,510 --> 01:11:01,470
I'll give her a pill
that will cure her in a trice.

651
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:05,460
It's your brain that has gone cold.
I'm perfectly normal. Go away.

652
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:08,940
She's also suffering from acidity.

653
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:13,180
But the acidity is less important
than the cold in the brain.

654
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:16,800
I'll give three pills for cold
and one for acidity.

655
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,360
Mix them in honey and give to her.

656
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:22,230
Why honey? Mix them in poison
and have it yourself.

657
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:27,590
Goodness! I was wrong. The acidity
is worse than the cold in the brain.

658
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:32,330
Never mind. I'll give three pills
for acidity and one for the cold.

659
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:37,780
You take them! You are the one
who is ill, not I. Get out of here.

660
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:48,420
Oh! Now I understand! She's not ill
at all! She's possessed.

661
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,530
You're the one who's possessed!
I'll exorcise you right now!

662
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:56,916
She's not possessed! Go away. You
come up with three ailments at a time.

663
01:11:56,940 --> 01:12:01,260
Am I wrong? The diagnosis were
according to the patient's conditions.

664
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:09,090
It's over now. Just shut your eyes
for awhile and they'll go away.

665
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,830
You told me to turn a deaf ear, I did.
Now you tell me to shut my eyes.

666
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:14,350
I can't carry on.

667
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:25,080
Scram, evil spirit! Devil's
messenger, scoot! Else, I'll hit you.

668
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:30,520
You hear that? Send them all away.
Else I'll expose you right now.

669
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:45,030
Stop it.
Mantras in Sankrit are no good.

670
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:48,850
This evil spirit is not a Hindu,
it's a Christian spirit.

671
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:18,380
- Get up, come and eat something.
- I'm not hungry. You go and eat.

672
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:22,460
Not hungry? You didn't have
lunch either. Who are you angry with?

673
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:26,580
- No one. Go away.
- Had I known you were such a hothead...

674
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:29,970
- I'd never have brought you here.
- Had I known you are such a fraud...

675
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:32,301
- I'd never have come here with you.
- So I'm a fraud, eh?

676
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:35,440
- Am I hothead then?
- All right! No good arguing with you.

677
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:38,130
I'm a fraud, okay?
Cash, you can have your dinner.

678
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:53,210
- Who are you angry with now?
- I dare not be angry with anyone.

679
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:57,830
- I'm angry with myself.
- You dare to take on women?

680
01:13:58,030 --> 01:13:59,430
Come and have dinner.

681
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:08,990
Give him.

682
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:10,960
Give her.

683
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:12,980
Him.

684
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:15,030
Her.

685
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:21,070
Hey Cash.

686
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:27,240
You may sit.

687
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:15,560
Sita!

688
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,610
- Are you here for the music lessons?
- Yes sir.

689
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:23,170
- Go to your sister.
- Sister? Goodness!

690
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:26,870
- I'd rather you teach me, sir.
- I have some work outside.

691
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:30,616
- No. You must teach me.
- Don't insist.

692
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:34,530
- I have important work, I said.
- No, sir. I'll learn only from you.

693
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,990
- Listen to me, Sita...
- What's going on?

694
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:41,480
When he said he has urgent work,
why do you bother him? I'll teach you.

695
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:49,740
You're staring at me
as if I'm some evil spirit.

696
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:53,980
- Sir, I'm scared.
- Why are you scared?

697
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:56,010
I'm not going to eat you.
Come with me.

698
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,750
Let her be. She's scared.

699
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:06,370
- You'd better go home, Sita.
- No, I'm scared.

700
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:08,980
- Drop me at home, sir.
- All right.

701
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:12,410
I'll drop her and go to school.
Meet me there.

702
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:14,710
Come, Sita.

703
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:27,720
Cash!

704
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:35,290
Give this note to your guru.

705
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:04,020
- Is she really furious?
- Guru, she's really hot.

706
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,710
Then tonight there's surely
going to be a fight.

707
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,660
Cash, somehow she must eat
and go to bed before I reach home.

708
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,970
I'll take the back door in.
Leave it open.

709
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:47,330
How long will you wait, madam?
It's nine, you must eat now.

710
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:51,090
- Tell me honestly, what did he say?
- He said nothing.

711
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:55,610
But it was obvious from his face that
he wasn't going to come home tonight.

712
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:58,060
Then where will he eat
and where will he sleep?

713
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:02,700
Frankly speaking,
guru is scared of you.

714
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:07,310
As for tonight, he'll eat at Mr. Rai's
place and sleep under some tree.

715
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:10,570
I don't care! I'm not going
to wait on him.

716
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:18,250
- What's that noise?
- A bull, maybe.

717
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:22,230
- Bull? In the kitchen? Let me see!
- Must be cooking something.

718
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,460
Could be a mouse.

719
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:33,040
Well! So you're playing hide-n-seek
at this hour of the night?

720
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:37,020
We're already in trouble. And now
you want to kick up another fuss?

721
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:40,806
- I ask you, what are you really up to?
- Nothing. You were furious...

722
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:43,126
I'm furious? You've been doing things
according to your whims and fancies.

723
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:45,460
I know you want to strike
a cordial cord with those folks.

724
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:48,130
Do it, but don't drag me into it.
You get that?

725
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:56,710
- Did you see that?
- I saw it, I heard it too.

726
01:18:57,450 --> 01:19:02,310
But why are you scared, guru? "lt is
men to whom the world is enslaved"

727
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:05,110
Hush! What if he she hears?

728
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,550
Thief! Thief!

729
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:03,600
He flashed a flashlight through
the window. I woke up, and he ran.

730
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:14,260
He vanished. Go on, go to bed.
Nothing to worry about now.

731
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:17,630
- I'm scared.
- What for? Cash will keep watch.

732
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:19,650
Besides, I'll be
in the living room. Come on.

733
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:23,880
- Cash, stay alert.
- Rest assured.

734
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,360
Oh! It was the door.

735
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:22,530
- You stayed up all night?
- So what? You slept well, didn't you?

736
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:26,910
Yes, I slept tight.
I had a strange dream too.

737
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:31,350
- What was the dream? Tell me.
- Just nothing

738
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,960
There's something.
Did you dream of John?

739
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:37,990
- How did you guess?
- No big deal.

740
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:41,480
You can dream of
either John, or me.

741
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:47,100
Please sit.

742
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:55,470
Actually, if those folks stop
taking us for a married couple...

743
01:25:56,060 --> 01:26:00,470
- I won't even think of quitting.
- Great news. You must stay back.

744
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:03,600
This is heaven for bachelors.
You have nothing to fear.

745
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:06,470
You mean you're going
to remain a bachelor for life?

746
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:10,540
Who knows? I'd like
to ask you something.

747
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:16,340
We aren't man and wife. So why do you
mind when they take us for one?

748
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:19,970
Wouldn't I mind?
Only a woman can understand it.

749
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:26,440
Forget it. You must be tired. Go and
freshen up while I make you some tea.

750
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:36,080
The school has improved so much in the
last one month, I just can't imagine.

751
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:39,360
Honestly child, you have given
the school a new look.

752
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:46,290
If you keep up the good work, I'm sure
ours will become a high school someday.

753
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:50,770
- Why not? It will be, soon.
- Yes, Mr. Rai, don't you worry.

754
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:54,000
- We'll do everything we can.
- No.

755
01:26:54,520 --> 01:27:00,500
I'll give your salary to your wife.
I know you're going to blow it up.

756
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,580
As you wish.
It doesn't make any difference.

757
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:13,550
See? He left quietly.
You must have a hold on him.

758
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:17,180
These boys are very careless.
The other day when you were unwell...

759
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:19,770
he left you alone at home
and came over.

760
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:23,030
He was supposed to tend to you.
This is not how a family works.

761
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:28,590
- You must always keep a watch on him.
- We all need to keep an eye on him

762
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,370
- I should be leaving.
- All right.

763
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:42,200
You got away, but I was trapped.

764
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,360
The moment you left,
he started giving me advice.

765
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,130
He said, I should have
complete hold over you.

766
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:52,930
So many things he kept saying.

767
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:56,630
- Here's your salary.
- I'm not in much need of it right now.

768
01:27:57,190 --> 01:28:01,390
You can repay John with it. In case
I need it, I'll take it next month.

769
01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:04,180
- You don't have to send it to anyone?
- No one.

770
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:06,730
- To some relative?
- None.

771
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:12,690
Then please send the money
to my Father by money order.

772
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:23,720
The merciful Jesus Christ
has been so kind to us...

773
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:27,860
that today I'm able
to repay you to the last penny.

774
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,160
Take your 400 bucks
and return my promissory note.

775
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:36,050
My God! 400 bucks within one month?
Where did she find it?

776
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:40,970
- Has she hit a jackpot?
- No. A noble man lent it to her.

777
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:46,470
- Give me back my promissory note.
- I'm giving it. Here you are.

778
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:52,290
Well, could you tell me
where Mary is?

779
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:56,690
I've told you! I won't tell you her
whereabouts. Why do you keep asking?

780
01:28:57,490 --> 01:28:58,990
- You won't tell me?
- No.

781
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:00,750
- Sure?
- Sure.

782
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:02,420
Goodbye!

783
01:29:13,150 --> 01:29:16,770
The acknowledgement receipt is here.
Thank God I'm off John's debt.

784
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:21,850
- Thank you and your lovely suggestion.
- I ought to thank you.

785
01:29:22,450 --> 01:29:25,450
Had you turned down my suggestion,
things would've been different today.

786
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:31,760
Whatever. I must commend your ideas.
One ought to learn diplomacy from you.

787
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:34,150
Sir...

788
01:29:35,890 --> 01:29:38,640
- What brings you here, Sita?
- I'm not here for you.

789
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:42,490
- I have some work with my teacher.
- What work do you have with him?

790
01:29:43,070 --> 01:29:46,670
- Music lessons. What else?
- No more music lessons. Go away.

791
01:29:48,490 --> 01:29:52,630
Who are you to throw me out? I'll tell
my father and get you dismissed.

792
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:56,490
As if you own this house!
You can do what you want. Get out.

793
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:01,930
Just watch what I do!
Sir, come, give me lessons at home.

794
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:05,100
- Sita, listen to me.
- Please, sir.

795
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:07,990
- Come on, sir.
- I'll come over tomorrow.

796
01:30:08,050 --> 01:30:12,420
- No, now.
- Not anymore! Never! Go away.

797
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:14,240
- Come on, sir.
- No way!

798
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:15,530
- Sir...
- No!

799
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:18,280
- Sir!
- Never! He won't ever go with you!

800
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:20,750
Why not? I'll take him away
from right under your nose.

801
01:30:20,990 --> 01:30:25,570
He will come and give him lessons
at home, else I'll cut my ear off.

802
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:28,580
I give a damn! Cut that nose off too!
Bloody savage!

803
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:35,050
You are a savage! Look at you!
Always bitter and sour! Ugly woman!

804
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:51,170
Wonderful! Guru, Rukhmini
and Satyabama are born again.

805
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:54,800
- What is he talking about?
- The Scriptures.

806
01:30:55,350 --> 01:31:00,290
Rukhmini and Satyabama were sisters.
They used to brawl day and night.

807
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:05,800
I see. Cash, we're going out.
Look after the house.

808
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:07,630
- My pleasure.
- Let's go.

809
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:16,110
Aunt...

810
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:24,100
Aunt, one more, just one.

811
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:29,960
You take money from me daily, but have
you found out anything about Laxmi?

812
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:35,130
I'm trying day and night, aunt.
Her picture is a bit old-fashioned.

813
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:41,270
Girls have turned modern.
They don't wear lockets anymore.

814
01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:46,560
As for the mole, girls these days
have gone one step ahead of boys...

815
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:50,420
wearing high heels and big sandals.

816
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:54,800
Forget the mole, not even their legs
can be seen. But you needn't worry.

817
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:59,110
This R.K Raju, lndia's number one
detective, will certainly trace her.

818
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:09,090
Ma, the lady is a real witch.
She won't let sir teach me music.

819
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:14,910
- Raju, dismiss her at once.
- You mustn't say that, dear.

820
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:19,520
- If she leaves, he'll go away too.
- Then call him here.

821
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:23,710
- Let him teach me at home.
- All right, I'll call him here.

822
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:27,570
Raju, go and tell Arun
that I've sent for him. Go on.

823
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:30,080
- But aunt...
- Go on, will you?

824
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:31,770
Going.

825
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,190
Hey buddy.

826
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:41,670
- Hello there.
- Where's your master?

827
01:32:42,150 --> 01:32:45,780
- What's the matter?
- Nothing special. Sita wants him.

828
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:50,420
Wants him?
Then guru's fate is sealed.

829
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:53,580
- What happened?
- Don't ask me. Poor guru!

830
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:56,890
What's wrong with your guru?
He was just fine.

831
01:32:57,030 --> 01:33:03,710
What do I say, sir? It's like this.
How about some dough?

832
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:08,160
Same old tune.
Dough, dough, dough!

833
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:12,990
- Here you are.
- That's more like it.

834
01:33:13,650 --> 01:33:18,260
Actually, Sita wants my guru
to go over and teach her music.

835
01:33:18,450 --> 01:33:22,980
And the lady doesn't like that.
If guru doesn't teach her music...

836
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:26,890
Sita is upset. If he teaches her,
the lady gets upset.

837
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:30,630
I tell you, my guru is really
in deep water.

838
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:34,970
He's stuck between
a rock and a hard place.

839
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:40,870
If Sita wants to learn music from him,
why does the lady object?

840
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:46,820
That's the secret. I could
reveal it to you for a few bucks.

841
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:48,090
- Really?
- Yes.

842
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:51,170
- Take.
- Good.

843
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:55,970
- Now tell me.
- Last time when the lady fell ill...

844
01:33:56,030 --> 01:34:01,480
she threatened to quit the job.
Remember what Mr. Rai said then?

845
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:05,090
- What did he say?
- "Is she trying to threaten me?"

846
01:34:05,290 --> 01:34:09,120
"She can go if she wants to.
I'll get Sita married to Arun."

847
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:15,860
Know what? Desire is universal.
Guru was tempted at the mention of Sita.

848
01:34:16,090 --> 01:34:21,490
- What? Is he so desirous?
- Yes, desirous of money, like everyone.

849
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:25,840
Sita is the daughter
of a millionaire.

850
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:29,846
Now open your heart and release
some more dough to hear more.

851
01:34:29,870 --> 01:34:32,670
Enough. I've heard enough.
Chandragupta...

852
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:35,530
- Yes sire?
- Sire, my foot! Let's go home.

853
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:45,480
- Raju, you didn't bring him along?
- He refused to come. Bloody prince!

854
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:49,860
You needn't worry, Sita.
I'll dismiss him right away!

855
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:55,100
Ma, he's going
to dismiss the teacher.

856
01:34:55,510 --> 01:34:59,040
Raju, don't make haste.
Mind your own business.

857
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:00,600
Go!

858
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:07,060
Don't worry, dear. I'll tell
your father to call Arun over.

859
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:35,440
The moon and the stars...

860
01:35:35,790 --> 01:35:38,870
each one of them...

861
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:42,240
I shall lay...

862
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:45,150
at your feet someday

863
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:50,440
Wonderful!
You will even fetch the sun.

864
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:56,730
Big talk. Have you even got her
a silver ring yet?

865
01:35:57,160 --> 01:36:00,170
My child, don't fall
for his sweet talk.

866
01:36:00,430 --> 01:36:05,650
You've stopped coming over, dear,
and you've forbidden Arun too.

867
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:08,040
You think we're going
to snatch Arun from you?

868
01:36:08,350 --> 01:36:10,540
Nothing of that sort.
We'll certainly come.

869
01:36:10,650 --> 01:36:15,140
I told you so many times, yet you
never came to teach Sita music, Arun.

870
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:19,210
- You know, she is really very upset.
- Mr. Rai, lately I've been unwell.

871
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:21,590
- I'll definitely come tomorrow.
- No way. Now.

872
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:24,840
The two of you must come right away.
Let's go, my child.

873
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:28,260
I have to cook. You may go.

874
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:37,396
- They're discussing.
- Not everyone is like you.

875
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:39,990
Right. What did you say?

876
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:58,690
You think you understand
what they're discussing?

877
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:04,400
She's saying our faces aren't
worth watching. It's true, isn't it?

878
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:07,120
Arun, now come on.

879
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:08,720
Coming.

880
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:16,500
Sir, Cash says that the lady is
a hundred times better than you.

881
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:19,100
I know, he always takes her side.

882
01:37:19,330 --> 01:37:21,360
Cash, go home. She's alone.

883
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,480
Come on in, sir.

884
01:37:34,530 --> 01:37:36,980
- Hello.
- Hello. Please be seated.

885
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:40,130
- Cash, make some tea.
- No, thanks.

886
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:42,760
- I have to ask you something important.
- Tell me.

887
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:45,480
Cash, go on.

888
01:37:46,730 --> 01:37:48,390
Come, sit.

889
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:53,080
- What is it?
- You must be aware...

890
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,450
- of what's going on here.
- Yes.

891
01:37:56,150 --> 01:37:59,010
And yet you are betraying
your emotions.

892
01:38:00,010 --> 01:38:03,420
- The matter has gone from bad to worse.
- I can't help it.

893
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:05,540
Keep your fiancée under control.

894
01:38:05,630 --> 01:38:10,670
Regretfully, nothing's under my control.
You can help me if you wish.

895
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:14,080
If it's in my hands, I will.
What do you want me to do?

896
01:38:14,570 --> 01:38:19,070
Nothing much. Why don't you
teach Sita music?

897
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:23,010
She doesn't want to learn from me,
that's she picked him.

898
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:28,530
- I agree. But we must find a way out.
- Why don't you teach her?

899
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:33,460
- Me? I don't know music.
- But you can learn it.

900
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:36,000
You can learn from me here,
and then you can teach Sita.

901
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:41,130
- No, no. I'm shy.
- What for? Let's begin now.

902
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:44,850
- Please, spare my throat.
- Don't worry, it's only music.

903
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:49,330
- Not a Herculean task at all.
- Listen please, my throat!

904
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:54,120
- Listen to me, please.
- Not to worry.

905
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,800
Once more.

906
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:36,880
I can't get it right.
I'm not good, am I?

907
01:39:37,110 --> 01:39:41,030
Too good. At this rate,
you are going to make it big soon.

908
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:42,620
Really? Once more.

909
01:39:52,210 --> 01:39:56,560
- It's difficult.
- Obviously. Nothing comes on a platter.

910
01:39:56,730 --> 01:39:59,370
If you continue, you'll catch
the tune. So keep screaming.

911
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:01,860
Who asked for your opinion?
Mind your own business.

912
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:06,450
Sing like I do.

913
01:40:11,110 --> 01:40:13,900
Forget the notes
and teach me a song.

914
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:15,580
Sure.

915
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:19,660
You are happy there
and I'm happy here

916
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:27,290
Then what are we squabbling over?

917
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:35,070
What are you scared of?
Look here.

918
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:37,740
Sing.

919
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:46,020
He's watching me.

920
01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:49,040
- Why are you looking here?
- Is watching a crime?

921
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:52,760
Cash, stand here.
Block his view.

922
01:40:54,690 --> 01:40:55,790
Sing.

923
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:00,960
Sing.

924
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:20,680
- Why are you so scared? Come with me.
- Leave my hand, please.

925
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,100
- Come on.
- Listen...

926
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:24,140
Don't worry, sit here.

927
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:30,320
Sit down. What difference does
it make? We aren't village oafs.

928
01:41:31,310 --> 01:41:34,510
It's okay, I'm not used to it.
I'd rather leave.

929
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:36,860
Listen...

930
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:40,840
You must surely come tomorrow.
I'll teach you a new song.

931
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:44,970
- No, I can't come here.
- No problem, I'll come over.

932
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:47,780
Not there, not here.

933
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,290
- Why are you jealous?
- I?

934
01:41:52,590 --> 01:41:53,690
Yes

935
01:41:59,370 --> 01:42:03,370
Master, come on, don't lose heart.
Try again.

936
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:08,120
I've tried a hundred times.
I tried the harmonium...

937
01:42:08,650 --> 01:42:11,120
I tried the tabla,
I tried this...

938
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:13,810
and I tried that,
but unfortunately...

939
01:42:14,590 --> 01:42:18,280
I could neither sing
nor I could play any instrument

940
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:22,770
I failed to impress my sweetheart

941
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:40,780
There's...

942
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:42,850
Sa

943
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,300
There's...

944
01:42:45,370 --> 01:42:46,470
Re

945
01:42:46,710 --> 01:42:52,000
There're five more notes

946
01:42:54,770 --> 01:42:58,590
The higher notes...

947
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:03,850
and lower notes are so misplaced

948
01:43:05,010 --> 01:43:09,610
The burden of seven notes...

949
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:13,650
is a heavy one on my shoulders

950
01:43:23,110 --> 01:43:27,670
I couldn't even get
one note right

951
01:43:28,010 --> 01:43:31,860
I failed to impress my sweetheart

952
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:43,670
I could neither sing
nor I could play any instrument

953
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:47,530
I failed to impress my sweetheart

954
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:49,110
Damn

955
01:43:50,370 --> 01:43:53,300
The pitch is your own

956
01:43:56,190 --> 01:43:57,286
So...

957
01:43:57,310 --> 01:43:59,490
swirl...

958
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:03,490
warm up your throat...

959
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:11,620
and get into a jig

960
01:44:30,410 --> 01:44:32,530
Oh my Sita, my dearest...

961
01:44:32,610 --> 01:44:35,060
you are the only one

962
01:44:36,990 --> 01:44:42,530
My love, my sweetheart, my honey

963
01:44:54,730 --> 01:44:57,000
How I wish I'd fly to London...

964
01:44:59,190 --> 01:45:01,330
and learn the violin

965
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:27,940
But sadly...

966
01:45:28,770 --> 01:45:30,610
regretfully...

967
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:32,930
pity me

968
01:45:37,290 --> 01:45:40,530
Unfortunately, my love...

969
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:42,560
I regret...

970
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:45,370
I don't know how to
use a fork and spoon

971
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:49,730
And I failed to impress my beloved

972
01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:54,090
I could neither sing
nor I could play any instrument

973
01:45:54,170 --> 01:45:56,260
I could neither do this nor that

974
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:40,400
- For how long have you been here?
- I just arrived.

975
01:46:41,430 --> 01:46:43,610
- Please come in.
- It's all right.

976
01:46:44,350 --> 01:46:46,890
- Sita forbid me from entering your room.
- I see.

977
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:51,830
- So Sita's been squealing?
- Yes, Sita told everything about you.

978
01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:53,890
She's come for you.

979
01:46:55,430 --> 01:46:58,660
Where are you going?
I'll teach you music. Come on.

980
01:46:59,420 --> 01:47:00,620
Come on.

981
01:47:03,630 --> 01:47:04,930
Come on, learn.

982
01:47:08,210 --> 01:47:11,590
Not now. I'll be there
when he finishes. You stay here.

983
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:36,490
Krishna, the apple
of everyone's eye in Vrindavan

984
01:47:44,420 --> 01:47:52,400
He endeared himself so much that
even His beloved Radha envied Him

985
01:48:34,370 --> 01:48:42,030
Every time He entertained
at the banks of the river Jamuna...

986
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:49,630
His melodious flute...

987
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:53,686
entranced the women in Vrindavan

988
01:48:53,710 --> 01:48:57,440
I wonder what spell He cast

989
01:48:57,490 --> 01:49:04,900
Krishna, the apple
of everyone's eye in Vrindavan

990
01:49:31,660 --> 01:49:39,470
His complexion, like the
enchanting dark monsoon clouds

991
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:47,020
He is a magician.
He has driven me crazy

992
01:49:47,330 --> 01:49:54,760
For Him, I have put
the world behind me

993
01:49:54,790 --> 01:50:02,200
Krishna, the apple
of everyone's eye in Vrindavan

994
01:50:02,330 --> 01:50:09,940
He endeared himself so much that
even His beloved Radha envied Him

995
01:50:29,250 --> 01:50:30,450
Come here.

996
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,820
- What's going on?
- What?

997
01:50:34,910 --> 01:50:36,910
She wants to go back home.
She's applied for leave.

998
01:50:37,370 --> 01:50:40,840
- Leave? I don't know anything about it.
- And how would you know?

999
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:45,470
The two of you have changed.
I've been watching you.

1000
01:50:46,190 --> 01:50:50,546
Go and placate her. If she leaves,
you'll see the worst of me.

1001
01:50:50,570 --> 01:50:52,440
- Go on.
- I'll try reasoning with her.

1002
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:57,890
They've had a tiff I guess.
We must not interfere.

1003
01:50:58,180 --> 01:51:01,260
If the matter worsens,
we'll lose them.

1004
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:05,726
They're just kids. Besides, they
don't have anyone to advise them.

1005
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:10,430
Don't you worry.
We'll go over after dinner.

1006
01:51:16,710 --> 01:51:17,810
Well...

1007
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:33,120
You see...

1008
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:45,460
- Actually...
- What is it? Why don't you talk?

1009
01:51:45,860 --> 01:51:49,100
- I will, but I'm scared of you.
- You don't need to be.

1010
01:51:49,310 --> 01:51:53,070
I'm leaving the day after tomorrow. Then
you'll be free to do anything you want.

1011
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:58,450
- Nothing of that sort. Think again.
- No chance, I've thought enough.

1012
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:05,340
How selfish. You don't care about me.
Just think, if you were to leave...

1013
01:52:05,590 --> 01:52:08,050
and you never return,
what will I tell them?

1014
01:52:08,490 --> 01:52:12,460
Anything that comes to mind.
You got a silver tongue anyway.

1015
01:52:12,770 --> 01:52:17,580
- You'll find an answer.
- Sure, but I don't have the heart.

1016
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:22,000
- What answer do you have anyway?
- Forget it. You'll just take it wrong.

1017
01:52:22,370 --> 01:52:24,600
No, I won't. Tell me.

1018
01:52:25,170 --> 01:52:28,530
I'll tell them that you've suffered
from typhoid back home.

1019
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:31,160
And I'll deliberately starve
for a couple of days.

1020
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:34,500
Then Mr. and Mrs. Rai
will say to me...

1021
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:41,290
"Son, be brave. She'll be all right.
Why don't you go and look her up."

1022
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:46,140
And I'll say, "No Mr. Rai. I have got
the school to take care of."

1023
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:49,550
"I'd rather send Cash". That will
see me through for a few days."

1024
01:52:50,190 --> 01:52:53,110
- Then what?
- Simple.

1025
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:57,920
If you return, good. Else, I'll have
Cash send me a telegram.

1026
01:52:58,530 --> 01:53:02,320
Clutching the telegram,
a few tears dropping from my eyes...

1027
01:53:02,530 --> 01:53:04,860
and with a deep sigh
I will say...

1028
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:09,830
"Mr. Rai, I should have
listened to you the other day."

1029
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:14,040
"It's too late now. She has gone
too far away for my eyes to see."

1030
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:17,930
- You'll tell them I'm dead?
- I can't say you've eloped, can I?

1031
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:22,680
Then you tell me what I'm supposed
to do. I still have to feed myself.

1032
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:26,850
Now don't fool me with an alibi!
I know very well what you're up to.

1033
01:53:27,060 --> 01:53:30,210
After you've told them I'm dead,
they'll marry you to Sita.

1034
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:34,550
But I don't care. Marry her and
enjoy yourself. I'm not staying here!

1035
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:39,060
Look, if you accuse me,
I will not let you step outside.

1036
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:41,810
- Who are you to stop me? I'm leaving!
- No way!

1037
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:43,640
- I will!
- I won't allow you.

1038
01:53:43,670 --> 01:53:46,400
- What right do you have? I will go!
- You can't.

1039
01:53:46,470 --> 01:53:49,400
- I will, I will!
- You can't, you can't!

1040
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:54,610
- Arun, have patience.
- To hell with patience, Mr. Rai!

1041
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:57,890
Look at her. It's hardly two months,
and she wants to go back.

1042
01:53:58,210 --> 01:54:00,690
- Isn't she being silly?
- You stopped me here...

1043
01:54:00,750 --> 01:54:04,300
- or I'd have left the very first month.
- This is news!

1044
01:54:06,910 --> 01:54:11,120
Know what?
She's two months pregnant.

1045
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:23,810
You mustn't weep, dear.
I'll make Arun see reason.

1046
01:54:24,390 --> 01:54:28,200
If you want, you can go home
for a month. But don't weep.

1047
01:54:28,630 --> 01:54:30,750
Am I weeping? Just go away.

1048
01:54:37,630 --> 01:54:40,980
You're acting like a child.
You mustn't hurt a woman.

1049
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,750
At such times, every woman
would long to go to her mother.

1050
01:54:44,430 --> 01:54:48,650
- Send her home for a month or so.
- Send her if you want.

1051
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:52,010
- But I don't agree with this.
- Stop being stubborn. Go on.

1052
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:56,980
- Enough Mr. Rai. I've had enough.
- You've crossed the line, too.

1053
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:03,180
Mr Rai! This is doing no good.
Open the door.

1054
01:55:04,090 --> 01:55:07,520
Cash, I warn you against
opening the door.

1055
01:55:20,350 --> 01:55:21,650
Lock the door.

1056
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:05,590
Traveller of the nights,
oh Moon...

1057
01:56:05,970 --> 01:56:09,140
tell me if I'm in the wrong

1058
01:56:09,330 --> 01:56:12,390
It's for you to decide

1059
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:43,980
Have I been amorous?
Or have my eyes intruded?

1060
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:47,510
If I'm not in the wrong...

1061
01:56:47,790 --> 01:56:51,050
why is someone so angry?

1062
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:57,990
I shall take it in my stride...

1063
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:01,490
any punishment you decree

1064
01:57:01,810 --> 01:57:05,110
Tell me if I'm in the wrong

1065
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:08,530
It's for you to decide

1066
01:57:08,810 --> 01:57:15,500
Traveller of the nights,
oh Moon...

1067
01:57:15,830 --> 01:57:19,290
tell me if I have erred

1068
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:22,390
It is for you to decide

1069
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:57,780
Someone fails to hold back
his feelings

1070
01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:55,760
Someone's boat has lost its way.
Lead her ashore

1071
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:59,270
Am I in the wrong?

1072
01:58:59,550 --> 01:59:02,580
It is for you to decide

1073
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:09,780
Traveller of the nights,
oh Moon...

1074
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,430
tell me if I'm in the wrong

1075
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:17,290
It's for you to decide

1076
01:59:48,180 --> 01:59:50,920
- Arun...
- Welcome.

1077
01:59:51,860 --> 01:59:55,000
Tonight we're having a ritual for
your wife. Come over for dinner.

1078
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:58,750
- What is the ritual?
- Don't act so innocent.

1079
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:03,300
- You're going to be a father.
- Oh, I see.

1080
02:00:03,690 --> 02:00:07,340
But it's a dated practice.
Who cares for such rituals anymore?

1081
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:10,520
Ask the women.
You mustn't interfere.

1082
02:00:12,630 --> 02:00:16,210
Fine, if she's willing, take her
along. Don't you blame me later.

1083
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:17,900
Why would I blame you?

1084
02:00:22,420 --> 02:00:25,480
My child, tonight we're having
a ritual for you.

1085
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:29,790
- Come over by five.
- What does he say?

1086
02:00:30,130 --> 02:00:33,400
What can the poor chap say?
He says it's your prerogative.

1087
02:00:34,220 --> 02:00:37,570
- All right, I'll be there.
- Bring Arun along.

1088
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:44,080
Bye son.

1089
02:00:49,220 --> 02:00:50,820
What the hell is a ritual?

1090
02:00:52,630 --> 02:00:56,550
Actually, a ritual is a festival
that women celebrate.

1091
02:00:57,110 --> 02:01:01,030
It's a kind of birthday party
on a higher scale.

1092
02:01:01,650 --> 02:01:07,350
Beats me. But I've promised her.
I'll take it in my stride.

1093
02:01:11,540 --> 02:01:13,700
- What did they say?
- They're coming.

1094
02:01:13,810 --> 02:01:17,606
Good. Prepare the bed upstairs
for them.

1095
02:01:17,630 --> 02:01:18,930
- All right.
- Listen...

1096
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:22,700
- Yes?
- Well, nothing.

1097
02:02:21,450 --> 02:02:25,730
The first monsoon clouds have burst

1098
02:02:30,110 --> 02:02:34,430
Why are your eyes downcast
in a blush, my dear?

1099
02:03:15,490 --> 02:03:19,770
Friends, celebrate,
light the oil-lamps

1100
02:03:19,870 --> 02:03:24,390
Apply the sandalwood paste
on her forehead

1101
02:03:37,140 --> 02:03:41,140
Here she sits on a swing,
all decked out

1102
02:03:41,390 --> 02:03:45,510
On the sly, her man
tries to catch glimpses of her

1103
02:04:26,530 --> 02:04:30,640
Make a cradle of flowers

1104
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:35,150
A little darling is about to come

1105
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:52,510
Come, let's all celebrate
the occasion

1106
02:04:56,370 --> 02:05:00,350
Let's have
the prenatal celebration

1107
02:05:00,580 --> 02:05:04,960
Adorn her red veil with flowers

1108
02:05:08,870 --> 02:05:13,350
The first monsoon clouds
have burst

1109
02:05:13,490 --> 02:05:17,730
Why are your eyes downcast
in a blush, my dear?

1110
02:05:55,390 --> 02:05:59,360
I have to go home now. It's quite late
and he must be waiting for me.

1111
02:05:59,690 --> 02:06:04,020
Don't worry. We've told him
that you're sleeping here tonight.

1112
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:46,000
Who's there? Who?

1113
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:50,260
I'll kill you if you scream.

1114
02:06:51,210 --> 02:06:55,720
I'm a thief, a bandit!
Take off all your jewelry, come on.

1115
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:10,370
Enough, that's all.
More than enough.

1116
02:07:10,580 --> 02:07:13,170
Go on, open the door, quick.

1117
02:07:21,130 --> 02:07:22,230
Hurry!

1118
02:07:22,870 --> 02:07:27,740
- It's locked from the outside.
- Holler! Call them.

1119
02:07:28,710 --> 02:07:29,910
Call them!

1120
02:07:30,770 --> 02:07:32,600
- Anybody there?
- What is it, dear?

1121
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:36,360
- Open the door, please.
- I can understand.

1122
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:38,580
But I'm not going to open it
before dawn.

1123
02:07:39,850 --> 02:07:44,090
Tell them a thief has broken in
and your life is in danger.

1124
02:07:45,410 --> 02:07:48,140
A thief has broken in!
My life is in danger!

1125
02:07:48,590 --> 02:07:51,290
So he has disguised himself
as a thief.

1126
02:07:51,550 --> 02:07:55,610
Arun, don't play such a prank
on her, I warn you.

1127
02:07:59,690 --> 02:08:02,230
This is the limit!
I never knew you are such a fraud.

1128
02:08:16,110 --> 02:08:20,100
Look, I'm not at fault.
The old couple are at it.

1129
02:08:20,660 --> 02:08:24,230
As a thief I tried to escape,
but I goofed up.

1130
02:08:25,530 --> 02:08:28,910
Miss Mary, this is our final test.

1131
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:32,180
Assume for a while
that we are strangers...

1132
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:35,990
travelling in a train,
and it's night time.

1133
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:39,890
Consider the bed as the berth and go to
sleep. I can't think of anything more.

1134
02:08:40,270 --> 02:08:43,140
- Just manage till morning.
- Why wait till morning? Go away now.

1135
02:08:43,460 --> 02:08:47,550
- I know very well where you'll go.
- Yes, but which exit do I take?

1136
02:08:47,900 --> 02:08:50,570
I don't care. Take any exit,
but please go.

1137
02:08:51,390 --> 02:08:53,200
But there's no other exit.

1138
02:08:54,220 --> 02:08:57,430
Yes, I can jump off,
but it's too high.

1139
02:08:58,010 --> 02:09:02,680
- Besides, you wouldn't want me to jump.
- I'll show you another way. Come.

1140
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:14,330
- Sita!
- Coming, sister.

1141
02:09:25,370 --> 02:09:28,110
What? Arun jumped off and ran?

1142
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:30,560
Good Lord! He's such a daring boy.

1143
02:09:31,320 --> 02:09:33,560
Don't weep, child.
Go home if you want.

1144
02:09:34,070 --> 02:09:38,730
- But tell me what happened.
- Nothing. Please send me home quickly.

1145
02:09:39,170 --> 02:09:41,020
If you want to go home, sure.

1146
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:50,490
- Cash!
- Put it here.

1147
02:09:52,190 --> 02:09:53,390
Mr. Cash!

1148
02:09:57,420 --> 02:09:59,850
Guru-ji? Coming.

1149
02:10:04,720 --> 02:10:06,040
I'm opening it.

1150
02:10:14,010 --> 02:10:16,980
- Any problem, guru? You've come alone?
- I'm lucky to return alive.

1151
02:10:17,530 --> 02:10:20,230
- I almost died.
- Death be to your enemies.

1152
02:10:20,330 --> 02:10:24,120
- What's the matter anyway?
- The lady is leaving tomorrow.

1153
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:29,976
- I'm saved from this daily menace.
- It doesn't befit a man to succumb.

1154
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:33,190
- We won't let her go.
- Who's stopping her?

1155
02:10:33,530 --> 02:10:36,060
The old couple have
also given their consent.

1156
02:10:36,470 --> 02:10:40,130
- The matter is out of our hands now.
- Not yet, guru.

1157
02:10:40,330 --> 02:10:44,380
Guru, I've got an idea.
Promise me that you'll use it.

1158
02:10:44,710 --> 02:10:47,920
- What's the idea?
- Not so difficult.

1159
02:10:48,270 --> 02:10:52,540
What you do is
guzzle in a full bottle.

1160
02:10:53,240 --> 02:10:56,630
I'll tell the lady
you've got the loosies.

1161
02:10:56,700 --> 02:11:00,940
Out of fear, she might stay back.
Even if she doesn't change her mind...

1162
02:11:01,130 --> 02:11:06,540
- Mr. and Mrs. Rai won't let her leave.
- Cash, it's a nice idea.

1163
02:11:06,820 --> 02:11:09,350
- But I have a better idea.
- What's that?

1164
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:13,540
- I'll pretend my leg is broken.
- Why drag your leg into it?

1165
02:11:13,570 --> 02:11:14,970
Have patience, I'll explain.

1166
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,510
- Cash!
- She's here.

1167
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:21,370
Get a towel.

1168
02:11:27,090 --> 02:11:28,540
- I'm dead!
- Cash!

1169
02:11:29,380 --> 02:11:30,980
- You may leave.
- All right, madam.

1170
02:11:43,510 --> 02:11:47,350
- I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
- Leave me alone, please.

1171
02:11:47,690 --> 02:11:50,950
I must've done a good deed in the past.
That's why I got only a broken leg.

1172
02:11:51,220 --> 02:11:53,820
Had I fallen head first,
I'd have been history now.

1173
02:11:53,900 --> 02:11:57,220
It's human to err.
I'm lucky you're alive.

1174
02:11:57,330 --> 02:11:59,930
What kind of a joke is this?
Go away! Or do you want me to leave?

1175
02:12:00,540 --> 02:12:02,960
Please don't say that.
I said, I made a mistake.

1176
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:05,380
So you won't leave me alone?
Cash!

1177
02:12:12,820 --> 02:12:15,640
Don't worry guru. You'll be all right.

1178
02:12:28,810 --> 02:12:31,760
Don't worry, guru,
The lady will manage, of course.

1179
02:12:41,910 --> 02:12:43,110
Lie down.

1180
02:13:05,450 --> 02:13:10,140
- How's the pain now, guru?
- It's eased a bit. Feeling better.

1181
02:13:10,640 --> 02:13:16,090
I knew it! I knew, her touch
would ease your pain.

1182
02:13:16,510 --> 02:13:20,140
Some people are blessed with
a magic touch. You must sleep now.

1183
02:13:20,180 --> 02:13:23,140
- It'll rid you completely of the pain.
- Right. But how am I to sleep?

1184
02:13:23,780 --> 02:13:26,530
I'll sing you a lullaby
and put you to sleep in no time.

1185
02:13:40,380 --> 02:13:43,720
Enough. You'll drive my sleep away.

1186
02:13:43,870 --> 02:13:48,880
The lullaby wasn't so bad.
Oh, I know what you mean, guru.

1187
02:13:49,190 --> 02:13:54,920
You want the lady to sing one for you.
Yes, some people are amazing singers.

1188
02:13:55,480 --> 02:14:00,160
Lady, you sing for him.
He won't sleep otherwise.

1189
02:14:33,710 --> 02:14:38,070
The whole world is asleep...

1190
02:14:38,410 --> 02:14:43,150
yet I don't know why
I can't sleep

1191
02:14:43,350 --> 02:14:48,080
Oh breeze, why don't you...

1192
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:53,100
bring him along?

1193
02:15:29,420 --> 02:15:33,980
Never has the moon...

1194
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:38,290
shone like this before

1195
02:15:38,910 --> 02:15:43,490
What's so special tonight?

1196
02:15:43,730 --> 02:15:48,530
I fail to understand

1197
02:15:48,620 --> 02:15:53,110
The whole world is asleep...

1198
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:58,300
yet I don't know why
I can't sleep

1199
02:16:24,670 --> 02:16:29,930
The moonbeam says something
to the moon...

1200
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:33,650
before it falls on the earth

1201
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:38,790
I wonder what it finds on earth

1202
02:16:39,030 --> 02:16:43,790
It wouldn't turn back

1203
02:16:43,879 --> 02:16:48,199
The whole world is asleep...

1204
02:16:48,530 --> 02:16:53,320
yet I don't know why
I can't sleep

1205
02:16:53,389 --> 02:16:58,049
Oh breeze, why don't you...

1206
02:16:58,320 --> 02:17:02,900
bring him along?

1207
02:17:14,370 --> 02:17:17,860
- What have you come here for?
- As if you don't know.

1208
02:17:18,620 --> 02:17:24,460
- You love drew me here.
- Cut that love crap! Get out of here.

1209
02:17:25,250 --> 02:17:26,850
- You mean it?
- I mean it!

1210
02:17:27,160 --> 02:17:30,380
- Then give me my money!
- Money? We've already repaid it.

1211
02:17:30,430 --> 02:17:34,320
- In your dreams, maybe.
- Nonsense! I have the receipt.

1212
02:17:34,469 --> 02:17:35,869
- Want to see?
- Sure.

1213
02:17:41,940 --> 02:17:43,900
Wait, I'll come with you.

1214
02:17:52,750 --> 02:17:56,350
- What's this for you?
- Show me. This can't be my receipt.

1215
02:18:00,100 --> 02:18:02,200
Spit it out! Or I'll
wring your neck! Spit it out!

1216
02:18:03,190 --> 02:18:05,550
- Who are you?
- Behave yourself! He's my husband.

1217
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:11,010
How can you marry a Hindu?

1218
02:18:11,260 --> 02:18:14,460
- You hear? This girl is a Christian.
- Christian!

1219
02:18:14,559 --> 02:18:17,269
Good Lord! I thought she was
possessed by a Christian spirit.

1220
02:18:17,530 --> 02:18:21,440
I get it. They're enacting a farce,
playing husband and wife.

1221
02:18:21,549 --> 02:18:24,529
I'll tell Mr. Rai
and get them sacked.

1222
02:18:27,250 --> 02:18:32,760
One last chance. Let Mary go with me
or I'll turn you in for deceit.

1223
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:35,760
- You'll turn me in, eh?
- Yes.

1224
02:18:36,790 --> 02:18:38,390
Mr. John will never take lies.

1225
02:18:40,260 --> 02:18:41,460
Peace! Peace!

1226
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:50,020
So, do you consider me your husband?

1227
02:18:51,889 --> 02:18:53,289
Thanks a million, Lord.

1228
02:18:56,059 --> 02:18:57,689
What? What are you doing?

1229
02:19:05,629 --> 02:19:08,899
I see. So you've been
putting on an act since last night.

1230
02:19:09,219 --> 02:19:12,249
Weren't you putting on an act
all this while?

1231
02:19:13,309 --> 02:19:17,939
There's a limit to deceit. It gave
Cash an alibi to fleece me of 10 bucks.

1232
02:19:18,219 --> 02:19:22,559
So he didn't spare you either.
Forgive him, he's a friend.

1233
02:19:22,980 --> 02:19:27,240
John will come with Mr. Rai now.
What are we to tell him?

1234
02:19:27,520 --> 02:19:31,530
We'll tell him the truth.
At the most we'll be fired.

1235
02:19:35,629 --> 02:19:40,219
I swear on my Father, that girl is
a Christian. Her name is Mary D'souza.

1236
02:19:40,379 --> 02:19:42,195
And that boy is a Hindu.
They are not man and wife.

1237
02:19:42,219 --> 02:19:44,229
Convince me. Any proof?

1238
02:19:44,959 --> 02:19:47,739
I'll show you a letter
Mary wrote to her father.

1239
02:19:52,930 --> 02:19:55,800
- Where did you find this locket?
- It's mine.

1240
02:19:55,910 --> 02:19:58,080
No way! Speak the truth!
Who does it belong to?

1241
02:19:58,690 --> 02:20:03,890
It belonged to Mary's parents.
They gave it to me to repay a loan.

1242
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:07,850
Stay here quietly.
Chandragupta, put him at ease.

1243
02:20:14,490 --> 02:20:16,370
Aunt!

1244
02:20:16,660 --> 02:20:18,440
Aunt, does this locket
belong to Laxmi?

1245
02:20:20,340 --> 02:20:23,950
- It's Laxmi's. Where did you find it?
- Someone brought it from Bombay.

1246
02:20:24,220 --> 02:20:27,260
He says, the teacher's parents gave it
to him in lieu of money they owed him.

1247
02:20:27,570 --> 02:20:33,810
This is the one. And yes,
the teacher resembles our Laxmi.

1248
02:20:33,930 --> 02:20:37,640
- But he says she's a Christian.
- Maybe she was adopted?

1249
02:20:37,770 --> 02:20:40,160
- Right. Possible.
- Call your uncle.

1250
02:20:40,300 --> 02:20:43,360
- Let's go and find out.
- Uncle! Uncle!

1251
02:20:52,970 --> 02:20:55,020
My child, my dear...

1252
02:21:02,260 --> 02:21:04,620
- You're back?
- We brought him here.

1253
02:21:04,830 --> 02:21:08,180
- We want to know who you are.
- What else do you want to know?

1254
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:11,670
I've told you that my name is Mary
and I'm Christian by religion.

1255
02:21:11,710 --> 02:21:14,710
I'm not married yet,
and I'm going to marry Arun.

1256
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:19,570
You hear that? This girl is supposed
to get engaged to me...

1257
02:21:19,690 --> 02:21:22,690
and now she's going to marry him.
This is injustice!

1258
02:21:23,980 --> 02:21:25,960
Shut up! Look this way, please.

1259
02:21:26,610 --> 02:21:29,300
- Does this locket belong to you?
- Yes, it's mine.

1260
02:21:29,470 --> 02:21:31,710
- But how did it get here?
- This chap brought it.

1261
02:21:32,090 --> 02:21:34,300
He says your parents
gave it to him to repay a loan.

1262
02:21:34,380 --> 02:21:38,300
- He's lying. He must've stolen it.
- Stolen it? You mean I'm a thief?

1263
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:41,830
Possibly. Suppose what you say
turns out to be lies...

1264
02:21:42,180 --> 02:21:44,860
and what she says turns out to be true,
then what's your punishment?

1265
02:21:44,990 --> 02:21:47,860
In that case Mary can hit me
on the head with her sandals.

1266
02:21:48,610 --> 02:21:51,990
- Did you wear this locket as a child?
- No.

1267
02:21:52,190 --> 02:21:54,820
- Then how come it was in your house?
- I don't know all that.

1268
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:57,340
All I know is the locket
has been with us a long time.

1269
02:21:57,840 --> 02:21:59,430
- Are your parents alive?
- Yes.

1270
02:21:59,660 --> 02:22:02,900
- What must be their age?
- Papa is 60 and Mummy is about 50.

1271
02:22:03,060 --> 02:22:06,370
- Wrong. They are much older.
- Shut up.

1272
02:22:07,320 --> 02:22:10,100
- Any siblings?
- None. I'm their only daughter.

1273
02:22:10,350 --> 02:22:13,490
Right. No brothers, no sisters,
and the parents were quite old then.

1274
02:22:13,660 --> 02:22:16,850
Considering this, there's
a possibility you were adopted.

1275
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,500
- Right. You have a point.
- Nonsense.

1276
02:22:19,880 --> 02:22:25,050
- Why are you cross questioning me?
- Peace. No need to get worked up.

1277
02:22:25,510 --> 02:22:29,470
From what you say, it's quite clear
you're not their real child.

1278
02:22:30,010 --> 02:22:33,620
Fifty percent of the case is proved.
Fifty still eludes.

1279
02:22:34,270 --> 02:22:37,590
Show us your right leg.
We might find a mole.

1280
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:41,660
Aren't you ashamed to talk like this?
If you want me to work here, fine.

1281
02:22:41,780 --> 02:22:45,070
Else, I'll quit. But you have
no right to humiliate me like this.

1282
02:22:45,330 --> 02:22:48,250
Cash, call your guru here.
We'll leave right away.

1283
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:51,930
Calm down, dear. No one
is asking you to quit the job.

1284
02:22:52,170 --> 02:22:56,920
Sir, this is unfair. You are
a gentleman. You ought to deliver justice.

1285
02:22:57,030 --> 02:22:59,810
I'm going to marry her.
Please send her with me.

1286
02:23:00,260 --> 02:23:04,190
Lay off, scoundrel! Look,
you don't know who this girl is.

1287
02:23:04,530 --> 02:23:07,110
If you don't behave yourself,
I'll boot you out!

1288
02:23:07,230 --> 02:23:11,920
Uncle, why must you dirty your shoes?
The lady's sandals can do a better job.

1289
02:23:12,320 --> 02:23:15,520
There's something between the two,
I guess. Let them sort it out.

1290
02:23:15,580 --> 02:23:18,120
I found it!
I found the mole!

1291
02:23:18,790 --> 02:23:21,810
- She's our Laxmi.
- You are my child!

1292
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:25,160
My darling! God has answered
my prayers.

1293
02:23:25,360 --> 02:23:27,836
- No! I'm not your child.
- My sister Laxmi!

1294
02:23:27,860 --> 02:23:31,320
- I'm not your sister! I'm not!
- You mustn't say that.

1295
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:35,166
- I'm not your daughter.
- Don't say that.

1296
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:39,486
- I'm not your daughter!
- You don't know, but I'm your mother.

1297
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:42,710
And I'm your little sister.
My sister is so pretty!

1298
02:23:43,530 --> 02:23:45,850
What's going on?
What fuss is this?

1299
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:52,490
Chandragupta, escort the Romeo
to the police station.

1300
02:23:52,820 --> 02:23:55,150
No, not the police station!

1301
02:23:57,960 --> 02:24:02,400
- Save me. They think I'm a thief.
- He's a bandit in fact.

1302
02:24:02,860 --> 02:24:04,560
Take him right
to the police station.

1303
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:07,980
You must be Mary's parents.

1304
02:24:09,370 --> 02:24:11,200
Go on, they're waiting for you.

1305
02:24:12,430 --> 02:24:16,750
Chandragupta, this day is auspicious!
We've also found Mary's guardians.

1306
02:24:18,770 --> 02:24:20,780
You're back? Take him
to the police station.

1307
02:24:26,150 --> 02:24:30,350
- My child.
- Papa, they say I'm their daughter.

1308
02:24:30,660 --> 02:24:32,880
- Make them see reason, Papa.
- Yes, my child.

1309
02:24:34,160 --> 02:24:36,010
It's true that you aren't our daughter.

1310
02:24:37,490 --> 02:24:39,580
We found you in Nasik
sixteen years ago.

1311
02:24:40,740 --> 02:24:46,570
We tried our best to find
your real parents, but we failed.

1312
02:24:48,060 --> 02:24:52,070
We were childless,
so we considered you...

1313
02:24:52,110 --> 02:24:56,570
the gift of the Merciful Jesus Christ
and raised you.

1314
02:24:57,710 --> 02:25:00,640
My child, you are not our blood.

1315
02:25:01,670 --> 02:25:05,460
If the problem stands here, then
my child, they are your parents.

1316
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:06,960
My daughter!

1317
02:25:07,260 --> 02:25:13,080
Sita, didn't I tell you she looks
exactly like your sister? I was right.

1318
02:25:14,070 --> 02:25:15,270
My child...

1319
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:21,406
- Don't talk to me.
- My nice little sister.

1320
02:25:21,430 --> 02:25:24,980
- Go away.
- My lovely sister, my little doll.

1321
02:25:25,370 --> 02:25:27,510
- Go away. - My princess.
- My kid - Leave me alone.

1322
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:35,660
So far they've been brawling,
and look at the affection now.

1323
02:25:37,110 --> 02:25:40,980
Uncle, I safely took Mr. John
to the police station.

1324
02:25:41,130 --> 02:25:42,440
Well done.

1325
02:25:42,880 --> 02:25:47,530
Raju is my friend's son. He's been
with us since he was a child.

1326
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:50,590
He's one of the best detectives
in India.

1327
02:25:52,030 --> 02:25:55,040
The credit of finding Laxmi
also goes to him.

1328
02:25:55,460 --> 02:25:59,660
So he deserves to marry
my daughter Sita. And I consent.

1329
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:03,200
And Arun, B.A,
you are marrying Laxmi.

1330
02:26:04,700 --> 02:26:08,280
And I get the dough.
Out with it.

1331
02:26:10,190 --> 02:26:13,820
- Dough, guru?
- No more fleecing.

1332
02:26:14,180 --> 02:26:17,236
Good. Then I'm on my way.

1333
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:19,890
- Where to?
- Exile.

1334
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:22,200
Here I find myself out of place now.

1335
02:26:22,750 --> 02:26:26,060
You're supposed to get going. No, wait.

1336
02:26:27,870 --> 02:26:29,070
Some dough?
