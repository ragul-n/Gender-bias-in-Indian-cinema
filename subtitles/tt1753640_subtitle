1
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,534
''Why do you always..''

2
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:03,541
''..talk about money?''

3
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:05,543
''Tell me something..

4
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:10,309
..why don't you fear God?''

5
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:14,480
''Money.''

6
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:19,958
''What is money? I'll get
in abundance for you.''

7
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:27,160
''I'll shower money on
you if you become mine.''

8
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,737
''I'll shower money on
you if you become mine.''

9
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,366
''Boy, can't you see?''

10
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:36,408
''Like a girl you want me to be?''

11
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:38,374
''My love is precious, baby.''

12
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:39,603
''No money can buy me.''

13
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:44,582
Hello? How are you, Uncle?
Bittu is absolutely fine.

14
00:01:45,218 --> 00:01:47,618
Everything is fine here.
Don't worry.

15
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:49,515
Hey!

16
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,982
What?

17
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:53,392
yes, Uncle. - Can't you
see there's a film going on?

18
00:01:53,827 --> 00:01:56,625
So let it go on. Why are
you getting irritated?

19
00:01:58,498 --> 00:02:02,127
yes, Uncle. I heard about
my cousin too. - Let it be.

20
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:03,929
He got only one
vote in the elections?

21
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:06,071
Hang up. I said hang up.

22
00:02:07,374 --> 00:02:12,778
Listen when you're kissing,
I don't disturb you.

23
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,112
So why are you disturbing me?

24
00:02:16,383 --> 00:02:17,873
And you want me to hang up?

25
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:19,946
yes, Uncle, I was saying..

26
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,551
Uncle.

27
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:26,686
your stupid nephew will call
you after the film gets over.

28
00:02:31,064 --> 00:02:33,055
Sorry, very sorry.

29
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,468
''Boy, can't you see?''

30
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:37,696
''Like a girl you want me to be?''

31
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,671
''My love is precious,
baby. No money can buy me.''

32
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:41,900
Don't you dare take the call!

33
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:48,776
Hi, Uncle. There's no problem.

34
00:02:49,149 --> 00:02:50,946
Don't.
- I met an old friend of mine.

35
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:52,211
He was telling me.. Hey!

36
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:54,682
Give me the cell-phone!
Give me the phone!

37
00:02:54,788 --> 00:02:56,881
I said give me the phone. Hey!

38
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,685
you threw my phone!
How dare you touch it?

39
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:02,295
Stop!
- How dare you do that!

40
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:04,420
Stop!
- It will cost you dearly!

41
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:08,729
What happened to my job?

42
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:11,267
yes, I'm just
uploading it right now.

43
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:12,802
Is everything all right?

44
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:15,464
There's a minor
problem in the item song.

45
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:17,275
Otherwise the rest of
the film is a super hit.

46
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:19,471
Will the film become a success?
- Just like Sholay.

47
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:21,303
Send it on time.
- yes, okay.

48
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,872
A hit film is coming. - Next Friday
again? - yes, brother.

49
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,383
yes, okay. Bye.

50
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:29,181
What are you up to?

51
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:34,290
Uncle? Nothing. Just
doing some research.

52
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:39,331
There's no point in hiding this.

53
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,033
The police have traced your upload.

54
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:47,539
They were coming to get you,
but my reputation saved you.

55
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:52,502
you caused me a loss..
- They would have handcuffed you.

56
00:03:53,947 --> 00:03:55,539
How many times have I
tried to explain it to you?

57
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:57,310
What are you doing?
- How many times have I saved you?

58
00:03:57,384 --> 00:04:01,480
yet every time you manage
to do something illegal.

59
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:03,986
It doesn't make any
difference to you.

60
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:05,388
you'll never change.

61
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:09,060
Do you even know the people you're
sending this pirated film to?

62
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:10,655
They're gangsters.

63
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,699
your father had left them
and you're going back to them.

64
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:17,270
I will go. Do you have any problem?

65
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:18,868
Doesn't it make any
difference to you?

66
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:20,534
I've loved you more than a son.

67
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,006
Educated you and raised you.

68
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:23,166
Doesn't it make any
difference to you?

69
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:24,505
you didn't do me any favour!

70
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:26,745
My father was trying
to do a good thing.

71
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:29,642
you talked him into
going to the police.

72
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,242
What happened to him?

73
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:40,090
your father was a good man. His
blood runs through your veins.

74
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,659
Please, son..

75
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:45,253
Nobody gives me a job
because of my father's name.

76
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,226
A thief's son will be a thief..

77
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:50,197
A gangster's son will be a gangster.

78
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:51,931
That's how your world thinks.

79
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:54,338
Son, there is good in you.

80
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,338
you'll be a good man.

81
00:04:56,876 --> 00:05:00,778
I believe in this.
There's God in every one of us.

82
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:03,613
your God is not interested in me.

83
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:09,110
I'm bad and will stay bad.

84
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:12,018
It's good to be bad, you know.

85
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:18,161
I'll do for you what I
couldn't do for your father.

86
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:23,596
Even if I have to sell my
house or encash my fixed deposits..

87
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:26,171
..or anything else.
I'll get you out of here.

88
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:29,204
If you stay here, you'll
mingle with these gangsters..

89
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:30,604
..and I for one will
not let that happen.

90
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:33,538
Just..

91
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:40,047
Just promise me you won't
do anything wrong. Please.

92
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:45,819
My hands will be in my pockets.

93
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:48,324
I won't get into any trouble.
I promise. Now tell me.

94
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:51,457
I have a few friends
in Australia. I can..

95
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:53,294
Be it America, Dubai or Australia..

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,230
..I won't get a visa
because of my father's name.

97
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:58,363
I'm a policeman.

98
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,231
If I can change your location..

99
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,399
..then I can change your
complete identity too.

100
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:37,903
Excuse me. In the line.

101
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:52,547
Hello.
- yes.

102
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:54,252
Hi.

103
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:57,326
No English.
- It's okay.

104
00:06:57,464 --> 00:06:58,590
Help.

105
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:06,131
Can I?

106
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:07,968
Okay.

107
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:13,946
you can come too.

108
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:19,983
By the way, I never do this.
This is the first and last time.

109
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:21,379
Thank you.

110
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:22,614
No problem.

111
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:24,288
you should learn to
make your own line.

112
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:27,455
Be it in an airport or your destiny.

113
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:34,090
Suraj Bhardwaj from Mumbai.

114
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:36,999
Romi Latti, from Gurdaspur.

115
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:40,530
First time in Australia?

116
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:42,599
yes. you?

117
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:44,302
yes.

118
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:46,570
Thank you.

119
00:07:46,713 --> 00:07:50,376
I've come on the McCarthy
scholarship from Taylor College.

120
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:51,943
Did you get any scholarship?

121
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:55,150
Do I look like I'm capable
of getting a scholarship?

122
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:56,882
Absolutely not.

123
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:00,848
No scholarship.

124
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:03,691
The college must have
sent a pick up for me.

125
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:04,989
What about you?

126
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:06,927
I'm going to take a taxi.

127
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:09,129
Taxi.

128
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:44,569
I think your pick up
service is that way.

129
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:46,568
Romi Latti from Hoshiyaarpur

130
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:51,568
It's Gurdaspur. Okay, all the best.

131
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:11,222
Romi?

132
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:13,825
Romi Latti. McCarthy Scholarship.

133
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:18,163
Hi. Suhani. I've come to pick
you up. Shall we? - Let's go.

134
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:42,455
What?

135
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:45,557
No nothing. Just seeing you..

136
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,463
Seeing me what?

137
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:51,197
you don't look like
you're from Punjab.

138
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:58,299
Because I'm quite good looking?
Where are you from?

139
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:02,413
My passport's Australian, but
my heart is 100 percent Indian.

140
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:03,812
'Welcome to Melbourne and this
is the Suhani and David show.'

141
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,111
Two in one, you know.

142
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:06,583
'Desi show for Desi kids.'

143
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:10,645

Indian and Australian cultures..'

144
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:12,984
'..and helps Indian students.'

145
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:15,823
Our helpline is
accessible 24/7 for you.

146
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:17,388
'Please call.'

147
00:10:17,463 --> 00:10:18,657
Two in one?

148
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:20,365
It's pre-recorded.

149
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:22,059
Wow!

150
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:25,702
A pencil in your hair
and bangles on your hand.

151
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:28,298
you seem like the
Mother-India type.

152
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:30,868
Any problem with that?

153
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:32,138
No, no. No problem at all.

154
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:34,573
Just felt this way after
listening to you on this helpline.

155
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:38,341
you know I feel that people
who are new to Australia..

156
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:41,519
..should learn about
Australian culture.

157
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:45,848
Actually, you're right. Should
we meet over lunch tomorrow?

158
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:48,251
To learn about Australian culture.

159
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:51,328
We're already
meeting for lunch tomorrow.

160
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:53,359
We are?

161
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,093
My brother didn't
mention it in his email?

162
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:57,995
your brother?

163
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:02,703
Listen. Before you say anything,
I know why you've come here..

164
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:08,871
..I know who you are
and I can't marry you.

165
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:10,476
What?

166
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,780
Romi, I know
according to my brother..

167
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:14,443
..you're a perfect match for me.

168
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:16,018
you've come on a scholarship..

169
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:18,482
..and we are from the
village etc. etc. but..

170
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:21,651
Hello! Even I can't
marry you. Understand?

171
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:25,291
Wow!

172
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:29,831
There's no need to be so happy.
I'm not that bad.

173
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:33,761
No, no. I mean if my brother finds
out, he's not going to be too happy.

174
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:37,535
Can't you complete any sentence
without your brother involved?

175
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:42,174
And I'm sure your brother
would also be present for lunch.

176
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:47,217
you want some chips?

177
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,714
For lunch?

178
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:52,857
We'll get a Sim-card for you too.

179
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:54,452
No. There's no need for that.

180
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:57,126
Don't worry. I'm not paying for it.

181
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,222
Our radio show has a
charity fund which pays for this.

182
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,494
And besides, we must
take good care of you..

183
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:04,092
..since you're a
scholarship student. - yes.

184
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,397
There should be some advantage
of being a scholarship student.

185
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:09,032
So then Coke,
Pepsi, water, anything?

186
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:11,770
What should I be drinking as
per the Australian culture?

187
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:15,812
And if your radio show
funds people like me..

188
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:17,772
..then it will go
bankrupt in two days.

189
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:20,017
Try to do something
for others sometimes.

190
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:22,246
It feels good. you
should really try it.

191
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:34,166
Don't pull the
innocent girl's leg so much..

192
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:37,097
..Romi Latti from Hoshiyaarpur.

193
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:45,569
Hello. - Miss Suhani this is
Romi Latti from Gurdaspur.

194
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:48,408
Romi? - I'm not speaking
from Gurdaspur airport.

195
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:50,948
I'm standing at the airport and
there's no here to pick me up.

196
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:52,382
So..
- It's been half an hour.

197
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:54,511
I'm just standing.
Nothing's happening. What do I do?

198
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:57,112
Wait there. I'm coming.
- Okay.

199
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:13,236
Golde.

200
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:16,534
Gold with an E.

201
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:17,700
I'm Jolly.

202
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:19,472
I'm Popli.
- Lovely.

203
00:13:19,545 --> 00:13:21,604
Happy.
- Pinky.

204
00:13:21,781 --> 00:13:26,013
Listen, Suraj. Don't think
that Golde will have mercy on you.

205
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:27,848
Golde is a very
strict man. It's a fact.

206
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:29,080
It's a fact.
- It's a fact.

207
00:13:29,188 --> 00:13:30,553
It's a fact.
- It's a fact.

208
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:31,749
It's a fact.

209
00:13:31,824 --> 00:13:34,588
And in Golde's house,
you'll have to split the rent..

210
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,060
..and help in all the
household work with your hands only.

211
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,030
It's a fact.
- It's a fact.

212
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:41,066
It's a fact.
- It's a fact. - It's a fact.

213
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:44,331
Mrs. Golde, the fact is that
money is a bit of a problem.

214
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:46,665
Golde gives no lock
without its key.

215
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:48,601
I've secured your
admission in college..

216
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:50,533
..which gives you a
visa for 11 months.

217
00:13:50,877 --> 00:13:55,644
As for the money, in half an
hour Samarth from Gurdaspur..

218
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:59,582
..will meet you at the taxi stand.
He has a taxi business.

219
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:02,382
So you're going to
become a taxi driver.

220
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,080
Taxi Driver?
- yes!

221
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:08,217
There's big dollars
in the taxi business

222
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:10,525
All for PR.

223
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:14,193
PR?

224
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,858
''I need PR.''

225
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:17,527
''Darling, I need PR.''

226
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:20,595
''Darling, I need PR.''

227
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:21,798
No, no. I'm okay.

228
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,943
you don't want PR?

229
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:27,843
Have you come to
play ludo in Australia?

230
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:31,746
Without Permanent Residency
there's no point in being here.

231
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:36,221
you meant PR?

232
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:37,756
There are two ways to get your PR.

233
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:39,749
One, there are agencies.

234
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:41,052
Give them money..

235
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:43,391
..and they'll give you a
work experience certificate.

236
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:46,288
Once you get it. Next
you'll attain your PR.

237
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,031
And the second?

238
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:52,231
The second way is to entice an
Australian girl and marry her.

239
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:53,565
Formula No.2.

240
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,539
Exactly! Which we
are not interested in.

241
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:57,439
That's a fact. Right, Brother
Golde? - you're absolutely right.

242
00:14:57,543 --> 00:14:59,170
Put some more spice.
- I'm doing that.

243
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:01,944
Brother Golde, can I
tell you something?

244
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:07,917
Brother, this taxi
method is very long. - I see.

245
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:10,020
Why don't we use the second method?

246
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:11,852
Get an Australian girl
and save the taxi's fuel.

247
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:15,360
I can teach you some
tricks to get girls.

248
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:17,827
Don't act over smart with Golde.

249
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:20,991
It's a fact. We will
take the longer route.

250
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,694
The rest of you do your work.
Everyone gives big talks.

251
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:26,499
Teach me a couple of
tricks please. Golde's gone.

252
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:27,930
Come on.

253
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:29,966
Here keep this card.

254
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:33,970
Now I wanted to tell you, if
you fail this driving test..

255
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:36,808
..I'll make you wash dishes
in some Chinese restaurant..

256
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:41,012
..to get my money. Okay?
It's a fact. Get out of here.

257
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:42,687
Come. Come in.

258
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:46,748
And listen, this area,
Kings Street, is our own.

259
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,127
Beyond this everything
else here isn't safe for you.

260
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:53,761
And make sure you always
stay away from the police.

261
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:54,993
This is a fact you need to remember.

262
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:56,329
It's a fact. It's a fact.
- yes, very good.

263
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:57,595
I got it. Now let's go.
- Come on.

264
00:15:57,703 --> 00:15:58,897
Come on. - Now drop him off
to Samarth's. - Okay, sir.

265
00:15:58,971 --> 00:16:00,165
All the best.
- Bye.

266
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:08,043
This man is a bit intimidating.
Mind it.

267
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:15,913
How did you get this
scratch on the cab?

268
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:19,048
What did I do? That Australian
customer started telling me..

269
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,093
''you Afghanis have come
here and corrupted our land.''

270
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:23,486
Now you tell me. Do I look Afghani?

271
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:25,325
I am a pure bred Sikh.

272
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:27,697
But how did you get this scratch?

273
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:32,696
Well, I told him,
''Afghanis have done nothing.''

274
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:34,329
''you guys went and
bombed their land.''

275
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:38,500
He basically got angry
and then scratched my cab.

276
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:42,174
And you let him go?

277
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:45,280
yes, I let him go.

278
00:16:50,523 --> 00:16:51,649
Golde has sent you?

279
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:54,652
yes.

280
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:57,755
you want to drive a taxi?

281
00:16:58,664 --> 00:16:59,756
yes.

282
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:01,123
Why?

283
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:07,966
Sir, ever since I was a
little kid I had only one dream..

284
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,141
..to grow up and
become a taxi driver.

285
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:13,108
What would you do if you
were in Jolly's position?

286
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:20,117
I'd beat up that Australian.
How dare he scratch the cab?

287
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:21,480
Romi Latti will tell you.

288
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:24,082
Where are you from?
- Don't you know Hindi?

289
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,887
I do know it.

290
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:28,158
Mother India.
- What?

291
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:30,761
From India, sir.

292
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,899
Brother..
- Welcome, Mr. Latti.

293
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,396
Hello.
- Hello! All is well? - yes.

294
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:38,561
Very good. Go fetch
his bags from the car.

295
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:39,763
I'll get it.
- I'll come with you.

296
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:41,169
No you wait here. I'll get it.

297
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:46,204
No scholarship,
what a luck by chance.

298
00:17:46,312 --> 00:17:47,836
Suraj Bhardwaj from Mumbai.

299
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:49,439
you know him?

300
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:51,038
yes, we met..
- I know him very well.

301
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,674
Romi Latti from Hoshiyaarpur.

302
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:53,979
Luck by chance

303
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:55,645
It's Gurdaspur.
- yes.

304
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:57,745
Why did you guys reach so late?

305
00:17:57,857 --> 00:18:01,020
Brother, at the airport some
idiot sat in Suhanis car..

306
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:03,789
..claiming to be me.
- Sir, I'll take your leave.

307
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:05,490
Suhani, why didn't you
tell me what happened?

308
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:08,032
That's what I'm telling you.
- Sir, I'll leave.

309
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:10,134
It slipped my mind.

310
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:14,767
That happens sometimes.
Brother, don't mind.

311
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:17,138
How the heck did it
slip out of your mind?

312
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,777
If I find him, I'll break his bones.

313
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,013
Relax, brother.
There's no need for that.

314
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:25,178
If I find him, I'll tell you.
But it was nothing serious.

315
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:28,381
Sir, I'll leave?

316
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:31,488
Why? Don't want to drive a cab?

317
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:35,292
No, I thought I failed the test.

318
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:38,895
Come and collect the
taxi tomorrow morning.

319
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:40,598
I'll get your license made.

320
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:46,270
Thank you, sir. Ma'am.
Romi Latti from Hoshiyaarpur.

321
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:47,634
It's Gurdaspur.

322
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:53,608
Uncle, you have
nothing to worry about.

323
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,374
I've got a good job here.

324
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:56,745
Thank God.
- I suggest you too come here.

325
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:57,976
What's in a policeman's job?

326
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:00,777
Everything is set for me.
Formula no.2.. - Hi.

327
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:03,751
Move! What the heck?

328
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:06,454
And I'll hit the jackpot.

329
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,461
Once I get my Australian passport,
my life will be sorted. - yes.

330
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:14,556
'Last week a student of
Indian origin was attacked..'

331
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:15,725
'..who lost his life.'

332
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:17,462
Jai, the news here is
constantly talking about..

333
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:18,730
..Australians
beating some Indian up.

334
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:21,531
I hope you're not
getting into any trouble there.

335
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:25,202
you need to stop watching TV.
They constantly exaggerate.

336
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:26,943
If it were upto them..

337
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:30,381
..women would kill
their daughters-in-law..

338
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:33,145
..and then the daughters-in-law
will be reborn to take revenge.

339
00:19:33,886 --> 00:19:35,183
What are you doing?

340
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:36,915
Nobody move! Nobody do anything!

341
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:39,013
Stop it, I said.

342
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:41,117
Hello.
- Give me all your money.

343
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:42,285
I'll call you later.

344
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:48,095
Is this it? Is this all you've got?
- Please leave me.

345
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,101
Watch the door. Open this.

346
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:51,963
Please leave me.

347
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:55,301
Who's this? Who's this?

348
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,806
She's my wife. I'm married.
Please don't kill me.

349
00:19:59,044 --> 00:20:01,604
She's Australian.
Please don't kill me.

350
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:04,906
Leave me please. Please.

351
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:07,451
Leave me please.

352
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:11,620
He sounded the alarm! Watch the
door! I told you not to do this!

353
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,659
I told you not to do anything!
Now you're going to regret it!

354
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,124
Please.
- Come here, you little crap.

355
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,096
What are you thinking?
you can get away with this?

356
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,359
Get out of here!
- Please leave me.

357
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:26,302
you Paki! you are nothing,
but a pain in the neck.

358
00:20:26,372 --> 00:20:27,703
Oh, God!

359
00:20:28,374 --> 00:20:29,671
Quick! Quick!

360
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:34,543
Marrying our women.
- Come on! What are you waiting for?

361
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:36,237
you know how we can
get rid of this pain?

362
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:38,446
Hey, man! Let's go out!
- If we don't get out.

363
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:39,813
Come on. Come on, quick.

364
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:45,816
We cut it off. We cut it off.

365
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:48,155
Hey, guys. Hey whoa!

366
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,730
I was just leaving and you can
do whatever you're doing there.

367
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:57,101
I don't want any trouble, guys.

368
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:04,541
Look who we have here.
Another Paki brother.

369
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:08,611
No we're not. Actually,
it's very complicated.

370
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:11,878
See no evil hear no evil, man.
Seriously. Honestly.

371
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:13,976
The cops are going to
be here. Russ, leave!

372
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:16,453
Avoid all trouble.
Avoid all trouble.

373
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:19,256
What are you doing? Just leave him.
- Oh, no!

374
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:22,058
Let's get out of here!

375
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:30,868
I'm a goner if the police
find me. I'm sorry. Very sorry.

376
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,201
Listen, please.
Please help me. Please..

377
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:47,574
Thank God that you
were here, otherwise..

378
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,051
Don't trust God so much..

379
00:21:50,055 --> 00:21:51,716
..because you were
going to him pretty soon.

380
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,151
you've helped a devotee of Allah..

381
00:21:58,163 --> 00:21:59,858
..and He'll surely
help you in return.

382
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:01,729
Just hang in there.
Okay? Help is on its way

383
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:09,231
Don't go from there.
Take this back door.

384
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:25,586
What's your problem?

385
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:27,489
What, are you scared now?
- Have you gone insane?

386
00:22:27,593 --> 00:22:29,618
What so are you scared now?
- Didn't you see that?

387
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:31,287
We just went there for the money.
- He was with one of our women.

388
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:33,627
Those curry boys come in
here and marry our women.

389
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:37,261
you don't even care.
Just mind your own business.

390
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:40,961
Just keep to yourselves. Back off.
- Come on. Let's go.

391
00:22:46,745 --> 00:22:49,145
Where are you going?
Where are you going? - Stop.

392
00:22:49,214 --> 00:22:50,738
What happened to you?
- Russell, stop.

393
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:53,307
Where are you going?
- Hey, stop. Russ!

394
00:23:26,385 --> 00:23:27,818
How are doing, Nicky?

395
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:31,355
Step away from the car, Russ.

396
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:35,123
I'm just looking out
for my baby sister.

397
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:39,126
There's a curry boy
around and I don't want..

398
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:42,359
I can look after myself. Okay?

399
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:06,716
you can come out now.
We're out of there.

400
00:24:08,494 --> 00:24:09,756
I don't bite.

401
00:24:12,898 --> 00:24:14,456
Why don't you come sit up here?

402
00:24:25,177 --> 00:24:26,940
It's a bad world out there.

403
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,444
yes, it's good to be bad.

404
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,680
Sorry about my brother.
He's a bit wonkers.

405
00:24:40,225 --> 00:24:42,193
Is every girl's
brother a little crazy?

406
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:44,860
What?
- No. Nothing

407
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:51,600
Here hold the wheel. Take it.
- Okay.

408
00:24:59,545 --> 00:25:00,705
What the heck is going on?

409
00:25:07,152 --> 00:25:08,312
Can you hook me up?

410
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:10,852
Okay.

411
00:25:11,723 --> 00:25:15,352
Was getting late for work. I
usually do this in the car.

412
00:25:15,661 --> 00:25:18,027
But seeing that I had to save
you from the mean street guys.

413
00:25:18,096 --> 00:25:19,222
I hope you don't mind

414
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:23,894
No. you can change
again if you want. Go on.

415
00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:25,129
yes.
- yes.

416
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:35,176
It's safe from here on.

417
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:38,974
yes, but who likes safe.

418
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:53,760
Suraj, by the way

419
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:57,195
Catch you sometime, Suraj,
by the way.

420
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:00,395
Okay.

Stop dancing!

432
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:47,717
Should I give you a pillow?
- What did I do?

433
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:50,081
What are you doing? Are
you in love with the grass?

434
00:26:50,355 --> 00:26:51,515
Spray over there as well.

435
00:26:51,623 --> 00:26:52,954
Everyone's come

436
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:59,561
Mr. Lazy! Come here!
Hello? Listen, brother!

437
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,666
How sweet you look in
the water! Come here.

438
00:27:04,836 --> 00:27:06,064
What do you think you're doing?

439
00:27:08,073 --> 00:27:10,371
He's working. Popli's working.
What do you think you're doing?

440
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:13,002
Golde, I'm completing your job.

441
00:27:13,178 --> 00:27:14,543
Formula no.2 is perfect for me.

442
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,208
Formula no.2?

443
00:27:16,648 --> 00:27:18,741
Whatever it is, finish
your work as fast as you can.

444
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:20,250
Golde wants results.

445
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:22,649
We need to go to get our
revenge from the British.

446
00:27:23,088 --> 00:27:24,214
Revenge?

447
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:26,120
Just come this evening to
Dukes Club, Kings Street.

448
00:27:26,224 --> 00:27:28,283
Now go finish your work fast.
you guys continue.

449
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:32,124
Hurry! you promised.
- yes, I'm doing it.

450
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:41,334
Come here! Come down!
Whose house is this? - your.

451
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,235
Golde's house. Gold with an E!

452
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:45,305
Hello.
- Am I speaking to Suhani?

453
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,707
yes, your name please.

454
00:27:46,845 --> 00:27:51,441
I'm Golde. Gold with an E. Golde.

455
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,815
yes, Golde. Tell me
how can we help you?

456
00:27:54,886 --> 00:27:57,878
Actually, my boss is troubling me.

457
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:01,859
He's paying me less than the
Australians because I'm an Indian.

458
00:28:02,227 --> 00:28:07,062
It's really a tragic fact.
Come and see for yourself.

459
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:09,158
Golde, where do you work?

460
00:28:09,468 --> 00:28:16,567
Dukes Club, Kings Street.
It is better you come.

461
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,002
Okay, I'll be there.

462
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:21,744
Okay. See you.

463
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:26,979
What is Dukes Club?

464
00:28:27,052 --> 00:28:28,576
Join! Join! Join!

465
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:31,253
Steam it up and strip it down.

466
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:34,352
Girls will turn you on!

467
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:36,892
Welcome to the Duke's club.

468
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:42,555
Revenge from the British!

469
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:44,567
We'll attack these women.

470
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:45,795
Now where will these
foreigners run off to?

471
00:28:45,904 --> 00:28:46,996
Rascals!

472
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:48,800
Why didn't you tell me
earlier that this was a strip club?

473
00:28:48,907 --> 00:28:51,398
Why, brother? Do you have a
problem with half naked women?

474
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:55,270
Hold on. I hope you
don't swing the other way.

475
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:56,472
Other way?

476
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:58,549
you know gay!

477
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:01,349
If I was actually gay, it
would've saved me today.

478
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,878
you seem to be staring at all
the women. Listen don't stare.

479
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,753
Because you'll land up
paying for that too.

480
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:08,986
Just choose a girl.
I'll get her for you.

481
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:10,119
Stay here.

482
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:11,388
How do you like the golden girl?

483
00:29:11,463 --> 00:29:12,589
Stay here I'm going.

484
00:29:12,664 --> 00:29:13,926
She's staring at you. Just see her.

485
00:29:14,032 --> 00:29:15,624
Oh, no!

486
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:19,736
Hello. How are you?

487
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:23,602
Suhani! Hi.

488
00:29:24,342 --> 00:29:25,934
I'm leaving. I'm running away.

489
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:27,410
Wait here.

490
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:29,173
Okay, bye. Hit on her.

491
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:32,239
Just wait a second. He's mad.
- Don't miss this chance.

492
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:34,511
you had called right?

493
00:29:37,622 --> 00:29:39,988
And I'm sure there's no
problem with your boss.

494
00:29:42,694 --> 00:29:44,161
And your name is not Golde either.

495
00:29:44,262 --> 00:29:46,127
So you've come here alone?

496
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,262
No, I'm not talking
about your sister.

497
00:29:53,338 --> 00:29:54,600
your brother didn't come with you.

498
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:57,206
He doesn't like clubs in general..

499
00:29:57,509 --> 00:29:59,909
..and in fact he has a
major problem with strip clubs.

500
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:04,176
That's the right way to think.
Even I don't like this place.

501
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:07,814
I mean my friends forced
me so I had to come here.

502
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:13,354
Sorry. I actually
called you to say sorry..

503
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:15,484
..for the other day at the airport.

504
00:30:16,027 --> 00:30:19,656
Okay. Let me get this straight.
you lied and called me here..

505
00:30:19,731 --> 00:30:23,258
..so that you could
apologise for lying the first time.

506
00:30:23,768 --> 00:30:26,293
I just have a habit of
fooling around, you know.

507
00:30:26,505 --> 00:30:30,100
And thank you for not
ratting me out to your brother.

508
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:33,538
you know I would have if
you hadn't left the car.

509
00:30:34,312 --> 00:30:35,904
I thought you were
guilty or something.

510
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:38,614
But now I think I've
made a mistake, you know.

511
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:42,414
No, no. Don't change your mind.
I'll take you some place else.

512
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:44,387
Why? What's wrong with a strip club?

513
00:30:44,456 --> 00:30:49,052
No. I don't like it here.
I feel suffocated

514
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:52,053
The nurse is here to
take good care of you.

515
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:53,891
200?

516
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:55,728
No, the drinks are
also very expensive here.

517
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,327
you're awesome, dude.
you got us free drinks.

518
00:30:59,538 --> 00:31:00,766
What?

519
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:12,276
This is on me, Suraj, by the way.

520
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:16,387
Wow! Suraj, you've managed
to gain a lot of influence..

521
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:18,183
..in Australia in such a short time.

522
00:31:20,325 --> 00:31:21,815
No. It's not that..

523
00:31:22,794 --> 00:31:25,024
Join me.

524
00:31:29,768 --> 00:31:33,363
If you get this girl,
I'll shave my moustache off.

525
00:31:35,774 --> 00:31:38,868
you're going to get slapped. you
have no idea how her brother is.

526
00:31:39,144 --> 00:31:44,639
you guys don't know me either.
Just wait and watch.

527
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,641
She's going to kiss me.

528
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,281
It's all part of a
well contrived plan.

529
00:31:52,324 --> 00:31:53,450
Plan.

530
00:31:53,525 --> 00:31:56,619
Plan? What plan?

531
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,329
''When she loved me, my girl.''

532
00:32:00,665 --> 00:32:05,193
''When she loved me, girl now.''

533
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:09,536
''What do I make you hear?
What do I tell you?''

534
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:14,135
''She told me through her actions.''

535
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:19,614
''Some through her looks,
some through her style.''

536
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:23,814
''Some she robbed from
the edge of her lips.''

537
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:33,957
''When I touched her, I felt high.''

538
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:38,668
''My heart started
beating when she hugged me.''

539
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:43,504
''The blood in my veins
froze when she loved me.''

540
00:32:43,575 --> 00:32:48,308
''My heart started
beating when she hugged me.''

541
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,976
''The blood in my veins
froze when she loved me.''

542
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:18,033
''She came in ethnic
wear to come see me.''

543
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:22,671
''I was sitting further away
and she came and sat next to me.''

544
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:27,682
''She kept talking and I
fell for all her talks.''

545
00:33:27,786 --> 00:33:32,485
''I don't know how I
landed up in her arms.''

546
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:41,726
''Felt like smoke
emerged from my veins.''

547
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:47,165
''My heart started
beating when she hugged me.''

548
00:33:47,272 --> 00:33:52,073
''The blood in my veins
froze when she loved me.''

549
00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:56,546
''My heart started
beating when she hugged me.''

550
00:33:56,614 --> 00:34:01,642
''The blood in my veins
froze when she loved me.''

551
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,014
''Ever since you caught my eye.''

552
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,315
''Boy, would you rule my life.''

553
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:12,360
''you know you got me
going you don't even try.''

554
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:14,659
''Ever since you caught my eye.''

555
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:16,997
''Boy, would you rule my life.''

556
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:21,802
''you know you got me
going you don't even try.''

557
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:24,238
''Don't even try.''

558
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:29,680
''you don't even try.''

559
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:34,848
''For so many years she
kept her heart protected.''

560
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:39,754
''I sneaked in and robbed her heart.''

561
00:34:39,858 --> 00:34:44,591
''I'm telling you the truth.
Don't go by the books.''

562
00:34:44,696 --> 00:34:49,133
''In the night my
thoughts didn't let her sleep.''

563
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:58,632
''The journey was
incredible and the feeling was new.''

564
00:34:59,077 --> 00:35:03,980
''My heart started
beating when she hugged me.''

565
00:35:04,048 --> 00:35:08,849
''The blood in my veins
froze when she loved me.''

566
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,653
''My heart started
beating when she hugged me.''

567
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:18,628
''The blood in my veins
froze when she loved me.''

568
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:20,254
What?

569
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,636
I was just out for a
morning walk with my friends.

570
00:35:28,173 --> 00:35:29,731
Morning walk at this time?

571
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:33,306
What a long life. We
were just talking about you.

572
00:35:33,378 --> 00:35:35,005
About you only.

573
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:36,338
It's a fact.
- It's a fact.

574
00:35:36,414 --> 00:35:38,245
It's a fact.
- Absolutely a fact.

575
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,174
Come on.
- Can I come too?

576
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:42,044
For a morning walk.
- Not you. Thank you.

577
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,480
Bye.
- Bye-bye, sister.

578
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:44,920
Stay away from him.
Let's get out of here.

579
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:47,318
Jai, you impressed her.
Impressed her?

580
00:35:47,392 --> 00:35:50,850
I knew you were lying.
Trying to act over smart.

581
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:55,195
you impressed her.
- He's a big liar!

582
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:01,132
'It's gone. Caught behind.'

583
00:36:01,206 --> 00:36:03,868
Well caught! Well caught!

584
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:11,843
Cheer up. Cheer up. you're
going to be my wife soon.

585
00:36:12,116 --> 00:36:13,515
Sorry, I hope I didn't hurt you.

586
00:36:13,585 --> 00:36:15,075
Don't you have any other work to do?

587
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:17,120
Of course, I do. In fact
I'm looking for a job.

588
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:20,219
As soon as I get one I'll
take you out for dinner.

589
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:24,854
Come on, guys. Do something.

590
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:30,097
No scholarship, come on. We
need to make our team win.

591
00:36:30,168 --> 00:36:31,726
Cheer them on with me!

592
00:36:32,704 --> 00:36:34,035
you should've got a
dance scholarship..

593
00:36:34,138 --> 00:36:35,230
..Romi Latti from Hoshiyaarpur.

594
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,902
It's Gurdaspur.
Don't distract me now.

595
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:43,775
Well done!

596
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:46,149
We won!

597
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:49,081
We won!

598
00:37:04,135 --> 00:37:05,864
We won!

599
00:37:06,104 --> 00:37:08,163
your yet-to-be-husband
is dancing a bit too much.

600
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:12,099
Come, I'll drop you home, girl.

601
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:15,772
Get out of my way!
Just get out of my way!

602
00:37:16,214 --> 00:37:19,581
What's your problem?
What are you doing?

603
00:37:19,651 --> 00:37:21,084
What's your problem?

604
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:25,019
I was just dancing. What's
the problem? Only dance.

605
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:26,454
What's so funny?

606
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:43,104
Brother, we should let this go.
We're in the minority.

607
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:48,535
One who fights many bravely
is a true follower of Sikhism.

608
00:37:59,023 --> 00:38:00,888
Avoid all trouble.
Avoid all trouble.

609
00:38:04,262 --> 00:38:05,820
Let's go, boys.

610
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:13,098
your brother turned out
to be like Genghis Khan.

611
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:15,098
Angry all the time.

612
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:17,141
Is it necessary to crack
a joke every single time?

613
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:21,708
It's the same drama with these
rascals each and every time.

614
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:25,414
They start up a fight and
then blame it on an Indian.

615
00:38:26,184 --> 00:38:30,416
I'm telling you. They are
going to do something. I know it.

616
00:38:31,322 --> 00:38:33,916
The time has come when
we all need to unite.

617
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:37,559
We have to do something.
We must do something.

618
00:38:37,662 --> 00:38:40,028
Before they enter our
house and insult our culture.

619
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:41,588
That rascal got away.

620
00:38:41,899 --> 00:38:44,493
If it wasn't for the cop, you
would've totally beaten him up.

621
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:47,694
Brother, Romi shouldn't have
danced like a monkey there

622
00:38:47,772 --> 00:38:49,239
We should also
respect their culture.

623
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,409
But I was just.. - No. No. It's
true that we Indians are no less.

624
00:38:52,644 --> 00:38:54,009
But I agree with Suhani.

625
00:38:54,078 --> 00:38:55,409
What you did was wrong Romi.

626
00:38:55,647 --> 00:38:56,807
Very bad. Very bad. Very bad.

627
00:38:57,382 --> 00:38:58,781
What wrong did Romi do?

628
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:05,884
What culture are we talking about?
What is their culture?

629
00:39:06,858 --> 00:39:08,325
Having babies without being married.

630
00:39:08,993 --> 00:39:11,223
Sleeping around carelessly.
Is this their culture?

631
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:16,828
Or the fact that their ancestors
were criminals doing their time.

632
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:19,462
They are all
descendants of criminals.

633
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:24,364
And they talk about our
ancient culture. Culture.

634
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,453
yet again the siblings have
come to receive an Indian.

635
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:51,926
Brother, you're
falling for this girl.

636
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:53,895
No. In fact, I'm trapping her.

637
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:57,232
Formula no.2. Get the
girl and get your PR.

638
00:39:57,575 --> 00:39:59,406
Just tell me how
long will this take?

639
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,946
Golde has worked on the
car not some cheap labourer.

640
00:40:03,347 --> 00:40:05,315
In exactly five minutes,
the car will stop running.

641
00:40:15,026 --> 00:40:20,054
Suhani. Samarth. What
are you guys doing here?

642
00:40:21,332 --> 00:40:22,890
Can't you see our car broke down?

643
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:26,327
you're in luck. Golde is
a mechanic. He'll fix it.

644
00:40:26,671 --> 00:40:28,468
Come on get to work,
Golde. With your hands only.

645
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:30,664
Me? yes, me.

646
00:40:32,477 --> 00:40:33,842
Looks like an electrical fault.

647
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:37,540
I just dropped some Indians
and Pakistanis to the airport.

648
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:40,381
This is going to take an hour
or two. That's a fact. - Why?

649
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:45,613
Now what?
- I need to check the whole car.

650
00:40:46,524 --> 00:40:48,014
No problem. I'll drop you.

651
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:50,627
Till then Golde can fix
the car. Right, Golde?

652
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:59,960
you go home. I'll
wait here with the car.

653
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:02,635
In any case, this
area is not so safe.

654
00:41:04,108 --> 00:41:05,769
you have your cell-phone, right?
- yes.

655
00:41:05,877 --> 00:41:07,344
Call me when you get home.

656
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:11,881
Should we get the bags?

657
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:19,613
Thank you so much for
dropping me to college.

658
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,282
No problem at all.

659
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:23,858
Someone had dropped me
off when I first came here.

660
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:27,464
But the one who dropped
me was really special.

661
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:30,433
Don't you talk a bit too much?

662
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,962
Please I'm not that bad.

663
00:41:34,672 --> 00:41:36,572
In fact, I'm much
better than your helpline.

664
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:39,476
Actually, for once in your
life I think you're right.

665
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:41,637
At least you don't bother me 24x7.

666
00:41:41,846 --> 00:41:45,145
I can do that too
if you want. 24x7.

667
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:48,886
But you need to stop hiding
under this Mother India mask.

668
00:41:49,787 --> 00:41:51,379
Sorry, what's that?

669
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,887
It doesn't suit you at all.

670
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:56,451
So what suits me exactly?

671
00:42:00,031 --> 00:42:03,467
It's time you remove
this pencil from your hair.

672
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:12,502
That's better.

673
00:42:19,317 --> 00:42:20,648
you mean on silent mode?

674
00:42:21,185 --> 00:42:23,210
Why? Will your brother be
angry if you switch it off?

675
00:42:26,224 --> 00:42:27,384
Anything else?

676
00:42:30,061 --> 00:42:31,528
And these intense lips of yours..

677
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:35,524
..should now have a
lovely and beautiful smile.

678
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:38,627
Okay, have I changed now?

679
00:42:42,506 --> 00:42:45,066
Are you guys fighting?

680
00:42:45,343 --> 00:42:47,140
Please carry on.

681
00:42:51,649 --> 00:42:52,980
Golde.

682
00:42:55,686 --> 00:42:57,051
yes, Golde.

683
00:42:57,121 --> 00:42:58,520
Dude, I messed up.

684
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:04,286
I got overexcited and ruined
the entire wiring of this car.

685
00:43:04,395 --> 00:43:06,192
Now this car cannot be fixed.

686
00:43:06,464 --> 00:43:12,699
How much more time? Five minutes?

687
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,901
Five minutes?

688
00:43:18,676 --> 00:43:20,610
It will take five hours
at least. That's a fact.

689
00:43:20,711 --> 00:43:22,269
No there's no need
for you to come here.

690
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,573
Do me a favour and
take Samarth home.

691
00:43:24,682 --> 00:43:28,448
Make sure he has a cold drink,
since he's always so hot headed.

692
00:43:29,186 --> 00:43:30,847
And listen don't
take any money from him.

693
00:43:30,955 --> 00:43:32,388
I'll make him eat lunch
if you want.

694
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:34,615
you know he's family.
- I'll take money from you.

695
00:43:34,692 --> 00:43:35,784
How long do I handle this?

696
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,986
Okay bye.
- Hello?

697
00:43:40,898 --> 00:43:43,560
There are two ways to
attain your PR here.

698
00:43:43,868 --> 00:43:47,304
The first being the long route.
Give money to the agencies money..

699
00:43:47,538 --> 00:43:49,199
..and you'll get a work
experience certificate.

700
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:50,399
And the second?

701
00:43:50,508 --> 00:43:52,135
The second way..

702
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:55,244
Suhani.

703
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:57,007
Romi, what are you doing here?

704
00:43:57,114 --> 00:44:00,208
Second way.
- I'll tell you later

705
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:03,845
yes, I got this job yesterday.
In fact, Samarth helped me get it.

706
00:44:04,388 --> 00:44:06,447
Nice. Congrats.

707
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:17,124
I was thinking that since I got
a job now you and me.. dinner?

708
00:44:18,102 --> 00:44:19,729
Dinner?

709
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:25,107
Well, I'm a bit busy today.

710
00:44:25,176 --> 00:44:28,577
But we'll plan it. Let's
do it. How much for this?

711
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,206
$5 AUS.

712
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:31,543
The second way?

713
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,014
Later.

714
00:44:33,384 --> 00:44:36,217
Let it be. I'll take care of it.

715
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:39,313
No, that's fine.
Thank you so much. Bye.

716
00:44:40,391 --> 00:44:41,858
The second way?

717
00:44:41,926 --> 00:44:43,689
Stop repeating the same
thing again and again.

718
00:44:43,928 --> 00:44:45,657
Go wait in the car.
I'm coming. Go on. - yes.

719
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:53,200
Romi Latti from Gurdaspur.

720
00:44:53,304 --> 00:44:56,273
Hoshiyaarpur. He got
it right this time.

721
00:44:56,607 --> 00:44:58,199
Why are you so upset?

722
00:44:58,642 --> 00:45:01,611
Suhani forgot to take her change.

723
00:45:02,013 --> 00:45:06,006
Don't take it to your heart.
Actually she's really sad today.

724
00:45:06,117 --> 00:45:07,641
Why? What happened?

725
00:45:07,718 --> 00:45:10,846
Well, Samarth's car
broke down on the highway.

726
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:12,479
Can I take this?
- yes.

727
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,659
And there's no one to help.
Can I take this as well? - yes.

728
00:45:15,726 --> 00:45:17,421
I wish there was
someone who could help him.

729
00:45:17,628 --> 00:45:18,890
I can help. I can help.

730
00:45:20,331 --> 00:45:23,198
yes, I completely forgot.
Go. Go help him.

731
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,097
Suhani will be very happy.

732
00:45:25,169 --> 00:45:26,659
Shall I take this?
- yes.

733
00:45:27,104 --> 00:45:28,196
And this?
- yes.

734
00:45:28,305 --> 00:45:29,363
Okay bye.

735
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,103
That's $10 AUS.
Billu, handle the counter.

736
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:41,241
Can we go?

737
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:50,083
Suhani, to hell with
those who don't value us!

738
00:45:50,294 --> 00:45:52,592
Don't worry I'm going.

739
00:45:58,636 --> 00:46:00,035
Poor chap!

740
00:46:00,137 --> 00:46:01,764
He's gone mad. you
turned him down for dinner.

741
00:46:03,808 --> 00:46:04,900
Nice boy.

742
00:46:05,943 --> 00:46:08,173
your car is ready,
sir. Top notch quality.

743
00:46:09,246 --> 00:46:10,645
Oh, no! Where's the
smoke coming from?

744
00:46:10,848 --> 00:46:14,875
No! No! The engine might
have a problem. I'll just check.

745
00:46:14,985 --> 00:46:17,613
Just a second. Where are you going?
Wait for two minutes.

746
00:46:17,688 --> 00:46:21,954
Have patience. Wait a second.
I'll fix it.

747
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:25,524
Brother, you didn't
tell me the second way?

748
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:28,064
Later. I'll call you.
- Okay fine.

749
00:46:28,365 --> 00:46:30,458
What? What was he asking you?

750
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:31,592
Nothing.

751
00:46:31,702 --> 00:46:33,363
He was saying something, right?

752
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:36,170
Why do you over react
on every single thing?

753
00:46:37,975 --> 00:46:40,136
And speaking of over reacting,
want to go watch a film?

754
00:46:40,344 --> 00:46:43,370
There's a drive in close
by that plays Hindi films.

755
00:46:43,614 --> 00:46:46,048
you want me to go
for a movie with you?

756
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,741
Look, I know you're not allowed.

757
00:46:48,919 --> 00:46:51,149
And if your brother finds out..

758
00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:52,888
Shut up.

759
00:46:53,157 --> 00:46:55,387
If we compare our favours..

760
00:46:55,493 --> 00:46:57,051
..then that day you
picked me up from the airport.

761
00:46:57,128 --> 00:46:58,561
I'm dropping you today.

762
00:46:59,063 --> 00:47:00,121
So..

763
00:47:00,197 --> 00:47:01,494
So we are even.

764
00:47:01,565 --> 00:47:04,033
No, but you also didn't
rat me out to your brother.

765
00:47:04,268 --> 00:47:06,361
So a movie for that?
What's the logic?

766
00:47:08,072 --> 00:47:10,404
Please. Please. Please.

767
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:13,102
Please. Please. Please.

768
00:47:16,113 --> 00:47:17,740
Please. Please. Please.

769
00:47:17,815 --> 00:47:19,749
Stop it. What are
you doing? Stop it.

770
00:47:19,817 --> 00:47:20,909
Please. Please. Please.

771
00:47:21,185 --> 00:47:22,243
Film please.

772
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:23,411
Get up!

773
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:24,986
Please. Please.

774
00:47:25,055 --> 00:47:26,613
Okay fine. Which film is it?

775
00:47:38,102 --> 00:47:40,002
Oh my God!

776
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:44,105
Heat it up a little more.

777
00:47:54,752 --> 00:48:00,088
''I'm living without myself.''

778
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:05,595
''I'm swaying in your aura.''

779
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:11,632
''I don't know how I became yours.''

780
00:48:12,536 --> 00:48:18,805
''I think I'm what
your heart prayed for.''

781
00:48:27,918 --> 00:48:38,294
''I started living
since I found you.''

782
00:48:38,896 --> 00:48:45,267
''I hope this moment
lasts forever between us.''

783
00:48:45,336 --> 00:48:55,644
''I started living
since I found you.''

784
00:48:56,013 --> 00:49:02,885
''I hope this moment
lasts forever between us.''

785
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:18,663
''I'm living more than I used.''

786
00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:24,564
''Ever since our
hearts have connected.''

787
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:29,835
''I'm walking on your path.''

788
00:49:30,781 --> 00:49:36,686
''you're my destination
and I'm at your feet.''

789
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:47,155
''I started living
since I found you.''

790
00:49:47,965 --> 00:49:54,529
''I hope this moment
lasts forever between us.''

791
00:49:54,605 --> 00:50:04,742
''I started living
since I found you.''

792
00:50:05,149 --> 00:50:12,248
''I hope this moment
lasts forever between us.''

793
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:39,511
''your looks have a new style
and you give a different high.''

794
00:50:40,718 --> 00:50:51,060
''After so many days you
have finally opened up to me.''

795
00:50:51,462 --> 00:50:56,297
''My actions lie within your limits.''

796
00:50:57,167 --> 00:51:02,503
''Now where do you have to go?''

797
00:51:02,773 --> 00:51:07,938
''Where you stay I am that world.''

798
00:51:08,412 --> 00:51:13,714
''What you live I am that moment.''

799
00:51:14,184 --> 00:51:19,554
''I am a new person because of you.''

800
00:51:20,424 --> 00:51:27,023
''I never said it before, but
am saying this to you now.''

801
00:51:28,098 --> 00:51:38,303
''I started living
since I found you.''

802
00:51:38,776 --> 00:51:45,579
''I hope this moment
lasts forever between us.''

803
00:51:45,649 --> 00:51:55,547
''I started living
since I found you.''

804
00:51:56,059 --> 00:52:03,522
''I hope this moment
lasts forever between us.''

805
00:52:08,939 --> 00:52:11,499
I know you would have
enjoyed yourself at dinner..

806
00:52:11,575 --> 00:52:13,304
..with Romi Latti from Hoshiyaarpur.

807
00:52:13,377 --> 00:52:14,537
It's Gurdaspur.

808
00:52:14,778 --> 00:52:17,804
Whatever it is. your
yet-to-be complete man.

809
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:20,213
Don't be mean. He's not that bad.

810
00:52:21,218 --> 00:52:23,846
And if you look at it,
he's very intelligent.

811
00:52:23,954 --> 00:52:27,219
He's here on scholarship. He's
from the same village as I am.

812
00:52:28,091 --> 00:52:31,185
He's always honest and
my brother likes him too.

813
00:52:34,131 --> 00:52:35,621
And who do you like?

814
00:52:38,035 --> 00:52:40,595
you know if it were
up to your brother..

815
00:52:41,205 --> 00:52:43,173
..he would ban you from smiling.

816
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:47,037
No, he was not always like that.
After my sister's death..

817
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:49,139
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to..

818
00:52:49,213 --> 00:52:50,339
No, that's okay.

819
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:54,009
After my sister's death, he
just became overprotective.

820
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,614
I see that's why I
never get an opportunity.

821
00:53:00,357 --> 00:53:01,688
Opportunity?

822
00:53:05,696 --> 00:53:07,721
If you had one, what would you do?

823
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:12,061
Come close to you.

824
00:53:24,114 --> 00:53:25,479
Then come.

825
00:53:36,326 --> 00:53:37,850
And?

826
00:53:39,463 --> 00:53:41,328
And I would hold your hand.

827
00:53:45,669 --> 00:53:46,966
And?

828
00:53:50,474 --> 00:53:51,873
And exactly what you're thinking.

829
00:53:53,477 --> 00:53:55,104
What am I thinking?

830
00:53:57,548 --> 00:53:59,038
What I can't say.

831
00:53:59,516 --> 00:54:10,154
''I started living
since I found you.''

832
00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:16,695
''I hope this moment
lasts forever between us.''

833
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:21,761
''I started living
since I found you.''

834
00:54:51,134 --> 00:54:53,762
Brother? Brother, this blood..
Are you okay? - Don't.

835
00:54:59,776 --> 00:55:01,403
What were you guys doing?

836
00:55:04,014 --> 00:55:05,641
Where were you?

837
00:55:06,717 --> 00:55:08,651
I went.. I went to see a film

838
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:10,311
A film?

839
00:55:12,489 --> 00:55:13,820
That's why you sent
Romi to the highway..

840
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:15,323
..so that you could go with him..

841
00:55:15,859 --> 00:55:17,121
Romi?

842
00:55:21,465 --> 00:55:23,330
Romi was mugged on the highway.

843
00:55:25,268 --> 00:55:27,327
Here we are getting
attacked by Australians..

844
00:55:27,404 --> 00:55:29,565
..and you went to watch a film?

845
00:55:30,907 --> 00:55:32,636
you should have seen his condition.

846
00:55:34,578 --> 00:55:36,239
I took him to the hospital alone.

847
00:55:37,648 --> 00:55:40,549
Had I not reached on time,
he would've been dead.

848
00:55:40,884 --> 00:55:43,853
I kept calling you for help,
but your phone..

849
00:55:45,822 --> 00:55:49,588
All because of you.
All because of you.

850
00:55:49,926 --> 00:55:54,556
Samarth, it's not Suhani's fault.
Actually, we were..

851
00:55:55,632 --> 00:55:57,896
Did I ask you anything?

852
00:56:00,003 --> 00:56:02,471
If I ever see you near her again..

853
00:56:03,106 --> 00:56:05,199
..I'll break your legs.

854
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:08,443
Come on.

855
00:56:34,037 --> 00:56:35,368
'Show. Show. Show.'

856
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:37,737
'Wait.
- Please show. Show it. Not fair.'

857
00:56:37,808 --> 00:56:40,038
'Okay. Sheena, come on, smile.'

858
00:56:40,944 --> 00:56:42,844
'I don't look nice here.'

859
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:58,260
'Smile.'

860
00:56:59,096 --> 00:57:00,825
'Brother's never
going to understand.'

861
00:57:01,231 --> 00:57:04,359
'Just chill. What's wrong with you?'

862
00:57:04,968 --> 00:57:07,732
I think if it's a boy
he'll be a football player.

863
00:57:07,804 --> 00:57:10,466
'And if it's a girl
then an astronaut.'

864
00:57:10,974 --> 00:57:12,305
'Sheena '

865
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:16,573
'Chill. I'll convince him.
He loves me a lot.'

866
00:57:19,182 --> 00:57:20,308
'Who is this man for whom
you're turning your..

867
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:21,509
..back on your family for!'

868
00:57:21,618 --> 00:57:23,677
'Brother, I love him.
I love him, Brother.'

869
00:57:23,787 --> 00:57:25,448
'What will our
community think, Sheena?'

870
00:57:25,522 --> 00:57:29,356
'I want to live with him.
He loves me.'

871
00:57:33,263 --> 00:57:37,996
Big plans you had of kissing her.
you got slapped instead.

872
00:57:38,268 --> 00:57:41,362
But why didn't you retaliate? you
should've given him 2-3 slaps back.

873
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:44,130
you have to do these things for PR.

874
00:57:44,775 --> 00:57:47,039
Besides it was her older
brother so I couldn't say anything.

875
00:57:47,978 --> 00:57:49,240
you big shot Ferrari owner!

876
00:57:49,346 --> 00:57:50,779
Easy. Easy. Be careful. Be careful.

877
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,576
you will fall down.
- you are telling me to be careful!

878
00:57:52,649 --> 00:57:53,843
Be careful.

879
00:57:53,917 --> 00:57:59,446
We Punjabis talk loudly.
We don't fall down.

880
00:57:59,523 --> 00:58:00,922
Oh no.

881
00:58:02,692 --> 00:58:04,990
Get up. Get up.

882
00:58:05,662 --> 00:58:09,564
And if we do fall,
we fall with pride.

883
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:11,960
Okay. Okay.
- Got it? - Come here.

884
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:13,695
Listen to me. Listen to me.

885
00:58:20,177 --> 00:58:22,441
Tell me one thing.

886
00:58:23,313 --> 00:58:25,042
What's Samarth's problem?

887
00:58:25,816 --> 00:58:28,182
Why can't he let
Suhani live her life?

888
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:34,080
Listen to me. Their entire
family is crack. That's a fact.

889
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:39,891
What exactly are you? And
what did you just address me as?

890
00:58:40,297 --> 00:58:41,787
Hey, boys.

891
00:58:44,668 --> 00:58:46,067
you need a ride?

892
00:58:49,539 --> 00:58:52,702
Hey, Formula No. 2.

893
00:58:53,643 --> 00:58:55,133
Hop in.

894
00:58:55,745 --> 00:58:58,839
yes, we're coming in your car.

895
00:59:00,851 --> 00:59:02,580
We are going to Jalandhar.

896
00:59:03,053 --> 00:59:04,884
Walk into our house.

897
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:12,322
Till today.. till today nothing
like this has ever happened with me.

898
00:59:12,729 --> 00:59:14,560
Forget it.

899
00:59:17,534 --> 00:59:19,468
Tomorrow I'm going to hold her
hand in front of her brother.

900
00:59:19,536 --> 00:59:20,730
That's a fact.

901
00:59:21,004 --> 00:59:25,304
Are you some kind of broken record?
Look at this woman.

902
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:26,808
She's right here.

903
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:31,711
Listen to me, she has an Australian
passport just like Suhani.

904
00:59:32,015 --> 00:59:35,849
you just want your PR, right?
So let her be.

905
00:59:36,286 --> 00:59:39,050
Cheers to your love.

906
00:59:46,229 --> 00:59:48,493
Cheers to your PR.

907
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,960
Cheers to both of us.

908
01:01:03,974 --> 01:01:05,942
you've seen me in lesser,
haven't you?

909
01:01:07,577 --> 01:01:08,874
I have?

910
01:01:10,213 --> 01:01:11,475
Coffee?

911
01:01:24,594 --> 01:01:26,425
So..
- So?

912
01:01:30,367 --> 01:01:31,766
Last night?

913
01:01:33,169 --> 01:01:36,138
Oh, you and your friend fell
asleep in the back of my car.

914
01:01:36,873 --> 01:01:40,172
He jumped out of the car
screaming some Formula No. 2.

915
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:43,401
I didn't know where to
take you so I got you here.

916
01:01:43,513 --> 01:01:44,605
Okay.

917
01:01:46,383 --> 01:01:48,874
And..
- And?

918
01:01:53,857 --> 01:01:54,949
Something happened?

919
01:01:55,058 --> 01:01:57,549
Don't worry. you're still a virgin.

920
01:01:59,429 --> 01:02:00,589
I'm not a virgin.

921
01:02:00,663 --> 01:02:02,392
So you're a player then?

922
01:02:03,066 --> 01:02:07,127
No. I'm.. It's just that
I'm not that kind of guy.

923
01:02:07,537 --> 01:02:09,437
Okay, Mr. Not-That-Kind-Of-Guy..

924
01:02:10,173 --> 01:02:13,233
..you're not as much of a player
as you make yourself out to be.

925
01:02:13,543 --> 01:02:15,272
you're not as bad as you think.

926
01:02:27,457 --> 01:02:28,924
Hello.

927
01:02:35,965 --> 01:02:37,432
Hurry up.

928
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,297
Let's go. Hurry up.

929
01:02:39,369 --> 01:02:40,768
Let's go. Let's go.
- Hurry up.

930
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:42,132
Hurry up. Hurry up.

931
01:02:42,305 --> 01:02:43,772
Keep moving. Hurry up.

932
01:02:43,873 --> 01:02:44,931
yes Golde, tell me.

933
01:02:45,008 --> 01:02:47,169
Where are you? Do you
know that Jolly's gone?

934
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:48,736
What does that mean?

935
01:02:48,812 --> 01:02:50,803
Samarth has held a protest in
front of the police station.

936
01:02:50,914 --> 01:02:53,610
Jolly landed up there to participate
and the police caught him..

937
01:02:53,683 --> 01:02:55,514
..and found his illegal papers.

938
01:02:55,618 --> 01:02:57,108
Now if he stays here
we'll all get caught.

939
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:58,778
He has to go back
to his native place.

940
01:02:58,855 --> 01:02:59,981
Where do you think you're going?

941
01:03:00,056 --> 01:03:01,045
Police arrested Jolly.

942
01:03:01,157 --> 01:03:02,419
Go back. I'll slap you.
Go back into the house.

943
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:03,789
Do you also want to
get arrested like Jolly?

944
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,088
But Jolly, my brother..

945
01:03:05,195 --> 01:03:06,423
Suraj, listen to me you
make sure you don't go there.

946
01:03:06,629 --> 01:03:07,687
you shouldn't go there.

947
01:03:07,797 --> 01:03:10,527
This is not our fight and we're
not going to get into this mess.

948
01:03:10,633 --> 01:03:11,793
Think about your PR.

949
01:03:11,868 --> 01:03:12,926
Get out of there and
come home immediately.

950
01:03:13,036 --> 01:03:14,128
'The traffic at Church Square is
disrupted as hoards of Indian..'

951
01:03:14,237 --> 01:03:15,465
'..immigrants have poured in
huge numbers to protest against..'

952
01:03:15,538 --> 01:03:16,903
'..the recent attack on
another Indian student.'

953
01:03:17,107 --> 01:03:18,665
'The Indian Channels
have been playing..'

954
01:03:18,741 --> 01:03:20,800
'..the news of this attack
calling it a racial attack.'

955
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:24,502
We want justice.

956
01:03:24,714 --> 01:03:30,277
We want justice. We want justice.

957
01:03:30,386 --> 01:03:34,049
We want justice. We want justice.

958
01:03:34,124 --> 01:03:37,685
We want justice. We want justice.

959
01:03:37,994 --> 01:03:39,985
We want justice. We want justice.

960
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:48,563
My name is Romi
Latti from Gurdaspur.

961
01:03:51,107 --> 01:03:54,907
I'm a student just
like all of you..

962
01:03:57,347 --> 01:03:59,212
..who has come to Melbourne,
Australia..

963
01:04:00,016 --> 01:04:02,644
..for a better life.

964
01:04:07,557 --> 01:04:13,928
Last night a few
Australian boys dragged me..

965
01:04:14,898 --> 01:04:20,359
..out of my tow truck and hit me.

966
01:04:21,437 --> 01:04:27,433
They dragged me through the concrete
of the highway and hit me again.

967
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:35,609
At first I thought they
were just robbing me..

968
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:43,349
..but I realised later that
I was just being punished..

969
01:04:43,459 --> 01:04:44,926
..because of my colour.

970
01:04:48,831 --> 01:04:50,992
Because I'm an Indian.

971
01:04:57,774 --> 01:05:01,210
I'm sure there are
people here today who have..

972
01:05:01,311 --> 01:05:02,903
..witnessed the same brutality.

973
01:05:03,146 --> 01:05:09,016
'Please, Brother. I don't
want to die. Please, Brother.'

974
01:05:09,686 --> 01:05:14,123
I want to go back home but what will
I tell my family when I go back?

975
01:05:14,357 --> 01:05:16,154
I came back a loser, defeated?

976
01:05:16,259 --> 01:05:18,159
Brother, please!

977
01:05:19,829 --> 01:05:22,389
'Sheena!'

978
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:28,728
Not just me, no one standing
here would like to go back home.

979
01:05:28,805 --> 01:05:30,773
Justice.

980
01:05:31,007 --> 01:05:35,068
I can't change what
happened to me but..

981
01:05:36,212 --> 01:05:38,578
..this cannot
happen with anyone else.

982
01:05:41,317 --> 01:05:44,252
With Samarth's help I'm pleading
to the Victorian police to come

983
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,254
..here and assure the
safety of Indian student..

984
01:05:46,322 --> 01:05:47,550
What are these guys doing here?

985
01:05:47,657 --> 01:05:49,955
Brother, I've called them.

986
01:05:50,493 --> 01:05:53,326
David and his friends
have come to support us.

987
01:05:53,529 --> 01:05:54,621
Till they..

988
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:56,722
Suhani don't you remember
what they have done to us?

989
01:06:03,906 --> 01:06:05,498
Brother..

990
01:06:09,646 --> 01:06:11,705
Arrest him.

991
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:13,544
you..

992
01:06:17,487 --> 01:06:19,580
Officer..

993
01:06:46,049 --> 01:06:47,175
Brother..

994
01:07:12,426 --> 01:07:13,859
Why did you go there?

995
01:07:14,362 --> 01:07:18,162
I told you to stay
away from the police.

996
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:20,697
But you seem to have
ants in your pants.

997
01:07:29,076 --> 01:07:30,304
Now here, keep this money..

998
01:07:30,811 --> 01:07:32,938
Brother, you have
already done so much for me.

999
01:07:33,047 --> 01:07:34,639
How will I repay you?

1000
01:07:34,715 --> 01:07:36,376
Now you're going to start
teaching me about money?

1001
01:07:36,484 --> 01:07:39,180
Will you go
empty-handed to your mother?

1002
01:07:39,453 --> 01:07:41,011
My reputation is at stake here.

1003
01:07:42,356 --> 01:07:45,484
Don't worry. Golde
knows how to get his money.

1004
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,952
I'll make sure I get it from
all these boys. That's a fact.

1005
01:07:50,231 --> 01:07:51,357
Now stop crying like a girl.

1006
01:07:51,432 --> 01:07:52,490
you're crying too.

1007
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:57,037
Forget it now well throw you a
farewell party, Punjabi style.

1008
01:07:57,805 --> 01:08:00,399
We must show these Australians.
It's a fact. Right?

1009
01:08:00,474 --> 01:08:02,465
Suraj, there's someone for you.

1010
01:08:10,518 --> 01:08:14,318
Why didn't you wait, Suraj? Why?

1011
01:08:16,157 --> 01:08:19,058
Whatever happened today
should not have happened.

1012
01:08:20,328 --> 01:08:24,196
I still believe that till
Australians and Indians..

1013
01:08:24,265 --> 01:08:30,033
..do not help each other, understand
each others problems and cultures..

1014
01:08:30,104 --> 01:08:31,935
..there will be no
solution to this issue.

1015
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:34,667
My brother should not
have hit David today.

1016
01:08:40,281 --> 01:08:43,739
But keeping mum about it also
is not going to resolve this.

1017
01:08:48,155 --> 01:08:50,123
Sometimes it's
better to keep mum Suhani.

1018
01:08:54,895 --> 01:08:56,226
I had a friend, Jai.

1019
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:04,895
His father was
involved with the underworld.

1020
01:09:09,243 --> 01:09:11,040
Threatening people and
scaring them. Smuggling.

1021
01:09:13,647 --> 01:09:15,046
A few months back there
were blasts in the city..

1022
01:09:15,116 --> 01:09:16,344
..which killed a number of people.

1023
01:09:17,752 --> 01:09:19,413
'These blasts killed many people..'

1024
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,511
'..and changed the lives
of a number of people.'

1025
01:09:21,589 --> 01:09:24,285
'Papa, bang-bang.'

1026
01:09:24,358 --> 01:09:28,795
'109 people have died and more
than 700 have been injured.'

1027
01:09:28,863 --> 01:09:31,058
When Jai's father found
out that the blast occurred..

1028
01:09:31,165 --> 01:09:33,065
..with the help of the
RDX he smuggled in..

1029
01:09:35,903 --> 01:09:38,428
..he decided to go
confess to the police.

1030
01:09:40,674 --> 01:09:44,405
He had a friend Sub-inspector
Joseph Pinto in the police force.

1031
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:49,843
'How? - Joseph, that RDX
landed at my port. Joseph..'

1032
01:09:49,917 --> 01:09:52,579
He told the commissioner everything
when Joseph made him understand.

1033
01:09:58,793 --> 01:10:00,988
'Stay right here with the uncle,
Son. I will be right back.'

1034
01:10:10,571 --> 01:10:13,904
'Hello, sir. I made a mistake, sir.'

1035
01:10:15,876 --> 01:10:17,901
To get a medal the commissioner..

1036
01:10:20,314 --> 01:10:21,645
Did what for his medal?

1037
01:10:42,503 --> 01:10:44,494
If he would've kept mum, he
would have been alive today.

1038
01:10:47,741 --> 01:10:52,337
Joseph too never complained
and Jai was left all alone.

1039
01:10:55,883 --> 01:10:57,510
Suhani, I decided from that day on..

1040
01:10:59,753 --> 01:11:01,243
I'm not looking for any solution.

1041
01:11:01,489 --> 01:11:02,922
This isn't my problem.

1042
01:11:03,858 --> 01:11:06,190
I don't want to get involved
in this Indian-Australian issue.

1043
01:11:11,665 --> 01:11:16,659
you know Suraj, Jai's
father's life was not wasted.

1044
01:11:18,706 --> 01:11:20,799
He took a stand for a good cause.

1045
01:11:21,775 --> 01:11:23,675
At some point in life
you have to take a stand.

1046
01:11:24,211 --> 01:11:30,150
you know the world will not
be destroyed by one bad man..

1047
01:11:30,251 --> 01:11:32,947
..but by the silence
of a thousand good men.

1048
01:11:33,754 --> 01:11:36,279
you need to help.
you need to help me.

1049
01:11:36,824 --> 01:11:38,382
Help you for what, Suhani?

1050
01:11:40,261 --> 01:11:42,354
It's so easy for you to say this
because you're from Australia.

1051
01:11:43,464 --> 01:11:47,662
Till I don't get my PR I have
certain limitations. Got it?

1052
01:11:49,203 --> 01:11:51,467
And what stand are
you talking about?

1053
01:11:51,839 --> 01:11:53,898
you're going to marry Romi..

1054
01:11:54,008 --> 01:11:55,532
..because your brother
finds it appropriate.

1055
01:11:55,643 --> 01:11:57,508
you can't take a stand
in front of your brother.

1056
01:11:58,379 --> 01:11:59,971
Before taking a stand
for the whole world..

1057
01:12:00,047 --> 01:12:02,038
.. take a stand in front
of your brother, Suhani.

1058
01:12:04,184 --> 01:12:06,311
Please leave me out of this. Okay?

1059
01:12:12,626 --> 01:12:13,888
you're right.

1060
01:12:19,633 --> 01:12:22,727
If you're not with me,
you're against me.

1061
01:12:29,944 --> 01:12:37,248
''A dude came from India.''

1062
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:44,354
''A dude came from India.''

1063
01:12:44,425 --> 01:12:46,359
Well done.

1064
01:12:46,427 --> 01:12:47,792
Well done.

1065
01:12:47,861 --> 01:12:52,560
''A dude came from India.''

1066
01:12:56,403 --> 01:12:58,371
''A dude came from India.''

1067
01:12:58,439 --> 01:13:00,771
''He started to work there.''

1068
01:13:00,841 --> 01:13:03,173
''Money attracts the heart.''

1069
01:13:03,243 --> 01:13:05,609
''So he drives the
taxi day and night..''

1070
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:09,479
''..and earns a lot of dollars.''

1071
01:13:22,296 --> 01:13:24,127
''Oh.''

1072
01:13:28,769 --> 01:13:30,828
''He has left his job there..''

1073
01:13:30,938 --> 01:13:33,202
''..and started falling in love.''

1074
01:13:33,273 --> 01:13:35,605
''His eyes met someone.''

1075
01:13:35,676 --> 01:13:38,042
''He liked someone..''

1076
01:13:38,545 --> 01:13:43,107
''..and became obsessed with love.''

1077
01:14:07,808 --> 01:14:10,072
''My friends have this rule..''

1078
01:14:10,177 --> 01:14:12,475
''To give your
heart away is useless.''

1079
01:14:12,579 --> 01:14:14,410
''Romeos have died falling in love.''

1080
01:14:14,481 --> 01:14:17,075
''So I hope you don't die.''

1081
01:14:17,451 --> 01:14:19,851
''Leave all your
troubles and don't worry.''

1082
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,252
''Just flirt, don't be committed.''

1083
01:14:22,322 --> 01:14:24,051
''Heed my advice.''

1084
01:14:24,124 --> 01:14:26,149
''Don't make any promises in love.''

1085
01:14:26,226 --> 01:14:28,387
''He is enjoying himself.''

1086
01:14:28,495 --> 01:14:30,793
''He is seeing Australian women.''

1087
01:14:30,898 --> 01:14:33,264
''In her eyes he
found a high like wine.''

1088
01:14:33,367 --> 01:14:41,069
''He is now getting drunk
and enjoying himself.''

1089
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:02,686
''Dude, don't fight the passion.''

1090
01:15:02,763 --> 01:15:05,095
''Mate, get to the action.''

1091
01:15:05,165 --> 01:15:08,828
''Play, a little touch
alone with the lady.''

1092
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:13,667
''Feel the song, Baby,
get it on, get it right.''

1093
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:32,722
Good going. Enjoy yourself.

1094
01:15:38,866 --> 01:15:40,424
He kissed her.

1095
01:15:40,534 --> 01:15:42,195
He went for it.

1096
01:15:43,837 --> 01:15:45,964
''Tell me what you
thinking about tonight.''

1097
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:48,439
''I want to do everything.
I want to do it right.''

1098
01:15:48,642 --> 01:15:50,872
''May be, I can help
you free your mind.''

1099
01:15:50,978 --> 01:15:53,344
''Open the door you and let
me in, I can check upon it.''

1100
01:15:53,447 --> 01:15:55,813
''Let go me, I will
ever take an initiate.''

1101
01:15:55,883 --> 01:15:58,317
''Proximity is the key,
don't you hesitate.''

1102
01:15:58,552 --> 01:16:00,486
''Give in to the
feeling that leads the way.''

1103
01:16:00,554 --> 01:16:02,283
''We are going to..
we going to get it.''

1104
01:16:02,356 --> 01:16:04,483
''If you're not there,
there's no problem.''

1105
01:16:04,558 --> 01:16:06,788
''There are other women..''

1106
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:11,354
''..who have caught my eye.''

1107
01:16:12,099 --> 01:16:16,559
''If you want to go, go,
I don't care.''

1108
01:16:48,502 --> 01:16:49,799
I love you.

1109
01:16:55,442 --> 01:16:56,636
Me too.

1110
01:16:57,511 --> 01:17:00,537
you love Suhani, don't you?

1111
01:17:02,716 --> 01:17:03,842
No, I don't.

1112
01:17:04,551 --> 01:17:06,712
Then what did you go
to the protest for?

1113
01:17:08,956 --> 01:17:10,150
How do you know that?

1114
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:13,115
I know things.

1115
01:17:14,561 --> 01:17:16,358
I mean I went there for a bit but..

1116
01:17:17,631 --> 01:17:18,893
How do you know that?

1117
01:17:20,033 --> 01:17:21,466
Someone told me.

1118
01:17:23,237 --> 01:17:24,568
May I ask who?

1119
01:17:25,505 --> 01:17:27,871
Same people who attacked
that guy on the highway.

1120
01:17:28,475 --> 01:17:31,467
Same people who would have had you
fixed if you had helped her brother.

1121
01:17:33,647 --> 01:17:35,911
They're going to get Samarth
when he comes out of prison.

1122
01:17:38,352 --> 01:17:41,753
But don't worry,
they won't harm you now.

1123
01:17:44,825 --> 01:17:46,156
you're with me.

1124
01:18:08,048 --> 01:18:11,950
Get ready. His car is
in the subway car park.

1125
01:18:12,953 --> 01:18:14,921
And you're friend is checking out.

1126
01:18:15,355 --> 01:18:16,879
I owe you one, boss.

1127
01:18:46,653 --> 01:18:49,417
Get off me. Get off me.

1128
01:18:58,665 --> 01:18:59,757
Get off me.

1129
01:19:00,434 --> 01:19:01,594
Get off me.

1130
01:19:12,245 --> 01:19:13,712
Get off me. Get off me.

1131
01:19:14,314 --> 01:19:15,645
Let's go.

1132
01:19:16,717 --> 01:19:18,082
Oh no.

1133
01:19:46,346 --> 01:19:47,973
'See no evil, hear no evil, man.'

1134
01:19:56,656 --> 01:19:57,850
I need some help here.

1135
01:19:57,958 --> 01:19:59,425
Come on!
- yes, sir.

1136
01:19:59,526 --> 01:20:01,926
Quick. Quick.
- Hurry up.

1137
01:20:02,396 --> 01:20:03,522
Will he be okay?

1138
01:20:03,597 --> 01:20:05,030
Take him to the doctor.
- Will he be okay?

1139
01:20:05,766 --> 01:20:07,324
Will he be okay?
- yes, yes, sir.

1140
01:20:07,401 --> 01:20:08,527
He's going to be okay. We're
going to take care of him.

1141
01:20:08,602 --> 01:20:10,593
I'm just going there
to see if he's okay.

1142
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:12,228
I'm just.. I'm just going..
- He's going to be okay.

1143
01:20:12,305 --> 01:20:13,966
Okay. Alright. Alright.
- Alright?

1144
01:21:07,694 --> 01:21:09,753
'Violent attacks on Indians
in Sidney and Melbourne..'

1145
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:12,390
'..are becoming a serious
diplomatic issue for Australia.'

1146
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:14,156
'The Indian
government is demanding..

1147
01:21:14,234 --> 01:21:16,634
'..the authorities here to
make a move to stop the attacks.'

1148
01:21:16,736 --> 01:21:19,796
'There's been relentless coverage
of the story by the Indian media.'

1149
01:21:19,873 --> 01:21:22,171
'They are calling the
attacks to be racist in nature.'

1150
01:21:25,812 --> 01:21:27,040
That's our guy.

1151
01:21:28,615 --> 01:21:29,912
Can you run that again?

1152
01:21:33,019 --> 01:21:34,111
Zoom in.

1153
01:21:37,491 --> 01:21:41,621
There's our witness. Get me
details on him. Call them in.

1154
01:21:51,304 --> 01:21:53,272
Hands up. Hands up. Hands up.

1155
01:21:54,541 --> 01:21:56,236
Russ.
- you are under arrest.

1156
01:21:56,309 --> 01:21:57,867
Come on, head down.

1157
01:22:02,482 --> 01:22:05,451
Who did you tell? Nicole, answer me.

1158
01:22:05,519 --> 01:22:08,386
One of your curry munching
friends lands up on my turf.

1159
01:22:08,655 --> 01:22:11,249
Mel gets arrested. Who's this guy?

1160
01:22:11,324 --> 01:22:12,882
Are you sleeping with him?

1161
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,489
you did, didn't you? you..

1162
01:22:16,396 --> 01:22:17,522
Jesus.

1163
01:22:18,965 --> 01:22:20,398
Oh no.

1164
01:22:26,173 --> 01:22:30,075
Comas generally last a
few days to a few weeks.

1165
01:22:30,277 --> 01:22:33,337
I mean your brother could
come out of the coma tomorrow..

1166
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,545
.. or it could take 20 years.

1167
01:22:35,649 --> 01:22:38,982
Even after recovering
he may face physical..

1168
01:22:39,085 --> 01:22:42,213
..intellectual and psychological
difficulties that..

1169
01:22:42,322 --> 01:22:44,222
..need special attention.

1170
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:49,626
We have a special unit which looks
after patients suffering from comas.

1171
01:22:49,863 --> 01:22:52,229
Go up to the fourth floor I've
spoken to Dr. Philip.

1172
01:22:52,299 --> 01:22:54,767
He'll help you out.

1173
01:22:55,669 --> 01:22:57,261
I'll go get the reports.

1174
01:23:02,742 --> 01:23:04,903
Suhani, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1175
01:23:06,012 --> 01:23:07,104
Where are you going?

1176
01:23:07,214 --> 01:23:08,772
I need to get those reports.

1177
01:23:08,848 --> 01:23:10,372
I'll come with you.
- No need I'll get them.

1178
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:12,008
I'll come.

1179
01:23:36,376 --> 01:23:37,570
Suhani, he will be fine

1180
01:23:48,021 --> 01:23:50,922
I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

1181
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:54,126
That day at the
protest when the police..

1182
01:23:54,194 --> 01:23:57,129
..were taking brother away
I just wanted you to come.

1183
01:23:57,197 --> 01:23:58,721
Everything would've been fine.

1184
01:24:01,768 --> 01:24:06,171
I couldn't understand your problem,
the limitations you have.

1185
01:24:09,242 --> 01:24:10,766
And today when he was..

1186
01:24:11,344 --> 01:24:13,642
you could have left him
alone if you wanted to.

1187
01:24:14,614 --> 01:24:19,677
you took him to the hospital
in spite of him insulting you.

1188
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:28,293
Samarth was right that if we
don't help each other then who will.

1189
01:24:50,283 --> 01:24:53,081
I'm going to the police
station in the evening..

1190
01:24:53,286 --> 01:24:54,981
..to file a report on the attack.

1191
01:24:55,288 --> 01:24:57,518
Will you come as a witness, please?

1192
01:25:01,061 --> 01:25:02,187
No.

1193
01:25:07,834 --> 01:25:09,131
Suhani, I'll just come
back in two minutes.

1194
01:25:09,202 --> 01:25:11,602
I forgot my cell phone. Two minutes.

1195
01:25:14,541 --> 01:25:15,735
Okay.

1196
01:25:25,385 --> 01:25:26,682
you're a good liar.

1197
01:25:28,321 --> 01:25:29,515
you should carry on.

1198
01:25:33,927 --> 01:25:36,521
I just came here to tell you that
my brother has people everywhere.

1199
01:25:37,163 --> 01:25:38,790
I wouldn't testify if I was you.

1200
01:25:41,201 --> 01:25:42,759
They're watching you, Suraj.

1201
01:25:50,009 --> 01:25:51,237
I understand that you saved him.

1202
01:25:51,311 --> 01:25:52,642
Even that you took
him to the hospital..

1203
01:25:52,712 --> 01:25:54,942
..but what is the need to
go to the police station?

1204
01:25:55,448 --> 01:25:57,416
I'm telling you,
this isn't our battle.

1205
01:25:57,484 --> 01:26:00,419
you're PR will become a
dream if something goes wrong.

1206
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,748
That's a fact.

1207
01:26:23,009 --> 01:26:24,271
All right, let's do this.

1208
01:26:51,137 --> 01:26:52,536
He's in the next cabin.

1209
01:26:52,839 --> 01:26:54,932
Suraj. Suraj?

1210
01:26:58,077 --> 01:27:00,841
Officer Glen, hi. I'm Suhani.
Samarth Singh's sister.

1211
01:27:00,914 --> 01:27:03,212
I spoke to you earlier.
- Have a seat.

1212
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:08,214
Tell me.

1213
01:27:08,321 --> 01:27:13,418
This is Suraj Bhardwaj and
he's here to testify as a witness.

1214
01:27:14,127 --> 01:27:16,391
What are you doing?
They're here now.

1215
01:27:16,463 --> 01:27:19,591
Keep them there. I want
to fix her brother first.

1216
01:27:20,366 --> 01:27:23,699
Get it done soon. I
can't hold them much longer.

1217
01:27:24,704 --> 01:27:28,470
I've lined up some suspects. All
you got to do is pick them out..

1218
01:27:31,211 --> 01:27:34,578
Okay? Excuse me. yes?

1219
01:27:34,681 --> 01:27:36,842
Sir, can you come
in here now please?

1220
01:27:36,916 --> 01:27:38,850
There's something I
would like to show you.

1221
01:27:39,018 --> 01:27:40,918
I'll be right there. Just a minute.

1222
01:27:49,629 --> 01:27:50,789
What happened?

1223
01:27:51,698 --> 01:27:52,892
Something's fishy.

1224
01:27:55,602 --> 01:27:57,627
How did the people
who attacked Samarth..

1225
01:27:59,706 --> 01:28:01,867
..know the time he
left the police station?

1226
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,409
Hello? - Suhani,
what the hell is going on?

1227
01:28:09,482 --> 01:28:11,074
These guys are asking me
to leave the hospital.

1228
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:13,209
Something's wrong here.

1229
01:28:13,319 --> 01:28:17,915
I'm going nowhere. I'm
going nowhere. - Romi.

1230
01:28:19,659 --> 01:28:21,957
Sir, I think you
should check this out.

1231
01:28:22,028 --> 01:28:25,259
It seems your witness has a
criminal record back home in India.

1232
01:28:25,365 --> 01:28:26,423
Where did you find this?

1233
01:28:26,499 --> 01:28:28,831
I have some contacts
with the police in Mumbai.

1234
01:28:28,902 --> 01:28:32,235
I asked them for his record and
this is what they came up with.

1235
01:28:32,405 --> 01:28:33,895
Alright.

1236
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:39,310
They've escaped! Raise
the alarm! Raise the alarm!

1237
01:28:39,379 --> 01:28:42,576
Check the fire escape!
Suspects are Indian male and female.

1238
01:28:53,693 --> 01:28:55,092
Where the heck is this guy?

1239
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:06,668
you're in this state
because of me, brother.

1240
01:29:08,508 --> 01:29:10,703
But I feel more helpless.

1241
01:29:11,244 --> 01:29:13,075
We're constantly on the run.

1242
01:29:13,446 --> 01:29:16,210
Even after being fully
functional I feel so helpless.

1243
01:29:19,619 --> 01:29:23,146
But now I won't stay silent.

1244
01:29:26,259 --> 01:29:29,592
I'll stand up for you.
I'll fight for you.

1245
01:29:38,705 --> 01:29:46,942
''In you I find the need to live.''

1246
01:29:48,147 --> 01:29:56,316
''I ask you to find the way for me.''

1247
01:29:57,624 --> 01:30:05,998
''In you I find the need to live.''

1248
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:14,839
''I ask you to find the way for me.''

1249
01:30:14,907 --> 01:30:19,537
''I constantly get your support.''

1250
01:30:19,646 --> 01:30:24,276
''I live in your arms.''

1251
01:30:24,517 --> 01:30:31,821
''Where can I go now without you?''

1252
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:38,359
''I constantly get your support.''

1253
01:30:38,431 --> 01:30:43,198
''I live in your arms.''

1254
01:30:43,403 --> 01:30:50,536
''Where can I go now without you?''

1255
01:31:03,589 --> 01:31:06,114
'We've just got news that..'

1256
01:31:06,192 --> 01:31:10,094
'..a stranger has killed
a couple of mixed race..'

1257
01:31:10,163 --> 01:31:12,723
'..who were getting married.''

1258
01:31:13,032 --> 01:31:16,763
'According to the police,
we've got confirmed information..'

1259
01:31:16,836 --> 01:31:20,033
'..about murders of
three such married couples.'

1260
01:31:45,798 --> 01:31:51,828
''you gave me light in the dark.''

1261
01:31:55,041 --> 01:32:01,276
''Every breath of mine
is in sync with you.''

1262
01:32:04,317 --> 01:32:12,349
''I started feeling my
destiny in your hands.''

1263
01:32:12,425 --> 01:32:17,158
''The ambience has blossomed.''

1264
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:21,826
''All the sadness has gone.''

1265
01:32:21,934 --> 01:32:29,363
''Where can I go now without you?''

1266
01:32:31,277 --> 01:32:36,044
''I constantly get your support.''

1267
01:32:36,449 --> 01:32:40,783
''I live in your arms.''

1268
01:32:40,887 --> 01:32:48,191
''Where can I go now without you?''

1269
01:32:57,036 --> 01:32:58,333
'Barely had the city recovered..'

1270
01:32:58,404 --> 01:33:00,167
'..from the horror of
this serial killer..'

1271
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:02,969
'..butchering couples who had
married outside their community..'

1272
01:33:03,442 --> 01:33:06,673
'..when the news of the strip
club being torched hit the nation.'

1273
01:33:08,114 --> 01:33:11,015
'Twenty five men and women
have died in the fire so far.'

1274
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:13,278
''And about 50 are
seriously injured.'

1275
01:33:13,586 --> 01:33:16,555
'Police have found clues to
last night's explosion at Dukes..'

1276
01:33:16,656 --> 01:33:19,181
'..a popular strip club
in suburban Melbourne..'

1277
01:33:19,292 --> 01:33:23,422
'..leading to Suraj
Bhardwaj a man of Indian origin.'

1278
01:33:23,529 --> 01:33:26,430
'Police are yet to reveal
more details of the accused.'

1279
01:33:27,433 --> 01:33:29,924
'Here's an account from
the employee of the club.'

1280
01:33:30,136 --> 01:33:32,604
'This Suraj used to come here
often with lots of Indians.'

1281
01:33:34,807 --> 01:33:37,105
'They used sick photos as well.'

1282
01:33:37,443 --> 01:33:38,501
'Have you ever met him?'

1283
01:33:38,611 --> 01:33:39,703
'No. No.'

1284
01:33:39,812 --> 01:33:41,541
'I didn't really know him.'

1285
01:33:42,849 --> 01:33:44,874
'As the attacks on
Indians has increased..'

1286
01:33:44,951 --> 01:33:46,976
'..they authorities are
showing great concern..'

1287
01:33:47,086 --> 01:33:49,384
'..that the situation
may get out of hand.'

1288
01:33:49,722 --> 01:33:52,589
'A red alert has been sounded
through the city of Melbourne.'

1289
01:34:14,914 --> 01:34:16,472
What are you doing, Suraj?

1290
01:34:19,318 --> 01:34:21,946
Don't.. don't let this affect you.

1291
01:34:22,989 --> 01:34:28,393
They will pay for whatever they
are doing and saying in the news.

1292
01:34:29,495 --> 01:34:31,190
They won't have to pay for
anything, Suhani.

1293
01:34:31,297 --> 01:34:32,389
It's not a fair world.

1294
01:34:32,932 --> 01:34:36,060
They've been doing this
for years. Samarth was right.

1295
01:34:37,470 --> 01:34:41,167
They lie first and then blame
Indians for the mess they created.

1296
01:34:42,642 --> 01:34:45,270
This time they're using my
name and blaming the Indians.

1297
01:34:46,145 --> 01:34:48,705
Trust me justice will be
served because you're innocent.

1298
01:34:48,814 --> 01:34:50,679
Indians and
Australians will come together.

1299
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:52,547
We can bring them together.

1300
01:34:53,219 --> 01:34:57,417
And nothing will happen with
whatever they're saying or doing.

1301
01:34:57,523 --> 01:34:58,512
They can't hide the truth.

1302
01:34:58,591 --> 01:35:00,354
What truth are you
talking about, Suhani?

1303
01:35:00,459 --> 01:35:02,086
you want to know the truth?

1304
01:35:04,397 --> 01:35:06,524
My name is Jai Dixit
not Suraj Bhardwaj.

1305
01:35:08,167 --> 01:35:10,499
I came here on a
fake visa from Mumbai.

1306
01:35:10,803 --> 01:35:12,236
My papers are bogus.

1307
01:35:13,272 --> 01:35:16,935
I have only lied all my life.
That's the truth about me.

1308
01:35:21,113 --> 01:35:22,978
you want to know one more truth?

1309
01:35:23,282 --> 01:35:24,874
Want to know where
I'm going right now?

1310
01:35:25,885 --> 01:35:27,443
you think it was mere
coincidence that I was there..

1311
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,147
..when Samarth was being attacked?

1312
01:35:30,122 --> 01:35:31,248
No, Suhani.

1313
01:35:31,557 --> 01:35:36,517
That night after we fought, I
spent the night with Nicole.

1314
01:35:37,296 --> 01:35:38,627
Nicole is Russell's sister.

1315
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:41,393
She informed me about
Samarth being attacked.

1316
01:35:42,201 --> 01:35:44,226
And that's how I went to save him.

1317
01:35:46,105 --> 01:35:48,005
That's why she is now
blaming me for the blast.

1318
01:35:48,407 --> 01:35:50,034
She's conspiring with the police.

1319
01:35:50,643 --> 01:35:52,508
Suhani, this world is
not such a nice place.

1320
01:35:52,712 --> 01:35:54,703
And I'm not such a nice guy.

1321
01:36:00,419 --> 01:36:02,410
That story about your
friend was your story, right?

1322
01:36:06,559 --> 01:36:08,049
No, that was only my father's story.

1323
01:36:12,865 --> 01:36:16,801
My story will have a
different ending which I will write.

1324
01:36:17,903 --> 01:36:19,131
Not these Australians.

1325
01:36:23,876 --> 01:36:25,468
Please don't do this, Jai.

1326
01:36:28,581 --> 01:36:33,985
Stop! Stop! Please
listen to me please. Jai!

1327
01:36:35,388 --> 01:36:38,414
Jai, please don't do this. I've
seen this happen in my own house.

1328
01:36:38,491 --> 01:36:44,452
Nothing will get sorted. Please!
Just please don't do this, Jai!

1329
01:37:12,591 --> 01:37:14,058
Get out of the house!

1330
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,354
I want to know where Russell is.

1331
01:37:15,428 --> 01:37:16,725
Don't fool me!
- Get out of my house.

1332
01:37:16,796 --> 01:37:19,287
Where's Russell? Stop
fooling around. Where's Russell?

1333
01:37:31,410 --> 01:37:35,779
Russ! He's got me.

1334
01:37:43,322 --> 01:37:46,155
He's going to kill me. No!

1335
01:37:46,225 --> 01:37:51,288
Let go of me! No! No!

1336
01:38:01,574 --> 01:38:02,973
It's me.

1337
01:38:03,843 --> 01:38:06,471
I've got your little sister.
I've got Nicole.

1338
01:38:06,545 --> 01:38:08,410
What are doing with Nicole?

1339
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:14,751
you have no idea.
you can't even imagine.

1340
01:38:15,955 --> 01:38:20,756
I will find you and I
will peel of your skin.

1341
01:38:20,993 --> 01:38:26,488
you stinking snake! If you
touch my little sister..

1342
01:38:26,799 --> 01:38:30,997
..I will find yours and
I will slit her throat!

1343
01:38:32,538 --> 01:38:34,028
Do whatever you want.

1344
01:38:43,149 --> 01:38:44,343
Samarth?

1345
01:38:51,123 --> 01:38:52,556
No! No!

1346
01:38:53,425 --> 01:38:55,950
Somebody help me!

1347
01:38:56,428 --> 01:38:59,056
Samarth, what are you doing?
- No! Let go of me!

1348
01:39:00,065 --> 01:39:03,262
Samarth!
- Let go of me! Get off me!

1349
01:39:05,771 --> 01:39:07,796
Samarth, why are you taking
revenge from Russell using Nicole?

1350
01:39:10,309 --> 01:39:12,402
Samarth! Samarth, what's her fault?

1351
01:39:13,345 --> 01:39:15,210
What was my sister's fault?

1352
01:39:18,617 --> 01:39:22,018
'Okay, come on.
Another picture. With me.'

1353
01:39:24,156 --> 01:39:26,021
'Sheena, come on smile.'

1354
01:39:30,229 --> 01:39:32,493
'you're pregnant with an
Australian man's child, Sheena.'

1355
01:39:32,765 --> 01:39:33,959
'Sheena, you'll have to abort.'

1356
01:39:34,033 --> 01:39:35,364
'I'm sorry,
brother. Please, brother.'

1357
01:39:35,434 --> 01:39:37,493
'Who's this guy for whom you're
turning your back on your family?'

1358
01:39:37,603 --> 01:39:39,434
'Brother, please. This is my child.'

1359
01:39:39,505 --> 01:39:41,336
'What will happen to our
reputation in the community?'

1360
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,101
'What community, brother?'

1361
01:39:43,209 --> 01:39:44,733
'Brother, I love him. I love him.'

1362
01:39:44,843 --> 01:39:48,279
'This is my child. I
want to live with him.'

1363
01:39:48,347 --> 01:39:50,941
'Sheena, who is he?
- He loves me.'

1364
01:39:51,050 --> 01:39:52,449
'We'll have to abort this child.'

1365
01:39:52,551 --> 01:39:53,609
'No please. No please.'

1366
01:39:53,719 --> 01:39:55,619
'I'm doing this for us.
I'm doing this for you.'

1367
01:39:55,721 --> 01:39:58,383
'I'm really scared.'

1368
01:39:58,490 --> 01:39:59,821
'Nothing will happen.'

1369
01:40:00,025 --> 01:40:02,789
'I don't want to die.
- Don't worry, Sheena.'

1370
01:40:05,965 --> 01:40:07,125
'Sheena!

1371
01:40:10,836 --> 01:40:13,202
'Sheena!

1372
01:40:17,276 --> 01:40:19,005
'Sheena!

1373
01:40:22,648 --> 01:40:25,139
Till today I hear my
sister's cries.

1374
01:40:28,988 --> 01:40:30,785
Now it's sister for a sister.

1375
01:40:40,699 --> 01:40:45,068
Take a look. Take a
great look at this face.

1376
01:40:45,404 --> 01:40:47,872
All these years I've been
waiting for this moment.

1377
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:50,135
It was me who was in
love with your sister.

1378
01:40:50,242 --> 01:40:52,073
The kid in her belly was mine.

1379
01:40:52,144 --> 01:40:54,169
She was pregnant with my child.

1380
01:40:59,251 --> 01:41:02,948
you'll kill his sister
and he'll kill yours.

1381
01:41:06,025 --> 01:41:07,788
What about Suhani, Samarth?

1382
01:41:08,627 --> 01:41:11,095
When Parshuram left
to kill Aryan kings..

1383
01:41:13,999 --> 01:41:15,990
..do you know who he killed first?

1384
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:21,467
His mother.

1385
01:41:32,951 --> 01:41:38,218
With no weakness, who will stop me?

1386
01:41:51,704 --> 01:41:58,974
I'll do anything to protect my
roots, culture and tradition.

1387
01:42:02,481 --> 01:42:04,278
Suhani is not my weakness.

1388
01:42:08,587 --> 01:42:10,282
I'm doing this for my people.

1389
01:42:19,131 --> 01:42:21,258
No Indian will ever suffer again.

1390
01:42:22,768 --> 01:42:23,962
Never.

1391
01:42:26,605 --> 01:42:28,800
With Nicole's death
they'll understand..

1392
01:42:29,842 --> 01:42:31,309
..that we are no longer weak.

1393
01:42:33,879 --> 01:42:35,210
you've gone insane, Samarth.

1394
01:42:41,387 --> 01:42:43,116
I didn't think of one small thing.

1395
01:42:43,689 --> 01:42:45,623
Who should I put this blame on?

1396
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:49,957
I'm glad you came here.

1397
01:42:50,028 --> 01:42:51,620
The police will be here soon.

1398
01:42:54,032 --> 01:42:57,593
And by the time they trace me,
I'll be done with my work.

1399
01:43:03,742 --> 01:43:05,972
Come on! Come on!

1400
01:43:38,277 --> 01:43:39,403
Suspect is missing!

1401
01:43:39,478 --> 01:43:40,604
Move! Move! Move!

1402
01:43:40,679 --> 01:43:43,045
He got away!

1403
01:43:50,389 --> 01:43:52,220
Nothing. Get some bandages.
Hurry up.

1404
01:44:00,432 --> 01:44:03,492
Brother? Brother?

1405
01:44:10,609 --> 01:44:12,440
I recognised you as
soon as I saw you.

1406
01:44:16,782 --> 01:44:22,687
Remember, you helped a devotee
of Allah and He too will help you.

1407
01:44:26,692 --> 01:44:28,683
It's not right for
you to go out now.

1408
01:44:29,528 --> 01:44:31,223
The police are looking for you.

1409
01:44:33,232 --> 01:44:36,861
I have very little time.
Someone's life is in danger.

1410
01:44:51,717 --> 01:44:54,345
Hello? Jai? Where are you?

1411
01:44:54,419 --> 01:44:56,353
Suhani, we're as bad as them.

1412
01:44:57,422 --> 01:45:03,657
It was Samarth who killed
the mixed couples not Russell.

1413
01:45:04,329 --> 01:45:07,423
He has taken Nicole somewhere.
I'll have to find him.

1414
01:45:07,533 --> 01:45:11,162
Jai! - your sister's operation
had devastated him. - Jai.

1415
01:45:11,236 --> 01:45:13,204
Get out of there..
- Jai, listen to me!

1416
01:45:15,641 --> 01:45:19,270
Samarth knew that if he had
gone ahead with the operation..

1417
01:45:19,378 --> 01:45:21,812
..Sheena would die.
- What?

1418
01:45:22,915 --> 01:45:26,578
And so did I, but there
was nothing I could do.

1419
01:45:29,388 --> 01:45:30,719
'Suhani, please talk to him.'

1420
01:45:30,789 --> 01:45:32,222
'Suhani, you stay out of this.'

1421
01:45:32,324 --> 01:45:33,791
'Go inside! Stay there.
Or I'll kill you.'

1422
01:45:33,892 --> 01:45:35,120
'Suhani..
- Shut up! - Please brother.'

1423
01:45:35,193 --> 01:45:36,592
'Get inside!
- Brother, please.'

1424
01:45:36,695 --> 01:45:39,528
'Brother, I don't want to die.
- Everything will be all right.'

1425
01:45:39,598 --> 01:45:43,591
'It's too late. This
abortion can kill her. - Please.'

1426
01:45:43,669 --> 01:45:45,261
'We'll have to go
ahead with the abortion.'

1427
01:45:45,671 --> 01:45:47,104
'We have to abort this baby.'

1428
01:45:59,585 --> 01:46:02,076
I guess that's why
I've always tried..

1429
01:46:02,287 --> 01:46:04,755
..to bring Australians
and Indians together.

1430
01:46:04,823 --> 01:46:08,122
Because if they were,
then Sheena might have..

1431
01:46:14,099 --> 01:46:16,067
Brother would have accepted her.

1432
01:46:18,070 --> 01:46:19,662
you were right.

1433
01:46:20,238 --> 01:46:23,605
I was being a hypocrite..

1434
01:46:23,942 --> 01:46:30,848
..I couldn't stand up
for my sister.

1435
01:46:31,717 --> 01:46:33,184
Suhani.

1436
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:37,611
Jai, you'll have to save Nicole.

1437
01:46:37,723 --> 01:46:39,213
you have to stop my brother.

1438
01:46:41,793 --> 01:46:43,420
I couldn't save my sister..

1439
01:46:43,495 --> 01:46:45,429
..but if something
happened to Nicole..

1440
01:46:45,497 --> 01:46:48,523
..then I'll never forgive myself.

1441
01:46:49,267 --> 01:46:51,497
Suhani, listen to me. Just get
out of that place right now.

1442
01:46:53,572 --> 01:46:55,836
Suhani! Suhani, I'm coming there.

1443
01:46:55,907 --> 01:46:57,875
Knock! Knock! Who's there?

1444
01:46:57,943 --> 01:46:59,604
It's your friend Russell.

1445
01:46:59,878 --> 01:47:01,140
I'm okay.

1446
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,275
Get her out!

1447
01:47:09,821 --> 01:47:11,083
Suhani, just get out of there.

1448
01:47:11,156 --> 01:47:13,215
I'm fine, Jai. Just go.

1449
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:16,588
Suhani!

1450
01:47:18,597 --> 01:47:21,191
I know you're in there. I'm coming.

1451
01:47:21,867 --> 01:47:23,562
Suhani, I'm coming there.

1452
01:47:23,635 --> 01:47:28,038
I'm fine. Go save Nicole.
Don't worry about me.

1453
01:47:30,809 --> 01:47:34,472
This violence will end
only if we help them.

1454
01:47:36,148 --> 01:47:38,742
This is the only way
this is going to end.

1455
01:47:39,384 --> 01:47:40,510
Suhani.

1456
01:47:41,253 --> 01:47:43,517
I know where brother has taken her.

1457
01:47:44,356 --> 01:47:45,550
Warren Street.

1458
01:47:46,458 --> 01:47:48,016
Sheena's abortion took place there.

1459
01:47:49,227 --> 01:47:51,092
Do this for me please.

1460
01:47:52,664 --> 01:47:58,660
Jai, I.. I love you.

1461
01:48:01,039 --> 01:48:03,507
Suhani, I.. Suhani!

1462
01:48:03,675 --> 01:48:05,472
Save Nicole save the city.

1463
01:48:05,544 --> 01:48:09,537
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.

1464
01:48:11,116 --> 01:48:14,108
Please.
- Suhani!

1465
01:48:15,921 --> 01:48:16,979
Please.

1466
01:48:19,725 --> 01:48:26,255
''When I had you I lost you.''

1467
01:48:29,167 --> 01:48:35,629
''My heart cries without tears.''

1468
01:48:38,643 --> 01:48:46,550
''Why did my dreams come
so close and disappear?''

1469
01:48:46,618 --> 01:48:51,214
''It's impossible to
live without you.''

1470
01:48:51,323 --> 01:48:56,056
''There's sadness in my heart.''

1471
01:48:56,261 --> 01:49:03,360
''Where can I go now without you?''

1472
01:49:05,504 --> 01:49:09,964
''I constantly get your support.''

1473
01:49:10,041 --> 01:49:13,738
''I live in your arms.''

1474
01:49:14,913 --> 01:49:22,217
''Where can I go now without you?''

1475
01:49:50,916 --> 01:49:52,144
Keep digging, Romi.

1476
01:50:06,865 --> 01:50:08,025
Let Nicole go, Samarth.

1477
01:50:10,068 --> 01:50:12,866
Have you gone blind?

1478
01:50:13,772 --> 01:50:19,335
Romi and I, we are
your own. Not Nicole.

1479
01:50:20,478 --> 01:50:21,877
They're murderers.

1480
01:50:22,848 --> 01:50:25,043
you want to get every
Indian killed here, Samarth?

1481
01:50:26,585 --> 01:50:29,748
If something happens to
Nicole this entire city will burn.

1482
01:50:29,821 --> 01:50:31,083
Let it burn!

1483
01:50:32,791 --> 01:50:34,554
What about my sister who
was killed by Russell?

1484
01:50:34,626 --> 01:50:36,526
you killed your sister not Russell!

1485
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:44,494
No. No.

1486
01:50:44,603 --> 01:50:46,696
Had you not had any
problem with their relationship..

1487
01:50:46,805 --> 01:50:48,397
..you wouldn't have to
see this day.

1488
01:50:49,074 --> 01:50:50,405
Russell killed Sheena.

1489
01:50:51,643 --> 01:50:54,476
you talk about culture
and tradition, Samarth?

1490
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:58,077
This is what you're
doing for your country?

1491
01:50:59,384 --> 01:51:01,079
Look inside of you.

1492
01:51:02,387 --> 01:51:04,082
you're running away from yourself.

1493
01:51:04,723 --> 01:51:06,520
you're the racist not just them.

1494
01:51:07,092 --> 01:51:08,923
you couldn't even see
the love your sister had.

1495
01:51:12,764 --> 01:51:18,794
Romi, continue digging. Don't
listen to him. He's gone mad.

1496
01:51:19,204 --> 01:51:22,071
They're the bad ones.
We're the good ones.

1497
01:51:22,507 --> 01:51:26,500
And in this fight, the good
will triumph. So just help me win.

1498
01:51:26,611 --> 01:51:27,873
The line dividing good and bad..

1499
01:51:27,946 --> 01:51:29,811
..comes straight
thru the heart, Samarth.

1500
01:51:35,487 --> 01:51:38,650
We all have virtues and vices.

1501
01:51:40,125 --> 01:51:42,423
But the one who has the courage
to see the vices in himself..

1502
01:51:43,595 --> 01:51:45,062
..he is truly human, Samarth.

1503
01:51:48,366 --> 01:51:50,357
I'm right and they are wrong.

1504
01:51:51,569 --> 01:51:54,333
you want to kill me,
right? Come on. Come on kill me.

1505
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:56,698
My death will not end this.

1506
01:51:56,808 --> 01:51:59,208
If I kill one man like you, I
don't know how many will be born.

1507
01:51:59,711 --> 01:52:02,908
I can kill you, but I can't get
rid of your diseased thoughts.

1508
01:52:10,388 --> 01:52:16,224
The solution is that
you stay alive, not die.

1509
01:52:18,263 --> 01:52:19,753
you'll have to live.

1510
01:52:21,466 --> 01:52:23,730
Knowing that you're solely
responsible for your sisters' death.

1511
01:52:27,038 --> 01:52:29,063
Recognise the vices
within you, Samarth

1512
01:52:29,841 --> 01:52:31,399
Recognise the vices within you.

1513
01:53:03,008 --> 01:53:06,637
I'm right! I know they're the
bad ones! They're the bad one!

1514
01:53:17,255 --> 01:53:22,192
you were wrong. We were bad.

1515
01:53:24,229 --> 01:53:25,594
Romi!

1516
01:53:28,833 --> 01:53:30,994
No, Romi.
- you were wrong!

1517
01:53:32,270 --> 01:53:34,636
We were bad!

1518
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:37,838
There were not bad.
- Romi, don't!

1519
01:53:38,109 --> 01:53:41,135
We were bad!

1520
01:53:42,414 --> 01:53:45,349
We were bad!
- Romi!

1521
01:53:46,017 --> 01:53:52,183
Not them! We were bad.

1522
01:53:53,124 --> 01:53:55,558
you were wrong!

1523
01:53:57,962 --> 01:54:01,159
you were wrong!

1524
01:54:22,053 --> 01:54:28,322
''The lord has had mercy on me.''

1525
01:54:32,130 --> 01:54:39,434
''All this has
happened because of you.''

1526
01:54:42,006 --> 01:54:50,436
''I finally feel
alive here with you.''

1527
01:54:50,615 --> 01:54:55,552
''On your shoulder
every moment lasts.''

1528
01:54:55,620 --> 01:55:00,580
''I hope this goes on forever.''

1529
01:55:00,859 --> 01:55:08,356
''Where can I go now without you?''

1530
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:24,846
'Who claims that the era of
magic has become extinct?'

1531
