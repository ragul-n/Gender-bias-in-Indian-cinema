1
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:51,792
What's up?
Been summoned?

2
00:07:51,924 --> 00:07:53,792
Yes yes!

3
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:54,958
Ma!

4
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,859
Anu, Is there someone called
Tomichan in your company?

5
00:07:56,991 --> 00:08:00,094
ln HRD. Thomichan Kozrakkuzhi.
Do you know him?

6
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:02,192
Who's that?
No idea.

7
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:06,094
- They said he works at STAR.
- Could be in the KP road office then.

8
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:07,224
-Why?
- Nothing...

9
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:09,826
-Awedding proposal.
-Whose wedding is it?

10
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,426
- Mine.
- Shut up!

11
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,092
Where's your friend?

12
00:08:13,224 --> 00:08:15,426
l thought you guys
wouldn't show up today.

13
00:08:15,558 --> 00:08:16,992
Busy at office, Uncle...

14
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:18,124
That's why we're late.

15
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:21,961
That's alright. l thought
l should ask you all first.

16
00:08:22,691 --> 00:08:25,226
You are his close friends, right?

17
00:08:25,524 --> 00:08:29,127
This isn't for the first time.
But it's been a fewdays no_

18
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:31,726
And his phone is always switched o_.
Who knom what's happening.

19
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:33,559
lt's alright, Uncle.
Don't wory.

20
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:36,693
You knowwhat he's like.
He doesn't even call us.

21
00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:38,091
Didn't he tell anyone?

22
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:43,429
Last Wednesday he was
in Santhosh's room.

23
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,692
- Didn't he say where he was going?
- Seems he didn't.

24
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:49,060
lf he doesn't come today,
we'll make a police complaint.

25
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:52,093
Wait, Uncle.
He'll be back.

26
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:53,925
No, No! Something's wrong.

27
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:56,226
He hasn't called
anyone all these days.

28
00:08:56,524 --> 00:08:58,759
Uncle... don't take
it to the Police now.

29
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:01,193
Let's wait.

30
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:04,727
We'll look.
Let the Police also look.

31
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:06,959
Uncle, it's better not
to inform the Police now.

32
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:08,659
- Let's wait.
- But why?

33
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:12,494
- Is there a problem?
- There's no problem...

34
00:09:12,624 --> 00:09:13,057
Then?

35
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:15,593
-Why take it to the Police unnecessarily?
- It's not unnecessay!

36
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:18,426
Leave it, Uncle.
We'll find out.

37
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,093
Where are we going
to find him?

38
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:24,527
How can we just ignore
it and keep quiet?

39
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:26,625
lt's alright.

40
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:29,793
One ofyou come with me to
the Police station in the morning.

41
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:34,126
- Uncle... the problem is--
- What, you don't have the time?

42
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:35,859
- It's not that.
- Then?

43
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:38,760
Uncle, don't go
to the Police now.

44
00:09:38,857 --> 00:09:39,792
Why?

45
00:09:40,691 --> 00:09:41,958
We don't know if it's true...

46
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:44,860
- Could be a rumor.
-What?

47
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,962
They say he's got a diamond,
which he's tying to sell.

48
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:54,962
That's probably why he's not coming home.
Seems it's worth Rs. 20-30 Lakhs.

49
00:09:55,058 --> 00:09:58,428
-Where did you hearthis?
- People are talking.

50
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:02,060
That's all we know.
He doesn't tell us these things.

51
00:10:02,158 --> 00:10:04,927
But why's his
phone switched off?

52
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:09,695
Because of its high value he must be
concerned about the safety and security.

53
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,958
Security?

54
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:13,460
Could be something like that.

55
00:10:31,224 --> 00:10:33,125
What's the time on
yourwatch now?

56
00:10:33,824 --> 00:10:37,460
- 5.25
- 5.25... One hourfrom now,

57
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:40,060
that means, at 6.25,
you should call my number.

58
00:10:40,158 --> 00:10:42,727
lf l don't answer, you should call
me again after 5 minutes.

59
00:10:42,857 --> 00:10:46,094
lf l still don't answer...
call this number

60
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:49,093
and tell him that you can't reach me.
Then he'll tell you what to do.

61
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:53,962
Got it? Or give me another ring
before calling on that number.

62
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:56,960
Look, just three calls.
Afterthat, call this number.

63
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:59,860
- Got it?
-You mean, first call at 6.25,

64
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,592
Then 6.30.

65
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:03,659
Afterthat you should
call once again at 6.35.

66
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:07,995
Only then you call on this number.
Got it? Don't mess it up.

67
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:08,858
No, no.

68
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,826
- Is your phone charged?
-Yes.

69
00:11:10,924 --> 00:11:13,192
Don't take the phone if
anyone calls in bemeen.

70
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:19,992
Park it there.

71
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:21,926
No, don't do it.
That would only add to the confusion.

72
00:11:28,691 --> 00:11:29,925
Basheerbhai...

73
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,625
lt's Sibi.

74
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,425
l'm in the lobby.

75
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:36,526
Where in the lobby?
l'm right here.

76
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:39,459
Are you wearing a black shirt?

77
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:40,492
Yeah, black shirt.

78
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:42,559
l'm also wearing a black shirt.

79
00:11:46,857 --> 00:11:48,726
So this is Sibi Sebastian.

80
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:55,461
The MD changed his plans yesterday.
That's why l asked you to come today.

81
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:56,591
That's alright.

82
00:11:57,658 --> 00:12:01,428
He's a vey busy man. He's staying
back just because l asked him.

83
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:03,758
Listen...

84
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:05,791
One more thing...

85
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:09,593
HereaRer, we'll be dealing
with you directly.

86
00:12:09,691 --> 00:12:11,959
lfyou have any partners
you deal with them. Not us.

87
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:15,194
- It's just me.
- How do l kno_

88
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,560
l'm mentioning it because
you're newto us.

89
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:35,559
- Look Basheerbhai--
- Shhh...

90
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:49,928
Don't ever discuss anything inside a lift.
There's a camera on top.

91
00:12:59,758 --> 00:13:03,696
No, no the first 60 you
were talking about works for me.

92
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:06,227
No, no... that's not for me.

93
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:08,793
Tell me, you should tell me.

94
00:13:08,892 --> 00:13:11,160
No hury.

95
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,693
But money stays the same.

96
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:14,459
No.

97
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:17,461
l can't afford more.

98
00:13:18,858 --> 00:13:21,494
That depends on how smart you are.

99
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:25,662
No... no... l'll leave in the morning.
Calicut to Sharjah.

100
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:27,527
l'll call you later. Yeah.

101
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,693
He is the one.

102
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,161
- The gemstone.
- Oh yeah. Sit down.

103
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:37,827
-Where are you from?
- Pala.

104
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:39,126
Sit down.

105
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:41,593
So...

106
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:43,593
What gem is it?

107
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:44,959
Emerald

108
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,761
Emerald...
Where did you get it from?

109
00:13:47,858 --> 00:13:50,061
Actually, someone got it from
a temple in Trivandrum.

110
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:52,427
- It's genuine.
- Let me take a look.

111
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,761
Show me the stone.
Show me.

112
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,694
You're showing me a picture!!??

113
00:14:05,825 --> 00:14:08,127
l need to see the real stone.

114
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:10,226
Yeah, l'll showyou.

115
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,595
But l need to clarify
certain things before that.

116
00:14:14,692 --> 00:14:15,459
What?

117
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:19,428
Well... suppose we
do decide on a price...

118
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,095
Ho_ll you pay me?

119
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:25,160
By DD...?

120
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:27,960
Or in cash?
Ho_ When? Where?

121
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:30,027
Forget that now.

122
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,693
Showme the stone first.

123
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:34,926
Basheerbhai...

124
00:14:40,192 --> 00:14:42,460
So where's the stone?

125
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:44,694
lt's in my custody...
but...

126
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:46,059
Then what's the problem?

127
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,626
You've seen the photo, right?
It's original.

128
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:50,660
Nothing to wory. It's
from a temple. It's real.

129
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:53,194
But unless we give him an idea
about the price he'll be suspicious.

130
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,962
Him? Who's this 'him' that
you've never mentioned before?

131
00:14:57,092 --> 00:14:58,693
The gem is with him.

132
00:14:59,492 --> 00:15:00,826
l see...!

133
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,694
He's not answering the phone.

134
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:03,459
Hey!

135
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:06,193
You should've mentioned this earlier.

136
00:15:06,492 --> 00:15:08,227
l'll sort it out. l just need
to go to Trivandrum.

137
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:10,960
- Give me two more days.
-You're wasting our time.

138
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:12,793
No, no, l'll handle it.

139
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:16,962
Eveything was going fine until someone
inte_ered and changed his mind.

140
00:15:18,758 --> 00:15:21,061
Just give me an
idea about the price.

141
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:23,159
The MDjust told you, right...

142
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:25,627
He can't give you a rate
without actually seeing it.

143
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,429
Unless we fix a price and give
him an advance he won't show it.

144
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:32,527
- Ok then do it.
- l can't do it.

145
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:33,760
You don't know my situation.

146
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:34,859
Oh!

147
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:39,095
Then don't get into such business.

148
00:15:39,192 --> 00:15:41,894
ln this business, unless you
invest you can't make money.

149
00:15:51,592 --> 00:15:55,562
- Have you really seen the gem?
- Of course! l took this photo.

150
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:58,426
Bhai...

151
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,425
Yeah.

152
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:09,593
What's that guy up to?

153
00:16:09,725 --> 00:16:12,461
He doesn't have the gem.
Only that photo.

154
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:13,726
What do you think,
seeing the photo?

155
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:16,661
lt looks valuable.
But he is helpless.

156
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:17,092
Why?

157
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:20,428
Now he says that the gem
is with someone else.

158
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:22,193
And that guy doesn't trust him.

159
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:25,662
Then get that guy's details
and get rid of this one.

160
00:16:25,758 --> 00:16:27,093
Let's deal directly.
Okay?

161
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:30,094
That's ok. He'll
expect at least Rs.15,OOO.

162
00:16:30,225 --> 00:16:31,759
Give him something.

163
00:16:39,858 --> 00:16:42,962
He's not going to take
your calls. Forget it.

164
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:45,194
- Let me go to Trivandrum and see.
- That's up to you.

165
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:48,161
-We're also leaving.
- God! So what about the gem?

166
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:49,725
Gem...

167
00:16:51,758 --> 00:16:54,161
lt's obvious that
you can't pull this o_.

168
00:16:55,059 --> 00:17:00,564
lfyou agree, give us his details
and we'll contact him directly.

169
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,560
Look, Bhai... l...

170
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:05,862
We'll give you
10 Thousand rupees.

171
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,227
Here.
Give me his name and address.

172
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:11,593
Only if you want to..

00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:12,993
Yeah, l'm coming!
Coming!

174
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:13,959
Please hury.

175
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:15,092
Here.

176
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:18,760
Do you know how long
l've been chasing this?

177
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:20,126
This doesn't even
meet my daily expense.

178
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:23,428
We're giving you this money
without any surety.

179
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,160
Only because it's you.

180
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:28,762
You think we couldn't
do it ourselves?

181
00:17:29,192 --> 00:17:29,659
Here.

182
00:17:34,758 --> 00:17:36,694
But, this is only nine thousand.

183
00:17:36,825 --> 00:17:38,459
Yeah, ten minus one is nine.

184
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,960
- Minus one?
-Yeah one is my commission.

185
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:42,159
That's on you.

186
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:45,694
100/o is usual in evey business.

187
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:48,761
- Bhai, shall l ask you something?
- Hmm?

188
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,828
- l know someone who's got a barn-owl.
-What?

189
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:54,892
A barn-owl.

190
00:17:55,725 --> 00:17:58,227
lfyou're interested, l can
get it for you. It's genuine.

191
00:17:58,525 --> 00:17:59,893
Will the MD be interested?

192
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:03,794
Bugger off, son...
Bugger off!

193
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:02,194
-Where are you?
- l'm around.

194
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:05,128
Your parents are worried.
You better call them.

195
00:19:05,225 --> 00:19:07,560
They think you're missing.
They're upset.

196
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:09,994
And what do l tell them?
That l've been found?

197
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,227
lt's easy foryou to switch off
your phone and vanish.

198
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:14,160
l'm the one who gets the calls!

199
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:15,593
Forget it!

200
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:17,659
Are you home tomorro_

201
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:18,693

205
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:50,494
Where were you?
l've been ringing the bell for a while.

206
00:19:50,592 --> 00:19:52,193
l was dying my clothes
on the terrace.

207
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,561
Planning to settle down here?

208
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:57,827
No way!
You should go home.

209
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:01,028
Let my clothes dy first.
l did call home.

210
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,226
Everything's fine there.

211
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:04,960
What about you?
Are you working in the aRernoon?

212
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:08,628
ln your honor,
l'll sleep offthis afternoon.

213
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:12,059
What do you want for lunch?

214
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,159
What's available?

215
00:20:13,892 --> 00:20:17,829
- Beef, porotta, chapathi, chicken...
- 2 Porottas and a plate of beeffy.

216
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:21,192
Hello.

217
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:24,895
Hi l'm calling from Kargil colony...
the house next to the ground.

218
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:25,658
Yeah.

219
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,226
One biriyani...

220
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:31,561
Chicken biriyani,
three porottas and a beeffy.

221
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:37,561
Forever porotta and beef!

222
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:39,994
Go home and eat something nice.

223
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:44,962
Dude, never look down
upon any food.

224
00:20:45,092 --> 00:20:48,728
Porotta 8 beef is the favorite
food of millions of our people.

225
00:20:48,825 --> 00:20:51,027
ls it right to belittle it,
eh Santhosh?

226
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,860
Drinking a lot these days?

227
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,061
No way.
Once in a while.

228
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:07,629
l couldn't ask you last time.
You were too tense.

229
00:21:07,758 --> 00:21:09,927
What's happening with
your diamonds and rubies?

230
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:12,994
l was wondering
when you would ask.

231
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,660
- Did it work out?
- No. It's all over.

232
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,227
Eveything was going well.
But somehow it didn't happen.

233
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:21,962
That's how it is. Sometimes it
works out, sometimes it doesn't.

234
00:21:22,092 --> 00:21:26,629
lt's said that even a tiger makes a kill
only after tying and failing ten times.

235
00:21:26,725 --> 00:21:28,093
So what are our chances?

236
00:21:28,692 --> 00:21:31,027
Where did you get
this Tiger info?

237
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:33,494
l... read it in
a children's magazine.

238
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,959
We're still subscribing to it.

239
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:37,493
Dude...

240
00:21:38,892 --> 00:21:40,426
- Hey!!
-Yeah?

241
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:41,993
N4 wedding's fixed.

242
00:21:42,758 --> 00:21:44,160
Fantastic!

243
00:21:44,258 --> 00:21:45,627
When was it fixed?

244
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:47,827
Only mo days.
It was sudden.

245
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:50,861
- Is it that Valsa?-
- Sheesh! She got married long back.

246
00:21:50,992 --> 00:21:53,094
This is Leena Mayam
George Kudappanakunnel.

247
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:56,194
Anyway it had to happen
one day. So why put it off?

248
00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:58,460
So you're also getting hitched.

249
00:21:58,558 --> 00:21:59,459
Cool!

250
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:01,727
l'm glad that she
works here.

251
00:22:01,825 --> 00:22:03,960
We can continue to live here.

252
00:22:04,092 --> 00:22:06,828
Yeah that's right. You needn't
Iook for another house.

253
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:11,229
But no one's seeing howdoors
are closing on this poor wayfarer...

254
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:15,762
lt's not going to be you or me who decides
your place in this house in future.

255
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:18,194
lt will be Kudappanakunnel
Leena Maryam George.

256
00:22:18,492 --> 00:22:21,561
- It will depend entirely on her attitude.
-And what is it?

257
00:22:21,692 --> 00:22:22,659
Howwould l kno_

258
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:25,161
What's her attitude towards you?

259
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,428
Anyway, both of us will
have to change our routes.

260
00:22:28,526 --> 00:22:32,830
Two people who walked on mo paths
will have to walk on the same path now.

261
00:22:33,626 --> 00:22:36,528
The problem with small
paths is, that they is narrow.

262
00:22:36,626 --> 00:22:38,995
One person will have to walk in
front and the other at the back.

263
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:41,828
lfyou don't argue about
that, things will go well.

264
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,828
l've no fight about anything.

265
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:53,727
Parcel.

266
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:02,227
Keep the balance.

267
00:23:05,193 --> 00:23:08,496
l wonder who did these jobs
before these guys came to Kerala.

268
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:11,462
lf they hadn't come, people like
you may have had some work.

269
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,560
Drink!

270
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,796
Do you know...
the world economy...

271
00:23:16,926 --> 00:23:20,863
The most important factor
for it's stability is poverty.

272
00:23:20,993 --> 00:23:23,562
lt's because there are so
many poor people in this world...

273
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,629
that the rich get cheap labour.

274
00:23:26,726 --> 00:23:29,695
For their prosperity, there should
always be poverty in the world.

275
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:30,727
Understood?

276
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,627
ls this also from your
children's magazine?

277
00:23:32,726 --> 00:23:33,660
Shut up!

278
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:37,996
Look at me.
If l had Rs.5 lakhs yesterday,

279
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:40,462
l could've made Rs. 20 Lakhs
on the spot.

280
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:43,595
But l didn't have 5 lakhs.
So my loss was 20 lakhs.

281
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:46,562
He who has 5, will
make 20, 30, 50 and so on.

282
00:23:46,693 --> 00:23:48,795
He who doesn't have it
will sit here like a sucker.

283
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:52,862
l'm having another drink.
l'm starting to feel hungy.

284
00:23:56,926 --> 00:24:02,197
People here gossip
that l'm a jobless fraud.

285
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,995
My friends are married
and settled while l'm not.

286
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:06,760
-Who says so?
- Forget it.

287
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,762
l knowthings about
life that they don't.

288
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,862
The future is all about
freelance business.

289
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,530
- l'll showthem soon.
- That's up to you.

290
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,229
But your ideas are
not at all realistic.

291
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:21,828
What do you mean
'not realistic'?

292
00:24:21,926 --> 00:24:24,862
All your schemes need
crores of money. That's the problem.

293
00:24:25,993 --> 00:24:30,063
Then l'll be realistic and start a
small paan shop. Will youjoin me?

294
00:24:32,793 --> 00:24:34,828
Dude, my aim is
to hit the jackpot.

295
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,229
l don't want to be like you and
work for someone else my entire life.

296
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:41,229
You and your theories!

297
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:44,462
Has anything ever worked out?
It's just a waste of money.

298
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,530
lt's not my theoy that's wrong.
It's my calculation that went wrong.

299
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:51,195
l don't have the money.
But l'll find someone soon.

300
00:24:51,493 --> 00:24:52,160
l'll showyou then.

301
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,063
Don't blame anyone.
It's a crooked business.

302
00:24:56,193 --> 00:24:57,127
Crooked?

303
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:00,563
We buy something at a lower price
and ty and sell it at a higher price.

304
00:25:00,693 --> 00:25:03,228
l know how it works.
It's not crooked.

305
00:25:03,526 --> 00:25:06,195
lt is crooked. You live
in a world offantasy.

306
00:25:06,493 --> 00:25:11,865
Santhosh, life is only interesting
with a touch offantasy!

307
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,995
''All by himself'

308
00:25:23,926 --> 00:25:25,794

at random times.''

340
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:27,697
''All by himself
He slips, escapes and appears''

341
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:29,427
''All by himself'

342
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:33,664
''All by himself
He slips, escapes and appears''

343
00:28:33,793 --> 00:28:35,995
''All by himself'

344
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:39,228
Hello, this is Thamban.

345
00:28:39,493 --> 00:28:41,027
Needed to know something.

346
00:28:41,126 --> 00:28:44,529
Who's in Jharkhand no_

347
00:28:45,126 --> 00:28:45,993
Ah

348
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:48,994
Do you knowanyone
who can help me?

349
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,595
l wouldn't do such a thing.

350
00:28:52,693 --> 00:28:55,228
Ok! Ok! l'll call you.
Ok!

351
00:28:56,626 --> 00:28:57,860
lt's not us.

352
00:28:57,993 --> 00:29:00,095
But you'll have to pay anyway.

353
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:04,630
This is a Central Govt# s fund. But
the State Govt. Is in charge.

354
00:29:04,726 --> 00:29:06,661
How did you get hold ofthis?

355
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:07,794
Well...

356
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:10,962
- It's ok if it's a secret.
- No, Thamba'cha.

357
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:14,196
When l go to discuss it
people might ask details.

358
00:29:14,493 --> 00:29:18,129
lt'll look bad if l
don't knowthe details.

359
00:29:18,226 --> 00:29:20,094
The details are simple.

360
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,727
l'll tell you.

361
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,664
There's money to buy
10,OOO ycles for tribal women.

362
00:29:26,793 --> 00:29:27,994
But no one
knom about it.

363
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:29,928
The question is whether
we can get the contract or not.

364
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:30,693
What ifwe get it?

365
00:29:30,826 --> 00:29:33,528
We can get the cycle for
halfthe price and make a profit.

366
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:36,528
- Tell me the details.
- It is simple.

367
00:29:36,626 --> 00:29:38,694
We'll quote the local price.

368
00:29:38,793 --> 00:29:43,497
Which is about 4000 for a cycle?
But we'll buy it for less than 2000.

369
00:29:43,593 --> 00:29:45,227
- How come?
- Thamba'cha...

370
00:29:45,526 --> 00:29:48,028
You do know, that China has
the most cycles in the world.

371
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,760
Really?

372
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:51,427
Yes.

373
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,496
But no one wants cycles there.
They all want cars and bikes.

374
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,161
Cycles don't sell because
no one buys them.

375
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,962
lfwe make the right moves, we'll
get it for the price we want.

376
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,529
-Are you talking about secondhand cycles?
- No, brand-new!

377
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,928
But they don't have
Iadies' cycles.

378
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:06,594
- We can't help it.
- That's alright.

379
00:30:06,726 --> 00:30:07,560
Anotherthing...

380
00:30:07,693 --> 00:30:12,097
lfwe manage to import them
duty free our profit goes up.

381
00:30:12,993 --> 00:30:15,628
We'll highlight that
it's for tribal women.

382
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:22,462
- So that's 10,OOO... into
- Make it 4,OOO.

383
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:29,495
- Four crores.
-Yeah, four crores.

384
00:30:29,793 --> 00:30:32,896
- Our share?
- Minimum two crores!

385
00:30:32,993 --> 00:30:35,729
- l'll have to grease many palms.
- So what?

386
00:30:37,793 --> 00:30:39,628
Where did you get these details?

387
00:30:40,226 --> 00:30:42,528
He has lost interest in all this.

388
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,895
We'll pay him something.
l'll take care of that.

389
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:46,160
ls this for real?

390
00:30:46,693 --> 00:30:48,995
What sort of a question
is that Thambacha?

391
00:30:49,093 --> 00:30:51,028
Do you know anyone is China?

392
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:53,061
l know someone who's
studying there.

393
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,795
His friend's father
runs a ycle business.

394
00:30:55,926 --> 00:30:57,560
That's how l came
to know about all this.

395
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,130
We'll need money to go
there and study the situation.

396
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:05,028
Yeah. Vey necessay.

397
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,127
Yeah.

398
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:09,096
You'll have to
arrange the money.

399
00:31:09,226 --> 00:31:11,795
l've invested my money in
another business. It's tied up.

400
00:31:11,893 --> 00:31:14,629
That's not possible.
We'll invest fiRy-fifty.

401
00:31:14,726 --> 00:31:17,795
l brought the project, right?

402
00:31:17,893 --> 00:31:20,528
So, consider my
commission as my share.

403
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,429
From now on l'll have
to deal with eveything.

404
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:26,496
What if l ask you
for a commission?

405
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:27,560
Think about that.

406
00:31:27,693 --> 00:31:31,897
Look, they'll begin work
only ifwe give an advance.

407
00:31:32,026 --> 00:31:35,863
We'll need money. Oryou should
bring someone who has money.

408
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:38,695
But your share
will go down.

409
00:31:39,193 --> 00:31:41,628
You'll even be slowly
removed from this business.

410
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,095
Hey! Wash it properly.
You won't hurt it.

411
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:51,895
We can give him a cheque.
But that's not the problem.

412
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,529
- He needs a guarantee.
- Of course.

413
00:31:56,093 --> 00:31:59,763
lt's not a big deal of money.
Why's he asking for property_ocuments?

414
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,762
- Then look for someone else.
-Who else?

415
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,596
We have Mortuay Shaji...
then there's Ismu.

416
00:32:05,726 --> 00:32:06,159
lsmu?

417
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:09,196
Yeah. Only they'll be ready
to deal without any guarantee.

418
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,131
- l can't ask Ismu.
-Why? Do you owe him anything?

419
00:32:13,227 --> 00:32:15,629
- No.
- Then leave it.

420
00:32:16,194 --> 00:32:17,895
- l have an idea.
-What?

421
00:32:18,027 --> 00:32:20,863
l can give a cheque and
sign a stamp paper.

422
00:32:20,994 --> 00:32:22,495
Babukutty said you could
put in a word for me.

423
00:32:22,594 --> 00:32:24,629
What can l say?
There's no point.

424
00:32:24,727 --> 00:32:27,096
l just need it for
six months. l'm vey sure.

425
00:32:27,227 --> 00:32:30,196
That's not enough.
They should also feel sure.

426
00:32:30,494 --> 00:32:32,829
The thing about Shaji and
Ismu is that they're sure.

427
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:35,095
They know howto
get their money back.

428
00:32:35,227 --> 00:32:38,029
Hey, l'm hungy.
l've otherthings to do.

429
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:41,129
l'm hungy(ln Hindi).
What have you decided?

430
00:32:44,027 --> 00:32:46,562
How old is he?
The elephant.

431
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,629
-Wait. l'm also coming.
-Where?

432
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,796
Give me the key. l'll drop you
where your cab comes.

433
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:54,862
-And?
-And l'll leave put the scooter back.

434
00:32:54,994 --> 00:32:58,130
No. l can't walk all that
distance in the evening.

435
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,128
Even getting an autorikshaw
is impossible.

436
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:04,598
DearAnumol, l have an emergency.
l'll return it by afternoon.

437
00:33:04,694 --> 00:33:05,227
Where'll you leave the key?

438
00:33:05,494 --> 00:33:08,563
- l'll take the duplicate.
- It's somewhere in the cupboard.

439
00:33:08,661 --> 00:33:11,530
- l don't have the time.
- That's ok. l'll look for it.

440
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:13,896
-Aren't you having breakfast?
- No Ma!

441
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:16,129
- What happened?
- He needs the scooter.

442
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,729
Howwill you go then?

443
00:33:18,227 --> 00:33:20,562
He's saying something
about dropping me...

444
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:23,063
at the company stop and
returning the scooter.

445
00:33:24,094 --> 00:33:25,094
This is the one right?

446
00:33:25,194 --> 00:33:25,894
Yeah.

447
00:33:25,994 --> 00:33:27,195
Give me the helmet.

448
00:33:30,461 --> 00:33:32,796
Please don't return it
without any petrol.

449
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,595
Sheesh! Would anyone
do such a thing?

450
00:33:34,727 --> 00:33:37,529
lfthe petrol finishes, l'll
Ieave it at that point. Okay?

451
00:33:42,527 --> 00:33:43,895
- Didn't she have breakfast?
- No.

452
00:33:44,027 --> 00:33:45,628
He was pestering her!

453
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:48,229
-Where's he going so early?
- No idea!

454
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:50,762
Hope he's not out
to rob someone.

455
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:53,997
You should ty talking
to Kunjumon again.

456
00:33:54,127 --> 00:33:55,428
You know how many
times l've tried!

457
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,229
Remember what he told
Kunjumon the last time?

458
00:33:57,527 --> 00:34:00,663
That was a while back.
He's probably changed his mind.

459
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,465
Let's leave it to chance.
May be his is the right path.

460
00:34:18,527 --> 00:34:19,628
This is the house.

461
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,562
-Aren't you coming in?
- No, Sir.

462
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,696
- It's better that l don't come.
-Why?

463
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,463
They won't feel free
to talk with me around.

464
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,896
-You go.
- Ok.

465
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:40,995
l've sent him in.

466
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:44,762
l'll wait outside.

467
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:46,461
Okay, okay.

468
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:03,195
Parameswara Panickar Sir?

469
00:35:04,127 --> 00:35:07,029
My father's not well.
Is it about the elephant?

470
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,630
-Yes.
- Come in, sit down.

471
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,096
- He's been taken for a bath.
-Will it be long?

472
00:35:16,227 --> 00:35:16,927
No! no!

473
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,729
Are the documents all clear?

474
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:22,030
- My father is up-to-date.
- Do you have a micro chip?

475
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,130
Eveything except a
pollution certificate.

476
00:35:25,261 --> 00:35:27,763
Take a look at the elephant first.
We'll discuss all this later.

477
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:35,628
Come on!

478
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,829
Here. This is our guy!

479
00:35:39,494 --> 00:35:40,695
Can l take a photo?

480
00:35:41,494 --> 00:35:43,095
Yeah you can...
but be careful.

481
00:35:43,194 --> 00:35:44,995
Smile!
Shake your tusk and smile!

482
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:49,229
Dad bought him at an auction from
the forest department when he was mo.

483
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:51,062
He has been with
us ever since then.

484
00:35:51,194 --> 00:35:53,863
Has caused us lots oftrouble.

485
00:35:53,994 --> 00:35:55,695
Right, Rajesh?

486
00:35:55,794 --> 00:35:58,062
We're both the same age.

487
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:03,063
Rajesh, tell him
about his qualities.

488
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,061
Go

489
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:04,727
Come.

490
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,495
He is very gracious.

491
00:36:07,627 --> 00:36:11,597
Look at his body!

492
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:16,064
Look at how long the trunk is.

493
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:18,729
Come touch the trunk and see!

494
00:36:18,861 --> 00:36:20,128
So, what are you expecting?

495
00:36:20,227 --> 00:36:24,464
Nothing less than 85.
It's in great demand.

496
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,462
How is he? Calm?

497
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,096
He has behaved well
for some time now. Vey gentle.

498
00:36:31,227 --> 00:36:32,761
Ho_s he otherwise?

499
00:36:32,894 --> 00:36:35,129
He has chewed up
three people.

500
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:38,831
- Chewed up?
- Sory! Stamped and killed.

501
00:36:38,927 --> 00:36:42,597
l don't beat or correct
him any more.

502
00:36:42,694 --> 00:36:45,797
He's scared of even my shadow!

503
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:51,131
- He's killed three people?
- That was 15 years ago.

504
00:36:51,261 --> 00:36:52,629
So what?

505
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:53,495
What's his name?

506
00:36:53,627 --> 00:36:54,995
Chunkapura Raghavan.
Haven't you heard of him?

507
00:36:55,094 --> 00:36:55,928
Yeah...

508
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:58,195
l know people who
would agree for 50 or 60.

509
00:36:58,461 --> 00:37:01,063
But l've already said..
We won't give him for less than 85.

510
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,030
We expect 90 though.
This elephant is quite unique.

511
00:37:04,994 --> 00:37:07,629
Rajesh, go chain him.
Are you done?

512
00:37:07,761 --> 00:37:08,061
Yeah!

513
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,096
Follow me.

514
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:11,128
Follow me like my shadow.

515
00:37:11,227 --> 00:37:11,994
Sit down.

516
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:15,796
l'll ty my best.

517
00:37:15,927 --> 00:37:18,562
But l don't think anyone
would agree to your price.

518
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:22,130
But it is worth that price.
You just saw it.

519
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:23,061
Yeah...

520
00:37:23,194 --> 00:37:26,096
People also look
into an elephant's histoy.

521
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:29,762
An elephant's price is
not decided based on that.

522
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:32,230
- People will look into eveything.
- No one looks into these things.

523
00:37:32,527 --> 00:37:34,228
l'll try anyway.

524
00:37:34,527 --> 00:37:37,763
You'll have to pay a
service charge now. Just Rs.500.

525
00:37:37,894 --> 00:37:39,862
Afterthe sale, you'll have
to pay us a 20/o commission.

526
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:42,129
- Only ifwe get that price.
-Whatever the price be.

527
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:45,863
lfthe sale happens through
us you'll have to pay us 20/o.

528
00:37:45,994 --> 00:37:47,428
That's how it works.

529
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,163
What about the
elephant's accessories?

530
00:37:50,261 --> 00:37:52,863
-What do you mean?
- l mean, the elephant's accessories.

531
00:37:52,994 --> 00:37:55,029
Only the chain and the
rope. That's all.

532
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,098
What about the Mahout's tools?
The hook, the knife and the like?

533
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,929
Clients will ask me.
That's why.

534
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,764
What about the forehead-ornament...
...the ornamental fan and all?

535
00:38:06,894 --> 00:38:09,062
But that's all rented!

536
00:38:09,194 --> 00:38:12,230
Oh yeah, okay...
l was just asking.

537
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:13,694
Just in case...

538
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,864
- Who's the owner?
- My dad.

539
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:19,562
He's down with a viral fever.

540
00:38:19,694 --> 00:38:20,895
That's why he isn't here.

541
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,062
l need to buy some
lime and jaggey.

542
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,195
l'm vey hungy.

543
00:38:29,227 --> 00:38:31,729
-When's the next festival?
- The season's over.

544
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:33,662
The elephant-festival's
are coming up.

545
00:38:33,794 --> 00:38:34,995
Some inaugurations too.

546
00:38:35,127 --> 00:38:38,129
Please give me 150.Rs.
To buy betel leaf.

547
00:38:38,627 --> 00:38:39,227
Oh God!

548
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,795
500 Rs.

549
00:38:48,027 --> 00:38:51,163
Proceed only if the price is ok.
We're not in a hury.

550
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:55,731
We're in a hury.
Shouldn't delay such things!

551
00:38:55,827 --> 00:38:56,661
Am l right?

552
00:38:57,261 --> 00:38:58,595
Ok then.

553
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:10,861
Sir!

554
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,430
-Are you going to buy this elephant?
-Why?

555
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:16,762
- Do you really need to?
-Why not?

556
00:39:16,894 --> 00:39:19,463
lt's not good to keep at home.

557
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,461
What do you mean?

558
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,732
Soon aRer it was brought here,
Sir died of a heart-attack.

559
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,696
-Which Sir are you talking about?
- That girl's father.

560
00:39:28,794 --> 00:39:29,594
Girl?

561
00:39:29,694 --> 00:39:33,164
The girl you spoke to now.
l'm talking about herfather.

562
00:39:33,461 --> 00:39:37,097
But... she said her father
was lying inside with fever.

563
00:39:37,227 --> 00:39:40,663
She's lying. There is no one
there. She's all alone.

564
00:39:40,794 --> 00:39:41,961
l know it.

565
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,730
But she said that the elephant is
registered in her father's name.

566
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:46,829
Sir, there's no elephant there.

567
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,696
lt's not an elephant.
It's just a soul.

568
00:39:49,827 --> 00:39:51,528
Who? Raghavan?

569
00:39:52,494 --> 00:39:57,599
Could you hearthe chain's
sound when he walked?

570
00:39:58,594 --> 00:39:59,895
Think about it.

571
00:40:00,994 --> 00:40:03,629
You won't hear it.
You can't hear it.

572
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:07,596
- Look again.
- No, no.

573
00:40:07,694 --> 00:40:10,096
l'm telling you the truth.
l'm sure about it.

574
00:40:10,227 --> 00:40:12,829
There are many things that
we don't understand in life.

575
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:14,495
We won't understand
when we're alive.

576
00:40:14,627 --> 00:40:16,762
Even l understood
only after death.

577
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:20,231
-ARer whose death?
- My death!

578
00:40:22,794 --> 00:40:25,096

00:40:25,194 --> 00:40:28,630

581
00:40:31,827 --> 00:40:35,530
Stop there, Sir.
Stop, elephant!

582
00:40:36,627 --> 00:40:37,794
Stop elephant, elephant!

583
00:41:21,527 --> 00:41:22,494
Hello...!

585
00:41:29,694 --> 00:41:31,495

-Yes.

586
00:41:31,594 --> 00:41:33,762
- Can you please call him?
- He's not here.

589
00:41:43,027 --> 00:41:44,928
Are you his father?

590
00:41:45,027 --> 00:41:47,162
Yeah.
Where are you from?

591
00:41:56,628 --> 00:41:57,695
Who's it?

592
00:41:58,128 --> 00:41:59,762
They've come to see Sibi.

593
00:42:06,895 --> 00:42:07,762
Hey!

594
00:42:12,462 --> 00:42:13,162

597
00:42:33,795 --> 00:42:37,565
ls this a cross-examination?
l told you Sibi is not here.

598
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,798
- l've understood.
- Then please leave.

599
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:45,130
Tell him that Ismu had come.

600
00:42:45,228 --> 00:42:47,730
Tell him the name correctly.

601
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,629
Tell it correctly.

602
00:42:53,095 --> 00:42:54,563
Look at me.

00:42:55,161 --> 00:42:56,930
So what's my name?

604
00:42:58,161 --> 00:42:59,463
Say it.

605
00:43:00,762 --> 00:43:02,230
Won't you say it?

lsmu. Say it.

607
00:43:04,928 --> 00:43:06,829
- Say it, you swine!
- Ismu.

608
00:43:06,928 --> 00:43:11,065
Yeah... when your son returns,
tell him this correctly.

609
00:43:19,195 --> 00:43:21,597
Dude, these guys are
from the underworld.

610
00:43:21,728 --> 00:43:24,697
Was he insane to borrow
money from them?

611
00:43:24,828 --> 00:43:26,996
lt's not a small amount.
He has borrowed 1 lakh.

612
00:43:27,128 --> 00:43:28,028
Plus there's interest.

613
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:30,063
Does he know
they went home?

614
00:43:30,195 --> 00:43:32,497
- His phone is switched off as always.
-Yeah right.

615
00:43:32,595 --> 00:43:35,864
- Is his father taking it to the police?
- That's what he says.

616
00:43:35,962 --> 00:43:38,097
Anyway the police
won't do a thing.

617
00:43:38,228 --> 00:43:40,997
- He won't listen.
- Does he knowwhat it's about?

618
00:43:41,128 --> 00:43:42,996
He knom something's
wrong. That's all.

619
00:43:44,928 --> 00:43:47,864
l'll call you back.
Someone's at the door.

620
00:43:57,528 --> 00:43:59,730
- Have you heard?
-What?

621
00:44:00,828 --> 00:44:01,895
Oh that!

622
00:44:02,028 --> 00:44:06,232
They mistook me for someone else.
Ismu called and apologized profusely.

623
00:44:06,495 --> 00:44:10,031
- That's not what people are saying.
-Who are these people?

624
00:44:16,595 --> 00:44:19,597
Your father is planning to
take it to the police.

625
00:44:19,695 --> 00:44:21,496
Have you called home?

626
00:44:22,995 --> 00:44:25,163
Eveyone's frightened.

627
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,897
These guys are trouble.
l'm telling you.

628
00:44:27,995 --> 00:44:30,931
Why do you mix with them?

629
00:44:31,028 --> 00:44:32,863
You betterty getting out of it.

630
00:44:33,995 --> 00:44:36,530
They'll come for you again.

631
00:44:36,661 --> 00:44:39,631
lt could then be worse than this.
So...

632
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:42,764
- So?
- Do something quickly.

633
00:44:42,895 --> 00:44:45,797
There's only one thing to do.
Return the money.

634
00:44:45,928 --> 00:44:47,796
l don't have it.
That's the problem.

635
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:53,765
Next they'll go for your sister.

636
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:56,663
No. They won't.

637
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:00,097
l know howthese
guys operate.

638
00:45:00,228 --> 00:45:04,665
We have recovey teams in our
bank. l deal with them eveyday.

639
00:45:04,762 --> 00:45:08,132
They'll stop at nothing
to get their money back.

640
00:45:08,995 --> 00:45:11,163
- What's to be done?
- Depends on you.

641
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:14,531
What do you think the
underworld will do to me?

642
00:45:17,661 --> 00:45:18,763
l'm leaving.

643
00:45:19,528 --> 00:45:20,996
Going home?

644
00:45:21,895 --> 00:45:24,230
No. l don't feel like it.

645
00:45:24,495 --> 00:45:26,630
Then why the hell
are you going?

646
00:45:26,762 --> 00:45:27,762
l need to.

647
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:30,197
Do you have enough money?
Do you want some?

648
00:45:30,462 --> 00:45:32,597
Why? Do you have
more-than-enough?

649
00:45:32,695 --> 00:45:36,098
Don't talk nonsense!
Do you want some money or not?

650
00:45:36,228 --> 00:45:38,797
Dude, eveyone needs money.

651
00:45:47,561 --> 00:45:48,629
That's all?

652
00:45:48,728 --> 00:45:50,830
l thought you were
getting me out of debt.

653
00:45:50,928 --> 00:45:55,132
You better get out of debt soon...
oryou'll be working in your old age.

654
00:45:55,928 --> 00:45:58,597
Haven't worked now...
forget about old age.

655
00:45:58,728 --> 00:45:59,929
l'll call you.

656
00:46:08,061 --> 00:46:10,964
Selling an elephant
is not easy.

657
00:46:11,095 --> 00:46:12,663
We're not good at it it.

658
00:46:12,762 --> 00:46:14,864
l've enquired thoroughly.
There are people who will help.

659
00:46:14,995 --> 00:46:16,996
They'll take care of eveything.
We needn't wory.

660
00:46:17,128 --> 00:46:19,830

00:46:19,962 --> 00:46:21,596
Please help me.

l need the money.
Please help.

663
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:28,433
You won't make any money
unless the sale happens.

664
00:46:28,561 --> 00:46:31,665
l can't do it.
Look for someone else.

665
00:46:31,762 --> 00:46:34,064
- Let me do one thing.
-What?

666
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:36,063
- Let me come there?
-Why would you come here?

00:46:36,161 --> 00:46:38,797
- l'll tell you once l come.
- Tell me what the matter is.

668
00:46:38,895 --> 00:46:40,129
l'll tell you once l come.

669
00:46:40,228 --> 00:46:42,730
Why can't you tell me

lt'll be clearer
if l come there.

671
00:46:44,895 --> 00:46:47,864
Eveything is quite clear.
There's no confusion.

672
00:46:47,995 --> 00:46:49,029
Please Bhai...

673
00:46:49,661 --> 00:46:50,496
What is it you want?

674
00:46:50,595 --> 00:46:54,065

Why are you putting on such airs?

675
00:46:54,195 --> 00:46:56,463
- Come overthen.
- l'm coming right away.

676
00:46:56,561 --> 00:46:57,729
Don't vanish.

677
00:46:58,095 --> 00:46:58,762
Okay.

678
00:46:59,762 --> 00:47:02,664
What's to come will come
even Ifwe lay a trap on the way.

679
00:47:02,762 --> 00:47:05,731
-Who are you tying to trap?
- Shut up!

680
00:47:08,028 --> 00:47:08,895
Who?

681
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:10,763
The guy who showed us
the gem's photo?

682
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:11,729
Yeah.

683
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:14,063
Didn't we pay him o_ that day?

684
00:47:14,161 --> 00:47:15,129
Well...

685
00:47:15,262 --> 00:47:19,099
- Did he approach us... or?
- He approached us.

686
00:47:19,195 --> 00:47:21,463
Anyway we do need help there.

687
00:47:21,595 --> 00:47:24,731
This guy is sure
to stay for a while.

688
00:47:24,862 --> 00:47:26,463
That we can't be sure of!

689
00:47:26,561 --> 00:47:29,097
He's in a soup.
He will stay.

690
00:47:29,628 --> 00:47:30,595
-ls it?
-Yeah.

691
00:47:31,995 --> 00:47:34,931
An old house in
the midst of a thick forest.

692
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:38,732
No people around,
no phone and no electricity.

693
00:47:39,161 --> 00:47:43,065
Do you have the guts
to stay there alone?

694
00:47:46,161 --> 00:47:47,530
Alone?

695
00:47:47,628 --> 00:47:49,863
Well not completely alone.

696
00:47:49,962 --> 00:47:52,798
What ifyou have
some company there?

697
00:47:54,561 --> 00:47:55,896
l'm not scared.

698
00:47:55,995 --> 00:47:58,797
That's what l'm saying.
You won't be completely alone.

699
00:47:58,895 --> 00:48:00,696
Assume there's another
person there.

700
00:48:00,828 --> 00:48:02,129
Where's this place, Sir?

701
00:48:02,228 --> 00:48:04,730
We bought it recently.

702
00:48:04,862 --> 00:48:07,030
lt was a well maintained plantation.

703
00:48:07,128 --> 00:48:08,863
From the time ofthe king.

704
00:48:08,995 --> 00:48:10,763
Mlamade Palace.

705
00:48:10,895 --> 00:48:13,130
lt's completely run down now.

706
00:48:13,228 --> 00:48:15,463
lt needs restoring.

707
00:48:15,928 --> 00:48:18,463
Can you do it?

708
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:19,729
l'll do it, Sir.

709
00:48:32,595 --> 00:48:34,463
Who's that calling?

710
00:48:34,595 --> 00:48:36,830
Stalin.
He's calling for the raR.

711
00:48:54,061 --> 00:48:56,831
l was hoping you
guys were here.

712
00:48:56,962 --> 00:49:00,565
- There's no use sticking around here.
- Why? Not enough fish?

713
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:02,797
Hardly any.

714
00:49:09,895 --> 00:49:12,831
- Don't you have another oar?
- It's Ok. l'll row.

715
00:49:17,661 --> 00:49:21,132
Hey, l hope there's some
rice to eat? l'm starving.

716
00:49:21,262 --> 00:49:23,464
Been eating this
fortwo days now.

717
00:49:23,595 --> 00:49:24,729
l'm out of grain.

718
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:25,896
What's that?

719
00:49:25,995 --> 00:49:29,598
We've been in Pullumala
forthe last 10-12 days.

720
00:49:29,728 --> 00:49:31,496
-You knowSajeevan Sir?
-Yeah.

721
00:49:31,628 --> 00:49:36,499
He brought two foreigners.
They had two guns and mo porters.

722
00:49:36,595 --> 00:49:38,563
Six people
including me.

723
00:49:38,661 --> 00:49:43,233
They wanted deermeat but
we could get only this beef.

724
00:49:43,495 --> 00:49:44,495
We roasted it.

725
00:49:44,595 --> 00:49:47,564
They took most of it.
The rest we threw in the forest.

726
00:49:47,661 --> 00:49:49,997
The other day wild dogs
caught a deer here.

727
00:49:50,128 --> 00:49:50,695
And?

728
00:49:50,795 --> 00:49:53,898
We chased the dogs away
and grabbed the deer's leg.

729
00:49:53,995 --> 00:49:58,132
-You should've taken it all.
- One leg is more than enough for us.

730
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:00,130
We left some forthe dogs.

731
00:50:00,628 --> 00:50:02,896
No wonderyou guys never prosper.

732
00:50:16,595 --> 00:50:20,231
- Hey Naayo, what's up?
- Nothing much.

733
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:23,431
Oh God! Who's this?
What happened?

734
00:50:23,528 --> 00:50:26,197
lt's Balan. Something bit
him in the forest.

735
00:50:26,462 --> 00:50:29,198
His whole body was itching.
We've applied medicine.

736
00:50:29,495 --> 00:50:31,129
The itching won't subside
if he sits like this.

737
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:34,965
We've put a leaf paste.
He needs to sweat it out.

738
00:50:35,095 --> 00:50:37,163
He'll be alright when
the poison subsides.

739
00:50:37,462 --> 00:50:40,731
- Balan, is the poison subsiding?
- l'm fine.

740
00:50:42,061 --> 00:50:43,763
Get well soon!

741
00:50:46,061 --> 00:50:48,697
l've brought you all something.

742
00:50:48,828 --> 00:50:51,197
Give me a little
and take the rest.

743
00:50:51,462 --> 00:50:53,764
- What's this?
- Some beef.

744
00:50:53,895 --> 00:50:55,630
Beef?
No, no.

745
00:50:55,762 --> 00:50:59,699
We'll be in trouble if
someone finds out.

746
00:50:59,828 --> 00:51:03,097
- They're waiting for a reason.
- But no one will come this way.

747
00:51:03,195 --> 00:51:07,532
Can never say.
Please take this away.

748
00:51:07,628 --> 00:51:08,862
Alright then.

749
00:51:08,995 --> 00:51:11,197
Nothing good is meant
for your lot, anyway.

750
00:51:15,995 --> 00:51:18,464
Hey Kanna,
give me some rice.

751
00:51:30,695 --> 00:51:33,230
Could you take
me to Mlamade Palace?

752
00:51:33,528 --> 00:51:35,596
Thankacha, do you
want to go to Mlamade?

753
00:51:35,695 --> 00:51:36,729
Why don't you go?

754
00:51:36,828 --> 00:51:39,865
- l don't have a spare-tyre.
- Ifyou're lazy, just say so.

755
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:41,764
He'll take you, Sir.

756
00:51:42,263 --> 00:51:45,165
- How much is it to Mlamade palace?
- It's just called a Palace.

757
00:51:45,763 --> 00:51:48,232
lt's a bad road.
Will cost you 600 bucks.

758
00:51:49,629 --> 00:51:52,798
- Howmany kms from here?
-We don't calculate by kms.

759
00:51:52,929 --> 00:51:54,797
lt's a reasonable rate.

760
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,464
-You want to be dropped there?
-Yeah.

761
00:51:57,562 --> 00:51:58,430
Then get in.

762
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:37,829
Sir...

763
00:52:37,963 --> 00:52:39,564
This is the palace.

764
00:52:40,996 --> 00:52:43,231
Pillecha, you have a guest.

765
00:52:44,129 --> 00:52:45,563
Pillecha!

766
00:52:50,562 --> 00:52:51,630
Pillechan!

767
00:52:57,096 --> 00:52:58,230
Pillecha!

768
00:52:59,162 --> 00:53:02,533
- Isn't he here?
- He must be somewhere around.

769
00:53:03,729 --> 00:53:06,198
Must have gone to
Cheenkannipara to buy stuff.

770
00:53:06,496 --> 00:53:06,929
Where's that?

771
00:53:07,029 --> 00:53:09,698
Where you came from...
that's ''Cheenkannipara city''.

772
00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:13,032
- But we didn't see him on the way.
- He probably walked through the forest.

773
00:53:13,129 --> 00:53:15,064
- Forest?
- Yeah, that's easier.

774
00:53:15,162 --> 00:53:17,098
So Pillechan doesn't
knowthat you're coming?

775
00:53:17,196 --> 00:53:17,863
No.

776
00:53:17,996 --> 00:53:20,198
Don't wory. He'll be
back soon. l'm off.

777
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:22,598
Wait. Does he
have a mobile phone?

778
00:53:22,729 --> 00:53:24,430
l don't know

779
00:53:24,529 --> 00:53:25,596
Don't wory, Sir.

780
00:53:25,696 --> 00:53:28,799
l'll send him back
quickly if l see him.

781
00:53:28,929 --> 00:53:30,163
Shall l leave then?

782
00:53:32,829 --> 00:53:34,730
l think l'll also come with you.

783
00:53:34,829 --> 00:53:37,064
What if he doesn't come back?
We don't know.

784
00:53:37,196 --> 00:53:41,199
What if he comes
back while we're on the way?

785
00:53:41,496 --> 00:53:42,864
That's what l meant.

786
00:53:49,496 --> 00:53:51,631
Sir, what should l do?

787
00:53:54,029 --> 00:53:56,231
l'll also come along.

788
00:53:56,529 --> 00:53:57,096
And?

789
00:53:57,863 --> 00:54:01,600
l'll stay in a lodge tonight
and come back tomorrow.

790
00:54:01,729 --> 00:54:06,633
The only Lodge is at Pothupara or
at Mallipetti near Tamil Nadu.

791
00:54:06,763 --> 00:54:11,434
- Isn't there a lodge in Cheenkannipara?
-Who comes here, Sir?

792
00:54:11,529 --> 00:54:13,097
Shall l leave then?

793
00:54:18,196 --> 00:54:19,096
Ok Sir.

794
00:54:19,229 --> 00:54:22,098
Hey please give me
your mobile number.

795
00:54:23,763 --> 00:54:30,503
944-7-8-2-7-1-08

796
00:54:32,062 --> 00:54:34,899
- But you don't get any signal here.
- l'll manage.

797
00:54:36,929 --> 00:54:37,896
Alright then.

798
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:02,729
Sir!

799
00:55:02,829 --> 00:55:04,797
Look who's here!

800
00:55:10,496 --> 00:55:13,432
Where were you?
He was about to leave.

801
00:55:14,696 --> 00:55:16,931
-Who's that?
- Don't you kno_

802
00:55:25,463 --> 00:55:26,797
Who's Balan Pillai?

803
00:55:26,929 --> 00:55:27,796
Me.

804
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:29,864
Then who's Pillechan?

805
00:55:30,562 --> 00:55:31,897
That's also me.

806
00:55:33,162 --> 00:55:34,931
Who are you, Sir?

807
00:55:35,062 --> 00:55:35,997
l'll tell you.

808
00:55:36,129 --> 00:55:39,932
But get me a cup of tea first.
Don't you have any manners.

809
00:55:40,062 --> 00:55:41,697
Pick up my bag.

810
00:55:51,162 --> 00:55:54,733
l already knew about
the transfer of property.

811
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:59,867
But l didn't knowthat l'd been
sold along with the property.

812
00:55:59,963 --> 00:56:01,864
Have you understood what's
written in that document?

813
00:56:01,963 --> 00:56:04,799
-Yeah...
- Keep it. l've another copy.

814
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:06,196
Do you have any doubts?

815
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:13,870
Even if l have, l can ask you.
You're going to be around.

816
00:56:20,263 --> 00:56:22,498
Can we get some workers here?

817
00:56:22,596 --> 00:56:23,830
To do what?

818
00:56:23,929 --> 00:56:26,765
To clean up this place.
It can't remain dirty like this.

819
00:56:26,863 --> 00:56:30,032
l'll cleanup a room
foryou to sleep in.

820
00:56:30,162 --> 00:56:33,065
We don't need anyone for cleaning.

821
00:56:33,196 --> 00:56:38,601
After all, l've looked afterthis
place alone all these years.

822
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:49,067
- Will you have gruel tonight?
-Why? Do you have it evey night?

823
00:56:49,162 --> 00:56:51,698
lt's easy to cook.
That's why.

824
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:57,234
You didn't inform me that you're coming.
l would've cooked something nice.

825
00:56:57,496 --> 00:57:01,900
How is that possible? Think about it. l
myselfwould've had to come and tell you!

826
00:57:02,029 --> 00:57:03,663
That's the problem.

827
00:57:03,763 --> 00:57:06,565
We're so cut off
from the outside world.

828
00:57:06,662 --> 00:57:07,864
ls this teak?

829
00:57:09,662 --> 00:57:10,497
Yes, teak.

830
00:57:11,629 --> 00:57:13,831
lt's damn costly.

831
00:57:13,929 --> 00:57:15,997
See, all this is teak.

832
00:57:16,096 --> 00:57:18,431
My goodness!
It's all teak!

833
00:57:27,963 --> 00:57:29,698
How long have you been here?

834
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:36,235
Swami's father brought
me here as a kid.

835
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:38,965
Would be about
60 years ago.

836
00:57:39,096 --> 00:57:41,832
That's a long time!

837
00:57:41,963 --> 00:57:45,933
l've been through a lot.
But l somehow made it till here.

838
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:51,834
The money dried up
after Swami took ill.

839
00:57:51,929 --> 00:57:57,134
His children don't bother.

840
00:57:57,562 --> 00:58:00,198
There's been no
electricity for 2 years.

841
00:58:00,496 --> 00:58:03,832
They don't even send me
enough money to pay the bills.

842
00:58:03,929 --> 00:58:08,199
You must have seen those
weak tea plants outside.

843
00:58:08,463 --> 00:58:12,466
l survive with the money
l get from selling them.

844
00:58:12,562 --> 00:58:17,467
-Who do you have at home?
- Right now it's only myself and you, Sir.

845
00:58:24,096 --> 00:58:28,033
Dinner's ready. Tell me
when it's time to serve.

846
00:58:28,162 --> 00:58:30,431
So early?Are you hungy?

847
00:58:31,062 --> 00:58:33,632
- l've eaten.
- Oh.

848
00:58:36,863 --> 00:58:37,863
Why are you
standing there?

849
00:58:37,963 --> 00:58:42,767
l usually don't step out after dark.

850
00:58:42,863 --> 00:58:43,830
Why's that?

851
00:58:43,929 --> 00:58:46,464
Just...

852
00:58:46,596 --> 00:58:50,499
- It's surrounded by forest, right?
-Yeah dense forest.

853
00:58:50,629 --> 00:58:53,565
lt's a historical forest.

854
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:57,533
l'll take you for a walk
around in the morning.

855
00:58:57,629 --> 00:58:59,664
Do you get to see
elephants and tigers here?

856
00:58:59,796 --> 00:59:03,966
Yeah we do.
They don't bother us.

857
00:59:04,096 --> 00:59:06,898
But it's not the animals
that we should fear.

858
00:59:07,029 --> 00:59:08,897
Then what should we fear?

859
00:59:09,029 --> 00:59:11,531
Lots of things!

860
00:59:11,629 --> 00:59:16,467
A lot of blood has been shed in
this place. You'll understand slowly.

861
00:59:23,463 --> 00:59:24,797
- Balan Pillai...
-Yeah.

862
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:28,733
- Do you knowwhy l've come here?
-You've told me.

863
00:59:28,863 --> 00:59:31,765
The plan is to
restore this place and...

864
00:59:31,896 --> 00:59:36,033
make it hospitable for people to come
and stay and see the forest.

865
00:59:36,129 --> 00:59:38,231
Our guests are happy!
And we make our money!

866
00:59:38,496 --> 00:59:39,997
- Do you understand?
-Yeah.

867
00:59:40,129 --> 00:59:44,733
lfyou spread these scay stories,
business will be affected.

868
00:59:44,863 --> 00:59:46,764
That's not what l meant.

869
00:59:46,896 --> 00:59:51,567
The stoy is well known
around here. It's not only me.

870
00:59:51,662 --> 00:59:53,564
Whose blood?
What are you talking about?

871
00:59:53,662 --> 00:59:57,133
Long ago, when Tipu's
army was entering,

872
00:59:57,263 --> 01:00:00,933
our king needed to hide his
gold and other possessions.

873
01:00:01,029 --> 01:00:10,171
He struck a deal with Madurai Nayakkar,
to move 101 loads of gold to Tamil Nadu.

874
01:00:10,263 --> 01:00:12,832
The plan was to
carry it through this forest.

875
01:00:12,963 --> 01:00:15,031
Thejourney is 4-5 days by foot.

876
01:00:15,129 --> 01:00:20,834
101 tribals, porters and
some soldiers set off.

877
01:00:20,963 --> 01:00:24,166
Not one was seen afterthat.

878
01:00:25,562 --> 01:00:30,100
Legend goes, that the porters were
beheaded, 8the gold hidden in the forest.

879
01:00:30,229 --> 01:00:33,465
The ones who beheaded
the tribals also disappeared.

880
01:00:35,929 --> 01:00:39,766
- So what about the gold?
- They say it's in the forest.

881
01:00:40,829 --> 01:00:43,231
101 loads of gold!
That's hell of a lot.

882
01:00:43,529 --> 01:00:46,164
Anyway it's just a stoy!
The numbers can be as we please.

883
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:49,232
No, this is notjust a stoy.
There's historical evidence.

884
01:00:49,529 --> 01:00:51,530
Find out ifyou want to.

885
01:00:51,662 --> 01:00:53,531
What's this place?

886
01:00:53,662 --> 01:00:54,964
Thalakaani.

887
01:00:55,062 --> 01:00:58,132
Even if it were true, someone must
have taken away the gold long time ago.

888
01:00:58,229 --> 01:01:01,432
No one has touched it.
It's still there.

889
01:01:01,529 --> 01:01:03,764
You mean, It's still lying
there after all these years?

890
01:01:03,896 --> 01:01:06,732
Lots of people have
gone looking.

891
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:10,233
-And?
- None have returned.

892
01:01:10,496 --> 01:01:13,498
The treasure is
guarded even today.

893
01:01:13,596 --> 01:01:16,565
- By whom?
- 101 headless tribals.

894
01:01:17,529 --> 01:01:20,665
That's why it's called Thalakaani.

895
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:35,431
Get me some water, Balan Pillai.

896
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,064
Balan Pillai!!!

897
01:01:39,563 --> 01:01:42,466
- What happened, Sir?
-Where were you?

898
01:01:42,563 --> 01:01:46,234
l was making your
bed. What happened, Sir?

899
01:01:46,497 --> 01:01:48,999
l wanted some water.
Anyway, never mind.

900
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:51,632
lt's vey cold outside.
l'll sit inside.

901
01:02:03,264 --> 01:02:04,632
Pillecha!

902
01:02:07,764 --> 01:02:10,233
- Isn't Pillechan here?
- No. Anything urgent?

903
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:13,032
No. l just dropped in
while passing by.

904
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,664
He'll be late.

905
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:17,933
Thankachan told me
about you.

906
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:21,233
l live near Cheenkannipara.
The name is Stalin.

907
01:02:22,464 --> 01:02:25,066
You're starting a resort here?

908
01:02:25,163 --> 01:02:29,601
-A resort? Who told you?
- l heard.

909
01:02:29,697 --> 01:02:32,599
l'm willing to take people
around the forest.

910
01:02:32,697 --> 01:02:36,434
We're not starting a resort.
Just something small.

911
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:39,499
No on knom about this place.

912
01:02:39,597 --> 01:02:41,999
People will flow in
ifthey know.

913
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:46,167
-What do you do, Stalin?
- l don't have a permanentjob.

914
01:02:46,464 --> 01:02:49,133
But you said you take
people around the forest.

915
01:02:49,264 --> 01:02:52,834
l was brought up here.
So l knowthe place well.

916
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:55,165
We live depending
on the forest.

917
01:02:55,264 --> 01:02:59,968
Let me knowwhen you're free.
We'll take a walk around.

918
01:03:00,063 --> 01:03:03,967
The sceney around here is great for
photography. Do you have a camera?

919
01:03:04,063 --> 01:03:06,499
- No l don't.
-A mobile phone will do.

920
01:03:06,597 --> 01:03:08,231
There's no signal
for my phone here.

921
01:03:08,497 --> 01:03:11,766
Balan Pillai walked me up the
mountains and still no signal.

922
01:03:11,897 --> 01:03:13,598
What connection do you have?
Is it BSNL?

923
01:03:13,697 --> 01:03:16,433
- IDEA.
- Pillechan has no idea.

924
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,965
You need to go on
top ofthat mountain.

925
01:03:19,097 --> 01:03:21,532
You'll get signal there.
Do you want to go no_

926
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:22,130
l'll take you.

927
01:03:22,264 --> 01:03:24,799
There's no electricity.
l haven't charged my phone.

928
01:03:24,897 --> 01:03:28,934
Here, put your sim card into
my phone. It's fully charged.

929
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:33,133
lt's old
But vey clear.

930
01:03:33,264 --> 01:03:37,167
Do one thing, write eveything
down on a piece of paper.

931
01:03:37,264 --> 01:03:39,633
When the MD comes,
you can tell him directly.

932
01:03:39,764 --> 01:03:41,132
l'm noting down eveything.

933
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:43,198
l'm not asking for too much.

934
01:03:43,464 --> 01:03:45,966
But at least 2-3 people
should be able to stay here.

935
01:03:46,063 --> 01:03:48,666
The bathroom is a problem.
And the electricity.

936
01:03:48,797 --> 01:03:51,733
The MD will be here
after the 8th.

937
01:03:51,864 --> 01:03:53,165
Call me ifyou need
anything before that.

938
01:03:53,264 --> 01:03:54,832
l've been tying to
call you since l got here.

939
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:58,167
- There's no signal.
- How did you get signal no_

940
01:03:58,464 --> 01:04:00,032
By luck.

941
01:04:00,163 --> 01:04:04,167
- Go to Muthalapara and call.
- Not Muthalappara. Cheenkannipara.

942
01:04:04,464 --> 01:04:05,932
Have to walk 2 hours
to get there.

943
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:08,766
,
Dear son, where there's a will
there's a way.

944
01:04:08,864 --> 01:04:11,032
l'll take care of it.

945
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:13,232
What about this month's salay?

946
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:14,931
- Hello...
- Hello!

947
01:04:17,163 --> 01:04:19,065
- Can you hear me?
-What?

948
01:04:19,663 --> 01:04:20,898
- It's gone.
- Gone!

949
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:22,898
You lost signal?

950
01:04:22,997 --> 01:04:25,432
- l'm glad l could talk.
-Are you done?

951
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:26,130
Yeah.

952
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:30,433
The signal comes from there.
It is lost vey easily.

953
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:31,964
ls that Tamil Nadu?

954
01:04:32,097 --> 01:04:33,932
That's all Tamil Nadu.

955
01:04:34,063 --> 01:04:36,833
One can reach Tamil Nadu
through the forest, that way.

956
01:04:36,964 --> 01:04:38,532
lt a 34 day walk.

957
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:40,531
- So where do you sleep at night?
- In the forest.

958
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:41,831
-ls it?
-Yeah.

959
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:48,966
- Have you been there?
- l've been to evey forest here.

960
01:04:49,063 --> 01:04:53,034
-Why do you go?
- People have different needs.

961
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:58,067
- Do you want to go?
- l don't want to go without a reason.

962
01:04:58,163 --> 01:05:01,233
lt's easy here. The Forest
department doesn't bother us.

963
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,065
-What can they do?
- They don't permit anyone in.

964
01:05:04,163 --> 01:05:06,065
- Don't you knowthat?
- Hmm.

965
01:05:06,697 --> 01:05:09,933
That's not a problem here.
We can go where we want.

966
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:12,798
Can we go to Thalakaani?

967
01:05:14,063 --> 01:05:16,199
Haven't you heard of it?
Thalakaani?

968
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:36,565
lt's true. He has
been to evey forest.

969
01:05:36,697 --> 01:05:38,832
- But...
- But what?

970
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:41,232
- He's ajinx.
-Why?

971
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:47,235
His mother, Thookkupalam Thankamani
is quite famous around these parts.

972
01:05:47,497 --> 01:05:51,767
But no one knom
who his father is.

973
01:05:51,897 --> 01:05:53,064
How can that be his fault?

974
01:05:53,163 --> 01:05:56,433
l was just saying.

975
01:06:00,097 --> 01:06:00,997
Done?

976
01:06:02,264 --> 01:06:03,431
l've had enough.

977
01:06:04,163 --> 01:06:05,532
Balan Pillai...

978
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:09,767
l casually asked
Stalin about Thalakaani.

979
01:06:09,864 --> 01:06:12,233
- What did he say?
- He seemed uninterested.

980
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:15,833
That's what l said.
No one goes there.

981
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,531
He's pretending to be scared.

982
01:06:17,663 --> 01:06:20,433
He changed his mind as soon as he
realized that it won't work with me.

983
01:06:20,563 --> 01:06:22,532
Now he's willing to go anytime.

984
01:06:22,663 --> 01:06:25,099
- Did he say so?
-Yes.

985
01:06:25,197 --> 01:06:27,465
You're new here.

986
01:06:27,597 --> 01:06:33,970
What if he takes you to some
mountaintop and say it's Thalakaani.

987
01:06:34,097 --> 01:06:38,201
You'll have to believe it.
It's not a place for men to go.

988
01:06:38,464 --> 01:06:40,532
Why would you
want to go there?

989
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:42,598
l want to see ifyour
stories are true.

990
01:06:42,697 --> 01:06:44,598
Why would l lie?

991
01:06:44,697 --> 01:06:47,132
So there's a lot of
gold in Thalakaani.

992
01:06:48,964 --> 01:06:52,033
Why not go and see?

993
01:06:52,163 --> 01:06:56,134
Remember, you're not the first
one to get this idea.

994
01:06:56,264 --> 01:07:00,001
People have tried before.

995
01:07:00,097 --> 01:07:02,799
l personally know of an incident.

996
01:07:02,897 --> 01:07:07,534
Didn't want to scare
you with these stories.

997
01:07:07,663 --> 01:07:11,200
Success comes only after
a series offailure, right?

998
01:07:11,464 --> 01:07:15,835
Even a tiger makes a kill
only after tying and failing ten times.

999
01:07:15,964 --> 01:07:18,733
l was talking
about human beings.

1000
01:07:18,864 --> 01:07:21,166
Tell me when
it's time for dinner.

1001
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:39,100
Tipu died in the year 973.

1002
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:42,132
We've got a palm leaf
from 3 years before that.

1003
01:07:42,264 --> 01:07:44,099
ln 970.

1004
01:07:44,197 --> 01:07:50,469
lt clearly states that grain
for 101 soldiers and porters,

1005
01:07:50,597 --> 01:07:55,468
will be sent to a nearby temple,
and was not to be used by anyone else.

1006
01:07:55,563 --> 01:07:56,865
Are you a Hindu?

1007
01:07:56,997 --> 01:07:57,564
No, no.

1008
01:07:57,663 --> 01:07:58,631
Shucks!

1009
01:07:59,663 --> 01:08:01,132
You're not allowed
to enter the temple.

1010
01:08:02,264 --> 01:08:05,600
l could've showed you
the leaf. It's still there.

1011
01:08:05,697 --> 01:08:07,765
So it's a true stoy.

1012
01:08:07,864 --> 01:08:08,598
Yeah.

1013
01:08:09,663 --> 01:08:11,699
So is the treasure still there?

1014
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:15,734
The gold was safely carried
from here. We have proof.

1015
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:17,598
But it didn't reach anywhere.

1016
01:08:17,697 --> 01:08:21,700
So we can be sure
that it was lost in the forest.

1017
01:08:23,797 --> 01:08:27,500
ls the stoy
about Thalakaani true?

1018
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:30,199
Tribals tell that stoy.
It must be true.

1019
01:08:30,464 --> 01:08:32,566
lt's where their ancestors
were betrayed and murdered.

1020
01:08:32,697 --> 01:08:37,034
They still don't go there.
They don't even utter the name.

1021
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:38,197
lt's completely forbidden!

1022
01:08:38,464 --> 01:08:42,568
l'm sure something
big happened there.

1023
01:08:42,663 --> 01:08:45,033
- Many people died.
- Have you been there?

1024
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:47,032
Why do you want to go?

1025
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:51,931
You're not interested
in this, are you?

1026
01:08:52,064 --> 01:08:54,966
- Intesrseted in what?
- The treasure in the forest.

1027
01:08:55,997 --> 01:08:57,098
What if it's true?

1028
01:08:57,230 --> 01:08:59,599
l don't have such desires.

1029
01:08:59,697 --> 01:09:02,699
Nonsense! Eveyone has desires.
They just don't say it!

1030
01:09:02,797 --> 01:09:05,833
l'm happy as l am.

1031
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:07,765
l don't want anything more.

1032
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:04,564
Balan Chetta!

1033
01:10:05,163 --> 01:10:08,200
What a pleasant surprise!
Where are you coming from?

1034
01:10:08,464 --> 01:10:11,200
l was wandering about here, so
thought of coming and visiting you.

1035
01:10:12,264 --> 01:10:13,164
Who is that?

1036
01:10:13,897 --> 01:10:17,600
He's our new manager.

1037
01:10:17,697 --> 01:10:19,165
Manager? But why?

1038
01:10:19,464 --> 01:10:22,967
Someone else bought
this place recently.

1039
01:10:23,064 --> 01:10:27,034
When Swami passed away,
his children sold it.

1040
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:30,566
-When did Swami pass away?
- It's over a year now.

1041
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:34,432
So l've to get his permission
to stay here no_

1042
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,098
Don't wory. Come.

1043
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:41,632
lt's alright. Come on dear.
Come.

1044
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:48,166
She's an old guest.

1045
01:10:48,264 --> 01:10:51,800
Hi, l'm Sameera.
l come here often.

1046
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:53,865
l guessed, when
you barged in.

1047
01:10:53,997 --> 01:10:55,965
N4 name is Sibi.

1048
01:10:56,097 --> 01:10:59,233
l didn't knowabout the changes.
That's why. l'm sory.

1049
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:00,764
That's alright.

1050
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:03,766
You're our first guest.
Right, Balan Pillai?

1051
01:11:03,863 --> 01:11:06,166
Balan Chetta, there are
some groceries in the vehicle.

1052
01:11:06,465 --> 01:11:08,200
- Could you please bring it in?
-Yeah.

1053
01:11:12,631 --> 01:11:15,433
N4 plan is to renovate
and restore this place.

1054
01:11:15,565 --> 01:11:16,565
You'll have to put up with
it this one more time.

1055
01:11:16,698 --> 01:11:18,766
There'll be more facilities
the next time you visit.

1056
01:11:18,898 --> 01:11:24,136
That means l'll have
to pay next time.

1057
01:11:24,231 --> 01:11:26,866
You needn't pay this time.

1058
01:11:29,631 --> 01:11:31,199
Where will she sleep?

1059
01:11:32,031 --> 01:11:35,901
She used to sleep in
the room you're using now.

1060
01:11:36,031 --> 01:11:39,534
- But you've taken it now.
- Then l'll move out.

1061
01:11:39,631 --> 01:11:42,066
That's not necessay, Sir.
She's not bothered.

1062
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:44,066
She'll sleep anywhere.

1063
01:11:44,198 --> 01:11:48,135
There's a lot of space here.
She won't be here for long.

1064
01:11:48,265 --> 01:11:51,234
Please ask her if
she needs the room.

1065
01:11:51,531 --> 01:11:54,634
Forget it. You needn't
move from there.

1066
01:12:00,498 --> 01:12:03,200
l knewyou would
be a photographer.

1067
01:12:03,465 --> 01:12:06,067
- l'm not a photographer.
- Really?

1068
01:12:06,164 --> 01:12:09,568
l'm neither a photographer
nor a researcher nor a scientist.

1069
01:12:09,664 --> 01:12:10,632
Don't wory.

1070
01:12:10,731 --> 01:12:13,600
So you'rejust a
nature lover like me.

1071
01:12:13,698 --> 01:12:14,432
No.

1072
01:12:14,864 --> 01:12:15,565
Then?

1073
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:18,900
l am a...
Junglejunkee!

1074
01:12:28,664 --> 01:12:31,801
- Can hearthe elephants..
-Where? Outside?

1075
01:12:31,898 --> 01:12:33,933
Yeah... somewhere on
the opposite mountain.

1076
01:12:34,031 --> 01:12:36,666
Yeah. It was a distant sound.

1077
01:12:52,231 --> 01:12:54,900
Wow! This is cool.
Eveything sounds di_erent.

1078
01:13:03,531 --> 01:13:05,532
Do you hear something?

1079
01:13:05,898 --> 01:13:06,999
Not really.

1080
01:13:09,131 --> 01:13:12,434
What did you say earlier?
Jungee... junglee?

1081
01:13:13,531 --> 01:13:14,865
Does it mean you
go into the forest?

1082
01:13:14,965 --> 01:13:17,233
Sheesh! l was just kidding.

1083
01:13:17,965 --> 01:13:20,500
l really wish to go to the forest.

1084
01:13:20,631 --> 01:13:23,200
What's the big deal?
You can go anytime.

1085
01:13:24,031 --> 01:13:26,633
But l need someone with me.

1086
01:13:26,765 --> 01:13:30,068
- Balan Chettan's there right?
- No way!

1087
01:13:30,898 --> 01:13:34,901
How about putting in an Ad in a
newspaper asking for a companion.

1088
01:13:35,031 --> 01:13:36,899
You're sure to find someone.

1089
01:13:51,998 --> 01:13:54,066
My goodness!
Are you going to sleep here?

1090
01:13:54,198 --> 01:13:56,466
- l love it here.
- No. No. You should sleep inside.

1091
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,033
- Don't be scared.
- l'm not scared.

1092
01:13:59,131 --> 01:14:01,132
There's a lot of room inside.
Don't sleep alone.

1093
01:14:01,231 --> 01:14:02,532
Hey! Wait! Wait, Wait!

1094
01:14:02,664 --> 01:14:04,800
Are you worried because
l'm sleeping alone?

1095
01:14:04,931 --> 01:14:07,600
Then you sleep here too.

1096
01:14:07,731 --> 01:14:10,700
l have one more sleeping
bag. Do you want it?

1097
01:14:10,831 --> 01:14:14,501
We can look up at the sky and stars
and sleep. Do you want to sleep here?

1098
01:14:15,565 --> 01:14:17,767
l don't want you
to sleep alone.

1099
01:14:18,864 --> 01:14:19,765
Okay.

1100
01:14:21,631 --> 01:14:24,734
l'll just tell Balan Pilla and come.

1101
01:14:55,765 --> 01:14:57,133
Get me some water.

1102
01:14:57,231 --> 01:14:59,032
We're sleeping outside.
Just forfun.

1103
01:14:59,164 --> 01:15:01,534
lt'll be vey cold outside.

1104
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:05,034
You go to sleep.
Just shut the door, don't lock it.

1105
01:15:05,164 --> 01:15:06,065
Okay.

1106
01:15:12,931 --> 01:15:15,800
-Are there mosquitos?
-We won't feel it because we're outside.

1107
01:15:15,898 --> 01:15:18,900
- Here! Rub this on.
- No, mosquitoes don't bite me.

1108
01:15:18,998 --> 01:15:21,800
They bite you.
But you don't know it.

1109
01:15:30,231 --> 01:15:33,033
ls this the first time
you're sleeping outside?

1110
01:15:33,131 --> 01:15:37,802
l've slept on the church
ground during festival.

1111
01:15:38,731 --> 01:15:39,932
Where's your church?

1112
01:15:40,065 --> 01:15:42,500
Paiga RC church in Pala.
Do you know it?

1113
01:15:42,598 --> 01:15:44,599
No, no. l was just asking.

1114
01:15:48,164 --> 01:15:52,836
-What do you think about our project.
- Do it well.

1115
01:15:52,931 --> 01:15:54,432
Of course.

1116
01:15:54,565 --> 01:15:56,934
l'm hoping you'll hep me.

1117
01:15:57,931 --> 01:15:59,666
We need a USP.

1118
01:15:59,765 --> 01:16:02,801
We should give the
guests a new experience.

1119
01:16:03,631 --> 01:16:07,701
We're aiming at high-end clients.
We'll charge them 10,OOO and above.

1120
01:16:07,831 --> 01:16:12,001
But there should be good facilities.
We're looking for foreigners.

1121
01:16:12,965 --> 01:16:15,934
They should feel adventurous.

1122
01:16:16,065 --> 01:16:19,501
We'll take them trekking,
and bird watching.

1123
01:16:19,598 --> 01:16:22,500
They'll be happy.
That's the plan.

1124
01:16:23,631 --> 01:16:25,666
l hope you'll help me.

1125
01:16:30,198 --> 01:16:31,098
Hey!

1126
01:16:31,231 --> 01:16:33,700
l hope you'll help me.

1127
01:16:36,265 --> 01:16:37,666
Hmm...

1128
01:17:05,098 --> 01:17:07,667
- What happened, Sir?
-You've not gone to bed?

1129
01:17:07,765 --> 01:17:11,034
l warned you it will
be cold outside.

1130
01:17:11,164 --> 01:17:13,967
She's used to it.
But you're not.

1131
01:17:14,098 --> 01:17:16,133
l came to tell you something.

1132
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:19,001
You need to go to
Cheenkannipara.

1133
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:22,100
Just tell me when
to go. Okay?

1134
01:17:22,731 --> 01:17:23,098
Ok.

1135
01:17:57,531 --> 01:17:58,164
Pillecha!

1136
01:18:02,031 --> 01:18:03,565
Has the resort been named?

1137
01:18:03,698 --> 01:18:07,868
Don't come there using my name.
l knowyou're coming to see him.

1138
01:18:07,965 --> 01:18:11,468
-You want to give me a bad name?
- l thought l'd give you some publicity.

1139
01:18:11,565 --> 01:18:14,501
Things are going well now.

1140
01:18:14,598 --> 01:18:16,933
You needn't come there
for the sake of my publicity.

1141
01:18:17,065 --> 01:18:22,470
Why are you angy with me?
As if l've made a big mistake.

1142
01:18:22,565 --> 01:18:27,036
Look l've to shave my beard
before Chandran closes shop.

1143
01:18:27,164 --> 01:18:29,867
But he doesn't open
his shop on Tuesdays.

1144
01:18:29,998 --> 01:18:31,566
Today's Tuesday?

1145
01:18:31,664 --> 01:18:33,933
Yesterday was Monday.
So today is Tuesday.

1146
01:18:34,065 --> 01:18:35,933
Have you set out
to ruin my day?

1147
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:39,934
You'll tire yourself out
walking up to there!

1148
01:18:40,031 --> 01:18:44,168
Getting in my way unnecessarily!
When l knowtoday's a beautiful Wednesday.

1149
01:18:44,465 --> 01:18:46,166
Trouble-maker!

1150
01:18:50,698 --> 01:18:54,535
Drink it while it's warm.
You'll feel better after you sweat.

1151
01:18:56,265 --> 01:18:58,767
You're not used to
sleeping in the cold.

1152
01:19:00,531 --> 01:19:03,734
-Aren't you going to Cheenkannipara?
- l've already been.

1153
01:19:04,498 --> 01:19:07,000
- Did you do it?
- Do what?

1154
01:19:07,131 --> 01:19:10,133
- Then why did you go?
-You asked me to go.

1155
01:19:10,265 --> 01:19:12,500
l had a shave as well.

1156
01:19:14,164 --> 01:19:14,999
Take this too.

1157
01:19:15,931 --> 01:19:17,866
Sleep for a while more.

1158
01:19:17,965 --> 01:19:20,734
Take one more tablet aRer lunch.

1159
01:19:21,598 --> 01:19:24,734
He's not fit forthese things.

1160
01:19:24,831 --> 01:19:30,870
He's planning to go to Thalakaani.
l didn't want to tell you.

1161
01:19:31,698 --> 01:19:34,734
- How did he come to know about it?
- Everyone knom it.

1162
01:19:34,864 --> 01:19:36,967
Even l told him.

1163
01:19:37,664 --> 01:19:41,201
There's a reckless guy nearby.
He's the one who's persuaded him.

1164
01:19:42,231 --> 01:19:45,934
lf he asks you, tell him
that you don't know anything.

1165
01:19:46,065 --> 01:19:47,933
Let's also not talk about it.

1166
01:19:48,731 --> 01:19:50,499
He looks like a harmless guy.

1167
01:19:50,598 --> 01:19:53,600
May be.
He's ambitious.

1168
01:19:53,698 --> 01:19:57,435
But not capable of anything.
Look at him lying there.

1169
01:19:58,631 --> 01:19:59,832
Some people are like that.

1170
01:20:16,898 --> 01:20:21,836
''Far off
In a dark-blue land''

1171
01:20:21,965 --> 01:20:33,476
''Does honey drip
from the nightingale's song?''

1172
01:21:03,499 --> 01:21:05,067
''Far off
In a dark-blue land''

1173
01:21:05,165 --> 01:21:11,238
''Does honey drip
from the nightingale's song?''

1174
01:21:18,865 --> 01:21:22,169
''At the bottom of high mountains where
Chains of clouds descend into the forest''

1175
01:21:22,466 --> 01:21:26,670
''Are there wild honey flowers?''

1176
01:21:34,165 --> 01:21:37,636
''Within the limits ofthe
dark silent sky''

1177
01:21:37,766 --> 01:21:42,737

l would apply ifyou put an ad.

1201
01:24:24,599 --> 01:24:26,100
Why don't you ty?

1202
01:24:27,099 --> 01:24:29,935
- l was just kidding that day.
-Alright then!

1203
01:24:32,632 --> 01:24:33,599
Hey...

1204
01:24:34,599 --> 01:24:36,434
Are you serious about it?

1205
01:24:38,632 --> 01:24:39,699
You crack a lot ofjokes.

1206
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:43,467
What does this mean?
Call me Sameera.

1207
01:24:43,566 --> 01:24:44,133
Tell me.

1208
01:24:45,132 --> 01:24:51,071
Sameera, are you serious
orjust teasing me?

1209
01:24:51,899 --> 01:24:52,866
What do you think?

1210
01:24:54,499 --> 01:24:55,800
l'd like to go.

1211
01:24:56,665 --> 01:24:58,567
- Will you come with me?
-Where?

1212
01:24:59,132 --> 01:25:01,133
lt's a dense forest.

1213
01:25:01,232 --> 01:25:02,967
Have you heard of Thalakaani?

1214
01:25:03,066 --> 01:25:04,200
Shhhhh!

1215
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:05,533
Come here.

1216
01:25:12,732 --> 01:25:14,233
Spotted deer.

1217
01:25:14,499 --> 01:25:16,734
lt's the first time l'm
seeing them here.

1218
01:25:16,865 --> 01:25:21,070
l haven't seen them in a long time.
They're rare.

1219
01:25:22,132 --> 01:25:23,666
lt's a good omen.

1220
01:25:27,532 --> 01:25:31,035
- Have you heard of Mareejan?
-Who's that?

1221
01:25:31,766 --> 01:25:33,000
-What about you, dear?
- No.

1222
01:25:33,132 --> 01:25:37,769
Spotted deer are
also called Mareejan.

1223
01:25:37,865 --> 01:25:41,002
lt's from the Ramayanam.
Haven't you heard of it?

1224
01:25:42,532 --> 01:25:45,501
Balan Chetta, where is Thalakaani?

1225
01:25:45,632 --> 01:25:48,701
l haven't been there.
It's far away.

1226
01:25:48,832 --> 01:25:51,034
No one goes there, dear.

1227
01:25:51,132 --> 01:25:55,236
l like going to places
where no one goes.

1228
01:25:56,066 --> 01:25:58,535
Sameera!
Another Mareejan!

1229
01:26:03,832 --> 01:26:06,734
lt'll take us 3 days
to get to Paandipath.

1230
01:26:06,832 --> 01:26:10,202
After camping there we can
go anywhere we want.

1231
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:13,568
- Howfar is Thalakaani from Paandipath?
- Not vey far.

1232
01:26:13,665 --> 01:26:15,901
- Then let's camp out at Thalakaani.
- No Sir.

1233
01:26:15,999 --> 01:26:18,167
Paandipath is a better
place to spend the night.

1234
01:26:18,466 --> 01:26:22,203
- Water is easily available there.
- We need water.

1235
01:26:22,499 --> 01:26:24,200
That's what l'm saying.

1236
01:26:24,499 --> 01:26:27,235
So that's 6 days to and fro.

1237
01:26:27,532 --> 01:26:30,201
You decide howmany more
days you want to stay.

1238
01:26:31,032 --> 01:26:33,134
We can't say that without
seeing the place.

1239
01:26:33,232 --> 01:26:35,534
-Approximately?
-Approximately...

1240
01:26:36,165 --> 01:26:37,500
54 days.

1241
01:26:37,599 --> 01:26:40,802
We'll have to cary food.

1242
01:26:40,932 --> 01:26:43,501
We'll buy eveything.
Don't wory.

1243
01:26:43,599 --> 01:26:46,535
Things can be bought.
But howwill we cary it all?

1244
01:26:46,632 --> 01:26:49,034
l knowa boy.
We'll take him along.

1245
01:26:49,165 --> 01:26:50,967
- l don't want many people.
-We need people.

1246
01:26:51,099 --> 01:26:53,034
lt's hard to
cary such a load.

1247
01:26:53,165 --> 01:26:56,202
There won't be anyone
to help in the forest.

1248
01:26:57,066 --> 01:26:59,234
-Who's the boy?
- He stays nearby.

1249
01:26:59,999 --> 01:27:02,167
Do we need to cary all this?
Won't we get anything in the forest?

1250
01:27:02,466 --> 01:27:05,135
- Ifyou have a gun.
- That's not what l meant.

1251
01:27:05,232 --> 01:27:08,635
-What about fruits or vegetables?
-You'll knowwhen you get there.

1252
01:27:09,665 --> 01:27:12,001
There forest holds eveything.

1253
01:27:12,099 --> 01:27:16,136
But nothing's within our reach.

1254
01:27:16,232 --> 01:27:17,199
Forget it.

1255
01:27:17,466 --> 01:27:20,168
Howmuch grain
do you think we'll need?

1256
01:27:20,266 --> 01:27:23,969
Five people,
about 1 kg per meal.

1257
01:27:24,099 --> 01:27:26,734
That'll be a lot.

1258
01:27:27,266 --> 01:27:29,468
- There's something else we need too.
-What?

1259
01:27:30,099 --> 01:27:32,968
- Money!
-Yeah...

1260
01:27:33,099 --> 01:27:35,768
- Of course we need money.
- Of course.

1261
01:27:39,532 --> 01:27:40,599
Who's this lady?

1262
01:27:41,566 --> 01:27:44,201
Sir, l've somehowconvinced her.

1263
01:27:44,499 --> 01:27:48,536
She's an accredited international
scout for nature tourism.

1264
01:27:48,665 --> 01:27:49,233
Scout?

1265
01:27:49,532 --> 01:27:53,936
She discovers tourist spots
and tells tourist companies.

1266
01:27:54,032 --> 01:27:57,502
lf she writes on the internet there'll
be no stopping the tourists.

1267
01:27:57,599 --> 01:27:58,933
lt will benefit us.

1268
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:02,736
- But why do you need 25 thousand?
- It will cost that much.

1269
01:28:03,266 --> 01:28:05,968
We should have an idea
about the money.

1270
01:28:06,099 --> 01:28:10,069
The sleeping bags and tents that
we buy nowcan be used again.

1271
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:12,000
So it's as an investment.

1272
01:28:12,132 --> 01:28:16,870
We need to pay a guide,
porters...

1273
01:28:16,966 --> 01:28:18,000
lt will cost that much.

1274
01:28:18,132 --> 01:28:21,101
- Is there any chance?
- That l'll have to ask her.

1275
01:28:21,232 --> 01:28:23,000
Shucks!
That's not what l meant.

1276
01:28:23,099 --> 01:28:25,935
Will it reach people
through the internet?

1277
01:28:26,032 --> 01:28:29,869
- Of course.
- Then go get it done.

1278
01:28:29,966 --> 01:28:31,100
Come here!

1279
01:28:32,566 --> 01:28:35,702
Hope you're not planning
to chill out at our expense.

1280
01:28:35,832 --> 01:28:36,999
- Never.
- Okay.

1281
01:28:37,266 --> 01:28:42,237
Äè11ÿå 15ÿå 17ÿå 19ÿå 21 ...,Äè
11, 15, 17, 19, 21...

1282
01:28:42,499 --> 01:28:43,700
This is 25.

1283
01:28:43,832 --> 01:28:44,966
That's what you asked for.

1284
01:28:45,099 --> 01:28:47,067
-What about your commission?
-What?

1285
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:48,567
You don't want it?

1286
01:28:49,466 --> 01:28:53,636
Note it down in my account.
l'll collect it later.

1287
01:28:53,732 --> 01:28:54,966
No. No.
You must keep it.

1288
01:28:55,099 --> 01:28:56,967
Get offwith you.

1289
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:00,800
Playing around!

1290
01:29:13,899 --> 01:29:17,068
-Whom is this medicine for?
-Your mom is sick.

1291
01:29:17,165 --> 01:29:20,035
She was at Pulikkan's for a week.
There's a lot of medicine.

1292
01:29:20,132 --> 01:29:22,567
lsn't it available there?

1293
01:29:22,665 --> 01:29:24,734
lt's cheaper here.

1294
01:29:25,865 --> 01:29:27,567
Then you should've
asked Anumol to come.

1295
01:29:27,665 --> 01:29:30,502
- She has to go to work.
- Then you should've asked Santhosh.

1296
01:29:30,599 --> 01:29:32,834
He is busy with his wedding.

1297
01:29:32,966 --> 01:29:35,601
Moreover he's not the one
who should be doing all this.

1298
01:29:36,266 --> 01:29:38,601
l'll come back aftertwo days.

1299
01:29:39,032 --> 01:29:41,067
Someone came home
Iooking foryou again.

1300
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:43,200
Who? Ismu?

1301
01:29:43,499 --> 01:29:45,701
l returned his money.

1302
01:29:45,799 --> 01:29:47,700
- How much did you give him?
- Forget it.

1303
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:49,667
Let that not keep
you away now.

1304
01:29:50,466 --> 01:29:51,433
l'll come.

1305
01:29:54,799 --> 01:29:56,934
Cary on!
Don't waste your time.

1306
01:30:05,132 --> 01:30:07,868
We could drop him if he's
going in the same direction.

1307
01:30:07,999 --> 01:30:10,434
No. He's going another way.
Let's go.

1308
01:30:27,165 --> 01:30:29,434
Siby, when did you
join Mlamade?

1309
01:30:31,165 --> 01:30:33,668
12th of last month.

1310
01:30:38,967 --> 01:30:41,002
Where were you
working before that?

1311
01:30:45,933 --> 01:30:47,567
Before that...

1312
01:31:01,233 --> 01:31:04,936
''The musical instrument of the wind''

1313
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:11,103
''Played the music''

1314

An array of trees waving hands''

1315
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:26,805

Stretching their dark eyes''

1316

1317

''The mind turns into a river''

1318
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:52,070
''Playing the music''

1319
01:31:54,633 --> 01:32:00,972
''The sky becomes the shore''

1320
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:16,906
''Come, come,
come here slowly''

1321
01:32:17,833 --> 01:32:23,038
''The wind hums in the ear''

1322
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:30,973
''Searching for a way
through this land''

1323
01:32:31,067 --> 01:32:37,173
''Seeking distances
that are out of sight''

1324
01:32:38,166 --> 01:32:44,706
''lnside the row oftrees
Lies a garden''

1325
01:32:44,833 --> 01:32:50,905
''Where a dream's precious mountain-spring,
searches for sight.''

1326
01:32:51,033 --> 01:32:57,706
''The musical instrument of the wind''

1327
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:03,505
''Played the music''

1328
01:33:17,767 --> 01:33:30,779
''The day flew like a butte_ly
to reach the sky all alone''

1329
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:43,612

But burning desires are along''

1330

Moonlight wrote the truth''

01:34:04,533 --> 01:34:10,138
''Played the music''

1334
01:34:36,533 --> 01:34:38,001
Tired?

1335
01:34:39,067 --> 01:34:40,468
Exhausted!

1336
01:34:40,967 --> 01:34:44,003
Let's climb this last mountain.
We're almost there.

1337
01:34:44,533 --> 01:34:46,601
l want to rest for 5 minutes.

1338
01:34:46,733 --> 01:34:50,970
lt's only a small distance away. There's
a good place to sit down over there.

1339
01:34:51,067 --> 01:34:53,569
Why, will we get chairs
over there?

1340
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:57,770
No. ARer this mountain,
it's downhill.

1341
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,068
- l'm scared to see a downhill walk.
-Why?

1342
01:35:00,933 --> 01:35:03,235
We'll have to climb up
on the way back.

1343
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:06,035
No, there are other
ways to get back.

1344
01:35:06,166 --> 01:35:10,004
That doesn't matter.
All downhills have uphills.

1345
01:35:10,833 --> 01:35:12,935
- Take it easy, Sir.
- l will!

1346
01:35:13,067 --> 01:35:14,668
There's a lot oftime.

1347
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:18,768
Hey, give me some water.

1348
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:31,002
- Howmuch longer?
- Only Stalin Chettan knows.

1349
01:35:41,033 --> 01:35:42,234
Comrade Stalin!

1350
01:35:44,233 --> 01:35:44,967
Come here.

1351
01:35:48,967 --> 01:35:50,935
How much longer to
Paandipath from here?

1352
01:35:51,067 --> 01:35:53,803
You've been making
us walk for a long time.

1353
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:56,168
Look there.
Do you see that fork in the hill?

1354
01:35:56,467 --> 01:35:58,836
Paandipath is right below it.

1355
01:36:30,666 --> 01:36:31,801
Stalin!

1356
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:33,534
-Yes?
- Come here.

1357
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:39,701
Howfar is Thalakaani from here?

1358
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,701
We need to set up
things here first.

1359
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:43,168
Yeah right.
l was just wondering.

1360
01:36:43,467 --> 01:36:44,734
We should gather
some firewood.

1361
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:47,569
Sure. By then
we'll set things up here.

1362
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:50,102
Hey come on!
Cary that axe too.

1363
01:36:54,733 --> 01:36:56,134
-Where are you going?
- l'll just be back.

1364
01:36:56,233 --> 01:36:59,769
- l'll come with you.
- Sheesh! Don't be shameful!

1365
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,602
They sound as ifthey are
chopping down the entire forest?

1366
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:13,601
Leave it to them.

1367
01:37:14,866 --> 01:37:16,235
Ho_s he?

1368
01:37:16,533 --> 01:37:18,935
Our comrade.
What do you think?

1369
01:37:19,467 --> 01:37:21,202
Nothing much.

1370
01:37:22,533 --> 01:37:24,201
He doesn't reveal vey much.

1371
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:26,201
Seems secretive about eveything.

1372
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,902
He's not the only one
who is secretive.

1373
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:34,870
That's okay. Eveyone
has their own interests.

1374
01:37:35,833 --> 01:37:37,434
What do you mean?

1375
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,636
You never told me
about the treasure.

1376
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:46,101
How did you come to kno_

1377
01:37:47,067 --> 01:37:48,501
l know it.

1378
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:58,936
l didn't want to scare
you by talking about it.

1379
01:37:59,067 --> 01:38:01,636
l thought l'd tell you
after we got here.

1380
01:38:03,833 --> 01:38:07,503
l wasn't sure what you'd think.

1381
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:09,734
That's why.

1382
01:38:10,733 --> 01:38:12,935
l never meant to hide anything.

1383
01:38:14,033 --> 01:38:15,134
Sory.

1384
01:38:15,233 --> 01:38:20,805
lt's not nice when you come to
know ofthings through other people.

1385
01:38:20,933 --> 01:38:22,467
That's what l meant.

1386
01:38:27,866 --> 01:38:29,568
Does Stalin kno_

1387
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:31,467
Yes.

1388
01:38:31,967 --> 01:38:33,601
Don't wory.
l'll deal with him.

1389
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:35,902
Don't forget.
We need his help for eveything.

1390
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:42,670
lt's okay, Sir.
l'm ready to do my best.

1391
01:38:42,767 --> 01:38:47,204
But if you'd told me earlier, we could've
organized one or two otherthings.

1392
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,635
- Like what?
- No use talking about it now.

1393
01:38:49,767 --> 01:38:53,770
- Tell me what it is.
- It's a waste of time.

1394
01:38:53,866 --> 01:38:54,934
Ok, forget it then.

1395
01:38:55,033 --> 01:38:59,003
lfwe all ty sincerely,
It will work out.

1396
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,201
Am l right?

1397
01:39:00,467 --> 01:39:01,868
Let's see.

1398
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:05,636
- l've heard such stories before.
- But this is different.

1399
01:39:05,767 --> 01:39:07,768
- There are eye-witnesses.
-Who?

1400
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:10,202
Aaramkallu Murugan.
That's how he lost his mind.

1401
01:39:10,467 --> 01:39:13,570
-Where's he no_
- He put his head under a train.

1402
01:39:13,666 --> 01:39:15,902
He was kept in a mortuay
for a week without a head.

1403
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:18,568
-Where did his head go?
- No one knom.

1404
01:39:18,666 --> 01:39:21,903
No one could recognize him.
So they buried him there itself.

1405
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,901
Then howdid they
know it's him?

1406
01:39:24,666 --> 01:39:27,236
People know.

1407
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,235
-Are you scared?
- Scared ofwhat?

1408
01:39:30,533 --> 01:39:32,434
Are you scared by such stories?

1409
01:39:32,567 --> 01:39:35,970
l'll cross that bridge
when l come to it.

1410
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:39,201
Kanna, are you scared?

1411
01:39:39,467 --> 01:39:41,802
The only person he is
scared of is Stalin.

1412
01:39:41,933 --> 01:39:44,702
No way! He's
not what you think.

1413
01:39:48,767 --> 01:39:51,703
We leave for Thalakaani
in the morning, right?

1414
01:39:51,833 --> 01:39:52,200
Yeah.

1415
01:39:53,067 --> 01:39:54,768
How long does
it take from here?

1416
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:58,003
Thalakaani is not
one particular place.

1417
01:39:58,133 --> 01:40:01,703
The whole area is
called Thalakaani.

1418
01:40:02,633 --> 01:40:03,667
l see!

1419
01:40:03,767 --> 01:40:05,802
Do we really need to
return by nightfall?

1420
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:07,801
Of course we have to.

1421
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:09,034
Let's forget about everything.

1422
01:40:09,166 --> 01:40:12,203
lfwe don't find the treasure we'll
Iook at it as a fun trip in the forest.

1423
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:15,102
Hard to say.
Luck matters.

1424
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,836
No one's found it till now.

1425
01:40:17,934 --> 01:40:22,104
That's why we're trying. Why would
we ty if someone else had found it.

1426
01:40:23,634 --> 01:40:25,736
How many crores
do you think it's worth?

1427
01:40:25,867 --> 01:40:29,605
Anyway you mark my words. We won't
Ieave this forest empty-handed.

1428
01:40:29,734 --> 01:40:33,137
That treasure is
written in my stars.

1429
01:40:37,468 --> 01:40:38,902
Shall we go?

1430
01:40:39,568 --> 01:40:42,237
lt's an inauspicious time now.
Wait till 7.30.

1431
01:40:42,501 --> 01:40:45,637
At least eat. There's no
good or bad time for that.

1432
01:40:45,768 --> 01:40:47,636
l'm coming!

1433
01:40:53,034 --> 01:40:54,468
This is for lunch.

1434
01:40:55,101 --> 01:40:56,202
Where are the eggs?

1435
01:40:56,468 --> 01:40:58,136
- In the bag.
- Didn't you boil them?

1436
01:40:58,268 --> 01:41:01,170
-You didn't tell me.
- Have you to be told eveything?

1437
01:41:04,568 --> 01:41:08,238
-You're staying back here, right?
- Let him also come.

1438
01:41:08,534 --> 01:41:13,672
He has certain beliefs.
We can't force him to come.

1439
01:41:13,768 --> 01:41:15,136
What's his problem?

1440
01:41:15,268 --> 01:41:17,637
His folks don't go to Thalakaani.

1441
01:41:17,768 --> 01:41:20,737
They say people are transformed
when they return from there.

1442
01:41:20,867 --> 01:41:21,835
ls this true?

1443
01:41:21,934 --> 01:41:24,236
Yeah. Let him stay back.

1444
01:41:24,501 --> 01:41:27,103
lt's good to have
someone here. Right?

1445
01:41:27,201 --> 01:41:29,202
-Are you scared to be alone?
- No.

1446
01:41:29,468 --> 01:41:32,137
There's nothing to be
scared of. We'll be back by evening.

1447
01:41:32,234 --> 01:41:34,469
Do you knowanyone
who has transformed?

1448
01:41:34,568 --> 01:41:35,435
Leave him alone.

1449
01:41:35,534 --> 01:41:38,837
Eveyone has their own beliefs
like yours in inauspicious time.

1450
01:41:48,167 --> 01:41:49,569
Take a look.

1451
01:41:52,534 --> 01:41:54,102
Did you see something?

1452
01:42:00,068 --> 01:42:00,968
Not there.

1453
01:42:02,068 --> 01:42:02,968
Look here.

1454
01:42:07,034 --> 01:42:07,868
What's that?

1455
01:42:08,734 --> 01:42:10,836
We can see something there.

1456
01:42:11,801 --> 01:42:13,202
That's an Ubb.

1457
01:42:14,068 --> 01:42:16,870
-An Ubb?
-Yeah. Like a cave.

1458
01:42:17,001 --> 01:42:18,602
There are so many.

1459
01:42:19,134 --> 01:42:20,602
Shall we go and see?

1460
01:42:53,568 --> 01:42:55,036
Let me take a look.

1461
01:43:28,134 --> 01:43:29,702
What the hell is he saying?

1462
01:43:32,201 --> 01:43:34,770
lt's a bear's den!

1463
01:43:35,734 --> 01:43:37,836
- Did you see the bear?
- It's inside.

1464
01:43:37,968 --> 01:43:38,735
Will it come outside?

1465
01:43:38,867 --> 01:43:42,071
We can't be sure, Sir.
It's a senseless animal.

1466
01:43:42,201 --> 01:43:44,436
Let's not stand here.
Let's go.

1467
01:43:46,068 --> 01:43:48,737
Sameera! Listen to me.
It's dangerous.

1468
01:43:48,834 --> 01:43:50,135
Shh...
Don't make such a noise.

1469
01:43:53,001 --> 01:43:54,669
lt probably won't
come out till nightfall.

1470
01:43:54,768 --> 01:43:57,237
Then why are we standing here?
Come let's go.

1471
01:43:58,534 --> 01:43:59,034
Come!

1472
01:43:59,167 --> 01:44:01,603
Why are you panicking?
We don't get to see bears everyday.

1473
01:44:01,734 --> 01:44:05,437
Why would you want to see a bear eveyday?
Anyway, have we come here to see a bear?

1474
01:44:05,568 --> 01:44:06,702
- Have we?
- No.

1475
01:44:06,834 --> 01:44:09,570
Let's go find the treasure.
The bear can wait.

1476
01:44:11,201 --> 01:44:12,435
Let's leave.

1477
01:44:15,034 --> 01:44:16,535
Sameera, hury up!

1478
01:45:04,167 --> 01:45:04,868
Stalin.

1479
01:45:10,068 --> 01:45:10,768
Stalin!

1480
01:45:19,834 --> 01:45:20,534
Stalin!

1481
01:45:21,901 --> 01:45:24,203
-What's that noise?
-What noise?

1482
01:45:24,901 --> 01:45:25,868
lt's coming from nearby.

1483
01:45:29,001 --> 01:45:30,635
ls it a bear?

1484
01:45:31,667 --> 01:45:33,669
Bears won't come as
Iong as the fire's burning.

1485
01:45:34,568 --> 01:45:36,102
Let's add some more firewood?

1486
01:45:36,901 --> 01:45:39,470
This will do. It will
Iast till morning.

1487
01:45:39,568 --> 01:45:42,070
Siby, go to sleep
for God's sake!

1488
01:45:42,801 --> 01:45:45,170
l heard a strange noise.
Did you hear it?

1489
01:45:48,734 --> 01:45:50,235
Or, was itjust a feeling?

1490
01:45:50,501 --> 01:45:54,671
Afeeling for no reason?
You better watch out.

1491
01:46:17,934 --> 01:46:19,001
Where are they?

1492
01:46:25,268 --> 01:46:27,236
-Are you making co_ee?
-Yeah.

1493
01:46:30,034 --> 01:46:32,002
What do you do here
alone during the day?

1494
01:46:32,134 --> 01:46:33,468
Nothing.

1495
01:46:35,667 --> 01:46:37,970
Heard that you got into a
bear's den yesterday?

1496
01:46:38,101 --> 01:46:40,069
Yeah.
Luckily we escaped.

1497
01:46:42,701 --> 01:46:45,036
l heard a noise last night.

1498
01:46:45,167 --> 01:46:47,036
Was it a bear?

1499
01:46:47,134 --> 01:46:49,035
- That's not a bear.
- Did you hear it also?

1500
01:46:49,134 --> 01:46:49,834
Yeah.

1501
01:46:50,634 --> 01:46:51,201
What was it?

1502
01:46:51,501 --> 01:46:52,735
l don't know.

1503
01:46:52,867 --> 01:46:54,703
lt's sometimes heard at night.

1504
01:46:54,834 --> 01:46:56,001
Don't you knowwhat it is?

1505
01:47:01,468 --> 01:47:05,839
- Could it be an owl?
- No. No one knom what it is.

1506
01:47:06,234 --> 01:47:07,501
What could it be?

1507
01:47:07,901 --> 01:47:10,770
lt sounded like breath right?

1508
01:47:10,901 --> 01:47:12,702
Yeah! What's that?

1509
01:47:12,801 --> 01:47:13,935
Kaattumooli.

1510
01:47:21,701 --> 01:47:22,468
Sameera!

1511
01:47:25,034 --> 01:47:26,769
l'm sure we came
this way yesterday.

1512
01:47:29,801 --> 01:47:31,135
-ls it?
-Yes!

1513
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:33,202
Ask him, Sameera.

1514
01:47:34,034 --> 01:47:35,535
Why don't you ask?

1515
01:47:36,034 --> 01:47:37,034
l'll ask.

1516
01:47:37,134 --> 01:47:37,801
Stalin!

1517
01:47:41,768 --> 01:47:44,036
Didn't we come this
way yesterday?

1518
01:47:44,701 --> 01:47:47,970
There are some places
IeR to see around here.

1519
01:47:48,101 --> 01:47:49,969
Why didn't you show
them to us yesterday?

1520
01:47:50,101 --> 01:47:52,837
You decided to
go to the Bear's den.

1521
01:48:04,167 --> 01:48:06,703
We should search this
place thoroughly.

1522
01:48:06,801 --> 01:48:07,801
This is a good sign.

1523
01:48:07,901 --> 01:48:09,702
Exactly what l said.

1524
01:48:09,801 --> 01:48:12,203
l don't think it has anything
to do with the treasure.

1525
01:48:13,101 --> 01:48:13,768
Why?

1526
01:48:14,934 --> 01:48:18,237
According to the stoy, the gold was
hidden during the time of Tipu Sultan.

1527
01:48:18,534 --> 01:48:20,102
That is not so long back.

1528
01:48:20,201 --> 01:48:22,536
About 200 years ago maybe.

1529
01:48:23,534 --> 01:48:26,503
These are at least
5000 years old.

1530
01:48:26,968 --> 01:48:27,835
So?

1531
01:48:28,568 --> 01:48:31,070
So there's no connection.

1532
01:48:31,834 --> 01:48:33,769
l don't get your logic.

1533
01:48:34,501 --> 01:48:35,635
Think about it.

1534
01:48:35,734 --> 01:48:37,569
There are other places too.

1535
01:48:39,268 --> 01:48:40,535
- Other places?
-Yeah.

1536
01:48:40,634 --> 01:48:44,137
Many more places around herel
You're sure to like them.

1537
01:48:44,968 --> 01:48:46,936
So you've come here before?

1538
01:48:48,167 --> 01:48:50,837
l haven't come here.
l've come nearby.

1539
01:48:50,934 --> 01:48:52,568
What do you mean
you didn't come here?

1540
01:48:55,634 --> 01:48:59,437
Why are you taking us to places
when you knowthere's nothing?

1541
01:48:59,568 --> 01:49:01,636
But l've never come here
Iooking for a treasure.

1542
01:49:01,768 --> 01:49:02,101
Then?

1543
01:49:02,201 --> 01:49:04,069
lt's a forest.
There are lots of reasons.

1544
01:49:04,167 --> 01:49:05,869
What are we here for no_

1545
01:49:06,001 --> 01:49:10,438
We all know.
Why do you keep asking?

1546
01:49:10,768 --> 01:49:15,172
You once said you don't like going
to places where eveyone goes.

1547
01:49:15,268 --> 01:49:17,570
But that's exactly what
we're doing now.

1548
01:49:20,667 --> 01:49:23,637
- Didn't he like the place?
- Doesn't matter.

1549
01:49:23,734 --> 01:49:24,734
What's the problem?

1550
01:49:25,768 --> 01:49:26,735
Come, l'll tell you.

1551
01:49:30,801 --> 01:49:34,171
What's the point in going
to the same place eveyday?

1552
01:49:34,468 --> 01:49:37,204
He says that's the
only way to Thalakaani.

1553
01:49:37,501 --> 01:49:39,836
Only one way?
l doubt it.

1554
01:49:39,934 --> 01:49:42,236
We have to believe
him if he says so.

1555
01:49:42,501 --> 01:49:45,537
Why does he want us
back here evey night?

1556
01:49:45,667 --> 01:49:47,436
He told us that
in the beginning.

1557
01:49:47,534 --> 01:49:48,501
Howstupid!

1558
01:49:48,601 --> 01:49:51,570
ls this the only place
in the forest with water?

1559
01:49:52,601 --> 01:49:54,869
Balan Pillai already
warned me about him.

1560
01:49:55,001 --> 01:49:58,003
Balan Pillai warned us of
many other things as well.

1561
01:50:00,701 --> 01:50:02,570
Why don't you talk to him?

1562
01:50:02,668 --> 01:50:04,937
Let's shift to another place.

1563
01:50:05,069 --> 01:50:07,838
- But there's a problem.
-What?

1564
01:50:07,935 --> 01:50:10,103
Kannan refuses to come there.

1565
01:50:10,235 --> 01:50:12,737
My dear Sameera,
they're cooking up stories!

1566
01:50:28,802 --> 01:50:31,104
That's it!
It's time to return.

1567
01:50:31,202 --> 01:50:34,171
There's still time left. We only
need to get back before nightfall.

1568
01:50:34,269 --> 01:50:36,904
That's not the point.
We need to find a way out.

1569
01:50:37,035 --> 01:50:38,736
- It won't work otherwise.
-You tell me.

1570
01:50:38,868 --> 01:50:40,904
You should talk to Kannan.

1571
01:50:41,035 --> 01:50:43,237
We can't do eveything
according to his convenience.

1572
01:50:44,002 --> 01:50:47,071
Can we go without Kannan?
Let him stay here.

1573
01:50:47,202 --> 01:50:48,202
lt's only a matter
of 2-3 days.

1574
01:50:48,502 --> 01:50:51,471
We can't leave him alone
at night. That's different.

1575
01:50:52,135 --> 01:50:54,203
You shouldn't have brought
him in the first place.

1576
01:50:54,502 --> 01:50:58,439
l had told you earlier.
Thalakaani is not for the night.

1577
01:50:58,569 --> 01:50:59,436
Whatever!

1578
01:51:04,969 --> 01:51:06,470
Let's do one thing.

1579
01:51:08,135 --> 01:51:09,736
Let's split into two.

1580
01:51:10,569 --> 01:51:11,069
And?

1581
01:51:11,168 --> 01:51:14,238
Two of us will go. And one of
us will stay with Kannan.

1582
01:51:14,502 --> 01:51:15,436
Ho_

1583
01:51:15,535 --> 01:51:18,204
Either l stay with Kannan
or you stay.

1584
01:51:18,469 --> 01:51:20,604
Let Stalin stay here.
We'll go.

1585
01:51:20,702 --> 01:51:22,804
That's not possible.
We need Stalin.

1586
01:51:22,935 --> 01:51:24,936
l don't mind staying here.

1587
01:51:27,069 --> 01:51:28,136
Do you want me to go?

1588
01:51:29,235 --> 01:51:31,737
Stay here ifyou want to rest.

1589
01:51:31,835 --> 01:51:34,003
Kannan will take care of you.
l'll go and come.

1590
01:51:34,835 --> 01:51:37,671
Please ask him once more.
What if he agrees to come.

1591
01:51:37,769 --> 01:51:39,937
Don't ask him again.
He won't come.

1592
01:51:40,835 --> 01:51:41,669
Then l'll go.

1593
01:51:42,469 --> 01:51:44,671
You stay here.
It's betterthat l go.

1594
01:51:44,802 --> 01:51:46,036
l don't want you to go alone.

1595
01:51:46,135 --> 01:51:47,769
l won't be alone.
There's Stalin.

1596
01:51:47,902 --> 01:51:49,169
No, Sameera!

1597
01:51:51,202 --> 01:51:51,969
l'll go.

1598
01:51:52,835 --> 01:51:54,436
Are you ready?

1599
01:51:55,235 --> 01:51:56,569
We'll go.

1600
01:51:57,502 --> 01:51:59,070
-Are you sure?
- Of course!

1601
01:51:59,168 --> 01:52:01,738
- It's betterthat l go.
- l'm not sure about that.

1602
01:52:05,069 --> 01:52:07,004
l wanted you to come.

1603
01:52:07,135 --> 01:52:08,803
But it's alright.
l'll go.

1604
01:52:09,769 --> 01:52:11,203
He's so excited.

1605
01:52:30,069 --> 01:52:31,637
ls there any fish?

1606
01:52:33,069 --> 01:52:35,171
- Did they ask you anything?
-Yeah.

1607
01:52:35,269 --> 01:52:36,670
What did they ask?

1608
01:52:36,802 --> 01:52:39,070
She asked me if
l could go to Thalakaani.

1609
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:41,137
- Didn't you say you won't go?
-Yeah.

1610
01:52:41,235 --> 01:52:42,536
Then what did she say?

1611
01:52:42,635 --> 01:52:45,704
She said it's ok if l'm scared.
Someone will stay with me.

1612
01:52:47,668 --> 01:52:49,871
l wouldn't have come
ifyou'd told me earlier.

1613
01:52:50,002 --> 01:52:51,903
That's why l didn't tell you.

1614
01:52:52,035 --> 01:52:53,102
When are we going back?

1615
01:52:53,235 --> 01:52:56,705
We'll go after showing
him a few more places.

1616
01:52:56,802 --> 01:52:58,069
We'll be out of food by then.

1617
01:52:58,202 --> 01:53:01,972
- There's a lot of grain left.
- Don't you wory. We'll finish it.

1618
01:53:02,069 --> 01:53:05,605
Tell them you're also scared.
Why do you want to go there for nothing?

1619
01:53:06,202 --> 01:53:08,904
- It's not for nothing.
- This is all for nothing.

1620
01:53:09,002 --> 01:53:11,771
lt's your people that talk
about the treasure.

1621
01:53:11,902 --> 01:53:15,171
That may be true.
But no one can get it.

1622
01:53:15,735 --> 01:53:18,437
Our ancestors guard
it even today.

1623
01:53:19,202 --> 01:53:21,170
They'll rob us off
our Souls ifwe go there.

1624
01:53:21,635 --> 01:53:24,704
We'll return hollowmen.

1625
01:53:25,069 --> 01:53:27,805
- Who told you this?
- Kaali Uncle.

1626
01:53:33,035 --> 01:53:34,636
Must be some truth in it!

1627
01:53:36,635 --> 01:53:37,635
lt's ok.

1628
01:53:38,002 --> 01:53:40,871
He's not as bad as you think.

1629
01:53:40,969 --> 01:53:42,437
That's not the problem.

1630
01:53:43,235 --> 01:53:45,170
l wish you were with me.

1631
01:53:46,569 --> 01:53:49,438
When you find the treasure,
don't forget my share, okay?

1632
01:53:50,569 --> 01:53:52,971
Don't tease me.
l might even find it.

1633
01:53:55,935 --> 01:53:58,604
Have you read 'TheAlchemist'?

1634
01:53:58,735 --> 01:53:59,769
No. Why?

1635
01:54:01,035 --> 01:54:03,771
lt's about a man who
goes in search of a treasure.

1636
01:54:04,802 --> 01:54:06,003
And, does he find it?

1637
01:54:06,135 --> 01:54:08,003
l won't reveal the end.

1638
01:54:08,702 --> 01:54:12,072
He must not have found it.
That's why you thought of it now.

1639
01:54:12,668 --> 01:54:14,837
- That's not the reason.
- Then?

1640
01:54:15,769 --> 01:54:17,937
There's a mist in the stoy.

1641
01:54:18,735 --> 01:54:19,435
What's that?

1642
01:54:19,569 --> 01:54:26,008
He discovers something when he reaches
his destination aRer a long journey.

1643
01:54:26,935 --> 01:54:27,802
What?

1644
01:54:28,835 --> 01:54:32,205
That the treasure lay
where his journey began.

1645
01:54:46,269 --> 01:54:48,004
Hey, take care of her.

1646
01:54:48,602 --> 01:54:52,172
We're going to have a terrific
time aRer you go. Right?

1647
01:54:52,835 --> 01:54:53,869
Alright then.

1648
01:54:54,469 --> 01:54:56,637
Bring us something special
when you come back.

1649
01:54:56,735 --> 01:54:57,802
One more thing...

1650
01:54:57,902 --> 01:55:02,539
Mark your path so that
you don't forget the way.

1651
01:55:03,902 --> 01:55:05,570
Take some photos too.

1652
01:55:06,502 --> 01:55:07,903
Relax.

1653
01:55:08,635 --> 01:55:13,439
Don't risk your life for anything.
No treasure is worth your life.

1654
01:55:26,102 --> 01:55:28,971
-When will they come back?
- Leave it to them.

1655
01:55:29,769 --> 01:55:31,070
They might come tomorrow.

1656
01:55:32,069 --> 01:55:33,136
How do you know?

1657
01:55:33,269 --> 01:55:34,870
- Did Stalin tell you anything?
- No.

1658
01:55:36,902 --> 01:55:41,873
What will we do ifthey come
back with hollow bodies?

1659
01:56:19,735 --> 01:56:20,769
lt's a bison!

1660
01:56:21,935 --> 01:56:24,037
Costs 600 Rs. A kilo.

1661
01:56:25,102 --> 01:56:27,137
-We're looking for...
- Shhh!

1662
01:56:27,235 --> 01:56:30,171
What we're looking for costs
25 Lakh Rs per kilo.

1663
01:56:30,269 --> 01:56:32,170
Let's leave this and
Iook for that treasure.

1664
01:56:42,002 --> 01:56:44,671
Who did you say sawthe treasure?

1665
01:56:44,769 --> 01:56:47,671
-Aaramkallu Murugan.
-Where did he see it?

1666
01:56:47,769 --> 01:56:49,103
l don't know.

1667
01:56:49,902 --> 01:56:51,770
Could be in a cave.

1668
01:56:51,868 --> 01:56:53,770
They're usually good
to hide things.

1669
01:56:54,235 --> 01:56:56,870
l'm sure it will be in
a totally unexpected place!

1670
01:56:57,602 --> 01:56:59,170
Do you have any expectations?

1671
01:56:59,902 --> 01:57:01,937
What kind of a
question is that?

1672
01:57:02,035 --> 01:57:04,704
Sometimes l feel you're
not serious about it.

1673
01:57:05,502 --> 01:57:08,171
Howcan we not be serious?
We're risking our lives.

1674
01:57:08,269 --> 01:57:09,069
Really?

1675
01:57:09,902 --> 01:57:13,538
l'm notjoking.
You'll realize yourself soon.

1676
01:57:44,502 --> 01:57:45,236
Aunty!

1677
01:57:45,868 --> 01:57:46,970
Don't wory.

1678
01:57:47,069 --> 01:57:48,970
l've known her
since l was a kid.

1679
01:57:51,235 --> 01:57:53,870
Why are you blocking the way?
We need to cross.

1680
01:57:57,569 --> 01:57:58,770
Come on, move out.

1681
01:58:03,002 --> 01:58:04,103
Run!

1682
01:58:15,969 --> 01:58:17,837
Stalin, why the hell
did you do that?

1683
01:58:18,935 --> 01:58:21,837
She's harmless, Sir.
Just playing around.

1684
01:58:22,868 --> 01:58:24,036
Did you get scared?

1685
01:58:26,269 --> 01:58:27,203
Let's go.

1686
01:58:28,802 --> 01:58:29,736
Come on, Sir.

1687
01:58:54,569 --> 01:58:56,070
Are you tired?

1688
01:58:59,102 --> 01:59:00,870
Do you have more water?

1689
01:59:01,569 --> 01:59:02,770
l have some.

1690
01:59:49,636 --> 01:59:50,570
Stalin!!

1691
01:59:52,203 --> 01:59:54,204
Look at this!
Do you understand?

1692
01:59:54,470 --> 01:59:56,205
- This is..--
- Look carefully.

1693
01:59:56,470 --> 01:59:58,205
-A knife?
- No, a sword!

1694
01:59:58,470 --> 02:00:00,705
lt's a part of an ancient
sword. Look at it!

1695
02:00:00,836 --> 02:00:04,573
We needn't go anywhere else!
We have arrived at our destination!

1696
02:00:05,136 --> 02:00:08,072
We're lucky! Or else
we wouldn't find it here.

1697
02:00:08,203 --> 02:00:10,071
This is awesome!!

1698
02:00:10,903 --> 02:00:11,937
We needn't look back again.

1699
02:00:12,070 --> 02:00:14,939
Let's praiseAaramkallu Murugan
and get moving!

1700
02:00:18,770 --> 02:00:20,471
Sir... Iet's go.

1701
02:00:21,070 --> 02:00:23,739
Go where?
This is the place!

1702
02:00:29,036 --> 02:00:30,737
You still don't believe me?

1703
02:00:31,903 --> 02:00:34,205
Listen.
We'll stay here.

1704
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:35,571
We can't stay here.

1705
02:00:35,703 --> 02:00:38,038
- There's a reason. Ty and understand!
- l have a reason too.

1706
02:00:38,136 --> 02:00:40,471
l don't care.
We'll stay here today.

1707
02:00:45,903 --> 02:00:47,738
Stalin!
Where are you going?

1708
02:00:47,836 --> 02:00:50,471
We need water and firewood.

1709
02:01:06,669 --> 02:01:08,705
lt's an elephant!
Run!

1710
02:01:39,036 --> 02:01:40,103
Stalin!

1711
02:01:46,536 --> 02:01:47,470
Comrade...

1712
02:01:51,169 --> 02:01:52,905
When are we going back?

1713
02:01:53,270 --> 02:01:56,172
We're not in any hury.
Let them return first.

1714
02:01:58,470 --> 02:02:01,506
lt's because ofyou. l would've
gone with them otherwise.

1715
02:02:02,136 --> 02:02:04,638
- Did you want to go?
- Of course!

1716
02:02:05,036 --> 02:02:06,704
l'm not scared like you.

1717
02:02:07,669 --> 02:02:10,472
l thought you didn't want to go.

1718
02:02:59,136 --> 02:03:02,639
Should we look forthem?
It's been so long.

1719
02:03:15,203 --> 02:03:16,671
Siby!

1720
02:03:18,136 --> 02:03:20,938
Oh Siby! You scared
the hell out of us!

1721
02:03:22,736 --> 02:03:24,003
Come on. Drink!

1722
02:03:34,169 --> 02:03:35,070
Stalin...

1723
02:03:46,003 --> 02:03:46,903
Comrade!

1724
02:03:55,703 --> 02:03:58,072
Hope you remember
the way to Thalakaani.

1725
02:04:00,270 --> 02:04:01,638
Somewhat.

1726
02:04:01,770 --> 02:04:02,737
Stalin knows.

1727
02:04:03,270 --> 02:04:05,939
No, l'm asking ifyou
knowthe way.

1728
02:04:09,836 --> 02:04:10,870
What's the matter?

1729
02:04:13,503 --> 02:04:15,671
Stalin won't come again.

1730
02:04:16,669 --> 02:04:18,671
He wants to leave
in the morning.

1731
02:04:19,970 --> 02:04:21,571
How's that possible?

1732
02:04:21,669 --> 02:04:23,838
How can we leave when
eveything has just fallen into place?

1733
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:26,138
Leave it! There's no
point discussing it.

1734
02:04:31,236 --> 02:04:32,937
Can l tell you something?

1735
02:04:33,503 --> 02:04:38,074
Nowwe have a rough
idea about eveything.

1736
02:04:38,836 --> 02:04:43,473
Next time we'll come with
a proper plan. No confusion.

1737
02:04:46,103 --> 02:04:47,637
What's the confusion no_

1738
02:04:48,236 --> 02:04:50,938
They say they want to leave.

1739
02:04:51,503 --> 02:04:52,470
Let them leave.

1740
02:04:53,103 --> 02:04:55,505
We should also go with them.

1741
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:58,104
- Do you want to go?
-What else can we do?

1742
02:04:58,236 --> 02:05:00,671
We'll be out offood
after tomorrow.

1743
02:05:00,770 --> 02:05:03,572
Do you knowthe way back?

1744
02:05:03,669 --> 02:05:06,139
l don't know. How
will we go back?

1745
02:05:06,270 --> 02:05:07,871
ls that what you think?

1746
02:05:09,003 --> 02:05:09,670
Yeah.

1747
02:05:14,936 --> 02:05:17,071
Then you guys leave.
l'll come later.

1748
02:05:18,669 --> 02:05:23,508
Don't you understand? His plan is to
get rid of us and take the gold.

1749
02:05:23,636 --> 02:05:24,036
Siby...

1750
02:05:24,136 --> 02:05:26,505
Stalin does not have the guts.

1751
02:05:26,603 --> 02:05:28,771
He said he'll never
go there again.

1752
02:05:31,070 --> 02:05:33,672
l'm not coming.
You guys can leave.

1753
02:05:33,803 --> 02:05:35,604
Why don't you understand?

1754
02:05:36,136 --> 02:05:37,937
l understand your concerns.

1755
02:05:38,070 --> 02:05:38,737
No you don't.

1756
02:05:38,836 --> 02:05:41,905
You don't understand anything.
That's why you talk like this.

1757
02:05:45,270 --> 02:05:48,172
Can l sleep please?
l didn't sleep a wink last night.

1758
02:05:51,570 --> 02:05:52,170
Neither did l.

1759
02:06:01,869 --> 02:06:05,707
He's lost his mind after finding that.
Tell him to throw it away.

1760
02:06:07,703 --> 02:06:11,640
Siby, it's extremely dangerous.
Why can't you understand?

1761
02:06:13,169 --> 02:06:16,473
We're not giving up.
We'll come back soon.

1762
02:06:16,869 --> 02:06:18,805
You won't be able to
survive here alone.

1763
02:06:18,936 --> 02:06:20,804
Come, let's go and come back.

1764
02:06:20,936 --> 02:06:23,138
l can't come without
finishing this, Sameera.

1765
02:06:23,270 --> 02:06:26,106
l've been 'surviving'
for too long now.

1766
02:06:26,736 --> 02:06:27,670
But why?

1767
02:06:28,869 --> 02:06:32,206
You might've forgotten.
But l remember it clearly.

1768
02:06:32,503 --> 02:06:35,906
You once asked me what l did
before joining Mlamade.

1769
02:06:36,003 --> 02:06:36,903
Remember?

1770
02:06:37,703 --> 02:06:39,638
Shouldn't l be able to
reply at least now.

1771
02:06:40,003 --> 02:06:43,005
l don't want to say
that l was just 'surviving'.

1772
02:06:47,169 --> 02:06:48,571
l want to go.

1773
02:06:51,803 --> 02:06:53,638
You guys leave!
l'll come back.

1774
02:07:00,869 --> 02:07:04,573
Can we wait fortoday
and leave tomorrow?

1775
02:07:04,669 --> 02:07:07,005
What if he changes his mind?

1776
02:07:07,136 --> 02:07:08,937
l don't think he'll ever
change his mind.

1777
02:07:10,136 --> 02:07:11,237
You guys leave.

1778
02:07:11,536 --> 02:07:13,237
l'll contact you
after getting back.

1779
02:07:16,070 --> 02:07:16,837
And...

1780
02:07:18,636 --> 02:07:19,470
This...

1781
02:07:20,103 --> 02:07:23,973
lt's better to put it it back,
rather than throw it away.

1782
02:07:26,736 --> 02:07:28,704
Hey Kanna,
give me some water.

1783
02:07:40,003 --> 02:07:41,504
No. Keep it.

1784
02:07:43,236 --> 02:07:45,938
You lucky guy! You can now
go home without being scared.

1785
02:07:46,070 --> 02:07:49,006
-Where's your house?
-AtAaramkallu Murugan's.

1786
02:07:49,136 --> 02:07:51,438
So you knowAaramkallu Murugan?

1787
02:07:51,570 --> 02:07:54,072
Aaramkallu Murugan... was my father.

1788
02:16:03,971 --> 02:16:04,638
Sir!

1789
02:16:09,471 --> 02:16:11,206
Where were you?

1790
02:16:11,504 --> 02:16:13,205
Did you see my elephant?

1791
02:16:13,504 --> 02:16:15,806
He goes missing in a flash.

1792
02:16:18,771 --> 02:16:19,905
What happened, Sir?

1793
02:16:20,004 --> 02:16:21,739
Work hard to get what you like.

1794
02:16:21,837 --> 02:16:24,873
lfyou don't like to work hard
you'll lose what you like.

1795
02:16:24,971 --> 02:16:26,072
Shall l go?

1796
02:16:26,837 --> 02:16:27,971
Raghav!

1797
02:18:21,270 --> 02:18:23,439
You look so tired.

1798
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:27,872
Did you get the treasure?

1799
02:18:28,504 --> 02:18:30,706
Can you give
me some water?

1800
02:18:30,837 --> 02:18:33,606
Water only?
Don't you want the treasure?

1801
02:18:34,571 --> 02:18:36,205
Where can l get water?

1802
02:18:36,471 --> 02:18:39,941
The treasure lies in
the cave we're afraid to enter.

1803
02:18:40,071 --> 02:18:41,806
Haven't you heard that?

1804
02:18:44,737 --> 02:18:46,038
Do you want to ty?

1805
02:18:47,571 --> 02:18:48,805
Are you afraid?

1806
02:18:49,904 --> 02:18:50,771
No.

''The lightning sparkles,
spills and scatters in the eyes''

1808
02:19:08,504 --> 02:19:12,241
''The lightning sparkles,

1809
02:19:12,537 --> 02:19:17,609
''To awaken living beings''

1810
02:19:22,672 --> 02:19:30,246
''New paths appear before us''

''New paths appear before us
to swim across and reach beyond''

1812
02:19:44,938 --> 02:19:54,247

Do paths fade so much?''

1817
02:23:47,972 --> 02:23:50,774
-Which is the way to Cheenkannipara?
- Cheenkannipara?

1818
02:23:50,871 --> 02:23:52,607
lt's in Kerala.

1819
02:23:57,072 --> 02:23:59,140
- Can you drop me there?
- It's far away.

1820
02:23:59,271 --> 02:24:02,241
There's a bus at 10.15.
Take that.

1821
02:24:03,105 --> 02:24:04,506
How much should l pay you?

1822
02:24:04,638 --> 02:24:07,941
We've to take a permit at
the check-post. It'll be 3000 Rs.

1823
02:24:10,005 --> 02:24:11,206
Will you take this?
