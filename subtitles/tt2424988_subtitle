1
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,426
'How many were they?'

2
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,695
"Do whatever you want."

3
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,535
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

4
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,370
"Be a little scared, son."

5
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,171
"Or Gabbar will show up."

6
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,007
"Do whatever you want."

7
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,638
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

8
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,477
"Be a little scared, son."

9
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,539
"Or Gabbar will show up."

10
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,448
"Gabbar."

11
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,146
"Gabbar."

12
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,754
"Gabbar."

13
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,524
"Gabbar will be happy."

14
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,355
"This is not a comic or a game."

15
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,292
"He's not the Spider or Superman."

16
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,125
"He roams the streets
at night for your safety."

17
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,755
"Gabbar is the better man."

18
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,565
"Gabbar is a brave-heart."

19
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,532
"When the lion walks in the jungle.."

20
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,364
"..the scavengers
make themselves scarce."

21
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,165
"This lion hunts only those.."

22
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,069
"..who make money the wrong way."

23
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,073
Even 50 miles away..

24
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,699
...when someone takes a bribe..

25
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:52,640
---- People say..

26
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:53,573
"Don't take it, or..

27
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,078
...Gabbar will show up."

28
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,738
"Evil only begets evil."

29
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,510
"There's still time
so straighten up now."

30
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,413
"And if you don't.."

31
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:02,248
"..you'll get a one
way ticket to hell."

32
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,752
"Don't make this mistake."

33
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,547
"Save your head."

34
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,592
"if you want to sleep
at nights, then.."

35
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,183
"..be afraid of Gabbar."

36
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,360
"Do whatever you want."

37
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,226
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

38
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,993
"Be a little scared, son."

39
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,659
"Or Gabbar will show up."

40
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,498
"Do whatever you want."

41
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,367
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

42
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,030
"Be a little scared, son."

43
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,573
"Or Gabbar will show up."

44
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,675
"Gabbar."

45
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,534
"Gabbar."

46
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,179
"Gabbar."

47
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,776
"Why should bravo?"

48
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,540
"Gabbar."

49
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,651
"Gabbar."

50
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,577
"Gabbar."

51
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,690
"Do whatever you want."

52
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,726
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

53
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,351
"Be a little scared, son."

54
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,157
"Or Gabbar will show up."

55
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,198
Deeds of a hero..name of a villain.

56
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,184
How many were they?

57
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,317
Two, chief.

58
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,692
Two men..

59
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,332
Pigheads!

60
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,429
For the people of Latur,
we bring you..

61
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,335
The queen of 'Once more'.. Devyani.

62
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:32,240
"The way I mesmerized him!"

63
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:38,746
"The way I mesmerized him!"
"That wrestler was stunned."

64
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,713
"The bomb of youth has exploded!"

65
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:45,688
"The bomb of youth
has blasted the world is shocked."

66
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:49,454
"The bomb of youth has exploded!"

67
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,722
Get up! Get up!

68
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,363
Quiet. - Who are you?

69
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,999
Take whatever you want.

70
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,031
We want your husband.
- Take him. Take him.

71
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,299
Come on. - Take him.

72
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,750
Hello.. What?

73
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,979
Nanded's Collector
has been kidnapped, sir.

74
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,088
What?

75
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,319
Sir, Nashik's Collector
has been kidnapped.

76
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:31,688
Nashik?

77
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,560
No, you mean Nanded.

78
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,599
Don't confuse us.

79
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,431
Sir, Vijay's calling from Nashik.

80
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,231
Nashik's Collector
has been kidnapped.

81
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,460
Sir, news from Latur.

82
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,096
There's been a kidnapping.

83
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,339
-Sh, Sangâ€œ too.-

84
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,036
Listen..this is front page news.

85
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:46,633
Stop the press!

86
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,769
Stop the press right now!

87
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,250
Maharashtra in great danger.

88
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,750
10 collectors
go missing overnight.

89
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,756
The police have setup check posts across the
state after the kidnapping of the Collectors.

90
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,992
Everyone is asking the same question.

91
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,959
Who is behind this?

92
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:08,327
'Only one man can save
you from Gabbar's fury.'

93
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,730
'Only one man.'

94
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,001
'Gabbar himself.'

95
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:50,106
10 Collectors
go missing suddenly"

96
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,369
...and the Home Ministry
hasn't issued any statement yet.

97
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,739
This incident
happened three days ago, sir.

98
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,138
Can you tell me
what you are all doing?

99
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,771
Look, we're investigating the matter.

100
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,649
Soon we'll know who
is behind all this.

101
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,280
Sir.

102
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:07,287
Mr. Minister, the role of
the police is being questioned..

103
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,552
...what are your comments on it?

104
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:11,151
I've organized
a Special Task Force.

105
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,128
And Commissioner Panth
is heading this team.

106
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:15,688
What?

107
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:16,990
Don't worry, sir.

108
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,160
We'll find the Collectors.

109
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,532
I am there. - I see.

110
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,161
Jai Hind, sir.

111
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,398
We just received news, sir.

112
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,133
All the Collectors have returned..

113
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,105
...to the places from
where they were kidnapped.

114
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,642
Oh..good news.

115
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,500
Let's announce
this quickly. - Sir..

116
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,739
There's a problem.

117
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,005
Only nine of them have returned.

118
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,306
What?

119
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,213
Where's the 10th one?

120
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,042
Bribe has
become like an offering.

121
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,683
It's become a necessity to
offer one before doing anything.

122
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,244
Every Legal Department..

123
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,755
"Has turned the life of
every common man like a newspaper.

124
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,316
It starts with turning
the pages on the commode.

125
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,049
And by nightfall"

126
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,422
...it's lying in some
corner like waste.

127
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,123
But no more.

128
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:27,264
Every Friday, one government
officer will be relieved.

129
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,704
Either from corruption,
or this world.

130
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,370
And yes..

131
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,775
I am neither
legal..nor illegal.

132
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,318
I am not
a politician..nor terrorist.

133
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,748
Deeds of
a hero..name of a villain.

134
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,685
I am..Gabbar.

135
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,720
Gabbar.

136
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,354
Everyone's
deed will be revealed.

137
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:57,257
You see..Karma
cannot be bribed.

138
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,265
This CD shouldn't
leak out at any cost.

139
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,739
Just now a person called Gabbar
has sent a CD to our channel.

140
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,738
Let's hear what's on the CD.

141
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:07,739
This is the CD of Gabbar..

142
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,172
...which is available at
every corner of the country.

143
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,612
Look at the huge crowd..

144
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,648
...which has gathered
around to buy this CD.

145
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:12,478
And not just that..

146
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,484
...this video has gone viral
on all social media sites"

147
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,383
...and it's been shared by everyone.

148
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,386
I'm the Gabbar.

149
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:21,220
Will killing a middle-aged
man solve corruption?

150
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,461
No. I think this is right.

151
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,332
Don't you see,
corruption has turned into a race.

152
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:34,070
And anyway, if the winner
gets... in the end..

153
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,040
...then, they will all
start running backwards.

154
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,044
How did those Collectors
take the money..

155
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,046
...what time.. and from whom.

156
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,043
And how they used that money..

157
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,208
...where they invested that money.

158
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,247
He's also got a copy
of their property papers.

159
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,481
Sir, this Gabbar has
done a CBI level inquiry.

160
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,317
Yes, sir.

161
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,654
No outsider can gather
all this information.

162
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,092
Someone's definitely giving
him all this information..

163
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,719
...from inside the office.

164
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,028
Who could it be?
- Sir, it can be someone"

165
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,100
I get it, sir.

166
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,601
I get it.

167
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,099
10 kidnappings. 10 officers.

168
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,708
This means a team of 10 people.

169
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,407
This isn't the job of 10 people.

170
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:20,106
Sadhu, you talk more
than you're paid for.

171
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,317
Tell me something.

172
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,213
How many Collectors in Maharashtra?
- How many?

173
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,050
354.

174
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,424
And how many did they abduct?
- How many?

175
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,790
10. - Yes, 10? So.

176
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,394
One man is enough to plan everything.

177
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,157
But how many men do
you need for the kidnapping.

178
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:40,034
One man alone can't change the tires.
- Correct.

179
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,403
You need at least 2-3
people to abduct someone.

180
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,030
So how many for 10 people?

181
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,374
20-30?

182
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,073
This is the job of an organization.

183
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,239
They don't hide in the
jungles like the Renegades"

184
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,612
...in fact, they're operating
right here from the city.

185
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,379
And you're not doing your job.
- My job?

186
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,786
Get some fritters quickly.
- That fatso will explode someday.

187
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,352
And don't forget the red sauce.

188
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,448
Last time you forgot,
and I had to face the music.

189
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,623
These people will keep
pouring sauce on their fritters"

190
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,029
...and Gabbar will do his thing.

191
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,034
Hurry up,
Adi sir's class is about to begin.

192
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,195
Come on.

193
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,300
Is everyone here?

194
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,541
Let's take attendance.
- Forget it, sir.

195
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,008
There must be more than you expect.

196
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,670
Who would want to bunk your class?

197
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,310
Is that sure? - Definitely.

198
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,246
Fine, let it be.

199
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,776
The world is made of five elements"

200
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,621
...and so is our body.

201
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,521
And similarly,
Force is made of five elements.

202
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,660
Can anyone tell me
what the elements are?

203
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:39,787
No, sir.

204
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,395
No?

205
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,056
Listen carefully.

206
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,529
It's Tension.

207
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,758
Compression!

208
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:46,660
Sheer!

209
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:47,594
Bending!

210
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,364
And..Twisting!

211
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,438
If we translate this in Hindi..

212
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,765
...we'll call it..

213
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:53,703
'Khichav' Tension.

214
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:54,567
'Dabav' Compression!

215
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,301
'Tod' Sheer!

216
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,072
'Mod' Bending!

217
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,808
And.. 'Ghumav' Twisting!

218
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,249
Didn't get it?

219
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:00,977
No, sir.

220
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,986
Well, let me explain it practically.

221
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:12,485
Come on, get lost.

222
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,031
Get lost, college is closed.

223
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,463
Get lost. Come on.

224
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,195
Get lost. Come on.

225
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,664
Young man, come up.

226
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,096
Listen carefully.

227
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,773
Without moving your
feet.. Raise your hand.

228
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,737
Try to push me.

229
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,603
College is closed.

230
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,645
Get lost.

231
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,511
Hey teacher,
college is closed today.

232
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,312
Come on, get out.

233
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,311
Go, 90..

234
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,410
College is closed.

235
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,546
Come on, get out.

236
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:39,248
Come on.

237
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,051
Doesn't this look like..

238
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,489
...two bulls are clashing each other.

239
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,059
This is called 'Compression Load'.

240
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,061
What is it called? Louder?

241
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,597
'Compression Load'. - Perfect.

242
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,189
So first you learned 'Tension Load'..

243
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,460
...and now 'Compression Load'.
- Hey..enough of your antics.

244
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,060
Go back.

245
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,431
Go home.

246
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,468
Come on.

247
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,043
Come with us. Come on.

248
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,067
The college won't shut down.
Who are you?

249
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,273
Some Gabbar has killed the Collector.

250
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,009
This isn't Law and Order.

251
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,550
The Home Minister has to resign.

252
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,552
Until then.. - The exam
schedules are already out.

253
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,181
This college won't shut down.

254
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,688
I see..the college won't close down!

255
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,621
Break everything.

256
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,749
Come on. - Now it will shut down.

257
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,220
We won't tolerate this hooliganism.

258
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,260
You want to see hooliganism"

259
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,691
This is the third Force.

260
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,993
Listen carefully.

261
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,201
When you press something
from both sides"

262
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:28,762
...and put pressure
on its Tension point.

263
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,038
Break it!

264
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,403
Should I break it? - Break it!

265
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,306
Fine, now watch the breaking force.

266
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,571
Break it!

267
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,037
Who are you?

268
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,012
You're done for.

269
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,188
This is Bending.

270
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,618
Now..I'll teach you
about Twisting Force.

271
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,787
Aditya! What are you doing, sir?

272
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,755
I was just taking my class, sir.

273
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,498
Stop it! Leave him!

274
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:02,062
As you all saw,
Physics is useful in everything.

275
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,341
Tension. Compression. Sheer. Bending"

276
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,468
...and the last one,
sorry I couldn't show you.

277
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,409
Twisting.

278
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,078
And listen all of you.

279
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,577
Even the Police aren't
allowed inside this campus.

280
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,717
And you are all goons.

281
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,487
So don't even think
about it next time.

282
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,283
Understand.

283
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,155
What did he say?

284
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,419
Even the Police aren't
allowed inside the campus.

285
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,594
So how did the goons get in?

286
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,497
The college gate
is the problem, right?

287
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,723
What if the gate isn't there anymore?

288
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,224
Break down the gate.

289
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,419
None of you ever went to school"

290
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,448
...that's why you want to
break down this college gate.

291
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:59,119
Come fellas,
it's time for your roll call.

292
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,026
Come on.

293
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,961
What's your age?

294
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,166
What's your age?

295
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,236
What's your age?

296
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,400
I know yours.

297
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:13,374
No, sir.

298
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,002
Sir, he told me to.

299
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:14,432
I will never go near
any college again.

300
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,702
Good boy, you've learnt enough.

301
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,274
-Class dismissed!-

302
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,676
Hey..stop!

303
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,210
Stop!

304
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,023
Madam, are you crazy? - Shut up.

305
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,657
I need your car, just wait.

306
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,466
Come on, hurry up. - Don't worry.

307
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,004
Careful. Slowly.

308
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,035
Madhu, don't worry.

309
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,267
What are you waiting for?
Open the door.

310
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,206
Come on.

311
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,368
It's okay, come on.

312
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,703
Madhu, sit comfortably.

313
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,611
Get to the hospital, okay. - Yes.

314
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,240
Never seen a pregnant lady before?

315
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,249
Let's go quickly.

316
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:02,384
Come on.

317
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,114
Keep breathing, it's all okay.

318
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,052
Come on, fast.

319
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,987
Take the next left.

320
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:09,516
Keep breathing.

321
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:10,525
Right, take a right.

322
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,690
Just a little longer, hold on.

323
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,089
Take the next left.

324
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,324
Look forward, what are you staring at?

325
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,460
We returned home from the party..

326
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,628
...and her labor pains started.

327
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,437
No one's up for doing
a good deed these days.

328
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,404
No one bothered to stop their car.

329
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,231
Thank God you came.

330
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,967
Keep breathing, Madhu.
Keep breathing.

331
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,242
Stop! Stop! Stop!

332
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,508
Stop the car!

333
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,144
I think her water just broke.

334
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,086
I will have to deliver
the baby right here.

335
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,424
Are you a doctor?
- No, I am a lawyer.

336
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,221
But I've done research on Google.

337
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,454
Get down from the car, please.

338
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,327
Are you sure?
- Do I look like I am joking?

339
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,024
Get down from the car.
Get down.

340
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,165
Okay..now, ready?

341
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,035
Come on, keep breathing.

342
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,138
Come on..

343
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,180
Hello.

344
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,182
Yes, Ravi.

345
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,146
Okay ready.

346
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,341
Now push.

347
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,551
Did you prepare the
list for Nagpur and Pune?

348
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,384
Okay.

349
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,447
Keep it ready.

350
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,365
Excuse me, mister.
I need your shirt.

351
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,564
What?

352
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,702
Take off your shirt, quickly.

353
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:40,480
Give it.

354
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,285
Excuse me, mister. Come here.

355
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,105
What's wrong with you?

356
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,545
Come on, we've to get to the hospital.

357
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,173
Come here.

358
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,617
Baby"

359
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,415
Doctor, I cut the umbilical cord..

360
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,288
...with a Swiss army knife,
is that okay?

361
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,291
It's okay. - Okay.

362
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:24,349
Don't worry.. you go.

363
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,622
I hope she's okay, doctor.

364
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,492
Hurry up and take her in. - Okay.

365
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,063
Shruti..how is Madhu? - Don't ask.

366
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,697
I had to deliver the child on the way.

367
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:40,369
I wasn't this tensed
even during my bar exams.

368
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,639
Anyway, everything is okay now.

369
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,306
Oh God, bless that man.

370
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,316
I forgot all about him. Excuse me..

371
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:48,817
Shruti.

372
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,714
Excuse me.. Hello!

373
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,422
I wonder who he was.

374
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,092
Like they say..
This is how Angels come.

375
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,557
He really was an angel.

376
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,697
He's a devil.

377
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,092
The other 9 Collectors
have gone blank..

378
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,528
...like someone's erased
their memory card.

379
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,502
They were locked in
a dark room for three days.

380
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,198
And suddenly they were released.

381
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,536
Now nobody's uttering a single word.

382
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,007
Sir, these are officers.

383
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,339
We can't be strict with them either.

384
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,310
I don't want to hear this or that.

385
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,277
If someone's got an idea,
then speak now.

386
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,043
Sir. Sir.

387
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,026
Why are you raising your hand?

388
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,723
Sir was asking if
someone's got an idea.

389
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,128
Who are you? - Constable Sadhuram.

390
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,063
I am Yadav sir's driver.

391
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,758
I brought his medicine. Digestion.

392
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,032
So why did you raise your hand?

393
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,037
Sir, I have an idea.
- I've got 'Airtel'.

394
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:41,594
Come here.

395
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,471
Come here.

396
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,606
Bravo.

397
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,509
You brought my medicine, didn't you?

398
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,043
Now get us some fritters.

399
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,513
Yes. - Run along.

400
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,381
Sir, in every office.. - Hey, Sadhu.

401
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,746
You're a driver, aren't you?
So act like one.

402
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,414
Drive the car,
don't rack your brains.

403
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:04,015
Sir, I was just"
- Hey..do you think you're James Bond.

404
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:05,686
Did you ever take a look
at yourself in the mirror?

405
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,296
Get out, come on.

406
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:08,729
Get lost..

407
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:12,261
Sir, if you just listen to me..
- Have you gone deaf?

408
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,166
Get out.

409
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,998
Didn't you hear?
Get out.

410
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:16,697
Sir.

411
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,105
Hey fool, don't forget the red sauce.

412
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,779
My driver's become James Bond.

413
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:30,209
Sadhu!

414
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,015
Sadhu!

415
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,043
Hey, Sadhu!

416
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,420
Why do you lock horns
with these officers?

417
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,016
Officers? My foot.

418
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,390
100 meters in 15 seconds,
can they do it? No.

419
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,725
100% in UPSC, CFPF.

420
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,197
Can they do it? No.

421
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,625
100% of everything.

422
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,565
100 ideas to give my best shot, but..

423
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,393
Bribe wins against talent, so I lost.

424
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,063
Do you get angry in English?

425
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,768
I am not angry.

426
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,335
Law runs through my blood.

427
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,442
All my ancestors were in the police.

428
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:59,607
I was selected for
Sub-Inspector, but..

429
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,607
"Since I couldn't pay bribe,
I became a constable.

430
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,620
But..by solving this case"

431
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,480
...I will earn my cap of an inspector.

432
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,289
How will you solve this case?

433
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,693
It's easy to spot the
anomaly in the crowd.

434
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,394
Meaning?

435
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,161
I mean one can easily
spot the honest one..

436
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,394
"Amongst the corrupt ones.

437
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,435
I will go to every office
and find that one man.

438
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,037
You're a driver,
why would they send you?

439
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,166
I will take a medical leave.

440
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,570
Medical leave?

441
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,608
One small lie is okay
for exposing a big truth.

442
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,442
Gabbar.

443
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,011
I'll get him behind bars.

444
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,024
Shruti madam, what have you done?

445
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,455
You put a dent
on the boss' new car.

446
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,518
What? Why are you screaming?

447
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,257
He won't spare us.
We will all lose our jobs.

448
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,094
I didn't do anything.
Why are you screaming?

449
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:23,632
What happened, driver?

450
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,032
Sir, Shruti madam slammed
into your parked car.

451
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:27,202
I was drinking tea.

452
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,397
I saw it with my own eyes.

453
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,363
No, sir.

454
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,429
Why don't you
learn to drive first?

455
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:32,406
Look at this dent.

456
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,704
You put a dent on my car,
now you will have to pay.

457
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,575
Sir, I didn't put a dent
on your car..so why should I pay?

458
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:39,445
My driver saw you,
with his own eyes.

459
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,550
Eyes can be deceived too, sir.

460
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,209
I can prove that I didn't do it.

461
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,346
Give me two minutes, sir.
- Fine. I'll give you two minutes.

462
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,213
You saw me put a dent on this car?
- Of course.

463
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,055
You did it. - Not at all.

464
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,561
You took the car outside
and got this dent somewhere else..

465
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:53,721
...and now you're blaming me.

466
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:56,391
Sir, three days ago he wanted
to borrow 500 rupees from me..

467
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:57,592
...to which I clearly refused.

468
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:58,691
Did you not?

469
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,668
Sir, I..
- Sir, according to Google"

470
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:04,332
...80% men think women
don't know how to drive.

471
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,740
That's why his testament
cannot be accepted..

472
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,137
...because he's bias
against women drivers.

473
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,736
Sir, I am innocent.

474
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,106
Absolutely innocent.

475
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,582
Sir, I know who put
a dent on your car. - Who?

476
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:15,709
She did. - Her?

477
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,215
Yes. - When did you see me do it?

478
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,722
When you were driving
your scooty at 45 kmlh.

479
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,014
You lost your balance.

480
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,424
You tried to apply the brakes,
but it was too late.

481
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,462
You slammed your
scooty in his car.

482
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,498
You're lying.
What proof do you have?

483
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:29,190
Proof?

484
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,255
Yes. - You want proof?

485
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,027
Yes.

486
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:31,998
Sir, I have a suggestion.

487
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,502
Let's go take
a look at her Scooty.

488
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,437
It must still have
the paint of your car.

489
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:36,164
Come on, sir.

490
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,672
No..no need. - Come on.

491
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:38,298
Come on.

492
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:39,706
Sir..why are you listening to him?

493
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,005
Come on. - He's just a stranger.
Listen to me.

494
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,569
See, sir..didn't I tell you?

495
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,543
I have nothing
to do with this girl.

496
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,015
I don't even know her.

497
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,018
Nor did I borrow
any money from her.

498
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,580
I have no agenda, sir.

499
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,314
2500. - Sir,
that's more than my salary.

500
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,020
All I have is 50 rupees.

501
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:58,390
Sir..

502
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,793
The rest will be deducted
from your salary.

503
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,190
Sir.. - Driver, let's go.

504
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,060
Get lost!

505
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,598
Why did you have to intervene?

506
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,672
Do you know that driver's salary?

507
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:13,433
It's half of what you get paid.
- Oh, you're one of those.

508
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,307
Yes, I am one of those.

509
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,468
Hey, listen.

510
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:18,377
Remember that kid
we delivered in the car.

511
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,015
His naming ceremony is on Friday.

512
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,106
You must come.

513
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:23,017
We delivered a kid?

514
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,478
The one in the car.

515
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,383
We had a kid in the car. - Shut up.

516
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:27,718
By the way, I am Shruti.

517
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,180
Gabbar.

518
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,588
I am back!

519
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:40,499
Our system has become
like children's diaper.

520
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,597
Wet in some places"

521
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,106
...and a little
loose in other places.

522
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:49,243
There's only one
thing we do honestly.

523
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,404
And that's corruption.

524
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:53,309
Releasing this Friday..PWD.

525
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,519
It's actually..the
Public Works Department.

526
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,521
But due to some people..

527
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:02,285
...It's been troubling
people the most.

528
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,991
But now Gabbar will wield his PWD.

529
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,423
"Power-Wale Danda" (The Power Stick).

530
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:10,626
Power in wrong hands
can cause a blackout.

531
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,969
2nd September.

532
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,563
Remember this date.

533
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,003
Because on this day..

534
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,734
...one chair in PWD
will be vacated forever.

535
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,611
Get lost, you dog.

536
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,408
Don't let me see you here again.

537
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,081
It's alright if
you don't want money..

538
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,241
...but don't abuse me.

539
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,682
This is wrong.
- What's wrong, mister?

540
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,543
He's not ready to take bribe..

541
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:32,644
...how will this country run?

542
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,283
Corruption has retired
from this office.

543
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,994
Why is that?

544
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,322
If one man gets a heart-attack..

545
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,427
...everyone in the
neighborhood starts jogging.

546
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,136
Similarly,
since one Collector was murdered..

547
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,563
...all the others
mended their ways.

548
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:49,501
Go..

549
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:51,473
Was everyone here
corrupt before that?

550
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,008
Yes, all of them.

551
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,537
Except for a handful.

552
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,478
Who is that?

553
00:28:56,534 --> 00:29:00,505
Well..like that Anuj More.

554
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,185
Anuj More? Who else?

555
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,590
Everyone? You too?

556
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,526
Yes, Laxmi.

557
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,960
Sadhu, where are you?

558
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:13,960
I am in Sangli.

559
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,591
Gabbar's sent another CD.

560
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,297
"2nd September."

561
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,596
"Remember this date."

562
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,366
"Because on this day.."

563
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:28,241
..."one chair in PWD
will be vacated forever."

564
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,241
"And all you corrupt people.."

565
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:34,006
...if your heart starts
feeling restless..

566
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:38,281
...then know that Gabbar
is somewhere close.

567
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,624
What is his motive?

568
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,555
Who is Gabbar?

569
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,991
I am Gabbar.

570
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,995
This is the film we
should be making, Mr. Producer.

571
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,095
Can we get the rights?

572
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,994
The police couldn't find him,
how can you?

573
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,295
How will you join his group?

574
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:51,766
Tell me.

575
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,594
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

576
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,467
"Be a little scared, son."

577
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,268
"Or Gabbar will show up."

578
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,433
"Do whatever you want."

579
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:02,000
What's wrong, sir?
You look worried.

580
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:03,171
Don't ask.

581
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,343
Who knows which office
Gabbar is going to target next.

582
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,008
It's making me sick.

583
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:09,474
That's true, sir.

584
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:12,052
If they make a list
of our department..

585
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,118
...your name will be on the top.

586
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:16,548
Isn't it?

587
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,159
You had to rub it in, didn't you?

588
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:23,590
I've no clue whether
my BP's getting high or low.

589
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,563
And you're putting
salt on my wounds.

590
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,760
-And that Ramesh
Paw at ..he' s corrupt too.-

591
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,063
Sir, he's got 8.1 billion.

592
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,573
But he's still 100
million short of you.

593
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:35,133
Hey..10 again. - Yes, so?

594
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,181
Well..Gabbar kidnaps 10 people.

595
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,045
Your lucky number is 10.

596
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,480
Shut your mouth!

597
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,619
What about that Raj Naik.

598
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,553
Since the day Gabbar
killed that Collector..

599
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:47,749
...everyone has
stopped taking bribes.

600
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:51,555
Lord..Sai Baba protect me.

601
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:52,526
Hello, sir.

602
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,394
Sir, did you sign my file or not?

603
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,735
We already gave you
15 million in advance.

604
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,431
And here's the
rest of the 15 million.

605
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,196
Thank God you're here.

606
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,037
You gave me 15 million, right?

607
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,108
Hold on.

608
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,004
Here's your 15 million.

609
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,044
Take it back.

610
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:12,045
And come with me. - But..

611
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:13,171
Come on.
Come.. - But listen to me.

612
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:14,576
Come on.

613
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:17,776
Listen, everyone.

614
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,181
Please listen"

615
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,315
It's a question of
my life and death, please.

616
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,683
Look,
someone from this department..

617
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,292
"Has been telling
Gabbar that I take bribes.

618
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,361
And that's
why I have decided..

619
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,195
...that I will
no longer take bribes.

620
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:34,435
I took 15 million
from this contractor..

621
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,630
...to get his job done.

622
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:38,401
And I am
returning his money to him.

623
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:39,407
Here you go.

624
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,611
No, it's okay. - Take it, mister.

625
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,236
Do you want to get me killed?
Take it.

626
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:46,578
I will sign your file,
if it's correct.

627
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:53,351
I will return everyone's
money in cash.

628
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,187
And those who sent
me money from outside"

629
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,091
...I'll send their money
through money-order.

630
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,986
Sir, we have only 24 hours.

631
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,431
There are more than 2000
PWD officers in the state.

632
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,024
We cannot provide
protection to everyone, sir.

633
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,361
But we can protect
corrupt officers.

634
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,196
Correct!

635
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,732
Great idea, sir.

636
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,570
Gabbar will go after them.

637
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,506
Find out who are the
most corrupt officers of PWD.

638
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,512
Sir, no officer will
ever claim that he's corrupt.

639
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:18,410
Correct.

640
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,647
Which fool will admit
that he's a thief?

641
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:23,151
Honestly,
sir, I am the most corrupt officer.

642
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:24,345
I need police protection.

643
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,444
Look,
this is a list of my corruption.

644
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,116
Hey..I've already
completely half century.

645
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,556
50 million.

646
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,525
Sir, please save me.

647
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,493
My name is on the
top of Gabbar's list.

648
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:36,054
Why? Did Gabbar fax you his list?

649
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,064
Sir, please.

650
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,065
Please.

651
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,060
What?

652
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,669
Sir, give me your account number.

653
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,605
I'll give you
half of whatever I have.

654
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:46,073
But enter my name in the
top 10 corruption list, please.

655
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,743
And you want my name to be
on Gabbar's list, instead of you.

656
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,744
Do you think I am crazy?

657
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:50,612
Get in the line.

658
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,377
Sir! Sir!

659
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,574
Sir, while we were busy
giving protection to PWD..

660
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,051
...Gabbar kidnapped
the District Collector.

661
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,611
This was all a distraction, sir.

662
00:32:58,676 --> 00:32:59,416
Oh no.

663
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,622
Alert all the police stations.

664
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,022
Find out where he's keeping
the District Collector, okay.

665
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,389
Sir, what about them?

666
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,224
Collect all their files
and send it to the ACP.

667
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,625
Don't spare anyone.

668
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:11,556
Pawar! Close the gates.
Don't spare anyone.

669
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,697
This is wrong, Thakur.

670
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,400
When he said he will
abduct someone from PWD..

671
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,463
...then, he should've
stuck to his word.

672
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,469
He cheated us.

673
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,136
It's not cheating, Yadav..

674
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,009
...he tightened the
noose around all of them.

675
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:27,016
And..he's Gabbar, not Gandhi.

676
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,525
Do you know who I am?

677
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,525
Gayanand Sawant.

678
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:43,565
Vaibhav Munde.

679
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,033
Parshuram Wadekar. Pramod Naiyyar.

680
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,064
Do you know who they were?

681
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,242
These four are
from the 877 farmers"

682
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:56,676
...who committed suicide last year.

683
00:33:57,301 --> 00:34:01,010
Because the river water
which was meant for them..

684
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:06,313
"Was diverted to the
sugar factory, private sector"

685
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,453
...and the Minister's farmhouse.

686
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:14,588
And their fields remained dry.

687
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,229
And in return..

688
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:21,437
...you..received 180 million!

689
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,494
I did exactly as the
Minister asked me to do.

690
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,173
The Minister
was the one who paid me.

691
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,731
Why should I
care about the Minister?

692
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:33,038
Most of the politicians
in this country are illiterate.

693
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,378
They are criminals.

694
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,043
But you're a Collector.

695
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,552
You were educated.

696
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,545
You swore to serve the people.

697
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:41,749
What were you doing?

698
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,253
You very well know..

699
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,760
...you could've saved
all those farmers lives.

700
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,796
But what did you do?

701
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,301
You took bribe from the Minister.

702
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:57,604
Now you have to take..what
lam giving you.

703
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,267
Listen to me..
Please. Please.

704
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,469
Please, don't do this.

705
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,207
Give me one chance.

706
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,475
I swear I won't take bribes again.

707
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,175
Sir, please"

708
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,612
lam sorry, sir.

709
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,617
The new password
for making mistakes.

710
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,615
If sorry could fix everything"

711
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:20,458
...then there would be no courts,
or police stations.

712
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,156
I hate sorry's.

713
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:27,434
Why was a government
officer hanged publicly?

714
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,096
The hanging has
created a lot of stir..

715
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,639
...In the state of Maharashtra.

716
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,574
The police haven't
found any clue yet.

717
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,372
There's terror in the city.

718
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,003
Government officers
are clearly in fear.

719
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,638
There's a stir amongst
the government officer.

720
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,050
You were on the way,
when we first met.

721
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:51,049
We've a big contribution
in your birth.

722
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,693
Yes.

723
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,058
Yes, baby.

724
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,467
This is a small
token on my behalf.

725
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:00,501
How cool, Adi.

726
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,400
Do you like it?

727
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,462
May I? - Of course.

728
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,508
Okay"

729
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:09,636
There you go.

730
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:11,411
Okay.

731
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,346
Please come here, Madhu.

732
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,158
Return gift.

733
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,993
Oh my baby.

734
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,528
Take off your clothes. - Huh?

735
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,039
Take off your shirt.

736
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,042
Every time we meet,
why do you make me take off my shirt?

737
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,270
Take it off.

738
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,215
Are you a murderer?

739
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,021
What?

740
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,619
You must do something similar.

741
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:00,961
I didn't understand.

742
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,197
This scar.

743
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:04,622
It was an accident.

744
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:06,997
Of course it
was an accident, stupid.

745
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,401
That day when you
were holding the baby..

746
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:09,995
...you had tears in your eyes.

747
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,231
You're so sensitive..

748
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:12,467
...how can you ever kill anyone.

749
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:41,234
"Our eyes are meeting..while
sipping coffee."

750
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:51,743
"Our eyes..are swaying
with the breeze of love."

751
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:59,416
"This feeling right
now..feels really great."

752
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:03,254
"It's the intoxication
of first love."

753
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,520
"..of first love."

754
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,222
"It's a new experience."

755
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,993
"My eyes convey.."

756
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,557
"Come dwell in my sights."

757
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,126
"Even if you have to
steal my slumber away."

758
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,695
"Hey O.."

759
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,466
"Hey O..l am in love."

760
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:25,503
"It's the intoxication
of first love."

761
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:28,243
"Hey O.."

762
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,219
"Hey O..l am in love."

763
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:36,156
"It's the intoxication
of first love."

764
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:01,580
"My breath is suddenly rising."

765
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,478
"The eyes express.."

766
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,182
That's right.

767
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,724
"My breath is suddenly rising."

768
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,292
"The eyes express.."

769
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:18,061
"..your interest
in me is growing."

770
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:23,128
"This feeling right
now..feels really great."

771
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:27,142
"It's the intoxication
of first love."

772
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,438
"Of first love."

773
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,002
"It's a new experience."

774
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,639
"My eyes convey.."

775
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,344
"Come dwell in my sights."

776
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,751
"Even if you have to
steal my slumber away."

777
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,547
"Hey O.."

778
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,422
"Hey O..l am in love."

779
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,723
"It's the intoxication
of first love."

780
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,396
"It's the intoxication
of first love."

781
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:54,453
"Our eyes are meeting..while
sipping coffee."

782
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:09,712
"Our eyes..are swaying
with the breeze of love."

783
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:15,248
Do you know why you can't
walk straight after drinking?

784
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:16,782
Why?

785
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:18,218
Because the feet say..

786
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,450
You picked up the
glass with your hand..

787
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,155
"Gulped it down the throat,
gave a hangover to your brain..

788
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:21,753
...but you never asked us.

789
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:22,588
We won't walk.

790
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:24,725
You're crazy.

791
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,465
Absolutely crazy.

792
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:31,266
You know, you don't just
treat me to good liquor..

793
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:34,065
...you're also a nice guy.

794
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,041
We at the bottom always know..

795
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:37,670
...how to grease
someone's palm, right?

796
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,313
Yes.

797
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,650
When the Collector died..

798
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,186
...all the police officers
came to our office.

799
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,080
I was right there. - I know.

800
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,721
But no one asked me anything.

801
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,483
Nothing.

802
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,355
Nonsense"

803
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:55,261
Pappu..this is a list
of your office staff.

804
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:59,094
Now tell me..who
scrapes the most icing.

805
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:02,330
Like Vijay Mathur, Rakesh Kamble..
- This..

806
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,033
Vijay Mathur. - Vijay Mathur.

807
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,541
He recently bought a big car.

808
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,043
This big. - I see.

809
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:09,770
Yes.

810
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,241
He gave 150 kilos of gold
in his daughter's marriage.

811
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,284
150..

812
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:20,655
This..this,
this..this..All of them.

813
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:22,146
They are all corrupt.

814
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,016
No..

815
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:26,028
This..no.16..
Wasim.. - Wasim Sheikh.

816
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:26,755
Wasim Sheikh.

817
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:31,030
Honest. - Really.

818
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,363
But..

819
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:35,196
This Wasim Sheikh,
he's a great guy.

820
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,404
But you know,
he'll starve to death.

821
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,269
Starve to death.
- Yeah, take it from me.

822
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,571
He'll starve to death someday.

823
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,751
Wasim Sheikh.

824
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,784
Wasim Sheikh..honest officer.

825
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,048
Nashik.

826
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,756
Varsha Raje.

827
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,164
Anuj More.

828
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:04,997
Gobind Gawde.

829
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:08,193
How did they form a team?

830
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,401
Did you know that a man's brain..

831
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,238
...Is 10% bigger
than a woman's brain.

832
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:15,135
Really?

833
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,007
Excuse me.

834
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:18,144
Hey..hello. Wait.

835
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:22,010
But according to Google,
the female brain works faster.

836
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:23,747
You and that Google.

837
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,249
You know, there should be..

838
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,414
...a Google temple right
beside Babulnath temple.

839
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:28,320
Hail Google-nath!

840
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,323
Hail Google-nath! - Shut up.

841
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,621
According to Google,
12% of road accidents"

842
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,457
...occur because people
use their mobile phone..

843
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,069
So many tests for a minor injury.

844
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:45,538
Is it really necessary?

845
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,231
Get these tests done..

846
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,039
"Otherwise you're
going to blame us.

847
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,076
No, ma'am,
nobody is going to blame you.

848
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,379
All I wanted to say was"

849
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:54,711
...I was right there
when the accident happened.

850
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:55,773
It was not a major accident.

851
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,417
Then why did you come here?

852
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,055
You could've
bandaged that at home.

853
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:02,983
This is the problem
with educated people today.

854
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:04,549
They think they're doctors.

855
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,656
Doctor, they're insisting
on a normal delivery.

856
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,996
You've been working
here for so many years..

857
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,401
...but you still don't know
how to talk to the patients.

858
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:19,536
Tell him caesarian
is absolutely safe.

859
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,167
It's safe.

860
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:23,309
But doctor,
they're willing to wait..

861
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,438
...until it's
not a normal delivery.

862
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:30,309
How will the hospital make
money if it's a normal delivery?

863
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,047
And how will we pay your salary?

864
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,520
Normal delivery is not possible.

865
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,022
You must go for C-section.

866
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,559
If they wait,
we will not be responsible.

867
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,788
Tell them some big medical terms.

868
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:50,034
Ma'am, you still have
to pay 70,000 rupees.

869
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,801
But I paid 70,000 yesterday.
- Thank you.

870
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:56,439
Look. - No, ma'am.
Actually, they were room charges.

871
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,568
Give that to uncle.

872
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,448
Let's go see mom, huh!

873
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,016
Vivek, sir.

874
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:05,251
601.

875
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,084
Did he pay the bill? - Yes, sir.

876
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:08,187
Give him the slip.

877
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,488
You can claim your wife's
body by showing this slip.

878
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:14,993
Okay?

879
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:17,198
Body? Why are you saying that?

880
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:20,028
Your wife passed away last night.

881
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,026
Passed away?

882
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,536
When?

883
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,669
I was right here
last night with my kid.

884
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,537
Why didn't you tell me?

885
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,312
She could've at least
seen her mother one last time.

886
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,675
In the morning you
sent me to get money.

887
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,014
And when I returned..

888
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,145
...you made me stand
in the payment queue.

889
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,011
You didn't tell me she's dead.

890
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,784
Look, my job is to keep
an account of the money.

891
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,382
Not the patient.

892
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,117
And anyway,
we disclose this information..

893
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,594
...after all the bills are settled.

894
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:48,789
Otherwise,
people like you would leave..

895
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,396
...without paying the Bills.

896
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,058
What..

897
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,526
She was dead last night.

898
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,070
And they didn't
tell me she's dead.

899
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:00,230
For the past one week..

900
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:01,640
...I paid you every
penny you asked for.

901
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,106
Here.

902
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,645
Take some more.

903
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,208
Take all of it.

904
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,451
Can you let my child
see her mother one last time?

905
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:12,282
Look, mister, this is a hospital.

906
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:13,446
Please don't create a nuisance.

907
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,580
Shut up!

908
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:19,325
Those are the rules here.

909
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,623
If you've got a problem..

910
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:22,994
...then you can go to the
government hospital next door.

911
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,667
Rs. 12,000.
I could've used this for shopping.

912
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,296
I could've done many other things.

913
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,600
Go ahead, I'll join you.

914
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,539
Where are you going?
- There's something I need to do.

915
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:34,575
Take madam to Versova.

916
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:35,473
Go on.

917
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:41,472
Balram Nagpal.

918
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,516
You're his wife, aren't you?

919
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,053
Sign here.

920
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:47,010
Sign here, aunty.

921
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:48,523
Only then will you
get his death certificate.

922
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,489
Here.

923
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:51,556
Fine.

924
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:52,522
Give it.

925
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,195
Give this at the cremation ground.

926
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:55,421
Come on.

927
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:58,222
He gambled away everything we had.

928
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,999
How will I raise these two now?

929
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,530
Oh Lord!

930
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:06,663
Oh Lord!

931
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:09,241
Oh Lord!

932
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:13,974
The Lord doesn't
do everything Himself.

933
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:18,009
He leaves some things
for devils like us.

934
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:25,992
Doctor.

935
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,155
Doctor. Please save him.

936
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:29,253
He fell from the 3rd floor..

937
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:30,127
...and he isn't
speaking since then.

938
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:31,257
Please save him at any cost.

939
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:32,595
Nurse, take him to
the emergency ward.

940
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:34,033
And you,
first pay the admission fee. Quickly.

941
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,034
Don't worry about the money.

942
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,001
-I'll- pay everything.

943
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:36,697
Just save him at any cost.

944
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,205
Don't worry, relax.

945
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,211
Did your husband
have insurance? - No.

946
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,645
Come, let's get one now.

947
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:53,714
He's dead.

948
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,148
He's already dead, doctor.

949
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,255
But they don't know this.

950
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,990
He's alive until they
have money in their pockets.

951
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:07,193
Here's the bill.

952
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,502
What is the patient's name?
- Balram Nagpal.

953
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,631
Start treatment.

954
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:11,632
Begin.

955
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,435
His condition's very serious.

956
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,739
Get these medicines
and injections"

957
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:18,537
...from the pharmacy immediately.

958
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:19,512
Quick, quick, quick.
- Where's the pharmacy?

959
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:20,378
On the right.

960
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:22,983
Nurse, get me an oxygen
cylinder right now.

961
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,210
7,300.

962
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,144
Make the bill in the
patient's name. - Yes.

963
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,746
Balram Nagpal. - Okay.

964
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,216
What took you so long?

965
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,420
Don't you know it's an emergency?

966
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:35,520
I didn't know my brother's
in such a serious condition.

967
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:36,462
Can I see him?

968
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,193
Please do not disturb
the doctor, okay.

969
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:39,427
Go and sit there.

970
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,263
Here, another lot.

971
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,303
Go give it back to the chemist.

972
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:49,473
Hey, take this.

973
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:50,575
Maintain a proper record.

974
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,739
You're always sore when
it comes to commissions.

975
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:57,176
I never lie, dear.

976
00:47:58,775 --> 00:47:59,776
Excuse me.

977
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,484
Please come. - Yes.

978
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:05,454
Look, his condition
is getting worse.

979
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:06,592
It's a hemorrhage.

980
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,960
I think we need to
call a neurosurgeon.

981
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,662
You can call God if you want,
just make him better.

982
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,996
Are you sure? - Sure.

983
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,398
His fee is 200,000!

984
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:17,001
It's okay,
I'll arrange for it. - Okay.

985
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,971
Nurse, call Dr. Verma.

986
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:20,439
Okay.

987
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,273
Make the bill in the name
of the patient, Balram Nagpal.

988
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:27,178
Yes.

989
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,616
Doctor..

990
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,620
The Specialist is here.

991
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:42,629
We'll save him.

992
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,027
Yes.

993
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:49,226
What kind of people are they?

994
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,435
They don't even spare the dead.

995
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:55,502
Just wait and
watch what they do next?

996
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,106
You guys will get
me in trouble someday.

997
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:02,247
This body is
starting to decompose.

998
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,043
We can't keep up
this act for too long.

999
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,610
Sir..when he's willing to pay..

1000
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:09,681
...we'll milk him all we can,
and take our share.

1001
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,427
Let's start with the
charade before it's too late.

1002
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:36,981
This act will end soon.

1003
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,022
Do you know how to
shoot a video with a phone?

1004
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:48,118
Yes.

1005
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,031
The doctor will
come out any moment.

1006
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,995
Focus only on him.

1007
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:58,300
He'll come out with a long face.

1008
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:02,303
He'll say "I'm sorry,
the patient is no more".

1009
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,170
"I wish you had
informed me earlier."

1010
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,207
Excuse me. - Doctor.

1011
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,183
I am sorry,
the patient is no more.

1012
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,712
I wish you had
informed me earlier.

1013
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:17,282
Doctor, please try again.

1014
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,418
Try to understand, he's dead.

1015
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:20,689
Sir, you're a specialist.

1016
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,597
Please try once.

1017
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,029
What are you saying?

1018
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:25,260
How can he treat him?

1019
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:26,426
He's dead.

1020
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,367
Why? Can't the dead
be treated? - What?

1021
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:29,669
Obviously.

1022
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:31,467
How can anyone treat the dead?

1023
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,302
Why not?

1024
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,306
This is Patil Hospital.

1025
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,536
The dead can be treated here.
- Are you crazy?

1026
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,738
Who can treat the dead? - Why not?

1027
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:38,438
Am I crazy?

1028
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:40,175
Look. Read this.

1029
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:41,643
What's written on it? Read it.

1030
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,048
Municipal Hospital?

1031
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,148
Dr. Deshmukh certifies
death at 11:25 am.

1032
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,315
Patient's name..Balram Nagpal.

1033
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,618
When the patient's already dead..

1034
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:57,263
...what were you all
doing in there for 6 hours?

1035
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:01,324
This isn't just the
patient's death certificate..

1036
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:04,165
...It's this hospital's
death certificate.

1037
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:14,039
You people are an expert
in conning the patients.

1038
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:16,141
Can I get a copy?

1039
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:18,185
How many do you want?

1040
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,717
What happened? Can't breathe?

1041
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:24,486
Should I call a specialist?

1042
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,022
This is your bill.

1043
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,224
Please pay 300,000
at the counter..

1044
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,587
...and collect the body.

1045
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,530
This body won't go anywhere.

1046
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:36,033
Until you don't make a
cheque for 500 million rupees"

1047
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:38,237
...in the name of Shanti Nagpal.

1048
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:38,773
What?

1049
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,766
Your game is up.

1050
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:42,638
Call your boss.

1051
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:44,044
Come on.

1052
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:45,045
Call your boss.

1053
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:47,309
Come on, out.

1054
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,778
Out!

1055
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:52,782
Out!

1056
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,094
Good shot.

1057
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:02,723
Buy him out!

1058
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:04,998
How much is he asking for?

1059
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:08,026
He's a little cynical, sir.

1060
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:09,495
No one knows him.

1061
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:11,672
All he keeps saying is..

1062
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:13,732
...I want to see your MD.

1063
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:15,442
I'll talk to him about the money.

1064
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:25,050
Hello.

1065
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:28,112
Dad, there's..a small problem.

1066
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,151
You expect me
to fly back from Dubai..

1067
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:31,317
...to solve your small problem?

1068
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,024
When will you ever grow up?

1069
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,555
It's your problem,
you deal with it.

1070
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:41,401
Call him.

1071
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:49,739
So you want 500 million rupees"

1072
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,039
...in exchange of all the evidence.

1073
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:54,310
Cheque for 500 million,
in the name of Shanti Nagpal.

1074
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,476
Wife of late Balram Nagpal.

1075
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:03,116
Rs. 450,475 which I spent, cash!

1076
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,707
Breaking your
pride is much more fun..

1077
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:23,604
...than breaking bones.

1078
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:27,772
Better pay up quietly..

1079
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:35,021
"Otherwise I'll get
this place sealed up.

1080
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,220
Sir, this is a cheque
for 500 million..

1081
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:41,023
...and the rest of the cash.

1082
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:47,460
Here.

1083
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,467
Your husband's insurance cheque.

1084
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:55,334
I know this cannot
fill in the void.

1085
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,339
But it can make
life a little easier.

1086
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,146
Take it.

1087
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:02,644
Thank you.

1088
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,746
My husband's death did..

1089
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,113
...what he couldn't
do when he was alive.

1090
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,031
You are doctors.

1091
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:25,501
It's your duty to serve people,
not con them.

1092
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:27,369
Shame on you all.

1093
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:29,032
I am sorry.

1094
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,478
I just hate sorry's.

1095
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:56,160
Shut it down!
- Shut down Patil Hospital!

1096
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:59,503
Shut it down!
- Shut down Patil Hospital!

1097
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,341
Sir, that guy double-crossed us.

1098
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:06,574
He took money from us..

1099
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,343
...and also gave the
evidence to the media.

1100
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,016
Move away. You idiots.

1101
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:15,679
How the hell can
they enter my property?

1102
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,348
I won't spare them.

1103
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:20,423
Sir..sir..

1104
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:25,731
Get out from my property.

1105
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:27,598
Move.

1106
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,326
Just back off!

1107
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:58,630
-Let's go home boss.-

1108
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:00,029
Boss, the body..

1109
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,001
I mean Vikas
has been brought home.

1110
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:03,562
Let's go home.

1111
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:04,730
Please. - Shut up.

1112
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,336
You do know who I am.

1113
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:09,609
Patil.

1114
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,738
-Digviï¬‚ay Patâ€œ.-

1115
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,107
lam a brand!

1116
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:16,584
I am a brand!

1117
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:19,677
First he killed my son..

1118
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:23,751
...and also
challenged my reputation.

1119
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:26,154
I want him.

1120
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,018
I will first kill him..

1121
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:33,496
...and then cremate my son's body.

1122
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,503
Sir, many have seen his face.

1123
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,006
But no one knows
anything about him.

1124
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,172
So he just came and left
after ruining everything.

1125
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,609
And you don't know anything.

1126
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,579
And that woman,
who he gave the 500 million..

1127
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:48,047
"Doesn't know him either.

1128
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:49,372
She was saying that..

1129
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:51,146
...she met her at
the Municipal hospital.

1130
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:55,151
Sir..he must be on the
hospital's CCTV camera.

1131
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,530
What's the
connection between them?

1132
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,461
Relatives" - What, sir?

1133
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,731
You see, whenever I
need some expert advice..

1134
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,404
...I talk to myself.

1135
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:18,234
What's up, guys?
- How are you all?

1136
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:19,470
Good! Good! Good!

1137
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,713
Are you all going
for the college reunion?

1138
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:23,416
Yes.

1139
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:25,009
We're all meeting after three years.

1140
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:27,447
Everyone is busy with their jobs.
We hardly see each other. - Wait.

1141
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:28,986
Yes.

1142
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:31,583
Anuj More. Wasim Sheikh..

1143
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,321
No one's going to
miss the college reunion.

1144
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:34,487
College connection.

1145
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:40,562
There are 48 cameras
in 16 blocks of the hospital.

1146
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:42,134
I'm checking the
tapes of all the blocks.

1147
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,227
Hurry UP-

1148
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,000
If my superiors find out..

1149
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,669
...I've been looking through personal
files of government officers"

1150
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,040
...then I will
definitely lose my job.

1151
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:52,544
But I will get promoted.

1152
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:54,609
Thank you.

1153
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:57,176
Check which college
they all studied at?

1154
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,446
Arjun More, Sanghli.

1155
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:00,083
Wasim Sheikh, Nashik.

1156
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:02,147
Varsha Raje, Latur.

1157
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:03,516
Milind Sangvi, Dhule.

1158
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:08,725
Sir, he paid 4,60,000
at the cash counter.

1159
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:10,295
What time?

1160
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:11,491
At around 11:30am.

1161
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:12,658
So why are you
showing us all this.

1162
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,230
Play the tape from 11 am, quickly.
- Yes, sir.

1163
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,437
Find out the
connection between them.

1164
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,440
Arun More, AV college"

1165
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,538
Wasim Sheikh, MG college.

1166
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:23,635
Varsha Raje, Garge college.

1167
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,980
Milind Sangvi, Hindu college.

1168
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,379
They are all
from different fields.

1169
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:29,280
What could be the common
connection between them?

1170
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:31,009
This is their post-graduation.

1171
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:32,982
Search from where they
did their graduation.

1172
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,352
You will get me into trouble..

1173
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,014
Forget the job, come on.

1174
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:43,655
Fast-forward.

1175
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:45,497
Yes.

1176
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:46,659
That's the man, sir.

1177
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,431
Rewind!

1178
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:56,302
National College.

1179
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,344
National College.

1180
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,538
National College.

1181
00:58:58,601 --> 00:58:59,477
National College.

1182
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:02,216
They all did their graduation
from National College.

1183
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,716
All these honest people..

1184
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,445
...have branched
out from this tree.

1185
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:14,228
And the root of this
tree.. that Gabbar.

1186
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,428
Is from this National College.

1187
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:22,562
Zoom.

1188
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:25,299
Zoom in.

1189
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:27,569
Stop!

1190
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:35,380
This isn't possible.

1191
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:40,421
I killed this man five
years ago with my own hands.

1192
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:54,904
Hey Sadhu, buddy.

1193
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,304
Welcome back.. - $0..

1194
00:59:57,363 --> 00:59:59,309
You know, since the day you left..

1195
00:59:59,365 --> 01:00:02,005
...I had to put up with all
that fritter and red sauce crap.

1196
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:03,872
You don't know.

1197
01:00:03,936 --> 01:00:05,609
He'll soon apprehend Gabbar.

1198
01:00:05,671 --> 01:00:06,615
He's got a solid lead.

1199
01:00:06,672 --> 01:00:08,276
Congratulations.

1200
01:00:08,307 --> 01:00:09,615
If I get another week's leave..

1201
01:00:09,675 --> 01:00:10,949
...I'll bring Gabbar
back on this scooter.

1202
01:00:12,645 --> 01:00:14,886
Look, I've thought of
a great plan to catch Gabbar.

1203
01:00:15,948 --> 01:00:17,791
There's a honest officer
in every office..

1204
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:18,851
...who gives information to Gabbar.

1205
01:00:18,917 --> 01:00:20,055
Right?

1206
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:21,889
What..

1207
01:00:21,954 --> 01:00:24,594
Look..the senior's junior is the
most brain at work.

1208
01:00:24,957 --> 01:00:26,061
We're already across interval..

1209
01:00:26,292 --> 01:00:27,430
...and they are still stuck here.

1210
01:00:28,327 --> 01:00:30,307
They won't be able to figure
it out even after the interval.

1211
01:00:30,562 --> 01:00:32,667
And all the areas in between..

1212
01:00:34,033 --> 01:00:37,742
Welcome, Sadhu.

1213
01:00:37,803 --> 01:00:40,613
Your presence has sanctified
our Police Station.

1214
01:00:40,673 --> 01:00:42,311
Long time no see.

1215
01:00:42,341 --> 01:00:43,046
How are you?

1216
01:00:43,309 --> 01:00:45,016
Sir, I was on a leave for few days.

1217
01:00:45,678 --> 01:00:46,986
Did you go to the mountains?

1218
01:00:47,346 --> 01:00:48,518
If you have finished meditating"

1219
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,854
...can we get some work done here?

1220
01:00:49,915 --> 01:00:51,485
Sir, I need another five days leave.

1221
01:00:52,418 --> 01:00:56,696
Thakur, Gabbar has been
disturbing our department..

1222
01:00:56,755 --> 01:00:59,634
...and Sadhu here needs another leave.

1223
01:01:00,292 --> 01:01:02,033
Are you in your senses?

1224
01:01:02,261 --> 01:01:04,468
Sir, I need leave to catch, Gabbar.
- Shut up!

1225
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:07,306
Have you lost your mind?

1226
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:09,979
You're still hung
over playing James Bond.

1227
01:01:10,469 --> 01:01:13,450
You mean you did
what we all couldn't do.

1228
01:01:13,505 --> 01:01:14,540
You caught Gabbar.

1229
01:01:14,606 --> 01:01:15,516
I haven't yet, sir.

1230
01:01:15,808 --> 01:01:16,684
But I am very close.

1231
01:01:16,742 --> 01:01:17,846
Hey..smarty..

1232
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:20,720
You like playing catch, don't you?

1233
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,521
My wife's dog has been
missing for three days.

1234
01:01:24,283 --> 01:01:25,887
Go catch the dog and bring him back.

1235
01:01:25,951 --> 01:01:28,329
Believe me, sir, I am very close.

1236
01:01:28,721 --> 01:01:30,564
You're testing our patience.

1237
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:33,065
I'll transfer you to a place..

1238
01:01:33,292 --> 01:01:35,704
...where you won't
survive a single day.

1239
01:01:35,861 --> 01:01:36,703
Out!

1240
01:01:36,762 --> 01:01:38,298
Last time, sir.

1241
01:01:38,831 --> 01:01:41,311
Out means get out!

1242
01:01:42,968 --> 01:01:43,969
Yes, Yadav..

1243
01:01:44,703 --> 01:01:46,341
And Sadhu.. - I know, sir.

1244
01:01:46,672 --> 01:01:48,015
Fritters and red sauce.

1245
01:01:48,874 --> 01:01:49,818
Smart boy!

1246
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:54,017
You will definitely win
today's fancy dress competition.

1247
01:01:54,246 --> 01:01:55,418
It's a Maharashtrian wedding.

1248
01:01:55,481 --> 01:01:57,017
Veena and Mark, inter-caste marriage.

1249
01:01:57,249 --> 01:01:58,455
Did you know that
according to Google..

1250
01:01:58,517 --> 01:02:00,394
...16% of the marriages
in India are inter-caste.

1251
01:02:00,452 --> 01:02:01,294
You're absolutely right.

1252
01:02:01,387 --> 01:02:03,389
Your marriage with Google
was inter-caste as well. - Adi.

1253
01:02:03,455 --> 01:02:04,490
Okay.

1254
01:02:05,257 --> 01:02:06,895
Boss, there are 8
million voters in Mumbai.

1255
01:02:07,292 --> 01:02:09,602
But Aditya's photo
doesn't match with anyone.

1256
01:02:10,295 --> 01:02:11,865
I don't care.

1257
01:02:12,264 --> 01:02:13,800
I want him.

1258
01:02:13,866 --> 01:02:16,039
Even my mom and dad
had an inter-caste marriage.

1259
01:02:18,704 --> 01:02:20,274
And their product is me, Shruti.

1260
01:02:20,305 --> 01:02:21,477
And did you know that..

1261
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,520
Sorry.

1262
01:02:36,555 --> 01:02:37,966
Taxi.

1263
01:02:39,024 --> 01:02:40,970
The venue's been decorated
so beautifully, right?

1264
01:02:41,026 --> 01:02:42,733
Yes. Just like when
we were getting married.

1265
01:02:42,795 --> 01:02:44,069
Here, 300 rupees.

1266
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:46,307
If I am late today,
Veena's going to kill me.

1267
01:02:46,331 --> 01:02:48,709
Listen, madam. Take your change.

1268
01:02:49,334 --> 01:02:53,407
Wow! Since when did Mumbai's
Taxi drivers give change?

1269
01:02:53,472 --> 01:02:55,247
Since we don't have
any extra expenses.

1270
01:02:55,741 --> 01:02:58,017
No RTO guy imposes penalty.

1271
01:02:58,243 --> 01:02:59,847
Nor does any constable ask for bribe.

1272
01:02:59,912 --> 01:03:02,791
We don't have to pay for
renewing our permit either.

1273
01:03:02,848 --> 01:03:05,590
Corruption is dead thanks to Gabbar.

1274
01:03:05,784 --> 01:03:07,024
No corruption means"

1275
01:03:07,252 --> 01:03:08,663
...our hard-earned money is enough.

1276
01:03:09,555 --> 01:03:11,034
Keep it.

1277
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:12,266
Thank you, sir.

1278
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,800
This is phenomenal.

1279
01:03:15,861 --> 01:03:17,272
I think I am in love with Gabbar.

1280
01:03:17,296 --> 01:03:18,866
Gabbar is a criminal. - Shut up.

1281
01:03:18,931 --> 01:03:19,671
Sorry.

1282
01:03:19,731 --> 01:03:20,675
Hi! - Sorry.

1283
01:04:20,025 --> 01:04:25,475
"Keep dwelling in me."

1284
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,372
"Make your presence
felt in every breath."

1285
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:39,318
"From dusk to
dawn..you're only for me."

1286
01:04:39,411 --> 01:04:43,450
"Without you..I've nothing."

1287
01:04:43,515 --> 01:04:47,895
"We're separate but our soul's one."

1288
01:04:48,287 --> 01:04:51,325
"Don't ever leave me and go away."

1289
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:58,706
"Our story..is like
the drops of rain."

1290
01:04:59,665 --> 01:05:07,982
"Let our story..pour down like love."

1291
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:15,954
"Our story..is like
the drops of rain."

1292
01:05:16,515 --> 01:05:24,696
"Let our story..pour down like love."

1293
01:05:32,831 --> 01:05:35,368
'Long live..'

1294
01:05:43,942 --> 01:05:52,259
"Look at the blessings
conferred on us."

1295
01:05:52,351 --> 01:06:00,668
"We've found refuge in each other."

1296
01:06:00,726 --> 01:06:08,872
"We've all the.. necessities to live."

1297
01:06:09,835 --> 01:06:17,686
"May everything..stay the way it is."

1298
01:06:17,743 --> 01:06:21,589
"From dusk to
dawn..you're only for me."

1299
01:06:21,913 --> 01:06:25,725
"Without you..I've nothing."

1300
01:06:25,984 --> 01:06:30,558
"We're separate but
our souls are one."

1301
01:06:30,722 --> 01:06:33,862
"Don't ever leave me and go away."

1302
01:06:33,925 --> 01:06:41,707
"Our story..is like
the drops of rain."

1303
01:06:42,401 --> 01:06:50,946
"Let our story..pour down like love."

1304
01:06:52,911 --> 01:06:57,621
"Keep dwelling in me."

1305
01:07:01,253 --> 01:07:07,397
"Make your presence
felt in every breath."

1306
01:07:26,645 --> 01:07:34,427
"The only thing that
happened between us."

1307
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:42,662
"it was love, love and only love."

1308
01:07:43,261 --> 01:07:52,670
"We're so close,
there's nothing missing."

1309
01:07:52,738 --> 01:08:00,316
"May we live together..as
long as we live."

1310
01:08:00,378 --> 01:08:04,224
"From dusk to
dawn..you're only for me."

1311
01:08:04,616 --> 01:08:08,462
"Without you..I've nothing."

1312
01:08:08,653 --> 01:08:12,567
"We're separate but our soul's one."

1313
01:08:13,391 --> 01:08:16,565
"Don't ever leave me and go away."

1314
01:08:16,628 --> 01:08:24,570
"Our story..is like
the drops of rain."

1315
01:08:24,903 --> 01:08:33,516
"Let our story..pour down like love."

1316
01:09:10,816 --> 01:09:13,763
Someone please save me.

1317
01:09:14,219 --> 01:09:15,789
Do something quickly.

1318
01:09:40,812 --> 01:09:42,655
Adi.

1319
01:09:45,884 --> 01:09:47,295
Adi.

1320
01:09:52,657 --> 01:09:56,571
When old liquor and old
memories get to your mind..

1321
01:09:57,462 --> 01:09:59,874
...It makes a man out of control.

1322
01:09:59,931 --> 01:10:02,468
But who is this guy who's
getting so out of control?

1323
01:10:02,534 --> 01:10:04,309
What enmity does he have with you?

1324
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:07,272
Even if the fire's extinguished"

1325
01:10:07,305 --> 01:10:11,981
...there's a spark left somewhere..

1326
01:10:12,844 --> 01:10:14,881
...which can turn into flames anytime.

1327
01:10:17,449 --> 01:10:19,827
Remember our Andheri Building case.

1328
01:10:20,285 --> 01:10:20,695
Which one?

1329
01:10:20,752 --> 01:10:22,026
The one that collapsed five years ago?

1330
01:10:22,954 --> 01:10:24,331
Yes, that one.

1331
01:10:24,689 --> 01:10:29,069
His family was amongst
the people that died.

1332
01:10:29,728 --> 01:10:33,642
Some people get.. too
serious about their family.

1333
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,470
Sir, 212 people died..

1334
01:10:36,534 --> 01:10:39,481
"Because of your building
that collapsed in Andheri.

1335
01:10:39,537 --> 01:10:41,949
And more than 100 people
are in the hospital.

1336
01:10:42,007 --> 01:10:43,543
And sir,
there was a creek at first.

1337
01:10:43,608 --> 01:10:45,645
On your advice, the Corporation
filled up the creek..

1338
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:47,451
...and also passed the
registration of that land.

1339
01:10:47,512 --> 01:10:49,048
After conducting the soil test"

1340
01:10:49,314 --> 01:10:51,920
...we knew that a building that
high won't stand there for too long.

1341
01:10:51,983 --> 01:10:55,988
But on your advice,
we declared it as dry soil.

1342
01:10:58,456 --> 01:11:00,697
Did you call me here
to tell me all this?

1343
01:11:01,927 --> 01:11:03,600
But sir, someone has
to take responsibility"

1344
01:11:03,662 --> 01:11:05,642
...for the inquiry
which has been ordered.

1345
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:08,003
We bribed everyone to keep quiet.

1346
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:10,837
But I wonder where did
this man get all the evidence?

1347
01:11:11,002 --> 01:11:13,744
Who is that man? Call him.

1348
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:16,043
Sir, he's a little cynical.

1349
01:11:16,408 --> 01:11:18,581
His wife was crushed under
the debris of the building.

1350
01:11:18,777 --> 01:11:20,415
Sir, his wife was pregnant too.

1351
01:11:20,745 --> 01:11:22,053
Sir, I'll take care of
all the legal formalities"

1352
01:11:22,314 --> 01:11:23,884
What's his name? - Aditya.

1353
01:11:30,522 --> 01:11:31,899
So, Aditya.

1354
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:33,630
I heard you've been
wielding that file..

1355
01:11:33,692 --> 01:11:34,966
...as a weapon against me.

1356
01:11:35,293 --> 01:11:36,966
Is that right?

1357
01:11:39,898 --> 01:11:43,345
Hey Collector..how much
did you get to pass the tender?

1358
01:11:43,401 --> 01:11:44,846
Sir.. - Say it.

1359
01:11:44,903 --> 01:11:46,780
This is not a sting operation.

1360
01:11:46,838 --> 01:11:48,943
Sir..18 million.

1361
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:52,382
See..9 is his lucky number.

1362
01:11:52,711 --> 01:11:54,657
And he takes only on a Tuesday.

1363
01:11:54,846 --> 01:11:57,417
Hey..how much did you
take for the registration?

1364
01:11:57,649 --> 01:11:58,753
8 million.

1365
01:11:59,918 --> 01:12:01,659
How much did I
pay for that soil test?

1366
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,722
Sir..3.5 million.

1367
01:12:05,256 --> 01:12:07,896
You think they will
lay a finger on me.

1368
01:12:08,293 --> 01:12:11,297
Look, this inquiry isn't
going to help you in anyway.

1369
01:12:11,763 --> 01:12:16,974
The level we're at, we only
hear requests from the common man.

1370
01:12:18,737 --> 01:12:20,444
Not their voices.

1371
01:12:20,905 --> 01:12:22,885
What's done is done.

1372
01:12:23,441 --> 01:12:24,647
There's nothing
we can do about it.

1373
01:12:26,311 --> 01:12:27,949
Fine, I apologize.

1374
01:12:28,313 --> 01:12:29,519
Forgive us.

1375
01:12:29,781 --> 01:12:31,590
Collector, say sorry.

1376
01:12:32,684 --> 01:12:33,424
Sorry.

1377
01:12:33,685 --> 01:12:34,789
Not like that.

1378
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:38,601
Hold your ears
and say it properly.

1379
01:12:39,457 --> 01:12:41,698
Sorry, sir. - That's better.

1380
01:12:42,327 --> 01:12:46,400
We're saying sorry and
you're still staring at us.

1381
01:12:49,634 --> 01:12:52,342
They all work for me, understand.

1382
01:12:53,004 --> 01:12:55,382
You can never harm me.

1383
01:12:56,741 --> 01:12:58,584
-Digviï¬‚ay Patâ€œ.-

1384
01:12:59,377 --> 01:13:01,948
This isn't just a name,
it's a Brand.

1385
01:13:02,013 --> 01:13:03,424
Brand!

1386
01:13:08,019 --> 01:13:09,396
Let's do one thing.

1387
01:13:10,822 --> 01:13:12,631
I'll give you two chances.

1388
01:13:13,458 --> 01:13:17,600
You can call anyone
in Maharashtra you like.

1389
01:13:17,762 --> 01:13:18,934
Go ahead and complain.

1390
01:13:19,731 --> 01:13:20,835
Do it.

1391
01:13:23,268 --> 01:13:24,440
Do it.

1392
01:13:24,969 --> 01:13:26,312
Don't be scared.

1393
01:13:28,773 --> 01:13:30,480
Do you have a phone,
or should I give you mine?

1394
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:39,758
Hello.

1395
01:13:39,918 --> 01:13:40,896
Hello.

1396
01:13:41,286 --> 01:13:42,697
Is this Commissioner's
office? - Yes.

1397
01:13:42,754 --> 01:13:44,700
Can I talk to
the Commissioner? - Yes.

1398
01:13:44,756 --> 01:13:45,063
One second please?

1399
01:13:45,323 --> 01:13:46,859
Is the Commissioner on the line?

1400
01:13:48,793 --> 01:13:50,431
Sir, the building which
collapsed in Andheri..

1401
01:13:50,495 --> 01:13:53,271
"Killing 200 people..was
Digvijay Patil's doing.

1402
01:13:53,331 --> 01:13:54,435
Wrong number!

1403
01:13:59,537 --> 01:14:01,346
Call again. Do it.

1404
01:14:04,709 --> 01:14:05,744
Home Secretary.

1405
01:14:08,346 --> 01:14:08,756
Hello.

1406
01:14:08,813 --> 01:14:10,019
Hello, Mr. Pankaj Tiwari.

1407
01:14:10,281 --> 01:14:10,782
Yes.

1408
01:14:10,882 --> 01:14:12,657
Sir, the building which
collapsed in Mumbai..

1409
01:14:12,717 --> 01:14:14,424
"Was Digvijay Patil's fault.

1410
01:14:14,486 --> 01:14:15,760
I have all the
evidence and files..

1411
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:17,299
My number isn't public number.

1412
01:14:17,522 --> 01:14:18,523
Everyone calls me.

1413
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:19,660
Change my number now.

1414
01:14:20,825 --> 01:14:22,964
All lines in this route are busy.

1415
01:14:23,394 --> 01:14:25,305
Please check the
number you've dialed.

1416
01:14:25,497 --> 01:14:27,374
This number does not exist.

1417
01:14:31,669 --> 01:14:32,909
That's normal.

1418
01:14:33,805 --> 01:14:35,682
I bribed everyone.

1419
01:14:36,674 --> 01:14:39,678
Don't worry, I'll pay you too.

1420
01:14:39,744 --> 01:14:42,054
Look, the Government is giving"

1421
01:14:42,313 --> 01:14:44,623
...2.5 million to all those
who died in that incident.

1422
01:14:45,617 --> 01:14:47,460
You'll get 2.5 million too.

1423
01:14:47,519 --> 01:14:49,021
But actually you should
be getting 5 million.

1424
01:14:49,654 --> 01:14:52,362
The Collector told me
everything about your wife.

1425
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:55,364
So that 2.5 for
the kid too, right?

1426
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:57,862
Forget the Government.

1427
01:14:58,396 --> 01:15:00,706
I'll give you 10 million.

1428
01:15:00,965 --> 01:15:01,943
Happy?

1429
01:15:02,567 --> 01:15:03,910
Take the money.

1430
01:15:04,269 --> 01:15:06,476
Get married again. Get a new wife.

1431
01:15:06,671 --> 01:15:07,775
You're still young.

1432
01:15:07,839 --> 01:15:09,375
So you can have kids again.

1433
01:15:09,507 --> 01:15:11,282
Start a new life.

1434
01:15:12,277 --> 01:15:13,654
Have fun.

1435
01:15:14,612 --> 01:15:16,614
There's no point
in doing all this.

1436
01:15:28,593 --> 01:15:29,765
Take your money.

1437
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:53,954
Open the door.

1438
01:16:58,449 --> 01:17:00,690
I beg you. Spare my life.

1439
01:17:00,885 --> 01:17:02,990
Sorry! Sorry!

1440
01:17:03,388 --> 01:17:04,458
Spare my life.

1441
01:17:04,522 --> 01:17:06,695
I beg you. Please.

1442
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:43,597
I like those who don't like me.

1443
01:17:44,696 --> 01:17:46,801
Such people have courage.

1444
01:17:48,299 --> 01:17:49,676
Ballu. - Yes.

1445
01:17:50,001 --> 01:17:54,472
Find out all the Aditya
that were ever born in India.

1446
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:55,415
Yes. Alright.

1447
01:17:57,675 --> 01:17:58,813
Breaking News!

1448
01:17:58,876 --> 01:17:59,911
BMC attacked by Gabbar!

1449
01:17:59,977 --> 01:18:02,253
Corrupt BMC officer hung to death.

1450
01:18:02,347 --> 01:18:04,884
Hanging of IT officer creates havoc.

1451
01:18:04,949 --> 01:18:06,951
Police to pay Gabbar's tax.

1452
01:18:08,486 --> 01:18:09,590
This is Vijay Sabnis.

1453
01:18:09,654 --> 01:18:11,691
There's a lot
of property in his name.

1454
01:18:11,756 --> 01:18:12,757
Ten in the name of his father.

1455
01:18:12,824 --> 01:18:13,666
Five in the name of his uncle.

1456
01:18:13,725 --> 01:18:14,829
And 15 in the name of Tipsy.

1457
01:18:15,259 --> 01:18:15,896
Who is Tipsy?

1458
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,804
Wife?
- Tipsy is his seven year old dog.

1459
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:21,410
I'm sure she eats
gold biscuits, sir.

1460
01:18:21,566 --> 01:18:22,806
What has the world come to, sir?

1461
01:18:22,967 --> 01:18:24,412
People are doing illegal things"

1462
01:18:24,469 --> 01:18:25,709
...in the name of
the most loyal animal.

1463
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:27,443
Anil.. - Yes, sir.

1464
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:29,910
Slide up his
name from no.6 to no.3.

1465
01:18:29,974 --> 01:18:30,611
Yes, sir.

1466
01:18:30,675 --> 01:18:33,281
Sir, he's got a bungalow
near Pune worth 80 million.

1467
01:18:33,344 --> 01:18:34,288
In the name of Tipsy.

1468
01:18:34,345 --> 01:18:35,949
Slide him to no.2. - Yes, sir.

1469
01:18:37,281 --> 01:18:37,952
Sir.

1470
01:18:38,516 --> 01:18:39,256
Sir.

1471
01:18:39,283 --> 01:18:40,284
Just got the news, sir.

1472
01:18:40,351 --> 01:18:42,854
A CBI officer has been appointed
by the Centre to apprehend Gabbar.

1473
01:18:43,988 --> 01:18:44,966
Kuldeep Pawa.

1474
01:18:45,256 --> 01:18:46,360
Very powerful.

1475
01:18:46,824 --> 01:18:48,030
Gabbar!

1476
01:18:48,926 --> 01:18:49,996
Question mark!

1477
01:18:50,695 --> 01:18:51,765
Who is this Gabbar?

1478
01:18:54,232 --> 01:18:56,234
He kidnapped a Collector
in broad daylight.

1479
01:18:56,768 --> 01:18:58,441
He killed him and hung him!

1480
01:18:58,836 --> 01:18:59,780
And then what?

1481
01:18:59,904 --> 01:19:02,441
A District Collector! BMC Officer!

1482
01:19:02,507 --> 01:19:03,850
Income-Tax officer!

1483
01:19:05,209 --> 01:19:06,244
So many Government officers"

1484
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:07,653
...were killed in broad daylight.

1485
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,655
Months passed away, and..

1486
01:19:11,549 --> 01:19:14,257
I don't have any reason
to understand this.

1487
01:19:14,419 --> 01:19:15,329
Sir!

1488
01:19:15,653 --> 01:19:16,996
Sir, we tried hard.

1489
01:19:17,321 --> 01:19:18,629
Gabbar is very smart.

1490
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:19,825
His network.. - What's your name?

1491
01:19:19,957 --> 01:19:21,334
Sir? - Your name.

1492
01:19:21,392 --> 01:19:24,532
Vishwas Sawant.
- Mr. Sawant can you hear yourself?

1493
01:19:24,662 --> 01:19:26,869
I mean can you
really hear yourself.

1494
01:19:27,632 --> 01:19:29,908
Because for me, it sounds
like a common man's cribbing"

1495
01:19:29,967 --> 01:19:31,378
...not a Police man's statement.

1496
01:19:32,236 --> 01:19:33,374
Sorry, sir.

1497
01:19:33,738 --> 01:19:36,275
You get promotion and
medals only by working hard..

1498
01:19:36,507 --> 01:19:37,884
...not by saying sorry.

1499
01:19:40,545 --> 01:19:42,786
Sir, I need every single
information about this guy.

1500
01:19:44,649 --> 01:19:46,560
Every single detail we have.

1501
01:19:46,617 --> 01:19:49,029
I need every data we have..

1502
01:19:49,287 --> 01:19:50,561
...from a peon to officers.

1503
01:19:50,621 --> 01:19:51,565
Right now. - Sir.

1504
01:19:51,622 --> 01:19:52,566
That's it.

1505
01:19:55,426 --> 01:19:56,496
What?

1506
01:19:58,396 --> 01:20:00,706
I am back! Missed me?

1507
01:20:00,998 --> 01:20:03,842
When 100 people get together
and ruin your life..

1508
01:20:04,001 --> 01:20:05,002
"That's called marriage.

1509
01:20:05,269 --> 01:20:08,648
But when 10 million people
together ruin a country..

1510
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,513
...that's a corrupt Government.

1511
01:20:10,575 --> 01:20:11,280
Absolutely right.

1512
01:20:11,309 --> 01:20:16,054
All the poor get is
rebukes and stones. - Right.

1513
01:20:16,314 --> 01:20:19,523
The currency notes only have
Gandhiji's face, not his stick.

1514
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,559
That's why some people are spoilt.

1515
01:20:21,953 --> 01:20:24,456
The list is ready.

1516
01:20:24,522 --> 01:20:28,334
Let's see whose stars
fall in a quandary this Friday.

1517
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,034
Now, sir.

1518
01:20:31,629 --> 01:20:33,870
How do we find a clue from a CD?

1519
01:20:34,565 --> 01:20:36,636
He openly threatened us.

1520
01:20:37,068 --> 01:20:38,979
How do we arrest a voice, sir?

1521
01:20:39,036 --> 01:20:40,709
We don't have
enough Police force..

1522
01:20:41,339 --> 01:20:43,341
...compared to the corrupt
people in this city.

1523
01:20:43,608 --> 01:20:45,019
And we don't
know which department..

1524
01:20:45,076 --> 01:20:46,578
...he will target this time.

1525
01:20:50,581 --> 01:20:53,357
Sir, Gabbar's CD has
terrorized the entire state.

1526
01:20:53,417 --> 01:20:54,623
What is the Police doing about it?

1527
01:20:54,685 --> 01:20:56,824
I want to assure
everyone through you..

1528
01:20:56,888 --> 01:20:58,731
...that the safety of the
entire state is our responsibility.

1529
01:20:58,789 --> 01:20:59,460
So don't worry.

1530
01:20:59,624 --> 01:21:00,295
Next.

1531
01:21:00,358 --> 01:21:01,962
Gabbar has struck twice.

1532
01:21:02,026 --> 01:21:03,835
But the Police
haven't done anything.

1533
01:21:03,895 --> 01:21:06,774
Look, no one has
to panic or be scared.

1534
01:21:06,831 --> 01:21:08,401
He's taking his glasses
off and wearing it back.

1535
01:21:09,367 --> 01:21:10,869
They're reacting
when it's time for action.

1536
01:21:12,303 --> 01:21:16,308
And especially from a
criminal that hides in shadows.

1537
01:21:16,607 --> 01:21:18,314
He doesn't have the
courage to show himself!

1538
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:20,780
So relax, okay.

1539
01:21:20,845 --> 01:21:22,449
We have everything under control.

1540
01:21:22,647 --> 01:21:24,786
One question please. - Listen sir.

1541
01:21:26,651 --> 01:21:27,925
I want to assure you that..

1542
01:21:27,985 --> 01:21:30,329
...the Police knows
how to do their duty.

1543
01:21:30,388 --> 01:21:31,458
And we are doing it.

1544
01:21:35,893 --> 01:21:37,338
Yes. - Our department, sir.

1545
01:21:37,395 --> 01:21:38,465
We just received news that..

1546
01:21:38,529 --> 01:21:39,803
-â€œGabbar has abducted
Pune's ACP Shushâ€œ Shinde.-

1547
01:21:39,864 --> 01:21:40,467
What?

1548
01:21:40,531 --> 01:21:41,908
Bring sir back to the
Police Station immediately.

1549
01:21:41,966 --> 01:21:43,741
Many Gabbars came and went.

1550
01:21:43,801 --> 01:21:44,802
Sir. - What?

1551
01:21:44,869 --> 01:21:47,315
Sir, Gabbar is abducting
police officers.

1552
01:21:47,338 --> 01:21:47,907
What?

1553
01:21:47,972 --> 01:21:50,009
Sir, we've received
orders to bring you back..

1554
01:21:50,074 --> 01:21:51,781
...to the Police Station
immediately for your own safety.

1555
01:21:53,511 --> 01:21:56,515
Sir, now who will protect you?

1556
01:21:56,581 --> 01:21:57,992
Please come, sir.

1557
01:21:58,749 --> 01:22:02,595
Everyone's requested,
to please help the police..

1558
01:22:02,653 --> 01:22:04,633
...so we can help you in return.

1559
01:22:04,689 --> 01:22:05,895
Please pay attention.

1560
01:22:08,726 --> 01:22:11,002
Hey..why isn't this working?

1561
01:22:11,996 --> 01:22:13,475
You're on the top 10 list.

1562
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:16,906
Sir, Vasai's ACP More's
been kidnapped too.

1563
01:22:16,968 --> 01:22:17,605
Oh!

1564
01:22:17,668 --> 01:22:19,614
Sir, Nagpur.
Tawde has been kidnapped.

1565
01:22:20,304 --> 01:22:22,910
That means"? wickets down.

1566
01:22:22,974 --> 01:22:23,952
Are you playing cricket here?

1567
01:22:24,008 --> 01:22:25,851
Sir.. - He's bowling
and we're batting.

1568
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:27,454
Idiot!

1569
01:22:33,317 --> 01:22:35,695
Sir, four people are still left.

1570
01:22:36,487 --> 01:22:37,795
We're in a race against him.

1571
01:22:39,991 --> 01:22:41,834
Who's the most
corrupt Police officer?

1572
01:22:43,694 --> 01:22:45,037
I know everybody knows.

1573
01:22:46,597 --> 01:22:48,406
Tell me so I can save him.

1574
01:22:50,301 --> 01:22:51,279
Say it.

1575
01:22:52,603 --> 01:22:53,843
Gawre sir. - Who?

1576
01:22:55,373 --> 01:22:56,511
Chandrakant Gawre.

1577
01:22:56,574 --> 01:22:57,746
Yes, it'll be done.

1578
01:22:57,808 --> 01:23:00,482
Tell Jadhav I'm calling.
- Yes, sir.

1579
01:23:00,544 --> 01:23:01,454
Go on.
- Chandrakant Gawre come in.

1580
01:23:01,512 --> 01:23:02,490
Hey you.. - Yes sir.

1581
01:23:02,546 --> 01:23:03,923
See that betel-leaf
guy there. - Yes.

1582
01:23:04,248 --> 01:23:05,727
Tell him to give
my betel-leaf. - Yes.

1583
01:23:05,783 --> 01:23:06,523
Come in. Come in.

1584
01:23:06,584 --> 01:23:07,995
Chandrakant Gawre here.
- Listen Chandrakant Gawre

1585
01:23:08,252 --> 01:23:10,289
You could be the next target.
Be alert.

1586
01:23:12,289 --> 01:23:14,291
I am Chandrakant Gawre, sir!

1587
01:23:15,026 --> 01:23:17,870
Death will have to come
down personally to kill me.

1588
01:23:19,897 --> 01:23:21,570
Chandrakant, be alert.

1589
01:23:21,632 --> 01:23:23,305
I am getting backup force for you.

1590
01:23:24,301 --> 01:23:25,507
Stay alert.

1591
01:23:25,569 --> 01:23:26,673
Do you copy, Chandrakant?

1592
01:23:26,904 --> 01:23:28,315
You don't worry.

1593
01:23:28,606 --> 01:23:29,744
Copy! Copy!

1594
01:23:29,807 --> 01:23:30,979
All stations elert!

1595
01:23:31,709 --> 01:23:33,814
I repeat, all stations elert!

1596
01:23:51,529 --> 01:23:53,509
Copy! Copy!

1597
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:00,746
Don't waste my time.

1598
01:24:00,805 --> 01:24:02,614
Just get here, come on.

1599
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:06,848
What's wrong?

1600
01:24:06,911 --> 01:24:08,288
Get lost, come on.

1601
01:24:09,814 --> 01:24:11,760
Sir, Chandrakant sir
has been kidnapped. - What?

1602
01:24:14,285 --> 01:24:15,389
Alert all check posts.

1603
01:24:15,453 --> 01:24:16,363
Put up check posts everywhere.

1604
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:17,455
Every station.

1605
01:24:17,521 --> 01:24:18,761
Don't let even
a single car through.

1606
01:24:18,823 --> 01:24:19,858
Search every car.

1607
01:24:19,924 --> 01:24:20,595
Search every guy.

1608
01:24:20,658 --> 01:24:22,399
Orders for every check post.

1609
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:23,837
Orders are from Kuldeep sir..

1610
01:24:24,361 --> 01:24:25,305
What in there?

1611
01:24:25,963 --> 01:24:26,941
Grandpa, sir.

1612
01:24:27,298 --> 01:24:27,901
Open it up.

1613
01:24:38,442 --> 01:24:40,820
Hey..stop that black car.

1614
01:24:40,878 --> 01:24:42,380
Don't let it through
without checking.

1615
01:24:42,446 --> 01:24:43,390
Stop him.

1616
01:24:43,447 --> 01:24:45,324
What's going on here?
- We're checking sir.

1617
01:24:45,382 --> 01:24:46,554
You mean you haven't checked yet.

1618
01:24:46,617 --> 01:24:47,322
I am doing it, sir.

1619
01:24:47,384 --> 01:24:49,796
You know he's kidnapped
an officer from our department.

1620
01:24:49,854 --> 01:24:51,265
He could be in that too.

1621
01:24:51,322 --> 01:24:51,959
What's in there?

1622
01:24:52,223 --> 01:24:53,463
Mother? Father? - Grandpa.

1623
01:24:53,524 --> 01:24:54,730
Grandpa? So why are you crying?

1624
01:24:54,792 --> 01:24:56,328
It was his time to go. - Yes.

1625
01:24:56,393 --> 01:24:58,532
Why are you being so emotional?

1626
01:25:01,232 --> 01:25:03,337
How long has he been dead?
- Two days.

1627
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:04,936
Two days? And you're still
carrying the body around.

1628
01:25:05,402 --> 01:25:06,642
Let it through.

1629
01:25:07,238 --> 01:25:10,276
Come on, look there.

1630
01:25:10,341 --> 01:25:12,287
And report me in 10 minutes.

1631
01:25:12,476 --> 01:25:13,546
Start the car.

1632
01:25:31,762 --> 01:25:35,039
You fool..you don't
know who you've abducted!

1633
01:25:35,299 --> 01:25:37,438
I am Chandrakant Gawre!

1634
01:25:37,501 --> 01:25:39,742
Police officer Chandrakant Gawre!

1635
01:25:39,804 --> 01:25:41,806
Let me go.

1636
01:25:41,872 --> 01:25:43,715
You will have to pay a big price.

1637
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:47,580
Yes, Govind.

1638
01:25:47,645 --> 01:25:48,851
Let me go!
- Where are you?

1639
01:25:48,946 --> 01:25:49,924
Okay.

1640
01:25:50,848 --> 01:25:53,328
Let me go.

1641
01:25:53,951 --> 01:25:55,396
Leave me!

1642
01:25:55,719 --> 01:25:56,720
Hold on.

1643
01:25:56,787 --> 01:25:58,994
When will Govind get here?
- He's on his way.

1644
01:26:00,257 --> 01:26:02,464
What will you get by killing me?

1645
01:26:02,526 --> 01:26:04,369
What will you get by killing me?

1646
01:26:04,428 --> 01:26:07,671
You've kidnapped a Police officer.

1647
01:26:11,535 --> 01:26:12,775
After I kill you..

1648
01:26:12,837 --> 01:26:14,646
...your entire department
will be purified.

1649
01:26:15,806 --> 01:26:17,717
It's a proud moment for you.

1650
01:26:17,775 --> 01:26:19,686
And for me, this is enough.

1651
01:26:21,946 --> 01:26:22,856
Who are you?

1652
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:26,256
Ravi, take him inside.

1653
01:26:26,417 --> 01:26:27,418
Come on.

1654
01:26:27,785 --> 01:26:31,927
Come on. - You will pay for this.

1655
01:26:31,989 --> 01:26:33,969
You will pay for this.

1656
01:26:37,928 --> 01:26:41,307
Adi.. you kidnapped
a police officer.

1657
01:26:41,398 --> 01:26:42,741
What the hell are you doing?

1658
01:26:42,867 --> 01:26:44,540
Kidnapping! Murder!

1659
01:26:45,269 --> 01:26:46,509
What are you doing, Adi?

1660
01:26:46,737 --> 01:26:48,011
Who are you?

1661
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:50,810
Gabbar!

1662
01:26:52,243 --> 01:26:54,348
Gabbar? You..

1663
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:59,260
Oh, my God.. How?

1664
01:27:02,386 --> 01:27:07,699
"I didn't see, or think
just lost my heart to you."

1665
01:27:10,861 --> 01:27:12,932
Hey guys come here.

1666
01:27:17,001 --> 01:27:19,345
Take him inside.

1667
01:27:21,238 --> 01:27:23,343
Clean the blood. - Yes.

1668
01:27:24,742 --> 01:27:26,585
Please do this.

1669
01:27:27,378 --> 01:27:28,857
I thought to dedicate
the life o them..

1670
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:31,587
...who save my life.

1671
01:27:31,649 --> 01:27:33,458
The youth has a simple strategy.

1672
01:27:33,517 --> 01:27:34,860
If you like it, then welcome..

1673
01:27:34,919 --> 01:27:36,455
...If you don't, then don't come.

1674
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:38,363
Patriotism boils in our blood.

1675
01:27:38,589 --> 01:27:41,399
But only for IPL,
ISL and Kabbir Leagues.

1676
01:27:41,458 --> 01:27:44,268
Reality shows get more
votes than in elections.

1677
01:27:44,295 --> 01:27:44,932
Why?

1678
01:27:44,995 --> 01:27:46,770
Swami Vivekananda had said..

1679
01:27:46,830 --> 01:27:48,901
"Give me 100 young
men of heart and energy.."

1680
01:27:48,966 --> 01:27:50,877
"..and I shall revolutionize
the entire country."

1681
01:27:50,935 --> 01:27:52,744
I brought this
thought into action.

1682
01:27:53,203 --> 01:27:54,944
After talking to them I realized..

1683
01:27:55,205 --> 01:27:56,616
Some have courage, but no power.

1684
01:27:56,674 --> 01:27:58,210
Some have power, but no courage.

1685
01:27:58,242 --> 01:28:00,381
And if they have both,
there's corruption.

1686
01:28:00,611 --> 01:28:02,454
The entire system
has become a quagmire.

1687
01:28:02,513 --> 01:28:04,823
Everyone knows that
the situation is sad.

1688
01:28:04,882 --> 01:28:08,261
Corruption is slowly turning into
an addiction like anti-depressant.

1689
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:09,662
And then..slow death.

1690
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:10,892
We all decided.

1691
01:28:10,955 --> 01:28:13,731
There's no point organizing
candle rallies later.

1692
01:28:13,791 --> 01:28:16,863
Right now..we'll have
to ignite a fire in our heart.

1693
01:28:16,927 --> 01:28:19,237
We taught good manners to animals.

1694
01:28:19,263 --> 01:28:21,573
It's time to teach
humanity to humans.

1695
01:28:21,632 --> 01:28:23,373
Slowly we grew.

1696
01:28:23,434 --> 01:28:24,674
Our team was ready.

1697
01:28:24,735 --> 01:28:26,339
Just one goal.

1698
01:28:26,403 --> 01:28:27,905
To spread the terror
of Gabbar to an extent..

1699
01:28:27,972 --> 01:28:29,918
...where these
government officers"

1700
01:28:29,974 --> 01:28:32,284
...will think twice even
before taking their salary.

1701
01:28:33,777 --> 01:28:36,917
I am the thread which we needed..

1702
01:28:37,915 --> 01:28:39,019
...to bring these pearls together.

1703
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:40,522
Gabbar!

1704
01:28:41,885 --> 01:28:43,922
Sir..Govind!

1705
01:28:47,658 --> 01:28:49,729
Sir, we've done it.

1706
01:28:49,893 --> 01:28:51,873
On Facebook,
Twitter, News Channels"

1707
01:28:51,929 --> 01:28:55,706
The biggest villain has
turned into the biggest hero.

1708
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,237
Gabbar is trending. No.1.

1709
01:28:58,302 --> 01:28:59,645
The entire world
is talking about him.

1710
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:00,942
And everyone wants to know.

1711
01:29:01,238 --> 01:29:02,979
Everyone has the same question.

1712
01:29:03,474 --> 01:29:04,612
Who is Gabbar?

1713
01:29:05,242 --> 01:29:06,482
Isn't that great news?

1714
01:29:07,244 --> 01:29:08,245
What happened?

1715
01:29:08,345 --> 01:29:09,346
Isn't that great news?

1716
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:10,957
Why isn't anyone reacting?

1717
01:29:12,549 --> 01:29:13,619
Govind.

1718
01:29:14,852 --> 01:29:17,389
The list that we made
for corrupt Police officers"

1719
01:29:18,789 --> 01:29:22,760
...had your father's name on top.

1720
01:29:29,967 --> 01:29:31,275
What do we do?

1721
01:29:31,835 --> 01:29:32,905
What else, sir?

1722
01:29:33,737 --> 01:29:36,513
Collector. District Collector.

1723
01:29:38,275 --> 01:29:39,549
They had kids too, sir.

1724
01:29:40,611 --> 01:29:43,990
One only sees their crimes,
not their kin.

1725
01:29:47,384 --> 01:29:48,988
Not Twitter or Facebook.

1726
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:53,827
You made me realize that
my mission is a success.

1727
01:29:54,958 --> 01:29:56,266
Sir.

1728
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:57,837
When people stand up..

1729
01:29:57,895 --> 01:29:59,932
"Against the crimes
committed by their own kin..

1730
01:30:00,464 --> 01:30:02,637
...then people like
Gabbar are not required.

1731
01:30:03,767 --> 01:30:07,305
This is the idea
I wanted to get through.

1732
01:30:07,504 --> 01:30:08,881
And I have succeeded.

1733
01:30:10,808 --> 01:30:11,582
Good.

1734
01:30:11,775 --> 01:30:12,651
But, sir..

1735
01:30:14,645 --> 01:30:15,988
Is my father here?

1736
01:30:21,318 --> 01:30:22,695
I can't see him suffer.

1737
01:30:24,488 --> 01:30:25,831
He might be bad..

1738
01:30:28,692 --> 01:30:30,296
...but I am his good son.

1739
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:34,338
Am I, Adi sir?

1740
01:30:40,304 --> 01:30:41,908
Gabbar! Gabbar! Gabbar!

1741
01:30:43,006 --> 01:30:44,349
That's all
everyone's talking about.

1742
01:30:44,775 --> 01:30:45,776
And his voice!

1743
01:30:47,744 --> 01:30:48,745
Every time I try to sleep"

1744
01:30:48,812 --> 01:30:50,416
...his voice echoes in my ears.

1745
01:30:51,715 --> 01:30:53,592
I want to know, am I the
only one spending sleepless nights"

1746
01:30:53,650 --> 01:30:55,425
...or does anyone here
share the same empathy?

1747
01:30:56,787 --> 01:30:57,765
Anyone.

1748
01:31:03,293 --> 01:31:04,499
Sir, we're fighting this battle..

1749
01:31:04,561 --> 01:31:06,438
...with only a scabbard,
not a sword.

1750
01:31:06,497 --> 01:31:07,532
Hey..shut up!

1751
01:31:07,931 --> 01:31:08,966
Ignore him, sir.

1752
01:31:09,533 --> 01:31:10,876
He's our local James Bond.

1753
01:31:11,301 --> 01:31:15,613
Son..everyone loves his
smartness and a better job.

1754
01:31:15,772 --> 01:31:17,308
Mind your business.

1755
01:31:17,374 --> 01:31:18,318
That's not all, sir.

1756
01:31:18,375 --> 01:31:19,445
You should hear
the main highlight.

1757
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:21,581
He thinks he
has almost found Gabbar.

1758
01:31:21,845 --> 01:31:23,518
And soon he'll catch him.

1759
01:31:29,486 --> 01:31:31,295
Sir, you will never
be able to catch Gabbar now.

1760
01:31:31,388 --> 01:31:33,299
Hey smarty..shut up.

1761
01:31:33,423 --> 01:31:35,869
Or else I'll fire you.
- Get lost.

1762
01:31:36,426 --> 01:31:39,407
Fire me? I'll resign myself.

1763
01:31:39,463 --> 01:31:40,464
I resign.

1764
01:31:40,531 --> 01:31:41,839
I don't want
to work in an office..

1765
01:31:41,899 --> 01:31:43,071
"That's filled with
arrogant officers like you.

1766
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:44,471
Sadhu"

1767
01:31:44,801 --> 01:31:45,575
What, Sadhu?

1768
01:31:45,936 --> 01:31:48,746
Sir, they think someone
will serve them Gabbar on a plate.

1769
01:31:49,406 --> 01:31:51,408
Gabbar is not an
ordinary kidnapper, sir.

1770
01:31:51,909 --> 01:31:53,388
He's on a mission.

1771
01:31:54,244 --> 01:31:55,746
He's a mission himself.

1772
01:31:55,812 --> 01:31:57,758
Don't forget you're a constable"
- Shut up!

1773
01:32:05,923 --> 01:32:08,494
What else do you know about him?

1774
01:32:09,993 --> 01:32:11,301
Look here, sir.

1775
01:32:11,595 --> 01:32:14,269
A list of Nanded's
Collector office.

1776
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:45,333
Excellent job, Sadhu.

1777
01:32:45,829 --> 01:32:47,934
You've solved
90% of the case.

1778
01:32:48,966 --> 01:32:50,639
By why didn't you
tell anyone until now?

1779
01:32:52,936 --> 01:32:54,506
Sir, I am just a driver.

1780
01:33:06,683 --> 01:33:08,458
Then let's go for a drive, Sadhu.

1781
01:33:19,796 --> 01:33:24,370
Sir, neither Police nor goons
are allowed inside this gate.

1782
01:33:24,768 --> 01:33:26,907
That's the rule of
our National College.

1783
01:33:27,604 --> 01:33:28,844
Is this some kind of a joke?

1784
01:33:29,273 --> 01:33:30,877
Couldn't you vacate the
college before I got here?

1785
01:33:31,375 --> 01:33:32,786
Stop staring at me, get them out.

1786
01:33:32,843 --> 01:33:34,720
Sir. Let it be.

1787
01:33:34,778 --> 01:33:35,984
It will turn into
a big student issue.

1788
01:33:36,046 --> 01:33:38,754
The principal,
teachers, students are crazy.

1789
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:46,596
Okay, we can't go in.

1790
01:33:47,024 --> 01:33:48,799
But we can arrest
those who are outside.

1791
01:33:50,027 --> 01:33:50,437
Yes.

1792
01:33:50,494 --> 01:33:51,564
Get your list.

1793
01:33:52,362 --> 01:33:53,670
Arrest everyone.

1794
01:33:54,231 --> 01:33:55,232
Yes, sir.

1795
01:34:00,237 --> 01:34:01,477
Come here.

1796
01:34:01,538 --> 01:34:03,575
What are you doing sir?
- Come with us.

1797
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:04,641
Catch him.

1798
01:34:04,708 --> 01:34:06,654
What are you doing?
leave me. - Come with us.

1799
01:34:07,644 --> 01:34:09,885
Come with us.

1800
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:13,553
Sit in the car quietly.

1801
01:34:30,367 --> 01:34:34,315
Now Patil's projects seem
illegal because of Gabbar's terror.

1802
01:34:34,738 --> 01:34:36,911
The entire real estate
lobby is worried.

1803
01:34:37,441 --> 01:34:38,818
Because of you all.

1804
01:34:43,747 --> 01:34:47,320
If you like Gabbar's style,
then so be it.

1805
01:34:47,851 --> 01:34:49,797
Gabbar abducted
10 corrupt officers"

1806
01:34:49,853 --> 01:34:51,628
...to get his message through.

1807
01:34:52,989 --> 01:34:54,866
I abducted 10 honest officers.

1808
01:34:57,260 --> 01:35:00,332
Which amongst you is
the most honest officer?

1809
01:35:04,501 --> 01:35:05,411
Come on.

1810
01:35:07,003 --> 01:35:09,677
What is your name?
- Sagar Pandit.

1811
01:35:10,374 --> 01:35:11,682
-Saga: Pandâ€œ.-

1812
01:35:14,277 --> 01:35:15,847
Are you abstinent against money?

1813
01:35:16,813 --> 01:35:18,486
Doesn't your wife make demands?

1814
01:35:18,815 --> 01:35:21,261
"I want this..l want that."

1815
01:35:22,452 --> 01:35:24,261
Would you like a
medal for your honesty?

1816
01:35:35,532 --> 01:35:37,773
If you're of no use to me..

1817
01:35:37,901 --> 01:35:40,404
...you're no good
to this world either.

1818
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:47,711
If you accept bribe,
Gabbar will kill you.

1819
01:35:47,978 --> 01:35:49,582
And if you don't..

1820
01:35:50,714 --> 01:35:52,853
Great, officers.

1821
01:35:53,383 --> 01:35:57,991
Now I don't even need to
pay you for getting my job done.

1822
01:35:58,221 --> 01:36:01,828
Just a little
dose of fear is enough.

1823
01:36:02,459 --> 01:36:03,904
We've been beating
these guys since morning"

1824
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,633
...yet no one's ready to speak up.

1825
01:36:05,695 --> 01:36:07,538
What am I going to
tell the Home Ministry?

1826
01:36:10,801 --> 01:36:12,280
Does anyone have an idea?

1827
01:36:12,369 --> 01:36:13,712
How do we catch this Gabbar?

1828
01:36:14,604 --> 01:36:15,674
Anything?

1829
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:17,775
-Saw ant'? BansaVZ?-

1830
01:36:18,942 --> 01:36:19,943
Sir. may I?

1831
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,624
To catch Gabbar,
we'll have to think like him.

1832
01:36:27,551 --> 01:36:28,291
Sit.

1833
01:36:28,652 --> 01:36:29,630
Yadav, shift.

1834
01:36:31,455 --> 01:36:33,025
I said sit. Sit.

1835
01:36:33,256 --> 01:36:34,257
Yes, sir.

1836
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:38,537
Yadav, order tea for everyone.

1837
01:36:39,463 --> 01:36:40,806
Would you like one? - Yes, sir.

1838
01:36:40,864 --> 01:36:41,842
Him too.

1839
01:36:41,998 --> 01:36:43,602
What were you saying?

1840
01:36:45,268 --> 01:36:45,939
Sir..

1841
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:48,543
...If I was Gabbar..

1842
01:36:49,539 --> 01:36:51,485
...I would've gone
after Digvijay Patil.

1843
01:36:52,242 --> 01:36:52,879
Why?

1844
01:36:53,577 --> 01:36:56,854
Two days ago he killed
an honest officer Sagar Pandit..

1845
01:36:56,913 --> 01:36:58,859
"Because he
refused to take bribe.

1846
01:37:01,218 --> 01:37:02,595
But we don't have any proof.

1847
01:37:02,652 --> 01:37:04,723
But, sir, everyone knows
he's the one who did it.

1848
01:37:04,788 --> 01:37:05,789
Right, sir.

1849
01:37:06,389 --> 01:37:09,370
Digvijay Patil wants to maintain
his fear amongst the people.

1850
01:37:09,426 --> 01:37:12,873
But Gabbar will
definitely punish him.

1851
01:37:24,908 --> 01:37:26,819
We set out to
eradicate bad people..

1852
01:37:27,277 --> 01:37:28,847
...but evil just a bigger leap.

1853
01:37:29,412 --> 01:37:31,756
Sagar was one of the
most honest officers"

1854
01:37:31,815 --> 01:37:32,987
...in his department, sir.

1855
01:37:33,517 --> 01:37:35,895
Patil killed him very cruelly.

1856
01:37:38,722 --> 01:37:42,534
Sir, should we arrest Digvijay
Patil or give him protection?

1857
01:37:45,428 --> 01:37:47,032
There's a thumb rule of hunting.

1858
01:37:48,265 --> 01:37:49,539
Use the goat as bait..

1859
01:37:49,599 --> 01:37:50,839
...as long as the
lion doesn't come out.

1860
01:37:54,704 --> 01:37:56,809
We just need to keep an eye on Patil.

1861
01:37:57,941 --> 01:37:59,511
And Gabbar will
be in our clutches.

1862
01:38:01,878 --> 01:38:03,585
-Patâ€œ has to die.-

1863
01:38:03,747 --> 01:38:04,987
The party's at his farm house"

1864
01:38:05,215 --> 01:38:07,252
...and security is really tight.

1865
01:38:08,218 --> 01:38:10,858
Sir, we have Digvijay
Patil's schedule.

1866
01:38:11,421 --> 01:38:12,627
Tomorrow is his birthday.

1867
01:38:12,689 --> 01:38:14,566
It's not that easy
to catch Patil, sir.

1868
01:38:14,624 --> 01:38:16,729
Most of our team members
are in police custody.

1869
01:38:17,260 --> 01:38:19,262
That place will be crawling
with his men and Police.

1870
01:38:19,329 --> 01:38:22,538
Ministers,
MPs, MLAs, Businessmen"

1871
01:38:22,599 --> 01:38:23,976
...and other famous personalities
will be present there.

1872
01:38:24,401 --> 01:38:26,381
But we'll be waiting
for just one man.

1873
01:38:28,271 --> 01:38:28,976
Gabbar!

1874
01:38:30,807 --> 01:38:31,683
-Boss.-

1875
01:38:33,009 --> 01:38:34,249
We've the whereabouts"

1876
01:38:34,277 --> 01:38:35,517
...of that rascal Aditya
from the hospital.

1877
01:38:36,746 --> 01:38:38,248
I'll bring you his severed head..

1878
01:38:38,281 --> 01:38:40,022
...before you
cut your birthday cake.

1879
01:38:42,986 --> 01:38:46,695
Ballu,
please bring him back alive.

1880
01:38:48,258 --> 01:38:49,760
I will kill him myself.

1881
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:51,398
I will kill him again!

1882
01:38:54,598 --> 01:38:56,339
"Come, sweetheart."

1883
01:38:58,735 --> 01:38:59,713
"Come, sweetheart."

1884
01:38:59,769 --> 01:39:02,511
"I don't know what you want."

1885
01:39:02,839 --> 01:39:03,613
"Come, sweetheart."

1886
01:39:03,673 --> 01:39:06,654
"Why do you make
gestures and call me?"

1887
01:39:06,977 --> 01:39:07,785
"Come, sweetheart."

1888
01:39:07,844 --> 01:39:10,552
"Then why do you refuse
when I come home."

1889
01:39:11,247 --> 01:39:11,816
"Come, sweetheart."

1890
01:39:11,881 --> 01:39:15,727
"Why do you climb
up the roof and sing?"

1891
01:39:16,453 --> 01:39:18,490
"Don't knock on the door,
sweetheart."

1892
01:39:18,555 --> 01:39:20,967
"Just come in, sweetheart."

1893
01:39:24,694 --> 01:39:26,674
"Don't knock on the door,
sweetheart."

1894
01:39:26,730 --> 01:39:28,767
"Just come in, sweetheart."

1895
01:39:28,832 --> 01:39:30,869
"Lay those flowers,
sprinkle that perfume.."

1896
01:39:30,934 --> 01:39:32,914
"..and get in the mood now,
sweetheart."

1897
01:39:32,969 --> 01:39:34,915
"Don't knock on the door,
sweetheart."

1898
01:39:34,971 --> 01:39:37,247
"Just come in, sweetheart."

1899
01:39:40,910 --> 01:39:45,017
"Slowly, sweetheart."

1900
01:39:45,248 --> 01:39:49,390
"Slowly, sweetheart."

1901
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:56,932
"Slowly.."

1902
01:40:14,511 --> 01:40:16,548
"I'm your sweetheart,
be my love."

1903
01:40:16,613 --> 01:40:18,684
"Tonight I am going
to rock your world."

1904
01:40:18,748 --> 01:40:22,821
"I will target the
destination very carefully."

1905
01:40:22,886 --> 01:40:24,832
"I'm going to forsake all shame."

1906
01:40:24,888 --> 01:40:26,890
"And make you my queen."

1907
01:40:26,956 --> 01:40:31,427
"Tonight we're going to have
some fun, baby..under the dim light."

1908
01:40:32,729 --> 01:40:34,731
"Slowly, sweetheart."

1909
01:40:34,798 --> 01:40:38,905
"Slowly, sweetheart."

1910
01:40:38,968 --> 01:40:40,970
"Slowly.."

1911
01:40:41,037 --> 01:40:45,076
"Slowly, sweetheart."

1912
01:40:45,308 --> 01:40:47,754
"Slowly, sweetheart."

1913
01:40:54,617 --> 01:40:56,619
"Don't knock on the door,
sweetheart."

1914
01:40:56,686 --> 01:40:58,723
"Just come in, sweetheart."

1915
01:40:58,788 --> 01:41:00,859
"Lay those flowers,
sprinkle that perfume.."

1916
01:41:00,924 --> 01:41:02,926
"..and get in the mood now,
sweetheart."

1917
01:41:02,992 --> 01:41:04,972
"Don't knock on the door,
sweetheart."

1918
01:41:05,028 --> 01:41:07,269
"Just come in, sweetheart."

1919
01:41:10,834 --> 01:41:15,010
"Slowly, sweetheart."

1920
01:41:15,271 --> 01:41:20,619
"Slowly, sweetheart."

1921
01:41:20,677 --> 01:41:22,486
"Slowly, sweetheart."

1922
01:41:22,545 --> 01:41:26,789
"Slowly.."

1923
01:41:49,806 --> 01:41:51,649
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

1924
01:41:51,674 --> 01:41:53,517
...Patil sir will be remembered.

1925
01:41:53,576 --> 01:41:55,419
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

1926
01:41:55,478 --> 01:41:57,253
...Patil sir will be remembered.

1927
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,918
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

1928
01:41:58,982 --> 01:42:00,757
...Patil sir will be remembered.

1929
01:42:00,817 --> 01:42:02,592
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

1930
01:42:02,652 --> 01:42:04,427
...Patil sir will be remembered.

1931
01:42:04,487 --> 01:42:06,262
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

1932
01:42:06,289 --> 01:42:07,859
...Patil sir will be remembered.

1933
01:42:07,924 --> 01:42:09,597
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

1934
01:42:09,659 --> 01:42:11,400
...Patil sir will be remembered.

1935
01:42:11,461 --> 01:42:13,270
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

1936
01:42:13,296 --> 01:42:15,003
...Patil sir will be remembered.

1937
01:42:15,265 --> 01:42:16,835
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

1938
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:18,573
...Patil sir will be remembered.

1939
01:42:18,635 --> 01:42:20,376
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

1940
01:42:20,436 --> 01:42:21,972
...Patil sir will be remembered.

1941
01:42:31,915 --> 01:42:32,450
There he is.

1942
01:42:32,515 --> 01:42:33,789
Catch him.

1943
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:35,329
I am coming down.

1944
01:42:35,618 --> 01:42:37,427
Okay, sir. Copy. Copy.

1945
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:52,743
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

1946
01:42:52,802 --> 01:42:54,873
...Patil you won't be remembered.

1947
01:43:32,876 --> 01:43:34,321
Check posts have been
setup for many hours"

1948
01:43:34,410 --> 01:43:36,981
...but there's still no news.

1949
01:43:37,046 --> 01:43:39,583
What could be the reason
behind Digvijay Patil's kidnapping?

1950
01:43:39,649 --> 01:43:40,684
You can clearly see here..

1951
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:42,286
...how the entire police
force is trying hard..

1952
01:43:42,318 --> 01:43:43,661
...to catch Digvijay Patil.

1953
01:43:49,592 --> 01:43:50,593
Shame on us.

1954
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:52,503
He kidnapped
right before our eyes.

1955
01:43:52,862 --> 01:43:53,806
Sawant. - Sir.

1956
01:43:53,863 --> 01:43:55,706
Someone must know his hideout.

1957
01:43:56,266 --> 01:43:56,903
Find out. - Yes sir.

1958
01:43:56,966 --> 01:43:58,001
Sir. - What?

1959
01:43:59,869 --> 01:44:00,609
What?

1960
01:44:00,937 --> 01:44:03,884
I am the council representing the
arrested Government officer. - So.

1961
01:44:03,940 --> 01:44:06,284
We have permission
to meet our client.

1962
01:44:06,843 --> 01:44:08,823
And their relatives
are with us too.

1963
01:44:09,879 --> 01:44:11,449
Sir, I've checked all the papers.

1964
01:44:11,514 --> 01:44:12,788
Can we go see them now?

1965
01:44:15,618 --> 01:44:16,494
Where is my son?

1966
01:44:16,552 --> 01:44:17,530
Deepa k.

1967
01:44:18,388 --> 01:44:19,423
Deepa k.

1968
01:44:19,489 --> 01:44:20,968
Deepa k.

1969
01:44:23,426 --> 01:44:24,496
Oh, God!

1970
01:44:24,661 --> 01:44:26,766
They beat him up so brutally.

1971
01:44:27,697 --> 01:44:28,835
Well done, sir.

1972
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:33,911
You've done a great job by
arresting these innocent people.

1973
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:35,476
What?

1974
01:44:35,538 --> 01:44:36,573
Innocent?

1975
01:44:37,307 --> 01:44:39,309
Innocent? My foot.

1976
01:44:40,276 --> 01:44:41,812
All of them are serial offenders.

1977
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:45,284
They've committed murders
along with Gabbar.

1978
01:44:45,315 --> 01:44:46,385
All of them.

1979
01:44:47,650 --> 01:44:48,890
Innocent.

1980
01:44:49,886 --> 01:44:52,423
And I know..Gabbar
has kept Digvijay Patil..

1981
01:44:52,488 --> 01:44:53,762
...and he's going to kill him.

1982
01:44:55,558 --> 01:44:56,593
Criminals.

1983
01:44:57,527 --> 01:44:58,267
Govind.

1984
01:44:59,996 --> 01:45:03,569
Sir..AC P C handrakanfs wife.

1985
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:11,985
Mother.

1986
01:45:19,449 --> 01:45:21,258
Gabbar killed your husband, ma'am.

1987
01:45:21,918 --> 01:45:23,363
He killed your husband.

1988
01:45:23,419 --> 01:45:24,295
His father.

1989
01:45:25,021 --> 01:45:27,501
Tell him to tell us
where he could be hiding.

1990
01:45:27,690 --> 01:45:29,033
Where are his hideouts?

1991
01:45:30,259 --> 01:45:31,033
You will be responsible"

1992
01:45:31,294 --> 01:45:34,764
...for your husband
and his father's death.

1993
01:45:35,798 --> 01:45:40,645
Govind,
if you tell them anything"

1994
01:45:41,871 --> 01:45:44,715
...then consider
your mother's dead!

1995
01:45:44,774 --> 01:45:45,809
Ma'am.

1996
01:45:47,010 --> 01:45:51,425
You're a Policeman's
wife supporting a criminal.

1997
01:46:03,726 --> 01:46:05,262
I don't get this.

1998
01:46:05,795 --> 01:46:06,569
Why?

1999
01:46:06,796 --> 01:46:08,537
Who is this Gabbar?

2000
01:46:10,433 --> 01:46:12,640
Why is a criminal getting
so much affection?

2001
01:46:13,236 --> 01:46:15,614
Because the Law isn't
doing its job properly.

2002
01:46:16,372 --> 01:46:17,248
Sorry!

2003
01:46:18,408 --> 01:46:21,651
The Police needs to arrest
the corrupt government officials"

2004
01:46:21,711 --> 01:46:23,918
...and then the court
needs to punish them.

2005
01:46:23,980 --> 01:46:25,653
If the Law is helpless"

2006
01:46:25,715 --> 01:46:27,592
...then somebody
has to do something!

2007
01:46:29,552 --> 01:46:31,657
So you think Gabbar
is legally correct.

2008
01:46:31,721 --> 01:46:33,723
Sir, the society doesn't suffer"

2009
01:46:33,790 --> 01:46:35,292
"because of the
criminals wrong-doings.

2010
01:46:35,391 --> 01:46:39,271
A society suffers when
a capable man does nothing.

2011
01:46:39,529 --> 01:46:40,974
Gabbar is a good man.

2012
01:46:41,697 --> 01:46:43,973
Gabbar is capable of
doing something for us.

2013
01:46:45,468 --> 01:46:46,708
You know him, don't you?

2014
01:46:47,737 --> 01:46:48,909
You know who he is.

2015
01:46:49,639 --> 01:46:50,982
I know the reason"

2016
01:46:51,474 --> 01:46:53,954
...which turned a
common man into Gabbar.

2017
01:46:56,846 --> 01:46:58,257
When you light a torch..

2018
01:46:58,314 --> 01:47:00,920
...where's the one place
that still stays dark?

2019
01:47:01,684 --> 01:47:02,856
-Where, Patâ€œ?-

2020
01:47:05,555 --> 01:47:07,398
Stupid, right under the torch.

2021
01:47:08,257 --> 01:47:09,668
The police is
running helter-skelter"

2022
01:47:09,725 --> 01:47:11,568
...but no one's
looking in your home.

2023
01:47:12,795 --> 01:47:14,638
You want revenge from me?

2024
01:47:15,665 --> 01:47:17,474
I am Digvijay Patil.

2025
01:47:17,934 --> 01:47:19,277
I am a brand.

2026
01:47:19,368 --> 01:47:21,644
What's this about brand
you keep ranting about!

2027
01:47:21,904 --> 01:47:23,645
Take a good look at me.

2028
01:47:23,906 --> 01:47:28,355
Digvijay Patil,
lam a bigger brand than you.

2029
01:47:28,711 --> 01:47:29,815
You?

2030
01:47:30,279 --> 01:47:31,519
Yes, me.

2031
01:47:32,014 --> 01:47:33,960
Even 50 miles away..

2032
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:35,620
...when someone takes
a bribe people say..

2033
01:47:35,685 --> 01:47:37,289
"Don't take it, or..

2034
01:47:37,987 --> 01:47:39,830
...Gabbar will show up."

2035
01:47:41,457 --> 01:47:42,731
You are Gabbar?

2036
01:47:43,493 --> 01:47:44,767
Yes.

2037
01:47:45,695 --> 01:47:47,299
Gabbar!

2038
01:47:52,368 --> 01:47:56,748
Five years ago you
gave me two chances.

2039
01:47:57,907 --> 01:48:01,514
Today I'll give you three.

2040
01:48:02,812 --> 01:48:04,519
You can call anyone you want.

2041
01:48:05,748 --> 01:48:08,888
And tell them who you are.

2042
01:48:09,385 --> 01:48:14,733
You will know who's
a bigger brand, you or me.

2043
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:15,928
Make the call.

2044
01:48:25,568 --> 01:48:26,808
Hello. - Hello.

2045
01:48:27,370 --> 01:48:29,008
Waghmare. - Speaking.

2046
01:48:29,438 --> 01:48:30,849
-This is Digviï¬‚ay Patâ€œ.-

2047
01:48:31,507 --> 01:48:33,282
lam in trouble, Waghmare.

2048
01:48:34,277 --> 01:48:35,688
Gabbar has kidnapped me.

2049
01:48:35,745 --> 01:48:37,782
Why are you dragging
me in this mess?

2050
01:48:37,847 --> 01:48:40,987
If Gabbar finds out,
I'll be punished.

2051
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:42,351
Hang UP-

2052
01:48:42,418 --> 01:48:43,726
I made you Home Minister.

2053
01:48:43,786 --> 01:48:45,288
I'll pay you any price you want.

2054
01:48:45,354 --> 01:48:46,424
My life is in danger.

2055
01:48:46,489 --> 01:48:47,593
Hello! Hello!

2056
01:48:52,728 --> 01:48:54,435
Second chance.

2057
01:49:02,872 --> 01:49:03,441
Hello.

2058
01:49:03,506 --> 01:49:04,484
Commissioner's office.

2059
01:49:04,674 --> 01:49:06,210
-This is Digviï¬‚ay Patâ€œ.-

2060
01:49:06,342 --> 01:49:08,253
Gabbar is holding me captive.

2061
01:49:08,678 --> 01:49:09,850
Is this the Police Station?

2062
01:49:10,246 --> 01:49:10,986
No.

2063
01:49:11,347 --> 01:49:12,451
This is the Police Station.

2064
01:49:12,515 --> 01:49:13,585
That's what I am saying.

2065
01:49:13,649 --> 01:49:14,593
This is the Police Station, right?

2066
01:49:14,650 --> 01:49:15,390
That's what I am saying.

2067
01:49:15,451 --> 01:49:17,362
This is the Police Station,
not the Pizza Station.

2068
01:49:17,787 --> 01:49:19,391
Sadhu, what's wrong?

2069
01:49:19,789 --> 01:49:21,268
It's some crazy guy, sir.

2070
01:49:21,324 --> 01:49:22,997
He's called up the Police
Station and ordering for pizza.

2071
01:49:24,794 --> 01:49:27,365
For the last time..this
is the Police Station.

2072
01:49:28,764 --> 01:49:29,572
Hello!

2073
01:49:29,832 --> 01:49:30,674
Hello!

2074
01:49:32,969 --> 01:49:36,416
Gabbar is a bigger brand than you.

2075
01:49:37,373 --> 01:49:40,513
These cowards didn't
make me Digvijay Patil.

2076
01:49:40,810 --> 01:49:43,984
Digvijay Patil isn't human,
he's a brand!

2077
01:51:33,723 --> 01:51:34,599
Sorry.

2078
01:51:35,791 --> 01:51:36,826
Sorry.

2079
01:51:42,565 --> 01:51:43,839
I am sorry.

2080
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:06,422
I hate sorry's

2081
01:52:19,769 --> 01:52:20,804
Excuse me.

2082
01:52:20,970 --> 01:52:21,778
What?

2083
01:52:21,837 --> 01:52:24,317
Where's your CBI officer's cabin?

2084
01:52:24,373 --> 01:52:26,319
Why? - I want to meet him.

2085
01:52:26,375 --> 01:52:27,820
Kuldeep sir doesn't meet everyone.

2086
01:52:27,877 --> 01:52:29,288
What did you want from him?

2087
01:52:29,412 --> 01:52:31,323
I wanted to talk
to him about Gabbar.

2088
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:32,654
Again Gabbar.

2089
01:52:33,482 --> 01:52:34,324
What do I say?

2090
01:52:34,517 --> 01:52:36,656
The Prime Minister's
here asking about Gabbar!

2091
01:52:38,621 --> 01:52:41,431
Tell him..Gabbar's
here to talk to him.

2092
01:52:46,695 --> 01:52:47,867
Sadhu. - What?

2093
01:52:47,930 --> 01:52:48,704
Gabbar.

2094
01:52:48,764 --> 01:52:49,435
Gabbar what?

2095
01:52:49,498 --> 01:52:50,408
Gabbar's here.

2096
01:53:25,734 --> 01:53:26,974
Kuldeep Pawa.

2097
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:29,882
Professor Aditya,
from National College.

2098
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:31,984
Gabbar!

2099
01:53:36,679 --> 01:53:37,919
Gabbar.

2100
01:53:38,848 --> 01:53:40,828
I am here to surrender, sir.

2101
01:53:42,318 --> 01:53:45,856
I killed one Collector in Latur,
one in Nashik..

2102
01:53:46,322 --> 01:53:49,735
...a Police officer in Mumbai
and many other corrupt officers.

2103
01:53:49,792 --> 01:53:52,671
And now..l just murdered
a well-known businessman.

2104
01:53:53,262 --> 01:53:56,732
Digvijay Patil.
I'm sure you've heard of him.

2105
01:53:58,267 --> 01:54:00,338
I take full responsibility
for all these murders.

2106
01:54:01,604 --> 01:54:05,017
I planned all the murders.

2107
01:54:05,341 --> 01:54:06,979
And I did it in complete sense.

2108
01:54:07,576 --> 01:54:08,953
This is my fight.

2109
01:54:09,645 --> 01:54:12,251
I request you to release..

2110
01:54:12,381 --> 01:54:16,796
...all the honest officers
and students you have arrested.

2111
01:54:23,859 --> 01:54:24,860
Noone knows him.

2112
01:54:26,962 --> 01:54:28,305
I saw him myself.

2113
01:54:30,266 --> 01:54:32,473
What is his plan? Who is this Gabbar?

2114
01:54:32,701 --> 01:54:34,578
Millions of people
have sent their petitions"

2115
01:54:34,637 --> 01:54:36,639
...to the President asking
for the release of Gabbar.

2116
01:54:36,705 --> 01:54:37,683
What do you say about that, sir?

2117
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:39,014
"This country
will never change."

2118
01:54:39,275 --> 01:54:40,413
How many times
have we said this?

2119
01:54:40,476 --> 01:54:42,956
But now there is one person
who is trying to bring some change.

2120
01:54:43,012 --> 01:54:44,582
I urge everyone
to come on the road..

2121
01:54:44,647 --> 01:54:45,751
You can clearly see"

2122
01:54:45,814 --> 01:54:47,316
...there are medical students,
art students..

2123
01:54:47,383 --> 01:54:49,329
...and students from all
colleges are present here.

2124
01:54:49,418 --> 01:54:52,262
You can see how they've
come on the road for Gabbar.

2125
01:54:52,521 --> 01:54:53,829
"Free Gabbar. Free Gabbar."

2126
01:54:53,889 --> 01:54:55,766
That's the slogan people
are shouting here too.

2127
01:54:58,794 --> 01:55:01,934
The fear of Gabbar brought
some change to this picture.

2128
01:55:03,632 --> 01:55:04,838
There's a rumor amongst people..

2129
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:06,345
...that Gabbar may be hanged.

2130
01:55:06,402 --> 01:55:06,777
So the people..

2131
01:55:06,835 --> 01:55:09,509
Gabbar is the phenomena
which has taken over India.

2132
01:55:09,572 --> 01:55:12,280
People are on the roads
to lend their support to Gabbar.

2133
01:55:12,374 --> 01:55:13,876
Rallies protesting
to free Gabbar..

2134
01:55:13,943 --> 01:55:15,854
...are being held
all over the country.

2135
01:55:15,911 --> 01:55:17,754
Gabbar will be taken
to court by this route.

2136
01:55:17,813 --> 01:55:19,292
As you can see people
are protesting here?

2137
01:55:19,348 --> 01:55:21,259
No one wants Gabbar to be punished.

2138
01:55:21,283 --> 01:55:23,024
Let's see what the
judgment is going to be.

2139
01:55:23,285 --> 01:55:25,458
As you can see,
everyone's shouting slogans"

2140
01:55:25,521 --> 01:55:27,626
...of "Free Gabbar, Release Gabbar".

2141
01:55:40,636 --> 01:55:45,278
Set Gabbar free!

2142
01:55:45,307 --> 01:55:49,483
Set Gabbar free!

2143
01:55:52,247 --> 01:55:52,952
The uniform's stopping me..

2144
01:55:53,215 --> 01:55:54,694
...I would be shouting
slogans for you too.

2145
01:55:58,721 --> 01:56:02,863
Gabbar. Gabbar.

2146
01:56:02,925 --> 01:56:04,427
It's getting out of control.

2147
01:56:05,694 --> 01:56:07,264
This way we'll never make it.

2148
01:56:08,230 --> 01:56:09,937
They will only
listen to you, Aditya.

2149
01:56:12,534 --> 01:56:13,842
Can you help me out here?

2150
01:56:16,839 --> 01:56:21,481
Set Gabbar free!

2151
01:56:33,622 --> 01:56:37,627
Gabbar. Gabbar.

2152
01:56:37,693 --> 01:56:41,573
Gabbar. Gabbar.

2153
01:56:48,370 --> 01:56:49,508
Shall we take attendance?

2154
01:56:49,571 --> 01:56:50,549
Yes sir.

2155
01:56:50,606 --> 01:56:52,210
They cannot harm you, sir.

2156
01:56:52,241 --> 01:56:53,618
We'll go to the President, sir.

2157
01:56:53,676 --> 01:56:55,519
He will have to pardon you.

2158
01:56:55,878 --> 01:56:58,518
I never pardoned
any wrong guy.

2159
01:56:59,715 --> 01:57:01,626
So how can
I ask pardon for myself?

2160
01:57:01,684 --> 01:57:02,856
You're not the criminal, sir.

2161
01:57:02,918 --> 01:57:04,420
What you did was right.

2162
01:57:04,486 --> 01:57:05,521
If anything happens to you..

2163
01:57:05,587 --> 01:57:07,260
...we will destroy this city.

2164
01:57:07,356 --> 01:57:09,233
We'll show them
student power, sir.

2165
01:57:09,258 --> 01:57:10,362
Student power!

2166
01:57:10,426 --> 01:57:12,838
Student power!

2167
01:57:12,895 --> 01:57:14,568
Student power!

2168
01:57:14,630 --> 01:57:15,472
Yes.

2169
01:57:16,565 --> 01:57:17,771
Student power.

2170
01:57:20,235 --> 01:57:21,976
I am proud of student power.

2171
01:57:22,638 --> 01:57:27,018
You know, not every student
becomes a government officer.

2172
01:57:27,276 --> 01:57:31,349
But every government
officer is a student.

2173
01:57:32,281 --> 01:57:34,784
Look..stop trying
to know your future..

2174
01:57:34,850 --> 01:57:36,796
...and start shaking
up the corrupt people..

2175
01:57:36,852 --> 01:57:38,297
...and say "Enough".

2176
01:57:38,353 --> 01:57:39,957
You just shrug your
shoulders everywhere.

2177
01:57:40,022 --> 01:57:42,298
"So what? What do we care?"

2178
01:57:42,791 --> 01:57:44,293
Raise your hands.

2179
01:57:44,359 --> 01:57:46,896
Shivaji Maharaj didn't
start any Whatsapp group.

2180
01:57:46,962 --> 01:57:49,704
He set out alone,
and everyone joined him.

2181
01:57:50,966 --> 01:57:52,468
You need to decide..

2182
01:57:52,634 --> 01:57:55,740
...which direction you
want to take your country.

2183
01:57:55,971 --> 01:57:58,247
Because you
are the future of India.

2184
01:57:59,341 --> 01:58:01,446
You! The youth power!

2185
01:58:01,744 --> 01:58:02,916
Be the change!

2186
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:06,585
I started
killing these people..

2187
01:58:07,216 --> 01:58:08,889
...after I wrote my own death.

2188
01:58:09,952 --> 01:58:11,431
After I'm dead..

2189
01:58:11,787 --> 01:58:16,600
...don't burn down cars,
trains or taxis.

2190
01:58:17,426 --> 01:58:18,734
If you really
want to do something"

2191
01:58:19,228 --> 01:58:21,367
...then light
a fire in your heart.

2192
01:58:22,731 --> 01:58:24,369
Gabbar will be happy.

2193
01:58:24,733 --> 01:58:26,269
He'll be proud of you.

2194
01:58:30,005 --> 01:58:32,246
Do you know
why I killed those people?

2195
01:58:32,741 --> 01:58:34,652
Why I killed
those corrupt people?

2196
01:58:35,377 --> 01:58:36,754
Can anyone tell me?

2197
01:58:37,246 --> 01:58:38,281
I will tell you.

2198
01:58:39,548 --> 01:58:41,585
Kill one corrupt guy..

2199
01:58:43,285 --> 01:58:47,028
...and it'll be an eye-opener
for all the other corrupt people.

2200
01:58:49,291 --> 01:58:51,635
And do you
know why I have to die?

2201
01:58:52,561 --> 01:58:54,370
Because Gabbar was wrong.

2202
01:58:55,564 --> 01:58:58,807
What I did was right.

2203
01:58:59,568 --> 01:59:02,811
But the
path I chose was wrong.

2204
01:59:03,238 --> 01:59:05,218
Because
I didn't have a choice.

2205
01:59:05,541 --> 01:59:06,611
I had to do it.

2206
01:59:09,645 --> 01:59:11,522
Do you know who Gabbar is?

2207
01:59:11,580 --> 01:59:15,858
Every man who doesn't
turn his back to injustice"

2208
01:59:16,251 --> 01:59:17,252
"that's Gabbar.

2209
01:59:17,686 --> 01:59:20,257
Someone who
beats up the corrupt..

2210
01:59:20,355 --> 01:59:21,356
"That's Gabbar.

2211
01:59:22,591 --> 01:59:26,368
Someone who makes corrupt
government officials"

2212
01:59:26,428 --> 01:59:27,634
"sweat
even in their AC cabins.

2213
01:59:27,696 --> 01:59:28,674
That's Gabbar.

2214
01:59:28,730 --> 01:59:29,902
If I had been
from National College"

2215
01:59:29,965 --> 01:59:31,376
...I would've been with you too.

2216
01:59:31,433 --> 01:59:33,413
Sadhuram,
you can still do great things"

2217
01:59:33,569 --> 01:59:36,015
...from where you are.

2218
01:59:37,539 --> 01:59:38,984
Which one of you is Gabbar?

2219
01:59:39,241 --> 01:59:40,413
I'm the gabbar.

2220
01:59:40,475 --> 01:59:41,351
Who is Gabbar?

2221
01:59:41,410 --> 01:59:42,411
I'm the gabbar.

2222
01:59:42,477 --> 01:59:43,421
Who is Gabbar?

2223
01:59:43,478 --> 01:59:44,855
I'm the gabbar.

2224
01:59:46,915 --> 01:59:48,553
Want to know a Google fact?

2225
01:59:48,784 --> 01:59:50,821
One kiss burns many calories.

2226
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:54,626
Want to lose some
weight..before I die.

2227
02:00:00,262 --> 02:00:01,036
No..

2228
02:00:05,834 --> 02:00:08,371
If anyone tries to take bribe again"

2229
02:00:08,437 --> 02:00:10,713
...a voice
will echo in his heart.

2230
02:00:10,772 --> 02:00:12,683
Don't take bribe, or else..

2231
02:00:12,741 --> 02:00:14,049
Gabbar will show up!

2232
02:00:14,309 --> 02:00:16,311
Or else? - Gabbar will show up!

2233
02:00:16,411 --> 02:00:18,721
Or else? - Gabbar will show up!

2234
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:19,918
Gabbar will show up!

2235
02:00:38,767 --> 02:00:40,678
I will be dead.

2236
02:00:41,303 --> 02:00:42,941
What about you, Kaalia?

2237
02:00:50,012 --> 02:00:51,923
"Do whatever you want."

2238
02:00:53,548 --> 02:00:55,550
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

2239
02:00:57,019 --> 02:00:58,794
"Do whatever you want."

2240
02:00:58,854 --> 02:01:00,629
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

2241
02:01:00,689 --> 02:01:02,430
"Be a little scared, son."

2242
02:01:02,491 --> 02:01:04,266
"Or Gabbar will show up."

2243
02:01:04,293 --> 02:01:05,795
"Do whatever you want."

2244
02:01:05,861 --> 02:01:07,670
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

2245
02:01:07,729 --> 02:01:09,504
"Be a little scared, son."

2246
02:01:09,564 --> 02:01:11,305
"Or Gabbar will show up."

2247
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:12,902
"Do whatever you want."

2248
02:01:12,968 --> 02:01:14,777
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

2249
02:01:14,836 --> 02:01:16,611
"Be a little scared, son."

2250
02:01:16,672 --> 02:01:18,379
"Or Gabbar will show up."

2251
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:20,010
"Do whatever you want."

2252
02:01:20,275 --> 02:01:21,845
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

02:01:21,910 --> 02:01:23,981
"Be a little scared, son."

2254
02:01:24,413 --> 02:01:27,326
What about you, Kaalia?

2255
02:01:28,283 --> 02:01:29,762
"Do whatever you want."

2256
02:01:29,818 --> 02:01:31,661
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

2257
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:33,461
"Be a little scared, son."

2258
02:01:33,522 --> 02:01:35,331
"Or Gabbar will show up."

2259
02:01:35,390 --> 02:01:36,926
"Do whatever you want."

2260
02:01:36,992 --> 02:01:38,699
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

2261
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:40,535
"Be a little scared, son."

2262
02:01:40,595 --> 02:01:42,700
"Or Gabbar will show up."

2263
02:01:42,764 --> 02:01:44,437
"Gabbar."

2264
02:01:44,566 --> 02:01:45,840
"Gabbar."

2265
02:01:46,335 --> 02:01:47,609
"Gabbar."

2266
02:01:47,669 --> 02:01:49,444
"Or Gabbar will show up."

2267
02:01:49,504 --> 02:01:51,006
"Gabbar."

2268
02:01:51,573 --> 02:01:52,881
"Gabbar."

2269
02:01:53,375 --> 02:01:54,649
"Gabbar."

2270
02:01:55,243 --> 02:01:56,654
"Gabbar will be happy."

2271
02:01:56,712 --> 02:01:58,623
"This is not a comic or a game."

2272
02:01:58,680 --> 02:02:00,387
"He's not the Spider or Superman."

2273
02:02:00,449 --> 02:02:02,292
"He roams the streets
at night for your safety."

2274
02:02:02,351 --> 02:02:03,955
"Gabbar is the better man."

2275
02:02:04,019 --> 02:02:05,726
"Gabbar is a brave-heart."

2276
02:02:05,787 --> 02:02:06,629
"When the lion walks in the jungle.."

2277
02:02:06,688 --> 02:02:07,564
"..the scavengers
make themselves scarce."

2278
02:02:07,622 --> 02:02:08,999
"This lion hunts only those.."

2279
02:02:09,257 --> 02:02:11,533
"..who make money the wrong way."

2280
02:02:14,763 --> 02:02:16,674
Even 50 miles away..

2281
02:02:16,765 --> 02:02:18,438
...when someone takes a bribe..

2282
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:19,535
---- People say..

2283
02:02:19,601 --> 02:02:20,739
"Don't take it, or..

2284
02:02:20,802 --> 02:02:21,712
...Gabbar will show up."

2285
02:02:21,770 --> 02:02:23,477
"Evil only begets evil."

2286
02:02:23,538 --> 02:02:25,313
"There's still time
so straighten up now."

2287
02:02:25,374 --> 02:02:26,546
"And if you don't.."

2288
02:02:26,608 --> 02:02:28,952
"..you'll get a one
way ticket to hell."

2289
02:02:29,011 --> 02:02:30,547
"Don't make this mistake."

2290
02:02:30,612 --> 02:02:32,387
"Save your head."

2291
02:02:32,447 --> 02:02:34,290
"if you want to sleep
at nights, then.."

2292
02:02:34,316 --> 02:02:35,852
"..be afraid of Gabbar."

2293
02:02:36,284 --> 02:02:37,991
"Do whatever you want."

2294
02:02:38,053 --> 02:02:39,828
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

2295
02:02:39,888 --> 02:02:41,629
"Be a little scared, son."

2296
02:02:41,690 --> 02:02:43,465
"Or Gabbar will show up."

2297
02:02:43,525 --> 02:02:45,300
"Do whatever you want."

2298
02:02:45,327 --> 02:02:46,931
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

2299
02:02:46,995 --> 02:02:48,770
"Be a little scared, son."

2300
02:02:48,830 --> 02:02:50,673
"Or Gabbar will show up."

2301
02:02:50,832 --> 02:02:52,277
"Gabbar."

2302
02:02:52,701 --> 02:02:53,975
"Gabbar."

2303
02:02:54,503 --> 02:02:55,777
"Gabbar."

2304
02:02:56,271 --> 02:02:57,978
"Why should bravo?"

2305
02:02:58,240 --> 02:02:59,378
"Gabbar."

2306
02:02:59,441 --> 02:03:00,920
"Gabbar."

2307
02:03:01,576 --> 02:03:02,816
"Gabbar."

2308
02:03:04,479 --> 02:03:06,459
