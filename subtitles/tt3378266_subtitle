<i>'Madurai'</i>

2
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,960
<i>'He considers himself to be a genius.'</i>

3
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,120
<i>'With the intelligence I have, I should have been in America.'</i>

4
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,760
<i>'He thinks himself to be smart..'</i>

5
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,000
<i>What does he think of himself?</i>

6
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,720
<i>Here, we are sitting with our heart in our mouth</i>

7
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,440
<i>and there, he's busy flirting with that girl.</i>

8
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,240
<i>Should love be his priority now?</i>

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,480
<i>You're the one spoiling him.</i>

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,720
<i>If anything happens to him</i>

11
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,440
<i>you will be dead.</i>

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,640
<i>Which area? - Tallakulam.</i>

13
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,400
<i>Start the car.</i>

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,800
<i>Sit down.</i>

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,760
<i>You go ahead, I'll pick up the mutton pancake I'd ordered for.</i>

16
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,360
<i>We don't want anything. Just hop on! - Hey!</i>

17
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,760
<i>Don't raise your voice at me and stop treating me like a kid.</i>

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,120
<i>You are controlling me all the time!</i>

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,520
<i>Let me see who attacks me!</i>

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,760
<i>Let it be. - Hey! Take your hands off!</i>

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,960
<i>Leave him.</i>

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,080
<i>He's a big shot now!</i>

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,640
<i>He can take care of himself. Come and sit.</i>

24
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,080
<i>Hey, how.. - I said, sit!</i>

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,440
<i>Go with him.</i>

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,440
<i>Why do you keep fighting? - Do you have any liquor?</i>

27
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,880
<i>I'll deal with you later.</i>

28
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,440
'Bone of Contention'

29
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,840
<i>That guy is dragging the bike.</i>

30
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,000
<i>Forget the bike. Let us escape.</i>

31
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,640
<i>Come soon.</i>

32
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,440
<i>Be in hiding for two days. Don't get caught by the police.</i>

33
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,840
<i>Okay, boss. - Go in four different directions.</i>

34
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,520
<i>None of us should get caught.</i>

35
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,280
<i>Okay, boss. - Run, run. - Come back only when I tell you.</i>

36
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,640
<i>Lift him.</i>

37
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,560
<i>Hey! Hey! Give a hand.</i>

38
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,480
<i>Lift him up. Hurry up.</i>

39
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,160
<i>Start the auto.</i>

40
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,760
<i>Make him lie down on the seat.</i>

41
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
Come here. - Aarumugam..

42
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,840
What happened?

43
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,440
<i>Carry him. - Carry him. - Carry him.</i>

44
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,160
<i>Get him inside the auto. - Hey! Hey, careful.</i>

45
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,080
<i>Tie a cloth to stop the bleeding. - Oh, no! - Pazhani!</i>

46
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,520
<i>Carry him.</i>

47
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,880
<i>They have killed this innocent man.</i>

48
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,400
<i>How will I face his family?</i>

49
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,360
'Few days back.'

50
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,320
Goddess Meenakshi!

51
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,800
With your grace, we've succeeded in whatever we've laid our hands on.

52
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,360
This time too, we should reap golden rewards with Your blessings!

53
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,800
Who are you? Where are you from?

54
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,600
You seem to have brought something?

55
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
We're from 'Vijay and co.', ma'am.

56
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,520
They had ordered for a cupboard, but the house is locked.

57
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,840
They've gone to school. I have the key.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,200
I'll give it to you.

59
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,560
Watch your step. Move it carefully.

60
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,560
Careful.

61
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,760
Watch the floor. Slowly.

62
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,000
Carefully.

63
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,000
Careful, ma'am. We'll take leave, ma'am.

64
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,640
Bye. - Bye.

65
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,680
My back bone is knotted!

66
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,880
'He considers himself to be a genius.'

67
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,920
Hello. - Finished the job?

68
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,040
Couldn't you get a taller cupboard? My back is aching.

69
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,840
This is all we could get for the time being.

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,640
We'll have to cut a palm tree to make one, to accommodate you in!

71
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,640
Hang up now, I'll call when I'm done.

72
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,200
Lefty lout!

73
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,080
Why worry when You are there to protect me?

74
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,040
God, protect me from all risks.

75
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,080
Heights of intelligence!

76
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,960
They think, they've hidden the keys in the cleverest cubbyhole!

77
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,440
'Wow! What a haul!'

78
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,640
Ask him the status.

79
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,920
Speak. - Dude, he's loaded.

80
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,680
I think, he is a loan-shark.

81
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,320
He has loads of money.

82
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,200
It's all 1000 rupee bundles.

83
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,320
I'm done, come soon.

84
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,720
We'll be there right away. He's done with his job.

85
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,200
Ma'am, we delivered at the wrong address.

86
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,040
The cupboard should be delivered at Suraiyur.

87
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,760
But we delivered it at Subramaniapuram.

88
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,400
You men are being such a nuisance!

89
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,920
Please help us.

90
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,360
Okay, come with me.

91
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,000
At least, now, deliver it to the right owner.

92
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,160
Okay, ma'am.

93
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,280
'Thefts of this kind are becoming common in Madurai.'

94
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,080
'The police have given an assurance to nab this gang at the earliest.'

95
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,960
'People of Madurai are now living in constant fear of theft.'

96
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,240
'Along with cameraman, Senthil this is Udayarani for Kalaignar news.'

97
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,920
Both of us worked so hard to save all that money!

98
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,400
Some thief came and stole everything!

99
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,120
What do we do now?

100
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,760
We've lost everything!

101
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Sir.

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,960
Sir..

103
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,080
You are applying powder and checking. If the thief had worn gloves

104
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,560
how can you get his fingerprints?

105
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,640
You!

106
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,000
Looks like you are on the thief's side!

107
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,120
It seems as if they had invited the thief to their house.

108
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Instead of breaking into the house

109
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,760
the thieves seem to have been handed the keys on a platter!

110
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,520
Who is to blame? These people.

111
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,960
Who is the lady of the house? - This lady.

112
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,760
Where do you work?

113
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,480
I'm a teacher in Paalvadi.

114
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,640
Who else are there at home?

115
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,520
The kids get back from school.

116
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,000
So, we give the keys to this lady who is our neighbor.

117
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,360
Bring this old lady to the police station for interrogation.

118
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,440
'Cupboard-pulling thieves are rampant in Madurai now.'

119
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,000
'Police are on the hunt.' - Dude!

120
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
Looks like even if the showroom delivers their cupboards hereafter

121
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,200
people will panic! - Yes. Absolutely.

122
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,680
Thieves have multiplied in every nook and corner.

123
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,200
You be careful.

124
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,680
No one will ever order for a cupboard!

125
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,600
Read out what is this week's prediction for Leo sun sign.

126
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,640
There he goes again!

127
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,720
People born under Leo sun sign..

128
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,280
Your future is bright.

129
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,560
Good events are round the corner. Good news will come your way.

130
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,040
Not good news.

131
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,280
It's bad news! - What?

132
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,920
What do you mean? - Take a look.

133
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,560
Dude, escape! - Run, run for your life.

134
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Ice candy! Ice candy!

135
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,720
Oh, God!

136
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,080
Oh, God!

137
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,760
Hello! Hello!

138
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,420
Someone, lend me a hand!

139
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,840
A girl is lying injured here after meeting with an accident!

140
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,120
Save this girl. Come soon!

141
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,240
Come soon. Come on.

142
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,840
I asked you to track the thief with our sniffer dog.

143
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,520
Instead, you've admitted a girl at the hospital!

144
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,480
1000 thieves can escape but an accident victim should be saved.

145
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,840
You and your word play! Who will answer our boss? Go!

146
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,080
My chain has got stolen, sir.

147
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,920
Chain snatch incident? Which area?

148
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,320
Don't make me blush, sir.

149
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,360
You idiot!

150
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,040
From which area did your chain get stolen?

151
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,120
Sokkikulam.

152
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,120
Is it Sokkikulam? Okay, I'll enquire. Go!

153
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,840
Your moustache looks very nice, sir!

154
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,880
Get lost!

155
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,520
'Get started.'

156
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,000
They are the cupboard-pulling thieves!

157
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
Don't let them escape. Catch them!

158
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,640
"Andipatti"

159
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,320
"Arasampatti, Vadipatti, Vadugapatti."

160
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
"I like it."

161
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,160
"I like it."

162
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,920
"Usilampatti, Uchapatti, Kallipatti, Keeripatti."

163
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,960
"I like it."

164
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
"I like it."

165
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,000
"In districts in and out of Madurai"

166
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,200
"we are lions pouncing on our prey."

167
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,880
"To Veerappan, the notorious smuggler"

168
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,920
"we give a complex."

169
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,880
"In Keerathurai, Kalavasal, Keelamasi and Melamasi"

170
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,360
"we revel in daylight robbery."

171
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,880
"Super robbers!"

172
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,720
"We are super-duper robbers!"

173
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,240
"Super robbers!"

174
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,080
"We are super-duper robbers!"

175
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,760
"Andipatti, Arasampatti"

176
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,440
"Vadipatti, Vadugapatti."

177
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,480
"All four of us"

178
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,440
"are well known good-for-nothing loafers."

251

No house is closed. Let us steal.

252
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,760
I am in no mood to steal. Leave me alone.

253
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,560
This isn't an international business.

254
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,600
Do you need a mood to steal? Come on.

255
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,800
Bucket..

256
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,240
They are serving food for free at the adjacent street.

258
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,360
Go. Gobbling glutton!

259
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,840
I don't want to get my ears pierced. - Don't be scared, it won't hurt.

260
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,160
Occupy the place.

261
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,640
Move aside, ma'am.

262
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,800
Where's my girl?

263
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,240
Let the flies not eat your food!

264
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,960
Excuse me, your face looks so familiar!

265
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,040
But I'm unable to recollect.

266
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,520
Do you remember seeing me?

267
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,400
Hey!

268
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,880
How dare you touch me

269
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,720
without even thinking that I'm a girl!

270
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,680
I'll deal with you outside, once you finish your lunch.

271
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,800
Hey, gobbling glutton!

272
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,880
Did you eat to your heart's content?

273
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,600
As if you let me eat in peace!

274
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,000
Sit carefully.

275
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,040
Be on your guard for few days.

276
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,920
An inspector has been transferred here from Tirunelvelli.

277
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,400
He looks terrorizing.

278
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,000
He'll shoot you in an encounter, if you oppose him.

279
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,640
He'll be dealing with your cash.

280
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,600
Why will he deal with our cash? Is he an accountant?

281
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,080
Don't be a school master!

282
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,160
I meant our case, the complaint.

283
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,160
He was with Aarusamy.

284
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,920
He sports a handlebar moustache like actor Surya in the film 'Singam'.

285
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,920
Be careful.

286
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,960
Looks like he is up to no good.

287
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,320
Shall we peel his skin or make him pee?

288
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,440
I'm being serious and you're making fun of me!

289
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,160
Bucket, tell him, we taught Shakespeare to write 'Taming of the shrew'!

290
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,560
This 'inch' is zilch to us. Give us the address.

291
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,840
Stubborn people! No.13, 4th cross street, Subramaniapuram.

292
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,560
You've just arrived and you're already receiving a call.

293
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,040
Change your dress first, let's eat.

294
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,080
Hello!

295
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,280
Can I speak to the inspector from Tallakulam?

296
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,120
Who is this? - We supply buffaloes to the Lord of death!

297
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,600
Who the heck are you, man? - That's not important.

298
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,360
We heard a lot about you.

299
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,760
I believe, you intend to catch the cupboard-pulling thieves.

300
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,560
Try your luck. - Are you acting smart with me?

301
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,400
Why are you getting tense?

302
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,200
Note down this address. - Tell me.

303
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,640
13, 4th cross street, Subramaniapuram.

304
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,160
'Why have you noted down our own address, dear?'

305
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,520
Your wife is very smart! She has observed it correctly.

306
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,400
Open your cupboard.

307
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,760
Oh, God! They've stolen all my jewels.

308
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,560
My jewelry!

309
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,440
I can see the next house! - I'll take a look.

310
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,200
Cop's cash kaput!

311
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,360
I'm so confused.

312
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,120
The bar I'd dragged and brought here..

313
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,920
Where are they pushing it to?

314
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,120
Excuse me. May I know, what you are doing?

315
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,640
Can't you see for yourself? We are pushing the bar.

316
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,400
This is the 'no entry' zone.

317
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,480
How can you say it so casually?

318
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,200
This is public property.

319
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,720
Won't the common people question your move?

320
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,160
Tomorrow, after coming here, I'd have been disappointed not to see the bar.

321
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,840
Cheers!

322
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,520
Brother..

323
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,600
You say, it is a 'no entry' zone.

324
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,720
Can't you show the right way and lend me a hand in pushing?

325
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,080
Sorry, brother.

326
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,800
I can't do that.

327
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,680
My wife said that the temple is too far from our house.

328
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,560
I pushed it gradually and have just now, shifted it near my house.

329
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,360
I'm very tired. You push it.

330
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,160
Push it. Why are they pushing the empty bar?

331
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,640
Go straight and take the second right.

332
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,600
Don't wonder, why I'm walking so fast.

333
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,160
The boys are pushing the bar so fast.

334
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,040
Get lost! - I'll take care of the bottle.

335
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,280
I'll return the money, sir.

336
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,640
'I have a family.' - 'When you want money'

337
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,080
'you fold your hands.' - 'Please forgive me.'

338
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,760
'When I ask you to repay it, you raise your hand at me!'

339
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,360
'Cut his hand.' - 'Don't, sir.'

340
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,720
'How dare you!'

341
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,800
What's this?

342
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,640
Can't you see? It's called 'upma'!

343
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,560
You know, I don't like this.

344
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,800
Why have you served me this?

345
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,440
Serve me something else.

346
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,840
I'll punch you.

347
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,560
You're so thin.

348
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,280
I've made lamb curry to eat along with it.

349
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,760
At least, you'll put on some weight.

350
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,200
If I hate something, I don't change my mind about it.

351
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,560
You and your husband can stuff all the meat you want!

352
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,200
Don't aggravate my anger.

353
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,480
What temerity! - Hey!

354
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,480
Why are you screaming at night? - She acts like a son.

355
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,040
She troubles me so much.

356
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,800
She and her temper tantrums!

357
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,280
She's throwing away the plate at the wall!

358
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,880
Why do you provoke her? You know, she hates 'upma'!

359
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,000
You want me to hit my only child.

360
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,000
Hitting her is equivalent to disrespecting God!

361
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
Why do you defend her so much?

362
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
I pity the boy who marries her!

363
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,080
Where are you taking me?

364
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,880
Why are you torturing me by bringing me here this early in the morning?

365
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,080
Who is this clown? He's blinding me!

366
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,280
Keep quiet. - Wasn't I telling you

367
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,760
about your sister? She is the one.

368
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,080
I don't have a sister, dude. - Dude, I meant to say..

369
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,600
The angel who hugged me..

370
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,320
The girl in the yellow skirt.

371
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,160
She is beautiful, dude!

372
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,560
Thanks, dude! - You're hitting on the perfect one!

373
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,200
You are really great.

374
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,520
Did you realize that only now?

375
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,800
Okay, don't just stand here.

376
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,440
Go and talk to her. - Okay.

377
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,680
Look there. They are discussing you.

378
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,160
He's coming here. He'll come here and blabber.

379
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,640
'She does not look educated.' - He's right next to you now.

380
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,760
Is it so? - Excuse me!

381
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,080
You look familiar to me but I'm unable to recollect.

382
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,720
Do you remember seeing me?

383
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,360
Tell me.

384
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,320
'She is not responding.'

385
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,960
'I do look handsome.'

386
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,480
The color of your dress matches with his.

387
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,840
Shut up.

388
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,240
Dude! - Yes.

389
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,280
She is not responding.

390
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,080
What else do you expect with that expression of yours?

391
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,320
Which girl will respond?

392
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,600
How else to speak?

393
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,400
Like a flower, you should smile

394
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,360
and talk to girls.

395
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,880
Is that how you smile?

396
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,400
Have you ever seen anyone 'smile like a flower'?

397
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,160
You.. - Cool! Cool! Cool, dude.

398
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,760
Go and try your luck again.

399
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,800
Go on.

400
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,360
'Smile like a flower'?

401
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,400
Fine, I will smile that way.

402
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,560
Good morning, sister. - What's the matter?

403
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,520
Nothing, sister. - Am I your sister?

404
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
If male cops are called brothers-in-law

405
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,760
then, female cops are sisters, right? - I will thrash you.

406
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,400
Buddy, run! They are after us, wherever we go!

407
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,560
Who is this buffoon?

408
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,840
Why is he running so fast?

409
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,000
His face is so familiar

410
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,320
but somehow, I'm not able to recollect!

411
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,640
Let's go.

412
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,880
Good morning, sir. - Did you identify the caller?

413
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,440
We traced the call to a fruit shop.

414
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,440
Did you ask the shopkeeper? - The shop is closed, sir.

415
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,240
Come in with the file.

416
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,960
Aarumugam, Saravanan, Pazhani, Senthil.

417
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,720
These four are notorious thieves, sir.

418
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,520
How many thefts have happened in our area?

419
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,880
Seven and including your house, the count is eight, sir.

420
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,320
Robbery in the seven houses happened during daytime.

421
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,240
Your house alone was robbed at night, sir.

422
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,640
Which area has the maximum thefts?

423
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,600
Sokkikulam. - Let's go.

424
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,800
'They robbed you by breaking into your locker from the rear.'

425
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,800
'How will your disguise help?'

426
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,120
'They are giving all the cops a run for their salary!'

427
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,520
Will they try their smart moves on me?

428
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,040
'You think, I can't see through your disguise?'

429
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,040
'I know how to handle you.' - Put few milk packets also.

430
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,080
'They'll soon offer milk to your grave!'

431
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
Senthil..

432
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,760
The matter is getting serious. What are you looking at?

433
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,160
Fatso, I'm reading important headlines. - Stop it.

434
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,320
Be careful. That inspector and that constable

435
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,360
are delivering newspapers door to door.

436
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,640
Be careful. - Why are they delivering newspapers in our area?

437
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,080
Newspapers will pile up

438
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,240
and we'll go in to steal, thinking that no one is at home.

439
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,400
They'll nab us. So, stop stealing.

440
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
Hey! How can we give up our profession?

441
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,480
I'm only asking you to change the area.

442
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,440
Which area? - Meenakshipuram.

443
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,000
Enter the kingpin's house. Nobody will be around.

444
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,720
They are discussing the temple festival plans.

445
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,400
No one will be around until dusk.

446
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,160
Let's go.

447
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,320
My grandfather and his forefathers

448
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,920
have protected this temple for generations together.

449
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,440
The ceremony performed in this temple

450
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,480
is the respect shown to my forefathers. - Stop it!

451
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,240
You can't fool me the way you fooled my father.

452
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,840
I'll do the honors for the temple festival.

453
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,120
Do whatever you want.

454
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,040
It's not you or me who will decide

455
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,280
as to who will do the honors.

456
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,520
God will decide it this year.

457
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,120
Are you trying to challenge me?

458
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,920
I'm not challenging you.

459
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,920
I swear by the Goddess we all pray to.

460
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,600
Greetings! - Who are you?

461
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,800
Why did you come via the rear entrance?

462
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,440
Why are you at the back yard?

463
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,960
What do you want?

464
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,320
We are from 'Mannar and Company'.

465
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,040
We've been asked to deliver a cupboard here.

466
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,160
Is it my boss who has asked?

467
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,560
Yes. - Okay, bring it in.

468
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,840
If we don't get to conduct the temple festival this year

469
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,000
there's no point in us living.

470
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,520
Sir! - What?

471
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,240
Two men from 'Mannar and Company' have delivered a cupboard.

472
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,560
Cupboard? - Yes!

473
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,080
They said, you've ordered for it.

474
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,680
Me? - Yes, sir.

475
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,800
"The tiger roars, growls, snarls. Thunder claps, crashes, rumbles."

476
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,000
"The flags in truce, flutter on seeing the hunter enter."

477
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,680
"Intestines quake, tremble and shake." - Boss..

478
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,880
This must be their work. - "The flags in truce, flutter"

479
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,320
"on seeing the hunter enter." - Fetch our weapons.

480
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,880
"The tiger roars, growls, snarls. Thunder claps, crashes, rumbles."

481
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,920
Open that cupboard. - "The flags in truce, flutter"

482
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,480
"on seeing the hunter enter." Intestines quake"

483
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,600
"tremble and shake. The flags in truce, flutter"

484
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,280
"on seeing the hunter enter."

485
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,160
"Look at the hunter coming with pride."

486
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,600
Answer the call.

487
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,440
"The prey runs in fear."

488
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,000
Are you done?

489
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,480
Yes, I'm done!

490
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,600
Even I've read about the cupboard-pulling thieves.

491
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,360
But I never imagined, you'd dare to steal from my house!

492
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,080
Conmen to the core!

493
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,120
The cops are searching high and low for you.

494
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,680
That's why, we thought, we'd catch hold of one last haul

495
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,480
and settle down in life.

496
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,360
But he got caught!

497
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,960
I'm giving you an assignment because of your intelligence.

498
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,320
It's the most challenging contract.

499
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,680
It's the lion's den

500
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,160
where 1000 will be roaming around with sickles.

501
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,560
If you are not careful

502
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,680
along with my dignity getting tarnished

503
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,240
all of you will get killed too.

504
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,760
Hey! Eat!

505
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,240
If you aren't alert even for a moment

506
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,640
you will die.

507
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,320
Try your best.

508
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
Even my men will be there.

509
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,840
But in case, you get caught

510
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,280
my men will hack you to death.

511
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,040
If you can't, let me know.

512
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,920
We'll assume this to be one good feast, we had together.

513
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,920
We won't easily get our hands dirty.

514
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,000
When we do, we deliver.

515
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,600
How much do you want? - We'll protect your dignity.

516
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,080
You decide how much to pay us.

517
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,840
Be alert.

518
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,560
Not a single outsider should step into our area.

519
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,640
They shouldn't get away!

520
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,480
"Any kind of opposition, be ready for friction."

521
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,360
"Any interference, lock horns in self-defence."

522
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,120
"If anyone has a bone to pick, flare up double quick."

523
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,400
"Any meddling, muddling, don't spare."

524
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,200
"Wrestle and tussle. Treble trouble."

525
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,440
"Button yet to be pressed to immerse in this ruckus."

526
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,760
"Crackers go bonkers. Conflict conquers."

527
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,920
"If four friends get together, broil, bicker, fight boils over."

528
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,360
You guys are amazing!

529
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,120
I'm getting goose bumps.

530
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,200
I'm stunned.

531
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,560
You did the impossible!

532
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,960
Well done!

533
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,860
Mani..

534
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,740
Give the boys Rs.1 lakh. Let them be happy.

535
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,220
Okay, sir! - Hey!

536
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,100
Just one lakh? Without consulting us

537
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,260
how can you fix the rate? - How much do you want?

538
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,700
Dude, shoot.

539
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,620
It's.. - We owe our regular tea shop owner, Rs.520.

540
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,020
He asks for it whenever I go there. Ask for that too.

541
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,260
How petty can you be! - Hey!

542
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,020
What are you muttering over there?

543
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,780
Five lakhs only.

544
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,220
What? Five lakhs? - Yes.

545
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,860
Initially, I'd intended to pay you only Rs.50,000

546
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,620
but since you've taken such a huge risk

547
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,740
I decided to be generous enough to give you an additional Rs.50,000.

548
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,940
Are you demanding for Rs.5 lakhs? - Sir.

549
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,220
They are young boys. Why are you even giving them an explanation?

550
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,020
See if you are even able to count till 1 lakh. - Hey!

551
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,060
I even know to count the number of bones in your body!

552
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,180
Hey!

553
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,460
How dare you raise a hand at my friend?

554
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,220
Hey!

555
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,620
How dare you play dirty games with us!

556
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,100
If you cheat us

557
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,620
I'll burn you alive!

558
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,220
We came to lend you a helping hand

559
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,340
whereas you're hitting us. - Hey!

560
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,620
Those chaps are hitting our boss, get your weapons.

561
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,740
Come on. Take the sickle.

562
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,220
Do you consider us to be beggars?

563
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,660
We've saved your respect, dignity, pride and prestige.

564
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,740
We put our lives in danger to do your job.

565
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,860
We give our lives a s***.

566
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,980
If I tell them that the statue is in your house

567
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,740
the walls of your house won't remain intact.

568
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,260
They will demolish the entire house.

569
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,220
One who honors his word is a real gentleman!

570
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,900
Pay us the right amount. If we could take the statue

571
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,340
we won't hesitate to take you!

572
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,220
Mani.

573
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,380
Go in and get Rs.5,00,000 lakhs.

574
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,300
Hey!

575
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,900
If I wish, I can hack you to pieces right here.

576
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,620
But..

577
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,540
You had the courage to enter my house and attack me!

578
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,380
I'm sparing your lives only because the statue is in my house now.

579
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,020
Hey!

580
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,700
I've paid you what you asked for.

581
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,260
But I won't forget your assault on me.

582
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,540
You are answerable for that.

583
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,740
Let us know, when to answer. We'll fix a rate for that too!

584
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,500
We will take your leave. Come.

585
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,880
'One who honors his word is a real gentleman!'

586
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,600
'Pay us the right amount'.

587
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,840
'If we could take the statue'

588
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,240
'we won't hesitate to take you either!'

589
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,880
Sir!

590
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,320
Let's be patient.

591
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,200
Four kids.

592
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,280
Four kids came to my house and hit me.

593
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,920
They should regret all their life for hitting me.

594
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,280
Yes, Bucket. - Oh! They are here only.

595
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,640
Okay.

596
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,920
Hey!

597
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,520
What is this?

598
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,440
Why is he dressed up like actor Vishal in the film, 'Avan Ivan'?

599
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,960
Hey!

600
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,200
Pazhani!

601
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,400
I think, he's under the influence of black magic.

602
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,760
Get him exorcised!

603
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,240
Come with me. Bucket wants us.

604
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,480
He thinks, he is actor Ramarajan's heir!

605
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,320
Dude. - What?

606
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,640
I don't know if my girl will accept my love.

607
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,400
I don't know why

608
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,960
but the very thought of her

609
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,040
electrifies my body, dude.

610
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,520
We shouldn't hesitate at all.

611
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,840
We are not answerable to anyone.

612
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,600
Directly go to her and ask her, how she feels about you.

613
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,760
But I'm terrified to go and ask her that.

614
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,240
Why are you terrified?

615
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,240
You have robbed so many houses so easily.

616
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,080
Don't you know to steal a girl's heart?

617
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,480
Profess your love to her.

618
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,680
I'll also come with you.

619
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,080
But how do I do that?

620
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,360
Dude, your girl is coming.

621
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,960
Your guy is standing there.

622
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,640
Do I look okay?

623
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,000
Absolutely handsome!

624
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,040
Ignore him.

625
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,960
I need to talk to you in private.

626
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,560
Are you eve-teasing us?

627
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,720
Hey, you! Muck face!

628
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,440
Dude, deal with them.

629
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,920
Hey, muck face, come here. I'll get you something to eat.

630
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,360
Let's go. - Come here. Stand aside.

631
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,280
I'm trying to recall.

632
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,040
I can remember everything else except for that incident.

633
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,320
What's your problem?

634
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,920
Why are you following me unnecessarily?

635
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,280
Will a boy follow a girl without any reason?

636
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,400
Every time I think of you, my heart starts pounding hard!

637
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,840
I think, I'm in love with you.

638
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,720
Go away from here.

639
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,240
If my father gets to know, he'll kill you.

640
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,240
I'll handle it.

641
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,960
I know, risk is involved.

642
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,920
And I'm ready to take that risk.

643
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,360
Forget that.

644
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,000
Just tell me if you love me or not.

645
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,640
I have no such feelings. Leave.

646
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,800
You lied to me, didn't you?

647
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,720
I felt your love when you hugged me.

648
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,840
I'm so 'kappy'!

649
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,200
Dude, she hugged me.

650
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,080
I'm so 'kappy'!

651
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,040
What's wrong with him?

652
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,840
He's laughing weirdly. He's acting so weird.

653
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,160
He's in love with a beautiful girl.

654
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,040
She is that loan-shark, Rajendran's daughter.

655
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,200
She hugged him today.

656
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,600
Really? Oh!

657
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,040
That's what he is recalling!

658
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,760
Saravana

659
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,560
falling in love with a rowdy's daughter is dangerous.

660
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,720
First, she'll ruin the business

661
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,080
and then, she'll ruin our friendship.

662
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,720
Especially, don't trust these girls from Madurai.

663
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,480
Either like actress Sandhya in the film 'Kaadhal'

664
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,200
they will marry someone else and make you loony..

665
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Super performance!

666
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Or like actress Swathi in 'Subramanipuram'

667
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,440
they'll betray you and get you killed. Be careful.

668
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,680
Yes. We'll then, have to roam around with sickles

669
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
to take revenge.

670
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,080
Hey! Why are you maligning my girl for no reason?

671
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,280
Hey, come here.

672
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,400
Go. He'll share a military secret with you. Go.

673
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,000
Aarumugam

674
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,680
have you heard of 'as thick as thieves'?

675
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,400
That suits them well.

676
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,200
They're degrading my love. You are not defending me.

677
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
And you call yourself my friend?

678
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,720
Won't you support me? - Dude..

679
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,440
I was doing just that.

680
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,920
Just like I supported you when she hugged you

681
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,280
I was discussing of ways to get you united.

682
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,520
Thanks, dude.

683
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,240
Dude.

684
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,040
I must share a secret with you.

685
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,120
Tell me.

686
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,720
Hey! This looks new. Where did you steal this from?

687
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,160
This belongs to my girl.

688
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,160
Out of sheer habit, I flicked it, when I hugged her!

689
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,960
That's heights of professionalism!

690
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,400
You didn't think twice before stealing from the girl you love.

691
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,280
That proves, how much you respect your profession.

692
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,440
Dedication to your job is very important!

693
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,760
Like how Actor Vijay gave a chain in 'Kadhalukku Mariyadhai'

694
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,200
to prove his love

695
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,800
I'll unite you both with this chain.

696
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,440
I'll unite you both.

697
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,720
Thanks, dude.

698
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,600
Hey!

699
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,960
Her face is familiar, but..

700
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,080
Back to square one! - I'm unable to recollect..

701
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,200
You?

702
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
Dude!

703
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,920
Dude!

704
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,280
I am unable to eat or sleep properly.

705
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,800
I'm even unable to steal!

706
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,960
Don't take it literally.

707
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,400
Darn my tongue for blabbering!

708
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,320
You don't have to doubt my love at all.

709
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,480
My love is confirmed.

710
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,120
If you confirm too

711
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,480
I'll be so happy.

712
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,720
To have found me

713
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,200
you are very lucky.

714
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,600
Get lost, you idiot!

715
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,000
This place is swarming with my father's goons.

716
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,960
If they see you, they'll kill you.

717
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,480
Get going! - This will do for me.

718
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,200
You're concerned that your father's men will kill me.

719
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,360
That concern is enough for me.

720
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,160
I've come to know that I reside in your heart.

721
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,480
Now, I won't disturb you at all.

722
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,960
You go in and pray.

723
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,240
I'll wait for you outside.

724
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,800
Thank you, God.

725
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,320
Hereafter, I won't steal from your cashbox!

726
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,920
Who are you?

727
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,480
You? - Come with me.

728
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,120
Move. Come on.

729
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,600
Don't hang around.

730
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,760
I don't see him anywhere.

731
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,360
Do you know, whom you are flirting with so openly?

732
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,440
Hit him.

733
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,320
Let's go.

734
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,600
Looks like they have smashed my nose.

735
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,160
Why has a crowd gathered here?

736
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,560
Oh, God! - Oh, God! Buddy!

737
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,040
Saravana! - Be careful.

738
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,360
What happened? - I banged against a wall.

739
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,280
Who? - You banged against the wall? - I've broken my nasal bone.

740
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,240
Why couldn't you be careful? - Don't feel.

741
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,640
Did you think, they would spare him

742
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,880
if he flirts with loan-shark, Rajendran's daughter?

743
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,040
That's why, he has got a broken nose now!

744
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,840
Take him to the hospital. - Take him. - Go.

745
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,720
Take him carefully. - Take him carefully.

746
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,400
He came to the temple today. - Is it so?

747
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,800
He looked really funny with sacred ash all over his forehead.

748
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,800
Who are you?

749
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,400
Why are you here?

750
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,740
Hey! All of you, come out!

751
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,400
Mom, why is the noise level at its peak today?

752
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,520
If you indulge in slaughter and massacre

753
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,480
the sounds are bound to be high decibel only!

754
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,080
Your father's goons

755
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,280
must be thrashing someone who hasn't repaid his money.

756
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,560
Hey!

757
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,400
Why is he running with a sickle in a fit of rage?

758
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,480
Go and check.

759
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,440
My daughter!

760
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,680
Who are you? Let her go.

761
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,760
Stop!

762
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,280
Let go of me.

763
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,680
I'll kill her.

764
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,240
Are you a big shot?

765
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,760
It's natural for boys to admire girls!

766
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,160
So, will you send your men to hit him?

767
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,440
Ask them to face me now.

768
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,280
Do you think, he's an orphan?

769
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,640
I'll hack you to pieces. What crime did he commit?

770
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,280
Did he make you pregnant and then, ditch you?

771
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,920
How dare you have him hit!

772
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,400
I told you long back

773
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,120
not to have anything to do with this female.

774
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,840
Look!

775
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,440
We have no family.

776
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,640
But, you!

777
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,040
I'll kill you without any hesitation. - Come.

778
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,200
You'll be a corpse, unidentifiable.

779
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,880
Let's go. - Let go of me.

780
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,960
Where had you been?

781
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,000
To your father-in-law's house!

782
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,240
I'll break your bones. - Hey!

783
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,000
Did I tell you that she was the reason, I got bashed up?

784
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,280
Dude..

785
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,080
Be glad, she's still alive.

786
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,640
He would've made her headless if I had not stopped him.

787
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,120
Move aside. - Hey, hey.

788
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,720
Senthil. Wait.

789
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,960
You promised to unite us, instead, you're being a pain in the neck!

790
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,120
I'll do anything for your love.

791
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,520
But if they dare to hit you

792
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,200
I will be the first one to attack.

793
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,200
I'll kill the whole lot of them.

794
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,440
To heck with your love story!

795
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,280
What happened?

796
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,400
We hit a boy in the temple who had misbehaved with your daughter.

797
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,320
In retaliation, his friends came here and hit us.

798
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,320
Which area?

799
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,720
I saw them at the temple.

800
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,160
Welcome home, big shot!

801
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,920
Who are those scumbags?

802
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,320
Some guys threatened to kill her with a sickle!

803
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,360
Did I give birth to my only child to be slaughtered like a lamb?

804
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,600
What's going on here?

805
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,040
You twirl your moustache in pride.

806
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,480
But they had the audacity to come here!

807
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,720
Aren't you ashamed of yourself? - Get lost!

808
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,160
Go inside.

809
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,120
All you know is to vent out your anger on me! - Vela!

810
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,120
I'll go back to my mother's house. - Yes, sir.

811
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,360
How dare they enter my house and threaten my daughter?

812
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,920
Search the entire Madurai.

813
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,440
Kill them as soon as you find them. - Okay, sir.

814
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,800
Stop!

815
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,200
What will you achieve by killing them?

816
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,840
You are the cause for this problem.

817
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,200
Wherever I go, you have men breathing down my neck.

818
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,320
These blockheads are the culprits.

819
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,320
He asked me the way to the shrine, that's all.

820
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,760
They misunderstood it and broke his nose.

821
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,720
Will his friends keep quiet?

822
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,200
So..

823
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,000
They came and showed their might!

824
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,840
End this matter here, dad.

825
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,720
Even if there's some truth in what she said

826
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,640
her eyes are lying!

827
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,480
Kill them as soon as you find them.

828
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,280
"Don't trust girls."

829
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,600
"They are not trustworthy."

830
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:29,120
'He considers himself to be a genius.'

831
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,440
'With the intelligence that I possess'

832
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,160
'I should have been in America.' - Answer the call.

833
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,840
'He considers himself to be a genius.'

834
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,080
Hello?

835
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,640
I'm Saravanan. Are you?

836
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,440
'Even after getting beaten up, he won't stop talking in broken English!'

837
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,520
Hello! Why silent? Talk me.

838
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,280
I'm Meenakshi here.

839
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,160
Meenakshi? Which Meenakshi?

840
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,800
Whom you torture by saying, 'Excuse me, your face looks familiar'..

841
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,640
I am the same Meenakshi.

842
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,000
'How did she get my number?'

843
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,120
Hello.. Hello?

844
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,400
What a surprise call!

845
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,720
I never expected this call.

846
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,520
Meet me at Arthi inn tomorrow.

847
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,400
Okay.

848
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,560
Dude, my girl wants to meet me.

849
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,680
Why do you think she's calling me?

850
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,240
It could be to give fermentation to your wounds?

851
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,760
We've seen this in so many films.

852
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,160
Your love has begun!

853
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,000
Her father will ask his goons to break my bones

854
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,920
while she wants to bond with me? - That's right.

855
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,520
Most of the times, fathers push the daughters to fall in love.

856
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,560
All these days, when you followed her

857
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,840
did she even acknowledge you?

858
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,360
As soon as her father's thugs hit you

859
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,200
sympathy made her love you.

860
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,160
Fathers fan the fire of love, in children with no such thoughts.

861
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,800
They should be killed first.

862
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,360
It must surely be love. Go and enjoy.

863
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,960
Enjoy. Super, dude!

864
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,520
You are 'great knowledge'.

865
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,000
Thanks, dude. - Okay.

866
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,360
"Girlfriend of a burglar!"

867
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,320
Excuse me.

868
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,600
Your face looks so familiar.

869
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,680
Do you remember seeing me?

870
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,120
"Girlfriend of a burglar!"

871
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,800
"Girlfriend of a burglar!"

872
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,280
"You softened my tough heart."

873
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,920
"You softened it."

874
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,320
"You stole my soul"

875
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,640
"and melted my heart."

876
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,160
"With your magnetic eyes"

877
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,840
"you lured me, enchanted me."

878
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,360
"I am, I love you."

879
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,960
"You love me, don't you?"

880
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,720
"Perplexed, perturbed visibly"

881
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,920
"I drink and lament daily."

882
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,400
"I am so happy!"

883
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,880
"You happy, tell."

884
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,640
"I sweet-talk, I lay it on thick."

885
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,000
"In my dreams, I float euphoric."

886
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,240
"Girlfriend of the burglar!"

887
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,680
"Girlfriend of the burglar!"

888
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,560
"You softened my tough heart."

889
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,120
"You softened it."

890
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,240
"I see heaven daily"

891
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,600
"only to be re-born."

892
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,200
"My heart is in a delirious plight."

893
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,920
"Love kills me, day and night."

894
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,240
"I get the jitters, I am at sea."

895
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,640
"I think of only you, my baby."

896
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,160
"My heart is in disturbed delight."

897
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,840
"Life wants you and me to unite."

898
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,160
"Girl, my dear princess, true."

899
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,560
"I'll keep you safe in my eyes."

900
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,960
"My dear honeybunch.."

901
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,520
"I yearn for you."

902
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,280
"Yes, yes, excuse me."

903
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,400
"Your love, give please."

904
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,600
"Girlfriend of the burglar!"

905
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,720
"Girlfriend of the burglar!"

906
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,480
"You softened my tough heart."

907
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,120
"You softened it!"

908
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,440
"Like Romeo and Juliet"

909
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,640
"our love is a hit."

910
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,160
"My heartbeats palpitate."

911
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,040
"My eyes look for you desperately."

912
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,320
"You appreciate me captivatingly."

913
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,600
"I fall for it completely."

914
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,120
"I feel the rush of blood rapturously."

915
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,920
"Cupid's arrow, you've lodged in me."

916
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,480
"Lord Brahma, Lord Brahma"

917
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,720
"created this gilded statue."

918
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,480
"In your beauty's purview"

919
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,800
"I lost myself."

920
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,400
"Love, love, lovely.."

921
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,640
"I'm waiting for you daily."

922
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,080
"Girlfriend of the burglar!"

923
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,800
"Girlfriend of the burglar!"

924
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,640
"You softened my tough heart."

925
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,120
"You softened it."

926
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,440
"You stole my heart."

927
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,720
"You melted my heart."

928
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,400
"With your magnetic eyes"

929
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,080
"you lured me, enchanted me."

930
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,680
"I am, I love you."

931
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,120
"You love me, don't you?"

932
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,840
"Perplexed, perturbed visibly"

933
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,240
"I drink and lament daily."

934
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,640
"I am so happy!"

935
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,240
"You happy, tell."

936
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,000
"I sweet-talk, I lay it on thick."

937
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,360
"In my dreams, I float euphoric."

938
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,720
"Profess your love to me."

939
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,200
Good afternoon.

940
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,640
Excuse me. - 'This seems to be an expensive restaurant.'

941
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,320
'I'll probably burgle this place someday.'

942
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,360
One veg-rice. - Okay.

943
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,080
One gobi manchurian with gravy. - Okay.

944
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,320
One sweet corn. - Okay.

945
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,560
Two juice. - Okay, ma'am.

946
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,640
Water melon. - Anything else, ma'am?

947
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,560
One creamy pasta. - Okay, ma'am.

948
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,280
Hey! Don't bring it fast. Make it slow.

949
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,880
I have lots to talk.

950
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,560
I'm Saravanan.

951
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,360
What is your name?

952
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,160
Meenakshi. - Meenakshi?

953
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,200
Beautiful name!

954
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,840
What is your father?

955
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,400
Businessman. - Businessman.

956
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,480
B. Meenakshi. Very good name.

957
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,960
'What is your father' means, what is his job?

958
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,400
'Then, why didn't you say that he is a loan-shark?'

959
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,360
'Let me handle this.'

960
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,440
Sorry.

961
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,000
It was a slip of the tongue.

962
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,680
I should be the one apologizing to you. - Why?

963
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,960
You keep saying that my face is familiar.

964
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,120
Actually, even I feel the same.

965
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,320
Really?

966
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,400
All those who fell in love with me are in the graveyard now.

967
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,360
That's why, I stepped back every time you approached me.

968
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,120
Okay.

969
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,040
Your friends support you like your backbone.

970
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,240
Looks like they'll be ready to even die for you!

971
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,040
To have such friends

972
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,840
you should consider yourself to be truly blessed. - Thanks a lot.

973
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,880
So, why don't you tell what you are supposed to?

974
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,760
I love you! - 'Bravo! Congrats!'

975
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,480
'Bravo! Congrats!' 'Bravo! Congrats!'

976
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,400
Hello, lunch is here. Have.

977
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:05,520
I'd never imagined that you'd accept my love so soon!

978
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,880
I have to give you this.

979
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,520
You like?

980
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,360
This..

981
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,720
This is my chain.

982
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,600
Are you a thief? - Hello.

983
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,240
Like the slip of my tongue, it slipped into my pocket that day.

984
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,280
And you are calling me a thief!

985
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,840
No, you are a thief!

986
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,880
I had a doubt, when you hugged me the other day!

987
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,440
Rascal!

988
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,600
Are thieves such low-life to you?

989
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,000
Who doesn't steal in this country?

990
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,800
Is your father above board?

991
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,000
Check that menu card to see the price of the 'idli'.

992
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,800
Just check it.

993
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,440
Rs.30.

994
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,920
If they can sell Rs.2 worth 'idli' for Rs.30..

995
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,200
Isn't this robbery?

996
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,480
You can buy 15 'idlis' for that money. Forget this.

997
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,280
For a year, the Government

998
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,080
can admit only 1,00,000 students for an engineering course.

999
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,040
But they build more colleges and join 15,00,000 people

1000
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,880
and grab money from 14,00,000 people.

1001
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,800
What we do is blatant.

1002
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,720
They do it behind the scenes. That's it.

1003
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,280
Still, you should not bestow upon me, the title of a thief.

1004
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,280
I happen to be your lover.

1005
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,720
So? Isn't stealing a crime?

1006
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,600
Look, we are like income tax officers.

1007
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,320
We steal from the wealthy.

1008
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,000
They break open the wall.

1009
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,000
We break into a cupboard!

1010
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,960
I can't win any argument with you. - That's true.

1011
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,560
Finish eating and wash your hands.

1012
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,720
Where did he go?

1013
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,120
He must have gone to Mandhara's tea shop.

1014
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,320
Call him. - Aarumugam.

1015
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,520
Maybe he's in the bathroom.

1016
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,080
The bathroom door is open.

1017
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,160
'He considers himself to be a genius.'

1018
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,440
He hasn't taken the phone.

1019
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,760
'For the intelligence I possess'

1020
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,600
'I should have been in America.'

1021
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,400
Hey, check if his lover's number is there.

1022
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,080
Her number is not there.

1023
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,760
Aarumugam, see if he's there at the tea shop.

1024
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,920
Hey, Mandhara..

1025
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:18,960
Did Saravana come here?

1026
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,520
Yes. Some time back

1027
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,000
a girl took him along on her bike. - 'Bike?'

1028
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,720
Tell me. - He went with some girl on a bike.

1029
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,240
I guess, it must be his girl.

1030
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,860
He has gone with her again. He might get into some tussle.

1031
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,500
Go and look for him.

1032
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:02,820
Stop. - Talk to me with respect.

1033
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:06,060
I'll cut your throat! Wretch!

1034
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,780
I should have killed you that day itself.

1035
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,140
Where is Saravanan? - I haven't met him today.

1036
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,980
You are always suspicious of me. - Don't lie to me.

1037
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,660
I know about your rowdy family very well.

1038
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,020
Mind your tongue!

1039
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,620
Don't drag my father into this. Why should he hide Saravanan?

1040
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,880
If anything happens to Saravanan

1041
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,440
I'll annihilate your entire family.

1042
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,320
Tell me.

1043
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,560
He's back. He's happily lying down and relaxing.

1044
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,160
Come back home.

1045
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,520
When did he get back? Where had he gone?

1046
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,840
He had gone to the hospital.

1047
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,360
He got stuck in the lift because of power cut.

1048
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,600
How can we blame him for that?

1049
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,480
Who knows where he got stuck? Love is also like electricity.

1050
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,040
No one can predict if it will electrocute or exterminate!

1051
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,840
'He considers himself to be a genius.'

1052
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,920
'With the intelligence that I possess, I should have been in America.'

1053
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,480
'He assumes..'

1054
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,960
Hello? - I'm Meenakshi speaking.

1055
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,480
I want to meet you.

1056
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,000
Come to Azhagappar Chettinad hotel tomorrow.

1057
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,400
I'll come wherever you ask me to come!

1058
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,760
Order whatever you like. - Aren't you having anything?

1059
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,600
I already had.

1060
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,680
Your father's goons. Bend down.

1061
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,360
Get up! - Bend down.

1062
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,800
First, get up!

1063
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,040
That's the end of my story. - Bala!

1064
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,640
Yes, ma'am. - Why are you here?

1065
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,000
I came for some take-away. - Okay. - Okay.

1066
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,520
Hello.

1067
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,640
Why did you call him? What if he informed your dad about us?

1068
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,160
That's exactly why I called him.

1069
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,800
Won't I hesitate to tell my father

1070
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,120
that I'm in love with a thief? That's why.

1071
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,200
You are a very bold girl.

1072
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,960
Obviously, how else, can I hang around with a thief like you?

1073
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,320
Can I ask you something? I hope, you won't misunderstand me.

1074
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,560
I'll never misunderstand you.

1075
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,840
God has given you two gifts. One is me and the other, your friends.

1076
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,320
Whom will you choose? - First, I'll choose this chicken!

1077
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,920
You are a scumbag, thief and an illiterate bumpkin.

1078
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,840
Despite knowing all this, I fell in love with you.

1079
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,520
But your friend hisses at me like a snake

1080
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,240
every time he sees me.

1081
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,480
He threatens me with a knife in broad daylight.

1082
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,880
I'll ask you to marry me

1083
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,240
and take you away from your friends.

1084
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,960
Why are you washing your hands?

1085
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,920
Saravana! Saravana!

1086
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,360
Stop, Saravana!

1087
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,240
Saravana! Stop!

1088
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,160
What have I spoken for you to walk off in anger?

1089
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,480
Listen, you asked me

1090
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,640
whom I will choose if God asks me to choose between the two of you.

1091
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,440
I'll choose my friends over you.

1092
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,440
They mean the world to me.

1093
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,480
He's just hinting to me to leave you.

1094
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,640
If he insists, I'll ditch you and walk away.

1095
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:25,760
If you dare to talk ill of them.. Get lost!

1096
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,840
I'm not getting any scape-goat today! - 'Ladies and gentlemen!'

1097
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,120
Got it!

1098
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:57,240
Welcome to my net! Right into my trap.

1099
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,720
'Wow! Beautiful!'

1100
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,800
Crap! - Welcome to Madurai.

1101
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,320
I'm a guide. Do you want my services?

1102
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,960
Yes. - I'm Pitt. 'Fraud' Pitt.

1103
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,080
I'm Cruise. Tom Cruise.

1104
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,760
Nice name, sir. - Thank you.

1105
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,200
Look, sir, total Madurai inside.

1106
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,680
Nice. You have something else?

1107
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,720
What? - Tamil figure?

1108
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,480
Tamil figure? - Yeah.

1109
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,080
Really? - Yes!

1110
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,520
Foreigners love Tamil much more than we do!

1111
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,240
Sir, please come on. - Okay.

1112
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,440
These are the Tamil figures.

1113
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,800
A, B, C, D..

1114
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,240
No, no. - What?

1115
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,480
Tamil figure!

1116
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,360
Tamil figure? - Yeah.

1117
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:55,760
We visit Goa to lure your girls

1118
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,400
while you come here to do the same, isn't it?

1119
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,520
You don't know about the girls in Madurai.

1120
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,000
They'll rip you off your shirt and hit you.

1121
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,400
What happened? - Nothing.

1122
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:07,280
I have three big figures. I'll introduce you, come.

1123
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,440
Thank you.

1124
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,960
'You are the scape goat to be slaughtered.'

1125
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,640
I'm not getting any joker at all.

1126
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,520
The joker you wanted is right behind you!

1127
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,920
You bet, he has got hold of a proper joker!

1128
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,480
Who are all these? - They are my close friends. - Oh!

1129
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,480
Who is this foreigner? Where did you find him?

1130
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,360
In Star Movies. He wants Tamil girls.

1131
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,280
You speak fluent English. Ask him what he wants.

1132
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,080
What's your name? - I'm Cruise. Tom Cruise.

1133
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,400
And what's your name? - Lee. Bruce Lee.

01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,600
He Jet-Li. He Idli! - Hello, boss.

1135
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,760
Oh, really? Very funny.

1136
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,720
Did you say 'Panni', meaning pork? You idiot!

1137
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,040
All are funny.

1138
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,480
Oh, my God!

1139
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,880
'Will you ever ask for a Tamil girl again?'

1140
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,360
Which place? - Temple area.

1141
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,160
Let's go.

1142
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,200
Hello, excuse me, give one packet.

1143
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,520
How much? - Rs.70.

1144
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,760
You change dollar? - String that dollar around your neck.

1145
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,480
Give me the cash first. - No Indian money!

1146
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,000
What you funny people! Funny shop owner!

1147
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,720
Get lost, you! - Watch your tongue!

1148
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,200
I sleep with explosives under my pillow!

1149
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,280
Idli, Jet Li, Bruce Lee.. There are three of them.

1150
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,600
They will break your shop.

1151
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,360
Turn back, you'll see Dong Lee from the film 'Ezhaam Arivu'.

1152
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,640
Dong Lee? Who is this Dong Lee?

1153
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:54,440
How dare you hit my friends! I'll kill you.

1154
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,680
Did you dare to hit a cop?

1155
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:04,920
Let's go.

1156
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,960
Catch him. Fast.

1157
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:22,040
This cap suits you better! - Fool! Untie me.

1158
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,000
Search Madurai's every street, every nook and corner.

1159
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,680
Find him and kill him. - Okay, sir.

1160
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:45,520
<i>'He considers himself to be a genius.'</i>

1161
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,600
<i>I'm at the bar. What is it?</i>

1162
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,120
<i>Forgive me.</i>

1163
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,120
<i>I didn't realize, your friends mean a lot to you.</i>

1164
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:57,600
<i>I want to see you. Drop by on your way home.</i>

1165
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:01,560
<i>I'm neck deep in a problem now. - What problem?</i>

1166
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,960
<i>We hit a policeman. The cops are hunting for us.</i>

1167
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,720
<i>I'll tell my father and ask him to handle it.</i>

1168
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,440
<i>I want to see you. Please!</i>

1169
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,400
<i>Don't cry. I'll be there.</i>

1170
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,120
<i>One more kilometer.</i>

1171
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:37,360
<i>Push, push hard.</i>

1172
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,560
<i>The cops are looking for us. Be on your toes.</i>

1173
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,720
<i>Hey! - Push with all your strength.</i>

1174
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:45,960
Hey!

1175
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:51,680
<i>Sorry, boss. I didn't know, you were inside.</i>

1176
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:57,040
<i>Forgive me. Without knowing that you're inside, I pushed the bar this far.</i>

1177
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,720
<i>Don't worry. Take my bike keys. - For what?</i>

1178
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,320
<i>I'll push this bar back only after two days.</i>

1179
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,600
<i>I'll take it from you then. For now, you can use my bike.</i>

1180
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:08,920
Please go. - Fool!

1181
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,560
Giving his bike key to a thief! - I will take care. - Here.

1182
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:12,720
Come on!

1183
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,720
<i>'Don't raise your voice at me and stop treating me like a kid.'</i>

1184
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:20,480
<i>'Take your hands off!' - Very tired. Small break.</i>

1185
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,280
<i>'He's become a big shot. He can take care of himself.'</i>

1186
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,480
<i>I'm Kasinathan speaking. - Tell me.</i>

1187
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,680
<i>Those boys are heading towards Meenakshipuram.</i>

1188
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,920
<i>Will you hit a policeman?</i>

1189
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,120
<i>I'll show you, what a cop is capable of doing!</i>

1190
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,400
<i>Hey, careful!</i>

1191
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:26,280
How will I face his family?

1192
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:43,220
We were following them down this bridge, sir.

1193
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:44,740
Suddenly, they switched off the light, killed him

1194
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,100
and ran away.

1195
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,060
Did any of you witness this? - No, sir.

1196
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:50,020
Where do you stay? - Third street, sir.

1197
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:51,740
Which area are you from? - Near the pond.

1198
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:53,460
None of you saw this happen? - No, sir.

1199
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:15,460
How atrocious! They've killed a police man.

1200
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:18,700
If policemen are not safe, how will the public trust the police?

1201
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:19,940
Did you get any information about the murderer?

1202
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:22,300
Four thieves, two of them are involved in this, sir.

1203
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:24,860
Find out all the details and arrest them immediately.

1204
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:26,820
Send this body for post-mortem at once. - Okay, sir.

1205
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:35,700
Sir!

1206
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:39,060
You..

1207
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,380
Send the body for post-mortem and inform his family members.

1208
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,580
Yes, sir. - Don't miss out a single rowdy in Madurai.

1209
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:46,220
Chop their legs off and make them immobile. - Yes, sir.

1210
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:48,100
Bring the bike to the station.

1211
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:13,140
Pazhani..

1212
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,740
Why are you crying?

1213
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:24,820
Don't cry. If we cry our grief will reduce.

1214
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,460
Till we avenge his death

1215
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:32,340
we should not shed a single tear!

1216
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:35,580
Get up!

1217
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:49,700
"Let us arise from down beneath."

1218
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:53,500
"Answer ready, army to attack. Memories of you bounce back."

1219
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:57,540
"Let us arise from down beneath."

1220
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,780
"For you, my dear friend."

1221
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:20,420
"Eight directions on red alert. Heart's furnace ablaze, overt."

1222
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:24,220
"In our eyes, his face flashes. Let the world burn down to ashes."

1223
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:26,180
"Day to search the seed of dissent.

1224
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,140
"Date to ferret the foe 100 percent."

1225
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:31,980
"In the whole world, friend.. That one word is so wonderful."

1226
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:35,660
"Dear friend in the whole world.."

1227
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:39,620
"Dear friend in the whole world.."

1228
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:43,500
"Dear friend in the whole world.."

1229
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:47,300
"To avenge, settle scores.. Anguish makes the blood roar."

1230
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:51,100
"For the storm to abate within, let the hunt begin."

1231
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,020
"Childhood friendship.."

1232
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:54,940
"So precious to slay in a web of deceit is atrocious."

1233
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,860
"Today will be tribute to his obituary." - Did you eat?

1234
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,860
"Let the world tremble."

1235
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:06,140
"Friend forever.."

1236
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,420
Here, keep the change. "Friend forever.."

1237
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:13,860
"Friend forever.."

1238
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:16,020
Hey, Pazhani! Look at his parents.

1239
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:19,180
Aren't they lovely together? Where are your parents?

1240
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:21,420
They are no more. - We are there for you.

1241
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:23,820
Let's keep a name for him first. - Yes. - Come on. - Let's go.

1242
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:28,460
Pazhani, Aarumugam, Senthil..

1243
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:31,500
You're Saravanan from today. He's our friend for life.

1244
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:40,300
"Fate's hands in a net of treachery."

1245
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:44,020
"Friend's life ended in trickery."

1246
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:47,940
"Skulk of foxes holed up happily"

1247
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:51,620
"after killing a cheetah heartily."

1248
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:55,100
"Blood bath, a war footing offering."

1249
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:59,100
"End of the ritual is nearing."

1250
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:02,860
"Let the disquiet conscience submerge in violence."

1251
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:04,700
"Even a dip in the sea"

1252
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:07,420
"refuse to douse the rage in the heart."

1253
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:12,380
He is showing off to me. See.

1254
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
"The rising fire in the heart"

1255
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,480
"turns the world into a singed shore."

1256
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,640
"The red soil, blood saturated"

1257
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:57,200
"will be another battle ground."

1258
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,720
"A chess game dawns with humans as pawns."

1259
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,640
"Let's take it as a deal to make the beasts kneel."

1260
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,760
"Eight directions on red alert."

1261
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:12,360
"Heart's furnace ablaze, overt. In our eyes, his face flashes."

1262
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,520
"Day to search the seed of dissent.

1263
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,360
"Date to ferret the foe 100 percent."

1264
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,240
"Unshed tears salute a friend."

1265
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:24,080
"To avenge, settle scores. Anguish makes the blood roar."

1266
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:27,760
"For the storm to abate within, let the hunt begin."

1267
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,840
"Childhood friendship.."

1268
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,720
"So precious to kill in a web of deceit, heinous."

1269
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,640
"Today will be a tribute to his obituary"

1270
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,000
"let the world tremble."

1271
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,040
I really don't know how to console you.

1272
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,600
No one can compensate the death of a friend.

1273
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,520
It will be difficult for you.

1274
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,160
Our elders say

1275
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,640
God takes away the ones He loves the most.

1276
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,160
I feel terrible.

1277
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:50,320
Don't cry, Saravana. He'll always be with you.

1278
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,720
Saravana!

1279
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,040
Why did you come here?

1280
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,600
As if only you can console him!

1281
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,760
Only after you entered his life, we have been plagued with problems.

1282
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,760
I feel disgusted to even look at your face.

1283
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:14,940
Go, otherwise, I'll kill you right here.

1284
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:16,900
Leave.

1285
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:30,180
The cops are looking for us. Let's leave this place.

1286
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,380
Greetings, sir.

1287
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:40,980
Greetings!

1288
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:43,100
Who are these men? - Pickpocket. - What?

1289
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,020
Pickpocket. - Bike thief.

1290
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:48,660
Are you running a brothel?

1291
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:53,220
Yes, but I'm paying him my dues correctly, sir.

1292
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,100
Who are you?

1293
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,620
Won't you tell him, sir?

1294
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:02,540
How many times should I repeat?

1295
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:05,860
You idiot! You think, you can get away after degrading a policeman?

1296
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:07,860
Rascal, get lost.

1297
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:09,220
Listen. - Sir. - Ensure every single thug is behind bars.

1298
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:11,740
Don't spare anyone. - Come on. Fast. Fast. Go in.

1299
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:12,900
You've no idea what the police can do!

1300
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:14,300
Are you trying to get me into trouble?

1301
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:15,600
I know, how to handle you.

1302
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:16,160
Sir!

1303
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,640
They say cops catch a thief by throwing a net.

1304
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,960
Why didn't you use that net on me?

1305
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,760
I'll smash your face.

1306
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,840
His bike was found at the crime spot.

1307
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,200
Greetings!

1308
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,360
Sir is taking his weapon out!

1309
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,520
Where is the rest of your gang? - Gang?

1310
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:39,920
All those who drink with me in the bar are part of my gang.

1311
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,520
If you want to take their head count

1312
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,720
you must shut down the Government wine shop.

1313
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:47,440
What is he blabbering? - Who took your bike?

1314
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:51,640
Who took my bike? Our person.

1315
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,520
He is right, I gave my bike to one of the boys.

1316
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,080
But I don't know them.

1317
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,120
Why did you give your bike to a random stranger?

1318
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,560
They are my bar friends, sir.

1319
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,720
They were pushing the bar one day.

1320
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:12,160
They asked me to lend a hand. I refused to help.

1321
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,480
'I am in trouble now.'

1322
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:18,120
I asked them permission to push the bar closer to home.

1323
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,760
They nodded in approval.

1324
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,920
I managed to push the bar.

1325
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,440
Only then I realized

1326
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,240
there were four boys inside the bar I pushed.

1327
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,400
Couldn't you get a weirder wacko than this?

1328
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,800
Take him out of my sight! - Okay, Sir.

1329
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:35,560
Do you want some tips? - I will teach you a lesson.

1330
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,920
You are the talk of the town.

1331
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,640
Your photos are put up all over the city.

1332
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:46,960
Read the news. See for yourself.

1333
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,520
This must be that Inspector's strategy.

1334
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,280
To finish us in an encounter.

1335
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:06,680
What are you saying?

1336
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:11,200
Yes. To plan for an encounter

1337
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,760
first, they'll enact a drama as if one of them was killed.

1338
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,800
That's how, they killed our Pazhani.

1339
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,680
They'll target each one of us now.

1340
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,840
That inspector must have killed Pazhani.

1341
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,320
Suddenly in the dark, there was just the sound of a swish of a knife.

1342
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,040
I didn't see his face.

1343
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,560
He is taking revenge on us because we assaulted him.

1344
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,400
Stop the car. Take reverse.

1345
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,080
Look at this poster.

1346
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,200
They are big thieves.

1347
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:39,440
They are the ones who'd come to our house and created trouble.

1348
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,400
Start the car.

1349
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,360
Move. Don't create a scene.

1350
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,080
Get lost!

1351
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:51,120
All are fighting for water. - Hello. How are you?

1352
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,200
I am fine. - How is your family?

1353
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,680
Everyone's doing fine.

1354
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,760
A guy in your area has borrowed money from me and is being elusive!

1355
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,560
Tell us who he is and we will do the needful!

1356
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:02,320
Move from here. - He knows my power, but still, isn't repaying.

1357
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,080
What a pandemonium!

1358
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,920
They always keep fighting for water!

1359
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,240
Forever being a nuisance, wasted wastrel!

1360
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,680
Kill him. Kill him.

1361
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,520
Let's escape, else, we will be booked in a case.

1362
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,960
Do your work. - Okay, go.

1363
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,600
Okay, wait. I will come.

1364
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,360
They cut my ears off.

1365
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,880
Get into the car.

1366
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,880
Hello? - Inspector?

1367
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,080
Yes.

1368
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,560
Who are you?

1369
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:45,420
Kill him.

1370
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:48,580
What did we do? All we did was steal.

1371
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:51,060
You could've put us behind bars.

1372
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:53,540
Why did you kill our friend?

1373
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:56,420
Did I kill your friend? Are you out of your mind?

1374
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:59,580
Why will I kill only one of you?

1375
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:02,420
I've been hunting for all four of you as a gang.

1376
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:04,500
You killed a cop mercilessly.

1377
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:07,540
You'll be killed in an encounter.

1378
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:11,940
What are you waiting for? Kill him just like Pazhani was killed.

1379
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:14,780
Slit his throat!

1380
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,500
I want his family to mourn his death

1381
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:18,620
just the way we did for our dear friend.

1382
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:23,140
Go ahead, kill him. Kill him!

1383
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:02,260
Come on!

1384
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:10,060
Come on! Why will I kill you?

1385
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:12,700
Am I a scumbag like you to kill you with a sickle?

1386
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:14,740
I'm a police man. - Saravana, let him go.

1387
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:19,620
I have a gun and I can easily shoot all of you.

1388
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:27,820
He's not the killer. Let's run. Come. Come on!

1389
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,140
Why did you stop me from killing him?

1390
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:50,820
I would've killed him.

1391
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:53,660
Were you scared of getting caught for killing a police man?

1392
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:55,780
Don't be stupid.

1393
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:59,240
We are handling this stupidly by considering ourselves to be smart.

1394
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:01,280
If we continue to be impulsive, they will kill us!

1395
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:02,960
None of us would remain alive.

1396
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:04,700
How will we avenge our friend's death then?

1397
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:08,580
He is right. Why use a sickle when he has a gun?

1398
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:14,180
I remember that guy's hand very well. He was a left hander.

1399
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,140
That inspector is a right-hander.

1400
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:24,860
He didn't kill Pazhani for sure.

1401
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:27,380
We are inviting trouble and burying ourselves in it.

1402
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:35,500
Tell me. - Saravana..

1403
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:37,620
Come to Poonga Arya Bhavan tomorrow morning.

1404
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:42,820
Come on.

1405
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,340
Tell me. - Should you speak to me in anger?

1406
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,820
Can't you talk to me with a smile?

1407
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:05,260
I'm worried about you. I want you to be with me always.

1408
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:09,340
I want to tell my father about us.

1409
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,740
I don't have the time to talk with you.

1410
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:15,620
The image of Pazhani's death still flashes before my eyes.

1411
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:17,460
I can't think of any happy occasion

1412
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:18,940
when that image comes to my mind.

1413
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:21,860
Please don't disturb me for few days.

1414
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:23,380
Will you always only think of your friend?

1415
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:24,940
Don't you have a life of your own?

1416
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:31,580
I'll change your life.

1417
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:34,700
I'll tell my father to arrange for some business for you.

1418
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:38,700
Did you call me for this? - Saravana!

1419
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:51,860
Father.. Yes, dear. - I need to talk to you.

1420
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,820
Today also, haven't you prepared the food properly?

1421
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:56,780
Yeah! Pick on me!

1422
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:59,060
Ask your daughter what she wants.

1423
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:01,540
What is it, dear? - I'm in love, father.

1424
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:03,420
What did you just say? Are you in love?

1425
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:07,340
I've lost my dignity, pride, prestige!

1426
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,420
Did you hear that?

1427
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:10,380
As soon as she completed her 12th grade, I asked you to marry her off.

1428
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:12,820
This is what you get by sending her to college.

1429
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:15,940
How will I face my brothers?

1430
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:21,780
My daughter is telling something important

1431
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:24,580
and you're lamenting loudly without even letting me listen to it. Go inside.

1432
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:34,900
Who is he?

1433
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:39,860
The one whom our men hit for speaking to me in the temple.

1434
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:43,020
He's actually a good man.

1435
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:45,780
Since the time you were a child

1436
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:47,180
I've given you all that you've asked for.

1437
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:51,740
Be it a particular dress, cycle, school

1438
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:56,540
bike, even car! I even built this house as per your wish.

1439
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:58,900
I'll even buy you a dog.

1440
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:02,180
But if you thought of feeding it from my plate

1441
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:03,940
I'll kill you!

1442
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:06,900
Being an only child, I pampered you.

1443
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:09,100
I sent you to college and you dared to fall in love!

1444
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:12,900
Looks like you want to get married. I'll find a groom for you.

1445
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:15,860
You had better marry the guy I choose for you.

1446
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:19,540
You are forbidden from going to college or any other darn place.

1447
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:28,380
Bala, my daughter shouldn't step out anywhere.

1448
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:29,540
Okay, sir. - Take good care of her.

1449
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:31,380
Okay, sir. - Finish those boys first.

1450
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:32,580
Okay.

1451
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:43,380
Tell me. - Saravana, where are you?

1452
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:44,660
What's the matter?

1453
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:36,940
He can never be reformed!

1454
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:40,460
What? - We're getting married.

1455
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:43,700
Change into this dress. - Why are you so impulsive?

1456
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:45,660
This will only end in disaster.

1457
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:49,380
How can you be so flippant about getting married?

1458
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:50,860
Go home now.

1459
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:54,940
No, Saravana. I'm scared.

1460
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:57,060
I've told my father about us.

1461
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,740
He's looking for a groom for me.

1462
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:00,460
I can't live with anyone else.

1463
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:02,660
All parents tend to be strict

1464
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:04,420
when they know, their child is in love.

1465
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:07,540
They would've built many hopes and dreams on you.

1466
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:08,820
You are their only child.

1467
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:10,980
They'd like to get you married with a lot of grandeur.

1468
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:13,700
You've suddenly given them such a shocking news!

1469
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:15,180
Of course, they'll be seething with anger.

1470
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:18,700
I love you as much as you love me.

1471
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:20,700
I will not abandon you for sure.

1472
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:41,820
Be a little patient. We can talk it over in a calm manner.

1473
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:43,740
I'll marry only you irrespective of whenever it is.

1474
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:46,420
Don't worry. Just leave.

1475
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:49,220
No, I won't go. Tie the wedding chain around my neck

1476
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:50,540
and then, go wherever you want to.

1477
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:54,140
Even if I die tomorrow, it will be as Mrs. Saravanan.

1478
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:56,500
Don't be crazy! Is this the age to die?

1479
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:12,220
Saravana, please change your dress.

1480
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,380
I can't go home now. - Saravana!

1481
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:23,180
Go fast.

1482
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:28,060
Drive faster.

1483
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,420
An auto rickshaw is following us.

1484
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:36,740
Are we armed? - Yes.

1485
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:41,740
Ask our boys to come to our brick kiln.

1486
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:46,940
Why are you following my car?

1487
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:50,020
Had I known, it was you

1488
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:52,180
I'd have stopped the car right there.

1489
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:58,660
Where is your friend who keeps prancing like a catfish?

1490
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:01,060
You!

1491
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:20,500
You killed my friend!

1492
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:32,220
Come, face me.

1493
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:50,060
Why did you kill him?

1494
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:52,860
Speak up!

1495
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:41,020
Sir! Sir! Sir!

1496
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:44,900
Forgive us, we didn't know, what we were doing!

1497
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:47,340
If you want, kill me, but spare my friend. Oh, God!

1498
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:50,380
I'll hack you to pieces.

1499
01:39:18,860 --> 01:39:21,420
I don't belong to a family of back stabbers.

1500
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:23,740
I fight my opponent face to face!

1501
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:26,940
How dare anyone come to my place and cheat me!

1502
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:30,380
Because I kept my word, you walked away alive the other day.

1503
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:32,860
Even now, nothing stops me from killing all of you.

1504
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:39,340
I returned the sacred statue to the temple as if I found it.

1505
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:41,020
In their joy of getting the idol of their Goddess back

1506
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:42,260
the whole village made me preside over the temple festival.

1507
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:45,900
It's because of that gratitude, I'm letting you go now.

1508
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:51,380
You came to attack me just because you thought, I killed your friend.

1509
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:53,860
Now, I like you guys even more!

1510
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:57,500
Why would I kill him?

1511
01:39:58,060 --> 01:40:00,460
You guys were about to lose your lives because of your impulsiveness.

1512
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:34,300
Let go of him.

1513
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:39,460
Come here.

1514
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:48,540
How could you suspect me?

1515
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:50,620
What's your problem?

1516
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:52,620
Do you need my help?

1517
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:54,780
Forgive me, sir.

1518
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:02,740
You're like brothers to me.

1519
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:04,420
If you have any problem

1520
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:06,300
you can approach me anytime.

1521
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:07,980
Let's go.

1522
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:11,900
Start the car.

1523
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:16,580
Go to the nearest hospital.

1524
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:36,380
Saravana!

1525
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:40,300
Saravana!

1526
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:44,300
Why did you come here?

1527
01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:53,220
Why are you tormenting me like this?

1528
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:55,300
What's my mistake?

1529
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:57,820
I was avoiding you in the beginning.

1530
01:41:58,220 --> 01:41:59,860
If you hadn't followed me

1531
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:04,180
I'd have happily married the groom of my parents' choice.

1532
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:09,460
You made me fall in love with you and now, why are you torturing me?

1533
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:15,340
Saravana, leave all this behind. Let's go somewhere and start a new life.

1534
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:17,980
Please, Saravana. - Look..

1535
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:20,260
I have no idea what my future will be.

1536
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:22,820
I'm not even sure if I'll live.

1537
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:26,620
Our only goal now, is to kill the man who killed Pazhani.

1538
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:30,140
We're fighting our enemies totally in the dark.

1539
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:31,900
If I die in this struggle

1540
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:33,940
you get married to a suitable boy.

1541
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:37,540
If I'm alive, I'll definitely marry only you. Leave now.

1542
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:40,140
Marry someone else?

1543
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:42,340
Then, why did you fall in love with me?

1544
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:44,300
Why did you love me?

1545
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:47,660
Why did you love me?

1546
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:51,180
Don't desert me, Saravana.

1547
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:53,900
I can't live without you.

1548
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:56,980
I'll die. - Saravana!

1549
01:42:58,380 --> 01:42:59,420
Let's go.

1550
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:01,700
I have to go now. You leave.

1551
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:03,820
I won't go. Don't leave me.

1552
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:07,100
I'm telling you to leave. - I won't.. Don't go.

1553
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:08,220
Marry me now.

1554
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:10,380
As much as I am important to you

1555
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:12,060
my friends are equally important to me.

1556
01:43:12,260 --> 01:43:14,980
I'll move on with my life only after I kill Pazhani's killer.

1557
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:18,220
If you stop me.. - Saravana! - Get lost!

1558
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:20,060
No, Saravana.

1559
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:22,300
Please, Saravana.

1560
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:24,860
Don't leave me.

1561
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:29,500
I can't live without you.

1562
01:43:31,820 --> 01:43:35,260
What will I do?

1563
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:38,740
Don't abandon me. Please, Saravana.

1564
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:42,860
Forgive me if I've spoken out of turn.

1565
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:44,740
Are you deaf or what?

1566
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:52,980
Saravana, you're going to see me dead!

1567
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:05,420
Here.

1568
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:15,260
This is Rs.5,00,000. Take it.

1569
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:17,500
I'd saved up this money for you.

1570
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:21,700
Take that girl to some far off place

1571
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:24,860
and stay happily. That's enough for us.

1572
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:29,940
Despite her affluent upbringing, she insists, she'll only marry you.

1573
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:31,380
She's the right one for you.

1574
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:33,900
I never thought, her love for you was this intense.

1575
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:36,100
What a girl!

1576
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:40,140
Despite knowing our intentions, she is willing to marry you.

1577
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:43,380
Take her away and get married. Go.

1578
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:47,460
We'll take care of Pazhani's killer.

1579
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:50,580
I am as vexed as you are!

1580
01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:53,580
My heart will be appeased only when I hack that chap to pieces.

1581
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:58,260
I'm still unable to take in his death.

1582
01:44:58,780 --> 01:45:00,820
Is this the time for me to live with her happily?

1583
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:05,580
I can get back my life anytime I want.

1584
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:07,860
I'll never ever get friends like you.

1585
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:12,020
Even if I had a family of my own I'd have never been so happy.

1586
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:14,060
I'm so happy with you guys.

1587
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:16,700
Where will I go without you?

1588
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:18,980
Saravana!

1589
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:08,460
Saravana! He's the lefty who had killed our Pazhani!

1590
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:10,540
He had set up his goons to kill Pazhani.

1591
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:17,820
We have to finish him.

1592
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:19,600
We must execute it cleverly.

1593
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:22,600
You abduct Rajendran while I distract his men.

1594
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:00,140
Senthil!

1595
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:02,940
Hey! Senthil!

1596
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:04,960
What happened to you?

1597
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:06,960
Hey! Senthil..

1598
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:09,600
Hey! Senthil..

1599
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:11,000
Hey!

1600
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,200
Hey!

1601
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:21,200
Hey, Senthil. Tell me how this happened.

1602
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,280
Hey, Senthil..

1603
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:36,140
Hello? - I'm Rajendran speaking.

1604
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:38,140
The thieves you are looking for

1605
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:40,260
are here, killing each other.

1606
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:42,420
Which area? - Narimedu.

1607
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:47,540
Senthil, what happened?

1608
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:51,820
Tell us, please. Hey! Senthil..

1609
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:55,100
Hey! Senthil..

1610
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:01,460
We've made a blunder.

1611
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:05,180
Hey! Senthil. Hey! Senthil..

1612
01:52:05,980 --> 01:52:07,780
Pazhani was killed by..

1613
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,400
Why do you get jealous if I love him?

1614
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:02,560
What's it with you?

1615
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:05,040
You threatened me with a knife.

1616
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:09,480
You are a novice when compared to me.

1617
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:13,120
I was born with a knife in my hand!

1618
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:17,600
You told him not to trust a girl from Madurai.

1619
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:20,280
Girls from Madurai will forsake their lives for love.

1620
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:24,240
They can also take the life of the one who interferes!

1621
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:28,360
Even my parents haven't spoken to me

1622
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:30,680
the way you've degraded me.

1623
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:33,840
If you don't believe in love

1624
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:35,360
go and kill yourself!

1625
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:38,160
Why do you brainwash the one who is in love?

1626
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:41,880
He's so obsessive about his friends!

1627
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:49,000
You stopped him from marrying me.

1628
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:54,780
I'd sent my men to kill you the other day.

1629
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:03,580
But poor Pazhani became the victim.

1630
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:10,660
I thought, I'd forgive you.

1631
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:13,380
But you keep bouncing back like the malefic effects of Saturn!

1632
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:18,860
Goddess Meenakshi protects Madurai.

1633
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:21,580
This Meenakshi here, is there to protect Saravanan!

1634
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:26,180
Who are you to interfere? You orphan!

1635
01:54:27,980 --> 01:54:31,860
I'll kill whoever comes in between my love and me.

1636
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:36,860
You lefty! At least, now, do your job properly.

1637
01:54:52,420 --> 01:54:53,980
What are you saying, Senthil?

1638
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:57,380
I am scared, I'll die. - Oh, no!

1639
01:54:57,660 --> 01:55:01,420
Don't say that, Senthil. - I feel, someone is dragging me.

1640
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:04,620
Saravana! - Get up. - Aarumugam..

1641
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:09,180
Save me.

1642
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:11,140
Hey! Senthil.. - Saravana!

1643
01:55:11,260 --> 01:55:14,140
Don't leave me. Hey! Senthil.

1644
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:17,820
Hey! Senthil!

1645
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:22,260
Senthil!

1646
01:55:23,820 --> 01:55:25,660
Senthil!

1647
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:38,900
Meenakshi!

1648
01:56:49,180 --> 01:56:50,460
Buddy..

1649
01:56:58,940 --> 01:57:00,340
Forgive me.

1650
01:57:04,460 --> 01:57:07,540
I killed her.

1651
01:58:13,180 --> 01:58:14,460
Buddy, police!

1652
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:33,380
Excuse me, your face looks familiar to me.

1653
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:35,100
Do you remember me?

1654
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:50,500
I've seen him somewhere. I'm just not able to recollect.

1655
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:08,500
I want

1656
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:10,660
to live with you.
