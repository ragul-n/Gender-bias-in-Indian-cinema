1
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:12,121
Are you going to Srinagar?
- No, to Ladakh.

2
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:15,687
For the first time?
- Yes. How is the place?

3
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,690
l don't like it.

4
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:52,491
Are you too going to Ladakh?
- Yes. But first l'll go to Srinagar.

5
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:54,999
Will you stay there?
- No.

6
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:58,140
As soon as l reach Srinagar, l'll
take the air force plane for Ladakh.

7
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:49,847
Why are you so sad, Ramsingh?

8
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:55,621
l took leave to marry.

9
00:04:57,627 --> 00:05:00,824
Are you sad due to the wedding, or
on being seperated from your wife?

10
00:05:02,164 --> 00:05:04,632
l did not get married.

11
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:07,925
Did you fight with
the girl's father?

12
00:05:08,638 --> 00:05:14,042
No. l had a fight with the girl.

13
00:05:28,457 --> 00:05:33,451
lt is an ill-omen to meet
the girl before marriage.

14
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:39,329
Why did you come?
- l couldn't resist.

15
00:05:39,802 --> 00:05:45,672
So impatient?
We have all the time after marriage.

16
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,969
l have to leave for duty
immediately after marriage.

17
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:53,346
But, we will be together.
- The wife is not allowed.

18
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:57,346
How long will you be away?
- A year and a half.

19
00:05:58,854 --> 00:06:00,344
What?

20
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:04,683
You could've extended your leave.
- l did.

21
00:06:04,994 --> 00:06:07,929
But due to the priest's delay,
it got wasted.

22
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:12,358
Then, we could've married
only after 1 1/2 years.

23
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:14,501
What?
- None of our parents...

24
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:18,367
were keen on this marriage.
Now, after convincing them...

25
00:06:18,507 --> 00:06:21,374
you are leaving me at their mercy.
l don't want to marry now.

26
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:23,372
This marriage will happen now!
Or not at all!

27
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:24,501
Fine.

28
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:26,245
Think it over.
- l have.

29
00:06:26,415 --> 00:06:28,383
Then l'll leave; never to return.
- All right.

30
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:38,051
Did you call me?
- No.

31
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:43,729
Write to her and
she will calm down.

32
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:33,246
Take it easy. This is Ladakh.
- Yes, sir.

33
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:36,574
l know you are fond of running,
but the oxygen level here is low.

34
00:07:36,786 --> 00:07:40,586
One feels breathless, so take care.
You've come from Srinagar...

35
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,122
and l am going to Srinagar. You came
by plane and l'm going by my jeep.

36
00:07:43,526 --> 00:07:45,790
Are you going, Sir?
- My leave has commenced.

37
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:50,459
l was waiting to introduce to you
my CEO before leaving for Srinagar.

38
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,290
l am expected there.

39
00:09:03,873 --> 00:09:07,274
My heart wants to sing...

40
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:11,535
and abandon these treasures
of the heart

41
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:15,874
My heart wants to sing...

42
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:19,885
to shed the treasure
of the heart

43
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:40,898
One can not mollify love

44
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:46,707
One can not mollify love

45
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:50,314
And l feel bereft

46
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,321
The flame is missing the moth

47
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:58,917
The tears will stop
at the mere sight

48
00:09:59,094 --> 00:10:02,928
One lover will meet another...

49
00:10:03,098 --> 00:10:06,932
to unload the treasure of love

50
00:10:07,436 --> 00:10:11,338
My heart wants to sing to
abandon the treasures of love

51
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,351
On first sight,
she will feel shy

52
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:41,368
She will come forward,
but will hesitate

53
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:45,372
lnspite of the closeness
she will be embarrassed

54
00:10:45,975 --> 00:10:49,376
And then will come nearer

55
00:10:50,212 --> 00:10:53,375
This is not a game

56
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:57,984
Today someone will abandon
the treasure of love

57
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:01,984
My heart wants to spring forth...

58
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:05,787
to unload the treasury of love

59
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:27,006
l will remove strands of
hair falling on her face

60
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:36,423
My desire will be ablaze

61
00:11:37,026 --> 00:11:41,019
The freedom will torture me

62
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:45,027
Where will l find
such peace again?

63
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:49,360
My heart has no other
place to go

64
00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:53,030
Today, someone will shed
the treasure of the heart

65
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:57,042
The heart wants to sing,...

66
00:11:57,713 --> 00:12:01,046
to unload the treasure
of the heart

67
00:12:13,195 --> 00:12:15,390
lf you repeat your mistakes
you will be punished.

68
00:12:16,865 --> 00:12:18,856
Left, right...

69
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:22,392
About turn!

70
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:24,061
Run!

71
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:32,872
Walk fast.

72
00:12:37,986 --> 00:12:40,079
Chest forward,
hands at the side.

73
00:12:41,156 --> 00:12:44,250
About turn.
- l'm tired.

74
00:12:45,127 --> 00:12:49,826
And you want to become a soldier!
Pick up the rifle!

75
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:04,438
March!

76
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:10,813
Hold the rifle upright.
... about turn!

77
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:16,218
l wonder how long he'll take.
- Halt! About turn!

78
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,804
Attention!
l didn't ask you to relax!

79
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,679
Keep the rifle...

80
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:42,139
and walk fast.

81
00:13:43,152 --> 00:13:44,141
Halt.

82
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:49,152
Very good! Are you tired?
- You nearly killed me.

83
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:52,824
Sorry, sir.
l'll give you a reward for it.

84
00:13:53,428 --> 00:13:57,159
This is a medal which is
awarded to brave people.

85
00:13:57,633 --> 00:14:00,158
Am l brave? too?
- Yes. And if after wearing this...

86
00:14:00,502 --> 00:14:02,663
you do an act of cowardice,
l'll take it away.

87
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:04,962
l'll never behave cowardly.
- Bravo!

88
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:09,638
But, will l become an officer?
- Yes, even better than me.

89
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:13,910
Halt! About turn!

90
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:19,977
The Brigadier has sent for you.

91
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:39,499
Daddy! When did you come?
- Get in.

92
00:14:41,944 --> 00:14:43,206
My son!

93
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:09,227
Sir, the Brigadier is on his way.
- Where is he?

94
00:15:09,538 --> 00:15:12,336
With the D.C.P.
- All right.

95
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:31,382
l like this Sonamar camp.

96
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:34,859
l decided to meet Bahadur
before proceeding to Ladakh.

97
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:38,495
Good. Even we got a chance
to meet you.

98
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:42,269
Bahadur, if the Major
grants you permission,...

99
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:45,907
do come to Srinagar on Saturday.
We'll dine together.

100
00:15:49,478 --> 00:15:52,072
l'll go to Ladakh on Sunday
and you can return here.

101
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:57,545
Please write to your mother
she gets worried.

102
00:16:06,295 --> 00:16:09,093
l'll just come, father.
- Don't forget to come on Saturday.

103
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:17,971
Let Bahadur undergo hardships.

104
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:22,304
And don't favour him because
he is the Brigadier's son.

105
00:16:22,678 --> 00:16:25,977
Don't worry. Bahadur is one
of our better officers.

106
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:27,979
We have high expectations
from him.

107
00:16:46,368 --> 00:16:50,634
Why were you standing so long?
- Why not? Am l a coward?

108
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:53,803
Forgive me, you're a better officer
than me.

109
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:55,609
Okay, you're forgiven.

110
00:16:56,745 --> 00:17:01,682
You promised to come to my house.
- We'll go tomorrow.

111
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,512
Promise?
- Sure.

112
00:17:28,243 --> 00:17:29,471
Sonu!

113
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:31,869
That's my sister.

114
00:17:32,514 --> 00:17:33,606
Help!

115
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:39,377
Come quickly, Sonu!

116
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,891
Help!

117
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,122
Hurry up!

118
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:00,130
What happened?

119
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:03,537
A lamb?
lt's going to die!

120
00:19:00,068 --> 00:19:02,935
C'mon... You take too long.

121
00:20:59,788 --> 00:21:01,255
A penny for your thoughts!

122
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:07,586
Won't you tell me? Okay... l'll tell
you what l've been thinking about.

123
00:21:08,597 --> 00:21:13,830
l was thinking that this valley
of Sonawar is so beautiful.

124
00:21:14,703 --> 00:21:17,900
And all its beauty is
captured in your eyes.

125
00:21:19,307 --> 00:21:21,935
After you leave,
this valley too will seem lovely.

126
00:21:22,277 --> 00:21:24,609
Because it's beauty
will follow you.

127
00:21:26,815 --> 00:21:31,616
And then my eyes will look
for you in these mountains.

128
00:21:33,355 --> 00:21:35,346
Now, tell me about your thoughts.

129
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,788
Nothing. Come on.
Mother has sent for you.

130
00:22:13,662 --> 00:22:15,789
Sir, l had mentioned to you
that a small boy...

131
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,524
wants to accompany you to Lamayu.
- Oh yes, where is he?

132
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:22,269
There he is.
- Over there?

133
00:22:24,873 --> 00:22:27,535
Ask him to hurry up.
- How'll he go with out his mother?

134
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:30,804
And she is very old.
- There is the mother too?

135
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:35,674
Actually the boy's sister is sick,
and both were going on horse back.

136
00:22:35,817 --> 00:22:38,684
l said you're a kind man;
you would drop them.

137
00:22:39,688 --> 00:22:43,089
l'm driving a jeep and you
want me to take everyone along?

138
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:46,857
l'm sorry for making a commitment
without your permission, sir.

139
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:50,696
She's terribly ill, sir.
- Okay.

140
00:23:03,478 --> 00:23:04,706
lll, eh?

141
00:23:15,857 --> 00:23:17,051
What happened?

142
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:20,719
l'll undergo even
this for you, Bahadur.

143
00:23:20,895 --> 00:23:22,726
Hurry up!

144
00:23:25,734 --> 00:23:27,531
Are you going to Srinagar today?
- Yes, Sir.

145
00:23:27,736 --> 00:23:29,863
Give my regards to the Brigadier.
- Yes, Sir.

146
00:23:44,753 --> 00:23:46,550
What is your name?
- Sonu.

147
00:23:46,755 --> 00:23:49,883
ls she your sister?
- Yes.

148
00:23:51,926 --> 00:23:53,985
What is your name?
- Anmo.

149
00:23:58,032 --> 00:23:59,363
Nice name!

150
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,762
Are you Ladakhis?
- Yes, but my mother is a Kashmiri.

151
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:08,299
True, and their father
is a Ladakhi.

152
00:24:09,978 --> 00:24:13,573
So you are going to Ladakh?
- Our first halt is at Namalulu.

153
00:24:13,782 --> 00:24:15,579
Our relatives reside there.

154
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:18,909
Then, we'll go to Leh.
We own a house there.

155
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:21,785
Then, we'll proceed
further to Kohran.

156
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:28,456
Shashur is 200 km from Leh and
Kohran is 50 kms from there.

157
00:24:28,797 --> 00:24:30,264
Don't you know?

158
00:24:30,698 --> 00:24:32,461
His paternal grandpa
has a house there.

159
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,934
l thought maternal grand father.
- That is in Sonamvar.

160
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:49,044
You like Leh or Kohran?
- Leh.

161
00:24:49,617 --> 00:24:52,017
l'm asking her.
- She likes both the places.

162
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,820
No? She doesn't like Leh.
Not even Kohran.

163
00:25:03,832 --> 00:25:06,323
She likes Sonamvar now.
Earlier it was not so.

164
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:08,092
But now she likes it.

165
00:25:37,632 --> 00:25:38,656
Wow!

166
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:48,672
Their father also always
halted here.

167
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,044
Where is he?
- ln Leh.

168
00:26:34,689 --> 00:26:39,592
What's up? You seem pretty cheerful
after praying at the temple.

169
00:26:40,061 --> 00:26:42,256
lt is God's grace!
- l see.

170
00:26:46,935 --> 00:26:50,598
Don't you ever talk?
- Only when she fights with me.

171
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:23,961
Thanks a lot, sir!

172
00:27:25,206 --> 00:27:30,473
lnstead, l'm thankful to you for
showing me such a beautiful place.

173
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:37,143
Wasn't a bad journey, l hope?
- No.

174
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:40,512
Very well.

175
00:27:54,802 --> 00:27:56,997
C'mon, Anmo! Hurry up!

176
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:25,295
Hurry up, l say!

177
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,940
When did you arrive, friend?
- l've been transferred here.

178
00:30:16,477 --> 00:30:19,640
Let's begin our parade.
- We'll do it tomorrow.

179
00:30:27,288 --> 00:30:29,813
l am so happy to meet
you all again.

180
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:33,489
And you?
- Me too.

181
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:36,294
How about her?

182
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:38,831
No. She isn't happy.

183
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:41,829
She is! ...Doubly!

184
00:30:54,182 --> 00:30:57,982
l couldn't buy anything.
- Worry not, l'll buy you everything.

185
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,187
First put water in the jeep.
- Does your jeep run on water?

186
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,318
Okay, here l go.

187
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:09,985
Sit down.

188
00:31:23,678 --> 00:31:26,806
You came to Ladakh and my destiny
brought me to Ladakh, too.

189
00:31:27,949 --> 00:31:29,610
Do you know the reason?

190
00:31:30,484 --> 00:31:36,684
Neither do l. Perhaps we are
destined to be together.

191
00:31:39,227 --> 00:31:43,561
Maybe l'm in the army only so
l can be close to you.

192
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:52,435
Maybe we were born to continue our
relationship from our previous birth.

193
00:31:53,975 --> 00:31:58,912
Now my heart longs
to be close to you.

194
00:32:02,383 --> 00:32:05,750
l may go someplace
far away from here,...

195
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,250
and destiny will again
draw you to me.

196
00:32:09,257 --> 00:32:11,521
And then you will always
be with me.

197
00:32:13,327 --> 00:32:18,765
l don't know where you come from
or where you will go.

198
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:24,731
l don't even know if l should
trust you or not.

199
00:32:26,173 --> 00:32:32,476
But, l don't want anything
other than being close to you.

200
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:40,885
l prayed to meet you again.
And God answered my prayers.

201
00:32:42,089 --> 00:32:48,460
l'll go again and pray never
to be separated from you in life.

202
00:32:49,297 --> 00:32:53,700
And if l die, it should
be before we part.

203
00:32:59,173 --> 00:33:02,506
l'll take you to Delhi.

204
00:33:03,044 --> 00:33:04,841
ls it very far?
- Yes.

205
00:33:05,112 --> 00:33:06,977
ls it a very big city?
- Yes.

206
00:33:07,315 --> 00:33:09,806
ls it heavily populated?
- Yes.

207
00:33:10,318 --> 00:33:13,014
Do lights twinkle there?
- Yes.

208
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:15,819
Will you take me?
- Yes.

209
00:33:16,324 --> 00:33:19,589
l'll buy you a lot of
clothes and jewellery.

210
00:33:19,727 --> 00:33:21,319
Will you wear them?
- Yes.

211
00:33:21,595 --> 00:33:24,120
l'll take you to meet my mother.
She is very nice.

212
00:33:24,332 --> 00:33:26,323
Will you meet her?
- Yes.

213
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:32,337
l've already filled water twice
in the jeep. Anything else?

214
00:33:32,673 --> 00:33:34,470
ln fact, we've been
waiting for you!

215
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,820
Sonam, come tomorrow near
that brick shack for the parade.

216
00:34:18,386 --> 00:34:20,911
See you tomorrow.
- Juley.

217
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:23,380
Juley?
What does that mean?

218
00:34:24,058 --> 00:34:27,391
When we greet someone
or part we say 'Juley'.

219
00:34:27,995 --> 00:34:30,395
Well, juley then.

220
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,537
The place you have to go
in 300 kms from here.

221
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:47,675
lt will take you 3 days
by jeep and a day's walk.

222
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:51,643
lt is a difficult journey
and you can start tomorrow.

223
00:34:52,653 --> 00:34:57,647
There are Chinese posts
near our own... on our land.

224
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:01,561
Talks are on between
Delhi and Beijing to remove them.

225
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,421
We only have to
protect our posts.

226
00:35:06,434 --> 00:35:09,767
Sir, the boy l trained
in Sonamvar,...

227
00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:12,105
l spoke of him earlier.
- Oh yes!

228
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,240
He's coming here tomorrow and
he's fond of parade.

229
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:18,435
l'll explain everything to him.
- Thank you!

230
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,645
You will leave tomorrow morning
to command Post No 3.

231
00:35:24,185 --> 00:35:27,882
l'll follow you and be at a distance
of 5 miles at Post No 1.

232
00:35:47,975 --> 00:35:51,467
Did you write to mother?
- Yes, l'll mail the letter today.

233
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:15,191
What is it?
- Wait, l am coming.

234
00:36:16,203 --> 00:36:18,797
l'm leaving!
That place isn't for girls.

235
00:36:19,507 --> 00:36:23,170
Wait for me, l too am coming!
- Hurry up then!

236
00:36:52,606 --> 00:36:56,133
Go on, but don't
say l'm here.

237
00:37:07,755 --> 00:37:10,553
Has that boy come?

238
00:37:18,699 --> 00:37:20,564
Sir's calling you.

239
00:37:48,862 --> 00:37:53,390
Bahadur's gone very far, they say.
He'll surely return...

240
00:37:53,734 --> 00:37:55,395
but no one knows when.

241
00:38:22,296 --> 00:38:23,285
Attention!

242
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:26,891
About turn!

243
00:38:34,308 --> 00:38:35,297
Relax.

244
00:38:41,915 --> 00:38:44,816
When did you come to Leh?
- A couple of days ago.

245
00:38:47,721 --> 00:38:52,658
Where are you going, Major?
- l'm going very far.

246
00:38:52,993 --> 00:38:55,962
And my friend, Bahadur?
- He's with me, too.

247
00:38:56,664 --> 00:38:59,929
When will he come?
- l don't know.

248
00:39:00,801 --> 00:39:02,996
But l'll ask him to meet you
when he returns.

249
00:39:04,672 --> 00:39:06,196
Give him my love.

250
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:29,312
Everything is all right, Sir.
- Okay, you may go.

251
00:40:38,966 --> 00:40:40,957
Dear son, may God bless you

252
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:45,762
l guessed from your letter that
Ladakh is a ruined paradise,...

253
00:40:45,906 --> 00:40:49,899
which a beautiful Ladakhi girl
has brought to life

254
00:40:50,577 --> 00:40:53,444
lf my son is so fond of her,
l am ready to accept her...

255
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,946
as my daughter-in-law.
All l want is to see you happy

256
00:40:56,683 --> 00:40:59,447
Didn't l say that my mother
is very nice?

257
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:03,017
She has accepted you as her
daughter-in-law.

258
00:41:58,645 --> 00:42:05,244
l have to hear foot-steps,...

259
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,249
and my heart wonders...

260
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:17,262
if it's him

261
00:42:19,066 --> 00:42:22,866
l wonder if it could be him

262
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:05,908
Hidden in the depths
of my heart,...

263
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:17,915
From the depths of my heart,
as if someone were calling out...

264
00:43:18,926 --> 00:43:26,924
and lights the cockles
of my heart

265
00:43:27,734 --> 00:43:31,329
This is his style

266
00:43:36,743 --> 00:43:40,941
l wonder if it is him

267
00:44:03,203 --> 00:44:08,368
l see his handsome
face everywhere

268
00:44:18,618 --> 00:44:23,385
Every fibre of my being
is tuned...

269
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:35,391
to his touch which is
like a whisper

270
00:44:36,169 --> 00:44:39,400
l wonder if it is him

271
00:44:49,516 --> 00:44:54,010
l have to hear footsteps
and l wonder...

272
00:44:54,521 --> 00:45:01,427
l wonder if it is him

273
00:45:14,174 --> 00:45:18,543
Chinese and lndians are brothers!

274
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:24,847
Go away from our land.
Chinese and lndians are brothers!

275
00:45:34,861 --> 00:45:38,388
We don't want to fight with you.
But if you don't go away...

276
00:45:38,565 --> 00:45:43,059
we'll slaughter you.
Chinese and lndians are brothers.

277
00:45:45,138 --> 00:45:48,073
Leave our land and go away.

278
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:52,072
We don't want to fight you.
But if you don't go away...

279
00:45:52,245 --> 00:45:56,739
you'll be slaughtered like lambs!
Chinese and lndians are brothers.

280
00:45:57,484 --> 00:46:02,319
They are forcing a bond on us.
- Very emphatically too!

281
00:46:02,823 --> 00:46:05,883
They think the conqueror
Chengiz Khan...

282
00:46:06,093 --> 00:46:09,085
has left the entire land
for them in his wake.

283
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,900
l'm fed up with their
slogans of brotherhood.

284
00:46:17,104 --> 00:46:20,301
l wonder where the government
has placed me!

285
00:46:21,108 --> 00:46:24,908
You are a new recruit.
Who enrolled you in the army?

286
00:46:26,113 --> 00:46:31,107
l own acres of land.
My elder brothers are in the army.

287
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:36,681
And l tilled the land.
One evening when l returned home...

288
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:41,854
Sister-in-law, today your
son too has tilled the land.

289
00:46:46,233 --> 00:46:48,701
Both my sisters-in-law
are very nice.

290
00:46:48,835 --> 00:46:52,271
l always wondered at the difference
between you. And realised it today.

291
00:46:52,806 --> 00:46:59,143
The elder one is sweet and the
younger one is impish.

292
00:47:10,157 --> 00:47:13,354
Will you ever tease me?
- Never!

293
00:47:14,628 --> 00:47:16,152
She's bitter!

294
00:47:17,164 --> 00:47:19,155
Enough!

295
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:22,829
She's a sweet-meat!

296
00:47:28,675 --> 00:47:33,442
Hit him for teasing you.
Go on...

297
00:47:45,992 --> 00:47:52,192
Before your father died, he wanted
you to join the army at the age of 18.

298
00:47:52,632 --> 00:47:55,601
Now that you are 18,
you must go.

299
00:47:56,403 --> 00:47:59,338
The army? He too?

300
00:48:02,008 --> 00:48:04,408
lsn't it enough that two of
your sons are already there?

301
00:48:05,212 --> 00:48:07,874
This poor child has not seen
his father since two years.

302
00:48:09,216 --> 00:48:14,483
And she's seen her husband
only twice since marriage.

303
00:48:15,222 --> 00:48:17,019
And when he marries,
like us,...

304
00:48:17,224 --> 00:48:20,421
his wife too will anxiously
wait to see her husband.

305
00:48:24,364 --> 00:48:29,233
And you haven't seen your
sons since 2 years.

306
00:48:30,103 --> 00:48:33,095
Don't send him away.
The family will be lonely.

307
00:48:33,506 --> 00:48:36,907
He's still a kid.
- l'm no kid! l will go!

308
00:48:39,012 --> 00:48:42,038
He will go.
Take the 5 'O clock train tomorrow.

309
00:49:09,409 --> 00:49:11,070
Give this to my husband.

310
00:49:15,982 --> 00:49:18,075
And this to him.
- Sweetmeats?

311
00:49:19,586 --> 00:49:21,952
Good-bye, mom.
- Bless you.

312
00:49:36,036 --> 00:49:41,531
Here is the sweetmeat and
here's that photograph.

313
00:49:43,043 --> 00:49:45,102
Today, l am sending both
of it to them.

314
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,070
My elder brothers are 50 kms
away from here.

315
00:50:03,263 --> 00:50:06,790
l wrote many letters but
received no replies.

316
00:50:08,335 --> 00:50:11,327
Everyone here is ridiculing me.

317
00:50:12,806 --> 00:50:15,138
Atleast write once.

318
00:50:17,344 --> 00:50:23,544
l hope l receive your letter
when the mail arrives next.

319
00:50:25,352 --> 00:50:26,944
Hurry up and come!

320
00:50:44,371 --> 00:50:46,362
Well? Have you
received your letter?

321
00:50:47,574 --> 00:50:49,974
Well?
- Don't pester him!

322
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,369
Water.

323
00:51:30,183 --> 00:51:31,946
You'll get your letter tomorrow.

324
00:51:38,525 --> 00:51:40,618
Watch out.
- Sure.

325
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:49,863
The mail has arrived!

326
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,768
See how he's running! l wonder
if he'll receive his letter.

327
00:51:57,177 --> 00:51:59,771
He hasn't received one in
6 weeks, but today he will.

328
00:51:59,913 --> 00:52:03,144
l don't think so.
- He will.

329
00:52:03,683 --> 00:52:06,117
Let's wager for Rs. 5
- Okay.

330
00:52:06,453 --> 00:52:08,944
l'm going to recover
5 bucks from you today.

331
00:52:09,189 --> 00:52:10,656
So let's go.

332
00:54:18,217 --> 00:54:25,988
l left her doorstep thinking,...

333
00:54:26,759 --> 00:54:34,598
she would breakdown
and pacify me

334
00:54:43,743 --> 00:54:51,013
The breeze gently blew her veil

335
00:54:51,784 --> 00:54:59,623
l thought she will hold my
hand and cajole me

336
00:55:08,801 --> 00:55:16,037
Her feet moved so slowly....

337
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:24,045
as though she would
call me back

338
00:55:29,088 --> 00:55:36,051
But neither did she stop me
nor did she pacify me

339
00:55:36,929 --> 00:55:44,062
Nor did she hold my hand,
nor did she cajole me

340
00:55:45,138 --> 00:55:52,067
She did not call out to me...
nor did she call me back

341
00:55:52,845 --> 00:56:00,684
l slowly moved ahead

342
00:56:01,354 --> 00:56:08,692
and finally got
separated from her

343
00:56:09,228 --> 00:56:16,100
l finally got
separated from her

344
00:56:17,637 --> 00:56:24,702
l got separated from her

345
00:56:45,765 --> 00:56:49,360
lt's really sad that
no one writes to him.

346
00:56:49,902 --> 00:56:56,000
He is waiting only for one letter
but in vain. Anyway, l won my bet.

347
00:56:56,776 --> 00:57:01,236
Aren't you ashamed to gamble
on his condition?

348
00:57:01,514 --> 00:57:05,450
On the first of every month
he wagers bets and wins.

349
00:57:05,785 --> 00:57:12,452
And then lends that money to us
on interest. He's really ruined me.

350
00:57:16,796 --> 00:57:19,128
He must receive his letter.

351
00:57:20,566 --> 00:57:24,798
l'm very lucky to have received
my son's photograph today.

352
00:57:26,706 --> 00:57:31,268
He is so very cute.
- He must be grown up now.

353
00:57:33,446 --> 00:57:35,471
My younger brother too has
joined the army.

354
00:57:35,615 --> 00:57:38,812
Two of you in the army?
- The third one too.

355
00:57:41,821 --> 00:57:46,019
He is posted in Ladakh.
80 miles frome here.

356
00:57:56,836 --> 00:57:59,828
The mail is here..
Hurry up!

357
00:58:11,584 --> 00:58:13,313
l miss you a lot

358
00:58:13,452 --> 00:58:17,650
l've told my wife not to write
romantic stuff on a postcard.

359
00:58:18,858 --> 00:58:20,485
The postman must be
reading all this.

360
00:58:21,627 --> 00:58:23,254
l'm knitting a sweater for you

361
00:58:24,463 --> 00:58:26,192
To, Cook Chaturam...
lt must he from my wife.

362
00:58:29,602 --> 00:58:31,934
My dearest Chaturam

363
00:58:33,272 --> 00:58:35,263
You are embarrassing me, Parvati.

364
00:58:36,008 --> 00:58:38,875
Why did you become a cook?

365
00:58:40,112 --> 00:58:44,446
l am sending you a recipe
for tandoori chicken.

366
00:58:44,884 --> 00:58:46,374
Well done, my wife!

367
00:58:47,687 --> 00:58:51,418
l've got the recipe
for tandoori chicken.

368
00:58:51,891 --> 00:58:55,383
Today, l'll feed you
Tandoori chicken!

369
00:58:55,895 --> 00:59:00,059
Rubbish! Where'll you get
a tandoor from?

370
00:59:04,637 --> 00:59:08,095
l've received sweets.
- Sweets!

371
00:59:15,314 --> 00:59:17,305
Sweets!

372
00:59:19,919 --> 00:59:22,581
Hang on guys... relax.
- First the sweets.

373
00:59:23,055 --> 00:59:26,149
Wars are very unpredictable.
Come on, let's eat it.

374
00:59:44,143 --> 00:59:46,441
Vir Singh! lnstead of sweets
you've received soil.

375
00:59:58,658 --> 01:00:02,287
l'll use it to wash the vessels!

376
01:00:05,164 --> 01:00:08,190
What is this, feller?

377
01:00:12,104 --> 01:00:15,198
Come, l'll read out
a part of the letter.

378
01:00:15,775 --> 01:00:18,539
l've heard there
is no greenery there

379
01:00:18,744 --> 01:00:22,578
l'm sending the soil of the
plant you so lovingly grew

380
01:00:22,982 --> 01:00:25,450
And also the seeds of
the flowers you like

381
01:00:26,786 --> 01:00:29,277
When the flowers grow,
do remember me

382
01:00:41,734 --> 01:00:42,996
Well said.

383
01:00:45,004 --> 01:00:51,500
You have written that you
always remember me as a bride

384
01:01:03,789 --> 01:01:07,350
When you return,
l'll deck up as a bride

385
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:13,327
But don't repeat what you did 3 days
after our marriage

386
01:01:36,055 --> 01:01:38,114
What if l leave tomorrow?

387
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,546
Not now ... no!

388
01:02:38,918 --> 01:02:40,783
ls everything okay?
- Yes, Sir.

389
01:02:48,627 --> 01:02:51,721
l received a letter from mother.
She's great!

390
01:02:52,264 --> 01:02:54,129
First she enrolled me
in the military...

391
01:02:54,266 --> 01:02:56,860
and now wants me to take
leave to come home... to get engaged.

392
01:02:57,136 --> 01:03:01,539
Everyone's leave is cancelled.

393
01:03:03,142 --> 01:03:06,942
Chinese and lndians
are brothers!

394
01:03:08,147 --> 01:03:10,138
Not again!

395
01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:13,814
All day, all night!

396
01:03:14,887 --> 01:03:17,481
lt's become difficult to stay here.
- What is all this?

397
01:03:18,157 --> 01:03:25,620
We are at loggerheads
with each other.

398
01:03:26,165 --> 01:03:30,693
We both are fighting for
ownership of the land.

399
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:35,163
lf the land is really ours,
why are they claiming ownership?

400
01:03:36,475 --> 01:03:39,842
And that too for a barren land.

401
01:03:40,346 --> 01:03:44,840
So what? But the country is ours!
- So where is our border then?

402
01:03:45,351 --> 01:03:49,981
lt means we are trespassing.
- They are here, we too are here.

403
01:03:50,189 --> 01:03:52,180
Tell me, whom does it belong to?

404
01:03:52,658 --> 01:03:54,387
Can l ask you a question?

405
01:04:01,433 --> 01:04:04,596
Have you ever heard of Hindustan
attacking another nation?

406
01:04:05,337 --> 01:04:06,531
No, sir.

407
01:04:07,406 --> 01:04:11,866
Was there a tyrant ever
born in our country?

408
01:04:13,212 --> 01:04:16,545
Has our country ever tried
to conquer another nation?

409
01:04:18,217 --> 01:04:21,550
Then, will we break
our age old tradition,...

410
01:04:21,954 --> 01:04:24,752
to seize someone's
barren land,...

411
01:04:26,358 --> 01:04:31,694
when we don't even have
our army and congas.

412
01:04:32,364 --> 01:04:38,030
Our leaders have always advocated
peace, and to protect the nation.

413
01:04:40,172 --> 01:04:47,704
But what do their leaders advocate,
who are endorsing brotherhood?

414
01:04:51,717 --> 01:04:53,708
This is a book written
by their leader.

415
01:04:55,254 --> 01:05:03,593
And it says that those who don't
conform to us are not our friends

416
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,830
And those who are not our
friends are our enemies

417
01:05:06,999 --> 01:05:11,936
And their forces will rest only
after killing their enemies

418
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:18,568
We don't consider anyone our foe, they
don't consider anyone their friend.

419
01:05:20,279 --> 01:05:22,873
We were recommending them
to the world.

420
01:05:23,282 --> 01:05:28,845
While they were quietly building
army posts on our land.

421
01:05:30,422 --> 01:05:34,552
The Chinese army wants to
gain control over Asia.

422
01:05:34,893 --> 01:05:38,829
And wants to ruin
the world's peace.

423
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,794
They are pawns
who are moving ahead.

424
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:49,598
They move forth with precision;
to check-mate us.

425
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:59,115
And it is our duty
to foil their motives.

426
01:06:02,421 --> 01:06:05,481
We have orders not to open fire.
And we will not.

427
01:06:07,059 --> 01:06:11,655
But we must never forget...

428
01:06:12,131 --> 01:06:16,329
that these Chinese don't
have honourable intentions.

429
01:06:18,137 --> 01:06:21,800
And they are standing on our land.
And are asking us to leave!

430
01:07:24,636 --> 01:07:27,628
Beware soldiers!

431
01:07:58,937 --> 01:08:00,632
Answer my signals.

432
01:08:16,455 --> 01:08:21,051
Send a message not to open fire
till they start firing.

433
01:08:32,471 --> 01:08:36,271
We have orders that we must
not fire till the Chinese don't.

434
01:08:53,392 --> 01:08:56,793
There is nothing to fear,
brave soldiers.

435
01:08:57,496 --> 01:08:59,657
Don't fire till you receive orders.
Understand?

436
01:09:06,505 --> 01:09:09,303
We're just 25 of us...
and they aren't less than 300.

437
01:09:09,508 --> 01:09:11,499
Ask them to get 300 more.

438
01:10:13,138 --> 01:10:16,369
Their intentions don't look good.
- Nor their luck.

439
01:10:16,775 --> 01:10:19,767
We won't begin firing and give
them a chance to launch an attack.

440
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:21,910
No firing!

441
01:10:22,648 --> 01:10:25,378
Each of us has to kill
atleast 20 of them, sardar.

442
01:10:25,717 --> 01:10:29,118
Just twenty?
Wait for it to begin, buddy!

443
01:10:59,351 --> 01:11:02,286
They are at a distance
of 50 yards from us.

444
01:11:02,621 --> 01:11:03,815
No firing.

445
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:06,180
No firing!

446
01:11:17,803 --> 01:11:20,897
This one l'm gonna get!
- Whom?

447
01:11:21,373 --> 01:11:27,243
That bloody lizard!
- They all look the same.

448
01:11:51,103 --> 01:11:52,536
What the hell is going on?

449
01:11:52,671 --> 01:11:55,139
Neither are they fighting nor,
are they letting us fight.

450
01:11:55,374 --> 01:11:57,001
l could blow them up!
- Don't you dare!

451
01:11:57,142 --> 01:11:59,667
We won't start the firing.
Get it?

452
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:09,485
25 yards!
- No firing.

453
01:12:10,022 --> 01:12:11,182
No firing!

454
01:12:28,073 --> 01:12:31,372
Chinese and lndians
are brothers!

455
01:12:34,713 --> 01:12:36,510
Chinese and lndians
are brothers!

456
01:12:36,882 --> 01:12:40,318
l never knew that!

457
01:12:40,786 --> 01:12:43,118
This is our land!
Go away!

458
01:12:43,288 --> 01:12:47,725
Your men mustn't step here...
we're brothers, after all.

459
01:12:50,729 --> 01:12:51,957
Well said!

460
01:12:54,066 --> 01:12:55,727
Chinese and lndians are brothers!

461
01:12:58,804 --> 01:13:03,468
We will not leave the post.
We are there to protect our borders.

462
01:13:04,409 --> 01:13:07,344
We don't want a fight but
we will not vacate the booth.

463
01:13:08,747 --> 01:13:10,977
Do what you deem fit.

464
01:13:13,552 --> 01:13:16,350
Send a message to the Head
Quarters. Go ahead and write.

465
01:13:20,258 --> 01:13:22,556
The Chinese commander
has told our commander...

466
01:13:22,761 --> 01:13:26,925
that our soldiers can come out
of the post, but can't retract.

467
01:13:27,766 --> 01:13:31,258
But we are not vacating the booth.

468
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:34,762
All food items will be sent
by helicopter.

469
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:39,269
Arrangements are made to give
Ladhaki civilians rifle training.

470
01:13:49,988 --> 01:13:51,114
Aim... fire!

471
01:13:57,696 --> 01:14:01,132
What's up, Ram Swaroop?
- l want to present this to you, sir.

472
01:14:01,533 --> 01:14:02,966
The first flower.

473
01:14:04,836 --> 01:14:08,067
lt's beautiful.

474
01:14:08,807 --> 01:14:11,799
Though it has not blossomed fully,
it is a flower nonetheless.

475
01:14:15,213 --> 01:14:18,307
Your wife so lovingly sent
the seeds to you.

476
01:14:18,817 --> 01:14:21,479
You must keep the first flower.
lsn't it?

477
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:24,812
Sir...
- Thanks a lot anyway.

478
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:36,824
Our government is holding talks
with the Chinese government.

479
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:43,134
They may move away in a few days.
But we have to be cautious.

480
01:14:45,577 --> 01:14:51,914
So, most of you will accompany
me to Post No 2.

481
01:14:52,851 --> 01:14:54,842
There we will be given
more soldiers.

482
01:14:54,986 --> 01:14:59,184
So that if the Chinese act
smart, we can help this post.

483
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:04,852
ln my absence, you will be
the commander of this post.

484
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:08,021
lf there is any problem,
handle it carefully.

485
01:15:08,533 --> 01:15:12,025
Rest assured, sir. Each of our
soldier is equal to 20 of them.

486
01:15:13,538 --> 01:15:14,869
l know that.

487
01:15:15,874 --> 01:15:17,637
l may return in a few days.

488
01:15:18,977 --> 01:15:21,207
Then we'll celebrate Diwali together.
- Yes, Sir.

489
01:15:58,283 --> 01:16:00,717
We're here, right now.
And we've come from here.

490
01:16:01,052 --> 01:16:04,044
This is the Chinese post
where they are holed up.

491
01:16:05,156 --> 01:16:07,147
Captain Bahadur Singh
is here right now.

492
01:16:08,093 --> 01:16:09,924
You have to go and inform him...

493
01:16:10,061 --> 01:16:13,929
to come in from behind the Chinese
and to set up his position.

494
01:16:14,065 --> 01:16:16,431
So that our men who are
surrounded can get some relief.

495
01:16:16,801 --> 01:16:18,928
You must be there and at the
first given opportunity...

496
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:21,402
we'll send more soldiers.
- Yes, Sir.

497
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:23,139
Any more questions?
- No, Sir.

498
01:16:23,441 --> 01:16:25,272
Go on. Good luck.

499
01:17:08,987 --> 01:17:11,854
The place from where we
heard those brotherly slogans...

500
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:16,324
are now shelling us, sir!
l can't see the enemy!

501
01:17:17,996 --> 01:17:21,557
Nain Singh, l regret
for not being with you.

502
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,992
l consider myself unfortunate!
- Don't worry, Sir.

503
01:17:25,337 --> 01:17:27,237
Every soldier is fighting fit.

504
01:17:27,639 --> 01:17:31,336
Bravo, Nain Singh! Keep it up!
l'll talk to you later.

505
01:17:31,476 --> 01:17:33,137
Get me head quarters immediately.

506
01:18:09,614 --> 01:18:12,708
The enemy is bombing many
posts simultaneously.

507
01:18:13,051 --> 01:18:16,384
lt is impossible to rush help
from one post to another.

508
01:18:16,788 --> 01:18:19,279
Resist the enemy
as far as possible.

509
01:18:20,058 --> 01:18:24,256
And if you have to leave your booth,
move back and set up another post.

510
01:19:42,207 --> 01:19:44,471
What's the position now?

511
01:19:45,944 --> 01:19:48,811
Smoke and dust has
impaired visibility, sir.

512
01:19:53,251 --> 01:19:56,345
Hold on, sir...
l can see something!

513
01:20:00,024 --> 01:20:01,889
The Chinese troops
are approaching!

514
01:20:18,009 --> 01:20:19,636
This is an attack, sir!

515
01:20:20,979 --> 01:20:22,844
They're approaching us
from this side, too.

516
01:20:26,117 --> 01:20:28,108
They are approaching us
from all sides.

517
01:20:28,586 --> 01:20:31,487
They are more than a thousand!
- A thousand?

518
01:20:34,526 --> 01:20:38,189
Nain Singh! Quit that
post immediately.

519
01:20:39,597 --> 01:20:42,191
lmpossible, sir!
We had promised you,...

520
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:44,858
that our each of our soldiers
will kill atleast 20.

521
01:20:45,003 --> 01:20:48,370
l assure you, every soldier
will fulfill his promise.

522
01:20:48,673 --> 01:20:51,699
Nain Singh, you will
leave that post.

523
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:55,873
Sir, we may not meet for Diwali.

524
01:20:56,814 --> 01:20:59,942
Wish everyone a happy Diwali
on our behalf.

525
01:21:23,241 --> 01:21:25,471
Take this to Captain Bahadur Singh
immediately.

526
01:21:31,249 --> 01:21:32,375
Hurry up!

527
01:22:01,312 --> 01:22:03,439
There, they are coming
over the mountains.

528
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:30,104
Each one has to kill atleast 20.
- You bet!

529
01:24:34,667 --> 01:24:37,636
There's a message for you.
- What's wrong with you?

530
01:24:38,071 --> 01:24:40,005
l was attacked on the way.
- What?

531
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,935
The attack has commenced.

532
01:24:44,844 --> 01:24:47,438
We are immediately
summoned at the post. Hurry up!

533
01:25:07,467 --> 01:25:10,959
They are too many.
- They are coming to you for a shave.

534
01:25:11,871 --> 01:25:13,964
Let them come,
l won't spare them!

535
01:25:36,429 --> 01:25:38,021
More are coming to die.

536
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:01,634
Leave the post.

537
01:28:58,931 --> 01:29:00,694
They are coming from all sides.

538
01:29:18,151 --> 01:29:19,709
Leave the booth.

539
01:29:34,734 --> 01:29:39,933
There is one remaining.
- Forget it. Come!

540
01:33:27,233 --> 01:33:30,964
Didn't l tell you that
we will kill your people at random?

541
01:33:31,537 --> 01:33:33,630
lt's you who've been
killed indiscrimately.

542
01:33:33,773 --> 01:33:35,968
The entire battle field is strewn
with dead bodies of your soldiers.

543
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,665
Sonam, wait here for me.

544
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:46,705
This is the only way
and time to escape.

545
01:34:47,446 --> 01:34:50,279
And you follow me one
after the other. Carefully!

546
01:35:08,868 --> 01:35:13,532
The enemies modus operandi is
to first do extensive bombing.

547
01:35:14,073 --> 01:35:18,066
Then it surrounds the posts
and then attacks.

548
01:35:23,015 --> 01:35:26,314
They have started here too.
lt's the turn of Post No. 3 now.

549
01:35:32,591 --> 01:35:37,085
We won't fight here.
We will surrender this position.

550
01:35:37,797 --> 01:35:44,100
We will meet them here
... and then we'll see.

551
01:36:26,145 --> 01:36:27,806
Hasn't Bahadur come?
- No, Sir.

552
01:41:03,822 --> 01:41:05,653
Bahadur hasn't come yet?
- No, Sir.

553
01:41:08,193 --> 01:41:09,820
l am worried about him.

554
01:41:13,432 --> 01:41:16,731
You had your fill,
now let me.

555
01:41:20,439 --> 01:41:23,875
Chinese and lndians
are brothers!

556
01:41:42,127 --> 01:41:46,461
Congratulations
on your victory!

557
01:41:48,834 --> 01:41:51,132
But l won't permit you
to stay there.

558
01:41:51,303 --> 01:41:55,740
But Sir, each of our solders equals
20 of them. And we've proved it.

559
01:41:56,675 --> 01:42:01,874
lf we are allowed to counter attack,
l'm sure we can retrieve post no 1.

560
01:42:02,414 --> 01:42:06,282
But l've information that the enemy
is surrounding you from all sides.

561
01:42:08,487 --> 01:42:10,478
Sir, l am waiting
for captain Bahadur singh.

562
01:42:10,656 --> 01:42:13,648
l had sent him a message
to meet me here.

563
01:42:14,426 --> 01:42:17,918
Bahadur hasn't come yet?
Hasn't he sent a message too?

564
01:42:22,668 --> 01:42:24,499
There is some information.

565
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:35,310
l've received news that the
enemy is closing in on you.

566
01:42:36,215 --> 01:42:39,184
They are around 2000 in number.
Leave that place at the earliest.

567
01:42:39,685 --> 01:42:44,019
Sir, Bahadur has only a handful
of soldiers. How can l leave him?

568
01:42:44,523 --> 01:42:48,323
We can not risk so
many lives for one man.

569
01:42:49,528 --> 01:42:52,190
Tiger, you will leave immediately
or you will be ruined.

570
01:42:53,298 --> 01:42:56,529
There is only one
escape route now,...

571
01:43:00,339 --> 01:43:03,035
from behind the mountains.

572
01:43:03,942 --> 01:43:06,206
Hurry up.
That is an order.

573
01:43:09,715 --> 01:43:12,809
There is a canal behind the
mountains. What shall l do?

574
01:43:14,553 --> 01:43:18,785
How can l leave Bahadur Singh behind?
l can take on the enemy.

575
01:43:24,563 --> 01:43:26,554
Why l am l being asked
to leave this place?

576
01:45:00,659 --> 01:45:04,652
ls everything all right?
- l'm fine, but not he.

577
01:45:06,365 --> 01:45:08,458
Today l'll give you a chance
to win the bet.

578
01:45:08,667 --> 01:45:10,828
Tell me if the bullet
hit me or no not?

579
01:45:11,069 --> 01:45:14,334
You will lose.
- Then you win.

580
01:45:14,673 --> 01:45:17,335
Okay, you aren't hurt.
So, give me Rs.20.

581
01:45:31,690 --> 01:45:36,024
How long will you walk?
We are walking like dead bodies.

582
01:45:37,829 --> 01:45:42,027
We have lost our way.

583
01:45:43,935 --> 01:45:47,962
No one's talking!

584
01:45:50,776 --> 01:45:55,372
No one is answering anything;
answer me!

585
01:45:57,949 --> 01:46:02,215
There is a death like stillness...

586
01:46:03,722 --> 01:46:07,522
with only a few comrades.
- You need rest, Vir Singh.

587
01:46:07,926 --> 01:46:10,724
All of us have been starving
for the last 3 days, and are tired.

588
01:46:10,862 --> 01:46:12,523
You are not the only one.

589
01:46:13,732 --> 01:46:18,396
Did l feed you all so that
you get fed up within 2 days?

590
01:46:18,904 --> 01:46:22,340
l am not complaining
about starving.

591
01:46:22,474 --> 01:46:28,071
l want to know why are
we retreating like cowards?

592
01:46:29,481 --> 01:46:32,041
Why can't we die on
the battlefield?

593
01:46:32,617 --> 01:46:35,051
ls this death better
or that one?

594
01:46:38,824 --> 01:46:41,452
No one has any answers.

595
01:46:43,895 --> 01:46:48,491
Calm down, Vir Singh.
You are an lndian soldier.

596
01:46:50,235 --> 01:46:53,568
l am a lndian soldier
and a Rajput too.

597
01:46:53,905 --> 01:46:59,343
My father too was in the military.
How will l face him when l return?

598
01:46:59,911 --> 01:47:04,007
What will l tell him
when he asks me,...

599
01:47:04,516 --> 01:47:07,576
why did l return alive
from the war?

600
01:47:07,986 --> 01:47:12,446
And what will Hukum Singh
answer his brave father?

601
01:47:12,924 --> 01:47:17,452
Will he say that he's a coward?!
- l don't want to hear that word!

602
01:47:17,929 --> 01:47:19,794
Who says you are a coward?

603
01:47:21,099 --> 01:47:23,465
Before asking me,
ask yourself.

604
01:47:23,802 --> 01:47:26,396
lf you don't want to look within,
l'll do it for you.

605
01:47:28,373 --> 01:47:30,568
Did you fight like a coward?
- No.

606
01:47:30,942 --> 01:47:35,311
Didn't every of our soldier kill 50
of the enemy before he succumbed?

607
01:47:35,881 --> 01:47:38,679
lsn't it true that our hands
were numb with firing...

608
01:47:38,817 --> 01:47:41,012
yet we didn't stop,
but the bullets were over?

609
01:47:42,954 --> 01:47:46,617
That the enemy soldiers were
multiplying in number?

610
01:47:47,092 --> 01:47:48,116
Yes.

611
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:54,160
The enemy used 300-500 troops
to kill 30 of our men.

612
01:47:56,301 --> 01:47:59,031
lt means the enemy's strong
point was its strength.

613
01:47:59,638 --> 01:48:03,005
So, shouldn't we try to
weaken this strength?

614
01:48:03,475 --> 01:48:04,339
Yes.

615
01:48:04,509 --> 01:48:08,843
So, our duty lies in our every
soldier killing 20 of them,...

616
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:13,076
and also in protecting his own life,
so that we can kill more of them.

617
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:16,911
So, it was not done to die
at the hands of the enemy...

618
01:48:17,055 --> 01:48:18,579
due to lack of the bullets.

619
01:48:19,858 --> 01:48:23,350
You are experieced soldiers,
well versed with the enemy's tactics.

620
01:48:23,862 --> 01:48:25,625
The nation needs you.

621
01:48:25,864 --> 01:48:28,856
lt is not cowardice to protect
oneself whilst killing the enemy.

622
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,161
None of you have run away
from the battle.

623
01:48:32,871 --> 01:48:36,363
The war has not ended.
ln fact, it has just begun.

624
01:48:37,209 --> 01:48:42,545
We have to increase our strength. And
throw out the enemy from our land!

625
01:48:42,147 --> 01:48:45,082
We are here!

626
01:48:45,617 --> 01:48:47,608
Here!

627
01:49:07,138 --> 01:49:10,505
They neither see nor hear us.
ls the wireless fixed yet?

628
01:49:10,976 --> 01:49:15,572
No. Their voice reaches us but
our voice is not reaching them.

629
01:49:17,148 --> 01:49:19,241
May be there are looking
out for us.

630
01:49:21,853 --> 01:49:23,514
Sir, there is some sound.

631
01:49:24,856 --> 01:49:29,850
There is no news from
Major Ranjit Singh.

632
01:49:30,862 --> 01:49:32,853
Their wireless too is off.

633
01:49:33,231 --> 01:49:39,932
They were given orders
to leave their booth.

634
01:49:40,605 --> 01:49:45,542
But, apparently they have not
obeyed the command.

635
01:49:46,011 --> 01:49:50,345
The enemy had surrounded
them completely.

636
01:49:50,682 --> 01:49:57,679
lt is not possible for any of our
soldiers to have escaped alive.

637
01:49:58,156 --> 01:50:03,025
Looks like they've been killed.
- What nonsense?

638
01:50:03,895 --> 01:50:07,023
Repair it and tell them
we have obeyed the orders!

639
01:50:07,165 --> 01:50:10,896
Tell him that we could
have vanquished the enemy.

640
01:50:11,036 --> 01:50:15,496
We are still fit and our soldiers
are ready to fight unto death.

641
01:50:19,811 --> 01:50:27,081
They think we're dead!
No one will even try to find us.

642
01:50:29,621 --> 01:50:32,488
News will be sent to
their houses that... No!

643
01:52:00,678 --> 01:52:05,411
Only out of helplessness...

644
01:52:07,185 --> 01:52:14,421
must she have forgotten me

645
01:52:15,527 --> 01:52:23,024
Only due to helplessness,
must she have forgotten me

646
01:52:23,334 --> 01:52:30,433
She must have swallowed
the bitter pill painfully

647
01:52:31,042 --> 01:52:38,039
Only out of helplessness
must she have forgotten me

648
01:52:59,571 --> 01:53:05,476
Her heart must have
reminded her of past incidents

649
01:53:10,582 --> 01:53:17,078
Her heart must have relived
better incidents

650
01:53:18,089 --> 01:53:24,494
And she must have wept
unshed tears

651
01:53:25,597 --> 01:53:32,093
She must have burnt my
letter behind closed doors

652
01:53:32,504 --> 01:53:39,501
Her heart must have been shattered
and lay there on the floor

653
01:53:40,111 --> 01:53:47,108
Only out of helplessness,
must she have forgotten me

654
01:54:04,802 --> 01:54:11,139
She must have tried to
steer clear out of fear...

655
01:54:15,813 --> 01:54:22,150
She must have tried
to stir out of fear...

656
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:29,555
and seen her world
crumble around her

657
01:54:30,461 --> 01:54:37,162
And when she must've moved
my photograph from the table...

658
01:54:38,169 --> 01:54:48,170
When she must've removed my
photograph from the table...

659
01:54:55,820 --> 01:55:02,589
she must've imagined me
writhing in pain

660
01:55:03,494 --> 01:55:09,592
Out of sheer helplessness,
must she have forgotten me

661
01:55:27,785 --> 01:55:34,213
Her desires must
have been unfulfilled...

662
01:55:45,903 --> 01:55:52,638
And she must've smiled
through her tears

663
01:55:53,544 --> 01:56:00,643
At the mention of my name
she must've shed tears...

664
01:56:02,253 --> 01:56:11,651
At the mention of my name,
she must've shed tears...

665
01:56:17,268 --> 01:56:24,674
and wept unconsolably on
her friend's shoulders

666
01:56:25,276 --> 01:56:32,682
Out of sheer helplessness,
must she have forgotten me

667
01:56:53,404 --> 01:56:59,707
When someone must've compelled
to brush her hair,...

668
01:57:11,656 --> 01:57:18,323
her face must have mirrored
her anguish

669
01:57:18,629 --> 01:57:25,330
She must be tortured by pain

670
01:57:26,270 --> 01:57:33,335
The colour must have
drained out of her face

671
01:57:33,845 --> 01:57:40,683
Only out of helplessness
must she have forgotten me

672
01:57:41,018 --> 01:57:47,753
And must've quietly
swallowed the bitter pill

673
01:57:47,859 --> 01:57:52,762
Only out of helplessness,...

674
01:58:45,416 --> 01:58:46,644
Go away...

675
01:58:48,419 --> 01:58:51,650
Go on!
- No.

676
01:59:11,442 --> 01:59:12,773
Go away, l say!

677
01:59:52,783 --> 02:00:00,747
Neither did she stop me
nor mollify me

678
02:00:01,225 --> 02:00:08,495
Neither did she hold me
nor cajole me

679
02:00:09,233 --> 02:00:16,503
Neither did she call out to me
nor call me back

680
02:00:17,008 --> 02:00:24,710
l moved ahead slowly

681
02:00:25,316 --> 02:00:32,654
So much so that l got
separated from her

682
02:00:33,524 --> 02:00:40,521
And finally got separated from her

683
02:01:55,373 --> 02:02:00,743
Sir, we're tired;
we can't move any further.

684
02:02:02,413 --> 02:02:05,348
l know; let's rest for a while.

685
02:02:16,627 --> 02:02:18,618
This road will surely lead
to a hamlet.

686
02:02:21,399 --> 02:02:26,359
This is the last journey.
- The soldiers have lost heart.

687
02:02:27,238 --> 02:02:31,140
How is that possible?
- They won't go any further.

688
02:02:58,869 --> 02:03:01,929
How long can we go on
like this?

689
02:03:03,240 --> 02:03:04,867
Let's not talk now.

690
02:03:28,599 --> 02:03:29,691
Listen...

691
02:03:31,001 --> 02:03:32,832
this is the last lap.

692
02:03:35,639 --> 02:03:37,436
l hope it's not the end.

693
02:03:37,842 --> 02:03:40,436
There is a last segment
everyday.

694
02:03:40,911 --> 02:03:43,709
lt is better to kill one self.

695
02:03:47,718 --> 02:03:49,447
Are you soldiers or corpses?

696
02:03:52,890 --> 02:03:55,518
lt would've been better
had we been corpses.

697
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:59,523
True. Atleast l wouldn't have to
hear this answer.

698
02:04:01,465 --> 02:04:06,164
l am ashamed for
being your officer.

699
02:04:08,139 --> 02:04:12,303
What will you do if the
enemy challenges you?

700
02:04:13,444 --> 02:04:16,413
Will you accord him a
welcome?

701
02:04:17,515 --> 02:04:20,746
Won't you fight him?
- We will fight.

702
02:04:21,418 --> 02:04:23,886
Yes, we will fight.
- Till our last breath.

703
02:04:25,089 --> 02:04:32,860
You are ready to fight the enemy,...
but you don't want to live...

704
02:04:33,430 --> 02:04:38,766
for your family,
friends and the regiment.

705
02:04:40,704 --> 02:04:42,763
For them we are
already dead.

706
02:04:46,777 --> 02:04:50,975
Diwali is round the corner.

707
02:04:52,983 --> 02:04:58,785
We've lost track of dates,
but it must be around.

708
02:05:01,392 --> 02:05:09,299
Just think, when they will
know that you are alive...

709
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:16,797
they will be elated and
will give you a joyous welcome.

710
02:05:22,813 --> 02:05:25,976
l am elder to all of you.

711
02:05:27,618 --> 02:05:31,418
And now, l am like an elder
brother to you, not your officer.

712
02:05:32,823 --> 02:05:38,125
Like yours, my feet too are sore.
But l will walk ahead.

713
02:05:40,564 --> 02:05:42,327
And l will say,...

714
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:48,065
that will-power is
what keeps us moving.

715
02:05:52,443 --> 02:05:55,003
Shame on you, guys!
Let's go.

716
02:07:27,671 --> 02:07:29,730
What is it?
- Some injured soldiers have arrived!

717
02:07:30,074 --> 02:07:34,340
We must arrange help for them.
- Hurry up!

718
02:07:34,611 --> 02:07:36,272
l am going to find out.

719
02:07:36,747 --> 02:07:39,944
Perhaps Captain Bahadur Singh
is one of them.

720
02:08:22,593 --> 02:08:24,083
Don't get up.

721
02:08:25,996 --> 02:08:28,658
What are you doing here?
- We have a house here.

722
02:08:28,999 --> 02:08:32,093
Don't you remember?
l mentioned it.

723
02:08:35,139 --> 02:08:36,731
But what are you doing here?

724
02:08:37,074 --> 02:08:41,807
We heard some soldiers have
returned from the battle, and...

725
02:08:42,312 --> 02:08:44,542
So we thought maybe our Captain
Bahadur Singh too is there.

726
02:08:44,715 --> 02:08:46,478
He was with you?

727
02:08:58,262 --> 02:09:02,028
What is the matter?
Please tell me.

728
02:09:03,700 --> 02:09:07,500
This man is coming from there.
Tell her.

729
02:09:08,572 --> 02:09:10,802
There were only 5 men
with the Captain.

730
02:09:11,175 --> 02:09:16,135
The enemy had surrounded them
and seized their position.

731
02:09:17,114 --> 02:09:19,241
There was no possibility
of their escape.

732
02:09:20,050 --> 02:09:21,642
Bahadur is dead!

733
02:09:26,056 --> 02:09:29,048
Bahadur is invincible.
He is lying!

734
02:09:29,193 --> 02:09:32,651
Don't ever say that.
The Major too is lying.

735
02:09:37,868 --> 02:09:40,666
Why did he speak all this?

736
02:09:49,079 --> 02:09:51,411
That Major is lying.
- Address him respectfully.

737
02:09:53,217 --> 02:09:55,082
Major sahib is lying!

738
02:09:57,087 --> 02:10:00,887
Bahadur will be all right.
- Yes, he will be all right.

739
02:10:03,093 --> 02:10:04,754
Go on home.

740
02:10:15,105 --> 02:10:16,902
That Major is lying.

741
02:10:30,154 --> 02:10:34,784
l will take you to my city.
l'll buy you jewellery and clothes.

742
02:10:34,925 --> 02:10:37,450
Will you wear it?
- Yes.

743
02:10:37,794 --> 02:10:40,126
And l'll take you to my mother.
She's very nice.

744
02:10:40,264 --> 02:10:42,289
Would you like to meet her?
- Yes.

745
02:10:43,467 --> 02:10:48,530
His handsome face haunts me

746
02:10:52,142 --> 02:10:57,546
lt sets off a passion
in my heart

747
02:11:00,651 --> 02:11:09,150
What feeling is this
that touches my being...?

748
02:11:09,459 --> 02:11:19,562
Could it be him...?

749
02:11:22,673 --> 02:11:30,170
l hear footsteps
and l wonder...

750
02:11:31,481 --> 02:11:34,575
if it could be him

751
02:11:51,301 --> 02:11:55,601
How shall l break this news
to the Brigadier?

752
02:12:01,144 --> 02:12:03,874
Post No. 3 at Kopran is vacant.
Go and occupy it.

753
02:12:04,915 --> 02:12:06,906
l'll send more troops
as soon as possible.

754
02:12:07,951 --> 02:12:10,215
There is no wireless there,
so be careful.

755
02:12:24,234 --> 02:12:26,896
There is news, sir.
- What is it?

756
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:31,701
About Captain Bahadur Singh.

757
02:12:34,745 --> 02:12:37,236
Speak up.
- He died in the war.

758
02:12:41,251 --> 02:12:42,582
l heard it.

759
02:12:48,992 --> 02:12:50,721
Today is Diwali?
- Yes, Sir.

760
02:12:53,063 --> 02:12:54,587
Great gift!

761
02:12:55,432 --> 02:12:59,266
Sir, you wanted to address the
soldiers on Diwali day.

762
02:13:00,003 --> 02:13:05,407
Shall l send the message?
- l will surely address them.

763
02:13:08,011 --> 02:13:09,444
You may go.

764
02:13:58,128 --> 02:14:03,327
The Festival of Lights
is here again...

765
02:14:03,633 --> 02:14:08,730
smeared in blood

766
02:14:16,146 --> 02:14:26,750
Our world is plunged in darkness;
how can we light lamps?

767
02:14:28,024 --> 02:14:33,360
The Festival of Lights
is here again...

768
02:14:52,182 --> 02:14:57,381
Children yearn for sparklers...

769
02:14:58,054 --> 02:15:01,785
and the walls for lamps

770
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:15,404
When a mother is bereft
of her sons,...

771
02:15:15,705 --> 02:15:20,404
how will she decorate her house?

772
02:15:27,918 --> 02:15:31,820
Let the light seek
those paths...

773
02:15:33,423 --> 02:15:38,827
where lies happiness

774
02:15:57,981 --> 02:16:07,447
He was the one who
lit up my nights

775
02:16:15,465 --> 02:16:25,864
He was the one who could
lighten my heart

776
02:16:33,783 --> 02:16:39,483
All he has left behind
is dark nights

777
02:16:39,990 --> 02:16:44,893
He has taken away
the light with him

778
02:16:45,495 --> 02:16:50,899
The Festival of Lights
is here again

779
02:17:10,020 --> 02:17:14,923
How many tears will we shed?

780
02:17:15,825 --> 02:17:20,922
How long will we shed tears?

781
02:17:27,537 --> 02:17:37,936
Tears teach me
many a lesson

782
02:17:45,822 --> 02:17:50,953
There is mourning everywhere

783
02:17:57,968 --> 02:18:02,905
The Festival of Lights
is here again

784
02:18:03,573 --> 02:18:08,977
lt comes smeared with blood

785
02:18:09,779 --> 02:18:14,978
Our world is plunged
in darkness...

786
02:18:15,585 --> 02:18:20,579
how can we light lamps?

787
02:18:21,591 --> 02:18:26,585
The Festival of Lights
is here again

788
02:18:32,736 --> 02:18:38,231
Happy Diwali to you soldiers,
who fought valiantly.

789
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:49,616
May you have the strength to bear
your sorrows, perils and bruises!

790
02:18:51,621 --> 02:18:56,820
People in your country have
sympathies for you...

791
02:18:57,894 --> 02:19:01,022
and have not lit lamps
to celebrate the festival.

792
02:19:01,865 --> 02:19:09,203
This is an unprecedented Diwali.

793
02:19:11,241 --> 02:19:13,072
This is a black Diwali.

794
02:19:13,777 --> 02:19:18,510
And commands not to pray the
Goddess of prosperity...

795
02:19:18,782 --> 02:19:20,773
but the Goddess of Valour.

796
02:19:22,652 --> 02:19:27,646
Once again Diwali will
come and lamps will be lit.

797
02:19:32,462 --> 02:19:37,399
But only on the condition,
that you sacrifice your blood.

798
02:19:38,968 --> 02:19:43,337
The blood of martyrs always
brings results.

799
02:19:45,675 --> 02:19:50,112
A friend has stabbed
us in the back.

800
02:19:51,147 --> 02:19:55,174
When he visited our
country as a guest,...

801
02:19:55,685 --> 02:19:57,676
we gave him a warm welcome.

802
02:19:58,421 --> 02:20:02,084
And accorded him respect
in every meeting.

803
02:20:03,560 --> 02:20:07,690
Every leader and artiste
celebrated his visit.

804
02:20:14,704 --> 02:20:19,300
We were happy to see him
pay homage to the angel of peace.

805
02:20:20,143 --> 02:20:24,705
We even asked him to award
prizes to our soldiers.

806
02:20:26,015 --> 02:20:31,180
But today he sends his forces to shed
the blood of those very soldiers.

807
02:20:33,223 --> 02:20:34,986
A friend did this!

808
02:20:35,859 --> 02:20:39,522
And for a moment we were
devastated.

809
02:20:41,731 --> 02:20:43,722
But now we are once again
in control.

810
02:20:44,868 --> 02:20:49,237
lf this friend has challenged
us like a foe....

811
02:20:49,739 --> 02:20:53,072
then we accept his challenge.

812
02:20:54,744 --> 02:20:58,737
Now we will never let our
enemy rest in peace.

813
02:20:59,916 --> 02:21:04,478
This is our country! The country
of Buddha, Ashoka, Gandhi and Nehru.

814
02:21:05,622 --> 02:21:10,150
We patronise peace,
but not cowardice.

815
02:21:10,827 --> 02:21:15,764
And if in the name of friendship,
the enemy stabs us in the back...

816
02:21:16,766 --> 02:21:21,294
we will gave him the
treatment he deserves.

817
02:21:39,589 --> 02:21:43,787
Bahadur is so lucky
to die a martyr.

818
02:21:44,594 --> 02:21:47,961
And had he survived, he would
have had a nice girl like you.

819
02:21:53,603 --> 02:21:58,040
You must be missing your wife?
- No.

820
02:21:59,075 --> 02:22:01,805
Why?
- Because l never married.

821
02:22:03,546 --> 02:22:05,537
Or is it that you never
wanted to marry?

822
02:22:09,052 --> 02:22:13,113
lt could not happen.
- Reason?

823
02:22:22,632 --> 02:22:26,068
We are meeting after long.
- You too didn't remember me.

824
02:22:26,970 --> 02:22:29,837
Last week, l had visited your
house but you had gone out.

825
02:22:31,841 --> 02:22:34,969
l spoke to your mother.
- Mother is very fond of you.

826
02:22:36,012 --> 02:22:40,073
And you?
- You've never asked this before.

827
02:22:40,884 --> 02:22:44,513
lt did cross my mind
but couldn't speak up.

828
02:22:44,654 --> 02:22:47,054
l've brought something for you.
- What is it?

829
02:22:48,258 --> 02:22:50,453
Tell me.
- First shut your eyes.

830
02:22:51,928 --> 02:22:54,863
Show me your hand.
Not this, the other one.

831
02:22:57,867 --> 02:23:01,997
You are wearing a beautiful ring.
Who gave it to you?

832
02:23:02,805 --> 02:23:07,003
Major Pratap Singh.
- Congratulations and all the best!

833
02:23:09,979 --> 02:23:13,073
When did you meet Pratap?
- A month ago.

834
02:23:14,117 --> 02:23:20,886
What did you want to give me?
- Nothing! Forget it.

835
02:23:21,791 --> 02:23:26,091
l never realised you
love me so much.

836
02:23:27,897 --> 02:23:29,558
This is life!

837
02:23:32,902 --> 02:23:34,893
l've brought something else
also for you.

838
02:23:36,039 --> 02:23:37,904
lt is so beautiful!

839
02:23:39,475 --> 02:23:41,102
Shall l wear them?

840
02:23:46,683 --> 02:23:49,914
When are you meeting Pratap?
- He's expected here today.

841
02:23:54,924 --> 02:23:56,414
l'll just come.

842
02:24:01,931 --> 02:24:03,922
They look good on you.

843
02:24:26,556 --> 02:24:28,751
Where did you get such
beautiful earrings from?

844
02:24:29,726 --> 02:24:32,695
Tell me or l'll die of jealousy.
- Then get jealous!

845
02:24:40,770 --> 02:24:42,965
l wonder why l've still
retained this ring.

846
02:24:47,176 --> 02:24:50,111
lt is the symbol of my misfortune.
- Show me.

847
02:24:50,847 --> 02:24:52,974
Keep it.
- What will l do with it?

848
02:24:53,516 --> 02:24:55,984
And what will l do with it?
- lt is very beautiful.

849
02:24:56,986 --> 02:25:04,654
Keep it.
Please accept it.

850
02:25:11,067 --> 02:25:14,798
You have gone through a heart break,
l too am unhappy.

851
02:25:16,105 --> 02:25:22,101
l think by being together
we can lessen our grief.

852
02:25:25,748 --> 02:25:29,309
Major, l can't hurt you,
so l don't want to refuse you.

853
02:25:30,153 --> 02:25:37,218
But l request you not to
compel me to accept this ring.

854
02:25:38,761 --> 02:25:42,197
l can't forget him.

855
02:25:52,041 --> 02:25:54,635
This is a very inauspicious ring
which has been rejected twice.

856
02:27:26,135 --> 02:27:29,798
He is our own soldier.
- And as fatigued.

857
02:27:33,943 --> 02:27:38,471
What is your name?
- Sir, you?!

858
02:27:40,183 --> 02:27:45,416
l am talking about Captain
Bahadur Singh. He is alive!

859
02:27:46,155 --> 02:27:48,749
Sir, we've received the message that
Captain Bahadur Singh is alive.

860
02:27:52,295 --> 02:27:54,490
l am Tiger speaking.

861
02:27:55,164 --> 02:27:58,964
Heartiest congratulations!
- Thank you!

862
02:27:59,402 --> 02:28:02,462
l'm sorry to give you
the bad news earlier.

863
02:28:03,439 --> 02:28:06,966
Bahadur has safely reached
Kopran booth no 3.

864
02:28:11,614 --> 02:28:16,381
ls he injured?
- No, but he needs rest.

865
02:28:16,986 --> 02:28:18,977
We have received
the news just now.

866
02:28:19,188 --> 02:28:21,418
Didn't l say Bahadur
is invincible?

867
02:28:23,192 --> 02:28:24,750
Let him rest there.

868
02:28:45,314 --> 02:28:47,009
Sir, there is news.

869
02:28:57,693 --> 02:28:58,887
You can go.

870
02:29:08,037 --> 02:29:10,028
Didn't l tell you the Major
was lying?

871
02:29:18,314 --> 02:29:21,044
l've received news that your
position is at a risk.

872
02:29:21,450 --> 02:29:27,753
ln a few hours, 200 enemy
soldiers will attack you.

873
02:29:28,391 --> 02:29:31,053
And your soldiers are
all injured.

874
02:29:32,795 --> 02:29:37,926
So, it is necessary to stall
the enemy till the morning.

875
02:29:38,467 --> 02:29:42,870
So that you and your soldiers
can be flown by a helicopter.

876
02:29:44,940 --> 02:29:49,536
Because the enemy is approaching
from the route where your post lies.

877
02:29:50,079 --> 02:29:54,277
So, the soldiers on that booth
must stall the enemy.

878
02:29:54,617 --> 02:29:57,415
Sir, only Captain Bahadur singh
is there with one more soldier.

879
02:29:59,355 --> 02:30:02,950
lnform Bahadur.
- Sir, how can 2 men hold 200 ?

880
02:30:03,426 --> 02:30:07,863
lf they don't go, you and your
injured soldiers will perish.

881
02:30:08,531 --> 02:30:13,298
The enemy can be stopped at the
mountain opposite to your booth.

882
02:30:13,669 --> 02:30:16,832
Sir, Bahadur has just escaped
the clutches of death.

883
02:30:18,074 --> 02:30:20,304
l know.
- And you are again sending him here?

884
02:30:20,743 --> 02:30:23,974
You are right.
- Sir, Bahadur is my friend...

885
02:30:24,313 --> 02:30:27,305
and your son.
We are ready to fight unto death.

886
02:30:27,483 --> 02:30:30,975
Permit me to call him here.
We'll combat the enemy here.

887
02:30:42,391 --> 02:30:44,382
Who are you?
- Captain Bahadur Singh's friends.

888
02:30:45,194 --> 02:30:46,593
Do me a favour.

889
02:30:49,165 --> 02:30:51,463
Take this letter to Bahadur singh.

890
02:30:52,601 --> 02:30:55,900
Where?
- Behind that mountain.

891
02:30:56,105 --> 02:30:59,131
Okay.
- lmmediately!

892
02:31:16,158 --> 02:31:19,218
You take the letter.
- Do l have to go alone?

893
02:31:19,528 --> 02:31:23,760
Now you can prove
you are brave.

894
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:27,431
And you?
- l'll wait, to distract the enemy.

895
02:31:27,570 --> 02:31:30,095
Crawl and go.

896
02:31:54,830 --> 02:31:57,458
Aren't you ashamed to fire
at a woman?

897
02:32:36,505 --> 02:32:40,703
You are a Ladakhi and we are Chinese.
Chinese and lndians are brothers.

898
02:32:41,010 --> 02:32:47,074
You work and go to
your village and praise us.

899
02:32:47,583 --> 02:32:52,850
We will reward you.
And you must spy for us.

900
02:32:53,322 --> 02:33:00,319
And we will reward
you another 500 Rupees.

901
02:33:01,530 --> 02:33:05,125
Will you do it?
Won't you speak?

902
02:33:53,382 --> 02:33:54,371
You won't?

903
02:33:58,754 --> 02:33:59,914
You won't, eh?

904
02:35:04,787 --> 02:35:07,449
Sonam, why have you come here?

905
02:35:28,677 --> 02:35:31,669
Today we've received that order
which is every soldier's dream.

906
02:35:33,048 --> 02:35:36,381
We have to leave on a mission.

907
02:35:38,721 --> 02:35:40,188
So, you won't speak?

908
02:36:04,513 --> 02:36:07,778
Sonam, now you go home.
- l won't go.

909
02:36:08,117 --> 02:36:13,612
Why?
- You must obey your elders.

910
02:36:14,123 --> 02:36:15,784
l won't go.
- You will too!

911
02:36:16,125 --> 02:36:18,787
No!
- You won't go?

912
02:36:19,261 --> 02:36:20,285
No!

913
02:36:21,130 --> 02:36:25,123
While giving me this medal, you
had said, that you'll take it away...

914
02:36:25,267 --> 02:36:29,135
if l act cowardly. And now you are
asking me to behave like a coward.

915
02:36:29,371 --> 02:36:31,134
l too know to use a rifle.

916
02:36:33,142 --> 02:36:37,806
You are brave, not a coward. But you
have to take care of your sister.

917
02:36:38,347 --> 02:36:40,815
She is the one who sent me here.
She's no coward either.

918
02:36:40,949 --> 02:36:43,144
She was coming with me but we
were intercepted by the Chinese.

919
02:36:43,285 --> 02:36:46,152
Why did you leave her alone?
- What else could l do?

920
02:36:46,321 --> 02:36:48,289
Where is she?
- Behind the mountains.

921
02:36:49,558 --> 02:36:51,287
Why did you leave her alone?

922
02:39:15,304 --> 02:39:18,569
Go and fetch some more bullets.

923
02:40:38,387 --> 02:40:43,689
What happened?
- Nothing. l'm okay. Carry on.

924
02:41:15,190 --> 02:41:20,423
There are no bullets here.
What shall l do now?

925
02:41:24,433 --> 02:41:26,560
Did he send me here
on a pretext?

926
02:45:07,255 --> 02:45:18,325
We have laid down
our lives, friends...

927
02:45:19,668 --> 02:45:29,475
We now entrust
the nation to you

928
02:45:38,219 --> 02:45:43,816
We have sacrificed
our lives, friends

929
02:45:44,292 --> 02:45:49,491
We now entrust
the nation to you

930
02:46:23,231 --> 02:46:28,191
Our bodies were numbed...

931
02:46:28,737 --> 02:46:33,333
yet we did not falter

932
02:46:33,875 --> 02:46:39,006
We did feel sorrow to behead
ourselves....

933
02:46:39,547 --> 02:46:44,075
yet we did not
let down our nation

934
02:46:44,552 --> 02:46:49,251
We fulfilled our mission

935
02:46:49,758 --> 02:46:54,889
Now, we entrust
the nation to you

936
02:47:28,997 --> 02:47:34,025
There are enough reasons
to live, ...

937
02:47:34,536 --> 02:47:39,303
but one doesn't always get
a chance to lay down his life

938
02:47:39,808 --> 02:47:44,609
To dishonour love and beauty...

939
02:47:45,113 --> 02:47:50,073
the youth that lies in
a pool of blood

940
02:47:50,618 --> 02:47:55,817
Today my nation is bedecked
like a bride

941
02:47:56,324 --> 02:48:00,954
Now, we entrust the
nation to you

942
02:48:34,963 --> 02:48:39,866
May the path of sacrifice
never be barren'

943
02:48:40,201 --> 02:48:45,366
You must always follow
that path

944
02:48:45,874 --> 02:48:50,436
The occasion of
victory is enthralling

945
02:48:50,945 --> 02:48:55,973
Life is embracing death

946
02:48:56,551 --> 02:49:01,215
Be ready to lay your lives

947
02:49:01,723 --> 02:49:06,660
Now we entrust the
nation to you

948
02:49:40,895 --> 02:49:45,923
Fight valiantly for your nation

949
02:49:46,434 --> 02:49:51,167
Let no demon rule our land

950
02:49:51,606 --> 02:49:56,441
Break the hands
that are raised on you

951
02:49:56,945 --> 02:50:01,541
Let them not bring us dishonour

952
02:50:02,116 --> 02:50:06,951
You are the heroes

953
02:50:07,322 --> 02:50:12,555
We now entrust the
nation to you

954
02:50:13,094 --> 02:50:17,622
We have sacrificed
our lives, friends

955
02:50:18,166 --> 02:50:23,194
We now entrust
the nation to you
