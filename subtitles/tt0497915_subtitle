1
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,903
So you have come, brother.
You have come.

2
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,496
You have made great
name in hooliganism.

3
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:50,934
At times tore the enemies,
at other times bit them.

4
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:54,691
You are short to look at.
And your name is Lambuaata.

5
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,945
Hey, shroud lifter leader,
stop singing praises of my name.

6
00:01:00,491 --> 00:01:03,909
Talk business.
The business for which..

7
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,073
...you came here from Delhi,
having had the milk of a cat.

8
00:01:07,194 --> 00:01:10,905
Oh brother, I have come here
to give you 50 lakhs to kill..

9
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,756
...that Bachchu Bhigauna.

10
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:16,588
Hey, he was very special to you.

11
00:01:17,018 --> 00:01:18,519
Your wife used to sleep with his..

12
00:01:18,638 --> 00:01:23,362
...and his wife with you.
There was no problem at all.

13
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:28,304
Oh, a problem has arisen.
He has hired Bulla to kill me.

14
00:01:28,424 --> 00:01:34,218
Bulla! Taking the name
of Bulla you have shaken my skull.

15
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:39,316
You have my blood boil
in announcing such a thing.

16
00:01:39,804 --> 00:01:42,792
I have nourished that
rascal by feeding milk.

17
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:47,038
Now he wants to eat my heart out.

18
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:50,456
What! Previously both of you
used to sleep with the same girl.

19
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:53,443
You used to kiss her from
one side and he from the other side.

20
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:54,947
Now you have had a problem.

21
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:57,468
Because politics
and hooliganism are..

22
00:01:57,587 --> 00:02:00,608
...two illegitimate offspring
of the same father.

23
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:03,831
Wow! What powerful
comments you have made.

24
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,838
Comment as bullets fired from a gun.

25
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,418
Shroud-lifter-politician,
mark my words attentively.

26
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,754
This time the deal
of murder will not..

27
00:02:16,243 --> 00:02:18,118
...be made with notes
but with dead bodies.

28
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:21,145
Before Bachchu Bhigauna,
I will kill..

29
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:24,763
...Bulla and his gangsters
and spread their dead bodies.

30
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:28,513
Your party is in power.
You are the home minister.

31
00:02:28,806 --> 00:02:32,849
The police should not come
in between. You will stop it.

32
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:36,639
Say, do you agree with the deal?
I agree.

33
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:38,500
Now Bulla watch out!

34
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,110
Your men will come to
you begging mercy in my name.

35
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:48,558
And will yell, Bulla..
Bulla.. Bulla..

36
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:57,174
Bulla! Bulla!

37
00:02:58,191 --> 00:03:05,145
Bulla! Bulla!

38
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:10,789
Bulla! Bulla!

39
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,490
Bulla-bhai,
Lambuaata stabbed me in my belly.

40
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:34,210
He said he will stab
Bulla and his brother Chutia.

41
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:40,987
He will not leave his
partner Pote alive either.

42
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,336
Bulla, I will die. Save me.

43
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:59,379
My name is Bulla. I keep it open.

44
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:16,058
My name is Chutia. I am
the nightmare for the Champions.

45
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:20,721
Bully, where is your finger.

46
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:24,373
Bulla-bhai,
now there will be hullabaloo.

47
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:26,014
The police and the government..

48
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:27,968
...will say oh there is hullabaloo.

49
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:31,718
Everyone will say..
Hi Chutia, hi Bulla.

50
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,968
Find, find what it is, Chutia.

51
00:04:34,088 --> 00:04:36,663
Catch, catch what it is, Bulla.

52
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:46,546
My name is Pote who does
not spare even his own father.

53
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,591
The earthquake has already occurred.

54
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:57,415
Every body will know now that
there is going to be a gang-war.

55
00:04:57,826 --> 00:05:05,734
The dead bodies will
drop at a fast rate.

56
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:08,312
My god..

57
00:05:11,182 --> 00:05:15,228
My name is Ibu Hatela.
My mother is a daughter of a witch.

58
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,435
My father is a pupil of a demon.

59
00:05:17,555 --> 00:05:19,115
Would you like a banana?

60
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:23,783
Sir, Lambuaata has torn
a kerchief by killing our men.

61
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:25,463
I will tear his pants..

62
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,866
...and that too from the back,
using my thumb.

63
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:30,170
Brother, let me have this.

64
00:05:31,322 --> 00:05:33,802
Look at this.
I will also hit him from the back.

65
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:37,983
Oh kid, why are you hitting
somebody who is dead?

66
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:40,824
If you are a true man,
hit him who killed him.

67
00:05:40,944 --> 00:05:45,160
Fool! I will be a man by
hitting such dead men, I tell you.

68
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,288
That too from behind.
By putting a thumb.

69
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:50,355
Brother! Brother!
These two dogs are teasing me.

70
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,562
Don't be disappointed, my brother.

71
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:54,564
You will also become a man one day.

72
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,200
And take money to
carry out murder like us.

73
00:05:58,235 --> 00:06:04,211
But before that Lambuaata
must be baked on the pan of death.

74
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:11,736
- Move, move.
- Leave me, leave.

75
00:06:17,637 --> 00:06:20,512
Bulla, this is Lambuaata's brother.
We brought him here.

76
00:06:20,824 --> 00:06:25,714
Hey, don't you know I am
Lambuaata's younger brother Kundan?

77
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:27,137
Shut up,
oh, smart fellow if you are..

78
00:06:27,257 --> 00:06:30,309
...Lambuaata's brother,
we are not any less than him.

79
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:33,339
Got it?
Oh Bulla brother, kill him.

80
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,262
And give his hot blood to
small brother, Chutia to drink.

81
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:37,865
So that he will
have heat in himself.

82
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:41,881
And perhaps his waist will
give shocks instead of having them.

83
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:46,459
My name is Bulla.
And I keep it open.

84
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:50,592
You go to your brother
the way my man..

85
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:55,031
...came running to
me before his death.

86
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:05,046
See, see Bulla, don't kill me?

87
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:22,191
My name is Bulla.
I always keep it open.

88
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:29,908
Kundan.. Kundan, my brother.
What happened?

89
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:32,620
What happened? All this. Yes.

90
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:36,339
- My brother, he..
- But who did it?

91
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:42,371
Oh brother!
Don't die. Don't. Kundan.

92
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,307
My brother, who killed you?

93
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:48,281
Bulla killed me, brother.

94
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:52,104
Oh no! Kundan, you are not to die.

95
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:54,105
You can't die without asking.

96
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:58,635
If you die who I will
have fun with? You remember?

97
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:01,228
When we were young you looked..

98
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:07,228
...more handsome than me.
You used to pick up girls.

99
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:11,695
And I used to have fun.
You are not to die. No!

100
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:14,804
I will not let Bulla live
and I will not let you die.

101
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:18,086
Don't die, my brother. Don't die.

102
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:20,976
I'm falling short of breath,
my brother.

103
00:08:21,096 --> 00:08:25,368
Oh no! Hold your breath,
my brother. Hold your breath.

104
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:26,884
Remember my brother, Kundan?

105
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:29,212
That sex worker, don't you?

106
00:08:29,602 --> 00:08:33,495
Who used to say to you'My
dear handsome Kundan.'

107
00:08:33,615 --> 00:08:40,823
'I will put sandal. I will take
you to London on this airplane.'

108
00:08:40,943 --> 00:08:47,336
Remember? Oh, hey Kundan!
Alas! Kundan has died!

109
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:52,634
My Kundan died, Bulla!

110
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:57,870
Hey Bulla,
I will lay bare your sister.

111
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,370
Alas! My brother has died.

112
00:09:10,553 --> 00:09:16,875
Oh, my god! I thought Bulla's
sister must have been a junk shop.

113
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,468
All her things must
have been torn and broken.

114
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,850
That's why I have got this cart.
But, my God!

115
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,522
Body of Sonali, legs of Ravina.

116
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:28,975
And the eyes of Karishma.

117
00:09:29,095 --> 00:09:31,975
Leave my arms, otherwise my brother,
Bulla will cut off your arms.

118
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:35,006
Tomorrow Bulla will
be offered to God.

119
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:39,271
My name is Lambuaata.
I will slap the rascal to death.

120
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:40,913
Lambuaata, leave me, I tell you.

121
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:45,022
Hey, haven't you seen
Kanti Shah's film'Loha'?

122
00:09:45,142 --> 00:09:46,816
There's one dialogue in it.

123
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:49,504
An umbrella is meant
for unfolding it.

124
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:55,238
A shawl is for putting on.
And a girl is meant for teasing.

125
00:09:56,404 --> 00:10:01,154
Leave me. Leave me.
- How strong she is!

126
00:10:01,274 --> 00:10:07,548
Leave me. Help! - You are scaring
me by your brother Bulla's name?

127
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:12,477
Leave me!
- Hey! - Leave me!

128
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:14,871
No! No!

129
00:10:17,696 --> 00:10:21,946
Brother Bulla, put this on and let's go.
- What happened?

130
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:23,665
Over there in the
village Lambuaata..

131
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:25,320
...is molesting your sister.

132
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:26,305
What rubbish are talking about?

133
00:10:26,424 --> 00:10:27,883
I swear to the witch.

134
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:43,899
Munni! Munni! Munni, my sister
Munni. Munni, my sister Munni.

135
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:49,165
You have died. Lambu has killed you.

136
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:53,509
Turned a matchstick into a pole.

137
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,495
Oh I had so many wishes
for you in my heart.

138
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:03,310
I had seen 300 lads for you.
And all of them so handsome.

139
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:07,310
You would have chosen your
husband whoever you wanted.

140
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:11,639
But you became a dead body.

141
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,437
He will come Munni, you just see.

142
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,269
The flame of your funeral pyre
will definitely bring him to me.

143
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:27,692
And after burning
you I will burn Lambu.

144
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:33,245
Your sister's body
has already been burnt.

145
00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:38,353
Make arrangements
for Lambuaata'a death.

146
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:44,521
He killed my sister by repeatedly
laying her on a push-cart.

147
00:11:45,724 --> 00:11:49,958
Now Bulla will kill him
by throwing him on the ground.

148
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:08,427
Lambuaata, you killed my sister..

149
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:11,163
...in order to take revenge
of your brother's loss.

150
00:12:11,283 --> 00:12:12,413
Was it right?

151
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,368
Those who do illegal business..

152
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:17,743
...the lives of their mother,
sister, daughter is at risk.

153
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:22,993
But it was very bad
of you to rape my sister.

154
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:25,207
It was very bad of you.

155
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,063
I don't think it was wrong.

156
00:12:28,408 --> 00:12:32,688
Bread is for eating.
And a bone is for chewing.

157
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:34,336
Whether one is a
sister of an emperor..

158
00:12:34,456 --> 00:12:40,086
...or daughter of wanderer,
one day she will lose her virginity.

159
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:43,716
Hey, don't forget this Lambu.

160
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:46,076
That a mouse can move its paws..

161
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:48,528
...while sitting on
an hurt elephant's tail.

162
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:53,889
But when the elephant breathes in..

163
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:55,639
...then the mouse goes inside.

164
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:58,294
Yes. And we will make you black.

165
00:12:58,414 --> 00:13:01,014
Similar to that place
of a whore which..

166
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:03,514
...becomes dark because of overuse.

167
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:06,490
And becomes a dirty
abuse of every mouth.

168
00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:09,803
You called me the dirt of nail.

169
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,881
Now we will kill
you by applying oil.

170
00:13:13,303 --> 00:13:16,738
I will take the revenge
of my sister's death.

171
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:19,942
Bulla, don't kill me. You don't.

172
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:24,114
Make me your pimp.
I will keep supplying girls..

173
00:13:24,234 --> 00:13:25,348
...and you keep having fun.

174
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:28,697
I will become a condom
for you to protect you from aids.

175
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:31,166
I will become a towel
and stick around your waist.

176
00:13:31,285 --> 00:13:33,765
Don't kill me.
And if you do want to kill me..

177
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,422
...then peel me off
and make me a eunuch.

178
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:38,577
I will wear a sari and dance.

179
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:42,500
"White, white cheeks..
White, white."

180
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,560
"Don't flirt with me."

181
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,325
Enough of your dance!

182
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:06,532
Bulla, you openly killed Lambuaata.

183
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:09,828
You threw his dead
body in a gutter of Worli.

184
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,224
But you haven't killed
the politician coming from Delhi.

185
00:14:11,344 --> 00:14:15,349
For whom I paid you the money.

186
00:14:15,469 --> 00:14:16,629
Why didn't you kill him?

187
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,849
Hey politician Bachhu-bhai!

188
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:22,893
If you shout,
you too will go up to see Lambuaata.

189
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:25,894
Understood? - Hey, before that
I will set the police behind you.

190
00:14:26,014 --> 00:14:27,294
I will send you all behind bars.

191
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:28,942
What will police do to us?

192
00:14:29,062 --> 00:14:31,374
They'll raid all the places
to find us?

193
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:35,343
But what will they get? Nothing!

194
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,439
Brother, brother one minute.

195
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:41,079
Please don't quarrel
with this black rhino.

196
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,237
Because he is a white sheet
in between the law and us.

197
00:14:45,356 --> 00:14:50,002
If we quarrel with him we will
be dragged to the court. Please!

198
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:52,331
You want the dead body of
the politician from Delhi, do you?

199
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:55,190
Of course. - Easy! Did you
take chili pickle this morning?

200
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:56,309
Now, speak.

201
00:14:56,341 --> 00:15:00,389
Then go. My man,
Kaala Shetty will do this task.

202
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:04,717
When that politician will go
to the Legislative Assembly today.

203
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:20,466
Move. Move back. Move.

204
00:16:03,698 --> 00:16:05,605
Hey! Who are you?

205
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:12,084
I am a hater of crime.
A light for the honest..

206
00:16:13,162 --> 00:16:14,834
...and a flame for the hooligans.

207
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:21,771
I will kill you. For sure.

208
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:28,343
I will see you, you rascal.

209
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:42,317
'This court announces
Kaala Shetty..

210
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:46,192
...life imprisonment
under article 302.'

211
00:16:52,115 --> 00:16:55,100
You are being punished.
But don't worry.

212
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:58,681
I will fight your case
till the Supreme Court.

213
00:16:59,431 --> 00:17:03,336
Oh yes, in the jail
you will get booze to drink.

214
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:07,149
Chicken and mutton to eat.
A TV set to see.

215
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:10,471
Once a month you will
have a girl to enjoy with.

216
00:17:10,592 --> 00:17:14,863
All that is ok.
What about him who has got me in?

217
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:21,732
He will be dealt with too. Soon
I will fix a date for his death.

218
00:17:22,357 --> 00:17:24,581
By having arrested Bulla's
associate, Kaala Shetty.

219
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:26,468
You have done a wonderful job.

220
00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:28,663
You should have been in the police.

221
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:31,115
So what if I don't have
the uniform of the police..

222
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:33,411
...after all I have
done the job of police.

223
00:17:34,005 --> 00:17:40,755
As the saying goes,
something is better than nothing.

224
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:42,787
But Bulla is a dangerous criminal.

225
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:44,973
He will surely encounter with you.

226
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,942
There is certainly
going to be an encounter.

227
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:50,403
Let's see who will get
one better than the other.

228
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:10,653
Hey, smart fellow,
who the hell are you?

229
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:15,278
I am a hero for the poor
and a villain for people like you.

230
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:21,182
My name is Shankar.
I am Gunda No. 1.

231
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:24,168
We are Bullies of this place,
Shankar. Don't mess up your life..

232
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:32,288
...by blabbering too much.
You will be dead if I lift my hand.

233
00:18:32,515 --> 00:18:39,321
If you boast too much I will
humble your pride and finish you.

234
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:47,441
If a person shows off too
much then Bulla does not leave him.

235
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:57,790
Bulla, I will make you wear
a nose-ring worn by the whores.

236
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:04,044
When a drunkard thrashes you,
you'll die and go to heaven.

237
00:19:04,164 --> 00:19:08,685
My brother, kill him.
This man looks dangerous to me.

238
00:19:08,806 --> 00:19:11,120
This is not the rotten
tigers of yours.

239
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,385
He looks like a Bengal tiger.

240
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:18,230
He tears apart the
enemies completely.

241
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,558
- Do kill him. Please kill him.
- No.

242
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,168
We will fix a date for his death..

243
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:28,683
...the way we did it for Lambuaata.

244
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:30,704
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

245
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,860
What is it? Let's go.

246
00:19:41,252 --> 00:19:43,191
Hello, father.
Oh you came back, son.

247
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,097
I am very tired.
Geeta, fetch me a glass of water.

248
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:49,957
My son Geeta has gone to see Ganga.

249
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:53,769
To see Ganga?

250
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:59,410
Hey Geeta,
ask your brother to marry me.

251
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:03,066
I will ask brother
Shanker to marry Ganga.

252
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:05,066
But nothing is going
to happen, Ganga.

253
00:20:05,185 --> 00:20:06,284
Why? Why?

254
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:09,518
Because, till the time
the intoxication of your love..

255
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:12,315
...affects him, he is not
going fall in love with you.

256
00:20:12,565 --> 00:20:14,331
And he won't marry you.

257
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:18,067
Intoxication!
Today Shanker must decide.

258
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:20,553
Whether he likes the
intoxication of alcohol.

259
00:20:20,673 --> 00:20:23,209
Or the intoxication of
my love present in my eyes.

260
00:20:55,135 --> 00:20:57,088
"Intoxication will
make one drunk.."

261
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:59,129
"..this intoxication
does not have any strength."

262
00:20:59,146 --> 00:21:00,947
"Intoxication will
make one drunk.."

263
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:02,987
"..this intoxication
does not have any strength."

264
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,872
"Look into my eyes
it isn't any less here."

265
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:08,873
"Intoxication will
make one drunk.."

266
00:21:08,992 --> 00:21:10,966
"..this intoxication
does not have any strength."

267
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:12,810
"Intoxication will
make one drunk.."

268
00:21:12,931 --> 00:21:14,889
"..this intoxication
does not have any strength."

269
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:18,872
"Look into my eyes
it is more powerful."

270
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:20,825
"Intoxication will
make one drunk.."

271
00:21:20,944 --> 00:21:23,496
"..this intoxication
does not have any strength."

272
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:57,057
"Why do drink putting
yourself at risk.."

273
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:04,837
"..come on, drink the
fire by coming into embrace."

274
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:12,390
"Why do drink putting
yourself at risk.."

275
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:16,436
"..come on, drink the
fire by coming into embrace."

276
00:22:16,557 --> 00:22:20,461
"Don't you think
I have weight in words?"

277
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,429
"Intoxication will
make one drunk.."

278
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,469
"..this intoxication
does not have any strength."

279
00:22:24,518 --> 00:22:26,383
"Intoxication will
make one drunk.."

280
00:22:26,502 --> 00:22:28,975
"..this intoxication
does not have any strength."

281
00:22:36,336 --> 00:22:40,633
"Oh sweet beauty,
tell your immature heart..”"

282
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:48,250
"Oh sweet beauty,
tell your immature heart..”

283
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:52,171
“..never to make a mistake
of falling in love with me."

284
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:56,062
"We are free birds and
we are different from others."

285
00:22:56,182 --> 00:23:00,012
"I do what we please.
I'm the king of my heart."

286
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:02,129
"We are happy-go-lucky."

287
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:04,192
"Wow, happy-go-lucky."

288
00:23:04,313 --> 00:23:07,975
"We are happy-go-lucky.
We don't have any worries.

289
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,068
"Intoxication will
make one drunk..”

290
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:12,109
“..this intoxication
does not have any strength."

291
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,006
"Intoxication will
make one drunk..”

292
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,091
“..this intoxication
does not have any strength."

293
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:20,060
"Look into my eyes
it isn't any less here."

294
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:21,992
"Intoxication will
make one drunk..”

295
00:23:22,113 --> 00:23:24,033
“..this intoxication
does not have any strength."

296
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:25,978
"Intoxication will
make one drunk..”

297
00:23:26,097 --> 00:23:28,024
“..this intoxication
does not have any strength."

298
00:23:28,144 --> 00:23:31,916
"Look into my eyes
it isn't any less here."

299
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:34,824
"Intoxication will
make one drunk..”"

300
00:23:36,871 --> 00:23:41,391
Intoxication will make..
Hey, you are imitating me?

301
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,969
Are you mad or what?
Is father at home, my friend?

302
00:23:45,406 --> 00:23:47,327
He isn't? Very good. I just..

303
00:23:55,472 --> 00:23:57,128
Rascal, are you going
to have me killed?

304
00:23:57,249 --> 00:23:59,644
Come on, get lost.
Get lost from here.

305
00:24:00,597 --> 00:24:04,364
Stupid, mad.
He nearly had me killed, goodness!

306
00:24:05,582 --> 00:24:08,067
Tingu nearly had me killed today.

307
00:24:09,253 --> 00:24:11,858
Well, brother,
you drank again today?

308
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:13,874
Ganga must have got you to drink.

309
00:24:13,993 --> 00:24:17,201
And she must have asked
lovingly you to marry her.

310
00:24:17,451 --> 00:24:20,311
Sit down, my sister. You are right.

311
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,047
Whenever she meets
me she sings the same song.

312
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,828
That she loves me.

313
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,328
Brother, Ganga is very good.
Why don't you marry her.

314
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,547
What the hell are
you talking about?

315
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:35,671
I can't even think of marrying
before you get married.

316
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:37,201
Again you talk of my marriage.

317
00:24:37,321 --> 00:24:39,717
Get me married.
Drive me away from home.

318
00:24:40,811 --> 00:24:43,535
Oh, my sister has got angry.

319
00:24:44,036 --> 00:24:46,802
Brother, you must be tired.
Let me press your feet.

320
00:24:46,922 --> 00:24:49,360
No, no. You have
taken enough care of me.

321
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,233
- Now take rest.
- Why so?

322
00:24:52,155 --> 00:24:56,000
This is because, the house
you will be married into..

323
00:24:56,452 --> 00:24:58,693
...will have of loads of
things to be looked after by you.

324
00:24:59,452 --> 00:25:05,594
I wonder what the boy will
be like whom you will be married to.

325
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:10,310
This is the boy who
wins the heart of beauties.

326
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:12,357
Look, how innocent he is.

327
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:16,794
Do me a favour. Come with me inside.

328
00:25:16,914 --> 00:25:18,514
I want to have a word with you.

329
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:21,265
He is of no use to you, Chutia.

330
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:26,076
He simply persuades beautiful girls.
He marries them.

331
00:25:26,196 --> 00:25:29,052
But he never sleeps with them.
He passes them unto me.

332
00:25:29,173 --> 00:25:30,373
You know what I do, don't you?

333
00:25:30,453 --> 00:25:33,913
Oh sweet Lucky,
ask him to pick up a girl.

334
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,380
A girl like the one
who you gave my brother.

335
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,974
What was her name? Yes Haseena.

336
00:25:38,256 --> 00:25:42,333
My brother makes
sweat day and night.

337
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:54,790
Bulla, I am going to
be mother of your child.

338
00:25:54,911 --> 00:25:58,056
Haseena, drop this child.

339
00:25:58,175 --> 00:26:02,116
And if you don't do so,
I will kill you.

340
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,819
I need. Do something for me as well.

341
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,751
Wow, Bulla brother, wow!
You made Haseena sweat.

342
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:15,283
How you wrestle.
I want do wrestling too.

343
00:26:15,403 --> 00:26:17,017
You can do it.

344
00:26:17,136 --> 00:26:18,985
Talking of wrestling I remembered..

345
00:26:19,105 --> 00:26:22,030
...there is a boxing
competition at the court.

346
00:26:22,577 --> 00:26:28,594
It's fun when a human
fights like a dog for money.

347
00:26:29,344 --> 00:26:32,151
I really have fun.

348
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:08,057
What's going on here?

349
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:10,868
Like every Bulla has
organized a competition.

350
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:15,289
From today we will start a new game.

351
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,160
I used to reward the winner only.

352
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:23,067
From today I will reward
the one dies as well.

353
00:28:23,972 --> 00:28:27,239
The winner will get 1 lakh.

354
00:28:27,358 --> 00:28:31,456
And the prize for the
person dying will be 50000.

355
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,878
Is there anyone who
can knock this black hill?

356
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:41,978
Is there a son of a man who
can fight with the tiger's cub.

357
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:44,681
You stay here.

358
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:51,273
Don't forget complete 1 lakh rupees,
you will get.

359
00:28:51,393 --> 00:28:53,398
'If I were to get 1 lakh rupees..

360
00:28:53,518 --> 00:28:55,115
"..I would get my daughter married."

361
00:28:55,236 --> 00:28:56,960
"No matter if I lose my life."

362
00:28:57,726 --> 00:28:58,804
I will fight.

363
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:09,521
Wait, father.
Don't lose your life for money.

364
00:29:09,522 --> 00:29:12,772
I promise you, you will remain
alive and get the money too.

365
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,195
I am.

366
00:30:24,525 --> 00:30:29,072
How strong.
Brother, he is so tough. So strong.

367
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:36,968
May God give so much
strength in his arms..

368
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:40,296
...that he can fight
every injustice easily.

369
00:30:41,296 --> 00:30:43,939
I got it. Come on, feed me sweets.

370
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,579
And here's my blessings.

371
00:30:54,011 --> 00:30:57,605
Look, he too has come. It
seems even he wants to tie a rakhi.

372
00:30:57,726 --> 00:31:01,871
Do you have cash?
Do you have money?

373
00:31:05,307 --> 00:31:07,807
Wow, you have become a well-to-do.

374
00:31:07,928 --> 00:31:09,995
Come. Let me tie you a rakhi.

375
00:31:12,355 --> 00:31:13,942
The times have changed.

376
00:31:16,105 --> 00:31:17,778
What are you doing?

377
00:31:17,897 --> 00:31:19,610
Raksha Bandhan is over.

378
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:23,095
When did I ask you to
get married today. Just once..

379
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,036
Once you tell me that you love me.

380
00:31:26,156 --> 00:31:30,193
These eyes of mine
will wait for all my life.

381
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:47,367
"The magic of your
eyes has taken effect..”

382
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,353
“..my heart has
become out of control."

383
00:31:55,575 --> 00:31:58,153
"The magic of your
eyes has taken effect..”

384
00:31:58,272 --> 00:32:00,886
“..my heart has
become out of control."

385
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:06,841
"I feel like to have
my life written in your name."

386
00:32:06,961 --> 00:32:09,476
"And so the story goes.."

387
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,750
"And so the story goes.."

388
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:14,484
"I have become yours,
and you have become mine."

389
00:32:14,605 --> 00:32:17,156
"The magic of your
eyes has taken effect..”

390
00:32:17,277 --> 00:32:19,750
“..my heart has
become out of control."

391
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:25,321
"I feel like to have
my life written in your name."

392
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:28,401
"And so the story goes.."

393
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:30,836
"And so the story goes.."

394
00:32:30,957 --> 00:32:33,478
"I have become yours,
and you have become mine."

395
00:32:33,597 --> 00:32:36,149
"The magic of your
eyes has taken effect..”

396
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:38,914
“..my heart has
become out of control."

397
00:33:06,545 --> 00:33:12,374
"It seems your heart has
something to say to my heart."

398
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:22,786
"It seems your heart has
something to say to my heart."

399
00:33:22,905 --> 00:33:27,996
"I have to just say that
I want live with you from now on."

400
00:33:28,116 --> 00:33:35,798
"Oh my sweet heart, I want
to forget myself in your love."

401
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:38,500
"The magic of your
eyes has taken effect..”

402
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:41,376
“..my heart has
become out of control."

403
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:19,652
"May the relationship
of love never breaks."

404
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:30,489
"May the relationship
of love never breaks."

405
00:34:30,608 --> 00:34:35,894
" I am crazy in your love,
now everything seems rosy."

406
00:34:36,014 --> 00:34:43,342
"Oh sweetheart, hide me in
your eyes, don't ever leave me."

407
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:46,170
"The magic of your
eyes has taken effect..”

408
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:48,849
“..my heart has
become out of control."

409
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:54,333
"I feel like to have
my life written in your name."

410
00:34:54,454 --> 00:34:57,475
"And so the story goes.."

411
00:34:57,594 --> 00:34:59,763
"And so the story goes.."

412
00:34:59,884 --> 00:35:02,451
"I have become yours,
and you have become mine."

413
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:05,185
"The magic of your
eyes has taken effect..”

414
00:35:05,306 --> 00:35:07,795
“..my heart has
become out of control."

415
00:35:07,914 --> 00:35:10,596
"The magic of your
eyes has taken effect..”

416
00:35:10,715 --> 00:35:14,346
“..my heart has
become out of control."

417
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:20,565
Oh political magician, our
man Kaala Shetty is rotting in jail.

418
00:35:20,684 --> 00:35:22,143
Get him out.

419
00:35:22,262 --> 00:35:24,860
I will get him out.
What's the hurry?

420
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:29,893
Well, the people of his
area have stopped giving money.

421
00:35:30,012 --> 00:35:31,981
That's why it is so urgent.

422
00:35:32,101 --> 00:35:35,763
That's not a big deal.
Take his area in your control.

423
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:38,826
Bulla, you become
the king of that area.

424
00:35:39,278 --> 00:35:44,344
Yeah, this is the right
time to capture his area.

425
00:35:44,463 --> 00:35:49,233
Naata, you go and attack
Kaala Shetty's area.

426
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:52,369
Drive every shopkeeper
out of their shops and bash them.

427
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:55,494
And if anybody comes
in between hit him as well.

428
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:58,103
Beat them hard, ok?

429
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,226
Please spare me.

430
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:21,011
Who is beating him?
I will put everybody in jail.

431
00:36:21,996 --> 00:36:24,308
Hey, constable, we are Bulla's men.

432
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:25,965
If you try to become over smart..

433
00:36:26,085 --> 00:36:30,266
...I will drag you to the
police station and thrash you.

434
00:36:38,581 --> 00:36:40,751
I will see.

435
00:36:53,715 --> 00:36:57,653
I will see. I will see everybody.

436
00:36:58,938 --> 00:37:00,485
Where are you going?

437
00:37:02,141 --> 00:37:04,516
Move, move.

438
00:37:04,813 --> 00:37:06,188
You try to act smart?

439
00:37:15,248 --> 00:37:18,170
If anybody comes in
between we leave them.

440
00:40:01,516 --> 00:40:03,719
Leave it be my son. Leave him.

441
00:40:04,221 --> 00:40:05,798
The law will deal with him.

442
00:40:08,315 --> 00:40:10,518
The law has grown weak, dad.

443
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:13,253
Now, in order to do away
the hooliganism of theirs..

444
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:15,309
...I have to be a hooligan.

445
00:40:15,965 --> 00:40:20,090
Shanker came in the middle.
He manhandled you.

446
00:40:20,856 --> 00:40:23,418
To be a hooligan
is not a child's play.

447
00:40:23,731 --> 00:40:26,766
You have got to use your
brains along with the dagger.

448
00:40:27,032 --> 00:40:31,000
Go Naata, bring Shanker's sister.

449
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,063
Leave me. Leave me.

450
00:40:39,518 --> 00:40:40,768
Help!

451
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:49,099
Help! Leave me.

452
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:53,647
Leave me.

453
00:40:58,193 --> 00:40:59,302
Leave me.

454
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:02,005
Leave me.

455
00:41:06,153 --> 00:41:07,903
Leave me.

456
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:13,137
Leave me.

457
00:41:14,355 --> 00:41:16,293
Help! Help!

458
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:17,902
Help!

459
00:41:19,105 --> 00:41:22,418
Leave me.

460
00:41:22,538 --> 00:41:24,355
Help!

461
00:41:29,103 --> 00:41:30,978
Help!

462
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,750
Leave me.

463
00:41:35,295 --> 00:41:38,952
Help! Leave me.

464
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:56,257
Seeing a girl,
you're trying to become a hero.

465
00:41:56,378 --> 00:42:00,385
I will not leave you.
I will see you.

466
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:04,447
Where are running away?
See me now if you want.

467
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:06,369
Let him go.

468
00:42:08,228 --> 00:42:09,494
Thank you so much.

469
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:13,135
Mention not. Tell what are
you doing in this deserted place?

470
00:42:13,478 --> 00:42:14,822
I was going to college.

471
00:42:14,943 --> 00:42:16,964
This hooligan lifted
me and brought me here.

472
00:42:17,693 --> 00:42:18,710
Who are you?

473
00:42:19,054 --> 00:42:20,193
My name is Gulshan.

474
00:42:20,507 --> 00:42:23,865
You saved my chastity.
You're very nice.

475
00:42:23,985 --> 00:42:25,429
You too are very beautiful.

476
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,353
"The room of my heart is vacant.."

477
00:43:05,472 --> 00:43:08,211
"..you come and dwell in it."

478
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:14,233
"I will cast some
magical spell on you.."

479
00:43:14,353 --> 00:43:16,858
"..you be spellbound in it."

480
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:23,082
"The room of my heart is vacant.."

481
00:43:23,202 --> 00:43:25,349
"..you come and dwell in it."

482
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:27,505
"I will cast some
magical spell on you.."

483
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:30,505
"..you be spellbound in it."

484
00:44:01,086 --> 00:44:02,916
"They say that youthfulness
comes to one.."

485
00:44:03,036 --> 00:44:05,104
"..who has a mystery."

486
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:07,369
"I cannot get to sleep at night,
suggest me.."

487
00:44:07,489 --> 00:44:09,775
"..how I can live alone."

488
00:44:14,434 --> 00:44:16,215
"They say that youthfulness
comes to one.."

489
00:44:16,335 --> 00:44:18,684
"..who has a mystery."

490
00:44:18,804 --> 00:44:20,668
"I cannot get to sleep at night,
suggest me.."

491
00:44:20,789 --> 00:44:22,872
"..how I can live alone."

492
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,847
"The aroma of yours came my way."

493
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:30,067
"You are in the prime
of your youth.."

494
00:44:30,186 --> 00:44:32,222
"..just as a flower
is in full bloom."

495
00:44:32,342 --> 00:44:34,436
"You are in the prime
of your youth.."

496
00:44:34,556 --> 00:44:36,186
"..just as a flower
is in full bloom."

497
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,467
"The intoxication of your
beauty has got into my head."

498
00:44:38,523 --> 00:44:41,216
"And I am reeling in the
intoxication of your beauty."

499
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,273
"The intoxication of your
beauty has got into my head."

500
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,977
"And I am reeling in the
intoxication of your beauty."

501
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:56,190
"The room of my heart is vacant.."

502
00:44:56,311 --> 00:44:58,300
"..you come and dwell in it."

503
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,566
"I will cast some
magical spell on you.."

504
00:45:00,686 --> 00:45:03,566
"..you be spellbound in it."

505
00:45:29,751 --> 00:45:31,907
"This beloved of
yours waits for you.."

506
00:45:32,027 --> 00:45:33,923
"..opening the windows."

507
00:45:34,043 --> 00:45:38,292
"come to me with
some token of love."

508
00:45:43,043 --> 00:45:45,182
"This beloved of
yours waits for you.."

509
00:45:45,302 --> 00:45:47,364
"..opening the windows."

510
00:45:47,483 --> 00:45:51,755
"come to me with
some token of love."

511
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:56,411
"Let it be dark,
then see my sweetheart."

512
00:45:56,532 --> 00:46:00,896
"I will bring my heart for you,
you just see, oh queen."

513
00:46:01,016 --> 00:46:04,802
"I will bring my heart for you,
you just see, oh queen."

514
00:46:04,922 --> 00:46:06,973
"Quietly, you come o, darling."

515
00:46:07,094 --> 00:46:09,537
"Don't you knock the latch."

516
00:46:13,661 --> 00:46:15,911
"Quietly, you come o, darling."

517
00:46:16,032 --> 00:46:18,635
"Don't you knock the latch."

518
00:46:22,432 --> 00:46:24,760
"I will cast some
magical spell on you.."

519
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,974
"..you be spellbound in it."

520
00:46:27,094 --> 00:46:29,178
"The room of my heart is vacant.."

521
00:46:29,298 --> 00:46:32,443
"..you come and dwell in it."

522
00:46:50,134 --> 00:46:51,603
Wow Gulshan! Wow!

523
00:46:52,806 --> 00:46:55,383
You did manage to trap Geeta
with your charms after all!

524
00:46:55,503 --> 00:46:58,742
You have managed to enter
the empty room of her heart.

525
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:02,994
Now you will marry her..
But my younger brother, Chutiya..

526
00:47:03,114 --> 00:47:05,072
...will honeymoon with her!

527
00:47:05,192 --> 00:47:10,010
Brother.. how is that possible?
I am like that cylinder of gas..

528
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:12,041
...which is totally empty.

529
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:14,587
How will there be
any fire from the gas?

530
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:16,776
How will I celebrate my honeymoon?

531
00:47:16,896 --> 00:47:18,323
You will celebrate!

532
00:47:19,353 --> 00:47:21,745
This pill will raise
the fire within you.

533
00:47:22,557 --> 00:47:25,793
Then you'll tear her blouse.
Oh!

534
00:47:26,581 --> 00:47:30,066
You go and bring her
bridal palanquin here fast.

535
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:03,535
"Having become an outsider,
today my sister.."

536
00:48:03,655 --> 00:48:08,941
"..goes to her husband's abode."

537
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:16,749
"Having become an outsider,
today my sister.."

538
00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:21,655
"..goes to her husband's abode."

539
00:48:23,438 --> 00:48:29,844
"Being afar and alone,
her brother cries.."

540
00:48:29,965 --> 00:48:36,079
"Being afar and alone,
her brother cries.."

541
00:48:36,501 --> 00:48:43,179
"..his heart is deeply saddened."

542
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:49,570
"Having become an outsider,
today my sister.."

543
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:54,885
"..goes to her husband's abode."

544
00:48:58,103 --> 00:48:59,447
Brother!

545
00:49:05,983 --> 00:49:08,921
Gulshan..
Please take care of Geeta.

546
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:12,624
You do not worry.
I can give up my life for Geeta.

547
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:18,780
Go sister.. get going!

548
00:49:28,228 --> 00:49:31,853
Tinku..
Go and leave Geeta and come.

549
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,297
Brother!
Brother! That pill you gave me..

550
00:49:38,416 --> 00:49:41,280
...It heating up my
insides like a furnace!

551
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,858
There is a typhoon inside.

552
00:49:42,978 --> 00:49:46,255
Brother.. when will there
be an outlet to this typhoon?

553
00:49:46,376 --> 00:49:49,818
Hey Chutiya.. this typhoon
will find its outlet very soon.

554
00:49:49,938 --> 00:49:52,068
Gulshan must be just
coming along with Geeta now.

555
00:49:52,188 --> 00:49:55,740
After that you do whatever
you wish with her.

556
00:49:57,632 --> 00:49:59,319
There! Gulshan has come.

557
00:50:00,242 --> 00:50:02,273
Gulshan..
Where have you brought me?

558
00:50:02,523 --> 00:50:04,695
Where you are supposed to go! Go!

559
00:50:05,007 --> 00:50:06,289
Go into Chutiya's arms!

560
00:50:08,577 --> 00:50:11,858
Brother.. it is my first time.
So I am feeling very shy!

561
00:50:11,978 --> 00:50:14,577
Gulshan!..
Gulshan! - I will not let you go!

562
00:50:14,697 --> 00:50:17,931
I've had vitamin.

563
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,509
- Vitamins.
- Gulshan!

564
00:50:21,306 --> 00:50:23,494
Let me go!

565
00:50:24,634 --> 00:50:27,353
- Help me!
- Open it!

566
00:50:27,603 --> 00:50:29,289
Let me go!

567
00:50:31,545 --> 00:50:33,311
- Help me!
- I'm enjoying it.

568
00:50:33,686 --> 00:50:35,717
Leave me!

569
00:50:36,686 --> 00:50:38,530
Leave me!

570
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:40,217
Help me!

571
00:50:49,434 --> 00:50:53,514
She is dead!..
Oh no! What do I do now?

572
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,092
I will throw her
dead body in the jungle.

573
00:51:19,063 --> 00:51:20,313
Geeta!

574
00:51:25,487 --> 00:51:26,691
Geeta!

575
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,398
Brother! Brother! Brother!
Brother! Save me brother!

576
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:03,163
Brother Bulla! Save me! Save me!

577
00:52:03,284 --> 00:52:05,492
Save me brother!

578
00:52:05,612 --> 00:52:08,141
That Shankar has found
out that I have raped his sister.

579
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,563
Is it a bad thing to rape?

580
00:52:09,682 --> 00:52:10,682
I will handle him.

581
00:52:13,655 --> 00:52:15,405
Brother.. he has come brother!

582
00:52:15,525 --> 00:52:17,402
Let go of me!
He has killed my sister.

583
00:52:17,521 --> 00:52:20,605
If you try to do anything..
I will kill you.

584
00:52:21,635 --> 00:52:24,635
Oh I see!
So you are the wall behind whom..

585
00:52:25,152 --> 00:52:27,621
...these people are creating havoc?

586
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:31,298
Your sister is dead!
What do you wish for now?

587
00:52:31,893 --> 00:52:33,485
That your father becomes lonesome?

588
00:52:34,126 --> 00:52:36,846
That he begs on the
streets after he retires?

589
00:52:37,644 --> 00:52:41,237
If not on yourself, at least
have some pity on his condition?

590
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:44,394
A poor constable!
Seeing his plight..

591
00:52:45,114 --> 00:52:50,798
...I feel like dropping
down like tears from my eyes.

592
00:52:53,096 --> 00:52:56,768
Can I know the reason
behind this false sympathy?

593
00:52:57,112 --> 00:53:00,903
This sympathy is because..
We think you are a toy.

594
00:53:01,465 --> 00:53:05,262
Seeing you seething with
rage makes us so joyful.

595
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:07,804
Just like the joy some
naughty children derive..

596
00:53:07,925 --> 00:53:10,211
...from ripping apart
a toy's hands and legs..

597
00:53:10,331 --> 00:53:12,102
...by clapping their hands.

598
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:16,229
If you die, then whom
will we look at and laugh?

599
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:18,885
And with whose tears will
we light the lamps on Diwali?

600
00:53:19,728 --> 00:53:23,134
This is why we have not yet
fixed your date with death yet.

601
00:53:23,255 --> 00:53:27,717
And Shankar..
You are such a comedy film for us..

602
00:53:27,836 --> 00:53:30,686
...which has a tragic ending to it.

603
00:53:30,967 --> 00:53:33,170
Now go home and take the Lords name.

604
00:53:33,289 --> 00:53:35,404
Or else, we will change history.

605
00:53:35,525 --> 00:53:39,313
Then Rama had killed Ravana.
But now, all of us, Ravana's..

606
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:41,032
...will kill this Rama.

607
00:53:41,152 --> 00:53:43,094
Hey! The name of the
person who changes history..

608
00:53:43,213 --> 00:53:45,110
...is never mentioned in history!

609
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:47,407
Because history is like
a line etched by stone.

610
00:53:47,836 --> 00:53:48,836
The person who tries
to wipe that line..

611
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,048
...gets wiped out himself,
in such a manner..

612
00:53:50,532 --> 00:53:52,454
...as though he were never born.

613
00:53:52,773 --> 00:53:55,570
And yes!
Like the entire station trembles..

614
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,304
...when a train approaches.

615
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:02,601
Likewise, you will also
tremble fearing me now!

616
00:54:03,478 --> 00:54:06,962
That is my promise.
And I swear by the embers..

617
00:54:07,525 --> 00:54:09,900
...that will emanate from
the funeral pyre of my sister!

618
00:54:46,746 --> 00:54:53,204
"A brother had seen
off this sister.."

619
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:58,710
"..as a bride."

620
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:06,335
"But this treacherous moment.."

621
00:55:06,454 --> 00:55:11,826
"..has forced her to die!"

622
00:55:13,016 --> 00:55:19,458
"A brother lost his sister's.."

623
00:55:19,577 --> 00:55:24,909
"..loving embrace so soon."

624
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:31,142
"Having lit the funeral pyre.."

625
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:42,525
"Having lit the funeral pyre,.."

626
00:55:42,646 --> 00:55:48,856
"..the brother's
heart lies shattered!"

627
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:55,038
"The brother's heart
lies shattered!"

628
00:56:09,989 --> 00:56:15,105
I know, my son.. that the fire
of revenge in burning within you.

629
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:18,606
But I beg you with
folded hands, son.

630
00:56:19,012 --> 00:56:22,059
Forget whatever happened.

631
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:26,896
Father.. they have
dragged my innocent sister..

632
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,584
...on a bed of thorns
and killed her.

633
00:56:30,927 --> 00:56:33,655
I will also kill
them so mercilessly..

634
00:56:34,672 --> 00:56:39,295
...that even after death
their souls would suffer in pain.

635
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:43,483
No, my child!
They are very dangerous people.

636
00:56:44,228 --> 00:56:47,009
They chop people like vegetables.

637
00:56:48,275 --> 00:56:50,853
Lambu Haata was a very big goon.

638
00:56:51,447 --> 00:56:54,025
But Bulla got rid
of every trace of him.

639
00:56:55,126 --> 00:56:58,704
They represent such
hell like crime..

640
00:56:59,001 --> 00:57:03,016
...in front of which you
are nothing but a small ember!

641
00:57:07,733 --> 00:57:10,608
It is these embers that
give rise to fire in hell father.

642
00:57:11,842 --> 00:57:15,291
Now you watch..
I will make their hooliganism..

643
00:57:15,411 --> 00:57:20,088
...don such a garb of death
which is called a coffin!

644
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:23,791
Brother.. Shankar's heart
is smouldering with rage.

645
00:57:23,911 --> 00:57:25,985
We may have killed Geeta.

646
00:57:26,422 --> 00:57:28,532
But what will happen
if Shankar does something?

647
00:57:28,652 --> 00:57:30,501
His father is with the police!

648
00:57:30,766 --> 00:57:34,235
Hey! His father is only
a small time constable, Chhutiya.

649
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:38,395
And who will listen
to what a small man says?

650
00:57:45,474 --> 00:57:46,662
Inspector sir..

651
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:50,054
What is the matter, Ram Singh?

652
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:54,210
You know my daughter has
been murdered, inspector sir?

653
00:57:55,913 --> 00:57:59,644
You also know who has
committed that murder.

654
00:58:00,972 --> 00:58:04,739
Why do you not arrest
him sir? Why?

655
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:08,166
Do you have any evidence..

656
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:09,947
...based on which
I could arrest him?

657
00:58:10,067 --> 00:58:12,025
Inspector sir..

658
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:18,182
You manage to gather evidences
against the innocent.

659
00:58:19,978 --> 00:58:23,666
But you demand evidences
to prove the guilty?

660
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:31,702
You are a traitor!
You have licked Bulla's spit.

661
00:58:32,248 --> 00:58:35,186
- You have drunk his urine!
- Hey!

662
00:58:36,545 --> 00:58:39,451
Beat me!..
Beat me as much as you wish.

663
00:58:41,326 --> 00:58:46,463
But let me tell you..
This role of..

664
00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:50,604
...yours will not last, inspector.

665
00:58:51,322 --> 00:58:55,963
Donning the uniform,
you are protecting hooliganism?

666
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:58,166
Do you know what the
outcome of this will be?

667
00:58:59,822 --> 00:59:01,275
Go away! Go away!

668
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:05,577
You will end up dying..
But you cant harm me at all.

669
00:59:06,172 --> 00:59:08,280
I have brother Bulla's
hand over my head.

670
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:13,530
Yes! Let one of his
hand be on your head..

671
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:18,436
...while you let his other
hand on your daughter's waist.

672
00:59:18,827 --> 00:59:22,561
Send your sister to his bed!
Hey!

673
00:59:24,452 --> 00:59:27,343
You have abused my
daughter and sister.

674
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:30,343
Had you not burnt
up your daughter..

675
00:59:30,905 --> 00:59:33,467
...I would not have spared
that dead girl either.

676
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:40,974
Fine! I have stopped my son,
Shankar a lot till now.

677
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:45,693
But now..
I will not stop him any more.

678
00:59:46,742 --> 00:59:51,273
You will die! You will
also die and so will that Bulla!

679
00:59:51,393 --> 00:59:54,461
You will all die!
You will all die!

680
01:00:03,632 --> 01:00:09,796
I will die when I have to.
But today.. you will die for sure!

681
01:01:11,695 --> 01:01:13,570
Inspector,
you did a very good thing..

682
01:01:13,851 --> 01:01:15,961
...by killing Shankar's father!

683
01:01:16,081 --> 01:01:17,836
Hearing of his father's death..

684
01:01:17,956 --> 01:01:20,148
...his heart must
be burning with rage.

685
01:01:20,268 --> 01:01:22,588
And exclaiming, "Father!
Father!"..

686
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:25,010
...he must be running
towards his father's body.

687
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:29,822
Father!

688
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:35,815
Father!

689
01:01:43,882 --> 01:01:48,147
Bulla!.. Bulla!

690
01:01:55,621 --> 01:01:58,965
Hey Shankar..
Who is this on your shoulder?

691
01:01:59,085 --> 01:02:03,156
This I my father..
Who fell pray to your plot.

692
01:02:03,907 --> 01:02:07,922
We do not hunt animals.
We hunt human beings!

693
01:02:08,344 --> 01:02:11,204
Yes! He is a law abiding animal.

694
01:02:11,766 --> 01:02:13,796
That is why he served
the law in return for which..

695
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:15,842
...this is the reward he gets.

696
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:17,936
The law itself killed him.

697
01:02:19,467 --> 01:02:20,960
If you want to give a speech,
go to the crossroads..

698
01:02:21,081 --> 01:02:22,521
...and give it in
front of the public.

699
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,976
Yes, if you need any
petty cash for his funeral..

700
01:02:25,097 --> 01:02:26,242
...take it from us.

701
01:02:26,362 --> 01:02:30,461
I have not come to ask for money..
But to warn you.

702
01:02:30,862 --> 01:02:34,065
And I have brought my
father's body only because..

703
01:02:34,186 --> 01:02:36,316
...today's encounter
should be memorable!

704
01:02:36,612 --> 01:02:39,706
So that you people never
forget the day that is today!

705
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:42,159
Why.. why is that?

706
01:02:42,847 --> 01:02:46,425
That is because till today,
you people would fix dates..

707
01:02:46,545 --> 01:02:48,722
...for other people's deaths.

708
01:02:49,362 --> 01:02:53,492
Today.. I have fixed
the date for all your deaths.

709
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:59,008
Remember.. today is the 1st.

710
01:02:59,726 --> 01:03:04,452
2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th.
That's it!

711
01:03:05,514 --> 01:03:06,904
Just wait for it!

712
01:03:13,262 --> 01:03:21,262
"Oh Lord of this world,
give us any punishment."

713
01:03:21,476 --> 01:03:29,387
"Just let me know..
What my mistake is."

714
01:03:30,184 --> 01:03:35,081
"I will not bear
all this atrocity.."

715
01:03:35,201 --> 01:03:40,784
"..and torture anymore."

716
01:03:42,273 --> 01:03:50,273
"I will destroy all my enemies!"

717
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:25,786
"This little life is lying here.."

718
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:32,436
"..on the streets uncared for."

719
01:04:39,018 --> 01:04:45,369
"There is no one who
it can call its own."

720
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:52,024
"There is no one to call,
its successor."

721
01:04:56,074 --> 01:05:00,090
There is crime at every step..
Sin at every step.

722
01:05:00,918 --> 01:05:03,337
When it comes to committing sins.

723
01:05:03,931 --> 01:05:05,962
Man is worse than even the devil!

724
01:05:17,382 --> 01:05:19,132
Hey.. whose child is this?

725
01:05:19,253 --> 01:05:21,480
Someone had abandoned
it on the streets.

726
01:05:22,242 --> 01:05:25,385
I have adopted it now.
Now you and I will raise it..

727
01:05:26,072 --> 01:05:28,041
...as its own mother and father.

728
01:05:28,666 --> 01:05:32,135
God is very generous.
He blesses in many ways.

729
01:05:32,385 --> 01:05:34,369
Look.. we are not even married..

730
01:05:34,489 --> 01:05:36,366
But God has still
blessed us with a child.

731
01:05:40,195 --> 01:05:41,820
We will name her Geeta.

732
01:05:52,244 --> 01:05:56,496
If you die.. who will we laugh at?

733
01:06:10,248 --> 01:06:12,684
Do not let this fire die out,
Shankar.

734
01:06:13,465 --> 01:06:19,318
Keep poking at the lava
that is burning within you.

735
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:22,068
Like that Chhutiya
raped your sister.

736
01:06:22,188 --> 01:06:23,474
You too should let
the hatred for Chhutiya..

737
01:06:23,594 --> 01:06:25,692
...keep burning within your heart.

738
01:06:25,813 --> 01:06:30,492
And burn him down in
the rage of your hatred!

739
01:06:31,478 --> 01:06:36,228
And.. turn him into ashes!

740
01:06:37,244 --> 01:06:41,403
Then.. then you will see
what fate befalls that Chhutiya.

741
01:06:42,012 --> 01:06:46,215
Chhutiya.. I have heard
that you dragged Shankar's sister..

742
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,934
...on a bed of thorns
and killed her?

743
01:06:49,242 --> 01:06:51,789
What do I say the pill
that brother gave me..

744
01:06:51,909 --> 01:06:54,533
...It was that which
made me do all that!

745
01:06:55,315 --> 01:06:57,737
Arrange a girl for me too?

746
01:06:57,856 --> 01:07:02,050
Yes.. that Gulshan..
Who gave me the girl.

747
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:03,771
He has married again.

748
01:07:03,891 --> 01:07:06,630
Wow! What a girl she is!
I will do one thing.

749
01:07:06,751 --> 01:07:08,412
I will send that girl to you.

750
01:07:08,677 --> 01:07:10,677
Will Gulshan get me a girl?

751
01:07:10,797 --> 01:07:12,813
Just keep having fun.

752
01:07:13,251 --> 01:07:16,110
Just have fun.
Why don't you understand?

753
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:17,688
Here is the pill.

754
01:07:20,775 --> 01:07:23,447
Not me.. go there.. to that girl.

755
01:07:34,289 --> 01:07:35,289
How did this happen?

756
01:07:35,331 --> 01:07:37,336
Kamala's mother committed suicide.

757
01:07:39,009 --> 01:07:40,009
Why?

758
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:42,550
She got her daughter
married to a boy.

759
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:45,847
Apparently, he is a pimp.
He marries young girls..

760
01:07:45,967 --> 01:07:47,831
...and sells them to brothels.

761
01:07:47,952 --> 01:07:50,176
What is his name?
His name is Gulshan.

762
01:07:50,295 --> 01:07:51,503
Here is his photograph.

763
01:07:57,744 --> 01:08:00,338
We have heard that he
is a friend of the pimp, Lucky.

764
01:08:02,657 --> 01:08:03,907
Lucky Chikna!

765
01:08:12,925 --> 01:08:17,425
Hey you prostitutes!

766
01:08:17,847 --> 01:08:21,003
All you pimps!

767
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:24,317
Listen to what Lucky
Chikna has to say.

768
01:08:24,436 --> 01:08:26,738
Look at what Lucky
Chikna is going to do.

769
01:08:26,859 --> 01:08:29,176
Come here..
I have a complaint against you.

770
01:08:29,296 --> 01:08:32,530
What are you staring at? Come here.

771
01:08:38,671 --> 01:08:43,319
What do you think
of yourself, woman?

772
01:08:45,113 --> 01:08:46,597
What is the matter, Lucky Chikna?

773
01:08:46,878 --> 01:08:49,472
Your client is awaiting
you upstairs..

774
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:53,909
...and you are standing
hugging this fellow here?

775
01:08:54,426 --> 01:08:58,349
That fellow is a 60 year old man.
He does nothing.

776
01:08:58,469 --> 01:09:01,426
He tells me to suck his finger.

777
01:09:01,744 --> 01:09:05,713
Look here..
When you are in this business..

778
01:09:06,136 --> 01:09:09,104
...you cannot pick and choose.

779
01:09:09,511 --> 01:09:13,417
Go and please that old man.
I do not want any complaints.

780
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:20,310
I will not go. - I will
belt you and skin you alive. Go!

781
01:09:26,697 --> 01:09:28,650
Hey.. get a cup of tea!

782
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:38,134
Hey.. you do not know
whom you have raise your hand at.

783
01:09:39,806 --> 01:09:43,337
Tell me where is Gulshan?
I swear, I do not know.

784
01:09:43,457 --> 01:09:48,536
I will kill you, you pimp!
Tell me where is Gulshan?

785
01:09:52,301 --> 01:09:55,255
You could've hit me
when I was alone.

786
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:57,775
Why are you humiliating me
in front of all these prostitutes?

787
01:09:57,859 --> 01:10:01,517
I will not spare you.
I am a dangerous man!

788
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:03,735
Move aside!

789
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,271
You destroyed my
sister like alright.

790
01:10:24,162 --> 01:10:27,115
But now, I will not let
you ruin any other daughter..

791
01:10:27,235 --> 01:10:29,474
...or sister's life.

792
01:10:29,595 --> 01:10:31,275
Tell me where is Kamala?
I do not know.

793
01:10:32,259 --> 01:10:34,930
I am asking you for the last time.
Where is Kamala?

794
01:10:35,051 --> 01:10:38,088
Kamala is with Ebu Hatela.

795
01:10:38,207 --> 01:10:39,868
Ebu Hatela!

796
01:10:49,259 --> 01:10:51,212
Look.. I have taken my clothes off.

797
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,680
Now you also take your clothes off.
- Why?

798
01:10:53,801 --> 01:10:55,900
Hey.. hasn't Gulshan told you what to do?
- Let go!

799
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:58,979
Listen.. - Leave me.
Come on. She left.

800
01:10:59,099 --> 01:11:01,400
Hey.. where are you?
Where are you?

801
01:11:01,792 --> 01:11:03,573
Where are you?

802
01:11:06,573 --> 01:11:09,917
Shankar..
You? - Yes! Shankar! Your death!

803
01:11:10,338 --> 01:11:15,073
Shankar.. do not fight with me.
My name is Ebu Hatela.

804
01:11:15,525 --> 01:11:19,194
My mother is the daughter
of the devil.. my father a demon!

805
01:11:19,444 --> 01:11:20,585
Will you have a banana?

806
01:11:20,706 --> 01:11:23,476
After today,
no one will call you Ebu Hatela.

807
01:11:24,288 --> 01:11:26,085
You will be called Ebu Katela.

808
01:11:26,617 --> 01:11:27,711
What?

809
01:11:32,268 --> 01:11:33,518
Save me!

810
01:12:01,024 --> 01:12:02,196
A grave yard!?

811
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:07,853
Alas! I am done for
today from all sides!

812
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:29,783
No! No!

813
01:12:35,003 --> 01:12:38,817
Where do I go? Somebody save me.

814
01:12:57,234 --> 01:12:58,484
No.

815
01:13:37,202 --> 01:13:38,202
No.

816
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:52,594
Save me! No, leave me.

817
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:19,194
Shankar.. hey Shankar!
What harm have I done to you..

818
01:14:19,314 --> 01:14:21,600
...that you are trying to kill me?

819
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,350
You made fun of my sister's death?

820
01:14:25,537 --> 01:14:30,134
You called is the trailer
of a film.. with a tragic ending?

821
01:14:30,884 --> 01:14:35,853
Now see.. what a horrible
tragedy occurs with you.

822
01:14:54,487 --> 01:14:58,112
"My brother became a youth today."

823
01:14:58,231 --> 01:15:00,903
"A broken arrow has become.."

824
01:15:01,023 --> 01:15:02,793
Hello? Who is speaking?

825
01:15:02,913 --> 01:15:05,402
This is Shankar speaking.
Give the phone to Bulla.

826
01:15:05,523 --> 01:15:07,356
Brother Bulla cannot
come on the phone.

827
01:15:07,476 --> 01:15:10,762
He is doing disco
dance with the eunuchs.

828
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:14,454
Tell him to stop
dancing with eunuchs..

829
01:15:14,814 --> 01:15:16,657
...and talk to a man instead.

830
01:15:17,173 --> 01:15:22,333
Brother.. Shankar has called.
He asking you to talk to a man.

831
01:15:24,271 --> 01:15:25,443
Yes Shankar.. tell me?

832
01:15:26,114 --> 01:15:29,271
Today I am celebrating
Chhutiya's attaining manhood!

833
01:15:29,646 --> 01:15:31,341
Stop celebrating and start mourning.

834
01:15:32,043 --> 01:15:35,653
Because I have ripped out
the first pillar of hooliganism..

835
01:15:36,356 --> 01:15:38,668
...who is called Ebu Hatela!

836
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,560
What happened?

837
01:15:59,934 --> 01:16:03,199
What do you think Shankar?
That you have become..

838
01:16:03,496 --> 01:16:05,527
...a big don by killing Ebu Hatela?

839
01:16:05,969 --> 01:16:10,797
A don is bigger than everyone.
And I am bigger than you all!

840
01:16:11,376 --> 01:16:15,001
I am such a father..
Who awaits the pre fixed dates..

841
01:16:15,578 --> 01:16:18,021
...to kill his
illegitimate children.

842
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:20,428
Before these dates arrive,
I will rip apart..

843
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:23,412
...the calendar of your life.

844
01:16:23,532 --> 01:16:27,333
Your dates will come..
But after your death.

845
01:16:28,014 --> 01:16:29,454
Bulla, are you looking
at this crane?

846
01:16:31,029 --> 01:16:33,747
Its condition is the same as yours.

847
01:16:33,868 --> 01:16:37,014
When its chain breaks,
it is rendered useless.

848
01:16:37,389 --> 01:16:40,779
And useless items are
always thrown in trash!

849
01:16:41,856 --> 01:16:45,483
I am not a crane, Shankar!
I am the ship itself..

850
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:49,314
...which rips the sea also
apart while surging forward!

851
01:16:50,109 --> 01:16:52,453
You position in front of
us is like that of a cloth..

852
01:16:52,573 --> 01:16:54,750
...in front of a scissor.

853
01:16:55,157 --> 01:16:58,141
Cloth.. it is this very cloth..

854
01:16:58,261 --> 01:17:00,376
...that creates maximum
trouble in the end.

855
01:17:00,496 --> 01:17:04,532
When this cloth gets wrapped
around like a coffin..

856
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:07,685
...one has to be buried.

857
01:17:28,675 --> 01:17:29,846
What is the matter Shankar?

858
01:17:29,966 --> 01:17:31,518
Why are you going far from me?

859
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:36,112
The war has started Ganga.
I have started killing them.

860
01:17:36,233 --> 01:17:37,864
Don't those at war, not love?

861
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:43,661
In this fire of hatred,
I have forgotten to love.

862
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:50,072
Get used to it.
Get used to living without me.

863
01:18:10,438 --> 01:18:15,938
"I do not like to live without you."

864
01:18:17,438 --> 01:18:23,327
"I do not like to live without you."

865
01:18:23,796 --> 01:18:28,983
"Even when I cry..
He does not come close to me."

866
01:18:29,103 --> 01:18:34,515
"The mind fears
in this restlessness."

867
01:18:34,635 --> 01:18:39,921
"The mind fears
in this restlessness."

868
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:45,195
"I came into this world..
Only for you."

869
01:18:45,314 --> 01:18:50,694
"I do not like to live without you."

870
01:19:22,264 --> 01:19:24,685
"Whenever you look into my eyes."

871
01:19:24,805 --> 01:19:27,747
"You will only find love."

872
01:19:30,292 --> 01:19:32,768
"Whenever you look into my eyes."

873
01:19:32,889 --> 01:19:35,675
"You will only find love."

874
01:19:35,795 --> 01:19:41,014
"I wish that moment
comes when we unite at one."

875
01:19:41,134 --> 01:19:46,311
"Do not break your promise..
Why would I break it, my love?"

876
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:51,983
"Never let go of me..
Why would I let go, my love?"

877
01:19:52,234 --> 01:19:57,367
"What is that promise,
which cannot be kept!"

878
01:19:57,487 --> 01:20:02,336
"I do not like to live without you."

879
01:20:03,055 --> 01:20:08,216
"I do not like to live without you."

880
01:20:29,275 --> 01:20:31,869
"Look at those milestones..
As they look at us.."

881
01:20:31,989 --> 01:20:35,104
"..with those loving eyes."

882
01:20:37,354 --> 01:20:39,932
"Look at those milestones..
As they look at us.."

883
01:20:40,052 --> 01:20:42,604
"..with those loving eyes."

884
01:20:42,725 --> 01:20:48,021
"Darling, let me get free
from my helplessness."

885
01:20:48,141 --> 01:20:53,282
"On the path of life..
We have to walk united."

886
01:20:53,403 --> 01:20:58,585
“Being there for each other..
We have to be there always.”

887
01:20:58,704 --> 01:21:04,365
“This colour of love
just keeps deepening.”

888
01:21:04,631 --> 01:21:09,784
“I do not like to live without you.”

889
01:21:09,904 --> 01:21:15,175
“I do not like to live without you.”

890
01:21:15,296 --> 01:21:20,498
“Even when I cry..
He does not come close to me.”

891
01:21:20,618 --> 01:21:25,811
“The mind fears
in this restlessness.”

892
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:31,226
“The mind fears
in this restlessness.”

893
01:21:31,346 --> 01:21:36,648
“I came into this world..
Only for you.”

894
01:21:36,769 --> 01:21:41,238
"“I do not like to live without you."

895
01:21:41,358 --> 01:21:46,851
"“I do not like to live without you."

896
01:21:49,898 --> 01:21:53,418
Bachchu bhai, you called hundred
times to take extortion money.

897
01:21:53,538 --> 01:21:55,148
Now you came here.
Couldn't you wait?

898
01:21:55,268 --> 01:21:58,430
Hey! I have may have patience..
But not my seat!

899
01:21:59,024 --> 01:22:01,846
Before the month ends,
it starts asking for the dues.

900
01:22:01,966 --> 01:22:03,705
One has to keep adding to that.

901
01:22:03,826 --> 01:22:07,408
Mr. addition, we give extortion
money of one crore rupees.

902
01:22:07,529 --> 01:22:09,613
Yet your tummy never
seems to be satiated?

903
01:22:09,733 --> 01:22:12,019
I do not eat your 1 crore alone.

904
01:22:12,139 --> 01:22:13,764
I have to feed those above me too.

905
01:22:13,884 --> 01:22:15,725
You deal with those above you.
But henceforth..

906
01:22:15,837 --> 01:22:17,638
...if you come to my
house to collect the dues.

907
01:22:17,743 --> 01:22:19,373
Then I will come to
your house and bash you up.

908
01:22:19,493 --> 01:22:22,623
If I find you on the road,
I will beat you there.

909
01:22:22,743 --> 01:22:25,967
If I find you on the bed,
I will bash you there.

910
01:22:26,087 --> 01:22:28,421
Hey! Get lost!
Those who would give such threats..

911
01:22:28,702 --> 01:22:31,077
...are cooling their
heels in the jail. Go and see.

912
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:38,554
I will deal with them later.
But I will shoot you first.

913
01:22:38,673 --> 01:22:41,381
I am Shankar speaking.
Yes Shankar.

914
01:22:41,502 --> 01:22:46,025
You have killed Ebu Hatela.
Hand yourself over to the law.

915
01:22:46,145 --> 01:22:48,541
You also hand yourself
over to the law.

916
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:52,244
Because you have covered
up for every crime if Bulla's.

917
01:22:52,712 --> 01:22:56,788
It is for this service that
we enjoy wealth and have fun.

918
01:22:56,908 --> 01:23:00,007
I will kill.. I will kill you too.

919
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,461
Hey get lost!
How will you kill me?

920
01:23:02,581 --> 01:23:05,180
I have endless police
vehicles all around me.

921
01:23:05,652 --> 01:23:10,746
When the time comes..
All these vehicles..

922
01:23:11,698 --> 01:23:16,832
...protecting you, will all vanish.

923
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,826
Patkar.. is everything okay?

924
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:35,741
The minister's vehicle has
just left. Everything is okay.

925
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:38,538
Yes, sir.

926
01:26:45,836 --> 01:26:48,711
Get up! Where are you hiding?

927
01:26:51,692 --> 01:26:54,613
Shankar, don't kill me.
I have to serve the nation.

928
01:26:54,957 --> 01:26:56,911
Had you really served them..

929
01:26:57,442 --> 01:26:59,755
...you wouldn't be in such
situation today.

930
01:27:01,163 --> 01:27:03,726
You are very fond of eating sweets,
are you not?

931
01:27:03,846 --> 01:27:07,476
See, how where this liking
of yours leads you today.

932
01:27:12,908 --> 01:27:15,361
Shankar, I bind you with your
sister's oath, don't kill me.

933
01:27:15,704 --> 01:27:19,064
The man who shed false
tears at my sisters death.

934
01:27:19,689 --> 01:27:24,097
You will shed real tears
today at your own death! - No!

935
01:27:38,009 --> 01:27:40,353
This court pronounces
life imprisonment..

936
01:27:40,472 --> 01:27:44,689
...to Shankar for the murder
of minister, Bachchu Bhaghona.

937
01:27:51,048 --> 01:27:54,914
You had to go somewhere and
you landed somewhere else, got it?

938
01:27:56,414 --> 01:27:58,882
You sang a song..
Now hear this couplet.

939
01:27:59,914 --> 01:28:04,601
A wet cigarette will never burn.
And it is final..

940
01:28:05,128 --> 01:28:08,909
...that the date of your
death will not be postponed.

941
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:14,722
Shankar.. by killing your father,
I have ripped your roots.

942
01:28:14,972 --> 01:28:16,894
You are but an ordinary leaf.

943
01:28:17,253 --> 01:28:19,133
I will pluck and throw
you away whenever I wish.

944
01:28:28,006 --> 01:28:30,068
You dare to threaten the inspector.

945
01:28:30,693 --> 01:28:35,787
Do not forget what
we did with your sister.

946
01:28:36,912 --> 01:28:39,208
Now we are going to bang the drum.

947
01:28:39,328 --> 01:28:41,438
Those are played by eunuchs.

948
01:28:42,688 --> 01:28:46,470
And when a man plays,
he plays with a huge band.

949
01:28:47,095 --> 01:28:54,344
Every bruise on me
proclaims your death!

950
01:28:59,811 --> 01:29:02,561
Hello? - Sir, This is constable
Ram Singh from the police station.

951
01:29:02,681 --> 01:29:04,358
Hey! Why are you calling
so late in the night?

952
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:05,919
Sir, Shankar has run away from Jail.

953
01:29:05,962 --> 01:29:08,750
What? Shankar has run away?

954
01:29:14,233 --> 01:29:16,108
Shankar, you shouldn't
have come here.

955
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:18,482
The police has enquired
about you number of times.

956
01:29:19,264 --> 01:29:22,706
Do you know who killed
my father, Ganga?

957
01:29:22,826 --> 01:29:25,644
- No!
- Inspect Kale.

958
01:29:27,471 --> 01:29:30,081
I have fixed the date for his death.

959
01:29:31,474 --> 01:29:33,927
The police will be
making rounds of my house.

960
01:29:34,926 --> 01:29:37,583
And I will ensure
that he meets his end.

961
01:29:40,489 --> 01:29:45,135
Inspector Kale, you are
going to die now.

962
01:29:45,255 --> 01:29:50,760
What a big risk. The date
for your death has been fixed.

963
01:29:51,024 --> 01:29:55,106
Come on..
Lie down. Come on.. die now.

964
01:29:55,226 --> 01:29:59,059
Lie.. die.. lie.. die..

965
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:03,374
Hey! If I die, then who will
save you from the hands of law?

966
01:30:04,484 --> 01:30:08,452
The death of a guard will
not onset any thefts in the house.

967
01:30:08,572 --> 01:30:11,717
Neither does the face remain
dirty if a handkerchief tears.

968
01:30:11,837 --> 01:30:14,947
You will go another fellow will come.
- No one will come.

969
01:30:15,587 --> 01:30:17,681
Only Shankar will leave this world.

970
01:30:18,041 --> 01:30:20,525
I have called him to the war field.

971
01:30:21,864 --> 01:30:24,583
I will make goons don
police uniforms and take them.

972
01:30:24,703 --> 01:30:28,208
And then I will show you,
what death is like.

973
01:30:28,591 --> 01:30:30,701
And how one kills ones enemy.

974
01:30:31,077 --> 01:30:35,646
He will die.. he.. will die!

975
01:34:19,547 --> 01:34:20,547
No!

976
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:22,775
You killed my father
and said that you had..

977
01:34:23,555 --> 01:34:25,570
...ripped apart my roots.

978
01:34:26,063 --> 01:34:30,188
That I am a leaf.
Plucking me will not take time.

979
01:34:30,625 --> 01:34:31,625
No!

980
01:34:31,713 --> 01:34:34,907
Now look! The same
leaf has become the reason..

981
01:34:35,421 --> 01:34:37,295
...for your death now.

982
01:34:38,436 --> 01:34:39,467
No!

983
01:35:02,002 --> 01:35:04,960
Inspector had been with
an army of police to kill Shankar.

984
01:35:05,081 --> 01:35:06,081
He died.

985
01:35:06,122 --> 01:35:09,986
Brother, I'm telling you.
Kill Shankar soon.

986
01:35:10,106 --> 01:35:13,175
Else we won't find anyone
to take our pyre.

987
01:35:13,918 --> 01:35:16,137
He will be blown to pieces today..

988
01:35:16,904 --> 01:35:22,334
...when my men will
surround Shankar like death.

989
01:38:17,025 --> 01:38:19,844
Look Shankar..
This battle that you are fighting..

990
01:38:19,963 --> 01:38:21,484
...could result in anything.

991
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:23,125
If something happens to you..

992
01:38:23,246 --> 01:38:24,984
...then what happens to our child?

993
01:38:26,563 --> 01:38:28,883
The child that does not have
its parents hand blessing it..

994
01:38:29,109 --> 01:38:30,921
God is always with it.

995
01:38:31,609 --> 01:38:33,375
Do not leave everything on to God.

996
01:38:33,494 --> 01:38:37,358
Search for its father.
Force him to accept this child.

997
01:38:38,609 --> 01:38:40,203
But how will we search for him?

998
01:38:40,323 --> 01:38:43,197
Today morning,
aunty Shanti told me..

999
01:38:43,317 --> 01:38:44,947
...that the person who
dumped this child in the bin..

1000
01:38:45,067 --> 01:38:46,243
...was Lucky Chikna.

1001
01:38:53,391 --> 01:38:55,907
Hey Lucky Chikna..
What is it, beautiful?

1002
01:38:57,345 --> 01:38:59,079
I got into this business
only because you told me to.

1003
01:38:59,198 --> 01:39:00,594
When will you make me a heroine?

1004
01:39:00,715 --> 01:39:03,775
You will surely become
the heroine's duplicate.

1005
01:39:03,895 --> 01:39:05,625
Miss Beautiful Tan Tan.

1006
01:39:05,744 --> 01:39:09,760
Even the corpse will start dancing
seeing you. Now stop smiling..

1007
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:12,425
...go to the 18 no. Cot,
he's waiting for you.

1008
01:39:12,545 --> 01:39:17,456
First give me what I want. - Hey,
see what they need and give to them.

1009
01:39:17,576 --> 01:39:22,300
Go and stand at the door
and attract more clients.

1010
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:23,639
Our business has to run.

1011
01:39:23,759 --> 01:39:26,576
You also go now..
Attend to your work.

1012
01:39:26,695 --> 01:39:30,528
Lucky Chikna, now you'll
become millionaire Chikna.

1013
01:39:37,493 --> 01:39:41,914
How did you like Lucky
Chikna's hanging circle dear?

1014
01:39:52,072 --> 01:39:54,671
This is called winning the battle.

1015
01:39:54,791 --> 01:39:58,322
Now you have to win
many battles here.

1016
01:40:14,908 --> 01:40:17,877
Hey you bastards! Save me someone!

1017
01:41:46,881 --> 01:41:49,460
Hey! Who are you?
Why are you bashing me up?

1018
01:41:49,579 --> 01:41:51,131
What harm have I done to you?

1019
01:41:51,252 --> 01:41:53,006
Tell me why are you beating me up?

1020
01:41:53,126 --> 01:41:56,631
Tell me, that day
whose daughter..

1021
01:41:56,751 --> 01:41:59,626
...did you throw in
the garbage bin?

1022
01:41:59,746 --> 01:42:02,047
That is brother Bulla's doing!

1023
01:42:02,438 --> 01:42:05,193
I brought one girl here from
the village with a lure for a job..

1024
01:42:05,313 --> 01:42:06,634
...and put her into this business.

1025
01:42:07,083 --> 01:42:10,302
Brother Bulla liked her a lot.
They became close..

1026
01:42:10,422 --> 01:42:14,103
...and she became pregnant
and had a daughter.

1027
01:42:14,556 --> 01:42:18,572
One day, that woman
came to me with her daughter.

1028
01:42:19,729 --> 01:42:21,557
- Brother Chikna..
- Sister Haseena?

1029
01:42:21,676 --> 01:42:24,473
Please take care of this child.
I have consumed poison.

1030
01:42:24,594 --> 01:42:27,505
This child belongs to Bulla..
Give it to him.

1031
01:42:27,625 --> 01:42:29,364
I will be very grateful.

1032
01:42:32,923 --> 01:42:38,783
Oh God, if I handover her
to brother Bulla, he will kill me.

1033
01:42:39,470 --> 01:42:44,371
Lucky Chikna.. put away
this dirt in the dustbin only.

1034
01:42:45,654 --> 01:42:48,638
After that woman's death,
had I taken that child..

1035
01:42:48,757 --> 01:42:50,387
...to brother Bulla,
he would have bashed me up.

1036
01:42:50,507 --> 01:42:54,293
That is why, to save my life,
I threw that child in the bin.

1037
01:42:54,747 --> 01:42:59,043
You cheat innocent girls
with the lure of jobs..

1038
01:42:59,418 --> 01:43:01,340
...and make then do such deeds.

1039
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:04,247
You are a shame to the society.

1040
01:43:04,841 --> 01:43:09,637
Such a man does not deserve
to remain on this earth.

1041
01:43:18,877 --> 01:43:21,239
Brother!
Brother! That Lucky Chikna is gone.

1042
01:43:21,488 --> 01:43:23,926
Shankar has killed him.

1043
01:43:24,046 --> 01:43:25,363
What are you saying Chhutiya?

1044
01:43:25,484 --> 01:43:29,630
Pothe, who doesn't fear anyone,
is running away fearing Shankar.

1045
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:32,882
Running away? How?
He must be riding a cycle.

1046
01:43:33,002 --> 01:43:35,799
If not on the cycle..
He might be fleeing by car.

1047
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:39,644
And if he does not get a car..
He might be fleeing by a ship.

1048
01:43:39,987 --> 01:43:43,033
- Oh, fleeing in a ship?
- Yes.

1049
01:43:48,256 --> 01:43:51,460
Look, Shankar can land
up here anytime as my death.

1050
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:54,591
Till my ship does
not go out of sight..

1051
01:43:55,279 --> 01:43:59,107
...keep a watch on every
nook and corner of this port.

1052
01:43:59,654 --> 01:44:00,857
Come with me.

1053
01:44:53,748 --> 01:44:55,810
Where are you fleeing Pothe?

1054
01:44:55,930 --> 01:45:00,662
I am not fleeing Shankar.
I was actually thinking..

1055
01:45:00,783 --> 01:45:03,085
...how you might get killed by me.

1056
01:45:03,569 --> 01:45:06,632
To tell you the truth,
I pity you a lot Shankar.

1057
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:09,803
You feel pity for me?
That is why you were making fun..

1058
01:45:09,922 --> 01:45:12,396
...of my father's death that day.

1059
01:45:13,006 --> 01:45:15,381
You were collecting
money for his funeral?

1060
01:45:15,501 --> 01:45:18,271
Shankar, don't go by
my dangerous face..

1061
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:22,804
I am like the coconut which is
hard from outside but soft within.

1062
01:45:23,087 --> 01:45:26,102
I also have a great amount
of sympathy for the poor people.

1063
01:45:26,462 --> 01:45:30,149
Sympathy?.. Your name is Pothe..

1064
01:45:30,663 --> 01:45:33,117
...and you do not even
belong to your own father.

1065
01:45:33,663 --> 01:45:36,148
And for someone who does
not even belong to his father..

1066
01:45:36,632 --> 01:45:40,054
...its is very essential
that their die.

1067
01:46:18,612 --> 01:46:20,815
Let me go! Let me go!

1068
01:46:23,503 --> 01:46:29,628
Let you go? Let go of
a sympathetic person like you?

1069
01:46:33,438 --> 01:46:39,172
Now get buried in the sea waves.

1070
01:47:04,850 --> 01:47:07,163
Now even Pothe has
been buried in the sea.

1071
01:47:07,283 --> 01:47:11,444
Brother.. Shankar has
been killing our men like dogs.

1072
01:47:11,564 --> 01:47:14,646
But we have not even
been able touch his hair.

1073
01:47:15,002 --> 01:47:21,909
I will do that.. I will
destroy that beautiful world..

1074
01:47:23,002 --> 01:47:25,783
...that resides in Shankar's heart.

1075
01:47:34,315 --> 01:47:35,534
Scoundrel!

1076
01:47:40,850 --> 01:47:42,163
No!

1077
01:47:42,586 --> 01:47:45,086
Let go of me! Let me go!

1078
01:47:48,122 --> 01:47:49,325
No!

1079
01:47:50,105 --> 01:47:52,402
Let go of me! Let me go!

1080
01:48:00,860 --> 01:48:03,798
- Leave me!
- Shankar's mistress.

1081
01:48:04,985 --> 01:48:09,367
Now I'll bite your fair cheeks.

1082
01:48:12,507 --> 01:48:15,429
Now you'll face my wrath.

1083
01:48:15,548 --> 01:48:20,042
I will make you wear
the ring of my lust.

1084
01:48:20,162 --> 01:48:22,917
You are not a man.. you are a dog!

1085
01:48:23,037 --> 01:48:26,292
Shankar has already ripped
apart three of your men.

1086
01:48:26,652 --> 01:48:31,777
Let me see how long
you manage to survive.

1087
01:48:34,807 --> 01:48:39,340
I am not just a bubble..
I am a volcano!

1088
01:48:39,761 --> 01:48:47,164
My name is Bulla! What ever I do,
I do it in the open!

1089
01:48:55,668 --> 01:49:00,636
No! No! Let me go!

1090
01:49:05,523 --> 01:49:07,132
Bulla!

1091
01:49:16,493 --> 01:49:18,664
Save me!

1092
01:49:30,814 --> 01:49:34,361
Go away..
Or else I will rip you apart.

1093
01:49:34,737 --> 01:49:38,641
If anyone steps forward..
I will bury you right here.

1094
01:49:39,438 --> 01:49:45,845
Because my name Bulla..
And I do everything in the open.

1095
01:49:45,965 --> 01:49:49,939
Let me go! Let me go!

1096
01:49:50,266 --> 01:49:51,657
Let her go!

1097
01:49:54,672 --> 01:49:56,063
No brother! No!

1098
01:49:56,626 --> 01:50:00,418
First, I will attack her..
And then you attack her.

1099
01:50:00,966 --> 01:50:02,856
- You will attack her?
- Yes brother.

1100
01:50:03,137 --> 01:50:05,451
Then assault her so brutally that..

1101
01:50:05,966 --> 01:50:10,756
...on hearing her shrieks..
Shankars heart bleeds!

1102
01:50:10,876 --> 01:50:13,600
Look.. let me go.. or else
the consequences will be very bad.

1103
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:16,412
Sully woman, I'll not spare you.

1104
01:50:16,532 --> 01:50:20,231
Shankar's mistress,
you are threatening us?

1105
01:50:20,351 --> 01:50:23,949
Today I'll give you such a shock..

1106
01:50:24,069 --> 01:50:26,996
...that you'll suffer
even after death.

1107
01:50:27,117 --> 01:50:33,836
Look.. what a long and
a broad knife I have.. - No!

1108
01:50:52,552 --> 01:50:56,693
Brother.. I did a good job, right?

1109
01:50:56,814 --> 01:51:04,140
Yes! You did a good thing.. that we
destroyed Shankar's entire world!

1110
01:51:06,217 --> 01:51:07,625
Is there anyone else?

1111
01:51:13,618 --> 01:51:15,884
Ganga!.. Ganga!

1112
01:51:16,509 --> 01:51:19,149
Who were those people?..
Who were they?

1113
01:51:19,854 --> 01:51:23,886
Bulla.. and.. Chhutiya.

1114
01:51:38,252 --> 01:51:41,331
Shankar will come and kill me now.

1115
01:51:42,064 --> 01:51:45,939
That is why I have started
preparing for my funeral.

1116
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:47,768
Its just my size.

1117
01:51:48,298 --> 01:51:50,581
I have to lie on
this only after I die.

1118
01:51:51,144 --> 01:51:52,487
But.. why should I die?

1119
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:56,101
My brother Bulla should die before me.

1120
01:51:56,221 --> 01:51:57,768
He ruined my life.

1121
01:51:58,127 --> 01:52:01,721
He fed me those pills right
from childhood till now.

1122
01:52:02,144 --> 01:52:04,440
Oh no! He spoilt me so much!

1123
01:52:04,721 --> 01:52:07,300
Yes.. if one has to die..
Then he should die.

1124
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:11,050
That bastard fixed dates
to kill Shankar thrice.

1125
01:52:11,170 --> 01:52:13,113
But not even once did he kill him.

1126
01:52:13,233 --> 01:52:15,972
Shankar will kill the demon Bulla.

1127
01:52:16,092 --> 01:52:19,784
I.. I will do one thing.
I will go and hide in such a place..

1128
01:52:19,904 --> 01:52:22,253
...where even Shankar's
shadow cannot reach me.

1129
01:52:22,373 --> 01:52:25,800
Where do I hide?
Yes! In the bathroom.

1130
01:53:12,921 --> 01:53:15,374
No!

1131
01:53:15,493 --> 01:53:17,466
Brother Shankar, no!

1132
01:53:32,233 --> 01:53:33,826
Oh God!

1133
01:53:36,139 --> 01:53:39,670
Brother Shankar, no!

1134
01:53:39,789 --> 01:53:41,216
Shankar, no!

1135
01:53:46,479 --> 01:53:49,854
Brother Shankar..
My name is Chhutiya.

1136
01:53:50,417 --> 01:53:53,104
And I know that you are
going to finish me today.

1137
01:53:53,855 --> 01:53:56,559
Shankar.. please forgive me.
I am not at fault.

1138
01:53:56,679 --> 01:54:00,372
I was not even man enough.
It was he who fed me pills..

1139
01:54:00,492 --> 01:54:01,809
...and made me a man.

1140
01:54:01,929 --> 01:54:03,903
He made me a devil
from a human being.

1141
01:54:04,023 --> 01:54:06,311
Please forgive me! Forgive me!

1142
01:54:07,125 --> 01:54:09,250
You all do not deserve forgiveness.

1143
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:12,359
You were not man enough..

1144
01:54:13,092 --> 01:54:14,715
...now you will
not even remain that.

1145
01:54:14,835 --> 01:54:18,996
No!.. No.. No!

1146
01:54:56,975 --> 01:55:00,569
Chhutiya!.. Chhutiya!

1147
01:55:01,287 --> 01:55:07,849
My brother.. Chhutiya..
What happened to you?

1148
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:14,533
My brother.. What happened?

1149
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:17,782
Chhutiya, even you are dead.

1150
01:55:20,439 --> 01:55:22,298
I did everything for you.

1151
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:27,142
I got pills from London
to make you a man.

1152
01:55:28,893 --> 01:55:32,034
I supplied girls to
you and became a pimp..

1153
01:55:32,909 --> 01:55:34,581
...just so that you became a man.

1154
01:55:35,596 --> 01:55:38,925
And you did become a man Chhutiya.

1155
01:55:39,534 --> 01:55:41,456
And.. I became so happy that day.

1156
01:55:41,877 --> 01:55:44,033
I was very happy, Chhutiya..
Was I not?

1157
01:55:44,643 --> 01:55:49,596
Tell me Chhutiya..
Tell me? I was so happy, right?

1158
01:55:51,426 --> 01:55:55,145
You had just started blooming.

1159
01:55:55,801 --> 01:55:58,551
And Shankar blew your fuse already?

1160
01:56:00,113 --> 01:56:03,186
Why did you go away Chhutiya?
Why did you go away?

1161
01:56:06,984 --> 01:56:10,797
Chhutiya.. Shankar did this to you?

1162
01:56:11,515 --> 01:56:12,671
Shankar did this to you?

1163
01:56:13,384 --> 01:56:17,509
You must have been
in such excruciating pain?

1164
01:56:20,384 --> 01:56:22,993
My name is Bulla!

1165
01:56:23,435 --> 01:56:31,435
Shankar.. I will pierce
you with the knife of death!

1166
01:56:34,230 --> 01:56:36,902
Bulla, I killed your brother Chhutiya.

1167
01:56:38,028 --> 01:56:41,778
If you have guts,
come to the Kali ground..

1168
01:56:42,730 --> 01:56:45,059
...and confront your death.

1169
01:56:45,179 --> 01:56:48,230
The one you killed was Chhutiya..
Not Bulla.

1170
01:56:48,845 --> 01:56:51,658
I am coming. I will come, Shankar.

1171
01:56:52,110 --> 01:56:57,610
My name is Bulla..
I always do everything openly.

1172
01:58:10,670 --> 01:58:15,561
The fire of revenge
has taken an oath..

1173
01:58:17,109 --> 01:58:20,640
...that I will proclaim
bells of your death today!

1174
01:58:23,171 --> 01:58:27,890
Death is first going to visit you.
Only after that will..

1175
01:58:28,344 --> 01:58:32,359
...will there be any
harm done to my hooliganism.

1176
01:58:32,815 --> 01:58:35,784
O enemy of the nation..
Your face will be blackened.

1177
01:58:36,659 --> 01:58:40,519
Today.. Bulla's funeral
will surely take place.

1178
01:58:40,971 --> 01:58:44,315
Funeral..
Before my funeral takes place..

1179
01:58:44,783 --> 01:58:47,909
...I will ensure that your
funeral takes place, Shankar!

1180
01:58:48,029 --> 01:58:53,911
Because my name is Bulla..
And I do everything openly!

1181
02:04:54,854 --> 02:04:58,307
Wait there Shankar!
Or else I will kill your daughter!

1182
02:04:58,587 --> 02:05:00,493
This is not my daughter, Bulla.

1183
02:05:01,198 --> 02:05:04,979
She is Haseena's daughter.
That means, your daughter.

1184
02:05:07,213 --> 02:05:09,885
My blood? My Haseena's sweat?

1185
02:05:11,527 --> 02:05:14,880
Hey Shankar..
I indulge in such deeds everyday..

1186
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,051
...with beautiful women.

1187
02:05:17,488 --> 02:05:19,394
If I accept everyone as daughters..

1188
02:05:19,515 --> 02:05:21,567
...then I'll be a father of
many daughters.

1189
02:05:22,176 --> 02:05:23,787
You are very fond of her,
are you not?

1190
02:05:24,929 --> 02:05:26,710
Here, play with her.

1191
02:07:17,185 --> 02:07:19,216
Hurry up. Get it down.

1192
02:07:20,582 --> 02:07:22,282
Hurry up.

1193
02:08:12,082 --> 02:08:15,617
Your name is Bulla..
And even after your death..

1194
02:08:15,738 --> 02:08:18,547
...your mouth will remain open!

1195
02:08:31,110 --> 02:08:32,693
Bulla!
