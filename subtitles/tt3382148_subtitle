1
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:47,746
"The water's blue..."

2
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,947
"And the day's sunny."

3
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,851
"Come to the beach."

4
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:54,687
"Take a pic of me."

5
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:58,251
"You'll be unlucky if
you didn't listen to me."

6
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:01,864
"The water's blue..."

7
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:05,231
"And the day's sunny."

8
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,937
"Come to the beach."

9
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,802
"Take a pic of me."

10
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:12,537
"You'll be unlucky if
you didn't listen to me."

11
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,282
"Your love..."

12
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:33,928
"It's all I need, sweetheart."

13
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:39,058
"The water's blue..."

14
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,106
"And the day's sunny."

15
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,539
"Come to the beach."

16
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,099
"Take a pic of me."

17
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,841
"You'll be unlucky if
you didn't listen to me."

18
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,095
'Some people call me 'Lota'.

19
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:16,596
'Lo-ta'.

20
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,233
'Someone who's a turn-coat.'

21
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,611
'By the way,
the name's Lakshyaya.'

22
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,738
'If you emphasize,
it's Lakshya.'

23
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,349
'Well,
I like a lot of things.'

24
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,342
'Most of all, my father.'

25
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,584
'He died for his country
when I was just a year old.'

26
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,812
'I always
remember my mother...'

27
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,825
'...giving
tuitions to other kids.'

28
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,288
'She loves her country.'

29
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,251
'But I want
to get out of here.'

30
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:39,922
'To a foreign country.'

31
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,091
'To a life of money,
and fun.'

32
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,927
'They say life teaches
you everything.'

33
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:50,703
'But everything I learnt
in life, was from my friends.'

34
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,376
'From friendship.'

35
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,804
'God is kind.'

36
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,981
'But He takes long if
you ask him for something.'

37
00:03:58,705 --> 00:03:59,683
'Over busy, you know.'

38
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:03,085
'So first take it,
and then apologize.'

39
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,850
'Let him take his time.'

40
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,651
'Me and my friend Debu,
would often buy beer...'

41
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,161
'...from the money we
stole from the temple.'

42
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,598
'But my friendship
with Debu came to a halt...'

43
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,297
'...when Debu went
to Australia for further studies...‘

44
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,360
'...and I landed up
in this college in Sikkim.'

45
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,370
'That day in college
started, just like every day.'

46
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:31,276
'But what happened next
changed everyone's lives.'

47
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,918
Lakshyﬂya!

48
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,195
What are you doing?

49
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,036
Something that never
happened before...

50
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,302
...is going to happen today.

51
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,802
You're going to take
a bath and go to college.

52
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:07,676
The first kiss of my life.

53
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,811
Boy or girl?

54
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,155
You fool, it's Jenny.

55
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,284
Oh!

56
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:15,722
Jenny.

57
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:16,690
Jenny!

58
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,720
"Sexy girl."

59
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,934
Let me watch once, please.

60
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,469
Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! Jenny!

61
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,977
Here, take my watch.

62
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:41,416
Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! Jenny!
- take my goggles

63
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,317
You are Hero...

64
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,184
Move.

65
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,278
Jenny!

66
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,086
Take his deodorant.

67
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,719
Please let me watch. - No way.

68
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,489
I am not that cheap.

69
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,163
Who are you to watch me kiss?

70
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,458
My Jenny.

71
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,199
My Canadian Jenny.

72
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,201
Your lpod.

73
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,104
If you give me that,
then I might think about it.

74
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,436
Okay, done.

75
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,388
"Sexy girl."

76
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,055
Sandy. Training class can wait.

77
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,793
I've my practical today.

78
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,728
Jenny.

79
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,769
"Sexy girl."

80
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,976
Life's first kiss.

81
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,009
But do you love Jenny.

82
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,010
Idiot! - I don't know, buddy.
I don't know.

83
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:43,843
I don't know?

84
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,448
Kiss without falling in love.

85
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,546
This is lust.

86
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,177
What's it called in Hindi?

87
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,343
'Vaasna' (lust).

88
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,255
Craving!

89
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,982
It sounds so vulgar.

90
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,990
English is better.

91
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,182
It's lust.

92
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:56,886
It's lust.

93
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:57,984
Hormone complication.

94
00:06:58,818 --> 00:06:59,353
Hormone...

95
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,321
Hello, ma'am.

96
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,899
Sorry. Hello, ma'am.

97
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,361
Thank you God... for
making hormones.

98
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,529
Otherwise... life would've
been so boring.

99
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,068
What?

100
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,539
Hey!

101
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,072
How dare you enter the
girl's hostel? - Sorry, ma'am.

102
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,577
Aunt! Aunt! Aunt! - Sorry? Go now.

103
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:18,373
Aunt! Aunt!

104
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,314
Give me blessings, aunt.

105
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,350
I am going on a mission.

106
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,209
Naughty, shameless.

107
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,310
I am not your aunt.

108
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,787
I am the girl's hostel warden.

109
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:25,546
Get that!

110
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:28,392
Debu.

111
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:29,223
Talk to him.

112
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,455
Ask him to come home soon.
Tell him.

113
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:32,894
Bro!

114
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,464
Hey, Debu. What's up?

115
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,223
Your brother's always perfect.

116
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:36,890
You say.

117
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,229
First tell me,
how's it going in Australia?

118
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,062
<i>Class.</i>

119
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,603
Listen, no need to come to India.

120
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,408
It's filled with heat, mosquitoes
and boring life, nothing else.

121
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,034
I see.

122
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,009
That's the advice you're
giving your childhood friend.

123
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,909
I will tell your mom.
I swear. - Aunt...

124
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,376
...please give your blessing.

125
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,472
It's an important mission.

126
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,212
Go, may you be successful
in your mission.

127
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,851
Thank you, aunt. Bye.

128
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,179
By the way,
what's your mission?

129
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,621
Kiss. - I see.

130
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:03,554
What?

131
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,926
"Sexy girl."

132
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:09,895
"Sexy girl."

133
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:10,900
Jenny.

134
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:15,237
"All I really want
is to hold you tight."

135
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:19,003
"All I need
is you by my side."

136
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,504
Promise me you're going
to tell me all the details.

137
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,639
Shut up!

138
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,622
"All I really want..."

139
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,589
"All I really...

140
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,964
Hail to the Almighty.

141
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,471
Have you finished kissing?

142
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,378
Oh no, I missed it!

143
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,844
What the...

144
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,143
Principal...

145
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,250
Good morning to you, sir.

146
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,287
Bad morning for me, sir.

147
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,024
Sir...

148
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,063
Sir... she's a family friend.

149
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:58,892
Her mother asked me to...

150
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,006
Actually... we're cousins, sir.

151
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,102
Sir, she had a toothache.

152
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,775
I was just checking.

153
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,939
Sir... I Will
definitely marry her.

154
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:12,976
Sorry, sir.

155
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,784
I cannot lie anymore.

156
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,217
Let me do it, sir.

157
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,757
It's my first kiss.

158
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:30,961
What's wrong
with the principal?

159
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,430
Somethings wrong.

160
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,174
I am sorry! I am sorry!

161
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,469
Please.

162
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,976
Whatever happened yesterday
was just an accident.

163
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,477
Please. Please. Please.
I am sorry.

164
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,341
Alright,
but don't you mess up this time.

165
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,504
Okay? - Yes.

166
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,808
Tomorrow evening,
Annual Function.

167
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:49,817
Backstage.

168
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,149
"Sexy girl."

169
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,156
Yes.

170
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:57,155
There's a battle raging
between India and Pakistan.

171
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,427
The Indian soldiers...

172
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,964
...are protecting their country
by sacrificing their lives.

173
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,345
Oh, Lord!

174
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,245
Boy,
didn't you go watch the play?

175
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,246
It's at 4 o'clock,
uncle. - No.

176
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:20,875
3 o'clock.

177
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,942
3 Pm - What?

178
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,125
You got me in a mess.

179
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,286
How will we get to college now?

180
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,894
Hi, guys.
- Neil, my brother, my friend.

181
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,093
Come on.

182
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,139
What the hell!

183
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,265
Where is he?

184
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,970
But, how will
you get to the stage?

185
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,741
I guess God made friends
when He was making hormones.

186
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,941
Jia. She will
open the door for us.

187
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,276
Thanks so much. - Thanks.

188
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,115
Chill, dude. - Bye.

189
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:56,983
BYE, bye.

190
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,254
Carefully.

191
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,722
I just want it once.

192
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:06,988
What are you doing?

193
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:07,961
Hey!

194
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,164
Relax, guys.

195
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,229
I'll do everyone.

196
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,994
One by one.

197
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:15,338
Wait.

198
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,341
Which one of your
dad has a Mercedes?

199
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:19,333
I have...

200
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,608
You first.

201
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,114
Go.

202
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,738
Go fast, go fast.

203
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:26,815
Hurry UP-

204
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,351
The sayings right.

205
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,655
Before you find
your Prince Charming...

206
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,288
...one has to kiss lot of frogs.

207
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,099
Oh, God!

208
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,435
Where were you, stupid?

209
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,640
She is waiting.

210
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,007
Thanks...

211
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:57,707
You?

212
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,747
Hi. - You out.

213
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,440
No, please.
I've a deal with him.

214
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,242
Get out. - Please.

215
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,096
"Sexy Girl."

216
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,467
Oh my God!

217
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,006
Oh my God!

218
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,041
Where's Jenny the Mother India?

219
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,739
I don't have time.

220
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:41,486
Jia.

221
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,788
Please... save my honour.

222
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,427
Be a mother for me. - Mother.

223
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,763
But who is the Pa?

224
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,270
I mean Mother India.

225
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,281
Mother!

226
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,416
<i>Go, Ma. Go!</i>

227
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,682
Your wounded sons
are waiting for you.

228
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:15,982
SOn!

229
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,159
Mother.

230
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,695
SOn!

231
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:25,665
Oh, God!

232
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,175
SOn!

233
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,674
Mother, you're here?
- Yes, son.

234
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,952
Mother, sing me a lullaby.

235
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,377
Son, I don't know a lullaby.

236
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,014
Sing anything, Mother.

237
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,159
"My name is Sheila."

238
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,456
"Sheila's bold youth."

239
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,392
"I'm too sexy for you."

240
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,224
"You can't
get your hands on me."

241
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,291
"My name is Sheila."

242
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,429
"Sheila's bold youth."

243
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,700
"I'm too sexy for you."

244
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,140
"You can't
get your hands on me."

245
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,907
"We crave like it's been ages."

246
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,073
Mom!

247
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,006
Someone save us!

248
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:15,708
Daddy.

249
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,082
Give us a hug, mother.

250
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,791
You're the enemy.

251
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:26,794
We don't want India.

252
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,399
We just want a hug.

253
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,525
Just take us in your arms.

254
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,295
No, never.

255
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,167
Mother! Mother! Mother!

256
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,841
Come under my refuge.

257
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,235
I will protect you. - Okay.

258
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,009
Soldiers, act dead...

259
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,177
...or the principal
will kill me.

260
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,189
Just go and die.

261
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,518
Help!

262
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:57,952
Please.

263
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,494
Mom!

264
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,839
I am sorry. Please, please...

265
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,075
Good for you.

266
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,615
Not concentrate
on your studies.

267
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,418
And these things are worthless.

268
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:29,754
My loom.

269
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,684
Don't worry.

270
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:35,554
There's another hormone for it.

271
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,456
'Sang-Dosh' hormone.

272
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,565
Because now you're
not going to find...

273
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,069
...your type of girlfriend
in this college.

274
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,928
I mean your fantasy girl.

275
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,638
36-24-36 types.

276
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:46,933
Stupid...

277
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,970
You know what your problem is.

278
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,114
You believe in
100 meters sprint.

279
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,150
I mean, relationships
are like a marathon.

280
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:54,449
Look who's talking.

281
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,551
Sprint-queen. - Guys.

282
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,079
I may have lost the battle,
but not the war.

283
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:03,787
If I don't woo a hot,
sexy girl in the next 30 days...

284
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,787
...then I'll polish
your shoes every day.,

285
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,089
Deal?

286
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:07,720
Deal.

287
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:15,230
Do you know, half of the college
students are being rusticated.

288
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,004
And after what happened today.

289
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,702
Lakshyaya, you're doomed.
- What?

290
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:20,773
What?

291
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:21,610
What?

292
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,204
The news <i>is</i> half of our college
students are being rusticated.

293
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,005
But why?

294
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,983
Forget why, think about
who's going to be rusticated.

295
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:33,884
Throw them out!

296
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,783
Throw the college girls out.

297
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,726
Throw the hot-dressers out!

298
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,660
They've turned our college
into so village-school.

299
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,665
The boys are always
looking at their legs.

300
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,564
They don't look
at the other options.

301
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,601
Boys college.

302
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,569
Muscular college.

303
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,766
It's our duty
that we do something.

304
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:52,671
But...

305
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,569
Get it out. - What?

306
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:55,477
But...

307
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:56,911
Your feelings.

308
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,745
Teachers.

309
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,046
I have decided.

310
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,783
Rusticating all of you...

311
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,652
...wou
d definitely
be the right decision.

312
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,595
But I have something
more challenging...

313
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,497
...for all of you.

314
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,030
As you all know,
our college...

315
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,870
...isn't just constructed on
the grounds of his royal highness.

316
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,840
In fact, many years
ago he started this college.

317
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,577
Few days,
the crown prince has signed a deal.

318
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:36,644
Play ground, auditorium
and girl's hostel portions...

319
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:41,087
...have been sold to an
Australian businessman Rockefeller.

320
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,823
And Mr. Rockefeller...

321
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,254
...wants to construct a hotel
and a casino on these grounds.

322
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,697
When I told Mr.
Rockefeller...

323
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,900
A casino and a hotel next
to a learning institution.

324
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,743
This is a bad idea.

325
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,242
It Will
be a bad influence.

326
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,544
Well he said.

327
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,141
Indian students are
only interested in studies.

328
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,617
They've no interest
in culture, sports.

329
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:12,883
They have no interest.

330
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,819
I said, Mr.
Fella, you're wrong.

331
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,723
So he threw a challenge.

332
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,960
If the students
of our college...

333
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,761
“manage to defeat
the Australian students...

334
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,997
...in sports
and cultural events.

335
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:33,241
Then he'll extend the
lease on that land for 100 years.

336
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,644
And I have
accepted that challenge.

337
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,611
You five have
to save this college.

338
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,215
There are just
four of us. - Yes.

339
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,354
Who's the fifth one?

340
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,294
You don't understand, Mr.
Pandey...

341
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,298
How romantic.

342
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,199
Learn something.

343
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,869
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

344
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:53,215
I guess your father
owns a jasmine oil factory.

345
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,991
That's why you've
applied so much of it.

346
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,559
Who me? - Yes, you.

347
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,127
No, no.

348
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,024
This is 'Am
a'
(lndian-gooseberry) oil.

349
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,893
I see. Good for you.

350
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:07,829
Have you met the fifth
member of your team or not?

351
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,137
Hi.

352
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,133
Saloni.

353
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:13,936
Her?

354
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,006
Which competition
is she going to win?

355
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,541
She will win all
the competitions. - Yes.

356
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:19,274
H ow?

357
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,678
When she applies that oil...

358
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,784
...the smell will make
the Australian team run away.

359
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,352
Hey, guys.

360
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,285
Any problem?
- No, ma'am.

361
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:30,555
No problem at all.

362
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:31,855
All fine, ma'am. - Okay.

363
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,561
Sir, these five cannot do anything.

364
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,329
Why don't we call
students from outside...

365
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,036
...and pretend that
they are our students...

366
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,796
Pardon me, sir.

367
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,967
But what made you
select these five, sir.

368
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,747
Neil. Local boy.

369
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,247
A big zero in his studies.

370
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,319
All he does is drive
his bike all day.

371
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,227
No one knows better than Neil...

372
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,594
...what a bike can do.

373
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:19,835
Sir. Jia.

374
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,345
She's the daughter of a ﬂop star.

375
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:28,608
Mrs. Dogra.
She's seen her mother fail.

376
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,909
She understands
the pain of failure.

377
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,020
Sir, Pardy.

378
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,151
It's the same story all over again.

379
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,417
Local boy.

380
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,160
The son of a musical
instrument repairer.

381
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:40,161
Pardy.

382
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:41,890
Interesting character.

383
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,327
He loves the drums.

384
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,311
And that will be an asset.

385
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,144
Saloni.

386
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,915
The daughter of a retired teacher.

387
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,280
Her memory's sharper
than a computer.

388
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:09,418
Lakshyaya.

389
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,987
The same story again.

390
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,728
His mother gives tuitions
to pay for his education.

391
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:17,123
And he's lazy, and most irresponsible.

392
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,226
He's my captain.

393
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:20,928
Baby!

394
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,205
Somebody save her please.

395
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,107
It's Okay don't cry...

396
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:31,738
So sunny.

397
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,321
Look there Lakshyaya.

398
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,265
Lakshya! Lakshya!

399
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,142
Lakshya! Lakshya!

400
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,677
Lakshya! Lakshya!

401
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:36,968
Come on, Lakshya!

402
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:40,581
Lakshya! Lakshya! Lakshya! Lakshya!

403
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:46,021
Lakshya! Lakshya! Lakshya! Lakshya!

404
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,847
My baby.

405
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,785
Tomorrow first period, library.

406
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,857
How did you climb up there?

407
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:30,626
Aunt.

408
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,666
First I stepped on that,
then that and then that...

409
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,704
...and climbed up. - I see.

410
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:35,496
Sir...

411
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,972
Lakshyaya has no
leadership qualities.

412
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:38,767
Take a look.

413
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,738
Mr. Pandey,
I think you're forgetting...

414
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,010
...who Lakshyayds dad was.

415
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,843
If we lose the girl's hostel...

416
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,711
...then what's the point of living?

417
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,021
Where there's life,
there are dreams.

418
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,046
Where there are dreams,
there are girls.

419
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,088
Where there are girls,
there's hope.

420
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:57,651
We'll find someone somewhere.

421
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:58,888
Everyone will find one.

422
00:26:59,017 --> 00:26:59,995
"Party girl"

423
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:03,191
"Party all night"

424
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:06,161
"Party all night" - Guys,
just grow up!

425
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,096
It's not just about
the girl's hostel.

426
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:15,073
It's about our college,
our country, our self-respect.

427
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,802
At every event in life...

428
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,145
...people will definitely ask you
which college are you from?

429
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,650
This college is our identity.

430
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,988
Will we let those foreigners
seize this college?

431
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,151
No, we won't!

432
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,992
Three cheers for Lakshya!

433
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,586
Hip-hip hurray!

434
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:34,958
Hip-hip hurray!

435
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,328
Hip-hip hurray!

436
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:37,658
Hip-hip hurray!

437
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,598
We'll fight till the last drop
of our blood.

438
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,696
We'll fight till the
last drop of our blood.

439
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,708
But we will defeat
these foreigners!

440
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,971
We will defeat them!
We will defeat them!

441
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,376
Hip-hip hurray!

442
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,103
Hip-hip hurray!

443
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:53,044
ls this a blood-donation camp?

444
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,650
Where we'll donate blood.

445
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,215
And is it easy to defeat the
Australians in sports and culture?

446
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,191
Relax. Relax.

447
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,054
We're not going to fight
the competition.

448
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,263
But the speech?

449
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:13,665
I gave that speech because
girls like that stuff.

450
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,829
By doing this, no one can stop us
from entering the girl's hostel.

451
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:18,670
But, one thing?

452
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,175
You don't have a girlfriend
any more in the girl's hostel.

453
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,467
Then who will you go meet there?

454
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,345
I don't, but I will have one.

455
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,805
Let's plan for the competition now.

456
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,675
We will. What's the hurry?

457
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,288
Tonight there's a pyjama
party at the hostel.

458
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,287
Just you five are invited.

459
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,890
Because you're trying so
hard to save our hostel.

460
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,094
Here's the invite.

461
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,323
Don't forget it this time.

462
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,695
Leave me. - You always pounce
at the first opportunity.

463
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,869
Check the entire package first.

464
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,009
Why are you girls so judgmental?

465
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,940
Don't you girls talk about
boys in the same way?

466
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,219
There are other things in life to
talk about besides boys and girls.

467
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,821
Whatever it is,
keep it to yourself.

468
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,358
What was that you just said? - Sit.

469
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,852
Tell me...how many girls in
the girls hostel?

470
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,029
160 girls. Yeah!

471
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:20,032
160 girls for 3 boys.

472
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,795
What's the ratio? - 53.333!

473
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,931
She's right.

474
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,269
But I didn't get it.

475
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,306
53.33 girls.

476
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,409
Will I have to deal with all
of them in one night?

477
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:31,880
Pardy!

478
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:40,945
Okay, mom. I am leaving.

479
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:41,847
Wait...

480
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:42,653
Where are you going?

481
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,794
5 days a week you
spend at the hostel.

482
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,054
Only saturdays and Sundays are all
you get to spend at home.

483
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,895
Mother, I've to complete an
important college project.

484
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,360
Otherwise I would've
definitely stayed back.

485
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:53,260
Look after yourself.

486
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,927
What do you mean by
"Look after yourself".

487
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,833
Even the thieves know...

488
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,306
...this is Brigadier
Amar Singh's home.

489
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,111
Mother, if he had taken up
a corporate life instead...

490
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,710
...then you wouldn't be
giving tuitions now.

491
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,982
But no, he wanted to be a hero...

492
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,674
...so he sacrificed his
life for the country.

493
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,244
Someday you will realize...

494
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,923
...why does anyone give his
life for his country.

495
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,956
Mother, I am getting late. Bye.

496
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:16,890
Hold on.

497
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:21,288
My... - You will get your
papa's goggles...

498
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,990
...only when you're worthy of them.

499
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:24,892
Get it. - Mother.

500
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,161
You're getting late no, aren't you?

501
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,032
Go!

502
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,437
Hello, uncle. - Hello.

503
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,744
Uncle, I'm here to pick up Saloni.

504
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,404
Why?

505
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,237
For the night-long
veneration, uncle.

506
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:42,207
Veneration? In Sikkim?

507
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,281
Actually, a Pandit family just
shifted here from Beneras.

508
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:47,785
Listen.

509
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,782
Are there going to
be any boys? - Boys?

510
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,895
No, uncle just three boys.

511
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,830
One will play the clarinet.

512
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,797
"We will win."

513
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,061
The second will play the drums.

514
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,396
"We will win."

515
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,733
And the third will sing discourses.

516
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,099
"We will win one day."

517
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,901
Please, papa. Please.

518
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:08,142
Okay, okay.

519
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,004
But, listen.

520
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,210
Bring her back home
on time in the morning.

521
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,874
Sure, uncle. Thanks, uncle.

522
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,444
"There's going to
be an uproar tonight."

523
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,120
"When the moon shines."

524
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,085
"Forget the suits."

525
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,147
"Just wear a pair of pyjamas."

526
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,989
"Our friendship..."

527
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,426
"Fresh and crisp."

528
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:30,230
"Now's the chance,
forget the world."

529
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,994
"Play the music."

530
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,726
"And start the party."

531
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,164
"Don't care about the world..."

532
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,002
"No responsibilities."

533
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:39,941
"What boy."

534
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:41,866
"What girl."

535
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,913
"Say everybodymsay..."

536
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,207
"There is me."

537
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:48,813
"There is you."

538
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,787
"So let's start the pyjama party."

539
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,447
"Come on. Come on."

540
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,286
"Don't be so arrogant."

541
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,223
"Scream and shout."

542
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,057
"And let the booze flow."

543
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,790
"Come on. Come on."

544
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,388
"Don't be so arrogant."

545
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,194
"Scream and shout."

546
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,132
"And let the booze flow."

547
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,784
"A little smart."

548
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,829
"More insane."

549
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:38,894
"We can turn lectures into
a Dirty Picture."

550
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,961
"The naughtier, more the chances."

551
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,001
"Turn the college campus
into a rocking disco."

552
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,342
"I swear..."

553
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:52,407
"We're the world."

554
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,142
"There is me."

555
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:57,283
"There is you."

556
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,222
"So let's start the pyjama party."

557
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,985
"Come on. Come on."

558
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,821
"Don't be so arrogant."

559
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,485
"Scream and shout."

560
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,530
"And let the booze flow."

561
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,155
"Come on. Come on."

562
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,063
"Don't be so arrogant."

563
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,601
"Scream and shout."

564
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,494
"And let the booze flow."

565
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,429
"There's going to
be an uproar tonight."

566
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,167
"When the moon shines."

567
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,071
"Forget the suits."

568
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,008
"Just wear a pair of pyjamas."

569
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,544
"Pyjama loose-loose."

570
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,410
"Better get the men some booze."

571
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,105
"There's a buffet of girls."

572
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,114
"You may choose."

573
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,345
"One or two."

574
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,387
"Two or three."

575
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:36,047
"Who am I going to choose,
everyone's so beautiful."

576
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:39,527
"I wonder what these girls
are going to make me do."

577
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,860
"My astrologer says..."

578
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,921
"...girls are going
to get you killed."

579
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,033
"There is me."

580
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,026
"There is you."

581
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,628
"So let's start the pyjama party."

582
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,432
"Come on. Come on."

583
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,272
"Don't be so arrogant."

584
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,073
"Scream and shout."

585
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,636
"And let the booze flow."

586
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,880
"Come on. Come on."

587
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,507
"Don't be so arrogant."

588
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,347
"Scream and shout."

589
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,081
"And let the booze flow."

590
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,034
Jenny.

591
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:30,539
I want to kiss you.

592
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:33,441
<i>Kiss me.</i>

593
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:37,784
Cockroach!

594
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,879
Cockroach! Cockroach!

595
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,890
Cockroach! Cockroach!

596
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,427
Save me! Cockroach!

597
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,056
Baby. - Someone please, help me.

598
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,120
Somebody help.

599
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,795
Cockroach! Cockroach!

600
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,130
Someone save me!

601
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,292
Cockroach!

602
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:55,768
Baby.

603
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,365
Baby, are you okay?

604
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,139
Mouse.

605
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:01,472
Cockroach! It's on my leg.

606
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,137
Someone get it off.
- Cockroach, baby! No mouse.

607
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,954
We can never befriends.

608
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,845
I never said so.

609
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,318
And anyway, to be friends...

610
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,427
...there should be more than
53.33 topics to talk about.

611
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,360
Like?

612
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:21,886
Like?

613
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,299
Do you know,
there's a new Intel chip...

614
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,992
...that's been launched
in the market.

615
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,195
With high configuration.

616
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,133
Multiple-core processor.

617
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:31,566
SSD drive.

618
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:36,275
DDR 3...Random Access Memory.
Display Card.

619
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,913
Folders, file management...

620
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,018
What happened?

621
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:46,320
Scared of her.

622
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,318
She's such a bore.

623
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,053
I've a cure.

624
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:57,957
Give her booze.

625
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:58,864
For friendship.

626
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,229
I don't drink.

627
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,871
This is cranberry juice.

628
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,876
In friendship you
should have trust.

629
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,207
Cranberry? - Yes.

630
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,206
Are you sure. - Yes.

631
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:32,259
You said...you're my friend.

632
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,134
Trust me. - Yes.

633
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,964
And I trusted you...

634
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,202
...and you gave me booze?
- Who did that?

635
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,010
You did, didn't you?

636
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:43,706
Don't lie.

637
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:47,181
You gave me booze, get that.

638
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,886
You're no Casanova.

639
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,287
This cute face.

640
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,090
What do you think?

641
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,924
These girls...

642
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,894
Them...

643
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,222
They're crazy about you?

644
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:04,760
They will die for you? - Yes.

645
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,200
But I am not like them.

646
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,861
I am different.

647
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,201
You...can never be like one of them.

648
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,104
Why?

649
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,043
Because...you're a gigabyte.

650
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,312
You're a terabyte.

651
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,006
"Do you know,
there's a new Intel chip..."

652
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,311
"...that's been launched
in the market."

653
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:22,917
Burden.

654
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,279
'Saloni was drunk, so was Jia.'

655
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:26,988
'I caught arrow by the teeth...'

656
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,216
'...so I had to face
the consequences.'

657
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,926
'How will we drop her home?'

658
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:33,359
'Her dad hates boys.'

659
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,825
'Well, we didn't
have any other option.'

660
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,798
'So we had to use apples.'

661
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,494
What's wrong with her?

662
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,303
Uncle, she got the fits.

663
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:45,499
That's how she is.

664
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:46,841
She's a very religious person.

665
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:47,841
Yes, uncle.

666
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:49,408
Come, dear.

667
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,808
Okay, uncle. Bye.

668
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:51,403
Take care. - Thank you.

669
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,243
Wait!

670
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:55,882
Why does your voice sound manly?

671
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,317
We sang the discourses.

672
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,384
So we got a sore throat. - Yeah!

673
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,161
Which discourses, dear?

674
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:19,003
"Glory to Goddess."

675
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,236
"All say... - Glory to Goddess."

676
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:27,572
What's this, dear?

677
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:29,918
The Goddess' boon.

678
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,513
Hail Goddess.

679
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,351
The Goddess' boon.

680
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,388
Hail Goddess.

681
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:36,354
Hail Goddess.

682
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,361
Hey!

683
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,191
What are we going to do...

684
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,996
...with the practice
money we'll get?

685
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,230
We'll party, what else?

686
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,802
Party's everything for you, right?

687
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,346
Everyone in Sikkim respects
your father so much.

688
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:01,977
He sacrificed his life at
Red Peak for his country.

689
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,449
But he didn't let the ﬂag fall.

690
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,885
And you... - So?

691
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,354
What did the country do for him?

692
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:10,391
Come on, Lakshya.

693
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,895
Why are you so bitter about
your father's sacrifice?

694
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,297
Anyone can...
- Stop this bookish language.

695
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:17,029
He was in the army.

696
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:18,865
Fighting and winning
the war was his duty.

697
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:19,897
Not mine.

698
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:20,865
Excuse me.

699
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:24,232
Our duty is what
we're getting paid for.

700
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,968
Listen you C++ gigabyte.

701
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,843
Have you lost your brains?

702
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,342
Listen, guys. Saloni isn't wrong.

703
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,041
We must practice.

704
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,384
Okay, guys. I am sorry.

705
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:39,283
For the next 7-8 days we're
going to practice rigorously...

706
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,580
...and everyone will think
we're serious about this.

707
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,121
Cool!

708
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,523
Okay. - Come on, let's practice.

709
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:45,356
Come on.

710
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,098
By the way, why don't
you join Anna sir?

711
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,403
The competition starts in 10 days.

712
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,848
The competition is in two parts.

713
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:40,982
Pan one will be...

714
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,345
Rock competition,
chess competition...

715
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:44,681
...and motorbike race.

716
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,146
And part two will be...

717
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,018
Cycle race, mountain climbing.

718
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,987
Ready, sir. - Excellent.

719
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,491
By the way, when are the
Australians arriving?

720
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,023
The Australians aren't coming here.

721
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,191
You are all going to Australia.

722
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:01,494
Mr. Pandey.

723
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,240
I was always yours,
and forever will be.

724
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,234
I promise.

725
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,243
Even if Salman Khan asks me...

726
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,704
<i>...l</i> won't let him touch me.

727
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:12,946
Promise!

728
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,376
But why will he touch you?

729
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,408
Let's go, Mr. Pandey.
- Because I am so hot.

730
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,748
Yes.

731
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:21,512
Bye.

732
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:26,793
Hello.

733
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:28,863
The other day when you were drunk...

734
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:30,458
...you said you liked me.

735
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:32,797
Never.

736
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:33,924
I cannot say such a thing.

737
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:35,361
Why?

738
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,330
What's wrong with me?

739
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,238
You...are a 'Lota'.

740
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:42,808
'Lota.'

741
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:44,503
'Lota?'

742
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:45,970
All the best.

743
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:49,081
At last you found
the one you deserved.

744
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,309
You just wait and watch.

745
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,881
The entire college will watch
my next girlfriend with awe.

746
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:54,853
Really?

747
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:56,280
Loser.

748
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,415
Hey. - Hello, sir.

749
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,962
The biggest humiliation in life...

750
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,993
...is when someone
insults your country.

751
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:06,829
And the biggest happiness...

752
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:11,230
...when your country's ﬂag,
is fluttering proudly.

753
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,779
This is our country's ﬂag.

754
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:22,940
Don't let be insulted.

755
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:36,594
Mr. Rockefeller.

756
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,095
Indian team is coming.

757
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:40,461
We're waiting.

758
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,625
Welcome to Australia, bro.

759
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:13,666
Dude.

760
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,571
Who told you we're here?

761
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,866
You didn't tell me, but mom did.

762
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,265
Guys, he's Debu.

763
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:22,834
Hi. - My aunt's son.

764
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,202
Hello. - Hi. Debu.

765
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,276
Do you drive a taxi here?
- Yes, part time.

766
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,876
By the way, I'm doing
an advance course in IT.

767
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:31,912
Okay-

768
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,922
If you've finished chit-chatting,
tell me something.

769
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:36,120
Will you take me to
Rockefeller College or not?

770
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,091
No. - Why?

771
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,086
My dear brother.

772
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:42,860
As long as you all are here...

773
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:45,589
<i>...l</i> am not leaving you
all alone for a minute.

774
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,972
'When destiny smiles,
it knows no boundary.'

775
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:54,400
'I didn't expect to find
my dream-girl in Australia'.

776
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:56,335
'But that's where I found her.'

777
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,403
‘The Australian team member.
Jeanette .'

778
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,247
'She saw me. And I saw her.'

779
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,713
'That moment I got the indication.'

780
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,086
'That she's the one.'

781
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,785
'The Rajdhani express.
The shortcut of all shortcuts.'

782
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:12,383
'Straight to the point.'

783
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,387
'Jeanette .'

784
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:14,795
Saloni. - Shawn.

785
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:15,886
Neil. - Mike.

786
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,225
<i>Ma. - Cooper.</i>

787
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,628
Pardy. - Elizabeth.

788
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,996
Hi. I am Lakshya.
- Hi, I am Jeanette.

789
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,737
Hey. - HEY-

790
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:25,840
Don't eat too much, fatso.

791
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:29,206
I was wondering since long?

792
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:31,271
Aren't you Debu from B-21? - Yes.

793
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:33,137
You didn't send
me my Rakhi money yet.

794
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:34,273
Don't say that, I did.

795
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,078
You lier. ..

796
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,675
Give me some money.

797
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,082
Rascal. When are
you going to grow-up?

798
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,384
I don't like this English food.

799
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,961
<i>L...l</i> can smell stuffed-bread.

800
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,864
Nikki's coming along with
the stuffed bread.

801
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,037
ls someone remember about you, sir?

802
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,472
Remembering...

803
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:16,890
Here you go.

804
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,483
Eat all you want.

805
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:21,159
Stuffed bread.

806
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:27,458
How is it? - It's hot.

807
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:39,478
Let go.

808
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,373
Leave some for the
students <i>as</i> well. - No.

809
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:42,917
They already ate english food.

810
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:43,951
Let me eat.

811
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,983
Please. - Look, this is mine.

812
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:46,851
Look...

813
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:56,554
You...you... - Introduction?

814
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,525
I am Nikki Mahajan.

815
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,401
I teach biology in this college.

816
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:06,168
Are you married? - No.

817
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,178
In fact,
I am waiting for a good suitor.

818
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:11,478
Me too.

819
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:14,177
Are you waiting for a boy too?

820
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:15,773
No, no.

821
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,418
For a nice...girl.

822
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,081
Someone who can make
delicious stuffed-bread.

823
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,291
'Nikki ma'am took care of
Pandey sir's hormonal imbalance.'

824
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:26,024
'On the other hand,
I was floored by Jeanette .'

825
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:29,058
'But we didn't expect that,
Rockefeller...'

826
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,393
<i>'...would organize</i> a party,
<i>so that we...'</i>

827
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,798
'...get to know the
Australian team better.'

828
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,026
'He said look around,
party and have a blast.'

829
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:37,361
'And there was Jeanette .'

830
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:41,034
"The water's blue..."

831
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:44,407
"And the day's sunny."

832
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,573
"Come to the beach."

833
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,010
"Take a pic of me."

834
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:51,518
"You'll be unlucky if
you didn't listen to me."

835
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:55,216
"The water's blue..."

836
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,590
"And the day's sunny."

837
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,352
"Come to the beach."

838
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,260
"Take a pic of me."

839
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,960
"You'll be unlucky
if you didn't listen to me."

840
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,839
"Let it be sunset time."

841
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,680
"And the cool sand."

842
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,913
"Let's go to party,
I cannot wait any more."

843
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:30,917
"Stan the party,
we're already late."

844
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,858
"Just hand me a bottle,
and I don't care."

845
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:37,729
"The water's blue..."

846
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,928
"And the day's sunny."

847
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,732
"Come to the beach."

848
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,636
"Take a pic of me."

849
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,972
"You'll be unlucky
if you didn't listen to me."

850
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:51,772
"The water's blue..."

851
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:55,078
"And the day's sunny."

852
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,015
"Come to the beach."

853
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:58,849
"Take a pic of me."

854
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:02,356
"You'll be unlucky
if you didn't listen to me."

855
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,020
You're such a rascal.

856
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:07,354
You know Hindi?

857
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,397
Mom's an Australian,
and dad's India.

858
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,740
"Your love..."

859
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:25,643
"It's all I need, sweetheart."

860
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:32,051
"Just you and me and
the sound of the waves."

861
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:35,749
"Come in my arms,
girl what are you waiting for."

862
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:39,191
"I'll take you on a huge yacht."

863
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:42,025
"We'll we drunk on Malibu shots."

864
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:45,760
"The water's blue..."

865
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:49,201
"And the day's sunny."

866
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,829
"Come to the beach."

867
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:52,805
"Take a pic of me."

868
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:56,436
"You'll be unlucky
if you didn't listen to me."

869
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:36,284
Friends always make
a fool out of you.

870
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,980
Friends give you booze
saying its cold drink.

871
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,818
Friends introduce you to aunties...

872
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:43,755
...calling them their girlfriend.

873
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,587
No matter how scoundrel they are...

874
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:49,292
...but we miss friends a lot.

875
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,230
Debu.

876
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,260
I miss you, buddy.

877
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:01,175
Aunt really misses you.

878
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,079
I miss you all too.

879
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,374
Specially, mom.

880
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:12,819
Lakshyaya,
did you take your passport?

881
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,014
Here's ginger powder.

882
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,078
Take it after dinner.

883
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:17,625
And here's your pocket
expense, for Australia.

884
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:23,129
What's this, mom?

885
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,889
Rs. 15,000?

886
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,065
I'm going to Australia,
not Pahadganj.

887
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:29,726
Son, that's all I have right now.

888
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:30,838
What's this, mom?

889
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:33,272
You never have money for me.

890
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,744
I don't care.
I want 50,000 right now.

891
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,078
You always get me humiliated.

892
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,113
Son, papa's pension
hasn't arrived yet...

893
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:43,742
When in need, there's neither
papa nor his pension.

894
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:45,978
I'll leave forever.

895
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:47,917
I'll settle down in Australia.

896
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,217
And never come back again.

897
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:51,817
You'll yearn to see my face.

898
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:53,025
I am leaving.

899
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:56,653
Lakshyaya. Wait, son.

900
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:58,091
Such anger.

901
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,262
Won't you even say bye.

902
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:05,434
I wonder why,
but every conversation...

903
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:07,107
...with mom turns into an argument.

904
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:10,972
I guess because there's
no referee between us...

905
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,907
...who can stop the fight.

906
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:16,011
Even I have had arguments.

907
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:17,147
Since I was a kid.

908
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:18,145
Yes.

909
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,410
But I already told mom.

910
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,780
I'll go to a foreign land.

911
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,888
Earn lots of money.

912
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,759
And I won't let you do this job.

913
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:28,761
Forget it.

914
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:30,290
The competition's tomorrow.

915
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,421
Let's concentrate on that.

916
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,299
Yes. - Cheers.

917
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,069
Yes.

918
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:38,503
Okay, okay, can I have
your attention please?

919
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:42,033
Alright people, so are you excited?

920
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,300
Yeah!

921
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:44,775
Okay-

922
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:48,210
So let's welcome
the Australian band.

923
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:58,355
We shouldn't have drunk so much?

924
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,385
You're right.

925
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:25,979
Hey! That's our song!

926
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,180
That day at the guest house...

927
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,786
...when we were doing practice.

928
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:33,121
I felt someone was overhearing us.

929
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:33,991
Oh no!

930
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,456
It's impossible to ready
another song so quickly.

931
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:37,763
What will we do now?

932
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:38,865
What do you mean?

933
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,431
This is clearly cheating.

934
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,170
Okay, relax.

935
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:47,106
I'll go and talk to them.
- No, Debu. You wait.

936
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:48,340
I'll go talk to them.

937
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:50,210
But Lakshyaya...

938
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:10,388
Sir, please.

939
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,231
They said these are the rules.

940
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:14,825
We shou
d've informed them earlier

941
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,165
...what song we're going to sing.

942
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,498
But while we were partying around...

943
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,132
...we forgot to inform them.

944
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:23,334
We made a mistake,
but what do we do now?

945
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,004
What mistake?

946
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,378
This is cheating, get that?

947
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,484
I'll talk to them. - Debu.

948
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:38,486
Sir, you're not getting it.

949
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:40,026
This is our song.

950
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:42,792
They have stolen our song.

951
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,229
Hey, you mean to
say we're cheaters?

952
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:46,995
Yeah exactly,
you guys are cheaters.

953
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:49,061
What the"

954
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:12,584
Debu!

955
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:20,130
Debu who did this?

956
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:22,332
Debu...

957
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,592
You son of b***h!

958
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:07,177
They insulted mother.

959
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,881
They don't know how mother...

960
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:15,115
...saved every penny to
send me here to study.

961
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:20,054
Will something happen to me?

962
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:22,820
You will be fine.

963
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:25,859
Mother has no one
else except for me.

964
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:30,265
Take me to my mother.

965
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,867
She's been waiting
for me for two years.

966
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:45,814
"Whenever I was hurt."

967
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:51,252
"Your eyes would brim with tears."

968
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:56,815
"A simple puff...wou
d
cure all my pain."

969
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:07,975
"Even today when I am hurt."

970
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:13,977
"I miss you...l miss you."

971
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:19,483
"Even today...when I cry."

972
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:25,986
"I miss you...l miss you."

973
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,025
"Mom."

974
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:30,826
"My mom."

975
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,964
"My mom."

976
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:51,811
"You were the answer..."

977
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:55,789
"...to all my questions."

978
00:56:57,447 --> 00:57:02,897
"I would often eat your cooking..."

979
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,999
"...more than I was supposed to."

980
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:13,024
"I am a part of you,
I am your saga continued."

981
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:24,183
"Even today...when my feet burn."

982
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:30,415
"I miss you...l miss you."

983
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:36,055
"Even today...when I cry."

984
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:42,035
"I miss you...l miss you."

985
00:57:42,325 --> 00:57:43,531
"Mom."

986
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:47,270
"My mom."

987
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:52,476
"I miss you."

988
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:10,122
"I would hold on to your veil..."

989
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,332
"...and sleep without a care."

990
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:21,632
"My heart's empty
without you, mom."

991
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:25,607
"No one could explain to me."

992
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:32,343
"When you're not with me,
the world's lonely."

993
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:37,050
"That's how much you love me."

994
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:42,996
"Even todaymwhen..."

995
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:49,232
"I miss you...l miss you."

996
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:54,503
"Even today...when I cry."

997
00:58:54,898 --> 00:59:00,246
"I miss you...l miss you."

998
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:02,411
"My mom."

999
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:05,646
"My mom."

1000
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:08,588
"My mom."

1001
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:13,593
"My mom."

1002
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,561
"My mom."

1003
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:22,464
"My mom."

1004
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,945
Wow! Excellent.

1005
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:37,542
Hindi song?

1006
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,178
ls it rock?

1007
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,065
And the winning team is...

1008
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:02,699
Australia.

1009
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:12,785
Yes.

1010
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,783
Debu, keep lying down.
- Let me get up.

1011
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:20,827
Debu.

1012
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:22,185
What is this?

1013
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:25,960
Look, it's not like
I didn't hit them back.

1014
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,065
I hit them too.

1015
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,138
But...the problem was I slipped.

1016
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,300
I was wearing high heel shoes.

1017
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:37,409
Because I am a little short.

1018
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:43,080
One shouldn't have a short height.

1019
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,384
Debu...

1020
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,915
Don't get sentimental and bore me.

1021
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,924
Mr. Debu,
it's time for your medicine.

1022
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,357
Oh, God!

1023
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:54,485
The girl's so sweet.

1024
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:58,122
'Debu was pretending to
be happy in front of us.'

1025
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:00,164
'But according to the doctors...'

1026
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:01,827
'...he was quite
critical internally.'

1027
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:03,871
'And the Australian
police believed...'

1028
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:05,303
'...that this wasn't
a racial attack.'

1029
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,201
'But they will investigate.'

1030
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:08,772
‘Investigate?

1031
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,079
Yes.

1032
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,343
We won!

1033
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,954
Thank God you're here, bro.

1034
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:38,060
First you go and check why they
aren't letting me go.

1035
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:41,465
Mom's waiting.

1036
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:45,567
And that doctor.

1037
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:47,538
He's jealous of me.

1038
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:51,708
That nurse is in love with me.

1039
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,448
If you want...
we'll take her along as well.

1040
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:02,683
Are you sure.

1041
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:04,652
Will we go back?

1042
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:12,489
You know...yesterday
I called mom and told her...

1043
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:15,760
<i>...l</i> am coming back, with Lakshyaya.

1044
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:20,730
She was happy.

1045
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:24,211
She loves me a lot.

1046
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:29,581
Don't worry.

1047
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,817
I will take you along.

1048
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,455
I don't want to stay here.

1049
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:40,719
How did I harm them?

1050
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:44,757
This...

1051
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,565
Who does this?

1052
01:03:56,999 --> 01:04:00,242
Would we have beaten them
if they were in our country?

1053
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:10,114
Take me to my mother. - Yes.

1054
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:14,523
Once I place my head on her lap...

1055
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:19,093
I'll be fine.

1056
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:22,496
I'll be absolutely fine.

1057
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:28,031
Take me back to mother...

1058
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:33,205
Debu.

1059
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:35,140
Debu.

1060
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:36,572
Debu!

1061
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:58,365
'Mom, when I grow up
I'll earn lots of money.'

1062
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:02,198
'And you won't have
to work in school anymore.'

1063
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,776
'Debu passed away.'

1064
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:49,121
'Slowly my dreams
were fading away.'

1065
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,052
'Next day
was the bike race.'

1066
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:54,657
'Pandey sir decided that...'

1067
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:57,664
<i>'...no</i> one should be informed
about Debu's death...'

1068
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,131
'...until the bike race began.'

1069
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,229
'Othenwise everyone
would've been disturbed.'

1070
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:06,730
'Especially, Neilmwho was
supposed to drive the bike.'

1071
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,236
'And Saloni,
who had to remember...'

1072
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,936
'...the bike route map.'

1073
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:17,048
'But before the race began,
someone told Saloni...

1074
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:18,813
...that Debu's no more.'

1075
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:36,797
Ready? - Okay-

1076
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:08,828
Come on fast.

1077
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:24,349
Come on hurry up.

1078
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:53,836
Okay tell me,
which direction now?

1079
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:57,805
Tell me Saloni, come on.

1080
01:08:58,801 --> 01:08:59,745
Saloni.

1081
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:03,206
Do we turn or go straight?

1082
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:05,751
Tell me quickly.

1083
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:06,809
Saloni, are you listening?

1084
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:10,215
Saloni.

1085
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:14,594
Come on.

1086
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:16,094
Come on.

1087
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:17,820
Saloni.

1088
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:25,866
Oh no...

1089
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:31,901
We won!

1090
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:48,524
"We may lose kins,
or strangers."

1091
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:50,996
"But never a friend."

1092
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:59,299
"Dreams may shatter,
so can promises."

1093
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:02,099
"But not the heart."

1094
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,343
"We may lose kins,
or strangers."

1095
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:12,883
"But never a friend."

1096
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:15,887
"Dreams may shatter,
so can promises."

1097
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,221
"But not the heart."

1098
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:21,252
"Even God can forsake me."

1099
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:22,921
"But I can never
lose your company."

1100
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:25,693
"Oh, Lord}.

1101
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:28,257
"I pray to thee."

1102
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:33,797
"Mend the...broken
friendships."

1103
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:36,934
"Oh, Lord}.

1104
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:39,275
"I pray to thee."

1105
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:44,648
"Mend the...broken
friendships."

1106
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:48,083
Hey Lakshya!

1107
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,727
Come on.

1108
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,828
I think you're in love, Jeanette .

1109
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:16,312
"With the soaring kites,
the colour of festival."

1110
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:20,409
"We'll sway
with them again."

1111
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:27,393
"With the soaring kites,
the colour of festival."

1112
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:31,989
"We'll sway
with them again."

1113
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:38,268
"Come back to me,
take me in your arms."

1114
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:42,365
"My heart's been shattered."

1115
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:46,405
"We may lose kins,
or strangers."

1116
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:49,074
"But never a friend."

1117
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,982
"Dreams may shatter,
so can promises."

1118
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:54,681
"But not the heart."

1119
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:57,349
"Even God can forsake me."

1120
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:59,415
"But I can never
lose your company."

1121
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,993
"Even God can forsake me."

1122
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:04,690
"But I can never
lose your company."

1123
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:07,165
"Oh, Lord}.

1124
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:09,828
"I pray to thee."

1125
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:14,940
"Mend the...broken
friendships."

1126
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:18,308
"Oh, Lord}.

1127
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:21,109
"I pray to thee."

1128
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:26,310
"Mend the...broken
friendships."

1129
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:41,400
Where's Debu?

1130
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:49,006
Didn't Debu come along?

1131
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:54,977
"A decade of waiting,
not a moment of peace."

1132
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:59,179
"Makes you
dance to its tunes."

1133
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:03,152
"We may lose kins,
or strangers."

1134
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,920
"But never a friend."

1135
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:08,894
"Dreams may shatter,
so can promises."

1136
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:11,261
"But not the heart."

1137
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,164
"Even God can forsake me."

1138
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,861
"But I can never
lose your company."

1139
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:18,495
"Oh, Lord}.

1140
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:21,264
"I pray to thee."

1141
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:26,075
"Mend the...broken
friendships."

1142
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:29,882
"Oh, Lord}.

1143
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:32,248
"I pray to thee."

1144
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:52,903
Losers.
- You made the college lose.

1145
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:53,769
Shame on you.

1146
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:56,833
Don't ever show your
face in the college again.

1147
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,511
You people can never succeed in life.

1148
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:18,094
I was your age, when I
first stepped in this college.

1149
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:21,058
So many years.

1150
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:23,860
This college is my life.

1151
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:28,773
Unfortunately,
you lost in Australia.

1152
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:32,778
The Australians will
be coming here soon.

1153
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:34,847
The finals are still left.

1154
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:37,478
Our country's honour
was tarnished out there.

1155
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,077
But that shouldn't happen here.

1156
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:42,389
Get it? - I know, sir.

1157
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:44,414
But this college also belongs...

1158
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,457
...to those who
were hooting at us.

1159
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:52,122
They never did anything
for this college, or this country.

1160
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:55,428
Their father wasn't
Brigadier Amar Singh.

1161
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:06,277
'Who does this?'

1162
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:11,184
'Would we have beaten them
if they were in our country?'

1163
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:16,946
The night when your
father was shot...

1164
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:19,726
...he had a choice.

1165
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:26,029
He cou
d've left his post and
made it to the base-camp hospital.

1166
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:30,063
But he didn't do that.

1167
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:36,069
He kept fighting to protect the
honour of the ﬂag intact.

1168
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:44,344
He lost his life...but
he didn't leave the flag.

1169
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,045
When the body came home...

1170
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:53,525
...there were 26 bullets
wounds on his body.

1171
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,164
Decide, son.

1172
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:05,931
Either this side or that.

1173
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:10,299
Time will decide
right or wrong.

1174
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:15,072
Okay, guys.
What will you all have?

1175
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:16,810
Cappuccino. - Okay. - Brownie.

1176
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:18,140
Black coffee.

1177
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:19,251
Tulsi-Ginger tea.

1178
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:21,579
Okay, I'll get it.

1179
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,446
Hi.- Hi.

1180
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:24,820
One cappuccino. - Yes.

1181
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:25,823
One brownie. - Yes.

1182
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:27,588
And one Tulsi-Ginger tea.

1183
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,161
You will get your
order in five minutes.

1184
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:31,297
Okay, thank you. - Okay.

1185
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,102
Guys, I'll be right back.

1186
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:45,334
Hey, mate. Thanks.

1187
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,005
Your study admission
in the college and...

1188
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,378
...your citizenship
has been confirmed.

1189
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:54,948
You will have to help
us with the finals as well.

1190
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:55,986
Okay, bro?

1191
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:57,954
Thanks.

1192
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:14,529
What are you doing? - Sorry.

1193
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:15,241
Please. Sorry.

1194
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,208
The fact is you can't do it.

1195
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,209
The Australian team
is coming to India.

1196
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,779
We've to dance for
the opening ceremony.

1197
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:24,112
ls this how
you're going to dance?

1198
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:27,383
You'll get us humiliated,
just like you did last time.

1199
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:29,254
Bl**y hillbilly!

1200
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,424
Saloni.

1201
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:53,943
Hey, Saloni.

1202
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:56,048
Look what I got for you?

1203
01:17:56,304 --> 01:17:57,305
Cranberry juice.

1204
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:00,486
Drink this down,
and then see how you dance.

1205
01:18:04,546 --> 01:18:07,083
Remember, you said...

1206
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:08,125
...there should
be something more...

1207
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:11,824
...than girls and boys topic,
to be friends? - Yes.

1208
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:13,858
<i>So let's discuss dance.</i>

1209
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:19,962
Silly. No one discusses dance,
we practice it.

1210
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:33,145
Why don't you wear a sari,
topped with a overcoat...

1211
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:35,016
...and a blanket
and then try dancing?

1212
01:18:35,343 --> 01:18:37,016
Stupid, that's not how you dance.

1213
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:39,258
Yeah, right.

1214
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:41,452
Ready, ready, ready. - Bad joke.

1215
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:47,525
1...2...3 and4

1216
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:40,119
Lakshya...

1217
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:48,517
We were practicing, mom.

1218
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:50,953
Food is getting cold.

1219
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:53,098
Come on.
You can practice later.

1220
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:01,032
By the way,
you dance really well.

1221
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,840
When did you see?
- I snuck a peak.

1222
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:06,568
Mom, that's wrong.

1223
01:20:07,102 --> 01:20:12,245
No, I thought you <i>two...</i>
- Mom. It's not like that.

1224
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:14,544
We're just friends. - I see.

1225
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:18,691
By the way, I like this girl.
- Thank you, aunt.

1226
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:19,891
Aunt?

1227
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:21,250
Don't call me aunt?

1228
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:24,895
Call me mom, mother, mummy.

1229
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:26,031
Mom.

1230
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:30,030
By the way,
I consider her my daughter.

1231
01:20:30,759 --> 01:20:31,567
Here you go.

1232
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:55,720
I don't have change.

1233
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:07,702
Mister. - Yes.

1234
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:08,968
Two tickets for tomorrow
evening's <i>show,</i> balcony.

1235
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:09,906
Okay-

1236
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:13,110
Thank you.

1237
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:17,814
What?

1238
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,083
Oh, movie tickets.
- At this late hour.

1239
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:23,723
It's for tomorrow's <i>show,</i> silly.

1240
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:28,722
Two tickets
for the evening show.

1241
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:32,657
Your change. - Thank you, sir.

1242
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:36,064
I was thinking who
should I see it with?

1243
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,696
I cannot come. - I never asked.

1244
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:41,938
Lakshya. Hello.

1245
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:44,107
I meant,
this would've been my answer...

1246
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:45,609
...if you had asked.

1247
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:50,342
By the way,
why would that be your answer?

1248
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:52,908
Because the 'Lota'
only got a handle.

1249
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:54,782
But he's still a 'Lota'.

1250
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:55,886
I see.

1251
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:54,870
"The effect of your
company was beyond words."

1252
01:22:54,936 --> 01:23:00,909
"l lost all consciousness."

1253
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:09,788
"I was speechless."

1254
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:15,529
"And I couldn't
express them."

1255
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:21,266
"The heart
beats just for you."

1256
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:25,034
"My eyes...send a message."

1257
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:27,135
"It's the effect of your..."

1258
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:28,272
So you will come today,
won't you?

1259
01:23:29,704 --> 01:23:30,739
Not at all.

1260
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:37,187
Wow. Beautiful.

1261
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:38,883
You're looking so good.

1262
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:44,492
Hey!

1263
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:46,031
How about we go around
town today evening?

1264
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,899
No. I am busy.

1265
01:23:49,824 --> 01:23:53,966
Are you having an hormonal
dysfunction with Saloni?

1266
01:23:55,096 --> 01:23:56,302
No. It's not like that.

1267
01:23:56,898 --> 01:23:59,936
No, because these days
she's always staring at you.

1268
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:02,308
Either she's planning
to beat you up.

1269
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:04,039
Or she's started to like you.

1270
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:07,615
Who likes whom?

1271
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,822
Stop it. - You see, Jia.

1272
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:12,719
He was saying that
he's starting to like you.

1273
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:13,191
Yes.

1274
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:14,690
No, no, no.

1275
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:16,285
What's good about this scrawny?

1276
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:17,858
He's got no life or stamina.

1277
01:24:17,919 --> 01:24:18,897
What the hell do you mean?

1278
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:20,027
Shut up. - Stop it.

1279
01:24:20,088 --> 01:24:20,793
Shut up. - Stop.

1280
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:21,799
Shut up.

1281
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:08,473
"By borrowing a few
words from the poets."

1282
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:13,849
"I want to say this
to you from my heart."

1283
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:17,050
"There was a slight
intoxication..."

1284
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,114
"...and now it's all over."

1285
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:23,294
"My heart's not in control."

1286
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:26,088
"Love me a bit more."

1287
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,163
"Love me a bit more."

1288
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:36,002
"Love me a bit more."

1289
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:42,172
"A bit}.

1290
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:14,046
"With the sweet fragrance
of your words lilting."

1291
01:26:14,702 --> 01:26:19,702
"With a smile on my face,
I see my dreams at nights."

1292
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:30,394
"It's a new style."

1293
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:35,901
"I learnt it...since I found you."

1294
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:39,971
"I never focused on myself before."

1295
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:42,434
"Love me a bit more."

1296
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,873
"Love me a bit more."

1297
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:53,215
"Love me a bit more."

1298
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:58,488
"Love me a bit more."

1299
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,382
"Whether you're here or not."

1300
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:30,679
"But it feels like
it's only you..."

1301
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:34,417
"...every moment."

1302
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:37,161
"Every time we meet..."

1303
01:27:37,218 --> 01:27:44,432
<i>"...l</i> have an excuse each
time to see you more."

1304
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:50,936
"My efforts to see you,
desires of love."

1305
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:54,412
"Every time I see you."

1306
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:57,006
"My breath makes a noise."

1307
01:27:57,138 --> 01:27:59,448
"Love me a bit more."

1308
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:05,017
"Love me a bit more."

1309
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:10,194
"Love me a bit more."

1310
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:15,431
"Love me a bit more."

1311
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,638
I love you, Lakshya.

1312
01:28:56,364 --> 01:28:57,843
Do you know what I feel like?

1313
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:00,836
I want to tell everyone...

1314
01:29:01,202 --> 01:29:03,273
...that, yes we love each other.

1315
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:06,148
Tell me, Lakshya.
Do we tell everyone?

1316
01:29:06,941 --> 01:29:08,352
Tell me. - No.

1317
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:10,184
Don't tell anyone anything yet?

1318
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:12,914
Otherwise there will be a problem?
- What problem?

1319
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:29,833
I missed you...

1320
01:29:39,807 --> 01:29:41,252
‘Lota-giri‘ struck again.

1321
01:29:42,076 --> 01:29:43,919
'Adam and Eve's
relation was perfect.'

1322
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:46,053
'Because there was no
third person between them.'

1323
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:49,024
'They would vent their hormonal
dysfunction on each other.'

1324
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:51,686
But here, there was a third person.

1325
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:53,464
And an occasion of 'Ho
i'.

1326
01:29:54,322 --> 01:29:56,393
I don't know why,
but hormonal dysfunctions...

1327
01:29:56,457 --> 01:29:58,232
mare always on
a rise during 'Ho
i'.

1328
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:28,132
I'll be right back.

1329
01:31:19,707 --> 01:31:20,685
Stop.

1330
01:31:26,681 --> 01:31:27,489
Stop!

1331
01:31:29,283 --> 01:31:30,091
Come here.

1332
01:31:32,854 --> 01:31:35,334
"Do me a favour, let's play Ho
i."

1333
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:40,171
"The colours are filled with love."

1334
01:31:42,363 --> 01:31:45,401
"Do me a favour, let's play Ho
i."

1335
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:56,014
"Do me a favour, let's play Ho
i."

1336
01:31:59,213 --> 01:32:02,854
"The colours are filled with love."

1337
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:17,933
Come on.

1338
01:32:19,567 --> 01:32:20,841
Mike. - Yes, bro.

1339
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:22,972
I've done the rest
of your job. - Good.

1340
01:32:23,437 --> 01:32:26,316
But...l hope you
remember your promise?

1341
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:27,119
Yeah.

1342
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:29,982
Don't you worry. - Okay.

1343
01:32:32,813 --> 01:32:34,315
Tomorrow's the welcome
dance performance.

1344
01:32:34,682 --> 01:32:36,320
Take rest. - Wait.

1345
01:32:37,351 --> 01:32:39,831
You look changed. - No.

1346
01:32:41,689 --> 01:32:43,999
Do you want to separate from me?

1347
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:45,063
Are you mad?

1348
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,333
We'll talk tomorrow. - Wait.

1349
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:50,836
You're in a hurry.

1350
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:52,741
Maybe boys are always in a hurry.

1351
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,643
But...l don't know.

1352
01:32:55,336 --> 01:32:56,815
Do you still love me?

1353
01:32:56,871 --> 01:32:59,875
Saloni. - Bye.

1354
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:06,485
The first time I saw you,
I don't know why...

1355
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:09,858
<i>...l</i> felt that you're the one.

1356
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:12,954
I love you, Lakshya.

1357
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:15,500
I love you.

1358
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:35,114
'I love you, Lakshya.'

1359
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:37,846
'Do you still love me?'

1360
01:33:46,487 --> 01:33:49,127
Lakshya, what happened?

1361
01:33:56,697 --> 01:33:57,937
Do you love someone else?

1362
01:33:57,999 --> 01:34:04,177
"Friendship."

1363
01:34:05,873 --> 01:34:11,084
"Friendship."

1364
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:15,389
"Friendship."

1365
01:34:15,449 --> 01:34:21,400
"Friendship."

1366
01:34:22,723 --> 01:34:27,138
"Friendship."

1367
01:34:27,194 --> 01:34:28,229
Why did you do it, Lakshya?

1368
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:29,372
Why?

1369
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,238
I cannot tell you
anything right now.

1370
01:34:31,732 --> 01:34:37,182
All I can say is
that I love you. - Lie.

1371
01:34:41,409 --> 01:34:44,253
I love you!

1372
01:34:44,445 --> 01:34:49,394
"My heart's so naive."

1373
01:34:51,552 --> 01:34:56,558
"it's restless and a fool."

1374
01:34:58,926 --> 01:35:05,866
"It loves you so much."

1375
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:10,980
"But couldn't realize itself."

1376
01:35:12,973 --> 01:35:19,356
"Someone please vouch
for my aching heart."

1377
01:35:19,947 --> 01:35:22,951
"So it may get
completely drenched..."

1378
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:27,327
"...in the downpour of love."

1379
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:34,237
"Someone please vouch
for my aching heart."

1380
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:37,606
"So it may get
completely drenched..."

1381
01:35:38,132 --> 01:35:41,545
"...in the downpour of love."

1382
01:35:41,802 --> 01:35:46,581
"Friendship."

1383
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:55,583
"Friendship."

1384
01:36:11,332 --> 01:36:17,408
"Since I found you,
my life's changed."

1385
01:36:17,471 --> 01:36:24,081
"I've been completely renewed."

1386
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:31,958
"if the world's really convincing."

1387
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:39,162
"I want to hear only you."

1388
01:36:39,293 --> 01:36:43,207
"I make excuses to see you."

1389
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:46,768
"I want to be the
reason of your smile."

1390
01:36:46,934 --> 01:36:53,317
"Spend your entire day with me."

1391
01:36:53,741 --> 01:37:00,488
"Someone please vouch
for my aching heart."

1392
01:37:00,548 --> 01:37:04,052
"So it may get
completely drenched..."

1393
01:37:04,385 --> 01:37:07,923
"...in the downpour of love."

1394
01:37:08,088 --> 01:37:14,437
"Someone please vouch
for my aching heart."

1395
01:37:15,062 --> 01:37:18,771
"So it may get
completely drenched..."

1396
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:22,542
"...in the downpour of love."

1397
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:29,449
"Friendship."

1398
01:37:31,946 --> 01:37:40,024
"Friendship."

1399
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:25,009
Hi, Neil. - Hi.

1400
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:27,807
Did you see the notice board?

1401
01:38:28,269 --> 01:38:30,271
No. Why?

1402
01:38:30,971 --> 01:38:34,180
Read it, and send your entry.

1403
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:37,917
I will be specially
waiting for you.

1404
01:38:38,846 --> 01:38:40,689
Bye - Bye.

1405
01:38:42,983 --> 01:38:45,896
What notice was she talking about?

1406
01:38:47,288 --> 01:38:48,232
This notice.

1407
01:38:48,722 --> 01:38:49,996
It's clearly written here.

1408
01:38:50,858 --> 01:38:52,360
Sa
oni's Swayamvar.

1409
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:54,333
Sa
oni's looking for a boyfriend.

1410
01:38:54,962 --> 01:38:56,839
And kiss him publicly.

1411
01:38:57,164 --> 01:38:57,904
<i>Kiss?</i>

1412
01:38:59,166 --> 01:39:00,668
If you want Sa
oni's kiss...

1413
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:02,907
...then submit your
entries in the...

1414
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:03,846
...box next to the notice board.

1415
01:39:03,904 --> 01:39:04,780
What?

1416
01:39:11,412 --> 01:39:13,790
Where are you going?
- To submit my entry.

1417
01:39:31,031 --> 01:39:32,977
Isn't this childish?

1418
01:39:33,233 --> 01:39:34,371
Please don't have double standards.

1419
01:39:34,668 --> 01:39:36,841
If boys have the right
to select and reject...

1420
01:39:37,137 --> 01:39:38,810
...and they can do
anything they want.

1421
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:40,712
Then why do the girls
have to pretend to be pious...

1422
01:39:40,774 --> 01:39:41,946
...and worship them?

1423
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:43,385
They have their right.

1424
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:46,291
To find a suitable
boy for themselves.

1425
01:39:48,315 --> 01:39:50,818
Who gave her the
permission to kiss?

1426
01:39:50,951 --> 01:39:51,827
I did.

1427
01:39:52,019 --> 01:39:53,726
So boys realize that...

1428
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:55,892
...girls are not
like tissue papers...

1429
01:39:56,423 --> 01:39:58,835
...which you can use and throw.

1430
01:40:00,694 --> 01:40:02,196
But who used you, ma'am?

1431
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:04,233
That's the problem?

1432
01:40:04,365 --> 01:40:06,402
<i>She became useless</i>
before <i>she could be used.</i>

1433
01:40:17,711 --> 01:40:20,453
"It's pounding hard."

1434
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:23,423
"My heart's scared."

1435
01:40:24,718 --> 01:40:28,029
"Sweetheart,
let go of my hand."

1436
01:40:28,155 --> 01:40:30,931
"Don't break the buds."

1437
01:40:31,792 --> 01:40:33,999
"Our hearts have united."

1438
01:40:34,795 --> 01:40:37,799
"So why feel shy from me."

1439
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:41,338
Here are
the three lucky boys...

1440
01:40:41,769 --> 01:40:43,749
...whom Saloni has
selected personally.

1441
01:40:44,238 --> 01:40:45,444
Just like it was decided...

1442
01:40:45,806 --> 01:40:49,049
...Sa
oni will choose
one of them as her boyfriend.

1443
01:40:49,143 --> 01:40:52,056
And guess what,
she will kiss him right here.

1444
01:40:58,752 --> 01:40:59,787
Someone stop her.

1445
01:41:02,756 --> 01:41:04,099
I know what you're thinking.

1446
01:41:04,358 --> 01:41:06,065
You want to patch-up with her,
don't you?

1447
01:41:07,828 --> 01:41:08,772
Sure!

1448
01:41:12,466 --> 01:41:13,911
Get lost!

1449
01:41:26,847 --> 01:41:33,731
"
 wanted to
stay...away from love."

1450
01:41:34,354 --> 01:41:40,930
"From the
pain...that is causes."

1451
01:41:41,261 --> 01:41:48,304
"But...my
heart didn't agree."

1452
01:41:48,735 --> 01:41:54,276
I love you.
- "It brought me back to you."

1453
01:41:54,341 --> 01:41:59,313
"Friendship."

1454
01:42:03,484 --> 01:42:07,933
"Friendship."

1455
01:42:09,556 --> 01:42:16,474
"Someone please vouch
for my aching heart."

1456
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:20,468
"So it may get
completely drenched..."

1457
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:24,408
"...in the downpour of love."

1458
01:42:24,471 --> 01:42:31,081
"
 wanted to
stay...away from love."

1459
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:38,589
"From the
pain...that is causes."

1460
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:46,097
"But...my heart didn't agree."

1461
01:42:46,894 --> 01:42:53,277
"It brought me back to you."

1462
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:56,079
"Where there's just love."

1463
01:42:56,136 --> 01:42:58,013
"Just love."

1464
01:42:58,071 --> 01:42:59,880
"Where there's just love."

1465
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:02,284
"Just love."

1466
01:43:03,477 --> 01:43:05,013
Tell me something, Lakshyaya.

1467
01:43:06,313 --> 01:43:11,160
Did you like it
when Jeanette kissed you?

1468
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:15,292
That was just a charade, Saloni.

1469
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:17,927
I thought someone
from our team...

1470
01:43:18,258 --> 01:43:20,499
...has joined hands
with the Australians.

1471
01:43:22,563 --> 01:43:24,099
That's why I
went close to Jeanette .

1472
01:43:25,165 --> 01:43:28,874
So that she trusts
me and gives me his name.

1473
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:31,112
What?

1474
01:43:32,172 --> 01:43:35,619
Did she say who he is? - Yes.

1475
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:39,414
Remember, we've lost
part one of this competition.

1476
01:43:39,947 --> 01:43:41,051
Pan two.

1477
01:43:42,082 --> 01:43:43,993
The final
of this competition.

1478
01:43:44,851 --> 01:43:46,330
We've to
win it at any cost.

1479
01:43:46,553 --> 01:43:47,861
Tomorrow's the cycle race.

1480
01:43:47,988 --> 01:43:50,093
And the day after,
is the cross-country race.

1481
01:43:50,357 --> 01:43:53,361
Let me tell you the
cross-country route.

1482
01:43:54,228 --> 01:43:57,004
Participants will have
to run through this route...

1483
01:43:57,164 --> 01:44:01,044
...and climb on the tallest
mountain of Sikkim...

1484
01:44:02,102 --> 01:44:04,207
...and reach
Red Peak, where...

1485
01:44:04,271 --> 01:44:07,343
...the Australian and
Indian flags are posted.

1486
01:44:07,507 --> 01:44:09,987
You've to take
your country's ﬂag...

1487
01:44:10,043 --> 01:44:12,387
...climb down the mountain,
enter the college...

1488
01:44:12,446 --> 01:44:13,447
...through the college gate.

1489
01:44:14,014 --> 01:44:17,393
And plant your ﬂag at
the highest point of the college.

1490
01:44:18,151 --> 01:44:20,631
Whoever
plants the ﬂag first...

1491
01:44:21,421 --> 01:44:22,627
...the college will be his.

1492
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:25,570
But many rock-climbers have
lost their lives on this route.

1493
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:27,331
That's right.

1494
01:44:28,662 --> 01:44:29,663
Lakshya. - Sir.

1495
01:44:29,896 --> 01:44:31,603
Have you chosen your team?
- Yes, sir.

1496
01:44:32,466 --> 01:44:33,911
Sir, Neil will take
part in the cycle race.

1497
01:44:35,302 --> 01:44:36,440
And I'll take part
in the final race.

1498
01:44:39,139 --> 01:44:40,948
The next three
days will decide...

1499
01:44:42,175 --> 01:44:43,950
...whether our college stands,
or not.

1500
01:44:45,178 --> 01:44:46,122
Best of luck!

1501
01:45:24,751 --> 01:45:26,992
My dad gave his
life for this country.

1502
01:45:28,422 --> 01:45:30,026
But what did
this country give him?

1503
01:45:31,758 --> 01:45:32,736
Nothing.

1504
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,161
Don't worry.

1505
01:45:34,695 --> 01:45:37,733
We've made arrangements for
you to settle down in Australia.

1506
01:45:38,231 --> 01:45:39,733
Just make us win.

1507
01:45:41,401 --> 01:45:42,641
That's for sure.

1508
01:45:44,871 --> 01:45:46,043
Neil's taking part
in the cycle race.

1509
01:45:46,773 --> 01:45:47,808
And he'll lose.

1510
01:45:48,975 --> 01:45:52,320
Because he thinks
you guys are with him.

1511
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:54,988
He doesn't know...

1512
01:45:55,716 --> 01:45:57,024
...that I've
already made this deal.

1513
01:45:59,019 --> 01:46:01,158
Saloni knows
everything about him.

1514
01:46:01,421 --> 01:46:03,059
She'll publicize this.

1515
01:46:04,458 --> 01:46:06,165
Neil will be
blamed for the loss.

1516
01:46:07,828 --> 01:46:10,809
And I'll be in...Australia.

1517
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:24,818
Neil.

1518
01:46:25,178 --> 01:46:26,088
What happened, Neil?

1519
01:46:29,249 --> 01:46:31,388
You rascal! I will kill you.

1520
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:33,224
I will kill you. - What the...

1521
01:46:33,787 --> 01:46:35,164
You cheated on me.

1522
01:46:37,290 --> 01:46:38,701
You cheater.

1523
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:41,996
You rascal!

1524
01:46:48,702 --> 01:46:49,339
Neil.

1525
01:46:50,137 --> 01:46:51,775
Neil. Neil. What are you doing?

1526
01:46:51,838 --> 01:46:53,749
I will kill you.
- Neil, what are you doing?

1527
01:47:20,267 --> 01:47:21,211
Weren't you ashamed?

1528
01:47:21,735 --> 01:47:22,873
You sold the
college's reputation.

1529
01:47:22,936 --> 01:47:24,074
You didn't even
think about Debu.

1530
01:47:24,471 --> 01:47:26,178
He gave his
life for the college.

1531
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:27,183
Neil, I... - Stop it...

1532
01:47:34,881 --> 01:47:38,522
We would like to call
Neil and Mike for the cycle race.

1533
01:47:40,053 --> 01:47:41,088
I made a mistake too.

1534
01:47:41,488 --> 01:47:44,332
But just watch, I won't
let your plan be successful.

1535
01:47:44,858 --> 01:47:47,168
Just wait and watch,
I will win this race.

1536
01:47:47,527 --> 01:47:48,403
Neil.

1537
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:51,006
Neil.

1538
01:47:55,936 --> 01:47:58,007
Let go. - Oh no.

1539
01:47:58,772 --> 01:48:00,080
Who will participate
in his place?

1540
01:48:17,524 --> 01:48:18,764
Best of luck.

1541
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:21,495
Cheater.

1542
01:51:53,173 --> 01:51:56,518
"With the boiling
blood in our veins."

1543
01:51:56,576 --> 01:52:00,114
"By hook or by crook."

1544
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:03,184
"We'll do
what we've decided."

1545
01:52:03,249 --> 01:52:06,958
"We'll go
home only after we win."

1546
01:52:10,123 --> 01:52:14,162
"So... heave-ho."

1547
01:52:16,629 --> 01:52:20,702
"Take a step and...heave-ho."

1548
01:52:23,269 --> 01:52:26,580
"So... heave-ho."

1549
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:29,950
"Take a step and...heave-ho."

1550
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:33,723
"There is power in our intentions."

1551
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:36,624
"There is strength in the air."

1552
01:52:42,088 --> 01:52:44,568
My son has won.

1553
01:53:04,177 --> 01:53:07,590
My son has won.

1554
01:53:09,015 --> 01:53:10,050
I know that...

1555
01:53:10,116 --> 01:53:12,118
Whether anyone believed
in you or not...

1556
01:53:12,318 --> 01:53:14,662
...but I knew you would win.

1557
01:53:15,822 --> 01:53:16,926
My son...

1558
01:53:17,757 --> 01:53:18,929
My debu...

1559
01:53:19,692 --> 01:53:22,673
You are my deb...

1560
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:24,865
My son...

1561
01:53:39,312 --> 01:53:40,416
Sorry.

1562
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,787
We doubted you.

1563
01:53:43,216 --> 01:53:45,196
If we were with
the Australians...

1564
01:53:45,685 --> 01:53:47,221
...then you would've
never won this race.

1565
01:53:47,287 --> 01:53:49,324
Lakshya... - Leave it. Please.

1566
01:53:51,324 --> 01:53:52,064
I knew that you were...

1567
01:53:52,125 --> 01:53:53,433
...overhearing my
conversation with Jeanette .

1568
01:53:56,296 --> 01:53:58,674
That's why I made
this plan with Jeanette

1569
01:53:58,731 --> 01:54:00,301
...so that you get angry.

1570
01:54:00,633 --> 01:54:01,703
And you win this race,
instead of losing it...

1571
01:54:01,768 --> 01:54:03,679
...like you had originally
planned. - What?

1572
01:54:06,005 --> 01:54:08,747
But I didn't know
that he would get hurt.

1573
01:54:10,977 --> 01:54:12,650
And I will have to
take part in this race.

1574
01:54:14,647 --> 01:54:15,387
I am sorry.

1575
01:54:15,715 --> 01:54:16,955
Let's forget what happened.

1576
01:54:18,985 --> 01:54:20,464
We've to win
the finals as well.

1577
01:54:20,954 --> 01:54:22,331
Mike's going to take
part in the finals.

1578
01:54:23,189 --> 01:54:24,896
And he's injured.

1579
01:54:25,291 --> 01:54:27,100
So we'll win this race easily.

1580
01:54:38,238 --> 01:54:39,376
Do you even know who she is?

1581
01:54:42,976 --> 01:54:44,011
She's Debu's mom.

1582
01:54:48,781 --> 01:54:51,227
Do you know I had
a fight with your son?

1583
01:54:52,952 --> 01:54:53,828
Yes.

1584
01:54:57,857 --> 01:54:59,268
You are someone's son, as well.

1585
01:55:06,432 --> 01:55:07,376
I am really sorry.

1586
01:55:10,336 --> 01:55:11,815
ls there anything
I can do for you?

1587
01:55:13,473 --> 01:55:14,451
Yes.

1588
01:55:15,241 --> 01:55:19,189
Promise me,
if an innocent is being wronged...

1589
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:22,760
...in any part of the world,
regardless of...

1590
01:55:24,017 --> 01:55:28,295
...what caste, race or
nationality he belongs to...

1591
01:55:30,023 --> 01:55:31,127
...you won't stay quiet.

1592
01:56:16,836 --> 01:56:18,509
Scores are equal.
- That's right.

1593
01:56:19,005 --> 01:56:20,211
Last race remaining.

1594
01:56:21,207 --> 01:56:22,982
But we Australians
hate to lose.

1595
01:56:23,476 --> 01:56:25,183
This is Sid. - Hi.

1596
01:56:25,445 --> 01:56:28,051
He will compete the
last race against Lakshya.

1597
01:56:28,448 --> 01:56:30,257
He will race.

1598
01:56:33,086 --> 01:56:36,932
Lakshyaya, wasn't Mike supposed
to compete with you in the finals?

1599
01:56:37,824 --> 01:56:39,963
Yes, where did this Sid come from?

1600
01:56:40,259 --> 01:56:41,533
This is wrong.

1601
01:56:42,195 --> 01:56:43,469
Do you know who Sid is?

1602
01:56:45,898 --> 01:56:47,969
He's the Australian
cross-country race champion.

1603
01:56:48,301 --> 01:56:49,575
He's not a college student.

1604
01:56:50,169 --> 01:56:51,273
He's a professional athlete.

1605
01:56:52,005 --> 01:56:53,507
My God, Lakshyaya.

1606
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:55,442
You're going
to compete with him?

1607
01:57:00,313 --> 01:57:01,519
All the best, buddy.

1608
01:57:05,118 --> 01:57:07,598
I want you to win.

1609
01:57:29,308 --> 01:57:33,154
Those who are strong
don't always win.

1610
01:57:34,113 --> 01:57:37,890
In fact, those whose
victory benefits others, win.

1611
01:57:40,953 --> 01:57:44,230
Hitler lost, and Gandhiji won.

1612
01:57:45,291 --> 01:57:46,326
So don't be scared.

1613
01:57:46,826 --> 01:57:48,362
Fight and win.

1614
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:09,717
Go for it!

1615
02:04:10,843 --> 02:04:11,787
Oh no...

1616
02:04:16,649 --> 02:04:17,855
'How did you get up there?'

1617
02:04:18,150 --> 02:04:21,723
'Aunt. First I climbed
up there, then there and there.'

1618
02:04:21,787 --> 02:04:22,663
'And climbed up.'

1619
02:04:39,238 --> 02:04:40,683
Go for it, Lakshya.

1620
02:04:55,221 --> 02:04:56,598
Where the hell is he?

1621
02:05:19,011 --> 02:05:22,823
Hey Lakshyaya 'Come on.'

1622
02:05:23,849 --> 02:05:25,226
'Come on.'

1623
02:05:25,284 --> 02:05:26,354
<i>'Get up'</i>

1624
02:06:31,784 --> 02:06:35,391
"Say...heave-ho."

1625
02:06:38,357 --> 02:06:42,965
"Take a step
ahead and...heave-ho."

1626
02:06:45,064 --> 02:06:48,307
"Say...heave-ho."

1627
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:51,847
"Take a step
ahead and...heave-ho."

1628
02:06:52,171 --> 02:06:55,209
"There is power in our intentions."

1629
02:06:55,441 --> 02:06:58,422
"We are the feet of the breeze."

1630
02:07:07,019 --> 02:07:13,197
"Freedom has no border."

1631
02:07:13,759 --> 02:07:19,004
"Strength has no border."

1632
02:07:20,332 --> 02:07:26,908
"We can tear
mountains apart."

1633
02:07:26,972 --> 02:07:32,786
"Change the
course of storms."

1634
02:07:34,947 --> 02:07:37,791
"There is power in our intentions."

1635
02:07:38,083 --> 02:07:41,587
"We are the feet of the breeze."

1636
02:07:41,820 --> 02:07:44,027
The biggest
happiness in life...

1637
02:07:44,089 --> 02:07:47,366
...is when your country's
ﬂag is fluttering with pride.

1638
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:55,237
You're grownup now, son.

1639
02:08:34,473 --> 02:08:35,281
Bye sir.

1640
02:08:35,407 --> 02:08:37,182
We'll always
be good friends.

1641
02:08:37,876 --> 02:08:40,015
Jeanette went back to
Australia with this promise.

1642
02:08:41,513 --> 02:08:42,548
Bye.

1643
02:08:43,048 --> 02:08:46,052
Mr. Pandey went back to Australia
with Nikki ma'am. - Bye Radhika.

1644
02:08:47,286 --> 02:08:48,356
Bye.

1645
02:08:48,487 --> 02:08:49,522
And Neil.

1646
02:08:50,155 --> 02:08:52,157
If he hadn't
betrayed his friends...

1647
02:08:52,991 --> 02:08:54,527
...then,
Debu would've been alive.

1648
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:55,904
Sorry, brother.

1649
02:08:55,961 --> 02:08:57,304
I called him my friend once.

1650
02:08:58,363 --> 02:08:59,603
So there're no
apologies in friendship.

1651
02:08:59,832 --> 02:09:01,038
I made a mistake.

1652
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:04,047
Jenny found a new
lollypop for herself.

1653
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:05,981
Jia and Pardy.

1654
02:09:06,038 --> 02:09:08,075
They had to rely on
the compromise-hormone.

1655
02:09:08,140 --> 02:09:09,517
How many parts in the body?

1656
02:09:11,410 --> 02:09:12,855
0.03.

1657
02:09:13,245 --> 02:09:14,246
Will you make it in the future?

1658
02:09:14,313 --> 02:09:15,291
Are you crazy?

1659
02:09:17,182 --> 02:09:18,559
Here's 50 rupees.

1660
02:09:19,017 --> 02:09:20,963
Go get a shave, take a bath...

1661
02:09:21,019 --> 02:09:23,522
...and brush properly. - Why?

1662
02:09:24,189 --> 02:09:25,896
Because I am going
to kiss you, stupid.

1663
02:09:31,964 --> 02:09:33,910
We finally
saved the girls hostel.

1664
02:09:34,333 --> 02:09:36,074
But there
was no need for it.

1665
02:09:36,602 --> 02:09:38,445
Because now
I had a girlfriend.

1666
02:09:40,439 --> 02:09:42,248
Now I'm no longer confused...

1667
02:09:42,508 --> 02:09:44,545
...about why anyone sacrifices
his life for the country.

1668
02:09:45,410 --> 02:09:47,515
Yes,
but I am still confused...

1669
02:09:48,313 --> 02:09:50,418
...whether my hormonal
dysfunction is completely over...

1670
02:09:51,016 --> 02:09:52,290
...or will it attack again?

1671
02:10:16,675 --> 02:10:17,380
Pack up.

1672
02:10:44,336 --> 02:10:45,838
Roll camera. - Rolling.

1673
02:10:46,305 --> 02:10:47,113
Sound.

1674
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:49,346
Action. - Action.

1675
02:11:22,040 --> 02:11:26,045
"With the blood
boiling in our veins."

1676
02:11:28,814 --> 02:11:32,853
"By hook or crook."

1677
02:11:35,387 --> 02:11:38,834
"With the blood
boiling in our veins."

1678
02:11:38,891 --> 02:11:42,270
"By hook or crook."

1679
02:11:42,327 --> 02:11:45,240
"We'll do
what we've decided."

1680
02:11:45,397 --> 02:11:48,844
"We'll go
home only after we win."

1681
02:11:48,901 --> 02:11:52,041
"We'll do
what we've decided."

1682
02:11:52,104 --> 02:11:56,018
"We'll go
home only after we win."

1683
02:11:58,777 --> 02:12:02,054
"Say...heave-ho."

1684
02:12:02,114 --> 02:12:05,527
"Take a step and...heave-ho."

1685
02:12:05,918 --> 02:12:08,797
"There is power in our intentions."

1686
02:12:09,154 --> 02:12:12,260
"We are the feet of the breeze."

1687
02:12:18,030 --> 02:12:24,106
"The distances
don't matter."

1688
02:12:24,870 --> 02:12:30,843
"We keep striding
without a fear."

1689
02:12:31,310 --> 02:12:38,125
"The destinations know."

1690
02:12:38,183 --> 02:12:43,326
"There's a
storm under our feet."

1691
02:13:12,317 --> 02:13:15,594
"We spread happiness."

1692
02:13:19,057 --> 02:13:22,903
"We drink everyone's tears."

1693
02:13:25,530 --> 02:13:29,103
"When the world
considers us without life."

1694
02:13:29,167 --> 02:13:32,205
"We laugh and live on."

1695
02:13:32,437 --> 02:13:35,577
"This is an old habit."

1696
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:39,611
"We're Indians."

1697
02:13:42,414 --> 02:13:45,623
"Say...heave-ho."

1698
02:13:45,684 --> 02:13:49,029
"Take a step and...heave-ho."

1699
02:13:49,087 --> 02:13:52,296
"Spread love and...heave-ho."

1700
02:13:52,357 --> 02:13:56,066
"Sing the national anthem."

1701
02:13:56,128 --> 02:13:59,166
"There is power in our intentions."

1702
02:13:59,364 --> 02:14:03,176
"We are the feet of the breeze."
