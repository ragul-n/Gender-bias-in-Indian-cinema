1
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:33,101
"Leaving my father's house,
I am going to my husband's..."

2
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,014
"You! Reshma, is it you?
You have grown up!"

3
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:38,551
She felt embarrassed!

4
00:00:39,152 --> 00:00:43,282
"Reshama has grown up! Oh yes!"

5
00:00:43,557 --> 00:00:46,424
"Birju! Hey Kalu! See, I am..."

6
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,491
What has happened to this village?

7
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:50,894
He just turned away seeing me!
No body is talking to me!

8
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:53,995
"Hello, sir! How are you?"

9
00:00:55,836 --> 00:00:57,303
"He, too, went away. Strange!"

10
00:00:57,371 --> 00:01:01,831
Uncle! Uncle Raju!
Greetings! How are you?

11
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:07,209
"Listen Uncle, I thought
you had passed away!"

12
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:09,042
It's better if you hadn't!

13
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,213
"Hey, why aren't you talking?"

14
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:15,447
It seems that the entire village
has seen the snake!

15
00:01:16,256 --> 00:01:17,780
What snake? Even the brave
men get frightened...

16
00:01:17,858 --> 00:01:20,383
...after seeing Balwant!

17
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,859
Don't talk! I don't bother!

18
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:23,088
I was just asking!

19
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:24,460
He has returned from the jail.

20
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:26,396
"When he was in jail, the
villagers were at peace."

21
00:01:28,935 --> 00:01:31,369
Hey father of Dharmu!
Have you come really?

22
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:34,466
I dreamt of you early in
the morning! - Really?

23
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:35,872
The dream of the morning turns real.

24
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:37,273
The God answered my prayer!

25
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:40,802
That is ok. My dear wife has
become very beautiful...

26
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:43,406
...by having the food of this palace!

27
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:47,351
Go away! Won't you inquire
about your son?

28
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:50,880
My son? Do I have a son?

29
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:53,152
He must be my son since
you are saying so!

30
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:56,457
What are you taking?
Mend your ways now.

31
00:01:57,364 --> 00:02:00,765
"Dear, let me steal in
some big way first."

32
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:03,064
Then I will mend my ways.

33
00:02:03,336 --> 00:02:06,362
"For the sake of God, forget
your past life."

34
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,840
You earned a bad name
by going to the jail.

35
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:11,173
Get away with it with your
hard work and honesty.

36
00:02:11,845 --> 00:02:13,779
Then see. The villagers
will say that...

37
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:15,781
...the father of Dharmu
has improved.

38
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:17,248
He will improve. He will
improve definitely.

39
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:19,114
"Sir. Sir, greetings!"

40
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:23,180
"Sir, forgive me."

41
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:24,780
I promise you will commit
neither any theft...

42
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:27,224
...nor any violent act.

43
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:29,057
"Very good. Very good, Balwant!"

44
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:33,128
I always believe that
a man is a form of God.

45
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:38,334
"Even if he strays a little,
God shows him the right path."

46
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:42,804
"If you admit your mistake, you
can also lead a life of..."

47
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:46,312
...a truthful and honest man.

48
00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:49,479
"Sir, give me one chance."

49
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:53,178
I want to spend my entire life
at your feet while serving you.

50
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:56,947
Didn't you work for me earlier?
- Yes. - Then start again!

51
00:02:57,023 --> 00:03:00,151
Ok. - Drive my jeep
from tomorrow. - Ok.

52
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:01,319
Go.
- Good bye.

53
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:07,194
You haven't done a right thing
by giving Balwant a job again.

54
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:10,767
Balwant's wife is very loyal
and honest while he is very...

55
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:12,896
"...liar, dishonest and sinful man!"

56
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:16,932
"Nobody gets born liar,
dishonest and sinful!"

57
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,910
The circumstances make him so.

58
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,404
And you must have heard this.

59
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:22,778
If a thief has been handed
over keys of the treasure...

60
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:25,317
...he won't commit theft!

61
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:28,787
He will become trustworthy
only when we trust him...

62
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:31,085
...forgetting his past deeds.

63
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:33,849
The man is strong and young.

64
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:36,526
Such man should be with us.

65
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:38,461
"Father... Father. Father, we will
go in the morning, won't we?"

66
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:40,056
Where does the duo of father
and son want to go?

67
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,158
The father asked me
not to tell mother.

68
00:03:42,235 --> 00:03:43,793
This is the matter of men!

69
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,168
"Yes, you are looking
like a man today!"

70
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,106
"Yes, ok. Father, when will
we leave in the morning?"

71
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:51,143
Ok. We will start early
in the morning.

72
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:15,191
"Come, son. Balwant, wait here."

73
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:18,097
I will go for hunting with my son.

74
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:19,263
There are many deer here.

75
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,465
"Sir, I will also..."

76
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,408
"No, stay here. Too many
men make the hunt alert."

77
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:27,241
"Come on, son. - Ok."

78
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,303
"This is very old temple, father."

79
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:53,862
Why have you brought me here?

80
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,500
I have brought you here to share
a secret with you today.

81
00:04:56,943 --> 00:04:58,001
"Which secret, father?"

82
00:04:58,078 --> 00:04:59,807
I will tell you now.
- See this.

83
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,482
So much gold! But why
is it kept here?

84
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:13,083
I have kept this gold to build a
temple of Bajarang Bali (deity).

85
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:14,820
A grand temple!

86
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:24,365
You are growing up.

87
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:27,836
I thought I should share
this secret with you.

88
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:32,306
My health is not stable.
I have a heart disease.

89
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:33,903
I may not live a long.

90
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,242
"Don't talk like that, father."

91
00:05:37,117 --> 00:05:42,316
Strange! Is sir hunting
or doing something else?

92
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:44,284
No sound of a bullet has come.

93
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:46,516
Son. - Yes? - See this ring.

94
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:48,852
Is this very expensive?

95
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:51,529
Not only expensive but
also very special!

96
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:53,389
What is so special in it?

97
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:56,297
See this. It opens like this.

98
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:09,975
This is a map.

99
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,478
Which map is this?

100
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:13,747
It is a map of the location
the temple and...

101
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,048
...its underground room.

102
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:21,990
"Son, if something happens to me,
keep this ring safely."

103
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:24,763
Because the owner of this
treasure is the one...

104
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:26,162
...who possesses this?

105
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,192
And only he will build the temple.

106
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,828
"Come, son."

107
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,238
"You? - Thakur, give me the ring
which contains map of the treasure."

108
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:39,369
Balwant!

109
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:41,371
Daddy!

110
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:42,873
Balu!

111
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:52,990
"Thakur, give me the ring."

112
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:30,988
Vijay! Vijay!

113
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:35,395
What happened to my son?

114
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:42,068
Vijay! What happened?
Son Vijay! What happened?

115
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:44,474
Vijay son!

116
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:50,507
"Mr. Thakur, what happened?"

117
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:56,146
Subhadra... First keep
this ring safe.

118
00:08:03,797 --> 00:08:06,789
What happened?

119
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:47,896
Who is it? Let go of me!

120
00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:49,032
Nilu!

121
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:52,100
No! No! Help! Nilu!

122
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:53,475
No!

123
00:08:56,316 --> 00:09:00,047
Who is there? Who is there?
Who? Who?

124
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:03,047
My Dharmu!

125
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:06,353
"Show my Dharmu the path
of righteousness, madam!"

126
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,791
My Dharmu! My Dharmu!

127
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,232
My Dharmu... madam...

128
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,860
Hey! Couldn't you see while walking?

129
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:35,032
Oh no! Get some water!
Get some water!

130
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:37,099
"Look, he is hurt. Get water!"

131
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:41,237
"Oh contractor, it is a big loss!
Do something about it!"

132
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:42,372
"If there was a loss,
what can we do?"

133
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:43,940
Do something!

134
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:46,952
"Come on, let us pick him up."

135
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,050
"Hey, who are you?"

136
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:54,887
Why are you standing in our path?

137
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:56,453
My name is Dharmu!

138
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:59,888
I always block the path
of the immoral.

139
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,098
Compensate for the loss
of that poor fellow.

140
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:03,760
Who will compensate for the
loss which we are going...

141
00:12:03,836 --> 00:12:04,894
...to inflict on you?

142
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:08,467
"See, sir. I am a little
weak in maths. What say?"

143
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:10,775
You yourself keep an account
of the forthcoming...

144
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:12,140
...transactions between us.

145
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:14,509
Only one man of mine is
sufficient for you.

146
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:23,474
Eat it. Eat that! Both of us are
the disciples of the same teacher!

147
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,249
Glory to Bajarang Bali!

148
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:32,485
"Contractor, our account
is nil now."

149
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:35,526
Now pay that poor fellow.

150
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:37,262
Call him.
- Why to call him?

151
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,388
Can't you see how
much he is wounded?

152
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:39,522
Go and pay him there.

153
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:42,859
Go!

154
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:46,802
"Dharmu, you are really an
incarnation of morality..."

155
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:49,273
...for the poor people like us!

156
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:55,810
"Uncle, I will not spare even
my father for morality!"

157
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:58,115
Don't question about it!

158
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:03,750
"Look, Bahadursing, if you do what
I have asked you to do..."

159
00:14:03,823 --> 00:14:08,283
...we will become very rich one day!

160
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:15,358
But remember! I want all the
jewellery of Mrs. Thakur!

161
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:17,459
Hail Bajarang Bali

162
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:27,778
Help me! Help me!

163
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:29,109
He wants to assault me sexually!

164
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:30,513
Help! Is somebody there?

165
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,183
"Listen. Help! Help! - Santio,
what happened? Where is he?"

166
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:37,351
Hold me! Hold me!
Don't let go of me!

167
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:40,153
I won't let go! But
who is he? And where?

168
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:41,488
In my arms.

169
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:44,854
"Hey, Santo!"

170
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:47,399
See what I have to
do for meeting you!

171
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:49,431
Were you lying to me?

172
00:14:49,502 --> 00:14:52,232
One has to lie when in love!
- Oh God!

173
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:53,930
I have committed a big sin!

174
00:14:54,006 --> 00:14:56,873
You were touching me
while I was praying! Oh No!

175
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:58,001
"Hey, Dharmu!"

176
00:14:58,077 --> 00:15:02,309
Hail Bajrang Bali give
me sumati (Wisdom).

177
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:04,815
I will change my name
from Santo to Sumati.

178
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:09,344
Listening to Hanuman
Lord Rama embraced him.

179
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:11,447
Then hug me! I am not resisting!

180
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:13,492
"Oh Santo, why are you troubling me?"

181
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,153
This is a sin while praying the God.

182
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:18,390
Don't add to my sins.
Stop chasing me!

183
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:20,762
Stupid! I will breathe easy
only when I put end...

184
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,097
...to your prayers!

185
00:15:27,173 --> 00:15:28,299
Kalu?

186
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:29,932
I don't pray to the God!

187
00:15:31,777 --> 00:15:32,835
Everything is stopped.

188
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:36,774
"The Geeta, the Kuran... I
don't follow anything."

189
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:39,311
"I only follow my heart, dear!"

190
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:41,046
"See Kalu, I have warned
you thousand times."

191
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,178
Don't come in my way!

192
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:45,383
I will kiss you later.
I will hug you first!

193
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,517
Dharmu! Help me!
- You won't mend your ways!

194
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,852
"Save me! Dharmu, he is assaulting
me sexually!"

195
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,192
I won't come!

196
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:53,323
"Dharmu, you are under the
oath of your mother!"

197
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,528
"Save me, Dharmu!"

198
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,804
"Dharmu, he is assaulting
me sexually! - Hey, Santo!"

199
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,206
"Dharmu, save me!"

200
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,240
"Hey, you were telling the truth!"

201
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:14,445
"Listen, you scoundrel.
You won't get anything here!"

202
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:18,150
I have many things to give you!

203
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:11,910
"Dharmu, what if you hadn't come?"

204
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:14,810
I was not coming. But my
mother's oath brought me.

205
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,973
I won't romance like
this now onwards.

206
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:20,249
No! I like romance!

207
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:23,877
But not while going to and
coming from the temple!

208
00:17:23,956 --> 00:17:25,924
Then stop doing rounds
of the temple.

209
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:28,255
I will build the temple
right in the house!

210
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:30,822
A temple and in my house?

211
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:32,488
Yes! In our house!

212
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:34,499
"We will have the same house
after the marriage, won't we?"

213
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:35,829
You are talking of marriage again!

214
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:38,062
Why? - What why?

215
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:41,004
I haven't finished my prayers yet!
And she is talking about marriage.

216
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:24,748
"Hey, come here! Where are you going?"

217
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:30,114
"I fell in love since I saw you."

218
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:34,919
"I fell in love since I saw you."

219
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:39,489
"Listen, friend. This
heart is ready!"

220
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:44,127
"You are a woman and
I am a celibate!"

221
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:49,334
"How will our horoscopes match?"

222
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:52,070
"Don't provoke my mind.
Don't provoke me"

223
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:55,511
"No, no!
- Yes, yes!"

224
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:56,980
"No, no!
- Yes, yes!"

225
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:00,985
"You've said no a hundred of times."

226
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:05,854
"You've said no a hundred of times."

227
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:11,061
"You see, this heart
is ready for you."

228
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:59,439
"With love and with willingness!
I will give!"

229
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:04,245
"My life as well as
my heart is yours!"

230
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:11,185
"You are in my eyes!
You are at my lips."

231
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:15,919
"Hold me in your arms."

232
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:21,531
"I am a disciple of Bajarang Bali!"

233
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,502
"I haven't played games of love!"

234
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:30,474
"You will be victorious,
admit your defeat!"

235
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:35,105
Love me for two moments.

236
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:38,010
"Come, my friend! How can we love?"

237
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,313
"Come, my friend! Finish the task!"

238
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:41,478
"No, no!
- Yes, yes!"

239
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:42,816
"No, no!
- Yes, yes!"

240
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:46,949
"Listening to your refusal,
it is Tuesday."

241
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:51,986
"Listening to your refusal,
it is Tuesday."

242
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:57,100
"Listen, friend! This
heart is ready!"

243
00:21:38,544 --> 00:21:42,810
"I came to know. Start the story!"

244
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:47,818
"I won't let you go today."

245
00:21:50,022 --> 00:21:54,152
"If you don't listen to me today..."

246
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:58,560
"...I will all that you
are an ignorant!"

247
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:04,035
"You provoked me calling
me ignorant!"

248
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:08,335
"I won't care about
the outcomes now!"

249
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:13,140
"My arrow has hit the target!"

250
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:18,206
"The love has awakened
in your heart!"

251
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:20,513
"Come, dear!
- No, no!"

252
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:23,077
"Come fast!
- No, no!"

253
00:22:23,155 --> 00:22:24,315
"Come
- No!"

254
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,789
"Come
- No!"

255
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:30,124
"I fell in love hearing
your refusals!"

256
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:34,791
"I fell in love hearing
your refusals!"

257
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:39,133
"This heart is ready!"

258
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:43,436
"I am a woman and you
are the celibate!"

259
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:47,536
"How will our horoscopes match?"

260
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:51,811
"Don't awaken the body!
Don't awaken the mind!"

261
00:22:51,884 --> 00:22:53,545
"No! No!"

262
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:55,018
"Yes, yes!
- No, no!"

263
00:22:55,087 --> 00:22:56,349
"Yes, yes!
- No, no!"

264
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:11,995
"Belapur, Bharatpur, Ramgarh."

265
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:13,766
We have our hold on all these.

266
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:16,034
Now we want Chandanpur.

267
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:18,766
Because this bridge of
Chandanpur is the way...

268
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:19,970
...to cross the border.

269
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,770
And our goods will arrive
by the same bridge.

270
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:25,778
"But contractor, it is very
difficult to bring out..."

271
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:28,843
...the goods from Chandanpur.
- Why?

272
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:29,979
It is so because there is
a stupid inspector called...

273
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:31,454
...Kishanlal over there.

274
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:33,852
He is the biggest problem for us.

275
00:23:35,794 --> 00:23:36,852
Bribe him.

276
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:41,263
He is such a scoundrel that he
doesn't even take the bribes.

277
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:46,798
"Parvin, go and give him
so much amount that he..."

278
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:49,272
...would not be able to refuse.

279
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:52,940
Respect the national flag.

280
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:56,040
Be a good citijen.

281
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:58,481
"Not citijen, father. Citizen."

282
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,484
I am saying citijen only.

283
00:24:01,086 --> 00:24:03,884
"Oh father, it is not
citijen but citizen."

284
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:05,355
"Yes, that's it, citijen."

285
00:24:06,158 --> 00:24:07,489
Not jen but citizen.

286
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,218
Say it with me. City...
- City... - Zen. - Jen.

287
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,264
"Oh, father! Why are you
after this English?"

288
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:17,759
"The thing is daughter, I have become
an inspector from..."

289
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:20,031
...an ordinary constable.

290
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:21,834
Inspector Kishanlal.

291
00:24:21,907 --> 00:24:24,239
I have to meet big officers
of the area.

292
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:27,071
And one day I will become
a deputy (commissioner).

293
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:28,443
What will you do becoming
a deputy (commissioner)?

294
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:29,776
You will have to eat
the same food which...

295
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:31,247
...you have been eating since before.

296
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,782
"See, daughter. As long
as there is a job..."

297
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:35,843
...I can eat even mutton.

298
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:38,481
"But after retirement, I will have
to eat this dal roti (Indian dish)."

299
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:41,123
"So I have made permant...
- Not permant, father. Permanent."

300
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:45,527
"Yes, I have made permant
friendship with the dal roti."

301
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:47,292
No need for the friendship!

302
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:50,795
You can have mutton and chicken...

303
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:53,497
...even after your retirement!

304
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,871
Who are you?

305
00:24:56,141 --> 00:24:58,109
How did you enter the
house in this manner?

306
00:24:58,944 --> 00:25:00,741
"If you have some work to do with me,
meet me at the police station."

307
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,740
Where would you have kept
these 20000 rupees...

308
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:04,476
...in the police station?

309
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:07,817
Do you want to bribe me?

310
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:11,816
Inspector Kishanlal don't
do any illegal thing.

311
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,084
Get out from here! Or else...

312
00:25:13,158 --> 00:25:14,216
Father!

313
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:16,993
"Decide quickly, inspector."

314
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:18,120
What do you approve of?

315
00:25:18,197 --> 00:25:19,994
Our friendship or your
daughter's death?

316
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:22,825
Dal or money?

317
00:25:24,837 --> 00:25:26,498
There is hearsay in Punjabi.

318
00:25:27,506 --> 00:25:30,304
Eat dal but with a punch.

319
00:26:00,472 --> 00:26:04,374
The truth is that we are the
servants of Mrs. Thakur.

320
00:26:04,443 --> 00:26:08,880
But we want to serve you
and remove your worries.

321
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:12,906
And your worry is how to
empty the entire village.

322
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:16,352
Inspector Kishanlal is
obstructing your way!

323
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:19,083
He says that he won't allow
any illegal thing.

324
00:26:19,358 --> 00:26:22,486
We have come with a legal solution!

325
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:23,819
What is that?

326
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:25,761
This is Mr. Dhanilal.

327
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:27,765
"The shops, houses, and other real
estate of entire village..."

328
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,960
...is mortgaged with him.

329
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:32,196
Purchase the property
documents from him.

330
00:26:33,105 --> 00:26:34,402
And the village will be empty!

331
00:26:34,473 --> 00:26:38,136
It's ok. But how can
the palace be empty?

332
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,768
"By the grace of God, that
palace has also been..."

333
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:42,075
...mortgaged with me.

334
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:44,980
"During the flood last time,
the villagers needed money."

335
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,143
So Mrs. Thakur had borrowed from me.

336
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:50,981
But there is one thing. Mrs. Thakur
is a woman of principles!

337
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,790
"To save the inherited palace,
she can sell even her..."

338
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:56,851
...clothes and jewellery!

339
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:02,333
Jewellery? I want exactly the same!

340
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:07,930
"Mr. Dhanilal, I had mortgaged
with you. Not with him!"

341
00:27:08,006 --> 00:27:10,338
Who is he to show me
the court papers?

342
00:27:11,143 --> 00:27:12,804
"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Thakur."

343
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:13,936
But I wanted money badly.

344
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:15,741
"If I hadn't taken the money
from him, I would have..."

345
00:27:15,814 --> 00:27:17,076
...gone bankrupt!

346
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:23,821
I had to give him the
papers of your palace.

347
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:26,090
What could I do? I was helpless!

348
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:28,486
"And now I am also helpless,
Mrs. Thakur!"

349
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:32,759
"If I don't get the money within
one week, I will sell..."

350
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:35,197
...this palace in auction!

351
00:27:36,168 --> 00:27:37,760
"Come, Mr. Dhanilal.
- Ok."

352
00:27:38,837 --> 00:27:40,464
"I said, please listen."

353
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:44,769
This means that this palace
will be auctioned!

354
00:27:45,177 --> 00:27:46,439
And its price will be quoted!

355
00:27:46,845 --> 00:27:50,406
But how can this be possible?
But this is true!

356
00:27:51,984 --> 00:27:54,782
"The truth is that if the times
are bad, even the big kings..."

357
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:57,378
...have to auction their palaces!

358
00:27:57,856 --> 00:28:01,724
"No, secretary, this is the
palace of our forefathers!"

359
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,459
The prestige of our family!

360
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:07,330
This palace will not at all
be auctioned in my life time!

361
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,471
"Dharmu, this is jewellery."

362
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:26,978
Go to the city and sell it.

363
00:28:28,153 --> 00:28:29,415
Dinu will also accompany you.

364
00:28:35,293 --> 00:28:36,487
Take this ring too.

365
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:39,162
But keep it separately.

366
00:28:40,032 --> 00:28:41,829
It is the last memory of Mr. Thakur.

367
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:43,759
If the amount is not enough
after selling the jewellery...

368
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:45,962
...sell this too.

369
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:49,900
"But, mother!
- Go."

370
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,438
I am tired! Oh God!

371
00:28:56,348 --> 00:28:57,508
It's very hot.

372
00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:01,717
"Son Dharmu, I will go at
that river to drink water."

373
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:03,721
"No, if we miss the bus
while drinking water..."

374
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:06,121
...there will be a problem.

375
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:08,284
I don't understand anything
at this juncture.

376
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:10,726
"We will go to the city, sell
the jewellery and return..."

377
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:12,320
...the money to mother.

378
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:14,288
Only after that we will have food.

379
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:20,204
But I will die due to the thirst!

380
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,877
This is the medicine
for unconsciousness.

381
00:29:27,813 --> 00:29:29,337
They will be unconscious
after drinking this.

382
00:29:35,353 --> 00:29:38,982
"Brother, is it drinking water?
Give me to drink."

383
00:29:39,057 --> 00:29:41,355
It's not water. It's a lemon juice.

384
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:43,155
25 paisa per glass.

385
00:29:43,228 --> 00:29:45,253
Give two glasses. Come. Sit down.

386
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,763
Why are you spending unnecessarily?

387
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:48,265
"No, brother. We don't
want to drink. Go away."

388
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,062
Don't talk of spending
unnecessarily.

389
00:29:50,135 --> 00:29:51,932
You are our would be son-in-law.

390
00:29:52,003 --> 00:29:53,231
Drink few glasses.

391
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:55,431
"If it is so, I will drink this
whole pot. Give me, brother."

392
00:29:55,507 --> 00:29:56,838
"Ok, then drink."

393
00:29:56,908 --> 00:29:58,500
Come on give it to me.
- Give me one glass.

394
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:12,250
"Brother, how much money?"

395
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:13,856
Pay me what you think reasonable.

396
00:30:15,794 --> 00:30:16,852
Take this.

397
00:30:46,158 --> 00:30:49,252
"Hey, get up."

398
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:36,339
Hey Kalu! Stop!

399
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:54,820
"Very good, Kalu!"

400
00:31:55,827 --> 00:31:57,317
You have won my heart
by doing this work.

401
00:31:58,296 --> 00:31:59,558
Was there any difficulty
while doing this work?

402
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:02,759
"There was a difficulty,
but I got rid of it."

403
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:06,429
I had to kill my would
be father-in-law.

404
00:32:06,938 --> 00:32:08,303
It's better for you now.

405
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,837
Marry Santo whenever you want.

406
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:12,503
What are you talking?

407
00:32:12,844 --> 00:32:15,108
Who stole the jewellery and how?

408
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,772
"I don't know, mother. I don't know."

409
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:20,011
I know every thing. I will tell you.

410
00:32:20,852 --> 00:32:23,184
He and Dinu had stolen
the jewellery.

411
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:25,246
And now they are staging
the drama of theft.

412
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:29,518
These scoundrel servants should
not be trusted much.

413
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:32,386
"Mother, I am telling the
truth. I don't know."

414
00:32:32,464 --> 00:32:34,932
You won't tell the truth.
I am telling the truth.

415
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,298
"If you tell the truth, your hands
and legs will be broken."

416
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:39,929
You will be bashed! Am I right?
- Yes!

417
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:41,063
Hit him!

418
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:42,265
Hit him!

419
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:50,172
"Mother! Don't hit me.
Mother, stop them."

420
00:32:51,883 --> 00:32:53,942
"Mother! I am telling
the truth, mother!"

421
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:57,819
Mother! - Stop it!
Didn't you hear?

422
00:32:57,889 --> 00:32:59,914
I warn you against raising hands!

423
00:33:00,225 --> 00:33:03,752
Now tell inspector Kishanlal
why you are beating him up.

424
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:04,954
He is the thief!

425
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:07,893
"What? - The truth is that you came
at the right time, inspector."

426
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:12,369
He was given the jewellery
by Mrs. Thakur to sell it.

427
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:14,769
He became evil in intentions
on the way. He usurped it.

428
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:15,931
Now he is staging
the drama of theft.

429
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:18,271
"Inspector, I don't have
the jewellery with me."

430
00:33:20,845 --> 00:33:23,177
"Mrs. Thakur, have you given
the jewellery to Dharmu?"

431
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:25,974
And had it been stolen?

432
00:33:26,518 --> 00:33:29,783
But I had not stolen the jewellery.

433
00:33:29,854 --> 00:33:30,912
Keep quiet!

434
00:33:31,923 --> 00:33:33,151
Do you suspect Dharmu?

435
00:33:33,224 --> 00:33:34,987
What suspicion? It is
a matter of certainty!

436
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,857
The jewellery was
handed over to him.

437
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:38,520
Keep quiet!
- Ok.

438
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:41,788
"Mrs. Thakur, I am taking Dharmu
to the police station..."

439
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:43,800
...for the investigation.

440
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:46,803
"If he had stolen the jewellery,
I will punish him so severely..."

441
00:33:46,871 --> 00:33:48,133
...that his youth will
be spoiled in the jail!

442
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:49,434
Come!

443
00:33:49,874 --> 00:33:51,102
"Wait, inspector."

444
00:33:52,977 --> 00:33:55,241
He has served me over
the years like mother.

445
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,816
I will think that I had
paid the price for that.

446
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:01,417
Let him go!

447
00:34:01,486 --> 00:34:02,817
But law...

448
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:05,321
The theft was not committed by him.

449
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:07,353
I also think so.

450
00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:14,158
"Mother, don't think me as a thief."

451
00:34:14,232 --> 00:34:15,460
Don't call me mother!

452
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:20,896
"Because of you, I will loose
my palace. Let it be."

453
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:23,771
I and lost my family today.

454
00:34:24,843 --> 00:34:26,834
And you have lost your mother!

455
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:31,840
Mother!

456
00:34:41,192 --> 00:34:43,524
"Contractor, take the palace."

457
00:34:46,865 --> 00:34:49,390
I am handing over this palace
to you willingly.

458
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:51,228
On one hope.

459
00:34:52,003 --> 00:34:56,804
If the times help me and
if I have 50000 rupees...

460
00:34:56,875 --> 00:35:01,039
"...to pay you, I will come again
to take back the palace."

461
00:35:01,112 --> 00:35:03,410
You don't worry landlady.

462
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:05,379
Your servant is here.

463
00:35:05,817 --> 00:35:07,341
All the accounts are properly
written down.

464
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:09,250
"Have you written it properly?
- Yes, sir. Exactly."

465
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,754
"The day you will bring
50,000 rupees..."

466
00:35:11,823 --> 00:35:14,815
...you can take the control of the
bungalow from the contractor.

467
00:35:14,893 --> 00:35:16,053
I am telling the truth.

468
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:49,788
"Landlady, where will you go now."

469
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:55,059
I have not thought about it.

470
00:35:55,867 --> 00:35:57,801
This was a legal matter
therefore inspector...

471
00:35:57,869 --> 00:35:59,803
...Kishanlal couldn't do anything...

472
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:04,340
You come with me. My house
is almost empty.

473
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:07,469
I have only one daughter and
I will get one sister.

474
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:11,907
"Yes, sister.
- No sister, father. Sister."

475
00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:13,883
You keep quiet. You always
keep on rambling.

476
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,283
"Come, landlady."

477
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:17,945
Come.
- Please come.

478
00:37:05,803 --> 00:37:08,465
"King, king. Oh my king."

479
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,998
"I have won the game of heart."

480
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:15,204
"Neither the pundit nor the
priest can do anything."

481
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,408
"As I am ready and you are ready."

482
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:24,820
"I have the control over the
palace of king's heart."

483
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:31,493
"I have the control over the
palace of king's heart."

484
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:38,501
"In one blow the heart
was vanquished."

485
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:44,839
"I have the control over the
palace of king's heart."

486
00:37:45,176 --> 00:37:48,304
"King, king. Oh my king."

487
00:37:48,513 --> 00:37:51,778
"I have won the game of heart."

488
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:55,046
"Neither the pundit nor the
priest can do anything."

489
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,850
"As I am ready and you are ready."

490
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,768
"When my thin waist
swings this way..."

491
00:38:44,836 --> 00:38:48,033
"...the hearts become restless."

492
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:51,772
"When I dance merrily
chiming the anklets..."

493
00:38:51,843 --> 00:38:54,835
"...I win everyone's hearts."

494
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,717
"When my thin waist
swings this way..."

495
00:39:01,786 --> 00:39:04,721
"...the hearts become restless."

496
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:08,725
"When I dance merrily
chiming the anklets..."

497
00:39:08,793 --> 00:39:11,318
"...I win everyone's hearts."

498
00:39:11,796 --> 00:39:15,732
"When I come with after
beautifying myself..."

499
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,132
"...and dance all the people
tell me to sing, sing, sing."

500
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:21,738
"King, king. Oh my king."

501
00:39:21,806 --> 00:39:24,969
"I have won the game of heart."

502
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:28,337
"Neither the pundit nor the
priest can do anything."

503
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:31,439
"As I am ready and you are ready."

504
00:39:31,516 --> 00:39:37,944
"I have the control over the
palace of king's heart."

505
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:21,788
"I have loved you and..."

506
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:25,029
"...after getting you my
heart is intoxicated."

507
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,803
"I will come close to
you into your arms."

508
00:40:28,873 --> 00:40:31,501
"And give my youth to you."

509
00:40:35,379 --> 00:40:38,815
"I have loved you and..."

510
00:40:38,883 --> 00:40:41,408
"...after getting you my
heart is intoxicated."

511
00:40:42,153 --> 00:40:45,213
"I will come close to
you into your arms."

512
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:48,019
"And give my youth to you."

513
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:51,953
"You are the king of hearts and
I am the queen of hearts."

514
00:40:52,029 --> 00:40:55,089
"I am crazy for you. Come,
come, come."

515
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,460
"King, king. Oh my king."

516
00:40:58,536 --> 00:41:01,767
"I have won the game of heart."

517
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,070
"Neither the pundit nor the
priest can do anything."

518
00:41:05,143 --> 00:41:08,203
"As I am ready and you are ready."

519
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:14,445
"I have the control over the
palace of king's heart."

520
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:21,849
"In one blow the heart
was vanquished."

521
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:27,990
"I have the control over the
palace of king's heart."

522
00:41:50,221 --> 00:41:51,552
You and start the work of
evacuating the village.

523
00:41:53,057 --> 00:41:56,458
And first of all evacuate
the house of your Santo.

524
00:41:56,527 --> 00:41:58,825
"Go and tell you contractor, I
will kill anyone who tried..."

525
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:02,332
...to drive me out of my house.

526
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,265
"What is left in this house,
dear Santo?"

527
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:08,369
Come. I will take you to my house.

528
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,774
Not even my shoes will like
to go in your house.

529
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:12,776
"Go from here, scoundrel.
Or else I will..."

530
00:42:12,844 --> 00:42:14,243
...teach you a lesson
with this same stick.

531
00:42:17,448 --> 00:42:20,042
"I will teach you a lesson,
my sweetheart."

532
00:42:20,785 --> 00:42:21,843
Let go of me.

533
00:42:24,856 --> 00:42:25,914
Fool!
- Let go of me.

534
00:42:33,364 --> 00:42:36,299
"What is it, Kalu? Why are
you banging your head?"

535
00:42:36,868 --> 00:42:38,267
"Dharmu, don't come in the middle."

536
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,997
This house is mortgaged
with the contractor.

537
00:42:41,873 --> 00:42:43,807
The time period is over
and I have come to...

538
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:46,537
...evacuate this house.

539
00:42:46,878 --> 00:42:48,812
Tell me. Our contractor isn't
satisfied after evacuating my...

540
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,440
...mother's bungalow.

541
00:42:52,149 --> 00:42:53,377
Do you want to evacuate
the whole village?

542
00:42:53,484 --> 00:42:55,543
I don't know anything about that.
- Throw all the things outside.

543
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,817
Hey! If anyone touches the
thing in the house then...

544
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:01,825
...he will be killed.

545
00:43:01,893 --> 00:43:03,087
Beat this fool.

546
00:44:07,758 --> 00:44:08,816
Get up.

547
00:44:10,027 --> 00:44:11,153
Don't fight.

548
00:44:11,228 --> 00:44:14,493
Stop it. Come with us.

549
00:44:14,832 --> 00:44:15,890
Let go of me.

550
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:20,301
"I will show this scoundrel.
- Stop it, I said."

551
00:44:20,438 --> 00:44:23,771
On the basis of the testimonies
of the witnesses and...

552
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:27,777
"...the evidences presented,
this court declares..."

553
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:31,781
"...convicts Dharmu, Ram Singh, Kalu,
Krishan and Sukdev..."

554
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:34,340
...guilty and all are
fined 500 rupees.

555
00:44:35,353 --> 00:44:37,787
If they can't pay the fine
then they will be given...

556
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:40,847
...one month imprisonment.

557
00:44:44,395 --> 00:44:47,193
Pay the fine of our men
and get them released.

558
00:44:47,264 --> 00:44:48,356
"Alright, sir."

559
00:45:04,815 --> 00:45:05,907
Keep it open.

560
00:45:08,085 --> 00:45:10,747
"Hey 61-62, give this to the laundry."

561
00:45:10,821 --> 00:45:12,755
And tell him to starch it properly.

562
00:45:12,823 --> 00:45:14,051
I will come back soon.

563
00:45:14,825 --> 00:45:16,952
"Really, it is of no
use to advise you."

564
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:18,759
You have said many times
that you won't come in...

565
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:20,763
"...this prison, but double
that time you have come..."

566
00:45:20,831 --> 00:45:22,822
...in this prison.

567
00:45:24,035 --> 00:45:26,026
Now the government is giving
you a last change this time.

568
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:27,161
To come in the prison.

569
00:45:27,238 --> 00:45:30,105
"No, to go away from here forever."

570
00:45:31,108 --> 00:45:33,770
"It is possible that outside this
city, away from your friends..."

571
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:37,143
...you might learn something
and become a good human.

572
00:45:37,214 --> 00:45:38,841
Therefore the government...

573
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:40,349
I understood. I understood.

574
00:45:41,285 --> 00:45:44,846
In plain words it means that
the government has exiled me.

575
00:45:44,922 --> 00:45:45,980
"Am I right? Alright, sir."

576
00:45:46,057 --> 00:45:47,115
I am going.

577
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:48,783
When my own house is not
my own anymore then...

578
00:45:48,859 --> 00:45:50,019
...in which other part of
the world can I live?

579
00:45:51,062 --> 00:45:57,126
"I am going away from your
world in helplessness."

580
00:45:57,201 --> 00:46:00,068
"Remember me."

581
00:46:00,404 --> 00:46:03,202
"Away from your world."

582
00:46:03,274 --> 00:46:04,468
Let's go.
- Where?

583
00:46:04,809 --> 00:46:05,867
In exile.

584
00:46:05,943 --> 00:46:07,001
Where is it?

585
00:46:07,144 --> 00:46:09,908
You just whip your horse.

586
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,074
I will get down at the place
your horse stops exhausted.

587
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,744
Let me become inspector one time.

588
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,481
Then I will fill your
life with luxury.

589
00:46:18,089 --> 00:46:19,283
Everyone says so.

590
00:46:19,356 --> 00:46:22,018
But when they get the post
their nature change.

591
00:46:22,093 --> 00:46:23,151
"No, brother."

592
00:46:23,227 --> 00:46:26,253
"I am constable BA Talwar,
number 204."

593
00:46:26,931 --> 00:46:28,956
I take care of my subordinates.

594
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:30,963
"Constable, listen."

595
00:46:34,438 --> 00:46:37,032
How long did you have that?
- 4 years.

596
00:46:37,108 --> 00:46:38,166
4 years!

597
00:46:39,276 --> 00:46:40,766
Your cheeks have become
fat by consuming...

598
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:42,938
...government wealth.

599
00:46:43,013 --> 00:46:44,503
Where is inspector Kishanlal?

600
00:46:45,116 --> 00:46:46,242
Sir is inside.

601
00:46:46,851 --> 00:46:48,512
When are you going in?

602
00:46:48,586 --> 00:46:50,520
"But, why should I go in?"

603
00:46:50,588 --> 00:46:52,522
"I mean, inside on the
chair of inspector."

604
00:46:53,858 --> 00:46:55,519
"Yes, actually my 2 strips..."

605
00:46:55,593 --> 00:46:57,117
"204, what is this commotion?"

606
00:46:57,194 --> 00:46:58,252
Sir has come.

607
00:46:58,329 --> 00:47:00,456
"Hello inspector.
- Yes, speak up."

608
00:47:01,132 --> 00:47:03,430
I've come to tell you. I have
come to say many things.

609
00:47:03,501 --> 00:47:06,334
"Sir, I think he is deputy
from the city."

610
00:47:06,804 --> 00:47:07,862
Then why are you
staring at my face?

611
00:47:07,938 --> 00:47:08,996
Go and bring tea.

612
00:47:09,073 --> 00:47:10,472
"No, no. I don't need tea."

613
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:12,975
"There is the need, sir.
Bring special tea."

614
00:47:13,043 --> 00:47:15,341
"Bring it if it is special.
And listen, come here. - Yes."

615
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,381
If we drink tea empty-stomach
we get acidity.

616
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:22,749
"So you do one thing, bring some
biscuits for me. - Alright."

617
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:26,119
"Listen, don't bring biscuits,
but cake. Bring cake."

618
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:28,124
"I will bring the cake.
- Yes, go now. - And sweets too."

619
00:47:28,192 --> 00:47:30,160
"Bring the sweets. Come, sir."

620
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:31,819
Welcome.

621
00:47:31,896 --> 00:47:33,830
"Bring special tea, cake and sweets."

622
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:35,092
"Is there a feast, constable?"

623
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:37,828
There is not feast. But our
deputy has come. Deputy.

624
00:47:37,902 --> 00:47:39,961
Now Kishanlal will be in fired.

625
00:47:40,037 --> 00:47:41,937
And I will become the inspector.

626
00:47:42,006 --> 00:47:44,406
Inspector BA Talwar.

627
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:47,000
Where were you before?
- In prison.

628
00:47:47,444 --> 00:47:49,844
Alright. So you are jailor.

629
00:47:49,914 --> 00:47:50,972
Sit down. Please sit down.

630
00:47:51,048 --> 00:47:52,913
"No, no. That is your chair.
- You sit there."

631
00:47:52,983 --> 00:47:54,109
"Then sit here.
- Alright, I will sit here."

632
00:47:54,185 --> 00:47:55,277
Come.

633
00:47:55,352 --> 00:47:57,115
204! Bring the tea quickly.

634
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:00,913
"Bring it, bring it. Give it to me."

635
00:48:00,991 --> 00:48:02,219
Take this.

636
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:06,126
You are... - First sit down.
Why are you standing?

637
00:48:07,298 --> 00:48:08,788
In which jail you were?

638
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,732
"Sir, the thing about prisons is
that all of them look the same."

639
00:48:11,802 --> 00:48:12,860
There seems to be no difference.

640
00:48:13,137 --> 00:48:15,037
Actually I keep making
trips to prisons.

641
00:48:15,105 --> 00:48:17,733
"Inside, outside and inside, outside."

642
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,241
Do you like the sweets?
- Excellent. Excellent.

643
00:48:23,314 --> 00:48:26,112
"Take cake, deputy?
- Deputy?"

644
00:48:26,183 --> 00:48:27,241
Yes.

645
00:48:28,819 --> 00:48:30,116
"No, no. I am not deputy."

646
00:48:30,187 --> 00:48:32,280
"Aren't you deputy?
- No, no."

647
00:48:32,356 --> 00:48:33,948
It means you are higher...

648
00:48:44,301 --> 00:48:46,098
Chakradhari.
- Chakradhari?

649
00:48:46,904 --> 00:48:49,065
Exiled.
- Exiled?

650
00:48:49,139 --> 00:48:50,504
Keep the tea down.

651
00:48:50,841 --> 00:48:52,035
"The glass too.
- Yes, even the glass."

652
00:48:52,776 --> 00:48:53,834
Keep the cake down.

653
00:48:53,911 --> 00:48:55,105
That biscuit...

654
00:48:57,047 --> 00:48:58,241
Stand up.

655
00:49:00,217 --> 00:49:01,707
"Sir, when my prison term
was over in the city..."

656
00:49:01,785 --> 00:49:04,185
...they said that I was not allowed
to live in the city.

657
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,313
Therefore I came here.

658
00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:06,915
"204.
- Yes, sir."

659
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:08,390
"Write down his name and address.
- Yes, sir."

660
00:49:08,459 --> 00:49:10,051
Can I drink the tea? It
would get cold. - No!

661
00:49:11,462 --> 00:49:13,794
What is your name?
- Chakradhari.

662
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:16,059
Address?
- Chandanpur police station.

663
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,859
"Care of, inspector Kishanlal."

664
00:49:18,936 --> 00:49:21,370
But why under inspector Kishanlal?

665
00:49:21,438 --> 00:49:23,872
"Look, in this village I don't
know anyone besides you."

666
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:25,431
And you are a good man.

667
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:27,106
"Alright, alright.
- Ok, sir."

668
00:49:27,177 --> 00:49:28,735
But if you want to live in this
village you will have...

669
00:49:28,812 --> 00:49:29,870
...to leave your old habits. - Ok.

670
00:49:29,947 --> 00:49:31,005
You will have to come to police
station every morning...

671
00:49:31,081 --> 00:49:32,139
...and evening. - Ok.

672
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:33,945
And you will have to live
like a good citizen.

673
00:49:34,018 --> 00:49:36,748
What kind of citizen?
- A good citizen.

674
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:37,980
"I see, good citizen."

675
00:49:38,055 --> 00:49:39,750
Then does this good citizen
have the right...

676
00:49:39,823 --> 00:49:40,949
...to eat stomach-full food.

677
00:49:41,025 --> 00:49:43,220
Sure.
- For getting food we need money.

678
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:45,023
And for money we need job.
- Where can I get the job?

679
00:49:45,095 --> 00:49:47,359
If you want job then go to the
contractor of the forest.

680
00:49:47,431 --> 00:49:50,059
Take 20 rupees for your hard work.

681
00:49:50,134 --> 00:49:52,295
And I will keep 20 rupees. Move.

682
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:55,338
"Come, Changu. Come, come."

683
00:49:56,307 --> 00:50:02,371
You earned 20 rupees. You
take 15 and I will keep 5.

684
00:50:02,446 --> 00:50:03,777
Is the account clear?

685
00:50:05,015 --> 00:50:07,347
"You don't work, Raghu? What
should I give to you?"

686
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:10,852
Give him food twice a day.
He will become healthy.

687
00:50:12,389 --> 00:50:13,788
"Who are you, sir?"

688
00:50:13,857 --> 00:50:16,348
Is the account clear?
- Yes it is clear. It is clear.

689
00:50:16,427 --> 00:50:18,224
"Accountant, is it clear?
- It is perfect."

690
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:19,455
Go home. Go now.
- Who are you?

691
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:20,929
You keep quiet.

692
00:50:20,998 --> 00:50:22,863
Don't you see the rich
clothes he is wearing?

693
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:24,332
He is from the city. City.

694
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:25,800
"Sit. Sit here, sir."

695
00:50:25,869 --> 00:50:27,928
Sit her. Please sit down.

696
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,266
Take it carefully.

697
00:50:36,547 --> 00:50:42,076
"I think sir, you are an officer
of income tax department."

698
00:50:42,152 --> 00:50:45,519
Therefore I didn't see him
running with the files.

699
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:47,386
"He went to urinate, sir.
Urinate. To urinate."

700
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:50,222
On seeing my departments
many people do that.

701
00:50:50,294 --> 00:50:52,091
It is a different matter
that even I too did it.

702
00:50:52,896 --> 00:50:56,832
"Sir, if you had informed
me before then I would..."

703
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,768
...have told the contractor
and send a jeep for you.

704
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:02,465
No. There is not need for that.

705
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:04,837
Even Kishnu told me that he
liked to send a jeep for me.

706
00:51:04,908 --> 00:51:06,102
But I refused him.

707
00:51:06,176 --> 00:51:08,838
"Who is Kishnu?
- Kishnu, our inspector Kishanlal."

708
00:51:08,912 --> 00:51:10,345
"Oh yes, the inspector of my village."

709
00:51:10,414 --> 00:51:12,109
"He is a very good man.
- Yes, he is a very good man."

710
00:51:12,182 --> 00:51:13,843
He is my relative.

711
00:51:14,385 --> 00:51:16,785
He is my uncle's brother's
nephew's younger uncle's...

712
00:51:16,854 --> 00:51:19,914
...elder uncle's sister's
brother-in-law.

713
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:23,357
He is a distant relative but
he respects me very dearly.

714
00:51:23,427 --> 00:51:25,520
He is a very good man. He is a
very good man. - Massage this.

715
00:51:25,596 --> 00:51:27,257
I will massage it.
I will massage it.

716
00:51:27,331 --> 00:51:29,322
You sit. You sit. I will massage it.

717
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,796
But if the contractor finds out
that you take half the share...

718
00:51:34,872 --> 00:51:38,865
"...from the worker's salary,
then what will he say?"

719
00:51:38,942 --> 00:51:42,207
No. How would he come
to know about this?

720
00:51:42,279 --> 00:51:43,405
You won't tell him. You
are a very good man.

721
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,811
No... No... I am a very good man. But
I don't have control...

722
00:51:44,882 --> 00:51:47,316
...on my tongue.

723
00:51:47,484 --> 00:51:48,815
How can it be controlled?

724
00:51:48,886 --> 00:51:50,376
It can be controlled
only by money...

725
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,351
This is enough for today.

726
00:51:59,396 --> 00:52:00,829
Now do something.
- What?

727
00:52:01,365 --> 00:52:05,028
You do one thing. Put a good cot
on some tent for me. - Ok.

728
00:52:05,102 --> 00:52:07,468
And wake me up when
the food is ready.

729
00:52:07,538 --> 00:52:09,028
"I will make all the
arrangement, sir."

730
00:52:09,106 --> 00:52:10,164
Hurry up. Hurry up.

731
00:52:10,841 --> 00:52:12,138
Don't inform him.
- No.

732
00:52:14,845 --> 00:52:15,903
Do you want to bite?

733
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:23,042
So fool... are you
from this village?

734
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,451
I am manager's son.

735
00:52:25,355 --> 00:52:27,346
You don't look so.
- What? - It may be possible.

736
00:52:27,858 --> 00:52:29,792
I mean you are manager's son.

737
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,020
"Yes, you do look a lot like him."

738
00:52:31,094 --> 00:52:32,152
You mother is very great.

739
00:52:32,229 --> 00:52:35,790
"Anyway, since you
are manager's son..."

740
00:52:35,866 --> 00:52:39,063
...you must know where
to spend illegal money.

741
00:52:41,872 --> 00:52:43,863
There is news for you.
- Later.

742
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:47,139
He is Todu and he is Fodu.

743
00:52:47,945 --> 00:52:49,037
Sit down.

744
00:52:49,112 --> 00:52:51,307
Todu is absconding for
prison since 2 years.

745
00:52:52,149 --> 00:52:54,947
"And there is a reward
of 2,000 rupees on him."

746
00:52:55,018 --> 00:52:56,110
Greetings.

747
00:52:56,887 --> 00:52:59,913
And what is the reward on this
baldy... I mean this man?

748
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,821
"3,000 rupees.
- 3?"

749
00:53:02,826 --> 00:53:05,294
"3,000 and 2,000 makes 5,000."

750
00:53:05,362 --> 00:53:06,420
It is enough.

751
00:53:06,497 --> 00:53:09,830
What is enough? - Enough time has
been spent. - Now deal the cards.

752
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,992
Deal it.

753
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,068
500. Blind.

754
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,838
1. Blind.

755
00:53:34,191 --> 00:53:35,351
Blind.

756
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:40,989
One more.

757
00:53:47,137 --> 00:53:48,229
Pack.
- Pack!

758
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:54,868
Blind.

759
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:14,922
"5,000 rupees."

760
00:54:20,037 --> 00:54:22,028
"Is this worth 5,000?
- It is worth more."

761
00:54:22,105 --> 00:54:23,265
"But I am keeping it for 5,000."

762
00:54:24,274 --> 00:54:28,404
It means that cash is over
now we will deal in kind.

763
00:54:29,112 --> 00:54:32,377
"So this is your merchandise
worth 5,000 rupees. Alright."

764
00:54:33,116 --> 00:54:35,277
"And my merchandise worth 5,000
rupees will come now."

765
00:54:44,061 --> 00:54:45,426
Don't be angry. Don't be angry.

766
00:54:45,495 --> 00:54:46,928
The government gives cash.

767
00:54:46,997 --> 00:54:48,794
When you will hand them to
the police you will get...

768
00:54:48,865 --> 00:54:50,799
"...5,000 rupees."

769
00:54:50,867 --> 00:54:52,858
Now will you show the card or
do you want me to show it?

770
00:54:52,936 --> 00:54:53,994
What will you show?

771
00:54:54,071 --> 00:54:55,163
I will show to you.

772
00:54:55,238 --> 00:54:56,796
"Hey! Wait a minute, master."

773
00:54:56,873 --> 00:54:58,807
"Master, let me collect the money."

774
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,354
Wait a minute.

775
00:55:19,029 --> 00:55:20,223
"Look, brother."

776
00:55:21,264 --> 00:55:22,959
"I hit him for 2,000 rupees."

777
00:55:23,033 --> 00:55:24,091
"I hit him for 3,000 rupees."

778
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:25,361
There is not reward on you.

779
00:55:25,435 --> 00:55:27,027
"If I hit you, your value
will increase."

780
00:55:27,104 --> 00:55:29,197
I don't want to play with you
now. I am crossed with you.

781
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:36,170
I told you I don't want to play.

782
00:55:36,446 --> 00:55:37,936
I don't want to play.

783
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:49,416
204! Sit. Sit down. Sitting.

784
00:55:49,493 --> 00:55:51,927
Sir. - Is drinking tea
part of your duty?

785
00:55:51,995 --> 00:55:53,087
"No, sir."

786
00:55:53,163 --> 00:55:55,927
I had no work since morning and
I felt little craving so...

787
00:55:55,999 --> 00:55:57,057
You had no work.

788
00:55:57,134 --> 00:55:58,192
I told you to keep a watch...

789
00:55:58,268 --> 00:55:59,326
...on Chakradhari.
Keep an eye on him.

790
00:55:59,403 --> 00:56:01,303
What about that work?

791
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:03,202
"No, sir. I didn't see
him since morning."

792
00:56:03,273 --> 00:56:04,365
Stop this nonsense.

793
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:05,738
Don't talk nonsense.

794
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:07,743
If you didn't see him then
you should go and...

795
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:09,802
...and look for him.
- Yes.

796
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,074
No go and find him.
- Yes.

797
00:56:11,848 --> 00:56:13,748
And wait. I don't like
when my sub-ordinates...

798
00:56:13,817 --> 00:56:15,910
...drink tea for free.

799
00:56:15,986 --> 00:56:20,013
Pay them the money.
- For what?

800
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:22,752
For tea. Did you understand?
Understanding.

801
00:56:22,826 --> 00:56:24,316
"Yes, sir.
- Go. - Yes."

802
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:29,196
He is smart. He shouts to
show his officer power.

803
00:56:30,033 --> 00:56:32,126
"God, make me his superior
officer one day."

804
00:56:32,202 --> 00:56:34,898
Then I will teach him a lesson.

805
00:56:41,845 --> 00:56:43,210
"Come, brother. What do you want?"

806
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,111
How are you?
- I am fine.

807
00:56:45,782 --> 00:56:46,908
"It is very hot, brother."

808
00:56:46,983 --> 00:56:48,041
It is really very hot.

809
00:56:48,118 --> 00:56:50,052
I think I should remove my ring.

810
00:56:53,356 --> 00:56:55,221
Kohinoor.
- It was a very good movie.

811
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:57,850
Dilip Kumar and Mina Kumari
did great acting in it.

812
00:56:57,928 --> 00:56:59,418
I am not talking about film.

813
00:56:59,496 --> 00:57:01,464
I am talking about Kohinoor
diamond. - Kohinoor.

814
00:57:01,531 --> 00:57:03,396
"King of diamonds.
- Yes, king of diamonds."

815
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:06,095
It is a valuable diamond
therefore I am afraid.

816
00:57:06,169 --> 00:57:07,329
"This?
- Yes, yes."

817
00:57:07,404 --> 00:57:09,065
Someone might steal
it. Take it away.

818
00:57:09,139 --> 00:57:10,333
It is a village after all.

819
00:57:10,407 --> 00:57:13,035
"Dacoits, looters, murderers
are usually here."

820
00:57:13,343 --> 00:57:15,743
Do one thing. Give it to me.

821
00:57:15,812 --> 00:57:17,177
"No, brother. No."

822
00:57:17,247 --> 00:57:18,475
I will give you money.

823
00:57:18,815 --> 00:57:20,749
Who needs money?
- Take the money...

824
00:57:20,817 --> 00:57:23,081
...and let me keep it for some time.

825
00:57:23,153 --> 00:57:24,950
I will keep it safely in the vault.

826
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:27,421
"What will you give?
- 1,000 rupees."

827
00:57:28,358 --> 00:57:31,452
Give. - I will give you now.
I will give you now.

828
00:57:40,103 --> 00:57:43,766
"Jeweler, you keep the
money ready I will go..."

829
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,831
...and get rid of him.

830
00:57:48,111 --> 00:57:49,772
You keep the money ready.
- Yes.

831
00:57:59,122 --> 00:58:00,350
"Follow."

832
00:58:10,467 --> 00:58:11,866
Give me liquor of cashew-nut.
Cashew-nut.

833
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,035
"Brother. Brother, your this..."

834
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:21,475
"Brother, your cloth..."

835
00:58:22,212 --> 00:58:23,406
Thank you.

836
00:58:33,824 --> 00:58:36,122
Yes.
- Do you want snacks too?

837
00:58:36,193 --> 00:58:38,423
"Yes, bring some cashew-nuts."

838
00:58:38,495 --> 00:58:40,827
But when you will bring
cashew-nuts bring hard...

839
00:58:45,902 --> 00:58:47,028
Where did you come from?

840
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:50,068
I... - I know everyone come from
the same place. I know.

841
00:58:51,107 --> 00:58:52,506
But do you any work with me.

842
00:58:54,845 --> 00:58:56,437
Then why are you chasing
me since morning.

843
00:58:58,248 --> 00:59:01,046
Duty.
- Duty. Sit down.

844
00:59:02,118 --> 00:59:03,915
No.
- Why? - Duty.

845
00:59:04,788 --> 00:59:05,982
Do you want to drink liquor?

846
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:08,715
"Yes, drink it."

847
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,953
No. Duty.

848
00:59:12,062 --> 00:59:13,324
Your duty...

849
00:59:13,797 --> 00:59:16,027
Till what time will
you be on the duty?

850
00:59:16,099 --> 00:59:17,225
Till 4 O'clock.

851
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,460
There are 2 more hours.

852
00:59:27,811 --> 00:59:28,869
How is it now?

853
00:59:28,945 --> 00:59:30,003
How did it happen?

854
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,982
The short hand on 4 and
the long one on 12.

855
00:59:35,418 --> 00:59:37,113
By in this watch the
short hand is on 2.

856
00:59:37,187 --> 00:59:38,814
Forget this small watch
and look at the big one.

857
00:59:39,222 --> 00:59:42,020
Come now.
- Alright. I am free from duty now.

858
00:59:42,092 --> 00:59:43,150
Now sit. Sit.

859
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:46,389
No.
- What happened?

860
00:59:46,463 --> 00:59:48,829
No! I am in uniform.

861
00:59:49,232 --> 00:59:50,927
"So what happened, friend?"

862
00:59:51,001 --> 00:59:52,366
Remove your pant.
- What are you doing?

863
00:59:52,435 --> 00:59:55,836
Why? Did you wear something inside?

864
00:59:55,906 --> 00:59:58,431
No. I am wearing it.

865
00:59:58,508 --> 00:59:59,907
If you are wearing it then
remove the uniform.

866
00:59:59,976 --> 01:00:01,068
"Yes, remove it."

867
01:00:01,845 --> 01:00:02,903
Don't fear.

868
01:00:02,979 --> 01:00:04,037
He has worn undergarments.

869
01:00:10,186 --> 01:00:12,347
"Yes, now you are not
wearing the uniform."

870
01:00:12,422 --> 01:00:13,787
Uniform out and duty is over.

871
01:00:13,857 --> 01:00:14,915
Now sit with me.

872
01:00:14,991 --> 01:00:16,356
Come. Drink the liquor.

873
01:00:17,794 --> 01:00:18,852
Drink it.

874
01:00:21,865 --> 01:00:25,130
"That's the spirit.
- Yes, drink it."

875
01:00:25,201 --> 01:00:27,931
It is very easy to drink it.

876
01:00:28,004 --> 01:00:29,062
You only have to do this.

877
01:00:29,873 --> 01:00:32,933
What if the inspector finds out?

878
01:00:33,009 --> 01:00:34,408
"Tell me, what will he do?"

879
01:00:34,477 --> 01:00:36,809
He is very strict man.
He bothers me a lot.

880
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,939
"He says, sit there. Stand there."

881
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:42,178
Follow him. About turn
and go in front of him.

882
01:00:44,354 --> 01:00:46,549
"Look, don't get disheartened."

883
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:49,117
One day you will also
become an inspector.

884
01:00:50,427 --> 01:00:52,122
How can I become that?
- Why?

885
01:00:52,195 --> 01:00:53,822
As long as that Kishanlal
is on the chair...

886
01:00:53,897 --> 01:00:55,330
...I cannot become inspector.

887
01:00:55,398 --> 01:00:57,958
He will be out of that chair.
He will slip from it.

888
01:00:58,034 --> 01:00:59,092
How?

889
01:00:59,169 --> 01:01:00,397
You do something. Do something.

890
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:02,768
Hold this. Think. Just think
that Kishanlal is...

891
01:01:02,839 --> 01:01:05,239
...standing in front of you.

892
01:01:06,176 --> 01:01:09,509
Inspector Kishanlal is standing
in front of you.

893
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:12,980
Did you see him?
- No. I don't see.

894
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,150
Look. Think.

895
01:01:17,387 --> 01:01:18,513
"Yes, think."

896
01:01:20,857 --> 01:01:23,348
"Now see, Kishanlal
is standing there."

897
01:01:32,302 --> 01:01:35,271
Hey! Shy fellow! What
are you doing?

898
01:01:36,072 --> 01:01:37,300
He will salute you now.

899
01:01:38,141 --> 01:01:39,472
"He will salute me now.
- Yes, he will."

900
01:01:40,877 --> 01:01:43,038
Kishanlal. Salute him.

901
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:48,476
Alright. Alright.

902
01:01:48,818 --> 01:01:49,876
Sit.

903
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:51,546
Now tell him to sit down.

904
01:01:54,157 --> 01:01:56,819
"Sir, please sit... - Hey! Not
like this. Tell him rudely."

905
01:01:56,893 --> 01:01:58,155
"Aye, sit down!"

906
01:01:59,329 --> 01:02:01,024
"Aye, please sit."

907
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:03,895
"Aye, you. Aye, sit."

908
01:02:05,101 --> 01:02:06,830
"Hey, sit."

909
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:10,897
Hey! Hey!

910
01:02:10,974 --> 01:02:12,066
Who long will you be
afraid of him?

911
01:02:12,142 --> 01:02:14,940
Come on. Drink it.

912
01:02:15,011 --> 01:02:18,344
"Look, now Kishanlal is our slave."

913
01:02:18,415 --> 01:02:19,473
He is our pawn.

914
01:02:20,116 --> 01:02:21,310
He will do what you say.

915
01:02:21,851 --> 01:02:23,011
He will dance if you
tell him to dance.

916
01:02:23,086 --> 01:02:24,917
He will sing if you
tell him to sing.

917
01:02:24,988 --> 01:02:26,114
"Will he sing?
- Yes, he will sing."

918
01:02:26,189 --> 01:02:27,451
"Will he sing?
- Yes, he will sing."

919
01:02:28,124 --> 01:02:29,318
Sing.

920
01:02:55,885 --> 01:02:59,218
"Come on. Swing it man. Swing."

921
01:03:09,165 --> 01:03:12,157
"1. 2. 3. This world is beautiful."

922
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:14,499
"This is very colorful."

923
01:03:16,106 --> 01:03:19,906
"This life is only for 4 days."

924
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:21,774
"If you want to live then come
with me sometimes, dear."

925
01:03:21,845 --> 01:03:23,779
"Here and there and
many other places."

926
01:03:23,847 --> 01:03:25,280
"And enjoy the life."

927
01:03:25,348 --> 01:03:27,441
"Say, say, say, say."

928
01:03:27,517 --> 01:03:31,146
"1. 2. 3. This world is beautiful."

929
01:03:31,221 --> 01:03:33,951
"This is very colorful."

930
01:03:34,023 --> 01:03:38,517
"This life is only for 4 days."

931
01:03:38,862 --> 01:03:40,796
"If you want to live then come
with me sometimes, dear."

932
01:03:40,864 --> 01:03:42,798
"Here and there and
many other places."

933
01:03:42,866 --> 01:03:43,958
"And enjoy the life."

934
01:03:44,033 --> 01:03:47,264
"1. 2. 3. This world is beautiful."

935
01:03:47,337 --> 01:03:50,534
"This is very colorful."

936
01:04:29,012 --> 01:04:36,783
"If I had been a drunk then
I would have been fun..."

937
01:04:36,853 --> 01:04:43,918
"...to go to pub along with you."

938
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:54,400
"The liquors would have spilled
after getting cheered."

939
01:04:54,871 --> 01:04:58,807
"It would have been more
intoxicating to drink..."

940
01:04:58,875 --> 01:05:02,072
"...along with the friends."

941
01:05:03,246 --> 01:05:06,738
"If you had been drunk then
you would have come..."

942
01:05:06,816 --> 01:05:09,444
"...to the pub and drank
bottle after bottle."

943
01:05:13,256 --> 01:05:14,746
"If you had been intoxicated
then you would have..."

944
01:05:14,824 --> 01:05:16,883
"...not remember anything."

945
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,485
"You would have forgotten
the sorrows of the world."

946
01:05:19,829 --> 01:05:23,162
"Under the shade of tresses
and in her arms."

947
01:05:23,233 --> 01:05:26,225
"You would have stumbled somewhere
after drinking."

948
01:05:29,439 --> 01:05:32,772
"You would have conjured
many colorful dreams..."

949
01:05:32,842 --> 01:05:36,107
"...of beautiful scenes,
springs and stars."

950
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:41,014
"This life is also
like intoxication."

951
01:05:41,117 --> 01:05:43,779
"My friend, move your hand forward
and take the liquor."

952
01:05:43,853 --> 01:05:46,788
"And drink it so that
you get intoxicated."

953
01:05:46,856 --> 01:05:49,848
"1. 2. 3. This world is beautiful."

954
01:05:49,926 --> 01:05:52,952
"This is very colorful."

955
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,766
"If you had been flirt like
us then you would have..."

956
01:06:34,837 --> 01:06:39,035
"...roamed around brothels with us."

957
01:06:39,976 --> 01:06:43,776
"In the colorful deeds of
this colorful streets..."

958
01:06:43,846 --> 01:06:48,112
"...you would have enjoyed
losing yourself in it."

959
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:53,083
"Love, love, love, love."

960
01:06:53,156 --> 01:06:57,525
"What it is to unite
heart with heart?"

961
01:06:57,593 --> 01:07:01,825
"I have realized it today."

962
01:07:01,898 --> 01:07:06,426
"Mischief, decency,
loves of beauties."

963
01:07:06,502 --> 01:07:10,939
"What it means to get
engrossed in love?"

964
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:15,171
"Don't regain your consciousness
again?"

965
01:07:15,411 --> 01:07:20,144
"This life is full of fun."

966
01:07:20,817 --> 01:07:22,751
"If you want to live then come
with me sometimes, dear."

967
01:07:22,819 --> 01:07:23,945
"Here and there and
many other places."

968
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:25,146
"And enjoy the life."

969
01:07:25,221 --> 01:07:28,748
"1. 2. 3. This world is beautiful."

970
01:07:28,825 --> 01:07:31,453
"This is very colorful."

971
01:07:31,894 --> 01:07:35,887
"This life is only for 4 days."

972
01:07:35,965 --> 01:07:37,762
"If you want to live then come
with me sometimes, dear."

973
01:07:37,834 --> 01:07:39,096
"Here and there and
many other places."

974
01:07:39,168 --> 01:07:41,295
"And enjoy the life."

975
01:07:48,845 --> 01:07:50,073
"Come, dear. Come."

976
01:07:52,115 --> 01:07:53,309
"It is 1,800 rupees."

977
01:07:53,383 --> 01:07:55,214
"This world is colorful."

978
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,178
Kohinoor.

979
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:04,453
Beautiful. Kohinoor.

980
01:08:04,527 --> 01:08:08,054
"Father, father, father."

981
01:08:08,131 --> 01:08:09,189
What? What? What is it?

982
01:08:09,265 --> 01:08:11,460
I want... I want that ring.

983
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:13,166
I want this ring.

984
01:08:13,236 --> 01:08:15,136
This is not for sale.
You can anything else.

985
01:08:15,204 --> 01:08:16,728
"No, I want this only."

986
01:08:16,806 --> 01:08:17,966
Father.

987
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,166
"Wait. Give it to her, jeweler."

988
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:20,967
This one is stolen ring.

989
01:08:21,043 --> 01:08:22,101
No problem.

990
01:08:22,178 --> 01:08:25,079
No problem? If you wear it then
police will arrest you.

991
01:08:25,148 --> 01:08:26,274
No problem.

992
01:08:26,349 --> 01:08:29,750
You will get rigorous imprisonment.
- No problem.

993
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:32,287
You health will be ruined. You will
become thin like a thorn.

994
01:08:32,355 --> 01:08:34,016
No problem.

995
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:35,751
"Jeweler, why are you becoming
your own enemy?"

996
01:08:35,825 --> 01:08:37,053
My girl is very stubborn.

997
01:08:37,126 --> 01:08:38,184
She won't go without the ring.

998
01:08:38,261 --> 01:08:40,752
If you don't give me the ring
then I will tell dacoits...

999
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:43,162
...to loot your shop.

1000
01:08:43,232 --> 01:08:44,824
I will get you killed.

1001
01:08:44,901 --> 01:08:46,061
Save me. Save me.

1002
01:08:46,135 --> 01:08:48,126
"Jeweler, why are you inviting
your own death?"

1003
01:08:48,204 --> 01:08:50,195
Give her the ring. I will give it.

1004
01:08:50,273 --> 01:08:52,104
"But I want its price. 5,000 rupees."

1005
01:08:52,175 --> 01:08:53,767
"You can take it, jeweler. Take it."

1006
01:08:53,843 --> 01:08:55,105
"Give me 5,000 rupees."

1007
01:08:55,178 --> 01:08:57,840
"Wait, I will give you 5,000.
- 5,000 rupees. Quickly."

1008
01:08:57,914 --> 01:08:59,779
Yes quickly.
- Take this.

1009
01:09:12,328 --> 01:09:16,162
Hey! Kishanlal. Stand up.

1010
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:19,801
Stand up and salute me.
- What?

1011
01:09:19,869 --> 01:09:22,861
I told you to stand
up and salute me.

1012
01:09:22,939 --> 01:09:24,406
Salute?
- Yes.

1013
01:09:28,344 --> 01:09:31,973
"What? Did you come to
your senses, now?"

1014
01:09:32,482 --> 01:09:34,814
"Sir. Yes, sir."

1015
01:09:35,218 --> 01:09:38,085
"Sir, that Chakradhari fooled me."

1016
01:09:38,421 --> 01:09:41,948
"Now because of your slap the
intoxication is no more, sir."

1017
01:09:43,092 --> 01:09:44,821
Please forgive me.
Please forgive me.

1018
01:09:44,894 --> 01:09:46,486
Hey! Don't touch me.

1019
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:49,087
Don't touch me with your
intoxicated hands.

1020
01:09:49,165 --> 01:09:50,496
"Touch me not.
- Yes, sir."

1021
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,500
This Chakradhari is conning
the entire village.

1022
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:56,094
If you fall in this trap again
then I will suspend you.

1023
01:09:56,172 --> 01:09:57,901
"Understood.
- It won't happen again, sir."

1024
01:09:57,974 --> 01:10:00,499
"Why are you naked? Go and put on
your uniform. Go. - Yes, sir."

1025
01:10:09,352 --> 01:10:10,785
"Santo, even after seeing
me you are going as if..."

1026
01:10:10,853 --> 01:10:13,185
...you have not seen me.

1027
01:10:13,256 --> 01:10:14,518
Did you even forget
to say greetings?

1028
01:10:16,025 --> 01:10:17,788
"Your talking about greetings,
madam, but I have even..."

1029
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:20,294
...forgotten to look directly
in the eyes of others.

1030
01:10:20,863 --> 01:10:22,262
After all I am a thief's daughter.

1031
01:10:22,331 --> 01:10:24,424
Relationships don't break
because of theft.

1032
01:10:24,867 --> 01:10:26,801
Doesn't Lord Krishna used
to steal butter from his...

1033
01:10:26,869 --> 01:10:28,200
...mother's house.

1034
01:10:28,871 --> 01:10:30,805
No matter how the sons
or daughters are...

1035
01:10:30,873 --> 01:10:31,931
...for their mothers
everyone is equal.

1036
01:10:32,008 --> 01:10:33,066
"Am I right, landlady?"

1037
01:10:33,142 --> 01:10:35,804
"So, should I think that
the landlady forgave my..."

1038
01:10:35,878 --> 01:10:37,869
...father and Dharmu?

1039
01:10:43,152 --> 01:10:46,315
"'God protect my son,
wherever he is."

1040
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:49,216
"Greetings, boss Jaggu."

1041
01:10:52,428 --> 01:10:53,554
"Greetings, boss Jaggu."

1042
01:10:54,897 --> 01:10:55,955
"Greetings, boss Jaggu."

1043
01:10:57,967 --> 01:10:59,093
"Greetings, boss Jaggu."

1044
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:07,773
"Old man, are you lame?
Can't you salute me?"

1045
01:11:09,445 --> 01:11:11,777
My name is Shamu Singh.
The dacoits of Chambal...

1046
01:11:11,847 --> 01:11:14,839
...consider me their master.

1047
01:11:14,917 --> 01:11:17,147
The time of masters has ended.

1048
01:11:23,392 --> 01:11:26,054
"What is it, boss Jaggu? He
is of your father's age."

1049
01:11:26,128 --> 01:11:27,789
In our business one who
has the strength is...

1050
01:11:27,863 --> 01:11:29,455
...considered the father.

1051
01:11:29,532 --> 01:11:31,159
"You are too proud of your
strength, brother."

1052
01:11:31,233 --> 01:11:34,430
It is not just my pride. Do you
want to see demonstration?

1053
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:39,539
Come inside.

1054
01:11:48,884 --> 01:11:50,875
Will you close the door
or should I do it?

1055
01:11:52,421 --> 01:11:55,049
You close it. I will open it.

1056
01:12:53,149 --> 01:12:55,014
I will introduce him
to Makhan Singh.

1057
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:14,234
"Makhan Singh, our work
is going to start."

1058
01:13:15,171 --> 01:13:17,401
Tomorrow evening a truck loaded
with goods is arriving.

1059
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,774
It is very good news.
Tell me where and how...

1060
01:13:19,842 --> 01:13:20,968
...will I tell the goods.

1061
01:13:22,311 --> 01:13:24,836
He is Boliram. The chief
of the tribal.

1062
01:13:25,381 --> 01:13:26,780
"Boliram, tomorrow evening
send one of your men..."

1063
01:13:26,849 --> 01:13:29,511
...in the forest of Madhavpur.

1064
01:13:30,386 --> 01:13:31,785
A truck will come there. The
truck driver will ask...

1065
01:13:31,854 --> 01:13:34,049
...where is the Black Mountain.

1066
01:13:34,457 --> 01:13:37,221
"Your man will reply, the place
where your house is."

1067
01:14:00,983 --> 01:14:03,076
"Hey! Hey! Hey, brother."

1068
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:04,945
Not today. Not today.

1069
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:07,386
"Listen to me.
- No, come later. - Listen to me."

1070
01:14:12,361 --> 01:14:13,419
Where is the Black Mountain?

1071
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:15,956
I don't know.

1072
01:14:16,432 --> 01:14:20,493
Hey!
- Don't call me Hey.

1073
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:24,829
"Call me, Mr. Chakradhari.
Understood."

1074
01:14:25,107 --> 01:14:26,506
Where is the Black Mountain?

1075
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:31,980
I told you I don't know. Please
let me sleep. Goodnight.

1076
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:43,925
Chakradhari. Something
seems to be fishy.

1077
01:14:44,794 --> 01:14:45,852
Let's go and see.

1078
01:14:45,928 --> 01:14:49,921
He is not the one. - We have to
wait. - Brother. Greetings.

1079
01:14:52,067 --> 01:14:53,193
Do you remember anything now?

1080
01:14:53,469 --> 01:14:56,870
"No, brother. Actually
I was in dozing."

1081
01:14:56,939 --> 01:14:59,430
I don't remember anything
as I am still half asleep.

1082
01:14:59,508 --> 01:15:01,237
Please make me wake up completely.

1083
01:15:01,811 --> 01:15:02,869
Put water on his face.

1084
01:15:02,945 --> 01:15:05,436
Fool. Water can't make anyone awake.

1085
01:15:05,514 --> 01:15:07,914
Water is only used for
washing. Washing.

1086
01:15:07,983 --> 01:15:09,280
Give me some proper treatment.

1087
01:15:09,752 --> 01:15:10,810
Beat him.

1088
01:15:13,322 --> 01:15:17,088
You are so big and still you
don't know how to punch.

1089
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:18,319
Get aside.

1090
01:15:19,261 --> 01:15:23,061
"Brother, you are young.
You punch me."

1091
01:15:27,169 --> 01:15:28,500
You will learn soon. Get aside.

1092
01:15:29,238 --> 01:15:30,398
You come.

1093
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:35,470
You can't learn. Get aside.

1094
01:15:37,179 --> 01:15:39,409
"Brother, Black Mountain. Start."

1095
01:15:44,386 --> 01:15:47,787
When the general of
army is like you...

1096
01:15:47,857 --> 01:15:50,985
...then that army can't
fight. Understood.

1097
01:15:58,868 --> 01:16:00,062
You want to beat me.

1098
01:16:00,135 --> 01:16:01,329
You want to raise hands
on your elder. - No.

1099
01:16:03,739 --> 01:16:06,105
Why did I say to you? You
can't learn anything.

1100
01:16:07,476 --> 01:16:12,209
"Broken. Brother, brother.
It's torn. - What?"

1101
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:13,748
The shoe is torn. Look.

1102
01:16:13,816 --> 01:16:14,874
Look.

1103
01:16:16,218 --> 01:16:17,276
Did you feel the pain?

1104
01:16:19,488 --> 01:16:21,080
"Brother, what is it?"

1105
01:16:21,156 --> 01:16:24,250
1. 2. 3. 4.

1106
01:16:24,326 --> 01:16:26,191
1. 2. 3. 4.

1107
01:16:26,262 --> 01:16:27,889
1. 2. 3. 4.

1108
01:16:35,271 --> 01:16:37,398
You fool! Aren't you ashamed?

1109
01:16:37,473 --> 01:16:40,271
You are so big and still you are
fighting with the young ones.

1110
01:16:40,342 --> 01:16:41,468
Shut up!

1111
01:16:46,382 --> 01:16:47,849
This is called kick.

1112
01:16:47,917 --> 01:16:53,787
"Hey, dear! Your jacket
looks very beautiful."

1113
01:16:53,856 --> 01:16:54,914
Just look at it.

1114
01:16:55,457 --> 01:16:57,857
"Look at it, fool. Fool."

1115
01:16:59,795 --> 01:17:00,955
What is it?

1116
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:02,088
You couldn't find with hands
so you have taken out...

1117
01:17:02,164 --> 01:17:03,392
...your belt.

1118
01:17:03,465 --> 01:17:06,195
"Brother, if you take the belt out
your trouser will fall down."

1119
01:17:06,268 --> 01:17:08,065
Now wait. Think a little.

1120
01:17:08,137 --> 01:17:09,468
"Is there any use in fighting,
brother?"

1121
01:17:09,538 --> 01:17:11,369
Has anyone man achieved
anything by fighting?

1122
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,408
Wait. What is it?

1123
01:17:13,475 --> 01:17:14,999
Why are you hitting me?
- Are you beating me?

1124
01:17:15,077 --> 01:17:16,442
Now what will happen if I hold this?

1125
01:17:16,512 --> 01:17:18,946
"You can't free it, brother."

1126
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:20,072
You can't free it from my hands.

1127
01:17:20,149 --> 01:17:22,117
"Look, this is called pull. Look."

1128
01:17:22,184 --> 01:17:24,277
And take this pull from Jaunpur.

1129
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,170
So you were sleeping in the forest?
- Yes.

1130
01:17:47,843 --> 01:17:49,902
And that truck came and
stopped there. - Yes.

1131
01:17:49,979 --> 01:17:52,345
Why? Wasn't there another place
for the truck to halt?

1132
01:17:52,414 --> 01:17:54,314
Why are you me this question?
Ask the truck.

1133
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:56,909
"And then few men came out
of this truck. - Yes, yes."

1134
01:17:57,186 --> 01:17:59,518
"You fought with them.
- Yes, yes."

1135
01:17:59,588 --> 01:18:02,216
But I can't see any
wound on your body.

1136
01:18:02,291 --> 01:18:05,021
I don't get beaten up
but I beat others.

1137
01:18:05,094 --> 01:18:07,722
"Look, this inspector Kishanlal
knows how to get..."

1138
01:18:07,796 --> 01:18:10,264
"...truth out of people.
- Yes, yes."

1139
01:18:10,332 --> 01:18:11,799
"204!
- Yes, sir."

1140
01:18:11,867 --> 01:18:14,028
"Take him and put him behind bars.
- Yes, sir."

1141
01:18:14,103 --> 01:18:16,071
"Sir, you are doing illegal work.
- Lock him up."

1142
01:18:16,138 --> 01:18:18,003
I have served this country.
- Come in.

1143
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:19,131
I thought I will get 10%/% commission.

1144
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:20,266
Come inside.

1145
01:18:20,342 --> 01:18:22,105
Padam Shree. Padambushan.
- You have trapped this Chakradhari.

1146
01:18:22,811 --> 01:18:24,244
Who is this Chakradhari?
- He is new in the village.

1147
01:18:24,313 --> 01:18:25,405
He is exiled.

1148
01:18:25,481 --> 01:18:27,278
Wherever he gets food he eats it.

1149
01:18:27,349 --> 01:18:29,010
Wherever he gets place
he sleeps there.

1150
01:18:30,019 --> 01:18:31,748
Then that plaintiff must have gone...

1151
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:32,878
...directly to the police station.

1152
01:18:33,288 --> 01:18:36,348
I want both Chakradhari
and the truck. Come.

1153
01:19:27,342 --> 01:19:29,367
"Inspector, you have
only few constables."

1154
01:19:29,445 --> 01:19:32,141
Get me out of here. I will
help you. - Shut up.

1155
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:34,744
Law doesn't need the
help of criminals.

1156
01:19:55,838 --> 01:19:56,896
You!

1157
01:19:57,106 --> 01:19:58,767
Maybe the law doesn't
want it but God wants...

1158
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:00,206
...that I should help you.

1159
01:20:34,476 --> 01:20:35,807
The weapons went in hands
of the police in spite...

1160
01:20:35,878 --> 01:20:37,311
...of Makhan's presence.

1161
01:20:38,313 --> 01:20:39,541
Has he become impotent?

1162
01:20:39,615 --> 01:20:41,139
Makhan Singh attacked but...

1163
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:44,014
Shut up! He attacked!

1164
01:20:46,088 --> 01:20:49,819
Go and tell Makhan that
the person who made us...

1165
01:20:49,892 --> 01:20:52,122
...suffer this loss
should be punished.

1166
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:55,962
In our business we don't
even spare our own sons.

1167
01:20:56,031 --> 01:20:57,089
Go!

1168
01:20:59,835 --> 01:21:01,826
"Greetings
- Greetings, uncle"

1169
01:21:01,904 --> 01:21:02,962
"Greetings, uncle
- Greetings, uncle."

1170
01:21:03,038 --> 01:21:04,096
"Greetings, uncle.
- How are you?"

1171
01:21:04,173 --> 01:21:05,299
I am fine.

1172
01:21:05,374 --> 01:21:07,899
"Greetings, uncle.
- Greetings, uncle."

1173
01:21:07,976 --> 01:21:09,102
"Give me your blessing, uncle.
Why didn't you inform..."

1174
01:21:09,178 --> 01:21:10,372
...me of your arrival?

1175
01:21:10,846 --> 01:21:11,938
Because of this Dharmu.

1176
01:21:12,014 --> 01:21:14,778
I came out 2 days ago. But
I was waiting for him...

1177
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:16,841
...to come out.

1178
01:21:16,919 --> 01:21:20,411
Who is he? - He is very
brave and courageous boy.

1179
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:22,985
He has done some favors on me.

1180
01:21:23,058 --> 01:21:25,993
I have to repay him for that.
Give him some money.

1181
01:21:26,061 --> 01:21:27,119
How much money you want?

1182
01:21:27,196 --> 01:21:28,254
"50,000."

1183
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:29,456
But I don't want charity.

1184
01:21:29,531 --> 01:21:31,123
I can do any kind of hard work.

1185
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,929
Alright. Where do you live?

1186
01:21:33,001 --> 01:21:35,435
Chandanpur.
- Chandanpur?

1187
01:21:36,872 --> 01:21:37,998
Uncle.
- Yes.

1188
01:21:39,374 --> 01:21:41,274
We need to kidnap a
man from Chandanpur.

1189
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,338
But the police are very alert there.

1190
01:21:44,413 --> 01:21:46,142
If you say then I will give
this work to this boy.

1191
01:21:46,882 --> 01:21:48,110
"Yes, you give him the work."

1192
01:21:48,183 --> 01:21:49,411
He can do everything.

1193
01:21:52,221 --> 01:21:55,884
"If you do our work then we will
give you 50,000 rupees."

1194
01:21:56,491 --> 01:21:58,425
"Will I get the entire amount
together? - Yes, you will get it all."

1195
01:21:58,493 --> 01:21:59,551
Then I will do it. Tell
me what the work is.

1196
01:22:01,163 --> 01:22:03,893
A man named Chakradhari
lives in your village.

1197
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,965
You have to bring him to us.
- He will come.

1198
01:22:07,035 --> 01:22:09,128
You tell me if you want
his dead or alive.

1199
01:22:11,106 --> 01:22:12,232
Alive!

1200
01:22:43,538 --> 01:22:44,800
I won't show you my face
till I get the money...

1201
01:22:44,873 --> 01:22:47,808
"...for the bungalow, mother."

1202
01:23:10,932 --> 01:23:12,058
Dharmu.

1203
01:23:15,837 --> 01:23:16,997
What happened?

1204
01:23:17,072 --> 01:23:18,334
Something is there.

1205
01:23:19,107 --> 01:23:20,768
Where? There. There is something.

1206
01:23:20,842 --> 01:23:22,275
It is this.

1207
01:23:23,245 --> 01:23:24,439
What was it doing there?

1208
01:23:24,846 --> 01:23:26,780
You were not here so I always
used to keep this with me...

1209
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:29,214
...to save my honour.

1210
01:23:29,851 --> 01:23:32,012
"Tell me, how is my mother?
- She is fine."

1211
01:23:32,854 --> 01:23:35,186
Even in prison I used to think
about mother's bungalow.

1212
01:23:35,857 --> 01:23:36,983
But I will make arrangement
for that too.

1213
01:23:37,059 --> 01:23:38,788
Did a man named Chakradhari
come here?

1214
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:40,384
"Yes, he is very kind man."

1215
01:23:41,863 --> 01:23:44,798
"Yes, the one who will
give me 50,000 rupees..."

1216
01:23:44,866 --> 01:23:48,063
...has to be a kind man.

1217
01:23:48,136 --> 01:23:50,297
In the village there is constable.

1218
01:23:50,372 --> 01:23:52,101
And outside the village
there is inspector.

1219
01:23:52,874 --> 01:23:53,966
Both of them should go to hell.

1220
01:23:54,042 --> 01:23:55,202
I don't care.

1221
01:23:57,145 --> 01:23:58,373
What is it?

1222
01:23:59,214 --> 01:24:01,045
"Who are you, brother?
And what is this?"

1223
01:24:03,251 --> 01:24:04,809
This is the reply to my question.

1224
01:24:04,886 --> 01:24:07,252
Now this is my reply to your reply.

1225
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,885
You came to hunt but
you became the prey.

1226
01:24:23,839 --> 01:24:24,897
Brother.

1227
01:24:27,175 --> 01:24:29,507
Why? What did I do?

1228
01:24:34,316 --> 01:24:35,908
What did I do? Why?

1229
01:24:37,319 --> 01:24:38,911
First he punched me.

1230
01:24:38,987 --> 01:24:40,978
Then he hit me from
here and then there.

1231
01:24:41,857 --> 01:24:43,848
Brother. Brother. Brother.

1232
01:24:43,925 --> 01:24:45,187
First tell me.

1233
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:47,990
What did I do? And where
are you taking me?

1234
01:25:10,085 --> 01:25:11,814
"Explain to me, where
are you taking me?"

1235
01:25:11,887 --> 01:25:12,945
And why are you taking me?

1236
01:25:13,355 --> 01:25:16,483
Come.
- No.

1237
01:25:16,558 --> 01:25:18,219
Look. I have beaten up.

1238
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:19,818
I will beat you again.

1239
01:25:20,095 --> 01:25:21,756
I will beat you till
you get unconscious.

1240
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:23,161
Then I will carry you
on my shoulders.

1241
01:25:24,766 --> 01:25:25,892
What happened?
- Listen.

1242
01:25:26,768 --> 01:25:28,497
You will beat me. I accept this.

1243
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:30,767
You will make me unconscious.
I accept this too.

1244
01:25:31,306 --> 01:25:33,240
After making me unconscious
you will carry me on...

1245
01:25:33,308 --> 01:25:34,366
...your shoulders. I accept this too.

1246
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:37,369
But have you thought how far
you will walk carrying...

1247
01:25:37,446 --> 01:25:38,504
...me on your shoulders.

1248
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:40,980
Why?
- Look at this body.

1249
01:25:42,384 --> 01:25:44,113
I didn't think about it.

1250
01:25:45,454 --> 01:25:46,512
Sit and think about it.
- Yes.

1251
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:54,124
I will beat him. And then
I will bring bullock-cart...

1252
01:25:54,196 --> 01:25:55,254
...from the village.

1253
01:25:55,597 --> 01:25:57,326
Then I will throw him in the cart.

1254
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,268
You fool. Do you think
I am ignorant person?

1255
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:03,462
"If I go to bring the bullock-cart,
you will run away. Come."

1256
01:26:05,807 --> 01:26:07,001
You won't listen to me.
- No.

1257
01:26:07,742 --> 01:26:08,800
You won't listen to me.
- No.

1258
01:26:10,011 --> 01:26:11,069
I am sorry.

1259
01:26:11,146 --> 01:26:12,204
What did you say?

1260
01:26:12,414 --> 01:26:14,143
I am sorry.
- What does it mean?

1261
01:26:15,283 --> 01:26:16,807
Please forgive me.

1262
01:26:40,842 --> 01:26:41,900
I can't be lifted by you.

1263
01:26:41,977 --> 01:26:43,035
No?
- No.

1264
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:28,012
"Look, dear. You are very stubborn."

1265
01:27:28,757 --> 01:27:30,224
You want to take me along.
- Yes.

1266
01:27:30,559 --> 01:27:33,494
I am also very stubborn. I
don't want to go. - Why?

1267
01:27:33,895 --> 01:27:35,226
It is possible that
in our struggle we...

1268
01:27:35,297 --> 01:27:36,423
...both might end up dead.

1269
01:27:38,433 --> 01:27:39,491
You will go.

1270
01:27:49,110 --> 01:27:53,171
Hey! What is happening?

1271
01:27:53,248 --> 01:27:55,773
"I forgot father's house."

1272
01:27:55,984 --> 01:27:58,509
"I forgot father's house as
I like my husband's house."

1273
01:27:58,587 --> 01:27:59,781
Hey! Wait. Wait.

1274
01:28:01,056 --> 01:28:03,388
One is exiled and other
has returned from prison.

1275
01:28:03,725 --> 01:28:06,922
And this commotion in the
inspector Kishanlal's area.

1276
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:08,387
"This is not any commotion, sir."

1277
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:10,789
"We were rehearsing for
the play "Ramlila"."

1278
01:28:10,865 --> 01:28:11,991
Ramlila.
- Yes.

1279
01:28:12,067 --> 01:28:15,935
And this rope. I was
thoughting that...

1280
01:28:17,072 --> 01:28:18,403
It is not thoughting but thinking.

1281
01:28:18,473 --> 01:28:20,941
"Yes, thinking. But how this
rope came around your neck."

1282
01:28:21,076 --> 01:28:22,134
This rope is not mine.
It belongs to him.

1283
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:24,405
Ask him where he was taking me.

1284
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:25,741
Where were you taking him?

1285
01:28:25,814 --> 01:28:26,872
Ask loudly.

1286
01:28:26,948 --> 01:28:28,006
Where were you taking him?

1287
01:28:28,283 --> 01:28:29,341
Ask with a roar.

1288
01:28:29,417 --> 01:28:30,475
Where were you taking him?

1289
01:28:30,752 --> 01:28:32,344
Enough. Stop it now. He won't
be able to tell you.

1290
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:33,751
I will tell you.
- Alright. Tell me.

1291
01:28:33,822 --> 01:28:36,416
"He said, come in my area.
We would do rehearsal..."

1292
01:28:36,491 --> 01:28:37,753
...for Ramlila there.

1293
01:28:37,959 --> 01:28:40,427
Therefore he is giving me a
part of Hanuman in Ramlila.

1294
01:28:40,495 --> 01:28:42,429
Part of Hanuman? Yes it suits you.

1295
01:28:42,564 --> 01:28:44,225
But why did you put this
tail in the front.

1296
01:28:44,432 --> 01:28:45,490
This tail is in front today.

1297
01:28:45,567 --> 01:28:46,761
But it will go behind tomorrow.

1298
01:28:47,369 --> 01:28:49,428
"Look, Dharmu. You are a decent boy."

1299
01:28:49,504 --> 01:28:51,904
I don't want you to make friendship
with this exiled man.

1300
01:28:52,107 --> 01:28:53,904
I don't' want to see
both of you together.

1301
01:28:54,442 --> 01:28:57,104
Exiled man! About tin.
- What?

1302
01:28:57,178 --> 01:28:58,236
About tin.

1303
01:28:58,313 --> 01:29:01,111
"Sir, it is not tin but turn."

1304
01:29:01,182 --> 01:29:03,776
"Yes, that only. Turn. Go."

1305
01:29:04,052 --> 01:29:05,246
"Dharmu, you go this way."

1306
01:29:05,387 --> 01:29:07,321
About tin. Go on. Go.

1307
01:29:08,857 --> 01:29:10,256
They will do Ramlila.

1308
01:29:10,392 --> 01:29:11,723
If I hadn't kept moustache
I would have done...

1309
01:29:11,793 --> 01:29:12,851
...the role of Ram.

1310
01:29:26,474 --> 01:29:29,875
"Brother, tell me now where
you were taking me."

1311
01:29:30,211 --> 01:29:31,405
And what is the reason for
conflict between us.

1312
01:29:31,746 --> 01:29:33,737
"I don't have any quarrel
with you, brother."

1313
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:37,408
Makhan Singh said that if I
had you over to him then...

1314
01:29:37,485 --> 01:29:38,952
"...I will get 50,000 rupees."

1315
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:40,078
"50,000?
- Yes."

1316
01:29:40,221 --> 01:29:41,745
This is a very profitable business.

1317
01:29:41,956 --> 01:29:43,014
"Tell me, are you ready to
share the money 50-50."

1318
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:44,955
What do you mean?
- We will keep half-half amount.

1319
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:46,752
"No, brother. I need 50,000 rupees."

1320
01:29:46,828 --> 01:29:47,886
I need it badly.

1321
01:29:48,096 --> 01:29:50,155
"And what if you get
more than 50,000."

1322
01:29:50,365 --> 01:29:51,423
How is that?

1323
01:29:51,499 --> 01:29:54,093
"Look, this Chakradhari
will plot on scheme."

1324
01:29:54,369 --> 01:29:57,099
This scheme will go on and we
will keep getting the money.

1325
01:29:57,772 --> 01:30:00,900
Hold this and take
me to Makhan Singh.

1326
01:30:02,577 --> 01:30:03,976
Hey! Walk properly!

1327
01:30:04,779 --> 01:30:06,178
Just a little bit.

1328
01:30:07,315 --> 01:30:08,373
Thakur!

1329
01:30:13,321 --> 01:30:16,119
"Thakur, you told me
to bring him alive."

1330
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:17,349
Therefore it took some time.

1331
01:30:17,859 --> 01:30:19,793
Or else I would have dumped
his corpse yesterday...

1332
01:30:19,861 --> 01:30:21,055
...at your doorstep.

1333
01:30:22,197 --> 01:30:23,255
Why are you laughing?

1334
01:30:23,998 --> 01:30:26,262
Everything is open here.
There is no door.

1335
01:30:26,334 --> 01:30:28,802
There are 4 mountains.
And couple of horses.

1336
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:29,928
You talk a lot.

1337
01:30:30,004 --> 01:30:31,198
I had only hobby in my childhood.

1338
01:30:31,272 --> 01:30:32,330
To talk.

1339
01:30:32,407 --> 01:30:34,398
When I was born I
said straightaway...

1340
01:30:34,476 --> 01:30:35,966
...where am I?

1341
01:30:36,044 --> 01:30:37,136
"Beemar Singh?
- Yes, boss."

1342
01:30:39,814 --> 01:30:41,941
"Brother dacoit, if this is the
Beemar (Weak) Singh then..."

1343
01:30:42,016 --> 01:30:43,950
...don't call Mr. Strong Singh.

1344
01:30:44,018 --> 01:30:45,417
I will shut you up now.

1345
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:47,819
"No, Thakur. You can do
whatever you want to..."

1346
01:30:47,889 --> 01:30:48,947
...do with him.

1347
01:30:49,157 --> 01:30:50,886
"But first give me my 50,000 rupees."

1348
01:30:51,092 --> 01:30:52,218
"Uncle.
- Yes, son."

1349
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:54,219
Take this Beemar Singh.

1350
01:30:54,429 --> 01:30:56,488
Take this. Your reward.

1351
01:30:56,898 --> 01:30:59,025
It is not my reward but my
earning of my hard work.

1352
01:30:59,367 --> 01:31:02,427
I have also worked hard.
I should get half amount.

1353
01:31:02,570 --> 01:31:04,367
We have many bullets for you.

1354
01:31:05,173 --> 01:31:06,435
"Tell me, how much do you want?"

1355
01:31:06,908 --> 01:31:08,239
Not today. Today I am fasting.

1356
01:31:08,309 --> 01:31:09,776
I have kept fast to get good wife.

1357
01:31:12,113 --> 01:31:13,774
"No. No, Thakur. Don't
do this sinful act..."

1358
01:31:13,848 --> 01:31:14,906
...as you are a warrior.

1359
01:31:15,316 --> 01:31:18,513
At least ask him his last
wish then you can kill him.

1360
01:31:19,988 --> 01:31:21,922
Alright. I will listen to you.

1361
01:31:23,391 --> 01:31:25,256
"Tell me, Chakradhari, what
kind of death you want?"

1362
01:31:26,461 --> 01:31:27,519
A grand death.

1363
01:31:28,463 --> 01:31:30,055
Since childhood I has the
desire to die like...

1364
01:31:30,131 --> 01:31:31,996
...great personalities.

1365
01:31:32,867 --> 01:31:36,394
Therefore I have made
my neck big and strong.

1366
01:31:37,806 --> 01:31:39,398
I want to be hanged.

1367
01:31:40,942 --> 01:31:44,878
Beemar Singh. Fulfill the last
wish of this dying man.

1368
01:31:46,214 --> 01:31:48,148
Find a strong branch on
that tree and hang...

1369
01:31:48,216 --> 01:31:50,081
...this plaintiff there.

1370
01:31:52,487 --> 01:31:54,079
"Thank you, darling Thakur."

1371
01:31:56,157 --> 01:31:57,556
"Bye, bye, darling Dharmu."

1372
01:31:59,027 --> 01:32:00,756
"Come on, darling Beemar."

1373
01:32:03,031 --> 01:32:06,364
"Thakur, Thakur. First let
me go far from here."

1374
01:32:07,101 --> 01:32:08,966
I can't bear to see
a man getting hanged.

1375
01:32:10,772 --> 01:32:11,830
Go away.

1376
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:26,913
"Yes, Chakradhari. Did
you like the noose?"

1377
01:32:27,121 --> 01:32:28,383
"Yes, it is very good."

1378
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:31,384
Now the only regret is that
your neck will be elongated.

1379
01:32:31,459 --> 01:32:32,983
What is there to feel regret?

1380
01:32:33,194 --> 01:32:36,254
Since childhood I wanted
to have a long neck.

1381
01:32:36,798 --> 01:32:37,856
Really?
- Yes.

1382
01:32:38,066 --> 01:32:40,125
"So, should I tell him to
drive the jeep? - Yes."

1383
01:32:41,135 --> 01:32:42,796
"Plaintiff, start the jeep."

1384
01:32:42,871 --> 01:32:44,270
Put it in the first gear then drive.

1385
01:33:29,347 --> 01:33:30,405
Kishanlal is coming.

1386
01:33:30,482 --> 01:33:31,676
Throw it. Throw it.
- No.

1387
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:33,012
If he catches you with so
much money then he will...

1388
01:33:33,084 --> 01:33:34,142
...send you again in prison.

1389
01:33:34,219 --> 01:33:35,413
"Throw it.
- No, no. This is my..."

1390
01:33:40,525 --> 01:33:44,552
Exiled man! Are you doing
Ramlila drama again?

1391
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:48,227
"Dharmu, he is that Hanuman
who can even spoil Ram."

1392
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:51,426
What are you two talking about
in this deserted place?

1393
01:33:51,536 --> 01:33:53,265
"We are doing "Bharat Milap"

1394
01:33:53,338 --> 01:33:54,396
"Yes, we are doing Bharat Milap."

1395
01:33:54,472 --> 01:33:57,703
Exiled man. If I tight
my temper then...

1396
01:33:58,143 --> 01:33:59,167
"Say, 'Iose my temper."'

1397
01:33:59,244 --> 01:34:00,541
Yes. If I love my temper then
I won't let you two...

1398
01:34:00,612 --> 01:34:02,204
...do any dramas.

1399
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:04,043
Understood. Now go from here.

1400
01:34:04,149 --> 01:34:05,639
Not this way. Today
you go this side.

1401
01:34:06,484 --> 01:34:07,781
"Dharmu, you go this way."

1402
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,480
Come. Get out.

1403
01:34:40,752 --> 01:34:42,743
It's gone. The bundle of money
is washed away by the water.

1404
01:34:43,588 --> 01:34:48,582
My money was going to be
wasted anyhow in liquor.

1405
01:34:49,094 --> 01:34:51,494
But it shouldn't have happened
with a decent boy like you.

1406
01:34:52,330 --> 01:34:55,299
Tell me one thing. Why you
need this much money?

1407
01:34:57,202 --> 01:34:58,260
Tell me.

1408
01:35:03,742 --> 01:35:05,107
Tears in your eyes.

1409
01:35:05,710 --> 01:35:09,544
I am unfortunate. I became
orphan after birth.

1410
01:35:10,515 --> 01:35:12,710
I became a thief for the woman
whom I respected as...

1411
01:35:12,784 --> 01:35:14,649
...my mother.
- Thief?

1412
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:16,478
Yes.

1413
01:35:17,188 --> 01:35:19,554
All her jewelries were
stolen from me.

1414
01:35:20,058 --> 01:35:22,720
I did steal it brother.
But someone deceived me...

1415
01:35:22,794 --> 01:35:24,557
...and took all the jewelries.

1416
01:35:25,997 --> 01:35:27,988
And your mother didn't believe you.

1417
01:35:28,433 --> 01:35:31,266
Mother would have believe
me but that accountant...

1418
01:35:31,336 --> 01:35:32,997
...kept on inciting her.

1419
01:35:33,672 --> 01:35:37,506
"He said, landlady, I told you
not to trust the servants."

1420
01:35:39,411 --> 01:35:42,346
And my mother was innocent.
She came under his influence.

1421
01:35:43,448 --> 01:35:48,681
"She said, go Dharmu.
Get out of the house."

1422
01:35:50,088 --> 01:35:53,489
And from today consider you
have lost your mother.

1423
01:35:55,026 --> 01:35:57,586
"But brother, I can't lose
my mother. Brother."

1424
01:35:58,463 --> 01:36:01,159
"To tell you the truth, in
this entire world I have..."

1425
01:36:01,232 --> 01:36:03,530
...nothing else besides my mother.

1426
01:36:04,169 --> 01:36:05,363
I am nothing.

1427
01:36:08,773 --> 01:36:10,502
"You are still lucky, friend."

1428
01:36:11,710 --> 01:36:13,541
You have someone to call your own.

1429
01:36:14,346 --> 01:36:17,509
Look at me. I don't have anyone
to call me brother.

1430
01:36:17,582 --> 01:36:19,516
Nor anyone to call me a son.

1431
01:36:20,218 --> 01:36:22,049
"But brother, I have become
orphan in spite of..."

1432
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:23,212
...having a mother.

1433
01:36:24,456 --> 01:36:27,152
My mother will think of me as a
thief till I repay the money...

1434
01:36:27,225 --> 01:36:28,556
...and free the bungalow
from mortgage.

1435
01:36:28,693 --> 01:36:30,217
She won't call me son.

1436
01:36:31,629 --> 01:36:32,994
"Don't worry, friend."

1437
01:36:33,732 --> 01:36:37,168
"Look, you want 50,000 rupees.
- Yes."

1438
01:36:39,471 --> 01:36:41,996
Now your mother doesn't
have only one son...

1439
01:36:42,073 --> 01:36:43,131
...but 2 sons.

1440
01:36:43,575 --> 01:36:45,509
"I will get 50,000 rupees for you."

1441
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:48,103
Your mother will call you son again.

1442
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:49,438
But brother.
- I will do plot some scheme.

1443
01:36:49,514 --> 01:36:50,606
You just wait and watch.

1444
01:36:51,149 --> 01:36:52,377
Let's go to Makhan Singh.

1445
01:36:52,450 --> 01:36:54,748
"Thakur, I have caught him again."

1446
01:36:55,387 --> 01:36:58,015
This time hang him properly.

1447
01:36:58,523 --> 01:37:01,492
If he escapes this time then
he will surely kill me.

1448
01:37:03,128 --> 01:37:05,096
You said that if I catch
him again then you will...

1449
01:37:05,163 --> 01:37:06,630
"...give me 50,000 again."

1450
01:37:06,698 --> 01:37:08,290
"So, now give me the money
for my hard labor."

1451
01:37:10,368 --> 01:37:11,426
Take this.

1452
01:37:11,536 --> 01:37:12,594
That's the spirit.

1453
01:37:12,670 --> 01:37:13,728
Hold this.

1454
01:37:21,179 --> 01:37:24,307
What? Won't you tell me the
last wish of the dying man?

1455
01:37:26,351 --> 01:37:29,047
What can I say? Ask this criminal?

1456
01:37:31,456 --> 01:37:33,515
This time he is not
the only criminal.

1457
01:37:34,359 --> 01:37:35,724
There is one more along with him.

1458
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:42,531
Who? - The man who rescued
Chakradhari that day.

1459
01:37:50,108 --> 01:37:51,598
I will return after drinking water.

1460
01:37:57,582 --> 01:37:58,640
"Greetings, sir."

1461
01:37:59,017 --> 01:38:01,008
Greeting.
- Come back.

1462
01:38:12,764 --> 01:38:16,427
"Yes, Chakradhari. Now tell
me how you want to die."

1463
01:38:18,036 --> 01:38:19,765
Chakradhari's whole scheme
has been foiled.

1464
01:38:20,438 --> 01:38:22,235
Now I don't want to die.

1465
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:24,467
I want to live with your permission.

1466
01:38:24,776 --> 01:38:27,301
It is difficult. It
is very difficult.

1467
01:38:28,112 --> 01:38:31,707
"Anyway, Dharmu, do you also
have a childhood hobby..."

1468
01:38:31,783 --> 01:38:33,478
...just like your friend.

1469
01:38:35,053 --> 01:38:36,350
"If you have any interest,
then tell me."

1470
01:38:36,421 --> 01:38:38,514
I will fulfill that interest.
Tell me.

1471
01:38:39,324 --> 01:38:40,382
You don't have.

1472
01:38:41,459 --> 01:38:43,222
But I have an old childhood hobby.

1473
01:38:43,995 --> 01:38:46,589
Ask me about it. Ask.

1474
01:38:47,465 --> 01:38:48,989
"You fool, ask."

1475
01:38:49,067 --> 01:38:50,659
What?
- What?

1476
01:38:54,005 --> 01:38:58,374
I want to kill two men
with one bullet.

1477
01:39:00,378 --> 01:39:02,107
Now come in front of your friend.

1478
01:39:02,747 --> 01:39:04,078
Come in the front.

1479
01:40:23,461 --> 01:40:25,224
My friend. My friend.

1480
01:40:25,463 --> 01:40:27,454
You are punching this wall so
hard as if there is money...

1481
01:40:27,532 --> 01:40:30,228
...inside and which will come
out when you will punch it.

1482
01:40:30,969 --> 01:40:32,459
"It cannot be solved with
anger, my friend."

1483
01:40:33,037 --> 01:40:34,402
Use your brain. Brain.

1484
01:40:35,273 --> 01:40:38,208
I think that you will get your
mother's bungalow back.

1485
01:40:39,077 --> 01:40:41,045
"But, how?
- I got news."

1486
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:45,973
On full moon night a group
of tribal men are...

1487
01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:48,382
...bringing lots of weapons.
Guns and etc.

1488
01:40:48,653 --> 01:40:50,644
And Makhan Singh and
his men will come...

1489
01:40:50,722 --> 01:40:53,350
...to buy that weapons from them.

1490
01:40:53,992 --> 01:40:55,584
You and I...

1491
01:41:36,634 --> 01:41:39,364
"Bingo, Bingo, Bingo."

1492
01:41:39,437 --> 01:41:41,962
"I am Bingo."

1493
01:41:43,174 --> 01:41:45,972
"Ringo, Ringo, Ringo."

1494
01:41:46,044 --> 01:41:48,444
"I am Ringo."

1495
01:41:50,081 --> 01:41:52,481
"Bingo, Bingo, Bingo."

1496
01:41:52,550 --> 01:41:54,984
"I am Bingo."

1497
01:41:56,587 --> 01:41:59,283
"Ringo, Ringo, Ringo."

1498
01:41:59,357 --> 01:42:01,985
"I am Ringo."

1499
01:42:02,593 --> 01:42:06,051
"I am Pappi and I am beautiful."

1500
01:42:06,130 --> 01:42:09,258
"Watch your every step."

1501
01:42:09,567 --> 01:42:12,593
"We will defeat them,
I swear on mother."

1502
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:16,731
"Swear on mother. Swear on mother."

1503
01:42:17,141 --> 01:42:20,008
"Bingo, Bingo, Bingo."

1504
01:42:20,078 --> 01:42:22,171
"I am Bingo."

1505
01:42:23,514 --> 01:42:26,278
"Ringo, Ringo, Ringo."

1506
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:29,410
"I am Ringo."

1507
01:42:29,487 --> 01:42:32,945
"I am Pappi and I am beautiful."

1508
01:42:33,024 --> 01:42:35,959
"Watch your every step."

1509
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:39,186
"We will defeat them,
I swear on mother."

1510
01:42:39,263 --> 01:42:43,290
"Swear on mother. Swear on mother."

1511
01:43:20,171 --> 01:43:23,504
"This urban girl is full of charms."

1512
01:43:23,574 --> 01:43:27,010
"She might steal your heart."

1513
01:43:27,078 --> 01:43:30,172
"She is very young
with a slim waist."

1514
01:43:30,248 --> 01:43:33,217
"She has big, big eyes."

1515
01:43:33,518 --> 01:43:36,681
"This urban girl is full of charms."

1516
01:43:36,754 --> 01:43:40,155
"She might steal your heart."

1517
01:43:40,224 --> 01:43:43,387
"She is very young
with a slim waist."

1518
01:43:43,461 --> 01:43:46,521
"She has big, big eyes."

1519
01:43:47,098 --> 01:43:49,328
"My dear, you are a liar."

1520
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:52,028
"Don't say lie in front of me."

1521
01:43:53,137 --> 01:43:56,300
"This Pappi seems to be shameless."

1522
01:43:56,574 --> 01:43:59,600
"We would also become merciless."

1523
01:44:00,044 --> 01:44:03,172
"We will defeat them,
I swear on mother."

1524
01:44:03,247 --> 01:44:07,206
"Swear on mother. Swear on mother."

1525
01:44:07,552 --> 01:44:10,214
"Bingo, Bingo, Bingo."

1526
01:44:10,288 --> 01:44:12,415
"I am Bingo."

1527
01:44:14,058 --> 01:44:16,720
"Ringo, Ringo, Ringo."

1528
01:44:16,794 --> 01:44:19,558
"I am Ringo."

1529
01:45:20,524 --> 01:45:24,119
"She dances merrily spreading
her charms everywhere."

1530
01:45:24,195 --> 01:45:27,289
"My eyes are enticed by her."

1531
01:45:27,365 --> 01:45:33,668
"I will tell the truth. I like you
but you are little immature."

1532
01:45:34,105 --> 01:45:37,336
"She dances merrily spreading
her charms everywhere."

1533
01:45:37,408 --> 01:45:40,571
"My eyes are enticed by her."

1534
01:45:40,645 --> 01:45:47,483
"I will tell the truth. I like you
but you are little immature."

1535
01:45:47,585 --> 01:45:51,180
"Get aside. I will cut you
into pieces if you think..."

1536
01:45:51,255 --> 01:45:53,018
"...that I am immature."

1537
01:45:53,758 --> 01:45:57,216
"This Pappi seems to
be little angry."

1538
01:45:57,328 --> 01:46:00,593
"But her heart seems to be soft."

1539
01:46:00,665 --> 01:46:03,691
"We will defeat them,
I swear on mother."

1540
01:46:03,768 --> 01:46:08,034
"Swear on mother. Swear on mother."

1541
01:46:08,339 --> 01:46:11,137
"Bingo, Bingo, Bingo."

1542
01:46:11,208 --> 01:46:13,369
"I am Bingo."

1543
01:46:14,745 --> 01:46:17,646
"Ringo, Ringo, Ringo."

1544
01:46:17,715 --> 01:46:20,616
"I am Ringo."

1545
01:46:21,185 --> 01:46:24,154
"I am Pappi and I am beautiful."

1546
01:46:24,255 --> 01:46:27,452
"Watch your every step."

1547
01:46:27,525 --> 01:46:30,460
"We will defeat them,
I swear on mother."

1548
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:35,124
"Swear on mother. Swear on mother."

1549
01:46:59,523 --> 01:47:01,286
Now I am leaving. Let me go.

1550
01:47:01,359 --> 01:47:03,520
I won't let you go.
I won't let you go.

1551
01:47:03,594 --> 01:47:06,028
Singing and dancing is over.
My work is done.

1552
01:47:06,097 --> 01:47:08,657
I won't let you go.
You will stay here.

1553
01:47:08,733 --> 01:47:10,758
And you will marry me.

1554
01:47:11,302 --> 01:47:13,167
Mother!
- I won't let you go.

1555
01:47:13,237 --> 01:47:14,295
Father.

1556
01:47:14,372 --> 01:47:16,670
O God! O God! Thank you very much.

1557
01:47:16,741 --> 01:47:18,038
Thank you million times.

1558
01:47:18,109 --> 01:47:19,167
At last she has selected a boy.

1559
01:47:19,643 --> 01:47:21,110
"Son-in-law, don't refuse."

1560
01:47:22,046 --> 01:47:24,105
"Brothers, should we marry them.
- Yes!"

1561
01:47:25,216 --> 01:47:28,652
"But... but sir, I am a very bad man."

1562
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:30,311
No problem.
- No problem.

1563
01:47:30,988 --> 01:47:32,046
I drink liquor.

1564
01:47:32,123 --> 01:47:33,647
No problem.
- No problem.

1565
01:47:33,724 --> 01:47:35,055
I gamble.

1566
01:47:35,126 --> 01:47:36,991
No problem.
- No problem.

1567
01:47:37,461 --> 01:47:39,326
I go to brothels. Brothels.

1568
01:47:39,397 --> 01:47:41,126
No problem.
- No problem.

1569
01:47:41,198 --> 01:47:42,256
I smoke drugs.

1570
01:47:42,333 --> 01:47:44,597
No problem.
- No problem.

1571
01:47:45,102 --> 01:47:46,467
There is one more problem.
- What?

1572
01:47:46,537 --> 01:47:48,505
I already have 10 wives.
If I marry her then...

1573
01:47:48,572 --> 01:47:49,664
...the total will be 14.

1574
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:53,005
No problem.
- No problem.

1575
01:47:53,077 --> 01:47:54,669
Then I have to go.
- No.

1576
01:47:54,745 --> 01:47:57,009
Where are you going?
We won't let you go.

1577
01:47:57,081 --> 01:47:59,345
"Dear brothers, lock him inside
the cage. - Yes, yes."

1578
01:47:59,417 --> 01:48:03,353
"Take him. - Merciless, why
don't all of you marry her."

1579
01:48:04,088 --> 01:48:07,546
"The bird is in the cage and
the hunter is smiling."

1580
01:48:07,625 --> 01:48:08,683
Son-in-law.
- Yes.

1581
01:48:08,759 --> 01:48:10,021
Think about it carefully.
- Yes.

1582
01:48:10,094 --> 01:48:13,393
You will be locked in this cage
till you say yes. - Alright.

1583
01:48:13,464 --> 01:48:15,159
"Come on, brothers.
- Go, brothers."

1584
01:48:16,033 --> 01:48:19,560
"It is hard to say and
hard to keep quiet."

1585
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:30,642
This is the first souvenir
of my love.

1586
01:48:32,349 --> 01:48:33,441
How sweet!

1587
01:48:34,151 --> 01:48:39,316
This is the last souvenir
of my love. Yes.

1588
01:48:39,490 --> 01:48:41,981
I need some time to think.

1589
01:48:42,093 --> 01:48:44,425
Right now you go and have
fun with this. Go.

1590
01:48:44,495 --> 01:48:45,985
"Can I go?
- Yes, go."

1591
01:48:46,063 --> 01:48:47,325
Can I go?
- Go.

1592
01:48:47,598 --> 01:48:49,395
"Alright, don't refuse."

1593
01:48:50,234 --> 01:48:51,394
You naughty.

1594
01:48:51,635 --> 01:48:54,001
Come again. Don't come.

1595
01:48:59,009 --> 01:49:04,242
I think this ring and I
are related for eternity.

1596
01:49:26,303 --> 01:49:28,168
"Dharmu, why are you here?"

1597
01:49:28,439 --> 01:49:31,135
"Inspector, come with
me to the bungalow."

1598
01:49:31,308 --> 01:49:32,468
To the bungalow?
- Why?

1599
01:49:32,543 --> 01:49:35,307
"I have brought 50,000 rupees
to give to the contractor."

1600
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:37,971
You give mother's bungalow
back to her.

1601
01:49:40,284 --> 01:49:41,342
"Did you see, sister?"

1602
01:49:41,418 --> 01:49:44,387
Inspector Kishanlal knew that
Dharmu is a nice boy.

1603
01:49:44,455 --> 01:49:46,650
He has a sinless soul. He
can't do the robbery.

1604
01:49:46,724 --> 01:49:49,522
"Yes, inspector. I am not a thief."

1605
01:49:50,728 --> 01:49:52,355
How can I steal?

1606
01:49:53,164 --> 01:49:56,224
My mother didn't teach me stealing.

1607
01:49:57,735 --> 01:49:59,430
Still I was accused of theft.

1608
01:50:00,671 --> 01:50:03,231
"I am not sad because of that
accusation, inspector."

1609
01:50:03,707 --> 01:50:06,676
I am only sad because my
mother believed that...

1610
01:50:06,744 --> 01:50:08,336
...I had stolen those jewelries.

1611
01:50:09,113 --> 01:50:11,581
If I had done that robbery then
I would not have gone to...

1612
01:50:11,649 --> 01:50:14,641
...prison for not paying
a fine of 500 rupees.

1613
01:50:15,686 --> 01:50:18,348
If I had the money then
I wouldn't have fought...

1614
01:50:18,422 --> 01:50:19,480
...with the dacoits putting
my life in danger...

1615
01:50:19,557 --> 01:50:22,526
...to free mother's bungalow
from mortgage.

1616
01:50:24,461 --> 01:50:27,021
Now I have the money.
I will prove that...

1617
01:50:27,097 --> 01:50:28,394
...I am not the thief.

1618
01:50:29,967 --> 01:50:35,371
"But inspector, from where can
I bring the trust that..."

1619
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:36,963
...my mother had lost.

1620
01:50:38,409 --> 01:50:40,172
"She is upset with me, inspector."

1621
01:50:40,644 --> 01:50:45,581
"Therefore he said that,
go Dharmu. From today..."

1622
01:50:45,649 --> 01:50:47,640
...you have lost your mother.

1623
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:51,313
"How can I her believe me, inspector?"

1624
01:50:52,256 --> 01:50:53,484
How can I appease her?

1625
01:50:54,191 --> 01:50:58,992
I don't have even God in this
world but I only have...

1626
01:50:59,063 --> 01:51:00,621
...mother. Mother.

1627
01:51:05,002 --> 01:51:07,493
"Dharmu, please forgive me, son."

1628
01:51:07,738 --> 01:51:12,198
Forgive me.
- Mother. Mother.

1629
01:51:23,354 --> 01:51:27,620
"Take this 50,000 and evacuate
my mother's bungalow."

1630
01:51:30,361 --> 01:51:31,623
Hail chief Balwant!

1631
01:51:31,695 --> 01:51:34,687
Hail chief Balwant!

1632
01:51:38,969 --> 01:51:40,027
Where is Badal Singh?

1633
01:51:40,104 --> 01:51:41,969
"Chief, we gave him the
news of your arrival."

1634
01:51:42,039 --> 01:51:43,097
He will come soon.

1635
01:51:44,108 --> 01:51:45,166
He will come soon!

1636
01:51:45,242 --> 01:51:46,300
Why isn't he here yet?

1637
01:51:46,377 --> 01:51:48,106
"Sir, the bungalow slipped
out of our hands."

1638
01:51:49,079 --> 01:51:52,207
But I have kept these jewelries
of the landlady safely.

1639
01:51:52,283 --> 01:51:53,409
Landlady's jewelries?

1640
01:51:53,484 --> 01:51:54,542
Take this.

1641
01:52:11,568 --> 01:52:13,331
Listen. There was a ring
among the jewelries.

1642
01:52:13,504 --> 01:52:14,596
Whom did you tell to do this work?

1643
01:52:14,672 --> 01:52:15,730
Kalu.

1644
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:17,632
Call Kalu quickly.

1645
01:52:18,142 --> 01:52:20,007
I kept that ring as my pocket-money.

1646
01:52:20,244 --> 01:52:21,302
I lost it while gambling.

1647
01:52:22,012 --> 01:52:24,003
You lost it while gambling. To whom?

1648
01:52:24,081 --> 01:52:25,070
Chakradhari.

1649
01:52:25,149 --> 01:52:28,118
"Fool, that ring is worth
more than your life."

1650
01:52:35,693 --> 01:52:40,323
"Makhan Singh, I want Chakradhari.
Alive."

1651
01:52:43,334 --> 01:52:46,531
I don't want to do it. Leave me.

1652
01:52:46,603 --> 01:52:47,695
Leave me.

1653
01:53:33,217 --> 01:53:37,278
"Thank you, my friend. Hey!"

1654
01:53:40,290 --> 01:53:41,621
You have fooled Chakradhari.

1655
01:53:42,226 --> 01:53:44,217
I think there is my ancestors'
soul in it.

1656
01:53:45,496 --> 01:53:47,555
I got freedom by giving one ring.

1657
01:53:49,433 --> 01:53:51,298
"Chakradhari, where were you?"

1658
01:53:51,702 --> 01:53:52,760
I was looking to look for you.

1659
01:53:53,103 --> 01:53:54,695
You can think that Lord
Bajrangbali saved me.

1660
01:53:55,239 --> 01:53:57,298
"Brother, I am grateful to you."

1661
01:53:57,374 --> 01:53:58,432
How can you be full?

1662
01:53:58,642 --> 01:54:00,576
That chief's daughter
is full and I am full.

1663
01:54:00,644 --> 01:54:01,702
How can you be full?

1664
01:54:01,779 --> 01:54:04,577
"Brother, because of you my mother
got back her bungalow."

1665
01:54:04,648 --> 01:54:05,706
And I got my mother.

1666
01:54:05,783 --> 01:54:07,580
Come. I will introduce
you to my mother.

1667
01:54:07,651 --> 01:54:08,709
Come. Come. Come.

1668
01:54:47,691 --> 01:54:50,353
"She is Dharmu's mother, chief.
- What?"

1669
01:54:52,362 --> 01:54:55,092
I have killed her husband
and son long time back.

1670
01:54:55,432 --> 01:54:57,161
When did she give birth
to this Dharmu?

1671
01:54:57,234 --> 01:54:58,292
I will tell you.

1672
01:54:58,569 --> 01:55:01,367
"He is that Parvati's son,
whom you killed."

1673
01:55:01,705 --> 01:55:03,229
But he calls me mother.

1674
01:55:04,107 --> 01:55:06,302
And you are his scoundrel father.

1675
01:55:06,376 --> 01:55:09,368
"Landlady, I have many such
sons in many streets."

1676
01:55:10,314 --> 01:55:12,782
"If you like to be called mother,
then I will send more sons."

1677
01:55:13,116 --> 01:55:14,174
Balwant!

1678
01:55:14,251 --> 01:55:15,309
"Don't scream, landlady."

1679
01:55:15,719 --> 01:55:17,380
Right now I want Chakradhari.

1680
01:55:18,121 --> 01:55:20,055
And I have heard that he
is your son Dharmu's...

1681
01:55:20,123 --> 01:55:21,181
...best friend.

1682
01:55:24,528 --> 01:55:27,986
"Villagers, tell Dharmu that
if he wants to see his..."

1683
01:55:28,065 --> 01:55:34,004
...mother alive then tomorrow
before sunrise he should...

1684
01:55:34,071 --> 01:55:37,472
...come at Makhan's den
with Chakradhari.

1685
01:55:37,541 --> 01:55:38,735
Come.

1686
01:55:42,546 --> 01:55:44,070
"He took ring from my hand...
- Brother Dharmu, brother Dharmu."

1687
01:55:44,147 --> 01:55:45,341
All villagers are looking for you.

1688
01:55:45,415 --> 01:55:46,473
Why? What happened?

1689
01:55:46,550 --> 01:55:47,744
Balwant Singh kidnapped landlady.

1690
01:55:48,485 --> 01:55:49,543
Who is Balwant Singh?

1691
01:55:49,686 --> 01:55:52,018
The landlady was saying that
Balwant Singh is your father...

1692
01:55:52,089 --> 01:55:53,488
...and he killed your real mother.

1693
01:55:55,559 --> 01:55:59,427
He is my father. He
killed my mother.

1694
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:05,034
He said that if you don't
reach Makhan Singh's den...

1695
01:56:05,102 --> 01:56:06,626
...before sunrise along with
Chakradhari then he...

1696
01:56:06,703 --> 01:56:07,761
...will kill the landlady.

1697
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:11,039
I couldn't save the mother
that gave birth to me...

1698
01:56:11,108 --> 01:56:16,045
But I will have to kill that
sinner to save the mother...

1699
01:56:16,113 --> 01:56:17,580
...that raised me.

1700
01:56:18,115 --> 01:56:22,051
We have to conquer this
battlefield not with...

1701
01:56:22,119 --> 01:56:23,780
...vigor but with wisdom.

1702
01:56:24,588 --> 01:56:30,254
"First think, why does Balwant
Singh needs Chakradhari?"

1703
01:56:38,201 --> 01:56:42,069
"Makhan Singh, go upstairs
and wait for both of them."

1704
01:56:43,073 --> 01:56:45,007
When Dharmu comes with Chakradhari...

1705
01:56:45,075 --> 01:56:47,202
...you get that ring from him
with love and come to me.

1706
01:56:47,277 --> 01:56:48,335
Go.
- Alright.

1707
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:52,014
"So, contractor. What happened to..."

1708
01:56:52,082 --> 01:56:53,413
...that entertainment program?

1709
01:56:53,684 --> 01:56:55,015
"Chief, I have brought such
a girl from the city..."

1710
01:56:55,085 --> 01:56:57,610
...that will gave your heart
with her dancing style.

1711
01:56:58,221 --> 01:56:59,688
Really?
- Her name is Anarkali.

1712
01:57:00,223 --> 01:57:01,554
Anarkali?
- Yes.

1713
01:57:05,095 --> 01:57:06,289
Come Chakradhari.

1714
01:57:06,363 --> 01:57:07,557
Don't call me Chakradhari
(bearer of disc).

1715
01:57:07,698 --> 01:57:09,563
The disc is lost in the battlefield.

1716
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:11,565
Only this body is left.

1717
01:57:11,635 --> 01:57:13,500
Tell your chief that I
am brought Chakradhari.

1718
01:57:14,104 --> 01:57:16,095
And return my mother to me.
- Alright.

1719
01:57:16,173 --> 01:57:17,231
"Listen, brother. Listen."

1720
01:57:17,441 --> 01:57:18,499
Think about it.

1721
01:57:18,709 --> 01:57:20,574
It involves your life and death too.

1722
01:57:21,111 --> 01:57:22,169
How is that?

1723
01:57:22,245 --> 01:57:25,180
I am also a hooligan. You
are also a hooligan.

1724
01:57:26,049 --> 01:57:28,711
Both of us should think about
each other's profit.

1725
01:57:30,053 --> 01:57:32,988
What I mean to say is that
he brought me here...

1726
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:34,114
...for his own profit.

1727
01:57:34,257 --> 01:57:37,055
You will hand me over to
your boss for his profit.

1728
01:57:37,527 --> 01:57:39,722
Who will be in loss? You and I.

1729
01:57:40,063 --> 01:57:41,325
And both of them will be profited.

1730
01:57:41,531 --> 01:57:43,590
Just think. We will only
lose our lives. - Yes.

1731
01:57:43,667 --> 01:57:44,725
He is right.

1732
01:57:45,469 --> 01:57:47,266
"Now tell me, my friends.
It is right."

1733
01:57:47,537 --> 01:57:49,061
"It is justice.
- No, no."

1734
01:57:49,139 --> 01:57:50,197
Never.

1735
01:57:50,674 --> 01:57:53,666
Don't you have a union?
- What is this union?

1736
01:57:54,077 --> 01:57:56,409
This is the reason why rural
dacoits are lagging behind?

1737
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:58,079
You don't understand this.

1738
01:57:58,148 --> 01:57:59,206
Look.

1739
01:57:59,282 --> 01:58:01,750
He was a rural dacoit.
I took him to the city.

1740
01:58:02,085 --> 01:58:03,484
In the union of urban dacoits.

1741
01:58:03,687 --> 01:58:05,416
There he registered his name.

1742
01:58:05,489 --> 01:58:07,081
Now look at what he has become.

1743
01:58:07,157 --> 01:58:08,215
Doesn't he look like a hero?

1744
01:58:08,291 --> 01:58:09,349
Turn around. Turn around.

1745
01:58:09,426 --> 01:58:11,223
Yes. What did this man do there?

1746
01:58:11,428 --> 01:58:14,363
He registered his name there.
He shouted few slogans.

1747
01:58:14,564 --> 01:58:17,032
"He started getting salary, TA, DA..."

1748
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:18,158
"...provident fund, everything."

1749
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:20,427
Now we have to shout
2 slogans. Listen.

1750
01:58:20,570 --> 01:58:22,231
Hail union of dacoits!

1751
01:58:22,305 --> 01:58:24,239
Fulfill our demands!

1752
01:58:24,441 --> 01:58:26,238
Hail union of dacoits!

1753
01:58:26,376 --> 01:58:28,037
Fulfill our demands!

1754
01:58:28,111 --> 01:58:33,310
What is happening there? Why
are you shouting like dogs?

1755
01:58:33,650 --> 01:58:35,982
Listen. He is saying to you
that you are shouting...

1756
01:58:36,053 --> 01:58:37,111
...and barking like dogs.

1757
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:38,981
If you had a union then
he would have dared...

1758
01:58:39,056 --> 01:58:40,182
...to talk to you like this.

1759
01:58:40,323 --> 01:58:42,314
If he had said so you could
have gone on strike.

1760
01:58:42,392 --> 01:58:45,452
Strike of dacoits. No firing of
bullets. No looting. Total...

1761
01:58:45,529 --> 01:58:46,655
"Hey, Chakradhari!
- Yes, sir."

1762
01:58:47,064 --> 01:58:48,122
What are you saying?

1763
01:58:48,198 --> 01:58:49,256
"Nothing, sir."

1764
01:58:49,332 --> 01:58:50,526
I was giving them the message
of Gita (holy book).

1765
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:51,658
Message of Gita.
- Yes.

1766
01:58:51,735 --> 01:58:53,066
It is a very good thing.

1767
01:58:53,136 --> 01:58:55,001
Come inside. Eat food and give me...

1768
01:58:55,072 --> 01:58:56,130
...the sermon of Gita.

1769
01:58:56,206 --> 01:58:57,264
Let's go. Let's go.

1770
01:58:57,340 --> 01:58:58,398
"Let's go, brother."

1771
01:58:58,475 --> 01:58:59,533
"Dharmu, you also come along."

1772
01:58:59,609 --> 01:59:00,667
Come.

1773
01:59:01,344 --> 01:59:04,211
Did you hear? Now he will take
me inside and incite me.

1774
01:59:04,281 --> 01:59:07,011
He will give me food and tell
me that all my dacoits...

1775
01:59:07,084 --> 01:59:09,552
...are impotent. They
don't know anything.

1776
01:59:09,686 --> 01:59:11,551
Hail union of dacoits!
- Right.

1777
01:59:11,621 --> 01:59:13,145
Hail union of dacoits!

1778
01:59:13,223 --> 01:59:15,157
We will make our own union.

1779
01:59:21,164 --> 01:59:22,358
"Come, Chakradhari. Sit.
- Yes."

1780
01:59:22,432 --> 01:59:23,490
The food is very delicious.

1781
01:59:23,567 --> 01:59:26,092
"You are great, brother dacoit.
You are great."

1782
01:59:26,503 --> 01:59:29,961
"Look, so many times we had
conflicts but still you are..."

1783
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:31,701
...so kind and hospitable.

1784
01:59:32,309 --> 01:59:34,368
"Chakradhari, I will be hospitable
to you every day."

1785
01:59:35,312 --> 01:59:39,043
Our chief said that you have a ring.

1786
01:59:39,516 --> 01:59:41,984
And for that ring the chief
is willing to give you...

1787
01:59:42,052 --> 01:59:43,451
...as much money as you want.

1788
01:59:47,190 --> 01:59:49,249
"Look, they have done it..."

1789
01:59:49,526 --> 01:59:51,187
Those people... ring.

1790
01:59:51,528 --> 01:59:53,996
They took the ring from my
hand while shaking hands...

1791
01:59:54,064 --> 01:59:55,531
"...with me.
- Yes, yes."

1792
01:59:56,666 --> 01:59:58,531
There are even pick-pockets
among your dacoits.

1793
01:59:58,602 --> 02:00:02,732
That ring...
- It has been stolen. Stolen.

1794
02:00:03,073 --> 02:00:04,404
That ring is stolen. You
cannot get that ring now.

1795
02:00:04,541 --> 02:00:06,475
I will take it from them.
- No. You can't take it.

1796
02:00:06,543 --> 02:00:09,273
They are disloyal.
- I will teach them a lesson.

1797
02:00:09,479 --> 02:00:12,346
"They were saying, scoundrel.
- Son of a dog."

1798
02:00:12,415 --> 02:00:13,746
We will whack you.

1799
02:00:14,551 --> 02:00:16,485
I will go and see who has
the courage to confront me.

1800
02:00:16,553 --> 02:00:18,282
They said that you
can't do anything.

1801
02:00:18,355 --> 02:00:19,413
You... you are nothing.

1802
02:00:19,489 --> 02:00:20,615
I am nothing?
- No.

1803
02:00:20,690 --> 02:00:22,157
I will go and tell them who I am.

1804
02:00:22,559 --> 02:00:24,493
"You fools, come here."

1805
02:00:25,095 --> 02:00:28,155
'You fools' this is
not a good curse.

1806
02:00:28,498 --> 02:00:32,025
"Call their fathers and mothers
dog, pig and donkey."

1807
02:00:32,435 --> 02:00:34,027
"Sons of pig, come here."

1808
02:00:35,438 --> 02:00:36,496
Did you see that?

1809
02:00:36,573 --> 02:00:40,168
"They are walking slowly, which is
the first sign of disloyalty."

1810
02:00:40,310 --> 02:00:41,504
Tell them to come quickly.

1811
02:00:41,578 --> 02:00:44,376
Are you disloyal? Can't
you come quickly?

1812
02:00:48,051 --> 02:00:49,109
Give one more curse.

1813
02:00:49,519 --> 02:00:50,577
Sons of donkey.

1814
02:00:52,189 --> 02:00:55,647
"Listen, one of you have
Chakradhari's ring."

1815
02:00:56,526 --> 02:00:57,584
I want that ring.

1816
02:00:57,661 --> 02:00:59,060
Take it out of your pocket
and give it to me.

1817
02:01:00,197 --> 02:01:01,528
They won't give this way.

1818
02:01:02,065 --> 02:01:03,532
First give them some greed. Greed.

1819
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:05,659
"Tell them, give me the ring I
will give you 20,000 rupees."

1820
02:01:06,069 --> 02:01:07,468
"20,000?
- Who has to give?"

1821
02:01:07,537 --> 02:01:08,595
You only have to say that.

1822
02:01:08,672 --> 02:01:09,730
You just tell them.

1823
02:01:10,207 --> 02:01:11,265
They are scoundrel dacoits.

1824
02:01:11,541 --> 02:01:15,136
"I will give 20,000 rupees to
you if will give me the ring."

1825
02:01:16,079 --> 02:01:17,740
Take it out.
- Show it to me.

1826
02:01:19,216 --> 02:01:20,274
It won't work this way.

1827
02:01:21,351 --> 02:01:23,080
They only understand beating.

1828
02:01:23,353 --> 02:01:25,014
Tell them to recover the ring
after beating each other...

1829
02:01:28,425 --> 02:01:30,950
Listen. Beat each other
and search the pockets...

1830
02:01:31,027 --> 02:01:32,153
...and get the ring.

1831
02:01:32,629 --> 02:01:34,028
I should hear the sound
of the punches.

1832
02:01:34,297 --> 02:01:35,559
Beat them hard.

1833
02:01:49,512 --> 02:01:50,570
You fool.

1834
02:01:51,581 --> 02:01:53,446
Tell me where my mother is.

1835
02:01:54,517 --> 02:01:55,711
You cannot go there.

1836
02:01:56,119 --> 02:01:57,518
You will be shot if you go there.

1837
02:01:58,521 --> 02:02:00,113
You just tell me the address.

1838
02:02:00,323 --> 02:02:03,053
Chakradhari will think of a plan
to avoid the bullets. Tell me.

1839
02:02:03,393 --> 02:02:05,258
There is a stair near
the railway gate.

1840
02:02:14,604 --> 02:02:16,469
Contractor. Present it.

1841
02:02:23,213 --> 02:02:28,344
"One innocent, young, virgin, girl."

1842
02:02:29,019 --> 02:02:34,355
"She was raised and brought
him very lavishly."

1843
02:02:35,158 --> 02:02:41,097
"On seeing her everyone
becomes crazy."

1844
02:02:41,631 --> 02:02:48,366
"She is the Anarkali
of Mugal-e-Azam."

1845
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:52,031
"I am presenting..."

1846
02:02:52,309 --> 02:02:56,507
"I am presenting such
a beauty, sir."

1847
02:02:56,579 --> 02:03:00,709
"On seeing her you will sweat
with excitement, sir."

1848
02:03:09,526 --> 02:03:13,724
"You would have not seen
such a beauty, sir..."

1849
02:03:13,797 --> 02:03:18,063
"...that would have made you
sweat with excitement, sir."

1850
02:03:18,268 --> 02:03:24,332
"I am presenting such
a beauty, sir."

1851
02:03:24,541 --> 02:03:28,602
"On seeing her you will sweat
with excitement, sir."

1852
02:04:03,646 --> 02:04:10,176
"Nandlal teased me
on the river bank."

1853
02:04:11,388 --> 02:04:15,222
"On the river bank."

1854
02:04:15,291 --> 02:04:20,786
"He twisted my delicate wrist."

1855
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:25,597
"On the river bank."

1856
02:04:27,003 --> 02:04:29,267
"On the river bank."

1857
02:04:39,582 --> 02:04:44,019
"This chiseled body, this
waist and this age."

1858
02:04:47,557 --> 02:04:52,187
"You sharp glance is
just like a sword."

1859
02:04:55,665 --> 02:04:59,601
"She descended from the
heaven by mistake."

1860
02:04:59,702 --> 02:05:04,264
"By breaking the stone-hearts
of moon and stars."

1861
02:05:07,777 --> 02:05:11,645
"She walks like a swaying mountain."

1862
02:05:11,714 --> 02:05:15,582
"She would crush the hearts of
the lovers under her feet."

1863
02:05:15,785 --> 02:05:19,687
"Earthquakes come when
she dances merrily."

1864
02:05:19,756 --> 02:05:24,216
"When she sways her waist,
the earth and sky shake."

1865
02:05:27,730 --> 02:05:33,726
"Even the core of the mountain
could be destroyed..."

1866
02:05:33,803 --> 02:05:38,069
"...with the effect of
her glance. Her glance."

1867
02:05:38,141 --> 02:05:42,077
"You would have not seen
such a beauty, sir..."

1868
02:05:42,145 --> 02:05:46,081
"...that would have made you
sweat with excitement, sir."

1869
02:05:46,182 --> 02:05:50,084
"I am presenting such
a beauty, sir."

1870
02:05:50,186 --> 02:05:54,520
"On seeing her you will sweat
with excitement, sir."

1871
02:06:09,205 --> 02:06:12,106
"Don't fear if you are in love."

1872
02:06:12,175 --> 02:06:16,544
"Don't fear if you are in love."

1873
02:06:16,679 --> 02:06:20,376
"I will die only after
killing everyone."

1874
02:06:20,517 --> 02:06:23,543
"There is no point in dying alone."

1875
02:06:23,620 --> 02:06:27,386
"Don't fear if you are in love."

1876
02:06:27,457 --> 02:06:30,984
"Don't fear if you are in love."

1877
02:06:39,469 --> 02:06:43,496
"She is unique, she is storm
and she is Armageddon."

1878
02:06:47,377 --> 02:06:52,007
"She is the merciless
mischief of nature."

1879
02:06:55,485 --> 02:06:59,285
"Many men have died
here in her love."

1880
02:06:59,355 --> 02:07:03,689
"She is a trouble.
She is a problem."

1881
02:07:07,197 --> 02:07:11,258
"She has taken hearts
of millions here."

1882
02:07:11,334 --> 02:07:15,293
"Many kings of the world
are crazy for her."

1883
02:07:15,371 --> 02:07:19,239
"Everyone gets surprised
on seeing her."

1884
02:07:19,309 --> 02:07:23,541
"Wherever she goes, battles
are fought for her."

1885
02:07:27,150 --> 02:07:33,282
"We will be faced with
the judgment day."

1886
02:07:33,356 --> 02:07:37,122
"It is very difficult
for you live now, sir."

1887
02:07:37,193 --> 02:07:41,061
"You would have not seen
such a beauty, sir..."

1888
02:07:41,130 --> 02:07:44,657
"...that would have made you
sweat with excitement, sir."

1889
02:07:45,001 --> 02:07:48,562
"I am presenting such
a beauty, sir."

1890
02:07:48,705 --> 02:07:53,165
"On seeing her you will sweat
with excitement, sir."

1891
02:08:45,361 --> 02:08:47,386
"Hail union of dacoits!
- Good, good."

1892
02:08:47,463 --> 02:08:48,987
"Hail union of dacoits!
- Good, good."

1893
02:08:49,132 --> 02:08:50,656
Hey! You are making a fool us.

1894
02:08:51,401 --> 02:08:53,335
There is not need to
make a fool of you.

1895
02:08:53,736 --> 02:08:56,068
"You are already a fool,
made by the God."

1896
02:08:56,139 --> 02:08:57,197
That is right.

1897
02:09:37,980 --> 02:09:39,504
Hey! What's that?

1898
02:09:54,130 --> 02:09:55,188
Thank you.

1899
02:09:56,466 --> 02:09:57,524
"Sorry, sorry."

1900
02:09:57,734 --> 02:09:59,531
It is nothing. I just did like this.

1901
02:10:23,092 --> 02:10:24,184
Son Dharmu.

1902
02:10:25,061 --> 02:10:27,154
Look at this. This is
a map of the treasure.

1903
02:10:28,197 --> 02:10:30,461
Landlord has written that
with the treasure money...

1904
02:10:30,533 --> 02:10:32,330
...we have to make a Hanuman temple.

1905
02:10:32,435 --> 02:10:33,959
A grand temple.

1906
02:10:36,038 --> 02:10:38,404
"Mother, mother."

1907
02:10:40,977 --> 02:10:43,070
"Mother, mother."

1908
02:10:45,148 --> 02:10:46,206
Don't worry about me.

1909
02:10:46,315 --> 02:10:48,215
You chase that Balwant.

1910
02:13:12,662 --> 02:13:13,720
Halt!

1911
02:13:14,263 --> 02:13:15,992
Drop your guns.

1912
02:13:31,113 --> 02:13:33,104
Treasure. I found the treasure.

1913
02:13:33,316 --> 02:13:35,682
Lord Bajrang Bali. I didn't
have faith on you.

1914
02:13:36,218 --> 02:13:38,015
But you have given me the treasure.

1915
02:13:38,321 --> 02:13:39,379
I will go mad.

1916
02:13:42,024 --> 02:13:43,150
I found the treasure.

1917
02:14:11,354 --> 02:14:14,050
"Dharmu, save this treasure
which belongs to God."

1918
02:14:14,190 --> 02:14:15,248
I bind you with your mother's swear.
