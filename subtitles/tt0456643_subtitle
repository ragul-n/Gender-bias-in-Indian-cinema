1
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:12,561
You are a poem hidden in my eyes.

2
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:20,545
When Cauvery flows and clouds thunder.
It's you in my heart.

3
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:28,747
When the clouds melt, you are the
rain drop reaching earth.

4
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:36,755
You are the first woman to
strike a chord in my heart.

5
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:43,033
My life is dedicated to reach you.

6
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:46,362
Mother!

7
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,471
Have you started it so early?

8
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:48,163
Be careful.

9
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,001
Brother, one more please.

10
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,869
If we work little hard, we can
understand Arabic Language also.

11
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:55,842
If we work hard little more.

12
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,448
We can understand a
woman's heart also.

13
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,208
But, I can never
understand this boy.

14
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,486
When every one else studies,
he plays.

15
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,485
When everyone else is playing,
look, he's writing something.

16
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,486
Why are you saying like this?

17
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,090
I never said anything wrong.

18
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,420
If he reforms at least after this
festival that's enough for me.

19
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,292
Okay, tell them to burst crackers
wearing new clothes. - Okay.

20
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,094
Come in.
- Coming mother.

21
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,270
Sathyam, come and wear clothes.

22
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,936
Not that, new clothes.

23
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,504
If we wear, it will become old.
Let them be new for some more time.

24
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:29,179
You must become the light of my eye
and shine in my life everyday.

25
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,819
What's that? Give it me.

26
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:39,957
Oh God! Devil.

27
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,923
Rogue! You are a young boy.

28
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,363
Started fooling around already.

29
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,935
What happened madam?

30
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,174
Your son has written a love letter
to my daughter.

31
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,434
I must first take you to task.

32
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,636
What a great way to bring up a son.

33
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:01,905
Come in...

34
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,339
Will you write a love letter, rascal?

35
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,482
I didn't write, father.
- I saw you writing.

36
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,381
Will anyone with a pen and paper
write a love letter only?

37
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,213
I didn't write, father.

38
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,890
Are you lying to me? - I am not, father.
- Repeating the same.

39
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,956
You believe others,
but never believe me.

40
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,752
Fathers generally beat
when sons lie.

41
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,361
But you are beating me
for telling the truth.

42
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:19,421
Yuck!

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,630
Brother!

44
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,159
Why did father beat you?
- For telling the truth.

45
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,837
Take my Deepavali gift.

46
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,566
He got just 3 marks in English.

47
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,767
If he gets marks like this,
he will not become an Engineer.

48
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,912
He may end up as
a grease assistant.

49
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:34,977
Shameless creature!

50
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,079
Can't he reform seeing his elder...

51
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,816
Go...how much hard work he would've
put to get these 3 marks?

52
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,452
He would be very hungry, poor boy.

53
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,012
Go!

54
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,292
Are you feeling sad son?

55
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,088
Why?

56
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,027
You failed in English.
- I know it.

57
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:54,928
What?

58
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,101
I had written it, hadn't l?

59
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,532
If you improve your English...
- Why do you always stress on English?

60
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,263
90 in Telugu, 80 in Maths,
75 in Social studies.

61
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,304
Can't you appreciate that?

62
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,532
I hate English.

63
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,211
English is not knowledge,
it's just another language.

64
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,106
Just because every one in England
speak English, are they all scholars?

65
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,282
That is alright son.

66
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,484
But, you'll pass annual exams and go to
10th class only if you pass in English.

67
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,654
Then, I will never go to 10th
till she comes reaches.

68
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,117
You don't worry brother.

69
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,587
I will not go to 10th class
till you go to 10th class.

70
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,582
Come...sit down.

71
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,802
Swathi! Who will remove the plate
after eating? Remove it.

72
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,635
What am I to do living here?

73
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,334
I am planning to sell this
house and go away.

74
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,069
Vacating the house suddenly is...

75
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:41,975
You are right.

76
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,080
Who will buy a house
when tenants are there?

77
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,083
Do one thing, buy it yourself.
- Me?

78
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,418
How can I buy
a Rs.10 lakh worth house?

79
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,790
My savings and jewels may come
up to 6 or 7 lakhs only.

80
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:55,858
What's this sir?

81
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,893
I am quoting Rs.10 lakhs to others.

82
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,724
I am ready to sell it at
Rs.8 lakhs for you.

83
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,457
Deal is over. I will arrange
the shortfall.

84
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,068
Select an auspicious day
for registration.

85
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,895
You are going that side, aren't you?
Come, I will drop you. I'll go.

86
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,605
Father, I have got a
interview call letter.

87
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,144
Where's the interview?

88
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,908
Pour...pour more water.

89
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,314
How much ever you add,
it's colour will not change...

90
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:24,518
Greetings brother.

91
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,584
What do you want?
- Rs.500 loan.

92
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:27,620
You can't, can you?

93
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,517
Give me a tea.

94
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,663
Tea is Rs.3 from today.
- Why?

95
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,564
It's Rs.4 there.

96
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,390
That is quality tea.
What about your tea?

97
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:39,662
Milk, Tea and sugar
prices have gone up.

98
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,006
But cup size has never grown.

99
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,371
You are maintaining the same size.
So, I'll also pay the same old rate only.

100
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,244
What? Rs.2.50?

101
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,278
It's that 50 Paise
which is profit to me.

102
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:51,875
Take it.

103
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,884
What is this?
- Your profit.

104
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,019
My goodness!

105
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,349
You are thinking so deeply.
Is it about girls?

106
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,725
No, about America.

107
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:03,759
You don't worry.

108
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,124
Someday you will go to America
and I will become a writer.

109
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,160
What about me then?

110
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,568
Your neighbour house uncle will
come back from Dubai

111
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:10,701
and you will be caught red-handed.

112
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:13,870
No problem.

113
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,438
They say something in English...

114
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,139
Dog has made me remember.

115
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,837
Our MLA needs a driver.
Can you drive?

116
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:22,912
I can drive closing my eyes.

117
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:27,018
If you drive closing your eyes,
I will die.

118
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,346
What happens next?

119
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,714
My wife will become an MLA
in the by-election.

120
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,691
Really? Then, offer him the
job immediately.

121
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,918
Walk out from here.

122
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,458
Go inside.

123
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:38,855
You come.

124
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,225
Why did you come so late?

125
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,661
I came day before yesterday,
you weren't here.

126
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,733
Okay, join on a good auspicious day.

127
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,171
Greetings sir.
- Give me the car keys sir.

128
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,300
Good is not in the day,
it is in the heart.

129
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,171
Didn't get the job? No problem.

130
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,346
I attended 25 interviews
before getting this job.

131
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,981
Father...father.
- Leave it...don't shout.

132
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:57,910
What is the matter?

133
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,618
I got a job.
- Say it loud.

134
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,612
I got a job.

135
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,313
Who offered job to a
3 times failed 10th class guy?

136
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,494
Why are you still taunting me
about failing 10th class?

137
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,562
Graduates are roaming unemployed.

138
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:12,559
Forget about that.

139
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,632
You are a post graduate. Did you become
an officer? You are still a clerk.

140
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,860
You said you've got a job.
Happy to hear that.

141
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,901
Can't you ask what's the job?

142
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,234
What is your job?

143
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,966
I am the driver to our MLA.

144
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,006
Great job!

145
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,440
Why are you sad like
a deflated balloon?

146
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:29,974
Didn't you get the job?

147
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,678
Why are you worried about him?

148
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,717
Take this money and
deposit it in Bank.

149
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,860
Try to understand me brother-in-law.

150
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,530
They want me to pay
by today evening.

151
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:47,831
Will you definitely send
by Wednesday?

152
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,931
Okay, your wish.

153
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,801
I am running short of money...

154
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,869
What is it? Why are you dull?

155
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,769
What to say?
My horoscope is really bad.

156
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,377
Anything coming into my hand
never reaches my mouth.

157
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,444
Say it in short.

158
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,774
I have got an offer to
go to America.

159
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,041
I must pay Rs.1 lakh by today evening.

160
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,115
Couldn't you ask your
brother-in-law?

161
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,287
Doesn't he know it?
He had arranged this.

162
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,456
It seems he will send on Wednesday.
After everything is over.

163
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,619
Bad fate!

164
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,693
Can't you ask any of your friend?

165
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,021
Why would a man lending
lakhs become my friend?

166
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,462
That is also true.

167
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,059
Will your brother-in-law surely pay
the money by Wednesday?

168
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,534
You are asking as if
you will give me money.

169
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:27,364
I will give.

170
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,772
What are you waiting for,
inauspicious time is fast approaching.

171
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,576
Sathyam has gone to get money.
Let him come.

172
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,247
Let's finish the formalities
in the mean time.

173
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,584
No, we will follow rules.

174
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,979
Registration will go on only after
I pay you the full money.

175
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,656
Okay, you wait for him.
We will finish the formalities.

176
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,324
Come in.

177
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:47,957
Where is he?

178
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,864
There is Mr.Gopal our neighbour
who helps his wife and you are useless.

179
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,866
Excuse me.
- What?

180
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,070
People living in this house?

181
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,740
That boy is not here,
he has gone to America.

182
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,033
His parents have gone to
their native place.

183
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,402
I don't know any other thing.

184
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,010
I am vexed answering people
inquiring about him.

185
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,737
Whom are you talking to?

186
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:09,744
I am coming.

187
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,974
Any man other than you
is my brother.

188
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,846
Don't get tensed up.
He will come, you come in.

189
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:16,983
No...

190
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:18,982
Come.

191
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,215
Sign here.

192
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,590
You have bagged a good property.

193
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:29,195
Vishwanandham, we had settled
for Rs.8 lakhs. - Yes.

194
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,661
There are 7 lakhs only.

195
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,732
7 lakhs only?
- Where is another lakh?

196
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,340
Fell short, father.

197
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,532
What? A lakh fell short.

198
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,908
What are you saying?

199
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,273
That is...

200
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,207
That is.

201
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,473
Why has your face turned pale?

202
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,674
Tell me, what happened?

203
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,779
You settle the problem outside.

204
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,951
I really gave him Rs.8 lakhs.

205
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,126
But, he...

206
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:58,463
Sir, give me a week's time.
I will arrange it.

207
00:09:58,664 --> 00:09:59,790
You have arranged these funds
mortgaging everything.

208
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,626
How can you arrange
it in one week?

209
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,301
I am planning to take
voluntary retirement.

210
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,468
He loves me more than you all.

211
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,472
That's why he is getting me retired
with still 8 years of service.

212
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,645
What's this father? You are saying
as if I had done it wantonly.

213
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,815
Lakshmi, tell him to stop
talking to me from today.

214
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:17,812
What's this?

215
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,485
As a father it's my responsibility,
so I'll take care of his food.

216
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,655
No need. I'll earn for my food.

217
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:24,652
What is this?

218
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:25,824
What's wrong in this?

219
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,493
I had helped my friend as his
friends are helping him.

220
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,161
He is a good man, so he will
return the money.

221
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,830
My friend was a cheat,
so he cheated me.

222
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,828
Who is he?
- You don't know him.

223
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,500
Tell him to be little patient.

224
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,168
I will repay his money in a year.

225
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,670
Sathyam, you were
very active earlier.

226
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,339
Why are you dull like a
post-election poster?

227
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,339
Nothing sir.

228
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,510
Shall I stop the car?

229
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:49,840
Is it an ambulance?

230
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,516
If he dies?
- I'll lose just a vote.

231
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,344
Why are you talking like this
though you are an MLA?

232
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,520
That's why I am going
to Assembly...move on.

233
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:58,019
You are talking too much.
Why are you staring?

234
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:58,849
Go.

235
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,520
Hey, stop the car...stop.

236
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,363
Will you throw me out of my own car

237
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:06,861
and take a stranger in my car?

238
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:11,025
You don't know about me.
I will not spare you.

239
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,872
I have also applied to the company.

240
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,707
I haven't got any intimation
from them till now.

241
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,551
Are you Sathyam?
- Sathyam isn't here.

242
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:35,890
What? What?

243
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,993
Who are you? What is all this?

244
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,397
Why are you rising alarm?
- Brother!

245
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,400
Where is your son?
- Who are you all?

246
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,071
Tell me, what's all this?
- Tell me.

247
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,745
Tell your son, we will kill him.

248
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:54,742
Move.

249
00:11:58,617 --> 00:11:59,413
Move man.

250
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,746
How dare to insult our
MLA on the road?

251
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:03,421
We couldn't get him.

252
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:04,418
Who is he?

253
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,922
Greetings brother.
- Give me a cigarette.

254
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,759
Take...no, brother.

255
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,590
Need any help from MLA?

256
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,425
How long can I run in
this petty shop?

257
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:15,759
If you recommend to MLA and
help in getting a loan.

258
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,435
I want to turn it into a big shop.

259
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,431
Good idea, but it will not work out.

260
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:21,632
I have lost my job.

261
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,775
Have you lost your job?
- Stop.

262
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,440
I am out of mood.
Let's go to a bar.

263
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,137
Move...go away.

264
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,444
What's their problem?

265
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,276
Father, don't feel sad.

266
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,612
Say something, father.

267
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:37,952
Have you come son?

268
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,789
Look at the condition the house.

269
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,451
What sins have we done to
embarrass us in public?

270
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,799
Everyone in this house is losing
peace because of you.

271
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,470
Your father never faced
any bad word against him.

272
00:12:55,841 --> 00:13:00,642
Today, he was beaten up
by street rowdies.

273
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,644
Where?

274
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,288
Will you dare to beat my father?

275
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,261
Bloody!

276
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,501
Will you dare to beat my father?

277
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,028
Stop I say.
Will you beat my father?

278
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,123
You came searching my house.

279
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,295
Beat me! I am Sathyam.

280
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,294
Where are you running away? Stop.

281
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,128
Bloody rogues.
I'll kill if I get you.

282
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:38,810
Stop.

283
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:42,981
Will you beat my father?

284
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,485
Beat me. I am Sathyam.

285
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,823
Beat me. I am Sathyam.

286
00:14:53,192 --> 00:15:00,325
Beat me.

287
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,159
Where are you running away?

288
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:06,834
Stop. I will kill you.
Dogs of MLA.

289
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,507
What a great son!

290
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:16,848
Stop.

291
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,351
Where are you coming in?

292
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,678
Isn'tit enough to ruin
my honour in public?

293
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,855
If they go to police.

294
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,524
Do you want to drag me to
police stations and courts?

295
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,686
Your mother committed a mistake
by giving birth to you.

296
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,197
I committed a mistake by failing
to bring you up properly

297
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,858
and I am now getting
punished for it.

298
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,202
We have had enough of you.

299
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:37,869
Go...get out.

300
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,196
What is this father?
He beat them for you only.

301
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,373
They beat me for him.

302
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,039
Mother!

303
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:49,544
I am not in his heart ever since
he stopped talking to me.

304
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,709
Staying in this house or not
is of no consequence to me.

305
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,044
I am going.

306
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:57,384
Come.

307
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,054
Ask brother not to go away.

308
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,055
Shut up and come inside.

309
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,395
Brother!

310
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:32,321

New look.

324
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,686
Always 'upma' only for breakfast.

325
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,020
Can't you prepare any
other breakfast?

326
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,196
More over it's very salty.

327
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,024
You are over doing things.

328
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:17,023
I married you because your
father fell at my feet.

329
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,205
Or else I wouldn't
have married you...

330
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,540

334
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,710
Don't make noise.
I will lose my respect.

335
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,879
Till now they were thinking
me as Manager Lingam.

336
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,211
They will now think.
I am henpecked husband Lingam.

337
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,887

- Why to comb hair?

place to keep money?

00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,696
...Narasimha Naidu.

354
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,867
Right sir.

355
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,366
Mother is lndiramma.
- You are right again.

356
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,705
Your sister is Vyjayanthi
and brother is Badri.

357
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:31,034
Your house No:13, Madhuranagaram,
Shanthi Nivasam, Hyderabad-33.

358
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,039
Yes sir.

359
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:33,878
Money?

360
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,546
You have Rs.500 in your pocket.
Give it to me.

361
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,374
How did you get that also right?

362
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,051
Face reading. Wait till this August.

363
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:40,718
After that?

364
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,386
September and October will follow.

365
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,384
Come and meet me then.

366
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:44,881
I will go now sir.

367
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,561
How could you predict it perfectly
like Nostradamus?

368
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:50,728
Do you really know
to read horoscopes?

369
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,228
I told that fool to bring horoscope
but he brought ration card.

370
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,893
I will not continue
in this profession.

371
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:00,230
An astrologer has predicted that
I will become C.M. in near future.

372
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,066
He might be someone
a fraud like you.

373
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,571
Are you here brother?

374
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:04,901
Do you know the news?

375
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,907
Song written by Sathyam has
won a Nandi award.

376
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,238
Is it?
- Open your mouth please.

377
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,413
Brother...brother.

378
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,245
He is here.
- What?

379
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,250
Have a sweet, brother.
- Why?

380
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,416
Your song has won
Nandi award, that's why.

381
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,089
I didn't win, Mr.Chakradhari has won it.

382
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,421
Though it's credited to his name,
you had written it, hadn't you?

383
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,257
Though I had written it, he had
given me the opportunity.

384
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,432
What opportunity?

385
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,931
He is using you and your talent.

386
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,932
If you hadn't written
the song for him.

387
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:33,764
Someone else would've written it.

388
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,599
I am just a taxi driver.

389
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,275
He gave me a job
recognizing my talent.

390
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,271
He introduced me to few
people in cinema field.

391
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:40,945
He's paying me.

392
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,613
He is not using me for free.

393
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,275
Once upon a time he was
also doing like me.

394
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,444
How can anyone become a
writer overnight?

395
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,113
Don't paint him
as a great villain.

396
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:51,452
Whatever you may say.

397
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,625
a great writer like you
isn't born till now.

398
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,287
Do you know all the writers
born earlier to me?

399
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,962
They only writer I know is you.

400
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,131
Do you at least know how many
like me come in future?

401
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,959
That is...
Shut up useless.

402
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:06,467
He doesn't know the past.
How can he say about future?

403
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,469
Why're you over doing things?

404
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:09,641
All you want is a party, isn't it?

405
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,469
My god! You have got it right.

406
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,812
I will.
- When? - Where?

407
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,140
I will ask a thing,
will you tell me truth?

408
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:17,974
What?

409
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,151
Does aunt beat you or vice-versa?

410
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,149
Why are you asking
such questions now?

411
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,482
Whenever she is angry,
she will beat me.

412
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,658
I will take it.

413
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,826
When I am really angry.

414
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,324
I will take it and
she will beat me.

415
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:39,497
My boss is sad of losing his
lover to another man.

416
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,333
Why are you making noise?
All we need is peace.

417
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,341
No, brandy.

418
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,840
Are you happy if strangers scold you?

419
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,513
Don't get enraged, uncle.
- What are you writing?

420
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,012
A new tune. I must write, mustn't l?

421
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,844
No need, you sing.
We will join you.

422
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,349
What about mood?

423
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,385
You want mood.
That is all isn't it? Watch now.

425

Drink country liquor raw.

426
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,436
Sky must get shaken up and
Sun must peep down.

427
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:14,101
Tell the truth after
drinking, beer, whisky and rum.

428
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:17,104
Open the fist sized heart
and share love.

429
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:29,119
God! World has changed.

TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

431
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,637
City girls wearing sleeveless
and mini skirts.

432
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,639
They drink in pubs and
claim it as culture.

433
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,302
say it is English culture.

434
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,978
They will hug a man seen in a party.

435
00:21:57,182 --> 00:22:01,585
After the party is over,
they dump him...dump him.

A posh Benz car will
go along the road.

438
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:41,515
People who lay those roads
live by it's side...live in hut.

439
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,190
Little huts have large hearts.

440
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:47,194
What do large palaces have
other than money?

441
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,866
Love is scarce there.

Man is worth till he is alive.

445
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:40,415
Why are you fighting among
yourself facing death?

446
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,916
Be friend people.

447
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:54,430
Enjoy life, buddy.

Punch like this and that.

450
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:32,464
Land into future with a girl.
Like this and that...

451
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,965
They accept love only
when your purse is full

452
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,971
and claim you are their life,
you are their heart beat.

453
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,643
They will knock you down.

454
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,479
They will paint future
with food, bed and kids.

455
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:45,309
Vanish into thin air as soon as
your purse is empty.

456
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:46,814
Ask you to leave them.

457
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:55,824
Oh god! Look at this world.

458
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,659
They refuse to go out on a bike

459
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:03,494
and readily agree if it is
an A/C car. They invite you.

460
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,170
If your purse is empty,
they will call you as brother.

461
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:07,395
Thrusting a wedding card
into your hands.

462
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,006
They will invite you
to their marriage.

463
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,674
They will say, come brother.

464
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:40,204
Excuse me, didn't anyone
of you call me?

465
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,132
Sorry sir, we got drunk and called you.

466
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,037
We didn't think you'll hear it.

467
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,270
I am tired. I am hungry.

468
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,214
What hungry?
purse is empty.

469
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,543
Do we've to go to bed
empty stomach?

470
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,549
I came without even
cooking at home.

471
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:00,917
Whose marriage it is?

472
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,525
Do you know them?
-l don't know.

473
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,197
If we are caught.
- We will say sorry, uncle.

474
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,126
Is your father doing fine?
He told me recently about you.

475
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,361
He died about 2 years ago.

476
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,199
I feel like I have
met him recently.

477
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,534
You don't take it seriously.
He'll always blabber like this only. Come.

478
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,535
Sit here.

479
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,543
No, it's not good to enjoy feast
in unknown people's marriage.

480
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,877
All lndians are brothers and sisters.

481
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,213
We will enjoy the feast and
bless the couple wholeheartedly.

482
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,218
Then, let's go and attack food.

483
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,051
Wait. All are sitting.
Let at least one of them get up.

484
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,052
I feel like we are doing wrong.

485
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,159
Whatever you may say
this is impossible.

486
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,386
This marriage must be stopped.

487
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,558
Don't stop marriage at this
juncture. It's unavoidable.

488
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,734
Are we at fault?
- The fault is not yours.

489
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,163
Why is he holding his hand and begging?

490
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,735
He should catch by his neck
and throw him out.

491
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,900
What will you do if it was
your sister's marriage.

492
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,399
I would beat them with slipper
and throw them out.

493
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:56,570
It is easier to say. What about the
girl's life? -What life!

494
00:26:56,881 --> 00:27:01,545
This is better than committing suicide
or taking divorce in future.

495
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,414
You can go.

496
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,858
Uncle, ask them to leave.

497
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:14,260
What will happen to her life if
marriage is stopped now?

498
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,592
Nothing will happen, uncle.

499
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:22,934
This is better than committing suicide
or taking divorce in future.

500
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,534
Is she your friend?
- Do you know her?

501
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,608
But she's repeating your dialogue.

502
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,539
My daughter loves him.

503
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,444
Come son.
- Come Shirisha!

504
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:39,453
People have come from far away
places to my daughter's marriage.

505
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:44,289
Let's take it as an occasion
for a get together.

506
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,292
Be happy.

507
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,455
Food is confirmed.

508
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,308
Why are you staring at us?
Are we look like thieves?

509
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,636
We are bride's father's
guests...serve me.

510
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,309
He is my friend.
- Serve some more.

511
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,011
How much? - Rs.5.
Give me one.

512
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:09,382
Do you have any sense?

513
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,312
No madam, will you lend me some?

514
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,389
How can I have it?
I am your sister, am I not?

515
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:16,560
Then, it's not our mistake,
it is our father's.

516
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,389
What are you doing here?
-I must ask you that.

517
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,066
Let anyone ask it.
It is the same thing.

518
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:26,564
It's the same thing, but I am seeing
you often all over city.

519
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:27,738
Have you fallen in love?

520
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,067
We don't have that much
leisure time, do we?

521
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:31,901
Will you fall in love
if you have time?

522
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:33,573
I will think over it.

523
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:36,008
Men must think twice before
falling in love with you.

524
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,745
Hey you...

525
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:40,849
What are you doing here?

526
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,246
Elder brother is having an
interview here. I came with him.

527
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,422
What happened to the
job he was doing?

528
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,089
It was a private bank,
they have folded up.

529
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,918
What happened to your
second proposal?

530
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,423
That guy!

531
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:50,761
Actually that guy...

532
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:53,096
No need to say,
I have understood.

533
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,932
How are you?

534
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,931
Just the same. Finding any
difference in me.

535
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,270
You will never change. Come.

536
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:01,772
I will go brother.

537
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:06,439
You will not change.
Why is he so serious?

538
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,436
Uncle Lingam's office.

539
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:13,277
Children, don't go anywhere.
I will meet your father and come.

540
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,286
When a dust speck fell
in my wife's eye,

541
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,456
I took her to a hospital.
It cost Rs.500 to me.

542
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,122
No problem. If she had seen
a silk sari with the same eye...

543
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:21,951
It would have cost you Rs.5000.

544
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,785
Who are you?

545
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:26,623
I am very close to Manager
uncle Lingam. - Uncle Lingam?

546
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:27,957
Don't you believe me?

547
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,796
Please sit down sir.

548
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,798
Please allow air to
blow between you both.

549
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,468
Don't they pay you in your office?
- We are paid.

550
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:35,969
She can wear full dress, can't she?

551
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,275
That is...our family issues...

552
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:38,965
Your family?

553
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,474
Oh no...
- Sit down.

554
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,809
Gossiping without working in office?

555
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,481
Isn't it wrong?
- It's wrong.

556
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:47,143
Don't you offer tea or
coffee to visitors?

557
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,915
Bring 2 coffees.
- One is enough.

558
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,146
Don't you want to have coffee sir?
- It is for me only.

559
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,492
You carry on with your work.

560
00:29:58,863 --> 00:29:59,329
Uncle.

561
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,558
Aren't you the Manager here?

562
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:04,835
Come. - What?

563
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,830
Come I say.
- Coffee is for you only.

564
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,500
What is it?

565
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,176
Did you take bribes they have
depromoted you to a peon?

566
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,609
I got this job after paying bribe.
Why did you come here?

567
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,010
Why then Manager Lingam name is
eliciting so much respect?

568
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,514
I and Manager both are Lingams.

569
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,185
But he is Bodilingam
and I am Kotilingam.

570
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,446
Why did you come here?
- Does Aunt know this?

571
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,853
Marriage to a face like mine
is very difficult.

572
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,526
If they come to know
I am peon, it's never.

573
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,524
So, I claimed myself as
the Manager Lingam.

574
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:32,696
She will divorce you
if she comes to know.

575
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,023
I am managing to keep
this a secret from her.

576
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,025
Have you become a manager like that?

577
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,531
Tell me, why did you come here?

578
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:42,035
One Mr. Ashok attended
an interview now. He's my brother.

579
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,865
Your brother!

580
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,372
Has he been selected?

581
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,376
No.
- Why?

582
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:47,870
Rs 20,000 bribe must be paid.

583
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,546
Did he promise to pay?
He said sorry.

584
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,874
I will pay that money.
Can you assure him a job?

585
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:55,541
You are a penniless man.
Do you want to buy a job? No jokes!

586
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:58,051
I have my own ways,
give me a week's time.

587
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,224
One week! lmpossible.

588
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:04,722
Jobs and working girls are in demand
like tickets to cricket matches.

589
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:05,896
lmpossible.

590
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,725
Is it final?
- Yes.

591
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,400
I will go.
- Okay go.

592
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,231
Your peon uniform is very good.

593
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,900
If aunt sees you in this uniform.

594
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,234
She will kill me if
she comes to know.

595
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,237
My boy listen to me.

596
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,744
If she comes to know she will
tell everyone in my office.

597
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,246
I can hold it for a week.

598
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:29,582
Don't tell aunt about this.

599
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:41,931
Brother! Tell us why did you stop?
- Wait!

600
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,770
Are you waiting for the bus?

601
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,370
It will rain before bus comes.

602
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,770
If you sit on my bike
I will drop you in college.

603
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,603
Don't worry about who's
first and who's last.

604
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,775
I'll drop one by one at college.

605
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:00,618
Is this your bike?

606
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:02,783
Did your father buy it for you?

607
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,120
Your father pays for it's
petrol also, isn't it?

608
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,292
If you give lift to girls on
your father's brought bike.

609
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:10,791
Your life will come an end.

610
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,622
Then, you can't even afford to
buy a cycle also to your son.

611
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,127
Go and mind your work.

612
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,800
Good show! Taught him a
good lesson.

613
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:20,630
Brother!- What?

614
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:26,136
What?
- What is it exactly?

615
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:27,644
Shut up.

616
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,254
What did you say sir
everyone is clapping hands.

617
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:42,481
I said I will not take lesson
till they stop clapping.

618
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:43,723
So they are...

619
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:45,496
What's the matter?

620
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,999
Stop! I have a message for you.

621
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,829
Not the lesson, but message
in the circular.

622
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:54,163
That is rectangle.

623
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,513
Participants can register
their names.

624
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:12,180
No sir.
- She's there sir.

625
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:18,855
Trying to be over smart.
- No...that is...

626
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,959
You are participating.

627
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,498
Everyone is doing fine.

628
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:08,746
You were excellent, you will get
the first prize this year also.

629
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:09,911
Only if I participate.

630
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:12,742
Not participating? Why?

631
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:14,744
Do I've to tell you
the reason?

632
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:18,255
I gave your name
as a participant.

633
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:21,084
Let it be! I will not participate.

634
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,927
Why did you practice then?

635
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:26,926
This is too much.

636
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,430
Hey! Boy! This year Ankita is also
participating with you.

637
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,100
We came here to know
the rehearsal time.

638
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:40,444
Any time!

639
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,279
Next week?

640
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,946
Did you see him?

641
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,119
I'll check new audio cassette
releases and come.

642
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,949
Music director feels it will good
if you write in recording theatre.

643
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,784
I may have to feel
if I come there.

644
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,290
Is it a cheque to sign at any place?

645
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,292
It's a song. I must chisel it.

646
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:04,465
Writing song is not an easy task.
You must get good mood.

647
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,797
You must get good thoughts.
You must get good words.

648
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:08,972
...Sathyam must come.

649
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,474
Other writers are writing, aren't they?

650
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:18,081
A good song or writing before you.
Which is important to you?

651
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:18,748
You wish sir.

652
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,814
I will call you later.

653
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,143
Keep it here only.
I will take it as advance.

654
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,320
It's a lakh sir.
- Words must come out mustn't they?

655
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,517
Become a writer quickly
I will become your driver.

656
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:29,955
I am a driver myself there's
mud on the bumper, clean it.

657
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,325
Greetings sir.

658
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:33,822
Why is he angry?

659
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,431
Can't you write and then
drink it, daddy?

660
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,837
I have promised daddy.

661
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:42,164
Why are you troubling
father early morning?

662
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:45,342
Look brother, he's refusing to write
a poem for school competition.

663
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:46,441
Write for her sir.

664
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,180
I don't have time.
- He will write.

665
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,349
When do you need it?
- Tomorrow.

666
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:57,177
It seems tomorrow! Promise her.
- Okay, I will do.

667
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,684
Answer it may be Raghavendra Rao.
- You come with me.

668
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,361
Do they've come all at a time?

669
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,357
Don't get tensed up,
you will win first prize. Coming sir...

670
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,863
This is Dutt's new tune, how is it?
- Looks familiar.

671
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:10,692
Surefire hit.

672
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,526
It must have good mass
appealing words.

673
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:13,362
When do you need it?

674
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:14,799
As early as possible.

675
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,870
By the way, Mani Sharma liked
your songs very much.

676
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:18,701
He promised to give two songs
credited to your name.

677
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,535
I said no.

678
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,546
You won't get frame for
just 2 songs.

679
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,874
Wait for an year I will get
your name in single card.

680
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,543
He will build another house in
the mean time using your songs.

681
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,549
Let him do it! What bothers you?

682
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:34,221
I need Rs 20,000 for
my brother's job...

683
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,883
I can give but our producers
give big bat like cheques,

684
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,723
It will get returned faster
than Pakistan bowlers.

685
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,231
I will give Dutt's song tomorrow.

686
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,409
You say it's for
your brother's job.

687
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,908
Give him the Rs 10,000 allocated
for house hold expenses.

688
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,740
Is it? Arrange balance else where
let's settle it later.

689
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,082
Go.

690
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,079
Give it to Deepa.
I will take leave sir.

691
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,752
Though smiles have vanished
from this world,

692
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,589
I love my mother
who wipes my tears.

693
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:14,931
Though I get spanked a lot,

694
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:17,430
I love to hold my father's
hand and walk.

695
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:20,604
I love my sister who smiles
like flower.

696
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,767
Though god has denied me to
enjoy them. I love god.

697
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:31,011
I love poetry that filters sorrows sea
into pure water.

698
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,614
No, it will not come to us.

699
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:38,448
It will go to near and dear ones
and those who pay bribes.

700
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,954
Do you know the questions
asked in the interview?

701
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:43,452
Do you know?

702
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:44,628
How many lice are there
in my son's hair?

703
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,126
How many bangles my
daughter's is wearing?

704
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,627
How many steps are in my office?

705
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,630
Do you call it as questions?
I am vexed!

706
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,132
I will never attend any
interview again in my life.

707
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:55,134
I don't want this job.
I will go away to States.

708
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:58,467
Kerala or Tamil Nadu state?
- United States of America.

709
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,303
My brain will be much valued there.

710
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,805
Yes, it will have high value.

711
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,811
Because till now it was never used.

712
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,813
You wasted so many sticks
to light a cigarette.

713
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,485
Can't you find another job? Get in.

714
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:09,311
Where?

715
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,992
Chakradhari wanted me to check
his new audio sales.

716
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:22,325
Listen me? I've already
heard this song.

717
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:34,674
Don't you've collections of
Athreya and Veturi hits? - No.

718
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,507
You've hit collections of heroes
and music directors?

719
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,108
Don't you've collections of lyricists?

720
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,181
We don't have madam.

721
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,189
How's Sahithi film audio sales?
- Fantastic sales sir.

722
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,085
There's only one left.

723
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:50,891
Do you want?

724
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,927
Come, let's go.

725
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,491
Look at this CD.
- I have already taken it.

726
00:38:58,803 --> 00:38:59,667
You are getting into
a mood, aren't you?

727
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,564
Me too.

728
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,438
If I had been a cricket commentator.

729
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,944
They are shameless.

730
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,013
You are brainless.

731
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,721
If you don't keep quiet, someday
they'll break your fine legs.

732
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:22,051
No problem. I will go to a hospital
with beautiful nurses.

733
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,560
Pick up 2 people at Ashok Hotel
and drop them at Medchal road.

734
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,324
You must meet Swathi.

735
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,360
It's just a drop, no problem.

736
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:40,940
Wait for few minutes.
We will go back.

737
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,570
You said a drop.
- Now, I say it's up and down.

738
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,544
Won't you agree? Wait man.

739
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,414
They haven't come back yet.
Swathi would be waiting there.

740
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:55,057
Didn't I warn you earlier?
Shall we go away?

741
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:56,218
It won't be good.

742
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,391
Come, let's tell them and go away.

743
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,289
Recently I gave just Rs.100
to your elder sister.

744
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,988
That's my elder sister.
- Okay, come.

745
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,125
Good! It's national permit
lorries outside.

746
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,236
Inside it's international
permit lorries.

747
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:08,871
Shall I inquire if they
are of any use to us?

748
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:09,937
Hey...no...

749
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,939
If we know the rates,
it may be useful in future.

750
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,475
If you want to get afflicted
with AlDS...then go ahead.

751
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,942
Great! Will Puliraju get AlDS?

752
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:18,645
You will never reform.

753
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,217
Why are you touching my money?

754
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,299
Stake your money here.

755
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,207
Didn't I tell you to wait?

756
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:49,335
How much you will pay if I win? - Why do
you want to know? - Tell me, sir.

757
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:50,475
Rs.5000.

758
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,477
Would you like to compete?
- Yes.

759
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,647
Have you gone mad?
We don't need all this crap.

760
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,484
Not for us. I need it badly.
- Punches?

761
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,758
No, money.

762
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:06,887
Can I also bet money?

763
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,894
My friend will lose...Rs.200.

764
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,908
That means, I have lost my money.

765
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:34,283
Don't rush.

766
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,401
Stop...stop man.
- Why are you stopping me?

767
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:26,735
You will get Rs.500 if you win.

768
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:29,208
But if you lose when we signal
you will get Rs.10,000.

769
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:32,880
Can I beat him till you
make the signal?

770
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,482
Beat him.

771
00:42:58,876 --> 00:42:59,934
What happened to you man?

772
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:02,941
You were going great guns,
beat him man...beat him.

773
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,124
Sathyam, what happened?

774
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,493
This is the last bus.

775
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,714
Buddy, look at that chic.

776
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:49,220
Bird is beautiful.
She is from Calcutta.

777
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,552
Tastes like Tamarind.

778
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:57,157
She's creating a
sensation in me.

779
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:00,068
If it's cold, can't you
close the window?

780
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,431
We must start earlier tomorrow.

781
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,608
Or else we can't
distribute the invitations.

782
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:08,978
You go to DSP uncle's house
alone. I will not come.

783
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:12,247
He has become very proud of late.
He trying to show off.

784
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:17,076
Smoking is prohibited in bus.

785
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:20,789
What happened again sir?

786
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:22,753
I think you were
singing some song.

787
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,688
No sir.

788
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:26,519
No problem... sing.
- No sir. - Sing.

789
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:32,699
What's your name dear?

790
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,598
Why hasn't Swathi
come home till now?

791
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:36,198
She would've come.

792
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:37,271
Wait man.

793
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,302
Lights are still on.
She wouldn't have come.

794
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:40,706
It's your mistake.

795
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,469
You brought me here directly
without going to the bus stop.

796
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,146
Come, let's go now.

797
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:43,938
Brother!

798
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,008
Why didn't you come at right time?

799
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:49,049
How did you get hurt?
- A small accident.

800
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,609
Accident?

801
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:51,986
Yes, accident.

802
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:54,448
Swathi...he is...

803
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:57,183
My name is Shankar.
Your sister's friend.

804
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,919
Few boys were teasing me in bus,
he saved me.

805
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:01,256
Thank you sir.

806
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:03,724
No thanks or sorry in friendship.

807
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,060
How can we be friends?

808
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:07,998
When his sister is my friend,
he is also my friend, isn't he?

809
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,433
Have you become a friend like that?

810
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,274
Any way I have become one.

811
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,233
By the way, what is your name?
- 'Petla'(Didn't).

812
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:14,968
You are grown up tall like
a pole not yet named?

813
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,476
My name is Sathish Petla.

814
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,375
Have you come like that?

815
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:21,784
You're still unemployed, aren't you?
- Has could you guess it so correctly sir?

816
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:23,043
By your tongue.

817
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,447
It's already late Swathi...
- I will drop her.

818
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:27,884
Anyway you can't go.

819
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:28,983
Are you shocked?

820
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,284
Swathi has told me everything.

821
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:36,260
Someday your father will
understand you. I have that hope.

822
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,229
I don't have it sir.

823
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,633
Okay brother, I am late already.

824
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,300
Get treated for those hurts.

825
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:52,276
If you had shouted like this
for the first punch.

826
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,450
You wouldn't have got
beaten up, would you?

827
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:57,586
If you had punched him,
he would've got sense.

828
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:58,881
and your brother
would have got job.

829
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:00,813
If I had done it.

830
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,990
Brother would've been at home and
I would've been in jail.

831
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,091
Okay, give me that juice.

832
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:05,587
Why have you started so early?

833
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,228
It is night in America.

834
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:08,991
If I become CM in future,

835
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:11,258
I would've to sit and drink
with George Bush.

836
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:12,127
Stop it man.

837
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:16,138
It seems you got hurt seriously
what happened?

838
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:17,533
It seems he has fight last night.

839
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,772
Who did I ask?
- Sathyam.

840
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,201
Why did you answer me?

841
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:24,775
Then, okay.

842
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:28,645
I am not able to
understand you Sathyam.

843
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:32,344
You write beautiful romantic songs
and get down to fights.

844
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,217
How can these two go together?

845
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:35,422
Sit down. I will explain.

846
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,322
Who wrote Ramanayam?
- Valmiki.

847
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:41,691
Before writing it?
- Thief.

848
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,333
Who is Ravana?
- A fiery villain in Ramayanam.

849
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:47,561
Does he have music taste?
- Why not? He is a great musician.

850
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,500
Why do you link courage and talent?

851
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,532
No nephew, I mean...

852
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:55,471
You are Manager of Durga lndustries.

853
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,112
But still don't you cook
at home or not?

854
00:46:58,448 --> 00:46:59,073
Are you or not?

855
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:02,382
I have got it.
- Then!

856
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,714
Why is he upside down
like a bat?

857
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,358
All are scolding him that his
brain is in the knees.

858
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,891
So, to make it fall
into its place.

859
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:13,528
Shut your mouth or else it will
sleep out of the mouth.

860
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:15,530
Rs.20,000.

861
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:17,757
My brother's job?
- It's his.

862
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:22,103
If your father comes to know
you'd helped to get this job.

863
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:23,534
He would misunderstand.

864
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,338
He wouldn't believe,
I had done it for love.

865
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,573
He would take it as I had done
it to impress him.

866
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,844
Anyway doing good is
a good thing.

867
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,475
But, publicizing is...

868
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:39,716
Why're you helping your father and mother,
who consider you as a bad character?

869
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:42,691
Just now you said
your father and your brother.

870
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:44,116
For that reason only.

871
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:45,795
You will never change brother.

872
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,293
Your brain has come to your head.
Get up.

873
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:50,056
Thanks father.

874
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,029
Take it Ashok.

875
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:54,363
Is he a clerk like me?
He is an officer.

876
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:58,063
Look son! Few know to cook very well.
But they will never cook.

877
00:47:58,275 --> 00:47:59,469
But, some don't know to cook.

878
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,473
yet they do it for years
like your mother.

879
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:02,667
You don't need to go
through this difficulty.

880
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,246
Enjoy good tasty food in hotel.
Now go to office.

881
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:07,040
I will go father and mother.
- Alright.

882
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:09,714
Swathi, get me a glass
of water please.

883
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:15,586
Did you see how his face has
brightened on getting the job?

884
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:16,884
How can he not get it?

885
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,492
If he doesn't get it, who else will?
He is my son.

886
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,258
Next is Swathi's marriage.

887
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:25,327
Any news from that
Rajamundry proposal.

888
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:27,969
It seems they have talked to
the priest about all this.

889
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:32,073
Elder son is about to get a job...
- Elder son? What's this elder son?

890
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:33,804
We have only one son.

891
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,441
What's that?
What's that carelessness?

892
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,514
I broke just a glass.

893
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,523
What are you doing Ankita?
There's no feel.

894
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,755
Feel! you must dance with feel.
Let's try again.

895
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:10,245
Can't you understand if I tell once?
Do I've to tell you 10 times?

896
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,741
You will not win a cup like this.
You'll get only a tea cup.

897
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,416
Go...and sit there.

898
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,749
Don't think about anything else.
Go and sit there.

899
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:30,864
What's this Prakash? You too.

900
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,330
What's that difference in voice?

901
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:33,963
You chided her loudly
when she made mistake.

902
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:35,798
When I did it, you say
it with respect.

903
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,301
Is it because I am the
Vice Chancellor's son?

904
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:40,032
If you shout on her to
get the feel in public.

905
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:42,234
She'll feel bad but
never get that feel.

906
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,209
First learn to teach.

907
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:46,240
Go.

908
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:49,642
Ankita, you are good.

909
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:51,885
Your dance really good.

910
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,160
lmagine me as your lover.

911
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:30,520
What are you writing so seriously?
- Letter to my father.

912
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:33,259
But you don't know to write, do you?

913
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:35,522
No problem. My father too
doesn't know to read.

914
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,196
My stomach is upset. I will take
you to task after coming out.

915
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:46,472
Boy...one Mr.Sathyam here...

916
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:47,402
Who are you sir?

917
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,272
Is it you sir?
Please come in.

918
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:50,540
Are you fine?

919
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,515
Sit down sir. I will come back
in a minute. - Okay.

920
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:58,388
When will the palanquin
bearer travel in it?

921
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,553
I have work.
What about you?

922
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,858
That means I must go away
without wasting much time.

923
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:08,431
No to advises and help.

924
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:12,228
Did you write all this?
- Yes.

925
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,237
I thought you are maintaining
only a good physique.

926
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:17,296
Your room maintenance
is also good.

927
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:20,704
Did you meet my father?

928
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:21,969
I met him.

929
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:23,437
I think it's better for you
to stay here only.

930
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,171
You father is really great.

931
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,673
Talk to him about
anything on earth.

932
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,853
He ends up with you and
some disgusting remark.

933
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:33,089
Another world is calling you...

934
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:36,350
Are you a fan of Sri Sri?
- Yes.

935
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,458
Have a glass of water.

936
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:39,796
What has brought you here?

937
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:42,965
I forgot. It seems your sister forgot
to give you this on that day.

938
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:44,133
I came to give you this.

939
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:47,800
Why did you take pain
to give me this?

940
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:49,631
I didn't come here just for this.

941
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,137
My manager stays nearby only.

942
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:52,968
I came to talk to him
about my loan.

943
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:56,972
My friend has good taste.

944
00:51:58,181 --> 00:51:59,648
She takes pocket money
from my father

945
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,477
and buys presents for me.

946
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:03,645
If there's any person to give me.

947
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:06,322
It's Swathi. Whether it is
love or presents.

948
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:08,991
Will anything stop for a red cap?

949
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:11,160
Why are you beating
an innocent boy?

950
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:12,988
Innocent? Him?

951
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:15,164
If there's a buyer, he will
sell lndia for Rs.20.

952
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,496
He's Kumar. Our home department.

953
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:20,169
Vll class, all subjects failed.
- Except Maths.

954
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,667
Oh! Did you pass that subject?

955
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:22,668
No, I was absent.

956
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,343
Even if you had present it wouldn't
have changed the result much.

957
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:28,169
I will take leave.

958
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:33,509
What do you do sir?

959
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:35,844
I am a supervisor in a
Coke bottling company

960
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,349
Uncle Lingam, you've come
at the right time.

961
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,181
He is the owner of house.
- ...Owner's husband.

962
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,016
Uncle, he is Mr.Shankar
I told you earlier.

963
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:42,858
Greetings sir.
- Greetings sir.

964
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,356
He told me everything about you.

965
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:49,859
By the way, I am Manager
of Durga lndustries.

966
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:52,030
I don't know how strict
he is in office.

967
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:53,202
He is very strict in house.

968
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:54,700
If his voice is heard in the street.

969
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:55,701
His wife starts shivering.

970
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:57,032
Is it?
- Yes.

971
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:59,034
She has her own fears.

972
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:01,540
Father, mother has gone to a
movie with the lady next door.

973
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:04,373
She asked you to make
egg plant gravy.

974
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,708
She told you to wash
clothes after cooking.

975
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,049
What have you done father?

976
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,049
Zip up your shorts.

977
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:13,222
How can I if you don't
stitch it properly?

978
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:16,558
Children!- Yes children.

979
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,059
Classmates are teasing me
as calling bell and post office.

980
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:26,399
I will talk to them.
- Why are you beating me?

981
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:27,729
I will complain to mother.

982
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:31,403
Is this your world?
- Yes.

983
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,243
Come to my office tomorrow.

984
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:36,575
Why?
- Come, I will tell you there.

985
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:38,580
I will go.
- Okay sir.

986
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:45,580
I've understood why our
country is under developed.

987
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:49,418
You don't know about yourself.
What do you know about country?

988
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:50,760
Look there brother.

989
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:52,685
There's nothing.

990
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,764
Do you need 2 vans to take a rope?

991
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:58,764
Country is backward not for that.

992
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,266
But for intellectuals like you.

993
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,768
That's why I am going
away to Dubai.

994
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,099
Did you see my passport photo?

995
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,775
This is your photo.
You say some passport's photo.

996
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:08,103
Bloody!

997
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:12,444
Excuse me. Will you lift your leg?
I will take photo.

998
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:14,275
I am asking you to lift.

999
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:16,618
I will kill you, bloody rogue.

1000
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:19,615
What happened?
- Nothing.

1001
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:20,786
Why are you saying nothing?

1002
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,789
You keep quiet,
you don't know anything.

1003
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:26,121
He said he will take photo if
the girl lifts her leg.

1004
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:26,795
No.

1005
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:37,462
This rogue has become
a pain in the wrong place.

1006
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:39,301
Are you happy now?

1007
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:40,305
Go away.

1008
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:42,471
Why are you here?
- My bad time.

1009
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:43,304
Is your passport work over?

1010
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:45,140
Just now stamping work
is also over.

1011
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:47,316
You went to Shankar's office.
What happened?

1012
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:48,480
Get into the car.
I will tell you.

1013
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:50,653
Bye sister. Get in mad boy.

1014
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:55,821
Brother, is it for me?

1015
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:58,324
Look, you have got this job
with Shankar's recommendation.

1016
00:54:58,528 --> 00:54:59,495
It is first day. So I came.

1017
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:00,822
From tomorrow you have to
manage it yourself.

1018
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,160
Look, how brilliantly
they are performing.

1019
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:06,665
Where is our college's dance troupe?

1020
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:09,505
Take care. I will come back
in a minute.

1021
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:10,865
I will die.

1022
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:14,508
I know a dancer who'll create
wonders on the stage.

1023
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:15,336
He will tear open.

1024
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:16,512
Did he tear this also?

1025
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:17,509
Is he such a good dancer?

1026
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:19,841
Good dancer? He's famous in my
area to dance for funerals.

1027
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:22,348
I'll kill you, how can he dance on a stage
one who dances for the dead?

1028
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,520
You don't want him.
...Come, let's go.

1029
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:25,517
Is he that good?

1030
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:27,014
Shut up.

1031
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:29,017
Is he that good dancer?
- He will rip you apart.

1032
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,852
There's no dancer like him
in Andhra Pradesh.

1033
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:32,392
Is it? Where is he?

1034
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:34,196
Greetings to elders.

1035
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:35,360
For the young...

1036
00:55:35,799 --> 00:56:21,037
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

1037
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:23,302
If you want to achieve something...

1038
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:29,183
World is ours, damn it.

1039
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:39,754
No words, do it
once and show man.

1040
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:43,656
Take the short cut to success.

1041
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:47,763
If you take bold steps
victory is yours.

1042
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:51,668
The sweat you shed will leave a
trail of happiness later.

TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

1044
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:49,654
If you go deep down
the sea till the end.

1045
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:53,324
You can harvest pearls
and shine like it.

1046
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,162
Succeed against all odds.

1047
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:57,168
Leave behind a jealousy crowd.

1048
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:04,974
A ball touching ground will raise
twice high to touch the sky.

Every man is an elementary.

1051
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,820
A new entry in the game of life.

1052
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:27,426
Give up yourself for
the ray of light of future.

1053
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:31,589
Love...Mosquito...Vasco-da-gama...Sister
brother-in-law, girl next door.

1054
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:35,430
Spend the life.
Live all your life.

1055
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:39,267
Old men will laugh
looking at the past,

1056
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:46,441
...will march ahead
with eye on future.

1057
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:55,856
...Saying there's no one to stop us.

TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

1059
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,787
Why didn't you come?
Do you know how tensed I was?

1060
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:07,126
I thought if I don't come, Ankita's solo
dance will win accolades.

1061
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,294
But...
- Okay, come.

1062
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,625
Take it.

1063
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:16,632
Didn't I say we will win?
We got the cup, didn't we?

1064
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,966
Enough...enough.
- Your dance was great.

1065
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,309
Thank you.

1066
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,970
Won't you dance?
- No, I am a singer.

1067
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,807
So, audience will have an ear problem
only no eye problem.

1068
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,445
Why are you so angry?
He was right.

1070
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:37,450
You are a poem
hidden in my eyes.

1071
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:41,620
When Cauvery flows and clouds thunder.

1072
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:45,282
It's you in my heart.

1073
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:47,462
When clouds melt.

1074
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:53,295
You are the rain drop
reaching the earth.

1075
01:02:53,836 --> 01:03:01,470
You are the first woman to
strike a chord in my heart.

1076
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:09,478
My life is dedicated
to reach you.

1077
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:13,655
Why did you call me here?

1078
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:15,824
To give you small party.
- Why?

1079
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:16,992
Asking why?

1080
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:18,990
He got a job because of you.

1081
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:23,492
Small party for that?
It needs a big party.

1082
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:26,327
Then, pay the bill now.
I will throw a big party later.

1083
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:30,502
Eternal Lovers.

1084
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:34,172
Are they lovers?

1085
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:36,504
Look at their age.

1086
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:40,007
Their age isn't as many days I had
taken leave in my office.

1087
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:42,180
It has become a fashion now.

1088
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:45,186
They will join 10th class,
search for a partner.

1089
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:46,355
They will pass to intermediate.

1090
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:47,523
They will go searching for a bed.

1091
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:48,849
When they enter graduation.

1092
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:51,026
What is there left?
They will part ways.

1093
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:54,530
It's not their fault.
It's their parent's fault.

1094
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:56,361
It's all in the way
you are brought up.

1095
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:58,033
Hi brother!

1096
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,037
How are you?
- Fine.

1097
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:03,363
By the way...

1098
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:08,032
Oh! This is your meeting place, isn't it?
- Yes.

1099
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:10,375
Get 5 ice creams and
a coffee please.

1100
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:11,376
Why 5 ice creams?

1101
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:12,707
You are never satisfied with one.

1102
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:15,043
He loves me very much.

1103
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:16,385
What's the news?

1104
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:18,053
Ashok got a job.

1105
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:19,881
How he got the job...

1106
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:20,714
How did he get it?

1107
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:22,891
He would've answered their
questions, so he got it.

1108
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:24,059
lce creams have come.

1109
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:26,391
What is mother doing?

1110
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:30,225
She always tries to bring up
your topic with father.

1111
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,228
And father will try to
cut it, isn't it?

1112
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:37,235
Do you take anything so slightly?

1113
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:39,404
Yes sir. Coffee too.

1114
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:42,407
Yesterday, I had the
3rd official sighting.

1115
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:43,909
Office sighting?

1116
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:45,580
Bride seeing ceremony.

1117
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:48,576
Bridegroom ogles at the girl
before the entire family.

1118
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:49,751
What's the result this time?

1119
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:51,579
I am okay but dowry is not okay.

1120
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:52,913
Is it kept in abeyance?

1121
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,587
Does your entire family
speak like this?

1122
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,088
Only we too.

1123
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:01,426
Okay brother, I will go.
- So soon?

1124
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:02,598
Can't you stay for some more time?

1125
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:06,935
You feel like staying
with us, don't you?

1126
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:14,269
Sentiments.
- Got it.

1127
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:19,706
I'll also go. -Bye brother.

1128
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:22,951
Eat happily.

1129
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:27,118
It's 3 PM
- Shouldn't it ring 3 PM?

1130
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:29,621
What about the bill?
- I don't want.

1131
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:38,959
Will you ply the Taxi?

1132
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:43,635
I will. Where?

1133
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,306
Ravindra Bharathi.
- Come.

1134
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:52,814
Is it so important to attend
Chakradhari's felicitation function?

1135
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:56,143
When people are felicitating
a man's talent.

1136
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:57,979
What's wrong in
attending that function?

1137
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:00,485
Do you like Chakradhari so much?

1138
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:02,487
I love songs written by him.

1139
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:05,490
Did you listened Sahithi songs?
I listened.

1140
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,994
I was listening to the 'I am in love'
song, my tape got damaged.

1141
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:16,671
Are you also a fan of Chakradhari?
- Yes.

1142
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:17,839
Yes? Finished.

1143
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:25,003
Hiding a million dreams deep down
in the heart, O my friend.

1144
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:33,186
When they are reaching you
As waves my heart is shining.

1145
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:37,189
Oh beauty! You are my
River Godavari in moon light.

1146
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:41,022
I must became a drop of water.

1147
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:45,197
Smiling maiden.
Don't slip away from me.

1148
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:49,030
I want to reach you.

1149
01:06:49,405 --> 01:07:01,215
It's happy to reach you like a gentle
rain reaching tender leaf.

1150
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:03,442
Leaving the white sari,
worn in the morning.

1151
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:08,156
The sky maiden is getting ready
to wear black sari of evening,

1152
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,218
is my bodhi tree (tree of salvation)

1153
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:13,054
It's revealing a truth
every day to me.

1154
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:17,562
We are felicitating a great poet
Chakradhari who wrote poems like this.

1155
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:23,234
Film writer, Bhaskara Bhatla.

1156
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:25,407
His experience is
more than my age.

1157
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:28,736
I am qualified to
speak about him.

1158
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:31,238
He's like a Guru
to many like me.

1159
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:32,414
Singer Ravi Varma.

1160
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:33,582
Greetings to everyone.

1161
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:36,417
I've sung many songs
written by Chakradhari.

1162
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,747
I consider it as my luck to
sing his songs.

1163
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:42,583
Now, music director Chakri.

1164
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:43,918
Greetings to everyone.

1165
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,257
To tell about Mr.Chakradhari...

1166
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:49,920
Truly, he's a lyrist for whom
Telugu cinema can feel proud of.

1167
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:51,425
He's a boon.

1168
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:52,597
Though he is an elderly man.

1169
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:55,270
There is a feel of youth
in his songs.

1170
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:57,939
To tell you more about him...

1171
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:04,776
Now Chakradhari
will address you.

1172
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:07,616
Greetings to all.

1173
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:11,119
Though songs come out of pen.

1174
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:13,789
It's really born in dreams.

1175
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:17,793
Can we start the
free discussion now?

1176
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,287
Which is your first song?

1177
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:27,465
I drew a sketch in my heart.

1178
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:33,809
That's all.

1179
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:37,137
Your favourite song?

1180
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:43,812
Favourite song, I have many.
It is difficult to select one.

1181
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:46,317
It will be very good to
sell other's songs.

1182
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:54,656
I've become a statute.

1183
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:57,662
Couldn't he sing any better song?

1184
01:08:57,867 --> 01:08:58,333
He did sing, that is enough.

1185
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:02,493
Sing a song from the film
releasing next week.

1186
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:05,336
I am not a singer.

1187
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:06,838
But, you sang just a while ago.

1188
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,518
Next week the audio
will be released.

1189
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:27,856
A great poet who doesn't know his
songs till audio is released.

1190
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:30,691
I will sing...sing.

1191
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:40,871
Pleasant...pleasant...pleasant.

1192
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:46,545
Dreams are pleasant to eyes.

1193
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:48,375
For the flowing river...

1194
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:54,385
What happened to him suddenly?

1195
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,727
That's the matter.

1196
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:00,054
He will no more get words.

1197
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:03,224
Waves of a flowing river...

1198
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:06,060
Why is he struggling
to sing a song?

1199
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,401
You become the blue clouds.

1200
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:14,732
If your smile rains like honey
for me, it'll be pleasant.

1201
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:23,080
It will be pleasant
if it drenches me.

1202
01:10:26,088 --> 01:11:04,123
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

1203
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:06,461
Pleasant...pleasant.

1204
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:08,956
Dreams are pleasant to eyes.

1205
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:11,629
Waves are pleasant
to flowing rivers.

1206
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,465
You are the clouds in the blue sky.

1207
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:21,132
If your smiles fall as rain of honey
for me, it'll be pleasant.

1208
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:26,978
It'll be pleasant
if it drenches me.

1210
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:24,932
Any haiku I write for you
is pleasant.

1211
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:29,934
Even a little word you speak
for me is pleasant.

1212
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:45,052
Your speechless silent expression
of eyes is also pleasant.

1213
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:50,558
Roar of sea that is charming
my heart is also pleasant.

1214
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:55,159
Honey in pleasant
Your smile is pleasant.

1215
01:12:55,604 --> 01:13:01,304
If you are there, even the
void will be pleasant.

1217
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:05,297
Fragrance in my lover's
breathe is also pleasant.

1218
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:10,003
The sand on which my lover
walks is also pleasant.

1219
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:25,418
The red streak in sun rise
is also pleasant.

1220
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:30,260
The cool moonlight dousing the
night is also pleasant.

1221
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:35,401
Pink cheeks and black kohl
of my lover is also pleasant.

1222
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:41,203
Even the tears dropping down
her eyes is also pleasant.

1223
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:13,337
Sexy...sexy...people call me sexy.

1224
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:14,839
Hi sexy...hello sexy.

1225
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:15,839
Why do they all me like that?

1226
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:19,677
Sathyam, hasn't bought any new clothes.
All of them are old.

1227
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:20,906
Let me wear one of these.

1228
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:25,178
I understand, love is mad.

1229
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:26,854
Will anyone greet
a flower with a flower?

1230
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:29,190
My love is a tree growing.

1231
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:31,518
This world is hanging
holding its roots.

1232
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:35,458
I want to see your beauty,
at least in my dreams.

1233
01:15:36,565 --> 01:15:39,591
I'll hold your soft hand and
travel around the universe.

1234
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:47,869
Uncle Lingam.

1235
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:55,375
Her name is...
- Ankita. Sit down.

1236
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:57,882
She is doing M.B.B.S.

1237
01:15:58,086 --> 01:16:00,384
Then she must be knowing about heart.

1238
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:02,614
It's not about the heart
she must know.

1239
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:06,060
She must know about Sathyam's
love for her in his heart.

1240
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:07,888
He must express his love
for her to know.

1241
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:09,563
He should have expressed
his love by now.

1242
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:11,562
He wouldn't have got an
opportunity to tell her.

1243
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:15,396
Let's create that opportunity.
- Shut up. Stupid ideas.

1244
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:18,899
Let's create that opportunity.

1245
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:21,234
She must agree for us to create it.

1246
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:23,570
One of us must talk and
make her agree.

1247
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:25,409
Who will talk to her?
- You.

1248
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:28,275
You...
- You... - You?

1249
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:31,510
I'm the house owner. How can I?
- You... - You.

1250
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:35,082
Okay, we must talk to her.

1251
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,923
We must make her sit infront
of him and surprise him.

1252
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:42,926
Are you trying to be emotional?
- No, it's a decision.

1253
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:47,935
Go.

1254
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:54,108
You pig, it's Nandhi (Bull).
Go and talk to her.

1255
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:55,776
You people can go.
- Go.

1256
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:57,111
You reduced me to a small boy.

1257
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:01,779
Shit. I missed her.

1258
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:04,111
Hey you... - Come.
- Did you tell her?

1259
01:17:04,486 --> 01:17:05,953
Yes, I told her.
- What did you tell her?

1260
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:07,951
Whatever you said...
I couldn't tell her.

1261
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:09,453
I'll kill you.

1262
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:12,957
We can go to a movie,
if our prayers get over soon.

1263
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:13,957
Pray to god first.

1264
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:15,129
Here.
- Yes.

1265
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:17,795
O goddess. Please protect us,
- It's Lord Hanuman and not a goddess.

1266
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:20,896
Okay. - What okay?
Does your mother has a tail?

1267
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:23,566
What uncle?...
- Did you tell her?

1268
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:28,306
Actually, I'm the eldest and
a manager in my office.

1269
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:31,479
It won't be nice to talk about
such things to her in a temple.

1270
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:35,138
So, you got this idea
only now not at home.

1271
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,312
What's it?

1272
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:45,386
The matter is...

1273
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:49,656
Tell me.

1274
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:51,833
Wear your slippers first.
- He is also right.

1275
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:55,397
Now, tell me.

1276
01:17:57,205 --> 01:18:00,003
Our friend is trying to tell
this for the past 6 months.

1277
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:03,006
It's wrong. It's wrong to love a beautiful
and an educated girl like you.

1278
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:04,838
It's wrong to fall in love with her.

1279
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:07,675
We tried to advise him.
But he never listened to us.

1280
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:10,010
He is sunk in love.
He won't listen to us.

1281
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:13,619
We don't want him to waste his time
and life in the name of love.

1282
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:17,025
Then, go and explain all this to him.
Why're you telling me all this?

1283
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:19,022
So that, you'll tell him.

1284
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:20,854
Why should l?

1285
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:23,361
He'll listen to no one except you.

1286
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:25,859
He is after you for the past 6 months.

1287
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:27,365
Can't you spare 5 minutes for him?

1288
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:29,366
Hello, I've no problem with him.

1289
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:32,039
Yes, you don't.
My friend is very good man.

1290
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:33,708
At least you tell her.

1291
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:37,537
Okay, it's just a matter of 5 minutes.
- You shut up.

1292
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:42,115
You aren't listening to your friend.
How will he listen to us?

1293
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:46,379
Look doctor, some patients
go to the doctor.

1294
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:48,215
Some doctors go to the patient.

1295
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:50,721
Treat our friend as
a patient and come.

1296
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:53,724
You must meet our friend and
cure his love disease.

1297
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:54,896
Don't irritate me.

1298
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:57,224
Wow! Tell this to our friend.

1299
01:18:57,599 --> 01:18:59,464
lmpossible.
- At least tell this.

1300
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:01,565
Shit.
- Who're they?

1301
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:04,902
This is not okay.

1302
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:09,741
What shall we do now?
- Nothing, change location.

1303
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:18,582
Excuse me, pass that money to me.

1304
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:20,254
Four tickets to the place you
are getting down.

1305
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:22,821
5 minutes...please.

1306
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:25,422
Please talk to my brother.

1307
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:28,755
Did you get scared?

1308
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:30,431
Won't I get scared if I see
a devil all of a sudden?

1309
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:32,691
Funny, did I get scared of you?

1310
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:35,030
She might have felt bad.

1311
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:38,204
Where is your friend?
- What for?

1312
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:39,499
Leaving a beautiful girl like you,

1313
01:19:39,641 --> 01:19:42,439
he is in love with some other girl.
I want to teach him a lesson.

1314
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:43,941
She's over there.

1315
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:46,443
She will fall into my trap.

1316
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:06,129
How many times I have to tell you?
Won't you understand?

1317
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:08,135
Stop following me.

1318
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:11,965
Tell him this.
We won't disturb you there after.

1319
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:13,868
It's about his life.

1320
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:15,540
Just 5 minutes.

1321
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:21,543
Will she come?
- She promised.

1322
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:22,646
If she doesn't come.

1323
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:24,876
Shut up, useless.
Very inauspicious.

1324
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:27,747
Will she say 'l love you'?
- Our boy will.

1325
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:30,821
What about that girl?
- She will say the same to you?

1326
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:31,549
If she doesn't?

1327
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:33,995
I'll kill you.

1328
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:35,823
We must think both sides.

1329
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:38,499
Think...you think from that side.

1330
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:41,669
Think from there,
no need to come here.

1331
01:20:43,705 --> 01:20:45,172
I'll order later.
Let my friends come.

1332
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:46,340
Get me a coffee.

1333
01:20:49,211 --> 01:20:51,236
He is the boy we
were talking about.

1334
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:56,245
You have come so far.
Why do you hesitate? Go and tell him.

1335
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,347
Where are you going?
- To accompany my friend.

1336
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:01,921
They'll be discussing about
their personal matters.

1337
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:09,185
Can I sit here?
- Sure.

1338
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:15,198
You also sit.

1339
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:26,036
I want to talk to you?
- Go ahead.

1340
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,809
I had seen you before.

1341
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:35,215
You travelled in my taxi once.

1342
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:37,550
Yes, you are Chakradhari's fan.

1343
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:39,886
You said you wanted
to say something.

1344
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:47,568
It's been very long. They would've
expressed their love.

1345
01:21:47,769 --> 01:21:49,396
We must start printing
wedding invitations.

1346
01:21:54,442 --> 01:22:05,410
Look, life is sentiment,
ambition, career, affection and love.

1347
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:13,355
Life isn't just love,
am I right?

1348
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:19,589
Love means.
- Why're you telling all this to me?

1349
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:23,668
Because you are in love.

1350
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:25,097
With whom?

1351
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:29,602
Your friends told me.

1352
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:32,446
Then, go and ask them.

1353
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:35,115
What you're saying is...
- The truth.

1354
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:36,006
Then?

1355
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,687
That's all.
- Okay, bye.

1356
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:46,126
What happened?

1357
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:48,956
He doesn't have any such intention.
You wasted my time.

1358
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:53,123
First try to understand your friend.
You people need treatment first.

1359
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:54,635
Let's go.

1360
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:56,629
Playing fool with me, rascals.

1361
01:22:56,838 --> 01:22:57,463
What's this?

1362
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:35,869
We're feeling bad for you and
you are scribbling something.

1363
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:38,071
I have work, you?

1364
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:39,042
Since we have no other work.

1365
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:41,545
We were after her like dogs, and
struggled hard to bring her here.

1366
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,377
You love Ankita very much,

1367
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:44,984
then, why didn't you talk to
her when she came to you.

1368
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:48,215
If I knew she was coming there,
I wouldn't have gone there.

1369
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:49,890
Why did you call her there
without my knowledge?

1370
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:52,059
We are mad.

1371
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:55,058
Do you know how much we
struggled to bring her there?

1372
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:58,065
That's your mistake.
Did I ask you the trouble?

1373
01:23:58,266 --> 01:23:59,563
Yes, it was our mistake.

1374
01:23:59,768 --> 01:24:01,565
It's our mistake because we wanted
to see you both together.

1375
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:04,000
We won't talk anything to Ankita
hereafter. Is it enough?

1376
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:09,743
Uncle Lingam.
- Don't touch me.

1377
01:24:14,282 --> 01:24:15,044
Won't you talk to me?

1378
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:21,084
If you're showing so much interest
in me and on my love.

1379
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:22,085
How much interested should I be?

1380
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:27,094
Do you know what had happened before
the meeting you had arranged?

1381
01:24:27,629 --> 01:24:28,095
Do you know that?

1382
01:24:30,298 --> 01:24:33,267
Only now you had the time
to come my house. Come.

1383
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:35,163
You never used to talk
to me like this earlier.

1384
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:36,095
Sorrows.

1385
01:24:36,638 --> 01:24:39,766
There is no other choice. This is the
only choice to forget our sorrows.

1386
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:42,602
Do people in sorrows
drink liquor like you?

1387
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:44,774
I don't bother about
other's sorrows.

1388
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:48,107
But I need to know your sorrows.
Tell me your sorrows.

1389
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:50,113
I need Rs.2 lakhs urgently
- What for?

1390
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:51,615
To pay my daughter's college fees.

1391
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:52,787
You told that you have a daughter.

1392
01:24:52,987 --> 01:24:54,784
But you never told me that you
have a grown up daughter.

1393
01:24:54,989 --> 01:24:55,956
I've told you now,

1394
01:24:56,491 --> 01:24:59,289
my daughter is everything to me.

1395
01:24:59,828 --> 01:25:03,059
I don't know whether I had filled
the place of a mother in her life,

1396
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:05,799
But to me, she is a mother.

1397
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:09,136
She has only one wish,
to become a doctor.

1398
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:14,297
She scored 96% in lntermediate exams.
But she didn't get a seat on merit.

1399
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:16,067
I approached many people.

1400
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:19,643
They promised, but no one
promised a seat to her.

1401
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:20,815
But I never lost hope.

1402
01:25:22,183 --> 01:25:23,411
In these 4 years,

1403
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:28,482
not only in my office, I begged
and borrowed money from everyone.

1404
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:31,818
I had paid Rs.13 lakhs for her.

1405
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:36,319
But, I've to pay the final
fees of Rs.2 lakhs

1406
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:38,025
If I don't pay that money,

1407
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:41,995
her studies will get stopped,
my little girl will feel bad.

1408
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:46,834
If she smiles, I can keep looking
at her smile forever.

1409
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:53,105
But I can't see her crying.

1410
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:56,843
So, unable to bear the pain.
- You drink.

1411
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:57,847
Shouldn't l?

1412
01:25:58,052 --> 01:26:00,350
If you'll get Rs.2 lakhs by boozing,
I'll also join you.

1413
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:01,579
You'll get Rs.4 lakhs.

1414
01:26:02,056 --> 01:26:04,524
If you drink, instead of
arranging the money,

1415
01:26:04,726 --> 01:26:06,853
you'll become a patient before
your daughter becomes a doctor.

1416
01:26:07,061 --> 01:26:10,258
It's alright.
My daughter will treat me.

1417
01:26:10,732 --> 01:26:11,926
I'll bring water.

1418
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:22,603
Your wife is very beautiful.

1419
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:28,045
That's why, I married her.
Tell me, am I not handsome?

1420
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,615
You crack jokes when you are drunk.

1421
01:26:42,263 --> 01:26:45,289
My daughter. She is very beautiful,
isn't she?

1422
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,227
She is like her mother.
Look here.

1423
01:26:47,435 --> 01:26:51,303
This photograph was taken
when she was angry on me.

1424
01:26:51,773 --> 01:26:57,302
Look at the affection in her
face even when she is angry.

1425
01:26:59,447 --> 01:27:00,846
How long will you keep
looking at her?

1426
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:01,911
This is the first time.

1427
01:27:02,116 --> 01:27:03,242
You've come to my house. Come and take
a look around my house.

1428
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:05,745
Come...

1429
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,985
I've only 2 desires.

1430
01:27:08,456 --> 01:27:12,256
One, to make my daughter, a doctor.

1431
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:17,864
Two, to get her married to
a rich and famous groom.

1432
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:19,095
What do you say?

1433
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:30,009
Your daughter must get a husband
who is rich and famous.

1434
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:33,447
After I came to know that
Ankita is Shankar's daughter.

1435
01:27:34,148 --> 01:27:35,945
I decided not to reveal my love.

1436
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:38,448
Will you not tell her about
your love forever?

1437
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:40,010
I will tell.

1438
01:27:40,989 --> 01:27:43,958
As he wished, I'll tell her after
becoming rich and famous.

1439
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:47,124
Till now, I wanted to be
a writer someday.

1440
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:49,956
Now, I'll become
a writer immediately.

1441
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:51,028
lmmediately, means.

1442
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,797
You come with a file early morning.
Go...go...

1443
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:57,301
I don't know what I might do
if I get angry. - What'll you do?

1444
01:27:57,505 --> 01:27:59,132
I said I don't know.
- Keep quiet.

1445
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:02,309
Allow me to meet Chakri once...
- Didn't you get me? Go away.

1446
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:05,376
Why're you pushing me?

1447
01:28:08,516 --> 01:28:09,983
How can you push him
as if he's a labourer.

1448
01:28:10,184 --> 01:28:12,914
Do you know, who he is? A great poet.
Moreover, I know him.

1449
01:28:13,187 --> 01:28:13,653
Go.

1450
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:18,818
Snake has value as long as it
is around Lord Shiva's neck.

1451
01:28:19,027 --> 01:28:20,995
Then, it can crack jokes
on the eagle too.

1452
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:25,825
If it leaves Lord Shiva's neck and comes
down, even a crow will peck on it.

1453
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:29,396
You're a poet. I don't have
to explain you more.

1454
01:28:30,371 --> 01:28:33,499
So you're trying.
You'll come up in life.

1455
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:39,310
May I come in?
- You? Why are you late?

1456
01:28:39,547 --> 01:28:40,673
I had a dream, last night.

1457
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:41,348
In my dream,

1458
01:28:41,549 --> 01:28:45,178
I was returning from a jolly trip to
Japan, Singapore, Germany, Malaysia.

1459
01:28:45,386 --> 01:28:48,355
The landing got delayed in
Hyderabad airport today morning.

1460
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:50,023
If you keep dreaming like this,

1461
01:28:50,224 --> 01:28:52,954
you won't be able to travel
even by a city bus. Go.

1462
01:28:53,561 --> 01:28:56,530
What about you?
- I went to the airport to receive him.

1463
01:29:01,869 --> 01:29:08,707
But men suffer more from heart diseases
than women now, know why?

1464
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:10,207
Prakash, tell me why?

1465
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:15,106
I've lost my heart.
How would I know?

1466
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:18,783
My heart isn't with me.

1467
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:28,119
I'll pay the bill,
order something.

1468
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:36,403
Your father had paid
Rs.13 lakhs in 4 years.

1469
01:29:36,604 --> 01:29:38,003
Can't he arrange Rs.2 lakhs?

1470
01:29:38,773 --> 01:29:41,799
I know how hard he had
struggled to pay the fees.

1471
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:42,906
That's why, I'm worried.

1472
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:45,739
Ankita, leave your worries and
concentrate on your studies.

1473
01:29:45,947 --> 01:29:47,744
The worries are for studies only.

1474
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:50,679
Ankita, I feel this paper
will be useful to you.

1475
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:55,145
Wow! Look at this Ad.

1476
01:29:55,623 --> 01:29:57,420
This is an Ad from a hospital.

1477
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:59,092
For students who have
scored more than 95%

1478
01:29:59,293 --> 01:30:00,590
They're ready to pay the fees,
and after the completion of studies,

1479
01:30:00,795 --> 01:30:02,490
they're offering a job in
their hospital, take a look.

1480
01:30:04,298 --> 01:30:05,265
This is an old paper.

1481
01:30:05,466 --> 01:30:07,093
Paper might be old,
but the ad is new.

1482
01:30:07,301 --> 01:30:09,360
Interview closes at 5 P.M.
today evening. Come let's go.

1483
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:13,099
Boy, go fast.
- We are very near to the hospital.

1484
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:15,169
Be patient for some more time.

1485
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:17,444
Look.

1486
01:30:23,317 --> 01:30:25,444
He is driving rashly.
- Are you hurt?

1487
01:30:28,322 --> 01:30:29,050
Hey stop!

1488
01:30:31,993 --> 01:30:32,789
The interview is over.

1489
01:30:32,994 --> 01:30:34,291
We have already selected 10 people.
- Actually...

1490
01:30:37,665 --> 01:30:39,633
100's of people would've
attended the interview.

1491
01:30:39,834 --> 01:30:42,803
Even if we had come in time, how can
you say that we would've got the job?

1492
01:30:43,004 --> 01:30:46,963
Shit! It's all because of
that stupid taxi driver.

1493
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:48,467
This was a very good chance.

1494
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:50,310
He'll never come up in life.

1495
01:30:50,511 --> 01:30:53,309
Since I've brought her in time,
mother and the child are safe, aren't they?

1496
01:30:53,514 --> 01:30:56,972
How did you know that?
- From your face. Bye.

1497
01:31:00,354 --> 01:31:01,582
May you and your family
live happily.

1498
01:31:04,325 --> 01:31:07,294
Why're you standing?
Please sit. - It's alright.

1499
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:09,630
Since your son has got
only an increment.

1500
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:11,389
We are accepting this humble party.

1501
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:14,294
He's so talented that
he'll soon get promotion.

1502
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:15,969
Then, you must give us a big party.

1503
01:31:16,337 --> 01:31:17,065
What do you say?
- Definitely.

1504
01:31:17,338 --> 01:31:18,965
I'll arrange a party at your choice.

1505
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:22,142
Father, the wedding invitation
has come. Check the proof.

1506
01:31:22,343 --> 01:31:25,210
Is it Ashok's marriage?
- No, it's for my daughter, Swathi.

1507
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:28,148
The groom is working in America.
- America?

1508
01:31:28,516 --> 01:31:30,814
Then, the dowry must be handsome.
- They said they don't want anything.

1509
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:32,417
Then, you're very lucky.

1510
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:36,088
Why did you add Sathyam's
name in this?

1511
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:37,991
I wanted to add Sathyam's name in it.

1512
01:31:38,192 --> 01:31:39,557
Is Sathyam your younger son?

1513
01:31:40,695 --> 01:31:42,162
I feel proud to be his father.

1514
01:31:42,363 --> 01:31:44,092
I feel shame to be
Sathyam's father.

1515
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:47,823
If a child is congenital handicap.
We'll feel pity on him.

1516
01:31:48,035 --> 01:31:49,434
But what can we do if
he is a bad character?

1517
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:50,671
We think that it's our fate.

1518
01:31:51,372 --> 01:31:52,168
Is it so important?

1519
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:54,341
Why aren't you afraid
of your father?

1520
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:56,476
I must have respect for him
and not be afraid of him.

1521
01:31:56,711 --> 01:31:59,236
What is Sathyam doing?
- I have forgotten that I had such a son.

1522
01:31:59,714 --> 01:32:01,841
Ashok is my only son.
He is gold.

1523
01:32:02,049 --> 01:32:04,677
If he is gold, you are a diamond.
Kohinoor diamond.

1524
01:32:05,052 --> 01:32:07,179
For the first time in my life,
I felt bad for being a peon.

1525
01:32:07,388 --> 01:32:08,514
I couldn't tell the truth.

1526
01:32:08,723 --> 01:32:11,191
Or else, I would have given
a run for their money.

1527
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:13,519
Uncle, you are talking too much
and it is about my father.

1528
01:32:13,728 --> 01:32:16,026
I know. You respect your father
very much, but he is...

1529
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:17,697
Peon Lingam.

1530
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:23,359
Oh my uncle...
Uncle Lingam, so you are here.

1531
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:26,468
Go. Aunt is waiting to
have lunch with you.

1532
01:32:26,741 --> 01:32:29,710
For me? But why?
- Because you must go and look.

1533
01:32:30,578 --> 01:32:32,478
Come. Don't feel shy.

1534
01:32:32,747 --> 01:32:35,147
All are my friends.
All of them are here.

1535
01:32:35,917 --> 01:32:37,885
Each one is a different character.
- Who is he?

1536
01:32:38,753 --> 01:32:39,378
Photographer.

1537
01:32:39,587 --> 01:32:41,885
I thought he is a stenographer.
Why is he here?

1538
01:32:42,089 --> 01:32:44,557
He wanted male models.

1539
01:32:44,759 --> 01:32:46,556
I have brought him here
to select from you.

1540
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:49,286
If we get money, we can booze.
Take a good look.

1541
01:32:49,597 --> 01:32:51,224
You can also select him.

1542
01:32:57,438 --> 01:32:59,497
He is okay sir. - One minute.
I will be back soon.

1543
01:33:00,775 --> 01:33:03,573
Infact, the other day I was invited
to model for fair and lovely.

1544
01:33:03,778 --> 01:33:05,405
If the listener is an idiot.

1545
01:33:05,613 --> 01:33:07,581
He'll tell that an elephant
had piloted an airplane.

1546
01:33:07,782 --> 01:33:09,579
People who don't use fair and lovely
will become like this.

1547
01:33:09,784 --> 01:33:13,185
I didn't like the caption. So, I refused.
Because you are forcing me to do it.

1548
01:33:19,126 --> 01:33:20,525
If there is a film shoot,
inform me earlier.

1549
01:33:20,962 --> 01:33:23,260
A big shot has booked me
for Coke ad.

1550
01:33:23,464 --> 01:33:25,261
All girls are from foreign.
Will you come?

1551
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:26,592
I must meet Keeravani tomorrow.

1552
01:33:26,801 --> 01:33:30,202
You are missing a golden chance.
We must've been born as a foreigner.

1553
01:33:30,471 --> 01:33:32,098
We can go anywhere.
We can flirt with anyone.

1554
01:33:32,306 --> 01:33:33,432
We can do anything
with anyone we like.

1555
01:33:33,641 --> 01:33:35,006
Then, take birth as a dog.

1556
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:38,938
When will you tell Shankar
about your love?

1557
01:33:39,146 --> 01:33:40,272
Let me get a chance as a writer.

1558
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:44,008
Before you get a chance, he'll get
his daughter married to someone.

1559
01:33:44,318 --> 01:33:46,286
A good idea!
What if we produce a film?

1560
01:33:46,487 --> 01:33:49,115
Anyway I'll become a model, so I'll be
the hero. You're the solo writer.

1561
01:33:49,323 --> 01:33:52,292
You'll get Ankita. I'll settle with
Aishwarya Rai or Amisha Patel.

1562
01:33:52,493 --> 01:33:53,118
They must be lucky.

1563
01:33:53,327 --> 01:33:55,295
Don't you think you are
talking little too much.

1564
01:33:55,496 --> 01:33:56,622
Don't feel bad.
You are the production manager.

1565
01:33:56,831 --> 01:33:57,627
Who is the producer?

1566
01:33:57,832 --> 01:33:58,958
We are going to make the film
by selling his wife's house.

1567
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:00,963
Shut up. Stop your stupid talk.

1568
01:34:01,168 --> 01:34:03,796
From cigarettes to pasting wall poster,
you want my house for everything.

1569
01:34:04,005 --> 01:34:04,972
Which is your house?

1570
01:34:05,172 --> 01:34:06,901
Thinking that you are a manager,
aunt brought this house as dowry.

1571
01:34:07,341 --> 01:34:09,969
He must become writer soon, only then
he can tell about his love to Shankar.

1572
01:34:10,177 --> 01:34:11,474
Shankar will inform Ankita.

1573
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,306
After that...
- Our marriage.

1574
01:34:15,182 --> 01:34:17,582
This is her. This is me...
and...our marriage.

1575
01:34:18,853 --> 01:34:20,480
You don't have to trouble yourself.

1576
01:34:22,189 --> 01:34:23,247
It's enough if you attend my marriage.

1577
01:34:41,709 --> 01:34:43,336
Buddy, are you lost in dreams?

1578
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:45,837
Look, he is feeling shy.

1579
01:34:46,047 --> 01:34:48,948
You don't worry. You'll get
married with Ankita only.

1580
01:34:49,717 --> 01:34:51,548
Where ever you may go,
she'll follow you.

1581
01:35:00,895 --> 01:35:02,362
You wouldn't have got money on time,

1582
01:35:02,563 --> 01:35:05,031
or for some other reason,
you wouldn't have paid the fees.

1583
01:35:05,232 --> 01:35:06,631
The last date is also over.

1584
01:35:06,901 --> 01:35:11,304
I don't want good students like you
to waste an year for this reason.

1585
01:35:11,572 --> 01:35:13,870
However I'll give you
a week's time.

1586
01:35:14,075 --> 01:35:16,441
Only after you pay the fees,
you'll get your certificates.

1587
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:17,536
You can go now.

1588
01:35:18,245 --> 01:35:20,304
Come...

1589
01:35:30,925 --> 01:35:32,722
Why are you looking so dull?
- Nothing like that.

1590
01:35:32,927 --> 01:35:35,725
I can read faces, especially yours.
- That's personal.

1591
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:38,455
Even I want to tell you something
personal. You know what it is.

1592
01:35:39,266 --> 01:35:40,392
But it is my duty to tell you.

1593
01:35:40,601 --> 01:35:41,727
l...

1594
01:35:41,936 --> 01:35:43,733
You want to say you love me.
That's all, isn't it?

1595
01:35:43,938 --> 01:35:46,338
No. I want to marry you.

1596
01:35:47,108 --> 01:35:51,010
You don't have to come out
with me falling in love.

1597
01:35:54,949 --> 01:35:56,416
Let's marry after our
ambitions are fulfilled.

1598
01:35:56,617 --> 01:36:00,075
When my parents approach your father
and if he inquires about me.

1599
01:36:00,287 --> 01:36:01,754
Tell him what you know about me.

1600
01:36:01,956 --> 01:36:03,924
It won't look nice if your father
says 'no' to my parents.

1601
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:10,089
Look, I am not forcing you.
I want my wife to be like you.

1602
01:36:10,297 --> 01:36:12,162
If you feel the same way, okay.

1603
01:36:12,633 --> 01:36:14,430
Let your decision be anything.
But there is only a week's time.

1604
01:36:15,136 --> 01:36:16,160
Don't think it's only one week.

1605
01:36:27,982 --> 01:36:29,108
Ankita, what have you decided?

1606
01:36:29,316 --> 01:36:30,783
There is still time.
Let me think.

1607
01:36:30,985 --> 01:36:32,282
What's there to think about?

1608
01:36:32,486 --> 01:36:35,944
He's handsome, good and intelligent.
He is rich and wealthy.

1609
01:36:36,157 --> 01:36:39,615
You must think to reject
and not to accept him.

1610
01:36:39,827 --> 01:36:41,727
He wanted your permission
to marry you.

1611
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:46,189
Listen to me.

1612
01:36:48,335 --> 01:36:52,135
In lndia, 80% of the women
marry first, love next.

1613
01:36:52,673 --> 01:36:54,538
To me, you both are Wills...

1614
01:36:55,342 --> 01:36:56,809
I mean 'Made for each other'.

1615
01:36:57,011 --> 01:36:59,138
Okay. Stop this topic now.

1616
01:36:59,346 --> 01:37:02,315
Okay. Will you come for combine studies?
- No, I can't.

1617
01:37:02,516 --> 01:37:04,814
Hey, please...please...I'll drop
you at home, if its late.

1618
01:37:05,352 --> 01:37:07,217
Won't you help this poor student?

1619
01:37:10,691 --> 01:37:11,988
It has been very long
since we saw her.

1620
01:37:12,193 --> 01:37:13,820
Why didn't you come to my marriage?

1621
01:37:16,197 --> 01:37:18,324
We have organized a reception here.
It's enough if you come to it.

1622
01:37:24,872 --> 01:37:26,669
So, she has told you
everything about us.

1623
01:37:26,874 --> 01:37:28,341
She talks about you only.

1624
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:30,840
From your college matters to her
marriage getting stopped.

1625
01:37:31,045 --> 01:37:31,841
She has told everything.

1626
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:34,506
Let's have coffee.

1627
01:37:34,715 --> 01:37:36,580
Why here? We'll have it
in your house.

1628
01:37:37,384 --> 01:37:39,249
Anyway, we'll come to know your
house to invite you.

1629
01:37:40,054 --> 01:37:42,784
It's time. She'll turn over a shop
to buy a kerchief.

1630
01:37:43,057 --> 01:37:44,183
Bye...

1631
01:37:46,393 --> 01:37:47,860
Your friends are beautiful than you.

1632
01:37:50,397 --> 01:37:53,025
Sirisha is very happy after
marriage, isn't she?

1633
01:37:53,567 --> 01:37:55,797
If she had married
the one she loved,

1634
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:57,697
She wouldn't have been
so happy today.

1635
01:37:57,905 --> 01:37:59,372
You mean to say that
it's wrong to fall in love.

1636
01:38:00,407 --> 01:38:04,207
We must know him fully
before we fall in love.

1637
01:38:04,411 --> 01:38:06,879
Since I know everything.
I didn't attend the college function.

1638
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:08,548
Since you didn't come,
you missed the cup.

1639
01:38:08,749 --> 01:38:10,376
I don't mind missing the cup.
But the college got it.

1640
01:38:10,584 --> 01:38:13,052
Only because I missed the cup,
she fell into my trap.

1641
01:38:13,254 --> 01:38:15,279
Are you really going to marry her?

1642
01:38:17,258 --> 01:38:18,555
My father will kill me.

1643
01:38:18,759 --> 01:38:22,627
We must behave in a certain way
with certain people.

1644
01:38:22,930 --> 01:38:24,898
She is one of a kind.

1645
01:38:25,933 --> 01:38:29,562
Love and flowers will not
work out with her.

1646
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:31,397
So, I said I'll marry her.

1647
01:38:31,605 --> 01:38:32,902
Will she agree if you say like that?

1648
01:38:33,107 --> 01:38:34,074
Definitely.

1649
01:38:34,775 --> 01:38:38,074
That's why you acted like a
gentleman and toiled so hard.

1650
01:38:38,279 --> 01:38:40,907
Did I just act?
Am I not a gentleman?

1651
01:38:41,448 --> 01:38:45,248
Am I not a good man?
- Who said so?

1652
01:38:45,452 --> 01:38:47,579
You buy us drinks everyday.
You give us money when we need.

1653
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:48,846
You are a gentleman.

1654
01:38:49,123 --> 01:38:51,648
Sorry sir, I was late.

1655
01:38:53,794 --> 01:38:54,920
Why are you so dull?

1656
01:38:55,796 --> 01:38:58,765
Don't talk to me?
You are in no way related to me.

1657
01:39:00,134 --> 01:39:03,103
How did I treat you?
Like a friend.

1658
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:04,664
But you...

1659
01:39:05,139 --> 01:39:06,606
Please listen to me.
- What will you tell me?

1660
01:39:06,807 --> 01:39:07,865
After everyone had told me.

1661
01:39:08,142 --> 01:39:10,269
Actually, I thought of
telling you that.

1662
01:39:10,477 --> 01:39:13,002
You thought! Very good. Go ahead.

1663
01:39:13,814 --> 01:39:18,342
Did you ever tell me that
you write songs?

1664
01:39:19,486 --> 01:39:20,953
Oh! Were you talking about this?

1665
01:39:21,155 --> 01:39:23,214
This? Do you've something else too?

1666
01:39:23,991 --> 01:39:25,288
Yes, there is.
- Tell me what it is?

1667
01:39:25,492 --> 01:39:28,950
I'll tell you later.
- When? After some Lingam tells me.

1668
01:39:30,331 --> 01:39:33,630
I'll tell you myself and to
you personally. Come.

1669
01:39:33,834 --> 01:39:35,324
I will come only if
you tell me first.

1670
01:39:35,502 --> 01:39:38,130
Which round?
- 3rd.
- No, sixth.

1671
01:39:38,505 --> 01:39:39,972
That's the thing, you come.

1672
01:39:40,808 --> 01:39:42,400
Wait, I will pay.

1673
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:46,609
Don't cut my way fool,
I'm feeling giddy.

1674
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:49,612
Another peg would've been good.

1675
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:51,281
You can have it next week.

1676
01:39:51,552 --> 01:39:54,020
Why are you talking to me as
if I am a drunkard?

1677
01:39:54,221 --> 01:39:56,189
I drink once in a week,

1678
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:58,187
That too with my daughter's permission.

1679
01:39:59,393 --> 01:40:00,360
You've already told me.

1680
01:40:00,561 --> 01:40:02,358
You said you will tell
me something.

1681
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:04,858
Who is that?

1682
01:40:07,234 --> 01:40:10,032
Are you driving drunk?
Look how my car is damaged, get down.

1683
01:40:10,237 --> 01:40:11,363
Pay for the damage.

1684
01:40:12,906 --> 01:40:15,374
Look, how the car is damaged,
don't you have eyes to see?

1685
01:40:15,576 --> 01:40:17,703
Hey old man! Why are you
talking too much?

1686
01:40:17,911 --> 01:40:19,708
It's better if you talk less.

1687
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:22,205
Pay for the damages and go.

1688
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:23,208
If we refuse.

1689
01:40:23,417 --> 01:40:25,544
You will stay here only.

1690
01:40:25,919 --> 01:40:27,546
Are you such a great man?

1691
01:40:29,089 --> 01:40:31,887
You must raise hands
for elders like this.

1692
01:40:32,092 --> 01:40:33,719
Well said!

1693
01:40:34,261 --> 01:40:36,058
What's this?
- Can we raise like that on you?

1694
01:40:36,263 --> 01:40:38,390
You can do it tomorrow
go to sleep now.

1695
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:39,224
No need of tomorrow.

1696
01:40:39,433 --> 01:40:43,563
Stop...Stop...
Elderly man is drunk.

1697
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:44,567
You can go quickly, can't you?

1698
01:40:46,774 --> 01:40:48,401
He will take care of them.
You come with us.

1699
01:40:48,609 --> 01:40:49,166
Wait boys!

1700
01:40:49,777 --> 01:40:51,745
Why are you surrounding me?

1701
01:40:52,946 --> 01:40:54,573
No need of fight, come let's have

Why are you holding from behind?

1704
01:41:26,947 --> 01:41:30,075
Two pods of maize are there?
Would you like to eat?

1705
01:41:30,451 --> 01:41:34,251
Would you like to taste the
power and speed of our punch?

1706

Man of great courage is here.

1707

Punch one, two...gulp down
a half and a full bottle.

1725
01:43:06,713 --> 01:43:08,681
Brother, want to down a peg.
- No thanks brother.

1726
01:43:18,725 --> 01:43:19,851
Why are you beating him?

1727
01:43:20,127 --> 01:43:21,185
Will you dare to beat Shankar?

1728
01:43:29,736 --> 01:43:30,862
Why there's a traffic jam here?

1729
01:43:31,738 --> 01:43:32,705
Isn'the that city cab driver?

1730
01:43:32,906 --> 01:43:34,533
He's beating some poor man.

1731
01:43:34,741 --> 01:43:35,867
Did you see him?

1732
01:43:36,076 --> 01:43:37,543
Come.

1733
01:43:40,347 --> 01:43:41,041
Kick the rogues!

1734
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:45,877
Sit down...Sit down.

1735
01:43:48,755 --> 01:43:50,382
What's the trouble?
- Nothing sir.

1736
01:43:50,591 --> 01:43:51,057
Take this bottle.

1737
01:43:51,625 --> 01:43:52,557
Talk something.

1738
01:43:52,759 --> 01:43:53,885
Father...
- What son?

1739
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:22,082
Why are you repeating the same line?
Stop it.

1740
01:44:23,056 --> 01:44:25,115
I am hungry, come let's go.

1741
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:29,429
Have we reached home?
- Yes sir.

1742
01:44:34,201 --> 01:44:34,758
Be careful sir.

1743
01:44:35,736 --> 01:44:38,933
You promised to say something.
You forgot.

1744
01:44:39,139 --> 01:44:39,605
That is...

1745
01:44:48,148 --> 01:44:50,776
Why are you cooking now?
When will you finish it?

1746
01:44:53,053 --> 01:44:55,783
Is it wrong to drink occasionally?

1747
01:44:57,824 --> 01:45:02,955
You scold or beat me but
don't stop talking to me.

1748
01:45:03,163 --> 01:45:04,630
I can't bear it.

1749
01:45:04,831 --> 01:45:08,289
Who is there for us?
Just two of us for each other.

1750
01:45:08,702 --> 01:45:10,465
Dear...what's this?

1751
01:45:14,841 --> 01:45:16,638
This man is responsible
for everything.

1752
01:45:17,344 --> 01:45:20,973
What did he do now?
He's a great writer.

1753
01:45:21,348 --> 01:45:24,476
Is he a writer?
My friend is writer.

1754
01:45:24,685 --> 01:45:26,812
My friend writes and he's
getting credited for it.

1755
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:27,816
Did your friend say that?

1756
01:45:28,021 --> 01:45:29,318
Why would I believe if
anyone else tells?

1757
01:45:29,523 --> 01:45:33,653
I know! My friend is
the writer, Sathyam.

1758
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:34,827
True! I believe you.

1759
01:45:36,063 --> 01:45:37,155
You are not believing me.

1760
01:45:38,198 --> 01:45:40,996
Oh god! What's all these injuries?
- Nothing.

1761
01:45:41,201 --> 01:45:41,667
Get up first!

1762
01:45:45,372 --> 01:45:46,999
You never listen if I say
not to drink.

1763
01:45:50,077 --> 01:45:53,342
Why are you looking at me like that?
- Nothing dear.

1764
01:45:53,547 --> 01:45:57,176
The young writer is my friend.
He's a gentleman.

1765
01:45:57,384 --> 01:46:01,013
My principal is also a gentleman,
he gave a week extension.

1766
01:46:03,056 --> 01:46:03,818
Tea please.

1767
01:46:04,257 --> 01:46:05,884
What's the news?
Any rape case news?

1768
01:46:06,093 --> 01:46:07,560
This man!- Let's go.

1769
01:46:08,128 --> 01:46:08,890
Take tea.

1770
01:46:09,329 --> 01:46:11,058
I don't want in plastic cup,
give me in a glass.

1771
01:46:11,598 --> 01:46:12,565
I will supply in this cup only.

1772
01:46:12,766 --> 01:46:14,563
Take it or leave it.

1773
01:46:15,335 --> 01:46:16,893
You've mistaken me for someone
else and speaking like that.

1774
01:46:17,471 --> 01:46:19,405
Stop!...Sit there.

1775
01:46:21,274 --> 01:46:22,070
Take!

1776
01:46:23,944 --> 01:46:24,740
Did you see the today's newspaper?

1777
01:46:24,945 --> 01:46:25,741
No...why?

1778
01:46:25,946 --> 01:46:26,742
They have found the identity
of that man.

1779
01:46:27,781 --> 01:46:28,611
To cinema?

1780
01:46:31,151 --> 01:46:34,917
You've spoiled your life to
save a rupee condom.

1781
01:46:35,122 --> 01:46:37,090
Condom? Save? Me?

1782
01:46:37,624 --> 01:46:38,249
Yes.

1783
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:41,427
What are you saying sir?
- Look over there.

1784
01:46:47,134 --> 01:46:50,433
What's this?
You've become like this.

1785
01:46:52,305 --> 01:46:53,431
Don't feel sad son!

1786
01:46:53,807 --> 01:46:55,934
Death is inevitable.
- I am innocent sir.

1787
01:46:56,143 --> 01:46:57,940
Every life must die someday.

1788
01:46:58,378 --> 01:47:00,608
But you will die a little
earlier, that's all.

1789
01:47:00,814 --> 01:47:01,644
You go man.

1790
01:47:04,584 --> 01:47:06,609
Bloody rogue!
Are you the Puliraju?

1791
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:08,788
People were tense and eager
to know the identity?

1792
01:47:09,823 --> 01:47:10,949
You need this.

1793
01:47:11,992 --> 01:47:16,122
From a woman to a street dog,
everyone is despising me.

1794
01:47:17,664 --> 01:47:19,131
I will tear it.

1795
01:47:31,878 --> 01:47:35,314
He's Puliraja.
Puliraja will get AlDS.

1796
01:47:38,685 --> 01:47:40,653
Uncle Simhadri.

1797
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:44,416
Give me a good break quickly.
I must settle in life.

1798
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:47,756
Look! Isn'tit good?

1799
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:52,097
Your name?
- Ankita.

1800
01:47:52,299 --> 01:47:54,597
Ankita?
- Why are you surprised?

1801
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:56,769
His name is Ankita, his father's
name is Lalitha.

1802
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:58,597
His brother's name is Pidatha.
Won't you agree?

1803
01:47:58,805 --> 01:47:59,271
Then, okay.

1804
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:08,775
I'm at loss of words,
when you're before me.

1805
01:48:09,149 --> 01:48:16,612
It's rain of honey in heart,
when you gently touch me.

1806
01:48:16,990 --> 01:48:20,790
I must unite with you and
have a glimpse of heaven.

1807
01:48:20,994 --> 01:48:24,293
I must become a part of you.

1808
01:48:24,531 --> 01:48:32,302
I must get drenched in your love.

1809
01:48:32,873 --> 01:48:40,803
Someday let my love get
dedicated to you.

1810
01:48:44,684 --> 01:48:45,150
How are you?

1811
01:48:45,352 --> 01:48:46,979
What's wrong with me?
I'm fine.

1812
01:48:47,187 --> 01:48:49,155
But you fell in the
bus stop that day...

1813
01:48:49,356 --> 01:48:50,823
What happened on that day was...

1814
01:48:51,024 --> 01:48:52,321
A pregnant lady was in my taxi.

1815
01:48:52,559 --> 01:48:54,993
I understood you were going urgently.

1816
01:48:56,029 --> 01:49:02,161
Take the offerings.
- No thanks.

1817
01:49:02,702 --> 01:49:03,327
Open your mouth.

1818
01:49:06,373 --> 01:49:07,169
What's that?

1819
01:49:07,707 --> 01:49:09,174
Don't you think you're
over doing things?

1820
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:12,512
Do we've to offer prayers, get the
offerings and mouth feed you.

1821
01:49:12,712 --> 01:49:14,680
Are you a child? Take it.

1822
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:18,681
No...no, it's impossible to
come to combined studies.

1823
01:49:18,885 --> 01:49:20,182
Dreaming?

1824
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:23,686
That girl is here only.
Can't you express your love to her?

1825
01:49:24,457 --> 01:49:26,687
After I become a writer
and Shankar agrees.

1826
01:49:27,294 --> 01:49:29,353
For other's, marriage is
the end of love.

1827
01:49:29,563 --> 01:49:31,030
For me, marriage is the
starting point of love.

1828
01:49:31,665 --> 01:49:32,188
What's this sir?

1829
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:33,866
If I go home, they say
to Prakash studio.

1830
01:49:34,067 --> 01:49:35,193
If I go to Prakash studio,
they say he's here.

1831
01:49:35,402 --> 01:49:37,029
When I came here,
you say he has gone to home.

1832
01:49:37,237 --> 01:49:38,534
I'm saying because he has
really gone home. Go.

1833
01:49:38,738 --> 01:49:40,365
Don't say like that.
He's here only.

1834
01:49:40,574 --> 01:49:41,040
Isn'tthat his car?

1835
01:49:41,241 --> 01:49:45,871
Why're you talking too much?
- Try to understand.

1836
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:46,704
This is my life.

1837
01:49:46,947 --> 01:49:48,039
What's the problem, Mahesh?

1838
01:49:48,281 --> 01:49:50,545
I want to meet you once.
He's not allowing me in.

1839
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:52,217
Come in...send him in... - Go.

1840
01:49:54,421 --> 01:49:56,889
My name is Sathyam.
These are my songs.

1841
01:49:57,090 --> 01:49:58,057
Okay, give it to him.

1842
01:49:58,291 --> 01:50:00,725
It'll be good to hear.
Suggest a tune and test me.

1843
01:50:00,927 --> 01:50:02,224
Tune? Are you going to
tunes so fast?

1844
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:03,054
Don't say like that sir?

1845
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:04,389
You give chance to new comers.

1846
01:50:04,598 --> 01:50:05,724
That's alright. I don't have time.
Give it to my assistant.

1847
01:50:05,932 --> 01:50:06,398
I will see later.

1848
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,396
Sir, it's break time now.

1849
01:50:09,302 --> 01:50:11,065
You're a pain... Come.

1850
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:14,069
How much time it will take?
- 30 minutes.

1851
01:50:14,441 --> 01:50:15,066
You sit down.

1852
01:50:15,775 --> 01:50:16,571
Come, sit here.

1853
01:50:29,789 --> 01:50:30,255
This is the tune.

1859
01:51:11,064 --> 01:51:15,330
I wrote a poem on you
becoming legendary Kalidas.

1860
01:51:15,869 --> 01:51:25,835
Going without food
and sleepless,

1861
01:51:26,546 --> 01:51:30,676
...l searched you day in
and night out to attract you.

1862
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:41,554
I grew a beard like
forlorn lover Devadas.

From morning sunlight to

Your thoughts have
besieged my heart.

Oh maiden! Is it your trap?

01:54:24,724 --> 01:54:29,184
Though I can get a million of
beauties in a snap of finger.

1874
01:54:29,562 --> 01:54:31,860
When I insist on getting you only.

1875
01:54:32,065 --> 01:54:34,192
Why are you getting angry on me?

1876
01:54:39,806 --> 01:54:44,709
They fall in love if
you're crazy.

1877
01:54:45,078 --> 01:54:49,378
Closer you come to them with
true love, farther they go.

1878
01:54:49,749 --> 01:54:54,550
Oh maiden! Is it justified?

1879
01:54:55,088 --> 01:54:59,889
Is love a curse on my heart?

1880
01:55:00,093 --> 01:55:02,391
My heart has become a burden.

1881
01:55:02,595 --> 01:55:05,223
Without a response from you,
it has become barren.

1882
01:55:31,391 --> 01:55:46,102
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

1883
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:48,102
Very good.

1884
01:55:52,979 --> 01:55:53,775
Shall we hear that song once?

1885
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:54,446
Definitely!

1886
01:55:56,015 --> 01:55:57,607
Sathyam, wait outside,
I'll come.

1887
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:02,117
Sorry sir, your song was excellent.

1888
01:56:08,494 --> 01:56:09,791
Chakri has told about you.

1889
01:56:10,163 --> 01:56:11,460
You're writing 3 songs
in this movie.

1890
01:56:11,664 --> 01:56:14,792
3 songs!... Really sir?

1891
01:56:15,001 --> 01:56:15,467
Yes.

1892
01:56:16,836 --> 01:56:18,963
Your song is also good
like your Guru's.

1893
01:56:19,172 --> 01:56:20,139
You've a bright future.

1894
01:56:21,841 --> 01:56:24,469
Our movie is opening next week.
Come with your family.

1895
01:56:24,844 --> 01:56:26,812
Come and collect the tunes tomorrow.
- Okay sir.

1896
01:56:33,586 --> 01:56:35,486
Then, let's have a go at it.

1897
01:56:35,688 --> 01:56:36,985
I'm handing over the
food dept. to you.

1898
01:56:37,190 --> 01:56:37,815
You select an auspicious time.

1899
01:56:38,024 --> 01:56:39,491
No, let's get it done
by a good astrologer.

1900
01:56:39,692 --> 01:56:42,490
Uncle Lingam, marriage hall, band
& financial matters are yours.

1901
01:56:42,695 --> 01:56:43,320
Let's create a sensation.

1902
01:56:43,529 --> 01:56:44,655
Let's have a howdah on the elephant.

1903
01:56:44,864 --> 01:56:45,831
No please, I'm scared of elephants.

1904
01:56:46,032 --> 01:56:47,158
Why to fear?
I'll stay next to you.

1905
01:56:47,367 --> 01:56:48,493
What if the elephant
gets scared then?

1906
01:56:48,701 --> 01:56:49,497
Where are you Sathyam?

1907
01:56:49,702 --> 01:56:50,669
We all are here only.

1908
01:56:53,039 --> 01:56:54,336
Along with it tell your
love matter also.

1909
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:55,006
Okay?

1910
01:56:55,208 --> 01:56:57,676
Why're you guys bubbling with joy?

1911
01:56:57,877 --> 01:56:59,174
Sathyam has become
a writer on his own.

1912
01:57:00,747 --> 01:57:03,682
Our boy has earned fame and status.

1913
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:06,682
I'll tell him, Uncle.
You come in sir.

1914
01:57:06,886 --> 01:57:07,352
Come.

1915
01:57:08,421 --> 01:57:10,855
You promised to tell
later something in the bar.

1916
01:57:11,224 --> 01:57:12,350
What did you promise to say?
- That same thing.

1917
01:57:12,558 --> 01:57:13,183
Then, go ahead...

1918
01:57:13,559 --> 01:57:14,355
How to tell him?

1919
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:16,357
Why're you whispering
among yourselves?

1920
01:57:16,562 --> 01:57:19,030
Nothing sir... our boy...
- What's it?

1921
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:20,859
That's it... - What is that?

1922
01:57:22,068 --> 01:57:23,194
I will tell! - Tell me.

1923
01:57:23,736 --> 01:57:25,363
I will tell sir.
- Come on tell me.

1924
01:57:25,571 --> 01:57:26,538
Nothing, our man has
fallen in love.

1925
01:57:28,107 --> 01:57:30,541
Love? - Yes.

1926
01:57:30,777 --> 01:57:32,369
Why didn't you tell me till now?

1927
01:57:32,578 --> 01:57:33,545
He hasn't expressed it
to the girl also.

1928
01:57:33,746 --> 01:57:34,371
What? - Yes.

1929
01:57:34,747 --> 01:57:35,543
Why?

1930
01:57:35,748 --> 01:57:39,878
It's better to talk to
her parents than to her.

1931
01:57:40,086 --> 01:57:43,715
True! If you tell her first,
she will accept.

1932
01:57:43,923 --> 01:57:45,390
Later they will go
and tell their parents.

1933
01:57:45,591 --> 01:57:46,888
Their parents say no
and you will be dejected.

1934
01:57:47,126 --> 01:57:50,892
It's better this way that's it!
Did you tell?

1935
01:57:51,531 --> 01:57:54,227
I'm confused how to tell.
- What's there?

1936
01:57:54,434 --> 01:57:59,565
I love your daughter.
I want to marry your daughter.

1937
01:57:59,772 --> 01:58:01,740
I will take care of her with love...

1938
01:58:01,941 --> 01:58:04,239
...Please agree sir,
say like that.

1939
01:58:04,444 --> 01:58:07,743
I love your daughter.
I want to marry her.

1940
01:58:08,481 --> 01:58:10,244
I will take care of her with love.

1941
01:58:10,750 --> 01:58:12,581
Please agree.

1942
01:58:12,819 --> 01:58:15,913
Super! Very good.
Repeat just like this.

1943
01:58:16,155 --> 01:58:18,248
I will look after your daughter
better than you sir.

1944
01:58:18,858 --> 01:58:19,790
Please agree.

1945
01:58:19,959 --> 01:58:23,918
Oh! He's a poet!
Good improvisation.

1946
01:58:24,130 --> 01:58:25,427
Please agree.

1947
01:58:25,798 --> 01:58:27,925
They will not agree immediately.

1948
01:58:28,301 --> 01:58:29,768
You can request once again like this.

1949
01:58:30,803 --> 01:58:31,599
Agree sir.

1950
01:58:31,804 --> 01:58:33,101
Don't repeat...

1951
01:58:45,651 --> 01:58:47,278
Never again come to my house.

1952
01:58:53,159 --> 01:58:54,626
Do come as my son-in-law.

1953
01:58:54,861 --> 01:58:56,453
Son-in-law!

1954
01:59:01,834 --> 01:59:04,302
I will tell this happy news
to my daughter. - No.

1955
01:59:05,004 --> 01:59:07,632
She will finish her studies
in another 2 or 3 months.

1956
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:09,307
My songs will also be
released by then.

1957
01:59:09,509 --> 01:59:10,976
It will be good to tell her then.

1958
01:59:11,210 --> 01:59:13,303
No need to disturb her
studies unnecessarily.

1959
01:59:14,013 --> 01:59:15,981
You got an idea which
I didn't get as a father.

1960
01:59:17,517 --> 01:59:18,449
You will marry only
after her studies.

1961
01:59:26,692 --> 01:59:27,818
Brother.

1962
01:59:29,529 --> 01:59:29,995
Brother.

1963
01:59:33,366 --> 01:59:34,333
Don't cry.

1964
01:59:37,703 --> 01:59:38,328
Look.

1965
01:59:49,115 --> 01:59:51,675
I'll go away.
- Brother, don't go away.

1966
01:59:58,224 --> 01:59:59,350
Where are you going away?
Stay here.

1967
01:59:59,725 --> 02:00:01,022
No problem brother.

1968
02:00:13,072 --> 02:00:13,868
Go carefully dear.

1969
02:00:14,073 --> 02:00:15,540
Bye mother. - Bye dear.

1970
02:00:15,741 --> 02:00:16,366
Bye father.

1971
02:00:25,418 --> 02:00:26,043
Brother.

1972
02:00:28,087 --> 02:00:30,555
Father...no please...no...

1973
02:00:30,756 --> 02:00:32,053
Is it nice?

1974
02:00:37,263 --> 02:00:38,560
I will introduce my husband to you.

1975
02:00:39,432 --> 02:00:40,057
Come.

1976
02:00:41,934 --> 02:00:43,401
I've got an offer to
go to America.

1977
02:00:43,603 --> 02:00:44,729
I must pay a lakh
by today evening.

1978
02:00:45,271 --> 02:00:47,239
Why would a man lending
a lakh became my friend?

1979
02:00:48,107 --> 02:00:53,409
Are you fine?
- What? Do you know my brother?

1980
02:00:54,113 --> 02:00:58,243
Your brother is responsible
for my America trip.

1981
02:00:59,785 --> 02:01:00,479
Leave it man.

1982
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:01,948
Really sorry man.

1983
02:01:02,121 --> 02:01:04,919
I heard about your problems in the
family for giving money to me.

1984
02:01:05,625 --> 02:01:07,923
I couldn't think of
any way to help you.

1985
02:01:08,127 --> 02:01:10,595
That's why, I agreed
to marry Swathi.

1986
02:01:10,796 --> 02:01:13,765
Of course, I love Swathi.

1987
02:01:13,966 --> 02:01:15,433
You married her for love, haven't you?

1988
02:01:15,668 --> 02:01:17,260
Then, look after her well.

1989
02:01:17,470 --> 02:01:18,596
Come, let's go and tell
your father the truth.

1990
02:01:18,804 --> 02:01:20,772
Do you want to earn a
bad name for you too?

1991
02:01:25,244 --> 02:01:26,973
She's angry for hiding
it from her also.

1992
02:01:27,313 --> 02:01:29,281
No Sathyam. - Stop it.

1993
02:01:29,482 --> 02:01:30,449
That's... - I've forgiven you.

1994
02:01:30,650 --> 02:01:31,947
Okay? Go and console her.

1995
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:41,949
Look after my sister well.
Don't cry.

1996
02:01:42,695 --> 02:01:43,627
You move man.

1997
02:01:45,331 --> 02:01:45,956
That man!

1998
02:01:46,165 --> 02:01:48,133
Your father and you had problems
because of him only.

1999
02:01:48,834 --> 02:01:50,631
Why are you beating me?
- Respect.

2000
02:01:50,836 --> 02:01:53,634
Brother-in-law!
- Okay buddy.

2001
02:01:55,007 --> 02:01:56,804
Why did you beat me again?
- Writer!

2002
02:01:57,009 --> 02:01:58,806
Writer Sathyam.

2003
02:01:59,512 --> 02:02:04,973
Dream of seeing my name as
writer on screen is coming true.

2004
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:06,981
If you respect me now.

2005
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:10,148
When you need money for
a peg or medicine.

2006
02:02:10,356 --> 02:02:12,483
I will permit you to ask
my doctor wife.

2007
02:02:13,526 --> 02:02:14,322
Where are you going now?

2008
02:02:14,527 --> 02:02:16,154
You will not believe,
to Ankita's friend's reception.

2009
02:02:16,362 --> 02:02:17,488
Ankita is also coming,
will you also come?

2010
02:02:17,863 --> 02:02:18,830
Really?...Come.

2011
02:02:19,031 --> 02:02:19,656
Move!

2012
02:02:32,378 --> 02:02:33,675
Hubby! My younger sister-in-law.

2013
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:35,411
Ankita, your friends have come.

2014
02:02:35,614 --> 02:02:36,706
Ask them to sit.
I'll come in a second.

2015
02:02:36,916 --> 02:02:39,248
Come...come. - This is not for you,
it is for the guests.

2016
02:02:39,452 --> 02:02:41,818
Hello buddy!
Sorry writer Mr.Sathyam.

2017
02:02:42,021 --> 02:02:45,184
Are you imagining your
reception with the Doctor?

2018
02:02:45,391 --> 02:02:48,087
No, writer's sister's reception.

2019
02:02:48,427 --> 02:02:49,792
Next to her, Doctor Sister-in-law.

2020
02:02:49,995 --> 02:02:50,927
Dreaming again?

2021
02:02:51,430 --> 02:02:54,558
When all my dreams are coming true.

2022
02:02:55,234 --> 02:02:56,758
It's very pleasant to dream.

2023
02:03:01,374 --> 02:03:01,999
You...

2024
02:03:06,011 --> 02:03:07,478
Why did you come so late?

2025
02:03:15,588 --> 02:03:17,988
I want to talk to you Ankita,
please come with me.

2026
02:03:25,197 --> 02:03:26,095
What is the matter Prakash?

2027
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:35,234
Can I talk to your parents
about our marriage?

2028
02:03:35,474 --> 02:03:36,372
You can.

2029
02:03:40,045 --> 02:03:42,741
You can...

2030
02:03:43,015 --> 02:03:43,811
This is enough Ankita.

2031
02:03:44,016 --> 02:03:46,712
As soon as I finish my studies,
I will come with my parents.

2032
02:03:46,919 --> 02:03:48,079
I am telling you now.

2033
02:03:48,287 --> 02:03:50,084
This marriage will happen
only if my father agrees.

2034
02:03:50,289 --> 02:03:52,052
If he refuses...

2035
02:03:52,258 --> 02:03:55,022
You come to my marriage,
I will come to your marriage.

2036
02:03:55,461 --> 02:03:59,659
No parent will refuse if any one
approaches them like you.

2037
02:04:02,501 --> 02:04:05,629
We have planned a tour to
Ooty after our examinations.

2038
02:04:05,838 --> 02:04:07,931
You must come.
- You must ask, will you come?

2039
02:04:09,575 --> 02:04:10,200
Will you come?

2040
02:04:10,943 --> 02:04:12,376
No, I will not come.
You carry on.

2041
02:04:14,613 --> 02:04:16,205
Will you come at least to
give us a send off?

2042
02:04:16,749 --> 02:04:17,647
Let me try.

2043
02:04:20,519 --> 02:04:21,144
Let me try.

2044
02:04:28,727 --> 02:04:30,388
Buddy, where are you going?

2045
02:04:30,596 --> 02:04:31,756
I have some work. I must go.

2046
02:04:32,264 --> 02:04:33,492
Why are you going away
without having food?

2047
02:04:36,068 --> 02:04:36,864
Do you've sense?

2048
02:04:38,137 --> 02:04:38,899
Why are you here?

2049
02:04:39,905 --> 02:04:40,929
You...in that bar.

2050
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:43,973
Why did you come here?
What work do you have here?

2051
02:04:45,344 --> 02:04:46,333
That day in bar...

2052
02:04:49,148 --> 02:04:50,877
What's the problem?
What happened?

2053
02:04:51,083 --> 02:04:53,142
He was passing comments on
my sister. Ask him.

2054
02:04:54,753 --> 02:04:55,378
Who are you man?

2055
02:04:55,588 --> 02:04:56,816
This has become a routine now.

2056
02:04:57,022 --> 02:04:59,923
They come under the garb of catering
and misbehave with women.

2057
02:05:00,125 --> 02:05:01,114
Throw them out first.

2058
02:05:01,327 --> 02:05:02,294
Nasty people.

2059
02:05:02,595 --> 02:05:05,621
Aren't you ashamed to misbehave
in a reception?

2060
02:05:05,831 --> 02:05:06,957
Please listen to me sir.
- Don't watch. Call the police.

2061
02:05:07,166 --> 02:05:07,962
No need of police.

2062
02:05:08,167 --> 02:05:10,135
If we take them to the backyard
and break their bones.

2063
02:05:10,336 --> 02:05:11,200
Leave him...leave him.

2064
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:15,898
You don't know Ankita.
He is misbehaving with women here.

2065
02:05:16,108 --> 02:05:16,904
Actually what had happened was...

2066
02:05:17,109 --> 02:05:20,670
You don't talk. I know very well
about you. - Please listen to me.

2067
02:05:23,716 --> 02:05:24,444
Come Prakash.

2068
02:05:24,650 --> 02:05:26,447
Don't pick up fights with
third rate people like him.

2069
02:05:26,752 --> 02:05:28,014
Come, let's go.

2070
02:05:51,477 --> 02:05:53,172
Which loan you want me
to sanction?

2071
02:05:53,379 --> 02:05:56,109
I have sanctioned every
available loan.

2072
02:05:56,315 --> 02:05:58,340
What else can I do?
- Leave me sir.

2073
02:05:59,084 --> 02:06:00,881
Keep quiet sir.
Don't stop me.

2074
02:06:01,086 --> 02:06:03,816
Don't help me, don't sanction
any loan to me,

2075
02:06:04,023 --> 02:06:05,388
That's why I am going to
put my hand into it.

2076
02:06:05,591 --> 02:06:07,525
If I lose my hand,
I will get insurance.

2077
02:06:07,726 --> 02:06:09,785
That's why, I placing my hand into it.
- Have you gone mad Shankar?

2078
02:06:10,563 --> 02:06:11,894
What's this sir?
- You don't know anything Sathyam.

2079
02:06:12,097 --> 02:06:13,758
What are you doing?
- Please, don't stop me.

2080
02:06:13,966 --> 02:06:15,297
I need Rs.2 lakhs urgently.

2081
02:06:15,501 --> 02:06:17,401
Put your head into it, you'll get
Rs.10 lakhs. Will it be enough?

2082
02:06:17,636 --> 02:06:19,069
I don't have any other way.

2083
02:06:20,139 --> 02:06:23,006
I must pay Rs.2 lakhs fees
for my daughter.

2084
02:06:23,208 --> 02:06:23,970
I will give you the money.

2085
02:06:24,176 --> 02:06:25,734
How can you?
- You don't worry about it.

2086
02:06:25,945 --> 02:06:26,877
Am I not saying
I will give you.

2087
02:06:27,079 --> 02:06:28,273
You are going to be
my son-in-law.

2088
02:06:28,747 --> 02:06:30,214
I shouldn't take money from you.

2089
02:06:31,383 --> 02:06:32,748
That's when I became
your son-in-law, isn't it?

2090
02:06:32,952 --> 02:06:34,579
Not that, listen to me.

2091
02:06:35,154 --> 02:06:36,314
You don't talk any further.

2092
02:06:36,889 --> 02:06:39,517
I will give you the money
by today evening. Okay?

2093
02:06:40,926 --> 02:06:44,362
Mr.Chakri is there? - He has gone to
foreign. He'll come after a week.

2094
02:06:44,997 --> 02:06:45,964
What about the producers?

2095
02:06:46,465 --> 02:06:47,796
I will call you later sir.

2096
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:48,967
They have also gone
along with him.

2097
02:06:50,069 --> 02:06:53,869
Any contact number?
- No. Any problem Sathyam?

2098
02:07:05,884 --> 02:07:09,183
After all the doors are closed on you.
You remembered me.

2099
02:07:09,388 --> 02:07:12,789
Why should I give you money?
- Sir, don't say like that.

2100
02:07:14,293 --> 02:07:16,659
If you take all the songs,
I've written till now and pay me.

2101
02:07:16,862 --> 02:07:17,988
I will get what you've written.

2102
02:07:18,197 --> 02:07:20,563
What about the songs you will
write in future?

2103
02:07:21,266 --> 02:07:22,858
Independently you are writing
songs for Chakri...

2104
02:07:23,068 --> 02:07:26,299
How many songs? - 3 songs.
- You are writing 3 songs.

2105
02:07:26,505 --> 02:07:28,097
When those songs are released,

2106
02:07:28,607 --> 02:07:30,802
you will grow.

2107
02:07:31,010 --> 02:07:33,444
Do I've to watch you growing?

2108
02:07:34,113 --> 02:07:37,082
It's difficult to get a name
in this industry.

2109
02:07:37,383 --> 02:07:39,408
It's much more difficult
to keep it up.

2110
02:07:39,718 --> 02:07:41,083
I am in that process now.

2111
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:42,780
I beg you sir.

2112
02:07:43,522 --> 02:07:44,580
You want me to think.

2113
02:07:45,391 --> 02:07:47,985
There is only one reply
how many times I may think?

2114
02:07:50,396 --> 02:07:52,193
You must never write again.

2115
02:07:53,399 --> 02:07:56,994
If you ever write,
it must be for me only.

2116
02:07:57,770 --> 02:07:59,601
If you want money
agree to my condition.

2117
02:08:00,272 --> 02:08:03,173
If you don't want money and
have plans to try your luck.

2118
02:08:09,281 --> 02:08:10,873
Think and tell me.

2119
02:08:16,622 --> 02:08:18,487
Where are you going man?

2120
02:08:20,893 --> 02:08:21,882
Ankita's fee must be paid.

2121
02:08:22,094 --> 02:08:23,618
What are you talking man?

2122
02:08:24,096 --> 02:08:26,792
Spoiling your bright future...

2123
02:08:26,999 --> 02:08:28,057
She must become a doctor.

2124
02:08:29,735 --> 02:08:33,364
Why are you worried if your
lover is doctor or a nurse?

2125
02:08:35,207 --> 02:08:36,606
But I love her.

2126
02:08:42,081 --> 02:08:43,446
If you act too smart,
he may go away.

2127
02:09:01,333 --> 02:09:03,528
Come, let's go and pay the fees.

2128
02:09:05,404 --> 02:09:06,632
Hasn't your father come yet?

2129
02:09:07,172 --> 02:09:08,833
I am waiting here for him only.

2130
02:09:09,041 --> 02:09:11,100
You carry on, I will come.
- Okay.

2131
02:09:19,284 --> 02:09:21,115
What are you doing here?
Get going.

2132
02:09:22,154 --> 02:09:25,521
Buddy, your chic is waiting downstairs.
Why don't you go and tease her?

2133
02:09:25,858 --> 02:09:28,349
If I go and tease her now,
it'll backfire on me.

2134
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:30,892
She's waiting to pay
Rs.2 lakhs college fees.

2135
02:09:31,897 --> 02:09:33,023
Is it necessary now?

2136
02:09:33,265 --> 02:09:34,061
Can't you pay it?

2137
02:09:34,266 --> 02:09:35,995
Your father is a millionaire.

2138
02:09:36,735 --> 02:09:38,794
My father paid to all women he had
affairs and become a millionaire.

2139
02:09:39,004 --> 02:09:40,198
He was once a billionaire.

2140
02:09:40,405 --> 02:09:43,033
Ankita will not get the certificate
if she fails to pay the fees.

2141
02:09:43,242 --> 02:09:44,266
Why are you worried for her?

2142
02:09:44,743 --> 02:09:45,732
Why would I be worried?

2143
02:09:45,944 --> 02:09:47,775
She may not come to
send off us to Ooty.

2144
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:49,945
Not only just send off
she'll come to Ooty also.

2145
02:09:50,149 --> 02:09:51,776
How is it possible?
What are you saying?

2146
02:09:51,984 --> 02:09:53,884
Truth! Wait and see.

2147
02:09:54,119 --> 02:09:55,416
Didn't get you buddy?

2148
02:09:56,088 --> 02:09:56,952
...Study man.

2149
02:10:01,927 --> 02:10:03,053
I will pay the fees and come.

2150
02:10:10,536 --> 02:10:13,562
Looks like you had
tough time to pay.

2151
02:10:14,106 --> 02:10:16,973
Tough time! I thought I may
not be able to pay.

2152
02:10:17,509 --> 02:10:19,136
My future son-in-law is god.

2153
02:10:19,478 --> 02:10:21,070
He understood my difficulty
and gave me money.

2154
02:10:21,914 --> 02:10:25,350
In short any word of praise
will fall short before him.

2155
02:10:30,189 --> 02:10:32,885
Madam, I want to talk to you.

2156
02:10:33,091 --> 02:10:35,787
Please, leave me alone.
I am already tensed.

2157
02:10:35,994 --> 02:10:37,723
My friend is a...
- Is he a Buddha?

2158
02:10:37,930 --> 02:10:39,261
What happened at
the reception was...

2159
02:10:39,464 --> 02:10:41,364
Did he come there to get 'rakhis'
tied by beautiful girls?

2160
02:10:41,567 --> 02:10:44,365
If you cut me short for everything...
- Don't say another word about him.

2161
02:10:44,570 --> 02:10:46,595
Rogue, rowdy, wastrel, you take him
whatever you feel like.

2162
02:10:46,805 --> 02:10:47,863
But today for you...

2163
02:10:48,073 --> 02:10:49,438
I don't care even if
he threatens to die.

2164
02:10:49,641 --> 02:10:52,371
He will not die. If he wasn't here
today you would've...

2165
02:10:53,245 --> 02:10:55,042
What's this? Stop it.

2166
02:10:57,382 --> 02:10:59,213
Sorry, he blabbered in ignorance.

2167
02:10:59,418 --> 02:11:00,510
No play acts please.

2168
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:03,586
If you've any shame left in you,
never show up your face again.

2169
02:11:11,964 --> 02:11:12,931
Are you waiting here?

2170
02:11:13,565 --> 02:11:15,499
I have paid the fees.

2171
02:11:16,001 --> 02:11:18,993
My daughter is now Dr.Ankita.

2172
02:11:21,206 --> 02:11:24,198
My desire and your ambition
are fulfilled.

2173
02:11:24,409 --> 02:11:25,671
You are coming, aren't you Ankita?

2174
02:11:25,944 --> 02:11:27,673
We are leaving from
college today evening.

2175
02:11:28,313 --> 02:11:33,148
My friends are going to Ooty.
Can I go to send them off?

2176
02:11:33,385 --> 02:11:37,481
Go dear! I've some work in
the office. Go... - Okay.

2177
02:11:39,157 --> 02:11:40,215
What a lousy life is yours!

2178
02:11:41,026 --> 02:11:42,550
God didn't write bad fate for you.

2179
02:11:42,761 --> 02:11:44,058
Your his wrong creation.

2180
02:11:44,263 --> 02:11:46,561
That's why your father threw you
out at very young age.

2181
02:11:46,765 --> 02:11:49,996
The people who you want to prosper
hate to see your face.

2182
02:11:50,369 --> 02:11:51,734
You pounce on us
at the drop of hat.

2183
02:11:51,937 --> 02:11:54,132
You became speechless
before them. Why?

2184
02:11:54,439 --> 02:11:55,963
Everyone has enemies outside.

2185
02:11:56,174 --> 02:11:58,574
But you are an enemy
to yourself. Watch.

2186
02:11:58,777 --> 02:12:00,904
You didn't see your sister's marriage
which you wanted to see.

2187
02:12:01,113 --> 02:12:02,580
You will see Ankita's marriage,
which you don't want to.

2188
02:12:02,781 --> 02:12:04,806
It will happen before your eyes,
read my lips.

2189
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:13,422
I can't bear to see it. That's why,
I am leaving this place for good.

2190
02:12:15,127 --> 02:12:16,424
What's this?

2191
02:12:16,628 --> 02:12:19,096
Get down.
- Listen to me.

2192
02:12:20,799 --> 02:12:21,424
Get down.

2193
02:12:23,001 --> 02:12:43,116
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

2194
02:12:43,989 --> 02:12:49,791
Love will not respond to
your distress calls.

2195
02:12:51,163 --> 02:12:56,294
Love will not fall for desires.

2196
02:12:58,170 --> 02:13:02,630
Love is an unachievable boon.

2197
02:13:02,841 --> 02:13:06,800
Heart's first sorrow.

2198
02:13:07,012 --> 02:13:11,472
Love is pleasant.
Love is safety.

2199
02:13:11,683 --> 02:13:13,810
Nothing is instant.

2200
02:13:14,019 --> 02:13:16,317
Everything is love.

2201
02:13:36,375 --> 02:14:20,315
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

2202
02:14:20,585 --> 02:14:25,045
Isn'tit my mistake to consider
love as a rain drop?

2203
02:14:25,257 --> 02:14:29,557
Can't avoid this pain after
knowing love in a typhoon?

2204
02:14:29,928 --> 02:14:34,058
How long do I've to swim
against the tide?

2205
02:14:34,599 --> 02:14:39,059
How long do I've to bear
this pain in heart?

2206
02:14:39,271 --> 02:14:43,901
Love is not a game.
There are no wins and loses.

2207
02:14:44,109 --> 02:14:48,239
Don't calculate profit and loss,
it is not love.

2208
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:51,010
If there is any mistake
it is not love's.

2209
02:14:51,216 --> 02:14:57,416
It's mine who loved you,
my love...my love.

2210
02:14:58,223 --> 02:15:02,421
Love...love...love.

2211
02:15:15,474 --> 02:15:16,270
Stop it father.

2212
02:15:16,575 --> 02:15:20,602
He didn't marry me because
I am Aishwarya Rai or Miss lndia.

2213
02:15:20,812 --> 02:15:22,040
He married me because
I am Sathyam's sister.

2214
02:15:24,483 --> 02:15:25,609
You don't take it wrong sir.

2215
02:15:26,251 --> 02:15:28,219
Your son didn't get the job
on his own merit.

2216
02:15:28,987 --> 02:15:32,616
Sathyam paid bribe getting
beaten up for that.

2217
02:15:32,991 --> 02:15:49,329
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

2218
02:15:50,008 --> 02:15:54,468
Have the black nights chasing
my heart become my love?

2219
02:15:54,746 --> 02:15:59,308
An unknown pain till now,
will it become a furnace?

2220
02:15:59,518 --> 02:16:08,324
Somehow I must stop it.
Will you tell me, my love?

2221
02:16:08,860 --> 02:16:13,422
I wanted to become
your shadow, my dear.

2222
02:16:13,632 --> 02:16:18,092
Today only truth
has dawned on me.

2223
02:16:18,303 --> 02:16:23,002
Earth and sky will never meet.
Shadow will never touch the body of man.

2224
02:16:41,226 --> 02:16:42,693
Let's go to Ooty.
I'll take you to task.

2225
02:16:43,228 --> 02:16:44,195
I've seen many
challenging like you.

2226
02:16:44,396 --> 02:16:46,193
Okay Prakash. I'll take
leave now. - So soon?

2227
02:16:46,398 --> 02:16:47,797
There's lot of time for
the train to leave.

2228
02:16:47,999 --> 02:16:49,694
No, my father will be
waiting for me.

2229
02:16:49,901 --> 02:16:50,526
I will go.

2230
02:16:52,337 --> 02:16:54,032
Ajay! What's this?

2231
02:16:54,239 --> 02:16:59,040
What's this fun? Prakash ask him
to open the door.

2232
02:17:08,753 --> 02:17:09,378
I must go.

2233
02:17:09,754 --> 02:17:12,552
No going, you are coming.
You must come to Ooty with us.

2234
02:17:15,093 --> 02:17:16,390
Inform your father on phone.

2235
02:17:18,763 --> 02:17:19,889
You called me to send off,

2236
02:17:20,098 --> 02:17:22,066
and why did you book my ticket
without my knowledge?

2237
02:17:22,267 --> 02:17:23,063
Why should I ask you?

2238
02:17:30,108 --> 02:17:32,076
Why did you take the
flower I presented?

2239
02:17:33,612 --> 02:17:37,241
I take flowers from a
flower seller everyday.

2240
02:17:40,952 --> 02:17:45,412
Funny? What is so funny about this?

2241
02:17:47,459 --> 02:17:49,086
You tell me.
What is funny in it?

2242
02:17:50,395 --> 02:17:55,094
I was after you like a dog for
4 years. Is that funny to you?

2243
02:17:55,800 --> 02:17:58,598
I acted like a good guy to
impress you. Is that funny to you?

2244
02:17:59,638 --> 02:18:02,368
I took great pains to appear
like a gentleman to you.

2245
02:18:02,574 --> 02:18:03,438
Is that funny to you?

2246
02:18:06,144 --> 02:18:09,272
What I think must happen.
What I desire must become mine.

2247
02:18:09,648 --> 02:18:10,945
You are coming. That's all.

2248
02:18:11,483 --> 02:18:13,610
Leave her Prakash.
Aren't we here for you?

2249
02:18:13,818 --> 02:18:17,447
He got bored with you,
that's why he selected her.

2250
02:18:17,722 --> 02:18:18,780
Bloody rogue.

2251
02:18:23,495 --> 02:18:25,463
What would you like to have?
Shall I give a biscuit?

2252
02:18:30,335 --> 02:18:31,461
Sathyam is there.

2253
02:18:31,670 --> 02:18:33,638
Sathyam...stop.

2254
02:18:46,951 --> 02:18:48,145
I must go.

2255
02:18:51,356 --> 02:18:52,653
Allow me to go please.

2256
02:19:09,874 --> 02:19:10,499
Ankita stop.

2257
02:19:13,712 --> 02:19:14,440
Ankita, come here.

2258
02:19:14,646 --> 02:19:16,511
Why are you calling her
in public? This is wrong.

2259
02:19:16,715 --> 02:19:18,842
This is a problem between us.
You keep...

2260
02:19:19,050 --> 02:19:21,348
Don't talk disrespectfully.
- Do you know us?

2261
02:19:21,553 --> 02:19:23,180
Whoever it may be
a wrong is a wrong.

2262
02:19:23,388 --> 02:19:25,185
You are always seen wherever she is.

2263
02:19:25,390 --> 02:19:26,857
What's your relationship with her?

2264
02:19:29,728 --> 02:19:30,695
You come.

2265
02:19:30,895 --> 02:19:33,022
Don't touch her.
- Stop.

2266
02:19:34,399 --> 02:19:35,024
Stop.

2267
02:19:35,567 --> 02:19:36,363
Who are you?

2268
02:19:39,404 --> 02:19:41,201
Come.

2269
02:19:42,574 --> 02:19:43,199
Come.

2270
02:19:46,745 --> 02:19:49,145
Didn't I tell you not to touch her?

2271
02:21:18,503 --> 02:21:20,471
Stop Sathyam.
Where are you going away?

2272
02:21:20,672 --> 02:21:22,970
Listen to me.
- Sir, you listen to me.

2273
02:21:23,341 --> 02:21:24,638
Take care of your daughter.

2274
02:21:27,512 --> 02:21:28,137
Take care.

2275
02:21:29,347 --> 02:21:30,143
Sathyam...stop.

2276
02:21:30,348 --> 02:21:32,316
Do you know him father?

2277
02:21:32,684 --> 02:21:35,312
How can I not know him?
He's Sathyam.

2278
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:36,316
My Sathyam.

2279
02:21:36,688 --> 02:21:38,986
Don't I always say about a
good writer and a good man?

2280
02:21:39,190 --> 02:21:39,815
He is that man.

2281
02:21:40,625 --> 02:21:42,149
Though you don't love him
which he knows.

2282
02:21:42,694 --> 02:21:45,162
He still loves you
more than his life.

2283
02:21:47,365 --> 02:21:51,324
He sold his future to pay your fees.

2284
02:21:52,036 --> 02:21:55,665
In this modern time where young boys
chase girls like mad dogs.

2285
02:21:55,874 --> 02:22:01,176
He's a responsible youth who asked the
girl's father's permission to love.

2286
02:22:16,227 --> 02:22:19,526
Ankita, we have blood
relationship between us.

2287
02:22:19,797 --> 02:22:22,595
But though he is in
no way related to me.

2288
02:22:23,134 --> 02:22:24,601
When I see him going away...

2289
02:22:26,738 --> 02:22:29,206
He is more to me than you.
Stop him dear.

2290
02:22:29,407 --> 02:22:31,375
You are the only one
who can stop him.

2291
02:22:34,913 --> 02:22:39,373
Love can't be stopped.

2292
02:22:39,584 --> 02:22:43,884
Love can't be hidden.

2293
02:22:44,255 --> 02:22:48,715
Love will unite 2 hearts.

2294
02:22:48,927 --> 02:22:52,886
Love will create wonders.

2295
02:22:53,097 --> 02:22:55,224
Love is sky.

2296
02:22:55,433 --> 02:22:57,560
Love is patience.

2297
02:22:57,769 --> 02:23:02,570
Isn'tlove a new dawn?
Every heart must love.

2298
02:23:14,986 --> 02:23:17,011
Till now he was my ghost-writer.

2299
02:23:17,989 --> 02:23:21,618
Sathyam is the man who wrote
songs under my name.
