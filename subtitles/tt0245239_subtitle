4
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,544
Who won?

5
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,774
Who lost?

6
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:04,574
- sister in law.
- You?

7
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,544
- I was waiting...
- If brother came back.

8
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:14,308
- Let me breathe in peace.
- You're a good brother.

9
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,539
I'm sorry he's not back yet.

10
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:23,173
Even God does not steal the
happiness of the house in which you live.

11
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:26,147
- you idiot.
- Am I an idiot?

12
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:34,672
You are a blessing to my home.

13
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,907
- What happened to your match?
- I forgot.

14
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,111
We won.

15
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:49,307
- Haven't slept yet?
- I cheated.

16
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,939
Are you playing?

17
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,806
Do you have to grow up to
be a crook like your uncle?

18
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:02,540
- He's very bad.
- Am I a fraud?

19
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:05,010
tell me...

20
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:08,842
- I'm hungry.  Give me dinner.
- Come on, I'll get ready.

21
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,005
We will eat from here.

22
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,579
- You're at meal time.
- Uncle is hungry because he eats

23
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,271
- Can you count?
- Yes.

24
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:25,212
Then count this.
A six off the first ball, then four...

25
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,907
6 more, then 4...

26
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,577
You, feed her.

27
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:04,807
The way you eat is ugly.
Why this emergency?

28
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,640
- I always say, chew food.
- I'm hungry.

29
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:11,441
Brother came.

30
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:33,047
- Why do you stand and eat like this horse?
- I'm very hungry.

31
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,046
- You didn't even change clothes.
- all right.

32
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,002
Do not scold when eating.

33
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:41,113
So, I do not have time to
blame him, he's always eating.

34
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:44,544
- Where are you going?
- With uncle.

35
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,544
Are you not well

36
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,079
Why work so hard?

37
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,347
We do not need extra money.

38
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:16,040
I don't want money either.
I work for you.

39
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,080
I want to give you
all the joys of life.

40
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,808
A good education for Monu and
Sonu to stand on their own two feet.

41
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,510
I want to treat you.

42
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:55,046
- why?
- I wrote to a friend about Sonu.

43
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:59,304
He was informed that he had
a good job with a high salary.

44
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,546
Sonu has a permanent
job with a good salary.

45
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:06,574
- God has heard my prayers.
- Sonu!

46
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:09,307
I wrote to a friend
asking you to find a job.

47
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:12,740
He says you can easily
get this job.  Look at this.

48
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,543
Five hundred rupees a month.

49
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:25,045
You are no longer a child
or a university student.

50
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:28,105
You need to quickly
become a responsible adult.

51
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:33,549
Respect, well-being and
responsibility depend on you.

52
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,077
Now he wants to find a bride.

53
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:39,576
You always jump forward.
Sonu, get ready.

54
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,570
- You have to go to Bombay.
- Are you sending him like that?

55
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:47,204
I mean Bombay, not overseas.

56
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,011
Do not do this job.
I will not let Sonu go.

57
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,976
you are crazy.  You are afraid of everything.

58
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,341
Do not worry.  I am an adult.
I can go alone.

59
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:01,944
I still do not know how
to speak or how to dress.

60
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:06,146
No time to eat or sleep.
When hungry, swallow.

61
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:09,907
- Why are you talking like this?
- Your horse is better than him.

62
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,600
Send that animal anywhere, and
he'll be back home.  Asking for food.

63
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:16,346
But who will take care of this donkey?

64
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,180
He holds a B.A.  Has passed.
First class pass.

65
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,977
He can't find a
good job in Jhansi.

66
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:27,172
- Get ready.  You must leave tomorrow.
- All right.

67
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,143
Want to go shopping?

68
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,506
No.

69
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,043
Where are you going

70
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:37,538
What am I cooking now?

71
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:40,579
- But you just said...
- Can everyone stay hungry?

72
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:44,593
Sonu goes to Bombay.
I have to cook for him.

73
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,373
You are asking nonsense now.

74
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,975
If not, why not send him one?

75
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,546
He cannot be as ignorant as
you.  He holds a B.A.  Has done.

76
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,543
He will be a great officer.

77
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,946
- That's good news.
- better...?  I'm sorry about this.

78
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,574
He is happy about that.

79
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,146
- I lost my ball.
- Always read about the ball.

80
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:09,610
- Go to school.
- Today is a holiday.

81
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,578
Get out of here!

82
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:14,212
- sister in law.
- why?

83
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:17,145
- Get my bags ready.
- Trousers?

84
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,373
Tell your brother.

85
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:29,348
- Why are you late?
- I'm going to Bombay.

86
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,203
- Play cricket?
- No, for a job.

87
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,579
- What kind of job?
- Rs.  500 will be received.

88
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,043
What luck!

89
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,770
Where is Prakash?

90
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:46,611
Tell him the truth.
He is in a bad condition.

91
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,110
He goes to a brothel to drink.

92
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:53,971
- Why didn't you tell me?
- He told us not to come.  You go and scare him.

93
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,077
You need to be afraid,
not me.  Come with me.

94
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:26,675
Is it a good idea to
sneak into a girl's house?

95
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,740
Are you good  This
place is full of alcohol.

96
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,679
Get out!

97
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,271
Are you kidding me?

98
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:42,373
Who told you that?
Do what you love.

99
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:46,540
Do not approach.

100
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,110
Come with me.

101
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:59,339
Oh... she turned you into a man.

102
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,077
Welcome.

103
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:06,180
I will turn your beautiful
smile into a rain of tears.

104
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:12,576
- Shame, you were scared of those guys.
- God, they surrounded me.

105
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,077
- Their work...
- Shut up.

106
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,547
- Find out who that young man is.
- Okay, I'll be right back.

107
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:23,680
My name is useless
unless they are destroyed.

108
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:59,679
- Pay me ten rupees.
- 10 rupees?

109
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:04,045
- That money could go all over Jhansi.
- But this is a bomb.

110
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,907
I will pay you the fee, but
know to speak respectfully.

111
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:12,574
Show some respect.

112
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,548
Now I will be polite.

113
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:40,339
- Who are you looking for?
- Mr. Narain.

114
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,579
- I'm from Jhansi.
- He went to Jhansi today.

115
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,945
- Who?
- Naren's nephew.

116
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,608
He is from Jhansi.

117
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,672
How can we believe
you are Narain's nephew?

118
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,909
- Tell me?
- Give me a testimony.

119
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:06,146
- He's a stranger.
- You shut up.

120
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:09,270
You can not do that, whether
you are a stranger or not.

121
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:13,271
Calm down!  Son.
You stay in a hotel.

122
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,180
Brother, I was told
not to stay in a hotel.

123
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:23,013
Did you go to the
neighbors and rob them?

124
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,212
People have come to deceive.
Let's go inside.

125
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,610
I was told to come at eight, now it is eight-thirty.

126
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,210
Where are you going?

127
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,410
I was the first to come here.
So I'm taking this room.

128
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:51,311
None of you will
get this apartment.

129
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,579
- Who are you?
- The owner of this apartment.

130
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,974
The room you advertised
for has been rented out.

131
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:01,236
You gave me time until eight in the morning.

132
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,738
- Now it's 8.30.
- Sorry.  At 7.45 someone came.

133
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:09,347
It is not fair to bully women.

134
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:12,304
You do not like this room.

135
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:15,270
- Why is that?
- The door is narrow.

136
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:32,079
- Welcome!
- Welcome!  Open the door.

137
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:49,610
I came to buy these rooms.

138
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:53,293
Did you rent it yourself?

139
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:54,905
- Yes.
- Yes...?

140
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,580
My name is Sunil, but my
sister-in-law calls me Sonu.

141
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,720
She said that only the person who loves
me should be called by the name "Sonu".

142
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,110
That might be her joke.

143
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,079
So ma'am, will this
outsider get the room?

144
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:15,647
I have a 2 bedroom apartment.

145
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,712
- You didn't understand that.
- I understand.

146
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:22,612
Even if the rent goes up,
don't worry I'll pay for it on time.

147
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:25,113
- But the problem...
- There can be no problem.

148
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:27,553
I came from Jhansi
for an interview.

149
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,840
- For that good job.
- But I have a problem.

150
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:33,804
Don't worry.  I will fix it.

151
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,803
listen to me.

152
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:38,839
Let's go inside and talk.

153
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,544
- We'll fix it.
- No need.

154
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:45,144
- No...?
- no way.

155
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:48,146
I want to give that room to a girl.

156
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,046
- To a girl?
- Yes.

157
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:52,770
- But you did not advertise like that.
- Maybe.

158
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:54,507
you go.

159
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:01,112
You need to rent a room.
Does it matter to whom?

160
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:04,679
I think that's important.
You can go.

161
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,839
- I'm not going that way.
- How are you going?

162
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:14,079
- Should I call the police?
- No, defeat me by logic.

163
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:21,646
- Then go back 2 steps.
- I can go back four.

164
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:24,644
1, 2.

165
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,610
3 and 4.

166
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:33,442
- Did you get kicked out?
- Who are you?

167
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:37,112
The world calls me a scholar.

168
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,407
- Are you here?
- Yes.

169
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,875
- Do you have a place to stay?
- Yes, but there is no room for breathing.

170
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:46,713
I have a room.  Its wife...

171
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:51,147
... daughter, her husband,
their children and their brother...

172
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:54,145
- And...
- I understand.

173
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:57,627
- Who are you?
- Sunil Kumara.  Came from Jhansi to a job.

174
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:04,513
A letter was brought to Mr. Joglekar.

175
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:08,712
Is your brother Anil Kumara?

176
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:13,110
He works for an insurance company, right?

177
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,773
- Yes.
- I know him well.

178
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:21,511
We met at a poetry meeting.  He was the
only one who appreciated my work that day.

179
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:26,146
Who is this woman?

180
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,739
Like you, she is from a good family.

181
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:34,113
No parents.  Her uncle sent
her to Bombay for education.

182
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,110
He died a few days ago.

183
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:42,841
She has an aunt in Deolali.

184
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:47,112
- Then she's a good girl.
- Yes.

185
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,112
Tell her about me.

186
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:55,147
What is happening?

187
00:17:56,267 --> 00:17:58,873
She does not come forward directly
and there is no complete opposition.

188
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:10,110
- Welcome.
- Who gave you this room?

189
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:14,146
Mr. Craftsman.

190
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:23,113
- Are you his friend's brother?
- Actually a friend of my brother.

191
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:25,613
- His friend...
- How important is that?

192
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:27,610
Let's talk about that.

193
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:32,144
- My sister-in-law says...
- Sorry.

194
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,605
I gave you this room on uncle's
instructions.  So you have to be fine.

195
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,144
The best.

196
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:43,773
I do not like the sound.  Not a
village, this is the city of Bombay.

197
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:47,112
You have to pay special
attention to the rules.

198
00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:51,111
To those who do not know
these, we call them ignorant.

199
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:54,110
Learned about etiquette.

200
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,811
About the rules...

201
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:02,147
This is a bomb, remember it.

202
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:28,008
- what is this?
- Brother sent you butter.

203
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,178
- How is Anil?
- I'm fine.

204
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,820
- His wife?
- She's fine too.

205
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:45,307
It's been 5 years since we met.
We are university friends.

206
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,371
He always talks about you.

207
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:50,610
So, you came to work here.

208
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,604
Do you have a warranty
other than this butter can?

209
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:59,613
Yes, you have a letter from your brother.

210
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,412
Miss Desai is also here.

211
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:06,610
- You come to work tomorrow.
- Good.

212
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,004
I did not have dinner.

213
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:34,810
- Who is that?
- Open the door.

214
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:05,644
If I can get a place here.

215
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,639
what?

216
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,074
Are you on time

217
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,074
You come and cook.

218
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:24,440
You, how can you tell me this?

219
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,075
No...

220
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:34,607
You have to pay the rent.
1, 2, 3... Rs.  5 yrs.

221
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:43,614
This includes rental boarding, right?

222
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:47,680
We also wash your clothes.

223
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,678
- I mean...
- I thought you were innocent.

224
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,677
But now I realize
how cunning you are.

225
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:57,646
You charge extra.

226
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:02,040
- Then you can cook for me too.
- No, I am not your servant.

227
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:05,611
Then eat yourself.

228
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,173
Who is that?

229
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:32,304
- I don't need goals.
- That is not the purpose.

230
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:35,644
I'm just a neighbor.

231
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:38,006
- I do not want to eat.
- Then don't.

232
00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:39,906
Wait a minute.

233
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,214
What did you cook?
I'm just asking this.

234
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:44,973
Potatoes and pumpkin.

235
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:50,407
My sister-in-law told me not
to hurt anyone.  So I will eat.

236
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,680
- No, thank you.
- I will eat to please you.

237
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:04,041
Delicious!

238
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:11,973
Water.

239
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:28,603
Thank you.

240
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,679
- Are you eating like this?
- My sister-in-law always teaches.

241
00:23:33,133 --> 00:23:37,109
But he keeps the water
because I never learn.

242
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:40,146
But no one here is
doing that for you.

243
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:45,645
Sister-in-law, you call me Sonu.

244
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:49,113
- She says...
- Only the one who loves you should call you Sonu.

245
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:52,144
But no one here loves you.

246
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:55,144
Eat and return the plate in the morning.

247
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,179
- Who are the bowlers?
- Shankar and Jaikishan.

248
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,806
- Who is the opening batsman?
- I am.

249
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,136
You...?  You can not even touch the bat.

250
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,474
- But no one else.
- Then we lose.

251
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:25,738
May I say something?

252
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:29,144
Make me the starting batsman.

253
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:32,144
I'm the best batsman on the Jhansi team.

254
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,179
- The team status here is high.
- Give me a chance.

255
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,179
No use.  You get
knocked off the first ball.

256
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:48,813
I'm going to score a century,
otherwise I'm not asking you for a job.

257
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,747
You play then.
Come to Brabourne Stadium tomorrow.

258
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,608
How are you?

259
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,143
- Bring food.
- What do you need?

260
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:28,879
Bring anything made.

261
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,874
What are you eating

262
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:42,177
That's the way it is for kids.

263
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,279
People laugh at you.

264
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,904
My coat may be dirty.

265
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,779
- Is he with you?
- Yes.

266
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,700
- Let's go.
- Don't you want to eat?

267
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,143
No.  Can't you see
everyone is laughing.

268
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,138
- So why?
- You eat.  I'm leaving.

269
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,913
If you promise to feed me
at home, I will not come.

270
00:27:00,134 --> 00:27:02,654
Do you know where
Brabourne Stadium is?

271
00:27:06,534 --> 00:27:08,980
- Why are you going there?
- For a cricket match.

272
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:13,809
- Are you going to see it?
- No, play.

273
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:20,213
- Why are you laughing?
- I mean...

274
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:23,245
Do you play cricket in your village?

275
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,720
You will be amazed at their ability.

276
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,441
Yes, I hear they call
cricket another name.

277
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,303
- is it right?
- What a joke.

278
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:38,109
- Not so.
- So?

279
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,709
Jhansi is not a village but a city.

280
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,679
We have a graduate college,
a sports club, a big factory.

281
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,611
- Sports such as wrestling.
- All right.

282
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,679
Do not be angry.  Do you want
to go to Brabourne Stadium?

283
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:53,211
- I'm going there too.
- Why is that?

284
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,171
I do not like to lie.
I'm going to watch the match too.

285
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,176
- Look at him.
- He looks good.

286
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,940
Looks good but doesn't
work as an athlete.

287
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,510
Nowadays girls come to watch
sports and tell useless stories.

288
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,143
Before you got married,
you must have been like this.

289
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:45,139
- I was not so low.
- What does she want?

290
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,438
Do not count.

291
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,614
The gentleman from Jhansi
looks like he's hitting a century.

292
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,141
Ignorant...

293
00:28:57,833 --> 00:29:00,040
When he hits, the
ball goes over the limit.

294
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:03,676
- You take care.
- Be careful, too.

295
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,178
Shut up.  This is a real match.

296
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:09,039
A real hit.

297
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,676
The enemy is jealous.

298
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:15,271
She has especially
big eyes for that.

299
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,677
They did what they wanted.

300
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,677
He is an ignoramus.
Doesn't look like an athlete.

301
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:36,211
- You can't clap.
- why not?

302
00:30:36,733 --> 00:30:39,942
- Support your own team.
- I support anyone and applaud.

303
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:43,240
- I will clap.
- You can't.  Applaud our man.

304
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,836
Do you know that he is my neighbor?

305
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,780
Another good hit and she
will say, he is my boyfriend.

306
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:08,071
Many people have
come here to meet you.

307
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:12,244
- Are you injured?
- Sprained.

308
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:19,213
- Your scarf
- We live in the same house.

309
00:36:20,334 --> 00:36:22,541
She means I live in her room.

310
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:25,704
That means she has
rented me a room.

311
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:28,211
Bind this.

312
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,205
you idiot.

313
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,743
Ignorant...

314
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:17,005
I like you though.

315
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:23,509
The sister-in-law said that only the
person who loves you should call you Sonu.

316
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:32,374
You know I can call
myself Sonu now?

317
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:45,707
"Where did I go,
where did I land?"

318
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,973
"Where did I go,
where did I land?"

319
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,381
"Someone hit me in the eye"

320
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:59,403
"I had an accident"

321
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:02,646
"Where did I go,
where did I land?"

322
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:07,211
"Where did I go,
where did I land?"

323
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:13,214
"Someone hit me in the eye"

324
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:28,574
"I lost myself"

325
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:33,246
"I'm here but where is my heart?"

326
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:37,938
"I lost myself"

327
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,745
"I'm here but where is my heart?"

328
00:39:43,334 --> 00:39:46,247
"Am I asleep or awake?"

329
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,544
"Am I asleep or awake?"

330
00:40:21,033 --> 00:40:23,946
"Morning is beautiful"

331
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,279
"How can we stay away?"

332
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,279
The morning is beautiful

333
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,847
"How can we stay away?"

334
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:41,246
"Luck looks at me and smiles"

335
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:45,246
"The lucky lady looks
at me and smiles."

336
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:09,843
"She's mine"

337
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:13,677
"My dream has come true"

338
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:18,280
"She's mine"

339
00:41:20,033 --> 00:41:22,536
"My dream has come true"

340
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,240
"The world loves me"

341
00:41:28,367 --> 00:41:31,246
"The world loves me"

342
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,606
Come on.

343
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,609
- I want to...
- Sit down.

344
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:02,040
- Do you want to say something?
- Yes.

345
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:04,244
I am...

346
00:43:05,367 --> 00:43:06,869
I have something important to say.

347
00:43:13,434 --> 00:43:17,678
I think it's time for that.

348
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:19,273
Yes?

349
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,777
I have to go to work now.

350
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,879
I'm sorry, I have to go to the office.

351
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:31,246
- Miss Geetha, ask...
- Yes?

352
00:43:31,867 --> 00:43:33,244
You have to go to work too.

353
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,777
- I...
- Do not try to lie.

354
00:43:49,367 --> 00:43:51,779
I know you went to watch
a cricket match yesterday.

355
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:54,273
Why do you get frequent calls?

356
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,903
- Who is this?
- Sunil.

357
00:44:09,867 --> 00:44:11,744
Mr. Sunil?

358
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,247
To invite you to a dinner
party for our victory...

359
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,947
... Mr. Joglekar wants.

360
00:44:17,434 --> 00:44:19,880
How do I get there?

361
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,870
- Why is that?
- I have an urgent job.

362
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,348
- Then I will not attend either.
- I will come.

363
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,209
- Are you happy now?
- Yes.

364
00:49:58,934 --> 00:50:01,379
I want to look at her
and please my eyes.

365
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,111
I am in love.  But
how do I reveal it?

366
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,111
What if she gets angry?

367
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:15,346
She must be in love too.

368
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,471
Tomorrow I will tell her.

369
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,280
There is no letter from Sonu today.

370
00:50:29,434 --> 00:50:32,040
I wrote to Joglekar.
He replies in a day or two.

371
00:50:33,434 --> 00:50:35,914
My right eye is blinking.

372
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,279
- Take me to Bombay today.
- Are you really crazy?

373
00:50:40,434 --> 00:50:42,004
I will go alone.

374
00:50:44,467 --> 00:50:47,311
I'm going to the city of Bhujwal.
If possible I will go to Bombay.

375
00:50:47,767 --> 00:50:48,973
What a nuisance.

376
00:50:51,934 --> 00:50:54,813
- why?
- Brother Sunil, I am going to Bombay by train today.

377
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,174
Good.

378
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,177
- Why is this?
- A fraudster bothered me.

379
00:51:39,934 --> 00:51:42,813
Don't worry.  I will
inform the police.

380
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:48,911
I come from a good family.  If that
happened then my name would be ruined.

381
00:51:51,467 --> 00:51:53,344
No excuses are needed.

382
00:51:54,434 --> 00:51:56,311
You are hired today.

383
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:05,870
Your brother and his
wife will be very happy.

384
00:52:06,433 --> 00:52:07,935
Wish them well.

385
00:52:09,033 --> 00:52:10,937
- Listen...
- Yes?

386
00:52:11,433 --> 00:52:13,937
You go back to Jhansi tomorrow.

387
00:52:15,434 --> 00:52:16,879
- Sorry...?
- Yes.

388
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:20,313
You've been in charge of the
Jhansi Agency since day one.

389
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,380
Why is this a problem?

390
00:52:46,934 --> 00:52:51,013
- No.
- Something has happened.

391
00:52:59,967 --> 00:53:03,210
I suspected you
would not get this job.

392
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:07,311
This is your appointment letter.

393
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:13,608
You got the job,
why are you sad?

394
00:53:13,934 --> 00:53:19,475
No worries, but I have to take
the morning train back to Jhansi.

395
00:53:19,933 --> 00:53:22,812
- Tomorrow morning?
- Yes.

396
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,472
I received the letter.

397
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:31,343
Like you, I received a letter.

398
00:53:32,467 --> 00:53:37,041
Your name is an appointment.
My name is Despair.

399
00:53:37,434 --> 00:53:40,313
- You mean?
- I was fired.

400
00:53:42,434 --> 00:53:43,708
They do not want me.

401
00:53:48,834 --> 00:53:51,280
So... what do you do now?

402
00:53:55,467 --> 00:53:57,572
I'm going back to Auntie.

403
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:03,937
- when?
- Tomorrow morning.

404
00:54:05,467 --> 00:54:08,744
Deolali is on the road to
Jhansi so we can go together.

405
00:54:09,467 --> 00:54:10,810
That's good news.

406
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:20,575
I'm sorry to lose your job.

407
00:54:34,467 --> 00:54:39,917
Now close to Deolali.
We will never meet again.

408
00:54:42,467 --> 00:54:45,710
Last chance I get to
tell you what I want.

409
00:54:47,434 --> 00:54:54,318
I want to look at this
beautiful view and eyes.

410
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:56,279
I want to say I love you.

411
00:55:01,433 --> 00:55:05,313
Would you like to marry me?

412
00:55:23,434 --> 00:55:25,038
Now close to Deolali.

413
00:55:25,467 --> 00:55:27,310
We will never meet again.

414
00:55:27,967 --> 00:55:30,345
Last chance I get to
tell you what I want.

415
00:55:30,967 --> 00:55:33,948
I want to see this
beautiful view and eyes.

416
00:55:35,467 --> 00:55:38,346
- Yes?
- I have to say.

417
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,377
- I'm hungry.
- what?

418
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,306
- what is the matter?
- I have to get off.

419
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,906
- Why is that?

420
00:56:13,034 --> 00:56:15,844
- We reached Deolali.
- Is this Deolali?

421
00:56:16,467 --> 00:56:19,346
But I have a lot to tell you.

422
00:56:20,467 --> 00:56:23,937
- you are very beautiful.
- Thank you.

423
00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:28,313
- I will miss you.
- thank you.

424
00:56:29,434 --> 00:56:33,746
I just wanted to tell you
that you are so beautiful.

425
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:38,643
- I will miss you.
- You said that before.  Welcome!

426
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,945
I will write to you.

427
00:56:55,467 --> 00:56:59,677
- Geetha.
- Yes, it's me.

428
00:57:01,467 --> 00:57:03,037
- Where is Auntie?
- Praying.

429
00:57:41,434 --> 00:57:44,142
God bless.  When did you come

430
00:57:44,634 --> 00:57:45,840
just now.

431
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:50,844
You make beautiful statues.

432
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,277
She looks really old.

433
00:57:58,967 --> 00:58:02,176
- Is her hair real?
- No, painted white.

434
00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:09,407
Also, this time you
make me a pair of dolls.

435
00:58:09,934 --> 00:58:13,814
- Dolls?
- Yes, you made them when I was a kid.

436
00:58:15,467 --> 00:58:20,541
Those days are gone.  Now
God will give you a real doll.

437
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,674
- Geetha.
- why?

438
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:35,348
Someone called Sunil
wants to meet his aunt.

439
00:58:41,467 --> 00:58:45,313
Take him to the living room.
Tell Auntie to come back in a little while.

440
00:58:45,867 --> 00:58:47,312
- All right.
- hurry up.

441
00:59:18,434 --> 00:59:21,972
- good day.
- Welcome, son.

442
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:25,013
- Sit down.
- I am...

443
00:59:25,133 --> 00:59:26,313
all right.

444
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,144
- My love...?
- Tell the truth.

445
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,137
You don't know me
but Geeta knows me.

446
00:59:47,267 --> 00:59:49,144
I was renting her
house in Bombay.

447
00:59:51,267 --> 00:59:52,610
is it.

448
00:59:54,267 --> 00:59:58,477
I come from a good family.  B,
a.  Passed.  Doing a good job.

449
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,474
- What do you want now?
- I want the anthem.

450
01:00:06,967 --> 01:00:08,139
I want to tie the knot.

451
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,838
- Say it again.
- I want to tie the knot.

452
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,613
- Marry Geetha...
- You're a joker.

453
01:00:17,933 --> 01:00:21,881
We do not know who you
are, would you like her?

454
01:00:22,767 --> 01:00:25,145
- Geetha knows me.
- What does she know?

455
01:00:26,267 --> 01:00:29,146
Is it just that you are handsome?
But what is in your heart?

456
01:00:29,934 --> 01:00:32,471
I swear I have no evil
in my heart.  I love her.

457
01:00:32,967 --> 01:00:34,844
I do not believe you.

458
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,543
You do not accept our joining?

459
01:00:39,967 --> 01:00:43,176
- No.
- Then listen to my decision.

460
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:48,180
I have to tie the
Gita or drink poison.

461
01:00:49,267 --> 01:00:51,144
My body will be near this house.

462
01:00:52,934 --> 01:00:57,144
do not say that.  Don't you
know that you are my life?

463
01:00:57,967 --> 01:00:59,878
I can not live without you.

464
01:01:00,567 --> 01:01:02,843
No one can separate us.

465
01:01:03,667 --> 01:01:06,147
- what are you saying?
- Our love, brought us here.

466
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:12,479
We leave the world for our love.

467
01:01:12,634 --> 01:01:14,978
- Leave me first.
- Now we're one.

468
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,179
- Our soul is one.
- What is this?

469
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,646
I often told you not to worry.

470
01:05:34,267 --> 01:05:36,304
How can I not be upset?

471
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:38,678
Geetha is sad.

472
01:05:40,834 --> 01:05:44,111
No, she is more sensitive than we are

473
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:47,710
She weighs her decision carefully.

474
01:05:49,834 --> 01:05:53,680
Champa give this
medicine every two hours.

475
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,670
I am leaving now.  Let me know.

476
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,973
- May I have the syrup?
- Keep it.

477
01:06:04,767 --> 01:06:06,678
Where are those two?

478
01:06:07,367 --> 01:06:10,678
- They just arrived
- What are they doing?

479
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:14,678
They are afraid to come in.

480
01:06:15,334 --> 01:06:17,314
I'll go out and see.

481
01:06:22,834 --> 01:06:25,178
We have to go
inside to talk about it.

482
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,337
- I do not have the courage.
- But she's your aunt.

483
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:38,048
That is the problem.  I could have
talked to your aunt without fear.

484
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,303
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?

485
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,800
I will tell your aunt first.
Then my brother and his wife.

486
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,075
- Am I getting married alone?
- Indeed.

487
01:06:47,867 --> 01:06:50,313
- I do not want a marriage.
- I don't want to either.

488
01:06:53,167 --> 01:06:55,443
- Then why are you here?
- I made a mistake.

489
01:06:55,834 --> 01:06:58,713
- Where are you going?
- Have a nice day Auntie.

490
01:06:59,834 --> 01:07:01,677
Why is this?

491
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,939
- who is he?
- I do not know.

492
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:11,647
- What is he doing here?
- God knows that.

493
01:07:12,867 --> 01:07:15,677
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

494
01:07:16,267 --> 01:07:19,680
He has already done damage.

495
01:07:20,867 --> 01:07:24,713
There is no shame or
protection of family honor.

496
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:27,711
This is a bad time.
So there is no shame.

497
01:07:28,834 --> 01:07:32,714
- We...
- Shut up!  You will get your work back.

498
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,680
- Sorry!
- I'll write everything to your brother.

499
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,677
You have to honor his name.

500
01:07:41,067 --> 01:07:44,173
- You insulted me.
- what?  That is not true.

501
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:50,649
- Brother will be angry.
- You will never forget this.

502
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:54,212
Aunt, I'm wrong too.

503
01:07:54,867 --> 01:07:58,246
You will both be punished.

504
01:07:58,834 --> 01:08:03,715
- You can't stay in my house.
- Where should I go?

505
01:08:04,234 --> 01:08:05,713
To your beloved home.

506
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,677
I have to marry you two.

507
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:16,340
Aunt, you are an angel.
I will never forget this.

508
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:20,646
You have done me a favor.
I was very upset.

509
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:25,338
Geetha needs to find a good husband.

510
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:30,339
I would love to see Geeta dressed
up as a bride before she dies.

511
01:08:30,867 --> 01:08:36,715
God is watching over you.
We will not let you die.

512
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:38,373
Bad boy!

513
01:08:41,334 --> 01:08:44,679
This must have been
January last year.

514
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,180
If not January, it's February.

515
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:52,281
I went to Baranas.  I had to go there.

516
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,638
Why did I have to go?
Because I had to go to Allahabad.

517
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:00,340
Thought to go to the temple.

518
01:09:02,867 --> 01:09:05,211
- I met a sage.
- It's ten o'clock.

519
01:09:06,834 --> 01:09:09,713
- It's time for you to go to bed.
- I don't have time for that.

520
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,109
I can talk even at night.

521
01:09:12,834 --> 01:09:15,711
All night.  All I
need is a listener.

522
01:09:15,834 --> 01:09:18,440
- So what did I say?
- You went to Baranas...

523
01:09:20,267 --> 01:09:22,338
You know there are
three types of sages.

524
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,274
Yes, I know that.

525
01:09:26,801 --> 01:09:29,680
Anyway these guys...
where are you going?

526
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:35,711
I'm sleepy.  He has to prepare
his breakfast to leave tomorrow.

527
01:09:36,201 --> 01:09:38,681
Okay, go.

528
01:09:39,834 --> 01:09:42,713
Why are you standing?
Don't want to sit with me?

529
01:09:43,834 --> 01:09:45,711
- There is no such thing.
- Then sit down.

530
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:50,043
It's a very interesting story.
What did I say?

531
01:09:50,434 --> 01:09:53,054
You went to Varanasi
and met a sage.

532
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,680
He looked at me and said...

533
01:09:58,467 --> 01:10:00,879
... that God hears your prayers
and that your wish will come true.

534
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,711
But to make it come true...

535
01:10:26,834 --> 01:10:30,714
"Dear moon, go
slowly across the sky"

536
01:10:32,267 --> 01:10:35,976
"Dear moon, go
slowly across the sky"

537
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:41,680
"Dear moon, go
slowly across the sky"

538
01:10:48,867 --> 01:10:52,405
"Do not break my
dream after the night"

539
01:10:53,867 --> 01:10:59,146
"Dear moon, go
slowly across the sky"

540
01:10:59,867 --> 01:11:03,474
"Do not break my
dream after the night"

541
01:11:04,234 --> 01:11:09,115
"Dear moon, go
slowly across the sky"

542
01:11:26,867 --> 01:11:29,746
"The sight you see
runs through my heart"

543
01:11:31,867 --> 01:11:35,474
"The look on your
face hurts sweetly"

544
01:11:37,834 --> 01:11:40,713
"The sight you see
runs through my heart"

545
01:11:42,234 --> 01:11:46,705
"The look on your
face hurts sweetly"

546
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:52,671
"A gentle breeze is blowing."

547
01:11:53,834 --> 01:11:57,714
"Dear moon, go
slowly across the sky"

548
01:12:24,334 --> 01:12:28,180
"What I saw with your own eyes"

549
01:12:30,367 --> 01:12:33,780
"The result was that I
had to close my eyes."

550
01:12:35,701 --> 01:12:38,705
"What I saw drinking from your eyes"

551
01:12:40,834 --> 01:12:45,214
"The result was that I
had to close my eyes."

552
01:12:46,334 --> 01:12:50,544
"We have millions of
things to talk about tonight."

553
01:13:24,334 --> 01:13:27,611
"Two hearts together
light a hundred lamps"

554
01:13:29,767 --> 01:13:33,180
"A million flowers have
blossomed for me because of you"

555
01:13:35,367 --> 01:13:38,473
"Two hearts together
light a hundred lamps"

556
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:44,871
"A million flowers have
blossomed for me because of you"

557
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:50,512
"The sky is raining love"

558
01:14:53,867 --> 01:15:00,409
- How is she?
- It touched her heart.

559
01:15:01,867 --> 01:15:05,212
If she lives 24 hours,
she can survive.

560
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:07,313
- Can I go in?
- Yes.

561
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,706
No need to worry.

562
01:15:11,867 --> 01:15:15,679
I have one wish.  Do you do it?

563
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,246
I want Geeta to marry you.

564
01:15:25,367 --> 01:15:28,644
Now, right now.

565
01:15:30,367 --> 01:15:34,782
My only wish is to see
Geeta dressed as a bride.

566
01:15:35,367 --> 01:15:40,715
We will not let you die
until God protects you.

567
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,243
Accept my advice
and let her stay here.

568
01:15:59,367 --> 01:16:05,249
- She can join me later.
- No, the groom cannot go alone.

569
01:16:05,767 --> 01:16:07,906
- Who will take care of you?
- Me too...?

570
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:11,203
- These people are here.
- But...

571
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:17,215
I just lived to see your groom
get married and take you away.

572
01:16:19,334 --> 01:16:23,180
Bring Sunil back
here if you can.

573
01:16:25,367 --> 01:16:27,278
God bless you!

574
01:16:55,067 --> 01:16:57,172
- Did you think this?
- what?

575
01:16:57,967 --> 01:16:59,844
How do you tell your
brother the news?

576
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:03,077
- What is it?
- marriage

577
01:17:03,101 --> 01:17:07,904
- Whose marriage?
- Yes, our marriage.  what is the problem?

578
01:17:08,867 --> 01:17:10,244
Will they be angry?

579
01:17:12,367 --> 01:17:17,749
- Why should they be angry?
- I mean... will everything be alright?

580
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:20,608
- Will it be a nuisance?
- no way.

581
01:17:21,367 --> 01:17:23,210
- So what do you think?
- I am...?

582
01:17:25,367 --> 01:17:27,813
I was waiting to see
how beautiful the sky was.

583
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:33,849
Amazing!  Look at that mountain and the vines.

584
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:37,280
That mountain is lost in thoughts.

585
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,274
I think so...

586
01:17:59,334 --> 01:18:05,250
My brother is a good man.

587
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,711
- how do you mean?
- Nothing.

588
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:15,144
The reason is...

589
01:18:16,367 --> 01:18:19,576
- Cause is...
- Cause is... Cause is...

590
01:18:20,367 --> 01:18:23,246
It's this or that.
So what is it?

591
01:18:23,967 --> 01:18:27,972
Brother is angry.
He can hit me.

592
01:18:32,701 --> 01:18:34,203
Will he hit a young man?

593
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:37,642
He doesn't think I'm big.
To him I was a small child.

594
01:18:40,401 --> 01:18:43,905
You should have
told me not to come.

595
01:18:44,401 --> 01:18:47,780
do not be afraid.
I have an idea.

596
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,243
You go to our house alone.

597
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,737
- I'll come back later.
- Ask...

598
01:18:53,367 --> 01:18:54,903
I'll come back later.

599
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:58,238
What do I do?

600
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,006
- Who do you want to meet?
- All of you.

601
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:18,777
- U.S...?
- Yes, Ramu.

602
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:22,973
- Do you know me?
- Is your asthma good?

603
01:19:23,067 --> 01:19:25,509
- I brought you
medicine from the bomb.

604
01:19:25,567 --> 01:19:27,909
From Bombay...?  That's where Sunil is.

605
01:19:28,367 --> 01:19:29,846
- He sent me here.
- he...?

606
01:19:31,367 --> 01:19:35,213
- I hear he's an officer.
- Yes.

607
01:19:36,734 --> 01:19:38,805
- Then take my luggage.
- All right.

608
01:19:59,867 --> 01:20:06,148
Who are you  It seems that
Goddess Lakshmi has come here.

609
01:20:06,867 --> 01:20:08,710
I'll get you a drink.

610
01:20:16,234 --> 01:20:19,681
- Here...
- My curiosity is piqued.

611
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:23,110
It will not diminish until
you know who you are.

612
01:20:24,234 --> 01:20:26,441
You look like a sister to me.

613
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,277
- But you...
- I'm a junior.

614
01:20:33,367 --> 01:20:38,248
I belong to the same caste.
I can't take my husband's name.

615
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,244
Can't you take his name?

616
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:49,246
I thought girls today would
consider this stupidity.

617
01:20:50,434 --> 01:20:52,880
People have forgotten
respect and tradition.

618
01:20:54,801 --> 01:20:56,246
- Did you come alone?
- Yes.

619
01:20:57,801 --> 01:21:00,941
He is busy.

620
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,277
- Where did you come from?
- From the bomb.

621
01:21:03,801 --> 01:21:05,747
Our son is there.

622
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,637
- That's my cousin.
- He's the one who sent me here.

623
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:13,980
He sent you too, how is he now?

624
01:21:14,367 --> 01:21:17,541
He is fine.  But day and
night he says the same thing.

625
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,838
My sister-in-law is the best.
All the other girls are pale.

626
01:21:23,401 --> 01:21:25,677
She cooks very well,
it's a lucky good house.

627
01:21:26,434 --> 01:21:28,277
She is an angel.

628
01:21:28,867 --> 01:21:32,610
Anyone who touches
her feet will be blessed.

629
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,938
So I went to your shelter.

630
01:21:39,401 --> 01:21:42,245
He loves me so much.

631
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:49,645
I thought so too.  I have
never seen such love.

632
01:21:51,134 --> 01:21:53,808
The peace and love
here is only in the temples.

633
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,277
You, too, speak like him.

634
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,176
- Sit down.
- I'll sit here.

635
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:12,176
How does he eat?

636
01:22:13,234 --> 01:22:16,738
Yes, only if someone is
holding a glass of water.

637
01:22:17,867 --> 01:22:22,111
If you blame him, he
says he's eating like this.

638
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:27,713
He's still stupid.

639
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:31,471
- Listen to this!
- I'll be back.

640
01:23:05,934 --> 01:23:08,380
- What's the news?
- A little bit right.

641
01:23:08,667 --> 01:23:11,170
Did you tell them
we were married?

642
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:15,107
What about our marriage?
Who told you that?

643
01:23:15,567 --> 01:23:17,907
Stop making jokes.
Did you tell them?

644
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:22,347
I just said I was married.

645
01:23:23,867 --> 01:23:30,751
calm down.  I said I was
married but never told anyone.

646
01:23:31,934 --> 01:23:33,777
Like you're putting me in trouble.

647
01:23:36,934 --> 01:23:39,312
Mom, Uncle are back.

648
01:23:39,934 --> 01:23:42,813
Is this for me?  Uncle is back.

649
01:23:46,901 --> 01:23:49,177
Sonu.  When did you come
Why did you not inform us?

650
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:51,781
- Where is brother?
- Upstairs.  He's coming down.

651
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:55,777
- Come here.
- What's the matter?

652
01:23:56,234 --> 01:23:59,738
- Why are you scared?
- I have...?

653
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:03,409
- Promise you'll not go crazy.
- Are you trying to kill me?

654
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:06,176
Did you quit that job?
You just joined it.

655
01:24:06,934 --> 01:24:09,778
- No, I did not leave.
- So you committed a crime?

656
01:24:10,934 --> 01:24:14,814
No.  Promise you
will not go crazy.

657
01:24:15,934 --> 01:24:20,508
- No.  Tell me now.
- I got married.

658
01:24:23,401 --> 01:24:27,508
Are you married, without telling us?

659
01:24:27,901 --> 01:24:30,438
Why did you hide something
so important from us?

660
01:24:30,901 --> 01:24:32,778
- How did you do that?
- Brother came.

661
01:24:34,867 --> 01:24:39,475
Long live you!
Why is she crying?

662
01:24:39,934 --> 01:24:43,780
I'm back.
Why are you crying now?

663
01:24:44,134 --> 01:24:46,870
You said you
weren't going crazy.

664
01:24:46,934 --> 01:24:50,575
You do not have the courage to bring her
home.  So I'm sure something went wrong.

665
01:24:50,934 --> 01:24:53,437
- What caste is she?
- Really...

666
01:24:53,901 --> 01:24:56,780
In a lower caste?  I knew
you would do such a thing.

667
01:24:57,167 --> 01:24:59,545
- what is the matter?
- Your brother is married for love.

668
01:24:59,901 --> 01:25:02,438
I don't even know how
to eat.  But married.

669
01:25:03,301 --> 01:25:04,746
Who is that?

670
01:25:06,867 --> 01:25:08,744
be happy.

671
01:25:13,934 --> 01:25:15,311
I will not do that again.

672
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,878
Not again.  Does one get married
ten times?  Coming here, idiot.

673
01:25:25,334 --> 01:25:29,043
You are no longer an idiot.
The first time you did the right thing.

674
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,379
I am very happy.

675
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:37,780
Bride, you have a difficult task.

676
01:25:38,367 --> 01:25:41,473
- Can you do that?
- I will try.

677
01:25:41,901 --> 01:25:43,778
You have to turn this
monkey into a human.

678
01:25:46,334 --> 01:25:48,780
I invite neighbors
over for dinner.

679
01:26:25,034 --> 01:26:28,914
"Hearts met and both were upset"

680
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:33,314
"Have a romantic marriage
when you lose patience"

681
01:26:34,167 --> 01:26:35,305
"I got married first"

682
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,540
"Hearts met and both were upset"

683
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:44,007
"Have a romantic marriage
when you lose patience"

684
01:27:08,434 --> 01:27:12,280
"He was the bird of the north
and she was the bird of the south."

685
01:27:17,401 --> 01:27:18,880
"He was the bird of the north."

686
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:21,277
"She was the bird of the South."

687
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,279
"Once their eyes met in a park"

688
01:27:26,434 --> 01:27:29,779
"Once their eyes met in a park"

689
01:27:33,467 --> 01:27:37,040
"They gave hearts
but later repented"

690
01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:20,281
"How long can he lie and
talk to the stars in the sky?"

691
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:29,271
"How long can he lie and
talk to the stars in the sky?"

692
01:28:30,434 --> 01:28:33,972
"How to Avoid Sleep Eyes"

693
01:28:34,834 --> 01:28:38,247
"How to Avoid Sleep Eyes"

694
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:45,646
"Family members are ashamed and outsiders are scared"

695
01:29:38,467 --> 01:29:40,879
So this is why you
got married suddenly.

696
01:29:41,434 --> 01:29:44,881
- How are you now, sister-in-law?
- Good now.

697
01:29:45,967 --> 01:29:47,844
We get up.  There is a lot of work.

698
01:29:48,367 --> 01:29:50,779
I need to heat the milk,
to make Sonu's breakfast.

699
01:29:52,401 --> 01:29:54,813
You are so happy
to work for the family.

700
01:29:56,467 --> 01:30:00,540
Bless me too, I too want
to serve the family happily.

701
01:30:00,934 --> 01:30:03,778
I will work for you too.

702
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:05,779
You will have to do all the work.

703
01:30:07,934 --> 01:30:10,505
- Let's go, there's a lot of work
- Okay.

704
01:30:11,967 --> 01:30:14,811
You are at rest now.
I will do all the work.

705
01:31:42,434 --> 01:31:45,278
If you die, I will die too.

706
01:31:47,434 --> 01:31:49,937
Are you dying

707
01:31:50,467 --> 01:31:53,314
- For whom?
- I'm not saying.

708
01:31:53,467 --> 01:31:55,314
I will die for you.

709
01:32:04,967 --> 01:32:07,811
See you in the evening.  I'll come before six

710
01:32:08,267 --> 01:32:09,541
Leave Auntie's hand.

711
01:32:28,467 --> 01:32:30,845
- Is this watch stopped?
- No.

712
01:32:31,467 --> 01:32:34,812
- Why is it not moving?
- Because of three o'clock.

713
01:32:36,467 --> 01:32:38,845
- What time is it five o'clock in the evening?
- When the hour hand is on five.

714
01:32:47,434 --> 01:32:49,744
I want to ask you
something important.

715
01:32:51,401 --> 01:32:55,315
- What is it?
- Do you want to sleep during the day?

716
01:32:55,934 --> 01:32:59,006
- Do you know what women say?
- what?

717
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,812
Your sister has been married for ten years.

718
01:33:03,967 --> 01:33:05,844
Even now the two are always together.

719
01:33:06,967 --> 01:33:09,311
That's right.  Have you
ever been to your home?

720
01:33:09,934 --> 01:33:15,316
Even if my brother goes to work,
he's worried about losing you again.

721
01:33:16,934 --> 01:33:20,814
Why only me?
Your husband is also a good person.

722
01:33:21,334 --> 01:33:24,807
Your son loves you.

723
01:33:30,667 --> 01:33:33,511
Love?  He always makes
faces like a monkey.

724
01:33:33,967 --> 01:33:37,144
Love is like flying
out the window.

725
01:33:41,867 --> 01:33:45,013
- why?
- I have a sore throat.

726
01:33:57,967 --> 01:33:59,844
Sister, send me a glass of water.

727
01:34:00,967 --> 01:34:02,844
Sonu has arrived.

728
01:34:06,001 --> 01:34:09,175
- Tell Ramu.
- He went to the market.

729
01:34:09,967 --> 01:34:16,178
- you go.
- I... No he told you, you go.

730
01:34:16,467 --> 01:34:18,743
I will go.  Stupid girl.

731
01:34:19,467 --> 01:34:22,641
He asks for water, go.

732
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:24,306
I am not going.

733
01:35:02,467 --> 01:35:03,707
Here is the water.

734
01:35:06,467 --> 01:35:09,676
- Who is that?
- I'll show you.

735
01:35:19,967 --> 01:35:21,344
You are very talented.

736
01:35:22,467 --> 01:35:25,346
I did this to trap you.

737
01:35:26,467 --> 01:35:28,267
What did you complain
to my sister-in-law?

738
01:35:28,334 --> 01:35:29,711
Am I a monkey?

739
01:35:30,467 --> 01:35:32,970
- Is love missing?
- let go.  Sister is awake.

740
01:35:33,467 --> 01:35:37,074
- This is not a sin.
- Do you know what adults say?

741
01:35:38,967 --> 01:35:44,474
Forget them.  They
forget their time.

742
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,880
I mean, is everyone like you?

743
01:35:50,967 --> 01:35:54,847
How can I tell you?

744
01:35:56,967 --> 01:35:58,344
I want to turn this into night.

745
01:36:10,434 --> 01:36:13,972
"This beautiful
night sings for us"

746
01:36:15,467 --> 01:36:18,004
"This beautiful
night sings for us"

747
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:26,815
Tell me the sweet
story of last night

748
01:36:28,967 --> 01:36:31,573
"This beautiful
night sings for us"

749
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:40,215
"Tell me the sweet
story of last night"

750
01:37:00,967 --> 01:37:04,346
"It breaks my heart to hear that."

751
01:37:09,467 --> 01:37:12,641
"It breaks my heart to hear that."

752
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:16,972
"And I lost the mask on my head."

753
01:37:18,501 --> 01:37:21,380
"The magic of the night revolved"

754
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:25,777
"To bring glory to the dawn"

755
01:38:06,467 --> 01:38:10,347
"Meaningful Silences"

756
01:38:15,467 --> 01:38:18,641
"Meaningful Silences"

757
01:38:19,934 --> 01:38:23,108
"For me, I'm looking forward to losing myself."

758
01:38:23,834 --> 01:38:27,281
"I dream"

759
01:38:28,501 --> 01:38:31,380
"Half awake, half asleep"

760
01:39:09,734 --> 01:39:12,874
"My heart and mind belong to you"

761
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,574
"My heart and mind belong to you"

762
01:39:22,967 --> 01:39:25,846
"My world is glorious
because of you, my love"

763
01:39:26,967 --> 01:39:30,540
"Everywhere in my
body I say your name"

764
01:39:31,001 --> 01:39:34,505
"We will never be apart"

765
01:39:59,501 --> 01:40:01,708
Your brother forgot his lunch.

766
01:40:02,101 --> 01:40:04,012
If he eats outside, his
health will deteriorate.

767
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:05,860
I'm going that way.
I'll give it to him.

768
01:40:10,534 --> 01:40:13,378
Tell him I put
the muffler on top.

769
01:40:13,501 --> 01:40:16,880
- Give it to him.
- Really?

770
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,536
Or wrap around the neck?

771
01:40:25,634 --> 01:40:28,843
- What's the emergency?
- I'm going to the train station.

772
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:33,077
- I can miss my brother's train.
- He went to this house.

773
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,776
- What did you say?
- Just left.

774
01:40:40,534 --> 01:40:42,104
What is he doing there?

775
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:57,075
I keep wondering
whose eyes are on me.

776
01:40:57,467 --> 01:41:00,380
You came and made me happy.

777
01:41:02,967 --> 01:41:04,344
Try to understand me.

778
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:11,415
You are the most beautiful and
the biggest weakness of my life.

779
01:41:12,268 --> 01:41:15,147
You only come three
days a month, but big talk.

780
01:41:17,034 --> 01:41:20,379
You do not know how I
can find these three days.

781
01:41:21,501 --> 01:41:25,108
- If anyone sees me...
- I do not want to hear this.

782
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:29,344
I do not know why
I'm always scared.

783
01:41:30,467 --> 01:41:32,344
Sir, let the time come.

784
01:41:33,467 --> 01:41:37,347
Then you will see how I
hide you from the world.

785
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:44,140
- who is this?
- My younger brother.

786
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,377
What is lacking in your wife?

787
01:42:04,467 --> 01:42:10,008
You do not know.  Sometimes man is
deceived even though he does not like it.

788
01:42:11,534 --> 01:42:14,981
It is not a cause for weakness.

789
01:42:15,301 --> 01:42:19,374
To all of us you are an
angel not just a human being.

790
01:42:21,534 --> 01:42:24,413
We were happy in our world.

791
01:42:24,867 --> 01:42:26,107
Why do you want to destroy it?

792
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:33,382
Sometimes man cannot
think of good or sorrow.

793
01:42:34,767 --> 01:42:36,940
My head is heavy with shame.

794
01:42:38,467 --> 01:42:41,380
I once felt ashamed
in this house.

795
01:42:42,467 --> 01:42:44,947
Today shamelessness
strikes me a hundred times.

796
01:42:45,267 --> 01:42:47,770
What sin did your wife
commit to break our temple?

797
01:42:48,501 --> 01:42:51,038
If she sees this form of her
god, she will drink poison.

798
01:42:51,534 --> 01:42:53,810
No.

799
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:02,037
Let's go home.  For me

800
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:05,379
For your wife.  For your son.

801
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:12,073
I swear my body will
be here if you do not go.

802
01:43:12,467 --> 01:43:15,346
do not say that.

803
01:43:17,167 --> 01:43:19,340
Your brother is not a good person.
Let him be alone.

804
01:43:24,034 --> 01:43:25,411
How can I leave you?

805
01:43:29,034 --> 01:43:30,911
There is nothing in that house without you.

806
01:43:31,367 --> 01:43:32,573
We will all be orphans.

807
01:43:33,034 --> 01:43:35,310
I know how big a
responsibility that is

808
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,207
Our family happiness
depends on it.

809
01:43:39,434 --> 01:43:42,677
I sacrifice everything
to save her from trauma.

810
01:43:43,167 --> 01:43:49,118
Because she is not only your
wife but she is also my mother.

811
01:43:53,034 --> 01:43:54,308
my brother...

812
01:43:58,034 --> 01:43:59,911
I always thought you were innocent.

813
01:44:01,034 --> 01:44:02,536
You saved me today.

814
01:44:04,034 --> 01:44:05,604
You saved our family.

815
01:44:07,034 --> 01:44:08,877
For me, I'm proud of my brother.

816
01:44:10,001 --> 01:44:13,539
I will never come here.
I will never leave home like this.

817
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,377
Never.

818
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,877
Let's go home, not inside.

819
01:44:21,567 --> 01:44:22,875
I'll fix it.

820
01:44:26,034 --> 01:44:28,446
Do not argue with anyone.
Come home quietly.

821
01:44:36,534 --> 01:44:38,411
Miss, come a little.

822
01:44:44,501 --> 01:44:48,381
listen to me.  You
have to help me.

823
01:44:50,501 --> 01:44:52,981
- No one should know that.
- Are you here?

824
01:44:53,467 --> 01:44:54,844
Am I here...?

825
01:44:56,134 --> 01:44:58,474
I feel like squeezing your neck.

826
01:44:58,534 --> 01:45:01,071
I'm not lucky enough
to die at your hands.

827
01:45:03,567 --> 01:45:06,510
What do you lose if
your family is happy?

828
01:45:07,267 --> 01:45:12,148
Don't let anyone know
your brother came here.

829
01:45:13,267 --> 01:45:15,372
- Got it?
- Yes.

830
01:45:16,501 --> 01:45:18,037
What do I get back for that?

831
01:45:19,501 --> 01:45:20,878
I'm so stupid.

832
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:24,972
I forgot the desire for money.

833
01:45:26,534 --> 01:45:29,071
Here is the fee to
cover your beautiful lips.

834
01:45:31,534 --> 01:45:32,979
You are very handsome.

835
01:45:33,934 --> 01:45:36,380
These are just plain pieces of paper.

836
01:45:37,567 --> 01:45:39,410
How do you expect
me to accept these?

837
01:45:41,967 --> 01:45:47,076
What would you say
if I said I love you?

838
01:45:49,534 --> 01:45:51,138
Your love is so cheap.

839
01:45:51,501 --> 01:45:57,383
- It changes from day to day.
- No, this is the second day.

840
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:01,106
You play this game because of money.

841
01:46:02,501 --> 01:46:04,412
I will send more.  do you agree?

842
01:46:05,534 --> 01:46:07,411
I accept everything you say.

843
01:46:08,534 --> 01:46:09,808
Good.

844
01:46:11,167 --> 01:46:15,411
Do not go.  I also
have a small condition.

845
01:46:16,534 --> 01:46:19,413
- What is it?
- You have to come here every day

846
01:46:20,534 --> 01:46:22,673
I... I come to you...?

847
01:46:23,534 --> 01:46:26,777
- I hate everything here.
- I love everything else.

848
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,036
There is nothing wrong with either.

849
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:33,379
Give me a minute.

850
01:46:40,567 --> 01:46:42,046
Your brother left this.

851
01:46:42,067 --> 01:46:45,344
Take one of his and bring a
photo of yourself tomorrow.

852
01:46:49,034 --> 01:46:51,913
I will definitely be locked up.

853
01:47:07,067 --> 01:47:11,880
I destroyed the marks
of my brother's sin.

854
01:47:13,034 --> 01:47:14,945
You can not hurt us.

855
01:47:16,567 --> 01:47:18,843
Your childhood stole my heart

856
01:47:20,534 --> 01:47:22,411
Anyone will like
this simplicity.

857
01:47:22,967 --> 01:47:25,072
He fights but has
no sword in his hand.

858
01:47:27,534 --> 01:47:30,879
I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow evening.

859
01:47:31,501 --> 01:47:35,381
Or make and distribute a
lot of negative pictures here

860
01:47:36,501 --> 01:47:38,412
I'll send one to your sister - in - law.

861
01:47:47,567 --> 01:47:49,444
Uncle came back.

862
01:47:54,534 --> 01:47:55,808
Uncle!

863
01:47:58,534 --> 01:47:59,842
We will not talk to him.

864
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:11,380
- Give me dinner.
- Aren't you waiting for Uncle to come?

865
01:48:11,901 --> 01:48:13,380
No, we were angry.

866
01:48:14,567 --> 01:48:16,376
- Really?
- Yes.

867
01:48:18,534 --> 01:48:22,414
- Whose side are you on now?
- on your.

868
01:48:23,067 --> 01:48:25,946
Talk to Sonu.  Tell
him dinner is ready.

869
01:48:27,067 --> 01:48:30,514
- Are you talking to him?
- no way.

870
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:34,338
I'll tell you, my sister-in-law is talking to her.

871
01:48:35,034 --> 01:48:37,310
I do not care if he comes or not.

872
01:48:38,034 --> 01:48:39,377
- Right?
- Yes.

873
01:48:43,667 --> 01:48:45,271
Talking to you for dinner.

874
01:48:47,067 --> 01:48:50,207
Come on!  Why is this?

875
01:48:51,034 --> 01:48:52,308
Get up.

876
01:48:54,467 --> 01:48:57,676
Do you know what she cooked for you?

877
01:48:58,067 --> 01:49:01,742
- I'm not hungry.
- Aren't you hungry...?

878
01:49:02,701 --> 01:49:04,305
why not?  Get up.

879
01:49:05,034 --> 01:49:07,913
- Get up now.
- I do not want to eat.

880
01:49:09,034 --> 01:49:11,640
No need to eat...
I'll call my sister-in-law.

881
01:49:16,401 --> 01:49:18,312
I'll send one to your sister-in-law too.

882
01:49:20,034 --> 01:49:24,915
I will not allow your
happiness to be stolen.  no way.

883
01:49:30,067 --> 01:49:31,907
Give your brother pictures
and a negative one.

884
01:49:32,067 --> 01:49:35,913
- Take anything from me.
- Wealth comes and goes.

885
01:49:37,034 --> 01:49:38,911
Drink first.

886
01:49:42,534 --> 01:49:45,413
Can you give me pictures if I drink this?

887
01:49:46,534 --> 01:49:47,911
I do not promise.

888
01:49:49,501 --> 01:49:53,415
If you look at me
with love it will happen.

889
01:49:59,567 --> 01:50:02,138
- Give the negative.
- It's too early, isn't it?

890
01:50:02,967 --> 01:50:05,004
- Get some more.
- Can't drink any more.

891
01:50:05,567 --> 01:50:08,104
No need to buy one.

892
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:10,404
Get some more.

893
01:50:29,567 --> 01:50:33,913
I'm sorry I'm late.

894
01:50:34,567 --> 01:50:36,012
It's fun.

895
01:50:37,567 --> 01:50:39,444
what are you saying?

896
01:50:40,567 --> 01:50:42,911
That's a big deal.

897
01:50:43,534 --> 01:50:47,414
- Great thing...
- Brother is upstairs.

898
01:50:47,934 --> 01:50:50,414
I'll talk to my sister-in-law.

899
01:50:51,534 --> 01:50:55,380
- Look what happened to him.
- Sonu, what about you?

900
01:51:00,534 --> 01:51:04,107
What is this smell, are you drunk?

901
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:10,447
It's a kind of juice.

902
01:51:11,567 --> 01:51:12,841
You came home drunk, didn't you?

903
01:51:13,568 --> 01:51:17,448
- Shut up!
- What if my brother comes home drunk?

904
01:51:18,534 --> 01:51:19,911
I'm jumping in the river.

905
01:51:41,567 --> 01:51:42,978
What did you do here?

906
01:51:44,967 --> 01:51:47,174
She's trying to destroy you.

907
01:51:47,834 --> 01:51:52,408
If I do not drink, she said she would
send your letters and pictures home.

908
01:52:00,534 --> 01:52:03,105
I will perish, but I will
not let you be humiliated.

909
01:52:31,534 --> 01:52:35,141
"Come on, don't torture me"

910
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:41,212
"I want to whisper
something in your ear."

911
01:52:42,567 --> 01:52:44,945
"Come on, don't torture me"

912
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:51,071
"I want to whisper
something in your ear."

913
01:53:09,567 --> 01:53:13,811
"At this hour I am yours"

914
01:53:14,568 --> 01:53:17,845
"I'm so lucky to have you here."

915
01:53:19,601 --> 01:53:23,413
"I do not mind if you
do not give me a gift"

916
01:53:24,567 --> 01:53:27,946
"You should have come"

917
01:53:29,567 --> 01:53:32,275
"You should have come"

918
01:53:37,034 --> 01:53:40,413
"Don't torture me, come closer"

919
01:54:06,134 --> 01:54:09,741
"The world will dance to my tune"

920
01:54:10,867 --> 01:54:14,144
"The weather is beautiful"

921
01:54:16,067 --> 01:54:22,416
"You have no idea
what my love desires"

922
01:55:07,501 --> 01:55:11,449
"Eyes show the
condition of my heart"

923
01:55:12,067 --> 01:55:14,946
"They ask you"

924
01:55:17,067 --> 01:55:20,913
"You're so cruel, make me laugh"

925
01:55:22,034 --> 01:55:24,913
"Let the stars shine"

926
01:55:27,067 --> 01:55:29,570
"Come to Earth from the Stars"

927
01:56:00,101 --> 01:56:01,978
Come on, don't torture me.

928
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:12,477
Leave me alone.

929
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,445
Aren't you ashamed?  let go.

930
01:56:22,067 --> 01:56:25,605
did you see?  Sonu came
home drunk today too.

931
01:56:26,067 --> 01:56:28,240
Why are you silent?
Why don't you say anything?

932
01:56:29,034 --> 01:56:31,947
What can I say?  It's my fault.

933
01:56:35,467 --> 01:56:37,913
Are you wrong

934
01:56:40,100 --> 01:56:43,980
I mean fate is against us.

935
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:50,446
Sonu drinks and comes home.

936
01:56:51,067 --> 01:56:54,674
I do not understand who
stole my home peace.

937
01:56:55,067 --> 01:56:56,944
May he perish.

938
01:57:00,067 --> 01:57:01,546
What does it mean to criticize others?

939
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:14,480
My house is on fire.
I have to put out the fire.

940
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:16,704
I will fix the zone.

941
01:57:28,067 --> 01:57:30,946
- Come to me.
- Shameless...

942
01:57:31,567 --> 01:57:34,946
Aren't you ashamed?
You are my husband's brother.

943
01:57:35,667 --> 01:57:38,238
He does not even drink
water without God's permission.

944
01:57:38,734 --> 01:57:40,611
You're coming home drunk.

945
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:44,946
He sits with his head bowed
in shame because of you.

946
01:57:46,134 --> 01:57:48,978
Is he ashamed of me?

947
01:57:51,101 --> 01:57:53,980
He has no ability to face anyone.

948
01:57:55,101 --> 01:57:56,580
Why didn't I die?

949
01:58:41,501 --> 01:58:45,378
I'm leaving this house today.

950
01:58:45,401 --> 01:58:49,710
I can not stand the thought of
drinking in a place of worship.

951
02:00:14,834 --> 02:00:17,404
- Master?
- Where is my sister-in-law?

952
02:00:17,834 --> 02:00:20,678
- Where is everyone?
- They're gone.

953
02:00:23,601 --> 02:00:26,241
- Have dinner.
- I do not eat.

954
02:00:26,601 --> 02:00:29,081
- I'll eat with Uncle.
- Don't read about him.

955
02:00:30,568 --> 02:00:32,775
- I do not eat.
- is it?

956
02:00:36,567 --> 02:00:38,103
Uncle.

957
02:00:43,601 --> 02:00:45,239
You, my child do not touch.

958
02:00:49,634 --> 02:00:51,875
I do not want a drunkard
to influence my child.

959
02:00:52,601 --> 02:00:54,478
Come on.

960
02:01:05,567 --> 02:01:07,945
- How are you?
- Welcome!

961
02:01:08,601 --> 02:01:12,105
I am not afraid of him.
Do you not know what he did?

962
02:01:12,634 --> 02:01:14,511
He is not fit to associate
with gentlemen.

963
02:01:15,101 --> 02:01:16,978
I have never done anything like that.

964
02:01:22,134 --> 02:01:23,511
You do not trust me?

965
02:01:27,034 --> 02:01:28,809
I came here to ask you for help.

966
02:01:29,601 --> 02:01:32,480
Come and pretend to
be a shameless, moralist.

967
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:50,773
Didn't your sister come?
When will she return?

968
02:01:51,634 --> 02:01:54,979
Tomorrow morning?  Why not talk?

969
02:01:55,634 --> 02:01:57,739
- When will she be back?
- Never.

970
02:01:59,601 --> 02:02:00,944
Let me be alone.

971
02:02:07,334 --> 02:02:10,474
The more I try to fix
things, the worse it gets.

972
02:02:11,567 --> 02:02:15,105
I do this to save her,
but now she hates me.

973
02:02:15,567 --> 02:02:17,171
She left me.

974
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:38,806
Are you happy now

975
02:02:51,634 --> 02:02:55,480
If you can find peace and
happiness by drinking...

976
02:02:56,634 --> 02:02:58,511
... you will bear this grief.

977
02:02:59,967 --> 02:03:03,471
But you are destroying yourself.

978
02:03:04,967 --> 02:03:06,503
At least let me know.

979
02:03:08,101 --> 02:03:09,705
What can I tell you?

980
02:03:11,101 --> 02:03:15,641
It is said that man drinks
alcohol to forget his grief.

981
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:20,944
Why are you sad?

982
02:03:22,067 --> 02:03:24,513
I am your wife, your partner
in happiness and sorrow.

983
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:28,007
- Tell me about this.
- Nothing.

984
02:03:28,634 --> 02:03:31,581
Everything will be alright, trust me.

985
02:03:34,134 --> 02:03:40,346
If I don't trust you,
I'm not here either.

986
02:03:44,100 --> 02:03:45,477
I should have left you too.

987
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:48,579
The brother and son went.

988
02:03:51,101 --> 02:03:53,047
Maybe it's for your convenience.

989
02:03:57,734 --> 02:04:04,978
I'm going too, but a wife is
leaving home for a cremation.

990
02:04:07,134 --> 02:04:10,479
I can never be happy without you.

991
02:04:16,134 --> 02:04:17,977
- But I'm leaving you too.
- No.

992
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:21,979
How do I live like this?

993
02:04:23,101 --> 02:04:26,378
- Listen to me.
- Now I'm not asking.

994
02:04:29,134 --> 02:04:32,343
If you haven't arrived by 6pm today...

995
02:04:34,134 --> 02:04:35,613
... I'm going to Bombay tomorrow.

996
02:04:42,134 --> 02:04:45,013
I can not stand it.
Brother, what can I do?

997
02:05:08,134 --> 02:05:11,047
- Going so early?
- I have homework.

998
02:05:14,134 --> 02:05:15,442
Did your wife call you?

999
02:05:17,634 --> 02:05:22,344
Do not be angry.  Go,
but first give me a smile.

1000
02:05:24,567 --> 02:05:26,979
as you wish.

1001
02:05:41,634 --> 02:05:46,515
Please God let him
come home at six.

1002
02:05:48,634 --> 02:05:50,136
And I don't want to go.

1003
02:05:50,634 --> 02:05:53,513
I don't want to leave him.

1004
02:05:57,634 --> 02:05:59,875
Dear God, he is this house.

1005
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:02,477
You heard my prayer.

1006
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:45,341
you are a liar.

1007
02:07:45,834 --> 02:07:47,313
A fraud.

1008
02:07:48,134 --> 02:07:49,977
What are you saying?

1009
02:07:50,667 --> 02:07:52,510
I have never cheated on anyone.

1010
02:07:53,634 --> 02:07:56,513
I did not know you
were so cunning.

1011
02:07:57,067 --> 02:08:00,105
- You are a fraud.
- are you mad?

1012
02:08:01,168 --> 02:08:05,514
I wish I was crazy.
I do not understand, what's wrong?

1013
02:08:07,134 --> 02:08:09,614
What have I done?

1014
02:08:10,134 --> 02:08:11,408
What have you done?

1015
02:08:12,134 --> 02:08:13,511
what is this?

1016
02:08:15,534 --> 02:08:18,242
I thought your friend
just gave you a drink.

1017
02:08:19,901 --> 02:08:22,973
But you're a lot
lower than that.

1018
02:08:24,134 --> 02:08:26,740
Don't even say my name.
I am not one of you.

1019
02:08:29,668 --> 02:08:33,309
If I come near you, if I catch
you, I will commit suicide.

1020
02:08:33,367 --> 02:08:35,944
I will give my life.  Get away.

1021
02:08:36,101 --> 02:08:37,912
Get away.

1022
02:08:39,634 --> 02:08:41,511
From now on there is no connection between us.

1023
02:08:51,100 --> 02:08:52,477
It's not your fault

1024
02:08:56,667 --> 02:09:00,513
I just said send
it home on time.

1025
02:09:01,668 --> 02:09:03,545
You sent him.

1026
02:09:06,134 --> 02:09:09,513
People say you know everything.

1027
02:09:11,101 --> 02:09:12,512
You know what is in every heart

1028
02:09:13,134 --> 02:09:14,841
Is this what I wanted?

1029
02:09:15,634 --> 02:09:17,011
Is this what I asked of you?

1030
02:09:28,667 --> 02:09:33,138
Now I do not ask for mercy from anyone.

1031
02:09:35,701 --> 02:09:40,514
No connection now, I'm leaving.

1032
02:09:43,667 --> 02:09:45,544
I will go forever.

1033
02:10:02,634 --> 02:10:04,545
Can I go to court tomorrow morning?

1034
02:10:06,667 --> 02:10:11,047
Your wife wants a divorce.

1035
02:10:34,634 --> 02:10:37,205
I'm going to get a car.

1036
02:10:38,667 --> 02:10:40,544
- Why is that?
- Your wife is going to court

1037
02:12:38,667 --> 02:12:42,513
The judge is busy.
You will have to wait a bit.

1038
02:13:13,134 --> 02:13:18,345
Keep these keys safe.

1039
02:13:19,634 --> 02:13:21,272
I have it in the jewelry closet.

1040
02:13:23,634 --> 02:13:29,550
I could not keep the envelopes properly.
Keep them packaged.

1041
02:13:32,867 --> 02:13:35,074
Ramu is not well.

1042
02:13:38,167 --> 02:13:42,047
Do you remember I brought him
some medicine from the bomb?

1043
02:13:44,167 --> 02:13:47,011
Give them every night.
Otherwise he will continue to cough.

1044
02:13:52,134 --> 02:13:54,011
I forgot to say the important thing.

1045
02:13:56,200 --> 02:13:58,771
Pray to God after you take
a shower every morning.

1046
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:01,443
Or starve all day.

1047
02:14:02,967 --> 02:14:06,039
The red flowering plant I planted...

1048
02:14:08,201 --> 02:14:11,705
... water it daily,
or it will dry out.

1049
02:14:15,834 --> 02:14:17,677
Take care of your diet.

1050
02:14:19,567 --> 02:14:23,014
I made you a little pickle
to pick it up, remind Ramu.

1051
02:14:23,534 --> 02:14:26,743
You're leaving everything.
Who's taking care of me now?

1052
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:30,680
Can I take care of all this?

1053
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:33,571
No, you ruined everything.

1054
02:14:34,201 --> 02:14:37,080
There is nothing that you can do about it.
You can't even eat alone.

1055
02:14:37,601 --> 02:14:39,638
You know them and leave me

1056
02:14:41,734 --> 02:14:45,944
Should I leave you, or
should you let me go?

1057
02:14:47,667 --> 02:14:49,044
You do not understand.

1058
02:14:50,667 --> 02:14:55,309
Only the lucky
ones feel what I did.

1059
02:14:58,134 --> 02:15:02,674
I'm so happy in my world...

1060
02:15:03,167 --> 02:15:06,637
- I will not let you go.
- We can't live together.

1061
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:10,079
You cheated on me.  You are a liar.

1062
02:15:11,201 --> 02:15:12,771
- That's a lie.
- Brother.

1063
02:15:17,201 --> 02:15:20,546
- You're going to make a big mistake.
- You don't know what he did.

1064
02:15:21,168 --> 02:15:24,047
- I saw it myself.
- What you see and hear...

1065
02:15:24,567 --> 02:15:27,047
... it's all a lie.
Sonu is an unblemished person.

1066
02:15:27,568 --> 02:15:29,809
A good husband, a dear brother to me.

1067
02:15:30,134 --> 02:15:32,341
I have never seen such an honest man.

1068
02:15:33,168 --> 02:15:36,047
- No doubt Sonu...
- Brother.

1069
02:15:36,601 --> 02:15:39,181
What are you doing here?
I will not let you say that.

1070
02:15:39,234 --> 02:15:42,772
- If you say another word...
- Don't make me a promise.

1071
02:15:44,201 --> 02:15:48,047
I am the elder brother but
I did not behave like that.

1072
02:15:50,201 --> 02:15:52,044
I was a burden to you with my question.

1073
02:15:52,667 --> 02:15:56,046
My sins scratched your forehead.

1074
02:16:01,434 --> 02:16:04,108
Ramu told us that
Geetha wanted a divorce.

1075
02:16:06,100 --> 02:16:10,014
My family and name
can no longer be insulted.

1076
02:16:11,434 --> 02:16:16,315
Today my wife, child, brother
are all sad because of me.

1077
02:16:16,700 --> 02:16:18,577
For God's sake, keep quiet.

1078
02:16:22,201 --> 02:16:24,340
Your wife is going to
divorce you because of me.

1079
02:16:25,201 --> 02:16:27,374
Your beloved sister-in-law hates you.

1080
02:16:28,168 --> 02:16:32,048
When your friends
see you, they avoid you.

1081
02:16:32,567 --> 02:16:34,046
Do you want me to keep quiet?

1082
02:16:34,568 --> 02:16:38,778
I swear, I destroyed myself.
That you will not be harmed.

1083
02:16:45,201 --> 02:16:48,114
Do you know why
sin is so dangerous?

1084
02:16:49,600 --> 02:16:51,876
Because there is no harm to that sinner.

1085
02:16:53,201 --> 02:16:56,808
But he has to pay for
his innocent loved ones.

1086
02:16:58,200 --> 02:16:59,577
The bride...

1087
02:17:02,167 --> 02:17:04,807
Sonu accepted responsibility for my sin.

1088
02:17:06,168 --> 02:17:09,047
- Now what happens when your wife finds out?
- I told her everything.

1089
02:17:11,167 --> 02:17:12,339
What did you do here?

1090
02:17:13,167 --> 02:17:14,544
She will commit suicide.

1091
02:17:15,534 --> 02:17:18,014
If she dies I will commit suicide.

1092
02:17:28,201 --> 02:17:29,761
- Where is my sister-in-law?
- Not at home.

1093
02:17:37,167 --> 02:17:41,047
"What if my brother
comes home drunk"

1094
02:17:41,501 --> 02:17:43,037
"I'm jumping in the river"

1095
02:18:25,201 --> 02:18:26,680
- sister in law.
- This is why.

1096
02:18:28,834 --> 02:18:32,613
- You...?
- Why are you screaming?

1097
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:36,577
Is this true?

1098
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:41,341
I'm pretty much like dead
because you didn’t tell me the truth.

1099
02:18:41,467 --> 02:18:42,547
I was upset.

1100
02:18:43,167 --> 02:18:46,046
You did all this to
save me from grief.

1101
02:18:46,667 --> 02:18:49,341
And I hit you, I cursed you.

1102
02:18:53,201 --> 02:18:54,578
I'm not sorry.

1103
02:18:55,967 --> 02:18:58,912
I got you guys and
now everything is ok.

1104
02:19:01,234 --> 02:19:08,083
If I had known these things before,
I would have committed suicide.

1105
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:11,841
But your sacrifice washed away his sins.

1106
02:19:12,168 --> 02:19:14,045
You saved us all.

1107
02:19:18,167 --> 02:19:20,647
elder sister!
