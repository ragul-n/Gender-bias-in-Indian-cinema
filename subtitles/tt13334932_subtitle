It's only till Tuesday, I swear!
I'm totally free after that.

00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:24,352
Hey! You know I love you, right?
You know that.

00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:25,765
When?

4
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:28,798
Wait. I'll call you back.

5
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,251
What's up, bro?

6
00:01:34,243 --> 00:01:34,946
Hmm?

7
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:37,079
Talking to your girlfriend?

8
00:01:39,828 --> 00:01:40,703
Yeah.

9
00:01:42,876 --> 00:01:44,876
You screwed my life!
-Bro! Bro! Bro!

10
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:46,110
That camera's worth 6 lakhs.

00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:47,712
Bro, please!

12
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:50,743
Please, bro.

Man, let's get out of here.

It's so cheap, waiting outside
a ladies hostel like this.

19
00:02:28,668 --> 00:02:29,995
You can leave if you want to.

20
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:32,120
I don't need you here.
I can handle it.

Leave!

Tell him that's going to repeat again now.

25

Hello, boss. I said you can leave.

You're a respected person in the society.

Don't call me in the morning again.

I'm looking at you.

have here in the morning?

Well, he got away, sir.

I tried to run and tripped
on the chips stand.

52

So you're innocent?
-Yes, sir.

53
00:04:22,838 --> 00:04:24,400
It's on him completely.
-Yes, sir.

54

He fooled you and escaped, is it?

How come, sir?

What was that movie which featured
Victory Venkatesh as a cop?

this profession is not as savage.

life other than my parents.'

for 2 and a half years.'

okra makes you a Maths genius.'

Good morning, sir.

115
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,744
'She didn't say yes or no.'

116
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:08,556
'There's one reply that's more terrifying.'

In the classroom...

118
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:14,603

119
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,728
You're daring, man.
-Sir... Sir...

120
00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:21,846
Now that I'm in the final year of
Engineering, I dared to do it.

121
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:23,158
But when I was in the first year...

122
00:08:25,643 --> 00:08:26,486

123

-Alright.

Let's elope then. What say?

126

Okay.

129

You sold her jewelry and got married.
Now you're on your honeymoon.

I wasn't talking to you.
-But I was.

Hello!
-Hey! Is this how you talk to your senior?

133
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,814
You don't have the basic
etiquette of speaking to a girl.

135
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,727

-I won't tolerate this.

Worst kind of a guy you are!
-You're a junior. Remember that.

137

She'll complain. Take it easy.
-Excuse me, sir.

138

I'm not comfortable doing this.

Pull them down or I'll screw you!

148
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:51,462
Don't even think of taking a
break until we get back.

149
00:09:52,931 --> 00:09:53,799
Take care!

150
00:09:55,994 --> 00:09:58,424
Get started!

Bro, who was that girl?
She's beautiful!

154
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:08,002
How would I know, bro?
It's my first day as well.

155
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,415
But you're right. She's pretty.
I think I'm going to go talk to her.

156

Excuse me.
-Yeah?

159
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:25,135

-Yeah.

Getting the feels, huh?

162
00:11:25,782 --> 00:11:27,962
It was the wind. Focus.

163
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:12,728
Bro, how do I look?

164
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:15,025
There's something under your eye.
-Where? Where?

165
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:16,955
Right there.
-Is it gone?

166
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,727
You look fine. Just go.

-What is this?

You're first years, okay?
What about you? Acting smart, huh?

169
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,328
Didn't I ask you to cut your hair?
-But it's a Tuesday, sir.

170
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:27,852
Pass me that.

171
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:30,703
Quickly.

172
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,720
How many...?

173
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:38,336
How many subjects are
there in the first year?

'In the second year, I
grew my beard a little.'

00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,332
When you're a first year student...

180
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:58,910
You fear the seniors,
as they might rag you.

181
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:01,168
When you're a 4th year student...

182
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,496
You fear ruining things
for yourself in the end.

183
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:08,375
But when you're a 2nd year student...

184
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:11,668
You're fearless.

185
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:14,531
You don't have to fear anybody.

186
00:13:16,223 --> 00:13:19,258
You can walk straight through
the college gate with swag.

eyes and say you love her...'

00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,277
I think I'm in love with you.

No. No. I know I'm in love with you.

Vinod, you're a great guy and...

a very nice friend.

199

You have all the qualities
of a perfect guy.

You being a perfect guy...

And you being perfect for me...

203
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,848
They're two different things, right?

204
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,887

Get up!

You don't even know which
lecture is going on.

To ogle at girls?

217
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:31,644
You want love?

218
00:15:37,364 --> 00:15:39,426
Sir, I wasn't talking.

219
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:42,488

-I'm telling you, please get out.

You failed thrice in M1.

If he's serious about you,
he'll only come back.

230

Do you really want to be in
a relationship right now?

happened in your absence?

How do you know?
-I do.

Because the answer sheet that
was sent to the University...

268

It wasn't yours.

269
00:18:48,513 --> 00:18:50,032

-What?!

270
00:18:51,184 --> 00:18:53,536
How's that possible?
-It's possible.

Excuse me. Can you please be a
little more clear? -Sorry. Sorry.

-Relax!

00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:13,477
So, because you cheated...

277
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:15,148
It's okay for me to cheat, huh?

278
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:20,426
Why did you switch my answer sheet
without my permission anyway?

279
00:19:21,222 --> 00:19:24,261
It was a 1st year subject.
-So?

280
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:27,457
If you fail, you can't apply for Google.
-Oh, thank you.

281
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:32,410
Now I'll carry the guilt of cheating
in this subject, throughout my life.

degree anymore. -Vineetha... Please!

ever going to quiz you on it again.

don't deserve this degree because of this.

It's wrong to bribe the lecturer.

291

And it's wrong to feel guilty
for something I haven't done.

292

And above all that...

293
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:09,707
You're expecting a thank you from me.

294
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:11,856
Now that's stupid.

295

What does she expect?
To become the Prime Minister of India?

302
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,461
She wants to pass.
But without feeling guilty.

303
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:47,571
Also, she wants to keep her pride.

304
00:20:47,645 --> 00:20:49,363
If pride is her main concern...

305

on a ladies night at the club...

307

312

I'm really sorry.

313
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:33,279

Not just that.

315
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:38,739

00:24:15,795 --> 00:24:17,505
And now I'm marrying
the Chairman's daughter.

352
00:24:19,764 --> 00:24:22,091
I know that you proposed Vineetha.

353
00:24:24,193 --> 00:24:25,068
It's cool.

354
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:28,841
You see, as long as she
doesn't have a problem...

355
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,326
Everything is all good.

356
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:32,388
It's fine, really.

357
00:24:33,576 --> 00:24:35,160
But when she starts feeling bothered...

358
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:39,365
Anyway, I've got to go.

359
00:24:39,904 --> 00:24:40,654
Bye.

360
00:24:55,381 --> 00:24:58,287
If you could understand her,
where's the fun in that?

361
00:24:58,686 --> 00:25:00,451
None of my ideas work out, dad.

362
00:25:01,055 --> 00:25:03,802
You mean helping her pass the exam...

363
00:25:03,827 --> 00:25:06,966
and getting the blind across the road?

364
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:08,443
You should be honest, man.

365
00:25:10,412 --> 00:25:14,240
I proposed in the classroom.
That's being honest, right?

366
00:25:15,662 --> 00:25:16,826
No. That's rushing things.

367
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:20,069
Then she could've just said no.

368
00:25:20,193 --> 00:25:21,084
Come on!

369
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,763
I get that she didn't say yes.

370
00:25:25,044 --> 00:25:26,676
But she didn't say no either.

371
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:29,537
Boys! Your breakfast is ready.

372
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,966
Dad!

373
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:49,233
Help yourself.

374
00:25:49,638 --> 00:25:50,965
Mani...
-Hmm?

375
00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:53,301
You're looking hot.

376
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:54,927
I know.

377
00:25:55,232 --> 00:25:57,333
Umm... Excuse me. Sir?

378
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,802
Can you please continue?
-Yes, of course.

379
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:03,232
Don't rush at all.

380
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:06,115
First, she should get to know you.

381
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:08,302
Take her out, but...

382
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:09,849
Only as friends.

383
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,895
Let her feel comfortable around you.

384
00:26:15,451 --> 00:26:16,404
Then propose again.

385
00:26:17,082 --> 00:26:18,677
And if she says yes then...

386
00:26:19,114 --> 00:26:20,505
The relationship will be solid.

387
00:26:22,788 --> 00:26:24,701
But, what if she says no then?

388
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,974
Find someone else.
-Come on!

389
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:29,373
I tried flattering 8 girls.

390
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:31,169
Your mom was the 9th.

391
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,169
If she says no...

392
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,302
You have to move on in life.

393
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:43,802
Your life and your beer
should always be C-H-I-L-L.

394
00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:46,412
Chill. It's going to work beautifully.

395
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,060
Okay. Yeah.

396
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:53,326
Hey!
-Yeah?

397
00:26:53,748 --> 00:26:55,341
What's with the puppy face?

398
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:58,380
Be confident. Be a man.

399
00:26:58,498 --> 00:26:59,709
Widen your chest.

400
00:27:01,084 --> 00:27:02,044
Done. Come on.

401
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:10,529
Hi.

402
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:14,505
It's Nikki's birthday tomorrow.

403
00:27:17,467 --> 00:27:18,451
Why don't you come?

404
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:21,106
She won't. Her father will not approve.

405
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,216
Father?

406
00:27:27,732 --> 00:27:29,474
Will you come if he approves?

407
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:35,459
Hmm?

408
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,248
Will you ask him?

409
00:27:38,474 --> 00:27:39,192
Yeah.

410
00:27:40,787 --> 00:27:41,490
Go ahead.

411
00:28:00,357 --> 00:28:01,169
Hello, sir.

412
00:28:01,623 --> 00:28:02,966
Hi.
-What?!

413
00:28:04,354 --> 00:28:05,646
My name is Siddhu, sir.

414
00:28:06,397 --> 00:28:08,638
Vineetha's classmate.
-Oh, hi.

415
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:12,435
Sir, I need your permission
to take Vineetha out.

416
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,137
What do you mean?

417
00:28:15,185 --> 00:28:18,254
As in, it's my friend
Nikki's birthday tomorrow.

418
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:19,932
We're going in a group.
Niharika is also tagging along.

419
00:28:19,987 --> 00:28:20,854
Oh.

420
00:28:21,897 --> 00:28:24,893
It's in a group.
So I wanted to ask you...

421
00:28:25,052 --> 00:28:27,763
Uncle! You shouldn't be waiting
in line at our college.

422
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,677
It's okay.
-No, it's very embarrassing.

423
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:31,057
That's okay, dear.

424
00:28:31,553 --> 00:28:33,349
By the way, this is Siddhu.

425
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:35,216
Apparently Vineetha's classmate.

426
00:28:35,241 --> 00:28:36,427
Oh, hi!

427
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,091
So you're Siddhu.
-I mean, yeah.

428
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:43,732
Hi.
-Hi.

429
00:28:43,748 --> 00:28:46,029
This is Meghana. Karthik's fiance.

430
00:28:46,372 --> 00:28:47,637
Oh!

431
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:50,474
This is my college.
-Okay.

432
00:28:53,342 --> 00:28:54,959
Hi. Hey, guys.

433
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,638
Alright. You guys can go.

434
00:28:57,107 --> 00:28:59,307
I don't mind if Vineetha is willing to go.

435
00:28:59,332 --> 00:29:01,166
Oh. Great, uncle. Thanks.

436
00:29:06,815 --> 00:29:08,955
Uncle, we'll be late for our flight.
Let's go?

437
00:29:09,184 --> 00:29:10,635
Yeah, sure. We'll leave.

438
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:13,049
Best wishes.
-Thank you, sir.

439
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:13,981
See you.

440
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,823
Airport is a long way from here.

441
00:29:17,411 --> 00:29:19,036
Vineetha...
-What?

442
00:29:19,473 --> 00:29:20,776
Are you out of your mind?

443
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:22,199
I was just kidding.

444
00:29:26,536 --> 00:29:27,432
What happened?

445
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:28,904
Is she coming or not?

446
00:29:29,526 --> 00:29:30,244
Huh?

447
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:50,221
"As the distance begins to fade..."

448
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:56,033
"It feels like a miracle"

449
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:59,455
"My smile only widens"

450
00:30:03,603 --> 00:30:08,268
"Not settling for less this time"

451
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:12,665
"Let our story unfold beautifully"

452
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,846
"Let me add my name to yours"

453
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:21,955
"Let me discover your adorable side"

454
00:30:22,815 --> 00:30:27,151
"Those glances that we
share from across the room"

455
00:30:27,354 --> 00:30:32,135
"They make time slow down
and push you towards me"

456
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:36,791
"Before you come close
and throw a smile at me"

457
00:30:36,932 --> 00:30:41,557
"Why don't you read what's in my heart?"

458
00:30:51,745 --> 00:30:56,526
"Let me be your sweet symphony"

459
00:30:56,551 --> 00:31:01,330
"Let me be the fantasy in your eyes"

460
00:31:01,355 --> 00:31:06,143
"Let me fully absorb
that this isn't a dream"

461
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:11,033
"Let me live these moments one at a time"

462
00:31:13,643 --> 00:31:16,643
"As time slows down..."

463
00:31:21,104 --> 00:31:23,178
"It feels like a miracle"

464
00:31:23,202 --> 00:31:25,939
"My smile only widens"

465
00:31:47,854 --> 00:31:49,612
Okay, cool. I'll get going.

466
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:50,869
See you guys. Have fun.

467
00:31:50,894 --> 00:31:53,330
But we have tickets booked
for the 10:45 show.

468
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:56,718
Yeah. Let's go from here.
-Oh, we're going?

469
00:31:57,335 --> 00:31:59,909
I thought your evening would be packed.

470
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:02,776
If that was the case, why
would I book the tickets?

471
00:32:04,307 --> 00:32:07,409
Maybe because you don't have any
plans with Siddhu. Is that right?

472
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:08,307
Siddhu?

473
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:10,304
What does he have to do with this?

474
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,726
You cancelled our plan last
time for him, didn't you?

475
00:32:13,368 --> 00:32:15,979
But I made this movie plan now, didn't I?

476
00:32:16,004 --> 00:32:18,128
Did I ask for it? Did I?

477
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:20,697
Make all your plans with Siddhu.

478
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:23,088
You don't have to sacrifice
anything for me, Vineetha.

479
00:32:25,705 --> 00:32:28,603
Niharika, you're not speaking your mind.

480
00:32:29,456 --> 00:32:31,088
What's the matter? Please be clear.

481
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:35,901
Hey, kids. What's up!

482
00:32:37,635 --> 00:32:38,611
Nothing much, Karthik.

483
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:41,259
I was just leaving.

484
00:32:42,322 --> 00:32:43,291
What!

485
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,611
She's very possessive, Meghana.

486
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:54,400
Can't watch me growing
close to anyone else.

487
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:55,245
Wrong.

488
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:57,650
If you become close to someone else...

489
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:00,026
She's afraid that you won't
give her as much importance.

490
00:33:01,065 --> 00:33:04,174
When you snatch a kid's
favorite toy from him...

491
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:05,746
This is exactly how he'd react.

492
00:33:07,643 --> 00:33:09,408
And, talking about toys...

493
00:33:10,182 --> 00:33:11,025
Siddhu.

494
00:33:12,932 --> 00:33:13,853
Do you like him?

495
00:33:20,737 --> 00:33:21,823
I do, Meghana.

496
00:33:22,604 --> 00:33:25,010
He's really sweet.

497
00:33:25,854 --> 00:33:27,987
But, he rushes into everything.

498
00:33:28,143 --> 00:33:30,948
You know what I mean?
Like, very impulsive.

499
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:33,635
Makes decisions in a split second.

500
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:35,906
Deviates from them as quickly too.

501
00:33:36,173 --> 00:33:38,220
You think Karthik is Mr. Perfect?

502
00:33:39,189 --> 00:33:41,321
We should change them over time.

503
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:44,752
So...

504
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:51,908
"As I call out your name..."

505
00:33:52,315 --> 00:33:57,065
"I hear it echo in the layers of my heart"

506
00:33:57,167 --> 00:34:00,721
"As I knock the doors of your soul..."

507
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:05,205
"Welcome me in with open arms"

508
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:12,572
"As the distance begins to fade..."

509
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,702
"It feels like a miracle"

510
00:34:18,726 --> 00:34:21,440
"My smile only widens"

511
00:34:26,292 --> 00:34:30,705
"Not settling for less this time"

512
00:34:31,057 --> 00:34:35,221
"Let our story unfold beautifully"

513
00:34:35,246 --> 00:34:39,635
"Let me add my name to yours"

514
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:44,424
"Let me discover your adorable side"

515
00:34:45,448 --> 00:34:49,893
"Those glances that we
share from across the room"

516
00:34:49,979 --> 00:34:54,822
"They make time slow down
and push you towards me"

517
00:34:55,042 --> 00:34:59,300
"Before you come close
and throw a smile at me"

518
00:34:59,528 --> 00:35:04,027
"Why don't you read what's in my heart?"

519
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:09,004
"Let me be your sweet symphony"

520
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:11,966
So, when will your parents be back?

521
00:35:12,232 --> 00:35:13,114
Tomorrow morning.

522
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:16,457
Which means, you're going to
throw me out of your house.

523
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,871
Or... we could get married.

524
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:20,699
You could stay.

525
00:35:22,357 --> 00:35:23,255
Shut up.

526
00:35:28,903 --> 00:35:30,949
So, Vineetha...
-Hmm?

527
00:35:31,184 --> 00:35:32,246
Are your periods over?

528
00:35:35,348 --> 00:35:36,223
No.

529
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:51,135
Hi, sir. How did you like the biryani?

530
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:53,222
There are no spices in the biryani, man.

531
00:35:53,613 --> 00:35:55,973
Oh. Extremely sorry, sir.
-I ordered one with extra spices, right?

532
00:35:56,106 --> 00:35:57,403
Can I replace the order, sir?

533
00:35:57,472 --> 00:35:59,854
Some more masala, maybe?
-It's done. Nothing much you can do now.

534
00:36:12,597 --> 00:36:13,394
Come here.

535
00:36:16,684 --> 00:36:18,192
What?
-Closer.

536
00:36:57,606 --> 00:36:58,981
Adarsh, get changed.

537
00:37:00,255 --> 00:37:01,340
Guys, ready.

538
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,987
You go back.

539
00:37:07,012 --> 00:37:08,058
You come forward.

540
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:12,158
He has all the pomp to fool his clients.

541
00:37:12,183 --> 00:37:13,339
Top photographer, I see.

542
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:16,222
He's only doing Karthik-Meghana's
pre-wedding photo shoot.

543
00:37:17,089 --> 00:37:17,878
Mm-hmm.

544
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,020
I guess that's what's trending these days.

545
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:26,543
Well, it's a huge set up.

546
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:28,261
What's the deal? Hmm?

547
00:37:28,856 --> 00:37:29,676
Shut up.

548
00:37:30,636 --> 00:37:32,159
It's my gift to Karthik.

549
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,917
So he's helping me out.

550
00:37:35,277 --> 00:37:39,105
You could just gift him a
carton of beers and he'd chill.

551
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:40,488
No!

552
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,660
Okay.

553
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:44,395
Just imagine.

554
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:47,957
Meghana and Karthik have been
in love for 7 years now.

555
00:37:48,747 --> 00:37:50,817
I've witnessed their
entire journey together.

556
00:37:51,223 --> 00:37:53,223
But ever since they got engaged...

557
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:56,240
They only seem more in love to me.

558
00:37:56,694 --> 00:37:58,198
I want to capture those moments.

559
00:37:58,334 --> 00:38:00,878
Hang a life-size photograph on their wall.

560
00:38:01,326 --> 00:38:03,693
Because 40 years later...

561
00:38:03,896 --> 00:38:05,482
It wouldn't be just a photograph.

562
00:38:05,912 --> 00:38:06,870
It's a feeling.

563
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:09,795
And I want to be the one
to give them that feeling.

564
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:15,677
Welcome to Venugopal family.

565
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,256
Over the years...

566
00:38:18,536 --> 00:38:21,888
I've felt the void of not
having my husband around.

567
00:38:24,092 --> 00:38:26,302
But today...

568
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,459
Meghana's got an extended family.

569
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:33,855
In this happy moment...

570
00:38:35,873 --> 00:38:39,131
My husband would've been
really happy if he was here.

571
00:38:39,904 --> 00:38:41,131
We love you, aunty.

572
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,927
Meghana's family now.

573
00:38:42,936 --> 00:38:44,565
You don't worry. What say?
-That's right, dad.

574
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,644
Come on, aunty. We can't see you like this.

575
00:38:47,669 --> 00:38:51,175
You're an inspiration.
-I'm fine. Just got a little emotional.

576
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,839
We love you.
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

577
00:38:57,616 --> 00:38:59,907
'When we were getting all emotional...'

578
00:39:00,064 --> 00:39:01,954
'A red sports car entered the premises.'

579
00:39:02,768 --> 00:39:05,689
'Young Rebel Star Prabhas got down.'

580
00:39:14,071 --> 00:39:15,037
Holy shit!

581
00:39:15,975 --> 00:39:18,100
Prabhas attended your family function?!

582
00:39:24,271 --> 00:39:25,786
Not really, sir.

583
00:39:27,302 --> 00:39:30,771
I was just checking if you
were paying attention.

584
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:33,842
Hmm. Okay. Awesome.

585
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,427
Awesome? Seriously?

586
00:39:40,397 --> 00:39:41,154
Listen...

587
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,170
Instead of charging you
in an eve teasing case...

588
00:39:45,202 --> 00:39:48,615
I'm listening to your story
and you're playing me?

589
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,311
You can be easily fooled, sir.

590
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,412
Why would Prabhas attend
their family function?

591
00:39:54,865 --> 00:39:56,052
Pavan...

592
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,473
Release the petty theft guy.

593
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:03,427
Lock this bastard in there.

594
00:40:04,286 --> 00:40:06,154
Also, grab my baton.

595
00:40:08,131 --> 00:40:08,904
Make sure to oil it.

596
00:40:08,929 --> 00:40:12,256
Why would you need to oil the baton, sir?
-Don't screw with me, you asshole!

597
00:40:15,428 --> 00:40:16,201
Get lost!

598
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,389
Why were you at the ladies hostel?

599
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:26,623
Vineetha was furious that I
missed my supplementary exam.

600
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,146
Is that a reason to break up?

601
00:40:29,154 --> 00:40:31,131
We didn't actually break up, sir.

602
00:40:31,717 --> 00:40:33,837
I thought it'd get me your sympathy.

603
00:40:33,861 --> 00:40:35,420
You swore you wouldn't hit me.

604
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:39,381
Alright then.

605
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:41,131
Call your dad.

606
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:44,263
Why, sir? -You guys are good friends,
right? Ask him to come down.

607
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,006
Sir, my dad's not the problem here.
It's my mom.

608
00:40:47,037 --> 00:40:49,920
If she found out, she would
cancel my Goa trip. Please, sir.

609
00:40:49,945 --> 00:40:54,192
Why are you going to Goa?
-For that photo shoot I mentioned earlier.

610
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:57,028
It's a gift from Vineetha.
We've hired a top photographer.

611
00:40:57,053 --> 00:40:59,278
Niharika's uncle...
-Who's Niharika now?

612
00:40:59,496 --> 00:41:02,543
Vineetha's best friend, sir. How
could you forget? -What the hell!

613
00:41:02,568 --> 00:41:04,919
You're narrating from the beginning again.
Just do the damn sign and get lost.

614
00:41:04,944 --> 00:41:06,840
Okay. Okay. Alright.

615
00:41:11,122 --> 00:41:13,216
Do I have to pay a fine?
-Get the hell out!

616
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,574
Hey! Watch yourself in Goa.
-Okay, sir.

617
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,247
Cops there are not as nice as I am.

618
00:41:18,272 --> 00:41:19,505
They'll shove a stick up your ass.

619
00:41:20,405 --> 00:41:21,248
Bloody hell!

620
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:23,459
He didn't forge, did he?

621
00:41:32,155 --> 00:41:33,184
Hello.
-Hello?

622
00:41:35,591 --> 00:41:36,067
Hello?!

623
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:39,068
Yeah, aunty. Tell me.
-I won't be in town for a couple of days.

624
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:41,435
I can't look after
Meghana's VISA processing.

625
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,412
Is that fine?

626
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,677
Yeah, okay.
-Are you sure?

627
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:47,966
Umm... Just a second.

628
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:53,481
Vineetha, can you please call Siddhu?
-Relax. I'm calling.

629
00:41:53,506 --> 00:41:55,561
And guys, be safe with the water.

630
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:59,075
There was this guy in my circle.
Waves just dragged him in.

631
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,442
Take care. Bye.

632
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:04,598
Vineetha...

633
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,045
Where the hell are you guys?

634
00:42:06,076 --> 00:42:07,341
We came out on a jog.

635
00:42:08,373 --> 00:42:11,388
What nonsense! Is Karthik with you?
-Yeah, he's right here.

636
00:42:11,444 --> 00:42:13,934
Karthik, Vineetha wants to talk to you.
I'm putting him on line.

637
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,763
Just shut up and come.
-I'll call you back.

638
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,232
Bro! Bro! Bro!

639
00:42:20,365 --> 00:42:22,856
You have a photo shoot.
Vineetha will kill me.

640
00:42:23,247 --> 00:42:24,989
I think I need to go to the hospital, man.

641
00:42:25,014 --> 00:42:28,708
What is this nonsense, man!
-It's okay. Relax. You're fine.

642
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:30,614
Where did you bring us, dude?

643
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,341
You only told me last night
that you wanted to see nature.

644
00:42:48,114 --> 00:42:49,347
America batch, huh?

645
00:42:49,772 --> 00:42:51,818
No. They're from UK.

646
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:54,520
He's James and that's Lisa.

647
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,567
They met in Goa 5 years back.

648
00:42:57,052 --> 00:42:59,826
They're back here to have a Hindu marriage.

649
00:43:00,084 --> 00:43:00,951
Sweet.

650
00:43:01,137 --> 00:43:04,278
Siddhu wants to organize the whole thing.

651
00:43:04,303 --> 00:43:07,442
Are we here for a photo shoot
or some foreigners' wedding?

652
00:43:07,864 --> 00:43:09,715
He's your boyfriend.
You only handle him.

653
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,613
You were saying?

654
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,192
Okay. Let's go.

655
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:22,301
Go where?

656
00:43:22,732 --> 00:43:24,950
You girls aren't coming.
-What?

657
00:43:25,161 --> 00:43:29,857
We have to throw a bachelor party
for Karthik and James here.

658
00:43:30,764 --> 00:43:33,748
Bro!
-I can't, man. Sorry.

659
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,834
Karthik?
-No, thanks. My stomach is upset.

660
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:41,591
Two pegs of brandy, warm
water and honey is your fix.

661
00:43:41,615 --> 00:43:45,662
You're going to glow for the
photo shoot tomorrow. Let's go!

662
00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:45,007
Dude, take us to the shore.
-We have our photo shoot today.

663
00:44:45,485 --> 00:44:47,118
But Siddhu has no common sense.

664
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:52,017
Huh?

665
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:53,455
Meghana...

666
00:44:53,931 --> 00:44:55,601
Relax.
-What relax, Karthik?

667
00:44:56,431 --> 00:44:57,829
She's supposed to talk to him.

668
00:44:58,432 --> 00:44:59,976
Boozing and fooling around all the time.

669
00:45:01,868 --> 00:45:02,624
Fine.

670
00:45:03,399 --> 00:45:04,915
What's next, hmm?

671
00:45:05,228 --> 00:45:07,814
Can we do a photo shoot tomorrow?
-I'll talk to him.

672
00:45:08,744 --> 00:45:13,547
But Meghana, there's been a small
issue regarding your VISA.

673
00:45:13,572 --> 00:45:14,830
We should go to Hyderabad urgently.

674
00:45:15,585 --> 00:45:17,499
I didn't mean to...
-What the fuck, Karthik!

675
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:20,806
VISA was your responsibility.
You said your colleagues got it done.

676
00:45:20,978 --> 00:45:22,931
If you were incapable,
you should've told me, right?

677
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,561
Yeah.
-This is just not happening.

678
00:45:25,586 --> 00:45:27,086
What about the photo shoot?

679
00:45:29,546 --> 00:45:32,210
Look. Our return tickets
are already booked.

680
00:45:33,018 --> 00:45:34,570
Yeah? Okay?

681
00:45:36,049 --> 00:45:37,596
We will finish the photo shoot, dear.

682
00:45:38,127 --> 00:45:39,267
Karthik, it's getting late.

683
00:45:40,026 --> 00:45:40,916
Coming!

684
00:45:47,674 --> 00:45:49,205
What do we eat? Pancakes?

685
00:45:51,024 --> 00:45:53,072
Chocolate chip pancakes for me.

686
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,639
Hi.
-Hey.

687
00:46:20,467 --> 00:46:21,365
What's wrong?

688
00:46:21,756 --> 00:46:23,771
Nothing. Very tired. That's all.

689
00:46:26,765 --> 00:46:28,898
Vineetha, I know that
you're a little upset.

690
00:46:29,992 --> 00:46:31,483
The photo shoot got cancelled.

691
00:46:32,226 --> 00:46:35,124
But you didn't have to take
it out on me since morning.

692
00:46:36,154 --> 00:46:37,537
But you were the reason it got cancelled.

693
00:46:37,905 --> 00:46:39,819
Please don't be upset
about something so petty.

694
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:42,538
Karthik is coming back in 2 days.

695
00:46:42,789 --> 00:46:44,273
We'll do the photo shoot again.

696
00:46:48,655 --> 00:46:50,327
Don't just walk away.

697
00:46:50,499 --> 00:46:52,053
Karthik's clients are visiting from UK.

698
00:46:52,304 --> 00:46:52,929
They're not coming.

699
00:46:52,954 --> 00:46:54,804
Okay. But that isn't my fault.
-See?

700
00:46:56,273 --> 00:46:59,186
The photo shoot is cancelled
and you're least bothered.

701
00:46:59,211 --> 00:47:01,421
Vineetha, it's just a bloody photo shoot.

702
00:47:01,446 --> 00:47:04,460
It's not just a bloody photo shoot!

703
00:47:06,171 --> 00:47:08,647
I wanted to make it a
beautiful memory for him.

704
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:10,826
You go.

705
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,374
Go get drunk.

706
00:47:12,553 --> 00:47:13,867
That's more important to you.

707
00:47:16,031 --> 00:47:18,413
Vineetha, please!
-Please leave me alone, Siddhu.

708
00:47:19,952 --> 00:47:21,507
Don't nag me like this, Vineetha.

709
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,084
What's your problem?

710
00:47:26,335 --> 00:47:29,460
My problem is that you're not
serious about anything in life.

711
00:47:29,485 --> 00:47:31,936
Please! Not again.
-Forget about the photo shoot.

712
00:47:32,453 --> 00:47:33,905
Right from your career choices...

713
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:35,975
You got that job at Google for me.

714
00:47:36,757 --> 00:47:39,671
If I choose MBA in the US,
you'd follow me there.

715
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:41,991
What if you don't get in?

716
00:47:44,046 --> 00:47:47,115
Alright. What if you get in and I don't?
-Then I won't go there.

717
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,187
See? You don't have clarity or
seriousness about anything in life.

718
00:47:52,475 --> 00:47:54,241
I'm doing all of this for you, Vineetha.

719
00:47:55,601 --> 00:47:56,976
I'm damn serious about you.

720
00:48:07,108 --> 00:48:07,975
I don't know.

721
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:17,370
"Before I realize you're not around"

722
00:48:17,753 --> 00:48:24,011
"Don't show up and startle me"

723
00:48:24,036 --> 00:48:30,073
"My glances chase you everywhere"

724
00:48:30,097 --> 00:48:34,011
"And hit back at me like an arrow"

725
00:48:35,368 --> 00:48:41,300
'Words can't describe this feeling"

726
00:48:41,441 --> 00:48:44,995
"Silence speaks a ton"

727
00:49:10,004 --> 00:49:14,746
"For the first time"

728
00:49:15,612 --> 00:49:19,234
"I've hurt you badly"

729
00:49:21,309 --> 00:49:25,824
"This is my plea"

730
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:30,119
"Hoping you'd forgive me"

731
00:49:30,144 --> 00:49:31,230
Will you marry me?

732
00:49:31,856 --> 00:49:36,668
"What do I say to this love?"

733
00:49:38,846 --> 00:49:39,712
Right now.

734
00:49:40,371 --> 00:49:41,262
Right here.

735
00:49:42,454 --> 00:49:48,009
"We push and pull
Rise and fall together"

736
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:54,345
"Come fall into my arms already"

737
00:49:54,370 --> 00:50:00,142
"My glances chase you everywhere"

738
00:50:00,506 --> 00:50:04,685
"And hit back at me like an arrow"

739
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:11,427
"Words can't describe this feeling"

740
00:50:11,927 --> 00:50:15,888
"Silence speaks a ton"

741
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:32,988
Now this is what we call a crazy wedding.

742
00:50:33,651 --> 00:50:34,651
Siddhu...

743
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:36,083
Siddhu...

744
00:50:37,193 --> 00:50:38,934
You were a bachelor until yesterday.

745
00:50:39,379 --> 00:50:40,520
But now, you're a husband.

746
00:50:40,881 --> 00:50:41,974
How do you feel?

747
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:08,409
Now, this is what we call a crazy wedding.

748
00:51:08,956 --> 00:51:09,800
Siddhu?

749
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:11,519
Siddhu?

750
00:52:50,552 --> 00:52:53,995
Are you talking about
that shitty viral video?

751
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,587
If it were you, I would've kicked your ass.

752
00:52:56,661 --> 00:52:58,207
Get this into your head.
This isn't Vegas.

753
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:02,208
You turned out to be like Ram
Charan from the film 'Orange'.

754
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:07,669
People will lose their minds
over this love episode of yours.

755
00:53:19,899 --> 00:53:20,680
Hello.

756
00:53:22,196 --> 00:53:23,141
Hello, Srujana.

757
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:25,345
-Hello.

758
00:53:26,141 --> 00:53:28,539
Did you eat?
-Yeah, I did.

759
00:53:29,485 --> 00:53:31,219
Hey, what's wrong?

760
00:53:31,884 --> 00:53:32,774
-Nothing.

761
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,696
Are you breaking up with me?

762
00:53:34,899 --> 00:53:37,000
-What?
-I said are you breaking up with me?

763
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,102
That's what I've been telling
you since yesterday.

764
00:53:39,376 --> 00:53:41,102
So you've decided?
-Yes.

765
00:53:41,438 --> 00:53:43,047
So you can screw...***

766
00:53:43,072 --> 00:53:45,860
Get the hell out!

767
00:53:48,532 --> 00:53:51,383
Listen to me, you bastard!

768
00:53:52,086 --> 00:53:53,454
You asshole!

769
00:53:53,462 --> 00:53:55,930
Can you spell 'Government'?
-No.

770
00:53:56,727 --> 00:53:59,305
You're a Government employee. Can
you spell 'Government'? -No!

771
00:53:59,399 --> 00:54:01,844
Tell me. Can you spell 'Government'?

772
00:54:02,048 --> 00:54:03,149
You can't!

773
00:54:03,859 --> 00:54:05,883
Kiss her, man! Kiss her!

774
00:54:05,891 --> 00:54:08,522
Don't be scared.
I'm right here.

775
00:54:08,547 --> 00:54:10,547
Shut up, guys!
-They're on a roll!

776
00:54:12,995 --> 00:54:16,414
If you break down this video, we
can understand a lot of things.

777
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,540
My next project, I mean...

778
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:22,242
So recently, I came across this video.

779
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,696
Listen. You're influenced
by the Western Culture.

780
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:27,423
That doesn't give you a
right to defame our own.

781
00:54:27,446 --> 00:54:29,399
Something clicked in that video for me.

782
00:54:29,424 --> 00:54:33,079
So I'm trying to develop that story.

783
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:35,094
Some couple is chilling
in Goa, getting married.

784
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:38,430
We're chilling in our
house, watching that video.

785
00:54:38,618 --> 00:54:42,188
They sparked cultural controversies
and used cuss words.

786
00:54:42,267 --> 00:54:43,828
They deserve to be thrashed.

787
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:45,946
When did feelings come into the picture?

788
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:50,547
Don't you think it's wrong to
get drunk and then get married?

789
00:54:50,571 --> 00:54:53,672
Everyone in that video,
especially that guy and girl...

790
00:54:53,797 --> 00:54:55,672
They owe us an apology in public.

791
00:54:55,697 --> 00:54:57,594
Our country is either over-sensitive.

792
00:54:57,783 --> 00:55:00,039
Or there are too many jobless
people in the country.

793
00:55:00,204 --> 00:55:03,601
Seems like they've played by all the
elements that would make it viral.

794
00:55:03,765 --> 00:55:05,110
Looks well-planned.

795
00:55:05,267 --> 00:55:08,031
What did the video even have to go viral?

796
00:55:08,056 --> 00:55:09,938
There are going to be severe consequences.

797
00:55:09,971 --> 00:55:11,844
Take it easy, man. Chill out.

798
00:55:11,907 --> 00:55:14,219
What was that saying? Yeah, I got it.

799
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,836
A random couple got married and public
is making it their personal business.

800
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:21,313
They're having fun at their wedding.
Why would you get in the middle of that?

801
00:55:23,743 --> 00:55:24,508
Listen.

802
00:55:24,899 --> 00:55:26,782
If they're making it into
a film, demand money.

803
00:55:28,181 --> 00:55:29,641
Don't give me that death stare.

804
00:55:29,946 --> 00:55:31,391
He's planning to make it into a movie.

805
00:55:31,993 --> 00:55:33,641
You might as well make money out of it.

806
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:36,899
Alright then. See you guys.

807
00:55:36,923 --> 00:55:38,149
Wait. Stay a little longer.

808
00:55:38,696 --> 00:55:41,407
Have beer. Let's chill, dude.
-I'll go, man.

809
00:55:41,587 --> 00:55:44,766
Don't let the Media get to you.
-I said I have to go!

810
00:55:46,001 --> 00:55:48,282
I'm leaving. Why are you
being a pain in the ass?

811
00:55:52,281 --> 00:55:53,907
Siddhu, come on!

812
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:57,602
He's already frustrated.
Why are you adding fuel to fire?

813
00:56:09,391 --> 00:56:10,648
Stop! Stop! Stop!

814
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:16,429
This is not a 'drink and drive' case.
You're drinking while driving.

815
00:56:17,634 --> 00:56:18,555
Come on out.

816
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,353
Come on. Don't waste my time.

817
00:56:21,134 --> 00:56:21,993
Fuck!

818
00:56:23,469 --> 00:56:24,766
Are you going to bring that beer along?

819
00:56:26,993 --> 00:56:29,711
Take 200 rupees and let me go.
-I don't accept bribes.

820
00:56:32,486 --> 00:56:33,626
Why are you testing him?

821
00:56:33,651 --> 00:56:35,618
I can smell the alcohol
all the way from here.

822
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:38,485
Sir! He was having beer while driving.

823
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,180
Wow!

824
00:56:41,892 --> 00:56:43,985
"My friend is back from Goa"

825
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,727
"Bow down to him, everyone!"

826
00:56:46,954 --> 00:56:50,469
Hey! You got married and
become an Internet sensation.

827
00:56:50,749 --> 00:56:53,843
When are you throwing me a party?
Anyway, tell me.

828
00:56:54,429 --> 00:56:55,570
Is it the same girl?

829
00:56:58,133 --> 00:56:59,265
Where did you go on your honeymoon?

830
00:57:00,579 --> 00:57:02,812
We broke up, sir.
-Siddhu, enough!

831
00:57:03,172 --> 00:57:04,952
Don't lie again for sympathy sake.

832
00:57:04,977 --> 00:57:06,493
I'll let you go.
Now tell me the truth.

833
00:57:06,518 --> 00:57:08,563
I'm seriosuly not lying, sir.
-Really?!

834
00:57:09,258 --> 00:57:10,797
But it hasn't even been 5 months.

835
00:57:11,415 --> 00:57:12,680
Pavan, you heard that?

836
00:57:14,102 --> 00:57:16,469
Who the fuck is that?

837
00:57:19,695 --> 00:57:20,398
Bring him over.

838
00:57:21,751 --> 00:57:23,719
Hello!
-Hey!

839
00:57:24,031 --> 00:57:24,812
What's wrong?

840
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,251
What's up? Let's go.

841
00:57:27,276 --> 00:57:29,430
Are we going to your officer?
-Yes, let's go.

842
00:57:29,603 --> 00:57:30,438
I don't mind.

843
00:57:35,938 --> 00:57:37,000
Hello, sir.

844
00:57:38,001 --> 00:57:40,383
What were you doing there?
-I was a bit drunk, sir.

845
00:57:40,454 --> 00:57:42,758
I don't know about my driver but.

846
00:57:43,485 --> 00:57:46,165
He saw the check post and vanished.

847
00:57:46,353 --> 00:57:49,071
Give me a driver and I'll head home.
-We should give you a driver?

848
00:57:52,978 --> 00:57:54,290
Who on Earth would have
a driver for a bike?

849
00:57:54,315 --> 00:57:56,181
I have money, sir. So I hired one.

850
00:57:57,126 --> 00:57:59,212
What do you do?
-I'm an actor, sir.

851
00:58:01,305 --> 00:58:04,047
In soap operas?
-No, sir. In movies.

852
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:07,462
Didn't you watch 'Gabbar Singh'?
-'Gabbar Singh', huh?

853
00:58:07,548 --> 00:58:08,485
Stand back there.

854
00:58:09,765 --> 00:58:11,751
Why are you ignoring me, sir?

855
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:15,079
Your story is boring. After all,
you hired a driver for your bike.

856
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:19,859
This guy over here has issues with
his girl. Let's hear him out.

857
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:22,321
Stand back.
-Move it.

858
00:58:22,978 --> 00:58:23,860
Tell me, Siddhu.

859
00:58:32,734 --> 00:58:33,618
What's to tell, sir?

860
00:58:34,884 --> 00:58:36,133
You watched that video, right?

861
00:58:38,171 --> 00:58:39,077
That was it.

862
00:58:42,194 --> 00:58:45,623
[singing randomly]

863
00:58:50,826 --> 00:58:54,751
'Guys, hush! Teacher is here.'

864
00:58:54,783 --> 00:58:57,533
'Ma'am, I didn't finish my homework.'
-'What's with the garlands?'

865
00:58:57,797 --> 00:58:59,467
'We two are married now.'

866
00:58:59,664 --> 00:59:01,337
'Do whatever the hell you can.'

867
00:59:02,194 --> 00:59:05,725
'Siddhu, don't say that.
-Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry.'

868
00:59:05,844 --> 00:59:08,406
'I forgot that you two are best friends.'

869
00:59:08,431 --> 00:59:10,397
'In fact, why didn't you
both go on our honeymoon?'

870
00:59:16,155 --> 00:59:18,883
'You should make out, guys.
Make out! Make out!'

871
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:25,037
'You turned out to be like Ram
Charan from the film 'Orange'.

872
00:59:26,256 --> 00:59:30,545
People will lose their minds
over this love episode of yours.

873
00:59:40,115 --> 00:59:42,055
'Ma'am, don't touch!'

874
00:59:42,427 --> 00:59:44,685
'This is not our culture.'

875
00:59:45,591 --> 00:59:47,841
'Stop being a grandma.
Fuck culture!'

876
00:59:47,935 --> 00:59:51,892
'Vineetha and I honestly wanted to
get married and that's what we did.'

877
00:59:51,908 --> 00:59:52,735
'Kiss her, man! Kiss her!'

878
01:00:05,249 --> 01:00:09,320
I spend 30,000 dollars on the
Digital Media Department per annum.

879
01:00:09,563 --> 01:00:10,687
You guys realize?

880
01:00:12,897 --> 01:00:15,897
You need my permission to pull
this down from the Internet?

881
01:00:22,498 --> 01:00:25,037
Alright. Summon PRO Prabhu.

882
01:00:25,646 --> 01:00:28,716
Spend money. Bribe people.
Bloody buy them out!

883
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,256
I don't care.

884
01:00:38,224 --> 01:00:39,505
Okay, sir. Thank you so much.

885
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:43,849
Bro, I just spoke with
'Silly Monks' Sanjay.

886
01:00:43,857 --> 01:00:46,443
He swore to pull it down from the website.
-Please make sure, bro.

887
01:00:46,459 --> 01:00:48,724
Extremely sorry, bro.
-Please make it quick.

888
01:00:48,749 --> 01:00:52,005
It's not a big deal. It'll be off
the website in a couple of days.

889
01:00:52,021 --> 01:00:54,505
But we need damage control
on these Whatsapp groups.

890
01:00:54,545 --> 01:00:55,927
Bastards take screenshots.

891
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,685
Hello, mom. Stop calling me so many times.

892
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:00,138
I said I'll call you back, okay?

893
01:01:01,528 --> 01:01:02,353
Please!

894
01:01:03,014 --> 01:01:05,294
Mom, stop bothering me.

895
01:01:05,372 --> 01:01:06,982
I said I'll talk to you later.

896
01:01:07,614 --> 01:01:09,169
We were just partying, mom.

897
01:01:10,705 --> 01:01:12,490
My mom and your mom spoke with each other.

898
01:01:13,346 --> 01:01:14,544
They're feeling really low.

899
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:16,580
They can't even step out of the house.

900
01:01:16,718 --> 01:01:18,661
And my dad's acting up.

901
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,599
I was dancing drunk and shirtless
and you didn't bother to stop me?

902
01:01:22,201 --> 01:01:23,036
I should've told you?

903
01:01:23,744 --> 01:01:25,896
Didn't you realize what you were doing?

904
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,841
I'm neck deep in problems.
Stop being such a pussy.

905
01:01:27,866 --> 01:01:30,025
You're so self-obsessed, I mean...
-Damn right, I am!

906
01:01:37,904 --> 01:01:38,826
Don't watch that stuff.

907
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,474
I'm here for you.

908
01:01:46,635 --> 01:01:48,818
Hello.
-You have a flight to Vizag in 2 hours.

909
01:01:48,866 --> 01:01:50,333
Pack your bags. I'll see you there.

910
01:02:14,692 --> 01:02:15,554
Mani...

911
01:02:28,795 --> 01:02:29,930
I'm sorry, dad.

912
01:02:30,201 --> 01:02:31,904
I don't want your apology.

913
01:02:33,036 --> 01:02:35,121
I want an explanation from you.

914
01:02:35,512 --> 01:02:36,825
And Siddhu as well.

915
01:02:37,881 --> 01:02:39,153
Where are your used clothes?

916
01:02:40,692 --> 01:02:43,078
You can't mix them with fresh ones.
-Mom... Mom...!

917
01:02:44,755 --> 01:02:45,599
I'm sorry.

918
01:02:48,975 --> 01:02:49,703
It's okay.

919
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:53,507
What did dad say?
-What do you think?

920
01:02:54,255 --> 01:02:55,187
He's blaming himself.

921
01:02:56,209 --> 01:02:58,685
Saying he's responsible.
-How come?

922
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:04,677
When you make a mistake,
he doesn't blame you.

923
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:06,786
Doesn't let me scold you either.

924
01:03:07,388 --> 01:03:09,216
Making mistakes is really important.

925
01:03:09,372 --> 01:03:10,419
There's no point in yelling at you.

926
01:03:10,724 --> 01:03:12,810
You should learm from your own mistakes.

927
01:03:13,324 --> 01:03:14,047
His words.

928
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:17,349
Your dad and I have a difference
of opinion in this context.

929
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,107
But what you did now...

930
01:03:21,411 --> 01:03:23,567
It has affected everyone around you.

931
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:26,685
And he's taking responsibility for it.

932
01:03:47,701 --> 01:03:49,154
In situations like these...

933
01:03:49,419 --> 01:03:52,568
The girl becomes the easy
target in the current society.

934
01:03:55,849 --> 01:03:58,380
So, Vineetha needs you now.

935
01:03:58,974 --> 01:04:00,052
More than ever.

936
01:04:07,325 --> 01:04:08,100
Okay?

937
01:04:35,131 --> 01:04:39,224
Two cappuccinos, please.
-Is this hotel far from here?

938
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,497
I'll just go talk to them and come.
-Let's leave.

939
01:05:19,013 --> 01:05:21,529
I don't know how to handle
this situation, Siddhu.

940
01:05:22,435 --> 01:05:25,083
I have no clue.
-Baby, listen...

941
01:05:25,724 --> 01:05:26,779
Why are you crying?

942
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,435
I'm right here, okay?

943
01:05:42,912 --> 01:05:44,092
Actually, it's my fault.

944
01:05:49,818 --> 01:05:51,091
I only rushed into it.

945
01:05:55,763 --> 01:05:57,787
I didn't think of the repercussions.

946
01:05:58,599 --> 01:06:01,357
Now you're hurt because of me.
-Siddhu, stop! Please!

947
01:06:01,756 --> 01:06:04,138
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

948
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:07,099
It's okay. I said it's fine.
-I'm really sorry.

949
01:06:07,124 --> 01:06:10,318
I didn't mean for this to happen.
-It's okay. I'm here for you.

950
01:06:11,209 --> 01:06:11,904
Huh?

951
01:06:13,036 --> 01:06:14,817
You know I can't see you like this.

952
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,388
You're my strength and you know it.

953
01:06:20,036 --> 01:06:21,631
Promise?
-I promise.

954
01:06:26,303 --> 01:06:27,083
Come on.

955
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:29,770
Now give me that sexy smile of yours.

956
01:06:30,162 --> 01:06:32,396
I know that my smile isn't that sexy.

957
01:06:33,654 --> 01:06:34,833
It's not?

958
01:06:35,638 --> 01:06:36,763
Who told you?

959
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:37,740
Hmm?

960
01:06:38,873 --> 01:06:40,888
Those dimples...

961
01:06:41,428 --> 01:06:45,076
And those eyes that melt my heart...

962
01:06:51,513 --> 01:06:52,349
What?

963
01:07:50,763 --> 01:07:51,615
Uncle...

964
01:07:52,631 --> 01:07:53,560
I'm sorry.

965
01:07:54,053 --> 01:07:55,271
It's my fault.

966
01:07:55,834 --> 01:07:57,357
What are you apologizing for?

967
01:07:58,037 --> 01:07:59,287
For marrying my daughter?

968
01:07:59,811 --> 01:08:01,396
Or for the leaked video?

969
01:08:02,224 --> 01:08:04,888
Trust me when I say this wasn't planned.

970
01:08:06,857 --> 01:08:09,607
Vineetha and I had a fight in Goa.

971
01:08:10,396 --> 01:08:13,450
I wanted to show her how
serious I was about her.

972
01:08:13,717 --> 01:08:15,919
He doesn't care about what the
world has to say about us.

973
01:08:16,513 --> 01:08:18,646
We've become a bloody joke
in the community. -Karthik!

974
01:08:18,811 --> 01:08:20,669
You weren't there, okay?

975
01:08:20,935 --> 01:08:22,845
You don't know what happened there.
-Then tell me!

976
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:25,848
I'll understand.
How could you guys be so foolish?

977
01:08:25,967 --> 01:08:27,357
Karthik! Calm down.

978
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,439
Do you know the repercussions
of this dirty little feat?

979
01:08:35,662 --> 01:08:39,247
My father never said a thing
to me throughout my life.

980
01:08:39,709 --> 01:08:41,341
And now I'm out of the family.

981
01:08:42,748 --> 01:08:44,302
Uncle...
-Dad!

982
01:08:45,615 --> 01:08:46,576
Have some water.

983
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,388
Dad!

984
01:08:49,396 --> 01:08:51,771
Dad, are you okay?
-I'm okay!

985
01:08:53,225 --> 01:08:54,107
I'm okay.

986
01:08:58,490 --> 01:08:59,403
Okay, Siddhu.

987
01:09:01,177 --> 01:09:02,700
Everybody back at home is curious.

988
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,239
What do I tell them?

989
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,162
I don't care about what they think, uncle.

990
01:09:08,818 --> 01:09:10,154
I'm only answerable to you.

991
01:09:10,365 --> 01:09:12,443
Every time they talk about Vineetha...

992
01:09:12,623 --> 01:09:14,888
They will bring up her father, right?

993
01:09:15,412 --> 01:09:16,169
Uncle.

994
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:18,521
We did a mistake.

995
01:09:19,553 --> 01:09:20,607
We're also married now.

996
01:09:21,334 --> 01:09:22,576
What do you want me to do now?

997
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:24,724
Because you two are married...

998
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:26,926
You're saying I can't touch you.

999
01:09:26,951 --> 01:09:28,375
I didn't mean it like that, uncle.
-That's not what he said, dad.

1000
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,384
Shut up, Vineetha!

1001
01:09:30,222 --> 01:09:31,604
Did I say something wrong?

1002
01:09:32,644 --> 01:09:36,542
Are you also saying I can't do
anything because you two are married?

1003
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:39,923
Why are you so arrogant?

1004
01:09:40,678 --> 01:09:43,701
Didn't you parents teach
you basic etiquette?

1005
01:09:45,075 --> 01:09:48,099
Uncle, please! Why are you
involving my parents?

1006
01:09:48,174 --> 01:09:50,152
I don't have to do that again, Siddhu.

1007
01:09:50,459 --> 01:09:52,545
They're responsible for your actions.

1008
01:09:52,693 --> 01:09:56,005
I guess they didn't bother
to correct your mistakes.

1009
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,490
Idiots!

1010
01:09:59,388 --> 01:10:01,638
Dad, please! It's his parents
we're talking about.

1011
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:03,856
Sid, I'm sorry.

1012
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:15,247
Uncle, listen.

1013
01:10:17,107 --> 01:10:19,392
I didn't want to say this.
But I'll let it out now.

1014
01:10:20,889 --> 01:10:22,091
We're already married.

1015
01:10:23,356 --> 01:10:24,411
What can you do?

1016
01:10:31,575 --> 01:10:32,676
There's something you don't know yet.

1017
01:10:33,756 --> 01:10:35,482
We also slept together. Now talk.

1018
01:10:38,622 --> 01:10:40,029
Karthik! Karthik, no!

1019
01:10:40,506 --> 01:10:43,232
Karthik, don't.
Let him go! Please!

1020
01:10:43,256 --> 01:10:44,544
Just stop! No!

1021
01:10:45,873 --> 01:10:46,771
Calm down.

1022
01:10:54,504 --> 01:10:55,535
Siddhu, I'm sorry.

1023
01:10:57,215 --> 01:10:58,020
Damn it!

1024
01:11:02,045 --> 01:11:03,865
You need to apologize to my dad.

1025
01:11:04,021 --> 01:11:06,353
Apologize, take your bag
and get out of my house.

1026
01:11:18,106 --> 01:11:20,537
You can't be serious, man!
-What's wrong, bro?

1027
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:23,638
What you did has already embarrassed
her in front of her family.

1028
01:11:23,663 --> 01:11:25,060
How could you add fuel to fire?

1029
01:11:25,092 --> 01:11:27,951
Why does everyone keep saying
that I messed this up?

1030
01:11:27,967 --> 01:11:32,474
Bro, this is how the blame game works.

1031
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:34,990
Whoever's fault it was,
it's the guy who's blamed.

1032
01:11:35,015 --> 01:11:37,685
You seem to know about the
blame game a little too well.

1033
01:11:37,709 --> 01:11:40,591
What are you still doing here?
-Give me a driver and I'll go, sir.

1034
01:11:40,732 --> 01:11:43,193
There you go about the driver again!
How many drinks did you have?

1035
01:11:43,217 --> 01:11:45,643
About three small bottles, sir.
-Why did you drink so much?

1036
01:11:49,576 --> 01:11:50,444
I had a break up, dude.

1037
01:11:50,469 --> 01:11:53,615
Do you have anything going on in
your life except for break ups?

1038
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,504
Sir, you're cheating.

1039
01:11:55,631 --> 01:11:57,115
What did I do now?

1040
01:11:57,291 --> 01:12:00,708
You're clarifying your
doubts about his love story.

1041
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:02,427
But you're not letting me clariify mine.

1042
01:12:02,553 --> 01:12:03,794
What are your doubts?

1043
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:05,645
It was raining outside.

1044
01:12:05,783 --> 01:12:09,068
He was banging his girlfriend in the car.

1045
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,408
Before he got to the interesting
part, story jumped a few scenes.

1046
01:12:13,463 --> 01:12:15,938
What the hell did you just
say about my girlfriend?

1047
01:12:15,963 --> 01:12:18,166
Hey! Are you kidding me 'cause I'm soft?

1048
01:12:18,191 --> 01:12:18,705
What!

1049
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:19,354
Huh?

1050
01:12:20,498 --> 01:12:23,404
I'm going to break your bones
into pieces, mind you!

1051
01:12:24,596 --> 01:12:26,877
It's my wife you're talking about.
Show some respect.

1052
01:12:26,902 --> 01:12:28,424
Or I'll beat your ass up.

1053
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:34,873
Do you have a cigarette, bro?
-I don't smoke.

1054
01:12:34,896 --> 01:12:36,896
Have you gone mad?
He's not going to narrate now.

1055
01:12:36,912 --> 01:12:38,935
What did I say, sir?
-What?

1056
01:12:39,692 --> 01:12:41,947
Seriously? You don't know what you said?

1057
01:12:42,634 --> 01:12:45,054
Didn't you say I was
banging my girlfriend?

1058
01:12:45,079 --> 01:12:48,345
I didn't mean to offend you, bro.
-Offend me, my ass!

1059
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:50,615
How could you say that?
You said you have an ex-girlfriend.

1060
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:53,579
Will you take it if I insult her?

1061
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:56,795
Asshole!
-Sir! He just called me an asshole!

1062
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:58,485
He's young blood. Ignore it.

1063
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:00,005
Now apologize.

1064
01:13:00,615 --> 01:13:02,107
I said apologize to him.

1065
01:13:03,771 --> 01:13:05,912
Sorry, bro.
-Get lost! I don't care.

1066
01:13:07,469 --> 01:13:09,971
Will you listen to the rest
of the story or go home?

1067
01:13:09,996 --> 01:13:11,704
I'll listen to the story, sir. Yes.

1068
01:13:18,131 --> 01:13:18,896
What next?

1069
01:13:31,552 --> 01:13:33,114
Did you eat anything?
-No.

1070
01:13:34,266 --> 01:13:35,118
Come and eat.

1071
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:41,825
What happened?

1072
01:13:42,631 --> 01:13:43,380
There was a fight.

1073
01:13:44,154 --> 01:13:45,005
What fight?

1074
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:50,638
Alright.

1075
01:13:50,949 --> 01:13:52,473
You should take a break for a while.

1076
01:13:53,036 --> 01:13:54,481
Will you go to your aunt's place?

1077
01:13:56,905 --> 01:13:58,266
Dad...
-Yeah?

1078
01:14:02,889 --> 01:14:04,005
When are your exams starting?

1079
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:06,927
22nd.
-You only have 15 days.

1080
01:14:08,083 --> 01:14:09,282
And how many backlogs?

1081
01:14:10,872 --> 01:14:12,942
Four.
-Concentrate.

1082
01:14:14,076 --> 01:14:17,118
Enough of monkey business. I think
it's time you get serious now, Siddhu.

1083
01:14:59,217 --> 01:14:59,974
Hi.

1084
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,466
How did your exams go?

1085
01:15:04,584 --> 01:15:05,443
Not bad.

1086
01:15:06,873 --> 01:15:08,966
I'm staying with Karthik now.

1087
01:15:10,991 --> 01:15:13,982
Come and talk to him once.

1088
01:15:14,709 --> 01:15:16,623
Okay. About what?

1089
01:15:17,803 --> 01:15:19,122
Apologize to him.

1090
01:15:19,794 --> 01:15:20,684
You want me to apologize?

1091
01:15:22,676 --> 01:15:26,052
When Karthik hits me, who
should be the one to apologize?

1092
01:15:26,998 --> 01:15:28,614
When you spoke with my
father the way you did...

1093
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:30,426
Who should be the one to apologize?

1094
01:15:30,521 --> 01:15:34,529
From the minute I walked in to your house
that day, all I did was apologize to him.

1095
01:15:35,692 --> 01:15:38,582
Your parents said mean things
about my parents and pushed me.

1096
01:15:39,012 --> 01:15:40,566
That was wrong. I agree.

1097
01:15:40,732 --> 01:15:42,966
But think about it from his perspective.

1098
01:15:44,013 --> 01:15:46,107
We made a mistake that exposed
us to the whole world.

1099
01:15:46,529 --> 01:15:48,184
We're at fault.

1100
01:15:48,958 --> 01:15:50,473
Why are you so arrogant anyway?

1101
01:15:51,184 --> 01:15:52,575
What have you achieved in life?

1102
01:15:53,981 --> 01:15:55,951
Even your job... you got it for me.

1103
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,709
That's how loose your motivation is.

1104
01:16:08,498 --> 01:16:09,231
Here.

1105
01:16:10,302 --> 01:16:11,653
I cracked this job for you, right?

1106
01:16:13,834 --> 01:16:14,708
I don't need it.

1107
01:16:30,349 --> 01:16:31,075
Siddhu...

1108
01:16:32,825 --> 01:16:34,794
Meghana's mother cancelled the wedding.

1109
01:16:37,599 --> 01:16:41,294
I came to discuss the same with you.

1110
01:16:42,928 --> 01:16:47,279
But obviously, I expected a
little too much from you.

1111
01:17:03,467 --> 01:17:05,099
We're not right for each other, Siddhu.

1112
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,357
We can't be together with
all these differences.

1113
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:15,427
Bye.

1114
01:17:29,553 --> 01:17:32,060
['Raavoi Chandamama' song playing]

1115
01:18:58,735 --> 01:19:02,829
Two things. Number one...
She doesn't belong from our family.

1116
01:19:03,821 --> 01:19:04,900
You're a journalist.

1117
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:06,454
Get your facts right.

1118
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,204
And number two...

1119
01:19:10,049 --> 01:19:11,877
Isn't this a professional interview?

1120
01:19:12,516 --> 01:19:14,117
Aren't your questions out of place?

1121
01:19:17,478 --> 01:19:19,673
Now do you see why I had
to cancel the wedding?

1122
01:19:20,361 --> 01:19:22,361
We live in the age of Internet. Meghana.

1123
01:19:22,877 --> 01:19:25,337
Our entire life is an open book.

1124
01:19:26,571 --> 01:19:27,571
You'll hate me now.

1125
01:19:28,251 --> 01:19:29,929
But one day you'll come and thank me.

1126
01:19:29,954 --> 01:19:32,236
['Raavoi Chandamama'
song continues playing]

1127
01:19:37,086 --> 01:19:39,727
I waited for your mom outside the
conference hall for 2 hours.

1128
01:19:39,954 --> 01:19:42,204
But she didn't even spare 2 minutes for me.

1129
01:19:42,790 --> 01:19:45,087
What do you want me to do now?
Fall at your mom's feet?

1130
01:19:45,383 --> 01:19:47,977
If you don't intend on fixing
this situation, just say it.

1131
01:19:48,586 --> 01:19:50,023
You don't have to do me a favor.

1132
01:19:50,954 --> 01:19:51,734
Meghana...

1133
01:19:51,985 --> 01:19:53,032
Don't be silly.

1134
01:19:53,791 --> 01:19:54,728
Silly, huh?

1135
01:20:32,837 --> 01:20:33,579
Pick up.

1136
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:40,891
Siddhu... How are you, man?

1137
01:20:42,477 --> 01:20:43,985
Ask me how I'm doing.

1138
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:55,141
Listen...
-Don't you dare hang up on me.

1139
01:20:56,009 --> 01:20:58,133
Hear me out or I'll be
at your doorstep next.

1140
01:21:02,278 --> 01:21:04,067
How long since you and Vineetha
have been together? A year?

1141
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,235
Mine was 6 years.

1142
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:10,071
I had to go to great lengths
to finally get engaged.

1143
01:21:11,883 --> 01:21:14,676
Do you even understand the
process behind getting married?

1144
01:21:15,509 --> 01:21:17,161
You need to literally
beg the girl's parents.

1145
01:21:17,486 --> 01:21:19,798
Convince them that you'd
take good care of her.

1146
01:21:20,259 --> 01:21:23,543
First you need to be sure whether you
can look after her, you asshole!

1147
01:21:23,892 --> 01:21:26,704
Karthik, I...
-Don't talk.

1148
01:21:29,829 --> 01:21:31,930
I was so friendly with you, man.

1149
01:21:32,727 --> 01:21:34,649
We also had drinks together.

1150
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:41,657
Why did you come into my life, Siddhu?

1151
01:21:42,351 --> 01:21:43,538
The villain of my life!

1152
01:21:46,391 --> 01:21:47,754
How do you sleep at night?

1153
01:21:52,884 --> 01:21:55,118
Bro, you should never cross the line.

1154
01:21:55,282 --> 01:21:56,585
But you went ahead and shat all over it.

1155
01:21:56,618 --> 01:21:59,743
I know she shouldn't be messed
with and I don't even know the full story.

1156
01:22:00,196 --> 01:22:02,997
If she thought our marriage was
a mistake, why did she agree to it?

1157
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:04,633
Because she didn't know you're a fool.

1158
01:22:05,552 --> 01:22:07,770
The basic difference between
you and Vineetha is...

1159
01:22:07,795 --> 01:22:10,490
She's still doing her job.
-Fuck it, sir! Fuck it!

1160
01:22:11,231 --> 01:22:13,434
I'd rather get drunk than
see her at work every day.

1161
01:22:13,497 --> 01:22:15,770
I don't speak your slang, man.

1162
01:22:15,795 --> 01:22:16,411
Save it.

1163
01:22:16,436 --> 01:22:17,411
What should I do, sir?

1164
01:22:17,669 --> 01:22:18,465
What should I do?

1165
01:22:19,583 --> 01:22:20,740
Should I touch her feet?

1166
01:22:24,161 --> 01:22:24,918
Listen...

1167
01:22:25,333 --> 01:22:28,020
I understand that you're
in pain and frustration.

1168
01:22:28,792 --> 01:22:30,847
Above all, you have a big ego.

1169
01:22:31,082 --> 01:22:33,942
Instead of banging vessels on
the floor when you're angry...

1170
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,379
Cook something in them.

1171
01:22:35,997 --> 01:22:37,379
It's called therapy.

1172
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:42,129
Pavan, who was that director
whose movie came out recently?

1173
01:22:43,286 --> 01:22:44,200
Christopher Nolan, sir.

1174
01:22:44,629 --> 01:22:45,957
You know Christopher Nolan?

1175
01:22:46,106 --> 01:22:50,223
He made a film on a different planet
for 5 years called 'Interstellar'.

1176
01:22:51,145 --> 01:22:53,855
And you're still roaming
around in Chilakalaguda.

1177
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,629
What else do you want me to do, sir?

1178
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:03,325
My problem is, I put her above myself.

1179
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,465
That's my problem.

1180
01:23:05,544 --> 01:23:06,504
That is why it came to this.

1181
01:23:12,231 --> 01:23:14,864
I should just jump off of some building.

1182
01:23:22,278 --> 01:23:24,239
Why do you think I'm
listening to your story?

1183
01:23:26,973 --> 01:23:28,340
I had a son who looked just like you.

1184
01:23:28,919 --> 01:23:30,543
In fact, he was 2 inches taller.

1185
01:23:31,638 --> 01:23:32,957
He was an amazing football player.

1186
01:23:34,215 --> 01:23:36,152
Goalkeepers would shit their pants.

1187
01:23:37,989 --> 01:23:38,997
But it was all for nothing.

1188
01:23:39,778 --> 01:23:41,715
He failed in love and committed suicide.

1189
01:23:48,379 --> 01:23:50,230
I had to perform his final rites.

1190
01:23:52,668 --> 01:23:54,262
No one can solve your problem.

1191
01:23:56,145 --> 01:23:57,199
Want to know why?

1192
01:23:58,386 --> 01:23:59,355
Your problem is...

1193
01:24:00,883 --> 01:24:01,872
yourself.

1194
01:24:06,121 --> 01:24:07,161
We're done here, guys.

1195
01:24:15,145 --> 01:24:16,770
Where the hell were you?
Are you out of your mind?

1196
01:24:16,795 --> 01:24:18,067
I saw the cops and ran!

1197
01:24:18,122 --> 01:24:21,372
Bastard! Let's get out of here.
-Did something go wrong?

1198
01:24:30,855 --> 01:24:32,355
Why doesn't she pick up?
-Who?

1199
01:24:32,505 --> 01:24:33,543
Meghana's mom.

1200
01:24:34,598 --> 01:24:37,317
You're not some big shot
that she'd answer your call.

1201
01:24:38,043 --> 01:24:40,465
What the hell are we doing
out here anyway? Let's go.

1202
01:24:40,489 --> 01:24:42,848
You can leave if you have to.
I can handle it by myself.

1203
01:24:43,130 --> 01:24:44,801
I don't need you here. Go.

1204
01:24:50,465 --> 01:24:52,848
You tag me along on all your cheap tricks.

1205
01:24:53,559 --> 01:24:55,918
And then you dominate me.
Your ego gets in the way, huh?

1206
01:24:57,614 --> 01:24:59,137
Don't call me next time.

1207
01:24:59,286 --> 01:25:00,067
I'm not going to come.

1208
01:26:20,411 --> 01:26:21,567
Karthik got fed up trying.

1209
01:26:21,686 --> 01:26:23,686
Thank you, ma'am.
-Now it's you.

1210
01:26:24,792 --> 01:26:29,268
Aunty, listen...
-Siddhu, this is my workplace.

1211
01:26:30,244 --> 01:26:32,095
You guys should stop troubling me.

1212
01:26:33,159 --> 01:26:34,448
I won't listen to you...

1213
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:37,329
get all emotional...

1214
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:40,455
and change my decision.

1215
01:26:42,065 --> 01:26:44,932
Got it?
-But Meghana is...

1216
01:26:46,525 --> 01:26:48,056
Have some coffee before you leave.

1217
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:02,252
Bro! Bro! Bro!

1218
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:05,057
Bro, please!

1219
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:08,096
Please, bro.

1220
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:17,221
Shit!

1221
01:27:18,745 --> 01:27:19,510
Damn!

1222
01:27:25,589 --> 01:27:26,596
I'm sorry.

1223
01:27:32,002 --> 01:27:32,846
What happened?

1224
01:27:34,714 --> 01:27:38,448
Dad, do you and mom fight anytime?
-So many times.

1225
01:27:38,626 --> 01:27:41,071
Do you apologize even
when it's mom's fault?

1226
01:27:41,253 --> 01:27:43,940
Who is to decide between right and wrong?

1227
01:27:44,823 --> 01:27:46,901
The way you're drinking
with me right now...

1228
01:27:46,952 --> 01:27:48,315
It's wrong according to your mom.

1229
01:27:50,448 --> 01:27:51,526
But I'm okay with it.

1230
01:27:51,894 --> 01:27:52,815
Because...

1231
01:27:53,284 --> 01:27:55,611
Here, you stop at two drinks.

1232
01:27:56,253 --> 01:27:58,354
But then outside, there's no keeping tabs.

1233
01:27:59,009 --> 01:28:01,431
Right and wrong is only a perception.

1234
01:28:07,814 --> 01:28:09,673
Okay. I made a mistake.

1235
01:28:10,393 --> 01:28:11,799
I agree. I'm sorry.

1236
01:28:12,456 --> 01:28:14,947
But I wasn't alone in this.
-Everybody makes mistakes.

1237
01:28:15,698 --> 01:28:21,268
No one has a problem with
someone's positive side.

1238
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:26,987
Living with a person means
living with his/her weaknesses.

1239
01:28:33,557 --> 01:28:36,541
Let's forget about you and
Vineetha for a second.

1240
01:28:36,839 --> 01:28:39,119
Karthik and Meghana are
deeply hurt because of this.

1241
01:28:39,589 --> 01:28:43,003
I tried talking to Meghana's
mother 'n' number of times.

1242
01:28:43,892 --> 01:28:46,901
She will not speak. Their problem
will not be solved. -Of course!

1243
01:28:47,636 --> 01:28:48,573
Why would it?

1244
01:28:50,596 --> 01:28:52,509
Right now your motivation is...

1245
01:28:53,691 --> 01:28:55,276
If you solve their problem...

1246
01:28:56,448 --> 01:28:58,409
Your problem with Vineetha goes away.

1247
01:29:00,987 --> 01:29:02,479
Where's your honesty in that?

1248
01:29:06,113 --> 01:29:09,097
Because you caused the problem, solve it.

1249
01:29:09,331 --> 01:29:10,643
Take responsibility.

1250
01:29:13,652 --> 01:29:15,714
Don't do it for yourself.
Do it for them.

1251
01:29:25,995 --> 01:29:26,956
And Siddhu, listen.

1252
01:29:27,823 --> 01:29:29,182
What's with the puppy face?

1253
01:29:29,793 --> 01:29:30,940
Be a man.

1254
01:29:31,557 --> 01:29:33,635
Widen your chest.
It's not the end of the world.

1255
01:31:05,358 --> 01:31:06,131
Hi.

1256
01:31:08,084 --> 01:31:09,068
My name is Siddhu.

1257
01:31:10,873 --> 01:31:13,310
Almost 3-4 months back...

1258
01:31:13,373 --> 01:31:15,781
So many of you watched
me and my girlfriend...

1259
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,116
You watched me and my
ex-girlfriend get married.

1260
01:31:21,773 --> 01:31:23,773
Some of you said it was fun.

1261
01:31:24,202 --> 01:31:25,351
While some of you hated it.

1262
01:31:25,867 --> 01:31:28,006
Said it was offensive towards women.

1263
01:31:28,686 --> 01:31:30,117
That we insulted our culture.

1264
01:31:31,461 --> 01:31:34,351
I can't function without a
cup of coffee every morning.

1265
01:31:34,984 --> 01:31:37,086
That's how common and
average of a guy I am.

1266
01:31:38,109 --> 01:31:40,218
What would I hold against anyone?

1267
01:31:40,789 --> 01:31:41,703
Why would I?

1268
01:31:45,664 --> 01:31:46,492
Dad...

1269
01:31:46,984 --> 01:31:47,867
I'm really sorry.

1270
01:31:48,601 --> 01:31:50,327
This is my fault. Not yours.

1271
01:31:52,038 --> 01:31:53,413
You don't deserve a son like me.

1272
01:31:54,586 --> 01:31:56,625
But every son deserves a father like you.

1273
01:32:00,156 --> 01:32:03,179
All of you must've moved
on from this video.

1274
01:32:05,538 --> 01:32:07,725
I don't know. Maybe to a new viral video.

1275
01:32:07,867 --> 01:32:09,859
Bigg Boss or something else.

1276
01:32:12,172 --> 01:32:14,382
But we're still stuck in the same moment.

1277
01:32:16,109 --> 01:32:20,742
This video ruined the lives of two
people who had nothing to do with it.

1278
01:32:23,664 --> 01:32:26,609
It's not fair that they
have to suffer the wrath.

1279
01:32:33,898 --> 01:32:39,445
I got married in a hurry to prove
how much I love my girlfriend.

1280
01:32:40,625 --> 01:32:42,499
This situation is a consequence of that.

1281
01:32:47,086 --> 01:32:48,945
If that video hadn't been uploaded...

1282
01:32:49,304 --> 01:32:51,608
We wouldn't have captured the most
beautiful moment in our lives.

1283
01:32:53,445 --> 01:32:55,335
We had a few drinks to
celebrate that feeling.

1284
01:32:57,969 --> 01:32:59,328
Some guy said, 'Want me to rape her?'

1285
01:33:05,367 --> 01:33:08,992
And some of the nasty comments
some of you posted...

1286
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:18,070
She might be the college topper.
You never know.

1287
01:33:20,922 --> 01:33:22,781
Maybe she did everything right in her life.

1288
01:33:24,859 --> 01:33:25,945
Her only mistake was...

1289
01:33:28,093 --> 01:33:29,539
Choosing to love me.

1290
01:33:35,281 --> 01:33:38,312
Everyone says this is our fault.

1291
01:33:39,554 --> 01:33:40,781
But think about it.

1292
01:33:42,266 --> 01:33:43,164
Think about our pain.

1293
01:33:48,055 --> 01:33:52,023
To everyone who got offended and
hurt by watching this video...

1294
01:33:52,179 --> 01:33:54,015
I'm really sorry.

1295
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:59,093
And I'm sorry only
about the video going live.

1296
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:02,022
Not sorry about marrying her.

1297
01:34:04,952 --> 01:34:07,337
I'm very proud to have married
a girl like Vineetha.

1298
01:34:08,631 --> 01:34:11,134
I married her once.
And I'd marry her another hundred times.

1299
01:34:44,241 --> 01:34:45,827
How many people watched this video?

1300
01:34:46,242 --> 01:34:47,874
3,000-4,000 views, ma'am.

1301
01:34:48,344 --> 01:34:49,289
Very less.

1302
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,320
And the other video?
-Almost 7 million people, ma'am.

1303
01:34:56,187 --> 01:34:57,421
That's funny, right?

1304
01:34:59,836 --> 01:35:00,562
Alright.

1305
01:35:01,515 --> 01:35:06,241
Call our PRO Prabhu and ask him to
boost the video as much as he can.

1306
01:35:06,703 --> 01:35:09,546
I want everyone to watch
it in the next 2 weeks.

1307
01:35:12,178 --> 01:35:13,397
Out!
-Okay, ma'am.

1308
01:35:23,765 --> 01:35:24,460
And then?

1309
01:35:24,952 --> 01:35:26,952
Did Vineetha send divorce papers?

1310
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:30,476
No, sir.

1311
01:35:33,047 --> 01:35:36,031
One day, her father dropped by and
invited us to Karthik's wedding.

1312
01:36:00,576 --> 01:36:03,365
Mom, Siddhu is standing and eating. Look.

1313
01:36:03,615 --> 01:36:07,099
Siddhu, did you try the pickle?
-I'm good, aunty.

1314
01:36:07,124 --> 01:36:08,779
Why doesn't he just sit down, aunty?

1315
01:36:08,804 --> 01:36:10,310
He's like that. Let him be.

1316
01:36:11,412 --> 01:36:12,075
Hi.

1317
01:36:13,272 --> 01:36:14,099
Hi.

1318
01:36:20,630 --> 01:36:22,373
Catering is...
-Siddhu.

1319
01:36:24,333 --> 01:36:25,731
Vineetha is upstairs.

1320
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:27,646
Oh.

1321
01:36:30,013 --> 01:36:30,623
Give.

1322
01:36:30,648 --> 01:36:32,345
No. It's okay.
-Come on, give.

1323
01:36:40,365 --> 01:36:41,966
Uncle...
-Hmm?

1324
01:36:43,248 --> 01:36:44,849
I'm really sorry, uncle.

1325
01:36:45,217 --> 01:36:46,107
That's okay.

1326
01:36:46,553 --> 01:36:47,662
Still, I'm sorry.

1327
01:36:51,928 --> 01:36:54,177
So, what happened with him?
-Your boy...

1328
01:36:55,084 --> 01:36:56,498
just turned into a man.

1329
01:36:56,912 --> 01:36:57,654
Really?

1330
01:37:03,123 --> 01:37:04,419
I don't think so.

1331
01:37:07,224 --> 01:37:07,951
What?

1332
01:37:09,225 --> 01:37:11,755
Vineetha's mom asked for you.
Quick. It's urgent.

1333
01:37:12,389 --> 01:37:14,873
Go.
-Vineetha, I'm going downstairs. Come fast.

1334
01:37:24,592 --> 01:37:26,295
Hi.
-Hi.

1335
01:37:28,419 --> 01:37:31,614
Your dad dropped by and invited me.
-Hmm? Okay.

1336
01:37:33,622 --> 01:37:34,723
You sent him, didn't you?

1337
01:37:34,832 --> 01:37:36,520
Maybe.
-Maybe?

1338
01:37:38,451 --> 01:37:41,107
What if my dad didn't come?
-I would've waited.

1339
01:37:41,132 --> 01:37:43,334
How long?
-Till you texted me.

1340
01:37:45,287 --> 01:37:47,561
Because... I love you.

1341
01:37:55,865 --> 01:37:56,614
Good.

1342
01:37:58,490 --> 01:37:59,340
Come in.

1343
01:38:00,762 --> 01:38:02,230
And shut the door behind you.

1344
01:38:06,708 --> 01:38:07,559
Okay.

1345
01:38:24,411 --> 01:38:26,411
He always skips at the right moment.

1346
01:38:26,436 --> 01:38:27,709
What happened next, bro?

1347
01:38:27,959 --> 01:38:29,068
I'll break your bones!
-I'll break your bones!

1348
01:38:33,873 --> 01:38:36,592
It's all good, right?
Why are you back here?

1349
01:38:37,029 --> 01:38:37,826
Come on, sir.

1350
01:38:38,145 --> 01:38:40,270
I thought we'd go out
and have a few drinks.

1351
01:38:41,654 --> 01:38:42,481
Oh, is it?

1352
01:38:44,427 --> 01:38:45,130
What say/

1353
01:38:45,155 --> 01:38:46,631
Let's go, bro.
-Bro?

1354
01:38:46,834 --> 01:38:48,248
I'll smack you naked.

1355
01:38:49,928 --> 01:38:52,419
Hey! How's the Malakpet
bike case coming along?

1356
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:54,826
We didn't find the bike, sir.
-You never will. Let's go.

1357
01:38:55,022 --> 01:38:56,568
Sir... Sir... Hold on.

1358
01:38:57,841 --> 01:38:59,412
I have a small surprise for you both.

1359
01:39:07,591 --> 01:39:08,411
Hi!

1360
01:39:08,732 --> 01:39:09,497
Come.

1361
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:11,128
Your wife?
-Yes, sir.

1362
01:39:11,872 --> 01:39:12,880
Hello.
-Hello.

1363
01:39:14,419 --> 01:39:17,526
Hello. I'm Fish Venkat.
-Of course! I've seen you in movies.

1364
01:39:17,551 --> 01:39:19,239
Very nice to meet you.
-Don't flatter yourself. Sit down.

1365
01:39:19,278 --> 01:39:20,411
Please sit.

1366
01:39:30,348 --> 01:39:32,833
Siddhu is always talking about you.

1367
01:39:32,965 --> 01:39:34,145
Really?
-Yeah.

1368
01:39:34,644 --> 01:39:36,800
But he never told me about you.

1369
01:39:37,278 --> 01:39:39,473
Oh, yeah?
But I've heard a lot about you.

1370
01:39:43,847 --> 01:39:44,760
What did he tell you?

1371
01:39:45,887 --> 01:39:47,457
Everything. Top to bottom.

1372
01:39:48,371 --> 01:39:50,089
Everything? Top to bottom?

1373
01:39:53,575 --> 01:39:57,676
So you're telling everyone
about our personal life?

1374
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:01,425
I was just sharing, you know.

1375
01:40:01,450 --> 01:40:05,723
We all went viral. So you say anything
you want to? -They know everything.

1376
01:40:05,754 --> 01:40:08,668
What's the big deal? -Why did you
tell them if they already knew?

1377
01:40:08,693 --> 01:40:12,161
Were you exaggerating about me?
-We were just talking.

1378
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:18,715
What the hell, man.
It's wife-husband drama all over again!
