1
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:09,769
That's it?

2
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,533
What do you mean?

3
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,075
Is that enough?

4
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,417
Did you have a recording?

5
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,551
No I have one now!

6
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,310
Then why did you come here?

7
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:28,754
Why not!

8
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,383
At least I get to
see your face!

9
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:32,691
Keep looking'

10
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,589
Are you coming?
Come soon

11
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,762
Come..

12
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:51,510
Sweetheart I'll get late

13
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,278
You don't have a booking!

14
00:01:59,252 --> 00:01:59,911
Stop honking!

15
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,153
Idiot!

16
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,482
Have you ever missed
a single Friday?

17
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,735
Stop the car David..

18
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,535
Stop the car please.
Park it on the side.

19
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:25,468
Keep going..

20
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,443
Park it outside

21
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,634
Where is everybody?

22
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,099
What happened to you?

23
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:22,324
What did you think? Kapoor
a businessman can't be creative?

24
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,635
This round is mine Ranjeet!
Your talent was a flop!

25
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:33,709
Prepare for the next round!

26
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:35,843
Will have to search..

27
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,880
You feel there is a dearth
of talent in India?

28
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,215
There's no dearth

29
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,550
You need someone
to find them.

30
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:42,880
Will get someone..will
get someone..

31
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,262
Can I get a window seat?

32
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,369
Go look for yourself

33
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,449
Excuse me..
do you mind sitting here?

34
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:23,493
I get very restless
without a window seat

35
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,722
..and there's no empty
window seat on the bus.

36
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,397
Please come.

37
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,665
Sir do you mind pulling
your seat ahead?

38
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,427
Sir why don't you push
your seat behind?

39
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,598
What do you mean..!?

40
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,663
Are you going to Pune?

41
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,133
This bus goes only up to Pune

42
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,410
I go once in every three
months to Pune.

43
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:18,546
The weather in Pune is
much better than Mumbai

44
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,311
especially for the body and mind.

45
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,685
And for artistes like me
it's very important.

46
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,054
Do not ask me how..

47
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,126
I passed the night away..

48
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,455
Do not ask me how..

49
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,259
I passed the night away..

50
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:04,091
Take a look..

51
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:05,527
Open it

52
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,055
Go on.. Take a look

53
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,803
I'll show you.. See this

54
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,565
All India District Level
Singing Festival

55
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:17,835
My first gold medal.

56
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,700
It was also my first
stage performance.

57
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,371
I got a gold medal.

58
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,344
I was only thirteen!

59
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,776
As soon as I stepped into
High School another achievement..

60
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:29,284
Let's go further..

61
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,722
I wasn't even employed since
then I have been doing Stage shows!

62
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,227
Are you a singer?

63
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,527
Well I don't like to
call myself that..

64
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,063
sounds like a sewing machine brand.

65
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,258
"Okay, okay.."

66
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,063
I am a vocalist and I
Have surrendered ..

67
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,330
..my life to the service of music.

68
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,065
Well I don't have any
guru as such but

69
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,506
I consider Naushad saab as my guru'

70
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:52,606
Sachin Dev Burman saab'

71
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,638
Shankar Jaikishan saab.. Khhayyam
saab..

72
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,743
And in today's generation..AR
Rehman..

73
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,750
Man is a voyager..

74
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,026
He comes and he goes'

75
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,297
On the road that he travels..

76
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,195
He leaves behind memories..

77
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,366
Are you getting it?
- What?

78
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,573
Network! - What?

79
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,452
In this journey of life..

80
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,487
travelers meet to get separated'

81
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,394
Leaving behind memories..

82
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:47,298
that plague them in solitude'

83
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,028
Who..

84
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:25,034
Ever belonged..

85
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,298
To anybody here..

86
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:40,446
Who ever belonged to anybody here..

87
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,118
Here..

88
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,311
Along with it the road took me'

89
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,750
Leaving behind my sky'

90
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,619
I met you again on these roads'

91
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,189
I wanted to tell you something..

92
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:24,656
But I didn't say a word'

93
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,095
Leave..

94
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,562
You had to leave'

95
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,636
To a place where you belong
to yourself'

96
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,034
Who..

97
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,043
ever belonged..

98
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,546
to anybody here..

99
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,047
Who ever belonged to anybody here..

100
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,600
My heart was mesmerized'

101
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,675
Everything stopped when
you touched'

102
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,073
But what's left are just scars
of memories'

103
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,147
Whatever I wished for..

104
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,750
It never happened'

105
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,155
Did not turn back and see..

106
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,428
Time just went by'

107
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,566
No no tell me..

108
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,099
Did not wait for anything..

109
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,092
At Spectral..

110
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,641
Mumbai Idol auditions are on..
you tell me..

111
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,574
Where is Jeet.

112
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,779
Come on it's only
Tuesday today!

113
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,650
Three more days to go you
don't worry!

114
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,797
Where are you from?
- I am from Jamshedpur sir.

115
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,133
Jamshedpur?
- Yes sir. - What do you do?

116
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,403
I am into theatre
and I also sing.

117
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:12,671
You sing too?

118
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,206
Please sing for me.

119
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:16,541
I will start from the verse.
- Sure.

120
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,073
It's an old song..

121
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,151
It's a story..

122
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,484
I do not remember'

123
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,620
Now that I think I
shall never forget'

124
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,830
The memories of that spring

125
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,101
Seasons come and go..

126
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,501
Giving false promises'

127
00:11:55,881 --> 00:12:01,217
And yet my mind is thirsty

128
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,482
At least leave the kids alone.

129
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:40,220
You are looking for your talent
that too outside my studio!

130
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,823
Admits the singers audition line up?

131
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,491
I was listening to her sing!

132
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,494
It's not fair to poke fun at
someone's talent.

133
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,224
I wasn't making fun of anyone!

134
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,660
The moment we walk in he'll say
Didn't I tell you to buy two!

135
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,339
How's everything?

136
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:28,473
Well going on

137
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,542
Didn't I tell you to buy two?!

138
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,345
You had to come again!

139
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,158
What do you think?

140
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,241
You should've taken a smaller
car for Sheetal.

141
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,712
There will be a fight at home.

142
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,049
It's the days of equality you know!

143
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,195
Will take at least a week

144
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,267
For your party?

145
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:46,083
I met this man on my way to Pune'

146
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,553
I was going there for
my dad's concert..

147
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,681
Ya ya he does he is into Classical

148
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,308
.. and his singing never stops

149
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,190
I'm telling you show your
devotion to Sehwag's strength

150
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,454
Sehwag's strength doesn't
last when it comes to Pakistan

151
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:35,060
Have you forgotten when
he hit a triple century..

152
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,397
..you all spent an entire
month rubbing balm on your backsides!

153
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,061
Oh did you forget when Shoaib
nailed everyone..

154
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,674
they were running around the
field like dogs!

155
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,070
Oh that was a fluke!

156
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,271
You are one big fluke wanna-be
singer!

157
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,149
Transvestite!

158
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,484
Nudist!

159
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,482
One who's naked can
see everyone naked!

160
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,084
Get lost!
- You get lost!

161
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:57,689
Boil in the ass!

162
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:58,823
Broken Tanpura!

163
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,216
Pardon me. He makes me swear.

164
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,156
It's ok Mr. Bhushan I'm used to it!

165
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,222
I am calling from Soundman
Industries'

166
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,229
I would like to speak with Mr.
Bharat Bhushan please

167
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,502
Yes this is Bharat Bhushan.

168
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:14,706
Yes Mr. Ranjeet Thadani

169
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,301
One of my friends met you a
Mr. Jagdeesh Varma

170
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,311
Yes on the way to Pune

171
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,439
He was all praises for you..

172
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,774
..and.. In fact I would
like to meet you

173
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,183
Can you come to my house for
dinner next Friday?

174
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:29,654
Next Friday dinner..

175
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,256
..Veg or Non-veg?

176
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,658
The thing is.. at our place we
do not eat Non-veg on Fridays..

177
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,621
When I called him for dinner
do you know what he asked me?

178
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:07,625
Sir Veg or Non-veg?..

179
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:17,702
You called only one?

180
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,701
You think one is not enough?
He's like ten!

181
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,786
Ranjeet what happened?

182
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,806
Sheetal!

183
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,219
Slowly

184
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,427
Where should I put the ice
pack? Left or right?

185
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:26,771
What happened to your phone?

186
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,106
Its gone!

187
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,706
I've been trying for so long!
- The phone's gone and so has my back!

188
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,445
Good you are back at home now'

189
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,114
did it happen at the same time?

190
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,332
You know I have a dinner to attend

191
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,129
Nothing will happen to me in
one hour I will be alright.

192
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,609
So don't talk to me then.

193
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,077
Why are you talking?

194
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,082
Ms Sushma.. Yes..

195
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,408
Can I tell you something..
- Go on..

196
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,085
I'm very nervous!

197
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,744
There's no reason for you to
be nervous Mr. Bhushan!

198
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:21,351
You know I've never been
invited to such a dinner before.

199
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:26,564
Really?
- Yes

200
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,502
Can you tell me something?
Go on

201
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,769
What do you think of
my new hair style?

202
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,376
No?

203
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,511
I felt similarly.

204
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,646
It's better to be simple.

205
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:42,780
Of course of course..

206
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,718
Don't be nervous..

207
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,219
But why did you call him here?

208
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,526
Just like that..

209
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,660
Let me see what Bharat Bhushan
is made off!

210
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,208
Half an hour early

211
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,225
He has a very important
dinner to attend.

212
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,629
No there's no dinner..

213
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,172
Oh ya! It's not a dinner..

214
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,498
Actually it's a talent
hunt party? Isn't it?

215
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:47,702
They call some idiot for dinner..

216
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:54,185
Is there a shortage of the
intelligent in India?

217
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,314
Calling some fool and
making fun of him..

218
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,117
They don't even know they are
being made fun of!

219
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,459
But you are aware of
it aren't you?!

220
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,535
Anyways I don't have
a cure for this

221
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,729
Unfortunately I don't
have one either!

222
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,080
Do you remember back in
college when we celebrated

223
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:27,685
rose days we used to make the
ugliest girl Rose Queen!

224
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,160
That I will know only after I go.

225
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,301
Sheetal!

226
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,657
Where do you manage to
meet such samples?

227
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,388
There's no shortage of talent
in India doctor

228
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:19,137
3rd LV or may be 4th LV
or may be 5th LV..

229
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,732
I think you should
cancel the dinner

230
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,675
Take some rest tonight I'll
come back tomorrow morning

231
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,685
By the way what
does your sample do?

232
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:47,425
You have called and I am away'

233
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,696
leave a message after the beep'.

234
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,638
I'll come back and return your call'

235
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,646
oh leave a message after the beep..

236
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:06,651

237
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,786
I am waiting for you.
Please come soon

238
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,528
Here 80 rupees..

239
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,388
Mr. Thadani's residence? Yes

240
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,133
I have been called.

241
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,664
This sample of yours is amazing!

242
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,143
I think he's come'

243
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,607
No you sit I'll receive him.

244
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,744
You take care of your back I'll
take care of him

245
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,586
The whole and soul of Soundman
Industries..

246
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,226
I know everything about
your company..

247
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,757
New age music Super hit Muqabale
Deewarien..

248
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,435
Your getting me wrong'

249
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,695
Actually my father was a very big
fan of Bharat Bhushan.

250
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:00,769
What?

251
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,766
Rani Rupmati was his first
romantic picture.

252
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,166
The actor -Bharat Bhushan's not
my father!

253
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,042
That is why he named
me Bharat Bhushan.

254
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,444
Yes. - I have inherited music.

255
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,117
That is why I feel I should
justify my name fully. - Yes

256
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:16,454
Have you heard that song?
- Which one?

257
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:20,180
Oh! Come back'.

258
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,320
Come back..

259
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,655
Come back..

260
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,335
Yes yes now please come in.

261
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,261
There is someone else who is
waiting to hear your song

262
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,535
I think you didn't
like my song

263
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,734
No it doesn't matter
if I like it or not.

264
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,207
It all depends on him..

265
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:42,806
Oh Ganpati!

266
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,081
It is your greatness
that you give credit

267
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,082
for your hard work
to Lord Ganesha

268
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,421
Lord Ganesha?

269
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,753
Please wait here I'll
be back in a minute

270
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:58,828
Your sample is remarkable!

271
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:01,265
I told you so!

272
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,557
By the way what does he do?

273
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,168
He's an officer
with the government.

274
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,237
You called an I.T.
guy to your house?

275
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,035
Not an I.T. guy an idiot doctor!

276
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,311
Softly.. He's standing right there..

277
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,649
And ya never invite me for a
dinner! I'll keep wondering!

278
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,329
Ranjeet take care of your back..

279
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,600
Ranjeet Thadani is waiting for you'

280
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,607
Oh I'm sorry I made you listen
to my story for no rhyme or reason!

281
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,277
It's okay!

282
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,678
How is his mood?

283
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:51,339
Well you sing something for him
everything will be okay!

284
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:00,355
Come in.. come in

285
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,423
I'm sorry I cannot stand up. My
back has betrayed me.

286
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,491
I think we will have to
cancel the dinner..

287
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,634
No its not a problem

288
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:10,768
If you have a life
the world is yours

289
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,702
We shall have fifty
more opportunities for a dinner

290
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,600
Yes but when will I get a
chance to have dinner with you?

291
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,502
You are embarrassing a worthless
one like me!

292
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,642
Whenever you call
me I'll be there.

293
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:25,650
T.G.I.F. means?

294
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:31,522
Are you coming?

295
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:38,462
And you talent?

296
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,791
He's right here in front of me.
- How is he? Winning horse?

297
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,125
You come here we'll
treat your back here!

298
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,082
So..

299
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,748
You've had formal training
in music or ..just like that?

300
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:07,020
Training is required by those who
don't have it in them.

301
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,355
Music flows through my veins.

302
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,228
Gandharva Mahavidyalay's foundation

303
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,693
happened right in front
of my father's eyes.

304
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,365
But because of some
economic pressures

305
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:15,760
he could not take
up admission there

306
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:17,761
he started working
there as a clerk.

307
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,237
Well forget it..

308
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,768
If my father wasn't a clerk in
Gandharva Mahavidyalay

309
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:27,771
I would have never
become a vocalist.

310
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,116
But I'd not only like to sing well
but listen to some good music too.

311
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,780
Not just the great singer
Tansen but Kansen too!

312
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,316
I carry mine along with me!

313
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,061
Mr. Bhushan today leave
aside the country ..

314
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,201
..stuff and have some
imported stuff.

315
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:51,595
You have got it all wrong

316
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,398
This sure is country stuff but
it's not liquor it's honey.

317
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,217
Enriches the throat.

318
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,755
I heard the message on your
answering machine.

319
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,752
You liked it?
- A lot!

320
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,159
I'll do one for you!

321
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,020
I have two
brilliant ideas.

322
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,761
Give it to me
- I don't want it.

323
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,503
You don't understand!

324
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,773
I'll show you one more
very good thing.

325
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,447
What is this?

326
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,318
My story expressed through the
words of music and songs.

327
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,259
I'll show you.

328
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:52,185
It is combined with
seven tunes..

329
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,461
..this Bharat Bhushan has sacrificed
his whole life in the way of music.

330
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,233
Mr. Bharat Bhushan
are you married?

331
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,060
I've walked alone
I will walk alone O ..

332
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,139
..fellow travelers
do not accompany me

333
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,274
So you haven't
been married yet.

334
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,270
Yes and no
- What do you mean yes and no'?

335
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:08,606
My wife deserted me.

336
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,281
That happens often

337
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,015
She went away with
that eunuch Nalla.

338
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,611
His name is Rajeev Bhalla

339
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,610
but we used to call
him Nalla Nalla.

340
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:17,755
Absolute fake he was.

341
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,021
He calls himself a singer but he

342
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,351
sings only those remix songs!

343
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:23,761
How could Indu'

344
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:25,629
Indu. - Your wife?

345
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:26,764
Yes she'll regret it.

346
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,163
Do you have this
Bhalla's number?

347
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,570
Why?

348
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,637
You want to listen to
those remixes? - No..

349
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:40,644
Oh he'll curdle everything up!

350
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:46,106
But its ok.. - I'll give you Nalla
I mean Rajeev Bhalla's number.

351
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:50,185
Then you'll realise who is
the real singer and who is fake!

352
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,646
You've felt bad Mr Bhushan..

353
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,189
No there is nothing
to feel bad about.

354
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,519
You are a connoisseur
of music right?

355
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:58,387
Tell me how many times does will
come' come in will come'?

356
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,258
That song from the film Mahal..

357
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,726
will come.. will come..'

358
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,138
How many times does it repeat?

359
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:13,344
Twenty eight times..

360
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:24,688
But what about your back?

361
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,346
Forget the back lets go!

362
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,558
- Let's go Lets go..

363
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,623
While I was walking'

364
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,829
I happened to meet somebody'

365
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,227
On the road'

366
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,091
Do you know in the film
Pakeeza the song walking walking'..

367
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,293
how many times the word walking'
has been used?

368
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,704
'walking walking' that's two..

369
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:47,103
That means the chorus itself has ..

370
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,181
Are you okay?

371
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:58,722
Should I call Pareshbhai?

372
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,049
He has magic in his hands.

373
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,327
There is no one in the
whole of Andheri ..

374
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:04,654
..who does a massage like he does.

375
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,721
My mother had a fall in the bathroom

376
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:08,199
for one month she was bed ridden..

377
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,333
but because of him within a day

378
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,467
she was walking like before!

379
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,067
You are underestimating Paresh bhai.

380
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,731
Look at yourself anything
can happen.

381
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,734
You can get paralysed you
can also die!

382
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,347
Pick up..

383
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:24,815
Pick up..

384
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,612
Pick me up not the phone you idiot!

385
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,161
Your message is very cold!

386
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,696
Its me Jeet.

387
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:40,757
I'm not coming home tonight

388
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:42,765
So don't try and look for me.

389
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,827
And my phone is switched off

390
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:49,437
In fact Jeet I don't
want to come home ever.

391
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:02,185
I think I should go now

392
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,194
I understand what you
are going through

393
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,395
I am not going through anything!

394
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,388
I just want to be alone for a while.

395
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:15,532
I said the same thing..

396
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:17,791
when Indu left me two years ago.

397
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:20,133
I want be be alone'.

398
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,273
Since two years I have
been living alone in suffocation.

399
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,805
See Sheetal is angry now okay.

400
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,808
Once she cools down she'll
come back home.

401
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:27,669
You please go home now.

402
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:33,809
Should I call Paresh bhai?

403
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:38,822
Ok call..

404
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,827
The number is in the phone book

405
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,167
This one?

406
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:55,639
Got it?

407
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:57,574
Yes got it..

408
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,108
I got it.

409
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,447
I'm calling from Ranjeet
Thadani's residence.

410
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:11,588
Who's speaking?

411
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:17,528
What happened?

412
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,264
It's some lady doctor.

413
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,656
He's writhing in pain
he can't even move!

414
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,269
Whom are you talking to?

415
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:26,596
And his wife is also not here too!

416
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:27,805
Where has his wife gone?

417
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,206
She left him

418
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,474
Left him?

419
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:31,675
What do you mean by 'left him?'

420
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,678
Both his back and his
heart are broken.

421
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,217
It's some doctor Suman Rao.

422
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,823
Hang up!

423
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,152
I'm sorry I think I dialed the
wrong number by mistake.

424
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,162
What happened to Ranjeet?

425
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,297
Hang up Please!

426
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,567
Hang up!

427
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,634
She said she's coming
and hung up.

428
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:01,772
Are you mad?!

429
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,107
Why did you call Suman Rao?

430
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,167
I made a mistake. Suman and Shephard
were on the same page!

431
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,311
Don't you know how to read!

432
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,445
On the same page' it seems!
- But both of them are doctors.

433
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,103
..what difference does it make?

434
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,651
What kind of doctors are
nymphomaniacs?

435
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,117
They are not doctors but
patients..

436
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,657
They are sick they are mad..

437
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,126
They are wantons! Got it?

438
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,323
Now what should we do?
- Call her back.

439
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,062
Tell her Sheetal is back..

440
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,200
my back is alright..

441
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,335
There's no need to come.

442
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,203
That should be fine.

443
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,531
I'll sit next to you
and call her up.

444
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,420
Ms Suman I am Bharat Bhushan

445
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:53,824

Nothing's happened. Everything is
alright under control.

447
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:00,096
His wife is back and
his back is alright.

448
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,424
And he is walking comfortably.
There's no need to worry.

449
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,358
Anyways worry is like
a funeral pyre!

450
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:05,695
Enough
- Chitra means?

451
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,237
Funeral Pyre

452
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,572
Hang up!

453
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,301
No I'm a singer.

454
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,237
Well songs and philosophy have
a very old relationship! -

455
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:15,637
What do you sing?

456
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,039

Anything will do - Okay here

460
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:28,053
your sorrows are mine..

461
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,659
Mr. Bhushan she doesn't want to
listen to your songs!

462
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,660
my joys are yours..

463
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,730
Hang up please! She
is asking me to sing!

464
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:38,062
those eyes of yours..

465
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,062
The moon and the
sun are mine..

466
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,672
Please hang up!

467
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,277
Hang up now!!

00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,737
See I have to go now..

469
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,483
I can't leave him alone in
this state. He's in a lot of pain.

470
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,617
Alone?

471
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,081
You just said..

472
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,411
that his wife was back home?

473
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,622
His wife..

474
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,553
She's right here..
she's just gone out to put the garbage.

475
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,091
What nonsense are you talking?
- One has to put the garbage away

476
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,627
The cleanliness of the
nation starts with the house..

477
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,098
You're lying!

478
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,699
Excuse me I never lie.

479
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,632
I am a Libran and Libran's
do not lie.

480
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:14,365
Mahatma Gandhi was a Libran too.

481
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:15,765
2nd October Gandhi's
birth anniversary

482
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,107
I'm coming right away!

483
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,708
I'm coming right now she
said that and hung up.

484
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:53,810
Whom are you trying to deceive?

485
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,145
Yourself?

486
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:02,619
Talk clearly.. whatever
you want to say.

487
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,212
She's not coming back..

488
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,770
You're still here! You
haven't left yet!

489
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:34,785
No..

490
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,729
How long will you rest like this?

491
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,460
Can I put you somewhere else?

492
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:56,673
Come..

493
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,276
Absolutely

494
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,081
They all are the same.

495
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:06,479
Change colours like chameleons!

496
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:14,224
I heard your conversation.

497
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,024
She's left you and gone?

498
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,293
This Anant.. was he your friend?

499
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:08,201
When you asked me about my wife
I told you everything

500
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,337
right up to the name of that
& Nalla.

501
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,158
Anant was my friend

502
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,227
What do you mean was'?

503
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:27,161
We had a fight about two years ago

504
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,493
He was hitting on your wife?

505
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,162
I stole Sheetal from him.

506
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:38,442
I didn't understand.

507
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,241
He came to me with
an idea of an album

508
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,442
to launch a new singer.

509
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:51,455
I didn't take the album..

510
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,647
I took the singer Sheetal

511
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,462
Now I get it one button
but two holes?

512
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,131
I thought you got the whole shirt.

513
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:04,668
Why don't you call him?

514
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:06,470
What do I ask him?

515
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:07,797
Ask him for your shirt back!

516
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:10,340
That's what I told Nalla!

517
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,472
I asked him if he had my shirt..

518
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,474
He said I don't have your shirt
but I have your wife and he hung up.

519
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,412
..two years ago I stole
your wife did you steal her back?

520
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,153
Should I call?

521
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,218
I'll say I'm a friend
of Mrs Thadani

522
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,414
I just want to talk to
her for two minutes.

523
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,096
As you wish

524
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,302
Yes.

525
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,562
Will you do as I tell you?

526
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,701
I will only do what I'm told!

527
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,501
Sometimes I feel you think I'm an idiot!

528
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,435
So you call him and tell him you
are a film producer..

529
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:52,112
and you want the rights to his
album Jantar Mantar'

530
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,115
Pass me the phone

531
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,117
While talking you ask
him about the singer.

532
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,255
Now what does the singer have to

533
00:40:58,422 --> 00:40:59,389
Do with the rights of the album?

534
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,186
Please go ahead..

535
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,465
So you tell him you want rights

536
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:26,076
to all the songs in Jantar Mantar

537
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,217
All songs of Jantar Mantar'

538
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:28,612
By the way how are
the all the songs?

539
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,343
Very bad Mr. Bhushan ..

540
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,683
Mr. Thadani if the
songs are very bad

541
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,357
what is the point of
taking rights to such songs?

542
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:36,493
If you want to buy the rights why

543
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,093
don't you try Madan Mohan's songs?

544
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,693
Of course not!

545
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,627
Do you really want the
rights to the album?

546
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,561
You're right..

547
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:50,571
when I don't want the rights why
simply waste time!

548
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:51,708
Lets not call him!

549
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:55,779
Now who is Sheetal?

550
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:07,180
Give me the phone I'll
dial the number

551
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,592
This is going to be fun!

552
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,183
Don't mess it up now

553
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:11,519
Can I change my voice and talk?

554
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,662
No need!

555
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,323
His name is Anant..Anant Ghoshal

556
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:16,056
Don't you worry..

557
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,200
Anant's end is near!

558
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,063

all information..

00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,104

571
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,103

572
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,569

I know its you Toto

576
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,578
Mr. Ghoshal you have got me wrong

577
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,048
I am telling the truth..

578
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,652

Each and every one of them

585
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,405
Have you heard the songs?

586
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,540
If I hadn't heard them would
I be calling you?

587
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:31,675
What nonsense are you talking?

588
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:33,070
Movie or TV?

589
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,210

591
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:41,344
On whom will the songs
be picturised?

592
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,084

If you want I can narrate it
to you right now

598
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,699
No no not now..

599
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,034
Ask him about Sheetal..

600
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,046
I mean Madan Gopal Mohan

601
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:15,044

602
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:26,127
All the rights are ours Mr. Thadani!

603
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:30,266
And Sheetal?

604
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,470
My wife?

605
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,064
What happened to your wife?

606
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:43,068
You didn't ask him about
my wife at all!

607
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,077
I'll call again and say I want..

608
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:49,617
the contact number of
the singer Sheetal.

609
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:53,416
Mr. Thadani our goal is very near .

610
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,557
please don't be stubborn.

611
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,621
I'm being stubborn? Am I the idiot?

612
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:11,241
It was some Gopal Mohan' I've
never heard of him

613
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,035
One minute..

614
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:20,648
I'm Madan Mohan speaking.

615
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:22,046
Yes Mr. Madan Mohan.

616
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,120
It's not a problem..

617
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:26,051
actually I'm on another call.

618
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,588
Can I call you back?

619
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:29,125
Can I have your number?

620
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:30,260
Yes.. Please write

621
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,130
Strange! He cut the call!

622
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:35,265
I cut it. Are you mad!

623
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,267
You gave him my number!

624
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,331
He said he'll call back.

625
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:41,471
Your head is full of shit?!

626
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,537
It's music sir not shit!

627
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,403
Didn't I tell you he'll call back.

628
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,269
You should get an award for this!

629
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:50,272
Why are you not answering? It's
Anant on the line.

630
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:52,615
Didn't I tell you so!

631
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:54,080
What will you get out of lying to me

632
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:55,485
that too in Bhojpuri?!

633
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:57,083
Ask whatever you want in Hindi

634
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,082
You wanted to find out where
Sheetal is right?

635
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,492
Don't play games with me.

636
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,422
You're not that evolved

637
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:14,104
Did she say anything?

638
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,638
..that she won't come back.

639
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,035
Thank God! At least
she left a message..

640
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,234
I waited for two years!

641
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:22,570
Did she tell you anything?

642
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,114
She had called..

643
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,712
She said she was very upset.

644
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,257
Feeling bad?

645
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,123
I'm feeling bad and I'm in pain.

646
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,400
Look Ranjeet I didn't let

647
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:59,147
..will you tell me?

648
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:00,281
Yes

649
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:18,029
I'm writing that I've
taken sedatives and I'm asleep.

650
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:20,560
Please do not disturb.

651
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:25,366
Please put this on the door
on your way out.

652
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:26,509
Yes

653
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:31,375
You will remain here all night?

654
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:50,065
Higher.. higher..

655
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:19,095
Hope Lord Ram makes it happen'

656
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:25,165
That my sleep comes to you'

657
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:28,031
I stay awake'

658
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,420
Libran?

659
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,211
I spoke to you over the phone'

660
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,282
I'd called you instead of
calling the doctor

661
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,488
I sang for you too.. Don't
you remember?

662
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,222
Your sorrows now are mine..

663
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:29,499
You didn't recognize me?

664
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:30,633
Okay no problem.

665
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,234
I know who you are.

666
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:34,233
He told me everything about you

667
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:38,569
Only for a few more days..

668
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,302
After that it's all clear for you

669
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,035
His wife just left him and went away

670
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,647
Okay

671
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,043
I'll talk to him myself.

672
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,797
Can I advise you on something?

673
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,799
Go ahead..

674
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:06,060
I think.. you should leave
him alone tonight.

675
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,064
You'll see him tomorrow

676
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:10,069
at you door step wagging his tail.

677
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,600
You have some importance too!

678
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,068
Let him realize that.

679
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,477
One more thing..

680
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,210
don't meet 3-4 times a week.

681
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:18,681
Just meet once a week.

682
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,084
So he told you he meets me..

683
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:25,414
three to four times a week?

684
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:26,681
Oh forget about what he said.

685
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,157
If you take my advise..

686
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:30,691
he'll meet you everyday with an
orange carnation..

687
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:32,295
and you'll say'

688
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:35,156
Don't hit me with these marigolds..

689
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,295
Were you supposed to go
for dinner tonight?

690
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:38,559
Yes I was supposed to go..

691
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:39,702
But how did you know that?

692
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,430
I didn't tell you about it.
I'm sure he told you himself.

693
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:43,773
What did he say?

694
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:02,392
You're not sleeping yet?

695
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,526
You're not gone yet?!

696
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,183
Forget the questions first
congratulate me.

697
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,052
Thank me.
- Why?

698
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,758
Mr. Thadani you're not
only lucky with money

699
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,595
you're lucky to have
a friend like me.

700
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:13,736
What did you do now?

701
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:15,293
She was here!
- Who?

702
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,330
That woman your wanton!

703
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:21,474
Bharat Bhushan drove her away!

704
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:22,735
You drove Suman Rao away?

705
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,074
Just cannot happen!

706
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,079
I swear on Tansen' God
won't make me lie

707
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,342
She won't pile on you.

708
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,647
By the way she's quite pretty.

709
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:32,288
But she sings very badly.

710
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:33,689
She's a singer too?

711
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,288
You copulate with all
your singers?

712
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:44,625
My father used to say

713
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:47,361
a man's real honour is
in his integrity..

714
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:49,604
in his power of control.

715
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,706
How much ever you try and
control your mind

716
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,110
your concentration gets that
much better.

717
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:56,839
You'll have success in work..

718
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:58,340
respect in society.

719
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,677
Gautam Buddha said that.

720
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,189
But it has been followed only by
my father and me.

721
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:10,058
Besides Indumati I never even
looked at another woman.

722
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,055
Oh Mind why don't you
hold on to your reins!

723
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,254
Saint Bharat Bhushan..

724
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:16,532
Good Night!

725
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,062
I'll get that.

726
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,428
I thought you were alone.
- This is..

727
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,257
He was alone but I didn't let
him feel that way.

728
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:54,097
I spoke to you over the phone'

729
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:56,765
when I called for the rights of
Jantar Mantar..

730
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,601
District Babua..Bhojpur city.. Toto!

731
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:03,442
You were about to leave Mr. Bhushan?

732
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,644
I have some bad news.

733
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,048
She called..
- Sheetal?

734
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:14,715
Yes Sheetal she came here and..

735
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,381
Here? She didn't come here!

736
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,727
She wasn't here? No

737
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:19,388
Anyway I don't know where she
went but right now..

738
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:20,530
she's on her way to
Keval Arora's house.

739
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,394
What's wrong with her?

740
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:28,069
He will take advantage of her

741
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:29,205
on the pretext of being her
emotional support.

742
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,807
And what did you do?

743
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:33,266
Anant I married her!

744
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:41,484
You're still here?

745
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:43,276
Well yes yes I..

746
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:44,420
What yes yes I?

747
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:45,755
Do whatever you want to do at home!

748
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:50,487
He's one big bastard that
Keval Arora!

749
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:52,091
May be that's why she's
going there..

750
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:53,296
to put you down.

751
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,560
Bhalla was a big fraud too!

752
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,767
Mr. Bhushan I'm sick of
listening to your nonsense.

753
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:00,095
Please get out!

754
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:04,640
Do you know where he lives?

755
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:06,509
Who Bhalla?

756
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:09,236
How will I know where he stays?

757
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:12,782
Nobody knows

758
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,718
Just give it.

759
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:18,219
Her phone is unreachable.

760
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,218
Keval Arora pirated DVD racket

761
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,357
His house was raided recently.

762
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:24,058
His file is right on top at the
Income Tax Office.

763
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:25,524
My friend is handling his case.

764
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,262
He knows Keval Arora

765
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,530
He claims to know RD Burman also!

766
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:39,809
his friend..

767
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,755
Look my name is..

768
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,082
I know..

769
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,291
You are not getting it..

770
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,360
I am not getting it?

771
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:01,497
First explain it to him!

772
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,026
Such deeds will never bear fruit!

773
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:06,031
When He strikes there is no sound!

774
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:08,504
Who?

775
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,107
Oh right!

776
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:12,708
Now please come..

777
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:14,036
Come..

778
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,442
Sometimes on this foot..

779
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,047
Sometimes on that foot..

780
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:22,040
Constantly chained..

781
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:23,643
Am I'

782
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:27,216
Like anklets'

783
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:30,526
You sing so well!

784
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:35,631
Can I show you something?

785
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,134
Yes yes show me..

786
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:10,700
Have a look

787
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,362
What is this?
- My story

788
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:17,705
Expressed in music and songs

789
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,276
Has Ranjeet seen this?

790
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,677
Yes

791
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,038
Yes but how would he know..

792
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,038
how it feels when
pieces of broken

793
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,182
glass pierce through the heart

794
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,123
Thank you friend

795
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,524
Lets go in?

796
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:45,127
The story of Mr.Bhushan
expressed in music and songs!

797
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,067
Do you know how many songs
are in there?

798
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:50,104
How many?
Three hundred?

799
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:51,262
Four hundred?
Five hundred?

800
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:53,536
One thousand seven hundred
and thirty three

801
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,340
Twenty-seven of which have not
been released as yet!

802
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,645
Haven't been released? Then
how did you get them?

803
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:01,307
I was a regular at Anand
Bakshi's house.

804
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:02,542
I was like a son to him.

805
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,487
You can say up to AR Rahman

806
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:11,216
What were you saying about
Keval Arora?

807
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:13,021
When was I saying anything?

808
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:14,220
He was talking I
was just listening!

809
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:15,364
Do you know him?

810
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:18,232
Who doesn't know him? The
world knows him.

811
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,295
Pirated DVD scam it
was in the papers.

812
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:23,034
But do you know him personally?

813
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:24,673
My friend knows him..

814
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:27,306
He is handling his case at the
income tax department

815
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:31,180
Now?

816
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:37,447
What do you know about
Raag Shivranjini?

817
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,286
O Basanti..

818
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,726
Pure and mad..

819
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:50,324
Don't go.. don't go..

820
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,462
Someone stop her'

821
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:55,734
No one knows'

822
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:59,072
Where did those days go'

823
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:03,544
In the shadow of your memory
I would say'

824
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:08,678
I'm ready to surrender my vision

825
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,351
Friend no longer is a friend..

826
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:18,694
Love no longer remained a love..

827
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:21,129
Raj Kapoor was very
fond of Shivranjini

828
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:23,566
Can we call Asif Khan?

829
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:27,630
But it's not possible today.
It's difficult.

830
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:29,438
Why?

831
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:30,573
India and Pakistan are
playing a match..

832
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:31,764
He wont budge from the TV

833
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,042
Why don't you just call
me Mr. Pollution?!

834
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:39,640
But first I have to check the score.

835
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:43,042
Only then I can call
him with an excuse..

836
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:44,709
..to talk about the match.

837
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,653
Where is the TV?
- Come with me

838
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,398
This TV is really big.

839
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:22,019
Six.. Almost..

840
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,155
Asif Merchant is going
to get it today!

841
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:35,703
This guy is too much!

842
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,037
You were going to..

843
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,175
I got stuck!

844
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:43,705
He was your dinner talent? Him?

845
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,504
You find this funny?

846
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,117
Sehwag hit a six!!

847
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,316
God makes a pair' One
blind one leper'

848
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:06,268
Only two balls to go..

849
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,066
One more ball..

850
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:25,211
Oh you are back!

851
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:27,082
Hello Mrs. Thadani.

852
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:28,223
Whom did you send away?

853
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:30,616
Whom did you send away?

854
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:42,497
She had light eyes short hair?

855
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,370
Oh so there's someone else too!?

856
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:47,576
You sent her away?

857
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:48,844
But you were the one who told me..

858
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:50,775
if the wanton comes not to
allow her inside.

859
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,574
What did you tell her?
- Whom?

860
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:54,239
My wife! That was Sheetal!

861
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:55,441
Nothing
- What is a wanton?

862
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:57,249
She came home and you
drove her away?

863
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:59,587
I didn't know she wasn't
the wanton and this one was!

864
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:01,256
What is a wanton?

865
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:08,256
Later later' why don't
you tell me clearly

866
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:09,398
that you don't want me anymore?

867
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:14,737
Because of you ..

868
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,394
I turned down Keval
Arora's music video

869
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:20,733
Because of you ..

870
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:23,140
I've left both my dogs in the
car without the AC

871
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:28,340
Suman please leave before this
rising water suffocates me

872
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:31,618
Water will rise over your head

873
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:33,085
and I hope you drown in it!

874
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:38,159
But before I leave tell
me one thing..

875
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:55,310
Had fun?

876
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:57,646
Are you happy now?

877
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,577
This what you wanted? Right?

878
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,376
Are you a translator or something?

879
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,049
Are you here to impart
your education to everyone?

880
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:07,714
To err is human

881
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,051
You're human? You're an idiot!

882
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,659
Aren't idiots humans
too Mr. Thadani?

883
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:16,063
He is trying to help us

884
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:19,066
Us? Help us?

885
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,395
Ok! He was trying to help you!

886
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,232
Please call Asif

887
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:32,278
Look my name is Bharat Bhushan.

888
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:34,216
For me you are no less than
Madan Mohan..

889
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:36,342
those songs that conviction!

890
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:40,221
I'm only doing this for you.
- Go ahead

891
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:41,481
First ask him to tell me.

892
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:46,628
Ranjeet tell him..

893
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:49,698
Please say something..

894
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,291
Think about Sheetal..

895
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:55,565
Think about Keval Arora..

896
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,375
waves of the sea..cool breeze..

897
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:10,210
The Jacuzzi with Keval
and Sheetal..

898
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:28,528
It is ringing.

899
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:29,767
Asif this is Bhushan

900
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:34,399
Bharat your Dhoni was washed
out by the Pakistanis..

901
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,803
I'm watching the match too there
are lots of overs left..

902
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:39,606
When they could not do anything
in 43 overs what can they do now?

903
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:40,908
Have you forgotten about the
Multan one day?

904
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,247
So badly were you uprooted
that you are still holding it in your hand.

905
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:43,680
Get lost!

906
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:45,413
You get lost!

907
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:48,948
Eats in this land
sings of that land!

908
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:50,759
What a character! I know!-

909
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:51,826
I've been tolerating
him all evening!

910
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:53,356
You hung up?

911
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:57,364
I'll call him again.

912
01:03:57,867 --> 01:03:59,892
Don't worry. We fight
all the time..

913
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:01,161
but we are best friends.

914
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,632
We can die for each other.

915
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:03,829
Put the speaker phone on please

916
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:06,905
Redial.

917
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,789
Asif listen to me carefully

918
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:23,582
There are just six over left.

919
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,588
What has your Bhajji uprooted?

920
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,553
Forget the match man. I had some
important work .

921
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:30,256
On one condition..

922
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,829
"Say Rahul Dravid down, down."

923
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:35,334
India bye bye

924
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:36,869
Have you lost your mind? Never!

925
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:37,863
In that case get lost

926
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,871
Please say it..

927
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,444
What happened? Caught in
a religious dilemma?

928
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:46,878
I'm only doing this for you
Ranjeet Thadani.

929
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:50,543
India hai hai Rahul Dravid bye bye

930
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:53,854
You actually said it!

931
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:55,751
Is everything okay?

932
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:57,221
Something very important..

933
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:58,883
You are handling Keval Arora's
case right?

934
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:00,158
Who? That music guy?

935
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:02,160
I need his address

936
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:05,164
I gave you Ravindra Jain's
address you got kicked out of there!

937
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:07,832
Ravindra Jain is blind. He
doesn't know what real talent is.

938
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:11,598
Blind? Even a deaf man would
throw you out after listening to you sing

939
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:16,238
Stop fooling around my friend's
wife is with Keval Arora!

940
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:18,345
Your friend's wife is with him?

941
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:20,510
She's not going to come back
as she was!

942
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:24,581
Why are you talking
nonsense? Just give me the address!

943
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:28,584
It's at the office.
I'll get it tomorrow.

944
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,290
I need it today. It's
very important.

945
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:32,825
Get it today please Asif!

946
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:34,292
I just got home!

947
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:35,461
The office is shut.

948
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:37,823
We'll record it

949
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:39,797
We'll record the match for you.

950
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,305
I haven't even eaten my dinner.

951
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:46,507
I thought after Pakistan wins
I'll eat in peace.

952
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:48,470
Come here! We'll order something
for you.

953
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:49,508
No no.. no..

954
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:53,905
You come here soon. Okay see you.

955
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:57,218
We won Mr. Thadani! We won!

956
01:05:58,054 --> 01:06:00,147
He's the most honest
tax inspector of my department.

957
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:02,647
For the first time he's taking a
bribe.. Only for me

958
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:03,623
He's my friend after all.

959
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,195
He can look at a person's
face and tell how much money he has!

960
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:10,789
You called a tax inspector home..

961
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:12,458
Congratulations!

962
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:58,803
Ashish Rajender.

963
01:06:58,981 --> 01:06:59,504
Majumdar.

964
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:01,213
Jogain Choudhary.

965
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:02,678
Manjith Bawa.

966
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:03,614
Manjith Bawa.

967
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:07,654
29 lacs only for this one!

968
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:09,480
Have you declared them?

969
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:12,657
You both are still here?

970
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,522
Don't you want to order food for Asif?

971
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:16,161
Yes we have to order food

972
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:17,830
He is your best friend right?

973
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,160
He is the best.

974
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:21,229
So he won't come here and
inspect the house right?

975
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:22,735
You are strange.

976
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:25,297
One day he ordered a raid
into his own house.

977
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:27,567
But when are we going
to order food?

978
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:28,874
Asif likes pizza?

979
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:29,834
A lot.

980
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:31,371
And you?

981
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:32,377
More than that.

982
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:42,785
Please order a vegetarian
one for me.

983
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:45,184
I don't eat non veg on Fridays

984
01:07:58,841 --> 01:07:59,933
Can you ask for extra cheese for me?

985
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:02,133
Its something else to
have extra cheese ..

986
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:03,369
..but these guys are not generous.

987
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,648
Can you ask for some extra
tissues. They don't give enough'

988
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:09,682
Once I had sent one of them back
to get the tissues

989
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,255
I had asked for extra cheese..

990
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,256
Tell him to write it down else
he'll forget it later.

991
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:23,264
These days they don't
give anything free! Cheats!

992
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,164
Ask them about the time offer
so that we can..

993
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:29,168
Claim for the free pizza.. Last month

994
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:53,720
Sheetal's left you and gone..

995
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:56,888
but I feel more sorry to see
you at his mercy.

996
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,467
You should get the Padmabhushan
for this!

997
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:03,465
My name is Bharat Bhushan! How
many times have I told you?!

998
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:04,697
You should remember by now.

999
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:06,636
Oh I couldn't find it..

1000
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:07,468
What?

1001
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:08,803
Black pepper?

1002
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:10,440
Oh there it is.

1003
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,137
Do you have brown bread at home?

1004
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,316
Asif is very diet conscious
these days.

1005
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:17,408
Move..

1006
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:20,482
It will be better if it's toasted.

1007
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:23,623
Some cheese also please

1008
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,251
Anything else?

1009
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:26,520
No nothing.

1010
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:29,529
I forgot the salt inside.

1011
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,192
Looks like he is not used to
doing household work!

1012
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:36,165
Beer?

1013
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:38,169
No sir. My father used to say
beer is the younger..

1014
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:41,605
.. sister of alcohol and every bad
deed begins with a baby step.

1015
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:43,411
If I have beer it will lead
me to a beer bar..

1016
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:44,738
From a beer bar to a dance bar..

1017
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:45,437
Asif drinks?

1018
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:47,649
No he doesn't drink
when he is on duty

1019
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:48,612
What duty does he have here?

1020
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:49,883
You don't get it.

1021
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,813
He considers my work
no less than a duty.

1022
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:56,583
Looks like Asif is here.
I'll get it I'll get it.

1023
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:00,452
Asif.

1024
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:07,934
Asif my brother!

1025
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:09,298
What brother?!

1026
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:11,537
You made me open the office at night ..

1027
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:13,441
..climb seven floors without a lift.

1028
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:15,835
I'll thank you sometime later
come in for now

1029
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:17,877
Come on in.

1030
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:21,445
Meet him this is Mr..

1031
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:23,944
First tell me what happened?

1032
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:26,787
What's there to happen? His wife
is not back yet that's why..

1033
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:27,615
Shoot the wife!

1034
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:29,516
What happened to the match?

1035
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:32,420
Match is over! India won!

1036
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:34,788
First meet him this
is Mr. Ranjeet Thadani

1037
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:41,698
And this is his very good friend
Mr. Anant Ghoshal

1038
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:46,874
This is your house?

1039
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:48,708
Yes.

1040
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:54,839
Why?

1041
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:56,884
India could not have won!

1042
01:10:57,486 --> 01:10:58,783
You missed the last over!

1043
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:00,819
Irfan hit 11 runs in 5 balls!

1044
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:04,752
You can watch the
highlights tomorrow

1045
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:06,652
Highlight.

1046
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:07,929
You didn't record the match?

1047
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:09,661
How would I know that after
Pakistan lost..

1048
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:10,560
you would still watch the match?

1049
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:12,792
You said you would record
it that's why I left the house

1050
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:16,337
Last time Pakistan lost you
cried for three days!

1051
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:18,939
You please come.
Please come.

1052
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:21,936
You are too much.
- Just one plate?

1053
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:23,335
Do you eat cheese?
Your omelet is coming

1054
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:24,274
Am I the only one eating?

1055
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:27,642
We have eaten we were
just waiting for you.

1056
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:28,783
Very nice'

1057
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:30,809
"Take this, have it. - Wonderful."

1058
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:32,946
Thadani.

1059
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:35,848
I'd audited one Anil Thadani.

1060
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:39,557
Do you know him?

1061
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:41,827
May be.

1062
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:42,820
Where does he live?

1063
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:43,487
In jail!

1064
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:52,536
His had a similar house in Juhu..

1065
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:54,832
..he used to play the stock
exchange game.

1066
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:57,869
What's your game?

1067
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:01,212
I told you earlier he
has a music company'

1068
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,920
There's a lot of money in this
music company game

1069
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:09,650
Will you give the address please?

1070
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:19,663
Too good! Who made it?

1071
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:23,200
Mr. Thadani made it but
the recipe is ours..

1072
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:26,903
..onion garlic and coriander
paste which he made fresh..

1073
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:29,435
with a little pepper
and a little honey.

1074
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:43,951
D 5

1075
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:47,323
Hold on..

1076
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:49,386
do you have the registry papers
of this house?

1077
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,831
This house has been made
on reclaimed land..

1078
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:55,762
do you have the power of attorney?

1079
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:58,930
I'd told you earlier he's the
best inspector of our department!

1080
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:01,474
He takes one look at the face
and knows how deep the pockets are!

1081
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:03,270
He's come here to help us
or to raid the house?

1082
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,407
Why do you doubt them? They
are good people!

1083
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:10,612
They even heard my story' in
music and songs

1084
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,445
Really Mr. Thadani?-Yes.

1085
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:17,317
Tell them..

1086
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:21,895
In that case I have to give
it only for you Bharat Bhushan!

1087
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:23,254
Write it'

1088
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:24,691
D 531.

1089
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,399
"Shanti Sadan, Juhu scheme."

1090
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:28,896
Thank you very much.

1091
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:32,203
Wait..

1092
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:36,636
Just wait! At least find out
if he's there at home or not.

1093
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:38,671
He'll kick you out!

1094
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:43,348
We got the address right? Get
these clowns out of here!

1095
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:44,713
At least call him up.

1096
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:50,586
Firstly I shall disconnect the
phone and throw it out of the house

1097
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,958
Let's call him first on someone
else's name

1098
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:00,162
He's on a flight to Canada tonight.

1099
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:04,472
We'll say we are calling from
Anil Grover's office..

1100
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,899
..and Ranjeet Thadani knows
his wife is with you.

1101
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:09,605
But he will recognize my voice..

1102
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:10,910
You..

1103
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:12,377
Mine too..

1104
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:13,670
He knows my voice too..

1105
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:16,611
Now don't tell me I have to call!

1106
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:18,682
Have we lost our minds that
we are going to ask you to call?!

1107
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:21,686
Yes you have lost it'

1108
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:23,414
So should I call?

1109
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:25,792
"Hey, I'll teach him."

1110
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:28,361
He can't learn a thing!

1111
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:30,228
If you don't like my style
you can say no.

1112
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,632
Say you're calling from
Anil Grover's office..

1113
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:34,334
Perfect.

1114
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:36,363
What perfect?
Did you understand?

1115
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:37,670
What is there to understand?

1116
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,806
Look Mr. Bhushan let's
do a small rehearsal.

1117
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:43,943
You are calling from Anil
Grover's office and he has left for Canada.

1118
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,645
I'm speaking from Anil
Grover's office and he has left for Canada.

1119
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,442
And Ranjeet Thadani knows that
his wife is with you..

1120
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:52,420
And if you do not send her
back then there might be blood shed!

1121
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:56,222
Wow! Bhushan! No one at
the office knows about your talents.

1122
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:00,351
How was it Mr. Thadani?-

1123
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:02,821
Should I change my voice and say..
if you don't send her back..

1124
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:04,764
Do as you are told!

1125
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:09,533
Asif can we have the number?

1126
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,366
If I can get something to drink
after the omelet..

1127
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:22,511
26057 482

1128
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:32,252
Now it's time for fun!

1129
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:35,554
Why is he not answering?

1130
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:36,923
He must be busy!

1131
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,228
"Hello, hello."

1132
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:43,529
I am speaking from Anil
Grover's office.

1133
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:47,931
Before he left for Canada he
asked me to tell you something..

1134
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:49,441
Poor guy sounds exhausted!

1135
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:51,776
Ranjeet Thadani knows..

1136
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:53,209
that his wife is with you.

1137
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:58,518
Grover knows I am with Sabina
Merchant the tax inspector's wife!

1138
01:15:58,987 --> 01:15:59,476
Who are you?

1139
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:24,810
Asif my brother!

1140
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,908
Bhushan' your sister-in-law?

1141
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:39,658
Redial.

1142
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:47,196
This is Asif Merchant speaking.

1143
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:50,333
Listen to me carefully.

1144
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:53,207
Tomorrow I am coming
to your house ..

1145
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,433
..with three officers
for a final audit.

1146
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:55,941
Be ready..

1147
01:16:59,314 --> 01:16:59,905
Give the phone to Sabina'

1148
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:02,773
Make her speak to me

1149
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:05,546
I know she is there give it to her.

1150
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:10,148
Sabina.

1151
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:16,158
If your friend's kid's
birthday party is over come home.

1152
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:18,732
I'm going to sleep in the kids room.

1153
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:22,232
Malti has kept food on the table..

1154
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:23,632
..if you don't want to eat
it keep it in the fridge.

1155
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:45,220
There's no need to be sorry.

1156
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:48,659
Anil Thadani is your relative..

1157
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:51,232
You don't know that but I do.

1158
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:55,826
Next week there will
be a tax audit..

1159
01:17:57,639 --> 01:17:58,367
Be ready!

1160
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:00,508
Good night.

1161
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,276
Asif I'll drop you outside.

1162
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:18,711
Don't worry I won't answer it'

1163
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:21,414
I've cleared the table I'm
leaving now.

1164
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:40,897
Hospital.. Is everything alright?

1165
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:48,480
Should I come with you?

1166
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:52,776
For your information I
used to drive the ..

1167
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:53,511
..jeep in my colony since I was'

1168
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:54,313
Do you have a license?

1169
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:54,784
Yes

1170
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:58,623
Wait for two minutes' I'm coming

1171
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:16,438
If you don't answer I will..

1172
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:19,278
Ms. Suman Rao are you okay?

1173
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:22,278
I was just making some milkshake.

1174
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:23,407
Okay.

1175
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:26,251
Look his wife met
with an accident..

1176
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:27,513
..he's gone to the hospital.

1177
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:28,212
Accident?

1178
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:29,222
Yes.

1179
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:30,482
Serious?

1180
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:32,550
Well if it's an accident it
has to be serious.

1181
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:33,659
Keep the phone down Mr.Bhushan?

1182
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:36,354
Don't talk like that'

1183
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:37,225
Why not?

1184
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:41,229
Lying runs in his blood.

1185
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:44,271
Why me he will not be happy
with any other girl.

1186
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:45,838
Ms. Suman Rao have
faith in yourself

1187
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:47,397
And can I say something?

1188
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:50,276
Mr. Thadani might never
be able to tell you..

1189
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:52,242
..but he loves his wife a lot.

1190
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:57,443
She's going to commit suicide.

1191
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:59,246
She's blackmailing you you donkey!

1192
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:10,724
He only sees his advantage..

1193
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:13,425
and for his happiness he
can hurt anyone..

1194
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:15,536
he will play with anyone's emotions.

1195
01:21:16,304 --> 01:21:18,204
Don't you know?
Talent party?

1196
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:21,706
Every Friday he calls one
person home to poke fun at him.

1197
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:24,812
That poor guy doesn't even
know he's being made fun of.

1198
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:26,405
You and Suman are becoming
good friends?

1199
01:21:27,315 --> 01:21:28,612
Come' on we are getting late.

1200
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:29,807
We'll talk in the car. Let's go.

1201
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:32,714
Why me?

1202
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:40,427
You chose me for this dinner
because I'm emotional?

1203
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:42,291
I'm sensitive?

1204
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:44,960
Because I have a desire to
do something?

1205
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:47,696
Because I'm a fool?

1206
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:55,798
My father used to tell me..

1207
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:57,940
No..

1208
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:00,241
From now I won't
tell you anything

1209
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:05,617
You are being sentimental
for no reason.

1210
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:13,794
You are still lying to me.

1211
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:15,657
Suman was right..

1212
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:17,789
You are not a good man..

1213
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:18,591
I'm not a good man!

1214
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:29,436
Mr Thadani number one bastard!

1215
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:38,315
There's no need to come.
That's why I called.

1216
01:22:43,558 --> 01:22:44,547
I know everything

1217
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:47,220
About that Suman.

1218
01:23:14,756 --> 01:23:16,656
Why are you
drinking so much?

1219
01:23:17,759 --> 01:23:18,191
Why not?

1220
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:20,853
The story is over!

1221
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:24,221
Ranjeet Thadani's pride has
been broken..

1222
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:25,755
Everyone has left him and gone..

1223
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:27,359
and now Bharat Bhushan
is leaving him too.

1224
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:31,334
All night he will be lying
drunk on the floor.

1225
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:33,433
He got what he deserves.

1226
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:43,277
I am going to call
Lilavati Hospital right now.

1227
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:50,622
I shall get you the last chance.

1228
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:03,835
There's one Mrs. Sheetal
Thadani who has had an accident.

1229
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:05,330
Can I speak to her?

1230
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:08,240
To talk to a patient you have
to call before six

1231
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:11,177
But it's still not six yet.

1232
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:14,338
It is very important..

1233
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:18,212
Dr. Shepard she is not
letting me speak.

1234
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:18,681
What?

1235
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:19,182
One minute madam..

1236
01:24:20,955 --> 01:24:23,253
Hello this is Dr. Shephard.

1237
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:26,192
Can I speak to Sheetal Thadani?

1238
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:31,460
In matters of life and death..

1239
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:34,193
sorry' and please' will not work.

1240
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:45,206
I'm Bharat Bhushan.

1241
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:48,676
Your husband's dinner game idiot.

1242
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:50,211
I met you at your door.

1243
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:55,550
All this has happened
because of me.

1244
01:24:56,324 --> 01:24:58,519
Mr. Thadani is to blame too..

1245
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:00,752
But I'm a partner in this crime too

1246
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:02,825
Now look..

1247
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:04,161
Look Mrs. Sheetal..

1248
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:07,498
Mr. Thadani is ashamed
of what he did.

1249
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:09,429
Whatever you may call him..

1250
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:10,766
good or bad..

1251
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:12,563
He's selfish he's mean..

1252
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:13,773
that he is..

1253
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:16,669
But right now he's very sad.

1254
01:25:17,645 --> 01:25:20,170
That is only because you
are not with him.

1255
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:23,612
My father used to say that..

1256
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,183
if you want to go away you must..

1257
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:28,720
go away from sin not
from the sinner.

1258
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:32,185
My wife left me two years ago.

1259
01:25:33,294 --> 01:25:34,522
I am still waiting for
her to come back.

1260
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:36,623
I'm heart broken..

1261
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:38,525
but I cannot forget her.

1262
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,763
I know he is sitting next to you..

1263
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:42,394
and he's asking you to say all this.

1264
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:44,266
No..

1265
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:46,199
Mrs. Sheetal I..

1266
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:48,366
I am calling from a public booth

1267
01:25:49,377 --> 01:25:50,844
Mr. Bhushan you don't know Ranjeet

1268
01:25:51,446 --> 01:25:52,743
He only thinks about himself.

1269
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:55,908
I have been with him since the
past two hours.

1270
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:58,485
He is suffering in your thoughts..

1271
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,143
..and is desperate to meet you.

1272
01:26:00,855 --> 01:26:04,757
And he got so anxious that he
called Keval Arora..

1273
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:05,887
What?

1274
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:09,622
He called Keval Arora?

1275
01:26:09,797 --> 01:26:13,563
You have no idea what he has gone
through to get to you.

1276
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:15,859
He threw Suman Rao
out of the house..

1277
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:18,504
He made up with Anant Ghoshal..

1278
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:22,170
and he also called a
tax inspector home..

1279
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:24,834
just to know where you are.

1280
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:28,178
And now he is depressed

1281
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:29,316
he's alone..

1282
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:32,886
and in sometime he is
going to be drunk..

1283
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:34,815
..and will pass out on the floor.

1284
01:26:36,558 --> 01:26:37,388
Mrs. Sheetal.

1285
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:41,358
I have only heard of people
dying in love

1286
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:45,355
but I think I am going to see
it for the first time.

1287
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:00,472
She will definitely call back!

1288
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,512
Mr. Bhushan if you want..

1289
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,152
you can take me out for
a dinner anytime.

1290
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:08,515
I'll surely come along
as your idiot.

1291
01:27:14,028 --> 01:27:15,552
But I want you to promise
me something..

1292
01:27:17,565 --> 01:27:18,156
Henceforth..

1293
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:20,561
never call anybody an idiot!

1294
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:41,455
This is Bharat Bhushan

1295
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:42,749
Weren't you at a PCO just now?

1296
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:45,326
No.. no..
