1
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:27,511
How was my massage?

2
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:31,412
Spare me five minutes daily.
I will strengthen your body.

3
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,183
How long will you take?

4
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:35,741
What is the position of strike?

5
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:37,193
I have informed 200 people.

6
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:39,797
Call Jhumki.

7
00:01:39,877 --> 00:01:43,275
Jhumki has stopped
coming to our gathering.

8
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:47,583
Hello! Tell me.

9
00:01:47,663 --> 00:01:52,471
People should be ready in
the airport at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow.

10
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:55,408
Each person will be given
2000 and a Non-Veg biryani packet.

11
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:58,673
It is auspicious month.
Should not eat non-veg.

12
00:01:58,753 --> 00:02:00,083
Don't you want to earn some bucks?

13
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:04,485
Never mind.
Pay 2500 each including biryani.

14
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:05,764
How many people will you get?

15
00:02:05,844 --> 00:02:07,425
How many do you want?

16
00:02:08,534 --> 00:02:10,720
We want Justice!

17
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,901
We want Justice!

18
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:14,982
We want Justice!

19
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:16,969
Down with the Government!
- Down! Down!

20
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:18,728
Down with the Government!
- Down! Down!

21
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:20,522
Down with the Government!
- Down! Down!

22
00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:22,633
Down with the Government!
- Down! Down!

23
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,003
Viewers! You can see
how the people are protesting.

24
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,006
Come on. Fast.

25
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,949
Minister! Down! Down!

26
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:38,965
Minister! Down! Down!

27
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:42,048
Minister! Down! Down!

28
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:45,113
Minister! Down! Down!

29
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:48,004
Will pour kerosene
and commit suicide!

30
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:54,015
Down with Ghanashyam Yadav!

31
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:01,701
Sir.

32
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:08,125
Down with Ghanashyam Yadav!

33
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:11,398
Take out.

34
00:03:11,478 --> 00:03:13,280
Phone? Gun? Or Pen?

35
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,707
Down with Ghanashyam Yadav!

36
00:03:24,517 --> 00:03:28,135
Sir! Will wear Yellow sapphire
golden ring on my index finger!

37
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,498
Good. Yellow sapphire is auspicious.

38
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:36,565
You will be protected by
God in any adverse circumstances.

39
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:46,095
[Sanskrit chant]

40
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:48,136
O God! Bless only me.

41
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:50,948
People are revolting.
We are unable to control them.

42
00:03:51,028 --> 00:03:52,380
What is the order?

43
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:57,113
They will shout like this
till their breakfast is digested.

44
00:03:57,193 --> 00:04:01,321
They will go back in the
evening when they want to drink.

45
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:03,957
Sir...
- Do not be tensed. Get the car.

46
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,397
Sir...

47
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:08,269
One person is threatening to
commit suicide by pouring kerosene.

48
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:13,244
He is a good actor! Just
poured kerosene. Not lighted it.

49
00:04:13,324 --> 00:04:15,189
Don't worry. Get the car.

50
00:04:22,253 --> 00:04:24,074
Hello! Minister's car has started.

51
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:56,747
Who are they?

52
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,505
Sir, who has attack?

53
00:07:42,585 --> 00:07:45,615
Can you please let us know
who attack the minister?

54
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:48,609
Please. I can't tell you
anything right now.

55
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:50,088
I am sorry. Please.
- Sir please let us know.

56
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:53,176
Come on let's move. Hurry up.
- Sir please. Wait. Sir...

57
00:08:17,804 --> 00:08:19,555
Your call is unreachable...

58
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:21,410
You are unable to give
security to even the Minister.

59
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,048
He is being attacked.

60
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,850
How will you give
security to common people?

61
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,914
We are also worried
about this incident.

62
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:28,482
It is a shame if the news about

63
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:30,234
Minister's attack is published
in the front page.

64
00:08:30,314 --> 00:08:31,364
Yes Sir.

65
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,713
Print about the person
who attacked in the 6th page.

66
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:37,099
Okay Sir.
- Maintain reader's curiosity.

67
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,640
Let the font size be big.

68
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,203
Let it be in red letters
in white background.

69
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:43,101
Okay Sir.
- Okay? You got it?

70
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:45,061
But Sir!
That is not the original news.

71
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:48,994
Who are you?
- Gagan Dikshit.

72
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:51,098
From Kolkata?
- Yes.

73
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,993
I saved the Minister
when he was attacked.

74
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,756
But I realized later
that the matter is different.

75
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:57,926
What is it?

76
00:08:58,006 --> 00:09:00,313
SD card was connected to it.

77
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,470
Amount is less.

78
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,219
Or else I will inform that
this is Minister's handiwork.

79
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:05,433
Wait. I will give.

80
00:09:05,513 --> 00:09:08,149
I told you to stage the act.
But you are acting smart.

81
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:10,257
I agreed because he told me.

82
00:09:10,337 --> 00:09:12,124
Minister staged this drama.

83
00:09:12,204 --> 00:09:13,557
Why should we do?

84
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:16,131
Don't you know it was a staged act?

85
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:19,588
O God! Did the Minister
pay money and staged this act?

86
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:21,217
But why?

87
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:24,925
What else? It is Political
gimmick for sympathy votes.

88
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:27,278
I got doubt when he was attacked.

89
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,990
There was a lot of firing.
But nobody was hurt.

90
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,342
Checked and found
it to be a fake bullet.

91
00:09:39,876 --> 00:09:40,972
Mind blowing!

92
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,792
Other newspapers will
publish wrong news tomorrow.

93
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,135
But we will publish
original news with proof.

94
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:51,237
Great! Welcome to Bengaluru.

95
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:53,145
Why welcome me to my own place?

96
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:55,464
I need half a day leave. That's all.

97
00:09:55,603 --> 00:09:56,657
Thank you, Sir.

98
00:09:57,776 --> 00:09:58,814
One more thing.

99
00:09:58,894 --> 00:10:01,250
Do not mention my
name in tomorrow's news.

100
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:03,720
They will find out.

101
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:15,305
He has been admonished in paper.

102
00:10:15,385 --> 00:10:17,257
Sir will be angry.

103
00:10:17,337 --> 00:10:18,990
Do not feel bad if he scolds.

104
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,679
Do not be tensed.

105
00:10:25,976 --> 00:10:27,754
'Who is he?'

106
00:10:32,377 --> 00:10:34,059
'Who are you?'

107
00:10:34,262 --> 00:10:35,633
'It is me.'

108
00:10:35,713 --> 00:10:36,819
'Who is that person?'

109
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:43,113
It is 12o clock. Ring?

110
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:47,710
Someone is condemning me.
Are you talking about ring?

111
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,821
Shut up!

112
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:55,091
My left eye was
fluttering since morning!

113
00:10:55,342 --> 00:10:58,637
It is my bad time.

114
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:01,292
Raped in public!

115
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:02,944
Raped in public!

116
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:06,152
No one knows about my plan.

117
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:10,191
But who is he? How did he find out?

118
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,449
Who is he?

119
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:14,550
Who is he?

120
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:16,271
Who is he?

121
00:15:26,765 --> 00:15:32,179
Viewers! We are now in the location
where 6 films are being shot.

122
00:15:32,646 --> 00:15:37,806
We have not seen such a director

123
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:40,986
in the history of Cinema.

124
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,122
Where is the car?
Ours has broken down.

125
00:15:43,202 --> 00:15:47,481
So many people!
So many actors! So many technicians!

126
00:15:47,561 --> 00:15:50,975
A wonderful shooting
is taking place.

127
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:53,726
Who is the person behind this?

128
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:56,001
Who has dared to do this?

129
00:15:56,081 --> 00:16:00,170
Come and see the Director
who is shooting these 6 cinemas.

130
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:07,357
Cut it! Beauty!

131
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,973
Break!

132
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,450
I end up with giving
break to others!

133
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,525
Hi! One minute.

134
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:20,333
Come on! Ask.

135
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:23,122
How do you manage to
direct 6 cinemas at a time?

136
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:24,414
Don't you get confused?

137
00:16:24,494 --> 00:16:25,668
Don't you have problem

138
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:27,955
in shooting different scenes
for different cinemas?

139
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:29,806
That is not my problem.

140
00:16:29,886 --> 00:16:31,207
It is the problem of the viewers.

141
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:33,303
You know! By doing this, all
6 movies will turn out to be hits.

142
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:34,393
How?

143
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:37,228
The scene left out in one
movie will be in the next one.

144
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:40,549
And the scene left out
there will be in the next one.

145
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:43,257
If people go and
watch the last movie?!

146
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:44,484
Not possible.

147
00:16:44,564 --> 00:16:47,286
Because I would have left something
there and mixed everything.

148
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:49,231
The left out scenes
will be in the 6 cinemas

149
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:51,919
which I will be directing
together next year.

150
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:54,002
Come and watch the cinema next year,
if you have doubt.

151
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:55,524
Juice!

152
00:16:55,871 --> 00:16:58,993
Asked for juice.
But looks like paper piece!

153
00:16:59,073 --> 00:17:01,002
That is bill for 10 days shooting.

154
00:17:01,082 --> 00:17:02,452
I have still not got the money.

155
00:17:02,532 --> 00:17:03,773
You will get it. Wait.

156
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:05,162
Do you think I am
an ordinary director?

157
00:17:05,242 --> 00:17:08,118
Have you seen anyone
directing 6 films together?

158
00:17:08,198 --> 00:17:12,289
Different scenes are being shot.

159
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:14,524
They have never got mingled.

160
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:17,692
I say that it will not proceed.
- Why?

161
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:20,480
The Producer lost one of
his kidneys when the movie started.

162
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,488
He lost another kidney
once the shooting

163
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:27,468
started and now he is dead.

164
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:30,806
So many things happened by the time

165
00:17:30,886 --> 00:17:32,553
and I went and came
out of the caravan!

166
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,503
How to handle this person?

167
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:36,690
What to do now, Sir?

168
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,542
Give it. Till you get
a Producer to pay money...

169
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,939
He has stripped me!

170
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:50,458
If I had known,
I would have worked out yesterday!

171
00:17:50,623 --> 00:17:55,008
Viewers! See! The Director
who was directing 6 movies

172
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:57,729
together is now standing
with under pants.

173
00:17:58,553 --> 00:18:00,165
What is this?!

174
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:03,216
You will get good TRP.
Shall I remove the underpants also?

175
00:18:03,296 --> 00:18:04,593
Got scared.

176
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:10,301
Hello!
- Where are you?

177
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,121
You! In Bangalore?

178
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:14,514
I will stop all shootings
and come there immediately.

179
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,832
Pack up!

180
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:19,308
He cut the line.

181
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,085
Hey! Eating a lot!

182
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:28,557
It is complimentary.

183
00:18:28,637 --> 00:18:32,096
Why didn't you inform about your
arrival and are staying in a hotel?

184
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:33,444
Couldn't you call me?

185
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:36,050
Where do you keep your phone?
Always 'Not reachable'.

186
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,135
Is it?
- Yes.

187
00:18:37,215 --> 00:18:40,115
I always keep it in my underwear
packet so that I will get network.

188
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:42,457
You will get network
if the tower is good.

189
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:44,649
What?!
- Eat fast and come.

190
00:18:47,236 --> 00:18:50,236
'I will complain today in Customer
care that the tower is not good.'

191
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:58,032
'Sorry. The mobile you called
is not reachable at the moment.'

192
00:18:58,474 --> 00:19:01,477
'Please hold on for some time.'

193
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,165
My phone is not ringing.
Who is he calling?

194
00:19:08,895 --> 00:19:11,303
'The mobile you called...'
- Not getting.

195
00:19:11,587 --> 00:19:13,981
I have kept my mobile
in my shirt packet.

196
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:15,074
Any network problem?

197
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,620
You are here. Why should I call you?

198
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,817
Correct.

199
00:19:18,897 --> 00:19:22,103
One important person. His phone
is not reachable since 2 months.

200
00:19:22,183 --> 00:19:24,905
I have come to Bangalore to see him.

201
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:27,697
Many things which I should
know from him are pending.

202
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:29,515
Who is that?
- I will tell.

203
00:19:29,595 --> 00:19:32,891
Get your bike.
I have found a house for rent.

204
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,185
Let us go there.

205
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:36,690
Feel elated to hear
you speak in Kannada.

206
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,148
You were in Kolkata all these years.

207
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:40,550
Still you speak good Kannada. How?

208
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,986
Why Kolkata?

209
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:46,037
Even if I go to Kailash,
I will speak to God in Kannada.

210
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,117
Got a good dialogue for my picture.
- Okay.

211
00:19:49,197 --> 00:19:50,425
Come.
- Okay.

212
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:53,199
From now I will
also speak in Kannada.

213
00:19:58,382 --> 00:20:00,825
'Your destination has arrived.'
- Stop. We have reached the place.

214
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:02,485
Can see 'To let' board.

215
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,481
Are you coming here for rent?
- Yes. Why?

216
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:14,448
I do not come to this road
even to sell tomatoes after 6 p.m.

217
00:20:14,528 --> 00:20:17,968
Are you coming as
tenant to this house?!

218
00:20:18,699 --> 00:20:21,162
Someone committed
suicide in this house.

219
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:22,956
This is a haunted house.

220
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:24,605
A ghost house!

221
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,453
Who is that?

222
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:31,577
Who is the person who said
there is a ghost in my house?

223
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:33,404
I will test him.

224
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:36,953
Oh! I am caught.

225
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:38,067
Get lost.

226
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:44,036
Are you condemning my house
because you could not do business?

227
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:47,581
I will curse you if you stay here.
- Vegetables are getting spoiled!

228
00:20:47,661 --> 00:20:49,282
Leave my cart.
- Go away.

229
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:52,128
Go to burning ground.

230
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,252
Look here. A symbol!

231
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:55,385
Look here! A conch!

232
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:58,203
I perform all religious
rituals daily.

233
00:20:58,283 --> 00:21:01,562
Is it possible for devils
come to my house at night?

234
00:21:01,642 --> 00:21:04,566
No, Sir.
They will be scared of you.

235
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:08,025
You are right.

236
00:21:08,105 --> 00:21:10,084
I do not know whether
you praised or condemned me.

237
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:12,348
But I feel better.

238
00:21:12,497 --> 00:21:14,164
Come and see the house.
- No Sir.

239
00:21:14,244 --> 00:21:16,530
I came here because I saw
the house in website and liked it.

240
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,865
Let us come to the point.
- Please...

241
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:22,097
What is the rent?
- What is your budget?

242
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:25,435
We both are bachelors. 5000-6000?

243
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:27,638
Give that amount.
- Please do not go to his house.

244
00:21:27,718 --> 00:21:29,564
It is haunted.

245
00:21:29,644 --> 00:21:31,302
He is telling there is ghost here.

246
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:33,853
No chance of getting a house
in this area for that amount.

247
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:35,299
This man is going
to spoil our sleep!

248
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:36,716
Please keep quiet.

249
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:40,155
Advance?
- I don't need advance.

250
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:41,984
I told you there
is ghost in this house.

251
00:21:42,064 --> 00:21:43,077
That is the reason
he doesn't need advance.

252
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:44,715
I will not stay in this house.
- What is this?!

253
00:21:44,795 --> 00:21:47,093
Can the devil be more
ferocious than him? Keep quiet.

254
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,788
What did you say?
- Nothing.

255
00:21:48,868 --> 00:21:50,816
I like the house. Keep this advance.

256
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:52,437
We will go upstairs.

257
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:54,225
Thank you, sir
- Okay. See the house once.

258
00:21:54,305 --> 00:21:56,514
Let us look for another house.
No need to stay here.

259
00:21:56,594 --> 00:21:58,232
Ghost!

260
00:21:58,506 --> 00:22:00,268
Hello! You wretched lady!

261
00:22:00,348 --> 00:22:03,576
You went to your mother's
house saying there is ghost here.

262
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,387
Now I have a tenant.

263
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:07,010
Come back soon.

264
00:22:08,556 --> 00:22:09,863
No need for this.

265
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:37,341
Where is the main switch?

266
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:40,903
Main switch.

267
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:48,772
What a wonderful painting!

268
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:53,421
Bells! Watch! All antique pieces.

269
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:55,400
But no aunt here!

270
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,446
We need not bring even a spoon.

271
00:22:58,526 --> 00:23:02,292
The owner is giving
this beautifully furnished

272
00:23:02,372 --> 00:23:04,497
house for just Rupees 6000.

273
00:23:04,577 --> 00:23:06,214
There is definitely
some problem here.

274
00:23:06,294 --> 00:23:08,804
Is there a ghost here as
told by the vegetable vendor?

275
00:23:08,884 --> 00:23:10,890
Possible.
- Yes. Possible.

276
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,845
Do not speak like a stupid person.

277
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:15,612
There is God and Devil
in each and every person.

278
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:17,174
Let us consider your case.

279
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:20,462
You looked upon your Producer
as God when your movie started.

280
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:21,557
Correct?
- Yes.

281
00:23:21,637 --> 00:23:24,336
When the same movie was stalled, the
Producer looked like devil to you.

282
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:26,257
We are humans.

283
00:23:26,385 --> 00:23:28,280
We believe in God according
to the situation we are in.

284
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,642
Even if there is ghost here,
it will not harm me.

285
00:23:32,749 --> 00:23:35,112
Why? Does the ghost know
that you are 'Power star'?

286
00:23:35,192 --> 00:23:40,103
No. My father performed Puja
according to the planetary position

287
00:23:41,214 --> 00:23:44,147
in the solar system and
tied this sacred thread to me

288
00:23:44,227 --> 00:23:45,261
in spite of my objection.

289
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,896
Is it? What is the
power of this thread?

290
00:23:50,202 --> 00:23:56,706
[Sanskrit Chant]

291
00:23:58,466 --> 00:24:00,644
Take. Tie this to
your son's right hand.

292
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:07,680
You do not believe
in our scriptures.

293
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,585
If you want to respect your father,
tie this.

294
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:14,202
Because you are a Journalist.

295
00:24:14,282 --> 00:24:17,078
You roam everywhere
for investigation.

296
00:24:17,237 --> 00:24:20,279
I am tying this sacred
thread to ward off the evil eye.

297
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:24,933
Your planetary position
is not favorable now.

298
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:26,149
Show your hand.

299
00:24:26,229 --> 00:24:28,424
I have no faith in this.

300
00:24:28,504 --> 00:24:30,293
Will you be at peace if I wear it?

301
00:24:30,424 --> 00:24:31,913
Yes.
- Tie it then.

302
00:24:32,644 --> 00:24:36,237
You act like an atheist.
You should obey your father's words.

303
00:24:39,403 --> 00:24:41,407
Is this the story?
- Yes.

304
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:44,207
You need not fear for devil.

305
00:24:44,287 --> 00:24:46,311
Don't you fear for God?
- I do not fear.

306
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:48,696
I have a sort of faith.
- What is it?

307
00:24:49,145 --> 00:24:52,754
God came out of the Pillar
when I called him in my childhood.

308
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:53,927
Now I am grown up.

309
00:24:54,007 --> 00:24:56,512
If I call now,
won't the Gods turn up?

310
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:03,496
It is true. If you call, not just
Gods, all your fans here will come.

311
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,348
It was a dream. Lie down.

312
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,468
Dream?

313
00:26:15,483 --> 00:26:16,850
But I pissed.

314
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,032
That is also a dream. Lie down.

315
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:23,770
Since we told the truth that
the attack on Minister was a fake

316
00:26:23,914 --> 00:26:26,100
he has cut all
advertisements to the paper.

317
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,644
This is super news!

318
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:29,443
This will be headlines tomorrow.

319
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:31,529
You don't understand.

320
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:34,081
How can we run a big
Newspaper company without ads?

321
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:35,547
Let us be practical.

322
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:39,436
I will fix an appointment to write a
positive article about the Minister.

323
00:26:39,595 --> 00:26:41,069
You should take his interview.

324
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:43,033
We know that person is a loafer.

325
00:26:43,113 --> 00:26:44,327
How can we write
good things about him?

326
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:47,117
We are helpless. Please...

327
00:26:47,384 --> 00:26:48,459
You should do it.

328
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,626
I realized now that
Pen is mightier than sword.

329
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,827
If Politicians become
owners of the Pen Company

330
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:56,501
so pen has to be sharper.

331
00:26:58,565 --> 00:27:01,947
Seeing all this,
I feel like resigning this job.

332
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:05,655
Do not be emotional.
We are living in 2019.

333
00:27:05,821 --> 00:27:07,321
We should live
according to the time.

334
00:27:07,703 --> 00:27:11,134
If you resign, it will have
its impact on many employees.

335
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:12,977
Everyone's livelihood
is in your hands.

336
00:27:13,603 --> 00:27:15,895
Do not be sentimental.

337
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,274
I have more of family audience.

338
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:20,827
I will write.
I will write for your sake.

339
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:22,199
Will write tomorrow. Okay?

340
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,590
Okay.
- Tomorrow.

341
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,707
Do not forget.
It is confirmed for tomorrow.

342
00:27:30,771 --> 00:27:32,064
Hello Sir!
- Hi!

343
00:27:32,144 --> 00:27:34,696
My friend's number is
not reachable since 2 months.

344
00:27:34,776 --> 00:27:36,281
I will give the number.
Can you give his address?

345
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:40,208
You say he is your close friend.
Don't you know the address?

346
00:27:40,288 --> 00:27:42,643
I am sorry.
We cannot divulge address.

347
00:27:42,723 --> 00:27:45,390
Why are you speaking
to this assistant?

348
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,445
Call the Manager.

349
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:01,294
Madam!
- Yes.

350
00:28:01,374 --> 00:28:03,839
He wants details of
one of our subscribers.

351
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,147
Yes.
- Sorry sir.

352
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:07,927
Unless it is Government purpose,
we cannot disclose address.

353
00:28:08,007 --> 00:28:09,336
Madam! I am a Journalist.

354
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:12,016
Journalist! Then no chance.

355
00:28:13,835 --> 00:28:16,133
Just be quiet. See how I manage.

356
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:24,809
Look under. Something is there.

357
00:28:34,235 --> 00:28:35,835
500! Bribe?
- Sort of.

358
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:38,271
You bloody! What do you think of me?

359
00:28:38,351 --> 00:28:40,392
You idiot! What do you think of me?

360
00:28:40,472 --> 00:28:43,305
I will lose my job if I give
address to persons like you.

361
00:28:44,728 --> 00:28:45,874
'Bless you.'

362
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,615
Look! Bell is ringing.
Agrees to my words.

363
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:52,933
Why are you talking nonsense?
Just say that you will not give.

364
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,320
But I have a doubt.
- What?

365
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,284
You said about bell ringing...

366
00:28:56,364 --> 00:28:58,811
I can understand you are very

367
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:00,541
devotional like Mirabai.
- Why bother?

368
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:04,153
You give something to God
when you wish for something.

369
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,102
What do you call that?

370
00:29:06,182 --> 00:29:07,275
It is bribe. Right?

371
00:29:07,355 --> 00:29:08,999
Their individual work
is important to each person.

372
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,385
This is the rule.

373
00:29:10,575 --> 00:29:11,899
It will be helpful to
us if you give the address.

374
00:29:11,979 --> 00:29:13,453
That is why we asked.

375
00:29:14,136 --> 00:29:15,199
Come.

376
00:29:15,938 --> 00:29:17,598
Keep it!

377
00:29:19,427 --> 00:29:21,300
He is right. Isn't it Madam?

378
00:29:21,836 --> 00:29:24,329
I remember now.

379
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:27,508
I had prayed to God that

380
00:29:27,588 --> 00:29:29,673
I will donate Rupees 108
if I get promotion.

381
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,333
First I should do it.
You carry on. Right?

382
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:41,554
'The mobile you are calling
is unreachable at the moment'.

383
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:46,367
'The mobile you are calling
is unreachable at the moment'.

384
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:52,699
She scolded me as
if she is very honest.

385
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:54,299
People do many things for money.

386
00:29:54,379 --> 00:29:55,937
But she refused to give address.

387
00:29:56,101 --> 00:29:58,744
She did not scold you
because you gave money.

388
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:00,697
For giving less money.
- Oh!

389
00:30:00,816 --> 00:30:03,163
Do not mix the brand.

390
00:30:03,596 --> 00:30:06,448
Everything in this
world is a mixture.

391
00:30:06,528 --> 00:30:08,380
Our food is mixed...
Air is a mixture.

392
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,568
Medicines are a mixture...
Even Children are a mix.

393
00:30:11,648 --> 00:30:13,521
Then what is wrong
if I mix the brands?

394
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:16,382
Do whatever you want before I sleep.

395
00:30:16,568 --> 00:30:19,650
Do not disturb afterwards.
- Okay.

396
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:26,691
Hey!

397
00:30:29,045 --> 00:30:31,646
He slept before
I could drink One peg!

398
00:30:32,061 --> 00:30:34,766
A person should not
be such a gentleman!

399
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:36,530
That is why you
are called 'Rajkumar'.

400
00:30:39,678 --> 00:30:41,726
But I am not a gentleman.

401
00:31:14,885 --> 00:31:16,934
Who is playing music now?

402
00:31:17,014 --> 00:31:20,870
He is playing music after
I have finished drinking.

403
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,594
No one to question this?

404
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:27,105
I am drinking now.
Suitable song should be played.

405
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,068
Switch off!

406
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:32,649
It is switched off.

407
00:31:32,729 --> 00:31:37,813
Goodbye! You are a goodbye.

408
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,496
Who has switched on the light?

409
00:31:53,984 --> 00:31:56,842
There is a ghost here!

410
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,290
I will go and sleep near him.

411
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,742
He is sleeping peacefully.

412
00:32:06,822 --> 00:32:08,511
It is due to the power
of this sacred thread.

413
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,621
I will hold it and sleep.

414
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,121
I have seen people
stealing purse or chain.

415
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:16,356
Why are you stealing
the sacred thread?

416
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:18,529
Do not touch it.
- I am not stealing.

417
00:32:18,702 --> 00:32:21,642
I am scared.
But you will not believe me.

418
00:32:21,722 --> 00:32:24,582
I am touching the thread so
that I will also be protected by it.

419
00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:25,963
Nothing will happen. Sleep.

420
00:32:26,043 --> 00:32:29,533
I can smell liquor. Drink some more.

421
00:32:29,613 --> 00:32:31,033
You can sleep well. Get lost.

422
00:32:31,113 --> 00:32:32,854
Is it? Okay.

423
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:37,836
Liquor is over.
I will search outside.

424
00:32:41,688 --> 00:32:43,576
Keshava!

425
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,620
Who is that?!
Who is that?!

426
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,786
Keshava!
- Why are you calling me?

427
00:32:50,705 --> 00:32:52,404
Keshava!

428
00:32:52,484 --> 00:32:55,028
Leave me. Who is that?!

429
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:57,402
Keshava!

430
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:02,910
Keshava!
- Ghost!

431
00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:06,702
Ghost!

432
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:12,497
Keshava!
- It is a ghost!

433
00:33:12,636 --> 00:33:14,590
Keshava!

434
00:33:30,188 --> 00:33:31,848
Ghost!

435
00:33:32,491 --> 00:33:34,843
Not a ghost. I am Namadeva.

436
00:33:34,923 --> 00:33:39,733
I was seeing whether the
new tenant is sleeping peacefully.

437
00:33:39,813 --> 00:33:42,176
Why didn't you see from far?

438
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:44,792
I could not sleep the
whole night because of fear.

439
00:33:44,872 --> 00:33:47,124
If I see your beautiful
face I cannot sleep at all!

440
00:33:47,262 --> 00:33:50,514
Why are you keeping broom
and slippers for that reason?

441
00:33:50,594 --> 00:33:52,424
Get lost! My wish.
- Keep quiet.

442
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,279
Sir! Why are you standing?
Please sit down.

443
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:56,624
Greetings. Is everything fine?

444
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:57,994
Are you getting water in the toilet?

445
00:33:58,074 --> 00:33:59,392
That is most important for human.

446
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:02,277
Everything is fine.
- Am I not right?

447
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:07,720
The rent for this fully
furnished and convenient house

448
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,643
in a posh locality in Bengaluru
city is just Rupees 6000. How?

449
00:34:12,723 --> 00:34:16,911
Do one thing. Pay Rupees
25000 more from next month.

450
00:34:16,991 --> 00:34:19,084
Let us vacate this house
immediately on the grounds

451
00:34:19,164 --> 00:34:21,229
that the owner is
asking for more rent.

452
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,856
I feel not just two of us... One
more person is here in this house.

453
00:34:24,936 --> 00:34:26,871
You are talking wrong.

454
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:28,758
It is wrong to cook up stories

455
00:34:28,838 --> 00:34:30,246
because I asked
for the correct rent.

456
00:34:30,326 --> 00:34:32,724
Did something really
happen in this house?

457
00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:35,918
I am totally shaken
by yesterday's incident.

458
00:34:35,998 --> 00:34:37,905
You also did not allow me to
hold your sacred thread and sleep.

459
00:34:37,985 --> 00:34:41,426
So I kept this broom and
slipper here to get some sleep.

460
00:34:41,987 --> 00:34:43,461
Is it?!
- Yes.

461
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,203
Then there is a ghost in this house.

462
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,853
Let us vacate this
house immediately.

463
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:51,475
Yesterday's incident?
Do not bother about it.

464
00:34:51,728 --> 00:34:54,235
I ate more in my relative's
marriage yesterday.

465
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:58,343
May be it was the sound
effect of my stomach!

466
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,443
Do not mistake. We are one family.

467
00:35:01,523 --> 00:35:04,177
We will get some
money and lose some.

468
00:35:04,257 --> 00:35:05,505
What can we do about it?

469
00:35:05,585 --> 00:35:08,074
Right. Do not bother
about the extra rent.

470
00:35:08,154 --> 00:35:09,455
Take 6000 as rent.

471
00:35:09,535 --> 00:35:12,320
Are you going to kill
me for a lesser rent?

472
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,663
Where is the ghost? Didn't
I say that my stomach was upset?

473
00:35:15,743 --> 00:35:17,669
Tell your friend not to drink.

474
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:19,849
He has gone mad.
We have fixed 6000.

475
00:35:19,929 --> 00:35:21,344
Let it be. Let us fix that amount.

476
00:35:21,424 --> 00:35:22,485
Wasted my time.

477
00:35:22,565 --> 00:35:23,938
Give the shoe.

478
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:25,488
Not from the shoe. It is your dhoti.

479
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,218
Do not forget to take your shoe.
- They are acting.

480
00:35:27,298 --> 00:35:30,825
They don't know that
I am a drama artist.

481
00:35:30,905 --> 00:35:35,379
Super! You drove him
by cooking up a ghost story.

482
00:35:35,459 --> 00:35:36,902
I have some work. Bye.

483
00:35:37,312 --> 00:35:41,740
Hey! I did not tell story.
It was real.

484
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,656
Both of them will kill me!

485
00:35:45,071 --> 00:35:47,136
A sale s report of last month...

486
00:35:47,216 --> 00:35:49,782
Excuse me, Madam.
- Come in.

487
00:35:54,596 --> 00:35:56,389
Tell me. How can I help you?

488
00:36:05,244 --> 00:36:08,558
Your expression should not change.

489
00:36:08,822 --> 00:36:11,285
Our boys are there
around your show room.

490
00:36:16,805 --> 00:36:19,829
Tell them to give the money
which is in the counter to our boys.

491
00:36:22,935 --> 00:36:24,025
Hello
- Yes, Madam!

492
00:36:24,105 --> 00:36:28,089
Whoever comes there and
asks for anything, Give it. Okay.

493
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:31,564
O God! Save me.

494
00:36:41,522 --> 00:36:44,201
O God! You have come.

495
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:46,465
Why are you standing outside?

496
00:36:46,545 --> 00:36:48,116
Come in.

497
00:37:10,407 --> 00:37:11,985
Fast!

498
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:19,695
Fast!

499
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,564
[indistinct voice]

500
00:37:38,182 --> 00:37:39,499
O God!

501
00:37:48,806 --> 00:37:50,894
Madam! You deserve it.

502
00:37:51,123 --> 00:37:52,907
You drove away the
persons you should protect

503
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:54,576
but are allowing a
thief to sit in your cabin.

504
00:37:54,862 --> 00:37:55,925
You deserve it.

505
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:59,369
I am a journalist.
A Responsible person.

506
00:37:59,449 --> 00:38:00,486
Not just you.

507
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:02,211
Whoever was here,
I would have done the same thing.

508
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:06,077
Being human I have learnt
that we should help other humans.

509
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:09,501
If you feel like doing
good for me give the address.

510
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:13,516
That...
- You will not give.

511
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,065
Don't think otherwise...

512
00:38:19,435 --> 00:38:21,916
Poor guy! He is a very good person.

513
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:24,672
Unnecessarily I scold
him the other day.

514
00:38:25,524 --> 00:38:26,748
'So be it!'

515
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:31,946
It is true.
A boy should be like him.

516
00:38:32,902 --> 00:38:35,026
He helped me when
I was in a problem.

517
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:37,411
Now I should help him.

518
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:38,829
'So be it!'

519
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:41,631
It is true. It is true.

520
00:38:42,168 --> 00:38:45,462
O God! You are ringing
the bell so many times.

521
00:38:45,705 --> 00:38:48,229
I will go tomorrow
and give him the address.

522
00:38:48,483 --> 00:38:49,709
'So be it.'

523
00:38:57,939 --> 00:38:59,975
Hello!
- Hello! Sakshi speaking.

524
00:39:00,055 --> 00:39:01,480
You? Tell me.

525
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,906
My Assistant had your number.

526
00:39:04,483 --> 00:39:06,695
You helped me a lot yesterday.

527
00:39:06,775 --> 00:39:09,104
I called you because I am
prepared to give you the address.

528
00:39:09,184 --> 00:39:11,705
Wow! Promise on the bell
that rings in your phone.

529
00:39:11,785 --> 00:39:14,294
Yes. I took permission
from that and then called you.

530
00:39:14,374 --> 00:39:16,828
Thanks to your bell for
agreeing immediately instead

531
00:39:16,908 --> 00:39:18,207
of dragging on like a TV serial.

532
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:19,362
Where will you be?

533
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:21,962
Why should we meet to give
the address? Send a message.

534
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:26,133
If I send message, there
will be proof. And I will be caught.

535
00:39:26,509 --> 00:39:27,696
Shall I give by hand?

536
00:39:28,429 --> 00:39:30,991
I have an appointment
with the Minister today.

537
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:32,204
I will do one thing.

538
00:39:32,284 --> 00:39:33,501
Shall I send my friend?
- Okay.

539
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:36,336
No. I do not believe your friend.
Never mind.

540
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,398
Finish your work and then meet me.

541
00:39:38,478 --> 00:39:40,221
Okay. I will come
to your office directly.

542
00:39:40,487 --> 00:39:42,667
Shall we meet in a Coffee shop?

543
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,302
Coffee shop!

544
00:39:45,702 --> 00:39:46,727
Okay.

545
00:39:47,116 --> 00:39:48,174
Yes.

546
00:39:48,254 --> 00:39:52,668
Looks like you are
up to something else!

547
00:39:53,765 --> 00:39:55,678
You...! Get up.

548
00:39:56,177 --> 00:39:59,252
One minute... Bill is to be paid.

549
00:39:59,634 --> 00:40:01,236
Where is the interview?

550
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:27,087
[sanskrit shlok]

551
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,433
Ask.

552
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:34,909
Usually Politicians
are scared of God. Right?

553
00:40:35,486 --> 00:40:36,692
Not just God.

554
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:41,157
They believe and are scared
of planetary position,

555
00:40:41,237 --> 00:40:43,664
ghost, horoscope etc.

556
00:40:43,873 --> 00:40:45,975
If they had even
a small percentage of

557
00:40:46,055 --> 00:40:47,851
that devotion towards our Country,

558
00:40:47,931 --> 00:40:51,614
our Country would have
prospered a lot. Right Sir?

559
00:40:51,694 --> 00:40:53,394
'He is up to something.'

560
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:55,060
'Where is my house?'

561
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:58,723
Never mind. Let the
interview be practical. Okay?

562
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:01,389
How?
- What is your salary?

563
00:41:01,703 --> 00:41:04,713
What? Salary?
For me?

564
00:41:05,848 --> 00:41:09,760
I feel you get more income
in other ways than by salary.

565
00:41:10,379 --> 00:41:11,788
How much % do you take?

566
00:41:11,868 --> 00:41:13,328
'He is asking directly.'

567
00:41:13,408 --> 00:41:16,754
This is an interview.
Not investigation.

568
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:18,467
I am taking interview.

569
00:41:18,547 --> 00:41:20,990
I told you before that I
will take a practical interview.

570
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:24,740
Shall I eat Sandwich?

571
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:27,463
Eat. It is kept there for eating.
- Is it?

572
00:41:27,673 --> 00:41:28,865
Isn't it Sir?

573
00:41:33,098 --> 00:41:35,028
How much did you
spend for the election?

574
00:41:35,108 --> 00:41:37,144
How much did you
recover after winning?

575
00:41:38,482 --> 00:41:40,857
Taunting me!

576
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,639
Do you know what Politician means?

577
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,007
It means 'demons'.

578
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:51,797
Each letter denotes a demon.

579
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:56,232
All the qualities of these demons
combine to form the word Politician.

580
00:41:56,434 --> 00:42:00,594
Yes. We spend and make money.

581
00:42:01,267 --> 00:42:02,905
That is our job.

582
00:42:03,935 --> 00:42:06,587
But it is your job
to hide those things

583
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:08,106
and write good things about us.

584
00:42:08,589 --> 00:42:10,843
Okay Sir.
Shall I note down whatever you said?

585
00:42:12,376 --> 00:42:17,808
These words are an expression
of your unruly questions.

586
00:42:19,274 --> 00:42:23,093
Do you know what Politics means?

587
00:42:24,398 --> 00:42:29,879
Do you know how difficult it is
to win a Village Council election?

588
00:42:30,196 --> 00:42:33,698
I should be sitting in Parliament.

589
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:37,703
Do you know the hardship I had
to undergo to get the Minister post?

590
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,099
I distributed money to people

591
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:42,389
and also had to spend
for sacred rituals.

592
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:43,759
'He didn't mention about
the expenses for Priests!'

593
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:48,016
What is wrong in recovering
the money after winning?

594
00:42:48,478 --> 00:42:53,222
You were talking about
Practical Politics.

595
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:54,802
That means this.

596
00:42:54,882 --> 00:42:56,796
Tell me the things
that I should write down.

597
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:58,175
What are the developments
that you achieved?

598
00:42:58,255 --> 00:42:59,318
'Don't ask that'.

599
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:07,272
I have developed in
many foreign countries.

600
00:43:07,516 --> 00:43:09,713
I did not ask about
your personal developments.

601
00:43:10,095 --> 00:43:12,171
I am asking about the
development done to your area.

602
00:43:12,536 --> 00:43:14,774
That... Actually...

603
00:43:14,854 --> 00:43:16,096
Secretary, Give the file.

604
00:43:16,866 --> 00:43:19,688
File...
- You are in a dilemma!

605
00:43:19,768 --> 00:43:21,544
Have you not even a single
good thing that you remember?

606
00:43:23,044 --> 00:43:24,958
Do we have to pay for this?

607
00:43:26,117 --> 00:43:29,012
This is our money. Don't we pay tax?

608
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:30,586
Am I right Sir?

609
00:43:31,777 --> 00:43:35,775
Sir, Politician is not a combination

610
00:43:36,067 --> 00:43:40,121
of letters of demons, as you said.

611
00:43:40,378 --> 00:43:47,270
A Politician is a ruler who
doesn't look down upon the people.

612
00:43:49,565 --> 00:43:50,812
It can also be termed like this.

613
00:43:51,481 --> 00:43:53,671
You do all this.

614
00:43:53,751 --> 00:43:55,637
I will always write about you.

615
00:43:58,819 --> 00:44:00,198
It is true.

616
00:44:15,269 --> 00:44:18,380
Flight journey was without
any disturbance. I am happy.

617
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,735
We are in Bellary.
How to go to Bengalaru?

618
00:44:21,815 --> 00:44:23,529
Brother! Hello brother.

619
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:25,810
Convey my regards to your editor.

620
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,756
'He is sweating'.

621
00:44:27,836 --> 00:44:30,016
I don't think so.
The flight was Air conditioned.

622
00:44:30,096 --> 00:44:32,630
I was insulted in this interview.
- Sir!

623
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:36,097
It was a waste of time.
Go to Guest house directly.

624
00:44:36,308 --> 00:44:38,094
Have you changed your finger ring?

625
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:52,846
Go.

626
00:44:52,926 --> 00:44:55,125
See there!
Someone is attacking the Minister.

627
00:44:55,205 --> 00:44:56,233
You go.

628
00:44:56,313 --> 00:44:57,952
It is a fake drama
staged by the Minister.

629
00:44:58,032 --> 00:45:02,751
Why should he do like
this when I am there?

630
00:45:02,831 --> 00:45:05,167
No. I feel this is real attack.

631
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:06,558
Even you believe it?

632
00:45:06,638 --> 00:45:09,469
He is a better performer
than the film actors. Look!

633
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,270
Get in. Go.

634
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:47,059
What?
- Are you okay?

635
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:52,126
Irresponsible fellows!

636
00:47:54,299 --> 00:47:55,897
Are you saluting now?

637
00:47:56,545 --> 00:48:00,461
The security should be
very high for a Central Minister.

638
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:02,359
But here?

639
00:48:02,675 --> 00:48:05,286
He attacked me as soon
as I got down from the plane,

640
00:48:05,366 --> 00:48:07,872
in the airport,
in full public view...

641
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,859
He... He is...

642
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:18,324
If he had not come and saved me,
I would have been dead.

643
00:48:18,404 --> 00:48:19,856
Oh my God!
- Sir!

644
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:26,408
Sir. That day's attack was a fake.

645
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:27,932
I did it for gaining sympathy.

646
00:48:28,012 --> 00:48:32,076
But today it was real. Unexpected.
- It is okay.

647
00:48:32,156 --> 00:48:35,270
You are my life-giver.
Like my 2nd father.

648
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,476
Do not say so.
It gives a differeent meaning.

649
00:48:37,556 --> 00:48:42,178
I don't care.
You are my father from today.

650
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:45,235
Okay Sir.
- Ask for whatever you want.

651
00:48:45,438 --> 00:48:47,327
Do you want this airport?
My factories?

652
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:49,460
Ask whatever you want.
I will give now.

653
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,468
If you don't mind,
can you drop us back in this flight?

654
00:48:52,548 --> 00:48:53,603
I have some urgent work.

655
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:57,487
Flight is yours! Keep it.
- Sir!

656
00:48:58,022 --> 00:48:59,902
No space in my house
to park his bike.

657
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:01,305
What shall I do with this flight?

658
00:49:01,385 --> 00:49:02,497
I just need a drop.

659
00:49:02,854 --> 00:49:05,359
What a simple man!

660
00:49:06,948 --> 00:49:08,813
My father!

661
00:49:09,973 --> 00:49:11,814
Salutations. Go.

662
00:49:12,608 --> 00:49:13,621
Shall we go?
- Sure.

663
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:14,772
Come.

664
00:49:15,072 --> 00:49:17,295
2 sandwiches are left. Eat them.
- Come on!

665
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:19,727
Please close the door.
- Go inside Sir.

666
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,087
Bye.

667
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:25,452
I should know immediately
about the identity of the attacker.

668
00:49:25,532 --> 00:49:27,138
This matter should not leak out.

669
00:49:31,242 --> 00:49:33,166
The Minister told you
to ask for whatever you want.

670
00:49:33,246 --> 00:49:34,569
You could have asked
him to be my Producer.

671
00:49:34,649 --> 00:49:36,239
I would have completed my picture.

672
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:40,503
This is the start. From now
the Minister will do whatever I say.

673
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:42,287
That's true.
- Let us meet Sakshi.

674
00:49:42,367 --> 00:49:44,654
Tell her to bring her friend also.
No need.

675
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:50,703
Hello!
- Hi Sakshi!

676
00:49:50,783 --> 00:49:52,292
In which coffee shop shall we meet?

677
00:49:52,446 --> 00:49:53,549
Coffee shop!

678
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:56,063
Come to my office.

679
00:49:59,128 --> 00:50:01,041
She told me to meet at
the Coffee shop in the morning.

680
00:50:01,325 --> 00:50:03,101
Now she is telling me
to go over to her office.

681
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:05,744
Something is missing!

682
00:50:06,077 --> 00:50:09,474
'Everything will go missing
if you make missed calls!'

683
00:50:19,696 --> 00:50:20,709
Correct Madam.

684
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:23,030
You feel like staring our
Boss if you look at him once.

685
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,037
But we have work.

686
00:50:25,117 --> 00:50:26,639
If you give the address,
we will take it and go away.

687
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:28,667
I did not call you
both to give the address.

688
00:50:28,747 --> 00:50:29,782
Then?

689
00:50:29,862 --> 00:50:31,925
I got to know the secret behind
your acting as hero

690
00:50:32,005 --> 00:50:33,182
and saving me on the other day.

691
00:50:36,055 --> 00:50:41,396
An anonymous uncle warned
me against becoming a fool.

692
00:50:41,852 --> 00:50:44,751
This is the bill for that
fake attack by the rowdies.

693
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,981
Is this after deducting
your commission?

694
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:51,669
Boss, we spend so much.

695
00:50:51,749 --> 00:50:54,267
Why do you bother
for this petty money?

696
00:50:54,347 --> 00:50:56,099
Our boys acted so well!

697
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:58,880
Can you fix a price for art?
Can we?

698
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,007
Okay. Come.

699
00:51:00,087 --> 00:51:04,644
I have spent Rupees 300 for
SMS pack. You have to pay that also.

700
00:51:07,928 --> 00:51:11,642
Thieves! You not only act in
my house but also in other places.

701
00:51:11,722 --> 00:51:15,840
I will ignite the fire!

702
00:51:15,994 --> 00:51:20,388
I will inform her.

703
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:22,718
Oh! Has it turned
out to be like this?

704
00:51:22,952 --> 00:51:25,597
The owner of the ghost
house is torturing us.

705
00:51:25,768 --> 00:51:28,049
You cannot cheat me so easily.

706
00:51:28,698 --> 00:51:30,624
God is in my side.

707
00:51:35,204 --> 00:51:36,308
Hello!

708
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:39,095
What?

709
00:51:39,864 --> 00:51:41,131
What?

710
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:44,556
Father!

711
00:51:46,429 --> 00:51:47,994
Sakshi!
She has fallen!

712
00:51:51,367 --> 00:51:53,240
Hello! Sakshi!
- Someone is talking over the phone.

713
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,748
Hello!
- Hello!

714
00:51:54,828 --> 00:51:55,940
Are you listening?
- Yes.

715
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,745
Please inform that her
father suffered heart attack.

716
00:51:58,891 --> 00:52:01,186
She has fainted.
- Is it?

717
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:02,889
Call the ambulance first.

718
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:05,856
No one is responding. Do something.

719
00:52:05,936 --> 00:52:07,389
Please, sir. Please, sir.

720
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:14,151
Hello! Appaji here.

721
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:16,243
Sir, I need an urgent help from you.

722
00:52:16,617 --> 00:52:19,139
My friend's father has suffered
heart attack. Not getting ambulance.

723
00:52:19,609 --> 00:52:21,563
[sanskrit shlok]

724
00:52:21,643 --> 00:52:23,323
What are you doing, Sir?
- Chanting prayers for long life.

725
00:52:23,403 --> 00:52:26,233
First save him.
Instead why are you chanting mantra?

726
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:28,033
Don't worry.

727
00:52:28,113 --> 00:52:29,789
I will arrange
to take him in Zero traffic

728
00:52:29,869 --> 00:52:31,666
and get him admitted
in hospital immediately.

729
00:52:31,746 --> 00:52:32,752
Okay?

730
00:52:32,832 --> 00:52:33,984
Call commissioner.
- Okay sir.

731
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:35,784
Sir! What happened to Madam?

732
00:52:51,815 --> 00:52:53,779
Hi Sakshi! How are you feeling now?

733
00:52:54,937 --> 00:52:56,457
Where is father?
- He is good.

734
00:52:56,537 --> 00:52:58,566
We performed operation and have
fixed stent. So nothing to worry.

735
00:52:58,646 --> 00:52:59,691
Thanks, Doctor.

736
00:52:59,771 --> 00:53:02,599
Actually he brought
him in time in Zero traffic.

737
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,384
Thank him.
- Hi!

738
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:09,360
Feeling better?
- Thank you so much.

739
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,752
No problem. Take care.

740
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:18,248
In life,
nothing happens without a reason.

741
00:53:18,704 --> 00:53:21,390
I, being a stranger to you,
could save your father's life.

742
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:24,847
In the same way a person
entered and left my life suddenly.

743
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,874
I am curious to know about him.

744
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:28,860
That is why I asked you for address.

745
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:32,306
I am sorry If you are hurt
because of that fake rowdy attack.

746
00:53:33,665 --> 00:53:35,175
Okay? Get well soon.

747
00:57:46,935 --> 00:57:53,746
'I have fallen in love'

748
00:57:55,061 --> 00:58:00,778
'I have fallen in love'

749
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:06,212
'How did I fall?'

750
00:58:06,292 --> 00:58:10,109
'Where did I fall?'

751
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:13,994
Blood!

752
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,363
Blood!

753
00:58:19,992 --> 00:58:21,938
What happened?
- I told you there is a ghost here.

754
00:58:22,018 --> 00:58:24,918
You did not listen.
Look there. Ghost is pouring blood.

755
00:58:24,998 --> 00:58:26,580
Blood!

756
00:58:35,123 --> 00:58:37,089
Don't touch. It is blood.

757
00:58:47,907 --> 00:58:50,663
Where are you going?
He has got scared.

758
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,603
Wait. Do not be scared.

759
00:58:53,683 --> 00:58:55,142
Why is he going to the terrace?

760
00:59:14,776 --> 00:59:16,256
Father!

761
00:59:16,712 --> 00:59:19,049
You scoundrel!

762
00:59:19,129 --> 00:59:22,299
You are a rogue!

763
00:59:22,379 --> 00:59:25,029
You are cheap!

764
00:59:25,109 --> 00:59:28,050
You are so ugly.
Do you want to dye your hair?

765
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:30,662
Why have you kept the broken
dye container on the tank?

766
00:59:30,742 --> 00:59:32,607
That water is falling on me.

767
00:59:34,288 --> 00:59:35,559
Why are you scolding me?

768
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:37,253
Why are you scolding me?
I will scold. Come.

769
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:39,062
Do you think you can listen
to my scolds? - Scold.

770
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:43,162
You are like a shirt without button,
like a speaker without sound...

771
00:59:43,242 --> 00:59:44,602
Hey!
- Like a tank without water...

772
00:59:44,682 --> 00:59:45,984
Like a pen without refill...

773
00:59:46,064 --> 00:59:49,467
Like a mobile without battery...
Without seed...

774
00:59:49,547 --> 00:59:53,081
Grapes...
- Without seed...

775
00:59:53,161 --> 00:59:54,923
Yes. Shut up.

776
00:59:55,003 --> 00:59:59,852
Instead of dying your hair,
better you fall down and die.

777
01:00:00,877 --> 01:00:01,925
Leave him.

778
01:00:02,499 --> 01:00:04,879
He is the house owner. Leave him.

779
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,663
I will kill you.
- Keshava!

780
01:00:06,743 --> 01:00:08,991
Listen to me. Leave him.

781
01:00:10,374 --> 01:00:12,534
Keshava! Leave him.

782
01:00:31,582 --> 01:00:34,521
I will not spare you!

783
01:00:36,396 --> 01:00:38,474
Leave me. I will teach him a lesson.

784
01:00:38,554 --> 01:00:41,185
Leave him.
- Leave me.

785
01:00:41,791 --> 01:00:45,222
He cursed me so much
that I started shaking.

786
01:00:45,302 --> 01:00:46,990
Weird things are
happening in this house.

787
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:49,526
We are peaceful because
of the sacred thread in your hand.

788
01:00:49,777 --> 01:00:51,472
Hey...! Where is the sacred thread?

789
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:53,947
Where has it gone?

790
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:03,291
I was not scared all these days.

791
01:01:03,575 --> 01:01:05,673
I have started getting scared now.

792
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:08,744
Where has it gone?

793
01:01:08,995 --> 01:01:10,946
It must have broken and fallen
down when you both were fighting.

794
01:01:11,026 --> 01:01:13,216
Never mind.
I thought of removing it some day.

795
01:01:13,296 --> 01:01:15,730
It fell on its own.
Why are you bothered? Come.

796
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:19,532
My time is not good.

797
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:20,925
The sacred thread
has also fallen off.

798
01:01:21,005 --> 01:01:23,455
He has no belief in God or devil.

799
01:01:23,812 --> 01:01:25,395
I wonder what is going to happen!

800
01:01:44,584 --> 01:01:45,630
Hey!

801
01:01:46,465 --> 01:01:48,119
What?

802
01:01:48,735 --> 01:01:50,284
Did you wake me up?

803
01:01:50,786 --> 01:01:53,835
You woke me up.
Are you asking whether I woke you?

804
01:01:53,915 --> 01:01:55,222
Sleep.

805
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:58,571
Now that you have
lost the sacred thread,

806
01:01:58,651 --> 01:02:00,338
do you realize that there
is ghost in this house?

807
01:02:00,418 --> 01:02:02,365
Lie down.

808
01:02:03,906 --> 01:02:05,430
He will start telling ghost stories!

809
01:02:27,153 --> 01:02:28,564
Boss!

810
01:02:32,302 --> 01:02:33,486
Boss!

811
01:02:40,687 --> 01:02:43,484
Are you standing near
the door and playing tricks?

812
01:02:43,564 --> 01:02:46,687
I will not get scared.
I will not get...

813
01:02:49,175 --> 01:02:50,188
Boss!

814
01:02:57,696 --> 01:02:59,083
Boss!

815
01:03:59,827 --> 01:04:02,543
I am unable to sleep. You too?

816
01:04:02,928 --> 01:04:05,796
The time and the manner
in which you were standing

817
01:04:05,876 --> 01:04:07,915
made my heart stop beating.

818
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,469
This is the 1st time it
is happening like this in my life.

819
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:20,521
My life has become
like a horror movie.

820
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:24,040
O Lord Shiva!

821
01:04:49,766 --> 01:04:51,819
Keshava! Is this your specs?

822
01:04:51,899 --> 01:04:54,492
I don't have money for coffee.
How will I buy specs?

823
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,699
Hello Boss!

824
01:05:29,061 --> 01:05:30,642
Your new get up is excellent!

825
01:05:35,421 --> 01:05:36,994
He did not even thank me!

826
01:05:40,367 --> 01:05:41,600
Left...

827
01:05:41,924 --> 01:05:45,670
We should go left.
Why are you going straight?

828
01:05:51,801 --> 01:05:53,317
To temple?

829
01:05:54,804 --> 01:05:56,020
You got scared yesterday night.

830
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,056
So have you started
believing in God?

831
01:06:11,388 --> 01:06:14,576
We should have turned left there.
Why did we come here?

832
01:06:14,656 --> 01:06:17,541
I have been shouting since
long that we should turn left.

833
01:06:17,621 --> 01:06:19,247
I kept quiet because I thought
you wanted to come to temple.

834
01:06:19,327 --> 01:06:21,997
Temple? Me! Never.

835
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:25,715
Did I do anything?

836
01:06:25,795 --> 01:06:28,453
You did not sleep well yesterday
night. So you feel like that.

837
01:06:28,533 --> 01:06:31,827
Let us go to Office
and eat breakfast.

838
01:06:32,365 --> 01:06:33,416
Good Morning!

839
01:06:33,707 --> 01:06:34,836
Hi!
- Hello!

840
01:06:34,916 --> 01:06:36,386
Good Morning!
- Hi!

841
01:06:39,909 --> 01:06:41,037
Hi!

842
01:07:08,033 --> 01:07:09,472
Put that ad on the first page.

843
01:07:18,675 --> 01:07:20,590
Sir! You made a grave mistake.

844
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,551
If you had published the
article on the disabled people,

845
01:07:23,733 --> 01:07:25,274
it would have saved many lives.

846
01:07:25,354 --> 01:07:28,041
Which article? What are you saying?

847
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:40,426
Why are you standing here?

848
01:07:42,181 --> 01:07:43,308
Why am I sitting here?

849
01:07:45,335 --> 01:07:46,884
Good joke.
- Is it?

850
01:07:48,423 --> 01:07:49,826
Come. Sit.

851
01:07:50,117 --> 01:07:51,528
This is a very important matter.

852
01:07:53,449 --> 01:07:57,260
B SarojiDevi has got
Lifetime Achievement award.

853
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:59,173
She has given appointment
for an interview.

854
01:07:59,253 --> 01:08:00,901
Will you go and interview her?

855
01:08:00,981 --> 01:08:02,831
Sure Sir. I should be fortunate.

856
01:08:03,026 --> 01:08:04,923
Send me her address. I will do it.

857
01:08:05,003 --> 01:08:06,528
Okay. Sure.

858
01:08:10,873 --> 01:08:13,298
Sir! Did I do something before?

859
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:16,280
I was sitting and
you were standing...

860
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:20,375
Go. I will message her address. Go.

861
01:08:20,594 --> 01:08:21,770
Okay.

862
01:08:33,753 --> 01:08:35,058
Greetings!

863
01:08:38,286 --> 01:08:39,664
Greetings!

864
01:08:40,345 --> 01:08:43,321
May God bless you!
Why did you fall at my feet?

865
01:08:43,401 --> 01:08:45,600
No. I need your blessings.

866
01:08:45,964 --> 01:08:49,224
My father has explained the
reasons to fall in elders' feet.

867
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:53,254
You have gone through lot
of hardship and reached this stage.

868
01:08:53,407 --> 01:08:55,134
We should learn a lot from you.

869
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:58,061
Your father has taught
you good things.

870
01:08:58,141 --> 01:09:02,828
I am happy to give interview to you.
- Thank you, Madam.

871
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:05,925
We are reminded of you when we hear
the name of Kittur Rani Chinnamma.

872
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:09,022
You have been given
Lifetime Achievement award.

873
01:09:09,209 --> 01:09:10,263
How do you feel about it?

874
01:09:10,343 --> 01:09:13,401
I got life achievement award

875
01:09:13,481 --> 01:09:18,201
on the day people
applauded my acting.

876
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:21,930
It is due to the blessings of God.

877
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:23,340
We have no power.

878
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:25,384
Excellent words!

879
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:27,688
Dr Rajkumar said this.

880
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:33,979
When he acted in the drama Meru,
he considered his fans to be God.

881
01:09:34,182 --> 01:09:35,617
I acted with him.

882
01:09:35,697 --> 01:09:37,821
How is it possible that
I did not learn this from him?

883
01:09:37,901 --> 01:09:39,872
Even today he is
the Emperor of Acting.

884
01:09:41,608 --> 01:09:44,081
Which is your favorite film?

885
01:09:44,227 --> 01:09:45,257
Who is he?

886
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:00,579
Why do you like that film?

887
01:10:00,725 --> 01:10:04,993
Because I acted with
both Evergreen Superstar

888
01:10:05,073 --> 01:10:09,058
and Future Superstar in that movie.

889
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:19,721
It was a golden experience.

890
01:10:30,632 --> 01:10:31,818
What happened?

891
01:10:34,505 --> 01:10:36,268
What happened?

892
01:10:36,592 --> 01:10:38,173
What is it?

893
01:11:10,298 --> 01:11:11,697
Who are you?

894
01:11:18,103 --> 01:11:20,008
Why are you hitting me?

895
01:11:27,498 --> 01:11:28,886
Why did you kill me?

896
01:11:33,336 --> 01:11:34,492
Stop!

897
01:11:35,618 --> 01:11:36,890
Why did you kill me?

898
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:38,563
Why did you kill me?

899
01:11:39,019 --> 01:11:40,600
Sir, sir.

900
01:12:06,151 --> 01:12:07,438
Why did you kill me?

901
01:12:07,892 --> 01:12:09,198
Why did you kill me?

902
01:12:09,392 --> 01:12:11,379
Was it a mistake to ask for Justice?

903
01:12:22,343 --> 01:12:23,449
Who is he?

904
01:12:23,595 --> 01:12:25,223
Why is he hitting me?
- What happened?

905
01:12:59,368 --> 01:13:01,786
Sir! Leave him.

906
01:13:34,612 --> 01:13:35,663
Move.

907
01:14:25,292 --> 01:14:26,473
What happened?

908
01:14:31,091 --> 01:14:32,705
What happened to me?

909
01:14:52,432 --> 01:14:55,278
Shall we finish the deal between us?
No.

910
01:14:56,007 --> 01:14:58,148
Shall I pay Five hundred more?

911
01:14:58,537 --> 01:14:59,778
Two hundred more?

912
01:14:59,858 --> 01:15:02,048
Yes. Deal over.

913
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:05,687
Boss!

914
01:15:12,297 --> 01:15:13,925
Did I do anything?

915
01:15:14,678 --> 01:15:16,813
Why...?
- What are you saying?

916
01:15:16,893 --> 01:15:18,421
Gagan!
- Really.

917
01:15:18,501 --> 01:15:20,154
What happened exactly?

918
01:15:22,729 --> 01:15:23,864
What happened?

919
01:15:24,131 --> 01:15:25,694
Why have you come here?

920
01:15:25,882 --> 01:15:28,755
Sir! He is acting crazy.

921
01:15:29,547 --> 01:15:31,649
Why did you hit him?

922
01:15:31,729 --> 01:15:35,275
Hit? Me? Did I hit B. Saroja Devi?

923
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:39,634
Not Saroja Devi. You hit
Prabhakar Reddy, VIP guest there.

924
01:15:39,714 --> 01:15:42,157
He is a famous criminal lawyer.
Why did you hit him?

925
01:15:42,294 --> 01:15:43,351
Me?

926
01:15:43,431 --> 01:15:45,122
Luckily that person
did not complain.

927
01:15:45,349 --> 01:15:47,301
Somehow I erased it
from the CCTC footage.

928
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:48,475
Why should I hit him?

929
01:15:48,555 --> 01:15:50,596
This is the first time
I am hearing his name.

930
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:53,775
I was interviewing Madam.
Where is she now?

931
01:15:53,855 --> 01:15:57,115
She got tensed when you hit him.
So now she is taking drips.

932
01:15:57,195 --> 01:15:58,724
Is it?

933
01:15:58,892 --> 01:16:00,637
Sir, I will first go
and finish her interview.

934
01:16:27,335 --> 01:16:28,622
Why did he hit him?

935
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,521
Why did he hit?
- Why should I hit a stranger?

936
01:16:31,601 --> 01:16:34,693
I am not such a person.
Everyone except me has become mad.

937
01:16:34,773 --> 01:16:36,589
Don't know what to do.

938
01:16:36,906 --> 01:16:38,062
Please.

939
01:16:40,504 --> 01:16:41,772
Dr! This...
- Give after an hour.

940
01:16:41,852 --> 01:16:42,901
Okay.

941
01:16:44,132 --> 01:16:45,825
Why have you lied down?

942
01:16:45,905 --> 01:16:48,225
Did I ask any question that you
had to inject glucose to yourself?

943
01:16:48,426 --> 01:16:49,587
What is your name?

944
01:16:49,667 --> 01:16:51,423
I told you. Gagan Dikshit.

945
01:16:51,503 --> 01:16:54,841
No. We should call
you Emperor of actors!

946
01:16:55,017 --> 01:16:57,170
Emperor of actors! Me?

947
01:16:57,455 --> 01:16:58,902
What are you saying?

948
01:16:58,982 --> 01:17:01,846
Are you acting before me?

949
01:17:01,989 --> 01:17:03,643
Why did you hit him?

950
01:17:03,825 --> 01:17:05,583
'She is also saying the same thing.'

951
01:17:06,764 --> 01:17:08,749
I promise I don't
know what happened.

952
01:17:09,034 --> 01:17:11,200
Please forgive me if
I had done anything wrong.

953
01:17:11,589 --> 01:17:14,696
My career as Journalist is a waste
if I do not complete your interview!

954
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:16,395
Forget about it.

955
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:18,893
Which is your favorite food?

956
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,683
Favorite film? Favorite color?

957
01:17:20,923 --> 01:17:22,415
Mother... Please Mother.

958
01:17:23,109 --> 01:17:24,432
Please. Please Mother.

959
01:17:24,952 --> 01:17:27,255
Please Mother...

960
01:17:27,335 --> 01:17:29,117
Please Mother...

961
01:17:30,382 --> 01:17:34,150
You look like a small boy to me.

962
01:17:35,272 --> 01:17:36,355
Ask.

963
01:18:05,262 --> 01:18:06,331
Greetings Sir!

964
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:11,910
Who... Who bashed you like this?

965
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:15,969
You came for my birthday.
Who made you lie down in hospital?

966
01:18:16,534 --> 01:18:18,449
I do not know him.

967
01:18:18,958 --> 01:18:21,921
I am seeing him for the 1st time.

968
01:18:22,108 --> 01:18:23,291
But...

969
01:18:24,474 --> 01:18:25,688
Okay Sir.

970
01:18:27,001 --> 01:18:28,029
Say now.

971
01:18:28,109 --> 01:18:31,350
The words he spoke when
he hit me are connected to me,

972
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:36,404
you and our illegal business.

973
01:18:36,484 --> 01:18:37,760
Is it?
- Yes.

974
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,786
I did not give Police
complaint for that reason.

975
01:18:42,076 --> 01:18:46,243
I am a Lawyer.
Still I am ashamed of myself.

976
01:18:46,928 --> 01:18:48,672
I will find out details
about him after my birthday

977
01:18:49,435 --> 01:18:53,632
celebrations are over today evening.

978
01:18:54,151 --> 01:18:55,703
I will find him also.

979
01:19:00,576 --> 01:19:02,368
What are you doing?

980
01:19:02,554 --> 01:19:05,749
If the owner sees you fixing
nail to the wall, he will smash you.

981
01:19:05,829 --> 01:19:08,838
Let him do anything to me.
You first become alright.

982
01:19:08,918 --> 01:19:10,403
You...!

983
01:19:12,155 --> 01:19:14,612
I am observing since yesterday.
What has happened to me?

984
01:19:14,692 --> 01:19:16,801
Show a single evidence to
prove that I am acting strange.

985
01:19:16,955 --> 01:19:19,680
Give me time table of your behavior.

986
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,544
I will call the
cameraman and shoot it.

987
01:19:21,624 --> 01:19:24,536
I don't change with time.
I remain the same.

988
01:19:24,616 --> 01:19:27,755
Wait.
You say.

989
01:19:27,835 --> 01:19:30,049
Don't we miss something
after coming to this house?

990
01:19:30,129 --> 01:19:32,831
We lost the sacred thread,
sleep and peace of mind.

991
01:19:32,911 --> 01:19:34,343
Don't you think that bad things are

992
01:19:34,423 --> 01:19:35,936
happening after coming
to this house?

993
01:19:36,016 --> 01:19:37,199
Who said so?

994
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:40,119
Minister became our friend
after coming to this house.

995
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:41,299
Sakshi agreed to give the address.

996
01:19:41,379 --> 01:19:43,088
Got a chance to interview B.
Sarojadevi.

997
01:19:43,248 --> 01:19:44,603
We should be positive.

998
01:19:44,683 --> 01:19:46,061
Only then we will feel like
living in heaven even

999
01:19:46,141 --> 01:19:47,801
if we are in a cemetery.

1000
01:19:48,203 --> 01:19:49,676
Look! Phone is ringing.

1001
01:19:50,162 --> 01:19:51,887
Is everything true
if the phone rings?

1002
01:19:51,967 --> 01:19:53,737
You have become like that girl.

1003
01:19:54,029 --> 01:19:55,456
Minister is calling.

1004
01:19:56,694 --> 01:19:58,166
Hello!
- Hello!

1005
01:19:58,246 --> 01:19:59,444
How are you?
- Super Sir!

1006
01:19:59,524 --> 01:20:02,187
You should come to my 5 star hotel
in the evening. - Why Sir?

1007
01:20:02,369 --> 01:20:05,223
If you had not saved
my life in the airport,

1008
01:20:05,303 --> 01:20:08,674
I would not be celebrating
my birthday today.

1009
01:20:09,134 --> 01:20:11,664
It would have been my funeral today.
- I will surely come.

1010
01:20:12,053 --> 01:20:15,192
My friend is a Film Director.

1011
01:20:15,406 --> 01:20:16,807
I will introduce him to you there.

1012
01:20:16,887 --> 01:20:19,603
Sure. Your friends are my friends.

1013
01:20:19,895 --> 01:20:21,069
Done Sir. Bye.

1014
01:20:22,256 --> 01:20:23,502
Boss!

1015
01:20:23,582 --> 01:20:25,759
I said this is an
unlucky house by mistake.

1016
01:20:25,839 --> 01:20:28,237
Minister birthday is being
celebrated in the evening.

1017
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:29,613
Shall I tell about your film?

1018
01:20:29,693 --> 01:20:32,740
We are in an unlucky house!
- You are right.

1019
01:20:33,012 --> 01:20:35,178
My luck has changed
after coming to this house.

1020
01:20:35,258 --> 01:20:36,573
I am going to settle down in life.

1021
01:20:36,653 --> 01:20:37,805
You are laying
the foundation for that.

1022
01:20:37,885 --> 01:20:39,758
This is really God's house.

1023
01:20:40,284 --> 01:20:42,022
You change according
to the circumstance.

1024
01:20:42,102 --> 01:20:45,674
That is why even though you believe
in God, God doesn't believe in you.

1025
01:20:57,977 --> 01:20:59,832
I will send message at midnight.

1026
01:21:00,166 --> 01:21:01,626
Hello Sir!
- Hello!

1027
01:21:01,706 --> 01:21:04,089
I am reminded of a
proverb when I see this.

1028
01:21:04,971 --> 01:21:07,342
Is it?
- Knowledge is better than show off!

1029
01:21:07,592 --> 01:21:10,440
I would have finished a movie
with the cost of the decoration.

1030
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:11,859
Introduce me to the Minister.

1031
01:21:11,939 --> 01:21:13,785
I have brought you here.

1032
01:21:13,865 --> 01:21:16,369
Show your skills here.
- Okay.

1033
01:21:17,687 --> 01:21:19,046
Bar!

1034
01:21:19,126 --> 01:21:21,802
I should drink little if
I have to show off my skills.

1035
01:21:21,882 --> 01:21:24,873
Do not drink liquor and act like
a loafer. Media is here.

1036
01:21:24,953 --> 01:21:26,941
I would have acted like
a loafer if I had come alone.

1037
01:21:27,021 --> 01:21:29,352
But I have come along with you.
I will behave decently. Okay?

1038
01:21:29,543 --> 01:21:30,799
Okay.
- Thank you.

1039
01:21:31,432 --> 01:21:33,110
Sir!
- Hi Sir!

1040
01:21:33,418 --> 01:21:34,675
Welcome Sir.

1041
01:21:34,967 --> 01:21:39,751
Please come. Minister
has been enquiring about you.

1042
01:21:39,831 --> 01:21:43,766
Where is Sir?
His spiritual leader has advised him

1043
01:21:43,846 --> 01:21:46,270
not to get out of the
room before 8 o'clock.

1044
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:47,980
What will happen if he comes before?

1045
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:50,453
His life will be in danger.

1046
01:21:51,442 --> 01:21:54,507
We wanted to engage
the guests till then.

1047
01:21:54,587 --> 01:21:57,263
So we have arranged
for bar and band.

1048
01:21:58,415 --> 01:22:00,069
Arrangements are good.
- Juice!

1049
01:22:01,358 --> 01:22:02,590
Thank you.

1050
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,591
Did you mix something?

1051
01:22:09,531 --> 01:22:10,634
No!

1052
01:22:20,987 --> 01:22:22,396
Hope you did not mix anything.

1053
01:22:23,076 --> 01:22:25,042
I will not be in
my senses if I drink.

1054
01:22:25,122 --> 01:22:26,482
What will you do?

1055
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:30,178
Increase the tempo slightly.

1056
01:22:30,535 --> 01:22:32,668
Tempo! Why will tempo come here?

1057
01:22:32,748 --> 01:22:33,949
Not that tempo.

1058
01:22:34,029 --> 01:22:35,319
Then which one?

1059
01:27:06,329 --> 01:27:08,169
Hi!

1060
01:27:08,567 --> 01:27:09,832
Hi!
- Hi!

1061
01:27:09,912 --> 01:27:16,748
Our Central Minister
Ghanashyam Yadav

1062
01:27:16,828 --> 01:27:19,691
will arrive in a few seconds.

1063
01:27:20,992 --> 01:27:24,802
Minister will come now.
I am sweating a lot.

1064
01:27:26,038 --> 01:27:27,458
Give the coat.

1065
01:27:27,538 --> 01:27:32,039
Happy Birthday to you!

1066
01:27:32,464 --> 01:27:35,302
Happy Birthday to you!

1067
01:27:35,668 --> 01:27:38,637
Happy Birthday to you!

1068
01:27:43,685 --> 01:27:45,612
Come on. Bring cake.

1069
01:27:51,352 --> 01:27:53,289
Sir.
- Where is Appaji?

1070
01:27:54,092 --> 01:27:57,035
He was singing and dancing till now.

1071
01:27:58,301 --> 01:27:59,728
Look! He is there.

1072
01:28:09,799 --> 01:28:12,337
How come this specs is here?

1073
01:28:21,603 --> 01:28:22,951
Who is that?

1074
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:27,288
Appaji! Hi!

1075
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:32,933
Appaji!

1076
01:28:51,054 --> 01:28:52,736
Take your hand off.

1077
01:28:53,547 --> 01:28:55,007
What did you say?

1078
01:28:55,087 --> 01:28:57,054
I said Take off your hand.

1079
01:29:12,935 --> 01:29:15,043
Why did you become silent?

1080
01:29:15,205 --> 01:29:16,797
This is birthday bash.

1081
01:29:16,877 --> 01:29:19,047
Was it really birthday bash?

1082
01:29:19,127 --> 01:29:21,985
Yes. Birthday bash. Applaud.

1083
01:29:22,757 --> 01:29:25,100
Cheers to Central Minister!

1084
01:29:25,313 --> 01:29:26,965
Cheers to Birthday boy!

1085
01:29:27,045 --> 01:29:28,304
Cheers to Birthday boy!

1086
01:29:28,384 --> 01:29:29,996
Cheers to Birthday boy!

1087
01:29:30,076 --> 01:29:32,875
Cheers to Birthday boy!

1088
01:29:33,310 --> 01:29:34,698
What is this?

1089
01:29:35,043 --> 01:29:38,803
Everyone apply cake on the face,
on birthday,

1090
01:29:38,883 --> 01:29:41,702
but you have dug
my face into the cake.

1091
01:29:42,269 --> 01:29:45,269
Never mind. You are my friend.

1092
01:29:45,349 --> 01:29:48,401
You are the savior of my life.

1093
01:29:48,715 --> 01:29:52,060
I love you.
I love you.

1094
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,197
Appaji!

1095
01:30:35,812 --> 01:30:37,036
Sir!

1096
01:30:37,662 --> 01:30:39,314
Sir!

1097
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:41,462
No Sir!

1098
01:31:45,744 --> 01:31:46,930
No Sir!

1099
01:31:51,874 --> 01:31:53,601
Sir! Do not beat him.

1100
01:31:58,725 --> 01:32:00,233
Why are you hitting me?

1101
01:32:00,313 --> 01:32:02,750
Leave me. You are my friend.

1102
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:06,262
Leave me.
Why?

1103
01:32:25,686 --> 01:32:27,348
Why did you kill me?

1104
01:32:27,683 --> 01:32:30,684
I asked for Justice. Was it wrong?

1105
01:32:31,454 --> 01:32:33,177
I want your life.

1106
01:32:33,379 --> 01:32:34,778
I want your life.

1107
01:32:34,991 --> 01:32:36,177
Want your life.

1108
01:32:38,964 --> 01:32:40,829
Are you hitting the Minister?

1109
01:32:51,167 --> 01:32:52,676
Ghost attack on Ghanashyam Yadav.

1110
01:32:52,756 --> 01:32:54,613
Breaking news...

1111
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,435
Attack on Central
Minister Ghanashyam Yadav.

1112
01:32:57,515 --> 01:33:00,441
During the birthday party of the
Minister, Journalist Gagan Dikshit

1113
01:33:00,521 --> 01:33:04,350
attacked the Minister in front
of the press, public and the Police.

1114
01:33:04,951 --> 01:33:06,134
It was him who hit me.

1115
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:07,399
It was him.

1116
01:33:09,272 --> 01:33:12,807
Was it him who hit you also?
- Yes.

1117
01:33:14,493 --> 01:33:17,639
I started the party after 8p.m.
as advised by my spiritual leader.

1118
01:33:18,303 --> 01:33:19,746
Still why did this happen?

1119
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:24,448
I should know the effects
of the planetary position on me.

1120
01:33:26,338 --> 01:33:28,422
Unwanted things are happening.

1121
01:33:29,427 --> 01:33:30,651
Where is spiritual leader?

1122
01:33:31,049 --> 01:33:32,492
That...

1123
01:33:32,996 --> 01:33:35,117
The person who saved
me is now attacking me.

1124
01:33:35,197 --> 01:33:36,965
There should be a reason behind it.

1125
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:41,153
Where is my Guru?
- He is coming.

1126
01:33:41,302 --> 01:33:43,597
Planetary position... Stars...!

1127
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:46,774
Do not talk like a fool.

1128
01:33:47,829 --> 01:33:50,877
He has come to our
place and hit both of us.

1129
01:33:50,957 --> 01:33:52,207
What does it mean?

1130
01:33:52,905 --> 01:33:56,051
We should send our
boys to attack him.

1131
01:33:57,129 --> 01:33:58,726
Give the phone.
- Take.

1132
01:34:01,734 --> 01:34:03,405
Where is he now?

1133
01:34:05,164 --> 01:34:07,443
Move to that side.
Sir is scolding us.

1134
01:34:07,523 --> 01:34:08,870
You are disturbing us.

1135
01:34:10,962 --> 01:34:13,613
'I do not remember
what I did after drinking.'

1136
01:34:15,422 --> 01:34:17,263
Wait. I will ask Sir.

1137
01:34:17,343 --> 01:34:18,471
Okay.

1138
01:34:23,482 --> 01:34:24,730
Bail papers.

1139
01:34:25,768 --> 01:34:27,487
He is mentally ill.

1140
01:34:27,641 --> 01:34:29,012
That is the reason
he is behaving like that.

1141
01:34:29,092 --> 01:34:30,108
Constable!

1142
01:34:30,188 --> 01:34:31,256
Sir.
- Come here.

1143
01:34:31,336 --> 01:34:34,111
I am not bothered if people comment

1144
01:34:34,191 --> 01:34:37,776
that you are in lock
up and that you are mad.

1145
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:42,375
But you lost the sacred
thread which I had tied

1146
01:34:42,455 --> 01:34:45,241
to your hand without
knowing its value.

1147
01:34:45,321 --> 01:34:47,246
I feel bad about it.

1148
01:34:48,732 --> 01:34:52,617
I am unable to believe
till now that I hit the Minister.

1149
01:34:53,123 --> 01:34:55,244
Why should I hit him?

1150
01:34:55,426 --> 01:34:57,936
Minister fondly calls me Appaji.

1151
01:34:58,150 --> 01:34:59,798
Ask Keshav if you want.

1152
01:34:59,954 --> 01:35:02,432
Who? Your friend?

1153
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:06,246
He is talking rubbish in
front of TV crew. Do you know that?

1154
01:35:06,396 --> 01:35:09,321
Problem started from the
moment he lost the sacred thread.

1155
01:35:09,401 --> 01:35:12,156
There is a ghost in that house.
He is possessed by evil spirit.

1156
01:35:13,532 --> 01:35:14,713
Nonsense!

1157
01:35:14,793 --> 01:35:17,657
He is cooking up stories
because his picture is half done.

1158
01:35:17,793 --> 01:35:22,107
He is not cooking up stories.
See this. You will know. Take.

1159
01:35:38,801 --> 01:35:39,865
Me!

1160
01:36:11,809 --> 01:36:14,014
Latest developments of
ghost attack on Ganeshyam Yadav!

1161
01:36:14,094 --> 01:36:15,700
Gagan Dikshit has
been sanctioned bail.

1162
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:17,646
He is coming out of the station now.

1163
01:36:17,726 --> 01:36:20,675
Is he really possessed or is he mad?

1164
01:36:20,755 --> 01:36:22,128
Let us ask him. Come.

1165
01:36:25,235 --> 01:36:27,718
Go back.
Go to that side.

1166
01:36:51,823 --> 01:36:52,844
Ghana!

1167
01:36:53,478 --> 01:36:55,197
Swami!
- Relax.

1168
01:36:55,886 --> 01:36:57,613
Have you come? Welcome.

1169
01:36:57,986 --> 01:37:01,448
He hit your devotee mercilessly.

1170
01:37:01,708 --> 01:37:03,946
I have a small doubt.

1171
01:37:04,287 --> 01:37:07,490
Is he my friend or foe?
I am unable to understand.

1172
01:37:07,570 --> 01:37:11,819
Look at him.
They both do not know each other.

1173
01:37:11,965 --> 01:37:13,570
But he has hit him violently.

1174
01:37:14,381 --> 01:37:16,132
You should save us.

1175
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:17,827
It is not him.

1176
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:21,338
He did not hit.

1177
01:37:21,598 --> 01:37:22,653
Hello!

1178
01:37:22,733 --> 01:37:25,077
Reporter Gagan Dikshit
has been granted bail.

1179
01:37:25,157 --> 01:37:26,407
Is it?
- Yes Sir.

1180
01:37:26,487 --> 01:37:27,623
What?

1181
01:37:28,572 --> 01:37:30,031
He has got bail.

1182
01:37:30,111 --> 01:37:31,199
Bail!

1183
01:37:31,945 --> 01:37:34,277
Reporter Gagan Dikshit,
who attacked the Minister,

1184
01:37:34,357 --> 01:37:35,559
has been granted bail.

1185
01:37:35,715 --> 01:37:37,693
Gagan Dikshit has now
managed to get bail

1186
01:37:37,773 --> 01:37:39,445
and come out of the Police station.

1187
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:42,242
This is your Junior Lawyer's house.
Right?

1188
01:37:42,493 --> 01:37:45,574
This house is well known as
the haunted house of the street.

1189
01:37:46,418 --> 01:37:48,493
It was here that we...
- Yes.

1190
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:51,166
Why did the spirit
attack the Minister?

1191
01:37:51,246 --> 01:37:52,350
Has he done any harm?

1192
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:53,631
This is the truth.

1193
01:37:54,693 --> 01:37:56,299
This is the act of soul.

1194
01:37:56,379 --> 01:37:57,596
Soul!

1195
01:37:57,676 --> 01:37:59,923
Your sinful deeds are affecting you.

1196
01:38:00,928 --> 01:38:03,369
It should be solved soon.

1197
01:38:04,317 --> 01:38:07,041
Otherwise I will not be
responsible for the future events.

1198
01:38:07,219 --> 01:38:10,146
Swami! Please tell us.
What should we do?

1199
01:38:18,058 --> 01:38:19,923
The reported who attacked

1200
01:38:20,003 --> 01:38:22,348
the Minister Ghaneshyam
Yadav has got bail and come home.

1201
01:38:22,428 --> 01:38:23,929
This is his house.

1202
01:38:24,205 --> 01:38:25,916
It has been only two
weeks since he came here.

1203
01:38:26,354 --> 01:38:28,827
This is called haunted
house of the street.

1204
01:38:28,907 --> 01:38:31,300
A person committed
suicide in this house.

1205
01:38:31,543 --> 01:38:35,070
Is that spirit troubling Gagan now?

1206
01:38:35,256 --> 01:38:37,048
If it is true that
there are spirits,

1207
01:38:37,331 --> 01:38:39,262
why is it trying
to kill the Minister?

1208
01:38:39,342 --> 01:38:41,167
Minister has to answer
these questions.

1209
01:38:44,759 --> 01:38:46,697
You have done a big mistake.

1210
01:38:46,777 --> 01:38:48,692
You have given Mental
Illness as the reason.

1211
01:38:48,772 --> 01:38:50,776
Doesn't it amount to
admitting that he is mad?

1212
01:38:51,432 --> 01:38:53,580
I did not have any other option.

1213
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:54,699
No other option?

1214
01:38:54,779 --> 01:38:58,745
He did not hit some ordinary fellow.

1215
01:38:58,825 --> 01:39:00,253
He has hit a Central Minister.

1216
01:39:00,593 --> 01:39:03,893
Court would not have agreed
for any reason other than that.

1217
01:39:03,973 --> 01:39:05,896
You have made a mistake.
- Hello, Sir!

1218
01:39:06,106 --> 01:39:08,515
Get up. Vacate the house first.
Vacate it.

1219
01:39:08,782 --> 01:39:10,208
Before your arrival, only the people

1220
01:39:10,288 --> 01:39:11,815
in this street knew
this house is haunted.

1221
01:39:11,895 --> 01:39:14,595
Now the whole country knows.
You Vacate the house.

1222
01:39:14,675 --> 01:39:17,222
We will surely vacate.
We will not remain here permanently.

1223
01:39:17,302 --> 01:39:19,160
This is a haunted house.
Get up, My son.

1224
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:20,717
Will you keep queit?

1225
01:39:26,563 --> 01:39:29,336
You speak about ghosts.
I do not believe in that.

1226
01:39:29,604 --> 01:39:31,003
I am searching for
answers to questions

1227
01:39:31,083 --> 01:39:32,320
which I fail to understand.

1228
01:39:33,577 --> 01:39:35,944
You said I hit that lawyer.
But none of you proved it.

1229
01:39:36,131 --> 01:39:38,141
I do not know why
I hit the Minister.

1230
01:39:38,345 --> 01:39:40,628
He gave me liquor to drink.
Why don't you think logically

1231
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:42,496
that the problem might have
happened because I was drunk?

1232
01:39:43,048 --> 01:39:45,570
Instead why are you connecting
it to the suicide of this house,

1233
01:39:45,650 --> 01:39:48,764
me or to others problems?

1234
01:39:49,308 --> 01:39:51,278
Sakshi! You please explain to them.

1235
01:39:52,762 --> 01:39:54,586
Even I did not believe it initially.

1236
01:39:57,611 --> 01:39:58,884
But...

1237
01:39:59,817 --> 01:40:04,139
You are being possessed
by some spirit, as they say.

1238
01:40:04,219 --> 01:40:06,442
What? What nonsense?

1239
01:40:06,961 --> 01:40:09,385
I have to go upstairs.

1240
01:40:09,465 --> 01:40:14,387
This house and the address
you are searching for are the same.

1241
01:40:16,909 --> 01:40:18,190
You should not go there.

1242
01:40:18,481 --> 01:40:19,641
See.

1243
01:40:31,374 --> 01:40:32,883
Was Shruthi staying in this house?

1244
01:40:33,239 --> 01:40:34,407
Shruthi!

1245
01:40:35,007 --> 01:40:36,134
Shruthi!

1246
01:40:37,991 --> 01:40:39,102
Shruthi!

1247
01:40:41,493 --> 01:40:45,020
Why are you troubling these
people instead of coming to me?

1248
01:40:45,555 --> 01:40:47,631
Why did you commit suicide?

1249
01:40:47,988 --> 01:40:52,074
You loved life.
Why did you commit suicide?

1250
01:40:52,496 --> 01:40:54,985
I don't know why
she committed suicide.

1251
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:57,636
I don't know the relation
between you and her.

1252
01:40:57,716 --> 01:40:59,314
But you should be
possessed by Shruthi.

1253
01:40:59,510 --> 01:41:02,729
You should tell me
the reason why she died.

1254
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:04,325
Shruthi!

1255
01:41:05,306 --> 01:41:06,676
Shruthi!

1256
01:41:07,877 --> 01:41:09,214
Shruthi!

1257
01:41:10,568 --> 01:41:14,038
Media people are saying
that Minister killed her.

1258
01:41:14,118 --> 01:41:17,784
Shruthi's spirit should
take revenge on her death.

1259
01:41:17,864 --> 01:41:19,949
Shruthi! Shruthi!

1260
01:41:29,477 --> 01:41:30,637
Gagan!

1261
01:41:31,893 --> 01:41:33,976
Tears in your eyes!

1262
01:41:34,804 --> 01:41:37,285
I have never seen you crying.

1263
01:41:37,683 --> 01:41:39,029
Why are you crying?

1264
01:41:39,109 --> 01:41:41,373
What happened? Who is Shruthi?

1265
01:41:49,351 --> 01:41:52,400
I had written an article about

1266
01:41:53,802 --> 01:41:55,870
'Disabled funds
allotment' one year back.

1267
01:41:56,405 --> 01:41:58,034
She passed a wonderful
comment about the article

1268
01:41:58,213 --> 01:42:00,361
which was even better
than the article.

1269
01:42:00,792 --> 01:42:02,073
She is Shruthi.

1270
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:15,174
Our friendship started
and we exchanged our numbers.

1271
01:42:15,596 --> 01:42:18,945
I started loving Shruthi.

1272
01:42:27,969 --> 01:42:31,714
Two months back, I got time
to meet her for the first time.

1273
01:42:32,347 --> 01:42:33,895
At the Kolkata airport.

1274
01:43:10,505 --> 01:43:12,836
Flight got delayed. Shall we go?

1275
01:43:13,874 --> 01:43:16,560
From which side should I come?
- Oh! Sorry.

1276
01:43:16,877 --> 01:43:18,220
Come to that side.

1277
01:43:38,278 --> 01:43:40,508
How come you have
suddenly come to Kolkata?

1278
01:43:40,654 --> 01:43:41,846
I felt like seeing you.

1279
01:43:43,387 --> 01:43:46,476
I can't bear to hear this white lie!

1280
01:43:46,947 --> 01:43:48,893
Tell me the real
reason for your coming.

1281
01:43:48,973 --> 01:43:50,206
It is true.

1282
01:43:50,450 --> 01:43:53,263
I have come to see you.
- Okay. I believe.

1283
01:43:53,539 --> 01:43:56,815
Which hotel have
you booked in Kolkata?

1284
01:43:56,895 --> 01:43:58,842
I have not booked any hotel.

1285
01:43:59,329 --> 01:44:00,529
Are you joking?

1286
01:44:00,609 --> 01:44:02,158
You have come here
during festival season.

1287
01:44:02,238 --> 01:44:04,346
You will not get
hotel accommodation.

1288
01:44:04,426 --> 01:44:05,807
It is very crowded here.

1289
01:44:05,887 --> 01:44:09,083
Will you not take me to your house?

1290
01:44:15,569 --> 01:44:18,463
Boss! Are you thinking that I am
saying whatever you wanted to say?

1291
01:44:18,543 --> 01:44:21,512
I feel excited.

1292
01:44:21,592 --> 01:44:23,442
Please... Tell me the truth.

1293
01:44:23,522 --> 01:44:25,460
Did you really come
to Kolkata to see me?

1294
01:44:27,188 --> 01:44:28,623
Shall we go?

1295
01:44:29,449 --> 01:44:30,812
Really!

1296
01:44:43,698 --> 01:44:44,711
Come.

1297
01:44:44,791 --> 01:44:47,461
Gagan! What is the matter?
Brought a girl!

1298
01:44:47,777 --> 01:44:49,528
No. We are friends.

1299
01:44:49,608 --> 01:44:51,166
Oh!

1300
01:44:51,246 --> 01:44:53,793
This is a chawl.

1301
01:44:55,366 --> 01:44:56,607
Be careful.

1302
01:44:58,738 --> 01:45:03,473
3rd door is my house.
I will call you.

1303
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:07,089
Okay fine.

1304
01:45:07,568 --> 01:45:08,654
2 minutes.

1305
01:45:08,734 --> 01:45:11,184
Coming.
- 'The house must be in disarray.'

1306
01:45:18,059 --> 01:45:21,416
'I realize the house is
untidy only when guests come.'

1307
01:45:21,496 --> 01:45:24,100
'Let me squeeze it in.
Will look like another cusion.'

1308
01:45:25,794 --> 01:45:27,773
'I didn't understand these books.'

1309
01:45:28,194 --> 01:45:29,848
'I could have at least sold them.'

1310
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:36,269
'Let me keep this
here for the time being.'

1311
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:38,311
'This is old cloth.'

1312
01:45:39,243 --> 01:45:40,540
What is this?

1313
01:45:51,414 --> 01:45:55,184
'House will look clean if
I keep these books on the shelf.'

1314
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:00,551
Have you come?

1315
01:46:00,738 --> 01:46:03,097
Why so urgent?
Do you want to use the toilet?

1316
01:46:03,177 --> 01:46:04,192
It is towards the right.

1317
01:46:04,272 --> 01:46:07,784
No. Need one week to clean
your room. Not 2 minutes.

1318
01:46:07,930 --> 01:46:11,668
Never mind. I will adjust.

1319
01:46:11,903 --> 01:46:15,609
Thank you so much. This is
Bachelor's room. You have to adjust.

1320
01:46:15,689 --> 01:46:20,074
I am not the person
who is decent enough

1321
01:46:20,154 --> 01:46:22,997
to ask you sleep on the
bed and will lie on the floor.

1322
01:46:23,077 --> 01:46:25,614
Because you have
come here voluntarily.

1323
01:46:25,694 --> 01:46:29,175
I will sleep on the bed.
You adjust on sofa.

1324
01:46:29,476 --> 01:46:30,774
Okay. No problem.

1325
01:46:30,854 --> 01:46:32,873
Have you agreed so soon?

1326
01:46:32,953 --> 01:46:36,537
I thought you will argue
and fight since you are a lawyer.

1327
01:46:36,717 --> 01:46:39,100
Lawyers do not argue
with the person they love.

1328
01:46:42,887 --> 01:46:44,630
Sorry.
- Tea.

1329
01:46:45,076 --> 01:46:46,787
Yes. Tea. Sure.

1330
01:46:47,836 --> 01:46:49,995
Please change. Relax.
- Sure.

1331
01:46:50,075 --> 01:46:51,921
Make yourself comfortable.
- Okay.

1332
01:47:02,714 --> 01:47:05,552
Tell me the truth now.
Why have you come to Kolkata?

1333
01:47:06,515 --> 01:47:09,140
I have come to research
in the investigation of a case.

1334
01:47:09,363 --> 01:47:12,495
I knew you would
have come for some work.

1335
01:47:12,687 --> 01:47:17,075
But you believed me
and stayed with me. Really great.

1336
01:47:17,551 --> 01:47:21,149
Nowadays girls are becoming
bolder in our country.

1337
01:47:21,372 --> 01:47:22,599
Thank you.

1338
01:47:25,842 --> 01:47:28,011
Where should I keep this cup?

1339
01:47:28,194 --> 01:47:32,247
Do not give to me. Wash it
and keep it neatly on the shelf.

1340
01:47:32,531 --> 01:47:33,829
Okay.

1341
01:47:35,876 --> 01:47:39,241
I was just joking.
Keep it there. I will wash.

1342
01:47:40,650 --> 01:47:43,072
Suppose I fall in love with her,
I have to do these things.

1343
01:47:44,065 --> 01:47:45,940
Shruthi! What happened?

1344
01:47:54,079 --> 01:47:55,599
What happened?

1345
01:47:56,045 --> 01:47:57,990
My leg got stuck to your
underwear and I fell down.

1346
01:47:58,070 --> 01:47:59,815
I do not get it when I want!

1347
01:47:59,895 --> 01:48:04,134
It happens like this if you
stuck the clothes wherever you want.

1348
01:48:04,214 --> 01:48:05,624
Where did my specs fall?

1349
01:48:15,191 --> 01:48:17,137
I fell on the specs and...

1350
01:48:23,295 --> 01:48:25,312
What happened to the specs?

1351
01:48:26,772 --> 01:48:28,201
It is here.

1352
01:48:42,339 --> 01:48:43,718
Thank you.

1353
01:48:51,237 --> 01:48:52,910
What happened?

1354
01:49:09,967 --> 01:49:12,461
Why have you become silent suddenly?

1355
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:16,585
I am also a kind of disabled.

1356
01:49:16,748 --> 01:49:18,724
I cannot see anything without specs.

1357
01:49:19,453 --> 01:49:23,649
Forget about me. God has
created so many handicapped persons.

1358
01:49:24,054 --> 01:49:26,365
Their life must be so hard.

1359
01:49:27,004 --> 01:49:31,301
I thought of helping such
persons after reading your article.

1360
01:49:32,871 --> 01:49:35,547
I felt you have a noble heart.

1361
01:49:35,851 --> 01:49:38,973
I wrote something
to fill up the paper.

1362
01:49:39,053 --> 01:49:40,990
Did you take it so seriously?

1363
01:49:41,193 --> 01:49:45,307
I don't know. But your article
provoked me to help people.

1364
01:49:45,785 --> 01:49:48,369
Do you know how
much funds is allotted

1365
01:49:48,449 --> 01:49:50,315
to handicapped persons.
for a year. in our country?

1366
01:49:51,065 --> 01:49:52,585
9500 million.

1367
01:49:54,369 --> 01:49:56,913
Central Minister Ghaneshyam
Yadav is the owner who manufactures

1368
01:49:56,993 --> 01:49:59,041
the equipments for
the handicapped persons.

1369
01:49:59,315 --> 01:50:02,021
He is running a campaign
called 'Support' in a fake name.

1370
01:50:02,708 --> 01:50:04,634
He supplies only duplicate products.

1371
01:50:05,961 --> 01:50:10,005
There was a boy named Gangadhar.
He was the son of our Office clerk.

1372
01:50:10,775 --> 01:50:12,417
Topper in 10th std.

1373
01:50:13,269 --> 01:50:14,809
He was also handicapped.

1374
01:50:15,883 --> 01:50:18,619
The Government gave
him a new tricycle.

1375
01:50:22,481 --> 01:50:24,609
'Be careful.
- Is the cycle good?'

1376
01:50:34,936 --> 01:50:36,446
'Father!'

1377
01:50:36,681 --> 01:50:37,865
'Cycle!'

1378
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:41,620
'My son!
- Please hold cycle father.'

1379
01:50:59,060 --> 01:51:02,416
He died because of accident
on the day he got it.

1380
01:51:04,712 --> 01:51:07,760
Instead of giving duplicate product,
they need not have given at all.

1381
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:09,755
He would have been alive today.

1382
01:51:11,401 --> 01:51:15,211
Our senior lawyer Prabhakar
decided to handle that case.

1383
01:51:20,570 --> 01:51:23,076
'Please calm down.
Shruthi!'

1384
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:26,780
'Collect each and every detail
of the duplicate parts of the cycle.'

1385
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:28,159
'Do not leave out anything.'

1386
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:29,900
'I am not bothered about
how influential that person is.'

1387
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:30,990
'I will handle it.'

1388
01:51:31,070 --> 01:51:33,072
'We should not lose this case.'

1389
01:51:33,259 --> 01:51:34,873
'Okay?
- Okay Sir.'

1390
01:51:34,953 --> 01:51:37,313
I collected the
defects in the cycle.

1391
01:51:37,505 --> 01:51:38,648
Then?

1392
01:51:38,973 --> 01:51:41,056
That's all.
That case was not solved at all.

1393
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:43,595
But why?
- My senior Lawyer Prabhakar Reddy

1394
01:51:43,675 --> 01:51:45,379
became partner to Ghanashyam Yadav.

1395
01:51:52,854 --> 01:51:56,381
A solitary case of Gangadhar
will not be taken seriously.

1396
01:51:57,030 --> 01:51:59,130
Our media will not consider
it to be a serious one.

1397
01:52:00,339 --> 01:52:03,663
I told Avinash,
your editor in Bangalore branch

1398
01:52:03,817 --> 01:52:07,457
that we will publish such articles
and create public awareness.

1399
01:52:07,537 --> 01:52:09,947
I called him many times.
I requested him.

1400
01:52:11,122 --> 01:52:12,549
He also did not show any interest.

1401
01:52:13,432 --> 01:52:16,870
So I am researching such
cases throughout the country.

1402
01:52:19,279 --> 01:52:20,366
One minute.

1403
01:52:25,036 --> 01:52:26,746
'She is so beautiful!'

1404
01:52:28,734 --> 01:52:33,217
'Her character and intention
is also equally beautiful.'

1405
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:37,086
'She may not be able
to see without specs.'

1406
01:52:37,166 --> 01:52:39,640
'Never mind. I will be her
eyes throughout her life.'

1407
01:52:47,262 --> 01:52:48,661
Now I need your help.

1408
01:52:48,887 --> 01:52:50,752
I have got contact from where
I can collect many such incidents

1409
01:52:50,832 --> 01:52:52,342
which took place in Kolkata.

1410
01:52:52,714 --> 01:52:55,658
You should take me.
- Sure. I will surely take you.

1411
01:52:55,974 --> 01:52:58,422
Then take me to Kalimata
temple tomorrow.

1412
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:02,720
Let us start after taking
the blessings of Kalimata.

1413
01:53:03,166 --> 01:53:05,809
Okay. We will go to Kali temple.

1414
01:53:13,844 --> 01:53:16,131
Why are you putting nail?
Which God's photo is that?

1415
01:53:16,318 --> 01:53:17,786
Come and see.

1416
01:53:20,007 --> 01:53:22,764
It is not God's photo.
It is your article.

1417
01:53:23,575 --> 01:53:25,569
Yes. We met because of this article.

1418
01:53:25,716 --> 01:53:28,983
For me, This is God.

1419
01:53:30,330 --> 01:53:34,189
You sleep inside, on the bed.
I will sleep on the sofa.

1420
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:37,619
But you told the other
way in the morning.

1421
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:41,713
I changed my mind.

1422
01:53:43,789 --> 01:53:45,581
So I am changing the place.

1423
01:53:46,237 --> 01:53:49,237
You sleep inside comfortably.
I will sleep on sofa. Good night.

1424
01:54:30,499 --> 01:54:32,101
Why didn't you come in?

1425
01:54:32,415 --> 01:54:33,925
Don't you have belief in God?

1426
01:54:34,005 --> 01:54:38,490
I believe more on
people and relations.

1427
01:54:38,847 --> 01:54:40,640
If we think good for everyone

1428
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:42,107
it will be beneficial
for people around us.

1429
01:54:42,187 --> 01:54:43,251
That is God.

1430
01:54:43,331 --> 01:54:46,680
If we have negative feelings, things
around us will also be negative.

1431
01:54:46,851 --> 01:54:48,927
That is devil.
- Wow! Nice.

1432
01:54:49,007 --> 01:54:54,505
You want to get justice
to handicapped people.

1433
01:54:54,854 --> 01:54:56,119
What a good thought!

1434
01:54:56,199 --> 01:54:59,103
For me, you are Kalimata.

1435
01:54:59,654 --> 01:55:00,951
Thank you.

1436
01:55:01,575 --> 01:55:03,157
Devotee! What do you want? Ask.

1437
01:55:03,237 --> 01:55:04,251
Ask.

1438
01:55:05,848 --> 01:55:07,178
Ask.

1439
01:55:07,258 --> 01:55:11,743
'I wish to see your smiling
face throughout my life'.

1440
01:55:14,363 --> 01:55:15,773
Ask.

1441
01:55:16,325 --> 01:55:19,681
'I don't know why
I love you so much'.

1442
01:55:20,095 --> 01:55:22,154
'I think I love you very much'.

1443
01:55:24,327 --> 01:55:25,941
Ask.

1444
01:55:26,476 --> 01:55:29,046
'Yes. I think I am
in love with you.'

1445
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:32,029
Gagan!
- What are you doing?!

1446
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:33,638
I am sorry.

1447
01:58:33,806 --> 01:58:35,379
What the hell?
- It's raining... I didn't realize.

1448
01:58:35,459 --> 01:58:36,781
That is why. Come.

1449
01:58:51,181 --> 01:58:52,633
I love you.

1450
01:58:53,011 --> 01:58:54,055
What does it mean?

1451
01:58:54,135 --> 01:58:56,244
It means I will
pay for tea and come.

1452
01:58:56,634 --> 01:58:57,736
I will pay and come.

1453
01:59:03,671 --> 01:59:07,231
'It means, 'I love you'.'

1454
02:00:24,380 --> 02:00:25,935
Thanks a lot for these days.

1455
02:00:26,015 --> 02:00:27,340
They will remain as good memories.

1456
02:00:27,563 --> 02:00:28,667
You are welcome.

1457
02:00:32,091 --> 02:00:33,729
'Shall I say, 'I love you'?'

1458
02:00:34,337 --> 02:00:35,667
Why are you staring like that?

1459
02:00:36,957 --> 02:00:38,100
Nothing.

1460
02:00:38,416 --> 02:00:41,148
What do you think of love?

1461
02:00:41,359 --> 02:00:44,959
Love is a wonderful feeling.

1462
02:00:45,332 --> 02:00:47,270
The world needs it.

1463
02:00:47,626 --> 02:00:48,777
Even for me.

1464
02:00:48,857 --> 02:00:50,034
You know what...

1465
02:00:50,334 --> 02:00:53,090
The most powerful weapon
in the world is love.

1466
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:57,217
My uncle brought
me up since childhood.

1467
02:00:57,517 --> 02:00:59,966
He brought me up as long as possible

1468
02:01:00,184 --> 02:01:01,806
and then admitted
me in an orphanage.

1469
02:01:01,886 --> 02:01:05,358
He used to go to
Court as false witness.

1470
02:01:06,298 --> 02:01:09,266
He was doing a fraud
thing but he was caught by me

1471
02:01:09,436 --> 02:01:11,244
in Court after I became Lawyer.

1472
02:01:11,324 --> 02:01:13,758
'Instead of asking me
for money to meet your needs,'

1473
02:01:14,074 --> 02:01:17,138
'you have come as
false witness to court.'

1474
02:01:17,301 --> 02:01:19,044
'And this is a half murder case.'

1475
02:01:23,593 --> 02:01:24,655
'Shruti.'

1476
02:01:26,001 --> 02:01:27,298
'What shall I do?'

1477
02:01:28,676 --> 02:01:30,144
'Even I have expenses.'

1478
02:01:31,295 --> 02:01:34,036
'How many times can
I ask you for money?'

1479
02:01:36,014 --> 02:01:37,676
'If you love me,'

1480
02:01:38,309 --> 02:01:41,811
'stop committing such fraud
and tread on a good path.'

1481
02:01:46,604 --> 02:01:49,012
Because of his love for me,
he stopped all that

1482
02:01:49,199 --> 02:01:51,487
and is now working honestly
as Security officer.

1483
02:01:51,567 --> 02:01:53,222
That is the power of love.

1484
02:01:56,020 --> 02:01:59,579
Will you take care of
him if something happens to me?

1485
02:01:59,782 --> 02:02:01,898
What will happen to you?

1486
02:02:04,265 --> 02:02:06,859
Shall we go?
Getting late for flight.

1487
02:02:07,159 --> 02:02:08,229
Okay.

1488
02:02:12,243 --> 02:02:14,149
'I wanted to convey my love to her.'

1489
02:02:14,229 --> 02:02:16,561
'But her uncle's matter
diverted the point.'

1490
02:02:16,966 --> 02:02:19,622
'Could not say in water.
Let me try in car.'

1491
02:02:24,974 --> 02:02:26,596
Mr Gagan!
- Yes.

1492
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:28,532
Why are you so silent?

1493
02:02:29,293 --> 02:02:32,364
Nothing. My respect
towards you is increasing.

1494
02:02:34,664 --> 02:02:37,238
People are selfish.

1495
02:02:37,481 --> 02:02:40,745
But you are working hard
for the betterment of a few people.

1496
02:02:41,262 --> 02:02:43,147
You are a brave girl.

1497
02:02:43,704 --> 02:02:47,039
I feel scared to
convey a matter to you.

1498
02:02:49,704 --> 02:02:52,063
Touch one of the fingers.

1499
02:02:53,636 --> 02:02:57,203
This.
- It means I should not tell.

1500
02:02:57,374 --> 02:02:58,615
Then this.

1501
02:02:58,695 --> 02:03:00,001
Why did you touch this?

1502
02:03:00,334 --> 02:03:02,012
This means you should
not ask anything.

1503
02:03:02,092 --> 02:03:03,812
Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1504
02:03:03,892 --> 02:03:05,215
You are crazy.

1505
02:03:24,858 --> 02:03:25,888
Bye.

1506
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:27,186
Bye.

1507
02:03:29,051 --> 02:03:30,129
Sorry.

1508
02:03:53,888 --> 02:03:54,942
See you.

1509
02:04:05,297 --> 02:04:06,926
'I think I am already late.'

1510
02:04:07,006 --> 02:04:08,288
'Shall I express my love?'

1511
02:04:08,548 --> 02:04:09,569
'Shall I say?'

1512
02:04:09,796 --> 02:04:11,540
'Say.'

1513
02:04:11,620 --> 02:04:14,280
Shruthi! One minute.

1514
02:04:17,386 --> 02:04:18,513
That...

1515
02:04:18,829 --> 02:04:20,110
'Say.'

1516
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:22,267
'Say.'

1517
02:04:23,580 --> 02:04:24,780
I really love you.

1518
02:04:34,753 --> 02:04:38,256
You have also turned
out to be like other boys.

1519
02:04:38,791 --> 02:04:40,064
I didn't expect this from you.

1520
02:04:42,878 --> 02:04:43,948
Please...

1521
02:04:44,524 --> 02:04:48,083
Do not take any hasty decision.
There is lot of pollution on earth.

1522
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:52,007
You are going by flight.
You will be amidst the clouds.

1523
02:04:52,534 --> 02:04:55,688
Think about me there. Fresh.

1524
02:04:56,321 --> 02:05:00,107
Take a good decision
after landing and call me.

1525
02:05:01,720 --> 02:05:03,431
I will be waiting for your call.

1526
02:05:05,597 --> 02:05:09,659
I don't know why I am scared
to see you after I proposed to you.

1527
02:05:10,825 --> 02:05:14,523
Even boys feel shy.

1528
02:05:15,017 --> 02:05:16,623
Still I will be
waiting for your phone.

1529
02:05:29,329 --> 02:05:30,529
That was the last meeting.

1530
02:05:30,780 --> 02:05:32,461
The phone which was
switched off on that day has

1531
02:05:32,541 --> 02:05:33,675
not switched on till today.

1532
02:05:34,753 --> 02:05:38,134
She had no accounts
in any of the social medias.

1533
02:05:38,937 --> 02:05:43,826
I thought she is avoiding
me because she doesn't like me.

1534
02:05:44,628 --> 02:05:46,917
I didn't know her
whereabouts since 2 months.

1535
02:05:47,274 --> 02:05:48,710
So I came here to search for her.

1536
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:50,801
I thought at least
we could be friends.

1537
02:05:51,677 --> 02:05:54,588
Shruthi is not a girl
who will commit suicide.

1538
02:05:54,668 --> 02:05:57,271
I feel they are telling the truth.

1539
02:05:57,441 --> 02:06:00,012
Otherwise why will
you come to the same house?

1540
02:06:00,450 --> 02:06:02,055
Why did that sacred thread get lost?

1541
02:06:02,639 --> 02:06:05,299
Shruthi's spirit is on your
body and such things are happening.

1542
02:06:07,325 --> 02:06:09,628
I feel what these people
are saying is correct.

1543
02:06:10,285 --> 02:06:11,607
Sir, Did you hear?

1544
02:06:12,507 --> 02:06:15,109
Bad luck for you.

1545
02:06:18,532 --> 02:06:21,126
Swami! Did you hear?

1546
02:06:21,766 --> 02:06:27,878
If he is possessed by that
spirit and he starts bashing us,

1547
02:06:27,958 --> 02:06:30,893
we will surely die.

1548
02:06:32,094 --> 02:06:35,296
Somehow save us.

1549
02:06:36,772 --> 02:06:39,236
The spirit in him should
be removed today itself.

1550
02:06:39,892 --> 02:06:41,838
Bring it out.

1551
02:06:43,104 --> 02:06:45,585
Full media is behind him.

1552
02:06:46,234 --> 02:06:49,890
They are arguing if
he has gone mad or not.

1553
02:06:51,204 --> 02:06:53,604
They are covering every movement.

1554
02:06:56,036 --> 02:06:57,439
How?

1555
02:06:57,707 --> 02:07:02,207
He has given the reason
of mental illness to get bail.

1556
02:07:02,418 --> 02:07:07,583
So we can easily
bring him to your place

1557
02:07:08,150 --> 02:07:10,226
on the pretext of
shifting him to NIMHANS.

1558
02:07:11,368 --> 02:07:15,414
Ashram. I will perform Smashanakali
Homa.(religious ritual)

1559
02:07:15,849 --> 02:07:19,125
I will bring him from
his house immediately.

1560
02:07:19,205 --> 02:07:21,356
Excuse Me! Mr Gagan!

1561
02:07:22,231 --> 02:07:24,878
We have received orders from
Court to shift you to NIMHANS.

1562
02:07:24,958 --> 02:07:26,097
Please cooperate.

1563
02:07:33,413 --> 02:07:35,237
What is happening?

1564
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:37,913
This is not a legal matter.

1565
02:07:37,993 --> 02:07:40,131
He is possessed by spirit.

1566
02:07:40,935 --> 02:07:42,745
Why are you taking him to hospital?

1567
02:07:42,825 --> 02:07:44,173
Listen to me.

1568
02:07:44,253 --> 02:07:46,267
What is the use of
taking him to NIMHANS?

1569
02:07:46,347 --> 02:07:49,108
A person calling himself
Shruthi's uncle is

1570
02:07:49,394 --> 02:07:51,366
creating ruckus
in front of the media.

1571
02:07:51,619 --> 02:07:53,675
I will send him there.

1572
02:07:53,755 --> 02:07:57,236
You should know the
secret behind her death.

1573
02:07:57,316 --> 02:07:59,370
Shruthi! Please do not go.

1574
02:08:17,071 --> 02:08:19,302
The ambulance carrying Gagan is

1575
02:08:19,382 --> 02:08:21,941
going towards another
side instead of NIMHANS.

1576
02:08:22,021 --> 02:08:23,687
Something is very fishy.

1577
02:08:23,767 --> 02:08:24,809
I will send the media there.

1578
02:08:24,889 --> 02:08:26,878
Okay Sir.
I will inform the Lawyer.

What is happening here?

1585
02:11:00,199 --> 02:11:01,473
Yes, Appaji.

1586
02:11:02,746 --> 02:11:04,725
I have made all these arrangements.

1587
02:11:04,992 --> 02:11:06,022
How is it?

1588
02:11:06,654 --> 02:11:08,632
I made a mistake by hitting you.

1589
02:11:09,167 --> 02:11:10,829
But it was not intentional.

1590
02:11:10,991 --> 02:11:13,432
I know.

1591
02:11:13,991 --> 02:11:16,440
We have no enmity.

1592
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:20,761
But your lover Shruthi's
spirit is inside you.

1593
02:11:20,841 --> 02:11:22,544
I have enmity towards her.

1594
02:11:26,063 --> 02:11:29,574
Does it mean that Shruthi
did not commit suicide?!

1595
02:11:29,654 --> 02:11:31,982
It was a murder. We killed her.

1596
02:11:34,869 --> 02:11:37,334
Are you angry?

1597
02:11:37,740 --> 02:11:40,627
Shruthi was your lover.
It is natural for you to get angry.

1598
02:11:40,789 --> 02:11:42,605
You will be pained. It is natural.

1599
02:11:42,784 --> 02:11:45,035
We advised her to
follow our lifestyle.

1600
02:11:45,115 --> 02:11:49,073
But she refused.
She said our lifestyle is wrong.

1601
02:11:49,153 --> 02:11:51,082
Then how can we lead our life?

1602
02:11:51,162 --> 02:11:53,565
That is why we killed her.

1603
02:11:54,670 --> 02:11:56,363
You don't worry.

1604
02:11:56,557 --> 02:11:59,898
We will drive out the
spirit which has possessed you.

1605
02:12:00,272 --> 02:12:03,426
Shruthi is not the type
of girl who will trouble others.

1606
02:12:04,504 --> 02:12:06,920
But if someone troubles her...

1607
02:12:15,377 --> 02:12:20,059
Guru! It is she.
She has come!

1608
02:12:20,231 --> 02:12:21,751
Guru!

1609
02:12:25,918 --> 02:12:27,418
Wait.

1610
02:12:30,164 --> 02:12:32,008
Let us wait and watch.

1611
02:12:38,567 --> 02:12:40,766
Do not get scared.

1612
02:13:09,588 --> 02:13:11,019
Don't worry.

1613
02:13:23,128 --> 02:13:24,577
What is this!

1614
02:13:47,919 --> 02:13:49,511
[sanksrit chants]

1615
02:15:05,372 --> 02:15:11,766
[sanksrit chants continue]

1616
02:16:54,862 --> 02:17:00,677
[sanksrit chants continue]

1617
02:18:03,788 --> 02:18:08,871
Shruthi! No! Go away.

1618
02:18:11,428 --> 02:18:14,701
I will kill your uncle.
- No, Shruthi.

1619
02:18:14,781 --> 02:18:16,434
Go away.
- Do not come.

1620
02:18:16,514 --> 02:18:19,009
Do not come near.
No!

1621
02:18:19,089 --> 02:18:21,940
I am your uncle. Please go away.

1622
02:18:24,562 --> 02:18:26,230
Do not come.
- I will kill him.

1623
02:18:26,310 --> 02:18:27,941
Do not come near. Go.

1624
02:18:30,509 --> 02:18:32,810
Do not come near. I will kill him.

1625
02:18:33,734 --> 02:18:37,463
[sanksrit chants continue]

1626
02:18:49,797 --> 02:18:51,946
Sir! Reporter Gagan Dikshit is here.

1627
02:18:52,026 --> 02:18:53,547
Media is already here.

1628
02:18:53,740 --> 02:18:56,304
Some ritual is going on here.

1629
02:18:56,384 --> 02:18:58,361
Minister is dead.

1630
02:18:58,441 --> 02:19:00,459
Along with him many people are dead.

1631
02:19:00,539 --> 02:19:03,277
Situation is very critical.
Please send medical emergency.

1632
02:19:10,708 --> 02:19:16,849
I am surprised that educated persons
like them believe in Soul, spirit,

1633
02:19:17,042 --> 02:19:20,316
ghosts etc in this age when
science and technology is developed.

1634
02:19:20,396 --> 02:19:23,174
Your Honor!
It is a serious case of MPD.

1635
02:19:23,254 --> 02:19:24,836
Multiple Personality Disorder.

1636
02:19:24,916 --> 02:19:26,863
He needs treatment. That's all.

1637
02:19:28,374 --> 02:19:34,516
There is no value for Ghosts,
spirits and souls in Law.

1638
02:19:34,729 --> 02:19:39,635
But you take oath
in the name of God!

1639
02:19:39,715 --> 02:19:43,851
I saw that spirit.

1640
02:19:44,044 --> 02:19:48,848
I know how cruel and violent it is.

1641
02:19:50,521 --> 02:19:54,382
But Court will not accept this.

1642
02:19:54,462 --> 02:19:55,994
You have to believe.

1643
02:19:56,419 --> 02:19:59,196
Gagan is not aware of the deaths.

1644
02:20:00,342 --> 02:20:02,277
This is the work of spirit.

1645
02:20:03,392 --> 02:20:07,193
This is the truth.
You all have to believe this.

1646
02:20:09,898 --> 02:20:11,854
I am telling this.

1647
02:20:12,300 --> 02:20:15,158
Do you have anything
to say about this?

1648
02:20:17,722 --> 02:20:20,336
Shruthi is not the type
of girl who will commit suicide.

1649
02:20:20,670 --> 02:20:23,559
Judiciary follows Law and doesn't
debate about the presence of spirit.

1650
02:20:23,833 --> 02:20:28,393
Though there were
people who witnessed it

1651
02:20:28,473 --> 02:20:32,812
and Swamiji was present there,
it is not possible to believe it.

1652
02:20:33,025 --> 02:20:37,849
So according to IPC Section 84,
this Court dismisses this case

1653
02:20:38,061 --> 02:20:40,986
and orders that Gagan must be given

1654
02:20:41,066 --> 02:20:44,964
suitable treatment in
a mental hospital.

1655
02:20:57,793 --> 02:21:00,905
Do not come near. I will kill you.

1656
02:21:12,327 --> 02:21:14,861
No! I beg of you!

1657
02:21:18,438 --> 02:21:21,266
No. I made a mistake.

1658
02:21:21,346 --> 02:21:24,509
Please do not kill me.

1659
02:21:25,482 --> 02:21:28,401
No!

1660
02:21:49,558 --> 02:21:51,336
Go away!

1661
02:22:02,392 --> 02:22:05,369
O God! Release the soul!

1662
02:22:13,059 --> 02:22:18,443
Which God?
Which Shruthi? Which Devil or Ghost?

1663
02:22:19,457 --> 02:22:22,257
All these were
illusions created by me.

1664
02:22:22,954 --> 02:22:26,565
You are the last
character in my drama.

1665
02:22:28,365 --> 02:22:32,001
Does it mean you are
not possessed by spirit?

1666
02:22:32,368 --> 02:22:36,093
I wanted to take revenge
on Shruthi's death.

1667
02:22:36,676 --> 02:22:38,386
I am not possessed.

1668
02:22:40,121 --> 02:22:46,038
I saw Shruthi dying in
the hands of these devils.

1669
02:22:46,988 --> 02:22:48,052
'Reached home.

1670
02:22:48,132 --> 02:22:50,612
Without you,
this house looks vacant.

1671
02:22:50,815 --> 02:22:54,654
Missing you.
- See. He is my uncle.

1672
02:22:55,389 --> 02:22:58,240
One minute. Hi Uncle!
- Shruthi! Have you come?

1673
02:22:58,320 --> 02:22:59,669
Looks like you are
preparing something special!

1674
02:22:59,749 --> 02:23:01,553
Your favorite dish.

1675
02:23:01,633 --> 02:23:04,382
Superb!
- Eat.

1676
02:23:04,462 --> 02:23:05,631
Thank you.

1677
02:23:06,563 --> 02:23:08,537
I will get one litre milk.

1678
02:23:08,617 --> 02:23:09,693
Okay.
- Will come now.

1679
02:23:09,773 --> 02:23:11,622
I will lock the door and go.
- Okay.

1680
02:23:12,562 --> 02:23:13,657
You know what?

1681
02:23:13,737 --> 02:23:16,527
You should taste the
sweets prepared by my uncle.

1682
02:23:17,775 --> 02:23:20,443
Let us keep your uncle
as our cook after our marriage.

1683
02:23:20,775 --> 02:23:22,462
What did you say?!

1684
02:23:22,542 --> 02:23:24,157
I was just joking.

1685
02:23:24,498 --> 02:23:26,565
Give me some sweet news soon.

1686
02:23:27,060 --> 02:23:28,170
What is it?

1687
02:23:28,250 --> 02:23:30,798
There was a love
story in the airport!

1688
02:23:30,878 --> 02:23:32,289
The same matter.

1689
02:23:32,515 --> 02:23:34,340
One minute. Someone has come.

1690
02:23:34,420 --> 02:23:35,572
No problem.

1691
02:23:39,966 --> 02:23:41,279
Sir!

1692
02:23:43,638 --> 02:23:44,927
Shruthi!

1693
02:23:45,632 --> 02:23:46,823
Shruthi!

1694
02:24:05,456 --> 02:24:07,486
You are so arrogant!

1695
02:24:11,772 --> 02:24:14,893
Shruthi! Where is your uncle?

1696
02:24:14,973 --> 02:24:16,596
Shruthi!

1697
02:24:17,107 --> 02:24:19,126
You cannot see properly.

1698
02:24:19,206 --> 02:24:21,964
Do you want to put us in jail?

1699
02:24:35,877 --> 02:24:40,167
Where are the documents
which you collected?

1700
02:24:41,245 --> 02:24:42,826
Give them.

1701
02:24:42,981 --> 02:24:44,894
Give.

1702
02:24:48,747 --> 02:24:50,428
Shruthi!
- Mother!

1703
02:24:50,508 --> 02:24:55,068
Shruthi! Where is your uncle?

1704
02:24:55,285 --> 02:25:01,822
Prabhu! If she is dead,
who will submit the evidence?

1705
02:25:09,515 --> 02:25:11,532
Shruthi!

1706
02:25:12,028 --> 02:25:14,542
Alas! Leave her.
What are you doing?

1707
02:25:14,622 --> 02:25:16,244
Are you a human?

1708
02:25:16,324 --> 02:25:18,494
You are acting like a demon.

1709
02:25:21,019 --> 02:25:24,090
I have already mixed poison
with the sweet and given to her.

1710
02:25:30,120 --> 02:25:31,802
Was this necessary?

1711
02:25:34,184 --> 02:25:35,795
I am sorry.

1712
02:25:36,242 --> 02:25:39,211
I needed money urgently.
- Why uncle?

1713
02:25:39,394 --> 02:25:40,944
I had no other way.
So I did like this.

1714
02:25:41,024 --> 02:25:43,499
What was my mistake?
- I am sorry.

1715
02:25:44,705 --> 02:25:47,441
I am sorry. Forget it.
- Uncle!

1716
02:25:47,927 --> 02:25:50,562
Uncle!
- Hey!

1717
02:25:50,866 --> 02:25:53,187
Received money in my account.
Thank you.

1718
02:25:53,491 --> 02:25:55,154
Do whatever you want.'

1719
02:26:13,122 --> 02:26:15,869
One person is a Central Minister.
Another one is a Lawyer.

1720
02:26:15,949 --> 02:26:20,025
I knew I will not get justice
because they have power.

1721
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:24,809
That is why I created this illusion.

1722
02:26:25,134 --> 02:26:28,367
People who believe in God
said I was possessed by spirit.

1723
02:26:28,803 --> 02:26:32,219
Those who believe in Science called
me a person with Split personality.

1724
02:26:32,969 --> 02:26:34,388
People may think whatever they want.

1725
02:26:34,554 --> 02:26:37,155
But according to Law I am innocent.

1726
02:26:39,051 --> 02:26:41,899
I have mental illness.

1727
02:26:42,597 --> 02:26:44,971
According to IPC Section 84,

1728
02:26:46,028 --> 02:26:49,803
there is no punishment for any crime
done because of mental illness.

1729
02:26:50,672 --> 02:26:53,105
This society will believe

1730
02:26:53,876 --> 02:26:57,762
that I have been possessed
only if persons like you say.

1731
02:26:59,688 --> 02:27:02,561
Whether I was possessed
by spirit or I was mad...

1732
02:27:03,281 --> 02:27:04,637
Nobody should get an

1733
02:27:07,602 --> 02:27:09,976
answer to it at any time.

1734
02:27:13,172 --> 02:27:15,190
Get up. Press is here.

1735
02:27:16,987 --> 02:27:18,115
What shall I say?

1736
02:27:18,195 --> 02:27:20,404
Get up. Chant mantra.

1737
02:27:20,484 --> 02:27:23,012
What shall I say?
- Throw turmeric.

1738
02:27:23,092 --> 02:27:24,224
Throw.

1739
02:27:25,164 --> 02:27:29,757

Rolling Start...

1741
02:28:03,139 --> 02:28:04,744
Rolling.
- Camera.

1742
02:28:05,085 --> 02:28:06,626
Rolling.
- Action.

1743
02:28:13,954 --> 02:28:15,551
Switch off.

Who is showing light?
