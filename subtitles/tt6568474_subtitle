1
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:26,442
Horse race... The only betting game
running in India with a license...

2
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:29,358
It is business for some
and addiction for another.

3
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:33,317
It also has victory, defeat,
cheating and betrayal.

4
00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:34,952
There's kick in a running horse

5
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,700
but it also has the risk of destroying
many lives falling behind it.

6
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:41,001
This story is the
determination of a guy

7
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:45,275
who tries to unite such tired
lives and broken relations.

8
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:05,025
Sir, good morning.

9
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:06,400
Good morning.

10
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:08,275
How much are they betting on our horse?

11
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:09,937
25 crores sir..
- Good.

12
00:02:10,317 --> 00:02:12,360
On K.R's horse...?
- Just 15 crores.

13
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:14,067
What's the risk?
- Absolute zero.

14
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:17,233
Sir, our jockey
is the winner of 14 major titles.

15
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:20,233
They would bet on K.R's horse
if they thought it would win.

16
00:02:20,317 --> 00:02:21,692
They wouldn't bet on ours, would they?

17
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:24,317
So, K.R sir, looser sir...

18
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:28,692
That's our horse...
- I know that... K.R is beside you.

19
00:02:36,483 --> 00:02:37,900
Horse no. 5 is ours baby...

20
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:46,831
Come on...
- Yes!

21
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:50,237
Come on...
- Come on...

22
00:02:52,192 --> 00:02:53,650
Come on...
- Come on...

23
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,650
Come on...

24
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:12,735
What is it Dharmendra?

25
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:17,185
You lost the race in spite of
having all those statistics.

26
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:18,558
Simple...

27
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:21,733
You saw the horse and jockey details.

28
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,233
I saw his family details.

29
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:26,817
Poor guy, he is very emotional
to his family.

30
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:31,150
Passion makes a coward win and with emotion
we can defeat strong opponent.

31
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:35,525
With so much experience,
how could you miss such a small logic?

32
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:41,900
We've been losing far more races
than we've won for the past 10 years.

33
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:44,567
Our company had lost 300 crores until now.

34
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:47,858
We would have to shut our company down
if this continues.

35
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:49,608
I need some time.

36
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:50,994
How much time do you need, Sir?

37
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,585
We feel ashamed looking at
the K.R Company's victories.

38
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,400
You only have two options now.

39
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:57,535
One is to resign from
the Chairman's position

40
00:03:57,843 --> 00:03:59,957
and the second is to
get your son back.

41
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:02,608
You have only two days' time.
Decide for yourself.

42
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:07,525
What are you thinking about?
Only your son can get you out of this.

43
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,858
Do you think he will agree?
- Do you have another option?

44
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:13,269
Go and get your son.

45
00:04:14,152 --> 00:04:16,740
Dad... Ride faster...
- We are already going fast.

46
00:04:24,318 --> 00:04:25,290
Hey!

47
00:04:27,315 --> 00:04:29,192
Dear, what is that?

48
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,400
It's wrong to do so.
Do not repeat.

49
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:50,608
Hi.
- Dad.

50
00:04:56,246 --> 00:04:58,545
Thank you, Dad.
- Come on, hug me.

51
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,340
Dad... Candy floss...

52
00:05:07,402 --> 00:05:09,394
Give me candy floss.
- Yes.

53
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,192
Done.

54
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,768
Why are you eating so slowly?
- It will be finished if I eat, Dad.

55
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:23,163
I will get you another one.

56
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:26,243
Dad, the teacher hit me.

57
00:05:26,802 --> 00:05:29,608
Did you understand the lesson?
Open the notebooks everyone.

58
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:30,895
Why did you hit my son?

59
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,748
He wasn't completing his
homework since a week.

60
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:33,862
So I hit him.

61
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:35,942
If he does a mistake, don't hit him.
- Why?

62
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:39,275
I am raising him.
His mistake is my mistake.

63
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,528
I can't bear it
if he's hurt.

64
00:05:53,572 --> 00:05:56,043
It wouldn't be nice
if you repeat this.

65
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:57,900
What do you think of yourself?

66
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,181
How dare you hit my son!

67
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:02,919
I gave the teacher a
serious warning, dear.

68
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:04,403
He won't mess with you again.

69
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:17,567
Dad, I will never leave my
homework incomplete again.

70
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:22,640
This is Dad's...

71
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:26,192
This is Mom's...

72
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:30,400
Dad, it would be so nice
if mom were with us.

73
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:33,192
She would have fed me then.

74
00:06:34,404 --> 00:06:35,900
Who told you mom isn't here?

75
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:39,067
You see those stars there?
She watches us along with them.

76
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:40,900
Here...

77
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,650
While buying a horse,
I check whether it is of a breed or not.

78
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:03,483
You got some casteless girl
and say she is my daughter-in-law?

79
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:04,817
How did you think I would agree to it?

80
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,692
I didn't marry her
so that you would accept...

81
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,650
I married her because I love her.

82
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:10,192
What is that love?

83
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:11,650
He is my business partner.

84
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:14,275
I gave him my word
that you would marry his daughter...

85
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:15,942
I gave her my word too...

86
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:17,817
That I would share my life with her.

87
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:19,817
She came here trusting me.

88
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,442
She didn't trust you...
She trusts your money!

89
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,983
Remember one thing dad...

90
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:27,400
The education you gave, the horse riding
you taught me and the money...

91
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:29,192
There is another
thing above all this.

92
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,608
Life.
That is enough for us.

93
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:33,150
Let's go Lakshmi...

94
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:36,900
I rejected your love in anger
because you said no to me.

95
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,983
I thought I punished you,
but why am I going through this punishment?

96
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:43,400
I am alone since six years.

97
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:46,858
Please forgive me and come home.

98
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:48,733
I beg you...

99
00:07:48,858 --> 00:07:49,923
Father...

100
00:07:50,942 --> 00:07:53,150
It is wrong to let go relation
being rigid.

101
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,275
But it's not wrong
to let go rigidness for relation.

102
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:57,856
We will come.

103
00:08:00,775 --> 00:08:04,108
This is your room
You should be here from today.

104
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:08,400
You both
are like my two eyes.

105
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,448
From now, my son should become busy.
Till he gets out of his son's reach.

106
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,957
Her photograph and the son
shouldn't be in his life...

107
00:08:38,295 --> 00:08:41,858
Grandpa... Where is my Dad?
I'm getting late for school.

108
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,483
Your dad isn't here.
He went to the Estate farm.

109
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:46,567
From today,
he asked you to go to school by yourself.

110
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:48,900
Is it?

111
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:55,108
Dad... where is Siddhu?
I have to drop him at school.

112
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:57,192
He wants to go
with his friends from today.

113
00:08:57,483 --> 00:08:59,733
He went in the bus.

114
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:02,314
Ok.

115
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:07,025
I'll eat if my dad feeds me.

116
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,733
Your dad is not coming. Eat.

117
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:10,275
I won't eat.

118
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:13,067
Father, what is Siddhu doing?

119
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:14,817
Just had his food...
About to sleep.

120
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:17,067
He wouldn't eat until I feed him.

121
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:20,983
I fed with him my own hands..

122
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:22,067
All right father.

123
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:32,105
I think we are done with the meeting.

124
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:37,150
Grandpa, I got the first rank.
I have to show dad my progress card.

125
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:41,900
Dad is busy with a business meeting.
Give it here.

126
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:45,358
Go and freshen up
- Ok.

127
00:09:50,942 --> 00:09:51,942
Father...

128
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:02,045
Your dad tore it apart.
- Did my dad do that?

129
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:09,983
Where are you going?
- To my dad.

130
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:17,715
Your dad has changed
a lot lately.

131
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,693
He doesn't care
about you anymore.

132
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:25,150
Do you see a girl next to him?
He is going to marry her.

133
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,113
From the moment he is married

134
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,528
he will throw away your
mother's photo in a dust bin.

135
00:10:29,984 --> 00:10:31,775
He will throw you
from the house.

136
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:34,275
You dad has changed a lot.

137
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,733
Why did you hit me?
- My wish! I will hit.

138
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:49,067
What will you do?
- Shut up!

139
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,483
I hate you, Father...
- Get lost!

140
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,317
He is just a small kid...

141
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:59,608
Father, he is getting
naughty these days.

142
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:05,989
Siddhu.

143
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:07,421
Siddhu.

144
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:12,598
Siddharth.

145
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:14,296
Siddharth.

146
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,911
Siddhu.
Father...

147
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:18,108
What happened?
- Where is Siddhu?

148
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,775
Sir... Sir...

149
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:22,608
Siddharth ran away.

150
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,234
'Few years later.'

151
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:03,922
Oh, no! Please stop...
Sir... Stop...

152
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:31,882
The pitch is great.

153
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:34,317
Anasuya said we would organize horse races.

154
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:38,900
As it will be difficult in the city,
I planned it in the outskirts.

155
00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:42,525
Yes... you will do anything for Anasuya,
wouldn't you?

156
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:44,358
Anasuya...

157
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:53,025
What are we waiting for?

158
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:55,275
Let's begin the betting. Let's get started

159
00:12:55,358 --> 00:13:00,067
Today's first race is between
the white horse and the black horse.

160
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:05,692
The one to get the red towel
on the doll back here

161
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:08,400
is the winner of the race.

162
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:14,108
White horse is Anasuya's.
5 lakhs...

163
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:16,150
5 lakhs on the black horse...

164
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:18,442
Come on, baby...

165
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:19,641
Bet on that horse.

166
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,067
What is this?
What's going on here?

167
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:26,775
Horse racing...
- It's called "Gurrapu Pandalu" in Telugu.

168
00:13:28,662 --> 00:13:30,067
What is this?

169
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:32,942
Our entire crop is destroyed
with your cars.

170
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:36,817
Only the crop is lost. Why does
he weep as if he lost his life?

171
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:41,025
Who is he? - Oh...
He is farmer. Agriculture...

172
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:45,191
Agriculture? - I live on this.
Don't snatch it from me.

173
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:49,150
Hey, old man. Bet your 5 acres
on Anasuya's horse.

174
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:53,692
It will be doubled. What
will you earn on Agriculture?

175
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:56,775
It won't be nice if you don't leave now.
Vacate this place right now.

176
00:13:56,825 --> 00:13:57,871
What do you mean?

177
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:01,483
What happened? Get up.

178
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:04,150
What happened?

179
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:06,598
They destroyed my entire crop.

180
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:08,846
When I questioned,
they hit and pushed me away.

181
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,546
They are all rich arrogant kids.

182
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:13,127
We cannot do anything
going against them.

183
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:15,900
Does that mean I lost my crop?

184
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:18,108
Is there no one who
can do justice to me?

185
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:19,650
There is one person.

186
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,192
Who is it?

187
00:14:23,483 --> 00:14:26,067
Everyone run away when a
tiger comes onto the village.

188
00:14:26,192 --> 00:14:28,358
But one person will
come in its way.

189
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,400
Because he doesn't
know what fear is...

190
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:39,858
The word horse itself
gives him chills.

191
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,483
He is not even 25 years old...

192
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:48,858
But can finish 25
people in one go.

193
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:52,108
Is he that powerful?
- It's not some ordinary power.

194
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,608
Mega power.

195
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:40,608
Hey, are all the spoilt kids
from the city present right here?

196
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,150
Who are you?
- Why do you need introduction to get hit?

197
00:15:46,483 --> 00:15:47,483
Hit us?

198
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:52,233
You look like Chiranjeevi.
What have you come here for?

199
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:56,483
Even my actions are like him.

200
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:59,692
You see how rough my hand is.

201
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:02,525
Cool... Cool...

202
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:03,942
Why are you getting so hyper?

203
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:06,025
I need clarity in one thing.

204
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:09,692
Who came here smashing
that old man's crop?

205
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:13,358
It's me. So what?
- Move aside.

206
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:16,608
Who identified this place?
- It's me.

207
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:19,983
So what?
- Move aside.

208
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:22,483
Who wanted to hold horse races here?

209
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:26,983
Wait... you will go and he
will push. I am here for you.

210
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:28,358
Enjoy drink.

211
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:32,650
I am the one who held the horse
races here. What will you do?

212
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:36,150
If you have an empty land, graze
buffalos or a herd of sheep.

213
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:39,567
But who organizes horse races?

214
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:13,900
I came to watch the horse races.

215
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:17,983
But I saw a man
who makes men run like horses.

216
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:32,483
Hey... Farmer is the
backbone to our country.

217
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:35,275
Don't try to break it.

218
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,317
Uncle, keep this.

219
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,192
Son, what can I do for you?

220
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:44,317
Don't say that, uncle.

221
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,983
Hey fool...

222
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:51,150
It's called agriculture.
Learn to pronounce properly.

223
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:53,650
Excuse me
- Yeah?

224
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:57,025
My car is troubling me.

225
00:18:57,608 --> 00:18:59,608
Will you please give me lift?
- Sure. Come...

226
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:11,233
"You are like a rose.
Your eyes are like honey."

227
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:18,442
"I fell for you, baby."

228
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,817
"Come to me."

229
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:27,275
"I am your Anasuya."

230
00:19:58,649 --> 00:20:04,733
"How are you born this way, Anasuya?"

231
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:11,067
"You got a selfie with me, Anasuya."

232
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:14,150
"Hey Angry young man,
I'm your fan."

233
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:17,358
"I will give you the seat beside me,
my dear."

234
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,692
"I packed my glamor for you as a gift."

235
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:25,108
"Don't provoke me this way man."

236
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:31,233
"How are you born this way, Anasuya?"

237
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:37,567
"You got a selfie with me, Anasuya."

238
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:09,858
"You have flexed your muscles so well."

239
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:16,275
"Your curves are giving me silly signals."

240
00:21:18,358 --> 00:21:24,525
"Your features seem similar to me.
Young hearts will faint staring at you."

241
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:30,988
"Your cheeks are samples of beauty.
Shimla apples will get jealous."

242
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:34,192
"Don't provoke me this way man."

243
00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:40,233
"How are you born this way, Anasuya?"

244
00:21:40,543 --> 00:21:46,567
"You got a selfie with me, Anasuya."

245
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:36,983
"You got a selfie with me, Anasuya."

246
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,937
Good morning, Sir...
- Good morning...

247
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:44,899
Good morning, Sir...
- Good morning...

248
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:52,230
Good morning, Sir...
- Good morning...

249
00:22:52,517 --> 00:22:53,972
Good morning, Sir...
- Good morning, Sir...

250
00:22:57,691 --> 00:22:59,983
Padma...
- Sir... Sir... Sir... Sir...

251
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:01,150
What is this, Padma?

252
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:03,275
There's a new look board outside
but the same old people inside.

253
00:23:03,358 --> 00:23:05,816
How can we run bullet with coal?

254
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:06,858
Should have some pick up.

255
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:09,691
I want to dismiss the entire staff urgently.
- Sir, we cannot do anything.

256
00:23:09,774 --> 00:23:11,733
Why? - Sir, they got a bond written
with the Chairman.

257
00:23:11,816 --> 00:23:13,816
They might excel here
but can't be sent outside.

258
00:23:13,941 --> 00:23:16,566
Don't they have an expiry?
- They are not medicines, Sir.

259
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:17,691
They are like alcohol.

260
00:23:17,775 --> 00:23:19,858
They get better with age.
- Better?

261
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,418
Have a look.

262
00:23:22,925 --> 00:23:23,963
Mr. Murthy.

263
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:27,733
What are you doing?
- This computer is affected with insects.

264
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,108
Insects? - He told me
it would go away if I spray 'hit'.

265
00:23:32,025 --> 00:23:35,608
It's not insects or fungus.
It's called virus.

266
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:37,733
Spray that on him. He will die.

267
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:42,233
You please stop giving suggestions.

268
00:23:42,316 --> 00:23:45,858
Hello... Son,
your red shirt is really nice.

269
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:50,400
Give him those Karunanidhi glasses
- Shutter down. Look now.

270
00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:53,150
Oh... It's green. Nice...

271
00:23:54,191 --> 00:23:56,733
Son, he has color blindness.

272
00:23:56,941 --> 00:23:59,066
He doesn't know you are
wearing a white shirt.

273
00:23:59,275 --> 00:24:00,441
Nice... Nice...

274
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,900
What is this, Padma?

275
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:06,131
Let's go sir.

276
00:24:08,816 --> 00:24:09,858
Are you hurt?

277
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,108
Who are you? What's your name?

278
00:24:11,191 --> 00:24:12,194
Hari...

279
00:24:12,733 --> 00:24:14,233
What happened to this city?

280
00:24:14,358 --> 00:24:17,400
A girl has a guy's name
A guy has a girl's name.

281
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:18,983
Hari, Padma...

282
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:20,400
Why are you so excited?

283
00:24:20,566 --> 00:24:23,150
Sir, I found a superb caption
for our sports page.

284
00:24:23,233 --> 00:24:26,150
I also took a rough copy.
Dhoni on the horse of victory...

285
00:24:26,191 --> 00:24:28,566
How is it, Sir?
- Padma... - Sir...

286
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,988
What is this?

287
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:32,782
Horse...

288
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:35,400
Sorry, sir. She is new here.

289
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:37,316
She doesn't know.
It's not a horse, sir.

290
00:24:37,608 --> 00:24:39,191
It is some other animal.
Elephant.

291
00:24:39,358 --> 00:24:41,358
Dhoni on the elephant of victory...
Okay, sir?

292
00:24:41,483 --> 00:24:45,150
Horse is better than elephant
- Shut up.

293
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,525
Don't use, write or spell the words
like horses and races in my paper.

294
00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:49,483
Everything is the same, sir.

295
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:50,733
Did I ask?
- Okay.

296
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:52,858
You tell me the caption.

297
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:57,233
Dhoni is here. The opponents will
now fear. This is called creativity.

298
00:24:57,775 --> 00:25:00,441
Sir,
I don't think we can use that.

299
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,600
You are not following
ethics here.

300
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:03,404
You are destroying the paper.
Did I ask you?

301
00:25:03,496 --> 00:25:04,816
Do as told... go.

302
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:05,858
I will handle it, Sir.

303
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,608
Dear Hari...

304
00:25:07,983 --> 00:25:10,650
Who do you think he is?
He is our creative head.

305
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:13,358
I will do as he says...
You will do as I say...

306
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,025
Okay?
- I am going to smash you.

307
00:25:15,566 --> 00:25:17,025
I want this fire

308
00:25:18,358 --> 00:25:19,441
Padma...
- Sir...

309
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:21,983
Who is this girl? She is really beautiful.
- She is a racer, Sir

310
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,775
She is disgusting.

311
00:25:23,858 --> 00:25:26,816
Sir, she ran 40 kilometers an
hour and won a trophy for India.

312
00:25:26,941 --> 00:25:28,941
Who has she helped?

313
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:31,650
A girl who gets us coffee
every hour is enough for us.

314
00:25:31,691 --> 00:25:33,483
We should keep such
a girl in the office.

315
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:36,066
My brain is heating up
with these old fellows.

316
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,400
There's no color in my life.

317
00:25:37,566 --> 00:25:40,150
Sir, Pammi aunty is throwing
a birthday party in the evening.

318
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:42,858
I will cover the Page 3
there with lot of force.

319
00:25:42,983 --> 00:25:44,358
You cover the girls present there.

320
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:50,983
Hey, what happened? Why are you
keeping your hands in between?

321
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,983
Get the checking done.
Look what I have.

322
00:25:54,691 --> 00:25:57,566
I have what everyone else do.
- Sathi...

323
00:25:58,066 --> 00:26:02,441
What happened?
- Where are you going with the flowers?

324
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:06,400
Wait...
Pammi aunty is celebrating birthday.

325
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:09,400
She invited everyone
We can find nice girls there.

326
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:11,400
I am going, sister.
Hey...

327
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,158
You can't withdraw 2000
and 500 rupee notes at the ATM.

328
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:16,358
He told you to get lost.

329
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:19,150
So what?
Cards are in fashion now.

330
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:22,025
Mr. Modi has done the right thing.
I will swipe the card only.

331
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,941
Mr. Modi will feel bad otherwise.
There's some noise there.

332
00:26:29,358 --> 00:26:30,816
Sir, she is Pammi aunty.

333
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:32,983
Hello, Pammi. Happy birthday.
- Hi, Padma.

334
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:35,983
There should be full coverage in Page 3.
- It will be wonderful.

335
00:26:36,066 --> 00:26:37,983
Who is he? He is hot.

336
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:39,399
Careful. He might poke.

337
00:26:39,483 --> 00:26:41,774
He is our boss.
- Let's celebrate the party now.

338
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:42,911
With dinner.

339
00:26:45,941 --> 00:26:46,858
Hey girl...

340
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:48,816
Which town?
- Kakinada

341
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,316
Kakinada...
- Yes. Yours?

342
00:26:51,441 --> 00:26:52,650
Karimnagar.

343
00:26:52,816 --> 00:26:54,400
Oh...
- What are you drinking?

344
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,941
Screwdriver...

345
00:26:56,025 --> 00:26:57,150
Screwdriver...?

346
00:26:57,275 --> 00:27:01,066
What if your parents get to know?
How caring are they about you?

347
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,733
Is it right to drink like this?
- Hey...

348
00:27:03,108 --> 00:27:05,191
This is ice...
Drink or swallow it?

349
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:06,650
It's a cocktail.

350
00:27:06,816 --> 00:27:09,400
You came from Kakinada
to drink this, huh?

351
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:11,108
The girls here are hot, sir.

352
00:27:12,316 --> 00:27:14,233
You go ahead and try
if you like them so much.

353
00:27:14,483 --> 00:27:17,441
Sir, I don't have the status
or position to tell you.

354
00:27:17,691 --> 00:27:21,275
But everyone is shining under
the flashlights with lipsticks and make up.

355
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:24,733
We don't need faces that shine
under the flashlights.

356
00:27:24,983 --> 00:27:26,400
But a face that
shines like flash.

357
00:27:26,483 --> 00:27:28,400
It's hard to find such faces,
sir.

358
00:27:58,316 --> 00:27:59,941
You asked me not to click pictures earlier.

359
00:28:00,191 --> 00:28:02,400
That is professional.
This is personal.

360
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:11,150
Sir, you saw her just now
and are proposing already?

361
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:14,525
Competition is more for girls like
her, Padma. There should be no lag.

362
00:28:14,608 --> 00:28:17,275
We should propose immediately.
- Sir, I think you are hurrying this.

363
00:28:17,316 --> 00:28:20,525
Yes. I fell for her quickly.
I should mingle quickly.

364
00:28:58,275 --> 00:29:00,983
Padma... - Sir...
Sir, are you about to puke?

365
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:04,400
She drank my defiled drink,
Padma.

366
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:05,983
You don't defile mine. So what?

367
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:09,275
Do you know we are
like half married now?

368
00:29:09,358 --> 00:29:11,275
Just because she drank?
- I will go and get the wedding fixed

369
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:14,108
Sir, the time is not right.
Horoscope says so.

370
00:29:14,358 --> 00:29:16,691
I don't trust time.
I trust my timing.

371
00:29:39,775 --> 00:29:42,066
My husband is not at home.

372
00:29:42,358 --> 00:29:43,469
So?

373
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:48,025
There's no watchman too.
- So?

374
00:29:50,316 --> 00:29:53,983
I drove the car myself.
- So?

375
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:59,108
Dry fruit...
- Dry fruits? Say that.

376
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:01,650
No watchman.
The car's back seat is nice...

377
00:30:01,775 --> 00:30:04,816
Over there... Take them.
Brown... Black...

378
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,816
Mad dry fruit...

379
00:30:09,858 --> 00:30:12,858
What is this aunty saying?
- She is talking about some mad dry fruit...

380
00:30:13,066 --> 00:30:14,983
Don't you know what dry fruit is?
- Who said so?

381
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:18,191
The brown and black nuts...
- Not those - Then?

382
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,624
Dry fruit means a fruit
that's dried up

383
00:30:20,674 --> 00:30:24,172
or a dead fruit or a useless fruit
or a stale fruit.

384
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,525
Is it? Are there
these many types in dry fruits?

385
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,566
Nature is a wonderful thing,
brother.

386
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:31,275
Sister,
he is really a dead dry fruit.

387
00:30:31,316 --> 00:30:32,525
Yes, sister. It's me.

388
00:30:38,983 --> 00:30:40,900
Damn! I missed her.

389
00:30:48,358 --> 00:30:50,108
What is this? What is this?

390
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,150
Do you think it is newspaper
or tissue paper?

391
00:30:52,358 --> 00:30:54,400
How could you use the newspaper
for your personal interest?

392
00:30:54,441 --> 00:30:56,816
What, Paddu?
- Don't Paddu me.

393
00:30:56,983 --> 00:30:58,858
Party is Pammi aunty's and
the photograph is this girl's.

394
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,941
Is she some celebrity
to print such a big picture?

395
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,525
She is a celebrity for me.

396
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:10,275
Your madness is in peaks now.

397
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,316
Will you find her
just because you printed her photograph?

398
00:31:13,358 --> 00:31:15,558
Look, Padma. If she is
crazy about celebrities

399
00:31:15,717 --> 00:31:16,720
she will come
and thank me.

400
00:31:16,858 --> 00:31:19,483
If not, she will yell. That's it.

401
00:31:21,066 --> 00:31:23,066
Be prepared for the second one.

402
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:27,025
We expected heavy wind
but she seems like a cyclone.

403
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:29,608
Let her come.
I will hug the cyclone.

404
00:31:31,274 --> 00:31:32,691
Who is Padma here?
- It's me.

405
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:40,441
I put your name below.

406
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,775
How dare you publish my photo
without my permission?

407
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,900
I was scolding him for the same thing
and you came at the same moment.

408
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:47,150
If you print pictures
according to your will

409
00:31:47,191 --> 00:31:48,733
do you know how many problems
we would have to face?

410
00:31:48,775 --> 00:31:51,191
Hey, are you brainless?
Look at her.

411
00:31:51,358 --> 00:31:52,941
12 Mega pixel eyes.

412
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,816
Lips like the flash.

413
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,025
Height that doesn't need heels.

414
00:31:57,775 --> 00:31:59,566
How could you even give her a special status
when she doesn't like it?

415
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,441
Special status?
- Wait...

416
00:32:01,608 --> 00:32:03,775
What's your name?
- Sitara...

417
00:32:03,983 --> 00:32:05,858
Sitara...
- He found out the name.

418
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,733
Look the trouble you caused to Ms. Sitara.

419
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:09,233
Where did you come from?

420
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,733
Gachibowli... Alekhya homes...

421
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:12,608
Gachibowli... Alekhya homes...

422
00:32:12,775 --> 00:32:13,733
He also got the address.

423
00:32:13,816 --> 00:32:15,025
Tell him the flat number too.

424
00:32:15,775 --> 00:32:17,157
Don't need these extras.

425
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,691
She came all the way from
Gachibowli to scold you.

426
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:23,358
When the birthday
is Pammi aunty's

427
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,365
why would you print
her photographs

428
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,977
as she is concerned in no way?

429
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,025
As a creative head, I don't
know where to put my head.

430
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:29,525
My creativity is
gone with the wind.

431
00:32:29,608 --> 00:32:31,983
Isn't it? Fire him from
the job immediately.

432
00:32:32,025 --> 00:32:33,691
Hello...
I am a permanent employee here.

433
00:32:33,816 --> 00:32:35,233
Who are you?
- Sir?

434
00:32:35,525 --> 00:32:36,922
Have you fired me already?

435
00:32:38,983 --> 00:32:41,191
No one should enter
without an appointment.

436
00:32:41,441 --> 00:32:42,450
Go away.

437
00:32:43,566 --> 00:32:46,066
Do you think she has no one?

438
00:32:46,816 --> 00:32:48,858
I am there for her...

439
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,983
Thank you so much for
an immediate reaction.

440
00:32:51,821 --> 00:32:55,733
If you mess with me,
the effect will be so.

441
00:33:01,525 --> 00:33:02,607
Careful...

442
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:04,413
Padma...

443
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,566
Tell me. - She drank my
defiled drink again.

444
00:33:06,608 --> 00:33:08,608
She will have cold and cough
after drinking but she won't feel love.

445
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:11,108
What did aunty call you
in the party? - Dry fruit...

446
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:12,316
You are exactly a dry fruit.

447
00:33:12,525 --> 00:33:14,150
What is dry fruit actually, sir?
- Get out.

448
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:16,150
Excuse me.
- Please come...

449
00:33:19,983 --> 00:33:21,858
It is his death
anniversary tomorrow.

450
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,983
I need a full-page
ad in your paper.

451
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:26,108
It will cost 10 lakhs.
- 25 is also fine with me.

452
00:33:26,191 --> 00:33:28,316
You are not hesitating when it
comes to money. Who is this?

453
00:33:28,358 --> 00:33:29,358
He is my father.

454
00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:32,275
Father? We will not print it
- Why?

455
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,807
We don't print any ads related
to fathers in our paper.

456
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:36,031
I hate fathers.

457
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:37,775
I hate fathers.

458
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,372
You are performing
this devotional act since 20 years

459
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:56,905
for your son's return.

460
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:59,525
I hope it is fruitful this time.

461
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:00,901
Pandit...

462
00:34:01,465 --> 00:34:04,566
I am doing this
not with hope but trust.

463
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:06,816
My son will return.

464
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,959
Come and perform veneration.
- Yes...

465
00:34:17,566 --> 00:34:21,616
Your trust on God
and love for your son

466
00:34:22,691 --> 00:34:24,608
will get him to you.

467
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:34,066
No one can recognize tears in rain
and cunningness in your face.

468
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,691
You look innocent
doing favors for all.

469
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:40,358
Pray... Pray... he is looking.

470
00:34:45,941 --> 00:34:47,900
How long will you continue this?

471
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:51,691
I am planning to start a trust
on my son's name.

472
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:53,566
The cost doesn't bother me.

473
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:55,733
Trust? - The grief
my son experienced...

474
00:34:56,237 --> 00:34:57,503
Should not happen
to any other son.

475
00:34:58,066 --> 00:34:59,566
If I do such good deeds

476
00:35:00,129 --> 00:35:02,025
I have the hope
my son will return.

477
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:08,358
Padma...
- Sir... Sir...

478
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:11,150
Didn't she come?
- Who? Hari teja?

479
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:12,733
Not Hari teja or Ravi teja...

480
00:35:12,941 --> 00:35:14,650
Sitara...
My Sitara...

481
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:17,483
Sir, is she an employee
of our company to come daily?

482
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:19,983
she might have read our paper
being jobless and come here.

483
00:35:20,066 --> 00:35:22,525
How will she come now?
- We will go if she doesn't come, Padma.

484
00:35:23,062 --> 00:35:25,371
Where is it?
- Sir, this way.

485
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:29,066
Sir, this is the location.

486
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:32,941
Professor Jayashankar Sports Academy?

487
00:35:33,108 --> 00:35:35,983
Padma, what do you think my baby
is doing in a sports academy?

488
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:39,857
Is it so? - What other plans
do girls have, sir?

489
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:22,108
Padma...

490
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:33,358
Sir, she seems like a
huge running race champion.

491
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,649
But you hate races.

492
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:36,566
Race... Race... Race... Race...

493
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,258
Padma,
there are only two films

494
00:36:38,342 --> 00:36:40,191
in the history of Telugu Cinema that
I didn't watch. - What are they, Sir?

495
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:41,941
One is "Race Gurram" and the
other is "Nannaku Prematho."

496
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:42,915
Didn't you find the tickets,
sir?

497
00:36:42,989 --> 00:36:44,400
You should have
brought in black. - No.

498
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,182
The first one because
it has the word "Race"

499
00:36:46,252 --> 00:36:48,831
and the second one because
it has "Father"... I hate both.

500
00:36:52,983 --> 00:36:55,108
Sir, it's better if you
drop it with this girl.

501
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:56,733
Drop her? Drop her?

502
00:36:56,983 --> 00:36:59,275
What does she lack in, huh?
She has a nice figure.

503
00:36:59,525 --> 00:37:00,733
Why doesn't she
drape a silk sari...

504
00:37:00,816 --> 00:37:03,608
And do ads for Chandana Brothers
or Bommana sisters?

505
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:05,673
Does she need to wear those
shorts showing her thighs out

506
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,608
and run like that?
This won't do, Padma.

507
00:37:07,733 --> 00:37:09,691
I will act as if I am encouraging
her and then shut the whole thing.

508
00:37:09,775 --> 00:37:11,733
Sir, you are having such
violent thoughts. - Why won't I?

509
00:37:11,816 --> 00:37:13,275
I had so many hopes on her.

510
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:15,691
I will smack her
if she thinks of races again.

511
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,901
Let's go.

512
00:37:20,483 --> 00:37:22,900
Sir, she saw us.
She recognized us.

513
00:37:23,149 --> 00:37:24,265
Come.

514
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:29,066
Hi... - Hi,
how come you are here?

515
00:37:29,233 --> 00:37:31,108
Wasn't he fired from his job?

516
00:37:32,525 --> 00:37:33,691
Why is he here with you?

517
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:35,650
There is a small problem.

518
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:39,525
He is creating nuisance since
I fired him saying he will die.

519
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:42,483
He attempted suicide
twice until now.

520
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:43,557
As he was going for the
third, I stopped him

521
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,941
and brought him to you.
- Hey, what's your problem?

522
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:46,983
What's my problem, sir?

523
00:37:47,066 --> 00:37:49,733
Ma'am is asking you. Tell her
why you attempted suicide.

524
00:37:49,858 --> 00:37:52,400
Ma'am, he will not give me my job
unless you forgive me.

525
00:37:52,566 --> 00:37:53,733
Damn! okay...

526
00:37:53,816 --> 00:37:54,775
I forgive you. Get lost now.

527
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,775
She forgave me, sir. Let's go

528
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,358
Ma'am isn't saying it heart fully.

529
00:37:58,483 --> 00:38:00,275
Her face expression and words
speak two different things.

530
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:01,566
Can't I sense that at the least?

531
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,691
Ma'am, why don't you
say it heart fully?

532
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:04,900
What do you mean?

533
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:08,691
If you hug me tightly
letting our hearts touch

534
00:38:08,775 --> 00:38:10,858
and if what you say reaches me,
you are saying it heart fully.

535
00:38:10,941 --> 00:38:13,025
Come... Come... Come...
- What should reach, huh? Are you mad?

536
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,858
I will not say it.
- You die then.

537
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:18,566
Die? I didn't get any material
to die right now.

538
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:20,275
I brought it.

539
00:38:20,858 --> 00:38:22,816
Sir, should I die for your love?

540
00:38:23,274 --> 00:38:24,483
This isn't poison. It's scotch.

541
00:38:24,566 --> 00:38:25,775
I will die. I will die.

542
00:38:25,983 --> 00:38:26,941
I will die.
- Hey... No...

543
00:38:27,025 --> 00:38:28,149
He is drinking it.

544
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:29,441
I want forgiveness.
He wants a hug.

545
00:38:29,525 --> 00:38:31,524
He will die. Come and hug me.
- Hey... No... Please...

546
00:38:31,608 --> 00:38:32,858
I want forgiveness.
He wants a hug.

547
00:38:32,941 --> 00:38:34,108
Hey... No... Please...

548
00:38:34,566 --> 00:38:37,025
He drank it.
Come and hug me. Come.

549
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,651
This is so strong.
Didn't you mix soda?

550
00:38:41,374 --> 00:38:44,858
Hey, are you playing dramas?

551
00:38:44,941 --> 00:38:46,316
Don't act smart with me.

552
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:48,275
I have a goal in life.

553
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,566
I risked a lot to be here.

554
00:38:50,983 --> 00:38:52,775
Hey, don't you have any goals?

555
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:54,775
Why not? I have many goals...

556
00:38:54,858 --> 00:38:56,858
But the first one is
to make you fall in love with me.

557
00:38:57,149 --> 00:38:58,816
Idiot...
- Sitara...

558
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:08,358
"You touched me like lightening."

559
00:39:08,608 --> 00:39:11,941
"You raised fire
in this tiny heart."

560
00:39:12,024 --> 00:39:15,191
"Don't poke me with your looks."

561
00:39:15,316 --> 00:39:19,608
"Don't do things I do not like."

562
00:39:21,566 --> 00:39:24,733
"I am crazy now and
I am liking this wonder."

563
00:39:24,858 --> 00:39:28,025
"I would die for you, my love."

564
00:39:28,316 --> 00:39:31,608
"I gave you my heart.
Show some mercy."

565
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:34,858
"You are the first one
I fell in love with."

566
00:39:35,025 --> 00:39:38,316
"I am crazy now and
I am liking this wonder."

567
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:41,483
"I would die for you, my love."

568
00:39:41,816 --> 00:39:45,108
"I gave you my heart.
Show some mercy."

569
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:49,025
"You are the first one
I fell in love with."

570
00:40:02,732 --> 00:40:08,441
"You touched me like lightening."

571
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:15,608
"You raised fire
in this tiny heart."

572
00:40:29,733 --> 00:40:33,608
"You touched me like lightening."

573
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,900
"I like your face.
I don't like your race."

574
00:40:46,025 --> 00:40:49,358
"Give me a chance
and I will change it."

575
00:40:49,441 --> 00:40:52,608
"Girls your age are engaged
with cellphones."

576
00:40:52,816 --> 00:40:55,733
"Focus on my love, my dear."

577
00:40:56,191 --> 00:40:58,316
"I am crazy now..."

578
00:40:59,566 --> 00:41:02,441
"I am liking this wonder."

579
00:41:02,983 --> 00:41:04,983
"I gave you my heart."

580
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:08,691
"Show some mercy."

581
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:14,566
"I am crazy now and
I am liking this wonder."

582
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:17,941
"I would die for you, my love."

583
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,358
"I gave you my heart.
Show some mercy."

584
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:24,608
"You are the first one
I fell in love with."

585
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,108
"I am crazy now and
am liking this wonder."

586
00:41:28,275 --> 00:41:31,441
"I would die for you,
my love."

587
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:34,858
"I gave you my heart.
Show some mercy."

588
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:38,650
"You are the first one
I fell in love with."

589
00:41:58,691 --> 00:42:01,108
"I am crazy now."

590
00:42:12,233 --> 00:42:15,483
"You are my fate.
You are my heart."

591
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:18,525
"I tattooed you on my heart."

592
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:22,233
"Such a great lover
and soul mate like me"

593
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:25,649
"will be lucky to you
and there's no doubt in this."

594
00:42:25,731 --> 00:42:28,150
"I am crazy now."

595
00:42:29,108 --> 00:42:32,025
"I am liking this wonder."

596
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,316
"I gave you my heart."

597
00:42:35,816 --> 00:42:38,733
"Show some mercy."

598
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:44,191
"I am crazy now and
I am liking this wonder."

599
00:42:44,275 --> 00:42:47,566
"I would die for you, my love."

600
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:50,900
"I gave you my heart.
Show some mercy."

601
00:42:51,025 --> 00:42:54,233
"You are the first one
I fell in love with."

602
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:57,608
"I am crazy now and
I am liking this wonder."

603
00:42:57,816 --> 00:43:01,191
"I would die for you, my love."

604
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:06,106
You are nurturing
hundreds of orphans, sir.

605
00:43:06,218 --> 00:43:07,655
You will find your son for sure.

606
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:10,095
We will leave now.
We will take your leave..

607
00:43:10,145 --> 00:43:11,137
Thank you.

608
00:43:11,399 --> 00:43:12,733
What is this?

609
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:15,358
10 crores?

610
00:43:16,195 --> 00:43:17,538
You are doing better than me.

611
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,030
Leave. - Okay, sir. Greetings.
- Greetings..

612
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:24,284
Look... you separated
one person from him

613
00:43:24,373 --> 00:43:25,921
he is aiding hundreds now.

614
00:43:26,131 --> 00:43:28,525
Don't you feel
this is a greater loss than that?

615
00:43:29,835 --> 00:43:31,733
I knew this would happen.

616
00:43:32,733 --> 00:43:33,882
Let's see...

617
00:43:38,446 --> 00:43:40,983
I didn't come to ask you.

618
00:43:42,038 --> 00:43:45,191
I know today is the day
Siddhu left our home.

619
00:43:46,635 --> 00:43:49,108
Despite being
occupied with work.

620
00:43:50,358 --> 00:43:52,358
The pain you are going through...

621
00:43:52,558 --> 00:43:53,900
We can understand.

622
00:43:54,032 --> 00:43:55,400
Siddhu will come for sure.

623
00:43:57,566 --> 00:43:59,608
He is torturing me every day...

624
00:44:00,444 --> 00:44:02,192
He is like a nail
in a running shoe.

625
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:04,483
I have to do something to him.

626
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:06,608
You should get someone
do it for you.

627
00:44:06,817 --> 00:44:08,442
What are you implying?
- Yes.

628
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,483
Cat is needed to kill a rat.

629
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:14,025
Dog is needed to kill a cat.
Fox is needed to kill a dog.

630
00:44:14,233 --> 00:44:16,650
There is lion to kill the fox.

631
00:44:17,317 --> 00:44:19,275
That lion is Sujatha.

632
00:44:19,979 --> 00:44:22,085
Alias Singam Sujatha...

633
00:44:44,486 --> 00:44:45,775
Hey! Who are you?

634
00:44:45,858 --> 00:44:47,567
Cyberabad Police...

635
00:44:47,775 --> 00:44:50,400
Hey... you might have seen
a lion in the jungle.

636
00:44:50,525 --> 00:44:54,525
You might have seen it in zoo,
T.V and YouTube.

637
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,858
But you might not have seen it
in the uniform.

638
00:44:57,108 --> 00:44:58,400
Sujatha...

639
00:44:58,567 --> 00:45:00,108
Singam Sujatha...

640
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,817
Tell me. What's your problem?

641
00:45:26,025 --> 00:45:27,733
Actually...
- Come on. Tell me.

642
00:45:27,817 --> 00:45:30,358
A guy is torturing
me since a week, sir.

643
00:45:30,483 --> 00:45:33,358
Hey, how dare you torture me?
I am the M.L.A's son.

644
00:45:33,525 --> 00:45:35,567
I will make sure your name is
nowhere in the police records.

645
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:40,275
Hey... My name will
not be in the records.

646
00:45:40,525 --> 00:45:42,775
There will be records on my name.

647
00:45:42,983 --> 00:45:45,817
Sujatha... Singam Sujatha...

648
00:45:49,817 --> 00:45:50,838
Tell me...

649
00:45:50,983 --> 00:45:53,108
A guy is torturing me...

650
00:45:53,192 --> 00:45:55,442
You have said that already.
What next, ma'am?

651
00:45:55,858 --> 00:45:58,025
If you can come and warn him...

652
00:45:58,108 --> 00:46:00,233
Hey, Sujatha. You are not
giving a damn about my warning.

653
00:46:00,317 --> 00:46:02,270
There are arguments
in the assembly

654
00:46:02,357 --> 00:46:03,644
and clamor in the State about me.

655
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,567
I can discipline you
with a single phone call.

656
00:46:05,692 --> 00:46:09,775
Hey, I wasn't brought up with discipline
like a plant in a park.

657
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:12,525
I grew up like a tree
in a jungle.

658
00:46:12,817 --> 00:46:14,608
I will encounter you.

659
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:19,775
Where were we?
- If you can come and warn him...

660
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,442
Tell me where he stays...
Don't tell me what to do.

661
00:46:23,445 --> 00:46:25,483
He comes wherever I go, Sir.

662
00:46:25,567 --> 00:46:27,067
Silence...
- Idiot...

663
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,086
He won't speak now.

664
00:46:36,275 --> 00:46:37,387
You can go...

665
00:46:37,692 --> 00:46:39,192
We will look after him.

666
00:46:39,275 --> 00:46:40,483
Thank you, sir.

667
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:43,442
Excuse me...

668
00:46:46,233 --> 00:46:47,348
I am coming.

669
00:46:47,483 --> 00:46:50,483
Everyone is coming and
practicing but my Sitara isn't coming.

670
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,108
Some Police jeep is here...

671
00:46:53,192 --> 00:46:54,650
They might have come
for collections...

672
00:46:57,358 --> 00:46:58,942
Sir...
- What?

673
00:47:03,025 --> 00:47:04,608
Why did she come
in the Police jeep?

674
00:47:04,858 --> 00:47:07,691
Has she complained on us?
- What have we done to complain about?

675
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,817
I just loved her.
- What you did is not called love

676
00:47:09,941 --> 00:47:11,900
Is it called adoration?
- It's called torture.

677
00:47:13,192 --> 00:47:14,354
It's him.

678
00:47:15,692 --> 00:47:17,317
She is pointing at us.

679
00:47:18,192 --> 00:47:19,983
Sir,
don't show too much violence.

680
00:47:20,067 --> 00:47:21,233
Don't you want me to kill him?

681
00:47:21,323 --> 00:47:22,525
Warning will do.

682
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,358
"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star..."

683
00:47:29,525 --> 00:47:31,733
"I am a Power Star
once provoked."

684
00:47:31,979 --> 00:47:33,483
He seems violent, Sir

685
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:34,969
He does.

686
00:47:35,525 --> 00:47:37,527
Escape...
- Hey!

687
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,983
What are you guys doing here?
- We came here looking for girls.

688
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:41,364
We came to watch the games, Sir.

689
00:47:42,733 --> 00:47:44,983
I will rip your skin off
if you answer insensibly.

690
00:47:45,108 --> 00:47:47,858
We mean we came to look at the girls
playing the games, Sir.

691
00:47:47,942 --> 00:47:49,030
Wow! Super...

692
00:47:49,179 --> 00:47:50,775
Do you know whom you are talking to?

693
00:47:50,858 --> 00:47:52,900
Sujatha here.

694
00:47:52,983 --> 00:47:54,317
Padma here. So what?

695
00:47:55,567 --> 00:47:57,192
Are you giving counters
to my encounters?

696
00:47:57,317 --> 00:47:58,567
I will shoot you.

697
00:48:00,067 --> 00:48:02,858
Sir, up until now,
we have seen lions in jungle

698
00:48:02,933 --> 00:48:04,567
T.V and YouTube.

699
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,400
But for the first time, I am
looking at a lion in the uniform.

700
00:48:08,275 --> 00:48:10,858
Have you seen
that aggressiveness and style?

701
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:12,940
It seems attractive
to a guy like me only.

702
00:48:13,096 --> 00:48:14,685
How come she is not be impressed?

703
00:48:14,942 --> 00:48:16,066
We in front of that cutout?

704
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:17,900
Pull it off... Pull it off...
- No Padma... No...

705
00:48:17,983 --> 00:48:19,650
You did all this and you
want to drop in the middle?

706
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:22,483
Shut up!
Sir has something for her...

707
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,275
She has something for him.

708
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:25,858
What are we doing in between?

709
00:48:25,942 --> 00:48:28,150
Hey... What do you mean
by something?

710
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:31,275
It means both of you
are lovers, Sir.

711
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:33,733
Do you think this girl fell
for me? - Long back... - Yes.

712
00:48:33,817 --> 00:48:36,441
What is he saying?
- No girl with sense will ever love you.

713
00:48:36,525 --> 00:48:38,316
We cannot imagine her with you
even in our dreams.

714
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,566
Don't trust his words.
- Both of them are jealous of me.

715
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:43,233
Sir, if a girl has a problem

716
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:45,067
she goes to her father,
brother or lover.

717
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,608
Though you look like a father,
you are not her brother for sure.

718
00:48:47,737 --> 00:48:49,900
You will become the lover then.
- Yes.

719
00:48:50,483 --> 00:48:51,718
Madam...

720
00:48:52,108 --> 00:48:53,900
Why didn't you tell us
that you are from his side? - Why?

721
00:48:53,975 --> 00:48:55,400
You could have told us.
- Yes.

722
00:48:56,317 --> 00:48:57,275
He got scared.

723
00:48:57,325 --> 00:49:00,845
To speak honestly, both of you
are made for each other, Sir.

724
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:15,400
All the best, Sir.
She is waiting. You go now.

725
00:49:15,483 --> 00:49:16,775
We will leave.
- Bye, Sir.

726
00:49:16,858 --> 00:49:18,003
Thank you, bro.

727
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:34,275
He will not disturb you now.

728
00:49:34,442 --> 00:49:35,983
Thank you...
Thank you so much, Sir.

729
00:49:36,067 --> 00:49:37,578
Why thanks and sorry
between close ones

730
00:49:37,663 --> 00:49:39,656
and someone who is going
to become your dear one?

731
00:49:41,025 --> 00:49:42,233
What are you going to become?

732
00:49:42,483 --> 00:49:44,275
Something...
- What?

733
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:46,817
You will not understand.
It is Mongolian lovers language.

734
00:49:47,525 --> 00:49:49,150
By the way,
what's your mobile number?

735
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:53,150
Why?
- 9711326575.

736
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:55,817
I will get in touch
on WhatsApp in the night. Bye...

737
00:49:57,608 --> 00:50:01,400
Anyone who misses his lover
will opt alcohol or suicide.

738
00:50:01,483 --> 00:50:02,858
But you have moved aside.

739
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:04,608
Padma...

740
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:08,233
If we fall behind a girl,
she will treat us like an idiot.

741
00:50:08,483 --> 00:50:10,608
But if we get her linked
to another big idiot,

742
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:12,025
She feels we are
better than him.

743
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,150
That is why I did so.

744
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:15,150
But who can be a bigger
idiot than you, sir?

745
00:50:37,029 --> 00:50:38,887
Come on!

746
00:50:43,316 --> 00:50:44,603
Come on! - Come on!

747
00:50:48,592 --> 00:50:49,704
Come on!

748
00:50:50,983 --> 00:50:52,074
No!

749
00:50:55,525 --> 00:50:56,658
No!

750
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,317
I asked you to loose.
Why did you win?

751
00:51:05,544 --> 00:51:08,864
Sorry, sir. I fed the horse
extra grains last night.

752
00:51:08,914 --> 00:51:11,817
It ran super quick. Do you
think I will give this reason?

753
00:51:12,387 --> 00:51:14,317
You said you would pay me
25 lakhs if I lose...

754
00:51:14,517 --> 00:51:16,459
The opponent promised to pay 50 if I won.

755
00:51:16,555 --> 00:51:19,483
How dare you cheat
working under me?

756
00:51:21,931 --> 00:51:25,775
Isn't it cheating asking your
own horse to lose for money?

757
00:51:26,828 --> 00:51:28,170
Everyone is an idiot here.

758
00:51:28,533 --> 00:51:30,751
I am a bigger one.

759
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,650
I am such a big idiot that
along with winning the race,

760
00:51:34,235 --> 00:51:36,032
I accepted another contract

761
00:51:36,766 --> 00:51:38,510
To kill you.

762
00:51:39,668 --> 00:51:40,830
Die.

763
00:51:41,262 --> 00:51:43,421
Run, run and die.

764
00:52:18,826 --> 00:52:20,942
Money makes many things.

765
00:52:21,733 --> 00:52:23,150
Being unaware of it

766
00:52:23,608 --> 00:52:24,733
He passed away.

767
00:52:26,733 --> 00:52:28,817
Who is it?
- Who else?

768
00:52:29,692 --> 00:52:30,957
Singam Sujatha.

769
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:34,192
Sir, he is pickpocketing
in our area.

770
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:38,275
Hey, Pickpocketing in my area?

771
00:52:38,442 --> 00:52:39,817
How dare you?

772
00:52:39,983 --> 00:52:41,983
Pickpocketing in
Singam Sujatha's area?

773
00:52:42,108 --> 00:52:45,191
Pickpocketing? - Sir,
hit me anywhere but not here.

774
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,566
What's there?
Kavitha, sir. - Read it out then.

775
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:51,191
It's not a poem to read, sir.
She is studying B. Tech 1st year.

776
00:52:51,275 --> 00:52:54,567
Love? - Yes, sir.
I committed theft for her.

777
00:52:55,233 --> 00:52:56,817
Sir, Relax.

778
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:57,942
Relax.

779
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,775
Love?
- Yes, sir.

780
00:53:00,983 --> 00:53:02,692
Give me your wallet.
- It's here.

781
00:53:04,983 --> 00:53:07,150
100? What will you get for a 100?

782
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:12,275
Enough? Is it enough?
- Give me everything, sir.

783
00:53:12,733 --> 00:53:14,442
Take it.
Take it.

784
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,858
Buy her whatever she asks for.

785
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:18,150
Ok, sir.
- Go. - Wait. Come here.

786
00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:19,942
Don't trust his words, sir.

787
00:53:20,217 --> 00:53:22,733
Only lovers know about love.
Not you Policemen.

788
00:53:22,858 --> 00:53:24,525
What's this nuisance instead
of putting him in the cell?

789
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:28,525
Parrot shouldn't be in the cage
and lover shouldn't be in the jail.

790
00:53:28,733 --> 00:53:32,191
None of you will understand
a lover's pain except me.

791
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:33,567
I understood.

792
00:53:35,854 --> 00:53:37,223
Sir is in love.

793
00:53:37,331 --> 00:53:39,743
You should distribute, grow
and make love win like this.

794
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:43,358
Brother, despite playing
with guns and rowdies

795
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:45,150
You reminded me that I
too have a loving heart.

796
00:53:45,817 --> 00:53:46,817
Are you feeling shy, sir?

797
00:53:46,949 --> 00:53:50,650
Poetry comes kicking from the
inside once you fall in love.

798
00:53:50,783 --> 00:53:52,654
Give me another quote.
- It wasn't poetry.

799
00:53:52,738 --> 00:53:54,233
He is just putting you
up in the sky - You wait.

800
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:57,317
Because of people like you, sir is
on duty instead of dating someone.

801
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,358
What dating, bro? She is not
even picking up my calls.

802
00:54:00,483 --> 00:54:03,775
I get blue ticks as she reads my messages
but she doesn't reply.

803
00:54:03,942 --> 00:54:06,858
Seems she doesn't like me.
- She might be feeling shy.

804
00:54:06,983 --> 00:54:09,358
All girls are the same.
We need to take the lead.

805
00:54:09,442 --> 00:54:11,608
You have to buy gifts, take
her to dinners and the movies.

806
00:54:11,692 --> 00:54:12,817
Come with me. I will take you.
- Why are you going?

807
00:54:13,025 --> 00:54:14,150
To make love successful.

808
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:15,400
Your love?
- Sir's love...

809
00:54:15,817 --> 00:54:17,525
Brother,
do you think this time is right?

810
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:19,400
Mr. Sujatha...
- You can put the hand down and talk.

811
00:54:19,483 --> 00:54:21,858
Kids get into the school with a dull face
as soon as the bell rings.

812
00:54:21,975 --> 00:54:24,692
But in the evening, they come running
with laughter after the same bell.

813
00:54:24,942 --> 00:54:27,275
Bell is the same. The
timing is different - Got it.

814
00:54:31,233 --> 00:54:32,942
Mr. Sujatha..
Mr. Sujatha..

815
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,400
Isn't the house this way?

816
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:37,150
House is this way but what will you give her
as she opens the door?

817
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:38,536
Respect.

818
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,108
Girls these days don't look
for respect. They want biscuit.

819
00:54:42,192 --> 00:54:44,067
Do you want me to get biscuits
from Karachi Bakery?

820
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:46,275
I can't spoon feed you for everything.

821
00:54:46,567 --> 00:54:49,817
Bro, don't be angry.
Give me an idea.

822
00:54:49,942 --> 00:54:51,858
None of the girls fall
for you without a gift.

823
00:54:51,942 --> 00:54:54,942
The gift you give should contain
the weight the words 'I love you' do.

824
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:57,108
Did you bring anything?
- I didn't get anything, bro

825
00:54:57,192 --> 00:54:58,483
I knew it.

826
00:54:58,567 --> 00:55:01,025
What do we do now?
Shall we give this?

827
00:55:02,317 --> 00:55:04,108
Do you think this is
the Silver Medal won by Sindhu?

828
00:55:04,192 --> 00:55:05,567
It's like the rope
tied to buffaloes.

829
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,150
True. What to do now?

830
00:55:09,067 --> 00:55:10,150
Wow!

831
00:55:11,067 --> 00:55:12,358
It means you brought it already.

832
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:14,524
Don't we get the net ready
while going for fishing?

833
00:55:14,608 --> 00:55:15,900
I love your fishing.

834
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:17,264
I too love fishing.

835
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,108
Why did you come?

836
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:23,608
My duty is always
to reach the beauty.

837
00:55:23,692 --> 00:55:24,942
What is this?
- Gift.

838
00:55:25,067 --> 00:55:27,025
What are you looking at, sir?
Tell her.

839
00:55:27,317 --> 00:55:28,065
What do you want me to say?

840
00:55:28,108 --> 00:55:29,525
Have you forgotten already?
Give it here. I will tell her.

841
00:55:30,192 --> 00:55:32,483
I closed my eyes and
thought about you all night.

842
00:55:32,608 --> 00:55:35,150
I felt this chain would look
good on you so I brought it.

843
00:55:35,233 --> 00:55:37,567
A beautiful gift for a
beautiful girl. I love you.

844
00:55:39,275 --> 00:55:41,233
This is what you want to say, right?
- That's all.

845
00:55:41,317 --> 00:55:43,483
He expressed all my feelings
perfectly. Please accept my love

846
00:55:43,567 --> 00:55:44,887
The chain is yours, isn't it?

847
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,900
Chain might be mine but
love is Mr. Sujatha's.

848
00:55:47,733 --> 00:55:49,150
Stop your nuisance.

849
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:51,150
Leave right now.
- Don't talk like that.

850
00:55:51,275 --> 00:55:52,442
Please try to accept my love

851
00:55:52,525 --> 00:55:54,191
Don't create a nuisance here.
Get out.

852
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:55,900
This isn't nuisance.

853
00:55:56,192 --> 00:55:57,555
It is love sense.

854
00:55:58,191 --> 00:56:00,143
Ma'am, listen to my
heartbeat again and again.

855
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,389
Please accept my feelings.

856
00:56:01,439 --> 00:56:03,192
I have told you already.
- Who are you?

857
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:05,317
What is this nuisance?
Who are they?

858
00:56:05,442 --> 00:56:07,358
Do they sell flats?
Or do they buy papers?

859
00:56:07,482 --> 00:56:09,567
What is this? What is your
problem? - Love problem, sir

860
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,608
You will not understand
our youth's problem. Leave.

861
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:13,942
What's not to
understand in this?

862
00:56:14,025 --> 00:56:15,663
The guy is in love
with the girl.

863
00:56:15,749 --> 00:56:17,787
You are against it as a father.

864
00:56:18,025 --> 00:56:20,525
That's not the matter. You will
not understand. Please leave.

865
00:56:20,608 --> 00:56:22,191
I understood now.

866
00:56:22,275 --> 00:56:23,729
You are in love
with his daughter

867
00:56:23,821 --> 00:56:25,469
and he is against it as
your father. Is that it?

868
00:56:25,561 --> 00:56:26,942
No, sir.

869
00:56:27,025 --> 00:56:29,442
He looks like my
father or her father.

870
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:31,192
But you are unable to
see the lover in him.

871
00:56:31,275 --> 00:56:32,567
Our sir is in love here.

872
00:56:33,817 --> 00:56:36,733
He looks like an old guy
and he is in love?

873
00:56:37,317 --> 00:56:38,317
What is that look?

874
00:56:38,393 --> 00:56:39,611
You look like the vendor
selling ice sticks

875
00:56:39,686 --> 00:56:42,192
in front of Pullela Gopichand
Academy. Do you need love?

876
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,900
Does it match anywhere
for the both of you?

877
00:56:45,733 --> 00:56:47,817
You look like a thief
stealing empty beer bottles.

878
00:56:50,775 --> 00:56:51,839
Wear the chain.

879
00:56:53,317 --> 00:56:54,650
Get into the jeep. Come on.

880
00:57:03,983 --> 00:57:06,317
The weather is great
- What a romantic place!

881
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,191
This is the perfect
place for lovers like us.

882
00:57:08,275 --> 00:57:10,483
Why do you say us? Is there
a triangle going on here?

883
00:57:10,566 --> 00:57:11,942
You will not
understand my angle.

884
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:13,796
It is enough if she
understands my angle.

885
00:57:14,358 --> 00:57:15,983
Sitara, please come.

886
00:57:19,025 --> 00:57:20,483
Sir, control.

887
00:57:20,609 --> 00:57:22,858
You are not Rajasekhar
from Ankusam to be aggressive.

888
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:24,358
You are a lover boy now.
Calm down.

889
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:25,777
I very well know
where to calm down

890
00:57:25,858 --> 00:57:27,340
where to increase the
dose and where to win, bro.

891
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:28,983
No one can stop you now, bro
- Come on.

892
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:34,567
Down. Stop.

893
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,775
There's nothing wrong is taking a
loan from the World Bank for her.

894
00:57:42,942 --> 00:57:44,229
Oh.

895
00:57:44,804 --> 00:57:46,458
Okay.
- Why did you fall, sir?

896
00:57:46,692 --> 00:57:49,983
Bro, looking at Sitara, I feel
like falling again and again.

897
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,067
Oh! Good covering.

898
00:57:52,817 --> 00:57:54,900
Go and get two lime juices.

899
00:57:55,692 --> 00:57:57,108
We need some privacy.

900
00:57:57,983 --> 00:57:59,775
You need some brains, sir.

901
00:57:59,858 --> 00:58:01,817
She already knew
the gift was mine.

902
00:58:01,929 --> 00:58:04,775
If I go and get the juices now,
she will confirm love is mine.

903
00:58:04,983 --> 00:58:06,233
Shall I go?
- No.

904
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:08,483
Why take that risk?
I will bring.

905
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,983
I will get lime juice for you.

906
00:58:13,067 --> 00:58:15,317
Sir, stomach.

907
00:58:19,361 --> 00:58:20,525
Don't tuck your tummy
in for too long.

908
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,678
You will die from
shortage of breath.

909
00:58:24,983 --> 00:58:26,125
Ma'am.

910
00:58:26,483 --> 00:58:29,358
Don't stare like that.
Say something.

911
00:58:29,482 --> 00:58:30,525
What do I talk?

912
00:58:30,858 --> 00:58:33,038
You are using him to
make me fall for you.

913
00:58:33,122 --> 00:58:34,313
You think I
don't know?

914
00:58:34,729 --> 00:58:37,359
Who gave him the
Police job anyways?

915
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:39,650
Give me two lime juices.
- He and his tummy.

916
00:58:40,733 --> 00:58:42,858
Does he think I can't notice
when he breathes in?

917
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:44,150
Idiot.

918
00:58:44,481 --> 00:58:46,608
Shameless fellow, Shameless
fellow, Mindless fellow.

919
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,858
Someone is thinking of me.

920
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:53,317
Take this.

921
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,479
Shift to that orange.

922
00:58:58,694 --> 00:59:00,741
All the fruits
are on the left.

923
00:59:00,846 --> 00:59:02,820
This orange... This orange...

924
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:05,009
Love has to be felt
without any force.

925
00:59:05,442 --> 00:59:07,483
Is it wrong to want to be closer
to the girl I love?

926
00:59:07,567 --> 00:59:09,900
No. But it's wrong to be behind
her even after she refuses.

927
00:59:15,912 --> 00:59:19,442
Love doesn't just come like
that. I feel frustrated.

928
00:59:19,942 --> 00:59:21,442
You are sitting beside
and torturing me.

929
00:59:21,819 --> 00:59:23,775
And they are doing the
same sitting far away.

930
00:59:23,858 --> 00:59:25,110
Down... Down...

931
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,150
If I feel yours to be love,
I should feel the same for them.

932
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:30,817
Super figure.

933
00:59:31,275 --> 00:59:33,108
What's the difference
between you both?

934
00:59:46,392 --> 00:59:49,275
I know how to love
but I don't know how to say it.

935
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,150
I know how to share love
but not how to convince.

936
00:59:52,358 --> 00:59:55,233
Don't compare my love with
anyone. I don't like it.

937
01:00:01,567 --> 01:00:03,900
Guys like them are everywhere.

938
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:06,983
Guys like me are rare.

939
01:00:08,025 --> 01:00:12,025
Hey, you have seen the
lover boy in me until now.

940
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,317
Now you will see
the power in me.

941
01:00:21,067 --> 01:00:22,358
What happened?

942
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:26,358
What?
What?

943
01:00:26,442 --> 01:00:30,442
What's your problem if we drink
beer and flirt with the girls?

944
01:00:31,567 --> 01:00:35,566
One whistle and Jabbar, Akbar,
Mallesh, Yadgiri, Suresh,

945
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:38,942
Praneeth, Naveen, Balu and
the entire gang will be here.

946
01:00:40,483 --> 01:00:41,775
What? What?

947
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,317
Who are you raising
your hand at?

948
01:00:46,317 --> 01:00:47,525
Don't put your hands on me.

949
01:00:48,192 --> 01:00:49,567
Are you ignoring me?

950
01:01:00,108 --> 01:01:01,108
Hey...

951
01:01:01,233 --> 01:01:03,483
Action is mine but not yours.

952
01:01:03,733 --> 01:01:04,858
I am coming.

953
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:06,692
Hey, hit me.

954
01:01:06,775 --> 01:01:08,566
Singam Sujatha here.
Hit me.

955
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:09,823
Hit me.

956
01:01:10,775 --> 01:01:11,692
Wait.

957
01:01:11,942 --> 01:01:13,817
Can't you understand Telugu?

958
01:01:13,983 --> 01:01:15,733
Hit me. Hit me.

959
01:01:20,608 --> 01:01:21,858
Tell me.

960
01:01:21,942 --> 01:01:23,525
She is looking.
I will lose my prestige.

961
01:01:23,608 --> 01:01:25,400
One chance. One chance please.

962
01:01:25,483 --> 01:01:26,805
What are you looking at?
Push him.

963
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:43,525
What's your concept?

964
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:45,775
Will you get beaten up only
from him? Won't you let me hit?

965
01:01:45,941 --> 01:01:47,233
Won't you let me
show my heroism?

966
01:02:03,692 --> 01:02:05,025
Mr. Sujatha, where were you?

967
01:02:05,108 --> 01:02:07,567
Stop your Nandi Award acting.

968
01:02:07,692 --> 01:02:09,933
How many times have I asked
you to give me one guy

969
01:02:10,069 --> 01:02:11,983
like a beggar at
a traffic signal?

970
01:02:12,096 --> 01:02:13,686
Did you give me a chance?
You got all the credit.

971
01:02:13,777 --> 01:02:15,650
Sir, though I fought with them,
it counts as yours.

972
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:17,370
How is that possible?
- She is leaving now.

973
01:02:17,454 --> 01:02:19,723
If she turns, it's an
indication she fell for you.

974
01:02:29,608 --> 01:02:31,275
Enough.
- Yes!

975
01:02:43,067 --> 01:02:44,692
Sir, look at him.

976
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:48,900
Crazy fellow.
Let's meet him.

977
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:01,316
I should tell him about
something and its urgent.

978
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,358
Is it that urgent?

979
01:03:02,483 --> 01:03:05,567
No, it's personal. I have
to tell you very straight.

980
01:03:06,483 --> 01:03:09,358
Evening Sky Bar at 7'o clock.

981
01:03:09,483 --> 01:03:10,983
Okay.

982
01:03:19,233 --> 01:03:20,234
Hi.

983
01:03:21,483 --> 01:03:25,524
Did you get a bouquet to say 'I Love You'
as soon as I called you?

984
01:03:26,524 --> 01:03:28,191
I mean.

985
01:03:28,483 --> 01:03:31,816
You don't have that much scene
and I don't have time to love.

986
01:03:31,983 --> 01:03:33,316
No, Sitara.
Listen to me.

987
01:03:34,191 --> 01:03:35,649
Don't you get it?

988
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:38,983
You get him with you every day.
Where is he?

989
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,869
No girl will ever love
a waste fellow like you

990
01:03:44,013 --> 01:03:46,311
who uses others to get the girl.

991
01:03:46,733 --> 01:03:49,441
Correct. I don't know how to show my love.

992
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:51,649
I don't know how to express my love.

993
01:03:52,399 --> 01:03:54,608
I don't know how to take it
when you say 'No'.

994
01:03:54,733 --> 01:03:57,691
But one thing is true.
I am in love with you.

995
01:03:59,292 --> 01:04:01,274
I have nothing to do
with your lies and facts.

996
01:04:01,743 --> 01:04:04,910
My ambition is get an
gold medal in race.

997
01:04:05,002 --> 01:04:07,128
My family doesn't
know that I am here.

998
01:04:07,407 --> 01:04:09,205
The competition is in a week's time.

999
01:04:09,457 --> 01:04:12,191
So, please don't waste my time and
please don't show me this face again.

1000
01:04:17,316 --> 01:04:18,733
What, sir? Did she
accept your love?

1001
01:04:18,899 --> 01:04:20,483
No. She rejected me.

1002
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:22,858
What is that?

1003
01:04:23,149 --> 01:04:25,899
I brought this to celebrate
if your love is successful.

1004
01:04:26,691 --> 01:04:28,315
In times of a sad occasion
and also a happy occasion.

1005
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:30,358
It has always been our companion
- I have heard this before.

1006
01:04:30,441 --> 01:04:31,524
Give it.

1007
01:04:32,274 --> 01:04:35,566
Sir.
Sir, Past is past.

1008
01:04:35,691 --> 01:04:37,983
Whatever happened has happened.
Forget it, sir

1009
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:43,358
How do I forget?
Where do I lack?

1010
01:04:43,459 --> 01:04:44,733
I look okay, right?

1011
01:04:44,849 --> 01:04:48,066
I know and they know the number of people
I rejected for her love.

1012
01:04:50,983 --> 01:04:54,608
I now understand how it
feels to be rejected.

1013
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:57,691
Sir, do you want me to mix soda?

1014
01:04:59,066 --> 01:05:01,358
She has a manufacturing defect.

1015
01:05:01,483 --> 01:05:04,524
I would have to blame her dad
for this. It's not her fault.

1016
01:05:10,774 --> 01:05:13,524
Do we need songs now?
- Sir, I didn't sing.

1017
01:05:13,607 --> 01:05:15,066
Where is the sound coming from?

1018
01:05:16,816 --> 01:05:18,566
Sir, here.

1019
01:05:20,138 --> 01:05:21,858
I think it's Sitara's phone.
- Give it here.

1020
01:05:23,066 --> 01:05:24,483
Dad calling.

1021
01:05:24,649 --> 01:05:26,358
Daddy.

1022
01:05:26,649 --> 01:05:28,608
Dear, how are you?
Are you fine?

1023
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:32,191
No. I feel like the worst.
- Who are you?

1024
01:05:32,274 --> 01:05:35,233
I am destroyed completely
falling in love with your daughter.

1025
01:05:35,319 --> 01:05:36,774
How did you get hold
of my daughter's phone?

1026
01:05:38,697 --> 01:05:41,483
Do you think
your daughter is studying here?

1027
01:05:41,733 --> 01:05:45,816
She is wearing shorts,
showing her thighs.

1028
01:05:45,899 --> 01:05:48,608
Running in races.

1029
01:05:49,774 --> 01:05:51,899
Do you understand
whom you are talking about?

1030
01:05:55,525 --> 01:06:00,172
Hello. Is this Sitara's dad?
- Yes.

1031
01:06:01,483 --> 01:06:03,024
Correct phone.

1032
01:06:03,108 --> 01:06:05,691
There's nothing wrong
in scolding you.

1033
01:06:05,858 --> 01:06:09,316
You shouldn't have a daughter
and then leave her like that.

1034
01:06:09,441 --> 01:06:15,314
You should know if she's studying,
running or walking. Go to sleep.

1035
01:06:17,816 --> 01:06:19,108
Sleep.

1036
01:06:19,902 --> 01:06:21,483
Who is that?

1037
01:06:25,191 --> 01:06:26,358
Padma.

1038
01:06:28,608 --> 01:06:29,774
Padma.

1039
01:06:33,566 --> 01:06:35,149
Padma.
- Sir.

1040
01:06:35,732 --> 01:06:37,441
Good morning

1041
01:06:37,524 --> 01:06:39,858
Why are you laughing like that?
- You shook him out yesterday, sir.

1042
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,649
Sitara's father.
You played with him.

1043
01:06:41,774 --> 01:06:45,441
When did I meet him?
- You were on the phone with him.

1044
01:06:45,816 --> 01:06:47,691
You are not human when you drink.

1045
01:06:47,858 --> 01:06:50,691
You knew that before...
- Yes.

1046
01:06:50,774 --> 01:06:52,491
That is why I got you drunk.
Situation demands.

1047
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:54,524
Situation demands.

1048
01:06:54,691 --> 01:06:55,739
Slowly, sir.

1049
01:06:57,024 --> 01:07:00,774
Reasons for half the problems in this world
are fathers and alcohol.

1050
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:02,733
I hate fathers. I hate liquors.

1051
01:07:02,858 --> 01:07:03,858
She hates you.

1052
01:07:04,066 --> 01:07:06,108
Your Voice changed.
- Not mine. Look there.

1053
01:07:06,608 --> 01:07:08,983
Who is that?
- Why did you come into her life?

1054
01:07:11,274 --> 01:07:13,733
She toiled day and night for her goal.

1055
01:07:14,066 --> 01:07:16,858
You have changed her
entire life in a day - Me?

1056
01:07:16,941 --> 01:07:19,441
She lied to her family,
as they don't understand.

1057
01:07:19,856 --> 01:07:22,441
She told you the truth,
as you would understand.

1058
01:07:22,979 --> 01:07:25,691
That brought her life back
to the beginning again.

1059
01:07:26,024 --> 01:07:27,899
Where is she?
- Where else?

1060
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,941
With your phone call, her
father arrived all of a sudden,

1061
01:07:30,024 --> 01:07:32,274
Took her to Bangalore
and fixed her wedding.

1062
01:07:32,524 --> 01:07:33,721
Wedding?

1063
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:40,691
Aunty, look at this. This
would look beautiful on Sitara.

1064
01:07:42,649 --> 01:07:44,941
Sitara,
which one out of the two?

1065
01:07:46,233 --> 01:07:49,441
What's in giving me a choice
when you can't give what I want?

1066
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:52,066
Why do you talk like that?
- Aren't you ready yet?

1067
01:07:54,352 --> 01:07:56,274
I can understand your anger.

1068
01:07:57,082 --> 01:08:00,149
My decision might have hurt you.

1069
01:08:00,654 --> 01:08:04,149
But I believe you will be happy
throughout your life.

1070
01:08:04,897 --> 01:08:07,108
Trust me. Get ready.

1071
01:08:10,942 --> 01:08:12,031
Brother

1072
01:08:12,399 --> 01:08:14,465
I think this is the only
wedding in recent times

1073
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:16,006
performed without wedding cards.

1074
01:08:16,108 --> 01:08:17,483
What is this, Brother-in-law?

1075
01:08:17,608 --> 01:08:19,441
What was the need to arrange
her wedding all of a sudden?

1076
01:08:19,566 --> 01:08:20,881
I don't like you getting
a match from outside

1077
01:08:20,951 --> 01:08:22,705
when my son is
the perfect match.

1078
01:08:22,887 --> 01:08:26,858
I need a husband for my daughter
but not a son-in-law for me.

1079
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:29,858
He should be man enough
to look after my stud farm,

1080
01:08:30,233 --> 01:08:33,566
Have a grip on horses
and be the Most Wanted Jockey.

1081
01:08:33,944 --> 01:08:35,774
Does your son have all
these qualifications?

1082
01:08:35,983 --> 01:08:37,441
Brother-in-law..

1083
01:08:38,397 --> 01:08:40,647
My son-law has all
these qualifications.

1084
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:42,871
He is also my best friend's son.

1085
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:44,899
They are here.

1086
01:08:45,158 --> 01:08:46,691
He is here.

1087
01:09:02,441 --> 01:09:03,983
Hi, uncle
- Welcome, son-in-law.

1088
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:05,733
God bless you.

1089
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:15,649
The effects you gave
aren't ordinary.

1090
01:09:15,942 --> 01:09:17,438
Her father looks like
he's really fast.

1091
01:09:17,547 --> 01:09:19,602
He got the wedding fixed
within 24 hours of your call.

1092
01:09:20,358 --> 01:09:23,441
I made a mistake, Padma.
I need to meet Sitara urgently.

1093
01:09:26,062 --> 01:09:27,858
Sir, get the bride.

1094
01:09:43,274 --> 01:09:44,816
Sir, exit.

1095
01:09:52,108 --> 01:09:54,024
Sir, sit here. Better view.

1096
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:08,024
Saw how dull Sitara is. Seems
like she doesn't like the marriage.

1097
01:10:10,149 --> 01:10:13,649
Saw how solid the groom is?
Looks like he is really happy.

1098
01:10:17,024 --> 01:10:20,274
I disturbed her unnecessarily while
she was toiling for her goal.

1099
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:23,024
How can I sit quiet when she is
getting married without her consent?

1100
01:10:23,107 --> 01:10:25,233
What, sir? Will you stop the wedding?

1101
01:10:25,483 --> 01:10:27,024
She alone was disturbed
when you halted her goal.

1102
01:10:27,274 --> 01:10:30,483
If you halt the wedding, all of them will
be disturbed and beat the hell out of us

1103
01:10:30,566 --> 01:10:32,733
Don't know how she might react
looking at you.

1104
01:10:32,899 --> 01:10:33,983
Is it?

1105
01:10:34,941 --> 01:10:36,316
Hey, Photographer!

1106
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,983
Ask the bride to smile a little.

1107
01:10:40,233 --> 01:10:42,691
Photographs won't look
good without a smile.

1108
01:10:58,652 --> 01:11:00,774
Look, Sitara smiled at me.

1109
01:11:00,858 --> 01:11:03,191
She is not angry.
She likes me.

1110
01:11:03,316 --> 01:11:05,858
What is this confidence when
the wedding is in 10 minutes?

1111
01:11:05,941 --> 01:11:09,024
Her smile is my confidence.
Wedding won't happen for sure.

1112
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:10,542
It will happen, sir.

1113
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:18,773
One minute, Dad.

1114
01:11:20,899 --> 01:11:21,850
What?

1115
01:11:22,983 --> 01:11:24,733
Dad, I don't like this marriage

1116
01:11:32,858 --> 01:11:34,125
What?

1117
01:11:34,358 --> 01:11:35,458
What are you talking?

1118
01:11:35,941 --> 01:11:38,441
I am in love with a
guy and he is here

1119
01:11:40,774 --> 01:11:42,358
Who is he?

1120
01:11:42,858 --> 01:11:44,441
It's him.

1121
01:11:50,024 --> 01:11:52,108
Number one racer in Hyderabad.

1122
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:58,983
Me?
- Sir, when did you become a racer?

1123
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:03,566
Dad, you fixed this wedding
as the groom is a reputed jockey.

1124
01:12:03,733 --> 01:12:06,149
But the guy I love is a
better jockey than him.

1125
01:12:07,066 --> 01:12:08,165
Me?

1126
01:12:08,274 --> 01:12:10,608
Dad, you want a man who can
look after your race course.

1127
01:12:10,774 --> 01:12:12,858
The Most Wanted Jockey.
Is that it?

1128
01:12:13,108 --> 01:12:14,733
He has all the qualities.

1129
01:12:15,066 --> 01:12:16,566
Why did she get me into this?

1130
01:12:16,649 --> 01:12:19,983
Let them both compete.
I will marry whoever wins.

1131
01:12:21,191 --> 01:12:23,774
Compete with him? That guy?

1132
01:12:24,358 --> 01:12:27,066
Why? Are you scared
you will lose?

1133
01:12:27,233 --> 01:12:29,899
If you really are brave,
compete with him and win.

1134
01:12:30,024 --> 01:12:32,399
I will then put my head down
and get married to you.

1135
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:34,066
Okay? Will you play?

1136
01:12:34,191 --> 01:12:35,858
Why would he play?

1137
01:12:35,983 --> 01:12:37,524
You defamed me
in front of everyone.

1138
01:12:37,608 --> 01:12:39,066
You.
- Rajeev Reddy.

1139
01:12:46,649 --> 01:12:47,819
Dad.

1140
01:12:47,911 --> 01:12:50,108
My son will play.

1141
01:12:50,983 --> 01:12:52,524
He will definitely win.

1142
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:30,285
Rajeev Reddy.

1143
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:32,799
There's nothing wrong in what
your daughter just spoke.

1144
01:13:33,769 --> 01:13:35,399
You wanted to get her a man.

1145
01:13:35,961 --> 01:13:39,399
But she wanted her husband to be a man.

1146
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:42,024
Good. Come on.

1147
01:13:52,364 --> 01:13:56,233
Mahendra Reddy's son
Siddharth Reddy is a man.

1148
01:14:00,608 --> 01:14:02,550
He is the care of
address to vigor.

1149
01:14:02,756 --> 01:14:04,540
He is the permanent
address to victory.

1150
01:14:06,485 --> 01:14:08,742
Do you know what
my first wish is?

1151
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:12,270
Now that my son
returned after 20 years

1152
01:14:13,233 --> 01:14:14,774
Wedding with your daughter.

1153
01:14:18,816 --> 01:14:19,816
No.

1154
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:22,524
He will take it as a challenge.

1155
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:25,983
They will compete during
the coming Derby cup.

1156
01:14:27,869 --> 01:14:30,274
I will arrange my son's wedding
right here after a month's time.

1157
01:14:30,524 --> 01:14:32,483
All of you should come again.

1158
01:14:33,911 --> 01:14:37,024
As my son raises his head and ties
the knots with the pride of victory,

1159
01:14:37,554 --> 01:14:39,691
Your daughter has to put her head down
and get married to him.

1160
01:14:40,024 --> 01:14:41,524
All of them should watch it.

1161
01:14:45,118 --> 01:14:46,256
Let's go.

1162
01:15:09,038 --> 01:15:11,804
Horse races are not as easy as
falling in love.

1163
01:15:12,872 --> 01:15:15,441
You should have guts
to get onto a horse.

1164
01:15:16,335 --> 01:15:18,316
We have victory in our blood.

1165
01:15:19,899 --> 01:15:21,858
Get ready for the challenge.

1166
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:24,081
Come on.

1167
01:15:42,892 --> 01:15:44,549
Why did you do so?

1168
01:15:44,599 --> 01:15:47,364
I did it for a reason.
- Did you? - Yes.

1169
01:15:47,414 --> 01:15:51,583
I was working hard with an aim,
he tortured me on the name of love.

1170
01:15:51,633 --> 01:15:54,050
Now he would know about that torture.

1171
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,536
I don't like to marry
that Jockey fellow at all.

1172
01:15:56,586 --> 01:15:59,906
And that Siddhu does not like
these races and horses.

1173
01:16:00,659 --> 01:16:04,844
They will focus in his race
and I will focus on my aim.

1174
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:06,883
I gained this time for that.

1175
01:16:07,243 --> 01:16:09,750
What is your anger?
Is this any betting game?

1176
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,673
It's life.

1177
01:16:11,912 --> 01:16:13,866
I take betting games seriously.

1178
01:16:14,446 --> 01:16:16,945
Don't you know how serious
would I take life, Father?

1179
01:16:16,995 --> 01:16:18,554
If that girl had said
not to like this marriage

1180
01:16:18,596 --> 01:16:19,668
and to be loving someone else

1181
01:16:19,738 --> 01:16:20,808
I would have cancelled this.

1182
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:22,830
But she threw a challenge.

1183
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:25,775
A man should have that ego.

1184
01:16:26,289 --> 01:16:28,215
And he is Mahendra Reddy's son.

1185
01:16:28,265 --> 01:16:29,616
How much should he have?

1186
01:16:29,666 --> 01:16:31,033
My son should win.

1187
01:16:31,392 --> 01:16:33,735
Become winner by marrying that girl.

1188
01:16:37,256 --> 01:16:39,255
No house will have such a dirty nonsense.

1189
01:16:40,368 --> 01:16:41,926
Dad is coming please, Mom.

1190
01:16:41,976 --> 01:16:44,579
Please, Mom.
- Ask him for yourself.

1191
01:16:44,629 --> 01:16:47,251
Just ask him once please.
- Lakshmi.

1192
01:16:48,117 --> 01:16:49,407
What is the discussion with mom?

1193
01:16:49,457 --> 01:16:54,079
Dad,
to join pilot course I need the signature.

1194
01:16:54,129 --> 01:16:55,295
How many times do I tell you?

1195
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:57,605
My children should be in front of my eyes.

1196
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,538
I don't like to send you far away.

1197
01:16:59,588 --> 01:17:02,658
Forget about such thoughts
and look for any course in the city.

1198
01:17:06,503 --> 01:17:08,538
I can't believe it.

1199
01:17:08,588 --> 01:17:10,855
Oh, no! What a stroke
has she given, sir?

1200
01:17:10,905 --> 01:17:12,466
This is to bet taking a revenge.

1201
01:17:12,516 --> 01:17:14,869
Sir, I am not of a status
or position to say you.

1202
01:17:14,919 --> 01:17:16,245
But, let us go urgently to Hyderabad

1203
01:17:16,325 --> 01:17:19,047
and live in peace publishing
full page ads in paper.

1204
01:17:19,589 --> 01:17:20,898
What are you thinking, sir?

1205
01:17:20,948 --> 01:17:23,585
You will not get an idea
of learn horse riding

1206
01:17:23,627 --> 01:17:25,082
and go for that horse race, right?

1207
01:17:25,132 --> 01:17:26,319
Have you seen that horse once, wait..

1208
01:17:27,847 --> 01:17:30,642
Your father-in-law.

1209
01:17:33,608 --> 01:17:36,089
Are you the number one racer in Hyderabad?

1210
01:17:36,823 --> 01:17:38,836
Do you know who Mahendra Reddy is?

1211
01:17:39,551 --> 01:17:41,457
Do you know his background?

1212
01:17:41,507 --> 01:17:44,083
Sir, we know Mahindra tractors
but don't know who Mahendra Reddy is.

1213
01:17:44,133 --> 01:17:47,749
Mahendra Reddy is the king of races.

1214
01:17:47,912 --> 01:17:53,565
It is impossible for you to win
over son of that Mahendra Reddy.

1215
01:17:53,927 --> 01:17:55,211
Forget about winning,

1216
01:17:55,328 --> 01:17:58,083
You don't even have qualification
to play such royal games.

1217
01:17:58,133 --> 01:18:00,881
It is your wish either you escape
or run away from here.

1218
01:18:01,297 --> 01:18:02,271
Out!

1219
01:18:06,853 --> 01:18:08,722
Why did he give us a warning now?

1220
01:18:08,772 --> 01:18:10,371
Is Mahendra Reddy's son so great?

1221
01:18:10,421 --> 01:18:13,459
Actually he is not the son of
Mahendra Reddy, but it is me.

1222
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:17,237
Sir, looks like your brain chip got ruined
With the stroke that girl.

1223
01:18:17,287 --> 01:18:21,474
How can you be Mahendra Reddy's son?
- I am the one who ran away at the age of 5

1224
01:18:22,182 --> 01:18:25,791
It is me living like an orphan
from the past 20 years.

1225
01:18:25,841 --> 01:18:27,319
Then is he duplicate?

1226
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:30,142
I thought my dad is happy without me.

1227
01:18:30,192 --> 01:18:33,631
I am unable to believe
that he entered my life.

1228
01:18:33,681 --> 01:18:35,889
How did he actually come into my place?

1229
01:18:35,939 --> 01:18:38,424
Why has he come?
I'll find out.

1230
01:18:42,086 --> 01:18:43,834
Scent, sir.
Scent from Dubai.

1231
01:18:43,884 --> 01:18:46,228
Please buy.
- Hey, wait.

1232
01:18:46,278 --> 01:18:47,770
Is this really a perfume or fake?

1233
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:49,416
Sir, why do you doubt?

1234
01:18:49,466 --> 01:18:50,575
Try once.

1235
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:51,552
Pay if you like the scent.

1236
01:18:52,128 --> 01:18:54,132
Sir, this is Rajesh Khanna scent.

1237
01:18:54,182 --> 01:18:56,321
If you use this scent, girls may see you.

1238
01:18:56,371 --> 01:18:58,302
This is 'Rana Daggubati' scent.

1239
01:18:58,483 --> 01:19:00,405
If you use this scent,
girls will be behind you.

1240
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,495
Will Milky beauty 'Tamanna' fall flat?

1241
01:19:02,545 --> 01:19:04,560
Even bulky beauty Namitha will fall.

1242
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:05,470
Try it.

1243
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,500
Smell it with your nose.

1244
01:19:10,161 --> 01:19:11,432
You will get girls.

1245
01:19:11,482 --> 01:19:13,529
What is this?

1246
01:19:30,119 --> 01:19:31,038
What's all this?

1247
01:19:31,596 --> 01:19:32,574
Where am I?

1248
01:19:32,825 --> 01:19:34,566
Who are you guys?

1249
01:19:34,616 --> 01:19:37,304
You trapped me with a scent
and hitting me with a ball

1250
01:19:42,203 --> 01:19:43,312
You?

1251
01:19:43,887 --> 01:19:45,004
What have I done?

1252
01:19:45,054 --> 01:19:46,739
Why is this sudden strike on me?

1253
01:19:46,789 --> 01:19:48,906
I will explain it later.

1254
01:19:49,152 --> 01:19:51,689
Tell me who is the young guy
with your old man?

1255
01:19:51,739 --> 01:19:53,465
He is son of our sir.

1256
01:19:53,515 --> 01:19:56,005
I will say the truth. Stop it.

1257
01:19:56,510 --> 01:20:00,770
That old man brought that guy and asked
him to act like son of our Mahendra sir.

1258
01:20:02,629 --> 01:20:05,421
Do you know the payment he gets his acting?

1259
01:20:05,471 --> 01:20:06,512
10 Crores.

1260
01:20:06,562 --> 01:20:07,715
Who are you?

1261
01:20:07,765 --> 01:20:10,126
He is the real son of Mahendra Reddy.

1262
01:20:10,176 --> 01:20:10,977
Original.

1263
01:20:11,027 --> 01:20:13,914
Oh sir, is it you?

1264
01:20:14,381 --> 01:20:15,848
I saw long back in your childhood.

1265
01:20:15,882 --> 01:20:18,114
What exactly happened?

1266
01:20:18,164 --> 01:20:20,025
That old fellow would kill me if I say.

1267
01:20:21,152 --> 01:20:23,853
It is important for me
to know the truth. Say it.

1268
01:20:25,384 --> 01:20:26,396
I will tell.

1269
01:20:27,316 --> 01:20:29,512
Your dad is not cruel as you think.

1270
01:20:29,915 --> 01:20:31,304
He is a very good man.

1271
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:35,403
You misunderstood him.

1272
01:20:36,299 --> 01:20:38,021
To know about your dad

1273
01:20:38,071 --> 01:20:40,443
You should first know about
the cruel acts of your grandfather.

1274
01:20:41,643 --> 01:20:46,073
After knowing about death of your mom,
he brought you and your dad to him.

1275
01:20:46,678 --> 01:20:49,669
Actually, he wanted a jockey
who could earn money for him.

1276
01:20:49,831 --> 01:20:50,908
Not your dad.

1277
01:20:51,323 --> 01:20:53,915
And also not you
born to your mom whom he hated.

1278
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:56,720
Thus, he created distance
between you and your dad.

1279
01:20:56,770 --> 01:20:58,813
He made you hate your dad.

1280
01:20:58,863 --> 01:21:00,503
I hate you, father.
I hate you.

1281
01:21:00,553 --> 01:21:02,963
He finally made you go away
from house by yourself.

1282
01:21:05,092 --> 01:21:07,722
Do you know why
your father married again?

1283
01:21:07,772 --> 01:21:09,682
You may not need a wife.

1284
01:21:09,732 --> 01:21:14,259
Kids need love of mother at this age
and support of dad after growing up.

1285
01:21:14,671 --> 01:21:16,437
That is the reason.

1286
01:21:18,417 --> 01:21:19,544
Ok, Father.

1287
01:21:19,871 --> 01:21:23,027
Not for me but will marry for my son.

1288
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:25,993
But, I will have a word with him
and take the decision.

1289
01:21:26,043 --> 01:21:30,528
If you say him right now, he may fear
thinking to lose your love on him.

1290
01:21:30,578 --> 01:21:31,585
Your wish, Father.

1291
01:21:32,964 --> 01:21:36,430
After you left, your grandpa thought
your dad would forget about you.

1292
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:39,037
But all these years

1293
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:42,756
There wasn't a day he did not search
for you Nor worship and nor God.

1294
01:21:44,795 --> 01:21:47,347
For the past years
he has been waiting for you.

1295
01:21:47,397 --> 01:21:50,002
He is been buying clothes
and gifts on your birthday.

1296
01:21:50,558 --> 01:21:52,588
Is waiting with a hope for you to come back.

1297
01:21:56,241 --> 01:22:00,815
You know how far has his
love on you taken him?

1298
01:22:02,248 --> 01:22:06,525
He decided to start a trust with 100 crores
for the orphans on your name.

1299
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:09,507
But your grandpa did not like that.

1300
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:13,173
He will form the trust
if his son is not found, right?

1301
01:22:14,624 --> 01:22:15,965
What if he is found?

1302
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:20,287
You should act for a month
as son of my son and grandson to me.

1303
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:23,783
You should make him feel that
it's better without a son.

1304
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:26,372
You should make him
throw you out of the house.

1305
01:22:26,422 --> 01:22:27,733
This deal is good for me.

1306
01:22:27,783 --> 01:22:30,465
In the happiness of getting back the son
being searched from many years

1307
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:34,632
Your dad didn't even think for once
whether it was his real son or not.

1308
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:39,443
Your grandpa cheated him so much.

1309
01:22:43,457 --> 01:22:45,587
If he knows that I told you the truth

1310
01:22:46,443 --> 01:22:47,579
He would kill me.

1311
01:22:48,957 --> 01:22:51,801
My life is in your hands now.
- Don't worry.

1312
01:22:52,294 --> 01:22:53,906
Thanks for saying the truth.

1313
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:55,849
One small request.

1314
01:22:57,079 --> 01:22:58,778
Take care of my dad.

1315
01:23:05,663 --> 01:23:07,215
Sir, let's go.

1316
01:23:07,265 --> 01:23:09,842
We will say the truth to your dad.
- What shall I say?

1317
01:23:09,892 --> 01:23:13,932
My dad could not bear his son brought up
for 5 years leaving him.

1318
01:23:14,367 --> 01:23:17,960
If he knows that his dad
has been cheating on him for 50 years

1319
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:19,509
Can he withstand?

1320
01:23:21,327 --> 01:23:25,479
Can he withstand knowing that
the one beside him is not his blood?

1321
01:23:25,529 --> 01:23:26,668
But sir, that is...

1322
01:23:26,718 --> 01:23:29,472
It is not to say truth to dad now.

1323
01:23:29,752 --> 01:23:31,527
But we should teach a
lesson to my grandpa.

1324
01:23:31,944 --> 01:23:32,930
I will.

1325
01:23:33,127 --> 01:23:35,913
I will teach him a lesson
at the right place and time.

1326
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:40,462
There will not be anyone as unlucky as me.

1327
01:23:41,094 --> 01:23:42,616
Mom died in my childhood.

1328
01:23:43,064 --> 01:23:46,079
Can't call dad with love
though he is in front of me.

1329
01:23:48,078 --> 01:23:52,101
Will my dad identify me
If I stand before him?

1330
01:23:53,542 --> 01:23:57,120
I feel like seeing my dad once.

1331
01:25:48,846 --> 01:25:50,811
Oh, sir, you?
Hello, sir.

1332
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:54,482
What man, no proper time for you to jog?

1333
01:25:54,532 --> 01:25:56,981
I felt like seeing so came off.

1334
01:25:58,346 --> 01:26:00,460
I mean, felt like jogging and I'm doing it.

1335
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:02,870
Any problem, sir. Shall I help?

1336
01:26:03,488 --> 01:26:05,681
No problem.
- We may have many issues among us, sir.

1337
01:26:05,731 --> 01:26:07,441
A bet is a bet, let me see.

1338
01:26:07,491 --> 01:26:08,831
Step aside, sir.

1339
01:26:11,931 --> 01:26:14,431
Sir, this looks like some big problem

1340
01:26:14,881 --> 01:26:16,761
Mechanic has to come.

1341
01:26:17,855 --> 01:26:19,814
Sir, shall I drop you?

1342
01:26:19,864 --> 01:26:20,826
I will drop you.

1343
01:26:20,876 --> 01:26:22,181
No need. I will go.

1344
01:26:22,904 --> 01:26:24,479
Why? You should not get on my bike?

1345
01:26:24,529 --> 01:26:28,551
Yes, sir, you have these big cars. So, you
will not get on our bikes and bicycles.

1346
01:26:29,370 --> 01:26:30,893
Where is your bike?
- Sir?

1347
01:26:30,943 --> 01:26:33,837
Bike is near that turning.
I will bring it here.

1348
01:26:40,354 --> 01:26:41,893
Sir, stop.

1349
01:26:42,245 --> 01:26:44,390
I need your bike for an hour, please, sir.

1350
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,612
What, should give bike for an hour?

1351
01:26:45,662 --> 01:26:48,017
Look man, anyone would ask for a lift
stopping the bike.

1352
01:26:48,067 --> 01:26:49,390
You are asking for bike itself.

1353
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,194
Need is such, please, sir.

1354
01:26:51,244 --> 01:26:53,724
Will anyone give Rs. 25000 worth bike
just because someone asked.

1355
01:26:53,774 --> 01:26:56,686
After 25 years, I got a chance
to drive with my dad.

1356
01:26:56,736 --> 01:26:58,987
Don't compare 25000 with
25 years of distance.

1357
01:26:59,037 --> 01:27:00,622
Take how much you want.

1358
01:27:00,672 --> 01:27:02,539
Give me the bike. Please, sir.

1359
01:27:02,947 --> 01:27:05,034
Brother, keep it with you.

1360
01:27:05,371 --> 01:27:08,008
You touched me with the father emotion.
Take it.

1361
01:27:08,058 --> 01:27:08,948
Thank you, sir.

1362
01:27:13,272 --> 01:27:14,191
Sir.

1363
01:27:14,378 --> 01:27:15,273
Come on.

1364
01:27:29,997 --> 01:27:31,787
Shall we go?
- Yes, let's go.

1365
01:27:33,284 --> 01:27:40,029
"The relation of many lives
and from when is this affection?"

1366
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:43,859
"Time played a game
and relation brought together."

1367
01:27:43,909 --> 01:27:47,276
"Life giving me birth
and a reflection of love."

1368
01:27:58,764 --> 01:28:00,065
Hey, Candy floss.

1369
01:28:02,557 --> 01:28:04,805
Sir, will you eat Candy floss?
- I don't want.

1370
01:28:05,732 --> 01:28:07,998
Me and my dad used to eat a lot.

1371
01:28:08,989 --> 01:28:12,489
Not just candy floss. But memories
of childhood are also very sweet, sir.

1372
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:14,456
I want one.

1373
01:28:14,967 --> 01:28:16,204
Give me two candy floss.

1374
01:28:18,429 --> 01:28:20,004
I don't have change.
- Keep it.

1375
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:38,800
Done.

1376
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:42,482
You still have it?
- It would finish if I eat.

1377
01:28:46,445 --> 01:28:47,564
Ok. Come.

1378
01:28:48,715 --> 01:28:50,784
Can I ask you one thing?
- Sir.

1379
01:28:50,834 --> 01:28:51,853
Ask, sir.

1380
01:28:52,113 --> 01:28:54,188
Looking at the challenge
made by that girl on that day

1381
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:56,798
I still don't understand whether
she has love or problem with you.

1382
01:28:57,114 --> 01:28:58,487
Oh, no! Looks like he found it out.

1383
01:28:58,537 --> 01:29:00,829
When there is an issue,
it means love exists, right, sir?

1384
01:29:00,879 --> 01:29:02,765
Oh.
- Sir.

1385
01:29:03,387 --> 01:29:04,899
I heard yours too was a love marriage.

1386
01:29:04,949 --> 01:29:07,636
Why don't you give me some tips
with your experience, sir?

1387
01:29:07,974 --> 01:29:08,874
Stop the bike.

1388
01:29:08,924 --> 01:29:10,577
Sir, what happened?

1389
01:29:10,627 --> 01:29:12,308
Did I speak anything wrong?

1390
01:29:15,259 --> 01:29:16,247
Look.

1391
01:29:16,585 --> 01:29:19,562
Why do we love parents
though they hit or scold us from childhood?

1392
01:29:19,763 --> 01:29:21,571
Because there is loyalty in their love.

1393
01:29:21,886 --> 01:29:23,361
Does your love have loyalty?

1394
01:29:24,487 --> 01:29:28,425
There is a meaning to be giving love
in the word loving.

1395
01:29:28,759 --> 01:29:31,656
Give and you don't need tips
from anybody else.

1396
01:29:35,145 --> 01:29:38,784
I thought dad would speak about mom,
why has dad said so?

1397
01:29:40,996 --> 01:29:42,854
Let me think about the babe first.

1398
01:29:48,291 --> 01:29:49,137
Sir..

1399
01:29:49,187 --> 01:29:52,476
It's very risky at this time.
- Only risk would be left if we don't risk.

1400
01:30:17,861 --> 01:30:20,667
Oh no, she is driving me crazy.

1401
01:30:20,976 --> 01:30:23,262
I never saw her in that angle.

1402
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:25,950
Siddhu, control.

1403
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:28,460
Thank you.

1404
01:30:31,183 --> 01:30:32,844
Control.

1405
01:30:32,894 --> 01:30:34,942
Control, Siddhu.

1406
01:30:36,072 --> 01:30:37,705
What are you doing here?

1407
01:30:37,755 --> 01:30:40,680
Yes, it's me. If not, will Prabhas
and Pawan Kalyan come for you?

1408
01:30:40,730 --> 01:30:42,384
Don't speak like a crazy guy.
Why did you come?

1409
01:30:42,919 --> 01:30:44,930
You wanted to get married.
Come let's get married.

1410
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:46,585
Are you mad?
What marriage?

1411
01:30:46,635 --> 01:30:47,774
You said you love me, right?

1412
01:30:47,824 --> 01:30:48,832
Come, we shall run away.

1413
01:30:48,882 --> 01:30:51,166
You want to run away?
I'm not coming.

1414
01:30:51,216 --> 01:30:53,319
I will take if you come
else I will carry you.

1415
01:30:53,369 --> 01:30:55,025
How?
- Like this.

1416
01:30:56,861 --> 01:31:00,116
It would be nice if a girl falls
for a boy real quick.

1417
01:31:02,524 --> 01:31:03,897
Sorry babe.

1418
01:31:03,947 --> 01:31:07,712
An elderly man said the one fearing troubles
should not love. Thus, I am risking. Come.

1419
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:14,683
Careful, sir.

1420
01:31:16,574 --> 01:31:18,038
Sir, you didn't plaster her nose.

1421
01:31:18,088 --> 01:31:20,524
In that case, she would've died.
- Oh sorry, sir.

1422
01:31:39,685 --> 01:31:40,860
Do you have any sense?

1423
01:31:40,910 --> 01:31:43,400
I knew that you are a big idiot.

1424
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:45,406
You showed your true color.

1425
01:31:45,665 --> 01:31:47,924
Not you, but all men are the same.

1426
01:31:47,974 --> 01:31:49,850
Why? Are ladies so cheap?

1427
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:52,745
Are our goals not any goals?
Are our Ambitions not any Ambitions?

1428
01:31:52,795 --> 01:31:56,286
As you disturbed me not caring
about my dreams?

1429
01:31:56,336 --> 01:31:57,833
That day I trapped you into marriage.

1430
01:31:57,883 --> 01:32:00,295
I will not marry you, whatever you do.

1431
01:32:00,345 --> 01:32:01,166
Go away.

1432
01:32:02,398 --> 01:32:03,222
Are you done?

1433
01:32:03,621 --> 01:32:05,380
Have you scolded me enough?

1434
01:32:05,949 --> 01:32:07,584
I don't know to do magic with words.

1435
01:32:07,882 --> 01:32:09,258
I do not know to cheat at all.

1436
01:32:09,514 --> 01:32:11,423
But will go any far for love.

1437
01:32:12,032 --> 01:32:12,992
Look there once.

1438
01:32:27,079 --> 01:32:29,288
This is your goal, your life
and your ambition, right?

1439
01:32:30,068 --> 01:32:31,026
All the best.

1440
01:32:31,617 --> 01:32:32,426
Go.

1441
01:32:32,476 --> 01:32:33,461
Thank you.

1442
01:32:36,563 --> 01:32:37,707
All the best.

1443
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:40,414
Thanks. Bye.

1444
01:33:01,548 --> 01:33:03,024
Come on..

1445
01:33:06,988 --> 01:33:08,174
Come on..

1446
01:33:18,117 --> 01:33:19,881
Yay..

1447
01:33:22,698 --> 01:33:25,110
Congrats, Sitara. Well done.
- Thank you, sir.

1448
01:33:25,294 --> 01:33:26,793
Thank you..
- Keep it up.

1449
01:33:32,763 --> 01:33:33,886
Congratulations.

1450
01:33:34,056 --> 01:33:36,169
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1451
01:33:36,219 --> 01:33:37,376
I am so happy now.

1452
01:33:39,399 --> 01:33:40,375
Sorry.

1453
01:33:40,726 --> 01:33:42,427
I misunderstood you.

1454
01:33:42,477 --> 01:33:43,318
It's okay.

1455
01:33:44,595 --> 01:33:46,442
Shall we elope?
- What?

1456
01:33:48,249 --> 01:33:49,520
Actually.

1457
01:33:50,295 --> 01:33:51,282
I love you.

1458
01:33:52,635 --> 01:33:55,678
Let us go somewhere,
get married and be happy.

1459
01:33:56,368 --> 01:33:58,338
Shall we go or be happy?

1460
01:33:58,524 --> 01:33:59,595
I didn't get you.

1461
01:33:59,645 --> 01:34:01,844
If we go away now, not just your family

1462
01:34:02,791 --> 01:34:03,786
But even my family will be separated.

1463
01:34:03,836 --> 01:34:04,879
Your family?

1464
01:34:04,929 --> 01:34:07,320
Mahendar Reddy is no other but my dad.

1465
01:34:15,349 --> 01:34:16,304
Siddhu.

1466
01:34:17,082 --> 01:34:18,843
From now, I'm there for you.

1467
01:34:40,664 --> 01:34:45,590
"Oh Sitara, Sitara..
Oh, Sitara.."

1468
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:49,322
"I was a vagabond before."

1469
01:34:49,916 --> 01:34:55,408
"Oh Sitara, Sitara..
Oh, Sitara.."

1470
01:34:55,458 --> 01:34:58,869
"Share the love with all your heart."

1471
01:34:59,433 --> 01:35:04,459
"It is true that you are mine.
Our love story is Magadheera."

1472
01:35:04,509 --> 01:35:08,735
"I will ride over your beauty."

1473
01:35:09,363 --> 01:35:14,223
"I will have your dreams completely.
I will put a shelter in your heart."

1474
01:35:14,273 --> 01:35:18,894
"Will the people with you say no?"

1475
01:35:18,944 --> 01:35:24,837
"Oh Sitara, Sitara..
Oh, Sitara.."

1476
01:35:24,887 --> 01:35:28,508
"Share the love with all your heart."

1477
01:35:39,523 --> 01:35:44,386
"You came straight and gave me boons."

1478
01:35:44,436 --> 01:35:49,195
"You did some miracle to change me."

1479
01:35:49,245 --> 01:35:54,200
"I used to be frustrated
and now in to a trance."

1480
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:58,255
"By the time I was going crazy,
you pushed in with hurry."

1481
01:35:58,305 --> 01:36:03,245
"Just walk with me.
I wouldn't ask you for more."

1482
01:36:03,295 --> 01:36:07,503
"I will be like a torch light to your eyes."

1483
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:12,982
"You can pair with me.
You can be part of my attitude."

1484
01:36:13,032 --> 01:36:17,255
"I will be around you all the time."

1485
01:36:17,703 --> 01:36:23,606
"Oh Sitara, Sitara..
Oh, Sitara.."

1486
01:36:23,656 --> 01:36:27,251
"I was a vagabond before."

1487
01:36:27,574 --> 01:36:33,437
"Oh Sitara, Sitara..
Oh, Sitara.."

1488
01:36:33,487 --> 01:36:37,084
"Share the love with all your heart."

1489
01:36:57,711 --> 01:37:02,735
"She was in hurry and confused."

1490
01:37:02,785 --> 01:37:07,552
"Why so much tension for this heart?"

1491
01:37:07,602 --> 01:37:12,543
"Come on you see and bring the heat on."

1492
01:37:12,593 --> 01:37:16,600
"Vanish the distance
and let the band sound."

1493
01:37:16,650 --> 01:37:21,588
"Hey, say a great word
With open eyes this drenched night."

1494
01:37:21,638 --> 01:37:25,795
"I will watch all your angles like a feast."

1495
01:37:26,472 --> 01:37:31,390
"Come hand in hand with me for 100 years."

1496
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:35,781
"I will push your life into cloud nine."

1497
01:37:36,103 --> 01:37:41,960
"Oh Sitara, Sitara..
Oh, Sitara.."

1498
01:37:42,010 --> 01:37:45,587
"I was a vagabond before."

1499
01:37:57,541 --> 01:38:00,623
What were you doing idiots
when someone came and took away the girl?

1500
01:38:00,673 --> 01:38:01,719
What the hell are you doing?

1501
01:38:02,133 --> 01:38:03,011
Siddarth.

1502
01:38:03,061 --> 01:38:03,875
Wait.

1503
01:38:04,008 --> 01:38:05,276
They are not responsible for this.

1504
01:38:05,326 --> 01:38:08,676
Rajeev Reddy, this is not the way
to bring up a girl.

1505
01:38:09,573 --> 01:38:13,740
Yes, Grandpa.
I said yes for this bet as dad said.

1506
01:38:14,402 --> 01:38:15,857
If the girl eloped

1507
01:38:16,501 --> 01:38:17,652
What about our prestige now?

1508
01:38:17,702 --> 01:38:20,685
Yes, son had many hopes on this marriage?

1509
01:38:20,735 --> 01:38:23,502
Not just daughter but even the puppy jumps
over the wall when there is no control.

1510
01:38:23,552 --> 01:38:26,346
Still what prestige, sir,
when the girl eloped?

1511
01:38:26,396 --> 01:38:28,057
She didn't elope, I took her.

1512
01:38:36,328 --> 01:38:39,109
There is a lot of difference
between running away and taking.

1513
01:38:39,214 --> 01:38:40,601
I took her.

1514
01:38:41,127 --> 01:38:42,069
Sitara.

1515
01:38:50,135 --> 01:38:53,218
If you had given the freedom to your
daughter to say that there was a competition

1516
01:38:53,268 --> 01:38:54,737
It would not have happened so.

1517
01:38:56,103 --> 01:38:58,661
If you just get her married to someone
with more money than you

1518
01:38:58,711 --> 01:39:00,035
Your daughter will not be happy.

1519
01:39:00,570 --> 01:39:04,319
She feels happy only when you recognize
her goals and ambitions as a father.

1520
01:39:08,496 --> 01:39:11,489
Real victory for a dad
is the happiness of his daughter.

1521
01:39:13,756 --> 01:39:17,243
It is not to feed in time or get costly
dresses that mean to bring up kids sir.

1522
01:39:17,578 --> 01:39:19,489
It is about loving and understanding them.

1523
01:39:19,539 --> 01:39:23,287
It is to transform them in a way to win the
pains and troubles coming up in their lives.

1524
01:39:24,592 --> 01:39:25,878
Hey!

1525
01:39:26,354 --> 01:39:29,711
Who are you to preach us?

1526
01:39:29,761 --> 01:39:31,474
This is our personal matter.

1527
01:39:31,834 --> 01:39:33,729
She is to be daughter-in-law of our family.

1528
01:39:33,779 --> 01:39:34,971
No way, old man.

1529
01:39:35,021 --> 01:39:36,652
That would be decided for coming Derby cup

1530
01:39:36,702 --> 01:39:39,364
But, shall I tell one thing?
Love cannot stay where there is a doubt.

1531
01:39:39,461 --> 01:39:41,641
How can the girl be in a house without love?

1532
01:39:43,339 --> 01:39:45,045
A girl coming in as daughter-in-law

1533
01:39:45,082 --> 01:39:47,095
Should be with a courage
that nothing would happen to her.

1534
01:39:47,145 --> 01:39:48,900
And not with fear.

1535
01:40:17,432 --> 01:40:21,420
You are intrusive in all my deeds!

1536
01:40:21,470 --> 01:40:24,928
I very well know what you are
and what your life is!

1537
01:40:25,584 --> 01:40:29,062
From now, I will be as an obstacle
in every work you do and this is fixed.

1538
01:40:31,785 --> 01:40:35,243
Raising kids doesn't mean feeding them
or buying them costly dresses.

1539
01:40:35,527 --> 01:40:37,418
It is to love and understand them.

1540
01:40:37,556 --> 01:40:41,141
To prepare them to win over the adversities.

1541
01:40:43,588 --> 01:40:45,798
Lakshmi...
- What is it dad?

1542
01:40:45,848 --> 01:40:48,202
You had brought some application right,
bring it here.

1543
01:40:48,252 --> 01:40:49,452
What?

1544
01:40:49,502 --> 01:40:50,795
One minute.

1545
01:41:00,886 --> 01:41:03,574
You wanted to become a pilot, right?
Do what you like!

1546
01:41:04,206 --> 01:41:06,179
Thank you, Dad!

1547
01:41:09,918 --> 01:41:11,037
Sit down!

1548
01:41:11,969 --> 01:41:13,000
No!

1549
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:14,192
Hey Siddarth...

1550
01:41:14,693 --> 01:41:16,829
I somehow feel
that boy is correct for that girl.

1551
01:41:20,963 --> 01:41:24,787
He brought back the girl without marrying
after taking her from the house means

1552
01:41:24,837 --> 01:41:26,130
he really loves her.

1553
01:41:30,049 --> 01:41:33,390
You see his love, I see his plan dad!

1554
01:41:33,761 --> 01:41:35,994
Plan?
- Yes dad, it is a plan.

1555
01:41:36,376 --> 01:41:39,093
If they elope and marry...
they wouldn't get share in your property.

1556
01:41:39,143 --> 01:41:42,754
But if her father gets them married?
They will get crores of property!

1557
01:41:42,804 --> 01:41:44,176
So he brought her back.

1558
01:41:45,191 --> 01:41:48,838
If I was in his place,
I would not have brought her back.

1559
01:41:49,527 --> 01:41:53,455
You left crores of money for mom's love...
You are my inspiration.

1560
01:41:54,375 --> 01:41:57,046
He is not any normal fellow,
he has hit on the exact target!

1561
01:41:57,096 --> 01:41:59,143
The girl is important to me
than the property dad.

1562
01:42:05,997 --> 01:42:07,501
What does your son think?

1563
01:42:07,551 --> 01:42:10,230
Why do you find him right for the girl?
Am I a fool here?

1564
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:14,699
You are the reason for that.

1565
01:42:15,356 --> 01:42:16,850
I brought you here...

1566
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:20,329
to kill the love my son has for his son.

1567
01:42:20,737 --> 01:42:23,457
Doesn't mean you should become good
in his eyes.

1568
01:42:23,507 --> 01:42:26,992
What do I get to enact his son?

1569
01:42:27,042 --> 01:42:28,745
Is it Rs. 10 crores or Rs. 15 crores?

1570
01:42:29,106 --> 01:42:32,418
But if I marry her, I get Rs. 100 crores.
More than 100 crores is what I earn.

1571
01:42:32,948 --> 01:42:34,466
It's not about the money you give.

1572
01:42:34,868 --> 01:42:36,695
If required, I will give you in return.

1573
01:42:37,664 --> 01:42:39,402
He fell in his own ditch.

1574
01:42:39,452 --> 01:42:40,818
But I need that girl.

1575
01:42:40,996 --> 01:42:42,216
I want her!

1576
01:42:45,151 --> 01:42:46,721
You know me very well, right?

1577
01:42:47,024 --> 01:42:51,640
If I like something,
I could even kill someone to get it.

1578
01:42:52,183 --> 01:42:55,241
It may be either you or your son.

1579
01:42:55,291 --> 01:42:59,155
Don't show your rage to me,
but first handle the lover of that girl.

1580
01:43:02,173 --> 01:43:03,576
Sir, where have we come?

1581
01:43:18,619 --> 01:43:22,553
Padma, don't touch anything in this house.
Everything here is valuable to me.

1582
01:43:22,603 --> 01:43:25,213
This is a Salarjung Museum.

1583
01:43:25,263 --> 01:43:27,181
You don't want me to touch anything here?

1584
01:43:27,486 --> 01:43:28,700
It is way more important to me.

1585
01:43:29,026 --> 01:43:31,527
I was brought up in this house
during my childhood with mom and dad

1586
01:43:36,951 --> 01:43:39,070
(Footsteps approaching )

1587
01:44:21,818 --> 01:44:23,729
Have you finished him?

1588
01:45:20,485 --> 01:45:25,185
Hey... you can't kill me so easily...

1589
01:45:25,588 --> 01:45:28,422
I am a weapon and you will be dead.

1590
01:45:49,948 --> 01:45:52,137
Hey... Adi.

1591
01:45:52,687 --> 01:45:53,809
Shut up!

1592
01:45:53,859 --> 01:45:55,690
You duplicate!

1593
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:58,995
If a fox bears streaks on its body,
doesn't mean it can pretend to be a tiger!

1594
01:45:59,934 --> 01:46:01,301
I'm the tiger!

1595
01:46:01,663 --> 01:46:03,434
Do you know me?

1596
01:46:04,030 --> 01:46:05,539
Siddarth Reddy.

1597
01:46:05,589 --> 01:46:07,156
Son of Mahendra Reddy.

1598
01:46:07,501 --> 01:46:08,593
I'm the original.

1599
01:46:19,450 --> 01:46:20,935
Hey old man...

1600
01:46:21,805 --> 01:46:23,934
Have you gone dumb?

1601
01:46:23,984 --> 01:46:26,036
Has your heart stopped?

1602
01:46:29,012 --> 01:46:32,840
I didn't want to see your face,
but I had to see it.

1603
01:46:33,208 --> 01:46:37,415
I didn't want to step into your house...
But you made me do it.

1604
01:46:45,635 --> 01:46:48,177
I am speaking, right?
Can't you wait?

1605
01:46:55,034 --> 01:46:58,188
Once you separated me from my father...
I forgave you.

1606
01:46:58,238 --> 01:47:01,489
Now you are cheating dad
and I will not forgive.

1607
01:47:02,991 --> 01:47:06,873
I will make you run faster than a horse.
Be prepared.

1608
01:47:06,923 --> 01:47:07,800
Buzz off!

1609
01:47:08,270 --> 01:47:09,169
What are you talking about?

1610
01:47:09,219 --> 01:47:11,358
Will you make me run?

1611
01:47:11,408 --> 01:47:12,722
Kid!

1612
01:47:13,330 --> 01:47:14,919
Just by hitting a few goons...

1613
01:47:15,238 --> 01:47:16,508
Will you become a gangster?

1614
01:47:16,974 --> 01:47:18,574
Can you raise your voice and challenge me?

1615
01:47:18,868 --> 01:47:20,189
Will you become a hero?

1616
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:22,323
Yes, I am the hero.

1617
01:47:22,373 --> 01:47:24,944
I'm saying it with
the same confidence and ego.

1618
01:47:24,994 --> 01:47:28,965
There will be nothing like tampering dad
or pushing out of house like you.

1619
01:47:29,015 --> 01:47:32,454
Just one hit, I will win the race.

1620
01:47:32,504 --> 01:47:34,517
Won't happen.
- It will happen.

1621
01:47:34,567 --> 01:47:38,538
Then I'll fall on your fathers feet
and ask him for forgive me.

1622
01:47:39,422 --> 01:47:42,796
Will you go away forever
from your dad if you lose?

1623
01:47:48,227 --> 01:47:49,668
What happened?

1624
01:47:49,718 --> 01:47:52,462
Have you gone dumb
or has your heart stopped beating?

1625
01:47:54,091 --> 01:47:55,576
Come... come... come...

1626
01:47:56,148 --> 01:48:00,900
You will not get a better chance than this
to win your dad.

1627
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:04,189
Hey... will you agree to this challenge?

1628
01:48:05,166 --> 01:48:06,286
Don't accept.

1629
01:48:06,689 --> 01:48:09,557
This is not a child play...

1630
01:48:10,405 --> 01:48:12,141
It's a horse race.

1631
01:48:12,191 --> 01:48:14,803
I am ready!

1632
01:48:16,343 --> 01:48:19,594
I'll get on the same horse
which I didn't like.

1633
01:48:19,644 --> 01:48:22,843
The race I don't like, I will win that race.

1634
01:48:22,893 --> 01:48:25,501
I won the life with none beside me.

1635
01:48:25,551 --> 01:48:28,121
If my dad is going to be on my side...

1636
01:48:28,526 --> 01:48:30,247
I will fight with my life.

1637
01:48:31,718 --> 01:48:34,475
Same date, same time, same place

1638
01:48:34,525 --> 01:48:36,402
same track and the same race...

1639
01:48:36,452 --> 01:48:37,445
I am ready.

1640
01:48:39,295 --> 01:48:41,242
You or me!

1641
01:48:41,292 --> 01:48:43,539
Let us decide.

1642
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:52,946
Original blood is boiling there.

1643
01:48:53,255 --> 01:48:55,470
Whatever... original is always original!

1644
01:49:24,236 --> 01:49:26,249
Do you understand
what you did?

1645
01:49:26,878 --> 01:49:29,471
I dragged you into the challenge
when I was angry at you.

1646
01:49:29,694 --> 01:49:31,547
It was a mistake.

1647
01:49:32,128 --> 01:49:35,385
Now you've challenged them
about winning the game.

1648
01:49:35,838 --> 01:49:38,716
If you lose this game

1649
01:49:38,766 --> 01:49:41,171
Will you leave your dad forever?

1650
01:49:41,814 --> 01:49:42,680
Tell me!

1651
01:49:43,496 --> 01:49:44,968
You didn't think about this?

1652
01:49:46,435 --> 01:49:47,560
What to do?

1653
01:49:47,610 --> 01:49:50,718
I didn't think about anything but my dad!

1654
01:49:50,768 --> 01:49:53,333
I like my dad so much.
- How will you do it?

1655
01:49:53,612 --> 01:49:55,117
You can't ride a horse...

1656
01:49:55,167 --> 01:49:57,333
Did you run the moment you were born?
No...

1657
01:49:57,383 --> 01:49:59,712
You learnt. You fell down, got up
and then ran.

1658
01:49:59,762 --> 01:50:00,834
This is the same.

1659
01:50:00,884 --> 01:50:03,423
Like there is a master in market
to teach every subject

1660
01:50:03,473 --> 01:50:06,155
there will be a coach to teach every game.

1661
01:50:07,394 --> 01:50:11,050
But no one will come to your aid
if your grandpa and Adi form the opposition!

1662
01:50:11,365 --> 01:50:13,200
There is a guy!
- Who?

1663
01:50:13,250 --> 01:50:16,709
Who can ride any horse with one hand.
Mackenna's Gold.

1664
01:50:18,881 --> 01:50:23,013
He's been on the horse since his birth.
He was brought up on the horse itself.

1665
01:50:24,448 --> 01:50:26,685
He is the one and only Bahubali for horses.

1666
01:50:33,516 --> 01:50:37,293
Come...

1667
01:50:37,343 --> 01:50:38,728
Our destination has arrived.

1668
01:50:40,346 --> 01:50:42,573
Give me ten rupees.
- 10 rupees for just one round?

1669
01:50:42,623 --> 01:50:45,907
Do you want me to go around Vizag
for the 10 rupees you pay?

1670
01:50:45,957 --> 01:50:47,737
10 for kids and 25 for elders!

1671
01:50:47,787 --> 01:50:49,468
10 for kids and 25 for elders!

1672
01:50:49,518 --> 01:50:51,245
10 for kids and 25 for elders!

1673
01:50:53,154 --> 01:50:54,285
Will you ride the horse?

1674
01:50:54,855 --> 01:50:55,783
What?

1675
01:50:56,085 --> 01:50:57,984
Do I look like someone
who can ride the horse?

1676
01:50:58,034 --> 01:51:02,114
If you climb over the horse
you may go till there.

1677
01:51:02,164 --> 01:51:04,514
If the horse climbs over you,
you will be gone.

1678
01:51:04,564 --> 01:51:05,659
That is my horse.

1679
01:51:05,709 --> 01:51:07,658
He is talking too much!

1680
01:51:07,708 --> 01:51:08,633
What is your name?

1681
01:51:08,683 --> 01:51:09,891
Horseman Babu.

1682
01:51:10,254 --> 01:51:11,631
Horseman Babu?

1683
01:51:11,681 --> 01:51:14,461
Yes, my name is Babu
and this is my horse.

1684
01:51:14,511 --> 01:51:15,683
Horseman Babu.

1685
01:51:15,733 --> 01:51:17,371
Famous all over Vizag.
- Oh...

1686
01:51:17,421 --> 01:51:18,626
So famous?

1687
01:51:18,676 --> 01:51:20,650
Did you watch the film Bahubali?
- Yes, I've seen it.

1688
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:22,525
Did you see the war episode?
- Yes, I saw.

1689
01:51:22,686 --> 01:51:25,944
The horse which Prabhas rides...
- Is this the one? - No...

1690
01:51:25,994 --> 01:51:28,512
There was Rana right?
- Oh, Rana's horse, Rana's horse...

1691
01:51:29,305 --> 01:51:30,401
Yes, I understood now.

1692
01:51:30,451 --> 01:51:32,077
This is Kattappa's horse...

1693
01:51:32,127 --> 01:51:34,087
It's the same...
- Oh.. shit!

1694
01:51:34,610 --> 01:51:36,124
How many soldiers were there?

1695
01:51:36,174 --> 01:51:37,175
Around 10,000.

1696
01:51:37,225 --> 01:51:38,846
Ten thousand horses for ten thousand people!

1697
01:51:38,896 --> 01:51:41,094
The last one was mine.

1698
01:51:41,144 --> 01:51:42,541
Rajamouli's selection.

1699
01:51:44,142 --> 01:51:45,811
Do you know Sweety?
- Anushka, right

1700
01:51:46,337 --> 01:51:48,696
She loves me and my horse a lot.

1701
01:51:48,746 --> 01:51:50,364
We need this idiot.

1702
01:51:50,420 --> 01:51:52,021
Let's take him...
- Where, to your house?

1703
01:51:52,071 --> 01:51:53,945
For Bahubali 3 shooting...

1704
01:51:53,995 --> 01:51:56,240
Two is not released yet
and why does this fool say three?

1705
01:51:56,290 --> 01:51:57,121
Fool?

1706
01:51:57,171 --> 01:51:59,015
Drag him in to the vehicle...

1707
01:51:59,826 --> 01:52:02,595
Oh no...

1708
01:52:02,792 --> 01:52:04,210
Why are they so many horses here?

1709
01:52:04,499 --> 01:52:07,497
Who are you people?
- I was telling you about him.

1710
01:52:07,656 --> 01:52:10,726
There is no better waste fellow than him
in entire South India in dealing the horses.

1711
01:52:10,776 --> 01:52:13,076
Hey Ongole, who is the waste fellow?

1712
01:52:13,126 --> 01:52:15,766
Ask in Vizag, they will tell you
about my monthly income.

1713
01:52:15,816 --> 01:52:17,836
I'm the brand Ambassador of Visakha beach.

1714
01:52:17,886 --> 01:52:19,865
Hey...
- Sir that is...

1715
01:52:19,915 --> 01:52:22,373
Vuda park in the morning,
Maddilapalem in the noon,

1716
01:52:22,423 --> 01:52:26,233
Seethammadhara in the evening
and Ramakrishna beach in the night sir.

1717
01:52:26,283 --> 01:52:27,034
Full busy!

1718
01:52:27,084 --> 01:52:29,596
How much do you earn in a day?
- How many times should I say sir?

1719
01:52:29,646 --> 01:52:32,581
10 for kids and 25 for the elders
and free for aged like you.

1720
01:52:32,631 --> 01:52:34,724
Oh no, why is this old man so strong?

1721
01:52:34,774 --> 01:52:38,017
I mean, free for senior citizen like you.

1722
01:52:38,067 --> 01:52:39,585
Why did you bring me here?

1723
01:52:39,635 --> 01:52:41,369
You should go as a coach for one man.

1724
01:52:41,545 --> 01:52:42,995
I will pay a lakh per day.

1725
01:52:43,666 --> 01:52:45,265
A lakh?

1726
01:52:45,315 --> 01:52:46,900
Coach?

1727
01:52:47,034 --> 01:52:49,628
Coaching means to teach
what I know, right?

1728
01:52:49,678 --> 01:52:52,021
You should not teach him anything.

1729
01:52:52,071 --> 01:52:54,448
He should know to teach him, right?

1730
01:52:54,842 --> 01:52:56,058
Hey.
- Sir?

1731
01:52:56,108 --> 01:52:56,961
What is your name?

1732
01:52:57,011 --> 01:52:58,571
Horseman Babu.

1733
01:52:58,621 --> 01:53:01,190
Your name from today is not Horseman Babu.

1734
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:03,421
Peter Heins
- Peter Heins?

1735
01:53:03,471 --> 01:53:04,303
I don't like that name.

1736
01:53:04,779 --> 01:53:08,137
No sir, Peter Heins!
That name is so good.

1737
01:53:08,187 --> 01:53:10,269
I should get into his place, right?

1738
01:53:10,319 --> 01:53:12,271
Where is the original Peter Heins, sir?

1739
01:53:12,321 --> 01:53:14,133
He is that original Peter Heins.

1740
01:53:14,663 --> 01:53:15,571
What is that?

1741
01:53:15,621 --> 01:53:18,779
When we are discussing so seriously,
why is he resting thereunder the tree?

1742
01:53:18,829 --> 01:53:20,812
He is not taking rest,
but we killed him.

1743
01:53:24,589 --> 01:53:26,179
Don't get surprised, we had killed him.

1744
01:53:26,229 --> 01:53:27,244
You killed him?

1745
01:53:28,191 --> 01:53:31,046
If anything goes wrong,
we would kill you too

1746
01:53:31,096 --> 01:53:33,470
Who would feed my horse if I die?

1747
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:34,904
Who is my student sir?

1748
01:53:40,008 --> 01:53:41,125
Siddhu...
- Ha..

1749
01:53:42,115 --> 01:53:44,746
My dad agreed for you to practice here.

1750
01:53:45,088 --> 01:53:47,362
Select a horse you like from these.

1751
01:53:52,423 --> 01:53:53,255
That horse!

1752
01:53:57,642 --> 01:54:00,339
That one?
It is the most powerful horse we have?

1753
01:54:00,709 --> 01:54:02,799
Taming that horse is very difficult, Siddhu

1754
01:54:02,849 --> 01:54:04,641
Yes sir, it looks so wild.

1755
01:54:04,691 --> 01:54:06,592
You have never been with a horse...

1756
01:54:06,642 --> 01:54:07,447
That's okay...

1757
01:54:07,849 --> 01:54:09,864
Our coach Peter Heins would come today?
- Yes sir.

1758
01:54:09,914 --> 01:54:12,746
Do you know how does he look?
- I've heard of him but never saw him sir.

1759
01:54:12,796 --> 01:54:14,662
Actually, I too am very excited.

1760
01:54:15,122 --> 01:54:17,483
Call him once...
- Hey, no need.

1761
01:54:17,533 --> 01:54:19,030
There... he is coming.

1762
01:54:33,537 --> 01:54:34,762
Come on, both of you give ten each.

1763
01:54:34,812 --> 01:54:35,993
Go and play now...

1764
01:54:38,939 --> 01:54:40,717
Peter Heins?
- Ya.

1765
01:54:40,767 --> 01:54:42,254
Single man Peter Heins.

1766
01:54:42,598 --> 01:54:44,426
Why did the kids sit on the horse?

1767
01:54:44,476 --> 01:54:47,414
They wanted to and I made them happy.

1768
01:54:47,464 --> 01:54:49,448
You also took some change from them, right?

1769
01:54:49,498 --> 01:54:50,720
No change for 2000 bucks.

1770
01:54:50,770 --> 01:54:52,684
To feed the horse,
I took 20 rupees from them.

1771
01:54:52,734 --> 01:54:54,171
It's not so convincing!

1772
01:54:54,221 --> 01:54:55,390
Do they know about me?

1773
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:58,813
We should not try any work we don't know.
We should not do any work we know for free.

1774
01:54:58,863 --> 01:55:01,209
That is my policy.
Are you my student?

1775
01:55:01,259 --> 01:55:03,143
Not him but me.

1776
01:55:03,193 --> 01:55:04,020
You?

1777
01:55:04,795 --> 01:55:05,702
Come here.

1778
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:09,501
Do you know why I hit you?

1779
01:55:09,948 --> 01:55:11,360
I have a bit of frustration.

1780
01:55:11,410 --> 01:55:14,854
I don't hesitate to murder
if the work is not done.

1781
01:55:20,094 --> 01:55:21,888
Who is this figure?
- His lover.

1782
01:55:21,938 --> 01:55:24,467
Bet was made for her
and you were called in as the coach.

1783
01:55:25,858 --> 01:55:27,239
She looks like the Arabian horse.

1784
01:55:27,289 --> 01:55:30,204
Just a bet for this figure,
one can even die at a war for her.

1785
01:55:30,254 --> 01:55:31,598
Oh... okay...

1786
01:55:31,648 --> 01:55:32,907
What do you know about a horse?

1787
01:55:32,957 --> 01:55:36,048
Basically, a horse has four legs
and runs very fast.

1788
01:55:36,098 --> 01:55:38,086
Sir, it also has two eyes.
- Yes, it has two eyes too

1789
01:55:38,136 --> 01:55:39,440
Will it have two eyes?

1790
01:55:39,490 --> 01:55:40,996
Looks like you forgot another item!

1791
01:55:41,046 --> 01:55:42,040
Yes, that is...

1792
01:55:42,444 --> 01:55:44,186
The tail...
- Yes, it has a tail too

1793
01:55:44,236 --> 01:55:47,732
It has a tail, it raises it,
it gives dung, it urinates... Not this idiot

1794
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:50,337
Horse means an ego and power.

1795
01:55:50,387 --> 01:55:52,783
That is why they compare stamina
with horse power.

1796
01:55:52,833 --> 01:55:54,690
I think, sir knows well about horses.
- Very much.

1797
01:55:54,740 --> 01:55:57,191
You should ask in Vizag beach
about my knowledge on horses.

1798
01:55:57,241 --> 01:55:58,287
Beach?

1799
01:55:59,285 --> 01:56:01,042
I said beach instead of coach.

1800
01:56:01,313 --> 01:56:02,897
Training starts from tomorrow...
- I'm ready.

1801
01:56:02,947 --> 01:56:04,504
Training means not like this.

1802
01:56:08,461 --> 01:56:09,502
All the best!

1803
01:56:15,365 --> 01:56:16,367
Sir...

1804
01:56:16,934 --> 01:56:18,709
What?
- Ok.. ok...

1805
01:56:19,876 --> 01:56:21,035
As if I don't know!

1806
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:27,345
I'm seeing from four days he is making
rounds but he is not starting the training.

1807
01:56:27,395 --> 01:56:29,463
For reasons, I have doubt on him.

1808
01:56:29,513 --> 01:56:32,847
He is Peter Heins.
He is a horse whisperer.

1809
01:56:33,117 --> 01:56:35,543
Sun is very bright...
Wonder if there're customers on the beach.

1810
01:56:35,593 --> 01:56:36,435
What beach?

1811
01:56:36,485 --> 01:56:39,781
Not beach, body language!

1812
01:56:39,831 --> 01:56:41,666
I'm testing your body language
on the horse.

1813
01:56:41,716 --> 01:56:43,303
Sir, how long will we ride like this?

1814
01:56:43,353 --> 01:56:46,087
Why are you questioning the coach?
- I mean...

1815
01:56:46,137 --> 01:56:47,278
Don't irritate me.
- Sir.

1816
01:56:47,328 --> 01:56:49,556
Yes What?
- I have no range to ask you...

1817
01:56:49,606 --> 01:56:51,796
I know... ask me.
- Why are you riding him like that?

1818
01:56:51,846 --> 01:56:54,704
Horse riding means,
getting to know the horse, firstly.

1819
01:56:54,754 --> 01:56:57,353
We should get warmed up
and warm this up.

1820
01:57:00,078 --> 01:57:01,069
Look...

1821
01:57:01,214 --> 01:57:02,417
How I will tame that horse?

1822
01:57:02,467 --> 01:57:03,324
Sir...
- Yes?

1823
01:57:03,374 --> 01:57:04,346
That is a wild horse...

1824
01:57:04,510 --> 01:57:06,127
No one could tame it till now!

1825
01:57:06,177 --> 01:57:07,662
Wild or my foot!

1826
01:57:07,972 --> 01:57:10,818
I have seen many wilds as such.

1827
01:57:10,868 --> 01:57:13,514
See the magic of Peter Heins now.

1828
01:57:14,989 --> 01:57:17,266
Look into my eyes...

1829
01:57:19,294 --> 01:57:20,243
Yes...

1830
01:57:29,170 --> 01:57:32,480
Are you Pawan Kalyan
to control an horse with eyes?

1831
01:57:32,530 --> 01:57:34,911
Hey, stop throwing the dialogues
and give your hand!

1832
01:57:36,221 --> 01:57:38,223
Have I not said it is difficult?

1833
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:39,907
Maybe all such things
are common in friendship.

1834
01:57:39,957 --> 01:57:41,155
Will you go for another trial?

1835
01:57:41,205 --> 01:57:43,063
Looks like it has no faith in friendship.

1836
01:57:43,113 --> 01:57:44,947
Horse is not in good mood,
so am I...

1837
01:57:44,997 --> 01:57:46,405
I will try next time.

1838
01:57:46,455 --> 01:57:47,547
Help me till there...

1839
01:58:03,862 --> 01:58:05,424
How is it dad?

1840
01:58:05,474 --> 01:58:07,063
You lost by 16 seconds.

1841
01:58:07,113 --> 01:58:08,484
That is a record.
- That means...

1842
01:58:08,814 --> 01:58:11,261
I should finish ride in 1 minute 22 seconds?
- Yes.

1843
01:58:11,311 --> 01:58:13,837
Impossible, no one can do that dad.
What are you saying?

1844
01:58:13,887 --> 01:58:14,707
Correct.

1845
01:58:15,024 --> 01:58:17,676
That was the feat no one can do
other than your dad.

1846
01:58:17,726 --> 01:58:19,581
No, I don't believe this.

1847
01:58:19,631 --> 01:58:21,926
No way...
- Show it to him once...

1848
01:58:21,976 --> 01:58:23,889
Wait dad, that was long back,
about 25 years ago.

1849
01:58:23,939 --> 01:58:25,742
Dad has aged, Grandpa!

1850
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:27,639
Let it go!
It's ok, you can't do it.

1851
01:58:27,689 --> 01:58:28,948
Wait, he will do it.

1852
01:58:46,155 --> 01:58:49,889
One minute 22 seconds, I can't believe it.
How did you do that, Dad?

1853
01:58:49,939 --> 01:58:52,800
You can have confidence
but not over confidence.

1854
01:58:53,389 --> 01:58:55,758
Everyone on the track desires to win,

1855
01:58:55,808 --> 01:58:57,705
but you should have something
more than him in you!

1856
01:58:57,755 --> 01:58:59,081
Only then victory becomes yours.

1857
01:59:00,819 --> 01:59:03,313
Hey, you know how important
this race is for me?

1858
01:59:03,363 --> 01:59:04,496
Please cooperate a bit.

1859
01:59:04,546 --> 01:59:07,610
If I win this race, I will set up honeymoon
with an Australian breed for you.

1860
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:09,148
For sure.
- Wow...

1861
01:59:09,198 --> 01:59:12,203
As far as I know none would have given
a better deal for a horse sir.

1862
01:59:12,807 --> 01:59:14,943
You are something I tell you...
- Yes, right?

1863
01:59:14,993 --> 01:59:18,283
Why did you keep a meeting
so early in the morning?

1864
01:59:18,333 --> 01:59:20,740
Waiting for you, sir.
- Why are you over-acting?

1865
01:59:20,790 --> 01:59:21,784
It's not over-action, sir.

1866
01:59:21,834 --> 01:59:24,262
I know I am not of a range to ask...
But I have a small request, sir.

1867
01:59:24,312 --> 01:59:26,662
Ask...
- I want to see you climbing over the horse.

1868
01:59:26,712 --> 01:59:27,525
What is this?

1869
01:59:28,206 --> 01:59:30,089
Mission Impossible 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

1870
01:59:30,139 --> 01:59:32,064
Your wish will never be fulfilled.
- But why, sir?

1871
01:59:32,114 --> 01:59:33,954
Do you think
coach means a railway coach, Coach?

1872
01:59:34,004 --> 01:59:35,705
To come on to the platform
once the whistle is blown?

1873
01:59:35,755 --> 01:59:37,175
Coach!
What did I say?

1874
01:59:37,225 --> 01:59:39,466
Coach.

1875
01:59:39,645 --> 01:59:40,799
Come...

1876
01:59:42,017 --> 01:59:43,040
We shall practice.

1877
01:59:43,921 --> 01:59:45,774
Siddhu, one minute

1878
01:59:46,648 --> 01:59:48,115
Many thanks, Brother.

1879
01:59:48,576 --> 01:59:49,404
Brother?

1880
01:59:49,454 --> 01:59:50,697
Mahendra Reddy's daughter...

1881
01:59:50,747 --> 01:59:53,031
She wants to meet you.
So I brought her here.

1882
01:59:53,081 --> 01:59:57,321
That day after you brought her home,
your words changed dad a lot.

1883
01:59:58,604 --> 02:00:02,886
Dad didn't agree from two years,
but now he agreed for my pilot training.

1884
02:00:02,936 --> 02:00:04,538
I am so happy!

1885
02:00:04,588 --> 02:00:06,328
What is your name, dear?
- Lakshmi!

1886
02:00:06,888 --> 02:00:08,020
Mother's name.

1887
02:00:08,747 --> 02:00:10,479
Does it sound too old?

1888
02:00:11,269 --> 02:00:13,103
That is the name of my dad's first love.

1889
02:00:13,494 --> 02:00:14,452
How do you know?

1890
02:00:14,502 --> 02:00:17,764
It seems dad said the whole love story
to mom before marriage.

1891
02:00:17,814 --> 02:00:19,565
That is a big story, Brother.

1892
02:00:20,405 --> 02:00:21,951
He must be knowing all the stories...

1893
02:00:22,001 --> 02:00:24,185
I'll see you then, Brother.
- Bye.

1894
02:00:25,535 --> 02:00:26,387
Lakshmi...

1895
02:00:34,116 --> 02:00:34,924
No brother...

1896
02:00:34,974 --> 02:00:38,376
You have name of mom, called me brother
and won't take when brother is giving?

1897
02:00:45,016 --> 02:00:45,835
Thanks, Brother...

1898
02:00:45,885 --> 02:00:48,660
Come fast horse is waiting...

1899
02:00:48,710 --> 02:00:50,025
What is he doing here?

1900
02:00:50,075 --> 02:00:50,997
He is my coach.

1901
02:00:51,047 --> 02:00:52,355
Do you know him?
- Coach?

1902
02:00:52,405 --> 02:00:53,984
He works for my brother...

1903
02:00:56,691 --> 02:00:59,470
- Welcome sir...
- Cake cutting for just this much training?

1904
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,090
Silly fellows!
Sit.

1905
02:01:01,814 --> 02:01:02,744
Where is the knife?

1906
02:01:02,794 --> 02:01:04,247
Sir, do you think this is a cake?

1907
02:01:04,297 --> 02:01:06,594
No sir, this is a mini race course

1908
02:01:06,644 --> 02:01:09,202
Oh, I see. This is grass
and these are the horses.

1909
02:01:09,252 --> 02:01:10,129
They are jockeys.

1910
02:01:10,438 --> 02:01:12,974
As a coach, what is your strategy, sir?

1911
02:01:13,526 --> 02:01:14,994
I will be caught
if I don't say something.

1912
02:01:15,614 --> 02:01:18,494
I am a specialist in planning.

1913
02:01:18,544 --> 02:01:20,419
First horse should be blinded.

1914
02:01:20,469 --> 02:01:22,184
Our sight should become its sight.

1915
02:01:22,234 --> 02:01:23,415
We should ride cross ways.

1916
02:01:23,465 --> 02:01:26,022
We should not know the path...
Horse should not know at all.

1917
02:01:26,619 --> 02:01:28,064
Balaiah said the same in 'Sathakarni' film!

1918
02:01:28,114 --> 02:01:29,425
It was me who told Balaiah.

1919
02:01:29,475 --> 02:01:31,674
Copyrights are mine.
I swear on the Vizag beach.

1920
02:01:31,724 --> 02:01:34,544
Yes, you keep swearing
on Vizag beach for every statement, sir.

1921
02:01:34,594 --> 02:01:36,816
What is your link to Vizag beach, sir?

1922
02:01:36,866 --> 02:01:37,842
No idea...

1923
02:01:37,892 --> 02:01:40,932
Taking the name of Vizag beach
my body gets vibrations.

1924
02:01:40,982 --> 02:01:42,728
Did you ever ride
an horse on the vizag beach?

1925
02:01:42,778 --> 02:01:45,607
Yes long back, sir.
It was two rupees then.

1926
02:01:45,657 --> 02:01:46,726
It's 25 rupees now!

1927
02:01:46,751 --> 02:01:48,746
Correct sir.
There were one or two those days

1928
02:01:48,796 --> 02:01:50,953
but now there are almost 40 horses.
- 40 horses?

1929
02:01:51,003 --> 02:01:52,411
Ya. - Who kept the horses
without my knowledge?

1930
02:01:52,626 --> 02:01:55,025
I got the tender from RK beach to VUDA Park.

1931
02:01:55,075 --> 02:01:56,230
What?

1932
02:01:56,280 --> 02:01:57,826
Tender.

1933
02:01:58,628 --> 02:02:03,131
"Hey flower to be diminishing,
why do you need these tunes?"

1934
02:02:03,181 --> 02:02:04,466
This is it, right?
- Yes, a similar one

1935
02:02:04,516 --> 02:02:06,802
Horseman Babu...
Get up...

1936
02:02:06,852 --> 02:02:11,009
You also know my name.
- We asked everything about you in RK beach.

1937
02:02:14,022 --> 02:02:16,002
I will tell you everything.

1938
02:02:19,950 --> 02:02:21,120
That is what happened...

1939
02:02:21,603 --> 02:02:22,869
He booked me so.

1940
02:02:23,142 --> 02:02:25,086
I will do whatever you say from now.

1941
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:27,445
Have some tea...

1942
02:02:28,183 --> 02:02:30,308
Now we know
that our only coach is an idiot...

1943
02:02:30,859 --> 02:02:32,948
We need to cut his hair first.

1944
02:02:33,365 --> 02:02:35,421
I'll cut it...
- Peter Heins...

1945
02:02:35,461 --> 02:02:37,171
A coach?
Damn you!

1946
02:02:38,067 --> 02:02:40,192
Now what about your training?

1947
02:02:40,358 --> 02:02:42,567
Why do you say that?
Coach doesn't mean only this fool...

1948
02:02:42,650 --> 02:02:43,650
If not him...
Then someone else...

1949
02:02:44,192 --> 02:02:45,942
No Padma...
He is my coach.

1950
02:02:46,567 --> 02:02:49,692
This horseman babu
alias Peter Heins is my coach...

1951
02:02:50,567 --> 02:02:52,317
How can you train with him?
He doesn't know anything...

1952
02:02:52,983 --> 02:02:54,192
Hey!
- I know this...

1953
02:02:54,692 --> 02:02:56,400
I'll tell if you stop swinging...

1954
02:02:56,942 --> 02:02:59,900
They think that he is training me
and he will train me.

1955
02:03:00,192 --> 02:03:01,900
But my training will not happen here...

1956
02:03:05,650 --> 02:03:07,233
Come on...
Come on boys...

1957
02:03:07,358 --> 02:03:09,108
Waste of time...
Let's start training...

1958
02:03:09,192 --> 02:03:10,608
Yes, sir...
- Climb on the horse.

1959
02:03:12,442 --> 02:03:13,858
Bless me, sir...
- What is this?

1960
02:03:17,025 --> 02:03:18,317
Siddhu...

1961
02:03:21,877 --> 02:03:23,942
Careful.
- Hey, stupid fellow...

1962
02:03:24,442 --> 02:03:27,067
You should climb the horse from behind...

1963
02:03:27,692 --> 02:03:29,192
How can he climb the horse from behind?

1964
02:03:29,275 --> 02:03:32,317
It doesn't matter how you climb the horse...
But you should get on the horse.

1965
02:03:32,358 --> 02:03:34,733
As a coach you can suggest
an easy method...

1966
02:03:34,758 --> 02:03:36,893
Like a...?

1967
02:03:37,067 --> 02:03:39,108
Hey, lift that pipe a bit.

1968
02:03:40,442 --> 02:03:41,817
Come here.
- Sir?

1969
02:03:42,483 --> 02:03:43,942
Do you want an easy method?
- Yes sir.

1970
02:03:44,025 --> 02:03:45,108
Do you see the pipe?
- Yes.

1971
02:03:45,150 --> 02:03:46,442
Hold on to it.
- Ok.

1972
02:03:46,567 --> 02:03:48,275
Jump at once when the horse comes onto it.

1973
02:03:48,567 --> 02:03:49,692
Sir, when is the horse coming?

1974
02:03:49,733 --> 02:03:51,900
Find out...
- Ok sir...

1975
02:03:53,150 --> 02:03:54,900
Don't follow his instructions...
He might kill you.

1976
02:03:54,983 --> 02:03:56,942
What are you talking?
I'm Peter Heins...

1977
02:03:56,983 --> 02:03:58,608
I can make the horse do pushups...

1978
02:03:58,692 --> 02:04:01,108
How is it possible?
You sound like a crazy guy.

1979
02:04:01,150 --> 02:04:03,525
Comedy with Peter Heins?
- I'll squeeze you.

1980
02:04:03,608 --> 02:04:07,025
Horses are scared of Peter Heins...

1981
02:04:07,692 --> 02:04:09,900
Paddu, why is that horse so dull?
- Yes, sir

1982
02:04:09,983 --> 02:04:12,233
I asked you to bring Ozomen, did you bring?
- Yes, sir.

1983
02:04:12,358 --> 02:04:14,275
Drop two pills in its throat...

1984
02:04:14,733 --> 02:04:18,025
Humans take Ozomen but not horses...
This is too much.

1985
02:04:18,067 --> 02:04:19,111
Give me...

1986
02:04:19,775 --> 02:04:21,233
What is this?
- Images of a horse.

1987
02:04:21,317 --> 02:04:22,692
Why did they use it?
- To say horse power, sir.

1988
02:04:22,775 --> 02:04:26,567
They try on humans
only after trying on the horses...

1989
02:04:26,692 --> 02:04:27,568
Did you get it?

1990
02:04:27,608 --> 02:04:28,942
Give her some pills.

1991
02:04:28,983 --> 02:04:30,650
Then see how it runs.

1992
02:04:31,942 --> 02:04:33,775
Yes, he is coming.
Control, baby.

1993
02:04:33,858 --> 02:04:35,442
Yes?
- Oh no...

1994
02:04:36,317 --> 02:04:37,775
Who are you and why are you irritating me?

1995
02:04:37,817 --> 02:04:39,400
I am Heins...
Peter Heins.

1996
02:04:39,442 --> 02:04:41,400
Super fantastic coach in India.

1997
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:43,361
Stop.

1998
02:04:43,775 --> 02:04:45,650
Is that Thoroughbred or Quarter horse
or an Arabian horse?

1999
02:04:45,692 --> 02:04:48,025
What does that mean?
- Are the muscle structures type one or two?

2000
02:04:48,108 --> 02:04:49,858
They said my sugar level is 2.

2001
02:04:49,942 --> 02:04:51,483
Do you know 'Sire and Dam' details?

2002
02:04:51,608 --> 02:04:52,983
Which breed?
- Breed?

2003
02:04:53,233 --> 02:04:56,483
I know bread, siren
and Nagarjuna Sagar Dam.

2004
02:04:56,525 --> 02:04:59,233
No idea about horse breed,
don't know that 'Sire' is the father.

2005
02:04:59,275 --> 02:05:01,400
You don't know 'Dam' means mother.
- How can you be a coach.

2006
02:05:01,525 --> 02:05:04,192
You couldn't find a better coach
than this idiot?

2007
02:05:04,233 --> 02:05:07,150
Who would go against your family
and train me?

2008
02:05:07,233 --> 02:05:09,775
Change him and take training
from a good coach

2009
02:05:09,942 --> 02:05:12,192
Sir, why don't you train me?

2010
02:05:16,858 --> 02:05:18,483
Why will I train you?

2011
02:05:18,525 --> 02:05:21,650
Do you fear that your son will lose
if you give train me?

2012
02:05:22,817 --> 02:05:25,150
Victory is within our blood.
- Correct.

2013
02:05:25,233 --> 02:05:27,067
Your blood will win.

2014
02:05:27,317 --> 02:05:30,692
Ok, let's just assume that
your blood will only win.

2015
02:05:30,817 --> 02:05:32,525
Why don't you train me?

2016
02:05:34,108 --> 02:05:35,317
Ok, I'll train you.
- Sir.

2017
02:05:35,442 --> 02:05:39,858
I don't like my son to win over a guy
who can't climb over a horse.

2018
02:05:40,233 --> 02:05:41,317
But, one condition.

2019
02:05:41,733 --> 02:05:42,692
What is it?

2020
02:05:42,983 --> 02:05:44,733
You should tame that horse.

2021
02:05:46,358 --> 02:05:47,442
Get lost!

2022
02:07:02,107 --> 02:07:04,150
Your training starts from today.

2023
02:07:45,983 --> 02:07:50,775
"Che guvera... you raise up!"

2024
02:07:51,317 --> 02:07:56,108
"Never looking back power in you
is your strength."

2025
02:07:56,567 --> 02:08:01,233
"Sail opposite not bowing your head."

2026
02:08:01,858 --> 02:08:06,608
"Win the troubles over with interest."

2027
02:08:06,858 --> 02:08:12,025
"Every step is a war
and your confidence is your support."

2028
02:08:12,347 --> 02:08:17,108
"Never let down
an opportunity at any moment."

2029
02:08:17,673 --> 02:08:22,483
"There is no goal bowing down
when you fight."

2030
02:08:22,836 --> 02:08:27,791
"Chase the dreams
making every cell as a weapon."

2031
02:08:27,816 --> 02:08:30,692
"Fight as you lose nothing,
you have no alternative."

2032
02:08:30,900 --> 02:08:32,983
"Aim with all your heart."

2033
02:08:33,190 --> 02:08:35,900
"Nothing is impossible for you,
console the bitterness."

2034
02:08:36,025 --> 02:08:38,608
"You are the winner"

2035
02:08:49,358 --> 02:08:54,317
"Precious Rama had
so many days of forest life."

2036
02:08:54,608 --> 02:08:59,397
"Has the golden opportunity
slipped from the hands in childhood?"

2037
02:09:00,067 --> 02:09:04,942
"Your hard work is being observed
by the mother sky."

2038
02:09:05,233 --> 02:09:10,108
"Has it sent the success to accompany you?"

2039
02:09:10,192 --> 02:09:15,317
"Every turn seems like the enemy
which is your close pal."

2040
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:20,567
"Every call is
the reflection of your power."

2041
02:09:20,957 --> 02:09:25,858
"The hurdle frightening you
is the chance of victory."

2042
02:09:26,090 --> 02:09:30,900
"The disturbance is the garland
giving you happiness tomorrow."

2043
02:09:31,108 --> 02:09:33,983
"Fight as you have nothing to lose,
you have no alternative."

2044
02:09:34,233 --> 02:09:36,275
"Come on... aim with all your heart."

2045
02:09:36,398 --> 02:09:39,233
"Nothing is impossible for you,
console the bitterness."

2046
02:09:39,358 --> 02:09:41,983
'"You are the winner."

2047
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:11,942
Thanks Adi...
You've sent the right coach on time!

2048
02:10:12,317 --> 02:10:16,317
It would have been very difficult
for me to face opponents like him.

2049
02:10:16,358 --> 02:10:17,400
I don't know anything.

2050
02:10:18,025 --> 02:10:19,983
Hey, Grandpa!
Original is ready!

2051
02:10:20,067 --> 02:10:21,692
Is your duplicate ready?

2052
02:10:23,608 --> 02:10:27,942
You want to win the race for money
and I want to win for relation.

2053
02:10:27,983 --> 02:10:30,025
We'll know about it
in the next 24 hours.

2054
02:10:30,192 --> 02:10:31,900
Either money or the relation?

2055
02:10:32,817 --> 02:10:35,858
Grandpa, practice touching feet...

2056
02:10:37,442 --> 02:10:38,775
A sweet warning.

2057
02:10:55,233 --> 02:10:56,317
Waste fellow...

2058
02:10:56,483 --> 02:10:59,192
I told you not to teach him anything
and he is ready for the race now.

2059
02:10:59,275 --> 02:11:02,025
Come on sir, I don't know to climb,
how can I teach him?

2060
02:11:02,108 --> 02:11:04,942
I can live with a horse on the Vizag beach,
if I am alive.

2061
02:11:05,025 --> 02:11:07,275
I neither need you nor your money,
keep that to yourself.

2062
02:11:07,608 --> 02:11:09,858
Who gave him training, Grandpa?

2063
02:11:09,942 --> 02:11:10,775
I trained him.

2064
02:11:13,733 --> 02:11:16,067
Dad, you...

2065
02:11:16,525 --> 02:11:19,025
Yes, I trained him.

2066
02:11:19,442 --> 02:11:22,817
Winning on a guy who knows nothing
about a horse and my son to marry a girl

2067
02:11:23,358 --> 02:11:24,608
it's an insult for this Mahendar Reddy.

2068
02:11:24,692 --> 02:11:25,650
Not that Dad!

2069
02:11:25,900 --> 02:11:27,775
Why did you teach him?
I don't understand.

2070
02:11:27,858 --> 02:11:29,317
Why are you tensed?

2071
02:11:29,733 --> 02:11:33,067
Any game should have equal opponent,
entertainment comes only then.

2072
02:11:33,525 --> 02:11:35,317
Remember one thing.

2073
02:11:35,608 --> 02:11:38,192
Victory is in our blood.
All the best!

2074
02:11:41,108 --> 02:11:42,110
Sir...

2075
02:11:42,608 --> 02:11:43,900
Sir...

2076
02:11:44,192 --> 02:11:46,358
When he said victory is in our blood,

2077
02:11:46,608 --> 02:11:49,608
Did he mean that you will win or him?

2078
02:11:50,929 --> 02:11:54,983
Whatever blood he has in him,
I have a thousand ways to win.

2079
02:11:55,483 --> 02:11:59,525
I learnt riding a horse only after learning
to destroy the one going ahead.

2080
02:12:01,775 --> 02:12:06,108
Whatever he strives, it is him.
Who will win and get that girl.

2081
02:12:20,442 --> 02:12:23,858
"I will give my B C centers in writing."

2082
02:12:24,025 --> 02:12:27,733
"I will put a tent in your A center."

2083
02:12:34,817 --> 02:12:38,233
"I will give my B C centers in writing."

2084
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:42,108
"I will put a tent in your A center."

2085
02:12:42,150 --> 02:12:49,358
"I will put a show for you in my theater,
I will show how mass is my love."

2086
02:12:49,650 --> 02:12:56,650
"I will come and propose you.
I'll give you Overseas rights in writing."

2087
02:12:56,817 --> 02:13:03,775
"I will put your cut-out in my heart.
I will whistle saying you are my hero."

2088
02:13:46,900 --> 02:13:50,525
"Your eyes are sparkling.
My heart is shocked"

2089
02:13:50,692 --> 02:13:53,983
"Lovely Fidel is in your waist."

2090
02:13:54,233 --> 02:13:57,692
"My heart is out
after placing the kerchief."

2091
02:13:57,817 --> 02:14:01,525
"Maybe people around us
would watch our romance."

2092
02:14:01,733 --> 02:14:08,858
"Let them see and laugh,
everyone does the same thing at this age."

2093
02:14:08,983 --> 02:14:15,858
"Let it go on says the queen."

2094
02:15:13,483 --> 02:15:20,733
"Your anklets are my relatives.
Your swinging beauties are like the kites."

2095
02:15:20,858 --> 02:15:24,358
"Your young beauties and that behavior"

2096
02:15:24,483 --> 02:15:28,150
"are stealing away my sleep"

2097
02:15:28,358 --> 02:15:35,442
"Where would be the food and sleep dear,
after the love is born?"

2098
02:15:35,608 --> 02:15:39,192
"Come on then,
we shall have a fight in the hug."

2099
02:15:39,233 --> 02:15:42,900
"We shall forget sleep till it happens."

2100
02:16:11,358 --> 02:16:12,817
All the best to both of us.
- Thank you.

2101
02:16:12,858 --> 02:16:14,692
All the best, sir...
- Thanks.

2102
02:16:48,692 --> 02:16:53,025
The money you can never expect,
he should not win the race at any cost.

2103
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:55,900
Kill if needed, but don't let him win.

2104
02:18:50,048 --> 02:18:52,823
If you lose,
will you leave your father forever?

2105
02:19:06,108 --> 02:19:08,567
Jockey should match
with the horse body language.

2106
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:11,150
You not fall down at any cost.

2107
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:13,983
In case you fall down...
Don't give up.

2108
02:19:14,358 --> 02:19:17,775
Try matching it with the horse power...
Horse will tune according to you.

2109
02:19:45,525 --> 02:19:47,025
Come on...
Come on...

2110
02:20:08,791 --> 02:20:10,345
Come on, Siddhu!

2111
02:20:17,304 --> 02:20:19,650
Come on, Siddhu...
Come on...

2112
02:20:50,441 --> 02:20:52,025
Come on, Siddhu...

2113
02:21:15,525 --> 02:21:19,817
Remember one thing...
Your heart beat must match the horse's!

2114
02:22:26,637 --> 02:22:28,253
Come on, Siddhu...

2115
02:22:47,677 --> 02:22:50,724
Jockey number 6 is the winner.

2116
02:23:08,678 --> 02:23:13,271
My son has won and you lost!

2117
02:23:15,733 --> 02:23:16,857
Dad...

2118
02:23:19,255 --> 02:23:22,467
Yes, I know he is my son.

2119
02:23:26,983 --> 02:23:28,025
Dad...

2120
02:23:29,525 --> 02:23:30,567
Yes, son...

2121
02:23:35,118 --> 02:23:38,690
Will you leave and go
if you get angry on dad?

2122
02:23:38,740 --> 02:23:43,483
How, how could you go?
I strived every second for you...

2123
02:23:43,608 --> 02:23:44,858
Sorry, Dad...

2124
02:23:46,108 --> 02:23:47,275
Never again go.

2125
02:23:47,942 --> 02:23:48,985
I won't go.

2126
02:23:53,233 --> 02:23:55,150
I know that he is my son.

2127
02:23:58,775 --> 02:24:02,318
As you are my dad,
I accepted with the great love

2128
02:24:02,360 --> 02:24:04,659
on my son when you
brought this fellow.

2129
02:24:05,067 --> 02:24:08,983
But my inner soul kept on pushing him away
and made him be closer.

2130
02:24:12,275 --> 02:24:14,108
Do you know why I didn't tell till now?

2131
02:24:15,192 --> 02:24:17,775
For all of you to see.
Victory of my son...

2132
02:24:18,067 --> 02:24:18,897
What is this dad?

2133
02:24:18,939 --> 02:24:20,567
This is Candy floss...
You like it very much...

2134
02:24:24,442 --> 02:24:27,108
Not finished yet?
- It will finish if I eat.

2135
02:24:27,896 --> 02:24:28,846
Very nice.

2136
02:24:34,926 --> 02:24:36,150
Who gave you this chain dear?

2137
02:24:36,317 --> 02:24:37,192
Brother...

2138
02:24:37,277 --> 02:24:39,255
Don't hit me...
I will tell you.

2139
02:24:45,024 --> 02:24:46,275
Beat him.

2140
02:25:07,193 --> 02:25:08,502
Come on...

2141
02:25:08,835 --> 02:25:10,008
Come on...

2142
02:25:44,817 --> 02:25:47,983
There maybe someone to get you profits
when losses occur in business,

2143
02:25:48,895 --> 02:25:51,733
but there is only one
who will let his father win.

2144
02:25:53,324 --> 02:25:54,317
My son.

2145
02:25:55,900 --> 02:25:59,983
You won as a father,
but I lost as a father because of you.

2146
02:26:01,254 --> 02:26:03,442
But my son made me a winner.

2147
02:26:05,126 --> 02:26:07,900
You cheated me in a way no father would do.

2148
02:26:10,233 --> 02:26:12,900
He took so much pain
that a son would never take for a dad.

2149
02:26:14,192 --> 02:26:16,983
Never call me again...
Come on.

2150
02:26:17,733 --> 02:26:18,942
One minute, Dad.

2151
02:26:19,983 --> 02:26:23,650
I didn't come here for revenge,
but with a hope of getting love.

2152
02:26:24,692 --> 02:26:29,400
Mom used to say anger may separate
relations and love unites them.

2153
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:31,858
Let us make love win, Dad.

2154
02:26:32,067 --> 02:26:34,442
We will let grandpa be with us, Dad.

2155
02:26:34,692 --> 02:26:35,525
Please.

2156
02:26:38,608 --> 02:26:41,400
Your morale is above my age, son.

2157
02:26:41,567 --> 02:26:44,858
I did such a great a mistake.
I can't ask for forgiveness.

2158
02:26:46,358 --> 02:26:49,983
Forgive me grandson.
- No formalities between us, Grandpa...

2159
02:26:50,233 --> 02:26:52,108
Please, we are all one family.

2160
02:26:58,150 --> 02:26:59,275
Sorry.

2161
02:27:04,150 --> 02:27:05,067
What about me then?
