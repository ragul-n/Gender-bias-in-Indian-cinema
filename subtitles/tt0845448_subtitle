Shameless, useless!

You will not reform!

129
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:25,895
You will never reform!

130
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:32,437
What are you hiding behind?
- Nothing aunt.

00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:34,506

Oh really, papa!

135
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:49,978
First of all, you don`t pay the
rent, and then you steal too.

136
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:51,522
Aren`t you ashamed?

137
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:54,452
Now tell me, who will pay
me the 2 months rent..

138
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,926
..and the one who will
pay, come forward.

139
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:02,067
Manav, you will pay me the money.

140
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:05,168
Money, how can l pay the money?

141
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:07,468
Then why did you come forward?

142
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:08,665
Forward, l didn`t come forward!

143
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:12,539
Adi.
- Manav.

144
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:14,737
Who will pay me my money?

Roy, give aunt the money!
- Which money?

00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:25,490
The money that l had saved for
my sister`s cancer operation.

148
00:12:25,591 --> 00:12:28,526
But Adi, we are already
short of 10,000 rupees..

149
00:12:28,628 --> 00:12:32,428
..if we give that money to aunt,
then your sister will die.

150
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:36,763
Let her die! Let her die!
That`s her fate.

151
00:12:36,903 --> 00:12:42,773
Lord, my sister is coming and
this woman is sending her.

Enough, stop crying.
- Okay.

Then why are you crying?

158
00:13:13,873 --> 00:13:18,469
Adi never told me that
we have a sister too..

..and that she has cancer.
- What? - Yes.

Your liars! You cheats!

Now you can enter this house only
when you have the rent money.

162
00:13:31,491 --> 00:13:34,619
Shameless, go and look for work!

163
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:47,730
We will have to look for work.

00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:56,441

- This dead man will give us jobs.

166
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:58,174
But he can give us money!
- How is that?

167
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:01,113
Manav, bring that painting where
the horse is eating the grass.

168
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:04,121
Stealthily! Go.

169

idea, listen to me.

father`s memorabilia to you.

180
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,432
Father`s memorabilia?

181
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:27,403
Some days ago your father had come..

182
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:30,806
..in our art gallery, and he liked
this painting worth 20,000.

183
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,377
He has already given 1 ,000
rupees advance..

184
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:33,536
..and he had asked to collect
the remaining money..

185
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:34,944
..on delivery of the painting.
- Yes.

186
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:39,678
Painting. Strange, father didn`t
have any liking for paintings.

187
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:41,014
Did he want to die?
- No.

188
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,382
But still he did die.

189
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:45,423
Look, sometimes people
do some things..

190
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:47,959
..which they are never interested
in. How shocking!

191
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,118
Shocking!
- Very shocking!

192
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:51,423
Let it be brother, please
pay the money..

193
00:15:51,564 --> 00:15:54,226
..it will give solace to uncle`s
wandering soul. - Correct.

194
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:55,491
l don`t know where it is wandering.

195
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:58,229
For papa`s..
- Painting.

196
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:00,463
Our money.

197
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:02,097
This is twenty, here nineteen.

198
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:06,507
Give one thousand for good luck.
- Okay, thank you. - Greetings.

199
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:09,180
We have brought the painting with
such effort open it and see.

200
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:14,644
Stop!

201
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:18,519
Look, don`t ask for discount now!

202
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:20,923
What is this?
- lt is a painting, what else?

203
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:24,119
What is this painting of?

204
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:30,599
Horse eating grass.
- Really! Then where is the grass?

205
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:34,394
The horse ate up the grass.

206
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:35,997
Then where is the horse?

207
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:37,905
Why will the horse wait
after eating the grass?

208
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:41,411
He left, isn`t it brothers?
- Yes, you are right.

209
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:45,677
The horse, left we are leaving too.
Bye. - Bye. - Thank you.

210
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,413
Don`t take tension at all,
once the grass grows back..

211
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:53,149
..the horse will come back.

212
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:57,757
The grass will..

213
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,569
Get on the dance floor baby.

214
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:11,233
Move your body.

215
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:13,373
Get on the dance floor baby.

216
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:14,912

Your desires are like the bird.

00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:57,412
Who cares about the world,

Come, let`s go home.

00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:56,525
Come on, take out the money.

We spent it all,

274

l have an idea.
- Newspaper. - Obituary.

275
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:05,101
The next theft, l will do it.

276
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,472
Not you!

277
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:07,738
We will go and bring it!

278
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:16,646
Mr. Sameer?

279
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:18,689
Yes, l am Mr. Sameer Agarwal.

280
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:20,815
l am inspector Kulkarni,
crime branch.

281
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:25,490
The four people that murdered
your father..

282
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:29,624
..the police suspect that they
are the members of Pasha gang.

283
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:38,908
Mr. Agarwal was murdered at
9 o`clock in the evening..

284
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:42,109
..but he had left
home at 6 o`clock.

285
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:45,847
Can you tell me why
he had gone out?

286
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:49,512
Excuse me, we want to
meet Mr. Agarwal.

287
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:50,913
What work do you have?

288
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:53,581
He was saying on the phone,
try to understand..

289
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,919
..l can give only 50,000 now.

290
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:59,255
So, he had given that
50,000 to you.

291
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:00,864
Advance, do you doubt it?

292
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,527
l remembered, papa was saying
something on the phone.

293
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:06,461
He was saying that if the
horse befriends the hay..

294
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:08,072
..then what will he eat.

295
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,805
l think someone was blackmailing
Mr. Agarwal.

296
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:15,879
l think that the horse and
hay were their code words.

297
00:22:16,015 --> 00:22:17,539
Tell me sir.
- Yes.

298
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,842
Seems like you have quite a good
acquaintance with Mr. Agarwal.

299
00:22:20,953 --> 00:22:23,478
Our work is such, we have
to keep acquaintance..

300
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:26,750
..with influential people,
understood. Go.

301
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:28,551
Excuse me Mr. Sameer.

302
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:30,986
Hurry up, we don`t have time.

303
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:33,030
Are we insane, hurry up!

305
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:36,966
Let me see that painting too.

306
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:38,761

Sorry.

313
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:55,911
The horse was lying down.

314
00:22:57,723 --> 00:22:58,985
Horse and grass!

315
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:00,992
Arrest them!
- What are you doing?

316
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,695
Now l will never attend anyone`s
condolence meeting.

317
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:12,464
There won`t be any need,
because people..

318
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:13,866
..will attend our
condolence meeting.

319
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:23,147
Peter did you recognise, this is
Kulkarni sir`s favourite road.

320
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:27,073
Yes, last time he encountered
Tiku Tarzan right here.

l had seen it.

322
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:32,418
Pistol in the hand, and the
button of the shirt was open.

323
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:35,083
As soon as the van stopped and
he made Tiku Tarzan get down..

324
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:37,689
..he understood that he
is going to die for sure.

325
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,633
Sir does the right thing, abducts
him and that`s it.. Encounter.

326
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:46,227
Do you know, what is Kulkarni

00:25:19,598 --> 00:25:23,534
You all are free.
- Okay. - No!

356
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:27,127
Sir, you will shoot us
from behind, won`t you?

357
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:28,737
Can`t l shoot you from front!

358
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:31,206
Please sir, sir please forgive us.

359
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:36,404
Sir please sir, sir please
forgive us sir.

360
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:38,607
We are your children sir!

361
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,480
He is gone.

362
00:25:44,623 --> 00:25:48,684
We are safe!
- We are safe! - We are safe!

363
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:30,865
Come on..

364
00:26:34,606 --> 00:26:37,473
Oh god.

365
00:26:43,482 --> 00:26:44,540
There is no one in the car.

366
00:26:45,684 --> 00:26:47,413
Now if the car drives
without the driver..

367
00:26:47,552 --> 00:26:49,076
..then it will surely
meet with an accident.

368
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,026
There he is.

369
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:57,219
Come, come, come.

370
00:26:57,429 --> 00:26:58,828
My God! O my God!

371
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:00,488
Oh god, he is badly hurt.

372
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:05,126
We should take him to the hospital.

373
00:27:05,871 --> 00:27:13,607
l.. l.. l.. l know that
my time has come.

374
00:27:13,712 --> 00:27:14,906
No sir, nothing will happen to you.

375
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:18,175
We will bring the ambulance, you..
- There is no use.

376
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:27,185
Listen carefully what
l am saying right now.

377
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,189
Have you seen Goa?

378
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:34,762
No sir we haven`t, are
you a travel agent?

379
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,934
Shut up Manav! Go and bring water.

380
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:38,193
Sorry.

381
00:27:40,472 --> 00:27:43,999
Look, l don`t have much time.

382
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:53,411
ln Goa, in St. Sebastian garden,
below a big W..

383
00:27:53,552 --> 00:28:00,890
..below a big W, there
are ten crore rupees.

384
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,494
100 Million!
- 100 Million!

385
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:13,231
Yes, it is my life earnings.

386
00:28:13,972 --> 00:28:17,066
But why.. are you telling
all this to us?

387
00:28:17,242 --> 00:28:24,705
Because.. you look like good people.

388
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:30,648
Otherwise, in today`s world no one
comes forward to help someone.

389
00:28:32,858 --> 00:28:38,524
Anyway, all that money
is useless for me.

390
00:28:40,532 --> 00:28:45,936
Take the money, divide
it amongst yourself..

391
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:50,541
..then the entire world
will be at your feet.

392
00:28:52,544 --> 00:28:54,944
The entire world will respect you.

393
00:28:57,015 --> 00:29:04,285
Fulfil your dreams with that money.

394
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:09,152
And live life like kings.

395
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:13,622
Like kings.. life..

396
00:29:27,846 --> 00:29:29,108
God.
- He is dead.

397
00:29:29,514 --> 00:29:31,982
Yes, and while dying he played
a very big joke with us.

398
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:40,119
Joke! A dying man never lies!

399
00:29:40,258 --> 00:29:46,060
No! No!
- A dying man.. never..

400
00:29:52,537 --> 00:29:53,595
Dead.

401
00:29:58,143 --> 00:29:59,201
Water.

402
00:29:59,945 --> 00:30:01,003
He is dead.

403
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:10,680
What was that uncle
saying about Goa?

404
00:30:11,556 --> 00:30:15,492
Uncle was saying that there is
a St. Sebastian garden in Goa..

405
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:18,562
..and he has hidden a
100 million below a W.

406
00:30:18,697 --> 00:30:20,164
We have to go and take
That money out.

407
00:30:20,298 --> 00:30:23,699
Why should we take it out, are we
his servants to work for him.

408
00:30:28,807 --> 00:30:36,612
100 million! 100 million!
We are millionaires!

409
00:30:36,715 --> 00:30:38,046
100 million!
- 100 million!

410
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:42,847
l don`t believe it!
- l don`t believe it too!

411
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:45,180
Are we going to play KBC?

412
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:05,601
Another police.

413
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:07,468
Listen, don`t tell the
police anything..

414
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:09,546
..about St. Sebastian garden.
- Okay.

415
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:11,280
And about the 100 million?

416
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:21,625
Side, side.

417
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:30,228
You escaped my clutches again.

418
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:35,230
Who saw the dead body first?

419
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:39,775
Who saw the dead body first?
- No one.

420
00:31:40,178 --> 00:31:41,440
What do you mean by no one?

421
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,639
l mean when we reached here he was
not dead, he was still alive.

422
00:31:43,782 --> 00:31:44,840
What do you mean he was still alive?

423
00:31:44,983 --> 00:31:46,507
He was just about to die?

424
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:47,945
What do you mean he
Was about to die?

425
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:49,452
He had a few breaths left.

426
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:50,919
But he died right then.

427
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:54,521
Come on, come in a line, come on!

428
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:59,526
Now tell me, was he alive or dead?

429
00:31:59,998 --> 00:32:03,195
He was alive, a bit.

430
00:32:04,202 --> 00:32:06,670
Just like you are before people die.

431
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:09,064
Did he say anything before dying?

432
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:10,674
Did he give any information?

433
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:13,141
He was saying something,
but l didn`t understand.

434
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,541
l understood.

435
00:32:15,647 --> 00:32:18,445
Constable, take them to
the police station.

436
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,608
But sir, we..
- Shut up!

437
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:22,686
Come on! Quickly.

438
00:32:24,689 --> 00:32:29,149
Sir, the boss is dead, now what
will you tell the commissioner sir?

439
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:30,888
l was thinking the same thing.

440
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:32,958
Search the dead body.

441
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:34,756
Come on, into the jeep, come on.

442
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:36,024
Sit in the jeep.

443
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:40,766
Not behind me, sit in the jeep.

444
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:48,503
lnspector sir!

445
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,582
Why are you running?

446
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:56,380
lf we wouldn`t have
fled the inspector..

447
00:32:56,454 --> 00:32:57,580
..would have found out everything.

448
00:32:57,689 --> 00:33:00,954
He has a jeep, he can catch
us in two minutes.

449
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:04,460
He cannot catch us, because
detective Roy..

450
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:05,995
..has brought his jeeps keys along.

451
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:09,057
Superb!

452
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:11,866
Then which key have l brought?

453
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:16,132
Sir, they took the keys
to my house too.

454
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:19,443
Not just the keys, they have fled ..

455
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:22,479
..with the secret to
the chit fund fraud..

456
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:25,549
..which l am after for
the past 10 years.

457
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:27,881
205 accounting everyone.

458
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:30,477
Only one person can
go to Goa in this.

459
00:33:31,056 --> 00:33:33,047
l will do on thing, l will go
to Goa and bring the money.

460
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:34,420
Wait..
- What happened?

461
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,026
Has the doctor restricted
me from going to Goa?

462
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:37,423
Listen, either all of
us will go together..

463
00:33:37,562 --> 00:33:38,824
..or none of us will go. Thank you.

464
00:33:39,464 --> 00:33:42,865
Do what you want to, l want
to go to the bathroom.

465
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:44,434
Quiet!
- Keep quiet!

466
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:48,164
First of all that inspector is
after us. lf he nabs us, then?

467
00:33:48,506 --> 00:33:50,497
We have to reach Goa
as soon as possible.

468
00:33:50,842 --> 00:33:53,037
Look, if all of us want
to go to Goa together..

469
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:54,977
..then there is only
one way for that.

470
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:02,716
No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

471
00:34:02,854 --> 00:34:04,515
No, no, no.
- Quiet!

472
00:34:04,656 --> 00:34:07,124
Dad will kill me if l touch his car!

473
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:08,520
There is no chance.

474
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,389
By the time your father finds
out in the morning..

475
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:12,486
..by then we will be
in Goa, isn`t it?

476
00:34:12,597 --> 00:34:14,462
Yes, there will be money
in your pocket..

477
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:17,261
..you will be the father of your
father, isn`t it Adi? - Yes.

478
00:34:17,435 --> 00:34:18,493
But..

479
00:34:18,603 --> 00:34:19,661
Then..

480
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:20,930
But..
- So..

481
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,532
Okay, come on.

482
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:29,408
You both go near the car, we
will bring the key. - Okay.

483
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:31,674
Where are you going, come on!

484
00:34:36,955 --> 00:34:38,013
Key.

485
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:39,214
The car key.

486
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:41,616
No!

487
00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:55,564
Manav, hold this screw driver.

488
00:35:01,713 --> 00:35:03,704
The car is there.

489
00:35:05,784 --> 00:35:08,446
Manav, the screw driver!
- l am holding the screw driver.

490
00:35:08,586 --> 00:35:10,520
Take a look where
you are holding it!

491
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:13,515
l am sorry.
- Let it be.

492
00:35:13,658 --> 00:35:14,716
Whatever you say.

493
00:35:16,528 --> 00:35:19,520
l can`t even abuse you.
- Why?

494
00:36:06,845 --> 00:36:07,903
Who is it?

495
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,240
Who is it? Who is it?

496
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:26,795
You are voicing the telephones ring.

497
00:36:26,865 --> 00:36:31,325
Fool, the telephone is dead
since the past two days..

498
00:36:31,436 --> 00:36:34,371
..now l will not spare you.
- No Dad, no dad.

499
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:36,406
Com out, you come out!

500
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:40,602
You think l am a fool! You
had come to steal the car!

501
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:47,741
What did you do? - He is only
unconscious, take the keys.

502
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:56,753
l am there too, brother.

503
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:58,419
Kamble, until they are not found..

504
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:01,498
..you will not move from the
airport, is that understood.

505
00:37:01,766 --> 00:37:04,030
Appoint 25 more men at
the railway station..

506
00:37:04,168 --> 00:37:06,500
..l want all four of them
under any condition!

507
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:09,430
Until the four of them
are not caught..

508
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:11,906
..there should be tight barricade.

509
00:37:13,912 --> 00:37:15,607
Where can they go?

510
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:22,583
You have maintained the car
really well, really nice.

511
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,517
lt is not his, it is his fathers.

512
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:27,046
Come on.

513
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:36,391
Boman, catch him.

514
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:37,695
You don`t know how to drive.

515
00:37:37,802 --> 00:37:38,860
Why did you stop the car?

516
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:40,061
Look, our fathers.

517
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:44,132
Police!

518
00:37:45,443 --> 00:37:47,377
My detective mind says,
that police inspector..

519
00:37:47,478 --> 00:37:49,412
..has setup this barricade for us.

520
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:50,605
Hundred percent.

521
00:37:50,815 --> 00:37:53,010
So what should we do now?

522
00:37:53,685 --> 00:37:55,414
There is no problem, l know a way..

523
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:58,954
..it goes through the jungle and
meets the highway up ahead.

524
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,614
Don`t worry, turn the car.

525
00:38:00,758 --> 00:38:04,489
Turn the car, come on.

526
00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:24,973
Oh God.

527
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:38,855
Oh shit!
- Okay.

528
00:38:40,264 --> 00:38:41,526
Oh God.

529
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:51,272
Roy, you banged the car,
dad will not spare me!

530
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:53,271
l was trying to save the bear,
that`s why l banged the car.

531
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:57,845
You broke both the headlights,
it will cost 18,000.

532
00:38:57,949 --> 00:38:59,473
Why are you crying,
all three of us..

533
00:38:59,617 --> 00:39:01,744
..will give you 6,000 rupees each.

534
00:39:01,886 --> 00:39:05,014
Just a minute, which three.
- We three.

535
00:39:05,223 --> 00:39:06,281
And Manav?

536
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:08,415
We are not different, we
are one since childhood.

537
00:39:08,493 --> 00:39:09,551
We are brothers since childhood.

538
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:11,128
What do you mean brothers
since childhood!

539
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:12,491
My father will kill me!
- l am telling the truth.

540
00:39:12,597 --> 00:39:13,825
Just a minute.

541
00:39:13,965 --> 00:39:16,832
We three will pay 6,000 rupees
each for your light.

542
00:39:16,934 --> 00:39:17,992
Let it be!

543
00:39:18,102 --> 00:39:20,502
What let it be, now we will have to
spend the entire night in this car.

544
00:39:20,638 --> 00:39:23,300
We won`t, l have an idea.

545
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:29,447
Here l take the matches out,
and l light the fire..

546
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,571
..and there is light. Light. Manav.

547
00:39:31,983 --> 00:39:33,974
When l tried, all were burning.

548
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:44,523
Close the door! Close it!

549
00:39:44,996 --> 00:39:47,055
Thank god. Lock! Lock! Lock!

550
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:50,867
l have another idea, let
us sleep here tonight.

551
00:39:51,602 --> 00:39:55,003
Adi you are so clever, so clever.
- Thank you.

552
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:57,198
Mama would be so proud of you.
- Thank you.

553
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:00,135
Shut up!

554
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:03,944
What do you mean the boss died?

555
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:07,449
When did all this happen?
- Yesterday evening, sir.

556
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:09,816
lt happened yesterday evening,
and you are telling me today!

557
00:40:09,954 --> 00:40:11,285
But sir..
- Shut up!

558
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:12,980
What were you doing from
yesterday evening?

559
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:14,956
Sir l was trying your mobile,
but l couldn`t reach you.

560
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:17,618
Shut up! How did all this happen?

561
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:21,523
Sir, maybe there is a bit of
a problem in your network.

562
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:23,497
There is no problem in my network..

563
00:40:23,634 --> 00:40:25,693
..there is problem in your work!

564
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:30,399
lt was so important for us
to catch the boss alive.

565
00:40:30,508 --> 00:40:33,443
We have lost it, we have lost
the information worth million..

566
00:40:33,544 --> 00:40:35,808
..because of which l
was to be promoted

567
00:40:35,913 --> 00:40:37,778
You have ruined everything!

568
00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:39,507
l am at loss too sir.

569
00:40:39,851 --> 00:40:42,445
For the past 10 years
because of this case..

570
00:40:42,587 --> 00:40:44,782
..you stopped my promotion too.
- Shut up!

571
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,525
You care about the promotion!
The promotion!

572
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:51,261
l was after the boss for
the past 10 years.

573
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:52,587
Not you sir, me.

574
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:57,429
Who appointed you?
- You did.

575
00:40:57,535 --> 00:41:01,471
You will have to go, now you
will have to go to Yavatmal.

576
00:41:01,606 --> 00:41:03,938
Why sir, where is Yavatmal sir?

577
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:11,549
You will receive it sir, you
will get it by tomorrow.

578
00:41:12,016 --> 00:41:13,074
What is this sir?

579
00:41:14,552 --> 00:41:18,010
You will get your transfer
order by tomorrow. Get out!

580
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:19,282
But sir..
- Get out!

581
00:41:19,557 --> 00:41:22,151
This is what l get for doing my
duty honestly for 10 years.

582
00:41:26,898 --> 00:41:27,956
Who are you?

583
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:32,828
Nari (Woman), l am Nari.
- Nari, but you look like a man.

584
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:37,640
Contractor, my name
is Nari contractor.

585
00:41:37,975 --> 00:41:41,570
My stupid son, ran away
with my sweetheart.

586
00:41:41,712 --> 00:41:43,577
l have come to lodge
a complain for that.

587
00:41:45,049 --> 00:41:46,107
But this is a car.

588
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,777
For you, for me it is my sweetheart.

589
00:41:49,987 --> 00:41:53,514
And this is my stupid son, Boman..

590
00:41:53,658 --> 00:41:57,526
..who has stolen my car along with
is three scoundrel friends.

591
00:41:57,662 --> 00:41:59,152
Boman.

592
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:05,001
This is your son.
- Yes.

593
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:09,071
And he has stolen your car.
- He has stolen my sweetheart.

594
00:42:11,142 --> 00:42:13,076
Kabir you are back in business.

595
00:42:17,548 --> 00:42:23,612
The moving thing is called a car.
- What are you singing?

596
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:27,151
Why we have stopped?

597
00:42:32,096 --> 00:42:34,758
God, what will we do now?

598
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:38,128
Simple, we will have
to make the car jump.

599
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:44,504
You will make the car jump.
- l am serious. - Shut up!

600
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:46,843
Have you gone mad! Come on, let
us go back to the highway,

601
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,378
Come on everyone, come on now.

602
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:49,504
lf we go back then that inspector..

603
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,638
..and your father will
be waiting for us.

604
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:55,846
And if we cross this, then
we will be rich. - But..

605
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,980
Don`t worry dude, my calculation
is absolutely perfect.

606
00:42:59,056 --> 00:43:03,516
How? - This broken portion will
be approximately 9 feet.

607
00:43:03,594 --> 00:43:04,652
Right.
- Right.

608
00:43:04,762 --> 00:43:06,423
lf we drive the car at 81 km/hour..

609
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:09,465
..if we make it jump
at 45 degree angle..

610
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,797
..the car will cross
to the other side.

611
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:15,538
You are right, l will demonstrate
it right now.

612
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,198
Piece of cake.

613
00:43:17,341 --> 00:43:19,536
This is the car. This is the speed.

614
00:43:19,744 --> 00:43:21,609
And this is the angle.

615
00:43:31,555 --> 00:43:35,491
Now the distance is 20 feet, so
the speed will be 120 kilometres

616
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,418
Perfect.

617
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:40,793
You both have gone mad!
You are talking nonsense!

618
00:43:40,898 --> 00:43:43,093
The car cannot go on that
side, l am telling you!

619
00:43:43,234 --> 00:43:44,496
Shut up!

620
00:43:46,103 --> 00:43:47,502
Trust us!

621
00:43:47,638 --> 00:43:48,696
But..

622
00:43:48,973 --> 00:43:50,031
But..

623
00:43:50,174 --> 00:43:51,971
Then..
- Okay!

624
00:43:54,512 --> 00:43:55,570
Chill boy.

625
00:44:06,857 --> 00:44:08,449
Come on Adi!
- Yeah Roy.

626
00:44:08,592 --> 00:44:09,923
Let`s go!
- Yeah!

627
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:43,483
Adi, you are so smart.
- Thank you, thank you.

628
00:44:47,698 --> 00:44:52,431
Oh wow, what a jump.

629
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:54,504
Your calculation was absolutely
right. - Thanks man.

630
00:44:57,041 --> 00:44:58,565
The car is banged up.

631
00:44:59,577 --> 00:45:00,839
Boman my brother..

632
00:45:01,846 --> 00:45:02,904
Listen..

633
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,511
But listen to us..

634
00:45:04,849 --> 00:45:06,510
Why are you getting so angry?

635
00:45:07,118 --> 00:45:10,383
Scoundrels because of both
of you my car is banged up!

636
00:45:10,454 --> 00:45:12,445
This is my father`s
car and not yours!

637
00:45:12,523 --> 00:45:14,388
My papa will kill me!

638
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:15,516
Stop it.

639
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:17,423
We were giving you 6,000 each.

640
00:45:17,528 --> 00:45:19,120
Add another 5,000 in it.

641
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:22,528
Only the mudguard is banged up,
you are reacting as if..

642
00:45:31,475 --> 00:45:33,466
As if your car blew up.

643
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:46,485
Boman, no one can stop
when the time has come.

644
00:45:51,962 --> 00:45:53,429
Your car was half dead, and now..

645
00:45:53,564 --> 00:45:56,965
..its last rite has
been performed too.

646
00:46:00,971 --> 00:46:04,702
Don`t worry, your dad will
die too seeing the car.

647
00:46:05,509 --> 00:46:07,500
Promise.
- l swear.

648
00:46:14,585 --> 00:46:16,644
The car had passed through here
last night at 1 o`clock.

649
00:46:20,124 --> 00:46:22,524
No sir, l have not moved from
here since last night.

650
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:24,060
This car didn`t pass through here.

651
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:26,493
They passed through the toll,
but didn`t reach here..

652
00:46:26,597 --> 00:46:27,655
..then where did they go?

653
00:46:27,798 --> 00:46:32,531
Sir, sir there is a path that
meets the highway up ahead.

654
00:46:33,003 --> 00:46:34,470
That`s it.. that`s it. yes..

655
00:46:39,777 --> 00:46:41,369
Adi, where have you brought us?

656
00:46:41,479 --> 00:46:44,004
Believe me, l know all
the shortcuts of Goa.

657
00:46:44,148 --> 00:46:45,479
Which shortcut is this?

658
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:49,408
Once we cross 50-60 thousand
trees and PlNKY-4 rivers..

659
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,044
..bang, you are on highway boss.

660
00:46:51,155 --> 00:46:52,417
You are counting the trees,
aren`t you?

661
00:46:52,556 --> 00:46:53,887
You are counting the trees..

662
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:56,890
Boman, keep quiet.

663
00:46:57,161 --> 00:46:59,152
l didn`t do it.

664
00:47:04,635 --> 00:47:05,693
What are you doing?

665
00:47:05,903 --> 00:47:07,632
Tying my shoe lace so
that l can run fast.

666
00:47:07,972 --> 00:47:10,236
Do you think you can run
faster than the lion?

667
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:12,567
Have you gone mad, who wants
to run faster than the lion.

668
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:14,639
l want to run faster then
the three of you.

669
00:47:15,713 --> 00:47:16,907
Don`t come behind me.

670
00:47:30,194 --> 00:47:32,128
This is a broken bridge.
- Yes.

671
00:47:37,134 --> 00:47:40,126
My son! My son!

672
00:47:41,205 --> 00:47:42,934
My son!

673
00:47:43,073 --> 00:47:46,600
Those scoundrels killed my son!

674
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:49,804
My son! My son!

675
00:48:00,824 --> 00:48:04,988
l swear.. l swear on
your engine oil..

676
00:48:05,496 --> 00:48:08,829
..l will seek those scoundrels
out from anywhere!

677
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:12,897
And l will make pieces of them
and feed them to the crows.

678
00:48:13,504 --> 00:48:18,567
Boman!

679
00:48:19,843 --> 00:48:22,505
When will we come to the road?

680
00:48:22,646 --> 00:48:24,511
The road won`t come, we have
to walk towards the road.

681
00:48:28,185 --> 00:48:30,517
Oh God, it has come.

682
00:48:30,654 --> 00:48:33,179
What, has the road come?
- No dead end.

683
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:40,590
Don`t try to run, the bullet of
my revolver is faster then you.

684
00:48:40,731 --> 00:48:43,131
Why did you think that
we were trying to run?

685
00:48:43,267 --> 00:48:44,529
l was guessing.

686
00:48:45,803 --> 00:48:49,068
What do you think you
can fool me and flee?

687
00:48:49,506 --> 00:48:52,031
Sir, you are misunderstanding us..

688
00:48:52,142 --> 00:48:55,942
..our friend fell ill, that`s
why we ran away from there.

689
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,275
But l had asked you to go
to the police station.

690
00:48:58,549 --> 00:49:01,712
Yes so, are we your servants
to agree your orders!

691
00:49:02,753 --> 00:49:05,551
He was saying that not me.
- Shut up.

692
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:10,283
Tell me, which one of
you wants to die first.

693
00:49:13,697 --> 00:49:14,891
Are you in a hurry to die?
- No.

694
00:49:17,968 --> 00:49:19,026
Then why did you come forward?

695
00:49:19,303 --> 00:49:20,565
When did l come in the front?

696
00:49:24,508 --> 00:49:27,443
l don`t know, in such
dangerous situations..

697
00:49:27,578 --> 00:49:29,512
..how l always come forward.

698
00:49:30,114 --> 00:49:31,706
You will have all the time to think
about it after you are death.

699
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:33,180
Please save me.

700
00:49:34,718 --> 00:49:36,379

Well tried Adi, well tried.

710
00:50:06,283 --> 00:50:09,013
lt is not your fault that
he has seen Sholay.

Roy well done. Shoot him!

715
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:26,561
lnspector, every father
has a father.

716
00:50:27,504 --> 00:50:29,563
And we call him grandfather.

717
00:50:32,576 --> 00:50:34,510
You were threatening us of death.

718
00:50:35,512 --> 00:50:37,571
We play with death everyday.

719
00:50:38,582 --> 00:50:42,712
lnspector, let us play the
game of death today.

720
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,774
There is a bullet in it.

00:51:08,879 --> 00:51:12,542
Roy, there is really a bullet in it.

You ready inspector, to

You are safe. He is safe.

726
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:37,573
Now it is my turn.
- Correct.

727
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:40,434
No! No..

728
00:51:40,511 --> 00:51:41,569
Roy there is a bullet in it!

729
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:42,736
Stop right there.

730
00:51:42,846 --> 00:51:44,438
This game of death is
between the inspector..

731
00:51:44,581 --> 00:51:47,175
..and detective Roy, right.
- Right.

732
00:51:51,188 --> 00:51:52,450
You will die!

733
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:54,523
Adi he is not so smart.
- Yes.

734
00:52:02,533 --> 00:52:03,591
Roy!

735
00:52:21,919 --> 00:52:25,514
Enough, what did Bose
say before dying.

736
00:52:25,622 --> 00:52:27,419
Subhash Chandra Bose said,
`You give me blood..

737
00:52:27,558 --> 00:52:29,549
..and l will give you freedom`.

738
00:52:29,827 --> 00:52:31,226
Jai Hind!

739
00:52:32,896 --> 00:52:34,955
l will tell you! l will tell you!

740
00:52:35,098 --> 00:52:38,226
Have you gone mad?
- Quiet! l value my life.

741
00:52:38,368 --> 00:52:39,426
Sir, l will tell you.

742
00:52:39,536 --> 00:52:42,403
Before dying Bose said that
he has hidden 100 million..

743
00:52:42,506 --> 00:52:45,441
..in Chiplun, 40 feet away
from the main square..

744
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:47,168
..4 feet under the chickoo tree.

745
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:49,911
Chiplun! Chiplun!

746
00:52:50,514 --> 00:52:53,915
You cheaters, deceivers!
You bloody baskets!

747
00:52:54,017 --> 00:52:57,418
You lied to me, you told me
that man said before dying..

748
00:52:57,521 --> 00:53:01,457
..that he has hidden 100 million
in St. Sebastian..

749
00:53:01,592 --> 00:53:03,526
..garden under some W in Goa!

750
00:53:04,061 --> 00:53:06,256
You are not worthy of
being called friends.

751
00:53:06,597 --> 00:53:07,859
Cheater cocks!

752
00:53:07,998 --> 00:53:10,523
Enough Manav.
- What enough!

753
00:53:11,602 --> 00:53:16,539
Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.

754
00:53:16,673 --> 00:53:19,540
Excuse me, look l have proposal.

755
00:53:19,676 --> 00:53:22,076
Look, we can distribute that
money amongst ourselves.

756
00:53:22,479 --> 00:53:24,470
lf you will give the entire
money to the government..

757
00:53:24,615 --> 00:53:25,809
..what will you get?
- Correct.

758
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:30,950
What did l get after doing my
doing honestly for 10 years..

759
00:53:31,555 --> 00:53:32,886
..transfer to Yavatmal.

760
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:36,425
That`s why those 100 million
will go in my pocket..

761
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,620
..and not in the government
treasury. - What?

762
00:53:40,564 --> 00:53:41,622
One more thing?

763
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:44,895
You play the game of death
everyday, don`t you?

764
00:53:46,103 --> 00:53:47,502
Let`s have a game with me too.

765
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:52,503
lnspector sir!

766
00:53:54,778 --> 00:53:58,714
Hey, where are you going?
- Hey, don`t move.

767
00:54:01,518 --> 00:54:02,576
Manav, why are you laughing?

768
00:54:03,921 --> 00:54:07,721
That inspector is so stupid.

769
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:11,158
He tied our necks,
he tied our hands..

770
00:54:11,495 --> 00:54:15,829
..but he didn`t tie our legs,
come on lets go to Goa.

771
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:18,458
Have you gone mad, stand straight..

772
00:54:18,602 --> 00:54:21,730
..or the four of us will die.
- All four.

773
00:54:21,872 --> 00:54:25,467
Of course all four of us, the
noose around your neck..

774
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:29,067
..that is been crossed around
the tree and in Boman`s neck.

775
00:54:30,147 --> 00:54:32,411
And the noose that`s
around my neck..

776
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:36,007
..that is been crossed around
the tree and in Roy`s neck.

777
00:54:36,553 --> 00:54:39,215
lf anyone of us moves,
then we all will die.

778
00:54:39,389 --> 00:54:44,383
Adi, you are so creative.
- Thank you, thank you.

779
00:54:44,494 --> 00:54:47,429
Adi, keep quiet, don`t talk and
especially to this Manav..

780
00:54:47,564 --> 00:54:49,964
..all this has happened
because of him.

781
00:54:51,435 --> 00:54:52,766
What did l do?

782
00:54:52,869 --> 00:54:54,393
You told that inspector everything..

783
00:54:54,504 --> 00:54:56,563
..and he hung us here and left.

784
00:54:56,707 --> 00:54:58,231
What did you do when you
had the gun in your hand?

785
00:54:58,375 --> 00:54:59,899
l will play the game of death,
the game of death.

786
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:01,068
Now we are all stuck.

787
00:55:01,178 --> 00:55:02,907
l was just..

788
00:55:03,046 --> 00:55:06,573
lf you will keep arguing like
this, then l am leaving.

789
00:55:07,784 --> 00:55:09,445
Don`t move! Don`t move!

790
00:55:09,586 --> 00:55:10,780
Don`t move! Don`t move from there!

791
00:55:11,588 --> 00:55:13,249
l will think of something.

792
00:55:13,924 --> 00:55:16,825
Yes you think, think
something for me too.

793
00:55:20,998 --> 00:55:24,729
Cheetah.
- Cheetah!

794
00:55:25,535 --> 00:55:29,471
Cheetah!
- Cheetah. Cheetah!

795
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:35,474
Look, he is slowly growing up.

796
00:55:35,812 --> 00:55:39,407
He is not growing up slowly you
fool, he is coming closer.

797
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:46,546
Lord! O Lord! O Lord!

798
00:55:51,561 --> 00:55:53,495
Why am l sweating so much?

799
00:55:54,431 --> 00:55:56,956
You are not sweating he has wet
his pants seeing the cheetah!

800
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,228
Move! Move! l will thrash you!

801
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:01,428
Don`t move! Don`t move!

802
00:56:01,505 --> 00:56:03,370
Now you are just drenched,
if you move too much..

803
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,431
..then you become dirty too.

804
00:56:05,509 --> 00:56:07,374
lf we survive from here,
l will murder you.

805
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:10,412
Stop your nonsense, the cheetah
is coming closer..

806
00:56:10,514 --> 00:56:12,709
..scare him away, scare him away.
- How?

807
00:56:12,849 --> 00:56:16,785
lmitate the voice of a lion,
a lion. - Yes.

808
00:56:25,128 --> 00:56:27,653
Are you scaring him or inviting him?

809
00:56:28,065 --> 00:56:30,465
lmitate the voice of a lion,
a lion. - Yes.

810
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:39,833
He ran away.

811
00:56:39,943 --> 00:56:43,401
Baban, he ran away.
- Thank you. Thank you.

812
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:46,015
Boman you are so smart also.

813
00:57:00,497 --> 00:57:02,965
Manav don`t move, or
all of us will die.

814
00:57:04,768 --> 00:57:07,635
Something has gone in my pants.

815
00:57:12,042 --> 00:57:13,566
lt is tickling me.

816
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:15,575
Don`t move, or all of us will die.

817
00:57:29,593 --> 00:57:30,651
We are safe!

818
00:57:30,994 --> 00:57:32,461
We are safe!

819
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:34,188
We are safe!

820
00:57:36,967 --> 00:57:41,028
Adi! Adi

821
00:57:41,138 --> 00:57:42,400
We are safe!

822
00:57:42,539 --> 00:57:44,063
Hey, save us..

823
00:57:50,013 --> 00:57:54,609
That scoundrel inspector must
have gone quite far by now.

824
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:56,810
No, he wont have gone very far.

825
00:57:57,754 --> 00:57:58,812
How do you know?

826
00:57:59,089 --> 00:58:01,489
Because when l had fallen
unconscious, then..

827
00:58:13,503 --> 00:58:15,494
According to my calculation..

828
00:58:16,173 --> 00:58:17,834
..that inspector might
not have gone far.

829
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:30,450
lt will take atleast 15-20 minutes
to change the pipe..

830
00:58:30,587 --> 00:58:32,646
..until then have some
tea at the inn.

831
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:34,518
Hurry up.
- Right now sir.

832
00:58:56,213 --> 00:58:58,681
You are not a hero
but a villain..

833
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:02,942
l had told you, that inspector
must not have gone far.

834
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,087
l have a very good idea..

835
00:59:05,555 --> 00:59:07,216
..let us flee with
the inspectors car.

836
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:10,558
lf we have the car then what
is the need to flee. - Correct.

837
00:59:11,027 --> 00:59:12,494
lf this time the
inspector catches us..

838
00:59:12,629 --> 00:59:14,290
..then he will hang us
in a different way.

839
00:59:14,631 --> 00:59:16,496
And before he can hang us again..

840
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:17,964
..we should take care of him.

841
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:29,242
Yes.
- Senior inspector Adi.

842
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:31,513
lnspector Roy.
- Yes.

843
00:59:31,715 --> 00:59:33,512
Where is Pasha?
- Pasha?

844
00:59:33,783 --> 00:59:36,445
Yes, the man that came in that car.

845
00:59:36,586 --> 00:59:37,678
ln this jeep.

846
00:59:37,921 --> 00:59:40,515
Yes, he is a very dangerous
criminal..

847
00:59:40,857 --> 00:59:43,052
..and he poses as a inspector.

848
00:59:43,593 --> 00:59:48,053
He first tried to kill us, and
then fled with out the jeep.

849
00:59:48,465 --> 00:59:49,523
What are you saying?

850
00:59:49,666 --> 00:59:52,134
Tried to kill us, and then
fled with out jeep. - What?

851
00:59:52,269 --> 00:59:54,794
Tried to kill us, and then
fled with out jeep. - What?

852
00:59:56,539 --> 00:59:58,200
l have already said it twice,
are you deaf?

853
00:59:59,609 --> 01:00:01,076
There is also a reward on him.

854
01:00:01,544 --> 01:00:03,273
How much?
- 15 hundred thousand!

855
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,742
15 hundred thousand!

856
01:00:04,814 --> 01:00:06,406
15 hundred thousand!

857
01:00:06,483 --> 01:00:12,888
What are you saying?

858
01:00:12,956 --> 01:00:16,551
l am right. And whoever
helps us in catching him..

859
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,458
..he will get a reward of 15 hundred
thousand from the government.

860
01:00:19,562 --> 01:00:20,620
15 hundred thousand!

861
01:00:20,764 --> 01:00:25,633
l will get 15 hundred thousand! l
will catch him! l will catch him!

862
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:34,233
So you survived.

863
01:00:34,911 --> 01:00:39,439
We survived Pasha, but you cannot
escape the law Pasha.

864
01:00:39,516 --> 01:00:41,848
Pasha, who is Pasha?
- You are Pasha.

865
01:00:41,952 --> 01:00:43,010
l am Pasha?

866
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,713
He said, l am Pasha.
- Pasha.

867
01:00:45,855 --> 01:00:47,516
Your game is over Pasha.

868
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:51,717
What Pasha, l am inspector Kabir.

869
01:00:51,861 --> 01:00:54,659

Or else we will push

883
01:02:35,565 --> 01:02:38,227
..will reach commissioner
Chaturvedi.

884
01:02:43,106 --> 01:02:45,506
We have typed the complete message.
- Yes.

885
01:02:45,642 --> 01:02:48,236
We just need to press it.
- The button, the button.

886
01:02:49,512 --> 01:02:51,207
But in that way, you won`t
get anything too.

887
01:02:51,448 --> 01:02:54,440
No problem, we don`t care of
we don`t get 100 million..

888
01:02:54,584 --> 01:02:56,916
..but we won`t let you
get that money too.

889
01:02:59,589 --> 01:03:03,992
My fingers move faster
then your legs.

890
01:03:05,128 --> 01:03:06,527
Stop right there inspector.

891
01:03:09,265 --> 01:03:10,857
There is no network in this.

892
01:03:17,807 --> 01:03:20,605
Got it, got it, l got the network.

893
01:03:22,612 --> 01:03:23,670
l understood.

894
01:03:24,614 --> 01:03:25,876
You want to compromise.

895
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:31,678
Yes.

896
01:03:35,758 --> 01:03:37,692
Look, l have a solution for it.

897
01:03:38,094 --> 01:03:41,689
Eighty percent ours, and
twenty percent yours.

898
01:03:41,798 --> 01:03:43,390
Twenty percent mine.
- Yes.

899
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,558
Do you agree or should
l send the message.

900
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:46,692
Give me the phone, l will
send the message.

901
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:49,761
lf l wanted only twenty percent..

902
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:54,237
..then what was the need for
me to compromise with you.

903
01:03:54,544 --> 01:03:55,806
l would have told the government..

904
01:03:55,912 --> 01:03:57,436
..about the 100 million, and
then l would have received..

905
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:58,911
..20 percent officially.

906
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:02,441
And then medals, and then
interview in the papers..

907
01:04:02,585 --> 01:04:04,246
..and televisions.

908
01:04:05,588 --> 01:04:06,646
Should l send the message?

909
01:04:07,657 --> 01:04:09,056
No, no..

910
01:04:09,459 --> 01:04:12,724
l have another solution, 60-40.

911
01:04:12,795 --> 01:04:14,456
60 percent ours and
40 percent yours.

912
01:04:14,531 --> 01:04:16,396
Please, please don`t create
trouble for us.

913
01:04:16,499 --> 01:04:17,557
Please leave something for us.

914
01:04:17,667 --> 01:04:18,793
Done. Thank you.

915
01:04:18,902 --> 01:04:20,494
60 percent mine and 40 percent
yours. - Thank you.

916
01:04:20,603 --> 01:04:23,595
Sir, according to that how
much money do l get?

917
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:26,732
1 .5 million.
- How is that?

918
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:28,068
What do you mean how?

919
01:04:28,178 --> 01:04:30,840
How much is 60% of 100 million?
60 million right.

920
01:04:30,947 --> 01:04:34,405
And how much is 1/4 of 6 million,
1 .5 million, simple

921
01:04:34,551 --> 01:04:36,212
Where has this 4th share come from?

922
01:04:36,553 --> 01:04:38,350
One, Two, Three and Four..

923
01:04:38,421 --> 01:04:40,548
You both are the same unit.

924
01:04:40,657 --> 01:04:42,648
That.. that..

925
01:04:42,759 --> 01:04:48,095
What that.. last night you said
that you both are the same unit.

926
01:04:48,231 --> 01:04:51,166
According to that we will divide
2 million in 3 shares.

927
01:04:51,501 --> 01:04:52,729
That doesn`t happen.

928
01:04:52,869 --> 01:04:56,236
ls it? Your justice is only while
taking money, not when giving.

929
01:04:56,372 --> 01:04:58,363
When you had to give 6,000
for the headlight..

930
01:04:58,474 --> 01:04:59,532
..at that time you were one unit.

931
01:04:59,642 --> 01:05:03,043
And now that you have to take 6
million, then you are two units.

932
01:05:03,179 --> 01:05:07,047
There will be only three shares,
his, mine and the both of you.

933
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:09,645
Then how much money will l get?
- Quiet

934
01:05:09,786 --> 01:05:11,048
1 million, that`s all.

935
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,384
How 1 million, 1 .5 million!

936
01:05:13,456 --> 01:05:15,583
We will not take anything
less than 3 million.

937
01:05:15,658 --> 01:05:18,525
Are you being stubborn?
- Yes l am.

938
01:05:18,628 --> 01:05:20,027
What do you mean by that?

939
01:05:20,129 --> 01:05:23,860
Give me the phone, l will send the
message to the commissioner.

940
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,935
Just a minute, how did the
commissioner come in between?

941
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:31,201
Listen to me, it is best that
you divide the money equally.

942
01:05:31,808 --> 01:05:32,866
And hurry up.

943
01:05:33,009 --> 01:05:34,943
How much money will l get?

944
01:05:35,078 --> 01:05:38,946
1 million 5 hundred thousand each,
and you all agree to it.

945
01:05:39,048 --> 01:05:44,384
Okay, then l want 9 hundred
thousand 47 thousand of my dad`s car.

946
01:05:44,487 --> 01:05:46,421
But..
- No buts, l don`t want that money..

947
01:05:46,556 --> 01:05:48,888
..apart from the 1 million
5 hundred thousand.

948
01:05:49,025 --> 01:05:50,959
Okay keep it.
- What do you mean?

949
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:53,392
Boman, when your father kicked
you out of the house..

950
01:05:53,496 --> 01:05:56,090
..then l paid your rent,
leave that too.

951
01:05:56,232 --> 01:05:58,962
Adds upto 1-1 .5 laks,
count that too.

952
01:05:59,102 --> 01:06:01,366
lf you are adding that, then
add the 80-90 thousand..

953
01:06:01,437 --> 01:06:04,895
..the money that l spent
on your merriment.

954
01:06:04,974 --> 01:06:08,637
You are so cheap. You have
shown your true colors.

955
01:06:08,745 --> 01:06:10,474
You are not talking
of majestic yourself.

956
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:11,638
You are the son of a cheapskate.

957
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:14,249
You called me the son
of a cheapskate!

958
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:16,718
You pushed me!

959
01:06:17,887 --> 01:06:19,548
You friends are fighting
amongst yourself.

960
01:06:19,656 --> 01:06:20,714
To hell with friendship!

961
01:06:20,857 --> 01:06:23,519
Yes, to hell with friendship!

962
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:27,991
Hit him Manav, hit him!

963
01:06:29,132 --> 01:06:33,865

01:06:35,538 --> 01:06:37,529
You foolish boxer, can`t you see!

What are you all doing?

966
01:06:41,844 --> 01:06:43,368
Sit down and decide calmly!

967
01:06:43,479 --> 01:06:44,537
lt has been decided!

968
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:45,943
One who reaches Goa first,
the money is his.

969
01:06:46,582 --> 01:06:49,915
How can you reach Goa, will you fly.

970
01:06:50,019 --> 01:06:52,886
l made your fathers car fly,
did you forget that.

971
01:06:53,022 --> 01:06:54,489
Keep quiet! What is it?

972

He is fleeing with my jeep.

974
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:11,231
The inspector has fled too.

Manav, sit.

980
01:07:38,468 --> 01:07:40,459
Fool, sit here, sit here.

981
01:07:41,804 --> 01:07:42,862
Quickly.

982
01:07:44,006 --> 01:07:45,940

Adi, at what cost?
- Keep quiet!

Do you think it is your

Give me a ticket to Goa, hurry up.

01:17:15,511 --> 01:17:20,175
l don`t give tickets, l send
people on the final journey.

1083
01:17:24,787 --> 01:17:27,779
He is not the conductor,
he is a dacoit.

1084
01:17:28,457 --> 01:17:29,651
This bus has been hijacked.

1085
01:17:34,463 --> 01:17:37,523
Lift, lift, lift.

The door came in my hands.

No matter, hold it and sit.

l can`t understand
what has happened?

1099
01:18:31,587 --> 01:18:32,986
The keyhole, right there.

1100
01:18:50,139 --> 01:18:52,664
Did you stop the car to give
us a lift or to torture us?

1101
01:18:52,741 --> 01:18:56,404
God. - Why you, why are you
troubling this corpse.

1102
01:18:56,512 --> 01:19:00,448
lts capable of going in the pier
and not on wheels. - O God!

1103
01:19:00,549 --> 01:19:03,950
What O God, it doesn`t work at all.

1104
01:19:04,086 --> 01:19:05,178
Come on Manav, get out.

1105
01:19:07,823 --> 01:19:09,415
Sell this car, add some more money..

1106
01:19:09,491 --> 01:19:11,425
..and buy a pair of roller skates..

1107
01:19:11,493 --> 01:19:13,427
..the one`s that Hrithik
Roshan had in `Dhoom`.

1108
01:19:13,495 --> 01:19:14,894
Yes, at least they will work!

1109
01:19:14,997 --> 01:19:16,464
You wander around with a scrap car..

1110
01:19:16,565 --> 01:19:19,500
..and then you call people
to trouble them.

1111
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:21,967
To hell with you, l don`t
want to go to Goa with you!

1112
01:19:28,243 --> 01:19:29,710
Brother, Goa, Goa.

1113
01:19:29,778 --> 01:19:31,370
You scoundrel!

1114
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,005
You scoundrel!
How dare you abuse me?

1115
01:19:34,116 --> 01:19:36,050
My mother told me not
to fight with anyone.

1116
01:19:36,185 --> 01:19:39,120
You abused me.
You called me fish curry.

1117
01:19:39,455 --> 01:19:43,050
You, your entire
family is a fish curry.

1118
01:19:43,192 --> 01:19:44,250
Your car will
have an accident.

1119
01:19:44,526 --> 01:19:47,051
Yes, you will have
dysentery eating fish curry.

1120
01:19:47,596 --> 01:19:48,927
Come on, we will have
to look for more cars.

1121
01:19:50,466 --> 01:19:52,525
How many times have l told you
l am not a police personnel..

1122
01:19:52,634 --> 01:19:53,692
..my name is Deshbandhu Roy..

1123
01:19:53,802 --> 01:19:56,737
..l came in this bus to take a lift.

1124
01:19:56,872 --> 01:20:01,070
Another name for terror
is Babu-brother.

1125
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:05,403
2 years and 20 robberies,
still no one knows..

1126
01:20:05,481 --> 01:20:07,415
..who l am and what do l do?

1127
01:20:07,516 --> 01:20:10,713
Did you understand? Did
you understand who l am?

1128
01:20:10,819 --> 01:20:12,480
You are Babu-brother, you have
committed 20 robberies..

1129
01:20:12,621 --> 01:20:14,282
..in 2 years, and your
another name is terror.

1130
01:20:14,823 --> 01:20:18,486
How did you know, how
did you know who l am?

1131
01:20:18,627 --> 01:20:19,958
Who is that traitor?

1132
01:20:20,429 --> 01:20:22,897
Who is that traitor that
has escaped my sight!

1133
01:20:22,998 --> 01:20:24,056
Who is he?

1134
01:20:24,166 --> 01:20:25,497
Brother, you are suspecting
me again.

1135
01:20:25,634 --> 01:20:31,038
l will deal with you later,
first search this boy.

1136
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:35,568

1137
01:20:35,711 --> 01:20:36,837

lnspector Kabir Naik.

1140
01:20:49,725 --> 01:20:51,590
You dare salute an police personnel.

1141
01:20:51,727 --> 01:20:53,592
Why are you sitting here, go there.

1142
01:20:58,467 --> 01:21:00,458
There is no photo on the card..

1143
01:21:00,569 --> 01:21:03,629
..seems like he is an
underwear officer.

1144
01:21:03,739 --> 01:21:07,470
Babu-brother, undercover officer
not underwear officer.

1145
01:21:07,609 --> 01:21:08,735
You dare teach Babu-brother English.

1146
01:21:08,877 --> 01:21:10,811
Tie him up and put him in the back!

1147
01:21:13,215 --> 01:21:14,739
Don`t cry! Don`t cry!

1148
01:21:17,553 --> 01:21:18,747
Don`t cry!

1149
01:21:23,692 --> 01:21:26,092
Stop crying, or else l will
throw you on the road!

1150
01:21:28,697 --> 01:21:31,097
Good boys don`t cry.

1151
01:21:31,233 --> 01:21:33,963
Look. Let me reach Goa once.

1152
01:21:34,102 --> 01:21:36,127
lt is a question of 100 million.

1153

10 million from it.

l will give you 30 million.

1158

How much do you want?
- 100 million.

1159
01:22:03,665 --> 01:22:04,723
100 million.

1160
01:22:10,806 --> 01:22:13,604
Mate, mate we want to go to
Goa, is there any flight?

1161
01:22:13,675 --> 01:22:16,872
You are late sir, the last flight

Okay, okay there might

01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:20,047
Sorry sir, there is no
flight till tomorrow.

1164
01:22:20,148 --> 01:22:22,480
There might be a private plane.
- No sir.

01:22:22,618 --> 01:22:24,552
None, O God.

1166

Dear Dad, there!

1167
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:29,548
What are you saying, there is
a private plane standing.

1168
01:22:30,025 --> 01:22:32,960
The plane is standing, but
the pilot is lying down.

1169
01:22:33,095 --> 01:22:35,962
Lying down! Where is he
lying down? With whom?

Move! Get up.
- Driver, Driver.

1172
01:22:43,105 --> 01:22:45,437
He seems to be the brother
of Kumbhkaran!

1173
01:22:45,574 --> 01:22:48,236
Driver!
- He will not get up like that..

1174
01:22:48,443 --> 01:22:49,501
..l will arrange something
to wake him up.

1175
01:22:49,645 --> 01:22:52,773
Driver! Mr. Driver!

1176

1181
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:18,136

1182
01:23:20,475 --> 01:23:27,005
Sir please don`t say no, my
mother is in the hospital..

1183
01:23:27,149 --> 01:23:29,140
..in the hospital of Goa.

01:23:29,885 --> 01:23:34,879
Please come sir, you are under
the oath of your mother.

1185
01:23:38,827 --> 01:23:40,488
Mother.
- Mother.

1186
01:23:40,762 --> 01:23:43,424
The mother that left me
after giving me birth..

1187
01:23:43,565 --> 01:23:45,032
..you are giving me her oath.

1188
01:23:45,467 --> 01:23:48,732
Keep your.. mother`s
oath to yourself!

1189
01:23:48,837 --> 01:23:51,431
Not mother, he gave the
oath of your uncle.

1190
01:23:51,573 --> 01:23:53,234
Uncle`s oath!

1191
01:23:54,643 --> 01:23:55,701
l will kill you!

1192
01:23:55,977 --> 01:23:59,504
My uncle was crueller
than Dracula and Satan.

1193
01:23:59,981 --> 01:24:02,449
He never gave me anything
other than abuses to eat..

1194
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:04,518
..and water to drink.

1195
01:24:04,653 --> 01:24:07,588
And you are giving me the
oath of such an uncle.

1196
01:24:07,723 --> 01:24:11,523
Of the father, we gave you
the oath of your father.

1197
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,259
Don`t give me my father`s oath.

1198
01:24:13,929 --> 01:24:15,521
Don`t give me my father`s oath.

1199
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:18,798
Because l still don`t
know who my father is.

1200
01:24:20,035 --> 01:24:22,697
My cheap father made my mother
a mother and left..

1201
01:24:22,804 --> 01:24:23,862
..do you know that?

1202
01:24:24,005 --> 01:24:26,940
Made her a mother.

1203
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:34,481
Once l find him, l will chop
his.. l will chop his..

1204
01:24:35,751 --> 01:24:36,809
Legs!

1205
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:44,688
Sir, can we give you the
oath of your this?

1206
01:24:45,761 --> 01:24:49,697
What did you do?
- What happened?

1207
01:24:49,831 --> 01:24:52,766
This oath can persuade
me to go to hell too.

1208
01:24:53,235 --> 01:24:56,568
Tell me friends, where do
you want to go? - Goa!

1209
01:24:59,574 --> 01:25:01,769

You get lost.

1227
01:25:57,032 --> 01:26:01,560
Sorry, we didn`t know
that bike was not yours.

1228
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:03,399
That bike was not mine you hit me
if that bike would have been mine..

But l.. - You are arguing with me!
You are arguing with me!

1233
01:26:13,882 --> 01:26:14,940
You are trying to teach me.

1234
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:16,449
Because of you we missed that bike.

1235
01:26:16,585 --> 01:26:18,576
lf we had that bike, we would
have reached Goa soon.

1236
01:26:18,787 --> 01:26:21,722
Because of you we hit the man in the
jacket. He was a respectable man..

1237
01:26:21,823 --> 01:26:26,419
Adi! Adi! - Look here, l
am looking like a fool.

1238
01:26:26,528 --> 01:26:28,860
That man in the night dress
sat on the bike and left.

1239
01:26:28,997 --> 01:26:31,124
No Adi, Adi!

1240

You were saying Adi, Adi couldn`t
you say car, car.

Stop it, stop crying!

1244
01:26:58,026 --> 01:26:59,084
Quiet, come here.

1245
01:27:07,435 --> 01:27:11,565
The students have
ruined the country.

1246
01:27:11,706 --> 01:27:13,503
There is a lot of corruption.

1247
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:19,508
Take it out! Take it out!

What is this?

1251
01:27:35,797 --> 01:27:37,196
This is a gun, hands up.

1252
01:27:38,199 --> 01:27:39,666
Lower your guns.

1253
01:27:41,069 --> 01:27:43,469

No one will say anything!
No one will say anything!

l will do it, Who can
stop me! Will you?

Cheap dacoit, you can`t

1271
01:28:38,593 --> 01:28:40,060
..and you want to rob a bus.

1272
01:28:40,395 --> 01:28:42,386
Your size is that of a bullet..

1273
01:28:42,464 --> 01:28:44,591
..aren`t you ashamed
to pickup the bullet.

1274
01:28:44,699 --> 01:28:47,429
l hang people like you on
the threshold of my house..

1275
01:28:47,535 --> 01:28:49,127
..along with 5 green chilies.

1276
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:50,532
Did you understand?

1277
01:28:50,872 --> 01:28:52,806
Brother, he is calling you a lemon.

1278
01:28:52,941 --> 01:28:54,932

Hey, stop.

Tie people up properly.

01:29:35,050 --> 01:29:36,108
..isn`t it babu-brother.
- Yes.

Catch him, don`t let him escape.

1286
01:29:43,124 --> 01:29:45,149
How can he escape!

1287
01:29:53,735 --> 01:29:55,464
Neither is this car worth driving..

1288
01:29:55,603 --> 01:29:57,594
..nor are you worthy
of taking anywhere.

1289
01:30:06,281 --> 01:30:07,805
My arrangement has been made.

You are so nice..

1301

You will get us killed,

Shut up! You shut up!

1312
01:31:44,179 --> 01:31:45,441
Brother. Mr. Pilot.

1313
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:46,638
Pilot sir.

1314
01:31:51,986 --> 01:31:53,783
You made him emotional again.

1315
01:31:54,255 --> 01:31:56,052
What was the need to play the song?

1316
01:32:05,667 --> 01:32:08,067
He is drinking alcohol again..

1317
01:32:08,203 --> 01:32:10,535
..all this has happened
because of you, useless!

1318

God!
- O Lord!

1319
01:32:28,957 --> 01:32:30,788
Pilot sir..

1320
01:32:33,761 --> 01:32:35,092
Boman.
- Yes.

1321
01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:38,131
The pilot is unconscious.
- What? - Yes!

1322
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,578
Saved.

1323
01:33:17,872 --> 01:33:21,535
Seems like they left.
- Yes, they left.

1324
01:33:37,825 --> 01:33:39,793
He ran away.
- He ran away.

1325
01:33:40,561 --> 01:33:42,495
What are you laughing at, catch him!

1326

Keep quiet, you don`t
even let us sleep!

1333
01:34:20,468 --> 01:34:22,402
Someone put a tape on his mouth.

1334
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:24,870
lt is of no use, he
sings from the nose.

1335
01:34:24,939 --> 01:34:26,133
Then break his nose.

1336
01:34:26,207 --> 01:34:27,333
Go break it.

1337
01:34:27,442 --> 01:34:30,434
Thrash him! Thrash him!

Hello! Can anybody hear
my voice, hello!

01:35:21,996 --> 01:35:24,055
Not you fool!

1346
01:35:24,198 --> 01:35:26,860
Hello! Hello!

1347
01:35:27,035 --> 01:35:28,366
Hello.

1348
01:35:28,469 --> 01:35:35,932
Hello.
- Hello! Hello! Hello!

1349
01:35:36,077 --> 01:35:40,537
Hello, l am Dev Kumar Malik.

1350
01:35:40,882 --> 01:35:45,876
D. K. Malik. Welcome
to Goa flying club.

1351
01:35:46,421 --> 01:35:53,486
l am always available here
24 hours for any emergency.

1352
01:35:53,561 --> 01:35:56,621
They appoint anyone for
the emergency services..

1353
01:35:56,697 --> 01:35:57,959
..he is so slow.

1354
01:35:58,032 --> 01:36:02,833
You just tell me, what
is your problem?

1355
01:36:02,937 --> 01:36:05,405
Our problem is we are
on a private plane..

1356
01:36:05,506 --> 01:36:07,440
..and the pilot is unconscious!

1357
01:36:07,575 --> 01:36:08,633
What should we do?

1358
01:36:09,177 --> 01:36:11,509
Then who is flying the plane?

1359
01:36:11,646 --> 01:36:13,580
l am flying it. Boman! Boman!

1360
01:36:14,048 --> 01:36:15,640
Yes than Boman, Boman.

1361
01:36:15,783 --> 01:36:17,250
My name is just Boman once.

1362
01:36:17,585 --> 01:36:22,716
So Boman just once, have you
ever flown a plane before.

1363
01:36:22,857 --> 01:36:26,520
He has never even swatted
a fly before..

1364
01:36:28,129 --> 01:36:35,001
Before landing the plane, we should
know about flying the plane.

1365
01:36:35,603 --> 01:36:39,596
And before knowing how to fly,
we should know about the plane.

1366
01:36:40,408 --> 01:36:44,401
The plane that you are
flying right now..

1367
01:36:44,545 --> 01:36:48,879
..it weighs 2084 kilos
and 300 grams.

1368
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:52,415
lt`s technology is comprised
of two computers..

1369
01:36:52,553 --> 01:36:56,546
..and two pilots control,
it is a private plane.

1370
01:36:57,425 --> 01:37:01,088
Two engines, two propellers
and three wheels.

1371
01:37:01,195 --> 01:37:03,527
How do we get down?

1372
01:37:03,631 --> 01:37:07,431
There are two doors at the back
and one emergency door..

1373
01:37:07,568 --> 01:37:08,899
..in the cockpit to get down.

1374
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:13,501
And on top of that, that`s
almost everything.

1375
01:37:15,176 --> 01:37:16,973
We should save uncle.

1376
01:37:17,111 --> 01:37:19,579
He is not even our driver.

1377
01:37:19,647 --> 01:37:22,377
So what, he is in this situation
because of us.

1378
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:24,042
But why should we listen to you?

1379
01:37:24,152 --> 01:37:25,813
Because l have all the chocolates.

1380
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,046
Then we will have to save him.

1381
01:37:27,188 --> 01:37:29,588
Come on, come on let us save
him. l will get the rope.

1382
01:37:34,662 --> 01:37:39,395
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1383
01:37:39,534 --> 01:37:43,197
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1384
01:37:44,872 --> 01:37:48,399
Uncle, catch the rope and come up!

1385
01:37:48,543 --> 01:37:50,738
We have tied the rope to the bus!

1386
01:38:02,557 --> 01:38:06,015
Come on uncle, come on!

1387
01:38:16,504 --> 01:38:20,964
Uncle.

1388
01:38:23,878 --> 01:38:27,405
Uncle, save us! Uncle, save us!

1389
01:38:27,515 --> 01:38:30,450
What did you think, l was really
in the hanging garden..

1390
01:38:30,585 --> 01:38:33,053
..that you came down here
to play on the swings.

1391
01:38:33,187 --> 01:38:35,246
Uncle, save us! Uncle, save us!
- Quiet!

1392
01:38:35,590 --> 01:38:40,459
Stop your nonsense, and quickly
tell us how to land.

1393
01:38:40,595 --> 01:38:43,530
Haste makes waste.

1394
01:38:43,798 --> 01:38:46,062
Humans should have patience.

1395
01:38:46,267 --> 01:38:50,067
Take a look right in front of you.

1396
01:38:50,671 --> 01:38:53,663
What can you see?
- Death!

1397
01:38:53,808 --> 01:38:55,275
No, no before death.

1398
01:38:55,810 --> 01:38:58,540
ls there a big round wheel
in front of you?

1399
01:38:58,679 --> 01:39:00,476
Yes, there is.

1400
01:39:00,615 --> 01:39:03,083
There is a red button on
the side of the wheel.

1401
01:39:04,085 --> 01:39:07,543
l have pressed it, what next.

1402
01:39:08,155 --> 01:39:09,554
You shouldn`t have pressed it.

1403
01:39:10,891 --> 01:39:14,884
Pressing that button shuts
off the main engine.

1404
01:39:17,298 --> 01:39:19,630
Useless, you don`t
even hear properly.

1405
01:39:20,568 --> 01:39:24,504
Now that main thing is that,
your main engine is off..

1406
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:26,163
..and your other engine is shoddy.

1407
01:39:27,475 --> 01:39:29,807
Thank God.

1408
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:31,434
No, no l mean your other
engine is cheap..

1409
01:39:31,579 --> 01:39:33,103
..it is not company made.

1410
01:39:33,581 --> 01:39:35,173
lt is a very cheap quality.

1411
01:39:37,251 --> 01:39:39,617
lt is on right now, that
means it is working.

1412
01:39:40,254 --> 01:39:43,223
But how long will it work, there
is no guarantee of that.

1413
01:39:43,591 --> 01:39:45,786
Oh Lord!
- Dad.

1414
01:39:45,926 --> 01:39:47,860
Look ahead!

1415
01:40:02,109 --> 01:40:03,269
No uncle, don`t leave me.

1416
01:40:03,477 --> 01:40:05,468
Children, you wait here l
will make arrangements..

1417
01:40:05,613 --> 01:40:07,205
..to save you.

1418
01:40:07,515 --> 01:40:09,983
No, no uncle l will
come along with you.

1419
01:40:10,117 --> 01:40:11,812
Okay.
- And what about us?

1420
01:40:12,119 --> 01:40:15,054
You both come later, ladies
first! Ladies first.

1421
01:40:15,189 --> 01:40:18,090
Come on brother.
- Brother! Come on mother.

1422
01:40:18,826 --> 01:40:21,590
Uncle!..

1423
01:40:25,566 --> 01:40:27,158
Uncle, come soon! Uncle, please.

1424
01:40:35,142 --> 01:40:37,007
Uncle, please save us. Please..

1425
01:40:37,144 --> 01:40:41,843
..Save us! Uncle. Uncle!

1426
01:40:42,116 --> 01:40:47,247
Uncle, please save us.

1427
01:41:02,603 --> 01:41:03,695
Uncle!

1428
01:41:11,145 --> 01:41:12,612
Uncle!

1429
01:41:14,115 --> 01:41:15,548
Uncle!

1430
01:41:16,016 --> 01:41:21,682
Uncle!

1431
01:41:24,125 --> 01:41:27,686
- Quiet Save.. !Quiet!

1432
01:41:28,129 --> 01:41:30,927
l have come to save you,
not to play cricket.

1433
01:41:36,837 --> 01:41:39,635
Have courage, have patience.

1434
01:41:39,774 --> 01:41:42,072
And at least stay calm.

1435
01:41:42,209 --> 01:41:44,507
We don`t have time to keep anything!

1436
01:41:44,779 --> 01:41:47,247
Okay, now do one thing.

1437
01:41:47,782 --> 01:41:49,807
See the indication
on the fuel meter.

1438
01:41:53,187 --> 01:41:55,519
Thank God, the right
light is on here.

1439
01:41:58,159 --> 01:42:00,923
That means your fuel is
about to end too. - What?

1440
01:42:01,529 --> 01:42:02,587
What should l do know?

1441
01:42:03,164 --> 01:42:05,860
Now repeat after me.
- What?

1442
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,532
Lord, all the sins that
l have committed.

1443
01:42:08,702 --> 01:42:11,068
Lord, all the sins that
l have committed.

1444
01:42:11,539 --> 01:42:13,905
Please forgive it.
- Please forgive it!

1445
01:42:14,542 --> 01:42:15,975
We are coming in your shelter.

1446
01:42:16,177 --> 01:42:18,509
We are coming in your.. quiet!

1447
01:42:18,612 --> 01:42:21,479
We don`t want to die,
we don`t want to die!

1448
01:42:21,615 --> 01:42:25,551
Whether you want or not, everyone
has to die one day.

1449
01:42:26,253 --> 01:42:30,485
Because death is a truth that
can never stay away from us.

1450
01:42:31,125 --> 01:42:36,495
Human is unaware, and death
comes closer every moment.

1451
01:42:37,064 --> 01:42:39,498
And suddenly, it comes very close.

1452
01:42:39,834 --> 01:42:42,064
Sir, death has come
close to us too!

1453
01:42:46,507 --> 01:42:49,203
Stop! Stop! Stop
- Stop! Please.

01:42:49,844 --> 01:42:51,937

1458
01:43:06,794 --> 01:43:08,523

1459
01:43:09,196 --> 01:43:11,596
We will reach as we finish
introducing our names.

1460

He is from Sholay.

1609
01:53:57,511 --> 01:53:58,876
Are you searching for
the W or playing games.

1610
01:54:00,046 --> 01:54:03,447

..let us look for V.

1612
01:54:06,086 --> 01:54:07,144
Why should we look for V.

1613
01:54:07,487 --> 01:54:09,512
Actually V comes before W.

01:54:27,541 --> 01:54:30,635
Gardener, looks like
a dacoit Mahakali.

01:54:56,836 --> 01:54:58,565
Who is he?

1623
01:55:01,508 --> 01:55:03,908
Who is he?
- Manav.

1624
01:55:06,513 --> 01:55:09,243
And who is he?

So many people, but which
one is W amongst them.

01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:27,032
Why you.. quiet.

1628
01:55:32,439 --> 01:55:35,567
Hello, all of us know
that we are here.

1629
01:55:35,709 --> 01:55:37,677
And so there is no use of hiding.

1630
01:55:41,815 --> 01:55:43,112
Nari uncle, come out!

1631
01:55:49,823 --> 01:55:50,881
What are you doing
with the gardener?

1632
01:55:52,025 --> 01:55:54,687
He is not a gardener, he
is a dacoit. - Dacoit!

1633
01:55:54,828 --> 01:55:56,819
You scoundrels reached
here after all.

1634
01:55:57,097 --> 01:55:59,497
Not just us, four scoundrels!
You are along with us too.

1635
01:56:00,767 --> 01:56:03,167
Stop Guys. There is no use
fighting amongst ourselves.

1636
01:56:03,503 --> 01:56:04,834
Adi, Roy is absolutely right.

1637
01:56:05,038 --> 01:56:06,505
There is no use fighting
amongst ourselves.

1638
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:08,574
You fight with Roy and l
will fight with Boman.

1639
01:56:09,843 --> 01:56:11,606
stop..
- Shut up!

1640
01:56:12,178 --> 01:56:14,510
All of us know, no matter
who finds the W..

1641
01:56:14,614 --> 01:56:15,945
..you cannot take the money alone.

1642
01:56:16,049 --> 01:56:17,641
Can he take?
- No..

1643
01:56:17,784 --> 01:56:20,252
So it is better that we search
for the W together..

1644
01:56:20,487 --> 01:56:22,978
..and divide the money equally.
- Yes that`s right.

1645
01:56:23,123 --> 01:56:24,181
Come on, let us look for the W.

1646
01:56:24,858 --> 01:56:26,553
Where can the W be?

1647
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:27,918
lt must be around here somewhere.

1648
01:56:28,461 --> 01:56:29,519
He said it was a big W.

1649
01:56:29,796 --> 01:56:31,525
We are not such big fools..

1650
01:56:31,798 --> 01:56:33,925
..that we will miss the
W right in front of us.

1651
01:56:34,734 --> 01:56:36,463
He is also very smart.

1652
01:56:36,703 --> 01:56:38,068
You are all wasting time.

1653
01:56:38,538 --> 01:56:39,596
Roy, both of you go to that side.

1654
01:56:39,939 --> 01:56:41,702
Boman, you both go to that side.
- Okay. You come with me.

1655
01:56:41,808 --> 01:56:44,971
Go.. We have to look for W!

1656
01:56:45,111 --> 01:56:48,706
W! W!.. Oh no, do

1657
01:56:49,816 --> 01:56:52,614
What will you do with it,
the crow has flown away.

1658
01:56:57,957 --> 01:57:01,791
Oh shit.
- lt is crow shit.

1659
01:57:02,629 --> 01:57:03,994
Oh shit!

1660
01:57:05,765 --> 01:57:06,823

Congratulations,
you have found the W.

1668
01:57:56,049 --> 01:58:01,885
Who is he now?
- Ask him yourself.

1669
01:58:02,489 --> 01:58:05,549
Who are you? Prime Minister

1670
01:58:13,767 --> 01:58:17,999
Since l met you, my terror is over.

1671
01:58:18,705 --> 01:58:19,831
Does anyone else want
to say anything?

1672
01:58:21,441 --> 01:58:24,933
Look inspector sir, we won`t
let you take the money alone.

1673
01:58:25,078 --> 01:58:29,105
No ways.
- He was right.. - Who said?

1674
01:58:29,582 --> 01:58:31,243
l am saying, let us
take the money out..

1675
01:58:31,451 --> 01:58:32,509
..and divide it equally.

1676
01:58:32,652 --> 01:58:35,246
That`s right. No, no l will dig
it. Don`t take the trouble.. Give..

1677
01:58:35,722 --> 01:58:40,455
..No, no the mobile. Oh the mobile,

Babu-brother, give me your hand.
- Come on.

1693
01:59:38,852 --> 01:59:40,251
lf you dig it, you will
get the money.

1694
01:59:41,654 --> 01:59:42,985
Come on, dig.

1695
01:59:43,122 --> 01:59:46,023
Yes come on, Boman. 100 million.

1696
01:59:46,526 --> 01:59:49,689
Hey you get out.

1697
01:59:49,863 --> 01:59:51,831
Hey, talk to me with respect.

1698
01:59:52,031 --> 01:59:54,090
Babu-brother is another
name for terror..

1699
01:59:54,234 --> 01:59:55,792
..Hey you terrorist, come out.

1700
01:59:56,102 --> 01:59:57,160
Coming.

1701
02:00:10,550 --> 02:00:14,145
l have found it! l have Found it!

1702
02:00:20,126 --> 02:00:21,184
The lid.

1703
02:00:25,565 --> 02:00:26,998
Bag! - Lift it.

1704
02:00:48,721 --> 02:00:52,589
Come on, let us divide the
money quickly - Yes!..

1705
02:00:52,725 --> 02:00:55,922
One share for Nari.
- Thank you.

1706
02:00:56,529 --> 02:00:57,587
One share for Boman.

1707
02:00:58,531 --> 02:00:59,725
And one share for Adi Manav.

1708
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:01,658
Just a minute.

1709
02:01:01,801 --> 02:01:03,860
What do you mean by one share?
Both of you are the same unit.

1710
02:01:04,470 --> 02:01:07,132
- Yes! They are same unit!

1711
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:10,676
We are not giving a unit test. lt
is not so easy. We are two units.

1712
02:01:10,810 --> 02:01:13,005
And Bomans car that
you had wrecked..

1713
02:01:13,146 --> 02:01:14,807
..you will pay for
that too, wont you.

1714
02:01:14,914 --> 02:01:17,508
The car is Boman`s father
and not Boman`s.

1715
02:01:17,617 --> 02:01:19,482
l want that money.

1716
02:01:19,619 --> 02:01:21,143
Uncle, take that money
from Boman`s share.

1717
02:01:22,021 --> 02:01:23,682
You had wrecked the car why
should l alone pay for it?

1718
02:01:23,890 --> 02:01:25,482
Then who will pay for
it, it is your car?

1719
02:01:25,625 --> 02:01:26,956
You three will pay for it, who else.

1720
02:01:28,962 --> 02:01:31,362
Just a minute, why will Adi
Manav pay for the car..

1721
02:01:31,464 --> 02:01:34,399
..from their single share.
That`s injustice. Not fair.

1722
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:36,695
Why are you saying just one
share, we are two people.

1723
02:01:36,836 --> 02:01:38,861
Have you come in the wedding
ceremony that you want two shares!

1724
02:01:39,505 --> 02:01:42,167
First keep my share
out and then say.

1725
02:01:42,508 --> 02:01:43,566
The city has still not
been established..

1726
02:01:43,710 --> 02:01:45,200
..and the beggars have
already encroached it.

1727
02:01:45,778 --> 02:01:47,678
Roy has made a deal
of 50-50 with him.

1728
02:01:48,514 --> 02:01:51,142
50-50, is this your fathers money
that you have made this deal.

1729
02:01:53,453 --> 02:01:54,784
Don`t you dare drag my father
into this!..

1730
02:01:54,854 --> 02:01:56,378
..We will drag your
mother into this!

1731
02:01:56,489 --> 02:01:57,751
K.G class keep quiet!turn

1732
02:01:57,857 --> 02:01:59,984
What can you do, cheap detective?
You coward, l will.

1733
02:02:00,093 --> 02:02:01,617
Your father is a coward!

1734
02:02:01,728 --> 02:02:05,027
Again father, Roy is not
a coward understood!

1735
02:02:05,131 --> 02:02:06,564
Yes, you drag my father in-between.

1736
02:02:06,699 --> 02:02:10,601
You! - Why did you hit my dad.

1737
