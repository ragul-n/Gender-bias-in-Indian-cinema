1
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,920
Dad, where do these tickets come from?
Are they from God?

2
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,040
No, from the machine

3
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,600
How did it get into the machine?

4
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,360
The person in charge
must have put it there

5
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,880
- Where did the tickets come from?
- From paper

6
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,440
- From where do we get paper?
- From the trees

7
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,680
- Where do trees come from?
- From God

8
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,240
So, these tickets do come from God

9
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,240
You're right! Shall we read
God's message to you

10
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,920
'Good fortune is round the corner'

11
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,840
'This is where it all started...'

12
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,560
'...the fairy tale of Sweety and
the messages from the machine'

13
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,520
'That's when her
inseparable bond with that

14
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,920
fortune- telling
weighing machine began'

15
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,800
Happiest girls only
beautiful girls

16
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,000
Happiest girls only
beautiful girls

17
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,560
Sharing is the real happy

18
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,040
We can win anything with smile

19
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,160
Dad!

20
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,600
Our loved ones never leave us
They're always with us

21
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,120
Love is waiting for you

22
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,040
Hey, Sweety has come

23
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,880
She is not Sweety
She is a 'fatty'

24
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,520
Please, God

25
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,920
You be yourself
That is beautiful

26
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,680
Little more
Hold your breath

27
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,760
Little more

28
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,200
Idiot, are you fastening the zip
or undoing it?

29
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,360
Pull it up

30
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,880
Hurry up

31
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,160
I can't brother

32
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,880
We measured your size less
than a week back...

33
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,160
...and you've already
gained 2 kilos

34
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,640
What do you do in the gym?

35
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,920
I'm sure even the treadmill
has worn out

36
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,680
But I don't see any
change in you

37
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,360
My weight is not the problem
It's the dress

38
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,040
You've learnt to give
smart answers

39
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,960
All your friends are happily married
and have their children clinging to them

40
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,280
But you are all grown- up
and still clinging on to me

41
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,280
I am not fat, mom...

42
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,720
I am full of health

43
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,400
Do you think only skinny
women get married?

44
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,920
I am sure my Prince Charming
will come for me

45
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,000
More importantly,
I am happy the way I am

46
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,960
Oh, God! She says
she is happy with herself

47
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,160
Do you think just being happy
will fetch you a good husband?

48
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,400
Don't worry, madam

49
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,760
Sweety will get a good NRI husband
(Non- resident Indian)

50
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,200
She doesn't stand a chance if she wears
the ill-fitting clothes you've made

51
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,440
Zip up your mouth and try
fastening the zip on her dress

52
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,920
Stop making small talk

53
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,320
Do you think a smaller dress
will make me look a size smaller?

54
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,720
It took me ages to get out of the dress
you made for 'Diwali'

55
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,240
Tuck your tummy in
and hold your breath

56
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,520
A little more...

57
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,040
Just a little more...

58
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,840
God, help us!

59
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,240
Don't you know what to say
in front of other people?

60
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,800
You embarrass me

61
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,520
How can I be blamed
for his shoddy work?

62
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,800
Stop talking

63
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,080
That's your phone ringing

64
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,160
Your brother, that monkey,
irritates me by messing with my phone

65
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,080
Hello

66
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,600
It's Rajeshwari IAS

67
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,560
Yes, I sell that product

68
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Tell me

69
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,040
The small one is Rs 100
and the big one Rs 150

70
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,080
A discount?

71
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,200
I can't give a discount every other day

72
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,040
There will be plenty of offers
during the festival season

73
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,720
Call me on the same number

74
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,200
What is 'IAS'?

75
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Independent Agent Sales

76
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,040
God save you!

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,840
Move! I don't have
enough space

78
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,800
If you take the whole seat,
where will I sit?

79
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,920
Wait

80
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,520
Oh, Goddess!
Divine Mother

81
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,000
Stop...stop

82
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,000
Greetings to you, revered one

83
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,400
If you can't catch this, how will you
get a 'good catch' for your daughter

84
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
How are you Rajeshwari?

85
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,680
What about your daughter's marriage?

86
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,040
That's my only worry in life

87
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,080
I know

88
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,560
I just spoke to the planets
about Sweety's birth chart

89
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,920
What did they say?

90
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,960
Mars is in a very inauspicious
position in her birth chart

91
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,080
If she doesn't get married this
year, she never will

92
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,000
She will remain a spinster

93
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,080
Is there any remedy for this?

94
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,080
Find a black cow with a white birthmark
or a white one with a black birthmark...

95
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,880
...and worship it for six weeks

96
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,160
Where can I find such a cow?

97
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Where can I find one
that has birthmarks?

98
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,600
How do you expect answers
without doing the work?

99
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,680
Why don't you take my place?

100
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,680
I will look around and
fetch a cow for you

101
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,520
No I am not
talk anything

102
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,000
After six weeks of this ritual,
surrender yourself at my feet

103
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,880
Things will fall in place

104
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,760
After six weeks, you can swindle us
and take the cow away

105
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,600
Don't talk nonsense

106
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,720
She speaks out of ignorance

107
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,560
Good

108
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,840
If you had a girl,
you could have got her married

109
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,080
But she is an inflated tube
Throw her into the pool

110
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,720
She will never get married
Go, pray to the cow

111
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,360
Salute him

112
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Is it so hard to pay
respects to me?

113
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,840
Don't you want to get married?

114
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,240
Please forgive her

115
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,840
Okay swami

116
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,040
I've told you to cover your
face while going out

117
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,400
You will tan

118
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,680
Remember? If you
don't get married...

119
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,000
...this year, you will
die a virgin

120
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,080
If your worry is about me dying a virgin,
I've plenty of solutions for that

121
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,400
You wretched girl!
Is this how you talk to your mom?

122
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,720
Your job is to ensure
she exercises

123
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,600
I'll monitor that

124
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,880
Meanwhile, can you ask the Saint
about a way to lose my virginity?

125
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,240
Wait till you can be
called an adult

126
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,800
See what I do when
you come back

127
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,120
Would you like to eat now?

128
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:28,560
After the month's expenses,
we have Rs 20,453 in hand

129
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,680
If we have to run the
house smoothly...

130
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,280
...we have to sell a few things
kept in the storage room

131
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,200
Let's eat

132
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,960
Down

133
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,920
Up

134
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,360
Down

135
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,280
Only your face is getting a workout
How about moving the rest of your body

136
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,600
Will you shake your hip
Will it work out

137
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,600
Down

138
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,680
Up

139
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,960
Down

140
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,040
Up

141
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,200
Left
Right

142
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,320
- Hey baby
- Go naughty

143
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,600
Thank you

144
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,800
I haven't seen you at
the gym for a while

145
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,760
I did a detailed research
on inner wear

146
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,320
Did you find something new?

147
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,120
I have plenty of new ideas

148
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,600
Take a seat

149
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:34,200
Take a look at this
Sensual and roomy but expensive

150
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,320
Is that all?
Don't you have other styles?

151
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,120
I have international brands

152
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,440
It is not made of fabric
but is of a special material

153
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,840
Do you like it?

154
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,960
I can find this
even in the local market

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,200
Can't you show something
more exciting?

156
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,520
How can I show you exciting stuff?

157
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,480
My friend bought something
interesting from Thailand

158
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,720
It has lights on them

159
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Won't you get an
electrical shock?

160
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,840
Rubbish! The lights gave her
a double bonanza!

161
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
She has twins now

162
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,440
The shock would have
killed the husband instantly

163
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,400
God! You're bigger
than this bed

164
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,000
Who is exercising here?
Is it you or her?

165
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,080
Scumbag!

166
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,680
If you dare tell
mom about this...

167
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,760
I'll tell her about your
inner wear business

168
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,680
Don't call it the inner
wear business

169
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,520
Make it sound sophisticated
Call it the 'soft wear' business

170
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,360
Shit!

171
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,600
Are you in the software business?

172
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,040
It's the 'soft wear' business
Do you want to buy?

173
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,520
Idiot, get out

174
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,880
You continue the massage

175
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,400
'Size Zero' is stirring
up a storm in the city

176
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,000
The Head of the company,
Sathyanand...

177
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,120
...who runs Dubai's new and successful
weight loss program

178
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,200
...has his eyes set on
the Indian market

179
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,560
The 'Size Zero' promotional video has
the young and the old dancing to its tunes

180
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,720
Within an hour of release on YouTube,
it has been viewed ten lakh times

181
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,280
Total waste

182
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,080
Presenting that sensational video,
just for you...

183
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,160
"What did you say?"

184
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,280
"A fat girl can't get hitched?"

185
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,600
"A long winding route you may take,
but you'll get there, just you wait"

186
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,440
"You could come
from anywhere..."

187
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,040
"But just get your daughter
into that swanky place..."

188
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,880
"And she'll get offers
at a steady pace"

189
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,560
â€œLadies, come shake you bootiesâ€

190
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,960
â€œBabes, turn into hottiesâ€

191
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,480
â€œLadies, just start afreshâ€

192
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,120
â€œBabes, now just get hitchedâ€

193
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:56,640
"Oh yes! You will slim down!"
Oh yes! Slim and sexy like me!

194
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,240
"You'll reign 'Bollywood'
and 'Hollywood'..."

195
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,480
"You'll become a super star"

196
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,280
"From roly- poly you'll become
slim and svelte, girly..."

197
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,800
"A few sizes down...
Will make you look young"

198
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,320
"Zero zero
Size zero"

199
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:30,400
"You'll get flashboard abs
in the blink of your eye"

200
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,400
"Zero zero
Size zero"

201
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:40,160
"You'll turn a 'super model'
within the snap of a finger"

202
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,800
5 4 3 2 1
Go

203
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,600
Sorry

204
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,520
"No one falls for the one
with love handles"

205
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,640
"A cylindrical shape will make
boys want to escape"

206
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,000
"Hey! Mr Fatso, is there any
chair that's right for your size?"

207
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,320
"Wherever you go, for your size
you pay a heavy price"

208
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,080
"An extra large doorway and
an oversize car..."

209
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,320
"Even before you can caress,
she becomes your 'ex'"

210
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,760
â€œMini Mini girl
Attractive Priya Honeyâ€

211
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,960
â€œGet into minis
Do the Shimmy Shimmyâ€

212
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,640
â€œHurry Hurry Hurry
But don't you worryâ€

213
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,880
â€œWe'll make you ready now
Get in everybodyâ€

214
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,960
"Size zero"

215
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,480
"Get size zero"

216
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,320
"Get size zero"

217
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,920
"You don't have to swim
to slim down"

218
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,480
"You don't have to
workout to get shapely"

219
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,680
"You don't have to
exercise to turn sexy"

220
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,520
"Join us and that will do!"

221
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,360
5...4
Everybody

222
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,960
"Zero zero
Size zero"

223
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
"You'll get flashboard abs
in the blink of your eye"

224
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,440
"Zero zero
Size zero"

225
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:23,760
"You'll turn a 'super model'
within the snap of a finger"

226
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,840
We've closed admissions now
Come back for the next batch

227
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,320
Check this out
Rs 200,000 to reduce 20 kilos

228
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,320
It's a huge waste

229
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,560
I wouldn't need that kind of money
even to gain weight

230
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,080
We'll lose money,
but won't lose any weight

231
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,920
Stop it

232
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,680
Say you don't want to exert yourself
Don't blame it on the high costs

233
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,320
Don't pretend

234
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,000
The groom's family
is expected anytime

235
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,960
Hurry up

236
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,880
Where the hell is this boy?

237
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,960
Don't get tense

238
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,960
Let's grab the bridegroom this time

239
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,960
Why are you trying
to grab the 'laddu'?

240
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,160
You have Diabetes

241
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,880
You should be all right
till the wedding

242
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,080
Let us take another one

243
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,480
Wretched girls!

244
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,640
You've been chatting

245
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,600
Why haven't you
gone to the beauty parlour?

246
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,600
Lazy girls

247
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,600
Don't worry, aunty!

248
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,920
We'll go to the parlour
and get back in no time

249
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,920
Why should you come back?
You head back to your house

250
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,160
Poor mom, she feels the
groom might like you instead of me

251
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,120
Am I right, mom?

252
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,360
I wish you exercise
as much as you speak

253
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,640
You could lose weight

254
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,280
Like the price of gold,
your weight increases by the day

255
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,640
If I've to buy you a gold waist chain,
I might have to sell the house

256
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,920
Get ready

257
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,720
So, this is a tube top

258
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,360
It is nice

259
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,840
I am expecting the
groom's family any moment

260
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,800
Have you fixed the flush in the toilet?

261
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,520
Don't worry, I will fix it

262
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,360
Why are you sulking?

263
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,680
I sweep, mop, clean bathrooms
and do all the chores

264
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,480
She might lose weight
if she does some of it

265
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,760
You pay no heed to what I say

266
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,200
He isn't used to spicy food
He will get used to it

267
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,680
My brother and sister-in-law
couldn't make it here

268
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,280
Since Abhi is here on work,
Neeraja is looking for a bride for him

269
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,240
I don't think that monkey
fixed the flush

270
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,600
Let him get back home
I will put him in his place

271
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,520
There she is, your
future daughter-in-law

272
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,280
Take it

273
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,920
She looks beautiful despite being fat

274
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,560
This orange saree makes her look fat

275
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,360
Haven't I told you not
to wear this saree?

276
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,040
Be quiet

277
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,880
Sweety is the one adding beauty
to the colour she wears

278
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,040
The flush doesn't work, Abhi
Use a mug of water

279
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,880
It just broke down

280
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,760
Abhi is a nice boy
I have known him for long

281
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,600
He has no vices

282
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,160
Yes, he is looking great

283
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,240
I am not flattering her
because she is my daughter

284
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
Sweety is very talented

285
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,120
Son

286
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,720
She works as a manager
in an international hotel nearby

287
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,160
'My mom will lie through her teeth
to get me married'

288
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,000
'But some of it will be true'

289
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,320
I started my career at a five-star hotel

290
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,760
However, in five months,
the stars fell one by one

291
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,200
I now work at a
one-star restaurant nearby

292
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,000
You get the best drumstick chicken
in the city at Chungking Express

293
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,840
I've told her to stop working
after marriage

294
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,680
Haven't I?

295
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,160
Don't worry about cooking

296
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,280
When Sweety makes pasta for breakfast,
you can relish it the whole day

297
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,560
Only we've been talking

298
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,120
Why don't we allow the
two of them to talk?

299
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,120
That's right
Go, talk to each other

300
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,840
You go

301
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,200
They are a match made in heaven

302
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,760
They make a nice couple

303
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,840
I see a bright future for Sweety

304
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,280
India is lot of power cuts, right?

305
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,640
'I weigh 92 kilos'

306
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,920
'I face several health
problems because of this'

307
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,200
'Dieting hasn't helped
People tease me'

308
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,240
Where the hell is the remote?

309
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,880
'Presenting a magic belt
that gives results in a week'

310
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,520
Results in a week?

311
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,520
Is that a grinder or a belt?

312
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,280
I should try this sometime

313
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,880
I didn't mean you

314
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,080
I don't think you need that

315
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,840
That's for obese people

316
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,960
Look here

317
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,520
I don't have an hourglass figure

318
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,040
I don't know how to cook

319
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,640
When I'm bored
I smoke in the loo

320
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,240
When I don't feel good,
I have a drink on the terrace

321
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,320
Forget making an exotic pasta,
I can't cook an everyday meal

322
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,920
My blouse is three sizes smaller
and might give way anytime

323
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,840
I will come to the point

324
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,360
I am not interested
in marriage right now

325
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,240
What should we do?

326
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,880
Neither am I interested
in getting married now

327
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,680
I am here because
my parents insisted

328
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,560
Actually I am a documentary film maker

329
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,680
Super

330
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,760
So, you don't have a steady income
No wonder my weight wasn't a concern

331
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,080
You were probably counting on a
dowry that's as big as me

332
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,320
Sorry, your movie is a flop

333
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,080
I don't make movies
I make documentaries

334
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,840
I don't trust the movie guys much

335
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,960
I have no interest in your videos

336
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,800
Our family is waiting anxiously
for our announcement

337
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,240
That's more important

338
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,840
So, what do we do now?

339
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,480
Let's tell them that neither of us
is interested in this

340
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,600
Yes!
Okay!

341
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,880
I will tell them

342
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Wait!

343
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,880
I've never had the experience
of rejecting anyone

344
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,160
So, let me tell them

345
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,280
We are waiting for so long
Everything will be good

346
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,200
What do you say?

347
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,640
Everything will be good

348
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,360
Oh God! What happened to her?

349
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,360
I am not interested in this marriage

350
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,840
This is so unfair

351
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,640
What did I ask for?

352
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,720
You just had to make the groom
give his consent

353
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,040
How long will this go on?

354
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,040
My husband left me with two useless kids
and some worthless things

355
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,880
The way things are heading,
my daughter will also become worthless

356
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,560
Why did you do this?

357
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,720
Tell me

358
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,120
He's not some Superhero, he's a Saint

359
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,680
Get lost, you monkey!

360
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,520
I wasn't talking about you, God!

361
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,200
I have to get an NRI
groom in three months

362
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,680
It is your responsibility

363
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,440
Believe in
Happy Endings

364
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,440
- Hi Sweety!
- Hi!

365
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,120
Hi, baby doll!

366
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,480
What happened yesterday?

367
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,000
I said 'no' to the groom

368
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,280
Really!
Why?

369
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,720
Was he a bore?

370
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,560
Was he bald?
Short?

371
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,200
Don't you like dress sense?

372
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,240
What happened?
Tell me

373
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,080
Why aren't you saying anything?

374
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,080
There is something
different about you

375
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,960
Have you lost weight?

376
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Or is something wrong
with my eyesight?

377
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,600
'Size Zero' clinic does wonders

378
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,040
Why don't you join it and lose weight?

379
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,320
Chungking Express

380
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,720
How may I help you?

381
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,520
Chef 1 â€˜schezwan noodles with chickenâ€™

382
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,720
Okay, I'll make it

383
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,400
He is a regular here
He's lost his job

384
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,320
We'll cheer him up
with a fortune cookie

385
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,640
How may I help you?

386
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
No, thanks!

387
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,160
May I help you, sir?

388
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
One Yaka mein Noodles

389
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,160
You need to be dealt with

390
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,960
Hurry up, Abhi
We are late

391
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,680
Hi aunty!
How are you?

392
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,920
How are you?

393
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,720
Hi!

394
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,480
I said 'no' to you

395
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,680
Why are you following me?

396
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,800
Aunty Neeraja is our friend too

397
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,320
Don't you remember?
She introduced us to each other

398
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,400
I was just kidding
Don't you get it?

399
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,840
I am on a diet
I don't eat carbohydrates

400
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,800
These aren't carbohydrates
They're minced meat patties

401
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,480
They taste yummy
Take one

402
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,560
I am a vegetarian
I only eat salads

403
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,160
You know?
Keep it simple!

404
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,560
Sweets?
No way!

405
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,960
Do you have Diabetes?

406
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,680
Shall I get you tablets
from my grandpa?

407
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,480
I don't have Diabetes

408
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,280
Eating oily food
reduces your life span

409
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,720
Fat accumulates in the body
leading to reduced metabolism and...

410
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,800
Really?

411
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,280
This is just the information you need

412
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,120
If you follow this diet,
you can easily lose 10 to 15 kilos

413
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,840
I am taking these for my mom
These are not for me

414
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,160
Some people look beautiful
even if they eat minced meat patties

415
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,280
She is cute!

416
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,320
Aunty, you are the one
who should be on a diet

417
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,920
Abhi, stop kidding

418
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,160
How is your work in films?

419
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,160
I don't make films
I make documentaries

420
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,920
I am making one on toilets

421
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,680
Hygiene is very important

422
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,040
A documentary on toilets!

423
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,640
I knew something was fishy
when you took that long in the toilet

424
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,560
Something is wrong!

425
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,120
Your brother volunteered to help

426
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,480
Is he?

427
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,880
Don't trust him
He will leave you stranded

428
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,440
Abhi, come here

429
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,960
I'll see you soon

430
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,960
What a beautiful view!

431
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,880
Thanks!

432
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,560
I know I look beautiful
from this angle

433
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,640
Is that a soft drink?

434
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,760
Do you want a sip?

435
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,000
No, thanks!

436
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,880
It is late

437
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,240
I have to leave
I came by to say goodbye

438
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,560
Will your mom ground
you if you are late?

439
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,120
No, I jog at the park
at 6 in the morning

440
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,360
That early?

441
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,720
Actually even earlier, I go at 5 am

442
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,440
I wake up at 4 am too

443
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,880
I wake up at 4 am
even if I go to bed at 3

444
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,840
I hate to wake up
late in the mornings

445
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,160
Even if I skip jogging a single day,
my body and joints ache

446
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,000
Do you jog too?

447
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,360
What a question?
Sit down

448
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,880
As a child, I've jogged at every park
except the one you go to

449
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,360
Why don't you come there tomorrow?
Let us jog together

450
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
Is it a date?

451
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,000
Are you okay?

452
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,360
Wait! Let me see

453
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,520
'The time was 9.51 then'

454
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,920
In 21 seconds...

455
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,960
'When my grandpa stole
his favourite 'laddu''

456
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,880
'That moment when Jyothi sprayed her
favourite perfume for the tenth time'

457
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,920
'That moment when my
mom cribs to my dad'

458
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,920
'That was the moment
I heard my own heart beat'

459
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,120
See you at 4 o clock!

460
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,360
Bye!

461
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,000
Why do you look like a
tribal from the forest?

462
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,720
Shut up

463
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,360
But, this face pack makes
you look tolerable

464
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,480
Move, fatso!

465
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,640
I have to use my laptop for work

466
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,520
I have so much of work, baby

467
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,400
Are you trying to hide it from me?
Show it to me

468
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,440
You're tossing a coin for a
match that has been cancelled

469
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,840
Stop drooling over him

470
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,480
Get lost!

471
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,640
Slowcoaches, make way

472
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,440
Are you out of fuel?

473
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,120
Get lost!

474
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,880
What happened?

475
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,360
I thought I would lose weight,
but it looks like I'll lose my life

476
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
Jogging doesn't mean running fast

477
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,560
Does jogging mean
nudging forward like a snail?

478
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,840
No, jogging is an art

479
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,600
Your breath should neither
be too fast nor too slow

480
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,280
You have to maintain the right level

481
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,840
If you overdo it at one shot,
you'll be gone

482
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,840
Statistics show that 90 per cent of heart
diseases are due to poor exercising

483
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,320
So, if you maintain your
breath levels and run...

484
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,080
Please stop boring me!

485
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,120
I don't even have the
energy to run away from you

486
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,600
You continue jogging

487
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,080
All right, wait for me to finish
10 more rounds

488
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,600
Ten rounds?

489
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,960
â€œYouâ€™re young and lively
Be jollyâ€

490
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,360
Did you read the news?

491
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,800
Yes, I read it

492
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,760
Interesting

493
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,920
Grandpa

494
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,160
Go ahead and eat
I won't tell mom

495
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,320
If you give me one of that

496
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,280
You don't tell mom either

497
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,000
I will

498
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,280
If you don't take another of this

499
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,040
Just two more

500
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,120
Jalebi!

501
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,360
Take a good look

502
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,480
Do I look chubby or
have I lost weight?

503
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,800
You've lost 10 grams on your arms
and 10 kilos from your head

504
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,320
Stop obsessing over this

505
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,800
You look just fine

506
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,440
Not enough

507
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,440
The co-ordinator says
I need to lose 10 more kilos

508
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,680
You'll look like a bag of bones
if you lose 10 kilos

509
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Martin!

510
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,920
- Where do you have to deliver that?
- Royapettah

511
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,880
Why are you crazy about
fortune cookies?

512
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,000
I am not crazy
I do it just for kicks

513
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,600
Hurry up

514
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,800
Stomach upset

515
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,560
Why do you call me at this time?

516
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,320
The line to use the toilet is longer than
that waiting to watch new movies

517
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,240
We are just idling time,
why not take a selfie?

518
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,360
Don't get tense
Relax

519
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,880
I want feel

520
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,080
Ready

521
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,000
Everyone's been talking about
the 'Clean India' campaign

522
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,080
What do you feel about
having 1 toilet for every 10 houses?

523
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,840
I feel very good

524
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,240
While one guy goes
in to do his business...

525
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,320
...we spend our time
having fun with friends

526
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,160
Isn't that awesome?

527
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,640
Why did you say yes?

528
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,840
Are you Jim Carey?

529
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,760
Why are you getting so excited
about using the toilet?

530
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,120
Tone it down

531
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,120
Don't you get it?
I want the right emotions

532
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,840
Ready!
Come on!

533
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,080
What do you feel about
having 1 toilet for every 10 houses?

534
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,760
When you are in a
hurry to use the toilet...

535
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,920
...someone will
be singing inside

536
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:29,880
You will beg him to come out

537
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,560
Is this good?

538
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,880
Superb!

539
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,200
Did you tell him we're
shooting a sitcom?

540
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,560
You can't call this overacting

541
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,520
This is reality

542
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,600
We'll shoot the rest tomorrow
We're done for the day

543
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,480
Bro, Marlon Brando sir?

544
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,440
What are you doing here?

545
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,840
My brother told me
you were shooting here

546
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,720
I thought of dropping by

547
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,040
This is my friend

548
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,960
She's getting ready for the
'Miss India' pageant

549
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,040
Why don't you give her a chance
to act in your film?

550
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,480
I don't direct films

551
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,680
Forget it

552
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,320
I'll back in 5 minutes, okay?

553
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,680
How could you reject
such a handsome guy?

554
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:10,760
He looks handsome,
but he's quite a bore

555
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,440
The access to toilets
is your birthright

556
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,160
It's been 60 years since Independence

557
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,360
But this basic facility is yet to
reach the common man

558
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,640
Who is going to question
this state of affairs?

559
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,800
Mr NRI MGR

560
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,160
People are fed up of such promises

561
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,120
Those who have shot films in slums
have turned millionaires

562
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,720
But people living here
still lead a dog's life

563
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,440
I am not like the rest of them

564
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,200
My efforts may or may not
change others

565
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,600
But it does bring a change in me

566
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,000
I was one of those who would only
tweet about problems

567
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,640
I've begun to do something about them

568
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,720
That's enough for me

569
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,680
This is my journey
Not only theirs

570
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,760
These days many engage in
social work to gain publicity

571
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,320
But you do a lot of genuine work
even off the camera

572
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,480
Not bad!

573
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,880
I'm impressed

574
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,280
In my own way, I do a few things
you can term as social service

575
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,080
Nice!

576
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,200
What kind of service?

577
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,960
- Do you want to see it?
- Yes!

578
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,920
Come on
Let's take my 'Benz'

579
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,680
What about me?

580
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,160
Didn't you say you want to
visit your grandma?

581
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,240
Get going
I'll see you in the evening

582
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,400
Thank you!

583
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,200
What a lie! It's been 10 years
since my grandma died

584
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,960
Sorry!

585
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,360
- Bad road!
- That's ok!

586
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,840
Come

587
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,760
So many posters!

588
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,720
Is this a restaurant
or a movie theatre?

589
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,560
My boss is crazy about
Chinese films

590
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,480
Hi!

591
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,880
Even a Taj Mahal won't do for you
You'll find fault with everything I do

592
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,640
- Did I ask you for the Taj Mahal?
- You didn't

593
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,160
But you said you didn't want
anything for your birthday

594
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,600
Watch this

595
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,040
Don't manage it

596
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,200
You have to feel it yourself

597
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,400
Do I have to tell you everything?

598
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,680
I get angry just looking at you

599
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,960
I won't do this again

600
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,400
I'm very sorry!

601
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
Sorry!

602
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,080
Please understand

603
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,560
There is more than
one way to show love

604
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,520
Sorry da!

605
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,960
We don't fight anymore

606
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,240
That's awesome

607
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,200
Social service!

608
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:54,000
"As you open your eyes ever so slowly,
dreams are born"

609
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:02,920
"And a flower blossoms in the
wide, white expanse of your eyes"

610
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,720
"The gentle breeze wants
to know your name"

611
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,080
"And thy name is 'smile', I say"

612
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,800
"Fragrance from a lone flower
can bring little joy"

613
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:27,920
"So, dear learn the magic that turns
the lone flower into a blossoming garden"

614
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:36,640
"Your smile can change the world"

615
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:45,680
"Your smile can bring
the skies into my fold"

616
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:11,400
"Every second of every passing
minute brims with joy"

617
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:20,400
"The moment your heart realises
that, time stands still"

618
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:34,280
"Let dreams fill our eyes,
and let them become a reality"

619
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:44,960
"Let our hearts swing with the
sweet caress of the wind"

620
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:53,000
"Thoughts of you bring out the rainbow"

621
00:39:53,680 --> 00:40:01,800
"Thoughts of you changes life anew"

622
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,680
If you have any problem,
I'll set it right with a cookie

623
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,200
Everything will be okay!

624
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,480
It's amazing

625
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,360
How did you come up with
the fortune cookie idea?

626
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,200
Logic can only take you
from 'A' to 'Z'

627
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,160
But imagination has no limits

628
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,000
This was my dad's little secret

629
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,240
That's nice!

630
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,240
Sir, your order!

631
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,800
- Thanks!
- Thank you!

632
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,120
Sorry!
No!

633
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,000
It's 8 pm
I don't eat carbs now

634
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,200
I know
These are not carbs

635
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,200
This is 'Paneer Butter Masala'

636
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,480
Have it

637
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,280
Hi Simran!

638
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,480
Yes!

639
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,440
Okay, I'll be there

640
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,400
See you, bye!

641
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,080
Sorry!

642
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,880
I need to attend an
important meeting now

643
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,560
An official meeting after 8 pm

644
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,960
It's a meeting with an NGO

645
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,440
I am meeting a girl called Simran
for my documentary

646
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,280
She works in our NGO

647
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,240
See you!

648
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,000
At least, taste it
It's delicious

649
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,200
Why won't it be?
It's floating in butter

650
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,360
Some other time

651
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,240
As a policy, I don't
eat carbs after 8 pm

652
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,720
See you later
Bye!

653
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,000
Before 8 pm

654
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,000
I wonder if he breathes
after 8 pm!

655
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,600
It is past 8 pm
Don't do this, don't do that!

656
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,680
Wonder what he does after 8 pm?

657
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,760
What about after the wedding?
Won't he do anything after 8 pm?

658
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,720
Raji, why do you feel happy?

659
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,400
What is the matter?

660
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,160
Is he nice, isn't it?

661
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,640
There's the bride

662
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,240
What?

663
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,600
Come and see the grrom's photo

664
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,920
He is looking very smart

665
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,920
Are you happy now?

666
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,000
One should never delay marriage

667
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,360
We will do it immediately

668
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,840
Next month is engagement for you

669
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,360
Foreign groom for you

670
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,600
What a heavy catch!
Heavier than you, see it yourself

671
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,320
See yourself
Tell me, do you like him?

672
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,600
What are all of you doing?

673
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,320
Open your mouth

674
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,440
The Saint has blessed you

675
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,760
The groom is from the UK
and has a very successful business

676
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,040
He fell for you after seeing your photo
on the matrimonial website

677
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,840
Just now they call me
to inform about the engagement

678
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,760
Who put up my picture
on the website?

679
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,560
Is that even important?

680
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,000
We have a groom from abroad
That is what's important

681
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,360
Prince Charming didn't
get here riding a horse

682
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,160
The internet has got him here

683
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,840
God bless the Internet

684
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,360
I'll give you another 'laddu'
I know you love sweets

685
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,080
We are waiting for so long
That's why we get good alliance

686
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,680
A sweet for my Sweety...

687
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,520
Grandpa, I am telling you this again

688
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,480
I will never marry that
jackass from abroad

689
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,960
Even if you want it
to happen, it won't

690
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,960
How is that?

691
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,040
I have faith in you
He will reject the proposal himself

692
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,800
Stop pulling my leg, grandpa

693
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,200
I'll stop if you stop frowning

694
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,880
Come on, smile

695
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,280
Take this

696
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,080
- Hi!
- Hi!

697
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,160
Are you done with
your important work?

698
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,120
Which one?

699
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,200
The NGO meeting

700
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,640
It went off well
Simran was very helpful

701
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,600
Simran!

702
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,920
Even the sound of her name
has a 'run' in it

703
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,400
I am sure you got along well

704
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,760
We did
We have a lot in common

705
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,280
She is a fitness freak too

706
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,480
She does a lot of social work

707
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,280
We are just talking about
her and there she is

708
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,680
- Hi!
- Hi Abi!

709
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,360
Sweety, meet Simran!

710
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,600
Hi Sweety!

711
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,080
- Nice to meet you!
- Nice to meet you too!

712
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,880
All right, Abhi I'll leave

713
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,000
Hectic day

714
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,800
I have a lot of work to do
for Keerthi's wedding

715
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,160
I need to shop too

716
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:16,880
Okay!

717
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,640
I was telling Simran

718
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,960
I was telling her it would be good
if she came to Keerthi's wedding

719
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,880
She is feeling awkward

720
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,240
Why don't you invite her?

721
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,880
I don't know anyone there

722
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,440
I won't feel comfortable

723
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,120
She's right

724
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,800
Why? I'll be there
Sweety will be there

725
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,280
You coming, that's it!

726
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,040
But, I'll be busy

727
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,560
Come on, Simran!

728
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,280
Okay, I'll come!

729
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,320
But I don't have the right
clothes for the occasion

730
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,800
Sweety is going shopping

731
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,320
We'll join her

732
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,560
Oh really!
Okay!

733
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:55,080
Simran has joined hands with
an NGO for cleaning up slums

734
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,040
She is keen on working
with me on my documentary

735
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,640
She's organised a toilet-cleaning
campaign in the slums next week

736
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,240
She is very active

737
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,560
'Good looks like Aishwarya Rai
and a heart like Mother Teresa'

738
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,320
'Damn! Hope she dies of Ebola'

739
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,120
She's come down from London
just for this

740
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,440
You've come all the way
just to clean toilets!

741
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,360
Don't you have toilets
to clean there?

742
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,240
Good one!

743
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,080
Let's go shopping in the afternoon

744
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,720
- Come, leg's go!
- See you!

745
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,800
Just listen to this tract
You love it

746
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,040
Give it

747
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,440
Wow!

748
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,320
Nice!

749
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,120
Why do babes like her
get visas to come here?

750
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,920
Tell me the truth

751
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,280
There can be only two reasons
to come here from the UK

752
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,640
You either lost your
job or lost in love

753
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,000
Don't mean cheap!

754
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,320
Doesn't anyone ever come here
to do social service?

755
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,840
I like it a lot here

756
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,560
I'm still looking for my place here

757
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,120
I too had a choice

758
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,560
A choice between a well paid job and
making documentaries or cleaning toilets

759
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,080
My parents didn't
approve of my choice

760
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,240
They stopped talking to me

761
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,880
Only those who care about you
will get mad at you

762
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,680
My parents have never
been mad at me

763
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,640
I believe you will discover
yourself in this journey

764
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,840
Oh really!

765
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,320
How would you know?

766
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,160
Because I'll be there with you

767
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,000
Abi, can you...

768
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,240
Yes!

769
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,400
Gorgeous!

770
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,880
- Next one!
- Yes!

771
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,920
Okay!

772
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,800
Did you check on her?

773
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,640
I've heard that most girls
who come from foreign countries...

774
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,720
...to join NGOs here are imposters

775
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,120
I didn't mean Simran

776
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,880
That is the general view

777
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,560
She is as pure as gold

778
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,680
This is the latest style

779
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,760
Very nice!

780
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,560
This doesn't fit me well
Do you have an 'extra small'?

781
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,240
Shall I give you an 'extra large'?

782
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,800
Extra large!
Give that to your wife

783
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,480
I wear the 'extra small'
in the 'medium' fit

784
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,320
This is a 'medium'

785
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,000
Then this must be my size
Let me try it

786
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,520
No!

787
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,920
Don't! It will give way
if you try it on

788
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,320
Try the high-waist style
It will complement your figure

789
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,240
You look very big size on too

790
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,280
Oh really!

791
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,040
'Who the hell is she
to give me fashion tips?'

792
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,120
'She looks like a clown
in this outfit'

793
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,520
Thanks!

794
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,240
I'll try

795
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,040
- I take this
- Ok madam!

796
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,480
- Thanks!
- Welcome!

797
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,120
Sweety, what is taking you so long?

798
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,880
Are you trying the dress
or making a new one?

799
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,880
Pack it!

800
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,560
I am going on a tour with Simran

801
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,040
She is roping in several NGOs
to support my 'Clean India' campaign

802
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,120
Abhi's, 'Clean India' campaign
is very exciting

803
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,480
I've come up with a slogan for it

804
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,680
'You don't need to go
to the moon to poop'

805
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,720
That's is good one!

806
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,360
- Is it?
- Thank you!

807
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,080
'You don't need to go
to the moon to poop'

808
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:19,560
Looks like you will clean
all the toilets in India by yourself

809
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,240
India is blessed to have you

810
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,240
I'll see you later

811
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,360
Bye!

812
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,680
- I take the bag!
- Okay!

813
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,200
'Your lover is yours'

814
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,440
'That was the first time
my heart soared with the winds'

815
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:26,080
'That was the moment Dolly kissed
Chinnu's cheek for an ice cream'

816
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,520
'That moment when the boys yearned
to get the attention of the girls'

817
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,280
'That moment when the bride blushed
because the groom got playful'

818
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,640
'The machine's message was coming true
I knew my Prince Charming has arrived'

819
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,280
Velu, tie that carefully

820
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,000
Not there

821
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,560
This side

822
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,920
"A wedding's such a joyful occasion
The sound of the 'Melam' reverberates"

823
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,400
"The melody from the
'Nagaswaram' resonates"

824
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,680
"A wedding's such a joyful occasion
Colours come to life"

825
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:24,120
"Blushing and gushing is our bride"

826
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,400
"As the sound of music
hits the higher note"

827
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,560
"Our groom wants to join in and dance"

828
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,360
"A wedding's such a joyful occasion
The sound of the 'Melam' reverberates"

829
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,520
"The melody from the
'Nagaswaram' resonates"

830
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,720
"The 'Mehendi' adorns my hand"

831
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,160
"And you adorn my heart"

832
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,680
"In your vivid, colourful love"

833
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,160
"I embellish myself and rejoice"

834
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:12,640
"Unheard melodies I hear now"

835
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:17,360
"In the blink of my
eye, a dream appears"

836
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:25,440
"And in that sweet dream
I dwell, all day long"

837
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:35,000
"A wedding's such a joyful occasion
The aroma of fresh ghee, lingering"

838
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,280
"The mouth-watering
food is so tempting"

839
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:43,840
"A wedding's such a joyful occasion
With heady fragrances you are bowled over"

840
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:48,280
"With spices and condiments,
your senses are taken over"

841
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,600
"Let love light up your heart"

842
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,720
"Let happiness light up one and all"

843
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:01,400
"A wedding's such a joyful occasion
The aroma of fresh ghee, lingering"

844
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,640
"The mouth-watering food is so tempting"

845
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:32,120
"Uttering your name brings new feelings
and for that I yearn"

846
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:40,600
"Like a bee in a pot of honey,
in your love, I drown"

847
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,160
"Sensations so new, because of you"

848
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:50,040
"Will you become the very
existence of my life?"

849
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,800
"That's my only question to you"

850
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,480
"I know you want to ask
that question too?"

851
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,520
"The groom's heart flutters,
the night is all that matters"

852
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:14,240
"The bride is all eager,
nothing to match her fervour"

853
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:24,920
"She bolts the door
and that jolts the groom"

854
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,440
"He pretends to be brave
She acts like she's coy"

855
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,600
"To cuddle and speak, he languishes
But with just a kiss she finishes"

856
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:38,440
"He pretends to be brave
She acts like she's coy"

857
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:51,640
"To be touched by you just once
is my reason to exist"

858
00:55:51,680 --> 00:56:00,320
"To hear you say how tender I am
is what I wait for"

859
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,920
"My lips, wonder what a kiss is"

860
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,720
"When they meet yours, they'll know"

861
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,200
"That is the day I will celebrate"

862
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:17,840
"Falling in love, I will celebrate"

863
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,960
How could you mess up
your sister's wedding?

864
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,080
Mom!

865
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,440
The family in London liked Sweety
after seeing her photo

866
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,400
That photo was a touched up one

867
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,400
Take a look at this

868
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,520
He's edited the photos
and made Sweety look slim

869
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:09,440
If the groom's family gets to
know this, we'll die of shame

870
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,480
Don't worry
God will help us

871
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,520
That's not going to happen

872
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,240
I have to help myself

873
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,800
Come what may,
we shouldn't let go of this groom

874
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,400
I am definitely sending her to the
'Size Zero' gym from tomorrow

875
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,200
We have to ask Sweety
if she is all right with this idea?

876
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,160
This is about my daughter's marriage

877
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,040
I don't have to consider
anyone's opinion

878
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,920
I am not willing to listen to anyone

879
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,160
Sweety has to go to 'Size Zero'
gym and that's final

880
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,480
That's it!

881
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,120
This is the only way to make
this wedding happen

882
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,160
I don't care about what others think

883
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,400
Mom is right, grandpa
I can't be a burden to her any longer

884
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,840
No Prince Charming is
going to come for me

885
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,800
I don't think I can get married
without losing weight

886
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,760
I will join 'Size Zero', grandpa

887
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,200
I will marry the person
you choose for me

888
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,600
- Hi!
- Hi!

889
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,200
- Welcome to size zero
- Welcome!

890
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,800
- New admission?
- Yes!

891
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,920
Okay!

892
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,360
Please fill this form!

893
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,680
Take a look at this

894
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,040
Is there an option
for losing weight quickly?

895
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,200
Yeah, we do have mam

896
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,840
Can we pay the fee in installments?

897
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:47,720
These days, people pay in installments
for everything including Dowry

898
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,680
Just to make sure
our money is safe...

899
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,320
Mahatma Gandhi said,'Trust is where
it all begins Trust is everything'

900
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,680
If you didn't trust us,
would you have come here?

901
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,880
You've answered it yourself

902
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,640
I am 'Size Zero' Sathyanand

903
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,600
Hello, sir

904
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,680
Any doubts?

905
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,040
I am wondering if this is risky...

906
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,240
There is a very big risk

907
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,720
In the blink of an eye, your daughter
will turn as pretty as a flower

908
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,000
Isn't that a risk?

909
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,600
There'll be a stampede when men compete
to marry her Isn't that a risk?

910
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,400
When this dear girl walks on the road,
boys will follow you...

911
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,320
...trying to win the
mother-in-law's heart

912
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,600
- This is my daughter, Soundarya
- Hello!

913
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,720
We'll finalise the wedding in a month

914
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,080
The groom is an NRI

915
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,480
She is plump now
I'd like her to become slim

916
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,240
Is it possible?

917
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:46,000
'When you have a determined mind, you can
melt mountains', said Poet Kannadasan

918
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:49,400
Enroll this dear girl in the
'Express weight loss' program

919
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,360
Okay sir!

920
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,040
Can I get a discount...?

921
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,320
Rajaswari madam!

922
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,480
You can eat what you want,
you don't have to exercise and yet...

923
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,000
You will lose weight

924
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:01,280
God can't do this for you, but I can

925
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,840
Please don't talk about discounts

926
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,680
Rs 25,000 is all I have now

927
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,720
I'll give you the rest
in a day or two

928
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,120
Okay!

929
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,560
This money is not much, but I see
how much you love your daughter

930
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:14,960
This will do for now

931
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,040
One minute!

932
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,320
Oh Lord!

933
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,080
Money is Lakshmi,
our goddess of wealth

934
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,640
Have you signed the forms?

935
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,000
Let me introduce you to
your personal trainer

936
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,000
Come

937
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:35,360
When this vibrates on our waist,
it will melt our fat and make it disappear

938
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:36,920
Is this nice?

939
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,680
- Bobby!
- Hello sir!

940
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,160
This is your personal trainer

941
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,960
- Bobby!
- One minute

942
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,040
Off the machine

943
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,480
Turn it off, sir...

944
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,280
Turn it off

945
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,080
- Sorry!
- Nothing!

946
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,440
This has been imported from London,
but was made in China

947
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,560
He has trouble because the instructions
are in a foreign language

948
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,240
My name is Bobby

949
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,360
Your fat will melt and...

950
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,880
She is the not one who wants
to lose weight, it's her daughter

951
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:06,920
This is your instructor

952
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,000
Come let's show the spa

953
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,040
Okay sir

954
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,800
What are you doing?

955
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,120
This is where I want to
lose weight

956
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,480
- Where?
- Here

957
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,640
You have a 'water-bag' for a stomach

958
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,440
Even 10 of these machines can't
help you lose weight

959
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,160
What are you doing
here, pumpkin?

960
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,760
I've joined the program

961
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,800
Which one?

962
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,480
Express!
Good!

963
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,720
She is my friend

964
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,440
This week, I'll be talking to you
about the equipment

965
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,520
Pay attention

966
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,640
Understand?

967
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,120
This machine is imported
from Indonesia

968
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,400
Itâ€™s called â€˜Tickle-Ticklo-Tickleâ€™

969
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:50,120
This machine will tickle you
and burn your fat

970
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,360
Size zero magic protein shake!

971
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,280
Drink a glass of this and your
fat will disappear

972
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,400
Put this to your mouth

973
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,800
Sweety!

974
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,360
What are you doing here?

975
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,720
Have you gone mad?

976
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,200
Why 'Size Zero'?

977
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,800
Do you know anything about
this instant weight loss program?

978
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,400
I know nothing about
instant weight loss

979
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,400
I just know that nobody
likes me the way I am

980
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,400
The only man who liked me,
said yes because...

981
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,640
...he saw a photo-shopped
picture of me

982
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,080
You could have spoken
to me about it

983
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,880
Why do you go missing
all of a sudden?

984
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,640
Won't you share this with a friend?

985
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:43,120
Abi, I don't want friends

986
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,680
You asked me why I
joined 'Size Zero'

987
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,160
I am fed up

988
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,440
I am fed up of being just
a friend all the time

989
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:10,000
"Why do you seek beauty,
oh, swan?"

990
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:20,880
"Even with those wings
and such splendour"

991
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,760
"In the eyes of the beholder"

992
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:34,800
"You peck to find beauty"

993
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,200
"You, foolish girl"

994
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:47,440
"Deep within your heart..."

995
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,560
"Lies your spring of beauty"

996
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:59,680
"Why seek beauty, oh, swan?"

997
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,120
Did you anyone Sweety?

998
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,040
Sweety...

999
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,360
What happened, Jyothi?

1000
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,480
Hey, stop it

1001
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,640
What the hell are you doing?

1002
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,680
You do that to save people
from dying, not to kill them

1003
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,920
What's happened to Jyothi?

1004
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,440
I've told you several times

1005
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,680
A weight loss program will
de-hydrate your body

1006
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,840
You need to drink a lot of water

1007
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,280
I think she is alright

1008
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,360
She must have felt giddy
Take her to the hospital

1009
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,520
All of you please listen

1010
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,560
Drink lots of water

1011
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:51,800
The beauty contest is in a week
Will I be discharged by then?

1012
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,720
The beauty contest is not important
Your health is more important

1013
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:00,320
You'll be out soon and we'll feast
on Chicken Biriyani after that

1014
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:05,640
The 'fat-burning' shake
is to be blamed

1015
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,960
In order to bring about
instant weight loss

1016
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
They use a lot of illegal drugs

1017
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,560
It has a direct impact
on the kidney

1018
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,320
How long has your daughter
been using these?

1019
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,640
Three months

1020
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,000
This generation wants instant solutions
That's the problem

1021
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,160
Find a husband in an instant,
buy a car on the first job

1022
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,800
A divorce within the weekend,
weight loss in a week

1023
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,080
One of her kidneys has failed

1024
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,880
She needs a surgery
as soon as possible

1025
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:36,000
'Fat burners' aggravate the
situation for some people

1026
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,480
Hope, she is lucky

1027
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,120
That fat burners...

1028
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,400
Excuse me!

1029
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,080
What's happening here?

1030
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,480
Sweety is something to...

1031
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:02,960
Jyothi is critical because of the
illegal 'fat burners' you gave us

1032
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,360
Doctors insist on surgery

1033
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,200
Please don't spread rumours

1034
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,760
Don't spread just rumours

1035
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,080
We are a certified clinic

1036
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,760
You know, this is the
international certified clinic

1037
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,880
To hell with your certification!

1038
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:19,560
Your advertisements claim you can
lose weight within a few days

1039
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,920
Add a 'conditions apply' clause to it

1040
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,080
Say you will also lose
your kidneys and liver as well

1041
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,520
'Being born as a person in this
world is fortunate', said Poet Bharathiar

1042
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:31,760
But I say, even a fat person is
fortunate enough to have a second chance

1043
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:35,760
But doctors say he is responsible
for Jyothi's critical condition

1044
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:39,240
You've got to bear
Jyothi's hospital expenses

1045
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,080
Cat is out of the bag

1046
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,960
I was wondering what
the real problem was

1047
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,080
Did you put up this act just for money?
You could've been straight about it

1048
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,480
She is just need the money

1049
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,480
We've included a clause in the form
just for people like you

1050
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,760
That is, 'I am responsible
for any repercussions...

1051
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,880
...in my body because
of this program'

1052
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:02,480
This is what Clause 8 says and...

1053
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:06,640
...you've given your
consent with a signature

1054
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,760
How do I know what
caused Jyothi's illness...?

1055
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,960
Was it my program or was it an
overdose of contraceptive pills?

1056
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,800
She is want to a beauty queen

1057
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:18,600
Men like you rape women
and blame the women for it

1058
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,760
Mind your words

1059
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,280
Did I invite you to
join the program?

1060
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:29,560
Who pleaded with me to get you to lose
weight so that you can marry an NRI?

1061
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,200
Was it you or was it me?

1062
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,680
Who pleaded with me
to turn a plump girl into a petit one?

1063
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,240
Lazy...

1064
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,440
They don't want to do it

1065
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,200
They want a easy way out

1066
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,600
That canâ€™t complain here

1067
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,920
Please, get into your job

1068
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,920
Go, focus on your weight loss

1069
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,360
Come on guys
Go...

1070
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:03,040
Why did dad lie, grandpa?

1071
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:11,080
He said each time we fail,
it will help us reach greater heights

1072
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:17,320
But the truth is, each time I fail,
I have only slipped further

1073
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,400
I can't fight anymore

1074
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,600
I've lost

1075
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,440
Do you remember how
your dad and you...

1076
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:31,640
...would visit the railway station to
pick up tickets from the weighing machine

1077
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,960
I remember

1078
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:39,320
That machine always found ways
to link my weight with my destiny

1079
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,920
But I've never understood that

1080
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,000
This is the ticket

1081
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,560
Your dad asked me to give this to you
when you have the need for it

1082
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,440
There's nothing in this

1083
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:59,400
There won't be
You have to chalk out your destiny

1084
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,800
Your dad wanted you to know
who you could possibly be in the future

1085
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:08,320
He has given you his message
through this ticket

1086
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:12,200
From this moment on, you have to
chalk out your destiny

1087
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,920
You have to decide what
your future will be

1088
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Do you get it?

1089
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,560
Best of luck!

1090
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,880
Can you stand up?

1091
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,560
Go ahead

1092
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:49,960
We can't trust photographs
They could have 'photo-shopped' it

1093
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,320
How disgraceful! Will you do
just anything to trap my son?

1094
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:58,440
We were not planning
to cheat you

1095
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,720
My son sent you
an old photo by mistake

1096
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,880
She goes to the 'Size Zero' gym

1097
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,640
I guarantee she will lose weight

1098
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,960
I am not asking you
to go by the photo

1099
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,320
He made a mistake for sure

1100
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:15,120
But our girl is standing
right in front of you

1101
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,120
This is not cheating

1102
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,520
Of course, it is

1103
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,040
We came all the way from London
after seeing this photo

1104
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:24,000
Just because you want an NRI groom,
you can't utter big fat lies!

1105
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:27,400
Is it just the photo you've lied about?
Or is your daughter already married?

1106
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,640
The man of the house is no more
They'll do anything

1107
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,640
You're sizzling with anger
Let's cool it down

1108
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,320
Oh God!

1109
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,360
What are you doing?

1110
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,160
Do you see any cow here?

1111
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,480
Then why are you haggling as if
you are going to buy cattle?

1112
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,920
If you don't like me,
say no to me

1113
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,520
Can you stand up?

1114
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,520
Will you reject a girl
because she is fat?

1115
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:01,360
If she gets fat after the wedding,
will you divorce her?

1116
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:07,720
If girls reject boys for this very reason,
most boys will have to turn saints

1117
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,480
Will you get out on your own
or should I ask you to?

1118
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,960
That glass is ours

1119
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,320
Keep it back

1120
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,480
Thank you

1121
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,040
Good morning...

1122
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,120
Mom

1123
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,560
Hey, sweety

1124
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,560
Sweety
Sweet!

1125
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:18,920
Mom!

1126
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,960
What wrong did I do?
Why are you sulking?

1127
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,840
Did you take your tablets?

1128
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,120
Why are you being childish, mom?

1129
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,840
Where did that monkey vanish?

1130
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,400
What wrong did I do, grandpa?

1131
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,400
Can I just watch
someone insulting mom?

1132
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:45,280
Having an unmarried daughter at
home can only bring me insults

1133
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,600
But I have more trouble from my
daughter than from other people

1134
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:53,440
Mom, I thought I was your daughter

1135
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,080
I didn't know I was 'trouble'

1136
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:26,720
Thanks!

1137
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,960
I don't eat carbs

1138
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,600
This is a yummy 'Jalebi', not carbs

1139
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,360
'Jalebis' don't suit you

1140
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:37,000
An intelligent person once said,
'Jalebis' have the answers to all problems

1141
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,720
I heard about Jyothi
How is she now?

1142
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,360
How did you fall for the
'Size Zero' gimmick?

1143
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,120
How could you be that stupid?

1144
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,520
Your smarter
Then?

1145
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,840
I am not smart

1146
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,280
I was one of those stupid people
who got caught in their web

1147
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:03,600
When I look at the mirror everyday,
it pains me that I am not beautiful

1148
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,880
Every time I watch TV or movies,

1149
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:10,960
...it makes me wonder
why I was not thinner

1150
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:19,280
I've always felt that a line
divides the fat and the thin

1151
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,360
This is foolish thing

1152
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,520
For your information

1153
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,240
You rejected me

1154
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,200
But you accepted my decision

1155
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,600
We don't have much time

1156
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,960
No one else should go through
what Jyothi went through

1157
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,880
We should get these frauds arrested

1158
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,400
We must do something about it

1159
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,720
The doctors say that
the illegal 'fat burners'...

1160
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,640
...have caused Jyothi's
organs to fail

1161
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:53,040
We must join hands in exposing them

1162
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,840
No, Sweety! I am very happy

1163
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:59,200
I've lost 15 kilos because of them

1164
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,920
Sorry, Sweety! If I join you,
I will not get a refund

1165
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,320
I will only get my weight back

1166
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:09,000
I've lost 10 kilos after a very long time

1167
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,920
My husband is taking me to
Europe to celebrate that

1168
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,720
Can I come back and look into this?

1169
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,800
Hi guys, what's happening?

1170
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:30,200
Simran feels bad
about Jyothi's situation

1171
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,080
She wants to help us

1172
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:33,800
Thanks

1173
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,960
I came to India to film a
documentary about cleanliness

1174
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:42,200
But I realise that it's our minds
that need cleaning

1175
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,720
The real problem is neither Satyanand
nor the 'Size Zero' clinic

1176
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,560
The problem is with people who
don't want to face reality

1177
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,160
These clinics take advantage
of people's insecurities

1178
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:56,040
I don't understand this mad craze
to become slim instantly

1179
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,680
Sorry Sweety

1180
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,840
I didn't mean you

1181
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,720
We need to begin with
changing people's mindset

1182
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,920
Is that even possible?

1183
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,000
We too can upload videos like these

1184
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,200
This looks great

1185
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,680
I think this should work

1186
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,680
What do you think?

1187
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,560
Yes, this will definitely work

1188
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:28,920
All this is good

1189
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,520
But how do we
compete with 'Size Zero'?

1190
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,360
We have to beat them at their game

1191
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,480
We have to outdo publicity
with more publicity

1192
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,560
"Blazers without trousers,
a brook without water..."

1193
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,240
"A costume without the person..."

1194
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:07,200
"Why have you come to be that?"

1195
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,360
"A soggy 'Dosa',
a dull lifeless sound..."

1196
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,120
"A moustache without the face..."

1197
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:16,160
"Why have you come to be that?"

1198
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,280
"A pound of sweet jaggery..."

1199
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,440
"A pot of tasty honey..."

1200
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,600
"A pound of sweet jaggery..."

1201
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,120
"A pot of tasty honey..."

1202
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:31,840
"A vase full of flowers in full bloom...
You and I can get to be"

1203
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,880
"A well-endowed body,
do you want to own?"

1204
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,320
"Or do you want to be a bag of bones?"

1205
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,920
"Do you want kissable,
chubby cheeks?"

1206
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,520
"Or be a skeleton, oh, so meek?"

1207
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:49,760
"Do you want to be a hottie
who's curvy?"

1208
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:55,080
"Or look thin and lanky?"

1209
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,960
"'Size Sexy' is the new trend"

1210
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,280
â€

1211
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:05,640
"Say bye to the old 'Size Zero', honey"

1212
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,160
"'Size Sexy' is the new trend"

1213
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,720

"The whole world will be yours,
wait and see!"

1215
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,400
"Back then we looked for brides whose
ideals were sky-high"

1216
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,760
"But today, it's the size that
matters, sigh!"

1217
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:34,240
"Their smile, their sweet nature
is what mattered"

1218
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:37,000
"But today, if there's no beauty,
it'll all be shattered"

1219
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,960
"There's no more an ideal man
for the ideal woman!"

1220
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,640
"Everything's beautiful
There are no rules to reckon"

1221
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:47,920
"If you stay true to yourself, that's
the most glamorous way to be!"

1222

My friend, Jyothi fell
prey to Size Zero's...

1229
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,240
...false propaganda
that 'Slim is beautiful'

1230
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:34,320
This effort is put together to prevent
more people from falling prey to this

1231
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:38,840
If you like this video, come forward
to help our dying friend

1232
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:43,640
'Size sexy', the new
video that has gone viral...

1233
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:46,320
...is dead against the
concept of 'Size Zero'

1234
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:49,240
Let us listen to what our
audience has to say about it

1235
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,520
I met a prospective groom along with
his mother last week

1236
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:57,000
They bored me to death with their
advice on losing weight

1237
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:01,280
I turned down their advice and told
them that 'Size sexy' was the in thing!

1238
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:10,080
Girls shouldn't be skinny
They should be a little chubby like you...

1239
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,560
I don't know what 'Size Zero' is
But the song was fantastic

1240
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:23,840
Our yesteryear heroines weren't skinny
They were chubby and cute

1241
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,440
My kidneys have failed due
to 'Size Zero' fat burners

1242
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,720
They have to be penalised

1243
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,360
We have to fight this together

1244
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,640
Say no to 'Size Zero' and
yes to 'Size Sexy'

1245
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,440
Watch out, else they will reduce
you to 'Size Zero'

1246
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,920
The Media is in their favour too

1247
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,280
The easy way out is to shut down

1248
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,960
There are no permanent friends or
enemies in Media or in Politics

1249
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:51,040
A little nudge and you can even make
Satan recite the Bible

1250
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,720
- Call 'Nijam' Niranjan
- Who

1251
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,160
'Nijam' Niranjan

1252
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:02,360
This is your favourite show, 'I swear'

1253
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:03,920
In today's episode...

1254
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:09,480
Our guest, Miss Soundarya is here
to talk on, 'Size Zero is a waste'

1255
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,800
Mr Satyanand is here
to talk on the topic,

1256
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,200
'To be fat is a pain,
Size Zero is a gain'

1257
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:21,520
How can joining a 'slimming centre'
to lose weight be wrong?

1258
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,400
Losing weight is not wrong

1259
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,840
The methods followed to
lose weight are wrong

1260
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,800
Methods such as 'fat burners'...

1261
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,520
The audience wouldn't
understand that

1262
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,720
Let's ask them
Wait for your turn

1263
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,560
We are a small, middle-class family

1264
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:39,400
But our son has become
a huge burden on us

1265
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,840
'Auto rickshaw' drivers
refuse to take him...

1266
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:44,720
...to school and suggest
we take him in a truck

1267
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:50,520
He gave us a generous discount
and helped my son lead a normal life

1268
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,720
It's a got damn set up

1269
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,720
They've made fools of us

1270
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,520
I am not saying losing
weight is wrong

1271
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,080
The methods that you use
are wrong

1272
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:04,880
They propagate size not good health

1273
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:08,200
You feel they're conning you

1274
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:12,080
But some of them feel you are here...

1275
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:16,400
...just to become famous overnight

1276
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:17,880
What is your view on that?

1277
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,080
I agree this is a drama

1278
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,120
Haven't you orchestrated
this entire thing?

1279
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:28,680
'Even if the sky falls over my head,
I have no fear'

1280
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:32,280
I think of her as my sister
I didn't want her to suffer the way I did

1281
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,200
'Size Zero' made this family happy
Is that wrong?

1282
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:39,000
If you still think I am wrong,
pelt me with stones

1283
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:42,920
If you think I am a good man,
shower me with your love

1284
01:23:55,160 --> 01:24:02,440
That was only a stunt aimed at
gaining publicity...the truth is out

1285
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,600
We will meet on next week

1286
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:08,240
Until then bye from Nijam Niranjan

1287
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:14,320
How long are you going to
be in hiding, Sweety?

1288
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,520
I didn't know you were a coward

1289
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:22,720
Where is that brave girl
who rejected me?

1290
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,240
I didn't reject you
You did!

1291
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:05,920
â€

1292
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:09,440
â€

1293
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:17,560
â€

1294
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:21,760
â€

1295
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,000
That's it?

1296
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,280
Hey, No...

1297
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,480
Sweety, stop it

1298
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,960
What happened?

1299
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,520
How are you feeling?

1300
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:05,240
I spoke to the doctor
He said there's nothing to worry

1301
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:09,880
I thought 'Size Zero' would make
my dream come true

1302
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:14,280
No girl should go through this

1303
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:16,240
Make a promise

1304
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,760
Promise

1305
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:32,080
This is injustice
It shouldn't happen to anyone

1306
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,040
We have to do something

1307
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:39,640
Every bad guy will have an enemy

1308
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,240
What?

1309
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:45,400
Who stands to lose if this
slimming centre's business grows?

1310
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:52,200
Almost everyone in the
fitness industry

1311
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:19,680
Very impressive guys
Damn good presentation

1312
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,960
Thank you for your support

1313
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,760
I have to thank you!

1314
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,400
It is a pleasure to participate
in such innovative programs

1315
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:35,320
I am glad I met you

1316
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,480
I am looking forward to
working with both of you

1317
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,320
Thank for coming

1318
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,320
Was really nice meeting you

1319
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,600
I've watched your video
a number of times

1320
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,400
I really big fan of yours

1321
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:49,800
Thank you

1322
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:01,000
I promised to take Simran
out for a movie

1323
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:02,520
She will kill me

1324
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,880
- I have an idea
- What?

1325
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:37,600
I'm sorry Simran

1326
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,520
I couldn't spend time with you

1327
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:45,000
Trust me! I will try to
make time for you

1328
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:51,000
I am worried because you
have to 'try' so hard

1329
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,040
Simran, trust me

1330
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:54,280
This won't happen again

1331
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,760
I will fix it

1332
01:28:56,680 --> 01:29:00,680
A machine can be fixed
Not the heart...

1333
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:11,720
I am short of ideas for the campaign
but you want to talk about love!

1334
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:17,440
I want to be truly in love with Simran
But I don't know how

1335
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:19,840
How do I decide?
Is there any way?

1336
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:23,160
There are plenty of ways
Sekhar is calling

1337
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,600
Can we discuss this later?

1338
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:28,800
Hi Sekhar

1339
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:30,520
I have just about to call you

1340
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,720
Tomorrow is ad shoot

1341
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,400
If you come, it will be nice

1342
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,160
Get fit
Don't quit

1343
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:38,480
Poster girl of beauty â€˜Soundaryaâ€™
started this new programme

1344
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,200
Her speech in heard everywhere

1345
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,400
Let's wait and see

1346
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:43,360
Sponsors by PVP sports

1347
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,400
Your daughter has become very famous
What do you have to say?

1348
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:51,600
How can an unmarried girl do this?
She's disgraced the family

1349
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:54,440
How could she dance
around like that!

1350
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,640
I never imagined my daughter
will do this to me

1351
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:03,880
Are you ok?

1352
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:05,840
Mom is very angry with me

1353
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,200
I don't know how to make
her happy

1354
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:12,240
Happy? She is going to
be proud of you

1355
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:16,760
It's very rare to find selfless
people like you

1356
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,480
You know youâ€™re special
you make us all proud

1357
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:23,440
You know something

1358
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,760
If I had known all this about you
the first time we met...

1359
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:29,000
...I wouldn't have let go of you even
when you rejected me

1360
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,920
- Hi
- Hi

1361
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:42,920
Sorry

1362
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:47,680
Sekhar and I are going to
invite special guests for the campaign

1363
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,160
Will get late

1364
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:51,360
I'll see you tomorrow
Bye

1365
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,880
- Shall we go?
- Yeah, sure

1366
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,560
- Sorry for the delay
- That's okay

1367
01:30:58,640 --> 01:30:59,720
Come

1368
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:21,600
I am so relieved that she has
agreed to get married

1369
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:24,400
How did you meet her?

1370
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:30,440
We first met near the toilets,
do you remember?

1371
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,440
It was so funny

1372
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,120
I thought he was a volunteer
and handed him a broom

1373
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,920
Tell them, Abhi

1374
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:43,800
When I met Sweety for the first time,
I realised we had a connection

1375
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,760
I am not Sweety, I am Simran

1376
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:02,160
Take this! Wait
It's all for you

1377
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,480
Give it to your friends as well

1378
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,760
If all of you come,
we can have fun exercising

1379
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:10,200
These handouts are not meant
to make paper boats

1380
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:11,560
Read it and get there to help

1381
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:13,120
Stop staring

1382
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:16,320
This park is so boring!

1383
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:17,760
Listen to me

1384
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,920
Our next stop has to be at
a women's college

1385
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,640
That's my order!
And that becomes the law

1386
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:26,680
Why, do you want to shamelessly
get business from them?

1387
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,520
Work on getting more registrations

1388
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,320
That's a great idea

1389
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,600
Fifty people have registered so far

1390
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,760
That's good

1391
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:37,000
Where is Simran?

1392
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:43,400
Her parents are here
I met them by chance...

1393
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,280
I am sure they
would have liked you...

1394
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,080
All the best

1395
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:51,280
Sweety, actually you know
what I want to...

1396
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,560
"A pound of sweet jaggery...

1397
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:57,200
A pot of tasty honey..."

1398
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:00,800
"A pound of sweet jaggery...
A pot of tasty honey..."

1399
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:06,800
"A vase full of flowers in full bloom...
You and I can get to be"

1400
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,600
Hey, dude
Hi, Sweety

1401
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,880
I am a big fan of yours

1402
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,160
In fact...

1403
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,200
Biggest...

1404
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:34,040
I love sweets, but after seeing you
even sweets don't taste good anymore

1405
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,320
I will bring you something

1406
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:43,560
If you accept me along with this
'Laddu', my life will get sweet

1407
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:45,440
Sweety, Please

1408
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,840
We have some work to do

1409
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,280
You go ahead!
I need to speak to Sweety

1410
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,600
I've spoken to my parents,
they're fine with you

1411
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,760
I am sure your parents will be
doubly fine with me

1412
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,840
I am very excited
So what next?

1413
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:02,320
When can we come to your house
and ask for your hand?

1414
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:05,600
This unique campaign has got
everybody's attention

1415
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:10,680
Don't forget the cause!
It's a campaign to save Jyothi

1416
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:12,920
Don't get me wrong

1417
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:15,640
Can't we win her over
with our money?

1418
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,120
Else, our business will be shut down

1419
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:19,840
If I do that now,
everyone will think she was right

1420
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:24,040
The Media will
shut our business down in a jiffy

1421
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:27,200
These cheap tactics don't scare me

1422
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:30,560
Let's see how far this can go

1423
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:44,640
What's all this?

1424
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:46,920
Hello everybody

1425
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:49,880
Come on, don't just stand around

1426
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,680
What is this set up for?

1427
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,520
Can you explain this
to us in simple terms?

1428
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:00,240
All these cycles are connected
to the huge wheel in the centre

1429
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:03,640
When everyone cycles, the energy generated
will set the wheel in motion

1430
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:20,000
Come on, altogether

1431
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:33,720
As the wheel rotates, the over-weight
figure on display will lose weight

1432
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:47,880
The screen will give you an update
on the amount of calories burnt

1433
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:53,920
The faster you cycle, the faster
she loses weight and becomes healthy

1434
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:22,080
Hi, guys

1435
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:25,800
Are you wondering what
the 50,000 is?

1436
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:33,040
An important person is here
to tell us the value of that 50,000

1437
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,520
Let's watch

1438
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,400
Hi, greetings

1439
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:39,160
Fifty thousand...

1440
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:46,280
That's not just a calorie count but also
the money you earned to save a life

1441
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:50,520
Jyothi, the victim
of false claims made by...

1442
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:53,240
...a 'slimming centre',
is fighting for her life

1443
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:57,560
PVP sports has come forward
to bear the cost of Jyothi's surgery...

1444
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,680
...by contributing a rupee
for each calorie that you burn

1445
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,720
If we want to save a life,
writing a cheque...

1446
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:07,920
...is the easiest thing
for any of us to do

1447
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:13,080
However, the motive of this campaign
is to create awareness

1448
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:17,600
This isn't only about our
hard-earned money

1449
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:22,760
This is our effort to prevent
such injustice from happening again

1450
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,960
Every droplet of sweat will make
a difference in saving Jyothi's life

1451
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,600
So get fit...don't quit

1452
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:52,080
"Life is a circle"

1453
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:56,280
"There's no beginning, no end"

1454
01:37:56,400 --> 01:38:03,640
"Let's come together
to reach our destiny"

1455
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:09,480
"The peak is far away
Let's take the first step"

1456
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:16,600
"The harvest is a long time away
Let's sow the seeds, our dreams"

1457
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:21,400
"The battles we need to win
are the ones waged within"

1458
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:25,120
"Your enemies you'll find
deep within you"

1459
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:27,800
"In this circle of life..."

1460
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:30,400
"...you are the chariot
and the charioteer"

1461
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:32,440
"You are the path and
you are the pace"

1462
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:35,680
"If beads of sweat and toil
fuel your course..."

1463
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:39,760
"...victory will be yours, of course"

1464
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:37,480
I told you
This game can't go on

1465
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:39,880
Where can a stationary
cycle take them?

1466
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,520
Kill the game

1467
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:44,920
We've been cycling the last four days

1468
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,520
But, we haven't met
even half the target

1469
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,640
It was a sheer waste of time

1470
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:51,480
My muscles are aching
because of cycling

1471
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:52,600
This won't do

1472
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:54,080
We need more publicity

1473
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:57,080
We have to create more awareness
and motivate people

1474
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:59,000
There isn't much time left
for Jyothi's surgery

1475
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,160
Don't worry, Sweety

1476
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:02,280
Even if we don't
achieve the target...

1477
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:04,600
I will bear the expenses
of Jyothi's surgery

1478
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:06,840
She will be okay
I promise

1479
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:08,680
Thanks

1480
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,320
But, this campaign
isn't just about Jyothi

1481
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:15,720
It's for all the innocent people
trapped in webs like these

1482
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:17,760
We have to win!

1483
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,280
Watch out, mom is here!

1484
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:41,200
I visited Jyothi at
the hospital yesterday

1485
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:47,880
It could have been you
I realise how foolish I've been

1486
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,480
My mother always encouraged me

1487
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:55,720
She always said I was capable of
doing anything

1488
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,880
She felt nothing was impossible for me

1489
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,680
She would always defend me

1490
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:03,640
She didn't care even if the
whole world was against her

1491
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:08,920
That helped me manage life
after your father died

1492
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:13,800
But, I've failed as a mother now

1493
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:18,720
I failed to give you the confidence
that my mother gave me

1494
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,280
Forgive me

1495
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:31,200
We shouldn't spare that arrogant
guy who owns 'Size Zero'

1496
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:33,000
We are with you

1497
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:37,800
I brought all my colleagues
to support your cause

1498
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:16,920
"Let the fire in your eyes
ignite your muscles"

1499
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
â€

1500
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:23,720
â€

1501
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:31,480
"Let the zeal in your heart
take over your legs"

1502
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:34,920
â€

1503
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:38,760
â€

1504
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:11,600
Which hospital is Jyothi in?

1505
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:14,320
An unforeseen development
in the 'Save Jyothi' campaign

1506
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:16,920
Jyothi is now saying that her kidney
failure wasn't caused by 'Size Zero'...

1507
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,120
...but by the indigenous medicines,
she consumed to lose weight

1508
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:23,720
Miss size zero Sathya is here
to make a statement

1509
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:30,720
Just a minute, please

1510
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:36,920
Everything is fair in war

1511
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,240
It is only about winning!

1512
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:42,680
Save Jyothi campaign

1513
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:48,640
All of you know that
this campaign is a cheap tactic...

1514
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:52,240
...used by some people
who want to get rid of me

1515
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:56,400
In this land where
Mahatma Gandhi was born...

1516
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,400
...I believe truth will prevail

1517
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:01,520
Today, I am going to...

1518
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:05,480
Jyothi, instant gratification
is what people want

1519
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:09,440
I am just cashing in on that

1520
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:13,880
That cycling campaign is not going
to help you in any way

1521
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,320
If the Media gets a
more interesting headline...

1522
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:18,760
...they will forget about you

1523
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:23,680
There is no personal
enmity between us

1524
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:27,720
You are not well because of the
'fat burners' given by my company

1525
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:28,840
I apologise for that

1526
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:32,680
Here's Rs 1 crore

1527
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:34,720
You wouldn't have seen
this kind of money

1528
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:38,680
Just listen to me! Take this
and withdraw your statement

1529
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:41,480
I know you want to become a
'beauty queen' I will take care of that

1530
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,480
Tell us, sir

1531
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:46,880
Truth prevails

1532
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,040
Sorry for the disturbance, sir

1533
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:53,400
Someone's here asking for you

1534
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:55,920
They're here to cut you to size...

1535
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:57,240
Here they are...

1536
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:22,760
I love you

1537
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:29,800
Simran wants me
to meet her parents

1538
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:34,760
All the best

1539
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:42,600
Say yes

1540
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:03,720
Yes

1541
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:26,760
I am not sure, Simran

1542
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:30,040
Stop running away from yourself

1543
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,480
Maybe then you will realise...

1544
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:41,280
You think this is wrong...

1545
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:44,400
...because your heart says
she is the one for you

1546
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:47,720
Go on, tell Sweety

1547
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:50,680
It's too late

1548
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,440
She is getting engaged tomorrow

1549
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:01,440
You wanted an NRI groom
but you found a 'prince' right here

1550
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:04,000
Even the Engagement celebration
is as grand as a Wedding

1551
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:05,520
You've hit the jackpot!

1552
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:15,240
I've waited the last 27 years
to pass on this saree I've treasured

1553
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,000
That moment has arrived

1554
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:19,880
You are happy, aren't you?

1555
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:23,280
I am very happy

1556
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:24,480
Take it

1557
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:28,120
Hurry up, get dressed

1558
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:45,960
Please sit down

1559
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:57,160
"As you open your eyes ever so slowly,
dreams are born"

1560
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:05,800
"And a flower blossoms in the
wide, white expanse of your eyes"

1561
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:09,960
"The gentle breeze wants
to know your name"

1562
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:12,480
'With love you can
conquer the whole world'

1563
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:16,080
"And thy name is 'smile', I say"

1564
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:20,840
"Fragrance from a lone flower
can bring little joy"

1565
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:24,520
"So, dear learn the magic that turnsâ€¦"

1566
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:27,240
'You can win anything with a smile'

1567
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:30,320
"â€¦the lone flower into
a blossoming garden"

1568
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:39,440
"Your smile can change the world"

1569
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:45,760
"Your smile can bring
the skies into my fold"

1570
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:47,880
It's getting late
Bring the bride

1571
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:54,600
Sweety, hurry up

1572
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:58,840
(slokas)

1573
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,840
It's getting late
Both of you change the rings

1574
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:07,520
Give that to her

1575
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:24,520
Marriages are made in heaven

1576
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:27,160
In upstairs

1577
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:30,320
It's getting late
We have to begin the ceremony

1578
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:31,480
Go

1579
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:34,720
God

1580
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:01,480
What?

1581
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:03,320
Nature's call...

1582
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:06,520
Now?

1583
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:09,280
- Please
- Okay

1584
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:11,520
Carry on!

1585
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:49,440
Where is the message?

1586
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:00,920
My life is incomplete without you

1587
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:09,280
Will you marry me?

1588
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:16,760
That moment when
my heart stopped beating...

1589
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:24,160
That moment when a confused Sekhar
was twirling the engagement ring...

1590
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:27,960
That moment when my mom looked on
with panic-stricken eyes

1591
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:30,840
That moment when
the still smile from...

1592
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:33,040
...my dad's picture showered
me with blessings

1593
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:36,600
That moment when
the machine at the station...

1594
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:40,600
...was enticing another
child into a fairy tale

1595
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:44,720
It was at that moment
I realised...

1596
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:48,440
...the Prince Charming
who accepted me

1597
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:50,960
...the way I am, was finally here

1598
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,480
You are late

1599
01:52:57,520 --> 01:52:59,320
I only took a 'bathroom-break'...

1600
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,760
I can't break the engagement

1601
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,600
Shall we elope?

1602
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:26,480
I promise I won't bore you anymore

1603
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:28,000
I won't give you advice on calories

1604
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:29,680
I will eat all the carbs you give me

1605
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:32,000
Let's be spontaneous and not
plan anything anymore

1606
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:33,440
I will become like you

1607
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:38,640
I was waiting all along
and you tell me this now!

1608
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:41,160
Do you realise
you like me only now?

1609
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:43,360
I feel sorry for that Prince Charming...

1610
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:45,320
He's waiting with a ring for me

1611
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:46,920
What will I tell him?

1612
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,200
Sorry...forgive me

1613
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:50,480
Can I tell him that my foolish guy...

1614
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:52,680
...just realised that
he can't live without me?

1615
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:55,880
Go, hang yourself after 8 pm

1616
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:57,160
Great idea!

1617
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:59,680
Do you have no shame?

1618
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:02,480
I had my doubts when you gave a
silly excuse to get away from there

1619
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:04,720
Remove your shirt
Untie your saree

1620
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:05,720
What?

1621
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,320
How will you elope?

1622
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:10,000
By jumping off from here?

1623
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:12,560
Do you have any sense?
That would be a short cut to heaven

1624
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:17,280
Knot the saree around the pillar
and you go down first

1625
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:19,360
If the saree doesn't tear
despite your weight...

1626
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:21,240
...let my son-in-law follow suit

1627
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:23,480
This seems to be the
best plan for now

1628
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:30,800
I had a feeling history would
repeat itself today

1629
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:32,960
Why do you look stunned?

1630
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,680
Your father was 'Telugu'
and I am 'Tamil'

1631
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:37,400
How do you think we got married?

1632
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,600
Exactly the same way

1633
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:41,240
- Why haven't you removed the shirt?
- I'll do it myself

1634
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:45,320
Don't just look, help me do this

1635
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:48,800
Why do you look confused?

1636
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,320
What about the people waiting?

1637
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:52,240
You don't worry about that

1638
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:53,600
I need no training to act

1639
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:55,160
I am the 'Villain of all villains'

1640
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:56,680
Hurry up!

1641
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:06,400
I was anxious about getting you married,
but your happiness comes first

1642
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:09,280
Leave now
I am with you always

1643
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:19,880
Don't worry, dad
She will be here any minute

1644
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:23,480
Sweety...

1645
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:24,840
- Aunty!
- Hold her

1646
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:26,400
What happened?

1647
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:27,720
Get some water!

1648
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,160
It is happiness henceforth

1649
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:16,160
"The beautiful girl,
with curvy hips"

1650
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:19,240
"The beautiful girl,
with a golden glow"

1651
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:22,200
"The beautiful girl,
with a naughty smile"

1652
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:26,640
"My heart doesn't want
to let go of your thoughts"

1653
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:31,480
"The beautiful girl,
with curvy hips"

1654
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:34,600
"The beautiful girl,
with a golden glow"

1655
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:37,520
"The beautiful girl,
with a naughty smile"

1656
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:41,880
"My heart doesn't want
to let go of your thoughts"

1657
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:46,800
"How can I forget you, my love?"

1658
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:50,000
"My love entices you"

1659
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:55,800
"Let's sway in the swing of love"

1660
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:59,160
"The beautiful girl,
with curvy hips"

1661
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:02,240
"The beautiful girl,
with a golden glow"

1662
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:05,320
"The beautiful girl,
with a naughty smile"

1663
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:09,480
"My heart doesn't want
to let go of your thoughts"
