1
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:24,167
Yes. I'm at the medicine shop.

2
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:27,417
How much longer will you take?

3
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:30,833
Okay.

4
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:34,500
I've been waiting for ages!

5
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,542
And now you're helping
other people before me.

6
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,625
Yeah...

7
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, I'll look into it.

8
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,083
Ankita?

9
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,292
Ankita!

10
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,625
Ankita! Wait!

11
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:52,875
Ankita!

12
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,458
Ankita, I know why you're trying to escape.

13
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,000
Stop!

14
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,500
Ankita! Stop!

15
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,167
Ankita! Stop!

16
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,250
-Oh no! What happened?
-Oh God! Is she dead?

17
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,833
They say there are no such things
as accidents.

18
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:16,292
Everything is predestined.

19
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,208
My elder sister used to say
that accidents do happen...

20
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,000
but what happens
happens for the best.

21
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:37,042
ROKTO ROHOSHYO

22
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,571
It is 8:01AM and
you're listening to

23
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,625
your favourite morning show
"Whatever you want!"

24
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:48,375
When we were kids, we used to
eagerly wait for one person's arrival.

25
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:52,125
But we had to be asleep
or he wouldn't come if we were awake!

26
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm talking about
the one and only Santa Claus.

27
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:59,083
What kind of goodies did he
leave behind in all our stockings?

28
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:03,208
Your host Swarnaja is here
to talk about that and whatever you want.

29
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:07,635
Whatever stories you have hidden within
those stockings, share them with us!

30
00:04:07,712 --> 00:04:12,004
Our number is 2282 2282.

31
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:20,630
Hello?

32
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,765
Hello?

33
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,882
Hi!

34
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,167
I want to write a letter to God.

35
00:04:27,453 --> 00:04:28,167
What?

36
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,333
How do I send a letter to God?

37
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,695
A letter to God?
How old are you?

38
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:38,497
Hello?

39
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:40,628
Hello?

40
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:45,502
We got cut off.
We'll try to reconnect.

41
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:47,940
Till then, think about this, guys.

42
00:04:47,977 --> 00:04:53,454
How would you connect a letter to God
with intimate memories of Christmas?

43
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,182
On that note,
here is an intimate song.

44
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,372
Keep listening to 98.3 FM.
Radio Mirchi listeners are always happy!

45
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:09,714
In the cheeky winds
You can hear the bees whispering

46
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:21,031
You may hide
But I know how to seek

47
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:32,585
In the cheeky winds
You can hear the bees whispering

48
00:05:34,953 --> 00:05:41,100
You may hide
But I know how to seek

49
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,345
What is it?

50
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,758
What happened?

51
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:45,828
He's become very naughty, ma'am.

52
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:48,501
Running around and playing all day!
He fell down again today.

53
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:53,779
Ma'am, I think it's about time you
registered Parag at the blood bank.

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,417
He got away with minor scratches today...

55
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:59,287
but if something worse happens tomorrow,
it might get risky.

56
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,599
-We won't find his blood type anywhere.
-Oh no!

57
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:04,786
Why don't you take his...

58
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,125
blood sample and deposit it
at the blood bank?

59
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,270
That's better.

60
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:09,239
Let's see the scratch.

61
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,249
My hands are empty

62
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,978
But the answer is precious

63
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:17,750
My hands are empty

64
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:20,681
But the answer is precious

65
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:26,427
Is she too arrogant for wanting to know?

66
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:32,318
Does she just want to play?
Play all day?

67
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:39,914
You may hide
But I know how to seek

68
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:48,769
Oh, the cheeky winds

69
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:55,812
We take special care of our children
and we make sure...

70
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:57,528
Here they are!

71
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:02,492
What's your name?

72
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:03,750
Parag.

73
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,570
His blood group is a bit rare.

74
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:09,876
-And what's your name?
-Mumu.

75
00:07:09,903 --> 00:07:17,961
Our favourite toys are forgotten

76
00:07:18,153 --> 00:07:25,819
Just to indulge the glint in her eyes

77
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:34,140
Her very molecules
Want to blossom into greatness

78
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:41,827
You are unaware
I light up the night with the fireflies

79
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,513
Even iron can melt

80
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:47,302
Due to a turbulent heart

81
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,959
Even iron can melt

82
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:52,510
Due to a turbulent heart

83
00:07:52,627 --> 00:07:58,963
But finding a true gem
Can steal your slumber

84
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,370
Hello? This is Mirchi Swarnaja.

85
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,547
How can I send a letter to God?

86
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,468
You hung up the previous day
and you didn't give your contact details.

87
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,175
Where are you calling from?
Where do you stay?

88
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,884
Home.

89
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,458
Alright! And who else stays at your home?
Mom, dad, grandpa, grandma?

90
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:18,125
Have you shared your thoughts
with anyone?

91
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,030
Hey!

92
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:21,363
Why are you on the phone?

93
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:22,350
Huh?

94
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,297
Come on! Now you'll be in trouble.

95
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:43,417
Ma'am?

96
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:44,958
Hosting a new show?

97
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:47,333
My sister is an anchor
at a radio station.

98
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:49,167
Anchor is literally
a type of grappling hook.

99
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,102
So sad people around her
get caught in that grappling hook

100
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:54,009
and sis tries her best
to help them.

101
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,502
The embodiment of
a welfare programme.

102
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:56,970
No, nothing like that.

103
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,605
Some kid has been
calling the last few days.

104
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:00,625
Something about
writing a letter to God.

105
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,820
So I asked your God to look out for him.

106
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:04,164
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

107
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:05,919
-One plate eggs and toast.
-Of course.

108
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:10,017
You're talking as if that idol would have
divine powers without your help!

109
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,661
Enough of your nonsense!

110
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,000
-Don't make light of others' beliefs.
-When did I do that?

111
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,027
But for all the welfare work she did...

112
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:18,075
she didn't receive any recognition.

113
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:19,909
Sometimes, people attributed it
to good luck...

114
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,590
and sometimes to God.

115
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,460
When she first visited this shop
six years ago

116
00:09:24,484 --> 00:09:26,856
the situation was completely different.

117
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:28,335
Can I get some tea?

118
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,351
Not available, ma'am.

119
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,808
What?

120
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,046
We don't have any tea.

121
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:36,109
A tea stall with no tea?

122
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,779
Why keep the stall open then?

123
00:09:37,804 --> 00:09:38,904
Why?

124
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:40,639
Do I need to have tea
just because my shop is open?

125
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:42,128
Why are you talking to me like that?

126
00:09:42,153 --> 00:09:46,304
Actually, we don't have anything;
tea, sugar, kerosene, biscuits, nothing.

127
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:48,770
We don't get any customers...

128
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:53,270
People urinate just beside the stall,
so no one wants to come due to the stench.

129
00:09:53,495 --> 00:09:56,356
I wonder when God will
spare us a glance.

130
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:57,676
No, ma'am.

131
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:00,561
No God can fix our situation.

132
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,417
The municipality employees,
sweepers and the like...

133
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:06,264
They come here and pee.

134
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,625
We don't get a single customer
because of the stench.

135
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:13,384
And if we don't get customers,
how are we supposed to buy new stock?

136
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,790
My sister's heart is
just like instant noodles.

137
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,664
It takes just two minutes to soften.

138
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,156
It was the beginning of the month.

139
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:20,772
The timing was perfect.

140
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,667
Grandma was furious...

141
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,179
and my mom was
adding fuel to the fire!

142
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,756
Typical know-it-all!

143
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:28,365
Hey.

144
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,092
These are all cream biscuits!

145
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,935
This won't do...
Oh my!

146
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,488
Look at this! White oil!
They don't even cook in white oil.

147
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:37,281
She hasn't even got a job,
and now she's worried about society!

148
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,914
Bani, let it be!

149
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,417
-They'll take whatever they need.
-I'll arrange it all.

150
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,723
Why didn't you ask me
before buying all this?

151
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:44,833
What do you think?

152
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,411
Buying all this just once is enough?

153
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,103
Will other customers
donate like this every month?

154
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:50,833
Hey! Give that back!

155
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:55,288
Grandma's talk about donations
gave Sis a brand new idea!

156
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,178
What if God curses us?

157
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,510
Has anything else helped your stall?
Just do as I say.

158
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:03,197
-Okay.
-Let's see what your God can do.

159
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,902
If He can't stop people urinating,
what can He do?

160
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:19,657
Ma'am, turn the idol this way.
Just a bit more.

161
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,298
A bit more.
That's it! Perfect!

162
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,384
That's perfect!

163
00:11:22,423 --> 00:11:24,083
I've heard of people
who help the poor by...

164
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,689
building houses, finding jobs
and setting up shops for them.

165
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:28,864
I've never heard of anyone
making a temple for them.

166
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:32,931
Only one person had to see it
for Sis' plan to work.

167
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:33,914
That's it!

168
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:38,103
People came here to urinate
and left without paying.

169
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:41,000
Now they come to pray
instead of urinating.

170
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:43,477
How much do you have?

171
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,875
-Ten thousand.
-Adds up to 370 bucks.

172
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,458
Really?
Have you counted properly?

173
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,786
That's 10, 370!
Bless the Lord!

174
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,322
What is he doing?

175
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,333
I've seen him once before.

176
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,953
He must have asked for a wish.
Must have come true, so he's back.

177
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,167
Look! He's about to make a donation!

178
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,584
They want you to be an anchor?

179
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,670
Yes!

180
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,267
It's a new show.

181
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:29,006
Starts next month.
I'm the solo host.

182
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,016
Hey!

183
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,022
Will we get to hear you
on the radio?

184
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:35,183
At what time?

185
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,392
Between eight and nine a.m.

186
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:37,473
Oh!

187
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,125
-Can you make me some noodles?
-Sure.

188
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:41,298
Not now!
You have your blood donation now.

189
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,033
Besides, we're out of noodles.

190
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,100
Babai...

191
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,458
why don't you get two packets
of noodles from Madan's shop?

192
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,723
Okay.

193
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,100
I'll get it.

194
00:12:58,292 --> 00:12:59,125
Is she home?

195
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,471
Yes. She's in her room.

196
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,718
Sis, do you want a cushion
to rest your arm on?

197
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,140
No need. She's done.

198
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:17,421
Okay.

199
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:27,072
You can go.

200
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,799
For Sis, donating blood
had become routine.

201
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:35,725
Ever since I came to this house...

202
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,922
I remember seeing Doctor Uncle coming to
take her blood every three months.

203
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:42,872
Since her blood group was rare,
she had to maintain her own blood bank.

204
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,625
Doctor Uncle called it Golden Blood.

205
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,833
But every time I saw it,
I found no difference.

206
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:50,250
It looked like normal blood.
Like any of ours.

207
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,346
Shonai...

208
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,875
it's about time you started working out.

209
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,709
Your blood pressure is quite low.

210
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,592
I can work out here at home,
Doctor Uncle.

211
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,667
I don't need to go anywhere else.

212
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,303
I've been hearing that
for two years now.

213
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,224
I've seen how much you work out. Huh!

214
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,386
Doctor, tell her what to do.

215
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,972
Don't worry about it.
I'll arrange everything.

216
00:14:11,997 --> 00:14:12,667
Thanks!

217
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,316
All you have to do is send her there.

218
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:16,117
You arrange it first.
I'll manage the rest.

219
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:17,958
She thinks she can do
whatever she wants!

220
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:19,219
Let's go.

221
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,625
I'll give you the address.

222
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,518
"Whatever you want..."

223
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:31,903
I've got it.

224
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,505
What if I name my show 'Whatever you want'?
How does that sound?

225
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,356
Why that?

226
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,794
The concept of my show
is to share secrets.

227
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:46,536
Say you have a secret which
you haven't shared with anyone...

228
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,185
and you suddenly want to...

229
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,240
anonymously... Interesting!

230
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:52,692
You can anonymously share it with everyone.

231
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,958
It could be about
happiness, sadness, anything!

232
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,225
What about anger?

233
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,358
If I'm angry about something,
can I curse on air?

234
00:15:00,455 --> 00:15:02,197
Like calling someone son of a b***h?

235
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:04,307
No!

236
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:08,600
Anger... you can't really curse
since it's a show...

237
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,167
But anger...

238
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,875
You can talk about anger.

239
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,250
What would you talk about?

240
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:18,328
Anger, happiness, sorrow...
What would you share?

241
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:43,917
What are you doing, Mom?

242
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,208
I'm knitting a sweater, dear.

243
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,292
Are you making it for me?

244
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,625
Didn't I make one for you
a few days ago?

245
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,750
Who is it for then? My brother?

246
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:58,880
How did you know that
you've got a brother coming?

247
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,667
Have a safe journey.

248
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,125
I'll come over in the evening with Shonai.

249
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,542
You all take care.

250
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:06,114
-Stay safe.
-Of course.

251
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,417
When will you return, Mom?

252
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,250
I'll be back soon.

253
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,581
Till then...

254
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:22,292
keep this with you.
Keep it safe.

255
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,292
I'll take it from you when I return.

256
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:25,583
My sweetheart.

257
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,125
Listen to Grandma.

258
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,663
-Go safely.
-Don't be naughty.

259
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,815
Bye!

260
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,792
Bye, Mom.

261
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:46,479
-Something happened here!
-Help her!

262
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:48,468
She's still alive!

263
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:50,367
(indistinct yelling)

264
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:59,619
(chanting funeral hymns)

265
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,562
Mom?
You said you'd take this back.

266
00:18:19,786 --> 00:18:21,578
Why do people commit suicide?

267
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:25,958
I don't know.

268
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,125
When dreams are shattered...

269
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,007
When there's nothing more to life...

270
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,163
Maybe they get driven to it.

271
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,092
Did your mom feel that way?
Are you sure?

272
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:49,778
Mom had changed after the miscarriage.

273
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:55,352
No one thought
she'd do something like that.

274
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:58,710
Sometimes, I regret it.

275
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:03,542
If I hadn't shown that
sweater to Mom that day...

276
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:11,422
She had knit it with great care.

277
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:17,042
So many hopes...

278
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,333
Dreams...

279
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,039
So much faith...

280
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:29,826
They seem to be more delicate
than this wool.

281
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:31,334
They fall apart so easily.

282
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,167
Look at this photograph.

283
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,791
This Doctor Uncle and me.

284
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,083
Just after Mom passed away...

285
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:58,000
I didn't speak a word all day.

286
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:01,875
I just hugged this sweater tightly.

287
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:04,375
Where is the sweater now?

288
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:31,296
Shonai?

289
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:36,125
Sis always liked to think
she was very brave.

290
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,375
She never let anyone see her sorrow.

291
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,892
Since we heard so much about
her blood being golden...

292
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:42,502
we're sure she had a heart of gold too!

293
00:20:48,392 --> 00:20:49,522
Ever heard of someone...

294
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:53,616
who sticks roses in the garbage bag
first thing in the morning?

295
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:54,733
And the reason behind it?

296
00:20:54,758 --> 00:20:57,292
To ward off the nasty smell
for the sweeper!

297
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:01,179
But problem is, the garbage picker
might think someone is proposing to him!

298
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:06,514
Don't cry, baby.

299
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:10,491
Every single day, the woman
sleeps through the entire ride...

300
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:14,534
while Sis takes care of the baby
to let the woman sleep.

301
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:20,050
And it was known to everyone
in her office that...

302
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,760
no matter how overloaded the elevator was,
it all came down to one person.

303
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,221
Offload that one person,
and the elevator would work smoothly.

304
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:29,914
And she had accepted
this fate so willingly that...

305
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,397
she thought she was doing
some great service to mankind.

306
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,546
Very slowly, very slowly.

307
00:21:34,718 --> 00:21:37,468
Look in front, look in front.

308
00:21:39,002 --> 00:21:41,227
-Good morning, ma'am.
-Good morning.

309
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,708
-I'm Swarnaja.
-Hello!

310
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,667
Hello.
Dr. Burman sent me.

311
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:47,788
Oh, right!

312
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,705
Why don't you change your clothes first?

313
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,604
Now, let's hold this posture...

314
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:54,428
and do some breathing exercises.

315
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,108
Back straight, back straight.
Okay, fine.

316
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,042
First, breathe in.
Deep breath.

317
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,542
Now hold it.

318
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:07,453
Till the count of five.
One, two, three, four, five.

319
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:08,833
Now, breathe out.

320
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:13,420
Easy, easy there.

321
00:22:13,903 --> 00:22:16,475
We'll do a bit of stretching now, okay?

322
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,662
Feet forward. Feet straight.
Okay, fine.

323
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,912
You can take my hand.

324
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:26,365
Lean stretch far as you can.

325
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:27,725
Close your eyes.

326
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,517
Hands behind your back, please.
Okay, that's fine.

327
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,875
Relax. Take it slow. No rush at all.
Okay, that's good.

328
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:36,142
Let's change positions.

329
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:37,750
Now...

330
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:41,648
Look at me.

331
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,515
That's great.

332
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:47,109
This posture is the corpse pose.

333
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:49,211
If you lie in this position...

334
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:52,836
after an exercise session...

335
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:56,000
all your muscles will feel so relaxed...

336
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,792
that you'll think that
you've stopped breathing.

337
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,735
See how's he doing the Shavasana?

338
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:04,649
Observe carefully.

339
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,958
Doesn't it look like
he's stopped breathing?

340
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,338
Relax now.
Continue.

341
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:14,020
Continue in this pose.
Just relax.

342
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:43,381
Did you have any difficulty
with Shavasana?

343
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:45,826
Did you actually stop breathing?

344
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:47,928
What?

345
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:49,545
Why should I stop breathing?

346
00:23:49,717 --> 00:23:51,748
That's what it looked like.

347
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:56,333
As if you stopped breathing completely.
And the trainer also pointed it out to me.

348
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,509
Oh.

349
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:58,876
And were you watching...

350
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,551
to see if I died from suffocation?

351
00:24:03,353 --> 00:24:04,626
-Are you okay?
-Sorry.

352
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:05,791
I'm fine. Sorry!

353
00:24:06,302 --> 00:24:11,202
I've never done yoga before this.
My sole reference is the Aastha channel!

354
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,000
Yoga is a way of life.

355
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,663
All you need is practice.

356
00:24:14,917 --> 00:24:16,296
How long have you been doing it?

357
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,265
I've been at it for about 12 years now.

358
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,356
Twelve years? Seriously?

359
00:24:20,494 --> 00:24:22,410
Wow!
No wonder!

360
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:24,160
Want some lemonade?

361
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,794
-Huh?
-Lemonade?

362
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,363
Calorie intake right after yoga?

363
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:31,958
RIght now, our metabolism rate
is as swift as a horse!

364
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:35,500
In yoga, it is said that when the
sun is overhead, even iron gets digested!

365
00:24:35,582 --> 00:24:36,197
Let's go.

366
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,042
Did you start doing yoga to lose weight?

367
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:46,917
No!

368
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,225
It's because I have low blood pressure.

369
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:51,891
Do you have any blood-related problems?

370
00:24:57,083 --> 00:25:00,125
You can try wearing
a red gem on one hand.

371
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,750
How did you know?

372
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:05,042
I read your palm.

373
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:09,875
You know palmistry?

374
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,764
Not very well. Just the basics.

375
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:13,758
My dad is a great palm reader.

376
00:25:13,829 --> 00:25:17,001
He learnt it in Kashi for seven years.

377
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:19,180
Our family business is gemstones.

378
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,139
I shifted to Kolkata a month ago.

379
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,866
Magic and magicians.
Two things children believe in greatly.

380
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:30,292
But Sis' belief in astrology
far outstrips them all!

381
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:32,142
What really confused me was...

382
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:36,577
how are things that aren't in our hands,
written in our hands?

383
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:39,458
Fate lines.
Some can read them, some can't.

384
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:42,927
And those who can,
are able to fill people's minds with hopes.

385
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:47,625
Did you know? Celestially, you're
fated for a job in communication.

386
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,282
What does 'celestially' mean?

387
00:25:49,372 --> 00:25:51,321
According to the cycle of fate.

388
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,750
I think media
is the right platform for you.

389
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:58,167
You like doing social service too, right?

390
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,451
And you will suffer setbacks for this.

391
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:05,943
You'll also earn the love of the people.

392
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,958
Why don't you try
standing for the elections?

393
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:08,976
Oh please.

394
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,125
Let me see.

395
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:14,703
Mercury's influence is strong upon you.

396
00:26:15,142 --> 00:26:17,502
-That mound is rising above the rest.
-Which is the mound?

397
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:21,481
This was enough to stir
her curiosity about Astrology.

398
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,911
As a result, it became quite annoying!

399
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,367
What are you doing?

400
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,625
Move your head!
I can't see.

401
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:34,417
Hey! Didn't Grandma say that
your birth sign is Gemini?

402
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:35,683
How will I know?

403
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:38,083
There are automatic calculations
going on here.

404
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,275
Grandma!

405
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:41,429
Grandma!

406
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:42,792
What?

407
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:46,275
My birth time 4:25 PM
on a Monday, right?

408
00:26:46,362 --> 00:26:47,362
Yes.

409
00:26:49,015 --> 00:26:52,047
All these computer calculations...

410
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,333
Are they accurate?
Are you sure?

411
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:56,750
Can't someone confirm this?

412
00:26:59,392 --> 00:27:03,432
Her smile told me that things were
rolling in a different direction.

413
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:07,706
Since then, her Astrology research
shifted from her laptop to her phone inbox.

414
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:13,000
And it didn't take long for her interest
to shift from Astrology to the astrologer!

415
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,414
WHAT'S YOUR SUNSIGN?

416
00:27:14,445 --> 00:27:15,518
AQUARIUS
YOURS?

417
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:19,480
My heart feels light
Depression, out of sight

418
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,096
I'm happy

419
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:28,334
The sun's soft rays
On my face for days and days

420
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,819
I like it

421
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:38,667
Even with feet stretched out
The ground is elusive

422
00:27:39,895 --> 00:27:42,229
With my wings spread so wide

423
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:46,632
These emotions make me want to fly away

424
00:27:46,642 --> 00:27:48,792
But my heart won't let me

425
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,083
This love is calculated

426
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:57,000
Where in history
Has anyone won the other's heart?

427
00:27:57,792 --> 00:28:00,875
These calculations don't add up

428
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:10,667
I'll call you a bit later.

429
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:12,458
What are you doing?
No more butter!

430
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,032
-This is too much rice.
-Just this much.

431
00:28:14,057 --> 00:28:16,103
Don't you know I'm on a diet?

432
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,917
-What's wrong?
-I don't like this.

433
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:20,576
-Just give her whatever she wants.
-How can I maintain my diet like this??

434
00:28:20,861 --> 00:28:24,542
-Wait, I'll serve it.
-Don't bother. I'll take it myself!

435
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:26,181
There's no need to shout!

436
00:28:26,494 --> 00:28:29,000
A dearth of flowers in nature

437
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,525
Makes the bees less hungry

438
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:37,750
A shower of light
A musical night

439
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:43,208
The magic dissipates the darkness

440
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:52,333
I'll be at peace
I the light always guides you

441
00:28:52,542 --> 00:29:00,208
I know happy days are coming
So here I am waiting

442
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:04,375
I'll not leave
Not until I live the best days of my life

443
00:29:04,432 --> 00:29:06,766
With my wings spread so wide

444
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,883
These emotions make me want to fly away

445
00:29:08,908 --> 00:29:11,058
But my heart won't let me

446
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,374
This love is calculated

447
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:19,575
Where in history
Has anyone won the other's heart?

448
00:29:19,812 --> 00:29:22,250
Dreams are the only currency

449
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:23,885
With my wings spread so wide

450
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:24,953
Hi!

451
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,224
Hi.

452
00:29:28,764 --> 00:29:31,623
-Some coffee?
-Coffe's good. Thank you.

453
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:37,226
Where in history
Has anyone won the other's heart?

454
00:29:37,623 --> 00:29:40,726
Dreams are the only currency

455
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:05,750
What are you doing
out in the dark here?

456
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,625
Can I ask you a question?

457
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:11,250
If it's about Astrology,
I can't help you.

458
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,500
Consult an astrologer for that.

459
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,667
It's not about Astrology!
Sit down.

460
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,167
Say...

461
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:27,792
Say two people have fallen in love...
But neither can say it out loud.

462
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:33,708
If the girl proposes first,
won't it look very desperate?

463
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,655
You're still stuck
in your ancient Astrology world!

464
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,794
In these modern times,
no one cares who proposes first.

465
00:30:39,855 --> 00:30:42,735
In the Chandtala case,
it was the wife who filed for divorce.

466
00:30:42,831 --> 00:30:45,500
And you're telling me
you can't propose first?

467
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,125
Please stop here.

468
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:50,793
Thank you.

469
00:30:54,848 --> 00:30:56,320
-Bye.
-Bye.

470
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:03,750
Shammo...

471
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:11,452
I think it's best
if I tell you something...

472
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,833
Tell me.

473
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:24,375
I've started having feelings for you.

474
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:39,375
Won't you say anything?

475
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:41,333
You're really quiet.

476
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:47,583
You can take your time, of course.

477
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:56,503
Hello?

478
00:31:56,538 --> 00:31:57,917
Where are you?

479
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,500
When are you returning?

480
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,792
I'm on my way. Driving.

481
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,333
Alright.

482
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,833
Swarnaja.

483
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:39,292
I feel like kicking myself
for telling Sis about modern times and all.

484
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:43,083
If she'd waited a bit, she'd have found
out about the astrologer's wife.

485
00:32:43,538 --> 00:32:46,705
Anyone else would've brought the sky down
on his head by now!

486
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:51,673
But after a few days of silence,
she gave him a piece of her mind!

487
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:53,776
Don't bother me, Shammo.

488
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:55,989
I know you intentionally avoided
mentioning your wife.

489
00:32:56,033 --> 00:32:56,955
No...

490
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,917
And that was the reason you
avoided clicking photos with me.

491
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:04,506
Anyway, I'll stay away from you,
yoga and your stupid Astrology!

492
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:10,925
But I wasn't very unhappy
with the way things turned out.

493
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,708
Honestly, what happened,
happened for the best.

494
00:33:15,815 --> 00:33:18,917
Sis finally thought 'Enough is enough'!

495
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:28,375
The baby cries while the mother sleeps.
This can't go on anymore!

496
00:33:34,352 --> 00:33:36,056
Time is precious for all.

497
00:33:36,443 --> 00:33:38,750
Being good-natured
isn't a sign of stupidity.

498
00:33:39,082 --> 00:33:40,792
First come, first serve.

499
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:42,192
It's as simple as that!

500
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,504
Get off!
What are you looking at?

501
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,313
Even the gods weren't spared.

502
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:55,292
If the devotee is disgruntled,
the value of devotion drops.

503
00:33:56,458 --> 00:34:00,202
But the biggest and most
economic change that happened...

504
00:34:00,273 --> 00:34:05,500
was that she stopped spending
on making garbage bags smell nicer.

505
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:10,250
Hey! Aren't you going for yoga class?

506
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,458
What about yoga class?
You're just lying around!

507
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:13,966
-No.
-Why?

508
00:34:14,026 --> 00:34:15,792
Mom! What a rascal he is!

509
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:17,375
-Who?
-The garbage collector.

510
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:19,814
I didn't like the look of him
the past few days.

511
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:25,245
Today he asked me why I didn't
leave flowers out for him as usual.

512
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:27,555
The nerve of him!

513
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:34,583
Hello?

514
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:37,583
Hello? Am I speaking to Swarnaja?

515
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:38,766
Yes. Who is this?

516
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:40,760
My name is Kheya.

517
00:34:40,814 --> 00:34:42,654
I'm Shammo's wife.

518
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,125
I know you're a very busy person...

519
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:51,292
But will it be possible to meet once?

520
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,250
Meet me? Why?

521
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,333
I'll tell you when we meet?

522
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:01,690
Where?

523
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:06,024
Will it be too much to ask you
to come to my house?

524
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:07,326
Sorry, but I can't.

525
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:09,286
Alright, alright!

526
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:12,404
Somewhere outside.
Wherever you want.

527
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,422
Who is it?

528
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:20,542
Thanks.

529
00:35:23,566 --> 00:35:25,024
Anything else, ma'am?

530
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:00,833
I'm so sorry!
I've kept you waiting for so long.

531
00:37:00,858 --> 00:37:03,208
-Actually, my driver is...
-No, it's okay.

532
00:37:08,915 --> 00:37:10,917
Can I have a word with you...

533
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:12,708
in private?

534
00:37:15,563 --> 00:37:17,417
It's okay. You can speak freely
in front of him.

535
00:37:17,514 --> 00:37:18,596
Okay.

536
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:21,935
I heard what you told Shammo
over the phone that day.

537
00:37:21,975 --> 00:37:24,458
The phone was on speaker.

538
00:37:25,985 --> 00:37:27,394
Sis. The washroom?

539
00:37:32,286 --> 00:37:35,542
Look, it's best if we clear up
some things before starting.

540
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:37,000
For formality's sake.

541
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,063
No! What you said was absolutely correct!

542
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:42,875
Absolutely correct!
I'd have done the same!

543
00:37:44,065 --> 00:37:45,542
But I still think...

544
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:48,875
you're making a mistake, Swarnaja.

545
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:51,708
You're misunderstanding Shammo.

546
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,805
Please don't misunderstand him.

547
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:55,762
I don't think I misunderstood him.

548
00:37:56,055 --> 00:37:57,292
We girls tend to understand...

549
00:37:57,292 --> 00:37:58,685
That's what I'm saying!

550
00:37:58,847 --> 00:38:01,902
I'm saying that as a woman.

551
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:04,935
Since that day, Shammo has refused
to go to yoga class at all!

552
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:10,187
When you two would chat
about Astrology...

553
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,208
late into the night...

554
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:16,458
I told him to go out with you.
I wanted to ease the tension.

555
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:18,865
What was I to do?
Thanks to me, he can't go anywhere.

556
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:22,417
Just home, office and work.
Every single day! Who likes that?

557
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:30,125
He's my husband.
I know him inside and out.

558
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,750
Please don't misunderstand him.

559
00:38:38,058 --> 00:38:40,814
I've heard your show.
I follow it regularly!

560
00:38:40,854 --> 00:38:43,955
You say whatever is on your mind,
whether on the radio or over the phone.

561
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,042
Did you recently have a leg operation?

562
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:48,975
Nope. This is permanent.

563
00:38:49,175 --> 00:38:50,750
I'll go to heaven in this wheelchair!

564
00:38:51,953 --> 00:38:53,415
Why? What happened to you?

565
00:38:53,645 --> 00:38:55,670
I met with an accident 10 years ago...

566
00:38:55,755 --> 00:38:58,585
My pelvic region was shattered.

567
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:01,175
Since then, I've been traveling
the world in this chair.

568
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,993
I don't want to brag,
but I can cook very well!

569
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:07,292
I can also do herbal facials.

570
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:09,453
And I can sing quite well too.

571
00:39:09,534 --> 00:39:13,553
So, I know exactly how to dispel
the anger of a beautiful woman.

572
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:18,625
So, what'll you have?

573
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,958
I've never seen a wheelchair-bound person
so bright and happy before.

574
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:26,167
I knew in my mind...

575
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:31,458
that my sister's attempts to become tougher
would soon soften just as quickly!

576
00:39:37,372 --> 00:39:41,367
The friendship with the astrologer's wife
grew from coffee shop to social media.

577
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:44,458
The family had something to say
about that also.

578
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:48,667
Now you're chatting with
that guy's wife?

579
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:50,625
This is too much, Shonai.

580
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,500
Swarnaja, listen to me...

581
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:55,125
Your rival can never
be your friend for long.

582
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,667
Sis didn't heed their words, of course.

583
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:51,536
But through the jokes and laughter,
she discovered something...

584
00:40:52,042 --> 00:40:55,074
There is a void
in the astrologer's family.

585
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:59,264
Kheya looks cheerful on the outside
but there's darkness inside.

586
00:40:59,264 --> 00:41:00,384
What happened?

587
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:08,292
Let's see.

588
00:41:08,292 --> 00:41:09,375
It looks fantastic!

589
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:11,792
Lock the wheel.

590
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:14,745
Thanks.

591
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:21,712
Oh! I'm so excited!

592
00:41:22,792 --> 00:41:24,392
(indistinct chatter)

593
00:41:28,114 --> 00:41:29,213
Hi.

594
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,174
It's very late. I'll come again.

595
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:38,958
Shall I keep it here?

596
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,542
See you.
Bye!

597
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,455
Wow.

598
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:58,125
Did the girl make this at home?

599
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:01,375
Grandma, 'the girl' has a name.
It's Kheya.

600
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,250
Very strong-willed, I must say.

601
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:06,623
You know?

602
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:11,083
This is even better than
the stuff you buy from the market.

603
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,475
Kolkata traffic is moving smoothly...

604
00:42:13,495 --> 00:42:16,503
except for the Park Street area,
where the Christmas cheer is still on.

605
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,000
Make sure to leave with time
in hand if you take that route

606
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,333
because if you get stuck,
you'll remember my warnings!

607
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:22,875
And we have our next caller! Hello?

608
00:42:23,044 --> 00:42:24,044
Hello?

609
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,792
Hi! Where are you calling from?

610
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:28,844
I've got a "whatever I want" type of story.
Can I say it?

611
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:31,874
Of course you can! But first,
where you calling from?

612
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,542
I'm calling from Uluberia.

613
00:42:33,615 --> 00:42:35,250
My name is Sajal Maity.

614
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:38,375
Okay Sajal, tell me
whatever story you want to.

615
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:41,458
My friend and I were completely drunk!

616
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:45,323
And I was getting calls and texts
from an unknown number.

617
00:42:45,493 --> 00:42:49,012
So I called back and it was a girl!
We both kept flirting with each other.

618
00:42:49,084 --> 00:42:53,301
Next day, I found out it was my girlfriend,
calling from her father's phone!

619
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,985
What then? Breakup?

620
00:42:55,135 --> 00:42:56,195
No, we didn't break up.

621
00:42:56,265 --> 00:42:58,625
But she blocked me for a month!

622
00:42:58,974 --> 00:43:01,958
She was in tears
and threatened to commit suicide!

623
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:03,113
And then?

624
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:08,326
She didn't commit suicide, but she
blocked me everywhere for a month!

625
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:10,958
Thank you, Sajal!
Thank you so much!

626
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,708
Sajal is lucky his girlfriend got back
with him even after a month.

627
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:19,417
If you also have stories like this,
please share them with us!

628
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:23,333
You know our number.
For now, here's a breakup song.

629
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:37,250
Hello? What happened?

630
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:40,458
Sorry to disturb you
but it's an emergency.

631
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:43,708
The Doctor Uncle you talked about,
can I get his number?

632
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:45,292
It's a bit personal.

633
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,000
I don't know anyone here.

634
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:48,542
Why? What happened?

635
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:50,667
Last night, Kheya overdosed
on sleeping pills...

636
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:51,722
What?

637
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:54,841
Kheya attempted suicide with
sleeping pills last night.

638
00:43:55,042 --> 00:43:56,875
Can you please give me
your doctor's number?

639
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,425
I'll send it right now!

640
00:43:58,542 --> 00:44:00,625
I'll come over as soon as
office gets over, okay?

641
00:44:10,728 --> 00:44:12,900
DOCTOR UNCLE

642
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:29,542
Doctor Uncle, how is she?

643
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,601
She had taken 10-12 pills last night.

644
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:33,625
I've given her an injection.
She's sleeping now.

645
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:37,500
Does she need to be hospitalised?

646
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:40,042
We have to wait for 24 hours either way.

647
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:42,333
I've told him to keep an eye on her.

648
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,833
Let's see.

649
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,708
Won't you come inside?

650
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,152
I haven't told you this but...

651
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:23,409
After a lot of fighting and searching...

652
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:26,167
I'd arranged a surrogate mother for Kheya.

653
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:27,784
Maybe you don't know this...

654
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:30,417
but Kheya can never give birth.

655
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:33,292
Ten years ago...

656
00:45:35,792 --> 00:45:38,458
her uterus had to be
removed due to an accident.

657
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:42,000
I offered a woman money
in return for this.

658
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:45,973
Last evening, she called
and said she was already pregnant.

659
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:49,250
She's carrying her own child.

660
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,917
Kheya became depressed
upon hearing this.

661
00:45:57,167 --> 00:45:58,250
I should go.

662
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:12,958
What's this?

663
00:46:13,792 --> 00:46:14,875
What's what?

664
00:46:16,917 --> 00:46:18,458
The red sweater.

665
00:46:19,023 --> 00:46:20,202
Oh!

666
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,570
Kheya knitted it.

667
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:24,625
She knitted many more.

668
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:27,500
All for her child.

669
00:46:28,042 --> 00:46:29,708
One for each day of the week!

670
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:37,000
I'm leaving.

671
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:41,371
How could you take such
a huge decision by yourself?

672
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:43,723
I'm going to leave the house, Shonai!

673
00:47:43,917 --> 00:47:47,458
Your mother too did as she wished,
and now she's gone and left me alone!

674
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:49,708
At least you have to think about me.

675
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:53,203
Swarnaja, listen...

676
00:47:53,292 --> 00:47:55,287
Please don't do this!

677
00:47:55,326 --> 00:47:57,428
Think about your future husband...

678
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,545
the father of your child.
Think about how he will feel.

679
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,593
How can you think about
bearing someone else's child?

680
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:07,921
-Please listen to me!
-Uff!

681
00:48:09,065 --> 00:48:10,565
Yes, it's a noble thought.

682
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:14,648
-Thank you.
-But you just joined work.

683
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,437
It hasn't even been a year.

684
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,958
You have to think
about what you aspire to be.

685
00:48:19,667 --> 00:48:21,000
A surrogate mother?

686
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:24,500
Or an RJ at
India's number one radio station?

687
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,210
Out of the question!

688
00:48:27,917 --> 00:48:29,043
How dare you?

689
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:31,500
How could you even think it?

690
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:33,983
Don't you know your own problems?

691
00:48:35,054 --> 00:48:36,054
Hey!

692
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:38,833
Are you messing around with me?

693
00:48:42,778 --> 00:48:45,444
Doctor Uncle, won't I ever be a mother?

694
00:48:47,682 --> 00:48:49,388
Those with golden blood...

695
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:51,500
Can they never become mothers?

696
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,917
We'll find out when you decide
to have your own child.

697
00:48:54,917 --> 00:48:58,375
I won't let you take this life risk
for a person you barely know.

698
00:48:58,917 --> 00:49:00,250
I can't!

699
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,875
This is not a salary incentive that
you just hand out to anyone you like.

700
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:07,792
It's a matter of the rarest blood.

701
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:12,625
Do you know the meaning of surrogacy?

702
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:15,458
You're renting out your womb.

703
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:19,625
You'll be a mother for only 9 months.
After that, they'll take the child away.

704
00:49:19,862 --> 00:49:21,176
And what will you have?

705
00:49:22,464 --> 00:49:23,611
Life risk.

706
00:49:24,473 --> 00:49:26,890
You might live, you might die.
No way!

707
00:49:29,864 --> 00:49:32,239
This is the problem
with you all, Doctor Uncle.

708
00:49:32,723 --> 00:49:36,557
You'll preach to the young,
but never practice what you preach.

709
00:49:37,997 --> 00:49:41,024
It's always better
if your neighbour is the martyr.

710
00:49:44,723 --> 00:49:46,015
I'm golden blooded...

711
00:49:46,476 --> 00:49:48,184
but I'll still be a surrogate mother.

712
00:49:48,209 --> 00:49:49,305
Shonai.

713
00:49:49,417 --> 00:49:50,292
Shonai!

714
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:02,182
She started dreaming once again.

715
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:08,292
What people didn't understand is that
Sis wanted to do this for herself.

716
00:50:09,292 --> 00:50:13,127
Dreams aren't as delicate
as the wool of a sweater.

717
00:50:13,198 --> 00:50:15,531
She wanted to prove this to herself.

718
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:05,667
As her belly grew bigger, our family
had to come to terms with it.

719
00:51:05,848 --> 00:51:09,328
But those who were unsupportive
of her decision before...

720
00:51:09,492 --> 00:51:11,576
completely changed their tune now!

721
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:14,341
Yes.
The neighbourhood people are saying...

722
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,417
that my granddaughter
is made of steel!

723
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:18,000
She's a responsible girl.

724
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,042
That she is.

725
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:20,417
You needlessly worry for her.

726
00:51:20,417 --> 00:51:22,042
Not everyone has such a big heart.

727
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:23,792
Not to mention her courage.

728
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:24,631
Of course!

729
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,001
I say that all girls should
learn from this.

730
00:51:27,174 --> 00:51:29,340
There's no need to be terrified.

731
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:32,410
Terrified of society, in-laws
and even your own parents!

732
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:36,214
Swarnaja has taught them all a lesson!
Rubbed it in all their faces!

733
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:37,917
Her life...

734
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:39,543
this journey she's on...

735
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:42,208
would make for very interesting content.

736
00:51:42,417 --> 00:51:45,042
-Let's go for it.
-Yes, but what about the budget?

737
00:51:45,132 --> 00:51:47,090
That's all well and good...

738
00:51:47,708 --> 00:51:52,042
but what if there's controversy?
What if someone badmouths us?

739
00:51:52,595 --> 00:51:55,125
-Are we ready to handle that?
-Surrogacy itself is interesting concept.

740
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:58,329
-I understand that...
-And a Mirchi RJ is going through it.

741
00:51:58,542 --> 00:52:00,583
A Mirchi RJ is becoming a surrogate mother!

742
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:02,627
That itself is interesting content!
That's why I'm saying.

743
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:05,159
-And you're sure about that?
-Absolutely.

744
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:27,380
The Queen said,
"Dear child, I have everything there.

745
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:29,536
I have seven palaces...

746
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:31,349
seven hundred servants...

747
00:52:31,458 --> 00:52:33,375
seven vaults full of jewels...

748
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:35,333
seven gardens...

749
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:40,098
And in one of those seven palaces,
lived the king's youngest queen.

750
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:42,082
My only...

751
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:44,625
Hey! Are you listening?

752
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:17,508
And soon, that day arrived.

753
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,069
Everyone was at the same place...

754
00:53:20,133 --> 00:53:21,608
but nobody was talking.

755
00:53:21,909 --> 00:53:24,413
Everyone has questions in their mind.

756
00:53:24,717 --> 00:53:26,155
They want to ask.

757
00:53:26,499 --> 00:53:29,911
They even look at one another
but they can't ask them.

758
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,817
And like shy newlyweds,
they lower their gaze.

759
00:53:41,943 --> 00:53:44,435
(indistinct chatter)

760
00:53:45,203 --> 00:53:47,432
(kids playing)

761
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,039
God bless her!

762
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,757
Congratulations, ma'am.
You've given birth to a beautiful baby boy.

763
00:54:32,595 --> 00:54:34,642
He looks adorable in that sweater.

764
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:37,852
It's as if it was made for him.

765
00:54:41,025 --> 00:54:42,983
What will you do from tomorrow?

766
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:44,826
I'll go back to my old life.

767
00:54:45,595 --> 00:54:48,553
I'll join office again
instead of wasting a whole month.

768
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:50,983
Won't you feel sad?

769
00:54:51,483 --> 00:54:54,317
After two months, you must know
his moods and habits by heart.

770
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:57,568
Eleven months...

771
00:54:58,067 --> 00:55:00,067
nine months inside, two months outside.

772
00:55:00,442 --> 00:55:03,233
Will he never find out
that you're his actual mother?

773
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:06,200
What's the situation here?

774
00:55:08,775 --> 00:55:11,714
I'm just spending
my last day with this little rascal!

775
00:55:13,452 --> 00:55:16,536
Let me check your blood pressure.

776
00:55:20,368 --> 00:55:22,972
It's time to look after yourself now.

777
00:55:26,707 --> 00:55:30,165
Don't get too attached to the kid.

778
00:55:30,965 --> 00:55:33,923
Let him get accustomed to his legal mother.

779
00:55:34,608 --> 00:55:37,150
Where is he? Let's see him!

780
00:55:38,198 --> 00:55:39,980
-Let's see!
-He just woke up.

781
00:55:40,358 --> 00:55:41,650
Oh my!

782
00:55:41,981 --> 00:55:44,464
That sweater is lovely!
Is it hand-knitted?

783
00:55:45,317 --> 00:55:46,480
Shonai...

784
00:55:46,858 --> 00:55:48,160
I'll see you later.

785
00:55:48,733 --> 00:55:50,483
Take care of yourself.

786
00:55:51,608 --> 00:55:53,317
Can you come over tomorrow?

787
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,000
Tomorrow?

788
00:55:55,192 --> 00:55:56,430
Why?

789
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:58,407
Since the little one is leaving...

790
00:55:58,469 --> 00:56:00,688
I thought we could have
a nice parting meal together.

791
00:56:01,841 --> 00:56:03,132
I can't.

792
00:56:04,017 --> 00:56:06,696
I've got a lot of work tomorrow,
so it'll be difficult.

793
00:56:07,142 --> 00:56:08,142
You...

794
00:56:09,817 --> 00:56:12,461
go ahead without me.
You see me almost every day.

795
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:14,844
See you.

796
00:56:15,275 --> 00:56:18,067
Hey, have a taste and see how it is.

797
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:19,275
What is it?

798
00:56:21,681 --> 00:56:23,118
-Rice pudding?
-Here you go.

799
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,692
What rice is this, Auntie?
Tulaipanji?

800
00:56:28,692 --> 00:56:29,767
Yes.

801
00:56:29,817 --> 00:56:30,983
But how did you know?

802
00:56:30,983 --> 00:56:32,860
I grew up eating this rice!

803
00:56:32,942 --> 00:56:34,048
Why did you make pudding?

804
00:56:34,108 --> 00:56:37,263
For the little one.
Since he's leaving tomorrow.

805
00:56:37,329 --> 00:56:39,466
Tomorrow is an auspicious day.

806
00:56:39,491 --> 00:56:40,911
It is the Kalpataru Festival.

807
00:56:40,936 --> 00:56:45,241
Mom, the vegetables look done.
Should I stir them up a bit?

808
00:56:45,386 --> 00:56:47,140
Yes. Go on, I'll be with you.

809
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,733
-You want some more?
-No, thank you. Maybe later.

810
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:54,410
You could have stayed back
a few more days.

811
00:56:55,926 --> 00:56:58,958
Shammo is under a lot of pressure
during shifting.

812
00:56:58,983 --> 00:57:01,467
If I can't at least help out
with the cooking...

813
00:57:02,817 --> 00:57:04,400
Did you hear, little one?

814
00:57:04,483 --> 00:57:07,317
Your mother loves your father
more than you!

815
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:10,873
I'm speaking from my heart...

816
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,324
I'm indebted to you
for what you've done for us.

817
00:57:14,567 --> 00:57:16,449
I can never repay this debt.

818
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:17,535
Come on.

819
00:57:17,793 --> 00:57:19,959
It was the most humane thing to do.

820
00:57:20,264 --> 00:57:22,784
You are unnecessarily pessimistic
about this world.

821
00:57:24,045 --> 00:57:27,042
To mask our sadness
at the little one's departure...

822
00:57:27,209 --> 00:57:30,015
we ate and made merry that night.

823
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:32,215
We were trying to convince each other...

824
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,062
that they felt no sadness at this.

825
00:58:06,064 --> 00:58:07,407
Careful...

826
00:58:20,967 --> 00:58:22,458
Can I...

827
00:58:27,692 --> 00:58:28,942
What is it?

828
00:58:29,959 --> 00:58:32,345
Okay, alright.
Relax. Calm down.

829
00:58:34,634 --> 00:58:35,822
What happened?

830
00:58:38,277 --> 00:58:39,485
Why is he crying?

831
00:58:39,525 --> 00:58:40,537
Is he hungry?

832
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:42,400
No, he can't be.
I just fed him a while back.

833
00:58:43,064 --> 00:58:45,006
-Wait. Let me.
-Careful...

834
00:58:50,108 --> 00:58:51,448
Hey there, little one.

835
00:59:32,758 --> 00:59:33,949
Grandma!

836
00:59:34,217 --> 00:59:35,934
Grandma! Bani!

837
00:59:35,967 --> 00:59:38,592
-What happened?
-Have they left? They didn't say anything!

838
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:40,054
I don't know. I was asleep.

839
00:59:40,133 --> 00:59:42,109
I don't see their bags or anything!

840
00:59:42,217 --> 00:59:44,912
They were supposed to eat before leaving...

841
00:59:44,937 --> 00:59:46,195
What happened?

842
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,050
What is it?

843
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,383
Have they left?
I can't see their bags anywhere!

844
00:59:49,842 --> 00:59:51,096
Call them.

845
00:59:51,217 --> 00:59:53,331
-Maybe there was some emergency.
-Yes, hurry.

846
00:59:56,365 --> 00:59:57,381
Hello?

847
00:59:57,911 --> 00:59:59,661
Why did you leave all of a sudden?

848
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,107
Without saying anything?

849
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,560
Uh, yeah...

850
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:05,967
You were sleeping,
so I didn't want to wake you.

851
01:00:07,552 --> 01:00:11,270
After what happened last night,
today's goodbye would have been...

852
01:00:11,301 --> 01:00:12,186
very painful for you.

853
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:16,318
And besides,
after an incident last night...

854
01:00:16,754 --> 01:00:18,646
Kheya is in low spirits right now.

855
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:20,885
Please don't misunderstand me.

856
01:00:21,133 --> 01:00:24,012
I know you're feeling sad,
but what was I to do?

857
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,363
Hello?

858
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:27,111
Hello?

859
01:00:49,295 --> 01:00:54,583
Lonely are the tunes
From this monochord

860
01:00:54,765 --> 01:00:57,901
In the raw light of day

861
01:00:58,031 --> 01:01:03,030
All they are looking for
In a drunken haze

862
01:01:03,055 --> 01:01:05,804
Is the touch of rain

863
01:01:05,897 --> 01:01:12,313
Those difficult calculations
They were my doom

864
01:01:16,553 --> 01:01:26,162
What more can I ask for?

865
01:01:26,425 --> 01:01:32,061
Will these signs give me the proof I need?

866
01:01:32,669 --> 01:01:37,257
While I try to fan away
The encroaching darkness?

867
01:01:37,719 --> 01:01:42,328
If you can
Then teach me how to love

868
01:01:45,844 --> 01:01:51,312
Bless me with wings
So that I may fly again

869
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:56,205
For every cloud has a silver linings

870
01:01:57,568 --> 01:02:02,421
We can make delicate paper boats

871
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:08,300
But we can also break hearts

872
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:17,879
What more can I ask for?

873
01:02:19,085 --> 01:02:23,672
I don't think you'll want to wait any more

874
01:02:23,719 --> 01:02:24,907
(cheering)

875
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:30,050
The darkness in my mind
Seems to have lessened

876
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:35,432
If you can
Then teach me to love that

877
01:02:35,675 --> 01:02:41,078
In my garden
A horrible tune hangs on my lips

878
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:46,758
Disturbing your sleep
like an alarm ring

879
01:02:46,976 --> 01:02:52,351
Let the soft light remain
Within my breast

880
01:02:52,557 --> 01:02:57,640
I'll paint your playful face
In water colours

881
01:02:58,061 --> 01:03:03,144
I'll paint your playful face
In water colours

882
01:03:03,581 --> 01:03:09,807
I'll paint your playful face
In water colours

883
01:03:20,323 --> 01:03:23,281
-Oh no! What happened?
-Oh God! Is she dead?

884
01:03:23,419 --> 01:03:26,377
(indistinct yelling)

885
01:03:47,917 --> 01:03:48,942
Hello? This is Mirchi Swarnaja.

886
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:51,112
How can I send a letter to God?

887
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:54,050
You hung up the previous day,
and you didn't leave us your contact details.

888
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:56,833
Where are you calling from?
Where do you stay?

889
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:57,750
Home.

890
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:02,042
Alright! And who else stays at your home?
Mom, dad, grandpa, grandma?

891
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:03,708
Have you shared your thoughts
with anyone?

892
01:04:03,792 --> 01:04:04,572
Hey!

893
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:06,952
Why are you on the phone?

894
01:04:07,234 --> 01:04:08,006
Huh?

895
01:04:08,031 --> 01:04:09,862
Come on! Now you'll be in trouble.

896
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,667
Preliminary reports suggest that
road visibility was low due to heavy rains.

897
01:04:14,792 --> 01:04:18,414
Local police officer, S. Chowdhury said

898
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,680
that the accident happened
on Wednesday night

899
01:04:21,715 --> 01:04:25,570
But the police got to know about it
on Thursday morning.

900
01:04:25,848 --> 01:04:30,473
The local residents were the first
responders on the scene.

901
01:04:30,498 --> 01:04:34,207
The plug point in my room has been dead
three days now! No one bothers to fix it.

902
01:04:34,653 --> 01:04:36,498
Can't you see we're watching the news?
And you're talking--

903
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:39,549
can't help it.
I'm getting late for work.

904
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:43,838
Yesterday morning,
on the Eastern Bypass near Mukundapur

905
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:47,000
a truck ran into and killed a pedestrian.

906
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,249
The victim, a woman, was taken
from the site to a private hospital

907
01:04:51,292 --> 01:04:54,054
where she was pronounced dead.

908
01:04:54,167 --> 01:05:01,295
Eyewitnesses say the victim was running
from another woman, Seema Parwal.

909
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:06,445
After questioning her, the police
revealed the victim's name to be Ankita Sen.

910
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:09,583
The police investigation department
has disclosed

911
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:14,101
that Ankita and her missing husband
are known child smugglers.

912
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,585
For the last 10 years, they have been...

913
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:18,708
Isn't that Kheya?

914
01:05:18,708 --> 01:05:20,958
...involved with child smuggling.

915
01:05:21,261 --> 01:05:24,886
Two years ago, Seema Parwal
had legally agreed...

916
01:05:24,917 --> 01:05:29,984
to be a surrogate mother
for Ankita and her husband.

917
01:05:30,304 --> 01:05:35,375
To combat this atrocity, the government
has been urged to form a committee

918
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:38,528
by several child welfare and rights groups.

919
01:05:38,791 --> 01:05:41,041
We'll we back after a short break.

920
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,208
Let's ask him.

921
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,417
Stay calm.

922
01:05:50,417 --> 01:05:51,875
How can I file a complaint?

923
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:53,208
Not now.
You'll have to wait.

924
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,625
Let's go sit.

925
01:05:54,927 --> 01:05:56,344
Why? What are you doing?

926
01:05:57,458 --> 01:05:59,083
Listen, I work in the media...

927
01:05:59,125 --> 01:06:00,417
What's wrong?

928
01:06:01,299 --> 01:06:02,924
My child is missing.

929
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:04,346
Since when?

930
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:06,533
It's been five years now.

931
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:13,586
What have you been doing for so long?
Waiting?

932
01:06:13,729 --> 01:06:15,104
The child will grow up...

933
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:17,250
Return to you...
And it'll be all over the media?

934
01:06:17,792 --> 01:06:19,208
Result of a teenage pregnancy?

935
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,254
-How dare you? You can't talk...
-Buzz off.

936
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:22,583
Go and wait!

937
01:06:22,667 --> 01:06:25,793
Kid's been missing five years,
and now she comes to report it!

938
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:27,458
-I'll make the entry when I have time.
-Come this way.

939
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:28,667
-What are you...
-Hey! Stop!

940
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:31,370
Hey! Wait! Stop! Hey!

941
01:06:34,042 --> 01:06:35,667
Go out!
Sorry, Sir.

942
01:06:35,917 --> 01:06:37,250
I've been telling you to wait!

943
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:39,708
You can't go barging in.
This isn't your house.

944
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,458
Get out of here!

945
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:43,973
Let's go.

946
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:08,928
Tell me... What is the problem?

947
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:11,125
Do you know anything about this?

948
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:16,330
Yes. I saw in the afternoon news.

949
01:07:16,354 --> 01:07:18,283
They're saying
it's an international racket.

950
01:07:18,417 --> 01:07:20,875
How are you related to this?

951
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:24,536
Five years ago,
I became a surrogate mother to their baby.

952
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,731
He had a sharper jawline...

953
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:34,250
He had less than shoulder length hair...

954
01:07:36,167 --> 01:07:39,322
-Sharper nose...
-His eyes were narrower...

955
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:41,167
This looks more like him...

956
01:07:41,167 --> 01:07:44,538
The two numbers you gave me
are registered under different names.

957
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:47,554
Shammo and Kheya Sengupta don't exist.

958
01:07:48,042 --> 01:07:49,335
And Ms. Parwal...

959
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:53,343
who chased Kheya before her accident,
gave the police a different name.

960
01:07:53,792 --> 01:07:57,167
Do you have any other references
with which we can track him?

961
01:07:59,705 --> 01:08:00,705
Yes.

962
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:04,743
When I saw it on TV, I was really scared.

963
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:08,922
The news mentioned a different name,
but you're saying her name was Kheya?

964
01:08:09,292 --> 01:08:10,859
What name did they give you?

965
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:13,297
The names they gave me were...

966
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:15,375
Sayani Biswas and...

967
01:08:15,667 --> 01:08:18,333
Pradyut Biswas.
From Bombay.

968
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:23,404
You see, I don't like to poke my nose
into the affairs of my tenants.

969
01:08:23,902 --> 01:08:26,466
But the pair lived quite peacefully.

970
01:08:27,933 --> 01:08:30,517
I need information for a case
from five years ago.

971
01:08:30,542 --> 01:08:32,779
Of course, sir.
Please ask at next counter.

972
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:37,042
I need to access an old case.
Shammo and Kheya Sengupta.

973
01:08:37,042 --> 01:08:39,958
I wasn't here then, sir.
I just joined recently.

974
01:08:39,958 --> 01:08:42,625
Go and find me the case data files. Fast!

975
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:45,007
-Sir, can you please give me a few minutes?
-Immediately!

976
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:48,320
We keep KYC documents.

977
01:08:48,483 --> 01:08:50,273
PAN card, Voter ID card and...

978
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:52,458
the Adhaar card didn't exist back then.

979
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:55,502
Ma'am, yours has your signature on it.

980
01:08:58,877 --> 01:09:01,338
Oh! This is the address of a rented house.

981
01:09:02,083 --> 01:09:03,708
The whole thing is a forgery.

982
01:09:05,676 --> 01:09:08,346
No, sir. I checked again.

983
01:09:08,417 --> 01:09:11,284
There's no one here
by the name of Shammo Sengupta.

984
01:09:12,925 --> 01:09:18,049
The biggest news now is that Kolkata police
is on to a child smuggling case.

985
01:09:18,105 --> 01:09:23,729
Wednesday evening, Ankita Sen AKA
Kheya Sengupta died in a freak accident.

986
01:09:23,808 --> 01:09:25,808
That's when this racket was discovered.

987
01:09:25,901 --> 01:09:30,502
The detective department believes
this is an international racket.

988
01:09:30,589 --> 01:09:35,809
The woman's husband, the mastermind
of the racket, is currently missing.

989
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:39,083
Whatever details Mrs. Parwal gave to
the police about them...

990
01:09:39,125 --> 01:09:41,958
All these ID proofs...

991
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:43,417
They're all fake.

992
01:09:43,557 --> 01:09:45,251
I can't even believe it!

993
01:09:45,792 --> 01:09:51,989
Their method is to pretend to be a couple
and find a willing, surrogate mother.

994
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:56,500
Then they'll use fake IDs and
fake documents to obtain the child.

995
01:09:56,742 --> 01:10:01,229
And then sell the child to foreign
companies for medical experimentation.

996
01:10:01,277 --> 01:10:04,370
Medical experiments as in?

997
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:12,232
Like rats and guinea pigs
are experimented on.

998
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,524
In the case of
expensive medicines and drugs...

999
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,876
testing is done on human subjects.

1000
01:10:17,917 --> 01:10:20,625
It's fine if the subject is an adult.
They can give their consent...

1001
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:23,333
sign a bond,
obviously against monetary compensation.

1002
01:10:23,366 --> 01:10:24,982
But if the subject is a child...

1003
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:28,083
kidnap is the only option.

1004
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:32,379
If it boils down to kidnapping,
then why surrogacy?

1005
01:10:32,456 --> 01:10:35,488
If it's a kidnapping,
there will be police investigation.

1006
01:10:36,012 --> 01:10:39,679
But surrogacy means the child is their own,
so no need for an investigation.

1007
01:10:39,866 --> 01:10:42,456
I don't want to know all that!
I want my child back! At any cost!

1008
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:45,058
I will go to the court,
media houses, whatever!

1009
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:48,257
-I'll find him with or without your help--
-Alright, listen. Please.

1010
01:10:48,417 --> 01:10:52,500
Do you have any photos of him?

1011
01:10:54,408 --> 01:10:56,168
No, Shammo want to take photos.

1012
01:10:56,382 --> 01:10:58,273
There was one image of him
on Kheya's Facebook profile.

1013
01:10:58,296 --> 01:10:59,976
Now that's been deleted.

1014
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:02,304
Hey, Sis...

1015
01:11:02,366 --> 01:11:06,437
didn't we take a group photo
that last day on Grandma's phone?

1016
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:08,483
Oh my!

1017
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:10,833
Please give me your phone.

1018
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:13,042
-My phone? Why?
-I need it!

1019
01:11:13,366 --> 01:11:14,433
In my bedroom.

1020
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,854
Please come in, sir.

1021
01:11:18,917 --> 01:11:20,125
-Hello.
-Hello.

1022
01:11:41,723 --> 01:11:43,870
His face is away from the camera.

1023
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,458
Hello, sir?

1024
01:11:48,625 --> 01:11:50,660
A report just came in.

1025
01:11:50,917 --> 01:11:53,167
A child. Between four and five years old.

1026
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:55,042
The same blood group.

1027
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:57,733
The same!

1028
01:11:57,917 --> 01:11:59,975
This means... he's still alive!

1029
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:03,315
Okay, sir!

1030
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:05,725
A person without any photographs...

1031
01:12:05,805 --> 01:12:07,805
numerous IDs, of which all are fake.

1032
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:10,766
How do we trace him in a
country of 1.1 billion people?

1033
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:12,542
If he's still in the country, that is!

1034
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:14,067
What about the child?

1035
01:12:14,458 --> 01:12:17,183
Should I just forget about him
like it's a bad dream?

1036
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:18,625
What happened?
Eat up.

1037
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:20,612
Auntie, I can't eat so much!

1038
01:12:20,637 --> 01:12:22,558
We're not supposed to eat
like this on duty.

1039
01:12:22,583 --> 01:12:23,872
Just eat!

1040
01:12:23,917 --> 01:12:26,106
It's so late.
Won't your wife be angry?

1041
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,528
No, she won't...

1042
01:12:27,583 --> 01:12:29,270
since I'm not married!

1043
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:31,708
What? You're still unmarried?

1044
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:34,167
Your mother must be there?

1045
01:12:34,192 --> 01:12:35,283
Grandma!

1046
01:12:35,542 --> 01:12:37,167
He's a police officer.
Please stop!

1047
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:40,242
So? Don't mothers
of police officers get angry?

1048
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:44,321
Well, your grandma is correct.
My mother is quite hot-tempered!

1049
01:12:44,417 --> 01:12:45,563
See?

1050
01:12:46,167 --> 01:12:47,758
Give him some water.

1051
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:55,500
Remember I had that stuff on my face
back at the station?

1052
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,917
My mother told me to.

1053
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:01,487
Mother is looking to get me married.

1054
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:06,268
And nowadays, girls want fair husbands.

1055
01:13:15,609 --> 01:13:18,177
Kheya used to do a lovely facial.

1056
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,451
She did a facial for me too.

1057
01:13:21,476 --> 01:13:24,029
She gave me a face pack,
which I've never used. Wait!

1058
01:13:25,043 --> 01:13:27,210
A-C-X-A...

1059
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:29,000
Acxa.

1060
01:13:29,208 --> 01:13:30,583
A Kerala-based brand.

1061
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:35,417
I don't know if it'll help.
Still, if you can glean any clue from it...

1062
01:13:35,792 --> 01:13:38,167
This language is as good as Hebrew to me.

1063
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:40,788
Give me two days.

1064
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,833
I'll try and figure this out.

1065
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:44,684
I'm keeping this.

1066
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:57,264
What do you think?
Will that officer be able to help?

1067
01:13:57,375 --> 01:14:01,125
What you are trying to chase
is not going to be easily caught.

1068
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:02,983
What am I to do, Grandma?

1069
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:08,667
You haven't let me do anything
I wanted to since I was little.

1070
01:14:08,792 --> 01:14:10,417
You didn't even let me go out and play.

1071
01:14:11,625 --> 01:14:15,132
What have you got against me
trying to save an innocent life?

1072
01:14:15,542 --> 01:14:18,125
We were all beside you
in your struggle.

1073
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:21,708
What's the point of going
back to this after five long years?

1074
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,708
Besides, this is a huge racket.

1075
01:14:26,042 --> 01:14:27,417
They said it on the news.

1076
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:29,932
These are dangerous people.

1077
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:34,417
Your mother left me...

1078
01:14:34,825 --> 01:14:36,289
of her own free will.

1079
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:38,860
Now what if something happens to you?

1080
01:14:40,167 --> 01:14:42,250
You're only thinking about yourself.

1081
01:14:42,792 --> 01:14:44,485
Have you thought about how I feel?

1082
01:14:46,542 --> 01:14:48,375
Even Mom didn't think about me.

1083
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,250
She left me too.

1084
01:14:51,542 --> 01:14:53,167
But I won't do that.

1085
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,235
I know...

1086
01:14:59,827 --> 01:15:02,035
I know that my little one is out there.

1087
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:05,774
And I will find him.

1088
01:16:30,566 --> 01:16:32,166
(indistinct chatter)

1089
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,250
Yes, I'm here. Which floor?

1090
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:39,375
Okay.

1091
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:42,309
I heard a rustling noise.

1092
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,864
At first, I thought it was probably a cat.

1093
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:47,917
I went towards the kitchen.

1094
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:51,167
when I was crossing my sister's room,
I had a feeling that...

1095
01:16:51,542 --> 01:16:53,625
that a man was standing there.

1096
01:16:53,958 --> 01:16:56,997
I ran up behind him and grabbed him
but before I could shout for help...

1097
01:16:57,518 --> 01:16:59,208
he covered my mouth.

1098
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:01,731
His face was covered.

1099
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:04,625
He was very strong.

1100
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:07,170
Even with both hands,
I couldn't stop him.

1101
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:08,795
Did you notice anything about him?

1102
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:13,500
He wore a chain around his neck.

1103
01:17:13,792 --> 01:17:14,917
It was golden.

1104
01:17:15,917 --> 01:17:16,718
And...

1105
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:18,522
he had a tattoo on his hand.

1106
01:17:18,583 --> 01:17:20,500
-A tattoo?
-Yes. It was...

1107
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:23,214
Right here...
A tattoo of the sun.

1108
01:17:25,542 --> 01:17:26,000
Hello, sir?

1109
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,417
Yes?

1110
01:17:26,417 --> 01:17:27,500
We've caught someone!

1111
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:27,917
Okay.

1112
01:17:27,917 --> 01:17:29,417
He's at the station.
Please come quickly!

1113
01:17:29,417 --> 01:17:30,875
Okay, I'll be right over.

1114
01:17:33,333 --> 01:17:35,125
Someone matching the sketch
you gave us has been caught.

1115
01:17:35,167 --> 01:17:37,263
You'll have to come with me
to identify him.

1116
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,036
Look.

1117
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:46,000
I don't know anything, sir!

1118
01:17:50,125 --> 01:17:52,417
Did Shammo have any tattoos on his hand?

1119
01:17:54,125 --> 01:17:56,000
He could've had it done later, of course.

1120
01:17:56,542 --> 01:17:58,292
Come on. Let's have lunch.

1121
01:17:58,317 --> 01:17:59,712
I'm not hungry.

1122
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:01,767
You haven't eaten since
dinner last night...

1123
01:18:01,792 --> 01:18:03,250
I told you I'm not hungry!

1124
01:18:04,497 --> 01:18:05,914
Alright, fine.

1125
01:18:06,417 --> 01:18:09,697
I'll leave 2 spoonfuls for you
and eat the rest, okay?

1126
01:18:09,776 --> 01:18:12,056
I don't eat so late.
Thank you.

1127
01:18:12,118 --> 01:18:14,267
Just try it! This is tulaipanji rice!

1128
01:18:14,312 --> 01:18:15,854
From my ancestral home.

1129
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:17,700
You won't get this stuff here.

1130
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:19,867
What rice is this, Auntie? Tulaipanji?

1131
01:18:19,892 --> 01:18:20,892
Yes.

1132
01:18:20,917 --> 01:18:22,083
But how did you know?

1133
01:18:22,083 --> 01:18:23,669
I grew up eating this rice!

1134
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:25,895
Where do you live?

1135
01:18:25,958 --> 01:18:27,292
Raigunj.

1136
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,417
Kheya said that she grew up
eating this rice.

1137
01:18:30,417 --> 01:18:32,056
Is this rice available everywhere?

1138
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,439
It could be available
in many places nowadays...

1139
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:39,208
but there is a sense of pride
in saying she grew up eating it.

1140
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:42,708
Only people from Raigunj
would say something like that.

1141
01:18:44,396 --> 01:18:47,583
Sis! Sis! Please take me with you!
Nothing will happen to me!

1142
01:18:47,667 --> 01:18:49,125
Take me with you, please!

1143
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:50,833
Out of the question!

1144
01:18:50,858 --> 01:18:52,683
Look at me! I'm completely fine now!

1145
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:53,996
Mom, tell her!

1146
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:58,083
Swarnaja, please take him along with you.

1147
01:18:58,083 --> 01:18:58,808
Exactly!

1148
01:18:58,833 --> 01:19:00,973
And if he goes with you,
we'll feel at ease here.

1149
01:19:01,292 --> 01:19:03,027
Mom, why don't you tell her?

1150
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:09,350
If he wasn't fine,
the doctors wouldn't have discharged him.

1151
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:10,754
Take him with you.

1152
01:19:10,917 --> 01:19:12,708
And besides,
you'll have a police officer with you.

1153
01:19:13,083 --> 01:19:15,625
Since everyone's insisting,
take him along.

1154
01:19:16,125 --> 01:19:17,504
There won't be any problem.

1155
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:31,574
(song playing)

1156
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:55,583
Is Rabeya Khatoon your daughter?

1157
01:20:57,848 --> 01:20:58,632
Is this her?

1158
01:20:58,657 --> 01:20:59,343
CHILD SMUGGLING RACKET

1159
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:04,776
Let's go in.

1160
01:21:04,924 --> 01:21:06,174
How long was she married?

1161
01:21:06,734 --> 01:21:08,045
Ten years.

1162
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:09,320
Eloped?

1163
01:21:09,614 --> 01:21:10,458
Yes.

1164
01:21:10,483 --> 01:21:12,793
Why did she return after so many years?

1165
01:21:23,922 --> 01:21:25,056
Rabeya!

1166
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:27,895
What happened to Sushil's leg?

1167
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,154
Let's take him inside!

1168
01:21:29,619 --> 01:21:30,724
Easy, take it easy!

1169
01:21:41,128 --> 01:21:44,318
Without a doctor's help,
you can't get the bullet out, Rabeya.

1170
01:21:44,393 --> 01:21:47,470
Should I call Sunil?
He'll come over immediately.

1171
01:21:47,495 --> 01:21:49,042
We can't tell anyone, Mom!

1172
01:21:49,067 --> 01:21:50,645
Get me some more clean, hot water.

1173
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:56,301
Then, three months later, they left.

1174
01:21:57,023 --> 01:21:59,648
Did Shammo's leg heal by that time?

1175
01:21:59,966 --> 01:22:01,841
She's talking about Sushil.

1176
01:22:02,535 --> 01:22:03,736
No.

1177
01:22:04,151 --> 01:22:06,567
The wound was getting worse.

1178
01:22:07,281 --> 01:22:09,507
Why? Didn't he get it treated?

1179
01:22:10,653 --> 01:22:11,819
No.

1180
01:22:12,957 --> 01:22:16,291
Sushil stayed away
from allopathic medicines.

1181
01:22:17,294 --> 01:22:18,586
He used to say...

1182
01:22:18,804 --> 01:22:21,911
that all pharma companies put
dangerous chemicals in their products.

1183
01:22:22,589 --> 01:22:24,672
He used to take some pills...

1184
01:22:24,713 --> 01:22:27,338
Some imported medicine.

1185
01:22:28,234 --> 01:22:30,567
That kind of worked.

1186
01:22:30,785 --> 01:22:32,160
But it didn't fully heal.

1187
01:22:32,252 --> 01:22:33,543
Which room?

1188
01:22:33,995 --> 01:22:34,919
What?

1189
01:22:34,944 --> 01:22:37,153
Which room did your son-in-law occupy?

1190
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:39,733
Inside.

1191
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:04,917
A-C-X-A...

1192
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:06,042
Acxa!

1193
01:23:26,651 --> 01:23:30,359
This looks like the imported medicine.

1194
01:23:30,726 --> 01:23:33,476
They seem to have had a lot of
faith in this ayurvedic company.

1195
01:23:34,078 --> 01:23:34,843
This means...

1196
01:23:34,875 --> 01:23:41,500
They've been using products
from this company for quite a while.

1197
01:23:42,586 --> 01:23:44,919
We need to track
this company's client list.

1198
01:23:45,786 --> 01:23:47,030
We've picked her up.

1199
01:23:48,111 --> 01:23:49,218
Yeah.

1200
01:23:50,981 --> 01:23:52,146
They're putting her in the car.

1201
01:23:52,171 --> 01:23:53,567
Yes, a policewoman's with her.

1202
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:57,465
I'll call before I enter Kolkata.
Keep an eye on your phone.

1203
01:24:09,042 --> 01:24:09,885
Sis!

1204
01:24:11,018 --> 01:24:12,190
Who's firing?

1205
01:24:13,778 --> 01:24:15,549
There! Someone's there!

1206
01:24:47,022 --> 01:24:48,207
Do you want to eat?

1207
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:49,542
Yeah, eggs and toast.

1208
01:24:56,542 --> 01:24:57,827
Here.

1209
01:24:58,292 --> 01:24:59,678
Boiled eggs for me.

1210
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:06,773
Hey!

1211
01:25:06,875 --> 01:25:08,417
You haven't even had your tea.

1212
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:11,218
Do you want to have something else?

1213
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:19,208
How much longer?

1214
01:25:19,208 --> 01:25:20,208
Almost done.

1215
01:25:20,247 --> 01:25:21,247
Oh.

1216
01:25:25,767 --> 01:25:27,058
What happened?

1217
01:25:27,083 --> 01:25:28,872
What else?
Bad road conditions...

1218
01:25:28,965 --> 01:25:30,886
Broken glass littering the place!

1219
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:32,153
Tell me about it!

1220
01:25:36,081 --> 01:25:37,081
Hey!

1221
01:25:37,292 --> 01:25:38,333
What the...

1222
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:39,500
Hey you!

1223
01:25:39,833 --> 01:25:40,943
What the hell?

1224
01:25:41,917 --> 01:25:42,888
Watch it!

1225
01:25:42,925 --> 01:25:44,675
Do they think it's a playground?

1226
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:50,042
Why don't you tell them anything?
This isn't a playground!

1227
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:52,266

01:25:53,542 --> 01:25:55,042
Where are you off to?

1229
01:26:00,917 --> 01:26:02,750
Does she play any sports?

1230
01:26:03,042 --> 01:26:04,336
No, I don't think so...

1231
01:26:11,042 --> 01:26:12,708
Come on! Kick it here! Come on!

1232
01:26:13,167 --> 01:26:14,502
Kick it here!

1233
01:26:14,667 --> 01:26:16,208
Miss! Kick it here!

1234
01:26:16,375 --> 01:26:17,486
Kick it!

1235
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:29,651
I'm so sorry, dear!
I didn't realise...

1236
01:26:29,708 --> 01:26:30,625
Where does it hurt?

1237
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:31,917
Show me.

1238
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:44,917
Alright, now stretch forward slowly.

1239
01:26:44,958 --> 01:26:46,813
That's fine.
See there?

1240
01:26:46,922 --> 01:26:48,382
See how's he doing the Shavasana?

1241
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:50,667
Observe carefully.

1242
01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:53,828
Doesn't it look like
he's stopped breathing?

1243
01:27:46,133 --> 01:27:47,625
Here. Stop here.

1244
01:27:53,333 --> 01:27:54,667
Let me see.

1245
01:27:58,103 --> 01:27:59,103
Hey...

1246
01:28:05,917 --> 01:28:07,750
Hey! Hey!
Get him!

1247
01:28:07,792 --> 01:28:09,140
After him!

1248
01:28:13,083 --> 01:28:14,648
Stop! Hey! Stop!

1249
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:16,070
Get him!

1250
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:24,336
Wait...stop.

1251
01:28:24,422 --> 01:28:26,320
Stop, dude.

1252
01:28:27,281 --> 01:28:28,281
Stop!

1253
01:28:30,465 --> 01:28:32,269
Yes, where are you?

1254
01:28:32,855 --> 01:28:33,583
The rail line?

1255
01:28:46,045 --> 01:28:46,921
I'm right there.

1256
01:28:47,916 --> 01:28:49,228
Saw him!

1257
01:28:50,643 --> 01:28:51,650
Hey!

1258
01:28:53,950 --> 01:28:54,954
Wait!

1259
01:28:55,491 --> 01:28:56,553
Stop!

1260
01:29:27,475 --> 01:29:29,166
Stay right there! Don't move!

1261
01:29:29,308 --> 01:29:31,002
If I go there, there'll be trouble!

1262
01:29:31,975 --> 01:29:33,245
You lot! Get him!

1263
01:29:33,350 --> 01:29:34,432
Get him!

1264
01:29:35,642 --> 01:29:36,941
Grab the rascal!

1265
01:29:37,308 --> 01:29:38,402
Got you!

1266
01:30:01,909 --> 01:30:03,951
There he is.
Ready to leave.

1267
01:30:04,693 --> 01:30:06,610
This is Mr. and Mrs. Choudhury.

1268
01:30:06,933 --> 01:30:08,141
Say hello.

1269
01:30:08,350 --> 01:30:09,492
Hello, Parag.

1270
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:11,102
What were you doing?

1271
01:30:11,142 --> 01:30:12,484
Playing?

1272
01:30:18,850 --> 01:30:20,062
Come.

1273
01:30:20,392 --> 01:30:21,648
Come here.

1274
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:26,437
Do you like to play?

1275
01:30:27,219 --> 01:30:28,578
-Huh?
-Hmm.

1276
01:30:28,683 --> 01:30:29,808
Do you play video games?

1277
01:30:31,892 --> 01:30:33,048
Car racing?

1278
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:34,475
Or football?

1279
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:36,680
Have you played FIFA?

1280
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:38,267
FIFA?

1281
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:39,687
You'll have a team...

1282
01:30:39,975 --> 01:30:41,366
I'll have a team...

1283
01:30:42,142 --> 01:30:44,882
You can choose your own players...

1284
01:30:45,142 --> 01:30:47,892
and I can choose my own players.

1285
01:30:48,517 --> 01:30:51,350
Then I'll run past the mid-field...

1286
01:30:52,308 --> 01:30:54,642
slip in through the right wing...

1287
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:57,183
dodge the other players...

1288
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:58,430
and then...

1289
01:30:58,517 --> 01:30:59,767
Goal!

1290
01:31:02,183 --> 01:31:02,767
Up!

1291
01:31:02,808 --> 01:31:04,711
Sir! Don't hit me, Sir!

1292
01:31:04,808 --> 01:31:06,600
-Believe me! I don't know anything!
-Up! Get up!

1293
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:09,043
You're not listening
to a word I'm saying.

1294
01:31:09,933 --> 01:31:11,475
Get up! Straight up!

1295
01:31:14,230 --> 01:31:15,575
Come on! Get up!

1296
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,517
Tell me! Tell me what you know!

1297
01:31:18,622 --> 01:31:21,224
-Sir! Please!
-What is it? What did you say?

1298
01:31:22,448 --> 01:31:23,534
Up!

1299
01:31:26,143 --> 01:31:27,338
Start talking, a**hole!

1300
01:31:29,135 --> 01:31:30,475
Sir! Listen to me! Please!

1301
01:31:30,475 --> 01:31:32,596
What did you say? I can't hear you!

1302
01:31:33,267 --> 01:31:34,557
What?

1303
01:31:34,683 --> 01:31:35,838
Talk!

1304
01:31:36,267 --> 01:31:37,862
Talk!
Let's hear it!

1305
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:39,927
-I'm telling you! I don't know anything!
-Talk!

1306
01:31:41,392 --> 01:31:42,956
Talk!

1307
01:31:43,058 --> 01:31:44,850
I'll tell you, sir! I'll tell you!

1308
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:47,081
I'll talk! I'll talk!

1309
01:31:47,604 --> 01:31:49,343
How did you meet Sushil?

1310
01:31:49,431 --> 01:31:51,046
I...

1311
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:52,960
didn't know anyone before...

1312
01:31:54,251 --> 01:31:56,734
Sushil, Shammo, I had no...

1313
01:31:57,657 --> 01:31:58,642
Lies again?

1314
01:31:58,683 --> 01:32:00,392
I'm telling you the truth, sir!

1315
01:32:01,373 --> 01:32:03,498
I didn't know anyone!

1316
01:32:03,649 --> 01:32:04,774
He... he...

1317
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,454
He just told me to...

1318
01:32:06,876 --> 01:32:09,774
show him to ma'am when she came.

1319
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:11,680
Who gave you these instructions?

1320
01:32:13,337 --> 01:32:15,347
Who gave you these instructions??

1321
01:32:15,809 --> 01:32:17,726
Dr. Burman...

1322
01:32:18,386 --> 01:32:21,428
I used to work with Dr. Burman.

1323
01:32:22,475 --> 01:32:25,475
It's about time you started working out.

1324
01:32:25,475 --> 01:32:27,433
Doctor, tell her what to do.

1325
01:32:28,308 --> 01:32:30,947
Don't worry about it.
I'll arrange everything.

1326
01:32:31,594 --> 01:32:33,362
All you have to do is send her there.

1327
01:32:33,799 --> 01:32:34,996
Dr. Burman sent me.

1328
01:32:35,021 --> 01:32:36,675
Oh, right!

1329
01:32:36,949 --> 01:32:38,824
Do you have any blood-related problems?

1330
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:44,270
Take care of yourself now.

1331
01:32:44,427 --> 01:32:45,810
Don't get too attached...

1332
01:32:46,395 --> 01:32:47,817
to the kid.

1333
01:32:48,397 --> 01:32:51,581
Sir, we found these at his place.

1334
01:33:40,315 --> 01:33:44,774
Doctor Uncle sold
my most personal emotions.

1335
01:33:47,178 --> 01:33:49,470
Kheya's suicide attempt was staged.

1336
01:33:49,517 --> 01:33:51,090
I went to their house...

1337
01:33:51,115 --> 01:33:53,632
saw the hand-knitted sweater...

1338
01:33:54,225 --> 01:33:56,529
became emotional and agreed to it.

1339
01:33:57,475 --> 01:33:59,183
A masterful plan.

1340
01:33:59,943 --> 01:34:01,693
They've done this sort of thing before.

1341
01:34:01,769 --> 01:34:04,603
Why did they suddenly target Swarnaja?

1342
01:34:04,721 --> 01:34:06,894
They needed a child.

1343
01:34:07,287 --> 01:34:10,829
But the child had to match
her blood group.

1344
01:34:10,854 --> 01:34:13,729
But Doctor Uncle told me
our blood groups don't match!

1345
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:16,634
That was also a lie, ma'am.

1346
01:34:16,949 --> 01:34:19,116
Who told you to introduce
Shammo to ma'am?

1347
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:21,471
Dr. Burman?

1348
01:34:21,496 --> 01:34:23,262
No, sir.

1349
01:34:23,298 --> 01:34:25,333
The doctor and I...

1350
01:34:25,761 --> 01:34:29,011
sold Swarnaja's blood samples abroad.

1351
01:34:31,089 --> 01:34:34,717
This was our only crime.

1352
01:34:35,517 --> 01:34:37,142
But one day...

1353
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:42,306
a foreign agent
who deals with this operation...

1354
01:34:42,392 --> 01:34:46,392
saw her blood report and
wanted to meet the doctor.

1355
01:34:46,573 --> 01:34:48,765
They just told us...

1356
01:34:49,251 --> 01:34:52,542
that a Bengali couple
would come to Kolkata.

1357
01:34:52,643 --> 01:34:55,915
And that we had to make sure
ma'am meets them.

1358
01:34:56,943 --> 01:34:58,985
The Doctor didn't agree at first.

1359
01:34:59,657 --> 01:35:04,098
But they threatened to kill him.

1360
01:35:04,545 --> 01:35:07,878
They said they'd expose
his secret blood trading business.

1361
01:35:08,716 --> 01:35:10,729
So he finally agreed.

1362
01:35:10,951 --> 01:35:13,167
But he clearly stated that...

1363
01:35:13,192 --> 01:35:17,292
he'd call it off if she was harmed.

1364
01:35:17,464 --> 01:35:18,712
Any harm...

1365
01:35:18,892 --> 01:35:20,933
But what happened to the child?

1366
01:35:21,267 --> 01:35:23,642
Even I don't know that, sir.

1367
01:35:23,766 --> 01:35:28,456
That morning
Kheya and Shammo were to leave...

1368
01:35:28,481 --> 01:35:31,315
Swarnaja's house with the child.

1369
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:35,781
They were to hand him over
to the doctor the same day.

1370
01:35:36,233 --> 01:35:39,941
Those were the instructions.

1371
01:35:40,142 --> 01:35:42,975
I was supposed to go with him as well.

1372
01:35:43,829 --> 01:35:44,912
But...

1373
01:35:46,712 --> 01:35:50,513
Sir suddenly told me not to come.

1374
01:35:51,011 --> 01:35:53,935
Soon after that, I found out that...

1375
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:56,466
he's been murdered.

1376
01:35:57,423 --> 01:36:00,507
Is it possible that Shammo
has already sold the child?

1377
01:36:00,986 --> 01:36:02,390
That Shammo committed the murder?

1378
01:36:02,415 --> 01:36:05,248
-No, sir.
-To frame Dr. Burman?

1379
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,932
No, sir.
It's not possible because...

1380
01:36:08,036 --> 01:36:10,987
Because Shammo
is still looking for the child.

1381
01:36:11,012 --> 01:36:15,787
It was on Shammo's instructions
that I went to attack ma'am...

1382
01:36:17,259 --> 01:36:20,800
The people who run this business
from abroad...

1383
01:36:20,846 --> 01:36:23,846
are putting immense pressure
on Shammo.

1384
01:36:23,940 --> 01:36:26,665
They even shot him in the leg once.

1385
01:36:26,930 --> 01:36:31,805
If he can't find the child,
Shammo's dead.

1386
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:34,501
All I know is...

1387
01:36:34,602 --> 01:36:37,560
the child is worth a lot
in the international market.

1388
01:36:37,878 --> 01:36:39,253
There are...

1389
01:36:39,966 --> 01:36:45,419
many big companies
wanting to experiment with the child.

1390
01:36:45,506 --> 01:36:48,641
And they've already placed
large bids on him.

1391
01:36:50,394 --> 01:36:53,649
That's all I know, sir.
I swear!

1392
01:37:08,151 --> 01:37:09,276
Be careful.

1393
01:37:16,669 --> 01:37:17,771
Bye!

1394
01:37:19,219 --> 01:37:21,510
Best of luck, Mr. Choudhury.

1395
01:37:22,767 --> 01:37:26,267
Parag doesn't only have golden blood...

1396
01:37:26,662 --> 01:37:28,576
he has a golden heart too.

1397
01:37:29,326 --> 01:37:30,618
Do take care of him.

1398
01:37:30,696 --> 01:37:32,123
-Sure, I will.
-Okay.

1399
01:37:32,162 --> 01:37:34,995
Take care of yourself.
Be a good boy.

1400
01:37:35,112 --> 01:37:36,237
Bye!

1401
01:38:10,487 --> 01:38:11,534
Sis!

1402
01:38:11,933 --> 01:38:13,424
Hey, don't cry!

1403
01:38:15,959 --> 01:38:18,584
When you get the little one,
keep him with you.

1404
01:38:18,971 --> 01:38:20,763
The child is yours alone.

1405
01:38:22,792 --> 01:38:24,432
His blood is yours.

1406
01:38:24,764 --> 01:38:27,597
Nothing's happened to him.
You'll find him. I know it!

1407
01:38:28,334 --> 01:38:30,014
And maybe he's...

1408
01:38:30,337 --> 01:38:32,186
waiting for you to find him.

1409
01:38:32,359 --> 01:38:35,526
Since your blood is the same,
you must be able to feel his suffering?

1410
01:38:36,206 --> 01:38:38,278
No one but you can ever understand him.

1411
01:38:38,358 --> 01:38:42,169
We're taking him to the police headquarters
but I don't think he knows anything more.

1412
01:38:42,194 --> 01:38:43,944
This is an international racket.

1413
01:38:44,131 --> 01:38:46,147
We don't know who's working
undercover for them.

1414
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:48,180
We don't know who has the child now...

1415
01:38:48,214 --> 01:38:49,811
if they at all have him.

1416
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:51,079
Too many questions.

1417
01:38:51,104 --> 01:38:52,701
And what if they don't have him yet?

1418
01:38:53,329 --> 01:38:54,663
What if he's still alive?

1419
01:38:54,688 --> 01:38:56,438
How will we trace him?

1420
01:38:56,643 --> 01:38:58,842
-With blood.
-What?

1421
01:38:58,905 --> 01:39:02,797
If we share the same blood,
and if he's still alive...

1422
01:39:03,115 --> 01:39:06,784
his name will have been registered
at the blood bank.

1423
01:39:06,809 --> 01:39:08,027
Let's go.

1424
01:39:09,664 --> 01:39:13,001
Do you have
Rh Null blood groups there?

1425
01:39:13,699 --> 01:39:16,533
Yes! A child. Around 4 years old.

1426
01:39:17,248 --> 01:39:18,548
Where does he live?

1427
01:39:18,654 --> 01:39:20,009
Give me the address.

1428
01:39:21,032 --> 01:39:22,196
An orphanage?

1429
01:39:22,225 --> 01:39:23,475
-Sir?
-Okay.

1430
01:39:24,123 --> 01:39:25,456
Here's the address.

1431
01:39:32,214 --> 01:39:33,464
We've found him.

1432
01:39:51,133 --> 01:39:52,960
They want to adopt Parag...

1433
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:55,013
for his blood group?

1434
01:39:55,779 --> 01:39:56,892
Strange!

1435
01:39:56,917 --> 01:39:59,292
It was for his blood group
that no one wanted to adopt him.

1436
01:39:59,322 --> 01:40:01,874
The answer is in your own question.

1437
01:40:02,103 --> 01:40:04,728
They wanted to adopt him
because his blood group is rare.

1438
01:40:04,767 --> 01:40:07,468
Please cooperate with us
and give us the relevant details.

1439
01:40:07,493 --> 01:40:10,326
You have no idea what a big crime
is about to be committed!

1440
01:40:10,721 --> 01:40:13,836
Show me some legal papers
and I'll certainly give you the details.

1441
01:40:13,915 --> 01:40:17,456
This adoption case has the minister's
recommendation, so I'm sorry.

1442
01:40:17,511 --> 01:40:20,345
Can you at least tell us
whether the father...

1443
01:40:20,678 --> 01:40:22,359
had a problem with his leg?

1444
01:40:26,681 --> 01:40:27,764
Yes...

1445
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:29,772
He was in a wheelchair.

1446
01:40:30,477 --> 01:40:32,079
He recently had an opeartion
in his leg.

1447
01:40:33,581 --> 01:40:35,790
If you already know him...

1448
01:40:35,964 --> 01:40:37,769
why are you asking me for details?

1449
01:40:38,962 --> 01:40:39,826
Yes?

1450
01:40:40,157 --> 01:40:43,323
Sir, the bottle you gave me is from
a Kerala-based ayurvedic company.

1451
01:40:43,433 --> 01:40:45,528
It is a medication for gangrene prevention.

1452
01:40:45,553 --> 01:40:46,308
Okay.

1453
01:40:46,350 --> 01:40:50,517
No side-effects.
And each bottle contains 60 pills.

1454
01:40:50,584 --> 01:40:51,309
Sixty?

1455
01:40:51,763 --> 01:40:55,138
In the last three months,
they've sent eight such parcels to Bengal.

1456
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:56,145
Eight?

1457
01:40:56,170 --> 01:40:57,201
Yes, sir.

1458
01:40:57,226 --> 01:40:58,490
One in North Bengal.

1459
01:40:58,688 --> 01:41:00,813
One in Burdhwan
and six in Kolkata.

1460
01:41:00,854 --> 01:41:01,553
I see.

1461
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:03,310
The six that came to Kolkata...

1462
01:41:03,342 --> 01:41:06,014
came in two different shipments
from two different phone numbers.

1463
01:41:06,039 --> 01:41:06,803
Go on.

1464
01:41:06,828 --> 01:41:09,869
And both shipments
went to the same shop.

1465
01:41:09,972 --> 01:41:10,889
Which shop?

1466
01:41:10,914 --> 01:41:11,687
A small grocery shop.

1467
01:41:12,024 --> 01:41:14,315
Quickly locate that shop.

1468
01:41:14,363 --> 01:41:15,238
Send a force there.

1469
01:41:15,263 --> 01:41:17,013
And you go with them!

1470
01:41:17,058 --> 01:41:17,952
Okay!

1471
01:41:18,889 --> 01:41:22,372
Sir, I'll meet you at the airport.

1472
01:41:22,372 --> 01:41:23,372
Okay.

1473
01:41:23,797 --> 01:41:24,963
Bye, Parag.

1474
01:41:31,951 --> 01:41:34,493
So, Parag?

1475
01:41:34,545 --> 01:41:35,545
Hmm?

1476
01:41:35,577 --> 01:41:36,654
Hey.

1477
01:41:38,105 --> 01:41:40,189
There's a surprise for you.

1478
01:41:40,355 --> 01:41:41,537
What is it?

1479
01:41:41,562 --> 01:41:44,412
We're going abroad
to buy you video games.

1480
01:41:45,186 --> 01:41:47,912
Have you ever been on a plane before?

1481
01:41:47,937 --> 01:41:48,735
No.

1482
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:50,351
We're going by plane.

1483
01:41:50,419 --> 01:41:52,225
-Where is Aparna Choudhury?
-I don't know, sir.

1484
01:41:52,225 --> 01:41:53,959
-You don't know?
-No, sir.

1485
01:41:53,984 --> 01:41:57,304
-The junior artists who to this studio...
-Yes?

1486
01:41:57,329 --> 01:41:58,787
Their props are delivered here,
and I keep them.

1487
01:41:58,825 --> 01:42:00,742
And you don't know
what gets delivered to you?

1488
01:42:00,767 --> 01:42:02,493
How am I to know?
What have I been saying?

1489
01:42:02,518 --> 01:42:04,016
No point getting angry.
I really don't know!

1490
01:42:04,041 --> 01:42:05,494
-Where is she?
-I don't know!

1491
01:42:05,519 --> 01:42:07,009
-Take him in!
-Let me go!

1492
01:42:07,034 --> 01:42:08,955
(indistinct yelling)

1493
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,469
There! There's Aparna!
There she is!

1494
01:42:12,675 --> 01:42:13,759
Out of my way!

1495
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:18,749
Do you see that man?

1496
01:42:19,232 --> 01:42:21,232
He's going to take
a nice photo of you, okay?

1497
01:42:21,595 --> 01:42:23,695
Sit still for him, alright?

1498
01:42:24,643 --> 01:42:26,273
Smile please?

1499
01:42:51,482 --> 01:42:52,676
Look here!

1500
01:42:53,751 --> 01:42:55,334
Let's take a nice photo of you.

1501
01:42:56,399 --> 01:42:57,345
Can I?

1502
01:42:57,370 --> 01:42:58,321
No?

1503
01:42:58,909 --> 01:43:00,909
Come on!
Just one photo.

1504
01:43:01,751 --> 01:43:03,834
Don't shake your head.
Hold still.

1505
01:43:22,056 --> 01:43:23,253
Does it hurt?

1506
01:43:25,485 --> 01:43:27,235
Tell me, can I tighten it a bit more?

1507
01:43:27,584 --> 01:43:28,898
Is it hurting?

1508
01:43:30,971 --> 01:43:32,124
That's enough.

1509
01:43:51,681 --> 01:43:52,873
S**t!

1510
01:43:53,682 --> 01:43:55,293
Hey, start packing!

1511
01:43:55,431 --> 01:43:56,368
What happened?

1512
01:43:56,408 --> 01:43:59,197
Aparna has been caught!
The police will be here any minute!

1513
01:43:59,269 --> 01:44:01,811
This laptop, these papers...
Pack everything.

1514
01:44:02,532 --> 01:44:03,912
And don't forget my pills.

1515
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:14,222
S**t!

1516
01:44:14,821 --> 01:44:15,956
I'll get the kid!

1517
01:44:17,863 --> 01:44:19,352
You guys go that side.
Quickly!

1518
01:44:19,392 --> 01:44:20,433
I'll go around the back.

1519
01:44:20,433 --> 01:44:22,306
-You! Come with me!
-Yes, sir.

1520
01:44:31,359 --> 01:44:32,500
Come on!

1521
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:34,297
Where are you taking me?

1522
01:44:47,174 --> 01:44:49,471
Where are you taking me?
Let me go.

1523
01:44:49,776 --> 01:44:50,947
Putt me down!

1524
01:45:01,001 --> 01:45:04,090
Where are we going?
Let go of me!

1525
01:45:33,665 --> 01:45:34,642
Babai?

1526
01:45:52,938 --> 01:45:54,738
Shammo! Let him go!

1527
01:45:54,763 --> 01:45:56,355
Where are you taking him?
Shammo!

1528
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:59,369
Let him go!
Let! Him! Go!

1529
01:45:59,446 --> 01:46:00,904
Let him go, Shammo!

1530
01:46:00,954 --> 01:46:03,431
-Shammo! Let him go!
-Let him go!

1531
01:46:04,283 --> 01:46:05,572
Let go of me.

1532
01:46:06,063 --> 01:46:07,746
Get him! Get him!

1533
01:46:07,903 --> 01:46:09,503
(indistinct chatter)

1534
01:46:12,232 --> 01:46:13,315
Jump.

1535
01:46:13,349 --> 01:46:14,410
Go on. Jump.

1536
01:46:18,148 --> 01:46:19,428
F**k! Catch him!

1537
01:47:22,092 --> 01:47:28,209
Let's not talk
For the sake of talking

1538
01:47:31,475 --> 01:47:37,225
Let's not talk
For the sake of talking

1539
01:47:40,747 --> 01:47:45,365
The weight of words is far too great

1540
01:47:45,513 --> 01:47:50,009
The weight of words is far too great

1541
01:47:50,087 --> 01:47:54,152
The weight of words
Brings tears to the eye

1542
01:47:54,707 --> 01:48:00,284
Let's not talk
For the sake of talking

1543
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:09,292
Let's not talk
For the sake of talking

1544
01:48:15,668 --> 01:48:19,683
It's not easy to heal the heart

1545
01:48:20,355 --> 01:48:25,086
You might lose more than that

1546
01:48:25,157 --> 01:48:29,101
I am full of hurt

1547
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:34,408
And my life is in shambles

1548
01:48:34,472 --> 01:48:38,792
Yet there might be
Something to look forward to

1549
01:48:39,026 --> 01:48:44,517
Let's not talk about all that

1550
01:48:48,361 --> 01:48:54,682
Let's not talk
For the sake of talking

1551
01:49:18,742 --> 01:49:22,082
There is silence after words

1552
01:49:22,742 --> 01:49:27,075
Like glass before it hits the ground

1553
01:49:27,992 --> 01:49:36,492
I've held back tears
Just to listen to your words

1554
01:49:37,367 --> 01:49:45,694
As I opened my mouth to speak

1555
01:49:46,712 --> 01:49:55,004
Someone in my mind
Pulled at my heart strings

1556
01:49:55,450 --> 01:49:59,796
Listen well

1557
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:06,470
We are but the bearer of words

1558
01:50:07,783 --> 01:50:13,533
Let's talk a bit less now

1559
01:50:17,117 --> 01:50:22,867
Let's not talk
For the sake of talking

1560
01:50:26,456 --> 01:50:31,081
The weight of words is far too great

1561
01:50:31,195 --> 01:50:35,711
The weight of words is far too great

1562
01:50:35,822 --> 01:50:40,456
The weight of words
Brings tears to the eye

1563
01:50:40,567 --> 01:50:44,979
Let's not talk
For the sake of talking

1564
01:50:45,085 --> 01:50:49,696
Let's not talk about what didn't happen

1565
01:50:49,790 --> 01:50:57,328
Let's talk a bit less now

1566
01:51:00,886 --> 01:51:01,891
Sis!

1567
01:51:01,982 --> 01:51:03,682
The child is yours alone.

1568
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:05,526
His blood is yours.

1569
01:51:05,675 --> 01:51:08,175
Nothing's happened to him.
You'll find him. I know it!

1570
01:51:08,384 --> 01:51:11,550
Since your blood is the same,
you must be able to feel his suffering?

1571
01:51:12,193 --> 01:51:13,938
No one but you can ever understand him.

1572
01:51:26,665 --> 01:51:27,837
Shonai?

1573
01:51:28,529 --> 01:51:29,987
Have some food at least?

1574
01:52:21,339 --> 01:52:23,629
Oh, Grandma!

1575
01:52:55,573 --> 01:52:57,652
I want to show you something.

1576
01:52:59,865 --> 01:53:01,657
I had kept this with me.

1577
01:53:02,579 --> 01:53:06,329
The man who came to me
with Parag was a doctor.

1578
01:53:07,006 --> 01:53:10,173
Parag was hardly
two and a half months old then.

1579
01:53:10,839 --> 01:53:12,257
He was wearing this then.

1580
01:53:12,616 --> 01:53:17,058
Ma'am, some doctor wants to meet you.

1581
01:53:18,019 --> 01:53:19,769
Please keep this child.
He's in grave danger!

1582
01:53:19,794 --> 01:53:20,496
Doctor?

1583
01:53:20,873 --> 01:53:24,915
The doctor told me
to take special care of Parag.

1584
01:53:25,165 --> 01:53:26,791
And he also said...

1585
01:53:26,962 --> 01:53:30,628
Keep him! I'll come and get him!
Tonight he's in grave danger!

1586
01:53:30,653 --> 01:53:35,565
Keep him! Just remember one thing.
He has the rarest blood group.

1587
01:53:35,612 --> 01:53:37,196
Don't let anyone know about it.

1588
01:53:37,267 --> 01:53:38,392
-I'll come and get him!
-But doctor--

1589
01:53:38,392 --> 01:53:40,165
Don't worry! I'll be back!

1590
01:53:40,534 --> 01:53:41,785
He never came back.

1591
01:53:42,143 --> 01:53:44,063
And four years have passed since then.

1592
01:53:44,334 --> 01:53:46,333
Why did you inform the blood bank?

1593
01:53:46,678 --> 01:53:48,135
What happened was...

1594
01:53:48,451 --> 01:53:51,010
Parag fell down while playing
on the swings.

1595
01:53:51,076 --> 01:53:54,541
He had scratches all over.
I started worrying.

1596
01:53:54,649 --> 01:53:56,430
What if something worse happened?

1597
01:53:56,811 --> 01:53:58,722
That's why I couldn't keep
my promise to the doctor.

1598
01:54:01,209 --> 01:54:03,001
But I later realised something.

1599
01:54:03,899 --> 01:54:06,165
As soon as the information
reached the blood bank...

1600
01:54:06,664 --> 01:54:09,571
the racketeers picked up on it.

1601
01:54:10,721 --> 01:54:11,846
And soon after...

1602
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:16,517
they became Mr. and Mrs. Choudhury
and came to adopt Parag.

1603
01:54:17,573 --> 01:54:20,240
But there's something I don't get.

1604
01:54:20,808 --> 01:54:22,308
Who is this doctor?

1605
01:54:22,743 --> 01:54:24,589
And why does he want to save Parag?

1606
01:54:26,409 --> 01:54:28,798
Dr. Burman was our family physician.

1607
01:54:28,912 --> 01:54:30,146
Ma'am?

1608
01:54:30,230 --> 01:54:31,514
What is it?

1609
01:54:31,714 --> 01:54:33,646
Parag doesn't want to come down.

1610
01:54:33,671 --> 01:54:36,318
What? Tell him that
I'm calling him here.

1611
01:54:36,399 --> 01:54:38,100
-Yes, ma'am.
-Ask him to come down.

1612
01:54:38,142 --> 01:54:39,181
Just a second...

1613
01:54:39,206 --> 01:54:40,747
Doesn't he want to go with me?

1614
01:54:40,884 --> 01:54:43,165
-Does he know that I've come to get him?
-No, no.

1615
01:54:43,190 --> 01:54:44,774
I think he's a little scared.

1616
01:54:44,829 --> 01:54:46,995
I'm ready to complete responsibility
for him, of course.

1617
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:49,304
But I also don't want to
force him to come with me.

1618
01:54:49,401 --> 01:54:50,600
Alright.

1619
01:54:51,467 --> 01:54:54,913
Why don't you
try and talk to him yourself?

1620
01:54:55,217 --> 01:54:56,266
Parag!

1621
01:54:57,761 --> 01:54:58,883
Parag?

1622
01:55:00,852 --> 01:55:01,892
Parag?

1623
01:55:03,959 --> 01:55:04,999
Wait!

1624
01:55:06,056 --> 01:55:07,847
Someone's come to meet you.

1625
01:55:08,076 --> 01:55:09,593
She's waiting downstairs.

1626
01:55:09,639 --> 01:55:10,771
Let's go meet her.

1627
01:55:13,006 --> 01:55:14,099
Parag?

1628
01:55:15,675 --> 01:55:17,099
Look who's come.

1629
01:55:18,337 --> 01:55:19,670
Can you recognise her?

1630
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:23,859
Remember she went to hospital to see you?

1631
01:55:23,917 --> 01:55:25,792
She donated her blood to you.

1632
01:55:26,073 --> 01:55:27,204
Remember?

1633
01:55:29,557 --> 01:55:31,368
What are you doing here, Parag?

1634
01:55:31,393 --> 01:55:32,681
Won't you go out and play?

1635
01:55:34,508 --> 01:55:36,937
I can take you out to play.
Do you want to come?

1636
01:55:38,948 --> 01:55:42,413
And if you don't feel like playing, then...

1637
01:55:43,065 --> 01:55:46,690
do what your heart desires.
Whatever you want!

1638
01:55:52,623 --> 01:55:53,724
Parag!

1639
01:55:54,350 --> 01:55:55,568
What are you doing?

1640
01:55:55,892 --> 01:55:57,037
He's just a kid!

1641
01:57:02,965 --> 01:57:04,767
Are you leaving?

1642
01:57:09,292 --> 01:57:10,745
Are you talking to me, Parag?

1643
01:57:10,770 --> 01:57:14,354
If I go with you,
can I really do whatever I want?

1644
01:57:14,759 --> 01:57:15,909
Yes, Parag.

1645
01:57:16,006 --> 01:57:17,034
Really.

1646
01:57:17,225 --> 01:57:19,642
Can I write a letter to God?

1647
01:57:27,057 --> 01:57:28,486
Can I go out and play?

1648
01:57:31,204 --> 01:57:32,909
You won't stop me?

1649
01:57:33,805 --> 01:57:35,388
Why should I stop you?

1650
01:57:35,485 --> 01:57:37,463
What if I get hurt and start bleeding?

1651
01:57:39,685 --> 01:57:41,060
I'm here for you.

1652
01:57:52,885 --> 01:57:54,510
There are no such things as accidents.

1653
01:57:54,822 --> 01:57:57,613
What happens
happens for the best.

1654
01:57:57,806 --> 01:58:00,139
My elder used to say
that accidents do happen...

1655
01:58:00,375 --> 01:58:02,698
but not always for the worse.

1656
01:58:03,376 --> 01:58:12,019
What more can I ask for?

1657
01:58:13,556 --> 01:58:18,284
The light shines bright
Even in darkness

1658
01:58:19,087 --> 01:58:24,253
Like a swarm of fireflies
Flying in a blaze

1659
01:58:24,643 --> 01:58:29,377
The eyes burned bright with the light

1660
01:58:32,951 --> 01:58:34,146
(song playing)
