1
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:22,992
Did you ever think, why
we love the rains?

2
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:28,003
Why we just start humming
a tune for no reason

3
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:32,940
Why the waves on our feet
make us feel free

4
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:38,345
Why our restless feet take
us to new destinations

5
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:43,682
these are signs, that tell us

6
00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:48,448
All that we need, is love

7
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:51,078
why someone can make your
heart skip a beat

8
00:02:51,755 --> 00:03:01,130
Why the scent of someone,
lingers on in your breath

9
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:07,095
Why do lips quiver, unable to say

10
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:11,673
That her hesitation, is her
expressing her need for love

11
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:14,301
Did you ever think

12
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:21,707
Did you ever think, why
we love the rains?

13
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:27,155
Why we just start humming
a tune for no reason

14
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:32,456
these are signs, that tell us

15
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:37,228
All that we need, is love

16
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:26,168
The judgement for the Delhi Wallia
accident case will be passed today

17
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,176
This case has created a lot of
controversy amongst the media..

18
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,836
..we`ll have to wait and see

19
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,177
Five to three for 15 years,
six to four for life sentence

20
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,308
..six to two for death penalty,
ten to one for release

21
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,186
Judge Jaswant Rai will
shortly deliver

22
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,348
his verdict in the
Wallia accident case

23
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,757
Soon we will know whether Ranbir
Talwar is let off or sentenced

24
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,419
Many are keen to see him jailed

25
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,190
Why is it that in our
country no politician

26
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,929
or industrialist has ever
been convicted of a crime

27
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:00,467
Will another celebrity
go scot-free today ?

28
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:03,505
Stay tuned for the
latest developments

29
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,313
l had warned you to sell off the
stock, it`ll go down even more

30
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,222
lncase the judgement
is against you..

31
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,422
..what will happen to your
Los Angeles project?

32
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:22,556
Sorry.. Sorry

33
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,224
Ranbeer, has the board of directors

34
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,599
of your company appointed
a new Chairman ?

35
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,903
Malaika, will you..?

36
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,812
After one year nothing has
changed for Ranbeer Talwar

37
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:44,749
lnstead of BMW, he drives
around in a Mercedes

38
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:48,415
Will today`s court judgment alter
the course of his life ?

39
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:52,252
With cameraperson Ravi Panchal,
this is Joita Mitra, Star News

40
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,438
Oh.. my..

41
00:07:15,585 --> 00:07:21,683
Hi Sunita.. absolutely Sunita,
l agree.. Ya ya.. l know - Stop it

42
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:22,849
What are you doing?

43
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:25,827
lt`s Sunita.. Sunita Menon. lt`s
important - Can you hang up?

44
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:27,624
Ya.. Really..
- What are you doing?

45
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:28,855
You are in a court!
- Aa..

46
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:30,559
Ya.. Ok.. Ok

47
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:31,691
Don`t talk in the court!
- Ok ..

48
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:33,736
Ok .. Oh that`s great..

49
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,939
..l`ll talk to you later..
lt`s for you!

50
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:41,573
Let us know what your
astrologer said

51
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:45,372
Ranbeer will be let off !
lsn`t Sunita just great?

52
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:48,713
l do nothing without her advice.
She is just too good

53
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:53,412
Did Sunita also tell you you`ll
be thrown out of the my court

54
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:55,491
.. and your cell phone
will be confiscated ?

55
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,616
That she didn`t

56
00:07:57,327 --> 00:08:03,926
Leave me alone.. don`t touch me
with your dirty hands.. How rude.

57
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,458
l`ll sue you. Baby just bring
my bag it`s a Manish Malhotra

58
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:12,440
lf you permit, can we proceed?

59
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:15,669
Sorry your honour

60
00:08:22,518 --> 00:08:26,420
Today the media plays up all cases

61
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:31,487
and they and the public pass their
verdict even before the courts do

62
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,360
ln all this the real victims
are often forgotten

63
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,365
which in this case are..

64
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:41,096
Mr. and Mrs. Wallia`s now
orphaned children.

65
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,369
Any punishment given
to Ranbeer Talwar

66
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:49,502
will be of no help to
these innocent children

67
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:58,818
To safeguard their interest

68
00:08:59,522 --> 00:09:05,552
this court proposes to deliver
an unprecedented judgment

69
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:08,989
Mr. Ranbeer Talwar,

70
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:13,560
This court orders that from
this day onwards till

71
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,072
the youngest Wallia child
is 18 years of age,

72
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:21,409
these children will
stay in your house

73
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:27,583
You will personally take
complete care of them

74
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:32,412
You shall not send them
to a boarding school,

75
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,616
nor will you go out
of town without them

76
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:39,695
l will check on them
after three months,

77
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:47,160
and if l find any violation, or
that the children are ill-treated

78
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:51,903
or unhappy with you,

79
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:55,704
l shall sentence you to 20 years
imprisonment without bail.

80
00:09:56,913 --> 00:10:00,007
This court appoints you
their legal guardian,

81
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:02,641
and hands them over to you

82
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,146
This court is adjourned for the day

83
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:19,196
Judge Jaswant Rai has delivered
a very controversial decision

84
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,469
lmagine these poor
children will now

85
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,062
have to stay with their
parents` murderer

86
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:30,579
The judgement has been passed

87
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:34,609
Will you be able to take
care of the children?

88
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:38,211
How can l pay up? Who knew that
the judge would do that?

89
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:40,752
This is like a rained out match

90
00:10:40,823 --> 00:10:44,020
After killing two, who would`ve
thought he`d go free?

91
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:46,485
Fortunately there was another
phone in my bag..

92
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,962
..That silly judge.. Anyways
forget all that

93
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,598
Sunita, you were so accurate!

94
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,567
Yes, the kids will
stay with Ranbeer

95
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,904
Read their cards. We don`t
want any problems

96
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,563
Schedule a meeting with the
board.. we`re back on track!

97
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:01,033
Yes, of course Los Angeles is on

98
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,636
Malaika,

99
00:11:03,713 --> 00:11:07,012
One second.. This is all so
exciting! Aren`t you happy?

100
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:08,910
Take my credit card

101
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,886
Buy them the best toys, whatever,

102
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:14,923
Just keep them happy
- OK - You don`t mind, right?

103
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:16,618
To go shopping? Never!!

104
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,086
Don`t you worry baby,
l`ll handle it

105
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:25,029
l`ve never been to the children`s
section of a Mall

106
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,127
What fun it`ll be ! Oh.. sorry..
Sunita.. sorry.. sorry

107
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:31,530
Baby, Sunita says it will be good

108
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:35,703
if the kids come home between
1 1 and 12 tomorrow

109
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:37,203
Sunita you were saying?

110
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:38,805
Where are these kids anyway ?

111
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:45,645
For the past one year, various
relatives come to look after them.

112
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,287
Relatives don`t come,
they run away !

113
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:51,056
l`m Vashisht, l`m nine years old

114
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:53,788
l`m Aditi, l`m seven

115
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:58,193
lqbal, l`m also seven, and this
is my friend, Sher Singh

116
00:11:58,267 --> 00:11:59,666
They aren`t twins!

117
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:02,899
Mum and Dad found lqbal on
the steps of a gurudwara.

118
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,165
More of that later

119
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:08,073
Hi, l`m Avantika. l`m in class 1A

120
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:11,738
My teacher is Miss Minchin.
l`m five years old

121
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:14,883
This is my little
brother Lucha Singh

122
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:19,316
And we don`t want any uncle or
aunt got rid of staying with us

123
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:22,986
First l got rid of Anil uncle..

124
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:36,831
And then, Kiran aunty

125
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,802
Who loved to go cycling

126
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,349
Then came Pushpa aunty.

127
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:54,987
Pushpa aunty, a.k.a Hitler

128
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:59,755
They say Pushpa
aunty trained Hitler

129
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,790
Who`s Hitler?

130
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:08,297
When she wanted to cool off

131
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,798
The cooler gave her some black
ink along with the cold air

132
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:17,039
And coming out of the room,

133
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:19,706
don`t know how she stepped
on my skates

134
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,947
Down the stairs and straight
out of the house she went

135
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:31,291
lf we can`t live with our parents..

136
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:33,388
we don`t want to live
with anyone else

137
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:37,892
We have what we need,
we have each other.

138
00:13:38,935 --> 00:13:42,029
Now they`re sending us
to his house,

139
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:45,796
He, whom we`ve waited
a year to meet

140
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:48,776
He, the one who we hate,

141
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:51,210
He, from whom we want revenge,

142
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,144
Ranbeer Talwar, we`re
coming for you!

143
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:25,908
lt`s 1 1 :30, the kids will
be here any minute

144
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,818
l read somewhere Kids
are just like dogs..

145
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:39,954
..Like dogs, They
too sense true love

146
00:14:40,997 --> 00:14:42,089
And fear too

147
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:42,887
Hi .. Ranbeer

148
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,145
lqbal, Avantika, Aditi, Vashisht

149
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:14,983
Hi, guys. l`m Malaika

150
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,953
My name is Malaika

151
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:24,565
We understand English

152
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:30,971

00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:56,091
This ..is a toy.. to play with!

00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,033
But lt`s for boys

159
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:11,312
This is the girls` room,
so it`s pink!

160
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,207
Specially for Aditi and Avantika

161
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:20,253
Baby, our room will also be pink

162
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:22,517
You know how much l love Pink!

163
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,328
We`ll all stay in one room.

164
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:38,033
But l have designed separate
rooms for boys and girls

165
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:39,165
Pink and blue

166
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:40,333
Ya, exactly !

167
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,004
And anyway how can the four
of you fit in one room?

168
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,344
Our room was smaller, but
we were very comfortable

169
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,247
Lucha Singh will also stay with us

170
00:17:49,452 --> 00:17:51,283
And Sher Singh too

171
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,012
Ewww.. that`s a rat

172
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:56,148
lts not a rat, it`s a hamster!

173
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,417
Shift the other beds

174
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,657
and cupboards in here.. make
them comfortable

What? - Now that all of
us will be together..

What will be the colour of
the room, blue or pink ?

177
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:17,074
Remember, we are not here to stay,

178
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:19,205
but to take revenge
from Ranbeer Talwar.

179
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:21,416
We have to constantly harass him

180
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,042
and make his life miserable.

181
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,553
What lf he gets angry and hits us?

182
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,115
Exactly what we want.

183
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,449
lf he lays a hand on us?

184
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,494
Ranbeer Talwar goes straight to jail

00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:37,057

00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,144

There are so many in this house

192
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:13,596
Why don`t you go to another one ?

193
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:16,335
Exactly ! so why did you come
into my bathroom then ?

194

We can`t eat this

243
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,535
Why can`t you eat Chicken rice?

244
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:50,578

Wish l`d asked for something else
Next time, think before asking

313
00:29:29,784 --> 00:29:32,150
Poor chaps always ask
at the wrong time

314
00:29:32,954 --> 00:29:35,252
Or maybe l listen at the wrong time

315
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:41,157
and this is mega Film
star Binoy Gandhi,

316
00:29:41,263 --> 00:29:42,855

317
00:29:42,964 --> 00:29:45,933
Such dirty thoughts, such evil deeds

00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:53,072
He just won an award,
and You broke his leg

319

322
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:05,084

00:30:53,335 --> 00:30:55,132
She`s a devil in disguise

331
00:30:55,203 --> 00:30:57,000
She does what she wants to

332
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,300
She thinks she`s a queen

333
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:02,141
She`s just a child at heart

334
00:31:02,244 --> 00:31:04,007
Outspoken but innocent

335
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,309

00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,982
The seasons are trinkets at my feet

357
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:29,528
Why then shouldn`t l dance?

358
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:32,857
l`m in a city of fun

359
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:36,797
Why then shouldn`t l sing?

360
00:32:43,912 --> 00:32:47,245
lts dull without her

361
00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:51,112
everything will fall asleep

362
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,245
Curse her as much as you want

363
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,821
Without her everything lifeless..

364
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,486
l`m a song

365
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:04,256
Don`t stop me

366
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,126
Forget your worries

367
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,033
Come sing with me

368
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:13,031
A bubble

369
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,898
A bubble

370
00:33:15,377 --> 00:33:18,312
l`m just a bubble

371
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,211
don`t touch me

372
00:33:22,517 --> 00:33:31,391
Call me softly

373
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:48,400
Geeta, against everyone`s advice..

374
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:50,068
Why do You take others` advice?

375
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:51,269
You`re God

376
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:53,913
May l finish what l was saying?

377
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:56,308
When did l stop you?

378
00:33:58,386 --> 00:33:59,614
OK, OK !

379
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:02,515
l can`t say a word around here

380
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,525
l was saying that against
everybody`s advice,

381
00:34:05,593 --> 00:34:09,529
l have decided to send
you to Earth this time

382
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:13,163
So what`s their problem?

383
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:16,894
Their problem is that they feel
you won`t be able to live

384
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,905
as a human amongst the..

385
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,270
What`s so tough being a human?

386
00:34:21,242 --> 00:34:23,005
They are cry at the drop of hat

387
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:25,637
Can you cry?

388
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:28,178
Ehh..

389
00:34:29,184 --> 00:34:31,948
lt`s your fault we angels can`t cry

390
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,018
Yes, it`s my fault that
fairies do not suffer ..

391
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:35,916
l`ve made sure that
in heaven you angels

392
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,959
have no pain, no tears
only joy and happiness

393
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:43,224
Wait a minute, can`t l use
my magical powers to cry?

394
00:34:43,531 --> 00:34:46,967
Oh yes, no using of magical
powers in front of anybody

395
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:49,298
l remember, don`t worry

396
00:34:49,404 --> 00:34:51,031
Just tell me what l`ve to do

397
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:58,940
You have to go and help the
Wallia children and Ranbeer

398
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:01,939
This is the house.. the children

399
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,687
What have You done to them?

400
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:14,484
poor kids, sho shweet little babies

401
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:18,697
You have to get the kids
and Ranbeer together

402
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:29,133
But you`ve already done that

403
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:32,711
This task is not as easy as it seems

404
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:35,608
Even for You? You can
do it in a flash !

405
00:35:36,284 --> 00:35:39,344
Yes, but then how will they learn

406
00:35:39,621 --> 00:35:40,679
What they have to along the way?

407
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,422
Wow! You are very smart

408
00:35:44,993 --> 00:35:46,051
OK, can l ask?

409
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,654
When Ranbeer and the
kids come together,

410
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,055
you get back here, understand ?

411
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:52,628
Now may l say something?

412
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,626
Yeeeeaaahhhhhhh

413
00:35:54,702 --> 00:35:57,102
And remember what l told you

414
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:04,309
SORRY.. sorry

415
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:14,121
l just spoke to my designer

416
00:36:14,222 --> 00:36:17,589
He suggested a pink
border With blue text

417
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:20,751
The kids have just arrived
And baby colours are in

418
00:36:21,029 --> 00:36:22,087
Aren`t we lucky?

419
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:26,129
Malaika it`s a classified ad,
no colours are required

420
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,592
Just a few simple words saying

421
00:36:28,703 --> 00:36:31,137
we need a nanny for the kids..

422
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:32,566
That`s it .. alright.

423
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:37,572
Now they want to change
Our Granny, too?

424
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,048
Not Granny, but Nanny. Nanny means..

425
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,343
A house-maid?

426
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,677
No, a Nanny only looks
after the children

427
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,620
A Nanny to look after us? Right!

428
00:36:48,723 --> 00:36:51,658
When our uncles and our aunts
failed to look after us,

429
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,159
is this Nanny going to
drop from the skies?

430
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,077
You told Geeta not to use
her magical powers..

431
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,514
..in front of anyone, right ?

432
00:37:17,552 --> 00:37:18,610
Yes

433
00:37:19,087 --> 00:37:22,079
Well, your precious angel is cycling

434
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:25,125
down a rainbow in broad daylight

435
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:50,675
Look, there`s someone on the rainbow

436
00:37:50,785 --> 00:37:52,116
What are doing lqbal?

437
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:56,116
Look there`s a girl cycling
down the rainbow

438
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,610
Hey Pappu! how`s you ? Everything
hunky dorey ?

439
00:38:52,714 --> 00:38:54,545
Dorey.. but who are you ?

440
00:38:55,183 --> 00:38:56,241

441
00:38:57,552 --> 00:38:59,816
Who are you ? Pappu

442
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:02,216
Why`re you firing Pappu ?

443
00:39:02,523 --> 00:39:05,617
When l decide to go somewhere,
l just go

444
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:08,261
Who`s Pappu to stop me?

445
00:39:08,563 --> 00:39:11,623
And why are you always
such a temper?

446
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,824
Pappu!

447
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,492
There you go again, Pappu!

448
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,229
Pappu!
- Run, Pappu ..

449
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:17,804
What do you mean, run Pappu?

450
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,638
Who are you, what do you want?

451
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,401
Who am l?

452
00:39:21,576 --> 00:39:24,477
How many times should l repeat
myself to you and to your Pappu ?

453
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:29,243
For the last time.. l
have some respect too

454
00:39:29,484 --> 00:39:30,644
My name is Geeta, got that? Geeta.

455
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:32,948
Geeta? Who Geeta?

456
00:39:33,254 --> 00:39:35,222
Geeta, as in the Bhagwad Geeta,

457
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,654
Seeta Aur Geeta, Geeta Bhawan.

458
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,656
They serve really nice
snacks in Geeta Bhawan,

459
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,751
have you tried them ?

460
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,955
Oh God, your forehead
is all creased up.

461
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:46,961
Your tempers` back! you`re
a pro at this temper thing,

462
00:39:47,268 --> 00:39:48,895
hardly something to be a pro at

463
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,768
OK OK, let`s get down to business.

464
00:39:51,906 --> 00:39:54,739
l`m the new Nanny you wanted.

465
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,577
Oh, Nanny. But l told Malaika
just moments ago

466
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,242
that you need a Nanny,
and the Nanny`s here.

467
00:40:03,351 --> 00:40:05,512
That`s the power of technology
and thought

468
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,746
Technology and thought?

469
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:08,414
You thought , and l arrived

470
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:09,647
And technology?

471
00:40:09,757 --> 00:40:11,987
That was only to show you that

472
00:40:12,293 --> 00:40:15,785
l`m savy with big words
like TECH-NO-LO-G Y

473
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,525
Are you sure you can handle
a nanny`s job ?

474
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:19,895
You seem to be so.. rustic

475
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,631
Oh.. so do you want someone

476
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:22,999
who can speak very good English?

477
00:40:23,304 --> 00:40:24,362
You speak English?

478
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,273
oh yes l sure do and German too,

479
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,478
but l`m out of practice.

480
00:40:31,612 --> 00:40:32,874
You see, Hitler died
and went to Hell,

481
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,470
and l`m an angel from Heaven..

482
00:40:35,283 --> 00:40:36,648
Oops, l`m so sorry

483
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:37,842
What`s all this rubbish?

484
00:40:38,286 --> 00:40:39,344
Rubbish?

485
00:40:39,754 --> 00:40:42,018
ls my mouth a dust bin that
rubbish comes out of it ?

486
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:44,723
All l`m saying is that
Malaika sent me.

487
00:40:44,892 --> 00:40:46,291
Malaika sent you?
- Hmmmm..

488
00:40:46,394 --> 00:40:47,452
Why didn`t you say so earlier?

489
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:50,392
You didn`t ask, that`s why!

490
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,026
But how could Malaika
send you so fast ?

491
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:54,991
l just spoke to her

492
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,668
Either you get angry too fast,
or you think too much

493
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,032
Where are the kids?
Let`s get to work

494
00:41:02,343 --> 00:41:03,435
First sensible thing you`ve
uttered from your mouth

495
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:07,974
How rude are you? you
must speak politely

496
00:41:08,316 --> 00:41:10,944
You`ve a got a lot to learn,
but first the kids

497
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,519
the kids always come first

498
00:41:12,653 --> 00:41:14,314
Did Malaika discuss money?

499
00:41:14,422 --> 00:41:16,413
Money?

500
00:41:16,657 --> 00:41:18,522
You`ve got lots of money,
you just give me some

501
00:41:18,693 --> 00:41:21,662
l don`t need any leave, l`m
here to work, not holiday

502
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:25,059
OK, can l see the kids now?

503
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:27,400
Nice meeting you

504
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:31,698
O God, as if the kids weren`t
enough, one more headache

505
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:33,899
Headache? Want a head massage?

506
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:35,441
No, please leave me alone.

507
00:41:35,543 --> 00:41:37,943
Go and look after the
kids.. if you can

508
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:48,086
How long will she last?

509
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:49,781
24 hours?

510
00:41:49,957 --> 00:41:51,083
No, 12!

511
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:53,091
12? Wow!

512
00:41:53,628 --> 00:41:56,927
Common.. common.. run! run!

513
00:42:02,703 --> 00:42:04,102
Closed the door properly?

514
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,405
Yes, where the hell
did you come from ?

515
00:42:07,642 --> 00:42:10,440
Oh no, that`s so impolite.

516
00:42:10,745 --> 00:42:12,804
Ranbeer is really a bad
influence on you all

517
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,379
l told you she can go
everywhere any time

518
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,439
Wait Avantika

Oh yeah, lqbal, She knows

521
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,448

00:42:33,868 --> 00:42:37,133
My name`s Geeta. l`m your new Nanny.

528
00:42:37,438 --> 00:42:41,033
But l don`t like to be
called Nanny-Fanny.

529
00:42:41,442 --> 00:42:44,502
So you`ll call me Didi which
means elder sister, OK ?

530
00:42:44,912 --> 00:42:47,472
Ok Didi

531
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:50,710

entire house later

534
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:02,459
And this is the Study

535
00:43:02,964 --> 00:43:07,492
Study? The English quit lndia, but
forgot to take Ranbeer with them

536
00:43:08,102 --> 00:43:10,866
ls this house in London
or Delhi? Study!

537
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:34,192
Butterfly`s in the house!

538
00:43:34,495 --> 00:43:35,962
What`ll be there in
the garden then ?

539
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,192
So this is the study, eh?

540
00:43:39,734 --> 00:43:41,463
Wonder if anyone really
does any studying in here

541
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,593
this way.. please

542
00:43:55,516 --> 00:43:56,915
This is the swimming pool

543
00:43:57,018 --> 00:43:58,076
Hmmm..

544
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,914
Do you how to swim?
- No.

545
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:05,786
Ohhh.. so you can`t swim, at all

546
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:16,866
Take a look at that tree, Didi

547
00:44:17,004 --> 00:44:18,062
What`s there?

548
00:44:18,172 --> 00:44:20,231
A bird building its nest
- Where?

549
00:44:20,674 --> 00:44:22,505
On that branch, there

550
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:54,266
What fun.. How sweet.
Thank you Aditi

551
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:19,989
And this is the garden.. with a
lake over there.. Ranbeer`s room..

552
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:24,294
which has a balcony, which faces the
garden, which is right on the lake.

553
00:45:24,738 --> 00:45:26,296
lf only Delhi had an ocean

554
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:54,328
Such pleasant breeze Vashisht.

555
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:56,232
How sweet Vashisht

556
00:46:02,977 --> 00:46:05,036
And what have you planned
for my welcome ?

557
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:08,976
l did not remove your toothpaste
and put flour in it !

558
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:15,816
Anything else you want
to show me, Vashisht?

559
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:32,100
Don`t just stand there and
look at me.. help me down

560
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,722
All dressed up and nowhere to go
- What?

561
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:55,257
Why are you so suited n
booted to watch stars ?

562
00:46:55,663 --> 00:46:56,721
What the hell are you doing here?

563
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:01,099
There you go again being
rude a question like that

564
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:03,165
can have many answers

565
00:47:03,704 --> 00:47:05,296
Oh shut up will you?
Where are the kids?

566
00:47:05,706 --> 00:47:08,732
Now that`s a question with only
one answer. The kids are sleeping

567
00:47:09,043 --> 00:47:10,874
Sleeping? Wow!

568
00:47:11,145 --> 00:47:12,271
What`s so wow about that?

569
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,773
You don`t expect them
to get all dressed up

570
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:16,041
and sit at home like you, do you ?

571
00:47:17,051 --> 00:47:19,212
l`m waiting for Malaika,
we`re going out

572
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,311
Very good, you must go out with
her, when did l stop you?

573
00:47:21,722 --> 00:47:23,781
But why am l telling you all this?

574
00:47:24,058 --> 00:47:26,424
l don`t know Ranbeer, l didn`t
even ask - Ranbeer?

575
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,122
You`re gonna call me Ranbeer?

576
00:47:28,295 --> 00:47:29,990
lf l don`t call Ranbeer, Ranbeer,
then what should l call him? Raanu?

577
00:47:31,732 --> 00:47:33,029
Aah Malaika

578
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,696
Aah Malaika ! Let`s see
who this Aah Malaika is !

579
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:41,899
Hi Baby, you`re looking so nice

580
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:44,810
From which angle does
he look like a baby ?

581
00:47:44,912 --> 00:47:46,436
Who`s she?
- She`s Geeta !

582
00:47:46,814 --> 00:47:51,012
You don`t know her? She`s the
new Nanny you sent for the kids

583
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,018
Me? l didn`t send anyone?

584
00:47:53,754 --> 00:47:54,812
What? Don`t you know her?

585
00:47:54,888 --> 00:47:56,753
Not at all, first time l`m
seeing something that

586
00:47:56,857 --> 00:47:58,017
looks like a dog`s stuck in a gill

587
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,183
What is she saying?

588
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,989
No hang on.. You said
Malaika sent you

589
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:02,929
Of course Malaika sent me

590
00:48:03,063 --> 00:48:04,155
Well, she`s Malaika!

591
00:48:04,898 --> 00:48:06,832
God! When did l say she`s Sushila?

592
00:48:07,835 --> 00:48:09,928
Listen, you said Malaika sent you,

593
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:12,470
this is Malaika, and
she did not send you

594
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,938
l said Malaika sent me, this is
Malaika but she didn`t send me,

595
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:18,476
because Malaika Arora sent me,

596
00:48:18,746 --> 00:48:21,340
and she isn`t Malaika Arora
so she didn`t send me,

597
00:48:21,448 --> 00:48:23,382
but Malaika Arora did, got it ?

598
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:24,746
Who`s Malaika Arora?

599
00:48:24,918 --> 00:48:28,945
Malaika Arora.. wife of Arbaaz?
Arbaaz ya? Salman`s brother?

600
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:30,215
You know Salman?

601
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,292
Hey girl, relax..

602
00:48:32,393 --> 00:48:36,056
..l said l know Malaika, when
did l say l know Salman?

603
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,192
Listen, l have to go
- Me with you..

604
00:48:38,799 --> 00:48:40,130
He has very bad temper.

605
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,497
Give him some subza mixed in milk
every night. He`ll cool down

606
00:48:43,771 --> 00:48:44,863
But what`s subza?

607
00:48:44,972 --> 00:48:47,133
You don`t know subza ? They`re
tiny black little seeds

608
00:48:47,241 --> 00:48:48,299
l`ll get them for you

609
00:48:48,409 --> 00:48:51,435
Ranbeer, she`s lied to get the
job Won`t you do something?

610
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,213
She`s good with the kids

611
00:48:54,815 --> 00:48:57,147
put them to bed so early,
that`s all that matters

612
00:48:57,251 --> 00:48:58,513
Baby you`re just so smart!

613
00:48:58,819 --> 00:49:00,309
Baby you`re just so smart!

614
00:49:02,389 --> 00:49:04,414
Re maa maa re maa maa re..

615
00:49:04,491 --> 00:49:05,788
What song is that?

616
00:49:05,926 --> 00:49:09,054
l`ll teach you.. we went to the
market to get some potatoes..

617
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:11,893
Ranbeer`s gone out.. meeting`s
in the kitchen, five minutes

618
00:49:24,411 --> 00:49:27,539
lf Ranbeer hasn`t brought her..
she can`t be on his side

619
00:49:28,082 --> 00:49:29,913
Then whose side is she on?

620
00:49:30,184 --> 00:49:33,176
Forget sides, she`s
just too dangerous

621
00:49:33,287 --> 00:49:34,345
No, she`s nice

622
00:49:34,855 --> 00:49:36,186
She can do anything

623
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:41,259
ldea! lf she can do anything,
then lets get her on our side?

624
00:49:41,428 --> 00:49:44,488
Good idea , but how can we trust her

625
00:49:44,865 --> 00:49:47,197
lt will be better if you
don`t trust me at all

626
00:49:53,006 --> 00:49:56,339
Avantika, do you have any
reason to trust me ?

627
00:49:56,877 --> 00:49:58,845
What ?
- You didn`t do anything to me..

628
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,039
..because l didn`t play
a prank on you,

629
00:50:01,115 --> 00:50:02,878
and you always listen to me

630
00:50:02,983 --> 00:50:06,043
True, but that doesn`t mean
lqbal will trust me

631
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:10,523
You don`t like that Barbie doll
Mallaika, nor has she sent you

632
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:14,921
And the way you trouble Ranbeer,
it`s very funny

633
00:50:17,464 --> 00:50:19,591
Even l don`t like that
stuck-up Ranbeer,

634
00:50:19,867 --> 00:50:23,166
but that doesn`t mean
Vashisht will trust me

635
00:50:51,932 --> 00:50:52,990
Good morning

636
00:50:56,937 --> 00:50:57,995
What are you doing here ?

637
00:50:58,105 --> 00:50:59,367
Do you know what day it is?

638
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:06,139
Get up, go and wish her.. now don`t
ask who ? Aditi, it`s her birthday

639
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:14,216
Now what? You`re wondering about
her gift, right ? Don`t worry..

640
00:51:14,955 --> 00:51:16,183
look under the pillow

641
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,381
Under the pillow..

642
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,392
Such a small deal and you
made it into a big one

643
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,561
there`s your gift for Aditi

644
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,130
Come on, let`s go to the
Blue Room right away!

645
00:51:24,398 --> 00:51:26,025
Listen.. please leave me alone.

646
00:51:26,433 --> 00:51:28,230
Will you get out of
my bedroom please..

647
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:49,112
why someone can make your
heart skip a beat

648
00:51:50,057 --> 00:51:58,965
Why the scent of someone,
lingers on in your breath

649
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:05,061
Why do lips quiver, unable to say

650
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:09,605
That her hesitation, is her
expressing her need for love

651
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,008
Did you ever think

652
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,174
Happy Birthday Aditi

653
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,408
Thank you

654
00:52:17,518 --> 00:52:19,713
Look Didi, what we made for you

Happy Birthday. Addu-kaddu

656
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,549

..we`ll all go out somewhere
to celebrate Aditi`s birthday

660
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:34,360
YEHHH..

661
00:52:34,434 --> 00:52:36,368
But where?
- That`s a surprise

662
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,461
l don`t want to go anywhere
- Why not?

663
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,732
l don`t like birthdays

664
00:52:41,174 --> 00:52:43,005
Happy Birthday, Aditi

665
00:52:43,377 --> 00:52:44,435
Thank you

666
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,447

00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,758
l can`t do all this

672
00:53:08,368 --> 00:53:09,426
You can`t all this?

673
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:18,506
lt`s not about you!
She was crying..

674
00:53:19,379 --> 00:53:21,040
she was missing her parents ..

675
00:53:22,649 --> 00:53:25,140
you should be there for
her at a time like this

676
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,680

This is the surprise ?

685
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,087
When school gets boring

686
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,714
our teachers bring us here
to punish us some more

687
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:06,315
Everything is so old

688
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:09,122
This is going to be my worst
birthday ever - Chee..

689
00:54:11,298 --> 00:54:13,391
Come on, let`s go Didi

690
00:54:15,102 --> 00:54:18,196
Didi.. didi..

691
00:54:20,741 --> 00:54:30,742
[ Skipped item nr. 691 ]

692
00:54:20,741 --> 00:54:30,742
[ Skipped item nr. 692 ]

693
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:50,326
We can snatch the stars with our
hands, right out of the sky

694
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:59,510
We can grab the Moon and put it
in a Tiffin, if we so desire

695
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:08,253
We can snatch the stars with our
hands, right out of the sky

696
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:12,791
We can grab the Moon and put it
in a Tiffin, if we so desire

697
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:17,193
Our Country`s come a long way,
with still further to go

698
00:55:17,297 --> 00:55:23,702
The world is going to see,
how far we can go

699
00:55:23,804 --> 00:55:28,173
Our glorious past can teach us a lot

700
00:55:28,341 --> 00:55:32,607
We`ll use the promise of the future
to strengthen our today

701
00:55:32,813 --> 00:55:37,216
Our glorious past can teach us a lot

702
00:55:37,317 --> 00:55:42,482
We`ll use the promise of the future
to strengthen our today

703
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:08,509
lndians and dogs not allowed
- who wrote that ?

704
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,277
Those who did yesterday,
today know that ..

705
00:56:11,585 --> 00:56:15,316
lndia is shinning brighter
than the sun

706
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:20,325
A new tomorrow restlessly awaits us

707
00:56:20,594 --> 00:56:24,724
The future is asking us
where we want to be

708
00:56:24,898 --> 00:56:29,301
This is our moment, lets grab it

709
00:56:29,402 --> 00:56:33,429
We shall make the whole world,
dance to our tune

710
00:56:33,573 --> 00:56:39,876
The world is going to see,
how far we can go

711
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:44,440
Our glorious past can teach us a lot

712
00:56:44,618 --> 00:56:48,884
We`ll use the promise of the future
to strengthen our today

713
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:53,426
Our glorious past can teach us a lot

714
00:56:53,627 --> 00:56:58,690
We`ll use the promise of the future
to strengthen our today

715
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:52,416
They say we`re progressing, but are
We all going ahead, or just a few ?

716
00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:54,043
That`s a very good question.

717
00:57:56,389 --> 00:58:00,621
Don`t call it a smile,
if you smile alone

718
00:58:00,861 --> 00:58:04,957
lf we all don`t go ahead,
its not progress

719
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:09,434
l don`t want the sun to
brighten just my yard

720
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:13,835
and the rain to just
sing on my umbrella

721
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:18,400
Lets paint a picture
that has us all in it

722
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:24,915
The world is going to see,
how far we can go

723
00:58:25,018 --> 00:58:29,387
Our glorious past can teach us a lot

724
00:58:29,522 --> 00:58:33,822
We`ll use the promise of the future
to strengthen our today

725
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,420
Our glorious past can teach us a lot

726
00:58:38,665 --> 00:58:43,466
We`ll use the promise of the future
to strengthen our today

727
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:28,880
Our glorious past can teach us a lot

728
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:33,419
We`ll use the promise of the future
to strengthen our today

729
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,889
Our glorious past can teach us a lot

730
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:42,485
We`ll use the promise of the future
to strengthen our today

731
00:59:42,595 --> 00:59:46,793
Our glorious past can teach us a lot

732
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,165
We`ll use the promise of the future
to strengthen our today

733
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:08,048
That was fun, Didi. l wish they
taught like that in school too

734
01:00:08,121 --> 01:00:11,648
What fun ! l`d leave my teachers
back in Aurangzeb`s time

735
01:00:12,459 --> 01:00:14,518
Come on come on, get into your room

736
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:23,024
Come on go to sleep, otherwise
you`ll get minus points

737
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:26,701
Stop fighting lqbal, or you`ll be
the first one to get minus points

738
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,932
Minus points?
Who`s giving us points

739
01:00:29,009 --> 01:00:30,067
God

740
01:00:31,611 --> 01:00:35,479
You`re laughing? You don`t
know about God`s points?

741
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:36,606
No

742
01:00:36,683 --> 01:00:38,617
No one told you?
- No

743
01:00:38,752 --> 01:00:41,016
No problem, l`ll tell you

744
01:00:41,621 --> 01:00:47,617
lmagine we`re all in a huge
game show, hosted by God .

745
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:52,831
Whenever we do something good,
like tell the truth, help someone,

746
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:57,632
forgive someone who has been bad
to us, or go to bed on time,

747
01:00:57,771 --> 01:01:01,502
or any such good deeds,
we get plus points.

748
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:07,035
lf we do something bad, like
tell a lie, trouble someone,

749
01:01:07,113 --> 01:01:11,516
break someone`s heart, litter the
streets or keep our rooms dirty,

750
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:14,985
any such bad deeds,
we get minus points

751
01:01:15,055 --> 01:01:17,046
What do we get with these points?

752
01:01:17,123 --> 01:01:19,250
Good things happen to us
when we have plus points,

753
01:01:19,526 --> 01:01:21,517
and with minus points, bad things.

754
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:26,525
We must do good things every
day to earn plus points

755
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:31,000
And when we have lots of plus
points then as a bonus,

756
01:01:31,071 --> 01:01:33,539
God fulfills our wishes

757
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:36,606
Ranbeer must be having
very few points

758
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:39,870
As of now

759
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,676
But if he truly repents
for his mistakes..

760
01:01:42,749 --> 01:01:44,148
..he`ll also earn plus points

761
01:01:44,684 --> 01:01:48,552
How can he get plus points
after all he has done?

762
01:01:49,155 --> 01:01:52,556
He will have to do a lot of good
things to earn plus points

763
01:01:52,759 --> 01:01:57,162
So what did we do so wrong that
got us so many minus points,

764
01:01:57,297 --> 01:02:00,630
that God took away our
parents from us ?

765
01:02:12,779 --> 01:02:17,045
You think God is unkind because
he did this to you ?

766
01:02:17,584 --> 01:02:21,577
That`s not so.. He doesn`t make
all the bad things happen

767
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:24,718
Even he feels upset
about such things,

768
01:02:24,858 --> 01:02:28,589
feels very sad, but no
one can change destiny

769
01:02:28,862 --> 01:02:31,592
But l thought God can
do anything he wants to

770
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:35,597
Whenever children like
you suffer bad things,

771
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:38,000
He gives you the strength
to fight it

772
01:02:38,805 --> 01:02:42,605
How can we check our points?
ls there a website?

773
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:47,677
Close your eyes, honestly
remember all the good

774
01:02:47,747 --> 01:02:51,945
and bad things you`ve done,
you`ll know your points

775
01:02:53,153 --> 01:02:56,145
Points? Rubbish!

776
01:03:11,638 --> 01:03:12,696
Why didn`t you come?

777
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:14,704
What are you doing here?

778
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,774
Don`t change the topic.

779
01:03:16,843 --> 01:03:18,902
Why didn`t you come for
Aditi`s birthday ?

780
01:03:19,312 --> 01:03:21,780
l don`t owe you any explanations

781
01:03:22,115 --> 01:03:23,173
You do

782
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:26,642
You`ll have to pay more attention
to the kids from today

783
01:03:26,786 --> 01:03:28,720
Who are you to talk
to me like that ?

784
01:03:28,788 --> 01:03:31,052
You don`t even know
their names properly

785
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:48,730
This is Aditi, this is Avantika,
this is lqbal and this is Vashisht

786
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:56,348
You have no idea what my equation
or relationship with these kids is,

787
01:03:58,284 --> 01:04:02,744
so don`t interfere in what
you don`t understand !

788
01:04:02,956 --> 01:04:04,685
l don`t understand what?

789
01:04:04,824 --> 01:04:07,349
That you feel guilty to
go in front of them

790
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:09,952
because you killed their parents ?

791
01:04:13,233 --> 01:04:14,700
Look, This is my problem.

792
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,229
No one understands what
l`m going through,

793
01:04:18,972 --> 01:04:20,701
nor do l want anybody`s sympathy.

794
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:25,434
You think l`m not affected
by what has happened ?

795
01:04:26,045 --> 01:04:28,980
l know you`re sorry
for whats happened,

796
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:32,111
but you`re sorry only feeling
sorry for yourself

797
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:36,718
Have you ever genuinely tried to
win them over from your heart ?

798
01:04:37,323 --> 01:04:41,054
Have you ever tried to understand
what they must be going through?

799
01:04:41,928 --> 01:04:45,125
When you forget your pain
and think or theirs,

800
01:04:45,198 --> 01:04:47,063
only then will you be
able to win them over.

801
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:52,871
Don`t try and built relationships
around selfish needs,

802
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:55,737
they`ll never last, but
where there`s true love..

803
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:58,402
..those bonds last forever

804
01:05:10,757 --> 01:05:19,893
Why does it feel, like
something is incomplete

805
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:30,034
The moon is complete,
yet doesn`t appear so

806
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:39,979
Why does it feel, like
something is incomplete

807
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:50,251
The moon is complete,
yet doesn`t appear so

808
01:05:50,997 --> 01:05:56,264
ln the oysters of ones eyes,
their dreams are like pearls

809
01:05:56,402 --> 01:06:01,396
The pearls are expressing
their need for love

810
01:06:27,834 --> 01:06:32,567
Who says l can`t talk to the kids?
How difficult can it be?

811
01:06:33,973 --> 01:06:38,842
Morning.. no no, needs more warmth

812
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:48,180
Hello, Good morning ! Sounds
as if l`m a kid, not them

813
01:06:49,188 --> 01:06:57,061
Hmmm.. Hello, Good morning ! no
that`s like totally wrong..

814
01:06:58,131 --> 01:06:59,189
Aahh

815
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,863
Hello, good morning !

816
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:06,862
Hello, good morning !

817
01:07:07,206 --> 01:07:09,071
Hello, good morning !

818
01:07:11,477 --> 01:07:13,411
Hello, good morning !

819
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:30,019
Pappu !

820
01:07:34,367 --> 01:07:36,164
Pa..
- Yes!!..

821
01:07:36,436 --> 01:07:37,903
Where are all my clothes?

822
01:07:39,238 --> 01:07:44,437
You sent them to me through Aditi
to send them to the laundry

823
01:07:48,114 --> 01:07:50,582
Hello, Good morning!

824
01:07:53,386 --> 01:07:55,445
Hello.. Good morning

825
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,384
Good morning

826
01:07:59,058 --> 01:08:00,923
Why is this villain so happy?

827
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:03,060
Aren`t you going to
the office today?

828
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:06,928
No, l`ll work from home today,

829
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,597
and spend some time with you guys
- With all of you

830
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:13,062
Excuse me?

831
01:08:13,206 --> 01:08:15,003
Please say it politely

832
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:20,544
l`m sorry, l`ll spend time with
all of you charming children..

833
01:08:20,613 --> 01:08:22,274
But we`re going to school

834
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:23,940
So you go to office

835
01:08:24,417 --> 01:08:25,679
Shall l call for the car

836
01:08:39,432 --> 01:08:40,956
What happened?

837
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:42,091
Run..

838
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:06,522
So, everything is going fine

839
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:12,326
The kids and l understand
each other very well

840
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:18,535
Good.. good, good

841
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:30,012
So.. l have to go to LA
for a few days.. May l?

842
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,141
Sure.

843
01:09:34,153 --> 01:09:36,018
l`ll come over to your house
for an inspection.

844
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:40,752
lf everything`s OK, you
and the kids can go to LA

845
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:48,556
But Your Honour, the kids have just
settled in, can`t l go alone ?

846
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:52,363
Why? Now that you`re
all well settled in,

847
01:09:53,239 --> 01:09:55,036
a holiday together seems
like a good idea

848
01:09:55,575 --> 01:09:59,705
Holiday? l`ve to go there
on important business,

849
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:02,046
and the kids can stay with Geeta..

850
01:10:03,049 --> 01:10:04,107
Who`s Geeta?

851
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:09,654
Their Nanny.. maid.. their Didi

852
01:10:10,056 --> 01:10:12,047
You`ve kept the kids with a nanny?

853
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:16,060
lt`s not like that. They love her
a lot, she loves them a lot,

854
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:17,459
they love me a lot,
l love them a lot,

855
01:10:17,597 --> 01:10:24,400
basically we all love
each other a lot

856
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:28,398
When will you come?

857
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:35,611
Whenever l feel like..

01:10:40,086 --> 01:10:42,077
Can you please come before the 25th,

Goodbye.. your honour..

Thank you sir..

863
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:10,433
Sir

864
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:24,776
Look at them with love..
look into their hearts..

865
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:30,979
try to understand them,
their dreams

866
01:13:45,805 --> 01:13:52,005
Hi baby. How was your day, tired?

867
01:13:52,278 --> 01:13:56,806
Oh is my baby tired?

let`s go home, common lets go

869

What is there in your pocket?
- Leave me!! Leave me!!

872
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:49,591
How can you call Vashisht
your brother ?

01:14:49,668 --> 01:14:52,933
looks like They found
you on the streets

874
01:15:26,906 --> 01:15:28,373
You?
- Politely

875
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,566
Shhh..
- Shh..

876
01:15:31,577 --> 01:15:33,704
What`re you doing here ?

877
01:15:34,647 --> 01:15:38,378
Me ?.. the kids.. uh

878
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:39,508
Kids ?

879
01:15:39,585 --> 01:15:40,643
Dreams

880
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:41,777
Dreams ?

881
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:44,453
You won`t understand

882
01:15:48,661 --> 01:15:57,865
Why does it feel, like
something is incomplete

883
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:08,076
The moon is complete,
yet doesn`t appear so

884
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:14,150
ln the oysters of ones eyes,
their dreams are like pearls

885
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:18,754
The pearls are expressing
their need for love

886
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,486
Did you ever think

887
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:26,157
lqbal, wake up

888
01:16:26,565 --> 01:16:28,089
lqbal last warning.. or
l`ll pour water on you

889
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:31,898
l can`t go to school,
l`ve got a stomach-ache

890
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:35,769
That`s enough lqbal. Stop acting
and let`s go to school

891
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:39,443
Please let me sleep

892
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:41,445
Didi, lqbal`s not getting
ready to go to school.

893
01:16:41,513 --> 01:16:43,174
did you find my note-book ?

894
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:02,998
l`m not lying, l have
a bad stomach ache

895
01:17:03,602 --> 01:17:05,467
lqbal get up

896
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:08,005
Let him rest if he`s not well

897
01:17:10,943 --> 01:17:12,137
Who`s asking you ?

898
01:17:12,678 --> 01:17:15,943
l really have a bad stomach-ache

899
01:17:16,015 --> 01:17:17,676
So don`t go to school, simple

900
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:20,142
l can take care of my
brother and sisters

901
01:17:20,619 --> 01:17:24,749
lqbal stop this and get up
Enough lqbal, come on now

902
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:27,821
l think he is really unwell.

903
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:31,492
And he is not going to school,
and that`s final Vashisht

904
01:17:50,049 --> 01:17:51,175
You again

905
01:17:54,787 --> 01:17:55,845
hmmmm..

906
01:18:14,873 --> 01:18:16,807
That`ll hurt your stomach even more

907
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,874
Haven`t done your homework,
or is there a test today ?

908
01:18:27,019 --> 01:18:28,953
When l used to not do my homework,

909
01:18:29,021 --> 01:18:32,616
or if there was a test, even
my stomach would hurt

910
01:18:33,892 --> 01:18:36,622
l secretly used to dip the
thermometer in hot milk

911
01:18:37,696 --> 01:18:40,164
Once the milk was so hot,
the thermometer broke

912
01:18:42,234 --> 01:18:46,295
So, homework not done
or was there a test ?

913
01:18:46,572 --> 01:18:47,630
Nothing, just ..

914
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,698
There is something?

915
01:18:50,909 --> 01:18:51,967
Girl problem ?

916
01:18:52,244 --> 01:18:53,643
More serious

917
01:18:55,781 --> 01:18:56,975
Can l be of some help ?

918
01:18:58,317 --> 01:18:59,579
Try me out

919
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:01,646
Nobody can understand

920
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:04,789
So what`s the harm in talking then?

921
01:19:08,127 --> 01:19:09,924
l don`t want to be a Sikh

922
01:19:12,064 --> 01:19:15,261
l don`t want to be a Sikh. Why
can`t l be like Vashisht ?

923
01:19:15,801 --> 01:19:18,065
why don`t you want to be a Sikh

924
01:19:18,203 --> 01:19:20,865
The kids tease me at school,

925
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:26,137
they say l`m not Vashisht`s brother
because l`m a Sikh and he isn`t

926
01:19:26,945 --> 01:19:28,810
You know how Sikhs came into being?

927
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:34,342
Many many years ago, there was a
lot of blood-shed in our country.

928
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:38,620
Guru Gobind then asked
that the eldest..

929
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:43,024
.. and bravest son from each
family become a Sikh,

930
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:47,765
to protect his family and society

931
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:50,092
Even today..

932
01:19:50,169 --> 01:19:52,637
..the Sikh Regiment in our army
is considered to be the bravest

933
01:19:52,704 --> 01:19:57,767
But l`m still not Vashisht ,
Avantika and Aditi`s real brother

934
01:19:58,310 --> 01:20:00,642
Families are not created
by birth alone, lqbal,

935
01:20:00,913 --> 01:20:02,642
love makes for stronger
bonds and families,

936
01:20:02,915 --> 01:20:04,644
like Yashomati and lord Krishna.

937
01:20:06,318 --> 01:20:08,843
Never think you are
any less than others.

938
01:20:09,655 --> 01:20:11,782
You were found on the
gurudwara steps,

939
01:20:12,791 --> 01:20:14,782
You are truly gods favorite son

940
01:20:19,731 --> 01:20:24,191
Next time you have a stomach
ache, be sure to tell me

941
01:20:25,671 --> 01:20:28,868
But we can`t be friends
in front of Vashisht

942
01:20:29,141 --> 01:20:30,802
Of course not

943
01:20:30,876 --> 01:20:32,741
Deal?
- What`s this?

944
01:20:32,811 --> 01:20:34,073
it means deal..

945
01:20:34,146 --> 01:20:36,011
that`s how you do deal ?
- Hmm..

946
01:20:36,148 --> 01:20:37,410
This is how l do a deal

947
01:20:38,016 --> 01:20:39,074
Deal..

948
01:20:39,151 --> 01:20:40,209
Deal !

949
01:20:43,155 --> 01:20:48,354
You`re not as bad as we
thought.. Thank you

950
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:52,688
One down three to go

951
01:20:59,304 --> 01:21:03,707
Ranbeer, it`s urgent.
Divya`s in Singapore.

952
01:21:03,775 --> 01:21:05,902
Prada is launching a new
range of bags today

953
01:21:05,978 --> 01:21:07,036
Hmmm.. hmm..

954
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:09,706
Shall l ask her to get
me Prada Napa Messenger

955
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:11,442
or Prada Napa Hobo Fringe ?

956
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:12,841
Great..

957
01:21:12,918 --> 01:21:14,715
Sharman, all my latest costings,

958
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:16,913
strategies everything, were
only on my home computer.

959
01:21:16,989 --> 01:21:18,718
You just have to retrieve them.

960
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:21,315
No one in Delhi has
a Napa Messenger,

961
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,722
and Divya`s promised me,

962
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:25,319
the bag she gets for me she
wont get for herself - Ya

963
01:21:25,998 --> 01:21:27,727
lf you don`t retrieve those files,

964
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:30,324
l`ll have to do two months`
work done in six days,

965
01:21:30,402 --> 01:21:31,460
and that`s just not possible

966
01:21:31,536 --> 01:21:35,336
Listen which one should l get,
Napa Messenger or Hobo Fringe?

967
01:21:35,407 --> 01:21:36,465
Good

968
01:21:36,742 --> 01:21:40,735
Good? what good ? You aren`t
listening are you ?

969
01:21:40,879 --> 01:21:41,937
Yup?..

970
01:21:42,214 --> 01:21:44,739
Yup.. just get lost..

971
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:55,483
Do you also want a bag
from Singapore ?

972
01:21:58,363 --> 01:22:01,764
lf l were busy with my work,
would you disturb me ?

973
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:03,095
No

974
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:06,103
Would you get angry if l
forgot your birthday ?

975
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:07,399
No

976
01:22:07,472 --> 01:22:09,906
Would you be angry lf l
didn`t send you flowers ?

977
01:22:09,975 --> 01:22:11,237
No

978
01:22:11,376 --> 01:22:13,503
Why can`t Malaika be like you?

979
01:22:14,446 --> 01:22:18,246
You know, you should be my
girlfriend, not Malaika

980
01:22:18,317 --> 01:22:19,375
No

981
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:21,243
Why not?

982
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,311
Because l don`t like you

983
01:22:24,389 --> 01:22:25,447
Hmmmm..

984
01:22:26,258 --> 01:22:29,785
You know, Even l don`t
like Malaika anymore

985
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:32,458
lt was all ok to begin with,

986
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:35,792
but now we want different
things from life.

987
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:42,337
We`ve drifted apart,
grown differently.

988
01:22:45,277 --> 01:22:46,801
You understand what l`m saying?

989
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:48,337
No

990
01:22:48,413 --> 01:22:50,142
And now l can`t even
break up with her,

991
01:22:51,016 --> 01:22:56,010
she`ll be heart-broken, she`ll
cry.. This you understand?

992
01:22:56,088 --> 01:22:57,146
Yes..

993
01:22:58,090 --> 01:23:03,357
Thank you, nice talking to you..
feel much better now

994
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:07,555
Sir, l`ve recovered the files

995
01:23:09,968 --> 01:23:12,903
Sharman, you`re a genius,
you can do anything..

996
01:23:13,038 --> 01:23:14,096
Thank you

997
01:23:14,439 --> 01:23:16,373
you want to marry Malaika ?

998
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:24,014
l made a big mistake

999
01:23:24,182 --> 01:23:25,240
What happened?

1000
01:23:25,317 --> 01:23:28,912
l spoke nicely to Ranbeer

1001
01:23:29,054 --> 01:23:32,854
Even l did the same..
he isn`t all that bad

1002
01:23:32,924 --> 01:23:37,122
Not at all, and like us,
he`s also got stuck

1003
01:23:37,195 --> 01:23:38,253
How?

1004
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:41,595
We`re stuck in his house,
and he`s stuck with Malaika

1005
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,327
She`s his girlfriend, you idiot

1006
01:23:44,403 --> 01:23:47,065
Then why did he say he
wants to leave her ?

1007
01:23:47,472 --> 01:23:48,530
Hmmm..

1008
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:51,075
All my blue Gems are over

1009
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:54,408
So what did Ranbeer say?

1010
01:23:54,479 --> 01:23:57,209
Ranbeer said if he breaks
up with her, she`ll cry

1011
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:01,878
hmm, check again

1012
01:24:03,955 --> 01:24:08,016
Wow so many blue Gems.. Magic ?

1013
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,894
Hey.. what`re you doing here ?

1014
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:17,901
You want to get rid of that barbie
doll ? what`s her name ? Malaika !

1015
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,028
Excuse me?

1016
01:24:20,105 --> 01:24:22,437
Excused.. You want to leave her ?

1017
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:30,908
But can`t, because she`ll cry? But
what if she herself leaves you ?

1018
01:24:34,386 --> 01:24:35,580
Can that happen ?

1019
01:24:36,521 --> 01:24:37,647
Do you want it to happen ?

1020
01:24:40,459 --> 01:24:41,517
Yes..

1021
01:24:41,993 --> 01:24:44,928
consider it done, now you just chill

1022
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:54,597
One.. two.. three

1023
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:58,074
OK, Thanks, Bye

1024
01:24:59,945 --> 01:25:02,209
As if l`ll go to that
Barbie dolls pool party

1025
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:03,406
What party?

1026
01:25:03,615 --> 01:25:06,413
Barbie doll has organized a
pool party for her birthday,

1027
01:25:06,485 --> 01:25:08,419
and invited all of us there..

1028
01:25:08,487 --> 01:25:13,356
She`s been planning for it
for the last 10 months,

1029
01:25:13,492 --> 01:25:18,953
the decorations, the
food, the invites

1030
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:20,964
So why can`t we go?

1031
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:24,229
Because then we would
have to be nice to her,

1032
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:25,427
and that`s something l can`t do

1033
01:25:25,504 --> 01:25:27,563
Then we`ll behave badly with her

1034
01:25:27,639 --> 01:25:29,163
Then she`ll get mad

1035
01:25:29,241 --> 01:25:30,299
So what?

1036
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:34,569
lf she gets mad, Ranbeer
will be angry with us

1037
01:25:34,646 --> 01:25:35,704
So what?

1038
01:25:35,981 --> 01:25:38,973
No, no.. who wants to mess with him

1039
01:25:39,317 --> 01:25:40,375
l do!

1040
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:43,244
lf Barbie doll is upset with him,

1041
01:25:43,321 --> 01:25:45,448
he`ll be upset with us,
that`s what we want ..

1042
01:25:45,524 --> 01:25:46,991
No, he wont be upset..

1043
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:48,582
He will be `really` upset

1044
01:25:49,661 --> 01:25:53,529
That`s why we all must
go to her pool party

1045
01:25:56,568 --> 01:26:06,569
[ Skipped item nr. 1045 ]

1046
01:26:10,015 --> 01:26:13,678
Each second takes an hour,
in these lazy moments

1047
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:17,745
Each hour takes a day,
in these lazy moments

1048
01:26:17,822 --> 01:26:21,417
They spin you around,
these lazy moments

1049
01:26:21,493 --> 01:26:24,690
Making you drunk, these lazy moments

1050
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:30,030
Let yourself go, and let
your fingers write..

1051
01:26:30,101 --> 01:26:32,695
..A poem of desire, on my body

1052
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:34,033
My heart has

1053
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:36,300
Skipped a beat

1054
01:26:36,708 --> 01:26:38,039
My breath is

1055
01:26:38,643 --> 01:26:41,237
So deep

1056
01:26:43,048 --> 01:26:48,509
in these lazy moments, lazy moments

1057
01:26:48,587 --> 01:26:56,119
Oh these lazy moments,
lazy moments

1058
01:26:56,194 --> 01:27:00,062
Each second takes an hour,
in these lazy moments

1059
01:27:00,131 --> 01:27:04,067
Each hour takes a day,
in these lazy moments

1060
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:07,536
They spin you around,
these lazy moments

1061
01:27:07,606 --> 01:27:10,803
Making you drunk, these lazy moments

1062
01:27:11,209 --> 01:27:19,082
ln these lazy moments, lazy moments

1063
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:27,148
Oh these lazy moments,

01:27:49,114 --> 01:27:52,709
Oh these lazy moments,

1065
01:27:52,851 --> 01:27:56,514
Oh these lazy moments,
lazy moments

1066
01:27:56,855 --> 01:28:01,121
Search my waist for a beauty spot

1067
01:28:01,259 --> 01:28:05,662
My lips will end your search

1068
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:12,530
Search my waist for a beauty spot

1069
01:28:12,671 --> 01:28:16,607
My lips will end your search

1070
01:28:16,675 --> 01:28:20,202
Find a drunken spot

1071
01:28:20,278 --> 01:28:24,339
Or maybe that`s in hair

1072
01:28:24,416 --> 01:28:25,815
a sensous

1073
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:28,148
Crime awaits

1074
01:28:28,219 --> 01:28:29,811
Sing away

1075
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:32,152
Your desires

1076
01:28:32,223 --> 01:28:39,823

Oh these lazy moments,

The air is drunk, try and hold it

The weather is intoxicating,
we will get drunk

1080
01:29:36,888 --> 01:29:41,222
The air is drunk, try and hold it

1081
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:45,228
The weather is intoxicating,
we will get drunk

1082
01:29:45,296 --> 01:29:48,891
Read my lazy intentions
with your eyes

1083
01:29:48,967 --> 01:29:52,630
Let slowly give in to our desires

1084
01:29:52,704 --> 01:29:54,501
Drunkeness

Oh these lazy moments,

Each hour takes a day,

Making you drunk, these lazy moments

1094

Let yourself go, and let

01:30:34,879 --> 01:30:38,679
A poem of desire,
on my inviting skin

1096
01:30:38,817 --> 01:30:40,011
My heart has

1097
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:42,277
Skipped a beat

1098
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:43,882
My breath is

1099
01:30:44,422 --> 01:30:46,549

Oh these lazy moments,

01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,473
Come on babe

You`re sorry?

l know you`ll feel really
bad to hear this

1114
01:32:26,391 --> 01:32:29,724
But l don`t think we can
be together any more

1115
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:35,930
l know you`ll hate me for this,
but what can l do ..

1116
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,061
What were you saying earlier
we cant be together

1117
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:44,939
l know it`s be a terrible shock for
you, but l`m just gonna say it

1118
01:32:45,743 --> 01:32:51,545
Ranbeer l`m breaking up with you

1119
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:53,742
you`re breaking up with me?

1120
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:55,683
And its your fault ?

1121
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:57,146
Your fault, eh?

1122
01:32:57,488 --> 01:33:00,423
Yeah, l can`t bear to
live with those kids

1123
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:02,425
l know neither can you..

1124
01:33:02,493 --> 01:33:05,428
..but that damn judge he`s
just ruined everything

1125
01:33:06,497 --> 01:33:11,434
Baby, l have to break up with
you. Will you forgive me?

1126
01:33:17,175 --> 01:33:20,633
Poor baby, you can`t
even say a word

1127
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:22,646
l`m really sorry

1128
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,045
Avantika, gimme some Gems.. thanks

1129
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:33,851
You may take a blue one too

1130
01:33:33,925 --> 01:33:36,450
So now you don`t like the blue ones?

1131
01:33:36,527 --> 01:33:38,188
No, no, l love them.

1132
01:33:38,463 --> 01:33:42,797
But since that day however many l
eat, they`re just not getting over,

1133
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:44,061
and they never will

1134
01:33:44,469 --> 01:33:45,527
Never?

1135
01:33:45,603 --> 01:33:46,661
Never ever

1136
01:33:47,472 --> 01:33:48,939
He`s come, Ranbeer`s come

1137
01:33:49,807 --> 01:33:51,001
Seems angry

1138
01:33:55,079 --> 01:33:56,808
Oye, the striker

1139
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:57,939
Thank you Pappu..

1140
01:33:58,616 --> 01:34:01,483
Hi,

1141
01:34:01,552 --> 01:34:02,610
Hi Ranbeer!

1142
01:34:04,555 --> 01:34:08,889
Ahh.. Ranbeer?

1143
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:10,618
Yes, Aditi?

1144
01:34:10,762 --> 01:34:14,220
Have you eaten? Or maybe
you did with Malaika

1145
01:34:15,099 --> 01:34:17,499
Well actually Malaika`s
broken up with me

1146
01:34:21,572 --> 01:34:24,507
Why`s he happy ? how
come he`s not upset ?

1147
01:34:24,575 --> 01:34:26,907
l`m so confused ! The
other day he was happy,

1148
01:34:26,978 --> 01:34:34,714
but he looked sad, today he`s sad,
and looks happy. God save him!

1149
01:34:34,786 --> 01:34:35,844
That`s what l was saying..

1150
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,514
Ranbeer wants me to
be his girlfriend..

1151
01:34:38,856 --> 01:34:42,587
Nobody listens to me..
lqbal, you tell them

1152
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:46,125

1155
01:34:59,544 --> 01:35:02,536
You knew that actually we
were helping Ranbeer?

1156
01:35:02,747 --> 01:35:03,941
No.. uh..

1157
01:35:04,682 --> 01:35:05,876
You knew, tell me

1158
01:35:07,552 --> 01:35:08,610
Yes

1159
01:35:08,686 --> 01:35:11,280
You`re not my brother.
Go to your Ranbeer!

1160
01:35:13,691 --> 01:35:17,752
Vashisht, Vashisht.. Vashisht

1161
01:35:17,829 --> 01:35:18,887
What?

1162
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:20,692
He fooled me

1163
01:35:20,765 --> 01:35:22,289
Don`t follow me

1164
01:35:26,037 --> 01:35:27,561
Hey lqbal what`s up

1165
01:35:27,638 --> 01:35:29,105
l don`t want to talk to you

1166
01:35:29,173 --> 01:35:30,572
What`ve l done?

01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:32,575

off if l don`t go to L.A.

1173
01:35:49,594 --> 01:35:51,061
Don`t worry, l`ll do something

1174
01:35:57,668 --> 01:35:58,726
Office

1175
01:35:58,836 --> 01:35:59,894
Not at all !

1176
01:36:08,946 --> 01:36:10,743
Hey this is a one-way street
- Hmm

1177
01:36:10,882 --> 01:36:13,680
But this is also the
way to Aditi`s school

1178
01:36:13,751 --> 01:36:15,616
Aditi came to me and said..

1179
01:36:15,686 --> 01:36:17,745
Didi, will you come to
my cooking contest ?

1180
01:36:17,822 --> 01:36:19,016
lt`s a mother-daughter special

1181
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:23,785
So l think it would be a
better idea if you went

1182
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:28,059
Hey watch it.. to a cooking
contest! Are you crazy ?

1183
01:36:28,132 --> 01:36:30,760
l won`t go.. watch the road please

1184
01:36:55,726 --> 01:36:56,818
Oh my God

1185
01:36:57,094 --> 01:36:58,891
Yeah, talking to me?

1186
01:36:58,963 --> 01:37:00,021
What?

1187
01:37:00,097 --> 01:37:01,724
You said something to me ?
- Nah !

1188
01:37:01,799 --> 01:37:05,200
Oh, bida ke sab ras le liyo re,

1189
01:37:05,269 --> 01:37:07,794
pinjarewali muniya!

1190
01:37:38,970 --> 01:37:40,062
Look straight

1191
01:37:40,137 --> 01:37:42,002
Not until you agree to go

1192
01:37:42,073 --> 01:37:43,768
Look ahead, you crazy woman

1193
01:37:43,841 --> 01:37:46,901
Yes or No?
- YEEESSS - YEEESSS

1194
01:37:46,978 --> 01:37:48,036
Yesss yesss yesss

1195
01:37:48,112 --> 01:37:49,170
Yesss yesss yesss

1196
01:38:00,791 --> 01:38:02,281
l`m here
- Ah excellent, Mr. Talwar

1197
01:38:05,930 --> 01:38:07,830
What`re you doing here?
Where`s Didi?

1198
01:38:08,266 --> 01:38:09,995
Your Didi sent me here

1199
01:38:10,234 --> 01:38:12,361
She did not, you came on your own

1200
01:38:17,742 --> 01:38:19,937
lt`s very important for you
to win this contest, right ?

1201
01:38:20,811 --> 01:38:23,041
Yes, l don`t like to lose

1202
01:38:24,949 --> 01:38:26,007
Neither do l

1203
01:38:27,852 --> 01:38:32,755
But when you go up to get your
trophy amidst all that applause,

1204
01:38:32,823 --> 01:38:38,887
see who`s clapping for you..
your own friends and classmates

1205
01:38:39,764 --> 01:38:41,755
Think how empty that
victory would be..

1206
01:38:41,832 --> 01:38:44,357
..if there was no
one to clap for you

1207
01:38:45,036 --> 01:38:49,268
So if someone else wins,
clap for them,

1208
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:51,304
as you would want them
to clap for you

1209
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:53,909
That way no one loses..

1210
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:56,874
..everyone`s part of the
victory in some way

1211
01:38:58,215 --> 01:39:00,149
But l still want to win

1212
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:02,952
Ya, l know what you mean

1213
01:39:03,788 --> 01:39:06,154
You all have been given
the same ingredients

1214
01:39:06,223 --> 01:39:09,784
You can make anything you want,
but within 30 minutes

1215
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:11,919
Your time starts now

1216
01:39:12,263 --> 01:39:14,026
Didi where are you?

1217
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,258
Pasta?

1218
01:39:17,935 --> 01:39:18,993
Pasta?

1219
01:39:19,136 --> 01:39:20,194
Pasta?

1220
01:39:20,805 --> 01:39:22,534
What should we do first?

1221
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:25,270
Let`s cut the vegetables

1222
01:39:49,834 --> 01:39:52,928
Hello, may l help you?

1223
01:39:53,003 --> 01:39:54,163
Aah! Mumma

1224
01:39:54,572 --> 01:39:58,906
We`ve run out of salt,
can l borrow you?

1225
01:40:07,051 --> 01:40:08,518
Mom, that`s sugar!

1226
01:40:18,329 --> 01:40:21,492
And your time ends now.
Please stop cooking

1227
01:40:22,032 --> 01:40:23,294
Burnt broccoli!

1228
01:40:23,467 --> 01:40:24,525
What`s this?

1229
01:40:24,602 --> 01:40:25,967
Egg shells!

1230
01:40:28,873 --> 01:40:32,309
And the winner is Aditi Wallia

1231
01:40:43,554 --> 01:40:48,287
Thank you

1232
01:40:59,270 --> 01:41:02,171
l`m so thrilled, l want to show
my trophy to everyone..

1233
01:41:02,306 --> 01:41:04,069
Vashisht will be so happy

1234
01:41:11,182 --> 01:41:14,515
Please help me.. l just can`t
solve this, l`ll fail

1235
01:41:15,653 --> 01:41:17,245
l`m sure you know this problem

1236
01:41:20,524 --> 01:41:23,186
Oh this.. l know this problem

1237
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:27,297
But why don`t you ask Ranbeer ?

1238
01:41:27,565 --> 01:41:30,033
Why should l ask him if
you know the problem ?

1239
01:41:30,234 --> 01:41:32,998
l know the problem, not the answer

1240
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:35,095
Didi!
- Go ask Ranbeer

1241
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:37,669
No, l`d rather fail

1242
01:41:37,942 --> 01:41:42,072
Go on ask him. lf he can`t solve
it, he`ll look stupid.

1243
01:41:42,379 --> 01:41:45,280
lf he can, you`ll pass

1244
01:42:06,036 --> 01:42:07,128
Chemistry?

1245
01:42:13,244 --> 01:42:15,075
lf you don`t want to help..

1246
01:42:15,279 --> 01:42:17,372
No.. no. l`ll help you

1247
01:42:17,581 --> 01:42:18,639
What`s the problem ?

1248
01:42:18,983 --> 01:42:21,110
What`s A + O2 equal to? And how?

1249
01:42:22,386 --> 01:42:25,583
What`s A + O2 equal to.. And how?

1250
01:42:27,625 --> 01:42:32,460
Well.. A is for apple,
plus O2..what`s O2?

1251
01:42:32,696 --> 01:42:36,393
Let it be You wouldn`t help me
even if you knew the answer

1252
01:42:36,467 --> 01:42:39,436
A + O2 = H2O + Co2

1253
01:42:40,004 --> 01:42:41,096
Huh?

1254
01:42:43,107 --> 01:42:45,667
A + O2 = H2O + Co2

1255
01:42:46,010 --> 01:42:47,602
And what`s 2H2 + O2?

1256
01:42:48,012 --> 01:42:50,640
2 H2 + O2 = 2H2O

1257
01:42:51,081 --> 01:42:53,515
How? How is A + O2 = H2O +Co2?

1258
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:56,018
Well where A is a carbon containing,

1259
01:42:56,086 --> 01:42:57,246
hydrogen containing molecule,

1260
01:42:57,321 --> 01:42:59,016
if A has more elements then they
will appear as products as well,

1261
01:42:59,089 --> 01:43:01,284
co-efficients will not usually be 1

1262
01:43:02,026 --> 01:43:04,119
Huh! ya right

1263
01:43:04,628 --> 01:43:06,459
Huh? l am Right?

1264
01:43:07,031 --> 01:43:10,194
You explained it so well, l
understood it for the first time

1265
01:43:10,768 --> 01:43:12,429
You understood?
- Yes

1266
01:43:12,736 --> 01:43:17,139
Good, at least you could
understand what l said

1267
01:43:19,176 --> 01:43:20,234
Pencil..

1268
01:43:20,311 --> 01:43:22,677
Ohh.. Sorry..

1269
01:43:24,248 --> 01:43:27,775
Vashisht, am l really that bad?

1270
01:43:29,053 --> 01:43:30,111
Yes

1271
01:43:31,221 --> 01:43:34,622
Even l don`t like you,
but l still helped you?

1272
01:43:35,125 --> 01:43:39,118
Sometimes we have to help others
even if we don`t like them,

1273
01:43:39,196 --> 01:43:40,424
because that`s the right thing to do

1274
01:43:41,565 --> 01:43:44,329
And Didi says we earn
plus points by doing so

1275
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:46,698
Yes, you get plus points, too

1276
01:43:47,071 --> 01:43:48,129
So?

1277
01:43:50,174 --> 01:43:53,075
Look, it`s very important for
me to go to Los Angeles,

1278
01:43:53,143 --> 01:43:56,203
for the take-over of a company,

1279
01:43:56,280 --> 01:44:02,310
but l can`t leave town without you
all, so will you come with me ?

1280
01:44:03,821 --> 01:44:06,813
You`ll suffer a big
loss if we don`t go ?

1281
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:08,450
Very big

1282
01:44:08,826 --> 01:44:11,158
OK then.. we won`t go

1283
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:17,167
Give him minus points, not me

1284
01:44:20,104 --> 01:44:22,664
You`ve applied to take the
kids to Los Angeles ?

1285
01:44:23,774 --> 01:44:24,832
Yes your honour

1286
01:44:27,645 --> 01:44:31,172
l`ll talk to the kids
and make my decision

1287
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:36,313
Yes your honour

1288
01:44:37,187 --> 01:44:38,586
Actually he`s quite nice

1289
01:44:39,123 --> 01:44:44,254
America? OK but please don`t
tell Vashisht l agreed

1290
01:44:44,595 --> 01:44:47,428
And he helped me win a trophy
at my cooking contest

1291
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:51,266
Hello.. l`ll tell you the
real truth about Ranbeer

1292
01:44:52,136 --> 01:44:53,535
Now he`ll ruin it

1293
01:44:55,406 --> 01:44:57,237
You know what he did with me?

1294
01:44:57,875 --> 01:44:59,775
He solved my chemistry problem

1295
01:45:02,146 --> 01:45:04,512
He also said he`ll take
us to the San Diego Zoo

1296
01:45:06,150 --> 01:45:08,675
He took part in the cooking
contest with Aditi

1297
01:45:09,553 --> 01:45:10,645
And made her win

1298
01:45:23,267 --> 01:45:27,328
OK you can take the
kids to Los Angeles

1299
01:45:28,172 --> 01:45:29,298
Thank you, your honor

1300
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:40,341
he said he wont take
us to San Diego Zoo

1301
01:45:46,190 --> 01:45:49,057
Why did he agree to go to
LA ? Something`s fishy

1302
01:45:49,259 --> 01:45:50,317
What? ..

1303
01:45:52,262 --> 01:45:56,289
Check that boy thoroughly, don`t
let him off because he`s a kid

1304
01:46:41,345 --> 01:46:43,313
Did you ever think

1305
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:46,349
You guys say so much without
actually talking

1306
01:46:46,483 --> 01:46:51,614
Did you ever think, why
we love the rains ?

1307
01:46:51,688 --> 01:46:53,815
Why we just start humming..

1308
01:46:54,858 --> 01:46:56,917
Shh.. go to sleep
- ..a tune for no reason

1309
01:46:56,994 --> 01:47:01,658
Why the waves on our feet
make us feel free

1310
01:47:01,732 --> 01:47:06,931
Why our restless feet take
us to new destinations

1311
01:47:07,004 --> 01:47:12,374
these are signs, that tell us

1312
01:47:12,442 --> 01:47:17,004
All that we need, is love

1313
01:47:27,391 --> 01:47:28,756
What`s she saying?

1314
01:47:29,693 --> 01:47:31,786
The car l booked isn`t available

1315
01:47:32,663 --> 01:47:34,392
Then which car will we go in?

1316
01:47:50,447 --> 01:47:54,042
Excuse me, sir. The presidential
suite is ready ..

1317
01:47:54,318 --> 01:47:56,650
here`s a key for you
and one for your wife

1318
01:47:57,054 --> 01:47:58,954
She`s not my wife, thank you!

1319
01:48:01,325 --> 01:48:03,520
Why did you say, she`s not my wife

1320
01:48:04,595 --> 01:48:05,653
Because you`re not

1321
01:48:05,729 --> 01:48:08,562
Don`t want to be either, but
why did you say it like that

1322
01:48:21,945 --> 01:48:23,003
Upset?

1323
01:48:23,547 --> 01:48:24,605
No

1324
01:48:25,415 --> 01:48:26,473
You seem to be

1325
01:48:31,355 --> 01:48:32,413
Ranbeer..

1326
01:48:32,489 --> 01:48:33,547
And Didi..

1327
01:48:33,624 --> 01:48:35,353
Didi..
- And Ranbeer

1328
01:48:35,425 --> 01:48:36,949
Love each other

1329
01:48:37,461 --> 01:48:38,519
Love each other

1330
01:48:38,795 --> 01:48:47,965
Why someone can make your
heart skip a beat

1331
01:48:49,006 --> 01:48:58,472
Why the scent of someone,
lingers on in your breath

1332
01:48:59,049 --> 01:49:04,453
Why do lips quiver, unable to say

1333
01:49:04,588 --> 01:49:08,820
That her hesitation, is her
expressing her need for love

1334
01:49:25,809 --> 01:49:28,778
Not me, lqbal, you ask

1335
01:49:28,912 --> 01:49:30,402
No, you ask

1336
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:35,508
Not me.. when Ranbeer helped me
win the trophy, he was so upset

1337
01:49:35,652 --> 01:49:37,415
No one listens to me
anyway so what ..

1338
01:49:37,487 --> 01:49:39,546
.. the point of me even
trying to say something

1339
01:49:39,756 --> 01:49:40,814
He`ll listen

1340
01:49:40,891 --> 01:49:42,620
lqbal, why don`t you ask ?

1341
01:49:43,427 --> 01:49:44,587
Ask what?

1342
01:49:45,662 --> 01:49:46,788
Uh.. nothing

1343
01:49:46,863 --> 01:49:48,831
They want to call Ranbeer, Brother

1344
01:49:49,433 --> 01:49:50,491
Brother?

1345
01:49:52,169 --> 01:49:57,106
lqbal, remove Ranbeer`s
sunglasses ..

1346
01:50:00,544 --> 01:50:01,602
Aditi!

1347
01:50:02,012 --> 01:50:03,639
Those two, not me

1348
01:50:05,115 --> 01:50:06,548
l just..

1349
01:50:08,752 --> 01:50:11,448
Vashisht, he`s so sweet,
and over the last week..

1350
01:50:11,521 --> 01:50:14,456
.. he`s been looking
after us so well

1351
01:50:14,524 --> 01:50:18,517
Even mummy papa taught us not
to call elders by their name

1352
01:50:18,862 --> 01:50:20,193
Ok, listen up guys.

1353
01:50:20,630 --> 01:50:23,190
Tomorrow l`m meeting Steve
at the golf course,

1354
01:50:23,533 --> 01:50:26,559
and he`s invited all of you as
kids are going to be there too.

1355
01:50:26,636 --> 01:50:30,470
So please, behave yourselves, it`s
a very important day for me,

1356
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:36,638
don`t screw it.. don`t
mess it up for me, OK ?

1357
01:50:41,084 --> 01:50:42,813
Ok Ranbeer .. Bhaiya

1358
01:50:45,756 --> 01:50:47,587
Have a good day Ranbeer Bhaiya

1359
01:50:49,559 --> 01:50:51,618
All the best Ranbeer Bhaiya

1360
01:51:24,528 --> 01:51:26,689
l cannot forget what he did to you.

1361
01:51:27,864 --> 01:51:30,958
l`ll do what the court
and the judge couldn`t,

1362
01:51:32,769 --> 01:51:34,669
tomorrow l`ll take revenge
from Ranbeer Talwar

1363
01:51:37,741 --> 01:51:40,039
Good game Steve. Lets close this now

1364
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:41,168
Let`s do it.

1365
01:51:41,244 --> 01:51:42,871
Hi
- Sat Sri Akaal

1366
01:51:43,213 --> 01:51:44,680
Hi.. it`s nice to meet you

1367
01:51:44,815 --> 01:51:45,907
Nice to meet you?

1368
01:51:45,982 --> 01:51:48,712
but we just met how do you know
whether it`ll be nice or not ?

1369
01:51:48,819 --> 01:51:51,879
Dad said l should take you
riding on our new Pony,

1370
01:51:52,289 --> 01:51:53,916
do you have horses in lndia?

1371
01:51:54,124 --> 01:51:55,955
No we go to school on elephants

1372
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:59,757
Our servants ride ponies, do
you have servants in America

1373
01:52:00,564 --> 01:52:03,897
What will l do with you kids?
l`ll go and play some golf

1374
01:52:06,636 --> 01:52:09,127
You got me on the last
round Ranbeer..

1375
01:52:09,306 --> 01:52:12,798
..but l think l`ve got you now.

1376
01:52:14,644 --> 01:52:21,743
Our final offer for your buy out of
our shares is $45.50 per share,

1377
01:52:22,252 --> 01:52:25,847
now that`s a little bit
higher than your quote

1378
01:52:25,922 --> 01:52:26,980
Done!

1379
01:52:27,257 --> 01:52:30,590
Great! l thought you`d try to
strike a harder bargain..

1380
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:32,685
let me call for some champagne..

1381
01:52:32,762 --> 01:52:36,664
Hang on, Steve. Could we just
check paragraph 212 again.

1382
01:53:17,073 --> 01:53:18,700
You have anything to say about this?

1383
01:53:19,176 --> 01:53:21,872
l don`t have anything to say.. You
go ahead and say what you want..

1384
01:53:24,648 --> 01:53:27,640
You ill mannered uncivilized
insolent brat..

1385
01:53:27,717 --> 01:53:29,912
How dare you do this to my kids-

1386
01:53:31,788 --> 01:53:33,255
go back to your goddamn
third world country

1387
01:53:33,323 --> 01:53:34,381
YOU..
- Steve!

1388
01:53:36,393 --> 01:53:38,224
How dare you talk to my
children like that?

1389
01:53:40,363 --> 01:53:42,888
This is gonna cost you Ranbeer

1390
01:53:44,401 --> 01:53:46,835
Cost me what? The deal?

1391
01:53:47,404 --> 01:53:49,167
`l` was the one buying
`you` remember,

1392
01:53:49,673 --> 01:53:51,265
you can take your contract
and shove it

1393
01:53:51,741 --> 01:53:55,074
Nobody, nobody talks
to my kids like that

1394
01:54:07,757 --> 01:54:09,418
l`ll talk to the Board of Directors,

1395
01:54:10,427 --> 01:54:12,793
lt was my decision, l take
full responsibility..

1396
01:54:13,163 --> 01:54:16,860
Don`t bother about what they say..
l`ll take care of it

1397
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:37,712
Didn`t you say that
the most difficult..

1398
01:54:37,787 --> 01:54:40,847
..thing is to forgive someone ?

1399
01:54:42,158 --> 01:54:46,094
Looks like lqbal, Aditi and
Avantika have forgiven Ranbeer

1400
01:54:47,063 --> 01:54:48,121
And you?

1401
01:54:49,966 --> 01:54:55,836
lf l forgive Ranbeer, won`t
l be betraying my parents?

1402
01:54:55,939 --> 01:54:59,466
Do you think he`s sincerely
repenting?

1403
01:54:59,976 --> 01:55:02,137
That he`s truly paying
penance for his deeds

1404
01:55:04,948 --> 01:55:06,916
A few days ago when lqbal was sad,

1405
01:55:07,751 --> 01:55:10,743
Ranbeer told him that your
parents adopted him ..

1406
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:13,880
.. even though they
had their own kids.

1407
01:55:15,759 --> 01:55:19,490
He said Families are not
created by birth alone,

1408
01:55:20,096 --> 01:55:21,825
love makes for stronger
bonds and families,

1409
01:55:24,501 --> 01:55:26,765
lts so strange that Ranbeer
has begun to think ..

1410
01:55:26,836 --> 01:55:29,168
.. just like your parents !

1411
01:55:57,867 --> 01:55:59,357
Ranbeer Bhaiya

1412
01:56:06,543 --> 01:56:07,908
What happened today..

1413
01:56:08,078 --> 01:56:09,375
We`re very sorry

1414
01:56:09,446 --> 01:56:11,277
Sorry Ranbeer Bhaiya

1415
01:56:14,184 --> 01:56:16,049
You shouldn`t be saying sorry..

1416
01:56:19,889 --> 01:56:21,914
l`m the one who needs
to say sorry to you..

1417
01:56:24,427 --> 01:56:28,557
But for what l`ve done, how can
l ask for your forgiveness

1418
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:32,458
for what l did to your parents..

1419
01:56:37,841 --> 01:56:43,939
l can never bring back
what you have lost..

1420
01:56:46,916 --> 01:56:53,151
but if l can give you all even
a little bit of happiness,

1421
01:56:55,191 --> 01:56:57,125
l`ll try my best..

1422
01:57:02,599 --> 01:57:05,966
l`m sorry, l`m sorry

1423
01:58:16,005 --> 01:58:18,473
How can they have tears and
a smile at the same time ?

1424
01:58:18,942 --> 01:58:23,072
How do they get a smile,
feel happy when they cry?

1425
01:58:23,279 --> 01:58:25,406
l`ll never know

1426
01:58:26,049 --> 01:58:27,539
l can`t even cry

1427
01:58:27,951 --> 01:58:29,179
Why do you want to cry?

1428
01:58:30,019 --> 01:58:33,682
Nothing makes me cry, that`s what
l feel like crying about,

1429
01:58:33,957 --> 01:58:36,016
but if l cant cry to begin with,

1430
01:58:36,159 --> 01:58:38,525
then how will l cry when
l feel like crying?

1431
01:58:38,628 --> 01:58:41,119
Shh.. you talk too much

1432
01:58:43,666 --> 01:58:46,066
You can never hide your feelings

1433
01:58:46,970 --> 01:58:50,497
Feelings? l don`t know about
feelings and love,

1434
01:58:50,974 --> 01:58:52,168
nor do l want to

1435
01:58:56,079 --> 01:58:57,603
When it hurts here..

1436
01:58:59,582 --> 01:59:01,106
Tears come out from here ..

1437
01:59:03,987 --> 01:59:05,454
And then it hurts here..

1438
01:59:07,357 --> 01:59:08,585
There`s no pain here..

1439
01:59:09,058 --> 01:59:10,650
So there`ll be no tears here..

1440
01:59:10,994 --> 01:59:12,393
so nothing will happen here too..

1441
01:59:29,078 --> 01:59:30,170
What happened?

1442
01:59:30,280 --> 01:59:31,406
Didi doesn`t like you?

1443
01:59:31,748 --> 01:59:37,152
No you fool, she loves Ranbeer
but she doesn`t know it

1444
01:59:37,620 --> 01:59:40,350
Then why doesn`t Ranbeer
go and tell her ?

1445
01:59:40,490 --> 01:59:42,014
That`s what he can`t do

1446
01:59:42,091 --> 01:59:43,183
What`s so difficult about that?

1447
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:46,692
Beats me, l would straight
away go and tell the girl

1448
01:59:46,763 --> 01:59:49,561
So why doesn`t Ranbeer
go and tell her ?

1449
01:59:50,033 --> 01:59:51,193
He`s scared

1450
01:59:51,434 --> 01:59:54,028
Hold on, can`t you see that
l`m sitting here..

1451
01:59:54,103 --> 01:59:56,162
you`ll are talking about
me as if l`m not here

1452
01:59:56,573 --> 01:59:57,631
So?

1453
01:59:57,774 --> 02:00:00,106
Ranbeer is not able to say
it to didi because..

1454
02:00:00,176 --> 02:00:06,137
Hey, hey, hey.. You think l`m
scared to tell her my feelings?

1455
02:00:07,050 --> 02:00:11,384
just watch how and in what style
l tell her what l feel..

1456
02:00:14,057 --> 02:00:17,584
Hang on, are you guys
instigating me?

1457
02:00:17,660 --> 02:00:18,718
Us?

1458
02:00:19,062 --> 02:00:21,656
No way
- what does instigating mean ?

1459
02:00:24,634 --> 02:00:26,226
instigating? l`ll tell you.

1460
02:00:39,482 --> 02:00:45,182
l was right! Geeta has succeeded
in making them into a family

1461
02:00:46,422 --> 02:00:52,156
Now that her job is over, she
should be come back here

1462
02:00:55,298 --> 02:00:58,096
Now she`s not required to
stay with them any longer,

1463
02:00:58,167 --> 02:01:03,662
what will she do there ? So
l`ll go and bring her back

Ranbeer and the kids

No Geeta, this is not your world.
You have to come back

This is a church. ls
Didi a Christian?

All Gods are one

1527
02:07:33,596 --> 02:07:37,555
Then why do they have different
names? We get confused.

1528
02:07:37,633 --> 02:07:38,691
l don`t understand..

1529

Wahe guru, Jesusji, all in one,
please give our Didi back to us

Now how do l reply to that?

Why` are you asking me?
you created this mess !

02:07:54,517 --> 02:07:58,578
Now you`re talking like them,
everything is always my fault !

1534
02:07:58,654 --> 02:07:59,951
Hmm..
- What, Hmm?

1535
02:08:00,156 --> 02:08:02,522
l must have collected
many plus points.

1536
02:08:02,591 --> 02:08:08,154
Take all my plus points and give
our Didi back to us. Please, God..

1537
02:08:09,231 --> 02:08:11,597
Add my plus points, too to hers

1538
02:08:12,034 --> 02:08:15,526
Didn`t you always say,
humans cry too much,

1539
02:08:15,604 --> 02:08:20,268
their lives and hearts are full
of pain, hurt and tears

1540
02:08:22,244 --> 02:08:26,613
Yes but in those tears
they find a joy,

1541
02:08:26,816 --> 02:08:29,717
in that pain they find love,

1542
02:08:33,923 --> 02:08:35,891
From my childhood to now,

1543
02:08:37,626 --> 02:08:43,690
you`ve always taken away everyone
who l`ve loved or who loved me,

1544
02:08:48,070 --> 02:08:50,630
l have been falling in love
with that crazy woman

1545
02:08:53,576 --> 02:08:59,674
You`ve done it once before to them,
you`re doing it again now.

1546
02:09:04,286 --> 02:09:08,689
l never said anything, l learnt
to live with that pain.

1547
02:09:13,329 --> 02:09:15,661
Don`t make my children like me.

1548
02:09:18,767 --> 02:09:20,735
Please don`t do that
to my children now.

1549
02:09:22,204 --> 02:09:23,831
Don`t make them suffer again

1550
02:09:29,011 --> 02:09:30,069
lf you`re taking her away
because of my love..

1551
02:09:30,146 --> 02:09:31,204
..then don`t give me my love,

1552
02:09:32,715 --> 02:09:36,947
but don`t take the love away from
these children`s lives, please.

1553
02:09:38,354 --> 02:09:40,049
l can`t see them cry,

1554
02:09:46,629 --> 02:09:47,823
please don`t make them cry anymore,

1555
02:10:04,713 --> 02:10:08,877
You`ve.. made me.. a human?

1556
02:10:08,951 --> 02:10:13,820
This is because of your Ranbeer and
your kids.. and their `love`.

l`m flirting with you?

1567
02:11:24,026 --> 02:11:26,824
You`re actually flirting
and not being suck up..
