1
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:51,351
I am going to disappear after tonight.

2
00:04:53,303 --> 00:04:55,528
I have burnt all the proofs of my identity.

3
00:04:56,783 --> 00:04:58,848
I hope no one will be able to trace me.

4
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,040
But before I leave,
I want to reveal something.

5
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:12,200
A kind of reality you probably
haven't seen or heard before.

6
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:18,529
A sin, that makes me hate myself.

7
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:28,007
Something so disgusting,
that once I started...

8
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:32,598
...I kept committing it for 3 long years.

9
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:05,649
Your wife Sindoora Singh's
statement claims that...

10
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:07,951
...you've physically assaulted her.

11
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,248
Sir, Look at this.

12
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:15,459
Just assume this is a glass...
A wine glass.

13
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:16,928
I am sure you have seen it before.

14
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:20,126
You've been charged under section 307...

15
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:21,768
...Half murder.

16
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:25,084
There is a fly stuck inside
this wine glass... Poor fly...

17
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:27,528
...Wondering how to get out.

18
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:31,086
You are the one stuck here Raghuram Singh.

19
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:32,727
You will be going behind
bars for a long time.

20
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,328
Now, the challenge for you is...

21
00:06:34,688 --> 00:06:37,328
...to move only two sides of the glass...

22
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:39,568
...and get this fly out
without touching it.

23
00:06:39,662 --> 00:06:42,662
And remember,
it should again form the shape of a glass.

24
00:06:42,848 --> 00:06:46,448
The medical report confirms that
your wife suffered severe head injury.

25
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:48,038
She could have died.

26
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,398
She should have died!!
It would've been such a relief.

27
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:56,669
She deserves to be punished for her deeds.

28
00:06:57,528 --> 00:07:00,661
Anyways,
you will be glad to know that your wife...

29
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:02,706
...has been discharged from the hospital.

30
00:07:05,528 --> 00:07:06,688
So, can I go home?

31
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:10,516
I am just your lawyer, not a judge.

32
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:13,519
Mr. Verma, please do something.

33
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:15,528
Get me out of here.

34
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:16,728
Please.

35
00:07:17,544 --> 00:07:20,984
I can't do much right now.
Let me try after Diwali.

36
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:25,128
Try!!! It seems as if you have
surrendered without a fight.

37
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:28,572
Why don't you believe me,
that woman is trying to frame me.

38
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:31,552
She is falsely accusing
me of attempting on her life.

39
00:07:31,688 --> 00:07:34,288
She has forgotten that I
loved her more than myself.

40
00:07:34,477 --> 00:07:35,026
Love!!

41
00:07:36,691 --> 00:07:38,333
People in love don't get angry.

42
00:07:38,368 --> 00:07:40,388
Ohh! Please, don't lecture me on love.

43
00:07:41,088 --> 00:07:42,768
It is natural to get angry
with people we love.

44
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:43,666
So you did get angry?

45
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:45,778
Yes I was angry. Who wouldn't be?

46
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:50,139
There is nothing called
love in my wife's dictionary.

47
00:07:50,322 --> 00:07:51,908
Love means something else to her.

48
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:53,095
What do you mean?

49
00:07:57,255 --> 00:07:58,749
My wife was cheating on me.

50
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:01,376
I had become an obstacle.

51
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:04,388
So she decided to get me out of her way.

52
00:08:05,374 --> 00:08:07,007
On the day of the incident...

53
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:08,488
...There was someone
hiding in the storage room.

54
00:08:08,528 --> 00:08:10,231
He attacked me with a knife.

55
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:12,138
Look at this!

56
00:08:13,248 --> 00:08:14,288
Who was hiding?

57
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,527
Why don't you ask my wife?

58
00:08:16,568 --> 00:08:17,448
Don't shout.

59
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:20,541
As your lawyer, I am asking you.
Who was he?

60
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:22,267
It was dark. I couldn't see his face.

61
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:25,863
But I am sure that she
was trying to hide him.

62
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:33,863
She would often invite
other men in my absence.

63
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:35,907
Raghuram Singh!!

64
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:38,488
This could be held against you.

65
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:42,614
You had a clear motive
to get angry and violent.

66
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:45,099
The prosecutor will
prove you guilty in no time.

67
00:08:45,128 --> 00:08:48,455
Will you be hatching eggs in the courtroom?

68
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:52,168
I have explained everything in
my diary about my wife's character.

69
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:53,307
You should read it.

70
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:57,907
Moreover, I have told everything
to Inspector Shrivastava.

71
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:00,467
I don't want to say anything further.

72
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:09,149
You should leave now. And let me
focus on getting the fly out of the glass.

73
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:43,901
Is Sindoora Raghuram Singh home?

74
00:09:46,815 --> 00:09:48,786
Hello, is Sindoora Singh home?

75
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:57,107
Look at this. Is Madam home?

76
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,188
Mrs. Sindoora Raghuram Singh!

77
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:55,148
I am Manas Verma.
Your husband Raghuram Singh's lawyer.

78
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:56,946
What do you want?

79
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:59,255
I want to ask you few
questions regarding the case.

80
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:01,298
I don't want to talk anything about it.

81
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:04,616
Madam, I need only 5 minutes of your time.

82
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:07,186
I don't want to talk to
my husband's lawyer.

83
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:10,415
I have told everything
to Inspector Shrivastava.

84
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,375
Please, Madam I just need 5 minutes...
I won't take much time...

85
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:21,236
Didn't you hear me? I don't want
to talk to my husband's lawyer.

86
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:22,718
Just leave.

87
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:01,048
'MANAS VERMA'

88
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:10,148
'Stay away from Sindoora Singh.
This is not an advise but a warning'

89
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:19,055
'POLICE STATION'
'SARASWATI NAGAR'

90
00:12:19,648 --> 00:12:21,149
It looks like
a Sindoora's well-wisher...

91
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:24,187
...who doesn't want you to meet her.

92
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:28,061
Anyways, you don't have to worry,
I will lodge a complaint.

93
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:31,497
Okay!
Any update on that cable guy about whom...

94
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:33,287
...Sindoora had mentioned in her statement?

95
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:36,408
No. We could only manage to get his photo.

96
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:40,496
He seems to be absconding.

97
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:44,055
Interestingly,
Raghuram Singh never mentioned...

98
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,794
...about any cable guy in his statement.

99
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:50,521
According to him, the one who attacked
him with a knife was someone else.

100
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,509
That's why it's important to catch him.

101
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:55,967
Have you read Raghuram Singh's diary?

102
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:57,185
No!

103
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:59,741
If you read it, you'll be quite clear.

104
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:02,792
By the way, I have noticed something.

105
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:05,966
The wound on Sindoora's forehead...

106
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:08,428
...doesn't seem as serious
as she's claiming it to be.

107
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:11,752
Honestly, I suspect Sindoora Singh.

108
00:13:12,678 --> 00:13:17,039
During interrogation at the hospital,
she would give me strange looks.

109
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:18,427
I didn't get you.

110
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:24,295
I felt she was trying to influence me.

111
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:25,633
Didn't you notice that?

112
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:34,129
Anyways, this letter indicates that
this case is not as simple as it seems.

113
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,507
Who is it?

114
00:14:50,782 --> 00:14:51,549
Who is it?

115
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:54,276
Sindoora!

116
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,468
Who is it?

117
00:15:23,182 --> 00:15:23,982
Sindoora.

118
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:55,090
You are following me despite being warned.

119
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:58,330
I just want to talk to you.

120
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:00,250
But I don't want to talk to you.

121
00:19:00,554 --> 00:19:01,994
Whom are you meeting here?

122
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:03,987
That's none of your business.

123
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:06,238
You are not my lawyer.

124
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:07,843
Just leave.

125
00:19:08,328 --> 00:19:13,488
Your head injury!!
You were wearing a bandage yesterday.

126
00:19:13,872 --> 00:19:15,312
I... I forgot.

127
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:16,728
What did you forget?

128
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:19,218
Mr. Manas Verma, don't try
to make something out of nothing.

129
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:25,247
Because, there is someone who is writing
this script and you are just a puppet.

130
00:19:25,488 --> 00:19:28,178
Who is it?
Why don't you tell me clearly?

131
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,229
You'll understand everything
if you stop seeing things as a lawyer.

132
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:33,789
My husband has all the answers.

133
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:37,371
Ask him and stop following me.

134
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,411
Hello.

135
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:52,872
Stay away from that woman.

136
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:54,909
She's very manipulative.

137
00:19:55,288 --> 00:20:00,004
She's ignoring you so that
you get attracted towards her.

138
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,400
That's her pattern.

139
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:04,968
Hello!

140
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,026
Hello!

141
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,168
Hello!

142
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:20,068
Are your trying to scare me off?

143
00:20:21,248 --> 00:20:22,898
Are you the one sending me
threatening letters?

144
00:20:24,248 --> 00:20:25,949
Don't you dare forget
that I am your lawyer.

145
00:20:26,713 --> 00:20:28,509
And only I can get you out of this place.

146
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:35,888
Wow!! Now even you have started
to weave stories like my wife.

147
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:37,988
Stop fooling around.

148
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:40,888
I heard your voice on the phone.

149
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:43,971
Are you mad?
Who made you a lawyer?

150
00:20:44,128 --> 00:20:46,787
How can I call you?
How can I get a phone here?

151
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,790
This is all Sindoora's plan.

152
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,015
Just shut up!

153
00:20:53,088 --> 00:20:56,428
You are stopping me from knowing the truth.

154
00:20:57,585 --> 00:21:04,065
Mr. Verma, I think you have
bribed your way to become a lawyer.

155
00:21:05,408 --> 00:21:07,768
Understand her game.

156
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:11,858
If I am out on bail,
she would lose her freedom.

157
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,848
That's why she's using you against me.

158
00:21:15,144 --> 00:21:17,788
She is killing two birds with one stone.

159
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,813
What do you mean?

160
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:31,143
My wife has a weird fetish.

161
00:21:37,008 --> 00:21:37,748
Fetish!

162
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:40,069
What fetish?

163
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:42,639
Ahhhhh!!!!

164
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,375
Now that got you excited!

165
00:21:48,617 --> 00:21:51,987
Raghuram Singh,
don't waste my time and speak up.

166
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:55,827
If you have read my diary...

167
00:21:57,528 --> 00:22:04,008
...then you must have figured
out that my wife is abnormal.

168
00:22:04,611 --> 00:22:08,611
And, her obsession is of a different scale.

169
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:10,810
What obsession?

170
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:13,588
The obsession to control men...

171
00:22:15,187 --> 00:22:17,587
She gets a high in seducing men.

172
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:19,468
She gets a kick out of that.

173
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:25,090
But you are stubborn, and she
knows that you are not an easy catch.

174
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:28,611
That's why she's trying to
act innocent in front of you.

175
00:22:28,731 --> 00:22:33,531
Pretending to be weak so that
you get emotionally attached to her.

176
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:38,290
And then, use you against me.

177
00:22:39,528 --> 00:22:41,728
Bullshit. Bullshit.

178
00:22:41,768 --> 00:22:43,348
This isn't bullshit. It's the truth.

179
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,908
What you are seeing, isn't the truth.

180
00:22:46,808 --> 00:22:49,751
Truth is disgusting.

181
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:52,308
Extremely disgusting.

182
00:22:52,968 --> 00:22:53,728
Is it?

183
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,148
And, what's the truth?

184
00:22:55,448 --> 00:22:56,669
If you want the truth...

185
00:22:57,688 --> 00:23:00,268
...then see things from my
perspective and not from a lawyers.

186
00:23:00,968 --> 00:23:03,687
My wife is the one who
is writing this story...

187
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:06,418
...and we both are just puppets.

188
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:12,029
You should go to that house once,
and see what happens there.

189
00:23:13,093 --> 00:23:17,228
My wife is a maniac...

190
00:23:19,168 --> 00:23:20,306
...a nymphomaniac.

191
00:23:21,128 --> 00:23:25,149
And you are her next target.

192
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:34,823
You shouldn't have gone upstairs.

193
00:28:35,504 --> 00:28:36,865
This is Madness...

194
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,321
...Utter madness.

195
00:28:39,072 --> 00:28:40,792
You shouldn't have seen all that.

196
00:28:41,968 --> 00:28:45,288
It would be better for you if
you keep your mouth shut...

197
00:28:45,672 --> 00:28:47,992
...and forget what you've seen upstairs.

198
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:50,592
I won't let this happen.

199
00:28:50,817 --> 00:28:51,817
What will you do?

200
00:28:52,223 --> 00:28:53,864
I will go to the police.

201
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:56,418
Alright! Go ahead!

202
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,668
Do it.

203
00:28:59,288 --> 00:29:05,402
But, you will never be able to prove
what happens behind closed doors.

204
00:29:21,221 --> 00:29:22,119
Mrs. Sindoora.

205
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:25,408
Mrs. Sindoora, I know you can hear me.

206
00:29:26,968 --> 00:29:27,956
Please open the door.

207
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,376
Mrs. Sindoora, please open the door.
Please.

208
00:29:41,288 --> 00:29:42,472
'Your head injury!!'

209
00:29:43,328 --> 00:29:44,541
'You were wearing a bandage yesterday.'

210
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:47,587
Make it quick.

211
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:54,227
Your head injury!!
The last time I met you, it wasn't there.

212
00:29:55,843 --> 00:29:57,827
Have you lost it!

213
00:29:58,408 --> 00:30:01,517
Memory loss at this age is
not good for your profession.

214
00:30:01,568 --> 00:30:06,288
No. I clearly remember,
there was no wound the last time I met you.

215
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:10,304
If you think I am lying, then what is this?
Tell me.

216
00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:16,046
You think a lot.

217
00:30:17,368 --> 00:30:20,786
Can you tell me what
exactly happened that day?

218
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,909
Mrs. Sindoora, Can you please tell
me what exactly happened that day.

219
00:30:28,168 --> 00:30:30,508
I have told everything to the Police.

220
00:30:31,008 --> 00:30:32,818
Please don't keep questioning
me again and again.

221
00:30:33,195 --> 00:30:36,786
According to your husband, there
was someone hiding in the storage room.

222
00:30:37,515 --> 00:30:40,715
My husband is telling you false stories.

223
00:30:41,248 --> 00:30:42,888
You can believe him if you want to.

224
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:49,797
Honestly, despite being my client,
I don't trust Raghuram Singh.

225
00:30:50,117 --> 00:30:53,477
But, I also don't have
any reason to trust you.

226
00:30:55,008 --> 00:30:57,562
Mr. Verma, I had mentioned earlier...

227
00:30:59,048 --> 00:31:01,875
...that you will never understand
if you see it as a lawyer.

228
00:31:01,997 --> 00:31:02,941
What do you mean?

229
00:31:04,157 --> 00:31:07,028
Why don't you meet me at leisure...

230
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,836
...I can explain you better.

231
00:31:16,368 --> 00:31:18,847
Why haven't you appointed
a lawyer for yourself?

232
00:31:19,088 --> 00:31:20,228
I didn't think it was necessary.

233
00:31:21,248 --> 00:31:23,311
I believe the truth will be out on its own.

234
00:31:25,088 --> 00:31:26,628
But, let me clear one thing.

235
00:31:28,356 --> 00:31:31,506
If my husband is out on bail,
he will kill me.

236
00:31:32,528 --> 00:31:34,832
And you shall be responsible.

237
00:32:15,448 --> 00:32:19,447
Don't bother that old man
in our household matters.

238
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:31,809
'Our marriage was a simple affair.'

239
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,338
'I was considering myself
fortunate to get a wife like Sindoora.'

240
00:32:37,653 --> 00:32:42,453
'On our first night, I tried my
best to make her feel comfortable.'

241
00:32:42,654 --> 00:32:45,551
'But Sindoora, just kept quiet.'

242
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,559
'It's been a month since our marriage.'

243
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,095
'Today, for the first time
she broke her silence...'

244
00:32:57,734 --> 00:33:02,774
'...and told me that she had relationships
with many men before marriage.'

245
00:33:03,495 --> 00:33:06,055
'I was stunned.'

246
00:33:11,368 --> 00:33:13,888
'Last night, I pretended to be asleep.'

247
00:33:13,943 --> 00:33:18,153
'I found out that Sindoora was
talking to someone on the phone.'

248
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,667
'She was tongue-tied when I enquired.'

249
00:33:22,862 --> 00:33:27,143
'Today, I found some cigarette buds
and could smell fragrance of a perfume.'

250
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,029
'Sindoora's suspicious behavior proved...'

251
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,240
'...that someone had
come home in my absence.'

252
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,547
'Now, I am sure that Sindoora
is cheating on me.'

253
00:33:39,688 --> 00:33:41,627
'Her silence is frightening.'

254
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:44,455
'I can't spend another moment with her.'

255
00:33:45,328 --> 00:33:51,090
'Sometimes, I feel either
I should end my life or kill her.'

256
00:34:57,928 --> 00:35:00,362
I don't understand whose side you are on?

257
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:03,861
The Legislator has
sent you to fight for me...

258
00:35:03,888 --> 00:35:05,848
...instead you are screwing with me.

259
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:09,167
Is she sleeping with you?

260
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,069
You are sick.

261
00:35:12,982 --> 00:35:14,407
This is her forte.

262
00:35:14,888 --> 00:35:18,877
Just a couple of meetings,
and you have started to defend her.

263
00:35:20,424 --> 00:35:23,025
What did she do to turn you against me?

264
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:26,353
Stop this nonsense and tell
me what happened that day.

265
00:35:27,143 --> 00:35:28,798
If you don't speak up today...

266
00:35:29,263 --> 00:35:32,036
...I will withdraw from this case...
You can go to hell.

267
00:35:33,688 --> 00:35:35,508
If you want the truth, then listen...

268
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:38,919
It was a bad day for me.

269
00:35:41,383 --> 00:35:43,463
'Due to a sudden
truck operator's strike...'

270
00:35:43,504 --> 00:35:45,471
'...we couldn't receive
cement from the supplier.'

271
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:50,488
'Then a laborer got injured...'

272
00:35:50,693 --> 00:35:53,153
'...and the work at the
site came to a standstill.'

273
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:05,543
'Incidentally,
it was Sindoora's birthday on that day.'

274
00:36:05,768 --> 00:36:08,568
'Despite our bitter relationship.'

275
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:11,696
'I decided to buy a bouquet for her.'

276
00:36:11,966 --> 00:36:16,428
'But little did I know that it was just
the beginning of that unfortunate day.'

277
00:36:19,022 --> 00:36:23,107
'When I reached home I saw
some petals lying at my doorsteps.'

278
00:36:24,103 --> 00:36:25,382
'I was surprised.'

279
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,755
'I rang the doorbell.'

280
00:36:27,662 --> 00:36:28,870
'But there was no answer.'

281
00:36:29,383 --> 00:36:32,576
'I rang the doorbell
again but still no answer.'

282
00:36:33,048 --> 00:36:35,848
'Despite trying several times
when there was no response...'

283
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:37,746
'...I sensed there was something wrong.'

284
00:36:38,008 --> 00:36:41,075
'Then I used my keys, and...'

285
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:42,852
'Sindoora.'

286
00:37:46,423 --> 00:37:47,143
'What happened?'

287
00:37:48,128 --> 00:37:50,728
'I have been ringing the doorbell.
Why didn't you open the door?'

288
00:37:50,975 --> 00:37:54,655
'You have your keys, right?'

289
00:37:57,128 --> 00:38:01,688
'What's all this?
Why do you keep watching such dirty films?'

290
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:04,787
'It's not necessary what you
find dirty even others should.'

291
00:38:05,535 --> 00:38:07,175
'And who got you this bouquet?'

292
00:38:07,264 --> 00:38:07,862
'Why do you care?'

293
00:38:10,982 --> 00:38:11,741
'Who's upstairs?'

294
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:16,208
'Who is hiding there?'

295
00:38:18,168 --> 00:38:19,348
'I am asking you, who's upstairs?'

296
00:38:20,063 --> 00:38:20,872
'Stop!!'

297
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:22,562
'Ohh!'

298
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:27,367
'So you have called someone in my absence.'

299
00:38:28,196 --> 00:38:30,109
'Stop blabbering the same
thing again and again.'

300
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:33,639
'Anyways, you were supposed
to come in the evening.'

301
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:37,984
'If you don't like me,
why don't you leave me?'

302
00:38:39,888 --> 00:38:42,488
'Leave me and do whatever you want to do.'

303
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:43,748
'What's the problem?'

304
00:38:45,463 --> 00:38:48,632
'Let me see whom do
you meet in my absence!'

305
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:52,146
'You won't like it.'

306
00:38:54,928 --> 00:38:55,888
'Move.'

307
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:16,992
'Who's there?'

308
00:39:27,848 --> 00:39:28,428
'Who's there?'

309
00:39:43,268 --> 00:39:44,067
'Who's there?'

310
00:39:45,588 --> 00:39:46,492
'Who's there?'

311
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:06,804
'No! No! Leave me!'

312
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:11,568
'Help me!! Help me!! Help me!!'

313
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,888
'My wife wants to kill me.'

314
00:40:13,928 --> 00:40:16,008
'You have planned to kill me.'

315
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,868
'Help me!!'

316
00:40:17,608 --> 00:40:20,466
'Help me!! Any one there!'

317
00:40:23,314 --> 00:40:24,306
'Any one there!'

318
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:05,287
I barely pushed Sindoora.

319
00:41:07,088 --> 00:41:08,685
She banged her head against the wall...

320
00:41:08,726 --> 00:41:10,628
...and charged me with attempt to murder.

321
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,226
She is taking advantage of being a woman.

322
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,910
There's a lot hidden inside her.

323
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:22,788
I could never understand her.

324
00:41:25,327 --> 00:41:27,388
Looks like you are her next target.

325
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:34,048
She is going to do
something terrible to you.

326
00:41:35,808 --> 00:41:37,108
Stay away from her.

327
00:41:38,806 --> 00:41:39,668
Stay away.

328
00:43:23,248 --> 00:43:25,068
What you are seeing, isn't the truth.

329
00:43:25,408 --> 00:43:27,727
Truth is disgusting.

330
00:43:27,878 --> 00:43:30,038
So according to you she is lying?

331
00:43:30,095 --> 00:43:32,695
100% she's lying. She's a habitual liar.

332
00:43:33,245 --> 00:43:35,966
Is it possible that Sindoora Singh is
taking undue advantage of being a woman.

333
00:43:36,007 --> 00:43:38,337
Honestly, I suspect Sindoora Singh.

334
00:43:40,008 --> 00:43:41,068
Your head injury!!

335
00:43:41,648 --> 00:43:42,868
You were wearing a bandage yesterday.

336
00:43:44,728 --> 00:43:47,368
My wife has a strange obsession.

337
00:43:47,848 --> 00:43:49,888
The obsession to control men...

338
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:52,646
She likes to seduce men.

339
00:43:52,768 --> 00:43:54,607
She gets a kick out of that.

340
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,615
Why don't you meet me at leisure!

341
00:43:57,814 --> 00:43:59,667
I can explain you better.

342
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:04,407
If you have read my diary...

343
00:44:05,688 --> 00:44:11,688
...then you must have figured
out that my wife is abnormal.

344
00:44:12,048 --> 00:44:15,127
She will do something terrible to you.

345
00:44:15,566 --> 00:44:17,846
This threatening letter indicates...

346
00:44:17,887 --> 00:44:19,888
...that this case is not
as simple as it seems.

347
00:44:20,054 --> 00:44:22,706
You'll understand everything if
you stop seeing things as a lawyer.

348
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:25,711
Because, there's someone,
who's making you dance to his tunes.

349
00:44:26,758 --> 00:44:27,718
Hello! Hello!

350
00:44:29,568 --> 00:44:30,765
My wife is...

351
00:44:32,448 --> 00:44:33,581
...a maniac.

352
00:44:35,608 --> 00:44:36,792
A nymphomaniac.

353
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:41,562
And you are her next target.

354
00:45:30,168 --> 00:45:31,367
- Why!!
- Mrs. Sindoora!

355
00:45:31,408 --> 00:45:33,408
- Why did you do this?
- Mrs. Sindoora!

356
00:45:33,448 --> 00:45:35,687
- Why did you do this?
- Mrs. Sindoora what are you doing?

357
00:45:35,728 --> 00:45:37,048
Mrs. Sindoora, calm down!

358
00:45:37,096 --> 00:45:37,958
Calm down!

359
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:47,129
So, finally he has managed
to put the entire blame on me.

360
00:45:47,808 --> 00:45:50,109
He has proved me guilty
and bailed himself out.

361
00:45:51,877 --> 00:45:54,588
He knows very well how to play mind games.

362
00:45:57,168 --> 00:45:59,303
My life is also being
controlled by my husband.

363
00:45:59,717 --> 00:46:00,583
I didn't get you.

364
00:46:03,608 --> 00:46:05,507
You will never understand, Mr. Verma.

365
00:46:06,325 --> 00:46:09,508
You are just seeing what
my husband wants you to see.

366
00:46:11,488 --> 00:46:14,049
And you are doing exactly what
my husband wants you to do.

367
00:46:14,103 --> 00:46:15,708
I just want to know the truth.

368
00:46:22,184 --> 00:46:23,648
I was not feeling too well that day.

369
00:46:25,608 --> 00:46:27,348
I had a severe headache.

370
00:46:29,528 --> 00:46:31,788
When I couldn't sleep
despite trying for long...

371
00:46:32,448 --> 00:46:36,189
I decided to watch a movie.

372
00:46:37,288 --> 00:46:39,666
'I picked up a DVD and
inserted it into the DVD player.'

373
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:41,585
'Just then the doorbell rang.'

374
00:46:46,544 --> 00:46:47,943
'Happy Birthday Madam.'

375
00:46:49,464 --> 00:46:50,504
'How do you know?'

376
00:46:50,928 --> 00:46:53,288
'Madam, we maintain a database
of all our customers.'

377
00:46:53,368 --> 00:46:55,288
'This bouquet is on behalf of our company.'

378
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:56,788
'Really!! Thank you.'

379
00:46:57,048 --> 00:46:59,868
'Madam, your payment for
cable connection is pending.'

380
00:47:00,848 --> 00:47:01,473
'Okay.'

381
00:47:36,248 --> 00:47:37,181
'Take this.'

382
00:47:38,136 --> 00:47:38,952
'Thank you Madam.'

383
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,759
'Madam! Are you alright?'

384
00:47:43,542 --> 00:47:46,342
'Yes! Feeling a bit dizzy since morning.'

385
00:47:46,383 --> 00:47:48,183
'Can I get you some medicines?'

386
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,868
'No no, that's alright.
Give me the receipt.'

387
00:47:51,383 --> 00:47:52,178
'Take this.'

388
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:53,447
'Thank you Madam.'

389
00:47:53,488 --> 00:47:57,007
'Madam!! You really seem unwell.'

390
00:47:57,968 --> 00:47:59,487
'Let me help you to your room.'

391
00:47:59,528 --> 00:48:02,757
- '- No. I can manage.
- Let me help you.'

392
00:48:03,554 --> 00:48:04,343
'Come.'

393
00:48:05,304 --> 00:48:07,904
'Carefully. Come.'

394
00:48:08,392 --> 00:48:09,832
'I am fine.'

395
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,823
'No no Madam, Let me
help you to your room.'

396
00:48:11,864 --> 00:48:13,623
'I am fine. You just leave.'

397
00:48:14,128 --> 00:48:17,488
- '- Madam, let me help you to your room.
- I am fine. You please leave.'

398
00:48:24,543 --> 00:48:27,024
'Wow! You seem to have
an unusual taste in movies.'

399
00:48:27,361 --> 00:48:29,475
'Mind your language. And get out of here.'

400
00:48:31,184 --> 00:48:32,744
'I can't step back.'

401
00:48:33,088 --> 00:48:34,487
'It's too late now.'

402
00:48:34,664 --> 00:48:38,272
'Listen. If my husband
comes to know he will kill you.'

403
00:48:38,429 --> 00:48:39,203
'Really?'

404
00:48:39,991 --> 00:48:42,790
'Then, he will also come to know what
kind of movies you watch in his absence.'

405
00:48:42,888 --> 00:48:44,623
'I will scream if you
don't leave right now.'

406
00:48:44,664 --> 00:48:45,944
'Please scream.'

407
00:48:46,088 --> 00:48:48,223
'But if you keep quiet no one will know.'

408
00:48:48,248 --> 00:48:49,568
'What are you doing?'

409
00:48:57,906 --> 00:48:59,936
'Madam. Madam.'

410
00:49:09,023 --> 00:49:09,938
'It's good.'

411
00:49:11,624 --> 00:49:12,749
'I like the darkness.'

412
00:49:13,809 --> 00:49:17,703
'Now you won't feel shy in front of me.'

413
00:49:19,664 --> 00:49:21,783
'Should we play hide and seek?'

414
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:29,834
"Let's play hide and seek...
Let's play hide and seek."

415
00:49:31,623 --> 00:49:32,593
'Caught you!!!'

416
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:56,978
'Sindoora.'

417
00:49:58,007 --> 00:49:58,749
'Where the hell are you?'

418
00:50:20,408 --> 00:50:21,789
'Are you deaf?'

419
00:50:22,968 --> 00:50:25,388
'I have been ringing the doorbell.
Why didn't you open the door?'

420
00:50:27,168 --> 00:50:28,189
'Why do you look so terrified?'

421
00:50:30,608 --> 00:50:31,529
'Upstairs...'

422
00:50:32,672 --> 00:50:33,512
'Upstairs!!'

423
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,108
'Who's upstairs?'

424
00:50:36,303 --> 00:50:37,938
'With whom were you
watching this dirty film?'

425
00:50:38,448 --> 00:50:39,528
'No. You are misunderstanding.'

426
00:50:39,663 --> 00:50:40,748
'Am I misunderstanding?'

427
00:50:41,768 --> 00:50:44,829
'I am asking you who's upstairs?
Whom are you meeting in my absence?'

428
00:50:45,808 --> 00:50:46,628
'That... Cable Guy.'

429
00:50:48,448 --> 00:50:51,506
'Cable Guy!
What were you doing with the Cable Guy?'

430
00:50:52,128 --> 00:50:53,913
'No No. You are misunderstanding.'

431
00:50:53,954 --> 00:50:56,395
'I have understood everything!!'

432
00:50:57,016 --> 00:50:57,906
'I won't spare him.'

433
00:50:58,448 --> 00:50:59,608
'Step aside.'

434
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:03,384
'Or I will thrash you
before I take care of him.'

435
00:51:03,425 --> 00:51:05,444
'You are not getting me. Let me explain.'

436
00:51:28,928 --> 00:51:30,747
'Where are you? Where are you?'

437
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:32,787
'Come out.'

438
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,874
'I am going to kill you.'

439
00:51:36,448 --> 00:51:37,147
'Where are you?'

440
00:51:58,088 --> 00:52:01,503
- '- I'll kill you!
- Help me!'

441
00:52:01,544 --> 00:52:04,116
'Hey stop!'

442
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:05,568
'Help me!'

443
00:52:05,728 --> 00:52:07,499
'I'll kill you.'

444
00:52:07,848 --> 00:52:08,583
'Help me!'

445
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:11,257
'Stop! Where the hell are you going?'

446
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:13,725
'Hey stop!'

447
00:52:14,248 --> 00:52:18,929
'Listen to me. What are you doing?'

448
00:52:24,288 --> 00:52:27,801
'What are you doing? Listen to me.'

449
00:52:28,768 --> 00:52:30,108
'Let me explain.'

450
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:32,543
'Please listen to me.'

451
00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:34,724
'No.'

452
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,637
For 3 days,
I was being treated by Dr. Javed Shaikh.

453
00:52:42,048 --> 00:52:43,670
I am lucky to have survived.

454
00:52:46,036 --> 00:52:48,228
You have committed a big
mistake by getting him bail.

455
00:52:49,143 --> 00:52:52,381
He's just out on bail.
Not acquitted of all charges.

456
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:57,147
My husband getting out
on bail is not good for me.

457
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,303
Now, I am even more frightened...

458
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:02,535
...because he hasn't showed up.

459
00:53:04,544 --> 00:53:07,148
But, I know he is going to come back.

460
00:53:09,063 --> 00:53:10,587
And, he is definitely going to kill me.

461
00:53:11,781 --> 00:53:14,695
You don't worry.
He won't do anything like that.

462
00:53:16,406 --> 00:53:17,767
Will you come to my rescue?

463
00:53:27,408 --> 00:53:28,588
Will you come to my rescue?

464
00:55:26,064 --> 00:55:29,189
Javed, you are not a doctor.
You are a monster!

465
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:34,212
You need a psychiatrist!

466
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,104
Hey!

467
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:29,304
Catch him.

468
00:58:29,488 --> 00:58:31,607
Stop! I say stop!

469
00:58:31,648 --> 00:58:32,288
Hey!

470
00:58:43,301 --> 00:58:44,434
Stop.

471
00:58:51,246 --> 00:58:52,527
Move.

472
00:59:13,608 --> 00:59:17,397
Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir!

473
00:59:20,311 --> 00:59:21,436
Sir.

474
00:59:24,288 --> 00:59:26,208
Sir! Sir! Sir!

475
00:59:26,512 --> 00:59:28,189
Sir! Sir! Please sir!

476
00:59:28,608 --> 00:59:31,983
Did you think you will get away from me?

477
00:59:32,024 --> 00:59:32,791
No, sir.

478
00:59:35,368 --> 00:59:37,143
Weren't you there
in the storage room that day?

479
00:59:37,184 --> 00:59:39,144
Wasn't it you, who attacked with the knife?

480
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,480
Yes officer!

481
00:59:42,808 --> 00:59:45,048
I was present in that room.

482
00:59:46,048 --> 00:59:49,842
But it's not what it looks like.

483
00:59:50,808 --> 00:59:54,567
I swear, I did not commit any crime.

484
00:59:57,088 --> 01:00:02,927
Sir, whenever I visited that house
to collect the payment...

485
01:00:03,816 --> 01:00:07,975
...Sindoora Madam used to behave strange.

486
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:11,624
Sir.

487
01:00:12,648 --> 01:00:20,991
She would ask me to come home
only when her husband was out.

488
01:00:21,824 --> 01:00:25,589
I was very scared of that woman.

489
01:00:26,703 --> 01:00:31,464
Didn't I tell you that
I want only the truth?

490
01:00:32,648 --> 01:00:36,285
Officer, I am telling you the truth.

491
01:00:38,248 --> 01:00:41,976
Sir, this year our company
decided to wish all its clients...

492
01:00:42,008 --> 01:00:47,068
...by presenting a
bouquet on their birthdays.

493
01:00:48,048 --> 01:00:50,388
That day was
Sindoora Madam's birthday.

494
01:00:51,368 --> 01:00:55,275
So, I went to her house with a bouquet.

495
01:01:00,168 --> 01:01:01,520
'Happy Birthday Madam.'

496
01:01:01,688 --> 01:01:04,161
'Hey!! How do you know?'

497
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:07,798
'Ma'am, our company maintains
a database of all our customers.'

498
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,397
'It is on behalf of our company'

499
01:01:10,644 --> 01:01:11,237
'Oh really!'

500
01:01:13,797 --> 01:01:14,914
'Come on. Why are you lying?'

501
01:01:17,357 --> 01:01:19,597
'I know you got this bouquet for me.'

502
01:01:19,853 --> 01:01:20,473
'Isn't it?'

503
01:01:21,704 --> 01:01:22,501
'This...'

504
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:48,288
'Madam please, my payment.'

505
01:01:49,341 --> 01:01:50,066
'My payment.'

506
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:52,868
'Payment!'

507
01:01:58,128 --> 01:01:59,983
- 'You will get your payment.
- Madam'

508
01:02:00,797 --> 01:02:07,197
'Madam, Please! Please! Please!'

509
01:02:08,648 --> 01:02:10,286
'Madam, Please.'

510
01:02:11,948 --> 01:02:14,828
'Madam, this isn't right.'

511
01:02:15,157 --> 01:02:16,089
'What?'

512
01:02:16,368 --> 01:02:17,476
'This isn't right.'

513
01:02:17,528 --> 01:02:18,503
'What's not right?'

514
01:02:21,288 --> 01:02:22,343
'What's not right?'

515
01:02:23,288 --> 01:02:24,627
'Your husband may come back, madam.'

516
01:02:25,597 --> 01:02:26,695
- 'My husband!
- Yes.'

517
01:02:27,168 --> 01:02:27,975
'He will misunderstand.'

518
01:02:28,306 --> 01:02:29,596
'My husband!'

519
01:02:29,637 --> 01:02:30,997
'Madam, Please!'

520
01:02:32,037 --> 01:02:33,188
'Don't worry.'

521
01:02:33,968 --> 01:02:35,532
'My husband is not expected until evening.'

522
01:02:37,168 --> 01:02:38,698
'We've got enough time.'

523
01:02:50,368 --> 01:02:51,668
'Madam, please!'

524
01:02:55,295 --> 01:02:56,962
'Madam, please!'

525
01:03:08,248 --> 01:03:09,588
'Madam, please!'

526
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:16,667
'No!'

527
01:03:23,688 --> 01:03:26,720
'Madam, I warned you.
Your husband will be back.'

528
01:03:27,448 --> 01:03:30,128
'If he finds me here with you,
he will kill me.'

529
01:03:30,317 --> 01:03:31,313
'Ma'am...'

530
01:03:33,848 --> 01:03:34,868
'Shut up!'

531
01:03:35,993 --> 01:03:38,024
'Stop crying like a baby.'

532
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:39,235
'Your husband.'

533
01:03:41,048 --> 01:03:42,015
'Let me think.'

534
01:03:45,393 --> 01:03:48,822
'Come on, get up! Fast!'

535
01:03:51,008 --> 01:03:52,089
'Hold on.'

536
01:04:00,928 --> 01:04:02,353
'Ma'am... Ma'am... Ma'am...'

537
01:04:02,408 --> 01:04:03,248
'Take this.'

538
01:04:03,688 --> 01:04:04,650
'Madam, what is this?'

539
01:04:05,354 --> 01:04:07,548
'If my husband comes looking for you,
stab him.'

540
01:04:07,808 --> 01:04:09,486
'No, no ma'am. I can't do this, madam.'

541
01:04:09,874 --> 01:04:12,994
'Idiot. If you don't kill him,
he will kill you.'

542
01:04:13,074 --> 01:04:14,353
'Come on! Come on! Come on!'

543
01:04:19,888 --> 01:04:22,361
- 'Madam.
- Hide inside!'

544
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:32,633
'I have been ringing the doorbell.
Why didn't you open the door?'

545
01:04:32,754 --> 01:04:35,954
'You have your keys, right?'

546
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:37,440
'What's all this?'

547
01:04:37,808 --> 01:04:40,808
'Why do you keep
watching such dirty films?'

548
01:04:41,328 --> 01:04:44,350
'It's not necessary what you
find dirty even others should.'

549
01:04:44,808 --> 01:04:46,008
'And who got you this bouquet?'

550
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:46,909
'Why do you care?'

551
01:04:48,568 --> 01:04:49,388
'Who's upstairs?'

552
01:04:52,714 --> 01:04:53,799
'Who is hiding there?'

553
01:04:55,274 --> 01:04:57,068
- 'I am asking you who's upstairs.
- Stop!!'

554
01:04:58,168 --> 01:04:58,987
'Ohh!'

555
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:04,274
'So you have called
someone in my absence.'

556
01:05:05,074 --> 01:05:06,947
'Stop blabbering the same
thing again and again.'

557
01:05:09,594 --> 01:05:14,074
'Let me see whom you meet in my absence.'

558
01:05:16,185 --> 01:05:17,427
'You won't like it.'

559
01:05:19,794 --> 01:05:21,424
'You think I like it otherwise! Move.'

560
01:05:24,558 --> 01:05:27,628
I attacked him only to defend myself.

561
01:05:29,928 --> 01:05:30,952
You are lying.

562
01:05:32,158 --> 01:05:36,526
You and Sindoora, both hatched
the plan to kill Raghuram Singh.

563
01:05:37,698 --> 01:05:38,698
No sir.

564
01:05:39,008 --> 01:05:40,667
There was no plan, officer.

565
01:05:42,253 --> 01:05:47,448
I am not lying.
She is the one responsible for everything.

566
01:06:48,968 --> 01:06:51,010
'THE TIME HAS COME'

567
01:07:22,476 --> 01:07:23,788
Sir, you!

568
01:07:24,438 --> 01:07:27,478
Don't worry.
I just want to ask you a question.

569
01:07:28,008 --> 01:07:30,928
No no sir. I don't know anything.

570
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:33,512
You are denying even before
I have asked you anything.

571
01:07:33,688 --> 01:07:37,208
Sir, please don't involve me in this.
I am a poor man.

572
01:07:37,568 --> 01:07:39,703
Anyways, I have quit that job.

573
01:07:40,278 --> 01:07:41,388
Why did you quit?

574
01:07:43,336 --> 01:07:45,726
Sir, I am afraid of that house.

575
01:07:46,364 --> 01:07:47,272
Why are you afraid?

576
01:07:49,672 --> 01:07:50,547
What happens over there?

577
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:53,132
Sir, please do not involve me in this.

578
01:07:53,368 --> 01:07:55,126
After all,
such things can't stay hidden for long.

579
01:07:55,492 --> 01:07:56,281
What things?

580
01:07:56,928 --> 01:07:58,382
Listen...

581
01:08:02,488 --> 01:08:04,010
- Hello.
- Help!

582
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,928
- Mr. Verma, he will kill me.
- Hello.

583
01:08:05,968 --> 01:08:07,768
- Mrs. Sindoora! Hello!
- Help me!

584
01:08:08,128 --> 01:08:09,221
What's wrong sir?

585
01:08:09,895 --> 01:08:11,065
What's wrong sir?

586
01:08:13,608 --> 01:08:14,368
Sir.

587
01:08:55,332 --> 01:08:56,192
Sindoora ji!

588
01:09:00,214 --> 01:09:00,857
Sindoora ji!

589
01:09:06,848 --> 01:09:07,644
Sindoora ji!

590
01:09:52,368 --> 01:09:53,256
Sindoora ji!

591
01:10:07,047 --> 01:10:07,901
Sindoora ji!

592
01:11:22,082 --> 01:11:22,682
You!!

593
01:11:23,448 --> 01:11:25,068
Don't worry, Mr. Verma.

594
01:11:25,762 --> 01:11:29,583
I am fine. Please, have a seat.

595
01:11:40,642 --> 01:11:41,548
Who was here?

596
01:11:42,649 --> 01:11:43,354
My husband.

597
01:11:43,802 --> 01:11:44,626
Raghuram Singh!

598
01:11:45,408 --> 01:11:46,547
How could he come here?

599
01:11:47,608 --> 01:11:48,867
His bail got rejected.

600
01:11:50,322 --> 01:11:53,379
Is this a joke? He was here sometime back.

601
01:11:53,762 --> 01:11:55,015
You are lying madam.

602
01:11:55,848 --> 01:11:57,307
Raghuram Singh is still in the lock up.

603
01:11:58,682 --> 01:12:00,989
I lied to you about his bail.

604
01:12:08,337 --> 01:12:11,309
Don't worry Mr. Verma. No one was here.

605
01:12:14,088 --> 01:12:20,442
I was just confirming, if you would
come to my rescue when I am in trouble.

606
01:12:21,047 --> 01:12:22,067
What nonsense?

607
01:12:23,577 --> 01:12:27,617
- I am leaving.
- Hey! Please sit.

608
01:12:29,368 --> 01:12:32,349
It's good to see someone
being concerned about me.

609
01:12:35,408 --> 01:12:36,743
Are you married, Mr. Verma?

610
01:12:41,848 --> 01:12:44,667
It seems you've been so preoccupied
that you forgot to get married.

611
01:12:46,248 --> 01:12:50,286
It's good you are single and free.

612
01:12:50,608 --> 01:12:54,215
It seems you are regretting your marriage.

613
01:12:55,882 --> 01:12:58,442
Honestly, I detest marriage.

614
01:13:00,608 --> 01:13:03,547
Like any other girl,
I dreamt of a perfect wedding.

615
01:13:06,368 --> 01:13:10,028
Life felt like a fairy tale where
only good things happen.

616
01:13:11,768 --> 01:13:14,461
But, after getting married,
I realized I was wrong.

617
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:19,701
I found that my husband
is somewhat, different.

618
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,903
Different?

619
01:13:23,368 --> 01:13:24,667
I belong to a middle class family.

620
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:27,527
I was taught from childhood that...

621
01:13:27,568 --> 01:13:29,469
...'GHOONGHAT' is one
of the biggest assets of a woman.

622
01:13:31,288 --> 01:13:33,448
But my husband never appreciated it.

623
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:36,669
Gradually, he started staying away from me.

624
01:13:37,728 --> 01:13:40,508
He would shut himself in a
room after returning from work.

625
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:44,588
Then, something happened 3 years back...

626
01:15:32,371 --> 01:15:32,811
'You!'

627
01:15:34,979 --> 01:15:36,187
'When did you come?'

628
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:45,890
'What is this?'

629
01:15:50,368 --> 01:15:51,600
'What has happened to you?'

630
01:15:52,487 --> 01:15:54,008
Where are you lost these days?'

631
01:15:54,773 --> 01:15:56,664
'I don't feel like coming home.'

632
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:58,490
'Why?'

633
01:15:59,948 --> 01:16:01,405
'Did I do anything wrong?'

634
01:16:02,179 --> 01:16:03,827
'Yes, you have.'

635
01:16:08,288 --> 01:16:08,968
'What?'

636
01:16:09,128 --> 01:16:10,546
'You don't entice me anymore.'

637
01:16:12,288 --> 01:16:14,048
'Why are you saying this?'

638
01:16:14,506 --> 01:16:17,388
'You were looking like a fairy
on the day of our marriage.'

639
01:16:19,288 --> 01:16:21,228
'I could never let you out of my sight.'

640
01:16:22,488 --> 01:16:27,128
'But now, I don't feel
like looking at you.'

641
01:16:30,368 --> 01:16:31,716
'Why are you talking like this?'

642
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:34,314
'You are scaring me.'

643
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:37,106
'Look at her.'

644
01:16:40,688 --> 01:16:43,688
'She is not a mannequin, she's a woman.'

645
01:16:44,608 --> 01:16:48,328
'Can you see how ravishing
she looks in these clothes.'

646
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:52,346
'I wish she comes to life.'

647
01:16:54,328 --> 01:16:55,386
'And look at you.'

648
01:16:56,039 --> 01:16:58,956
'Covered from head to toe...'

649
01:16:59,888 --> 01:17:01,700
'Completely lifeless.'

650
01:17:03,088 --> 01:17:06,088
'You are scaring me.
Why are you behaving like this?'

651
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:08,330
'No... No.'

652
01:17:08,587 --> 01:17:10,561
'You will have to do
something different...'

653
01:17:11,163 --> 01:17:15,803
'...something like what
'MENAKA'...'

654
01:17:16,008 --> 01:17:17,388
'...had done for 'VISHWAMITRA'.'

655
01:17:17,808 --> 01:17:20,968
'The kind of clothes you wear,
they make me sick.'

656
01:17:21,888 --> 01:17:23,448
'It doesn't show enough skin.'

657
01:17:23,489 --> 01:17:24,207
'Undress.'

658
01:17:24,248 --> 01:17:26,768
- '- What are you doing?
- Undress.'

659
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,206
- '- What are you doing?
- Undress.'

660
01:17:28,248 --> 01:17:29,368
'What are you doing?'

661
01:17:32,928 --> 01:17:35,728
'What this woman is wearing, it's for you.'

662
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:38,292
'Wear it and show me.'

663
01:17:39,848 --> 01:17:44,247
'I am your 'VISHWAMITRA'
and you are my 'MENAKA'.'

664
01:17:44,288 --> 01:17:46,764
- '- Why are you saying like this?
- Seduce me.'

665
01:17:47,058 --> 01:17:48,458
'SEDUCE ME!!'

666
01:17:48,648 --> 01:17:50,753
'I am your 'VISHWAMITRA'!!'

667
01:17:50,794 --> 01:17:52,503
'Look at me. Look at me.'

668
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:54,823
- '- You are my 'MENAKA'!
- No.'

669
01:17:55,088 --> 01:17:57,050
'SEDUCE ME!!'

670
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:12,050
I have been hoping for things
to get better for past two years.

671
01:18:13,523 --> 01:18:15,556
He would come home with
a new demand every night.

672
01:18:18,738 --> 01:18:22,578
But then last year,
something terrible started happening.

673
01:18:26,808 --> 01:18:28,768
He came up with bizarre demands.

674
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:30,343
Demands!

675
01:18:31,168 --> 01:18:31,950
What demands?

676
01:25:10,653 --> 01:25:11,445
Cut me loose!

677
01:25:11,893 --> 01:25:13,034
Why the hell have you tied me up?

678
01:25:13,448 --> 01:25:14,281
Release me!!

679
01:25:17,013 --> 01:25:18,258
Release me! What the hell?

680
01:25:24,533 --> 01:25:25,426
What's all this?

681
01:25:27,613 --> 01:25:29,973
And why are you wearing a Burqa?

682
01:25:32,848 --> 01:25:35,348
Come out of this lawyer's character, Javed!

683
01:25:35,608 --> 01:25:36,567
Who is Javed?

684
01:25:37,965 --> 01:25:40,048
What's this rubbish, Mrs. Sindoora?

685
01:26:03,288 --> 01:26:04,338
What's all this?

686
01:26:05,325 --> 01:26:07,582
And why is there a lock up here?

687
01:26:08,773 --> 01:26:10,738
Come out of this character, Javed!

688
01:26:12,212 --> 01:26:14,189
For how long will this go on?

689
01:26:14,352 --> 01:26:15,246
What!!

690
01:26:15,688 --> 01:26:17,964
I don't know what you are talking about.

691
01:26:19,514 --> 01:26:20,238
Fine!

692
01:26:21,571 --> 01:26:23,218
To hell with your fantasies.

693
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,228
I am leaving.

694
01:26:24,973 --> 01:26:25,778
Stop!

695
01:26:26,133 --> 01:26:27,058
Afreen.

696
01:26:28,656 --> 01:26:29,349
Afreen.

697
01:26:36,933 --> 01:26:39,175
From now on, you are Raghuram
Singh's wife Sindoora Singh.

698
01:26:40,008 --> 01:26:42,747
I will be meeting you as Manas Verma,
your husband's lawyer.

699
01:26:43,608 --> 01:26:46,648
You will narrate me a story based
on Sindoora Singh's statement.

700
01:26:46,808 --> 01:26:49,027
And then one day, you will trick
me into coming to the house...

701
01:26:49,253 --> 01:26:50,373
...and rape me.

702
01:26:51,488 --> 01:26:52,200
Rape!!

703
01:26:53,322 --> 01:26:55,637
Have you gone mad, Javed?

704
01:26:58,088 --> 01:26:58,919
Not Javed.

705
01:27:00,118 --> 01:27:00,871
Manas.

706
01:27:10,368 --> 01:27:13,108
After so many days you have
called me by my real name.

707
01:27:15,218 --> 01:27:17,708
Don't start this all over again, Afreen.

708
01:27:19,493 --> 01:27:20,268
No Javed.

709
01:27:22,169 --> 01:27:24,108
I am putting an end to this madness today.

710
01:27:25,093 --> 01:27:28,230
Afreen, I'll die without you.

711
01:27:29,195 --> 01:27:31,435
You know that I love you a lot.

712
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:32,980
Love!

713
01:27:34,728 --> 01:27:36,668
You have never loved me Javed.

714
01:27:37,248 --> 01:27:39,699
You just love your madness.

715
01:27:45,688 --> 01:27:49,408
Afreen, we have been through this before.

716
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:54,058
You know we have been
doing this to save our marriage.

717
01:27:54,477 --> 01:27:57,371
And anyways, Raghuram and
Sindoora's story is almost over.

718
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,926
Stay away from that woman.

719
01:27:59,768 --> 01:28:01,379
She's very manipulative.

720
01:28:01,408 --> 01:28:05,449
She's ignoring you,
so that you get attracted towards her.

721
01:28:05,968 --> 01:28:06,636
Hello!

722
01:28:07,704 --> 01:28:09,426
Hello!

723
01:28:09,595 --> 01:28:10,237
Hello!

724
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:14,267
This will never end Javed.

725
01:28:15,768 --> 01:28:19,387
Tomorrow, you will find another
woman and you would want me to be her.

726
01:28:20,541 --> 01:28:22,467
There is no end to your fetish.

727
01:28:23,728 --> 01:28:28,777
But today, you have stooped so low that
you wanted to get raped by your own wife.

728
01:28:49,383 --> 01:28:50,781
I am sick of you.

729
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:54,467
Afreen, maybe I am wrong.

730
01:28:55,303 --> 01:28:59,361
But trust me, I have never loved
any other woman except you.

731
01:29:01,543 --> 01:29:04,783
But you've always seen other women in me.
Haven't you?

732
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:07,267
What do you get out of this?

733
01:29:08,288 --> 01:29:12,135
You will never understand the pleasure
in getting closer to someone else's wife.

734
01:29:14,208 --> 01:29:15,744
I can't be a part of this madness.

735
01:29:19,248 --> 01:29:20,868
What sort of madness is this, Javed?

736
01:29:21,663 --> 01:29:23,543
You come home like a stranger.

737
01:29:23,697 --> 01:29:26,183
And force your wife into Role play.

738
01:29:28,688 --> 01:29:29,735
But, what's wrong with this?

739
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,021
Whatever we do, we do it inside our house.

740
01:29:33,968 --> 01:29:35,768
And Afreen, you were doing so well.

741
01:29:36,048 --> 01:29:39,475
But, why do you keep bringing
up our stories in between?

742
01:29:39,893 --> 01:29:42,142
You shouldn't have talked
about the mannequin incident.

743
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:45,143
My husband is different.

744
01:29:47,168 --> 01:29:49,808
- 'You are my 'MENAKA',
- I am your 'VISHWAMITRA'!!'

745
01:29:49,849 --> 01:29:52,231
- 'SEDUCE ME!!
- SEDUCE ME!!'

746
01:29:54,743 --> 01:29:55,442
No Javed.

747
01:29:56,775 --> 01:29:57,703
That's it.

748
01:29:58,702 --> 01:30:00,435
I can't be a part of this anymore.

749
01:30:01,263 --> 01:30:04,552
- I am freeing myself today.
- No.

750
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:07,034
I want to live my life as Afreen.

751
01:30:07,423 --> 01:30:08,517
As Afreen.

752
01:30:08,728 --> 01:30:10,928
No. No!! Afreen!

753
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:13,746
I'll go mad if you leave me.

754
01:30:14,328 --> 01:30:16,481
No one understands me better than you.

755
01:30:16,743 --> 01:30:17,674
Afreen...

756
01:31:06,048 --> 01:31:09,048
He's still breathing Sharma.
Quickly, send him to the hospital.

757
01:31:09,077 --> 01:31:09,602
Yes sir.

758
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:50,946
'Mrs. Sindoora, what happened that day?'

759
01:31:51,967 --> 01:31:53,267
'It was my birthday.'

760
01:31:54,188 --> 01:31:56,347
'I had a severe headache.'

761
01:31:57,148 --> 01:31:59,427
'That's when the Cable Guy
came home to collect the payment.'

762
01:32:00,703 --> 01:32:04,547
'He was holding a bouquet
which was sent from his company.'

763
01:32:05,743 --> 01:32:08,627
'Suddenly,
I felt dizzy and I collapsed on him.'

764
01:32:11,448 --> 01:32:13,575
'And he took advantage of that.'

765
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:24,627
'Dr. Javed, I am giving you
the copy of this diary at my risk.'

766
01:32:26,887 --> 01:32:27,975
'Thank you so much Sir.'

767
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,078
'But, I want one more favor.'

768
01:32:31,462 --> 01:32:32,067
'Yes.'

769
01:32:32,969 --> 01:32:37,660
'When you catch hold of that Cable Guy.
Can I be present during interrogation?'

770
01:32:38,063 --> 01:32:41,055
'But, why are you
so interested in this case?'

771
01:32:41,576 --> 01:32:43,190
'Just for academic knowledge.'

772
01:32:59,294 --> 01:33:01,571
I am going to disappear after tonight.

773
01:33:02,486 --> 01:33:04,875
I have burnt all the proofs of my identity.

774
01:33:07,109 --> 01:33:09,241
'I hope no one will be able to trace me.'

775
01:33:11,128 --> 01:33:14,281
'But, before I leave,
I want to reveal something.'

776
01:33:14,928 --> 01:33:20,789
'A kind of reality you probably
haven't seen or heard before.'

777
01:33:21,778 --> 01:33:25,823
'A sin, that makes me hate myself.'

778
01:33:26,023 --> 01:33:28,556
Sir, have a look. There are some
weird things written in these papers.

779
01:33:36,048 --> 01:33:38,375
It's very strange Sir,
that someone could do like this.

780
01:33:38,888 --> 01:33:41,912
Giving instructions to his
wife to say and do things.

781
01:33:41,953 --> 01:33:43,993
'Mrs. Sindoora I just
want to know the truth.'

782
01:33:44,426 --> 01:33:46,870
'I don't want to talk to
my husband's lawyer.'

783
01:33:50,528 --> 01:33:55,150
I was scared of Dr. Javed.
He was very strange.

784
01:33:55,544 --> 01:33:58,251
He would dress up as a woman at home.

785
01:33:58,608 --> 01:34:01,927
I have seen him calling his
own wife by different names.

786
01:34:01,968 --> 01:34:03,633
'Is Sindoora Raghuram Singh home?'

787
01:34:06,446 --> 01:34:09,328
'You'll must be thinking why I
kept quiet for so many years?'

788
01:34:09,568 --> 01:34:10,598
'Honestly speaking...'

789
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:16,326
'...I never realized when his small
fantasies turned into wild fetish.'

790
01:34:16,688 --> 01:34:20,328
I am the investigating officer of
Sindoora and Raghuram Singh's case.

791
01:34:20,568 --> 01:34:23,048
A building contractor by profession...

792
01:34:23,103 --> 01:34:25,863
...Raghuram Singh always suspected
his wife Sindoora Singh's character...

793
01:34:26,208 --> 01:34:28,288
...which led to a lot of
fights between them.

794
01:34:28,368 --> 01:34:30,488
Few days back, Sindoora Singh
filed a complaint against Raghuram Singh...

795
01:34:30,543 --> 01:34:32,245
...under section 307.

796
01:34:32,808 --> 01:34:34,608
Due to a head injury...

797
01:34:34,648 --> 01:34:38,806
...Sindoora Singh was treated
by Dr. Javed in his clinic.

798
01:34:39,648 --> 01:34:44,191
And during investigation, Dr. Javed
closely observed Sindoora Singh...

799
01:34:44,288 --> 01:34:48,007
...and turned his wife Afreen into Sindoora
and started meeting her as a lawyer.

800
01:34:48,183 --> 01:34:51,227
'I am Manas Verma,
your husband Raghuram Singh's lawyer.'

801
01:34:51,568 --> 01:34:54,859
'Sir, I have never seen or
heard anything like this before.'

802
01:34:55,128 --> 01:34:58,273
'Javed would often meet
Afreen like a stranger.'

803
01:34:58,903 --> 01:35:00,559
'She used to be very upset.'

804
01:35:00,983 --> 01:35:03,703
'She would share her problems with me.'

805
01:35:04,063 --> 01:35:08,329
'Many times I tried to inform the police,
but Afreen always stopped me.'

806
01:35:08,983 --> 01:35:13,180
'I have recorded their
conversation in this tape recorder.'

807
01:35:14,328 --> 01:35:18,284
'You will be amazed to know that he
had also met Afreen Shaikh in my disguise.'

808
01:35:21,528 --> 01:35:23,625
'I feel I am the one
responsible for all this.'

809
01:35:23,728 --> 01:35:26,048
'Because, had I opposed
my husband the very first day...'

810
01:35:26,103 --> 01:35:28,183
'...this wouldn't have come this far.'

811
01:35:28,368 --> 01:35:31,222
In the house, we found an
exact replica of a police lockup.

812
01:35:31,263 --> 01:35:33,767
And it seems
Dr. Javed would dress up his wife...

813
01:35:33,808 --> 01:35:35,568
...as Raghuram Singh for interrogation.

814
01:35:35,688 --> 01:35:38,500
'You will now pretend as
Raghuram Singh and tell me...'

815
01:35:39,088 --> 01:35:41,470
'...that your wife is
plotting against you.'

816
01:35:41,528 --> 01:35:43,728
'Why don't you believe me,
that woman is trying to frame me.'

817
01:35:43,769 --> 01:35:46,049
'There is nothing called
love in my wife's dictionary.'

818
01:35:46,528 --> 01:35:48,808
'Once, he dropped an envelope
in his own car...'

819
01:35:48,849 --> 01:35:52,932
'...and started reading it as
if someone else put it there.'

820
01:35:53,988 --> 01:35:57,453
'The gardener would often advise
me to go and complaint to the Police...'

821
01:35:57,541 --> 01:36:00,890
'...but I thought why should we
interfere in someone's private matter.'

822
01:36:01,728 --> 01:36:04,143
All the evidences found
in the house prove that...

823
01:36:04,183 --> 01:36:08,023
...Dr. Javed was imagining someone
else's incident in his own house.

824
01:36:08,557 --> 01:36:13,077
Clearly speaking, he was involved
in a one sided Role Play with his wife.

825
01:36:13,632 --> 01:36:15,838
And, Afreen Shaikh was
unwillingly participating in it.

826
01:36:15,879 --> 01:36:16,879
'So you did get angry?'

827
01:36:16,983 --> 01:36:18,437
'Yes I was angry.'

828
01:36:18,488 --> 01:36:19,539
'Who wouldn't be?'

829
01:36:19,568 --> 01:36:21,944
'Your head injury!!
You were wearing a bandage yesterday.'

830
01:36:22,223 --> 01:36:23,143
'I forgot.'

831
01:36:23,248 --> 01:36:26,542
'Afreen, don't forget that you are playing Sindoora's character.
- Javed.'

832
01:36:26,568 --> 01:36:29,368
'How could you leave the
house without a bandage?'

833
01:36:29,688 --> 01:36:33,471
'Please don't bother that old
man in our household matters.'

834
01:36:33,512 --> 01:36:36,632
'You know we've been doing
this to save our marriage.'

835
01:36:37,048 --> 01:36:39,289
'Honestly, I detest marriage.'

836
01:36:40,688 --> 01:36:41,729
'This is Madness.'

837
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:43,607
'After all such things
can't stay hidden for long.'

838
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:45,711
'I am putting an end
to this madness today.'

839
01:36:45,768 --> 01:36:47,927
'I want to live my life as Afreen.'

840
01:36:47,968 --> 01:36:48,928
'As Afreen.'

841
01:36:51,608 --> 01:36:53,407
Sir, can we assume
that Afreen Shaikh...

842
01:36:53,448 --> 01:36:54,888
...was a victim of psychological rape?

843
01:36:55,188 --> 01:36:57,628
And will her husband
Dr. Javed Shaikh be convicted?

844
01:36:57,788 --> 01:36:59,729
The investigation has just begun.

845
01:36:59,977 --> 01:37:01,457
If there is any progress
I shall update you.

846
01:37:01,537 --> 01:37:03,087
- Okay. Let me go.
- Sir. Sir.

847
01:37:03,128 --> 01:37:04,807
Sir, Will Afreen Shaikh be taken into custody?
- No comments.

848
01:37:04,848 --> 01:37:07,727
- Sir. Sir, do Raghuram and Sindoora know...
- No more questions, please.

849
01:37:07,768 --> 01:37:10,848
...that their case was being used by Dr. Javed for Role play?
- Sir.

850
01:37:10,888 --> 01:37:13,088
- Is Role play a disease?
- Sir. Sir.

851
01:37:13,112 --> 01:37:14,985
Is Role play illegal?

852
01:37:40,616 --> 01:37:42,383
What do you get out of this?

853
01:37:43,288 --> 01:37:45,407
You will never
understand the pleasure...

854
01:37:45,448 --> 01:37:47,208
...in getting closer to
someone else's wife.
