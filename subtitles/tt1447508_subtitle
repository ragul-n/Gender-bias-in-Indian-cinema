- Hi, Budhia.
- Hello.

29
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,749
Any luck?

30
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:12,874
At it already, huh?
Wait till you get home.

(Dhaniya) Back home finally?

What did the bank want?

Nothing.

00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:51,540
So the bank called you
for a cup of tea, is it?

At least you'll get something.

Cat got your tongue?
Why did they call you?

39
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:10,290

Why did the bank call you?

42
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:22,499
Because they're auctioning
the damn farm, that's why.

43
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,624
Oh, Lord!

44
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,249

Visit each house personally.

Why?

79
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,082
You should've summoned me instead.

80
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,665
Can we help with the election campaign?

81
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:08,040
What? "Help" in the campaign?

Do I look like a fool?

We had mortgaged the land
for a bank loan.

00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,415
So why come to me?

86
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,665
Go to the government.

87
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,540
They lent you the money, right?

88
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,415

- Yes.

00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,874
What?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

107
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,915
In South India, the government
has started a new programme,

108
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,957
by which farmers who commit suicide
due to debt

109
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,082
get 1 00,000 rupees compensation.

110
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,290
- Does what? Suicide?
- Yes, suicide.

111
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,832
(All laugh)

113
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,374
farmers are killing themselves
by the dozen.

114
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,915
Living is like an old-fashioned bell-bottom,
while suicide, the latest jeans!

115
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:54,665
The government too likes
a fair give and take.

116
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:58,499
There's at least one thing
you can give...your life.

117
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,957
Let's go.

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,374

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,874
Long live Bhai Thakur!

120
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,290
Budhia! Come, sit.

121
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,540
What did Bhai Thakur say?

122
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:35,415
He said, "Commit suicide
and the government will pay you."

123
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,207
Use that to clear your debt.

124
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,582
What?

125
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:42,082
Kill yourself
and you get 1 00,000 rupees.

126
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,624
Thinks we are stupid.

127
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,499
Really?
Would you get it if the wife died?

128
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,957
Go on, try it.

129
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,082
The government should take over
our lands

130
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:55,707
and give us farmers a pension to retire.

131
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,790
So you can sit around smoking pot.

132
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,999
So what good is farming?

133
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:04,124
American seeds, American fertilizers.

134
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,165
Pay for it, then pray for rain.

135
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,374
They are shoving farming up our arse.

136
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,790
Better shift to the city.

137
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,582
First get screwed in the village
then in the city.

138
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,415
This suicide idea isn't too bad.

139
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,624
What rot!

140
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,332
I don't mean you.

141
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:29,249
What if someone is already very ill?
Dying...

142
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,707
Take Ram Asre for instance.

143
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:35,999
Always ill. His life hangs on a thread.

144
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,540
What's the point of living like that?

145
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:42,415
What's wrong if his death
brings 1 00,000 rupees?

146
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,540
Not bad at all.

147
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,499
His life will be made.

148
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:55,040
Tell your wife that Bhai Thakur
has suggested suicide.

149
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:59,374
- Budhia, have you heard the tragic news?
- What?

150
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,207
Ram Khilawan was just
run over by a train.

151
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,082
- Really?
- Yes.

152
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,749
But we just saw him at Bhai Thakur's.
How did he find a train so quickly?

153
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:12,999
No, not that Ram. The one
from the village of the barber's wife.

154
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:14,999
Hey, listen!

155
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,582
And Ram Asre is also
on his last breath.

156
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:21,874
- Nonsense.
- Hang on, there is more. . .

157
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,457
This Bakki is a good-for-nothing.

158
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,249
Always spreading bad news.

159
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,874
We really are in a soup.

160
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,624
Hey, Budhia, have you heard?

161
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:38,499
The priest's daughter-in-law
jumped into a well and died.

162
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,415
Why?

163
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,040
That she didn't tell me.

164
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,749
Oh! She was young.

165
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,457
It's God's will, I guess.

166
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,415
All of us have to go some day.

167
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,665
Sooner or later.

168
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,707
But we all have to die.

169
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,499
See you later. Come on.

170
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,582
The funeral is at four.
Are you coming?

171
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,999
(Natha) Everyone is talking
about death today.

172
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,665
Looks like it's a day of death.

173
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,624
Shut up!

174
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:27,999
(Amma) Budhia,
put my bed under the sun.

175
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,707
Budhia, aren't you listening?

176
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,999
Put my bed under the sun.

177
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,957
I've spent half my life dragging you
in and out of the sun.

178
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,957
We are losing our land
and all you care for is sunshine?

179
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:49,915
And smoking pot all day
is sure to save the land, right?

180
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,790
You said you had no money!

181
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,790
Don't get worked up,
you'll have a fit.

182
00:15:54,916 --> 00:16:00,915
Curse your tongue. You want to kill me?
Why don't you get a fit?

183
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:04,457
Once you are done pampering your mum
tell me what Bhai Thakur said.

184
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,207
He told us to commit suicide.

185
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,749
You must've provoked him.

186
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,957
Right. Why don't you get
a rope and hang me?

187
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,124
Cut the drama out.

188
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,915
Go hang yourself, for all I care.

189
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,457
Put some sense into your wife.

190
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,915
She's driving me nuts.

191
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:27,540
You've smashed my brains!

192
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,374
May the darkest storms
descend upon you!

193
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,207
All thanks to this witch.

194
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,374
Yeah, right.

195
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,665
- Shut up, you tart!
- You shut up!

196
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:41,165
Fancy city doctor you wanted?
Go on, get your treatment now.

197
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,290
I curse the moment
I brought you home.

198
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:49,124
Wretch! You've ruined everything.

199
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,499
You scum bag.

200
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,915
Why are you
sitting like a zombie?

201
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,124
Harder, damn you!

202
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:07,415
Below the neck. Yes, there.

203
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,499
Haven't seen your wife for a while.

204
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,457
Has she gone to her mother's?

205
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,499
- Gudda Babu...
- What?

206
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:24,749
You mentioned about the suicide
compensation programme.

207
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,499
What about it?

208
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,040
How did you get to know?

209
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,249
Why? You want to die?

210
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,957
Tell me please...

211
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:40,415
Magan's son told me it was published
in Jan Morcha newspaper.

212
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,457
(Budhia) If I could...

213
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,457
...I'd give up my life to save our land.

214
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,457
At least your kids would be taken care of.

215
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,207
Remember when we stole money
from Pir Baba's shrine?

216
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,707
What a thrashing dad gave us.

217
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:32,040
I must say, he had a heavy hand.

218
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:35,040
Always left his mark.

219
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,999
Yeah, he could hit hard.

220
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,707
- I made some enquiries.
- About what?

221
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,415
About the suicide programme.

222
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,457
Commit suicide
and compensation is assured.

223
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,999
Guaranteed.

224
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:15,749
We've gone through so much
to protect our forefathers' land

225
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,665
and now we are losing it.

226
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:26,374
If I could, I would give up
my life to save it.

227
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,499
No, brother, why should
you give your life?

228
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,582
I'll give up mine.

229
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,457
Why you? I'll kill myself.

230
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,749
No, I will.

231
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,332
You have a wife and kids
to take care of.

232
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,957
You mustn't. I'll die.

233
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,457
No. I'll die.

234
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,415
Shut up, I'll die.

235
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,540
Think you're brave?

236
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,790
No, brother, I'll give up my life.

237
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,415
Sure?

238
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,290
Fine. You kill yourself.

239
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,582
Don't change your mind now.

240
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,707
It takes only two minutes.

241
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,582
Since you won't let me, you do it.

242
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,540
It's the same thing, really.

243
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:29,040
It's time for a short break but before that,
the headlines of the day.

244
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:34,374
Shilpa Shetty denies her earlier remarks
on her relations with Prince William.

245
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,999
Opinion polls predict

246
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,415
a comfortable victory
for Chief Minister Ram Yadav,

247
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,040
in the Mukhya Pradesh by-election.

248
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,665
And farmer suicides continue unabated

249
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,582
as 79 more take their lives
in the last one week alone.

250
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,082
After the break
Union Minister for Agriculture,

251
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:55,207
Mr Salim Kidwai, joins us to discuss
the farmer suicides' issue.

252
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,874
What is going on with the autocue?
Krish...

253
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,707
Yes, send him in.

254
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,082
Your number one fan is here.

255
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,374
Vivek...

256
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,957
- How are you, sir?
- ...handsome as ever.

257
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,415
Hello, Salim. Good to see you.

258
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:21,790
- You never came to my party.
- Yes, I'm so sorry about that, Salim.

259
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,374
I wasn't well,
I really couldn't have made it.

260
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,374
But you went to Jaitley's.

261
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,374
Yes, I did,
but I got sick after that.

262
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,082
I would love to have been there.

263
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:36,165
Must you be so heartless?

264
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,499
And we're coming out
of a break right now.

265
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,915
Welcome back to News at 9.
With us is Union Minister for Agriculture,

266
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,040
Mr Salim Kidwai.

267
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,874
Sir, every 8 hours a farmer in the country
has been committing suicide

268
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,874
which brings us to the unthinkable
number of 1 ,70,000 since 1 998.

269
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,790
Now, can the government
be called indifferent?

270
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,874
Media should check its facts
before reporting.

271
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,332
A number of these so called suicides
are actually natural deaths.

272
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:11,249
The government cannot be held
accountable for age or infirmity, can it?

273
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,665
So should the government just sit back
and let the farmers die?

274
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,082
- Is that what you're saying?
- Not at all.

275
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,124
We have waived loans,

276
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,665
we've increased credit,
we've started new irrigation policies.

277
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,040
Sir, but how do you propose

278
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,332
the government can stop
these farmer suicides?

279
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,874
Industrialisation.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

280
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,374
No developing nation can afford
to depend on agriculture alone.

281
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,290
You, as the Agriculture Minister
of the country,

282
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,790
you are saying that we should
forget agriculture

283
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,415
and look to industrialise,
when we have a...

284
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,832
You're putting words in my mouth.
No, I did not...

285
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,165
- ...is totally dependent...
- In fact...

286
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:43,790
Now to come to the elections, sir,
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

287
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:46,290
how important
are the Peepli by-elections for you?

288
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,915
The polls say that your candidate
does not stand a chance.

289
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,457
Let the elections take place.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

290
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:54,207
The people are fed up
of the strong-armed tactics

291
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,124
of this castist
communalist government.

292
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,540
But given the Chief Minister's boast

293
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,665
that he'll win this election
by a record margin,

294
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:03,374
you think your political reputation
is at stake here?

295
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,707
Not mine, his.
He's the one making these tall claims.

296
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,415
But your enmity with the Chief Minister
is out in the open.

297
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,582
It's hardly a secret, Mr Salim Kidwai.

298
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:17,749
'There is a saying in Hindi, you know.

299
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:22,332
'There may be disagreements in politics,
but never enmity.'

300
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,249
Bastard! He went to ITVN first?

301
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:31,874
Run the corporate scam story
on his brother round the clock.

302
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,999
He'll fall in line.

303
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:38,207
When does ITVN's
election programming begin?

304
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,707
I'm talking to you guys, are you deaf?

305
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,624
It's already on. They had Chief Minister
Ram Yadav yesterday.

306
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,749
Today, it's Mr Salim.

307
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:49,665
Sir, the TRP for this week is here.

308
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:53,665
The Sacred Pumpkin story
is topping the charts.

309
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:55,707
Boss loved this story.

310
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,540
I told him, it was Deepak's idea.

311
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:01,790
I flower under your shadow, sir.

312
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:05,082
Sir, I've got a great lead.

313
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,957
When Saif Ali Khan was in class eight
he kissed a girl.

314
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,290
The girl is still in love with him!

315
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,124
Will she appear on TV?

316
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,832
She will. I've spoken to her.

317
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,249
Firstly, get her byte.

318
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,415
Then Saif's denial, right, sir?

319
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:23,790
Since you're getting Saif,
might as well cover Kareena.

320
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,332
Will the mother talk?

321
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:28,082
Sir, I haven't spoken
to Sharmila madam yet.

322
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,582
Not Saif's mother, you fool, the girl's.

323
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,624
You think too much.

324
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,332
- There is a school teacher...
- Fine! We've got the story.

325
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,457
(Mobile rings)

326
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:39,124
Find some romantic footage of Saif.

327
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,415
From the film Yeh Dillagi.

328
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:43,165
Please chat less

329
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,790
and prepare for the OTS.

330
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:49,624
The headline will be
"The Twelve Year Smooch".

331
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,290
Wow! It's great.

332
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:55,165
C.M. Ram Yadav is coming to Delhi.

333
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,540
Go on then, get his byte.

334
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,415
- My respects, sir.
- Bless you.

335
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:15,749
A surprise visit, sir?
I rushed over so that I don't miss you.

336
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:16,874
Work.

337
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,207
- How is your boss?
- Fine. Sir, I needed a sound byte.

338
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:23,332
Of late, the English media
has been ranting against me.

339
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,082
Who watches them anyway?

340
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:28,290
We're the real journalists,
with a finger on the people's pulse.

341
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:32,915
Deepak, I want at least 1 5 stories
before the elections.

342
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:34,207
All positive.

343
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,290
You're going to win
by a record margin.

344
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:38,957
Of course I will.

345
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:42,749
- Sir, a small interview.
- Go ahead.

346
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,374
- Roll camera.
- Rolling, sir.

347
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,665
Please, move aside.

348
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,749
- Ready?
- Yes.

349
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:55,415
Chief Minister Yadav, what is your
government's biggest achievement?

350
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:57,499
Prosperity of farmers!

351
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:00,374
Prosperity of farmers
means prosperity of the nation!

352
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,457
What rubbish. Have you gone mad?

353
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:06,040
But he's doing it for your sake.

354
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:09,790
Why should he commit suicide?
What good are you?

355
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:12,624
You don't even have a family,
you commit suicide!

356
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,749
Precisely,

357
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,499
my death will bring nothing.

358
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:18,207
This way at least your children
will have the land.

359
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:20,790
Hang on...listen.

360
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:28,374
Have you lost it?

361
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,624
When you're of no use alive,
what good will you be dead?

362
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:35,332
I see.

363
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:37,832
So he's brainwashed you?

364
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:41,124
I've said nothing, ask him.

365
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:43,790
What doesn't a man do for his kids?

366
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:46,415
And for his mother?

367
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:47,582
Shut up, mother!

368
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:50,415
She is to blame for all this.

369
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:54,915
There she goes again.

370
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:58,374
Budhia, give her two slaps
and throw her out.

371
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,374
Let's see who dares!

372
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,999
- I'll break your bones.
- Get lost! Man-eater!

373
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,957
Bedridden good-for-nothing,
yak-yak-yak.

374
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:12,207
Get out! Thorn of a cactus!

375
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,332
Look how she's gone
to fetch water for you.

376
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,499
Notice how she's showing
her concern already.

377
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:21,249
Listen to the next one.

378
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:30,790
Cloth is aplenty
but the shirt is tight.

379
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:34,999
Clouds are aplenty,
but such little rain.

380
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:37,290
Drought.

381
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:42,415
Cars are aplenty,
but barely enough oil.

382
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:44,040
Try driving!

383
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,790
Rakesh?

384
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,915
THE DAILY JAN MORCHA
NEWSPAPER OFFICE

385
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:54,124
That is why,
on Iraq bombs were dropped!

386
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,999
The war was just business.
You know about Saddam, right?

387
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:01,124
Rakesh? There you are.

388
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,374
The Magistrate is visiting Peepli today.

389
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,124
He plans to announce a programme.
Go there and cover it.

390
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,582
I'll do it from here.

391
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:12,540
What do you mean?
You'll have to go there.

392
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:15,749
Mr Tyagi needs it with photographs.

393
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:19,540
Send Feroz to get the photos.
I'll write the interview here itself.

394
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:21,249
It's election time, boss.

395
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:25,165
Let me remind you Peepli is part
of the C.M.'s constituency.

396
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:28,832
Nothing has changed in Peepli
in the past 60 years

397
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,457
so what will this election achieve?

398
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,082
Power is back.

399
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:35,582
Start the machine.

400
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:38,124
(TV) '...boundaries
to machinery high-rises,

406
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:54,457
Come on, Aunin, everyone knows
those TRPs are fake.

407
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,457
Who knows where they get
their data from?

408
00:28:56,583 --> 00:29:00,082
Last week you were bloating
about your high TRPs, weren't you?

409
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:04,415
Nandita, they are real
for our sponsors.

410
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:08,374
Fine. What do you want me
to do about it?

411
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,957
The "Sacred Pumpkin"?

412
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:14,374
Whatever it takes
to get the eyeballs.

413
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,624
May be I should go kill someone,
that would get you your eyeballs.

414
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,249
Maybe.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

415
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:26,624
Have you noticed
how much Dhaniya has changed?

416
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:32,290
You've barely mentioned suicide
and see the respect she's giving you.

417
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:37,165
All that is fine, brother,

418
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:40,290
but what good is respect
when I'm dead?

419
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,915
You losing the plot again!

420
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:47,124
If you don't do anything for your family
how will you earn respect?

421
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,707
(Rakesh) Uncle?

422
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,540
Where is the Peepli medical centre?

423
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:17,332
(Shouting) Hey, fatso!

424
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:20,457
Where's the clinic?

425
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:24,499
Are you deaf?

426
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:28,124
Digging for fucking gold, looks like!

427
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:41,082
(Rakesh) What?
The Magistrate will come tomorrow?

428
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,874
(Man) Yes. Why have you come today?

429
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,874
But Mr Tyagi had said today.

430
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:48,749
Who's Tyagi?

431
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:52,915
Bunch of smart arses!

432
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:56,207
Let's get some tea.

433
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:02,790
♪ Been really well rewarded for my love,

434
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:05,332
♪ My beloved has destroyed me ♪

435
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:06,957
God is great.

436
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:09,290
Hi. Give me a pack of cigarettes.

437
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:11,165
Who is supplying the free booze?

438
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:14,082
Election is still far away.

439
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:18,082
I'm going to commit suicide, that's why.

440
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:21,499
That's a new one.
Why will you commit suicide?

441
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:26,499
These days the government gives money
if you commit suicide.

442
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:30,790
It can't provide for the living
so how will it pay for the dead?

443
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:35,082
How will I earn respect
if I don't do anything?

444
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:37,040
Good day.

445
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:40,499
(♪ Continue singing)

446
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:50,665
A SUICIDE ANNOUNCED IN PEEPLI

447
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:55,790
Yes...

448
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,790
Yes, sir.
I have given the orders, sir.

449
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:01,499
He will be arrested.

450
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:04,957
After all, suicide is illegal.

451
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:08,707
Oh!

452
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:12,207
It's election time?

453
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,707
I'll immediately stop the police.

454
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,415
Given the situation, I have three options.

455
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:20,624
Firstly, I can arrest him.

456
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,207
I mean...sorry...

457
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:26,957
Secondly, I can put him
on the Food-for-Work programme.

458
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:30,415
Lastly, I could give him
a Lal Bahadur.

459
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:35,582
I've already sanctioned a Lal Bahadur.

460
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:38,249
Everything is under control, sir.

461
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,124
All necessary steps have been taken.

462
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,415
Yes, sir... Yes, sir.

463
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:44,624
Yes, sir.

464
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,332
Sir, greetings.
Victory to the Nation.

465
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:50,874
Victory to the Nation, sir.

466
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,457
How long have you been
running a newspaper?

467
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:02,415
Stand up!

468
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:06,707
Rakesh reported it, sir.

469
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:08,707
I had to go home.

470
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:13,582
You know, sir, with me around
such a story would never be published.

471
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:16,249
You are in for a...

472
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:18,124
- Cancel. License.
- Yes, sir.

473
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,707
Your newspaper license is cancelled.

474
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,540
Send in the Block Development Officer.

475
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:29,665
"Mr Natha Das Manekpuri

476
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:32,374

00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:35,832

00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:39,207
Some Rakesh's report.

479
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:42,124
Why did Jan Morcha publish this?

00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,832
(Car approaching)

481
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,790
Here they come.

482
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:56,124
Move, move, move!
God is great, brother!

483
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:59,790
Greetings, Bhaiji.

484
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,915
Welcome, Natha.

485
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,540
You're a brave man!

486
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,457
I believe you're giving up your life?

487
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:11,415
Bhaiji, you suggested it.

488
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:12,957
What?

489
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:15,999
Listen! He blames me!

490
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:19,415
Talk back to me, will you?

491
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:21,415
How dare you?

492
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:32,415
After today,
if anyone even thinks of dying

493
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:33,874
I'll skin him alive!

494
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,249
I think they broke my tooth.

495
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:46,624
Don't tell Dhaniya
or she'll break the rest.

496
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:50,915
Who is Natha?

497
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:54,290
- Are you Natha?
- Why?

498
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:55,915
Are you going to commit suicide?

499
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:58,124
No, sir. It's a lie.

500
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,915
Lie? Rakesh?

501
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:03,957
He is Natha.

502
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,165
I spoke to you yesterday, didn't I?

503
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:09,124
He is from the Magistrate's office,
wants to give you something.

504
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,832
I'm not Natha, no matter what.

505
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:13,707
Is one of you committing suicide?

506
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,582
- No, sir.
- Yes, sir.

507
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:18,540
"Yes, sir", "no, sir"?

508
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:24,582
Under the resettlement programme,
in memory of Lal Bahadur Shastri...

509
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,874
...I'm giving you a Lal Bahadur.

510
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:35,415
Take his thumb impression.

511
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:38,624
What are you signing away?

512
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:42,624
What are you selling now?
You've squandered everything!

513
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,957
- Shut up, mother!
- Good-for-nothings!

514
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,707
Fetch the Lal Bahadur.

515
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:59,040
Now you can't commit suicide.

516
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:06,707
What about the money for the fitting?

517
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:11,374
You were about to die.

Hi. I'm good and you?

548
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,665
OK, tell me.

549
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:27,582
But what is the big deal?

550
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:33,290
Yeah, but the thing is
that farmer kind of stories

551
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:35,999
are not exactly my forté,
you know that.

552
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:42,165
Give it to me, yeah.

553
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:44,499
Huh-uh.

554
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:47,957
Can you spell that for me?
Just a second.

00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:10,915
Speaking. Who is this?

559
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:16,249
Madam... Yes, it's me.

Yes, madam, thank you.

00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:28,540
I'll meet you, of course I will.

562
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:32,374

Brother!

00:39:58,291 --> 00:40:01,499
Sandip, cut it out.
Stop that. Enough.

566
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:04,040
(Budhia) What's wrong with you?

567
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:06,582
She is here to ask something.

568
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,207
Hello.

569
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:13,540
I'm Nandita Mallik.
I've come from Delhi to meet you.

570
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:17,082
Nathu, hey...
She's here to take pictures.

571
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,082
Don't be afraid.

572
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,207
Nothing's going to happen.

573
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:23,624
It's just a camera.

574
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,582
It won't harm you.

575
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:28,374
Oh, my God!

576
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,624
Budhia, you're bringing home girls now?

577
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:34,290
Shut up, mother.
She is with the government.

578
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:37,707
Goodness! A government girl?

579
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:40,665
I'm not with the government.

580
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:42,290
I'm from ITVN news channel.

581
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:48,290
Don't be afraid.

582
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:50,999
I'll talk to you later.

583
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,082
Relax.

584
00:40:56,208 --> 00:41:00,374
Just look at me.
Forget the camera, OK?

585
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,582
Mike, please.

586
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:04,707
Where's Rakesh?

587
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:06,999
Rakesh, please get rid of them.

588
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:08,207
Thank you.

589
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,207
Thank you. Please, move.

590
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:11,790
Can I see frame once?

591
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:15,915
Kids, move.
I'll show you the TV later.

592
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:17,790
All right?

593
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:19,749
Yeah, it's good for me.

594
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:22,624
Sound check.

595
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,457
- What's your name?
- (Budhia) Natha Das Manekpuri.

596
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:28,415
Let him speak.

597
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:30,582
There we go for a roll.

598
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:32,332
Roll camera.

599
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:34,040
(Clears throat)

600
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:39,915
Mr Natha, why did you decide
to commit suicide?

601
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:47,249
(Budhia) Don't look at me,
she won't let me talk.

602
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:50,832
'How deep can despair run?

603
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:53,832
'In one absolutely desperate act

604
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:59,249
'Natha Das Mankepuri has shown us
the limits to our security.

605
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:01,165
'And now the question is

606
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:05,290
'will he commit suicide
and condemn us?

607
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:10,665
'Or will this government step in
and save him, in time?

608
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:13,540
'This is Nandita Mallik
in Peepli, for ITVN.'

609
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:17,624
How come we don't have
this farmer suicide story?

610
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,749
But it's an ITVN exclusive, sir.

611
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:23,165
Shut up.
Who is the local reporter?

612
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,790
Fire the local stringer!

613
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:31,540
Deepak, I want this story on prime time
with a live feed.

614
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:34,999
Women reporters should be banned.
It's a non-story.

615
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:37,290
It's a live suicide, my dear.
Unmissable!

616
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:40,915
Listen, sir,
there will be no suicide.

617
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:43,874
Let our scam story break,
then watch the fun.

618
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,499
It'll create havoc!

619
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:48,915
And if Natha kills himself,
the elections will definitely swing.

620
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:51,290
But how? The Yadav caste votes
are with C.M.Yadav.

621
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:53,290
Send an outdoor broadcasting van.

622
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:55,749
A team from Mukhya Pradesh
will camp there.

623
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:58,374
I want updates in every bulletin.

624
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,124
The election will turn.

625
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:04,749
If it doesn't,
we'll still get superb ratings.

626
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:07,290
Now get going. Take charge.

627
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,499
Get me the local stringer.

628
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:18,874
Sir, I'm off, but mark my words
no other channel will do this story.

629
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:21,082
(Nandita) Move ahead.

630
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:24,374
Straight ahead, this way.
Walk on.

631
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,499
Let them feed the goats.

632
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:30,374
Goats don't eat those leaves.

633
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:34,707
This is no good. Do it again.

634
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:37,790
That's it, very good.

635
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,999
Shit!

636
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,832
Hurry up! Attach the mike.

637
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,999
(Reporter) Which one is Natha?

638
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:10,457
(Reporter #2) Why are you
committing suicide?

639
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:20,165
'Natha, who is like a son
or brother for these women'

640
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:23,415
has sadly decided to commit suicide.

641
00:45:23,541 --> 00:45:26,040
Let's ask these women how they feel.

642
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:28,624
Do you think what is happening
to Natha is right?

643
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:31,374
- No.
- So what should the government do?

644
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,957
If he can be saved, that'll be nice.

645
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:38,249
So, as you can see
there is pain, sadness and anguish

646
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,165
over Natha's decision.

647
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:43,457
'You think Natha will actually
commit suicide?'

648
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:45,415
'You bet he will!

649
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:48,582
'I know him. He's a doer!

650
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:51,374
'He'll die, for sure!'

651
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,665
Next, they'll make his mother dance!

652
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:56,290
Yes, sir.

653
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:01,999
Bloody Bhai Thakur!

654
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,624
Always claiming to have
everything under control.

655
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,624
Look at this.

656
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:09,499
Sir, I took action on the very first day.

657
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:11,374
I've already given him a Lal Bahadur.

658
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,915
- Give him an Indira Housing.
- Right, sir.

659
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,249
But it's meant only for the homeless.

660
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,207
Then the Jawahar Employment
Programme.

661
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:22,915
But that's only for the unemployed.

662
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:25,207
At least you can give him
an Annapurna!

663
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:28,165
That's for starvation, sir.

664
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,374
The Gramin Vikas
is for an entire village.

665
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,415
The other government programmes
are Peace and Prosperity,

666
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:38,040
Import-Export, Growth Impetus,
Decelerated Development.

667
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:41,374
Apart from these, there are
no other programmes left, sir.

668
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,915
Then create one!

669
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:46,540
- Do it yourself!
- Right, sir.

670
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,624
Mr Choubey,
keep the media in check.

671
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:52,832
Sure, sir.

672
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:55,374
What are you waiting for? Get lost.

673
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,207
Yes, sir. Good day, sir.

674
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:00,499
Victory to the Nation, sir.

675
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:06,540
Tell us some childhood memories
of Natha.

676
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:12,415
We were always together.
Smoking pot, eating eggs, farming.

677
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:17,707
But this talk of suicide
has shaken me.

678
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:23,040
Smoking pot and eating eggs
will never be the same again.

679
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:24,999
(Reporter) Tragic...

680
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:33,749
Right now we're inside Natha's house.

681
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:39,540
Behind me is his clothesline,
earthen pots, sacks of grain...

682
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:41,415
- Do you go to school?
- I do.

683
00:47:41,541 --> 00:47:45,040
- Which class are you in?
- Class four.

684
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:48,915
- Do you get lunch in school?
- Yes.

685
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:54,874
(Deepak) As you can see, Mr Natha's
mother just made this gesture.

686
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,415
Budhia... Budhia.

687
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,665
Where the hell are you?

688
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:02,249
- Where are you from?
- I'm from TV.

689
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:04,832
- Are you from the bank?
- No, I'm from TV. . .

690
00:48:04,958 --> 00:48:06,790
You've already stolen our land.

691
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:09,499
What are you after now,
the roof over our heads?

692
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:11,957
- Calm her down.
- Mother, calm down.

693
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:16,457
Our house is on fire
and you're asking me to calm down?

694
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:19,249
Leave her. Just be quiet.

695
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,124
As you just saw,
Mr Natha's mother made this sign.

696
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:25,915
This sign could mean only two things.

697
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:31,499
Either she was asking for a cigarette
or else she was begging for peace.

698
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:36,540
Yes, smoking,
which is a road to hell.

699
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:38,624
Slow poison.

701
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:43,915
With a ravaged heart,
she watches her beloved son

702
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:46,749
walking into the jaws of death.

703
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:50,040
Will this helpless old woman
lose the apple of her eye?

704
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:51,999
Or will this sleeping government awaken?

705
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:58,540
Sir, if you're done, please give me the cot.
That lady wants it.

706
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:02,249

I was drawn here
to see this brave young man.

735
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:06,540
This is a time for sacrifice.

736
00:51:07,458 --> 00:51:14,290
Natha's decision has brought
honour to his caste and country.

737
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:19,832
Therefore, on behalf of the backward
caste party, I present this TV.

will not commit suicide.

Who the hell is the Magistrate
to say anything?

745
00:51:54,666 --> 00:51:58,582
Do you think the backward castes
have no feelings? No conscience?

746
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:02,582
If so, then more like Natha shall rise.

This is my CV, for you.

864
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:38,457
It's good...

865
01:00:38,583 --> 01:00:42,124
...but for now, you keep it.
I might lose it.

866
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:46,749
I've done a lot of local coverage...

867
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:49,707
I'll take care of it.

868
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:51,707
I promise to work hard.

869
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:54,082
Where is your focus?

870
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:56,457
On your CV, instead of the story?

871
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:58,332
Sorry, madam.

872
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,582
(Reporter) 'What are your comments
on Natha's decision?

873
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:16,207
'Answer our questions, Bhaiji.'

874
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:18,790
Later...

875
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:29,665
Sir Budhia!
So you finally summoned me.

876
01:01:41,708 --> 01:01:45,499
What are you doing? Sit here.

877
01:01:48,416 --> 01:01:52,457
What a carnival! Amazing!

878
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:56,290
I've never seen
such a grand celebration of death.

879
01:01:56,416 --> 01:02:01,249
Please don't joke, Bhaiji.
We're neck deep in trouble.

880
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:03,499
Trouble hasn't begun for you yet.

881
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:08,790
If Natha doesn't die in the next two days

882
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:12,915
then I'll kill you.

883
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:23,665
They'll leave, eventually.
Then guess who you'll have to deal with.

884
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:24,832
Huh?

885
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:26,457
Me.

886
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:41,582
Move, move.

887
01:02:44,666 --> 01:02:46,332
(Reporter) Bhai Thakur, one question.

888
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:47,707
Well, what?

889
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:50,332
Will Natha commit suicide?
What do you think?

890
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:53,915
(Deepak) What did you tell Budhia?
Please clarify.

891
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:56,790
(Bhai) That's between the two of us.

892
01:02:56,916 --> 01:02:59,415
- You must tell the media.
- Answer the question, please.

893
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:01,957
What should I tell you?

894
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:04,832
What haven't I done for this place?

895
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:07,290
I've opened medical centres,

896
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,749
provided dowry for dozens of girls,

897
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:13,249
paid for many funerals.

898
01:03:13,375 --> 01:03:17,624
In this lovingly nurtured village of mine

899
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:21,832
'politics must not be allowed
to claim lives.

900
01:03:21,958 --> 01:03:26,999
'I have known Natha since he was a kid.

901
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:30,499
'How can I let him die?'

902
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:34,665
Bhaiji, that was wonderful.

903
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:37,124
(Mobile rings)

904
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:40,957
It's the Chief Minister.

905
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:47,665
The C.M. is answerable.

906
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:49,790
What will he do now?

907
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:03,957
Move, get up from here.

908
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:09,124
Go there and play.

909
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:15,707
It's become impossible to move here.

910
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:18,040
Some say live.

911
01:04:18,166 --> 01:04:19,999
Others say die.

912
01:04:20,125 --> 01:04:22,999
Despite this circus, I wonder
if we will get any money.

913
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:25,374
Why won't we?

914
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,374
After all this attention
why won't we?

915
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,249
But he should stay firm.

916
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:34,957
Look at him, sitting like a zombie.

917
01:05:05,208 --> 01:05:07,874
What does he dig all day?

918
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,332
- Hello.
- Hello.

919
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:27,665
What are you doing?

920
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:31,540
Digging earth.

921
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:33,790
What for?

922
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:36,707
To sell.

923
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:42,540
- What's your name?
- Hori Mahato.

924
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:46,915
- Huh?
- Hori Mahato.

925
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:11,707
(Sirens wailing)

926
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:45,124
(Reporter) Why is Pappulal with you,
Mr Yadav?

927
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:52,249
(Reporters ask questions simultaneously)

928
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:29,332
Sir, are you here
because of the upcoming elections?

929
01:07:29,458 --> 01:07:30,790
Do you think...
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

930
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:33,999
Calm down...
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

931
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:40,124
Calm down, listen to what I have to say.

932
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:43,290
As you can see,

933
01:07:43,416 --> 01:07:48,374
we have with us the revered leader
of the backward caste party,

934
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,457
Mr Pappulal.

935
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:53,499
Though we are opponents,

936
01:07:53,625 --> 01:07:55,624
yet he stands with me today.

937
01:07:56,708 --> 01:07:59,707
I am very grateful to him.

938
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:04,957
We are here today
to meet our brother

939
01:08:05,875 --> 01:08:10,957
to humbly request him
to give up his idea of suicide.

940
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:13,749
The Mukhya Pradesh government

941
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:19,707
will grant 1 00,000 rupees
to Mr Natha and his family.

942
01:08:20,458 --> 01:08:23,499
Mr Natha will not commit suicide now.

943
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:26,874
This tantamounts to bribery
how can this be a compensation?

944
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,624
Hear me out fully.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

945
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:33,540

<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

946
01:08:35,916 --> 01:08:37,915

<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

947
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:45,832
Guys, headline changes.
We'll have to re-roll.

948
01:08:45,958 --> 01:08:47,707
Natha will not commit suicide.

949
01:09:02,041 --> 01:09:04,040
As per the Election Code of Conduct

950
01:09:04,166 --> 01:09:08,124
no individual can
be granted special favours.

951
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:15,499
The Chief Minister should accept
moral responsibility and resign.

952
01:09:19,291 --> 01:09:20,832
This is anarchy.

953
01:09:27,416 --> 01:09:29,332
'Good evening.
The headlines for the day.

954
01:09:29,458 --> 01:09:32,999
'The Election Commission cancels
all concessions granted to Natha.

955
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:36,707
'Once again his fate changes.
Natha to die.'

956
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,999
Dad, when will you die?

957
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:53,582
When will you die?

958
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:55,207
Tell me.

959
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,499
Why don't you let me rest in peace?

960
01:10:00,625 --> 01:10:03,457
Uncle says after you die
I'll become a government contractor.

961
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:05,832
Contractor, huh?

962
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:07,374
No, I want to be a cop.

963
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:11,957
Here I'm about to die
and you want to be a cop.

964
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:13,415
I want to be a cop!

965
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,999
You're back?

966
01:10:58,458 --> 01:10:59,957
Go.

967
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:06,457
Go away.

968
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:44,624
Move, it's getting late.

969
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,582
What are you doing here?

970
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:48,624
- I need to go. . .
- Again?

971
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:50,582
We're in a hurry too.

972
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:54,040
- Wait for our shift to change.
- But it's urgent.

973
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:57,415
Then do it right here.

974
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:26,332
Have a heart! It's too early.

975
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:28,207
Let me have some tea first.

976
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:30,874
Climb. I'll pass you the camera.

977
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,499
Can't you find another story?

978
01:12:33,625 --> 01:12:36,874
70% of our country
shits in the open.

979
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,957
It's a sensational exposé.

980
01:12:50,541 --> 01:12:52,040
Careful.

981
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:54,249
Well done.

982
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:00,207
Frame ready?

983
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:04,124
Idiot! They'll finish shitting!

984
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:17,457
Do you see anything?

985
01:13:28,958 --> 01:13:30,499
- Deepak, sir...
- Yes?

986
01:13:30,625 --> 01:13:32,874
- In the field...
- What?

987
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,415
Natha alone.

988
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:37,957
- What's he doing?
- Shitting.

989
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:40,165
Keep rolling.

990
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:45,124
Ali, come fast.

991
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:49,832
Natha spotted.

992
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:54,874
(Deepak) Come down!

993
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,999
Where did he go?

994
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:05,415
Hurry up! Jump!

995
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:22,374
(Nandita) You are a cop and you
don't know? What were you doing?

996
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,499
(Policeman) I had gone for a shit
and was walking back.

997
01:14:25,625 --> 01:14:28,665
Everyone was running so I ran too.

998
01:14:28,791 --> 01:14:32,624
- Who was running and where?
- Everyone, madam, everywhere.

999
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:35,457
- What happened to Natha?
- Don't know, he ran away.

1000
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:37,165
- What?
- Yes!

1001
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:41,207
The media is out in full force.
The police have taken positions.

1002
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:44,040
This is an absolutely
shocking turn of events.

1003
01:14:44,166 --> 01:14:46,665
Natha Das Manekpuri has gone missing.

1004
01:14:46,791 --> 01:14:49,790
Is it a political conspiracy?
Or was Natha under pressure?

1005
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:52,790
Is this police negligence?

1006
01:14:52,916 --> 01:14:55,582
Will he or will he not commit suicide...

1007
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:58,457
Hello. Hello.
Yadav calling, sir.

1008
01:14:58,583 --> 01:15:00,415
Nobody has a clue
as to where he is.

1009
01:15:00,541 --> 01:15:03,749
More importantly,
has he changed his mind?

1010
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:08,832
Natha missing. Is he dead or alive?

1011
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:12,332
Only C.M. Yadav can tell us
where Natha is.

1012
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:14,332
Missing? Or forced to disappear?

1013
01:15:14,458 --> 01:15:16,665
We are waiting
for the High Court orders.

1014
01:15:16,791 --> 01:15:20,749
What does this say
about safety in Mukhya Pradesh?

1015
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:22,332
We'll investigate.

1016
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:24,082
People go missing!

1017
01:15:24,208 --> 01:15:26,124
We'll find Natha within 72 hours.

1018
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:28,040
We are waiting
for the High Court orders.

1019
01:15:28,166 --> 01:15:32,040
1 8% people feel Natha has run away,

1020
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:36,749
49% think Natha has succeeded
in his mission,

1021
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:40,665
1 4% blame Islamic terrorists,

1022
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:42,624
6% blame left wing extremists

1023
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:45,165
and 7% hold America responsible.

1024
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:49,915
All Communist parties strongly condemn
the State and Federal Government.

1025
01:15:50,041 --> 01:15:56,374
Unemployment, starvation, poverty,
America and all other issues.

1026
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,332
We are waiting
for the High Court orders.

1027
01:15:58,458 --> 01:16:04,540
If you look closely
you'll see Natha's footprints.

1028
01:16:04,666 --> 01:16:07,540
Whether escape or abduction,

1029
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:10,499
here's where Natha perched himself
for the last time.

1030
01:16:10,625 --> 01:16:12,874
And here's the fruit of his toil,
his faeces,

1031
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,124
commonly known as shit.

1032
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:18,915
Take a close look.

1033
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:21,165
Do not cringe at the sight,

1034
01:16:21,291 --> 01:16:25,290
for, as long as we live,
we will continue to shit.

1035
01:16:25,416 --> 01:16:31,040
Psychiatrists claim that faeces
reflect our mental state.

1036
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:35,582
The complexion of our shit
is a window to the inner self.

1037
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:38,707
But here we see
a mixture of hues.

1038
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:41,040
Therefore, before reaching
any conclusions

1039
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:46,249
we need to bring in experts
as Mr Natha was no ordinary man.

1040
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:49,290
For Bharat Live this is Kumar Deepak
live from Peepli.

1041
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:10,957
I feel we have to do something, sir.

1042
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:13,874
Law suits have been filed.

1043
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,749
Sir, these Central Government schemes
do not cover farmers who are still alive.

1044
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:21,707
Our schemes cover only those
who are already dead.

1045
01:17:24,541 --> 01:17:29,290
Try this. Launch a programme,
the Natha Card Programme.

1046
01:17:29,416 --> 01:17:32,124
Dedicated to Natha.

1047
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:35,957
This card will be given to families
below the poverty line

1048
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:39,124
or whose members
wish to commit suicide.

1049
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:40,707
But we can't afford that.

1050
01:17:41,416 --> 01:17:43,415
70% of our population is farmers

1051
01:17:43,541 --> 01:17:46,749
and at least half of them
are below the poverty line.

1052
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:49,165
We don't have funds for it.

1053
01:17:49,291 --> 01:17:51,040
We're merely making
the announcement.

1054
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:54,332
Implementation is the problem
of the State Governments.

1055
01:17:55,708 --> 01:17:58,707
Damned if they do,
damned if they don't.

1056
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:00,832
Let the music begin.

1057
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:11,374
Hey?

1058
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:17,749
Wearing father's sweater again?

1059
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:19,207
(Sobs)

1060
01:18:22,291 --> 01:18:24,582
Why are you hitting him?

1061
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:26,207
All your fault.

1062
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:27,915
You started this whole thing.

1063
01:18:30,625 --> 01:18:32,540
You think he's dead?

1064
01:18:34,583 --> 01:18:39,624
Even if the God of Death himself
came to fetch him, he won't go.

1065
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:42,165
He must be hiding somewhere.

1066
01:18:43,583 --> 01:18:45,415
Left us in a lurch.

1067
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:49,582
The government says you get no money
until you produce the corpse.

1068
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:51,249
Happy now?

1069
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:55,832
I've three children.
How do I provide for them?

1070
01:18:55,958 --> 01:18:58,332
Go on, you slut!

1071
01:18:58,458 --> 01:19:00,999
Gobble him up too,
swallow him up!

1072
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:02,457
You keep shut.

1073
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:06,249
Had it not been for your medicines,
we'd have never taken the loan.

1074
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:09,915
(Amma) Look! Now she is cursing me.

1075
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:11,540
I've had enough.

1076
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:17,499
Now you put in an application to die.

1077
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:19,124
Are you mad?

1078
01:19:20,166 --> 01:19:23,374
- My death will bring nothing.
- Of course it will!

1079
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:26,165
By now even I know that.

1080
01:19:26,291 --> 01:19:29,457
If you die,
your mother gets the money.

1081
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:34,332
- Don't talk rot.
- I'm not.

1082
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:38,749
Take this sheet,
lie down and die!

1083
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:43,874
God! This witch will kill him too.

1084
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:48,332
You luckless whore, sorceress, witch.

1085
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:50,457
I curse you to death!

1086
01:20:06,791 --> 01:20:09,790
- What happened?
- Hori died.

1087
01:20:12,166 --> 01:20:14,040
- The one who used to dig?
- Yes.

1088
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:17,749
- How?
- He was weak to begin with.

1089
01:20:17,875 --> 01:20:20,665
And then, the hard labour.

1090
01:20:20,791 --> 01:20:23,290
He was found dead in his pit.

1091
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:38,249
With me is Ms Biniya, who is from
Natha's wife side of the family.

1092
01:21:39,125 --> 01:21:43,874
Can you tell us where Natha could be?

1093
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:48,415
Do you know if he is alive?

1094
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:51,165
(Baby cries)

1095
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:56,207
This is not working, Sandip.

1096
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:59,790
Rakesh...
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1097
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:01,915
Where are you?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1098
01:22:06,083 --> 01:22:08,374
Tell me, how hard is it
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1099
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,582
to find one decent person
I can talk to, huh?

1100
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:17,915
Why is Natha so important to us?

1101
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:22,082
Natha...
You're talking about Natha?

1102
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:28,249
OK...

1103
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:35,124
A farmer is committing suicide
because he's in debt.

1104
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,665
You don't think that's important?

1105
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:43,832
Yes, it's important. But there
are other farmers too in this village.

1106
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:45,624
Aren't they equally important?

1107
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:49,082
You don't just abandon
a story midway, Rakesh,

1108
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:51,165
and move on to something else. No.

1109
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:54,040
You've got to follow it
right to it's conclusion.

1110
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:02,457
There was a farmer in this village
called Hori Mahato.

1111
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:05,957
His farm had been auctioned.

1112
01:23:06,958 --> 01:23:12,999
So he used to dig up earth
from fallow land and sell it.

1113
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:17,124
For his labour,
he made about 20 rupees.

1114
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:18,665
What's your point, Rakesh?

1115
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:26,999
He was found dead in his own pit.

1116
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:29,540
People say he died of hunger.
Is this not important?

1117
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:32,540
Fine, if it makes you happy,

1118
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:35,249
we'll send a reporter,
we'll do an entire feature on him.

1119
01:23:35,375 --> 01:23:37,207
But he's dead.

1120
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:40,082
Let me try and explain this to you.

1121
01:23:42,416 --> 01:23:45,915
Research shows our audience
is interested only in Natha.

1122
01:23:46,041 --> 01:23:48,457
Do you know why?

1123
01:23:48,583 --> 01:23:51,207
Because he is
the original live suicider.

1124
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:54,749
Do you have any idea
how big this is?

1125
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:58,040
Would finding Natha
solve all problems?

1126
01:24:02,291 --> 01:24:04,707
No. No.

1127
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:08,040
No solution is going to be found.

1128
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:14,499
Some people choose to become doctors,
some engineers.

1129
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:18,207
We're journalists
and this is what we do.

1130
01:24:19,541 --> 01:24:22,082
If you can't handle this

1131
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:25,249
then you're in the wrong profession.

1132
01:25:14,708 --> 01:25:16,415
Hey, Natha!

1133
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:18,040
Natha?

1134
01:25:18,791 --> 01:25:21,207
Hey, Natha!

1135
01:25:24,416 --> 01:25:26,082
What's up?

1136
01:25:26,208 --> 01:25:27,957
What's happening?

1137
01:25:37,791 --> 01:25:39,665
Eat.

1138
01:25:39,791 --> 01:25:41,749
'The government has launched
a new programme

1139
01:25:41,875 --> 01:25:43,624
'dedicated to Natha Das Manekpuri.

1140
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:49,582
'Farmers desiring to commit suicide
will be given a Natha Card.

1141
01:25:49,708 --> 01:25:54,249
'More than 65,000 farmers
have already applied for this card.'

1142
01:25:54,375 --> 01:25:57,915
Bhaiji, take my advice.

1143
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:01,540
Let's strike a deal with Mr Salim
and give Natha to him.

1144
01:26:01,666 --> 01:26:05,457
That will put C.M. and Pappulal in a fix.

1145
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:08,915
You're right, Gudda.

1146
01:26:09,041 --> 01:26:15,540
No, Mr Salim,
this has nothing to do with money.

1147
01:26:15,666 --> 01:26:17,665
It's about honour.

1148
01:26:19,333 --> 01:26:20,999
Yes, I'll give you Natha.

1149
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:24,957
Then you decide whether
you want murder or suicide.

1150
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,624
Welcome, please come.

1151
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:32,832
All of Peepli will be at your service.

1152
01:26:38,208 --> 01:26:40,374
Mr Salim, you're a man of style.

1153
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:44,290
You have brought glamour
to even the Agriculture Ministry.

1154
01:26:46,541 --> 01:26:52,665
Your true fan is me.
Leave your party and join us.

1155
01:26:57,166 --> 01:26:59,665
Very well.

1156
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:06,124
Bhai Thakur, that scoundrel!

1157
01:27:06,916 --> 01:27:09,749
Playing games with me!

1158
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:13,374
Mr Salim had recommended
an American company.

1159
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:17,290
What was it called? Sonmanto?

1160
01:27:17,416 --> 01:27:18,749
Yes.

1161
01:27:18,875 --> 01:27:22,040
Give them all the government contracts
for seeds.

1162
01:27:22,166 --> 01:27:24,707
- But sir. . .
- Do as you're told.

1163
01:27:24,833 --> 01:27:25,832
Yes, sir.

1164
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:29,040
Organise a press conference tonight.

1165
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:31,832
In Peepli.

1166
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:41,624
Welcome, Rakesh sir.
How are you?

1167
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:44,749
Your shop is going well.

1168
01:27:44,875 --> 01:27:46,874
All thanks to you.

1169
01:27:47,708 --> 01:27:50,999
- How about some food?
- Right away.

1170
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:52,874
Boy, set a plate.

1171
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,457
In a minute. Let me first
pack Gudda Babu's dinner.

1172
01:27:56,583 --> 01:28:00,374
What's up? Has Gudda Babu
stopped going home?

1173
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,374
He's ordering a take-away every night.

1174
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:05,957
- He's at the warehouse these days.
- I see.

1175
01:28:11,625 --> 01:28:13,124
Come quickly!

1176
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:20,082
Wait, Mr Rakesh, it's done.

1177
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:28,165
Get up! We're taking you home.

1178
01:28:28,291 --> 01:28:30,415
I don't want to, I'm OK here.

1179
01:28:30,541 --> 01:28:33,957
But we aren't OK with that.
Let go.

1180
01:28:35,416 --> 01:28:39,165
Gudda Babu, get him off me.

1181
01:28:39,291 --> 01:28:42,957
Hey, listen Natha.

1182
01:28:46,083 --> 01:28:50,082
- We all have to return home, my dear.
- But I don't want to. I'm fine here.

1183
01:28:51,166 --> 01:28:53,624
Don't! No marks.

1184
01:29:00,833 --> 01:29:03,415
Are you sure about this?

1185
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:05,040
Yes.

1186
01:29:05,958 --> 01:29:06,957
Warehouse...

1187
01:29:07,083 --> 01:29:08,582
OK.

1188
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:40,915
Sir, all the reporters have arrived.

1189
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:43,874
We're getting late
for the press conference.

1190
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:47,540
Call Salim.

1191
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:50,415
I'm sure Nandita has got a lead.

1192
01:29:50,541 --> 01:29:52,790
I'm following her.

1193
01:29:58,125 --> 01:29:59,999
Faster.

1194
01:30:01,958 --> 01:30:04,832
Faster! They're on our backs.

1195
01:30:07,166 --> 01:30:09,624
Mr Salim is getting upset
about Natha not appearing.

1196
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:13,665
Why isn't Gudda answering the phone?
Lethargic slob.

1197
01:30:19,625 --> 01:30:21,832
Choubey, all of you go to Peepli.

1198
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:23,707
- Check what's up.
- OK, sir.

1199
01:30:28,291 --> 01:30:32,457
You guys are no good either.
Couldn't arrange for a light?

1200
01:30:32,583 --> 01:30:35,499
- We've got a petromax lamp.
- Then why haven't you lit it, moron?

1201
01:30:41,791 --> 01:30:43,832
Why haven't you lit the petromax?

1202
01:30:45,916 --> 01:30:49,707
- Where's the oil?
- Haven't put the oil in, motherfuckers?

1203
01:31:06,458 --> 01:31:07,957
Stop!

1204
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,582
Jugan, stay inside.

1205
01:31:18,208 --> 01:31:20,499
- You left Natha unguarded?
- He won't run away.

1206
01:31:20,625 --> 01:31:24,165
- Morons! Where is Natha?
- In there.

1207
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:27,624
(Nandita) Don't argue with me.
Just come on. I know this is it.

1208
01:31:30,375 --> 01:31:31,374
This is it.

1209
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,707
We just have to find that damn Rakesh.
Where the hell is he?

1210
01:31:33,833 --> 01:31:34,832
(Car door slams)

1211
01:31:34,958 --> 01:31:36,457
Deepak...

1212
01:31:58,708 --> 01:32:02,499
Sir, we've arrived.
I'll keep you informed.

1213
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:06,374
It's so dark, I can't see anything.

1214
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:08,832
- Why didn't you bring a torch?
- Sir, I'm new on the job.

1215
01:32:08,958 --> 01:32:11,582
You should be transferred back.

1216
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:13,790
Where's he?

1217
01:32:13,916 --> 01:32:15,749
Let's check in here.

1218
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,624
- Hurry up!
- Yes, sir, I'm lighting it.

1219
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:29,915
Faster!

1220
01:32:30,041 --> 01:32:33,332
Sir, where are you? I've arrived.

1221
01:32:33,458 --> 01:32:36,415
What an idiot this B.D.O. is.

1222
01:32:36,541 --> 01:32:39,540
D.M.? What is he doing here?
Roll camera.

1223
01:32:39,666 --> 01:32:41,499
D.M. sir, why are you here?

1224
01:32:42,541 --> 01:32:45,207
Stop spilling it.

1225
01:32:45,333 --> 01:32:48,332
You know exactly what is going on.
Who is on the inside here?

1226
01:32:48,458 --> 01:32:49,624
Interviewing on the sly!

1227
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:51,249
What the hell are you doing here?

1228
01:32:51,375 --> 01:32:52,874
You left the press conference
to report on the sly?

1229
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,999
Will you stop following me and let me
do my job and go find your damn story?

1230
01:33:00,833 --> 01:33:02,582
Sir? Sir?

1231
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:37,957
(Nandita) The Chief Minister had called
for a conference to be held at 9pm.

1232
01:33:38,083 --> 01:33:39,249
An accident took place.

1233
01:33:39,375 --> 01:33:42,165
Yes, we have confirmed reports
that indeed there was an accident

1234
01:33:42,291 --> 01:33:44,290
and yes, there has been one casualty.

1235
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:47,790
Now, news has been trickling in
that Natha could've been at that site.

1236
01:33:47,916 --> 01:33:50,749
We don't have any official confirmation
on this as of yet.

1237
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:52,957
We are still trying to ascertain...

1238
01:33:53,083 --> 01:33:58,332
(Deepak) It is now confirmed
that the burnt body

1239
01:33:58,458 --> 01:34:05,332
is of Natha Das Manekpuri.

1240
01:34:05,458 --> 01:34:08,165
Yes, Natha is dead.

1241
01:34:08,291 --> 01:34:12,874
How ironic that Natha died
in an accident.

1242
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,457
Neither suicide, nor murder.

1243
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:21,374
Fate denied this poor soul even
his last wish to commit suicide.

1244
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:24,332
A resilient farmer is now dead.

1245
01:34:24,458 --> 01:34:26,832
A farmer who was alive is now dead.

1246
01:34:26,958 --> 01:34:30,499
This night will weigh heavily on India.

1247
01:34:30,625 --> 01:34:35,040
A dark night indeed for India.

1248
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:53,665
Hurry up. The village picnic is over.
Let's move.

1249
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:55,915
I have a simple rule.

1250
01:34:56,041 --> 01:34:59,415
- Stretch a story only so far.
- Of course.

1251
01:34:59,541 --> 01:35:03,165
- It's so easy to be sensational.
- Sir, is truly different.

1252
01:35:59,708 --> 01:36:02,457
- Have you seen Rakesh anywhere?
- No.

1253
01:36:03,166 --> 01:36:06,915
He's not answering his phone...
Let's go.

1254
01:37:58,875 --> 01:38:00,874
What happened today?

1255
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:03,749
Nothing.

1256
01:38:05,708 --> 01:38:07,207
Why?

1257
01:38:08,583 --> 01:38:12,540
You said everything would be sorted
after the post-mortem report.

1258
01:38:13,666 --> 01:38:15,165
Yes...

1259
01:38:16,208 --> 01:38:18,207
...but now they say...

1260
01:38:20,166 --> 01:38:22,457
...it was an accident, not a suicide.

1261
01:38:22,583 --> 01:38:24,832
So no compensation.

1262
01:38:25,958 --> 01:38:28,332
What about the Natha Card?

1263
01:38:28,958 --> 01:38:31,457
We don't have
a Below Poverty Line card.

1264
01:38:32,375 --> 01:38:37,040
To prove we're poor
the government gives a B.P.L. card.

1265
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,665
We need that for a Natha card.

1266
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:44,957
Three months have gone by in all this.

1267
01:38:48,083 --> 01:38:50,582
He lost his life...

1268
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:54,582
...and you couldn't even manage
a poverty card.
