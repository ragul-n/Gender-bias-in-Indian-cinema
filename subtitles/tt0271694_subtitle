Cover it.

18
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,600
Where is the FIR?

19
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,320
Who had informed the police?

20
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,720
He is right here.
- Bring him in.

21
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,440
And you are? - I am
Mr. Ouseppachan's son-in-law.

22
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,200
What is your name?
- Johny. - Please come.

23
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,440
This is Mr. Ouseppachan.
He is Omana's father-in-law.

24
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,840
This is Sunny,
her husband.

25
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,640
This is Mr. Narayanan.
A social worker.

26
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,400
Where is the way to the terrace?
- It's right inside, sir.

27
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,680
This way.

28
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,880
Shall I hold the inquest, sir?
- Okay.

29
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,640
My dear! - Sister! - My dear
daughter! - Please, don't touch.

30
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,480
What is this?
Please get up.

31
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,280
Don't touch the body.
Move aside.

32
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,880
Yes, please move.
- My dear daughter.

33
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,040
Oh, dear Lord!
My dear!

34
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,880
Who are they?

35
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,280
Sir, they are
Omana's father and sister. - Okay.

36
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,280
Show them the body.

37
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,200
Omana!
- Oh, God!

38
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,440
My dear daughter!
- Father!

39
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,760
Father!
- My dear.

40
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,320
Oh, God!

41
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,800
Sister!

42
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,160
Cover it.

43
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,320
You may take the dead body.
- Okay. Let's go.

44
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,640
'I am the RMO from
General Hospital, Trivandrum.'

Omana was performed under the case'

Kumarapuram village police office.'

48
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,280
'As per the results, injuries were
found only on the head and neck.'

49
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,280

fall is the cause of death.'

50
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,840
'The autopsy was performed on the
body after 15 hours of her death.'

51
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,320
'During the examination, there
were no signs of manhandling.'

52
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,200
'The post-mortem certificate
will be delivered.'

53
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,240
Mr. Thomachan.

54
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,720
It's been many days.

55
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,240
But you're still..

56
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,240
The DYSP is inside.

57
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,720
Sunny, please eat something.

58
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,080
Please come.

59
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,560
I don't want anything.
- Sunny.

60
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,680
We need you downstairs.

61
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,600
Take a seat.

62
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,000
Don't you wear a watch, Sunny?
- No.

63
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,960
How long have you been married?
- Four years.

64
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,600
Were the two of you happy during
the initial years? - Yes.

65
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,640
Are you saying that
you had no conflicts? - No.

66
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,680
No arguments at all?

67
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,280
Sometimes.
- When?

68
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,080
We used to have
petty arguments.

69
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,720
Did it happen on the day she died?

70
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,160
Yes.
- Why? What was the reason?

71
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,280
I have the habit
of drinking alcohol.

72
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,760
She was against my drinking.

73
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,680
I hope you remember what
happened that day.

74
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,960
Tell us.

75
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,720
Where are you going?
- Why do you want to know?

76
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,600
Aren't you going to drink?
- Yes.

77
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,000
The doctor had advised
you to not drink.

78
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,280
He will say a lot of things.

79
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,520
Move! - If you want,
you can sit and drink here.

80
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,480
I will decide that.
Move aside.

81
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,480
No, I won't allow you to leave.

82
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,000
Who are you to decide that?

83
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,840
Move aside!

84
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,920
When she didn't allow you to leave,
you used force..

85
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,320
No, sir.
Nothing of that sort had happened.

86
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,320
Haven't you ever
hurt her physically?

87
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,880
No, sir. I have never
tried to hurt her by any means.

88
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,160
I find it difficult to believe you.

89
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,160
Do you believe that
it's a case of suicide?

90
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,320
I cannot think of any other reason.

91
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,160
Do you suspect anyone?
- No, sir.

92
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,800
Did she ever tell you anything
about committing suicide?

93
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,440
Tell me. - She had once tried
to commit suicide.

94
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,800
We were able to save her as we
took her to the hospital on time.

95
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,960
When did that happen?

96
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,920
Five months ago.
When I returned from work

97
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,800
she was unconscious after
consuming sleeping pills.

98
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,800
I was able to save her
because I reached on time.

99
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,960
Didn't you ask her the reason
for taking such a drastic step?

100
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,640
I asked her many times.
She never gave a reasonable reply.

101
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,040
What do you mean? - She would
try to change the topic.

102
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,160
Interesting.

103
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,560
You don't know the reason why your
wife tried to kill herself, is it?

104
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,000
You didn't try to find the reason,
is it?

105
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,600
Tell me!
- She couldn't conceive a child.

106
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,120
She was depressed about it.

107
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,960
Who told you?
- Dr. Mohandas, a psychiatrist.

108
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,960
Will a psychiatrist decide
if she could conceive or not?

109
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,280
It was a gynecologist
who told us about it.

110
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,760
Was she mentally ill?

111
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,400
She used to get badly
depressed at times.

112
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,320
She never used to talk to anyone.
So, we consulted Dr. Mohandas.

113
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,280
What did he tell you?

114
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,280
He said that she was
depressed about not conceiving

115
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,520
and that she would feel better
after the treatment.

116
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,800
Did you inform the police about
her suicide attempt? - No, sir.

117
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,600
A suicide attempt is a punishable
offense.

118
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,160
Trying to hide it is also
a punishable offence.

119
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,440
Are you aware of it?
- Yes.

120
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,040
Then why didn't you
inform the police?

121
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,160
I was worried about
the humiliation.

122
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,840
Is it? So, you're worried
about getting humiliated.

123
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,200
Is there a humiliating reason
behind her death as well?

124
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,280
I meant, anything which
couldn't be made public. - No, sir.

125
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,440
When did you go out that day?

126
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,200
Around 8 p.m.
- You never wear a watch.

127
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,320
Then how can you
say it so precisely?

128
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,760
Well, everyday at that time..
- At that time?

129
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
At that time..
- Tell me.

130
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,080
At that time, the siren at
Kamala Tile Factory used to ring.

131
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,200
You were about to say
something else. - No, sir.

132
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
No! - I swear.
No.

133
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,800
You can leave.

134
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,080
Sir, if we threaten him a bit more.
He will spill all the truth. - No.

135
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,680
He is only going to lie
to all our questions.

136
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,800
He is prepared for that.
- Yes, sir.

137
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,080
Call Ouseppachan.

138
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,280
Ouseppachan, please come inside.

139
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,520
At what time did you
reach home that day?

140
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,400
Around 10 to 10:30 at night.
- Is it 10 or 10:30?

141
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,080
I don't remember the exact time.

142
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,520
Mr. Ouseppachan,
where did you go that day?

143
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,960
Ernakulam.
- Why?

144
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,560
For a business purpose.
- Who accompanied you?

145
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,600
My manager, Mr. Mathayi
and our driver, Vasu.

146
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,160
Was your manager with
you when you returned home?

147
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,760
No, I dropped him off at his house.

148
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,240
You saw the dead body first, right?
- Yes.

149
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,440
Can you explain how?

150
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,360
Sir, can I leave? - Okay, come
early in the morning.

151
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,360
Yes, sir.

152
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,400
Sunny.
Omana.

153
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,880
Idiot!
How can he sleep like this?

154
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,200
Sunny!

155
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,400
Sunny!

156
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,120
Sunny!

157
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,600
They won't even know if a
burglar breaks into the house.

158
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,960
Omana!

159
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,800
Sunny!

160
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,760
Sunny!

161
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,160
Omana!

162
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,080
Omana!

163
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,800
Why did you go to the backyard?

164
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,080
To call the servant.

165
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,160
She used to sleep in that house.
- Why?

166
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,920
Didn't she hear you shouting
for Sunny and Omana?

167
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,080
She cannot hear properly.
- Is she deaf?

168
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,560
She can hear only
if we speak too loudly.

169
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,960
So, is she the only servant
you have in this house?

170
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,280
I have a manager.

171
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,640
Also, there is another servant
who works in the daytime.

172
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,520
Where is that manager?
Does he stay here?

173
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,160
No, he stays at his house.

174
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,120
Where is it?
- It's nearby.

175
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,400
At what time did he leave
for home that day?

176
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,840
I had told you earlier that he was
with me when we went to Ernakulam.

177
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,080
I had dropped him home
on our way back.

178
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,600
Do you drink alcohol?
- Yes.

179
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,760
You were completely drunk
on that day, isn't it? - No.

180
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,480
Was your driver with you when
you first saw the dead body?

181
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,920
No, he left immediately
after giving me the key.

182
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,360
Isn't Vasu your henchman?

183
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,560
No, he is not a hooligan.

184
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,520
There are a lot of cases registered
against him for hooliganism.

185
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,640
I am not aware of it.

186
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,880
Is he a well-built person?
- Yes.

187
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,760
So, is he capable of throwing
someone from the terrace?

188
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
I don't know, sir.

189
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,800
What did you do after
seeing the dead body?

190
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,160
I called the servant.

191
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,080
Did she hear you? - No, I had
to keep calling her. She is deaf.

192
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,400
She opened the door for you
and you went inside the house.

193
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,280
What happened then?
- I was looking for Sunny.

194
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,840
I tried calling Johny
because I couldn't find Sunny.

195
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
How did you know that
Sunny was with Johny?

196
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,760
Johny is my son-in-law.

197
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,800
Sunny would never go anywhere else.

198
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,720
You can leave.

199
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,960
Give me a cigarette.

200
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,120
Why are you shivering?
Don't worry.

201
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,360
What is your name?
- What?

202
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,440
What is your name?

203
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,960
What is your name?

204
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,720
Name? I have been given the same
name as the mother of the Lord.

205
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,080
Mary.

206
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,640
How long have you been here?
- Age?

207
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,200
I was told that I was born
during the floods of '99.

208
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,120
Isn't it, sir?
How long have you been..

209
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,400
No, Alex.

210
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,840
Were Sunny and Omana in
good terms with each other?

211
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,560
Were Sunny and Omana in
good terms with each other?

212
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,360
I can hear you.
Stop shouting.

213
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,080
I am not deaf.

214
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,160
Then tell us.

215
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,400
Were Sunny and Omana in
good terms with each other?

216
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,160
Omana was such a good human being.

217
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,200
She used to treat me
like her own mother.

218
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,960
I don't know what
made her take this drastic step.

219
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,680
To commit suicide by
jumping from the building.

220
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,480
I couldn't eat anything

221
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,200
the whole day after
I heard about her death.

222
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,400
She used to pay me
every month an extra

223
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,600
Rs. 25 apart from the
salary given to me.

224
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,000
Who will pay me that extra
amount from now?

225
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,480
Go inside.

226
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,360
Chacko, tell everyone else to meet
me at the guest house. - Yes, sir.

227
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,000
Mr. Alex, have a seat.
- Sir.

228
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,560
I told them exactly
what you said I should say.

229
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,480
Okay,
you can go.

230
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,200
Alex, I will see you in the office.
- Sir.

231
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,520
I came to know that Mr. Varma
is a good man.

232
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,160
He has solved many famous cases.

233
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,920
You don't know.

234
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,280
Ouseppachan has money, influence
and supporters.

235
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,840
He can bribe anyone
with his money.

236
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,800
But what can we do?

237
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,040
We should directly hand over
our petition to Mr. Varma.

238
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,280
And the copies should be sent
to the IG and the Home Minister.

239
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,280
We can also send a copy to the news
reporters.

240
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,440
Let it get published
in the newspaper as well.

241
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,720
It has already been published.

242
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,080
It was also there in today's
newspaper.

243
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,600
Thomachan, let us meet Mr. Varma
and submit the petition tomorrow.

244
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,560
Call him.

245
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,560
Is anyone there?

246
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,280
Hey, open the door.
- I will not. Open it yourself.

247
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,000
Just go! Tell them that I am
not feeling well.

248
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,680
Such a trouble!
- Go!

249
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,040
Where is Sreedharan?
- He is inside.

250
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,200
DySP Varma is in his guest house.

251
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,440
He has asked Sreedharan
to go there.

252
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,880
He is not feeling well.

253
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,520
DySP has called him!
Just drag him out!

254
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,720
What is it? - You have been
asked to accompany them.

255
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,600
It seems the DySP is waiting
in his guest house.

256
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Didn't I tell you?
- Wait a minute.

257
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,760
Don't open your mouth
unnecessarily.

258
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,240
If they ask something,
just don't answer to the point.

259
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,680
We are their tenants.

260
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,840
Don't say things that might
put us in trouble.

261
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
Okay?
- Yeah, right!

262
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,440
So, according to you, Omana's death
was suicide, right?

263
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,200
I believe so, sir.

264
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,560
Then you must have a reason
as well.

265
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,320
After knowing that she could not
conceive

266
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,160
Omana was a bit hysteric.

267
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,200
Whenever she came to my house

268
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,320
she used to cry at the sight
of my grandchildren.

269
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,840
That depression would have
led to her suicide.

270
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,560
Okay. You can leave, Narayanan.

271
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,680
Call Mathai inside.
- Yes, sir.

272
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,920
What happened, sir?

273
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,800
Who is Mathai?
- It's me. - Come inside.

274
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,200
What is your name?
- Mathai.

275
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,880
How long have you been
with Ouseppachan?

276
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,560
It's been around seven years.

277
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,480
What were you doing before that?
- I was into farming.

278
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,200
Tell me the truth.
What happened that night?

279
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,360
I don't know anything, sir.

280
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,360
Boss had dropped me at my house
that night.

281
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,440
I got to know about
Ms. Omana's death the next morning.

282
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,080
What was the time when you were
dropped at your house?

283
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,560
Around 9.30 p.m.

284
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,440
Approximately how far is your house
from that of your boss?

285
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,960
About ten minutes.. - By walk?
- Yes.

286
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,360
Then it would take lesser time
by car. - Yes.

287
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,240
But according to Ouseppachan,
he reached home at 10 p.m.

288
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,320
If he said so,
it must be right.

289
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,080
Maybe it was around 10 p.m.
when he dropped me at home.

290
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,960
What exactly do you know?

291
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,600
Please spare me, sir.
I am a heart patient.

292
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,280
You are not supposed to leave
this place. - Okay.

293
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,360
You should be here whenever
summoned. - Sure, sir.

294
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,280
You can leave.
- Okay.

295
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,680
Call Sreedharan.
- Yes, sir. - Okay.

296
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,760
Sreedharan! Come on.
- Go in.

297
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,560
Where do you work?
- In the brick factory.

298
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,720
You are Ouseppachan's neighbour,
right? - Yes.

299
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,040
On that day, did you hear some
unusual noise

300
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,600
or sound from their house?

301
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,920
I did not hear anything unusual.

302
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,280
But I heard a loud thud at around
10.30 p.m.

303
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,200
Didn't you go and check it out?

304
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,360
I thought it was a coconut.

305
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,000
But I realised things only
the next morning.

306
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,040
How is Sunny as a person?
- He is a good man.

307
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,200
But only till he gets drunk.

308
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,360
I have even heard him
shout at his wife

309
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,800
after getting drunk.

310
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,320
Have you seen him beating her?

311
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,360
How is that possible, sir?

312
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,960
From my house, I cannot see
what happens there.

313
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,080
But I have heard her shouting
and crying.

314
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,240
How is Ouseppachan as a person?

315
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,360
He is a selfish business man.

316
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,120
He earned so much money in
a short span of time.

317
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,320
People say that he acquired
Mr. Thomachan's

318
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,840
illegally by cheating him.

319
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,640
Are you not saying these out
of jealousy?

320
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,760
Definitely not.

321
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,120
What about his behaviour?
Does he have any bad habits?

322
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,240
It has been 15 years since
his wife passed away.

323
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,120
But he still leads a happy life.

324
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,560
Ouseppachan has got many
secret affairs here.

325
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,280
Anyway, what about Johny?

326
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,920
Are you talking about Ouseppachan's
son-in-law?

327
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,040
As far as I know,
he is a gentleman.

328
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,400
He is the one who handles
the business of Ouseppachan.

329
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,080
Is what you said true?
- Yes, sir.

330
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,240
But none should know that I have
told you all these.

331
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,960
My wife had warned me not
to open my mouth.

332
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,560
But I could not lie to you.

333
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,840
Stop there!

334
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,280
We need to meet Mr. Varma.

335
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,960
He is busy.
- We need to speak to him.

336
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,120
I can't allow you inside.
You need to have permission.

337
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,760
But we need to go inside.
- Stop there!

338
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,480
Babu! - Yes, sir?
- Send them inside. - You can go.

339
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,120
What is the matter?
- Sir, this is a petition.

340
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,480
I am the president of the Farmers'
Union. They are.. - I know them.

341
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,400
Sir, my daughter did not commit
suicide. She was murdered.

342
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,280
The petition says it all.

343
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,800
We need justice, sir.
- I will do the needful.

344
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,320
We have just started our
investigation.

345
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,360
I will be coming to take your
statements.

346
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,360
Then you can tell me everything.

347
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,080
Okay, sir. Shall we leave?
- Okay.

348
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,960
Hey! How could you kill my
daughter? - Dad!

349
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,520
Thomachan! - I will kill you!
- Hey!

350
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,440
Leave him..
- I will kill you!

351
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,400
Hey! - You!
- Dad!

352
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,560
I will kill you.. - Come.
- Stop.. - Scoundrel!

353
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,800
The statements and evidence
I have got till now force me

354
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,880
to conclude that Omana's
death was suicide.

355
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,960
Except for Sreedharan's
statement.

356
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,280
But we can't go to a conclusion
with that alone.

357
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,680
Because there was a bit
of exaggeration.

358
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,640
He might change his statement
any moment.

359
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,440
Even my conclusion is the same.

360
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,560
Especially since she'd attempted
suicide before.

361
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,040
And the post-mortem report
also supports the claim.

362
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,000
That is right.

363
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,840
But I am not able to completely
believe these evidence

364
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,320
and statements before me.

365
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,240
But it is of no use.

366
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,240
I will need at least a clue

367
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,400
to proceed with this as a murder
investigation.

368
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,640
The only people left to be
interrogated are Thomachan

369
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,920
Annie and some country folk.

370
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,760
I hope I get something positive
from them. - Don't hope so, sir.

371
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,800
We left out a person, sir.
Mr. Vasu, the driver.

372
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,000
He would be of no use to us.

373
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,960
I have got some doubts, sir.
- What is it? Tell me.

374
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,880
According to the doctor's
statement

375
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,680
the death had occurred 15 hours
before they found her. - Go on.

376
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,640
The post-mortem was done
at 11 a.m.

377
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,680
So, the death would have occurred

378
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,320
on the previous night
around 8 p.m.

379
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,760
That night, it was raining heavily
till 9:30 p.m.

380
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,960
I was on duty at that time.

381
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,680
It was almost 9:30 p.m.
when the rain had stopped

382
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,080
and that was when I went out
to have dinner.

383
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,840
If Omana had committed suicide
at 8 p.m.

384
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,240
the dead body and her clothes
must have been

385
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,080
damp with rainwater and mud.

386
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,720
Moreover, the blood would have
been washed down in the rain water.

387
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,040
My opinion is that Omana's death
was not suicide.

388
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,280
What if the doctor was at fault?

389
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,880
There could be a difference
of one or two hours.

390
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,640
Anyway, we will wait
for the forensic report.

391
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,120
Isn't it, sir? - Yes.
I agree with you.

392
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,760
I shall take a leave.
It is already late. - Okay.

393
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,240
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

394
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,400
You have got a good point.

395
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,120
When Alex mentioned about
the doctor

396
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,400
I just agreed with him
for no reason.

397
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,320
I felt like Alex wants this death
to be proved as suicide.

398
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,280
Don't you think so?
- I am not sure, sir.

399
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,360
How is Thomachan related to you?
- He is my uncle, sir.

400
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,800
But that was not the reason behind
my doubts.

401
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,880
I understand.

402
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,560
We need to search for Vasu
tomorrow.

403
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,320
He may be very useful to us.
- Yes, sir.

404
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,800
Sir, I have kept the file
in your room.

405
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,440
Shall I leave?
- Sure, Chacko. Okay.

406
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,920
Whatever might be the evidence

407
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,080
he didn't believe that it's a
suicide from the start.

408
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,560
His doubts are stronger now.
- Damn!

409
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,360
That doctor betrayed us.

410
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,840
What is the use of complaining
now?

411
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,640
By the way, didn't you bribe
that doctor? - Of course.

412
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,840
He is a close friend of Johny.

413
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,680
But our friendship didn't reflect
on the bribe.

414
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,280
Still that bastard cheated me!

415
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,400
By the way, how is Mr. Varma?
Will he fall into our trap?

416
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,440
Keep waiting!
Have you gone crazy?

417
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,680
SP Prabhakara Varma is an officer

418
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,960
who will never compromise
with his duties

419
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,240
no matter who approaches him.

420
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,840
He does not even care about
being dismissed.

421
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,600
Mr. Narayanan, let me make
it clear to you.

422
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,520
Mr. Varma will try his level best
to prove this case.

423
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,920
You will be trapped for sure.

424
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,040
If you are destined to spend
your life in prison

425
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,560
then it is bound to happen.

426
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,880
Hey, why are you trying
to scare me?

427
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,800
I am not scaring anyone.
I am just stating the facts.

428
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,160
Such a nuisance! Do you have
any solution for this?

429
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,840
Mr. Varma should not investigate
this case.

430
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,320
We have to keep him away
from further investigation.

431
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,360
How is that possible?

432
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,640
You need to influence higher
officials and get it done!

433
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,080
There is no use in carrying the
cash in a money purse or a handbag.

434
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,840
Tell Ouseppachan
to carry it in a sack.

435
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,160
Well, how will I tell him?

436
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,160
Come with me.
- I won't come.

437
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,960
I made a suggestion based
on our acquaintance.

438
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,960
I am leaving.

439
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,120
One more thing.

440
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,480
While meeting the hot shots

441
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,960
please don't neglect me.

442
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,520
I am not from a wealthy family.

443
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,080
I have children who're in schools
and colleges.

444
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,720
Who knows if the IG and the
Minister are in Trivandrum?

445
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,840
Don't you have a phone?

446
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,000
Call them.
I am leaving.

447
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,680
Annie!

448
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,840
Dear!

449
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,440
Annie!
- What is it, Dad?

450
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,680
Please read this, dear.

451
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,560
Here.

452
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,040
'A new twist in the Omana case.'

453
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,640
'As many mysteries are
associated with the case'

454
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,160
'DySP Prabhakara Varma'

455
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,720
'who was heading the investigation'

456
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,600
'has been replaced by
the new DySP, Mr. Devadas.'

457
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,920
Jesus!
This is not fair.

458
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,520
What will we do now, dear?

459
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,200
We shall meet Mr. Chacko.

460
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,640
Yes. You are right.

461
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,320
I got the order yesterday.

462
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,600
Transfer to the Traffic Department.

463
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,200
Mr. Varma got transferred
to the Rural Department.

464
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,760
Why did they do so
without prior notice?

465
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,800
We might not have a reason.

466
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,360
Who is the new officer?

467
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,000
I heard that it was DySP,
Mr. Devadas.

468
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,280
What is his nature?

469
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,120
They will be benefitted.
- Who?

470
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,520
The ones who fear that the truth
in this case will be exposed.

471
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,640
Can no one oppose this?

472
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,880
The ones who are responsible
for opposing this

473
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,160
have signed this order.

474
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,520
What can we do?

475
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,840
What is the solution to this now?

476
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,360
There is only one
solution for this.

477
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,840
We need to obtain maximum
public support for this case.

478
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,080
Through newspapers and other media

479
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,360
this case must be made sensational.

480
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,160
How can we do this
in such short notice?

481
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,160
Okay.
We can do it slowly.

482
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,440
Let the new officer
start the investigation.

483
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,960
Dad.

484
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
The police are coming.

485
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,080
Mr. John Thomas?
- It is me, sir.

486
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,480
Who is Ms. Annie?
- I am Annie.

487
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,800
Okay.

488
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,000
Why do you feel that your daughter
didn't commit suicide, Mr. Thomas?

489
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,600
My daughter will never
commit suicide, sir.

490
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
So do you believe
that she was murdered?

491
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,200
Yes.

492
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,440
Who do you suspect, Mr. Thomas?

493
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,960
Is it Mr. Sunny,
Or Mr. Ouseppachan

494
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
or both of them?

495
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,160
I don't know, sir.

496
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,720
Was there any issue based on dowry?

497
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,040
Did you deny the dowry you promised

498
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,680
did Sunny create
a scene for that

499
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,040
and assault Omana for that?

500
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,760
That is my question.

501
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,280
No, sir.

502
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,200
Does Mr. Ouseppachan have any
personal vendetta against you?

503
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,920
Yes.

504
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,880
Come.

505
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,240
What is the reason?

506
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,240
I helped Mr. Ouseppachan
when he needed help.

507
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,200
When I needed help in return,
I went to him.

508
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,200
He did not like that.

509
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,920
That does not mean that
he has a personal vendetta.

510
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,640
But the relationship between
us became sour from that point.

511
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,800
He did not let me visit
my daughter after that.

512
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,440
We did not even receive
a letter from her.

513
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,440
When did this happen?

514
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,240
It has been a few months.

515
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,400
Is it?

516
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,480
If he did have a grudge against you

517
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,920
he could have sent Omana back.

518
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,160
Else he could have settled
scores with you directly.

519
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,320
But what is the use
in killing Omana?

520
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,880
Why are you adamant to close
this as a suicide case?

521
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,840
When I question Mr. Thomas,
he should answer.

522
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,240
You may talk when I talk to you.

523
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,440
Got it?

524
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,480
Didn't Omana try to commit
suicide before?

525
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,040
Or did someone try to poison her?

526
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,760
Omana can't have children,
isn't it?

527
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,560
Yes.

528
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,160
Was she sad about that?

529
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,920
Of course, sir.

530
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,960
Did she try anything
because of that..

531
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,400
I don't know.

532
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,120
But DySP Mr. Varma..
- I am not DySP Mr. Varma.

533
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,640
I am the one who
handles this case now.

534
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,480
Do you have anything else to say?

535
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,200
No.

536
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,720
Come.

537
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,960
What has happened has happened.

538
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,160
Why do you want to bother everyone

539
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,280
for a murder that
did not happen, Mr. Thomas?

540
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,520
Oh, no..

541
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,440
Hey. How dare you give
a false statement!

542
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,760
Oh, sir.
I told the truth, sir. - Nonsense.

543
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,720
Oh, don't hit me, sir.
- Damn.

544
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,840
Oh, don't me beat me again, sir.

545
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,000
I will make you spit out the truth.
- Oh.. God. Oh, sir.

546
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,160
Oh!

547
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,840
Move.

548
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,400
Walk!
- Oh, no.

549
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,880
Stand straight.

550
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,920
When your neighbour,
Ouseppachan's daughter-in-law died

551
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,360
did you hear anything
fall in that house?

552
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,160
Yes.
- Did you? - No.

553
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,960
Why didn't you hear it?

554
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,600
We weren't there at that time.

555
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,240
Where were you?

556
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,400
I had gone with my wife
to the Guruvayur temple.

557
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,480
Okay.

558
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,560
What is your opinion about Sunny,
Sreedharan?

559
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,640
He is a good man.

560
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,440
What about when he is drinking?

561
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,720
While drinking..
- Yes?

562
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,600
I have not seen him getting drunk.

563
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,400
What about Mr. Ouseppachan?

564
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,080
He is a fraud, sir.
He is a bad man.

565
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,840
Alex

566
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,920
take him in for another round.

567
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,080
Oh!
No, sir.

568
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,680
I will tell the truth.
Alex is a good man.

569
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,600
I mean,
Mr. Ouseppachan is a good man.

570
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,320
He is big-hearted, kind

571
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
and someone who is loved
by everyone.

572
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,640
Why didn't you say
this to Mr. Varma? - Well, I..

573
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,040
Because.. - You won't tell him.
Aren't you Ouseppachan's tenant?

574
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,760
Didn't you give a false
statement fearing an eviction?

575
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,640
Am I right?
- Yes.

576
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,160
He is crooked, Alex.

577
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,160
Get his statement immediately.

578
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,720
Oh, keep it there.

579
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,640
No. I am on duty.

580
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,600
It is a Remy Martin, sir.

581
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,680
I have been wearing the uniform
for many years, Mr. Ouseppachan.

582
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,800
All the cases I have handled

583
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,360
have not crossed
the limits I have set.

584
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,520
Narayanan told me.

585
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,200
As I am not used
to being ungrateful

586
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,760
I, DySP Devadas, am

587
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,520
considered me to be the loyal
officer in the department.

588
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,320
Arrest the culprits
behind Omana's murder!

589
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,240
Arrest the culprits
behind Omana's murder!

590
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,040
We want the investigation
to be transparent!

591
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,920
We want the investigation
to be transparent!

592
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,240
Sunny should be arrested!

593
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,520
Sunny should be arrested!

594
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,800
Police should do their duty!

595
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,240
Police should do their duty!

596
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,520
Ouseppachan's rowdyism
should be put to an end!

597
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,480
Ouseppachan should
behave himself!

598
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,280
Arrest the guilty
behind Omana's murder!

599
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,000
Arrest the guilty
behind Omana's murder!

600
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,280
Ouseppachan, you murderer..

601
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,320
We'll make you pay
for your sins..

602
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,040
Corrupt officer Devadas!

603
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,720
Corrupt officer Devadas!

604
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,280
We will make you
pay for your acts!

605
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,800
We will make you
pay for your acts!

606
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,840
Long live the revolution!
- Long live the revolution!

607
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,600
We want the investigation
to be transparent.

608
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,320
We want the investigation
to be transparent.

609
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,160
Sunny should be arrested..
- Hey!

610
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,160
Ask them to stay there.
- Stop there!

611
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,960
Stop! Don't come any closer.
- Long live the revolution!

612
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,440
Long live the revolution!

613
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,160
Long live the revolution!
- Long live the revolution!

614
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,600
Arrest the culprits
behind Omana's murder!

615
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,680
Arrest the culprits
behind Omana's murder!

616
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,040
Arrest the culprits..
- Police should do their duty!

617
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,400
Police should do their duty!

618
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,560
Police.. - Arrest the culprits
behind Omana's murder!

619
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,720
Arrest the culprits
behind Omana's murder!

620
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,120
Long live the revolution!

621
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,440
Alex, ask the leader to come here.

622
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,040
Yes, sir!
- Police should do their duty!

623
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,640
Police should do their duty!
- Stop! I said, stop!

624
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
Three of you, come with me.

625
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,800
Stand over there.

626
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,880
You stand here.

627
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,880
What's your problem?

628
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,960
Don't you know it?
- Hey, old hag!

629
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,840
There is no use in
shouting over here.

630
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,280
Let me tell you something.

631
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,280
I'll do my best if you're
ready to co-operate.

632
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,640
Else I'll make you regret.

633
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,680
We'll protest against you!

634
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,760
Shut up!
- Devadas should do his duty!

635
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,480
I know how to deal
with you people.

636
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,680
Devadas should do his duty!

637
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,520
Devadas should do his duty..

638
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,680
Devadas should do his duty..

639
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,520
Come in, let's start.

640
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,960
Stop!

641
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,400
'Guest House, Kumarapuram.'
- It should be fair..

642
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,320
Thomachan is here.
- Oh. - Oh.

643
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,920
Have you been waiting for long?
- No, we just reached here.

644
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,400
The minister is inside.
- Who among you is Thomas?

645
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,840
It's me. - The minister wants
to see you. - Come, dear.

646
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,520
I am about
to read the charge sheet.

647
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,320
Please sit.
- No, it's all right.

648
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,360
'The complaint was filed by
Mr. Johny who lives near'

649
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,120
'the Keezhmad-Kanjikuzhy road.'

650
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,760
'Omana, wife
of Johny's Brother-in-law'

651
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,080
'Mr. Sunny of Kilivathil family'

652
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,520
'committed suicide'

653
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,200
'by jumping off the terrace
of the two-storeyed house'

654
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,560
'owned by Mr. Ouseppachan,
Johny's father-in-law'

655
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,160
'as she felt her life was hopeless'

656
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,000
'on June 29, 1987, Tuesday,
at 8 p.m.' - Oh, God!

657
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,360
I understand the grief that your
daughter's untimely death

658
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,480
has brought upon you.

659
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,920
But I'm helpless
as the police investigation

660
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,560
proved that it was suicide, sir.

661
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,080
Sir, I've something to tell you.

662
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,280
Please.

663
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,120
We're not happy with the way
the police investigated this case.

664
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,280
Why? - Initially, Mr. Varma was
in charge of the investigation.

665
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,280
But he was removed from
the position suddenly.

666
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,000
No.. You are wrong.
What you said is not true.

667
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,240
Varma was already investigating
another case when he was

668
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,800
asked to investigate this one.

669
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,240
Another officer
was assigned to the case as

670
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,800
Varma had to resume the
investigation of the other case.

671
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,960
How will we get justice
if you give silly excuses?

672
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,240
Why are you overreacting
when the victim's family is not?

673
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,680
Please go outside.

674
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,720
Understand that it's not practical

675
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,720
to choose the investigating
officer of every single case

676
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,640
according to the public's choice.

677
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,960
Moreover, the investigation
of this case is done and dusted.

678
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,360
The cops beat us up when we marched

679
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,640
to Ouseppachan's house
to state that the case should

680
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,840
be investigated again.

681
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,840
The cops were
just doing their duty.

682
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,840
They are
supposed to enforce the law.

683
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,400
You shouldn't have marched

684
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,800
to Ouseppachan's house, Thomachan.

685
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,520
If you had
anything to say to him

686
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,240
you should have
done that in person.

687
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,160
Is it wrong
to protest for our rights, sir?

688
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,640
You shouldn't protest for your
rights if it'd get you beaten up.

689
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,400
Do one thing.

690
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,520
Don't bother anymore
about the investigation officer.

691
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,280
If there were any flaws

692
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,080
in the investigation, give me

693
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,520
a written complaint and I'll
take necessary action.

694
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,800
Sir.. - I'm in a hurry.
See you, Thomachan.

695
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,440
Send a petition to the home
minister the Supreme Court

696
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,040
and the additional secretary.
Mention all the

697
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,280
details that I just said.

698
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,560
If you have
any doubts, you may

699
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,240
come here.
I'll be here as the court

700
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,040
is closed today.

701
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,360
Okay.
- Okay, sir. - Okay.

702
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,080
The Chief Justice.
- Supreme Court of India.

703
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,880
Tilak Mag, New Delhi.

704
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,040
To whom should the next
one be addressed? - Next..

705
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,600
Additional private secretary.

706
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,680
Grievances.
Write that in brackets.

707
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,040
Okay.
- Prime Minister's Secretariat.

708
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,720
Third block, New Delhi.

709
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,920
To the Union Minister
of Home Affairs.

710
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,560
Third block, New Delhi.

711
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,640
Pin them together.
- Okay.

712
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,680
The Supreme Court of India

713
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,680
this day order

714
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,960
the crime petition number

715
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,160
crime 25/86 of Kumarapuram
police station, Kerala state

716
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,120
to be investigated by the

717
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,240
deputy superintendent of police

718
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,760
Central Bureau of Investigations,
Kerala circle.

719
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,040
Dad, a rickshaw is coming our way.

720
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,080
Get in, dear.

721
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,920
Take us to the CBI office.

722
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,120
What is it?

723
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,400
Have a seat.

724
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,960
You've been told to go inside.

725
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:39,920
Sit down.

726
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,560
Are you Mr. Thomas,
who filed this petition?

727
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,560
Yes, sir.

728
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,440
As per the order of the
Supreme Court, the CBI

729
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,120
will be investigating this case.

730
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,760
We wanted to
ask you some things

731
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,080
before the
investigation gets underway.

732
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,880
That's why you
were asked to come.

733
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,240
Sethu, please come here.

734
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,760
It is not often that the CBI

735
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,320
investigates a case which

736
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,000
the state
police had referred.

737
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,760
It is yet to prove whether this is

738
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,360
a case of murder.

739
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,960
It is not possible
to investigate this case

740
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,720
based on the details mentioned

741
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,600
in this petition
and some hypothesis.

742
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,520
So, we expect
your full cooperation.

743
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,600
Mr. Sethu, you are deputed for the
enquiry of the Omana murder case.

744
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,560
Thank you, sir.

745
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,720
He is Mr. Sethurama Iyer,
DySP of CBI.

746
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,200
He'll be investigating this case.

747
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,520
He is Thomas and
she is Annie, his daughter.

748
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,600
Complainants.

749
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,240
Sethu has some questions for you.

750
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,080
Sethu, please take them.
- Yes, sir. - Come.

751
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,360
Sir, please help me.
- You are to only tell the truth.

752
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,240
I will, sir.
- Okay.

753
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:15,920
Come.

754
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,680
Sit down.

755
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,360
Was Omana's marriage
a love marriage?

756
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,640
No, it was an arranged marriage.
- I see.

757
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,920
You and Ouseppachan are

758
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,120
on different levels
when it comes to money.

759
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,920
I wasn't suggesting
that the marriage shouldn't

760
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,120
have happened because of that.
But I couldn't help asking.

761
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,200
Were there any special interests
behind this marriage?

762
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,680
No. Ouseppachan
wasn't this rich at that

763
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,400
point in time.

764
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,080
Ouseppachan has told me that my
daughter is the reason for all the

765
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,800
prosperity his family enjoys now.

766
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,160
I see.

767
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,840
Ouseppachan and you aren't
on good terms now, are you?

768
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,040
No.

769
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,560
How long has it been since
the marriage? - Five years.

770
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,240
Can you brief me on all the key
incidents that happened

771
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,960
during the last five years?
- Yes, sir.

772
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,400
Come on, tell me.

773
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,520
Come here.
Come on!

774
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:20,960
Go.

775
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,160
This is my eldest daughter, Omana.

776
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,200
Dear, hand him the cup.

777
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,000
You may go inside.

778
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,120
Not so fast!

779
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,480
How is he?
- Stop teasing me!

780
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,040
Did you like him?

781
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,040
You did like him!

782
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,320
My son liked her.

783
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,360
If we get to know
Omana's decision

784
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,000
let's discuss the rest.

785
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,680
My daughter will
agree to my decision.

786
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,120
Then again, to get her married
off so soon..

787
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,640
There is something
else that we should..

788
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,800
Things are pretty much
straight forward, Thomachan.

789
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,960
My son had to like her.

790
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
He liked her
and I told you about it.

791
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,240
All I want to know now
is your decision.

792
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,120
If you are okay with it,
let's choose a date after Easter.

793
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,640
As you wish.

794
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,560
There is something else that we
should.. - I get you.

795
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,040
Let's not discuss about dowry.

796
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,560
She is your daughter and you can
give her what you wish to.

797
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,840
It doesn't
matter what you give her.

798
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,840
God bless you!

799
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,120
The complainant ended up
behind bars!

800
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,680
I don't care about those people!

801
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,760
Thomachan, the auspicious
time will be over by 4:30 p.m.

802
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,080
We've to reach home before that.

803
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,640
Daughter.
Come, it's time.

804
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,040
Come.

805
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,360
Come

806
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,800
I am leaving.

807
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,440
Their married life

808
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,680
was jovial.

809
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,600
They used to visit us
once in a while.

810
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,040
We used to visit them too.

811
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,680
Ouseppachan started a new business
with Johny's help.

812
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,280
Who is Johny?

813
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,720
Sunny's brother-in-law.

814
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,080
What kind of business? - He
started with small contract works.

815
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,720
Sunny got business
as the business grew.

816
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,960
And their visits became rare.

817
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,800
But that never affected
our relationship.

818
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,680
Okay.

819
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,680
Hello.
Speaking.

820
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,400
Kamalam, tell me what it is.

821
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,440
Give it to him.

822
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,920
One minute.
It's from home.

823
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,200
Raja, father here.

824
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,160
Be a good boy and got to school.

825
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,600
No, you must go to school.

826
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,160
Okay?

827
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,720
When I come home in the evening

828
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,000
I'll bring you Eclairs, chocolates
and everything.

829
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,480
Okay?

830
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,600
Promise.

831
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,040
Okay.

832
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,400
Now tell me.

833
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,280
One day, Ouseppachan came home
to meet father.

834
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,640
As you know, along with Johny
I have started a small business.

835
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:53,280
I have given all my assets
to the government for it.

836
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,880
That is why I am doing this.

837
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,280
I never thought the loan
would be passed so soon.

838
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,720
That's when
this cropped up.

839
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,560
They are demanding
for collateral security.

840
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,160
I am asking you since
I have no other choice.

841
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,600
How can I let go of the loan

842
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,280
because I can't give
a collateral security?

843
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,360
I won't be able to complete
the bridge construction contract

844
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,840
if I don't get the loan.

845
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,880
So please help me.

846
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,880
I am happy to help you.

847
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,120
Let me discuss it with Annie.
- Okay.

848
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,520
What are you asking me?

849
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,800
Will I ever say no?

850
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,120
Then give me the documents.

851
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,960
Here.
May God bless you.

852
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Everything will be fine.

853
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,560
Ask me and I will get it back
within a month's time.

854
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,840
You'll have to come
to the bank too.

855
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,000
I will inform you.

856
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,760
You have to sign as a guarantor.
- I'll come.

857
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,200
And Ouseppachan left
with the documents.

858
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,600
What happened after that?

859
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,360
His business flourished very fast.

860
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,240
He got a car, a big house,
servants

861
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,960
and started a few more businesses.

862
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,400
I have heard that men new money
can be arrogant.

863
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,240
But I experienced it.

864
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,720
He was ashamed to keep
a relationship with me.

865
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,960
But I bore with it.

866
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,200
For my elder daughter.

867
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,040
And?
- I had a dire need for money.

868
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,520
Since I had no money

869
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,400
I planned to sell my plot.

870
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,320
I went to meet Ouseppachan

871
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,960
to get my documents back.

872
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,800
Why do you need money?

873
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,240
Haven't I mentioned to you

874
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,360
about my late sister once?

875
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,840
She has two sons.

876
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,320
The elder one got
into police somehow.

877
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,680
The younger one is unemployed.

878
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,800
He's got a job offer in Dubai.

879
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,920
He needs money for Visa.

880
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,760
I promised him that I
would arrange some.

881
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,440
Why did you make such promises,
Thomachan?

882
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,160
Please don't talk like that.

883
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,520
All the land I have
is ancestral property.

884
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,960
Even I am not legally bound to

885
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,280
but I want to
give them a share of it.

886
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,760
I have mentioned this to them too.

887
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,120
What am I supposed to do?

888
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,320
As you know I have no
other means for money.

889
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,680
So if you give me back
the documents

890
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,320
I will sell some plot
to get some money for him.

891
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,600
How can I get it if you
ask all of a sudden?

892
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,440
Bank won't give it
unless you close the loan.

893
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:36,840
Won't they?

894
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,760
Then at least lend me Rs. 15,000.

895
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,800
Well..
What are you saying?

896
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,160
I am trying hard
to make some money.

897
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,080
Only God knows my hardship.

898
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:53,080
You told me that
you would get it back

899
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,560
within a month when I need it.

900
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,400
Don't lie, Thomachan.

901
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,120
I never said that.

902
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,680
Hello, Mr. Ousep here.

903
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,320
Sir! This is Ouseppachan.

904
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,960
What is there to ask?

905
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,080
How can I say not to you?

906
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,720
No.
There is nothing like that.

907
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,640
I will get you as much as you want.

908
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,400
There's no need for that.

909
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,800
I will bring it myself.

910
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:22,920
Okay, sir.

911
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,760
Did you get your documents back?

912
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:30,920
Yes.

913
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,080
After a month.

914
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,240
After that,
we were distant.

915
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,400
Did you meet after that?

916
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,560
No matter what,
how can I not see my child?

917
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,880
One day, I went to meet her.

918
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,160
Please don't be so cruel.

919
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,400
Please let me see my child.
- Not possible.

920
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,680
Don't you have a daughter too?

921
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,040
Please let me see her.

922
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,360
I told you it is not possible.

923
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,680
Dear!

924
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,640
Father.
- Dear!

925
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,960
What are you doing?
- Vasu. - Yes.

926
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,160
Please let me see her.
- No.

927
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,840
Leave me.
- Throw him out.

928
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,480
Father!
- Leave me.

929
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,760
Leave.
- Come on. - Leave me.

930
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,800
Sunny!
- Father!

931
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,400
Leave me.
- Let me see my father.

932
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,160
Come here.
- Father. - Shut up.

933
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,720
Come on.
- Dear!

934
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,760
Dear!
- Omana. - Father.

935
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,400
Let me see him.

936
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,640
Leave me!

937
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,080
You!

938
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,520
Shut up!
- What do you want?

939
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,880
I will kill you.
- I want to see my father.

940
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,160
You!

941
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,440
You!
- Take her inside.

942
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,520
I said leave me.

943
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:34,760
Get in!

944
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,960
Did you go there after that?

945
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,760
He never let us see her
even if we did.

946
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,160
I send her letters.

947
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,520
I got few replies.

948
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,760
Later it ceased.
- He might have threatened her.

949
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,400
Where are the letters now?

950
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,680
They might be at home.

951
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,360
So was that your last
encounter with Omana?

952
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:55,840
No.

953
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,240
Dig..
- Father, sister is hospitalised.

954
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,600
What happened?
- She consumed poison. - What?

955
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,640
Daughter!

956
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,800
Sister.
- Omana.

957
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:19,880
Dear.

958
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,800
Why did you do this?

959
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,560
Tell me, dear.

960
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,120
Dear.

961
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,960
Tell me.

962
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,120
Daughter!
- Please.

963
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,680
Dear.
- Please wait outside.

964
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,600
Father. - Dear.
- Come on, Father.

965
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,880
When I saw her next time,
she was lying still.

966
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,600
How many days after the fight
you had with Ouseppachan

967
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,680
about the documents
did she poison herself?

968
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,320
A few days, I think.
I don't remember the exact date.

969
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,080
Only cowards try to commit suicide.

970
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,440
You daughter already tried it once.

971
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,640
Still, you think that her
death is not suicide.

972
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,680
Why do you think so?

973
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,320
My nephew, Chacko,
is in the police.

974
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,520
He was also a part
of the case investigation.

975
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:34,080
He felt suspicious about the
evidence and testimonies.

976
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,480
So he reported it to Mr. Varma
who was investigating the case.

977
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,600
He felt the same too.

978
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,040
That is when he was removed
from the case.

979
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,920
Tell Chacko to meet me
tomorrow

980
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,960
at this hotel at 7 p.m.

981
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,800
Tell him to ask the receptionist.

982
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,080
Do you have anything
further to ask?

983
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,040
No, you may leave.

984
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,600
Okay, sir.

985
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:01,960
How did the session go?

986
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,120
As I expected

987
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,600
I can ignore 99 percentage of it.

988
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,800
So it is not going to be hard,
is it?

989
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,520
Yes.

990
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,960
Let's close this file
after an investigation

991
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,440
just for formality,
shall we?

992
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,680
We'll support the findings
of the state police.

993
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,040
Wait.

994
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,960
I am meeting
constable Chacko tomorrow.

995
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,920
I will give you my final
opinion after that.

996
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,600
Mr. Sethuraman.
- Room number 302.

997
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,600
Thank you.

998
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,360
Aren't you Chacko?

999
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,800
Yes, sir.
- Come in.

1000
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,320
I asked you to come here
since the matter is personal.

1001
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:58,960
Sit down.

1002
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,400
Don't worry.
Have a seat.

1003
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,920
In such a case,
I am aware of the complications

1004
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,720
that could be produced by the
involvement of a police officer.

1005
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,680
I am not going to record anything.

1006
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,600
You don't have to sign
on any statements either.

1007
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,200
I came to know that you had
certain doubts about this case

1008
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,560
from Thomas and Annie.

1009
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:22,160
What made you think that
this is a case of murder?

1010
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,560
The doctor had testified that the
death had happened 15 hours ago.

1011
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,920
The postmortem had taken
place at 11 a.m. the next day.

1012
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,400
So, she would've
died at around 8 p.m. on that day.

1013
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,120
But there was a heavy rain till
9:30 p.m. on the day she died.

1014
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,880
I was on duty on that day.

1015
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,240
Both Balakrishnan Nair and I

1016
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,760
went for dinner once the
rain stopped at 9:30 p.m.

1017
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,760
If Omana had committed
suicide at 8 p.m.

1018
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:52,000
her body would have
been covered with dirt.

1019
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,520
Also, her blood would have
mixed in the rainwater.

1020
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,600
These are the doubts I had.

1021
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,160
The doctor's statement
was taken by the SI.

1022
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,600
There was a contrast between

1023
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,760
his statement and the
postmortem report.

1024
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,280
The 15 hours which was
there in his statement

1025
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,400
was reduced to 13 hours
in the certificate.

1026
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,880
Why didn't you question
the doctor about this?

1027
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,160
It wasn't required.
- Correct.

1028
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,560
They would've dealt with them.

1029
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,000
What if that was a genuine mistake?

1030
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,360
That can be said
for argument's sake.

1031
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,160
But I really don't think so.

1032
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:31,280
I think his first statement
happened to be a truth by accident.

1033
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,960
But his postmortem report

1034
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,600
is in favour of suicide.

1035
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,240
He must have been forced into it.

1036
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,320
Thank you very much, Mr. Chacko.
We shall meet again.

1037
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,320
Thank you, sir.

1038
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,000
Reception.
I'll be vacating the room soon.

1039
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,480
Please send me the bill.

1040
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,800
Chacko.

1041
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,320
Do Chacko's points seem valid?

1042
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,160
Especially, when there
is a contrast between

1043
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,960
the doctor's statement and
his postmortem report?

1044
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,400
Let them accept the postmortem
report in legal terms.

1045
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,480
But this contrast between

1046
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,120
his statement and
the postmortem report

1047
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,640
is a loophole for us to work.

1048
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,640
So you are in the game.

1049
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,280
Have you decided to
proceed with it? - Yes, sir.

1050
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,040
Especially after
yesterday's incident.

1051
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,520
That has accelerated
my doubts in this case.

1052
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,720
A policeman might
have many enemies. - Of course.

1053
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,040
But considering the
present situation

1054
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,520
I don't think that is the case.

1055
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,960
Well, then you can proceed.
- Yes, sir.

1056
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,000
Who do you want to assist you?

1057
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,000
I would prefer Circle Inspector,
Harry

1058
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,960
and Sub-Inspector, Vikram.
- Okay.

1059
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,120
Send Harry and Vikram.

1060
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,840
The DIG there is an
old friend of mine.

1061
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,880
You should meet him first.
He will do the needful. - Sir.

1062
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,680
Vikram and Harry?
- Yes, sir.

1063
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,400
Sethu wants you to
assist him in this case.

1064
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,000
What do you have to say?
- With pleasure, sir.

1065
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,120
Sethu, you can carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

1066
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:53,720
Now, this is your property. It has
all the details about this case.

1067
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,320
I am aware that the
local police is not happy

1068
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,880
in handing over
this case to CBI.

1069
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,800
But as responsible officers

1070
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:06,400
both my team and I wish
to do this efficiently.

1071
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:10,640
I need your full cooperation.
- Of course, I will do my best.

1072
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,040
Thank you, sir.

1073
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,200
Meet Mr. Devadas.

1074
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,760
This is DySP Sethurama Iyer
from CBI.

1075
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,480
Mr. Swamy?
- Yes.

1076
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,800
How do you do?
- Fine, thank you.

1077
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,360
'Malaria prevention awareness
week. - Beloved friends.'

1078
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,880
'Today at 3 p.m.,
at the Panchayat Community Hall.'

1079
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,800
'The honourable Health Minister
will inaugurate'

1080
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,880
'the Cure Malaria Week'

1081
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,520
'in association with
Kumarapuram Panchayat'

1082
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,800
'and the Kerala Health Department'

1083
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:43,080
'Do come forward to check your
blood to cure malaria.'

1084
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,960
'The health service officers'

1085
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,120
'would be examining your blood'

1086
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,480
'for one week from tomorrow.'

1087
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,000
'Kindly cooperate with us'

1088
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,360
'and come forward to
cure this disease.'

1089
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:22,720
Where are our rooms?

1090
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,240
One is this one and
the other is upstairs.

1091
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:27,400
Vikram. - Give this to me.
Take this upstairs.

1092
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,800
Dad is really scared
after knowing that

1093
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,000
the CBI is camping
in that guest house.

1094
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,440
There is nothing to be scared.

1095
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,640
You should never deviate
from your statement.

1096
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,160
They won't be able to find
anything as long as you do that

1097
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:56,160
Like a man can him can
investigate a murder case.

1098
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,520
Did you meet him?
- Yes, I did.

1099
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,920
I got introduced to him
at the DIG's office.

1100
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,840
Sunny is there inside.
Give it to him.

1101
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,360
How did it go?
- It was okay.

1102
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,120
Shall I go?
- Okay.

1103
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,680
I am leaving.
Come here.

1104
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,640
Don't forget to give
me the balance.

1105
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:36,600
I had paid you the other day.
- There is no fixed rate for this.

1106
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,480
Isn't there an end to this?
I cannot talk to Ouseppachan again.

1107
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:42,280
I don't know. I need the
cash by tomorrow afternoon.

1108
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,120
I am capable of changing
a murder to suicide and vice versa.

1109
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,480
I will call you tomorrow
afternoon. - Don't call me.

1110
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,880
I will call you.
Let's go.

1111
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,480
What is the matter?
- Nothing.

1112
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,560
I know
what he would have told him.

1113
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,880
He is planning to buy some
land and a building in the city.

1114
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:10,800
He would be in need of some
money to pay for it.

1115
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,280
Even I am leaving.

1116
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:19,200
My car is in the workshop.

1117
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:20,520
He had even called me today.

1118
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,240
Please give me some time.
I will do the needful.

1119
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,640
You cannot say so.

1120
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,800
I will send my son to
your office tomorrow.

1121
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,760
Please come and
drop me to my home.

1122
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,440
Go ahead.
- Nuisance.

1123
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,680
The people who wanted to buy
our estate didn't turn up.

1124
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,760
You should go along with him
and enquire about it tomorrow.

1125
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,360
It's okay if they want it
for a lesser amount.

1126
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,680
Why do you want
to make a loss?

1127
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,560
Let them approach us.
- Nobody asked your opinion.

1128
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,040
It's all because of you.

1129
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,800
Johny, go and do the needful.
- Okay.

1130
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,080
Chapatti
and vegetable curry was amazing.

1131
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,720
Make this every day.
Right, Vikram?

1132
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:17,960
Yes..

1133
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,440
Hey.
- Yes?

1134
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,720
He will ask you to make this daily.
- Yes.

1135
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,360
But we need some real food.

1136
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,240
Real food?

1137
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,040
Hey, we need
a little fish and meat!

1138
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:27,960
Okay.
- Vikram.

1139
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:34,920
Vikram.
- Yes, sir?

1140
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,480
We should start
our investigation tomorrow.

1141
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,360
I'll explain the modus operandi.

1142
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:40,720
So..

1143
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,960
We should investigate
this case in three stages.

1144
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,000
We should first investigate

1145
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,920
if there were any corruption

1146
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,680
in the investigation
of the crime 25/86.

1147
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,320
Only then will there be any reason
in CBI investigating this case.

1148
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,480
The second stage
of the investigation

1149
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:03,680
is to find whether Omana's death
was murder or suicide.

1150
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,640
Our job will be over
soon if it's suicide.

1151
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,760
On the other hand,
if it's a murder

1152
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,200
Our actual headache
will start then.

1153
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,240
That's where our investigation's
third stage will begin.

1154
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,280
We can't expect anything from
the police report we got.

1155
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,840
The police who referred this case
are capable of twisting any case.

1156
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,840
My headache already started.
- That's because you're sober.

1157
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,320
Listen carefully.

1158
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,480
Yes, sir.
- Vikram.

1159
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,280
You should take a stroll around
this village tomorrow.

1160
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,960
You should investigate everything
about Ouseppachan's business.

1161
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,960
Find out who are his close friends

1162
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,720
in which bank he's got accounts

1163
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,560
and other details if you can.
- Yes, sir.

1164
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:43,800
I'll go and meet

1165
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,960
DYSP Mr. Varma who investigated
this case first.

1166
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,880
You should go
to the telephone exchange, Harry.

1167
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,240
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1168
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,360
I'm Sethuraman from CBI.
- Please, take a seat.

1169
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,280
Thank you, sir.
- I heard that you've reached.

1170
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,680
I thought I'll meet you before
I start the investigation.

1171
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,000
Also, I had some doubts.

1172
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,160
Constable Chacko told
there were some contradictions

1173
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,680
in the testimony of the doctor
who did the postmortem.

1174
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,760
Did you question that doctor again?

1175
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:19,920
They removed me from
the case before that.

1176
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:23,880
Do you suspect anyone?

1177
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,200
Anyone can be a suspect
if you want.

1178
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,640
There were loopholes
in everyone's testimonies.

1179
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,120
I didn't even complete
my first round investigation.

1180
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:36,560
They probably had a problem
with my investigation before that.

1181
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,680
An order out of nowhere.

1182
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,480
I got a transfer to the rural.

1183
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,040
Anything can happen
in the Home Department.

1184
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,320
Who will ask them?

1185
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,440
Mr. Sethu, I'll do one thing.

1186
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,680
I wrote down my assumptions
about the case in my diary.

1187
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,040
That's in my office.
I'll send it to you.

1188
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,880
I don't think
it will be very useful.

1189
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,320
It'd be worth a reference.

1190
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,200
Okay, sir. I stay
in the guest house. I'll leave.

1191
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:03,600
My wife is not here. That's why
I'm not offering you coffee.

1192
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,520
Oh, it's all right.
- Okay.

1193
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,600
Mr. Sethu.
- Sir.

1194
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,120
May you achieve what I couldn't.

1195
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,640
I wish you all success.
- Thank you, sir.

1196
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,200
Yes? Take a seat.
- Thank you.

1197
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,120
DySP Sethurama Iyer had sent this.
- Okay.

1198
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,600
KA Ousep, telephone number
326 and 324.

1199
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,080
Kilivathikkal Plantations
and Constructions

1200
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,880
telephone number 421.

1201
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,720
Joy Mathew, telephone number 376.

1202
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,560
K. Narayanan 388.

1203
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,640
Sunny Ousep 342.

1204
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,800
Are these numbers and names
in this exchange? - Yes.

1205
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,000
I need the details
of the trunk calls.. - Yes.

1206
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,600
...made from these numbers
from June 1987 till November.

1207
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:02,640
Well..

1208
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,400
Don't you have the duplicate
of the telephone bill? - Yes.

1209
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,240
A copy of that will suffice.
- That won't be an issue

1210
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,360
but it'll take time
to find the original.

1211
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,080
That's okay.
If you don't mind, I'll wait.

1212
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,200
Okay.

1213
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,560
Get me the keys
to the records room.

1214
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,520
Where do you stay, Mr. Harry?
- In the guest house. - Okay.

1215
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,840
'K.A. Ouseppachan and company.
Kilivathuckal planations.'

1216
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,240
Yes? What do you want?
- I wanted to see the owner.

1217
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,520
The owner is not here.
- Oh, God! I must see him.

1218
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,640
May I sit?
- Yes.

1219
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,160
Who are you?
- My name is Vishnu Nambuthiri.

1220
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,520
I'm from Memana house.
It's little to the north.

1221
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,160
I have done my Bachelors.

1222
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,400
I work in Tanjavoor bank.
- What should I do?

1223
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:10,880
Our bank is opening a branch here.

1224
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:15,640
So? - We need a few
good and respectable accounts.

1225
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,720
I heard that

1226
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:23,240
KA Ousep and Group
are the prominent ones here.

1227
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,800
You should give
some of your business to us.

1228
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,760
What's the use in talking to me?
You should talk to the owners.

1229
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,960
I met them.
They said they don't know anything.

1230
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,120
They said you are the one who
handles all their businesses.

1231
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,320
That's correct.
But

1232
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:42,960
Oriental Bank and State Bank
provide a lot of facilities.

1233
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,320
Also, Ouseppachan is one
of the directors of Oriental Bank.

1234
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,400
So how can KA Ousep and Group
give you business?

1235
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:54,880
So, all your business
is with Oriental Bank, isn't it?

1236
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,160
Most of it.

1237
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,280
And since we have
government contract

1238
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,600
we have business in State Bank too.

1239
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,240
You deal with State Bank too,
is it?

1240
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:06,320
Oh, Lord Shiva! You should
at least give us your SB account.

1241
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,040
It'll be a good sign.

1242
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,600
Yes.
We can think about that.

1243
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:15,320
So I have achieved
what I came here for.

1244
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:17,760
That's great!

1245
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,680
Did they suspect you?
- No, sir.

1246
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:23,920
So their main accounts
are in Oriental Bank, is it? - Yes.

1247
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:25,480
We'll go there tomorrow.

1248
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,160
Did you get it?
- Yes, sir.

1249
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,760
Most of the calls are from
Narayanan's number. - Yes, sir.

1250
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,360
So, Chacko was right.

1251
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,440
We'll meet Narayanan.

1252
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,280
What is it?
- Is Mr. Narayanan inside?

1253
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,880
Yes. But he's on the phone.
Who are you?

1254
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,480
Anirudhan.
We are from block office.

1255
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,240
We want to meet him.
- He's on the phone.

1256
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,680
Tell him it's urgent.
Go.

1257
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,840
Is it you, Doctor?
Why did you call me?

1258
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,800
Why are you worried, doctor?
Stay strong.

1259
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,280
Yes. They are staying
in the guest house.

1260
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,400
He's a Brahmin.

1261
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,200
Sethuraman,
or some other Raman.

1262
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:21,840
There are others with him.

1263
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,440
What? There are no idiots
among Brahmins, is it?

1264
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,040
There is nothing to worry about.
Times have changed.

1265
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,920
Everyone is paid these days.

1266
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:36,960
No. They didn't come here.

1267
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:39,440
Ouseppachan said
they didn't go there either.

1268
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,920
Oh, what will happen?

1269
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,960
Ouseppachan will have
to spend more money

1270
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,280
Yeah, right.
Are the CBI against money?

1271
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,520
Okay. I'll hang up now.
I'll see you later.

1272
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,800
Someone from Block Office
is here to see you.

1273
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,320
I was planning to come there.

1274
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,160
I heard that you got
TxD in the office.

1275
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,880
High yielding banana saplings
have arrived too.

1276
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,600
Mr. Pattabiraman is in
charge of that.

1277
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:07,560
Mr. Pattabiraman.

1278
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,320
It's not Pattabiraman.
It's Sethuraman.

1279
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,680
I'm a Brahmin. We are from CBI
and not Block office.

1280
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,200
Please, sit.

1281
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,480
You have a lot of contacts
among ministers, don't you?

1282
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,040
No. Who told you this?

1283
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:23,640
I'm a simple man, sir.

1284
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,720
Once, I lost
in an assembly election.

1285
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:29,360
That's my only connection
with politics.

1286
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,960
Haven't you called

1287
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:37,440
many ministers and their PAs
at their houses and guest houses?

1288
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,240
Who told you
such nonsense about me?

1289
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,960
I don't know any ministers.
And I haven't called them either.

1290
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,400
Is 388 your phone number?
- Yes.

1291
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:52,600
This is the duplicate copy of the
trunk call bill from this number.

1292
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,480
The numbers marked in red

1293
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,720
are the numbers
of various guest houses.

1294
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,480
We have evidence

1295
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,360
that the minister was there
on the day you called.

1296
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,760
The numbers marked in blue are

1297
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:09,160
the home number of ministers,
IG's and their PAs in Trivandrum.

1298
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,800
What do you say now, Mr. Narayanan?

1299
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,560
You are not
involved in politics at all, is it?

1300
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,640
That's the duplicate copy
of the trunk calls

1301
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:23,160
made from this phone
from June 30th to November 30th.

1302
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,080
Ouseppachan's daughter-in-law

1303
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,560
died on June 29th.

1304
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,600
And Ouseppachan
is your closest friend.

1305
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:36,360
This death was referred to
as a suicide very diplomatically.

1306
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,880
Doesn't any of these mean anything?

1307
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,160
Shall we go?

1308
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:53,800
You are driving on the wrong side.
Be careful.

1309
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,360
Didn't you say that there
is no need to worry?

1310
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,920
And that nothing will happen.

1311
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,040
Look at what happened now.

1312
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:02,960
What happened?

1313
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:04,760
If anything has happened,
it is all because of him!

1314
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:05,760
But what did I do?

1315
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,760
Why did you tell them that you
don't know any ministers?

1316
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,040
It would've been another problem
if I'd agreed.

1317
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,720
Rubbish! He is an idiot!

1318
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,720
Any person would say that he
knows some or the other minister

1319
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,920
at least for the sake of status.

1320
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,200
Nobody has said that having
a friendship

1321
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,280
with a minister is a sin.

1322
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,600
You are a social worker, a leader
and a business magnate.

1323
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,160
You will have connections
with the ministers!

1324
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,560
How does that matter to CBI?

1325
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,200
Yes, why should they care?

1326
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,240
You should have asked them
and not me.

1327
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,160
But you never asked them.

1328
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:35,080
Narayanan, do you know
where you went wrong?

1329
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,480
When they asked you initially,
you disagreed.

1330
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,880
When they displayed the evidence,
you had no words to say.

1331
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,680
They finely got you into a trap.

1332
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,360
If you had told them firmly
before itself

1333
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,920
they would not have questioned
you further.

1334
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,480
By the way, they will come
to interrogate you guys as well.

1335
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:50,920
They will move tactfully
to trap you.

1336
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,040
But don't fall into their traps.

1337
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:54,280
I wonder when they will
come to me?

1338
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:58,440
Even I am thinking of taking
a leave for two months.

1339
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:08,640
Let us hope that our first stage
of the investigation will end

1340
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:11,520
after inspecting Oriental Bank
and Ouseppachan's office.

1341
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:16,160
Sir, DySP Devadas has made a deal
to buy ten cents of land

1342
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,240
and a building near this main road.

1343
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,320
I got to know from a land broker.

1344
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:22,480
It might not be registered
in his name.

1345
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,600
We shall show you the necessary
records. - Thank you, sir.

1346
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:27,480
Please wait.

1347
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,080
I have presented the cheque again.

1348
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,040
He has gone for collection.
It might take some time.

1349
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:43,320
We will wait till then.

1350
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:44,760
Hey! Wait for a minute.
- Yes?

1351
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:50,000
That cashier's name is Gopalan,
right? - No.

1352
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,920
Then? - He is Ramananda Pai,
son of Mr. Devendra Pai

1353
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,200
doing the mosaic business.
- Okay.

1354
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:56,960
Why did you ask?
- Nothing. He looked familiar.

1355
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,600
Can you buy a pack of cigarettes?
- Let me ask the manager. - What?

1356
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,560
Hello! Were you searching for me?
- Who searched for you?

1357
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,760
I am the Gopalan you were
searching for.

1358
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:06,640
I was searching but not now.

1359
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,400
Excuse me!
- Yes?

1360
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,400
Can I get change for Rs. 100?

1361
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,680
Your name is Ramananda Pai, right?
- Yes.

1362
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,840
How is your father's mosaic
business going on?

1363
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,000
It is a bit dull now.
- Okay.

1364
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,200
Do you know my father?
- Of course.

1365
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,960
We are old friends.

1366
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:39,280
Just a month ago,
he had spoken to me about you.

1367
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:40,640
Did you say last month?
- Yes.

1368
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,680
But my dad passed away four
years ago.

1369
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,240
F-Four years?
Oh my, God!

1370
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,960
It feels like yesterday.

1371
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:52,840
Life is so unpredictable.

1372
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,360
By the way, Mr. Pai, do you
have foreign exchange here? - Yes.

1373
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,600
Okay. Do you have any problem
with the dealing?

1374
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,200
Can we take this ledger book?

1375
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,400
But sir, we need it for our
daily use.

1376
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,400
Do one thing, Harry.
- Tell me, sir.

1377
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,400
Make a note of the required
details. - Okay, sir.

1378
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:08,880
If required, you will have
to submit

1379
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:10,960
these books to the court.
- Yes, sir.

1380
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:17,000
By the way, nobody else should know
about our arrival here.

1381
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,520
I think you have understood.
- Okay, sir.

1382
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,640
Thank you very much.
See you, Harry.

1383
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,920
Mr. Vikram, now we will go
to Ouseppachan's office.

1384
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,400
I am not Vikram for the time
being, sir. - What?

1385
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:42,960
I am Vishnu Namboodiri.
- Oh, yes! Come on!

1386
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,000
Greetings.
- Oh, please come in..

1387
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,600
Please come.
How are you?

1388
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,280
Did you open the new branch yet?

1389
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,360
We will start today.
- Okay.

1390
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,960
Our manager has come along.
I wanted to introduce him.

1391
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:56,720
Of course!
With pleasure.

1392
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,080
Hello!

1393
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:03,160
I am Krishnan, chief accountant of
KA Ousep and Group of companies.

1394
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,200
I am K. Sethurama Iyer
from CBI.

1395
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:07,320
Oh! Central Bank of India.
- No.

1396
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,960
Central Bureau of Investigation.
- What?

1397
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,560
But he was talking about some
bank.

1398
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:17,280
N-Not at all. I am also from CBI.
Sub Inspector, Vikram.

1399
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:18,840
By the way, Mr. Krishnan

1400
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:21,600
we need to inspect your accounts.
- For what?

1401
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:24,960
Do you need to know the reason?
- No need. - Good.

1402
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,240
Vikram! You can proceed.
- Yes, sir.

1403
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,720
Sir, we have got a lot of problems
from sales tax

1404
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,920
and income tax people.
There was a raid last week.

1405
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:44,840
Do you know what happened?

1406
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,080
Mr. Krishnan, you don't have
to struggle speaking English.

1407
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,360
Malayalam would sound better.

1408
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,200
Yes, sir.
I am coming to Malayalam.

1409
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:54,800
Mr. Krishnan, get the ledger book
and cash book of '87 and '88.

1410
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,680
Those are with the auditor, sir.

1411
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,480
Will you give it yourself
or should I make you get it?

1412
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,920
No need, sir. I will bring it..
- Then go and bring it.

1413
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:08,760
Come on.

1414
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,920
Is that all?
Look, there is one more.

1415
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:20,800
Come with me.

1416
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,160
Sir, Rs. 30,000 was drawn
from the Oriental Bank

1417
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,480
with a cheque number 006848
on July 10, 1987.

1418
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:36,680
But it is not recorded
in this book.

1419
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,160
But, sir..
- Wait..

1420
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,440
Note that and seize the book!
- Yes, sir.

1421
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,720
What is happening? Who are
these people? - The CBI.

1422
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,320
Good that you came, sir.

1423
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:52,560
They were threatening me

1424
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,080
and were trying to inspect
these books.

1425
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,840
What is all this, sir?
- Didn't you understand?

1426
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,920
For what crime are you scrutinising
me this way?

1427
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:03,000
I have been tolerating
this for the last six months.

1428
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,720
First, it was Mr. Varma.
Then Mr. Devadas and now it is you.

1429
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:10,160
I have no peace at home
or in the office.

1430
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,960
What mistake have I made?

1431
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,960
A person died in my house.

1432
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,600
But how can you harass me
for that?

1433
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,840
I am also a citizen and I have all
the rights to know the reason.

1434
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,440
Mr. Ouseppachan!
There is no use of shouting!

1435
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:25,200
We will examine and finish
our inspection.

1436
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:28,200
Do not try to interfere
with our duties!

1437
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,800
Vikram, are you done?
- Yes, sir.

1438
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:33,920
Please move aside.

1439
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,320
Overall, a withdrawal
of Rs. 3,60,000

1440
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:38,680
is not recorded here.
- Okay.

1441
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,520
We are taking these books.

1442
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,880
You can approach the court
to get these back. Come on.

1443
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,640
Sir, these people..

1444
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,960
The first stage of this
investigation is over.

1445
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,800
Mr. Narayanan's telephone bills
and the misappropriations

1446
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:08,320
in the accounts of Ouseppachan
prove the corruption

1447
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,280
involved in the investigation
of this case.

1448
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:14,480
Tomorrow, we'll start
the second stage of our

1449
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:15,960
investigation at Ouseppachan's
house.

1450
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:20,120
Before that, we need to meet
DySP Devadas.

1451
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:22,800
Would that be of any help?
He's a brute.

1452
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,360
Let us see.

1453
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:29,280
Do you know about this Devadas?

1454
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,160
This happened when I was working
in Thiruvalla.

1455
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,640
Have you heard about the Kochi
murder case?

1456
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,400
A 14-year-old girl called Radha
was strangled to death

1457
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,680
for revealing her mother's
extra-marital affair.

1458
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:41,680
Devadas was the one who converted
that murder to suicide.

1459
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:05,200
Look who it is!
Please, come.. Take a seat.

1460
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:09,520
I had expected you earlier.
- I was a little occupied.

1461
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:12,360
The newspapers write about you
every single day!

1462
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:15,160
The CBI shouldn't be seeking
publicity, should they!

1463
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:18,600
Anyway. Would you like some
tea or coffee or perhaps some

1464
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,200
spiced buttermilk? I was just
asking as you are a Brahmin!

1465
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,240
Please, I am good.

1466
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:24,200
I went through
your case diary, sir.

1467
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,760
I've certain doubts.
- Feel free to ask me.

1468
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,160
Vasu, the driver,
was a key witness.

1469
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,880
I didn't find
his testimony in the case diary.

1470
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,440
I didn't find it necessary.

1471
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,760
There are a lot of contradictions
between the doctor's

1472
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,240
testimony and the autopsy reports.

1473
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:40,240
You could've questioned the doctor
at least to clarify those doubts.

1474
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:41,640
Really?

1475
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,880
Testimony is verbal and so, it
could be wrong.

1476
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:44,840
Even we can make mistakes.

1477
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:46,160
As per Indian
Evidence Act

1478
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,960
what's significant
is the post-mortem certificate.

1479
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,440
Because it is a signed document.

1480
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:54,600
One need not rack his brains
to this degree to determine

1481
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:56,320
if a death is a homicide
or suicide.

1482
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:59,240
If one is intelligent,
his instincts will help

1483
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,360
him figure it out.

1484
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,120
You aren't
answering my question.

1485
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:04,120
I'll repeat.

1486
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:07,360
I asked about the doctor who
conducted the post-mortem.

1487
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:08,960
I have explained
my conclusions.

1488
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:10,840
Okay, sir.
I shall leave then.

1489
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,960
There was a pivotal
evidence which you failed

1490
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:19,520
to take not of, sir.
- What is that?

1491
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:24,120
How come you failed to take not of
it since you are intelligent!

1492
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:33,040
Hello.
Is this Mr. Devadas, the DySP?

1493
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:34,360
It's me, Ouseppachan.

1494
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:39,400
The CBI team are on my terrace
with a couple of dummies!

1495
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,720
I've no idea what they are up to.

1496
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,840
Yes, I have informed
Narayanan as well.

1497
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,840
Please come over
to my place, sir. Okay.

1498
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,360
Is everything ready, Mr. Vikram?
- Yes, sir.

1499
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:05,240
Bring the dummy here.

1500
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,320
Is the weight of the dummy
the same as that of the dead body?

1501
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:12,880
Did you check it?
- It is correct, sir. I checked it.

1502
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,240
Wait..

1503
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,880
Imitate someone throwing
a body off the terrace. Like this.

1504
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:27,480
Keep it like this.
Like this. Yes, like that.

1505
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,440
Are you ready?
- Ready, sir. - Come on.

1506
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,040
Vikram!
Mark it. - Yes, sir.

1507
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,920
Harry, take the other one.
- Okay, sir.

1508
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:02,440
This dummy's fall should mirror
someone committing suicide.

1509
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:04,840
That's how you must throw it off.
Keep the position like this

1510
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:05,800
then throw it.
- Okay.

1511
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:08,960
Throw it.

1512
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:13,160
See the difference!

1513
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:18,280
Vikram, note the distance
between the two bodies.

1514
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:26,960
Dummy to dummy,
four feet.

1515
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:29,040
Dummy to the wall.

1516
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,360
First dummy. - First dummy to the
wall, 12.5 feet.

1517
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,440
Second dummy to the wall,
eight feet.

1518
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:57,960
How much is there?

1519
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:00,000
Dummy to dummy,
four feet. - Okay.

1520
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,960
First dummy to the wall,
12.5 feet.

1521
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:05,400
Second dummy to the wall,
eight feet. - Good.

1522
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:13,200
Over. Remove the dummies.
- Okay, sir. Remove it.

1523
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:17,240
Do you think the dead
body would've been found

1524
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,960
at the spot mentioned in the
inquest if it was suicide?

1525
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,320
No, sir.
- So.

1526
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:23,800
That is it, sir.

1527
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,760
Sir.
- What?

1528
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:44,160
CBI stands for
Cental Bureau of Investigation

1529
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:47,040
and not for
Cental Bureau of Idiots.

1530
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:50,400
Wait and watch. Things
will be moving real fast now.

1531
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:52,640
Hello.

1532
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:03,960
Sir.

1533
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,760
This is the spot where
Omana's dead body was found.

1534
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:18,960
Yes, sir.

1535
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:21,440
How far apart was the
dead body from the wall?

1536
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:23,520
12.5 feet, sir.
- Yes.

1537
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,560
The second dummy we threw
off the terrace.. - Yes.

1538
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:28,360
How far apart was from the wall
was its fall? - Eight feet.

1539
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:30,320
Okay.
So

1540
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:33,200
there is a difference of
four feet among the two falls.

1541
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:35,640
That is a very
important point.

1542
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,120
There is no way

1543
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:40,560
that she would've
fallen so apart

1544
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:42,160
from the wall
if it was suicide.

1545
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:44,240
What do you say?
- You are right, sir.

1546
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,440
What about you?

1547
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:48,520
I'm not trying to argue here.
- Okay.

1548
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,440
She would have probably
fallen here.

1549
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:58,320
Isn't it possible that
that she would have rolled over

1550
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,120
till there because of the pain?

1551
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,720
Oh, yes.
You are correct.

1552
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,160
We can
also think of it that way.

1553
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,040
Where are the photographs
of the dead body?

1554
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:08,760
It is in the room, sir.
- Bring it.

1555
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:13,960
Would the corpse have rolled over

1556
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,240
if it was thrown out
after she was dead?

1557
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:16,840
We don't know

1558
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:20,120
if she was thrown
off the terrace alive or dead, sir.

1559
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,320
As per your hypothesis

1560
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,640
the dead body fell
at this spot and would have

1561
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,080
rolled to this spot.

1562
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:37,480
In that case

1563
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,760
there would have
been blood stains over here.

1564
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,440
Do you find any blood
stains there in this photo?

1565
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:50,120
Do you see any?
- No, sir.

1566
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:54,600
Okay. That means, she would have
fallen at this point itself.

1567
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,880
What do you say?
- I am sorry, sir.

1568
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:59,240
Don't feel sorry. You asked
a very intelligent question.

1569
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,280
That is why we checked
these photographs now.

1570
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,320
We have come to another
conclusion as well.

1571
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:08,240
Omana was thrown off
the terrace after she was dead.

1572
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:11,760
If she was thrown out alive

1573
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:14,800
the body would have rolled
over as Harry said.

1574
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:17,520
And this distance would
not have been 12.5 feet.

1575
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:20,680
That means Omana's death

1576
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:21,960
occurred somewhere else.

1577
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,720
Bring her sari.
- Yes, sir.

1578
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:09,920
Did the autopsy reports mention
any injuries beneath her hip? - No.

1579
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,000
How come
there is a blood stain here?

1580
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:25,000
This sari must be sent for the
forensic test tomorrow morning.

1581
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:25,960
Yes, sir.

1582
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:49,320
You bloody CBI!

1583
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:53,600
You bloody CBI!
Come out!

1584
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:57,720
Come out here!

1585
01:38:59,120 --> 01:38:59,920
Hey, Brahmin boy!

1586
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:05,320
How dare you fool me by
showing a fake telephone bill?

1587
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,560
How dare you mess with me!

1588
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:12,320
Wait and watch.

1589
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:17,400
I will send you and your
stupid team packing from here!

1590
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:22,280
Not only do I have contacts
in Thiruvananthapuram

1591
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:25,880
but I have contacts
in Delhi as well.

1592
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:26,880
Come out here!

1593
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,160
Harry.
- What did you say?

1594
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:32,760
Don't you dare mess with me!

1595
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,680
Come out here!
Get down here!

1596
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,760
Harry, wait. - Get down here!
- Go inside, man.

1597
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:41,200
Go. - You!
- Vikram, go with him.

1598
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:42,920
Are you trying to scare me?

1599
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:46,760
You will tremble with fear!

1600
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:49,040
All of you will
tremble with fear!

1601
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,400
All of you would tremble
with fear at the sight of

1602
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:53,840
real men!

1603
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:58,880
All of you will tremble with
fear! I'll send you packing.

1604
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:00,240
I will go to Delhi.

1605
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:02,720
I will go to Delhi.

1606
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:06,400
I will go to Delhi.

1607
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:09,560
I will..

1608
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,200
I was obeying you.
Or else..

1609
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:16,000
Idiots shout for no reason.

1610
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:17,120
To provoke us.

1611
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:18,920
We should not react to it.

1612
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:20,120
That's not our job.

1613
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:21,760
Vikram.
- Sir.

1614
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:24,080
Did you go to driver Vasu's house?
- Yes, sir.

1615
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:25,760
His wife said that he is not there.

1616
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:27,680
Find him wherever he is.
- Yes, sir.

1617
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:28,760
Sir.
- Yes.

1618
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,120
How about a re-postmortem
of Omana's body?

1619
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:33,520
Yes, we will think about it.

1620
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:41,920
Hello, Sethuraman here.

1621
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:43,800
Sorry for disturbing you
in this late night.

1622
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:45,520
I've got news about Vasu.

1623
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:48,320
Where is he?
- Hotel Prashant in the town.

1624
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,000
He's in room number 108.

1625
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:32,320
What?
- I have something to tell you.

1626
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:33,400
Who are you?

1627
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:25,520
Did you observe him?

1628
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:27,680
There is no reaction on his face.

1629
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:35,240
See, he's taking that paper.

1630
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:36,720
'Omana murder case.'

1631
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:39,000
'Driver Vasu on the run.'

1632
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:46,960
'Omana murder case.'

1633
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:49,680
'CBI is in search of driver Vasu.'

1634
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:51,280
Smart!

1635
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:54,880
There is no reaction even after
reading news about him.

1636
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:01,560
'Omana murder case.'

1637
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:05,720
'CBI is in search
of Ouseppachan's goon, Vasu.'

1638
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:09,000
He is a hard nut.

1639
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:10,040
Won't crack so easily.

1640
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:20,600
Harry.

1641
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:21,520
Bring him to my room.

1642
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:22,840
Yes, sir.

1643
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,320
At what time did you
drop Ouseppachan home

1644
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:33,880
the day Omana died?
- After 10 p.m.

1645
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:36,440
How do you know?
- Because I had a watch.

1646
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,800
We have evidence

1647
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:43,600
to prove that Omana was murdered.

1648
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:46,440
We know what your role
was in it too.

1649
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:49,040
We might be able to help you

1650
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:50,800
if you confess the crime.

1651
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:54,240
If you become the approver

1652
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:56,960
the court will show some mercy
and lessen your punishment.

1653
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:00,600
If you have all the evidence,
why are you questioning me?

1654
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:02,120
Why don't you decide everything?

1655
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:03,240
Harry.

1656
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:04,440
Take him.

1657
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:20,800
Vikram.
- Sir.

1658
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:22,800
Don't give him anything
to eat or drink.

1659
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:24,520
Keep him in there for 24 hours.

1660
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:26,480
Let's see what the result is.
- Sir.

1661
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:28,320
Another thing.

1662
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:31,320
Vasu is not under CBI's custody.

1663
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:32,920
Do you understand?
- Sir.

1664
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:37,720
So search for Vasu at his
and Ouseppachan's house as usual.

1665
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:38,880
Sir.

1666
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,560
'Vinayaka Bank.'

1667
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:08,520
Who are you?

1668
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,120
Who are you?
- I am Vasu's wife.

1669
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:11,720
Is he in here?
- He is not here.

1670
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:13,800
Where is he?
- I don't know.

1671
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,240
It's been two days.

1672
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:17,640
And you are..
- I am from Vinayaka Bank.

1673
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:19,960
Vasu had taken a gold loan from us.

1674
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:22,600
I came to inform you that we'll
sell it if it's not claimed soon.

1675
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:32,960
I am taking this.

1676
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:35,520
Will this be problematic for us?
- No.

1677
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:36,800
I will give you a receipt.
- Thank you.

1678
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:41,840
I don't know whether it belongs
to my sister or not.

1679
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:43,760
Remove your bangle.

1680
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:46,120
Maybe they bought this for her.

1681
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:49,960
How about this?

1682
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:52,240
This belongs to her.

1683
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,640
Yes, I bought two bangles.

1684
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,400
One for each.

1685
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:58,720
From where did you get this?

1686
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:00,240
I will tell you.

1687
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:01,400
I am leaving.

1688
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:17,080
Whose ornaments are these?

1689
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:20,920
Speak.

1690
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:24,440
These belong to my wife.

1691
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:30,240
What about this?

1692
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:36,680
This..
I don't know.

1693
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:39,440
Vasu, don't try to hide anything.

1694
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:41,560
We have proof that this
belongs to Omana.

1695
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:44,240
We got it from the bank with
the other ornaments you pawned.

1696
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:46,720
This is more than enough

1697
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:49,560
to prove that you killed Omana.
- It didn't do it.

1698
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:51,120
Tell me the truth.

1699
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:52,120
What really happened?

1700
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:53,640
Speak.

1701
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:54,720
You have no other option.

1702
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:56,720
Speak up, Vasu.

1703
01:46:58,080 --> 01:46:58,880
I will.

1704
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:04,960
I'll tell you everything.

1705
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:07,960
Vasu.

1706
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:10,640
Vasu.

1707
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:14,600
Why are you here at this hour, sir?

1708
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:15,440
Come with me.

1709
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:23,600
Come with me to
Ouseppachan's house immediately.

1710
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:25,000
I just came from there.

1711
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:26,120
What is the matter?

1712
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:28,760
Well, Omana died.

1713
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:29,840
What?
Died?

1714
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:32,520
What do you mean?
- Sunny made a mistake.

1715
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:35,280
They had a fight.

1716
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:36,280
Sunny slapped her.

1717
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:38,680
He hit her on her pressure point
and she died.

1718
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:40,320
It was unintentional.

1719
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:42,040
What can I do, sir?

1720
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:45,000
We have to frame it as suicide
before anyone finds it out.

1721
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:48,600
But how?
- We will take care of it. Come.

1722
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:13,560
Come.

1723
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,080
Vasu.

1724
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:31,240
Fast.

1725
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:34,560
But throwing her from the terrace..
- Don't worry.

1726
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:36,840
We have made this decision
after a discussion.

1727
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:39,920
Make it fast.

1728
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,200
How about burning the body?
- That won't do.

1729
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:50,320
This is what really happened.

1730
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:52,800
Why did you pawn it
instead of selling it?

1731
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:54,400
I was scared.

1732
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:56,360
I thought they would doubt
me if I sell it.

1733
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:57,480
That's why I pawned it.

1734
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,240
Why did you pawn your wife's
ornaments along with this?

1735
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,080
I was in need of some money

1736
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:04,680
to buy a property. - Didn't
Ouseppachan lend you any money?

1737
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:07,200
He did.
But it wasn't enough.

1738
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:09,440
Does he know
that this bangle is with you?

1739
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:12,160
No, he doesn't.
- Okay.

1740
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:14,160
Vikram. - Sir.
- Take him.

1741
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:55,640
Sir. - Yes.
- The SP asked for you. - Okay.

1742
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:04,360
Sir.
- What is the status?

1743
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:05,920
Shall I demand
the arrest warrant?

1744
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:07,640
Not so fast, sir.
- Why?

1745
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:09,520
Now it is crystal clear.

1746
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:11,960
Isn't Vasu's
testimony enough for the arrest?

1747
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:13,280
That is not it, sir.

1748
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:15,280
Certain points
don't link together.

1749
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:16,880
Then tell me.

1750
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:18,360
As per Sunny's testimony

1751
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:21,320
he left home
at 8 o'clock that night.

1752
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:24,480
And Omana and Sunny
had a row before that.

1753
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:25,560
Sunny hit her

1754
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:27,840
on a pressure point,
and so, she died.

1755
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:31,080
However, Sunny wasn't
aware of it then.

1756
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:32,120
Yes.

1757
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:35,760
In that case, Omana's death
occurred around 8 p.m.

1758
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:37,440
Yes.
It is clear.

1759
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:39,440
As per Vasu's testimony

1760
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:42,280
Ouseppachan had returned
home that night at 10 p.m.

1761
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:44,240
He found
Omana dead in her room.

1762
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:47,120
And he calls his son,
son-in-law and Narayanan.

1763
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:50,200
To prevent his son from
being convicted of murder

1764
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:52,920
they framed the death as suicide.

1765
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:54,960
Now listen carefully.

1766
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:57,960
Omana dies at 8 p.m.

1767
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:00,320
Her body was thrown
off the terrace after 10 p.m.

1768
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:02,360
So there is a difference

1769
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:05,200
of more than two hours
between the two incidents.

1770
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:10,040
However, Omana's body was
found lying in a pool of blood.

1771
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:11,400
Yes. Correct.

1772
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:14,200
How long will it take for the blood
to start clotting after death?

1773
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:17,040
One hour. An hour
and a quarter at the maximum.

1774
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:19,560
Heat doesn't stay in a corpse
for more than an hour.

1775
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:21,920
The blood tends to clot as soon as
the heat vanishes from the body.

1776
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:27,040
So, how is it possible that her
body was surrounded

1777
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:29,920
by a pool of blood in spite
of being thrown off the terrace

1778
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:32,320
after nearly two
hours of her death?

1779
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:33,280
You have a point.

1780
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:35,360
Constable Chacko says

1781
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:39,160
that it had rained from
8 p.m. till 9:45 p.m. that night.

1782
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,960
So, it is obvious that her body

1783
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,840
was thrown off the terrace
after the rain had settled down.

1784
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:49,640
If it were otherwise, her body
would've shown marks of it.

1785
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:51,520
But there wasn't any
and for that, we have proof.

1786
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:53,960
Hence, we can believe

1787
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:57,280
Vasu's statement that Ouseppachan
got home by 10 p.m. that night.

1788
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:01,600
It was around 10:30 p.m. that Vasu
threw the corpse off the terrace.

1789
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:04,560
Yes. That means
that Omana's death occurred

1790
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:06,920
sometime between
9.15 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.

1791
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,800
What if Sunny had left home
at 9.15 p.m. or even earlier?

1792
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:10,920
We have no proof for that.

1793
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,960
Neither do they have proof
that he had left at 8 p.m.

1794
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:15,720
No, they don't. And that
is what we have to prove.

1795
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:18,240
Had Sunny left home at 8 p.m.?

1796
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:21,800
Had Sunny hit Omana and
was that the cause of her death?

1797
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:24,800
We've to find the answers to these
questions. - But as per Vasu's

1798
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:26,800
testimony,
we can suspect only Sunny.

1799
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,400
Sir, Vasu hadn't
witnessed anything.

1800
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:32,080
Vasu's
testimony is based on what

1801
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:34,280
Narayanan had told him
after Omana's death.

1802
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:37,720
So, if it wasn't Sunny's
assault that caused the death..

1803
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:41,080
Sir, can't we
suspect Mr. Ouseppachan?

1804
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:43,920
We can't say that as of now.

1805
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:46,040
That is yet to be found out.

1806
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:57,160
We are warning you, lady.

1807
01:53:57,320 --> 01:53:59,720
If you cry out of no reason..
- What?

1808
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:01,840
I can't hear you.

1809
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,520
How long have you
been suffering from hearing loss?

1810
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:05,880
What is he saying?

1811
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:08,120
How long have you
been suffering from hearing loss?

1812
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:09,880
What?

1813
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:12,880
Nothing.
You may leave.. - Okay.

1814
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:30,560
You don't suffer
from hearing loss, right?

1815
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:32,480
I can hear a little.

1816
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,280
A little?

1817
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:36,680
I mean, I can't follow
everything one says.

1818
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:38,280
People who cover up a crime
will be

1819
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:41,120
punished severely than the
culprits! So, tell us the truth.

1820
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:44,080
What really happened
on the day Omana died?

1821
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:46,400
Tell us..

1822
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:51,160
I was in the kitchen.

1823
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:54,600
That was when
I heard something fall.

1824
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:56,680
I came to the living room.

1825
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:58,760
Can you
recollect what time it was?

1826
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:02,000
Around 8 p.m.
- And?

1827
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:06,320
You should be taking
care of this house

1828
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:08,240
and not
rejoicing at your house.

1829
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:10,160
So?
Can't I visit my home?

1830
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:11,360
You can't leave now.

1831
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:14,440
No matter what, I will go
home tomorrow! - Why?

1832
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:16,360
I want to see my
father and sister.

1833
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:18,680
And why do you wish to
visit them all of a sudden?

1834
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:20,960
I will go.
- No, you won't.

1835
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:22,600
Father won't let you leave.

1836
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:24,240
I will go no matter
who tries to stop me.

1837
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:25,800
Yeah, right!

1838
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:28,120
I'm warning you.
I won't spare you.

1839
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:29,400
What's your problem here?

1840
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:31,760
You don't understand
mild language, do you!

1841
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:33,760
How many husbands am I
supposed to have in this house!

1842
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:36,280
That is what I want to know!
- Damn! How dare you!

1843
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:46,000
You won't be going anywhere!

1844
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:54,920
Why did you come upstairs?
- W-Well..

1845
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:56,640
Dinner.
- No.

1846
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:00,480
Where are you going?
- To call Ms. Omana

1847
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:01,600
for dinner.

1848
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,320
You need not bother
calling her.

1849
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:04,960
She'll have her
dinner if she wants to.

1850
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,080
You are the one who is
spoiling her.

1851
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:07,600
You fuel her mind
with wrong notions

1852
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:09,840
when we aren't around.
- I haven't said anything.

1853
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:10,800
Go now.

1854
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:15,560
You may keep it inside.
- Okay.

1855
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:34,400
This
is what had happened.

1856
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:38,200
You claim that you don't
know what happened next.

1857
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:39,240
The power was down.

1858
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:41,080
I went to the kitchen

1859
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:44,360
had my dinner and slept.
- Was it raining then?

1860
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:46,200
Yes, it was raining.

1861
01:56:46,280 --> 01:56:48,800
Do you know when the
power was back? - I don't know.

1862
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:51,680
When did Mr. Ouseppachan get home?
- I-I don't know.

1863
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,720
When do you usually go to bed?
- Before 9 p.m.

1864
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:57,640
When did you realise
that Omana was dead?

1865
01:56:58,200 --> 01:56:59,880
At the break of dawn

1866
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:03,520
Daisy woke me up saying
that the police had arrived.

1867
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:07,440
That was when I came to know
that Ms. Omana was dead.

1868
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:11,160
Had you informed Mr. Ouseppachan
about Omana's and Sunny's row?

1869
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:12,720
Yes. I did.

1870
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:16,240
So, it was him who
asked you to play deaf.

1871
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:18,360
Yes.
- Isn't that right?

1872
01:57:19,120 --> 01:57:20,280
What else did he say?

1873
01:57:21,080 --> 01:57:22,440
He said
if anybody were to enquire

1874
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:27,480
I was to say that Sunny and
Omana were in good terms.

1875
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,640
Don't you know that it is an
offence to hide the truth?

1876
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:31,200
They are rich.

1877
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:32,960
They are capable of doing anything.

1878
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:35,800
They may
finish me off if I say something.

1879
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:40,880
You stated that Omana asked Sunny,
'How many husbands am I'

1880
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:42,960
'supposed to have in this house?'

1881
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:45,320
Had Omana
said anything else?

1882
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:48,000
Did she mention
anybody's name? - No.

1883
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:51,520
Isn't everything you said true?
- Yes, sir.

1884
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:52,840
Don't let her go for now.

1885
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:54,520
Keep her under custody.
- Yes, sir.

1886
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:15,960
Hello?
Yes, this is Sethu, sir.

1887
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:18,200
I'll be there right away, sir.
Yes, sir.

1888
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:21,240
Harry..

1889
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:31,160
Come.
- Sir.

1890
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:34,040
I'm going to the office.
Find Mohammad.

1891
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:35,680
The guy Mary mention about.

1892
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:38,200
Mohammad, who works at
Ouseppachan's store? - Yes, sir.

1893
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:58,080
May I know who Mohammad is?
- What?

1894
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:00,480
I am Mohammad.
What's the matter, sir?

1895
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,440
I have some things
to ask you.

1896
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:15,720
What's the matter, sir?

1897
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:19,040
Didn't you send the sari for
testing? This is the report.

1898
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:25,480
My God!
This is a new development!

1899
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:32,920
These aren't the same.

1900
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:35,360
This is 'O' negative and
this is 'A' positive. - Yes.

1901
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:38,520
Omana's blood group was
'A' positive.

1902
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:41,680
How will we find out whose
blood group is 'O' negative?

1903
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:45,080
Shall we do something?

1904
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:47,120
How about we find out the blood
groups of all our suspects?

1905
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:48,960
That is not
as easy as you think, sir.

1906
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:51,520
As of now, the one whom this blood
belongs to, is unaware of this.

1907
01:59:52,240 --> 01:59:54,360
If we attempt to check the
blood groups of all our suspects

1908
01:59:54,680 --> 01:59:57,320
the person whom this blood
belongs to will become alerted.

1909
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:58,640
He may even abscond.

1910
01:59:58,920 --> 02:00:00,080
So, what can we do?

1911
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:06,400
'A week from tomorrow,
Health Service Officers'

1912
02:00:06,680 --> 02:00:10,240
'will conduct house-level
blood tests in Kumarapuram.'

1913
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:12,680
There's a way, sir.

1914
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:14,040
Let me enquire.

1915
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:42,520
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1916
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:43,960
I am Sethurama Iyer from CBI.

1917
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:46,680
What is it, sir?
- A few days ago

1918
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:50,280
wasn't there a blood check done
at Kumarapuram for malaria?

1919
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:52,200
Yes.
- Can you give me

1920
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:55,680
the list of people with 'O'
negative blood in that village?

1921
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:57,480
It will take some time.

1922
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:00,320
I will wait.
- Then okay. Come.

1923
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:07,280
Have a seat, sir.
- Okay.

1924
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:23,000
Since it is a rare group

1925
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:24,960
only three were there.

1926
02:01:26,440 --> 02:01:27,640
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1927
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:32,920
It's been a couple of days
since I heard from Vasu.

1928
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:34,640
Where does he stay?

1929
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:36,560
He said the name of some hotel.

1930
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:38,080
He said he would shift soon.

1931
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:39,880
Would the CBI have..

1932
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:41,000
How can that be?

1933
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:42,720
Didn't they come here yesterday
looking for him?

1934
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:45,440
Maybe he doesn't have
a phone at the moment.

1935
02:01:45,480 --> 02:01:46,360
That is correct.

1936
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:48,760
Father-in-law,
she is alone at home.

1937
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:49,960
I'll go home and come back.

1938
02:01:57,280 --> 02:01:58,400
Father-in-law,
police!

1939
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:37,160
Mr. KA Ousep,
you are under arrest.

1940
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:39,800
What for?
- For the murder of Omana.

1941
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:45,480
You killed her.

1942
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:47,480
And to make it look like suicide

1943
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:49,600
you threw the corpse
from the rooftop of this building.

1944
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:50,600
Mind your words!

1945
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:51,800
She killed herself.

1946
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:53,480
There's enough evidence for it!

1947
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:54,840
How will you arrest me, then?

1948
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:58,800
Harry, bring him.

1949
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:00,360
Come.

1950
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:19,000
Vasu has confessed.

1951
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:23,640
Why did you kill her?

1952
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:25,560
How did you kill her?

1953
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:27,080
I don't know.

1954
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:28,640
I didn't kill her.

1955
02:03:29,120 --> 02:03:30,680
Then why did you throw
the corpse down?

1956
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:33,840
That..
- What is it?

1957
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:34,800
Tell me!

1958
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:37,520
Tell me.
- I don't know anything.

1959
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:38,920
I called Vasu here.
That's all.

1960
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:43,720
Ouseppachan,
don't try hiding anything now.

1961
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:45,560
We have all the evidence.

1962
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:48,960
Come on.
Tell me what happened.

1963
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:51,680
Tell me!

1964
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:52,800
What had happened?

1965
02:03:56,960 --> 02:03:58,040
Don't ask anything to him.

1966
02:03:58,480 --> 02:03:59,280
I will tell you.

1967
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:01,960
I killed Omana.

1968
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:04,880
Are you trying to save your father?

1969
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:06,400
No, sir.
- Then?

1970
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:11,840
We had an argument that day.

1971
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:14,600
She said some things.
- Okay.

1972
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:16,680
I slapped her.
- Okay.

1973
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:18,440
With that, she..

1974
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:21,200
It is for saving me

1975
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:23,760
that they framed it as suicide,
sir.

1976
02:04:25,120 --> 02:04:27,800
But I never intended to kill her,
sir.

1977
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:31,160
It might be true
that you slapped Omana.

1978
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:33,920
But she did not die then.

1979
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:35,920
We have made that clear.

1980
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:39,960
So when did Omana die?

1981
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:41,800
How did she die?

1982
02:04:42,160 --> 02:04:43,120
Who killed her?

1983
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:47,320
Her murderers are amongst you.

1984
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:50,960
It'd be better if they confess.

1985
02:04:55,640 --> 02:04:57,360
Vikram! Bring that packet.

1986
02:04:57,400 --> 02:04:58,200
Sir!

1987
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:07,400
This is the saree that Omana wore
on the day of her death.

1988
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:11,160
This is Omana's blood.

1989
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:14,960
But this..
Is someone else's blood.

1990
02:05:18,240 --> 02:05:19,720
The owner of this blood

1991
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:21,480
must be the one who killed Omana.

1992
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:25,280
It's difficult to test the blood
of all the suspects.

1993
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:27,200
But I have proof.

1994
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:33,360
The blood is of the group
'O' negative.

1995
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:36,000
It belongs to a 34-year-old man

1996
02:05:36,080 --> 02:05:37,120
named Joy Mathew.

1997
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:42,400
Johny alias Joy Mathew.

1998
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:46,600
How did your blood
end up on Omana's saree?

1999
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:48,680
I don't know.
- You don't, do you?

2000
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:49,720
I don't know!

2001
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:51,720
Harry! Bring him.

2002
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:58,480
Now tell me!

2003
02:05:59,480 --> 02:06:01,120
He was the only one

2004
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:03,680
who saw you leave
this place at the night

2005
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:04,640
of Omana's death.

2006
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,600
How much did he pay you

2007
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:09,040
in order to keep it a secret?

2008
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:10,720
Rs. 25,000.

2009
02:06:11,720 --> 02:06:13,080
Joy Mathew alias Johny

2010
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:14,840
please tell the truth.

2011
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:16,680
How did you kill Omana?

2012
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:23,240
At the night of the murder

2013
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:26,080
I came here to discuss
some urgent matters

2014
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:27,640
with my father-in-law.

2015
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:35,680
Father-in-law!

2016
02:06:43,240 --> 02:06:44,120
Father-in-law!

2017
02:06:44,840 --> 02:06:45,680
Isn't anyone here?

2018
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:51,560
Omana.

2019
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:53,240
Omana.

2020
02:06:54,160 --> 02:06:54,960
Omana!

2021
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:56,080
Omana!

2022
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:01,480
Father-in-law!

2023
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:05,080
Leave me!

2024
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:09,240
Father-in-law!

2025
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:24,200
Let go of me!

2026
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:25,880
Father-in-law!

2027
02:09:16,760 --> 02:09:17,560
Why are you here?

2028
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:19,840
On my way back

2029
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:20,960
it started to rain.

2030
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:22,760
I sought refuge
at Sreedharan's hut.

2031
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:24,280
When the rain became heavy

2032
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:25,720
the hut started leaking.

2033
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:28,200
I came here to get an umbrella.

2034
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:31,000
You saw me arrive, didn't you?

2035
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:34,080
I did.
- So, you've been here for a while.

2036
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:36,880
Yes.
- Did you come upstairs?

2037
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:38,080
I did.

2038
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:44,360
Come.

2039
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:26,560
You had tried to molest Omana

2040
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:27,720
once before.

2041
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:30,360
As a result, fearing shame

2042
02:10:30,440 --> 02:10:31,800
without being able to tell anyone

2043
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:33,120
she had tried to commit suicide.

2044
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:36,520
Hadn't she?
You are an intelligent criminal.

2045
02:10:36,600 --> 02:10:37,400
Come on.

2046
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:50,920
Take him.
- Sir!

2047
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:57,360
Vikram, arrest them all.
- Yes, sir.

2048
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:14,840
Bye, Chacko.
- Okay, sir. - Okay.

2049
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:19,720
I am thankful to you.

2050
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:21,840
We doubted many people.

2051
02:11:22,040 --> 02:11:24,680
Because of you,
we found the real culprit.

2052
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:26,480
The Lord will bless you.

2053
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:28,880
Bye, then.

2054
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:33,000
Sir, he has a request.

2055
02:11:33,680 --> 02:11:36,360
That you must catch Sukumara Kurup,
the wanted criminal.
