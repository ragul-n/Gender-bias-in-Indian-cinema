1
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,141
In this universe,

2
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:45,683
The earth has a special place.

3
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:52,516
To every form of life born on this
earth, birth and death are a certainty.

4
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:54,558
As such, man too is

5
00:00:55,016 --> 00:00:56,850
born and dies

6
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,266
and is reborn.

7
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,975
Very few among them

8
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,891
Have memories of
their previous births.

9
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:19,683
In their previous birth...

10
00:01:19,683 --> 00:01:24,475
Their birthplace, home, family and
all these related to is remembered...

11
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:27,016
And for a lifetime,
it haunts them.

12
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:12,391
Mama...

13
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:23,266
Welcome to Karnataka!

14
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:26,933

00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,975
Roam around all over Karnataka...

00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:31,558
Take care!

18
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:40,141
Hello sir!

19
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:01,766

20
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:02,975
What is the news man?

21
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,308
Our Bharatha and Baahubali...
Have got bail!

22
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:06,391
Who has paid the bail man?

23
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:08,308
A foreign lady...
A foreign lady has paid the bail!

24
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,266
So they have link in
foreign lands too?

25
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:11,891
Who's she man?

26
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:05,266
Babe,Babe,Babe,Babe,Babe,

27
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:07,391
Where did you come from babe?

28
00:06:07,516 --> 00:06:10,058
Babe,Babe,Babe,Babe,Babe,

29
00:06:10,225 --> 00:06:12,183
Where did you come from babe?

30
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,891
A foreign bred girl,
a foreign bred girl!

31
00:06:15,016 --> 00:06:17,141
She came to shear a country hen!

32
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:19,725
Get ready, get ready!

33
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,558
Very soon we will dance along!

34
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:26,808
Babe,Babe,Babe,Babe,Babe,

35
00:06:26,975 --> 00:06:28,933
Where did you come from babe?

36
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:31,600
Babe,Babe,Babe,Babe,Babe,

37
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,100
Where did you come from babe?

38
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:36,475
A B C D, A B C D...

39
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:38,766
Watch the English chick
who has come here!

40
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:40,933
Taking out the chains
from the hands!

41
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:44,600
The whole village is jealous,

42
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:48,433
Babe,Babe,Babe,Babe,Babe,

43
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,558
Where did you come from babe?

44
00:06:50,683 --> 00:06:53,225
Babe,Babe,Babe,Babe,Babe,

45
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:55,975
Where did you come from babe?

46
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:07,350
This village had
only two tigers!

47
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:09,850
Bharatha and Baahubali!

48
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:12,225
Caught in a petty case,

49
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,725
They had become scapegoats!

50
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:21,766
They breathed as one and lived as one!
They were pillars of sacrifice!

51
00:07:22,016 --> 00:07:26,558
Showing too much concern for others,
The benevolent guys got locked!

52
00:07:27,058 --> 00:07:31,683
Where did you come from woman!
And got them out of the prison!

53
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:36,516
The tigers got back their clout!
Don't know in which life they owed you!

54
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:41,350
They are sure to repay you!

55
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:43,475
They are sure to repay you!

56
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,808
They are sure to repay you!

57
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:48,725
They are sure to repay you!

58
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:50,891
Do not keep any dues lady!

59
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:54,641
A B C D, A B C D...

60
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,933
Watch the English chick
who has come here!

61
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,100
Taking out the chains
from the hands!

62
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:02,766
The whole village is jealous,

63
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:24,266
The whole village is jealous,

64
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:32,558
Welcome ma'am

65
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,350
Hello!

66
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:34,891
Double room or
Single room ma'am?

67
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:35,641
One room.

68
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,433
Are you married ma'am?

69
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:38,183
No,

70
00:08:38,516 --> 00:08:40,391
Enjoy... Enjoy!

71
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:41,891
I need a guide...

72
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:43,683
I will arrange ma'am!

73
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,475
Could you please
speak in Kannada?

74
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,308
Do you understand Kannada ma'am?

75
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,766
I can even talk in Kannada!

76
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:49,933
I will freshen up and come,

77
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:51,058
Please arrange the guide!

78
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,433
Come ma'am...

79
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:21,266
We will do it ma'am!

80
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:22,891
After Marriage Peter!

81
00:09:23,183 --> 00:09:24,391
After Marriage?

82
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,683
You speak like an
old Indian woman!

83
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:29,433
Indians are way more forward
than you think they are!

84
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:31,850
They are way ahead
of Westerners!

85
00:09:32,308 --> 00:09:33,641
Look... I found this over here!

86
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:35,641
What will you say?

87
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:37,641
We need to wait till
we are married dude!

88
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:42,683
Okay ma'am!

89
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,391
Hello ma'am,

90
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,141
Hello Sir! Hello...

91
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:02,725
Hello...

92
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:05,766
I am Vasu but people
call me Kannada Vasu.

93
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:07,433
But I speak five
languages ma'am.

94
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,433
Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu...

95
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:10,683
I know... And also Malayalam!

96
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:12,016
I have seen it on Google...

97
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:14,016
That you Kannadigas,
except Kannada

98
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:15,516
You speak all the
other languages!

99
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:16,475
Is it true?

100
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,975
What ma'am, you have learnt
Google Kannada so well, wow!

101
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,141
But you are actually
right ma'am!

102
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:22,391
Look at you...

103
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,016
In spite of being from a foreign
land, how well you speak Kannada!

104
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,141
You are superb ma'am!

105
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:27,850
But there are people here,

106
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,475
Although they are born
and brought up here,

107
00:10:30,683 --> 00:10:32,016
They act as though
born to English.

108
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:34,933
Even to use the
washroom, But then...

109
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,975
They say 'Come ya! Go ya!'

110
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:39,808
But 80% of Kannadigas

111
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:40,808
Have a big heart ma'am...

112
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,308
It’s better that you
speak in Kannada only!

113
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,183
Thanks ma'am!

114
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:45,058
Means that they are
large hearted Ma'am

115
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:47,600
You poor Indians are only
talking about the heart.

116
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:50,350
For us, the heart is just
a blood pumping organ.

117
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:52,600
There is no emotion
related to that.

118
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,808
I would say ‘Everything
is in the brain'!

119
00:10:56,475 --> 00:10:57,225
Got it Sir.

120
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,683
You only value the head!

121
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:01,350
But what’s the point in
having only brains sir?

122
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:03,016
The guy who rules
the head is on top!

123
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:05,475
If he loses his mind...

124
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:06,975
Our heads will roll!

125
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,891
Isn’t it ma'am?

126
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:08,391
Yes...

127
00:11:08,516 --> 00:11:10,183
Isn't that why our
learned folk have told us,

128
00:11:10,475 --> 00:11:12,058
'Don’t walk with your head high

129
00:11:12,558 --> 00:11:13,933
but walk with humility!'

130
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:15,433
Isn’t it right ma'am?

131
00:11:19,475 --> 00:11:20,058
Hey boss,

132
00:11:20,516 --> 00:11:21,725
I’m really tired.

133
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,058
How much longer?

134
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,933
You need a brave heart
to climb a mountain boss.

135
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:26,641
The brain does
not have any work!

136
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:30,266
Ma'am this is a 57 feet
statue called Gommatteshwara!

137
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:32,558
This was built in a single
rock by Chamundaraya.

138
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:34,975
Every twelve years we
perform the Grand Anointment!

139
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,391
Look at the agricultural
fields and beautiful mountains!

140
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:38,183
Click two pictures of these...

141
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:39,641
Ma'am,

142
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,141
One selfie ma'am...

143
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:42,350
Okay!

144
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:44,016
Hey Boss!

145
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:44,975
How long?

146
00:11:45,683 --> 00:11:46,683
Aren’t you tired?

147
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:48,975
Man look at the
size of your thighs!

148
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,975
What are you eating?

149
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:51,100
Do you like my thighs?

150
00:11:52,308 --> 00:11:53,308
He likes my thigh!

151
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:56,391
My thigh is very
powerful ma'am...

152
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:57,433
It’s extremely powerful.

153
00:11:58,433 --> 00:11:59,475
Do you eat Karnataka’s cuisine?

154
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:02,100
Do you drink Mutton soup?

155
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,100
Do you eat Indian curry,

156
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,391
spinach? It's very nutritious.
Hey... Is it powerful?

157
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:07,683
Yes its extremely powerful sir!

158
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:08,475
I will teach you ma'am...

159
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,141
I will teach you
Karnataka’s yoga,

160
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:12,308
I will teach you
Karnataka’s acrobatics,

161
00:12:12,558 --> 00:12:13,433
I will teach you everything.

162
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:16,891
In our place, on seeing a rock,
only dogs raise their legs!

163
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:17,891
We don’t teach all this ma'am.

164
00:12:19,183 --> 00:12:22,058
Ma'am, we’ll see if we can get juice there.
Come ma'am... Come!

165
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:25,141
There, he lifted his
leg in front of a girl!

166
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:25,975
Hello sir,

167
00:12:26,183 --> 00:12:27,600
This is the power
of Karnataka sir!

168
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:28,766
Full of strength, Yeah!

169
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:30,308
Karnataka food provides
complete nutrition!

170
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:31,350
Come, come...

171
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,808
We need to go that far...

172
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:33,975
Just a moment!
If you get tired right now,

173
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:35,475
Do you know about
Bharatha Baahubali?

174
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:36,850
What exactly happened?

175
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,475
Ma'am, ma'am! Please…

176
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,391
In such a pleasant hour,
don’t utter such names ma'am!

177
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:42,433
I feel very hurt.

178
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:44,100
Those worthless fellows...

179
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:46,725
They cheated those who fed
them and are in the prison now!

180
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:47,558
Prison?

181
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:58,016
Trying to ruin others homes,
they are in prison now!

182
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,891
This is what they deserve!

183
00:12:59,016 --> 00:12:59,600
No, no, no!

184
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:01,350
I’m talking about
Bharatha Baahubali!

185
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,058
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

186
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:03,683
I’m talking about
Bharatha Baahubali only!

187
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:04,766
If you show your finger,

188
00:13:05,558 --> 00:13:06,475
They will swallow your hand!

189
00:13:06,558 --> 00:13:07,516
Be careful,
don’t ever stand in front of them!

190
00:13:09,058 --> 00:13:09,891
Interesting!

191
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,016
From his childhood,

192
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:14,433
He had been extremely naughty!

193
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:25,600
Hey,

194
00:13:26,183 --> 00:13:27,100
Listen carefully,

195
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,516
If you scratch on my car,

196
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:31,058
I will thrash you,

197
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:32,725
Did you understand what I said?

198
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:46,183
What guys...

199
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:48,141
You are still here?

200
00:13:57,641 --> 00:13:58,725
You are good boys,

201
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:00,100
you have a bright Future!

202
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:01,641
What are your names?

203
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:04,141
As you keep going,
you yourself will figure it out!

204
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:41,391
Who am I?

205
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:43,766
The son of Kashyapa Brahma,

206
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:45,933
Born out of the celestially
impregnated womb,

207
00:14:46,558 --> 00:14:48,183
Grandson of the
four-faced Brahma!

208
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:51,308
After overwriting his
fate from the Almighty

209
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,725
A brave heart who triumphed
over his own death!

210
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:56,100
He's the brave heart who
burnt the pomp of Aditi’s sons

211
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,016
And the courageous one who restricted
Aditya and made him bite the dust!

212
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:05,975
The daring one who stomped all
the existing worlds under my foot!

213
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,433
He is a decimal of the
great Hiranyakashipu!

214
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:10,558
Who is it?

215
00:15:11,016 --> 00:15:11,558
Father!

216
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:16,308
This is just Bhojaraja!

217
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:17,683
What a useless fellow!

218
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,183
What my dear?

219
00:15:21,058 --> 00:15:23,100
What are the brother-sister
duo accomplishing here?

220
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,391
It's Dubsmash Dad!

221
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,225
Instead of playing
these mad wretched games

222
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,100
Tell your brother...

223
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:29,766
Ask him to go to
the farm and work!

224
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,558
Useless fellow!

225
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:47,391
Hey Bharatha!

226
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:49,433
What is it, my dear...

227
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,225
Bharatha go to work.

228
00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:56,016
Hey Bharatha!

229
00:16:18,183 --> 00:16:19,058
What is this dude?

230
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:20,600
You are sweating profusely!

231
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:22,808
Are you tilling the field here?

232
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:25,600
Don't know if he will
sweat in the field!

233
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:28,225
But he has sweated a
lot to water the field!

234
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:29,808
They have grown up
only by his sweat!

235
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:31,891
I meant the crops dude!

236
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:32,433
That's what you think!

237
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,850
If you go to the
village and announce it,

238
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:34,766
They may believe your words!

239
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:36,225
As it is my wife...

240
00:16:36,516 --> 00:16:39,058
If anyone in the village has a baby,
she looks at me with suspicion!

241
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,891
She suspects you?

242
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:40,683
Dude...

243
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:41,808
Say what is believable!

244
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:44,308
You haven't got
one from your wife,

245
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:45,766
you will impregnate
the whole village?

246
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:46,600
Play quietly!

247
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:50,933
That's why I suggested dude...

248
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:52,516
After 10 at night,

249
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:53,933
your wife and you sit

250
00:16:54,308 --> 00:16:58,766
On TV watch a program called 'Before
play, after play!' See that!

251
00:16:59,891 --> 00:17:00,391
Brother,

252
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:01,850
Do they teach us to play Rummy?

253
00:17:01,975 --> 00:17:02,725
No dude...

254
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:04,516
They teach us to play
'Inside-Outside'!

255
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,558
Oh! That one!

256
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:08,975
Show!

257
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:10,141
Give, give,
all of you give the count!

258
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:11,725
Hey...
Mine is two, write that down!

259
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:12,225
Fine bro...

260
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:14,433
Mine is five!

261
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,266
Fine bro...

262
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:16,141
How much is yours?

263
00:17:16,516 --> 00:17:17,641
Write down, I'm book!

264
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:18,391
Fine, fine...

265
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:19,141
Book?

266
00:17:19,308 --> 00:17:19,975
Here too he flopped!

267
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,975
Rohan...

268
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:25,725
Rohan?

269
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:27,600
Who's Rohan here?

270
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:28,850
I have brought lunch for
you, come...

271
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,683
It's my wife,
none of you speak...

272
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:33,225
I'm coming,
I'm plucking the seeds!

273
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:34,141
Hey...

274
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:36,016
Isn't your name Range Gowda?

275
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:37,475
Yes dude, it is Range Gowda!

276
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:40,266
On TV After watching numerology,
my wife has changed my name!

277
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,266
Just by changing your name,
don't think she will get pregnant

278
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:45,433
And simply go to sleep!

279
00:17:45,516 --> 00:17:46,850
All the gruel will dry up!

280
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:48,100
You good for nothings!

281
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:49,058
Will have lunch and return!

282
00:17:49,683 --> 00:17:50,100
Hey...

283
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,183
Pay the money and go!

284
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,891
What?

285
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:53,141
Whose place is it man?

286
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:53,933
It's my land...

287
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:54,933
Don't I get a fee for the place?

288
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,766
Is this a classy club?

289
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,641
you have put feathers beneath and covered with a
mat and we have to pay fees for this, I believe!

290
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:00,808
Just shut up and pay the money!

291
00:18:01,016 --> 00:18:02,225
Come,
I will give you a cot as well!

292
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,100
Tell me,

293
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,891
Who will give you a place to
gamble inside the village?

294
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:05,933
Hey, rascal!

295
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:07,225
Run, run, run!

296
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:07,975
Prajju,

297
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:08,933
You too?

298
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:09,433
Aunty?

299
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,516
What are you doing here?

300
00:18:10,683 --> 00:18:11,308
Come home...

301
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:12,975
I will tell your mom
and jack you royally!

302
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:14,475
No aunty, I'm only
studying, studying!

303
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:15,141
Keep shooting, keep shooting!

304
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:17,683
With a cigarette in your
hand, you are studying?

305
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,433
This isn't mine aunty,
it belongs to brother!

306
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,766
Give it to me, it's mine dude!

307
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,016
Do you have a matchbox, aunty?

308
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:23,558
You said you were
plucking the seeds,

309
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:24,516
is this it?

310
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,183
No dear, I just came now,

311
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:28,433
Since they were all sitting...
So...

312
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:29,225
Hey Bharatha,

313
00:18:30,183 --> 00:18:31,766
Didn't you find
someone better to ruin?

314
00:18:32,516 --> 00:18:33,266
What is it now?

315
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:34,308
Bharatha Baahubali...

316
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:36,808
Decently all that my husband has
lost, if it is returned now, fine!

317
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:38,016
My dear boy,

318
00:18:38,391 --> 00:18:38,850
Rohan...

319
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:40,641
Tell your wife dude...

320
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,475
Were we all playing kiddish
games till now, here?

321
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:43,725
Hey! let it be dude...

322
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,350
Just to pass my time, I played!

323
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:46,766
You are a Smart one, right?

324
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:47,850
I had underestimated you!

325
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,100
You pass time really well!

326
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:50,058
Are you guys simple and
straight forward folk?

327
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:52,225
Distracting those who were to plough
the field and made them gamble?

328
00:18:53,058 --> 00:18:54,683
In the first place,
the man of my house is not straight!

329
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:56,266
Come home...

330
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:57,308
I will do it properly!

331
00:18:57,475 --> 00:18:58,766
Everything, you have to do...

332
00:18:58,766 --> 00:18:59,683
What will he do?

333
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:01,475
What did you say?

334
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,058
I will go home, I said!

335
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:04,641
Aunty has a lot of pimples...

336
00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:05,933
I too will come after
plucking the seeds!

337
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:07,600
What were you doing since
morning, you wretched man?

338
00:19:07,975 --> 00:19:09,558
Will you pluck the seeds now?
Don't hit me!

339
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,433
You have brought the mat from home too!
Zoom in, zoom in...

340
00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:16,616
Didn't you find
someone else to ruin?

341
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:18,616
You wanted my husband,
and my fields?

342
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:19,741
Bharatha Baahubali...

343
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:22,366
If you decently return all that my husband
has lost, it will be fine, or else...

344
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,575
They call farmers the
backbone of the country

345
00:19:24,783 --> 00:19:28,450
but youngsters to call themselves
sons of farmers they hesitate...

346
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:29,866
If this continues thus,

347
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:32,158
we will have to employ
robots for agriculture.

348
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:34,408
To discuss this
topic we have with us

349
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:36,491
One of the sharpest
intellects in the State

350
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:37,366
Somasundar

351
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:39,783
Tell us sir, what have you got
to say about the youth today?

352
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:41,200
What can I say, tell me?

353
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,491
if I am allowed to talk
then I can say something?

354
00:19:42,825 --> 00:19:44,491
Since then only you
have been talking...

355
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:46,241
If I do try to speak

356
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,158
You connect me to a caller and ask me
to speak! Sir, sir, sir, please sir!

357
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:50,700
After that again
if I try to talk,

358
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:52,450
you say will take a
break for a minute!

359
00:19:53,116 --> 00:19:54,616
If you want you just continue
talking yourself, get lost!

360
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:56,200
Sir, sir, sir,
please sit down sir!

361
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,366
Don't get angry.

362
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,616
This whole day is only for you.

363
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:00,866
Let's take a small break
and continue the discussion.

364
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:01,950
Take a small break!

365
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,325
What? A break again???

366
00:20:04,408 --> 00:20:06,158
Why is your bank burning yeah?

367
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,325
Bro... Why bro?

368
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:09,991
At least now listen
to my words bro!

369
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:12,991
Bother has fallen in love!

370
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:14,116
Call him.

371
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:15,075
Tell him not to come home

372
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:16,575
And sleep someplace
there itself.

373
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:33,825
Hi...

374
00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:41,200
Who the hell is it

375
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:42,283
Who turned off the TV?

376
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,325
We didn't turn it off.

377
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:44,491
The cable guy disconnected it.

378
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,866
I know...

379
00:20:46,783 --> 00:20:48,033
Nobody values me in this house,

380
00:20:49,075 --> 00:20:50,200
It's because I do not earn money

381
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:51,825
And I am just eating, isn't it?

382
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:54,283
Look mother,

383
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,491
I am just not interested
to plough the fields,

384
00:20:56,825 --> 00:20:57,366
Okay?

385
00:20:57,616 --> 00:20:58,533
Let's move to the city

386
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,950
And in just two months

387
00:21:00,116 --> 00:21:01,491
I'll make you go
everyone in a Swift car!

388
00:21:01,783 --> 00:21:02,116
Come on!

389
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:04,866
Those who went to buy a swift
car and left the village

390
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:06,241
In Bangalore

391
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:07,783
For Ola and Uber...

392
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,575
They are working day and
night in shifts as drivers!

393
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,575
He who is ready to break
his bones and work hard

394
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:15,491
it doesn't matter if it is
a village or if it is Delhi!

395
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:16,491
Dear Dad...

396
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:17,658
Just be quiet!

397
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,658
Farming, farming, is all you have
been dying for since so many years!

398
00:21:21,658 --> 00:21:24,616
Did you get the most prestigious
award from the government?

399
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:27,075
Siddha... The guy next door,

400
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:29,658
Unable to repay the farming
loan killed himself!

401
00:21:29,908 --> 00:21:31,408
He died... You know?

402
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:33,908
His children,
such small small kids

403
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:36,616
And his wife left
the village itself!

404
00:21:36,908 --> 00:21:37,616
She went!

405
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:40,533
Now she is living a
royal life in Bangalore!

406
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:41,491
Yes, yes!

407
00:21:41,908 --> 00:21:45,116
The kind of royal life she's leading,
everyone in the village knows.

408
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,325
Damn the people of the village!

409
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,366
When you are living among them,

410
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:50,408
They'll speak about
you behind your back!

411
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:52,325
Then if you leave
the village stand,

412
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:53,616
They will praise you
by putting up banners!

413
00:21:53,908 --> 00:21:55,491
This is how the world works.
Know that!

414
00:21:56,075 --> 00:21:57,533
Let me tell you
something, listen!

415
00:21:57,741 --> 00:21:59,033
People who leave the
village only flourish!

416
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,700
Do you see?

417
00:22:00,616 --> 00:22:03,908
To walk on crooked lanes,
the boss has decided!

418
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,366
Dad!

419
00:22:07,741 --> 00:22:09,033
Look at him laughing!
Bloody fool!

420
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:20,075
Bloody idiot!

421
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,200
What kind of local liquor did you give?
My gut is wrenching man!

422
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,366
Duplicate whatever you want but
please leave liquor alone guys!

423
00:22:29,991 --> 00:22:30,783
Hello Doctor...

424
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:31,825
Yes,

425
00:22:32,158 --> 00:22:32,741
What do you want?

426
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:33,533
It's...

427
00:22:33,741 --> 00:22:36,075
Last night I drank too much
and I am vomiting a lot.

428
00:22:36,241 --> 00:22:38,908
He give me local liquor and I drank
it in a hurry without realizing.

429
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,241
My head is hammering!

430
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:41,366
What should I take?

431
00:22:41,575 --> 00:22:43,158
When you take excess of alcohol,

432
00:22:43,283 --> 00:22:44,616
Your body will become dry!

433
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,450
And also that will cause a lot
of side-effects on your body..

434
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,866
Like headache, vomiting sensation,
sometimes it leads to diarrhea!

435
00:22:53,616 --> 00:22:54,158
Die?

436
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:55,700
Not die, diarrhea!

437
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,408
What you are saying is
going beyond my head!

438
00:22:58,408 --> 00:23:00,450
Just tell me the name of some
tablet so that I can swallow it!

439
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:03,991
My mom, to dispense free advice

440
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:06,325
Didn't pass MBBS without paying

441
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,325
if you want come to the clinic
and pay and get a prescription.

442
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:11,533
Come to my clinic, idiot!

443
00:23:13,116 --> 00:23:13,616
What a stupid doctor!

444
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:17,241
You don't even know what to
prescribe and have so much to say.

445
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,075
Why are you standing
like a ghost dad?

446
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:22,241
Why the hell did
you drink my liquor?

447
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:23,866
Why would I drink your liquor?

448
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,366
I heard everything you
said over the phone.

449
00:23:26,116 --> 00:23:28,908
You consume my entire lot of liquor
up to your neck and you are puking.

450
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,533
Now I am going to finish you.

451
00:23:31,283 --> 00:23:32,658
Mummy! Mummy!
Where the hell are you running!

452
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:34,450
Look your husband is coming to hit me
After drinking, you are trying to run away?

453
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:36,033
Mother, mummy!
Stand there I say!

454
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:37,700
Dad that's a machete, damn you.
Where are you trying to run?

455
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:40,408
What the hell is this?
Stand right there, stand!

456
00:23:40,408 --> 00:23:41,325
Why did you come here?

457
00:23:42,366 --> 00:23:43,325
Why are you behaving like this?

458
00:23:43,491 --> 00:23:44,741
What mistake did my son do?

459
00:23:44,908 --> 00:23:47,366
All the liquor that I had kept in the
attic, this bugger has consumed everything.

460
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:48,658
He will get it!

461
00:23:48,908 --> 00:23:49,366
Stand still!

462
00:23:49,741 --> 00:23:52,283
Even if it was consumed, it was my son
who did it and not the neighbour, right?

463
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:52,908
Son,

464
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,241
Why the hell would
you drink his liquor?

465
00:23:55,408 --> 00:23:56,408
Like his liquor is some scotch.

466
00:23:56,408 --> 00:23:58,033
His liquor tastes like the
crap that you feed the cows.

467
00:23:58,033 --> 00:23:58,741
Why would I touch that?

468
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,116
Did you hear that?

469
00:24:00,866 --> 00:24:02,741
Even before talking,
you bring a machete, you mad fellow!

470
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,575
All this is happening
because of you,

471
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:05,783
because of the
way you spoil him!

472
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:08,158
Next time you come near
my bottle of liquor

473
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,283
And then you will see!

474
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:11,241
I will chop your head
into pieces and throw it!

475
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,575
You will have it bad.
I will come back.

476
00:24:12,575 --> 00:24:13,908
Pieces it seems. Get lost man!

477
00:24:36,783 --> 00:24:37,658
Send them inside.

478
00:24:37,991 --> 00:24:38,450
Okay sir.

479
00:24:41,658 --> 00:24:42,533
Who is the responsible
person here?

480
00:24:42,533 --> 00:24:42,825
Go inside.

481
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:43,450
Ok!

482
00:24:45,241 --> 00:24:45,866
Hello sir,

483
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:47,533
We...

484
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:49,283
We have come to
join the military.

485
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:49,950
Good.

486
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:52,783
Indian Army needs
youths like you...

487
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,825
Really I am proud of you both.

488
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:56,991
Go finish the formalities!

489
00:24:57,075 --> 00:24:57,908
What formalities,

490
00:24:58,116 --> 00:24:59,116
let's keep that
aside for a minute.

491
00:24:59,283 --> 00:25:00,616
Sir, if we are taking up the job

492
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:01,991
We have some demands.

493
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:03,491
Demands?

494
00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:04,741
What's that?

495
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:06,783
As soon as it is
eight in the evening,

496
00:25:06,825 --> 00:25:08,075
You have to provide a
full bottle of liquor sir,

497
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:09,408
The brand doesn't matter!

498
00:25:10,366 --> 00:25:11,616
When there is war and the such,

499
00:25:11,741 --> 00:25:12,866
You have to give us incentive!

500
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:15,325
Depends on the
country and the war...

501
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,158
If it's against Pakistan
then we want a bonus!

502
00:25:19,283 --> 00:25:20,366
What the hell are
you asking for?

503
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:22,116
You are joining to
safeguard the nation!

504
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,950
Can you ask such things?

505
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:23,991
You think they will give these?

506
00:25:24,241 --> 00:25:24,700
Dumb fellow!

507
00:25:25,575 --> 00:25:26,450
Sir, you don't give
any of these things,

508
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:27,491
But when there is a war

509
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:29,200
You give us both
holidays, it's enough!

510
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:30,700
Ok!

511
00:25:30,783 --> 00:25:31,241
And then...

512
00:25:31,533 --> 00:25:33,950
In extreme cold or under the scorching
sun... Please don't make me stand!

513
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,783
My dad has brought me
up very delicately!

514
00:25:36,283 --> 00:25:36,783
And...

515
00:25:36,908 --> 00:25:39,116
We also heard that military training...
Is like torture.

516
00:25:40,408 --> 00:25:41,241
I am afraid we
can't do all that.

517
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:42,950
Put us directly in the border,

518
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:44,241
We will stand with a gun!

519
00:25:44,741 --> 00:25:45,241
Is it okay?

520
00:25:49,158 --> 00:25:49,658
Constable!

521
00:25:49,825 --> 00:25:50,200
sir!

522
00:25:54,116 --> 00:25:54,533
Yes sir!

523
00:25:54,825 --> 00:25:55,491
Give the gun to him.

524
00:25:58,741 --> 00:25:59,158
Take it.

525
00:26:01,575 --> 00:26:02,450
Hold it, hold it!

526
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:06,491
You don't have the
strength to hold the gun

527
00:26:07,825 --> 00:26:09,658
And you all want incentives?

528
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,075
You said you can't handle
heat and cold weather, right?

529
00:26:13,825 --> 00:26:15,741
Where our soldiers
are stationed,

530
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,991
do you know how cold it is?

531
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,616
It is -16Â°C!

532
00:26:21,408 --> 00:26:22,825
I will give in to
all your demands!

533
00:26:23,408 --> 00:26:24,366
For just one day...

534
00:26:25,741 --> 00:26:27,241
Stand there and work!

535
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,866
Do you have the guts?

536
00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:31,408
Our soldiers...

537
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:34,908
Be it night, day,
cold, rain, wings!

538
00:26:34,908 --> 00:26:36,741
Irrespective of these
conditions are doing their duty!

539
00:26:38,658 --> 00:26:40,991
They are not getting great
salaries like the software guys

540
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:45,991
But they are still
sacrificing for the nation!

541
00:26:47,991 --> 00:26:50,491
Do you guys even know the
meaning of the word sacrifice?

542
00:26:51,658 --> 00:26:53,241
Get lost you
buggers, bugger off.

543
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:53,741
Go guys.

544
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,450
Go to the military hotel.

545
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,075
Go and eat ragi balls!

546
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:01,658
Sorry.

547
00:27:07,366 --> 00:27:08,116
Are you joining too?

548
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,866
We'll meet at the border.

549
00:27:08,908 --> 00:27:09,450
We are selected.

550
00:27:27,116 --> 00:27:28,200
Who the hell made the statue?

551
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,075
Malla sir...

552
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,866
Is it nice sir?

553
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:32,283
Is it me or your father?

554
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:33,283
Why sir?

555
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:35,116
You can't even tell it's me man!

556
00:27:35,241 --> 00:27:36,033
That's why sir,

557
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:37,616
Down there in big
letters, we put your name.

558
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:38,491
You bugger!

559
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:39,908
So how much did you siphon off?

560
00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:42,116
So is mutton prepared
at your place tonight?

561
00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:43,366
No, it's chicken sir.

562
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:56,616
Look there, the head fell off.

563
00:28:00,825 --> 00:28:01,366
Shut your mouths!

564
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:03,950
What is this headmaster?

565
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:05,866
Who made you do that?

566
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:07,158
Is that even possible sir?

567
00:28:07,283 --> 00:28:08,741
I've no idea how
this happened sir!

568
00:28:08,866 --> 00:28:09,950
I swear on my mother
I don't know sir!

569
00:28:10,075 --> 00:28:11,950
If you don't know anything,
then how did the damn head fall off?

570
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:14,200
There is only this one
school in the entire village,

571
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,950
To help the kids study well
I do so much for your school.

572
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:20,241
In my memory, I wanted this small statue
and on that too, you cast your eyes?

573
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:21,533
Look,

574
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,616
I want a detailed report
on how this happened!

575
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:25,991
Otherwise I will take away all
that I have given and go away...

576
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,783
Remember that!

577
00:28:27,658 --> 00:28:28,033
Sir,

578
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:29,825
When you said remember,
I recollected sir!

579
00:28:30,158 --> 00:28:31,325
Anyway in our school,

580
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:32,575
We have CCTV cameras sir!

581
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:33,741
CCTV cameras?

582
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:35,533
In our school campus,

583
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,908
We have two sandalwood trees,

584
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:38,325
They have put it for
safety purpose sir.

585
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,033
We are going to get
caught now dude!

586
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:41,950
No, they cannot make out our
faces, don't worry!

587
00:28:42,116 --> 00:28:45,116
For these poor kids, to attend nature
calls urgently there are no proper toilets

588
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:46,741
and he's calling it a
campus, it seems, campus!

589
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:48,408
Now show me where it is!
Come on!

590
00:28:48,408 --> 00:28:49,116
Please come.

591
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,116
Naganna is known to the entire
village as a godfather only!

592
00:28:54,575 --> 00:28:55,200
Poor guy,

593
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:57,658
He wanted to stand for the next
local governing body elections too.

594
00:28:58,075 --> 00:28:59,741
With camera man Tommy...

595
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,866
This is Kumar from

596
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:01,825
TV Right!

597
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:02,408
Sir,

598
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,408
It's not Tommy, it's Tony sir!

599
00:29:09,325 --> 00:29:10,033
Hold this, hold this!

600
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:16,158
Shall I jump now?

601
00:29:21,491 --> 00:29:22,408
Is this a jump?

602
00:29:22,408 --> 00:29:23,450
How was the jump?

603
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,825
You should go to
the Olympics man.

604
00:29:25,908 --> 00:29:26,700
Oh my God,

605
00:29:26,825 --> 00:29:28,533
It's a ghost,
ghost, ghost, ghost!

606
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:28,991
Where dude?

607
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:30,408
Look over there,

608
00:29:30,408 --> 00:29:31,950
There is someone wearing
white clothes and standing!

609
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,866
It's a ghost man!

610
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,033
It's not a ghost man,

611
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,825
it's a statue, statue...
Come man.

612
00:29:39,075 --> 00:29:39,950
Is it....

613
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,241
Who the hell is this?
I can't make out!

614
00:29:50,283 --> 00:29:50,991
It is him man...

615
00:29:51,616 --> 00:29:52,783
Godfather Naganna.

616
00:29:53,075 --> 00:29:54,158
Naganna!

617
00:29:57,075 --> 00:30:00,075
You died Naganna...

618
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:01,991
Here drink, drink, drink!

619
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:04,825
As we are playing cards all day

620
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:09,908
We have no idea who is alive
or dead in the village Naganna!

621
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:10,908
He is not dead bro...

622
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,200
I saw him just this
morning he is alive!

623
00:30:13,408 --> 00:30:16,783
Then why this bloody guys statue is here
what has he achieved for this honor?

624
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:17,866
See dude...

625
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,283
To the kids in the school he gave
some pencils and rubber bands

626
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:25,283
He calls himself Godfather,
Godfather and roams around the village!

627
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:27,491
Bharatha...

628
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:29,533
What does godfather mean?

629
00:30:30,866 --> 00:30:32,241
The one who gives birth
to you is your father

630
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,783
And the one who watches from
behind your back is Godfather!

631
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:36,408
Really?

632
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,658
Wow!

633
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:42,908
Then there is no one
behind your back?

634
00:30:43,616 --> 00:30:45,075
When we stand on our feet

635
00:30:45,075 --> 00:30:46,866
And go about our
work with bent heads,

636
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:47,866
Why do we need a godfather?

637
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,200
They need only God,

638
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:52,241
God is our dad!

639
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:53,616
Shut up will you?

640
00:30:54,075 --> 00:30:55,575
Since when have you ever
stood on your own feet

641
00:30:55,575 --> 00:30:57,741
And bent your head
and got anything done?

642
00:30:58,491 --> 00:31:00,408
How the hell do you think we play cards?
With our heads held up high?

643
00:31:00,908 --> 00:31:02,116
Donâ€™t we bend
our heads and play?

644
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,450
You are somewhat right in what
you are saying. In that case,

645
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:10,741
Why the hell do we need
this fellow Godfather.

646
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:13,575
You loafer,

647
00:31:14,616 --> 00:31:15,741
Godfather!

648
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:17,825
What is it,
what are you doing man?

649
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:38,575
Go man,

650
00:31:39,283 --> 00:31:40,366
Go outside and lock the
door on your way out!

651
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:40,991
Ok sir,

652
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:42,283
You buggers,

653
00:31:42,783 --> 00:31:43,700
You will get it now!

654
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:48,700
When did this fellow see us?

655
00:31:56,491 --> 00:31:57,408
He's crying.

656
00:32:00,366 --> 00:32:01,408
Why did you boys do this?

657
00:32:01,616 --> 00:32:04,075
To win this one election,
I am working so hard!

658
00:32:04,741 --> 00:32:06,200
why did you turn it negative?

659
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,616
Just this one election,
let me win, spare me guys!

660
00:32:11,616 --> 00:32:12,283
What do you both want?

661
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:13,491
Do you want alcohol?

662
00:32:13,658 --> 00:32:14,408
Do you want alcohol guys?

663
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:16,116
Yes bro, yes bro!

664
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,491
I own so many bars guys,

665
00:32:19,116 --> 00:32:20,741
you don't have to pay a pie,
drink all you want daily!

666
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:21,575
Okay brother.

667
00:32:23,283 --> 00:32:23,783
What is it with you?

668
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,116
Is it pride?

669
00:32:25,866 --> 00:32:26,783
No way, it's got nothing
to do with all that!

670
00:32:27,908 --> 00:32:28,783
You do one thing,

671
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:31,033
you both join my
bar as bouncers.

672
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,241
I will pay a salary every month

673
00:32:33,783 --> 00:32:35,075
And you can drink
as much as you want.

674
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:35,908
Is that okay?

675
00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:37,950
Sir this is more
than enough brother.

676
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,616
I am totally okay with it!

677
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:39,950
What about you Bharatha?

678
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:41,866
What is this man?

679
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,741
You're not saying anything.

680
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:43,616
Is it okay with you?

681
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,908
Give me another one.

682
00:32:51,075 --> 00:32:51,533
What?

683
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,033
First pay up for what you had so
far and then I'll get you more.

684
00:32:54,991 --> 00:32:57,533
When I came into this bar,
it's as if Goddess Lakshmi is here!

685
00:32:57,825 --> 00:32:59,450
And you dare ask me for money?

686
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:00,450
Pluck it!

687
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:01,450
Pluck it!

688
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:03,075
What should I pluck?
And you dare ask me for money?

689
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,366
What are you staring
at my face for?

690
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:05,200
Pluck mine!

691
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:07,158
First pay up and
then I'll pluck!

692
00:33:07,158 --> 00:33:08,741
I'm asking you to pluck!
What's going on here?

693
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:09,283
Sir,

694
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,200
He is not paying and is
creating a lot of ruckus.

695
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:12,533
You are also here.

696
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:13,158
Pluck!

697
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:13,741
Come,

698
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,408
pluck!

699
00:33:14,658 --> 00:33:15,783
Why are you staring at my face?

700
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,450
Pluck!

701
00:33:16,658 --> 00:33:17,283
Pluck!

702
00:33:19,991 --> 00:33:20,991
So you guys have also come,

703
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:21,866
You too come guys,

704
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:22,616
You too pluck!

705
00:33:22,908 --> 00:33:23,575
Come on!

706
00:33:23,658 --> 00:33:24,158
Come on!

707
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,408
You too pluck!

708
00:33:25,616 --> 00:33:26,450
Come on man!

709
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:40,408
Since then I have been
telling you to do this only.

710
00:33:41,158 --> 00:33:41,908
What was his bill amount?

711
00:33:42,241 --> 00:33:43,575
Sir, Rs.10.

712
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,783
See,

713
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:46,908
The magic of the twin bulls!

714
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,241
To settle a Rs.10 bill,

715
00:33:57,158 --> 00:33:58,241
Fou guys broke
four beer bottles!

716
00:33:59,616 --> 00:34:00,408
You guys are not needed here.

717
00:34:01,075 --> 00:34:02,283
There is another secret place,

718
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,200
I'll show you.

719
00:34:03,325 --> 00:34:03,658
Come on!

720
00:34:21,825 --> 00:34:26,658
While playing hide and seek...
Time has just passed us by!

721
00:34:26,658 --> 00:34:28,741
Bharatha, what's with you man?

722
00:34:30,825 --> 00:34:35,283
While playing hide and seek...
Time has just passed us by!

723
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:39,200
Man and woman are
now equal now dude!

724
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:43,700
Ladies also need
a full bottle now!

725
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:45,325
Yes, you are right!

726
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:45,825
Come on!

727
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:59,908
While playing hide and seek...
Time has just passed us by!

728
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:04,158
It's no longer a matter of
quarter and half or full!

729
00:35:04,283 --> 00:35:07,991
Ladies also need
a full bottle now!

730
00:35:08,825 --> 00:35:13,366
Be it happiness or sadness
we totally need beer!

731
00:35:13,658 --> 00:35:18,033
So what if mother-in-law or father-in-law
are here, We just don't care!

732
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:24,450
Where has our world come to now!

733
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,325
Pick up a bottle for your
wife and be on your way!

734
00:35:29,116 --> 00:35:33,491
Where has our world come to now!

735
00:35:33,741 --> 00:35:38,116
Pick up a bottle for your wife and be on
your way, on your way, be on your way!

736
00:35:38,408 --> 00:35:39,950
I need one for my mother-in-law
too, give me man!

737
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:04,950
After marrying a drunkard
husband, women used to complain!

738
00:36:05,408 --> 00:36:08,533
Going to the police station,
they would give complaints!

739
00:36:09,908 --> 00:36:13,866
For small amounts of money,
they used to steal from him!

740
00:36:14,283 --> 00:36:17,991
They would get caught then
and get thrashed royally!

741
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:22,158
Where the hell is he?
Let him touch just me now and see.

742
00:36:22,575 --> 00:36:27,075
I have the divorce papers in my
hand, Shall I sign it?

743
00:36:27,783 --> 00:36:32,033
Be it any hardship or hard
times, we will face it all!

744
00:36:32,325 --> 00:36:36,533
With or without her husband,
we are our own boss here!

745
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:43,241
Where has our world come to now!

746
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:48,116
We now have to press
our wives feet!

747
00:36:48,366 --> 00:36:48,908
Press it man,

748
00:36:49,283 --> 00:36:49,908
Press it properly!

749
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:04,825
To 108 Gods,
they used to run around taking vows!

750
00:37:05,866 --> 00:37:09,325
For husbands to stop
drinking, women used to pray!

751
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,658
At the very smell of alcohol,
they twisted their faces!

752
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:18,241
If the husband comes home drunk,
they made him to sleep alone!

753
00:37:18,575 --> 00:37:22,700
Where is that husband?
Come bring me a bottle!

754
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:27,533
To have along with it,
bring some pickles fast!

755
00:37:28,366 --> 00:37:32,283
Be it whiskey, be it Rum!
Any other brand is fine,

756
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:37,450
Get just a single bottle.
Don't expect me to share it, careful!

757
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:47,075
Where has our world come to now!
There is no escape for the husband.

758
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:57,700
Where has our world come to now! If it is like
this, there is no escape for the husband!

759
00:37:58,283 --> 00:37:58,908
You say so?

760
00:38:22,991 --> 00:38:23,950
It's only you...

761
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:26,158
Who has understood me correctly.

762
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:27,658
You are the only one!

763
00:38:28,116 --> 00:38:30,491
Without even eating,
you keep waiting for me...

764
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:31,241
Take it,

765
00:38:32,158 --> 00:38:32,616
Take it,

766
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,158
I've got you a Jio SIM card

767
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,283
It's unlimited,

768
00:38:35,491 --> 00:38:36,408
You talk for hours.

769
00:38:36,616 --> 00:38:37,158
Enjoy!

770
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:38,325
Mummy,

771
00:38:39,908 --> 00:38:40,658
This is for you!

772
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,241
Dad...

773
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:46,158
Give it to him,

774
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:47,825
let him wear it and enjoy.

775
00:38:49,658 --> 00:38:50,658
I earned and came!

776
00:38:51,325 --> 00:38:51,950
Money...

777
00:38:52,283 --> 00:38:53,616
Even Sunny Leone makes money!

778
00:38:54,575 --> 00:38:56,241
It's not about how much we earn,

779
00:38:56,575 --> 00:38:57,950
it's about how we go
about earning money.

780
00:38:59,116 --> 00:39:00,491
Take it back, your clothes.

781
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,616
She is a star,

782
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,450
Like me, she has crores of fans.

783
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:05,366
Do you have any fans?

784
00:39:06,366 --> 00:39:08,825
Your own two bulls
don't listen to you!

785
00:39:10,075 --> 00:39:11,616
My own son doesn't listen to me

786
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,283
and will my bulls listen to me?

787
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:13,991
Bharatha!

788
00:39:14,366 --> 00:39:15,825
Why are you talking
back to your father,

789
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:17,658
Did he ask you to go and work?

790
00:39:18,325 --> 00:39:20,241
Why can't you just
eat and stay at home?

791
00:39:21,241 --> 00:39:22,741
If I am idle, you poke me,

792
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:25,158
if I earn and come
then also you poke me!

793
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:27,616
How are you managing with him?

794
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,575
If it was a girl
from today's times,

795
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,033
she would have divorced
him in just a day.

796
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,991
Did you hear him?

797
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:35,366
He's gone to the level of
getting his parents divorced.

798
00:39:35,575 --> 00:39:37,241
Please be quiet father.

799
00:39:38,325 --> 00:39:41,075
By the time you get a divorce in India,
you will have another kid by then.

800
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,575
That's why we say...

801
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,950
India is great,
Indians are great.

802
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,783
Family values exist
only in India.

803
00:39:45,991 --> 00:39:46,616
Be quiet.

804
00:39:47,866 --> 00:39:49,700
Family values exist
on foreign shores,

805
00:39:49,908 --> 00:39:52,866
Where father, mother, sisters,
sister-in-law, daughter-in-law

806
00:39:52,866 --> 00:39:53,991
All sit together
and have a drink.

807
00:39:54,116 --> 00:39:54,616
Did you know that?

808
00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:55,825
Dumb you are!

809
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:57,450
It all comes down to
drinking with you!

810
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:57,950
Rascal!

811
00:39:59,158 --> 00:40:00,741
You will never flourish
in this lifetime!

812
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:08,366
Hello,

813
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:10,658
On WhatsApp,
I've sent you my new number!

814
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:11,825
save it.

815
00:40:11,991 --> 00:40:13,700
Fine, fine...
I'll call you later.

816
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:14,366
It's love.

817
00:40:14,575 --> 00:40:14,950
What did you say?

818
00:40:15,116 --> 00:40:15,825
Please be quiet.

819
00:40:16,575 --> 00:40:18,200
Your father will
not get you married,

820
00:40:18,741 --> 00:40:19,825
Don't even bother ask him,

821
00:40:20,408 --> 00:40:21,450
He'll get you
married to His bull.

822
00:40:21,616 --> 00:40:22,908
We will get you married
too, my boy!

823
00:40:23,116 --> 00:40:24,491
We'll find a foreign
girl for you!

824
00:40:24,575 --> 00:40:24,950
What?

825
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,825
Foreign?

826
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:29,866
The girls in the neighborhood are not falling
for me, and you have gone to foreign shores?

827
00:40:42,991 --> 00:40:44,491
Case number 16/05

828
00:40:45,741 --> 00:40:47,158
I don't care how much it cost,

829
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,200
I need them.

830
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:16,408
Come here...

831
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,408
Look at this bugger,
where he is learning to swim!

832
00:41:20,616 --> 00:41:21,783
Not learning to swim,
he is committing suicide.

833
00:41:22,575 --> 00:41:23,366
Suicide man!

834
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,033
Pull him up!

835
00:41:24,366 --> 00:41:25,075
I don't know how to swim.

836
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,825
Pull him up!

837
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,241
Leave me alone!
I want to die, please leave me!

838
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:39,741
Leave me alone! I want to die!
Please leave!

839
00:41:39,825 --> 00:41:40,658
Come, you rascal!

840
00:41:40,658 --> 00:41:42,158
I don't want to live in this
world, Please leave me!

841
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:43,283
Please leave me!

842
00:41:43,366 --> 00:41:44,575
Even while dying,
this rascal speaks in English.

843
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:56,866
I feel like smashing you!

844
00:41:57,533 --> 00:41:58,825
What is this problem of yours
that drove you to kill yourself?

845
00:41:59,658 --> 00:42:00,575
That too in a drum.

846
00:42:01,783 --> 00:42:03,033
For his height that
is like a well man!

847
00:42:03,283 --> 00:42:04,616
My height is only my problem!

848
00:42:05,866 --> 00:42:07,283
Don't break your head
about your height.

849
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:09,075
I am in love with a girl.

850
00:42:09,241 --> 00:42:09,866
Love?

851
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:10,950
You?

852
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,575
Her folks are looking for
a suitable boy for her.

853
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:17,283
Instead of a boy for a girl,
will they look for a girl for another?

854
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:18,616
Is it one-sided?

855
00:42:18,741 --> 00:42:19,616
No, it's two way!

856
00:42:20,325 --> 00:42:21,741
Then what are you worried about.

857
00:42:21,866 --> 00:42:22,950
Elope with her.

858
00:42:23,158 --> 00:42:25,825
If I had that much guts,
why would I have tried to kill myself?

859
00:42:26,658 --> 00:42:27,158
What is it now?

860
00:42:27,533 --> 00:42:29,116
You want to get married to
her, isn't it?

861
00:42:29,491 --> 00:42:29,991
We'll get it done.

862
00:42:30,325 --> 00:42:30,908
Really?

863
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:34,741
Once it's out of Bharatha's
mouth, it's a done deal.

864
00:42:35,158 --> 00:42:36,700
I will stand there
and get you married.

865
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:37,658
Really?

866
00:42:38,825 --> 00:42:39,575
I will do it dude.

867
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,491
Really?

868
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:41,450
I will do it dude.

869
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:42,325
Really?

870
00:42:43,075 --> 00:42:44,991
The two of us have
done so many people in!

871
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:45,908
We'll do it, don't worry.

872
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:46,575
Fine!

873
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,417
Hello...

874
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,667
My girl has come.

875
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:58,292
The bus went!

876
00:42:58,833 --> 00:42:59,458
The bus is going, come on.

877
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:00,583
What a buildup you gave!

878
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:02,583
Hold on! Slowly! Slowly guys.

879
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:03,125
Hold on! Slowly! Slowly guys.

880
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,458
Slowly! Slowly guys.

881
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:13,208
Watch out,
see who got into the bus!

882
00:43:13,417 --> 00:43:15,417
You're all responsible
for your things!

883
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,875
Turn that side man!

884
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:20,875
I will give you a bed
sheet, cover yourself!

885
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,542
Agreed that when we used to go to
school, we used to ogle at you!

886
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:24,833
But now we are all grown up,

887
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,708
we used to ogle at you!

888
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:26,375
Don't worry!

889
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:26,625
Take it off!

890
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,500
Take it off!

891
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,208
All this seems to be the
doing of that conductor!

892
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:30,875
Shall I finish him off?

893
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,208
302, 304... No, no, no!

894
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:34,583
OK!

895
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:35,750
Come here man.

896
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:36,583
What is it? What is it?

897
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:37,375
What is it guys?

898
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:38,000
Come here!

899
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:39,083
Come here, Coming, coming!

900
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,083
Come here man! I'm coming!
I'm coming! I'm coming!

901
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:42,125
Bharatha, he'll come to us, wait!
Come!

902
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,417
Getting onto our bus,
you want to have a tussle with us?

903
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:45,125
What is it?

904
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,000
What's your problem?
What, what are you going to hit us?

905
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,500
Who do you think
you are talking to?

906
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:49,458
He looks like he will hit us!

907
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:51,125
He has put his
hand on the collar.

908
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,792
Do you know who's guys we are?

909
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:07,458
Which village do you
want to go to lady?

910
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:08,417
What about you?

911
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:09,917
Give me, give me change!

912
00:44:10,042 --> 00:44:11,792
Don't buy tickets,
just go on and sit quietly.

913
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:14,583
Show me your girl man!

914
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:17,625
The one who is
standing in the front,

915
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:18,250
That's her.

916
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:19,208
Is that her?

917
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:22,125
What, that dwarf?

918
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,125
That's not her!

919
00:44:23,542 --> 00:44:24,167
It's that girl!

920
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:34,833
Is she the girl?

921
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:47,083
Yesterday was ours...

922
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:49,833
Today is his,

923
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,792
Tomorrow will belong to whom,

924
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:56,958
No one can understand further!

925
00:44:57,167 --> 00:45:01,750
Girlfriend is a magic ball!

926
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:04,625
If you try to catch...

927
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:10,042
Your hand will burn!

928
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:15,208
Oh! Siddappa! I don't want!

929
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:18,667
I will make a Tik-Tok video, I will make a
Tik-Tok video, and now you have lost your life!

930
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:20,250
I too have liked it man!

931
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:22,083
It's 5 million now, get up!

932
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,292
To share this joy,
you are no longer here!

933
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:25,625
Siddappa!

934
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,333
Look at her,
how awesome she looks!

935
00:45:38,792 --> 00:45:42,167
Wash the hands and then touch
her, she is like that!

936
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:46,833
In all her splendor,
for us, she is standing!

937
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:50,708
All the guys, with just her eyes...
She is taunting!

938
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:54,875
How awesome she looks!

939
00:45:55,417 --> 00:45:59,083
Her skin is so pink!

940
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:03,625
Shining like anything!

941
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,958
Sparkling like anything!

942
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:11,250
On the very spot!

943
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,292
It happened!

944
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,208
It happened!

945
00:46:15,208 --> 00:46:17,708
I fell in love!

946
00:46:17,792 --> 00:46:19,583
I lost it!

947
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:21,958
I lost it!

948
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:23,625
I lost it!

949
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:26,250
I lost my heart,

950
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:56,667
God knows how her
mother would be!

951
00:46:57,208 --> 00:47:01,167
The father who sculptured
her, she looks so good!

952
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:05,250
Her friend is also
like a Cinderella!

953
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:08,625
Shall I also fall
in love with her!

954
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:12,917
How awesome she looks!

955
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:17,125
Her skin is so pink!

956
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:21,667
Shining like anything!

957
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:26,000
Sparkling like anything!

958
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:29,292
Who are you,

959
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:31,083
Beautiful girl?

960
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,458
If I get her!

961
00:47:33,708 --> 00:47:35,792
I will be on full duty!

962
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,875
If she says yes!

963
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:39,917
Wedding feast!

964
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,375
If she says no!

965
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:44,250
The feast of death!

966
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:30,417
My mind is falling towards her!

967
00:48:31,292 --> 00:48:34,583
Like a mad horse, it is running!

968
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:39,375
Daily I get her dreams only!

969
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,917
Without any conversations,
it is ending!

970
00:48:43,042 --> 00:48:46,875
How awesome she looks!

971
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:51,083
Her skin is so pink!

972
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:55,625
Shining like anything!

973
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,958
Sparkling like anything!

974
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:04,917
I am the son of Kaveri!

975
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:09,625
Getting charged, shall we unite?

976
00:49:09,958 --> 00:49:13,792
If you say yes,
we will go to the town!

977
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:17,708
If you say no, in the fields...

978
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,333
What has happened to you man!

979
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,167
Don't you know the difference
between a woman and a man?!

980
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:27,333
At least can't you
respect my moustache?

981
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,583
See, both of them have come following us!
Stop, stop man!

982
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:45,708
Let's scold them properly
and send them on their way!

983
00:49:46,292 --> 00:49:46,958
Shall I ask her?

984
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:49,500
Ask her man!

985
00:49:54,917 --> 00:49:56,458
Bharatha, be positive!

986
00:49:57,917 --> 00:49:58,375
You move aside!

987
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:01,083
I need to talk to
her for five minutes.

988
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:02,167
Why the hell should
I move aside!

989
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,625
Whatever it is you can
talk in front of me.

990
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,042
If you are not going,
then you have no shame!

991
00:50:05,042 --> 00:50:06,458
Why should I be ashamed.
Listen and die!

992
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:07,917
Anu,

993
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:09,375
Just look at my eyes...

994
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:11,375
We can clearly tell
that you are drunk!

995
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,875
I'll smash your
head with a stone...

996
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:13,750
Monkey!

997
00:50:14,167 --> 00:50:15,167
Won't even let me speak.

998
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:22,417
I love you.

999
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:27,917
I love you.

1000
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:30,583
What love,

1001
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:31,542
What the hell do you think?

1002
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:33,000
I've also been
watching you daily,

1003
00:50:33,292 --> 00:50:34,417
Following us everywhere,

1004
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:34,917
Grinning all the time.

1005
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,708
How dare you come to our
village and talk about love!

1006
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:38,000
The guts you have!

1007
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:40,583
I will love you too,

1008
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:41,250
Don't tell anyone.

1009
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,458
Just be quiet for five
minutes, okay?

1010
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:43,458
You loafer,

1011
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,125
Stupid guy!

1012
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:44,750
Did you see?

1013
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,333
He first claimed
that he loves you,

1014
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:47,708
And now he is
saying he loves me!

1015
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:48,792
This is so typical
of boys mentality!

1016
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,250
There is no such thing
as loyalty at all.

1017
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:53,000
In spite of having a lover, they'll
keep eyeing their lover's friends too.

1018
00:50:53,542 --> 00:50:55,250
She is not as good-looking as
you, That's why she's jealous.

1019
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:57,042
Are you upset that
I didn't hug you.

1020
00:50:57,292 --> 00:50:58,625
I love you, come let's hug!

1021
00:50:58,625 --> 00:50:59,333
Who the hell are you?

1022
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:01,625
What is it girls? What happened?

1023
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:05,583
Look brother, he's come to our village and
he is behind us to fall in love with him.

1024
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:06,708
Trash him properly!

1025
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:09,292
Which village are you from?

1026
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:10,750
Do you care for your life?

1027
00:51:11,417 --> 00:51:12,542
You become a hero later!

1028
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,375
First did you hear
what she just said?

1029
00:51:15,042 --> 00:51:16,000
She addressed you as brother.

1030
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,375
I am like a brother.

1031
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:19,167
To all the women folk in our
village, I am a brother!

1032
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:21,458
If you cast an eye on our woman
we will never spare anyone!

1033
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,000
Don't you push me.

1034
00:51:24,792 --> 00:51:26,750
You are showing of
thinking I have come alone?

1035
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,667
Do you know who is with me?

1036
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:32,708
Bharatha!

1037
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:35,875
Come here, where are you going?
Come here, come!

1038
00:51:36,042 --> 00:51:36,542
Brother,

1039
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:38,000
Brother,why should we
fight amongst ourselves.

1040
00:51:38,042 --> 00:51:39,000
Let's compromise!

1041
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,417
Now you are not the only
brother to these two,

1042
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:42,500
I am also their brother.

1043
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:43,000
See brother...

1044
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:43,708
I'm your brother!

1045
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:45,583
I'm your brother!
Don't you come to hug me,

1046
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:47,042
He has already hugged thrice.

1047
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,542
Did you hug thrice?

1048
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:52,958
Where, where is Bharatha?

1049
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:54,125
Hit him, hit him!

1050
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:55,542
Don't let him go guys!
Don't let him go guys!

1051
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,875
Climb, climb on dude!

1052
00:51:59,000 --> 00:51:59,792
Look at him, getting away.

1053
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:00,833
Shankara,
he's getting away, see!

1054
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:02,417
Not only her,

1055
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,500
I will fall in love
with your sister too!

1056
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,500
Do what you can!

1057
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:05,333
Go fast dude!

1058
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,167
Satisha,

1059
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:08,167
Near the village entrance,
two guys are coming on a Yamaha bike...

1060
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,375
Block them!

1061
00:52:22,792 --> 00:52:23,250
Baahubali,

1062
00:52:24,417 --> 00:52:25,042
Come, come!

1063
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,250
Let's get more guys
from our village!

1064
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,833
Come or they will hit us up!

1065
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:29,583
Don't go, come!

1066
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:30,292
Go, it's your funeral!

1067
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:31,042
Santhu,

1068
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,500
one of the guys escaped
and has boarded a bus!

1069
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,750
The bus is heading
towards the village,

1070
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,792
Don't spare him. Lock him!

1071
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:13,917
Stand the hell up!

1072
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,833
What,
you are sitting and dreaming?

1073
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:17,083
We've also been
observing since then,

1074
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,500
You have taken the spanner
and unscrewing something.

1075
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,417
Stand the hell up!

1076
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,250
What the hell were you
sitting down and unscrewing?

1077
00:56:27,875 --> 00:56:28,458
Stupid guy!

1078
00:56:34,292 --> 00:56:35,125
What is happening guys?

1079
00:56:35,167 --> 00:56:37,125
Brother, he eve-teased our village
girls and is trying to escape.

1080
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:38,667
So, does that mean you'll
fight amongst yourselves?

1081
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,458
Why do you have a
Panchayat in the village?

1082
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:42,250
Bring him there,
let's decide there.

1083
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:43,583
We don't want the Panchayat.

1084
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:45,125
Brother,
spoken in like a true man!

1085
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,375
Why is that even
a Panchayat then?

1086
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:46,750
Let's go!

1087
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:51,333
What is it?

1088
00:56:52,417 --> 00:56:53,958
It's a love case.

1089
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:56,875
Let them be then, chill guys!

1090
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:00,167
Do you even know
what you're saying?

1091
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,542
There is a boy and a girl

1092
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:03,625
Who have seen each other
and approve of each other,

1093
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:04,458
Then it's a done deal.

1094
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:06,583
Why are you guys
coming in between?

1095
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:08,125
Spoken like a true man!

1096
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:08,917
Isn't it so?

1097
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:10,333
Are we born to dogs?

1098
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:11,458
Isn't it so?

1099
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:13,583
We've put you in the
position of a leader,

1100
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:15,042
We must first take you down!

1101
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:16,833
How will we change our leader?

1102
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:18,958
There is some sense
in what he's saying.

1103
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:20,167
What sense are
you talking about?

1104
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:22,500
Supporting and talking in favor of
the neighboring village! Is it done?

1105
00:57:22,667 --> 00:57:24,125
Just because your
leader is horny,

1106
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,500
Do you think all the
rest are like him?

1107
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:26,917
You have asked
this correctly man!

1108
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:27,708
Who are you calling horny?

1109
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:28,792
Who are you telling this to?

1110
00:57:29,042 --> 00:57:30,208
Why are you acting big?

1111
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:32,292
Hit them guys!

1112
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:37,208
Don't spare them! Don't spare them!
Hit him! Hit him!

1113
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:40,125
See him! Don't spare him!

1114
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:41,250
See, who he is!

1115
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:46,250
Stop right there!

1116
00:57:47,375 --> 00:57:48,333
Wait, I'll do the talking.

1117
00:57:48,417 --> 00:57:49,333
You go! Ask her properly!

1118
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:49,667
You go!

1119
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:50,792
What now?

1120
00:57:51,042 --> 00:57:51,917
You don't speak!

1121
00:57:52,208 --> 00:57:52,958
It's all because of you!

1122
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:54,375
You lit the spark and the
fireworks started there!

1123
00:57:55,417 --> 00:57:57,917
Any guy trying to fall in love with
a girl will have a friend like you,

1124
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,583
To create trouble!

1125
00:57:59,667 --> 00:58:00,667
What I have done so
far, that is unusual?

1126
00:58:01,417 --> 00:58:03,083
I fell in love,
that is it, right?

1127
00:58:04,042 --> 00:58:04,458
No, no,

1128
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:05,292
he's fallen in love!

1129
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:06,083
Isn't that it?

1130
00:58:07,167 --> 00:58:07,917
What's wrong with that?

1131
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:10,333
If you want, say yes or say
no, it would have gotten over!

1132
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:12,000
We are roaming behind you
daily, right?

1133
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:13,208
You think your dad is
filling up the petrol?

1134
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:15,708
There is no need for any
Panchayat, okay?

1135
00:58:16,083 --> 00:58:18,208
Do you like him, do you love
him, tell right now, that's it!

1136
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:20,083
She should be capable of speaking,
to open her mouth and said it?

1137
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:21,458
What?

1138
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:22,417
She can't speak.

1139
00:58:29,917 --> 00:58:30,667
What is she trying to say?

1140
00:58:30,833 --> 00:58:32,875
She's not in love or
anything with anyone.

1141
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:34,583
She's not in love or
anything with anyone.

1142
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,500
If her dad gets to hear of this,

1143
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:38,042
He will pull her out of
college and get her married.

1144
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:41,208
Somehow she is at the dad's
brother's house and studying.

1145
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:43,000
Kindly let her be to herself!

1146
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,667
This was what she said.

1147
00:58:52,083 --> 00:58:52,667
Did she say okay?

1148
00:58:53,917 --> 00:58:55,542
Dude, she is not
interested in love and all,

1149
00:58:55,708 --> 00:58:56,542
Her father will not
agree, it seems!

1150
00:58:56,542 --> 00:58:57,292
Just let her be dude!

1151
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:58,333
Be quiet.

1152
00:58:58,750 --> 00:58:59,917
It is you I am in love with,

1153
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:00,750
Not your father!

1154
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:02,958
Just tell me you like me once!

1155
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,833
I will hit your
father and take you.

1156
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:06,708
She is dumb.

1157
00:59:07,667 --> 00:59:08,333
Why are you getting worked up?

1158
00:59:08,708 --> 00:59:09,167
Look,

1159
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,500
if you don't like me just open
your mouth and tell me directly.

1160
00:59:11,667 --> 00:59:14,542
Making these bomb noises
doesn't scare me at all!

1161
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:16,000
Dumb means...

1162
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:17,417
One who can't speak.

1163
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:19,167
She can't speak dude.

1164
00:59:21,042 --> 00:59:21,542
No dude.

1165
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:30,292
You don't break your head,

1166
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:32,708
If you like me, just tell me,

1167
00:59:32,917 --> 00:59:34,083
Even if you cannot speak.

1168
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:34,917
I will marry you.

1169
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:04,750
Silence now...

1170
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:07,333
What's the point in
remembering the past.

1171
01:00:09,292 --> 01:00:11,208
What am I lacking
man, am I not enough?

1172
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:13,625
She had to go fall in
love with that dwarf!

1173
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:21,000
I have updated her.

1174
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:22,375
She's ready to elope.

1175
01:00:22,708 --> 01:00:23,958
So she is ready to
elope, is she?

1176
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:25,417
Now, at this moment,

1177
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:27,667
if I tell her,
she is ready to run away!

1178
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,292
Do you have any doubt?

1179
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:30,583
No man, not at all.

1180
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,958
There are tears in your eyes!

1181
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:37,042
The thought of your love
story pierced my gut!

1182
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,083
That's why my eyes
are pumping water.

1183
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,708
So then tomorrow...

1184
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,208
Shall I get ready
for the wedding?

1185
01:00:42,542 --> 01:00:43,083
Fine, get ready!

1186
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,542
Let's see who is
going to oppose it,

1187
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:47,083
We will get you married!

1188
01:00:47,292 --> 01:00:48,917
Your eyes are also watering?

1189
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:51,000
It's because of the smoke, man!
get lost!

1190
01:00:51,208 --> 01:00:51,958
Due to smoke?

1191
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:57,125
Are your eyes burning?

1192
01:00:57,208 --> 01:00:57,583
Yes.

1193
01:00:59,167 --> 01:01:01,208
I know why you're crying?

1194
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,417
Why?

1195
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:08,833
You think I don't
know this much.

1196
01:01:09,292 --> 01:01:10,500
It's because I am crying

1197
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,792
That you are unable to hold your
sorrow and you are in tears!

1198
01:01:15,667 --> 01:01:16,458
Friendship...

1199
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:18,208
That's right man!

1200
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:22,375
This is why it is
called friendship.

1201
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:55,583
How many knots do I tie?

1202
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:57,500
You... You are 3 feet tall,
so tie it three times!

1203
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:06,833
You don't worry about anything,

1204
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:07,792
these guys are here for us.

1205
01:02:46,542 --> 01:02:48,292
After all that, you guys again
have attacked my base again!

1206
01:02:48,292 --> 01:02:49,875
You bastards!

1207
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:52,917
To avoid rouges like you
from eyeing my daughter,

1208
01:02:52,917 --> 01:02:54,167
I sent her to a different village to
study... You buggers went there and

1209
01:02:54,292 --> 01:02:56,708
Went to the level of
getting her married, right?

1210
01:02:58,667 --> 01:03:00,958
Let me see how you
will get out of jail!

1211
01:03:02,542 --> 01:03:04,042
Useless scoundrels!

1212
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:13,708
Yes, proceed!

1213
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:15,666
Yes, your honour!

1214
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:17,208
Your honour,

1215
01:03:17,541 --> 01:03:19,208
This is a wedding of minors,

1216
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:21,583
The wedding that is illegal,

1217
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,875
I request you to disqualify!

1218
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:27,250
Don't you have a
lawyer on your side?

1219
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:28,791
Your honour,

1220
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:32,041
Since we are
financially backward

1221
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,833
We don't have money
to pay the lawyer...

1222
01:03:34,166 --> 01:03:35,916
We don't have money
to pay the lawyer...

1223
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:36,750
That's why...

1224
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:39,750
Take a generous stance and can
you kindly argue on our behalf!

1225
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:42,833
Your honour,

1226
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:45,041
We will ourselves defend the
case independently, your honour.

1227
01:03:45,291 --> 01:03:45,833
Ok, tell me!

1228
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:47,125
Your honour,

1229
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:49,333
This is not a wedding of
minors, your honour!

1230
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:51,291
The girl has completed 18!

1231
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:54,291
Only after verifying her date of
birth, did we arrive at this decision!

1232
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:57,000
What she has done,
colluding with her dad,

1233
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,291
after changing her date of birth

1234
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:00,583
There is a possibility that she has
manipulated the witness, your honour!

1235
01:04:00,916 --> 01:04:02,833
You have to carefully
examine that

1236
01:04:03,041 --> 01:04:04,083
and give a good
judgment, your honour.

1237
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:10,916
I don't need to manipulate
the witness and win.

1238
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:12,416
As they say,

1239
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:13,750
My client is a major

1240
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:15,083
and has completed 18 years.

1241
01:04:15,875 --> 01:04:16,833
But the one who
hasn't crossed 18,

1242
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:18,250
Is their boy!

1243
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:23,916
All the relevant documents related to
that, I have submitted.

1244
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:25,875
What dude?

1245
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:27,291
The next month,

1246
01:04:27,625 --> 01:04:28,625
I will complete 20!

1247
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:31,125
20th is my birthday,
your honour.

1248
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:35,166
Oh God! Oh God!

1249
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:36,958
Sorry your honour,

1250
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:38,250
We weren't aware of this.

1251
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:39,583
Seeing his height,
we got cheated

1252
01:04:39,791 --> 01:04:40,791
We did not even bother
asking for the date,

1253
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:41,875
Please you have to...

1254
01:04:41,875 --> 01:04:42,875
With kindness,
with a generous outlook,

1255
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:44,083
You have to excuse
us, your honour!

1256
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:45,958
This time for the
State Festival...

1257
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:46,958
You are the chief guest!

1258
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:48,625
Giving you a silver club,

1259
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:49,875
We will honour
you with grandeur!

1260
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:52,458
Not only have you
committed a mistake,

1261
01:04:52,458 --> 01:04:54,250
To a judge,
you are you openly offering bribe?

1262
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:56,125
Do you know the consequence?
No, no, no...

1263
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:01,250
What a nutcase you are...

1264
01:05:01,625 --> 01:05:03,333
Saying that you will
honour her and the such,

1265
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:04,375
You have angered her

1266
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,791
What if she hangs us man!

1267
01:05:06,416 --> 01:05:07,166
What are you saying man?

1268
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:09,291
Yes bro, while you are
writing if the pen is broken,

1269
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:11,500
Our villagers
themselves say so...

1270
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:12,916
I'm not even related to this....
Please be quite...

1271
01:05:13,791 --> 01:05:15,333
While I was writing,
the pen broke, that's all!

1272
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:17,833
Give me another pen...

1273
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,291
Look at me and then
decide please...

1274
01:05:21,291 --> 01:05:22,833
Sister,
just spare only me sister...

1275
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:23,791
Just stand quietly man!

1276
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:26,375
With reference to this case,

1277
01:05:26,416 --> 01:05:30,416
as per IPC Section
365, 366, 496...

1278
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:34,416
The accused would be
imprisoned for seven years

1279
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:37,333
and a fine of Rupees
one lakh is imposed.

1280
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:39,666
Did they spare me?

1281
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:42,250
And the other accused

1282
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,333
according to the
Juvenile Justice Act

1283
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,458
Considering him to be
a juvenile offender

1284
01:05:46,666 --> 01:05:48,375
is handed over to
the remand home.

1285
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,750
Thank you, your Honour.

1286
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:52,250
Your Honour,

1287
01:05:52,458 --> 01:05:53,833
I have one last request,

1288
01:05:54,166 --> 01:05:55,000
As only

1289
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:56,375
I am diabetic...

1290
01:05:56,708 --> 01:05:57,791
I request for a separate cell,

1291
01:05:58,125 --> 01:05:59,166
Bisleri water,

1292
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:00,375
sugarless coffee

1293
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:02,625
and food to be allowed from home

1294
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,000
It's a request, your Honour.

1295
01:06:05,458 --> 01:06:06,458
Do whatever it takes,

1296
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:07,500
please get them out!

1297
01:06:08,083 --> 01:06:08,791
You don't worry,

1298
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,625
I will get them out.

1299
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:10,708
Thank you...

1300
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,250
People would be scared to a certain extent
henceforth after seeing us, isn't it?

1301
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,583
Good power!

1302
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:33,708
Oh my!

1303
01:06:34,625 --> 01:06:35,583
I myself got scared!

1304
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:37,583
Go guys..

1305
01:06:37,833 --> 01:06:39,333
At least from now on,
lead a decent life!

1306
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:40,666
He's acting too smart,

1307
01:06:40,666 --> 01:06:41,333
Shall I kill him?

1308
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:42,416
Come dude...

1309
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,500
Saying such things,
everything got stuck to us!

1310
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:44,958
Come...

1311
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,041
Are you married?

1312
01:06:47,208 --> 01:06:47,666
Why?

1313
01:06:47,666 --> 01:06:50,208
Then, you are the one sending us inside
and you are the one getting us out too,

1314
01:06:50,208 --> 01:06:51,916
What, did you have a
bet with your husband?

1315
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:52,791
Not for a bet

1316
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:53,958
but for bread and butter!

1317
01:06:54,166 --> 01:06:54,916
Just for bread?

1318
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:56,666
For my livelihood dude!

1319
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:58,916
Then, they were my clients

1320
01:06:58,916 --> 01:06:59,625
So...

1321
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:00,666
You guys went in.

1322
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:01,208
Now...

1323
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:02,333
You are my clients,

1324
01:07:02,416 --> 01:07:03,250
So you came out,

1325
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:03,833
Simple!

1326
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:07,583
They are the ones
who got you bail.

1327
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,875
Meet Mr. Peter and Miss. Shri.

1328
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:10,416
Hi!

1329
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:11,041
Hi!

1330
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:11,833
Hello!

1331
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:12,416
Hello!

1332
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:14,416
This time for the
State Festival...

1333
01:07:14,875 --> 01:07:15,666
You are the Chief Guest!

1334
01:07:16,791 --> 01:07:17,875
A silver club for him

1335
01:07:18,125 --> 01:07:19,000
and a sandalwood
garland for you...

1336
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:19,375
It is fixed!

1337
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:21,083
I haven't come here
to be honoured...

1338
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:23,833
I will tell you about
the purpose later.

1339
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:25,291
You go and take rest.

1340
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,375
All these days, inside,
that is what we did!

1341
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:29,833
Who's going to drop us home,

1342
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,541
Will you or will they?

1343
01:07:30,958 --> 01:07:31,583
Excuse me!

1344
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:33,541
I'm not in the habit
of dropping people...

1345
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:35,250
Am more into putting
people in there!

1346
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:36,500
We too...

1347
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:37,625
I am talking about drinks...

1348
01:07:58,916 --> 01:07:59,458
Bharatha!

1349
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:00,541
Brother!

1350
01:08:00,666 --> 01:08:01,458
How are you?

1351
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:02,541
Brother...

1352
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:03,666
When I was in jail...

1353
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:05,208
Not a single day did you come to see me...
Both mom and daughter!

1354
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:06,916
You are coming with
crocodile tears now!

1355
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:09,291
People who have committed
murder and are inside,

1356
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:10,625
Get Biryani from their family

1357
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:11,750
and look at you...

1358
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:13,500
Did you even get lemon
rice even on one day?

1359
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:14,541
And here she comes,

1360
01:08:14,625 --> 01:08:15,291
Calling out for her brother!

1361
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:15,583
Such women!

1362
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,958
The villagers said you
were in the prison,

1363
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:21,166
but I assumed they were talking due
to jealousy and did not believe them!

1364
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:23,500
You should believe it when
people talk about someone's doom!

1365
01:08:23,583 --> 01:08:24,541
That's free publicity

1366
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,208
but when we are successful,

1367
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:28,041
we ourselves have to put
it as a Facebook Status

1368
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:28,791
and get likes,

1369
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:30,041
paid publicity!

1370
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:31,375
Why did you need all of this?

1371
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:33,250
Getting someone's
daughter married?

1372
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:34,666
I just went to help...

1373
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,500
Who would have thought that
it will turn bad like this?

1374
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:38,458
To help... Is it?

1375
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:41,375
You have grown up
sister at home,

1376
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:42,666
you have to get her married,

1377
01:08:42,875 --> 01:08:44,416
you have to earn a few rupees...

1378
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:45,708
Without any such responsibility!

1379
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:46,708
Someone...

1380
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:49,166
To get someone's
daughter get married,

1381
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,125
you had gone to
help, it seems, help!

1382
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:52,208
To hell with your capabilities!

1383
01:08:52,416 --> 01:08:53,250
It is you who have
a child for fame

1384
01:08:53,541 --> 01:08:55,625
and another for good luck,

1385
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:57,583
why should I bear
your responsibilities?

1386
01:09:03,416 --> 01:09:04,833
What is this Mummy?
There are just two pieces!

1387
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:06,458
It's. it's like this...

1388
01:09:06,833 --> 01:09:08,416
I was watching 'Putta
Gowri' serial...

1389
01:09:08,583 --> 01:09:09,708
In that...

1390
01:09:10,166 --> 01:09:11,083
Putta Gowri

1391
01:09:11,583 --> 01:09:13,708
Was sitting on a
tree and shivering...

1392
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:14,708
Below a tiger...

1393
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:16,541
With an open mouth

1394
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:19,291
was waiting to eat her dear!

1395
01:09:19,666 --> 01:09:20,916
You are way more than the tiger!

1396
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:22,833
In this age, you have almost
swallowed one whole chicken!

1397
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:23,500
See what you have served me,

1398
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:24,208
Take it!

1399
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:28,000
Having returned from prison...

1400
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,250
Has he even a little
shame or respect?

1401
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:33,750
He is behaving as if he had
been to the Big Boss Show!

1402
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:21,583
Son-in-law!

1403
01:10:22,541 --> 01:10:23,416
I told you, remember?

1404
01:10:23,791 --> 01:10:24,625
He is the same Loafer!

1405
01:10:38,458 --> 01:10:39,041
Cool bro!

1406
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:39,750
Cool!

1407
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:42,166
I can understand your
feelings very well bro!

1408
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:43,708
Even I have been
through love failures

1409
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:44,250
But

1410
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:45,250
After she got married,

1411
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:47,625
till now, I haven't even faced
her house and slept till date!

1412
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:48,916
You shouldn't come here bro!

1413
01:10:49,083 --> 01:10:49,500
Bro!

1414
01:10:49,916 --> 01:10:51,375
Every day after getting
up, towards the field,

1415
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,375
We need to go by
this road bro...

1416
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:52,791
In spite of it,

1417
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,083
you shouldn't be
coming this side bro.

1418
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,541
In the eyes of our old lover,

1419
01:10:55,916 --> 01:10:58,166
we should always
remain a masterpiece!

1420
01:10:58,458 --> 01:10:59,541
If we act this way,

1421
01:10:59,666 --> 01:11:00,500
we will end up becoming
a piece of comedy!

1422
01:11:00,958 --> 01:11:01,333
Bro,

1423
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,833
Those who fall in love
after they get married,

1424
01:11:02,916 --> 01:11:03,666
which piece are they bro?

1425
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:04,916
Rest in peace!

1426
01:11:07,166 --> 01:11:07,916
Dear Son-in-law...

1427
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,041
Come on in,
what's there to talk with him?

1428
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:11,041
Yes, coming father-in-law.

1429
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:28,208
Hello!

1430
01:11:28,916 --> 01:11:29,291
Hello!

1431
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,333
Hi!

1432
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:37,000
Guys,

1433
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:37,958
this is the blue map.

1434
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:38,541
OK!

1435
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:40,416
But this is white?

1436
01:11:40,791 --> 01:11:41,375
Shut up dude!

1437
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:42,916
For 3kms inside,

1438
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:44,625
we have to go
through the tunnel!

1439
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:48,791
There we need to
get underground.

1440
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:50,208
If this is closed,

1441
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:51,666
you guys have to break it.

1442
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,291
After entering there,

1443
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,208
we can directly get
inside the temple!

1444
01:11:56,375 --> 01:11:56,791
Ok!

1445
01:11:58,125 --> 01:12:00,250
And here is the point
where the safe is.

1446
01:12:03,708 --> 01:12:07,541
Inside this safe are valuable
statues worth crores that we need!

1447
01:12:07,916 --> 01:12:08,291
And...

1448
01:12:08,583 --> 01:12:10,875
That is why we have got
you both out of prison!

1449
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:12,958
Because it is really
difficult to steal here

1450
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:14,000
without the help of local hands,

1451
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:15,333
is very difficult, I know!

1452
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:17,583
Both of you will receive
a share from this...

1453
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:18,291
Okay?

1454
01:12:18,916 --> 01:12:19,666
How much would you give?

1455
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:21,375
Say like...

1456
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:22,666
10 percent.

1457
01:12:23,791 --> 01:12:24,833
10 percent it seems!

1458
01:12:24,916 --> 01:12:25,500
Go away,

1459
01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:26,583
have some Ragi balls
and take a nap!

1460
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:27,958
Just 10 percent,
come, let's go dude.

1461
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:29,041
Stand there man!

1462
01:12:29,166 --> 01:12:29,583
Why man?

1463
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:30,250
Why man?

1464
01:12:30,916 --> 01:12:32,208
Just by gambling,
we can earn 10 percent!

1465
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:32,833
Come let's go.

1466
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,708
That's only if I allow you to go
out, right?

1467
01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:35,916
Peter,

1468
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:36,583
Finish them.

1469
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:38,791
Look, she is joking man!

1470
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:41,583
Are we food on the
plate to finish us?

1471
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:42,208
Hey Peter!

1472
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:47,000
Baahubali,

1473
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:51,416
Amarendra Babubali...

1474
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:57,541
Amarendra Babubali...

1475
01:13:03,541 --> 01:13:04,458
How is it possible?

1476
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:19,833
Dude, a bullet has
entered your chest man!

1477
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:26,291
Amarendra Baahubali!!!

1478
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:27,791
Now you get up,

1479
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:29,416
Now you get up,

1480
01:13:30,625 --> 01:13:31,500
What about you?

1481
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:33,000
Run, run!

1482
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:40,583
Finished!

1483
01:13:49,708 --> 01:13:50,416
Where are they?

1484
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:57,041
Listen carefully man!

1485
01:13:57,291 --> 01:13:59,208
if she has come all the way from
foreign, looking for us,

1486
01:13:59,375 --> 01:14:01,125
they need us badly,

1487
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:02,541
don't just play the fool there!

1488
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:04,333
Whatever the deal be there

1489
01:14:04,333 --> 01:14:04,958
let's accept it,

1490
01:14:05,416 --> 01:14:06,625
money is important for us!

1491
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:07,583
Did you get what I said?

1492
01:14:09,416 --> 01:14:10,583
They have already
come and are waiting.

1493
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:13,083
Come, come, come!

1494
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:14,208
Come on!

1495
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:18,916
Sorry ma'am,

1496
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,500
we got a little late!

1497
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,375
Hi! It's OK!

1498
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:28,291
Look at this guys,
this is a blue map.

1499
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:31,791
Baahubali,

1500
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:32,708
what happened?

1501
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:34,750
What happened man?

1502
01:14:34,875 --> 01:14:35,416
Dude,

1503
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:36,416
didn't I mention on the way here

1504
01:14:36,416 --> 01:14:37,708
that I had a dream last night?

1505
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:39,500
It's opening just like that,

1506
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:41,083
there it was a tunnel,
this is outside,

1507
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:41,666
that's the only difference.

1508
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:43,500
And he is putting his hand
behind to pull out the gun.

1509
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,458
He just scratched his butt man!

1510
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:45,916
Come,

1511
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:46,500
Come,

1512
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,416
Listen to my words...

1513
01:14:47,791 --> 01:14:48,333
What happened?

1514
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:50,083
You just explain
your purpose ma'am.

1515
01:14:52,416 --> 01:14:54,291
I get all of these in
my dreams every night.

1516
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:56,083
This one,

1517
01:14:56,416 --> 01:14:56,916
This one,

1518
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:09,625
Mom...

1519
01:15:23,125 --> 01:15:24,250
Dad!!!!

1520
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:33,500
Baby, what happened...

1521
01:15:33,708 --> 01:15:34,750
Why did you scream?

1522
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:37,083
Is it that same dream?

1523
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:40,041
I'm getting those
dreams again and again!

1524
01:16:25,041 --> 01:16:27,208
That's a memory
from her past life.

1525
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:38,458
You were born and brought up in
another country in your previous life.

1526
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:45,416
You must have died accidentally.

1527
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,750
You must be getting
your memory back.

1528
01:16:59,166 --> 01:17:00,541
In this universe,

1529
01:17:00,875 --> 01:17:03,375
the earth has a special place.

1530
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:05,750
To every form of life

1531
01:17:06,041 --> 01:17:07,375
born on this earth,

1532
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,625
birth and death are a certainty.

1533
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:10,750
As such,

1534
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,250
man too is born and
dies and is reborn.

1535
01:17:13,416 --> 01:17:18,125
This is all about my past
life in Russia's experience.

1536
01:17:18,541 --> 01:17:20,416
After I realized that I too
have a life in the past,

1537
01:17:20,791 --> 01:17:22,458
videos about past life,

1538
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:23,500
I started watching.

1539
01:17:23,875 --> 01:17:25,375
I read a lot of books as well.

1540
01:17:25,958 --> 01:17:27,208
All my dream related things

1541
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:29,291
were in India, in Karnataka,

1542
01:17:29,625 --> 01:17:30,208
I realized...

1543
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:31,958
So that's why,

1544
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:33,208
I learnt Kannada.

1545
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:34,375
Finally

1546
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:35,583
I found the statue

1547
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:36,666
at Shravanabelagola.

1548
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:39,041
Between this statue
and my dreams,

1549
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:40,666
there's definitely a connection.

1550
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:41,625
A well...

1551
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:42,333
water,

1552
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,166
all of these why are
they coming in my dream,

1553
01:17:44,333 --> 01:17:44,833
I don't know!

1554
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,583
I decided to find
out about all this!

1555
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:50,791
Did you finish?

1556
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,166
Peter please,

1557
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:54,333
Peter doesn't
believe in all this.

1558
01:17:54,666 --> 01:17:55,333
After that,

1559
01:17:55,541 --> 01:17:57,083
chasing my dreams

1560
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:58,375
I have come till here.

1561
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:00,041
I want to know how I died,

1562
01:18:00,583 --> 01:18:01,458
my past life,

1563
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:03,250
if my family members
are still alive.

1564
01:18:03,583 --> 01:18:04,666
To find out all this,

1565
01:18:04,916 --> 01:18:05,541
I have come here...

1566
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,750
After I heard about
how you went to prison,

1567
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:08,666
I realized...

1568
01:18:09,041 --> 01:18:10,958
That you have a helping nature.

1569
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:12,583
I need your support.

1570
01:18:13,083 --> 01:18:14,500
Please help me out guys.

1571
01:18:15,541 --> 01:18:16,791
Don't just help,

1572
01:18:17,291 --> 01:18:19,625
I will pay you
however much you want.

1573
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:23,125
But there's one condition,

1574
01:18:23,291 --> 01:18:24,708
until my past life is known,

1575
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:26,333
you guys must be with me.

1576
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:26,833
Okay?

1577
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:30,000
There's nothing a like a past life and
all, Some devil has possessed her!

1578
01:18:30,166 --> 01:18:31,875
Let's take her to our old mosque

1579
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:33,750
and make the Muslim hit her a
few times with peacock feathers

1580
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:34,958
The devil will be let her be!

1581
01:18:35,666 --> 01:18:36,333
Devil!

1582
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,000
What is that?

1583
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,125
Your Mama!

1584
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:40,333
Devil means Ghost, Ghost!!

1585
01:18:40,541 --> 01:18:41,125
Ghost!!

1586
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:41,583
Yaa.

1587
01:18:41,791 --> 01:18:42,166
Where?

1588
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:43,000
Inside her!

1589
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,000
Ghost inside her?

1590
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:44,625
Yaa.

1591
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:47,583
Man, you are so funny.

1592
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:49,958
Will you please stop making fun of me?
Come dude!

1593
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,250
I know you don't
believe in such stuff.

1594
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:53,500
What man?

1595
01:18:53,708 --> 01:18:55,166
Why can't you just
shut up and work?

1596
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,791
and taking her to the Muslim!

1597
01:18:57,916 --> 01:18:59,250
That Muslim will make money,

1598
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,000
what do we get?

1599
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:01,500
That's what you say?

1600
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,083
Come then.

1601
01:19:03,958 --> 01:19:04,666
Look Shri.

1602
01:19:04,916 --> 01:19:06,333
Shri ma'am.

1603
01:19:06,791 --> 01:19:08,000
It's OK, you can call me Shri.

1604
01:19:08,166 --> 01:19:09,291
Where are you
staying by the way?

1605
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:10,416
Lodge.

1606
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:11,250
Lodge is it?

1607
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:12,458
The lodge in our village?

1608
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:15,708
Don't know how you guys are
sleeping in that cheap lodge!

1609
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:17,291
Bring your bags and clothes,

1610
01:19:17,583 --> 01:19:18,916
you can stay back at our
village Machine House.

1611
01:19:19,166 --> 01:19:20,291
Machine House, is it?

1612
01:19:20,458 --> 01:19:21,208
Yes.

1613
01:19:25,666 --> 01:19:26,333
See this house.

1614
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:28,125
This is called a Machine House.

1615
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:29,041
Okay.

1616
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:30,625
Do you like it?

1617
01:19:31,416 --> 01:19:32,375
Where's the rest room?

1618
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:33,041
Look,

1619
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:34,458
go inside the field

1620
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:35,958
and that side is water.

1621
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:37,541
You go there and wash there.

1622
01:19:38,333 --> 01:19:39,208
Hold it dude!

1623
01:19:39,416 --> 01:19:42,500
Hold it dude! aUsing foreign products and
fertilizers, our crops are already destroyed!

1624
01:19:42,833 --> 01:19:44,500
If he puts foreign
fertilizer directly,

1625
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,708
all the crops will surely
burn, that's all!

1626
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:46,875
Peter,

1627
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:48,750
In that Machine House,

1628
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:49,833
in the back,

1629
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:51,833
there is a small rest room.

1630
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:54,583
Go use it and
sleep in that room!

1631
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:56,291
This house is already so small.

1632
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:57,416
It's okay Peter

1633
01:19:57,583 --> 01:19:59,083
Indian villages are like that.

1634
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:00,208
We need to adjust.

1635
01:20:00,458 --> 01:20:01,625
I kind of like this place,

1636
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:02,416
it's okay.

1637
01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:03,166
Okay, okay!

1638
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:03,833
Ma'am,

1639
01:20:04,875 --> 01:20:05,333
Ma'am,

1640
01:20:06,416 --> 01:20:07,875
From when can I join the duty?

1641
01:20:08,166 --> 01:20:08,833
Which duty?

1642
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:09,208
About...

1643
01:20:09,333 --> 01:20:09,916
Searching for your back!

1644
01:20:10,125 --> 01:20:10,541
What?

1645
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:11,166
About...

1646
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:12,458
Your background, your past!

1647
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:13,916
Tomorrow.

1648
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:15,750
Come this way man!

1649
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,125
Shri...

1650
01:20:17,458 --> 01:20:19,625
Here,
there will be noises at night,

1651
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:20,583
don't be scared.

1652
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,125
Animals will be walking.

1653
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:23,166
Really?

1654
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:24,916
What kind of animals?

1655
01:20:26,708 --> 01:20:27,500
You mean Tiger?

1656
01:20:27,875 --> 01:20:28,791
No, Bandicoot.

1657
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:30,291
A big mouse!

1658
01:20:31,541 --> 01:20:32,708
I will fry it and eat it!

1659
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:35,833
Eat it and die!

1660
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:37,666
What?

1661
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:38,791
I don't know what he said.

1662
01:20:39,666 --> 01:20:40,625
Please call me anytime.

1663
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:41,375
Okay.

1664
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:42,083
Take rest.

1665
01:20:42,291 --> 01:20:42,625
Bye.

1666
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:43,458
See you tomorrow.

1667
01:20:43,458 --> 01:20:43,791
Bye.

1668
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:00,500
I don't know what is this?

1669
01:21:00,708 --> 01:21:01,416
who is this?

1670
01:21:01,625 --> 01:21:03,125
But all these came
in my dreams today.

1671
01:21:04,166 --> 01:21:06,166
All these dreams are from
really your past life...

1672
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:06,916
What is the guarantee for that?

1673
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:09,708
Drawing a God's picture

1674
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:12,083
and saying tell that is from my past
life, find this...

1675
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:13,333
Where can we get
that God for you?

1676
01:21:13,625 --> 01:21:14,000
Guys,

1677
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:15,250
you have to believe me.

1678
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:16,791
I know these dreams

1679
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:18,375
have some connection
with my past.

1680
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:20,583
Am I not paying
you for this job?

1681
01:21:20,958 --> 01:21:22,125
You guys have to do it.

1682
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:25,125
Jacked

1683
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:27,416
Our life is jacked!

1684
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:32,166
A dog's life!

1685
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:34,500
Ours is a dog's life!

1686
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:37,458
What's is all this
with you Bharatha?

1687
01:21:38,041 --> 01:21:38,708
What is it man?

1688
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,750
You don't even have
teeth, you dumbass!

1689
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:41,958
First go get your teeth fixed!

1690
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:44,833
Spiderman,

1691
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:46,416
whose nose is this?

1692
01:21:49,041 --> 01:21:49,791
Rajkumar!

1693
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:51,166
Rajkumar, is it?

1694
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,375
Check it carefully...

1695
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Rajkumar!

1696
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,250
You dumb head!

1697
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:01,083
In the era of the internet

1698
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,875
Searching for your
past life's relations,

1699

You have come all
the way here girl!

1700

You stupid girl!

1701
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:13,250
Instead of being in England...
Like chasing ants in India,

1702
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:18,458
Instead of being in England...
Is that so?

Like chasing ants in
India, Where are you dude?

He's looking for your
parents every where...

01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:33,625
Is it?

1711
01:22:33,625 --> 01:22:34,166
He's working very hard,

1712
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:35,916
day and night,
he's working very hard.

1713
01:22:35,916 --> 01:22:36,458
Yeah, yeah!

1714
01:22:37,125 --> 01:22:37,500
Bharatha,

1715
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:38,416
What is this?

1716
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:42,416
This is modern scary doll!

1717
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:43,958

01:23:06,833 --> 01:23:07,166
Five year baby...

No! Stop it, stop it please!

1732
01:23:19,083 --> 01:23:21,250
What kind of a boyfriend is he..

1733
01:23:25,791 --> 01:23:29,250
Neither is he going steady with
her, nor has he married her!

1734
01:23:29,541 --> 01:23:32,666
Neither is he going steady with
her, nor has he married her!

1735
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:39,250
Simply you have tagged
him along with you girl...

01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:40,583
You stupid girl!

1737
01:23:44,416 --> 01:23:44,666

1739
01:23:47,666 --> 01:23:48,958
Please be quiet!

1740
01:23:49,916 --> 01:23:51,041
No more questions.

1741
01:23:56,833 --> 01:23:57,166
Hello!

1742
01:23:57,916 --> 01:23:59,666
Shri...
I'm searching, I'm searching.

1743
01:24:00,041 --> 01:24:00,458
Come now,

1744
01:24:00,458 --> 01:24:01,708
I saw the eyes in my dreams,

1745
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:02,958
I'm drawing it.

1746
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:04,125
Where there is a draw,

1747
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:05,416
there itself is the reward!

1748
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:07,833
Are you both drunk?

1749
01:24:08,458 --> 01:24:11,375
We drink with our dad's money,
Who are you to question?

1750
01:24:11,375 --> 01:24:12,291
God, you idiots,

1751
01:24:12,458 --> 01:24:13,166
I'm Shri here,

1752
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:13,791
hurry up and come!

1753
01:24:13,791 --> 01:24:15,250
I'm drawing the eyes now.

1754
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:17,166
Your eyes,

1755
01:24:17,166 --> 01:24:19,458
bury them in salt
and cut the call!

1756
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:21,333
Come tomorrow,
I'm going to fire you both.

1757
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:22,625
You and your past life!

1758
01:24:30,291 --> 01:24:30,791
Oh! God,

1759
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:33,708
What happened Shri?

1760
01:24:33,791 --> 01:24:34,458
Why are you so upset?

1761
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:36,416
I have been trying their phones

1762
01:24:36,416 --> 01:24:38,041
and both their numbers
are switched off.

1763
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:39,000
Obviously,

1764
01:24:39,291 --> 01:24:40,375
These guys are frauds.

1765
01:24:41,666 --> 01:24:42,583
The milk and rice talk...

1766
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:43,458
The milk and rice talk...

1767
01:24:43,458 --> 01:24:45,666
On my tongue,
Lord Shiva resides in it!

1768
01:24:46,041 --> 01:24:46,916
The milk and rice talk...

1769
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:48,208
Come out mother Shri...

1770
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:49,083
The fortune teller is here

1771
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:51,291

He will say it quickly!

1772
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:53,625
If it's true, accept it as
true, don't try to blabber...

1773
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:55,083
With this fortune teller Rama

1774
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:57,791
Mother, what is running on your
mind It's about your past life!

1775
01:24:57,791 --> 01:24:58,875
Drowned in water, What?

1776
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:00,791
Leave everything behind
mother, It was just a bad time!

1777
01:25:01,416 --> 01:25:01,958
Who is that guy?

1778
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:03,208
What is he shaking?

1779
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:03,708
I don't know.

1780
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:04,791
Are you foreigners?

1781
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:07,291
Ma'am Shri,

1782
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:08,583

Will happen in future!

1784
01:25:10,041 --> 01:25:11,375

01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:15,416
Bullshit!

1788
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:18,416
Lady, you died in the water!
and that's the matter.

1789
01:25:18,666 --> 01:25:19,875
Oh! My God, is it true?

1790
01:25:20,541 --> 01:25:23,208

Good news is going

1792

Very, very soon.

1793
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:26,666
Oh! My God,

1794
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:27,458
what is it?

1795
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,125

01:25:33,166 --> 01:25:34,083
Where were you both?

1798
01:25:34,166 --> 01:25:35,375
Since yesterday,
your phones are switched off.

1799
01:25:35,916 --> 01:25:36,791
We went for your work only,

1800
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:37,583
there's good news.

1801
01:25:37,875 --> 01:25:39,916
This guy just told me,
that he had good news for me.

1802
01:25:40,166 --> 01:25:40,958
We have a surprise for you!

1803
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:41,750
Surprise?

1804
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:42,291
What's that?

1805
01:25:42,666 --> 01:25:42,958
Come with us...

1806
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:44,458
Come that side,
I will show you...

1807
01:25:46,291 --> 01:25:46,666
I mean... I will tell you!

1808
01:25:56,541 --> 01:25:56,916
Come.

1809
01:25:57,583 --> 01:25:58,000
Please come.

1810
01:25:59,041 --> 01:25:59,458
Mother...

1811
01:26:00,666 --> 01:26:01,875
See who is here.

1812
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:03,583
Brother...
Brother, are you fine?

1813
01:26:08,375 --> 01:26:09,041
Brother, are you fine?

1814
01:26:09,583 --> 01:26:11,208
Are you taking
medicines on time?

1815
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:13,875
Look who's here?

1816
01:26:15,416 --> 01:26:16,333
Our Geetha!

1817
01:26:38,208 --> 01:26:38,583
Shri,

1818
01:26:38,875 --> 01:26:39,583
guess who this is, let's see?

1819
01:26:41,791 --> 01:26:42,500
I don't know.

1820
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:45,250
Look at the photo on the wall.

1821
01:26:48,583 --> 01:26:49,416
Guess who that is?

1822
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:52,208
Who's that?

1823
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:53,208
Mother,

1824
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:54,791
who's in that photo,

1825
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:55,541
you only tell her!

1826
01:26:56,666 --> 01:26:57,166
Come dear...

1827
01:27:01,833 --> 01:27:02,916
The girl in this photo,

1828
01:27:03,666 --> 01:27:04,666
is my daughter Geetha.

1829
01:27:05,958 --> 01:27:08,083
When she was two years old,
this picture was clicked.

1830
01:27:09,416 --> 01:27:10,666
When she left us,

1831
01:27:11,458 --> 01:27:12,458
She was six!

1832
01:27:13,666 --> 01:27:15,958
She was lost in
the Baahubali fair!

1833
01:27:38,083 --> 01:27:40,125
There's no place that we
have not searched for her!

1834
01:27:41,916 --> 01:27:43,666
Even though we
searched everywhere,

1835
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:48,375
we did not find her!

1836
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:51,875
Finally she was found in a
well, as a dead body!

1837
01:27:54,875 --> 01:27:55,958
Her innocent face,

1838
01:27:56,541 --> 01:27:57,583
her smiling face,

1839
01:27:58,666 --> 01:28:00,375
I am unable to forget even now!

1840
01:28:05,166 --> 01:28:07,000
Suffering in her memories

1841
01:28:07,958 --> 01:28:10,250
my husband had a stroke
and is bedridden!

1842
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:18,000
He was the only earning
member of the family.

1843
01:28:18,833 --> 01:28:20,333
Selling everything we had,

1844
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:23,000
we are somehow living!

1845
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,041
Your daughter is reborn

1846
01:28:25,458 --> 01:28:27,208
and is searching for us!

1847
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:29,583
After we came to know this
I am unable to believe this!

1848
01:28:30,625 --> 01:28:31,916
The priest used to tell us...

1849
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:33,416
'Don't grieve,

1850
01:28:33,791 --> 01:28:35,750
'Don't grieve, your daughter
will be reborn and return to you!

1851
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:36,875
Geetha...

1852
01:28:37,541 --> 01:28:38,291
After looking at you,

1853
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:41,000
My inner voice is saying...

1854
01:28:42,208 --> 01:28:42,833
My daughter

1855
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:46,291
My daughter is
reborn for my sake!

1856
01:28:48,958 --> 01:28:49,625
Geetha!

1857
01:28:50,416 --> 01:28:51,291
I can feel it,

1858
01:28:51,416 --> 01:28:52,583
You are my mother.

1859
01:29:04,583 --> 01:29:04,958
Dear,

1860
01:29:06,083 --> 01:29:07,125
She is our daughter Geetha,

1861
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:09,291
She has been reborn to meet us,

1862
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,458
She's our little one dear.

1863
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:14,791
Dad. ..

1864
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:17,766
Wearing green shorts,

1865
01:30:18,683 --> 01:30:21,058
With pockets filled
with marbles...

1866
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:24,808
You used to play
in the mud girl....

1867
01:30:25,058 --> 01:30:28,475
Now how tall you have grown!

1868
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:32,391
Keeping an ice
cream in your mouth!

1869
01:30:32,641 --> 01:30:35,558
Holding money in your hand!

1870
01:30:35,975 --> 01:30:39,308
You used to swing
on the trees...

1871
01:30:39,308 --> 01:30:42,808
Now you have grown like a tree!

1872
01:30:56,683 --> 01:30:59,850
Your endearing words

1873
01:31:00,266 --> 01:31:03,516
Listening to them,
I spent my time...

1874
01:31:03,766 --> 01:31:06,808
These sweet kisses of yours,

1875
01:31:07,141 --> 01:31:10,391
On getting them,
I pushed my days...

1876
01:31:10,641 --> 01:31:14,225
Daily, in your loving embrace...

1877
01:31:17,558 --> 01:31:20,850
Daily, in your loving embrace...

1878
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:24,100
I melted in them...

1879
01:31:24,516 --> 01:31:27,683
I drowned in them!

1880
01:31:28,016 --> 01:31:31,141
I melted in them...

1881
01:31:31,391 --> 01:31:34,558
I drowned in them!

1882
01:31:39,641 --> 01:31:42,058
As soon as possible,
I will take you and dad abroad,

1883
01:31:42,183 --> 01:31:43,683
Henceforth your must be with me.

1884
01:31:43,933 --> 01:31:44,433
Shri,

1885
01:31:44,891 --> 01:31:45,641
What are you saying?

1886
01:31:46,058 --> 01:31:47,308
Already your dad has a stroke,

1887
01:31:47,475 --> 01:31:48,683
Your mom is a crack!

1888
01:31:49,433 --> 01:31:50,016
Crack?

1889
01:31:51,058 --> 01:31:51,808
After you were lost,

1890
01:31:51,850 --> 01:31:53,058
She had a mental breakdown.

1891
01:31:53,933 --> 01:31:55,391
Now little by little,
she's recovering.

1892
01:31:55,683 --> 01:31:56,641
Taking a stroll in the village,

1893
01:31:56,808 --> 01:31:58,641
and at night,
sleeping amidst nature

1894
01:31:58,766 --> 01:32:00,141
is what will help,
as per the doctor,

1895
01:32:00,141 --> 01:32:00,600
isn't it?

1896
01:32:00,725 --> 01:32:01,516
Yes!

1897
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:02,641
But if I leave her here,

1898
01:32:02,641 --> 01:32:03,850
who will take care of her?

1899
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:05,475
For that only, aren't we here?

1900
01:32:05,808 --> 01:32:06,683
Do you need someone
better than us?

1901
01:32:07,433 --> 01:32:09,100
About our helping
nature, don't you know?

1902
01:32:09,433 --> 01:32:11,933
The foreign land will be like
a golden prison for them,

1903
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:12,766
Isn't it so, sister?

1904
01:32:15,641 --> 01:32:17,850
In our village,
many parents live like this Shri.

1905
01:32:18,141 --> 01:32:19,600
Their kids are all
settled abroad.

1906
01:32:19,975 --> 01:32:21,850
Once in every three years
or five years they do come.

1907
01:32:22,016 --> 01:32:23,766
Either New Years of The Festival
of Lights they celebrate,

1908
01:32:23,891 --> 01:32:24,975
take a Selfie and return.

1909
01:32:25,266 --> 01:32:25,683
But without fail,

1910
01:32:25,933 --> 01:32:27,808
without fail,
they transfer money into their account!

1911
01:32:28,933 --> 01:32:29,558
Isn't it so sister?

1912
01:32:30,891 --> 01:32:31,683
Yes dear daughter,

1913
01:32:32,308 --> 01:32:33,891
We don't need
foreign and the such.

1914
01:32:34,808 --> 01:32:35,683
We found you,

1915
01:32:35,808 --> 01:32:36,516
that's more than enough.

1916
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:38,558
Be careful!

1917
01:32:39,475 --> 01:32:41,141
As soon as you uttered that
See how happy your father is!

1918
01:32:41,433 --> 01:32:43,225
Due to this happiness, he may recover
his ability in both his arm and mouth.

1919
01:32:43,683 --> 01:32:45,391
Your daughter won't go
anywhere, just sleep, sleep!

1920
01:32:45,558 --> 01:32:47,100
Why are you lifting
yourself up aggressively?

1921
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:47,891
Is it due to happiness?

1922
01:32:48,308 --> 01:32:48,766
Then?

1923
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:50,725
Don't worry mom,

1924
01:32:51,141 --> 01:32:52,016
I will go abroad,

1925
01:32:52,141 --> 01:32:53,183
consult the doctors,

1926
01:32:53,475 --> 01:32:54,808
and will arrange for
the best treatment,

1927
01:32:55,391 --> 01:32:56,100
I'm with you.

1928
01:32:56,725 --> 01:32:57,850
A daughter fit for her mother!

1929
01:33:13,308 --> 01:33:13,850
Hi dad!

1930
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:14,683
Hi Shri!

1931
01:33:14,808 --> 01:33:17,600
Dad, I found out about my
parents from my past life.

1932
01:33:19,391 --> 01:33:20,683
What are you talking about Shri?

1933
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:21,516
Yes dad,

1934
01:33:21,641 --> 01:33:23,100
I know everything right now,

1935
01:33:23,516 --> 01:33:25,058
I even know how I died.

1936
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:27,808
What to do?

1937
01:33:27,891 --> 01:33:28,350
Dad!!!

1938
01:33:29,266 --> 01:33:29,891
Are you there?

1939
01:33:31,308 --> 01:33:32,016
Dad!!!

1940
01:33:32,683 --> 01:33:34,350
The role only is mine,

1941
01:33:34,725 --> 01:33:36,475
the direction was all yours!

1942
01:33:36,975 --> 01:33:38,225
The milk and rice talk...
The milk and rice talk...

1943
01:33:38,475 --> 01:33:39,725
The milk and rice talk...
The milk and rice talk...

1944
01:33:39,808 --> 01:33:40,850
You can speak later,

1945
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:42,475
finish your drink quickly,
shut up and leave!

1946
01:33:50,808 --> 01:33:51,183
Tony!

1947
01:33:52,558 --> 01:33:53,100
Come here!

1948
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:53,808
Brother.

1949
01:33:56,475 --> 01:33:56,891
Brother.

1950
01:33:59,641 --> 01:34:00,891
I asked you what
the problem was,

1951
01:34:00,891 --> 01:34:01,975
did we ask you to drink?

1952
01:34:02,308 --> 01:34:02,725
Brother,

1953
01:34:02,850 --> 01:34:05,225
They have made me take on
both the roles brother.

1954
01:34:05,641 --> 01:34:06,808
I'm both the cameraman

1955
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:08,516
and the reporter too brother!

1956
01:34:08,725 --> 01:34:10,391
My mother isn't well, bro!

1957
01:34:10,766 --> 01:34:13,350
I will go to the village and return,
give me a day's off, when I asked thus...

1958
01:34:13,516 --> 01:34:14,600
These guys said,

1959
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,975
give news that will suffice
for a day and then go, brother.

1960
01:34:17,391 --> 01:34:18,933
From where shall I
bring the news bro?

1961
01:34:18,975 --> 01:34:20,183
Oh, please don't cry,
don't cry, don't cry dude!

1962
01:34:20,350 --> 01:34:21,683
Give me news!

1963
01:34:21,808 --> 01:34:22,641
Tell me,

1964
01:34:22,850 --> 01:34:24,016
give me one news guys!

1965
01:34:24,225 --> 01:34:25,725
These newsmakers have

1966
01:34:25,891 --> 01:34:27,225
many stories within them dude...

1967
01:34:27,683 --> 01:34:29,683
Poor guys,
they are only saying other's stories

1968
01:34:29,766 --> 01:34:31,100
that no one listen
to their story!

1969
01:34:45,225 --> 01:34:46,558
Hi Dad, Good morning!

1970
01:34:46,558 --> 01:34:46,975
Hi!

1971
01:34:50,933 --> 01:34:51,350
Dear...

1972
01:34:52,225 --> 01:34:52,600
Dear,

1973
01:34:52,808 --> 01:34:54,141
your hand has been cured dear!

1974
01:34:54,225 --> 01:34:54,683
Yes, yes!

1975
01:34:54,683 --> 01:34:55,058
Shri,

1976
01:34:55,391 --> 01:34:56,516
how magical!

1977
01:34:56,766 --> 01:34:59,016
Your dad's hand and his
mouth too have been cured.

1978
01:34:59,266 --> 01:35:00,641
Can you guys please stop it!

1979
01:35:03,975 --> 01:35:06,975
I have never seen such
tremendous actors in my life!

1980
01:35:09,266 --> 01:35:10,225
Don't act smart!

1981
01:35:10,808 --> 01:35:13,058
I will make your hand like
this for the rest of your life.

1982
01:35:13,183 --> 01:35:14,058
Thrash him,
thrash him a few times.

1983
01:35:14,058 --> 01:35:15,308
Why did you behave like this?

1984
01:35:16,058 --> 01:35:17,641
I trusted you so much.

1985
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:19,266
We told them that
we would not do so,

1986
01:35:19,433 --> 01:35:20,975
but those Bharatha and Baahubali

1987
01:35:20,975 --> 01:35:22,266
convinced us by showing money!

1988
01:35:22,516 --> 01:35:24,141
Every month money will come in

1989
01:35:24,183 --> 01:35:25,558
is what they said
and convinced us.

1990
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,558
We thought you will
not realize so soon,

1991
01:35:29,308 --> 01:35:30,516
how did you find out?

1992
01:35:32,766 --> 01:35:34,475
You cannot cheat
everyone, all the time!

1993
01:35:35,016 --> 01:35:35,350
Peter,

1994
01:35:35,475 --> 01:35:36,058
let's go.

1995
01:35:39,183 --> 01:35:39,891
Good acting,

1996
01:35:40,058 --> 01:35:40,600
keep it up!

1997
01:35:42,225 --> 01:35:43,016
Crazy guys!

1998
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:45,183
You stupid guy!

1999
01:35:45,558 --> 01:35:46,058
Frauds!

2000
01:35:47,183 --> 01:35:48,350
Frauds are not born,

2001
01:35:48,516 --> 01:35:49,183
they are made!

2002
01:35:49,475 --> 01:35:51,725
After hearing your stupid past life
story, did we get this idea!

2003
01:35:51,933 --> 01:35:53,058
I don't need your explanation.

2004
01:35:53,225 --> 01:35:53,891
Now get lost!

2005
01:35:54,016 --> 01:35:54,558
Where should we go?

2006
01:35:54,683 --> 01:35:55,266
the pump house is ours,

2007
01:35:55,308 --> 01:35:56,308
pay the rent and you go!

2008
01:35:56,516 --> 01:35:57,100
What's the rent?

2009
01:35:57,225 --> 01:35:58,016
It's 10,000 per day what?

2010
01:35:58,350 --> 01:35:58,683
What?

2011
01:35:59,225 --> 01:35:59,850
10,000?

2012
01:36:00,725 --> 01:36:02,350
Why are you giving
rent to these frauds?

2013
01:36:03,683 --> 01:36:04,808
They have been to jail

2014
01:36:05,225 --> 01:36:07,641
and India needs more
jails for guys like this.

2015
01:36:08,266 --> 01:36:09,475
All Indians are frauds!

2016
01:36:10,433 --> 01:36:11,850
Don't you talk about our India!

2017
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:13,850
Peter, do not speak
about India like that!

2018
01:36:14,058 --> 01:36:15,558
Why are you supporting Indians?

2019
01:36:17,433 --> 01:36:18,058
I'm an Indian!

2020
01:36:26,933 --> 01:36:27,308
You...

2021
01:36:27,475 --> 01:36:28,183
You are an Indian?

2022
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:30,558
Dad,

2023
01:36:30,766 --> 01:36:31,308
dad?

2024
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,100
Are you there?

2025
01:36:33,391 --> 01:36:33,975
Shri,

2026
01:36:35,141 --> 01:36:36,725
they are not your parents,

2027
01:36:38,266 --> 01:36:39,433
someone is fooling you.

2028
01:36:39,683 --> 01:36:40,933
Dad, are you serious?

2029
01:36:41,433 --> 01:36:42,850
Did you actually lie to me?

2030
01:36:44,016 --> 01:36:45,516
Didn't our astrologer
agree to it?

2031
01:36:45,725 --> 01:36:46,433
Sorry dear!

2032
01:36:46,808 --> 01:36:49,516
It was we who made the
astrologer lie to you...

2033
01:36:49,683 --> 01:36:52,266
The truth is that you
are not our daughter!

2034
01:36:52,308 --> 01:36:53,891
Mom, what are you talking about?

2035
01:36:54,933 --> 01:36:56,308
Who am I if I'm
not your daughter?

2036
01:36:56,558 --> 01:36:57,808
You are from India...

2037
01:37:00,891 --> 01:37:04,933
We found you in a well!
While we were travelling in India

2038
01:37:04,933 --> 01:37:06,433
We saw that incident!

2039
01:37:08,183 --> 01:37:10,266
Someone was trying to kill you!

2040
01:37:20,516 --> 01:37:23,225
It may have been
your father itself...

2041
01:37:23,225 --> 01:37:26,516
Because, then in India,
female infanticide were in vogue...

2042
01:37:26,933 --> 01:37:29,808
We protected you,
and got you with us!

2043
01:37:31,058 --> 01:37:34,183
As you had a huge wound on your
head you lost your memory power!

2044
01:37:34,516 --> 01:37:36,475
That is why we had kept
that incident a secret!

2045
01:37:36,725 --> 01:37:39,266
We did not want you to
recollect it and feel the pain,

2046
01:37:39,266 --> 01:37:40,016
that's why we lied!

2047
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:43,308
Sorry dear,

2048
01:37:49,558 --> 01:37:50,141
So,

2049
01:37:50,558 --> 01:37:51,516
You are an Indian!

2050
01:37:51,808 --> 01:37:52,725
I'm

2051
01:37:53,225 --> 01:37:54,558
I... When I saw her
itself I thought

2052
01:37:54,850 --> 01:37:56,558
that she is born to some Indian.

2053
01:37:56,850 --> 01:37:58,308
Seeing her fair hands and legs,

2054
01:37:58,766 --> 01:37:59,683
Seeing her fair hands and legs,
I thought she is a foreigner!

2055
01:38:00,891 --> 01:38:01,766
Which place are you from?

2056
01:38:01,891 --> 01:38:02,641
Tell me properly,

2057
01:38:02,641 --> 01:38:04,850
in all possibility,
you may end up being my aunt's daughter!

2058
01:38:05,016 --> 01:38:05,725
I don't know,
I still need to find out!

2059
01:38:05,725 --> 01:38:06,850
I don't know,
I still need to find out!

2060
01:38:07,850 --> 01:38:09,100
You still have to find out,

2061
01:38:09,725 --> 01:38:10,516
with these guys?

2062
01:38:12,016 --> 01:38:12,558
It's okay,

2063
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:13,225
no problem,

2064
01:38:13,475 --> 01:38:14,433
stay with these guys.

2065
01:38:14,891 --> 01:38:16,433
I thought only they are frauds

2066
01:38:16,433 --> 01:38:17,266
but now I realize,

2067
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:18,266
it's your mother,

2068
01:38:18,433 --> 01:38:19,016
your father,

2069
01:38:19,141 --> 01:38:20,141
your entire family!

2070
01:38:20,475 --> 01:38:21,141
Peter enough!

2071
01:38:21,183 --> 01:38:22,516
Do not speak about my parents!

2072
01:38:22,641 --> 01:38:23,391
I will talk,

2073
01:38:23,683 --> 01:38:24,933
then why did they lie to you,

2074
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:26,641
your entire family are frauds!

2075
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:28,516
Enough is enough Peter,

2076
01:38:28,516 --> 01:38:29,475
get out of my life!

2077
01:38:29,683 --> 01:38:30,183
Okay,

2078
01:38:30,350 --> 01:38:31,016
I will leave.

2079
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:31,350
Go!

2080
01:38:31,475 --> 01:38:32,391
I will never come back.

2081
01:38:32,391 --> 01:38:32,975
go to hell!

2082
01:38:42,225 --> 01:38:43,183
I'm leaving tomorrow,

2083
01:38:43,641 --> 01:38:45,058
Is there any payment left?

2084
01:38:45,433 --> 01:38:46,266
I will pay you,

2085
01:38:46,641 --> 01:38:47,350
anything else?

2086
01:38:50,391 --> 01:38:51,433
It's not your fault,

2087
01:38:51,641 --> 01:38:52,516
it's all my mistake.

2088
01:38:53,183 --> 01:38:54,683
I should never have trusted you!

2089
01:38:54,850 --> 01:38:56,058
But I want to ask you one thing!

2090
01:38:56,308 --> 01:38:57,766
Do you know the
meaning of sacrifice?

2091
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:00,933
You have named yourself
Bharatha and Baahubali,

2092
01:39:01,016 --> 01:39:02,516
you guys are not
worth your names!

2093
01:39:02,725 --> 01:39:03,391
Please change it.

2094
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:08,350
Why are you guys laughing?

2095
01:39:08,725 --> 01:39:10,141
Their stories, do you even know?

2096
01:39:19,558 --> 01:39:21,641
The entire world
which was won by war

2097
01:39:21,766 --> 01:39:23,683
by the Prince of Ayodhya,
Bharatha Chakravarthy

2098
01:39:24,141 --> 01:39:28,308
his brother Baahubali's Bodhanapura
kingdom he wished to conquer

2099
01:39:28,558 --> 01:39:31,600
and become the emperor!

2100
01:39:32,141 --> 01:39:36,725
Directing Baahubali to leave his kingdom
and surrender he sends a message.

2101
01:39:37,016 --> 01:39:40,933
Provoked by Bharatha's arrogance
and swank of Baahubali,

2102
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:43,433
invites his brother
to the battlefield.

2103
01:39:45,516 --> 01:39:48,016
Both agree to fight the battle.

2104
01:39:48,725 --> 01:39:50,350
Due to these two
people's act of war,

2105
01:39:50,350 --> 01:39:55,850
innocent soldiers and animals would become victims
thinking thus, the ministers of both the kingdoms

2106
01:39:56,350 --> 01:39:59,141
arrange for a face off
just between these two.

2107
01:39:59,641 --> 01:40:01,016
As per that,
the first one was...

2108
01:40:01,016 --> 01:40:01,891
The battle of sight;

2109
01:40:02,433 --> 01:40:05,808
Baahubali's intense sight
couldn't be faced by Bharatha

2110
01:40:06,266 --> 01:40:08,558
accepts defeat in
the battle of sight.

2111
01:40:08,975 --> 01:40:10,475
Next was the battle
in the water,

2112
01:40:11,016 --> 01:40:12,975
in front of Baahubali's
immense strength,

2113
01:40:13,433 --> 01:40:15,808
Bharatha gets defeated here too.

2114
01:40:16,433 --> 01:40:18,766
The next one that
happened was wrestling.

2115
01:41:07,933 --> 01:41:09,266
Baahubali!

2116
01:41:09,975 --> 01:41:11,266
Baahubali!

2117
01:41:11,933 --> 01:41:12,933
Baahubali!

2118
01:41:13,891 --> 01:41:15,225
Baahubali!

2119
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:17,308
Baahubali!

2120
01:41:17,850 --> 01:41:19,100
Baahubali!

2121
01:41:19,475 --> 01:41:20,558
Baahubali!

2122
01:41:21,141 --> 01:41:22,391
Baahubali!

2123
01:41:22,808 --> 01:41:23,933
Baahubali!

2124
01:41:24,433 --> 01:41:25,641
Baahubali!

2125
01:41:26,308 --> 01:41:27,433
Baahubali!

2126
01:42:39,641 --> 01:42:40,766
Baahubali!

2127
01:42:41,308 --> 01:42:42,516
Baahubali!

2128
01:42:43,058 --> 01:42:44,266
Baahubali!

2129
01:42:44,808 --> 01:42:46,058
Baahubali!

2130
01:42:46,516 --> 01:42:47,641
Baahubali!

2131
01:42:48,266 --> 01:42:49,516
Baahubali!

2132
01:42:49,975 --> 01:42:51,141
Baahubali!

2133
01:42:51,766 --> 01:42:52,975
Baahubali!

2134
01:42:53,558 --> 01:42:54,766
Baahubali!

2135
01:42:55,433 --> 01:42:56,558
Baahubali!

2136
01:42:57,016 --> 01:42:58,516
Baahubali!

2137
01:42:58,975 --> 01:43:00,225
Baahubali!

2138
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:32,558
Baahubali!

2139
01:43:33,225 --> 01:43:34,433
Baahubali!

2140
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:36,308
Baahubali!

2141
01:43:37,016 --> 01:43:38,141
Baahubali!

2142
01:43:38,683 --> 01:43:39,850
Baahubali!

2143
01:43:40,433 --> 01:43:41,558
Baahubali!

2144
01:43:42,266 --> 01:43:43,475
Baahubali!

2145
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:45,391
Baahubali!

2146
01:43:46,350 --> 01:43:50,225
Even in wrestling,
while on the path of victory, Baahubali

2147
01:43:50,725 --> 01:43:52,600
became aware of the reality.

2148
01:43:53,016 --> 01:43:55,641
Who was the enemy he
was wrestling with?

2149
01:43:56,308 --> 01:43:59,391
The kingdom he had to set out to
win, was after all whose?

2150
01:44:00,225 --> 01:44:00,683
Brother!

2151
01:44:01,475 --> 01:44:02,266
His brother!

2152
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:05,933
King Bharatha was
his very own sibling!

2153
01:44:06,308 --> 01:44:07,641
She was his own sister-in-law!

2154
01:44:08,225 --> 01:44:10,100
In the midst of people's
victory cries too...

2155
01:44:10,558 --> 01:44:13,683
Baahubali remembers his
brother's egotistical affection.

2156
01:44:14,266 --> 01:44:17,350
The brother who shared
the same blood with him,

2157
01:44:17,975 --> 01:44:20,058
for the sake of a
ridiculous kingdom,

2158
01:44:20,725 --> 01:44:24,391
for an impermanent position did
I wrestle with my own brother!

2159
01:44:24,891 --> 01:44:28,350
Gold, woman, mud...
In these illusions, losing myself

2160
01:44:28,808 --> 01:44:32,183
trying to toss and
kill my own brother!

2161
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:34,641
What an inexcusable sinner I am?

2162
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:45,183
With the guilt of a criminal,

2163
01:44:45,516 --> 01:44:48,266
putting his brother
down, Baahubali

2164
01:44:48,641 --> 01:44:51,433
hesitated to even look
at his brother's face.

2165
01:44:51,808 --> 01:44:54,891
His kingdom, wealth,
position and everything else,

2166
01:44:55,350 --> 01:44:58,100
to hand over to his brother
he took the decision!

2167
01:44:59,183 --> 01:45:00,558
Baahubali!

2168
01:45:01,058 --> 01:45:02,225
Baahubali!

2169
01:45:02,850 --> 01:45:04,016
Baahubali!

2170
01:45:04,808 --> 01:45:06,058
Baahubali!

2171
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:07,808
Baahubali!

2172
01:45:08,433 --> 01:45:09,641
Baahubali!

2173
01:45:10,350 --> 01:45:11,558
Baahubali!

2174
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:13,183
Baahubali!

2175
01:45:13,933 --> 01:45:15,058
Baahubali!

2176
01:45:15,725 --> 01:45:16,850
Baahubali!

2177
01:45:17,641 --> 01:45:18,766
Baahubali!

2178
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:20,475
Baahubali!

2179
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:22,308
Baahubali!

2180
01:45:23,891 --> 01:45:27,600
Baahubali's internal
conflict eclipsed Bharatha

2181
01:45:27,933 --> 01:45:31,183
to kill him,
he used his wheelbarrow!

2182
01:45:31,808 --> 01:45:34,725
Baahubali, who was already
on the of asceticism,

2183
01:45:35,308 --> 01:45:38,558
the wheelbarrow circumambulated
Baahubali thrice and vanished.

2184
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:41,058
As per his deep inner voice,

2185
01:45:41,058 --> 01:45:42,766
giving up his kingdom,

2186
01:45:42,766 --> 01:45:43,891
giving it to his brother,

2187
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:46,516
Baahubali renounced everything,

2188
01:45:47,225 --> 01:45:48,225
became an ascetic.

2189
01:45:49,141 --> 01:45:50,558
He became immortal!

2190
01:46:31,766 --> 01:46:32,683
Open the door dear!

2191
01:46:33,266 --> 01:46:33,933
Ankita!

2192
01:46:34,475 --> 01:46:35,266
Ankita!

2193
01:46:35,266 --> 01:46:35,641
Ankita!

2194
01:46:35,641 --> 01:46:36,600
Open the door please!

2195
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:37,016
Ankita!

2196
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,766
What are you doing?
Open the door daughter!

2197
01:46:39,766 --> 01:46:40,808
Open the door! Ankita!

2198
01:46:41,016 --> 01:46:41,683
Ankita!

2199
01:46:41,683 --> 01:46:42,141
Ankita!

2200
01:46:42,141 --> 01:46:42,933
Ankita!

2201
01:46:43,558 --> 01:46:44,350
Open the door dear!

2202
01:46:44,683 --> 01:46:46,725
I beg of you,
please open the door dear.

2203
01:46:48,016 --> 01:46:48,641
She isn't opening the door.

2204
01:46:48,641 --> 01:46:49,225
Ankita!

2205
01:46:49,516 --> 01:46:50,058
Ankita!

2206
01:46:50,391 --> 01:46:51,933
What are you doing? Leave me!

2207
01:46:51,933 --> 01:46:53,183
Get down! Leave me!

2208
01:46:53,933 --> 01:46:55,016
Why? What happened?

2209
01:46:55,016 --> 01:46:55,725
What happened?

2210
01:46:58,308 --> 01:46:59,433
What happened daughter?

2211
01:47:02,725 --> 01:47:04,600
What are you trying
to do my dear?!

2212
01:47:05,058 --> 01:47:06,600
What happened,
tell me daughter...

2213
01:47:18,766 --> 01:47:20,058
Selection, is it?

2214
01:47:20,308 --> 01:47:21,766
At the border, we shall meet...

2215
01:48:24,016 --> 01:48:28,516
If let be,
you are just cow dung...

2216
01:48:28,850 --> 01:48:32,808
If patted together,
you become cowpat,

2217
01:48:33,516 --> 01:48:37,933
If sprayed on lands,
you became a fertilizer,

2218
01:48:38,141 --> 01:48:42,225
If burned,
you become sacred ashes...

2219
01:48:42,641 --> 01:48:50,683
To whom do you belong...
Oh! Human!

2220
01:48:52,100 --> 01:49:00,058
To whom do you belong...
Oh! Human!

2221
01:49:39,891 --> 01:49:41,850
The clouds melt down...

2222
01:49:42,266 --> 01:49:44,225
Raindrops start falling,

2223
01:49:44,683 --> 01:49:46,683
The earth drinks in the rain...

2224
01:49:46,975 --> 01:49:48,891
Farms start sprouting!

2225
01:49:49,391 --> 01:49:56,641
What is your contribution here?
Oh! Human!

2226
01:49:58,850 --> 01:50:00,933
The secret of birth is here...

2227
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:03,225
Deaths get wrapped up here...

2228
01:50:03,641 --> 01:50:05,558
Don't search for anything!

2229
01:50:05,891 --> 01:50:07,850
You will find nothing!

2230
01:50:08,308 --> 01:50:16,433
Fulfill your duties
and exit honorably!

2231
01:50:17,766 --> 01:50:22,266
If let be,
you are just cow dung...

2232
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:26,558
If patted together,
you become cowpat,

2233
01:50:27,266 --> 01:50:31,683
If sprayed on lands,
you became a fertilizer,

2234
01:50:31,891 --> 01:50:35,975
If burned,
you become sacred ashes...

2235
01:50:55,641 --> 01:50:57,850
Thunder strikes!

2236
01:50:57,975 --> 01:51:00,058
The body ruptures!

2237
01:51:00,350 --> 01:51:02,641
Flames surge!

2238
01:51:02,766 --> 01:51:04,766
Floods engulf us!

2239
01:51:05,141 --> 01:51:11,600
You will not be able to
withstand, puny human!

2240
01:51:14,225 --> 01:51:16,683
You don't dream...

2241
01:51:16,975 --> 01:51:18,850
Work hard every day!

2242
01:51:19,266 --> 01:51:21,725
Don't build towards anything!

2243
01:51:21,891 --> 01:51:23,808
Be giving and forgiving!

2244
01:51:24,058 --> 01:51:29,600
No one can forget
your sacrifice!

2245
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:38,100
If let be,
you are just cow dung...

2246
01:51:38,433 --> 01:51:42,391
If patted together,
you become cowpat,

2247
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:47,516
If sprayed on lands,
you became a fertilizer,

2248
01:51:47,725 --> 01:51:51,808
If burned,
you become sacred ashes...

2249
01:52:35,641 --> 01:52:36,391
Dad,

2250
01:52:36,808 --> 01:52:37,766
I'm coming back.

2251
01:52:42,683 --> 01:52:44,350
All that is fine...
But how did you get out?

2252
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:45,850
My lover got me out

2253
01:52:46,141 --> 01:52:47,391
Oh! my, Anu is it?

2254
01:52:47,975 --> 01:52:49,850
Her husband spoke on my
behalf and got me released.

2255
01:52:50,975 --> 01:52:53,850
The ex-lover out, he took a
neutral stand and got released! â€¨

2256
01:52:53,975 --> 01:52:55,350
Who is that generous man? A

2257
01:52:55,891 --> 01:52:58,516
What is it? You really think
are classless like you?

2258
01:52:59,141 --> 01:53:00,391
It is a foreign brand...
Have it!

2259
01:53:00,558 --> 01:53:02,391
Always you used to
drink local brands...

2260
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:03,975
Directly you moved
to a foreign brand!

2261
01:53:04,141 --> 01:53:05,475
This is how it is now!!

2262
01:53:06,266 --> 01:53:08,516
It's from foreign money right?
That's why!

2263
01:53:08,850 --> 01:53:09,391
Bharatha,

2264
01:53:09,891 --> 01:53:10,558
where were you?

2265
01:53:10,683 --> 01:53:12,475
Remembered you ten
times since then!

2266
01:53:12,725 --> 01:53:14,391
It's smelling heavenly, sip it!

2267
01:53:14,558 --> 01:53:15,891
Apart from making me drink,
what else would you do?

2268
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:17,600
At the Pump house,
you have earned so much!

2269
01:53:18,475 --> 01:53:20,600
I swear on you,
I have not even earned a pie bro...

2270
01:53:20,766 --> 01:53:23,558
That wretched one,
without informing me, she just left!

2271
01:53:23,641 --> 01:53:25,891
Looks like you have
started a new business?

2272
01:53:26,183 --> 01:53:27,850
About foreign and the
such, you are talking?

2273
01:53:28,433 --> 01:53:29,558
Take me in too.

2274
01:53:30,266 --> 01:53:32,225
Since my return from the prison,

2275
01:53:32,350 --> 01:53:34,016
no one is even coming near me!

2276
01:53:34,391 --> 01:53:36,350
Even while I go
to shop coriander,

2277
01:53:36,558 --> 01:53:38,016
they look at me as if
they have seen a gangster!

2278
01:53:38,225 --> 01:53:39,641
It's great, let it be dude!

2279
01:53:39,975 --> 01:53:42,100
Hereafter we shall
demand protection money!

2280
01:53:42,266 --> 01:53:43,475
You haven't anyway
grown physically,

2281
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:45,975
at least we will help you grow
socially, isn't it man?

2282
01:53:46,350 --> 01:53:47,641
Using someone,

2283
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:49,100
Crushing someone,

2284
01:53:49,308 --> 01:53:50,558
to whatever height we
grow, what's the use?

2285
01:53:51,058 --> 01:53:52,308
People may just rate you,

2286
01:53:52,516 --> 01:53:53,308
but will never
give you a rating!

2287
01:53:53,516 --> 01:53:56,308
Just because I drank without
you, why are talking rubbish?

2288
01:53:56,516 --> 01:53:57,475
Shri is going back!

2289
01:54:12,391 --> 01:54:13,141
What's your problem?

2290
01:54:13,433 --> 01:54:15,225
I have given the Pump
house money to Baahubali,

2291
01:54:15,350 --> 01:54:15,891
what's with you now?

2292
01:54:16,933 --> 01:54:17,391
Sorry Shri.

2293
01:54:18,141 --> 01:54:18,725
It's OK,

2294
01:54:19,016 --> 01:54:19,808
didn't I tell you right then,

2295
01:54:19,808 --> 01:54:21,058
it's all my fault.

2296
01:54:21,475 --> 01:54:22,600
I'm returning now,

2297
01:54:22,766 --> 01:54:23,975
So please let me go!

2298
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:25,225
It's not your mistake Shri,

2299
01:54:25,558 --> 01:54:26,266
the mistake is all ours!

2300
01:54:26,558 --> 01:54:28,475
For the sake of money it is
true that we tried to cheat you,

2301
01:54:28,683 --> 01:54:29,683
but only later did I realize

2302
01:54:29,683 --> 01:54:31,141
that I'm incapable
of cheating properly!

2303
01:54:31,433 --> 01:54:31,891
Shri,

2304
01:54:32,016 --> 01:54:32,891
just give me one more chance,

2305
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:34,266
I'll search and
find your family!

2306
01:54:35,641 --> 01:54:36,308
Not required,

2307
01:54:36,683 --> 01:54:37,600
neither do you have to search,

2308
01:54:37,725 --> 01:54:38,891
nor do I want my
family to be found.

2309
01:54:39,058 --> 01:54:40,183
I don't trust you guys anymore!

2310
01:54:40,433 --> 01:54:41,725
We, who were in prison
after committing a crime,

2311
01:54:41,766 --> 01:54:42,641
Why did you get us out?

2312
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:44,350
Even then we had committed a
mistake, right?

2313
01:54:44,975 --> 01:54:46,850
Although the whole village was
talking negatively about us

2314
01:54:46,975 --> 01:54:48,100
you trusted us,

2315
01:54:48,433 --> 01:54:49,391
shall I tell u why?

2316
01:54:50,266 --> 01:54:52,808
To believe your past life
story, there was none then!

2317
01:54:52,975 --> 01:54:53,808
But we believed you!

2318
01:54:54,891 --> 01:54:56,100
We acted as if we believed it,

2319
01:54:56,558 --> 01:54:57,391
hence you trusted us.

2320
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:59,641
After being cheated once,
who will believe you guys again?

2321
01:54:59,891 --> 01:55:00,808
Do you think I'm dumb?

2322
01:55:01,183 --> 01:55:02,391
After murdering and
being in prison,

2323
01:55:02,933 --> 01:55:04,850
due to good conduct they have been
released, Such examples are there too!

2324
01:55:05,183 --> 01:55:06,725
Like that,
give us a chance too Shri.

2325
01:55:07,058 --> 01:55:09,141
I will show you to what
extent a man can be honest!

2326
01:55:09,891 --> 01:55:10,141
Please,

2327
01:55:10,225 --> 01:55:10,975
not even a rupee need you pay!

2328
01:55:11,391 --> 01:55:12,183
I will be with you,

2329
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:13,683
searching and finding your
family is my responsibility.

2330
01:55:14,141 --> 01:55:14,558
Please!

2331
01:55:15,141 --> 01:55:16,308
Give me a chance Shri!

2332
01:55:27,558 --> 01:55:28,183
At least from now on,

2333
01:55:28,391 --> 01:55:29,600
we will lead a good life man.

2334
01:55:29,850 --> 01:55:31,308
Let's live in a way that
we are useful to someone.

2335
01:55:31,350 --> 01:55:32,266
I have promised her

2336
01:55:32,433 --> 01:55:33,683
that I will search
and find her family!

2337
01:55:33,933 --> 01:55:35,183
I don't need a rupee
is what I said.

2338
01:55:35,391 --> 01:55:36,391
Please help me do that bro...

2339
01:55:36,516 --> 01:55:37,141
We will do that dude,

2340
01:55:37,433 --> 01:55:38,308
We will surely do that!

2341
01:55:39,016 --> 01:55:39,641
But

2342
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:41,641
not what you have come
here to convince me!

2343
01:55:41,850 --> 01:55:42,266
Then?

2344
01:55:44,266 --> 01:55:45,225
She loves me man

2345
01:55:47,016 --> 01:55:47,933
After drinking,
don't blabber whatever you want!

2346
01:55:49,016 --> 01:55:50,350
You can't understand,
stay quiet!

2347
01:55:50,516 --> 01:55:52,516
That day when I was giving
her the Machine House key

2348
01:55:52,641 --> 01:55:53,933
she was hiding a nd
watching me only!

2349
01:55:54,141 --> 01:55:55,975
Who do I have other than her?

2350
01:55:56,225 --> 01:55:57,933
I'm single and
she is single too!

2351
01:55:58,225 --> 01:56:00,600
Now I go in the Machine House
and we both will mingle!

2352
01:56:05,058 --> 01:56:06,016
Where are you going man?

2353
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:07,308
Sweetheart, where are you?

2354
01:56:07,433 --> 01:56:09,850
Who is haunting my mind...

2355
01:56:15,641 --> 01:56:17,100
They are immersed in love,

2356
01:56:17,266 --> 01:56:18,933
why are your eyes
immersed in tears?

2357
01:56:19,475 --> 01:56:20,308
Due to the smoke man!

2358
01:56:25,933 --> 01:56:27,641
When do we collect
Protection money?

2359
01:56:27,808 --> 01:56:29,350
Protection money!
You want Protection money!

2360
01:56:52,266 --> 01:56:52,975
What happened Shri?

2361
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:03,600
I made a mistake!

2362
01:57:04,475 --> 01:57:05,183
Baahubali,

2363
01:57:05,558 --> 01:57:06,391
why are you crying?

2364
01:57:06,725 --> 01:57:07,891
I made a mistake!

2365
01:57:08,766 --> 01:57:09,600
Just a minute.

2366
01:57:10,308 --> 01:57:10,850
Take this!

2367
01:57:12,475 --> 01:57:13,141
What is this?

2368
01:57:13,391 --> 01:57:15,225
The money you had given me...

2369
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:18,058
Everything was spent of that
and only this much is remaining,

2370
01:57:18,225 --> 01:57:18,725
keep it!

2371
01:57:19,308 --> 01:57:22,141
Your debt, how do I
repay, I don't know!

2372
01:57:23,808 --> 01:57:25,308
In the next birth,

2373
01:57:25,516 --> 01:57:26,683
I will be born as your lover.

2374
01:57:26,975 --> 01:57:27,516
Baahubali,

2375
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:28,433
what are you saying?

2376
01:57:28,641 --> 01:57:29,683
Just shut up,

2377
01:57:29,808 --> 01:57:31,391
Your English should get
entangled in my sandals!

2378
01:57:32,391 --> 01:57:34,808
Now that you know that you
are born to Kannada folk?

2379
01:57:34,975 --> 01:57:35,808
talk in Kannada.

2380
01:57:37,891 --> 01:57:39,558
I have a personal matter,

2381
01:57:41,016 --> 01:57:42,058
don't tell anyone?

2382
01:57:42,058 --> 01:57:42,600
What is it?

2383
01:57:43,141 --> 01:57:44,641
My dad drinks daily,

2384
01:57:44,933 --> 01:57:46,183
I too drink every day,

2385
01:57:46,391 --> 01:57:47,558
you too learn!

2386
01:57:47,725 --> 01:57:49,975
Slowly teach my mom too.

2387
01:57:50,308 --> 01:57:53,016
On weekends, all four of us
together, can drink to the fullest!

2388
01:57:54,475 --> 01:57:56,725
My house is a bit small,
you will have to adjust with it.

2389
01:57:58,058 --> 01:57:59,391
You will adjust right,

2390
01:57:59,391 --> 01:58:01,808
in this machine house you are
already living like Queen Elizabeth!

2391
01:58:01,891 --> 01:58:02,975
Later in our house,

2392
01:58:03,225 --> 01:58:06,683
you can like a deer, run
around, drink and fall off.

2393
01:58:09,891 --> 01:58:10,766
You didn't understand
anything, right?

2394
01:58:11,183 --> 01:58:11,808
I don't know.

2395
01:58:11,975 --> 01:58:13,183
I didn't understand anything.

2396
01:58:13,933 --> 01:58:14,433
Okay!

2397
01:58:14,808 --> 01:58:15,391
I will manage.

2398
01:58:17,725 --> 01:58:18,225
Rape!

2399
01:58:18,433 --> 01:58:19,350
Rape attempt!

2400
01:58:19,641 --> 01:58:21,350
Under no circumstances should
you show her your face!

2401
01:58:22,225 --> 01:58:23,308
If this matter is
known in the village,

2402
01:58:23,558 --> 01:58:24,433
do you know what will happen?

2403
01:58:24,850 --> 01:58:25,766
I will fall to your feet,

2404
01:58:26,225 --> 01:58:28,725
only if someone tells it will
someone in the village know...

2405
01:58:28,891 --> 01:58:30,641
I will also not talk about it,
you too don't talk about it!

2406
01:58:30,641 --> 01:58:31,766
It's about my
respect and standing.

2407
01:58:31,766 --> 01:58:32,225
Please dude!

2408
01:58:32,391 --> 01:58:33,308
I may be quiet,

2409
01:58:33,725 --> 01:58:34,600
will she be quiet?

2410
01:58:35,141 --> 01:58:35,933
First of all she is a foreigner!

2411
01:58:36,183 --> 01:58:37,600
If a case is lodged,
you will be permanently stuck inside.

2412
01:58:38,808 --> 01:58:40,433
Only when you commit a
mistake, will one be punished;

2413
01:58:40,850 --> 01:58:42,475
The mistake that I have done,
I will correct it myself.

2414
01:58:42,808 --> 01:58:45,183
The pot that I made a hole in,
I will only drink, let it be dude!

2415
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:46,308
What are you saying dear?

2416
01:58:47,683 --> 01:58:48,225
To her,

2417
01:58:48,683 --> 01:58:49,641
I will give a life!

2418
01:58:50,475 --> 01:58:50,891
Bro,

2419
01:58:51,683 --> 01:58:52,475
let her go man!

2420
01:58:52,766 --> 01:58:54,016
You are not at fault here man!

2421
01:58:54,183 --> 01:58:55,683
I simply cooked up stories man.

2422
01:58:55,766 --> 01:58:57,766
Hoping you will stay away from
her, I did this, that's all!

2423
01:58:58,058 --> 01:58:58,766
She's mine dude,

2424
01:58:58,933 --> 01:59:00,058
I love her dude...

2425
01:59:00,308 --> 01:59:00,975
Please man, just leave her man!

2426
01:59:00,975 --> 01:59:02,558
Get up Bharatha, get up!

2427
01:59:04,725 --> 01:59:06,016
Opulence is for the rich

2428
01:59:06,141 --> 01:59:07,141
happiness is for the poor!

2429
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:08,766
Life is as given to us by God,

2430
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:10,100
Longevity is in the hands
of the God of death!

2431
01:59:11,433 --> 01:59:12,350
Outcome of our toil
is decided by the mud,

2432
01:59:12,683 --> 01:59:13,725
fate is decided by the almighty!

2433
01:59:13,933 --> 01:59:15,141
What is yours here, my man?

2434
01:59:16,516 --> 01:59:17,975
She is mine, she is
mine, you are saying,

2435
01:59:18,183 --> 01:59:20,016
you can marry her
and go to hell!

2436
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:21,475
Love is just for three days

2437
01:59:21,683 --> 01:59:23,141
and wishes are
only for six days.

2438
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:25,141
You mad men!

2439
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:33,766
In this meaningless life on earth
A woman is like the top of a cliff,

2440
01:59:33,975 --> 01:59:37,766
A black cloud from somewhere
covered this world,

2441
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:41,975
When will humanity progress...

2442
01:59:53,208 --> 01:59:53,833
Hi Shri!

2443
01:59:55,875 --> 01:59:56,833
My entire family,

2444
01:59:57,458 --> 01:59:58,875
And all my relatives...

2445
01:59:59,333 --> 02:00:01,166
And all my friends

2446
02:00:01,333 --> 02:00:02,458
Are telling me one thing Shri...

2447
02:00:02,708 --> 02:00:04,125
'Settle down in life, Bharatha,

2448
02:00:04,125 --> 02:00:05,166
settle down in life!'

2449
02:00:05,958 --> 02:00:06,500
So...

2450
02:00:06,833 --> 02:00:07,875
I have decided Shri,

2451
02:00:08,083 --> 02:00:09,375
to settle down in life.

2452
02:00:10,916 --> 02:00:11,875
If you say yes,

2453
02:00:12,041 --> 02:00:13,166
we could talk to Mudde Gowda

2454
02:00:13,166 --> 02:00:14,250
go through the marital rituals

2455
02:00:14,250 --> 02:00:15,416
and get married in a simple way!

2456
02:00:16,333 --> 02:00:17,458
Or if you want it to be grand

2457
02:00:17,458 --> 02:00:18,625
we could have a
reception in foreign

2458
02:00:18,875 --> 02:00:19,916
Anything is fine with me!

2459
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:23,291
Although we cheated you so much,

2460
02:00:23,458 --> 02:00:24,625
if have still stayed back here,

2461
02:00:25,541 --> 02:00:26,583
it's for me Shri,

2462
02:00:26,916 --> 02:00:27,541
I know Shri.

2463
02:00:28,250 --> 02:00:29,041
Hope you understand.

2464
02:00:29,666 --> 02:00:30,458
Hope you understand.

2465
02:00:30,541 --> 02:00:31,375
Oh, illusion!

2466
02:00:31,916 --> 02:00:32,791
What an Illusion!

2467
02:00:32,916 --> 02:00:33,500
Gunda!

2468
02:00:34,833 --> 02:00:35,416
No dear,

2469
02:00:35,708 --> 02:00:36,583
Why are you beating me thus?

2470
02:00:37,791 --> 02:00:39,208
I will turn the illusion into
reality, wait and see!

2471
02:01:01,291 --> 02:01:01,916
I...

2472
02:01:02,625 --> 02:01:03,083
Hi!

2473
02:01:03,375 --> 02:01:03,833
Hi!

2474
02:01:04,583 --> 02:01:05,208
Whose eye are they?

2475
02:01:05,416 --> 02:01:06,791
These eyes appear in my dream.

2476
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,625
When I see these
eyes they scare me!

2477
02:01:09,083 --> 02:01:10,250
It has a criminal look,

2478
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:10,875
see...

2479
02:01:14,416 --> 02:01:15,541
Whose ever eye you see,

2480
02:01:15,916 --> 02:01:17,416
can you understand the
feelings behind it?

2481
02:01:17,583 --> 02:01:19,125
About face reading, I have read,

2482
02:01:19,416 --> 02:01:20,791
so to an extent
I can understand,

2483
02:01:20,958 --> 02:01:21,541
Why?

2484
02:01:23,083 --> 02:01:23,708
Look at my eyes and tell,

2485
02:01:24,375 --> 02:01:25,208
What do you feel?

2486
02:01:31,541 --> 02:01:32,958
You have come here
to tell me something.

2487
02:01:33,458 --> 02:01:34,625
Come on, tell me what is it?

2488
02:01:34,875 --> 02:01:35,708
If I had so much guts,

2489
02:01:35,708 --> 02:01:36,875
I would have married
and had kids by now!

2490
02:01:37,041 --> 02:01:38,583
Do you have an
inferiority complex?

2491
02:01:39,625 --> 02:01:41,041
Girls mostly put up an
act, Shri!

2492
02:01:41,291 --> 02:01:42,750
Not everything has to
be verbally expressed.

2493
02:01:42,958 --> 02:01:44,125
They understand everything,

2494
02:01:44,291 --> 02:01:46,083
Still they expect
to hear it verbally!

2495
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:47,625
Some cannot express,

2496
02:01:47,958 --> 02:01:49,666
to them,
they say good bye and leave

2497
02:01:50,125 --> 02:01:51,208
What kind of girls?

2498
02:01:51,416 --> 02:01:52,500
What are you talking about?

2499
02:01:52,625 --> 02:01:53,708
I don't understand anything!

2500
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:54,750
Close by

2501
02:01:55,083 --> 02:01:56,375
is a temple called
Devirama Temple.

2502
02:01:56,583 --> 02:01:57,666
There anything that we ask for,

2503
02:01:57,916 --> 02:01:58,833
will come true it seems.

2504
02:01:59,125 --> 02:02:00,375
I came to take you there.

2505
02:02:00,875 --> 02:02:01,750
This is what I came
here to tell you.

2506
02:02:01,916 --> 02:02:02,416
No, no!

2507
02:02:02,666 --> 02:02:03,875
You are not here
to tell me that,

2508
02:02:04,333 --> 02:02:05,166
There's something else.

2509
02:02:06,375 --> 02:02:07,000
Bharatha!

2510
02:02:07,458 --> 02:02:08,416
You are hiding something.

2511
02:02:08,666 --> 02:02:09,500
Tell me what is it?

2512
02:02:11,541 --> 02:02:12,708
I have already told you,

2513
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:13,916
I hope you understand!

2514
02:02:15,750 --> 02:02:16,291
Bye...

2515
02:02:32,458 --> 02:02:33,666
In my eyes,

2516
02:02:34,291 --> 02:02:35,583
in my eyes...

2517
02:02:36,541 --> 02:02:39,291
I loved you when I
set my eyes on you...

2518
02:02:40,250 --> 02:02:41,500
In my heart,

2519
02:02:42,291 --> 02:02:43,833
in my heart...

2520
02:02:44,541 --> 02:02:47,875
In my heart, in my heart...
I worshipped you, from far...

2521
02:02:49,166 --> 02:02:52,458
Do we need words,

2522
02:02:52,541 --> 02:02:56,500
Those are just to
advertise love...

2523
02:02:57,083 --> 02:03:00,416
Do we need poetry?

2524
02:03:00,625 --> 02:03:03,291
That is how imagination goes...

2525
02:03:04,291 --> 02:03:05,500
In my eyes,

2526
02:03:06,125 --> 02:03:07,416
in my eyes...

2527
02:03:08,375 --> 02:03:12,000
I loved you when I
set my eyes on you...

2528
02:03:55,375 --> 02:03:58,916
To understand love...

2529
02:03:59,375 --> 02:04:01,333
Do you need a degree?

2530
02:04:03,375 --> 02:04:07,083
To draw emotions...

2531
02:04:07,291 --> 02:04:09,458
Do you need a brush?

2532
02:04:11,166 --> 02:04:14,791
Does the fish that
swims in the water,

2533
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:18,916
ever say 'I Love You'?

2534
02:04:19,125 --> 02:04:22,708
Does the bird that
flies in the sky,

2535
02:04:23,166 --> 02:04:26,666
ever say 'I Miss You'?

2536
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:30,333
Do you need languages?

2537
02:04:30,666 --> 02:04:34,791
This love is irresistible!

2538
02:04:35,083 --> 02:04:38,666
Do you need religions?

2539
02:04:38,666 --> 02:04:41,958
This love has crossed borders!

2540
02:04:42,291 --> 02:04:43,500
In my eyes,

2541
02:04:44,125 --> 02:04:45,416
in my eyes...

2542
02:04:46,375 --> 02:04:49,666
I loved you when I
set my eyes on you...

2543
02:05:27,166 --> 02:05:31,000
To the heart, a mirror...

2544
02:05:31,416 --> 02:05:33,375
Do you need to hold?

2545
02:05:35,375 --> 02:05:39,125
For love, a prelude...

2546
02:05:39,375 --> 02:05:41,583
Does it need to be written?

2547
02:05:43,250 --> 02:05:46,875
Does the bee sitting
on the flower...

2548
02:05:47,166 --> 02:05:50,833
Ever say, 'How Sweet Are You'!

2549
02:05:51,250 --> 02:05:54,833
Does the life born
on this earth...

2550
02:05:55,041 --> 02:05:58,833
Ever say, 'I Thank You'!

2551
02:05:59,166 --> 02:06:02,458
Is it not only in silence?

2552
02:06:02,666 --> 02:06:06,333
There exists a
feeling of gratitude?

2553
02:06:07,041 --> 02:06:10,541
Is it not only in the heart?

2554
02:06:10,708 --> 02:06:13,708
That we bestow
ourselves as a flower?

2555
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:15,708
In my eyes,

2556
02:06:16,333 --> 02:06:17,625
in my eyes...

2557
02:06:18,583 --> 02:06:21,875
I loved you when I
set my eyes on you...

2558
02:06:54,041 --> 02:06:54,583
Shri, look there!

2559
02:06:56,583 --> 02:06:57,541
Our village fair has started,

2560
02:06:57,875 --> 02:06:59,000
Giant wheel has come too.

2561
02:06:59,708 --> 02:07:00,750
Let's both go on it!

2562
02:07:00,916 --> 02:07:02,375
Are you crazy? No!

2563
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:09,750
Who's that guy?

2564
02:07:10,958 --> 02:07:11,583
A film actor.

2565
02:07:12,416 --> 02:07:13,208
A film actor.

2566
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:14,625
Yeah, new-comer.

2567
02:07:15,416 --> 02:07:15,833
Brother...

2568
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,208
Just tell a dialogue bro!

2569
02:07:17,458 --> 02:07:18,625
For the Sun and Moon,

2570
02:07:18,833 --> 02:07:20,583
once in a year they
face an eclipse.

2571
02:07:20,750 --> 02:07:21,708
If I seize,

2572
02:07:21,875 --> 02:07:23,333
the entire year
will be eclipsed!

2573
02:07:23,666 --> 02:07:24,625
Will you drink juice?

2574
02:07:24,833 --> 02:07:25,458
Will you drink?

2575
02:07:25,666 --> 02:07:26,375
Will you drink?

2576
02:07:26,541 --> 02:07:27,375
Juice will you drink?

2577
02:07:28,208 --> 02:07:28,958
Super bro!

2578
02:07:29,416 --> 02:07:31,125
What a dialogue brother,

2579
02:07:31,333 --> 02:07:33,750
with your dialogue I'm
totally carried away.

2580
02:07:33,958 --> 02:07:35,416
I'm your big fan brother.

2581
02:07:36,375 --> 02:07:37,625
There's so much craze for
him, isn't it?

2582
02:07:38,791 --> 02:07:39,333
Craze?

2583
02:07:40,500 --> 02:07:41,541
Craze is not that!

2584
02:07:42,208 --> 02:07:42,958
Craze is what our boss has!

2585
02:07:43,375 --> 02:07:44,375
He was the King of Craze!

2586
02:07:45,291 --> 02:07:46,250
He was the King of Craze!

2587
02:07:48,916 --> 02:07:50,916

He was the one who

2609
02:08:55,166 --> 02:08:55,958
Look properly dude,

2610
02:08:56,750 --> 02:08:57,750
Rajkumar!

2611
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,291
I want to watch his movie.

2612
02:09:06,166 --> 02:09:07,000
Take, drink this coffee.

2613
02:09:07,125 --> 02:09:07,791
I don't want!

2614
02:09:10,500 --> 02:09:12,041
If you drink coffee,
I'll show you your mother.

2615
02:09:12,458 --> 02:09:13,458
Will you definitely show me?!

2616
02:09:13,500 --> 02:09:14,208
For sure,

2617
02:09:14,375 --> 02:09:14,708
Take it!

2618
02:09:20,208 --> 02:09:21,125

I know!

2621
02:09:23,125 --> 02:09:24,541
To talk about this boy, right?

2622
02:09:24,625 --> 02:09:25,541
You don't believe all this.

2623
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:26,458
He's a fake!

2624
02:09:26,583 --> 02:09:32,250
An illusion!

2625
02:09:33,125 --> 02:09:39,125
An illusion!

2626
02:09:39,833 --> 02:09:45,583
Dark clouds are hanging over!

2627
02:09:46,291 --> 02:09:51,958
In the light, it is hidden!

2628
02:09:53,041 --> 02:09:56,083
In the heart,
a streak of thunder!

2629
02:09:56,083 --> 02:10:00,000
Is sitting in the
heart of the skies!

2630
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:05,000
An illusion!

2631
02:10:06,041 --> 02:10:12,750
Come fast towards me!
Away from your dreams!

2632
02:10:12,916 --> 02:10:18,250
An illusion!

2633
02:10:45,666 --> 02:10:52,125
To the heart that is scared stiff!
I will firmly show you a way!

2634
02:10:55,666 --> 02:10:58,750
An illusion! An illusion!

2635
02:10:58,833 --> 02:11:02,291
An illusion!

2636
02:11:03,125 --> 02:11:06,250
An illusion!

2637
02:11:06,541 --> 02:11:12,250
An illusion!

2638
02:11:13,750 --> 02:11:14,750
An illusion!

2639
02:11:15,333 --> 02:11:16,333
An illusion!

2640
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,125
An illusion!

2641
02:11:19,083 --> 02:11:19,833
An illusion!

2642
02:11:20,416 --> 02:11:21,250
An illusion!

2643
02:11:21,833 --> 02:11:23,083
An illusion!

2644
02:11:23,958 --> 02:11:25,041
An illusion!

2645
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:31,125
Look Shri!

2646
02:11:32,208 --> 02:11:33,916
In our village,
this is the only ruined well!

2647
02:11:34,666 --> 02:11:36,291
In your dream the one that
appears, check if this is it.

2648
02:12:22,333 --> 02:12:22,625
Bharatha,

2649
02:12:22,625 --> 02:12:23,583
I'm pretty sure,

2650
02:12:23,583 --> 02:12:24,916
This is the well.

2651
02:12:25,791 --> 02:12:26,458
It is!

2652
02:12:52,541 --> 02:12:53,416
Who's that kid?

2653
02:13:12,875 --> 02:13:14,125
Come, come! Come to the side,

2654
02:13:14,125 --> 02:13:14,916
Move, move, Sir is coming.

2655
02:13:14,916 --> 02:13:15,708
All of you move back!
Come, come!

2656
02:13:15,708 --> 02:13:16,125
Come sir!

2657
02:13:16,208 --> 02:13:17,833
Take the children to the back lady.
Move back!

2658
02:13:17,833 --> 02:13:19,083
All of you move back!
Move, move! Take them.

2659
02:13:19,083 --> 02:13:20,000
I'm telling, Can't you hear?

2660
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,125
Move, move, Move back,
move back everyone!

2661
02:13:21,208 --> 02:13:22,625
Lady, to you,
Should I specially tell?

2662
02:13:22,625 --> 02:13:23,291
Move to that side woman!

2663
02:13:23,291 --> 02:13:23,750
Go, go back!

2664
02:13:23,916 --> 02:13:24,625
Move, move!

2665
02:13:24,625 --> 02:13:25,958
Go man!
How many times to yell to you?

2666
02:13:25,958 --> 02:13:27,208
Move, to you only I'm telling.

2667
02:13:28,666 --> 02:13:30,333
Move, to you only I'm telling.

2668
02:13:36,958 --> 02:13:38,250
Why did you come near the well?

2669
02:13:39,208 --> 02:13:40,583
Sir, when she was a kid,

2670
02:13:40,750 --> 02:13:42,375
In the same well,
They tried killing her.

2671
02:13:42,750 --> 02:13:45,250
After coming near the well,
Her past, she was able to recall.

2672
02:13:46,083 --> 02:13:48,875
that child's body has been identified.
That child is theirs sir.

2673
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:49,333
Yess,

2674
02:13:49,541 --> 02:13:51,333
I am able to remember
that face very well,

2675
02:13:51,458 --> 02:13:52,083
I can draw!

2676
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:54,875
Just like he did the to the
baby, He trired to kill me!

2677
02:13:56,833 --> 02:13:57,125
Sir,

2678
02:13:57,500 --> 02:13:58,875
that child's body
has been identified.

2679
02:13:59,208 --> 02:14:00,333
That child is theirs sir.

2680
02:14:00,791 --> 02:14:02,541
On the body, on seeing these
clothes, she identified sir.

2681
02:14:02,875 --> 02:14:04,875
Since the fishes have eaten
away the face is unrecognizable

2682
02:14:05,041 --> 02:14:05,791
We are unable to identify it.

2683
02:14:06,250 --> 02:14:07,416
That child is yours only.

2684
02:14:07,625 --> 02:14:08,375
Yess sir!

2685
02:14:08,375 --> 02:14:10,250
In the fair,
the child was lost sir!

2686
02:14:15,625 --> 02:14:17,791
Mama!

2687
02:14:18,375 --> 02:14:20,625
Sir, however much we searched,
we couldn't find her sir.

2688
02:14:22,083 --> 02:14:24,041
Now she's found
like a corpse sir!

2689
02:14:26,166 --> 02:14:28,875
See, this body has to be sent for
post mortem and handed overto them.

2690
02:14:28,875 --> 02:14:30,625
And tomorrow, the both of
you, come to the station.

2691
02:14:30,958 --> 02:14:31,708
Yes sir.

2692
02:16:31,791 --> 02:16:32,333
Leave man!

2693
02:16:33,250 --> 02:16:34,041
Leave man!

2694
02:16:46,666 --> 02:16:47,125
Hello,

2695
02:16:47,291 --> 02:16:47,958
Hello Bharatha!

2696
02:16:47,958 --> 02:16:49,916
Please, please come soon please!

2697
02:18:56,125 --> 02:18:56,708
Shri!

2698
02:19:04,416 --> 02:19:05,083
Bharatha!

2699
02:19:06,625 --> 02:19:07,416
Bharatha!

2700
02:19:12,583 --> 02:19:13,666
Bharatha!

2701
02:19:20,541 --> 02:19:21,166
There!

2702
02:19:42,708 --> 02:19:44,291
Bharatha...

2703
02:19:50,833 --> 02:19:52,125
Bharatha...

2704
02:20:35,708 --> 02:20:37,583
You Bastard...

2705
02:20:50,375 --> 02:20:50,875
Shri

2706
02:21:05,875 --> 02:21:06,916
How's Shri now?

2707
02:21:07,416 --> 02:21:07,958
Better sir,

2708
02:21:08,166 --> 02:21:08,958
she is conscious now.

2709
02:21:09,541 --> 02:21:10,541
What did the doctor say?

2710
02:21:13,458 --> 02:21:14,791
Doctor,
what has happened to her?

2711
02:21:14,958 --> 02:21:16,208
It's a kind of phobia.

2712
02:21:19,625 --> 02:21:21,250
The incident that
happened in her childhood,

2713
02:21:21,416 --> 02:21:23,250
has remained as it is in
her sub-conscious mind!

2714
02:21:23,625 --> 02:21:26,458
To the police, since she has given
information about that criminal,

2715
02:21:26,625 --> 02:21:29,875
What if he attacks me again is
the fear that is haunting her.

2716
02:21:31,500 --> 02:21:33,833
It was that fear,
that helped her to identify him.

2717
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,125
At the right time,
since you too went there,

2718
02:21:51,375 --> 02:21:53,916
Along with you,
she thinks she has caught him!

2719
02:21:55,458 --> 02:21:55,875
Bharatha!

2720
02:22:01,208 --> 02:22:01,791
There...

2721
02:22:08,833 --> 02:22:11,333
But about that criminal,
did you get any information?

2722
02:22:11,666 --> 02:22:12,583
Turn around...

2723
02:22:12,583 --> 02:22:13,458
Have a look at the cell.

2724
02:22:32,375 --> 02:22:33,208
Sir, he?

2725
02:22:33,958 --> 02:22:35,000
As the doctor said,

2726
02:22:35,750 --> 02:22:37,666
Shri's imagining him

2727
02:22:38,083 --> 02:22:40,625
and him coming to
attack Shri is true.

2728
02:22:40,916 --> 02:22:41,833
What are you saying sir?

2729
02:22:42,333 --> 02:22:44,125
It is only after Shri
drew his picture,

2730
02:22:44,416 --> 02:22:46,041
It is only after Shri drew his picture,
that we started searching for him.

2731
02:22:47,708 --> 02:22:48,958
Getting to know this,

2732
02:22:49,041 --> 02:22:51,583
again he has tried to attack Shri
and has come to try and kill her!

2733
02:22:53,708 --> 02:22:57,500
On that day, since you came there,
seeing you, he has tried to escape!

2734
02:22:59,208 --> 02:22:59,833
Shri!

2735
02:23:04,208 --> 02:23:06,541
aThen when I was in the patrol,
he came right in front of my jeep.

2736
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,666
After bringing him from there,
and after we thrashed him

2737
02:23:12,750 --> 02:23:14,291
all the information
he has spilt out!

2738
02:23:18,583 --> 02:23:21,666
Seeing him after so many
years, Shri is in shock.

2739
02:23:22,875 --> 02:23:24,083
Even after he left from there,

2740
02:23:24,083 --> 02:23:26,250
He was still there,
is the illusion that gripped her!

2741
02:23:26,958 --> 02:23:29,208
Also, all these things,
please don't discuss with Shri.

2742
02:23:29,583 --> 02:23:31,583
To the hospital,
I will only come and meet her.

2743
02:23:32,041 --> 02:23:32,583
Okay Sir.

2744
02:23:33,166 --> 02:23:33,708
Thank you.

2745
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:36,416
Greetings sir...

2746
02:23:36,500 --> 02:23:37,000
Greetings...

2747
02:23:38,666 --> 02:23:39,375
How are you now?

2748
02:23:39,666 --> 02:23:40,291
Better sir.

2749
02:23:40,500 --> 02:23:42,583
If you would not have given
information about him,

2750
02:23:42,791 --> 02:23:44,750
I don't know how many more
kids bodies would have fallen!

2751
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:46,416
Thanks a lot.

2752
02:23:46,833 --> 02:23:47,291
It's OK!

2753
02:23:47,541 --> 02:23:50,083
At fairs, he used to target
children who were alone.

2754
02:23:50,833 --> 02:23:53,250
You too,
he has targeted in a similar way!

2755
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,583
Old reports of missing children,
will it be available sir?

2756
02:24:10,416 --> 02:24:12,291
All the complaint details,
we will have the records with us!

2757
02:24:14,208 --> 02:24:14,666
Bharatha,

2758
02:24:15,708 --> 02:24:17,333
my parents too would
have complained right?

2759
02:24:19,041 --> 02:24:19,458
Sir,

2760
02:24:19,958 --> 02:24:20,708
please sir?

2761
02:24:20,708 --> 02:24:22,375
Can I check the old records?

2762
02:24:22,583 --> 02:24:24,583
Shri, after you get discharged,
do come to our station,

2763
02:24:24,583 --> 02:24:25,666
I will have informed
my staff to help you!

2764
02:24:26,166 --> 02:24:26,791
Thank you sir.

2765
02:24:28,016 --> 02:24:30,641
Instead of properly holding
to your parents hands

2766
02:24:30,682 --> 02:24:31,974
where the hell where
are you roaming about?

2767
02:24:32,224 --> 02:24:34,599
You are asking me to
look for the file now?

2768
02:24:34,724 --> 02:24:36,807
Among all these files,
how should I find the file for you?

2769
02:24:37,932 --> 02:24:39,557
When were you lost?

2770
02:24:39,932 --> 02:24:41,474
During the time of Baahubali
12th Year Grand Anointment.

2771
02:24:41,557 --> 02:24:43,641
It keeps occurring
once every 12 years.

2772
02:24:43,932 --> 02:24:46,057
When did you get
lost, how do I know?

2773
02:24:47,391 --> 02:24:48,891
Why is she talking like this?

2774
02:24:49,641 --> 02:24:51,349
Sister seems to be
all hot and bothered.

2775
02:24:51,349 --> 02:24:52,724
We have to calm her
down, wait, wait, wait!

2776
02:24:53,307 --> 02:24:53,766
Sister,

2777
02:24:53,932 --> 02:24:54,807
please come here to
the side for a minute.

2778
02:24:56,099 --> 02:24:57,391
How dare you call
me to the side.

2779
02:24:58,307 --> 02:24:59,891
I'll put a #metoo case on you!

2780
02:25:00,016 --> 02:25:00,766
In spite of me calling you
sister, you will do that?

2781
02:25:01,349 --> 02:25:03,432
I called you to
talk about the bribe

2782
02:25:05,099 --> 02:25:06,641
There are CCTV cameras here

2783
02:25:06,807 --> 02:25:07,891
you're trying to
give it to my hand.

2784
02:25:08,016 --> 02:25:08,474
Go...

2785
02:25:08,599 --> 02:25:10,932
Go there to the second row
and put it in the second file.

2786
02:25:15,224 --> 02:25:15,724
Sister,

2787
02:25:16,016 --> 02:25:16,516
Sister,

2788
02:25:17,266 --> 02:25:17,766
Shall I put it here.

2789
02:25:18,141 --> 02:25:18,432
Yes.

2790
02:25:20,099 --> 02:25:21,266
Come here dear child,

2791
02:25:22,057 --> 02:25:23,557
when did you get lost?

2792
02:25:24,141 --> 02:25:25,766
During Baahubali 12th
Year Grand Anointment.

2793
02:25:32,891 --> 02:25:33,682
I found the file, look!

2794
02:25:38,516 --> 02:25:39,307
In that year,

2795
02:25:39,474 --> 02:25:41,099
this file has the names of
children lost that year.

2796
02:25:41,474 --> 02:25:42,849
Is there a Shri in this file?

2797
02:25:44,057 --> 02:25:45,099
Shri, is it?

2798
02:25:45,307 --> 02:25:47,266
There's nobody by the name
Shri in this file child.

2799
02:25:47,766 --> 02:25:49,182
It's has got only
boys names here.

2800
02:25:59,349 --> 02:26:00,474
Mostly your parents

2801
02:26:00,682 --> 02:26:01,932
have not lodged a
complaint then Shri.

2802
02:26:02,891 --> 02:26:03,682
Don't be upset!

2803
02:26:05,057 --> 02:26:05,974
It's my bad luck.

2804
02:26:07,516 --> 02:26:09,516
In a week's time my
visa will expire.

2805
02:26:10,016 --> 02:26:11,724
If I find them by
then it's okay,

2806
02:26:12,016 --> 02:26:13,849
otherwise I will
never come back.

2807
02:26:14,891 --> 02:26:16,141
Please do something Bharatha.

2808
02:26:20,057 --> 02:26:21,016
Her name is Shri.

2809
02:26:21,266 --> 02:26:22,349
She has come from abroad.

2810
02:26:22,557 --> 02:26:23,766
In her childhood...

2811
02:26:24,557 --> 02:26:25,099
Lady,

2812
02:26:25,307 --> 02:26:27,266
don't you see the camera placed there?
Shoo your animal away fast!

2813
02:26:28,474 --> 02:26:28,932
Take 2,

2814
02:26:29,016 --> 02:26:29,474
Ready...

2815
02:26:30,016 --> 02:26:31,016
Her name is Shri.

2816
02:26:31,141 --> 02:26:32,266
She has come from abroad.

2817
02:26:32,724 --> 02:26:34,391
In her childhood..

2818
02:26:35,266 --> 02:26:35,682
Lady...

2819
02:26:35,807 --> 02:26:36,891
Cover the camera
with your basket!

2820
02:26:37,141 --> 02:26:38,182
Lady, move quickly,
can't you see the camera,

2821
02:26:38,266 --> 02:26:39,891
I'm covering the news here.

2822
02:26:41,307 --> 02:26:42,307
Her name is Shri.

2823
02:26:42,682 --> 02:26:43,182
Poor thing,

2824
02:26:43,599 --> 02:26:45,599
she doesn't know
who her parents are.

2825
02:27:11,849 --> 02:27:13,516
Lots of people have
arrived here Smitha.

2826
02:27:13,849 --> 02:27:16,266
Among all these people,
to find who her real parents are...

2827
02:27:16,266 --> 02:27:17,516
Is causing a head ache!

2828
02:27:17,891 --> 02:27:19,599
The minute I find
out, I will call you.

2829
02:27:19,807 --> 02:27:21,349
This is the cameraman
cum reporter

2830
02:27:21,599 --> 02:27:23,141
Tony TV Right!

2831
02:27:23,432 --> 02:27:23,974
Daughter...

2832
02:27:24,932 --> 02:27:26,474
I'm your real father!

2833
02:27:28,932 --> 02:27:30,182
On these very same shoulders

2834
02:27:30,349 --> 02:27:31,974
you played and grew up dear!

2835
02:27:33,474 --> 02:27:37,266
The calf will come towards the cow,
is the reason why I was quiet...

2836
02:27:37,891 --> 02:27:38,557
Come daughter,

2837
02:27:38,891 --> 02:27:39,891
come child,

2838
02:27:40,141 --> 02:27:41,557
it is I, I am your mother!

2839
02:27:43,307 --> 02:27:45,849
Who is the poet who wrote
The drama of this world...

2840
02:27:46,182 --> 02:27:49,349
Who is the poet who wrote
The drama of this world...

2841
02:27:49,516 --> 02:27:51,932
With life attached emotions...

2842
02:27:52,224 --> 02:27:54,224
With grief attached
to happiness!

2843
02:27:54,224 --> 02:27:55,224
With grief attached to happiness!
Just shut up!

2844
02:27:56,891 --> 02:27:58,474
Bharatha please send them away,

2845
02:27:58,641 --> 02:27:59,891
I'm really getting irritated.

2846
02:28:00,349 --> 02:28:01,766
I'm not ready to
get cheated again.

2847
02:28:02,557 --> 02:28:03,724
We are amateur actors,

2848
02:28:03,724 --> 02:28:04,307
you saw through us easily

2849
02:28:04,307 --> 02:28:05,182
These are theatre artists,

2850
02:28:05,266 --> 02:28:06,307
impossible to see through!

2851
02:28:06,641 --> 02:28:07,182
Look here,

2852
02:28:07,557 --> 02:28:09,307
just check if our
blood group matches,

2853
02:28:09,599 --> 02:28:10,849
I have got the blood sample.

2854
02:28:11,391 --> 02:28:13,307
So you have come fully prepared?

2855
02:28:13,349 --> 02:28:13,849
Sir...

2856
02:28:14,182 --> 02:28:15,516
It's not the blood
that needs to match,

2857
02:28:15,682 --> 02:28:16,349
it's the heart.

2858
02:28:17,432 --> 02:28:18,766
You please make them go!

2859
02:28:18,891 --> 02:28:20,016
You please make them go!

2860
02:28:21,057 --> 02:28:21,724
Did you see Shri,

2861
02:28:22,016 --> 02:28:23,182
you came looking for
one set of parents

2862
02:28:23,182 --> 02:28:24,557
and now you found
hundreds of them.

2863
02:28:24,807 --> 02:28:26,307
I think that's why you
are glowing so much!

2864
02:28:26,682 --> 02:28:27,224
Mother,

2865
02:28:27,599 --> 02:28:28,057
mother,

2866
02:28:28,599 --> 02:28:28,974
mother,

2867
02:28:29,141 --> 02:28:29,766
mother!

2868
02:28:29,974 --> 02:28:31,057
All this while you were
calling her daughter, daughter

2869
02:28:31,057 --> 02:28:32,182
and now its mother, I believe!
Go and stand there!

2870
02:28:32,391 --> 02:28:33,099
Come here...

2871
02:28:33,141 --> 02:28:34,807
There are snacks and
sweets ready for all.

2872
02:28:35,182 --> 02:28:36,432
It's a buffet system. Enjoy!

2873
02:28:37,057 --> 02:28:37,974
Is there alcohol?

2874
02:28:38,557 --> 02:28:39,349
Yes, there is that too!

2875
02:28:39,849 --> 02:28:42,516
Just eat the snacks that
are ready and just go home!

2876
02:28:46,932 --> 02:28:50,682
She came from abroad looking for
her parents but what Shri found was

2877
02:28:50,807 --> 02:28:52,349
hundreds of guardians!

2878
02:28:52,849 --> 02:28:55,099
Shri is now confused
and bankrupt!

2879
02:29:42,641 --> 02:29:44,516
I don't think I'll ever
find my family Bharatha.

2880
02:29:46,182 --> 02:29:46,849
I'll go back!

2881
02:29:47,474 --> 02:29:48,182
Sorry Shri,

2882
02:29:49,057 --> 02:29:50,432
If you wait for a few more days,
we could have searched for them.

2883
02:29:50,766 --> 02:29:51,432
Leave it...

2884
02:29:51,807 --> 02:29:52,932
It's all my fate!

2885
02:29:58,557 --> 02:30:00,391
You wanted to say something!
Saying so, you brought me here...

2886
02:30:00,724 --> 02:30:01,349
What is it?

2887
02:30:01,682 --> 02:30:03,016
I don't know how you
will feel about it,

2888
02:30:03,224 --> 02:30:04,391
but I will give you my opinion.

2889
02:30:04,849 --> 02:30:06,724
Yesterday, so many came
claiming to be your parents.

2890
02:30:07,016 --> 02:30:08,016
What did you feel
when you saw them.

2891
02:30:08,432 --> 02:30:09,307
What do you think I'll feel?

2892
02:30:09,807 --> 02:30:11,224
Obviously, they are frauds!

2893
02:30:11,724 --> 02:30:14,224
There come to play on a child's
emotions for her parents.

2894
02:30:14,724 --> 02:30:15,766
I really feel bad!

2895
02:30:16,849 --> 02:30:18,057
The kind of people
in this world.

2896
02:30:18,641 --> 02:30:19,516
They are not frauds Shri...

2897
02:30:20,349 --> 02:30:20,891
They are helpless.

2898
02:30:22,891 --> 02:30:23,557
Without any means!

2899
02:30:24,224 --> 02:30:25,891
They have come to you looking
for your help, that's all.

2900
02:30:26,224 --> 02:30:28,016
But in your eyes they
look like frauds.

2901
02:30:29,349 --> 02:30:31,766
In our country no one cares
for the elderly Shri...

2902
02:30:32,349 --> 02:30:34,599
The maximum that they do is that
in the city bus or the Metro

2903
02:30:34,724 --> 02:30:35,474
they will give up their
seats, that's it.

2904
02:30:37,766 --> 02:30:39,641
Abroad when the children come of age
the children leave their parents,

2905
02:30:40,016 --> 02:30:40,766
but in our country

2906
02:30:41,057 --> 02:30:42,391
they leave their parents
after they become old.

2907
02:30:42,766 --> 02:30:43,557
If this is the
plight in the cities

2908
02:30:43,974 --> 02:30:45,057
what do you think
happens in the villages.

2909
02:30:45,849 --> 02:30:47,724
Once they get old,
since there is no to take care of them

2910
02:30:48,057 --> 02:30:49,849
God knows how so many
have died a lonely death!

2911
02:30:51,349 --> 02:30:52,516
If you make up your mind,

2912
02:30:52,641 --> 02:30:53,849
you can be a guardian
for all of them.

2913
02:30:56,724 --> 02:30:58,516
What Baahubali said
might sound funny

2914
02:30:58,724 --> 02:30:59,557
but think about it seriously?

2915
02:31:01,557 --> 02:31:03,391
You came looking
for your parents

2916
02:31:03,599 --> 02:31:04,474
but what you found was

2917
02:31:04,724 --> 02:31:05,641
hundreds of guardians!

2918
02:31:07,224 --> 02:31:08,099
If you make up your mind,

2919
02:31:08,307 --> 02:31:09,391
you can show them
a daughter's love!

2920
02:31:10,974 --> 02:31:12,349
All that they are
expecting from you,

2921
02:31:12,432 --> 02:31:13,849
are shelter and
hope, that's all!

2922
02:31:41,474 --> 02:31:42,224
You are right Bharatha,

2923
02:31:43,599 --> 02:31:45,432
I didn't think about
it from that angle.

2924
02:31:46,391 --> 02:31:47,016
From today,

2925
02:31:47,266 --> 02:31:48,849
I will stop searching
for my parents,

2926
02:31:50,557 --> 02:31:53,474
I will treat all those who
came there as my own parents.

2927
02:31:54,224 --> 02:31:56,016
I want all their love.

2928
02:31:56,474 --> 02:31:58,099
I will really do what I can.

2929
02:31:58,682 --> 02:31:59,766
Whatever their needs are,

2930
02:32:00,016 --> 02:32:00,974
I will arrange for it.

2931
02:32:02,599 --> 02:32:03,557
After I am gone,

2932
02:32:03,641 --> 02:32:05,432
the responsibility to
look after them well

2933
02:32:05,474 --> 02:32:06,474
will be yours and Baahubali's!

2934
02:32:06,849 --> 02:32:07,724
And one more thing,

2935
02:32:08,016 --> 02:32:08,932
for their maintenance

2936
02:32:08,974 --> 02:32:11,307
every month money will keep
getting deposited in your account.

2937
02:32:11,849 --> 02:32:13,599
But no cheating this
time, all right?

2938
02:32:14,807 --> 02:32:15,599
When will you be back Shri?

2939
02:32:15,932 --> 02:32:16,599
For your wedding.

2940
02:32:16,724 --> 02:32:17,349
Wedding!

2941
02:32:18,432 --> 02:32:20,099
Why are you laughing?
I'm serious!

2942
02:32:20,682 --> 02:32:22,432
No more responsibility
of looking for my parents

2943
02:32:22,599 --> 02:32:23,932
from now,
start looking for a girlfriend.

2944
02:32:24,307 --> 02:32:25,099
I already have found one.

2945
02:32:25,599 --> 02:32:26,349
Really?

2946
02:32:26,766 --> 02:32:27,807
I want to see the picture,

2947
02:32:27,849 --> 02:32:28,557
show me!

2948
02:32:29,557 --> 02:32:30,766
There is no photo,

2949
02:32:31,016 --> 02:32:31,516
she is in my heart.

2950
02:32:32,224 --> 02:32:32,974
It's one way man.

2951
02:32:33,599 --> 02:32:34,557
Come on Bharatha,

2952
02:32:34,807 --> 02:32:37,099
you have managed to find fake
parents for me and convinced me,

2953
02:32:37,391 --> 02:32:39,141
is it difficult for
you to convince a girl?

2954
02:32:39,474 --> 02:32:39,849
Come on,

2955
02:32:40,099 --> 02:32:40,974
talk to her...

2956
02:32:41,266 --> 02:32:42,474
I want to speak to her...

2957
02:32:42,516 --> 02:32:43,057
Call her...

2958
02:32:50,516 --> 02:32:51,141
One second.

2959
02:32:55,432 --> 02:32:55,724
Hello!

2960
02:32:56,224 --> 02:32:56,641
Hi!

2961
02:32:56,849 --> 02:32:57,474
Shri here..

2962
02:32:58,057 --> 02:32:58,724
Hi Shri,

2963
02:32:59,016 --> 02:32:59,932
this is Peter...

2964
02:33:00,474 --> 02:33:01,307
Peter?

2965
02:33:11,432 --> 02:33:12,016
Peter?

2966
02:33:16,391 --> 02:33:16,807
Peter

2967
02:33:17,224 --> 02:33:18,016
I thought you have gone,

2968
02:33:18,349 --> 02:33:18,891
you are here!

2969
02:33:19,224 --> 02:33:21,057
That's why you were always
with my girlfriend, right?

2970
02:33:21,641 --> 02:33:22,516
I will kill you!

2971
02:33:24,182 --> 02:33:26,057
Stand straight first and
then you can kill me!

2972
02:33:27,307 --> 02:33:28,099
What's your problem?

2973
02:33:28,641 --> 02:33:29,599
You are my problem,

2974
02:33:30,474 --> 02:33:31,974
she used to love me a lot,

2975
02:33:32,349 --> 02:33:33,349
but you guys...

2976
02:33:33,766 --> 02:33:34,599
You made her dumb!

2977
02:33:40,182 --> 02:33:41,599
Please don't take her away!

2978
02:33:42,391 --> 02:33:43,641
I will die without her!

2979
02:33:44,682 --> 02:33:46,141
Leave her, please...

2980
02:33:46,516 --> 02:33:47,641
She's mine!

2981
02:33:48,224 --> 02:33:48,849
Leave her,

2982
02:33:49,599 --> 02:33:50,474
She's mine!

2983
02:33:50,516 --> 02:33:51,849
Please leave her,

2984
02:33:52,599 --> 02:33:53,349
Leave her,

2985
02:33:57,766 --> 02:33:58,682
You have come,

2986
02:33:59,349 --> 02:34:00,599
couldn't you have
come a little earlier?

2987
02:34:01,266 --> 02:34:02,766
After I built my dreams,

2988
02:34:03,057 --> 02:34:04,391
to destroy them, you bugger!

2989
02:34:07,474 --> 02:34:08,932
Letting go is not
something new to us.

2990
02:34:09,807 --> 02:34:11,349
Who am I to let go of her.

2991
02:34:13,391 --> 02:34:14,266
See Peter,

2992
02:34:14,891 --> 02:34:16,432
Indians know only to give,

2993
02:34:16,932 --> 02:34:18,016
they know only to give!

2994
02:34:18,682 --> 02:34:19,349
They don't know

2995
02:34:19,849 --> 02:34:20,432
to snatch.

2996
02:34:26,682 --> 02:34:27,307
Peter,

2997
02:34:27,516 --> 02:34:28,182
where are you?

2998
02:34:28,307 --> 02:34:29,557
I am very sorry Shri,

2999
02:34:30,307 --> 02:34:31,807
I didn't understand
your feelings...

3000
02:34:33,349 --> 02:34:34,849
And I know I hurt you very bad!

3001
02:34:35,557 --> 02:34:36,432
I'm so sorry!

3002
02:34:36,599 --> 02:34:38,307
Leave all that,
where are you Peter?

3003
02:34:40,391 --> 02:34:40,807
Turn around!

3004
02:34:42,474 --> 02:34:43,266
Peter?

3005
02:34:43,599 --> 02:34:44,432
Hi,

3006
02:34:44,682 --> 02:34:46,307
Oh! My God!

3007
02:34:52,891 --> 02:34:54,557
I love you...

3008
02:34:54,724 --> 02:34:55,849
I love you too!

3009
02:35:08,557 --> 02:35:10,057
In my eyes,

3010
02:35:11,391 --> 02:35:13,057
in my eyes...

3011
02:35:14,307 --> 02:35:18,974
I loved you when I
set my eyes on you...

3012
02:35:19,432 --> 02:35:21,057
In my heart,

3013
02:35:22,057 --> 02:35:23,891
in my heart...

3014
02:35:24,974 --> 02:35:30,016
I worshipped you, from far...

3015
02:35:46,682 --> 02:35:47,141
Peter...

3016
02:35:48,766 --> 02:35:50,349
This is what an Indian's
emotions is all about,

3017
02:35:50,641 --> 02:35:51,682
it's all in the heart!

3018
02:35:53,599 --> 02:35:54,099
Yes,

3019
02:35:54,849 --> 02:35:56,224
even I want to be an Indian...

3020
02:35:56,682 --> 02:35:57,266
Look here...

3021
02:35:58,057 --> 02:35:58,474
OK!

3022
02:35:58,682 --> 02:35:59,307
Lord Hanuman...

3023
02:35:59,641 --> 02:36:00,766
Are you serious?

3024
02:36:00,849 --> 02:36:01,641
Lord Ganesha!

3025
02:36:02,516 --> 02:36:03,182
India is great!

3026
02:36:03,182 --> 02:36:04,724
I love you baby...

3027
02:36:55,724 --> 02:36:59,307
Mother, you are not...

3028
02:36:59,641 --> 02:37:03,391
Why then do you
shower this love?

3029
02:37:04,807 --> 02:37:08,391
Related, we are not...

3030
02:37:08,766 --> 02:37:12,349
Why then do you shower
this compassion?

3031
02:37:20,057 --> 02:37:20,724
Shri...

3032
02:37:21,724 --> 02:37:22,724
She is not our daughter.

3033
02:37:24,432 --> 02:37:29,141
Still, she is looking after us
better than our own daughter!

3034
02:37:29,516 --> 02:37:30,932
Hoping for shelter,

3035
02:37:31,391 --> 02:37:32,391
we lied and came here!

3036
02:37:33,807 --> 02:37:34,599
Sir,

3037
02:37:35,266 --> 02:37:37,974
she is well aware that none
among you here are her parents.

3038
02:37:39,432 --> 02:37:41,057
We are also among those
who tried to cheat her,

3039
02:37:42,016 --> 02:37:43,766
but she brought about
a change in us too.

3040
02:37:44,391 --> 02:37:46,182
The same change is
seen in you too.

3041
02:37:46,891 --> 02:37:48,474
What is greater than
remorse, tell me?

3042
02:37:49,807 --> 02:37:50,724
If you leave now,

3043
02:37:50,849 --> 02:37:52,141
she will get hurt
her very badly.

3044
02:37:52,682 --> 02:37:54,474
If you are keen on
hurting her feelings

3045
02:37:54,682 --> 02:37:55,599
then you can leave.

3046
02:37:59,266 --> 02:38:00,474
Come, let's stay here, come!

3047
02:38:00,474 --> 02:38:02,974
Seven births too
will fall short...

3048
02:38:03,099 --> 02:38:05,266
To repay these deeds of yours!

3049
02:38:05,474 --> 02:38:08,766
You are the Goddess Mother!

3050
02:38:12,099 --> 02:38:13,974
This was the picture
taken at the fair.

3051
02:38:14,224 --> 02:38:15,557
If we show her this

3052
02:38:15,641 --> 02:38:16,641
and tell her she's our daughter,

3053
02:38:16,641 --> 02:38:17,641
she will believe us,

3054
02:38:18,016 --> 02:38:19,682
but why are you not
letting me do that?

3055
02:38:20,516 --> 02:38:22,057
Don't we have
everything we need here?

3056
02:38:22,849 --> 02:38:25,141
She doesn't know who
her real parents are,

3057
02:38:26,641 --> 02:38:28,266
so she considers everyone here

3058
02:38:29,057 --> 02:38:31,724
as her parents and is looking
after everyone with love.

3059
02:38:33,141 --> 02:38:34,349
If she gets to
know who they are,

3060
02:38:34,682 --> 02:38:37,724
in her heart, selfishness that
is in his nature will be born!

3061
02:38:38,099 --> 02:38:40,766
All the love she has will die
and basic humanity will diminish

3062
02:38:40,932 --> 02:38:43,016
this facility that provides
shelter to many will close down.

3063
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:46,807
She will definitely take us home with
her, that's fine...

3064
02:38:47,016 --> 02:38:48,432
But what about the people here?

3065
02:38:48,682 --> 02:38:50,724
All here will again be homeless!

3066
02:38:54,391 --> 02:38:57,474
We couldn't give
anything back to society

3067
02:38:58,266 --> 02:39:01,016
but our daughter is
doing a good work.

3068
02:39:01,682 --> 02:39:03,682
Due to our selfishness
let it not get spoiled!

3069
02:39:04,932 --> 02:39:06,141
After we lost her...

3070
02:39:06,849 --> 02:39:09,307
All that pain and suffering
we have endured in our heart

3071
02:39:09,307 --> 02:39:10,891
and we have survived
for so many days, right?

3072
02:39:11,182 --> 02:39:12,182
Even if we had not found her,

3073
02:39:12,557 --> 02:39:13,682
we would have still
survived, right?

3074
02:39:15,432 --> 02:39:16,724
Let's continue to
live like that!

3075
02:39:19,432 --> 02:39:22,141
Whatever be our race or religion

3076
02:39:22,141 --> 02:39:24,516
The same emotion you exhibit...

3077
02:39:24,641 --> 02:39:28,224
It can only be
you, Mother India!

3078
02:39:28,557 --> 02:39:30,807
It was cold this morning right?
It is so nice!

3079
02:39:31,432 --> 02:39:33,849
Hi, good morning!

3080
02:39:34,307 --> 02:39:35,682
There's a surprise
for all of you today!

3081
02:39:35,807 --> 02:39:36,932
Surprise? What is it?

3082
02:39:37,016 --> 02:39:37,391
What is it?

3083
02:39:37,391 --> 02:39:38,932
For breakfast with you today,

3084
02:39:39,391 --> 02:39:40,307
do you know who is coming?

3085
02:39:40,432 --> 02:39:41,224
Who? Who?

3086
02:39:41,682 --> 02:39:42,391
Shri is coming...

3087
02:39:44,307 --> 02:39:44,932
Where? Where?

3088
02:39:44,974 --> 02:39:45,682
Where? Where?

3089
02:39:45,766 --> 02:39:46,391
Connect it dude...

3090
02:39:48,266 --> 02:39:49,557
Hi mom, hi dad!

3091
02:39:49,641 --> 02:39:50,849
Hi! Hi! My daughter...

3092
02:39:51,057 --> 02:39:51,557
Fine

3093
02:39:52,307 --> 02:39:52,932
How are you all?

3094
02:39:52,932 --> 02:39:54,807
Fine! Fine! Fine!

3095
02:39:55,057 --> 02:39:55,807
Hi Bharatha...

3096
02:39:56,266 --> 02:39:56,807
Hi Shri...

3097
02:39:57,391 --> 02:39:58,557
What's for breakfast today?

3098
02:39:59,182 --> 02:40:00,391
Hi ma'am, good morning.

3099
02:40:00,724 --> 02:40:02,307

02:40:02,307 --> 02:40:03,016

Chow chow bath, Wow!

Uthappa!

Okay enough, that's it!

3113
02:40:15,266 --> 02:40:17,099
I miss Indian food so much!

3114
02:40:17,349 --> 02:40:20,266
For the amount of food you are giving
everyone is put on a little weight.

3115
02:40:21,599 --> 02:40:22,766
So when are you
coming back Shri?

3116
02:40:23,057 --> 02:40:24,349
I am coming soon, very soon.

3117
02:40:25,016 --> 02:40:26,349
Look after your health well,

3118
02:40:26,391 --> 02:40:28,016
all of you take your
medicines on time!

3119
02:40:28,349 --> 02:40:29,807
Take care... OK?

3120
02:40:29,974 --> 02:40:30,391
Bye!

3121
02:40:31,141 --> 02:40:31,349
Bye!

3122
02:40:31,516 --> 02:40:32,349
Bye ma'am!

3123
02:40:32,557 --> 02:40:36,057
Words are not needed,

3124
02:40:36,391 --> 02:40:40,307
If silence is not understood...

3125
02:40:43,807 --> 02:40:47,557
Love does not dies,

3126
02:40:47,724 --> 02:40:51,474
If the heart does not break!

3127
02:40:52,307 --> 02:40:55,057
Even after seven births

3128
02:40:55,182 --> 02:40:57,349
My love will not die...

3129
02:40:57,432 --> 02:41:00,682
It's you,
who are my eternal consort!

3130
02:41:01,307 --> 02:41:04,141

to me a hundred times,

02:41:04,224 --> 02:41:06,432
Again and again,
I will keep waiting!

3132
02:41:06,474 --> 02:41:10,682
You are my eternal lady love!
