1
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,217
Sir!

2
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,453
Greetings

3
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,585
Samson?

4
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,959
Oh! You are being
released today

5
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,225
Don't tease

6
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,735
God doesn't create everyone
as sinless as you, sir

7
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,403
l was waiting for 2 hours
to see you and bid goodbye

8
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,532
Of course, l wouldn't have
left without seeing you

9
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,874
My wife's birthday
So we all went to a temple

10
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,277
The littlejoys
of a family life, dude

11
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,440
That's why l was late

12
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:13,474
Sir, l am totally disturbed
Very stressed from morning

13
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,384
Why? You should be happy
and celebrating the day

14
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,956
Happiness is not
for people like us

15
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,458
When l was released today
those fellows wailed in misery

16
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,256
They cried as if l was being
driven out of my own home

17
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,660
This is my home

18
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,361
l'll soon come back here

19
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,730
We must give you
a good treat on retirement

20
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,530
You don't have to come back

21
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,595
People brag that going
to jail as a sign of manliness

22
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:38,769
Frankly, manliness l'd say was
in living a dignified family life

23
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,843
l'm not destined for
marriage and family

24
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,313
l already have 1 foot in the grave

25
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,748
All that will happen some day

26
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,785
lt's not ordained
for men like me

27
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,285
Shouldn't l find someone
to match my job and status?

28
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,687
To match your status?

29
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,817
That won't be difficult at all!

30
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,578
Was she also in ourjail?

31
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,347
Of course, why?

32
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:24,717
lf men and women convicts
were notjailed separately...

33
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:29,455
...we'd be 1 happy family
sharing all the chores

34
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,328
We'd have time then
only to deliver babies!

35
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,264
Carry on, God bless you

36
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,529
God bless you also

37
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,884
Has no one come
to take you home?

38
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,458
No one's come for me also

39
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,816
Money, what l toiled
and earned in jail

40
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,721
Have you any idea
what money is worth these days?

41
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,590
Shall we get to
know each other?.

42
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,632
Sorry! Sorry!
Forget l said anything!

43
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,868
Aiyo!

44
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,772
Look what he's done!
Are you hurt?

45
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,285
Bring that vehicle here

46
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,695
Are you with the lady
who met with the accident?

47
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,499
Get us the admit-slip

48
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,640
l want an admit-slip

49
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,867
What is her name?

50
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,445
Name...?

51
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,905
Tell me her name, mister

52
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,038
Marykutty

53
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:04,976
Age?

54
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:11,523
Age...35...no 30

55
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:12,784
No, make it 29

56
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:14,623
Address?

57
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:15,625
ls it compulsory?

58
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,320
Yes

59
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,297
House in jail premises
Central jail PO, Kannur

60
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,470
lf this slip costs Rs 100...

61
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,971
...what will it cost
aftertreatment!?

62
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,939
We'll tell you that
after the treatment

63
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,338
You must, alright?

64
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,607
Where are you taking her?

65
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,480
She needs a scan
You also must be there, come

66
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,790
- ls she conscious?
- Not yet

67
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,658
- What's wrong, nurse?
- Nothing to worry

68
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,627
- Nothing to worry
- Plenty to worry

69
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,360
- What?
- The Sub-inspector wants to see you

70
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:56,901
Come with me

71
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,771
What is your name?

72
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,777
Samson (Samsung)

73
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,373
lsn't that a TV (brand)?

74
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,849
That is Samsung
l am Samson

75
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,417
Do you know this woman
who was knocked down?

76
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,285
- l don't know
- What do you know then?

77
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,946
l only know she's just
been released from jail

78
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,390
How do you know that?

79
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,825
Because l too
got out from there!

80
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,896
So both of you are
very well mannered, eh?

81
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,594
Not very
May be a little

82
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,835
What have you
flicked from her?

83
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,465
Me? Don't utter such words

84
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,975
l can't bear to hear the word 'rob'

85
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:38,874
lsn't it wrong?

86
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,912
Of course!
Terribly wrong!

87
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,004
Search him

88
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,879
l took this bag
since no one else was there

89
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:45,781
Look inside the bag

90
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,876
Don't mess with my dhoti
lt will come off

91
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,683
l tell you!
Dhoti will come off!!

92
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,813
My dear sir...

93
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,289
My clothes
The only ones l have

94
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,724
Don't touch that
Hard earned money in jail

95
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,628
- Let go
- Stand still, dude

96
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,393
Not my pocket
My mobile

97
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,527
Sir...!
My hand...

98
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,785
Looks quite good, dude!

99
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,554
Unearthly beauty
With a smiling face

100
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,016
Who is she?

101
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,523
The accident victim, sir

102
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,858
Why do you have this?

103
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,922
lf she died l could put it
in the obituary column!

104
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,434
Oh what foresightedness!
Did you make a pass at her?

105
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,594
She got knocked down
before l could!!

106
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:38,670
So she's alive

107
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:39,669
l expect her to be

108
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,501
So you have expectations, eh?

109
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,972
lsn't that what life is all about?

110
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,669
Aren't you Marykutty's attendant?

111
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,574
- ls she conscious now?
- Yes

112
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,837
Please get us these medicines

113
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,939
Will you buy them or should l?

114
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,716
You will!

115
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,082
Give me that photo!
Enough of staring at it

116
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,720
Edo!

117
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,489
Unearthly beauty

118
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:18,541
A random stranger out of the blue
You fill up my senses...true

119
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:24,378
Uncurbed, without walls you appear
ln my dreams, who are you, my dear?

120
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:30,046
How did this begin...our story
When and how is a mystery?!

121
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:35,885
Before l met you face to face
you captured in my heart a place

122
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,954
Are you the skylark humming
a song of honeyed sweetness?

123
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,428
The damsel whose eyes sparkle
like stars in shyness?

124
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,674
Are you the skylark humming
a song of honeyed sweetness?

125
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,677
The maiden whose eyes sparkle
like stars in shyness?

126
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:59,308
Coral jasmine blossoms anew
Beautiful girl...who are you?

127
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:05,419
A random stranger out of the blue
You fill up my senses...true

128
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:11,656
Unlimited, without walls you appear
ln my dreams, who are you, my dear?

129
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,410
Aiyaiyo!

130
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,884
Move aside

131
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:52,769
Your smile like sparklers of gold
Auspicious sight at dawn to behold?!

132
00:12:52,872 --> 00:13:03,840
Seen and unseen in my memory stream
ls this the face l saw in my dream?

133
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:09,786
Can love at first glance
grow into this love-ly romance?

134
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:15,691
Have we not met before...
some where...some time ago?

135
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:21,563
ln many a park's flowered lane
through births time and again

136
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,568
Are you the skylark humming
a song of honeyed sweetness?

137
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,468
The lady whose eyes sparkle
like stars in shyness?

138
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:32,875
Coral jasmine blossoms anew
Beautiful girl...who are you?

139
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:39,012
A random stranger out of the blue
You fill up my senses...true

140
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:45,387
Unrestrained, without walls you appear
ln my dreams, who are you, my dear?

141
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:17,084
Slumbering in my thoughts,
my parakeet near me!

142
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:23,355
Are you my mate
who sulks endearingly?!

143
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:29,063
Your words
like a shower of pearls fall

144
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:34,766
Are you that precious rain,
my pretty pal?!

145
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:40,676
Even the heart within a firefly
reaches out to be with stars high

146
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:46,479
Come, reach out to be with me
Will you be able to say no, truly?

147
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:52,285
Will your silence speak louder
all your words locked forever?

148
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,360
Are you the skylark humming
a song of honeyed sweetness?

149
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,089
The lass whose eyes sparkle
like stars in shyness?

150
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:03,734
Coral jasmine blossoms anew
Beautiful girl...who are you?

151
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:09,938
A random stranger out of the blue
You fill up my senses...true

152
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:16,437
Unbridled, without walls you appear
ln my dreams, who are you, my dear?

153
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:21,316
No

154
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,285
l will not answer
l am very angry

155
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,761
Answer it, man!

156
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,059
l don't care for one
who doesn't care for me

157
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,791
What did achayan (brother)
do for you to moan like this?

158
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,768
- Talk to him
- No!

159
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,671
- Talk
- Didn't l say 'no'?!

160
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,712
Brother, ever since your call
this morning, he's been crying

161
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,373
Drinking to forget his misery
l'm really fed up!

162
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,507
What's wrong with him?

163
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,311
Ask him to stop
making me miserable

164
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,011
He's my only friend

165
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,954
l got out ofjail
only to be with him

166
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,287
Pity, he refuses to understand me

167
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,657
Hello?

168
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,489
He disconnected

169
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,023
When he met a fair skinned gal
he just forgot me

170
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,831
l've waited here day
and night for him to come

171
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:12,871
Now look what's happened?

172
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,769
Sure, day and night
you've wallowed in brandy

173
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:18,001
Don't provoke me
anymore, you drunkard!

174
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,488
No...no...don't get up

175
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,857
That vehicle didn't stop
after knocking you down

176
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,695
But l can recognize it
Tamil Nadu registration

00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,064
Police have registered a case

178
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,963
l am Samson
Back home, l'm Samkutty

179
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:52,305
3 years l also was inside
Attempted murder, section 307

180
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,844
l argued the case
on behalf of myself

181
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,847
People say l've now
become a good lawyer

182
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,780
Easy, don't strain your head

183
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,112
Scan report says
everything is okay

184
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,886
All is well
Except forthis injury

185
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,321
l was relieved
when l heard that

186
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,382
Lucky you didn't die

187
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,552
Give me a number
where l can contact yourfamily

188
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,754
lf someone comes
l'll feel relieved

189
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,061
98...

190
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,832
Who shall l say is calling?

191
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,641
Mallika

192
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,846
When you were admitted
l named you Marykutty

193
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,416
Someone l know!

194
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,782
Women are like gum

195
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,822
lf they stick to your mind
very difficult to tearthem out

196
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:42,290
lt says this is not in use
ls there any other number?.

197
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,887
- No
- Where is your home?

198
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:51,528
Karippa, very far off
Near Kodagu

199
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:56,603
So it's impossible to go
and bring someone

200
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,106
l'll get you something to eat

201
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:10,982
What is it, nurse?

202
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:14,025
Pay Rs 20000 at the counter
and collect the bill and receipt

203
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,560
Rs 20000?

204
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,027
Yes, MRl itself costs Rs 12000

205
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,031
Treatment only after
the bill is cleared

206
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,464
What'll l do
if you say such things?

207
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,297
This is the only way
l know to talk!!

208
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,894
This is not a charitable hospital

209
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,304
Speak respectfully

210
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,774
A cap and white frock
will not make you a nurse

211
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,937
Your heart needs
some vital items in it

212
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:37,015
Pity, love, sympathy
truth, humanity

213
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,413
What's happening?

214
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,984
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

215
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,077
- l am the doctor
- l am the patient's attendant

216
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,343
What's the issue, nurse?

217
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,083
He's creating a ruckus
when asked to pay the bill

218
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,654
How can we pay the bill?

219
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,520
How am l sure
your treatment will cure?

220
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,426
We don't know
anything about it

221
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,727
Neither do we know
if you know

222
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,528
So 1st treatment
Then l'll pay

223
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,000
That's fair enough!

224
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,970
Whatever you say
the bill has to be paid

225
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:04,872
Doctor, if your wife
met with an accident...

226
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,310
...will you take her to
the nearest hospital or the bank?

227
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,880
That's fair enough!

228
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,383
l won't get money until
the bank opens tomorrow

229
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,818
Let the patient remain here
Discharge her after l pay

230
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,549
- lsn't that fair?
- Of course!

231
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,886
Doctor, come this way

232
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,324
This is tricky
Better be discreet

233
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,760
lf newspapers come to know
we'll be the ones put to shame

234
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,320
Doctor, you go

235
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:34,395
Sir, as soon as the bank
opens tomorrow, pay the bill

236
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,404
Problem solved?

237
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,874
Yes and address me
with respect like this

238
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:41,379
lf you don't give her
the right treatment...

239
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,437
...l won't treat you
as a doctor!

240
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,312
l am not a doctor
l'm a sister (nurse)

241
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,648
All sisters are not
sisters to me, sister!

242
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,420
l am like that

243
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,482
A few strong dialogs
and they'll fall flat!

244
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,358
He called me 'sir right away

245
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,521
lmagine! Me? Sir?

246
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,930
But tomorrow our words
will boomerang on us!

247
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,096
Before we get hit
we must either pay or...

248
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:12,599
l may have only
about Rs 5000

249
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:16,945
lf l add mine, it still
won't add up to Rs 20000

250
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,349
l can only think
of a crooked way out

251
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:26,685
lf you have the guts
we'll just disappear at dawn

252
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,684
l'll be waiting outside

253
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,061
Anyone asks tell them
you are stepping out to drink tea

254
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,825
l'll take care of the rest

255
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,962
- Kesav'eta, take your tea
- Okay

256
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,519
Have you taken your medicine?

257
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,662
Take your pills promptly

258
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,357
l've written my phone number
and put it inside your bag

259
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,400
Give me a call
as soon as you reach

260
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,698
l don't think l'll make it alone

261
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,939
lf you are not in a rush
will you...?

262
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,771
That's fine
Give me that bag

263
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,835
l just have a brief stop
at Dasan's house

264
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,642
He was with me in jail

265
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,411
Good fellow
His wife is pregnant

266
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,510
l must hand over
some money and a few letters

267
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,781
lt won't take long

268
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:34,488
After 5 years in jail,
reaching home 1 day later...

269
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:40,759
...will hardly make a difference!

270
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,595
Was it murder?

271
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,131
Yes

272
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:10,888
Go ahead, sleep

273
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,896
No, l slept well

274
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,535
l'm such a nuisance to you, right?

275
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:24,638
People we care for
can't become a nuisance

276
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,844
lt only gives happiness

277
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,080
What was yourjob?

278
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:34,815
Stealing and small jobs
of a hit-man on hire

279
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:39,615
Like birds in the sky
we neither sow nor reap

280
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,750
Nor do we save up
wealth in lockers

281
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,955
lnstead steal another's
savings and live happily

282
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,431
That's what
my horoscope predicts too!

283
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,022
The 12th lunar asterism
Regulus, Aries

284
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,402
l can't exist without stealing

285
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,765
Neither do l want to
contradict my horoscope

286
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:58,707
But this time, l wasn't
imprisoned fortheft

287
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:05,849
At Cheruvathur, my home town
l was on my way on work

288
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,544
l was walking
along the railway track

289
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,457
Oh God!
lsn't this Paul'aetta?

290
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,760
What's wrong?
Why are you lying here?

291
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,458
Leave me alone

292
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,729
lsn't it Marykutty's
wedding next week?

293
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:25,827
That will not happen

294
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,098
Why?

295
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:31,840
Anjirikal Jose promised
to get me the gold for the wedding

296
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,810
He agreed to be paid
after the wedding

297
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,774
But now he has
gone back on his word

298
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,647
Says he'll give the gold
only if l pay him

299
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,019
l am in a real fix

300
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,581
l have no options left, Samkutty

301
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,418
Go away

302
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,727
l've decided what to do

303
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,655
Will her marriage
take place if you died?

304
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,698
lt won't

305
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,063
Moreover, she'll only cry
the rest of her life

306
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,835
Like a gift from her father

307
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,596
lntending to die it seems!

308
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,733
Are you prepared to get her
married with stolen wealth?

309
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,402
l'll get you the gold
No one will ever know

310
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,707
Let's go
Wedding will happen

311
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:19,080
lt's the same name, Marykutty
l wrote in the admit-slip

312
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:22,652
l was always behind her
Often cycling for miles

313
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:26,720
Probably due to my reputation
she never looked at me even once!

314
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,729
But that didn't stop my yearning

315
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,530
One day l was drunk
and crawling on all fours

316
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,070
And there stood Paul'ettan
right in front of me

317
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:37,532
l just blurted out that
l wanted to marry his daughter

318
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:41,773
He sensibly gave me
a good dose of profanities

319
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,940
That did it!
My head cleared

320
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:48,111
And it cured me of my desire!
Look at the Lord's comedy

321
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,978
He made sure l myself
got her married to another man!

322
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,961
So l set out to get her married
with full pomp and glory

323
00:24:57,028 --> 00:25:00,088
l got into a house
the next night to burgle

324
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,940
Come here, my sweetie
Let me tell you something

325
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,671
- Come to me, woman
- Leave me alone, sir

326
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,736
No, l will not

327
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,881
- This is not my kind of life
- Neither is it mine

328
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,010
-Aren't you my sugar-candy?
- Oh! l feel shy!

329
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,679
You...shy?!

330
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:26,155
Your 'sleeping beauty'
is in the bedroom

331
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,757
Let her sleep well
lf not, she'll lose her glamor

332
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:33,490
May be that's why
she's not conceiving!

333
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,522
Let me go

334
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,124
So no kids here!

335
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,936
l must go to Trivandrum
for a case early tomorrow

336
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,997
You waste time like this
and it'll soon be morning

337
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,538
- Come here
- Oh you are incorrigible!

338
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,959
He plays his dice for fortune,
for he's a gambler

339
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,733
He knows where to find his loot,
the perfect robber

340
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:17,104
He knows where to step in
and where not to pilfer

341
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,536
The robber... the prowler!

342
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,545
Shows in many ways than one,
his expertise

343
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:25,047
Makes his moves with calculated ease

344
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,584
Our clever housebreaker,
his deeds are elephantine

345
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,018
Oh yes! Oh indeed!

346
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,057
Without awakening a single soul

347
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,820
Or none suspecting his intentions, foul

348
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,418
Searches out valuables,
wipes them out clean

349
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:41,056
He is the fearless cat burglar,
crafty and sleek!

350
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,734
Oh yes! Oh indeed!

351
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,725
He plays his dice for fortune,
for he's a gambler

352
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,495
He knows where to find his loot,
the perfect robber

353
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,764
He knows where to step in
and where not to pilfer

354
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,432
The robber... the prowler!

355
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,107
Shows in many ways than one,
his expertise

356
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,838
Makes his moves with calculated ease

357
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,107
Our clever housebreaker,
his deeds are elephantine

358
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,911
Oh yes! Oh indeed!

359
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,813
Or none suspecting his intentions, foul

360
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,480
Searches out valuables,
wipes them out clean

361
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:41,047
He is the fearless cat burglar,
crafty and sleek!

362
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:05,645
Take it
l haven't weighed the gold

363
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:09,681
For her bridal wear and
money for other expenses

364
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,420
Don't tell her how
or where l got it

365
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:13,988
She'll feel bad if she knows

366
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,024
Go ahead with the wedding

367
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,821
- Samkutty...
- Don't say anything

368
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,453
Go and do
what has to be done

369
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,836
Pour me a strong one

370
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,012
l'm very tired
after last night's job

371
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,048
- So you don't need soda, eh?
- No, l don't

372
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,425
Brother, vehicle is here
to take you

373
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,618
What can they do?
l don't have any evidence on me

374
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,163
No evidence?
Then it's okay

375
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,865
There is 1 remaining

376
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,558
- Where?
- Here!!

377
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:57,430
Goodness!

378
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:58,760
Let me change

379
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,964
Go! You are not
destined to wear good briefs!

380
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,378
AiyO!

381
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:16,715
Where is Samson?

382
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:17,880
He'll be right back, sir

383
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,924
Gone...

384
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:22,424
You vagabond
showing me your finger, eh?

385
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,486
lt's a sign to show
he went out to pee, sir!

386
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,129
What happened, dude?

387
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,490
Sir, let him go
What are you doing?

388
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,529
l'll explain
Let's go first

389
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:32,728
Where to?

390
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,096
Kochapi, what is he saying?

391
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,800
He has the right
to say whatever

392
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:37,637
What happened?

393
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,700
'Finger chips'
He made itjust now

394
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,938
What is this, sir?.

395
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,570
You better come
to the jeep by yourself

396
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,445
Oh, l've been in plenty ofjeeps

397
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,950
Now tell me the issue
without threats

398
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,951
Where did you
get in last night?

399
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,749
He was with me last night
l swear!

400
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,656
Whenever he burgles, does he
sleep between you and your wife?

401
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,160
Don't harass him
What do you want from me?

402
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:02,992
Where's the 75 sovereigns of gold
you stole from Soman's house?

403
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,468
What? Who is Soman?

404
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,093
Who knows!

405
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,501
What are you saying, sir?

406
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,797
- ls it that fatso?
- May be

407
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,899
Was there so much
gold in his house?

408
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:16,106
Sir, don't saddle me
with someone else's crime!

409
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:20,150
lf l'd stolen it l'd admit it
l can't be father to anothers kid!

410
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:23,119
You can leave, sir
Solomon, get me a pint

411
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,122
- Tusker brand please
- You won't admit, eh?

412
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,714
Take your hands off me, sir

413
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,919
- You dare brush my hand away?
- Don't touch my dhoti

414
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:30,892
What will you do?

415
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,953
- Do not catch my dhoti?!
- What the heck will you do?

416
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,760
- Leave it, l say
-And if l don't...?

417
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:35,798
You'll be in trouble

418
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,562
lf you don't get into the jeep
you'll be in bigger trouble

419
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,431
No, l will not

420
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:39,798
- What?
- You won't, eh?

421
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,839
Catch him and
put him into the jeep

422
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,944
Don't throw him over my table!

423
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,454
l only broke Johnny sir's hand

424
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,957
But l was charged for
attempted murder, Section 307

425
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,889
l argued the case myself

426
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:06,157
So my punishment
was only for 3 years

427
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,092
With a parole in between

428
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:12,993
There's nothing to cry
l laugh when l think of it

429
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,901
My head's splitting!

430
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,439
Didn't you take your medicine?

431
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:20,875
l did, but the pain
is unbearable

432
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,674
Sir, is there a hospital nearby?

433
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:27,114
Sure, a Govt hospital
at Kacheripadi

434
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,777
Drive the bus
via that hospital

435
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,485
No, l'll surely come
l will come tomorrow

436
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,389
- Nurse, where is the doctor?.
- 1 minute

437
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,363
Do something
She's unable to bear the pain

438
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:41,932
Doctor will come
only after 4:00 PM

439
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,763
He's busy with
patients at his house

440
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:44,460
Where is his house?

441
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,025
Opposite the hospital
But don't go there

442
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,002
Doctor is very short tempered

443
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,936
So am l!

444
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,999
Just move aside, a little
l'll be right back

445
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:59,081
There's a medical shop outside
Go and buy it from there

446
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,014
Okay

447
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,484
Why only Rs 50?
My fee is Rs 100

448
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,824
l already paid
on my last visit

449
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,893
That was my fee
Not charity, right?

450
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,690
l don't have any more, doctor

451
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,822
Then don't come here any more

452
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,127
Go

453
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,124
Thangappan!

454
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,495
Doctor, please come
to the hospital right now

455
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,131
My duty starts
only after 4:00 PM

456
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,766
l'll come then
Now you go

457
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,572
Please don't be so hard hearted

458
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:29,374
We got off the bus
because she took ill

459
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,142
She's dying of headache
Doctor, you must come

460
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,942
lf she's dying take her
to some other hospital

461
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,486
Get out

462
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:40,055
- Now, will you come?
- Now, l'll come

463
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,148
Come

464
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:42,990
All of you come

465
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,585
Doctor will see you
only at the hospital

466
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:45,856
Are you Thangappan?

467
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,421
Then walk ahead and
rest of you file into a queue

468
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,162
Achaya (brother)

469
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,977
Sabu?

470
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,034
What are you doing here?

471
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,081
l'll tell you, but first ...
do you have a sword in the car?

472
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:06,946
- Yes
- Take it out

473
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,848
We are on our way back
after our game

474
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,045
'Chopping limbs' game

475
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,883
Doctor, please carry on

476
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,049
Go

477
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,187
Where are you coming from, bro?

478
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,054
From Kannur, where else?

479
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,923
Where did you find them?
They look quite scary

480
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,864
That's why l take them along
They are in great demand

481
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,130
Let me tell you something

482
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,027
l'll be back

483
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,538
- Who is he?
- Who knows!

484
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:41,008
Don't get up

485
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:44,577
He is Sabu, my close friend
He was at Kannurfor 2 1/2 months

486
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,385
He is the only one
alive in Kerala today

487
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,392
An expert who can
sever vital organs

488
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,121
l'm known as Chedathi Sabu

489
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:55,723
He may be puny but he's married
and that too, a love marriage

490
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,835
Met, got to know,
fell in love and got married

491
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:58,891
Everything in ajiffy

492
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,130
6 days that's all

493
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,999
6 days?
ls it possible?

494
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,132
Sure

495
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:07,968
You are terrific!

496
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,979
Both of you must visit me

497
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:13,380
She needs complete rest
Both of you go out

498
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:14,876
Okay

499
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,856
My dear brother
she's really a treasure

500
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,585
- Don't lose control, okay?!
- Don't be silly!

501
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:27,587
When we feel love, our actions
automatically become chivalrous

502
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:28,825
That's very true

503
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,992
Good omen!!

504
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,131
No, no need to cook
We'll bring everything

505
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:39,904
We'll be there in an hour
l'm on my way, my girl

506
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,172
Wife?

507
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,713
What is your
'quotation' for a leg?

508
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,614
lt's all piece rate now

509
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:56,989
A full leg is Rs 25000
To the knee Rs 20000

510
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,995
Only the heel is just 10000

511
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:01,597
Not enough
You have to hike your rates

512
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:06,000
Our place has higher rates
l was the 1st one to hike it

513
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,402
And if it is an emergency
we ask for more

514
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:12,204
Today we cut a politician's leg
when he was on his way to work

515
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,637
We charged 30000

516
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:17,680
Whichever political party
they all get a salary

517
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,409
Who's there to pay us?

518
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,920
So we must collect
our fee promptly

519
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,046
Sister?. He is a deep one

520
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,116
He's a man with many faces
He's a professor in jail

521
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,588
There'll be a class everyday

522
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:36,599
New ways to steal
New techniques to murder

523
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,464
Loop holes in FlR

00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,128
Police psychology

525
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,566
Ambiguities in law
Who do you think he is?!

526
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:49,537
Jailer Vasudevan depends on him
To clear his doubts

527
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:53,675
Please stop, Sabu
l don't like all this praise

528
00:35:53,751 --> 00:36:01,180
lf you talk good about me
people will think l set you up!

529
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:02,483
So don't do it

530
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,688
Please take your
medicine regularly

531
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,923
- Recognize her?
- Of course

532
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,050
- Who?
- Your mother

533
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,525
That's my wife!

534
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,632
This Chedathy (elder sister)?

535
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,033
lt's because l married her
l am known as Chedathy Sabu

536
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,866
She was a bootlegger

537
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,065
l met her when l went
to get some distilled booze

538
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,574
She gave me love

539
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:54,770
Next day l asked her
if she'd come away with me

540
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:57,507
She was all ready
She even had her bags packed

541
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:03,511
Now l realize
love is deaf and blind!

542
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:06,146
When you should be
driving a scooter...

543
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,158
...you are driving a Benz

544
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,557
lt's all in the spirit of the game

545
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,424
Whateverthe game
look how she is built

546
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,199
My husband has told me
a lot about you

547
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,462
Madam, is your headache better?

548
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,131
Madam?

549
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:24,435
She's good with such niceties

550
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:25,975
Be quiet, Sabu'chaya

551
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,476
Welcome, madam

552
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,678
Achayya, come

553
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,718
What do you want?
Tea or coffee?

554
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,213
Tea, please

555
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:41,747
Wash your hands
lt's obvious you haven't eaten

556
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,590
l've cooked Puttu and Kadalai
(steamed cake and chickpea curry)

557
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:45,753
l'm not hungry

558
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,761
But you must eat
before your medicine, right?

559
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,800
There's water out there
Go on

560
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,708
Did your wife distil it?

561
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:11,413
Of course, the booze she distils
Wowww!

562
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:14,452
She's my Mahalakshmi
(Goddess of wealth)

563
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:17,820
l haven't got even
a mini-Lakshmi in my life

564
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,055
Well! Blame it on my forefathers

565
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:24,124
Generations have lived
only with stolen wealth

566
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,761
Will anybody give their girls
to thieves or mendicants?

567
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:30,705
You only burgled and stole
Not murdered or mutilated!

568
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,003
Then why did you reel out
'quotation rates' in the car?

569
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,099
Have you begun that also?

570
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,780
Actually, it was
only for her benefit

571
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,179
To let herthink
l was awesome

572
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,184
You are clever indeed!

573
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,714
This is beef fry

574
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:46,980
The beef fry she makes
Wowwww!

575
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,624
Sure! Yes!

576
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,161
Our girl is eating Puttu-Kadalai

577
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:55,630
The Puttu-Kadalai she makes!
Wowwwww!

578
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,792
Don't tease!

579
00:38:56,901 --> 00:39:02,601
Annama, tell her some
good traits about our Sam'achayan

580
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,641
Let her become a little romantic

581
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,834
l feel she is already like that

582
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,614
She liked you, that's why
she asked you to travel with her

583
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,170
That's true

584
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:16,584
A girl will go with only
the man she likes, isn't it?

585
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,848
- Get lost, dear
- Go away, you thief!

586
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:24,656
You are so clever
One of the best ideas ever!

587
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,563
You know our Samson'chayan?

588
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,131
He's a pearl, a real gem!

589
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:33,465
When you are together
you become a precious pair

590
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:37,630
Only because he likes you
he traveled with you

591
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:42,201
A man will accompany a woman
only if he likes her

592
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:45,880
He was the one
who got us married!

593
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:49,645
He told us even then
how much he liked you!

594
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,654
Sabu, she's overdoing it!

595
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,724
His heart is full of you

596
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:55,588
Last week...

597
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,661
Sunday comes only this week

598
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:58,758
How's the fever?

599
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,990
Touch herforehead and see

600
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,556
Go on, check!

601
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,531
Only if you see
you'll know, isn't it?

602
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:05,125
Go on...check

603
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,670
Why this shyness?
She's not a stranger

604
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,830
Go on

605
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,964
Go ahead

606
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,769
-Are you feeling feverish?
- Yes, may be slightly warm

607
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,410
Who is this good shepherd?

608
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,450
Annamma, it's Zuber
with a goat and vessels

609
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:26,482
So today we'll eat
mutton biriyani by Annama

610
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:29,822
- The biriyani which she makes
- Wowwwwwwwwww!

611
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,552
This is 2nd show collection

612
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:34,120
2nd show?

613
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,859
Yeah, when people are off
to watch a late night movie

614
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,093
...no one will be at home

615
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:39,497
That's true

616
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,664
Long ago when Shakeela's movies
were played on TV at midnight...

617
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,900
...we had good hauls

618
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:47,603
People wouldn't budge
even if the house caught fire!!

619
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:50,703
We quit, when the channels
stopped those films

620
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:53,444
Catch them

621
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:54,575
Zuber! Run

622
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,550
Stop

623
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,184
Sir...sir

624
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,788
- Sir, what is the problem?
- Move aside, l say

625
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,586
Wait, let me explain

626
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,724
Don't step on the chillies

627
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:09,699
Where is that fellow Sabu?

628
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,166
He was right here all this while

629
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,896
Don't put on an act for me

630
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,939
He has chopped off the leg
of a Government official

631
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,902
But he's not brought it here!

632
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:20,709
Who are you?

633
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:22,544
Who is she?

634
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,706
We are guests, sir
'Guests are equal to God'

635
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,014
You must be similarly
employed like them, eh?

636
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,819
Sir, no one's here
They've all run away

637
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:37,525
Go on, pamper him
l'll catch him some day

638
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:38,960
And later l'll pick you up also

639
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,621
Oh! That's tough

640
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,699
All those who tried
fell into their own traps!

641
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:45,064
Till today
no one has succeeded

642
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,661
So don't bother
Just go away

643
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,441
Come

644
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,750
- Sabu chaya?
- Yes?

645
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,457
Sabu?
Where is he?

646
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,542
Sabu, whose brilliant idea is this?

647
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:27,668
All credit to my wife!

648
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:31,943
Sister, you are not Annamma
You are a treasure (Ponamma)

649
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:36,681
l intend staying here for a week
l need to take lessons from you

650
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:40,450
Hey kid, bring her bag
We are leaving

651
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,820
How can you do this?

652
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:44,190
l thought we'll spend some time
together...eat...then leave

653
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,729
lt's not that l don't want to
But we must travel quite far

654
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,798
l must visit Dasan on the way

655
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,897
Just drop us at the bus stop

656
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,803
You don't come, in case
that lnspector sees you

657
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:56,931
Go, drop them

658
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,634
Both of you stand together

659
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:01,636
May you be forever wedded!

660
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,612
Tell me when you have
special news, okay?

661
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:15,457
l'm craaaazy about driving!

662
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:16,856
What 'make' is your vehicle?

663
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:19,555
Vehicle in my house?

664
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,061
Who will buy a vehicle
when petrol prices sky-rocket?

665
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:27,795
Fools buy vehicles and
park them at home to show off

666
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,873
When we feel
like driving a car...

667
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,532
...wejust lift one
from there and drive it

668
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,546
When petrol is over
just park it and walk off

669
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:39,683
So we get pleasure
driving a vehicle

670
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,681
Police have the pleasure
of finding the lost vehicle

671
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:47,819
The owner has the pleasure
of getting back his lost car

672
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:50,587
See how many people
get pleasure this way?

673
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,820
lf we buy a car,
can we give such pleasure?

674
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:54,693
No

675
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:57,492
That's why it's called
'a pleasure trip'!!

676
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:58,861
Have you taken your medicine?

677
00:43:58,969 --> 00:43:59,799
Ouch!

678
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:16,117
Who is the boy getting beaten?

679
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,518
He's a money lender, Joey

680
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:21,217
He's being beaten by a thug
Chemban (Copper) Solly

681
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:23,219
He's also our Sabu's enemy

682
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:29,590
ls there cash in it for me?

683
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,894
Try your luck

684
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:36,930
Let's try, eh?

685
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,549
Joey, my boy!

686
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:55,519
Your Sam'achayan is here

687
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,655
Get up

688
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:03,426
Oh my little one
has been beaten to a pulp

689
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,696
Come here
Let me ask

690
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:09,900
What's the problem?

691
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:12,100
He took a loan
of Rs 1 ,50000 from me

692
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:14,076
When l asked him to repay it,
he's beating me up

693
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:17,045
l'll get your money back
and return his blows to him

694
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:17,910
...what do l get?

695
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:20,745
Anything you ask
lt's a question of prestige

696
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,152
Come, my boy

697
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,153
Who has the gall to beat him?

698
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:28,989
Did you think he doesn't have
anyone to defend him?

699
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,583
Who are you?

700
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:33,720
Didn't you hear me?
Joey's Sam'achayan

701
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:36,023
lf you take
you must give

702
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,931
Otherwise you get it

703
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:27,842
Are you hurt?
Take care, okay?

704
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:56,636
Sam'achaya!!

705
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,890
- When will you repay his money?
- Tomorrow

706
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:17,152
Don't beat me any more

707
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:19,125
lf you don't
l'll come back

708
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,218
My dear Chembu

709
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,988
When l bend you over
and kick you

710
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,931
...we'll hear a musical note 'tup'

711
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,194
The sound of your spine breaking

712
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:30,206
Don't invite me again
to listen to it, okay?

713
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:33,207
Go, sit in the car, Joey

714
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:48,088
Puncture
ls there a spare tyre?

715
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,794
Why would we want to
buy one for a stolen car?

716
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,889
Never

717
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,029
Try to thumb a lift

718
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,231
l'll be right back

719
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:13,039
-Are you going via Pulpally?
- Sure

720
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:14,946
- We are 2 of us
- Get in

721
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:17,011
- Tell Sabu
- Okay

722
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:18,054
Come

723
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:38,835
l've heard there's a woman
behind every successful man

724
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,944
l realized it today

725
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,604
That call Sam'achaya!

726
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,547
l escaped by the rat's whiskers

727
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:48,685
So here's a gift
From me to you

728
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:03,960
Going through worldly joys
gives happiness to the soul

729
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:07,227
Spiritual route also
gives happiness to the soul

730
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,098
Cheruvathur route too
gives happiness to our soul

731
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,505
Which God-man (Swami)
lives in Cheruvathur?

732
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:13,598
That's my home

733
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,869
One look at that place
it brings great happiness

734
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,106
That's how it should be

735
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,617
A house needn't be
a fancy mansion!

736
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,911
lt should give happiness

737
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:27,089
A wife needn't be
fair and beautiful

738
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,216
She should give contentment

739
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,087
When l see the 2 of you
l visualize a family...

740
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,859
...full of happiness
and contentment

741
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:40,098
- What is your star?
- 12th Lunar asterism, regulus

742
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:48,968
The harmful phase of Saturn
is over from yesterday

743
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,073
lmprisonment was also
in the chart for you

744
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,914
Can even be
prison of the mind!

745
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:00,020
Your bad time is over
Only good times hereafter

746
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,248
Since you've said so much...

747
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,925
...why don't you tell us
about his job, swami?

748
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,560
That's not necessary

749
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:08,727
How can he do that?
lsn't that right, swami?

750
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,924
l like challenges

751
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:13,867
Your face will tell me
what your profession is

752
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:28,514
Ah! We've reached the jetty

753
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:35,249
Come

754
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:41,988
Sir!

755
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:46,225
Sir, you are from
the Criminal investigation dept?

756
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:51,673
Yes, l'm investigating a case
So don't tell anyone

757
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:55,838
No, l will not
Can you give me Rs 10?

758
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,583
Thank you

759
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:02,242
Come

760
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:06,620
Which is the house of
Cheerappanchira Das?

761
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,282
Oh, that thief Das?

762
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:10,322
He's at Kannurjail
Not at home

763
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:11,655
- l know that
- Get in

764
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,693
Come

765
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,400
Mother, they are here

766
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,513
l am Samkutty

767
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:39,245
Who is this?

768
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:41,187
- My spouse
- Huh?!

769
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:42,857
My wife!

770
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:45,156
What's your name?

771
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,592
- Mallika
- l am Jalaja

772
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,722
What happened to yourforehead?

773
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,231
That is...on the way

774
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:55,293
lt's a long story
All my mistake

775
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:58,665
l wanted her to wear heels

776
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:00,209
So l bought her a pair

777
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,607
Just 2 steps and
she fell flat on her face

778
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:03,168
Oh God!

779
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:04,679
By God's grace
only a small injury

780
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,679
Do you want hot water to bathe?

781
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,141
- No
- This is her problem

782
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:13,188
However cold the weather is
she'll shower only in cold water

783
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,416
- ls it money?
- Yes

784
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,352
Give it to her
Or she'll take my life out

785
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:22,823
What's that?

786
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,431
Dasan's letters to Jalaja
Do you want them?

787
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:29,596
No! There'll be nothing
worthwhile to read

788
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,237
Useless fellow

789
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,901
Come, let's go in

790
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:42,217
lt's a bit inconvenient

791
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:44,913
lt's okay
We'll adjust, dear?

792
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:49,316
Rememberthis
when you both sleep on it

793
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:53,695
One of the legs
of this cot isn't steady

794
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:56,330
Mother, you are impossible!
Go away

795
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,129
- l thought l'd remind you
- Sure

796
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,833
Wearthis night dress

797
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:10,636
You can eat dinner
after your shower

798
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:23,717
Sorry l told them
you were my wife

799
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:26,220
They'll think you are
a characterless woman

800
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:27,887
That will be bad

801
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:32,096
But your 'husband act'
was a bit over done

802
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,100
ls this how husbands behave?

803
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:38,339
l haven't been one so far
There's plenty of time to change

804
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:39,769
l'll go in to shower

805
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:50,483
Have you gone nuts?
26 missed calls!

806
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,279
l minute

807
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:59,352
l was eager to know
what was happening

808
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:02,359
- How is it?
- Tell me...quickly

809
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:03,763
She's waiting inside

810
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:07,734
Are you sleeping
in the same room?

811
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:08,701
Yes

812
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:11,203
- On a single cot?
- Yeah!

813
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:15,334
- Then do me a favor
- What favor?

814
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:20,746
Record in your mobile
so that l too can see it

815
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:24,752
Why mobile?
l'll arrange a video camera!

816
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:28,722
ldiot! Here l'm trying to
get into her good books!

817
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:29,814
Put down the phone!

818
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:31,285
Hello?

819
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,629
What happened?

820
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:38,161
Why do you look so shocked?

821
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:40,259
Firing has been declared in Libya!!

822
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,269
When?

823
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:44,364
This afternoon
You silly girl!

824
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,440
When did you leave home?

825
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:55,212
Last night
Reached Kannur in the morning

826
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:58,320
l too once went to see Das'aettan

827
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:01,248
Did he inform you
about his release?

828
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:05,260
He has to see me
when he gets out

829
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:10,231
l also feel the same way

830
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:13,428
Do you like him so much?

831
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:35,082
l usually practice yoga
after a shower

832
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:44,095
Old hag!
Nosey parker!!

833
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:07,854
Oh wow! l'm glad you are
wearing what l got for you

834
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:09,254
How blessed l am!

835
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:34,182
Aiyo! Kumkum is for
married women, right?

836
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,751
But l am married

837
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:36,911
Don'tjoke!

838
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:39,121
There are certain
formalities forthat

839
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,756
Formalities too are over

840
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:46,725
l've been married for 7 years

841
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,926
7 years?

842
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:58,636
His name is Manikuttan
A cattle dealer

843
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:02,177
Brings and sells cattle
from Pollachi

844
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:10,112
Since he deals with cattle
his nick name is 'cattle-Kuttan'

845
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:22,727
You get this load
to the market

846
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,629
That dumb Kidav will be there

847
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,765
Mallika?
Manikuttan has come

848
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,834
Mallika!
Your mother's calling you

849
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:44,075
l'll be right there
Mother, make some tea

850
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:45,845
You sit there, son

851
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:50,691
Tell your husband
you'll come after 2 days

852
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:52,589
No chance

853
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:56,189
lt was only because he went
for the load he left me here

854
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:57,824
He needs me
by his side all the time

855
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:00,198
You must get married
to understand all that

856
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,669
Bhavani!

857
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,177
He is stone drunk

858
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:09,677
Get me some water

859
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:14,516
Uncle has not missed
his routine today also

860
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:16,810
Didn't l ask you
for some water?

861
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,189
l am not getting up
until l clean this fish

862
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:22,522
l know why you want water

863
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:25,390
You can make your
fish curry after giving me water

864
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:26,721
Go woman!

865
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,194
l will chop your foot one day

866
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:30,892
On that day l'll kill you

867
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,931
Hey stop!
Give me that

868
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,602
l'll give you water

869
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:36,898
Let me do it for you

870
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:40,233
Here take it, my dear
Just a little

871
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:42,709
- Okay
- That's enough

872
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:45,906
You sea-turtle!
Women should be like her

873
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:51,844
Very mean! You said
you'll return yesterday...?

874
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:53,616
Shouldn't l get the cattle?

875
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:57,623
Couldn't you give me a call?
l didn't sleep a wink last night

876
00:59:57,727 --> 01:00:00,161
l slept like a log in the lorry

877
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:04,765
Stuck with cattle all the time
you are behaving like them

878
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:07,869
No wonder people
call you cattle-Kuttan

879
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,131
Cattle-Kuttan!

880
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:10,296
You!

881
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:25,711
Stop

882
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:27,618
What is it?

883
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:32,354
lf money is priority
these animals won't be sold

884
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:35,257
Sell them only
for the rate l've fixed

885
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:38,927
You'll have to
buy them yourself

886
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:54,576
Mani, Rs 6000 for the calf
Rs 2000 yesterday's loan

887
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:57,413
Rent for 2 months Rs 2000
Total Rs10000

888
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,284
Don't fret
You'll get your money

889
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:00,650
l want it before noon

890
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:02,190
l'll let you know by then

891
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:07,385
Hey! lt's like buying myself
a dog that bites!

892
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:10,489
Shiva'etta, there's a load of pepper
Will you join them to unload?

893
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:13,626
l cannot do such jobs
Only 'quotation' jobs

894
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:17,331
Shiva'etta, be quiet
Don't say such things

895
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:18,899
Where is Nirmala?

896
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,609
She and Sudhakar'ettan
left early this morning

897
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,145
Didn't say where

898
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:25,337
They'd have gone
to perform their usual stuff?

899
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:26,109
Usual stuff.

900
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:29,549
Great! This stupid girl
doesn't understand anything

901
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,678
My dear, a ritual to see
that they get a baby

902
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:56,241
What happened, Nirmala?

903
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:58,176
l don't want to live any more

904
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:00,681
l want to die
Just die!

905
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:03,415
What is it?

906
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:08,083
l came twice this morning
Where were you?

907
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:10,887
We went to the hospital

908
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,154
Did you see the doctor?

909
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,389
- Yes
- And?

910
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:24,333
Nirmala's situation is very bad

911
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:28,206
Doctor said Sudhakar'ettan
cannot father a child!

912
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:29,836
Poor thing!

913
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:37,309
After some days
l got to know

914
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:41,790
Something was going on
between my husband and her

915
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,824
l did not take it seriously

916
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:49,125
During dinner
one night l asked him

917
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,202
l also heard
Do you believe all that?

918
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:57,400
No

919
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,303
People will always
say such things

920
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:01,467
You don't get upset over this

921
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:06,673
Will you swear on me
there's nothing like that?

922
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,482
Just for the sake of
my peace of mind?

923
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:14,280
No! Don't!
l trust you

924
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:18,393
Go and see who it is

925
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:27,426
Sudhakar'ettan?

926
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:29,403
Move aside

927
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:33,899
Da!

928
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,406
Catch that dog!

929
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:12,105
AiyO! Listen to me
Don't do anything to him

930
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:13,773
No, listen to me

931
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:16,317
Let me go, woman!

932
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:24,359
You think you can live here
happily after ruining my life?

933
01:04:57,426 --> 01:05:00,554
2 more bends
and we'll reach Karippa

934
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,358
You can stay at my place
and leave tomorrow

935
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:09,394
No, that will not be right

936
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:13,370
100 questions to answer
What, where, why, who etc

937
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:14,736
All that is unnecessary

938
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:18,208
l'll leave you there
With that my job is done

939
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:20,782
When this bus returns
l will go back in it

940
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:23,908
Mani will be waiting for you

941
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:28,346
Put the past behind
and live happily hereafter

942
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:41,199
You dare conduct a protest march?

943
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,473
lsn't that Chettiar Shivan?

944
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:57,614
Yes, he's making
life impossible here

945
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:09,855
Let's go!

946
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,503
All of you can alight here

947
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:52,700
- lsn't that Mallika?
- Yes

948
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:06,354
So there's sure to be
another murder today

949
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:17,822
Shop - for rent

950
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:28,830
Hold it properly

951
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:44,817
What, da?

952
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,717
Seeing her
is your bowel churning?

953
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:49,791
- l'll be back
- Stay here, Kidav, my boy

954
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:01,097
Where is my husband?

955
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,602
- He...hmmm
- Tell her!

956
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:47,048
Mallika!
Don't!!

957
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:56,853
So what l heard years ago is true!

958
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:58,359
What did you hear?

959
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:01,362
Explain why you killed
that chap for no real reason

960
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:04,364
Tell everyone here
Let us know

961
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:07,026
So you don't know
why l killed him, right?

962
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:08,535
You don't know, eh?

963
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:11,799
Hell with you

964
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,844
Stop!

965
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,542
Stop...please!

966
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:31,449
What is it?

967
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,748
l must check
if someone is here

968
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:33,788
Go ahead

969
01:11:34,156 --> 01:11:35,885
What a nuisance!

970
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:42,096
Fast, we have a long way to go

971
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:46,331
Quickly lady! Come out
Allow us to leave

972
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:52,500
Jobless nomads wandering around!

973
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:53,802
Okay, let's go!

974
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,828
l don't have a specific place to go

975
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:15,897
Nor is there anyone waiting for me

976
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,363
What does it matter when l leave?

977
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:18,491
l'll catch the next bus

978
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:21,432
Don't go
Come with me

979
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:23,701
l have something to tell you

980
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:01,599
Made for each other!!

981
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:06,540
What a combination
Like beef fry and brandy

982
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:25,557
Who is this?

983
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:30,604
Sudhakar'ettan who died
His elder brother, Vijayan

984
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:03,296
Some unknown vagabond
Don't know details about him

985
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,702
That's another issue with C.P

986
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:07,002
l interfered mildly

987
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:08,599
He's with me
l'll hand the phone to him

988
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:10,304
l'm driving
C.P...?

989
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:11,676
- Who is it?
- Kozhi Pannikar

990
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:15,715
Yes...that's a long story

991
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:17,945
Jose from lllickal is trying
to act smart with me

992
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:20,920
He is accusing me of misusing
my power as a politician

993
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:23,287
He wants me prosecuted

994
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:25,724
So he is organizing
a protest march tomorrow

995
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:29,491
l wanted him battered
My friend here did a neatjob

996
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:31,463
He under estimated me!

997
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:34,564
He was thrashed
right, left, centre!

998
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:38,104
He won't walk again
Leave alone march!!

999
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,332
We are seeing Mani now
We'll meet this evening

1000
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:42,341
Okay

1001
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:57,490
Come...welcome

1002
01:14:57,659 --> 01:14:59,820
Today it's a full day
to be fulfilled!

1003
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:04,356
Celebrating the acquisition
of my 1st wife's new husband

1004
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:06,366
Come on, Kidav
Serve 1 for me

1005
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:08,299
Did you see her companion?

1006
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:11,667
No
Not yet the right time

1007
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:12,672
l saw him

1008
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:13,673
How is he?

1009
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:17,041
1 strong blow and
he'll fall, that's all

1010
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:19,306
Sure he'll fall, but not
the one who hits him!

1011
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:22,345
You didn't see him
properly, did you Kidav?

1012
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:24,646
True...not very well

1013
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,984
Anyway, be relieved
she's off your hands

1014
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:28,079
l was quite worried

1015
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:34,395
...she would do 'satyagraha'
to get back her husband back

1016
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:36,691
Nirmala
God is on your side

1017
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:38,789
Let him live-in with her
Or she shack up with him

1018
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:42,303
They can do as they please
We are happy, eh, Shiva?

1019
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,396
l got 1 more in my ward

1020
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:47,634
l want to know who he is
and what his intentions are?

1021
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:50,001
l will undertake that task

1022
01:15:54,816 --> 01:15:57,979
Mallika's mother was almost
dead, when she went to jail

1023
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:00,682
When Mani started
living with Nirmala...

1024
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:02,348
...she never recovered

1025
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:04,085
ln a way, good she passed away

1026
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:05,884
She didn't have to
go through all this

1027
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:10,293
l came to Kannurto inform
Mallika of her mothers death

1028
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,095
l didn't tell her about Mani then

1029
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,836
l felt she also would die if l did

1030
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:21,803
Hey Keshava!

1031
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:27,637
My wife

1032
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:30,616
l mean she used to be my wife
But now she is my husband!

1033
01:16:31,853 --> 01:16:33,514
She turned mad

1034
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:39,293
Mallika, l specifically asked
the minister to send you by flight

1035
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:42,557
lt was my order
Can anyone disobey?

1036
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:43,689
Can they?

1037
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,590
No, of course not

1038
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:54,768
- Where are you from?
- From the north

1039
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,640
ls the wedding of Unniarcha's
(legendary warrior) over?

1040
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:59,305
Yes, last month

1041
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:04,450
Was it the sword man
who married her?

1042
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:06,350
Yes
Kunjiraman indeed!

1043
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:08,787
He was in the Gulf
Now both are in Saudi Arabia

1044
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:10,791
- He deserves it
- Sure he does

1045
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:13,793
What, Keshava? Standing like
you've swallowed a spear

1046
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:15,420
Don't you know
you must clean the fish?

1047
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:16,929
Yes, l'll do it now

1048
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:18,390
Goodness!

1049
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:21,627
The whale in the pot
will soon start to rot

1050
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:23,637
lt all happened with my foot

1051
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:27,732
One day when she was
cleaning fish, l kicked her

1052
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:31,301
She used the knife
in her hand to chop my leg

1053
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,872
Thus l became lame
and she turned mad

1054
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:37,315
She's the husband
and l'm the wife now

1055
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:38,318
lsn't that great?

1056
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:02,839
My daughter Sunanda
Her husband is in the Gulf

1057
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:04,946
She's foreverthrilled about it

1058
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:07,742
l got a call when
l was at the bank

1059
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:10,478
That Malli has come and
accompanied by a man!

1060
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:11,813
- ls he that man?
- Yes

1061
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,911
- l am Su-
- Sunanda, l know you

1062
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:15,354
Oh my goodness!

1063
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:17,687
Where is Mallika?
Malli?

1064
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:21,886
ls only the mother mad
or is the daughter too affected?!

1065
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:33,931
lt's been ages

1066
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:35,735
Don't tell my wife, Bhavani

1067
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:38,745
Never! Not from my mouth!

1068
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:51,449
He's drinking in there
That Keshava'ettan is with him

1069
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:53,892
Keshava'ettan seems
to be very happy today

1070
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:56,055
Bhaskar, another bottle of toddy

1071
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:01,860
lf we drink toddy here...

1072
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:04,872
...we don't have to take pills
for blood pressure and diabetes

1073
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:05,907
Why?

1074
01:19:05,974 --> 01:19:09,432
He grinds most of those
pills to concoct this stuff

1075
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:12,843
Keshava'etta, don't talk too much

1076
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:18,883
Shiva

1077
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:21,548
Vagabonds have settled
themselves in houses here

1078
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:25,559
- Let's order a liverfry
- Okay, go ahead

1079
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:31,691
- Have you heard of Chettiar Shivan?
- No

1080
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,496
But l've heard of Sambashivan

1081
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,833
Don't laugh
lt'll soon fade

1082
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:39,031
He is Shivan
Chettiar Shivan

1083
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:42,440
- What's your name?
- Sylvester Stallone

1084
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:44,068
- Are you mocking?
- Yes

1085
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:49,782
This town hasn't sheltered
or nurtured vagabonds

1086
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,976
Such bad policies will change now

1087
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,850
Don't! Any more dialogs and
this bottle will be smashed

1088
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:56,856
You better clear off
by dawn tomorrow

1089
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:58,790
You don't have to break bottles

1090
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:00,725
Neither do you
need to wait for dawn

1091
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:03,627
Come outside
and l'll clobber you

1092
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:05,461
- Then come out, da
- l'll come, da

1093
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:07,399
Please Shiva
Don't create problems

1094
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:09,629
There's no reason
for a brawl here

1095
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:16,576
C.P, please take him away
Come, let's go

1096
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,078
He doesn't know me

1097
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:21,641
- This town is abnormal
- l am even more so!

1098
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:26,050
- Then come
- Go, not now

1099
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:32,658
My treat

1100
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:35,423
l'm so happy that the man
with Mallika is a real man

1101
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:37,988
- Make him drink it up
- He is with me on this

1102
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:40,829
No need of a fresh drink
Just give me the bill

1103
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:42,630
- What's your name?
- l am Jacob

1104
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:43,864
Mallika is very close to us

1105
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:46,565
l am Samson
l need to talk to you

1106
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:47,774
Go ahead

1107
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:53,275
Were Nirmala and Mani
in love for a long time?

1108
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,881
What love?
lt's all just like a story

1109
01:20:56,017 --> 01:21:00,647
An accountant in herfather's shop
was Nirmala's 1st husband Sudhakar

1110
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:03,917
She married him
as herfather insisted

1111
01:21:04,559 --> 01:21:07,027
She was always dissatisfied

1112
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,557
lt became worse
when she found out...

1113
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:10,995
...he couldn't father a child

1114
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,100
Mani was a spectator to all this

1115
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:17,600
He just took advantage
and became close to her

1116
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:19,804
He was after her money

1117
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:23,311
And she wanted an heir
to her father's riches

1118
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:29,840
Don't people here know that
Mallika killed to save Mani's life?

1119
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:33,547
Of course!
Even the kids are aware

1120
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:45,892
What's wrong with this fellow?

1121
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:57,577
You'd do anything
for money, right?

1122
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,840
Haven't you realized
that by now?

1123
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:02,078
You must do me a favor

1124
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:05,910
This house and land will
fetch me about Rs 30,00000

1125
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:07,981
l'll give you the entire amount

1126
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:09,317
Tell me what the issue is

1127
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:12,322
You must kill a man

1128
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:14,922
Cattle-Kuttan

1129
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:18,896
l must see him dead
with my own eyes

1130
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:21,931
You don't have to spend
all that money to kill him

1131
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:23,664
Even half of it is enough

1132
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:26,965
- Are you sure?
- Very sure

1133
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:29,805
But l can't do it
chasing him like a dog

1134
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:32,038
There will be a time
and place for it

1135
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:34,707
- You can stay here till then
- Okay

1136
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:37,715
There's a cot inside
You can sleep there

1137
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:39,411
Just 1 cot is enough!!

1138
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:44,014
Give me a mat and a pillow
l'll sleep out here

1139
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:46,953
No, it's very cold here

1140
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:49,963
My body will not
get frozen by cold

1141
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:53,631
l'm bored being alone
A friend will join me tomorrow

1142
01:22:53,702 --> 01:22:55,670
lf you have any objections
tell me right away

1143
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:57,704
No objections
Who is he?

1144
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,831
Kochapi
Mr Kochapi

1145
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,347
Achaya!

1146
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:09,775
Hello! Come...come

1147
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:11,375
Oh! My goodness!

1148
01:23:13,955 --> 01:23:17,721
You used to be like
a ripe jackfruit bulb

1149
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:18,816
What's wrong now?

1150
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:21,020
Even now you look the same
No change at all

1151
01:23:21,129 --> 01:23:24,428
lfjail gives you such glamor
l too want to be in jail

1152
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:27,263
Even a life-term will not
make you look any better

1153
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:29,997
- Who is this?
-An uncle related to Mallika

1154
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:31,037
Quite a weird chap!

1155
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:32,038
l am Kochapi

1156
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:33,267
What do you do?

1157
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:35,275
To accompany Sam'achayan
to ward off evil eyes

1158
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:36,469
Your face is fit forthat

1159
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:38,978
lsn't it? We need to get
to know each other better

1160
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:40,514
Not necessary at all

1161
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:46,419
Kochapi, that lady
is a little improper

1162
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:47,920
How do you know that?

1163
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:51,083
Her face says it all!

1164
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:59,694
Didn't l tell you?

1165
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:00,932
What's her name?

1166
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:04,369
Sathi, her husband
divorced her long ago

1167
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:07,772
- Her name should be chathi (cheat)
- Correct! Not bad

1168
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,400
Hey! Vijayan

1169
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:11,069
So you do know my name

1170
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:13,041
Then what?
You are famous, aren't you?

1171
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:14,843
What is the connection
between you and Mallika?

1172
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:15,905
Nothing so far

1173
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:18,976
But cannot guarantee
the same for the future

1174
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:20,816
Human beings are
of flesh and blood

1175
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:23,323
ln a weak moment
anything can happen

1176
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:24,687
You should
forgive me then, okay?

1177
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:26,055
-Are you mocking me?
- No

1178
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:28,322
l want to know
why you are here?

1179
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:31,824
Kochapi, he seems to be serious

1180
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,424
- Let's tell him, right?
- Shoot

1181
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:36,395
lt's a scheme for
'job confirmation'

1182
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:39,335
The 'job' is to kill and
'confirmed' l'll be paid

1183
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:40,271
Kill whom?

1184
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:43,002
Just pray it's not you

1185
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:48,974
He went around saying
the day she came out...

1186
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,312
...he'd kill Mallika

1187
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:51,976
He may actually
try something, okay?

1188
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:57,789
He sure will

1189
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:07,262
Hey! Stop there

1190
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:12,566
What is it?

1191
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,435
Tell me what's the issue

1192
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:16,066
Are you playing some game?

1193
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:17,743
Hey! Tell me your problem

1194
01:25:17,812 --> 01:25:20,474
His sister and l are in love
He's chasing me to kill me

1195
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:21,947
Please save me

1196
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:26,285
l will
What will l get in return?

1197
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:27,319
Anything

1198
01:25:27,422 --> 01:25:28,354
- Sure?
- Yes

1199
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:30,448
Come, my nephew
Let me ask him

1200
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:37,597
- What's the problem?
- Who the hell are you to ask?

1201
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:39,324
l am his uncle

1202
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,664
Uncle or whoever
Move out of my way!

1203
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:42,792
And if l don't?

1204
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:45,065
Then you will get it from me

1205
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:14,961
Vijayan! Move away

1206
01:26:16,538 --> 01:26:18,938
l told you to move aside, didn't l?

1207
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,841
Come this way, Vijayan!

1208
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:51,066
Why do you ask to be beaten?

1209
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:21,596
Such a handsome guy
in love with your sister

1210
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:24,661
You couldn't ask for more
Get them married, you...!

1211
01:27:58,439 --> 01:27:59,337
Come on

1212
01:28:01,075 --> 01:28:03,873
Hey! lsn't it John sir?
l couldn't recognize you at all

1213
01:28:03,978 --> 01:28:05,639
Me too
Why are you here?

1214
01:28:05,713 --> 01:28:08,273
l came to see all of you

1215
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:11,775
Have you come to take revenge?

1216
01:28:11,853 --> 01:28:15,016
No, my dearest sir
l forgot all that long ago

1217
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,489
Get them to the station

1218
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:22,523
l will myself
bring these fellows

1219
01:28:22,597 --> 01:28:23,962
Get into the vehicle

1220
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:26,491
Oh Mother Mary!

1221
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:57,293
ls this a bandit's hide out?

1222
01:28:57,365 --> 01:28:59,993
l think so
They look like thugs

1223
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:03,359
Come inside, da!
Go

1224
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:04,871
-Aren't you coming?
- l will

1225
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:06,700
Greetings, 'thug brother'!

1226
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:31,921
My dear Samkutty
forgive me

1227
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:34,759
l made a mistake last time

1228
01:29:34,936 --> 01:29:38,736
The police arrested the real culprit
behind the gold burglary

1229
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:40,841
l misunderstood you

1230
01:29:41,008 --> 01:29:45,536
lf you've come for revenge
l beg you, not to harass me

1231
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:47,042
Let me just live my life quietly

1232
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:50,978
My dear John sir
Don't hurt me with such words

1233
01:29:51,085 --> 01:29:53,485
You can beat me
with the same hand l broke

1234
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:54,885
Ouch! Ouch!

1235
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:58,016
Don't hold my hand
lt's set with steel plates

1236
01:29:58,526 --> 01:29:59,493
Steel?

1237
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:01,562
Yes
Stainless steel

1238
01:30:02,296 --> 01:30:04,890
l can never punch
anybody with this hand

1239
01:30:04,966 --> 01:30:09,266
Those thugs outside ensure
that l'm not beaten up

1240
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:12,995
Offenders are only
advised these days

1241
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:16,532
Constant sermons have
turned this place unfit to live

1242
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:20,775
Good you are here
l need you for a few days

1243
01:30:20,882 --> 01:30:22,042
l need your help

1244
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:26,376
- Hereafter l will...
- Ouch, steel

1245
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:30,049
...be your right hand, sir
This Samson will be there

1246
01:30:31,959 --> 01:30:35,520
l am very happy, Samkutty
Very thrilled!

1247
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:36,597
Come on, tell us

1248
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:38,959
Don't beat me

1249
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:43,969
Tell us the truth
Or l'll punch the...

1250
01:30:44,505 --> 01:30:45,904
Don't beat me

1251
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:49,042
You lying rascal
You refuse to tell the truth, eh?

1252
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:51,471
l'll pummel your guts out

1253
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:55,246
What punches!

1254
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,748
- Tell us
-Ask me first

1255
01:30:57,819 --> 01:31:00,811
ls this a quiz competition
for question-answer session?

1256
01:31:00,888 --> 01:31:03,356
l'll punch your rib cage to bits

1257
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:07,019
Sir, it was l who stole the cow

1258
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:09,729
So you do know
to reply without question, eh?

1259
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:11,662
l'll churn your abdomen

1260
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:16,403
This should be enough
forjust stealing a cow

1261
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:17,267
ls it?

1262
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:19,032
Only you know such details

1263
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:20,433
Okay, let's stop

1264
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:23,966
Come here

1265
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:32,747
Ramesh! Take him and
come back with the evidence

1266
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:37,048
Buy him enough food, okay?
l've battered him badly

1267
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:38,986
Get going

1268
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:43,056
Fellows like him come
intent on ruining my hand!

1269
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:45,663
Now let's go around
A little show

1270
01:31:45,733 --> 01:31:46,961
Morning show
or noon show?

1271
01:31:47,034 --> 01:31:48,501
A full show

1272
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:20,997
Dai! 3 juice

1273
01:32:21,068 --> 01:32:22,365
With plenty of sugar

1274
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:25,566
Aren't these the chaps
you took in yourjeep?

1275
01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:27,231
Yes, does it bother you?

1276
01:32:27,308 --> 01:32:29,708
My dear sir
l take back my question

1277
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:30,777
Bring the juice

1278
01:32:32,513 --> 01:32:35,573
My responsibilities should
be safe in your hands

1279
01:32:35,683 --> 01:32:37,981
Rest assured
it will be safe

1280
01:32:44,892 --> 01:32:47,383
Don't stop me
This is an ambulance

1281
01:32:47,495 --> 01:32:48,553
l am carrying a body

1282
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:50,654
Ambulance?
Where is the body?

1283
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:51,857
- l am the body
- What?

1284
01:32:51,966 --> 01:32:53,957
l'm rushing with
my damaged liver

1285
01:32:54,035 --> 01:32:55,434
Don't stop me, sir

1286
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:57,638
Not bad, eh?

1287
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:00,534
What is this board for?.

1288
01:33:00,608 --> 01:33:05,011
Govt. insists on this board
to warn about drinking

1289
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,009
He's drowned in it
Let him go

1290
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:09,674
Otherwise cannot claim pension

1291
01:33:10,818 --> 01:33:11,842
Go...go

1292
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:13,978
Brothers
Cheers!

1293
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:20,349
We'll never know
when he'll be useful

1294
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:22,822
Ambulance
Hey! Give way

1295
01:33:22,897 --> 01:33:24,387
- Get lost, da
- Oh God!

1296
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:28,334
Stop!

1297
01:33:30,638 --> 01:33:31,502
Get out

1298
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:32,868
Put the bike aside

1299
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:34,638
What is your problem, sir?

1300
01:33:34,742 --> 01:33:36,437
How many will you
take on this bike?

1301
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:38,637
Depends on
how smart the rider is

1302
01:33:38,913 --> 01:33:41,848
Charge a case, sir
l'll see you in court

1303
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:44,874
Move aside, sir
Harassing unnecessarily

1304
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:05,470
Whatever you wish for
l make it come true

1305
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:06,972
Smart fellow!

1306
01:34:13,014 --> 01:34:15,278
That is cattle-Kuttan

1307
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:50,948
'House and land for sale'

1308
01:34:51,052 --> 01:34:53,543
He deserves to be
called cattle-Kuttan

1309
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:55,054
He has all
the traits of a beast

1310
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:58,417
Be on guard
l came to tell you that

1311
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:02,257
Stork has seen so many ponds!
But the reverse is also true!!

1312
01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:04,422
- lsn't it, Sam'achaya?
- Of course

1313
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:11,934
What's this, C.P?
A group demo here

1314
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:13,529
l'll explain by and by

1315
01:35:13,607 --> 01:35:15,700
l am C.P
C.Pavithran

1316
01:35:15,843 --> 01:35:17,811
The Panchayat member
of our ward for 10 years

1317
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:19,243
Tell us what you've come for

1318
01:35:19,313 --> 01:35:20,371
Call Mallika

1319
01:35:22,683 --> 01:35:24,548
l came to see you

1320
01:35:24,618 --> 01:35:26,051
What is it?

1321
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:31,281
As a Panchayat member, l must
enquire about immoral activities here

1322
01:35:31,358 --> 01:35:34,555
We want to know if these men
you've allowed to live here...

1323
01:35:34,662 --> 01:35:37,460
...are terrorists or murderers

1324
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:41,666
What else
do you want to know?

1325
01:35:41,802 --> 01:35:45,397
Has he married you
or is he just...

1326
01:35:46,006 --> 01:35:47,439
You...!

1327
01:35:50,344 --> 01:35:54,246
There was once a man
who legally lived with me

1328
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:56,781
Have you cared
to find where he is now?

1329
01:35:56,917 --> 01:36:00,353
Have you enquired
with whom he is living now?

1330
01:36:00,821 --> 01:36:03,756
No one shall dare
come into this place

1331
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:05,882
lf they do
l'll chop his leg off

1332
01:36:06,026 --> 01:36:07,050
Get out, da

1333
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:11,256
Malli!
Come in

1334
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:12,960
l'll leave now

1335
01:36:13,334 --> 01:36:16,929
But don't think
l'll keep quiet on this issue

1336
01:36:17,338 --> 01:36:17,997
Let's go

1337
01:36:18,272 --> 01:36:19,739
C.P sir, please wait

1338
01:36:24,411 --> 01:36:27,005
Are you the renowned
Sir C.P to issue orders?

1339
01:36:27,081 --> 01:36:28,548
Or are you moral police?

1340
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:32,651
Even if the entire town protests
not just you, l'd still be here

1341
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,621
l've enough spunk in me
That's why l came with her

1342
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:38,624
Go back and tell those
fellows who sent you...

1343
01:36:38,726 --> 01:36:41,923
...since Mani has shifted himself
to another cattle shed

1344
01:36:42,029 --> 01:36:43,997
...he had better return
all that he took as dowry

1345
01:36:44,265 --> 01:36:45,892
Or you get it from him
and give it to her

1346
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,458
C.P you will soon be
minus your honors!

1347
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:51,467
What he said
just now is right

1348
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:56,339
l did think of this myself

1349
01:36:56,443 --> 01:36:58,502
Why don't we give
a police complaint?

1350
01:36:58,646 --> 01:36:59,476
We will

1351
01:37:12,526 --> 01:37:14,050
What brings you here, sir?

1352
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:16,825
Your behavior demands it

1353
01:37:31,378 --> 01:37:33,278
We've received
a complaint against you

1354
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:34,711
l've come to inform you directly

1355
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:35,816
What's it about?

1356
01:37:36,283 --> 01:37:39,810
A complaint from Mallika
who used to be your wife

1357
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:46,553
For having left your legal wife
and living with another woman

1358
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:51,495
The dowry of 25 sovereigns
or its equivalent of Rs 5,00000

1359
01:37:51,599 --> 01:37:54,227
Plus Rs 2,00000
in cash you had received

1360
01:37:54,368 --> 01:37:57,269
Total sum of Rs 7,00000
to be returned is the complaint

1361
01:37:57,638 --> 01:37:59,606
You can forward it to the court

1362
01:37:59,707 --> 01:38:01,607
We'll take care of the case
Now you can go, sir

1363
01:38:01,675 --> 01:38:03,506
Who are you to give opinions?

1364
01:38:03,577 --> 01:38:06,546
Panchayat member,
don't step into my space

1365
01:38:06,814 --> 01:38:10,477
1st of all tell me the relationship
between these two, let me hear

1366
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:14,616
When the husband died
she slept with his friend

1367
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:15,689
And they had a baby

1368
01:38:15,756 --> 01:38:17,553
Otherwise what bond
do they both share?

1369
01:38:17,658 --> 01:38:21,355
ls there any proof
that he's the father?

1370
01:38:27,368 --> 01:38:28,858
Don't go yet, lady

1371
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:39,372
lf you still want him around
as father to your child...

1372
01:38:39,613 --> 01:38:44,380
...the money has to reach
the station tomorrow morning

1373
01:38:44,718 --> 01:38:47,551
Otherwise he'll be
taken away and you

1374
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:50,552
lmmoral traffic
will be the offence

1375
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:51,918
Understood?

1376
01:39:08,876 --> 01:39:09,865
How do you use this?

1377
01:39:10,878 --> 01:39:13,244
- How does this look?
- No glamor at all

1378
01:39:13,347 --> 01:39:14,314
Then you wear it

1379
01:39:14,381 --> 01:39:15,814
Look at me now
How is it?

1380
01:39:15,916 --> 01:39:17,747
Aiyo! Black magic spirit

1381
01:39:40,374 --> 01:39:43,832
Oh there they are!
This is punctuality

1382
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:45,878
You are not
what l thought you were

1383
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:47,746
l now realize
you are quite cultured

1384
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:49,373
Sit please...sit

1385
01:39:51,385 --> 01:39:53,615
Here is the amount Rs 700000

1386
01:39:53,687 --> 01:39:54,847
Give it to him

1387
01:39:57,257 --> 01:39:58,747
For having slept with me

1388
01:39:59,393 --> 01:40:02,362
Consider it as wages
Go and give it to her

1389
01:40:06,367 --> 01:40:08,232
Be a little more respectful

1390
01:40:08,469 --> 01:40:10,733
l cannot be more
respectful than this

1391
01:40:11,305 --> 01:40:14,570
l can't figure out
what your role is in this

1392
01:40:14,775 --> 01:40:16,834
lf it is money you want
just say so

1393
01:40:16,944 --> 01:40:18,844
Money?
Get out, l say!

1394
01:40:20,581 --> 01:40:25,280
lf you think this position and
those 2 vagabonds will aid you...

1395
01:40:25,386 --> 01:40:27,513
...let me tell you,
they won't last!

1396
01:40:27,621 --> 01:40:30,351
Pah! You cheap rascal
Are you threatening me?

1397
01:40:31,525 --> 01:40:34,892
lf that's how you feel
l am not denying it

1398
01:40:37,998 --> 01:40:39,397
Come, let's go

1399
01:40:41,769 --> 01:40:43,737
He's feeling the pinch
of paying this money

1400
01:40:46,774 --> 01:40:50,642
l don't want his money
You can keep it

1401
01:40:50,911 --> 01:40:53,345
The rest l'll pay
after l sell this place

1402
01:40:53,514 --> 01:40:55,038
l'll spend it if it's with me

1403
01:40:55,382 --> 01:40:56,644
Keep it safely
in the cupboard

1404
01:40:57,017 --> 01:41:00,714
After my job is done
give it to me as a bulk amount

1405
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:09,629
Samkutty's arrival
has spiced up life here

1406
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:14,893
He's got many ideas
which l'm unable to figure out

1407
01:41:15,369 --> 01:41:18,861
l too have tried to find out
But he refuses to tell

1408
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:31,918
Both of them are panic-stricken

1409
01:41:36,957 --> 01:41:38,515
Okay, l'll see you

1410
01:41:46,467 --> 01:41:48,367
Keshava'etta, one moment

1411
01:41:52,973 --> 01:41:55,999
What is the relationship
between Mallika and that chap?

1412
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:58,469
l don't know
Why don't you ask her?

1413
01:41:58,579 --> 01:42:00,672
So you don't know, eh?

1414
01:42:01,381 --> 01:42:03,474
- Tell
- Leave him

1415
01:42:03,584 --> 01:42:04,608
Get lost, da

1416
01:42:05,552 --> 01:42:07,543
You are ganging up
with that stranger...

1417
01:42:07,621 --> 01:42:09,748
...to get back at us, right?
Who is he to you?

1418
01:42:09,823 --> 01:42:11,757
Let him be anybody
Let go of my shirt

1419
01:42:49,696 --> 01:42:52,688
Arrest Chettiar Shivan!

1420
01:42:52,799 --> 01:42:55,927
Put an end to
Chettiar Shivan's goondaism!

1421
01:42:56,036 --> 01:42:58,630
Police should bring justice

1422
01:42:58,739 --> 01:43:02,505
Police!
End his tyranny

1423
01:43:02,809 --> 01:43:06,404
We have searched
for him high and low

1424
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:08,208
We have no clue
as to where he is

1425
01:43:08,749 --> 01:43:12,810
Samkutty, you must rescue me

1426
01:43:13,687 --> 01:43:17,714
Tell them he'll be put inside
before 6:00 PM today

1427
01:43:17,824 --> 01:43:19,689
- ls that true?
-All lies

1428
01:43:20,928 --> 01:43:23,522
We can have peace
at least till 6 in the evening

1429
01:43:23,630 --> 01:43:25,894
Go and tell them

1430
01:43:31,538 --> 01:43:33,699
- Kochapi!
- Coming, achaya

1431
01:43:36,877 --> 01:43:39,402
- What?
- Go outside

1432
01:43:39,513 --> 01:43:41,777
You call me and pretend
to be someone else

1433
01:43:41,882 --> 01:43:43,440
Just reply, okay?

1434
01:43:47,955 --> 01:43:50,981
They stopped their slogans
Now what?

1435
01:43:54,828 --> 01:43:57,456
Hello

1436
01:43:58,031 --> 01:43:59,692
Can't hear, l'll come out

1437
01:44:00,467 --> 01:44:02,731
Yes, now l can hear
Tell me

1438
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:04,737
Road to the north

1439
01:44:05,038 --> 01:44:06,733
From there...take a right

1440
01:44:07,507 --> 01:44:09,805
Yes, understood
We'll be there right away

1441
01:44:09,876 --> 01:44:11,434
Thangachan
Be right there, okay?

1442
01:44:11,678 --> 01:44:14,010
Sir, we've found
Shivan's hide out

1443
01:44:14,281 --> 01:44:16,545
- Let's go
- Oh my God!

1444
01:44:18,852 --> 01:44:20,479
Why are you shutting the door?.

1445
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:22,279
lt's foolish to delay

1446
01:44:22,456 --> 01:44:24,515
Let's go right now
and arrest him

1447
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:25,250
Arrest who?

1448
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:27,554
That wasn't Lord Shiva
or His consort Parvathi!!

1449
01:44:27,661 --> 01:44:28,628
lt was Kochapi
from the bathroom

1450
01:44:28,695 --> 01:44:29,753
l don't understand

1451
01:44:29,863 --> 01:44:31,956
That's not my fault
lt's a fault with your brains

1452
01:44:32,733 --> 01:44:34,667
Now it is 12:35

1453
01:44:34,835 --> 01:44:37,303
Wait till 12:40 and
l'll show you

1454
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:38,927
- What?
- Just wait and watch

1455
01:44:42,509 --> 01:44:45,444
Ask everybody to place
their mobile phones on the table

1456
01:44:45,579 --> 01:44:48,013
Everybody place
your phones on the table

1457
01:44:48,815 --> 01:44:50,612
Come on quickly

1458
01:44:50,917 --> 01:44:52,885
Phone?
Why, sir?.

1459
01:44:53,253 --> 01:44:55,721
To boil and eat it
Keep it here

1460
01:45:00,627 --> 01:45:03,619
John sir,
looking at this scenario...

1461
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:07,995
...every thug in any place
will have a spy at the police station

1462
01:45:08,335 --> 01:45:10,565
Similarly, if there is a spy here...

1463
01:45:10,671 --> 01:45:13,799
...Shivan would have
been informed by now

1464
01:45:13,974 --> 01:45:17,910
lf you examine calls
between 12:35 and 12:40

1465
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:19,445
...you can find out who it is

1466
01:45:19,579 --> 01:45:21,706
Hey you are James Bond, l say!

1467
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:23,248
Super intelligent

1468
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:27,980
Just because you can't nab the culprit
harassing the police is not right

1469
01:45:28,288 --> 01:45:29,653
What's this chap's role here?

1470
01:45:29,756 --> 01:45:30,848
My dear Ramesh sir

1471
01:45:31,024 --> 01:45:33,788
As remote as a cat is
to the goldsmith...

1472
01:45:33,894 --> 01:45:37,295
...so is the tell-tale sign of
the feather on a chicken-thief!

1473
01:45:40,634 --> 01:45:42,795
lt is Ramesh sir's phone

1474
01:45:43,070 --> 01:45:44,594
Suppose it is Shivan?

1475
01:45:44,705 --> 01:45:48,197
l'll kick Ramesh out
and disinfect the premises

1476
01:45:49,543 --> 01:45:51,602
Don't answer
lt is Shivan calling

1477
01:45:51,678 --> 01:45:54,203
l know where he is
l'll take you there

1478
01:45:54,681 --> 01:45:56,308
Smart fellow!

1479
01:45:56,583 --> 01:46:01,020
You show me Shivan now
l'll show you something later

1480
01:46:01,321 --> 01:46:04,313
Tell us where he is

1481
01:46:28,815 --> 01:46:31,648
Ramesh sir
Come, show us

1482
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:41,550
There he is, sir

1483
01:46:41,661 --> 01:46:42,628
Hello

1484
01:46:44,698 --> 01:46:45,756
He's gone

1485
01:46:50,737 --> 01:46:52,830
Caught you!
End of game!

1486
01:46:53,607 --> 01:46:55,802
- He's gone again
- Don't let him leave

1487
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:05,743
Never run after
declaring end of the game

1488
01:47:06,286 --> 01:47:08,311
l won't ever leave you

1489
01:47:15,295 --> 01:47:17,855
You thought l was stupid

1490
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:26,739
Oh my steel!

1491
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:29,208
Samson!

1492
01:47:35,615 --> 01:47:36,547
One more

1493
01:48:09,683 --> 01:48:11,583
Now what do you
want to know about me?

1494
01:48:11,651 --> 01:48:14,882
Who l am?
What my intentions are?

1495
01:48:15,322 --> 01:48:16,755
l'll tell you everything, da

1496
01:48:17,791 --> 01:48:20,021
Your boss
cattle-Kuttan

1497
01:48:20,794 --> 01:48:25,822
He is the beast on which
a good price has been fixed

1498
01:48:25,966 --> 01:48:27,331
A beast to be butchered!

1499
01:48:29,302 --> 01:48:33,363
Now do you understand
that l am abnormal?!

1500
01:48:35,008 --> 01:48:37,602
Sir, now he's all yours

1501
01:48:38,845 --> 01:48:39,743
Come

1502
01:48:39,913 --> 01:48:43,405
l will decide now, whether
you should be released or not

1503
01:48:48,455 --> 01:48:51,822
Mani!

1504
01:48:52,025 --> 01:48:52,684
What?

1505
01:48:52,859 --> 01:48:54,292
l met Shivan now

1506
01:48:54,394 --> 01:48:55,793
l also found out why
Samson is here

1507
01:48:55,896 --> 01:48:57,295
Tell me

1508
01:48:57,664 --> 01:48:59,825
Mallika has given a quotation

1509
01:49:00,634 --> 01:49:02,602
- Why?
- To kill him!

1510
01:49:11,778 --> 01:49:14,406
Chey! Stop scolding me
Others will hear you, woman

1511
01:49:14,481 --> 01:49:16,881
You know l'll keep up my word
Do l have a choice?!

1512
01:49:16,983 --> 01:49:18,712
Don't talk any more, bye

1513
01:49:18,852 --> 01:49:21,912
Do you know when husbands
started losing their peace of mind?

1514
01:49:22,055 --> 01:49:23,215
l've never been a husband!

1515
01:49:23,290 --> 01:49:25,417
You will one day
So heed my words

1516
01:49:25,492 --> 01:49:28,427
Thanks to the mobile phone
even if you go to pee...

1517
01:49:28,495 --> 01:49:31,828
...where, why, when did you go
Not a minute of peace in life

1518
01:49:31,898 --> 01:49:35,231
Bro, if l don't go back
she may find another guy

1519
01:49:35,302 --> 01:49:37,532
Let's finish ourjob
as fast as we can

1520
01:49:37,604 --> 01:49:39,765
We won't get pleasure
finishing it off so fast!!

1521
01:49:39,873 --> 01:49:41,465
Hello brother!

1522
01:49:43,610 --> 01:49:45,578
Stop your ambulance

1523
01:49:46,046 --> 01:49:47,513
Hey! Don't fall off

1524
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:52,314
l'm lnstallment Chinnappan
Because l take small pegs...often

1525
01:49:52,385 --> 01:49:54,319
We have a debt between us

1526
01:49:54,487 --> 01:50:00,016
You rescued me and
my damaged liver from the police

1527
01:50:04,331 --> 01:50:06,663
What! A bar attached scooter?.

1528
01:50:06,733 --> 01:50:08,428
Come, my dears!

1529
01:50:08,802 --> 01:50:10,429
Let's have a drink together

1530
01:50:10,503 --> 01:50:10,969
That's good

1531
01:50:11,037 --> 01:50:12,436
Not when Diwakaran is there

1532
01:50:12,505 --> 01:50:13,529
Who is he?
Your daddy?

1533
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:15,006
Not daddy
The sun above

1534
01:50:15,308 --> 01:50:17,538
Sam'achayan will not drink
unless it is dark!

1535
01:50:17,611 --> 01:50:19,636
So he can close his eyes

1536
01:50:19,713 --> 01:50:21,578
That's true
But not today

1537
01:50:21,681 --> 01:50:26,516
Come a little more
Back up...yes

1538
01:50:27,554 --> 01:50:28,919
Enough stop...stop

1539
01:50:46,606 --> 01:50:47,868
What is it, achaya?

1540
01:50:50,443 --> 01:50:51,467
Whose vehicle is this?

1541
01:50:51,778 --> 01:50:55,976
Our cattle-Kuttan Mani
He wants the paint changed

1542
01:51:10,597 --> 01:51:13,896
Brother Mani, l need
cash to buy paint

1543
01:51:29,516 --> 01:51:30,710
But still, how...!

1544
01:51:37,524 --> 01:51:40,550
l'm not delaying it anymore
You can sell the house and land

1545
01:51:47,867 --> 01:51:48,731
Come

1546
01:51:48,802 --> 01:51:50,895
What's this, Jacob'achaya,
with an army behind you?

1547
01:51:50,970 --> 01:51:52,369
l am out to settle a deal

1548
01:51:52,439 --> 01:51:54,907
Mallika has been pestering me
to get her house and land sold

1549
01:51:55,008 --> 01:51:56,771
l am obliged to do it

1550
01:51:56,876 --> 01:51:59,640
Go ahead, go in
Mallika, show them...

1551
01:52:00,013 --> 01:52:01,947
Samkutty, 1 minute

1552
01:52:03,650 --> 01:52:05,515
Our cattle-Kuttan has
opened a new account

1553
01:52:05,585 --> 01:52:06,381
Which bank?

1554
01:52:06,453 --> 01:52:08,284
Not bank
ln Sathi's house

1555
01:52:08,354 --> 01:52:09,946
Didn't l tell you
she was a hooker?

1556
01:52:10,023 --> 01:52:11,718
She's been that way from
the time she was born

1557
01:52:11,791 --> 01:52:12,621
And so is he

1558
01:52:12,692 --> 01:52:14,353
Some traits are inborn
lnevitable

1559
01:52:14,494 --> 01:52:15,859
He's bored with Nirmala

1560
01:52:15,929 --> 01:52:18,454
He now practically
lives at Sathi's place

1561
01:52:38,451 --> 01:52:40,442
A woman gets
intoxicated from her man

1562
01:52:41,521 --> 01:52:42,920
Come here, my girl!

1563
01:52:43,890 --> 01:52:49,886
- The fire has been kindled
- lt will soon reach its zenith

1564
01:52:49,996 --> 01:52:51,964
We can watch till dawn

1565
01:52:52,232 --> 01:52:54,757
- No, it will burn out before that
- Chey!

1566
01:52:59,939 --> 01:53:02,567
The silly woman
Can't she go to sleep?

1567
01:53:02,709 --> 01:53:04,700
- Probably Nirmala, eh?
- Yes

1568
01:53:05,678 --> 01:53:08,875
Why, da?
Are you already tired of her?.

1569
01:53:10,016 --> 01:53:12,712
She's the spirit
that guards her wealth

1570
01:53:12,952 --> 01:53:17,218
One day, l'll inherit all that
Till then l must put up with her

1571
01:53:18,024 --> 01:53:20,788
l doubt if you'll live
long enough forthat

1572
01:53:21,227 --> 01:53:25,721
You yourself said that Mallika
has arranged to get you killed

1573
01:53:27,367 --> 01:53:30,825
How will she, when she won't
be alive to get me killed?!

1574
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:37,406
- Now we have a new task?
- lt's all part of the game

1575
01:54:09,309 --> 01:54:12,278
lt's me, Kochapi
Open the door

1576
01:54:23,790 --> 01:54:25,621
Someone was out there...!

1577
01:54:25,959 --> 01:54:28,223
He is right here

1578
01:54:33,032 --> 01:54:35,592
He came to kill you
With knife

1579
01:54:38,771 --> 01:54:41,399
Kill her, da!
You won't?

1580
01:54:41,875 --> 01:54:43,809
You won't be able to kill

1581
01:54:43,877 --> 01:54:47,210
l always knew
you were a coward

1582
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:50,408
lf you really wanted justice
1st you should've killed Nirmala

1583
01:54:50,516 --> 01:54:52,882
Didn't she ruin
your brother's life?

1584
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:55,881
lf someone came to kill you...

1585
01:54:55,955 --> 01:54:58,981
...your wife who loved you
won't stand idle, will she?

1586
01:54:59,225 --> 01:55:01,853
Mallika did what
any other wife would do

1587
01:55:03,963 --> 01:55:08,297
She loved her husband
She reacted that way

1588
01:55:16,042 --> 01:55:17,270
Wait, don't go

1589
01:55:20,647 --> 01:55:27,780
You can take revenge
by other ways than murder

1590
01:55:27,954 --> 01:55:29,717
l will teach you

1591
01:55:29,923 --> 01:55:33,188
Just stand by me, that's all
What do you say?

1592
01:55:42,869 --> 01:55:45,770
Kochapi!
Light it

1593
01:55:47,607 --> 01:55:48,801
Oh mother!

1594
01:55:57,350 --> 01:55:58,874
- Shall l cut it?
- Yes, please

1595
01:56:41,661 --> 01:56:43,390
Come, let's go from here

1596
01:56:56,009 --> 01:56:57,840
l liked that very much

1597
01:56:57,910 --> 01:57:01,903
That will take care of destroying
Nirmala's peace of mind forever

1598
01:57:02,248 --> 01:57:05,877
Let's talk of something else
This doesn't interest me

1599
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:07,877
But l am totally interested

1600
01:57:07,987 --> 01:57:09,784
To see those 2 separate...

1601
01:57:09,856 --> 01:57:12,620
...do you know
how hard l prayed?

1602
01:57:35,481 --> 01:57:38,939
They should have died
That driver messed it up

1603
01:57:39,252 --> 01:57:42,221
Doesn't matter
My vehicle will still run

1604
01:57:42,355 --> 01:57:43,982
l will finish her myself

1605
01:57:44,290 --> 01:57:46,781
Either her or him

1606
01:58:01,374 --> 01:58:03,842
There he runs
Go catch him

1607
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:10,110
Get out
Get out, l say

1608
01:58:10,216 --> 01:58:13,515
l know what to do
with the pair of you!!

1609
01:58:25,264 --> 01:58:27,232
Come out here, my 'lady'

1610
01:58:32,338 --> 01:58:34,602
When l get complaints
about immoral affairs...

1611
01:58:34,740 --> 01:58:37,800
...l am forced to take action
like you had once remarked

1612
01:58:37,910 --> 01:58:39,673
...as long as l hold this position

1613
01:58:39,779 --> 01:58:41,940
So get into the jeep

1614
01:58:42,615 --> 01:58:45,743
1st a medical test
and then the court

1615
01:58:45,918 --> 01:58:49,911
And a small bit of news
in tomorrow's newspaper

1616
01:58:50,389 --> 01:58:51,549
Come

1617
01:58:53,326 --> 01:58:54,293
Walk ahead

1618
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:02,358
l'll come back

1619
01:59:02,869 --> 01:59:04,734
l'll eagerly wait for you!

1620
01:59:27,293 --> 01:59:28,954
What are you doing, dear?

1621
01:59:29,629 --> 01:59:31,460
l am shutting down business

1622
01:59:31,597 --> 01:59:35,499
All of you can give the keys back
And collect your dues

1623
01:59:38,471 --> 01:59:39,938
How can you do this suddenly?

1624
01:59:40,206 --> 01:59:43,198
This is my shop and
l decide when to close down

1625
01:59:43,342 --> 01:59:45,469
Pillai sir, close all their accounts

1626
01:59:46,812 --> 01:59:48,677
Don't pick the phone

1627
01:59:49,282 --> 01:59:51,580
l have put an end
to all my dealings today

1628
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:32,482
Stop right there

1629
02:00:35,294 --> 02:00:36,989
You were a big mistake in my life

1630
02:00:37,263 --> 02:00:39,788
Today l have set it right
You can go

1631
02:00:42,335 --> 02:00:45,566
l'm not someone
you can order around

1632
02:00:45,671 --> 02:00:48,435
You will go
You are nobody to me

1633
02:00:49,242 --> 02:00:52,541
l'll ensure you get your due
You...!!!

1634
02:00:55,381 --> 02:00:56,370
Let go...!

1635
02:02:56,669 --> 02:02:58,569
A tramp beats up
one of our people

1636
02:02:58,637 --> 02:03:02,368
How can you stand watching it?
Go batter him to death

1637
02:03:39,712 --> 02:03:40,940
Please, wait a second

1638
02:03:42,314 --> 02:03:43,679
l have an emergency meeting
l'll be right back

1639
02:03:43,749 --> 02:03:45,239
You can go but
don't come back

1640
02:03:45,317 --> 02:03:47,581
Otherwise l will form a committee
and impose 'emergency' on you!

1641
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:50,188
God! What kind of fate is this?

1642
02:05:35,528 --> 02:05:38,656
When you got into this liaison
you should have realized...

1643
02:05:38,731 --> 02:05:42,258
...he also had a wife
who was left in tears

1644
02:05:42,401 --> 02:05:45,768
How were you so sure that a man
who had cheated on his own wife...

1645
02:05:45,871 --> 02:05:48,169
...wouldn't do the same to you?

1646
02:06:04,823 --> 02:06:06,518
You did not kill him, did you?

1647
02:06:06,992 --> 02:06:09,961
- No, l didn't
- But you promised

1648
02:06:10,429 --> 02:06:14,763
l sold my house and land
Trusting you, l waited for you

1649
02:06:15,501 --> 02:06:17,162
Why did you back off?

1650
02:06:17,503 --> 02:06:19,164
lt wasn't because l couldn't

1651
02:06:19,471 --> 02:06:21,632
1 blow and
he would have been dead!!

1652
02:06:26,845 --> 02:06:29,336
With just a wall between us
in Kannur Central Jail

1653
02:06:29,415 --> 02:06:32,213
...for many years
we lived as strangers

1654
02:06:33,385 --> 02:06:38,687
After getting to know you
l thought why go back

1655
02:06:40,693 --> 02:06:43,491
l know it is wishful thinking
But still...

1656
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:49,759
l don't want to
go back to my old job

1657
02:06:49,835 --> 02:06:51,769
l want to work and live happily

1658
02:06:52,705 --> 02:06:55,697
lf you'll come with me
it will be fulfilling

1659
02:07:11,890 --> 02:07:14,688
Do you know why
he made you sell your place?

1660
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:15,749
Not forthe money

1661
02:07:15,894 --> 02:07:18,727
But to take you away

1662
02:07:18,797 --> 02:07:21,527
Look at him sitting
so innocent and well-behaved!

1663
02:07:21,767 --> 02:07:23,598
Hello brother!
Brother!

1664
02:07:24,503 --> 02:07:26,368
Look Sam'achaya!
Our ambulance man

1665
02:07:26,472 --> 02:07:27,530
Stop

1666
02:07:27,740 --> 02:07:29,173
Why?

1667
02:07:29,475 --> 02:07:31,409
Let's share a small!

1668
02:07:31,710 --> 02:07:33,439
Sam'achaya, why not?

1669
02:07:33,545 --> 02:07:35,706
No!
The sun above!!

1670
02:07:36,649 --> 02:07:38,810
Oh! l forgot!

1671
02:07:40,586 --> 02:07:41,848
Okay, okay...

1672
02:07:45,891 --> 02:07:46,755
Muah!

1673
02:07:47,826 --> 02:07:48,918
See you again, bye

1674
02:07:52,297 --> 02:07:55,198
Are you the skylark humming
a song of honeyed sweetness?

1675
02:07:55,267 --> 02:07:57,895
The maiden whose eyes sparkle
like stars in shyness?

1676
02:07:57,970 --> 02:08:03,636
Coral jasmine blossoms anew
Beautiful girl...who are you?

1677
02:08:03,742 --> 02:08:09,476
A random stranger out of the blue
You fill up my senses...true

1678
02:08:09,548 --> 02:08:15,180
Unchecked, without walls you appear
ln my dreams, who are you, my dear?

1679
02:08:19,525 --> 02:08:21,959
